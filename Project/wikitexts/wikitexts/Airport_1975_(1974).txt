It was directed by [[Jack Smight]], produced by [[William Frye (producer)|William Frye]] and [[Jennings Lang]], and written by Don Ingalls.<ref name=\"Airport 1975\">{{cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/19453/Airport-75/|title=Airport 1975|work=[[Turner Classic Movies]]|access-date=March 1, 2016}}</ref> The film stars [[Charlton Heston]], [[Karen Black]], [[George Kennedy]] and [[Gloria Swanson]]{{snd}}as a fictionalized version of herself{{snd}}in her final film role.<ref>Heston 1995, p. 520.</ref>\n\nThe plot concerns the dramatic events aboard an airborne [[Boeing 747]] when a small aircraft crashes into the [[cockpit]], causing the fatalities of senior crew and the blinding of the pilot, leaving no one aboard qualified to take the controls. ''Airport 1975'' was the seventh highest-grossing movie of 1974 at the US and Canada box office.\n{{TOC limit|limit=2}}\n\n==Plot==\nColumbia Airlines Flight 409 is a [[Boeing 747]]-100 on a [[red-eye flight]] from [[Washington Dulles International Airport]] to [[Los Angeles International Airport]], while Scott Freeman is a businessman flying his private [[Beechcraft Baron]] to a sales meeting in Boise, Idaho. However, an [[occluded front]] has the entire West Coast of the United States socked in, with Columbia 409 and Freeman's Beechcraft both diverted to [[Salt Lake City International Airport]].\n\nSalt Lake air traffic control assigns Columbia 409 to land ahead of Freeman's Beechcraft. As Columbia 409 is about to start its descent, First Officer Urias unlocks himself from his seat to check out a vibration. Just then, Freeman suffers a heart attack and uncontrollably ascends into the approach of Columbia 409.  The Beechcraft slams into Columbia 409 just above the co-pilot seat, ripping a hole through which Urias is ejected from the jet, while killing the flight engineer and sending debris that blinds the jet's pilot, Captain Stacy. Stacy is able to engage the autopilot and the altitude hold switch before losing consciousness. Nancy Pryor, the First Stewardess, rushes to the flight deck.\n\nNancy informs the Salt Lake control tower on the status of the cockpit crew, and that there is no one to fly the plane, while also giving an assessment of the damage. Joe Patroni, Columbia's Vice President of Operations, is apprised of Columbia 409's situation. He seeks the advice of Captain Al Murdock, Columbia's chief flight instructor, who also happens to be Nancy's boyfriend, though their relationship was \"on the rocks\" at that time.\n\nPatroni and Murdock take the airline's executive jet to Salt Lake. En route, they communicate with Nancy, learning that the autopilot is keeping the aircraft in level flight, but it is inoperable for turns. The jet is heading into the mountains of the [[Wasatch Range]], so Murdock starts to guide Nancy by radio on how to perform the turn when radio communications are interrupted and the Salt Lake tower is unable to restore contact.\n \nUnable to turn, leaking fuel and dodging the mountain peaks, an air-to-air rescue attempt is undertaken from an [[MH-53 Pave Low|HH-53]] helicopter flown by the US Air Force [[Aerospace Rescue and Recovery Service]]. While a replacement pilot is preparing to be extended on a tether from the helicopter to Columbia 409, Stacy is able to give a cryptic clue regarding the decrease in airspeed during a climb in altitude. Nancy realizes that she must accelerate to be able to climb over the mountains and successfully does so. After Columbia 409 has leveled off, the replacement pilot is released towards the stricken airliner. Just as Nancy is helping him in, the release cord from his harness becomes caught in the jagged metal surrounding the hole in the cockpit. Before he can climb in, his harness is released from the tether and he falls from the aircraft.\n\nThe only other person on the helicopter who can land a 747 is Murdock. He is tethered to the helicopter, lowered to the jet, and successfully enters it through the hole in the cockpit. He then lands the plane safely at Salt Lake City International Airport. However, he is forced to make high speed [[taxiing]] maneuvers, as a drop in brake pressure hampers his efforts to stop. Once the plane stops, the flight attendants successfully conduct an emergency evacuation of the passengers via the [[evacuation slides]], as Nancy and Murdock reconcile.\n\n==Cast==\n<!--- Cast and order per tombstone opening credits, roles per closing credits scroll --->\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Charlton Heston]] as Murdock\n* [[Karen Black]] as Nancy\n* [[George Kennedy]] as Patroni\n* [[Efrem Zimbalist Jr.]] as Stacy\n* [[Susan Clark]] as Mrs. Patroni\n* [[Helen Reddy]] as Sister Ruth\n* [[Linda Blair]] as Janice Abbott\n* [[Dana Andrews]] as Scott Freeman\n* [[Roy Thinnes]] as Urias\n* [[Sid Caesar]] as Barney\n* [[Myrna Loy]] as Mrs. Devaney\n* [[Ed Nelson]] as Major Alexander\n* [[Nancy Olson]] as Mrs. Abbott\n* [[Larry Storch]] as Purcell\n* [[Martha Scott]] as Sister Beatrice\n* [[Jerry Stiller]] as Sam\n* [[Norman Fell]] as Bill\n* [[Conrad Janis]] as Arnie\n* [[Beverly Garland]] as Mrs. Scott Freeman\n* [[Linda Harrison]] (credited as \"Augusta Summerland\") as Winnie\n* [[Guy Stockwell]] as Colonel Moss\n* [[Gloria Swanson]] as herself\n* [[Erik Estrada]] as Julio\n}}\n\nIn addition, [[National Football League|NFL]] player and future (1980, 1984) [[Super Bowl]]-winning quarterback [[Jim Plunkett]] has an uncredited cameo as himself.\n\n==Production==\n[[File:TMA Boeing 747-123(SF) (OD-AGM) at London Heathrow Airport.jpg|thumb|250x250px|The aircraft in question, operating for [[Trans Mediterranean Airways]]]]\n''Airport 1975'' used a [[Boeing 747#747-100|Boeing 747-123]] (s/n 20390.
