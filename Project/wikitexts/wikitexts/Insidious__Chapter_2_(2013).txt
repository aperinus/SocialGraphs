The film is a [[sequel]] to the 2010 film ''[[Insidious (film)|Insidious]],'' and the second installment in the [[Insidious (film series)|''Insidious'' franchise]], and the fourth in terms of the series's in-story chronology. The film stars [[Patrick Wilson (American actor)|Patrick Wilson]] and [[Rose Byrne]], reprising their roles as Josh and Renai Lambert, a husband and wife who seek to uncover the secret that has left them dangerously connected to the spirit world. The film was released September 13, 2013. A [[prequel]] film, ''[[Insidious: Chapter 3]]'', was released on June 5, 2015, and the storyline of this film will be continued in ''[[Insidious: Fear the Dark]]'' in 2023.\n\n== Plot ==\nIn 1986, Lorraine Lambert summons [[demonology|demonologist]] Elise Rainier to help her son Josh, who is being followed by the spirit of an old woman.  While attempting to confront [[paranormal|paranormal phenomena]] in the home, Elise's arm is inexplicably slashed by an unseen force. She insists that they must suppress Josh's [[astral projection]] abilities for his own safety and plant altered memories in his brain.\n\nTwenty-five years later, Josh's wife, Renai Lambert, is under questioning about the death of Elise. She is warned that if Josh's fingerprints are found at the crime scene, he will be prosecuted for Elise's murder. Josh, Renai and their children - Dalton, Foster, and Cali - relocate to Lorraine's house, where they again begin to encounter strange paranormal events.\n\nSpecs and Tucker, Elise's associates, visit Elise's house and discover a videotape of the 1986 investigation. Upon reviewing it, they find someone standing behind Josh in the video. Dalton tells his mother that he has been having bad dreams about a woman in a white dress, as well as hearing Josh talk to an unseen figure. Renai receives a call from the police stating that the fingerprints do not match Josh's. A woman in a white dress attacks Renai and Josh hears a voice urging him to kill his family.\n\nSpecs and Tucker show Lorraine the tape, enhanced to reveal it is an adult Josh standing behind the young Josh. They contact Elise's former colleague Carl, who attempts to contact Elise's spirit. They are told to find answers at an abandoned hospital, where Lorraine used to work as a doctor. Lorraine recounts the story of a patient named Parker Crane who was admitted for trying to castrate himself. Twenty-five years ago, she saw Parker and when she asked a nurse why he was out of bed, the nurse seemed confused and told Lorraine that he had jumped to his death the day before.\n\nThe group goes to the Crane family home where they find a secret room. Inside, they discover numerous corpses, a black wedding gown and newspaper clippings revealing Parker to be a killer referred to as \"The Bride in Black\" - who kidnapped and murdered young women while dressed as a woman himself.\n\nJosh's body begins to slowly deteriorate and Renai realizes he is possessed. Lorraine insists that they all get away from Josh. Carl, Specs and Tucker arrive to drug him but he subdues them. Carl awakens in the spirit realm of The Further, where he meets the spirits of the real Josh and Elise. It is revealed that time moves [[Chronology|non-chronologically]] in The Further, and Josh is able to communicate with himself as a child to figure out the location of Parker's house in The Further.\n\nIn the real world, the possessed Josh ambushes Lorraine and Renai. Renai and the children escape to the basement. Dalton voluntarily enters The Further to help his father. In The Further, Josh and the others find Parker's house. They witness Parker's mother, Michelle \u2013 the woman in the white dress \u2013 abusing him and forcing him to act like a girl. Parker had killed his victims at the behest of his mother's spirit. Elise saves Josh and appears to destroy Michelle's spirit, which stops the possessed Josh from murdering his family in the real world.  Parker's ghost disappears. Carl and Josh escape and Dalton leads them back to the living world, allowing Josh to finally regain control of his body. The Lambert family is finally reunited, with Josh and Dalton once again having their memories suppressed by Carl.\n\nSome time later, Specs and Tucker arrive at the house of a family whose daughter, Allison, is in an unexplained coma.  Unknown to them, Elise's spirit passes between them, going to Allison's room. She gasps as she sees something in the corner of the room.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Patrick Wilson (American actor)|Patrick Wilson]] as Josh Lambert\n** Garrett Ryan as young Josh\n* [[Rose Byrne]] as Renai Lambert\n* [[Ty Simpkins]] as Dalton Lambert\n* [[Lin Shaye]] as Elise Rainier\n** Lindsay Seim as young Elise\n* Steve Coulter as Carl\n** [[Hank Harris]] as young Carl\n* [[Barbara Hershey]] as Lorraine Lambert\n** [[Jocelin Donahue]] as young Lorraine\n* [[Leigh Whannell]] as Specs\n* [[Angus Sampson]] as Tucker\n* Andrew Astor as Foster Lambert\n* Brynn Bowie and Madison Bowie as Kali Lambert\n* [[Danielle Bisutti]] as Michelle Crane / Woman in White <!-- Production notes and Danielle confirmed this. -->\n* Tom Fitzgerald as Parker \"Marilyn\" Crane / Bride in Black\n** Tyler James Griffin as young Parker.
