Set in a [[dystopia]]n [[2019]], it tells the story of Sh\u014dtar\u014d Kaneda, a leader of a  [[b\u014ds\u014dzoku|biker gang]] whose childhood friend, Tetsuo Shima, acquires incredible [[telekinesis|telekinetic]] abilities after a motorcycle accident, eventually threatening an entire military complex amid chaos and rebellion in the sprawling futuristic [[metropolis]] of Neo-Tokyo.\n\nWhile most of the character designs and settings were adapted from the manga, the plot differs considerably and does not include much of the last half of the manga, which continued publication for two years after the film's release. The soundtrack, which draws heavily from traditional [[Music of Indonesia|Indonesian]] [[gamelan]] as well as Japanese [[noh]] music, was composed by [[Tsutomu \u014chashi|Sh\u014dji Yamashiro]] and performed by [[Geinoh Yamashirogumi]].\n\n''Akira'' was released in Japan on July 16, 1988, by [[Toho]]; it was released the following year in the United States by [[Streamline Pictures]].

Notice the amount of reclaimed land in the middle of [[Tokyo Bay]].]]\nIn 2019, following a [[world war]] triggered by the sudden destruction of [[Tokyo]] on July 16, 1988, Neo-Tokyo is plagued by corruption, anti-government protests, terrorism, and gang violence. During a violent protest, the hot-headed Sh\u014dtar\u014d Kaneda leads his vigilante ''[[b\u014ds\u014dzoku]]'' gang, the Capsules, against the rival Clown gang. Kaneda's best friend Tetsuo Shima inadvertently crashes his motorcycle into Takashi, an [[Extrasensory perception|esper]] who escaped from a government laboratory with the aid of a resistance organization. Assisted by fellow esper Masaru, [[Japan Self-Defense Forces]] Colonel Shikishima recaptures Takashi, has Tetsuo hospitalized, and arrests the Capsules. While being interrogated by the police, Kaneda meets Kei, an activist within the resistance movement, and tricks the authorities into releasing her with his gang.\n\nAt a secret government facility, Shikishima and his head of research Doctor \u014cnishi discover that Tetsuo possesses powerful psychic abilities similar to Akira, the esper responsible for Tokyo's 1988 destruction. Esper Kiyoko forewarns Shikishima of Neo-Tokyo's impending destruction, but the city's parliament dismisses Shikishima's concerns, leading him to consider killing Tetsuo to prevent another cataclysm. Meanwhile, Tetsuo escapes from the hospital, steals Kaneda's motorcycle and tries fleeing Neo-Tokyo with his girlfriend Kaori, but the Clowns ambush them. The Capsules rescue Tetsuo and Kaori, but Tetsuo begins suffering intense headaches and hallucinations and is taken back to the hospital.\n\nOverhearing their plan to rescue Tetsuo and the other espers, Kaneda joins Kei's resistance cell. At the hospital, the espers try killing Tetsuo via hallucinations, but the attempt is thwarted. A frustrated Tetsuo searches for them, killing any orderlies and militiamen blocking his path. The resistance group infiltrates the hospital, and Kiyoko draws Kei and Kaneda into Shikishima and the espers' futile attempts to stop Tetsuo. Kiyoko tells Tetsuo that Akira, located in cryonic storage beneath the Olympic Stadium's construction site, could help Tetsuo with his powers. After rejecting everyone around him, especially Kaneda, Tetsuo flees the hospital to hunt for Akira.\n\nKei, used by Kiyoko as a medium to stop Tetsuo, breaks her and Kaneda out of military custody. Shikishima stages a [[coup d'\u00e9tat]] against Neo-Tokyo's government and directs its military forces to destroy Tetsuo at any cost. At the Capsules' former hangout Harukiya Bar, Tetsuo confronts gangmates Yamagata and Kai over Kaneda's bike and kills Yamagata after his protest. Kai relays the news to Kaneda, who vows to avenge his friend, while Takashi brings Kei away. Mistaken for Akira by cultists, Tetsuo rampages through Neo-Tokyo, arriving at Akira's [[cryogenic storage dewar]] under the stadium. Kei fights Tetsuo, but he defeats her and exhumes Akira, only to find that his remains have been sealed in jars for scientific research.\n\nKaneda fights Tetsuo with a laser rifle, and Shikishima fires an [[orbital weapon]] at him. While the latter destroys his arm, neither is able to stop him. Shikishima and Kaori approach the stadium, where Tetsuo, now with a robotic arm, is in great pain and losing control over his powers. Kaori tries restraining Tetsuo while Shikishima unsuccessfully offers to heal his injuries and help control his abilities. Kaneda again fights Tetsuo who, weakened from the missing arm, mutates into a gigantic mass of flesh, engulfing Kaneda and killing Kaori. As the mass grows, the espers revive Akira to stop it. Reuniting with his friends, Akira creates a singularity, drawing Tetsuo and Kaneda into another dimension. The espers teleport Shikishima to a safe distance as the singularity destroys Neo-Tokyo in a mirror of Tokyo's previous destruction, and they agree to rescue Kaneda, knowing that they will not be able to return to this dimension as a result.\n\nIn the singularity, Kaneda experiences Tetsuo and the espers' childhoods, including his and Tetsuo's friendship and the espers' psychic training before Tokyo's destruction. The espers return Kaneda to Neo-Tokyo, informing him that Akira will take Tetsuo to safety and that Kei is developing psychic powers. \u014cnishi witnesses the birth of a universe but is killed in his lab's destruction. After consuming most of Neo-Tokyo, the singularity disappears and water floods the crater left in its place. Mourning Tetsuo's loss, Kaneda discovers that Kei and Kai have survived, and they ride off into the ruins while Shikishima watches the sunrise. \n\nThe film ends with Tetsuo introducing himself at an unspecified plane of existence where he triggers the creation of a universe, transcending the limitations of human life.\n\n== Voice cast ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\"|Character\n! rowspan=\"2\"|Japanese<ref name=\"CBM\" />\n! colspan=\"2\"|English\n|-\n! {{small|Electric Media/<br />[[Wally Burr|Wally Burr Recording]]/<br />[[Kodansha]]/<br />[[Streamline Pictures|Streamline]] (1989)}}<ref name=\"Streamline\">{{cite web |url=http://www.crystalacids.com/database/title/20/akira/ |title=Akira (movie) |publisher=CrystalAcids.com |access-date=August 24, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129025742/http://www.crystalacids.com/database/title/20/akira/ |archive-date=November 29, 2014 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n! {{small|[[Animaze]]/<br />[[NBCUniversal Entertainment Japan|Pioneer]] (2001)}}<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.crystalacids.com/database/title/19/akira/ |title=Akira (movie) |publisher=CrystalAcids.com |access-date=December 17, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160225155717/http://www.crystalacids.com/database/title/19/akira/ |archive-date=February 25, 2016 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://i.ibb.co/P1Y9KpZ/Akira.jpg|title=Voice actor call sheet}}</ref>\n|-\n!

The group's assembly was necessitated by the unconventionally high budget of around \u00a51,100,000,000, intended to achieve the desired epic standard equal to Otomo's over 2,000-page manga tale. The committee consisted of [[Kodansha]], [[Mainichi Broadcasting System]], [[Bandai]], [[Hakuhodo]], [[Toho]], [[NBCUniversal Entertainment Japan|LaserDisc Corporation]] and [[Sumitomo Corporation]] who all forwarded money and promotion towards the film.
