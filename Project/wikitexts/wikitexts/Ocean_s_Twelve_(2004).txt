The second installment of the ''[[Ocean's (film series)|Ocean's]]'' franchise and the sequel to ''[[Ocean's Eleven]]'' (2001), the film stars an [[ensemble cast]] consisting of [[George Clooney]], [[Brad Pitt]], [[Matt Damon]], [[Catherine Zeta-Jones]], [[Andy Garc\u00eda]], [[Julia Roberts]], [[Don Cheadle]], and [[Bernie Mac]].\n\nThe film was released in the United States on December 10, 2004. It received mixed reviews from critics and grossed $362 million worldwide, becoming the [[2004 in film#Highest-grossing films|tenth-highest-grossing film of 2004]]. It was followed by ''[[Ocean's Thirteen]]'' (2007), with Soderbergh and most of the cast again returning.\n\n== Plot ==\nTerry Benedict locates all eleven members of [[Danny Ocean (character)|Danny Ocean]]'s crew, demanding they return the $160 million [[Ocean's Eleven|they stole from his casinos]] plus $38 million in interest. He gives Danny's crew a two-week deadline to return the allotted sum. Short by half the amount, the group schemes to stage a heist in [[Amsterdam]] to avoid problems with U.S. authorities. They are tipped off by an informant named Matsui about the location of the first [[stock certificate]] ever issued. After a complex series of schemes, they find the document has already been stolen by the \"Night Fox\", another master thief. [[Europol]] detective Isabel Lahiri is called in to investigate the theft and realizes that she gave Rusty the idea of how to solve a complication of the heist with a description of a similar burglary during their earlier relationship. Surprising the group at their accommodations, she warns them they cannot beat the Night Fox or his mentor, the mysterious master thief known as \"LeMarc\",<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.dailyscript.com/scripts/oceans-12_roughdraft1.pdf|title=Spelling of \"LeMarc\" from the script}}</ref> both of whom excel in practicing the \"long con\", and steals Rusty's phone. She has been hunting both for years.\n\nDanny and his crew discover that the Night Fox is Fran\u00e7ois Toulour, a wealthy French [[baron]] and [[gentleman thief]] who has a villa on [[Lake Como]]. Danny goes to the villa and steals Toulour's paintings. He confronts Toulour, who reveals that he had exposed their identities to Benedict (breaking the code of silence among thieves) and hired Matsui to inform the crew about the stock certificate in order to arrange the meeting with Danny. Toulour is upset that LeMarc suggested Danny may be a better thief than him and challenges Danny to steal the [[Imperial Coronation (Faberg\u00e9 egg)|Imperial Coronation Faberg\u00e9 Egg]]. If Danny and his crew win, Toulour will pay off the debt to Benedict.\n\nThe crew begin to plan an elaborate heist to swap the egg for a [[Holography|holographic recreation]], but Toulour gives the camera recordings from his villa to Lahiri, who deduces that they want to steal the egg through an intercepted phone call to Rusty. She then captures all of the crew except Linus, Tarr, Turk, and Saul. Linus comes up with a second plan involving Danny's wife, Tess, posing as a pregnant [[Julia Roberts]] in order to get close to the egg and swap it. They are foiled by Lahiri and a coincidentally present [[Bruce Willis]], and the rest of the group members are captured. Lahiri is told that they are to be [[extradition|extradited]] to the U.S., while Linus is chosen first to be interrogated by the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] agent assigned to collect them. It turns out that she is his mother, who organizes the release of the whole gang. She points out to Lahiri that she will face consequences for forging a signature on a Europol form to obtain the necessary arrest warrants for Ocean's gang.\n\nSome time later, Danny and Tess return to Toulour's villa, where Toulour reveals his glee at their failure. He explains that he stole the egg at night using his agility and dancing skills to evade the museum's heavy security. Toulour's celebration is short-lived when Danny reveals that his group stole the real egg while it was in transit to the museum, and Toulour realizes they were tipped off by LeMarc. A flashback reveals that Danny and Rusty had met LeMarc earlier when he revealed his [[confidence trick]] intended to humiliate Toulour and, at the same time, restore to himself the Faberg\u00e9 egg that he had stolen years ago but returned following his wife's wishes. Toulour is forced to admit that Danny won the bet and gives him the money for the debt to Benedict.\n\nThe crew pay back Benedict and promise not to perform any more heists in his casinos, as Toulour is seen in the background spying on Benedict. Rusty takes Lahiri to a safe house that he claims has been lent to him by LeMarc. There, she is reunited with her father, who is revealed to be the man she has been pursuing for years: LeMarc.\n\n==Cast==\n{{main|List of Ocean's characters}}\n\n===The Twelve===\n{{cast list|\n* [[George Clooney]] as [[Danny Ocean (character)|Danny Ocean]], an ex-con who leads his group in a heist across Europe\n* [[Brad Pitt]] as Robert \"Rusty\" Ryan, Danny's friend and second-in-command\n* [[Matt Damon]] as Linus Caldwell, a known pickpocket\n* [[Bernie Mac]] as Frank Catton, an ex-[[croupier]]\n* [[Elliott Gould]] as Reuben Tishkoff, a wealthy friend of Danny\n* [[Casey Affleck]] as Virgil Malloy, an expert mechanic\n* [[Scott Caan]] as Turk Malloy, an expert mechanic and the brother of Virgil\n* [[Eddie Jemison]] as Livingston Dell, a surveillance expert\n* [[Don Cheadle]] as Basher Tarr, an explosives expert\n* [[Shaobo Qin]] as \"The Amazing\" Yen, an acrobat\n* [[Carl Reiner]] as Saul Bloom, an elderly con man\n* [[Julia Roberts]] as Tess Ocean, the wife of Danny\n** Roberts also portrays herself in the film in a scene where Tess is impersonating Julia Roberts as part of the con and her character is talking on the phone with her real self.\n}}\n\n===Others===\n{{cast list|\n* [[Catherine Zeta-Jones]] as Isabel Lahiri, a Europol detective\n* [[Andy Garc\u00eda]] as Terry Benedict\n* [[Vincent Cassel]] as Baron Fran\u00e7ois Toulour/The Night Fox, a master thief\n* [[Albert Finney]] as Gaspar LeMarc (uncredited), a former master thief and the mentor of Toulour\n* [[Eddie Izzard]] as Roman Nagel, a master thief whom Danny knows\n* [[Bruce Willis]] as Himself\n* [[Jeroen Krabb\u00e9]] as Van Der Woude\n* [[Cherry Jones]] as Molly Star/Mrs. Caldwell, the mother of Linus\n* [[Robbie Coltrane]] as Matsui, an informant with connections with Danny\n* [[Topher Grace]] as Himself\n* [[Candice Azzara]] as Saul Bloom's Girlfriend\n* [[Jerry Weintraub]] as Denny Shields (uncredited)\n* [[Jared Harris]] as Basher's Engineer\n}}\n\n==Production==\nThe script was reworked when [[Julia Roberts]] learned she was pregnant with twins.<ref>{{cite web|title=OCEANS 12 - Production notes - Twelve Is The New Eleven|url=http://www.cinemareview.com/production.asp?prodid=2805|publisher=CinemaReview.com|access-date=December 1, 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe film was shot in 2004 in [[Atlantic City, New Jersey]], [[St. Petersburg, Florida]] and in [[Las Vegas]] at the [[Bellagio (resort and casino)|Bellagio Hotel]].
