The film follows three women{{mdash}}Carly (Diaz), Kate (Mann), and Amber (Upton){{mdash}}who are all romantically involved with the same man (Coster-Waldau). After finding out about each other, the trio take their revenge on him.\n\nDevelopment of ''The Other Woman'' began in January 2012, when [[20th Century Fox]] hired Stack to write the script, based on the original idea from 1996 comedy ''[[The First Wives Club]]''. Casting was done between November 2012 and June 2013. Filming began on April 29, 2013, in locations including [[Manhattan]], [[Long Island]], [[the Hamptons]], Dockers Waterside Restaurant on Dune Road in [[Quogue]], and [[the Bahamas]], and it concluded on August 27 that year. [[Aaron Zigman]] composed the score and LBI Productions produced the film. The film was released on April 25, 2014, in the United States, and distributed worldwide by [[20th Century Fox]]. The film received mostly negative reviews from critics, but was a box office success, grossing $196.7 million worldwide.\n\n==Plot==\nCarly Whitten ([[Cameron Diaz]]), a New York [[lawyer|attorney]], has started a relationship with Mark King ([[Nikolaj Coster-Waldau]]), a handsome and charismatic [[Businessperson|businessman]], with whom she has been having sex for two months. Carly, planning to introduce Mark to her father Frank ([[Don Johnson]]), is upset he has to go out of town because of a \"flood\" at his Connecticut home, missing their dinner. Her father encourages her to go to his house anyway.\n\nCarly dresses up in a sexy [[plumber]]'s outfit and heads to Mark's house to seduce him. However, she is horrified to be met at the door by Mark's wife Kate ([[Leslie Mann]]), whom she had assumed to be Mark's [[Housekeeper (domestic worker)|housekeeper]]. Thrown for a loop by this revelation, Carly accidentally breaks one of Kate's garden urns. Making up a weak excuse as to why she is there, she staggers away, embarrassed and in shock.\n\nThe next day, Kate shows up at Carly's law firm, having found her contact details in Mark's phone book. Carly admits to Kate that Mark has been cheating on her, but promises the panicked Kate she had no idea Mark was married. Initially annoyed by her constant presence at her apartment or work, Carly begins to warm up to Kate after a wild sleepover and a boozy heart-to-heart. Kate discovers that Mark is seeing yet another woman, who she thinks is Carly secretly continuing her previous relationship with Mark. Confronting Carly about this, they argue before realizing that Mark is seeing a third woman as both Carly and Kate have been refusing sex with him.\n\nCarly and Kate follow Mark to [[the Hamptons]], where they stay at the house of Kate's brother Phil ([[Taylor Kinney]]), who is immediately attracted to Carly. The duo spies on Mark and find him with his mistress Amber ([[Kate Upton]]), a beautiful swimsuit supermodel, on the beach. When Mark leaves for the gym, they inform Amber that Mark has been cheating on all of them.\n\nAll three women decide to get revenge on him together. Kate spikes his smoothies with estrogen pills to swell his nipples, has their dog licking his toothbrush before soaking it in their toilet, and adds hair-removal cream to his shampoo. Carly spikes his water with a laxative to give him heavy diarrhea. Amber uses an ugly drag queen sexual partner against him.\n\nWhile carrying out the various pranks, they discover Mark has been embezzling money from various startup companies his workplace helps to develop. Meanwhile, Carly begins to connect romantically and feel a bond with Phil. The women's camaraderie begins to fall apart when Kate finds herself still in love with Mark after caving in and having sex with him. Carly exposes Mark's fraud before texting him, upsetting Kate and Amber.\n\nLater, Mark goes to the Bahamas on a supposed business trip and Kate decides to follow and expose him. When she arrives she is surprised to find Carly and Amber waiting for her. They explain that Mark has set up Kate as the owner of the companies he defrauded, which, if his fraud is discovered, would result in Kate going to prison rather than him. She also finds out he has been seeing yet another woman, someone he has met on this trip. This, and the possibility of her facing prison, motivates her to take action, with the help of Carly's legal expertise. Amber confides to Carly that she is seeing someone else too.\n\nWhen Mark returns from the trip, he visits Carly at her office. He is locked in a conference room by her assistant and friend Lydia ([[Nicki Minaj]]) and is stunned to see his wife, his girlfriend, and his summer fling sitting there together. They proceed to confront him with his infidelities and embezzlement. With Carly as her attorney, Kate presents divorce papers and a list of their assets. She reveals how she, named [[Chief executive officer|CEO]] by Mark, has returned all of his embezzled money to the companies from which he stole it. So, while they are both saved from jail time, Mark is left bankrupt, much to his shock and hysterical outrage. Mark's former business partner Nick ([[David Thornton (actor)|David Thornton]]) then arrives and acknowledges Kate's work while firing him.\n\nEveryone watches in amusement as a furious Mark accidentally smashes into an empty room's glass paneling, drastically hurting his nose and ripping his coat, as he begins to look destitute. He exits to find his car being towed for being near the red zone before receiving a departing punch in the face from Frank who quotes \"next time, call a plumber\".\n\nSome time later, Carly, Kate, and Amber happily toast to their friendship, promising to never sleep with the same guy ever again.\n\nA postscript states that Carly and Phil have fallen in love and are now expecting a child. Kate has taken over Mark's job with Nick and becomes CEO of several successful companies, making big profits under her honest leadership. It is revealed Frank was the guy Amber had started seeing and the two are traveling the world together with Carly refusing to call her \"mom\".\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Leslie Mann]] as Kate Hampton, a
