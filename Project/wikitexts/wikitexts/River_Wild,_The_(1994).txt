Gail, a history teacher and former river guide, is taking their son, Roarke on a rafting trip down the [[Salmon River (Idaho)|Salmon River]] in Idaho, along with their dog, Maggie. Their daughter, Willa is staying behind with Gail's parents in Idaho. Tom, who had remained in Boston, unexpectedly joins them at the last minute. As they are setting off, they meet three other rafters, Wade, Terry, and Frank, who appear to be friendly.\n\nThe Hartmans catch up with the trio during a day break, and notice that Frank is no longer with Wade and Terry. They explain that he hiked out after an argument. Unfortunately, he was their guide, and Wade and Terry lack any rafting experience. Gail offers to guide them down the rest of the river. Before getting back on the water, Maggie wanders off and becomes curious about something in the brush farther up the canyon. Tom fetches her before she uncovers it, and they return to the raft.\n\nAfter a day's rafting, they make camp for the night, but Tom continues working on his [[Rendering (computer graphics)|architectural project]], disappointing Roarke, who feels neglected. They are joined by Wade and Terry, who help celebrate Roarke's birthday that night. After Wade begins acting suspiciously, Gail agrees with Tom that they should part ways with him and Terry. Their plans are upended when Wade and Terry shove off first with Roarke aboard their raft. Wade, showing off to Roarke, reveals they have a gun. During a rest stop, Gail and Tom attempt to take off with Roarke before Wade and Terry notice. That fails, and Wade pulls the gun on Tom. As they struggle, Maggie runs off into the bushes. Gail then realizes that Wade and Terry committed a recently reported robbery and have killed Frank.\n\nThe Hartmans are forced down the river at gunpoint before setting up camp for the night. During the night, Tom tries and fails to wrestle the gun away from Terry. Tom runs into the river with Wade chasing him, but he escapes. Wade lies, telling Gail and Roarke that Tom is dead. The next day they run into Johnny, who knows that Gail intends to run the Gauntlet, and warns her not to try. Wade shoots him and throws his body into the rapids.\n\nUnbeknownst to anyone, Tom, who finds Maggie, is racing on foot along the canyon rim to get ahead of the raft. After a harrowing ride, the group makes it through the Gauntlet. Tom reappears, and flips the raft. As he struggles with Terry, Gail is able to get the gun. She shoots and kills Wade while Tom subdues Terry. A helicopter with rangers aboard arrives, and they arrest Terry. Gail and Tom share a kiss by the rapids. The film ends with the Hartmans in embrace.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=18em}}\n* [[Meryl Streep]] as Gail Hartman\n* [[Kevin Bacon]] as Wade\n* [[David Strathairn]] as Tom Hartman\n* [[Joseph Mazzello]] as Roarke Hartman\n* [[John C.

They also began to seek permits from the forest service and permission from private landowners to film near the falls and nearby West Glacier. Other than Montana for locations, the studio then began to scout the areas in Washington, Oregon, Idaho and Wyoming. Before filming began, the crew spent two weeks doing research and development on whitewater rafting.\n\nPrincipal photography began on August 4, 1993. Many of the film's whitewater scenes were filmed on the Kootenai River.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web |last=Galbraith |first=Jane |date=1993-11-07 |title=ON LOCATION : Does White Water Become Her? |url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1993-11-07-ca-54043-story.html |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211029171356/https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1993-11-07-ca-54043-story.html |archive-date=2021-10-29 |access-date=2022-07-13 |website=[[Los Angeles Times]] |language=en-US}}</ref> Other scenes were filmed on the Ruby Horsethief section of the [[Colorado River]], the [[Rogue River (Oregon)|Rogue River]] in [[Oregon|Southern Oregon]], and the Middle Fork of the [[Flathead River]]. The locations necessitated specialized whitewater river professionals to perform the river stunts and provide the needed safety for Streep and other cast members.<ref name=\":0\" /> Streep did several of her own stunts in the film on the milder river sections. The major whitewater stunts were performed by expert professional river guide Kelley Kalafatich who was hired as Streep's stunt double for the movie.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThere was a scare at the end of one day of filming when Hanson asked Streep to shoot one more scene, to which she objected because of her exhaustion. However, she decided to attempt it, and weak from fatigue, was swept off the raft into the river and was in danger of drowning; she did not drown because of her [[personal flotation device]] and the river rescue team. Afterwards she said to Hanson, \"In the future, when I say I can't do something, I think you should believe me,\" to which he agreed.<ref>{{cite news|title=10 Iconic Movie Scenes That Nearly Killed Their Stars: 2.
