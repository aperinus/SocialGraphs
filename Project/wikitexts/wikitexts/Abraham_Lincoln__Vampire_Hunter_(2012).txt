[[Benjamin Walker (actor)|Benjamin Walker]] stars as Abraham Lincoln with supporting roles by [[Dominic Cooper]], [[Anthony Mackie]], [[Mary Elizabeth Winstead]], [[Rufus Sewell]], and [[Marton Csokas]].\n\nThe film was produced by [[Tim Burton]], Bekmambetov, and [[Jim Lemley]], with [[Simon Kinberg]] as an executive producer. Filming began in [[Louisiana]] in March 2011 and the film was released in [[Real D 3D]] on June 20, 2012 in the United Kingdom and June 22, 2012 in the United States. The film received mixed reviews, with critics praising the visual style, action sequences, originality, Walker's performance and [[Henry Jackman]]'s musical score, but criticism was aimed at its screenplay, the overly serious and inconsistent tone, overuse of [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]], and pacing. The film also failed to meet expectations at the box office, grossing $116 million worldwide against the budget of $69-$99 million.\n\n==Plot==\n<!--\nPLEASE DO NOT add more detail to this summary, but instead adjust what is already present.

There, Lincoln befriends a young [[African American]] boy, [[William Henry Johnson (valet)|William Johnson]],<ref name=\"Today\">{{cite web|url=https://www.today.com/news/anthony-mackie-stakes-claim-role-abraham-lincoln-vampire-hunter-837563|title=Anthony Mackie stakes claim to role in 'Abraham Lincoln, Vampire Hunter'|last=Gael Fashingbauer Cooper and Randee Dawn|date=June 20, 2012|website=today.com|publisher=[[Today (American TV program)]]|access-date=January 12, 2021|quote=\"Mackie said his character, onetime slave Will Johnson, is based on a real individual who was freed and employed by the president.\"}}</ref> and intervenes when he sees Johnson being beaten by a slaver. Because of his son's actions, Thomas is fired. That night, Lincoln sees Barts break into his house and attack Nancy. She falls ill the following day, and dies shortly afterwards. Thomas tells Lincoln that Barts poisoned Nancy.\n\nNine years later, Lincoln decides to get revenge against Barts. He attacks Barts at the docks, but Barts, who is actually a [[vampire]], overpowers him. However, before Barts can kill him, Lincoln is rescued by Henry Sturgess. Sturgess explains that vampires exist, and offers to teach Lincoln to be a vampire hunter. Lincoln accepts and, after a decade of training, travels to [[Springfield, Illinois]]. During his training, Sturgess tells Lincoln that the vampires in America descend from Adam, a powerful vampire who owns a plantation in [[New Orleans]] with his sister, Vadoma. Sturgess also tells Lincoln of the vampires' weakness, [[silver]], and presents him with a silver pocket watch.\n\nIn Springfield, Lincoln befriends shopkeeper [[Joshua Fry Speed|Joshua Speed]], and meets [[Mary Todd Lincoln|Mary Todd]]. Though Sturgess warned him not to form any close relationships, Lincoln develops romantic feelings for Mary. While in Springfield, Lincoln hunts vampires named in letters by Sturgess.\n\nLincoln successfully finds and defeats Barts. Before dying, Barts reveals that Sturgess is also a vampire. Lincoln confronts Sturgess, who reveals that, several years ago, he was attacked and bitten by Adam. Because Sturgess' soul was impure, he became a vampire, and that prevented him from harming Adam or any other vampire (since \"Only the living can kill the dead\"). Sturgess has since been training vampire hunters, hoping to destroy Adam.\n\nDisappointed, Lincoln decides to abandon his mission. However, Adam learns of his activities and kidnaps Johnson to lure Lincoln into a trap at his plantation. Adam captures Lincoln and tries to recruit him, revealing his plans to turn the United States into a nation of the undead. Speed rescues his friends, and they escape to [[Ohio]].\n\nLincoln marries Mary Todd and begins his political career, campaigning to abolish slavery. Sturgess warns Lincoln that the slave trade keeps vampires under control, as vampires use slaves for food, and if Lincoln interferes, the vampires will retaliate. After Lincoln's election as [[President of the United States of America]], he moves to the [[White House]] with Mary, where they have a son, [[William Wallace Lincoln]].  William is later bitten by Vadoma and dies.\n\nConfederate President [[Jefferson Davis]] convinces Adam to deploy his vampires on the front lines. Lincoln orders the confiscation of all the silverware in the area and has it melted to produce silver weapons. Speed, supposedly believing that Lincoln is tearing the nation apart, defects and informs Adam that Lincoln will transport the silver by train.\n\nOn the train, Adam and Vadoma, who have set fire to an upcoming [[Trestle bridge|trestle]], attack Lincoln, Sturgess, and Johnson. During the fight, in which Speed is killed, Adam learns that the train holds only rocks. Lincoln reveals that Speed's betrayal was a ruse to lure Adam into a trap. Lincoln uses his watch to stab Adam, killing him, and the three escape the train before the burning trestle beneath it collapses. Meanwhile, Mary and the ex-slaves have transported the silver to Gettysburg through the [[Underground Railroad]].\n\nThe now leaderless Confederate vampires stage a final, massive [[Pickett's Charge|assault]] and are met head-on by the Union. Armed with their silver weapons, the Union soldiers destroy the vampires and eventually win the war. Before the battle, Mary recognizes Vadoma and avenges her son by shooting Vadoma in the head with a silver necklace bearing the sword of one of William's toy soldiers.\n\nNearly two years later, on [[Assassination of Abraham Lincoln|April 14, 1865]], Sturgess tells Lincoln that the remaining vampires have fled the country. Sturgess tries to convince Lincoln to allow him to turn Lincoln into a vampire, so that he can become immortal and continue to fight vampires, but Lincoln declines.\n\nIn modern times, Sturgess approaches a man at a bar in [[Washington, D.C.]], just as he once did Abraham. Upon slapping his back, a gun falls to the floor.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Benjamin Walker (actor)|Benjamin Walker]], who plays the titular role in this film, gets into character before touring the {{USS|Abraham Lincoln|CVN-72|6}}.]]\n{{div col}}\n* [[Benjamin Walker (actor)|Benjamin Walker]] as [[Abraham Lincoln]], a secret vampire hunter, who serves as the [[List of presidents of the United States|16th President of the United States]].<ref name=\"ben\" />\n** Lux Haney-Jardine as Young Abraham Lincoln\n* [[Dominic Cooper]] as Henry Sturgess, Lincoln's mentor in vampire hunting, a former vampire hunter, and a vampire who lost his wife and humanity to vampires.\n* [[Anthony Mackie]] as [[William Henry Johnson (valet)|Will Johnson]], Lincoln's earliest and closest friend.<ref>{{cite news |last=Zeitchik |first=Steven |url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/movies/2011/03/abraham-lincoln-vampire-hunter-anthony-mackie-movie.html |title='Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter' star Anthony Mackie: Our movie will be educational |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=March 2, 2011}}</ref>\n** Curtis Harris as Young Will\n* [[Mary Elizabeth Winstead]] as [[Mary Todd Lincoln]], Lincoln's wife.<ref name=\"mary\" />\n* [[Rufus Sewell]] as Adam, the 5,000-year-old leader of an order of vampires.<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Abrams |first=Rachel |url=https://variety.com/article/VR1118035341 |title=Rufus Sewell to play villain in 'Vampire Hunter' |magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date=April 12, 2011}}</ref>\n* [[Marton Csokas]] as Jack Barts, a plantation owner and the vampire who killed Lincoln's mother.\n* [[Jimmi Simpson]] as [[Joshua Fry Speed|Joshua Speed]], Lincoln's friend and assistant.<ref name=\"jimmi\" />\n* [[Joseph Mawle]] as [[Thomas Lincoln]], Lincoln's father.\n* [[Robin McLeavy]] as [[Nancy Lincoln]], Lincoln's mother.<ref name=\"tudyk\" />\n* [[Erin Wasson]] as Vadoma, Adam's sister.\n* [[John Rothman]] as [[Jefferson Davis]]\n* Cameron M.
