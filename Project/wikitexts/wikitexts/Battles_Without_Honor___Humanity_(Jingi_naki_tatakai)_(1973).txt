The screenplay by [[Kazuo Kasahara]] adapts a series of newspaper articles by journalist [[K\u014dichi Iiboshi]], that were rewrites of a manuscript originally written by real-life [[yakuza]] K\u014dz\u014d Min\u014d. It is the first film in [[Battles Without Honor and Humanity|a five-part series]] that Fukasaku made in a span of just two years.\n\nThe violent, documentary-like film chronicles the underworld tribulations of Shozo Hirono ([[Bunta Sugawara]]), a young ex-soldier and street thug-turned yakuza in post-war [[Hiroshima Prefecture]]. Starting in the open-air [[black market]]s of bombed-out Hiroshima in 1946, the film spans a period of more than ten years. The plot consists of a changing of the guard of new families and organizations with the same feuds and people, punctuated by the gritty violence.\n\n''Battles Without Honor and Humanity'' won the 1974 ''[[Kinema Junpo]]'' Awards for Best Film, Best Actor (Bunta Sugawara) and Best Screenplay (Kazuo Kasahara). In 2009, the magazine named it fifth on a list of the Top 10 Japanese Films of All Time. Due to the series' commercial and critical popularity it was followed by another three-part series, ''New Battles Without Honor and Humanity''. The film is often called the \"Japanese ''[[The Godfather|Godfather]]''\"<ref>{{cite web|first=Fernando F.|last=Croce|url=http://www.cinepassion.org/Reviews/b/BattlesHonorHumanity.html|title=Battles Without Honor and Humanity (Japan, 1973): (Jingi Naki Tatakai)|access-date=2009-05-16|publisher=cinepassion.org|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081122002439/http://cinepassion.org/Reviews/b/BattlesHonorHumanity.html|archive-date=November 22, 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref> and marks a departure from traditional yakuza movies which had, for the most part, been tales of [[chivalry]] set in pre-war Japan. The overall tone of the series is bleak, violent and chaotic, expressing the futility of the struggles between yakuza families. In the western market it is also known under the titles ''Tarnished Code of Yakuza'' (Australia), ''War Without a Code'', and ''The Yakuza Papers''.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1946 [[Kure]], [[World War II|war]] veteran Shozo Hirono is sent to prison after shooting a sword-wielding yakuza who assaulted his friend. He befriends and becomes sworn brothers with another prisoner, Doi Family member Hiroshi Wakasugi, who arranges for Yoshio Yamamori, Patriarch of the Yamamori Family, to bribe the prison warden and get him released. Hirono and his gang of fellow ex-soldiers - Tetsuya Sakai, Seiichi Kanbara, Uichi Shinkai, Masakichi Makihara, and Shuji Yano - then join the Yamamori Family by swearing loyalty to the boss and to each other. Wakasugi's boss, Patriarch Doi, serves as an official witness to the ceremony, along with Kenichi Okubo, Patriarch of the powerful Okubo Family.\n\nThree years later, in 1949, Hirono gets into a fight with a man named Toru Ueda at a gambling den. Since Ueda is a blood relative of Okubo's, Hirono commits ''[[yubitsume]]'' in apology to Okubo. Okubo accepts, but asks Yamamori to take Ueda into his family and perform a favor for corrupt politician Shigeto Nakahara by eliminating a vote for his rival Shoichi Kanamaru, who is supported by the Doi Family in a political dispute over allotment of public resources. Sakai kidnaps one of Kanamaru's allies before the vote, allowing Nakahara's side to win, and goes into hiding afterwards. Doi finds out due to Kanbara bragging about it while drinking and beats him severely, then goes after Yamamori. However, out of loyalty to Hirono, Wakasugi stops Doi from killing Yamamori and a deal is brokered: Wakasugi will become a guest member of the Yamamori Family while Kanbara takes his place in the Doi Family.\n\nSix months later, Doi starts moving against Yamamori and prepares to form an alliance with the Kaito Family from [[Hiroshima City]]. With the other members unwilling to act and Wakasugi forbidden by yakuza traditions to betray his boss, Hirono volunteers to handle the matter after Yamamori agrees to promote him. Hirono successfully assassinates Doi while he's coming out of a meeting with the Kaito Family and escapes. While in hiding, Hirono is visited by Kanbara, who claims Yamamori has a plan to sneak him out of the city. However, it turns out to be a set-up and Hirono, finding himself abandoned by Yamamori and hunted by the Doi Family, turns himself in for murdering Doi. Wakasugi murders Kanbara in revenge, but an anonymous tip to the police (provided by Yamamori) leads them to his girlfriend's house and he is killed trying to escape.\n\nWith the [[Korean War]] raging in the 1950s, the Yamamori Family thrives thanks to war contracts and expands in the immediate years, but internal strife begins when members start dealing [[philopon]] due to the high kickbacks the boss takes off their earnings. Sakai and Shinkai, who are now high-ranking officers in the family, feud when Shinkai's surbordinate, Toshio Arita, deals against Yamamori's orders. Sakai, recognizing that the patriarch's take is too high, offers a plan to have each family member become self-sustaining and limit the kickbacks, which only Shinkai and Yano vote against. Shinkai begins plotting with the surviving Doi Family members to kill Sakai. When it's revealed that Yamamori is selling the drugs he confiscates from the other members for personal profit, Sakai and Ueda threaten him and reveal their intention to take over the family. Yamamori has Arita kill Ueda in a barbershop and war breaks out between the two sides. The conflict ends quickly: Shinkai's men and the Doi Family members are murdered by Sakai's associates, Arita shoots a police officer who tries to arrest him and gets a life sentence, and Shinkai is stabbed to death before he can board a train to escape the city.\n\nHirono is then paroled due to a [[commutation of sentence]] and learns about the strife in the Yamamori Family. He goes to see Sakai, asking his old friend to make peace with Yamamori. Instead, Sakai forces Yamamori to retire, crowns himself the family's new patriarch, forms an investment company with Yamamori's money, and starts negotiating with the Kaito Family. When Makihara informs Sakai that Yano is making a secret trip to persuade the Kaito Family to end the negotiations, Sakai has him gunned down when he arrives. Makihara then contacts Hirono to join him on the supposedly retired Yamamori's side; however, Hirono refuses and instead announces he is breaking off his pledge to Yamamori and leaving his family. He goes to see Sakai and the two men vow to kill each other. After Sakai allows him to leave peacefully, Hirono witnesses his murder at the hands of Makihara's hitmen. At Sakai's funeral, which has Makihara and Yamamori in attendance, Hirono arrives with a gun, shoots up the funeral display, and threatens Yamamori before storming off.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Bunta Sugawara]] as Shozo Hirono\n*[[Hiroki Matsukata]] as Tetsuya Sakai\n*[[Nobuo Kaneko]] as Patriarch Yoshio Yamamori\n*[[Tatsuo Umemiya]] as Hiroshi Wakasugi\n*[[Kunie Tanaka]] as Masakichi Makihara\n*[[Goro Ibuki]] as Toru Ueda\n*Shinichiro Mikami as Uichi Shinkai\n*[[Tamio Kawaji]] as Seiichi Kanbara\n*[[Tsunehiko Watase]] as Toshio Arita\n*Harumi Sone as Shuji Yano\n*Keiji Takamiya as Shinichi Yamagata\n*Toshie Kimura as Rika Yamamori\n*Asao Uchida as Patriarch Kenichi Okubo\n*Hiroshi Nawa as Patriarch Kiyoshi Doi\n* Eiko Nakamura as Suzue Kunihiro\n*[[Mayumi Nagisa]] as Akiko Shinjo\n*Kinji Nakamura as Shigeto Nakahara\n*[[Takuzo Kawatani]] as an unnamed Doi family member\n\n==Production==\n''Battles Without Honor and Humanity'' adapts a series of articles by journalist [[K\u014dichi Iiboshi]] that ran in {{nihongo|''Weekly Sankei''|\u9031\u520a\u30b5\u30f3\u30b1\u30a4|Sh\u016bkan Sankei}},<ref name=\"booklet\">{{cite book|last=Kasahara |first=Kazuo |date=2015 |orig-year=1974 |chapter=Jitsuroku: My Personal Account of the Screenplay - The 300 Days of Battles Without Honor and Humanity |title=Battles Without Honor and Humanity Dual Format Blu-ray & DVD |translator-last=Akita |translator-first=Sho |publisher=[[Arrow Films]]}}</ref> that were rewrites of a manuscript originally written by real-life yakuza K\u014dz\u014d Min\u014d while he was incarcerated in [[Abashiri Prison]].<ref name = \"Outlaw\">{{cite book |last = D.|first = Chris|authorlink = Chris D.|title = Outlaw Masters of Japanese Film|publisher = I.B.

He said that six months before the movie was released, he was on the cover of ''Shukan Sunday'' with Tatsuo Umemiya and read this issue that also contained the first installment of the series while on the [[Shinkansen]]. Upon arriving in Kyoto he gave it to Toei producer Koji Shundo and told him to read it. Days later, after Shundo still had not done so, Sugawara bought another copy and insisted again. The actor asked Shundo to cast him in an adaptation, with Goro Kusakabe producing and Kinji Fukasaku directing.<ref name=\"Sugawara\">{{cite book |last1=Schilling |first1=Mark |authorlink=Mark Schilling |title=The Yakuza Movie Book : A Guide to Japanese Gangster Films |publisher=[[Stone Bridge Press]] |year=2003 |pages=135\u2013136 |isbn=1-880656-76-0 |url=http://www.stonebridge.com/YAKUZA/yakuza.html |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071017060352/http://stonebridge.com/YAKUZA/yakuza.html |archive-date=2007-10-17 }}</ref>\n\n===Screenplay===\n[[Kazuo Kasahara]] received the order for the screenplay on September 1, 1972. He revealed that while Toei had gotten the rights to adapt the series from Iiboshi and ''Weekly Sankei'', it seemed they had not bothered to ask Min\u014d. Because the journals were written objectively and therefore easy to read, Kasahara had to flesh them out with details to make it dramatic. Despite Toei advising against it, Kasahara went to Kure with producer Goro Kusakabe on September 29 to meet Min\u014d.<ref name=\"booklet\"/>\n\nWhen Kasahara and Kusakabe first asked Min\u014d for permission to adapt his story, he declined not wanting to receive further scorn from his fellow gang members, which he had already received for exposing the inner workings of the lifestyle.<ref name=\"YakuzaMovieGuide\">{{cite book |last1=Schilling |first1=Mark |title=The Yakuza Movie Book : A Guide to Japanese Gangster Films |publisher=[[Stone Bridge Press]] |year=2003 |pages=33\u201335 |isbn=1-880656-76-0 |url=http://www.stonebridge.com/YAKUZA/yakuza.html |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071017060352/http://stonebridge.com/YAKUZA/yakuza.html |archive-date=2007-10-17 }}</ref> However, after learning that Min\u014d and Kasahara both served at the Otake naval officer school in Hiroshima, Min\u014d agreed to help clarify details about the journals but still did not approve a film adaptation.<ref name=\"booklet\"/>\n\nWhen he returned to Tokyo, Kasahara told Toei he could work with the incidents in Kure, but not the events that followed in Hiroshima because they were too complicated and they agreed. Although Min\u014d had to be the protagonist, Kasahara found it difficult to create a character based on the notes he had taken and so developed the story around yakuza [[underboss]] Tetsuhiko Sasaki, who rebelled against [[Kyosei-kai]] leader Tatsuo Yamamura and was killed. He envisioned Bunta Sugawara portraying the character (he later learned Sugawara had already been cast in the role), but said the day before shooting Sugawara was instead cast as Hirono (who is based on Min\u014d) and Hiroki Matsukata took over as Sakai (Sasaki).<ref name=\"booklet\"/>\n\nKasahara used the 1936 film ''[[La belle \u00e9quipe]]'' as a guide for the action in ''Battles Without Honor and Humanity''. The writer had concerns over organizing the real facts to make stories, as one could not fit everything into an action movie, and how close to stick to reality, settling on a mix of reality and human drama. He deleted all the scenes with Hirono (Min\u014d) interacting with a female heroine, as it was the only request of Min\u014d, who Kasahara felt had given his unspoken approval by now. This is the reason the film ends abruptly. The screenplay took Kasahara 69 days to write.<ref name=\"booklet\"/>\n\n===Filming===\nWhen Shundo selected Fukasaku to direct he received backlash from his Toei colleagues, who felt the director could not make the film \"interesting\" or \"commercial\" enough. Shundo himself did not like Fukasaku's earlier films, stating that he made them for his own enjoyment only, but changed his mind after seeing 1972's ''[[Street Mobster]]''.<ref name=\"YakuzaMovieGuide\"/> Kasahara was against the selection of Fukasaku.<ref name=\"booklet\"/> Fukasaku biographer Sadao Yamane explained the two had worked together previously and fought over a story Fukasaku disliked, although the two eventually worked over it, the director left the project due to ill health. However, when Fukasaku read the ''Battles Without Honor and Humanity'' script he said he would not change a thing and the film was green lit.<ref>{{cite AV media |year=2004 |chapter=Kantoku: Remembering the Director |title=The Yakuza Papers: Battles Without Honor and Humanity Complete Boxed Set - Special Features |medium=DVD |minutes=12:30 |publisher=Home Vision Entertainment}}</ref> Filming began in November 1972.<ref name=\"shincho\">{{cite web |title=7\u30018\u79d2\u306e\u30d5\u30a3\u30eb\u30e0\u3092\u3084\u308b\u304b\u3089\u3001\u60aa\u5f79\u306e\u83ef\u3092\u54b2\u304b\u305b\u3066\u6b7b\u306d\u300d\u4ff3\u512a\u305f\u3061\u306b\u611b\u3055\u308c\u305f\u76e3\u7763\u30fb\u6df1\u4f5c\u6b23\u4e8c\u306e\u4ec1\u7fa9 \u300c\u4ec1\u7fa9\u306a\u304d\u6226\u3044\u300d\u5916\u4f1d\u30083\u3009|url=https://www.dailyshincho.jp/article/2021/12010605/?all=1 |work=[[Shinchosha|Daily Shincho]]|language=Japanese|date=2021-12-01|accessdate=2022-11-05 }}</ref> \n\nSet in post-war Japan, Fukasaku drew on his experiences as a child during [[World War II]] for ''Battles Without Honor and Humanity''. At fifteen he worked with other children in a munitions factory that was regularly bombed. The director recalled \"even though we were friends working together, the only thing we would be thinking of was self-preservation. We would try to get behind each other or beneath dead bodies to avoid the bombs.... I also had to clean up all the dead bodies.... I'm sure those experiences have influenced the way I look at violence.\" The film, noted for its \"extreme violence,\" opens with Japanese soldiers, during America's occupation of their country, stealing food and murdering for a bowl of rice.<ref>{{cite news|title=Kinji Fukasaku, 72; Japanese Director of Edgy, Violent Films|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2003/jan/27/local/me-fukasaku27|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|access-date=2014-08-22}}</ref> Using [[hand-held camera]], [[zoom lens]]es and natural lighting to create a \"gritty, chaotic look,\" the director showed his generation's struggle to survive in the post-war chaos.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Schilling |first1=Mark |title=The Yakuza Movie Book : A Guide to Japanese Gangster Films |publisher=[[Stone Bridge Press]] |year=2003 |pages=214 |isbn=1-880656-76-0 |url=http://www.stonebridge.com/YAKUZA/yakuza.html |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071017060352/http://stonebridge.com/YAKUZA/yakuza.html |archive-date=2007-10-17 }}</ref> The [[shaky camera]] technique has since become a trademark of the director.\n\nToei producer Masao Sato remarked that unusually Fukasaku shot the film in Toei's Kyoto studio, despite being under contract to Toei Tokyo.<ref name=\"Sato\">{{cite AV media |year=2004 |chapter=Jitsuroku: Reinventing a Genre |title=The Yakuza Papers: Battles Without Honor and Humanity Complete Boxed Set - Special Features |medium=DVD |minutes=15:05 |publisher=Home Vision Entertainment}}</ref> Fukasaku's son [[Kenta Fukasaku|Kenta]] said that his father's friend [[Sadao Nakajima]] arranged to have who he considered the best staff at Toei Kyoto work with Fukasaku, which greatly eased the transition.<ref name=\"shincho\"/> Sato also stated that the entire filming process was short, hectic and chaotic, taking only 35 to 40 days.<ref name=\"Sato\"/> Scenes set to be filmed on-location were first rehearsed in studio, before being shot \"guerilla-style\" with hand-held cameras at the actual location and with civilian passersby giving real reactions.<ref name=\"shincho\"/> For example, knowing they would never get permission, the scene where the character Uichi Shinkai is stabbed to death at [[Hiroshima Station]] was actually shot on the platform of [[Kyoto Station]] without permission, before the team left as quickly as possible.<ref name=\"shincho\"/> Upon filming on location in Kure, many yakuza, including those used as models for characters in the film, gathered on set.
