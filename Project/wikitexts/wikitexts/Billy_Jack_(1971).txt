Filming began in [[Prescott, Arizona]], in the fall of 1969, but the movie was not completed until 1971. [[American International Pictures]] pulled out, halting filming. [[20th Century Fox|20th Century-Fox]] came forward and filming eventually resumed but when that studio refused to distribute the film, [[Warner Bros.]] stepped forward.\n\nStill, the film lacked distribution, so Laughlin booked it into theaters himself in 1971.<ref name=\"NYT\" /> The film grossed $10 million in its initial run, but eventually added close to $50 million in its re-release,<ref name=\"Variety\">\"Revival of the fittest a Hollywood tradition\", Leonard Klady, ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'', 11 November 1996, pg 75.</ref> with distribution supervised by Laughlin.\n\n== Plot ==\nBilly Jack is a \"[[mixed-race]]\" [[Navajo people|Navajo]],<ref>{{cite news |author=ICTMN Staff |date=December 17, 2013 |title='Billy Jack' Star Tom Laughlin Dead at 82 |url=http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2013/12/17/billy-jack-star-tom-laughlin-dead-82-152756 |work=[[Indian Country Today Media Network]] |access-date=August 13, 2016 |archive-date=December 24, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224053114/http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2013/12/17/billy-jack-star-tom-laughlin-dead-82-152756 |url-status=live }}</ref> a [[Special Forces (United States Army)|Green Beret]] [[Vietnam War]] [[veteran]], and a [[hapkido]] master.\n\nJack defends the [[hippie]]-themed Freedom School (inspired by [[Prescott College]]) and students from townspeople who do not understand or like the [[counterculture of the 1960s|counterculture]] students. The school is organized by its director, Jean Roberts ([[Delores Taylor]]). One of the troubled youths is a girl named Barbara, who became pregnant and was abused by her father.\n\nA group of children of various races from the school go to town for ice cream and are refused service and then abused and humiliated by Bernard Posner (David Roya), the son of the county's corrupt [[political boss]] Stuart Posner ([[Bert Freed]]), and his gang. This prompts a violent outburst by Billy. Billy goes through a Navajo initiation where he gets bitten purposely by a deadly rattlesnake, so that he would become the blood brother to the snake, which he does survive. Meanwhile, Barbara loses her unborn child, when the horse she was riding stumbles on a rock, causing her to fall off the horse. Following an incident involving Jean, Billy gives Bernard a choice of either receiving a dislocated elbow, or driving his Corvette into the lake; Bernard does the latter. Later, Jean is kidnapped and raped by Bernard, who also murders a Native American student. Billy confronts Bernard, whom he catches in bed with a 13-year-old girl, and sustains a gunshot wound before killing him with a hand strike to the throat. After a climactic shootout with the police and pleading from Jean, Billy Jack surrenders to the authorities in exchange for a decade-long guarantee that the school will be allowed to continue to run with Jean as its head. As Billy is driven away in handcuffs, a large crowd of supporters [[Raised fist|raise their fists]] as a show of defiance and support.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Tom Laughlin]] as Billy Jack\n* [[Delores Taylor]] as Jean Roberts\n* David Roya as Bernard Posner\n* [[Clark Howat]] as Sheriff Cole\n* Victor Izay as Doctor\n* Julie Webb as Barbara\n* Debbie Schock as Kit\n* Teresa Kelly as Carol\n* Lynn Baker as Sarah\n* Stan Rice as Martin\n* John McClure as Dinosaur\n* Susan Foster as Cindy\n* Susan Sosa as Sunshine\n* [[Bert Freed]] as Mr. Stuart Posner\n* [[Kenneth Tobey]] as Deputy Mike\n* [[Howard Hesseman]] as Howard (credited as Don Sturdy)\n* [[Cisse Cameron]] as Miss False Eyelashes (credited as Cissie Colpitts)\n* [[Han Bong-soo]] Fight double for Tom Laughlin\n{{div col end}}\n\n== Box-office and critical reception ==\n''Billy Jack'' holds a 'Fresh' rating of 63% at [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on 16 reviews, with an average grade of 5.37/10.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/billy_jack/ |title=Billy Jack |website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |access-date=July 8, 2019 |archive-date=May 5, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190505033804/https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/billy_jack |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nIn his ''Movie and Video Guide'', film critic [[Leonard Maltin]] gave ''Billy Jack'' 1.5 stars out of 4, writing: 'Seen today, its politics are highly questionable, and its 'message' of peace looks ridiculous, considering the amount of violence in the film.'<ref>{{cite book |editor1-last=Maltin |editor1-first=Leonard |date=1995 |title=Leonard Maltin's 1996 Movie & Video Guide |url=https://archive.org/details/leonardmaltinsmo00newy/page/116 |publisher=Signet |page=[https://archive.org/details/leonardmaltinsmo00newy/page/116 116] |isbn=0-451-18505-6 }}</ref> [[Roger Ebert]] gave the film 2.5 stars out of 4 and also saw the message of the film as self-contradictory, writing: 'I'm also somewhat disturbed by the central theme of the movie.
