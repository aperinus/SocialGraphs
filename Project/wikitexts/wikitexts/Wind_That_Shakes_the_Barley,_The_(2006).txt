Written by long-time Loach collaborator [[Paul Laverty]], this drama tells the fictional story of two [[County Cork]] brothers, Damien O'Donovan ([[Cillian Murphy]]) and Teddy O'Donovan ([[P\u00e1draic Delaney]]), who join the [[Irish Republican Army]] to fight for Irish independence from the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]].\n\nThe film takes its title from [[Robert Dwyer Joyce]]'s \"[[The Wind That Shakes the Barley]]\", a song set during the [[Irish Rebellion of 1798|1798 rebellion in Ireland]] and featured early in the film. The film is heavily influenced by [[Walter Macken]]'s 1964 novel ''The Scorching Wind''.\n\nWidely praised, the film won the [[Palme d'Or]] at the [[2006 Cannes Film Festival]].<ref name=\"festival-cannes.com\">{{cite web |url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/4336504/year/2006.html |title=Festival de Cannes: The Wind That Shakes the Barley |access-date=13 December 2009|work=festival-cannes.com}}</ref> Loach's biggest box office success to date,<ref name=\"UK Film Council\">[http://www.ukfilmcouncil.org.uk/information/news/?p=D424399A0a54317528YjSmACEA19 News from the UK Film Council] UKFilmCouncil.org.uk, 23 April 2007  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070430022822/http://www.ukfilmcouncil.org.uk/information/news/?p=D424399A0a54317528YjSmACEA19 |date=30 April 2007 }}</ref> the film did well around the world and set a record in Ireland as the highest-grossing Irish-made [[independent film]], until surpassed by ''[[The Guard (2011 film)|The Guard]]''.<ref name=\"RT\u00c9 press watch\">[http://www.rte.ie/news/2006/0808/presswatch-business.html \"Loach Film Sets New Money Mark\"] RT\u00c9.ie, 8 August 2006</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n[[County Cork]], Ireland, 1920. Damien O'Donovan is about to leave his native village to practice medicine in a London hospital. Meanwhile, his brother Teddy commands the local [[flying column]] of the [[Irish Republican Army]]. After a [[hurling]] match, Damien witnesses the [[summary execution]] of his friend, Miche\u00e1l \u00d3 S\u00failleabh\u00e1in, by British [[Black and Tans]], for refusing to say his name in English. Although shaken, Damien rebuffs his friends' entreaties to stay in Ireland and join the IRA, saying that the war is unwinnable. As he is leaving town, Damien witnesses the [[British Army]] vainly trying to intimidate a railway personnel for refusing to permit the troops to board. In response, Damien decides to stay and is sworn into Teddy's IRA brigade.\n\nAfter drilling in the mountains, the column raids the village's [[Royal Irish Constabulary]] barracks to acquire revolvers, then uses them to assassinate four [[Auxiliary Division|Auxiliaries]]. In the aftermath, [[Anglo-Irish]] landowner Sir John Hamilton coerces one of his servants, IRA member Chris Reilly, into passing information to the [[British Army]]'s [[Intelligence Corps (United Kingdom)|Intelligence Corps]]. As a result, the entire brigade is arrested. In their cell, Damien meets the train driver, Dan, a union official who shares Damien's [[socialist]] views.\n\nMeanwhile, British officers interrogate Teddy, pulling out his fingernails when he refuses to give them the names of IRA members. Johnny Gogan, a British soldier of Irish descent, helps the prisoners escape, but three are left behind. After the actions of Sir John and Chris are revealed to the IRA's intelligence network, both are taken hostage. As Teddy is still recovering, Damien is temporarily placed in command. News arrives that the three remaining IRA prisoners have been tortured and shot. Simultaneously, the brigade receives orders to \"execute the spies\".\n\nDespite the fact that Chris is a lifelong friend, Damien shoots both him and Sir John. Later, the IRA ambushes and wipes out a convoy of the Auxiliary Division, and in retaliation another detachment of Auxiliaries loots and burns the farmhouse of Damien's sweetheart, [[Cumann na mBan]] member Sin\u00e9ad Sullivan. Sin\u00e9ad is held at gunpoint while her head is roughly shorn, her scalp being wounded in the process. Later, as Damien treats her, a messenger arrives with news of a formal [[ceasefire]] between Britain and the IRA.\n\nAfter the [[Anglo-Irish Treaty]] is signed, the brigade learns that a partitioned Ireland will only be granted [[Dominion]] status within the [[British Empire]]. As a result, the brigade divides over accepting the terms of the Treaty. Teddy and his allies argue that accepting the Treaty will bring peace now while further gains can be made later. Others oppose the Treaty, proposing to continue fighting until a united Irish Republic can be obtained. Dan and Damien further demand the [[collectivisation]] of industry and agriculture. Any other course, declares Dan, will change only \"the accents of the powerful and the colour of the flag\".\n\nSoon the [[Irish Free State]] replaces British rule, and Teddy and his allies begin patrolling in [[National Army (Ireland)|National Army]] uniforms. Meanwhile, Damien and his allies join the [[Anti-Treaty IRA]]. When the [[Battle of Dublin (1922)|Battle of Dublin]] launches the [[Irish Civil War]], the Anti-Treaty column commences [[guerrilla warfare]] against Free State forces. As the violence escalates, Teddy expresses fear that the British will invade if the republicans gain the upper hand. His position is: \"They take one out, we take one back. To hell with the courts.\"\n\nSoon after, Dan is killed and Damien is captured during a raid for arms on an Irish Army barracks commanded by Teddy. Sentenced to [[summary execution|execution]], Damien is held in the same cell where the British Army imprisoned them earlier. Desperate to avoid executing his brother, Teddy pleads with Damien to reveal where the Anti-Treaty IRA is hiding the stolen rifles. In return, Teddy offers Damien full amnesty, a life with Sin\u00e9ad, and the vision of an Ireland where Pro- and Anti-Treaty Irishmen can raise families side by side. Insulted, Damien responds by saying that he will never \"sell out\" the Republic the way Chris Reilly did and Teddy leaves the cell in tears. Damien writes a goodbye letter to Sin\u00e9ad, expressing his love for her, and quoting Dan's words: \"It's easy to know what you're against, quite another to know what you're for\". But he says that he knows what he stands for and is not afraid to die for it and tells Sin\u00e9ad to look after Teddy. At dawn, Damien dies before a [[firing squad]] commanded by a heartbroken yet obstinate Teddy. Teddy delivers Damien's letter to Sin\u00e9ad who is distraught and heartbroken. She attacks Teddy and orders him to leave her land.\n\n==Main cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Cillian Murphy]] \u2013 Damien O'Donovan\n* [[P\u00e1draic Delaney]] \u2013 Teddy O'Donovan\n* [[Liam Cunningham]] \u2013 Dan\n* [[Orla Fitzgerald]] \u2013 Sin\u00e9ad N\u00ed Sh\u00failleabh\u00e1in\n* [[Laurence Barry]] \u2013 Miche\u00e1l \u00d3 S\u00failleabh\u00e1in\n* Mary Murphy \u2013 Bernadette\n* Mary O'Riordan \u2013 Peggy\n* [[Myles Horgan]] \u2013 Rory\n* [[Martin Lucey (actor)|Martin Lucey]] \u2013 Congo\n* [[Roger Allam]] \u2013 Sir John Hamilton\n* [[John Crean]] \u2013 Chris Reilly\n* [[Damien Kearney]] \u2013 Finbar\n* Frank Bourke \u2013 Leo\n* [[Shane Casey (actor)|Shane Casey]] \u2013 Kevin\n* [[M\u00e1irt\u00edn de C\u00f3g\u00e1in]] \u2013 Sean\n* [[William Ruane]] \u2013 Johnny Gogan\n* [[Fiona Lawton]] \u2013 Lily\n* [[Se\u00e1n McGinley]] \u2013 Father Denis\n* Kevin O'Brien \u2013 Tim\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\nThe film stars mostly Irish actors and was made by British director [[Ken Loach]].

Loach commented on this theme in an interview with [[Toronto]]'s ''[[Eye Weekly]]'' (15 March 2007):<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pslweb.org/site/News2?page%3DNewsArticle%26id%3D6647%26news_iv_ctrl%3D1861 |title=Party for Socialism and Liberation (PSL): 'The Wind that Shakes the Barley' examines Ireland's national and class struggle |access-date=2009-02-19 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081115053537/http://www.pslweb.org/site/News2?page=NewsArticle&id=6647&news_iv_ctrl=1861 |archive-date=15 November 2008 |df=dmy }}</ref>\n\n{{blockquote|Every time a colony wants independence, the questions on the agenda are: a) how do you get the imperialists out, and b) what kind of society do you build?
