An [[My Father the Hero (1994 film)|English language remake]] of the movie was made in [[1994 in film|1994]] with G\u00e9rard Depardieu reprising his role. \n\nThe name of the film comes from a famous poem by the French poet [[Victor Hugo]], \"''Mon p\u00e8re, ce h\u00e9ros'',\" published in 1859.\n\n== Plot ==\nAndr\u00e9 ([[G\u00e9rard Depardieu]]), a Frenchman who is divorced from his wife, takes his beautiful 14 year old daughter, V\u00e9ronique ([[Marie Gillain]]), on vacation to a paradise island. She is desperate to appear as a woman and not a girl. In order to impress a local boy, Benjamin (Patrick Mille), she makes up more and more fantastic stories, starting with Andr\u00e9 being her lover \u2013 a sugar Daddy. Andr\u00e9 is desperate to make V\u00e9ronique happy and so plays along with her increasingly elaborate invented stories about her life.\n\n== Production ==\nFilmed on location on [[Mauritius]], the film introduces [[Marie Gillain]] as V\u00e9ronique, as the young V\u00e9ronique. Her portrayal of innocence laced with sensuality earned her a nomination for the [[C\u00e9sar Award]] for Most Promising Actress for her performance. Depardieu, already an established actor, provides a trademark comical performance as Andr\u00e9, the 'eager to please' father who does does the unthinkable for his daughter.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[G\u00e9rard Depardieu]] as Andr\u00e9 Arnel\n* [[Marie Gillain]] as V\u00e9ronique \"V\u00e9ro\" Arnel\n* [[Catherine Jacob (actress)|Catherine Jacob]] as Christelle\n* [[Patrick Mille]] as Benjamin\n* [[Charlotte de Turckheim]] as Irina\n* [[G\u00e9rard H\u00e9rold]] as Patrick\n* [[Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Rangasamy]] as Pablo\n* [[Koomaren Chetty]] as Karim\n* [[Beno\u00eet Allemane]]\n\n== References ==\n<references />\n\n== External links ==\n* {{IMDb title|0102465|Mon p\u00e8re, ce h\u00e9ros}}\n* {{tcmdb title|id=514420}}\n* {{amg movie|145204}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:My Father The Hero (1991 Film)}}\n[[Category:1991 films]]\n[[Category:French romantic comedy-drama films]]\n[[Category:1990s French-language films]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Mauritius]]\n[[Category:Films about vacationing]]\n[[Category:Films directed by G\u00e9rard Lauzier]]\n[[Category:1990s French films]]\n\n\n{{1990s-France-film-stub}}"}]}}}}
