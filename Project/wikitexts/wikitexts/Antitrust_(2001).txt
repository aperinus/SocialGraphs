Milo is offered an attractive programming position with a large paycheck, an almost-unrestrained working environment, and extensive creative control over his work.  After accepting, Hoffman and his girlfriend, Alice Poulson (Forlani), move to NURV headquarters in [[Portland, Oregon]].\n\nDespite development of the [[flagship product]] (Synapse, a worldwide media distribution network) being well on schedule, Hoffman soon becomes suspicious of the excellent [[source code]] that Winston personally provides to him, seemingly when needed most, while refusing to divulge the code's origin.\n\nAfter his best friend and fellow computer programmer, Teddy Chin, is murdered, Hoffman discovers that NURV is stealing the code they need from programmers around the world\u2014including Chin\u2014and then killing them.  NURV not only employs an extensive [[surveillance]] system to observe and steal code, the company has infiltrated the [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department]] and most mainstream media.  Even Hoffman's girlfriend is a [[plant (person)|plant]], an ex-con hired by the company to spy on and manipulate him.\n\nIn a secret NURV database of employee surveillance dossiers, Hoffman discovers highly-sensitive personal information about Lisa Calighan (Cook), a friendly co-worker.  When he says he knows the company has this information about her, she agrees to help him expose NURV's crimes.  Coordinating with Brian Bissel, Hoffman's old start-up friend, they plan to use a local [[public-access television]] station to hijack Synapse and globally broadcast their charges against NURV.  However, Calighan is actually Winston's accomplice and foils Hoffman.\n\nWhen the plan fails, and as Winston prepares to kill Hoffman, a backup plan is put into motion.  Off-screen, Hoffman had previously confronted and convinced Poulson to turn against NURV; she, the fourth member of Skullbocks, and NURV's incorruptible security contractors usurp one of NURV's own work centers\u2014\"Building 21\"\u2014and transmit incriminating evidence with the Synapse code.  Calighan, Winston, and his entourage are arrested for their crimes.  After amicably parting ways with the redeemed Poulson, Hoffman rejoins Skullbocks.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Ryan Phillippe]] as Milo Hoffman\n* [[Rachael Leigh Cook]] as Lisa Calighan\n* [[Claire Forlani]] as Alice Poulson/Rebecca Paul\n* [[Tim Robbins]] as Gary Winston\n* [[Douglas McFerran]] as Bob Shrot\n* [[Richard Roundtree]] as Lyle Barton\n* [[Tygh Runyan]] as Larry Banks\n* [[Yee Jee Tso]] as Teddy Chin\n* [[Nate Dushku]] as Brian Bissel\n* [[Ned Bellamy]] as Phil Grimes\n* [[Tyler Labine]] as Redmond Schmeichel\n* [[Scott Bellis]] as Randy Sheringham\n* [[David Lovgren]] as Danny Solskj\u00e6r\n* Zahf Hajee as Desi\n* [[Jonathon Young]] as Stinky\n* [[Rick Worthy]] as Shrot's Assistant\n* [[Peter Howitt]] as Homeless man\n* Gregor Trpin as Computer Guy\n\n==Allusions==\n{{multiple image\n | footer    = [[Tim Robbins]]'s (left) character drew comparisons to [[Bill Gates]] (right).\n | image1    = TimRobbinsTIFFSept2012.jpg\n | width1    = 198\n | image2    = Bill Gates June 2015.jpg\n | width2    = 176\n}}\n[[Roger Ebert]] found Gary Winston to be a thinly disguised [[pastiche]] of entrepreneur [[Bill Gates]]; so much so that he was \"surprised [the writers] didn't protect against [[defamation|libel]] by having the villain wear a name tag saying, 'Hi!
