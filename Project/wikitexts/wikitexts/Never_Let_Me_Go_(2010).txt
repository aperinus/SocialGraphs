The film was directed by [[Mark Romanek]] from a screenplay by [[Alex Garland]]. ''Never Let Me Go'' is set in an alternative history and centres on Kathy, Ruth and Tommy portrayed by [[Carey Mulligan]], [[Keira Knightley]] and [[Andrew Garfield]], respectively, who become entangled in a [[love triangle]]. [[Principal photography]] began in April 2009. Filming locations included [[Andrew Melville Hall]] and [[Forest School, Walthamstow]].<ref>[https://www.forest.org.uk/community-outreach/facility-hire/ Forest School (website)]</ref> The film was produced by [[DNA Films]] and [[Film4]] on a US$15 million budget.\n\nPrior to the book's publication, Garland had approached [[Andrew Macdonald (producer)|Andrew Macdonald]] and Allon Reich about a possible film, and wrote a 96-page script. The producers initially had trouble finding an actress to play Kathy. Mulligan was cast in the role after Peter Rice, the head of the company financing the film, recommended her by text message while watching her performance in ''[[An Education]]''. Mulligan, a fan of the book, enthusiastically accepted the role, as she had long desired to play the part. The film's message and themes were the factors that attracted Garfield to the film.\n\n''Never Let Me Go'' premiered at the 37th annual [[Telluride Film Festival]] in September 2010, where the audience responded positively to its message. The film was also screened at the [[2010 Toronto International Film Festival]], and it opened the [[London Film Festival#2010|54th London Film Festival]]. The film was distributed by [[Fox Searchlight Pictures]] to cinemas in the United States on 15 September 2010, where it was given a [[limited release]]. It opened on 14 January 2011 in the United Kingdom. In the United States, ''Never Let Me Go'' opened at four theatres, grossing over US$111,000 during its first weekend. The movie got off to a better start in its first weekend in the UK, earning \u00a3625,000 and taking ninth place at the box office.\n\n''Never Let Me Go'' earned US$9.5 million at the box office and an additional US$1.89 million in DVD sales revenue. ''Never Let Me Go'' was met with generally positive reviews from film critics, with most reviewers praising its portrayals.\n\n==Plot==\nThe film begins with on-screen captions explaining that a medical breakthrough in 1952 has permitted the human lifespan to be extended beyond 100 years. It is narrated by 28-year-old Kathy H as she reminisces about her childhood at a [[boarding school]] called Hailsham, as well as her adult life after leaving the school. The film first depicts the young Kathy, along with her friends Tommy and Ruth, spending their childhood at Hailsham in 1978. The students are encouraged to create artwork, and their best work gets into ''The Gallery'' run by a mysterious woman known only as Madame. One day, a new teacher, Miss Lucy, quietly informs the students of their fate: they are destined to be [[organ donors]] and will die, or \"complete\", in their early adulthood. Shortly afterward she is fired by the headmistress, Miss Emily, for sharing this revelation with the children. As time passes, Kathy falls in love with Tommy, but Ruth and Tommy begin a relationship and stay together throughout the rest of their time at Hailsham.\n\nIn the second act, Kathy, Ruth and Tommy, now teenagers, are rehoused in [[cottage]]s on a farm in 1985. They are permitted to leave the grounds on day trips, but are resigned to their eventual fate. At the farm, they meet former pupils of schools similar to theirs, and it is revealed that they are all [[Cloning|clones]]. They also hear rumours of the possibility of \"deferral\"\u2014a temporary reprieve from organ donation for donors who are in love and can prove it. Tommy becomes convinced that ''The Gallery'' at Hailsham was intended to look into their [[soul]]s and that artwork sent to ''The Gallery'' will be able to confirm true love where it is present. The relationship between Tommy and Ruth becomes sexual, and Ruth confronts Kathy, telling her Tommy never thought of her as more than a friend. This causes Kathy and Ruth to end their friendship. The lonely Kathy leaves and becomes a \"carer\"\u2014a donor who is given a temporary reprieve from donation as a reward for supporting and comforting donors as they are made to give up their organs. Tommy and Ruth's relationship ends but Kathy has already begun her training.\n\nIn 1994, Kathy is still working as a carer, and has watched many donors gradually die as their organs are harvested. Kathy, who has not seen Ruth or Tommy since the farm, discovers Ruth, frail after two donations. They find Tommy, who is also weakened by his donations, and they take a drive to the seashore, where Ruth admits that she did not love Tommy, and only seduced him because she was afraid to be alone. She is consumed with guilt and has been searching for a way to help Tommy and Kathy. She believes that the rumours of \"deferral\" are true, and has found the address of the gallery owner, Madame, who she thinks may grant deferrals to couples in love. Ruth dies on the [[operating table]] shortly afterward.\n\nKathy and Tommy finally begin a relationship. Tommy explains to Kathy that he has been creating art in the hope that it will aid deferral. He and Kathy drive to visit Madame, who lives with the headmistress of Hailsham. The two teachers tell them that there is no such thing as deferral, and that Tommy's artworks will not help him. They explain that the purpose of ''The Gallery'' was not to look into their souls but to investigate whether the \"all but human\" donors even have souls at all; Hailsham was the last place to consider the ethical implications of the donor scheme. As they take in the news on their return journey, Tommy explodes in rage and frustration, and they cling to each other in grief. Tommy completes his final donation and dies on the operating table, leaving Kathy alone, waiting for her donations to begin in a month. Contemplating the ruins of her childhood, she asks in [[voice-over]] whether her fate is really any different from the people who will receive her organs; after all, \"we all complete\".\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast list|\n* [[Carey Mulligan]] as Kathy H\n** [[Isobel Meikle-Small]] as young Kathy\n* [[Keira Knightley]] as Ruth C\n** [[Ella Purnell]] as young Ruth\n* [[Andrew Garfield]] as Tommy D\n** [[Charlie Rowe]] as young Tommy\n* [[Sally Hawkins]] as Miss Lucy\n* [[Charlotte Rampling]] as Miss Emily\n* [[Nathalie Richard]] as Madame\n* [[Domhnall Gleeson]] as Rodney\n* [[Andrea Riseborough]] as Chrissie\n}}\n\n==Themes==\nDirector Mark Romanek has said that, as in the novel, everyone has to uncover their relationship to their own mortality; there are two options: either go against it, or try to figure out a way around it like the character Tommy does.<ref name=\"nif\"/> Romanek hoped the audience of ''Never Let Me Go'' would be reminded of what is important: love, behaviour and friendships.

And I called my father, cause I realized I hadn't spoken to him in 3 weeks and I told him how much I love him and how much I appreciated what a good father he's been.\"<ref name=\"nif\"/>\n\nAndrew Garfield believes the story of ''Never Let Me Go'' is about humans, and exploring \"what it is to have a soul, and how you prove what a soul is\"; he says he enjoys the way the film is a \"call to arms\" about the positives of life.<ref name=\"ag\">{{cite web|url=http://moviesblog.mtv.com/2010/09/15/andrew-garfield-never-let-me-go-interview/|author=Marshall, Rick|title=Andrew Garfield Calls 'Never Let Me Go' Adaptation A 'Call To Arms'|work=[[MTV]]|publisher=[[Viacom (2005\u2013present)|Viacom]]|date=15 September 2010|access-date=29 September 2010}}</ref> He said that it could remind people that every morning they can choose whether to pursue their own activities, or do what they should do, or do what they are obliged to do.<ref name=\"ag\"/> Keira Knightley feels that the film's story is alarming, but has said that the film is \"more about humanity's ability to look the other way\". \"You know in fact that your morals can go out the window if you think you can survive in a certain way, whatever your morals may be\".<ref name=\"k\"/>\n\nAnimal activist Jon Hochschartner draws parallels between clone farming and the [[commodity status of animals]].

He said that most of the rehearsal schedule was devoted to ensuring that the first act would be good.<ref name=\"nif\"/> At rehearsals, the film-maker would have the younger actors observe the older actors practise the first-act scenes. This had a double purpose: the older actors would have a memory of having played those scenes, while the child actors would get a better idea of how a more skilled actor would play their part. Romanek would then mix and match the actors (for example, Mulligan would do a scene with the child playing the younger Tommy).<ref name=\"nif\"/> He also had them spend time together doing things like playing and talking.
