The project there was commissioned to develop matter transference, but made a different discovery: time travel. They also discovered that a mysterious ecological catastrophe will soon wipe out civilization.\n\nThe time travel process has negative health effects, though. Adults \"not much older than 20\" are unable to survive for long, as their kidneys hemorrhage shortly after the experience. So the scientists decide to only send young people 56 years into the future so they can build a new civilization.\n\nAfter the government takes over the project, the transfer machines are turned off, trapping a large number of project members in the future.  Now trapped, they begin exploring the future world.\nThe last survivor from the project is picked up by a family dressed in futuristic clothing.  She is placed alive in the trunk of their car, to be used as fuel. The small girl in the back seat asks what will happen when they run out of them (people from the past),\n\"Will we have to use each other, then?\"\n\n==Cast==\n*Kelley Bohanon as Karen Braden\n*Kevin Hearst as Ronald\n*Caroline Hildebrand as Isa Braden\n*[[Keith Carradine]] as Arthur\n*[[Ted D'Arms]] as George Braden\n*[[Judy Motulsky]] as Judy (as Judy Motolsky)\n*Dale Hopkins as Leslie\n*Fred Seagraves as Dr. Lewis\n*Joe Newman as Cleve\n*Susan Kelly as Nurse Nora\n*Meridith Hull as Jennifer\n*Roy B.
