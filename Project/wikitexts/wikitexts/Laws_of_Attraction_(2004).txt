It stars [[Pierce Brosnan]] and [[Julianne Moore]].\n\n==Plot==\nHigh-powered divorce attorneys Audrey Woods and Daniel Rafferty have seen love go wrong in many scenarios\u2014so, how good could their own chances be? As two of the top divorce lawyers in New York, Audrey and Daniel are a study in opposites. She practices law strictly by the book. He seems to win by the seat of his pants, or by \"cheap theatrics,\" as Audrey says in one scene.\n\nSoon the two lawyers are pitted against one another in several high-profile divorce cases, including a nasty public split between rock star Thorne Jamison and his dress-designer wife, Serena. The settlement hinges on an Irish castle, Caisle\u00e1n Cloiche, or \"Rock Castle,\" that each spouse wants. Audrey and Daniel travel to Ireland to chase down depositions, and both stay in the castle. Although Audrey, at least, is reluctant to acknowledge their mutual attraction, they find themselves attending a romantic Irish festival together. After a night of wild celebration, they wake up the next morning to discover they have wed. Audrey is shocked, though Daniel takes their apparent marriage in his stride.\n\nThe pair return to New York and find news of their wedding printed on Page 6 of the New York Post the following day. Audrey suggests the two maintain the semblance of a marriage for the sake of their careers, and Daniel moves into the guest room of Audrey's apartment. Although, in the courtroom they continue to fight the Jamisons' high-profile divorce case with the gusto they have always shown, at home, they settle into domestic life together. While disposing of garbage one day, Daniel accidentally discovers some sensitive information about Audrey's client, Thorne Jamison, which he reveals in the next day's court proceedings. Audrey feels betrayed and asks for a divorce, which Daniel agrees to give, citing his love for her.\n\nNext, their famous clients each return to the castle in Ireland, even though they are not permitted to be there because of the pending division of assets. Judge Abramovitz sends their respective counselors to Ireland to inform them of this, but on arrival they discover the celebrity couple has reconciled on the seventh anniversary of their wedding, which took place at the castle. Audrey and Daniel then learn that the \"priest\" who performed their own marriage ceremony is in fact the Jamisons' butler, and the \"weddings\" he presided over at the festival were simply romantic celebrations.\n\nDaniel returns immediately to New York, alone, but with Audrey fast on his heels, as she realizes she has fallen in love with him. Confronting him in the grocery store below Daniel's Chinatown office, Audrey asks Daniel if he is willing to fight to save their relationship. In the romantic final scenes, the couple are married in a private ceremony in Judge Abramovitz's chambers, with Audrey's mother as the sole witness.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Pierce Brosnan]] as Daniel Rafferty\n* [[Julianne Moore]] as Audrey Woods\n* [[Parker Posey]] as Serena Jamison\n* [[Michael Sheen]] as Thorne Jamison\n* [[Frances Fisher]] as Sara Miller\n* [[Nora Dunn]] as Judge Abramovitz\n* [[Mike Doyle (actor)|Mike Doyle]] as Michael Rawson\n* [[Allan Houston]] as Adamo Shandela\n* Johnny Myers as Ashton Phelps\n* Heather Ann Nurnberg as Leslie\n* [[Brette Taylor]] as Mary Harrison\n* Sarah Gilbert as Gary Gadget's assistant\n\n==Reception==\n''Laws of Attraction'' received generally negative reviews from critics, as it holds a 18% rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] where the site calls the film \"a bland and forgettable copy of ''[[Adam's Rib]]''.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/laws_of_attraction|title=Laws of Attraction (2004)|publisher=Rotten Tomatoes|access-date=7 July 2020}}</ref> On [[Metacritic]], the film holds a 38/100 rating, indicating \"generally unfavorable\" reviews.<ref>{{Metacritic film|title=Laws of Attraction}}</ref>\n\nThe film opened at No. 5 in the US box office in the weekend of 30 April 2004, raking in US$6,728,905 in its first opening weekend.<ref>{{cite web|title=Weekend Box Office Results for April 30 \u2013 May 2, 2004|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/weekend/chart/?yr=2004&wknd=18&p=.htm|publisher=[[Box Office Mojo]]|date=3 May 2004|accessdate=10 March 2013}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|0323033}}\n* {{amg movie|290201}}\n* {{tcmdb title|454816}}\n* {{AFI film|63139}}\n* {{mojo title|lawsofattraction}}\n* {{rotten-tomatoes|laws_of_attraction}}\n* {{Metacritic film}}\n\n{{Peter Howitt}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Laws of Attraction}}\n[[Category:2004 films]]\n[[Category:2004 romantic comedy films]]\n[[Category:2000s screwball comedy films]]\n[[Category:Irish romantic comedy films]]\n[[Category:British courtroom films]]\n[[Category:British romantic comedy films]]\n[[Category:German romantic comedy films]]\n[[Category:English-language German films]]\n[[Category:English-language Irish films]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Edward Shearmur]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Peter Howitt]]\n[[Category:Films about music and musicians]]\n[[Category:Films set in Ireland]]\n[[Category:Films set in New York City]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Ireland]]\n[[Category:Films shot in New York City]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by Aline Brosh McKenna]]\n[[Category:Initial Entertainment Group films]]\n[[Category:New Line Cinema films]]\n[[Category:2000s English-language films]]\n[[Category:2000s British films]]\n[[Category:2000s German films]]"}]}}}}
