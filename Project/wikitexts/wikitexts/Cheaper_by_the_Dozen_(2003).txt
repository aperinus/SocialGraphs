It is a [[remake]] of the [[Cheaper by the Dozen (1950 film)|1950 film of the same name]]. Both films were inspired by the semi-autobiographical book ''[[Cheaper by the Dozen]]'' by [[Frank Bunker Gilbreth Jr.]] and his sister [[Ernestine Gilbreth Carey]]. The 2003 version stars [[Steve Martin]], [[Bonnie Hunt]], [[Hilary Duff]], [[Tom Welling]], and [[Piper Perabo]].\n\nThe film was released on December 25, 2003, by [[20th Century Fox]] and grossed $190 million worldwide against a $40 million budget. The [[Rotten Tomatoes]] critical consensus criticized the film for its lack of humor.<ref name=\"tomatoes\" />\n\nA sequel, ''[[Cheaper by the Dozen 2]]'', was released in 2005. [[Cheaper by the Dozen (2022 film)|Another remake]] was released in 2022 on [[Disney+]].\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries should be 400 to 700 words -->\nTom and Kate Baker have raised their twelve children: Nora, Charlie, Lorraine, Henry, Sarah, Jake, Mark, Jessica, Kim, Mike, Kyle, and Nigel, in [[Midland City, Illinois|Midland, Illinois]]. Kate narrates throughout the film and hopes to publish the book she has written telling about the family's story. Tom receives a job offer from Shake McGuire to coach football at his alma mater in [[Evanston, Illinois|Evanston]]. Tom accepts the offer, but the children oppose his decision to move and are unwilling to leave their friends. The atmosphere at the Bakers' new house becomes tense, and Charlie and Mark are bullied at their respective schools.\n\nKate embarks on a national book tour to promote her newly published book. Tom has Nora and her self-absorbed boyfriend, Hank, help look after the other children while Kate is away. The younger children dislike Hank as he hates children. When Hank arrives, the children trip him into a kiddie pool filled with dirty water then soak his underwear in raw meat while he is showering. At lunch, the children unleash their dog on him. Nora and Hank storm off, and Tom angrily cuts off the children's allowances for their actions.\n\nAfter a chaotic night, Tom realizes he cannot handle the children on his own. No babysitter is willing to work with a family this large, so Tom brings the football players to practice in the living room for Saturday night's game as the children do their chores. The younger children crash the birthday party of their neighbor, Dylan Shenk, which Tom had forbidden them to attend for fighting in school and not doing their chores. When a frustrated and homesick Charlie is taken off his school's football team, he accuses Tom of moving for selfish reasons. Tom discovers Hank sneaked in and slept over, violating the rules. Hank upsets Nora by saying he does not want children and expects her to feel the same.\n\nKate gets a call from the children about the chaos and cancels her book tour. Her publisher instead invites [[Oprah Winfrey]] to film the Bakers in their home. Despite Kate's coaching, the Bakers cannot recreate the loving, strongly bonded family she describes in her book. Before the filming starts, Mark is upset when his pet frog, Beans, dies, but Sarah coldly says nobody cares, causing a fight to erupt and the producers tell Winfrey to cancel the filming.\n\nLater that night, Kate discovers that Mark has run away from home. Tom believes Mark is trying to return to the Bakers' old home and finds him on a train bound for Midland. The Bakers reunite the next day and begin to address their issues. Tom retires from his job to spend more time with his family. At the end of the film, the Bakers celebrate Christmas together as the chandelier in their living room breaks off the ceiling and crashes to the floor.\n\n==Cast==\n===Bakers===\n* [[Steve Martin]] as Tom Baker, the patriarch of the Baker family\n* [[Bonnie Hunt]] as Kate Baker, the matriarch of the Baker family and the narrator of the film\n* [[Piper Perabo]] as Nora Baker, the eldest Baker child\n* [[Tom Welling]] as Charlie Baker, the second Baker child\n* [[Hilary Duff]] as Lorraine Baker, the third Baker child\n* [[Kevin G.
