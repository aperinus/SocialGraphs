The film stars [[Jackie Chan]], with a supporting cast of [[Amber Valletta]], [[Magn\u00fas Scheving]], [[Madeline Carroll]], Will Shadley, Alina Foley, [[Billy Ray Cyrus]] and [[George Lopez]]. Filming started in late October 2008 in [[Rio Rancho]], [[New Mexico]] and was finished in late December 2008. The film was released on January 15, 2010 in the United States by [[Lionsgate]]. The film was released on DVD, and Blu-ray on May 18, 2010. The film tributes Chan's films by showing clips, references and even referencing Chan's real life childhood. The film received negative reviews from critics and it earned $45.2 million on a $28 million budget.\n\n==Plot==\nBob Ho is an operative of the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] as an undercover agent on loan from the Chinese Intelligence, who decides to retire after putting [[Russians|Russian]] terrorist Anton Poldark behind bars and marry his longtime girlfriend Gillian, who lives next door and has three children from previous relationships, Farren (a step-daughter), Ian and Nora. None of them know about his real job and think he works at a pen importing company.\n\nOne day, Gillian leaves to visit her father in a hospital in [[Denver, Colorado]] and leaves Bob to take care of her children, but Farren and Ian despise him and plot to get rid of him. Using technology from the CIA, Bob is able to take control and gradually bonds with the children. His partner, Colton James, informs him that Poldark has escaped from jail and they suspect there is a mole in the CIA. Colton sends a file to Bob's computer for a top-secret formula for an [[Microbial biodegradation|oil-eating bacteria]] Poldark is working on. While snooping around Bob's house, Ian downloads the file, which he mistakes for music, onto his iPod. Poldark discovers the download and sends some of his henchmen to Bob's house, but Bob overpowers them.\n\nAfter the attack, Bob and the children hide at a [[Chinese restaurant]], where Poldark's teenage henchman, Larry, tries to kill Bob. Bob defeats him and is forced to tell the children about his job. His boss Glaze then arrives, points a gun at him and demands the downloaded file, revealing himself to be working for Poldark. Bob knocks out Glaze with Nora's turtle, then hides in a hotel with the children. Farren tells Gillian over the phone about Bob's secret. As they wait, Farren stubbornly holds out hope that her biological father will come back to get her so she can have a 'real family'. Bob tells her that family is more than just sharing blood ties with someone, revealing that he never knew his birth parents and was raised in a Chinese orphanage. As a result, Bob chose to think of everyone else at the orphanage as his family despite not being related to anyone there. Ferran realizes that her father is not coming back for her and accepts Ian and Nora as her siblings. Fearing for her children's safety, Gillian flies home to take them back and angrily breaks up with him for lying to her.\n\nBob heads to an abandoned factory to confront the Russian terrorists but finds that Ian, wanting to become a spy, followed him and Farren has run away from home to try and help as well. The three are captured by the Russians, who trick Ian into revealing that the file is on his iPod quite easily since Ian doesn't know how to handle an interrogation. As Poldark, his partner Tatiana, and Glaze go to Gillian's house, Bob and the children escape and return home, where Poldark and his crew arrive soon after. Bob, Gillian's family and the terrorists fight, with the children using Bob's secret weapons to defeat some of them, and soon after Colton and his crew arrive to arrest the Russians and Glaze. Gillian initially rejects Bob, but changes her mind when her children express their heartfelt approval of him with Farren even calling her 'Mom' for the first time. In the end, Bob and Gillian get married. At the altar, Bob confesses to Gillian that Bob is not his real name, which Gillian and her children accept with a laugh.\n\n==Cast==\n<!-- First billed only. -->\n* [[Jackie Chan]] as Bob Ho, a spy for the CIA and Gillian's neighbour, boyfriend and eventual husband\n* [[Amber Valletta]] as Gillian, Bob's neighbour, girlfriend and eventual wife \n* [[Magn\u00fas Scheving]] as Anton Poldark, a Russian terrorist\n* [[Madeline Carroll]] as Farren, Gillian's step-daughter \n* Will Shadley as Ian, Gillian's son \n* Alina Foley as Nora, Gillian's daughter\n* [[Billy Ray Cyrus]] as Colton James, Bob's partner \n* [[George Lopez]] as Glaze, Bob's corrupt boss\n* [[Lucas Till]] as Larry, a teenager working with Poldark\n*Katherine Boecher as Tatiana Creel, Poldark's girlfriend and henchman\n* [[Tim Connolly]] as Russian thug \n* [[Troy Brenna]] as Russian thug\n* [[Jeff Chase]] as Russian thug\n* [[Mark Kubr]] as Russian thug \n* [[David Mattey]] as Russian thug \n* Scott Workman as Russian thug\n* Esodie Geiger as Principal \n* Arron Shiver as Scientist \n* Richard Christie as Judge\n\n==Soundtrack==\n* \"[[Secret Agent Man (Johnny Rivers song)|Secret Agent Man]]\" \u2013 Performed by [[Johnny Rivers]]\n* \"The Way It Was\" \u2013 Written and Performed by Daniel May\n* \"Ba Ma De Hua\" \u2013 Performed by Jackie Chan (theme song of ''[[Rob-B-Hood]]'', a film also made by Chan)\n* \"[[One Way or Another]]\" \u2013 Performed by [[Blondie (band)|Blondie]]\n\n==Release==\n\n===Box office===\nIn its first weekend, in the US, ''The Spy Next Door'' made $9.7 million in 2,924 theaters, opening at #6.
