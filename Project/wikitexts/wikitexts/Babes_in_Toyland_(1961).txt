It stars [[Ray Bolger]] as Barnaby, [[Tommy Sands (American singer)|Tommy Sands]] as Tom Piper, [[Annette Funicello]] as Mary Contrary and [[Ed Wynn]] as the Toymaker.<ref>{{cite news|author=Jones, Tom|title=Disney Live 'Toyland': Victor Herbert Musical Is Re-created In Manufactured Never-Never Land|newspaper=The New York Times|date=11 June 1961|page= X7}}</ref>\n\nThe film is based upon [[Victor Herbert]]'s popular 1903 operetta ''[[Babes in Toyland (operetta)|Babes in Toyland]]''. There had been a 1934 film also titled ''[[Babes in Toyland (1934 film)|Babes in Toyland]]'' starring [[Laurel and Hardy]], and three television adaptations prior to the Disney film, but Disney's was only the second film version of the operetta released to movie theatres and the first in Technicolor. The plot, and in some cases the music, bear little resemblance to the original, as Disney had most of the lyrics rewritten and some of the song [[tempo]]s drastically changed, including the memorable song \"Toyland\", a slow ballad, which was sped up with only the chorus sung in a march-like rhythm.<ref name=\"new\"/>\n\nThe toy soldiers later appeared in [[Christmas parade]]s at the [[Disney theme park]]s around the world.\n\nFunicello said it was her favorite filmmaking experience.{{sfn|Funicello|Romanowski|1994|page=[https://archive.org/details/dreamiswishyourh00funic/page/124 124]}}\n\n== Plot ==\nA stage play begins, presented by [[Mother Goose]] and her talking goose, Sylvester, about [[Mary, Mary, Quite Contrary|Mary Contrary]] and [[Tom, Tom, the Piper's Son|Tom Piper]], who are about to be married. The miserly and villainous Barnaby hires two crooks, dimwitted Gonzorgo and silent Roderigo. They are to throw Tom into the sea and steal Mary's sheep, depriving her of her means of support, to force her to marry Barnaby. Mary is unaware that she is the heir to a fortune, but Barnaby is aware and wants it all for himself. Gonzorgo and Roderigo decide to sell Tom to the [[Gypsy|Gypsies]] instead of drowning him, in order to collect a double payment.\n\nGonzorgo and Roderigo return and tell Mary, Barnaby, and the citizens of Mother Goose Land that Tom has accidentally drowned. They show Mary a forged letter in which Tom tells Mary he is abandoning her, and she would be better off marrying Barnaby. Mary, believing she is destitute, reluctantly accepts the proposal from Barnaby. Barnaby unknowingly arranges for the same Gypsies who have Tom to provide entertainment for the wedding. Tom, disguised as the Gypsy Floretta, reveals himself, and Barnaby pursues the frightened Gonzorgo and Roderigo, furious at their deception.\n\nOne of the children who lives with Mary informs her of some sheep tracks leading into the Forest of No Return. The children sneak away into the forest to search for the missing sheep. The trees of the forest awaken and capture them. Tom and Mary follow and find the children in the forest, where they tell stories about the live trees. The trees seem just like ordinary trees to Tom and Mary. Tom, Mary, and the children camp for the night. In the morning, the trees once again come to life and explain that they are now in custody of the Toymaker in Toyland (who is also the Mayor and Chief of Police). Tom, Mary, and the children happily continue on, escorted part of the way by the trees.\n\nThrough the windows of the Toymaker's house they watch the Toymaker's brilliant apprentice, Grumio, present a new machine that makes toys without any manual labor. Overjoyed, the Toymaker speeds up the machine to such a high rate that it explodes, destroying every toy in the factory. Tom, Mary, and the children offer to help make more toys in time for [[Christmas]].\n\nGrumio presents another invention, a shrinking \"gun\" that reduces everyday objects to toy size. He warns that if it is used on anything more than once, the shrunken object disappears completely. The Toymaker is at first delighted at the idea of producing toys by shrinking life-sized objects, but then Tom points out the impossibility of finding enough everyday objects to shrink down into the large quantity of toys needed for Christmas. The Toymaker berates Grumio for his stupidity and throws the shrinking gun out the window in disgust.\n\nBarnaby, who has been spying on them, takes the discarded shrinking gun and uses it to shrink the Toymaker and Tom. When Barnaby's henchmen see him threatening to shoot Tom a second time, they abandon Barnaby. They try to flee, but Barnaby shoots them and locks them up with Tom in a birdcage.\n\nBarnaby forces Mary to marry him by threatening to destroy Tom, and he threatens to destroy the Toymaker if he refuses to preside over the wedding ceremony. While the Toymaker draws out the ceremony, Gonzorgo and Roderigo rescue Tom, and the three of them sneak away and return with an army of toy soldiers to fight Barnaby. Barnaby easily demolishes the toy soldiers. He is about to obliterate Tom with another dose from the shrinking gun, but Mary destroys it with a toy cannon. The liquid splatters all over Barnaby and shrinks him to toy size. Tom, after challenging Barnaby to a duel with swords, stabs Barnaby, who falls from a great height into an empty toybox.\n\nDuring the battle with Barnaby, Grumio creates and presents another new invention, one that returns miniaturized people and items to their original size. He immediately uses it on the Toymaker, Gonzorgo, and Roderigo, but not on Barnaby. Grumio is about to use it on Tom, but after reminding Grumio that he is the head toymaker and that Grumio is just his assistant, the Toymaker uses the invention himself to return Tom to his natural size.\n\nA few days later, Tom and Mary are married attended by all of Mother Goose Village including Gonzorgo and Roderigo as well as the trees from the Forest of No Return, and everyone lives happily ever after as the stage curtains close, ending the film.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{colbegin|colwidth=40em}}\n* [[Ray Bolger]] \u2013 Barnaby\n* [[Tommy Sands (American singer)|Tommy Sands]] \u2013 [[Tom, Tom, the Piper's Son|Tom Piper]]\n* [[Annette Funicello]] \u2013 [[Mary, Mary, Quite Contrary|Mary Contrary]]\n* [[Ed Wynn]] \u2013 Toymaker\n* [[Tommy Kirk]] \u2013 Grumio\n* [[Kevin Corcoran]] \u2013 [[Little Boy Blue|Boy Blue]]\n* [[Henry Calvin]] \u2013 Gonzorgo\n* [[Gene Sheldon]] \u2013 Roderigo\n* [[Mary McCarty (actress)|Mary McCarty]] \u2013 [[Mother Goose]]\n* [[Ann Jillian]]n \u2013 [[Little Bo Peep|Bo Peep]]\n* [[Kevin Corcoran#Family|Brian Corcoran]] \u2013 [[Wee Willie Winkie|Willie Winkie]]\n* Marilee and Melanie Arnold \u2013 Twin 2\n* Jerry Glenn \u2013 [[Simple Simon (nursery rhyme)|Simple Simon]]\n* John Perri \u2013 [[Jack Be Nimble|Jack-Be-Nimble]]\n* David Pinson \u2013 [[Bobby Shafto's Gone to Sea|Bobby Shaftoe]]\n* Bryan Russell \u2013 The Little Boy\n* James Martin \u2013 [[Jack and Jill (nursery rhyme)|Jack]]\n* Ilana Dowding \u2013 [[Jack and Jill (nursery rhyme)|Jill]]\n* Robert Banas (''uncredited'') \u2013 Russian Dancer\n* Eileen Diamond (''uncredited'') \u2013 Dancer\n* [[Bess Flowers]] (''uncredited'') \u2013 Villager\n* [[Jeannie Russell]] (''uncredited'') \u2013 Singer (voice)\n{{Div col end}}\n\n== Production ==\n=== Development ===\nIn May 1955, [[Walt Disney]] announced that he would produce ''Babes in Toyland'' as an animated feature.<ref>{{cite news |author=Hopper, Hedda |title=Disney's next cartoon film will be 'Babes in Toyland{{' \"}} |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/65778500/clipped-from-the-chicago-tribune/ |newspaper=Chicago Daily Tribune |date=May 17, 1955|via=[[Newspapers.com]] |id={{ProQuest|179440596}}}} {{Open access}}</ref> By October 1956, Disney had assigned Bill Walsh to produce and Sidney Miller to direct the project.<ref>Hopper, Hedda (October 20, 1956).

In his script, he excised the orphans subplot and focused the story on a love triangle between Tom, Mary Contrary, and Barnaby. In the following months, Kimball worked alongside story artist Joe Rinaldi and effects animator [[Joshua Meador]] to ensure the film would be visually interesting.{{sfn|Pierce|2019|page=223}} In June 1960, Disney told the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'': \"We're updating the lyrics; the music, of course, is Victor Herbert's.

Furthermore, with the studio's option on the film rights set to expire within a year, a studio publicist placed trade advertisements that promoted Kimball's work on the film, leading to Disney deciding that Kimball had got above himself.{{sfn|Pierce|2019|pages=224\u2013225}} Kimball was also traveling to New York to scout for Broadway actors to cast in the film.

The ''Babes in Toyland'' sets were showcased in [[Disneyland]] Park as an attraction following the film's release and the Toy Soldiers became an iconic symbol of the holidays at Disneyland, [[Walt Disney World]] Resort and other Disney Parks around the world, considered a \"draw\" and featured heavily in television, online and print advertising rivaling the castles and the famous Disney characters in appearances. Disney's ''Babes in Toyland'' Soldiers are the equivalent of the [[The Rockettes|Rockettes]]' appearance at the [[Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade]] in that park guests and TV viewers expect to see them every year.\n\nThe soldiers also appear in the stop-motion nursery sequence in Walt Disney's 1964 musical fantasy [[Mary Poppins (film)|''Mary Poppins'']]. They were designed by Disney animator and [[Imagineering (company)|Imagineer]] [[Bill Justice]], who with fellow Imagineer [[Xavier Atencio|X Atencio]], created the sequence in the film. Justice designed to park soldiers to match the ''Babes in Toyland'' movie soldiers exactly as they appeared in the 1961. They made their television debut on ''[[Walt Disney's Wonderful World of Color]]'' when Walt Disney presented the Disneyland Christmas parade in the episode, \"[[Holiday Time at Disneyland]].\"\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of Christmas films]]\n\n== References ==\n;Citations\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n;Bibliography \n* {{cite book |last1=Funicello |first1=Annette |last2=Romanowski |first2=Patricia |title=A Dream Is a Wish Your Heart Makes: My Story |url=https://archive.org/details/dreamiswishyourh00funic |url-access=registration |year=1994 |publisher=Hyperion |isbn=978-0-786-88092-8}} \n* {{cite book |last=Pierce |first=Todd James |title=The Life and Times of Ward Kimball: Maverick of Disney Animation |year=2019 |publisher=[[University Press of Mississippi]] |isbn=978-1-496-82096-9}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{Official website}}\n* {{IMDb title}}\n* {{Tcmdb title}}\n* {{Rotten Tomatoes}}\n* {{DisneyAtoZ|title=''Babies in Toyland''}}\n* {{cite web|url=http://thehistoryofdisney.blogspot.com/2011/12/very-merry-musical-walt-disneys-babes.html |title=A Very Merry Musical: Walt Disney's ''Babes in Toyland''|date= December 2011 |website= The History of Disney}}\n\n{{Disney Christmas films}}\n{{Jack Donohue}}\n{{Ward Kimball}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:1961 films]]\n[[Category:1960s fantasy films]]\n[[Category:1960s musical films]]\n[[Category:American Christmas films]]\n[[Category:American coming-of-age films]]\n[[Category:American children's fantasy films]]\n[[Category:American fantasy adventure films]]\n[[Category:American films with live action and animation]]\n[[Category:American musical fantasy films]]\n[[Category:Films about toys]]\n[[Category:Films about children]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Jack Donohue]]\n[[Category:Films produced by Walt Disney]]\n[[Category:Films scored by George Bruns]]\n[[Category:Films using stop-motion animation]]\n[[Category:Films about sentient toys]]\n[[Category:Films about size change]]\n[[Category:Walt Disney Pictures films]]\n[[Category:Films set in forests]]\n[[Category:Films set in Spain]]\n[[Category:1960s Christmas films]]\n[[Category:1960s coming-of-age films]]\n[[Category:1960s English-language films]]\n[[Category:1960s American films]]"}]}}}}
