To Hunt Elephants) is a 2013 Israeli [[crime comedy]] film directed by [[Reshef Levi]].<ref>[http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/hunting-elephants-latzoud-pilim-palm-670584 \"Hunting Elephants (Latzoud Pilim): Palm Springs Review\"].

''Sydney Morning Herald'' November 28, 2013 Jake Wilson</ref> It stars, among others, [[Sasson Gabai]], [[Moni Moshonov]] and [[Patrick Stewart]]. It was released to theaters in [[Israel]] on July 4, 2013.\n\nThe plot centers around Jonathan ([[Gil Blank]]), a 12-year-old boy who, with his grandfather and two others, attempts to rob the bank where his deceased father had worked. The film received mixed reviews from critics.\n\n==Plot==\nJonathan's father, Daniel ([[Zvika Hadar|Tzvika Hadar]]), dies of a [[heart attack]] in his workplace, with Jonathan present but unable to help him. The bank manager, Dedi ([[Moshe Ivgy]]), refuses to pay compensation because the contract with the insurance company doesn't cover such events. Jonathan's mother, Dorit ([[Yael Abecassis]]), starts going out with Dedi because she needs the money, leaving Jonathan in an elderly home with his grandfather Eliyahu ([[Sasson Gabai]]).\n\nEliyahu and his friend Nick ([[Moni Moshonov]]) are former [[Lehi (group)|Lehi]] fighters who used to rob British banks to fund the organization's activities. Eliyahu had been at odds with Daniel and Dorit for many years, and hated Dorit for not having an abortion and, in his opinion, ruining Daniel's life and burying his career. Eliyahu's wife Roda ([[Rina Schenfeld]]) is in a coma in their elderly home, with no chance of recovery. She was the daughter of a British lord and inherited his estate in Israel, while her brother Michael Simpson ([[Patrick Stewart]]), broke because he chose to be a theater actor to the chagrin of their father, seeks to take Roda off life support and get the estate. The estate had in fact already been sold by Eliyahu to pay for Roda's lengthy hospitalization and a home for himself and Nick.\n\nTo solve their financial problems, Jonathan, Michael, Eliyahu and Nick plan to rob the bank where Daniel worked, being intimately familiar with the bank's defense systems. They stage a number of diversions which causes the bank to turn off one of the main alarm systems, allowing them to enter the safe. The first plan goes awry when Nick, who was supposed to be a hostage himself, takes a guard's gun and his own hostages, but he is not sent to prison because of his [[dementia]]. Eliyahu then robs the bank himself, and Jonathan, pretending to be a victim, burns some of the money in front of the police, allowing him to get away with most of the stolen cash.\n\n==Cast==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Character!!Actor\n|-\n|Jonathan\n|[[Gil Blank]]\n|-\n|Eliyahu\n|[[Sasson Gabai]]\n|-\n|Nick\n|[[Moni Moshonov]]\n|-\n|Michael Simpson\n|[[Patrick Stewart]]\n|-\n|Dorit\n|[[Yael Abecassis]]\n|-\n|Dedi\n|[[Moshe Ivgy]]\n|-\n|Daniel\n|[[Zvika Hadar]]\n|-\n|Roda\n|[[Rina Schenfeld]]\n|-\n|Sigi\n|Rotem Zisman-Cohen\n|}\n\n==Production==\nBritish actor [[John Cleese]] was signed up for the role of Michael Simpson, but due to heart problems he was unable to perform in the film.

It praised the cast however, saying that it saved the film.<ref name=\"walla-review\" />\n\n==See also==\n* [[2013 in Israeli film]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|refs=\n<ref name=\"haaretz-review\">{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.co.il/.premium-1.2061343|title=Reshef Levi's White Elephant|author=Uri Klein|work=[[Haaretz]]|date=July 5, 2013|accessdate=July 13, 2013|language=he}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"nrg-review\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nrg.co.il/online/47/ART2/486/998.html|title=\"Hunting Elephants\": About Pensioners and Guns|author=Avraham, Yael|work=nrg Ma'ariv|date=July 5, 2013|accessdate=July 13, 2013|language=he}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"walla-review\">{{cite web|url=http://news.walla.co.il/?w=/200/2657626|title=\"Hunting Elephants\": Depressing Movie Saved Only By Talented Actors|author=Parhomovsky, Marat|work=[[Walla!]]|date=July 7, 2013|accessdate=July 13, 2013|language=he}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"ynet-review\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ynet.co.il/articles/0,7340,L-4400838,00.html|title=\"Hunting Elephants\": A While Elephant on the Screen|author=Duvdevani, Shmulik|work=[[Ynet]]|date=July 5, 2013|accessdate=July 13, 2013|language=he}}</ref>\n}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|2295196}}\n\n[[Category:2013 films]]\n[[Category:Films set in Jerusalem]]\n[[Category:Films about old age]]\n[[Category:2010s crime comedy films]]\n[[Category:Israeli crime comedy films]]\n[[Category:2013 comedy films]]"}]}}}}
