Produced and distributed by [[Toho|Toho Co., Ltd.]], it is the first film in the [[Godzilla (franchise)|''Godzilla'' franchise]]. The film stars [[Akira Takarada]], [[Momoko K\u014dchi]], [[Akihiko Hirata]], and [[Takashi Shimura]], with [[Haruo Nakajima]] and [[Katsumi Tezuka]] as Godzilla. In the film, Japan's authorities deal with the sudden appearance of a giant monster, whose attacks trigger fears of [[nuclear holocaust]] during [[Post-occupation Japan|post-war Japan]].\n\n''Godzilla'' entered production after a Japanese-Indonesian co-production collapsed. Tsuburaya originally proposed for a giant octopus before the filmmakers decided on a dinosaur-inspired creature. ''Godzilla'' pioneered a form of special effects called [[suitmation]], in which a stunt performer wearing a suit interacts with miniature sets. Principal photography ran 51 days, and special effects photography ran 71 days.\n\n''Godzilla'' was theatrically released in Japan on November 3, 1954, and earned {{\u00a5|183 million}} in [[distributor rentals]] during its original theatrical run. The film initially received mixed reviews in Japan but received reappraise in later years. In 1956, a heavily re-edited \"Americanized\" version, titled ''[[Godzilla, King of the Monsters!]]'' was released in the United States. The film spawned a multimedia franchise, being recognized by ''[[Guinness World Records]]'' as the longest-running film franchise in history. The character Godzilla has since become an international pop culture icon. The film and Tsuburaya have been largely credited for establishing the template for ''[[tokusatsu]]'' media. Since its release, the film has been regarded as a cinematic achievement and one of the best monster films ever made.\n\nThe film was followed by ''[[Godzilla Raids Again]]'', released on April 24, 1955.{{sfn|Kalat|2010|p=34}}\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- PER WP:FILMPLOT, PLOT SUMMARIES FOR FEATURE FILMS SHOULD BE 400-700 WORDS. -->\nWhen the Japanese freighter ''Eiko-maru'' is destroyed near Odo Island, another ship\u2014the ''Bingo-maru''\u2014is sent to investigate, only to meet the same fate with few survivors. A fishing boat from Odo is also destroyed, with one survivor. Fishing catches mysteriously drop to zero, blamed by an elder on the ancient sea creature known as \"[[Godzilla]]\". Reporters arrive on Odo Island to further investigate. A villager tells one of the reporters that something in the sea is ruining the fishing. That evening, a storm strikes the island, destroying the reporters' helicopter, and Godzilla, briefly seen by some of the villagers, destroys 17 homes and kills nine people and 20 of the villagers' livestock.\n\nOdo residents travel to Tokyo to demand disaster relief. The villagers' and reporters' evidence describes damage consistent with something large crushing the village. The government sends paleontologist Kyohei Yamane to lead an investigation on the island, where giant radioactive footprints and a [[trilobite]] are discovered. The village alarm bell is rung and Yamane and the villagers rush to see the monster, retreating after seeing that it is a giant [[dinosaur]]. Yamane presents his findings in Tokyo, estimating that Godzilla is 50m tall and is evolved from an ancient sea creature becoming a terrestrial creature. He concludes that Godzilla has been disturbed by underwater [[Thermonuclear weapon|hydrogen bomb]] testing. Debate ensues about notifying the public about the danger of the monster. Meanwhile, 17 ships are lost at sea.\n\nTen [[frigate]]s are dispatched to attempt to kill the monster using [[depth charge]]s. The mission disappoints Yamane, who wants Godzilla to be studied. When Godzilla survives the attack, officials appeal to Yamane for ideas to kill the monster, but Yamane tells them that Godzilla is unkillable, having survived H-bomb testing, and must be studied. Yamane's daughter, Emiko, decides to break off her arranged engagement to Yamane's colleague, Daisuke Serizawa, because of her love for Hideto Ogata, a salvage ship captain. When a reporter arrives and asks to interview Serizawa, Emiko escorts the reporter to Serizawa's home. After Serizawa refuses to divulge his current work to the reporter, he gives Emiko a demonstration of his recent project on the condition that she must keep it a secret. The demonstration horrifies her and she leaves without mentioning the engagement. Shortly after she returns home, Godzilla surfaces from [[Tokyo Bay]] and attacks [[Shinagawa]]. After attacking a passing train, Godzilla returns to the ocean.\n\nAfter consulting international experts, the [[Japanese Self-Defense Forces]] construct a 30m tall and 50,000 volt [[electrified fence]] along the coast and deploy forces to stop and kill Godzilla.  Dismayed that there is no plan to study Godzilla for its resistance to radiation, Yamane returns home, where Emiko and Ogata await, hoping to get his consent for them to wed. When Ogata disagrees with Yamane, arguing that the threat that Godzilla poses outweighs any potential benefits from studying the monster, Yamane tells him to leave. Godzilla resurfaces and breaks through the fence to Tokyo with its atomic breath, unleashing more destruction across the city. Further attempts to kill the monster with [[tank]]s and [[Jet fighter|fighter jets]] fail and Godzilla returns to the ocean. The day after, hospitals and shelters are crowded with the maimed and the dead, with some survivors suffering from [[radiation sickness]].\n\nDistraught by the devastation, Emiko tells Ogata about Serizawa's research, a weapon called the \"Oxygen Destroyer\", which disintegrates [[oxygen]] atoms and causes organisms to die of a rotting [[asphyxiation]]. Emiko and Ogata go to Serizawa to convince him to use the Oxygen Destroyer but he initially refuses, explaining that if he uses the device, the superpowers of the world will surely force him to construct more Oxygen Destroyers for use as a [[Super weapons|superweapon]]. After watching a program displaying the nation's current tragedy, Serizawa finally accepts their pleas. As Serizawa burns his notes, Emiko breaks down crying.\n\nA navy ship takes Ogata and Serizawa to plant the device in Tokyo Bay. After finding Godzilla, Serizawa unloads the device and cuts off his air support, taking the secret of the Oxygen Destroyer to his grave. Godzilla is destroyed, but many mourn Serizawa's death. Yamane believes that if [[nuclear weapons testing]] continues, another Godzilla may rise in the future.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Akira Takarada]] as Hideto Ogata\n* [[Momoko K\u014dchi]] as Emiko Yamane\n* [[Akihiko Hirata]] as Dr. Daisuke Serizawa\n* [[Takashi Shimura]] as Dr. Kyohei Yamane\n* Fuyuki Murakami as Dr. Tanabe\n* [[Sachio Sakai]] as Hagiwara\n* Ren Yamamoto as Masaji Yamada\n* Toyoaki Suzuki as Shinkichi Yamada\n* Toranosuke Ogawa as the President of the Nankai Shipping Company\n* Hiroshi Hayashi as the Chairman of Diet Committee\n* Seijiro Onda as Oyama, Diet Committee member\n* [[Kin Sugai]] as Ozawa, Diet Committee member\n* [[Shoichi Hirose]] as a member of the Diet Committee{{sfn|Yosensha|2014|p=112}}\n* [[Kokuten K\u014dd\u014d]] as the old fisherman\n* [[Y\u016b Fujiki]] as ''Eiko-Maru'' wireless communications officer{{sfn|Yosensha|2014|p=106}}\n* [[Kenji Sahara]] as a reporter and a partygoer{{sfn|Tanaka|1983|p=530}}\n* [[Ishir\u014d Honda]] as a power station worker{{sfn|Nollen|2019|p=196}}\n* [[Haruo Nakajima]] as [[Godzilla]], a newspaper reporter,{{sfn|Tanaka|1983|p=532}} and a substation engineer{{sfn|Motoyama|Matsunomoto|Asai|Suzuki|2012|p=5}}\n* [[Katsumi Tezuka]] as Godzilla and a newspaper deskman\n{{div col end}}\n\nCast taken from ''Japan's Favorite Mon-Star'',{{sfn|Ryfle|1998|p=351}} except where cited otherwise.\n\n==Themes==\nIn the film, Godzilla symbolizes [[nuclear holocaust]] from Japan's perspective and has since been culturally identified as a strong metaphor for nuclear weapons.<ref name=\"Brian\">{{cite web |last=Merchant |first=Brian |date=August 25, 2013 |title=A Brief History of Godzilla, Our Never-Ending Nuclear Nightmare |url=https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/8gd4e3/a-brief-history-of-godzilla-our-never-ending-nuclear-nightmare |work=[[Vice (magazine)|Vice]] |access-date=June 9, 2018 |archive-date=June 12, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180612143920/https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/8gd4e3/a-brief-history-of-godzilla-our-never-ending-nuclear-nightmare |url-status=live }}</ref> Producer [[Tomoyuki Tanaka]] stated that, \"The theme of the film, from the beginning, was the terror of the bomb.

So, I took the characteristics of an atomic bomb and applied them to Godzilla.\"<ref name=\"footprint\"/>\n\nOn March 1, 1954, just a few months before the film was made, the Japanese fishing vessel ''[[Daigo Fukury\u016b Maru]]'' (\"Lucky Dragon No. 5\") had been showered with radioactive fallout from the U.S. military's 15-megaton \"[[Castle Bravo]]\" hydrogen bomb test at nearby [[Bikini Atoll]].{{sfn|Kapur|2018|p=16}} The boat's catch was contaminated, spurring a panic in Japan about the safety of eating fish, and the crew was sickened, with one crew member eventually dying from radiation sickness.{{sfn|Kapur|2018|p=16}} This event led to the emergence of a large and enduring [[anti-nuclear movement]] that gathered 30 million signatures on an anti-nuclear petition by August 1955 and eventually became institutionalized as the [[Japan Council against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs]].{{sfn|Kapur|2018|p=16}} The film's opening scene of Godzilla destroying a Japanese vessel is a direct reference to these events, and had a strong impact on Japanese viewers with this recent event still fresh in the mind of the public.{{sfn|Ryfle|Godziszewski|2006|loc=00:02:08}}\n\nAcademics [[Anne Allison]], Thomas Schnellb\u00e4cher, and Steve Ryfle have said that ''Godzilla'' contains political and cultural undertones that can be attributed to what the Japanese had experienced in [[World War II]] and that Japanese audiences were able to connect emotionally to the monster. They theorized that these viewers saw Godzilla as a victim and felt that the creature's backstory reminded them of their experiences in World War II. These academics have also claimed that as the atomic bomb testing that woke Godzilla was carried out by the United States, the film in a way can be seen to blame the United States for the problems and struggles that Japan experienced after World War II had ended. They also felt that the film could have served as a cultural coping method to help the people of Japan move on from the events of the war.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Millennial Monsters |last=Allison|first=Anne|publisher=University of California Press|date=June 30, 2006|isbn=9780520245655|pages=45\u201369}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Schnellb\u00e4cher |first1=Thomas|title=Has the Empire Sunk Yet?: The Pacific in Japanese Science Fiction|journal=[[Science Fiction Studies]]|date=November 2002 |volume=29 |issue=3 |pages=382\u2013396}}</ref><ref name=\"footprint\">{{cite journal|last1=Ryfle|first1=Steve|title=Godzilla's Footprint|journal=Virginia Quarterly Review|date=Winter 2005 |volume=81 |issue=1 |pages=44\u201368}}</ref>\n\nBrian Merchant from ''[[Motherboard (Vice)|Motherboard]]'' called the film \"a bleak, powerful metaphor for nuclear power that still endures today\" and on its themes, he stated: \"It's an unflinchingly bleak, deceptively powerful film about coping with and taking responsibility for incomprehensible, manmade tragedy.

Very few constructs have so perfectly embodied the overriding fears of a particular era. He is the symbol of a world gone wrong, a work of man that once created cannot be taken back or deleted. He rears up out of the sea as a creature of no particular belief system, apart from even the most elastic version of evolution and taxonomy, a reptilian [[Id (Freud)|id]] that lives inside the deepest recesses of the collective unconscious that cannot be reasoned with, a merciless undertaker who broaches no deals.\" Regarding the film, Jacobson stated, \"Honda's first Godzilla... is in line with these inwardly turned post-war films and perhaps the most brutally unforgiving of them. Shame-ridden self-flagellation was in order, and who better to supply the rubber-suited psychic punishment than the [[Rorschach test|Rorschach]]-shaped big fella himself?\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://vulture.com/2014/05/godzilla-meaning-monster-metaphors.html|title=What Does Godzilla Mean?

Its roster of frightening images\u2014cities in flames, overstuffed hospitals, irradiated children\u2014would have been all too familiar to cinemagoers for whom memories of Hiroshima and Nagasaki were still less than a decade old, while its script posed deliberately inflammatory questions about the balance of postwar power and the development of nuclear energy.\" Martin also commented how the film's themes were omitted in the American version, stating, \"Its thematic preoccupation with nuclear energy proved even less acceptable to the American distributors who, after buying the film, began an extensive reshoot and recut for Western markets.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/10788996/Godzilla-why-the-Japanese-original-is-no-joke.html|title=Godzilla: why the Japanese original is no joke|first=Tim|last=Martin|work=The Daily Telegraph|date=May 15, 2014|access-date=June 9, 2018|archive-date=June 14, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180614032134/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/10788996/Godzilla-why-the-Japanese-original-is-no-joke.html|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Production==\n===Crew===\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Ishir\u014d Honda]] \u2013 director, co-writer\n* [[Eiji Tsuburaya]] \u2013 special effects director\n* K\u014dji Kajita \u2013 assistant director\n* Teruo Maki \u2013 production manager\n* Choshiro Ishii \u2013 lighting\n* Takeo Kita \u2013 chief art director\n* Satoshi Chuko \u2013 art director\n* [[Akira Watanabe (art director)|Akira Watanabe]] \u2013 special effects art director\n* Kuichir\u014d Kishida \u2013 special effects lighting\n* Teiz\u014d Toshimitsu \u2013 monster builder\n* Hisashi Shimonaga \u2013 sound recording\n* Ichiro Minawa{{efn|Sometimes credited as '''Ichiro Mitsunawa'''.{{sfn|Ryfle|1998|p=351}}}} \u2013 sound and musical effects \n{{Div col end}}\nPersonnel taken from [[The Criterion Collection]].<ref name=\"Criterion\"/>\n\n===Development===\n{{quote box|quote=\"[If] our hearts were not in it 100 percent it would not have worked.

On the flight back to Japan, he conceived the idea for a giant monster film, inspired by the 1953 film ''[[The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms]]'' and the ''[[Daigo Fukury\u016b Maru]]'' incident that happened in March 1954.{{sfn|Ragone|2007|p=34}} The film's opening sequence is a direct reference to the incident.{{sfn|Ryfle|Godziszewski|2006|loc=00:02:08}} Tanaka felt the film had potential because nuclear fears were generating news and monster films were becoming popular, due to the financial success of ''The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms'' and the 1952 re-release of ''[[King Kong (1933 film)|King Kong]]'', the latter of which earned more money than previous releases.{{sfn|Ryfle|Godziszewski|2017|p=86}}\n\nDuring his flight, Tanaka wrote an outline with the working title {{nihongo|''The Giant Monster from 20,000 Miles Beneath the Sea''|\u5e95\u4e8c\u4e07\u54e9\u304b\u3089\u6765\u305f\u5927\u602a\u7363|Kaiteinimanmairu kara Kita Daikaij\u016b}} and pitched it to executive producer Iwao Mori. Mori approved the project in mid\u2013April 1954 after special effects director Eiji Tsuburaya agreed to do the film's effects and confirmed that the film was financially feasible.{{sfn|Ryfle|1998|p=21}} Mori also felt the project was perfect as a vehicle for Tsuburaya and to test the storyboarding system that he instituted at the time.{{sfn|Ragone|2007|p=34}} Mori also approved Tanaka's choice to have Ishir\u014d Honda direct the film and shortened the title of the production to ''Project G'' (G for Giant), as well as giving the production classified status and ordered Tanaka to minimize his attention on other films and mainly focus on ''Project G''.{{sfn|Ragone|2007|p=34}}{{sfn|Ryfle|1998|p=21}}\n\nToho originally intended for [[Senkichi Taniguchi]] to direct the film, as he was originally attached to direct ''In the Shadow of Glory''. However, Taniguchi declined the assignment.{{sfn|Ryfle|Godziszewski|2006|loc=00:05:50}} Honda was not Toho's first choice for the film's director, but his war-time experience made him an ideal candidate for the film's anti-nuclear themes.{{sfn|Ryfle|Godziszewski|2006|loc=00:06:05}} Several other directors passed on the project, feeling the idea was \"stupid\", but Honda accepted the assignment due to this interest in science and \"unusual things\", stating, \"I had no problem taking it seriously.\"{{sfn|Ryfle|Godziszewski|2017|p=86}} It was during the production of ''Godzilla'' that Honda worked with assistant director K\u014dji Kajita for the first time.{{sfn|Ryfle|Godziszewski|2017|p=84}} Afterwards, Kajita would go on to collaborate with Honda as his chief assistant director for 17 films over the course of 10 years.{{sfn|Ryfle|Godziszewski|2017|p=83}} Due to [[Science fiction film|sci-fi films]] lacking respect from film critics, Honda, Tanaka, and Tsuburaya agreed on depicting a monster attack as if it were a real event, with the serious tone of a documentary.{{sfn|Ryfle|Godziszewski|2017|p=85}}\n\n===Writing===\nTsuburaya submitted an outline of his own, written three years prior to ''Godzilla''; it featured a giant octopus attacking ships in the Indian Ocean.{{sfn|Ragone|2007|p=34}} In May 1954, Tanaka hired sci-fi writer Shigeru Kayama to write the story. Only 50 pages long and written in 11 days, Kayama's treatment depicted Dr. Yamane wearing dark shades, a cape and living in a European-style house from which he only emerged at night. Godzilla was portrayed as more animal-like by coming ashore to feed on animals, with an ostensibly gorilla-like interest in females. Kayama's story also featured less destruction and borrowed a scene from ''The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms'' by having Godzilla attack a lighthouse.{{sfn|Ryfle|1998|p=25}}{{sfn|Ragone|2007|p=34}}\n\nTakeo Murata and Honda co-wrote the screenplay in three weeks, confining themselves in a [[Ryokan (inn)|Japanese inn]] in Tokyo's [[Shibuya|Shibuya ward]]. On writing the script, Murata stated, \"Director Honda and I... racked our brains to make Mr. Kayama's original treatment into a full, working vision.\" Murata said that Tsuburaya and Tanaka pitched their ideas as well. Tanaka requested that they do not spend too much money, while Tsuburaya encouraged them to \"do whatever it takes to make it work\". Murata and Honda redeveloped key characters and elements by adding Emiko's love triangle. In Kayama's story, Serizawa was depicted as merely a colleague of Dr. Yamane's. Godzilla's full appearance was to be revealed during the Odo Island hurricane but Honda and Murata opted to show parts of the creature as the film built up to his full reveal. Honda and Murata also introduced the characters Hagiwara and Dr. Tanabe in their draft but the role of Shinkichi, who had a substantial role in Kayama's story, was cut down.{{sfn|Ryfle|1998|p=24\u201325}}\n\nA novelization, written by Kayama, was published on October 25, 1954, by Iwatani Bookstore as {{Nihongo|''Monster Godzilla''|\u602a\u7363\u30b4\u30b8\u30e9|''Kaij\u016b Gojira''}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://web2.nazca.co.jp/0107hop/data09.html|title=\u602a\u7363\u30b4\u30b8\u30e9\u30fb\u5c0f\u8aac|work=Nazca.co.jp|language=Japanese|access-date=December 30, 2021|url-status=dead|archive-date=December 30, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171226100858/http://web2.nazca.co.jp/0107hop/data09.html}}</ref>\n\n===Creature design===\n[[File:Godzilla '54 design.jpg|thumb|alt=Godzilla stands against an armada; used for marketing purposes.|The filmmakers took inspiration from various dinosaurs to shape Godzilla's final iconic design.]]\n\nGodzilla was designed by Teiz\u014d Toshimitsu and [[Akira Watanabe (art director)|Akira Watanabe]] under Eiji Tsuburaya's supervision.{{sfn|Ryfle|1998|p=27}} Early on, Tanaka contemplated having the monster be gorilla-like or whale-like in design, due to the name \"Gojira\" (a combination of the Japanese words for \"gorilla\", {{lang|ja|\u30b4\u30ea\u30e9}} {{transliteration|ja|gorira}}, and \"whale\", {{lang|ja|\u30af\u30b8\u30e9}} {{transliteration|ja|kujira}}), but eventually settled on a dinosaur-like design.{{sfn|Ryfle|1998|p=23}} Kazuyoshi Abe was hired earlier to design Godzilla but his ideas were later rejected due to Godzilla looking too humanoid and mammalian, with a head shaped like a mushroom cloud;{{sfn|Ryfle|1998|p=27}} however, Abe was retained to help draw the film's storyboards.{{sfn|Ragone|2007|p=38}}\n\nToshimitsu and Watanabe decided to base Godzilla's design on dinosaurs and, by using dinosaur books and magazines as a reference, combined elements of a [[Tyrannosaurus]], [[Iguanodon]] and the dorsal fins of a [[Stegosaurus]].{{sfn|Ryfle|1998|p=27}} Despite wanting to have utilized [[stop motion]] animation, Tsuburaya reluctantly settled on [[suitmation]].{{sfn|Ryfle|1998|p=27}} Toshimitsu sculpted three clay models on which the suit would be based. The first two were rejected but the third was approved by Tsuburaya, Tanaka, and Honda.{{sfn|Ryfle|1998|p=27}}\n\nThe Godzilla suit was constructed by Kanju Yagi, Yasuei Yagi, and Eizo Kaimai, who used thin bamboo sticks and wire to build a frame for the interior of the suit and added metal mesh and cushioning over it to bolster its structure and finally applied coats of latex.{{sfn|Ryfle|1998|p=27}} Coats of molten rubber were additionally applied, followed by carved indentations and strips of latex glued onto the surface of the suit to create Godzilla's scaly hide.{{sfn|Ryfle|1998|p=27}} This first version of the suit weighed 100 kilograms (220 pounds). For close-ups, Toshimitsu created a smaller scale, mechanical, hand-operated puppet that sprayed streams of mist from its mouth to act as Godzilla's atomic breath.{{sfn|Ragone|2007|p=39}}\n\n[[Haruo Nakajima]] and [[Katsumi Tezuka]] were chosen to perform in the Godzilla suit, due to their strength and endurance.{{sfn|Ryfle|1998|p=27}} At the first costume fitting, Nakajima fell down while inside the suit,{{sfn|Ryfle|1998|p=29}} due to the heavy latex and inflexible materials used to create the suit.{{sfn|Ryfle|1998|p=27}} This first version of the suit was cut in half and used for scenes requiring only partial shots of Godzilla or close-ups, with the lower-half fitted with rope suspenders for Nakajima to wear.{{sfn|Ryfle|1998|p=29}}{{sfn|Ragone|2007|p=39}} For full-body shots, a second identical suit was created which was made lighter than the first suit, but Nakajima was still only able to be inside for three minutes before passing out.{{sfn|Ryfle|1998|p=29}} Nakajima lost 20 pounds during the production of the film.{{sfn|Ragone|2007|p=42}} Nakajima would go on to portray Godzilla and other monsters until his retirement in 1972.{{sfn|Ryfle|1998|p=178}} Tezuka filmed scenes in the Godzilla suit but, due to his older body, he was unable to fully commit to the physical demands required by the role. As a result, few of his scenes made it to the final cut as very few scenes were considered usable.{{sfn|Kalat|2010|p=17}} Tezuka filled in for Nakajima when he was unavailable or needed relief from the physically demanding role.{{sfn|Ragone|2007|p=39}}\n\nGodzilla's name was also a source of consternation for the filmmakers. Because the monster had no name, the first draft of the film was not called ''Gojira'' but rather titled ''G'', also known as ''Kaihatsu keikaku G'' (\"''Development Plan G''\"), the \"G\" of the title stood for \"Giant\", however. Nakajima confirmed that Toho held a contest to name the monster.{{sfn|Ryfle|Godziszewski|2006|loc=00:24:43}} The monster was eventually named ''Gojira''.{{sfn|Lees|Cerasini|1998|p=12}} One explanation that is chalked up to legend is that a hulking Toho Studios employee's physical attributes led him to be nicknamed ''Gojira''.{{sfn|Lees|Cerasini|1998|p=12}} In a 1998 [[BBC]] documentary on Godzilla, Kimi Honda, the widow of the director, dismissed the employee-name story as a tall tale, believing that Honda, Tanaka, and Tsuburaya gave \"considerable thought\" to the name of the monster, stating, \"the backstage boys at Toho loved to joke around with tall stories, but I don't believe that one\".{{sfn|Ryfle|1998|p=23}} In 2003, a Japanese television special claimed to have identified the anonymous hulking Toho employee as Shiro Amikura, a Toho contract actor from the 1950s.{{sfn|Ryfle|Godziszewski|2006|loc=00:24:06}}\n\n===Special effects===\n[[File:Behind the Scenes of Godzilla 1954.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Effects assistants help suit performer Nakajima set up a crucial scene.|The Godzilla suit was produced with rough materials, which only granted suit-performer Haruo Nakajima three minutes in the suit before passing out from heat and exhaustion. The miniatures were constructed at certain scales to appear smaller than the Godzilla suit.]]\n\nThe film's special effects were directed by Eiji Tsuburaya.{{sfn|Kalat|2010|p=20}} In order for the effects footage to sync with the live-action footage, Honda and Tsuburaya would develop plans early during development and briefly meet prior to the day's shoot. Kajita would shuttle Tsuburaya to Honda's set to observe how a scene was being shot and where the actors were being positioned. Kajita also ushered Honda to the effects stage to observe how Tsuburaya was shooting certain effects. While Honda edited the live-action footage, he left blank [[Film leader|leaders]] for Tsuburaya to insert the effects footage. At times, Honda had to cut out certain effects footage. Tsuburaya disapproved of these decisions due to Honda's cuts not matching the effects; however, Honda had final say in these matters.{{sfn|Ryfle|Godziszewski|2017|p=88}}\n\nTsuburaya originally wanted to use stop motion for the film's special effects but realized it would have taken seven years to complete based on the then-current staff and infrastructure at Toho.{{sfn|Ragone|2007|p=35}} Settling on suitmation and miniature effects, Tsuburaya and his crew scouted the locations Godzilla was to destroy and were nearly arrested after a security guard overheard their plans for destruction but were released after showing police their Toho business cards.{{sfn|Ryfle|1998|p=29}} Kintaro Makino, the chief of miniature construction, was given blueprints by Akira Watanabe for the miniatures and assigned 30 to 40 workers from the carpentry department to build them, which took a month to build the scaled down version of [[Ginza]].{{sfn|Ryfle|1998|p=29}} A majority of the miniatures were built at 1:25 scale but the [[National Diet Building|Diet building]] was scaled down to a 1:33 scale to look smaller than Godzilla.{{sfn|Ryfle|1998|p=29}} While it proved to be too expensive to use stop-motion extensively throughout the picture, the final film did include a stop-motion scene of Godzilla's tail destroying the Nichigeki Theater building.<ref>{{cite web |last=Ryfle|first=Steve|url=https://www.scifijapan.com/godzilla-toho/godzilla-50th-anniversary-pressbook|title=GODZILLA 50th Anniversary Pressbook|publisher=SciFi Japan|access-date=October 23, 2021}}</ref>{{sfn|Ryfle|1998|p=26-27}}\n\nThe buildings' framework were made of thin wooden boards reinforced with a mixture of plaster and white chalk.{{sfn|Ryfle|1998|p=29}} Explosives were installed inside miniatures that were to be destroyed by Godzilla's atomic breath while some were sprayed with gasoline to make them burn more easily; others included small cracks so they could crumble easily.{{sfn|Ryfle|1998|p=29}} Optical animation techniques were used for Godzilla's glowing dorsal fins by having hundreds of cells drawn frame-by-frame.{{sfn|Ryfle|1998|p=30}} Haruo Nakajima perspired inside the suit so much that the Yagi brothers had to dry out the cotton lining every morning and sometimes re-line the interior of the suit and repair damages.{{sfn|Ryfle|1998|p=30}}\n\nThe typhoon waves were created by stagehands who overturned barrels of water into a water tank where the miniature Odo Island shoreline was built.{{sfn|Ryfle|Godziszewski|2006|loc=00:14:10}} Multiple composition shots were used for the Odo Island scenes.{{sfn|Ryfle|Godziszewski|2006|loc=00:17:56}} Most of the Odo Island scenes were filmed near rice fields.{{sfn|Ryfle|Godziszewski|2006|loc=00:18:11}} Toho hired en masse part-time employees to work on the film's optical effects.{{sfn|Ryfle|Godziszewski|2006|loc=00:18:20}} Half of the 400 hired staff were mostly part-timers with little to no experience.{{sfn|Ryfle|Godziszewski|2006|loc=00:18:28}} An early version of Godzilla's full reveal was filmed that featured Godzilla, via hand-operated puppet, devouring a cow. Sadamasa Arikawa thought the scene was too gruesome and convinced Tsuburaya to re-film it.{{sfn|Ryfle|Godziszewski|2006|loc=00:21:38}} Optical effects were utilized for Godzilla's footprints on the beach by painting them onto glass and inserting it onto an area of the live-action footage.{{sfn|Ryfle|Godziszewski|2006|loc=00:22:43}} Special effects photography lasted for 71 days.{{sfn|Ryfle|1998|p=30}}\n\n===Filming===\nOn the first day of filming, Honda addressed a crew of 30 to read the script and leave the project if they did not feel convinced, wanting only to work with those who had confidence in him and the film.{{sfn|Ryfle|Godziszewski|2017|p=84}} Most of the film was shot in the Toho lot.{{sfn|Ryfle|1998|p=31}} Honda's team also filmed on location in the [[Shima Peninsula]] in Mie Prefecture to film the Odo Island scenes, which used 50 Toho extras and Honda's team establishing their base in the town of Toba.{{sfn|Ryfle|1998|p=31}} Local villagers were also used as extras for the Odo Island scenes.{{sfn|Ryfle|Godziszewski|2006|loc=00:08:25}} The dance ritual scene was filmed on location in Mie Prefecture, with local villagers performing as the dancers.{{sfn|Ryfle|Godziszewski|2006|loc=00:11:21}} The cast and crew commuted every morning by boat to [[Toba, Mie]], working under harsh weather temperatures. Honda worked shirtless and as a result, suffered blistering sunburn on his back that left permanent scars.{{sfn|Ryfle|Godziszewski|2017|p=83}}\n\nToho had negotiated with the [[Japan Self-Defense Forces]] (JSDF) to film scenes requiring the military and filmed target practices and drills for the film; Honda's team followed a convoy of JSDF vehicles for the convoy dispatch scene.{{sfn|Ryfle|1998|p=31}} Two thousand girls were used from an all-girls high school for the prayer for peace scene.{{sfn|Ryfle|1998|p=31}} The filmmakers had little cooperation from the JSDF and had to rely on World War II stock footage, provided by the Japanese military, for certain scenes.{{sfn|Ryfle|Godziszewski|2006|loc=00:29:08}} The stock footage was sourced from 16mm prints.{{sfn|Ryfle|Godziszewski|2006|loc=00:29:31}} Honda's team spent 51 days shooting the film.{{sfn|Ryfle|1998|p=31}}\n\n==Music and sound effects==\nThe film's score was composed by Akira Ifukube. After meeting with Tanaka, Tsuburaya, and Honda, Ifukube enthusiastically accepted the job. After learning that the main character was a monster, Ifukube said, \"I couldn't sit still when I heard that in this movie the main character was a reptile that would be rampaging through the city.\" Ifukube was not shown the final film and only had a week to compose his music. Within that time, he was only shown a model of Godzilla and the screenplay. Tsuburaya briefly showed Ifukube some footage, albeit with the effects missing and Tsuburaya attempting to describe how the scene would unfold. Ifukube recalled, \"I was very confused. So I tried to make music that would remind you of something enormous.\" Ifukube used low-pitch brass and string instruments.{{sfn|Ryfle|1998|p=32}}\n\nIt was Honda's idea to make Godzilla roar, despite the fact that reptiles do not have vocal cords. Shimonaga and Minawa were originally tasked with creating the roar, but Ifukube became involved after taking interest in creating sound effects. Ifukube and Honda discussed what type of sounds were going to be used in certain scenes and other details concerning sounds. Minawa went to the zoo and recorded various animal roars and played them back at certain speeds. However, these sounds proved unsatisfactory and went unused. Ifukube borrowed a contrabass from the Japan Art University's music department and created Godzilla's roar by loosening the strings and rubbing them with a leather glove. The sound was recorded and played at a reduced speed, which achieved the effect of the roar used in the film. This technique would be adopted by Toho as a standard method in creating monster roars in the following years.{{sfn|Ryfle|1998|p=32}}\n\nThere are conflicting reports as to how Godzilla's footsteps were created. One claim states that the roar was created with a knotted rope hitting a kettle drum that was recorded and processed through an echo box. However, Ifukube told ''Cult Movies'' that the footsteps were created using a primitive amplifier that made a loud clap when struck. Some Japanese texts claim that the footsteps were sourced from an explosion with the ending clipped off and processed through an electronic reverb unit. The optical recording equipment contained four audio tracks: one for principal dialogue, one for background chatter, ambient noises, tanks, planes, and one for the roars and footsteps. An independent audio track was used to prevent bleeding over other audio.{{sfn|Ryfle|1998|p=32\u201333}}\n\nThe music and sound effects of Godzilla's rampage were recorded live simultaneously. While Ifukube conducted the NHK Philharmonic orchestra, a foley artists watched Godzilla's rampage projected on a screen and used tin, concrete debris, wood, and other equipment to simulate sounds that would sync with the footage. A new take would be needed if the foley artist had missed a cue.{{sfn|Ryfle|1998|p=33}} Many of Ifukube's themes and motifs associated with Godzilla were introduced in the film, such as the March, the Horror theme, and the Requiem. The \"Self Defense Force March\" had become synonymous with Godzilla that Ifukube later referred to it as \"[[Godzilla (Main Theme)|Godzilla's theme]].\" Ifukube considers his music for the film his finest film score.{{sfn|Ryfle|1998|p=49}}\n{{Infobox album\n| name       = Godzilla: Soundtrack Perfect Collection \u2013 Box 1\n| type       = [[Soundtrack]]\n| artist     = Akira Ifukube<ref name=\"OST\"/>\n| cover      = \n| alt        =\n| released   = September 20, 2004<ref name=\"OST\">{{cite web|url=https://www.tohokingdom.com/cd/gb1_godzilla54.htm|title=CD: Godzilla (Perfect Collection 1)|first=Anthony|last=Romero|work=Toho Kingdom |access-date=October 8, 2021|url-status=live|archive-date=October 8, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211009002217/https://www.tohokingdom.com/cd/gb1_godzilla54.htm}}</ref>\n| recorded   =\n| venue      =\n| studio     =\n| genre      = [[Soundtrack]], [[film score]]\n| length     = 46:23<ref name=\"OST\"/>\n| label      = Toho Music Corporation<ref name=\"OST\"/>\n| producer   =\n| prev_title =\n| prev_year  =\n| next_title =\n| next_year  =\n}}\n{{Tracklist\n| title1          = Main Title (M2 + M1)\n| length1         = 02:11\n| title2          = Sinking of ''Eikou-Maru'' (M3)\n| length2         = 01:10\n| title3          = Sinking of ''Bingou-Marou'' (M4)\n| length3         = 00:26\n| title4          = Anxieties on Ootojima Island (M5)\n| length4         = 00:52\n| title5          = Odo Island Temple Festival (M6)\n| length5         = 01:23\n| title6          = Storm on Odo Island (M7) \n| length6         = 01:57\n| title7          = Departure (Frigate March I) (M11)\n| length7         = 00:41\n| title8          = Theme for Odo Island (M9)\n| length8         = 00:35\n| title9          = Godzilla Appears on Odo Island (M10)\n| length9         = 00:54\n| title10         = Horror of the Water Tank (M13)\n| length10        = 00:46\n| title11         = Chaos in Shinagawa (M14 + M7-T1)\n| length11        = 01:49\n| title12         = Intercept Godzilla (M16)\n| length12        = 01:29\n| title13         = Godzilla Comes Ashore Again (M14)\n| length13        = 01:55\n| title14         = Godzilla's Rampage (MA')\n| length14        = 02:29\n| title15         = Desperate Broadcast (MB)\n| length15        = 01:16\n| title16         = Godzilla Comes to Tokyo Bay (MC)\n| length16        = 01:27\n| title17         = In Pursuit of Godzilla (M1)\n| length17        = 01:36\n| title18         = Tragic Sight of the Imperial Capital (M19)\n| length18        = 02:19\n| title19         = Oxygen Destroyer (M20)\n| length19        = 03:14\n| title20         = Prayer for Peace\n| length20        = 03:05\n| title21         = Frigate March II (M21)\n| length21        = 00:22\n| title22         = Godzilla at the Ocean Floor (M22)\n| length22        = 06:25\n| title23         = Ending (M23)\n| length23        = 01:47\n| title24         = Main Title \u00b7 Footsteps and Roaring (M2)\n| length24        = 02:14\n| title25         = Storm on Odo Island\n| length25        = 01:53\n| title26         = Pleasure Cruise Music\n| length26        = 01:14\n| title27         = Radio Music\n| length27        = 00:53\n| total_length = 46:23\n}}\n\n==Release==\n===Marketing===\nDuring production, Mori devised promotional strategies to generate public interest. Amongst these strategies was a radio play titled \n{{Nihongo|''Monster Godzilla''|\u602a\u7363\u30b4\u30b8\u30e9|Kaij\u016b Gojira|lead=no}}. 11 episodes were produced based on the screenplay, and aired on Saturdays on the [[NHK]] radio network from July 17, 1954, to September 25, 1954. In an attempt to build mystery, Mori banned reporters from the set, kept the special effects techniques and other behind the scenes crafts secret. Nakajima's suit performance as Godzilla would not be revealed until the 1960s. However, Godzilla's image was widely publicized. Godzilla's image was added to the company stationary, cut-out pictures and posters were displayed in theaters and stores, large advertisement balloons were flown to major Japanese cities, and a Godzilla doll was mounted onto a truck and driven around Tokyo. The film's theatrical trailer debuted in theaters on October 20, 1954.{{sfn|Ryfle|1998|p=33}}\n\n===Theatrical===\n''Godzilla'' was first released in [[Nagoya]] on October 27, 1954,{{sfn|Ryfle|Godziszewski|2017|p=103\u2013104}} and released nationwide on November 3, 1954.{{sfn|Galbraith IV|2008|p=106}} At the time of the film's release, it set a new opening day record for any Toho film, selling 33,000 tickets at Toho's cinemas in Tokyo and selling out at Nichigeki Theater. As a result, Toho's CEO personally called Honda to congratulate him. Honda's wife, Kimi, noted \"that sort of thing didn't usually happen.\"{{sfn|Ryfle|Godziszewski|2017|p=104}}\n\nFrom 1955 into the 1960s, ''Godzilla'' played in theaters catering to Japanese-Americans in predominantly Japanese neighborhoods in the United States.

It was this version of the original ''Godzilla'' film that introduced audiences worldwide to the character and franchise and the only version that critics and scholars had access to until 2004 when the 1954 film was released in select theaters in North America. ''Godzilla, King of the Monsters!'' grossed $2 million during its theatrical run, more than what the 1954 film grossed in Japan.{{sfn|Ryfle|Godziszewski|2017|p=106}}\n\nHonda was unaware that ''Godzilla'' had been re-edited until Toho released ''Godzilla, King of the Monsters!'' in Japan in May 1957 as ''Monster King Godzilla''.
