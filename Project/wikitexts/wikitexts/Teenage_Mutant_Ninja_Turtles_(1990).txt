It is the first [[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles in film|film adaptation of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]] and the first installment in the original trilogy. Directed by [[Steve Barron]] from a screenplay by [[Todd W. Langen]] and [[Bobby Herbeck]], it stars [[Judith Hoag]] and [[Elias Koteas]] with the voices of [[Brian Tochi]], [[Robbie Rist]], [[Corey Feldman]], and [[Josh Pais]]. The film follows the turtles on a quest to save their master, [[Splinter (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Splinter]], with their new allies, [[April O'Neil]] and [[Casey Jones (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Casey Jones]], from [[Shredder (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|the Shredder]] and his [[Foot Clan]].\n\nThe film is an adaptation of the early ''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (Mirage Studios)|Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]]'' comics, with several elements taken from the [[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (1987 TV series)|animated series]] airing at the time. The turtle costumes were developed by [[Jim Henson's Creature Shop]], one of [[Jim Henson]]'s last projects before his death shortly after the premiere.\n\nThe film was released theatrically in the United States on March 30, 1990, by [[New Line Cinema]]. It received mixed reviews from critics, but was a box-office success, grossing $202 million against a budget of $13.5 million, becoming the highest-grossing [[independent film]] up to that time<ref name=\"Couch\" /> (surpassed in 1999 by ''[[The Blair Witch Project]]'') and the [[1990 in film#Highest-grossing films|ninth highest-grossing film worldwide of 1990]].\n\nThe film was followed by two sequels, ''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II: The Secret of the Ooze]]'' (1991) and ''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles III]]'' (1993).\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- PER WP:FILMPLOT, PLOT SUMMARIES FOR FEATURE FILMS SHOULD BE 400-700 WORDS. -->In [[New York City]], television reporter [[April O'Neil]] is investigating a \"silent crime wave\" involving theft of various goods across the city. One night, while leaving the station, she is [[robbery|mugged]] by a group of thieves, but is saved by four [[anthropomorphic]] turtles: [[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]]\u2014[[Leonardo (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Leonardo]], [[Donatello (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Donatello]], [[Michelangelo (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Michelangelo]], and [[Raphael (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Raphael]]; the latter of which loses his [[sai (weapon)|sai]] in the fray, which April discovers and takes with her. The group returns to their secret Den in the sewers, and to their master; an anthropomorphic rat named [[Splinter (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Splinter]] who stresses the importance of being unseen. Upset after losing his weapon, Raph argues with Leonardo and storms out to a movie while the others enjoy pizza. Raph encounters a hockey-masked vigilante named [[Casey Jones (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Casey Jones]] accosting a pair of thugs in the park and intervenes due to Casey's more violent methods, but Casey escapes. \n\nApril earns the ire of Police Chief Sterns, blaming him for not following up on rumors of a group of thieves known as the \"[[Foot Clan]]\"; however a mysterious figure orders April silenced. Later that night, she is ambushed in the subway and knocked unconscious before Raphael reclaims his weapon and fights them off. Taking her back to their Den, he fails to realize he's being followed. When April awakens, she is introduced to the group and befriends them after learning their origins. They take April home, only to return to find their den demolished and Splinter missing. With nowhere else to go, they return to April's place.\n\nDanny Pennington, the son of April's boss Charles Pennington, is arrested for stealing. Using the boy as leverage, Chief Sterns coerces Charles to visit April and tell her to cease her investigation into the Foot; Danny catches a glimpse of Michelangelo in the apartment. On the way to school, Danny runs away from his father to the lair of the Foot Clan. When their leader [[Shredder (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|The Shredder]] announces their search for the Turtles, Danny reports his sighting. \n\nApril continues to antagonize Chief Sterns while the Turtles get used to their new living situation. Leonardo and Raphael get into a fight and Raph goes to the roof to cool off, while April takes the others on a tour of the thrift store in her building. Casey spots Raphael from an adjoining rooftop, before he is ambushed by dozens of Foot Clan members who beat him unconscious and throw him through the skylight. Joined by Casey, the remaining Turtles battle the Foot until the building catches fire, forcing them to retreat to April's abandoned family farm to recover; Leo is wracked with guilt over his prior argument with Raph and leaves to meditate, while Donatello and Casey bond over repairing an old truck. April also learns from Casey that she has been fired from her job. \n\nEventually Raph wakes from his coma and the four begin training together. Leo makes contact with Splinter through meditation and invites the others to join him; Splinter gives them a farewell speech, professing his love for his sons, which spurs the four to return to the city. Meanwhile, Danny meets Splinter at the Foot hideout and hears the story of how a violent ninja named Oroku Saki killed his master [[Hamato Yoshi]], realizing that Saki and Shredder are one and the same.\n\nUpon their return, the Turtles encounter Danny hiding out in their Den. Feeling [[claustrophobia|claustrophobic]] in the sewer, Casey goes to sleep in the truck on the street and spots Danny sneaking out after everyone has gone to sleep. He follows Danny to the Foot's hideout and confronts him. When Shredder orders Splinter's execution after learning of the Turtles' return, Danny and Casey rescue him, defeat Shredder's lieutenant Tatsu, and inspire a group of teens to leave with them. \n\nThe Foot Clan attacks the Turtles' hideout and are ambushed by them. The fight eventually spills into the streets, then up to a rooftop where they encounter Shredder, who defeats each of the Turtles easily. After pinning down Leonardo, Shredder threatens to kill him unless the other Turtles surrender their weapons. Although they give in to his demand, Shredder decides to kill Leonardo anyway, until Splinter confronts him, naming him as Oroku Saki. Shredder lunges at Splinter with a [[yari]], but Splinter dodges and throws him over the edge of the roof with Michelangelo's dropped [[nunchaku]], leaving him dangling over the city streets. He then throws a dagger at Splinter, which Splinter catches as he lets go of the nunchaku, dropping Shredder several stories into the back of a garbage truck; Casey then activates the compactor, crushing him. As the Foot are arrested and their hideout discovered, Danny reunites with his father, while April is rehired by Charles to provide exclusive coverage of the story. She urges Casey to kiss her as the Turtles cheer them on and exclaim their new victory cry of \"Cowabunga!\"\n\n==Cast==\n===Live action===\n* [[Judith Hoag]] as [[April O'Neil]], a reporter for Channel 3 News\n* [[Elias Koteas]] as [[Casey Jones (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Casey Jones]], a streetwise vigilante and former [[ice hockey]] player who becomes an ally of the turtles\n* [[Jay Patterson]] as Charles Pennington, April's boss\n* Michael Turney as Danny Pennington, Charles's teenage son\n* [[Raymond Serra]] as Sterns, the Chief of New York City Police Department\n* [[James Saito]] as [[Shredder (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Oroku Saki / The Shredder]], the leader of a network of runaways-turned-thieves and the main antagonist of the film\n* Toshishiro Obata as Master Tatsu, Shredder's second-in-command\n* [[Sam Rockwell]] as Head Thug, an unmasked gang member\n\n[[Skeet Ulrich]] and [[Scott Wolf]] appear as unnamed members of the Foot Clan, in uncredited roles.\n\n===Voice cast===\n* [[Brian Tochi]] as [[Leonardo (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Leonardo]], the leader of the Turtles and the closest to Splinter\n* [[Josh Pais]] as [[Raphael (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Raphael]], the rebellious and angry Turtle<ref name=\"Couch\" />\n* [[Corey Feldman]] as [[Donatello (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Donatello]], the brains of the Turtles<ref name=\"Couch\" />\n* [[Robbie Rist]] as [[Michelangelo (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Michelangelo]], the youngest Turtle, a fun-loving partier\n* [[Kevin Clash]] as [[Splinter (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Splinter]], the Turtles' master\n* David McCharen as Oroku Saki / The Shredder\n* [[Michael McConnohie]] as Master Tatsu\n\n===Puppeteers===\n* [[David Forman]] as Leonardo (in-suit performer)\n** [[Martin P.

Production designer Roy Forge Smith and his art director, Gary Wissner, went to New York City four months prior to filming and took still photographs of rooftops and other various locations. While in NYC, Smith and Wissner were allowed to explore an abandoned [[Brooklyn]] subway line, as they could not gain access to a city sewer, but the structure of the subway had the same principle as a sewer. They also went to a water tunnel which had large pipes running through it.<ref name=\"turtlesmain\">{{cite web|title=TMNT I|url=http://www.ninjaturtles.com/movies/movie1.htm|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060425163912/http://www.ninjaturtles.com/movies/movie1.htm|archive-date=April 25, 2006|access-date=September 24, 2006|work=ninjaturtles.com}}</ref>\n\nAfter design sketches were created, the construction team used the studios' backlot to create some of the sets. There were problems with the manholes that led to the turtles' home, in that an eight-foot square room had to be constructed beneath them, but found water at about five-feet, and thus had to pour concrete into the underground rooms to keep the water out. In order to make the sewer authentic, a tide-mark was given, and it was covered with brick, plaster and stucco paint to give the walls a realistic look.\n\nThe turtle costumes were created by [[Jim Henson's Creature Shop]] in London.<ref name=\"Couch\" /> [[Jim Henson]] said that the creatures were the most advanced that he had ever worked with.
