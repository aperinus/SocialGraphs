Chu]] from a screenplay by [[Ed Solomon]] and a story by Solomon and Peter Chiarelli. It serves as a sequel to 2013's ''[[Now You See Me (film)|Now You See Me]]'' and the second installment in the [[Now You See Me (film series)|''Now You See Me'' series]]. The film stars an [[ensemble cast]] that includes [[Jesse Eisenberg]], [[Mark Ruffalo]], [[Woody Harrelson]], [[Dave Franco]], [[Daniel Radcliffe]], [[Lizzy Caplan]], [[Jay Chou]], [[Sanaa Lathan]], [[Michael Caine]], and [[Morgan Freeman]]. The plot has the Four Horsemen and their leader Dylan Rhodes recruited by Walter Mabry, a criminal mastermind, to steal a data chip.\n\nOn July 3, 2013, the film was officially announced to be in development. Filming began in November 2014 and lasted until May 2015. The film was released on June 10, 2016, by [[Lionsgate Films|Lionsgate]].<ref name=\"Brew\">{{cite web|url=https://www.denofgeek.com/movies/now-you-see-me/26857/now-you-see-me-gets-a-sequel|title='Now You See Me' to get sequel|last=Brew|first=Simon|work=[[Den of Geek]]|date=August 13, 2013|access-date=September 10, 2014|archive-date=April 14, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160414111700/http://www.denofgeek.com/movies/now-you-see-me/26857/now-you-see-me-gets-a-sequel|url-status=dead}}</ref> It received mixed reviews from critics and grossed $334 million worldwide.\n\n==Plot==\n18 months after escaping the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]], the fugitive Four Horsemen \u2013 J. Daniel Atlas, Merritt McKinney, Jack Wilder, and new member Lula May \u2013 await orders from the Eye, the secret society of [[magic (illusion)|magicians]]. Their handler, FBI Special Agent Dylan Rhodes, delivers instructions: to expose corrupt tech CEO Owen Case, whose latest cell phone will secretly collect users' [[personal data]] to sell on the black market.\n\nIn [[New York City]], the Horsemen hijack the phone's launch but are interrupted by a mysterious figure who reveals to the public that Jack faked his death and that Dylan is working with the Horsemen. Dylan eludes the FBI as the Horsemen escape down a [[chute (gravity)#construction chute|construction chute]] only to find themselves in [[Macau]].\n\nThey are captured by Chase, Merritt's twin brother, and brought to Walter Mabry, Owen's former business partner. Having exposed the Horsemen in New York, Walter reveals how they were lulled unconscious and flown to Macau. Owen took his company from him, as well as a [[integrated circuit|chip]] designed by Walter to access any computer system in the world. Despite the protests of the other Horsemen, Daniel agrees to steal the chip for Walter before Owen can sell it. They acquire supplies from a [[magic store]] owned by Li and Bu Bu and arrange to deliver the chip to the Eye, knowing they cannot trust Walter. Posing as potential buyers, they infiltrate the [[Macau Science Center]], using [[cardistry]] and [[sleight of hand]] to sneak the chip past its supervisor, Allen Scott-Frank.\n\nDylan is contacted by Thaddeus Bradley, the magic [[debunker]] he framed for the Horsemen's crimes. He offers to help find the Horsemen, so he extricates him from prison. They go to Macau, and Dylan finds Daniel waiting to give the chip to the Eye. Walter arrives, having fooled Daniel into believing he was in contact with the Eye, and Dylan fights Walter's men as Daniel escapes with the chip. Captured, Dylan discovers Walter is the son of Arthur Tressler, whose fortune Dylan and the Horsemen stole. Walter and Arthur lock Dylan in a [[safe]] and drop him underwater, mirroring the death of Dylan's father.\n\nArthur pays Thaddeus for bringing him Dylan, and Thaddeus promises to deliver the Horsemen as well. Dylan escapes from the safe and is rescued by the Horsemen. Realizing the chip they have is a fake, they resolve to stop Walter from acquiring the real chip, and are joined by Li and Bu Bu.\n\nThe Horsemen announce new performance in [[London]], with an implicit threat to expose Walter, who flies to London with Arthur and Chase in a private jet. On [[New Year's Eve]], the Horsemen perform across the city, but they and Dylan are captured by Walter's men and brought to the jet. Once in the air, they are forced to hand over the fake chip, which Walter confirms is real, and his henchmen throw Dylan and the Horsemen out of the plane, supposedly to their deaths. However, Walter, Arthur, and Chase soon realize too late that they have never taken off, and that their jet is actually on a set floating on the [[Thames]].\n\nThe Horsemen and Dylan explain how they had misled the three into thinking they had won and reveal Jack had hypnotized Chase into throwing them out of the plane as planned. Walter, Arthur, and Chase's misdeeds are broadcast to the crowd and around the world, and they are taken into FBI custody as Dylan and the Horsemen escape before the FBI can apprehend them. They arrive at the [[Royal Observatory, Greenwich|Greenwich Observatory]], where they meet other members of the Eye, including Li, Bu Bu, and Allen. Their leader is revealed to be Thaddeus, who explains to Dylan that he was his father's partner in magic and was pretending to be his rival this whole time. He appoints Dylan the new leader, and the Horsemen are shown a secret entrance to see more of the Eye.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Jesse Eisenberg]] as J. Daniel Atlas.
