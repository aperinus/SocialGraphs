It follows a platoon of [[German Army (Wehrmacht)|German Army]] soldiers transferred to the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]] of [[World War II]], where they find themselves fighting in the [[Battle of Stalingrad]].\n\nThe film is the second German movie to portray the Battle of Stalingrad. It was predated by the 1959 ''[[Stalingrad: Dogs, Do You Want to Live Forever?|Hunde, wollt ihr ewig leben]]'' (''Stalingrad: Dogs, Do You Want to Live Forever?'').\n\n==Plot==\nIn August 1942, German soldiers enjoy leave in [[Cervo, Liguria]], [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]], after fighting at the [[First Battle of El Alamein]], where ''[[Unteroffizier]]'' Manfred \"Rollo\" Rohleder and ''[[Obergefreiter]]'' Fritz Reiser are introduced to ''[[Leutnant]]'' Hans von Witzland, their new platoon commander. Their unit is promptly sent to the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]] to fight in the [[Battle of Stalingrad]].\n\nWitzland's platoon joins a company commanded by ''[[Hauptmann]]'' Hermann Musk. Musk leads an assault on a factory, which results in heavy casualties. Later, Witzland requests a ceasefire with the Soviets so both sides can collect their wounded, which they agree to. M\u00fcller (called \"HGM\" to distinguish him from other M\u00fcllers) breaks the ceasefire, much to the anger of Witzland and Reiser; the latter angrily assaults him.\n\nWitzland's platoon is surrounded in a decrepit building. During a Soviet attack, Witzland, Reiser, Rollo, Emigholtz, and \"GeGe\" M\u00fcller go down to secure the sewers. Witzland gets separated from the others and captures a female Soviet soldier named Irina; she offers to lead him to safety, but instead pushes him into the water and escapes. His men rescue him, and Emigholtz is found severely wounded by an explosive trap, his right leg hastily having to be amputated by the men; they take him to a crowded aid station, where they grab a doctor at gunpoint to treat Emigholtz, who nonetheless dies. They are then arrested by '' Hauptmann'' Haller, who has previously clashed with Witzland regarding the treatment of Soviet prisoners. They are assigned to a [[Strafbattalion|penal battalion]], disarming land mines.\n\nFour weeks later, a brutal winter has set in and the [[Operation Uranus|Soviets have surrounded]] the German [[Sixth Army (Wehrmacht)|Sixth Army]]. ''Hauptmann'' Musk thus reassigns the penal battalion\u2014which includes disgraced fellow officer Otto\u2014to combat duty, after the men threaten to mutiny unless their crimes are pardoned. Witzland's platoon defends a position from a Soviet tank column, and emerge victorious after a bloody battle. ''Hauptmann'' Haller later orders von Witzland and his men to execute some unarmed civilians, much to their reluctance.\n\nWitzland, GeGe, and Reiser decide to desert and head towards [[Pitomnik Airfield]] in hopes of catching a plane back to Germany, stealing medical tags from some dead bodies along the way to feign being wounded. By the time they arrive, the last transport has left. They rejoin the others in the shelter, where they find Musk suffering from severe [[trench foot]]. While the men recover a German supply drop, Haller appears and holds them at gunpoint, but is quickly subdued; he accidentally shoots GeGe as he falls, killing him. Haller then pleads for his life, telling them about the supplies he is hoarding in a nearby house before being executed by Otto.\n\nIn the house's cellar they find shelves stocked full of food and liquor, and Irina tied to a bed. Witzland cuts Irina free. As the rest of the men gorge themselves, a deluded and dying Musk tries to rally them to rejoin the fighting. Otto becomes hysterical and commits suicide. Rollo carries Musk outside, only to find the Sixth Army surrendering to the Soviets. Musk succumbs to the elements upon Rollo being instructed to surrender.\n\nIrina offers to help Witzland and Reiser get away, but while trudging through the snow they are shot at by the Soviets; Irina is killed and Witzland wounded. The two Germans get away, but Witzland eventually becomes too weak and dies in Reiser's arms. Reiser cradles his body and freezes to death.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Dominique Horwitz]] as [[Obergefreiter]] Fritz Reiser\n* [[Thomas Kretschmann]] as [[Leutnant]] Hans von Witzland\n* [[Jochen Nickel]] as [[Unteroffizier]] Manfred \"Rollo\" Rohleder\n* Sebastian Rudolph as [[Soldat (rank)]] \"GeGe\" M\u00fcller (nicknamed GeGe to distinguish him from other M\u00fcllers)\n* [[Dana V\u00e1vrov\u00e1]] as Irina\n* [[Martin Benrath]] as [[Generalmajor]] Hentz (based on [[Generaloberst]] [[Walter Heitz]])\n* [[Sylvester Groth]] as Unteroffizier Otto (formerly a [[Officer (armed forces)|commissioned officer]])\n* [[Karel He\u0159m\u00e1nek]] as [[Hauptmann]] Hermann Musk\n* [[Heinz Emigholz]] as Funker (Radioman) Edgar Emigholz\n* Ferdinand Schuster as Double Edgar\n* [[Oliver Broumis]] as Soldat M\u00fcller (HGM)\n* Dieter Okras as Hauptmann Haller\n* Zden\u011bk Vencl as [[Gefreiter]] W\u00f6lk\n* Mark Kuhn as [[Feldwebel]] Pfl\u00fcger\n* Thorsten Bolloff as Soldat Feldmann\n* Alexander Wachholz as [[Military Chaplain|Pfarrer]] Renner\n* J.
