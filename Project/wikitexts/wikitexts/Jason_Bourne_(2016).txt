It is the fifth installment of the [[Bourne (film series)|''Bourne'' film series]] and a direct [[sequel]] to ''[[The Bourne Ultimatum (film)|The Bourne Ultimatum]]'' (2007). [[Matt Damon]] reprises his role as the main character, former [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] [[assassin]] [[Jason Bourne]]. In addition, the film stars [[Tommy Lee Jones]], [[Alicia Vikander]], [[Julia Stiles]], [[Vincent Cassel]], [[Riz Ahmed]], [[Ato Essandoh]], and [[Scott Shepherd (actor)|Scott Shepherd]].\n\nThe character Aaron Cross, from ''[[The Bourne Legacy (film)|The Bourne Legacy]]'' (2012), does not appear in the film because director Greengrass wanted to focus on the title character, and because actor [[Jeremy Renner]] was unable to participate due to scheduling conflicts. In ''Jason Bourne'', Bourne remains on the run from CIA hit squads as he tries to uncover hidden truths about his father, while [[CIA director]] Robert Dewey (Jones) orders the head of cyber-security Heather Lee (Vikander) to hunt him down. [[Principal photography]] on the film commenced on September 8, 2015.\n\n''Jason Bourne'' premiered in [[London]] on July 11, 2016, and was theatrically released in the U.S. by [[Universal Pictures]] on July 29, 2016. A 3D version was also released in limited Asian countries, namely China, India, the Philippines, and Vietnam.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/3d-jason-bourne-causes-nausea-923098|title=3D 'Jason Bourne' Causes Nausea, Protest in China|website=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=August 26, 2016 |access-date=26 August 2016|archive-date=August 26, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160826220708/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/3d-jason-bourne-causes-nausea-923098|url-status=live}}</ref> The film received mixed reviews and grossed $415 million worldwide.\n\n==Plot==\nTwelve years after [[The Bourne Ultimatum (film)|he exposed Operation Blackbriar]] and disappeared, ex-[[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] Agent and ex-[[Treadstone Seventy-One|Treadstone]] operative [[Jason Bourne]] has finally recovered from his amnesia, isolating himself from the world and making a living as a [[Street fighting|street fighter]] in Greece. In [[Reykjav\u00edk]], Treadstone technician Nicky Parsons, who has been collaborating with a [[hacktivism|hacktivist group]] led by Christian Dassault, hacks into the CIA's mainframe computer server to expose its black ops programs. In the process, Parsons finds documentation concerning Bourne's recruitment into Treadstone and his father's role in the program. She travels to [[Athens]] to find and inform him. \n\nParson's information breach alerts Heather Lee, the CIA\u2019s [[cybersecurity]] operations division head, and [[Director of the Central Intelligence Agency|CIA Director]] Robert Dewey. They send CIA teams after Bourne and Parsons, who have arranged to meet in Greece at [[Syntagma Square]] during a violent anti-government protest. Dewey also sends the Asset, an ex-Blackbriar operative who holds a personal grudge against Bourne for having been captured and tortured in [[Syria]] as an unintentional consequence of Bourne's exposure of Blackbriar. Parsons is shot by the Asset, and passes Bourne the key to a locker which holds the CIA files before dying.\n\nSeeking answers about his past and family, Bourne locates Dassault in [[Berlin]]. Decrypting Parsons's files, Bourne discovers that his father Richard Webb was a CIA analyst involved in the creation of the Treadstone program. A [[malware]] program implanted in the files gives the CIA Bourne's location, and Dewey sends a team to capture him, while Lee remotely erases the files. Dassault attacks Bourne, but is incapacitated. Lee alerts Bourne to the team closing in, as she believes that he can be persuaded to return to the agency after seeing Bourne's behaviour report. Using the few leads he gathered in Berlin, Bourne tracks Malcolm Smith, an ex-Treadstone surveillance operative, in [[London]] and arranges to meet him in Paddington Plaza.\n\nLee persuades Dewey's boss, Edwin Russell, the [[Director of National Intelligence|National Intelligence Director]], to allow her to contact Bourne in person to attempt to bring him back in. Dewey, who opposes her plan, secretly instructs the Asset to eliminate her team and kill Bourne. Bourne confronts Smith, who confesses that Webb was not just an analyst for Treadstone but played a significant role in creating it. When he found out that the agency was trying to recruit his son, he threatened to expose the program as he did not want his son to become one of their assassins. The Asset killed Webb under Dewey's orders in [[Beirut]], framing it as a terrorist attack to incentivize Bourne to join Treadstone. The Asset interrupts and kills Smith, but Bourne escapes. He locates Lee, who admits she is uncomfortable with Dewey's methods and directs Bourne to a technology convention in [[Las Vegas]].\n\nDewey is scheduled to attend the convention for a public debate on privacy rights with Aaron Kalloor, CEO of [[social media]] giant Deep Dream. Kalloor is the public face of [[corporate social responsibility]] in the Internet age, but he was secretly funded by Dewey in the startup stage. Dewey intends to use Deep Dream for real-time [[mass surveillance]] alongside the latest incarnation of the CIA's targeted assassination \"Beta\" program, known as \"Iron Hand\", a much more ruthless and sinister version of Blackbriar in which the assassin can intentionally murder anyone to get to the target. When Kalloor has second thoughts about giving the CIA access to Deep Dream, Dewey authorizes the Asset to assassinate Kalloor and Lee, having discovered that she let Bourne pass through immigration. Bourne thwarts the assassinations and confronts Dewey in his suite. Dewey attempts to stage an ambush, but is killed by Lee. Bourne pursues the Asset on the [[Las Vegas Strip]], and the pair ends up crashing into the [[Riviera (hotel and casino)|Riviera]] casino. Bourne chases the Asset down into the sewers and engage in a savage fight that ends with Bourne snapping the Asset's neck, killing him.\n\nIn the aftermath, Lee, whose involvement in Dewey's death was covered, convinces Russell that Dewey's methods were outdated and offers herself as Dewey's replacement as CIA director and Russell's eyes and ears within the CIA. She outlines her plan to use Bourne's trust to bring him back to the agency, but is prepared to kill him if he refuses. Lee meets with Bourne, who says he will consider the offer. Lee returns only to realize Bourne had her and Russell's conversation recorded, indicating he was aware of her true intentions with him, before he disappears again.\n\n==Cast==\n{{multiple image|total_width=270|image1=Matt Damon TIFF 2015.jpg |image2=Julia Stiles by David Shankbone cropped.jpg |footer=[[Matt Damon]] and [[Julia Stiles]] reprised their roles from the original trilogy of films.}}\n* [[Matt Damon]] as David Webb / [[Jason Bourne]], a former CIA assassin who disappeared after publicizing details of the CIA's targeted assassination programs.\n* [[Tommy Lee Jones]] as Robert Dewey, the current director of the CIA and leader of the Iron Hand program who intends to take down Bourne after the exposure of Blackbriar\n* [[Julia Stiles]] as Nicolette \"Nicky\" Parsons, Bourne's former Treadstone contact in [[Paris]].\n* [[Alicia Vikander]] as Heather Lee, head of the CIA Cyber Ops Division.\n* [[Vincent Cassel]] as The Asset, a Blackbriar assassin working for the Iron Hand program.

So all of that internal propulsive mechanism that drives the character is not there, so if there was to be another one, then it would have to be a complete reconfiguration, you know. Where do you go from there? For me, I kind of feel like the story that we set out to tell has now been told. I love the character, and if Paul Greengrass calls me in ten years and says, 'Now we can do it, because it's been ten years and I have a way to bring him back,' then there's a world in which I can go, 'Yeah, absolutely.'
