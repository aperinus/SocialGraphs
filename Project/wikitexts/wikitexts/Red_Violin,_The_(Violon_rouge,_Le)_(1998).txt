Jackson]], [[Carlo Cecchi]] and [[Sylvia Chang]]. It spans four centuries and five countries as it tells the story of a mysterious red-coloured [[violin]] and its many owners. The instrument, made in [[Cremona]] in 1681 with a future forecast by [[tarot]] cards, makes its way to Montreal in 1997, where an appraiser identifies it and it goes to auction. The film was an [[international co-production]] among companies in Canada, Italy, and the United Kingdom.\n\nThe screenplay was written by [[Don McKellar]], who also acts, and Girard, inspired by a historic 1720 [[List of Stradivarius instruments|Stradivarius violin]] nicknamed the \"Red Mendelssohn\". The film was shot in Austria, Canada, China, England and Italy and features a [[The Red Violin (soundtrack)|soundtrack]] by [[John Corigliano]], with solos performed by violinist [[Joshua Bell]].\n\nAfter premiering in the [[1998 Venice Film Festival|Venice Film Festival]], it received some positive reviews from critics and grossed $10 million in the U.S. box office. It received numerous honours, including the [[Academy Award for Best Original Score]] and eight [[19th Genie Awards|Genie Awards]], including [[Canadian Screen Award for Best Motion Picture|Best Motion Picture]]. The film also nominated for [[Golden Globe Award|Golden Globe]] for [[Golden Globe Award for Best Foreign Language Film|Best Foreign Language Film]], but lost to ''[[All About My Mother]]''.\n\n==Plot==\n[[File:Jean Dodal Tarot trump 18.jpg|thumbnail|100px|left|[[The Moon (Tarot card)|The Moon]] tarot card]] '''Cremona, 1681''' ''(<small>Language: Italian</small>)''\n\nNicol\u00f2 Bussotti is a [[Luthier|violin-maker]] whose wife, Anna Rudolfi, is pregnant. Anna asks her servant Cesca to foretell her unborn child's future. Cesca cannot determine the future of someone not born, but she does offer to read Anna's future using [[tarot]] cards. The first, [[The Moon (Tarot card)|The Moon]], signifies that Anna will live a long life.\n\nIn the meantime, Nicol\u00f2 has fashioned a new violin. He is about to [[Varnish#Violin|varnish]] it when he finds that both she and the child have died. Distraught, Nicol\u00f2 returns to his shop and varnishes the violin with a red color. The violin, the last one that Nicol\u00f2 ever made, then makes its way to an [[orphanage]] in Austria.\n\n[[File:Jean Dodal Tarot trump 12.jpg|thumbnail|100px|left|[[The Hanged Man (tarot card)|The Hanged Man]] tarot card]] '''Vienna, 1793''' ''(<small>Language: German and French</small>)''\n\nCesca turns over the second card, [[The Hanged Man (tarot card)|The Hanged Man]], which means disease and suffering for those around Anna.\n\nAt the orphanage, the violin comes into the possession of Kaspar Weiss, a young but brilliant violin [[child prodigy|prodigy]]. The monks at the orphanage ask a violin instructor, Poussin, to adopt the boy to further his development. Poussin brings Weiss and the violin to [[Vienna]]. They learn that Prince Mannsfeld is visiting Vienna and is looking for a prodigy to accompany him back to [[Prussia]], promising a generous reward. Poussin puts Weiss through a strict practice regimen. However, the regimen and the \"Poussin Meter\" (a primitive [[metronome]]) take a toll on Weiss' [[heart defect]]. On the day of the recital, as he starts playing, Weiss's heart gives out from the stress and he collapses, dead.\n\nWeiss is buried at the orphanage he grew up in. When Poussin inquires about the violin, the monks explain that they buried it with Weiss. The violin is later stolen by [[grave robbers]] travelling in a [[Romani people|gypsy]] procession, who take it to England.\n\n'''Oxford, late 1890s''' ''(<small>Language: English and [[Romani language|Romani]]</small>)''\n[[File:Jean Dodal Tarot trump 15.jpg|thumbnail|100px|right|[[The Devil (Tarot card)|The Devil]] tarot card]]\n\nCesca's third card is [[The Devil (Tarot card)|The Devil]] and she explains that Anna will meet a handsome and intelligent man who will seduce her.\n\nLord Frederick Pope comes across the gypsy procession setting up camp on his estate, as a gypsy woman plays the violin. He offers his hospitality in exchange for the violin. Frederick finds great praise in his public concerts with the violin as well as his compositions, with his lover Victoria Byrd serving as his carnal [[muse]]. Victoria, a writer, announces to Frederick that she needs to travel to [[History of Russia (1892\u20131917)|Russia]] to research a novel she is working on.\n\nWhile Victoria is absent, Frederick loses his inspiration to compose and degenerates. When Victoria does not receive his letters for a full week, she resolves to return immediately. But when she arrives, she finds him in the arms of a new muse, the gypsy violinist woman. In a moment of rage, Victoria shoots the violin, grazing its neck and detaching its strings and [[tailpiece]], before storming out.\n\nFrederick's final letter to Victoria states that he will be committing suicide and that he is leaving his entire estate to her. The violin ends up in the hands of Frederick's Chinese servant, who returns to [[Shanghai]] and sells it to an antiques dealer, who repairs the damage. The instrument is sold to a young woman with her daughter during the 1930s.\n\n[[File:Jean Dodal Tarot trump 08.jpg|thumbnail|100px|left|[[Justice (Tarot card)|Justice]] tarot card]]\n'''Shanghai, late 1960s''' ''(<small>Language: Mandarin</small>)''\n\nCesca predicts the fourth card, [[Justice (Tarot card)|Justice]], means tough times ahead, featuring a trial and persecution, where Anna shall be guilty.\n\nIn the chaos of China's [[Cultural Revolution]], any ideas or items deemed \"bourgeois\" are denounced and should be destroyed. One target for public denunciation and [[Self-criticism#In Communist movements|self-criticism]] is a music teacher named Zhou Yuan, who is berated for his fondness for [[classical music|Western classical music]]. A [[Political officer (military)|political officer]], Xiang Pei, successfully defends Zhou. Xiang then returns to her residence and retrieves the Red Violin, given as a gift from her mother. Several [[Red Guards (China)|Red Guards]] raid Xiang's apartment after learning of its existence, finding nothing.\n\nXiang arrives at Zhou's house and pleads with him to take the violin to keep it safe. He relents and vows to keep it hidden, while Xiang leaves to face possible prosecution from Communist Party officials. Years later, Chinese police enter Zhou's home to find his dead body amid a \"sanctuary\" of dozens of musical instruments. Upon this discovery, the present-day [[Government of the People's Republic of China|Chinese government]] ships these items to [[Montreal]] for appraisal and sale at auction.\n\n[[File:Jean Dodal Tarot trump 13 upside down.jpg|thumbnail|100px|right|The upside-down [[Death (Tarot card)|Death]] tarot card]]\n'''Montr\u00e9al, 1997''' ''(<small>Language: English and French</small>)''\n\nThe final card, [[Death (Tarot card)|Death]], Cesca sees not as predicting death, but, due to its upside-down positioning, as [[reincarnation|rebirth]].\n\nCharles Morritz arrives in Montreal as an [[appraiser]] for the violins sent by the Chinese government. Almost immediately, he notices the Red Violin and believes it may be the legendary last violin of Nicol\u00f2 Bussotti. He has restorer Evan Williams perform some work on it, while sending samples of the varnish to a lab at the [[University of Montreal]]. At the same time, he purchases a copy of the Red Violin from a private collection in London, the closest copy to the original available.\n\nWhen the results of the varnish tests arrive, Morritz is shocked to learn that the violin's varnish contains human blood. Nicol\u00f2 had carried his wife's body to his shop after her death and slit her wrist to collect blood for making the red varnish. He admits to the auction manager, Leroux, that it is the Red Violin.\n\nAs he prepares to fly home, Morritz stops by the auction house \"Duval's\", with the London copy in hand. As the auction for the previous lot ends, Morritz switches the Red Violin for the London copy, which is sold for $2.4 million. Morritz calls his wife at home in New York City and asks to speak to his daughter, telling her he has a special present for her upon his return.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Jean-Luc Bideau Cannes 2009.jpg|150px|thumb|[[Jean-Luc Bideau]] has a prominent role in the Vienna scenes.]]\n'''Cremona'''\n*[[Carlo Cecchi]] \u2013 Nicol\u00f2 Bussotti\n*Irene Grazioli \u2013 Anna Rudolfi Bussotti\n*Anita Laurenzi \u2013 Cesca\n*Samuele Amighetti \u2013 Boy\n\n'''Vienna'''\n*[[Christoph Koncz]] \u2013 Kaspar Weiss\n*[[Jean-Luc Bideau]] \u2013 Georges Poussin\n*[[Clotilde Mollet]] \u2013 Antoinette Poussin\n*Arthur Denberg \u2013 Prince Mannsfeld\n\n'''Oxford'''\n{{multiple image\n | align     = right\n | direction = horizontal\n | footer    = [[Greta Scacchi]] and [[Sylvia Chang]] star in the Oxford and Shanghai segments, respectively.\n | footer_align = left\n | width     =\n | image1    = Greta Scacchi Cannes.jpg\n | width1    = 130\n | alt1      = \n | image2    = Sylvia Chang 2011 (cropped).jpg\n | width2    = 151\n | alt2      = \n}}\n*[[Jason Flemyng]] \u2013 Frederick Pope\n*[[Greta Scacchi]] \u2013 Victoria Byrd\n*Eva Marie Bryer \u2013 Sara\n*[[Joshua Bell]] \u2013 Orchestra member: First violin (cameo)\n\n'''Shanghai'''\n*[[Sylvia Chang]] \u2013 Xiang Pei (& Xiang Pei's mother)\n*[[Tao Hong (actress, born 1972)|Tao Hong]] \u2013 Chen Gang\n*Liu Zifeng \u2013 Zhou Yuan\n*Han Xiaofei \u2013 Ming\n*[[Wang Xiaoshuai]] \u2013 one of the four police officers (cameo)\n\n'''Montreal'''\n{{multiple image\n | align     = right\n | direction = horizontal\n | footer    = [[Samuel L.
