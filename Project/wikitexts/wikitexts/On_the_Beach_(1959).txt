The only habitable areas are in the far reaches of the [[Southern Hemisphere]], but air currents are slowly carrying the fallout south.\n\nAustralian survivors detect an incomprehensible [[Morse code]] signal coming from the West Coast of the United States. The American [[nuclear submarine]] USS ''Sawfish'', now under [[Royal Australian Navy]] command, is ordered to sail north to locate the source of the signal. The submarine is commanded by Capt. Dwight Towers, who leaves behind a new friend, Moira Davidson.\n\nA scientific theory postulates the radiation levels near the [[Arctic Ocean]] are lower than the mid-Northern Hemisphere, possibly indicating the radiation could disperse before reaching the Southern Hemisphere. Arriving at [[Point Barrow|Point Barrow, Alaska]], the submarine discovers radiation levels are inexplicably intensifying.\n\n''Sawfish'' arrives in the [[San Francisco]] Bay area; the crew finds a city devoid of any signs of life. Ralph Swain, a crewman with family in San Francisco, deserts the submarine and swims ashore. Scientist Julian Osborn informs Capt. Towers that Swain's contact with the radioactive environment will quickly make it impossible for him to return without killing everyone aboard.\n\nThe next morning, through the periscope, Capt. Towers observes Swain fishing in the bay. He apologizes for deserting, explaining he preferred to die in his hometown. Towers understands, bids him farewell, and departs for [[San Diego]].\n\nNear San Diego, communications officer Lt. Sunderstrom goes ashore wearing radiation and oxygen gear to search for the source of the signals. He has just one hour, and is alerted by a horn blast from ''Sawfish'' every 15 minutes, and must return immediately upon hearing the third horn blast. At an electric station running on automatic control, he finds the telegraph, and discovers a tilted soda-pop bottle hanging by its neck from an open window shade's pull cord; random ocean breezes bump the bottle against the live [[telegraph key]], sending out random signals. Sunderstrom uses Morse code to send a message, describing the bleak situation. Before returning to ''Sawfish'', Sunderstrom shuts down the power station's generators.\n\n''Sawfish'' crew returns to Australia to enjoy what pleasures remain. While reuniting with Moira at her father's farm, Towers hears all US Navy personnel stationed at their base in [[Brisbane]] are dead. Towers is promoted to Admiral of the remaining US Navy personnel in Australia. Osborn wins the [[Australian Grand Prix]] in which many racers, with nothing left to lose, die in various crashes.\n\nWith the fishing season starting sooner than normal, Towers and Moira begin a fishing trip. At a country stream, drunken revelers surround them. From their resort room, they can hear more boozy fishermen singing a version of \"[[Waltzing Matilda]]\". Towers and Moira share a romantic interlude, while outside a gathering storm howls. The fishermen sing an [[a capella]] rendition of the song's foreboding final verse.\n\nReturning to [[Melbourne]], Towers learns one of his crew, Sunderstrom, who investigated the signal in San Diego, has radiation sickness, meaning the deadly radiation has arrived. Osborn closes himself in a sealed garage with his championship racing car, electing to die from [[carbon monoxide poisoning]] as he revs the engine. Others queue to receive suicide pills issued by agents of the Australian government.\n\nTowers wants to stay with Moira, but many of his remaining crew want to head for home to die in the US; he chooses his duty over his love for Moira, joining his crew as they attempt to make it back to a radioactive America. Moira watches ''Sawfish'' leave Australia and submerge for the final voyage home.\n\nWithin a few days, the last pockets of survivors in Melbourne are dead. The empty windblown streets of Melbourne are punctuated by the rise of dramatic, strident music over a single powerful image of a previously seen [[The Salvation Army|Salvation Army]] street banner: \"There is still time .. <!-- The banner has just two dots -->Brother\".\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Gregory Peck]] as Commander Dwight Lionel Towers, USS ''Sawfish''\n* [[Ava Gardner]] as Moira Davidson, Towers' Australian love interest\n* [[Fred Astaire]] as Julian Osborn, Australian scientist\n* [[Anthony Perkins]] as Lieutenant Commander Peter Holmes, Royal Australian Navy\n* [[Donna Anderson]] as Mary Holmes, Peter's wife\n* [[John Tate (actor)|John Tate]] as Admiral Bridie, Royal Australian Navy\n* [[Harp McGuire]] as Lieutenant Sunderstrom (ashore in San Diego)\n* [[Lola Brooks (actor)|Lola Brooks]] as Lieutenant Hosgood, Bridie's secretary\n* [[Ken Wayne]] as Lieutenant Benson\n* [[Guy Doleman]] as Lieutenant Commander Farrel\n* [[Richard Meikle]] as Davis\n* [[John Meillon]] as ''Sawfish'' crewman Ralph Swain (ashore in San Francisco)\n* [[Joe McCormick (actor)|Joe McCormick]] as Ackerman, radiation sickness victim\n* [[Lou Vernon]] as Bill Davidson, Moira's father\n* [[Kevin Brennan (actor)|Kevin Brennan]] as Dr. King, radiation diagnosis doctor\n* Keith Eden as Dr. Fletcher (beach scene)\n* Basil Buller-Murphy as Sir Douglas Froude\n* [[Brian James (actor)|Brian James]] as Royal Australian Navy officer\n* John Casson as Salvation Army captain\n* Paddy Moran as Stevens (club wine steward)\n* [[Grant Taylor (actor)|Grant Taylor]] as Morgan (Holmes party)\n* George Fairfax (Holmes party guest)\n* Earl Francis (Holmes party guest)\n* Pat Port (Runner on Beach)\n* Cary Peck (uncredited){{#tag:ref|Gregory Peck's son, Cary, had a cameo in the film.<ref name=\"Mitchell182\">Mitchell 2001, p. 182.</ref>|group=Note}}\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\nAs in the novel, much of ''On the Beach'' takes place in [[Melbourne]], close to the southernmost part of the Australian mainland.

Afterwards, Egypt used Soviet built aircraft to make nuclear bombings on the United States and the United Kingdom, which, in turn, provoked the US and NATO to launch retaliation attacks against the Soviet Union, thus triggering the slow and painful death of the human race as the radiation from the attacks began to spread south.  In the beginning of the movie, no nuclear attacks are shown, but the action opens on the USS Sawfish as it makes its way towards Melbourne.  Later on, after the Sawfish leaves Ralph Swain in San Francisco and heads towards San Diego, the crew makes discussions on how a book about World War III could be written, but as details of the war to them are sketchy, they are at a loss as to who started the war (though one crewman states that America didn't start the war and another crewman wishes that somebody could've prevented the war before it broke out) and make jokes about Martians, who might know the answer, but take over Earth once the radiation levels drop.  When they ask Osborn for his opinion on who started the war, Osborn first answers [[Albert Einstein]], blaming him for finding the equation that resulted in the discovery of atomic power and the creation of nuclear weapons, but comes up with a better hypothesis on how the war could've started accidentally.  In Osborn's hypothesis, somewhere in one of the Eastern European nations, a man on radar duty saw incoming objects on the radar screen and mistook them for missiles launched by their enemies (though it's likely the incoming objects may have been a flock of birds) and, without hesitation (for doing so, he feared, would've resulted in his nation getting hit) pressed the button that launched the first nuclear missiles of the war.  Upon finishing his hypothesis, Osborn then comments on how mankind by that time had become stupid enough to cause his own extinction through weapons they couldn't use responsibly without regarding the consequences first.\n\nIn the novel it has been two years since the last nuclear attacks, and small pockets of human survivors are mentioned in several areas of the Southern Hemisphere. Australia is in radio contact with places such as [[Montevideo]], on the east coast of [[South America]], and [[Cape Town]], on the southern tip of [[Africa]]. Commander Towers is in communication with the only other remaining active-duty [[United States Navy|US Navy]] vessel, another nuclear submarine, USS ''Swordfish'', on duty in the Atlantic, which, at the end, is based in Montevideo. Melbourne, where much of the novel is set, is the southernmost major city in the world. It will be the last such to die, but people in [[New Zealand]], [[Tierra del Fuego]] and other, more southerly points than Australia, are said to have a few additional weeks left to them.<ref>Shute 1957, p. 117.</ref> In the film an unidentified radio newscaster says that, as far as is known, Australia is home to the last human life on the planet. This to possibly build hope that the San Francisco expedition will result in the discovery of other survivors, adding a sense of urgency and importance to Melbourne's survivors.\n\nIn the film there is no USS ''Swordfish'', only the submarine USS ''Scorpion''. For the film, ''Scorpion'' is renamed ''Sawfish'', and the boat comes to represent the last (known) hope for humanity. The film's production crew was forced to use a non-nuclear, diesel-electric [[Royal Navy]] submarine, [[HMS Andrew (P423)|HMS ''Andrew'']], as a stand-in for the nuclear-powered ''Sawfish''.<ref name=\"Bartlett\">Bartlett, Andrew.

In the novel the signals are coming from a naval training base farther north, near [[Seattle]]. The idea of a survivor sending random signals is forthrightly dismissed in the novel as ridiculous. Towers says that even someone who didn't know Morse code would sit there with a Morse book and send at about five words per minute. The film's characters, however, hold out hope that there could be a person on the other end of the telegraph (this is possibly used as a plot device to build suspense and hope). The main reason in the novel for the expedition is to learn if there are indeed survivors. Rather than a telegraph operator, the characters hold out hope that, without the intercession of technicians and maintenance workers, the possibility of telegraph power being supplied after all that time would be remote at best. It turns out that, as in the film, the power station has been running on its own since the war, but it is beginning to break down from lack of maintenance, particularly the lubrication needed to prevent overheating. Just as in the film, the power station is shut down before the submarine sails for home.\n\nDuring Lt. Sunderstrom's search in the film for the signals' author, he is given just one hour, while in the novel, he is given two hours to find the source. Just like the novel, Sunderstrom's radiation suit doesn't have a wrist watch to help him keep track of his time ashore, so the submarine crew alerts him with horn blasts every quarter of an hour. In the film, a single horn blast was given every fifteen minutes, and Sunderstrom is ordered to return immediately after hearing the third blast. In the novel, the submarine crew gives one horn blast for a quarter of an hour, two for half an hour, three for three quarters, and four for a whole hour. He's ordered to stop what he's doing at five horn blasts (1 1/4 hours) and return at six horn blasts (1 1/2 hours). In the novel, Sunderstrom finds several bodies during his search, while in the film, there are no dead bodies at the power station. While Sunderstrom finds the source of the signals, he discovers in the novel that it's a window shade cord caught on a telegraph key. In the film he finds it's an overturned Coke bottle snagged in a window shade cord above the telegraph key. Ocean breezes, in both cases, are blowing through an open window making the window shade disturb the telegraph key. Sunderstrom sends a proper Morse message to describe how they have traveled all that way for nothing. In both the novel and the film, while Sunderstrom receives his return orders, the captain also warns him not to bring any souvenirs aboard, as they could be contaminated with radioactivity. In the novel, after Sunderstrom shuts off the power station, he explores a bit and defies his orders by bringing aboard three of the last printed issues of the ''[[Saturday Evening Post]]'', so he catches up on a serial that was running when the war started. In the film, after Sunderstrom sends his message, he follows Towers's orders to not bring aboard any souvenirs and is already en route to ''Sawfish'' when he hears the final horn blast.\n\nIn the film San Francisco's buildings are completely undamaged, with one memorable shot occurring when ''Sawfish'' first passes under the intact [[Golden Gate Bridge]]. In the novel the city has been largely destroyed and the bridge has fallen into the bay.\n\nIn the novel, the northernmost point of the submarine's journey is the [[Gulf of Alaska]], while the film uses Point Barrow.<ref>Shute 1957, pp. 144\u2013157.</ref>\n\nTowers and Moira attend the Australian Grand Prix and go to the mountains afterwards in the film. In the novel, they are vacationing in the mountains on the day of the race, and they hear a radio report of John Osborne's first-place finish.\n\nThe novel ends with a dying Moira sitting in her car, having taken her suicide pills, while watching ''Scorpion'' head out to sea to be [[scuttling|scuttled]]. Unlike the novel, no mention of scuttling the submarine is made in the film. Instead, Commander Towers's crew asks that he attempt to take them back to the U.S., where they can die on their home soil. Although he realizes that they probably will not survive a second passage north, he does as they request. In the film Ava Gardner is merely watching the submarine submerge and disappear beneath the sea and is not shown taking her suicide pills.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d95IlXQe_NQ \"On The Beach (1959, Ava Gardner, Gregory Peck).\"] ''Youtube''.
