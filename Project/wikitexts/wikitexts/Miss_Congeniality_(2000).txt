The film stars Bullock as Gracie Hart, a [[tomboy]] agent who is asked by the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] to go undercover as a contestant when a terrorist threatens to bomb the [[Miss United States]] pageant. [[Michael Caine]], [[Benjamin Bratt]], [[Candice Bergen]], [[William Shatner]], and [[Ernie Hudson]] star in supporting roles.\n\n''Miss Congeniality'' was released by [[Warner Bros. Pictures]] on December 22, 2000. The film was a box office hit, grossing $212 million worldwide against its $45 million budget, and earned Bullock a nomination for a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress \u2013 Motion Picture Comedy or Musical]]. It was followed by the [[sequel]] ''[[Miss Congeniality 2: Armed and Fabulous]]'' in 2005.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1982, a young Gracie Hart steps into a playground fight to beat up a [[bully]] who is threatening a boy she likes. However, the boy feels humiliated at being rescued by a girl and rejects her rudely. In response, Gracie punches him in the nose and leaves to sulk alone.\n\nYears later, Gracie is now a tough [[special agent]] for the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]]. During a sting operation against Russian mobsters, she disobeys her superior's orders in order to save a mob boss who appears to be choking, which causes one of the other agents to be shot. Gracie is demoted to a desk job as punishment. Soon after, the agency is alerted via a letter from the notorious [[domestic terrorist]] known only as \"the Citizen\" to a bomb threat at the upcoming 75th annual [[Miss United States]] [[beauty pageant]] in [[San Antonio|San Antonio, Texas]]. Gracie's partner Eric Matthews is put in charge, and he relies on Gracie's suggestions, only to take credit for them himself. One of Gracie's ideas is to plant an agent [[undercover]] at the event and reach the top five so they have access to everything in the pageant. When all possible candidates are deemed unfit, Eric suggests that Gracie take on that role, replacing Miss [[New Jersey]], who was to be disqualified.\n\nBeauty pageant coach Victor Melling teaches Gracie how to dress, walk and behave like a contestant. Although she was initially appalled, Gracie comes to appreciate Victor's thoroughness. Gracie enters the pageant as \"Gracie Lou Freebush\", representing New Jersey, and becomes friends with Cheryl Frasier, who is Miss [[Rhode Island]]. As the competition begins, Gracie impresses the judges during the talent competition with her [[glass harp]] skills and [[self-defense]] techniques.\n\nSeveral suspects are identified, including the current competition director and former pageant winner Kathy Morningside, her assistant Frank Tobin, the veteran [[MC]] Stan Fields, and Cheryl, who has a history of being a radical [[Animal rights|animal rights activist]]. Gracie accompanies Cheryl and other contestants as they spend a night partying, where Gracie tries to dig into Cheryl's past, but inadvertently learns from the others that Kathy's past as a pageant contestant is suspect, including the fact that she won after the leading contestant suddenly came down with food poisoning. Gracie comes to believe Kathy is a \"Citizen\" copycat. When Gracie reports this to Eric and the team, she learns that \"The Citizen\" has been arrested on an unrelated charge, and because there is no further threat, their supervisor has pulled the mission. Gracie insists that she suspects something is wrong, and Eric returns to Texas to help her continue the investigation against orders.\n\nIn the final round, Gracie is stunned when she is named first runner-up. Cheryl is named Miss United States, but as she goes to accept the [[tiara]], Gracie realizes that Frank, who is actually Kathy's son, impersonated \"the Citizen\" to make the pageant bomb threat. She throws the tiara up at the stage scenery, where it explodes and sets the stage on fire. As Kathy and Frank are arrested, Gracie determines that the two wanted to kill the pageant winner on stage as revenge for Kathy's termination from the Miss United States organization. As the event closes down and Gracie and Eric prepare to return to headquarters with a newfound interest in each other, the other contestants name Gracie \"Miss Congeniality\".\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Sandra Bullock]] as FBI Special Agent Gracie Hart\n** Mary Ashleigh Green as Young Gracie\n* [[Michael Caine]] as Victor Melling\n* [[Benjamin Bratt]] as FBI Agent Eric Matthews\n* [[Candice Bergen]] as Kathy Morningside\n* [[William Shatner]] as Stanley Fields\n* [[Heather Burns]] as Cheryl Frasier ([[Miss Rhode Island]])\n* [[Deirdre Quinn]] as Mary Jo Wright ([[Miss Texas]])\n* [[Wendy Raquel Robinson]] as Leslie Davis ([[Miss California]])\n* [[Melissa De Sousa]] as Karen Krantz ([[Miss New York]])\n* Asia De Marcos as Alana Krewson ([[Miss Hawaii]])\n* [[Steve Monroe]] as Frank Tobin\n* [[Ernie Hudson]] as FBI Assistant Director Harry McDonald\n* [[John DiResta]] as Agent Clonsky\n\n==Production==\n\n===Development===\n[[Ellen DeGeneres]] claims that the writer was inspired when watching her training to walk in [[high heels]] and a [[dress]] in preparation for the Emmys.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://parade.com/265922/shawnamalcom/oscar-host-ellen-degeneres-why-i-love-the-movies/ |title=Oscar Host Ellen DeGeneres: Why I Love the Movies |publisher=Parade |date=28 February 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Filming===\nThe story is set in [[New York City]] and [[San Antonio]].
