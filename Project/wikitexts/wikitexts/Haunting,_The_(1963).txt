It stars [[Julie Harris]], [[Claire Bloom]], [[Richard Johnson (actor)|Richard Johnson]], and [[Russ Tamblyn]]. The film depicts the experiences of a small group of people invited by a [[paranormal]] investigator to investigate a purportedly [[haunted house]].\n\nScreenwriter Gidding, who had worked with director Wise on the 1958 film ''[[I Want to Live!]]'', began a six-month write of the script after reading the book, which Wise had given to him. He perceived the book to be more about mental breakdown than [[ghost]]s, and although he was informed after meeting author Shirley Jackson that it was very much a supernatural novel, elements of mental breakdown were introduced into the film. The film was shot at the [[MGM-British Studios]] near London, UK on a budget of US$1.05 million, with exteriors and the grounds shot at [[Ettington Park Hotel|Ettington Park]] (now the Ettington Park Hotel) in the village of [[Ettington]], [[Warwickshire]]. Julie Harris was cast by Wise, who found her ideal for the psychologically fragile Eleanor, though during production she suffered from depression and had an uneasy relationship with her co-stars. The interior sets were by [[Elliot Scott]], credited by Wise as instrumental in the making of ''The Haunting''. They were designed to be brightly lit, with no dark corners or recesses, and decorated in a [[Rococo#Interior design|Rococo]] style; all the rooms had ceilings to create a claustrophobic effect on film. Numerous devices and tricks were used in the filming. Wise used a 30mm [[Anamorphic format|anamorphic]], [[wide-angle lens]] [[Panavision]] camera that was not technically ready for use and caused distortions. It was only given to Wise on condition that he sign a memorandum in which he acknowledged that the lens was imperfect. Wise and cinematographer Davis Boulton planned sequences that kept the camera moving, utilizing low-angle takes, and incorporating unusual [[Panning (camera)|pans]] and [[tracking shot]]s.\n\nThe film was released on 18 September 1963. In 2010, ''[[The Guardian]]'' newspaper ranked it as the 13th-best horror film of all time.<ref>{{cite news|first1=Stuart|last1=Heritage|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/oct/22/haunting-wise-horror|title=The Haunting: No 13 best horror film of all time}}</ref> Director [[Martin Scorsese]] has placed ''The Haunting'' first on his list of the 11 scariest horror films of all time.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Pulver|first1=Andrew|title=Martin Scorsese names his scariest films of all time|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/nov/12/martin-scorsese-scariest-films-the-haunting-shining|website=[[The Guardian]]|date=12 November 2013}}</ref> ''The Haunting'' was released on [[DVD]] in its original screen format with commentary in 2003, and was released on [[Blu-ray]] on 15 October 2013. [[The Haunting (1999 film)|The film was remade in 1999]] by director [[Jan de Bont]], starring [[Liam Neeson]], [[Lili Taylor]], [[Catherine Zeta-Jones]] and [[Owen Wilson]], but that version was heavily panned by critics and audiences. A streaming television adaptation, [[The Haunting of Hill House (TV series)|''The Haunting of Hill House'']], was released in 2018.\n\n==Plot==\nDr. John Markway narrates the history of the 90-year-old Hill House, which was constructed in [[Massachusetts]] by Hugh Crain as a home for his wife. She died when her carriage crashed against a tree as she approached the house for the first time. Crain remarried, but his second wife died in the house from a fall down the stairs. Crain's daughter Abigail lived in the house for the rest of her life, never moving out of the [[Nursery (room)|nursery]] room. She died calling for her nurse-companion. The companion inherited the house, but later [[Suicide|hanged herself]] from a spiral staircase in the library. Hill House was eventually inherited by a Mrs. Sanderson, although it has stood empty for some time.\n\nMarkway wishes to study the reported paranormal activity at Hill House and sends invitations for people to join his investigation; however, Mrs. Sanderson demands that Markway allow her heir Luke Sanderson to join. Only two other individuals accept\u2014Theodora, a psychic, and Eleanor Lance, who experienced [[poltergeist]] activity as a child. Eleanor spent her adult life caring for her invalid mother, whose recent death has left Eleanor with severe guilt.\n\nThe group find the mansion's walls were constructed with angles askew, resulting in off-center [[Perspective (visual)|perspectives]] and doors that open and close by themselves. The library contains the ramshackle spiral staircase, from which the previous owner hanged herself. During their first night in the house, Eleanor and Theo are terrified by banging sounds made against the door to Theo's bedroom, and hear the voice of a young girl echoing. Despite this, Eleanor feels a tentative affinity to Hill House. The following day, the group explores the house, discovering a [[Cold spot (paranormal)|cold spot]] outside the nursery room. Following another night of loud disturbances, the words \"Help Eleanor Come Home\" are found scrawled in a chalky substance on a wall the next morning, distressing Eleanor.\n\nThat night, Theo moves into Eleanor's room, and they fall asleep in the same bed. Eleanor is awakened by the sounds of a man speaking indistinctly and a woman laughing.  Fearful, Eleanor asks Theo to hold her hand and soon she feels a crushing grip. As Eleanor hears the sound of a young girl crying, she shouts at whoever is causing the child pain. Theo awakens to find that Eleanor has moved from the bed to the couch, and Eleanor realizes it was not Theo's hand she held.\n\nThe following day Dr. Markway's skeptical wife Grace arrives at Hill House to warn him that a reporter has learned of his investigation there. Grace announces that she plans to join the group for the duration of the investigation, to the consternation of Eleanor, who had begun developing feelings for Markway while unaware that he was married, and demands a room in the nursery despite her husband's warning that it is likely the center of the disturbances. That night in the living room, the group experiences loud banging and an unseen intruder attempting to force its way into the room, causing the door to bulge inward. The banging moves towards the nursery, where sounds of destruction are heard. Eleanor runs towards the source and discovers Grace is missing. The next morning, Eleanor's mental instability worsens as she enters the library and climbs the dilapidated spiral staircase, followed by Markway, who tries to coax her down. At the top, Eleanor suddenly glimpses Grace's face through a trap door. Startled, she nearly falls to her death before being rescued by Markway.\n\nMarkway becomes alarmed at Eleanor's obsession with Hill House in spite of its dangers. Eleanor pleads to stay, but Markway insists that she leave. Eleanor drives off and speeds toward the front gates. The steering wheel begins to turn by itself, and Eleanor struggles to regain control before surrendering to the unseen force. A female figure suddenly appears and runs past in front of the car, causing Eleanor to crash into a tree and die. Markway and the others arrive to find that it is Grace, who says the House has been keeping her lost on purpose. She ended up in the attic when she was trying to find a way back to Dr. Markway, and Eleanor saw her. She was unsure of how she found her way outside the house, or got in front of Eleanor's car. Luke observes that Eleanor deliberately aimed the car at the tree, but Markway asserts that something was in the car with her. He notes that the tree was the same one where Mrs. Crain died. Theo remarks that Eleanor got what she wanted\u2014to remain with the house. Convinced at last of the supernatural forces he once scoffed at, Luke says solemnly, \"It ought to be burned down ... and the ground sowed with salt.\" Over a final shot of the house, part of the opening narration is repeated, this time by the voice of Eleanor.\n\n==Production==\n[[Robert Wise]] was in post-production on ''[[West Side Story (1961 film)|West Side Story]]'' when he read a review in ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine of author [[Shirley Jackson]]'s novel, ''[[The Haunting of Hill House]]''.{{sfn|Rigby|2000|p=120}} Wise read the book and found it frightening; he passed it to screenwriter friend Nelson Gidding, with whom he had worked on the film ''[[I Want to Live!]]'' (1958).<ref name=\"Marriott1959\">[[#Marriott|Marriott 2012]], p. 1959</ref> Gidding did a full [[Film treatment|story treatment]] for Wise before proceeding to work on the adaptation.<ref name=\"Gidding65\" /> As Gidding crafted the screenplay, he came to believe that the novel was not a ghost story at all, but rather a compilation of the insane thoughts of the lead character, Eleanor Vance. He theorised that Vance was having a [[nervous breakdown]], envisaging a scenario in which Hill House is the hospital where she is held, Markway is her psychiatrist, the cold, banging, and violence are the results of [[Electroconvulsive therapy|shock treatment]], and the opening and closing of doors reflected the opening and closing of hospital doors.<ref>[[#Gidding|Gidding and Weaver 2001]], p. 64.</ref> Wise and Gidding travelled to [[Bennington, Vermont]], to meet Jackson, who told them that it was a good idea but that the novel was definitely about the supernatural.<ref>[[#Gidding|Gidding and Weaver 2001]], pp. 64-65.</ref> Nonetheless, elements of the insanity concept remained in the script, so that the audience was left wondering whether the supernatural events in the film were in Eleanor's mind or whether they were real.<ref name=\"Gidding65\">[[#Gidding|Gidding and Weaver 2001]], p. 65.</ref> It was also during their visit to speak with Jackson that Wise and Gidding chose the title for the film. As they did not want to keep the book title, they asked Jackson if she had considered an alternative title. She suggested ''The Haunting'', which Wise and Gidding immediately adopted.<ref name=\"Sloane22\">[[#Sloane|Sloane 1995]], p. 22.</ref>\n\n===Script===\nWriting the screenplay took about six months. During this period, Gidding worked alone, and although he passed some of his work to Wise to show him that work on the screenplay was progressing well, he and Wise did not otherwise collaborate on the screenplay.<ref name=\"Gidding65\" /> The screenplay made other changes to the story. The number of characters was cut down, the backstory was significantly shortened, most of the supernatural events depicted in the novel were kept off-screen, and the greater part of the action was set inside the house to heighten the audience's feeling of claustrophobia.<ref name=\"Marriott1959\" /> Eleanor's role as an outcast was also emphasized. The character of Theodora was given a sharper, slightly more cruel sense of humour in order to make her a foil for Eleanor but also to heighten Eleanor's outsider status. The role of Luke became more flippant, and Dr. Markway (Montague in the novel) was made a more confident character.<ref name=\"Keesey\">{{cite web|author=Keesey, Pam |date=January 2002|url=http://www.monsterzine.com/200201/haunting.php|title= The Haunting and the Power of Suggestion: Why Robert Wise's Masterpiece Continues to Deliver the Goods to Modern Audiences|publisher=MonsterZine|access-date=7 October 2012}}</ref> The screenplay was finished just after Wise completed work on ''West Side Story''.{{sfn|Bansak|1995|p=481}}\n\nWise approached [[United Artists]] with the project, but after much delay they turned him down. Wise's agent then suggested that, since Wise owed [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] (MGM) a film under an old contract, Wise should take the project there. MGM agreed, but would only give Wise a $1 million budget. Wise knew he could not do the film at MGM's Culver City Studios (now the [[Sony Pictures Studios]]), so took it to England, as the [[Eady Levy]] gave tax breaks and financing to films made there as a way of subsidizing and promoting the British film industry.{{sfn|Bansak|1995|pp=481, 482}}  Someone suggested to Wise that he approach [[MGM-British Studios|MGM's Borehamwood Studios subsidiary]]. Wise had been asked to come to the United Kingdom for a [[Royal Command Performance]] of ''West Side Story'', and during the trip made the financing pitch to MGM Borehamwood. They offered a budget of $1.050 million.{{sfn|Bansak|1995|pp=481, 482}} With the Eady Levy support, this allowed the film to go forward with production in the United Kingdom.<ref name=\"Gidding65\" />\n\n===Casting===\n{| class=\"infobox\"\n|-\n!

But she also chose it because she had a long-standing interest in [[parapsychology]].<ref name=\"Sloane22\" /> English actress Claire Bloom was cast as Theo. In part, however, the decision to cast Bloom and Johnson was because of [[Eady Levy]] requirements that the cast be partly British.{{sfn|Morris|2009|p=58}} To make Bloom's character appear more bohemian, mod fashion designer [[Mary Quant]] was hired to design clothing specifically for the Theodora character.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/454500582.html?dids=454500582:454500582&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:AI&type=historic&date=Dec+11%2C+1962&author=&pub=Los+Angeles+Times&desc=Julie+Harris+Seen+as+%27Haunting%27+Hit&pqatl=google |author=Scheuer, Philip K. |title=Julie Harris Seen as 'Haunting' Hit|newspaper= [[Los Angeles Times]]|date=11 December 1962}}</ref>\n\n[[Richard Johnson (actor)|Richard Johnson]], under contract to MGM, was cast as Dr. Markway. Wise saw Johnson in a [[Royal Shakespeare Company]] production of ''[[The Devils (play)|The Devils]]''. Impressed with his acting, he offered him the role. Johnson later said he received invaluable film acting advice from Wise. Wise told him to keep his eyes steady, to blink less, and to try not to time his acting (Wise said he would take care of that in the editing room). Johnson also credited Wise with helping him to craft a much more natural acting performance.<ref name=\"Sloane22\" /> [[Russ Tamblyn]], also under contract to MGM, initially turned down the role as Luke because he felt that the character was \"a jerk\", although he thought that the script was very good. The studio forced him to reconsider, threatening him with suspension.<ref name=\"Marriott1959\" /> Tamblyn told the British cinema magazine ''Film Review'' in 1995 that while reading the script a second time, he realised the character was much more interesting. \"This is the ironic part,\" he said, \"it turned out to be one of my favourite films that I've been in!\"<ref name=\"Sloane22\" />\n\n[[Stunt performer]] Connie Tilton appears twice in the film.

Tilton also appears when Abigail Crain's Nurse-Companion hangs herself at the top of the spiral staircase in the library. Although uncredited actress Rosemary Dorken is seen climbing the stairs and going past the camera, it is Tilton's body that suddenly appears in shot again as the Nurse-Companion hangs herself.<ref name=\"Pressbook2a\" />\n\n===Filming===\n[[File:Ettington Park - geograph.org.uk - 1230701.jpg|thumb|left|300px|[[Ettington Park Hotel|Ettington Park]] (shown here in 2009) was used for exteriors of haunted Hill House.]]\nWise called ''The Haunting'' one of his top ten or twelve favourites among the films he made, commenting that it was his favourite film-making experience.{{sfn|Bansak|1995|p=482}} [[Ettington Park Hotel|Ettington Park]] (now the Ettington Park Hotel), with its grounds near the village of [[Ettington]], [[Warwickshire]], was used for exterior shots of Hill House.{{sfn|Rigby|2000|p=121}} According to actor Russ Tamblyn, Wise approached a society that kept track of British haunted houses, and they gave him a list of such places.{{sfn|Bansak|1995|p=482}}  Production designer Elliot Scott was sent around the country to look at each house, and Wise personally selected Ettington Park.{{sfn|Bansak|1995|p=482}}<ref>[[#Sloane|Sloane 1995]], p. 22-23.</ref> Some of the cast and crew were housed in Ettington Park during exterior shooting.{{sfn|Bansak|1995|p=482}} However, the location did not sit well with Harris and Bloom who upon arriving at Ettington Park thought it was \"scary looking outside\", and Wise had to reassure them.<ref name=\"Sloane23\" /> Interior sets were constructed and shot at the MGM-British Studios in [[Borehamwood]], [[Hertfordshire]].{{sfn|Rigby|2000|p=120}} The interior sets were designed by [[Elliot Scott]], credited by Wise as a \"major contributor\" to ''The Haunting''.<ref>[[#Wise|Wise and Leemann 1995]], p. 175.</ref><ref name=\"Szebin\">Szebin, Frederick C. \"The Sound of Screaming\". ''Cinefantastique'', 29:4/5 (October 1997), p. 141.</ref> The sets were designed to be brightly lit, with no dark corners or recesses, and decorated in a [[Rococo#Interior design|Rococo]] style. All rooms had ceilings to create a claustrophobic effect on film (this was unusual, as most film sets forgo ceilings to add in lighting and filming). Actor Richard Johnson said that the sets' eeriness created a \"subdued atmosphere\" among the cast and crew.<ref name=\"Marriott1959\" />\n\nWise says that his contract with MGM specified that the picture could only be shot in black-and-white, which Wise preferred for this genre of film.<ref name=\"Szebin\" /> He attempted to make Ettington Park look more sinister through various lighting effects and camera settings, but this failed.<ref name=\"Pressbook2\" /> Wise and Boulton then hit on the idea of using [[infrared film]] for establishing shots of the house. Infrared film stocks were quickly rushed to the location shoot from Belgium.<ref name=\"Pressbook2\" /> The new film worked. Wise felt the infrared film brought out the \"striations of the stone\" and made the mansion look like \"more of a monster house\".{{sfn|Rigby|2000|p=121}}<ref>[[#Silver|Silver and Wise 2002]], p. 133.</ref> Wise very much wanted to make ''The Haunting'' a tribute to [[Val Lewton]], the producer and writer under whom Wise had directed his first film (the supernatural horror picture ''[[Curse of the Cat People]]'').<ref name=\"Sloane23\" /> Wise says that Lewton's theory of horror was that people were more afraid of the unknown than things they could see. The decision to show little that was supernatural was made very early in the picture's pre-production.<ref name=\"Sloane24\" /> Wise and cinematographer Davis Boulton also wanted to make distances in the film (such as hallways) look longer and darker than the audience would anticipate. Wise approached the [[Panavision]] company, and wanted an [[Anamorphic format|anamorphic]], [[wide-angle lens]]. The only lens Panavision had was a 40mm. Wise learned that the company was working on a 30mm lens, but it contained distortions and was not ready. Wise kept pressing, and eventually Panavision turned over the 30mm lens on the condition that Wise signed a memorandum in which he acknowledged it was imperfect.<ref name=\"Leemann177\">[[#Wise|Wise and Leemann 1995]], p. 177.</ref> Wise and Boulton also planned shots that kept the camera moving, utilised low-angle shots, and incorporated unusual [[Panning (camera)|pans]] and [[tracking shot]]s. This led to some of the most active camera movements in Wise's film career.{{sfn|Busch|2010|p=41}} To accentuate the feeling that the house was alive, exterior shots were filmed so that the windows appeared to be eyes.<ref name=\"Sloane23\">[[#Sloane|Sloane 1995]], p. 23.</ref>\n\nDuring the shoot, Harris suffered from [[Depression (mood)|depression]], and believed that her co-stars did not take the film as seriously as she did.<ref>\"In Review: 'The Haunting'\". ''Cinefantastique''. 35:4 (2003), p. 68.</ref> At times, she would cry in her makeup chair prior to the day's shoot. The other actors remember her as being distant, not a part of their socializing and joking, and Harris did not speak to Bloom during filming, which puzzled Bloom. Afterward, Harris told Bloom that the lack of interaction had helped her build her own performance and the two women reconciled.<ref name=\"Marriott1959\" /> Harris incorporated her own depression into her performance. Wise heightened the sense of character conflict by having the characters \"step on one another's lines\", allowing one character to begin talking before the other had finished. On occasion, the characters simply talk at the same time.<ref name=\"Keesey\" />\n\nTo enhance the actors' performances during scenes in which they react to off-stage voices or sounds, Wise and his sound editors created a \"pre-scored\" soundtrack of voices and noises. These were played back during filming, and Wise says they greatly enhanced the acting performances.{{sfn|Bansak|1995|p=482}} Although some sounds were replaced during post-production, the \"pre-scored\" sounds were left on the soundtrack just as the actors heard them.{{sfn|Morris|2009|p=58}} Sound editors collected and created sounds in an empty manor house for a week to create the pre-score.<ref name=\"Pressbook2\">{{cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/1560/The-Haunting/tcm-archives.html|title= How Do You Photograph Nothing?

Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, 1963, p. 2., via Turner Classic Movies|access-date=7 October 2012}}</ref> Some of the sounds are very low in the bass range,{{sfn|Ahlzen|Song|2003|p=162}} which can cause physical sensations at high volume.\n\n===Effects and editing===\nThe film contains a number of [[special effect]]s, many of which were achieved in ways not immediately obvious to the viewer. In one scene, a supernatural force pushes against a large parlour door, bending it inward repeatedly. Though the door appears to some viewers to have been made of latex, it was in fact made of [[laminate]]d wood; the strange buckling was simply the result of a strong crew member pushing a piece of timber hard against it.{{sfn|Morris|2009|p=58}}\n\nTwo physical effects were used to make the spiral staircase in the library appear frightening. In one scene, the camera appears to ascend the staircase at a rapid rate. Wise achieved this effect by using the staircase's handrail as a makeshift [[Camera dolly|dolly track]]: a camera was attached to the rail and then slowly allowed to slide down, with the speed of the descent controlled by a wire attached to the camera. The sequence was then reversed and run at high speed, which gave the final cut an unworldly feel.<ref name=\"Leemann177\" /> In another scene, the staircase appears to become unstable and give way as Luke Sanderson ascends it. Later, Eleanor goes up the staircase in a trance-like state and is rescued by Dr. Markway, even as the staircase seems ready to collapse. The collapsing staircase effect was designed by a metalworker at the Borehamwood studios.<ref name=\"Sloane24\">[[#Sloane|Sloane 1995]], p. 24.</ref> The effect was created by tying portions of the steps and railing to a cable that ran inside the staircase's central support column. When the cable was slackened, elements of the stairway loosened up and moved freely. Conversely, when the cable was tightened, the staircase appeared solid and stable.<ref name=\"Marriott1959\" /> The effect disturbed the cast so much that Robert Wise had to ascend the staircase while it was shaking in order to prove that it was safe.<ref name=\"Sloane24\" />\n\nOther effects also relied on simple cinema tricks. Early in the film, the audience sees Abigail Crain lying in bed, ageing from a young child to an old woman. A camera was fixed over the bed, and four different actresses (each a different age) posed in the bed beneath the camera. [[Dissolve (filmmaking)|Dissolves]] were then used to illustrate the ageing process.<ref name=\"Sloane24\" /> In another scene, the characters come across a \"cold spot\" in the haunted mansion. Wise had initially wanted the actors to simply play up \"the 'quality of [being] cold' in [the] sequence\", but he quickly recognized that an additional visual effect was needed to more clearly emphasize the temperature drop.<ref name=\"Pressbook2\" /> To overcome the unique issue of having to \"photograph 'nothing{{' \"}}, Wise instructed the makeup department to apply a special makeup onto the actors. This makeup contained a compound that was usually invisible to the naked eye but that appeared under certain filters. When it came time to film, the actors walked onto the portion of the set that was supposed to represent the cold spot, and these filters were gradually drawn over the set's lights. This gave the visual impression that the characters had turned pale due to a drop in temperature.<ref name=\"Pressbook2\" />\n\nThe camera work and editing are used with the intent of further heightening the frightening qualities of the film. Eleanor is often viewed from above, and in one scene the camera closes in so tightly on her that she is forced backward over a railing.<ref name=\"Marriott1959\" /> Eleanor's viewpoint is often juxtaposed with eerie views of the house, as if both viewpoints were the same.<ref name=\"Marriott1959\" /><ref name=\"Keesey\" /> Many of the editing choices in the film were also used to heighten the audience's discomfort. There are a number of rapid [[Cut (transition)|cuts]] in the film that throw off the viewer's sense of spatial orientation, and [[Dutch angle]]s are used to imply that reality is off-kilter. Likewise, [[cutting on action]] is often violated \u2014 showing the characters exiting a room to the right, for example, only to show them entering the next room from the left \u2014 so that the viewer cannot get a clear sense of which rooms and hallways are connected to one another.<ref name=\"Marriott1959\" /> The film also lacks temporal clues, and there are few shots in which the audience can see out a window to determine whether it is night or day. In other instances, windows are visible but do little to establish temporality: for instance, when Eleanor is rescued by Dr. Markway on the unstable spiral staircase, some of the windows nearby show strong sunlight streaming in, while others show darkness outside.<ref name=\"Marriott1959\" />\n\n''The Haunting'' is notable for its [[lesbian]] character, Theodora. Although the character's lesbianism is subtly mentioned in the novel, the film makes it explicit.{{sfn|Castle|1993|p=246, n. 15}} The film is also one of the few Hollywood motion pictures of its day to depict a lesbian as feminine and not predatory.<ref>[[#White|White 1999]], p. 78-91.</ref> Theodora's lesbianism helps to create conflict in the picture. Had Theodora been heterosexual, Eleanor's growing attraction to Markway would not have threatened her. But with Theodora a clear lesbian, Markway becomes a threat that causes conflict between the psychic and the investigator.<ref name=\"Keesey\" /> Originally, Gidding's script had contained a scene early in the film in which Theodora is shown in her apartment in the city. It is clear from the context that she has just broken off with her female lover: \"I hate you\" is written on the mirror in lipstick. Theodora is yelling curses at her out the window and more. However, Wise decided to cut the scene, believing it to be too explicit for a film that worked hard to make things implicit.<ref name=\"Leemann177\" /><ref>Szebin, Frederick C. \"The Sound of Screaming\". ''Cinefantastique''. 29:4/5 (October 1997), p. 140.</ref> According to Harris, film censors demanded that Theo never be shown to touch Eleanor, in order to keep the lesbianism less obvious.<ref name=\"Sloane22\" />\n\n==Reception==\n''The Haunting'' opened in New York and Los Angeles on 18 September 1963.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://catalog.afi.com/Film/23698-THE-HAUNTING|publisher=[[American Film Institute]]|title=The Haunting|access-date=10 April 2020}}</ref> Audiences were frightened by it. Film critic Dora Jane Hamblin related how four of her female friends went to see the film, which proved so frightening that afterwards, the group spent fifteen minutes looking for the contents of their purses, which had spilled onto the floor over the course of the movie as the women jumped out of their seats from fear.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=GlIEAAAAMBAJ&lpg=PA40-IA2&ots=ROW67w8ijl&dq=%22The%20Haunting%22%20movie&pg=PA37#v=onepage&q=%22The%20Haunting%22%20movie&f=false Hamblin, Dora Jane. \"Great New Scary Film\"].

''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' called the acting effective, Davis Boulton's cinematography extraordinarily dexterous and visually exciting, and Elliott Scott's production design of the \"monstrous\" house most decidedly the star of the film. However, the unnamed reviewer felt Gidding's screenplay had \"major shortcomings\" in that the plot was incomprehensible at points, and the motivation for the characters was poor.<ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|title=Film Reviews: 'The Haunting'|url=https://variety.com/1962/film/reviews/the-haunting-1200420301/|access-date=11 April 2020}}</ref> [[Bosley Crowther]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' cited ''The Haunting'' as \"one of the most highly regarded haunted house films ever produced\" but surmised that \"there is really no point to it\".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9A06E4D81431E73BBC4152DFBF668388679EDE|title=The Haunting (1963)|newspaper=The New York Times|date=19 September 1963}}</ref> Writing in ''[[The Atlantic]]'' magazine, critic [[Pauline Kael]] called the film \"moderately elegant and literate and expensive\", but criticised Russ Tamblyn for being \"feeble [and] cowardly-comic\".<ref>{{cite magazine|author=Kael, Pauline|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1964/11/are-movies-going-to-pieces/306083/|title=Are Movies Going to Pieces?|magazine= The Atlantic|date=November 1964}}</ref> She considered the film to be superior to [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s ''[[The Birds (film)|The Birds]]'', also released in 1963, yet didn't consider it to be a great film.{{sfn|Hawkins|2000|p=54}} Kael said of it, \"It wasn't a great movie but I certainly wouldn't have thought that it could offend anyone.
