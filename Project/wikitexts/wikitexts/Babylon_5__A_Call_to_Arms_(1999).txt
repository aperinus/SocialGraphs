It was written by [[J. Michael Straczynski]], directed by [[Mike Vejar]], and originally aired on [[TNT (American TV network)|TNT]] on January 3, 1999, as one of two films shown over the 1998\u20131999 season to fill in the gap between the fifth season of ''Babylon 5'' and the spin-off series ''[[Crusade (TV series)|Crusade]]''.\n\n==Summary==\nFive years after the establishment of the Interstellar Alliance, President [[John Sheridan (Babylon 5)|John Sheridan]] and Mr. [[Michael Garibaldi|Garibaldi]] rendezvous in deep space to oversee the completion of IAS ''Excalibur'', and IAS ''Victory'', the first in a series of prototype destroyers using technology [[reverse engineered]] from the [[Vorlon]]\u2013[[Minbari]] technology of the White Stars. En route to the firing range, Sheridan is visited in a dream by [[Technomage#Galen|Galen]], who shows him graphic images of Daltron 7, a world destroyed by a massive attack.\n\nAn alien thief named Dureena Nafeel ([[Carrie Dobro]]) arrives on ''[[Babylon 5 (fictional space station)|Babylon 5]]'' in search of the [[Thieves Guild]], to which she belongs. She is captured by their agents, and, upon revealing her credentials, is allowed to ply her trade provided she abide by their rules. In her sleep, she is visited by Galen who warns her to choose a target wisely when the time comes.\n\nOn the firing range, construction supervisor Lionel Drake demonstrates the capabilities of the Excalibur's Vorlon-influenced enhanced weapons system: the ship channels energy from its entire body to capacitance and channels it in a single burst of very powerful energy; the firing, however, leaves the ship underpowered for a recovery period of one minute. During the test, Sheridan is visited by Galen in a waking dream.  Galen informs him that while the Technomages will remain in hiding for another 20\u201330 years, they still watch the galaxy, and have learned of an impending attack on Earth by the [[Drakh]]: a vicious race formerly allied with the [[Shadow (Babylon 5)|Shadows]] who seek revenge for the part humans have played in defeating them in [[Shadow War|the war]], destroying their homeworld of [[Z'ha'dum (fictional planet)|Z'ha'dum]] and forming the Alliance, which thwarts their ambitions. Galen provides him with descriptions of three individuals who will meet him at ''Babylon 5'' to assist him, but explicitly warns him to never explain his actions or mission to anyone under any circumstances.\n\nSheridan cuts the test short and travels to ''Babylon 5'', where he provides descriptions to security, who quickly apprehend Dureena. Captain Anderson ([[Tony Todd]]) of the [[EarthForce]] destroyer ''Charon'', arrives and meets with Sheridan and Dureena; all have been alerted to each other by Galen. Dureena turns out to be a refugee from Zander Prime, a world destroyed during the Shadow War by a Shadow Planet Killer; she initially blames Sheridan for his inaction, but upon learning of the Drakh, realizes that they are responsible for what occurred. The team sneaks out of ''Babylon 5'' during the night on ''Charon'', and they travel to the shipyards and take ''Excalibur'' and ''Victory'' out to visit Daltron 7. They arrive to find the once pristine world scorched to ruin and they discover the body of the fourth member of their party, a [[Drazi]], on the surface. The Drazi's records indicate that Daltron 7 was destroyed by the Drakh less than a week before in a test as a prelude to their attack on [[Earth (Babylon 5)|Earth]], confirming that the Drakh are in possession of a Shadow planet killer. Meanwhile, Mr. Garibaldi catches up to the shipyard, and reluctantly takes Mr. Drake with him in pursuit of Sheridan.\n\nSheridan and Anderson are approached by a small Drakh fleet, who inquire about their identities and intentions. The Drakh suddenly receive a powerful encoded message and begin to flee; ''Excalibur'' and ''Victory'' pursue them only to find the entire Drakh fleet departing for Earth. After a short battle, they escape and contact ''Babylon 5'', informing [[Elizabeth Lochley|Captain Lochley]] ([[Tracy Scoggins]]) to alert EarthGov to mobilize their entire fleet. Sheridan contacts Garibaldi about the fleet and informs him about a possible informant; upon realizing the transmission came from his ship, Garibaldi discovers that Drake&nbsp;\u2013 a Mars citizen resentful of Earth's prejudice against [[Mars]]-born citizens&nbsp;\u2013 is the informant. Drake is subdued and forced to release the details of the Drakh attack fleet.\n\nSheridan and Anderson arrive in Earth space just ahead of the Drakh fleet and organize the Earth and Alliance fleets assembled to repel the attack, and a massive battle ensues when the Drakh emerge. During the conflict, Sheridan and Anderson venture into the Shadow planet killer in search of a primary component: the device is a well defended planet-sized web of interconnecting joints filled with core-penetrating nuclear warheads. Dureena uses her guile to correctly isolate the master control hub just as ''Victory''{{'}}s weapon systems are irreparably damaged.  Anderson and his crew plow ''Victory'' directly into the control hub, and the planet killer activates prematurely. The Earth and Alliance ships escape just as the planet killer destroys itself and most of the Drakh assault fleet. However, the last remaining Drakh ships bypass the defense grid and plunge into Earth orbit, releasing a black gaseous weapon that enshrouds the Earth.\n\nOn ''Babylon 5'', Sheridan reports to Lochley that the Earth has been contaminated by a biological weapon engineered by the Shadows; experts calculate that the plague will adapt to human physiology and kill all life on Earth inside of five years unless a cure is found. Determined to save the planet, Sheridan turns ''Excalibur'' into a research vessel, armed with the best experts that can be found to search the galaxy for other races and technologies who may possess the knowledge that can lead to a cure. Galen arrives on the station to assist in the mission.\n\n==Other information==\n''A Call to Arms'' acts as a sequel to ''Babylon 5'' and a prelude to the ''Babylon 5'' spin-off series ''[[Crusade (TV series)|Crusade]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0146455/|title=Babylon 5: A Call to Arms (TV Movie 1999)|date=January 13, 1999|work=IMDb}}</ref> It introduces two prominent characters for the cast of ''Crusade'', Galen and Dureena Nafeel, as well as the ship IAS ''Excalibur''.
