It is loosely based on the memoir ''[[American Sniper (book)|American Sniper]]'' (2012) by [[Chris Kyle]], with Scott McEwen and Jim DeFelice. The film follows the life of Kyle, who became the deadliest [[sniper|marksman]] in U.S. military history with 255 kills from four tours in the [[Iraq War]], 160 of which were officially confirmed by the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/american-sniper-author-defends-chris-899044|title='American Sniper' Co-Author Defends Chris Kyle's Military Record Over New Controversy|quote=We submitted the book for vetting with the DOD&nbsp;... and certain parts of the manuscript were, at their request, redacted.

The film was produced by Eastwood, [[Robert Lorenz]], [[Andrew Lazar]], [[Bradley Cooper]], and [[Peter Morgan (producer)|Peter Morgan]]. It stars Cooper as Kyle and [[Sienna Miller]] as his wife [[Taya Kyle|Taya]], with [[Luke Grimes]], [[Jake McDorman]], [[Cory Hardrict]], [[Kevin Lacz]], [[Navid Negahban]], and [[Keir O'Donnell]] in supporting roles.\n\nThe world premiere was on November 11, 2014, at the [[American Film Institute]] Festival, followed by a limited theatrical release in the United States on December 25, 2014, and a wide release on January 16, 2015. The film became a major success, with a worldwide gross of over $547 million, making it the 13th most successful film at the 2014 worldwide box office, the highest-grossing war film of all time unadjusted for inflation, the highest-grossing film with a wide release during the month of January, and Eastwood's highest-grossing film.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.the-numbers.com/person/43320401-Clint-Eastwood#tab=technical&all_technical_credits=od5 | title = Clint Eastwood Technical Credits - www.the-numbers.com | date= | access-date= }}</ref>\n\nThe film received positive reviews, with praise for Cooper's lead performance and Eastwood's directing. At the [[87th Academy Awards]], ''American Sniper'' received six nominations, including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Adapted Screenplay]], and [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] for Cooper, ultimately winning one award for [[Academy Award for Best Sound Editing|Best Sound Editing]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Chumley|first=Cheryl K.|date=February 23, 2015|title='American Sniper' wins Academy Award \u2014 for sound editing|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/feb/23/american-sniper-wins-academy-award-for-sound-editi/|work=[[The Washington Times]]|location=[[Washington, D.C.]]|access-date=February 23, 2015|quote=Alan Robert Murray and Bub Asman accepted the statue for their work on the Clint Eastwood-directed film.

Years later, Kyle has become a ranch hand and [[rodeo]] cowboy, and returns home early, to find his girlfriend in bed with another man. After telling her to leave, he is mulling it over with his brother when he sees news coverage of the [[1998 United States embassy bombings|1998 U.S. embassy bombings]] and decides to enlist in the Navy. He qualifies for special training and becomes a sniper with the [[United States Navy SEALs|U.S. Navy SEALs]].\n\nKyle meets Taya Studebaker at a bar, and the two soon marry. He is sent [[Iraq War|to Iraq]] after the [[September 11 attacks]]. His first kills are a woman and boy who attacked [[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marines]] on patrol with a Russian-made [[RKG-3 anti-tank grenade]]. Kyle is visibly upset by the experience, but later earns the nickname \"Legend\" for his many kills. Assigned to hunt for the [[al-Qaeda]] leader, [[Abu Musab al-Zarqawi]], Kyle interrogates a family whose father offers to lead the SEALs to \"The Butcher\", al-Zarqawi's second-in-command. The plan goes awry when The Butcher captures the father and his son, killing them while Kyle is pinned down by a sniper. This sniper goes by the name Mustafa and is an [[Olympic Games]] medalist from [[Syria]]. Meanwhile, the insurgents issue a bounty on Kyle.\n\nKyle returns home to his wife and the birth of his son. He is distracted by memories of his war experiences and by Taya's concern for them as a couple \u2013 she wishes he would focus on his home and family.\n\nKyle leaves for a second tour and is promoted to [[Chief petty officer (United States)|chief petty officer]]. Involved in a shootout with The Butcher, he helps in killing him. When he returns home to a newborn daughter, Kyle becomes increasingly distant from his family. On Kyle's third tour, Mustafa seriously injures a unit member, Ryan \"Biggles\" Job, and the unit is evacuated back to base. When they decide to return to the field and continue the mission, another SEAL, [[Marc Alan Lee|Marc Lee]], is killed by gunfire.\n\nGuilt compels Kyle to undertake a fourth tour, and Taya tells him she may not be there when he returns. Back in Iraq, Kyle is shocked to learn Biggles died in surgery to repair the wounds he sustained. Assigned to kill Mustafa, who has been sniping [[U.S. Army]] combat engineers building a barricade, Kyle's sniper team is placed on a rooftop inside enemy territory. Kyle spots Mustafa and takes him out with a risky long distance shot at {{convert|2,100|yd|m|0}}, but this exposes his team's position to numerous armed insurgents. In the midst of the gunfight, and low on ammunition, Kyle tearfully calls Taya and tells her he is ready to come home. A sandstorm provides cover for a chaotic escape in which Kyle is injured and almost left behind.\n\nAfter Kyle gets back, on edge and unable to adjust fully to civilian life, he is asked by a [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Veterans Affairs]] psychiatrist if he is haunted by all the things he did in war. When he replies it is \"all the guys [he] couldn't save\" that haunt him, the psychiatrist encourages him to help severely wounded veterans in the VA hospital. After that, Kyle gradually begins to adjust to home life.\n\nYears later, on February 2, 2013, Kyle says goodbye to his wife and family as he leaves in good spirits to spend time with Eddie Ray Routh, a veteran suffering from PTSD at a shooting range. An on-screen subtitle reveals that [[Murders of Chris Kyle and Chad Littlefield|Kyle was killed that day by Routh]], followed by archive footage of crowds standing along the highway for his funeral procession. More are shown attending his memorial service.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Bradley Cooper]] as [[Chris Kyle]]<ref name=\"hollywoodreporter1\">{{cite news|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/bradley-cooper-navy-seal-american-sniper-warner-bros-303006|title=Bradley Cooper Sets Up Navy SEAL Pic 'American Sniper' at Warner Bros.
