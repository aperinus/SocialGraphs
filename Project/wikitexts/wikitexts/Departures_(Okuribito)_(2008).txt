The film follows a young man who returns to his hometown after a failed career as a cellist and stumbles across work as a ''[[n\u014dkanshi|{{transliteration|ja|n\u014dkanshi}}]]''\u2014a traditional Japanese ritual mortician. He is subjected to prejudice from those around him, including from his wife, because of strong social taboos against people who deal with death. Eventually he repairs these interpersonal connections through the beauty and dignity of his work.\n\nThe idea for ''Departures'' arose after Motoki, affected by having seen a funeral ceremony along the [[Ganges]] when travelling in India, read widely on the subject of death and came across ''Coffinman''. He felt that the story would adapt well to film, and ''Departures'' was finished a decade later. Because of Japanese prejudices against those who handle the dead, distributors were reluctant to release it\u2014until a surprise grand prize win at the [[Montreal World Film Festival]] in August 2008. The following month the film opened in Japan, where it went on to win the [[Japan Academy Prize for Picture of the Year|Academy Prize for Picture of the Year]] and become the year's highest-grossing domestic film. This success was topped in 2009, when it became the first Japanese production to win the [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film]].{{efn|name=A|Before the category was formed in 1956, three Japanese films received [[Academy Honorary Award|honorary awards]]: ''[[Rashomon]]'' ([[Akira Kurosawa]]; 1951), ''[[Gate of Hell (film)|Gate of Hell]]'' ([[Teinosuke Kinugasa]]; 1954), and ''[[Samurai I: Musashi Miyamoto|Samurai, The Legend of Musashi]]'' ([[Hiroshi Inagaki]]; 1955) {{harv|MMPAJ}}. The Japanese-Soviet co-production ''[[Dersu Uzala (1975 film)|Dersu Uzala]]'' ([[Akira Kurosawa]]; 1975) won the award, but it was submitted for the Soviet Union {{harv|Armstrong}}.}}\n\n''Departures'' received positive reviews, with aggregator [[Rotten Tomatoes]] indicating an 80% approval rating from 108 reviews. Critics praised the film's humour, the beauty of the [[wikt:encoffining|encoffining]] ceremony, and the quality of the acting, but some took issue with its predictability and overt sentimentality. Reviewers highlighted a variety of themes, but focused mainly on the humanity that death brings to the surface and how it strengthens family bonds. The success of ''Departures'' led to the establishment of tourist attractions at sites connected to the film and increased interest in encoffining ceremonies, as well as adaptation of the story for various media, including [[manga]] and a stage play.\n\n==Plot==\nDaigo Kobayashi ([[Masahiro Motoki]]) loses his job as a cellist when his orchestra is disbanded. He and his wife Mika ([[Ry\u014dko Hirosue]]) move from Tokyo to his hometown in [[Yamagata Prefecture|Yamagata]], where they live in his childhood home that was left to him when his mother died two years earlier. It is fronted by a coffee shop that Daigo's father had operated before he ran off with a waitress when Daigo was six; since then the two have had no contact. Daigo feels hatred towards his father and guilt for not taking better care of his mother. He still keeps a \"stone-letter\"\u2014a stone which is said to convey meaning through its texture\u2014which his father had given him many years before.\n\nDaigo finds an advertisement for a job \"assisting departures\". Assuming it to be a job in a travel agency, he goes to the interview at the NK Agent office and learns from the secretary, Yuriko Kamimura ([[Kimiko Yo]]), that he will be preparing bodies for cremation in a ceremony known as [[wikt:encoffinment|encoffinment]]. Though reluctant, Daigo is hired on the spot and receives a cash advance from his new boss, Sasaki ([[Tsutomu Yamazaki]]). Daigo is furtive about his duties and hides the true nature of the job from Mika.\n\nHis first assignment is to assist with the encoffinment of a woman who died at home and remained undiscovered for two weeks. He is beset with nausea and later humiliated when strangers on a bus detect an unsavoury scent on him. To clean himself, he visits a [[Sent\u014d|public bath]] which he had frequented as a child. It is owned by Tsuyako Yamashita ([[Kazuko Yoshiyuki]]), the mother of one of Daigo's former classmates.\n\nOver time, Daigo becomes comfortable with his profession as he completes a number of assignments and experiences the gratitude of the families of the deceased. Though he faces social ostracism, Daigo refuses to quit, even after Mika discovers a training DVD in which he plays a corpse and leaves him to return to her parents' home in Tokyo. Daigo's former classmate Yamashita ([[Tetta Sugimoto]]) insists that the mortician find a more respectable line of work and, until then, avoids him and his family.\n\nAfter a few months, Mika returns and announces that she is pregnant. She expresses hope that Daigo will find a job of which their child can be proud. During the ensuing argument, Daigo receives a call for an encoffinment for Mrs Yamashita. Daigo prepares her body in front of both the Yamashita family and Mika, who had known the public bath owner. The ritual earns him the respect of all present, and Mika stops insisting that Daigo change jobs.\n\nSometime later, they learn of the death of Daigo's father. Daigo experiences renewed feelings of anger and tells the others at the NK office that he refuses to deal with his father's body. Feeling ashamed of having abandoned her own son long ago, Yuriko tells this to Daigo in an effort to change his mind. Daigo berates Yuriko and storms out before collecting himself and turning around. He goes with Mika to another village to see the body. Daigo is at first unable to recognize him, but takes offence when local funeral workers are careless with the body. He insists on dressing it himself, and while doing so finds a stone-letter that he had given to his father, held tight in the dead man's hands. The childhood memory of his father's face returns to him, and after he finishes the ceremony, Daigo gently presses the stone-letter to Mika's pregnant belly.\n\n==Production==\n\n===Cultural background===\n{{Main|N\u014dkanshi}}\n[[Japanese funeral]]s are highly ritualized affairs which are generally\u2014though not always\u2014conducted in accordance with [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] rites.{{sfn|Sosnoski|1996|p=70}} In preparation for the funeral, the body is washed and the orifices are blocked with cotton or gauze. The encoffining ritual (called ''n\u014dkan''), as depicted in ''Departures'', is rarely performed, and even then only in rural areas.{{sfn|Olsen 2009}} This ceremony is not standardized, but generally involves professional {{nihongo|morticians|\u7d0d\u68fa\u5e2b|n\u014dkanshi}}{{efn|Also called {{nihongo|morticians|\u6e6f\u704c\u5e2b|yukanshi}}; ''{{transliteration|ja|yukan}}'' is the ceremonial cleansing of the body that comes before the ''{{transliteration|ja|n\u014dkan}}'' proper.}} ritually preparing the body, dressing the dead in white, and sometimes applying make-up.

After coming into contact with the dead, individuals must cleanse themselves through [[Harae|purifying rituals]].{{sfn|Plutschow|1990|p = 30}} People who work closely with the dead, such as morticians, are thus considered unclean, and during the [[Feudal Japan|feudal era]] those whose work was related to death became ''[[burakumin]]'' (untouchables), forced to live in their own hamlets and discriminated against by wider society. Despite a cultural shift since the [[Meiji Restoration]] of 1868, the stigma of death still has considerable force within Japanese society, and discrimination against the untouchables has continued.{{efn|For a more detailed discussion of the position of ''kegare'' and death in Japanese society, see {{harvnb|Okuyama|2013|pp=8\u201312}}.}}{{sfn|Pharr|2006|pp=134\u2013135}}\n\nUntil 1972, most deaths were dealt with by families, funeral homes, or ''{{transliteration|ja|n\u014dkanshi}}''. {{as of|2014||}}, about 80%<!-- \"\uff18\u5272\" (eight-tenths) isn't necessarily exactly 80% --> of deaths occur in hospitals, and preparation of the bodies is frequently done by hospital staff; in such cases, the family often does not see the body until the funeral.{{sfn|Hosaka|2014|p = 58}} A 1998 survey found that 29.5% of the Japanese population believed in an afterlife, and a further 40% wanted to believe; belief was highest {{not a typo|among the young}}.

Before shooting began, Takita asked him to prepare a soundtrack which would represent the separation between Daigo and his father, as well as the mortician's love for his wife.{{sfn|Takita|2008|loc = 06:08\u201306:16}} Owing to the importance of cellos and cello music in the narrative, Hisaishi emphasized the instrument in his soundtrack;{{sfn|Nippon Academy-sh\u014d Association, 2009}} he described the challenge of centring a score around the cello as one of the most difficult things he had ever done.{{sfn|Takita|2008|loc = 06:28\u201306:50}} This score was played during shooting, which according to Takita \"allowed [the crew] to visualize many of the emotions in the film\" and thus contributed to the quality of the finished work.{{sfn|Takita|2008|loc = 06:17\u201306:28}}\n\n==Style==\nAs they are the movie's \"central dramatic piece\", the encoffining ceremonies in ''Departures'' have received extensive commentary.{{sfn|Byrnes 2009}} [[Mike Scott (film critic)|Mike Scott]], for instance, wrote in ''[[The Times-Picayune]]'' that these scenes were beautiful and heartbreaking, and Nicholas Barber of ''[[The Independent]]'' described them as \"elegant and dignified\".<ref>{{harvnb|Mike Scott 2009}}; {{harvnb|Barber 2009}}.</ref> James Adams of ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'' wrote that they were a \"dignified ritual of calming, hypnotic grace, with sleights of hand bordering on the magicianly\".{{sfn|Adams 2009}} As the film continues, Paul Byrnes of ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'' opined, the audience gains an improved knowledge of the ceremony and its importance.{{sfn|Byrnes 2009}} Viewers see that the ceremonies are not simply about preparing the body, but also about \"bring[ing] dignity to death, respect to the deceased and solace to those who grieve\", through which the encoffiners are able to help repair broken family ties and heal damage done to those left behind.{{sfn|Sharkey 2009}}\n\nThere is an idealization of the ''{{transliteration|ja|n\u014dkanshi}}'' as presented in the film. In all but one case, the dead are either young or already made-up, such that \"the viewer can easily tolerate these images on the screen\".{{sfn|Okuyama|2013|p = 5}} The one corpse that had not been found for several days is never shown on screen.{{sfn|Okuyama|2013|p = 5}} No bodies show the gaunt figure of one who has died after a long illness, or the cuts and bruises of an accident victim.{{sfn|Okuyama|2013|p = 17}} [[Japanese studies|Japanologist]] Mark R. Mullins writes that the gratitude shown in ''Departures'' would probably not have occurred in real life; according to ''Coffinman'', there \"is nothing lower on the social scale than the mortician, and the truth of the matter is that [the Japanese people] fear the coffinman and the cremator just as much as death and the corpse\".{{sfn|Mullins|2010|p = 103}}\n\n[[File:2007 Sakura of Fukushima-e 007 rotated.jpg|thumb|upright=1.0|Symbolism has been found in the film's use of [[cherry blossom]]s.]]\nIn a [[Montage (filmmaking)|montage]], scenes of Daigo playing his childhood cello while sitting outdoors are interspersed with scenes of encoffining ceremonies.

When you play the cello, the instrument has a human, curvaceous form. The cellist embraces that form when playing the instrument, very loving, affectionate. That's very similar, physically, to the actions of the encoffiner, cradling the body, being tender and gentle with it.{{sfn|Moore 2009}}}}\n\nByrnes found that ''Departures'' used the symbol of the [[cherry blossom]], a flower which blooms after the winter only to wither soon afterwards, to represent the transience of life; through this understanding, he wrote, Japanese people attempt to define their own existence. Natural symbols are further presented through the changing seasons, which \"suggest delicate emotional changes\" in the characters,{{sfn|Byrnes 2009}} as well as the letter-stones, which represent \"love, communication, [and] the baton being passed from generation to generation\".{{sfn|Takita|2008|loc = 09:35\u201309:55}} The film's settings are used to convey various sensations, including the solitude of the countryside and the intimacy of the public bath house.{{sfn|Howell 2009}} The colour white, manifested through snow, [[chrysanthemum]]s, and other objects, is prominent in the film; Okuyama suggests that this, together with the classical music and ritualized hand gestures, represents the sacredness and purity of the death ceremonies.{{sfn|Okuyama|2013|p = 8}}\n\n''Departures'' incorporates aspects of humour, an \"unexpected\" complement to the theme of death which Ebert suggested may be used to mask the audience's fears.<ref>{{harvnb|Ebert, Departures}}; {{harvnb|Mike Scott 2009}}.</ref> Betsy Sharkey of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' opines that, through this use of humour, the film avoids becoming too dark and instead acts as a \"warmhearted blend\" of whimsy and irony.{{sfn|Sharkey 2009}} This humour manifests in a variety of manners, such as a scene in which \"a mortified Daigo, naked except for a pair of adult diapers, is the reluctant model\" for an educational video regarding the encoffining process, as well as a scene in which Daigo discovers that the person he is preparing is a [[trans woman]].{{efn|According to Takita, the inclusion of a trans woman in the opening scene was to show both the \"grace and gravity of the ritual\" as well as indicate that the film would not be a \"very heavy\" one {{harv|Takita|2008|loc=03:30\u201303:55}}.}}<ref>{{harvnb|Adams 2009}}; {{harvnb|Sharkey 2009}}.</ref> Takita stated that the addition of humour was deliberate, as \"humans are comical by nature\", and that the humour did not conflict with the film's darker themes.{{sfn|Blair 2009, Departures (Japan)}}\n\n==Themes==\nSeveral critics discussed the theme of death found in ''Departures''. Scott highlighted the contrast between the taboo of death and the value of jobs related to it. He also noted the role of the encoffiner in showing \"one last act of compassion\" by presenting the dead in a way which preserved proud memories of their life.{{sfn|Mike Scott 2009}} Initially, Daigo and his family are unable to overcome the taboos and their squeamishness when faced with death. Daigo is alienated from his wife and friends owing to traditional values.{{sfn|Howell 2009}} Ultimately it is through his work with the dead that Daigo finds fulfilment, and, as Peter Howell of the ''[[Toronto Star]]'' concluded, viewers realize that \"death may be the termination of a life, but it's not the end of humanity\".{{sfn|Howell 2009}} Okuyama writes that, in the end, the film (and the book on which it was based) serves as a \"quiet yet persistent protest\" against the discrimination which people who deal with death continue to face in modern Japan: death is a normal part of life, not something repulsive.{{sfn|Okuyama|2013|p = 10}}\n\nAlong with this theme of death, Takita believed ''Departures'' was about life, about finding a lost sense of feeling human;{{sfn|Handa|2010|p = 74}} Daigo gains a greater perspective on life and realises the diversity of people's lives only after encountering them in death.<ref>{{harvnb|Katsuta|2008|p=11}}; {{harvnb|Iwata|2008|p=8}}.</ref> This life includes family bonds: Daigo's coming to terms with his father is a major motif, encoffinment scenes focus on the living family members rather than the dead, and even in the NK Agent office, conversation often revolves around family issues. Mika's pregnancy is the catalyst for her reconciliation with Daigo.{{sfn|Tanabe|2009|p = 9}}\n\nEbert writes that, as with other Japanese films such as ''[[Tokyo Story]]'' ([[Yasujir\u014d Ozu]]; 1953) and ''[[The Funeral (1984 film)|The Funeral]]'' ([[Juzo Itami]]; 1984), ''Departures'' focuses on the effect of death on the survivors; the afterlife is not given much discussion.<ref>{{harvnb|Ebert, Great Movies}}; {{harvnb|Ebert, Departures}}.</ref> He considered this indicative of a \"deep and unsensational acceptance of death\" in Japanese culture, one which is to be met not with extreme sorrow, but with contemplation.{{sfn|Ebert, Departures}} Takita stated that he intended to focus on the \"dialogue between people who have passed away and the families that survive them\".{{sfn|Blair 2009, Departures (Japan)}} The film touches on the question of the afterlife: the cremator likens death to \"a gateway\", and Okuyama writes that in this sense the cremator is a gatekeeper and the encoffiners are guides.{{sfn|Okuyama|2013|p = 13}}\n\nByrnes found that ''Departures'' leads one to question the extent of modernity's effect on Japanese culture, noting the undercurrent of \"traditional attitudes and values\" which permeated the film. Although the encoffining ceremony was traditionally completed by the dead person's family, a decreased interest in it opened a \"niche market\" for professional encoffiners.{{sfn|Byrnes 2009}} Okuyama wrote that, through this film, Takita was filling a \"spiritual loss\" caused by the departure from tradition in modern Japan.{{sfn|Okuyama|2013|p = 18}} [[Tadao Sato]] connected this theme of modernity to that of death, explaining that the film's unusually non-bitter treatment of death demonstrated an evolution in Japanese feelings about life and death. He considered the film's treatment of ''{{transliteration|ja|n\u014dkan}}'' as an artistic rather than religious ceremony to reflect the agnostic attitudes of modern Japan.{{sfn|Tanabe|2009|p = 9}}\n\n==Release==\n\nThe taboo subject of ''Departures'' made prospective distributors wary of taking on the film.{{sfn|Takabe|Wakatsuki|2009|p = 203}} Surveys conducted at pre-release screenings placed it at the bottom of the list of films audiences wanted to see.{{sfn|Takabe|Wakatsuki|2009|p = 203}} Ultimately, the film's debut at the [[Montreal World Film Festival]] in August 2008, which was rewarded with the festival's grand prize, provided the necessary incentive for distributors to select ''Departures''; it finally received its domestic Japanese release on 13 September 2008.<ref>{{harvnb|Kinema Junpo}}; {{harvnb|Schilling 2009, Producer}}; {{harvnb|Blair 2009, Yojiro Takita}}; {{harvnb|Kilday 2009, Regent}}.</ref> Even then, owing to the strong taboo against death, Takita was worried about the film's reception and did not anticipate commercial success, and others expressed concern that the film lacked a clear target audience.<ref>{{harvnb|Tourtellotte|Reynolds|2009}}; {{harvnb|Schilling 2009, Producer}}.</ref>\n\nThis fear was misplaced; ''Departures'' debuted in Japan at fifth place, and during the fifth week of its run hit its peak position at third place.{{sfn|Takabe|Wakatsuki|2009|p = 203}} It sold 2.6 million tickets in Japan and generated 3.2 billion [[Japanese yen|yen]] ($32 million) in box office revenue in the five months after its debut.<ref>{{harvnb|Eiga Ranking Dot Com staff}}; {{harvnb|Blair 2009, 'Departures' welcomed}}; {{harvnb|Schilling 2009, Funereal flick}}.</ref> The film was still showing in 31 theatres when its success at the [[Academy Awards]] in February 2009 renewed interest; the number of screens on which it was showing was increased to 188 and the film earned another \u00a52.8 billion ($28 million), making a total of \u00a56 billion ($60 million).

O. Scott]] wrote in ''[[The New York Times]]'' that the film was \"perfectly mediocre\", predictable, and banal in its combination of humour and melodrama. Despite its sometimes touching moments, he considered ''Departures'' \"interesting mainly as an index of the Academy\u2019s hopelessly timid and conventional tastes\".{{sfn|A. O. Scott 2009}} [[Tony Rayns]] of ''[[Film Comment]]'' gave a scathing review in which he denounced the script as \"embarrassingly clunky and obvious\", the acting as merely \"adequate\", and the film as but a \"paean to the good-looking corpse\".{{sfn|Rayns 2009}} Adams gave ''Departures'' two out of four stars, praising the emotionally and visually arresting scenes of encoffinments and \"loving attention to the textures, tastes and behaviours of semi-rural Japan\" but condemning the predictability of the plot; he wrote that \"Forty-five minutes in, [viewers have] prepared a mental checklist of every turn that Daigo Kobayashi will face, then negotiate&nbsp;\u2013 and be danged if Takita doesn't deliver on every one\".{{sfn|Adams 2009}}\n\n===Awards===\n{{Main|List of accolades received by Departures (2008 film)|l1=List of accolades received by ''Departures'' (2008 film)}}\nAt the [[32nd Japan Academy Prize]] ceremony held in February 2009, ''Departures'' dominated the competition.
