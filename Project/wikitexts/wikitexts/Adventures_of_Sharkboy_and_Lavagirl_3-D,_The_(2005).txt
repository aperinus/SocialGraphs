The production companies were [[Dimension Films]], [[Columbia Pictures]] and [[Troublemaker Studios]].<ref name=\"RottenTomatoes\" /> The film uses the [[anaglyph 3D]] technology, similar to the one used in ''[[Spy Kids 3-D: Game Over]]'' (2003). The film stars [[Taylor Lautner]], Taylor Dooley, [[Cayden Boyd]], [[David Arquette]], [[Kristin Davis]] and [[George Lopez]]. Many of the concepts and much of the story were conceived by Rodriguez's children. The film received negative reviews from critics, with much of the criticism directed at the film's story and poor 3-D, while the visual aspects and performances received some praise. The film also underperformed at the box office earning just $39.2 million in the United States and $32.8 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $72 million worldwide on a $50 million budget.\n\nThe special effects were done by [[Hybride Technologies]], CafeFX, [[The Orphanage (company)|The Orphanage]], Post Logic, [[Hydraulx|Hy*drau*lx]], [[Industrial Light & Magic]], R!ot Pictures, [[Tippett Studio]], Amalgamated Pixels, [[Intelligent Creatures]] and Troublemaker Digital.\n\nAnother film featuring Sharkboy and Lavagirl titled ''[[We Can Be Heroes (film)|We Can Be Heroes]]'' was released on [[Netflix]] on December 25, 2020 with Dooley reprising her role.\n\n==Plot==\n{{Long plot|date=April 2022}}\nMax is a lonely 10-year-old boy living in the suburbs of [[Austin, Texas|Austin]]. In his imagination he has created a dream world named Planet Drool, where his dreams come to life. It contains two main characters: Sharkboy, who was raised by sharks after losing his father (a marine biologist) at sea, and became a shark-hybrid himself, and Lavagirl, who can produce fire and lava but has trouble controlling her power, so that objects often catch fire when she touches them. The pair act as protectors of Planet Drool. In the real world, Max's parents have little time for him, and their marriage is not going well. At school, he is bullied by his classmate Linus. He does receive some friendship from Marissa, the daughter of the teacher, Mr. Electricidad. Linus steals Max's dream journal and threatens to \"make changes\" to it. The next day, twin tornadoes form outside the school. Sharkboy and Lavagirl emerge from the storm and ask Max to accompany them to Planet Drool, which he learns is turning bad thanks to Mr. Electric, a robot resembling Mr. Electricidad and the dreamworld's now-corrupt electrician, under the orders of an unknown mastermind. They travel to Planet Drool with the Shark Rocket with an autopilot control. Max then realizes that he has never come up with a landing function.\n\nThey confront Mr. Electric in his lair, but he drops them into the Dream Graveyard, where many of Max's dreams have been dumped. They find Tobor, a robot toy that Max never finished building after being discouraged by his father. Tobor carries them to other parts of the planet. The three of them bond during their journey, but they face hardships, such as Sharkboy's anger that the oceans are frozen over, and Lavagirl's desperation to find her true purpose on Planet Drool. They are pursued by Mr. Electric and his evil plug-hounds. They plan to reach the Ice Princess and obtain the Crystal Heart, with which they could freeze time, giving them enough time to get to the center of Planet Drool and for Max to fix the dreamworld by re-dreaming it. Instead, they are captured by Mr. Electric and delivered to the mastermind, who is revealed to be Minus, a villain resembling Linus who has altered Max's journal and hence the dreamworld. Minus traps them in a cage. Sharkboy becomes enraged by bubbles who laugh and sing along with a silly song and destroys the cage in a \"shark frenzy\". Max retrieves his dream journal while Minus is sleeping. Reading the book, Max informs Sharkboy that his father is still alive, but when Lavagirl wishes to learn what it says about her true identity, she grabs the book, and it burns to ash. In a desperate rage, Lavagirl asks Max why he made her out of lava and runs off. Max wants to follow, but Sharkboy tells him to let her cool down.\n\nThe three eventually reach the Ice Princess, who resembles Marissa. She hands over the Crystal Heart, but they are unable to stop the corruption, since the Ice Princess is the only one who can use the Crystal Heart's power and cannot leave her home. Afterwards, Mr. Electric knocks Sharkboy unconscious by tricking him into jumping into water filled with [[electric eel]]s, which are his weakness. Lavagirl sacrifices herself by jumping into the water to retrieve him. Max realizes he has been selfish in wanting to get back to Earth. Tobor appears and convinces Max to dream a better, unselfish dream. Just then, Sharkboy regains consciousness and races Lavagirl to a volcano to revive her. Max realizes that Lavagirl's purpose is as a light against the darkness which has engulfed Planet Drool. Max becomes the Daydreamer and gains reality-warping powers to defeat Minus. He then offers that the two join to make a better dreamworld, and Minus agrees. Lavagirl thanks Max and Sharkboy for saving her.\n\nMinus offers to let Mr. Electric return to running Planet Drool, but Mr. Electric reveals that he never enjoyed doing so in the first place. He tells Max that he made a terrible mistake of dreaming him up and flies to Earth to kill Max while he is dreaming. Max awakens back in his classroom during the tornado storm. Mr. Electric arrives in the tornado in front of the class and an astonished Mr. Electricidad. Max's parents are caught in the tornado but are saved by Sharkboy and Lavagirl. Max gives the Crystal Heart to Marissa so she can use the Ice Princess's powers to freeze and destroy Mr. Electric. Mr. Electricidad, Linus, and Max make peace with one another, and Max reunites with his now-reconciled parents.\n\nLater, Max informs his class that Planet Drool is a proper dreamworld once again, that Sharkboy is now King of the Ocean and that Lavagirl is Queen of Earth's Volcanoes. As the film shows Max finally finishing Tobor, he reminds the class (and the audience) to \"dream a better dream, and work to make it real\".\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Cayden Boyd]] as Max.

Max's father is an unemployed writer. They are on the brink of a divorce. They mean well for Max, but are unable to solve his problems.

Mr. Electricidad is Max's teacher. Mr. Electric is Planet Drool's corrupt electrician. Tobor is an unfinished robot of Max that resided in the Dream Graveyard.

He is a bully at Max's school and steals his Dream Journal. With it, he enters Max's dreamworld and, using the name \"Minus\" (a nickname bestowed by Mr. Electricidad for Linus' habit of disliked conduct), alters it to his version before ultimately befriending Max.\n* [[Sasha Pieterse]] as Marissa Electricidad / Ice Princess. Marissa is the daughter of Mr. Electricidad, and at first, the only student who befriends Max. On Planet Drool, she appears as the Ice Princess, the ruler of the Ice Kingdom and keeper of the Crystal Heart, a necklace she wears that can freeze anything including time.\n\nDirector [[Robert Rodriguez]] has an uncredited role voicing a shark, and his children, Rebel and Racer, portray Sharkboy at age five and age seven respectively. Rico Torres portrays Sharkboy's father. Marc Musso and Shane Graham play children at Max's school.\n\n==Production==\nParts of the film were shot on location in Texas from September to December 2004, where Max resides and goes to school in the film. Much of the film was shot in a studio against green screen. Most of the ships, landscapes and other effects including some creatures and characters, were accomplished digitally. According to Lautner and Dooley, when filming the scene with the dream train, the front part of the train was an actual physical set piece. \"The whole inside was there and when they have all the gadgets you can pull on, that was all there but everything else was a green screen,\" said Dooley.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.teenhollywood.com/d.asp?r=99961&cat=1038&p=7 | title=Hangin' with Sharkboy, Lavagirl....and Max | access-date = August 17, 2021 | last = Barker | first = Lynn | date = June 8, 2005 | publisher = TeenHollywood.com |url-status = dead |archive-url = https://archive.today/QDrx | archive-date = September 12, 2012 }}</ref>\nEleven visual effects companies ([[Hybride Technologies]], CafeFX, [[The Orphanage (company)|The Orphanage]], Post Logic, [[Hydraulx|Hy*drau*lx]], [[Industrial Light & Magic]], R!ot Pictures, [[Tippett Studio]], Amalgamated Pixels and [[Intelligent Creatures]] and Rodriguez's Texas-based Troublemaker Digital) worked on the film in order to accomplish over 1,000 visual effect shots.<ref name=\"DiLullo\">{{cite web | url = http://mag.awn.com/index.php?article_no=2520&ltype=cat | title = Shark Boy and Lava Girl: Back to 3D | access-date = August 9, 2008 | last = DiLullo | first = Tara | date = June 10, 2005 | publisher = Animation World Magazine | url-status = dead | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20081207031559/http://mag.awn.com/index.php?article_no=2520&ltype=cat | archive-date = December 7, 2008 | df = mdy-all }}</ref>\n\n[[Robert Rodriguez]] appears in the credits fourteen times, most notably as director, a producer, a screenwriter (along with Marcel Rodriguez), visual effects supervisor, director of photography, editor, a camera operator, and a composer and performer.
