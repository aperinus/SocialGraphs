It was released internationally in 2004. The film was directed and written by [[Byambasuren Davaa]] and [[Luigi Falorni]]. The plot is about a family of [[nomad]]ic [[shepherd]]s in the [[Gobi Desert]] trying to save the life of a rare white [[bactrian camel]] (''Camelus bactrianus'') {{linktext|calf}} after it was rejected by its mother.\n\n==Plot==\nDuring Spring, a family of nomadic shepherds assists the births of their camel herd. The last camel to calve this season has a protracted labor that persists for two days. With the assistance and intervention of the family, a rare white calf is born. This is the mother camel's first calving. Despite the efforts of the shepherds, the mother rejects the newborn, refusing it her milk and failing to establish a care-bond with it.\n\nTo restore harmony between the mother and calf, the nomadic family call upon the services of a group of [[lama]]s who perform a ritual with bread or dough 'effigies' ({{lang-bo|[[torma]]}}) of the mother, the calf and the individual members of the family. The rite opens with the sound of a [[conch#As musical instruments|sacred conchshell horn]] followed by bells in the hands of lamas, some of whom wield ''[[vajra]]''. The rite takes place with members of the extended nomadic community and a number of lama at a [[shrine|sacred place]] that consists of one end of a log, or wooden pole, set in the earth, with the other end raised to the sky: a stylized 'victory banner' ({{lang-sa|[[Dhvaja]]}}) with a piece of blue fabric entwined around it, functioning as a [[prayer flag]] (darchor-style). The log is supported by a [[cairn]] of rocks at its base as foundation. The ritual, however, does not re-establish harmony between the mother and calf.\n\nThe family then resolve to secure the services of an indigenous 'violinist' to play the music for a [[Mongolia]]n 'Hoos'{{efn|Hoos, sometime khoos, kh\u00f6\u00f6sl\u00f6kh, etc. - The Mongolian ''inge kh\u00f6\u00f6sl\u00f6kh'' is a coaxing ritual for camels, now inscribed in the UNESCO Heritage List<ref>[https://ethnologist.info/section/world-resorts/central-asia/mongolia/mongolian-coaxing-ritual-for-camels-has-been-inscribed-in-the-unesco-heritage-list/ Mongolian \u00b4coaxing ritual for camels\u00b4 has been inscribed in the UNESCO Heritage List]  Tereza Hejzlarov\u00e1, 15 March 2017 ''ethnologist.info'', accessed 2 December 2020</ref>}} ritual. They send their two young boys on a journey through the desert to the community [[marketplace]] to locate a musician. The 'violinist' \u2014who plays more precisely a [[morin khuur]] \u2014 is summoned to the camp and a [[ritual]] of [[folk music]] and chanting is enacted.  The musician first drapes the morin khuur on the first hump of the camel to establish a [[sympathetic magic]]al linkage between the mother and the state of harmony represented by the instrument. Once this is done he removes the instrument and commences playing. As the musician sounds the Mongolian 'violin', the female family member who lulled her child to sleep with a [[lullaby]] earlier in the documentary, repeatedly intones the calming sounds and beautiful melody of the 'hoos'. At this point, the mother camel starts to weep, tears visibly streaming from her eyes. Immediately after the rite the mother and calf are reconciled and the calf draws milk from her teat.\n\n{{reflist|group=lower-alpha}}\n\n==Reception==\n''The Story of the Weeping Camel'' received generally positive reviews; on [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film holds a 94% 'fresh' rating, based on 103 reviews, and an average rating of 7.57/10, with the consensus \"Delightful and strangely moving\";<ref>{{Rotten Tomatoes|story_of_the_weeping_camel|The Story of the Weeping Camel}}</ref> on [[Metacritic]], which uses an average of all 30 critics' reviews, the film has an 81/100, indicating \"universal acclaim\".<ref>{{Metacritic film|title=The Story of the Weeping Camel}}</ref>\n\n==Honours and awards==\nThe documentary was nominated for an [[Academy Award|Oscar]] in the category [[Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature|Best Documentary]] at the [[77th Academy Awards]].<ref name=\"NY Times\">{{cite web |url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/291862/The-Story-of-the-Weeping-Camel/details |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090726132757/http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/291862/The-Story-of-the-Weeping-Camel/details |url-status=dead |archive-date=26 July 2009 |department=Movies & TV Dept. |work=[[The New York Times]] |publisher=[[Baseline (database)|Baseline]] & [[All Movie Guide]] |date=2009 |title=The Story of the Weeping Camel (2003) |accessdate=22 July 2012 }}</ref>\n\n*International Film Critics Award, 2004 [[San Francisco International Film Festival]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fipresci.org/festivals/archive/2004/san_francisco/sf_bnanay.htm |title=''The Story of the Weeping Camel''.
