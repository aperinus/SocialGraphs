The film stars [[Hugh Grant]], [[Julianne Moore]], [[Tom Arnold (actor)|Tom Arnold]], [[Joan Cusack]], [[Jeff Goldblum]], and [[Robin Williams]]. It is a remake of the French film ''[[Neuf mois]]'' and served as Grant's first US starring role. It was filmed on location in the [[San Francisco Bay Area]]. The original music score was composed by [[Hans Zimmer]]. It was released on July 14, 1995, received mixed reviews from critics, and grossed $138 million worldwide.\n\n==Plot==\nChild psychologist Samuel Faulkner is in a long-term relationship with ballet teacher Rebecca Taylor. This all changes when Rebecca declares she is pregnant, and when questioned by Samuel about her birth control, she replies that birth control is only 97% effective.\n\nSamuel's fears mount due to his encounters with overbearing couple Marty and Gail Dwyer and their three young unruly daughters, as well as the confusing advice he gets from Sean, his perpetually single artist friend and Gail's brother. Samuel is confused and unsure about what to do. Feeling that Samuel is not ready to be a father, Rebecca leaves him and moves in with Marty and Gail (who is also pregnant with a fourth child). Samuel tries to contact her, but she ignores him. Sean encourages him to move on, with Samuel trying new things like rollerblading, getting an earring, and going to parties, but the thought of Rebecca still weighs heavy on his mind.\n\nWhen a woman makes a move on Samuel at a party, he declines, saying that he is not ready to move on yet. He later views an [[ultrasound]] of his soon-to-be-born son and decides that it is time to take responsibility before it is too late. He sells his Porsche, buys a family car, and gets back together with Rebecca, much to Gail's delight.\n\nSamuel and Rebecca then get married and not long afterward, they go out to dinner. During an awkward moment where they bump into the woman he met earlier at the party, Rebecca goes into labor. They rush to the hospital, where they meet Marty and Gail; who has gone into labor as well. Rebecca gives birth to their baby boy named Samuel Jr. and Gail gives birth to their fourth daughter named Becky.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Hugh Grant]] as Samuel Faulkner\n* [[Julianne Moore]] as Rebecca Taylor-Faulkner\n* [[Tom Arnold (actor)|Tom Arnold]] as Marty Dwyer\n* [[Joan Cusack]] as Gail Dwyer\n* [[Jeff Goldblum]] as Sean Fletcher\n* [[Robin Williams]] as Dr. Kosevich\n* Mia Cottet as Lili\n* Joey Simmrin as Truman\n* [[Ashley Johnson (actress)|Ashley Johnson]] as Shannon Dwyer\n* [[Alexa Vega]] as Molly Dwyer\n* Aislin Roche as Patsy Dwyer\n* [[Zelda Williams]] as Little Girl No. 3 in Ballet Class\n* [[Charles Martinet]] as Arnie\n* [[Kristin Davis]] as Tennis Attendant\n* Priscilla Alden as Older Woman\n* [[Betsy Aidem]] as Gail's Nurse \n}}\n\n== Production ==\n''Nine Months'' was filmed in the [[San Francisco]] area, including [[Marin County]], [[Napa Valley]], and [[Oakland]], beginning in October 1994.<ref>{{cite news |date=1995 |author=PAUL WILLISTEIN |newspaper=[[The Morning Call]] |title=A LABOR OF LOVE DIRECTOR CHRIS COLUMBUS IMITATES LIFE IN 'NINE MONTHS' |url=https://www.mcall.com/news/mc-xpm-1995-07-14-3054596-story.html |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.today/20210824034703/https://www.mcall.com/news/mc-xpm-1995-07-14-3054596-story.html |archive-date=2021-08-24 |access-date=2021-06-28 }}</ref>\n\n===Music===\n* \"The Time of Your Life\"\n** Written by [[Steve Van Zandt]]\n** Performed by [[Little Steven]]\n* \"[[These Are the Days (Van Morrison song)|These Are the Days]]\"\n** Written and Performed by [[Van Morrison]]\n* \"[[Let's Get It On]]\"\n** Written by [[Marvin Gaye]] and [[Ed Townsend]]\n** Performed by Marvin Gaye\n* \"[[Baby, I Love You]]\"\n** Written by [[Phil Spector]], [[Ellie Greenwich]] and [[Jeff Barry]]\n** Performed by [[The Ronettes]]\n* \"[[Turn Back the Hands of Time]]\"\n** Written by Bonnie F.

And the scale was inhuman to my standards, you know the scale of the production, [[20th Century Fox]], the whole thing.
