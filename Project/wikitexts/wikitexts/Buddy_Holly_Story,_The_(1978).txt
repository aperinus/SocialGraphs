It features an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]]-winning musical score, adapted by [[Joe Renzetti]] and [[Academy Awards|Oscar]]-nominated lead performance by [[Gary Busey]]. The film also stars [[Don Stroud]], [[Charles Martin Smith]], [[Conrad Janis]], [[William Jordan (actor)|William Jordan]], and [[Maria Richwine]], who played [[Maria Elena Holly]].\n\nIt was adapted by [[Robert Gittler]] from ''Buddy Holly: His Life and Music'', the 1975 biography of Holly by John Goldrosen, and was directed by [[Steve Rash]].\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1956, Buddy Holly and his friends, drummer Jesse Charles and bass player Ray Bob Simmons, regularly performed at a local roller rink in [[Lubbock, Texas]], as [[The Crickets]]. A local radio station broadcasts the show. Buddy plays a country song, then switches to a rock and roll song, exciting the teens but drawing the ire of the radio station's sponsor. Station manager Riley tells Buddy that [[Coral Records]] vice president wants the band to make a recording in [[Nashville, Tennessee]].\n\nAt the recording studio, Buddy walks out when his rock-and-roll vision clashes with the producers, who want [[The Crickets]] to play country music. Later, Riley says he sent a tape of the Cricket's roller rink performance to [[New York City]] music producer Ross Turner. Believing the demo tape is a master copy, Turner releases it without realizing the band has not yet signed a contract. The record is a hit and Buddy can now pursue music full time. In New York City, the Crickets meet with Turner; after initial resistance, he agrees that Buddy can make music how he wants.\n\nSol Gittler books the Crickets for the famous [[Apollo Theater]] in [[Harlem]], assuming they are a black band. He is stunned when three white Texans show up, and he refuses to let them perform, fearing the all-black audience's reaction. Buddy points out that Gittler's telegram specifies that they only have to be in New York City for a week to be paid $1000, so Gittler nervously allows them to perform, the first white act to perform at the Apollo. After an uncomfortable start, Buddy's music soon wins over the audience and the Crickets are a hit.\n\nTurner's secretary, [[Mar\u00eda Elena Holly|Maria Elena Santiago]], catches Buddy's eye, but their budding romance is nearly ended when her strict aunt refuses to allow them to date. Buddy convinces her to change her mind, and on their first date, Buddy proposes to Maria. She accepts and they are soon married.\n\nAfter two years of success, Ray Bob, and Jesse, feeling overshadowed by Buddy and wanting to return to Texas, decide to quit while Buddy believes it is necessary to remain in New York to stay popular. After appearing on [[CBS]] TV on ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'', Jesse and Ray Bob return to Lubbock with the agreement that they will retain the Crickets name. Though saddened by their departure, Buddy carries on writing. He initially fears performing without them despite his manager's emphasizing that touring is necessary to chart success. Buddy is delighted when Maria becomes pregnant, though she sees he is frustrated professionally and urges him to go on tour.\n\nOn February 2, 1959, preparing for a concert at [[Clear Lake, Iowa]], Buddy charters a private plane to fly to [[Moorhead, Minnesota]] for the next concert after the tour bus has broken down. [[The Big Bopper]] and [[Ritchie Valens]] join him on the flight. Meanwhile, the Crickets, feeling nostalgic and wanting to revive the band, plan to join Buddy at his next tour stop. After playing his final song, \"[[Not Fade Away (song)|Not Fade Away]]\", Holly bids the crowd farewell. A caption reveals that Holly, Valens, and the Bopper died in a plane crash [[The Day the Music Died|that night]] \"... and the rest is Rock 'n Roll.\"\n\n==Cast==\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n! Actor !!

Busey, in particular, was noted for recording the soundtrack music live and for losing a considerable amount of weight in order to portray the skinny Holly. According to Busey's biography, he lost 32 pounds to look more like Holly, who weighed 146&nbsp;pounds at the time of his death.\n\nThe actor's accurate portrayal was aided by knowledge gained from a previous attempt to film part of the Holly life story, the ill-fated ''Three-Sided Coin'', in which he played Crickets drummer Jerry Allison. The film was cancelled by [[20th Century Fox]] due to pressure from Fred Bauer and his company, who had made deals with the Holly [[Estate (law)|estate]].<ref>[http://www.sonymoviechannel.com/movies/buddy-holly-story/details ''The Buddy Holly Story'' Details.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140824185433/http://www.sonymoviechannel.com/movies/buddy-holly-story/details |date=2014-08-24 }} ''Sony Movie Channel''. Retrieved August 22, 2014.</ref> The screenplay of ''Three-Sided Coin'' (by Allison and Tom Drake) revealed many personal details about Holly, and Busey picked up more during off-set conversations with Allison.\n\nWhile the story follows Buddy Holly from age 20 to 22 (1956 to February 1959), Busey was 33 when he played the role. Charles Martin Smith auditioned for the role of Buddy, but since Busey already had been cast, the producers cast Martin to play Ray Bob Simmons because they liked his audition. Simmons and Jesse Charles were character names used in place of [[Joe B. Mauldin]] and [[J.I. Allison]], two of the actual Crickets (1956 to early 1958 Cricket [[Niki Sullivan]], performing on 27 of the 32 songs Holly recorded, is not shown).\n\nThe incident in which a Buffalo disc jockey locked himself in a studio and repeatedly played the same song over and over was loosely based on real-life stunts orchestrated by disc jockey [[Tom Clay]] (and repeated a few years later by [[Danny Neaverth]]), who held up Buffalo's Shelton Square by playing [[Bill Haley & His Comets]]' \"[[Rock Around the Clock]]\" repeatedly from the top of a billboard, and by [[Joey Reynolds]], who locked himself in a studio playing \"[[Sherry (song)|Sherry]]\" by [[The Four Seasons (band)|The Four Seasons]] for several hours; those incidents, however, had no relation to Buddy Holly or his music.\n\n==Release==\nThe film had a special premiere in nine different Texas and Oklahoma cities on May 18, 1978, including Holly's hometown of [[Lubbock, Texas|Lubbock]] and Busey's hometown of [[Tulsa, Oklahoma|Tulsa]],<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Big Texas Preem: 'Buddy Holly Story' P.A.'s Plus Radio|magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=May 10, 1978|page=40}}</ref> before opening in Los Angeles on June 14.<ref>Grant, Lee (May 17, 1978). \"'Holly Story' Right in Tune\".

Being interviewed and involved in the production of director Richard Spence's documentary 'The Real Story of Buddy Holly', McCartney decided after seeing the film to make a more accurate account of what happened. In a ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' interview, executive producer Ed Cohen, director Steve Rash and producer Freddy Bauer defended inaccuracies in the movie, pointing out the budget of the movie was only two million dollars. \"Whatever we put up there on the screen will be the truth\", commented Bauer. \"Ask moviegoers who invented the telephone. They'll tell you that [[Don Ameche]] did.\" According to ''Rolling Stone'', the three major complaints concerned the portrayal of Holly's family, the treatment of the Crickets and the omission of Norman Petty, Holly's producer.<ref name=\"RollingStone\" />\n\n===Awards===\nThe film won the [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Best Adaptation Score]] by [[Joe Renzetti]].
