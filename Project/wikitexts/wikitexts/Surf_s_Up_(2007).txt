Directed by [[Ash Brannon]] and [[Chris Buck]], the film features the voices of [[Shia LaBeouf]], [[Jeff Bridges]], [[Zooey Deschanel]], [[Jon Heder]], [[Mario Cantone]], [[James Woods]], and [[Diedrich Bader]]. It is a parody of surfing documentaries, such as ''[[The Endless Summer]]'' and ''[[Riding Giants]]'', with parts of the plot parodying ''[[North Shore (1987 film)|North Shore]]''. Real-life surfers [[Kelly Slater]] and [[Rob Machado]] have vignettes as their penguin surfer counterparts. To obtain the desired hand-held documentary feel, the film's animation team motion-captured a physical camera operator's moves.\n\nThe film was released on June 8, 2007 by [[Sony Pictures Releasing]] through [[Columbia Pictures]], and received generally positive reviews from critics, with praise for the animation and humor.<ref name=\"RT\" /> The film grossed $152 million during its theatrical run against a budget of $100 million.<ref>{{Cite web|last=|first=|date=|title=07q1_sony.pdf|url=https://www.sony.net/SonyInfo/IR/library/presen/er/07q1_sony.pdf|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=January 15, 2021|website=Sony}}</ref> It was nominated at the [[80th Academy Awards]] for [[Academy Award for Best Animated Feature|Best Animated Feature]], but lost to Disney and Pixar\u2019s ''[[Ratatouille (film)|Ratatouille]]''.

En route to the contest, Cody befriends another entrant, Chicken Joe, a nice, but dim-witted [[rooster]] surfer from [[Sheboygan, Wisconsin]].\n\nThe entrants arrive at Pen-Gu Island, where Cody meets and immediately falls in love with Lani Aliikai, a female [[gentoo penguin]] who is a [[lifeguard]]. He also meets the contest's arrogant champion, Tank \"The Shredder\" Evans, who has won the Big Z Memorial nine times since it was first held after Z's presumed death during a previous match ten years ago. Cody sees Tank vandalizing Big Z's [[memorial]] and immediately challenges him to a surfing duel. Tank wins the duel while Cody nearly drowns and is stung by a [[sea urchin]] named Ivan. Lani rescues him and takes him to her uncle, \"Geek\", to help Cody recover from his injuries. Cody wakes up, but cannot find the souvenir necklace given to him as a child by Big Z. Geek then finds it in his hut.\n\nWhile returning the necklace, Geek finds Cody sitting on a [[Acacia koa|koa]] log and offers to help him make a [[surfboard]]. They attempt to take the log back to Geek's house, only to lose control of it and end up on a [[beach]] far away from the house. When Cody gets to the beach, he discovers a [[shack]] full of old trophies and surfboards, which used to belong to Big Z. After observing Geek walking sadly into the shack, he realizes that Geek is actually Big Z himself. Thrilled, Cody asks him to teach him how to surf. Z reluctantly agrees, but tells Cody he has to make his own board first. The attempt does not go well, however, as an impatient Cody refuses to listen to Z's advice and crafts a weak and unstable board that shatters upon hitting the water. Angry, Cody storms off and runs into Lani, who eventually persuades him to return. Cody spends the night working patiently on a new board.\n\nZ compliments Cody on his new board, and Cody is eager to start training. Z instead has him do menial tasks seemingly unrelated to surfing. Finally, when Cody starts having fun, Z and Lani teach him how to surf the waves. Afterwards, Cody asks Z if he will come watch the contest, but Z refuses, revealing that he faked his death because he realized he couldn't compete with his then-new rival Tank, and that he had become too focused on winning. Not impressed that Z gave up, Cody throws the necklace Z gave him into the sea, meets up with Joe, and gets back to the contest just as it begins.\n\nTank makes it to the finals, as do Cody and Joe. In the semifinals, Tank battles with Cody, with Tank trying to throw him off his board, but Tank falls off his own board and loses. During the finals, however, Tank appears and tries to knock Joe off his board. Cody intervenes at the last minute, sending himself and Tank into an area of the beach known as the Boneyards, which consists of dangerously sharp rock outcroppings and has killed many surfers who have ventured there. Tank punches Cody off his board before crashing, and is rescued by Lani. Z, who had secretly been watching Cody's performance, rescues Cody from a gigantic wave and helps him get back to the beach safely.\n\nZ and Cody find out that Joe won by default since Tank and Cody were disqualified. However, Cody accepts the loss, having decided he would rather just have fun instead. Z reveals himself to the spectators and invites all of them to surf at his beach, where he joins Cody in tube-riding. Cody finishes his interview with a reflection of the past events and then joins the rest of his friends in the water.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Shia LaBeouf]] as Cody Maverick, a 17-year old teenage [[rockhopper penguin]] who dreams of being a [[surfer]].\n* [[Jeff Bridges]] as Zeke \"Big Z/Geek\" Topanga, Cody's idol and a famous surfer [[emperor penguin]].\n* [[Zooey Deschanel]] as Lani Aliikai, a [[Gentoo penguin]] lifeguard and Cody's love interest.\n* [[Jon Heder]] as Chicken Joe, a friendly, airheaded [[rooster]] from [[Wisconsin]].\n* [[Mario Cantone]] as Mikey Abromowitz, a talent scout [[shorebird]].\n* [[James Woods]] as Reggie Belafonte, a short-tempered [[Sea Otter]], the competition promoter.\n* [[Diedrich Bader]] as Tank \"The Shredder\" Evans, a [[king penguin]] and Cody's rival.\n* [[Dana Belben]] as Edna Maverick, Cody's mother.\n* [[Brian Posehn]] as Glen Maverick, Cody's older brother.\n* [[Kelly Slater]] as the penguin version of himself\n* [[Rob Machado]] as the penguin version of himself\n* [[Ash Brannon]] as himself\n* [[Chris Buck]] as himself\n* [[Selema Masekela|Sal Masekela]] as himself\n* Ryder Buck as Arnold\n* Reese Elowe as Kate\n* Jack P.

It was attached to Open Season, which came out on September 29, 2006. On June 8, 2007, [[McDonald's]] issued eight ''Surf's Up'' toys in their [[Happy Meals]] for one month. In the Australian market, a few small [[Stuffed animal|plush]] characters of Cody, Lani, Chicken Joe, and Geek replace some of the toys in the US lineup. There was also a tie-in with the candy [[Air Heads]] which introduces a \"New Wave\" flavor (pineapple) and four collectible [[Lenticular printing|lenticular]] motion surf board shaped pieces. [[Build A Bear]] stores sold plush toys of the film's protagonist, Cody Maverick. Patrons could \"build\" their own Cody as well as dress him up in an array of surf-themed clothing and other accessories in Build A Bear workshops. They could also purchase Cody and accessories at the official site. Several plushes from Nanco intended for claw machines can also be found and purchased in varying sizes (from 6&nbsp;inches to 11&nbsp;inches to 17&nbsp;inches). Characters available: Cody, Lani, Tank, Geek, Big Z, Chicken Joe, and Reggie Belefonte. A rare set of larger (Geek measures 15&nbsp;inches) and higher quality plushes had been made available at the premiere's after party. Won either through available games, or given away with gift sets for attendees. Cody, Lani, Arnold and Geek were created and so far no plans for the dolls to be sold commercially have appeared. A series of children's 100 piece puzzles are available as well depicting various characters and setups. Five inch waterproof plush tub toys released by [[Jakks Pacific]] in minimal quantities to most major retailers. Five characters were produced, including Cody, Tank, Big Z, Arnold, & Chicken Joe. Each character has an attached washcloth/surfboard, but sport questionable likenesses (and in the case of Chicken Joe, entirely off model, bearing more of a resemblance to Mikey). Along with the release of the film, a companion [[Surf's Up (video game)|''Surf's Up'' video game]] was released by [[Ubisoft]] for all the current video gaming systems on the market. All versions of the game are the same with mild graphical differences, with only the [[Nintendo DS]] version changing the overall format.\n\n===Home media===\n''Surf's Up'' was released on high-definition [[Blu-ray Disc]], PSP [[Universal Media Disc|UMD]] Video and [[DVD]] in the [[United States]] on October 9, 2007.
