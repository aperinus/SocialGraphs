It has grossed $66.9&nbsp;million in North America and $145.1 million elsewhere, for a worldwide total of $212 million. The film received largely negative reviews.\n\n==Plot==<!-- Summaries for film must be less than 700 words. -->\n\nIn 1979, the Pope sends a [[priest]] on a mission to protect a newborn baby, Christine York, identified in [[New York City]] by satanists as one chosen to be the mother of [[Satan]]'s [[Antichrist|child]]. However, a few Vatican knights (led by a corrupt [[Cardinal (Catholic Church)|cardinal]]) insist that she must be killed.\n\nIn 1999, Satan [[Spirit possession|possesses]] an investment banker. [[Alcoholism|Alcoholic]] former NYPD detective Jericho Cane, [[Depression (mood)|depressed]] since his wife and daughter's [[contract killing]]s, works for a [[Security company|private security company]] and blames [[God]] for his plight. Jericho and friend Bobby Chicago are assigned to protect the possessed banker. A priest, Thomas Aquinas, fails to kill the banker. Jericho captures Aquinas and, after hearing his ramblings, gives him to the [[New York City Police Department]]. Marge Francis, an NYPD [[detective]] and Jericho's former colleague, tells Jericho that Aquinas has no tongue.\n\nJericho and Bobby investigate Aquinas' apartment, where they find his tongue in a jar and messages and symbols written in blood on the walls. Aquinas turns out to be trained by the Vatican and was sent to New York before disappearing. Jericho questions Father Kovak, a priest who knew Aquinas. Kovak responds in a vague and unsatisfying manner. Satan enters Aquinas' hospital, and [[Crucifixion|crucifies]] him on the ceiling. After he is brought down and presumed dead, Jericho and Chicago read in Latin \"Christ in New York\" carved into his skin. They begin searching for any similar names and come across Christine York in her apartment.\n\nJericho and Chicago rescue her from being killed by the Vatican knights. However, Satan then appears and [[Immolation|immolates]] Chicago. Jericho and Christine flee from him. Marge and another officer, both revealed to be Satanists, demand Jericho surrenders Christine. Jericho kills them both and escapes with Christine. Satan resurrects Marge to rally the other Satanists to do his bidding. Taking refuge in the church, Father Kovak tells Jericho and Christine that Satan must impregnate her by midnight on New Year's Eve to usher in the \"[[Christian eschatology|end of days]]\". Christine accepts Kovak's protection, and Jericho leaves her there.\n\nSatan confronts Jericho in his apartment and tries to tempt him into giving up Christine in exchange for resurrecting his dead family. After Jericho resists his temptations, Chicago arrives at his apartment, and the two agree to retrieve Christine from the church.\n\nBack at the church, Jericho stops the cardinal and his knights from killing Christine. Satan reappears and kills the Vatican clergy. Chicago betrays Jericho, leaving him to be beaten and crucified by a mob of Satanists, revealing that he made a pact with Satan in exchange for his resurrection. After Chicago leaves with Christine, Kovak finds and rescues Jericho. After his recovery, Jericho tracks down Satan to his lair, kills Marge once again and rescues Christine. In the ensuing fight, he convinces Chicago to resist Satan's influence. Satan later kills Chicago for breaking their pact. Jericho destroys the lair, escapes with Christine into a [[Rapid transit|subway]] tunnel and boards a train. Satan follows them, killing the train's driver. Jericho fires another grenade, destroying the train car Satan was in. Satan abandons the banker's irreparably damaged body to pursue Jericho and Christine, leaving him to die.\n\nJericho and Christine arrive at another church, where he renews his faith in God and prays for strength. Satan as a massive, winged creature appears and possesses Jericho. Satan, now in Jericho's body, attempts to [[rape]] Christine. Responding to her pleas, Jericho is able to resist long enough to deliberately impale himself on a nearby sword, sacrificing himself to prevent Satan's endgame. At the stroke of midnight, Satan is sent back to hell. Jericho sees his wife and daughter waiting for him in the [[afterlife]] and dies peacefully. Christine tearfully embraces him as the world celebrates a new millennium.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast list|\n* [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] as Jericho Cane \n* [[Gabriel Byrne]] as The Man\n* [[Robin Tunney]] as Christine York\n* [[Kevin Pollak]] as Bobby Chicago\n* [[CCH Pounder]] as Detective Marge Francis\n* [[Derrick O'Connor]] as Thomas Aquinas\n* [[Miriam Margolyes]] as Mabel\n* [[Udo Kier]] as Head Priest\n* [[Mark Margolis]] as Pope\n* [[Rod Steiger]] as Father Kovak\n* [[Victor Varnado]] as Albino\n* [[Marc Lawrence]] as Old Man\n* [[Denice D.

[[Kate Winslet]] was then set to play the character, but she dropped out and [[Robin Tunney]] replaced her. According to Hyams,\n\n<blockquote>[[James Cameron|Jim Cameron]] was the kind of godfather of me doing that film, because of his relationship with Schwarzenegger. He told me I was doing it! ... ''End Of Days'' was going to be [[Marcus Nispel]], but it wasn't working somehow, but they had Arnold and a start date, and Jim came to me and told me I had to do it. This was the first picture Arnold had made for a couple of years. I think he had a heart thing. So this was Arnold coming back. And he wanted to try to make something good, and to take some chances. I applauded that. And we had very, very good actors around him, like Gabriel Byrne and Kevin Pollak and Rod Steiger. It was a very enjoyable experience. Half way through shooting I told Arnold I thought he should die in this movie. Of course Universal blanched at the idea, so I shot the ending both ways, and everybody agreed that the dying ending was the better one.<ref>[http://www.empireonline.com/features/peter-hyams-film-by-film/p8 \"Peter Hyams Film by Film\" ''Empire''] accessed 30 July 2014</ref></blockquote>\n\nOver 60 visual effects shots were created by [[Rhythm & Hues]].<ref name=\"R&HEffects\">{{cite news|url=https://variety.com/1999/digital/news/vifx-will-do-effects-for-end-of-days-1117491950/|title=   VIFX will do effects for 'End of Days'   |publisher=Variety|access-date=July 1, 2021}}</ref>\n\nAs early as 2016, actress [[Miriam Margolyes]] had complained about Arnold Schwarzenegger's behavior on set.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Heritage |first1=Stuart |title=Something about Miriam Margolyes v Arnold Schwarzenegger smells funny |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jul/20/miriam-margolyess-arnold-schwarzenegger-fart-feud |website=The Guardian |date=20 July 2022 |access-date=20 July 2022}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Hemelryk |first1=Simon |title=Miriam Margolyes: \"I Remember...\" |url=https://www.readersdigest.co.uk/culture/celebrities/miriam-margolyes-i-remember |website=Reader's Digest |publisher=Reader's Digest |access-date=20 July 2022}}</ref> In 2022, Margolyes' reports caught wind again when she accused Arnold Schwarzenegger of deliberately farting in her face while on set.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Bucklow |first1=Andrew |title=One-on-one with Miriam Margolyes |url=https://podcasts.apple.com/au/podcast/one-on-one-with-miriam-margolyes/id1593788055?i=1000570194295 |website=I've Got News For You |publisher=news.com.au |access-date=20 July 2022}}</ref> Schwarzenegger has yet to respond to the allegations.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Sharf |first=Zack |date=2022-07-19 |title='Harry Potter' Actor Says 'Rude' Arnold Schwarzenegger Farted in Her Face on Set: 'He Did It Deliberately |url=https://variety.com/2022/film/news/arnold-schwarzenegger-farted-miriam-margolyes-1235319845/ |access-date=2022-07-20 |website=Variety |language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title='Harry Potter' Actor Says 'Rude' Arnold Schwarzenegger Farted in Her Face on Set: 'He Did It Deliberately |url=https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/harry-potter-actor-says-rude-205221849.html |access-date=2022-07-20 |website=www.yahoo.com |language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |date=July 18, 2022 |first=Glenn |last=Garner |title=Miriam Margolyes Says Arnold Schwarzenegger 'Farted in My Face' While Filming End of Days |url=https://people.com/movies/miriam-margolyes-says-arnold-schwarzenegger-farted-my-face-while-filming-end-of-days/ |access-date=2022-07-20 |website=PEOPLE.com |language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Music==\n===Soundtrack===\n{{Main|End of Days (soundtrack)}}\n\nThe film's soundtrack primarily contains tracks by [[industrial rock]] and [[alternative metal]] bands.
