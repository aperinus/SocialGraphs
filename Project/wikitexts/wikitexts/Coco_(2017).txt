Current wordcount is 679 so PLEASE DO NOT ADD TO THIS SUMMARY WITHOUT CHECKING WORDCOUNT FIRST. -->\nIn Santa Cecilia, Mexico, a young woman named Imelda marries a man who eventually leaves her and her daughter Coco to pursue a music career. When he never returns, Imelda banishes music from her family forever and starts a shoemaking business.\n\nYears later, Imelda's great-great-grandson, Miguel, now lives with the elderly Coco and their family, including Miguel's parents and his grandmother, who are also shoemakers. Despite his family's music ban, Miguel secretly idolizes the deceased musician Ernesto de la Cruz, and teaches himself to play guitar by watching Ernesto's old films. On the [[Dia de los Muertos|Day of the Dead]], Miguel inadvertently bumps into the family {{lang|es|[[ofrenda]]}}, breaking a frame containing a photo of Imelda and an infant Coco. He discovers a hidden section of the photograph shows his great-great-grandfather, whose head has been torn from the photo, holding Ernesto's famous guitar. Believing this proves Ernesto is his relative, Miguel announces to his family that he will become a musician. \n\nAfter Miguel's grandmother destroys his guitar, Miguel breaks into Ernesto's mausoleum and takes Ernesto's guitar to use in a local talent competition. Once Miguel strums it, he becomes invisible to all living people. However, he can interact with his [[calaca|skeletal]] dead relatives, who are visiting from the Land of the Dead for the holiday. Taking him back with them, they learn that Imelda cannot visit, since Miguel inadvertently removed her photo from the {{lang|es|ofrenda}}. Miguel also discovers that stealing Ernesto's guitar caused him to be cursed; he must have a family blessing to return to the Land of the Living before sunrise, or he will die. Imelda offers him a blessing on the condition he abandons music, but Miguel decides to seek Ernesto's blessing instead. He encounters a homeless skeleton named H\u00e9ctor, who offers to help Miguel get to Ernesto, provided Miguel takes H\u00e9ctor's photo to the Land of the Living and puts it on an {{lang|es|ofrenda}}. Otherwise, H\u00e9ctor will never get to visit his daughter, and will eventually disappear as one of the forgotten. H\u00e9ctor helps Miguel enter a talent competition to win entry to Ernesto's mansion, but Miguel's family tracks him down, forcing him to flee again.\n\nMiguel sneaks into the mansion, where a surprised Ernesto welcomes him as his descendant. H\u00e9ctor arrives, again imploring Miguel to put up his photo. Ernesto and H\u00e9ctor, who once performed together, begin to argue; Miguel learns that, when H\u00e9ctor wanted to break up the act and return home, Ernesto, who could not write songs himself, poisoned H\u00e9ctor and stole his guitar and songs, passing them off as his own. To protect his legacy, Ernesto seizes H\u00e9ctor's photo, and has Miguel and H\u00e9ctor thrown into a [[cenote]] pit. There, Miguel discovers that Coco's father, and Imelda's lost husband, is H\u00e9ctor, not Ernesto.\n\nRescued by Imelda and the family, Miguel reveals the truth about H\u00e9ctor's death. Imelda and H\u00e9ctor reconcile, and the family infiltrates Ernesto's concert to retrieve H\u00e9ctor's photo. Ernesto's crimes are exposed to the audience, and Imelda's [[alebrije]] Pepita attacks Ernesto, causing a giant bell to fall on him. In the chaos, H\u00e9ctor's photograph is lost. As the sun rises, Coco's memory of H\u00e9ctor fades; Imelda and a fading H\u00e9ctor quickly bless Miguel, who returns home. \n\nAfter Miguel plays \"[[Remember Me (Pixar song)|Remember Me]]\" on H\u00e9ctor's guitar, Coco brightens and sings along with him. She reveals that she had saved the torn-off piece of the family photo with H\u00e9ctor's face on it, then tells her family stories about her father, thus saving his memory as well as his existence in the Land of the Dead. Miguel's family reconciles with him, ending the ban on music.\n\nOne year later, Coco's collected letters from H\u00e9ctor prove that Ernesto stole his songs, allowing H\u00e9ctor to be rightfully honored in Ernesto's place. Miguel shows the family {{lang|es|ofrenda}} to his new baby sister Socorro; the ''ofrenda'' now contains H\u00e9ctor and a recently-deceased Coco.<ref>{{Cite web|last1=Unkrich|first1=Lee|author-link=Lee Unkrich|last2=Katx|first2=Jason|author-link2=Jason Katz|last3=Aldrich|first3=Matthew|last4=Molina|first4=Adrian|author-link4=Adrian Molina|title=Coco Screenplay|url=https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/screenplays-pdf/Movie-Screenplay-PDFs/Coco_Script.pdf|access-date=2021-03-25|publisher=[[Disney]]|via=No Film School}}{{Rp|128}}</ref> In the Land of the Dead, H\u00e9ctor and Imelda rekindle their romance, joining Coco and the rest of their family for a visit to the living.

Color was one: \"Given the holiday and the iconography, [Pixar] knew the Land of the Dead had to be a visually vibrant and colorful place, so [they] deliberately designed Santa Cecilia to be more muted\" said Unkrich.<ref name=\"PressKit\"/>\n\nAccording to Harley Jessup, the film's production designer, Santa Cecilia is based on real Mexican villages, as the production team \"stayed grounded in reality in the Land of the Living\". Chris Bernardi, the film's set supervisor, said that the town was made small so Miguel could feel confined. Bert Berry, the film's art director, said that aged building materials were used to depict Santa Cecilia \"as an older charming city\".<ref name=\"PressKit\"/> According to Unkrich, Miguel's guitar playing is authentic, as they \"videotaped musicians playing each song or melody and strapped GoPros on their guitars\" to use as a reference. For the scene in which Miguel plays music in his secret hideout, the filmmakers used \"very elegant, lyrical camera moves\" and \"gentle drifts and slow arcing moves around Miguel as he plays his guitar with very shallow depth of field to enhance the beauty of the soft-focus foreground candles\".<ref name=\"PressKit\"/>\n\nChristian Hoffman, the film's character supervisor, said that all of the details in Mama Coco's face were not modeled. Instead, his team used special software to design separate layers of detail, which were then added to her face with a shader. The character's model was made with higher resolution to get all the wrinkles right, according to Hoffman.<ref name=\"PressKit\"/> Pixar used some Xolo dogs to use as reference for the character Dante, while a tentacle from ''[[Finding Dory]]'''s Hank was used for his tongue.\n\nJessup called the Marigold petal bridge that connects both worlds \"elegant and magical\". Michael K. O'Brien, the film's effects supervisor, called it \"a huge technical challenge\" for the animation team, but referred to it as something \"so visually exciting with petals dripping from it; it was a massive artistic undertaking. [the production team] wanted it to glow \u2014 to feel alive\". The scenes in which Miguel takes a few petals off of the bridge and in which Hector sinks into the bridge were given more effects and special art direction.<ref name=\"PressKit\"/>\n\nFor the Land of the Dead, Unkrich did not want \"to have just a free-for-all, wacky world\", wanting instead to add logic and be \"ever-expanding because new residents would arrive regularly\". Jessup said that the animation team wanted the Land of the Dead \"to be a vibrant explosion of color\" when Miguel arrives. Jessup also said that \"Lee [Unkrich] described a vertical world of towers, contrasting with the flatness of Santa Cecilia. The lights and reflections are dazzling and there's a crazy transportation system that connects it all. The costume colors are much more vibrant than in the Land of the Living, where [the animation team] tried to stay grounded in reality. [They] really went all out in the Land of the Dead to make it a reflection of the holiday\". According to David Ryu, the film's supervising technical director, the animation team \"figured out a way to introduce a single light \u2014 but give it a million points\" for the scenes on the outside in the Land of the Dead: \"The renderer sees it as one light, but we see a million lights\".<ref name=\"PressKit\"/>\n\nAccording to art director Daniel Arraiga, the animators \"had to figure out how to give [the skeletons] personality without skin, muscles, noses or even lips\" and that they \"played with shapes and did a lot of paintings. [They] sculpted and studied skulls from every angle to figure out where [they] could add appeal and charm\". Global technology supervisor J.D. Northrup was hired early in the film's production in order to avoid potential issues in the film's animation process. Northrup said that \"Each [of the skeletons' pieces] had to be independent so the complexity of the rig and the stress that it puts on the pipeline were something like we've never seen before.\" Northrup was also tasked with simplifying the skeleton's elements to render the skeleton crowds. In order to create the skeletons, several additional controls were used, as they \"needed to move in ways that humans don't,\" according to character modeling and articulation lead Michael Honse. Honse said that the bones were a particular problem, stating that \"there was a lot of back-and-forth with animation to get it right,\" but found \"really cool ways\" to move the skeletons.<ref name=\"PressKit\"/>\n\n===Music and soundtrack===\n{{Main|Coco (soundtrack)}}\n\n==Marketing and release==\nThe first teaser of ''Coco'' was released on March 15, 2017.<ref name=\"F\">{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/scottmendelson/2017/03/15/pixars-coco-is-trapped-between-justice-league-and-star-wars/ |title=Pixar's 'Coco' Is Trapped Between 'Justice League' And 'Star Wars' |first=Scott|last=Mendelson |work=[[Forbes (magazine)|Forbes]] |date=March 15, 2017 |access-date=March 15, 2017 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170315171554/https://www.forbes.com/sites/scottmendelson/2017/03/15/pixars-coco-is-trapped-between-justice-league-and-star-wars/ |archive-date=March 15, 2017 }}</ref> The teaser trailer introduced the basic concept of the film, while highlighting its focus on music.<ref name=\"SF\">{{cite web|url=https://www.slashfilm.com/coco-trailer/ |title='Coco' Trailer: Pixar's Next Original Movie Reveals Its First Footage |first=Jacob|last=Hall |publisher=[[/Film]] |date=March 15, 2017 |access-date=March 15, 2017 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170315161314/http://www.slashfilm.com/coco-trailer/ |archive-date=March 15, 2017 }}</ref> Scott Mendelson of ''[[Forbes]]'' praised the trailer as \"a terrific old-school Pixar sell, mostly consisting of a single sequence and offering just the barest hint of what's to come.\"<ref name=\"F\"/> The film's themes and imagery drew comparison to another animated film that centered around D\u00eda de Muertos, ''[[The Book of Life (2014 film)|The Book of Life]]'' (2014).<ref name=\"SF\"/><ref name=\"EP\">{{cite web|url=https://www.empireonline.com/people/gael-garcia-bernal/first-teaser-trailer-pixar-coco/ |title=First Teaser Trailer For Pixar's Coco |first=James|last=White |work=[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]] |date=March 15, 2017 |access-date=March 15, 2017 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170315173627/http://www.empireonline.com/people/gael-garcia-bernal/first-teaser-trailer-pixar-coco/ |archive-date=March 15, 2017 }}</ref> A two-minute short film, titled ''Dante's Lunch \u2013 A Short Tail'', was released online on March 29, 2017.
