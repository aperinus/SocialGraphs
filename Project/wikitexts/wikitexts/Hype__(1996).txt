([[1996 in film|1996]]) is a documentary directed by [[Doug Pray]] about the popularity of [[grunge]] rock in the early to mid-1990s United States.  It incorporates interviews and rare concert footage to trace the development of the grunge scene from its early beginning in neighborhood basements to its emergence as an explosive [[popular culture|pop culture]] phenomenon.  ''Hype!'' attempts to dispel some of the myths of the genre promulgated by [[media hype]] by depicting the grunge subculture from the point of view of people who were active in the scene. The film generally portrays this [[mythos]] in a satirical way while acknowledging that it was media hype that helped propel some of these obscure bands to fame.\n\n==Release==\nThe film premiered at the [[Sundance Film Festival]] in January 1996.
