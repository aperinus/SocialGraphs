Smith-Cameron]] and [[Amy Irving]]. The film is a sequel to the 1976 horror film ''[[Carrie (1976 film)|Carrie]]'' based on the 1974 [[Carrie (novel)|novel of the same name]] by [[Stephen King]], and serves as the second film in the [[Adaptations of Carrie|''Carrie'' franchise]]. Its plot follows the younger half-sister of [[Carrie White]] (Bergl), also suffering with [[psychokinesis|telekinesis]], who finds that her best friend's suicide was spurred by a group of popular male classmates who exploited her for sexual gain.\n\n''The Rage: Carrie 2'' was released on March 12, 1999, and was a [[box office bomb]] at the time of release, grossing $17 million against a $21 million production budget. It received generally negative reviews from critics, who criticized the film's failure to capture the essence of what made the original \"believably\" creepy. In spite of this, the performances of the cast were praised\u2014especially that of Bergl, who was nominated for a [[Saturn Awards|Saturn Award]]\u2014and it has obtained a [[cult following]].\n\n== Plot ==\nIn 1986, as a child, Rachel Lang is placed in [[foster care]] when her mother, Barbara, is diagnosed with schizophrenia after mistaking signs of Rachel's [[psychokinesis|telekinesis]] by demonic possession. Thirteen years later in September 1999, Rachel, an outcast, is living with unsympathetic foster parents and attending high school. After her best friend, Lisa Parker, commits suicide by leaping from the roof of the school, it is uncovered that Eric Stark, a popular football star, rejected her after exploiting her for sex.\n\nA devastated Rachel finds a photo of Lisa and Eric kissing while developing rolls of Lisa's film at a photo lab where she works. Rachel turns the photograph in to police, and explains that Lisa had confessed to her that she had recently lost her virginity. Sheriff Kelton, along with the school's guidance counselor, [[Sue Snell]], pursue statutory rape charges against Eric, who is over eighteen. It is uncovered that Eric and his football player peers, including Mark Bing and Chuck Potter, are competing to see who could seduce the most girls by the end of the year.\n\nLate one night while driving home, Jesse Ryan, another player on the football team, is flagged down by Rachel after her [[Basset Hound]], Walter, is hit by a car on the road. Jesse, who is not as callous as his peers, takes a genuine interest in Rachel, at the behest of cheerleader Tracy Campbell, who is pursuing him. Meanwhile, having discovered that Rachel implicated them in Lisa's death, Eric and Mark attempt to scare her into silence by harassing her at her home, but her unusually strong telekinetic powers frighten them away.\n\nMeanwhile, Sue gradually begins to suspect Rachel may possess telekinetic powers through their counseling sessions. She tracks down Rachel's institutionalized mother, Barbara, whose schizophrenia has stabilized, and Barbara confesses that Rachel's father was Ralph White, the father of [[Carrie White]]. Sue subsequently brings Rachel to the ruins of the former high school that she attended, which Carrie destroyed in a telekinetic rage in 1976 after [[Carrie (1976 film)|being humiliated at her senior prom]]. Sue, a peer of Carrie's, was one of the few survivors of the incident. When Sue discloses that Carrie is Rachel's half-sister, Rachel dismisses her as a liar.\n\nLater, the [[district attorney]] covers up the statutory rape charges against Eric because the players' families have political influence. Mark retaliates against Rachel by setting up a romantic getaway for her and Jesse, which he covertly films unbeknownst to them. Monica Jones, the girlfriend of Mark's friend Brad Winters, then befriends Rachel under false pretenses, inviting her to a party after a football game. Rachel leaves with Monica to the party, while Jesse is forced to ride with Tracy after his car's tires are slashed. Tracy stops at her house first and unsuccessfully attempts to seduce him. Meanwhile, Sue manages to sneak Barbara out of the institution so that she can confess Rachel's father's identity to her.\n\nAt the party, Mark and Chuck soon confront Rachel, revealing their sex game and falsely claiming that Rachel was added to Jesse's list of girls he has bedded. They also project the footage of her and Jesse having sex for all of the partygoers to see. This triggers Rachel's telekinesis, and she seals the house closed. She kills most of the partygoers by causing a large glass window to explode, slashing them to death, and also triggers a fire. Meanwhile, Sue and Barbara track Rachel to the party, but a fire-poker impales the front door, killing Sue. As Rachel pursues Monica, Eric, and Mark through the house, they arm themselves with weapons. Rachel kills Monica by causing her glasses to implode into her eyes, causing Monica to inadvertently [[castration|castrate]] Eric with a [[harpoon]]. Mark shoots her with a flare gun and Rachel falls into the swimming pool. When Mark goes over to inspect whether she is dead, Rachel appears out of the water and pulls Mark into the pool. Rachel triggers the sensor to the automatic pool cover, and manages to free herself while Mark drowns.\n\nBarbara confronts an injured Rachel and initially attempts to comfort her, but proceeds to accuse her of being possessed, and flees. Jesse and Tracy arrive moments later, and Rachel kills Tracy by causing a piece of ceiling to collapse on her. On a balcony, Rachel confronts Jesse about his supposed list, but he denies it. Rachel then notices that the videotape of her and Jesse, still playing in the living room, captured Jesse saying \"I love you\" while she slept, and immediately realizes that Jesse's feelings for her are indeed genuine. Moments later, an awning collapses on Rachel, and with Jesse unable to free her, she uses her telekinesis to throw him over the balcony onto the pool cover as she burns to death.\n\nOne year later in 2000, Jesse, now studying at King's University, shares a dormitory with Rachel's dog Walter. He has a vision of Rachel appearing in his room, and they kiss before she shatters into pieces. He panickedly awakens, realizing the vision was only a nightmare.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{div col|colwidth=25em}}\n* [[Emily Bergl]] as Rachel Lang\n** Kayla Campbell as Young Rachel\n* [[Jason London]] as Jesse Ryan: a popular [[Jock (athlete)|jock]] with whom Rachel falls in love.\n* [[Dylan Bruno]] as Mark Bing: a football player who owns the mansion where the football game after-party takes place.\n* [[J.

The film eventually went into production in 1998 under the title ''Carrie 2: Say You're Sorry''. A few weeks into production, director [[Robert Mandel]] quit over creative differences and Katt Shea hurriedly took over the reins with less than a week to prepare to start filming, and two weeks' worth of footage to reshoot.<ref name=\"commentary\">''\"The Rage: Carrie 2\" audio commentary''.

On [[Metacritic]] it had a rating of 42 on a scale from 0\u2013100 based on 21 reviews indicating mixed or average reviews.\n\n[[Roger Ebert]] gave the film two out of four stars: \"The original ''Carrie'' worked because it was a skillful teenage drama grafted onto a horror ending.
