The screenplay, written by [[Dan O'Bannon]] with a rewrite by Miguel Tejada-Flores, is based on [[Philip K. Dick]]'s 1953 short story \"[[Second Variety]]\",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bloody-disgusting.com/news/18649|title=Ring in the New Year with 10 Futuristic Horror Films}}</ref> and addresses themes commonly found in that author's work: societal conflict, confusion of reality and illusion, and machines turning upon their creators. The film received generally negative response from critics at the time of its release, although it has since gained a cult following.  A sequel ''[[Screamers: The Hunting]]'', was released in 2009, to mixed reviews.\n\n==Plot==\n<!--per [[WP:FILMPLOT]], plot summaries should be between 400 and 700 words-->\nIn the year 2078, the planet Sirius 6B, once a thriving mining hub, has been reduced to a toxic wasteland by a war between the mining company, known as the New Economic Block (N.E.B.), and \"The Alliance\", a group of former mining and science personnel. After miners discovered that their extraction of ore released toxic gases, they went on [[Strike action|strike]], and the mining company hired [[mercenaries]] as [[strike breakers]]. Five years into the war, Alliance scientists created and deployed Autonomous Mobile Swords (AMS) \u2014 [[Artificial intelligence|artificially intelligent]] [[self-replicating machine]]s that hunt down and kill N.E.B. soldiers on their own.  They are nicknamed \"screamers\" because of a high-pitched noise they emit as they attack.  Screamers track targets by their heartbeats, so Alliance soldiers wear \"tabs\" which broadcast a signal canceling out the wearer's heartbeat and rendering them \"invisible\" to the machines.\n\nA fragile stalemate is in effect between the two exhausted, poorly supplied, and undermanned armies.  The Alliance recovers a message from a dead N.E.B. soldier, killed by screamers as he approached the Alliance compound, guaranteeing safe passage through N.E.B. territory to discuss a truce.  When Alliance commanding officer Joe Hendricksson reports this development to his Earth-based superiors, he is told that peace negotiations are already underway on Earth; but Private \"Ace\" Jefferson, newly arrived from Earth, says that is untrue.  Hendricksson is not surprised; he has long suspected that both sides have simply written off Sirius 6B and abandoned their armies.\n\nHendricksson decides that the only realistic chance of survival for himself and his soldiers is to accept the N.E.B. truce offer.  He sets out for a meeting with the N.E.B. commander, accompanied by Jefferson. While traveling through a destroyed city they come upon a war orphan, a young boy named David, clutching a teddy bear.  Unwilling to abandon a defenseless civilian, they bring the boy along.  The following night they are attacked by a reptilian screamer that they have never before encountered.  Hendricksson is alarmed that their Alliance tabs did not protect them.\n\nAs the group nears the N.E.B. compound, two enemy soldiers, Becker and Ross, open fire on David, whose chest explodes in a shower of gears, bolts, and wires.  They explain to the astonished Alliance men that David was a new \"type 3\" screamer impersonating a human.  Most of the N.E.B. contingent has been wiped out by another \"David\" screamer that a patrol unwittingly brought into the base; Becker, Ross, and a black marketeer named Jessica are the only survivors.\n\nThe group heads to the N.E.B. command center but finds only an empty building and large pools of blood. Locating the mainframe computer, Hendricksson learns that the N.E.B. truce offer was just as false as the Alliance message from Earth. The group retreats to the N.E.B. bunker, pursued by \"Davids\".  The discovery that the screamers have \"evolved\" new versions on their own that are  indistinguishable from humans, and immune to Alliance tabs, leads to paranoia and distrust.  Becker becomes convinced that Ross is a screamer and kills him, only to discover that he was human.  The four survivors retreat to the Alliance base, only to find that the \"Davids\" have gained entrance to that compound as well, with equally devastating results.  As dozens of \"Davids\" pour out of the bunker's entrance, Hendricksson fires a micro-nuclear missile into the bunker.  Jefferson rushes to the aid of Becker, who was apparently injured in the blast, but Becker's cries of distress are a ruse; he is a \"type 2\" screamer, and he kills Jefferson. After Hendricksson destroys Becker, only he and Jessica remain.\n\nNow paranoid, Hendricksson worries that Jessica could be a screamer as well.  He slashes her hand, and is relieved to see blood dripping from the wound. They locate an emergency escape shuttle.  As they prepare it for launch, they are attacked by another \"Becker\" that Hendricksson destroys. With the shuttle now prepared, they discover it can carry only one person. Hendricksson offers the shuttle to Jessica; but a second \"Jessica\" arrives, confirming that she is a screamer after all, and even more human-like.  Hendricksson resigns himself to death; but to his surprise, Jessica shields him, then sacrifices herself in battle with her lookalike.  With her last breath, Jessica confesses her love for Hendricksson.\n\nHendricksson departs for Earth on the escape shuttle with a single souvenir, the teddy bear carried by the original \"David\".  As the screen fades to black, the bear slowly begins to move on its own.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Peter Weller]] as Commander Joseph A.

Screenwriter Dan O'Bannon had completed his adaptation of Dick's short story ''[[Second Variety]]'' in 1981 (along with his adaptation of another of Dick's short stories, ''[[We Can Remember It For You Wholesale]]'', which became the 1990 film ''[[Total Recall (1990 film)|Total Recall]]'').<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Spelling|first=Ian|date=July 1996|title=Screaming Reversals|url=https://archive.org/details/starlog_magazine-228|journal=[[Starlog]]|issue=228|pages=[https://archive.org/details/starlog_magazine-228/page/n117 118]\u2013121|via=[[Internet Archive]]}}</ref> By 1983, O'Bannon's screenplay for ''Screamers'' had been optioned by Tom Naud (SFX designer on the 1981 film ''[[Outland (film)|Outland]]'').<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Goldberg|first=Lee|date=June 1983|title=Dan O'Bannon: My Son, The Hitman|url=https://archive.org/details/starlog_magazine-071|journal=[[Starlog]]|issue=71|pages=[https://archive.org/details/starlog_magazine-071/page/n27 26]\u201328, 66|via=[[Internet Archive]]}}</ref> However, the production never went ahead as planned.

Hendricksson died when he deliberately allowed his escape shuttle to burn up in the atmosphere during [[Atmospheric reentry|reentry]] to Earth. The official determination is that he committed suicide due to [[post-traumatic stress]]; but it is strongly implied that he actually did it to prevent the \"teddy bear\" screamer on board from reaching Earth.  Meanwhile, an SOS signal arrives from Sirius 6B.  A contingent of seven soldiers, including Hendricksson's daughter Victoria Bronte (Holden), is dispatched to the war torn mining planet to investigate.  The film features all of the screamers from the original film, as well as a sleeker, longer, and more serpentine screamer with cutting mandibles for a mouth.\n\nAs with ''Screamers'', critical reaction to ''Screamers: The Hunting'' was mixed. David Johnson of ''DVD Verdict'' wrote that \"the visual effects were surprisingly effective\" and \"[p]ractical effects impress as well\", but added, \"Unfortunately ... the script defaults to a clich\u00e9d finale, and a predictable\u2014though well-executed\u2014final twist ending.\"  He concluded, \"I had a pretty decent time with [''Screamers: The Hunting''] ...
