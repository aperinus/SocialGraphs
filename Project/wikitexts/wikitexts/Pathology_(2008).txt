The film premiered April 11, 2008 in the United Kingdom and opened in [[limited release]] in the [[United States]] on April 18, 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0964539/releaseinfo |title=Pathology (2008) - Release dates |access-date=2008-04-23 |publisher=[[Internet Movie Database]]}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nThe intro shows a camera recording faces of corpses, with their mouths being moved by medical residents.\n\nDr. Teddy Grey graduates at the top of his class from [[Harvard Medical School]] and joins one of the nation's most prestigious [[pathology]] [[Residency (medicine)|residency]] programs. There, a rivalry develops between a group of interns and Teddy. They invite him into their group, which entertains itself with a secret after-hours game at the morgue of who can commit the perfect undetectable murder. Eventually the group's leader, Jake Gallo, realizes that Teddy is sleeping with his girlfriend, Juliette Bath. When Teddy catches several members of the group in lies, he realizes that what initially seemed like vigilante killings are, in reality, innocent people murdered for sport.\n\nTeddy's fianc\u00e9e Gwen arrives to stay with him in his apartment. Gallo, angered by Juliette's infidelity, kills her for the next game. However, just as they are about to begin the autopsy on Juliette (in the meantime plotting Teddy's death), Gallo realizes that the gas has been left on in the room.  Teddy rigged the gas to kill everyone in the group.  This results in a massive explosion as one of the group lights a crystal-meth pipe.  Everyone in the room is caught in the explosion.  Gallo realizes what is about to happen and survives. Teddy is seen walking away from the explosion.\n\nLater, Gallo manages to kill Gwen in what he believes to be the \"perfect murder\". Upon completing his autopsy report on his murdered fianc\u00e9e, Teddy is knocked out by Gallo and then is forced to trade verbal barbs with him. Teddy uses some of Gallo's own rhetoric against him in reverse psychology fashion, after which fellow pathologist Ben Stravinsky frees Teddy and together they kill Gallo in exactly the same way that he killed Teddy's fianc\u00e9e. In the process, they vivisect Gallo.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Milo Ventimiglia]] as Dr. Ted Grey\n*[[Michael Weston]] as Dr. Jake Gallo\n*[[Alyssa Milano]] as Gwen Williamson\n*[[Lauren Lee Smith]] as Dr. Juliette Bath\n*[[Johnny Whitworth]] as Dr. Griffin Cavanaugh\n*[[John de Lancie]] as Dr. Quentin Morris\n*[[Mei Melan\u00e7on]] as Dr. Catherine Ivy\n*[[Keir O'Donnell]] as Dr. Ben Stravinsky\n*[[Dan Callahan]] as Dr. Chip Bentwood\n*[[Larry Drake]] as Fat Bastard\n*[[Buddy Lewis (comedian)|Buddy Lewis]] as Harper Johnson\n*[[Alan Blumenfeld]] as Mr. Williamson\n*Deborah Pollack as Mrs. Williamson\n\n==Critical reception==\n{{expand section|date=November 2016}}\nThe film received mixed reviews from critics.
