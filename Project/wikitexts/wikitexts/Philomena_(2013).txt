It was also nominated for four [[British Academy Film Awards|BAFTA Awards]] and three [[Golden Globe Award]]s.\n\n==Plot==\nLondon-based journalist [[Martin Sixsmith]] has lost his job as a government adviser. He is approached at a party by the daughter of [[Philomena Lee]]. She suggests that he write a story about her mother, who was forced to give up her toddler son Anthony nearly fifty years ago. Though Sixsmith is initially reluctant to write a human interest story, he meets Philomena and decides to investigate her case.\n\nIn 1951, Philomena became pregnant after having sex with a man she did not know at a county fair, and was sent by her father to [[Sean Ross Abbey]] in [[Roscrea]] in Ireland. After giving birth, she was forced to work in the [[Magdalene asylum|convent laundry]] for four years, with little contact with her son. The nuns gave her son up for adoption without giving Philomena a chance to say goodbye. She kept her lost son a secret from her family for nearly fifty years.\n\nMartin and Philomena begin their search at the convent. The nuns claim that the adoption records were destroyed in a fire years earlier; they did not, however, lose the contract she was forced to sign decades ago forbidding her from contacting her son, which Martin considers suspicious. At a pub, the locals tell Martin that the convent burnt the records deliberately, and that most of the children were sold for \u00a31,000 each to wealthy Americans.\n\nMartin's investigation reaches a dead end in Ireland, but he receives a promising lead from the United States and invites Philomena to accompany him there. His contacts help him discover that Anthony was renamed [[Michael A. Hess]], who became a lawyer and senior official in the [[Presidency of Ronald Reagan|Reagan]] and [[Presidency of George H. W. Bush|George H. W. Bush]] administrations. When Philomena notices Martin in the background of a photo of Michael, he remembers that he met him years earlier while working in the US. They also learn that he has been dead for eight years.\n\nPhilomena decides she wants to meet people who knew Michael and learn more about him from them. They visit a former colleague of Michael's and discover that Michael was gay and died of [[HIV/AIDS|AIDS]]. They also visit his sister Mary, who was adopted at the same time from the convent, and learn that they were both [[Psychological abuse|emotionally]] and [[physical abuse|physically abused]] by their adoptive parents, and hear about his partner Pete Olsson.\n\nAfter avoiding Martin's attempts to contact him, Pete agrees to talk to Philomena. He shows Philomena some videos of his life with Michael. To Martin and Philomena's surprise, they see footage of Michael, dated shortly before he died, at the Abbey where he was adopted, and Pete explains that, although he never told his family, Michael had privately wondered about his birth mother all his life, and had returned to Ireland in his final months to try to find her. Pete informs them that the nuns had told Michael that his mother had abandoned him and that they had lost contact with her. He also reveals that, against his parents' wishes, he had Michael buried in the convent's cemetery.\n\nPhilomena and Martin go to the convent to ask them where Michael's grave is. Despite Philomena's pleas, Martin angrily breaks into the private quarters and argues with an elderly nun, Sister Hildegarde McNulty, who worked at the convent when Anthony was forcibly adopted. He accuses her of lying to Anthony and denying him the chance to finally reunite with Philomena, purely out of self-righteousness. Hildegarde is unrepentant, saying that losing her son was Philomena's penance for having sex out of wedlock.\n\nMartin demands an apology, telling her that what she did was un-Christian, but is speechless when Philomena instead chooses to forgive her of her own volition. Philomena then asks to see her son's grave, where Martin tells her he has chosen not to publish the story. Philomena tells him to publish it anyway.\n\n==Cast==\n<!--Cast as billed in film with roles from Credits-->\n<!--Billed actors-->\n<!--Pre-title actors-->\n* [[Judi Dench]] as [[Philomena Lee]]\n* [[Steve Coogan]] as [[Martin Sixsmith]]\n<!--Post-title billed actors-->\n* [[Michelle Fairley]] as Sally Mitchell\n* [[Barbara Jefford]] as Sister Hildegarde\n* [[Anna Maxwell Martin]] as Jane\n* [[Mare Winningham]] as Mary\n\n<!--non-billed notable actors with citations-->\nIn addition to the main cast, [[Sophie Kennedy Clark]] plays a young Philomena,<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Guiducci |first=Mark |date=22 November 2013 |title=10 Minutes with Philomena's Sophie Kennedy Clark |magazine=[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]] |url=http://www.vogue.com/culture/article/10-minutes-with-philomenas-sophie-kennedy-clark/#1 |access-date=12 August 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140812210107/http://www.vogue.com/culture/article/10-minutes-with-philomenas-sophie-kennedy-clark/#1 |archive-date=12 August 2014}}</ref> [[Kate Fleetwood]] plays a young Sister Hildegarde, [[Simone Lahbib]] plays Kate Sixsmith, [[Cathy Belton]] plays Sister Claire, [[Charlie Murphy (actress)|Charlie Murphy]] plays Kathleen, [[Amy McAllister]] plays Sister Anunciata, [[Sean Mahon]] plays [[Michael A.
