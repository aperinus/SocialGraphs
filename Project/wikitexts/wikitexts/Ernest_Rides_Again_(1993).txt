Cherry III|John Cherry]] and starring [[Jim Varney]]. The sixth film to feature the character [[Ernest P. Worrell]], the fifth in the ''Ernest'' series and the final to be released theatrically. The plot follows Ernest and a history professor as they discover a long-lost [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]] cannon and must protect it from others who want the precious jewels hidden inside.\n\n==Plot synopsis==\n\nLovable know-it-all knucklehead [[Ernest P. Worrell]], who is working as a [[janitor]] at a local college, discovers an antique metal plate near a construction site. Ernest shows it to Dr. Melon, a university professor who believes that it came from a giant [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]] [[cannon]] called \"Goliath\" (named after the [[Goliath|legendary biblical giant]]). Dr. Melon had previously been ridiculed by his peers for theorizing that the real [[Crown Jewels of England]] were stolen during the Revolutionary War and were actually hidden inside the long-lost cannon.\n\nThey begin to search for the artifact near the construction site and eventually locate it inside an abandoned mine. They are ambushed by historical antiquity collector and Dr. Melon's colleague Dr. Glencliff whom they then lead on a harrowing chase through the countryside. Things become more complicated for them when British authorities hear about the incident and send a team of secret agents after them to retrieve the jewels. Dr. Melon's wife, Nan, on the other hand is only after him and Ernest for the jewels. While everyone is hot on their trail, Ernest develops a deep friendship with Dr. Melon. After crashing the cannon into a forest, Ernest locates the [[jewels]], not in its barrel as the legend describes but in the [[gunpowder]] [[kegs]]. After putting the [[crown (headgear)|crown]] on his head, he finds himself unable to get it off. Dr. Glencliff shows up, abducts him, and takes him to his [[clinic]] in an attempt to surgically remove it and kill him at the same time. Dr. Melon meets up with Nan and convinces her that Ernest changed his life.\n\nWhile at the clinic, Ernest manages to escape from the surgery room and lead Dr. Glencliff on a chase through the building. When he has nowhere else to hide, he and Dr. Glencliff have one last fight to get the crown before Dr. Melon arrives. At the last minute, Dr. Glencliff takes an axe off of the wall and attempts to behead Ernest. Just as he is moments away from death, Dr. Melon bursts through the door and hits Dr. Glencliff over the head with the same antique metal plate Ernest found, knocking him out. Ernest realizes that Dr. Melon has saved his life and they both realize that they have gone from being acquaintances to friends. At the same time, British authorities arrive and explain to Ernest that the crown must be taken back to its rightful home. He explains that it will not come off his head and the authorities declare that whoever wears it is King of England. Dr. Melon removes it for him by tricking him about what is on his shirt, flicking him in the face. It causes it to fall off his head.\n\n==Cast==\n\n* [[Jim Varney]] as [[Ernest P.
