Bloom and [[Jonathan Roberts (writer)|Jonathan Roberts]] and directed by [[Rob Reiner]]. The film stars [[John Cusack]], [[Daphne Zuniga]], [[Viveca Lindfors]], and [[Nicollette Sheridan]]. The film chronicles the cross-country journey of college students Walter Gibson (Cusack) and Alison Bradbury (Zuniga) as they make their way from New England to Los Angeles, each in an effort to meet their ideal match.\n\nThe origins of the film came from an experience writer Steven L. Bloom had while attending Brown University. During this time, his best friend was attending Emory University in Atlanta, GA and was constantly recounting the good times he was having while absolutely nothing was going on for Bloom. Out of pity over his situation his friend arranged for him to meet a sure thing over spring break, so Bloom found a ride through a ride board and drove to Atlanta with a number of other students.<ref name=\"dvd\">{{citation |title=The Road To The Sure Thing |work=The Sure Thing: Special Edition DVD |publisher=[[MGM]] |year=2003}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nHigh school senior Walter Gibson and his best friend Lance are celebrating the fact they are moving on to college, but all Walter can do is lament the fact that he has lost his touch with women. Lance heads to UCLA while Walter moves on to college in New England. The two keep in touch by writing letters, but Walter's luck has not changed. His attempt to get close to Alison Bradbury from his English class by tricking her into tutoring him only results in his angering and alienating her. Eventually, he receives a phone call from Lance telling him to come to California for Christmas break because he has set him up with a beautiful girl, assuring him she is a \"sure thing.\"\n\nWalter finds a ride from a ride-share board to make the trip. He meets Gary Cooper and Mary Ann Webster, the couple providing the ride. Things go from bad to worse when he realizes he will be sitting next to Alison as she heads to UCLA to visit her boyfriend Jason. The tension and bickering between Walter and Alison becomes too much for Cooper, and he abandons them on the side of the road in the middle of nowhere and Alison hitches a ride which turns out to be a big mistake. The driver stops at a deserted little pocket of the road and attempts to rape her, but Walter comes to her rescue just in the nick of time. As they hitch to California, they overcome issues with transportation, weather, lack of food, lack of money, and sleeping arrangements, while at the same time developing genuine feelings for one another. En route to California, Alison discovers the real reason Walter made the trip is to meet his \"sure thing\" and angrily walks away after they arrive.\n\nThat night at a college mixer Lance has arranged for Walter to meet his \"sure thing\". Meanwhile, Alison is spending a boring night with Jason when she drags him to the same mixer for some fun. Alison and Walter see each other at the party, but jealousy leads to a confrontation between the two. Walter takes the \"sure thing\" to Lance's room, but cannot stop thinking about Alison.\n\nBack on campus after the break, Alison and Walter are obviously uncomfortable around each other. In their English class, Professor Taub reads an essay composed by Walter as a writing assignment, which is a description of his night with the \"sure thing\". The girl in the essay asks the protagonist if he loves her, but for the first time he realizes that those are not just words and he cannot sleep with her. Alison realizes what actually happened that night, she tells Walter that she and Jason broke up, and they kiss.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[John Cusack]] as Walter \"Gib\" Gibson\n* [[Daphne Zuniga]] as Alison Bradbury\n* [[Nicollette Sheridan]] as \"The Sure Thing\"\n* [[Viveca Lindfors]] as Professor Taub\n* [[Anthony Edwards (actor)|Anthony Edwards]] as Lance\n* [[Tim Robbins]] as Gary Cooper\n* [[Boyd Gaines]] as Jason\n* [[Lisa Jane Persky]] as Mary Ann Webster\n* [[Fran Ryan]] as Lady in Car\n* [[Larry Hankin]] as Trucker\n* [[Sarah Buxton (actress)|Sarah Buxton]] as Sharon\n* [[Robert Bauer (actor)|Robert Bauer]] as Moke\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Casting==\nWhen casting for the part of Walter Gibson began, director [[Rob Reiner]] initially refused to meet with [[John Cusack]] because the actor was under-aged. Casting directors [[Jane Jenkins]] and [[Janet Hirshenson]] convinced Reiner  to audition Cusack, after which Reiner knew he had to have him for the part. At the time [[Anthony Edwards (actor)|Anthony Edwards]] was seriously being considered for the lead, but after Cusack got the part, Edwards was offered the best friend role instead.<ref name= \"dvd2\">{{citation |title=Casting The Sure Thing |work=The Sure Thing: Special Edition DVD |publisher=[[MGM]] |year=2003}}</ref>\n\nAt the time of his casting, Cusack was still 16 and had not yet graduated from high school, so producer [[Roger Birnbaum]] had to go to court to have him [[emancipation of minors|emancipated]].
