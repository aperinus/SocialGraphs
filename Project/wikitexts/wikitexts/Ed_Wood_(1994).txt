The film concerns the period in Wood's life when he made his best-known films as well as his relationship with actor [[Bela Lugosi]], played by [[Martin Landau]]. [[Sarah Jessica Parker]], [[Patricia Arquette]], [[Jeffrey Jones]], [[Lisa Marie (actress)|Lisa Marie]], and [[Bill Murray]] are among the supporting cast.\n\nThe film was conceived by writers [[Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski]] when they were students at the [[USC School of Cinematic Arts]]. Irritated at being thought of solely as writers for [[family film]]s with their work on ''[[Problem Child (film)|Problem Child]]'' (1990) and [[Problem Child 2|its 1991 sequel]], Alexander and Karaszewski struck a deal with Burton and [[Denise Di Novi]] to produce ''Ed Wood''. Initially, [[Michael Lehmann]] was chosen to direct the project, but due to scheduling conflicts with his work on the film ''[[Airheads]]'' (1994), he had to vacate the director's position, which was taken over by Tim Burton.\n\n''Ed Wood'' was originally in development at [[Columbia Pictures]], but the studio put the film in \"[[Turnaround (filmmaking)|turnaround]]\" over Burton's decision to shoot in [[black-and-white]]. ''Ed Wood'' was taken to [[The Walt Disney Studios (division)|Walt Disney Studios]], which produced the film through its [[Touchstone Pictures]] label. The film proved [[Box-office bomb|financially unsuccessful]], returning only $13.8 million against an $18 million budget, but was met with critical acclaim upon release, with particular praise for Depp and Landau's performances and the makeup. It eventually became a cult classic and won two [[Academy Awards]]: [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Supporting Actor]] for Landau and [[Academy Award for Best Makeup and Hairstyling|Best Makeup]] for [[Rick Baker]] (who designed Landau's [[prosthetic makeup]]), [[Ve Neill]] and [[Yolanda Toussieng]].\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1952, [[Ed Wood]] is struggling to enter the [[film industry]]. He has just had the premiere of his play ''The Casual Company''. Ed and the rest of the company are excited to read the reviews and they read a piece by Victor Crowley that condemns the entire piece. Ed confides to his girlfriend Dolores that he just may not have it. She tells him it was one review and things will get better. Upon hearing of an announcement in [[Variety (magazine)|''Variety'']] magazine that producer [[George Weiss (producer)|George Weiss]] is trying to purchase [[Christine Jorgensen]]'s [[Film rights#Life rights|life story]], Ed meets with Weiss to direct a now fictionalized film titled ''I Changed My Sex!'' but is not hired. Ed then meets his longtime idol, horror film actor [[Bela Lugosi]], with whom he becomes friends. Ed persuades Weiss to let him direct the film by convincing him that having a star in the film would sell tickets, and they could sign Lugosi for a low price. During production for ''[[Glen or Glenda]]'', Ed and Weiss argue over the film's title and subject matter but Weiss eventually plays by Ed's rules, albeit reluctantly. Filming gets going, with the story now about a transvestite. Ed takes to film production with an unusual approach; shooting only one take per scene, giving actors very little direction and using stock footage to fill in gaps. The movie is released to critical and commercial failure, preventing Ed from getting work at Weiss' Screen Classics or making a partnership with [[Warner Bros.]] executive Feldman. On the advice of his girlfriend, [[Dolores Fuller]], Ed decides to [[Independent film|finance his next film independently]]. Ed is unsuccessful in finding money for ''Bride of the Atom'', but is introduced to a psychic called [[The Amazing Criswell]] who gives him advice on how to sell himself better. During this time, Ed has discovered that Lugosi has developed a morphine addiction.\n\nEd meets [[Loretta King Hadler|Loretta King]], whom he mistakes for a wealthy heiress and asks her to fund the film and ends up casting her as the lead instead of Fuller as planned with Fuller being assigned a more menial role. Filming begins, but is halted when it is revealed that Loretta is actually poor, so Ed convinces [[meat packing industry]] tycoon Don McCoy to continue funding the film, who agrees as long as his son is cast as the lead and the film ends with an explosion. When filming wraps up, with the title being changed to ''[[Bride of the Monster]]'', Dolores breaks up with Ed after the [[wrap (filmmaking)|wrap party]] because of Ed's cross-dressing, his circle of misfit friends and the poor quality of Ed's movies. Lugosi attempts to conduct a double suicide with Ed after the government cuts off his [[unemployment]] benefit, but is talked out of it. Lugosi checks himself into [[drug rehabilitation|rehab]] to cure his drug addiction, and Ed meets Kathy O'Hara, who is visiting her father there. He takes her on a date and reveals to her his transvestism, which she accepts. After Lugosi is checked out of rehab, he and Ed shoot a film with Lugosi outside his home. Ed and company (along with TV horror icon [[Maila Nurmi|Vampira]]) attend the premiere for ''Bride of the Monster'', where an angry mob chases them out of the theater.\n\nAfterwards, Lugosi passes away, leaving Ed without a star. After learning that his landlord's church is struggling to produce a series of religious films about the twelve apostles, Ed convinces him to allow his church to fund his script for a sci-fi film, ''Grave Robbers from Outer Space'', which could result in a box-office success and generate enough money for Reynolds' dream project. Ed hires Vampira and Kathy's chiropractor Dr. [[Tom Mason (actor, born 1920)|Tom Mason]] to star in the film (the latter being a stand in for Lugosi) and also has conflicts with the Baptists over the title, script content and Ed's [[B movie]] directing style, eventually renaming the film ''[[Plan 9 from Outer Space]]''. Ed soon leaves the set out of frustration to go to the nearest [[bar (establishment)|bar]], where he has an encounter with filmmaker [[Orson Welles]], who rekindles Ed's inspiration by advising him to assert his vision and resist artistic changes imposed onto him by sponsors. Filming finishes with Ed taking action against his producers' wishes. After attending the premiere, Ed and Kathy go to [[Las Vegas]] to get married.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Johnny Depp]] as [[Ed Wood]]: Burton approached Depp and \"within 10 minutes of hearing about the project, I was committed,\" the actor remembers.<ref name= \"Arnold, Gary\">{{cite news | author = Gary Arnold | title = Depp sees promise in cult filmmaker Ed Wood's story | work = [[The Washington Times]] | date = 1994-10-02 }}</ref> At the time, Depp was depressed about films and filmmaking.

[[Rick Baker (makeup artist)|Rick Baker]] created Martin's [[prosthetic makeup]]. Baker did not use extensive make-up appliances, only enough to resemble Lugosi and allow Landau to use his face to act and express emotion which consisted of a set of ears, nose, chin, and an appliance that covered his upper lip.<ref name= \"French, Lawrence\">{{cite news | author = Lawrence French | title = Playing Bela Lugosi | work = [[Cinefantastique]] | pages = 24\u201325 | date = October 1994 }}</ref> For research, Landau watched 25 of Lugosi's films and seven interviews between the years of 1931 and 1956.<ref name= \"French, Lawrence\"/> Landau did not want to deliver an over-the-top performance. \"Lugosi was theatrical, but I never wanted the audience to feel I was an actor chewing the scenery...

Dolores is embarrassed by Ed's transvestism, which leads to their breakup. Dolores later becomes a successful songwriter for [[Elvis Presley]].\n* [[Patricia Arquette]] as Kathy O'Hara: Ed's girlfriend after his relationship with Dolores. Kathy does not have a problem with Ed's transvestism, and eventually marries Ed. Their marriage lasts until Ed's death in 1978. She never remarried.

Paul is hired to find the Lugosi stand-in for ''Plan 9 from Outer Space'', while Conrad accidentally has a brief dispute with Lugosi during ''Glen or Glenda''.\n* [[George Steele|George \"The Animal\" Steele]] as [[Tor Johnson]]: A Swedish [[professional wrestler]] hired by Wood to be in two of his films, ''Bride of the Monster'' and ''Plan 9''.\n* [[Juliet Landau]] as [[Loretta King Hadler|Loretta King]]: King replaces Dolores in ''Bride of the Monster'' after Wood mistakes her for an heiress able to front the money for the production costs.\n* [[Ned Bellamy]] as [[Tom Mason (actor, born 1920)|Tom Mason]]: Kathy's [[chiropractic|chiropractor]] who is chosen to be Lugosi's [[stand-in]] for ''Plan 9''.\n* [[Mike Starr (actor)|Mike Starr]] as [[George Weiss (producer)|George Weiss]]: Short-tempered and foul-mouthed [[Z movie]] producer, known for his work on exploitation films.

He was taken by how he \"wrote about his films as if he was making ''[[Citizen Kane]]'', you know, whereas other people perceived them as, like, the worst movies ever\".<ref name= \"Dwyer\"/> Burton admits to having always been a fan of Ed Wood, which is why the biopic is filmed with an aggrandizing bias born of his admiration for Wood's work, rather than the derisive attitude of Wood's detractors.<ref name= \"Thompson2\">{{cite news | author = Bob Thompson | title = Beyond the Fringe | newspaper = [[Toronto Sun]] | date = 1994-10-04 }}</ref> The relationship between Wood and Lugosi in the script echoes closely Burton's relationship with his own idol and two-time colleague, [[Vincent Price]].

Burton read the first draft and immediately agreed to direct the film as it stood, without any changes or rewrites.<ref name=hard>Salisbury, Burton, pp. 128-130</ref> ''Ed Wood'' gave Burton the opportunity to make a film that was more character-driven as opposed to style-driven.

He insisted on total creative control, and so in April 1993, a month before the original start date, Canton put ''Ed Wood'' into [[turnaround (filmmaking)|turnaround]]. The decision sparked interest from [[Warner Bros.]], [[Paramount Pictures]] and [[20th Century Fox]] in [[option (finance)|option]]ing the [[film rights]], but Burton accepted an offer from [[The Walt Disney Studios (division)|Walt Disney Studios]], who had previously produced ''The Nightmare Before Christmas''. Similar to ''Nightmare'', Disney released ''Ed Wood'' under their [[Touchstone Pictures]] banner. With a budget of $18 million, Disney did not feel the film was that much of a risk, and granted Burton total creative autonomy.

In doing a biopic you can't help but get inside the person's spirit a little bit, so for me, some of the film is trying to be through Ed a little bit. So it's got an overly optimistic quality to it.\"<ref name=hard/> Burton acknowledged that he probably portrayed Wood and his crew in an exaggeratedly sympathetic way, stating he did not want to ridicule people who had already been ridiculed for a good deal of their life. Burton decided not to depict the darker side of Wood's life because his letters never alluded to this aspect and remained upbeat. To this end, Burton wanted to make the film through Wood's eyes.<ref name= \"Thompson2\"/> He said in an interview, \"I've never seen anything like them, the kind of bad poetry and redundancy\u2013 saying in, like, five sentences what it would take most normal people one ... Yet still there is a sincerity to them that is very unusual, and I always found that somewhat touching; it gives them a surreal, weirdly heartfelt feeling.\"<ref name= \"Smith, Gavin\">{{cite news | author = Gavin Smith | title = Tim Burton: Punching Holes in Reality | work = [[Film Comment]] | pages = 52\u201363 | date = November\u2013December 1994 }}</ref>\n\nAccording to Bela G. Lugosi (his son), [[Forrest Ackerman]], [[Dolores Fuller]] and Richard Sheffield, the film's portrayal of Lugosi is inaccurate: in real life, he never used profanity, owned small dogs, or slept in coffins. Additionally, contrary to what was presented in the film, Bela was not thrown by a comic's ad-libbing in a skit on a TV show involving Wood, but on another show years earlier before the two ever met.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Rhodes|first1=Gary|last2=Sheffield|first2=Richard|title=Bela Lugosi: Dreams and Nightmares|date=2007|publisher=Collectables Press|isbn=978-0977379811}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Rhodes|first1=Gary|last2=Weaver|first2=Tom|title=Ed Wood's Bride of the Monster|date=2015|publisher=BearManor Media|isbn=978-1593938574}}</ref>\n\nBurton biographer Ken Hanke criticized the depiction of Dolores Fuller. \"The real Fuller is a lively, savvy, humorous woman,\" Hanke said, \"while Parker's performance presents her as a kind of sitcom moron for the first part of the film and a rather judgmental and wholly unpleasant character in her later scenes.\"<ref name=forward>Hanke, Chapter 17: \"Visions Worth Fighting For\", p. 167\u2014182</ref> During her years with Wood, Fuller had regular TV jobs on ''[[Queen for a Day]]'' and ''[[The Dinah Shore Show]]'', which are not mentioned. Fuller criticized Parker's portrayal and Burton's direction, but still gave ''Ed Wood'' a positive review. \"Despite the dramatic liberties, I think Tim Burton is fabulous. I wished they could have made it a deeper love story, because we really loved each other.
