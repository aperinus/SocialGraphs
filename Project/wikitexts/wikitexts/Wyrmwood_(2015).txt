During a [[meteor shower]], Barry's sister Brooke is attacked in her [[Bulla, Victoria]] studio by her model and her assistant, who have suddenly become zombies. She calls Barry and warns him to get out of the city. He, Annie, and Meganne don gas masks and fight their way to the family car. When Meganne and Annie remove their gas masks they become infected and zombify, and Barry is forced to kill them with a nailgun. He runs out of nails before he can kill himself.\n\nChalker, another survivor, finds Barry and knocks him unconscious when Barry attempts to kill himself with Chalker's gun. Barry asks Chalker to take him to Brooke's studio, unaware that a paramilitary group has taken her captive in the back of a truck that serves as a mobile lab for mad scientist Doc. While Doc experiments on the zombies and Brooke, Chalker's truck stops working. Chalker and Barry continue on foot, and Benny, another survivor, mistakenly kills Chalker. Benny, who previously had to kill his infected brother, and Barry team up and come upon a garage staffed by Frank and his assistant. Frank explains that all flammable liquids have become useless. However, the group accidentally discovers zombie breath and blood are flammable, and they devise a zombie-powered engine. During their escape, Frank's assistant becomes infected and is used as fuel.\n\nBarry, Benny, and Frank discover zombies stop breathing flammable gas at night, enabling them to run faster. As they hole up in the truck overnight, Frank says he believes the zombies resulted from the meteor shower; as told in the Bible, a star called Wyrmwood has fallen, making part of the world bitter. After waking up from a nightmare, Barry catches a zombie on fire and accidentally sets the truck's compressor alight. While putting out the fire, Frank is bitten and asks Barry to shoot him; Barry does. The next day, Barry and Benny encounter paramilitaries in an electric-powered truck. The two drivers, after revealing that those with an A negative blood type are not affected by the disease, offer to lead Barry and Benny to Brooke, who they claim is in custody nearby. Meanwhile, Brooke learns she can now telepathically control zombies as a result of the experiments. With the help of several zombies, she kills Doc, escapes the truck, and joins Barry and Benny.\n\nBarry's truck stalls after the soldiers accidentally kill the zombie powering it. While taking a pit stop for Brooke to fetch them a zombie, Benny is shot in the stomach. When they later pull over to take care of Benny, the soldiers catch up and subdue them. The soldiers reveal their plan is to decapitate Brooke and take her head to their commanding officer. Barry plans to kill them all in an explosion, but Benny instead sacrifices himself to turn into a zombie so Brooke can control him to overpower the soldiers. He kills two of the three soldiers, but the captain kills him and shoots Brooke in the chest. Barry challenges him to a fistfight but ends up shot when the captain retrieves his pistol. After shooting a zombie, the captain's face is splattered with zombie blood, and Barry ignites his head with the matches. Before Barry can shoot him, Brooke rises and commands a horde of zombies to eat the captain alive.\n\nBarry and Brooke, back on the road, come across the lab truck again. They ask the soldiers what they have in the back of the truck; when they refuse to answer, Brooke commands a new group of zombies to attack them and tear them apart.\n\n==Cast==\n*Jay Gallagher as Barry\n*Bianca Bradey as Brooke\n*[[Leon Burchill]] as Benny\n*Luke McKenzie as The Captain\n*Yure Covich as Chalker\n*[[Catherine Terracini]] as Annie\n*Keith Agius as Frank\n*Meganne West as Meganne\n*Berynn Schwerdt as The Doctor\n*Cain Thompson as McGaughlin\n*Beth Aubrey as Charlotte\n*Sheridan Harbridge as Sherri\n*Damian Dyke as Thompson\n\n==Reception==\n{{expand section|date=February 2015}}\nCritical reception for ''Wyrmwood'' has been positive,<ref>{{cite web|last1=Macomber|first1=Sean|title=\"WYRMWOOD\" (Toronto After Dark Review)|url=http://www.fangoria.com/new/wyrmwood-toronto-after-dark-review/|publisher=Fangoria|accessdate=7 November 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Adams|first1=Mark|title=Wyrmwood (review)|url=http://www.screendaily.com/reviews/the-latest/wyrmwood/5077984.article|work=Screen Daily|accessdate=7 November 2014}}</ref> earning an approval rating of 79% on [[Rotten Tomatoes]].
