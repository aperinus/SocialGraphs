Now Helen is the executive assistant to the CEO of one of Manhattan's most prestigious modeling agencies, and has a nice [[Manhattan]] lifestyle which keeps her extremely occupied and content. But her world suddenly changes when Lindsay and brother-in-law Paul die in a car accident, leaving her their three children.\n\nHelen and Jenny are in shock when they discover Lindsay and Paul left Helen guardian to the three kids: Audrey, 15, Henry, 10, and Sarah, 5. They are surprised as Jenny was already a great mother with two children and a third on the way. But a letter left to Helen by Lindsay convinces her to take care of them. She tries to do it on her own terms: raising them while maintaining her already fast-paced schedule. But as work and children begin to interfere, Helen quickly finds herself burnt out and disheartened by her responsibilities and Jenny's lack of faith.\n\nDespite her already hectic schedule, Helen finds the time to develop a genuine affection for her new dependents, as well as an equally genuine attraction to Dan Parker, the kids' school principal and local [[Lutheran]] pastor. Busy trying to appease the children and adjust to suddenly being a mom, Helen's concentration on her job begins to slip and she is fired by Dominique.\n\nHelen becomes a receptionist at a car dealership. Things begin to improve as she bonds with the children and Dan, and finally begins to get the hang of being a mom. But Audrey falls in with the wrong crowd and dates the wrong kind of guy. When she disappears from the prom with her new boyfriend BZ to a motel, Helen is forced to call in Jenny as back-up to search all over New York to find Audrey. Unable to confront her and risk her hatred, once they track her down, Helen turns the children over into Jenny's custody.\n\nHelen returns to her wild lifestyle, yet feels much less fulfilled than she had been before she had the children. Feeling dissatisfied and depressed, she returns to Jenny's house to take the children back. She convinces her she's finally ready to be a parent when she puts her foot down and shows Audrey who's boss. Jenny, listening to Helen talking to the children, still refusing to give them back that night.\n\nHelen leaves and is sitting alone in a park. There, Jenny appears and gives her the letter that Lindsay had written to her. Helen reads it, which explains why Lindsay chose her, someone more like herself, someone who can give the children the mother they really want.\n\nWhile watching out her window the next day, Helen turns around with joy when the kids arrive, now hers.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n*[[Kate Hudson]] as Helen Harris\n*[[John Corbett]] as Pastor Dan Parker, Helen's love interest\n*[[Joan Cusack]] as Jenny Portman, Helen's older sister\n*[[Hayden Panettiere]] as Audrey Davis, Helen's niece\n*[[Spencer Breslin]] as Henry Davis, Helen's nephew\n*[[Abigail Breslin]] as Sarah Davis, Helen's niece\n*[[Helen Mirren]] as Dominique\n*[[Sakina Jaffrey]] as Nilma Prasad\n*[[Kevin Kilner]] as Ed Portman, Jenny's husband\n*[[Paris Hilton]] as Amber\n*[[Felicity Huffman]] as Lindsay Davis, Helen's older sister (the late mother of Audrey, Henry & Sarah)\n*[[Sean O'Bryan]] as Paul Davis, Lindsay's husband (the late father of Audrey, Henry & Sarah)\n*Catherine Tayrien as Jasmine Portman, Jenny & Ed's daughter\n*Evan Sabara as Oliver Portman, Jenny & Ed's son\n*[[Amber Valletta]] as Martina\n*Ethan Browne as Devon\n*[[Joseph Mazzello]] as Prom Date Peter\n*Michael Esparza as BZ\n*[[Katie Carr]] as Caitlin\n*[[Rio Hackford]] as Brunch Maitre d'\n*[[H\u00e9ctor Elizondo]] as Mickey Massey\n*[[Larry Miller (comedian)|Larry Miller]] as Leo D'Leo\n*[[Shakara Ledard]] as 'Tinka' (the model)\n}}\n\n==Music==\nThe featured song ''[[Whip It (Devo song)|Whip It]]'' by [[Devo]] was used in the movie.
