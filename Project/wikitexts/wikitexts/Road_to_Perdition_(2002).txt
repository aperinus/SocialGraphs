The screenplay was adapted by [[David Self]] from the [[Road to Perdition (comics)|graphic novel of the same name]] written by [[Max Allan Collins]] and illustrated by [[Richard Piers Rayner]]. The film stars [[Tom Hanks]], [[Paul Newman]] (in his final live-action theatrical film acting role), [[Jude Law]], and [[Daniel Craig]]. The plot takes place in 1931, during the [[Great Depression]], following a [[mob enforcer]] and his son as they seek vengeance against a mobster who murdered the rest of their family.\n\nFilming took place in the [[Chicago]] area. Mendes, having recently finished 1999's acclaimed ''[[American Beauty (1999 film)|American Beauty]]'', pursued a story that had minimal dialogue and conveyed emotion in the imagery. Cinematographer [[Conrad Hall|Conrad L. Hall]] took advantage of the environment to create symbolism for the film, for which he won several awards, including a posthumous [[Academy Award for Best Cinematography]]. The film explores several themes, including the consequence of violence and father-son relationships.\n\n''Road to Perdition'' was released on July 12, 2002, and eventually grossed over $181 million worldwide. The film was well received by critics, who mainly praised the direction and visuals, performances (particularly of Hanks,  Newman, and Law), cinematography, themes and setting. In addition to Hall's win for cinematography, the film earned five [[Academy Awards]] nominations, including [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Supporting Actor]] for Newman.\n\n==Plot==\nThe film begins and ends in 1931 during the [[Great Depression in the United States|Great Depression]] with a voiceover from Michael Sullivan, Jr., speaking about his father. Michael Sullivan, Sr. was orphaned and then raised by [[Irish Mob]] boss [[John Patrick Looney|John Rooney]] in [[Rock Island, Illinois|Rock Island]], [[Illinois]]; he is now Rooney's most fearsome enforcer, unknown to his own children. Rooney has come to love Sullivan more than his own biological son, the rash and unpredictable Connor.\n\nSpeaking at his brother's wake, Rooney's associate Finn McGovern insinuates that Rooney is responsible for his brother's death. Rooney sends Connor and Sullivan to talk with McGovern, while 12-year-old Michael watches through a hole in the wall, after hiding in the back of the family car. McGovern steadfastly denies that his brother stole anything from the mob before implying Connor was responsible, and Connor shoots him on the spot before Sullivan shoots the other witnesses. Michael is detected and sworn to secrecy.\n\nThe next day, Rooney visits the house to intimidate the boy, and Michael soon begins misbehaving at school. At a meeting with his mob associates, Rooney pointedly humiliates Connor after he halfheartedly apologizes for McGovern's murder. Then he sends Sullivan to collect a debt from a [[speakeasy]] owner Tony Calvino. Connor, jealous and afraid, sends a letter with Sullivan for Calvino. Calvino reads it then reaches for his revolver, but Sullivan kills both Calvino and his bodyguard. The letter reads \"Kill Sullivan and all debts are paid,\" and he rushes home. When he arrives he discovers Connor has already murdered his wife, Annie, and their younger son, Peter, but not Michael, who had arrived home late from detention.\n\nSullivan and Michael flee Rock Island and head to Chicago to meet [[Frank Nitti]]. He offers to work for the [[Chicago Outfit]] in exchange for permission to kill Connor, but Nitti rejects the offer. Rooney, listening next door with Connor, reluctantly allows Nitti to dispatch [[Contract killing|freelance killer]] Harlen Maguire, who doubles as a [[Forensic photography|crime scene photographer]], to kill Sullivan. Nitti suggests Michael must be killed as well to prevent him seeking revenge in the future, but Rooney refuses. However, Nitti secretly orders Maguire to kill Michael as well. Maguire tracks Sullivan to a roadside diner. The two meet and have a seemingly casual conversation while Michael hides in the car. Sensing the danger, Sullivan escapes the diner through the bathroom window and slashes Maguire's tires before driving away.\n\nSullivan now plots to force the Outfit to give up Connor by robbing the banks that hold its money. He teaches Michael to drive in order to become their getaway driver. Sullivan is impeded when the mob withdraws its money, so he visits Rooney's accountant Alexander Rance. Rance stalls Sullivan until Maguire enters with a shotgun, killing Rance while Sullivan escapes with Rooney's ledgers. However, during the escape, Maguire shoots Sullivan in the arm. Michael drives them to a farm after Sullivan collapses from his wound, where an elderly childless couple helps him recover. Sullivan's bond with his son grows and Michael comes to realize his father loves him.\n\nThe ledgers reveal that Connor has been embezzling from his father for years, using the names of dead men including McGovern. Believing Rooney will call off the hit on him if he knows the truth, Sullivan gifts the couple a chunk of the stolen cash and heads back to Chicago. Sullivan confronts Rooney at Mass, learning Rooney already knows about Connor and expects he will be killed \u2013 if not by Sullivan, then by Nitti's men once Rooney is dead. He still refuses to give up his son and urges Sullivan to flee with Michael and ensure he becomes a better man than either of them.\n\nLater one night, cloaked by darkness and rain, Sullivan ambushes and kills Rooney's bodyguards with his [[Thompson submachine gun|Tommy Gun]] and walks up to Rooney. As Rooney mutters \"I'm glad it's you\", Sullivan reluctantly shoots him. Having no further reasons to protect Connor now that Rooney is dead, Nitti reveals Connor's location after Sullivan promises the feud ends with his death. Sullivan goes to the hotel where Connor is hiding and kills him in the bathtub.\n\nSullivan takes his son to his Aunt Sarah's beach house in Perdition, on the shore of [[Lake Michigan]], where he is ambushed and shot by Maguire inside the house as Michael stands on the beach. As Maguire photographs the dying Sullivan, Michael appears and points a gun at Maguire but cannot bring himself to pull the trigger. As Maguire beckons to Michael to give him the gun, Sullivan fatally shoots Maguire. Sullivan tells his son he knew he couldn't do it before dying in his arms.\n\nMichael says his father's fear was that he would follow the same road, and that he has not held a gun since his father died. Michael drives the car back to the farm, saying he grew up there, and now when he is asked if his father was a good man, he just tells them, \"He was my father.\"\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Tom Hanks]] as Michael Sullivan\n* [[Tyler Hoechlin]] as Michael Sullivan Jr.\n* [[Paul Newman]] as John Rooney (based on [[John Patrick Looney]])\n* [[Jude Law]] as Harlen Maguire\n* [[Daniel Craig]] as Connor Rooney\n* [[Stanley Tucci]] as [[Frank Nitti]]\n* [[Jennifer Jason Leigh]] as Annie Sullivan\n* [[Liam Aiken]] as Peter Sullivan\n* [[Dylan Baker]] as Alexander Rance\n* [[Ciar\u00e1n Hinds]] as Finn McGovern\n* [[David Darlow (actor)|David Darlow]] as Jack Kelly\n* [[Kerry Rossall]] as Rooney's Henchman (uncredited)\n* [[Anthony LaPaglia]] as [[Al Capone]] (uncredited)\n* [[Kevin Chamberlin]] as Frank the Bouncer\n* [[Harry Groener]] as Mr. McDougal\n* [[JoBe Cerny]] as Banker (as Jobe Cerny)\n{{Div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nWhen [[Max Allan Collins]] wrote the graphic novel ''[[Road to Perdition (comics)|Road to Perdition]]'', his book agent saw potential in the story as a film adaptation and showed it to a film agent.<ref name=\"Facts\">{{cite news |author=Singh, Arune |url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/news/newsitem.cgi?id=1240 |title=Just The Facts Ma'am: Max Collins Talks 'Road To Perdition' |work=[[Comic Book Resources]] |date=2002-06-16 |access-date=2007-06-06}}</ref> By 1999, the novel had reached Dean Zanuck, who was the vice president of development at the company owned by his father, producer [[Richard D.

DreamWorks sent Mendes ''Road to Perdition'' as a prospect, and Mendes was attracted to the story, considering it \"narratively very simple, but thematically very complex\".<ref name=\"Killer\"/> He specified one theme being the parents' world is inaccessible to their children. Mendes considered the story's theme to be about how children deal with violence, and whether exposure to violence would render children violent themselves. Mendes described the script as having \"no moral absolutes\", a factor that appealed to the director.<ref name=\"Rumblings\">{{cite news |author=Stax|url=http://movies.ign.com/articles/317/317759p1.html |title=Rumblings on 'The Road to Perdition'|work=[[IGN]] |date=2002-01-24|access-date=2007-06-06}}</ref>\n\n=== Writing ===\nSpielberg first contacted screenwriter [[David Self]] to adapt the story into a feature film.<ref name=\"Killer\"/> Self wrote an initial draft that remained close to the source material and retained most of its dialogue. The screenplay was then rewritten by uncredited writers, distancing the script from the graphic novel and leaving the core elements of the story.<ref name=\"Facts\"/> Some of the harsher aspects of the story were toned down as the script became more streamlined; for example, in some early drafts of the screenplay, Sullivan became an [[alcoholic]], but this element was ultimately absent from the final version.<ref name=\"Killer\"/>\n\nThe story itself is deeply informed by the ''[[Lone Wolf and Cub]]'' [[manga]] series. Novelist Max Allan Collins acknowledged the influence of ''Lone Wolf and Cub'' on his graphic novel ''Road to Perdition'' in an interview to the BBC, declaring that \"''Road To Perdition'' is 'an unabashed homage' to ''Lone Wolf and Cub''\".<ref>Allan Collins, Max.

One significant addition to the script was the creation of Maguire to provide a persistent element of pursuit to the Sullivans' departure from the old world.<ref name=\"Facts\" />\n\nHanks and cinematographer [[Conrad Hall]] requested Mendes to limit violence in the film to meaningful acts, rather than gratuitous carnage. Hanks' character, Michael Sullivan, is known as \"The Angel of Death\" in the graphic novel and invokes fear in those around him, but his infamy is downplayed in the film.<ref name=\"Rumblings\"/> Mendes, who described the graphic novel as \"much more pulpy\", sought to reduce the graphic novel's background to its essence, seeking the \"nonverbal simplicity\" of films like ''[[Once Upon a Time in America]]'' (1984), ''[[Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid]]'' (1973),<ref name=\"Killer\"/> and films by [[Akira Kurosawa]] that lack dialogue.<ref name=\"Self\"/> Duplicate language in characters' confrontations in ''Road to Perdition'' was trimmed to the absolute minimum.<ref name=\"Paul\">{{cite news |author=Lyman, Rick |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2002/sep/15/features.review |title=So, as Paul said to Tom ...|work=[[The Guardian]] |date=2002-09-15 |access-date=2010-04-24 |location=London}}</ref> Mendes described ''Road to Perdition'' as a \"poetic, elegiac story, in which the pictures tell the story\".<ref name=\"Power\"/> An example of one such unspoken scene in the film was the piano duet between Rooney and Michael Sr., intended to convey their relationship without words.<ref name=\"Paul\"/> In the final 20 minutes of ''Road to Perdition'', the script was written to have only six lines of dialogue.<ref name=\"Power\"/>\n\nMax Allan Collins originally wanted to write the adapted screenplay, but was not given the opportunity.<ref name=\"Facts\"/> He chose to stay out of the scripting process out of respect for the different style of writing for a different medium, though he served as a consultant in the process.

In the graphic novel, the son kills once, and in the film, he does not kill anyone. Collins also disagreed with the narration technique of the film. In the novel, the son narrates the story as an adult, becoming a priest, while in the film, he narrates while still a young boy.<ref>{{cite news |author=Duerson, Adam |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,321309~1~0~howroadtoperdition,00.html |title='Road' Warrior|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |date=2002-07-17|access-date=2007-06-07}}</ref>\n\n===Casting===\nTom Hanks was sent a copy of the graphic novel by [[Steven Spielberg]] while he was filming ''[[Cast Away]]''. Initially too busy to make sense of the story, he later received David Self's adapted screenplay, to which he became attached.

[[General Jones Armory]], the state's largest location mainstay which houses units of the [[Illinois National Guard]], was provided to the studio by the Illinois State Film Commission. Sets were built inside the armory, including interiors of the Sullivan family's home and the Rooney mansion. The availability of an inside location provided the crew complete control over the lighting environment, which was established with the rigging of [[scaffolding]]s.<ref name=\"Triggers\">{{cite news|author=Zone, Ray |url=http://www.theasc.com/magazine/aug02/perdition/index.html |title=Emotional Triggers|work=[[American Cinematographer]] |date=August 2002 |access-date=2007-06-06}}</ref>\n{{Quote box|width=40%|Atmospherically, the landscape is a violent and magnificent canvas on which is told a mythic story of a father and son in the last period of lawlessness in American history.|Sam Mendes<ref name=\"Triggers\" />}}\nMendes collaborated with costume designer Albert Wolsky, production designer [[Dennis Gassner]], and cinematographer [[Conrad Hall]] to design the film's style. Wolsky designed costumes that were \"very controlled, with soft outlines and very soft silhouettes\". Gassner built sets that could capture the cold look of the era. Mendes sought a muted palette for the film, having dark backgrounds and sets with dark, muted greens and grays. Mendes filmed ''Road to Perdition'' using the [[Super 35]] format.<ref name=\"Triggers\"/>\n\nThe director filmed exterior scenes in Illinois in the winter and the spring of 2001, using real weather conditions such as snow, rain, and mud for the scenes. Mendes considered the usage of bleak weather conditions and the intended coldness of Gassner's exterior locations to define the characters' emotional states. Pullman became a key location to reflect this theme, having several settings, including the town's historic Florence Hotel, easily redressed by the crew for the film.<ref name=\"Triggers\" /> Filming concluded in June 2001.<ref name=\"Killer\" />\n\n===Cinematography===\n[[File:Perdition cinematography.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Cinematographer Conrad Hall set up atmospheric lighting similar to that found in the paintings of [[Edward Hopper]]]] To establish the lighting of scenes in ''Road to Perdition'', Mendes drew from the paintings of [[Edward Hopper]] as a source of inspiration, particularly Hopper's ''New York Movie'' (1939). Mendes and cinematographer [[Conrad Hall]] sought to convey similar atmospheric lighting for the film's scenes, applying a \"less is more\" mantra.<ref>{{cite news |author=Ray Zone |url=http://www.theasc.com/magazine/aug02/perdition/sidebar1.html |title=A Master of Mood |work=[[American Cinematographer]] |access-date=2007-06-06}}</ref> Hall also shot at wide apertures that retained one point in the [[depth of field]] sharply focused. Hall considered the technique to provide an emotional dimension to the scenes. The cinematographer also used unconventional techniques and materials to create unique lighting effects. One of Hall's methods was to use black silk in daylight exterior scenes to filter the light enough to create an in-shade look.<ref name=\"Triggers\" />\n\nHall purposely distanced the camera from Hanks' character, Michael Sullivan Sr., at the beginning of the film to establish the perspective of Sullivan's son, who is unaware of his father's true nature.<ref name=\"Killer\" /> Hanks's character was filmed as partially obscured and seen through doorways, and his entrances and exits took place in shadows. A wide lens was used to maintain a distance from the character.<ref name=\"Triggers\" />\n\nShots in the film were drawn directly from panels in the graphic novel, illustrated by Richard Piers Rayner. An instance of the direct influence is the scene in which Michael Jr. looks up at the Chicago skyline from the vehicle, with the skyline reflected in the vehicle's glass.<ref name=\"Self\"/>\n\nA seamless 40-second driving scene, in which Michael Sullivan and his son travel into Chicago from the countryside, was aided by visual effects. The live-action part of the scene was filmed at [[LaSalle Street]], and due to the lack of scenery for part of the drive down LaSalle Street, the background of Balbo Drive was included with the use of visual effects.<ref>{{cite news |author=Heuring, David |url=http://www.theasc.com/magazine/aug02/perdition/sidebar2.html |title=Effecting a Key Transition |work=[[American Cinematographer]] |access-date=2007-06-06}}</ref>\n\n===Music===\nSee ''[[Road to Perdition (soundtrack)]]''\n\n==Themes==\n===Consequences of violence===\n{{Quote box|width=40%|[What's] important, in this story, is what the violence does to the person who pulls the trigger, and what it has done to them over the years, how it has gradually corroded them.

Sullivan is a good father and husband, but also has a job that requires him to be a violent killer. The film explores this paradoxical [[dichotomy]].

Sullivan simultaneously idolizes and fears Rooney, and Sullivan's son feels the same about his own father. Rooney's son, Connor, has none of Sullivan's redeeming qualities, and Rooney is conflicted about whom to protect: his biological son or his surrogate son. Connor is jealous of his father's relationship with Sullivan, which fuels his actions, ultimately causing a [[domino effect]] that drives the film.<ref name=\"Fathers\" />\n\nBecause Sullivan shields his background from his son, his attempt to preserve the father-son relationship is actually harmful.
