It was written by [[J. Michael Straczynski]] and directed by [[Jes\u00fas Salvador Trevi\u00f1o]].\n\nThe movie was originally shown on July 19, 1998 on the [[TNT (American TV network)|TNT]] cable network, during the run of season five (originally being shown between \"[[Movements of Fire and Shadow]]\" and \"[[The Fall of Centauri Prime]]\"). In addition to members of the regular cast of the ''Babylon 5'' TV series, it features the notable guest-stars [[Shari Belafonte]] (playing Dr. Elizabeth Trent) and [[William Sanderson]] (reprising the role of \"Deuce\" that he played in the episode \"[[Grail (Babylon 5)|Grail]]\").\n\nThe horror-based story, which ties into the [[Shadow (Babylon 5)|Shadow]]/[[Vorlon]] plotline, centers on the return of an ancient and overwhelming alien force which had once attempted to destroy life in the [[Milky Way]].\n\n==Plot==\nAn enormous [[artifact (archaeology)|artifact]] is discovered in [[hyperspace (science fiction)|hyperspace]] and is towed to ''[[Babylon 5 (fictional space station)|Babylon 5]]'' for investigation. The [[xenoarchaeology]] corporation Interplanetary Expeditions sends a representative, Dr. Elizabeth Trent, to take control of the artifact's examination.\n\nThe artifact begins to influence the dreams of many inhabitants of ''Babylon 5'', eventually controlling many of them during their waking hours as well. These [[thrall]]s, led by Deuce, first demand that the excavation be accelerated, and then become increasingly violent towards the rest of the ''Babylon 5'' population. Dr. Trent conjectures that the artifact is a Jumpgate that takes one neither to normal space nor to hyperspace but to a \"third\" space (hence the movie's title). With the reluctant support of her colleague, they order the device to be turned on, without notifying [[John Sheridan (Babylon 5)|Captain Sheridan]].\n\nSheridan and [[Delenn]] visit [[Lyta Alexander]], who, transmitting a \"[[race memory]]\", explains that the gate was built by the [[Vorlon]]s a million years ago with a purpose that cannot be expressed in human terms except as an attempt to make contact with the gods. The Vorlons discovered that Thirdspace is a [[Parallel universe (fiction)|parallel universe]] inhabited by a violent, telepathic alien species even older and more powerful than the Vorlons that is bent on exterminating all life other than their own.\n\nLong ago, the Thirdspace aliens telepathically converted a small army of Vorlons to fight and die for them. The ensuing battle ended in a [[stalemate]]; the non-thrall Vorlons shut down the gate, but the remaining Vorlon thralls prevented the artifact's destruction by sending it into hyperspace where it was lost but preserved (in hopes that it might one day be reawakened). Lyta then telepathically informs Captain Sheridan how to deactivate the gate.\n\nWhen the device is finally reactivated, the Thirdspace aliens stream out from the portal in small fighters and begin a devastating assault on ''Babylon 5'', obliterating large cruisers with little effort.  The Thirdspace fleet is highly advanced and the single-occupant fighters possess deflector shield technology, making them extremely hard to destroy.  The violent behavior of the individuals under the artifact's control is intended to disrupt the station's defenses.  The struggle is ended when Sheridan uses a [[thermonuclear device]] to destroy the artifact just as the first wave of Thirdspace heavy warships begins to emerge.  Once the artifact is destroyed, the telepathic influence stops and the station returns to normal.  Trent, shaken by the way in which the artifact affected her, turns over her final report and goes on an indefinite hiatus.\n\nSheridan and the others conceal the true nature of the artifact from those who ask questions and confidently assure themselves that the incident is unlikely to occur again.  In private, Lyta broods with the knowledge that the artifact was only one of many mistakes the Vorlons have made.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Bruce Boxleitner]] as Capt. John J.

The presence of both [[Stephen Franklin (Babylon 5)|Dr. Franklin]] and [[Delenn]], along with changes to [[Zack Allan]]'s uniform, further place the events during or just before episode 409 \"[[Atonement (Babylon 5)|Atonement]]\", to the extent that its continuity problems can actually be resolved.<ref name=\"Lurker112\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.midwinter.com/lurk/guide/112.html |title=Guide Page: 'Thirdspace' |work=The Lurker's Guide to Babylon 5 |last=Grimm |first=Steven |publisher=Midwinter Software |location=[[Sunnyvale, CA]] |pages=\"Episode List\" section |date=February 12, 2005 |access-date=November 6, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081028225117/http://www.midwinter.com/lurk/guide/112.html |archivedate=October 28, 2008  |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nWhile a stand-alone story, it does include a scene in which Zack Allan finally reveals his feelings outright to Lyta Alexander, unaware that she is being telepathically dominated and not hearing a word he says. This sheds some new light on their somewhat uncomfortable friendship and his jealousy of her relationship with another telepath, Byron, that would occur in Season 5.\n\nIn the season 5 episode \"[[The Fall of Centauri Prime]]\", Delenn (while talking to [[Lennier]] about themselves drifting in hyperspace) appears to refer obliquely to the events of this film by pondering, \"Who knows what's out there; maybe we'll find a million-year-old jumpgate left over by the First Ones.\"\n\nThe fictional artifact was designed by science fiction and fantasy artist [[Wayne Barlowe]] after the script was written. In the novelization, the description of the artifact does not match what appears in the film. Most notably, the artifact in the novel formed into a jump gate that was larger than the station when it became operational. In the film, however, it rearranged itself and actually decreased in size.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|id=0121804|title=Babylon 5: Thirdspace}}\n* {{amg movie|224761|Babylon 5: Thirdspace}}\n* {{Lurker|112|''Babylon 5: Thirdspace''}}\n\n{{Babylon 5}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Babylon 5 films|Thirdspace]]\n[[Category:1998 television films]]\n[[Category:1998 films]]\n[[Category:TNT Network original films]]\n[[Category:American science fiction action films]]\n[[Category:Films set in the 23rd century]]\n[[Category:American science fiction television films]]\n[[Category:Films based on television series]]\n[[Category:Television films based on television series]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Christopher Franke]]\n[[Category:1990s English-language films]]\n[[Category:1990s American films]]"}]}}}}
