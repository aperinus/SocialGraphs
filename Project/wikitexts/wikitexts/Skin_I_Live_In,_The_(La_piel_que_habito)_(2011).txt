It was also nominated for the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Foreign Language Film]] and 16 [[Goya Awards]].\n\n==Plot==\nPlastic surgeon Robert Ledgard was successful in cultivating an [[artificial skin]] resistant to burns and insect bites, which he calls \"GAL\", that he says he has been testing on [[athymic mice]]. He presents his results in a medical symposium but when he privately discloses he has also conducted illegal [[Transgenesis|transgenic]] experiments on humans, he is forbidden to continue with his research.\n\nOn his secluded estate, Ledgard is keeping a young woman named Vera captive, with the help of one of his servants, Marilia. Due to the suspension of his official experiments, Ledgard asks Marilia to dismiss the other servants.\n\nWhile Ledgard is out, Marilia's estranged son Zeca, having committed a robbery, arrives in a tiger costume and asks his mother to hide him for a few days. He sees Vera on Ledgard's security camera screens and demands to see her in person. When Marilia refuses to let him stay after she invites him in, he binds and gags her and then rapes Vera. Ledgard arrives and kills Zeca.\n\nWhile Ledgard disposes of Zeca's body, Marilia tells Vera that she (Marilia) is the mother of both Zeca and Ledgard by different men, a fact she has not shared with them. Ledgard was adopted by Marilia's employers, but was ultimately raised by her. Zeca later left to live in the streets and smuggle drugs, while Ledgard went to medical school and married a woman named Gal. When Zeca returned years later, he and Gal ran off together. They were involved in a terrible car crash in which Gal was badly burnt. Zeca had left the scene assuming her to be dead, while Ledgard had taken her from the car (in the present, Zeca had mistaken Vera for Gal, something she did not deny). Thereafter she lived in total darkness without any mirrors. One day, while hearing her daughter Norma singing in the garden, Gal accidentally sees her own reflection in the window; traumatized by the sight, she jumps to her death.\n\nIn the present, Ledgard returns and spends the night with Vera. During the night, he dreams of his past, specifically the night of a wedding six years earlier, where he finds Norma (his daughter) unconscious on the ground. Norma, who had been taking medication for psychosis\u2014having been rendered mentally unstable due to witnessing her mother's suicide\u2014comes to believe that Ledgard had raped her upon awakening with him above her; she subsequently develops a fear of all men and spends years in a mental health facility. She eventually kills herself in the same manner that her mother did.\n\nVera, too, dreams about the same event: Vicente, a young man who works in his mother's dress shop, crashes the wedding and meets Norma. Like others at the party, he is under the influence of drugs. He walks with Norma into the garden. She lists the psychiatric medications she has taken. Norma begins to take off some of her clothes, stating she would be naked all the time if she could. Vicente kisses her and compliments her. While they are lying down with Vicente on top of her, she suddenly starts to have a [[Posttraumatic stress disorder|frantic reaction]] to the music playing\u2014the same song she was singing when her mother committed suicide\u2014and starts screaming. Vicente attempts to hush her screams, leading to her biting his hand. He slaps her, knocking her unconscious. He rearranges her clothes and flees the scene, looking around nervously for potential witnesses, just before Ledgard arrives; he is unaware that Ledgard notices him leaving on his motorbike.\n\nLedgard tracks down Vicente and while in disguise, knocks Vicente off his motorbike, kidnaps him, and holds him in captivity. Vicente's mother reports his disappearance to the police, but after they find his motorbike at the bottom of a cliff, they tell her he is likely dead and has been swept out to sea. Although she believes her son is still alive, her search for him remains unsolved. Meanwhile, Ledgard subjects him to a [[vaginoplasty]] and later instructs him how to slowly stretch his new vagina. Over a period of six years, Ledgard physically transforms Vicente into a replica of his late wife, and renames him Vera. During this period of time, Vicente struggles to keep himself sane and cling to the core of his true identity.\n\nAfter an absence of four years, Marilia returns to work in Ledgard's house to look after Vera (Vicente). Vera reveals to Marilia that he has been held captive for the last six years.\n\nBack in the present, Ledgard's new relationship with Vera dismays Marilia, who does not trust Vera. Fulgencio, one of Ledgard's colleagues, reads a news story about the missing Vicente and recognizes him as one of their sex change patients. He accuses Ledgard of falsifying Vicente's consent and of experimenting on him. Vera, who overhears their conversation, tells Fulgenico that he is the missing Vicente and in support of Ledgard, states that he is here by his own free will. After Fulgenico leaves, Vera notices a photograph of himself as Vicente attached to the news story about missing persons. During the night, Ledgard and Vera start having sex, but Vera tells him that it is still painful after Zeca's rape. Ostensibly going downstairs to find lubricant, Vera retrieves Ledgard's gun and kills him. Marilia, alerted by the sound of the shot, barges into the bedroom with her own pistol in hand and finds her son Ledgard dead on the bed. Vera, who is hiding under the bed, shoots and kills Marilia. With her final breath, Marilia says \"I knew it.\"\n\nFreed from captivity at last, Vicente returns to his mother's dress shop for the first time since being kidnapped. Tearfully, he tells his lesbian ex-colleague Cristina (whom Vicente had loved six years prior) of his kidnapping, forced sex change, and the murders. As his mother enters the room, Vicente quietly reveals his identity to them in the final line of the film\u2014\"I am Vicente.\"\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Antonio Banderas]] as Dr. Robert Ledgard\n* [[Elena Anaya]] as Vera Cruz / Gal Ledgard\n* [[Marisa Paredes]] as Marilia\n* [[Jan Cornet]] as Vicente Guill\u00e9n Pi\u00f1eiro\n* [[Roberto \u00c1lamo]] as Zeca\n* [[Blanca Su\u00e1rez]] as Norma Ledgard\n* [[Susi S\u00e1nchez]] as Vicente's mother\n* [[B\u00e1rbara Lennie]] as Cristina\n* [[Eduard Fern\u00e1ndez]] as Fulgencio\n* [[Concha Buika]] as wedding singer\n}}\n\n==Production==\n[[Pedro Almod\u00f3var]] read [[Thierry Jonquet]]'s ''[[Tarantula (novel)|Tarantula]]'' approximately ten years before the film premiered.

But like many lab experiments, this melodramatic hybrid makes for an unstable fusion. Only someone as talented as Almod\u00f3var could have mixed such elements without blowing up an entire movie.\" Honeycutt continued: \"The film's design, costumes and music, especially Alberto Iglesias' music, present a lushly beautiful setting, which is nonetheless a prison and house of horror. Almod\u00f3var pumps his movie full of deadly earnestness and heady emotions.\"<ref>{{cite web |last=Honeycutt |first=Kirk |date= 19 May 2011 |url= https://hollywoodreporter.com/review/skin-i-live-la-piel-190230 |title=The Skin I Live In (La Piel Que Habito): Cannes 2011 Review |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |access-date=2011-05-22}}</ref> David Gritten notes Almod\u00f3var \"reaches out tentatively into unexplored genre territory\u2014horror...Yet despite squirm-worthy moments ... the promise of horror gives way to Almod\u00f3var's broader, familiar preoccupations: identity, blood ties, disguises and genetic traits.\" According to Gritten, \"A list of the story's various elements\u2014[[date rape]], murder, secrets, lies, mystery parents, gender ambiguity, unbreakable emotional bonds\u2014confirms ''The Skin I Live In'' as essentially a [[melodrama]]. Yet Almod\u00f3var's story-telling is nowhere near as shrill as it once was: as a mature artist, he has refined his skills to a point where these [[soap-opera]] [[Trope (literature)|tropes]] assimilate smoothly into a complex whole....Typically for Almod\u00f3var, it all looks ravishing, thanks to production designer Antxon G\u00f3mez and cinematographer [[Jos\u00e9 Luis Alcaine]]. All three men have the gift of investing mundane objects with a unique sheen; here even surgical instruments, about to be used malevolently, assume a dreamy, otherworldly quality.

Vera's plight and the temporal shifts help create an air of unease and barely controlled chaos, an unsettling vibe that becomes spooky when Ledgard puts on a white lab coat and begins doing strange things with blood....There are times in ''The Skin I Live In'' when it feels as if the whole thing will fly into pieces, as complication is piled onto complication, and new characters and intrigues are introduced amid horror, melodrama and slapstick.... [Yet] Mr. Almod\u00f3var's control remains virtuosic and the film hangs together completely, secured by Vera and Ledgard and a relationship that's a [[Pandora's box]] from which identity, gender, sex and desire spring.</blockquote>\n\n[[Dana Stevens (critic)|Dana Stevens]] noted it was Almod\u00f3var's \"first attempt to blend elements of the horror genre with the high-camp, gender-bending melodrama that's become his stock in trade\"; she called it \"visually lush and thematically ambitious\", a film that \"unfolds with a clinical chill we're unaccustomed to feeling in this director's films. ''The Skin I Live In'' is a math problem, not a poem. Still, what an elegant proof it is.\" Stevens called it a \"meditation on profound themes: memory, grief, violence, degradation, and survival\", a \"multigenerational melodrama [that] slowly fuse[s] into a coherent (if wackily improbable) whole\", offering  \"aesthetic and intellectual gratification, but little in the way of emotional punch.\"<ref>{{cite journal| url= http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/movies/2011/10/the_skin_i_live_in_reviewed_pedro_almod_var_s_new_film_.html | title= The Skin I Live In |date= 13 October 2011 | first= Dana |last= Stevens | author-link= Dana Stevens (critic) | journal= [[Slate (magazine)|Slate]] | access-date=2012-03-10}}</ref> [[The New Yorker]] ranked the film at No. 25 on their list of \"The 26 best films of 2011\".<ref>{{cite magazine|title=The 26 best films of 2011|url=https://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/the-26-best-films-of-2011/amp|magazine=The New Yorker|date=7 December 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Accolades==\nAnaya received the [[Goya Award for Best Actress]].
