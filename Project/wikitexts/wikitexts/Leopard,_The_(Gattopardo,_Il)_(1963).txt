It was a critical and commercial success in Europe, but reception was more lukewarm in the United States, where a truncated, English-dubbed cut was released. Retrospective reviews, drawn from the film's longer original cut, have been more positive, and the film is now widely regarded as a classic and one of the greatest movies ever made.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" />\n\n==Plot==\n\nIn [[Kingdom of the Two Sicilies|Sicily]] in the year 1860, Don Fabrizio Corbera, Prince of [[The Leopard#Locations|Salina]], enjoys the customary comforts and privileges of his ancestry. War has broken out between the armies of [[Francis II of the Two Sicilies]] and the insurgent volunteer [[Redshirts (Italy)|redshirts]] of [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]]. Among the rebels is the Prince's nephew, Tancredi, whose romantic politics the Prince hesitantly accepts with some whimsical sympathy. Upset by the uprising, the Prince departs to [[Palermo]]. [[Expedition of the Thousand|Garibaldi's army]] subjugate the city and expropriate Sicily from the [[House of Bourbon-Two Sicilies|Bourbons]]. The Prince muses upon the inevitability of change, with the middle class displacing the ruling class while on the surface everything remains the same. Refusing to bend to the tide of changes, the Prince departs to his summer palace at [[The Leopard#Locations|Donnafugata]].\n\nA new national assembly calls a [[Referendum|plebiscite]] and the nationalists win 512\u20130, thanks to the corruption and support of the town's leading citizen, Don Calogero Sedara. Don Calogero is invited to the villa of the Salinas, and he brings his daughter Angelica with him. Both the Prince and Tancredi are taken by Angelica's beauty. Soon thereafter, Tancredi makes plans to ask for her hand in marriage.\n\nThe Prince sees the wisdom of the match because he knows that, due to his nephew's vaulting ambition, Tancredi will be in need of ready cash, which Angelica's father will happily provide. With the blessing of both the Prince of Salina and Don Calogero, Tancredi and Angelica get engaged.\n\nA visitor from the constituent assembly comes to the villa. He pleads with the noblemen gathered there to join the senate and to guide the state; he hopes that the Prince's great compassion and wisdom will help alleviate the perceived poverty and alleged ignorance on the streets of Sicily. However, the Prince demurs and refuses this invitation, observing that Sicily prefers its traditions to the delusions of modernity because its people are proud of their ancient heritage. He sees a future where the leopards and the lions, along with the sheep and the jackals, will all live according to the same law, but he does not want to be a part of this democratic vision.\n\nHe notices that Tancredi has shifted allegiance from the insurgent Garibaldi to [[Victor Emmanuel II of Italy|King Vittorio]]'s newly-formed army, and wistfully judges that his nephew is the kind of opportunist and time-server who will flourish in the new Italy.\n\nA great ball is held at the villa of a neighbouring Prince which is attended by the Salinas including Tancredi. Afflicted by a combination of melancholia and the ridiculousness of the [[nouveau riche]], the Prince wanders forlornly from chamber to chamber, increasingly disaffected by the entire edifice of the society he so gallantly represents \u2013 until Angelica approaches and asks him to dance. Stirred and momentarily released from his cares, the Prince accepts, and once again he recaptures and presents the elegant and dashing figure of his past.\n\nHowever, he becomes disenchanted and leaves the ball alone.  He asks Tancredi to arrange carriages for his family, and walks with a heavy heart to a dark alley that symbolises Italy's inordinate and fading past which he inhabits.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Il gattopardo.jpg|thumb|left|From left-to-right, [[Claudia Cardinale]] as Angelica, [[Burt Lancaster]] as Don Fabrizio, and [[Alain Delon]] as Tancredi]]\n{{castlist|\n* [[Burt Lancaster]] as Don Fabrizio Corbera, Prince of Salina\n* [[Alain Delon]] as Prince Tancredi Falconeri, Don Fabrizio's nephew\n* [[Claudia Cardinale]] as Angelica Sedara / Bertiana\n* [[Paolo Stoppa]] as Don Calogero Sedara, Mayor of Donnafugata\n* [[Rina Morelli]] as Princess Maria Stella of Salina, Don Fabrizio's wife\n* [[Romolo Valli]] as Father Pirrone, chaplain of Salina\n* [[Terence Hill]] as Count Cavriaghi (credited as \"Mario Girotti\")\n* [[Serge Reggiani]] as Don Francisco \"Ciccio\" Tumeo\n* [[Leslie French]] as Cavalier Chevalley\n* [[Pierre Cl\u00e9menti]] as Francesco Paolo Corbera\n* [[Lucilla Morlacchi]] as Concetta Corbera\n* [[Ida Galli]] as Carolina Corbera\n* [[Ottavia Piccolo]] as Caterina Corbera\n* Carlo Valenzano as Paolo Corbera\n* Brook Fuller as Fabrizietto Corbera\n* [[Giuliano Gemma]] as [[Redshirts (Italy)|Redshirt]] General\n* [[Anna Maria Bottini]] as Mademoiselle Dombreuil, the governess\n* [[Marino Mas\u00e9]] as the Corberas' tutor\n* [[Lola Braccini]] as Donna Margherita\n* Howard Nelson Rubien as Don Diego\n* [[Olimpia Cavalli]] as Mariannina\n* [[Rina De Liguoro]] as Princess of Presicce\n* [[Ivo Garrani]] as Colonel Pallavicino\n* Franco Gul\u00e0 as Mimi\n}}\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Palazzo Gangi.jpg|right|thumb|150px|The ballroom of Palazzo Valguarnera-Gangi, where the famous ballroom sequence was shot]]\n\n===Development===\n[[File:Palermo, Villa Montalbo Boscogrande.jpg|left|thumb|Villa Boscogrande, one of the film's primary locations]]\n\nThe original novel had been a bestseller and won the [[Strega Prize]], Italy's most prestigious literary award.
