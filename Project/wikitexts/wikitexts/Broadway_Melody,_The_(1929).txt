It was one of the first musicals to feature a [[Technicolor]] sequence, which sparked the trend of color being used in a flurry of musicals that would hit the screens in 1929\u20131930.<ref>Richard W. Haines, list of first two-strip Technicolor (starting in 1928), in ''Technicolor Movies: The History of Dye Transfer Printing\" (Jefferson NC: McFarland, 2010), 15. {{ISBN|0786480750}}, 9780786480753</ref> Today, the Technicolor sequence survives only in black and white. The film was the first musical released by [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] and was Hollywood's first all-talking musical.\n\n''The Broadway Melody'' was written by Norman Houston and [[James Gleason]] from a story by [[Edmund Goulding]], and directed by [[Harry Beaumont]]. Original music was written by [[Arthur Freed]] and [[Nacio Herb Brown]], including the popular hit \"[[You Were Meant for Me (1929 song)|You Were Meant for Me]]\". The [[George M. Cohan]] classic \"[[Give My Regards to Broadway]]\" is used under the opening establishing shots of New York City, its film debut. Bessie Love was nominated for an [[Academy Award for Best Actress]] for her performance.\n\n== Plot ==\nEddie Kearns ([[Charles King (musical actor)|Charles King]]) sings \"The Broadway Melody\" and tells some chorus girls that he has brought the Mahoney Sisters [[vaudeville]] act to New York to perform it with him in the latest revue being produced by Francis Zanfield ([[Eddie Kane]]). Harriet \"Hank\" Mahoney ([[Bessie Love]]) and her sister Queenie Mahoney ([[Anita Page]]) are awaiting Eddie's arrival at their apartment. Hank, the older sister, prides herself on her business sense and talent, while Queenie is lauded for her beauty. Hank is confident they will make it big, while Queenie is less eager to put everything on the line to become a star. Hank declines the offer of their Uncle Jed ([[Jed Prouty]]) to join a 30-week traveling show but consents to think it over.\n\nEddie, who is engaged to Hank, arrives and sees Queenie for the first time since she was a girl and is instantly taken with her. He tells them to come to a rehearsal for Zanfield's revue to present their act. A blond woman sabotages their performance by placing a bag in the piano, which causes a fight with Hank. Zanfield isn't interested in it but says he might have a use for Queenie, who begs him to give Hank a part as well, saying both will work for one wage. She also convinces him to pretend that Hank's business skills won him over. Eddie witnesses this exchange and becomes even more enamored of Queenie for her devotion to her sister. During a dress rehearsal for the revue, Zanfield says the pacing is too slow for \"The Broadway Melody\" and cuts Hank and Queenie from the number.\n\nMeanwhile, another woman is injured after falling off a set prop, and Queenie is selected to replace her. Nearly everyone is captivated by Queenie, particularly notorious playboy Jacques \"Jock\" Warriner ([[Kenneth Thomson (actor)|Kenneth Thomson]]). While Jock begins to woo Queenie, Hank is upset that Queenie is building her success on her looks rather than her talent.\n\nOver the following weeks, Queenie spends a lot of time with Jock, of which Hank and Eddie fervently disapprove. They forbid her to see him, which results in Queenie pushing them away and deteriorating the relationship between the sisters. Queenie is only with Jock to fight her growing feelings for Eddie, but Hank thinks she's setting herself up to be hurt. Eventually, Eddie and Queenie confess their love for each other, but Queenie, unwilling to break her sister's heart, runs off to Jock once again.\n\nAfter witnessing Queenie's fierce outburst toward Eddie and his devastated reaction to it, Hank finally realizes that they are in love. She berates Eddie for letting Queenie run away and tells him to go after her. Hank claims to have never loved him and that she'd only been using him to advance her career. After he leaves, Hank breaks down and alternates between sobs and hysterical laughter. She composes herself enough to call Uncle Jed to accept the job with the 30-week show.\n\nThere's a raucous party at the apartment Jock had recently purchased for Queenie, but he insists they spend time alone. When she resists his advances, he says it's the least she could do after all he's done for her. He begins to get physical, but Eddie bursts in and attempts to fight Jock, who knocks him through the door with one punch. Queenie runs to Eddie and leaves Jock and the party behind.\n\nSometime later, Hank and Uncle Jed await the return of Queenie and Eddie from their honeymoon. The relationship between the sisters is on the mend, but there is obvious discomfort between Hank and Eddie. Queenie announces she's through with show business and will settle in their new house on [[Long Island, New York|Long Island]]. She insists that Hank live with them when her job is over. After Hank leaves with her new partner and Uncle Jed, Queenie laments that she couldn't help her sister find the happiness she deserves. Ironically, Hank's new partner is the blond who tried to sabotage the act when the sisters first arrived in New York. The final scene shows Hank on her way to the train station. She promises her new partner that they'll be back on Broadway within six months.<ref>Green, Stanley (1999) Hollywood Musicals Year by Year (2nd ed.), pub.

After the rushes were seen, the sets would often be changed to improve the recording qualities, and scenes would be re-shot, resulting in long days for the actors and an overall long shooting schedule.<ref name=\"csm\" /> It took over three hours to film Bessie Love's brief ukulele-playing scene.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Talkies: American Cinema's Transition to Sound, 1926\u20131931|first=Donald|last=Crafton|location=New York|publisher=Charles Scribner's Sons|date=1990|isbn=978-0-684-19585-8|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KFB_oT-jupQC&q=%22bessie+love%22+ukulele&pg=PA294|page=294|chapter=Three Seasons: The Films of 1928\u20131931}}</ref> For earlier takes, a full orchestra was just off-camera, but, for later takes, the actors sang and danced to prerecorded music.<ref name=\"csm\">{{cite news|title=A Broadway Melody Remembered|author-link=Bessie Love|first=Bessie|last=Love|date=June 27, 1969|newspaper=[[The Christian Science Monitor]]|page=8}}</ref>\n\nA [[silent film|silent]] version of the film was also produced,{{citation needed|date=July 2019}} as there were still many motion picture theaters without sound equipment at the time. The film featured a musical sequence for \"The Wedding of the Painted Doll\" that was presented in early two-color [[Technicolor]] (red and green filters). Color would quickly come to be associated with the musical genre, and numerous features were released in 1929 and 1930 that either featured color sequences or were filmed entirely in color, movies like ''[[On with the Show (1929 film)|On with the Show]]'' (1929), ''[[Gold Diggers of Broadway (film)|Gold Diggers of Broadway]]'' (1929), ''[[Sally (1929 film)|Sally]]'' (1929), ''[[The Life of the Party (1930 film)|The Life of the Party]]'' (1930), and others. The color footage is extant.\n\n== Reception and legacy ==\n[[File:Broadway Melody Ad.jpg|thumb|Ad for the film as seen in most magazine publications of the time.]]\n''The Broadway Melody'' was a substantial success and made a profit of $1.6 million for MGM.<ref name=\"Mannix\" /> It was the top grossing picture of 1929, and won the [[Academy Award for Best Picture]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Wierzbicki|first=James|title=Film Music: A History|year=2008|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-203-88447-8|page=116}}</ref>\n\nContemporary reviews from critics were generally positive. ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' wrote that it \"has everything a silent picture should have outside of its dialog. A basic story with some sense to it, action, excellent direction, laughs, a tear, a couple of great performances and plenty of sex.\"<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Silverman |first=Sid |date=February 13, 1929 |title=Broadway Melody |url=https://variety.com/1929/film/reviews/broadway-melody-1200410242/ |magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |location=New York |publisher=Variety, Inc. |page=13 |access-date=December 10, 2014 }}</ref> \"Has everything\", agreed ''[[Film Daily]]''. \"Sure-fire moneymaker that will drag 'em in everywhere.\"<ref>{{cite magazine |date=February 17, 1929 |title=Broadway Melody |magazine=[[Film Daily]] |location=New York |page=10 }}</ref>\n\n\"This picture is great.

Notwithstanding, it must be admitted that there are girls who talk as she is made to for the screen.

While the film was seen as innovation for its time and helped to usher in the concept and structure of musical films, the film has become regarded by contemporary critics as clich\u00e9-ridden and overly melodramatic.<ref>{{cite book|last=Levy|first=Emanuel|title=All about Oscar: The History and Politics of the Academy Awards|year=2003|publisher=Continuum|isbn=978-0-8264-1452-6|page=200}}</ref> It currently holds a rating of 42% at [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on 26 reviews, with a [[weighted arithmetic mean|weighted average]] of 5.3/10. The site's consensus is that the film \"is interesting as an example of an early Hollywood musical, but otherwise, it's essentially bereft of appeal for modern audiences\".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/broadway_melody/ |title=The Broadway Melody |website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |publisher=[[Fandango Media]] |access-date=September 2, 2022}}</ref> Assessing the film in 2009, [[James Berardinelli]] wrote, \"''The Broadway Melody'' has not stood the test of time in ways that many of its more artistic contemporaries have. Some of its deficiencies can be attributed to ways in which the genre has been re-shaped and improved over the years, but some are the result of the studio's validated belief that viewers would be willing to ignore bad acting and pedestrian directing in order to experience singing, dancing, and talking on the silver screen.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.reelviews.net/php_review_template.php?identifier=1848 |title=The Broadway Melody |last=Berardinelli |first=James |author-link=James Berardinelli |date=November 1, 2009 |website=Reelviews |publisher=James Berardinelli |access-date=December 10, 2014 }}</ref>\n\n== Sequels ==\nThree more movies were later made by MGM with similar titles, ''[[Broadway Melody of 1936]]'', ''[[Broadway Melody of 1938]]'', and ''[[Broadway Melody of 1940]]''. Although not direct sequels in the traditional sense, they all had the same basic premise of a group of people putting on a show (the films also had recurring cast members playing different roles, most notably dancer [[Eleanor Powell]] who appeared in all three).\n\nThe original movie was also remade in 1940 as ''[[Two Girls on Broadway]]''. Another ''Broadway Melody'' film was planned for 1943 (starring [[Gene Kelly]] and [[Eleanor Powell]]), but production was cancelled when Kelly was loaned to [[Columbia Pictures|Columbia]] for ''[[Cover Girl (film)|Cover Girl]]'' (1944).<ref name=\"rain\" /> ''[[Broadway Rhythm]]'', a 1944 musical by MGM, was originally to have been titled ''Broadway Melody of 1944''.\n\n== Awards and honors ==\n{{unreferenced section|date=February 2019}}\nAt the [[2nd Academy Awards]], ''The Broadway Melody'' won for [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]]. [[Harry Beaumont]] received a nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]] (lost to [[Frank Lloyd]] for ''[[The Divine Lady]]''), and [[Bessie Love]] was nominated for [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]] (lost to [[Mary Pickford]] for ''[[Coquette (film)|Coquette]]''). No nominations were announced prior to the 1930 ceremonies. Love and Beaumont are presumed to have been under consideration, and are listed as such by the [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]].\n\n== Home media ==\nIn 2005, ''The Broadway Melody'' was released on Region 1 special edition DVD by Warner Bros.
