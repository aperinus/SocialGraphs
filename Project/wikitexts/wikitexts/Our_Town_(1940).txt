The cast also included [[Fay Bainter]], [[Beulah Bondi]], [[Thomas Mitchell (actor)|Thomas Mitchell]], [[Guy Kibbee]]  and [[Frank Craven]]. It was adapted by [[Harry Chandlee]], Craven and Wilder, and directed by [[Sam Wood]].\n\nThe film was a faithful reproduction of the play except for two significant changes: the film used scenery, whereas the play had not; the events of the third act, which in the play revolve around the death of one of the main characters, were turned into a dream from which she awakens, allowing her to resume a normal life. Producer [[Sol Lesser]] worked with Wilder in creating these changes.\n\nWilder wrote producer Sol Lesser that \"Emily should live.... In a movie you see the people so close \"to\" that a different relation is established. In the theater, they are halfway abstractions in an allegory, in the movie they are very concrete.... It is disproportionately cruel that she die. Let her live....\"<ref>{{cite web |title=Our Town (notes) |url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/85941/our-town#notes |website=Turner Classic Movies |publisher=TCM |access-date=26 March 2021}}</ref>\n\nA radio adaptation of the film on ''[[Lux Radio Theater]]'' on May 6, 1940, used the altered film ending.\n\nThe U.S. copyright of the film was not renewed after its first term expired in 1968.{{Citation needed|date= July 2020}}\n\n==Plot==\nThe residents of the small town of Grover\u2019s Corners in New Hampshire live peacefully and in harmony. Dr. Gibbs, his wife Julie, and their two children George and Rebecca are the neighbors of the Webbs, who have a lovely daughter, Emily, and a younger son, Wally. George and Emily fall in love and after three years of courting they get married. Time goes by and Emily becomes very sick with the birth of her second child. While she is dying, she meets all the people who have left this world in the years before. Emily, who remains in a kind of in-between world, remembers her previous life, but in the end the young woman decides to live and she wakes up from her dream.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=24em}}\n* [[William Holden]] as George Gibbs\n* [[Martha Scott]] as Emily Webb\n* [[Fay Bainter]] as Mrs. Julia Gibbs\n* Dix Davis as Joe Crowell Jr.\n* [[Beulah Bondi]] as Mrs. Myrtle Webb\n* [[Thomas Mitchell (actor)|Thomas Mitchell]] as Dr. Frank F.

He explained, \"For the film version, they were counting on the music to translate the transcendental aspects of the story. I tried for clean and clear sounds and in general used straight-forward harmonies and rhythms that would project the serenity and sense of security of the story.\" Copland arranged about ten minutes from the film score for a suite. It is dedicated to [[Leonard Bernstein]].<ref name=\"Boosey & Hawkes\">{{cite web |url=https://www.boosey.com/cr/music/Aaron-Copland-Our-Town/2258 |title=Copland, Aaron Our Town (1940) Music from the film score |access-date=2018-11-19|work=Boosey.com}}</ref>\n\n==Awards==\nThe film was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Picture]].<ref name=\"NY Times\">{{cite web |url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/36778/Our-Town/details |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121017170350/http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/36778/Our-Town/details |url-status=dead |archive-date=2012-10-17 |department=Movies & TV Dept. |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=2012 |title=NY Times: Our Town |access-date=2008-12-13}}</ref> Scott, who reprised her stage role as Emily Webb, was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Actress]].
