Written and directed by [[Gavin Hood]], the film stars [[Asa Butterfield]] as [[Ender Wiggin|Andrew \"Ender\" Wiggin]], an unusually gifted child who is sent to an advanced military academy in space to prepare for a future [[alien invasion]]. The supporting cast includes [[Harrison Ford]], [[Hailee Steinfeld]], and [[Viola Davis]], with [[Abigail Breslin]] and [[Ben Kingsley]].\n\nThe film was released in Germany on October 24, 2013, followed by a release in the UK one day later.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.screendaily.com/box-office/gravity-stays-top-of-intl-on-38m/5062937.article?blocktitle=LATEST-FILM-NEWS&contentID=40562|title=Gravity stays top of int'l on $38m|website=ScreenDaily}}</ref> It was released in the United States, Canada, and several other countries on November 1, 2013, and was released in other territories by January 2014. ''Ender's Game'' received mixed reviews from critics and was a [[box-office bomb]], grossing only $125.5 million on a $110\u2013115 million budget.\n\n== Plot ==\nIn the future, humanity is preparing to launch an attack on the homeworld of an alien race, called the [[Formics]], that had attacked Earth and killed millions. The Formic invasion was stopped by Mazer Rackham, who crashed his fighter plane into the Formic queenship at the apparent cost of his life. Over the course of 50 years, gifted children are trained by the International Fleet to become commanders of a new fleet for this counterattack.\n\nCadet [[Andrew \"Ender\" Wiggin]] draws the attention of Colonel [[Hyrum Graff]] and Major Gwen Anderson because of his aptitude in simulated space combat and is recruited into Battle School.\n\nGraff brings Ender to Battle School and places Ender with other cadets his age, but treats him as extraordinary, thereby subjecting him to being ostracized by the others. The cadets are placed in squads and perform training games in a zero-gravity \"Battle Room\". Ender quickly adapts to the games, devising new [[Military strategy|strategies]] older students have not yet seen.\n\nGraff reassigns Ender to Salamander Army, led by Commander [[Bonzo Madrid]]. Bonzo, believing that Ender is inept and a liability, prevents him from training with the rest of the squad. Another cadet, [[Petra Arkanian]], takes Ender under her wing and trains him privately.  In the next match, Bonzo benches Ender while the rest of the Salamander Army fights another team. However, seeing the team losing and Petra in trouble, Ender comes to her aid and helps Salamander Army win.\n\nMeanwhile, Ender plays a computerized \"mind game\" set in a fantasy world, which presents difficult choices to the player. In one situation, Ender creates an [[outside the box]] solution to overcome a seemingly unsolvable problem. Later, he encounters a Formic in the game, and then simulated images involving his siblings. These are noted as unusual additions to the game, which is seemingly altered by Ender's interaction with the computer.\n\nGraff promotes Ender to lead his own squad, which is made up of students who have gained Ender's trust. They are put in increasingly difficult battles. In a surprise match against two other teams, including Bonzo's Salamander Army, Ender devises a novel strategy of sacrificing part of his team to achieve a goal, impressing Graff.\n\nBonzo attacks Ender in the bathroom after the match, but Ender fights back. Bonzo falls during the struggle and suffers a head injury. Distraught, Ender quits Battle School, but Graff has Ender's sister  [[Valentine Wiggin|Valentine]] convince him to continue.\n\nGraff takes Ender to humanity's forward base on a former Formic planet near their homeworld to meet with an elder Rackham.  Rackham explains that the Formics share a hive-mind mentality and how he exploited it to win the battle. Ender finds that his former squad members are also there to help him train in computerized simulations of large fleet combat; Rackham puts special emphasis on the fleet's Molecular Detachment (MD) Device that is capable of disintegrating matter.<ref group=\"note\">In the film, the MD Device stands for Molecular Detachment Device, whereas in the book, it has also been called the Molecular Disruption Device. In both instances, they are nicknamed the Little Doctor. {{cite book |url = https://archive.org/details/authorizedenderc0000blac |url-access = registration | title=The Authorized Ender Companion |last=Black |first=Jake |year=2009 |publisher=Tor Books |isbn=978-0-7653-2063-6 |access-date=2012-02-08 | page = [https://archive.org/details/authorizedenderc0000blac/page/368 368]}}</ref> Ender's training is rigorous, and Anderson expresses concern over this, but Graff notes they have run out of time to replace Ender.\n\nEnder's final test is monitored by several fleet commanders. As the [[Military simulation|simulation]] starts, Ender finds his fleet over the Formic homeworld, vastly outnumbered. He orders most of his fleet to sacrifice themselves to protect the MD long enough to fire on the homeworld. The resulting chain reaction burns over the surface of the planet, killing the entire population. The simulation ends, and Ender believes the test is over. The commanders restart the video screens, showing that Ender's fleet actually participated in live missions and destroyed the Formic homeworld.  Realizing he became a murderer for destroying the planet as well as feeling guilt for the Formics, Ender storms off only to be tranquilized by staff.\n\nWhile asleep, Ender is awoken by the Formic Queen and is directed to a Formic structure nearby as being similar to the ruined castle from the game. The Queen acknowledges Ender's role in the genocide and moves to kill him, but when Ender shows remorse, she spares his life. It is determined that the Formic were only seeking a source of water and did not want conflict. The Queen gives Ender a Queen egg that she has been protecting.\n\nWith the war ended, Ender is promoted to admiral, given a small ship, and left to his own devices. In a letter to Valentine, he confides that he is going into deep space, determined to start a new Formic colony with the Queen egg.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{further|List of Ender's Game characters}}\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Asa Butterfield]] as [[Ender Wiggin|Andrew \"Ender\" Wiggin]]<ref name=\"asacast\">{{cite news| url=https://variety.com/2011/film/news/asa-butterfield-locks-ender-s-game-1118046778/ | work=Variety|first=Jeff|last=Sneider|title=Asa Butterfield locks 'Ender's Game'|date=2011-11-29}}</ref>\n* [[Harrison Ford]] as [[Hyrum Graff|Colonel Hyrum Graff]]<ref name=\"Variety2011\">{{cite journal |url=https://variety.com/2011/film/news/harrison-ford-locked-for-ender-s-game-1118047827/ |title=Harrison Ford locked for ''Ender's Game'': OddLot's sci-fi tentpole gains trio of Oscar nominees |last=Sneider |first=Jeff |journal=Variety |date=December 21, 2011}}</ref>\n* [[Hailee Steinfeld]] as [[Petra Arkanian]]<ref name=\"firstshowing\">{{cite web |url=http://www.firstshowing.net/2011/harrison-ford-abigail-breslin-round-off-stellar-enders-game-cast/|title= Harrison Ford & Abigail Breslin round-off stellar ''Ender's Game'' cast}}</ref>\n* [[Viola Davis]] as [[List of Ender's Game characters#International Fleet personnel|Major Gwen Anderson]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theatermania.com/los-angeles/news/02-2012/viola-davis-joins-cast-of-enders-game-film_49459.html |title=Viola Davis Joins Cast of Ender's Game Film - Theater News - Feb 2, 2012 |publisher=Theatermania.com |date=2012-02-02 |access-date=2013-03-06}}</ref>\n* [[Ben Kingsley]] as [[Mazer Rackham]]<ref name=\"tgdaily.com\" />\n** Kyle Russell Clements as Young Mazer Rackham\n* [[Abigail Breslin]] as [[Valentine Wiggin]]<ref name=\"Variety2011\" />\n* [[Aramis Knight]] as [[Bean (Ender's Game)|Bean]]<ref name=\"Variety2011\" />\n* Suraj Parthasarathy as [[List of Battle School students#Alai|Alai]]<ref name=\"Variety2011\" />\n* [[Mois\u00e9s Arias]] as [[Bonzo Madrid|Bonzo]]<ref name=\"Variety2011\" />\n* [[Khylin Rhambo]] as [[Dink Meeker|Dink]]<ref name=\"Variety2011\" />\n* Conor Carroll as [[Bernard (character)|Bernard]]<ref name=\"Variety2011\" />\n* [[Nonso Anozie]] as Sergeant Dap<ref name=\"csmonitor.com\" />\n* [[Jimmy Pinchak]] as [[Peter Wiggin]]<ref name=\"Variety2011\" />\n* Stevie Ray Dallimore as [[John Paul Wiggin]]<ref name=\"csmonitor.com\">{{cite news|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/The-Culture/Culture-Cafe/2012/0221/Ender-s-Game-gains-three-new-cast-members |title='Ender's Game' gains three new cast members |newspaper=[[The Christian Science Monitor]] | last = Schaefer | first= Sandy |date=2012-02-21 |access-date=2013-03-06}}</ref>\n* Andrea Powell as [[Theresa Wiggin]]<ref name=\"csmonitor.com\" />\n* [[Brandon Soo Hoo]] as [[List of Battle School students#Fly Molo|Fly Molo]]<ref name=\"tgdaily.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.tgdaily.com/games-and-entertainment-features/61147-enders-game-is-on-track|title=Ender's Game is on track &#124; TG Daily|date=31 January 2012 |publisher=tgdaily.com|access-date=May 3, 2014}}</ref>\n* [[Orson Scott Card]] as Pilot (voice cameo)<ref name=\"AICN\">{{cite web|url=https://www.aintitcool.com/node/55810|title=So Orson Scott Card Visited The Set Of The Ender's Game Movie...|last=Oliver | first = Glen \"Merrick\"|date=May 17, 2012|work = Ain't It Cool News | access-date=May 18, 2012}}</ref>\n}}\n\n== Production ==\n\n=== Development ===\n{{quote box\n| width = 30em\n| bgcolor = transparent\n| align = right\n| quote = The first decision I made was not to pursue the [[Peter Wiggin|Peter]]\u2014[[Valentine Wiggin|Valentine]] subplot with the Internet, because that's just watching people type things into the computer. The second decision I made was to give that information about the surprise at the end from the start. In my script we know who Mazer Rackham really is and we know what is at stake as Ender plays his games. But Ender doesn't know, so I think the suspense is actually increased because the audience knows we're about the business of saving the world and that everything depends on this child not understanding that. We care all the more about whether he wins{{emdash}}and we worry that he might not want to. As we watch the adults struggle to get control of Ender, we pity him because of what's happening to him, but we want the adults to succeed.
