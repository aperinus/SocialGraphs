The film also features new live performances of several Motown [[hit single|hit songs]], with the Funk Brothers backing up [[Gerald Levert]], [[Meshell Ndegeocello|Me'shell Ndegeocello]], [[Joan Osborne]], [[Ben Harper]], [[Bootsy Collins]], [[Chaka Khan]], and [[Montell Jordan]].<ref name=\"Funk Brothers 1\"/>\n\nThe impetus behind making the film was to bring these influential players out of anonymity.

It was their sound, according to [[Mary Wilson (singer)|Mary Wilson]] (of [[The Supremes]]), that backed [[The Temptations]], [[The Supremes]], [[The Miracles]], the [[Four Tops]], [[Gladys Knight & the Pips]], [[Marvin Gaye]], [[Stevie Wonder]], and [[Mary Wells]], among other noteworthy bands during their tenure from 1959 to 1973.<ref name=\"USA today Funk Brothers\">{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/music/news/2002-11-28-funk-brothers_x.htm|title=Motown's Funk Brothers cast long 'Shadows'|last=Jones|first=Steve|date=November 28, 2002|publisher=USA Today|access-date=February 21, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303231945/https://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/music/news/2002-11-28-funk-brothers_x.htm|archive-date=March 3, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n== Soundtrack album ==\n{{Album ratings\n| rev1 = [[Allmusic]]\n| rev1Score = {{Rating|4|5}}<ref name=\"stand-am-review\">{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/standing-in-the-shadows-of-motown-original-soundtrack-mw0000225387|title=AllMusic: Standing in the Shadows of Motown [Original Soundtrack] \u2013 review|author=William Ruhlmann|publisher=AllMusic|access-date=December 9, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171105185734/https://www.allmusic.com/album/standing-in-the-shadows-of-motown-original-soundtrack-mw0000225387|archive-date=November 5, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n}}\nReleased by [[Hip-O Records]].\n# \"[[(Love Is Like a) Heat Wave]]\" \u2013 [[Joan Osborne]]\n# \"[[You've Really Got a Hold on Me]]\" \u2013 [[Meshell Ndegeocello]]\n# \"[[Do You Love Me]]\" \u2013 [[Bootsy Collins]]\n# \"[[Bernadette (Four Tops song)|Bernadette]]\" \u2013 [[The Funk Brothers]]\n# \"[[Reach Out I'll Be There]]\" \u2013 [[Gerald Levert]]\n# \"[[Ain't Too Proud to Beg]]\" -
