Jackie reprises his \"Kevin\" [[Chan Ka-Kui]] character, a [[Hong Kong Police Force|Hong Kong cop]] from ''[[Police Story (1985 film)|Police Story]]'' and ''[[Police Story 2]]''. It is the third installment of the [[Police Story (film series)|''Police Story'' series]], as well as first in ''Police Story'' franchise not to be directed by Jackie, with [[Stanley Tong]] taking over the helm. It is also the last appearance in the series for [[Maggie Cheung]] as Jackie's girlfriend, May.<ref>{{cite news|title= Supercop Gets Kicks From Footloose Style |work=The Los Angeles Times|date=26 July 1996|url= http://articles.latimes.com/1996-07-26/entertainment/ca-27970_1_jackie-chan|access-date=23 October 2010|first=Kevin|last=Thomas}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nKa-Kui is the \"supercop\" of the [[Hong Kong]] police with amazing martial arts skills. He is sent to [[Guangzhou]], where the Chinese police force's Interpol director, Inspector Jessica Yang ([[Michelle Yeoh]]), briefs him on his next assignment. The target is Chaibat, a drug lord based in Hong Kong. To infiltrate Chaibat's organization, Ka-Kui is to get close to Chaibat's henchman Panther, who is in a Chinese prison. Ka-Kui, posing as a petty criminal prisoner, manages Panther's escape with the connivance of the guards. Grateful, Panther invites Ka-Kui to go with him to Hong Kong and join Chaibat's gang. Panther meets up with some of his other men, and vouches for Ka-Kui. The group heads for Hong Kong.\n\nOn the way, they pass through Ka-Kui's supposed home village, and Panther insists that Ka-Kui visit his family there. He does not actually know anyone in the village, but is pleasantly relieved to be greeted by undercover police posing as his family, with Yang as his sister. The local police pretend to arrest Ka-Kui in a restaurant, but Ka-Kui and Yang (also a martial-arts expert) escape after a big fight, which concludes with the faked killing of a policeman. This confirms Panther's trust in them.\n\nIn Hong Kong, Chaibat welcomes Ka-Kui and Yang to his luxurious hide-out. He takes them with him to a big opium grower's fortified compound in the [[Golden Triangle (Southeast Asia)|Golden Triangle military camp]] of [[Thailand]], for a meeting of big-time heroin traffickers. During the meeting, Chaibat's gang attack from outside while Ka-Kui and Yang protect him inside. In a huge gun battle, Chaibat's gang kill the rival traffickers and their guards, and smash up the compound. The grower survives, but will now sell only to Chaibat at Chaibat's price.\n\nThe action then shifts to [[Kuala Lumpur]], [[Malaysia]], where Chaibat's wife, Chen Wen-Shi, is in prison, facing the death penalty for an unspecified crime. Chaibat needs to get her out of prison, because only she knows the secret codes to his [[Banking in Switzerland|Swiss bank account]], and will not reveal them to him unless freed. Chaibat brings his gang, now including Ka-Kui and Yang, to Kuala Lumpur to stage a jailbreak.\n\nA new difficulty arises when Ka-Kui sees his girlfriend May, a tour guide, in Kuala Lumpur leading a party of Hong Kong tourists. He has told her he's on assignment. Ka-Kui evades May at first, but she sees him at the luxurious hotel where Chaibat's gang are staying, with the beautiful Yang, and confronts him in a jealous rage. This nearly blows Ka-Kui's cover, but Panther is persuaded that May is angry because Ka-Kui tried to proposition her as a prostitute. Later, Ka-Kui gets May alone and explains the situation, and she finally calms down. At one point, May even manages to keep Ka-Kui from inadvertently blowing his own cover. But then, in an elevator, May tells a co-worker about Ka-Kui, and is overheard by one of Panther's men. Chaibat takes May hostage, and forces Ka-Kui and Yang \u2013 their cover now blown \u2013 to help free Chen.\n\nChaibat's scheme is successful and May is released, as per their agreement. However, the exchange turns sour when Chaibat pushes May from his helicopter, though she survives. Furious, Ka-Kui and Yang pursue Chaibat and his men over the roads, rooftops (where Ka-Kui and Yang defeat Panther and his partner), and skies of Kuala Lumpur. In the climax on top of a speeding train, Chaibat is killed after his helicopter collides with a bridge and lands on him. Yang and Ka-Kui also recapture Chen. Since her husband is dead, she decides to tell Yang and Ka-Kui the password to Chaibat's bank account. The two partners argue whether Hong Kong or China will get the money.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Jackie Chan]] as [[Royal Hong Kong Police|RHKP]] Inspector \"Kevin\" [[Chan Ka-Kui]] / Chen Chia-Chu / Lin Fu Sheng\n* [[Michelle Yeoh]] (billed as \"Michelle Khan\") as [[Interpol (organization)|Interpol]] Inspector based in Beijing \"Jessica\" Yang Chien-Hua / Hannah Lin\n* [[Maggie Cheung]] as May, Kevin's girlfriend\n* [[Bill Tung]] as \"Uncle\" Bill Wong, RHKP Senior Superintendent and Kevin's immediate superior\n* [[Philip Chan (actor)|Philip Chan]] as Chief Superintendent of Police (Hong Kong) RHKP Chief Superintendent Y.K.

Interior scenes were shot in [[Kuala Lumpur]].\n\nAccording to his book ''I Am Jackie Chan: My Life in Action'', Chan dislocated his cheekbone during a stunt scene.<ref name=\"I Am Jackie Chan\">{{cite web |url=http://www.randomhouse.com/features/iamjackiechan/excerpt_aches.html |title=Jackie's Aches and Pains: It Only Hurts When I'm Not Laughing |author=Jackie Chan |author-link=Jackie Chan |publisher=[[Random House]] |access-date=19 December 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Filming locations===\n*[[Victoria Harbour]], [[Central and Western District]], [[Hong Kong Island]], [[British Hong Kong]]\n*[[Nanjing Road (Shanghai)|Nanjing Road]] and [[The Bund (Shanghai)|The Bund]], [[Shanghai]], [[People's Republic of China]]\n*[[Sultan Abdul Samad Building]], [[Kuala Lumpur Railway Station]], [[Kuala Lumpur]], [[Klang Valley]], [[Peninsular Malaysia]], [[Malaysia]]\n*[[Brisbane]], [[Queensland]], [[Australia]]\n\n===Dimension version===\nThe [[Dimension Films]] version, which was distributed theatrically in North America in 1996, was dubbed into [[American English]] with the participation of [[Jackie Chan]] and [[Michelle Yeoh]].\n\nAmong the changes was the addition of a new score composed and conducted by composer [[Joel McNeely]]. [[Tom Jones (singer)|Tom Jones]]' rendition of \"[[Kung Fu Fighting]]\" plays over the end credits, followed by a song specially written and performed for the film by the band [[Devo]], entitled \"Supercop\".\n\nThis release was cut by approximately 10 minutes. These cuts include:\n* Scenes of the police superiors getting a briefing about drug-related crimes.\n* The police superiors discussing a plan to send Jackie Chan's character on an undercover mission.\n* A scene where Yeoh tries to teach Chan about Mainland China.\n* A longer version of the meeting with Chaibat in which the sexy women lounging about his mansion are revealed as drug addicts.\n\n==Home media==\nThe film was given a theatrical and [[VHS]] release in the United Kingdom.\n\n===DVD and Blu-ray releases===\n* In January 1998, [[Dimension Films]] released their ''Supercop'' version.\n* In Hong Kong, the film was initially released by Mega Star Video Distribution (Megastar), and later Deltamac.

All Hong Kong DVDs contain the original cut.\n* In January 2009, the film was re-released in the west by [[Dragon Dynasty]] and [[the Weinstein Company]]. Although it has the original [[Hong Kong Cantonese]] soundtrack, it is cut to fit the visuals of the included Dimension ''Supercop'' version.

Connoisseurs will find Chan's helicopter-train chase far riskier, more exciting and more believable than its mates in ''[[Mission: Impossible (film)|Mission: Impossible]]'' and ''[[The Living Daylights]]''\".<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/style/longterm/review96/supercopharr.htm | work=The Washington Post | title=More Kicks From Jackie Chan | date=18 March 1997}}</ref>\n\nFurthermore, in 2009, director [[Quentin Tarantino]] named ''Police Story 3'' as one of his favorite films of the past seventeen years.<ref>{{cite web|title=Quentin Tarantino's Top 20 Films of the Past 17 Years|url=http://www.filmjunk.com/2009/08/17/quentin-tarantinos-top-20-films-of-the-past-17-years/|access-date=28 June 2013}}</ref> He said that ''Supercop'' features the \"greatest stunts ever filmed in any movie ever\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comcast.net/slideshow/entertainment-tarantinotop20/17/ |title=Quentin Tarantino's Top 20 Favorite Films |access-date=5 September 2009}}</ref> In 2016 during a roundtable discussion, when asked which movie scene he would love to save for the last of humanity to see, he named the final scene of the movie as his choice.<ref>{{cite web|title=TheHollywoodReporter Roundtable Interview With Directors|website = [[YouTube]]|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ7qKKQrSBY|access-date=4 January 2016}}</ref>\nIn 2014, ''[[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out]]'' polled several film critics, directors, actors and stunt actors to list their top action films.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.timeout.com/newyork/film/best-action-movies|work=[[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out]]|title=The 100 best action movies|access-date=7 November 2014}}</ref> ''Supercop'' was listed at 75th place on this list.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.timeout.com/newyork/film/the-100-best-action-movies-80-71 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141116140621/www.timeout.com/newyork/film/the-100-best-action-movies-80-71 |archive-date=2014-11-16 |work=Time Out|access-date=7 November 2014|title=The 100 best action movies: 80-71}}</ref>\n\n==Spin-off==\n{{Main|Supercop 2}}\nMichelle Yeoh went on to star in a 1993 [[spin-off (media)|spin-off]] called ''[[Supercop 2]]'' or ''Project S''.

The game's last mission, \"End of the Line\", in which C.J must chase a firetruck with a red open-top car and catch Sean \"Sweet\" Johnson, was taken from the scene in which Jackie must chase a van using a red open-top car to catch Jessica Yang (Michelle Yeoh).\n\nThe mission \"Wrong Side of the Tracks\", in which the player must follow a train from a dirt bike, was taken from the scene in which Jessica Yang (Michelle Yeoh) follows the train on a similar dirt bike.\n\nThe film briefly appears in a scene in British police comedy film ''[[Hot Fuzz]]'' in which Danny Butterman sees the film in a supermarket's bargain bin and reads it while Nicholas Angel pursues a shoplifter.\n\n==Music==\n{{main|Supercop (soundtrack)}}\nTwo songs \"I Have My Way\" (\u6211\u6709\u6211\u8def\u5411) sung by Jackie Chan and \"I Just Want You to Understand\" (\u6211\u53ea\u60f3\u4f60\u61c2) sung by Taiwanese musician [[Jonathan Lee (musician)|Jonathan Lee]], both lyricized by Hong Kong songwriter [[James Wong Jim|James Wong]] and composed by Lee,<ref>{{cite book |date=February 2016 |first=Zhu |last=Wang  |url=https://www.google.com/books/edition/%E5%94%B1%E6%88%91%E9%80%8D%E9%81%A5%E8%B0%83_%E9%BB%84%E9%9C%91%E7%9A%84%E6%AD%8C%E5%BD%B1%E6%B1%9F%E6%B9%96/RkRyDwAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1&dq=%22%E6%88%91%E6%9C%89%E6%88%91%E8%B7%AF%E5%90%91%22&pg=PT34&printsec=frontcover&bsq=%22%E6%88%91%E6%9C%89%E6%88%91%E8%B7%AF%E5%90%91%22 |script-title=zh:\u5531\u6211\u900d\u9059\u8abf:\u9ec3\u9711\u7684\u6b4c\u5f71\u6c5f\u6e56 |publisher=Guizho Publishing (\u8d35\u5dde\u4eba\u6c11\u51fa\u7248\u793e) |isbn=978-7-221-12800-3 }}</ref> are featured as theme songs for the Asian versions of the film.\n\nA soundtrack containing alternative rock and hip hop song was released on 30 July 1996 by [[Interscope Records]].
