J. Soles]] and [[Nancy Kyes]] in supporting roles. The plot centers on a mental patient, [[Michael Myers (Halloween)|Michael Myers]], who was committed to a [[Sanatorium|sanitarium]] for [[Sororicide|murdering his babysitting teenage sister]] on [[Halloween]] night when he was six years old. Fifteen years later, he escapes and returns to his hometown, where he stalks a female babysitter and her friends while under pursuit by his psychiatrist.\n\nFilming took place in Southern California in May 1978. The film premiered in October, whereupon it grossed $70 million, becoming one of the most profitable independent films of all time. Primarily praised for Carpenter's direction and [[Halloween (soundtrack)|score]], many critics credit the film as the first in a long line of slasher films inspired by [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' (1960) and [[Bob Clark]]'s ''[[Black Christmas (1974 film)|Black Christmas]]'' (1974). It is considered one of [[List of films considered the best|the greatest and most influential horror films ever made]].

A [[Halloween II (1981 film)|direct sequel]] of the film was released in 1981. A [[Halloween (2007 film)|remake]] was released in 2007, which was followed by a [[Halloween II (2009 film)|sequel]] in 2009. An [[Halloween (2018 film)|eleventh installment]], which serves as a direct sequel to the original film that [[retcon]]s all previous sequels, was released in 2018; this was followed by two direct sequels: ''[[Halloween Kills]]'' (2021) and ''[[Halloween Ends]]'' (2022). Additionally, a novelization, a video game and comic book series have been based on the film.\n\n==Plot== \nOn [[Halloween]] night in 1963, in the fictional suburban town of Haddonfield, Illinois, six-year-old [[Michael Myers (Halloween)|Michael Myers]] stabs his teenage sister Judith to death with a [[chef's knife]]. For fifteen years Michael is incarcerated at Smith's Grove [[Mental hospital|Sanitarium]], during which time he never speaks a word. On October 30, 1978, Michael's psychiatrist, [[Samuel Loomis|Dr. Samuel Loomis]], arrives at the sanitarium to escort Michael to court for a hearing; Loomis hopes that Michael will be locked up for life. Michael escapes Smith's Grove, killing a mechanic for his [[boilersuit|coveralls]] on the way back to Haddonfield. Upon arriving, he steals knives, ropes, and a white, expressionless mask from a hardware store.\n\nOn Halloween, Michael sees high school student [[Laurie Strode]] drop off a key at the long-abandoned Myers house that her father is trying to sell. Laurie notices Michael stalking her throughout the day but her friends [[Annie Brackett]] and [[List of Halloween (franchise) characters|Lynda Van der Klok]] dismiss her concerns. Loomis arrives in Haddonfield and finds Judith's tombstone missing from the cemetery. He meets with Annie's father, Sheriff Leigh Brackett, and they investigate Michael's house, where Loomis tells Brackett that in the 15 years he's known Michael, he's realized that he is pure evil. Brackett is doubtful of the danger but goes to patrol the streets, while Loomis waits at the house, expecting Michael to return. That night, Laurie babysits Tommy Doyle, while Annie babysits Lindsey Wallace across the street.\n\nMichael follows them, spying on Annie and killing the Wallaces' dog. Tommy sees Michael from the windows and thinks he is the [[boogeyman]], but Laurie does not believe him. Annie later takes Lindsey over to the Doyle house to spend the night so she can pick up her boyfriend Paul. When she gets into her car, Michael appears from the back seat, strangling her and slitting her throat. Soon after, Lynda and her boyfriend Bob arrive at the Wallace house and find it empty. After having sex, Bob goes downstairs to get a beer, where Michael kills him by pinning him to the wall with a kitchen knife. Michael then poses as Bob in a ghost costume and confronts Lynda, who teases him to no effect. Annoyed, she calls Laurie to find out what happened to Annie, but Michael strangles her to death with the phone cord while Laurie listens on the other end, thinking it is a joke.\n\nLoomis discovers the stolen car and searches the streets. Suspicious of the phone call, Laurie goes to the Wallace house and finds her friends' bodies, as well as Judith's headstone, in the upstairs bedroom. She flees to the hallway, where Michael appears in the dark and slashes her arm, causing her to fall over the stairway banister. Laurie narrowly escapes and runs back to the Doyle house, but finds she lost the keys to the front door during the altercation with Michael. Tommy lets her into the house. Laurie orders Tommy and Lindsey to hide and tries to use the telephone for help, only to find the phone dead.\n\nMichael sneaks in through the window and attacks her again, but she incapacitates him by stabbing him in the neck with a knitting needle. Thinking he is dead, Laurie staggers upstairs to check on the children, but is shocked when Michael approaches to attack her again. She tells the children to hide in the bathroom while Laurie hides in the bedroom closet, but Michael finds her. Laurie pokes his eye out with a coat hanger, causing Michael to drop the knife, which Laurie uses to stab him in the chest. She then tells Tommy and Lindsey to go down the street to a neighbor's house to call the police. After they leave, Michael awakens once again and slowly approaches an unsuspecting Laurie. Loomis sees the kids running from the house and goes to investigate, only to see Michael attempting to strangle Laurie.\n\nLaurie snatches Michael\u2019s mask off, distracting him as he seeks to put it back on. Loomis shoots Michael once in the head and five more times in the chest, knocking him off the balcony. Laurie asks Loomis if Michael was the \"boogeyman\", which Loomis confirms. Loomis walks to the balcony and looks down to see that Michael has vanished. Unsurprised, he stares off into the night as Laurie sobs.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{main|List of Halloween (franchise) characters|l1=List of ''Halloween'' characters}}\n{{castlist|\n* [[Donald Pleasence]] as [[Samuel Loomis|Dr. Sam Loomis]]\n* [[Jamie Lee Curtis]] as [[Laurie Strode]]\n* [[Nick Castle]] as [[Michael Myers (Halloween)|Michael Myers / The Shape]]\n** [[Will Sandin]] as Michael Myers (age 6)\n* [[P.

As also stated in the 2009 documentary ''Clarkworld'' (written and directed by Clark's former production designer Deren Abram after Clark's tragic death in 2007), Carpenter directly asked Clark about his thoughts on developing the anonymous slasher in ''Black Christmas'': \n{{blockquote|... I did a film about three years later, started a film with John Carpenter, it was his first film for [[Warner Bros.]] (which picked up ''Black Christmas''), he asked me if I was ever gonna do a sequel and I said no. I was through with horror, I didn't come into the business to do just horror. He said, 'Well what would you do if you did do a sequel?' I said it would be the next year and the guy would have actually been caught, escape from a mental institution, go back to the house and they would start all over again. And I would call it ''Halloween''. The truth is John didn't copy ''Black Christmas'', he wrote a script, directed the script, did the casting. ''Halloween'' is his movie and besides, the script came to him already titled anyway. He liked ''Black Christmas'' and may have been influenced by it, but in no way did John Carpenter copy the idea. Fifteen other people at that time had thought to do a movie called ''Halloween'' but the script came to John with that title on it.\n\n|author = Bob Clark\n|source = 2005 interview, ''Icons of Fright''<ref name=\"IconsOfFright\" />}}\n\n===Screenplay===\nIt took approximately 10 days to write the screenplay.{{sfn|Muir|2012|p=13}} Yablans and Akkad ceded most of the creative control to writers Carpenter and Hill (whom Carpenter wanted as producer), but Yablans did offer several suggestions. According to a ''Fangoria'' interview with Hill, \"Yablans wanted the script written like a radio show, with 'boos' every 10 minutes.\"<ref name=\"behind\" /> By Hill's recollection, the script took three weeks to write,{{sfn|Smith|2003|loc=event occurs at 9:30}} and much of the inspiration behind the plot came from [[Celtic polytheism|Celtic]] traditions of Halloween such as the festival of [[Samhain]]. Although Samhain is not mentioned in the plot of the first film, Hill asserts that:\n\n{{blockquote|... the idea was that you couldn't kill evil, and that was how we came about the story. We went back to the old idea of Samhain, that Halloween was the night where all the souls are let out to wreak havoc on the living, and then came up with the story about the most evil kid who ever lived.

Clover]] has argued that the film, and its genre at large, links sexuality with danger, saying that killers in slasher films are fueled by a \"psychosexual fury\"{{sfn|Clover|1987|p=194}} and that all the killings are sexual in nature. She reinforces this idea by saying that \"guns have no place in slasher films\" and when examining the film ''[[I Spit on Your Grave]]'' she notes that \"a hands-on killing answers a hands-on rape in a way that a shooting, even a shooting preceded by a humiliation, does not.\"{{sfn|Clover|1987|p=198}} Equating sex with violence is important in ''Halloween'' and the slasher genre according to film scholar Pat Gill, who made a note of this in her essay \"The Monstrous Years: Teens, Slasher Films, and the Family\". She remarks that Laurie's friends \"think of their babysitting jobs as opportunities to share drinks and beds with their boyfriends. One by one they are killed ... by Michael Myers an asylum escapee who years ago at the age of six murdered his sister for preferring sex to taking care of him.\"{{sfn|Gill|2002|p=22}} Carpenter has distanced himself from these interpretations, saying \"It has been suggested that I was making some kind of moral statement. Believe me, I'm not. In ''Halloween'', I viewed the characters as simply normal teenagers.\"<ref name=\"scifi1\" /> In another interview, Carpenter said that readings of the film as a [[morality play]] \"completely missed the point,\" adding, \"The one girl who is the most sexually uptight just keeps stabbing this guy with a long knife. She's the most sexually frustrated. She's the one that's killed him. Not because she's a virgin but because all that sexually repressed energy starts coming out. She uses all those phallic symbols on the guy.\"{{sfn|Jones|2005|p=102}}\n\nSome feminist critics, according to historian Nicholas Rogers, \"have seen the slasher movies since ''Halloween'' as debasing women in as decisive a manner as hard-core pornography.\"{{sfn|Rogers|2002|pages=117\u2013118}} Critics such as [[John Kenneth Muir]] state that female characters such as Laurie Strode survive not because of \"any good planning\" or their own resourcefulness, but sheer luck. Although she manages to repel the killer several times, in the end, Strode is rescued in ''Halloween'' and ''Halloween II'' only when Dr. Loomis arrives to shoot Myers.{{sfn|Muir|1998|p=104}} However, Clover has argued that despite the violence against women, ''Halloween'' and other slasher films turned women into heroines.{{sfn|Clover|1993|p=46}} In many pre-''Halloween'' horror films, women are depicted as helpless victims and are not safe until they are rescued by a strong masculine hero. Despite the fact that Loomis saves Strode, Clover asserts that ''Halloween'' initiates the role of the \"[[final girl]]\" who ultimately triumphs in the end. Strode fights back against Myers and severely wounds him.{{sfn|Clover|1993|pages=25\u201333}} Had Myers been a normal man, Strode's attacks would have killed him; even Loomis, the male hero of the story, who shoots Michael repeatedly with a revolver, cannot kill him.{{sfn|Clover|1993|p=189}} Aviva Briefel argued that moments such as when Michael's face was temporarily revealed are meant to give pleasure to the male viewer. Briefel further argues that these moments are masochistic in nature and give pleasure to men because they are willingly submitting themselves to the women of the film; they submit themselves temporarily because it will make their return to authority even more powerful.{{sfn|Briefel|2005|pages=17\u201318}} Critics, such as Gill, see ''Halloween'' as a critique of American social values. She remarks that parental figures are almost entirely absent throughout the film, noting that when Laurie is attacked by Michael while babysitting, \"No parents, either of the teenagers or of the children left in their charge, call to check on their children or arrive to keen over them.\"{{sfn|Gill|2002|p=22}}\n\nAccording to Gill, the dangers of [[suburbia]] is another major theme that runs throughout the film and the slasher genre at large: Gill states that slasher films \"seem to mock [[white flight]] to [[gated communities]], in particular the attempts of parents to shield their children from the dangerous influences represented by the city.\"{{sfn|Gill|2002|p=16}} ''Halloween'' and slasher films, generally, represent the underside of suburbia to Gill.{{sfn|Gill|2002|pages=15\u201317}} Myers was raised in a suburban household and after he escapes the mental hospital he returns to his hometown to kill again; Myers is a product of the suburban environment, writes Gill.{{sfn|Gill|2002|p=16}}\n\nMichael is thought by some to represent evil in the film. This is based on the common belief that evil never dies, nor does evil show any remorse. This idea is demonstrated in the film when Dr. Loomis discusses Michael's history with the sheriff. Loomis states, \"I spent eight years trying to reach him [Michael Myers], and then another seven trying to keep him locked up because I realized that what was living behind that boy's eyes was purely and simply ... evil.\" Loomis also refers to Michael as \"evil\" when he steals his car at the sanitarium.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.popmatters.com/166315-reel-terror-by-david-konow-2495792142.html|title='Reel Terror' Is Quite the Hatchet Job|date=2012-12-19|work=PopMatters|access-date=2018-10-05|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181005113353/https://www.popmatters.com/166315-reel-terror-by-david-konow-2495792142.html|archive-date=October 5, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Aesthetic elements===\n[[File:Halloween_opening_scene.jpg|thumb|alt=A man and woman embracing on a couch|Judith Myers and her boyfriend, as viewed from the point-of-view of young Michael Myers; this voyeuristic perspective is a distinguishing feature of the film's opening scene]]\nHistorian Nicholas Rogers notes that film critics contend that Carpenter's direction and camera work made ''Halloween'' a \"resounding success.\"{{sfn|Rogers|2002|p=111}} [[Roger Ebert]] remarks, \"It's easy to create violence on the screen, but it's hard to do it well.

The camera slowly moves toward the jack-o'-lantern's left eye as the main title theme plays. After the camera fully closes in, the jack-o'-lantern's light dims and goes out. Film historian J.P. Telotte says that this scene \"clearly announces that [the film's] primary concern will be with the way in which we see ourselves and others and the consequences that often attend our usual manner of perception.\"{{sfn|Telotte|1992|p=116}} Carpenter's first-person point-of-view compositions were employed with [[steadicam]]; Telotte argues, \"As a result of this shift in perspective from a disembodied, narrative camera to an actual character's eye ... we are forced into a deeper sense of participation in the ensuing action.\"{{sfn|Telotte|1992|pages=116\u2013117}} Along with the 1974 Canadian horror film ''[[Black Christmas (1974 film)|Black Christmas]]'', ''Halloween'' made use of seeing events through the killer's eyes.{{sfn|Muir|2011|p=315}}\n\nThe first scene of the young Michael's voyeurism is followed by the murder of Judith seen through the eye holes of Michael's clown costume mask. According to scholar Nicholas Rogers, Carpenter's \"frequent use of the unmounted first-person camera to represent the killer's point of view ... invited [viewers] to adopt the murderer's assaultive gaze and to hear his heavy breathing and plodding footsteps as he stalked his prey.\"{{sfn|Rogers|2002|p=111}} Film analysts have noted its delayed or withheld representations of violence, characterized as the \"false startle\" or \"the old tap-on-the-shoulder routine\" in which the stalkers, murderers, or monsters \"lunge into our field of vision or creep up on a person.\"{{sfn|Diffrient|2004|p=61}} Critic Susan Stark described the film's opening sequence in her 1978 review:\n\n{{blockquote|In a single, wonderfully fluid tracking shot, the camera establishes the quiet character of a suburban street, the sexual hanky-panky going on between a teenage couple in one of the staid-looking homes, the departure of the boyfriend, a hand in the kitchen drawer removing a butcher's knife, the view on the way upstairs from behind the eye-slits of a Halloween mask, the murder of a half-nude young girl seated at her dressing table, the descent downstairs and whammo! The killer stands speechless on the lawn, holding the bloody knife, a small boy in a satin clown suit with a newly-returned parent on each side shrieking in an attempt to find out what the spectacle means.<ref name=\"stark\" />}}\n\n==Legacy==\n''Halloween'' is a widely influential film within the horror genre; it was largely responsible for the popularization of slasher films in the 1980s and helped develop the slasher genre. ''Halloween'' popularized many tropes that have become completely synonymous with the slasher genre. ''Halloween'' helped to popularize the [[final girl]] [[Trope (literature)|trope]], the killing off of characters who are substance abusers or sexually promiscuous,{{sfn|Williams|1996|pages=164\u2013165}} and the use of a theme song for the killer. Carpenter also shot many scenes from the perspective of the killer in order to build tension. These elements have become so established that many historians argue that ''Halloween'' is responsible for the new wave of horror that emerged during the 1980s.{{sfn|Clover|1993|p=24}}{{sfn|Conrich|2004|p=92}} Due to its popularity, ''Halloween'' became a blueprint for success that many other horror films, such as ''[[Friday the 13th (franchise)|Friday the 13th]]'' and ''[[A Nightmare on Elm Street (franchise)|A Nightmare on Elm Street]]'', followed, and that others like ''[[Scream (1996 film)|Scream]]'' satirized.{{citation needed|date=October 2021}}\n\nThe major themes present in ''Halloween'' also became common in the slasher films it inspired. Film scholar Pat Gill notes that in ''Halloween'', there is a theme of absentee parents{{sfn|Gill|2002|p=22}} but films such as ''A Nightmare on Elm Street'' and ''Friday the 13th'' feature the parents becoming directly responsible for the creation of the killer.{{sfn|Gill|2002|p=26}}\n\nThere are slasher films that predated ''Halloween'', such as ''[[Silent Night, Bloody Night]]'' (1972),  ''[[The Texas Chain Saw Massacre]]'' (1974) and ''[[Black Christmas (1974 film)|Black Christmas]]'' (1974) which contained prominent elements of the slasher genre; both involving a group of teenagers being murdered by a stranger as well as having the final girl trope. ''Halloween'', however, is considered by historians as being responsible for the new wave of horror films, because it not only used these tropes but also pioneered many others.{{sfn|Clover|1993|p=24}}{{sfn|Conrich|2004|p=92}} Rockoff notes that it is \"difficult to overestimate the importance of ''Halloween'',\" noting its pioneering use of the final girl character, subjective point-of-view shots, and holiday setting.{{sfn|Rockoff|2011|p=55}} Rockoff considers the film \"the blueprint for all slashers and the model against which all subsequent films are judged.\"{{sfn|Rockoff|2011|p=55}}\n\n==Related works==\n===Novelization and video game===\nA [[mass market paperback]] novelization [[Halloween (novel)|of the same name]], written by Curtis Richards (a pseudonym that was used by author Richard Curtis), was published by Bantam Books in 1979. It was reissued in 1982.<ref>{{cite book|last=Richard|first=Curtis|title=Halloween|publisher=Bantam Books|year=1982|orig-year=1979|location=New York|isbn=978-0-553-26296-4}}</ref> it later went out of print. The novelization adds aspects not featured in the film, such as the origins of the curse of Samhain and Michael Myers' life in Smith's Grove Sanatorium, which contradict its source material. For example, the novel's version of Michael speaks during his time at the sanitarium;<ref>{{cite book|last=Richard|first=Curtis|title=Halloween|publisher=Bantam Books|year=1979|location=New York|isbn=978-0-553-13226-7}}</ref> in the film, Dr. Loomis states, \"He hasn't spoken a word in fifteen years.\"\n\nIn 1983, ''[[Halloween (video game)|Halloween]]'' was adapted as a video game for the [[Atari 2600]] by [[Wizard Video]].{{sfn|Perron|2009|p=5}} None of the main characters in the game were named.
