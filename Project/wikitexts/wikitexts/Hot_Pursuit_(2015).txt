Following an incident in which the mayor's son yells \"[[riding shotgun#Modern usage|Shotgun!]]\", setting him on fire by [[tasing]] him while he carried an alcoholic drink, Cooper's ineptness in the field has her assigned to the evidence locker.\n\nCooper's commanding officer, Captain Emmett, gives her a secret assignment to join Deputy US Marshal Jackson, protecting Felipe Riva and his wife Daniella. Riva must testify against cartel leader Vicente Cortez. At the Riva home, a pair of masked assassins and a different pair of assassins kill Jackson and Felipe while Cooper and Daniella are upstairs. Daniella grabs one suitcase, containing many pairs of shoes, and the women flee in Riva's car. When Daniella later tries to run off, Cooper handcuffs herself to her.\n\nThey are found by Cooper's fellow officers Dixon and Hauser. Cooper realizes the officers are one of the assassin teams when she sees the longhorn tatoo, so they escape and head for Dallas, where Daniella can testify against Cortez.\n\nThe women learn Cooper is now labelled a fugitive fleeing with Daniella. A tractor trailer plows into the car, spraying hidden [[cocaine]] everywhere. Cooper gets the truck driver to drop them at a store, where Daniella and the very high Cooper change their clothes. When the assassins show up, they stow away in a horse trailer hooked to a pickup truck. When the truck stops Cooper tries to steal it, but the owner, Red, reappears with a gun. She and Daniella flee, find another pickup, and drive away.\n\nThe ladies continue bonding, with Cooper admitting her rigid, by-the-books nature has made it difficult to meet a man. They are surprised to find a man named Randy sleeping in the back of the pickup. He is a felon with an ankle bracelet for viciously assaulting his sisters' abusive boyfriends. Cooper agrees to take off the bracelet in exchange for Randy's help. Daniella is pleased to see Randy flirting with Cooper.\n\nDaniella explains her bag of shoes are covered with $4 million in real diamonds, revealing Cortez's [[money laundering]] method. When Dixon and Hauser appear and shoot at them, Randy attacks Hauser, allowing the women to run.\n\nThe women hitch a ride on a tour bus, until Dixon and Hauser catch up to them on the road. Taking the wheel, they shoot back at the crooked cops, and end up running the men off the road. After they succeed, Daniella knocks out Cooper in a single punch.\n\nCooper wakes up and sees Daniela talking to the assassins who were also chasing them. We discover she is working with the assassins to murder Cortez as revenge for killing her brother. Additionally, she was not going to testify in Dallas, but instead hired the men to 'kidnap' her before she was escorted out of her house. She leaves Cooper, going with the men to take down Vincente Cortez.\n\nSoon after, Cooper is cleared of any wrongdoing after explaining what happened. Captain Emmett advises her to let the FBI take care of Cortez, but she ignores him.\n\nSneaking into Cortez's daughter's [[Quincea\u00f1era]] as a man to get close to Daniella, she tries to get her to wear a wire to get Cortez' confession to her brother's murder. A woman walking into the bathroom mistakes Cooper for a pervert and throws her out. Getting back into the party, running into Emmett, she learns he is working for Cortez. He pulls a gun on her, but Cooper pours alcohol on him and tases him so he catches fire.\n\nDaniella corners Cortez and reveals her intentions to kill him. Cooper arrives and stops her, but when he draws a gun Cooper shoots him dead.\n\nThree months later, Daniella is released from prison, and Cooper picks her up and transports her out.  She surprises Daniella with her old pairs of very valuable shoes.  She also reveals that Randy is in the car with her, and Daniella likes Cooper's new \"wild side\", as they drive off together.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Reese Witherspoon]] as Officer Rose Cooper\n* [[Sof\u00eda Vergara]] as Daniella Riva\n* [[Robert Kazinsky]] as Randy\n* [[Matthew Del Negro]] as Detective Hauser\n* [[Michael Mosley (actor)|Michael Mosley]] as Detective Dixon\n* [[Richard T.
