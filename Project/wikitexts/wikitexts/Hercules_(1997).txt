The 35th [[List of Disney theatrical animated feature films|Disney animated feature film]] and the eighth animated film produced during the [[Disney Renaissance]], the film was directed by [[Ron Clements]] and [[John Musker]]. The film is loosely based on the legendary hero [[Heracles]] (known in the film by his [[Roman mythology|Roman]] name, [[Hercules]]), the son of [[Zeus]], in [[Greek mythology]]. It features the voices of [[Tate Donovan]], [[Danny DeVito]], [[James Woods]], and [[Susan Egan]]. In the film's story, [[Hercules (Disney character)|Hercules]], a demigod with super-strength raised among mortals, must learn to become a true hero in order to earn back his godhood and place in Mount Olympus, while his evil uncle Hades plots his downfall.\n\nDevelopment of ''Hercules'' began in 1992 following a pitch adaptation of the Heracles mythological stories by animator Joe Haidar. Meanwhile, Clements and Musker re-developed their idea for ''[[Treasure Planet]]'' (2002) following the critical and commercial success of ''[[Aladdin (1992 Disney film)|Aladdin]]'' (1992). Their project was removed from development in 1993, and Musker and Clements joined ''Hercules'' later that same year. Following an unused treatment by Haidar, Clements and Musker studied multiple interpretations of Greek mythology before abandoning [[Zeus]]'s adulterous affair with [[Alcmene]]. The project underwent multiple story treatments and a first script draft was inspired by the [[screwball comedy]] films of the [[Classical Hollywood cinema|classic Hollywood era]] and popular culture of the 1990s. Donald McEnery, Bob Shaw, and [[Irene Mecchi]] were brought on board to revise the script. British cartoonist [[Gerald Scarfe]] was recruited as production designer and produced over seven hundred visualization designs of the characters. Research trips to [[Greece]] and [[Turkey]] provided inspiration for the background designs. Animation for the film was done in California and Paris. [[Computer animation]] was used in several scenes, predominantly in the Hydra battle sequence.\n\n''Hercules'' was released on June 13, 1997 and received generally positive reviews from film critics, with James Woods's performance as Hades receiving particular praise, but the animation (particularly the visual style) and music received a mixed response. The film under-performed in its theatrical release notably in comparison to previous animated Disney films, ultimately earning $252.7&nbsp;million in box office revenue worldwide.<ref name=Mojo/> ''Hercules'' was later followed by the direct-to-video prequel ''[[Hercules: Zero to Hero]]'' (1999), which served as the pilot to ''[[Hercules (1998 TV series)|Hercules: The Animated Series]]'', a syndicated Disney television series focusing on Hercules during his time at the Prometheus Academy.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, the plot summary should be 400-700 words. -->\nIn [[Ancient Greece]], the gods [[Zeus]] and [[Hera]] have a son named [[Hercules (Disney character)|Hercules]]. While the other gods are joyful, Zeus' wicked brother [[Hades (Disney)|Hades]] plots to overthrow Zeus and rule [[Mount Olympus]]. Through [[List of Disney's Hercules characters#Other Greek myths|the Fates]], Hades learns that in eighteen years, a [[planetary alignment]] will allow him to free the [[Titans]] to conquer Olympus, but only if Hercules does not interfere. Hades sends his imp minions, [[Pain and Panic]], to murder Hercules, providing them with a potion that can strip a god of immortality. The two kidnap the baby, take him down to the valley and feed him the potion. However, before Hercules drinks the last drop, two farmers pass nearby and startle the demons, causing them to drop the bottle. Hercules is stripped of immortality but retains his god-like strength. Pain and Panic attempt to murder the baby, but Hercules easily overpowers them. The pair decide not to report their failure to Hades.\n\nYears later, the teenage Hercules becomes an outcast for his inability to control his strength. Wondering about his origins, he decides to visit the [[Temple of Zeus, Olympia|Temple of Zeus]] for answers. Once there, a [[statue of Zeus]] comes to life and reveals all to Hercules, telling him that he can earn back his godhood by becoming a \"true hero.\" Zeus sends Hercules and his forgotten childhood friend [[List of Disney's Hercules characters#Pegasus|Pegasus]] to the [[satyr]] [[List of Disney's Hercules characters#Phil|Philoctetes]] (\"Phil\") who is known for training heroes. Phil has retired in frustration after none of his past students managed to earn a constellation in the sky. Zeus obliges Phil to train Hercules anyway. After completing the training, Phil and Hercules head towards [[Ancient Thebes (Boeotia)|Thebes]]. On the way, they meet [[Megara (Disney character)|Megara]] (\"Meg\"), a sarcastic damsel whom Hercules saves from the centaur [[Nessus (mythology)|Nessus]]. Unbeknownst to Hercules, Meg is Hades' slave and was actually trying to recruit Nessus. She had sold her soul to Hades previously to save a lover who then left her. When Meg mentions what happened, Hades realizes that Pain and Panic failed him and plots to finish off Hercules properly.\n\nArriving in Thebes, Hercules is met with skepticism by the locals, but then Meg appears, saying that two boys are trapped under a large rock in a gorge. Hercules lifts the rock and rescues the boys, unaware that they are Pain and Panic in disguise, and unwittingly releases the [[Lernaean Hydra|Hydra]]. Much to Hades's chagrin, Hercules defeats the monster and becomes a celebrated hero. Hercules defeats many other monsters, many of which are sent by Hades, and his popularity and fortune grow. However, Zeus tells him that he is not yet a \"true\" hero and refuses to explain what that means. Saddened and frustrated, Hercules spends a day out with Meg, who starts to fall in love with him. Hades learns of this, and on the eve of his takeover, he holds Meg hostage and offers her freedom in exchange for Hercules surrendering his powers for a day. On the condition that Meg will be unharmed, Hercules accepts and is heartbroken after learning that Meg was working for Hades all along.\n\nHades unleashes the Titans, who climb Olympus and defeat the gods, while the [[Cyclopes|Cyclops]] goes to Thebes to kill Hercules. Hercules uses his wits to defeat the Cyclops. Unfortunately, during the battle, Meg is mortally injured. This breaks Hades's promise that Meg would not be harmed, so Hercules regains his strength. Hercules and Pegasus fly to Olympus, free the gods and vanquish the Titans, but Meg dies before he can return to her.\n\nTo recover Meg's soul, Hercules goes to the [[Greek underworld|underworld]] and leaps into the [[River Styx]]. This act would be fatal for a mortal, but his willingness to sacrifice himself is a sufficiently heroic act to restore his godhood. Hercules survives, saves Meg's soul and knocks Hades into the Styx. After reviving Meg, she and Hercules are summoned to Olympus, where Zeus and Hera welcome their son home, saying that he has proved himself a \"true hero\" through the \"strength of his heart.\" However, rather than join the gods there, Hercules chooses to remain on Earth with Meg. The heroes then return to Thebes, where they watch Zeus form [[Hercules (constellation)|a constellation]] in Hercules' honor.\n\n==Voice cast==\n{{See also|List of Disney's Hercules characters}}\n\n* [[Tate Donovan]] as [[Hercules (Disney character)|Hercules]], based on the [[Greek mythology|mythological]] [[deity]] [[Heracles]].

He went on to say that the hardest part in animating Hades was that he talks too much and too fast, so much so that \"it took [him] two weeks to animate a one-second scene\".
