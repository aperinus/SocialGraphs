[[Colin Firth]] plays the future [[George VI|King George VI]] who, to cope with a [[stammer]], sees [[Lionel Logue]], an Australian [[speech and language therapist]] played by [[Geoffrey Rush]]. The men become friends as they work together, and after [[Edward VIII abdication crisis|his brother abdicates the throne]], the new king relies on Logue to help him make his first wartime radio broadcast upon [[United Kingdom declaration of war on Germany (1939)|Britain's declaration of war on Germany]] in 1939.\n\nSeidler read about George VI's life after learning to manage a stuttering condition he developed during his own youth. He started writing about the relationship between the therapist and his royal patient as early as the 1980s, but at the request of the King's widow, [[Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother]], postponed work until her death in 2002. He later rewrote his screenplay for the stage to focus on the essential relationship between the two protagonists. Nine weeks before filming began, the filmmakers learned of the existence of notes written by Logue that were being used by his grandson Mark and [[Peter Conradi]] as the basis of a [[The King's Speech: How One Man Saved the British Monarchy|book]], and were granted permission to incorporate material from the notes and book into the script.\n\n[[Principal photography]] took place in London and around Britain from November 2009 to January 2010. [[Hard and soft light|Hard light]] was used to give the story a greater resonance and wider-than-normal lenses were employed to recreate the Duke of York's feelings of constriction. A third technique Hooper employed was the off-centre [[Framing (visual arts)|framing]] of characters.\n\n''The King's Speech'' was a major [[#Box office|box office]] and [[#Critical response|critical success]]. It was widely praised by film critics for its visual style, art direction, screenplay, directing, score, and acting. Other commentators discussed the film's representation of historical detail, especially the reversal of [[Winston Churchill]]'s opposition to abdication. The film received many [[List of awards and nominations received by The King's Speech|awards and nominations]], particularly for Colin Firth's performance, which resulted in his first [[Academy Award for Best Actor]]. At the [[83rd Academy Awards]], ''The King's Speech'' received 12 Oscar nominations, more than any other film in that year, and subsequently won four, including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]]. Censors initially gave it adult ratings due to profanity, though these were later revised downwards after criticism by the makers and distributors in the UK and some instances of swearing were muted in the US. On a budget of \u00a38&nbsp;million, it earned over \u00a3250&nbsp;million internationally.<ref>{{As of|2011|8|21}} all US Dollar-Sterling currency conversions were made using an exchange rate of $1=\u00a30.60</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nAt the official closing of the [[British Empire Exhibition]] at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]], [[Prince Albert, Duke of York]], the second son of [[King George V]], addresses the crowd with a strong [[Stuttering|stammer]]. His search for treatment has been discouraging, but his wife, [[Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother|Elizabeth]], persuades him to see the [[Australia]]n-born [[Lionel Logue]], a non-medically trained [[Harley Street]] [[speech defects therapist]]. \"Bertie\", as he is called by his family, believes the first session is not going well, but Lionel, who insists that all his patients address him as such, has his potential client recite [[Hamlet]]'s \"[[To be, or not to be]]\" soliloquy while hearing classical music played on a pair of headphones. Bertie is frustrated at the experiment but Lionel gives him the [[acetate recording]] that he has made of the reading as a souvenir.\nAfter Bertie's father, King George V, broadcasts his 1934 [[Royal Christmas Message]], he explains to Bertie that the wireless will play a significant part in the role of the royal family, allowing them to enter the homes of the people, and that Bertie's brother's neglect of his responsibilities make training in it necessary. The attempt at reading the message himself is a failure, but that night Bertie plays the recording Lionel gave him and is astonished at the lack of stutter there. He therefore returns for daily treatments to overcome the physical and psychological roots of his speaking difficulty.\n\nGeorge V dies in 1936, and his eldest son David ascends the throne as [[King Edward VIII]]. A constitutional crisis arises with the new king over a prospective marriage with the twice-divorced American socialite [[Wallis Simpson]]. Edward, as the [[supreme governor of the Church of England]], cannot marry her, even if she receives her second divorce, since both her previous husbands are alive.\n\nAt an unscheduled session, Bertie expresses his frustration that, while his speech has improved when speaking to most people, he still stammers when talking to David, at the same time revealing the extent of Edward VIII's folly with Simpson. When Lionel insists that Bertie himself could make a good king, Bertie accuses Lionel of speaking [[High treason in the United Kingdom|treason]] and quits Lionel in anger. Bertie must now face the [[Accession Council]] without any assistance.\n\nBertie and Lionel only come together again after [[Edward VIII abdication crisis|King Edward decides to abdicate]] in order to marry. Bertie, urged ahead by Prime Minister [[Stanley Baldwin]], ascends the throne as King George VI and visits Lionel's home with his wife before their [[coronation of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth|coronation]], much to the surprise of Mrs. Logue when she comes upon Queen Elizabeth having tea at her dining room table. This is the first time that she learns who her husband's patient has been.\n\nBertie and Lionel's relationship is questioned by the King's advisors during the preparations for his coronation in [[Westminster Abbey]]. The [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], [[Cosmo Gordon Lang]], brings to light that George never asked for advice from his advisors about his treatment and that Lionel has never had formal training.  Lionel explains to an outraged Bertie that at the time he started with speech defects there were no formal qualifications and that the only known help that was available for returning [[Great War]] [[shell-shock]]ed Australian soldiers was from personal experience. Bertie remains unconvinced until provoked to protest at Lionel's disrespect for [[King Edward's Chair]] and the [[Stone of Scone]]. Only at this pivotal moment, after realising he has just expressed himself without impairment, is Bertie able to rehearse with Lionel and complete the ceremony.\n\nAs the new king, Bertie is in a crisis when he must broadcast to Britain and the [[British Empire|Empire]] following the [[United Kingdom declaration of war on Germany (1939)|declaration of war on Nazi Germany]] in 1939. Lionel is summoned to [[Buckingham Palace]] to prepare the king for his speech. Knowing the challenge that lies before him, Lang, [[Winston Churchill]], and Prime Minister [[Neville Chamberlain]] are present to offer support. The King and Logue are then left in the broadcasting room. He delivers his speech with Logue conducting him, but by the end he is speaking freely. Preparing to leave the room for the congratulations of those present, Logue mentions to the King that he still has difficulty enunciating ''w'' and the King jokes back, \"I had to throw in a few so they'd know it was me.\"\n\nAs the Royal Family step onto the palace balcony and are applauded by the crowd, a [[title card]] explains that Logue, who received the [[Royal Victorian Order]] for service to the Crown, was always present at King George VI's speeches during the war and that they remained friends until the King's death from [[lung cancer]] in 1952.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Colin Firth and Helena Bonham Carter filming.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|Colin Firth and Helena Bonham Carter as the Duke and Duchess of York]]\n\n* [[Colin Firth]] as [[King George VI]]\n* [[Geoffrey Rush]] as [[Lionel Logue]]\n* [[Helena Bonham Carter]] as [[Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother|Queen Elizabeth]]\n* [[Guy Pearce]] as [[King Edward VIII]]\n* [[Timothy Spall]] as [[Winston Churchill]]\n* [[Derek Jacobi]] as [[Cosmo Gordon Lang]]\n* [[Jennifer Ehle]] as [[Lionel Logue#Personal life|Myrtle Logue]]\n* [[Michael Gambon]] as [[King George V]]\n* [[Freya Wilson]] as [[Elizabeth II|Princess Elizabeth]]\n* [[Ramona Marquez]] as [[Princess Margaret]]\n* [[Patrick Ryecart]] as [[Clive Wigram, 1st Baron Wigram|Lord Wigram]]\n* [[Simon Chandler]] as [[Bertrand Dawson, 1st Viscount Dawson of Penn|Lord Dawson of Penn]]\n* [[Claire Bloom]] as [[Mary of Teck|Queen Mary]]\n* [[Orlando Wells]] as [[Prince George, Duke of Kent]]\n* [[Eve Best]] as [[Wallis Simpson]]\n* [[Anthony Andrews]] as [[Stanley Baldwin]]\n* [[Andrew Havill]] as Robert Wood\n\n==Production==\n\n===Development===\n\nAs a child, [[David Seidler]] developed a stammer, which he believes was caused by the emotional trauma of [[World War II]] and the murder of his grandparents during [[the Holocaust]]. King George VI's success in overcoming his stammer inspired the young Seidler, \"Here was a stutterer who was a king and had to give radio speeches where everyone was listening to every syllable he uttered, and yet did so with passion and intensity.\" When Seidler became an adult, he resolved to write about King George VI. During the late 1970s and 1980s he voraciously researched the King, but found a dearth of information on Logue. Eventually Seidler contacted Valentine Logue, who agreed to discuss his father and make his notebooks available if the Queen Mother gave her permission. She asked him not to do so in her lifetime, and Seidler halted the project.<ref>{{Citation|title=Colin Firth and \"The King's Speech|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHTZWMr0xn8 |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211220/aHTZWMr0xn8 |archive-date=2021-12-20 |url-status=live|language=en|access-date=2021-03-10}}{{cbignore}}</ref>\n\n[[File:GeoffreyRushTIFFSept2011.jpg|thumb|upright|left|The film's producers broke etiquette by hand-delivering [[Geoffrey Rush]] the script.

Three years later, Seidler returned to the story during a bout of creative work inspired by a recovery from cancer. His research, including a chance encounter with an uncle whom Logue had treated, indicated he used mechanical breathing exercises combined with psychological counselling to probe the underlying causes of the condition. Thus prepared, Seidler imagined the sessions. He showed the finished screenplay to his wife, who liked it, but pronounced it too \"seduced by cinematic technique\". She suggested he rewrite it as a stage play to focus on the essential relationship between the King and Logue. After he had completed it, he sent it to a few friends who worked in theatre in London and New York for feedback.{{citation needed|date=December 2019}}\n\nIn 2005, Joan Lane of Wilde Thyme, a production company in London, received the script. Lane started talking with Simon Egan and Gareth Unwin of [[Bedlam Productions]], and they invited Seidler to London to rewrite the play again, this time for the screen. Together, Lane and Bedlam Productions organised a reading of the play in [[Pleasance Islington|Pleasance Theatre]], a small house in north London, to a group of Australian expatriates, among whom was [[Tom Hooper]]'s mother. She called her son and said, \"I've found your next project\".<ref name=Gritten>Gritten, D. (23 December 2010).

At the London Film Festival, Hooper criticised the decision, questioning how the board could certify the film \"15\" for bad language but allow films such as ''[[Salt (2010 film)|Salt]]'' (2010) and ''[[Casino Royale (2006 film)|Casino Royale]]'' (2006) to have \"12A\" ratings, despite their graphic torture scenes.
