The film stars [[Brian Krause]], [[M\u00e4dchen Amick]] and [[Alice Krige]]. The film revolves around the last two survivors of a vampiric shapeshifting species that feed on the life force of human female virgins. It was the first time King wrote a screenplay intended for the screen first, rather than adapting one of his already-existing novels or stories.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, the plot summary should be 400-700 words. -->\nCharles Brady and his mother/lover Mary are sleepwalkers, nomadic [[shapeshifting]] [[Psychic vampire|energy vampire]]s who feed off the lifeforce of virgin women. Though they normally maintain a human form, they can transform into human-sized [[bipedal]] [[werecat]]s, their natural form, at will. They have powers of both [[telekinesis]] and [[illusion]]. [[Cat|Domestic cats]] are their only weakness, and the two species are mutually hostile. Cats see through their illusions and violently attack them, inflicting severe to fatal wounds on them with their claws and teeth.\n\nCharles and Mary live in Travis, a small Indiana town, having recently fled [[Bodega Bay, California]] after draining and killing a young girl there. Charles attends the local high school, and meets [[Tanya Robertson]] in his creative writing class. Charles feigns romantic interest in Tanya in order to take her lifeforce for himself and his starving mother. Their teacher, Mr. Fallows, is suspicious about Charles and tells him that his older high school certificates were fakes; he also physically assaults Charles, but Charles kills him.\n\nOn their first date, at a picnic at a nearby cemetery, Charles attempts to drain Tanya's lifeforce while kissing her. Tanya tries frantically to ward off Charles by bashing his head with her camera, scratching his face, and plunging a corkscrew into his left eye, though nothing she does seems to cause Charles more than temporary discomfort.\n\nDeputy Sheriff Andy Simpson is driving by the cemetery. When Tanya flees to him for help, Charles kills Simpson. When Charles resumes feeding off Tanya, the deputy's cat, Clovis, enraged by his master\u2019s death, violently scratches him in the face and chest. Mortally wounded, Charles staggers back home to his mother, who is able to make both of them invisible, and thus keep Charles from being arrested when the police storm their house. Clovis and a small number of other cats begin to gather outside, only kept at bay by the [[Trapping#Trap types|leghold traps]] the Sleepwalkers have set.\n\nKnowing that the only way for her dying son to survive is to feed, Mary attacks the Robertson household, killing several deputies and state troopers and severely wounding Tanya's parents. She kidnaps Tanya and takes her back to her house. Charles is near death, but Mary revives him, and Charles makes a final attempt to drain Tanya's life force. However, Tanya plunges her fingers into his eyes, killing him. Tanya escapes with the help of the sheriff, whom Mary later impales on the picket fence surrounding the house. The cats that have been gathering around their house, led by Clovis, jump on Mary and claw and bite her until she bursts into flames and dies. Tanya hugs Clovis, her savior, as the other cats depart, leaving Mary's body lying ablaze on her former driveway.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Brian Krause]] as Charles Brady\n* [[Alice Krige]] as Mary Brady \n* [[M\u00e4dchen Amick]] as [[Tanya Robertson]]\n* [[Lyman Ward (actor)|Lyman Ward]] as Donald Robertson\n* [[Cindy Pickett]] as Helen Robertson\n* [[Ron Perlman]] as Captain Soames\n* Jim Haynie as Sheriff Ira Stevens\n* [[Dan Martin (actor)|Dan Martin]] as Deputy Andy Simpson\n* [[Lucy Boryer]] as Jeanette\n* [[Glenn Shadix]] as Mr. Fallows\n* Sparks as Clovis\n* [[Stephen King]] as Cemetery Caretaker\n* [[John Landis]] as Lab Technician\n* [[Joe Dante]] as Lab Assistant\n* [[Clive Barker]] as Forensic Tech\n* [[Tobe Hooper]] as Forensic Tech\n* [[Mark Hamill]] as Sheriff Jenkins (uncredited)\n}}\n\n== Production ==\n''Sleepwalkers'' was the first film written by King to not be based on one of his preexisting works. Columbia Pictures initially approached [[Rupert Wainwright]] to direct, but at King's insistence Columbia offered the film to [[Mick Garris]], who had previously directed the horror films ''[[Critters 2: The Main Course]]'' and ''[[Psycho IV: The Beginning]]''. The film was shot in [[Franklin Canyon Park]] in Los Angeles, California.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Warren|first=Bill|date=April 1992|title=Sleepwalkers Awaken|url=https://archive.org/details/Fangoria_111_1992_Sleepwalkers_QualityControl-BONES_c2c/page/n33|journal=[[Fangoria]]|issue=111|pages=36\u201340|via=[[Internet Archive]]}}</ref>\n\nGarris said there were a couple of ideas he put into the film that hadn't been in King's original script. One is the introduction and title sequence from that page in the \"Book of Arcane Knowledge\" (which he invented) to give it a little backstory. And another was the scene where the Sleepwalkers are making love.<ref>{{cite web |title=HDTGM: A Conversation With Mick Garris, Director Of 'Sleepwalkers' |work=www.slashfilm.com |date=April 12, 2017 |url=https://www.slashfilm.com/550319/mick-garris-interview-director-of-sleepwalkers |access-date=20 March 2022 }}</ref>\n\n==Soundtrack==\nThe original music score was composed by [[Nicholas Pike]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Nicholas Pike - Stephen King's Sleepwalkers (Music From The Original Motion Picture Soundtrack) |url=https://www.discogs.com/Nicholas-Pike-Stephen-Kings-Sleepwalkers-Music-From-The-Original-Motion-Picture-Soundtrack/master/700853 |website=Discogs |access-date=31 August 2021 |language=en}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ CD track listing\n!

I mean, the movie was successful, it was the #1 movie the week that it came out. I never heard the studio talk about it, but [[Tabitha King]], Stephen King's wife, actually wrote a treatment for a sequel to ''Sleepwalkers'' that involved a women's basketball team somehow. I'm not sure how, I never read it, but King was very excited that Tabby came up with this. But it was a sequel that nobody at the studio gave a shit about. You know, they liked the money that ''Sleepwalkers'' made, but it was not a prestige release by any means, so they never even thought about ''Sleepwalkers'' after.\" Both Garris and Russo then discussed a potential reboot, with Garris expressing surprise that there was seemingly no interest, with Russo admitting that \"We had a very flirtatious conversation with a production company about a year ago, maybe. It was nothing more than flirting.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=https://podbay.fm/p/post-mortem-with-mick-garris/e/1585724460 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210627030120/https://podbay.fm/p/post-mortem-with-mick-garris/e/1585724460 |archive-date=June 27, 2021 |title=82: Ask Mick Anything from Post Mortem with Mick Garris {{!}} Podcast Episode on Podbay}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.joblo.com/horror-movies/news/tabitha-king-wrote-a-treatment-for-sleepwalkers-2 |title = Tabitha King wrote a treatment for Sleepwalkers 2| date=April 2, 2020 }}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Vampire film]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|id=0105428|title=Sleepwalkers}}\n* {{AllMovie title|45169|Sleepwalkers}}\n* {{Mojo title|sleepwalkers|Sleepwalkers}}\n\n{{Stephen King}}\n{{Mick Garris}}\n{{Portal bar|Speculative fiction/Horror|Film|1990s}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Sleepwalkers (Film)}}\n[[Category:1992 films]]\n[[Category:1992 horror films]]\n[[Category:1992 fantasy films]]\n[[Category:1990s monster movies]]\n[[Category:American dark fantasy films]]\n[[Category:American monster movies]]\n[[Category:Columbia Pictures films]]\n[[Category:Films about cats]]\n[[Category:Films about invisibility]]\n[[Category:Films about shapeshifting]]\n[[Category:Films about telekinesis]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Mick Garris]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Nicholas Pike]]\n[[Category:Films set in Indiana]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Los Angeles]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by Stephen King]]\n[[Category:Human-derived fictional species]]\n[[Category:Incest in film]]\n[[Category:American vampire films]]\n[[Category:Films set in a movie theatre]]\n[[Category:Films about mother\u2013son relationships]]\n[[Category:1990s English-language films]]\n[[Category:1990s American films]]"}]}}}}
