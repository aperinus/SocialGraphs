Starring [[Scarlett Johansson]], [[Chris Evans (actor)|Chris Evans]], and [[Laura Linney]], the film tells the story of a [[college graduate]] who goes to work as a [[nanny]] for a rich and wealthy family in New York City. Ensconced in their home, she has to juggle their dysfunction, a new romance, and the child in her charge.\n\n''The Nanny Diaries'' was released in the United States on August 24, 2007 by [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] and [[The Weinstein Company]]. It received mixed reviews from critics and grossed $47 million against a $20 million budget.\n\n==Plot==\nTwenty-one-year-old Annie Braddock ([[Scarlett Johansson]]) has just graduated from [[Montclair State University]]. She has no idea what or who she wants to be. One day, while sitting in the park, Annie sees a young boy ([[Nicholas Art]]) about to be hit by a vehicle. Annie saves him and meets the boy's mother, who we meet as Mrs. X ([[Laura Linney]]). When she introduces herself as \"Annie\", Mrs. X mistakes her words for \"Nanny\" and hires her to look after Grayer, the boy she saved (Mrs. X also continues to call her \"Nanny\" instead of \"Annie\" throughout the film). Annie lies to her mother Judy ([[Donna Murphy]]) about taking a job at a bank and, in reality, moves into the Xs' apartment to be the nanny for Grayer.\n\nLife with the incredibly privileged Xs is not what she thought it would be, and her life is complicated further when she falls for \"Harvard Hottie\" ([[Chris Evans (actor)|Chris Evans]]), who lives in the building. Interspersed with her life as the Xs' nanny are her interactions with \"Harvard Hottie\" as well as her longtime friend Lynette.\n\nAnnie continues to keep her mother in the dark about her real job, giving her regular but false progress reports. Further complications arise when Judy decides to visit her, forcing Annie to pretend Lynette ([[Alicia Keys]]) and her roommate Calvin ([[Nate Corddry]]) are a couple and that their apartment is Annie's apartment. Judy ultimately finds out the truth when Grayer becomes severely ill, and Annie desperately calls her for help.\n\nAfter a rough start, Annie eventually bonds with Grayer, whom she addresses by his preferred code name, \"Grover\", and discovers that he is actually a sweet and loving child who is neglected by both his parents, which explains his uncontrollable behavior. Parallel to this, Annie begins to also notice that Grayer is not the only one being neglected: Mrs. X is as well, with Mr. X ([[Paul Giamatti]]) constantly being cruel to her and committing subtly obvious adultery. Mrs. X makes numerous attempts to make her husband love her, including lying to him about being pregnant with their second child. Annie soon realizes that Mrs. X's own cruel treatment of her is due to Mrs. X's growing frustrations from her dysfunctional marriage.\n\nThings take a turn for the worse during a family trip with the X's to [[Nantucket]]. She overhears Mrs. X telling a friend during a party that she has installed a \"nanny cam\" at their home in the city and plans to fire Annie after viewing footage showing Annie lovingly tending to Grayer (with Mrs. X grossly exaggerating her findings from the \"nanny cam\"). The next morning, Mr. X sexually assaults Annie just as Mrs. X enters the kitchen. She unreasonably fires Annie and sends her back to the city with her final payment of just $40.\n\nFlying into a rage, Annie finds the \"[[nanny cam]]\" in the X's house and records her feelings toward the Xs. Mrs. X brings the tape to the school meeting for the [[Upper East Side]] mothers. Thinking that the tape will show Annie feeding Grayer [[peanut butter and jelly]] straight from a jar, she requests the coordinator to play it for everyone to see. All other parents in the room hear as Annie reveals the real relationship between the Xs, in the process making Mrs. X come to terms with her own reality and false happiness.\n\nAnnie reconciles with her mother and continues to date \"Harvard Hottie\", whose real name is revealed to be Hayden. She is temporarily living with Lynette and Calvin, and pursuing her growing interest in [[anthropology]], much of which she learned through her time as the Xs' nanny.\n\nA few months later, Hayden hands Annie a letter from Mrs. X. Written in the letter is an apology and news about how Mrs. X left Mr. X, is raising Grayer alone and making stronger attempts to bond with him (and successfully doing so), and Grayer's overall improvement. She expresses her gratitude to Annie for waking her up and changing her life. Also in the letter, Mrs. X addresses Annie for the first time by her real name (instead of Nanny), and signs the letter with her own first name, Alexandra (instead of Mrs. X).\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Scarlett Johansson]] as Annie \"Nanny\" Braddock\n* [[Chris Evans (actor)|Chris Evans]] as Hayden \"Harvard Hottie\"\n* [[Laura Linney]] as Mrs. Alexandra X\n* [[Paul Giamatti]] as Mr. Stan X\n* [[Nicholas Art]] as Grayer Addison X\n* [[Donna Murphy]] as Judy Braddock\n* [[Alicia Keys]] as Lynette\n* [[Nate Corddry]] as Calvin\n* [[Nina Garbiras]] as Miss Chicago\n* [[Brande Roderick]] as Tanya\n* [[Heather Simms]] as Murnel\n* [[Julie White]] as Jane Gould\n* [[Judith Roberts (actress)|Judith Roberts]] as Milicent\n\n==Reception==\n=== Critical response ===\nOn [[Rotten Tomatoes]], 34% of 132 critics gave the film positive review, with an average rating of 5/10.
