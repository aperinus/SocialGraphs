The 32nd [[List of Walt Disney Animation Studios films|Disney animated feature film]] and the fifth produced during the [[Disney Renaissance]], the film is inspired by [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Hamlet]]'' with elements from the [[Bible|Biblical]] stories of [[Joseph (Genesis)|Joseph]] and [[Moses]] and Disney's 1942 film ''[[Bambi]]''. It was written by [[Irene Mecchi]], [[Jonathan Roberts (writer)|Jonathan Roberts]], and [[Linda Woolverton]]. The film features an [[Ensemble cast|ensemble voice cast]] that includes [[Matthew Broderick]], [[James Earl Jones]], [[Jeremy Irons]], [[Jonathan Taylor Thomas]], [[Nathan Lane]], [[Ernie Sabella]], [[Rowan Atkinson]] and [[Robert Guillaume]]. Its original songs were written by composer [[Elton John]] and lyricist [[Tim Rice]], with a score by [[Hans Zimmer]]. \n\nTaking place in a kingdom of lions in Africa, ''The Lion King'' tells the story of [[Simba]] (Swahili for lion), a young lion who is to succeed his father, [[Mufasa]], as King of the Pride Lands; however, after Simba's paternal uncle [[Scar (The Lion King)|Scar]] kills Mufasa to seize the throne, Simba is manipulated into thinking he was responsible and flees into [[exile]]. After growing up in the company of the carefree outcasts [[Timon and Pumbaa]], Simba receives valuable perspective from his childhood friend, [[Nala (The Lion King)|Nala]], and his [[shaman]], Rafiki, before returning to challenge Scar to end his [[tyranny]] and take his place in the Circle of Life as the rightful King.\n\n''The Lion King'' was released on June 15, 1994, to critical acclaim, praising the film for its music, story, themes, and animation. With an initial worldwide gross of $763&nbsp;million, it finished its theatrical run as the [[1994 in film#Highest grossing films|highest-grossing film of 1994]] and the [[List of highest-grossing films|second-highest-grossing film of all time]], behind ''[[Jurassic Park (film)|Jurassic Park]]'' (1993).<ref name=\"TheMovieYear\">{{cite news |last=Natale |first=Richard |url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1994-12-30-ca-14702-story.html |title=The Movie Year: Hollywood Loses Its Middle Class |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=December 30, 1994 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220123164750/https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1994-12-30-ca-14702-story.html |archive-date=January 23, 2022 |url-status=live}}</ref> It also held the title of the [[List of highest-grossing animated films|highest-grossing animated film]], until it was overtaken by ''[[Finding Nemo]]'' (2003).

Please check the word count before making any additions. -->\n\nIn the Pride Lands of Africa, a pride of lions rule over the animal kingdom from Pride Rock. King Mufasa and Queen Sarabi's newborn son, [[Simba]], is presented to the gathering animals by Rafiki the [[mandrill]], the kingdom's [[Shamanism|shaman]] and advisor. Mufasa's younger brother, [[Scar (The Lion King)|Scar]], covets the throne.\n\nAfter Simba grows into a cub, Mufasa shows him the Pride Lands and explains the responsibilities of kingship and the \"circle of life,\" which connects all living things. Scar tricks Simba and his best friend [[Nala (The Lion King)|Nala]] into exploring an [[elephants' graveyard|elephant graveyard]], and are chased by three hyenas named [[List of characters in The Lion King#Shenzi, Banzai, and Ed|Shenzi, Banzai, and Ed]]. Mufasa is alerted by his [[majordomo]], the [[hornbill]] Zazu, and rescues the cubs. Though disappointed with Simba for disobeying him and putting himself and Nala in danger, Mufasa forgives him and explains that the great kings of the past watch over them from the night sky, from which he will one day watch over Simba. Scar, having planned the attack, visits the hyenas and convinces them to help him kill Mufasa and Simba in exchange for hunting rights in the Pride Lands.\n\nScar sets a trap for Simba and Mufasa, luring Simba into a gorge and having the hyenas drive a large herd of [[wildebeest]] into a stampede to trample him. Mufasa saves Simba but ends up hanging perilously from the gorge's edge; he begs for Scar's help, but Scar throws Mufasa back into the stampede to his death. Scar tricks Simba into thinking that the event was his fault and tells him to leave the kingdom and never return. Once Simba flees, Scar orders the hyenas to kill Simba, but Simba escapes. Unaware of Simba's survival, Scar tells the pride that the stampede killed Mufasa and Simba and steps forward as the new king, allowing the hyenas into the Pride Lands.\n\nAfter Simba collapses in a desert, he is rescued by two outcasts, a [[meerkat]] and [[warthog]] named [[Timon and Pumbaa]]. Simba grows up with his two new friends in their oasis, living a carefree life under their motto \"[[hakuna matata]]\" (\"no worries\" in [[Swahili language|Swahili]]). Years later, an adult Simba rescues Timon and Pumbaa from a hungry lioness, who turns out to be Nala. She and Simba fall in love, and she urges him to return home, telling him that the Pride Lands have become drought-stricken under Scar's reign. Still feeling guilty over Mufasa's death, Simba refuses and storms off. He encounters Rafiki, who tells Simba that Mufasa's spirit lives on in him. Simba is visited by the spirit of Mufasa in the night sky, who tells him that he must take his place as king. After Rafiki advises Simba to learn from the past instead of run from it, Simba decides to return to the Pride Lands.\n\nAided by his friends, Simba sneaks past the hyenas at Pride Rock and confronts Scar. Scar taunts Simba over his role in Mufasa's death and backs him to the edge of the rock, where he reveals to Simba that he is the one who caused Mufasa's death. Enraged, Simba retaliates and forces Scar to reveal the truth to the rest of the pride. A battle breaks out, and Timon, Pumbaa, Rafiki, Zazu, and the lionesses fend off the hyenas. Scar attempts to escape, but is cornered by Simba at a ledge near the top of Pride Rock. Scar begs for mercy and blames his actions on the hyenas; Simba spares Scar's life but, quoting what Scar told him long ago, orders Scar to leave the Pride Lands forever. Scar attacks again, but after a brief battle Simba throws him off the ledge to the ground below. Scar survives the fall, but the hyenas, who overheard him blaming them, maul him to death.\n\nSimba takes his place as king and Nala becomes his queen. With the Pride Lands restored, Rafiki presents Simba and Nala's newborn cub to the assembled animals, continuing the circle of life.\n\n==Voice cast==\n{{main|List of The Lion King (franchise) characters|l1=List of ''The Lion King'' characters}}\n[[File:LionKingCharacters.jpg|right|thumb|300px|A promotional image of the characters from the film.

Katzenberg balked at the idea at first, but nevertheless encouraged Fink and his writers to develop a mythos to explain how lions serviced other animals by eating them.{{sfn|Geirland|Keidar|1999|p=49}} Another anecdote states the idea was conceived during a conversation between [[Jeffrey Katzenberg]], [[Roy E.

Tripp's treatment, dated on March 2, 1989, introduced the name \"Simba\" for the main character, who gets separated from his pride and is adopted by Kwashi, a baboon, and Mabu, a [[mongoose]]. He is later raised in a community of baboons. Simba battles an evil jackal named Ndogo, and reunites with his pride.{{sfn|Chandler|2018|pp=338\u2013339}} Later that same year, Fink recruited his friend J. T. Allen, a writer, to develop new story treatments. Fink and Allen had earlier made several trips to a Los Angeles zoo to observe the animal behavior that was to be featured in the script. Allen completed his script, which was titled ''The Lion King'', on January 19, 1990. However, Fink, Katzenberg, and Roy E. Disney felt Allen's script could benefit from a more experienced screenwriter, and turned to [[Ron Bass|Ronald Bass]], who had recently won an [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay|Academy Award]] for his screenplay for ''[[Rain Man]]'' (1988).

Of course, it's possible... Many story ideas developed and changed along the way, always just to make our story stronger. I could certainly understand ''Kimba''{{'}}s creators feeling angry if they felt we had stolen ideas from them. If I had been inspired by ''Kimba'' I would certainly acknowledge my inspiration.
