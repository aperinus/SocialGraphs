It is one of the later Venom Mob films which no longer starred Sun Chien or Lo Mang, who were replaced by new Venom members Wang Li and Chu Ko. It also gave a starring role to younger member Chin Siu-Ho. This, along with House Of Traps and Five Element Ninjas is one of the more violent and darker martial arts films.\n\n==Plot==\n\nThe insidious Masked Gang of hired killers have been terrorizing the countryside, with their mastery of the [[trident]] and an inherent brutality, raping and pillaging. But who are the men behind the mask, and what are the identities of the three chiefs in the gold masks? \n\n[[Chiang Sheng]] stars as Chi San Yuen, a martial arts expert and leader of a protective escort service of other expert fighters. Chi and his team are hired to find the Masked Gang and end their reign of terror. \n\nAlong the way Chi's team encounter Kao Yao ([[Philip Kwok]]) who was a former chief of the Masked Gang until he left the gang. He assists Chi's team in their struggle against the Masked Gang and helps to reveal that his replacement in the gang has already infiltrated Chi's group. The final confrontation between the Masked Gang and Chi's team of fighters lead to an all out battle at the Masked Gang's secret lair.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Philip Kwok]] aka Kuo Chui \u2013 Kao Yao\n*Lu Feng \u2013 Lin Yung Chi\n*Chiang Sheng \u2013 Chi San Yuen\n*Chu Ko \u2013 Liang Yung\n*[[Chin Siu-Ho]] \u2013 Chang Chung (as Hsiao Hau Chien)\n*Wang Li \u2013 Fong Su Kwong\n\n==External links==\n\n*[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0082153/ IMDb entry]\n*[http://www.hkcinemagic.com/en/f905-The-Masked-Avengers.html/ HK Cinemagic entry]\n\n\n{{Chang Cheh}}\n\n[[Category:Films directed by Chang Cheh]]\n[[Category:Kung fu films]]\n[[Category:1981 martial arts films]]\n[[Category:Shaw Brothers Studio films]]\n[[Category:1981 action films]]\n[[Category:Hong Kong martial arts films]]\n[[Category:Hong Kong action films]]\n[[Category:1981 films]]\n[[Category:1980s exploitation films]]\n[[Category:1980s Hong Kong films]]\n\n{{1980s-HongKong-film-stub}}\n{{martialart-film-stub}}"}]}}}}
