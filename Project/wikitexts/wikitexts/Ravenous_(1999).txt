It was not a box office success and failed to recoup much of its $12 million budget. However, despite initial reception being mixed when first released, it has since garnered a reputation as a [[cult film]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.slashfilm.com/569691/streaming-horror-ravenous/|title=31 Days Of Streaming Horror: 'Ravenous' Is A Cannibal Cult Classic|website=www.slashfilm.com|access-date=17 June 2022}}</ref>\n\n''Ravenous'' had a troubled history. Issues over budget and shooting schedules were still ongoing when filming was about to start in [[Slovakia]]. After the original director [[Milcho Manchevski]] walked off the set three weeks into production, he was replaced by Bird at the suggestion of actor Robert Carlyle.  [[Michael Nyman]] and [[Damon Albarn]] composed the film's score, which generated a significant amount of interest for its quirky and inventive use of loops, instruments and musical structure.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://lovehorror.co.uk/horror-features/41584/ravenous-damon-albarn-michael-nyman/|title=Ravenous \u2013 Damon Albarn & Michael Nyman |website=www.lovehorror.co.uk|date=May 6, 2020}}</ref>\n\nScreenwriter [[Ted Griffin]] wrote a script that combined elements from the [[Donner Party]] and that of the real life \"The Colorado Cannibal\", [[Alferd Packer]], who survived by eating five companions after becoming snowbound in the [[San Juan Mountains]] in the 1870s. However, the film's plot also serves as an overt criticism of [[Manifest destiny]] through its use of [[cannibalism]]. By turning the act into an insatiable hunger, the voracious need to eat human flesh is equated to the all-consuming pursuit of power and wealth that was inherent to the expansionist attitudes of those seeking to settle the [[American frontier]] in the 19th century.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.villagevoice.com/2014/06/18/forgotten-flick-ravenous-is-the-best-ever-manifest-destiny-cannibal-comedy/|title=Forgotten Flick Ravenous Is the Best-Ever Manifest Destiny Cannibal Comedy|website=www.villagevoice.com|date=June 18, 2014}}</ref>\n\n== Plot ==\nDuring the [[Mexican\u2013American War]], Second Lieutenant John Boyd, who is fighting in the [[United States Army]], finds his courage failing him in battle and plays dead as his unit is massacred. His body, along with the other dead, is put in a cart and hauled behind Mexican lines. However, in a moment of bravery, Boyd seizes the chance to capture the Mexican command post. His heroism earns him a captain's promotion, but when General Slauson learns of the cowardice through which victory was achieved, he posts Boyd into exile at Fort Spencer, a remote military outpost high in the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] commanded by the weary but genial Colonel Hart, and staffed by a motley array of misfits: the pious Private Toffler, the drug-addicted Private Cleaves, the drunken Major Knox and the ferocious Private Reich, in addition to the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] scout George and his sister Martha.\n\nShortly after Boyd joins the garrison, a [[Frostbite|frostbitten]] stranger named Colqhoun arrives telling a hellish tale about how his [[wagon train]] became lost in the mountain because a Colonel Ives had promised the party a shorter route to the Pacific Ocean. Instead he led them on a more circuitous route resulting in the party getting trapped by snow for three months. Wracked by starvation, Colqhoun and his fellow travellers were reduced to [[cannibalism]], while he alleges that Ives resorted to murder. A rescue party is assembled to retrieve any survivors and capture Ives. George warns those who are leaving about the [[Wendigo]] myth: anyone who consumes the flesh of their enemies takes their strength but becomes a demon cursed by an insatiable hunger for more human flesh.\n\nWhen the soldiers reach Ives' cave, Boyd and Reich investigate. They discover the bloody remains of five skeletons, and realise that Colqhoun is Ives and he murdered everyone. Colqhoun's plan is now to kill and eat the soldiers. Colqhoun quickly kills George, Toffler and Colonel Hart, and, after a brief struggle, Reich. Boyd escapes the massacre by jumping off a cliff but breaks his leg. He hides in a pit next to the body of Reich whom he eventually eats to stay alive.\n\nWhen a delirious and severely [[Psychological trauma|traumatized]] Boyd finally limps back to the fort, he returns to find it has been reinforced by General Slauson and a detachment of cavalry. Cleaves and Martha (who were on a supply mission and had not met Colqhoun) do not believe his wild tale, while the hung-over Knox cannot recall and refuses to back Boyd up. A second expedition to the cave finds no bodies or any trace of Colqhoun. A temporary commander is assigned to the fort but to Boyd's horror, it is Colqhoun, who is now calling himself Colonel Ives again. The men still refuse to believe Boyd because Colqhoun bears no sign of the wounds inflicted on him during the fight at the cave.\n\nSecretly, Colqhoun tells Boyd that he used to suffer from [[tuberculosis]] but when a Native scout told him the Wendigo myth, then he \"just had to try\" by murdering him and eating his flesh, a process that cured his disease. Colqhoun now plans to use the fort as a base to cannibalize passing travellers because, like the notion of [[Manifest destiny|Manifest Destiny]], the migrants had a calling just like himself. Boyd is soon suspected of murder after Cleaves is mysteriously killed. While chained up, he watches helplessly as Knox is murdered by Colqhoun's unexpected ally: Colonel Hart, back from the dead after the massacre. Colqhoun had saved Hart by feeding him his own men in order to gain his assistance. But like Colqhoun, he is now hopelessly addicted to human flesh. Colqhoun mortally wounds Boyd, forcing him to make a choice: eat or die.\n\nEventually, Boyd gives in and eats a stew made from Knox. However, rather than join the two men in their conspiracy to convert General Slauson, Boyd convinces Hart to free him so he can kill Colqhoun. Hart does so, but also asks to be killed because he no longer wants to live as a cannibal. Boyd agrees to this. Boyd and Colqhoun fight, inflicting grievous wounds on each other, as their recuperative powers sustain them. Eventually, Boyd forces Colqhoun into a large [[Trapping|bear trap]] that pins them both together. Colqhoun taunts Boyd by telling him that he will eat him, but soon dies. General Slauson returns, and while his aide looks around the dilapidated fort, the general tastes the meat stew left simmering on the fire. Martha sees the deceased Colqhoun and the dying Boyd together, closes the door, and walks away. Boyd does not eat Colqhoun and dies.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Guy Pearce]] as Captain John Boyd\n* [[Robert Carlyle]] as F.W.

One week before production, original director [[Milcho Manchevski]] was said to have submitted new storyboards, which would have required additional two weeks of shooting.<ref name=\"manchevski\">[https://ew.com/ew/article/0,,282561,00.html Directors Cut], Anita M. Busch, EW.com, April 10, 1998; Accessed April 4, 2012</ref> The production company, [[Fox 2000]], eventually agreed to an additional week, with complaints that Manchevski had refused production meetings with the producers. Meanwhile, Manchevski complained Fox 2000 executive [[Laura Ziskin]] micromanaged the production by vetoing his chosen technicians and casting against his wishes.\n\nShooting was delayed on the first day as Manchevski and the production were still negotiating over the production budget and shooting schedule. As filming commenced, Manchevski says Ziskin sent him notes on the rushes \"every day\", complaining about the amount of dirt on the costumes and the number of closeups.<ref name=\"bird\">[https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/film-they-all-but-ate-me-alive-1115720.html Film: They all but ate me alive!], Roger Clarke, The Independent, March 9, 1999;   Accessed April 4, 2012</ref> Screenwriter [[Ted Griffin]] was at hand for \"constant rewrites\" during the shooting.<ref name=\"manchevski\" />\n\nAfter three weeks of shooting, Ziskin arrived to the set with director [[Raja Gosnell]] in tow to dismiss Manchevski and place Gosnell in as a replacement. While Manchevski left the production, the cast has been said to have rejected Gosnell. Robert Carlyle then recommended Antonia Bird, his frequent collaborator and business partner, to take over.\n\nFollowing ten days of negotiations, Bird arrived in Prague to helm the production. She, too, would criticize the circumstances under which the filming was to take place, describing the allocated studio space as \"horrible\" and the scheduling of the shoot \"manipulative\".<ref name=\"bird\" /> She also went on to say her predecessor, Manchevski, should not be blamed for the problematic production.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fangoria.com/new/fango-flashback-ravenous/|title=FANGO Flashback: 'RAVENOUS'|website=Fangoria.com|access-date=August 29, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170830014833/http://www.fangoria.com/new/fango-flashback-ravenous/|archive-date=August 30, 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nBird suggests the final theatrical cut had elements introduced without her approval, as she expressed disdain over the voiceover narration and was interested in recutting the film for the European market.<ref name=\"bird\" />\n\nThis would be the last theatrical release to feature [[John Spencer (actor)|John Spencer]].\n\n== Soundtrack ==\n{{Main|Ravenous (soundtrack)}}\n\n== Reception ==\n=== Box office ===\n''Ravenous'' opened on March 19, 1999, in the United States in 1,040 cinemas, accumulating $1,040,727 over its opening weekend.
