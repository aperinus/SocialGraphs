Written by Antonioni, [[Mark Peploe]], and [[Peter Wollen]], the film is about a disillusioned [[United Kingdom|Anglo]]-[[United States|American]] journalist, David Locke ([[Jack Nicholson]]), who assumes the identity of a dead businessman while working on a documentary in [[Chad]], unaware that he is impersonating an arms dealer with connections to the rebels in the current civil war. Co-starring [[Maria Schneider (actress)|Maria Schneider]], ''The Passenger'' was the final film in Antonioni's three-picture deal with producer [[Carlo Ponti]] and [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]], after ''[[Blowup]]'' and ''[[Zabriskie Point (film)|Zabriskie Point]]'', and competed for the [[Palme d'Or]] at the [[1975 Cannes Film Festival|Cannes Film Festival]].<ref name=\"festival-cannes.com\">{{cite web |url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/2187/year/1975.html |title=Festival de Cannes: The Passenger |access-date=2009-05-02|work=festival-cannes.com}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nDavid Locke ([[Jack Nicholson]]) is a television journalist making a documentary film about post-colonial Africa. In order to finish the film, he is in the [[Sahara]] in northern [[Chad]] seeking to meet with and interview rebel fighters who are involved in the [[Chadian Civil War (1965\u201379)|Chadian Civil War]]. Struggling to find rebels to interview, he is further frustrated when his [[Land Rover Series#Series III|Land Rover]] gets stuck on a sand dune. After a long walk through the desert back to his hotel, a thoroughly dispirited Locke discovers that an Englishman (Robertson), who has also been staying in the same hotel, and with whom he had struck up a casual friendship, has died overnight in his room from a heart condition.\n\nLocke decides to switch identities with Robertson. Posing as Robertson, Locke reports his own death at the front desk, where the hotel manager mistakes Locke for Robertson, and the plan goes off without a hitch.\n\nIn London, Locke's wife Rachel ([[Jenny Runacre]]) has been having an affair with a man named Stephen ([[Steven Berkhoff]]). Rachel feels guilt-ridden and torn when she is informed of her husband's death, which we see reported in a newspaper obituary. She approaches Locke's friend, Martin ([[Ian Hendry]]), a television producer, in an attempt to get in touch with Robertson to try and learn more about her husband's last days. Meanwhile, Locke, posing as Robertson, has flown to [[Munich]] with the dead man's belongings, including his appointment book, which directs him to a locker in the airport. It contains a document wallet with a price-list and several photocopied pages illustrating armaments. After leaving the airport, and apparently acting on a whim, Locke follows a white horse and carriage to a wedding in a baroque chapel, where he waits at the back of the congregation. Once the wedding has finished and the guests have gone, two men who were observing Locke at the airport enter and ask why he did not contact them at the airport. They ask for \"the documents.\" After Locke hands them the papers from the locker, they give him an envelope of money and tell him that the second half is to be paid in [[Barcelona]]. It becomes apparent that Robertson was gun-running for the same rebels whom Locke had been trying to contact in the Sahara.\n\nPrompted by Robertson's diary entries, Locke flies to Barcelona. There he spots his colleague and friend the TV producer Martin, who tries to track Robertson down on behalf of Rachel. Locke encounters an architecture student ([[Maria Schneider (actress)|Maria Schneider]]), credited only as The Girl, while trying to hide in a [[Gaudi]] building, La Pedrera. He asks her to fetch his belongings from the hotel so that he won't be seen there by Martin, who is casing the lobby. Martin overhears that she is collecting the baggage, and he confronts her outside, requesting that she take him to meet Robertson. She suggests that he follow her in a taxi, but by luck she manages to lose him. She and Locke leave Barcelona and become lovers on the run.\n\nFlush with cash from the down payment on the arms he cannot deliver, Locke is nevertheless drawn to keep a meeting scheduled in Robertson's diary. His appointed contact, however, does not show up. Meanwhile, the men arranging the arms deal are abducted, interrogated and beaten by hitmen operating for the Chadian government.\n\nRachel receives Locke's belongings, returned from Africa. Having heard from Martin of his unsuccessful chase of the elusive Robertson, Rachel is shocked as she opens Locke's passport to Robertson's photo pasted inside. She heads to Spain to find Locke. The hitmen trail her. Rachel co-opts the Spanish police in her pursuit, but Locke and The Girl continue to flee. Locke eventually sends her away, instructing her to meet him later in [[Tangiers]], after he follows her advice to keep an appointment in the book, that is, to assume that part of Robertson\u2019s identity that believed in a cause. She departs by bus for Almer\u00eda.\n\nReaching the Hotel de la Gloria in the Spanish town of [[Osuna]], Locke finds out that The Girl has returned and booked a double room, posing as Mrs. Robertson. He again tries to persuade her to leave. She exits the hotel and dawdles around the dusty square outside. The Chadian agents arrive at the hotel, enter, and depart just before the police arrive with Rachel Locke. The Girl joins them, and the group enter Locke's room, where they discover that he is dead. When asked by the police whether they recognized him, Rachel says that she never knew him, and the Girl says, \"Yes.\"\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col|colwidth=30em}}\n*[[Jack Nicholson]] as David Locke\n*[[Maria Schneider (actress)|Maria Schneider]] as The Girl\n*[[Steven Berkoff]] as Stephen\n*[[Ian Hendry]] as Martin Knight\n*[[Jenny Runacre]] as Rachel Locke\n*Ambroise Bia as Achebe\n* [[Charles Mulvehill]] as David Robertson\n* [[Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Caffarel]] as Hotel Keeper\n* James Campbell as the Witch Doctor\n* [[Manfred Spies]] as the German Stranger\n* Jean-Baptiste Tiemele as Murderer\n* [[\u00c1ngel del Pozo]] as Police inspector\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\nPrincipal photography took place in the [[Illizi Province]] of [[Algeria]] (to depict [[Chad]]), [[London]], [[Munich]], [[Barcelona]] and locations across south-eastern [[Spain]] throughout mid-to-late 1973.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Taylor |first1=John Russell |title=\"American audiences\u2019 greater education seems to have evaporated\": Jack Nicholson interviewed in 1974 |url=https://www.bfi.org.uk/sight-and-sound/features/jack-nicholson-interview-1974-antonioni-passenger-easy-rider |website=BFI |access-date=5 June 2022}}</ref>\n\nIn a long take early in the film, Locke (Nicholson) is exchanging passport photos in his hotel room, with a tape recording playing an earlier conversation between Locke and Robertson, now dead. The camera pans, without a cut, to hold on Robertson's now live appearance on the balcony, when Locke appears beside him and the two of them continue talking, i.e. an in-camera in-single-shot flashback.\n\nThe film's [[penultimate]] shot is a seven-minute [[long take]] [[tracking shot]] which begins in Locke's hotel room, looking out onto a dusty, run-down square, pushes out through the bars of the hotel window into the square, rotates 180 degrees, and finally tracks back to a close exterior view of the room's interior.<ref name=\"pent shot\">Chatman, pp. 183\u2013185, 202</ref>\n* The location of the hotel is stated to be Osuna in the film. However, the bullring at the edge of the square is recognisably that of the one in the Spanish town of [[Vera, Spain|Vera]], in the [[province of Almer\u00eda]].<ref name=\"Rosenfeld\">{{cite web\n|url= http://www.davidsaulrosenfeld.com/endnotes.html#25\n|title= Note 25\n|author= David Saul Rosenfeld\n|year= 2007\n|work= Michelangelo Antionioni's L'eclisse.

Hence the footage had to be taken in the very late afternoon near dusk, in order to minimise the lighting contrast between the brightness outside and that in the room.\n* The square was windy and the crew needed stillness to ensure smooth camera movement. Antonioni tried putting the camera in a sphere so the wind might catch it less, but this would not fit through the window. In the scene, it appears that the bars may have been adjusted to be removed as the camera approached them.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}\n* The camera ran on a ceiling track in the hotel room and when it came outside the window, was meant to be picked up by a hook suspended from a giant crane nearly 30 metres high. A system of [[gyroscope]]s was fitted on the camera to steady it during the switch from this smooth indoor track to the crane outside. Meanwhile, the bars on the window had been given hinges. When the camera reached the window and the bars were no longer in the field of view, they were swung away to either side. At this time the camera's forward movement had to stop for a few seconds as the crane's hook grabbed it and took over from the track. To hide this, the lens was slowly and smoothly zoomed until the crane could pull the camera forward.<ref group=\"Note\">Only a year later (1976) the wholly portable [[Steadicam]], which uses a counterweight system rather than gyroscopes, became available for this kind of shot, greatly simplifying such setups.</ref> Then the cameraman walked the camera in a circle around the square, giving the crew time to shut the window bars before the camera returned to look through the window from the outside this time. Antonioni directed the scene from a van by means of monitors and microphones, talking to assistants who communicated his instructions to the actors and operators.<ref>Interview with Antonioni in ''L'ultima sequenza di Professione: Reporter'' (1974) directed by Andr\u00e9 S. Labarthe, available with English subtitles as ''The Last Sequence of The Passenger''.</ref>\n\nAlthough this is often referred to as the \"final shot\" of the film, there is one more. The last passage shows a small driving school car pulling away in the twilight, and the camera holds on the hotel as the film's credits begin to roll.\n\nSome years after the production ended, Nicholson had a dispute with [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] on an unrelated matter. Nicholson had a deal with MGM for developing and starring in another film, but when MGM abandoned that project, Nicholson demanded compensation; the result being the acquisition of this film. This explains why, out of the three productions by Carlo Ponti and Michelangelo Antonioni under contract for MGM beginning with ''[[Blowup]]'' (1966) and followed up by ''[[Zabriskie Point (film)|Zabriskie Point]]'' (1970), ownership of ''The Passenger'' was not eventually passed on to [[Warner Bros.]], Which acquired the pre-1986 MGM film library via their purchase of [[Turner Entertainment]], the initial purchaser of that library. For years Nicholson kept ''The Passenger'' out of circulation until [[Sony Pictures Classics]] approached him with an offer to restore and reissue the film.\n\nTwo books prominently placed on set in the movie are 'The Soul of the Ape', a pioneering work of [[ethology]] by [[Eugene Marais]] and 'De Lumumba aux colonels' (1966) by Anicet Kashamura & Patrice Lumumba.\n\n==Reception==\n[[File:Roof of Casa Mila, Barcelona.jpg|thumb|right|300px|<center>Roof of [[Casa Mila|La Pedrera]] in Barcelona, as seen in 2005.

[[Roger Ebert]] gave the film a negative review in 1975, but revisiting it in 2005, he was much more positive, writing that it was a perceptive look at identity, alienation and the human desire to escape oneself.<ref name=\"rogerebert.com\">{{cite web |url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/the-passenger-2005 |title=Roger Ebert Reviews: The Passenger|access-date=2015-07-06|work=rogerebert.com}}</ref> It was placed 110th in the 2012 ''[[Sight & Sound]]'' critics' poll,{{citation needed|date=December 2021}} and was selected by ''[[Empire (film magazine)|Empire]]'' magazine as one of ''The 500 Greatest Movies of All Time''.<ref name=\"Empire\"/>\n\n[[John Simon (critic)|John Simon]] held a differing opinion of The Passenger. He wrote- \"Emptiness is everywhere: in landscapes and townscapes, churches and hotel rooms, and most of all in the script. Never was dialogue more pretentiously vacuous, plot more rudimentary yet preposterous, action more haphazard and spasmodic, characterization more tenuous and uninvolving, filmmaking more devoid of all but postures and pretensions\".<ref>{{cite book |title=John Simon: Something to Declare Twelve Years Of Films From Abroad|last1=Simon|first1=John |publisher=Clarkson N.
