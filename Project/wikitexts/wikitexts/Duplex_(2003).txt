The film stars [[Ben Stiller]], [[Drew Barrymore]], [[Eileen Essell]], [[Harvey Fierstein]], [[Justin Theroux]], and [[James Remar]].<ref>[http://www.viewbirmingham.co.uk/films/our-house-film-review-7295.html \"Our House Film Review\"], viewbirmingham.co.uk</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nYoung, professional [[New York City|New York]] couple \nAlex Rose and Nancy Kendricks, are in search of their dream home. The seemingly perfect Brooklyn brownstone duplex has one flaw: Mrs. Connelly, an old Irish lady who lives on the [[rent control|rent-controlled]] top floor. Assuming she won't live long, they buy the apartment.\n\nHowever, they soon realize Mrs. Connelly is lively, enjoys blasting her TV 24-7 and rehearsing in a [[brass band]]. A novelist, Alex must finish his latest against a looming deadline. However, he is interrupted constantly daily by Mrs. Connelly, and it quickly escalates into an all-out war. They try to get her to move out, but she refuses. Next, they try to file a [[noise complaint]] against her, but discover that she has gone to the police first and filed a harassment charge against them. Their friends turn against them when she play-acts as the \"poor, innocent, old lady\" making it appear they are out to harm her.\n\nNancy loses her job and Alex misses his deadline thanks to the old lady's antics, so they are trapped at home together with Mrs. Connelly with no place to go. Their rage turns to homicidal fantasy as they plot ways to get rid of their manipulative, no-good neighbor. Peace overtures and a break-in lead to nothing, so they hire a [[hitman]], Chick, to kill her. His asking price for the hit is $25,000. Desperate and needing the money in two days, they sell almost everything they own to pay for the Christmas Eve hit.\n\nChick breaks into Mrs. Connelly's apartment as planned, but fails to kill her as she defends herself with a [[speargun]], shooting him in the shoulder. She is incapacitated in the fight, and the duplex catches fire. Nancy and Alex appear to leave her to die, but then return and save her and her parrot. The fire department puts out the fire. Accepting defeat, Alex and Nancy leave, and find out the old woman has just died. Moving away, they contemplate their strange encounter.\n\nWe then learn they are not the first to be elaborately scammed by: the realtor of the duplex, Kenneth (Mrs. Connelly's son); the ill-tempered NYPD Officer Dan (Kenneth's boyfriend) who had frequently harassed and distrusted the couple, always siding with Mrs. Connelly in her disputes against them, and Mrs. Connelly herself (who is not in fact dead).\n\nThe real-estate scam has been run by the trio for several years: Kenneth sells the ground-floor apartment to an unsuspecting, naive young couple. Then Mrs. Connelly, aided by Dan, harasses them, eventually forcing them to move out. Finally, she [[Faked death|fakes her own death]] so they will never suspect a thing, thus leaving them to collect and live off of the sales commission from the next unsuspecting occupants. Alex and Nancy were their latest victims among many. Despite everything, as they celebrate their latest victory, she admits she actually liked Alex and Nancy and hopes they find success and happiness elsewhere.\n\nA final voice-over by Alex relates that he and Nancy relocated to [[The Bronx]]. Like the other couples the trio scammed, they never saw Mrs. Connelly or returned to Brooklyn again. Alex used their unpleasant experience as inspiration for his next book entitled ''Duplex'', which became a best-seller, rescuing him and Nancy from poverty and giving the film a semi-happy ending.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Ben Stiller]] as Alex Rose\n* [[Drew Barrymore]] as Nancy Kendricks\n* [[Eileen Essell]] as Mrs. Connelly\n* [[Harvey Fierstein]] as Kenneth\n* [[Justin Theroux]] as Coop\n* [[James Remar]] as Chick\n* [[Robert Wisdom]] as Officer Dan\n* [[Swoosie Kurtz]] as Jean\n* [[Wallace Shawn]] as Herman\n* [[Maya Rudolph]] as Tara\n* [[Amber Valletta]] as Celine\n* [[Michelle Krusiec]] as Dr. Kang\n* [[Tracey Walter]] as Pharmacy Customer\n* [[Danny DeVito]] as Narrator (voice) (Uncredited)\n\n==Reception==\n''Duplex'' has a 50/100 on [[Metacritic]] and a 35% approval rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]]. The site's consensus states: \"It was funnier when it was called ''[[Throw Momma from the Train]]''.\"<ref>[http://www.metacritic.com/video/titles/duplex?q=Duplex Duplex (2003) - Metacritic]</ref><ref>[http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/duplex/ Duplex (2003) - Rotten Tomatoes]</ref>  [[Roger Ebert]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' gave the film two stars out of four and wrote that the \"murder schemes aimed at Mrs. Connelly don't generate the laughter they should, maybe because no matter what she does, she still seems, irremediably, unredeemably, a sweet little old lady. [...] 'Duplex' is all about plotting; it tries to impose emotions that we don't really feel. We can't identify with Mrs. Connelly, that's for sure, but we can't identify with Alex and Nancy, either, because we don't share their frustration -- and the reason we don't is because we don't believe it. There's too much contrivance and not enough plausibility, and so finally we're just enjoying the performances and wishing they'd been in a more persuasive movie.\"<ref>Roger Ebert (September 26, 2003).
