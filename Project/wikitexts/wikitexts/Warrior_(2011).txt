It stars [[Tom Hardy]] and [[Joel Edgerton]] as two estranged brothers whose entrance into a [[mixed martial arts]] tournament makes them come to terms with their lives and each other. [[Nick Nolte]], [[Jennifer Morrison]], [[Frank Grillo]], and [[Bryan Callen]] appear in supporting roles. Real-life MMA and combat sports figures like [[Kurt Angle]], [[Nate Marquardt]], [[Anthony Johnson (fighter)|Anthony Johnson]], [[Roan Carneiro]], [[Yves Edwards]], [[Amir Perets]], and [[Dan Caldwell]] make appearances.\n\nThe film was theatrically released in the United States on September 9, 2011, by [[Lionsgate]]. Although not commercially successful, the film received positive reviews from critics, with Nolte receiving an [[Academy Award]] nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Supporting Actor]].\n\n==Plot==\n[[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marine]] Tommy Riordan visits his father, Paddy Conlon, a recovering alcoholic who has returned to his Catholic faith in [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]]. As a child, Tommy had to run away from Paddy with his dying mother due to Paddy being an abusive alcoholic, and has never forgiven him. Paddy tries to convince him that he has changed, but to no avail. The next day, Tommy enters a gym where he quickly knocks out Pete \"Mad Dog\" Grimes, a professional fighter; a video of the fight goes [[viral video|viral]] on the internet. Learning about a winner-takes-all [[mixed martial arts]] tournament called Sparta, whose winner will receive $5 million, Tommy asks Paddy to help him train for the tournament, but only under the condition that Paddy does not try to reconcile their relationship.\n\nTommy's older brother Brendan, a high school physics teacher and former MMA fighter, is struggling to provide for his wife, Tess, and their two daughters. He had to mortgage his house in [[Philadelphia]] to pay for his younger daughter's [[open heart surgery]], and is now in danger of losing everything. To increase his income, Brendan battles amateur fighters for money. He is suspended without pay after rumors of his secret life spread around the school. Paddy meets Brendan in his driveway to try to reconcile with him, albeit unsuccessfully, and to tell him that Tommy is back in town. Out of options, Brendan seeks the training of old friend Frank Campana and begins competing in smaller venue fights. After the fighter Frank planned to enter into the Sparta tournament is injured, Brendan convinces Frank to enter him as a replacement.\n\nWhen the brothers separately enter the tournament, it is revealed that Tommy is still angry at Brendan for staying behind for Tess when Tommy and their mother left Paddy; Tommy was left to care for their mother when she became [[terminal illness|terminally ill]]. Brendan claims that he could not help having been in love with Tess and that he has forgiven his father for the wrong he has done, but Tommy is unconvinced.\n\nMeanwhile, the video of Tommy beating Grimes attracts the attention of a Marine, who tells the press that Tommy saved his life in Iraq. Although Tommy becomes a national hero, his military records reveal that he [[desertion|deserted]] after his entire unit was killed in a [[friendly fire]] bombing; Tommy had been using his mother's maiden name as his own surname to evade arrest for his desertion. He reveals to have pledged to give his winnings to the widow of one of his fallen friends. The military police will take him into custody but will wait until after the tournament is over.\n\nOver two nights, Brendan and Tommy have contrasting fortunes: Tommy quickly and brutally [[knockout|knocks out]] opponents, while Brendan is outmatched physically but uses [[Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu]] to force grappling [[submission (combat sport)|submissions]]. In the semifinals, Brendan is matched up with undefeated Russian wrestler Koba, who dominates him in two rounds. In round three, Brendan swings for the fences, making the bout a back and forth battle. In the closing moments of the final round, Koba takes Brendan's back from the [[clinch fighting|clinch]] and Brendan goes for a rolling [[kneebar]]. As Koba attempts to escape the position, Brendan quickly reverses and readjusts the kneebar, narrowly winning by submission. Tommy is matched up with Grimes, again knocking him unconscious almost immediately.\n\nThe night before the final day, Paddy attempts to talk to Tommy about his actions in Iraq. Tommy angrily dismisses his father, who relapses and starts drinking again. Seeing his terrible pain, Tommy calms and comforts him.\n\nTommy and Brendan's relationship is revealed to the world when they are the tournament's last remaining fighters. Despite Brendan's desire to reconcile, Tommy shows no interest in doing so. Tommy wins the first two rounds, but Brendan eventually dislocates Tommy's shoulder with an [[omoplata]] arm-lock. As the fourth round starts, Brendan insists Tommy give up as Tommy only has use of one arm. As Tommy continues trying to knock Brendan out, Brendan unloads a barrage of strikes trying to end the fight. Tommy goads Brendan to continue hitting him as the fourth round ends. At the start of Round 5, Brendan refuses to fight, but Tommy persists. Brendan realizes he has to force him to submit, and he traps Tommy in a [[rear naked choke]]. As they struggle on the canvas, Brendan apologizes to Tommy and tells him that he loves him. After some hesitation, Tommy submits. The reconciled brothers exit the ring as their father looks on smiling.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Tom Hardy]] as Tommy Riordan Conlon\n* [[Joel Edgerton]] as Brendan Conlon \n* [[Nick Nolte]] as Paddy Conlon\n* [[Jennifer Morrison]] as Tess Conlon\n* [[Frank Grillo]] as Frank Campana\n* [[Kevin Dunn]] as Principal Joe Zito\n* Vanessa Martinez as Pilar Fernandez\n* [[Noah Emmerich]] as Dan Taylor\n* Laura Chinn as K.C.\n* Capri Thomas as Emily Conlon\n* Lexi Cowan as Rosie Conlon\n* [[Denzel Whitaker]] as Stephon\n* Carlos Miranda as Tito\n* Nick Lehane as Nash\n* Charlie Smith as Leo\n* [[Maximiliano Hern\u00e1ndez]] as Colt Boyd\n* [[Fernando Chien]] as Ian Fenroy\n* [[Kurt Angle]] as Koba\n* [[Erik Apple]] as Pete \"Mad Dog\" Grimes\n* [[Nate Marquardt]] as Karl \"The Dane\" Kruller\n* [[Anthony Johnson (fighter)|Anthony Johnson]] as Orlando \"Midnight Black\" Le\n* [[Roan Carneiro]] as Marcos Santos\n* [[Yves Edwards]] as Houston Greggs\n* [[Gavin O'Connor (filmmaker)|Gavin O'Connor]] as J.J.
