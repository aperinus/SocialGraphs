Walsh]], and [[Dennis Hopper]]. It was written by Dahl and his brother Rick, and shot in [[Montana]], [[Willcox, Arizona]], [[Sonoita, Arizona]] and [[Elgin, Arizona]].\n\n==Plot==\nMichael Williams is a drifter living out of his car after being discharged from the Marine Corps. A job on an oilfield falls through due to his unwillingness to conceal a war injury on his job application, so Michael wanders into rural Red Rock, [[Wyoming]], looking for other work. A local bar owner named Wayne mistakes him for a hitman, \"Lyle from Dallas\", whom Wayne has hired to kill his wife. Wayne offers him a stack of cash\u2014\"half now, half later\"\u2014and Michael plays along by taking the money.\n\nMichael visits Wayne's wife, Suzanne, and instead of killing her, he attempts to warn her that her life is in danger. She offers him more money to kill Wayne. Michael tries to leave town but a car accident leads him to encounter the local sheriff, who turns out to be Wayne. Michael manages to escape from Wayne but runs into the real Lyle from Dallas. Lyle and Wayne quickly figure out what has transpired, while Michael desperately tries to warn Suzanne before Lyle finds her.\n\nThe next morning, when Lyle comes to get money from Wayne, he kidnaps both Suzanne and Michael, who are trying to retrieve hidden cash from Wayne's office. Wayne and Suzanne are revealed to be wanted for embezzlement and Wayne is arrested by his own deputies. Lyle returns with Michael and Suzanne hostage and gets Wayne out of jail to retrieve their stash of money. At a remote graveyard, Wayne pulls a gun from the case of money and holds Lyle at gunpoint before Lyle throws a knife into Wayne's neck. Michael and Lyle fight, with Lyle ending up being impaled on a grave marker. When Lyle rises to attack Michael, Suzanne shoots him dead.\n\nMichael and Suzanne get onto a nearby train, but when Suzanne tries to betray Michael, he throws much of the money out of the speeding train and then throws Suzanne off to be arrested by the police accompanied by a wounded Wayne. He remarks finally, \"Adios, Red Rock\". Michael has stored away some of the cash for himself and keeps riding the train into a new town.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Nicolas Cage]] as Michael Williams\n* [[Dennis Hopper]] as Lyle, From Dallas\n* [[Lara Flynn Boyle]] as Ann McCord / Suzanne Brown\n* [[J.T.
