Directed by [[Julie Anne Robinson]], the screenplay was written by [[Liz Brixius]], [[Karen McCullah Lutz]], and [[Kirsten Smith (writer)|Kirsten Smith]]. It stars [[Katherine Heigl]], [[Jason O'Mara]], [[Debbie Reynolds]], [[Daniel Sunjata]] and [[Sherri Shepherd]]. The story revolves around [[Stephanie Plum]], a broke and unemployed woman becoming a [[bounty hunter|bail enforcement agent]], going after a former high school crush who both skipped out on his payments and is a murder suspect.\n\nThe film was in [[development hell]] after [[Columbia Pictures|Columbia]] and [[TriStar Pictures]] had purchased the novel's adaptation rights in 1997. In April 2010, [[Lionsgate]] acquired the distribution rights. Produced by [[Lakeshore Entertainment|Lakeshore]] and [[Sidney Kimmel Entertainment]], [[principal photography]] took place in the [[Ambridge, Pennsylvania|Ambridge]] borough in [[Beaver County, Pennsylvania]]. This film was the last theatrical appearance of Debbie Reynolds before her death on December 28, 2016.\n \n''One for the Money'' was theatrically released in the United States on January 27, 2012 and was both a critical and commercial failure. The film received extremely negative reviews from critics, with many criticizing the script and Heigl's performance, and grossed just $38 million worldwide against a $40 million budget.\n\n==Plot==\nIn the [[Chambersburg, Trenton, New Jersey|Chambersburg]] neighborhood of [[Trenton, New Jersey]], [[Stephanie Plum]] is divorced and out of work. Seeking a job at her cousin Vinnie's [[bail bondsman|bail bonds]] business, she blackmails him into letting her become a [[bounty hunter|bail enforcement agent]] and tracks down fugitive Joe Morelli, her high school ex-boyfriend who has skipped his $500,000 bail. Morelli escapes the inexperienced Stephanie, who turns to veteran bounty hunter Ricardo \"Ranger\" Manoso for help. Explaining that Morelli, a [[vice squad|vice detective]], is wanted for the murder of heroin dealer Ziggy Kulesza, Ranger buys Stephanie a gun.\n\nPolice officer Eddie Gazarra, Stephanie's friend, informs her that Morelli shot Ziggy at the apartment of prostitute Carmen Sanchez. Morelli claimed to act in self-defense, but no evidence could be found that Ziggy had a gun, and Carmen and another man at the apartment have disappeared. Stephanie befriends a prostitute named Lula, who points her to a boxing gym where she questions [[mixed martial arts|cage fighter]] Benito Ramirez, Carmen's boyfriend, and his manager Jimmy Alpha. Before Ramirez can assault her, she is rescued by Morelli, who reveals that Carmen was his informant and suspects Ramirez is responsible for her disappearance.\n\nStephanie receives a threatening call from Ramirez, and commandeers Morelli's car after searching his apartment. Desperate for money, she recovers her first fugitive, delivering her nudist neighbor to the police for [[failure to appear]]. In the shower, she is confronted by Morelli and left handcuffed and naked, forcing her to call Ranger for help. She visits Carmen's apartment and meets John Cho, a neighbor who witnessed the shooting. He explains that he knocked Morelli unconscious, after which a \"flat-nosed guy\" fled the apartment. After capturing another fugitive, who first steals her gun and shoots at Ranger, Stephanie learns that Cho has been killed.\n\nShe is tailed by Ramirez, who leaves Lula badly beaten outside Stephanie's apartment. Morelli asks for Stephanie's help in clearing his name, in exchange for sole credit and payment for his capture, and she agrees, allowing him to lay low at her apartment. Vinnie's regular recovery agent Morty Beyers arrives to take over Morelli's bounty, and steals the keys to Morelli's car, but is killed by a car bomb intended for Stephanie, and Carmen\u2019s apartment building is fire-bombed. Wearing a [[covert listening device|wire]] so Morelli can track her movements from nearby, Stephanie spots the flat-nosed man at a butcher shop frequented by Ziggy. The man loads two barrels onto a truck, and Stephanie follows him and the butcher to a marina, where she and Morelli discover the butcher\u2019s boat is being used to transport heroin.\n\nHearing gunshots, they find the flat-nosed man and the butcher shot dead in the truck, and Carmen's body in one of the barrels. They are attacked by Ramirez and subdue him, but are held at gunpoint by Jimmy Alpha. He admits that he, Ramirez, and Ziggy were selling heroin, and killed Carmen for informing on them to Morelli; at Carmen\u2019s apartment, Ziggy did try to kill Morelli, but the flat-nosed man fled with Ziggy's gun. Stephanie manages to shoot Jimmy dead, but locks Morelli in the truck and delivers him to the police, along with her covert recording of Jimmy's confession, which exonerates Morelli. She collects the $50,000 bounty for Morelli, who arrives at her door, and they rekindle their relationship.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Katherine Heigl]] as [[Stephanie Plum]]\n* [[Jason O'Mara]] as Joseph \"Joe\" Morelli\n* [[Daniel Sunjata]] as Ricardo \"Ranger\" Carlos Manoso\n* [[John Leguizamo]] as Jimmy Alpha\n* [[Sherri Shepherd]] as Lula\n* [[Debbie Reynolds]] as Grandma Edna Mazur\n* [[Debra Monk]] as Helen Mazur Plum\n* Nate Mooney as Eddie Gazarra\n* Adam Paul as Bernie Kuntz\n* [[Fisher Stevens]] as Morty Beyers\n* Ana Reeder as Connie Rossoli\n* [[Patrick Fischler]] as Vinnie Plum\n* [[Ryan Michelle Bathe]] as Jackie\n* [[Leonardo Nam]] as John Cho\n* [[Annie Parisse]] as Mary Lou\n* [[Danny Mastrogiorgio]] as Lenny\n* Gavin-Keith Umeh as Benito Ramirez\n* [[Louis Mustillo]] as Frank Plum\n* [[Joshua Elijah Reese]] as Cop\n* [[Olga Merediz]] as Rosa Gomez\n\n==Production==\nIn an October 2010 interview, author [[Janet Evanovich]] stated that [[TriStar Pictures]] had purchased the rights to her novel thirteen years previously, and the film had been in [[development hell]] since that time.
