In the film, a family man of the future is illegally [[Human cloning|cloned]] by accident as part of a vast conspiracy involving a shady billionaire businessman, and is thrust into a struggle to clear his name and protect his family from the conspirators who seek to keep the cloning a secret. The title refers to the [[Abrahamic religions|Judeo-Christian]] [[Genesis creation narrative]], where God created mankind on the sixth day. The film was [[Terry Crews]]' acting debut.\n\nSchwarzenegger received a salary of $25 million for his role in the film.<ref name = \"BusinessWeek256thday\">{{cite news | title = Schwarzenegger Flexes Some Muscle | first = Ronald | last = Grover  | url = https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2002-01-24/schwarzenegger-flexes-some-muscle | work = [[BusinessWeek]] | date = 2002-01-25 | access-date = 2017-04-07 }}</ref> The film received mixed reviews and was a [[box-office bomb|box office failure]], earning $96 million worldwide on a budget of $82 million.\n\n==Plot==\nIn the near future, animal [[cloning]] has become routine, but [[human cloning]] is prohibited by so-called \"[[Genesis creation narrative|Sixth Day]]\" laws.\n\nCharter pilot Adam Gibson is hired for a [[snowboarding]] excursion by Michael Drucker, billionaire owner of cloning corporation Replacement Technologies, who requires him to undergo a seemingly routine drug test. When Adam\u2019s wife informs him that their daughter\u2019s dog has died, he reluctantly visits one of Drucker\u2019s \u201cRePet\u201d cloning stores, while his partner Hank poses as Adam and flies Drucker to the mountains, where they are killed by an assassin, Tripp.\n\nBuying a life-size [[animatronic]] \u201cSimPal\u201d doll for his daughter instead, Adam returns home to discover a clone of himself with his family. Before he can intervene, Adam is abducted by Marshall, Drucker\u2019s head of security, and his agents Talia, Vincent, and Wiley. Adam escapes, killing Talia and Wiley, and goes to the police but is believed to be an escaped mental patient.\n\nDrucker, somehow alive, assures reporters that he does not intend to have the Sixth Day laws repealed. However, he and his chief scientist, Dr. Griffin Weir, have already perfected illegal human cloning, and revive clones of Talia and Wiley. Adam breaks out of the police station and is forced to kill Wiley again, before finding Hank at his apartment, still alive. He brings Hank to his house and contemplates killing his clone, but Marshall and Talia arrive, forcing Adam to pose as his clone to send them away.\n\nReturning to his apartment, Hank is again killed by Tripp, who is shot by Adam. A dying Tripp reveals he is an [[ethics of cloning|anti-cloning]] extremist who assassinated Drucker, who was subsequently cloned along with Hank. Marshall and Talia arrive, but Adam escapes in their vehicle after shooting off Talia\u2019s fingers, taking her thumb to bypass the car\u2019s [[biometric device|biometric lock]]. Adam uses the thumb to sneak into Replacement Technologies and confronts Dr. Weir, whose pursuit of cloning is driven by his wife Katherine\u2019s [[liver cancer]]; she reveals to her husband that she knows she is the latest in a series of clones he has made in an attempt to cure her.\n\nWeir explains that the blood and vision tests Adam underwent scanned his DNA and memories \u2014 captured as a \u201csyncording\u201d \u2014 in the event he needed to be cloned. He reveals Drucker was secretly cloned after dying years earlier to maintain control of his fortune, as clones have no legal rights. Believing both Adam and Hank were killed alongside Drucker, Weir cloned them to return to their lives and cover up Drucker\u2019s murder and second cloning. Weir gives Adam the syncording proving Drucker has been cloned, warning that he may go after Adam\u2019s clone and family.\n\nAdam races to Clara\u2019s school recital, where Talia and Vincent have already abducted his wife and daughter. Coming face-to-face with his own clone, Adam reveals their situation, and agrees to deliver the incriminating syncording to Drucker in exchange for his family. Weir confronts Drucker, who engineered the clones, including Katherine, with [[birth defects|shortened lifespans]] as an insurance policy against betrayal. Drucker kills Weir, promising to resurrect him and Katherine as clones.\n\nSending a decoy helicopter to be destroyed, Adam lands on Drucker\u2019s [[helipad]] and wreaks havoc until he is captured. Drucker reveals that Adam is actually the clone, proven by a marking inside his eyelid, but realizes the real Adam has also infiltrated the building. While the original Adam rescues his family, his clone fights off Drucker\u2019s agents. They are finally killed, and a mortally wounded Drucker clones himself again, but the malfunctioning equipment creates a deformed, incomplete body. Adam and his clone escape in the helicopter with his family, destroying the facility and all its syncordings as Drucker falls to his death.\n\nThe real Adam arranges for his clone to start a new life in [[Argentina]], running a satellite office of their charter business. As a parting gift, the clone gives the family Hank's RePet cat, and the real Adam gives his clone a flying send-off.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] as Adam Gibson / Adam Gibson Clone\n* [[Tony Goldwyn]] as Michael Drucker, the CEO of Replacement Technologies\n* [[Michael Rapaport]] as Hank Morgan, Adam's best friend\n* [[Michael Rooker]] as Robert Marshall, a Millennium security agent and Drucker's right-hand man\n* [[Sarah Wynter]] as Talia Elsworth, an assassin working for Drucker\n* [[Wendy Crewson]] as Natalie Gibson, Adam's wife\n* [[Rodney Rowland]] as P.
