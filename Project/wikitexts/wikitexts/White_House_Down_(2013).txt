In the film, a divorced [[United States Capitol Police|US Capitol Police]] officer attempts to rescue both his daughter and the [[President of the United States]] when a destructive terrorist assault occurs in the [[White House]]. The film stars [[Channing Tatum]], [[Jamie Foxx]], [[Maggie Gyllenhaal]], [[Jason Clarke]], [[Richard Jenkins]], and [[James Woods]].\n\nReleased on June 28, 2013 by [[Sony Pictures Releasing]], ''White House Down'' received mixed reviews from critics toward the screenwriting and the clich\u00e9d storyline, although the performances and action sequences were praised. The film grossed over $205 million worldwide at the box office, against a budget of $150 million. ''White House Down'' was one of two films released in 2013 that dealt with a terrorist attack on the White House; the other, ''[[Olympus Has Fallen]]'', was released three months earlier.\n\n==Plot==\n[[President of the United States|U.S. President]] James Sawyer makes a controversial proposal to remove military forces from the [[Middle East]]. Divorced [[veteran]] John Cale works as a [[United States Capitol Police|Capitol Police]] officer assigned to [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker of the House]] Eli Raphelson, whose nephew he saved while serving in [[War in Afghanistan (2001\u2013present)|Afghanistan]]. Cale hopes to impress his daughter Emily by interviewing for the [[United States Secret Service|Secret Service]], getting tickets for them to tour the [[White House]]. His interviewer, Deputy Special Agent-in-Charge Carol Finnerty, a college acquaintance, deems him unqualified for the job.\n\nMeanwhile, Cale and his daughter take a guided tour of the White House. Meanwhile, a mysterious man disguised as a janitor detonate a bomb in the [[United States Capitol]], collapsing the rotunda and sending [[Washington, D.C.]] into [[lockdown]]. Finnerty escorts Raphelson to an underground command center in [[the Pentagon]], while [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] Alvin Hammond is taken aboard [[Air Force One]]. At the same time, a paramilitary team of [[mercenaries]] led by ex-[[Delta Force]] and [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] operative Emil Stenz infiltrate the White House and overwhelm the Secret Service, seizing the building. The tour group is taken hostage in the [[Blue Room (White House)|Blue Room]] by [[white nationalist]] Carl Killick, but Cale escapes to search for Emily, separated during the tour. Retiring Head of the Presidential Detail, Special Agent-in-Charge Martin Walker brings Sawyer to the [[Presidential Emergency Operations Center|PEOC]] beneath the [[Library (White House)|White House Library]]. Inside, Walker kills Sawyer's detail, including fellow agent Ted Hope, revealing himself as the leader of the attack, apparently seeking vengeance against Sawyer for his [[United States Marine Corps|Marine]] son, Kevin Walker, who was killed in a botched mission in [[Iran]] the year prior. Cale kills a mercenary, taking his weapon and radio, and rescues Sawyer after overhearing Walker.\n\nWalker brings in ex-[[National Security Agency|NSA]] analyst Skip Tyler to hack the PEOC's defense system, but requires Sawyer to activate the [[nuclear football]]. Killick catches Emily filming the intruders on her phone and takes her hostage. Cale and Sawyer contact the command structure via a [[scrambler|scrambled]] [[satellite phone]] in the residence, whereas Finnerty uses Emily's [[YouTube]] video to discover the mercenaries' identities. Cale and Sawyer try to escape via a secret tunnel, but find the exit rigged with explosives. They escape in the [[Official state car|presidential limo]] but are chased by Stenz and fall into the White House pool. With Sawyer and Cale presumed dead in an explosion in the cabana, the [[Twenty-fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|25th amendment]] is invoked; Hammond is sworn in as president. Cale and Sawyer, still alive, learn Hammond has ordered an aerial incursion to re-acquire the White House, but the mercenaries shoot down the helicopters. Learning Emily's identity from the video, Stenz takes her to Walker in the [[Oval Office]]. Hacking into [[North American Aerospace Defense Command|NORAD]], Tyler launches a laser-guided missile at Air Force One from [[Piketon, Ohio]], killing Hammond and everyone on board. Raphelson is sworn in as president and orders an air strike on the White House.\n\nSawyer surrenders himself to save Emily. Walker, blaming Iran rather than Sawyer for Kevin's death, demands Sawyer use the football to launch nuclear missiles against various Iranian cities. Sawyer refuses, while Cale sets fire to several rooms as a diversion. Tyler inadvertently triggers the tunnel explosives and is vaporized. Killing most of the mercenaries and freeing the hostages with the help of tour guide Donnie Donaldson, Cale fights against Stenz and blows him up with a grenade belt. Sawyer attacks Walker, but in the fight Walker uses Sawyer's handprint to activate the football and shoots Sawyer, much to Emily's fury. Before Walker can finally launch the missiles from the {{USS| Albuquerque|SSN-706|6}}, Cale crashes a reinforced [[Chevrolet Suburban]] into the Oval Office and kills him with the car's [[rotary cannon]]. Emily runs outside and waves off the incoming fighter planes with a presidential flag, calling off the air strike. Sawyer survives thanks to a pocket watch once belonging to [[Abraham Lincoln]] that stopped Walker's bullet.\n\nWith Finnerty's help, Cale realizes that Raphelson was the one who gave Walker the launch codes, having acted at the behest of the corrupt [[military\u2013industrial complex]]. Believing Sawyer dead and that Cale will never be believed, Raphelson is tricked into confessing and arrested for [[treason]] when Sawyer appears and thus removing Raphelson from the position of President. Sawyer names Cale his new special agent and takes him and Emily on an aerial tour of DC on [[Marine One]], aboard which he receives word that [[France]], [[Iran]], [[Israel]] and [[Russia]] have agreed to his peace deal after learning of the events at the White House, calling for an end to all wars.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Channing Tatum]] as John Cale, an [[War in Afghanistan (2001 - present)|Afghanistan]] veteran and [[United States Capitol Police|Capitol policeman]] who gets his daughter tickets to a special White House tour but they get trapped in the middle of an attack.<ref name=\"tatum\">{{cite journal | last=Kit | first=Borys | url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/channing-tatum-white-house-down-324079 | title=Channing Tatum in Talks to Star in 'White House Down' | journal=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date=May 14, 2012 }}</ref>\n* [[Jamie Foxx]] as James Sawyer, [[President of the United States]], who is the main target of an attack on the White House.<ref name=\"foxx\">{{cite journal | last1=Sneider | first1=Jeff | last2=Kroll | first2=Justin | url=https://www.variety.com/article/VR1118055125?refCatId=13 | title=Foxx nominated for 'White House Down' | journal=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date=June 6, 2012 }}</ref>\n* [[Maggie Gyllenhaal]] as Carol Wilkes Finnerty, [[United States Secret Service|Secret Service]] Presidential Detail Deputy Special Agent-in-Charge.<ref name=\"gyllenhaal\">{{cite journal | last1=Sneider | first1=Jeff | last2=Kroll | first2=Justin | url=https://www.variety.com/article/VR1118055170 | title=Maggie Gyllenhaal joins 'White House' staff | journal=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date=June 7, 2012 }}</ref>\n* [[Jason Clarke]] as Emil Stenz, an ex-[[Delta Force]] and [[CIA]] operative who leads a group of mercenaries in infiltrating and taking over the White House.<ref>{{cite news | last=Patten | first=Dominic | url=https://www.deadline.com/2012/08/roland-emmerich-white-house-down-jason-clarke-roland-emmerich-channing-tatum-jamie-foxx-movie-casting/ | title=Roland Emmerich's 'White House Down' Adds Jason Clarke To Cast | website=[[Deadline Hollywood]] | date=August 2, 2012 }}</ref>\n* [[Richard Jenkins]] as Eli Raphelson, a corrupt [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives]], who briefly assumes the Presidency after Sawyer is predicted dead and after his Vice President dies during an attack on Air Force One.<ref name=\"jenkins\">{{cite journal | last1=Sneider | first1=Jeff | last2=Kroll | first2=Justin | url=https://www.variety.com/article/VR1118056625 | title=Richard Jenkins joins 'White House Down' | journal=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date=July 16, 2012 }}</ref>\n* [[Joey King]] as Emily Cale, the daughter of John Cale.<ref name=\"king\">{{cite journal | last=Sneider | first=Jeff | url=https://www.variety.com/article/VR1118057015?refcatid=13 | title=Joey King 'Down' to play Tatum's daughter | journal=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date=July 24, 2012 }}</ref>\n* [[James Woods]] as Martin Walker, a rogue Secret Service Presidential Detail Special Agent-in-Charge, and the leader of the attack on the White House.<ref name=\"woods\">{{cite journal | last=Kroll | first=Justin | url=https://www.variety.com/article/VR1118056355?refCatId=13 | title=James Woods in talks for 'White House Down' | journal=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date=July 9, 2012 }}</ref>\n* [[Nicolas Wright]] as Donnie Donaldson, White House Tour Guide.\n* [[Jimmi Simpson]] as Skip Tyler, an ex-[[National Security Agency|NSA]] cyber-security analyst turned hacker and the technical specialist in Stenz's group.\n* [[Michael Murphy (actor)|Michael Murphy]] as Alvin Hammond, [[Vice President of the United States]] who briefly assumes the Presidency after Sawyer is claimed dead.
