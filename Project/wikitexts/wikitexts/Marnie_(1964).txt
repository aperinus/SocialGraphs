The screenplay by [[Jay Presson Allen]] was based on the 1961 [[Marnie|novel of the same name]] by writer [[Winston Graham]]. The film stars [[Tippi Hedren]] and [[Sean Connery]].\n\nThe music was composed by [[Bernard Herrmann]], his last of seven critically acclaimed [[film score]]s for Hitchcock. ''Marnie'' also marked the end of Hitchcock's collaborations with [[cinematographer]] [[Robert Burks]] (his 12th film for Hitchcock) and [[Film editing|editor]] [[George Tomasini]] (who died later in the year).\n\n==Plot==\nMarion Holland flees with nearly $10,000 she stole from the company safe of her employer, Sidney Strutt, the head of a [[Tax advisor|tax consulting]] company, whom she charmed into hiring her without references. Changing her appearance and identity, Marian, whose real name is Margaret \"Marnie\" Edgar, travels to Virginia, where she stables a horse named Forio. She then visits her invalid mother, Bernice, whom she supports financially, in [[Baltimore]].\n\nMark Rutland, a wealthy widower who owns a [[Publishing|publishing company]] in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]], meets with Strutt on business. He learns about the theft and recalls Marnie from a previous visit. Some months later, Marnie, posing as Mary Taylor, applies for a job at Mark's company. Mark hires her after recognizing her. While working weekend overtime with Mark, Marnie has a panic attack during a [[thunderstorm]]. Mark comforts, then kisses her. They begin dating. Marnie suffers from bad dreams, and the color [[Chromophobia|red]] can [[Trauma trigger|trigger]] an extreme emotional reaction.\n\nSoon after, Marnie steals money from Mark's company and flees again. Mark tracks her to the stable where she keeps Forio. He blackmails her into marrying him, much to the chagrin of Lil, the sister of Mark's late wife, who is in love with him. Lil grows suspicious when she discovers Mark has spent a considerable sum since marrying Marnie.\n\nOn their honeymoon cruise, Marnie resists Mark's desire for physical intimacy. Mark initially respects her wishes, but then rapes her.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://www.newyorker.com/culture/richard-brody/marnie-is-the-cure-for-hitchcock-mania |title=\"Marnie\" Is the Cure for Hitchcock Mania |first=Richard |last=Brody |authorlink=Richard Brody |date=August 17, 2016 |magazine=[[The New Yorker]]}}</ref> The next morning, she attempts to drown herself in the ship's swimming pool, but Mark saves her.\n\nAfter overhearing Marnie on a phone call, Lil tips off Mark that Marnie's mother is not dead, as Marnie claimed. Mark hires a private detective to investigate. Meanwhile, Lil overhears Mark telling Marnie he has \"paid off Strutt\" on her behalf. Lil mischievously invites Strutt and his wife to a party at the Rutland mansion. Strutt recognizes Marnie, but Mark pressures him into doing nothing. When Marnie later admits to additional robberies, Mark works to reimburse her victims to drop charges.\n\nMark brings Forio to their estate, pleasing Marnie. During a [[fox hunt]], a red riding coat triggers another of Marnie's fits and Forio bolts, misses a jump, breaks a leg, and is left lying on the ground screaming in pain. Marnie frantically runs to a nearby house, obtains a gun, and shoots her horse. Crazed with grief, Marnie goes home, where she finds the key to Mark's office. She goes to the office and opens the safe, but finds herself unable to take the money, even after Mark arrives and \"urges\" her to take it.\n\nMark takes Marnie to Baltimore to confront her mother and extract the truth about Marnie's past. They arrive in a thunderstorm. As it is revealed that Bernice was a prostitute, Marnie's long-suppressed memories resurface: when she was a small child, one of Bernice's clients tried to calm a frightened Marnie during a thunderstorm. Seeing him touch Marnie and believing he was trying to molest her, Bernice attacked him. As the man fended her off, she fell and injured her leg, leaving her disabled. Marnie, frightened and attempting to protect her mother, fatally struck the man in the head with a fireplace poker. The sight of his blood caused her hatred of the color red, the thunderstorm that night caused her fear of them, and the connection of the deadly night to sex caused her revulsion at physical intimacy. In the aftermath, Bernice told police that she killed the man and prayed Marnie would forget the event. Understanding the reason behind her behavior, Marnie asks for Mark's help. They leave holding each other closely.\n\n==Cast==\n[[Image:Marnie2.jpg|thumb|270px|right|Mark and Marnie on their honeymoon cruise.]]\n* [[Tippi Hedren]] as Margaret \"Marnie\" Edgar\n* [[Sean Connery]] as Mark Rutland\n* [[Diane Baker]] as Lil Mainwaring, Mark's former sister-in-law\n* [[Martin Gabel]] as Sidney Strutt, Marnie's ex-boss\n* [[Louise Latham]] as Bernice Edgar, Marnie's mother\n* [[Bob Sweeney (director)|Bob Sweeney]] as Mark's Cousin Bob\n* [[Alan Napier]] as Mr. Rutland, Mark's father\n* [[Mariette Hartley]] as Susan Clabon, Marnie's co-worker\n* [[Bruce Dern]] as the sailor from Marnie's childhood\n* [[Meg Wyllie]] as Mrs. Turpin\n* [[Kimberly Beck]] as Jessica \"Jessie\" Cotton, whom Bernice babysits (uncredited)\n* [[Melody Thomas Scott]] as Young Marnie (uncredited)\n* [[List of Alfred Hitchcock cameo appearances|Alfred Hitchcock's cameo]] can be seen five minutes into the film, entering from the left of a hotel corridor after Marnie passes by.\n\n==Production==\n=== Development and writing ===\nAlfred Hitchcock began developing the film adaptation of [[Winston Graham]]'s novel ''[[Marnie]]'' in 1961. He commissioned [[Joseph Stefano]], the screenwriter of Hitchcock's recently released ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'', to work on the script. Stefano made extensive notes and wrote a 161-page [[Film treatment|treatment]].<ref name=\"derosa199\">{{harvnb|De Rosa|2001|p=199}}</ref> The director's first choice to play the title role, [[Grace Kelly]], by then Princess Grace of Monaco, withdrew from the project when the citizens of Monaco objected to her appearing in a film, especially as a sexually disturbed thief. Also, when Kelly married [[Prince Rainier]] in 1956, she had not fulfilled her contract with [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]], which could have prevented her from working for another studio. As a consequence of Kelly's departure from the film, Hitchcock put it aside to work on ''[[The Birds (film)|The Birds]]'' (1963).<ref name=\"derosa199\"/>\n\nAfter completing ''The Birds'', Hitchcock returned to the Winston Graham adaptation. Stefano dropped out of the project due to his commitments to the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] television series ''[[The Outer Limits (1963 TV series)|The Outer Limits]]''.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|title=AFI{{!}}Catalog|url=https://catalog.afi.com/Film/22380-MARNIE?cxt=filmography|access-date=2021-10-03|website=catalog.afi.com}}</ref> [[Evan Hunter]], who had written the screenplay for ''The Birds'', developed ''Marnie'' with Hitchcock, and wrote several drafts. Hunter was unhappy with the rape scene in the original novel, as he felt the audience would lose sympathy for the male lead. The director, however, was enthusiastic about the scene, describing to Hunter how he intended to film it:\n\n<blockquote>Hitch held up his hands the way directors do when they're framing a shot. Palms out, fingers together, thumbs extended and touching to form a perfect square. Moving his hands toward my face, like a camera coming in for a close shot, he said, \"Evan, when he sticks it in her, I want that camera right on her ''face''\".<ref name=\"hunter35\">{{harvnb|Hunter|1997|p=35}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nHunter wrote a draft containing the rape scene but also wrote an additional, substitute sequence, which he pleaded with Hitchcock to use instead. Hunter was dismissed from the project on 1 May 1963.<ref>{{harvnb|Hunter|1997|p=37}}</ref> His replacement, [[Jay Presson Allen]], later told him that \"you just got bothered by the scene that was his reason for making the movie. You just wrote your ticket back to New York\".<ref name=\"hunter35\"/><ref>{{harvnb|Gottlieb|Brookhouse|2002|pp=204\u201305}}</ref> Just as Hunter had been unaware of Stefano's earlier work on ''Marnie'', Presson Allen was not informed that she was the third writer to work on the adaptation.<ref name=\"derosa199-200\">{{harvnb|De Rosa|2001|pp=199\u2013200}}</ref>\n\n=== Casting ===\nAccording to royal biographer Craig Brown, Hitchcock offered [[Princess Grace]] the title role in March 1962, and she accepted; but in Monaco, the reaction to the announcement was categorically negative. As he wrote: \"Monegasques did not like the idea of their princess being filmed kissing another man. Little did they know that Hitchcock also had plans for him to rape her\". The film was also being developed during a tense period of [[France\u2013Monaco relations]] in which France threatened to revoke Monaco's special status, leaving the ruling [[House of Grimaldi|Grimaldi dynasty]] anxious to preserve the country's public image.<ref name=\":0\" /> Grace's announcement that she would donate her $800,000 fee to Monaco charities did nothing to appease the critics, and she dropped out of the project in June 1962.<ref>{{cite web |last=Brown |first=Craig |title=Can This Marriage Be Saved?

Hitchcock also considered two other actresses who were, like Hedren, under his personal contract, [[Vera Miles]] and Claire Griswold, wife of director/actor [[Sydney Pollack]]. [[Eva Marie Saint]], star of Hitchcock's ''[[North by Northwest]]'' (1959), and [[Susan Hampshire]] unsuccessfully pursued the role as well. In the end, Hitchcock opted to use Tippi Hedren, a one-time model he had seen in a commercial for a diet drink in 1961, then cast successfully in ''The Birds''. According to Hedren, he offered her the role of Marnie during filming of ''The Birds''. Hedren told writer Moral that she was \"amazed\" that Hitchcock would offer her this \"incredible role\", calling it a \"once-in-a-lifetime opportunity\". In 2005, more than 40 years after the film's release, Hedren declared in an interview that ''Marnie'' was her favorite of the two films that she made with Hitchcock, because of the intriguing, complex, challenging character that she played.<ref>{{cite web | first= Leon | last=Worden| url= http://www.scvhistory.com/scvhistory/signal/newsmaker/sg030605.htm | title= SCV Newsmaker of the Week: Tippi Hedren | publisher= Santa Clarita Valley Historical Society | access-date=2005-03-05}}</ref>\n\nMale lead Sean Connery had been worried that being under contract to [[Eon Productions]] for both [[James Bond]] and non-Bond films would limit his career and turned down every non-Bond film that Eon offered him. When asked what he wanted to do, Connery replied that he wanted to work with Alfred Hitchcock, which Eon arranged through their contacts.<ref>{{harvnb|Broccoli|Zec|1999|}}</ref> Connery also shocked many people at the time by asking to see a script, something that Connery did because he was worried about being typecast as a spy and he did not want to do a variation of ''[[North by Northwest]]'' or ''[[Notorious (1946 film)|Notorious]]'', spy-themed movies directed by Hitchcock starring [[Cary Grant]]. When told by Hitchcock's agent that Grant did not ask to see even one of Hitchcock's scripts Connery replied, \"I'm not Cary Grant\".<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,875552,00.html?promoid=googlep |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121023135316/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,875552,00.html?promoid=googlep |url-status=dead |archive-date=October 23, 2012 |title=Canny Scot |magazine=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=January 10, 1964}}</ref> Hitchcock and Connery got on well during filming.

It was the last time a \"Hitchcock blonde\" would have a central role in one of his films. It was also the final occasion when he would work with several of his key team members: director of photography [[Robert Burks]], who died in 1968; editor [[George Tomasini]], who died soon after ''Marnie'''s release, and music composer [[Bernard Herrmann]], who was fired during Hitchcock's next film, ''[[Torn Curtain]]'' (1966), when Hitchcock and Universal studio executives wanted a more contemporary \"pop\" tune for the film.\n\n''Marnie'' continues to have its admirers. Actress [[Catherine Deneuve]] indicated that she would have loved to have played Marnie.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://film.guardian.co.uk/interview/interviewpages/0,,1577158,00.html |title=Catherine Deneuve |work=The Guardian |last=Andrew |first=Geoff |author-link=Geoff Andrew |date=September 21, 2005 |access-date=5 May 2018}}</ref> Actress [[Naomi Watts]] dressed up as Hedren's Marnie (whose outfits were by [[Edith Head]]) for the March 2008 issue of ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' magazine.<ref>[http://www.cinematical.com/media/2008/02/hitch12-(2).jpg ''Vanity Fair'' photograph]</ref>\n\nAlthough they played mother and daughter, Latham (42) was only eight years older than Hedren (34). In the script, the mother character was only 15 years older than the daughter character.\n\n=== Filming ===\nIn a making-of documentary for the DVD release, unit manager Hilton A. Green explains that shooting had been scheduled to begin on November 25, 1963, at [[Universal Studios Hollywood|Universal City Studios]] in [[California]] but had to be postponed because the nation was in mourning for [[John F. Kennedy]], who had been [[Assassination of John F. Kennedy|assassinated]] three days before. Filming concluded on March 14, 1964.\n\n=== Music ===\nHitchcock had noticed a strong similarity between Herrmann's score for ''[[Joy in the Morning (film)|Joy in the Morning]]'' and ''Marnie'' and believed that Herrmann was repeating himself.<ref>{{harvnb|Smith|1991|p=268}}</ref> Herrmann's music for ''Marnie'' included excerpts in his special album for [[Decca Records]]. Lyrics were written to Herrmann's theme that were to be sung by [[Nat King Cole]]. Herrmann's later score for Truffaut's ''[[The Bride Wore Black (film)|The Bride Wore Black]]'' (1968) also repeats the main theme in Marnie, although slightly altered in its harmony.\n\n[[File:Marnie (1964) trailer.webm|thumb|thumbtime=279|Theatrical trailer.]]\n\n==Reception==\n{{Anchor|Box office}}\nContemporary reviews were mixed. Eugene Archer of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote a lukewarm assessment, calling it \"at once a fascinating study of a sexual relationship and the master's most disappointing film in years\". Archer's main criticisms were \"an inexplicably amateurish script\" and the casting of \"relative newcomers\" Hedren and Connery in roles that \"cry for the talents of [[Grace Kelly]] and [[Cary Grant]]\".<ref>{{cite journal |last=Archer |first=Eugene |date=July 23, 1964 |title=Hitchcock's 'Marnie', With Tippi Hedren and Sean Connery |journal=[[The New York Times]] |page=19}}</ref> A review in ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' wrote that the opening was slow, but once it got going Hitchcock's story \"generally keeps the action fairly fast-paced\u2014provided audience can overlook certain puzzling aspects, such as why the lady became a thief\u2014and gets strong performances from his two stars and other cast members\".<ref>{{cite journal |date=June 10, 1964 |title=Film Reviews: Marnie |journal=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |page=6}}</ref> Philip K.
