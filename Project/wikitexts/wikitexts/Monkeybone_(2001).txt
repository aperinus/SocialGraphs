The film combines [[live-action]] with [[Stop motion|stop-motion animation]].\n\nLoosely based on Kaja Blackley's [[graphic novel]] ''[[Dark Town]]'', the film stars an [[ensemble cast]] led by [[Brendan Fraser]], [[Bridget Fonda]], and [[Whoopi Goldberg]] with [[Rose McGowan]], [[Dave Foley]], [[Giancarlo Esposito]], [[Megan Mullally]], [[Lisa Zane]], [[Chris Kattan]], [[Bob Odenkirk]], an uncredited [[Thomas Haden Church]], and the voice of [[John Turturro]].\n\nTheatrically released on February 23, 2001 by [[20th Century Fox]], the film was a [[box-office bomb]] and received generally negative critical reviews.<ref>{{cite news|title=Why \"Monkeybone\" flopped at the box office|author=Rebecca Ascher-Walsh|publisher=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|url=http://www.ew.com/article/2001/03/09/why-monkeybone-flopped-box-office}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nStuart \"Stu\" Miley is a disillusioned cartoonist whose comic character, a rascal [[monkey]] named Monkeybone, is getting an [[animated series]] and numerous merchandise, at the constant pestering of his agent and friend, Herb. He plans on proposing to his girlfriend, Julie McElroy, a sleep institute worker who helped him deal with his nightmares by changing his drawing hand, but one night, Stu falls into a coma following a car crash before he can do so. His spirit is taken to Down Town, a surreal and carnival-themed [[limbo]]-like landscape populated by mythical beings and figments of its visitors' imaginations, even Monkeybone. Stu and Monkeybone are constantly at each other\u2019s throats during his time in Down Town until discovering people can leave Down Town once they are given Exit Passes. Stu is then invited to a party being hosted by the God of Sleep and ruler of Down Town [[Hypnos]].\n\nAccording to Hypnos, Stu has to steal an Exit Pass from his sister, Death, in order to return wake up from his coma in time before the plug is pulled due to Stu and his sister Kimmy making a pact as children after their father\u2019s death. Stu and Monkeybone journey to Death's domain disguised as one of her employees and successfully manage to steal an Exit Pass, while narrowly escaping a nightmare Julie inflicts upon Stu in an attempt to wake him by using \u201cOneirix\u201d, a chemical solution made by Julie that causes nightmare inducement to living creatures.\n\nBack in Down Town, Monkeybone steals the Exit Pass for himself, where it is revealed that the theft was part of a plan orchestrated by Hypnos. Monkeybone enter Stu\u2019s body while Stu is imprisoned with other disillusioned or criminal figures throughout history such as [[Stephen King]], [[Attila the Hun]], [[Jack the Ripper]] and [[Lizzie Borden]]. Hypnos reveals to Stu that he desires more nightmares to gain power and made a deal with Monkeybone to spread the Oneirix amongst the living in exchange for getting Monkeybone his body to have a life of his own, having been fed up with being a figment.\n\nMonkeybone is ordered by Hypnos via a nightmare to stay his course, causing Monkeybone to steal the Oneirix from the sleep institute successfully, leaving a decoy in its place. Monkeybone puts the chemical in farting Monkeybone toys to be given out to the public at a charity banquet, Julie growing weary due to \u201cStu\u2019s\u201d new behavior. Stu manages to escape with the help of Miss Kitty, a [[catgirl]] waitress he befriends and confronts Death in order to convince her to send him to back to the living world to stop Monkeybone. Death complies, giving him an hour to do so by putting him in the body of an organ donor with a broken neck.\n\nStu makes it to the banquet while Monkeybone is about to propose to Julie after Herb is exposed to the Oneirix in the Monkeybone doll and sees his clothes coming to life in a mirror, causing him to strip naked and flees in panic. Stu finally confesses his love and regrets to Julie for never getting a chance to propose to her. Stu manages to use Monkeybone\u2019s origin characteristics to cause him to panic which culminates in the two of them battling one another on a giant Monkeybone balloon, which is soon shot down by a police officer, causing the duo to fall from the sky and back into Down Town.\n\nBack in Down Town, the citizens below cheer on Stu and Monkeybone's fight as they descend from the sky before being caught by a giant robot controlled by Death. Monkeybone is then placed back in Stu\u2019s mind by Death, claiming it is where he belongs before she sends Stu back to his proper body. Once Stu is, he and Julie reunite and share a kiss as the still-infected Herb emerges from a nearby fountain and telling everyone to remove their clothes.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Brendan Fraser]] as Stuart \"Stu\" Miley, a cartoonist and the creator of the ''Monkeybone'' franchise.

Selick fell in love with the book and vigorously pursued the rights. In a letter to Kaja, he wrote: \"I've never felt any project was closer to my sensibilities than this one.\" The initial intention was to stay true to the source material, which can be seen in early designs from Selick's company, Twitching Image. However, as the project developed, it eventually evolved into ''Monkeybone''.<ref>{{cite web|title=June 1997 News|url=https://www.awn.com/mag/issue2.3/issue2.3pages/news2.3.html|website=www.awn.com|access-date=23 January 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Casting===\nInitially the role of Stuart \"Stu\" Miley was to be played by [[Ben Stiller]] but Stiller dropped out to be in ''[[Mystery Men]]'' and was replaced by Fraser.<ref>{{cite web|last=Petrikin|first=Chris|title= Fraser up to 'Monkey' biz |url=https://variety.com/1999/film/news/fraser-up-to-monkey-biz-1117490355/|website=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=January 18, 1999|access-date=June 30, 2021|language=en}}</ref>\n\n===Influences===\nMuch of the film's art bears a strong resemblance to that of [[Mark Ryden]]\u2014for example, the bust of [[Abraham Lincoln]] as \"The Great Emancipator\".
