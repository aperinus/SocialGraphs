First, he wants to tie up some loose ends. He moves in with his brother Lucky and his family, and confronts his elderly seventh grade teacher, who made his life hell - even though she is suffering from dementia in a home for the elderly. He meets her granddaughter Greta. He confides his plan to her and she takes an interest. She wants to document his life leading up to his suicide. He then confronts his childhood bully, Rawly, who apologizes for the way he treated Ted  and wants to make amends. He finds out that his wife died of an [[aneurysm]], leaving him behind with a [[mentally disabled]] child. They become friends. He sleeps with his high school crush Vickie, who is married with five children. She leaves her family for him, but he eventually tells her he doesn't want a relationship, which hurts her deeply. Ted's nephew Zeke [[coming out|comes out]] to him as [[gay men|gay]] and confides that he is afraid that his father would disown him if he knew. Ted comforts Greta after her grandmother dies, and she tries to kiss him. He backs away, however, reminding her that he will be dead soon. She gets angry, and accuses him \"running away\". He learns her mother committed suicide, which is why she was interested in his story. After a violent argument with his secret boyfriend, Zeke goes to kill himself by jumping off a cliff. Ted and the rest of the family try to talk him down, but he slips and falls off the cliff. Ted and Lucky jump after him, saving the boy's life.  Ted is knocked unconscious, and has a dream in which his long-dead father tells him how important living is. With a new lease on life, Ted decides to stay in town, with Greta, and surrounded by his family and friends, both old and new.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Seann William Scott]] as Ted Morgan\n* [[Olivia Thirlby]] as Greta\n* [[Garret Dillahunt]] as Lucky Morgan\n* [[Kate Walsh (actress)|Kate Walsh]] as Kathleen Morgan\n* [[Kyle Gallner]] as Zeke Morgan\n* [[Rob Riggle]] as Rawly Stansfield\n* [[Evan Ross]] as Romeo Semple\n* [[Cleo King]] as Berta\n* [[Missi Pyle]] as Officer CT\n* [[Elisha Cuthbert]] as Penny Morgan\n* Mackenzie Marsh as Vickie\n* [[Connie Stevens]] as Nancy Morgan\n* [[David Arquette]] as Albert, Vickie's husband\n* [[Clancy Brown]] as Ted's father\n* [[Jack Quaid]] as Dylan\n\n==Release==\nThe premiere took place at the 2014 [[Tribeca Film Festival]].<ref name=premiere/> The film was released in [[Limited release|select theaters]] on April 24, 2015, before a [[video on demand]], digital store, [[DVD]] and [[Blu-ray]] release on May 12, 2015.<ref name=HollywoodLife/>\n\n==Reception==\n[[Rotten Tomatoes]], a [[review aggregator]], reports that 9% of 11 surveyed critics gave the film a positive review; the average rating was 1.9/10.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/just_before_i_go/|title=Just Before I Go (2015)|work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|accessdate=October 19, 2022}}</ref> [[Metacritic]] rated it 24/100 based on six reviews.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/just-before-i-go|title=Just Before I Go|work=[[Metacritic]]|accessdate=October 19, 2022}}</ref>\n\nJustin Chang of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' called it \"a dismal, tonally disastrous small-town farce\".<ref name=variety>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2015/film/reviews/just-before-i-go-review-courteney-cox-seann-william-scott-1201480211/|title=Film Review: 'Just Before I Go'|last=Chang|first=Justin|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=April 26, 2015|accessdate=April 27, 2015}}</ref> Frank Scheck of ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' described it as \"a serious misfire\" whose tonal shifts would be difficult for a veteran director to manage.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/just-before-i-go-tribeca-699041|title=Just Before I Go: Tribeca Review|last=Scheck|first=Frank|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=April 25, 2014|accessdate=April 27, 2015}}</ref> Ethan Alter of ''[[Film Journal International]]'' wrote, \"Cox must have seen something in this screenplay that encouraged her to film it, but whatever that critical element was, it\u2019s not apparent in the finished product.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.filmjournal.com/reviews/film-review-just-i-go|title=Film Review: Just Before I Go|last=Alter|first=Ethan|work=[[Film Journal International]]|date=April 23, 2015|accessdate=April 27, 2015}}</ref> [[Stephen Holden]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote that the film \"lurches along a wobbly line between salacious comic nastiness and nauseating sentimentality\" without properly integrating them into a cohesive whole.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/24/movies/review-in-courteney-coxs-just-before-i-go-a-settling-of-accounts.html?_r=0|title=Review: In Courteney Cox's 'Just Before I Go,' a Settling of Accounts|last=Holden|first=Stephen|authorlink=Stephen Holden|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=April 23, 2015|accessdate=April 27, 2015}}</ref> Joe Neumaier of the ''[[Daily News (New York)|New York Daily News]]'' wrote: \"Courteney Cox's misbegotten project is a comedy-drama that, to Cox's credit, doesn't feel at all like a TV sitcom.
