Murray Abraham]], [[Courtney B. Vance]], [[Yojiro Noda]], [[Fisher Stevens]], [[Mari Natsuki]], [[Nijiro Murakami]], [[Yoko Ono]], [[Harvey Keitel]], and [[Frank Wood (actor)|Frank Wood]]. A U.S.\u2013German co-production, ''Isle of Dogs'' was produced by [[Indian Paintbrush (production company)|Indian Paintbrush]] and Anderson's own production company, American Empirical Pictures, in association with [[Babelsberg Studio|Studio Babelsberg]]. The film is set in the fictional retro-futuristic [[Japan]]ese city of Megasaki, where Mayor Kenji Kobayashi has banished all dogs to Trash Island due to a canine influenza pandemic. Kobayashi\u2019s nephew Atari sets out to find his missing dog Spots with the help of a group of dogs led by stray dog Chief.\n\nAnderson starts developing the film in October 2015 about dogs from stop-motion animation art form, with the voice cast of Norton, Cranston and Balaban were included. It draws inspiration of films by [[Akira Kurosawa]] and [[Hayao Miyazaki]], as well as the [[stop motion|stop-motion]] animated holiday specials made by [[Rankin/Bass Productions]], the 1982 animated film ''[[The Plague Dogs (film)|The Plague Dogs]]'' and [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]]'s ''[[101 Dalmatians (1961 film)|101 Dalmatians]]''. Production began in October 2016 at the [[3 Mills Studios]] in East London. By December 2016, [[Fox Searchlight Pictures]] acquired worldwide distribution rights to the film, scheduling for a 2018 release.\n\n''Isle of Dogs'' opened the [[68th Berlin International Film Festival]], where Anderson was awarded the [[Silver Bear for Best Director]]. It was given a limited release in the United States on March 23, 2018, by Fox Searchlight Pictures, and went on wide release on April 13. It has grossed over $64 million worldwide, and received acclaim from critics, who praised its animation, story, musical score, and deadpan humor. A [[manga]] adaptation of the film by [[Minetar\u014d Mochizuki]] was published in 2018, beginning with the May 24 issue of ''[[Morning (magazine)|Weekly Morning]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://natalie.mu/comic/news/283507|title=\u671b\u6708\u30df\u30cd\u30bf\u30ed\u30a6\u300c\u72ac\u30f6\u5cf6\u300d\u30b3\u30df\u30ab\u30e9\u30a4\u30ba\u304c\u30e2\u30fc\u30cb\u30f3\u30b0\u3067\u59cb\u52d5\u3001\u8868\u7d19\u306f\u5927\u53cb\u514b\u6d0b|trans-title=Minetar\u014d Mochizuki \"Inugashima\" comicalize starting in ''Morning'', cover is Katsuhiro \u014ctomo|date=May 24, 2018|website=[[Natalie (website)|Natalie]]|access-date=July 20, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=''Dragon Head''{{'}}s Minetar\u014d Mochizuki draws ''Isle of Dogs'' manga |author=Rafael Antonio Pineda |url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2018-04-20/dragon-head-minetaro-mochizuki-draws-isle-of-dogs-manga/.130621 |publisher=[[Anime News Network]] |date=April 20, 2018 |access-date=July 21, 2018}}</ref> The film received nominations at the [[76th Golden Globe Awards]], [[72nd British Academy Film Awards]], and two nominations at the [[91st Academy Awards]], for [[Academy Award for Best Animated Feature|Best Animated Feature Film]] and [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Best Original Score]], but lost to both ''[[Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse]]'' (which also starred Schreiber) and ''[[Black Panther (film)|Black Panther]]'' respectively.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 2038, an outbreak of [[canine influenza|canine flu]] spreads throughout [[Japan]] including the (fictitious) city of Megasaki with the risk of becoming contagious to humans. The city's [[authoritarian]] mayor, Kenji Kobayashi, ratifies an official decree banishing all dogs to Trash Island, which is immediately approved despite the insistence of Professor Watanabe, the mayor's political opponent, who states he is close to creating a cure. The first deported canine is a white and black-spotted dog named Spots Kobayashi, who served as the [[bodyguard]] dog of 12-year-old [[orphan]] Atari Kobayashi, the mayor's distant nephew and [[Ward (law)|ward]]. In this film, none of the [[Japanese language|Japanese]] dialogue spoken by human characters is translated in the movie except through an interpreter or occasional subtitles.\n\nSix months later, Atari hijacks a plane and flies it to Trash Island (now nicknamed \"Isle of Dogs\") to search for Spots. After crash-landing, Atari is rescued by a dog pack ostensibly led by an all-black canine named Chief, a lifelong stray. With their help, Atari first finds a locked cage that apparently contains Spots' skeleton, but learns that it is not him. They then fend off a rescue team sent by Kobayashi to retrieve Atari. Atari decides to continue his search for Spots, and the pack decides to help him. Chief initially declines, but is then convinced by Nutmeg, a female ex-[[show dog]], to help the boy out of obligation. The pack seeks advice from sage-like dogs Jupiter and Oracle, who surmise that Spots might be held captive by an isolated tribe of dogs rumored to be [[Cannibalism|cannibals]].\n\nMeanwhile, Watanabe finally develops a successful serum and shows the results to Kobayashi, who only dismisses him. The professor objects, only to be put under [[house arrest]] and killed by a piece of poisoned [[sushi]] by order of the mayor's [[Hatchet man (idiom)|hatchet man]], [[Majordomo|Major Domo]]. Tracy Walker, an [[Americans|American]] [[Student exchange program|exchange student]] and member of a pro-dog activist group, suspects a conspiracy and begins to investigate. In the process of investigating, she gains feelings for Atari. Kobayashi and his political party are revealed to be actually responsible for the dog flu outbreak, seeking to eliminate the dogs as Kobayashi's cat-loving ancestors tried to do 1,000 years ago, who were foiled by a child [[samurai]] resembling Atari.\n\nDuring their journey, Chief and Atari are separated from the others. Atari gives Chief a bath, revealing his white and black-spotted coat and thus his striking resemblance to Spots. The two bond and rejoin the rest of the pack, and are saved by Spots and the dog tribe from another rescue team. Spots confirms that he is Chief's older brother and that he was rescued by the tribe, who were test subjects from a secret lab that was abandoned after a [[tsunami]]. Spots became their leader and mated with a female tribe member named Peppermint, who is pregnant with their first litter. Because of these circumstances, Spots requests for Atari to transfer his protection duties to Chief. Chief is initially hesitant, but both he and Atari accept, and bodyguard duties are officially transferred to Chief. An [[owl]] later brings word that Kobayashi has rounded up all the exiled dogs and plans to exterminate them with poison gas.\n\nTracy confronts Watanabe's closest colleague [[Yoko Ono]], who confirms Tracy's conspiracy theories and gives her the last vial of serum. At his re-election ceremony, Kobayashi prepares to give the extermination order when Tracy presents her evidence of his corruption. Kobayashi proceeds to deport Tracy, but before he can do so, Atari and the dogs arrive. They confirm the serum works by testing it on Chief and curing him. Atari addresses the crowd and recites a ''[[haiku]]'' he wrote and dedicated to Kobayashi, rekindling the sympathy that once existed between dogs and humans. Touched by Atari's words, Kobayashi officially rescinds the dog ban. Enraged, Major Domo yells at Mayor Kobayashi for breaking the Mayor's campaign promise and tries to kill Kobayashi and initiate the extermination himself, but thanks to Spots and the activists, Domo's plans are thwarted. Atari and Spots become gravely injured during the struggle and are taken to a hospital, where Kobayashi donates one of his [[kidney]]s to save his nephew. It is later revealed that while Kobayashi did win the election, he won't hold office because he was caught in a scandal. Therefore, all mayoral powers and authorities will transfer to his next-in-line, Atari.\n\nOne month later, Atari officially becomes the new mayor of Megasaki, and has all dogs reintegrated into society and cured of the dog flu, while Kobayashi and his propagandists and co-conspirators are sent to jail for political corruption, doing 30 days of community service, and paying fines of no less than \u00a5250,000 while Major-Domo faces a possible death sentence. Tracy and Atari become a couple, while Chief and Nutmeg become their bodyguard dogs and begin a relationship. Meanwhile, Spots (recovering from his injuries) has had a statue erected in his honor and resumes raising his litter with Peppermint under the care of a priest at a [[Shinto]] temple.\n\n==Cast==\n<!-- Cast order and character names now match the BFI page. -->\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Bryan Cranston]] as Chief, a [[stray dog]]\n* Koyu Rankin as Atari Kobayashi, the nephew of mayor Kobayashi who is on a search for his dog Spots \n* [[Edward Norton]] as Rex\n* [[Bob Balaban]] as King\n* [[Jeff Goldblum]] as Duke\n* [[Bill Murray]] as Boss, a mascot of a baseball team\n* [[Kunichi Nomura]] as Mayor Kenji Kobayashi, the mayor of Megasaki\n* [[Akira Takayama]] as Major Domo, the minion of Mayor Kobayashi\n* [[Greta Gerwig]] as Tracy Walker, an American [[foreign student exchange|foreign exchange]] student from [[Cincinnati]], [[Ohio]].\n* [[Frances McDormand]] as Interpreter Miranda Nelson, a news reporter working in Megasaki<ref name=\"BFI\" />\n* Akira Ito as Professor Ichigo Watanabe, the professor whose canine flu antidote was rejected by Mayor Kobayashi\n* [[Scarlett Johansson]] as Nutmeg, a [[show dog]] and Tracy Walker\u2019s dog\n* [[Liev Schreiber]] as Spots, an Oceanic speckle-eared-sport hound mix, the first dog to be transported to Trash Island\n* [[F.

This is a sly subversion, in which the Japanese evince an agency independent of foreign validation.
