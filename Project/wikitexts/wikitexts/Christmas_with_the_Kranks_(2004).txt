It was directed by [[Joe Roth]], written and produced by [[Chris Columbus (filmmaker)|Chris Columbus]], and starring [[Tim Allen]], [[Jamie Lee Curtis]], [[Dan Aykroyd]], [[Erik Per Sullivan]], [[Cheech Marin]], [[Jake Busey]], and [[M. Emmet Walsh]]. The film tells of a couple who decide to skip Christmas one year since their daughter is away, much to the chagrin of their neighbors until their daughter decides to come home at the last minute. This was [[Tom Poston]]'s final film before his death in 2007.\n\n==Plot==\nAfter [[Riverside, Illinois]] couple Luther and Nora Krank see their daughter, Blair, depart for a [[Peace Corps]] assignment in [[Peru]] on the Sunday following [[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving]], and [[empty nest syndrome]] sets in. Luther calculates that he and Nora spent $6,132 during the previous year's holiday season, and, not looking forward to celebrating Christmas without their daughter, he suggests they invest the money usually spent on decorations, gifts, and entertainment and treat themselves to a ten-day [[Caribbean Sea|Caribbean]] cruise instead. Luther insists that they completely boycott the holidays, and eventually Nora agrees.\n\nThe Kranks are amazed to discover they are considered [[Pariah state|pariahs]] as a result of their decision to skip the holidays. Those who are most vocal in their objections are neighbors Vic Frohmeyer and Walt Scheel. Vic, who is the self-proclaimed leader of the street, organizes a campaign to force the Kranks to decorate their home. Walt does not seem to like Luther, so his efforts are primarily personal. However, it is revealed that Walt's wife Bev is suffering from [[cancer]], perhaps dampening his holiday spirits. Children, led by Vic's son Spike, constantly force them to put up a Frosty the Snowman decoration, and [[Christmas carol]]ers try to revive the Kranks' holiday spirit by singing on their lawn, which Luther stops by freezing his front lawn. Even the newspaper gets into the act by publishing a front-page story complete with a photograph of the unlit Krank house. Still, Luther and Nora continue to stand their ground. Luther's office colleagues, scout tree salesmen, and police fund collectors are also annoyed.\n\nThe two are in the process of packing on Christmas Eve morning when they receive a call from Blair, who announces that she is at [[Miami International Airport]], en route home with her Peruvian fianc\u00e9 Enrique as a surprise for her parents. When Blair asks if they are having their usual party that night, a panicked Nora says yes. Comic chaos ensues as Luther and Nora find themselves trying to decorate the house and coordinate a party with only twelve hours to spare before their daughter and future son-in-law arrive.\n\nWhile Nora scrambles to find food, Luther goes to buy a tree, but is unable to get anything but a small, dried-up tree that quickly loses what few leaves it has. Luther then attempts to borrow the tree of neighbor Wes Trogdon (who is going away for a week with family to visit his in-laws) with the warning that he is not to break a single ornament or damage it. Luther enlists Spike's help to transport the tree across the street, but the neighbors spot him and, assuming he is stealing the tree, they call the police. Spike comes to Luther's rescue by showing that Luther has Trogdon's keys, and thus was given permission to borrow the tree. Nora comes home, having only been able to obtain smoked trout, and orders Luther to put up Frosty on the roof of their house, which fails miserably when he and Frosty fall off the roof.\n\nOnce it is established why Luther is trying frantically to decorate his home, the neighbors, led by Vic, come out in full force to help him and Nora ready it for Blair. Blair calls to say she landed from Miami, and the neighbors send the police to pick her up and stall long enough to let everyone finish setting up. The party starts off strong, with Blair having no idea of the earlier drama. Enrique thanks everyone for the warm welcome, and Nora thanks her neighbors for being a strong community. Luther, to everyone's disappointment, offers only a half-hearted toast. When Nora confronts Luther, he tries to convince her to still go on the cruise, but Nora refuses, disgusted that he is not happy that Blair is home. Having a change of heart, Luther slips out of the house and goes across the street to the Scheel home. Bev's cancer, once in [[Remission (medicine)|remission]], has returned and, knowing this may be their last holiday together, Luther insists they take the cruise in place of him and Nora, going so far as to offer to take care of their cat, Muffles, to allow them to go. At first Walt and Bev decline, but ultimately decide to accept his generosity. Luther, whose holiday spirit has been renewed, finally admits that skipping Christmas was not a good idea, with Nora suggesting they should maybe do it next year.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Tim Allen]] as Luther Krank\n* [[Jamie Lee Curtis]] as Nora Krank, Luther's wife\n* [[Dan Aykroyd]] as Vic Frohmeyer, the Kranks' domineering neighbor and usually the ward boss of the neighborhood\n* Dava Hulsey as Amanda Frohmeyer, the doting wife of Vic and loving mother of Spike\n* [[Julie Gonzalo]] as Blair Krank, the Kranks' daughter\n* [[M.

He was asked by Grisham to read the book in [[Advance copy|galley form]], assuming he could direct a movie based on it. Roth recalls: \"It turns out he was right. Even while I was reading it, all I could think was that this would make a great Christmas movie. It had humor, it had wonderful characters and it had heart.\" With the rights of the book received and the May 2000 founding of [[Revolution Studios]], he stated that \"as a start-up company, there was a great deal of work to do in order to get up and running.\"<ref name = \"Hollywood Jesus\">{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodjesus.com/movie/christmas_kranks/notes.pdf|title=Christmas with the Kranks|website=Hollywood Jesus|access-date=October 12, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924031033/http://www.hollywoodjesus.com/movie/christmas_kranks/notes.pdf|archive-date=September 24, 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nLater, filmmaker [[Chris Columbus (filmmaker)|Chris Columbus]], who also bought the rights to ''Skipping Christmas'' and had written a screenplay, called Roth about directing the adaptation. As Roth explains: \"Naturally, I thought he was going to direct it. But he said, 'No, you should direct it.' It turns out I was getting ready to direct another project. But when I read Chris's script, I knew I had to at least try to direct it. I promised myself that if I could get the right cast in place, I would do it.\" Producer [[Michael Barnathan]] said, \"Joe read the script on a Sunday, bought it on Monday, decided he wanted to direct it on Tuesday and by Friday had cast Tim [Allen] and Jamie Lee [Curtis]. The following Monday morning we started pre-production.\"<ref name = \"Hollywood Jesus\"/>\n\n===Setting===\n''Christmas with the Kranks'' takes place mostly in the Kranks' neighborhood of Hemlock Street in [[Riverside, Illinois|Riverside]], a [[suburb]] of [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]], over the course of four weeks from Thanksgiving to Christmas Eve. Production designer Garreth Stover originally looked for locations with the right weather conditions and suburban ambience for Hemlock Street, as described specifically in Columbus's script of the film. He was scouting from the [[metropolitan area]] of Chicago to [[Minnesota]], but due to the extreme conditions of this part of the United States at the time, the filmmakers felt it was better to set up the neighborhood in an empty location instead of finding one.<ref name = \"Hollywood Jesus\"/>\n\nWhen looking for a place to build the set 15 weeks before filming began, Stover chose a parking lot of a former [[Boeing]] aircraft factory in [[Downey, California|Downey]], [[California]], about 15 miles away from [[downtown Los Angeles]] and in the midst of [[Downey Studios]]. The rest of the first three weeks were spent on designing the houses with assistance from construction coordinator David Elliott. In the next 12 weeks, hundreds of carpenters, plasterers and painters had built what would become the largest exterior set ever for a movie, being more than 700 feet long and including 16 houses. What Stover called \"the core five\" were the houses of the Kranks, the Frohmeyers, the Scheels, the Beckers and the Trogdons, which he claimed had \"full ground floors that are dressed and you can see into.\" He also said that the second floor of the Kranks' was built on a soundstage. Producer [[Michael Barnathan]] claimed that the set would later be available for other movies, TV series and commercials to use.<ref name = \"Hollywood Jesus\"/>{{dead link|date=December 2018}} However, due to both health complaints from the locals over toxic residues and a lack of profit, the studio closed in 2012 and was razed to build a mall.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2009/aug/02/business/fi-ct-downey2|title=Health complaints linked to former NASA site in Downey|last=Verrier|first=Richard|date=2009-08-02|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=2017-02-28|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035}}</ref>\n\nThe scenes involving Nora Krank's excursion to the supermarket to procure a \"Mel's Hickory Honey Ham\" were filmed at Cordons Ranch Market, located at 2931 Honolulu Ave, Glendale, California.\n\n===Costumes===\nSusie DeSanto handled the costume design of ''Christmas with the Kranks''. According to DeSanto, \"I was looking for a project that was really textural, and maybe a bit nostalgic. I saw ''Christmas with the Kranks'' like a Christmas card, a beautiful Christmas memory of how we wish the holiday to be. So a lot of the fabrics I chose were not so much high-tech bright colors, but wools, plaids and mixing patterns. Joe [Roth] was specific about what he wanted, but within that, he allowed me a great deal of freedom to express myself. However he did not have any impute on the tan segment of the movie where Luthor and Nora Krank were wearing colourful underwear to look their best for the cruise\"<ref name = \"Hollywood Jesus\"/>{{dead link|date=December 2018}}\n\nDeSanto viewed that all the characters in ''Christmas with the Kranks'' would wear dresses that are supposed to serve as their \"accents\" rather than overtly defining them. Luther Krank is seen wearing the same-colored shirt and suit at work all the time, and according to DeSanto, this \"tells that Luther's a punch-the-clock kind of guy, so the whole idea of skipping Christmas and going off on a tropical vacation is completely averse to anything he's ever done.\" She described Nora as \"tasteful and kind of folksy, a middle-American woman approaching middle age. In our first meeting, Jamie Lee Curtis was totally prepared. She wanted to look like a real Midwestern woman who lives in the suburbs of Chicago and is as obsessed with Christmas as everyone around her. Nora dresses for the seasons and I found out by speaking to people at Marshall Field's in Chicago that the Christmas sweater is a big deal. And Jamie wears it so well.\" As for Vic Frohmeyer, she saw him as \"a sort of commander-in-chief of the neighborhood, so I wanted something with a bit of a military flair. Since he's also a college professor, we cut the pattern from a general's jacket and made it professorial by using a vintage tweed mixed with corduroy.\"<ref name = \"Hollywood Jesus\"/>\n\n===Music===\n{{Infobox album\n| name       = Christmas with the Kranks: Music from the Motion Picture\n| type       = Soundtrack\n| artist     = Various Artists\n| cover      =\n| alt        =\n| released   = November 23, 2004\n| genre      = [[Christmas music]], [[Garage rock]]\n| length     = 37:03\n| label      = [[Hollywood Records|Hollywood]]\n| producer   = [[Steven Van Zandt|Little Steven]]\n}}\n{{Album ratings\n| rev1      = [[AllMusic]]\n| rev1Score = {{Rating|3.5|5}}<ref name=\"allmusic.com\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/christmas-with-the-kranks-music-from-the-motion-picture-mw0000141733|title=Christmas with the Kranks: Music from the Motion Picture - Original Soundtrack {{!}} Songs, Reviews, Credits {{!}} AllMusic|website=AllMusic|access-date=2018-11-25}}</ref>\n| rev2      = ''[[The Irish Times]]''\n| rev2Score = {{Rating|3|5}}<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/culture/soundtrack-1.1169536|title=SOUNDTRACK|work=The Irish Times|access-date=2018-11-25|language=en-US}}</ref>\n}}\n\nThe [[soundtrack]] was produced and supervised by American musician [[Steven Van Zandt]], who arranged and produced 6 of the tracks.<ref name=\"allmusic.com\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/christmas-with-the-kranks-music-from-the-motion-picture-mw0000141733|title=Christmas with the Kranks: Music from the Motion Picture - Original Soundtrack {{!}} Songs, Reviews, Credits {{!}} AllMusic|website=AllMusic|access-date=2018-11-25}}</ref> It features many holiday [[Standard (music)|standards]], including \"[[Jingle Bell Rock]]\" by [[Brenda Lee]]; \"[[Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer (song)|Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer]]\" by [[Billy May]] & His Orchestra with vocal by [[Alvin Stoller]]; \"[[I Saw Mommy Kissing Santa Claus]]\" by Eddie Dunstedter; \"[[White Christmas (song)|White Christmas]]\" by [[Dean Martin]]; \"[[Frosty the Snowman]]\" by [[Steven Van Zandt|Steve Van Zandt]]; \"[[Blue Christmas (song)|Blue Christmas]]\" by [[Elvis Presley]]; and \"[[The Christmas Song]]\" by [[Ella Fitzgerald]].\n\nUnlike the movie, the soundtrack received generally favorable reviews, with many critics appreciating the use of garage rock as a \"fresh take\" on Christmas music.
