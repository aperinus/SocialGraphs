It received positive critical reviews, and its dance scene has been referenced several times in popular culture.\n\n==Plot==\nA young woman named Odile ([[Anna Karina]]) meets a man named Franz ([[Sami Frey]]) in an English language class. She has told him of a large pile of money stashed in the villa where she lives with her aunt Victoria and Mr. Stolz in [[Joinville-le-Pont|Joinville]], a Parisian suburb. Franz tells his friend Arthur ([[Claude Brasseur]]) of the money, and the two make a plan to steal it.\n\nFranz and Arthur go to the English class, where Arthur flirts with Odile and asks her about the money. Odile goes home and finds the money in Stolz's room. She then meets Franz and Arthur, and they go to a caf\u00e9, order drinks, and dance. Odile tells Arthur that she loves him, and the two go back to his place and spend the night together.\n\nThe next day, Arthur's uncle learns of the money and wants a cut of it. Franz, Arthur, and Odile decide to commit the robbery sooner than they planned. The three meet up and run through the [[Louvre]] in record time. That night, they go to Odile's house and find that the door to Stolz's room is locked. Arthur tells Odile to find the key. Franz and Arthur return to the house the following night, and Odile tells them that the locks have been changed. They tie and gag Victoria, before locking her in a closet. Then, they go to Stolz's room and see that the money is not there anymore. They search the house and find only a small amount of cash. When they open the closet to interrogate Victoria, she appears to be dead. Franz and Odile leave, and Arthur stays behind.\n\nWhile driving away, Franz and Odile see Arthur's uncle heading to the villa, and they go back. They then see that Arthur has found the rest of the money in a doghouse. Arthur and his uncle get into a shootout and kill each other. Stolz returns to the house, and Victoria is shown to be alive. Franz and Odile drive off with the small stack of money from the robbery. They flee to South America and realize that they love each other.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Anna Karina]] as Odile<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>ACTRICES</small>\n*Dani\u00e8le Girard as English teacher\n*[[Louisa Colpeyn]] as Madame Victoria\n*Chantal Darget as Arthur's aunt\n\n\n*[[Sami Frey]] as Franz\n*[[Claude Brasseur]] as Arthur<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>ACTEURS</small>\n*[[Georges Staquet]] as legionnaire\n*Ernest Menzer as Arthur's uncle\n\n==Production==\n''Bande \u00e0 part'' was directed by Jean-Luc Godard and was filmed in 25 days.<ref name=\"DVD\">Criterion Collection DVD book</ref> Godard described it as \"''[[Alice in Wonderland]]'' meets [[Franz Kafka]]\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1964/09/19/archives/film-festival-new-wave-at-its-crest-woman-is-a-woman-is-best-so-far.html|last=Archer|first=Eugene|title=Film Festival: New Wave at Its Crest|work=[[The New York Times]] |date=19 September 1964 |access-date=18 July 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\nFilm critic [[Pauline Kael]] described ''Bande \u00e0 part'' as \"a reverie of a gangster movie\" and \"perhaps Godard's most delicately charming film\".<ref>{{cite news |title=Godard Among the Gangsters|work=[[The New Republic]]|author-link=Pauline Kael|last=Kael|first=Pauline|date=10 September 1966|access-date=17 July 2017| url=https://newrepublic.com/article/93946/godard-among-gangsters}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.filmforum.org/archivedfilms/bandpress.html |title=Jean-Luc Godard's Band of Outsiders |work=[[Film Forum]] |publisher=The Moving Image |url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080719062937/http://www.filmforum.org/archivedfilms/bandpress.html |archive-date=19 July 2008 |access-date=18 July 2018}}</ref> ''Bande \u00e0 part'' is often considered one of Godard's most accessible films; [[Amy Taubin]] of the ''[[Village Voice]]'' called it \"a Godard film for people who don't much care for Godard\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.villagevoice.com/film/0133,taubin,27251,20.html |last=Taubin |first=Amy |title=Prime Movers |work=[[The Village Voice]] |date= 15 August 2001 |access-date=18 July 2018}}</ref> Its accessibility has endeared the film to a broader audience.

The final scene of the movie is a longer reenactment in a caf\u00e9 after one of the characters plays the music on a jukebox. The entire dance scene was also used as the music video for the song \"Dance with Me\" by [[Nouvelle Vague (band)|Nouvelle Vague]] from their album ''[[Bande \u00e0 Part (album)|Bande \u00e0 Part]]'' (2006).

The narrator informs viewers that their time was 9 minutes and 43 seconds, which broke the record set by Jimmy Johnson of San Francisco at 9 minutes and 45 seconds.
