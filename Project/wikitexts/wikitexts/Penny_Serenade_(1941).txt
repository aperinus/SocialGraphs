Grant was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Actor]] for his performance.\n\n==Plot==\n[[File:Penny Serenade (1941).webm|thumb|left|thumbtime=20|''Penny Serenade'' (1941)]]\nThe film charts the meeting, courtship and marriage of Julie Gardiner ([[Irene Dunne]]) and Roger Adams ([[Cary Grant]]) through the playing of popular songs relevant to each time period. After their spur-of-the-moment marriage on New Year's Eve and a night in Roger's train compartment en route to [[San Francisco]], a pregnant Julie rejoins Roger in [[Tokyo]], where he has a stint as a reporter. Julie loses their unborn child in the [[1923 Great Kant\u014d earthquake|1923 Tokyo earthquake]]<ref name=wlrn>{{cite web |url=https://www.wlrn.org/post/love-endures-all-penny-serenade#stream/0|title=Love endures all in Penny Serenade|first=Mia|last=Laurenzo|date=January 30, 2019|access-date=February 23, 2020|work=[[WLRN-FM]]}}</ref> and returns with Roger to California despondent, until their friend Applejack Carney ([[Edgar Buchanan]]) encourages them to adopt a child. While Roger struggles to keep a newspaper going in the fictional California town of Rosalia, Julie keeps house and fits out the nursery.\n\nThey apply at an adoption agency for a two-year-old boy, and receive a call from Miss Oliver ([[Beulah Bondi]]) that a five-week-old baby girl is available. Though Roger would have preferred a boy, he falls in love with the baby, and he and Julie care for her during their one-year probation period. At the end of that time Roger has lost the newspaper, and the law will not allow him to adopt the baby without an income. Roger appears before the judge and delivers an impassioned plea to keep the girl, whom he considers his own. The judge awards custody, and Roger returns home to Julie with their daughter.\n\nYears later, Roger and Julie swell with pride as their daughter, Trina, not yet old enough to play an angel in the Christmas play, plays the \"echo\" instead. The following Christmas, Julie writes to Miss Oliver that Trina has died from a sudden illness. The child's death sends Roger into a deep depression, and Julie resolves to leave him, believing he no longer needs her. Just as she is about to leave for the train station, the couple receive a phone call from Miss Oliver, saying that a two-year-old boy has just become available for adoption. Roger and Julie embrace, ready to rebuild their marriage with a new child.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Irene Dunne]] as Julie Gardiner (Adams)\n* [[Cary Grant]] as Roger Adams\n* [[Beulah Bondi]] as Miss Oliver\n* [[Edgar Buchanan]] as Applejack Carney\n* [[Ann Doran]] as Dotty \"Dot\"\n* [[Eva Lee Kuney]] as Trina (age 6)\n* Leonard Willey as Doctor Hartley\n* [[Wallis Clark]] as Judge\n* Walter Soderling as Billings\n* Jane Biffle (listed as \"Baby Biffle\" in end-credits) as Trina (age 1)\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Penny Serenade 4.jpg|right|thumb|Grant and Dunne with Baby Biffle in a scene from the film]]\n\n===Development=== \nFor $25,000, Columbia Pictures purchased the rights to a story by [[Martha Cheavens]] published in ''[[McCall's]]'' and engaged Cheavens as script consultant.<ref name=afi>{{cite web |url=https://catalog.afi.com/Catalog/moviedetails/27033|title=Penny Serenade (1941)|work=[[American Film Institute]] Catalog|year=2020|access-date=February 23, 2020}}</ref> [[Morrie Ryskind]] was credited for the screenplay.\n\nThe film depicts the passage of time through the playing of songs. According to [[George Stevens]]' papers stored at the [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] library, Stevens kept close track of the chronology of the songs to accurately match them to the different time periods in the script. These songs include \"[[The Japanese Sandman]]\", \"[[These Foolish Things (Remind Me of You)|These Foolish Things]]\", \"[[1927 in music|Just a Memory]]\", \"[[Three O'Clock in the Morning]]\", \"[[Ain't We Got Fun]]\", and \"[[The Prisoner's Song]]\".<ref name=afi/>\n\n===Casting===\n''Penny Serenade'' is the third of three films pairing Grant and Dunne, each time playing a married couple.<ref name=wlrn/>\n\nAt the time, California law restricted the time an infant could be present in a film studio to two hours per day; during that time, the infant could be kept on a sound stage for only one hour, and be filmed under the studio lights for only twenty minutes at a time. To double the amount of time he could film the character of Trina both as a baby and as a one-year-old, Stevens hired identical twin girls for Trina at each age.<ref name=afi/> The baby was played by Judith and Dianna Fleetwood, and the one-year-old by Joan and Jane Biffle.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/46695206/the-des-moines-register/|title=Film briefs|newspaper=[[The Des Moines Register]]|date=January 12, 1941|page=51|via=[[Newspapers.com]]}}{{open access}}</ref>\n\n===Filming===\nFilming took place from October 14, 1940 to January 15, 1941.<ref name=afi/>\n\n==Release==\nThe film was released on April 24, 1941.<ref name=afi/>\n\n==Critical reception==\n[[File:Cary Grant-Irene Dunne in Penny Serenade.jpg|thumb|right|Grant and Dunne in ''Penny Serenade'']]\nOn the film review website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], ''Penny Serenade'' receives a \"Fresh\" rating with 93% (15 of 16) of its T-meter critics reviewed the film positively.<ref>[http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/penny_serenade Penny Serenade].

[[Edgar Buchanan]], too, gives an excellent performance as a good-old-Charlie friend, and [[Beulah Bondi]] is sensible as an orphanage matron. Heart-warming is the word for both of them.
