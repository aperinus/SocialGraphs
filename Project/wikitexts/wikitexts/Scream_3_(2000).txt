It stars [[Neve Campbell]], [[David Arquette]], [[Courteney Cox]], [[Parker Posey]], [[Patrick Dempsey]], [[Scott Foley]], [[Lance Henriksen]], [[Matt Keeslar]], [[Jenny McCarthy]], [[Emily Mortimer]], [[Deon Richmond]], and [[Patrick Warburton]]. Released as the third installment in the [[Scream (franchise)|''Scream'' franchise]], it was originally the concluding chapter of the series until the franchise was revived in 2011 with a sequel, ''[[Scream 4]].''\n\nThe film takes place three years after the [[Scream 2|previous film]] and follows [[Sidney Prescott]] (Campbell), who has gone into self-imposed isolation following the events of the previous two films but is drawn to [[Hollywood, Los Angeles|Hollywood]] after a new [[Ghostface (identity)|Ghostface]] begins killing the cast of the [[film within a film]] ''Stab 3''. ''Scream 3'' combines the violence of the slasher genre with comedy and \"[[whodunit]]\" mystery, while satirizing the [[clich\u00e9]] of [[Trilogy|film trilogies]]. Unlike the previous ''Scream'' films, there was an increased emphasis on comedic elements in this installment; the violence and horror were reduced in response to increased public scrutiny about violence in media, following the [[Columbine High School massacre]].\n\n''Scream'' screenwriter [[Kevin Williamson (screenwriter)|Kevin Williamson]] provided a five-page outline for two sequels to ''Scream'' when auctioning his original script, hoping to entice bidders with the potential of buying a franchise. Williamson's commitments to other projects meant he was unable to develop a complete script for ''Scream 3'', so writing duties were undertaken by Kruger, who discarded many of Williamson's notes. Craven and [[Marco Beltrami]] returned to direct and score the film, respectively. Production was troubled with script rewrites, occasions when pages were only ready on the day of filming, and scheduling difficulties with the main cast. Principal photography took place from July to September 1999, and the ending was re-filmed in January 2000.\n\n''Scream 3'' premiered on February 3, 2000, in [[Westwood, Los Angeles]], and was theatrically released the following day, grossing $162{{nbsp}}million worldwide on a budget of $40{{nbsp}}million. The film received mixed reviews, and is often cited as the weakest installment of the series.<ref>{{Cite web|url = https://www.forbes.com/sites/scottmendelson/2022/01/13/all-5-scream-movies-ranked-from-worst-to-best-neve-campbell-courtney-cox/?sh=ff94ebd8c167|title = All 5 'Scream' Movies Ranked from Worst to Best|website = [[Forbes]]|access-date = January 18, 2022|archive-date = August 16, 2022|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20220816000346/https://gum.criteo.com/syncframe?origin=publishertag&topUrl=www.forbes.com|url-status = live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url = https://screenrant.com/scream-movies-tv-show-ranking-worst-best/|title = Every Scream Movie & TV Show Ranked, from Worst to Best|website = [[Screen Rant]]|date = December 14, 2021|access-date = January 18, 2022|archive-date = January 27, 2022|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20220127205053/https://screenrant.com/scream-movies-tv-show-ranking-worst-best/|url-status = live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url = https://www.denofgeek.com/movies/scream-ranking-the-movies-in-order-of-quality/|title = Scream: Ranking the Movies in Order of Quality|date = October 19, 2016|access-date = January 18, 2022|archive-date = January 18, 2022|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20220118182928/https://www.denofgeek.com/movies/scream-ranking-the-movies-in-order-of-quality/|url-status = live}}</ref>\n\n== Plot ==\n[[List of Scream (film series) characters#Cotton Weary|Cotton Weary]], now the host of a successful talk show, is contacted by [[Ghostface (identity)|Ghostface]] on his car phone. The voice demands to know the whereabouts of [[Sidney Prescott]]. When Cotton refuses to cooperate, Ghostface breaks into his home and attacks his girlfriend [[List of Scream (film series) characters#Christine Hamilton|Christine]]. Cotton rushes home only for Christine to think he was behind the attack. As he tries to reason with her, Ghostface kills Christine, then Cotton, telling him he should have revealed Sidney's location.\n\nDetective [[List of Scream (film series) characters#Mark Kincaid|Mark Kincaid]] contacts [[Gale Weathers]] to discuss the recent murders, prompting her to travel to [[Hollywood, Los Angeles|Hollywood]], where she finds [[List of Scream (film series) characters#Dewey Riley|Dewey Riley]] working as an adviser on the set of ''Stab 3'', the third film in the series based on the Ghostface murders. Ghostface kills ''Stab 3'' actress [[List of Scream (film series) characters#Sarah Darling|Sarah Darling]], causing production of ''Stab 3'' to be halted. The remaining ''Stab 3'' cast, along with Dewey and Gale, gather at the home of [[List of Scream (film series) characters#Jennifer Jolie|Jennifer Jolie]]. Ghostface murders her bodyguard and uses a gas leak to cause an explosion, which kills fellow actor [[List of Scream (film series) characters#Tom Prinze|Tom Prinze]].\n\nSidney is living in seclusion as a [[crisis intervention|crisis counselor]] for an abused women's [[hotline]], fearing that another killer may strike. Having discovered Sidney's location, the killer begins taunting her by phone using a [[voice changer]] to sound like her deceased mother [[List of Scream (film series) characters#Maureen Prescott|Maureen Prescott]], forcing her out of hiding and drawing her to Hollywood.\n[[List of Scream (film series) characters#Martha Meeks|Martha Meeks]], the sister of Sidney's friend [[List of Scream (film series) characters#Randy Meeks|Randy]] who was [[Scream 2|murdered while Sidney was in college]], visits Sidney and the others to deliver a videotape that Randy made before his death, posthumously warning them that the rules of a horror film do not apply to anyone in the third and final film of a horror trilogy and that any of them, including \"main character\" Sidney, could die. Sidney is later attacked by Ghostface at a movie set, forcing the police to keep Sidney safe at their station. \n\nDewey, Gale, Jennifer, and the remaining ''Stab 3'' cast, [[List of Scream (film series) characters#Angelina Tyler|Angelina]] and [[List of Scream (film series) characters#Tyson Fox|Tyson]], attend a birthday party for ''Stab 3''{{'}}s director, [[List of Scream (film series) characters#Roman Bridger|Roman Bridger]]. After Gale discovers Roman's body in the basement, Ghostface attacks the group, seemingly murdering Angelina when she wanders off alone{{efn|In the [[director's commentary]], Angelina is revealed to have been the second killer; the scene revealing her survival and allegiances was cut, with [[Wes Craven]] elaborating that an earlier scene in the film where Sidney came across Angelina wearing Ghostface gear in her dressing room, which Angelina had passed off as due to just having come off of set, was Sidney unknowingly actually having caught Angelina in the act of changing into her Ghostface gear. Craven left it ambiguous as to whether Angelina had genuinely been betrayed and murdered by her partner after \"wandering off\" to change into her Ghostface gear or whether she was still alive; in the subsequent ''Scream Trilogy'' box set booklet written by Craven, Angelina is listed among the characters still alive after ''Scream 3''.<ref>{{cite video|people=[[Wes Craven|Craven, Wes]] (Director), [[Marianne Maddalena]] (Producer) and [[Patrick Lussier]] (Editor)|date=February 2, 2000|title=Scream 3: Commentary|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0134084|medium=DVD|publisher=[[Dimension Films]]|location=United States|access-date=August 15, 2011|archive-date=May 31, 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220531032931/https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0134084|url-status=live}}</ref>}}, and successfully kills Tyson and Jennifer. The killer then orders Sidney to the mansion to save Gale and Dewey, who are being held hostage. When Sidney arrives, Ghostface lures her inside where Gale and Dewey are bound and gagged. As Sidney is freeing them, Ghostface appears, though Sidney gains the upper hand using a hidden gun to fight him off. Kincaid shows up but is knocked unconscious by Ghostface. Sidney flees and hides in a secret screening room where she is discovered by Ghostface, who reveals himself as Roman, having survived being shot by wearing a bulletproof vest. \n\nRoman admits to being Sidney's half-brother, born to their mother Maureen when she was an actress in Hollywood. Four years prior, he had tried reuniting with her, only for her to reject him due to him being the product of rape. Bitter over the rejection, Roman began stalking her, filming all the men she philandered with and showing [[List of Scream (film series) characters#Billy Loomis|Billy Loomis]] the footage of Billy's father with Maureen, which motivated Billy and Stu Macher to kill her, thus setting off the string of murders [[Scream (1996 film)|in Sidney's hometown]] and [[Scream 2|at her college]]. When he discovered how much fame Sidney had attracted due to those events, Roman snapped and lured Sidney out of hiding, planning to kill her and frame her for the murders. After Roman kills ''Stab'' producer John Milton, who he implies is his biological father and one of their mother's rapists, Sidney furiously denounces him and his motives, provoking an enraged Roman to engage Sidney in a vicious fight, which ends when Roman shoots Sidney in the chest, but Sidney survives the shot and stabs Roman multiple times, revealing to him that she, too, was wearing a bulletproof vest. As Dewey and Gale arrive, a screaming Roman suddenly resurfaces with a knife; Sidney yells at Dewey to shoot Roman in the head, which Dewey does, finally killing him.\n\nSometime after at Sidney's house, Dewey proposes to Gale, who accepts. Sidney returns from a walk and leaves her gates, which were previously shown to be alarmed, open. She enters her home and is invited to join Dewey, Gale, and Kincaid to watch a movie. As she goes to join the others, her front door blows open behind her, but she walks away, leaving it as it is.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{Further|topic=individual characters|List of Scream (film series) characters}}\n{{Further|topic=cast members|List of Scream (film series) cast members}}\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Neve Campbell]] as [[Sidney Prescott]], a crisis counselor and main target of Ghostface\n* [[David Arquette]] as [[List of Scream (film series) characters#Dewey Riley|Dewey Riley]], a deputy and advisor on the set of ''Stab 3''\n* [[Courteney Cox-Arquette]] as [[Gale Weathers]], an investigative reporter\n* [[Parker Posey]] as Jennifer Jolie, an actress portraying a fictional Gale in ''Stab 3''\n* [[Patrick Dempsey]] as Mark Kincaid, a detective\n* [[Scott Foley]] as Roman Bridger, director of ''Stab 3''\n* [[Lance Henriksen]] as John Milton, a Hollywood producer\n* [[Matt Keeslar]] as Tom Prinze, an actor portraying a fictional Dewey in ''Stab 3''\n* [[Jenny McCarthy]] as Sarah Darling, an actress cast as Candy in ''Stab 3''\n* [[Emily Mortimer]] as Angelina Tyler, an actress portraying a fictional Sidney in ''Stab 3''\n* [[Deon Richmond]] as Tyson Fox, an actor portraying a fictional Randy substitute called Ricky in ''Stab 3''\n* [[Kelly Rutherford]] as Christine Hamilton, Cotton's girlfriend\n* [[Liev Schreiber]] as Cotton Weary, a talk show host\n* [[Patrick Warburton]] as Steven Stone, a bodyguard\n* [[Jamie Kennedy]] as Randy Meeks, who appears in a videotape recording made in college before he was murdered\n* [[Roger L.

Craven too had been contracted for two potential sequels following a successful [[test screening]] of ''Scream'' and he returned to direct the third installment.<ref name=\"fangoria160\" /> Shortly before production began on the film, [[Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold]] killed 12 students, a teacher, and themselves at their school, in what became known as the [[Columbine High School massacre]]. In the aftermath of the incident, many parties began looking for reasoning behind their actions and there came an increased scrutiny on the role of the media in society, including [[video game]]s and film, and the influence it could have on an audience. With production of ''Scream 3'' not yet underway, there were considerations about whether the film should be made at that time, aware of the potential for negative attention but the studio decided to press forward, albeit with changes.<ref name=\"ETrueHollywoodStory\" /> The studio remained however much more apprehensive concerning violence and gore in ''Scream 3'' than with previous installments, pressing for a greater emphasis on the series' satiric humor while scaling back on the violence. At one point in the production, the studio went as far as demanding that the film feature no blood or on-screen violence at all, a drastic departure for the series, but Craven directly intervened. According to Kruger, \"[Craven ...] said 'Be serious, guys. Either we make a ''Scream'' movie or we make a movie and call it something else. But if it's a ''Scream'' movie, it's going to have certain standards.'\"<ref name=\"fangoria190\" />\n\n=== Writing ===\n[[Bob Weinstein|Bob]] and [[Harvey Weinstein]] approached Williamson in early 1999 to pursue a full script for a third installment to the ''Scream'' franchise, ''Scream 3''. However, following his successes with the ''Scream'' series and other projects such as ''[[I Know What You Did Last Summer]]'', Williamson had become involved in multiple projects including the development of the short-lived TV series ''[[Wasteland (American TV series)|Wasteland]]'' and directing his self-penned film ''[[Teaching Mrs. Tingle]]'' (1999) which Williamson had written prior to ''Scream'' and which had languished in [[development hell]] since.'<ref name=\"ETrueHollywoodStory\" /> Unable to develop a full script for the production, Williamson instead wrote a 20\u201330 page draft outline for the film that involved the return of [[Ghostface (identity)|Ghostface]] to the fictional town of Woodsboro where the \"Stab\" series, a fictional series of [[film within a film|films within a film]] that exist within the ''Scream'' universe and are based on the events of ''Scream'', would be filmed.<ref name=\"fangoria190\" /> The Weinsteins hired ''[[Arlington Road]]'' scribe [[Ehren Kruger]] to replace Williamson and helm writing duties, developing a script based on Williamson's notes.\n\nThe environment for ''Scream 3''{{'}}s development had become more complicated than with previous films. There was an increased scrutiny on the effects of violence in media and the effect it could have on the public in the aftermath of the [[Columbine High School massacre]] which occurred shortly before production would begin on the film. In addition, since the release of the original ''Scream'' films, various acts of violence had taken place which had gained notoriety and media attention when they were linked to, or blamed on, the films.<ref name=\"ETrueHollywoodStory\" /><ref name=\"controversyCBS\" /><ref name=\"controversyIndependent\" /> Eager to avoid further criticism or connection to such incidents, Williamson's notes were largely discarded as the studio insisted that the script should focus on the comedic elements of the series while significantly reducing the violence.<ref name=\"fangoria190\" /> The setting of the film was changed from Woodsboro to [[Hollywood, California|Hollywood]] upon which Kruger commented that he believed the characters should be moving to \"bigger\" places from [[high school]], to [[college]] to the city of Hollywood.<ref name=\"fangoria190\" /> Behind the scenes however, the move away from Woodsboro was mandated as it was considered that a film containing violent acts of murder in and around the small town of Woodsboro and the associated school would attract significant negative criticism and attention that could be detrimental to the production and studio, the film set for release less than a year following the Columbine incident.<ref name=\"ETrueHollywoodStory\" />\n\nKruger agreed to develop the script for ''Scream 3'' primarily to work with Craven and the executives under [[Miramax]]; he said of his decision to take on writing duties on the film:\n{{blockquote|When you're doing a rewrite script, it's never totally coming from you. It's never the same as writing an original. So often, what you look for is, \"Well who am I going to be working with?\" and \"Who am I going to be learning from?\" The [answers to those] questions give you a lot of motivation for pursuing a project like this.<ref name=\"fangoria190\" />}}\nTo help in developing the script, Kruger read copies of Williamson's scripts for ''Scream'' and ''Scream 2'', as well as watched the earlier films to better understand the characters and tone.<ref name=\"fangoria190\" /> In an interview, Kruger admitted that his lack of involvement with the development of the principal cast of ''Scream'' hampered his ability to portray them true to their previous characterization. Early scripts for ''Scream 3'' had the character of Sidney Prescott much like \"[[Sarah Connor (Terminator)|Linda Hamilton]] in ''[[Terminator 2: Judgment Day]]''\" \u2013 a more action-orientated heroine \u2013 at which point Craven would intervene and correct the script to bring the characters closer to their previous appearances.<ref name=\"fangoria190\" /> Kruger admitted that despite not receiving any writing credit, Craven had a significant hand in developing the script for ''Scream 3''.<ref name=\"fangoria190\" /> Like ''Scream 2'', the script for ''Scream 3'' was subject to repeated alterations with pages sometimes completed only on the day on which they were to be filmed.<ref name=\"scream3dvdcommentary\" /> Multiple scenes were rewritten to include previously absent characters or change elements of the plot when it was decided that they were not connecting with other scenes.<ref name=\"scream3dvdcommentary\" /> In a 2013 interview, Williamson further detailed his original script, which would have seen the killers be a \"Stab\" fan club of Woodsboro kids. All the members of the club would have been involved in the killings and the final twist \"of the movie was when Sidney walked into the house after Ghostface had killed everyone ... and they all rose up. None of them were actually dead and they'd planned the whole thing.\" Williamson later adapted this story for his 2013 TV series ''[[The Following]]''.<ref name=\"Writing2013\" />\n\n=== Casting ===\n[[Neve Campbell]], [[Courteney Cox]], [[David Arquette]], and [[Liev Schreiber]] all returned to their roles as [[Sidney Prescott]] and news reporter [[Gale Weathers]], [[List of Scream (film series) characters#Dewey Riley|Dewey Riley]], and [[List of Scream (film series) characters#Cotton Weary|Cotton Weary]], now host of a TV show, respectively for ''Scream 3'', their characters being the only central roles to survive the events of the previous two films. In an interview, Craven stated that convincing the central cast to return to film a new ''Scream'' film was not difficult but as with ''Scream 2'', their burgeoning fame and busy schedules made arranging their availability with the film's production period difficult.<ref name=\"fangoria189\" /> The consequence of Campbell's commitments in particular meant she was only available to film her role for 20 days forcing the script to reduce the series' main character to a smaller role while focusing on the other characters played by Cox and Arquette.<ref name=\"scream3dvdcommentary\" /> Lynn McCree finally makes a physical appearance in the series as Maureen Prescott (though only through an hallucination of Sidney), and Sidney now is a [[crisis intervention|crisis counselor]]. [[Roger L. Jackson]] again returned to voice the antagonist [[Ghostface (identity)|Ghostface]] and [[Jamie Kennedy]] reprised his role as [[List of Scream (film series) characters#Randy Meeks|Randy Meeks]] in spite of the character's death in ''Scream 2''. Negative feedback following the death of Randy had the production consider methods to have had his character survive to appear in ''Scream 3'' including having the character's family hide him away for safety while recuperating from his injuries, but it was deemed too unbelievable and the idea was replaced with the character appearing in a minor role via a pre-recorded video message.<ref name=\"scream3dvdcommentary\" />\n\nMany of the supporting cast played fictitious actors taking part in the [[film within a film]] ''Stab 3'' including [[Emily Mortimer]] as [[List of Scream (film series) characters#Angelina Tyler|Angelina Tyler]], [[Parker Posey]] as [[List of Scream (film series) characters#Jennifer Jolie|Jennifer Jolie]], [[Matt Keeslar]] as [[List of Scream (film series) characters#Tom Prinze|Tom Prinze]], [[Jenny McCarthy]] as [[List of Scream (film series) characters#Sarah Darling|Sarah Darling]], and [[Deon Richmond]] as [[List of Scream (film series) characters#Tyson Fox|Tyson Fox]] with [[Scott Foley]] as the film's director, [[List of Scream (film series) characters#Roman Bridger|Roman Bridger]]. Additional cast included [[Lance Henriksen]] as [[film producer]] [[List of Scream (film series) characters#John Milton|John Milton]], [[Patrick Dempsey]] as detective [[List of Scream (film series) characters#Mark Kincaid|Mark Kincaid]], [[Patrick Warburton]] as bodyguard [[List of Scream (film series) characters#Steven Stone|Steven Stone]], and [[Kelly Rutherford]] as [[List of Scream (film series) characters#Christine Hamilton|Christine Hamilton]], girlfriend to Cotton Weary. Rutherford was cast after filming had begun as the production was undergoing constant rewrites and the opening scene evolved from requiring only a female corpse to needing a live actress with whom Schreiber could interact.<ref name=\"scream3dvdcommentary\" /> Shortly after being cast, Mortimer was found to lack the necessary work permit to allow her involvement in the film, requiring her to be flown to [[Vancouver, Washington|Vancouver]] to obtain one.<ref name=\"scream3dvdcommentary\" /> ''Scream 3'' also featured the first live on-screen appearance of Sidney Prescott's mother [[List of Scream (film series) characters#Maureen Prescott|Maureen Prescott]], played by Lynn McRee, the actress previously having represented the character in photographs during the previous films.\n\nLawrence Hecht and C.W. Morgan appeared in minor roles reprising their characters of Sidney's father [[List of Scream (film series) characters#Neil Prescott|Neil Prescott]] and Hank Loomis respectively. [[Nancy O'Dell]] appeared as an unnamed reporter, having previously appeared in ''Scream 2'' and would go on to appear in ''[[Scream 4]]'' in the same role. ''Scream 3'' featured several cameo appearances including the fictional characters of [[Jay and Silent Bob]] from the 1994 film ''[[Clerks (1994 film)|Clerks]]'' played by [[Jason Mewes]] and [[Kevin Smith]], and director [[Roger Corman]] as an on-set studio executive. [[Carrie Fisher]] made a cameo in the film as former actress Bianca Burnette at the suggestion of [[Bob Weinstein]]; Fisher helped to write her character.<ref name=\"scream3dvdcommentary\" />\n\nIn a 2009 interview, [[Matthew Lillard]], who played [[List of Scream (film series) characters#Stu Macher|Stu Macher]] in ''Scream'', said that he had been contracted to reprise his role in ''Scream 3'' as the primary antagonist, having survived his apparent death, orchestrating new Ghostface attacks from prison on high school students and ultimately targeting Sidney.<ref name=\"stuscream3\" /><ref name=\"stuscream3B\" /> Following the [[Columbine High School massacre]] shortly before production began, the script was scrapped and re-written without his character and this plot to avoid development of a film which associated violence and murder with a high school setting.<ref name=\"ETrueHollywoodStory\" />\n\n=== Filming ===\n[[Principal photography]] for ''Scream 3'' began on July 6, 1999 in and around [[Hollywood, Los Angeles]] on a budget of $40{{nbsp}}million and finished on September 29, 1999 after twelve weeks.<ref name=\"ETrueHollywoodStory\" /> Filming took place largely in the areas of [[San Fernando Valley]], [[Macarthur Park]], [[Beverly Hills]], [[Hollywood Hills]] and [[Silver Lake, Los Angeles, California|Silver Lake]]<ref name=\"scream3filmlocations\" /> with the isolated home of Campbell's character situated in [[Topanga, California|Topanga Canyon]].<ref name=\"scream3filmlocations\" /> The opening scene involves [[List of Scream (film series) characters#Cotton Weary|Cotton Weary]] (Schreiber) driving before arriving home where he is murdered by the [[Ghostface (identity)|Ghostface]] character. For the driving scene, the production filmed on [[Hollywood Boulevard]]<ref name=\"scream3filmlocations\" /> but the following scene in Cotton's apartment was changed frequently, requiring alterations to the driving scene to maintain [[Continuity (fiction)|continuity]], modifying who speaks to Cotton by phone and what the conversation entailed. Unable to return to Hollywood Boulevard, the scene was reshot on a street outside of the production studio in San Fernando Valley and intermixed with footage taken on the Boulevard.<ref name=\"scream3dvdcommentary\" /> The opening attack scene was filmed partially at the exterior and interior of Harper House in [[West Hollywood, California|West Hollywood]]<ref name=\"scream3filmlocations\" /> but changes were made to the scene including introducing a live girlfriend for Cotton instead of her being dead when Cotton arrives.<ref name=\"scream3dvdcommentary\" /> It was later decided that the confrontation between Cotton and Ghostface, featuring Cotton physically dominating the character and attempting to escape by [[Daylighting#Skylights|skylight]], was unrealistic and made Ghostface appear weak and this scene was reshot.<ref name=\"scream3dvdcommentary\" /> Again however, they were unable to return to Harper House to conduct filming and resorted to constructing a replica of the apartment interior to produce the necessary footage which had the Ghostface character appear more dominant and completely excised the attempted skylight escape.<ref name=\"scream3dvdcommentary\" /> Cox's character is introduced during a seminar which takes place within a [[classroom]] at [[UCLA]], a location previously used in ''Scream 2'' to represent the fictional Windsor College.<ref name=\"scream3filmlocations\" /><ref name=\"scream2dvdcommentary\" /> The [[film studio]] where the fictional ''Stab 3'' is filmed is represented by the [[CBS Studio Center]] in [[Studio City, Los Angeles|Studio City]], San Fernando Valley while scenes at the home of Posey's character were filmed in the [[Hollywood Hills]] at Runyon Ranch in [[Runyon Canyon Park]].<ref name=\"scream3filmlocations\" /> The finale, featuring the final attacks of the film and confrontation between the antagonist and Sidney, was filmed at the [[Canfield-Moreno Estate]], a mansion in Silverlake.<ref name=\"scream3filmlocations\" />\n\nA scene in the film involved Campbell being pursued by Ghostface through [[Set construction|filmset]] replicas of locations from the original ''[[Scream (1996 film)|Scream]]'' including her character's home. The scene was not present in the script itself but Craven paid to have the sets constructed, knowing he wanted to revisit the original film in some manner. After the construction of the sets, the scene was then written around the resulting areas producing the scene in the final film.<ref name=\"scream3dvdcommentary\" /> The script underwent changes repeatedly as filming was conducted with pages regularly only available on the day of filming.<ref name=\"scream3dvdcommentary\" /> Additionally, if the production decided to change a scene this sometimes meant refilming other scenes to maintain continuity requiring further rewrites. The production team purposely filmed large amounts of footage containing different variations of each scene based on the different script developments in order that, should the script further change, they would ideally have a scene they could use without having to film new ones at a later date, requiring them to obtain access to locations or build sets. The opening scene in particular had several alternate versions filmed, initially altering the girlfriend of Schreiber's character from dead to alive, resulting in the prior driving scene being changed to alter dialog and tone to make sense with the changes. Additionally, a three-minute scene featuring the character of Randy Meeks had over two hours of footage filmed.<ref name=\"scream3dvdcommentary\" /> The script for the film was so in flux that the epilogue scene was filmed with three variants of Patrick Dempsey's character \u2013 one with him absent, one where his arm is [[bandage]]d and one with him in a normal condition \u2013 as the production were not certain what his ultimate fate would be following the finalization of the film.<ref name=\"scream3dvdcommentary\" />\n\n=== Post-production ===\nIn January 2000, three months after completing principal photography for ''Scream 3'', the ending was refilmed when it was decided to be an inadequate conclusion.<ref name=\"scream3dvdcommentary\" /> Originally the ending consisted of Sidney (Campbell) easily defeating Roman (Scott Foley) which led into an early morning scene of police arriving and then into the final scene of Sidney in her home.<ref name=\"scream3dvdcommentary\" /> The production considered that this amounted to essentially three endings, damaging the pacing of the film and there was also consideration that, being the concluding chapter of the trilogy, the audience needed to believe that Sidney could lose and die, something her easy victory did not achieve.<ref name=\"scream2dvdcommentary\" /><ref name=\"behindthescreamdocu\" /> To create the alternate ending, the fight scene between Sidney and Roman was extended and an addition involved Roman shooting Sidney, seemingly to death where previously she had simply hidden from the character. A major addition was the presence of the character [[List of Scream (film series) characters#Mark Kincaid|Mark Kincaid]] ([[Patrick Dempsey]]), who had previously been completely absent from the finale, after the production realized that his character simply disappeared from the plot and his story arc went nowhere.<ref name=\"scream3dvdcommentary\" />\n\nAs with production of ''Scream'', Craven encountered repeated conflicts over censorship with the [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system|MPAA]] regarding violence, and the director stated in an interview that the issues made him consider leaving the horror genre.<ref name=\"fangoria189\" />\n\n=== Music ===\n[[Marco Beltrami]] returned to score ''Scream 3'', having scored the previous two films in the series. For the film, Beltrami employed seven [[orchestrator]]s to aid in scoring the extensive orchestral accompaniment featured in the film's score.
