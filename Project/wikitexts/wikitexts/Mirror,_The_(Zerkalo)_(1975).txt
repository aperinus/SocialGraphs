It is loosely autobiographical, unconventionally structured, and incorporates poems composed and read by the director's father, [[Arseny Tarkovsky]]. The film features [[Margarita Terekhova]], Ignat Daniltsev, [[Alla Demidova]], [[Anatoly Solonitsyn]], Tarkovsky's wife [[Larisa Tarkovskaya]] and his mother Maria Vishnyakova. [[Innokenty Smoktunovsky]] provides voiceover and [[Eduard Artemyev]] the incidental music and sound effects.\n\n''Mirror'' is structured in the form of a [[nonlinear narrative]], with its main concept dating back to 1964 and undergoing multiple scripted versions by Tarkovsky and [[Aleksandr Misharin (screenwriter)|Aleksandr Misharin]]. It unfolds around memories recalled by a dying poet of key moments in his life and in Soviet culture. The film combines contemporary scenes with childhood memories, dreams, and [[newsreel|newsreel footage]]. Its cinematography slips between color, black-and-white, and [[Sepia tone|sepia]].

The adult Aleksei is only briefly glimpsed, but is present as a voice-over in some scenes including substantial dialogue. The film's structure is discontinuous and nonchronological, without a conventional plot, and combines incidents, dreams, memories, and newsreel footage.<ref>Timo Hoyer: Filmarbeit \u2013 Traumarbeit.

Vandenhoeck & Ruprecht, G\u00f6ttingen 2007, S. 85\u2013110. {{ISBN|978-3-525-45179-3}}.</ref> The film switches among three different time frames: prewar (1935), wartime (1940s), and postwar (1960s or '70s).\n\n''Mirror'' draws heavily on Tarkovsky's own childhood. Memories such as the evacuation from Moscow to the countryside during the war, a withdrawn father and his own mother, who worked as a [[Proofreading|proofreader]] at a printing press, feature prominently.\n\n===Synopsis===\nThe film opens with Aleksei's adolescent son Ignat switching on a television and watching the examination of a man with a stutter by a physician who finally manages to make her patient say without disruption: \"I can talk\". After the opening titles, a scene is set in the countryside during prewar times in which Aleksei's mother Maria, also called Masha and Marusya, speaks with a doctor who chances to be passing by. The exterior and interior of Aleksei's grandfather's country house are seen. The young Aleksei, his mother and sister watch as the family barn burns down. In a dream sequence, Maria is washing her hair.\n\nIn the postwar time frame, Aleksei is heard talking with his mother on the phone while rooms of an apartment are seen. Switching back to the prewar time frame, Maria is seen rushing frantically to her workplace as a proofreader at a printing press. She is worried about a mistake she may have overlooked, but is comforted by her colleague Liza ([[Alla Demidova]]), who then seemingly reduces her to tears with withering criticism. Back in the postwar period, Aleksei quarrels with his ex-wife, Natalia, who has divorced him and is living with their son Ignat. This is followed by newsreel scenes from the [[Spanish Civil War]] and of a balloon ascent in the U.S.S.R.\n\nIn the next scene, in Aleksei's apartment, Ignat meets with a strange woman sitting at a table. At her request, Ignat reads a passage from a letter by [[Alexander Pushkin|Pushkin]] and receives a telephone call from his father Aleksei. Ignat answers a knock at the door, which turns out to be a woman who says she has the wrong apartment. When Ignat returns to the woman at the table, she has vanished, though the condensation from her teacup momentarily remains. Switching to wartime, the adolescent Aleksei is seen undergoing rifle training with a dour instructor, intercut with newsreel footage of World War II and the [[Sino-Soviet border conflict]]. Before the war, Maria visits her neighbor with Aleksei to seek toiletries. The woman introduces Maria to her son and requests she slaughter a [[cockerel]], which she does.\n\nAleksei and his sister reunite with their father at the war's end. The film then returns to the quarrel between Aleksei and his wife in the postwar sequence. Switching again to prewar time, vistas of the country house and surrounding countryside are followed by a dreamlike sequence showing a levitating Maria. The film then moves to the postwar time, showing Aleksei apparently on his deathbed with a mysterious malady and holding a small bird. The final scene is in the prewar time frame, showing a pregnant Maria intercut with scenes showing Maria young and old. (Old Maria is played by Tarkovsky's mother, Maria Vishnyakova.)\n\n==Cast==\nSeveral of the characters are played by the same actors.\n* [[Filipp Yankovsky]] as the child Aleksei\n* Ignat Daniltsev as the adolescent Aleksei and Ignat, Aleksei's son\n* [[Innokenty Smoktunovsky]] as the adult Aleksei (voice only)\n* [[Margarita Terekhova]] as the young Maria/Masha/Marusya (Aleksei's mother) and Natalia (Aleksei's wife)\n* Maria Vishnyakova (Tarkovsky's real-life mother) as the elderly Maria\n* [[Oleg Yankovsky]] as Aleksei's father\n* [[Alla Demidova]] as Liza, Maria's friend at printing house\n* [[Anatoly Solonitsyn]] as forensic doctor and pedestrian\n*[[Nikolai Grinko]] as printing house director\n*[[Yuriy Nazarov (actor)|Yuriy Nazarov]] as military instructor\n* Tamara Ogorodnikova as nanny and strange woman at the tea table\n* [[Larisa Tarkovskaya]] as Nadezhda, Aleksei's neighbor\n* [[Arseny Tarkovsky]] as narrator/poet (voice only)\n* Olga Kizilova as the redhead\n\n==Production==\n===Writing===\nThe concept of ''Mirror'' dates to 1964, when Tarkovsky wrote down his idea for a film about the dreams and memories of a man, without the man appearing on screen. The first episodes of ''Mirror'' were written while Tarkovsky was working on ''[[Andrei Rublev (film)|Andrei Rublev]]''. These episodes were published in 1970 as a short story titled ''A White Day''. The title was taken from a 1942 poem by his father, [[Arseny Tarkovsky]]. In 1968, after finishing ''Andrei Rublev'', Tarkovsky went to the cinematographer's resort in [[Repino]] intending to write the script for ''The Mirror'' with Aleksandr Misharin. This script was titled ''Confession'' and was proposed to the film committee at [[Goskino]]. Although it contained popular themes such as a heroic mother, the war, and patriotism, the proposal was rejected. The main reason was most likely the complex and unconventional script. Moreover, Tarkovsky and Misharin clearly stated that they did not know what the film's final form would be; this was to be determined in the process of filming.<ref name=\"TarkovskyScreenplays\">{{cite book | last = Tarkovsky | first = Andrei | editor =William Powell | title = Collected Screenplays | publisher = Faber & Faber | year = 1999 | location = London }}</ref>\n\nWith the script rejected by the film committee, Tarkovsky went on to make the film ''[[Solaris (1972 film)|Solaris]]''. But his diary entries show that he was still eager to make the film. Finally, the new head of Goskino, Filipp Ermash, approved the script in the summer of 1973. Tarkovsky was given a budget of 622,000 [[Soviet rouble|Rbls]] and 7,500 metres (24,606 feet) of Kodak film, corresponding to 110 minutes, or roughly three takes, assuming a film length of 3,000 metres (10,000 feet).<ref>{{cite book | last = Tarkovsky | first = Andrei | translator = Kitty Hunter-Blair | title = Time Within Time: The Diaries 1970\u20131986 | publisher = [[Seagull Book]] | year = 1991 | location = Calcutta | page = 77 (July 11, 1973) | isbn = 978-81-7046-083-1}}</ref>\n\nSeveral versions of the script for ''Mirror'' exist, as Tarkovsky constantly rewrote parts of it, with the latest variant written in 1974 while he was in Italy. One scene that was in the script but removed during shooting was an interview with his mother. Tarkovsky wanted to use a hidden camera to interview her on the pretext that it was research for the film. This scene was one of the main reasons [[Vadim Yusov]], the cameraman for all of Tarkovsky's previous films, refused to work with him on this film.<ref>{{cite book | last = Tarkovsky | first = Andrei | translator = Kitty Hunter-Blair | title = Time Within Time: The Diaries 1970\u20131986 | publisher = [[Seagull Book]] | year = 1991 | location = Calcutta | pages = 60\u201361 (September 17, 1972) | isbn = 978-81-7046-083-1}}</ref> At various times, the script and the film were titled ''Confession'', ''Redemption'', ''Martyrology'', ''Why are you standing so far away?'', ''The Raging Stream'' and ''A White, White Day'' (sometimes also translated as ''A Bright, Bright Day'').
