The film follows a wealthy woman whose yachting vacation with friends in the Mediterranean Sea takes an unexpected turn when she and one of the boat's crew are separated from the others and they become stranded on a deserted island. The woman's [[capitalism|capitalist]] beliefs and the man's [[communism|communist]] convictions clash, but during their struggle to survive their situation, their social roles are reversed.<ref name=\"imdb\">{{cite web|title=Swept Away |publisher=[[IMDb]] |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0073817/ |access-date=8 March 2012}}</ref>\n\n''Swept Away'' was released to divisive, but largely positive reviews, and won the 1975 [[National Board of Review of Motion Pictures]] Award for Top Foreign Film.<ref name=\"imdbawards\">{{cite web|title=Awards for ''Swept Away'' |publisher=[[IMDb]] |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0073817/awards |access-date=9 March 2012}}</ref> An [[Swept Away (2002 film)|English-language remake]] starring [[Madonna]] and directed by her husband [[Guy Ritchie]], was released in 2002.\n\n==Plot==\n{| class=\"infobox\"\n|-\n!

Her nonstop political monologue infuriates one of the deckhands, Gennarino, a dedicated [[Communism|communist]] who manages to restrain his opinions to avoid losing his good job. Despite her humiliating insults, Gennarino agrees to take her out on a dinghy late in the evening to see the rest of her friends who have gone ahead without her. On their way, the [[outboard motor]] gives out, leaving them stranded in the middle of the sea with no land in sight.\n\nAfter a night at sea, Gennarino manages to get the motor running again, but has no idea where they are. Eventually they spot an island and head toward it, destroying their dinghy in the process. On land, they discover that there is no one else on the island. Accustomed to having everything done for her, Raffaella begins ordering Gennarino about, but he snaps, refusing to assist her any longer. Raffaella reacts with a string of insults, but he gives as good as he gets, and they split up to explore the island on their own.\n\nGennarino is soon catching and cooking lobsters. Gradually their roles become reversed. While she has to rely on him for food, Gennarino wants her to be his slave, convinced that women are born to serve men. He even forces her to endure the indignity of washing his underwear. When she reacts in angry defiance, he slaps her around. Gennarino starts to rape her, but then changes his mind, deciding that it would be more satisfying if she gave herself to him willingly.  Later that evening, Raffaella does approach him, and both willingly engage in passionate sex.  He wants her to fall in love with him, and she becomes subservient to him. Eventually they spot a ship, and although they are both reluctant to disrupt their newfound paradise, they signal the ship and are rescued.\n\nAfter returning home, they soon revert to their former lives and social roles\u2014she once again embracing the upper-class lifestyle of her friends; he returning to a life of a lower-class worker and husband. Abandoned by the object of his desires, Gennarino returns defeated to his sad life and loveless marriage\u2014far removed from an idyllic island in the Mediterranean Sea.\n\n==Production==\n{{Expand section|date=September 2017}}\nThe film was shot along the eastern [[Sardinia]]n coast, in the [[province of Nuoro]]; the sailing yacht that can be seen at the beginning of the movie is the [[J-class yacht]] [[Shamrock V]], at that time her name was Quadrifoglio.<ref>{{cite book|title=Yachting World, November 2001|language=it|access-date=2021-12-19|url=http://www.edoardonapodano.it/public/immagini/2013/01/quadrifoglio.pdf}}</ref> The beach of the landing of the two shipwrecked is Cala Fuili, in the municipality of Dorgali. The beach of Cala Luna, straddling the municipality of Dorgali and that of Baunei, has been set for another good part of the shooting. The Carunchio refuge and the most sensual scenes were filmed in the dunes of Capo Comino, a town in the municipality of [[Siniscola]].<ref name=\"imdblocations\">{{cite web|title=Filming locations for Swept Away |publisher=[[IMDb]] |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0073817/locations |access-date=9 March 2012}}</ref> The final scene of the helicopter's departure is set in the port of [[Arbatax]].\n\n==Reception==\n===Critical response===\nIn his review in the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'', American film critic [[Roger Ebert]] gave the film four stars, his highest rating. Ebert wrote that the film \"resists the director's most determined attempts to make it a fable about the [[bourgeoisie]] and the [[proletariat]], and persists in being about a man and a woman. On that level, it's a great success.\"<ref name=\"ebert\">{{cite web|last=Ebert |first=Roger |title=Swept Away by an Unusual Destiny in the Blue Sea of August |publisher=Ebert Digital LLC |work=RogerEbert.com |date=20 February 1976 |url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/swept-away-by-an-unusual-destiny-in-the-blue-sea-of-august-1976 |access-date=4 April 2018}}</ref>\n\nOther reviewers and analysts responded that those who focused on the misogyny simply didn't understand the film's message about [[Class conflict|class warfare]]. [[James Berardinelli]] defended the film, writing \"Those who view this film casually may easily mistake it for a male fantasy... The reality, however, is that Wertmuller is exhibiting the courage to show things that other filmmakers shy away from.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Berardinelli |first=James |title=Swept Away |publisher=Reel Views |year=2002 |url=http://preview.reelviews.net/movies/s/swept_away.html |access-date=11 March 2007}}</ref> John P.

Responding to the film's message about class warfare, she wrote \"So even if Wertmuller wanted to convey only a political message, she has clouded rather than clarified the issues. She should have made both parties male.\"<ref>{{cite journal |author=Tania Modleski |author-link=Tania Modleski |year=1976 |title=Wertmuller's Women Swept Away by the Usual Destiny |journal=Jump Cut: A Review of Contemporary Media |volume=1976 |issue=10\u201311 |pages=1, 16 |url=http://www.ejumpcut.org/archive/onlinessays/JC10-11older/SweptAwayModleski.html |access-date=11 March 2007 }}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nOn review aggregator website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film received a 57% positive rating from top film critics based on 21 reviews, with an average rating of 7.4/10.<ref name=\"rotten\">{{cite web|title=Swept Away (Travolti da un Insolito Destino nell'Azzurro Mare d'Agosto) (1975) |work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]  |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/swept_away/ |access-date=8 September 2022}}</ref>\n\n===Awards and nominations===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:250px;\" |Award\n! style=\"width:250px;\" |Category\n!style=\"width:50px;\"|Year\n!style=\"width:250px;\"|Nominee\n!style=\"width:50px;\"|Result\n|-\n|[[David di Donatello]]\n| Best Music\n|1975\n|[[Piero Piccioni]]\n| {{won}}\n|-\n|[[National Board of Review]] Award\n|Top Five Foreign Films<ref name=\"NBRMP\">{{Cite web|date=2019|title=1975 Award Winners|url=http://www.nationalboardofreview.org/award-years/1975/|access-date=16 May 2019|publisher=[[National Board of Review of Motion Pictures]]}}</ref>\n|1975\n| rowspan=\"2\" | ''Swept Away''\n| {{won}}\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" | [[New York Film Critics Circle]] Award\n| [[New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Film|Best Film]]\n| rowspan=\"3\" 1975 | 1975\n| {{nom}}\n|-\n|[[New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Director|Best Director]]\n| rowspan=\"3\" |[[Lina Wertm\u00fcller]]\n| {{nom}}\n|-\n|[[New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Screenplay|Best Screenplay]]\n| {{nom}}\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Tehran International Film Festival\n|Best Film\n| rowspan=\"2\" |1975\n|{{won}}\n|-\n|Best Actress\n|[[Mariangela Melato]]\n|{{won}}\n|}\n\n==Remake==\n{{main|Swept Away (2002 film)}}\nThe film was [[Remake|remade]] in 2002 as ''[[Swept Away (2002 film)|Swept Away]]'', starring [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] and directed by her then-husband [[Guy Ritchie]].
