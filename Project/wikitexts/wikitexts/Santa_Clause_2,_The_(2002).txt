It is a sequel to ''[[The Santa Clause]]'' (1994) and the second installment in [[The Santa Clause (franchise)|''The Santa Clause'' franchise]]. All of the principal actors from the first film, including [[Tim Allen]], [[Eric Lloyd]], [[Judge Reinhold]], [[Wendy Crewson]], and [[David Krumholtz]], reprise their roles, and are joined by [[Elizabeth Mitchell]] and [[Spencer Breslin]].\nReleased on November 1, 2002, the film received mixed reviews from critics and grossed $172 million worldwide on a $65 million budget. It was followed by another sequel, ''[[The Santa Clause 3: The Escape Clause]]'', released in 2006.\n\n== Plot ==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 to 700 words only. -->\nEight years following the events of ''[[The Santa Clause]]'', Scott Calvin has become a great [[Santa Claus]] at the North Pole, until Head Elf Bernard and Curtis, the Keeper of the ''Handbook of Christmas'', inform him that there is another clause \u2014 the \"[[Mrs. Claus]]e\". Scott is now pressed to get married before the next [[Christmas Eve]] or the clause will be broken and he will stop being Santa forever. At the same time, Abby the Elf delivers even more distressing news: Scott's teenage son Charlie is on the naughty list, due to having [[graffiti|vandalized]] his school to get attention. Scott must return to his home to search for a wife and set things right with Charlie. He brings this up when visited by the Council of Legendary Figures, consisting of [[Mother Nature]], [[Father Time]], [[Cupid]], the [[Easter Bunny]], the [[Tooth fairy|Tooth Fairy]], and the [[Sandman]]. To cover for Santa's prolonged absence, Curtis helps Scott create a life-sized animatronic Santa clone, much to Bernard's horror. However, at Santa's request, Bernard reluctantly plays along, and tells the other elves that Santa had a makeover, so they will not question the double's synthetic appearance.\n\nBecause of the impending end of his contract, Scott undergoes a \"de-Santafication process\" that gradually turns him back into Scott Calvin. He has a limited amount of magic to help him. Scott returns home to his former wife Laura, her husband Neil, their six-year-old daughter Lucy, and Charlie. He and Charlie face the ire of school principal Carol Newman when Charlie defaces the lockers.\n\nAt the North Pole, Toy Santa follows the rulebook too literally and begins to think that everyone in the world is naughty because of their small mistakes. As a result, Toy Santa takes over the North Pole using giant toy soldiers he made himself and unveils his plan to the elves to give lumps of coal to the world. Bernard exposes Toy Santa as a fraud, and Toy Santa places him under house arrest.\n\nAfter a few failed dates, Scott finds himself falling for Carol. He accompanies her in a horse-drawn sleigh to the faculty Christmas party, during which she confesses she used to believe in Santa as a child, until she was forced to stop doing so by her parents after fighting with children who told her Santa was not real. Using a little of his Christmas magic, Scott enlivens the otherwise dull party by presenting everyone with their childhood dream gifts. He makes a special presentation to Carol, and, with his last remnant of magic, wins her over and they kiss under mistletoe. However, when Scott attempts to explain to her that he is Santa, she believes that he is mocking her childhood, and throws him out. Later, Charlie confesses to Scott how hard it is for him that Scott is never around like other fathers, and reveals the pressure he is under to conceal the secret that his father is Santa. Lucy manages to convince Charlie not to be mad at him, which leads Charlie to convince Carol that Scott is Santa by showing her the magic snow globe he received during Scott's initial transformation.\n\nCurtis flies in to tell Scott about Toy Santa's plan. However, Scott has used up the last of his magic wooing Carol, and cannot return to the North Pole. With help from the Tooth Fairy, Scott and Curtis manage to get back, only for Toy Santa to find them and tie them up. Charlie and Carol spring them free by summoning the Tooth Fairy to fly them to the North Pole. Scott goes after Toy Santa, who has already left with the sleigh, riding Chet, a rambunctious reindeer-in-training, and they both crash back into the village. With an army of elves, Carol, Bernard, Charlie, and Curtis lead them into a snowball fight to overthrow the toy soldiers. Toy Santa is defeated and reduced to a six-inch height, Scott marries Carol in a ceremony, Scott transforms back into Santa and Carol transforms into Mrs. Claus, and Christmas proceeds as it always has. Scott and Charlie reveal the truth to Lucy about Scott being Santa Claus, promising to keep his secret.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Tim Allen]] as Scott Calvin / [[Santa Claus]] / Toy Santa\n* [[Elizabeth Mitchell]] as Principal Carol Newman\n* [[Wendy Crewson]] as Laura Miller\n* [[Judge Reinhold]] as Dr. Neil Miller\n* [[Liliana Mumy]] as Lucy Miller\n* [[David Krumholtz]] as Bernard The Head Elf\n* [[Eric Lloyd]] as Charlie Calvin\n* [[Spencer Breslin]] as Curtis The Elf\n* Danielle Woodman as Abby The Elf\n* [[Aisha Tyler]] as [[Mother Nature]]\n* [[Peter Boyle]] as [[Father Time]]\n* [[Jay Thomas]] as [[Easter Bunny]]\n* [[Kevin Pollak]] as [[Cupid]]\n* [[Art LaFleur]] as [[Tooth Fairy]] \n* [[Michael Dorn]] as [[Sandman]]\n* [[Molly Shannon]] as Tracy\n\n===Reindeer Voice Cast===\n* [[Bob Bergen]] as Comet\n* [[Kath Soucie]] as Chet\n\n== Production ==\nIn July 2000, it was announced Disney intended to move forward with a sequel to ''The Santa Clause'' with the initial draft written by [[Don Rhymer]] where the North Pole is operating at maximum efficiency until Santa is confronted with the challenge of balancing work and personal life.<ref name=\"SantaClauseSequel\">{{cite news|url=https://variety.com/2000/film/news/second-santa-set-for-disney-allen-1117784106/|title=  D Second 'Santa' set for Disney, Allen   |work=Variety|access-date=December 28, 2021}}</ref> Michael Lembeck became attached to direct in November of that year.<ref name=\"SantaClause2Director\">{{cite news|url=https://variety.com/2000/film/news/santa-clause-2-under-tv-helmer-s-tree-1117789791/|title=   'Santa Clause' 2 under TV helmer's tree    |work=Variety|access-date=December 28, 2021}}</ref>  In April 2001, Cinco Paul and Ken Daurio were brought on by Disney to pen another draft of the sequel.<ref name=\"SantaClause2Writers\">{{cite news|url=https://variety.com/2001/film/news/duo-board-santa-sleigh-1117797871/|title=   Duo board 'Santa' sleigh  |work=Variety|access-date=December 28, 2021}}</ref>\n\nThe film was shot in [[Vancouver, British Columbia]] and at Mammoth Studios in [[Burnaby, British Columbia]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://mammothstudios.ca/credits/|title = Credits &#124; Mammoth Studios}}</ref>\n\nA teaser trailer for this film originally referred to it as ''Santa Clause 2: The Escape Clause'', scheduled for release on November 21, 2001.
