The film was written and directed by [[Robert Towne]]. [[Tom Cruise]] (with [[Paula Wagner]] and [[Cruise/Wagner Productions]]) served as one of the film's producers. The film was released on a limited basis on March 17, 2006, and was entered into the [[28th Moscow International Film Festival]].<ref name=\"Moscow2006\">{{cite web|url=http://www.moscowfilmfestival.ru/miff34/eng/archives/?year=2006 |title=28th Moscow International Film Festival (2006) |accessdate=2013-04-21 |work=MIFF |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130421051006/http://www.moscowfilmfestival.ru/miff34/eng/archives/?year=2006 |archivedate=2013-04-21 }}</ref> It was filmed almost entirely in [[South Africa]] with the use of stages to portray [[Los Angeles]].\n\n==Plot==\nThe story is set during the [[The Great Depression|Great Depression]], specifically around the time of the [[1933 Long Beach earthquake]].\n\nCamilla ([[Salma Hayek]]) is a fiery, beautiful [[Mexico|Mexican]] caf\u00e9 waitress who aspires to make something of herself and give her and her future children a place and chance in the world. Arturo ([[Colin Farrell]]) is a struggling writer who comes to [[Bunker Hill, Los Angeles]] to start his writing career. Though he falls in love with Camilla, he does not marry her. Later, Camilla is infected by [[tuberculosis]] and leaves Arturo without informing him. When Arturo finds her, she is about to die and he promises to marry her, but Camilla dies and Arturo writes a novel dedicated to Camilla. Arturo writes a dedication in one of his books to her and throws it into the sand.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Colin Farrell]] as Arturo Bandini\n* [[Salma Hayek]] as Camilla Lopez\n* [[Donald Sutherland]] as Hellfrick\n* [[Eileen Atkins]] as Mrs. Hargraves\n* [[Idina Menzel]] as Vera Rivkin\n* [[Justin Kirk]] as Sammy\n* [[Dion Basco]] as Patricio/houseboy\n* [[Jeremy Crutchley]] as Solomon, the bartender\n* [[William Mapother]] as Bill\n* [[Tamara Craig Thomas]] as Sally\n}}\n\n==Production==\nThe rights to the novel once belonged to [[Mel Brooks]], though he let them lapse. Towne met Fante in the 1970s. This meeting led to his interest in the project. Despite finishing the script in the early 1990s, he couldn't find financial backing from a studio. During this time, Farrell's role was originally set to be played by [[Johnny Depp]] but he dropped out. Later [[Val Kilmer]] accepted the role and also dropped out. Another delay was Hayek initially rejecting the role to avoid being typecast as a Mexican immigrant. She accepted the role after eight years.\n\nPart of the film was shot at [[Pinelands High School]] ([[Cape Town]], [[South Africa]]), on fields modified to simulate a Los Angeles scenery. Scenes were also filmed at the very popular Sun City Resort in South Africa, specifically using the man-made beach at the Valley of Waves water park, for a romantic night-swim scene.\n\n==Critical reception==\nThe film received negative to mixed reviews from critics. The review aggregator [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reported that 35% of critics gave the film positive reviews, based on 104 reviews. The site's consensus states: \"Though Hayek is luminous, Farrell seems miscast, and the film fails to capture the gritty, lively edginess of the book upon which it's based.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/ask_the_dust/ |title=Ask the Dust Movie Reviews, Pictures - Rotten Tomatoes |accessdate=2008-03-29 |publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080329155859/http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/ask_the_dust/| archivedate= 29 March 2008 | url-status= live}}</ref> [[Metacritic]] reported the film had an average score of 58 out of 100, based on 33 reviews.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/film/titles/askthedust |title=Ask the Dust (2006): Reviews |accessdate=2008-03-29 |publisher=[[Metacritic]]| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080420075426/http://www.metacritic.com/film/titles/askthedust| archivedate= 20 April 2008 | url-status= live}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{IMDb title|0384814}}\n*{{Rotten-tomatoes|ask_the_dust}}\n*{{Metacritic film}}\n*{{mojo title|askthedust}}\n*{{Amg movie|306119}}\n\n{{Robert Towne}}\n{{Tom Cruise (actor)}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Ask The Dust (Film)}}\n[[Category:2006 films]]\n[[Category:2006 romantic drama films]]\n[[Category:American romantic drama films]]\n[[Category:German romantic drama films]]\n[[Category:Cruise/Wagner Productions films]]\n[[Category:2000s English-language films]]\n[[Category:English-language German films]]\n[[Category:Films about race and ethnicity]]\n[[Category:Films about writers]]\n[[Category:Films based on American novels]]\n[[Category:Films based on works by John Fante]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Robert Towne]]\n[[Category:Films set in 1933]]\n[[Category:Films set in the 1930s]]\n[[Category:Films set in Los Angeles]]\n[[Category:Films shot in South Africa]]\n[[Category:Films about interracial romance]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by Robert Towne]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Ramin Djawadi]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Heitor Pereira]]\n[[Category:Films produced by Tom Cruise]]\n[[Category:2000s American films]]\n[[Category:2000s German films]]"}]}}}}
