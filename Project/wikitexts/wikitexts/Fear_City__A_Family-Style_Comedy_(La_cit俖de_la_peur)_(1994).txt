She is invited to the [[Cannes film festival]], where she is faced with the unanimous opinion that the movie is extremely bad. However, ''Red is Dead'' soon attracts the public attention when its projectionist is murdered by what seems to be a [[copycat crimes|copycat]] of the movie's killer. Ecstatic, Odile brings the movie's [[intellectually disabled]] star Simon J\u00e9r\u00e9mi ([[Dominique Farrugia|Farrugia]]) to the festival and hires [[bodyguard]] and self-proclaimed [[Womanizing|womanizer]] Serge Karamazov ([[Alain Chabat|Chabat]]) to protect them. One by one, all the projectionists assigned to the movie are murdered, keeping ''Red is Dead'' in the spotlight. Meanwhile, detective Patrick Bial\u00e8s ([[G\u00e9rard Darmon|Darmon]]) investigates on the murders and starts a romantic relationship with Odile.\n\n==Detailed plot==\n===First day of the festival===\nThe film opens with the last minutes of ''Red is Dead''. In their bloody house, Sandy ([[H\u00e9l\u00e8ne de Fougerolles|de Fougerolles]]) and Ben (Farrugia) congratulate themselves on their defeat of Youri, the [[communist]] killer who murdered their entire family, and who is now lying on the floor, apparently dead.  Sandy goes to have a bath while Ben cleans the house in preparation for a dinner they have tonight. When Sandy comes out of the bathroom, she is attacked by a very alive Youri. Ben tries to protect her and accidentally kills her. He rushes out of the house and struggles to find the keys to open his [[Convertible|convertible car]]. When he finally succeeds, the killer is only a few feet away from him. Ben, however, remembers with horror that he has forgotten to turn the [[vacuum cleaner]] off, and runs back to the house, knocking Youri into a conveniently placed [[petroleum]] puddle with the car door. After turning the vacuum cleaner off, he runs back to the car, where a phone call warns him that Youri is standing behind him. Ben fights Youri with his car phone, and manages to send him back into the puddle before setting it on fire. \nAfter Ben drives into the sunset, Youri triumphantly emerges from the puddle and the [[end credits]] roll.\n\nIn the theater, Odile Deray asks the viewers what they thought. Everybody leaves without a word, and she chases after a [[movie critic|critic]] and pleads with him to write a favorable article. He refuses on the grounds that the movie is \"utter crap\". We learn that Odile is the publicist for the movie, and that today is the first day of the [[Cannes film festival]]. Odile visits the projectionist ([[Tch\u00e9ky Karyo|Karyo]]) and briefly talks with him while he argues on the phone with his wife. After Odile leaves, the projectionist is murdered by a hammer and sickle wielding killer.\n\n===Second day of the festival===\nOdile is talking with the projectionist's widow ([[Val\u00e9rie Lemercier|Lemercier]]). While the widow mourns her husband and reminisces their last argument, Odile realizes she can use the murder for publicity, and decides to bring the film's star to the festival, and to hire a bodyguard.\n\nIn a hotel room, a man watches the news on television. A deputy was murdered, and the main suspect is a politician called Jean-Paul Martoni. When the projectionist's murder is brought up, the man turns the TV off.\n\nIn [[Paris]], Serge Karamazov unsuccessfully tries to talk his boss's secretary into letting him sleep with her. She ignores him and tells him to go in to talk to his boss. While playing various sports, Karamazov's boss reminds him that his job description does not include having sex with his clients, and instructs him to go to [[Cannes]] to protect Simon J\u00e9r\u00e9mi, ''Red is Dead'''s main star. \nAt the [[Nice]] airport, Karamazov meets Odile, and the two see Simon arrive, wielding a balloon and a nametag, and accompanied by a stewardess. Once in the car, Odile tells Simon of all the exciting things he is going to do in Cannes, prompting Simon to throw up. He explains that he throws up whenever he is really happy.\nWhile Karamazov and Simon get to the Martinez hotel and are taken to their room, a second projectionist ([[Daniel G\u00e9lin|G\u00e9lin]]) is murdered in the same fashion as the first one.\n\nIn the projection room, Odile discovers the body and calls the police. Commissaire Bial\u00e8s soon arrives and is introduced by a short documentary movie about his life thus far. Simon and Karamazov arrive at the scene. Karamazov tells a police officer of his frustration at having to babysit Simon, and Simon, excited to see a [[Kinoton]] [[movie projector]], throws up. Bial\u00e8s wonders about the meaning of the letters found carved on the wall after both murders, an O and a D, and concludes that they spell \"[[Major scale|do]]\", leading him to believe that the killer is a musician.\n\nAt the police headquarters, Odile is being interrogated in a scene parodying ''[[Basic Instinct]]'' (instead of smoking, Odile is eating [[sauerkraut]]). As Commissaire Bial\u00e8s tells Odile of his suspicion that she planned the murders as a [[publicity stunt]], another policeman comes in with a new piece of information: he found a piece of fabric on the scene of the crime. \nBack in the unnamed man's hotel room, the man is once again watching the news, and as he passes in front of a mirror, his face is revealed.\n\n===Third day of the festival===\nAt the Martinez, Odile instructs Karamazov and Simon to hurry and get ready for the [[press conference]], which starts in an hour. Upon realizing that Simon doesn't have anything to wear, Odile and Karamazov take him shopping in an obvious ''[[Pretty Woman]]'' parody.\n\nLater, at the press conference, Odile scolds two women who are loudly gossiping, and the projection starts. \nMeanwhile, Karamazov is in the projection room to protect the projectionist ([[Jean-Pierre Bacri|Bacri]]) against the killer. Karamazov, however, has [[food poisoning]], and is passing foul gas, which prompts the projectionist to send him away to the bathroom. On his way, Karamazov meets an old flame, and they make awkward small talk. In the projection room, the projectionist is murdered. \nKaramazov sees the killer run away, and chases after him. However, he is stopped by a group of [[mime artist|mime]]s protesting against [[sound film]]s, and the killer gets away.\n\n===Fourth day of the festival===\nOdile is making preparations for the next projection, while Karamazov demonstrates his new hi-tech [[metal detector]] and Simon tries on outfits. Everybody gathers around the TV when a report about ''Red is Dead'' is shown on the news. It features an interview of Odile and Simon at a party held in the honour of the murdered projectionists, during which Simon, once again, throws up.\n\nLater, at the Martinez, Odile meets Bial\u00e8s for dinner. Odile talks about her life before ''Red is Dead'', and as [[sexual tension]] quickly builds up between the two, they leave for Bial\u00e8s's apartment. \nAt a night club, Simon finds Karamazov completely drunk and ranting about his inability to seduce Odile. \nMeanwhile, at Bial\u00e8s's apartment, the two have just had sex, and Odile accidentally discovers the killer's costume in a wardrobe. Horrified, she rushes to the night club, where she finds Karamazov enthusiastically insulting her.\n\nThe next scene starts with a disclaimer stating that, because of budgetary limits, it will be entirely [[Dubbing (filmmaking)|dubbed]] by the crew, including [[sound effect]]s. Amidst arguments and chit chat by the dubbers, the fourth projectionist ([[Eddy Mitchell|Mitchell]]) is killed, and the killer accidentally cuts his own finger. Another disclaimer then informs the viewer that the dubbed scene is over.\n\n===Fifth and last day of the festival===\nAt the hotel's restaurant, Odile is briefing Simon about his scheduled interviews. Karamazov arrives, and Odile tells him she has found the next projectionist, who will be joining them. They argue about Karamazov's behaviour in the night club, and Odile reveals that she thinks Bial\u00e8s is the murderer. Karamazov muses about the letters left by the killer: they are now O, D, I and L. Karamazov wonders if it spells [[Le Lido|Lido]], and theorizes that the killer may be a [[cabaret]] dancer. He then proceeds to explain that the murderer is probably a [[serial killer]], and that he has designed a giant [[mousetrap]] to catch him.\n\nHis explanations are interrupted by the arrival of the new projectionist, the unnamed man who was seen watching the news all throughout the movie: it's \u00c9mile Gravier ([[Sam Karmann|Karmann]]), an old friend of Odile's. The camera dramatically zooms on \u00c9mile's finger, which is wrapped in a bandage. \nOdile and \u00c9mile reminisce about their youth, the latter much more enthusiastically than the former.\n\nLater, the awards ceremony is about to start, and Odile, Karamazov, Simon and \u00c9mile are in a [[Limousine]], getting ready to climb the famous stairs to the Palais des festivals. Odile offers \u00c9mile chewing gum, which prompts him to remember, in a [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]], the way Odile always neglected him for her boyfriends, while he was secretly in love with her. \nThe four get out of the car and make their way up the stairs. Suddenly, Jean-Paul Martoni, who has been convicted of the deputy's murder, arrives and, threatening the crowd with a gun, runs into the building. \u00c9mile, under enormous stress, passes out.\n\nOnce inside, Odile panics about \u00c9mile's unconsciousness, which leaves her with no projectionist. Simon reveals that he can project ''Red is Dead'', having been trained as a projectionist, and adds \"because, you see, I'm not really an actor!\". \nWhile Simon prepares to start projecting the movie, the crowd is getting impatient. Odile instructs Karamazov to distract them, and he and Bial\u00e8s launch in an \"improvised\" musical number about the [[Carioca (dance)|Carioca]], which the public loves. \nThe movie starts playing, and they get off the stage. Bial\u00e8s is reminded of Martoni's presence inside the building, and goes after him.\n\nIn the projection room, Simon is attacked by \u00c9mile, who reveals that he killed all the previous projectionists in an attempt to get Odile's attention. After Simon offers \u00c9mile some chewing gum, the two struggle and knock the projector around.\nIn the theater, Odile is horrified to notice that the wrong reel has been launched, and instructs Karamazov to go check on Simon. Karamazov finds \u00c9mile and Simon in a struggle, and exclaims \"Simon, so it was you all along! I knew it!\", letting \u00c9mile escape. A frustrated Simon explains that \u00c9mile is the killer.\n\nSimon and Karamazov chase after \u00c9mile, only to discover him caught in Karamazov's giant mouse trap. Odile and Bial\u00e8s arrive and learn the killer's identity. Odile inquires about the costume she found in Bial\u00e8s's apartment, but his explanation is covered by loud music. The two reconcile, but suddenly, Martoni storms in and takes Odile [[hostage]]. After shooting Bial\u00e8s in the knee, Martoni is knocked out by \u00c9mile, who managed to get out of the trap. \u00c9mile starts to explain himself, but is shot by Martoni. As he lays dying, Odile offers him chewing gum.\n\nMartoni is arrested and Bial\u00e8s is carried away on a gurney; he reassures Odile that he will be able to walk again, but she tells him she is only worried about her movie. \nOutside, Karamazov once again wonders about the letters, O, D, I, L. \nOdile, Simon and Karamazov walk away. When Simon says that he is hungry and would be happy to eat Chinese, Karamazov and Odile agree to go to an Italian restaurant.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Alain Chabat]] as Serge Karamazov, Yuri, and a journalist\n*[[Dominique Farrugia]] as Simon J\u00e9r\u00e9mi (a.k.a.
