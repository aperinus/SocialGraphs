The film follows the crew of a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[T-55]] tank who became lost during the [[Soviet\u2013Afghan War|Soviet war in Afghanistan]]. The film has enjoyed a cult-favorite status in spite of its low box office statistics.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1981 [[Afghanistan]], a Soviet tank unit attacks a [[Pashtun people|Pashtun]] village harboring a group of [[mujahideen]] fighters. Following the assault, one of the tanks\u2014commanded by ruthless commander Daskal\u2014takes a wrong turn through a mountain pass and enters a [[blind valley]]. Taj returns to discover the village destroyed, and his father and brother killed\u2014the latter by having been crushed under Daskal's tank. As the new [[Khan (title)|khan]] following his brother's death, Taj is spurred to seek revenge and leads a band of [[mujahideen]] fighters into the valley to pursue Daskal's tank, which they call 'The Beast', counting on their captured [[RPG-7]] anti-tank weapon to destroy it.\n\nLost, isolated, and with their radio damaged in the village attack, the tank crew set out to find [[Kabul\u2013Kandahar Highway|Kandahar Road]] and return to Soviet lines. While camping for the night, [[Democratic Republic of Afghanistan|Afghan communist]] crewman Samad educates the reluctant tank driver, Konstantin Koverchenko, about the [[Pashtun people]]'s code of honour, ''[[Pashtunwali]]''; particularly ''[[nanawatai]]'', which requires that an enemy is to be given [[sanctuary]] if requested.\n\nEn route, the crew suffer several setbacks and ambushes from Taj's band. Suspecting Samad to be a traitor, Daskal murders him in front of his men; Koverchenko threatens to report Daskal. At a brief stop, Koverchenko states that the tank is breaking down; Daskal accuses him of mutiny and orders gunner Kaminski and loader Golikov to tie him to a rock, and leave him with a grenade behind his head as a [[booby-trap]] for the mujahideen. [[Wild dog]]s eventually attack Koverchenko, but he is saved when the grenade rolls off the rock and explodes, scaring them away. Taj's band reunite with several vengeful women from the village and find Koverchenko, who pleads for ''nanawatai.'' The mujahideen give him food and shelter. Koverchenko befriends Taj after fixing the broken RPG-7 and agrees to help them destroy the tank.\n\nMeanwhile, the remaining tank crew finally realize they are trapped in the valley, until a Soviet helicopter appears and offers to rescue them. Daskal refuses the offer, has the tank refueled, and the crew heads back towards the narrow mountain pass where they entered, which the helicopter pilot says is the only way out. The crew drives through the night and find the helicopter crew dead\u2014they drank from a waterhole unaware that the tank crew had poisoned earlier with [[cyanide]].\n\nThe mujahideen and Koverchenko catch up with the tank and pursue it through the pass. Koverchenko finally fires the RPG after a tense chase, only to damage the tank's main gun. Just as it seems the tank will escape, the village women use explosives to blow up the cliff-side, dropping boulders onto the tank and disabling it. Koverchenko sets fire to the tank's leaked fuel, forcing the crew to bail; he pleads ''nanawatai'' on their behalf, and Taj reluctantly agrees. Koverchenko confronts Daskal over his brutality, and declares he hopes that he lives to see the Soviets lose the war.\n\nKaminski and Golikov flee on foot, but Daskal is chased down by the village women and murdered; they bring back his bloodied uniform to Taj as a trophy. Horrified, Koverchenko waves down an arriving Soviet helicopter to be rescued. Koverchenko salutes Taj as he is hoisted by a harness, brandishing a [[jezail]] musket Taj had gifted to him. The film ends with Koverchenko flying off with the helicopter over the Afghan landscape.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[George Dzundza]] as Commander 'Tank Boy' Daskal\n* [[Jason Patric]] as Konstantin Koverchenko\n* [[Steven Bauer]] as Khan Taj \n* [[Erick Avari]] as Samad \n* [[Stephen Baldwin]] as Anatoli Golikov \n* [[Donald Patrick Harvey]] as Kaminski\n* David Sherrill as Kovolov\n* [[Kabir Bedi]] as Akbar\n* Chaim Jeraffi as Moustafa\n* Shoshi Marciano as Sherina\n* Yitzhak Ne'eman as Iskandar\n* Roberto Pollack as Shahzaman\n* Avi Gilor as Khahzaman\n* Beni Baruchin as Afzal\n* Victor Ken as Ali\n* Avi Keedar as Noor\n* Claude Aviram as Sadioue\n* Moshe Vapnik as Hasan\n* [[Dale Dye]] as Helicopter Crew Chief (uncredited)\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n===Filming===\nThe film was shot in [[Israel]].  Several actual [[T-55]] tanks were used in the film; however, the helicopter used in the film was not a real [[Mil Mi-8|Mi-8]], but an [[Aerospatiale SA.321 Super Frelon]]. The tank in question in the movie is actually an Israeli modification of a Soviet T-55 captured by the Israelis from their Arab armies, redesignated as the [[Tiran tank|Ti-67]] and fitted with a [[Royal Ordnance L7|105mm main gun]] in place of the original [[D-10 tank gun|100mm gun]], leading some{{who|date=January 2022}} to mistake it for a [[T-62]]. Many of these conversions were used by the Israelis during the 1973 [[Yom Kippur War]]. The film's military advisor, [[Dale Dye]], has written that he negotiated the purchase of the tanks over drinks with [[Israel Defense Forces]] officers in a [[Tel Aviv]] hotel.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.warriorsinc.com/FilmThoughts.cfm?ProjectID=7 |title=The Beast-Thoughts on the Production |publisher=Warriorsinc.com |access-date=2011-10-14}}</ref> The language spoken by the Afghan characters is [[Pashto language|Pashto]]. The Pashto dialogue is [[Subtitles#In films and television|subtitled]] but some television screenings have omitted the subtitles.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\n==Music==\n===Soundtrack===\nThe original soundtrack music was released by CBS/Columbia Records shortly after the movie's debut, written and performed entirely by [[Mark Isham]]. The back of the album suggests two tracks (\"Badal\" and \"Nanawatai\"), but there are, in fact, ten. Offered in 12-inch LP vinyl, CrO2 cassette and DDD-format compact discs. Used CD copies command rather high prices since limited numbers were released in spite of composer [[Mark Isham]]'s celebrity status.\n\nIn addition to the soundtrack, the song ''\u0422\u0440\u043e\u043b\u043b\u0435\u0439\u0431\u0443\u0441'' (\"[[Red Wave#Side 2 (Kino)|Trolleybus]]\") by the Russian rock band [[Kino (band)|Kino]] is heard playing on the radio during a scene. However, ''\u0422\u0440\u043e\u043b\u043b\u0435\u0439\u0431\u0443\u0441'' was not released until 1983, two years after the events portrayed in the movie. The song was titled ''Streetcar Headed East'' in English-speaking countries.\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of American films of 1988]]\n*[[List of Asian historical drama films]]\n*''[[Afghan Breakdown]]''\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{IMDb title|id=0094716|title=The Beast of War}}\n*{{Mojo title|beast|The Beast}}\n*{{rotten-tomatoes|the_beast_1988|The Beast}}\n*[http://www.warriorsinc.com/FilmDetail.cfm?ProjectID=7 Notes on the production from military advisor Dale Dye] broken link\n\n{{Kevin Reynolds}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Beast, The}}\n[[Category:1988 films]]\n[[Category:1980s war films]]\n[[Category:American war adventure films]]\n[[Category:American war drama films]]\n[[Category:War epic films]]\n[[Category:1980s English-language films]]\n[[Category:Pashto-language films]]\n[[Category:Cold War films]]\n[[Category:American films based on plays]]\n[[Category:Films about armoured warfare]]\n[[Category:Soviet\u2013Afghan War films]]\n[[Category:Fiction about tanks]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Kevin Reynolds]]\n[[Category:Films set in Afghanistan]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Afghanistan]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Israel]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Mark Isham]]\n[[Category:American anti-communist propaganda films]]\n[[Category:1980s American films]]"}]}}}}
