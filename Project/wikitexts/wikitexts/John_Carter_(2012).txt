The film was produced by [[Jim Morris (film producer)|Jim Morris]], [[Colin Wilson (film producer)|Colin Wilson]], and Lindsey Collins. It stars [[Taylor Kitsch]] in the title role, [[Lynn Collins]], [[Samantha Morton]], [[Mark Strong]], [[Ciar\u00e1n Hinds]], [[Dominic West]], [[James Purefoy]] and [[Willem Dafoe]]. The film chronicles the first interplanetary adventure of [[John Carter of Mars|John Carter]] and his attempts to mediate [[civil war|civil unrest]] amongst the warring kingdoms of [[Barsoom]].\n\nSeveral attempts to adapt the ''Barsoom'' series had been made since the 1930s by various major studios and producers. Most of these efforts, however, ultimately stalled in [[development hell]]. In the late-2000s, [[Walt Disney Pictures]] began a concentrated effort to adapt Burroughs' works to film, after an abandoned venture by the studio in the 1980s. The project was driven by Stanton, who had pressed Disney to renew the [[Film rights|screen rights]] from the Burroughs estate. Stanton became the new film's director in 2009. It was his live-action debut, as his previous directorial work for Disney was on the [[Pixar]] animated films ''[[Finding Nemo]]'' (2003) and ''[[WALL-E]]'' (2008).<ref name=\"Den of Geek\">{{cite news|url=https://www.denofgeek.com/movies/946918/what_we_know_about_john_carter.html|title=What We Know About John Carter|last=Lambie|first=Ryan|date=June 19, 2011|newspaper=Den of Geek|access-date=June 22, 2011}}</ref><ref name=\"SlashFilmSciretta\">{{cite news|url=https://www.slashfilm.com/john-carter-of-mars-to-be-pixars-first-live-action-film-bryan-cranston-joins-cast/|title=John Carter of Mars to be Pixar's First Live Action Film, Bryan Cranston Joins Cast|last=Sciretta|first=Peter|date=January 13, 2011|newspaper=SlashFilm|access-date=June 22, 2011}}</ref> Filming began in November 2009, with [[principal photography]] underway in January 2010, wrapping seven months later in July.<ref name=\"Latino Review\">{{cite news|last=Blaber|first=Genevieve|title=Utah is Beginning to Look Like Mars|url=http://www.latinoreview.com/news/utah-is-beginning-to-look-like-mars-7124|access-date=June 22, 2011|newspaper=Latino Review|date=June 12, 2009}}</ref><ref name=\"standard.net\">{{cite news |title=Disney wraps up Mars movie shooting in Utah |newspaper=[[Standard-Examiner]] |date=August 2, 2010 |url=http://www.standard.net/node/47453 |access-date=November 4, 2010}}</ref> [[Michael Giacchino]], who scored many Pixar films, composed the film's music.<ref name=\"Los Angeles Times Hero Complex\">{{cite news|url=http://herocomplex.latimes.com/2011/06/16/john-carter-andrew-stanton-on-martian-history-comic-con-and-monty-python/|title='John Carter': Andrew Stanton on Martian history, Comic-Con and ...

Other critics have argued the film was doomed from the start since those works had so thoroughly appropriated the source material as to assure that modern audiences would see ''John Carter'' as unoriginal.\n\n==Plot==\n<!--Per [[WP:FILMPLOT]], movie plots are 400 to 700 words ONLY. Please respect this longstanding guideline. -->\n\nIn 1881, [[Edgar Rice Burroughs]] attends the funeral of his uncle, John Carter, a former [[American Civil War]] [[Confederate States Army|Confederate Army]] [[Captain (armed forces)|captain]] who died suddenly. Per Carter's instructions, the body is put in a tomb that can be unlocked only from the inside. His attorney gives Carter's personal journal for Burroughs to read.\n\nIn a flashback to 1868 in the [[Arizona Territory]], [[Union Army|Union]] Colonel Powell arrests Carter with hopes that Carter will help in fighting local [[Apache]]. Carter escapes his holding cell, but fails to get far with U.S. cavalry soldiers in close pursuit. After a run-in with a band of Apaches, Carter and a wounded Powell are chased until they hide in a cave that turns out to be filled with gold. A Thern appears in the cave at that moment and, surprised by the two men, attacks them with a knife; Carter kills him but accidentally activates the Thern's powerful medallion and is unwittingly transported to a ruined and dying planet, Barsoom, known to Carter as Mars. Because of his different bone density and the planet's low gravity, Carter is able to jump high and perform feats of incredible strength. He is captured by the Green Martian Tharks and their Jeddak, Tars Tarkas.\n\nElsewhere on Barsoom, the Red Martian cities of Helium and Zodanga have been at war for a thousand years. Sab Than, Jeddak of Zodanga, armed with a special weapon obtained from the Thern leader Matai Shang, proposes a cease-fire and an end to the war by marrying the Princess of Helium, Dejah Thoris. The Princess escapes and is rescued by Carter.\n\nCarter, Dejah, and Tarkas's daughter, Sola, reach a spot in a sacred river to find a way for Carter to get back to Earth. They discover that the medallions are powered by a \"ninth ray\" that is also the source of Sab Than's weapon. They are then attacked by a vicious race called the Warhoon under the direction of Shang. Carter and Dejah are taken back to Zodanga. A demoralized Dejah grudgingly agrees to marry Sab Than and gives Carter instructions on how to use the medallion to return to Earth. Carter decides to stay and is captured by Shang, who explains to him the purpose of Therns and how they manipulate the civilizations of different worlds to their doom, feeding off the planet's resources in the process, and intend to do the same thing with Barsoom by choosing Sab Than to rule the planet. Carter goes back to the Tharks with Sola to request their help. There they discover Tarkas has been overthrown by a ruthless brute, Tal Hajus. Carter and an injured Tarkas battle with two enormous Great White-Apes in an arena before Carter kills Hajus, thereby becoming the leader of the Tharks.\n\nThe Thark army charges on Helium and defeats the Zodangan army, while Sab Than is killed and Shang is forced to escape. Carter becomes prince of Helium by marrying Dejah. On their first night, Carter decides to stay forever on Mars and throws away his medallion. Seizing this opportunity, Shang briefly reappears and gives Carter another challenge, sending him back to Earth. Carter embarks on a long quest to find one of their medallions on Earth; after several years he appears to die suddenly and asks for unusual funeral arrangements \u2014 consistent with his having found a medallion, since his return to Mars would leave his Earth body in a coma-like state, and makes Burroughs his protector.\n\nBack in the present, Burroughs runs back to Carter's tomb and uses clues to open it. Just as he does so, a Thern appears and raises a weapon before Carter appears and shoots the Thern in the back. He reveals that he had never found another medallion; instead, he devised a scheme to lure a Thern from hiding, thus winning Shang's challenge. Carter then uses the dead Thern's medallion to return to Barsoom.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Taylor Kitsch]] as [[John Carter of Mars|John Carter]], a Confederate army captain who is transported to Mars.\n* [[Lynn Collins]] as [[Dejah Thoris]], the Princess of Helium.\n* [[Samantha Morton]] as Sola, a Thark that works with John Carter.\n* [[Mark Strong]] as Matai Shang, the Hekkador of the Therns. \n* [[Ciar\u00e1n Hinds]] as Tardos Mors, the Jeddak of Helium and Dejah Thoris' father.\n* [[Dominic West]] as Sab Than, the Jeddak of Zodanga.\n* [[James Purefoy]] as Kantos Kan, the [[Captain|Odwar]] of the ship Xavarian.\n* [[Bryan Cranston]] as Colonel Powell, a Union colonel who wants John to help his U.S. cavalry soldiers against the Apache.\n* [[Daryl Sabara]] as [[Edgar Rice Burroughs|Ned]], John Carter's nephew.\n* [[Polly Walker]] as Sarkoja, a merciless Thark who hates Sola.\n* [[Thomas Haden Church]] as Tal Hajus, a vicious Thark who dislikes John Carter and Tars Tarkas.\n* [[Willem Dafoe]] as [[Tars Tarkas]], the Jeddak of the Tharks and Sola's father.\n* [[David Schwimmer]] as a young Thark Warrior, a Thark who informs Tars Tarkas that 18 of the Thark eggs did not hatch.\n* [[Jon Favreau]] as the Thark bookmaker, a Thark who collects the bets on any conflict.\n* [[Don Stark]] as Dix, a shopkeeper at an Arizona town where John Carter stops.\n* [[Nicholas Woodeson]] as Dalton, John Carter's executor who summons Edgar.\n* [[Art Malik]] as Zodangan General.\n\n==Development==\n===Origins===\n[[File:Princess of Mars large.jpg|right|upright|thumb|Cover of the first edition of ''[[A Princess of Mars]]'' by [[Edgar Rice Burroughs|Burroughs]], [[A.

The story was originally serialized in six monthly installments (from February through to July 1912) in the [[pulp magazine]] ''[[The All-Story]]''; those chapters, originally titled \"[[Under the Moons of Mars]]\", were then collected as a novel and published in hardcover five years later from [[A. C. McClurg]].{{citation needed|date=April 2022}}\n\n===Bob Clampett involvement===\nIn 1931, ''[[Looney Tunes]]'' director [[Bob Clampett]] approached Edgar Rice Burroughs with the idea of adapting ''A Princess of Mars'' into a feature-length animated film. Burroughs responded enthusiastically, recognizing that a regular live-action feature would face various limitations to adapt accurately, so he advised Clampett to write an original animated adventure for John Carter.<ref>{{cite news|first=Jim |last=Korkis |title=Lost Cartoons: The Animated \"John Carter of Mars\" |publisher=Jim Hill Media |date=June 2, 2003 |url=http://jimhillmedia.com/blogs/jim_korkis/archive/2003/06/02/1093.aspx |access-date=January 2, 2009}}</ref> Working with Burroughs' son John Coleman Burroughs in 1935, Clampett used [[rotoscope]] and other hand-drawn techniques to capture the action, tracing the motions of an athlete who performed John Carter's powerful movements in the reduced Martian gravity, and designed the green-skinned, 4-armed Tharks to give them a believable appearance. He then produced footage of them riding their eight-legged Thoats at a gallop, which had all of their eight legs moving in coordinated motion; he also produced footage of a fleet of rocketships emerging from a Martian volcano. [[MGM]] was to release the cartoons, and the studio heads were enthusiastic about the series.<ref name=\"glut105-6\">{{cite book|last=Glut |first=Donald F. |title=The Frankenstein archive: Essays on the Monster, the Myth, the Movies, and More |pages=105\u20136 |publisher=McFarland |date=2002 |isbn=0-7864-1353-0}}</ref>\n\nThe test footage, produced by 1936,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.erbzine.com/mag21/2175.html|title=The John Carter Animation Project: Promotional Portfolio by John Coleman Burroughs |publisher= ERBzine (#2175) |date= 2008 |access-date=December 9, 2009}}</ref> received negative reactions from film exhibitors across the U.S., especially in small towns; many gave their opinion that the concept of an Earthman on Mars was just too outlandish an idea for midwestern American audiences to accept. The series was not given the go-ahead, and Clampett was instead encouraged to produce an animated [[Tarzan]] series, an offer that he later declined. Clampett recognized the irony in MGM's decision, as the ''[[Flash Gordon (serial)|Flash Gordon]]'' [[movie serial]], released in the same year by [[Universal Studios]], was highly successful. He speculated that MGM believed that serials were played only to children during Saturday matinees, whereas the John Carter tales were intended to be seen by adults during the evening. The footage that Clampett produced was believed lost for many years, until Burroughs' grandson, Danton Burroughs, in the early 1970s found some of the film tests in the Edgar Rice Burroughs Inc. archives.<ref name=\"glut105-6\" /> Had ''A Princess of Mars'' been released, it might have preceded [[Walt Disney]]'s ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]'' to become the first American feature-length animated film.<ref name=\"hughes\">{{cite book|last=Hughes |first=David |title=The Greatest Science Fiction Movies Never Made |publisher=[[Titan Books]] |date=2008 |pages=311\u201322 |isbn=978-1-84576-755-6}}</ref>\n\n===Disney progression===\nDuring the late 1950s, [[stop-motion animation]] effects director [[Ray Harryhausen]] expressed interest in filming the novels, but it was not until the 1980s that producers [[Mario Kassar]] and [[Andrew G. Vajna]] bought the rights for [[Walt Disney Studios (division)|Walt Disney Studios]] via [[Cinergi Pictures]], with a view to creating a competitor to ''[[Star Wars]]'' and ''[[Conan the Barbarian (1982 film)|Conan the Barbarian]]''. [[Ted Elliott (screenwriter)|Ted Elliott]] and [[Terry Rossio]] were hired to write, while [[John McTiernan]] and [[Tom Cruise]] were approached to direct and star. The project collapsed because McTiernan realized that visual effects were not yet advanced enough to recreate Burroughs' vision of Barsoom. The project remained at Disney, and [[Jeffrey Katzenberg]] was a strong proponent of filming the novels, but the rights eventually returned to the Burroughs estate.<ref name=\"hughes\" />\n\n===Paramount effort===\nProducer [[James Jacks]] read [[Harry Knowles]]' autobiography, which lavishly praised the ''John Carter of Mars'' series. Having read the Burroughs' novels as a child, Jacks was moved to convince [[Paramount Pictures]] to acquire the film rights; a [[bidding war]] with [[Columbia Pictures]] followed. After Paramount and Jacks won the rights, Jacks contacted Knowles to become an adviser on the project and hired [[Mark Protosevich]] to write the screenplay. [[Robert Rodriguez]] signed on in 2004 to direct the film after his friend Knowles showed him the script. Recognizing that Knowles had been an adviser to many other filmmakers, Rodriguez asked him to be credited as a producer.<ref name=\"hughes\" />\n\nFilming was set to begin in 2005, with Rodriguez planning to use the all-digital stages he was using for his production of ''[[Sin City (film)|Sin City]]'', a film based on the [[graphic novel]] series by [[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller]].<ref name=\"hughes\" /> Rodriguez planned to hire [[Frank Frazetta]], the popular Burroughs and fantasy illustrator, as a designer on the film.<ref>{{cite news|first=Drew |last=McWeeny |title=Holy Crap!!

In 2004, unable to employ a non-DGA filmmaker, Paramount assigned [[Kerry Conran]] to direct and [[Ehren Kruger]] to rewrite the John Carter script. The Australian [[Outback]] was scouted as a shooting location. Conran left the film for unknown reasons and was replaced in October 2005 by [[Jon Favreau]].<ref name=\"hughes\" />\n\nFavreau and screenwriter [[Mark Fergus]] wanted to make their script faithful to Burroughs' novels, retaining John Carter's links to the [[American Civil War]] and ensuring that the Barsoomian [[Tharks]] were {{cvt|15|ft}} tall (previous scripts had made them human-sized). Favreau argued that a modern-day soldier would not know how to fence or ride a horse like Carter, who had been a Confederate officer. The first film he envisioned would have adapted the first three novels in the Barsoom series: ''[[A Princess of Mars]]'', ''[[The Gods of Mars]]'', and ''[[The Warlord of Mars]]''. Unlike Rodriguez and Conran, Favreau preferred using [[practical effects]] for his film and cited ''[[Planet of the Apes (1968 film)|Planet of the Apes]]'' as his inspiration. He intended to use make-up, as well as [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]], to create the Tharks. In August 2006, Paramount chose not to renew the film rights, preferring instead to focus on its ''[[Star Trek (film)|Star Trek]]'' [[Media franchise|franchise]]. Favreau and Fergus moved on to [[Marvel Studios]]' ''[[Iron Man (2008 film)|Iron Man]]''.<ref name=\"hughes\" />\n\n===Return to Disney, Stanton involvement===\n[[File:Andrew Stanton 2012 crop.jpg|thumb|right|Andrew Stanton in 2012]]\n[[Andrew Stanton]], director of the [[Pixar|Pixar Animation Studios]] hits ''[[Finding Nemo]]'' (2003) and ''[[WALL-E]]'' (2008), lobbied the [[Walt Disney Studios (division)|Walt Disney Studios]] to reacquire the rights from Burroughs' estate. \"Since I'd read the books as a kid, I wanted to see somebody put it on the screen,\" he explained.<ref name=\"LA Times March 6 story\">{{cite news|author=Dawn C.

The studio was initially skeptical. Stanton had never directed a live-action film before, and wanted to make the film without any major stars whose names could guarantee an audience, at least on opening weekend.

Aware that Carter's backstory as an officer in the Confederate Army might be a problem for modern audiences, Stanton envisioned the character as disillusioned and disgusted with war in general, apart from the side he fought on. \"I wanted to not absolve him of that, but also not make him pro the side he was on. The best I could do was neutralize him.\" [[Taylor Kitsch]] quickly became his choice for the part, due to a scene in the ''[[Friday Night Lights (TV series)|Friday Night Lights]]'' television series where his character, angry, is left behind by the bus that captured Stanton's vision for the character, as Kitsch's pose echoes that of Carter on one cover of the books in Stanton's collection.<ref name=\"The Wrap story\" />\n\n[[Lynn Collins]], a [[Juilliard School|Juilliard]] graduate set in her first major movie role as [[Dejah Thoris]] early on, tested with many actors, including [[Josh Duhamel]], using a scene (filmed but cut) where she slaps Carter in the face. \"Taylor and I have always had incredible chemistry. It was inevitable that we would get a chance to really explore it and work as a team,\" she said of her co-star in ''[[X-Men Origins: Wolverine]]''. She recalls him coming into the dressing room after their test together and, seeing her smoking, told her she would have to quit if she got the part, which she did. At Disney's insistence, she used a British accent.<ref name=\"The Wrap story\" />\n\nTom Cruise expressed interest in playing the role once production had begun; Collins did not read with him. \"I think him and Andrew had some conversations, but I don't think he was ever actually in the mix so to speak\", she recalled in 2022, noting that all the actors she read with were 20 years younger than him. Stanton said that as there was at that time the possibility of making two sequels, he kept that in mind. \"[I]t would take a while to make these three movies.\" he recalled. \"I'm like, ''How do I feel about how these people might age in the next five to seven years?''\"<ref name=\"The Wrap story\" />\n\n[[Willem Dafoe]] and [[Samantha Morton]] played their roles as [[Tharks]] wearing [[motion capture]] suits while walking on [[stilt]]s.

He worked with more restraint than he had been used to. Normally he kept the camera rolling even after the director said \"[[Cut (transition)#Verbal command|Cut]]!\", a lesson he learned from [[Jackie Chan]] while making ''[[Shanghai Noon]]''. However, for ''John Carter'', Stanton had planned the shots in such great detail before filming began as to leave little room for improvisation.<ref name=\"The Wrap story\" />\n\nStanton went for a different look for the movie's costuming than that which had been planned by [[Robert Rodriguez]] when he was attached to the project several years earlier. Rodriguez had planned to turn the design of costumes and sets over to illustrator [[Frank Frazetta]], whose art for the books is considered iconic, but was unable to take the film due to his resignation from the [[Directors Guild of America]]. Stanton felt that Frazetta's look was \"very sexist and it's very male, fanboy dominated\". While conceding the sex appeal at the heart of the characters, he believed they still had to seem realistic. \"I want anything, whether it\u2019s a fish or a robot or a toy or a human being, I want them to be seen as dimensional as possible and be seen as somebody with thoughts and opinions and surprise in how they may react to something, and contradictions.\"<ref name=\"The Wrap story\" />\n\nThroughout production there had been arguments from some of Stanton's friends in Pixar's Braintrust that it would be better for the movie to begin with Carter finding himself on Mars than through the narrative device of having Burroughs, supposedly his nephew, find his late uncle's written account of his time there following his death and then [[Flashback (narrative)|flashing back]] to it. Stanton in response considered that \"lazy\". He told them \"If I do that, then thirty minutes in I'm going to have to stop the film to explain the war, and Dejah, and who everyone is, and we\u2019re going to have even bigger problems.\" They compromised by beginning the movie with the battle on Mars, and then the Zondangans getting the nanofoam gun from the Therns. That shift necessitated 18 new scenes, for which Disney agreed to a reshoot.<ref name=\"Friend20110417\" />\n\n====Cinematography and visual effects====\nThe film was shot in the [[Panavision]] [[anamorphic format]] on [[Eastman Kodak|Kodak]] [[35mm movie film|35mm film stock]]. \"I try very hard to persuade whomever I'm working with to allow me to shoot on film, and to shoot anamorphically,\" Mindel told ''ICG'', the magazine of the [[International Cinematographers Guild]]. \"It's the most pure, high-definition way of capturing a scene, short of Showscan or IMAX.\"<ref name=\"ICG\">{{cite web|last=Heuring |first=David |title=War Lords |url=http://www.icgmagazine.com/wordpress/2012/03/01/war-lords/ |work=[[International Cinematographers Guild|ICG Magazine]] |date=March 1, 2012 |access-date=April 4, 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120406220538/http://www.icgmagazine.com/wordpress/2012/03/01/war-lords/ |archive-date=April 6, 2012 }}</ref>\n\nBut Mindel also liked the flaws in that process. Older Panavision lenses have imperfections and aberrations, and \"At a purely organic level, the light does unmanageable things when it hits an aberration\", he said. \"An unquantifiable magic happens, and I love that!\" That unpredictability, and the effect on the film's texture and [[Film grain|grain]], gave Mindel images he hoped would \"[feel] inherently realistic in spite of the fantastical creatures and the extensive digital-visual-effects technology behind them\". For ''John Carter'' he used Panavision's Primo and C-series anamorphic lenses and ATZ and AWZ [[zoom lens]]es, with [[List of motion picture film stocks#Vision3 color negative (ECN-2 process 2007\u2013present)|Kodak's Vision3 500T Color Negative 5219 and 200T 5213 stock]].<ref name=\"ICG\" />\n\nShooting with a 3D release in mind was considered but dropped over a year before [[principal photography]]. The camera crew and effects specialists viewed Disney's ''[[Alice in Wonderland (2010 film)|Alice in Wonderland]]'', where space on the set was planned with the 3D release in mind. They realized that the processes used for that film would be outdated before they could expect that they would start ''John Carter'', so there was no point in planning for 3D; Stanton also believed that would be too much to deal with while shooting in any event. Mindel said that was \"a huge relief\".<ref name=\"ICG\" />\n\nWork on the visual effects had begun even earlier, in 2009, before the release of ''[[Avatar (2009 film)|Avatar]]'', which revolutionized the field. The effects team doing proof-of-process tests realized when that movie came out that ''John Carter'' would require extensive use of all the techniques that ''Avatar'' had pioneered, and would go where that film had not with many more interactions between human actors and CGI characters. Peter Chiang, the film's visual effects supervisor at [[DNEG|Double Negative]] in London, wrote a production bible for the latter that described how each character should be composed and framed. Bruce McCleery, the [[second unit]]'s director of photography, said that bible was especially useful for scenes blending humans and CGI characters. \"Working that out was much more complex than it sounds.\"<ref name=\"ICG\" />\n\nShooting the airship battle on a London soundstage required extensive preproduction work. Mindel and the lighting  crew started work designing the lighting rig for that scene long before shooting started. They shared their work with the effects teams, which used [[Lidar]] to map it, as it did for every set. The sets housed the full {{convert|110|ft|m|adj=on}} airship models, mounted on [[gimbal]]s with [[green screen]] on all sides. Ultimately, to stage an aerial battle with light-based weapons where the ships maneuver to block the sunlight that powers their opponents' craft, the lighting crew used 120 [[Balloon light|Spacelights]], 15 Dino light banks, flashing lights and a crane mounted with soft lights and green screens that could fill in [[Available light|ambient light]] from the film's sky.<ref name=\"ICG\" />\n\nOnce production moved to the Utah desert, the weather added its own challenges. Heavy winds brought frequent [[sandstorm]]s, forcing many on location to work while wearing goggles and sometimes [[burnous|burnooses]]. Mindel wanted the film to take advantage of these conditions as much as possible, although he had to tone it down slightly so the effects teams could do their job. \"All the uncontrollable natural phenomena did give the film a visceral, unpredictable quality, and contributed to its unique, idiosyncratic texture,\" McCleery said.<ref name=\"ICG\" />\n\n====Reshoots====\n\nBefore the formal reshoot, which took place throughout September in the Los Angeles neighborhood of [[Playa Vista, Los Angeles|Playa Vista]],<ref name=\"ICG\" /> Stanton told ''[[The New Yorker (magazine)|The New Yorker]]'' he had done some smaller-scale reshooting focusing on additional dialogue for some characters in order to address the issues the preview had raised. In London, he shot scenes where West, as Sab Than, clarified the Therns' goals. Back in Los Angeles, Kitsch and Collins filmed Carter's proposal scene. Then Stanton went back to London to film Strong's side of the conversation with Sab Than.<ref name=\"Friend20110417\" /> Stanton denied assertions that he had gone over budget and stated that he had been allowed a longer reshoot because he had stayed on budget and on time.<ref name=thr120217>{{cite news | url = https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/andrew-stanton-john-carter-lie-over-budget-disney-reshoots-292488 | title = Andrew Stanton Slams 'John Carter' Budget Overage Claims: \"A Complete and Utter Lie\" | first = Todd | last = Gilchrist | work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] | date = February 17, 2012 | access-date =March 12, 2012 }}</ref>\n\nStanton reshot much of the movie twice, far more than was common in live action filmmaking at that time. He attributed that to his animation background.<ref name=\"NYT March 12 article\" /> \"The thing I had to explain to Disney was, 'You're asking a guy who's only known how to do it this way to suddenly do it with one reshoot.'\" he explained later. \"I said, 'I'm not gonna get it right the first time, I'll tell you that right now.'\"<ref name=\"LA Times March 6 story\" /> Stanton often sought advice from people he had worked with at Pixar on animated films (known as the Braintrust) instead of those with live-action experience working with him.<ref name=Friend20110417 />\n\nStanton also was quoted as saying, \"Is it just me, or do we actually know how to do this better than live-action crews do?\"<ref name=\"Friend20110417\" /> [[Rich Ross]], Disney's chairman, successor to [[Dick Cook]], who had originally approved the film for production,{{efn|By some accounts, Cook had [[Green-light#Film industry|greenlit]] ''John Carter'' before he or anyone in the studio's production division had read the script.<ref name=\"THR pre-release marketing article\" />}} came from a television background and had no experience with feature films. The studio's new top marketing and production executives had little more.<ref name=\"NYT March 12 article\" />\n\n''[[The New Yorker|New Yorker]]'' writer [[Tad Friend]] visited the set during the reshoot and wrote an article about it, noting that it was \"unusually extensive (and expensive)\". Collins and Kitsch both made comments on the record about the reshoot that seemed defensive; Stanton told Friend not only that if it had been up to him he would have insisted on a second reshoot but that reshoots should be \"mandatory\".<ref name=Friend20110417 /> It has subsequently been suggested that this article began the media narrative that ''John Carter'' was in serious trouble,<ref name=\"The Wrap story\" /> as conventional Hollywood wisdom held that ''any'' reshoot was an indicator of a troubled production.<ref name=\"LAT Sept 2012 article\">{{cite news|last=Keegan|first=Rebecca|title=Director Andrew Stanton looks back on 'John Carter's' rocky path|url=https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-xpm-2012-sep-08-la-et-mn-john-carter-director-20120908-story.html|url-access=registration|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=September 8, 2012|access-date=April 14, 2022}}</ref>\n\nCollins believes that the reshoot was detrimental for her character. Originally filmed as a strong, independent warrior, the scenes added, such as those with her father, made her seem more vulnerable; and scenes like those in which she had slapped Carter were cut. She believes the studio wanted a softer take on Thoris and was reduced to asking Stanton every day what would work with that and just doing it.<ref name=\"The Wrap story\" />\n\nAfter the reshoot, considerable work remained in post-production on Stanton's first cut, reportedly almost three hours long.<ref name=\"Atlantic story\">{{cite magazine|last=Meslow|first=Scott|title=Why Did It Take 100 Years for John Carter to Make It to the Big Screen?|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2012/03/why-did-it-take-100-years-for-john-carter-to-make-it-to-the-big-screen/254220/|magazine=[[The Atlantic]]|date=March 8, 2012|access-date=April 22, 2022}}</ref> There were many effects and CGI shots to finish. Stanton recalls that \"[t]here were more animated shots in what was left to do on ''Carter'' than an entire animated feature\". Animating the Tharks, especially in large numbers during battle scenes, proved particularly challenging; the software had to be upgraded for it, and as one animator recalls, work scenes sometimes took three hours to open. Many of those working on the CGI were particularly appreciative of Stanton, since due to his background he had considerable expertise in the area and made himself more available than directors of such films usually are.<ref name=\"The Wrap story\" />\n\n==Marketing==\n\nThe filmmakers believe that the decisions made in marketing the film were the primary reason for its failure. A new studio executive team with minimal experience in that side of the business were in charge, and not as emotionally invested in its success as they had been. Furthermore, unbeknownst to them, Disney CEO [[Robert Iger]] had already begun talks with [[George Lucas]] about buying [[Lucasfilm]] and the ''[[Star Wars]]'' franchise, eliminating any incentive the company had to launch a successful competing film franchise.<ref name=\"The Wrap story\" /> ''John Carter''{{'}}s marketing campaign has been called one of the worst in movie history.<ref name=\"El Pa\u00eds story\" /><ref name=\"Vulture trailers story\" /><ref name=\"Washington Post story\" />\n\nThe head of Walt Disney Studios Marketing during the production was [[MT Carney|M T Carney]]<!-- This is how she styles her name; do not change -->, an industry outsider who previously ran a boutique marketing firm in New York<ref name=Goldstein20120420 /> with no previous experience marketing movies.<ref name=\"The Wrap story\" /> Stanton often rejected marketing ideas from the studio, according to those who worked on the film.<ref name=Vulture20120312>{{cite web|last=Brodesser-Akner|first=Claude|title=The Inside Story of How John Carter Was Doomed by Its First Trailer|url=https://www.vulture.com/2012/03/john-carter-doomed-by-first-trailer.html|work=Vulture|publisher=New York Media LLC|access-date=April 22, 2012}}</ref> His ideas were used instead, and he ignored criticism that using a cover version of [[Led Zeppelin]]'s 1975 song \"[[Kashmir (song)|Kashmir]]\" in the [[Trailer (promotion)|trailer]] released in conjunction with an ad aired during [[Super Bowl XLVI|that year's Super Bowl]] would make it seem less current to the contemporary younger audiences the film sought.<ref name=\"NYT March 12 article\" />\n\nHe also chose [[billboard]] imagery that failed to resonate with prospective audiences, and put together a preview reel that did not get a strong reception from a [[Science fiction convention|convention]] audience.<ref name=\"NYT March 12 article\" /> Stanton said, \"My joy when I saw the first trailer for ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'' is I saw a little bit of almost everything in the movie, and I had no idea how it connected, and I had to go see the movie.

Like ''John Carter'', it was based on a popular fantasy [[media franchise|franchise]] that had during the 1980s been adapted into successful films starring [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]]. Lionsgate's version had cost $90 million and starred [[Jason Momoa]].

It, too, had science fiction and western elements, and while not a failure commercially was seen as a disappointment, barely recouping its high budget. That was taken as indicating that contemporary audiences were not interested in [[Western (genre)#Film|westerns]], or any film set in the American past, so those elements would be downplayed in the trailers and other marketing for ''John Carter''.<ref name=\"Daily Beast story\">{{cite news|last=Lee|first=Chris|title='John Carter': Disney's Quarter-Billion-Dollar Movie Fiasco|url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/john-carter-disneys-quarter-billion-dollar-movie-fiasco|newspaper=[[The Daily Beast]]|date=February 21, 2012|access-date=April 20, 2022}}</ref>\n\nOne of Disney's own recent big-budget franchise films was also adding to executives' anxieties about ''John Carter''. The May 2011 release of ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides]]'' had done well at the box office, becoming the third highest-grossing film domestically that year and making over a billion dollars worldwide. However, the film's budget, exceeding $400 million by some estimates, made it [[List of most expensive films|the most expensive film ever produced]].<ref>{{cite web |first=Christian |last=Sylt |title=Fourth Pirates Of The Caribbean Is Most Expensive Movie Ever With Costs Of $410 Million |date=July 22, 2014 |work=[[Forbes]] |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/csylt/2014/07/22/fourth-pirates-of-the-caribbean-is-most-expensive-movie-ever-with-costs-of-410-million/ |access-date=April 10, 2022}}</ref> Its profits were thus lower than a film that popular might have been expected to generate, making Disney fear the same could happen with ''John Carter''. By the time of the reshoot four months after ''On Stranger Tides'', it was reported that ''John Carter'' would have to make at least $700 million worldwide, more than twice its escalating production costs, to justify a sequel.<ref name=\"Friend20110417\" />\n\n===July 2011 preview screening===\n\nInitially expectations of the film's commercial success were high. The studio held a [[sneak preview]] in mid-2011, before the reshoot, in [[Portland, Oregon]]. Stanton, who had been diagnosed with high-functioning [[attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]] early in the process of writing the script, was so nervous he took [[lorazepam]] not just on the flight there but before the preview, and four Disney executives were in attendance to watch the reactions of 400 filmgoers and read their opinions afterwards. The audience reactions seemed to indicate that audiences were engaged with the film and laughed when they were supposed to, which relaxed Stanton.<ref name=\"Friend20110417\" />\n\nAfterwards, many of them rated the film as \"very good\" or \"excellent\", for an average audience approval rating of 75 percent, which pleased the studio. Carney said that that number could probably be rounded up to 80, reflecting  work that had yet to be done. According to the preview cards, that work would also include improving the pacing of the film's second act, making the motivations of the Therns clearer, and developing the relationship between Carter and Thoris so that their wedding at the end was not so much of a surprise.<ref name=\"Friend20110417\" />\n\n===Title changes===\n\nThe film's title was a major issue; there are several accounts of who decided to change it and why. It is largely based on the first book of the series, ''[[A Princess of Mars]]'', but was originally titled ''John Carter of Mars''.{{efn|At the end of 2009 the independent film company [[The Asylum]] released ''[[Princess of Mars]]'', a low-budget film released [[Direct-to-video|direct-to-DVD]] in the United States, the only other filmed adaptation of the Barsoom novels. Its marketing, intended to capitalize on ''Avatar''{{'}}s success that year, acknowledges that the story inspired that movie without mentioning Burroughs. Its story, like the pre-2005 versions of the script, had Carter (played by [[Antonio Sab\u00e0to Jr.]], (with [[Traci Lords]] as Dejah) as a modern-day U.S. soldier initially fighting in Afghanistan, and, notwithstanding its title, dispensed with the notion of Barsoom as Mars entirely, making it a planet light-years away. Since the novel is in the [[public domain in the United States|public domain]] and thus any filmmaker could adapt it, Stanton has referred to it as an inevitable \"crappy knock-off\". It was rereleased in 2012 as ''John Carter of Mars''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.moviefone.com/2012/03/07/andrew-stanton-john-carter_n_1327070.html |title=&#124; Moviefone |publisher=News.moviefone.com |access-date=January 31, 2016 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121025001614/http://news.moviefone.com/2012/03/07/andrew-stanton-john-carter_n_1327070.html |archive-date=October 25, 2012 }}</ref>}} Stanton changed the title to that from the book's title early in 2011, \"because not a single boy would go.\" Later he removed \"of Mars\" to make it more appealing to a broader audience, calling the film an \"origin story ... about a guy ''becoming'' John Carter of Mars.\"<ref name=\"Bleeding Cool\" /> Disney also reportedly believed that the sex appeal of the popular Kitsch being shirtless throughout the movie would draw women to see the film.

There were no large merchandise displays in the company's [[Disney Store|online and retail stores]], nor at [[big-box store]]s like [[Target Corporation|Target]].{{efn|Ross had done these things in 2010 before the release of ''[[Tron: Legacy]]'', a similar big-budget franchise film that was expected to succeed, in the hope of being able to claim some credit for the film's success. While it did perform well at the box office, the merchandising did not do as well since Ross did not have the proper marketing expertise at the studio, leaving Disney with unsold videogames and T-shirts.<ref name=\"Daily Beast story\" />}} Nor were there prominently placed ads in the company's theme parks, or coverage on Disney-owned media such as the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] broadcast network or [[The Disney Channel]].<ref name=\"The Wrap story\" /> \"It needs to feel like an event, and right now it doesn't feel like an event,\" an unnamed marketing expert told ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]''.<ref name=\"THR pre-release marketing article\" />\n\nInstead, the company tried some alternative marketing approaches. Stanton gave a [[TED talk]] on storytelling, that had a short scene from ''John Carter'' as an example of one of his points.<ref>{{cite AV media |people=[[Andrew Stanton]]|date=February 2012|title=Andrew Stanton: The clues to a great story|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxDwieKpawg|access-date=April 19, 2022|location=[[Long Beach, California]], USA |publisher=[[TED (conference)|TED]]}}</ref> While that was seen as effective, some other promotions, such as an \"Are You The Real John Carter?\" contest, in which men who could prove that was their real name were encouraged to enter a contest where winners would be invited to a special fan screening, were not.<ref name=\"The Wrap story\" />\n\nAs the premiere date neared, some of the filmmakers were unaware of the negative press coverage already attached to the movie. Mindel and Stanton admitted later that they were somewhat oblivious due to largely being in contact only with those whom they had been working with in post-production. Collins said those who worked for her and followed media coverage kept that information from her.<ref name=\"The Wrap story\" />\n\nDafoe, on the other hand, was aware that the media were lowering the public and the industry's expectations for the film: \"[M]y recollection was that even before it was released, there were grumblings about it ... everything from the name change to regime change to poor publicity. But I remember before the movie was even seen, people were counting it out.\"<ref name=\"The Wrap story\" />\n\n====Poor tracking====\n\nTracking data, the results of long-term surveys of likely filmgoers to judge their interest in seeing an upcoming film upon its release, with a prediction of its opening weekend box office, for ''John Carter'' was returned to Disney in mid-February and shared both within and without the company. [[Nikki Finke]] reported in ''[[Deadline Hollywood]]'' that the numbers pointed to a serious failure. Barely half the likely audience was aware of the film, 27 percent said they were interested in seeing it, and only 3 percent said it would be their first choice that weekend.<ref name=\"Deadline tracking story\" />\n\nAn executive at a rival studio told Finke that demographic data with the \"shocking\" tracking for such a costly film showed that women in particular \"have flat out rejected the film\" and expected \"the biggest writeoff of all time.\" Finke reported that she had heard estimates of a loss around $100 million, but allowed that soft numbers had been widely expected as Disney's in-house surveys had been showing them for some time. Disney told her that the Super Bowl ad had given the film an expected \"pop of awareness\" and the studio remained committed to a full marketing push before the release.<ref name=\"Deadline tracking story\" />\n\nChabon says that on the eve of the premiere, he was in a hotel down the street and Disney's marketing department was showing the team the latest tracking. \"None of it was good\", he recalled. Despite doubts and awareness of previous occasions when such dire forecasts had been wide of the mark, \"[w]e just all kind of knew at that point it was going to be bad. It was not going to go well.\"<ref name=\"The Wrap story\" />\n\nJust before the film was released, an [[Evercore]] analyst who followed Disney more than doubled his estimate of the likely loss, to $165 million, because of the tracking. Other analysts had similarly revised their estimates upward, to $100 million or more.<ref name=\"THR anticipated writedown story\">{{cite news|last1=Szalai|first1=George|last2=Bond|first2=Paul|title='John Carter' Debacle: Analysts Predict $150 Mil Write-Down for Disney|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/general-news/john-carter-box-office-disney-flop-298610/|newspaper=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=March 12, 2012|access-date=April 21, 2022}}</ref>\n\n===Premiere===\n\nDisney scheduled the late February premiere for [[Regal Cinemas|Regal]]'s LA Live Theatre in [[downtown Los Angeles]], rather than the [[El Capitan Theatre]] in [[Hollywood, California|Hollywood]], which it owned and had renovated extensively. The choice of venue has been described as \"odd\", since Disney had held most of its premieres, particularly of big-budget franchise films, there since the renovation. In a [[news release]] announcing the premiere, Disney highlighted that the movie would be shown in [[3D film|3D]] on a {{convert|70|ft|m|adj=on}} screen to an audience of 800 in three theaters, ranging from the cast and crew and company executives to critics, [[D23 (Disney)|D23]] members and winners of contests.<ref name=\"The Wrap story\" />\n\nCollins, still unaware of the negative media perception of the film, recalls walking in and going down the [[red carpet]] behind Kitsch. She saw [[Rich Ross|Ross]] call him over and whisper something in his ear, after which he suddenly stepped back. When she caught up to Kitsch, she asked what Ross had told him that had so affected him. \" 'It's a disaster.' He just told me, 'It's going to be a fucking disaster.'\"<ref name=\"The Wrap story\" />\n\n===Post-release criticisms===\n\nIn the ''LA Times'' the week after the release, industry insiders suggested two reasons the film might have struggled to succeed with audiences regardless of how well it had been made or marketed. One was that more recent franchises, such as ''Star Wars'', that had derived and borrowed from Burroughs' original concepts in the century since it had been written had exhausted the potential for audiences to be enthralled by any modern adaptation of his work. [[James Jacks|Jacks]], the producer who had tried to make a film of the work in the early 2000s, recalled having given director [[Robert Zemeckis]] the novels in order to interest him in the project. \"I don't think so,\" Zemeckis told him after reading them. \"[[George Lucas|George [Lucas]]] has really plundered these books.\"<ref name=\"LAT post-release column\" />\n\nAnother industry marketing person, speaking anonymously, told the ''Times'' that modern audiences have a \"[[cognitive dissonance]]\" problem with films set on Mars based on older works. At the time Burroughs wrote, little was known about conditions on Mars, allowing an author to fill in those gaps with invented details. However, modern audiences know from the many actual [[List of missions to Mars|unmanned missions to Mars]] that that planet is [[Mars in fiction#Human survival|uninhabitable and apparently devoid of life]]. \"You're not able to sell [Burroughs's vision]\", he said.<ref name=\"LAT post-release column\" />\n\nTwo of the film's supporting cast members weighed in later in the year on the role marketing played in its poor box office performance in separate interviews with ''[[The A.V. Club]]''. In July, [[Bryan Cranston|Cranston]] called its cool reception \"unwarranted\" and blamed it on TV stations around the country focusing on commercial news about how ''John Carter'' had underperformed and not even won its opening weekend rather than offering a review of the film, leading viewers to make their decisions about what movie to see on that basis. \"Why is it all of a sudden important for average Americans to know how much money a movie made at the box office?\"<ref>{{cite interview |last=Cranston|first=Bryan|subject-link=Bryan Cranston|interviewer=Will Harris|title=Bryan Cranston on ''Breaking Bad''{{'}}s craziest season and what's next|work=[[The A.V.

West disclosed also that after production, in 2010, he had seen a marketing plan for the film that was never used, which he believed would have been much more effective than what Disney chose to do.<ref>{{cite interview|last=West|first=Dominic|subject-link=Dominic West|interviewer=Will Harris|title=Dominic West on ''The Hour'', ''John Carter'', and yes, ''The Wire''|work=[[The A.V.

She noted that all but one of the 10 [[List of most expensive films|most expensive films ever made]] had been made in the last decade, and all but one of those nine had been Disney productions. \"This is now the status quo for blockbuster cinema, an era of [[Too big to fail|too-big-to-fail]] filmmaking that is almost exclusively reliant on international grosses just to break even.\" Of those eight Disney films, ''John Carter'' was the only one not part of an existing franchise. That large budget was necessary to faithfully and credibly replicate Burroughs's vision onscreen, but at the same time audiences were accustomed enough to expensive CGI and effects spectacles that that alone could not be expected to impress them.<ref name=\"Screen Rant piece\">{{cite news|last=Donaldson|first=Kayleigh|title=John Carter: Everything That Went Wrong With Disney's Movie|url=https://screenrant.com/john-carter-movie-problems-bad-flop-reasons-explained/|work=[[Screen Rant]]|date=June 15, 2020|access-date=April 14, 2022}}</ref>\n\nDonaldson also criticized the titling, noting that the early decision to not use the book title, ''A Princess of Mars'', \"raised a lot of questions over who Disney wanted to sell the movie to\", implying that the studio feared that men might not be interested in a movie with \"Princess\" in the title, despite Disney's own experience to the contrary with its many [[Disney princess|princess]] movies. Stripping it down to just ''John Carter'' \"robbed the movie of its identity ... as a title [it] conveyed nothing to potential audiences about the movie they were being sold.\"<ref name=\"Screen Rant piece\" />\n\nStanton's stated reason for the latter move, that the narrative is about how John Carter becomes John Carter of Mars, also, to Donaldson, points to another problem that has beset other films adapted from series with multiple books. \"In an effort to play catch-up to a franchise that spent years developing its intricately woven multiple narratives, many studios tried to do the work of three or four movies in one\", she wrote. \"This resulted in a lot of franchise non-starters because audiences had little interest in films that existed solely to set up a bunch of sequels for a property they didn't care about.\" Among these she included ''[[Artemis Fowl (film)|Artemis Fowl]]'', ''[[Robin Hood (2010 film)|Robin Hood]]'', and ''[[King Arthur: Legend of the Sword]]''. Likewise with ''John Carter'', the realization of Barsoom onscreen \"wasn't enough to sustain a movie and didn\u2019t entice enough people to invest in a trilogy that would never see the light of day.\"<ref name=\"Screen Rant piece\" />\n\nDonaldson argued that in addition to being overtaken by works influenced by it, the Carter franchise was no longer popular enough to sustain an expensive film franchise by 2012, a century after the first book was published, an issue unintentionally highlighted by the use of \"Kashmir\" in the trailer. There still were fans, she conceded, but \"[n]ame recognition alone does not make a movie hit. Just ask [[The Legend of Tarzan (film)|the most recent ''Tarzan'' reboot]] for evidence of that, or Disney's own attempt to make ''[[Lone Ranger|The Lone Ranger]]'' a 21st century action favorite\", referring to [[The Lone Ranger (2013 film)|the studio's 2013 effort]], which also failed at the box office.\"<ref name=\"Screen Rant piece\" />\n\n==Music and soundtrack==\n{{main|John Carter (soundtrack)}}\nIn February 2010, [[Michael Giacchino]] revealed in an interview he would be scoring the film.<ref name=\"JoBlo\">{{cite news|url=https://www.joblo.com/movie-news/michael-giacchino-scoring-john-carter-of-mars|title=Michael Giacchino Scoring John Carter of Mars|last=Tassi|first=Paul|date=March 11, 2010|newspaper=JoBlo|access-date=June 23, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://kusc.podbean.com/2010/02/25/2010-oscar-best-score-nominee-michael-giacchino-up/ |title=2010 Oscar, Best Score Nominee \u2013 Michael Giacchino (Up) &#124; KUSC Podcasts |publisher=Kusc.podbean.com |access-date=October 7, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100311172122/http://kusc.podbean.com/2010/02/25/2010-oscar-best-score-nominee-michael-giacchino-up |archive-date=March 11, 2010 }}</ref> A year and a half later, in his ''New Yorker'' article, Friend documents accompanying Stanton on a visit to Giacchino where they discuss the movie's score and how it relates to the narrative. Stanton had put in the [[Temp track|scratch music]], the temporary music used to show what mood he wanted the actual score to reflect, himself rather than delegating that task to an editor as is commonly done.

When she appeared diegetically, she would be shown telling it to an infant, Carthoris, her child by Carter. Tardos would then have come into the scene, telling Dejah to go to bed herself and he would put his grandchild to bed. When she left, Tardos would have been revealed to actually be Matai Shang, having shapeshifted to appear to be Tardos, and then after Shang kidnapping the child the opening credits would have begun.<ref name=\"The Wrap story\" />\n\nFollowing the credits, Stanton said, Carter would be seen in his funeral suit lying in the middle of the desert, and waking up. He would take off his jacket and start walking, as a thoat driven by a Thark slowly came in from the horizon. The driver would tell Carter he knew who he was and someone was looking for him. He would take Carter to Kantos Kan, who had been searching for Carter for a long time and was shocked to actually find him. Kan would explain to Carter \"you have to get back to heal him\".<ref name=\"The Wrap story\" />\n\nThe audience, expecting a reunion, would then learn that some time had elapsed since the prologue. In the interim, Dejah would have disappeared as well, exploring the River Iss in hopes of finding Carter. Eventually it would have been revealed that the Therns took their child, which would have, as in the second of Burroughs' books and ''[[Beneath the Planet of the Apes]]'', led to revelations that a technologically advanced race living beneath the surface was controlling the air and water supply to keep the planet alive. He implied he had written more, but that was much as he was willing to reveal at that time.\n\n==Legacy==\n\nThe film's two leads remain proud of the work they did and believe the film is better than its reputation. Kitsch, who has largely returned to television work following his two big-budget failures in 2012, told ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' when ''[[21 Bridges]]'' was released in 2019 that \"I learned a ton on that movie. I honestly don't see it as a failure.\" He noted that fans in Europe still stopped him on the street and mentioned the movie, which he believed had also seen an uptick in viewership due to its recent availability on [[Netflix]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Davids|first=Brian|title=Taylor Kitsch on '21 Bridges' and Taking Pride in 'John Carter'|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/21-bridges-star-taylor-kitsch-is-still-proud-flop-john-carter-1257967/|newspaper=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=November 26, 2019|access-date=April 19, 2022}}</ref>\n\nCollins says it took some time for her to come to terms with the film and its effect on her career. Eventually, \"[p]eople started reaching out to me and expressing to me how much the movie changed their life, how much the character inspired them and motivated them ... It's posterity forever. I will die, and people will still be seeing this movie.\" She came to realize that \"a movie that is that polarizing is good no matter what, because that's what art is supposed to do.\"<ref name=\"The Wrap story\" />\n\nOn the 10th anniversary of the film's release, ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]''{{'}}s Richard Newby considered its longterm impact, observing that it \"changed the film landscape, just not in the way anyone intended it to ... [It] was the moment Disney became the servant of sure bets, and Hollywood realized star power was truly gone.

''John Carter'' is a flawed movie, but it's also endlessly charming. It has a winsome, earnest spirit and the action sequences bristle with ingenuity and life. It's goofy, but it's also incredibly fun ... The design and the cinematography are genuinely stunning and Stanton takes big swings, like a scene of Carter massacring a race of evil Tharnks that is intercut with him burying his wife and child back on Earth. The movie really goes for it in a way that few blockbusters do. Stanton left it all on the field.}}\n\nThree months later, ''[[/Film]]''{{'}}s Sandy Schaefer, after admitting that the film was \"not without its faults\", found ''John Carter'' was visually accomplished, \"combin[ing] the gravelly textures of a Western with the striking aesthetic of a pulp sci-fi epic.\" Stanton had made better use of the film's budget than other directors of more recent tentpole films. Ironically, Schaefer concluded, \"[a]fter a decade of superhero movies and ''Star Wars'' films, ''John Carter''\u2014itself adapted from source material that directly inspired so many of those things\u2014comes across as more refreshing and less derivative now than when it was first released.\"<ref name=\"/Film anniversary story\">{{cite news|last=Schaefer|first=Sandy|title=The Daily Stream: ''John Carter'' is a Vestige of Spunkier Disney Tentpoles|url=https://www.slashfilm.com/901436/the-daily-stream-john-carter-is-a-vestige-of-spunkier-disney-tentpoles/|newspaper=[[/Film]]|date=June 20, 2022|access-date=July 16, 2022}}</ref>\n\nConversely, the passage of time had not helped the film for ''[[Gizmodo]]''{{'}}s Germain Lussier, who wrote, \"I remember not hating the movie, but not particularly liking it either, and in the decade since release I've always wondered if ''John Carter'' had cult potential\". Upon watching it again, he concluded it did not. \"Ten years hasn't changed ''John Carter'' at all. It's still not an awful movie. There are a few really excellent things in there. But it's mostly just drawn out, uninteresting, and boring, in large part [due] to the whole thing feeling so derivative\", since by 2012 aspects of the story that had been original to Burroughs's work had been reused in so many other works.<ref name=\"Gizmodo anniversary piece\">{{cite news|last=Lussier|first=Germain|title=We Truly Wish ''John Carter'' Was Good, But It's Not|url=https://gizmodo.com/we-truly-wish-john-carter-was-good-but-its-not-1848622634|newspaper=[[Gizmodo]]|date=March 9, 2022|access-date=April 18, 2022}}</ref>\n\nLussier also felt the \"oceans of exposition between warring factions that are barely distinguishable\" came at the expense of the movie's more successful action sequences, and apart from Dafoe and Morton he felt most of the Thark characters had little depth. \"''John Carter'' works, but it doesn't work well,\" Lussier concluded. \"[T]his viewing made me realize that I doubt even 50 years will change how it feels.\"<ref name=\"Gizmodo anniversary piece\" />\n\n==See also==\n* [[2012 in film]]\n* [[List of films set on Mars]]\n* [[Sword and planet]], subgenre of adventure science fiction in which most combat is with swords\n\n== Explanatory notes ==\n{{Notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{Cite thesis |author=Firdi Mahda Tamalia |title=The Portrayal of White Superiority Within the ''John Carter'' Film |url=https://repository.unair.ac.id/83671/ |url-access=subscription |publisher=[[Airlangga University]] |location=[[Surabaya]], Indonesia |date=June 25, 2019|type=skripsi }}\n* {{Cite thesis |last=Iskandar |first=Arina |title=Earth and Mars Culture in Andrew Stanton's Movie ''John Carter of Mars'' (A Sociological Approach) |url=http://repositori.uin-alauddin.ac.id/6284/1/ARINA%20ISKANDAR_opt.pdf |type=Sarjana Humaniora (Bachelor of Arts equivalent) |publisher=[[Alauddin Islamic State University]] |location=[[Makassar]], Indonesia |date=2016}}\n* Miller, Thomas Kent.
