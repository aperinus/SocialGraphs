Rafael sees his father Nino ([[H\u00e9ctor Alterio]]) frequently but his friends rarely. He's fielding offers to sell the restaurant he runs in [[Buenos Aires]], but changes his mind because it was started by his mother and father and has been in the family for years. His childhood friend Juan Carlos ([[Eduardo Blanco (actor)|Eduardo Blanco]]), who he has not seen for twenty years, drops by the restaurant and renews their old friendship, demonstrating the fact that he has become an actor.\n\nOne day, Rafael suffers a [[heart attack]] and, as he recovers in the [[intensive care unit]], he is forced to reevaluate his life and determine his priorities.  He now wants to sell the restaurant and move to southern Mexico and raise horses. At the same time his father wants to remarry his wife because they were never married in the Catholic Church and she always wanted a church wedding.  Rafael is opposed to the renewal of vows because his ailing mother will not be able to be much of a participant, due to her Alzheimer's. As part of his new life, he tells his much-younger girlfriend Nati that he wants some space and some freedom.  At first she is hurt and tells him that he is no [[Albert Einstein]], [[Bill Gates]], or even Dick Watson (Rafael is puzzled about the identity of Dick Watson, and it becomes a running joke.  The end credits make clear that it refers to a character in a [[Pornographic film|porno]] film). Although Rafael tries to get her to understand his perspective, she breaks off their relationship. Rafael tries to deal with his struggles with this relationships and the fact that the Church  cannot re-marry them due to canonical law, and he ends up selling the restaurant and having Juan Carlos act the role of a priest at his parents' second wedding.\n\nThe film ends after the wedding, with Rafael opening a new restaurant\u2014the down-on-its-luck location across the street from the old Belvedere\u2014and apologizing to Nati; she joyously forgives him.  Juan Carlos takes a strong interest in Rafael's ex-wife and is shown pulling up a chair, inserting himself between her and her boyfriend, and chatting animatedly.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Ricardo Dar\u00edn]] as Rafael Belvedere\n* [[H\u00e9ctor Alterio]] as Nino Belvedere\n* [[Norma Aleandro]] as Norma Belvedere\n* [[Eduardo Blanco (actor)|Eduardo Blanco]] as Juan Carlos\n* [[Natalia Verbeke]] as Nati\n* Gimena N\u00f3bile as Vicki\n* David Masajnik as Nacho\n* Claudia Font\u00e1n as Sandra\n* Atilio Pozzobon as Francesco\n* Salo Pasik as Daniel\n* Humberto Serrano as Father Mario\n* Fabi\u00e1n Arenillas as Sciacalli\n* [[M\u00f3nica Cabrera]] as Carmen\n* Giorgio Bellora as Marchiolli\n* M\u00f3nica Virgilito as Hospital nurse\n* [[Adri\u00e1n Suar]] as Dodi\n* [[Juan Jos\u00e9 Campanella]] as Doctor\n* [[Alfredo Alc\u00f3n]] as Himself\n\n==Critical reception==\n''Son of the Bride'' garnered mostly positive reviews from film critics.

A witty script, a fleet camera and a pitch-perfect cast keep the movie from being dragged under by the selfishness of its central character...By the end, this crisply agreeable picture has made several points. One, I suppose, is that there are different levels of reconciliation, in troubled families and beleaguered businesses as well as in nations beset by permanent crisis. A more important one, perhaps, is that there's a difference between dropping out and running away.\"<ref>[http://dir.salon.com/story/ent/movies/review/2002/03/22/son_of_bride/ Stark, Jeff].

It is so determined to delve into every cranny of Rafael's world, from his minor business woes to his rekindled friendship with the zany childhood friend with whom he used to play games of Zorro, that it has the feel of an unedited personal journal.\"<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2002/03/22/movies/22BRID.html?ex=1201064400&en=6ab3bfa0ef8a77b5&ei=5070 Holden, Stephen].
