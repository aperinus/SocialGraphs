Kowalski]]. It stars [[Ken Clark (actor)|Ken Clark]], [[Yvette Vickers]] Bruno VeSota and Jan Shepard. The screenplay was written by [[Leo Gordon]]. The film was released by [[American International Pictures]] on a double bill with ''[[A Bucket of Blood]]''. Later, in some areas in 1960, ''Leeches'' played on a double bill with the Roger Corman film ''[[House of Usher (film)|House of Usher]]''.\n\n''Attack of the Giant Leeches'' was one of a spate of \"[[creature feature]]s\" produced during the 1950s in response to [[Cold War]] fears; a character in the film speculates that the [[leech]]es have been mutated to giant size by [[atomic radiation]] from nearby [[Cape Canaveral]].\n\n==Plot==\nIn the [[Florida]] [[Everglades]], a pair of larger-than-human, intelligent leeches live in an underwater cave. They begin dragging locals down to their cave, where they slowly feed on them, draining their victims of blood. Two of the first victims of the leeches are local vixen Liz Walker (Vickers), who has been cheating on her husband (Bruno VeSota), and Liz's latest paramour. [[Game warden]] Steve Benton (Clark) sets out to investigate their disappearance. Aided by his girlfriend, Nan Grayson (Sheppard), and her father, Doc Grayson, Benton discovers the leeches' underwater cavern. The creatures are destroyed when Steve, Doc and several state troopers blow up their underwater cavern using [[dynamite]]. However, in the film's closing moments the leeches distinctive sucking sounds are heard, suggesting they may still be alive.\n\n== Cast ==\n*[[Ken Clark (actor)|Ken Clark]] as Steve Benton\n*[[Yvette Vickers]] as Liz Walker\n*[[Jan Shepard]] as Nan Greyson\n*Michael Emmet as Cal Moulton\n*[[Tyler McVey]] as Doc Greyson\n*[[Bruno VeSota]] as Dave Walker\n*[[Gene Roth]] as Sheriff Kovis\n*[[Dan White (actor)|Dan White]] as Porky Reed\n*[[George Cisar (actor)|George Cisar]] as Lem Sawyer\n*Joseph Hamilton as Old Sam Peters\n*Walter Kelley as Mike\n*Guy Buccola as Giant Leech #1\n*Ross Sturlin as Giant Leech #2\n\n==Production==\nThe film was shot over eight days, including outdoor sequences at the [[Los Angeles County Arboretum and Botanic Garden]]. During filming, Gene Corman came down with pneumonia and wound up in the hospital.<ref name=\"AIP\" />\n\nActress Yvette Vickers had appeared as the [[Playboy Playmate|Playmate]] centerfold in the July 1959 issue of ''[[Playboy]]'' magazine, several months prior to the film's release. \n\nProducers Roger and Gene Corman begged special effects artist [[Paul Blaisdell]] to create the leech costumes for the film, but Blaisdell said the effects budget was so minute, it wouldn't have even covered the cost of the materials he would need to make the creature suits. The costumes were eventually designed by actor Ed Nelson and Gene Corman's wife, each contributing ideas. Some reference sources say the monster suits were constructed from black raincoats that were stitched together, while others say black plastic garbage bags were used.<ref>Palmer, Randy (2009).
