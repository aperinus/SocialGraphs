It stars [[Jackie Chan]], [[Hwang Jang-lee]], and Yuen Woo-ping's real life father, [[Yuen Siu-tien]]. The film's plot is about Chien Fu (Jackie Chan), an orphan who is bullied at a kung fu school, meeting an old beggar, Pai Cheng-tien (Yuen Woo-ping), who becomes his ''[[sifu]]'' (teacher) and trains him in [[Snake Kung Fu]].\n\nRight after this film, Yuen Woo-ping directed ''[[Drunken Master]]'', released in the same year, which also starred Jackie Chan, Hwang Jang-lee and Yuen Siu-tien. The film established Chan's slap-stick [[kung fu film|kung fu]] comedy style which he further developed with ''Drunken Master'', while also establishing the basic plot structure used in many [[martial arts films]] internationally since then.\n\n==Plot==\nChien Fu, an orphan adopted by a [[Chinese martial arts|kung fu]] school, is overworked as their janitor while being bullied and abused by the kung fu teachers as a walking punching-bag, with the school's cook, Ah-Wu, being his only sympathizer. Chien befriends an old beggar  by offering him a meal and a place to stay. Unknown to Chien, the old beggar is actually Pai Cheng-tien, one of the last surviving masters of the [[Snake Kung Fu|Snake-style]] of [[Chinese martial arts|kung fu]]. Pai is on the run from the [[Eagle Claw]] clan, which is viciously killing off all of the rival Snake-style masters, but is ambushed by Eagle Claw student Su Chen and an assassin masquerading as a Christian missionary ([[Roy Horan]]), and is injured. After being abused once more, Chien later finds Pai and helps him recover. Pai agrees to give him more lessons, on the condition that he does not call him \"[[sifu]]\" (\"master\"), since they are friends. The real reason, however, is to keep Chien's connection with him secret from his pursuers.\n\nChien practices the lessons and learns to avoid being hurt by the school's bumbling teachers. When the school is invaded by the [[Northern Praying Mantis (martial art)|Mantis school]], to everyone's amazement Chien easily defeats their master using the snake style. One of the passing wanderers who witnesses the fight is the high master of the Eagle Clan, Sheng Kuan, who recognizes the style at once and decides to tail Chien.\n\nChien meets Shang Kuan, who inquires about the old beggar, claiming that he was a colleague of Pai's. As a show of 'proof', he easily fends off Chien's attacks. Chien realises that his Snake-style fighting is no match for the style practiced by the stranger, and thus creates a new style from watching his pet cat kill a cobra.\n\nLater on the Eagle Claw conspirators track down Pai, who manages to kill Su Chen. He returns to Chien for hiding, but it is then shown that Ah-Wu is also an Eagle Claw conspirator as he puts poison into their tea. Chien rushes to fetch Sheng Kuan, but sensing danger, Pai flees, with his enemy in pursuit. As Chien hurries after them, he finally learns the truth behind the conspiracy, and eventually challenges Sheng Kuan to single combat after Pai is brought down. Apparently at a disadvantage in the initial phase, Chien brings his new 'Cat Claw' technique\u2014against which Sheng Kuan knows no defense\u2014to bear, killing him. When Ah-Wu shows up after the fight and reveals his true allegiance, Chien and Pai trick and slay him, as they have by chance avoided ingesting the poison. Afterwards, the two friends wander off to refine Chien's new technique, giving it its titular name.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Jackie Chan]] \u2013 Chien Fu (as Cheng Lung)\n* [[Hwang Jang-lee]] \u2013 Sheng Kuan\n* [[Yuen Siu-tien]] \u2013 Pai Chang-tien (as Simon Yuen)\n* [[Dean Shek]] \u2013 Teacher Li\n* Fung Hak-on \u2013 Master Chao Chi-chih\n* Tino Wong \u2013 Ah-Wu\n* Peter Chan \u2013 Teacher Lian\n* Hsu Hsia \u2013 Su Chen\n* Charlie Chan \u2013 Master Hung\n* [[Roy Horan]] \u2013 Missionary/Russian\n* Fung Ging-man \u2013 Teacher Chui \n* Chiang Kam \u2013 Ah Kwai\n* Chen Yao-lin \u2013 Master Hung\n* Lung Chen-tien \u2013 Three Provinces Champ\n* Chan Lung \u2013 Substitute Instructor\n* Gam Yam \u2013 Chang\n* Yuen Yat-choh\n* [[Chiu Chi-ling]]\n* Choi Fai\n* Chan Laap-ban\n{{Div col end}}\n\n==Crew==\n{{Div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* Producer: Ng See-yuen\n* Executive Producer: Chang Chuan\n* Screenplay by: Hsi Hua-an, Tsai Chi-kuang, Ng See-yuen\n* Asst.

However, those films yielded relatively poor box office returns. When producer [[Ng See-yuen]] decided to make a comedy with Chan as the star, the concept did not initially meet with approval from the [[film distributor]]s. However, Ng and Chan persevered and together with ''Drunken Master'', this film launched Jackie Chan into national stardom.\n\nThe combination of comedy, martial arts, stunts and acrobatics had been done before, in [[Lau Kar-leung]]'s 1975 film ''Spiritual Boxer''. However, the release of ''Snake in the Eagle's Shadow'' heralded a new direction for Hong Kong action movies.\n\nNg See-yuen and Yuen Woo-ping checked over many actors for the part of the old, eccentric, wandering Kung Fu master, before Ng suggested casting Yuen's own father, [[Yuen Siu-tien]]. Yuen would continue to reprise the role of Beggar So several more times before his death in 1979.\n\nAccording to his book ''[[I Am Jackie Chan: My Life in Action]]'', Chan lost a tooth after Hwang Jang-lee kicked him in the face during a fight scene. His arm was also accidentally slashed by a sword that was supposed to be blunt, but while he was screaming in pain, the camera kept rolling.<ref name=\"I Am Jackie Chan\">{{cite web |url=http://www.randomhouse.com/features/iamjackiechan/excerpt_aches.html |title=Jackie's Aches and Pains: It Only Hurts When I'm Not Laughing |author=Jackie Chan |author-link=Jackie Chan |publisher=[[Random House]] |access-date=2012-12-19}}</ref>\n\n==Music==\nAs well as original music by Chou Fu-liang, the film also features [[Jean Michel Jarre]]'s \"[[Oxyg\u00e8ne]] (Part 2)\" and [[Space (French band)|Space]]'s \"[[Magic Fly]]\". Like many Hong Kong movies of the era, it also includes samples from western movie scores, including ''[[You Only Live Twice (film)|You Only Live Twice]]'', ''[[The Spy Who Loved Me (film)|The Spy Who Loved Me]]'', ''[[Carrie (1976 film)|Carrie]]'', and ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]''.\n\nFilm producer Serafim Karalexis got the rights to distribute the movie in America in the 80s, retitled \"The Eagle's Shadow\". It had a new score made due to copyright issues with the original score. The U.S. film and its promotional materials billed Chan as \"Jacky Chan.\"\n\n==Box office==\nAt the Hong Kong box office, ''Snake in the Eagle's Shadow'' earned [[HK$]]2,708,748.20<ref>{{cite web |title=Snake in the Eagle's Shadow (1978) |url=http://hkmdb.com/db/movies/view.mhtml?id=5863 |website=[[Hong Kong Movie DataBase]] |access-date=7 December 2018}}</ref> ({{US$|{{#expr:2708748.2/4.68 round 0}}|link=yes}}),<ref>{{cite web |title=Official exchange rate (HK$ per US$, period average) |url=https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/PA.NUS.FCRF?end=1978&locations=HK&start=1977 |website=[[World Bank]] |year=1978 |access-date=7 December 2018}}</ref> becoming the 13th-highest-grossing film of the year.<ref>{{cite web |title=\u3010\u30b8\u30e3\u30c3\u30ad\u30fc\u30c1\u30a7\u30f3\u8208\u884c\u6210\u7e3e\u3011 \u7b2c8\u56de\uff1a\u9999\u6e2f\u3067\u306e\u8208\u884c\u53ce\u5165 |trans-title=(Jackie Chan Box Office Results) 8th: Box Office in Hong Kong |url=http://kungfutube.info/3129 |website=KungFu Tube |access-date=22 June 2020 |language=ja}}</ref> In [[South Korea]], it was the second-highest-grossing film of 1979 (behind Jackie Chan's ''[[Drunken Master]]''), with 765,930 box admissions in [[Seoul]],<ref name=\"korea2\">{{cite web |title=\u3010\u30b8\u30e3\u30c3\u30ad\u30fc\u30c1\u30a7\u30f3\u8208\u884c\u6210\u7e3e\u3011 \u7b2c10\u56de\uff1a\u97d3\u56fd\u3067\u306e\u8208\u884c\u53ce\u5165 |url=http://kungfutube.info/3156 |website=KungFu Tube |date=5 September 2010 |access-date=7 December 2018 |language=ja}}</ref> equivalent to an estimated gross revenue of approximately {{KRW|link=yes}}{{formatnum:{{#expr:0.765930*1500 round 2}}|}}{{nbsp}}million<ref>{{cite journal |title=Asian Culture Quarterly |journal=Asian Culture Quarterly |date=1983 |volume=11-12 |page=20 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QLdBAAAAYAAJ |publisher=Asian Cultural Center. |quote=The average admission fee in 1979 was 1,000 won for national films and 1,500 won for imports.

''Snaky Knight Fight Against Mantis'' (or ''Snaky Knight Fights the Mantis'') was released. It was directed by Chang Hsin-yi and starred Wang Tao. However, the film was not a true sequel, rather it was an attempt by the studio to capitalise on the success of the original film. Footage including a montage and a fight scene from ''Snake in the Eagle's Shadow'' were spliced into the film. Chan's image was also used on the cover of some versions.\n\n==Home releases==\n*On 7 February 2000, [[Hong Kong Legends]] released a DVD containing a number of extras, including a photo gallery, Jackie Chan and Hwang Jang-lee's biographies/filmographies, the English export trailer, and an interview with producer [[Ng See-yuen]]. However, it contains a cropped 2:35:1 to 1:78:1 image and the incorrect [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]] dub with [[dubtitle]]s. This DVD contains compulsory [[BBFC]] cuts amounting to roughly 45 seconds due to [[animal cruelty]]. The Chinese credit sequence is used (reverting to 2:35:1 during this section). The English dub is one created by US studios during the film's release there (under the title \"The Eagle's Shadow\") to avoid copyright issues with music, but everything else is the same as the export dub commissioned by Seasonal Films.\n*On 18 June 2002, [[Destination Films]] released the first [[legal]] [[DVD]] in the [[United States]]. Despite having uncut status and a full 2:35:1 image in the correct Cantonese language, it still contains dubtitles. The English dub (and credit sequence) is the export one and intact.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/3966/snake-in-the-eagles-shadow/ |title=Snake in The Eagle's Shadow : DVD Talk Review of the DVD Video |publisher=Dvdtalk.com |access-date=2014-02-07}}</ref>\n*On 16 February 2004, [[Mei Ah Entertainment]] released a remastered [[DVD]] in [[Hong Kong]].

They both follow a similar plot structure, with Chan's character being an underdog trained by Yuen Siu-tien's beggar character. Dawn Taylor of ''The DVD Journal'' also notes that the film's plot structure has been \"copied oh-so-many times by a variety of ''[[Karate Kid]]''-type [[American films]]\" since the 1980s.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Taylor |first1=Dawn |title=Quick Reviews: Snake in the Eagle's Shadow |url=http://www.dvdjournal.com/quickreviews/s/snakeintheeaglesshadow.q.shtml |website=The DVD Journal |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020810202019/www.dvdjournal.com/quickreviews/s/snakeintheeaglesshadow.q.shtml |archive-date=10 August 2002 |access-date=29 October 2021}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Jackie Chan filmography]]\n* [[List of Hong Kong films]]\n* [[List of martial arts films]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{IMDb title|0078252}}\n*{{Amg movie|15065}}\n*{{rotten-tomatoes|snake_in_the_eagles_shadow}}\n*[http://www.hkcinemagic.com/en/movie.asp?id=458 Hong Kong Cinemagic]\n\n{{Yuen Woo-ping}}\n\n[[Category:1978 films]]\n[[Category:1978 martial arts films]]\n[[Category:1970s action comedy films]]\n[[Category:1970s martial arts comedy films]]\n[[Category:1970s Cantonese-language films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Yuen Woo-ping]]\n[[Category:Hong Kong action comedy films]]\n[[Category:Hong Kong martial arts comedy films]]\n[[Category:Kung fu films]]\n[[Category:Slapstick films]]\n[[Category:Wushu films]]\n[[Category:1978 directorial debut films]]\n[[Category:1978 comedy films]]\n[[Category:1970s Hong Kong films]]"}]}}}}
