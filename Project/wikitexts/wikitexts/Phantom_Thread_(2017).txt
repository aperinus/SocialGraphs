His clients view him as a genius whose creations enable them to become their best selves; but his creativity and charm are matched by his obsessive and controlling personality. Cyril, his sister, manages the day-to-day operations of his fashion house and tries to protect him from anything that might distract him from his work. The superstitious Reynolds is haunted by the death of their mother, and often stitches hidden messages into the linings of the dresses he makes.\n\nAfter designing a new gown for a revered client, Lady Harding, Reynolds visits a restaurant near his country house and meets a foreign waitress, Alma Elson. She accepts his invitation to dinner. Their relationship blossoms, and she moves in with him, becoming his model, muse, and lover. Cyril initially distrusts Alma but comes to respect her willfulness and determination.\n\nAt first, Alma enjoys being a part of Reynolds's work, but he proves aloof, hard to please, and finicky; as a result, they start to bicker. When Alma tries to show her love for Reynolds by preparing a romantic dinner, he lashes out, saying he will not tolerate deviations from the routines he has worked hard to perfect. Alma retaliates by poisoning Reynolds's tea with wild mushrooms gathered outside the country house. As he readies a wedding gown for a Belgian princess, Reynolds collapses, damaging the dress and forcing his staff to work all night to repair it. He becomes gravely ill and has hallucinations of his mother.  Alma stays by his side, tirelessly nursing him back to health.\n\nAfter Reynolds recovers, he tells Alma that a house that does not change \"is a dead house,\" and asks her to marry him.  Taken aback, she hesitates but then accepts. Following a pleasant honeymoon in [[Switzerland]], however, Reynolds and Alma start bickering again as Reynolds's domineering personality reasserts itself. Cyril reveals to Reynolds that Lady Harding is now a client at a rival fashion house, and suggests that his classic, conservative designs may be going out of style. Reynolds blames Alma for being more a distraction than an inspiration, and Alma overhears him tell Cyril that it may be time to end the marriage.\n\nAt the country house, Alma makes Reynolds an omelette poisoned with the same mushrooms as before. As he chews his first bite, she informs him that she wants him weak and vulnerable so that he has to depend on her to take care of him. Reynolds willingly swallows the bite and tells her to kiss him before he is sick. As Reynolds lies ill once again, Alma imagines their future with children, a rich social life, and with a bigger role for her in the dressmaking business. She acknowledges that while there may be challenges ahead, their love and their complementary needs can overcome them.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Daniel Day-Lewis]]<ref name=\"Jun2016V\">{{cite news|last1=Kroll|first1=Justin|title=Paul Thomas Anderson, Daniel Day-Lewis Eye Reunion on 1950s Fashion Drama (EXCLUSIVE)|url=https://variety.com/2016/film/news/daniel-day-lewis-paul-thomas-anderson-fashion-movie-1201768423/|access-date=June 6, 2016|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=June 2, 2016|archive-date=May 18, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190518043139/https://variety.com/2016/film/news/daniel-day-lewis-paul-thomas-anderson-fashion-movie-1201768423/|url-status=live}}</ref> as Reynolds Woodcock\n* [[Lesley Manville]]<ref name=\"Feb2017D\">{{cite news|last1=Lodderhose|first1=Diana|title=Focus' New Paul Thomas Anderson Pic Starring Daniel Day-Lewis Adds Lesley Manville & Vicky Krieps|url=https://deadline.com/2017/02/lesley-manville-focus-features-paul-thomas-anderson-focus-features-daniel-day-lewis-1201900101/|access-date=February 2, 2017|work=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|date=February 1, 2017|archive-date=August 13, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180813020021/https://deadline.com/2017/02/lesley-manville-focus-features-paul-thomas-anderson-focus-features-daniel-day-lewis-1201900101/|url-status=live}}</ref> as Cyril Woodcock\n* [[Vicky Krieps]]<ref name=\"Feb2017D\"/> as Alma Elson\n* [[Camilla Rutherford]] as Johanna\n* [[Gina McKee]] as Countess Henrietta Harding\n* George Glasgow as Nigel Cheddar-Goode\n* [[Brian Gleeson (actor)|Brian Gleeson]] as Dr. Robert Hardy\n* [[Harriet Sansom Harris]] as Barbara Rose\n* Lujza Richter as Princess Mona Braganza\n* [[Julia Davis]] as Lady Baltimore\n* [[Nicholas Mander]] as Lord Baltimore\n* [[Philip Franks]] as Peter Martin\n* [[Phyllis MacMahon]] as Tippy\n* [[Silas Carson]] as Rubio Gurrerro\n*[[Ian Harrod]] as the Registrar \n* [[Richard Graham (actor)|Richard Graham]]<ref name=\"Jan2017TFS\">{{cite news|last1=Raup|first1=Jordan|title=Lesley Manville & More Join Paul Thomas Anderson's Next Film; Johnny Greenwood Confirmed to Score|url=https://thefilmstage.com/news/lesley-manville-and-richard-graham-join-paul-thomas-andersons-next-film|access-date=February 2, 2017|work=The Film Stage|date=January 31, 2017|archive-date=October 20, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171020084059/https://thefilmstage.com/news/lesley-manville-and-richard-graham-join-paul-thomas-andersons-next-film/|url-status=live}}</ref> as George Riley\n* [[Jane Perry (actress)|Jane Perry]] as Mrs. Vaughan\n}}\n\n==Production==\nAnderson became interested in the [[Clothing industry|fashion industry]] after reading about designer [[Crist\u00f3bal Balenciaga]].<ref name=\"EW Interview\" /> Reynolds Woodcock's obsessive fastidiousness is loosely inspired by English-American fashion designer [[Charles James (designer)|Charles James]].<ref name=\"inte_Abri\">{{cite web |title=A brief history of Charles James, the designer who inspired Phantom Thread |last=Sharma |first=Jeena |work=[[Interview (magazine)|Interview]] |date=April 25, 2018 |access-date=December 5, 2018 |url=https://www.interviewmagazine.com/fashion/brief-history-charles-james-designer-inspired-phantom-thread |archive-date=December 6, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181206060245/https://www.interviewmagazine.com/fashion/brief-history-charles-james-designer-inspired-phantom-thread |url-status=live}}</ref> Daniel Day-Lewis, a renowned [[method acting|method actor]], spent a year learning dressmaking under the tutelage of Marc Happel in preparation for the role.
