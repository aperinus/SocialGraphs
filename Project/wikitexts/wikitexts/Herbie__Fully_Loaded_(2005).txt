The film features cameos by many [[NASCAR]] drivers, including [[Jeff Gordon]], [[Jimmie Johnson]], [[Tony Stewart]], [[Dale Jarrett]]. It is the sixth and final installment of [[Herbie|''The Love Bug'' film series]], following the 1997 television film ''[[The Love Bug (1997 film)|The Love Bug]]'',{{efn|The 1997 version of The Love Bug was directed by [[Peyton Reed]], who later went on to direct ''[[Bring It On (film)|Bring It On]]'' ''[[Down with Love]]'', ''[[Yes Man (film)|Yes Man]]'' and ''[[Ant-Man (film)|Ant-Man]]''.}} and the only theatrical ''Herbie'' film since ''[[Herbie Goes Bananas]]'' (1980). This film serves as a direct [[sequel]] to the original films. ''Herbie: Fully Loaded'' was released on June 22, 2005 and was a success at the box office grossing over $144 million worldwide despite receiving mixed reviews from critics.{{r|BoxOfficeMojo}}\n\n==Plot==\n[[Herbie]], a [[Volkswagen Beetle]] with a mind of its own, is decommissioned and towed to a junkyard after losing several races. Maggie Peyton is the youngest member of the Peyton racing clan. Her father, Ray Peyton Sr., takes her to the junkyard to buy her a car as a college graduation present, and she chooses Herbie. Herbie then takes Maggie to her mechanic friend Kevin who agrees to take Herbie to a car show to buy parts. Herbie tricks Maggie into disguising herself in a racing suit and helmet and challenging [[NASCAR]] champion Trip Murphy to an impromptu race, which Herbie wins by a hair.\n\nKevin happily suggests that Maggie should race again, but Ray Sr. is concerned, having forbidden Maggie to race due to a [[street racing]] accident years ago. Trip becomes obsessed with Herbie and the mysterious driver and organizes a local racing competition to lure Herbie back for a rematch, which Maggie and Kevin enter. Herbie and Maggie easily defeat the other competitors and qualify for the final match with Trip, but when Trip talks Maggie into [[racing for pinks|racing for pink slips]], Herbie's jealousy over Maggie's desire to win Trip's [[stock car]] causes him and Maggie to lose the race. Maggie is publicly embarrassed, Herbie is towed away, and both Kevin and Ray Sr. express their disappointment with Maggie over her respective actions.\n\nHowever, encouraged by her friend Charisma, Maggie decides to race professionally. She tries to buy Herbie back from Trip, but Trip has entered Herbie in a [[demolition derby]]. Desperate to save Herbie from destruction, Maggie goes to the derby, runs onto the field while the derby is in progress, quickly apologizes and pleads with Herbie to help her, and an overjoyed Herbie accepts her back as his driver; the two manage to escape destruction and win the derby.\n\nMeanwhile, the Peyton racing team may have to forfeit an upcoming [[NASCAR Cup Series|NASCAR Nextel Cup Series]] race due to financial troubles and two crashes by the team's driver and Maggie's brother, Ray Peyton Jr.. Ray Sr. refuses to let Maggie drive for the team, but Ray Jr. decides on his own that she will take his place and sends the Team Peyton crew to help her and Kevin prepare Herbie for the race. At the race track, Maggie and Herbie have a heart-to-heart conversation, and Trip ominously warns Maggie that the race will be dangerous.\n\nHerbie starts the race slowly, but he eventually catches up and begins passing the other cars before Maggie makes her first pit stop. Meanwhile, Ray Sr., who has been watching the race at home, decides to join the crowd in person. On the track again, Herbie is soon boxed in by some other cars, but Ray Sr. arrives at the track and encourages Maggie over the team radio, and Maggie escapes the trap by driving directly over [[Tony Stewart]]\u2019s car in front of her, damaging Herbie's oil system. Maggie makes another pit stop and Kevin hurriedly extracts a replacement part from the yellow [[Volkswagen New Beetle|New Beetle]], which Herbie has been eyeing amorously throughout the film, owned by Sally, one of Team Peyton's few remaining sponsors. The jerry-rigged oil system is fragile, and Trip is intent on preventing Herbie from winning.\n\nWith Maggie, Herbie, and Ray Sr. now working together, Maggie and Herbie catch up to Trip. Trip, bent on defeating Herbie once and for all, tries to damage Herbie by pushing him into the track wall when Maggie tries to pass him, but he is caught off guard and crashes into the wall when she slams on the brakes during his next attempt, resulting in him hitting [[Jeff Gordon]]. Herbie passes Trip's car, now upside down on the track, by climbing onto the fence above the wall. After landing back on the track, Maggie and Herbie win the race, and Maggie becomes the next Peyton to win a NASCAR race. Maggie is congratulated by her father and brother, and Trip is driven away in an ambulance as Maggie and Kevin kiss. The film ends with Ray speaking with Herbie and Sally's New Beetle (which is revealed to have a mind of its own as well), telling them not to stay out too long on their date as Herbie has another race coming up.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Herbie-1138.jpg|thumb|right|Herbie in his \"Street Race\" look]]\n* [[Lindsay Lohan]] as Margaret \"Maggie\" Peyton, a college graduate who later falls for Herbie, before becoming a NASCAR driver at the end of the film\n* [[Justin Long]] as Kevin, Maggie's love interest.\n* [[Matt Dillon]] as Trip Murphy, a NASCAR driver who wants to prevent Herbie from winning.

This circulated false rumors alleging Jones had filmed the cameo and the scene had been deleted.{{r|UltimateDisney}}\n\nSeveral racing personalities appear in cameo roles as themselves, including UNH announcer [[Allen Bestwick]], 1973 NASCAR champion [[Benny Parsons]] and [[ESPN]] broadcaster [[Stuart Scott]]. Various real-life NASCAR drivers and/or their cars from the 2004 racing season can also be seen, including [[Dale Jarrett]], [[Dale Earnhardt Jr.]] (car only), [[Casey Mears]] (car only), [[Kasey Kahne]], [[Jeremy Mayfield]] (car only), [[Tony Stewart]], [[J.

We needed to put Herbie in a much more real world. Not some dopey, illogical, kids-movie world, with characters like the crotchety old junk lot owner twirling his mustache and swearing, 'I'm gonna get that little car if it's the last thing I ever do!!!' Kids hate that kind of stupid shit as much as grown-ups do... We set it in a very realistically portrayed world of San Fernando Valley street racing: a macho world, where an old, beat-up car would get laughed at -- then be totally respected when it won some races.\"<ref name=\"Writing Movies For Fun And Profit\"/>\n\nThey further elucidated on the experience: \"We turned in the first draft, and the movie was greenlit... They were that confident of the movie. Off the first draft... [but] here's where it gets interesting/horrible. We were no longer dealing directly with [then-Disney president Bob Iger]. We were now dealing with a studio executive under the president. ''This executive was not in the room when we sold the pitch. This executive was not there when [Iger] gave us notes on the script...'' This executive had no agenda. This exec wasn't making a power play. This executive just genuinely didn't understand the movie and what [Iger] had liked about it.\"<ref name=\"Writing Movies For Fun And Profit\"/>\n\nPrincipal photography began on August 2, 2004 in [[Los Angeles]]<ref>{{cite web| url-status = live| archive-url = https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211205/LJSUrBdqx20| archive-date = 2021-12-05| url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJSUrBdqx20| title = Lindsay Lohan T4Sunday MeanGirls Interview 2004 | website=[[YouTube]]}}{{cbignore}}</ref> and wrapped up later that same November.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.boxofficeprophets.com/tickermaster/listing.cfm?TMID=1066:Herbie_Fully_Loaded|title=Herbie: Fully Loaded Movie Preview, Starring Lindsay Lohan and Michael Keaton, Directed by Angela Robinson}}</ref> During the [[2005 NASCAR Nextel Cup Series]] season, drivers [[Dale Jarrett]] and [[Scott Riggs]] ran special paint schemes to promote the film.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.jayski.com/2020/04/16/april-16-today-in-jayskis-nascar-history/16/|title=April 16 \u2013 Today in Jayski's NASCAR history|work=[[Jayski's Silly Season Site]]|date=April 16, 2020|access-date=April 17, 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe film began in 2004, was reported to include heavy uses of [[product placement]]. For example, Maggie Peyton is a former reporter for [[ESPN]] (owned by Disney) turned NASCAR driver. A huge billboard for Mid America Motorworks (an aftermarket parts supplier for classic [[Volkswagen]]s and other vehicles) is seen in the background of the scene where Murphy attempts to sabotage Herbie. In addition, Volkswagen provided a [[Volkswagen Touareg]] and a [[Volkswagen New Beetle]] for use in certain scenes, [[General Motors]] also provided the 2005 [[Chevrolet Corvette (C6)|Chevrolet Corvette]] and 2005 [[Pontiac GTO#Fifth generation|Pontiac GTO]] for use in race scenes as well.{{efn|The 2004 Pontiac GTO was a rebadged, third-generation [[Holden Monaro#Third generation (2001\u20132006)|Holden Monaro]].}}{{r|Johnson (2005)}}\n\nVarious race cars in the Nextel Cup Series appear during the race at the end, with action sequences being filmed during the [[2004 Pop Secret 500]] race at [[California Speedway]] in September 4\u20135, 2004. Dale Earnhardt Jr.'s No. 8 car is seen briefly, but it has all the [[Budweiser]] logos removed and replaced with his signature to avoid advertising alcohol in a children's film. In addition, billboards can be seen in straightaway scenes, some with the [[Nextel Communications|NEXTEL]] logo on them. Also, in the scene where Maggie pretends to drive a stock car in the junkyard, Dominic Toretto's 1970 Dodge Charger from ''[[The Fast and the Furious (2001 film)|The Fast and the Furious]]'' can be seen among the cars. [[KITT]] from the classic ''[[Knight Rider]]'' series also makes a cameo in the newspaper during the opening sequence.{{citation needed|date=September 2020}} [[ABC Family]] aired a [[making-of]]\u00a0[[featurette]] titled ''Herbie: Fully Loaded and Retooled'', hosted by Lohan, in June 21, 2005, to promote the film release.{{citation needed|date=September 2020}}\n\n==Reception==\n===Box office===\nIn its opening weekend, the film grossed $12,709,221 in 3,521 theaters in the United States and Canada, ranking number four at the box office.
