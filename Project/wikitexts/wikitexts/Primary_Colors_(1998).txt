Bates was nominated for an [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress]] for her performance, and May was nominated for an [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay]].\n\n==Plot==\nHenry Burton, a young political idealist and grandson of a civil rights leader, is recruited to join the campaign of Jack Stanton, a charismatic Southern governor trying to win the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] nomination for [[President of the United States]].\n\nHenry is impressed by Jack's genuine warmth and empathy. He joins the governor's inner circle of political advisers: Jack's formidable wife, Susan Stanton; unconventional political strategist, Richard Jemmons; intelligent and attractive spokeswoman, Daisy Green; and sly political operator, Howard Ferguson, as they journey to [[New Hampshire]], the first state to hold a [[New Hampshire primary|presidential primary]].\n\nAfter Jack completes an impressive debate performance against his rivals, Henry's ex-girlfriend shows up to question the governor about his arrest for an anti-war protest at the [[1968 Democratic Convention]] in Chicago. Jack called a U.S. senator to help him get released, then persuaded the mayor of Chicago to have his police record expunged. The team becomes worried that Jack's past indiscretions may be used against him by the press and his opponents.\n\nHiring the Stantons' old friend, tough but unbalanced Libby Holden, she investigates allegations, including Jack's notorious womanizing, that could be used by opponents to undermine him. One of these women, also Susan's hairdresser, Cashmere McLeod, produces secret taped conversations between the governor and her, showing they had an affair. Henry discovers the tapes have been doctored, so Libby tracks down the man responsible, forcing him at gunpoint to confess his guilt in a letter to the American public.\n\nThe campaign is then rocked by a fresh allegation when Jack's old friend, \"Fat Willie\" McCollister approaches Henry to tell him that his 17-year-old daughter Loretta, who worked for the Stantons as a babysitter, is pregnant and that Jack is the father. Henry and Howard tell Willie he must allow his daughter to undergo an [[amniocentesis]] to determine paternity. Although they convince Willie to remain silent, Henry is sickened.\n\nRealizing Jack is falling behind in the polls, his team adopt an offensive strategy, attacking his nearest rival, Senator Harris, for casting anti-[[Israel]] votes and favoring cuts in [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] and [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]]. Harris confronts Jack during a radio talk show in Florida but suffers two heart attacks during the encounter. This medical setback causes his withdrawal from the race. He is replaced by his friend, former Florida governor Fred Picker. His wholesome, straight-talking image is an immediate threat to Stanton's campaign.\n\nJack and Susan send Henry and Libby on an [[opposition research]] mission into Picker's past. They discover he had a [[cocaine]] addiction as governor, which led to the disintegration of his first marriage. They also meet with Picker's cocaine supplier, whom Picker had a [[homosexual]] affair with.\n\nNot expecting the information to ever be used, Libby and Henry share the findings with Jack and Susan, but are dismayed when they decide to leak them to the press. Libby says, if Jack does so, she will reveal he tampered with the paternity test results which showed that he had slept with Willie's daughter. Libby commits suicide when realizing she spent her life idealizing Jack and Susan only to learn how flawed they truly are.\n\nRacked with guilt over Libby's death, Jack and Henry take the incriminating information to Picker, and apologize for seeking it out. Picker admits to his past indiscretions, deciding to withdraw from the race and endorse Jack. Henry intends to quit the campaign, as he has become deeply disillusioned with the political process. Jack begs Henry to reconsider, saying they can make history.\n\nMonths later, President Jack Stanton is dancing at the Inaugural Ball with [[First Lady]], Susan. He shakes the hands of his campaign staff, the last of whom is Henry.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[John Travolta]] as [[Governor of Arkansas]] (later [[President of the United States]]) Jack Stanton\n* [[Emma Thompson]] as First Lady of Arkansas (later [[First Lady of the United States]]) Susan Stanton\n* [[Adrian Lester]] as Henry Burton\n* [[Billy Bob Thornton]] as Richard Jemmons\n* [[Kathy Bates]] as Libby Holden\n* [[Maura Tierney]] as Daisy Green\n* [[Paul Guilfoyle]] as Howard Ferguson \n* [[Larry Hagman]] as Governor Fred Picker\n* [[Stacy Edwards]] as Jennifer Rogers\n* [[Diane Ladd]] as Mamma Stanton\n* [[Kevin Cooney]] as Senator Lawrence Harris\n* [[Rebecca Walker]] as March Cunningham\n* [[Caroline Aaron]] as Lucille Kaufman\n* [[Tommy Hollis]] as William \"Fat Willie\" McCollister\n* [[Rob Reiner]] as Izzy Rosenblatt\n* [[Ben L.
