[[Suzanne Somers]], [[Kathleen Quinlan]], [[Debralee Scott]], and [[Joe Spano]] also appear in the film.\n\nThe film is the first movie to be produced by George Lucas' company [[Lucasfilm]].\n\nSet in [[Modesto, California]], in 1962, the film is a study of the [[cruising (driving)|cruising]] and early [[rock and roll|rock 'n' roll]] cultures popular among Lucas's age group at the time. Through a series of [[vignette (literature)|vignettes]], it tells the story of a group of teenagers and their adventures over the course of a night.\n\nWhile Lucas was working on his first film, ''[[THX 1138]]'', Coppola asked him to write a coming-of-age film. The genesis of ''American Graffiti'' took place in Modesto in the early 1960s, during Lucas' teenage years. He was unsuccessful in [[pitch (filmmaking)|pitching]] the concept to financiers and distributors, but found favor at [[Universal Pictures]] after every other major film studio turned him down. Filming was initially set to take place in [[San Rafael, California]], but the production crew was denied permission to shoot beyond a second day. As a result, production was moved to [[Petaluma, California|Petaluma]].\n\n''American Graffiti'' premiered on August 2, 1973, at the [[Locarno International Film Festival]] in Switzerland, and was released on August 11, 1973, in the United States. The film received widespread critical acclaim and was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Picture]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhRG1OzbDJs |title=The Sting Wins Best Picture: 1974 Oscars |website=[[YouTube]] |access-date=August 3, 2019 |archive-date=December 17, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201217022256/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhRG1OzbDJs |url-status=live }}</ref> Produced on a $777,000 budget,<ref name=\"boxoffice\" /> it has become one of the most profitable films ever. Since its initial release, ''American Graffiti'' has earned an estimated return well over $200&nbsp;million in box-office gross and home video sales, not including merchandising. In 1995, the United States [[Library of Congress]] deemed the film \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\" and selected it for preservation in the [[National Film Registry]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Complete National Film Registry Listing |url=https://www.loc.gov/programs/national-film-preservation-board/film-registry/complete-national-film-registry-listing/|access-date=September 15, 2020|website=Library of Congress|archive-date=October 8, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201008184509/https://www.loc.gov/programs/national-film-preservation-board/film-registry/complete-national-film-registry-listing/|url-status=live}}</ref> A sequel, ''[[More American Graffiti]]'', was released in 1979.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, the plot summary should be set from 400-700 words. -->\nOn their last evening of [[summer vacation]] in 1962, high school graduates and friends Curt Henderson and Steve Bolander meet two other friends, John Milner, the drag-racing king, and Terry \"The Toad\" Fields, in the parking lot of [[Mel's Drive-In]] in [[Modesto, California]]. Curt and Steve are to travel \"[[Northeastern United States|Back East]]\" the following morning to start college. Curt has second thoughts about leaving Modesto. Steve gives Terry his car to care for until he returns. Laurie, Steve's girlfriend and Curt's sister, arrives. Steve suggests to Laurie that they see other people while he is away to \"strengthen\" their relationship. Though not openly upset, she is affecting their interactions through the night.\n\nCurt, Steve, and Laurie attend the [[First day of school|back-to-high-school]] [[sock hop]]. En route, Curt sees a beautiful blonde woman driving a white [[Ford Thunderbird]]. She mouths the words \"I love you\" to Curt before turning. Curt becomes desperate to find her; one of his friends tells him \"The Blonde\" is the wife of a local jeweler, but Curt does not believe it. After leaving the hop, Curt is coerced by a group of [[greaser (subculture)|greasers]] (\"The Pharaohs\") into hooking a chain to a police car and ripping out its back axle. The Pharaohs tell Curt that \"The Blonde\" is a prostitute, which he does not believe.\n\nTerry and John cruise the strip. Terry picks up flirtatious and rebellious Debbie. John inadvertently picks up Carol, an annoying, precocious 12-year-old who manipulates him into driving her around all night. Bob Falfa is searching out John to challenge him to a race. Steve and Laurie continue to argue and make up through the evening. They finally split and as the story lines intertwine, Bob picks up Laurie.\n\nCurt drives to the radio station to ask disc jockey \"[[Wolfman Jack]]\" to read a message for The Blonde on the air. Curt encounters an employee who tells him the Wolfman does not work there and that the shows are pretaped for replay. The employee accepts the message and promises to try to have the Wolfman air it. As he is leaving, Curt sees the employee talking into the microphone and, hearing the voice, realizes it is the Wolfman, who reads the message, asking The Blonde to meet Curt or call him on the pay phone at Mel's. \n\nBob finds John and goads him into racing. Many follow them to \"Paradise Road\" to watch. As John takes the lead, Bob's tire blows out, causing him to lose control. His car swerves into a ditch, rolls over, and catches fire. Steve and John leap out of their cars and rush to the wreck while Bob and Laurie crawl out and stagger away just before it explodes. Laurie grips Steve tightly as the sun rises and begs him not to leave her. He assures her that he will stay.\n\nCurt is awakened in his car by the pay phone's ringing. The Blonde does not reveal her identity but tells Curt maybe they will meet that night. Curt replies that they probably will not because he is leaving town. At the airfield, Curt says goodbye to his parents, Laurie, Steve, John, and Terry. As the plane takes off, Curt gazes out the window and sees the white Thunderbird driving in parallel to his plane. An [[intertitle]] epilogue reveals that John was killed by a drunk driver in 1964, Terry was reported [[missing in action]] near [[An L\u1ed9c, B\u00ecnh Ph\u01b0\u1edbc|An L\u1ed9c]] in 1965, Steve is an insurance agent in Modesto, and Curt is a writer in Canada.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Richard Dreyfuss]] as Curt Henderson\n* [[Ron Howard]] as Steve Bolander (Credited as Ronny Howard)\n* [[Paul Le Mat]] as John Milner\n* [[Charles Martin Smith]] as Terry \"The Toad\" Fields\n* [[Cindy Williams]] as Laurie Henderson\n* [[Candy Clark]] as Debbie Dunham\n* [[Mackenzie Phillips]] as Carol Morrison\n* [[Wolfman Jack]] as Disc Jockey\n* [[Bo Hopkins]] as Joe \"Little Joe\" Young\n* [[Manuel Padilla, Jr.]] as Carlos\n* [[Harrison Ford]] as Bob Falfa\n* [[Lynne Marie Stewart]] as Bobbie Tucker\n* [[Terry McGovern (actor)|Terry McGovern]] as Mr. Wolfe\n* [[Kathleen Quinlan]] as Peg\n* [[Scott Beach]] as Mr. Gordon\n* Jana Bellan as carhop Budda\n* [[Susan Richardson]] as Judy\n* [[Kay Lenz|Kay Ann Kemper]] as Jane\n* [[Joe Spano]] as Vic\n* [[Debralee Scott]] as Falfa's Girl\n* [[Suzanne Somers]] as \"The Blonde\" In The T-Bird\n}}\n\n==Development==\n===Inspiration===\nDuring the production of ''[[THX 1138]]'' (1971), producer [[Francis Ford Coppola]] challenged co-writer/director George Lucas to write a script that would appeal to mainstream audiences.<ref name=first/> Lucas embraced the idea, using his early 1960s teenage experiences [[cruising (driving)|cruising]] in Modesto, California. \"Cruising was gone, and I felt compelled to document the whole experience and what [[Silent Generation|my generation]] used as a way of meeting girls,\" Lucas explained.<ref name=first/> As he developed the story in his mind, Lucas included his fascination with Wolfman Jack. Lucas had considered doing a documentary about the Wolfman when he attended the [[USC School of Cinematic Arts]], but he ultimately dropped the idea.<ref name=Whatev>Baxter, pp. 70, 104, 148, 254</ref>\n\nAdding in semiautobiographical connotations, Lucas set the story in his hometown of 1962 Modesto.<ref name=first/> The characters Curt Henderson, John Milner, and Terry \"The Toad\" Fields also represent different stages from his younger life. Curt is modeled after Lucas's personality during USC, while John is based on Lucas's teenaged [[street racing|street-racing]] and junior-college years, and [[hot rod]] enthusiasts he had known from the [[Kustom Kulture]] in Modesto. Terry represents Lucas's [[nerd]] years as a freshman in high school, specifically his \"bad luck\" with dating.<ref name=personal/> The filmmaker was also inspired by [[Federico Fellini]]'s ''[[I Vitelloni]]'' (1953).<ref name=York>Baxter, pp. 106\u2013118</ref>\n\nAfter the financial failure of ''THX 1138'', Lucas wanted the film to act as a release for a world-weary audience:<ref name=Sturhahn>Sturhahn, Larry (March 1974). \"The Filming of ''American Graffiti''\".

The potential financiers were concerned that [[music licensing]] costs would cause the film to go way over budget. Along with ''[[Easy Rider]]'' (1969), ''American Graffiti'' was one of the first films to eschew a traditional [[film score]] and successfully rely instead on synchronizing a series of popular hit songs with individual scenes.<ref name=Kurtz>{{cite news |author=Ken Plume |url=http://movies.ign.com/articles/376/376873p1.html |title=An Interview with Gary Kurtz |work=[[IGN]] |date=November 11, 2002 |access-date=April 30, 2009 |archive-date=June 29, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090629121040/http://movies.ign.com/articles/376/376873p1.html |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n''THX 1138'' was released in March 1971,<ref name=first>Hearn, pp. 10\u201311, 42\u201347</ref> and Lucas was offered opportunities to direct ''[[Lady Ice]]'', ''[[Tommy (1975 film)|Tommy]]'', or ''[[Hair (film)|Hair]]''. He turned down those offers, determined to pursue his own projects despite his urgent desire to find another film to direct.<ref name=pain/><ref name=sound/> During this time, Lucas conceived the idea for a [[space opera]] (as yet untitled) which later became the basis for his ''[[Star Wars]]'' franchise. At the [[1971 Cannes Film Festival]], ''THX'' was chosen for the [[Directors' Fortnight]] competition. There, Lucas met [[David Picker]], then president of [[United Artists]], who was intrigued by ''American Graffiti'' and Lucas' space opera. Picker decided to give Lucas $10,000 to develop ''Graffiti'' as a screenplay.<ref name=pain/>\n\nLucas planned to spend another five weeks in Europe and hoped that Huyck and Katz would agree to finish the screenplay by the time he returned, but they were about to start on their own film, ''[[Messiah of Evil]]'',<ref name=DVD/> so Lucas hired [[Richard Walter (screenwriter)|Richard Walter]], a colleague from the [[USC School of Cinematic Arts]] for the job. Walter was flattered, but initially tried to sell Lucas on a different screenplay called ''Barry and the Persuasions'', a story of [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] teenagers in the late 1950s. Lucas held firm\u2014his was a story about [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]] teenagers in the early 1960s. Walter was paid the $10,000, and he began to expand the Lucas/Huyck/Katz treatment into a screenplay.<ref name=pain/>\n\nLucas was dismayed when he returned to America in June 1971 and read Walter's script, which was written in the style and tone of an [[exploitation film]], similar to 1967's ''[[Hot Rods to Hell]]''. \"It was overtly sexual and very fantasy-like, with [[chicken (game)|playing chicken]] and things that kids didn't really do,\" Lucas explained. \"I wanted something that was more like the way I grew up.\"<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.achievement.org/autodoc/page/luc0int-1 |title=A Life Making Movies |author=<!--Not stated--> |work=Academy of Achievement |date=June 19, 1999 |access-date=April 22, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509145340/http://www.achievement.org/autodoc/page/luc0int-1 |archive-date=May 9, 2008 |url-status = dead}}</ref> Walter's script also had Steve and Laurie going to Nevada to get married without their parents' permission.<ref name=York/> Walter rewrote the screenplay, but Lucas nevertheless fired him due to their creative differences.<ref name=pain/>\n\nAfter paying Walter, Lucas had exhausted his development fund from United Artists. He began writing a script, completing his first draft in just three weeks. Drawing upon his large collection of vintage records, Lucas wrote each scene with a particular song in mind as its musical backdrop.<ref name=pain>Hearn, pp. 52\u201353</ref> The cost of licensing the 75 songs Lucas wanted was one factor in United Artists' ultimate decision to reject the script; the studio also felt it was too experimental\u2014\"a musical montage with no characters\". United Artists also passed on ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'', which Lucas shelved for the time being.<ref name=sound/>\n\n===Universal Pictures===\nLucas spent the rest of 1971 and early 1972 trying to raise financing for the ''American Graffiti'' script.<ref name=sound>Hearn, pp. 54\u201355</ref> During this time, [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]], [[Paramount Pictures]], [[20th Century Fox]], and [[Columbia Pictures]] all turned down the opportunity to co-finance and distribute the film.<ref name=\"drugs\" /> Lucas, Huyck and Katz rewrote the second draft together, which, in addition to Modesto, was also set in [[Mill Valley, California|Mill Valley]] and [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]]. Lucas also intended to end ''American Graffiti'' showing a title card detailing the fate of the characters, including the death of Milner and the disappearance of Toad in Vietnam. Huyck and Katz found the ending depressing and were incredulous that Lucas planned to include only the male characters. Lucas argued that mentioning the girls meant adding another title card, which he felt would prolong the ending. Because of this, [[Pauline Kael]] later accused Lucas of [[chauvinism]].<ref name=drugs/>\n\nLucas and producer Gary Kurtz took the script to [[American International Pictures]], who expressed interest, but ultimately believed ''American Graffiti'' was not violent or sexual enough for the studio's standards.<ref name=accept>Baxter, pp. 120\u2013123</ref> Lucas and Kurtz eventually found favor at [[Universal Studios|Universal Pictures]], who allowed Lucas total [[artistic control]] and the right of [[final cut privilege]] on the condition that he make ''American Graffiti'' on a strict low budget.<ref name=sound/> This forced Lucas to drop the opening scene in which the Blonde Angel, Curt's image of the perfect woman, drives through an empty drive-in cinema in her Ford Thunderbird, her transparency revealing she does not exist.<ref name=change/>\n\nUniversal initially projected a $600,000 budget  but added an additional $175,000 once producer Francis Ford Coppola signed on. This would allow the studio to advertise ''American Graffiti'' as \"from the man who gave you ''[[The Godfather]]''\". The proposition also gave Universal [[first-look deal]]s on Lucas' next two planned projects, ''Star Wars'' and ''[[Radioland Murders]]''.<ref name=accept/> As he continued to work on the script, Lucas encountered difficulties on the Steve and Laurie storyline. Lucas, Katz, and Huyck worked on the third draft together, specifically on the scenes featuring Steve and Laurie.<ref name=title/>\n\nProduction proceeded with virtually no input or interference from Universal since ''American Graffiti'' was a [[low-budget film]], and executive [[Ned Tanen]] had only modest expectations of its commercial success. However, Universal did object to the film's title, not knowing what \"American Graffiti\" meant;<ref name=title/> Lucas was dismayed when some executives assumed he was making an Italian movie about feet.<ref name=drugs/> The studio, therefore, submitted a long list of over 60 alternative titles, with their favorite being ''Another Slow Night in Modesto''<ref name=title/> and Coppola's ''Rock Around the Block''.<ref name=drugs/> They pushed hard to get Lucas to adopt any of the titles, but he was displeased with all the alternatives and persuaded Tanen to keep ''American Graffiti''.<ref name=title>Hearn, pp. 58\u201360</ref>\n\n==Production==\n===Casting===\nThe film's lengthy casting process was overseen by [[Fred Roos]], who worked with producer Francis Ford Coppola on ''The Godfather''.<ref name=DVD/> Because ''American Graffiti'''s main cast was for younger actors, the casting call and notices went through numerous high-school drama groups and community theaters in the [[San Francisco Bay Area]].<ref name=personal/> Among the actors was [[Mark Hamill]], the future [[Luke Skywalker]] in Lucas' ''Star Wars'' trilogy.<ref name=change/>\n\nOver 100 unknown actors auditioned for Curt Henderson before Richard Dreyfuss was cast; George Lucas was impressed with Dreyfuss' thoughtful analysis of the role,<ref name=personal/> and as a result, offered the actor his choice of Curt or Terry \"The Toad\" Fields.<ref name=change/> Roos, a former casting director on ''[[The Andy Griffith Show]]'', suggested Ron Howard for Steve Bolander; Howard accepted the role to break out of the mold of his career as a child actor.<ref name=personal>Hearn, pp. 56\u201357</ref> Howard would later appear in the very similar role of [[Richie Cunningham]] on the ''[[Happy Days]]'' sitcom.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cj5LfIhSaoIC&pg=PA184|title=Last Season of Innocence: The Teen Experience in the 1960s By Victor Brooks|quote=Happy Days began airing only a few months after Graffiti came out, and much of the plotline revolved around Howard's character, Richie Cunningham, who was almost an exact clone of Steve in the film.|isbn=9781442209176|last1=Brooks|first1=Victor|year=2012|access-date=January 21, 2015|archive-date=June 9, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150609084755/https://books.google.com/books?id=cj5LfIhSaoIC&pg=PA184|url-status=live| publisher=Rowman & Littlefield}}</ref> [[Bob Balaban]] turned down Terry out of fear of becoming typecast, a decision he later regretted.

Producer Coppola encouraged Lucas to cast Wolfman Jack as himself in a [[cameo appearance]]. \"George Lucas and I went through thousands of Wolfman Jack phone calls that were taped with the public,\" Jack reflected. \"The telephone calls [heard on the broadcasts] in the motion picture and on the soundtrack were actual calls with real people.\"<ref name=title/>\n\n===Filming===\nAlthough ''American Graffiti'' is set in 1962 Modesto, Lucas believed the city had changed too much in ten years and initially chose [[San Rafael, California|San Rafael]] as the primary shooting location.<ref name=change/> Filming began on June 26, 1972.

Two cameras were used simultaneously in scenes involving conversations between actors in different cars, which resulted in significant production time savings.<ref name=Wex/> After [[CinemaScope]] proved to be too expensive,<ref name=change/> Lucas decided ''American Graffiti'' should have a [[documentary film|documentary]]-like feel, so he shot the film using [[Techniscope]] cameras. He believed that Techniscope, an inexpensive way of shooting on [[35mm movie film|35 mm film]] and using only half of the film's frame, would give a perfect widescreen format resembling [[16 mm film|16 mm]]. Adding to the documentary feel was Lucas's openness for the cast to [[improvisation|improvise]] scenes. He also used [[goof]]s for the final cut, notably Charles Martin Smith's arriving on his scooter to meet Steve outside Mel's Drive-In.<ref name=Verna/> [[Jan D'Alquen and Ron Eveslage]] were hired as the cinematographers, but filming with Techniscope cameras brought lighting problems. As a result, Lucas commissioned help from friend [[Haskell Wexler]], who was credited as the \"visual consultant\".<ref name=Wex>Hearn, pp. 61\u201363</ref>\n\n===Editing===\nLucas had wanted his wife, [[Marcia Lucas|Marcia]], to edit ''American Graffiti'', but Universal executive Ned Tanen insisted on hiring [[Verna Fields]], who had just finished editing [[Steven Spielberg]]'s ''[[The Sugarland Express]]''.<ref>Baxter, pp. 132\u2013135.</ref> Fields worked on the first [[rough cut]] of the film before she left to resume work on ''[[What's Up, Doc? (1972 film)|What's Up, Doc?]]''. After Fields's departure, Lucas struggled with editing the film's story structure. He had originally written the script so that the four (Curt, Steve, John, and Toad) storylines were always presented in the same sequence (an \"ABCD\" plot structure). The first cut of ''American Graffiti'' was three and a half hours long, and to whittle the film down to a more manageable two hours, many scenes had to be cut, shortened, or combined. As a result, the film's structure became increasingly loose and no longer adhered to Lucas's original \"ABCD\" presentation.<ref name=Verna/> Lucas completed his final cut of ''American Graffiti'', which ran 112 minutes, in December 1972.<ref name=Jesus/> [[Walter Murch]] assisted Lucas in post-production for [[audio mixing (film and television)|audio mixing]] and [[sound design]] purposes.<ref name=Verna>Hearn, pp. 64\u201366</ref> Murch suggested making Wolfman Jack's radio show the \"backbone\" of the film. \"The Wolfman was an ethereal presence in the lives of young people,\" said producer Gary Kurtz, \"and it was that quality we wanted and obtained in the picture.\"<ref name=\"Marcia\">Baxter, pp. 129\u2013135.</ref>\n\n==Soundtrack==\n{{Main|41 Original Hits from the Soundtrack of American Graffiti}}\nThe choice of music was crucial to the mood of each scene; it is [[diegetic music]] that the characters themselves can hear and therefore becomes an integral part of the action.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.filmmusicnotes.com/diegetic-music-non-diegetic-music-and-source-scoring/ |title=Richards, Mark.

Universal wanted Lucas and producer Gary Kurtz to hire an orchestra for [[sound-alike]]s. The studio eventually proposed a flat deal that offered every music publisher the same amount of money. This was acceptable to most of the companies representing Lucas' first choices, but not to [[RCA]]\u2014with the consequence that [[Elvis Presley]] is conspicuously absent from the soundtrack.<ref name=sound/> Clearing the [[music licensing]] rights had cost approximately $90,000,<ref name=Marcia /> and as a result, no money was left for a traditional [[film score]]. \"I used the absence of music, and sound effects, to create the drama,\" Lucas later explained.<ref name=Jesus/>\n\nA [[soundtrack album]] for the film, ''[[41 Original Hits from the Soundtrack of American Graffiti]]'', was issued by [[MCA Records]]. The album contains all the songs used in the film (with the exception of \"Gee\" by the Crows, which was subsequently included on a second soundtrack album), presented in the order in which they appeared in the film.\n\n==Release==\nDespite unanimous praise at a January 1973 [[test screening]] attended by Universal executive Ned Tanen, the studio told Lucas they wanted to re-edit his original cut of ''American Graffiti''.<ref name=Jesus>Hearn, pp. 67\u201369</ref> Producer Coppola sided with Lucas against Tanen and Universal, offering to \"buy the film\" from the studio and reimburse it for the $775,000 (equivalent to ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|0.775|1972|r=1}}}}&nbsp;million in {{Inflation-year|US}}){{Inflation-fn|US}} it had cost to make it.<ref name=San/> 20th Century Fox and Paramount Pictures made similar offers to the studio.<ref name=Whatev/> Universal refused these offers and told Lucas they planned to have [[William Hornbeck]] re-edit the film.<ref name=France/>\n\nWhen Coppola's ''[[The Godfather]]'' won the [[Academy Award for Best Picture]] in March 1973, Universal relented and agreed to cut only three scenes (amounting to a few minutes) from Lucas' cut.
