He is offered a job of pasting advertising bills but tells Maria that he cannot accept because the job requires a bicycle. Maria resolutely strips the bed of her [[dowry]] bedsheets{{mdashb}}prized possessions for a poor family{{mdashb}}and takes them to the [[pawn shop]], where they bring enough to redeem Antonio's pawned bicycle.\n\nOn his first day of work, Antonio is atop a ladder when a young man (Vittorio Antonucci) snatches the bicycle. Antonio gives chase but is thrown off the trail by the thief's confederates. The police warn that there is little they can do. Advised that stolen goods often surface at the [[Piazza Vittorio Emanuele II (Rome)|Piazza Vittorio]] market, Antonio goes there with several friends and Bruno. They find a bicycle that might be Antonio's, but the serial numbers do not match.\n\nAt the [[Porta Portese]] market, Antonio and Bruno spot the thief with an old man. The thief eludes them and the old man feigns ignorance. They follow him into a church where he too slips away from them.\n\nIn a subsequent encounter with the thief, Antonio pursues him into a brothel, whose denizens eject them. In the street, hostile neighbors gather as Antonio accuses the thief, who conveniently falls into a fit for which the crowd blames Antonio. Bruno fetches a policeman, who searches the thief's apartment without success. The policeman tells Antonio the case is weak{{mdashb}}Antonio has no witnesses and the neighbors are certain to provide the thief with an alibi. Antonio and Bruno leave in despair amid jeers and threats from the crowd.\n\nOn their way home, they are walking near [[Stadio Nazionale PNF]] football stadium. Antonio sees an unattended bicycle near a doorway and after much anguished soul-searching, instructs Bruno to take the [[tram]] to a stop nearby and wait.  Antonio circles the unattended bicycle and jumps on it. Instantly the [[hue and cry]] is raised and Bruno{{snd}}who has missed the tram{{snd}}is stunned to see his father pursued, surrounded and pulled from the bicycle. As Antonio is being muscled toward the police station, the bicycle's owner notices Bruno and in a moment of compassion tells the others to release Antonio.\n\nAntonio and Bruno then walk off slowly amid a buffeting crowd. Antonio fights back tears and Bruno takes his hand. The camera watches from behind as they disappear into the crowd.\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\">\nFile:Ladri di biciclette - immagine .jpg|First day {{nobr|on the job}}\nFile:Ladri-biciclette-pioggia.jpg|In search of the {{nobr|stolen bike}}\nFile:Ladri-biciclette folla.jpg|The thief's neighbors {{nobr|threaten Antonio}}\nFile:Ladri-biciclette.jpg|All seems lost\nFile:Ladri di biciclette (film).jpg|The bike redeemed, the {{nobr|family saved}}\n</gallery>\n\n==Cast==\n{|\n|\n* [[Lamberto Maggiorani]] as Antonio Ricci\n* [[Enzo Staiola]] as Bruno Ricci, Antonio's son\n* [[Lianella Carell]] as Maria Ricci, Antonio's wife\n* Gino Saltamerenda as Baiocco, Antonio's friend who helps search\n* Vittorio Antonucci as Alfredo Catelli the Bicycle thief\n* Giulio Chiari as a Beggar\n* [[Elena Altieri]] as the Charitable Lady\n* [[Carlo Jachino]] as a Beggar\n* Michele Sakara as the Secretary of the Charity Organization\n* Emma Druetti\n* [[Fausto Guerzoni]] as an Amateur Actor\n* Giulio Battiferri as a Citizen Who Protects the Real Thief (uncredited)\n|\n* Ida Bracci Dorati as La Santona (uncredited)\n* [[Nando Bruno]] (uncredited)\n* Eolo Capritti (uncredited)\n* [[Memmo Carotenuto]] (uncredited)\n* [[Giovanni Korporaal|Giovanni Corporale]] (uncredited)\n* [[Sergio Leone]] as a Seminary Student (uncredited)\n* Mario Meniconi as Meniconi, the Street Sweeper (uncredited)\n* Massimo Randisi as a Rich Kid in the Restaurant (uncredited)\n* [[Checco Rissone]] as a Guard in Piazza Vittorio (uncredited)\n* [[Peppino Spadaro]] as a Police Officer (uncredited)\n* [[Umberto Spadaro]] (uncredited){{Citation needed|date=June 2012}}\n{{nbsp}}<!--dummy line for even columns-->\n|}\n\n==Production==\n''Bicycle Thieves'' is the best-known work of [[Italian neorealism]], the movement that formally began with [[Roberto Rossellini]]'s ''[[Rome, Open City]]'' (1945) and aimed to give cinema a new degree of realism.<ref>[http://www.greencine.com/static/primers/neorealism1.jsp Megan, Ratner] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070810033724/http://www.greencine.com/static/primers/neorealism1.jsp |date=2007-08-10 }}.

He wrote, \"Again the Italians have sent us a brilliant and devastating film in Vittorio De Sica's rueful drama of modern city life, ''The Bicycle Thief.'' Widely and fervently heralded by those who had seen it abroad (where it already has won several prizes at various film festivals), this heart-tearing picture of frustration, which came to [the World Theater] yesterday, bids fair to fulfill all the forecasts of its absolute triumph over here. For once more the talented De Sica, who gave us the shattering ''[[Shoeshine (film)|Shoeshine]]'', that desperately tragic demonstration of juvenile corruption in post-war Rome, has laid hold upon and sharply imaged in simple and realistic terms a major{{mdash}}indeed, a fundamental and universal{{mdash}}dramatic theme. It is the isolation and loneliness of the little man in this complex social world that is ironically blessed with institutions to comfort and protect mankind\".<ref name=NYT/> Pierre Leprohon wrote in ''Cin\u00e9ma D'Aujourd'' that \"what must not be ignored on the social level is that the character is shown not at the beginning of a crisis but at its outcome. One need only to look at his face, his uncertain gait, his hesitant or fearful attitudes to understand that Ricci is already a victim, a diminished man who has lost his confidence.\" [[Lotte Eisner]] called it the best Italian film since World War II and Robert Winnington called it \"the most successful record of any foreign film in British cinema.\"<ref name=\"Wakeman. pp. 232\"/>\n\nWhen the film was re-released in the late 1990s Bob Graham, staff film critic for the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'', gave the drama a positive review: \"The roles are played by non-actors, Lamberto Maggiorani as the father and Enzo Staiola as the solemn boy, who sometimes appears to be a miniature man. They bring a grave dignity to De Sica's unblinking view of post-war Italy. The wheel of life turns and grinds people down; the man who was riding high in the morning is brought low by nightfall. It is impossible to imagine this story in any other form than De Sica's.
