It stars [[David Hewlett]] and [[Andrew Miller (actor)|Andrew Miller]].\n\n==Plot==\nThe film tells the story of two good friends and housemates, Andrew, an [[Agoraphobia|agoraphobic]] travel agent, and Dave, a loser who works in an office. Dave is fired from his job after his girlfriend frames him for [[embezzlement]], Andrew is falsely accused of attempted [[sexual harassment|child molestation]], and their house is to be demolished by day's end. Both of them hide inside the house as police, city officials, and outraged neighbors surround it.  Dave and Andrew open their front door and discover that the entire world beyond their house is gone, replaced with a featureless white void.\n\nEventually, after a simple test reveals that the nothingness surrounding them holds a flat, featureless, and somewhat springy surface \"like tofu\", they set out across the empty plane in order to explore their new surroundings, leaving items behind as a means of getting back.  After running out of items to leave as a trail, they lose track of their path.  Wandering leads them to what appears to be another house, but they have simply wandered back home.\n\nPanic begins to set in again when Andrew realizes that the house is completely out of food.  Andrew glances around the room, eventually stopping and glaring at a noisy clock on the wall; within a few seconds it disappears. Andrew drops a stack of overdue bills in front of Dave, and within seconds the bills abruptly disappear - they realize the clock, the bills, and the entire outside world have all disappeared because they were objects of their hate, and that concentrating their hate on things somehow makes them disappear. Dave puts the theory to test, managing to hate away his need for food.\n\nDave still expresses some concern over Andrew's remaining phobias, questioning why the phobias still exist when there is nothing left to fear.  Reluctantly, Andrew reveals that he was abused and tormented by his parents as a child.  With some urging from Dave he hates away the memory of each traumatic childhood event as he recounts it; when he is finally done he is no longer phobic and much more confident in himself.  Unfortunately this change alters Andrew's personality and leads to friction between the two friends, finally building into an outright confrontation.  They decide they can no longer share the same house, and opt to determine who keeps it by playing a match of their favorite fighting game.  Dave loses, and is exiled with his possessions to reside out in the nothingness.\n\nThings become very tense with Dave's departure.  Dave attempts to engage Andrew in conversation repeatedly, even performing the national anthem for his self-created nation (its borders marked by a line of his possessions), all to no avail.  After several days Dave comes into Andrew's house much happier and explains his sudden change of mood: he has hated away his anger at Andrew; all Andrew needs to do is hate away his anger at Dave and things will be back to normal.  Andrew refuses, quite content to be angry at Dave.  Dave hates away his anger several times as Andrew rebuffs and outright insults him, but his patience finally wears thin, leading Dave to hate away one of Andrew's possessions.  Andrew retaliates by hating away one of Dave's possessions, and the situation escalates until everything including the house is hated away.\n\nDave walks away, assuming the argument is finished, but falls over suddenly as his feet begin to disappear; Andrew is hating them away.  He turns and retaliates, hating away Andrew's legs, and the situation escalates again until all that is left of the two are their disembodied heads.  Refusing to give up the fight, Andrew and Dave manage to turn themselves and (by bouncing) charge at each other, headbutting each other repeatedly until they finally stop, exhausted.  Their anger abated, Dave and Andrew make up, agree to be best friends again, and set off to explore the nothingness.  As they bounce away into the white void they remark how they both had always thought that their bodies were somehow holding them back.\n\nIn a [[post-credits scene]], an obviously older Dave and Andrew \u2013 still disembodied heads \u2013 are sleeping when they are awakened by a popping sound, followed by a loud clamoring of voices and noise.  As the unseen source of the clamoring gets louder and closer the two scream.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[David Hewlett]] as Dave \n* [[Andrew Miller (actor)|Andrew Miller]] as Andrew \n* [[Gordon Pinsent]] as Man In Suit \n* [[Marie-Jos\u00e9e Croze]] as Sara \n* [[Andrew Lowery]] as Crawford \n* [[Elana Shilling]] as Little Girl \n* [[Soo Garay]] as Little Girl's Mother \n* Martin Roach as Co-worker \n* [[Angelo Tsarouchas]] as Foreman \n* [[Rick Parker (actor)|Rick Parker]] as Mounted Police Officer \n* [[Maurice Dean Wint]] as Narrator\n* Bobby the Turtle as Stan<ref name=\"thetrades\" />\n\n==Production==\n{{cquote|A lot of people said 'you can never make a movie set solely in one room' and they may have been right, but I did ''[[Cube (1997 film)|Cube]]''.

But we didn't have enough money to build a talking turtle. Now, I think Stan really exists as a silent commentator, who observes these fools with amused detachment -- or at least that's what you project onto him when watching the movie.

Due to budget constraints, however, the idea of a talking turtle could not be realized. Natali also associated Stan with a metaphorical significance: \"He's a turtle because that's what David and Andrew are -- creatures who carry their home on their back and hide from the world.\"<ref name=\"thetrades\" />\n\nIn an email interview with Patrick Douglas of ''The Culture Shock'', Natali attributed his desire to make ''Nothing'' to a fascination with the \"notion of editing reality.\" He explained the decision to keep the leading actors' real names in the script as \"Creative bankruptcy.\"<ref name=cultureshock>{{cite web|last=Douglas|first=Patrick|title='Nothing,' 'Cube' - Vincenzo Natali|url=http://www.thecultureshock.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=602&Itemid=49|work=thecultureshock.com|publisher=The Culture Shock|accessdate=10 April 2011|date=1 May 2005|quote=I became fascinated with this notion of editing reality.

In an interview with Ian Caddell of ''[[The Georgia Straight]]'', Natali recalled how Hewlett and Miller had to enact many of the scenes in ''Nothing'' hanging from the ceiling on wires. But, he said, they enjoyed the abuse because they knew it could be the last opportunity the three would have to work together.<ref>{{cite web|last=Caddell|first=Ian|title=Work With Old Friends Results in Nothing'|url=https://www.straight.com/article/work-with-old-friends-results-in-nothing|work=straight.com|publisher=[[The Georgia Straight]]|accessdate=10 April 2011|date=22 July 2004|quote=Because the characters have to live inside a world that has no ground or sky, the actors had to spend much of the shooting schedule suspended from the ceiling on wires, with their environment, such as it was, added in postproduction.

Some critics at TIFF complained about having to spend time in the company of two crazed losers who bicker as if they were Waiting ''for Godot''{{'}}s Vladimir and Estragon with Xbox addictions. But ''Nothing'' is so playful and bizarre -- thanks in large part to the terrific effects by CORE Digital Pictures -- it needs that abrasive edge in order to stay grounded in more familiar human realities.
