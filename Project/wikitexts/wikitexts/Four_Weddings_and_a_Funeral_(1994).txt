At the reception, Charles becomes smitten with Caroline (Carrie), a young American, and they spend the night together. In the morning, Carrie jokingly demands that Charles propose to her, observing they might have \"missed a great opportunity\", and then leaves for the U.S.\n\nThree months later, at the wedding of Bernard and Lydia in London \u2013 who became involved at the previous wedding \u2013 Charles meets Carrie again, who is now accompanied by her fianc\u00e9 Hamish. Charles faces further humiliation from several of his ex-girlfriends, including the distraught Henrietta, and retreats to an empty hotel suite, where he watches Carrie and Hamish depart. He becomes trapped in the room when the newlyweds stumble in to have sex. Later, he is confronted by an angry Henrietta about his habit of \"[[serial monogamy]]\" and his fear of letting anyone get too close. Carrie reappears, and she and Charles spend another night together.\n\nA month later, Charles receives an invitation to Carrie's wedding. While shopping for a gift, he runs into her and helps select a wedding dress. She recounts her 33 sexual partners; Charles, who was number 32, soon awkwardly confesses his love to her, but is unsuccessful.\n\nA month later, Charles and his friends attend Carrie's wedding in Perthshire. The gregarious Gareth instructs the group to seek potential mates; Scarlett hits it off with an American, Chester. As Charles watches Carrie and Hamish dance, Fiona deduces his heartbreak. When he asks Fiona why she is single, she confesses that she has [[Love at first sight|loved Charles since they first met]]; though sympathetic to her feelings, Charles does not reciprocate them. During the bridegroom's toast, Gareth suddenly dies of a heart attack.\n\nAt Gareth's funeral, Matthew recites the poem \"[[Funeral Blues]]\" by British-American poet [[W. H. Auden]], commemorating his relationship with Gareth and calling Auden \"another splendid bugger\". Afterward, Carrie and Charles share a brief moment, and Charles and Tom ponder the fact that despite their [[clique]]'s pride in being single, Gareth and Matthew were a \"married\" couple all the while, and whether the search for \"one true love\" is futile.\n\nTen months later, Charles's own wedding day arrives; the bride turns out to be Henrietta. Tom, while seating guests, is struck with [[love at first sight]] with his distant cousin Deirdre, whom he had met 25 years before when they were children. Shortly before the wedding ceremony, Carrie arrives and tells Charles that she and Hamish have separated. He has a crisis of confidence and is counselled by David and Matthew, but proceeds with the wedding. When the [[vicar]] asks for any reason why the couple should not marry, however, the deaf David says in [[British Sign Language|sign language]] that he suspects the bridegroom loves someone else, which Charles confirms. Henrietta angrily punches him, and the wedding is stopped.\n\nCarrie tries to apologise to Charles, who confesses that, at the altar, he realised she was the one person he truly loved, and that he has loved her since [[Love at first sight|the first second he met her]]. Charles, who [[Specific social phobia|fears marriage]], proposes a lifelong commitment without marriage to Carrie, and she accepts it by saying \"I do\". As they kiss a thunderbolt flashes across the sky.\n \nHenrietta marries an officer in the [[Grenadier Guards]]; David marries his girlfriend Serena, whom he met at the second wedding; Scarlett marries Chester; Tom marries Deirdre; Matthew finds a new partner; Fiona is shown in a picture with [[Prince Charles]]; and Charles and Carrie have a baby.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Hugh Grant]] as Charles\n* [[Andie MacDowell]] as Carrie\n* [[James Fleet]] as Tom\n* [[Simon Callow]] as Gareth\n* [[John Hannah (actor)|John Hannah]] as Matthew\n* [[Kristin Scott Thomas]] as Fiona\n* [[David Bower]] as David\n* [[Charlotte Coleman]] as Scarlett\n* [[Timothy Walker (actor)|Timothy Walker]] as Angus\n* [[Sara Crowe]] as Laura\n* [[Rowan Atkinson]] as Father Gerald\n* [[David Haig]] as Bernard Delaney\n* [[Sophie Thompson]] as Lydia Hibbot\n* [[Corin Redgrave]] as Hamish Banks\n* [[Anna Chancellor]] as Henrietta\n* [[Rupert Vansittart]] as George\n* Robin McCaffrey as Serena\n* Susanna Hamnett as Deirdre\n}}\n\n==Production==\n===Writing===\nScreenwriter [[Richard Curtis]]'s own experiences as a wedding attendee inspired ''Four Weddings and a Funeral''.<ref name=\"15 Facts\">{{cite news |author=Cormier |first=Roger |date=10 January 2016 |title=15 Splendid Facts About Four Weddings and a Funeral |website=Mentalfloss.com |url=http://mentalfloss.com/article/73509/15-splendid-facts-about-four-weddings-and-funeral |access-date=30 June 2018}}</ref> According to Curtis he began writing the script at age 34, after realising he had attended 65 weddings in an 11-year period.
