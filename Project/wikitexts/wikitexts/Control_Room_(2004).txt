Al Jazeera was represented by [[Samir Khader]], a senior producer, Hassan Ibrahim, a Sudanese journalist who attended U.S. universities and headed the [[BBC]] Arab News Service before joining Al Jazeera, and [[Dima Khatib]], a Syrian journalist and a producer at Al Jazeera.

It received positive reviews from critics, but has been criticized for bias. Noujaim has acknowledged this lack of objectivity, stating \"I am not saying it is the truth, but it is our truth.\"<ref name=\"Al Jazeera in focus\">{{cite web |url= http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2004/dec/8/20041208-094251-7515r/ |title=Al Jazeera in focus |work=The Washington Times |date=December 8, 2004 |accessdate=November 18, 2015}}</ref> The film was nominated for [[Writers Guild of America Award for Best Documentary Screenplay|Best Documentary Screenplay]] from the [[Writers Guild of America Awards 2004|Writers Guild of America]].<ref>{{cite web|title=WGA serves up 1st doc kudo to 'Super'|url=https://variety.com/2005/film/awards/wga-serves-up-1st-doc-kudo-to-super-1117918019/|website=variety.com|publisher=Variety|accessdate=18 February 2019|date=15 February 2005}}</ref>\n\n==Topics==\n\n===Al Jazeera's role in Arab society===\n''Control Room'' documents the spectrum of opinion that surrounds the Qatar television news network [[Al Jazeera]]. Throughout the film, US Secretary of Defense [[Donald Rumsfeld]] appears at press conferences, complaining about the [[propaganda|propagandist]] nature of Al Jazeera. Paradoxically, another clip shows [[Muhammad Saeed al-Sahhaf]], the Iraqi Minister of Information, accusing the television organization of transmitting American propaganda. The contrasting views between the documentary's central figures are not so clear cut. Early in the movie, press officer Lt. Rushing remarks that Al Jazeera's bias leads it to focus exclusively on American tanks and Iraqi casualties, yet he later confides that agencies such as [[Fox News]] also appear to hand-pick their material, and he sees what both sides leave out. Samir Khader, a senior producer of Al Jazeera, claims the network's purpose is to shake up the rigid infrastructure of Arab society, which he believes has fallen behind, culturally and technologically, because of its social intolerance to other cultures and perspectives.\n\n===Bias in the media===\nRushing laments about Al Jazeera's bias, and speculates why the network shows no photos of alleged Iraqi military atrocities, such as soldiers holding families hostage. [[Abdallah Schleifer]], an American reporter, counters that no such pictures exist. He has no doubt these atrocities occur. However, he explains that hearsay filtering down through CentCom is not convincing to skeptical Arab viewers; 'That's why pictures of these things are so vital.'\n\nA crucial point in the documentary comes with Lt. Rushing's realization that Fox News displays that same lack of objectivity which he accuses Al-Jazeera of perpetuating - his conclusion drives home the point that media bias is institutionalized on both sides.\n\nGiven the subject of this film, pictures are so important because they transcend language. Unless there is concern that they have been contrived, they give useful information to all perspectives. This is what a producer for Al Jazeera claims was the motivation for showing dead American soldiers and Iraqi civilians. As for objectivity, she discards it as 'a mirage'. The film concludes that war is something that makes emotionless involvement impossible for any involved party.\n\n===Journalist embedding during Iraq War===\n\nIn an effort to rectify past mishandling of media personnel during wartime and to garner support for the Iraq war, the Pentagon introduced a new journalist embedding policy. The policy allowed media \"long-term, minimally restrictive access to U.S. air, ground and naval forces through embedding.\" In its implementation of the policy, the Pentagon expressed recognition of the media's ability to \"shape public perception of the national security environment now and in the years ahead\u2026 for the U.S. public; the public in allied countries whose opinion can affect the durability of |the| coalition.\" As many as 775 journalists covered the Iraq War as embedded journalists at the start of the Iraq War, meaning that in addition to reporting on military action in Iraq, the journalists were also required to \"live, work, and travel as part of the units.\"  The media embed ground rules introduced in March 2003 stated  \"Our ultimate strategic success in bringing peace and security to this region will come in our long-term commitment to supporting our democratic ideals. We need to tell the factual story-good or bad- before others seed the media with disinformation and distortions,\" (Victoria Clarke, Pentagon spokesperson).\n\n===Freedom of the media===\n\nOne of the central focuses of ''Control Room'' is on the alleged [[friendly fire]] attack against the [[Baghdad]] headquarters of Al Jazeera, on 8 April 2003. The film shows footage of the attack, and film reports that the alleged target was a group of insurgents who opened fire on coalition forces from within the Al Jazeera building, thus justifying retaliatory fire. Much doubt is expressed within as to whether such an explanation is viable. During the attack, one correspondent working for the news network, [[Tarek Ayyoub]], was killed; the film records one subsequent episode during a press conference, when Ayyoub's widow beseeches journalists to 'tell the truth' concerning her husband's death, for the sake of those innocents already killed during the war.\n\nThe same day that witnessed the attacks on Al Jazeera also saw attacks on other news networks: a strike by US troops on the Palestine Hotel in Baghdad killed a [[Spain|Spanish]] TV cameraman and a [[Reuters]] cameraman. Claims that US troops were returning fire upon a sniper were \"greeted with incredulity by reporters on the ground, including [[Sky News]] reporter David Chater, and at Central Command in [[Qatar]].\"<ref name=\"byrne-2003\">{{cite news\n| url = https://www.theguardian.com/media/2003/apr/09/pressandpublishing.iraq\n| title = Iraq - the most dangerous war for journalists\n| newspaper = [[The Guardian]]\n| first = Ciar |last=Byrne\n| date = April 9, 2003\n| accessdate = December 7, 2010\n| location=London\n}}</ref>\nOn the same day, [[Abu Dhabi]] TV was also hit, \"which means the US forces [had] attacked all the main western and Arab media headquarters in the space of just one day.\"<ref name=\"byrne-2003\" /> Charter also said that, \"Al Jazeera is the best Channel in the world.\" {{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}\n\nThe aftermath of the attack saw a number of allegations: Al Jazeera claimed to have sent the [[The Pentagon|Pentagon]] details of their staff's position via [[GPS]] co-ordinates, as did several other news networks.

After weeks waiting for approval in Al Jazeera's guard office, the filmmakers finally received an audience with Al Jazeera's General Manager, [[Mohammad Jassem]] through [[Abdallah Schleifer]], one of Salama's professors from the [[American University in Cairo]].<ref>Noujaim, Jehane.

There, Noujaim and Salama discovered both [[Samir Khader]] and Hassan Ibrahim, not only central characters to the film but also crucial to gaining the crew access into Al Jazeera. Noujaim explains, \"We also met Hassan in the cafeteria over many cups of coffee and many cigarettes, and he was really the person that was responsible for getting us such amazing access to Al Jazeera. I think he was the first person that believed in what we were doing. And he went to the General Manager and said 'Look, I'll take of them. They won't get into the way. They'll just be following me around'\" (Noujaim, Audio Commentary). Noujaim and Salama often recorded footage simultaneously, capturing multiple angles or locations for the same moment using the [[Sony DCR-VX1000|Sony DCR-VX2000]] and Sony DSR-PD150 [[miniDV]] cameras.<ref name=\"WRMEA\">{{cite journal |url= http://www.wrmea.org/2004-september/control-room%C2%9D-views-war-on-iraq-through-al-jazeeras-lenses.html |title=\"Control Room\" Views War on Iraq Through Al-Jazeera's Lenses |first=Pat McDonnell |last=Twair |journal=[[Washington Report on Middle East Affairs]] |date=September 2004 |pages=50\u201351 |accessdate=18 November 2015}}</ref> Despite having a small production, the lack of lighting or formal setup, granted extra flexibility, allowing Noujaim to follow the pace of the Al Jazeera newsroom and focus more on her subjects. Noujaim explains, \"Sometimes it's a good thing to walk around with a broomstick as a boom and your camera half broken. Y'know, look like a very low budget, non-threatening production, and be small\" (Noujaim, Audio Commentary).\n\n==Production==\n''Control Room''  was originally to be funded by the [[BBC]], but Noujaim's plan of documenting Al-Jazeera covering the war was passed along to BBC director Ben Anthony, who later produced Al Jazeera Exclusive. One of the reasons Noujaim's film is titled ''Control Room'' is that Anthony got exclusive access to the newsroom, which left her to shoot elsewhere, including the control room.<ref name=\"Stamets\">{{cite web |url=http://sensesofcinema.com/2004/feature-articles/control_room/ |title=Channelling Democracy: Control Room |first=Bill |last=Stamets |date=October 2004 |work=[[Senses of Cinema]] |accessdate=November 18, 2015}}</ref>\nNoujaim says she wanted to be at the center of news creation and make a film on the broader perceptions of the war, a reason why she headed to [Al Jazeera]'s headquarters in Doha, which was barely 15 miles away from the Central Command, the military base of the United States. Before leaving for Cairo, when Noujaim called her agents in Hollywood, she was told this was the worst idea ever \"since after 9/11 people did not want to watch war, but things that were comforting to them.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.milton.edu/news/Jehane-Noujaim.cfm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100528131446/http://www.milton.edu/news/Jehane-Noujaim.cfm |url-status=dead |archive-date=2010-05-28 |title=Jehane Noujaim |work=[[Milton Academy]]}}</ref>\nNoujaim had raised $US60,000 for the film and says she did the film \"as cheaply as she could\". She rented an inexpensive Pakistani hotel in Doha and called upon her cinematographer friend Hani Salama to join the project.

Noujaim wanted to \"convey surprise, confusion, discovery -- reproduce her own process in making the film\". Four editors of different ethnic and cultural backgrounds volunteered their time for six months to complete editing of the film. Payback for everyone involved in the film depended on how well the documentary was received.<ref name=\"WRMEA\"/> Noujaim says she edited her movie both in Egypt and in the US, as the contrast between the worlds became central to her understanding of the war.<ref>{{cite news |url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A44966-2004Jun15.html |title=In 'Control Room,' The Splitting Image of War Coverage |first=Philip |last=Kennicott |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |date=June 16, 2004 |accessdate=November 18, 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Cin\u00e9ma v\u00e9rit\u00e9 genre==\n''Control Room'' is a [[Cin\u00e9ma v\u00e9rit\u00e9]] film which attempts to present an un-narrated behind-the-scenes focus on the functioning of Al-Jazeera and of the US Central Command during the Iraq War.
