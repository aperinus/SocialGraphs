It is inspired by the 2002 novel ''[[Fingersmith (novel)|Fingersmith]]'' by Welsh writer [[Sarah Waters]], with the setting changed from [[Victorian era]] Britain to [[Korea under Japanese rule|Korea under Japanese colonial rule]].\n\nThe film was selected to compete for the [[Palme d'Or]] at the [[2016 Cannes Film Festival]]. It was released in South Korea on 1 June 2016. The film received critical acclaim, with praise for its performances, direction, and writing. It grossed over $38 million worldwide. At the [[71st British Academy Film Awards]], the film won the category of [[BAFTA Award for Best Film Not in the English Language|Best Film Not in the English Language]].\n\n==Plot==\n===Part 1===\nIn [[Korea under Japanese rule|Japanese-occupied Korea]], a con man operating under the [[sobriquet]] of \"Count [[Fujiwara clan|Fujiwara]]\" plans to seduce a Japanese heiress named Lady Hideko, then marry her and commit her to an asylum in order to steal her inheritance. He hires a pickpocket named Sook-hee to become Hideko's maid and encourage Hideko to marry him.\n\nHideko lives with her Uncle Kouzuki, a Korean man who [[Chinilpa|helped the Japanese take over his country]] in exchange for a gold mine. Kouzuki then uses this wealth to feed his obsession with rare books, selling forgeries to further accumulate money and books. Sook-hee's main job is to help Hideko prepare to read for Kouzuki's guests. Returning frustrated from a reading, Hideko demands Sook-hee sleep next to her. The two end up making love, under the pretext of preparing Hideko for her married life with the Count. Sook-hee begins expressing reluctance about the plan, but when Hideko herself suggests she loves someone other than the Count, Sook-hee insists on the marriage. Hideko slaps her and violently throws her from the room.\n\nWhen Kouzuki leaves on business for a week, Hideko and Fujiwara elope. After cashing out Hideko's inheritance, it is revealed that Hideko's na\u00efvet\u00e9 was part of the con. She and Fujiwara double-crossed Sook-hee and convinced the asylum that she is the \"Countess\" to have her committed in Hideko's stead.\n\n===Part 2===\nA series of flashbacks show that Hideko's \u201creading practice\u201d was in fact Kouzuki teaching her to erotically read sadistic pornography since she was five years old. The flashbacks show a regimen of psychological and physical abuse that gradually degrades the sanity of Hideko's aunt, who is eventually found hanged from a tree in the yard, and so Hideko takes over as the reader for the auctions. When Hideko questions the description of a hanging in a book she has to read, Kouzuki tells her that he murdered her aunt using torture devices in the basement after she attempted to run away.\n\nIn the more recent past, the Count realizes seducing Hideko would be impossible and instead includes her in the plan to elope and then split her inheritance. When Hideko expresses her fear of her uncle, the Count gifts her a vial of opium with which to commit suicide, so that she can never be taken to the basement alive. Hideko demands the Count find her a girl to hire as a maid, to commit to an asylum in Hideko's place.\n\nWhile being instructed by the Count, who takes advantage of Sook-hee's illiteracy, Hideko unexpectedly falls in love with her. Hideko tries to confess her love, but when Sook-hee insists the marriage go on, Hideko throws her from the room and tries to hang herself. Sook-hee saves her and both admit to their plots. Hideko helps Sook-hee write a letter to her family to say she has teamed up with Hideko, and to hatch a plot to get Hideko and Sook-hee away from the men who have been manipulating them. Hideko shows Sook-hee the books she was forced to read and Sook-hee begins destroying the library. Hideko calls Sook-hee \"her savior\" and joins in destroying her uncle's collection.\n\n===Part 3===\nAfter leaving Sook-hee at the asylum, Fujiwara and Hideko eat together, where Fujiwara wants Hideko to marry him again, this time as Sook-hee, as they have switched identities. He also reveals that Sook-hee will be dead within a few days, causing Hideko to question Fujiwara's desires. Sook-hee's friend Bok-soon sets a fire at the asylum and poses as a firefighter to rescue Sook-hee. Hideko doses Fujiwara's wine with drops from the opium vial, causing him to pass out while she takes the money and leaves. The women reunite and flee together, disguising Hideko as a man to avoid detection.\n\nKouzuki captures Fujiwara upon receiving a letter from Hideko detailing Fujiwara's deception. He tortures Fujiwara in his cellar with his collection of antique bookmaking tools and presses him for sexual details about his niece. Fujiwara makes up a story about making love on their wedding night, while a flashback shows that he watched Hideko masturbate before cutting her own hand on a knife to stain her sheets, refusing to consummate the marriage. When Kouzuki presses for more details, Fujiwara convinces him to give him one of his cigarettes, after which he disgustedly refuses to give further details. Kouzuki notices the cigarettes are producing blue smoke. Fujiwara reveals that his cigarettes had been laced with mercury and the toxic gas within the smoke kills them both.\n\nOn a ferry to [[Shanghai]], [[Republic of China (1912\u20131949)|China]], Sook-hee and Hideko celebrate their newfound freedom by making love once again.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Kim Min-hee (actress, born 1982)|Kim Min-hee]] as Lady / Izumi Hideko\n* [[Kim Tae-ri]] as Maid / Nam Sook-hee\n* [[Ha Jung-woo]] as Count Fujiwara\n* [[Cho Jin-woong]] as Uncle Kouzuki\n* [[Kim Hae-sook]] as Madame Sasaki\n* [[Moon So-ri]] as Hideko's aunt\n* Lee Yong-nyeo as Bok-soon\n* [[Lee Dong-hwi]] as Goo-gai\n* Jo Eun-hyung as young Hideko\n* Rina Takagi as Hideko's mother\n* Han Hannah as Junko\n* [[Lee Ji-ha]] as Owner of Ryokan\n* [[Jeong Ha-dam]] as Housemaid\n* [[Choi Byung-mo]] as Audience member\n}}\n\n==Production==\nIn December 2014, it was reported that Kim Min-hee, Kim Tae-ri, Ha Jung-woo and Cho Jin-woong signed on for the film.<ref name=fingersmith2014>{{cite web|first1=June|last1=Kim|title=KIM Min-hee and KIM Tae-ri Confirmed for FINGERSMITH|url=http://www.koreanfilm.or.kr/jsp/news/news.jsp?mode=VIEW&seq=3255|website=Korean Film Biz Zone|access-date=16 May 2016|date=1 December 2014}}</ref> Kim Tae-ri was selected from 1,500 candidates to play the role.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Jin|first1=Eun-soo|title=''The Handmaiden'' generates a buzz|url=http://koreajoongangdaily.joins.com/news/article/Article.aspx?aid=3018243|website=[[Korea JoongAng Daily]]|access-date=10 May 2016|date=3 May 2016}}</ref> Shooting for the film began in June 2015 and concluded in October 2015.<ref>{{cite web|title=''Oldboy'' Director Park Chan-wook Starts Lesbian ''Fingersmith'' Adaptation|url=https://variety.com/2015/film/asia/park-chan-wook-lesbian-fingersmith-1201524738/|access-date=November 14, 2015|date=June 21, 2015|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|last1=Kil|first=Sonia}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=First Look at Park Chan-wook's Fingersmith Adaptation The Handmaid|url=https://www.joblo.com/movie-news/first-look-at-park-chan-wooks-fingersmith-adaptation-the-handmaid-248|access-date=November 14, 2015|date=November 3, 2015|work=[[JoBlo.com]]|last=Giroux|first=Jesse}}</ref>\n\nThe books ''[[The Dream of the Fisherman's Wife]]'' and ''[[Jin Ping Mei]]'' were featured in the film.<ref name=\"economistreview\"/>\n\n=== Locations ===\nThe film was shot in both Japan and Korea.
