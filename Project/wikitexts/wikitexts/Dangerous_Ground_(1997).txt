He is unable to bring himself to slaughter a cow as part of the funeral ritual. Vusi's younger brother Ernest, a former soldier, constantly berates him for his choice to run away to U.S. instead of taking part in \"the struggle\". This angers Vusi, who tells Ernest: \"I was in the struggle while you were still pissing in your pants.\" While talking with his mother, Vusi wonders why his youngest brother Steven was not at the funeral. His mother admits that they have not seen Steven in a while. She provides Vusi with two addresses and sends him out to find Steven.\n\nThe first address Vusi checks is Steven's apartment in [[Johannesburg]], where he meets his brother's neighbor Karen ([[Elizabeth Hurley]]). He gives her his contact information, in case she hears anything. After checking the second address, Vusi starts driving out of [[Soweto]]. He is confronted by three armed thugs who take his car, jacket, and shirt. The thugs also break his father's spear, a family heirloom. Vusi returns to his hotel and calls his fianc\u00e9e to tell her what has happened to him. He receives a note from Karen telling him to meet her at The Summit Club.\n\nAt the club, Vusi discovers Karen's occupation as a [[stripper]]. She reports hearing noises, coming from Steven's apartment. After the show, the pair returns to the apartment complex and decides to check the room. Karen climbs along the outside of the building to Steven's open window, where a thug attacks her. The thug flees, knocking over Vusi in his escape. The encounter causes Vusi to wonder what is actually going on with Steven. Karen finally confesses that Steven had borrowed [[cocaine]] on \"credit\" from a drug dealer named Muki ([[Ving Rhames]]). Steven was initially planning to sell the drug and make enough money for Karen and him to travel to the United States and visit Vusi. Steven instead took the money and drugs for himself.\n\nWith the truth revealed, Karen suggests they check out the local clubs to see if they can find any leads. At a [[Hard rock|hard-rock]] club Vusi finds out about Karen's [[crack cocaine]] addiction, after watching her take a hit from a pipe. He confronts her about it, and suspects she was the one who got Steven hooked on the drug. The duo are accosted by [[White supremacy|white supremacist]] punks outside the club. Two of thugs pin Vusi to a wall at gunpoint, while the leader of the gang hits Karen for associating with a \"[[Kaffir (racial term)|kaffir]]\". Vusi manages to get the upper hand on the punks, while Karen grabs the gun and hands it over to Vusi. Vusi holds the leader of the punks at gunpoint, before knocking him out and pistol-whipping the other punk. Back at the apartment, Karen asks Vusi to visit her drug dealer and purchase a gram of crack for her. Or else, she will not tell him anything else about Steven. Vusi reluctantly accepts her terms .\n\nKaren's drug dealer, Sam, is initially suspicious of Vusi. He becomes relaxed when Vusi reveals that he knows Karen. Sam tells Vusi that Muki will not allow him to sell to Karen. Muki reportedly suspects that Karen and Steven may be working together to hide the money. Sam charges an extra 50 dollars and tells Vusi to stay in the apartment. Vusi answers the door to find Steven, who flees from him down an alley. Vusi returns to the apartment, where he is confronted by a switchblade-wielding Sam. Sam demands to know why he left. Vusi pulls a gun and forces Sam over to the window, interrogating him on the whereabouts of Muki. Sam replies \"you don't find Muki, Muki finds you.\" Sam returns the money to Vusi, along with the drugs Karen asked for.\n\nVusi heads back to Karen's place. Karen learns that Vusi revealed his status as Steven's brother to Sam. She figures that Muki will find out about the connection and becomes paranoid. They leave her apartment and head towards Vusi's hotel room. The next morning, Vusi drops Karen back at her apartment. He is then confronted by one of Muki's men in his car. The car is stopped by more of Muki's men, and Vusi is captured. He is placed in the trunk of a car.

He threatens to have the entire Madlazi family killed to settle the debt. But he will agree to spare Steven's life and leave them alone, if Vusi is able to bring him 15,000 U.S. dollars in two days.\n\nKaren tells Vusi that Steven headed for [[Sun City, South Africa|Sun City]], in order to gamble back the money he needs to pay back the debt.

Karen heads up to Steven's room with him. Steven shoots up over half a gram of crack into his arm. An arriving Vusi locates Steven and becomes angry at Karen, for allowing his brother to become an addict. He calms down and the trio leaves the casino.\n\nVusi is only able to get 14,100 dollars to pay back Muki. The trio heads off to the hotel to pay off the debt anyway. Steven yells at Muki for trashing his apartment, but is told to shut up by Vusi. Muki is pleased with the money Vusi was able to bring him. Vusi promises to pay him the rest of the money by the next day. Muki tells Steven that the word is out that people can mess with Muki, and that he must send a message despite their deal. Muki then shoots Steven with Vusi's gun, which had been confiscated on the way in. A man in the apartment, who is revealed to be a detective sergeant, is disgusted at Muki's actions.

She lets off a burst by her rifle into the ceiling, giving Vusi an opportunity to approach Muki and stab him with his father's spear. Muki is stabbed three times in the stomach, and falls out of a window and onto a car below. The trio flee the building as police show up to investigate the crime scene.\n\nAt the end of the film, Vusi convinces his fianc\u00e9e to come to South Africa and settle in his village.
