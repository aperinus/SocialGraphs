It was directed by Michael Austin, and written by Austin and [[John Wells (satirist)|John Wells]].  The story is based on the real-life 19th-century character [[Princess Caraboo]], who passed herself off in British society as an exotic princess who spoke a strange foreign language.  It stars [[Phoebe Cates]].\n\n==Plot==\nIn [[Regency England]], an exotically dressed woman is found in the fields, speaking a language no-one can understand. She ends up at the home of the Worrall family, the local gentry.\n\nTheir Greek butler, Frixos, thinks the woman is a fraud from the start. Mr Worrall sends her to the magistrate to be tried for vagrancy, but Mrs Worrall agrees to care for her.  Mr Gutch, a local printer and newspaper reporter, takes an interest in the case, especially after the woman claims via [[mime]] to be  [[Princess Caraboo]].\n\nGutch talks to the farm workers who found her and learns she had a book from the Magdalene Hospital in London on her. When the Worralls leave on a trip the servants inspect her for a [[tattoo]], which they believe all natives of the [[South Seas]] have and are shocked to find Princess Caraboo has one on her thigh.\n\nFrixos tells Gutch he now thinks Princess Caraboo's a genuine princess. Mr Worrall uses her presence to recruit investors for the spice trade which will be facilitated by her when she returns to her native land. Gutch brings in Professor Wilkinson, a linguist who is initially dismissive of Caraboo's story but has enough doubt to refuse to say she is a fraud.\n\nThe local society finds Princess Caraboo fascinating and they flock to attend parties and soirees with her. Mr Gutch begins investigating people connected with the Magdalene House. Lady Apthorpe takes Caraboo to a ball held for the [[George IV of the United Kingdom|Prince Regent]], who is fascinated by her.\n\nGutch learns Caraboo is actually Mary Baker, who worked as a servant for Mrs Peake. He sneaks into the ball to warn her she's been found out, but she refuses to acknowledge what he tells her. Mrs Peake comes and confronts Caraboo and identifies her as Mary Baker. She is locked up.\n\nThe local magistrate and Mr Worrall want to hang her. Mrs Worrall gives Mr Gutch documents implicating her husband and the magistrate in a bank fraud. He uses these to work a trade, he will bury the story if Mary Baker can go to America. Gutch, who has fallen in love with Mary, leaves with her for the United States.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Phoebe Cates]] as [[Princess Caraboo]]\n* [[Jim Broadbent]] as Mr. Worrall\n* [[Wendy Hughes]] as Mrs. Worrall\n* [[Kevin Kline]] as Frixos\n* [[John Lithgow]] as Professor Wilkinson\n* [[Stephen Rea]] as Gutch\n* [[Peter Eyre]] as Lord Apthorpe\n* [[Jacqueline Pearce]] as Lady Apthorpe\n* [[John Wells (satirist)|John Wells]] as Reverend Wells\n* [[John Lynch (actor)|John Lynch]] as Amon McCarthy\n* [[John Sessions]] as Prince Regent\n* [[Arkie Whiteley]] as Betty\n* [[Jerry Hall]] as Lady Motley\n* [[Anna Chancellor]] as Mrs. Peake\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Reception==\n''Princess Caraboo'' received mixed reviews.
