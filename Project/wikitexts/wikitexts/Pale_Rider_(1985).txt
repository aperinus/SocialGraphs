The title is a reference to the [[Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse]], as the pale horse's ghost rider (Eastwood) represents [[Death]]. The film, which took in over $41&nbsp;million at the box office, became the highest-grossing Western of the 1980s.<ref name=thr>{{cite news|first=Mike |last=Barnes |title=Dennis Shryack, Screenwriter on Clint Eastwood's 'The Gauntlet' and 'Pale Rider,' Dies at 80 |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/dennis-shryack-dead-pale-rider-929500 |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |date=September 15, 2016 |access-date=October 5, 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nIn the [[Old West]], outside LaHood, California in Carbon Valley, mining baron Coy LaHood is waging a war of intimidation against independent prospectors and their families, including Hull Barret who is courting Sarah Wheeler. Sarah's teenaged daughter, Megan, prays for deliverance from LaHood after a gang of his men attack the mining camp and kill her dog. Shortly afterward, a man atop a pale horse rides into Carbon Valley. When Hull heads to town to pick up supplies, four of Lahood's men beat him with axe handles before the stranger fights them off with his own axe handle. Hull then invites his rescuer to dinner and, while the stranger is washing, notices what appears to be six bullet wounds in his back. When the stranger arrives at the dining table, he is wearing a [[clerical collar]] and is thereafter referred to as \"Preacher\". Coy LaHood's son, Joshua, attempts to scare off the Preacher with a gigantic workman named Club. Preacher, however, disables Club with a sledgehammer blow to the groin.\n\nCoy returns from [[Sacramento]], learns of the Preacher's arrival, and unsuccessfully attempts to bribe and then threaten him. At Preacher's suggestion, LaHood then offers the miners $1,000 per claim provided they evacuate within 24 hours. LaHood says he plans to hire the services of a corrupt [[United States Marshals Service|marshal]] named Stockburn to clear them out if they refuse. The miners ultimately reject LaHood's offer, despite Preacher warning them about Stockburn. Megan expresses her love for Preacher, but he gently rebuffs her. Megan angrily assumes Preacher is really in love with Sarah. LaHood's men dam the creek forcing the miners to mine a dry bed. Megan rides into LaHood's camp, where Joshua shows her the blasting operation before he attempts to rape her. Preacher arrives on horseback, disarms Joshua and shoots him through the hand.\n\nStockburn and his deputies arrive in LaHood. Coy gives him a rough description of the Preacher, which startles Stockburn, because the man Coy is describing is dead. Spider Conway, one of the miners and Coy's former partner, discovers a large gold nugget in the dry creek bed and rides into town with his teenage sons, where he yells drunken abuse at LaHood from the street. Stockburn and his deputies gun him down, and Stockburn sends a message that he wants Preacher to meet him in town the next morning. Sarah begs Preacher not to go, and tells him she will marry Hull, despite her feelings for Preacher.\n\nThe following day, Preacher and Hull blow up LaHood's mining site with dynamite. To stop Hull from following him, Preacher scares off Hull's horse and rides into town alone. In the gunfight that follows, he kills all but the two of LaHood's men who run away, and then, one by one, all six of Stockburn's deputies. Finally, Preacher kills Stockburn who recognizes him in disbelief before he is shot in the head. LaHood, watching from his office, aims a rifle at the Preacher but is shot dead by Hull.\n\nPreacher nods at Hull and rides off toward the snow-capped mountains. Megan arrives and, seeing Preacher riding away, shouts her love and thanks to him.\n\n==Cast==\n[[Image:PaleRider1.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Clint Eastwood as the Preacher]]\n* [[Clint Eastwood]] as The Preacher\n* [[Michael Moriarty]] as Hull Barret\n* [[Carrie Snodgress]] as Sarah Wheeler\n* [[Richard Dysart]] as Coy LaHood\n* [[Chris Penn]] as Josh LaHood\n* [[Sydney Penny]] as Megan Wheeler\n* [[John Russell (actor)|John Russell]] as Marshal Stockburn\n* [[Richard Kiel]] as \"Club\"\n* [[Doug McGrath]] as \"Spider\" Conway\n* Chuck Lafont as Eddie Conway\n* [[Billy Drago]] as Deputy Mather\n* [[Jeffrey Weissman]] as Teddy Conway\n* [[Charles Hallahan]] as McGill\n* Marvin J.

Viewers are left to draw their own conclusions regarding the overall story line and its meaning.\n\nThe movie's title is taken from the [[Book of Revelation]], chapter 6, verse 8: \"And I looked, and behold a pale horse: and his name that sat on him was Death, and Hell followed with him.\" The reading of the biblical passage describing this character is neatly choreographed to correspond with the sudden appearance of the Preacher, who arrived as a result of a prayer from Megan, in which she quoted [[Psalm 23]]. Preacher's comment after beating one of the villains is, \"Well, the Lord certainly does work in mysterious ways.\" After Coy offers to let him establish a lucrative ministry in his town, the Preacher replies, \"You can't serve God and [[Mammon]] both, Mammon being money.\"<ref name = Marsh>Clive Marsh, Gaye Ortiz, [https://books.google.com/books?id=IIW1Wvtm1GEC&pg=PA68&lpg=PA68&dq=#v=onepage&q&f=false ''Explorations in theology and film: movies and meaning''], Blackwell Publishers 1997 (reprint 2001), p. 68</ref> According to Robert Jewett, the film's dialogue parallels [[Paul the Apostle]]'s teaching on [[divine retribution]] (Romans 12:19\u201321).<ref name = Marsh/>\n\n== Reception ==\n=== Box office ===\n''Pale Rider'' was released in the United States in June 1985 and became one of the highest-grossing Westerns of the 1980s,{{sfn|Hughes|2009|p=38}} grossing $41,410,568<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=palerider.htm |title=Pale Rider (1985) |access-date=September 21, 2010 |work=[[Box Office Mojo]] |publisher=[[IMDb.com, Inc.]]}}</ref> against a $6,900,000 budget.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mooviees.com/732-pale-rider/movie |title=Pale Rider movie info |access-date=September 21, 2010 |work=Mooviees! |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110930232058/http://www.mooviees.com/732-pale-rider/movie |archive-date=September 30, 2011 |year=2002}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Disasters Outnumber Movie Hits |newspaper=[[South Florida Sun-Sentinel]] |date=September 4, 1985 |url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1985-09-04/features/8502060585_1_ticket-million-box-office |access-date=June 5, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181014021400/http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1985-09-04/features/8502060585_1_ticket-million-box-office |archive-date=October 14, 2018}}</ref> It was the first mainstream Hollywood Western to be produced after the massive financial failure of ''[[Heaven's Gate (film)|Heaven's Gate]]'' (1980).\n\n===Critical response===\nOn [[Rotten Tomatoes]] the film has an approval rating of 93% based on reviews from 29 critics.<ref>{{cite web |title= Pale Rider (1985) |url= https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/pale_rider |website= [[Rotten Tomatoes]] }}</ref> On [[Metacritic]] the film has a score of 61% based on reviews from 13 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".<ref>{{cite web |title= Pale Rider |url= https://www.metacritic.com/movie/pale-rider |website= [[Metacritic]] }}</ref>\n\nThe review in ''[[The New York Times]]'' praised Clint Eastwood's performance: \"This veteran movie icon handles both jobs [lead actor and director] with such intelligence and facility I'm just now beginning to realize that, though Mr. Eastwood may have been improving over the years, it's also taken all these years for most of us to recognize his very consistent grace and wit as a film maker,\" concluding that \"it's so evocative of a fabled time and place that it never allows the movie to self-destruct in parody.
