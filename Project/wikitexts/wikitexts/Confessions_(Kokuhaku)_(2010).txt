It was awarded Best Picture at the 34th [[Japan Academy Prize (film)|Japan Academy Prize]] and 53rd [[Blue Ribbon Awards]] and was shortlisted at the [[83rd Academy Awards]] for [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film|Best Foreign Language Film]].\n\n==Plot==\nJunior high school teacher Yuko Moriguchi ([[Takako Matsu]]) announces to her rowdy, disrespectful class that she will resign before spring break. She explains that because the [[HIV]]-positive father of her four-year-old daughter Manami was ill, she used to bring the girl to school with her. One day, Manami was found drowned in the school swimming pool. She explains that two students in her class, whom she dubs \"Student A\" and \"Student B\", had murdered her daughter. Yuko had found a small bunny purse among Manami's belongings which did not belong there, which led her to question Shuya Watanabe, one of her students. Shuya, Student A, immediately admitted to killing Manami, then mocked her compassionate reaction with, \"Just kidding.\"\n\nHaving revealed their identities, Yuko explains that because the killers, as minors, are protected by the [[Law of Japan#Criminal law|Juvenile Law of 1947]], turning them in wouldn't make a difference. As a teacher, she believes she must teach them a lesson by making them amend for their mistakes. Yuko reveals she injected Manami's father's HIV-contaminated blood in the milk cartons of the two students she claims murdered Manami. The rest of the film switches between the aftermath of Yuko's confession and the events before the confession through first-person narratives from Yuko and three of her students. Naoki Shimomura, Student B, becomes a [[Hikikomori|shut-in]] because he believes he has contracted [[AIDS]] from drinking the contaminated milk. His mother realizes her son was involved in Manami's death and decides to commit [[murder-suicide]] to free the both of them from their torment. However, in the ensuing struggle, Naoki kills his mother and the police arrest him. Meanwhile, Shuya explains that his mother abused him before leaving to pursue her scientific career. Her abandonment drove him to thrive in science, from making small inventions to recording his killing and [[dissection|dissecting]] of animals.\n\nShuya's first public invention, an electric anti-mugger wallet, earned him a science fair award, but failed to make headlines as the media was distracted by the \"Lunacy Murder\" case. He upgraded the anti-mugger wallet, decided to try it out on someone, and roped Naoki in to help. They decided to test the wallet on Yuko's daughter, but when they did so, the girl was rendered unconscious. Shuya mistook this as death. Enraged, Naoki threw Manami into the pool where she drowned, proving that he was the real killer. Classmate Mizuki Kitahara tells Shuya that she believes Yuko lied about the contaminated milk as it was an implausible method of transmission. Mizuki eventually confesses to him that she identifies with the girl in the \"Lunacy Murder\" case, who poisoned her parents. The two become romantically involved, but Shuya kills Mizuki after a confrontation over his abandonment complex.\n\nShuya visits the university where his mother works, expecting to reunite with her, but discovers she has remarried. Believing she has forgotten him, he plants a bomb in his school where the graduation ceremony is to be held and he is to give a speech. To his surprise, the bomb seemingly does not go off. Shuya then receives a call from Yuko, who says that she had relocated the bomb to his mother's office. She explains that it is her ultimate revenge, to let Shuya's mother die by his own hands, and claims that with her revenge completed, Shuya's path to redemption has begun. As the screen darkens, Yuko chuckles and says, \"Just kidding.\"\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Takako Matsu]] as Yuko Moriguchi\n* [[Masaki Okada]] as Yoshiteru Terada (Werther)\n* [[Yoshino Kimura]] as Yuko Shimomura\n* Yukito Nishii as Shuya Watanabe\n* Kaoru Fujiwara as Naoki Shimomura\n* [[Ai Hashimoto]] as Mizuki Kitahara\n* [[Mana Ashida]] as Manami Moriguchi\n\n==Reception==\n===Box office===\nSoon after the film had started showing in 266 cinemas, it had already grossed \u00a5269,835,200 with 194,893 audiences, breaking the record previously held by ''[[I Give My First Love to You]]''.
