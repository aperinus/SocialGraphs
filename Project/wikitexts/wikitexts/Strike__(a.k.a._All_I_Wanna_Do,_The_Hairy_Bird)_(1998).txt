It stars [[Kirsten Dunst]], [[Gaby Hoffmann]], [[Monica Keena]], [[Heather Matarazzo]] and [[Rachael Leigh Cook]] in an [[ensemble cast]] as students of the fictional Miss Godard's [[University-preparatory school|Preparatory School]] for Girls, and [[Lynn Redgrave]] as the school's [[headmaster|headmistress]]. The film takes place in 1963 and focuses on several students' plotting and sabotage of a proposed [[merger]] for the school to go [[coed]].\n\nOriginally titled ''The Hairy Bird'', the film's screenplay, set in 1963, is based loosely on Kernochan's experiences at [[Rosemary Hall (Greenwich, Connecticut)|Rosemary Hall]] around that time. Filming was done in [[Toronto]], Ontario, Canada at the [[Trafalgar Castle School]] in [[Whitby, Ontario|Whitby]]. The song \"The Hairy Bird\" plays during the film's end credits; it was written by Kernochan and sung by a group which includes Kernochan and five of her Rosemary Hall classmates, including [[Glenn Close]].<ref name=\"salon\">{{cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/entertainment/movies/int/2000/05/17/kernochan |work=[[Salon (website)|Salon]] |title=Girls' School Rules |date=May 17, 2000 |last= Grossman |first= Pam |access-date=August 10, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110806014609/http://www.salon.com/entertainment/movies/int/2000/05/17/kernochan |archive-date=August 6, 2011 }}</ref>\n\nThe film was given a limited release on September 4, 1998 in the United States under the title ''All I Wanna Do (''as its American distributor [[Miramax|Miramax Films]] found the original title too offensive), and was then acquired by [[Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment|Buena Vista Home Entertainment]] who released it [[Direct-to-video|straight-to-video]]. In Canada and the United Kingdom (as well as for later streaming distribution in the U.S.), it was released under the title '''''Strike!'''''.\n\n== Plot ==\nIn the fall of 1963 in [[New England]],  Odette \"Odie\" Sinclair is forcibly transferred by her parents to Miss Godard's Preparatory School for Girls after her parents find out that she has planned to have sex with her boyfriend, Dennis.  Upon arrival to the school, which is run by the stern but kind headmistress Miss McVane, Odette is introduced to her roommates, the intelligent and charismatic Verena von Stefan and the promiscuous Tinka Parker.  Verena and Tinka are the school's primary troublemakers; both mock an uptight [[hall monitor]] named Abigail \"Abby\" Sawyer, who has a penchant for tattletaling, and Verena regularly buys [[cigarettes]] from a lunch cook and is constantly late for classes.\n\nAfter a brief [[hazing]] period, Odie is welcomed into the D.A.R. (Daughters of the American Ravioli), a club of several girls at the school who have greater aspirations than those of their peers; the members congregate in the school's attic, where they have access to canned ravioli stored above the cafeteria.  The club is led by Verena, and consists of several other girls, including Theresa \"Tweety\" Goldberg, a [[bulimic]] who self-induces vomiting by drinking [[ipecac]] syrup and plans to be a child psychologist; and Maureen \"Momo\" Haines, a well-spoken science nerd and aspiring biologist.  Verena has plans to start a fashion magazine like ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'', while Tinka plans to be an \"actress-folk singer-slut\".  Odette declares her interest in politics, but pines to finish what she started with Dennis and lose her virginity.\n\nThe D.A.R. begins planning a rendezvous for Odie and Dennis, but when it is discovered that Miss Godard's is considering going [[co-ed]] with the nearby St. Ambrose boys' academy, the girls become divided on the matter and ultimately the club breaks up, leaving Verena and Momo to plan a sabotage for an upcoming dance with the St. Ambrose boys.  Meanwhile, the board of [[trustees]] for the school, which include Abby's parents, deliberates on the matter.  Miss McVane detests the [[merger]], but can do little about it because of the school's financial problems.\n\nAs the St. Ambrose dance arrives, Verena and Momo concoct a plan to cast the boys' academy in a bad light, by spiking the fruit punch with alcohol from the [[chemistry]] lab and feeding them Tweety's ipecac to induce vomiting during their choir performance; Verena then plants empty liquor bottles in their school bus.  The same night, Dennis arrives at the academy dressed in a St. Ambrose uniform and meets Odette for their rendezvous in the attic of the school.\n\nTweety and Tinka have a change of heart on the co-ed integration after Tweety is sexually assaulted and humiliated by some St. Ambrose students.  With the help of a group of teenage male townies called \"The Flat Critters\", led by Snake who has a crush on Tinka, they end up sending the intoxicated St. Ambrose boys home with a poor reputation.  Miss McVane recognizes Verena as the mastermind behind the sabotage.  Despite Miss McVane's appreciation for Verena's efforts, she is forced to expel Verena for having been caught fraternizing in her undergarments with a St. Ambrose boy.\n\nThe following week at the end of the year ceremony, the announcement of the merger is made by Mrs. Sawyer, much to the disapproval of the girls, including Abby.  The students, led by Odie, hole up inside the school dormitories and demand a student body vote count as a single vote on the board of trustees.  Meanwhile, a media circus surrounds the school, and the board of trustees agree to a student vote.  Ultimately, the votes against the integration outnumber those for it, and the students donate their personal savings to help with the school's debt.\n\nIn an epilogue prior to the credits, the girl's fate is revealed: \n:Verena goes on to publish ''Moi'', one of the most-read women's publications in the world; \n:Odette becomes a congresswoman and declares war on the [[tobacco industry]]; Momo is a scientist developing the first male oral [[contraceptive]]; \n:Tinka, a famous actress, [[coming out of the closet|comes out]] to [[Barbara Walters]] in a 1979 interview; \n:Tweety became a psychologist and wrote a best-seller about bulimia; \n:Abby, a radical [[political activist]], is serving a prison sentence for a 1970 bank holdup; \n:and Miss Godard's remains a girls school whose graduates include thousands of corporate and community leaders.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Kirsten Dunst]] as Verena von Stefan\n* [[Gaby Hoffmann]] as Odette Sinclair\n* [[Lynn Redgrave]] as Miss McVane\n* [[Rachael Leigh Cook]] as Abigail \"Abby\" Sawyer\n* [[Tom Guiry]] as Bradley \"Frosty\" Frost\n* [[Vincent Kartheiser]] as Snake (Flat Critter)\n* [[Monica Keena]] as Tinka Parker\n* [[Matthew Lawrence]] as Dennis\n* [[Heather Matarazzo]] as Theresa \"Tweety\" Goldberg\n* [[Merritt Wever]] as Maureen \"Momo\" Haines\n* Robert Bockstael as Mr. Frank Dewey\n* Brenda Devine as Miss Phipps\n* [[Rosemary Dunsmore]] as Page Sawyer\n* [[Nigel Bennett]] as Harvey Sawyer\n* Jenny Parsons as Mrs. Dewey\n* [[Dorothy Gordon (British actress)|Dorothy Gordon]] as Mrs. O'Boyle\n* [[Michael J.
