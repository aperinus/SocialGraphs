The film is a comedic take on the premise established in the 1953 television play ''[[Marty (teleplay)|Marty]]'' and the 1955 film ''[[Marty (film)|Marty]]'', while the title comes from the song \"[[Only the Lonely]]\" by [[Roy Orbison]]. The story follows a bachelor who is looking to settle down and start a family with a mortuary beautician, while coping with his overbearing mother who does not approve of her.\n\n==Plot==\nDanny Muldoon, a 38-year-old [[Chicago]] [[Chicago Police Department|policeman]], lives with his overbearing [[Irish American|Irish]] mother, Rose Muldoon. A lonely bachelor, he falls in love with Theresa Luna, an introverted girl who works in her father's [[funeral home]]. On their first date, they have a picnic on [[Comiskey Park]] field. Dating becomes difficult as Rose fears Theresa is trying to steal her son away.\n\nDanny's brother Patrick tries to convince him to remain unmarried and move to [[Florida]] with their mother to take care of her; Salvatore \"Sal\" Buonarte, one of Danny's married friends and a fellow officer, advises him not to settle down just yet, as he did. Danny begins to feel guilty about his relationship, especially towards his mother. This leads to his interrupting dates with Theresa to check on her.\n\nWhen Theresa finally meets Rose at a fancy dinner, Rose immediately begins to put her down, mocking her [[Sicilian American|Sicilian]] and [[Polish American|Polish]] heritage. Theresa stands up to her, then berates Danny for not doing so himself. After Theresa leaves, Danny scolds his mother for being so cruel, saying that her way of \"telling it like it is\" hurts people. He reminds her she lost a $450,000 account for his late father's company by making anti-Semitic remarks. He then tells Rose he will propose to Theresa, whether she approves or not.\n\nDanny apologizes to Theresa, proposing to her from the bucket of a [[Chicago Fire Department|Chicago fire truck]]. She says yes and they are set to be married. However, even though Rose finally approves, Danny calls to check on his mother in front of Theresa on the night before the wedding. Angered that they might never be alone, she walks off. Neither of them show up for the wedding. A few weeks later, Danny's friends ask why they called off the wedding, but he gives no answer. When a friend named Doyle suddenly passes away, alone with no wife or children, Danny realizes he doesn't want to end up that way.\n\nFinally, the day Danny and Rose are scheduled to move to Florida, Danny tells Rose that he can't let Theresa go because she's the best thing that ever happened to him. Reluctant at first, Rose finally goes to Florida without him, telling him to get married, have a family and be happy. Danny then goes to the funeral home, looking for Theresa.  However, her father tells him that she left for [[New York City]] by train. Danny contacts the railroad station manager, who stops the train at a station outside the city. There, Danny apologizes to Theresa and proclaims his love for her. He tells her that he will move to New York with her and join the [[New York City Police Department|NYPD]]. Having no more guilt about his mother, they board the train for New York to live the rest of their lives together.\n\nThroughout the film, the Muldoons' [[Greek people|Greek]] neighbor, Nick Acropolis \u2014 who has been encouraging Danny to pursue Theresa \u2014 attempts to woo Rose. She initially resists, but as she gradually softens her stance regarding Danny's relationship with Theresa, she ultimately warms to Nick, who takes Danny's place on the flight to Florida with her.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[John Candy]] as Officer Daniel \"Danny\" Muldoon, [[Chicago Police Department]]\n* [[Maureen O'Hara]] as Rose Muldoon\n* [[Ally Sheedy]] as Theresa Luna\n* [[Anthony Quinn]] as Nick Acropolis\n* [[James Belushi]] as Officer Salvatore \"Sal\" Buonarte, Chicago Police Department\n* [[Kevin Dunn]] as Patrick Muldoon\n* [[Macaulay Culkin]] as Billy Muldoon\n* [[Kieran Culkin]] as Patrick Muldoon, Jr.\n* [[Milo O'Shea]] as Doyle\n* [[Bert Remsen]] as Spats\n* Joe Greco as Joey Luna\n\n==Production==\n\n===Casting===\nChris Columbus wrote the part of Rose specifically for Maureen O'Hara, but did not know that she had retired from acting and was living in the [[Virgin Islands]]. Columbus contacted O'Hara's younger brother [[Charles B. Fitzsimons]], a producer and actor in the film industry, to ask him to send O'Hara a copy of the script, which he did, telling her, \"This you do!\". O'Hara read the script and loved it. She was reported to have replied to Fitzsimons, \"This I do!\". However, she would not commit until she met co-star [[John Candy]].\n\nCo-star Jim Belushi recounted this story: On the set of ''Only the Lonely'', the producers stuck Maureen O\u2019Hara in a tiny trailer. When John Candy complained on her behalf, he was told the budget was being spent on the picture, not on accommodations for old movie stars. Candy responded by giving O'Hara ''his'' trailer and going without one until the studio finally caved in and got a trailer for each actor.\n\n[[John Hughes (filmmaker)|John Hughes]] co-produced the film. This movie marked Macaulay Culkin's third film with Hughes and Candy (after ''[[Home Alone]]'' and ''[[Uncle Buck]]''). Other than ''[[New Port South]]'', it was the only film Hughes produced that he did not write.\n\n===Filming===\nMost of the film was shot on location in [[Chicago]]. Danny and Rose Muldoon's house is located at the intersection of [[Clark Street (Chicago)|Clark Street]] and Roscoe Street, as is the front fa\u00e7ade of O'Neils' Pub. The inside of the pub was shot at Emmett's Pub, a Chicago landmark that was also used in ''[[Uncle Buck]]'', another film with John Candy. At the request of producer John Hughes (a Chicagoan and big fan of the [[Chicago White Sox]]) and sports fan John Candy, the baseball stadium where Danny and Theresa's first date took place was arranged to be set at old [[Comiskey Park]] (home of the [[Chicago White Sox]] until 1990). Hughes hastily arranged the filming, as the stadium was slated to be torn down imminently. There is also a shot showing old Comiskey Park and the new [[Guaranteed Rate Field]], the current home of the White Sox, under construction next door. Comiskey Park was located at the corner of 35th St. and Shields Ave., on the South Side of Chicago. The scene where Danny and Theresa kiss along [[Lake Michigan]] is located at [[Lincoln Park, Chicago]], and the dinner scene was shot at One Ambassador East, also known as the Ambassador East Hotel, located at 1301 North State Parkway in Chicago's [[Gold Coast (Chicago)|Gold Coast]]. The church scenes were filmed at [[St. John Cantius Church (Chicago)|St. John Cantius Church]] in [[West Town, Chicago|West Town]] on 825 N Carpenter St.\n\nThe final scene with Danny and Theresa was shot at the [[Niles (Amtrak station)|Amtrak station]] in [[Niles, Michigan]], which was renamed to Willoughby and decorated with Christmas lights for the filming.<ref name=\"amtrak\">{{cite web |url=http://www.greatamericanstations.com/Stations/NLS |title=Niles, Michigan (NLS) |publisher=Amtrak |access-date=October 25, 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Music===\nRoy Orbison's song \"Only the Lonely\" is played in its entirety in the movie's opening scene. \"[[Someone Like You (Van Morrison song)|Someone Like You]]\" by [[Van Morrison]] is played during one of Danny and Theresa's dates. \"Dreams to Remember\" by [[Etta James]] is played, also in its entirety. Also, \"[[Pachelbel's Canon]]\" is played briefly during the wedding scene. The film's original music was composed and conducted by [[Maurice Jarre]].\n\nThe soundtrack album was released by [[Var\u00e8se Sarabande]], featuring 28 minutes of Jarre's score and the songs \"Only the Lonely\" and \"Someone Like You.\"\n\n==Reception==\nOn [[Rotten Tomatoes]] the film has an approval rating of 64% based on reviews from 22 critics.<ref name=\"tomatoes\">{{cite web |title=Only the Lonely (1991) |url= https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/only_the_lonely/ |website= [[Rotten Tomatoes]] }}</ref>\n\n[[Entertainment Weekly]] gave it a grade C.<ref>{{cite web |title=Only the Lonely |url=https://ew.com/article/1991/05/31/only-lonely-2/ |website=EW.com }}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{wikiquote}}\n* {{IMDb title|id=0102598|title=Only the Lonely}}\n* {{tcmdb title|22217|Only the Lonely}}\n* {{AllRovi movie|id=36496|title=Only the Lonely}}\n* {{Rotten Tomatoes|id=only_the_lonely|title=Only the Lonely}}\n* {{Mojo title|onlythelonely|Only the Lonely}}\n\n{{Chris Columbus}}\n{{John Hughes}}\n{{Roy Orbison}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Only The Lonely (film)}}\n[[Category:1990s romantic comedy-drama films]]\n[[Category:1991 films]]\n[[Category:20th Century Fox films]]\n[[Category:American romantic comedy-drama films]]\n[[Category:1990s English-language films]]\n[[Category:Fictional portrayals of the Chicago Police Department]]\n[[Category:Films based on songs]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Maurice Jarre]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Chris Columbus]]\n[[Category:Films produced by John Hughes (filmmaker)]]\n[[Category:Films set in Chicago]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Chicago]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Michigan]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by Chris Columbus]]\n[[Category:Roy Orbison]]\n[[Category:1991 comedy films]]\n[[Category:1991 drama films]]\n[[Category:1990s American films]]"}]}}}}
