Teenage Seita and his young sister Setsuko escape unharmed, but their mother dies in the hospital. Seita conceals their mother's death from Setsuko in an attempt to keep her happy, which she later learns of despite Seita's efforts. Seita and Setsuko move in with a distant aunt, and Seita retrieves supplies he buried before the bombing and gives everything to his aunt, save for a tin of [[Sakuma drops]]. The aunt convinces Seita to sell his mother's silk [[kimono]] for rice as rations shrink and the number of refugees in the house grows. Seita uses some of his mother's money in the bank to buy supplies, but eventually, the aunt becomes resentful of the children, deeming them unworthy of earning her food.\n\nSeita and Setsuko decide to leave their aunt's home after excessive insults, and they move into an abandoned bomb shelter. They release [[Firefly|fireflies]] into the shelter for light. The next day, Setsuko is horrified to find that the insects have died. She buries them in a grave, asking why they and her mother had to die. As they run out of rice, Seita steals from farmers and loots homes during air raids, for which he is beaten and sent to the police. The officer realizes Seita is stealing due to hunger and releases him. When Setsuko falls ill, a doctor explains that she is suffering from [[malnutrition]]. Desperate, Seita withdraws the last of the money in their mother's bank account. After doing so, he becomes distraught when he learns that [[Surrender of Japan|Japan has surrendered]], and that his father, an [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] captain, is most likely dead, as most of Japan's navy has been sunk. Seita returns to Setsuko with food, but finds her dying. She later dies as Seita finishes preparing the food. Seita cremates Setsuko's body and her stuffed doll in a straw casket. He carries her ashes in the candy tin along with his father's photograph.\n\nShortly after the end of [[World War II]], Seita dies of [[starvation]] at a [[Sannomiya]] train station surrounded by other malnourished people, as shown ''[[in medias res]]''. A janitor is tasked with removing the bodies before the arrival of the Americans. The janitor sorts through Seita's possessions and finds the candy tin, which he throws into a field. Setsuko's ashes spread out, and her spirit springs from the tin and is joined by Seita's spirit and a cloud of fireflies. They board a ghostly train and, throughout the journey, look back at the events leading to Seita's death. Their spirits later arrive at their destination, healthy and happy. Surrounded by fireflies, they rest on a hilltop bench overlooking present-day Kobe.\n\n==Cast==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\"|Character\n! rowspan=\"2\"|Japanese voice actor\n! colspan=\"2\"|English voice actor\n|-\n! <small>Skypilot Entertainment/[[Central Park Media|CPM]] (1998)</small>\n! <small>[[Toho]]/[[Seraphim Digital|Seraphim]]/[[Sentai Filmworks|Sentai]] (2012)</small>\n|-\n!{{nihongo|Seita Yokokawa|\u6a2a\u5ddd \u6e05\u592a}}\n|{{ill|Tsutomu Tatsumi|ja|\u8fb0\u5df3\u52aa}}\n|[[J.

Nosaka expressed surprise when an animated version was offered.<ref name=\"Animerica8\"/> After seeing the storyboards, Nosaka concluded that it was not possible for such a story to have been made in any method other than animation and expressed surprise in how accurately the rice paddies and townscape were depicted.<ref name=\"Animerica8\"/>\n\n[[Isao Takahata]] said that he was compelled to film the short story after seeing how the main character, Seita, \"was a unique wartime ninth grader\".<ref name=\"Animerica7\">{{cite journal |title=The Animerica Interview: Takahata and Nosaka: Two Grave Voices in Animation |journal=[[Animerica]] |volume=2 |issue=11 |page=7 |url=http://ghiblicon.blogspot.com/2011/04/animerica-interviews-isao-takahata-and.html |year=1994  |access-date=4 July 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180704093747/http://ghiblicon.blogspot.com/2011/04/animerica-interviews-isao-takahata-and.html |archive-date=4 July 2018 |url-status=live}}</ref> Takahata explained that any wartime story, whether animated or not animated, \"tends to be moving and tear-jerking\", and that young people develop an \"[[inferiority complex]]\" where they perceive people in wartime eras as being more noble and more able than they are, and therefore the audience believes that the story has nothing to do with them. Takahata argued that he wanted to dispel this mindset.<ref name=\"Animerica8\"/> When Nosaka asked if the film characters were \"having fun\", Takahata answered that he clearly depicted Seita and Setsuko had \"substantial\" days and that they were \"''enjoying'' their days\".<ref name=\"Animerica10\">{{cite journal |title=The Animerica Interview: Takahata and Nosaka: Two Grave Voices in Animation |journal=[[Animerica]] |volume=2 |issue=11 |pages=10 |url=http://ghiblicon.blogspot.com/2011/04/animerica-interviews-isao-takahata-and.html |year=1994  |access-date=4 July 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180704093747/http://ghiblicon.blogspot.com/2011/04/animerica-interviews-isao-takahata-and.html |archive-date=4 July 2018 |url-status=live}}</ref> Takahata said that Setsuko was even more difficult to animate than Seita, and that he had never before depicted a girl younger than five.<ref name=\"Animerica8\"/> Takahata said that \"In that respect, when you make the book into a movie, Setsuko becomes a tangible person\", and that four-year-olds often become more assertive and self-centered, and try to get their own ways during that age. He explained that while one could \"have a scene where Seita can't stand that anymore\", it is \"difficult to incorporate into a story\".<ref name=\"Animerica9\"/> Takahata explained that the film is from Seita's point of view, \"and even objective passages are filtered through his feelings\".<ref name=\"Animerica10\"/>\n\nTakahata said that he had considered using non-traditional animation methods, but because \"the schedule was planned and the movie's release date set, and the staff assembled, it was apparent there was no room for such a trial-and-error approach\".<ref name=\"Animerica10\"/> He further remarked that he had difficulty animating the scenery since, in Japanese animation, one is \"not allowed\" to depict Japan in a realistic manner.<ref name=\"Animerica8\"/> Animators often traveled to foreign countries to do research on how to depict them, but such research had not been done before for a Japanese setting.<ref name=\"Animerica8\"/> While animating the movie, Takahata also created several different cuts of the scene in which Seita cremates Setsuko's body. Takahata spent a lot of time on this scene, trying to create the perfect iteration of it. Each of these cuts remained unfinished and unused in the end.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Interview: Studio Ghibli Production Coordinator Hirokatsu Kihara |url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/interview/2018-08-21/studio-ghibli-production-coordinator-hirokatsu-kihara/.135726 |access-date=2022-03-02 |website=Anime News Network |language=en}}</ref>\n\nMost of the illustration outlines in the film are in brown, instead of the customary black. Black outlines were only used when it was absolutely necessary. Color coordinator [[Michiyo Yasuda]] said this was done to give the film a softer feel. Yasuda said that this technique had never been used in an anime before ''Grave of the Fireflies'', \"and it was done on a challenge\".<ref name=\"Animerica8\"/> Yasuda explained that brown is more difficult to use than black because it does not contrast as well as black.<ref name=\"Animerica8\"/>\n\n===Music===\nThe [[film score]] was composed by [[Michio Mamiya]].

The film focuses its attention almost entirely on the personal tragedies that war gives rise to, rather than seeking to glamorize it as a heroic struggle between competing nations. It emphasizes that war is society's failure to perform its most important duty: to protect its own people.<ref>{{cite web|title=Grave of the Fireflies (Hotaru no haka)|last=Etherington |first=Daniel|url=http://www.film4.com/reviews/1988/grave-of-the-fireflies|work=[[Film4]]|publisher=[[Channel Four Television Corporation]]|access-date=23 November 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130322000916/http://www.film4.com/reviews/1988/grave-of-the-fireflies|archive-date=22 March 2013}}</ref>\n\nHowever, Takahata repeatedly denied that the film was an anti-war film. In his own words, it \"is not at all an anti-war anime and contains absolutely no such message\". Instead, Takahata had intended to convey an image of the brother and sister living a failed life due to isolation from society and invoke sympathy particularly in people in their teens and twenties.<ref name = Interview>Interview published on May 1988 edition of ''[[Animage]]''</ref><ref name = Things>{{cite book|year=1991|script-title=ja:\u6620\u753b\u3092\u4f5c\u308a\u306a\u304c\u3089\u8003\u3048\u305f\u3053\u3068|trans-title=Things I Thought While Making Movies|language=ja|first=Isao|last=Takahata|author-link=Isao Takahata|publisher=[[Tokuma Shoten]]|page=471|isbn=9784195546390}}</ref>\n\nSince the film gives little context to the war, Takahata feared a politician could just as easily claim fighting is needed to avoid such tragedies. In general, he was skeptical that depictions of suffering in similar works, such as ''[[Barefoot Gen]]'', actually prevent aggression. The director was nevertheless an anti-war advocate, a staunch supporter of [[Article 9 of the Japanese Constitution]], and has openly criticized Japan's penchant for conformity, allowing them to be rallied against other nations.

This film was called ''Border 1939'', based on the novel ''The Border'' by Shin Shikata, and would have told the story of a Japanese teenager from colonial Seoul joining an anti-Japanese resistance group in Mongolia. The film was intended as an indictment of Japanese imperialist sentiment, which is briefly touched upon in ''Grave of the Fireflies''. Although Takahata finished a full outline (which is republished in his book ''Thoughts While Making Movies''), the film was canceled before production could start due to the [[1989 Tiananmen Square protests]].

The drama aired on 1 November 2005. Like the anime, the live-action version of ''Grave of the Fireflies'' focuses on two siblings struggling to survive the final months of the war in [[Kobe, Japan]]. Unlike the animated version, it tells the story from the point of view of their cousin (the aunt's daughter) and deals with the issue of how the war-time environment could change a kind lady into a hard-hearted woman. It stars [[Nanako Matsushima]] as the aunt, as well as [[Mao Inoue]] as their cousin.\n\n===2008 live-action version===\nA different live-action version was released in Japan on 5 July 2008, {{ill|Reo Yoshitake|ja|\u5409\u6b66\u601c\u6717}} as Seita, {{ill|Rina Hatakeyama|ja|\u7560\u5c71\u3042\u3084\u306a}} as Setsuko, [[Keiko Matsuzaka]] as the aunt, and [[Seiko Matsuda]] as the children's mother.
