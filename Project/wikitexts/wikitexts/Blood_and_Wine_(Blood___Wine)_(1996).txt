The screenplay was written by Nick Villiers and Alison Cross. Rafelson has stated that the film forms the final part of his unofficial trilogy with Nicholson, with whom he made ''[[Five Easy Pieces]]'' and ''[[The King of Marvin Gardens]]'' in the 1970s.<ref>{{cite web |title=Jack Nicholson is His Seedy Best in Blood & Wine |first=Gary |last=Johnson |url=http://www.imagesjournal.com/issue02/reviews/bloodandwine.htm |publisher=Images Journal |access-date=August 10, 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nAlex Gates ([[Jack Nicholson]]) is a [[Miami]] wine merchant who has distanced himself from his alcoholic wife Suzanne ([[Judy Davis]]) with his philandering, and from his stepson Jason ([[Stephen Dorff]]) with his indifference.\n\nHeavily in debt, Alex hatches a plan to steal a valuable diamond necklace from the house of his clients, the Reese family, where his Cuban mistress Gabriela ([[Jennifer Lopez]]) works. He cases the house during a wine delivery with Jason, who works in Alex's business. Jason becomes attracted to Gabriela, unaware of her relationship with his father.\n\nOn the day of the heist, Alex and his partner Victor ([[Michael Caine]]), a British [[safe-cracking|safe-cracker]], arrive at the house under the pretense that the Reeses' wine cellar needs repairs. Gabriela was supposed to let them in, but she was fired the day before. Fortunately, Alex had cultivated a relationship with the security guard and is able to convince him to let them inside. Victor sends Alex and the guard off on an errand while he works on the safe, but a second guard becomes suspicious, although Victor is able to complete the job before being discovered.\n\nThe pair decide that Alex will [[pawnshop|pawn]] the necklace in [[New York City]], and he invites Gabriela to go with him. As he is packing, Suzanne happens upon his airline tickets and immediately realizes he is having another affair. The two get into a physical altercation and Suzanne knocks him out with a fire poker. Panicking, Suzanne empties out his suitcase, where he has hidden the necklace, and uses it for her own clothing. She and Jason flee to the [[Florida Keys]]. Upon arriving, they discover the necklace, but Suzanne doesn't want to keep it. Jason has it appraised and discovers it is worth $1 million. He also visits Gabriela back in Miami, giving her the phone number of the place where they are staying.\n\nVictor and Alex visit Jason's friend Henry ([[Harold Perrineau]]) in an attempt to learn Jason's whereabouts. Victor, who is dying of tuberculosis and determined to profit from the heist, assaults Henry before Alex realizes he doesn't know anything. The pair contact various jewelers to be on the lookout for the necklace and get a report from Jason's appraiser. Arriving in [[Key Largo]], Victor pretends to flirt with Suzanne, but Jason, who has gotten a description of Henry's assailant, realizes who he is. After a fight, Jason flees with his mother in their car. Victor and Alex give chase and cause an accident that kills Suzanne. Although injured, Jason discharges himself from the hospital and returns to Miami to kill his stepfather, only to find Gabriela in Alex's bed. After a brief argument, the two reconcile.\n\nAlex discovers Jason and Gabriela the next morning, and accuses her of sleeping with his son. Victor confronts Jason, who tricks him into thinking that he has returned the necklace to Alex. Victor goes to Alex's house and attacks him before collapsing from exhaustion, whereupon Alex smothers Victor with a pillow. That night, Jason shows the necklace to Gabriela. The next day, she calls Alex and they search Jason's boat, but Jason, anticipating this, confronts them and he and Alex fight.\n\nEventually, Jason crushes Alex between the boat and the dock, severely injuring him, before fleeing the scene. Gabriela, who had fled with the necklace, returns and leaves it with Alex, insisting that she doesn't want it, but pilfers one of the diamonds before she leaves. With an ambulance and the police on the way, a defeated Alex realizes he has no choice but to dispose of the necklace and throws it into the ocean.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Jack Nicholson]] as Alex Gates\n* [[Stephen Dorff]] as Jason\n* [[Jennifer Lopez]] as Gabriela\n* [[Judy Davis]] as Suzanne Gates\n* [[Michael Caine]] as Victor Spansky\n* [[Harold Perrineau Jr.]] as Henry\n* Robyn Peterson as Dina Reese\n* [[Mike Starr (actor)|Mike Starr]] as Mike\n* John Seitz as Frank Reese\n* [[Marc Macaulay]] as Guard\n* Dan Daily as Todd\n* Marta Velasco as Gabriela's Cousin\n\n==Production==\nBritish producer [[Jeremy Thomas]] was attracted to work with Rafelson due to what he perceived as the director's European sensibilities. He later remembered:\n\n{{blockquote|It was a different experience for me, because growing up as an independent producer it was difficult to interact with a corporate system. But then I got this screenplay which had Jack Nicholson attached to it and Bob Rafelson, who I knew quite well, and so I thought, I had never gone near a genre-type of film and so maybe I will try some noir-ish sort of film, set in Miami, which is the flavour of Hollywood, and see if we can do it. It was certainly an incredible cast, and I sold the film to 20th Century Fox, and I had a moment of flirtation with a studio movie type of film. I am very fond of the film.<ref name=berlinale>{{cite web |title=At the Cutting Edge \u2013 Producer Jeremy Thomas, interviewed by producer Sandy Lieberson |first=Jeremy |last=Thomas |author2=Lieberson, Sanford |date=2006-04-11 |url=http://www.berlinale-talentcampus.de/story/89/1789.html |publisher=[[Berlinale Talent Campus]] |access-date=August 10, 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100524091710/http://www.berlinale-talentcampus.de/story/89/1789.html |archive-date=May 24, 2010 }}</ref>}}\n\n''Blood and Wine'' was shot in Miami, [[South Florida]] and the [[Florida Keys]], including some scenes at the Caribbean Club in [[Key Largo]].<ref>Miami Bar Guide: Caribbean Club web site.
