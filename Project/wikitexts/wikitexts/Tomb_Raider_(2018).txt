An American and British co-production, it is based on the [[Tomb Raider (2013 video game)|2013 video game of the same name]], with some elements of [[Rise of the Tomb Raider|its sequel]] by [[Crystal Dynamics]], a [[Reboot (fiction)|reboot]], and the third installment in the ''[[List of Tomb Raider media|Tomb Raider]]'' film series. The film stars [[Alicia Vikander]] as [[Lara Croft]], who embarks on a perilous journey to her father's last-known destination, hoping to solve the mystery of his disappearance. [[Dominic West]], [[Walton Goggins]], [[Daniel Wu]], and [[Kristin Scott Thomas]] appear in supporting roles.\n\n[[Principal photography]] lasted from January to June 2017 and took place at [[Warner Bros. Studios, Leavesden]] in [[Hertfordshire]], England, and [[Cape Town]], South Africa. The film was also shot on location across [[London]], particularly [[East London]]. The first ''Tomb Raider'' film not to be distributed by [[Paramount Pictures]], it was released in the United Kingdom on March 14, 2018, and in the United States on March 16, 2018, by [[Warner Bros.

She is arrested after a collision with a police car. Richard's business partner Ana Miller posts her bail and urges Lara to accept her inheritance. Lara believes her father to still be alive, but Miller warns Lara that if she does not claim her inheritance, the family estate, Croft Manor, will be sold off. Lara reluctantly accepts and gains access to a secret chamber in her father's tomb, where she finds a pre-recorded video message from Richard detailing his research into [[Himiko]], the mythical Queen of [[Yamatai]] who was said to command the power over life and death. Richard warns Lara to destroy his research, but she ignores his warnings and investigates further.\n\nNot yet having received her inheritance Lara is forced to pawn the jade pendant her father gave her. With the money Lara travels to [[Hong Kong]] where she hires Lu Ren, captain of the ship ''Endurance'', to sail into the [[Devil's Sea]] and the island of Yamatai. The ship capsizes in a violent storm and Lara has washed ashore where she is knocked unconscious. She awakens only to encounter Mathias Vogel, the leader of an expedition to locate Himiko's tomb. The expedition has been funded by a shadowy organization called Trinity, which seeks to harness and weaponize Himiko's power. Mathias takes Lara prisoner, claiming that he killed her father and revealing that he intends to use Richard's research to continue his expedition. He adds Lara and Lu to his slave force. The two of them try to escape, but only Lara succeeds.\n\nAfter surviving rapids and narrowly avoiding falling over a waterfall with the wreck of a wartime airplane, Lara is forced to kill a Trinity guard after nightfall. She follows a mysterious figure through the jungle and discovers that the figure is her father, who stayed on the island to prevent Trinity from finding Himiko's tomb. After Lara convinces him that she is real and not a figment of his imagination, Richard treats her injuries. Despite his protests, Lara sets off the next morning to steal Mathias' satellite phone. Lara makes contact with Lu, and he, along with the other slaves, stage a distraction that allows Lara to infiltrate the Trinity camp and take the phone. In the ensuing chaos, Lu grabs an assault rifle, provides cover for the escapees, and guns down several Trinity soldiers, while Richard makes his way to Himiko's tomb but is captured by Mathias, who persuades Lara to open the tomb, something she has prepared for since she was a child. At that point, the entrance to the tomb self-destructs and falls away, allowing them to enter the tomb which has not been seen for over two thousand years.\n\nThe party navigates a series of booby traps and locates Himiko's [[sarcophagus]]. When a Trinity soldier attempts to remove her corpse, he is infected by a highly infectious pathogen that reduces him to an aggressive, [[necrosis|necrotic]] zombie. Lara realizes that Himiko was an asymptomatic carrier of the virus, who chose to entomb herself so that she could not infect others. Mathias concludes that Trinity wants to create a bio-weapon out of her body but he cannot remove Himiko's body and instead settles for cutting off a finger, which he seals in a pouch. In the confusion, Lara and Richard overpower the remaining soldiers, although Mathias escapes and Richard becomes infected. Knowing there is no cure, Richard proposes destroying Himiko's tomb to prevent the disease from spreading across the world. Lara pursues Mathias as Richard sets off a bomb, killing himself and sealing the tomb. Lara confronts and kills Mathias by kicking him off a ledge after a fight. She barely escapes the tomb as it collapses, regrouping with Lu and the slaves; they commandeer a Trinity helicopter to escape Yamatai.\n\nLara returns to London, where she formally accepts her inheritance and inadvertently discovers that Trinity's [[front company]], Patna, is a [[subsidiary]] of Croft Holdings. She investigates further and suspects Ana is an agent of Trinity and manipulated her into accepting her inheritance to take control of Croft Holdings' business operations when Richard stopped cooperating with Trinity. Having witnessed Trinity's ruthlessness firsthand, she prepares for her next adventure. [[Mid-credits scene|Later]], Lara returns to Alan's pawnshop to buy back her pendant and also purchases [[Heckler & Koch USP|two identical guns]].\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Alicia Vikander]] as 21-year-old [[Lara Croft]]\n** Maisy De Freitas as 7-year-old Lara\n** [[Emily Carey]] as 14-year-old Lara\n* [[Dominic West]] as Lord Richard Croft, Lara's archaeologist father.\n* [[Walton Goggins]] as Mathias Vogel, a rival archaeologist of Richard Croft, and a member of Trinity, a shadowy organization.\n* [[Daniel Wu]] is Lu Ren, the ship captain who helps Lara to search for her father.\n* [[Kristin Scott Thomas]] as Ana Miller, an associate at Richard Croft's company, Croft Holdings.\n* [[Derek Jacobi]] as Mr. Yaffe, an associate at Croft Holdings.\n* [[Hannah John-Kamen]] as Sophie, Lara's friend\n* [[Nick Frost]] as Alan, a pawn shop owner.\n* [[Jaime Winstone]] as Pamela, Alan's wife\n\nAdditionally, [[Antonio Aakeel]] plays Lara's friend Nitin.
