Macy]], [[Laura Dern]], [[David Paymer]] and [[Meat Loaf]] based on a [[Focus (novel)|1945 novel]] by playwright [[Arthur Miller]]. The film premiered at the [[2001 Toronto International Film Festival|Toronto International Film Festival]] and was given a [[Limited theatrical release|limited release]] on October 19, 2001.<ref name=\"AllMovie\">{{cite web |title=Focus (2001) |url=https://www.allmovie.com/movie/focus-v255714 |website=[[AllMovie]] |access-date=5 November 2022}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nIn the waning months of [[World War II]], Lawrence Newman is a mild-mannered, [[gentile]] man who works as a personnel manager and lives with his mother in [[Brooklyn]]. His next-door neighbor, Fred, is friendly to him but is also a member of an [[Antisemitism|anti-Semitic]] group called the Union Crusaders, who blame Jews for the war. Neighborhood tensions have also intensified with the arrival of a Jewish storekeeper named Finkelstein. One day, a gentile woman named Gertrude Hart shows up at Lawrence\u2019s workplace to apply for a job, but Lawrence brushes her off on his suspicion that she\u2019s Jewish and his fear of being fired.\n\nLawrence buys a new pair of eyeglasses that people around him say makes him \"[[Stereotypes of Jews#Stereotype by type|look Jewish]]\" when he wears them. As he continues to wear the eyeglasses, he himself becomes the target of anti-Semitic sentiment. His boss demotes him with no explanation, and Lawrence resigns in protest. He has no luck in finding a new job until he runs into Gertrude, who has found secretarial work in a Jewish-owned business. After he apologizes to her for his behavior, she helps him find work at the company. The two befriend each other and eventually marry.\n\nAs a couple, Gertrude and Lawrence become subject to multiple social humiliations, including a rejection from a resort where they had made reservations for a weekend trip. The attitude of their neighbors towards them also becomes frostier. Gertrude, who knows more than her husband about the Union Crusaders, urges him to attend a rally for his own protection. Soon, Lawrence finds himself in a situation where he must contend with the neighborhood\u2019s prejudice, as well as his own. \n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[William H.

Slavin commissioned playwright [[Kendrew Lascelles]] to write the script, and after some revisions and suggestions by Miller, the adaptation was approved.<ref name=\":0\" /> One of the changes which Slavin made was his decision to root the film \"on the outer edges of [[surrealism]] and [[film noir]].\"<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nFor the part of Lawrence, Slavin specifically sought out William H. Macy, basing his choice on the belief that the story is a [[fable]] about how \"people\u2019s perceptions and...intolerance blinds [one] to seeing the [actual] person.\"<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web |last=Lumenick |first=Lou |first4=Get author RSS |date=2001-10-21 |title=It's Macy's Day: Actor on Fear, Success in Hollywood |url=https://nypost.com/2001/10/21/its-macys-day-actor-on-fear-success-in-hollywood/ |access-date=2022-11-05 |website=New York Post |language=en-US}}</ref><ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web |date=October 9, 2001 |title=William H.

Said Slavin, \"One of my goals was to build a '''[[Mary Poppins (film)|Mary Poppins]]''<nowiki/>'-like world, stylizing the setting so that everything looked perfect, so that you felt rather than saw the dark underbelly. You're taken in by the prettiness, but you don't trust it.\"<ref name=\":0\" /> Editor [[Tariq Anwar (film editor)|Tariq Anwar]], who had worked on the film ''[[American Beauty (1999 film)|American Beauty]]'', was chosen by Slavin to achieve this vision.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe film was personally financed by [[Michael Bloomberg]], a friend of Slavin's who was a candidate for mayor of New York City at the time. Slavin said, \"Michael read it in one day, called me and said, 'Let's do it.' This movie happened because of him. And it wasn't like he just put the money down and walked away.
