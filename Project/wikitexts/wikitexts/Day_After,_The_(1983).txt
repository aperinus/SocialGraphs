They include the Dahlberg family, which lives on its farm in [[Harrisonville, Missouri]], {{convert|40|mi|km}} from Kansas City. The Dahlbergs' eldest daughter, Denise ([[Lori Lethin]]), is set to be married in two days to a student at the [[University of Kansas]], and near the start of the film, they perform their wedding dress rehearsal. Dr. Russell Oakes ([[Jason Robards]]) is a doctor in Kansas City who also teaches classes at the [[University of Kansas]] in [[Lawrence, Kansas]]. Stephen Klein ([[Steve Guttenberg]]) is a University of Kansas pre-med student. Airman First Class Billy McCoy ([[William Allen Young]]) lives at [[Whiteman Air Force Base]] near [[Sedalia, Missouri]] with his wife and daughter and mans a [[Minuteman (missile)|Minuteman]] launch site in Sweetsage, Missouri, {{convert|20|mi|km}} from Kansas City. Another family, the Hendrys, lives on a farm adjoining McCoy's launch site.\n\nThe film's first portion focuses on the characters' everyday lives as they react to news reports of a rapidly-escalating conflict between the [[Soviet Union]] and the [[United States]]. The latter portion of the film shows their experience dealing with the aftermath of the war. At the start of the film, reports depict the Soviet Union and [[Warsaw Pact]] forces building on the border between [[East Germany]] and [[West Germany]] demanding [[NATO]] to withdraw from [[West Berlin]]. [[West Berlin]] is blockaded, and a NATO attempt to break the blockade via the [[Helmstedt-Marienborn]] border results in heavy casualties. The next day, the military conflict in [[Europe]] rapidly escalates, with Soviet and Warsaw Pact forces launching a full-scale invasion of West Germany. When Soviet forces reach the [[Rhine]], NATO uses [[tactical nuclear weapons]] to prevent a possible invasion of [[France]]. Soon, each side attacks naval targets in the [[Persian Gulf]]. A Soviet nuclear attack also destroys [[NATO headquarters]] in [[Brussels]]. Most characters have begun to prepare for potential [[Nuclear warfare|nuclear war]], with Stephen Klein hitching a ride home to [[Joplin, Missouri]].\n\nAs the threat of large-scale nuclear attack grows, [[hoarding]] begins and so does evacuation of major cities in both the Soviet Union and the United States. Frequent [[Emergency Broadcast System]] warnings are sent over television and radio, and Kansas City begins to empty, which clogs outbound freeways. Dr. Oakes is among the many stuck in the traffic jam as he drives toward Lawrence, but after hearing an EBS alert and realizing the danger to Kansas City and his family living there, he decides to turn around and to head home.\n\nSoviet strikes destroy missile detection centers at [[Beale Air Force Base]] and [[RAF Fylingdales]]. Minutes apart, the United States launches its Minuteman missiles, and its military personnel aboard the [[EC-135 Looking Glass]] aircraft track inbound Soviet nuclear missiles. The film deliberately leaves unclear who fired first. McCoy flees the site at which he is stationed since its Minuteman missile has been launched, and he intends to locate his wife and daughter. As air raid sirens go off, widespread panic grips Kansas City, as most people frantically seek fallout shelters and other protection from the imminent Soviet nuclear attack.\n[[File:Dayafter1.jpg|thumb|A scene from the film, in which a nuclear weapon detonates near [[DeSoto, Kansas]].]]\n\nA [[high-altitude nuclear explosion]] occurs over the [[Central United States]] and generates an [[Nuclear electromagnetic pulse|electromagnetic pulse]] that disables vehicles and destroys the electrical grid. Shortly afterward, high-yield nuclear weapons detonate over numerous locations, including downtown Kansas City, Sedalia, and Sweetsage. Having initially ignored the crisis, the Hendry family is killed when it tries to flee. McCoy takes refuge in a truck trailer, and Klein, who had hitchhiked as far as Harrisonville, finds the Dahlberg home and begs for protection in the family's basement. In the meantime, the young Danny Dahlberg is flash blinded when he looks at a nearby nuclear detonation. Dr. Oakes, who witnessed the explosion over Kansas City, walks to the hospital in Lawrence and begins treating patients.\n\nNuclear fallout and its deadly effects are felt everywhere in the region. McCoy and Oakes, both of whom were outside immediately after the explosions, have been unknowingly exposed to lethal doses of radiation. Denise Dahlberg is frantic after days in the family's basement shelter and runs outside, and Klein, who vows to her father that he will bring her back, keeps his promise, but they have been exposed to very high doses of radiation. McCoy learns in his travels that Sedalia and environs have been obliterated and so his wife and daughter are dead. Food and water are in very short supply, and looting and other criminal activity lead to the imposition of martial law. Klein takes Denise and Danny to the hospital in Lawrence for treatment. McCoy also travels there, where he dies of [[acute radiation syndrome|radiation poisoning]]. Denise, Danny, and Klein finally leave for the Dahlberg farm when it becomes clear that they cannot be treated medically for their injuries. It is implied that Denise and Klein's conditions are terminal and that they will soon die. The [[President of the United States|President]] addresses the nation via radio and announces that a ceasefire has been reached with the Soviet Union, which sustained similar devastating attacks, and that relief efforts are underway, but few of those listening seem to care.\n\nJim Dahlberg, returning home from a municipal meeting about agricultural techniques that may work to grow food in the new circumstances, finds [[squatters]] on the farm. He explains that it is his land and asks them to leave, but one of the squatters shoots and kills him without any sign of remorse. At last aware that he has sustained lethal exposure to radiation, Oakes returns to Kansas City on foot to see the site of his home before he dies. He finds squatters there and attempts to drive them off, but he is instead offered food. Oakes collapses and weeps, and one of the squatters comforts him.\n\nThe film ends as the Lawrence science faculty head, Joe Huxley, repeatedly tries to contact other survivors with shortwave radio, only to find no response.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{col-begin}}{{col-break}}\n; '''The Oakeses'''\n* [[Jason Robards]] as Dr. Russell Oakes\n* [[Georgann Johnson]] as Helen Oakes\n* Kyle Aletter as Marilyn Oakes\n\n; '''The Dahlbergs'''\n* [[John Cullum]] as Jim Dahlberg\n* [[Bibi Besch]] as Eve Dahlberg\n* [[Lori Lethin]] as Denise Dahlberg\n* Doug Scott as Danny Dahlberg\n* Ellen Anthony as Joleen Dahlberg\n\n; '''Hospital staff'''\n* [[JoBeth Williams]] as Nurse Nancy Bauer\n* [[Calvin Jung]] as Dr. Sam Hachiya\n* [[Lin McCarthy]] as Dr. Austin\n* [[Rosanna Huffman]] as Dr. Wallenberg\n* [[George Petrie (actor)|George Petrie]] as Dr. Landowska\n* Jonathan Estrin as Julian French\n* [[Wayne Knight]] as Man in Hospital\n{{col-break}}\n; '''Others'''\n* [[Steve Guttenberg]] as Stephen Klein\n* [[John Lithgow]] as Joe Huxley\n* [[Amy Madigan]] as Alison Ransom\n* [[William Allen Young]] as Airman First Class Billy McCoy\n* [[Jeff East]] as Bruce Gallatin\n* [[Dennis Lipscomb]] as Reverend Walker\n* Clayton Day as Dennis Hendry\n* Antonie Becker as Ellen Hendry\n* [[Stephen Furst]] as Aldo\n* [[Arliss Howard]] as Tom Cooper\n* Stan Wilson as Vinnie Conrad\n* [[Harry Bugin]] as Man at phone\n{{col-end}}\n\n== Production ==\n''The Day After'' was the idea of ABC Motion Picture Division President [[Brandon Stoddard]],<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/24/business/media/brandon-stoddard-77-abc-executive-who-brought-roots-to-tv-is-dead.html|title=Brandon Stoddard, 77, ABC Executive Who Brought 'Roots' to TV, Is Dead|last=Weber|first=Bruce|date=2014-12-23|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-03-18}}</ref> who, after watching ''[[The China Syndrome]]'', was so impressed that he envisioned creating a film exploring the effects of nuclear war on the United States. Stoddard asked his executive vice president of television movies and miniseries, Stu Samuels, to develop a script. Samuels created the title ''The Day After'' to emphasize that the story was about not a nuclear war itself but the aftermath. Samuels suggested several writers, and eventually, Stoddard commissioned the veteran television writer [[Edward Hume]] to write the script in 1981. ABC, which financed the production, was concerned about the graphic nature of the film and how to portray the subject appropriately on a family-oriented television channel. Hume undertook a massive amount of research on nuclear war and went through several drafts until ABC finally deemed the plot and characters acceptable.\n\nOriginally, the film was based more around and in Kansas City, Missouri. Kansas City was not bombed in the original script although [[Whiteman Air Force Base]] was, which made Kansas City suffer shock waves and the horde of survivors staggering into town. There was no Lawrence, Kansas, in the story although there was a small Kansas town called \"Hampton.\" While Hume was writing the script, he and the producer Robert Papazian, who had great experience in on-location shooting, took several trips to Kansas City to scout locations and met with officials from the Kansas film commission and from the Kansas tourist offices to search for a suitable location for \"Hampton.\" It came down to a choice of either [[Warrensburg, Missouri]], and Lawrence, Kansas, both college towns. Warrensburg the was home of [[Central Missouri State University]] and was near Whiteman Air Force Base, and Lawrence was home of the [[University of Kansas]] and was near Kansas City. Hume and Papazian ended up selecting Lawrence because of the access to a number of good locations: a university, a hospital, football and basketball venues, farms, and a flat countryside. Lawrence was also agreed upon as being the \"geographic center\" of the United States. The Lawrence people were urging ABC to change the name \"Hampton\" to \"Lawrence\" in the script.\n\nBack in Los Angeles, the idea of making a TV movie showing the true effects of nuclear war on average American citizens was still stirring up controversy. ABC, Hume, and Papazian realized that for the scene depicting the nuclear blast, they would have to use state-of-the-art special effects and so took the first step by hiring some of the best special effects people in the business to draw up some storyboards for the complicated blast scene. ABC then hired Robert Butler to direct the project. For several months, the group worked on drawing up storyboards and revising the script again and again. Then, in early 1982, Butler was forced to leave ''The Day After'' because of other contractual commitments. ABC then offered the project to two other directors, who both turned it down. Finally, in May, ABC hired the feature film director [[Nicholas Meyer]], who had just completed the blockbuster ''[[Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan]]''. Meyer was apprehensive at first and doubted ABC would get away with making a television film on nuclear war without the censors diminishing its effect. However, after reading the script, Meyer agreed to direct ''The Day After''.\n\nMeyer wanted to make sure that he would film the script he was offered. He did not want the censors to censor the film or the film to be a regular Hollywood disaster movie from the start. Meyer figured the more ''The Day After'' resembled such a film, the less effective it would be, and he preferred to present the facts of nuclear war to viewers. He made it clear to ABC that no big TV or film stars should be in ''The Day After''. ABC agreed but wanted to have one star to help attract European audiences to the film when it would be shown theatrically there. Later, while flying to visit his parents in New York City, Meyer happened to be on the same plane with [[Jason Robards]] and asked him to join the cast.\n\nMeyer plunged into several months of nuclear research, which made him quite pessimistic about the future, to the point of becoming ill each evening when he came home from work. Meyer and Papazian also made trips to the ABC censors and to the [[United States Department of Defense]] during their research phase and experienced conflicts with both. Meyer had many heated arguments over elements in the script that the network censors wanted cut out of the film. The Department of Defense said that it would cooperate with ABC if the script clarified that the Soviets launched their missiles first, which Meyer and Papazian took pains not to do.\n\nMeyer, Papazian, Hume, and several casting directors spent most of July 1982 taking numerous trips to Kansas City. In between casting in Los Angeles, where they relied mostly on unknowns, they would fly to the Kansas City area to interview local actors and scenery. They were hoping to find some real Midwesterners for smaller roles. Hollywood casting directors strolled through shopping malls in Kansas City to look for local people to fill small and supporting roles, and the daily newspaper in Lawrence ran an advertisement calling for local residents of all ages to sign up for jobs as many extras in the film and a professor of theater and film at the [[University of Kansas]] were hired to head up the local casting of the movie. Out of the eighty or so speaking parts, only fifteen were cast in Los Angeles. The remaining roles were filled in Kansas City and Lawrence.\n\nWhile in Kansas City, Meyer and Papazian toured the [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]] offices in Kansas City. When asked about its plans for surviving nuclear war, a FEMA official replied that it was experimenting with putting evacuation instructions in [[telephone book]]s in [[New England]]. \"In about six years, everyone should have them.\" That meeting led Meyer to later refer to FEMA as \"a complete joke.\" It was during that time that the decision was made to change \"Hampton\" in the script to \"Lawrence.\" Meyer and Hume figured since Lawrence was a real town, it would be more believable, and besides, it was a perfect choice to play a representative of [[Middle America (United States)|Middle America]]. The town boasted a \"socio-cultural mix,\" sat near the exact geographic center of the Continental U.S., and was a prime missile target according to Hume and Meyer's research because 150 [[Minuteman missile]] silos stood nearby. Lawrence had some great locations, and its people were more supportive of the project. Suddenly, less emphasis was put on Kansas City, the decision was made to have the city annihilated in the script, and Lawrence was made the primary location in the film.\n\n=== Editing ===\nABC originally planned to air ''The Day After'' as a four-hour \"television event\" that would be spread over two nights with a total running time of 180 minutes without commercials.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Naha|first=Ed|date=April 1983|title=L.A. Offbeat: A Lesson in Reality|url=https://archive.org/details/starlog_magazine-069|journal=Starlog|pages=[https://archive.org/details/starlog_magazine-069/page/n23 24]\u201325}}</ref> The director Nicholas Meyer felt the original script was padded, and suggested cutting out an hour of material to present the whole film in one night. The network stuck with its two-night broadcast plan, and Meyer filmed the entire three-hour script, as evidenced by a 172-minute workprint that has surfaced.<ref>{{Citation|last=nisus8|title=The Day After (1983) - 3-Hour Workprint Version|date=2018-08-10|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MobwUGgdI3A| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180911120906/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MobwUGgdI3A| archive-date=2018-09-11 | url-status=dead|access-date=2019-05-23}}</ref> Subsequently, the network found that it was difficult to find advertisers because of the subject matter. ABC relented and allowed Meyer to edit the film for a one-night broadcast version. Meyer's original single-night cut ran two hours and twenty minutes, which he presented to the network. After that screening, many executives were deeply moved, and some even cried, which led Meyer to believe they approved of his cut.\n\nNevertheless, a further six-month struggle ensued over the final shape of the film. Network censors had opinions about the inclusion of specific scenes, and ABC itself was eventually intent on \"trimming the film to the bone\" and made demands to cut out many scenes that Meyer strongly lobbied to keep. Finally, Meyer and his editor, Bill Dornisch, balked. Dornisch was fired, and Meyer walked away from the project. ABC brought in other editors, but the network ultimately was not happy with the results they produced. It finally brought Meyer back and reached a compromise, with Meyer paring down ''The Day After'' to a final running time of 120 minutes.<ref name=\"fallout\">{{cite web|last=Niccum|first=John|title=Fallout from ''The Day After''|url=http://www.lawrence.com/news/2003/nov/19/fallout_from/|work=lawrence.com|access-date=October 11, 2011|date=2003-11-19}}</ref><ref>Meyer, Nicholas, \"The View From the Bridge: Memories of Star Trek and a Life in Hollywood\", page 150. Viking Adult, 2009</ref>\n\n=== Broadcast ===\n''The Day After'' was initially scheduled to premiere on ABC in May 1983, but the post-production work to reduce the film's length pushed back its initial airdate to November. Censors forced ABC to cut an entire scene of a child having a nightmare about [[nuclear holocaust]] and then sitting up screaming. A psychiatrist told ABC that it would disturb children. \"This strikes me as ludicrous,\" Meyer wrote in ''[[TV Guide]]'' at the time, \"not only in relation to the rest of the film, but also when contrasted with the huge doses of violence to be found on any average evening of TV viewing.\" In any case, a few more cuts were made, including to a scene in which Denise possesses a [[diaphragm (contraceptive)|diaphragm]]. Another scene in which a hospital patient abruptly sits up screaming was excised from the original television broadcast but restored for home video releases. Meyer persuaded ABC to dedicate the film to the citizens of Lawrence and also to put a disclaimer at the end of the film after the credits to let the viewer know that ''The Day After'' downplayed the true effects of nuclear war so it could have a story. The disclaimer also included a list of books that provided more information on the subject.\n\n''The Day After'' received a large promotional campaign prior to its broadcast. Commercials aired several months in advance, and ABC distributed half-a-million \"viewer's guides\" that discussed the dangers of nuclear war and prepared the viewer for the graphic scenes of mushroom clouds and radiation burn victims. Discussion groups were also formed nationwide.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Atomic War Film Spurs Nationwide Discussion|last=McFadden|first=Robert D.|date=November 22, 1983|work=The New York Times}}</ref>\n\n=== Music ===\nThe composer [[David Raksin]] wrote original music and adapted music from ''[[The River (1938 film)|The River]]'', a documentary film score by the concert composer [[Virgil Thomson]], by featuring an adaptation of the hymn \"[[How Firm a Foundation (hymn)|How Firm a Foundation]]\". Although he recorded just under 30 minutes of music, much of it was edited out of the final cut. Music from the [[First Strike (1979 film)|''First Strike'']] footage, conversely, was not edited out.\n\n=== Deleted and alternative scenes ===\n{{more citations needed section|date=October 2011}}\nThe film was shortened from the original three hours of running time to two, which caused the scrapping of several planned special-effects scenes although storyboards were made in anticipation of a possible \"expanded\" version. They included a \"bird's eye\" view of Kansas City at the moment of two nuclear detonations as seen from a [[Boeing 737]] airliner approaching the city's airport, simulated newsreel footage of U.S. troops in [[West Germany]] taking up positions in preparation of advancing Soviet armored units, and the tactical nuclear exchange in Germany between NATO and the Warsaw Pact after the attacking Warsaw Pact force breaks through and overwhelms the NATO lines.\n\nABC censors severely toned down scenes to reduce the body count or severe burn victims. Meyer refused to remove key scenes, but reportedly, some eight-and-a-half minutes of excised footage still exist, significantly more graphic. Some footage was reinstated for the film's release on home video. Additionally, the nuclear attack scene was longer and supposed to feature very graphic and very accurate shots of what happens to a human body during a nuclear blast. Examples included people being set on fire; their flesh carbonizing; being burned to the bone; eyes melting; faceless heads; skin hanging; deaths from flying glass and debris, limbs torn off, being crushed, and blown from buildings by the shockwave; and people in fallout shelters suffocating during the firestorm. Also cut were images of radiation sickness, as well as graphic post-attack violence from survivors such as food riots, looting, and general lawlessness as authorities attempted to restore order.\n\nOne cut scene showed surviving students battling over food. The two sides were to be athletes and the science students under the guidance of Professor Huxley. Another brief scene that was later cut related to a firing squad in which two U.S. soldiers are blindfolded and executed. In that scene, an officer reads the charges, verdict, and sentence as a bandaged chaplain reads the [[Anointing of the Sick (Catholic Church)|Last Rites]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2020}} A similar sequence occurs in a 1965 British-produced faux documentary, ''[[The War Game]]''. In the initial 1983 broadcast of ''The Day After'', when the U.S. president addresses the nation, the voice was an imitation of President Reagan, who later stated that he watched the film and was deeply moved.<ref>Archived at [https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211205/7QdZqBKwTMs Ghostarchive]{{cbignore}} and the [https://web.archive.org/web/20131209131151/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7QdZqBKwTMs Wayback Machine]{{cbignore}}: {{cite web| url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7QdZqBKwTMs| title = The Day After: \"Reagan-esque\" Presidential Address | website=[[YouTube]]}}{{cbignore}}</ref> In subsequent broadcasts, that voice was overdubbed by a stock actor.\n\nHome video releases in the U.S. and internationally come in at various running times, many listed at 126 or 127 minutes. Full screen (4:3 aspect ratio) seems to be more common than widescreen. RCA videodiscs of the early 1980s were limited to 2 hours per disc so that full screen release appears to be closest to what originally aired on ABC in the U.S. A 2001 U.S. VHS version (Anchor Bay Entertainment, Troy, Michigan) lists a running time of 122 minutes. A 1995 double laser disc \"director's cut\" version (Image Entertainment) runs 127 minutes, includes commentary by director Nicholas Meyer and is \"presented in its 1.75:1 European theatrical aspect ratio\" (according to the LD jacket).\n\nTwo different German DVD releases run at 122 and 115 minutes respectively; the edits reportedly downplay the Soviet Union's role.<ref>[https://www.movie-censorship.com/report.php?ID=193898 Movie-censorship.com]</ref>\n\nA two disc Blu-ray special edition<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.kinolorber.com/product/the-day-after-2-disc-special-edition-blu-ray|title = The Day After (2-Disc Special Edition)}}</ref> was released in 2018 by the video specialty label [[Kino International (company)|Kino Lorber]] and present the film in high definition.

Sagan described the [[nuclear arms race|arms race]] in the following terms: \"Imagine a room awash in gasoline, and there are two implacable enemies in that room.
