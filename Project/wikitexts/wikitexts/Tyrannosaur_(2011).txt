After burying Bluey, he goes to the post office, where he causes a confrontation with several Pakistani employees and later attacks three men who were teasing him at his local pub. After fleeing the pub, he hides in a second-hand shop, where a compassionate employee, Hannah, offers to pray for him. Joseph later returns home and encounters his six-year-old neighbor Samuel, who is forced to wait outside his own house while his mother is inside with her abusive boyfriend. The next morning, Joseph wakes up and goes to Hannah's shop where she tends to his injuries. Despite her compassion, he begins to berate and insult her. She listens to him without commenting but her eyes fill with tears.\n\nHannah returns home, drinks wine and falls asleep. When her husband James arrives and is unable to awaken her, he urinates on her. After Hannah arrives at work the next morning, Joseph comes by to apologize for his behavior the previous day, and they go for a drink. That night, James tells Hannah that someone saw her earlier that day with another man, which she denies. When Hannah comes to work the following morning with a black eye, she tells Joseph that she fell in the bath. Later on, in the back room, she drinks from a bottle of vodka. Joseph later returns to the shop once again to ask Hannah to join him to pray for his best friend Jack, who is dying of cancer. Jack dies a few days later and Joseph returns to get a suit for his funeral. James enters and finds Hannah tying Joseph's tie as he tries on a suit and quietly threatens her. Joseph hears enough of this to realize that James was the cause of Hannah's black eye. She continues to claim that she simply fell in the tub but she is visibly upset. She asks Joseph to immediately leave the store.\n\nAfter work, Hannah is afraid to go home for fear of what her husband will do to her. With nowhere else to go, she finds a bar and drinks alone. Upon discovering her location, James comes to pick her up which leads to a violent altercation back at home, in which James brutally rapes Hannah at knifepoint until she blacks out. The next day, Hannah leaves home, finds Joseph and tells him she is leaving James, asking to stay with him because she has nowhere else to go. He hesitatingly agrees, and in the course of her settling in, Joseph reveals that his heavy-set wife has been dead for 5 years due to complications from her [[diabetes]]. He also tells Hannah that he regrets using the nickname \"[[Tyrannosaur]]\" for his wife. He used it because it reminded Joseph of the scene in the film ''[[Jurassic Park]]'' where the [[Tyrannosaurus Rex]] could be heard stomping after the children in the film, much like how his wife sounded when she was walking up the stairs of their house. At the time, he'd thought it was funny but he expresses guilt for the way he treated her. After a few days, Joseph tells her that she is not safe with him and suggests she leave. Joseph escorts Hannah back to her house to retrieve some personal items, but Hannah ends up running away, saying she is not ready to confront her husband. Later that day, after attending the wake of an old friend, Joseph decides to confront James. He takes Hannah's keys and goes to her house where he finds James's corpse propped up against the closet door. Shocked, he returns home and confronts Hannah, saying that he knows she killed her husband. At first she is confused, but then breaks down and reveals that James had been brutally abusing her for a long time.\n\nA year later, it is revealed that Hannah is in prison. Joseph tells her in a letter that Samuel was mauled by his mother's boyfriend's dog. In retaliation, Joseph beheaded the dog with a machete. He also admits that he had always admired her from afar, as she was the only person in town to smile at him and show him kindness, which is why he had approached her in the first place. Despite everything, they both appear hopeful for a better future.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Peter Mullan]] as Joseph\n*[[Olivia Colman]] as Hannah\n*[[Eddie Marsan]] as James\n*[[Paul Popplewell]] as Bod\n*[[Samuel Bottomley]] as Samuel\n*[[Sian Breckin]] as Samuel's Mum\n*[[Ned Dennehy]] as Tommy\n*[[Sally Carman]] as Marie\n*[[Julia Mallam]] as Drunk Woman\n*Andrew Milburn as Guy in Pub\n*Natalia Carta as Drunk Woman's friend\n\n==Production==\n''Tyrannosaur'' is an expansion of ''[[Dog Altogether]]'', a short film for [[Warp Films]] that Considine wrote and directed, which won the Best Short Film BAFTA and BIFA awards as well as the Silver Lion award at Venice in 2007. The film received a grant of \u00a3206,540 from the [[UK Film Council|National Lottery fund through the UK Film Council]]. The remainder of the film's budget came from [[Warp X]], Inflammable Films, [[Film4 Productions|Film4]], [[Screen Yorkshire]], EM Media and [[Optimum Releasing]] ([[StudioCanal]]). It depicts an environment similar to what Considine witnessed growing up on a [[council estate]] in the [[Midlands (England)|Midlands]], although the film is in no way autobiographical. The film's title is a metaphor, the meaning of which is revealed in the film.\n\nThe film is set in an unspecified town in the North of England, although much of it was shot on location in residential areas of [[Leeds]] and [[Wakefield]], including Seacroft, Cross Gates, Eccup, Harehills and Alwoodley, and the accents of many of the main characters are drawn from a wide geographical area. The film  makes reference to the fictional Manners Estate as an area in the town where the more wealthy inhabitants reside. Manners Estate is the name of the council estate in the parish of Winshill near [[Burton-on-Trent]] where Paddy Considine grew up.\n\nMany of the extras used in the film were local residents, including local busker Chris Wheat who was given a part after singing to the cast and crew on set. He performs his own original song in the film. Workers from the local St Vincent's Charity Shop used in the film were also given small parts. Several other small roles were given to members of the crew, including the film's producer Diarmid Scrimshaw, the film's make-up designer Nadia Stacey, and the production coordinator Samantha Milnes who was featured in a photo as Joseph's late wife. The film is dedicated to Considine's late mother, Pauline Considine. The end credits gives special thanks to both [[James Marsh (director)|James Marsh]] and [[Gary Oldman]].\n\n==Soundtrack==\n#\"Wand'rin' Star\" \u2013 [[Nick Hemming]] (of [[The Leisure Society]]), [[cover version|cover]] of [[Lee Marvin]]'s 1969 [[Wand'rin' Star|hit song]] from the western musical film ''[[Paint Your Wagon (film)|Paint Your Wagon]]''<ref name=Soundtrack>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1204340/soundtrack|title=''Tyrannosaur'' (2011) - Soundtracks|access-date=26 July 2013 |publisher=[[Internet Movie Database]]}}</ref>\n#\"This Gun Loves you Back\" \u2013 Chris Baldwin (written By Paddy Considine & Chris Baldwin)<ref name=Soundtrack/>\n#\"Truth or Glory\" \u2013 JJ All Stars<ref name=Soundtrack/>\n#\"Saturday Night\" \u2013 JJ All Stars<ref name=Soundtrack/>\n#\"Psycho Mash\" \u2013 JJ All Stars<ref name=Soundtrack/>\n#\"Hi Jack\" \u2013 Chris Wheat<ref name=Soundtrack/>\n#\"Sing All Our Cares Away\" \u2013 [[Damien Dempsey]]<ref name=Soundtrack/>\n#\"We Were Wasted\" \u2013 [[The Leisure Society]]<ref name=Soundtrack/>\n\nOriginal music composed by Chris Baldwin & Dan Baker\n\n==Reception==\n===Box office===\nThe film grossed \u00a3396,930, below its \u00a3750,000 production budget.<ref name=\"boxofficemojo1\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=https://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?page=intl&id=tyrannosaur.htm|title=Tyrannosaur (2011) - International Box Office Results|date=12 January 2012|publisher=Box Office Mojo|access-date=4 October 2017|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120112223147/http://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?page=intl&id=tyrannosaur.htm|archive-date=12 January 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Critical response===\n''Tyrannosaur'' received positive reviews.
