It was shot on location in a [[Roberto Rossellini]]-inspired [[newsreel]] style: in black and white with documentary-type editing to add to its sense of historical authenticity, with mostly non-professional actors who had lived through the real battle.

The narrative begins with the organization of revolutionary cells in the [[Casbah of Algiers|Casbah]]. Because of [[Partisan (military)|partisan]] warfare between the Algerian locals and [[Pied-Noir]], in which both sides commit acts of increasing violence, France sends [[French Army]] paratroopers to the city to fight against and capture members of the [[National Liberation Front (Algeria)|National Liberation Front]] (FLN). The paratroopers are depicted as neutralizing the whole of the FLN leadership through either assassination or capture. The film ends with a [[coda (music)|coda]] depicting nationalist demonstrations and riots, suggesting that although France won the Battle of Algiers, it lost the Algerian War.<ref name=Guardian/>\n\nThe tactics of the FLN guerrilla [[insurgency]] and the French [[Counter-insurgency|counter insurgency]], and the uglier incidents of the war are depicted. Both colonizer and colonized commit atrocities against civilians. The FLN commandeer the Casbah via [[summary execution]] of Algerian criminals and suspected French collaborators; they commit [[terrorism]], including actions like the real-life [[Zohra Drif#Milk Bar Caf\u00e9 bombing|Milk Bar Caf\u00e9 bombing]], to harass Europeans. The security forces resort to killings and indiscriminate violence against the opposition. French paratroops are depicted as routinely using [[Torture during the Algerian War|torture]], intimidation, and murder.<ref name=Guardian/>\n\nPontecorvo and Solinas created several protagonists in their screenplay who are based on historical war figures. The story begins and ends from the perspective of [[Ali la Pointe]] ([[Brahim Haggiag]]), a petty criminal who is politically radicalized while in prison. He is recruited by FLN commander El-hadi Jafar, played by [[Saadi Yacef]], who was a veteran FLN commander.<ref>Benjamin Stora, [https://books.google.com/books?id=AnWDLE23YwQC&pg=PA20 ''Les Mots de la Guerre d'Alg\u00e9rie''], Presses Universitaires du Mirail, 2005, p. 20.</ref>\n\nLieutenant-Colonel Mathieu, the paratroop commander, is the principal French character. Other characters are the boy [[Little Omar|Petit Omar]], a [[street urchin]] who is an FLN messenger; [[Larbi Ben M'hidi]], a top FLN leader who provides the political rationale for the insurgency; and [[Djamila Bouhired|Djamila]], [[Zohra Drif|Zohra]], and [[Hassiba Benbouali|Hassiba]], three FLN women [[Urban guerrilla warfare|urban guerrillas]] who carry out a terrorist attack. ''The Battle of Algiers'' also features thousands of Algerian extras. Pontecorvo intended to have them portray the \"Casbah-as-[[Greek chorus|chorus]]\", communicating with chanting, wailing, and physical effect.<ref name=\"SlowLooking\"/>\n\n==Production and style==\n\n===Screenplay===\n[[File:Alger algiers casbah 1900.jpg|thumb|The [[Casbah of Algiers|Casbah]], where the film was shot]]\n''The Battle of Algiers'' was inspired by the 1962 book ''Souvenirs de la Bataille d'Alger'', an FLN military commander's account of the campaign, by [[Saadi Yacef]].<ref>\"The Source\". ''The Battle of Algiers'' booklet accompanying the Criterion Collection DVD release, p. 14.</ref> Yacef wrote the book while he was held as a prisoner of the French, and it served to boost morale for the FLN and other militants. After independence, the French released Yacef, who became a leader in the new government. The Algerian government backed adapting Yacef's memoir as a film. [[Salash Baazi]], an FLN leader who had been exiled by the French, approached Italian director [[Gillo Pontecorvo]] and screenwriter [[Franco Solinas]] with the project.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}}\n\nYacef wrote his own screenplay, which does not have any conversations or plot.<ref>''The Battle of Algiers'' booklet accompanying the Criterion Collection DVD release, p. 14.</ref> The Italian producers rejected it as too biased towards the Algerians. Although sympathetic to Algerian nationalism, the producers wanted the film to deal with events from a more neutral perspective. The final screenplay of ''The'' ''Battle of Algiers'' has an Algerian protagonist and depicts the cruelty and suffering of both Algerians and the French, ''[[pieds-noir]]'' and military forces.<ref>Peter Matthews, \"''The Battle of Algiers'': Bombs and Boomerangs\", in ''The Battle of Algiers'' booklet accompanying the Criterion Collection DVD release, p. 7.</ref>\n\nTo meet the demands of film, ''The Battle of Algiers'' uses composite characters and changes the names of certain persons. For example, Colonel Mathieu is a [[composite character|composite]] of several French counterinsurgency officers, especially [[Jacques Massu]].<ref>Arun Kapil, \"Selected Biographies of Participants in the French-Algerian War\", in ''The Battle of Algiers'' booklet accompanying the Criterion Collection DVD release, p. 50.</ref> Saadi Yacef has said that Mathieu was based more on [[Marcel Bigeard]], although the character is also reminiscent of [[Roger Trinquier]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rfi.fr/actufr/articles/058/article_31407.asp |title=Cinquantenaire de l'insurrection alg\u00e9rienne La Bataille d'Alger, une le\u00e7on de l'histoire |publisher=Rfi.fr |date=2004-10-29 |access-date=2010-03-07}}</ref> Accused of portraying Mathieu as too elegant and noble, screenwriter Solinas denied that this was his intention.

The effect was so convincing that American releases carried a notice that \"not one foot\" of newsreel was used.<ref>J. David Slocum, ''Terrorism, Media, Liberation.'' [[Rutgers University Press]], 2005, p. 25.</ref>\n\nPontecorvo's use of fictional realism enables the movie \"to operate along a double-bind as it consciously addresses different audiences.\" The film makes special use of television in order to link western audiences with images they are constantly faced with that are asserted to express the \"truth\". The film seems to be filmed through the point of view of a western reporter, as [[telephoto lens]]es and hand-held cameras are used, whilst \"depicting the struggle from a 'safe' distance with French soldiers placed between the crowds and camera.\"<ref>Barr Burlin, ''Lyrical Contact Zones: Cinematic Representation and the Transformation of the Exotic.'' [[Cornell University Press]], 1999, p 158.</ref>\n\n===Cast===\n[[File:Battle-of-Algiers-screenshot.jpg|thumb|250px|Mahmoud, [[Hassiba Ben Bouali|Halima]], [[Little Omar]], and [[Ali La Pointe]] in the hideout]]\nPontecorvo chose to cast non-professional Algerians. He chose people whom he met, picking them mainly on appearance and emotional effect (as a result, many of their lines were dubbed).<ref>Peter Matthews, \"The Battle of Algiers: Bombs and Boomerangs\", p. 8.</ref> The sole professional actor of the movie was [[Jean Martin]], who played Colonel Mathieu; Martin was a French actor who had worked primarily in theatre. Pontecorvo wanted a professional actor, but one who would not be familiar to most audiences, as this could have interfered with the movie's intended realism.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}}\n\nMartin had been dismissed several years earlier from the [[Th\u00e9\u00e2tre National Populaire]] for signing the [[manifesto of the 121]] against the Algerian War. Martin was a veteran; he had served in a paratroop regiment during the [[Indochina War]] and he had taken part in the [[French Resistance]]. His portrayal had autobiographical depth. According to an interview with screenwriter [[Franco Solinas]], the working relationship between Martin and Pontecorvo was not always easy. Unsure whether Martin's professional acting style would contrast too much with the non-professionals, Pontecorvo argued about Martin's acting choices.<ref>PierNico Solinas, \"An Interview with Franco Solinas\", in ''The Battle of Algiers'' booklet accompanying the Criterion Collection DVD, <!-- date? --></ref>\n\nSaadi Yacef, who plays El-Hadi Jaffar, and Samia Kerbash, who plays Fathia, were both members of the FLN and Pontecorvo is said to have been greatly inspired by their accounts. The actors credited are:\n\n* [[Jean Martin]] as Colonel Philippe Mathieu\n* [[Saadi Yacef]] as El-Hadi Jafar\n* [[Brahim Haggiag]] as [[Ali La Pointe]]\n* Tommaso Neri as Captain Dubois\n* Samia Kerbash as Fathia\n* Ugo Paletti as a Captain\n* Fusia El Kader as [[Hassiba Ben Bouali|Halima]]\n* Franco Moruzzi as Mahmoud\n* Mohamed Ben Kassen as [[Little Omar]]\n\n===Sound and music===\nSound &ndash; both music and effects &ndash; perform important functions in the movie. Indigenous Algerian drumming, rather than dialogue, is heard during a scene in which female FLN militants prepare for a bombing. In addition, Pontecorvo used the sounds of gunfire, helicopters and truck engines to symbolize the French methods of battle, while bomb blasts, [[ululation]], wailing and chanting symbolize the Algerian methods. Gillo Pontecorvo wrote the music for ''The Battle of Algiers'', but because he was classified as a \"melodist-composer\" in Italy, he was required to work with another composer as well; his good friend [[Ennio Morricone]] collaborated with him. The solo military drum, which is heard throughout the film, is played by the famous Italian drummer Pierino Munari.<ref>Mellen, Joan (1973). ''Film Guide to The Battle Algiers'', p. 13.
