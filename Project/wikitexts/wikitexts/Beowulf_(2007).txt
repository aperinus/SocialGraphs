Starring the voices of [[Ray Winstone]], [[Anthony Hopkins]], [[Robin Wright Penn]], [[Brendan Gleeson]], [[John Malkovich]], [[Crispin Glover]], [[Alison Lohman]] and [[Angelina Jolie]], the film features human characters animated using [[live-action]] [[motion-capture]] CGI animation, which was previously used in ''[[The Polar Express (film)|The Polar Express]]'' (2004) and ''[[Monster House (film)|Monster House]]'' (2006).\n\nProduced by Zemeckis' [[ImageMovers]] and [[Shangri-La Entertainment]], the film premiered at [[Westwood, Los Angeles]] on November 5, 2007 and was released theatrically in the United States on November 16, 2007, by [[Paramount Pictures]], and [[Warner Bros. Pictures]] handling international distribution. The film received moderately positive reviews from critics, who complimented the CGI visual-effects, CGI performance-capture and voice acting whilst criticizing aspects of the interpretation of the poem. The film underperformed at the box office, having earned only $196.4 million on a $150 million budget (not including marketing costs).\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- PER WP:FILMPLOT, PLOT SUMMARIES IN FILM ARTICLES SHOULD BE BETWEEN 400 AND 700 WORDS. -->\nIn 507, the legendary [[Geats|Geatish]] warrior [[Beowulf (hero)|Beowulf]] travels to Denmark with his band of soldiers including his best friend [[Wiglaf]] to help King [[Hrothgar]], who needs a hero to slay [[Grendel]], a hideously malformed troll-like creature with appalling strength and cunning who attacked and killed many of Hrothgar's warriors during a celebration in the [[mead hall]] [[Heorot]]. Upon arriving, Beowulf becomes attracted to Hrothgar's wife Queen [[Wealtheow]].\n\nThe men celebrate in Heorot to lure Grendel out while Beowulf strips naked and relaxes so that when the beast attacks, they can have a fair and equal fight. During the fight, Beowulf discovers that Grendel has [[Hyperacusis|hypersensitive hearing]] and ruptures the creature's eardrum. Grendel shrinks in size and manages to escape only after Beowulf severs his arm, mortally wounding him. In thanks for freeing his kingdom from the monster, Hrothgar gives Beowulf his golden drinking horn, which commemorates Hrothgar's victory over the mighty dragon [[Fafnir]].\n\nIn his cave, [[Grendel's mother]] swears revenge over his corpse. She travels to Heorot and slaughters Beowulf's men in the night. Hrothgar tells both Beowulf and Wiglaf that Grendel's mother is the last of the [[Water spirit|Water Demons]]. Hrothgar's adviser, [[Unfer\u00f0|Unferth]], offers Beowulf his sword [[Hrunting]] to slay Grendel's mother. Beowulf and Wiglaf then travel to the demon's cave, where Beowulf enters alone and encounters the demon, who takes the form of a beautiful, gold-covered naked woman. He tries to kill her with Hrunting but fails due to her magic. Instead, she seduces him with promises to make him king in exchange for the drinking horn and a son to replace Grendel, which Beowulf agrees to when they both kiss.\n\nAfterwards, Beowulf returns to Heorot with Grendel's head and announces he has killed his mother the demon. He recounts embellished stories of a fight, claiming he left the sword impaled in the body of Grendel's mother and lost the golden drinking horn in the battle. Hrothgar speaks to Beowulf privately, and asks if he truly killed Grendel's mother. Despite Beowulf's boasting and calling Grendel's mother a '[[hag]]', Hrothgar is not fooled and indirectly reveals he had been seduced by the demon, and Grendel was the result of their tryst. Hrothgar says all that matters is that Grendel is dead and the curse of Grendel's mother is no longer his to bear. Beowulf then realizes that the curse has now been passed on to him after his affair with the demon. Hrothgar declares Beowulf to be king upon his death and he then commits suicide by jumping from the castle parapet onto the beach below. Grendel's mother appears as a gold light in the surf, and drags Hrothgar's corpse into the sea as the crowd kneels to the newly-crowned King Beowulf, fulfilling their bargain.\n\nFifty years later, the elderly Beowulf is the estranged husband of Wealtheow, who has converted to Christianity. Beowulf has a mistress, Ursula, but his tryst with Grendel's mother has left him sterile to both his wife and mistress. On the anniversary of Beowulf's victory against Grendel, Unferth returns the golden drinking horn, which his slave had found on the moors. That night, a nearby village is destroyed by a [[The dragon (Beowulf)|dragon]], which then transforms into a golden figure, who orders Unferth to give a message to King Beowulf, the dragon's father: the sins of the father have returned to him (referencing the [[Faustian bargain]] curse cycle, which Wealtheow knows about). Afterwards, Beowulf privately confesses to Wealtheow about his affair with Grendel's mother and they reconcile.\n\nBeowulf and Wiglaf go to the cave once again, and Beowulf enters alone. When Grendel's mother appears, Beowulf throws her the golden horn, but she refuses it and the dragon attacks Beowulf's castle, threatening Wealtheow and Ursula. Despite his age, Beowulf goes to great lengths to stop the dragon. Beowulf is mortally wounded in the struggle, but manages to kill the dragon by ripping its heart out, and he and the creature tumble to the rocky beach below the castle. The dragon transforms into its golden humanoid form, before being washed out to sea. Before he dies, Beowulf tries to tell Wiglaf the truth about his affair with Grendel's mother and acknowledge his son, but Wiglaf insists on keeping his legacy intact.\n\nAs the new king, Wiglaf gives Beowulf a [[Norse funeral]]. Wiglaf finds the golden horn in the sand and sees Grendel's mother give Beowulf a final kiss as his burning ship sinks into the sea. Grendel's mother slowly rises to the water's surface and seductively beckons Wiglaf towards her. He wades into the sea, while holding the golden drinking horn, before pausing halfway in the surf. They both stare at each other, with Grendel's mother seductively waiting and Wiglaf clearly tempted.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Ray Winstone]] as [[Beowulf (hero)|Beowulf]], the [[title character]]. Zemeckis cast Winstone after seeing his performance as the [[Henry VIII of England|title character]] of the 2003 [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] serial ''[[Henry VIII (TV serial)|Henry VIII]]''.<ref name=\"empire\"/> On the topic of the original poem, Winstone commented during an interview, \"I had the beauty of not reading the book, which I understand portrays Beowulf as a very one-dimensional kind of character; a hero and a warrior and that was it. I didn't have any of that baggage to bring with me.\"<ref name=\"bbc\">{{cite news|author=Rob Carnevale |title=Beowulf |publisher=[[BBC]] |date=November 12, 2007 |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/films/2007/11/12/ray_winstone_beowulf_2007_interview.shtml |access-date=2007-11-16}}</ref> Winstone enjoyed working with motion-capture, stating that \"You were allowed to go, like theater, where you carry a scene on and you become engrossed within the scene. I loved the speed of it. There was no time to sit around. You actually cracked on with a scene and your energy levels were kept up. There was no time to actually sit around and lose your concentration. So, for me, I actually really, really enjoyed this experience.\" Unlike some of his castmates, Winstone's animated counterpart bears little resemblance to the actor who was in his early 50s when he filmed the role; Winstone noted that his computer-generated counterpart resembled himself at the age of eighteen, although the filmmakers did not have a photo for reference.<ref name=\"cast\">{{cite news|author=Sheila Roberts |title=Cast of Beowulf Interview |publisher=Movies Online |url=http://www.moviesonline.ca/movienews_13362.html |access-date=2007-11-08 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20071107194529/http://www.moviesonline.ca/movienews_13362.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archive-date = 2007-11-07}}</ref> Winstone also played a dwarf performer, and the \"Golden Man\"/Dragon.<ref name=\"bbc\"/>\n* [[Crispin Glover]] and [[Angelina Jolie]] as [[Grendel]] and his [[Grendel's mother|mother]], the antagonists. Glover had previously worked with Zemeckis in ''[[Back to the Future]]'' when he portrayed [[George McFly]]. Zemeckis had found Glover tiresome on set, because of his lack of understanding of shooting a film, but realized this would not be a problem as on a [[motion-capture]] film he could choose his angles later.<ref>{{cite web|title=Becoming Beowulf |website=[[IGN]] |date=July 25, 2007 |url=http://movies.ign.com/articles/808/808022p1.html |access-date=2007-11-16}}</ref> Glover's dialogue was entirely in [[Old English]].<ref name=\"cast\"/> Jolie had wanted to work with Zemeckis, and had read the poem years before but could not remember it well until she read the script and was able to recall basic themes. The actress recounted her first impression of her character's appearance by saying \"... I was told I was going to be a lizard. Then I was brought into a room with Bob, and a bunch of pictures and examples, and he showed me this picture of a woman half painted gold, and then a lizard. And, I've got kids and I thought 'That's great. That's so bizarre. I'm going to be this crazy reptilian person and creature.'\" Jolie filmed her role over two days when she was three months pregnant. She was startled by the character's nude human form, stating that for an animated film \"I was really surprised that I felt that exposed.\"<ref name=\"cast\"/>\n* [[Anthony Hopkins]] as [[Hrothgar|King Hrothgar]]. Hopkins noted in an interview that since Zemeckis is an American, he wasn't certain what accent Hopkins should use for the role of Hrothgar. Hopkins told him, \"Well, [[Welsh English|Welsh]] would be my closest because that's where I come from.\" It was also his first time working with motion capture technology. Hopkins noted, \"I didn't know what was expected. It was explained to me, I'm not stupid, but I still don't get the idea of how it works. I have no idea [...] you don't have sets, so it is like being in a [[Brecht]] play, you know, with just bare bones and you have nothing else.\" When asked if he had to read the original poem of ''Beowulf'' in school, Hopkins replied: \"No, I was hopeless at school. I couldn't read anything. I mean I could read, but I was so inattentive. I was one of those poor kids, you know, who was just very slow, didn't know what they were talking about... So I tried to get around to reading ''Beowulf'' just before I did this movie, and it was a good modern translation. It was [[Trevor Griffiths]], I'm not sure, but I couldn't hack it, and I tend to like to just go with the script if it's a good script.\"<ref>{{cite news|author=Sheila Roberts |title=Anthony Hopkins Interview, Beowulf |publisher=Movies Online |url=http://www.moviesonline.ca/movienews_13394.html |access-date=2007-11-13 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20071111211024/http://www.moviesonline.ca/movienews_13394.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archive-date = 2007-11-11}}</ref>\n* [[John Malkovich]] as [[Unferth]]. Malkovich became involved in the project because one of his friends, who had worked with Zemeckis, \"spoke very highly of him. I had always found him a very interesting and innovative filmmaker. I liked the script very much and I liked the group involved and the process interested me a great deal also.\" He found the experience of working with motion capture to be similar to his experiences working in the theater. He also found the process intriguing: \"Say you do a normal day of filmmaking. Sometimes that's 1/8 of a page, sometimes it's 3/8th of a page, normally let's say it's 2\u00bd pages, maybe 3. Now it's probably a little more than it used to be but not always. So you may be acting for a total of 20 minutes a day. In this, you act the entire day all the time except for the tiny amount of time it takes them to sort of coordinate the computer information, let's say, and make sure that the computers are reading the data and that you're transmitting the data. It interests me on that level because I'm a professional actor so I'd just as soon act as sit around.\" Malkovich also recalled that he studied the original poem in high school, and that \"I think we got smacked if we couldn't recite a certain number of stanzas. It was in the Old English class and I think my rendition was exemplary.\"<ref>{{cite news|author=Sheila Roberts |title=John Malkovich Interview, Beowulf |publisher=Movies Online |url=http://www.moviesonline.ca/movienews_13412.html |access-date=2007-11-13 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20071114133646/http://www.moviesonline.ca/movienews_13412.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archive-date = 2007-11-14}}</ref>\n* [[Brendan Gleeson]] as [[Wiglaf]], Beowulf's [[lieutenant]]\n* [[Robin Wright Penn]] as [[Wealhtheow|Queen Wealtheow]]\n* [[Alison Lohman]] as Ursula, Beowulf's concubine when he is an old king\n* [[Costas Mandylor]] as Hondshew\n* [[Sebastian Roch\u00e9|Sebastian Roche]] as Wulfgar\n* [[Greg Ellis (actor)|Greg Ellis]] as [[Wermund|Garmund]]\n* Tyler Steelman as Young Cain, Unferth's disabled slave\n* [[Dominic Keating]] as Adult Cain\n* [[Rik Young]] as [[Eofor]]\n* [[Charlotte Salt]] as Estrith\n* Leslie Harter Zemeckis as [[Yrsa]]\n* Fredrik Hiller as [[Finn (Frisian)|Finn of Frisia]]\n\n==Production==\n\n===Development===\nAuthor [[Neil Gaiman]] and screenwriter [[Roger Avary]] wrote a screen adaptation of ''Beowulf'' in May 1997 (they had met while working on a film adaptation of Gaiman's ''[[The Sandman (comic book)|The Sandman]]'' in 1996 before [[Warner Bros.]] canceled it).<ref name=\"empire\">{{cite magazine|author=Tom Ambrose |title=He Is Legend |magazine=[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]] |date=December 2007 |pages=139\u2013142}}</ref> The script had been optioned by [[ImageMovers]] in the same year and set up at [[DreamWorks Pictures|DreamWorks]] with Avary slated to direct and [[Robert Zemeckis]] producing. Avary stated he wanted to make a small-scale, gritty film with a budget of US$15\u201320 million, similar to ''[[Jabberwocky (film)|Jabberwocky]]'' or ''[[Excalibur (film)|Excalibur]]''.<ref name=\"empire\"/> The project eventually went into [[Turnaround (film industry term)|turnaround]] after the option expired, to which the rights returned to Avary, who went on to direct [[The Rules of Attraction (film)|an adaptation]] of ''[[The Rules of Attraction]]''. In January 2005, producer [[Steve Bing]], at the behest of Zemeckis who was wanting to direct the film himself, revived the production by convincing Avary that Zemeckis' vision, supported by the strength of [[Motion capture|digitally enhanced live-action]], was worth relinquishing the directorial reins.<ref>{{cite magazine|author=Nicole Laporte |author2=Claude Brodesser |url=https://www.variety.com/article/VR1117916682.html?categoryid=13&cs=1 |title=Sony, Bing get Anglo on \"Beowulf\" |magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date=January 20, 2005 |access-date=2007-01-13}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|author=Kevil Kelly |title=Comic-Con: 'Beowulf' Footage Screening, Q&A, and Party! |publisher=Cinematical |date=July 26, 2007 |url=http://www.cinematical.com/2007/07/26/comic-con-beowulf-footage-screening-qanda-and-party/ |access-date=2007-11-07}}</ref> Zemeckis did not like the poem, but enjoyed reading the screenplay. Because of the expanded budget, Zemeckis told the screenwriters to rewrite their script, because \"there is nothing that you could write that would cost me more than a million dollars per minute to film. Go wild!\" In particular, the entire fight with the dragon was rewritten from a talky confrontation to a battle spanning the cliffs and the sea.<ref name=\"empire\"/>\n\n===Animation and visual effects===\nZemeckis drew inspiration for the visual-effects of ''Beowulf'' from experience with ''[[The Polar Express (film)|The Polar Express]]'', which uses [[motion-capture]] technology to create [[3D computer graphics|three-dimensional]] CGI images of characters.<ref name=\"VFXFX\">{{cite web|url=http://vfxworld.com/?atype=articles&id=3457 |title=Beowulf: A New Hybrid for an Old Tale |access-date=November 27, 2008 |work=VFXWorld |publisher=AWN, Inc. |year=2007}}</ref> Appointing Jerome Chen, whom Zemeckis worked with on ''The Polar Express'', the two decided to chart realism as their foremost goal.\n\nAnimation supervisor Kenn MacDonald explained that Zemeckis used motion capture because \"Even though it feels like live-action, there were a lot of shots where Bob cut loose. Amazing shots. Impossible with live-action actors. This method of filmmaking gives him freedom and complete control. He doesn't have to worry about lighting. The actors don't have to hit marks. They don't have to know where the camera is. It's pure performance.\" A 25&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;35-foot stage was built, and it used 244 Vicon MX40 cameras. Actors on set wore seventy eight body markers. The cameras recorded real-time footage of the performances, shots which Zemeckis reviewed. The director then used a virtual-camera to choose camera angles from the footage which was edited together. Two teams of animators worked on the film, with one group working on replicating the facial performances, the other working on body movement. The animators said they worked very closely on replicating the human characters, but the character of [[Grendel]] had to be almost reworked, because he is a monster, not human.<ref name=\"cgsociety\">{{cite news |author=Barbara Robertson |title=Beowulf Effects |publisher=CG Society |date=November 28, 2007 |url=http://www.cgsociety.org/index.php/CGSFeatures/CGSFeatureSpecial/beowulf_effects |access-date=2018-05-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180530034728/http://www.cgsociety.org/index.php/CGSFeatures/CGSFeatureSpecial/beowulf_effects |archive-date=May 30, 2018 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nOver 450 graphic designers were chosen for the project, the largest team ever assembled for a [[Sony Pictures Imageworks]]-produced movie as of 2007.<ref name=\"VFXFX\"/> Designers at Imageworks generated new animation tools for facial, body and cloth design especially for the movie, and elements of [[Key frame|keyframe animation]] were incorporated into the film in order to capture the facial expressions of the actors and actresses.<ref name=\"VFXFX\"/> The mead hall battle scene near the beginning of the film, among others, required numerous props that served as additional markers; these markers allowed for a more accurate manifestation of a battlefield setting as the battle progressed.<ref name=\"VFXFX\"/> However, the data being collected by the markers slowed down the studios' computer equipment and five months were spent developing a new save/load system that would increase the efficiency of the studios' resources.<ref name=\"VFXFX\"/> To aid in the process of rendering the massive quantities of information, the development team used [[Cache (computing)|cache]]d data. In the cases that using cached data was not possible, the scenes were rendered using foreground occlusion, which involves the blurring of different overlays of a single scene in an attempt to generate a single scene film.<ref name=\"VFXFX\"/>\n\nOther elements of the film were borrowed from that of others created by Imageworks: ''[[Spider-Man 3]]'' lent the lighting techniques it used and the fluid engine present in the [[Sandman (Marvel Comics)|Sandman]], while the waves of the ocean and the cave of Grendel's mother were modeled after the wave fluid engine used in ''[[Surf's Up (film)|Surf's Up]]''. The 2007 film ''[[Ghost Rider (2007 film)|Ghost Rider]]'' lent ''Beowulf'' the fluid engine that was used to model the movements of protagonist [[Ghost Rider (Johnny Blaze)|Johnny Blaze]].<ref name=\"VFXFX\"/> Jerome Chen worked to process large crowd scenes as early as possible, as additional time would be needed to process these scenes in particular.<ref name=\"VFXFX\"/> As a result, the film's development team designed a priority scale and incorporated it into their [[Microprocessor|processor]]s so graphic artists would be able to work with the scenes when they arrived.<ref name=\"VFXFX\"/>\n\nSo much data was produced in the course of the creation of the film, the studio was forced to upgrade all of its processors to multicore versions, which run quicker and more efficiently. The creation of additional rendering nodes throughout [[Culver City, California]] was necessitated by the movie's production.<ref name=\"VFXFX\"/> Mark Vulcano, who had previously worked on ''[[VeggieTales]]'' and ''[[Monster House (film)|Monster House]]'', served as Senior Character Animator for the film.\n\nIn designing the dragon, production designer [[Doug Chiang]] wanted to create something unique in film. The designers looked at [[bat]]s and [[flying squirrel]]s for inspiration, and also designed its tail to allow underwater propulsion. As the beast is Beowulf's son with Grendel's mother, elements such as Winstone's eyes and cheekbone structure were incorporated into its look.<ref>{{cite news |author=Sheigh Crabtree |title=\"Beowulf\" breathes fire into a new kind of dragon |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=November 4, 2007 |url=http://www.calendarlive.com/movies/cl-ca-beowulf4nov04,0,443706.story?coll=cl-movies |access-date=2007-11-08 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071114132506/http://www.calendarlive.com/movies/cl-ca-beowulf4nov04%2C0%2C443706.story?coll=cl-movies |archive-date=2007-11-14 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The three primary monsters in the film share a [[Gold (color)|golden color scheme]], because they are all related.

For example, Grendel is described as half-man, half-demon. The mother is described as a water-demon. So who's Grendel's father? Grendel's always dragging men off alive to the cave. Why? Why is he never attacking Hrothgar? [\u2026] And if Hrothgar is Grendel's father, then what happens to Beowulf when he goes into that cave? Did he kill the monster? Did he kill Grendel's mother?

There's plenty of action in ''Beowulf'', but even its more vigorous bloodletting pales next to its rich language, exotic setting and mythic grandeur.\"<ref>{{cite news|author=Manohla Dargis|author-link=Manohla Dargis|title=Confronting the Fabled Monster, Not to Mention His Naked Mom |work=The New York Times | date=November 16, 2007 |url=https://movies.nytimes.com/2007/11/16/movies/16beow.html?ex=1195880400&en=e0059fd42f72cf7d&ei=5065&partner=MYWAY |access-date=2007-11-16}}</ref>\n\n===Academic response===\nScholars and authors criticized the changes done upon the poem's story. [[Southern Methodist University]]'s Director of Medieval Studies Bonnie Wheeler is \"convinced that the new Robert Zemeckis movie treatment sacrifices the power of the original for a plot line that propels Beowulf into seduction by Angelina Jolie\u2014the mother of the monster he has just slain. What man doesn't get involved with Angelina Jolie?' Wheeler asks. 'It's a great cop-out on a great poem.' ... 'For me, the sad thing is the movie returns to...a view of the horror of woman, the monstrous female who will kill off the male,' Wheeler says. 'It seems to me you could do so much better now. And the story of ''Beowulf'' is so much more powerful.'\"<ref>{{cite news |title=Beowulf movie cops out with revised theme:It's that evil woman's fault |publisher=SMU |date=November 16, 2007 |url=http://www.smu.edu/newsinfo/pitches/beowulf-16nov2007.asp |access-date=2007-11-27 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071204002147/http://www.smu.edu/newsinfo/pitches/beowulf-16nov2007.asp |archive-date=December 4, 2007 }}</ref> Other commentators pointed to the theories elucidated in John Grigsby's work ''Beowulf and Grendel'', where Grendel's mother was linked with the ancient Germanic fertility goddess [[Nerthus]].<ref>{{cite news|author=Paul Vallely |title=Beowulf: A her for our times |newspaper=The Independent |date=November 10, 2007 |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/film-and-tv/features/beowulf-a-her-for-our-times-399739.html |access-date=2008-10-22}}</ref>\n\nHowever, there were also positive academic reviews. Philosophy professor [[Stephen T. Asma]] argued that \"Zemeckis's more tender-minded film version suggests that the people who cast out Grendel are the real monsters. The monster, according to this charity paradigm, is just misunderstood rather than evil (similar to the version presented in [[John Gardner (American writer)|John Gardner]]'s novel ''[[Grendel (novel)|Grendel]]''). The blame for Grendel's violence is shifted to the humans, who sinned against him earlier and brought the vengeance upon themselves. The only real monsters, in this tradition, are pride and prejudice. In the film, Grendel is even visually altered after his injury to look like an innocent, albeit scaly, little child. In the original ''Beowulf'', the monsters are outcasts because they're bad (just as [[Cain and Abel|Cain]], their progenitor, was outcast because he killed his brother), but in the film ''Beowulf'' the monsters are bad because they're outcasts [...] Contrary to the original ''Beowulf'', the new film wants us to understand and humanize our ''monsters''.\"<ref name=\"chronicle\">{{cite journal|author=Asma Stephen |title=Never Mind Grendel.
