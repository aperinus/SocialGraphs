On the way, they meet a young boy named Adam.\n\nAs Steve and Jenny attempt to wind down, the peaceful setting is disrupted by a gang of rowdy teenagers who have ridden their bicycles to a spot within a few metres of the young couple. Steve asks them to keep the noise down, but is met with abuse. The next morning, Steve and Jenny find their food supplies infested with insects and their car tire damaged by a bottle left behind by the teens. While driving into town for breakfast, Steve spots a house with bikes outside that he thinks belong to the teens. When no one answers the door, Steve enters the house and proceeds to snoop around. But on the return of Jon, the surly homeowner, Steve is obliged to make his escape from an upstairs window.\n\nBack at the lake after waking from a nap, Steve and Jenny discover the bag containing their car keys and Steve's phone and wallet is missing. They return to where they parked their car to discover it is also gone. Returning to town on foot, they avoid a collision with their own car, driven recklessly through the woods by the gang's psychopathic leader, Brett.\n\nFinding the gang in the woods after nightfall, Steve demands the return of his belongings, only to be pounced by the teens who pull out knives. In the scuffle, Brett's dog Bonnie is mortally stabbed, sending Brett into a maniacal rage. The couple grab the keys and flee, but the gang throws stones at the car, causing Steve to crash. With Steve trapped, Jenny is forced to run for help.\n\nAt daybreak, Jenny stumbles upon the group who have tied Steve to a rock with barbed wire. Brett orders each reluctant teen to stab him. When Paige, the female gang member, records Steve's torture on her phone, they realise they have no choice but to kill him. Jenny acts as a decoy and the gang give chase while Steve buys time to free himself. Jenny evades the gang and finds Steve, but is unable to nurse his fatal wounds. She finds an engagement ring in his pocket, and Steve proposes to her before dying. Jenny runs off to find help but accidentally steps on a large spike and her screams get the gang's attention.\n\nJenny runs into Adam and begs for help, but he ends up informing the gang of their location. They tie Jenny, along with Steve's dead body, to a pile of wood; Brett forces Adam to light a bonfire while Paige films it. Jenny is able to escape and Brett burns Adam to death in retaliation. Jenny continues to evade the gang, killing a younger gang member Cooper who was attempting to help her. After finding his body, Brett is thrown into further rage and beats Harry, another gang member, to death. Paige runs away in fear. Jenny reaches a road and is picked up by a driver who is looking for his brother Ricky, another gang member. When he exits the van to talk with Ricky, Jenny drives off, running over Paige in the process.\n\nAs Jenny makes it back to town, she crashes into a fence at a large backyard party and collapses. She awakes to find herself being comforted by a woman and her husband Jon, and soon realises she is in Brett's house. Jon notices Reece's van on his lawn as one of the other parents receives a call her of the dead gang members, who are the children of the adults at the house.\n\nA commotion begins as Jenny locks herself in the bathroom. Jon kicks the door in and is confronted by all of the party guests, as well as Brett who has returned home. Brett has convinced the adults that Jenny and Steve sadistically murdered the gang members. Jenny begs Jon to call the police and then tries ineffectually to attack him with a razor she found in the bathroom, but Jon quickly subdues her. Jon tells Brett to go upstairs, then takes Jenny back into the bathroom with two other men. Brett shuts the door of his room, blocking out her screams. He deletes the videos of the gang's crimes from Paige's phone, puts on Steve's sunglasses, and stares blankly into a mirror.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Kelly Reilly]] as Jenny Greengrass\n* [[Michael Fassbender]] as Steve Taylor\n* [[Jack O'Connell (actor)|Jack O'Connell]] as Brett\n* [[James Gandhi]] as Adam\n* [[Thomas Turgoose]] as Cooper\n* [[Bronson Webb]] as Reece\n* [[Shaun Dooley]] as Jon\n* [[Finn Atkins]] as Paige\n* [[Tom Gill (actor, born 1989)|Thomas Gill]] as Ricky\n* [[James Burrows (actor)|James Burrows]] as Harry\n* [[Mega Yoedsoel]] as Hip Hop\n}}\n\n== Production ==\n{{Empty section|date=May 2021}}\n\n==Critical reception==\nOn [[Rotten Tomatoes]], a [[review aggregator]], 80% of 28 surveyed critics gave the film a positive review; the average rating is 6.4/10.
