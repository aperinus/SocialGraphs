It is based on Stanush's 1994 book of the same name, which tells the true story of the [[Newton Gang]], a family of [[bank robbers]] from [[Uvalde, Texas]]. The film stars [[Matthew McConaughey]], who was actually born in Uvalde, [[Skeet Ulrich]], [[Ethan Hawke]], [[Vincent D'Onofrio]], and [[Dwight Yoakam]]. It was filmed throughout [[Texas]] including the towns of [[Bertram, Texas|Bertram]], [[Austin, Texas|Austin]], [[Bartlett, Texas|Bartlett]], [[New Braunfels, Texas|New Braunfels]], and [[San Antonio, Texas|San Antonio]].\n\n==Plot==\nA miscarriage of justice lands Willis Newton in prison, and he learns quickly that as a convict his only way up the social ladder is through having money. With two others, Slim and Glasscock, he carries out a bank robbery in broad daylight. Slim is caught when the three of them try to escape on horseback while the sheriff chases them in a car. Willis and Glasscock later find a bank director who buys the looted [[war bond]]s and sells them information on plenty of other banks. Henceforth, Willis and Glasscock rob banks at night and get away by car. Glasscock turns out to be an expert with [[nitroglycerin]]. Willis talks his brothers into supporting him, telling them that bankers are the worst crooks of all and thus, robbing them of their money would only mean that little thieves are stealing from big thieves. He also says that all banks are insured anyway and that the [[insurance companies]] ought to be thankful because they would not be able to sell any insurance if there were no bank robberies.\n\nThe Newton gang is very prolific, and some bankers prove to be the crooks Willis takes them for when they exaggerate their losses. Then, the insurance companies force banks to invest in enhanced safes, which can withstand nitroglycerin. Consequently, the Newton Gang goes to [[Toronto]] and ambushes a cash transport in broad daylight. Despite an elaborate plan, many things go awry, and the gang members are scarcely able to escape. Willis decides to become \"legal\", but the oil well he buys is a huge setback that costs him nearly all his money. In his despair, he goes so far as to tell his wife that God did not want him to be \"legit\". After that, he is easily lured into another criminal endeavor. He becomes very enthusiastic about a night-time [[train robbery]].{{refn|group=note|The train robbery depicted was that of the [[Milwaukee Road]]'s ''[[Fast Mail (MILW train)|Fast Mail]]'' on June 12, 1924.<ref name=PostalMuseum>{{cite web| url=https://postalmuseum.si.edu/exhibition/mail-by-rail/robberies|website=[[Smithsonian National Postal Museum]]|title=Robberies| accessdate=January 16, 2022}}</ref>}} Unfortunately, Glasscock is not as good with a gun as he was with nitroglycerin. He confuses Dock Newton with a guard, panics, and shoots him. Willis needs to bring his wounded brother to a doctor, and this undertaking eventually blows their cover.\n\nIn the end, all the Newton brothers are finally arrested and sentenced.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Matthew McConaughey]] as [[Newton Gang|Willis Newton]]\n* [[Skeet Ulrich]] as [[Newton Gang|Joe Newton]]\n* [[Ethan Hawke]] as [[Newton Gang|Jess Newton]]\n* [[Vincent D'Onofrio]] as [[Newton Gang|Wylie \"Dock\" Newton]]\n* [[Dwight Yoakam]] as [[Newton Gang|Brentwood \"Brent Glass\" Glasscock]]\n* [[Chloe Webb]] as Avis Glasscock\n* [[Gail Cronauer]] as Ma Newton\n* [[Julianna Margulies]] as Louise Brown\n* [[Anne Stedman]] as Madeline\n* [[Lew Temple]] as The Waiter\n* Charles Gunning as \"Slim\"\n* Ken Farmer as Ranger [[Frank Hamer]]\n* David Jensen as William Fahy\n* [[Bo Hopkins]] as FBI Agent K.P.
