The film was officially released at the [[2005 Toronto International Film Festival]]. The film grossed $12.1 million in the box office and debuted at #6 in its opening weekend, grossing $6 million in 1,200 theaters.\n\n==Plot==\n[[File:Broken Angel House.jpg|right|thumb|250px|The Broken Angel House, the site of the documentary, in May, 2007]]\nThe film follows Chappelle during the summer of 2004, ending on September 18, 2004, when he threw a [[block party]] on the corner of Quincy Street and Downing Street in the [[Clinton Hill, Brooklyn|Clinton Hill]] neighborhood of [[Brooklyn]], [[New York City]]. The film features nearby sites, including the [[Broken Angel House]] in Clinton Hill, Brooklyn as well as areas in [[Fort Greene, Brooklyn]] and [[Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn]]. The film was produced before Chappelle's highly publicized decision to walk away from a $50 million deal to continue his hit ''[[Chappelle's Show]]'', and gained prominence after the announcement.{{citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nChappelle invited several [[hip hop]] and [[neo-soul]] musical artists to perform at the party, including [[Kanye West]], [[Mos Def]], [[Jill Scott (singer)|Jill Scott]], [[Erykah Badu]], and [[The Roots]] along with The [[Central State University]] Marching Band. [[Lauryn Hill]] was also scheduled to perform at the party, but since [[Columbia Records]] refused to release her songs for use in the production, she decided instead to reunite [[The Fugees]] for the occasion. In addition, Chappelle performed comedy [[monologues]] and [[Sketch comedy|sketches]] in between the musical acts. Unbeknownst to the world, a young unsigned [[J. Cole]] was in the crowd watching as the legendary hip hop duo [[Black Star (rap duo)|Black Star]] performing.\n\n==Performers==\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Dave Chappelle]]\n* [[Kanye West]]\n* [[Mos Def]]\n* [[Talib Kweli]]\n* [[Jill Scott (singer)|Jill Scott]]\n* [[Erykah Badu]]\n* [[The Roots]]\n* [[Common (rapper)|Common]]\n* [[Big Daddy Kane]]\n* [[Kool G Rap]]\n* [[The Fugees]]\n* [[Bilal (musician)|Bilal]]\n* [[Dead Prez]]\n* [[Cody Chesnutt]]\n* [[John Legend]]\n* [[Central State University]] Marching Band\n* [[A-Trak]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Soundtrack==\n{{Infobox album\n| name       = Dave Chappelle's Block Party\n| type       = live\n| artist     = Various Artists\n| cover      = Blockpartysndtrk.jpg\n| alt        =\n| released   = {{start date|2006|3|14}}\n| recorded   = September 18, 2004\n| venue      =\n| studio     =\n| genre      = {{flat list|\n* [[Progressive hip hop]]\n* [[neo soul]]<ref name=\"avclub\"/>\n}}\n| length     =\n| label      = [[Geffen Records|Geffen]]\n| producer   =\n| prev_title =\n| prev_year  =\n| next_title =\n| next_year  =\n}}\n{{Album ratings\n| rev1      = [[Allmusic]]\n| rev1Score = {{Rating|4|5}} [{{AllMusic|class=album|id=r822883|pure_url=yes}} link]\n| rev2= ''[[The A.V.
