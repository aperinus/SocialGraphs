It shows how 150 British soldiers, 30 of whom were sick and wounded patients in a field hospital, successfully held off a force of 4,000 Zulu warriors.\n\nThe film was directed by American screenwriter<ref name=tcmart>{{cite web |last=Stafford |first=Jeff |url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title.jsp?stid=96684&category=Articles |title=Zulu |website=[[Turner Classic Movies]]}}</ref> [[Cy Endfield]] and produced by [[Stanley Baker]] and Endfield, with [[Joseph E. Levine]] as executive producer. The screenplay was by Endfield and historical writer [[John Prebble]], based on Prebble's 1958 ''[[Lilliput (magazine)|Lilliput]]'' article \"Slaughter in the Sun\". The film stars Baker and introduces [[Michael Caine]], in his first major role, with a supporting cast that includes [[Jack Hawkins]], [[Ulla Jacobsson]], [[James Booth]], [[Nigel Green]], [[Paul Daneman]], [[Glynn Edwards]], [[Ivor Emmanuel]], and [[Patrick Magee (actor)|Patrick Magee]]. Zulu chief and future South African political leader [[Mangosuthu Buthelezi]] played Zulu King [[Cetshwayo kaMpande]], his great-grandfather. The opening and closing narration is spoken by [[Richard Burton]].\n\nThe film was first shown on the 85th anniversary of the actual battle, 22 January 1964, at the Plaza Theatre in the [[West End of London]]. In 2017 a poll of 150 actors, directors, writers, producers, and critics for ''[[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out]]'' magazine  ranked it the 93rd best British film ever.<ref>[https://www.timeout.com/london/film/100-best-british-films#tab_panel_4 \"The 100 best British films\"]. ''[[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out]]''. Retrieved 26 October 2017</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1879, a communiqu\u00e9 from [[Frederic Thesiger, 2nd Baron Chelmsford|Lord Chelmsford]] ([[voice-over|narrated]] by [[Richard Burton]]) to the [[Secretary of State for War]] in London details the crushing defeat of a 1,300-man British column by the Zulu armies at [[Battle of Isandlwana|Isandlwana]]. In the aftermath of the battle, Zulu tribesmen are shown scavenging the battlefield and collecting [[Martini-Henry|rifles]] and ammunition from the dead soldiers. At a mass Zulu marriage ceremony witnessed by [[missionary]] Otto Witt and his daughter Margareta, Zulu King Cetshwayo is informed of the great victory; Witt and Margareta flee when they realize what has happened.\n\nA company of the British Army's [[24th Regiment of Foot]] is using Witt's missionary station at [[Battle of Rorke's Drift|Rorke's Drift]] in [[Colony of Natal|Natal]] as a supply depot and hospital for British forces in [[Zulu Kingdom|Zululand]]. Receiving news of Isandlwana from [[Natal Native Contingent]] Commander Adendorff and warnings that 4,000 Zulu warriors are advancing on their position, Lieutenant [[John Chard]] of the [[Royal Engineers]] assumes command of a force consisting of less than 200 men as he is slightly senior to their nominal commander, Lieutenant [[Gonville Bromhead]]. With not enough time to order a full evacuation, Chard decides to stay and fight. He has [[wagons]], sacks of [[Maize|mealie]] (maize), and crates of [[hardtack]] stacked to form a [[All round defence|defensive perimeter]], gun holes knocked in the hospital walls, and a medical ward set up in Witt's chapel.\n\nA contingent of South African cavalrymen who had fought at Isandlwana arrive, refuse Chard's pleas to help reinforce the station on the grounds that it is hopeless, and swiftly depart on their horses. Witt, enraged by Chard arming the hospital's patients and ordering them to fight instead of allowing them to be evacuated, persuades the Zulus serving in the Natal Native Contingent to desert. Chard then angrily orders Witt to be locked up in the chapel's supply room as he starts drinking heavily and proclaims that none of the soldiers will survive the coming battle.\n\nThe Zulu ''[[impi]]s'' approach and then charge before quickly retreating under British fire; Adendorff explains that they are trying to find weak points in the station's defenses. Chard permits Margareta to take her father away; the Zulus, recognizing Witt, allow them to pass unharmed. Chard is concerned that the northern perimeter wall is under-defended and realises that the Zulus, aware of this, are preparing to attack the station from all sides. Zulu warriors armed with British rifles also start taking potshots at the soldiers. Throughout the day and night, wave after wave of Zulu attackers are repelled, but the defenders are slowly killed off one-by-one. The Zulus succeed in setting fire to the hospital, and Private [[Henry Hook (VC)|Henry Hook]] rallies the patients to fight them and escape.\n\nThe next morning, the Zulus approach to within several hundred yards and sing a lament before launching again into their war chant; the British respond by singing the Welsh song \"[[Men of Harlech]]\". In the final assault, just as it seems the Zulus will finally overwhelm the tired defenders, the British soldiers fall back to a small [[redoubt]] in front of the chapel. With a reserve of men hidden within the redoubt, they form into three ranks and fire volley after volley, inflicting heavy casualties; the Zulus retreat. After a pause of three hours, the Zulus re-form on the [[Oscarberg]]. Resigned to another assault, the British are astonished when the Zulus instead sing a song to honour the bravery of the defenders before departing.\n\nThe film ends with another narration by Richard Burton, listing the eleven defenders who received the [[Victoria Cross]] for the defence of Rorke's Drift, the most ever awarded for a single action.\n\n==Cast==\n[[Image:Zulu Baker Caine.gif|thumb|right|upright=1.35|[[Stanley Baker]] and [[Michael Caine]]]]\n{{Listen| filename = Michael Caine BBC Radio4 Front Row 29 Sept 2010 b00tyv8c.flac|title = Michael Caine recalls auditioning for ''Zulu''|type = speech|description = from the BBC Radio 4 programme ''[[:en:Front Row (radio programme)|Front Row]]'', 29 September 2010<ref>{{Cite episode |title= Michael Caine |series= Front Row |series-link= Front Row (radio programme) |url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00tyv8c |access-date= 18 January 2014 |station=BBC Radio 4 |date=29 September 2010 }}</ref>}}\n\n* [[Stanley Baker]] as Lieutenant [[John Chard]], a veteran commander serving with the Royal Engineers.

He took it to actor Stanley Baker with whom he had made several films and who was interested in moving into production. Endfield and Prebble drafted a script, which Baker then showed to Joseph E. Levine while making ''[[Sodom and Gomorrah (1963 film)|Sodom and Gomorrah]]'' (1962) in Italy.

The mission depot at Rorke's Drift was recreated beneath the natural [[Amphitheatre (Drakensberg)|Amphitheatre]] in the [[Drakensberg|Drakensberg Mountains]] (considerably more precipitous than the real [[Rorke's Drift]], which is little more than two small hills). The set for the British field hospital and supply depot at Rorke's Drift was created near the [[Tugela River]] with the Amphitheatre in the background. The real location of the battle was 100 kilometres (60&nbsp;mi) to the northwest, on the [[Buffalo River (KwaZulu-Natal)|Buffalo River]] near the isolated hill at Isandlwana.\n\nOther scenes were filmed within the national parks of [[KwaZulu-Natal]]. Interiors and all the scenes starring James Booth were completed at [[Twickenham Film Studios]] in [[Middlesex]], England. The majority of the Zulus were real Zulus. 240 Zulu extras were employed for the battle scenes, bused in from their tribal homes over 100 miles away. Around 1,000 additional tribesmen were filmed by the second unit in [[Zululand District Municipality|Zululand]]. Eighty South African military servicemen were cast as soldiers.<ref name=\"Independent\"/>\n\nThe film was compared by Baker to a [[Western (genre)|Western movie]], with the traditional roles of the [[Cavalry (United States)|United States Cavalry]] and Native Americans taken by the British and the Zulus respectively. Director Endfield showed a Western to Zulu extras to demonstrate the concept of film acting and how he wanted the warriors to conduct themselves.<ref name=tcmart /> It has been rumoured that due to the [[Apartheid in South Africa|apartheid laws in South Africa]], none of the Zulu extras could be paid for their performance and that, consequently, Endfield circumvented this restriction by leaving them all the animals, primarily cattle, used in the film. This allegation is incorrect; no such law existed and all of the Zulu extras were paid in full \u2013 the main body of extras were paid the equivalent of nine shillings per day each, additional extras eight shillings, and the female dancers slightly less.<ref>{{cite news |first=Rupert |last=Hawksley |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/10586562/Zulu-10-things-you-didnt-know-about-the-film.html |title=Zulu: 10 things you didn't know about the film |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |date=22 January 2014 |access-date=10 June 2014}}</ref><ref name=\"Independent\">{{cite web |first=Sheldon |last=Hall |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/features/the-untold-story-of-the-film-zulu-starring-michael-caine-50-years-on-9069558.html |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20220507/https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/features/the-untold-story-of-the-film-zulu-starring-michael-caine-50-years-on-9069558.html |archive-date=7 May 2022 |url-access=subscription |url-status=live |title=The untold story of the film Zulu starring Michael Caine, 50 years on |newspaper=The Independent |date=19 January 2014 |access-date=10 June 2014}}{{cbignore}}</ref>\n\nMichael Caine, who at this early stage in his career was primarily playing bit parts, was originally up for the role of Private Henry Hook, which went to James Booth. According to Caine, he was extremely nervous during his screen test for the part of Bromhead, and director Cy Endfield told him that it was the worst screen test he had ever seen, but they were casting Caine in the part anyway because the production was leaving for South Africa shortly and they had not found anyone else for the role.<ref name=tcmart/> Caine also believed that he was fortunate that the film was directed by an American (Endfield), because \"no English director would've cast me as an officer, I promise you, not one,\" due to his Cockney roots.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/60-minutes-michael-caine-youth-lesley-stahl/ |title=Michael Caine |work=60 Minutes (television interview) |first=Lesley |last=Stahl |date=20 December 2015 |access-date=29 April 2016}}</ref> Caine later said \"My entire movie career is based on the length of the bar at the Prince of Wales theatre, because I was on my way out [after failing to get the part auditioned for] and it was a very long walk to the door.

In reality, Otto Witt was aged 30 and had a wife, Elin, and two infant children. Witt's family were {{convert|30|km}} away at the time of the battle. On the morning of the battle, Otto Witt, with the chaplain, George Smith and Surgeon-Major James Henry Reynolds had ascended Shiyane (Oscarberg), the large hill near the station, and noticed the approach of the Zulu force across the Buffalo River. Far from being a pacifist, Witt had co-operated closely with the army and negotiated a lease to put Rorke's Drift at Lord Chelmsford's disposal. Witt made it clear that he did not oppose British intervention against Cetshwayo. He had stayed at Rorke's Drift because he wished \"to take part in the defence of my own house and at the same time in the defence of an important place for the whole colony, yet my thoughts went to my wife and to my children, who were at a short distance from there, and did not know anything of what was going on\". He therefore left on horseback to join his family shortly before the battle.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://samilitaryhistory.org/vol104fh.html |title=The Defeat of History in the film Zulu |first=Frederick |last=Hale |journal=Military History Journal |volume=10 |number=4 |date=December 1996 |publisher=The South African Military History Society/Die Suid-Afrikaanse Krygshistoriese Vereniging |access-date=12 May 2016}}</ref>\n\n===The men of the regiment===\n* Lieutenants John Chard and Gonville Bromhead: Chard had received his commission in February 1868, making Bromhead the junior officer and second-in-command at the Drift even though he was an infantryman and Chard was an engineer.

They were present during the opening action with the Zulus, but then rode off as they had very little ammunition for their cavalry carbines. Captain Stephenson is depicted at their head; in reality he was leading the NNC infantry, who had already deserted.\n* The uniforms of the Natal Native Contingent are inaccurate: NNC troops were not issued with European-style clothes.  Only their European officers wore makeshift uniforms. The rank and file wore traditional tribal garb topped by a red rag worn around the forehead (as correctly depicted in the prequel ''[[Zulu Dawn]]''). The story of their desertion is true.

Stephenson was later convicted of [[desertion]] at a [[court-martial]] and dismissed from the army.\n\n===The Zulus===\nThe attack on the mission station was not ordered by King Cetshwayo, as the audience is led to believe in the film. Cetshwayo had specifically told his warriors not to invade Natal, the British Colony. The attack was led by Prince [[Dabulamanzi kaMpande]], the King's half-brother, who pursued fleeing survivors at Isandlwana across the river and then moved on to attack Rorke's Drift. Although almost 20,000 rounds of ammunition were fired by the defenders, just under 400 Zulus were killed at Rorke's Drift. A similar number were left behind when the Zulus retreated, being too badly wounded to move. Comments from veterans many years after the event suggest the British killed many of these wounded men in the battle's aftermath, raising the total number of Zulu deaths to over 700.\n\n===Ending===\nAt roughly 7:00&nbsp;a.m., an Impi appeared prompting the British to man their positions again. No attack materialised, as the Zulus had been on the move for six days prior to the battle. In their ranks were hundreds of wounded, and moreover they were several days' march from any supplies.\n\nAround 8:00am, another force appeared, the defenders abandoned their breakfast and took up their positions again. The approaching troops were the vanguard of Lord Chelmsford's relief column.\n\nThe Zulus did not sing a song saluting fellow warriors, and departed at the approach of the British relief column.<ref name=\"Rorke's Drift vc.com myths\"/><ref name=\"BBC News site\"/> This inaccuracy has been praised for showing the Zulus in a positive light and for treating them and the British as equals, but it has also been criticised as undermining any anti-imperial message of the film.<ref name=Dovey2009a/>\n\n==Reception==\nOn its initial release in 1964, it was one of the biggest box-office hits of all time in the British market. For the next 12 years it remained in constant cinema circulation before making its first appearance on television. It then went on to become a television perennial, and remains beloved by the British public.<ref name=\"Independent\"/>\n\n''Zulu'' received highly positive reviews from critics. [[Bosley Crowther]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote that \"if you're not too squeamish at the sight of slaughter and blood and can keep your mind fixed on the notion that there was something heroic and strong about British colonial expansion in the 19th century, you may find a great deal of excitement in this robustly [[Rudyard Kipling|Kiplingesque]] film.

This final scene, however, is not historically accurate. ...

In the UK however, the only 70mm screening was a press show prior to release. While the vast majority of cinemas would have played the film in 35mm anyway, the Plaza's West End screenings were of the 35mm anamorphic version as well rather than, as might have been expected, a 70mm print. This was due to the UK's [[Cinematograph Films Act 1927|film quota regulations]], which demanded that cinemas showed 30% British films during the calendar year, but the regulations only applied to 35mm presentations. By 1964, the number of British films available to a cinema like the Plaza could be limited and ''Zulu'' gave them several weeks of British quota qualification if played in 35mm. In other countries the public did get to see the film in 70mm.\n\n==Awards and honours==\n{{Anchor|Awards|Accolades}}\nErnest Archer was nominated for a [[British Academy Film Awards|BAFTA Award]] for [[BAFTA Award for Best Production Design|Best Colour Art Direction]] on the film.<ref name=tcmart/> The magazine ''[[Total Film]]'' (2004) ranked ''Zulu'' the 37th greatest British movie of all time, and it was ranked eighth in the British television programme ''The 100 Greatest War Films''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.channel4.com/film/newsfeatures/microsites/W/greatest_warfilms/results/10-6.html |title=100 Greatest War Films : 10 to 6 |website=Film4 |access-date=12 May 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327194935/http://www.channel4.com/film/newsfeatures/microsites/W/greatest_warfilms/results/10-6.html |archive-date=27 March 2009}}</ref> ''[[Empire (film magazine)|Empire]]'' magazine ranked ''Zulu'' 351st on their list of the 500 greatest films.\n\n==Home video releases==\nIn the US, a [[LaserDisc]] release by [[The Criterion Collection]] retains the original stereophonic soundtrack taken from a 70mm print.\n\nAn official DVD release (with a mono soundtrack as the original stereo tracks were not available) was later issued by [[StudioCanal]] through [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]].
