The sequel to the 1995 film ''[[Bad Boys (1995 film)|Bad Boys]]'' and the second film in the [[Bad Boys (franchise)|''Bad Boys'' film series]], the film follows detectives Burnett and Lowrey investigating the flow of [[illegal drugs]] going into [[Miami]].\n\n''Bad Boys II'' was released on July 18, 2003. It received extremely negative reviews from critics and grossed $273 million worldwide. A third film, ''[[Bad Boys for Life]]'', was released in January 2020.\n\n==Plot==\nEight years after the events of the first film, Mike and Marcus are investigating the flow of [[MDMA|ecstasy]] into [[Miami]]. They infiltrate a [[Ku Klux Klan|Klan]] meeting held in the marshland outside of Miami only to discover that they are, in fact, buyers and not distributors of the ecstasy. After a radio mishap leads to a delayed arrival of Miami Police\u2019s Tactical Narcotics Team (TNT), Mike and Marcus end up in a shootout with the Klansmen that results in many casualties and injuries, with Marcus accidentally sustaining a gunshot wound to the buttocks from Mike.\n\nThese antics lead Marcus to re-evaluate whether he wants to remain partners with Mike, who is secretly dating Syd, Marcus\u2019 younger sister. Unbeknownst to both Marcus and Mike, Syd is working undercover for the [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] (DEA) as a [[Money laundering|money launderer]] to a branch of the Russian Mafia operating in Miami\u2019s drug trade. The Russians, in turn, are the main distributors of ecstasy for Cuban drug lord Hector Juan Carlos \u201cJohnny\u201d Tapia. After laundering a large sum of money for the Russians, Syd is intercepted by [[Haiti]]an gang [[Zoe Pound]] while she is transporting the money. Mike and Marcus, working on a tip from an informant, had been following the Haitians when the latter made their move, leading to an extensive gun battle and car chase through Miami that resulted in significant collateral damage and loss of life as well as the angry reprimand of Mike and Marcus by Captain Howard, who was further angered to find out the DEA was running an investigation in Miami without consulting him first.\n\nMike and Marcus then track down the surviving Haitians, and after another gun battle inside the leader\u2019s house, they interrogate the leader and learn from one of the Haitian\u2019s video camera that Tapia is using a local mortuary as a front for his operations. To gain more intel Mike and Marcus pose as pest exterminators responding to a rat infestation of Tapia\u2019s Miami residence. They use the cover to gain access to the mansion and plant bugs throughout the premises. Meanwhile, Tapia has had a meeting with his Russian business associates Alexei and Josef. While he discusses his business with Alexei, Tapia has Josef butchered in his kitchen and places the remains in a tortilla bin as a threat to Alexei to sign over all of his Miami night clubs where he distributes ecstasy. Mike discovers some of Josef\u2019s remains in the kitchen where he was dismembered, smuggling a pinky finger for later identification. With the Russians removed from the equation, Tapia begins a mixed business-personal relationship with Syd wherein he intends for her to launder all of the money for his operation.\n\nLater, Mike and Marcus infiltrate Tapia\u2019s mortuary. Inside they discover that Tapia is using cadavers and coffins to smuggle drugs and money in and out of the country. However, Marcus swallows two ecstasy pills by accident and ends up high in the process. They are almost discovered but two other officers crash into the building, allowing Mike and Marcus to escape. The evidence is sufficient for Captain Howard to authorize a raid on both Tapia\u2019s residence and the mortuary in collaboration with the DEA and the [[United States Coast Guard|U.S. Coast Guard]]. Nearly all of Tapia\u2019s drug supply and money are confiscated in the raid, though Tapia flees to [[Cuba]] with Syd as a hostage before he can be apprehended. Using her as a bargaining chip, Tapia demands the return of his money from Miami PD. Knowing that\u2019s impossible, Mike and Marcus arrange a covert operation to rescue Syd, forming an unofficial task force with agents from the DEA, TNT, and Captain Howard\u2019s contacts from the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]].\n\nThe team is inserted by the Coast Guard a few miles off the coast of Cuba, where they rendezvous with a fellow officer\u2019s brother, Tito, who is head of the underground resistance in Cuba. There, Tito assists the teams with weapons, a tunnel network, and an accurate mapping of Tapia\u2019s new mansion.\n\nThe team infiltrates Tapia\u2019s mansion, rescues Syd, and leaves a large explosive device that demolishes the mansion upon the team\u2019s exfiltration. Tapia survives, and pursues Mike, Marcus, Syd and Tito through the countryside and the village of hillside shacks where cocaine is processed, ultimately ending up outside of [[Guantanamo Bay Naval Base|Guantanamo Bay]]. Not recognized as U.S. Citizens, the [[United States Navy|Navy]] personnel on the base shoot at both Mike and Marcus as well as Tapia\u2019s vehicles, prompting them to stop just as they enter in a live minefield. With only a couple of rounds remaining in their weapons, Marcus manages to shoot Tapia in the head while the latter holds Mike at gunpoint. Tapia falls backward onto a mine which obliterates his corpse.\n\nLater, Mike, Marcus, and Syd celebrate at a barbecue in Marcus\u2019 backyard with his family; Marcus has decided to remain partners with Mike.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Martin Lawrence]] as Detective Lieutenant Marcus Miles Burnett\n* [[Will Smith]] as Detective Lieutenant Michael Eugene 'Mike' Lowrey\n* [[Jordi Moll\u00e0]] as Hector Juan Carlos 'Johnny' Tapia\n* [[Gabrielle Union]] as [[Drug Enforcement Administration|DEA]] Special Agent Sydney 'Syd' Burnett\n* [[Peter Stormare]] as Alexei\n* [[Theresa Randle]] as Theresa Burnett\n* [[Joe Pantoliano]] as Captain Conrad Howard\n* [[Otto Sanchez]] as Carlos\n* [[Jon Seda]] as Roberto\n* [[Oleg Taktarov]] as Josef Kuninskavich\n* [[Michael Shannon]] as Floyd Poteet\n* [[Jason Manuel Olazabal]] as Detective Marco Vargas\n* [[Yul Vazquez]] as Detective Mateo Reyes\n* [[Treva Etienne]] as 'Icepick'\n* Kiko Ellsworth as 'Blondie Dread'\n* [[Timothy Adams (actor)|Timothy Adams]] as [[Drug Enforcement Administration|DEA]] van agent\n* [[Henry Rollins]] as TNT leader\n* [[Ivelin Giro]] as Mike's police psychologist \n* Dennis Greene as Reggie McDonald\n* [[John Salley]] as Fletcher\n* [[Dan Marino]] as Himself\n* [[Megan Fox]] as Dancer (uncredited)\n}}\n\n==Music==\n{{Main|Bad Boys II (soundtrack)}}\n\n==Reception==\n===Critical response===\nOn [[Rotten Tomatoes]], ''Bad Boys II'' holds an approval rating 23% based on 183 reviews, and a weighted average of 4.08/10.
