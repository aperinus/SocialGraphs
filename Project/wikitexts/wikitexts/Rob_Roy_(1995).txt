[[Jessica Lange]], [[John Hurt]], [[Tim Roth]], [[Eric Stoltz]], [[Brian Cox (actor)|Brian Cox]], and [[Jason Flemyng]] also star. Roth won the [[BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role]] and was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor]] for his portrayal of the aristocrat Archibald Cunningham.\n\nThe film is dedicated to two Scotsmen: film director [[Alexander MacKendrick]] and [[association football|football]] player and [[manager (association football)|manager]] [[Jock Stein]].\n\n==Plot==\nIn Scotland, 1714, [[Robert Roy MacGregor]] is Chief of [[Clan Gregor|Clan MacGregor]]. Although providing the Lowland gentry with protection against [[cattle rustling]], he barely manages to feed his people. Hoping to alleviate their and his poverty, MacGregor borrows \u00a31,000 from [[James Graham, 1st Duke of Montrose|James Graham, Marquess of Montrose]], to establish himself as a cattle raiser and trader.\n\nWanting to leave England to flee legal troubles, his anglicized aristocrat relative Archibald Cunningham is sent to stay with Montrose. Montrose makes money off Cunningham by making wagers on sword contests that Cunningham's haughty manner and effeminate bearing bring upon himself. However, Cunningham is supremely skilled with a sword. Cunningham learns about MacGregor's money deal from Montrose's [[Factor (Scotland)|factor]] Killearn, and murders MacGregor's friend, Alan McDonald, to steal the money. MacGregor requests time from Montrose to find McDonald and the money. Montrose offers to waive the debt if MacGregor will testify falsely that Montrose's rival [[John Campbell, 2nd Duke of Argyll]] is a [[Jacobitism|Jacobite]]. MacGregor refuses and Montrose vows to imprison him in the [[tolbooth]] until the debt is repaid. After MacGregor flees, Montrose seizes MacGregor's land to cover the debt, declaring him an outlaw and ordering Cunningham to bring him in \"broken, but not dead\". [[redcoat (British army)|Redcoats]] slaughter MacGregor's cattle, burn his croft, and Cunningham rapes his wife Mary.\n\nMary understands that Cunningham intends to flush her husband out of hiding and makes his brother, Alasdair, who arrives too late to save her, swear to conceal knowledge of the rape. MacGregor refuses to permit his clan to wage war on Montrose. Instead, he decrees, \"The tenderest part of the marquess is his purse. We'll hurt him there. Thieve his cattle, steal his rents.\" Betty, a maidservant at Montrose's estate, has become pregnant with Cunningham's child. When Killearn tells Montrose, Betty is dismissed from service and rejected by Cunningham. Betty seeks refuge with the MacGregors, revealing that she overheard Killearn and Cunningham plot to steal the money. To build a case against Cunningham, MacGregor abducts Killearn and imprisons him. Mary promises Killearn that he will be spared if he testifies against Cunningham, but Killearn taunts her with her rape. Realizing that Mary is pregnant, he threatens to tell MacGregor that Cunningham may be the father if she does not release him, leading Mary and Alasdair to kill him.\n\nMontrose tells Cunningham that he suspects who really stole the money but does not care. Cunningham and the redcoats burn the Clan's crofts. MacGregor refuses to take the bait, but Alasdair attempts to snipe Cunningham and hits a redcoat. The redcoats shoot both Alasdair and another Clan member, Coll. Alasdair finally tells MacGregor about Mary's rape. Taken prisoner, MacGregor accuses Cunningham of murder, robbery and rape. Cunningham confirms the charges, and beats and tortures Rob. The following morning, Montrose orders MacGregor hanged from a nearby bridge. MacGregor loops the rope binding his hands around Cunningham's throat and then jumps off the bridge. To save Cunningham, Montrose orders the rope cut. \n\nMary gains an audience with the Duke of Argyll and exposes Montrose's plan to frame him. Moved by MacGregor's integrity, he grants the family asylum at [[Glen Shira]]. MacGregor arrives, at first upset by Mary's unwillingness to inform him of her rape or her pregnancy but later willing to raise the child as his own. The Duke arranges a duel between MacGregor and Cunningham, wagering Montrose that if MacGregor lives, his debt will be forgiven and that if he dies, the Duke will pay his debt. Montrose agrees and Cunningham and MacGregor vow that [[no quarter]] will be asked or given. Armed with a [[rapier]], Cunningham repeatedly wounds MacGregor, who appears to swiftly exhaust himself swinging a heavy [[Basket-hilted sword|broadsword]]. MacGregor seems defeated, but when Cunningham showboats to deliver a theatrical killing blow, MacGregor holds on to his enemy's sword-point with his left hand. As Cunningham struggles to free his blade, MacGregor delivers a fatal strike to Cunningham. Now free of debts and with his honor intact, he returns home to his wife and children.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Liam Neeson]] as [[Rob Roy MacGregor]]\n* [[Jessica Lange]] as Mary MacGregor\n* [[John Hurt]] as [[James Graham, 1st Duke of Montrose|James Graham, 4th Marquess of Montrose]]\n* [[Tim Roth]] as Archibald Cunningham\n* [[Eric Stoltz]] as Alan McDonald\n* [[Andrew Keir]] as [[John Campbell, 2nd Duke of Argyll]]\n* [[Brian Cox (actor)|Brian Cox]] as Killearn\n* [[Brian McCardie]] as Alasdair MacGregor\n* Gilbert Martin as Guthrie, the Duke of Argyll's fencing champion\n* [[Jason Flemyng]] as Gregor, a MacGregor Clan retainer\n* [[Ewan Stewart]] as Coll, a MacGregor Clan retainer\n* [[David Hayman]] as Tam Sibbalt, a [[Scottish Traveller]] who has been rustling from cattle herds under MacGregor's protection\n* [[Shirley Henderson]] as Morag\n\n==Production==\nAccording to screenwriter Alan Sharp, Rob Roy was conceived as a [[Western (genre)|Western]] set in the Scottish Highlands.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Minsaas|first1=Kirsti|title=Rob Roy: The Value of Honor|url=http://www.theatlasphere.com/columns/121008-minsaas-robroy.php|access-date=25 September 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe film was shot entirely on location in [[Scotland]], much of it in parts of the [[Scottish Highlands|Highlands]] so remote they had to be reached by helicopter.

The critic applauded Tim Roth's performance, calling it \"crucial\" to the film's success. Ebert was also impressed by the climactic sword fighting scene and called it \"one of the great action sequences in movie history\".<ref>{{cite news | last=Ebert | first=Roger | author-link=Roger Ebert | url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/rob-roy-1995 | title=Rob Roy | work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]] | date=April 7, 1995 }}</ref> His partner Gene Siskel agreed, calling it the \"best sword fight in motion picture history.\"<ref>{{Citation |title=Siskel & Ebert Collection on Letterman, Part 5 of 6: 1995-96 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqdbJwo8qgI |language=en |access-date=2022-10-27}}</ref>\n\nIn contrast, Rita Kempley of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' compared ''Rob Roy'' negatively to the action films ''[[Death Wish (1974 film)|Death Wish]]'' (1974) and ''[[First Blood]]'' (1982). Kempley disliked the film's violence and wrote, \"Frankly, Rob Roy is about as bright as one of his cows. He doesn't even recognize that his obsession with honor will lead to the destruction of his clan.\" The critic found the protagonist unheroic in his mission for vengeance. Of his enemy, she said, \"The villains, played with glee, manage to perk up the glacial pace, but they too grow tiresome.\"<ref>{{cite news | last=Kempley | first=Rita | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/style/longterm/movies/videos/robroyrkempley_c01060.htm | title='Rob Roy' (R) | newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] | date=April 7, 1995 }}</ref>\n\nIn ''[[The New York Times]]'', [[Janet Maslin]] gave a mixed review of the film. She complained of the film's \"long, dry stretches\" and that the \"plot [was] too ponderous and uninteresting for the film's visual sweep\". Maslin said one of the film's saving graces was the \"robust\" presence of Liam Neeson, taller than those who played his enemies, and his character's charismatic exchange with Jessica Lange's character, writing, \"''Rob Roy'' is best watched for local color and for its hearty, hot-blooded stars.\" Maslin acknowledged that Neeson was \"a far cry from the dour-looking Scottish drover who was the real Rob Roy\" and said that the film failed to convey the figure's importance to audiences. The critic highlighted the scene of Cunningham raping Mary as one of the film's \"strongest scenes\" which was appropriately responded to by the \"cowboy justice\" of Neeson's lonesome and avenging Rob Roy.<ref>{{cite news | last=Maslin | first=Janet | author-link=Janet Maslin | url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=990CE6D8113AF934A35757C0A963958260 | title=Film Review: Rob Roy; Liam Neeson: Man in Kilts | work=[[The New York Times]] | date=April 7, 1995 }}</ref>\n\n==Accolades==\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
