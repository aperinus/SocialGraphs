Directed by [[Claude Berri]], it is the second of two films adapted from the 1966 two-volume novel by [[Marcel Pagnol]], who wrote it based on his own earlier film of the same title. It is the sequel to ''[[Jean de Florette]]''.<ref>[https://siskelebert.org/?p=4424 The Duxorcist, Walker, Manon of the Spring, The Dead, Happy New Year, 1987 \u2013 Siskel and Ebert Movie Reviews]</ref><ref>[https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/manon-of-the-spring-1987 Roger Ebert]</ref><ref>[https://www.spiritualityandpractice.com/films/reviews/view/9036 Spirituality & Practice]</ref>\n\n''[[Jean de Florette]]'' and ''Manon des Sources'' are ranked No. 60 in ''[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]'' magazine's \"The 100 Best Films of World Cinema\" in 2010.<ref>{{cite web \n| title = The 100 Best Films Of World Cinema \u2013 60.

She has taken up residence with an elderly [[Piedmont]]ese [[squatter]] couple who teach her to live off the land, tending to a herd of goats and hunting for [[bird]]s and [[rabbit]]s.  Ugolin Soubeyran, also called Galinette (only by his uncle C\u00e9sar), has begun a successful business growing [[carnation]]s at Les Romarins with his uncle, C\u00e9sar Soubeyran\u2014also known as Papet\u2014thanks to the water provided by the [[Spring (hydrosphere)|spring]] there.\n\nAfter seeing her bathe nude in the mountains, Ugolin develops an interest in Manon. When he approaches her, she seems disgusted by his vileness and almost certainly by the memory of his involvement in her father's downfall. But Ugolin's interest in Manon becomes obsessive, culminating in sewing a ribbon from her hair onto his chest. At the same time, Manon becomes interested in Bernard, a handsome and educated schoolteacher recently arrived in the village. As a small child, Manon had suffered the loss of her father, who died from a blow to the head while using explosives in an attempt to find a water source. C\u00e9sar and Ugolin then bought the farm cheaply from his widow\u2014Manon's mother\u2014and unblocked the spring. Manon witnessed this as a child. The two men profited directly from his death.\n\nWhen she overhears two villagers talking about it, Manon realises that many in the village knew of the crime but had remained silent, for the Soubeyran family was locally important. While searching for a goat that fell into a crevice above the village, Manon finds the underground [[Source (river or stream)|source]] of the spring that supplies water to the local farms and village. To take her revenge on both the Soubeyrans and the villagers, who knew but did nothing, she stops the flow of water using the iron-oxide clay and rocks found nearby.\n\nThe villagers quickly become desperate for water to feed their crops and run their businesses. They come to believe that the water flow had been stopped by some Providence to punish the injustice committed against Jean. Manon publicly accuses C\u00e9sar and Ugolin, and the villagers  admit their own complicity in the persecution of Jean. They had never accepted him, as he was an outsider and was physically deformed. C\u00e9sar tries to evade the accusations, but an eyewitness, a poacher who was trespassing on the vacant property at the time, steps forward to confirm the crime, shaming both C\u00e9sar and Ugolin. Ugolin makes a desperate attempt to ask Manon for her hand in marriage, but she rejects him. The Soubeyrans flee in disgrace. Rejected by Manon, Ugolin commits [[suicide]] by hanging himself from a tree, apparently ending the Soubeyran line.\n\nThe villagers appeal to Manon to take part in a religious procession to the village's fountain because she is orphaned, hoping that acknowledging the injustice will restore the flow of water to the village. With the assistance of Bernard, Manon unblocks the spring in advance, and the water arrives at the village at the moment that the procession reaches the fountain. Manon marries Bernard.\n\nMeanwhile, C\u00e9sar has been broken by his nephew's suicide. Delphine, an old acquaintance of his, returns to the village and tells him that Florette, his sweetheart from that period, had written to him to tell him she was carrying their child. Receiving no reply from him, she had tried to abort it. Florette left the village, married a blacksmith from nearby Cr\u00e9spin, and the child was born alive but a hunchback.\n\nC\u00e9sar, away on military service in Africa, never received her letter and did not know that she had given birth to his child.  In a cruel twist of fate, Jean, the man he drove to desperation and death without having met him, was the son he had always wanted. Realizing now she is related to him, C\u00e9sar sadly watches a pregnant Manon hurry home at night, wishing to reconcile with his only grandchild, but knowing it will never happen.\n\nDevastated, and lacking the will to live any longer, C\u00e9sar dies quietly in his sleep. In a letter he leaves his property to Manon, whom he recognises as his natural granddaughter and the last of the Soubeyrans.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Emmanuelle B\u00e9art]] as Manon\n* [[Yves Montand]] as C\u00e9sar Soubeyran/'Le Papet'\n* [[Daniel Auteuil]] as Ugolin\n* [[Hippolyte Girardot]] as Bernard Olivier\n* [[Margarita Lozano]] as Baptistine\n* Yvonne Gamy as Delphine\n* [[Gabriel Bacquier]] and [[\u00c8ve Brenner]] as singers at the wedding\n\n==Production==\nThe sequence in which Manon bathes naked posed some difficulties.
