It stars [[Lorenza Izzo]], [[Ariel Levy (actor)|Ariel Levy]], [[Daryl Sabara]], [[Kirby Bliss Blanton]], [[Sky Ferreira]], [[Magda Apanowicz]], Nicol\u00e1s Martinez, [[Aaron Burns]], [[Ignacia Allamand]], Ram\u00f3n Llao, and [[Richard Burgi]]. The film follows a young woman who joins an activist group that go on an overseas trip, where they eventually run into a cannibalistic tribe.\n\nThe movie was inspired by and serves as an homage to [[Italian cinema|Italian]] [[cannibal film]]s of the late 1970s and early '80s \"[[cannibal boom]]\", particularly ''[[Cannibal Holocaust]]'' (1980), which features a [[Story within a story#Film within a film|film-within-a-film]] titled ''The Green Inferno''.\n\n''The Green Inferno'' premiered at the [[2013 Toronto International Film Festival]] on September 8, 2013, and was theatrically released on September 25, 2015, by [[High Top Releasing]] and [[BH Tilt]]. The film earned $12.9 million on a budget of $5 million, and received negative reviews from critics.\n\n==Plot==\nCollege freshman Justine becomes interested in a student [[social activism]] group led by Alejandro and his girlfriend Kara. The group plans a trip to the [[Amazon rainforest]] to stop a [[Petrochemical industry|petrochemical]] company from forest clearing and displacing native tribes by filming them and streaming footage to raise awareness. Justine suggests she could bring attention to the issue through her father, a [[United Nations]] attorney.\n\nThe operation is funded by Carlos, a [[drug dealer]] who meets the group in [[Peru]]. They journey by boat to the construction site and begin their protest, chaining themselves to bulldozers while filming the land clearing. A [[Private military company|private militia]] hired by the company arrives, and when Justine is nearly killed by an officer, the protest goes viral. The group is arrested, but Carlos bribes the police to release them. They depart by plane, but the plane's engine explodes and it crashes in the jungle, killing several people, including Carlos.\n\nAs the survivors search for a [[GPS phone]], Kara hears something nearby. However, when she goes to check, a native tribe emerges and kills her with an arrow before tranquilizing the others, taking them to their village, and imprisoning them. As a tribal elder and the Headhunter leader kill Jonah and feed his remains to their tribe, Alejandro reveals the protest was staged to benefit a rival petrochemical company and so he could focus on other activism projects, to the others' dismay. The tribe test Justine, Amy, and Samantha for their [[virginity]]. Upon learning Justine is a virgin, they take her away for a [[genital mutilation]] ceremony while the other two women are returned. Alejandro tells the group to stay put and wait for the next petrochemical company's clearing crews, but they attempt to escape. Amidst a downpour, they distract a watchman while Samantha escapes and hides in a canoe and Justine is returned but does not remember anything from her ordeal.\n\nThe tribe feed the prisoners strange meat. Being a vegan, Amy reluctantly eats, only to discover a chunk of skin in her bowl bearing one of Samantha's tattoos. Realizing they were fed Samantha's remains, Amy breaks the bowl and uses a shard to commit suicide. Seeing an opportunity, Lars stuffs [[marijuana]] down Amy's throat, hoping to get the tribe high when they eat her. As his plan succeeds, Justine and Daniel escape, but Alejandro chooses to stay, tranquilizing Lars to keep him company. When Lars regains consciousness, the intoxicated tribe members eat him alive.\n\nJustine and Daniel reach the crash site and find a phone, but are recaptured and returned to the village. The tribe paints and dresses Justine in tribal attire while an elder ties Daniel to a stake, breaks his limbs, and leaves him to be eaten by ants. News of a forest clearing crew's arrival sends the tribe into a frenzy and the warriors leave to confront them, allowing Justine to escape with the help of a sympathetic child she befriended earlier. Daniel begs Justine to kill him, but the child does so after she refuses. Alejandro begs Justine for help, but she abandons him and flees. Encountering the militia in a firefight against the tribe, in which the Headhunter and most of the tribe\u2019s warriors are killed, she convinces an officer that she is an American and uses the phone to pretend to film the fight so the battle would end peacefully, and they fly her to safety.\n\nIn [[New York City]], she lies to her father and other government workers in an interview saying that she was the sole survivor of the plane crash, the natives were friendly, and that they helped her group before they were slaughtered by the petrochemical company's militia. Sometime later, Justine sees a group of activists wearing shirts emblazoned with Alejandro's face.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Lorenza Izzo]] as Justine, a college freshman \n* [[Ariel Levy (actor)|Ariel Levy]] as Alejandro,<ref name=Cast>{{cite news|title=Full Cast Announced for Eli Roth's The Green Inferno|url=https://comingsoon.net/news/movienews.php?id=96382|access-date=August 4, 2013|newspaper=comingsoon.net|date=October 25, 2012}}</ref> leader of an activism group\n* [[Daryl Sabara]] as Lars\n* [[Kirby Bliss Blanton]] as Amy<ref name=\"Cast\" />\n* [[Magda Apanowicz]] as Samantha<ref name=\"Cast\" />\n* [[Sky Ferreira]] as Kaycee,<ref name=\"Cast\" /> Justine's roommate\n* Nicol\u00e1s Mart\u00ednez as Daniel, one of the college students who goes to Peru with Justine and Alejandro\n* [[Aaron Burns]] as Jonah<ref name=\"Cast\" />\n* [[Ignacia Allamand]] as Kara, Alejandro's girlfriend\n* Ram\u00f3n Llao as The Bald Headhunter, the cannibalistic leader of the Peruvian tribe\n* [[Richard Burgi]] as Charles, Justine's Father\n* Mat\u00edas L\u00f3pez as Carlos Lincones\n* Antonieta Pari as The Village Elder, the matriarch of the Peruvian tribe\n* Percy Chumbe as Guard Leader, the unnamed leader of the logging company's hired militia tasked with destroying the forests\n* [[Paz Bascu\u00f1\u00e1n]] as Lucia (voice)\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\nOn May 17, 2012, at the [[2012 Cannes Film Festival]], [[Eli Roth]] announced that he was planning to direct a horror thriller, ''The Green Inferno'', with [[Worldview Entertainment]] stating that they would finance and produce the film.<ref name=Eli>{{cite news|title=Worldview Financing Thriller 'The Green Inferno' Directed by Eli Roth|url=http://www.firstshowing.net/2012/worldview-financing-thriller-the-green-inferno-directed-by-eli-roth/|access-date=August 4, 2013|newspaper=firstshowing.net|date=May 17, 2012}}</ref> Roth wrote the script with Guillermo Amoedo.<ref>{{cite news|title=Eli Roth Aims to Make Horror Thriller 'The Green Inferno' His 'Scariest and Most Intense Film'|url=https://indiewire.com/article/eli-roth-aims-to-make-horror-thriller-the-green-inferno-his-scariest-and-most-intense-film|access-date=4 August 2013|newspaper=indiewire.com|date=May 17, 2012}}</ref> Production began in Autumn 2012 in Peru and Chile.<ref>{{cite news|title=Eli Roth returns to directing with horror thriller 'The Green Inferno'|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/movies/news/a382146/eli-roth-returns-to-directing-with-horror-thriller-the-green-inferno.html|access-date=August 4, 2013|newspaper=digitalspy.co.uk|date=17 May 2012}}</ref> In October 2012, it was announced that filming was set to begin in November in Peru.<ref name=peru>{{cite news|title=Eli Roth Borrows Werner Herzog's Tactics to Shoot Cannibal Movie 'The Green Inferno'|url=http://www.slashfilm.com/eli-roth-borrows-werner-herzogs-tactics-to-shoot-cannibal-movie-the-green-inferno/|access-date=August 4, 2013|newspaper=slashfilm.com|date=October 25, 2012}}</ref> On October 25, Roth announced the full cast for the film.<ref>{{cite news|title=Eli Roth's 'Green Inferno' full cast announced|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/movies/news/a433621/eli-roths-green-inferno-full-cast-announced.html|access-date=August 4, 2013|newspaper=digitalspy.co.uk|date=October 26, 2012}}</ref> [[Principal photography]] began in October 2012 in [[New York City]], and shooting in Peru and in some locations in Chile began on November 5, 2012.<ref name=\"peru\"/>\n\nRoth said in an interview in February 2013 that he wanted the film to look like a [[Werner Herzog]] or [[Terrence Malick]] film.

They can window-dress things however they like, but nobody will destroy a village because they didn't like a character in a movie, they'll do it because they want to get rich by draining what's under the village.
