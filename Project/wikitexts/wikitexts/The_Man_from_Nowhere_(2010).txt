His only friend is a little girl, So-mi, who lives in the same neighborhood. So-mi's mother, Hyo-jeong, is a [[Go-go dancing|go-go dancer]] and opium addict. Instructed by her lover, Hyo-jeong steals a large pack of [[opium]] being sold at the bar where she works and hides it in a camera bag, which she pawns to Tae-sik for safe keeping. Hyo-jeong's action attracts the attention of crime lord Oh Myung-gyu, who tasks his [[subordinates]], brothers Man-seok and Jong-seok, to retrieve the opium. Jong-seok locates Hyo-jeong, tortures her in front of So-mi, and forces her to reveal where the drugs are. His [[wikt:lackey|lackeys]], Du-chi and Bear, go to Tae-sik's place to intimidate him, but he easily overpowers them.\n\nRealizing Tae-sik has a soft spot for So-mi, Jong-seok kidnaps her and forces him to deliver opium to Oh Myung-gyu. Man-seok informs the police, leading to them [[surrounding|swarming]] Myung-gyu's property. Myung-gyu escapes, while Tae-sik is arrested and discovers Hyo-jeong's body, with her [[organs]] harvested, in the back of the car he used to make the delivery. Tae-sik escapes from the [[police station]], alarming them with his display of [[combat|combat skills]]. Upon further investigation, the police officers discover he was a former [[covert operative]] for the [[South Korean Army]] Intelligence, with numerous commendations, but retired after he was wounded and his pregnant wife was killed by a hitman.\n\nFollowing the lead from the burner phone he received from Jong-seok, Tae-sik tracks Du-chi to a nightclub. As he asks where the brothers are, Ramrowan walks in and shoots at Tae-sik, killing Du-chi in the crossfire. The two fight to a standstill and Tae-sik gets shot. \nBleeding out, Tae-sik finds his former partner, who performs emergency surgery to remove the bullet. Tae-sik recovers, asks his partner to help him acquire a gun, then goes back to the city. Tae-sik finds and frees several child slaves in a drug manufacturing plant, in the process killing off Jong-seok. He tracks down the elder brother, Man-seok, at the gang's [[condo]], where a dozen gang members and Ramrowan are also waiting. Man-seok says that he has had So-mi killed and shows Tae-sik a [[container]] that has what he says are her eyes.  He demands to know what happened to his younger brother.\n\nEnraged, Tae-sik kills the gang members, including Ramrowan and Man-seok. As Tae-sik prepares to commit suicide out of grief a scared, dirty, but unscathed So-mi emerges from the darkness; she'd been saved by Ramrowan, who took pity on her because she had been kind to him - the [[eyes]] in the container belonged to the gangsters' [[surgeon]], who had been killed off-camera by Ramrowan. The police allow Tae-sik and So-mi to ride together after Tae-sik's arrest, While she sleeps. Tae-sik asks them to drop at a small [[convenience store]] where he buys a backpack along with other school supplies.  He tells So-mi that she's going to be on her own, as the police have to take him away. Before he goes, he asks her for a hug and breaks down in tears as they embrace.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=}}\n*[[Won Bin]] as Cha Tae-sik\n*[[Kim Sae-ron]] as So-mi\n*[[Kim Hee-won]] as Man-seok\n*[[Kim Sung-oh]] as Jong-seok, Man-Seok's brother\n*[[Kim Tae-hoon (actor)|Kim Tae-hoon]] as Detective Kim Chi-gon\n*[[Thanayong Wongtrakunl]] as Lum Ramrowan\n*[[Lee Do-gyeom]] as Child at workplace\n*Kim Hyo-seo as Hyo-jeong, So-mi's mother\n*Lee Jong-yi as Detective No\n*Song Young-chang as Oh Myung-gyu\n*Jo Seok-hyuon as Moon Dal-seo\n*[[Jo Jae-yoon]] as Jang Doo-sik\n*Hong So-hee as Yeon-soo\n*Hwang Min-ho as Nam Sung-Sik\n*[[Kwak Do-won|Kwak Byung-Kyu]] as Detective Kim\n*Lee Jae-won as Du-chi\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Release==\nDuring its August 6\u20138 opening weekend, the film recorded 712,840 admissions, taking the number 1 spot on the box office charts for five weeks straight.
