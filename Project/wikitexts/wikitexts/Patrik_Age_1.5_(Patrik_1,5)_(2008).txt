After meeting their new neighbors and settling into their jobs, they decide to adopt a child. Although they are married, no country is willing to let a gay couple adopt any of its children. After initially being turned down by the adoption agency, a Swedish orphan becomes available, whom they readily agree to adopt. However, a typographical error on the papers changed the child's age from \"15\" to \"1.5\". When their new son Patrik ([[Tom Ljungman]]) arrives, they are shocked to find him a troubled teenager with a criminal background.\n\nHurrying to the adoption agency to rectify the error, they arrive to find there is nothing that can be done until the next week. Over the next few days, Sven is appalled by Patrik's insulting behavior, even though G\u00f6ran sees the good in him. Patrik is initially fearful of both men, believing stereotypes that gays are pedophiles.  Once the agency reopens, all three are told by the officials that Patrik's only options are living with them or returning to the foster center where he came from. After living up to his troublemaking habits, Patrik causes Sven to leave in disgust over G\u00f6ran's unwillingness to kick Patrik out. G\u00f6ran agrees to look after Patrik until the agency can find a suitable home for him. Over the next few days, Patrik reveals his talent for gardening, and G\u00f6ran grows to accept him.\n\nAfter several weeks, the agency notifies G\u00f6ran that a family has been found for Patrik, who by this time has gotten past his initial fear and contempt for his surrogate parents. Sven returns as he and G\u00f6ran both realize their issues were not worth ending their relationship. Patrik's new father arrives to pick him up, and he leaves with him. After a short time, Patrik returns, and the three then live together permanently.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Gustaf Skarsg\u00e5rd]] as G\u00f6ran Skoogh \n* [[Torkel Petersson]] as Sven Skoogh \n* [[Tom Ljungman]] as Patrik \n* [[Anders L\u00f6nnbro]] as Urban Adler\n\n==Release==\n{{More citations needed section|date=November 2014}}\n\nThe film was shown at the 2008 [[Toronto International Film Festival]]<ref name=variety>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.variety.com/review/VE1117938339.html?categoryid=2863&cs=1 |title=Patrik, Age 1.5 Movie Review From The Toronto Film Festival |magazine=Variety |date=September 12, 2008 |accessdate=February 22, 2009 | first=Dennis | last=Harvey}}</ref> and the 2009 [[London Lesbian and Gay Film Festival]]. It was screened to a sold-out cinema at the [[Seattle International Film Festival]] for the festival's annual \"Gay-la\" event. It is the opening night film at the 2009 [[Inside Out Film and Video Festival]], and was a centerpiece film for [[Frameline]] in San Francisco in June 2009. It was the closing film at the Dublin Gay and Lesbian Film Festival (GAZE) in August 2009 and at the Glasgay! Film Festival in October 2009. Also screened at the Hong Kong Lesbian and Gay Film Festival and the Rehoboth Beach Film Festival (where it placed 3rd for Best Feature) in November 2009, and at the 25th Gay and Lesbian Film Festival in Ljubljana, Slovenia, in early December 2009, where a discussion was held with director Ella Lemhagen after the sold-out (closing) screening at the Slovenian Cinematheque.\n\n==Production==\nPatrik, Age 1.5 is technically based on a stage production; however, director Ella Lemhagen didn't like the script of the play all that much, and decided to just use the film's pitch and to build up a new story from scratch. While doing so, she interviewed the first Swedish gay couple given permission to adopt, in 2003, and who by 2010 were still waiting to actually adopt.<ref name=\"Ryll 2014\">{{cite web |url=http://gay-themed-films.com/watch-patrik-age-1-5/ |title=Essential Gay Themed Films To Watch, Patrik Age 1.5 |author=Alexander Ryll | publisher=Gay Essential |accessdate=5 February 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\nThe film received generally positive reviews from critics.
