Keaton plays the title character, a father and musician killed in a car accident, only to be brought back to life in the form of a snowman via a magical harmonica. It received mixed to negative reviews and became a [[box-office bomb]], grossing just $34 million against a budget of $40\u201385 million.\n\nThree of [[Frank Zappa]]'s four children, [[Dweezil Zappa]], [[Ahmet Zappa]], and [[Moon Unit Zappa]], appear in the film.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.allmovie.com/work/jack-frost-174141/cast |title=Jack Frost (1998) - Trailers, Reviews, Synopsis, Showtimes and Cast |publisher=AllMovie |date=December 11, 1998 |access-date=December 18, 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n{{overly detailed|date=October 2022}}\nJack Frost (Keaton) is the lead singer in a rock band based in the fictional town of Medford, [[Colorado]]. His focus on his music and his hopes that the band will sign a record deal leads him to neglect his family, including his 11-year-old son Charlie.\n\nCharlie gets into a snowball fight with local bully Rory Buck. Charlie and Jack build a [[snowman]] together, and Jack gives Charlie his best [[harmonica]], which he got the day Charlie was born. He jokingly tells Charlie that it's magical, and that Jack will be able to hear it wherever he is. Jack promises his wife Gabby that he will attend Charlie's hockey game, but misses it in favor of recording a new hit song \"Don't Lose Your Faith\". To make up for it, Jack then promises to take his family on a Christmas trip to the mountains, but is then called in on a gig that could make or break his career. On his way to the gig, Jack realizes his mistake and borrows his best friend (and the band's keyboardist) Mac MacArthur's car to go to the mountains to meet his family. Unfortunately, Jack encounters a bad snowstorm, crashes the car, and is killed instantly (off-screen).\n\nA year later, Charlie has fallen into depression over his father's death. One night, he makes another snowman that bears as much of a resemblance to Jack as he can remember and plays Jack's harmonica just before going to sleep. The harmonica turns out to be magical after all, as it revives Jack, transferring his spirit into the snowman. Jack attempts to greet Charlie, but ends up terrifying him instead. When Charlie winds up in the snowball battlefield, Jack pelts Rory and the other children with snowballs and escapes with Charlie on a sled. After Jack uses his nickname \"Charlie boy\", Charlie realizes that the snowman is his father. Jack reconnects with Charlie and teaches him the values that he never got to teach him when he was alive. Jack convinces Charlie to rejoin his hockey team instead of continuing to grieve over his death; Charlie becomes their best player. In the meantime, Mac continues to be a friend of the family, while also becoming a father figure to Charlie at Gabby's suggestion.\n\nAs winter approaches its end, Jack begins melting and struggles to get to Charlie's hockey game, but is successful in doing so. Afterwards, Charlie decides to take Jack to the mountains where it is colder, but has a difficult time convincing Gabby to do so. Charlie comes across Rory, and, after Jack speaks in front of Rory, Rory sympathizes with Charlie not having a father and helps him sneak Jack onto a truck en route to the mountains. Jack and Charlie arrive at the isolated cabin that the family was going to stay at for Christmas before Jack's death. Jack calls Gabby, nonchalantly asking her to come to the cabin to pick up Charlie; Gabby is shocked, but recognizes his voice and obliges. Jack tells a disheartened Charlie that he has to leave. When Gabby arrives, the snowman shell dissipates, revealing Jack in an ethereal form. Jack tells Charlie he will be with him wherever he goes and, after saying farewell and giving his love to both his wife and son, returns to the [[afterlife]].\n\nIn the closing moments of the film, Charlie plays hockey with his group of friends (which now includes Rory), while Gabby happily watches and Mac plays music on the piano. The final street scene shows that all the front lawns have snowmen on them.\n\n==Cast==\n\n===Live action===\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Michael Keaton]] as Jack Frost/snowman (voice), Charlie's father, the vocalist and harmonica player of The Jack Frost Band who ends up dying in a car accident, trying to get home to spend time with his family.
