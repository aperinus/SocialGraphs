Famine is not his problem. However, a passing r\u014dnin bursts into the rebels, Sakon Shiba is simply carried by his curiosity. He can only join these men despised but weak in the face of the strength of a Lord. The r\u014dnin quickly manages to bring back another r\u014dnin, from such a poor condition that he prefers to sleep in prison. The trio are complemented by the Lord's bodyguard, who understands that his status as a saber-man prevents him from basking in a stable and calm life. And during the three men join forces to affirm the word of the peasants, the latter remain passive and afraid, they are locked in the fear of dying.\n\n==Release==\nThe film was released in Japan in 1964. On February 14, 2012, the Criterion Collection released a [[DVD]] and [[Blu-ray]] of the film.<ref name=\"criterion\" />\n\n==Reception==\n[[Bilge Ebiri]], commissioned by [[Criterion Collection]] to write an essay on the film, wrote:<ref>{{cite web | url= http://www.criterion.com/current/posts/2148-three-outlaw-samurai-the-disloyal-bunch/ | title= Three Outlaw Samurai: The Disloyal Bunch | first= Bilge |last= Ebiri | authorlink= Bilge Ebiri | date= February 14, 2012 | publisher= [[Criterion Collection]] | accessdate=2013-12-04}}</ref>\n\n<blockquote>\"''Three Outlaw Samurai'' is a supremely confident big-screen debut, whose surface simplicity masks a scathing vision of society lurking beneath. In some ways, it recalls [[Akira Kurosawa|Kurosawa]]'s samurai narratives, with its tale of renegade [[r\u014dnin]] who come to the aid of the dispossessed. But Gosha's personal obsessions are all over the film, particularly in his depiction of the loss of honor through blind loyalty (and its liberating opposite, the regaining of honor by betrayal), and in the sharp contrast he makes between the refined, comforting worlds of power and social duty and the wild, almost animalistic existence of those who choose freedom. And unlike Kurosawa, whose characters tend to be classically drawn and endlessly layered, Gosha often works in broad strokes: his characters are [[archetype]]s, which he then deconstructs and plays off one another. A samurai can go from fighting alongside a group to fighting against them in one brief shot, as in ''Three Outlaw Samurai''. These characters may be simple, but Gosha\u2019s real interest is in the portrait of society he is creating&mdash;and that is anything but.\"</blockquote>\n\n[[Glenn Erickson]], in an article for [[Turner Classic Movies]] published after the [[Criterion Collection]] Blu-ray release, wrote:<ref>{{cite web | url= http://www.criterion.com/current/posts/2148-three-outlaw-samurai-the-disloyal-bunch/ | title= ''Three Outlaw Samurai'' - The 1964 Debut Film of Hideo Gosha| first= Glenn |last= Erickson | authorlink= Glenn Erickson| date= | publisher= [[Turner Classic Movies]] | accessdate=2013-12-04}}</ref>\n<blockquote>\"[I]t's an impressively well-told story with interesting characters and a surprise in every scene. Gosha and his writers Keiichi Abe and Eizaburo Shiba work clever games with the standard samurai archetypes: all are present, yet they refuse to accept their traditional roles. Gosha's thriller soon lets us know that it is not going to be yet another simplistic morality play about honor and loyalty....[Gosha]  makes ''Three Outlaw Samurai'' a thorough critique of [[authoritarian]] society and the traditional honor code of the samurai. In Gosha's view the oppressive forces are money, power and class. The magistrate subscribes to no code except his own convenience and prestige. The only honor to be found in is therefore the opposition of unjust authority.\"</blockquote>[[Rian Johnson]] has said that ''Three Outlaw Samurai'' influenced the writing of his [[Star Wars]] film ''[[Star Wars: The Last Jedi|The Last Jedi.]]''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/05/star-wars-the-last-jedi-cover-portfolio|title=Star Wars: The Last Jedi, the Definitive Preview|last=Kamp|first=David|date=May 24, 2017|website=Vanity Fair|access-date=2017-12-11}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Allmovie title|335039}}\n* {{IMDb title|0058652}}\n* {{Rotten Tomatoes | m/three_outlaw_samurai | Three Outlaw Samurai}}\n*[https://www.criterion.com/current/posts/2148-three-outlaw-samurai-the-disloyal-bunch ''Three Outlaw Samurai: The Disloyal Bunch''] an essay by [[Bilge Ebiri]] at the [[Criterion Collection]]\n\n{{Hideo Gosha}}\n\n[[Category:1964 films]]\n[[Category:1964 drama films]]\n[[Category:1960s action films]]\n[[Category:Japanese drama films]]\n[[Category:Japanese black-and-white films]]\n[[Category:Samurai films]]\n[[Category:Films based on television series]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Hideo Gosha]]\n[[Category:1960s Japanese films]]"}]}}}}
