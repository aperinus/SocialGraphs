It tells the story of [[Lady Jane Grey]], her marriage to [[Lord Guildford Dudley]], and her reign as the \"Nine Days' Queen\" following the death of [[Edward VI of England]].\n\nThe story had previously been turned into a 1936 film, ''[[Tudor Rose (film)|Tudor Rose]]'', and a 1923 silent film, ''Lady Jane Grey; Or, The Court of Intrigue''.\n\n== Plot ==\nThe death of King [[Henry VIII of England]] throws his kingdom into chaos as his successor, [[Edward VI of England]], is both under-age and in poor health. Anticipating the young king's imminent death from [[tuberculosis]] and anxious to keep England true to the [[Protestant Reformation]] by keeping the Catholic [[Mary I of England|Princess Mary]] from the throne, [[John Dudley, 1st Duke of Northumberland]], [[Lord President of the Council]] and second only to the king in power, hatches a plan to marry his second son, [[Lord Guildford Dudley|Lord Guildford]], to Lady Jane Grey, and have the royal physician keep the young king Edward VI alive&mdash;albeit in excruciating pain&mdash;long enough to get him to name Jane his heir.\n\nJane is unhappy with the proposed marriage, and is forced into it through [[corporal punishment]] by her parents. At first, Jane and Guildford treat their union as a [[marriage of convenience]], but later fall deeply in love.\n\nAfter King Edward VI dies, Jane is placed on the throne. She is troubled by the questionable legality of her accession, but after consulting with Guildford, turns the tables on John Dudley and the others who thought to use her as a puppet.\n\nAfter only nine days, however, Queen Jane's council abandon her because of her designs for reforming the country. The council then supports Mary, who at first imprisons Jane and Guildford.\n\nConsumed with guilt, Jane's father, the Duke of Suffolk, raises a rebellion to restore her to the throne, presumably in concert with [[Wyatt's rebellion|Thomas Wyatt's rebellion]]. When the rebellion fails, Queen Mary I offers to spare Jane's life if she renounces her Protestant faith. When she refuses, Jane, her father and Guildford are executed.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Helena Bonham Carter]] as [[Lady Jane Grey]]\n* [[Cary Elwes]] as [[Lord Guildford Dudley]], Jane's husband\n* [[Jane Lapotaire]] as Queen [[Mary I of England]]\n* [[Patrick Stewart]] as [[Henry Grey, 1st Duke of Suffolk]], Jane's father\n* [[Sara Kestelman]] as [[Lady Frances Brandon]], Jane's mother\n* [[Michael Hordern]] as [[John Feckenham|Doctor Feckenham]]\n* [[John Wood (English actor)|John Wood]] as [[John Dudley, 1st Duke of Northumberland]]\n* [[Jill Bennett (British actress)|Jill Bennett]] as Mrs. Ellen, Lady-in-Waiting\n* [[Joss Ackland]] as [[John Brydges, 1st Baron Chandos|Sir John Bridges]]\n* [[Ian Hogg (actor)|Ian Hogg]] as [[John Gates (courtier)|Sir John Gates]]\n* [[Richard Johnson (actor)|Richard Johnson]] as the [[Henry FitzAlan, 19th Earl of Arundel|Earl of Arundel]]\n* Warren Saire as King [[Edward VI of England]]\n* [[Lee Montague]] as [[Simon Renard|Renard, Spanish Ambassador]]\n* [[Richard Vernon]] as The Marquess of Winchester\n* [[Adele Anderson]] as Lady Warwick\n* [[Pip Torrens]] as Thomas\n* [[Matthew Guinness]] as [[George Owen (physician)|Doctor Owen]]\n* [[Guy Henry (actor)|Guy Henry]] as [[Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester|Lord Robert Dudley]]\n* [[W.
