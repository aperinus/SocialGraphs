It received mixed reviews from critics and grossed $102 million.\n\n==Plot==\nElizabeth Masterson, a young emergency medicine physician in [[San Francisco]] whose work is everything, is in a serious car accident while on her way to a [[blind date]] at her sister's. Three months later, landscape architect David Abbott, needing a fresh start from a tragic event, moves into Elizabeth's apartment, after 'discovering' it in what seems to be a fateful [[Wiktionary:happenstance#English|happenstance]].\n\nElizabeth begins to appear to David in the apartment, and both are confused. She thinks he's a squatter, and he thinks she broke in. Soon they see she isn't really alive as she can suddenly appear and disappear, and move through walls and objects. Elizabeth doesn't know who she is, and insists she's not dead. David unsuccessfully tries to have her spirit exorcised from the apartment. \n\nDavid enlists the help of [[psychic]] bookstore clerk, Darryl, who says Elizabeth isn't really dead. He also tells David he's clearly got a blocked heart, and needs to let go of the woman who was previously in his life. When Elizabeth says David should get over being dumped, he storms out, and Darryl tells Elizabeth to not disrespect the dead. She finds David and he explains his wife Laura had died.\n\nAs only David can see and hear her, others think he is hallucinating, drinking, and talking to himself. Elizabeth asks him to help her discover who she is and what happened. David talks to her neighbours but they didn't know her. \n\nEntering a restaurant, a man has a medical emergency, so Elizabeth helps David save his life. Suddenly, she remembers being a doctor, and they go to the nearest hospital, where it all comes flooding back. Her mentor Fran tells David that Elizabeth was in an accident three months ago, and has been in a coma. When David touches the her hand, Elizabeth feels it, so she knows she's still connected to her body.\n\nElizabeth's sister Abby arrives, and the attending doctor notifies her that Elizabeth signed a [[Do not resuscitate|DNR]] order, but as she was a doctor there, they've treated her as a special case. However, he asks Abby to disconnect life support, and she says she'll consider it.\n\nDavid and Elizabeth bond, and he tells her about his wife's death. When he takes her out to a beautiful landscaped garden he designed, she tells him she senses she has been there before. In fact, she was dreaming of the garden in the opening scenes of the film, while cat-napping during a long shift.\n\nWhen David's told he's been offered a long term lease, he realises Elizabeth will be taken off life support. He tries to prevent it by going to Abby's to tell her that Elizabeth is communicating with him, proving it by telling Abby things only Elizabeth knows. While there, her niece Lily can sense her, putting a cookie on the plate before her. \n\nDavid begs Abby to keep her alive, but she has already signed the papers so Elizabeth will be taken off life support the next day. As a last ditch effort, David blurts out Abby's secret from her wedding day, freaking her out so she drives him out of her house with a knife.\n\nElizabeth opts to spend her last night with David in the apartment. The next morning, he is determined to prevent her death by stealing her body from the hospital. He enlists his friend/therapist Jack (Abby's former college boyfriend) to help him. He had set David up a blind date with Elizabeth on the night of the accident - David can see Elizabeth because they were meant to meet. He admits to Jack and Elizabeth that he loves her which is why he doesn't want her to die; he has gotten past his wife's death.\n\nSecurity guards soon catch them trying to steal Elizabeth's body. As they pull Jack away from her, her breathing tube comes off. As Elizabeth is now dying, David frantically kisses her, while her spirit begins to fade away. Then, amazingly, her heartbeat returns and she awakens from the coma. Elizabeth recognizes Abby, but not David, and he sadly leaves.\n\nSometime later, Elizabeth moves back into her apartment. Drawn to the roof, she finds David, who has transformed it into a landscaped garden. He reveals he'd gotten in using the spare key her spirit had shown him. When she asks for her key back, their hands touch, her memory of the events during her coma are restored, and they kiss happily.\n\nThe final scene fades away from the rooftop to show Darryl staring into a [[snow globe]].\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Reese Witherspoon]] as Dr. Elizabeth Masterson\n* [[Mark Ruffalo]] as David Abbott\n* [[Ivana Mili\u010devi\u0107]] as Katrina\n* [[Jon Heder]] as Darryl\n* [[Donal Logue]] as Jack\n*[[Dina Spybey|Dina Waters]] as Abby Brody\n* [[Rosalind Chao]] as Dr. Fran Lo\n* [[Ben Shenkman]] as Dr. Brett Rushton\n* [[Joel McKinnon Miller]] as Lead Ghostbuster\n* [[Caroline Aaron]] as Grace\n* [[Kerris Dorsey]] as Zoe Brody\n* Alyssa Shafer as Lily Brody\n* [[Willie Garson]] as Maitre D'\n}}\n\n==Critical reception==\nOn [[Rotten Tomatoes]] the film holds an approval rating of 54% based on 151 reviews, with an average rating of 5.6/10.
