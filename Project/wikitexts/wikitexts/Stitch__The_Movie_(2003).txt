The Movie''''' is a 2003 American [[animation|animated]] [[science fiction]] [[comedy film]] produced by [[Disney Television Animation|Walt Disney Television Animation]] and [[Rough Draft Korea]], released on August 26, 2003.<ref>{{cite web|title=Stitch! The Movie\" On DVD and Video August 26|url=http://disney.go.com/disneyvideos/newsletter/aug2003/feature.html|publisher=Disney|access-date=October 13, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030809124731/http://disney.go.com/disneyvideos/newsletter/aug2003/feature.html|archive-date=August 9, 2003|date=August 2003|url-status=live}}</ref> It is the second film released in the ''[[Lilo & Stitch (franchise)|Lilo & Stitch]]'' franchise and the third film chronologically, taking place after [[Lilo & Stitch|the 2002 first film]] and (by later extension) the 2005 direct-to-video sequel ''[[Lilo & Stitch 2: Stitch Has a Glitch]]''. The film also serves as the [[Television pilot#Backdoor pilot|backdoor pilot]] of the [[spin-off (media)|spin-off]] sequel series ''[[Lilo & Stitch: The Series]]'', which debuted the following month. The story is an introduction to Dr. [[Jumba Jookiba]]'s [[List of Lilo & Stitch characters#Experiments|625 experiments]] (made prior to [[Stitch (Disney)|Stitch]]) that he created with the financing of [[Dr. Jacques von H\u00e4msterviel]].\n\n== Plot ==\n[[Stitch (Disney)|Stitch]] is still not fitting in and causes another disaster. [[List of Lilo & Stitch characters#Lilo Pelekai|Lilo]] tries to encourage him by saying he's one-of-a-kind, comparing him to [[Frankenstein's monster]], which just makes him feel worse. Meanwhile, ex-captain [[List of Lilo & Stitch characters#Gantu|Gantu]], who's in his new spaceship after his original one got destroyed when [[Lilo & Stitch|he kidnapped]] Lilo and tried to recapture Stitch, is hired by [[List of Lilo & Stitch characters#Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]]'s former partner; a diminutive creature resembling a cross between a [[hamster]], [[poodle]] and [[rabbit]] named [[List of Lilo & Stitch characters#Dr. H\u00e4msterviel|Dr. Jacques von H\u00e4msterviel]] to retrieve [[List of Lilo & Stitch characters#Experiments|the other 625 experiments]]. Gantu goes to Earth, breaking into Lilo and Stitch's home, blasting Stitch into a net, finding and taking a blue pod with the number 625 on it, and abducting Jumba for interrogation. Stitch and Lilo take Jumba's spaceship and chase Gantu into outer space, engaging him in battle, only to be defeated and fall back towards Earth.\n\nBack at their house, Lilo, Stitch and [[List of Lilo & Stitch characters#Wendy Pleakley|Pleakley]] find the container Jumba was hiding. Pleakley realizes that these are the other 625 experiments, in [[Desiccation|dehydrated]] form, and warns them not to tell anyone or put the experiments in water, aware of how dangerous they are. Deliberately disobeying Pleakley's orders, Stitch and Lilo retrieve the container and hydrate one of the experiments, [[List of Lilo & Stitch characters#Sparky (X-221)|Experiment 221]], who promptly escapes into the night. Jumba is being held captive on the ship of Dr. H\u00e4msterviel. Unable to intimidate Jumba, H\u00e4msterviel activates another experiment, [[List of Lilo & Stitch characters#Reuben (X-625)|Experiment 625]], to attack him. Although 625 has all of Stitch's powers, he is incredibly lazy and a terrible coward, prioritizing making [[sandwich]]es above all else. Meanwhile, Pleakley is able to call H\u00e4msterviel's ship via telephone. H\u00e4msterviel tells Pleakley that he wants a ransom of the other 624 experiments in return for Jumba. When Pleakley informs the other family members what the ransom is, Nani proceeds to call [[List of Lilo & Stitch characters#Cobra Bubbles|Cobra Bubbles]] about the problem while Lilo and Stitch go out to find 221. When Cobra arrives the next morning, he seems to already know about what happened. Meanwhile, Stitch and Lilo finally manage to catch a troublesome Experiment 221 at a nearby hotel with a glass vase and soon befriend him.\n\nThe rendezvous time arrives and Pleakley and Cobra show up with the container, not knowing that it contains only 623 experiments. Pleakley hands the container over to H\u00e4msterviel, who is shocked to find that one is missing. Lilo then shows up with Experiment 221 trapped in the vase. Announcing that she has named it \"Sparky\", she says that Sparky is part of Stitch's, and thus her, ''{{okina}}[[ohana]]''. Furious, H\u00e4msterviel tells her to give him the experiment or Jumba will die. After several moments of thinking and hearing Cobra, Pleakley, Jumba and H\u00e4msterviel persuading them, Lilo and Stitch set Sparky free and break Jumba from his bonds. On Cobra's signal, [[List of Lilo & Stitch characters#Grand Councilwoman|the Grand Councilwoman's]] ship rises out of the nearby ocean and aims several guns at H\u00e4msterviel to obliterate him. Lilo protests, saying that H\u00e4msterviel has the other experiments while Sparky overhears this. Sparky then proceeds to use his electrical abilities to blow the power on the Councilwoman's ship, while H\u00e4msterviel and Gantu climb back aboard their own ship with the captured experiments. In a last attempt to stop H\u00e4msterviel, Lilo, Stitch and Sparky stow away on it as it leaves Earth.\n\nInside the ship, Lilo and Stitch manage to swipe the container with the other experiments in it. The struggle for the container between Lilo, Stitch and Gantu results in releasing the dehydrated pods to rain down and scatter throughout Hawaii. Having captured the two, H\u00e4msterviel reveals his plans to clone Stitch a thousand times over and orders Gantu to do what he wants with Lilo. While Gantu puts Lilo in a teleportation pod to send her to an intergalactic [[zoo]], Stitch is strapped to a weight just heavier than he can lift. Watching as Stitch tries to avoid being vivisected by a laser for the cloning process, Sparky shows that he has reformed by short-circuiting the cloning machine. He then breaks Stitch free from his bonds and the two strap H\u00e4msterviel to the device before they rescue Lilo.\n\nHaving locked H\u00e4msterviel in handcuffs, Lilo, Stitch, and Sparky short-circuit Gantu's ship, causing it to crash near a waterfall on [[Kauai]]. Landing H\u00e4msterviel's ship back at the rendezvous point, they give Sparky a new home powering [[Kilauea Light|K\u012blauea Lighthouse]], which hasn't been running in years because powering it was very expensive.{{efn|In real life, K\u012blauea Lighthouse actually was not operational at the time this film was released. The real lighthouse was deactivated in 1976, but resumed operation in 2013.}} They then persuade the Grand Councilwoman to let them rehabilitate the other 623 experiments. The Councilwoman places H\u00e4msterviel under arrest, and Jumba whispers to Pleakley that he has plans for making Experiment 627.{{efn|Experiment 627 later makes his debut in the ''Lilo & Stitch: The Series'' episode \"627\", which is named after him.}} At that moment, Experiments 202, 529, 455, 489, and 390{{efn|According to the experiments list seen in the credits of ''[[Leroy & Stitch]]'' (2006), the respective names that those experiments would be given after the events of ''Stitch! The Movie'' are Jam, Digger, Mary, Huggo, and Slimy.}} are activated, [[Lilo & Stitch: The Series|beginning the events of the series]].\n\nLater, Jumba and Pleakley hope to go home with the Grand Councilwoman this time, but they are left stranded on Earth once again.\n\n==Voice cast==\n* [[Chris Sanders]] as [[Stitch (Disney)|Stitch a.k.a.
