But according to [[Joseph Zito]], director of what was to become ''Missing in Action'', it was decided that the sequel was a much better film and would be a more successful first film. Consequently, Cannon just switched titles and release dates so that the planned sequel was released first, and the planned first film was released as a prequel.  It was followed by another sequel, ''[[Braddock: Missing in Action III]]'', featuring the same character, but with a [[Sequel#Standalone sequel|stand-alone screenplay]].\n\n==Plot==\nTen years before freeing the US POWs from a brutal General, Colonel James Braddock ([[Chuck Norris]]) was held in a  North [[Vietnam]]ese POW camp run by sadistic Colonel Yin ([[Soon-Teck Oh]]), who forces the POWs to grow [[opium]] for a French drug runner named Fran\u00e7ois (Pierre Issot), and tries to get Braddock to admit to and sign a long list of [[war crime]]s. One of his fellow soldiers Captain David Nester ([[Steven Williams]]) has been convinced (likely by Yin) that their country's abandoned them and has become one of Yin's henchmen for which his fellow soldiers denounce him as a traitor. During his team's time in captivity, they are relentlessly subjected to various forms of humiliating [[torture]], such as Sergeant Opelka having an unloaded pistol fired into his head, Yin forcing Braddock and Nester to have a fist fight and Braddock being hung by his feet and having a bag with a rat inside it placed over his head and Braddock being told that his wife has left him and remarried.\n\nFranklin, another US POW, starts to suffer from [[malaria]], and Braddock exchanges an admission of guilt to Yin's charges of war crimes for medicine for the infected soldier. Yin breaks his deal with Braddock, and gives the soldier a lethal dose of [[opium]] and later cremates him in front of Braddock. Enraged, Braddock escapes from the camp, plots to free his fellow prisoners and destroy the prison camp. Yin then betrays Fran\u00e7ois, taking his helicopter to search for Braddock and also takes control of his drug ring.\n\nBraddock inflicts several losses against Yin's men, leading to Yin's second-in-command to dress a Vietnamese soldier as Colonel Yin, shoot him and take another POW named Anthony Mazilli hostage in an attempt to lure Braddock into the open. Braddock notices that the decoy is not wearing Yin's boots, and proceeds to kill Yin's men while Nester sacrifices himself in a gunfire to allow Mazilli to escape. Eventually, Braddock fights Yin hand to hand in Yin's quarters. Subduing Yin, Braddock escorts the prisoners to an awaiting helicopter although not before igniting explosive charges planted around Yin's quarters.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Chuck Norris]] as Colonel James Braddock\n* [[Soon-Tek Oh]] as Colonel Yin \n* [[Steven Williams]] as Captain David Nester\n* Bennett Ohta as Captain Ho\n* Cosie Costa as Lieutenant Anthony Mazilli\n* Joe Michael Terry as Corporal Lawrence Opelka\n* Christopher Cary as Emerson\n* [[John Wesley (actor)|John Wesley]] as Master Sergeant Ernest Franklin\n* [[David Chung (actor)|David Chung]] as Dou Chou\n* [[Professor Toru Tanaka]] as Lao\n* Dean Raphael Ferrandini as Harry Kirtle\n* Pierre Issot as Francois\n* [[Mischa Hausserman]] as Kelly\n* Randon Lo as Hooker #1\n* Michiyo Tanaka as Hooker #2\n* [[Andrea Lowe]] as Hooker #3\n* [[Nan Martin]] as Hooker #4\n* [[Sergio Kato]] as Stunt Double\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nNorris says he was approached to make the film by Lance Hool, who had a script about American POWs in Vietnam. Norris was enthusiastic because he wanted to pay tribute to his brother Wieland. Vietnam films were not popular at the time, and Norris and Hool received numerous rejections.<ref name=\"Norris p 121\">Norris p 121</ref>\n\nHool and Norris took the project to Cannon Films, who liked the project. They already had a script in development about the rescue of American POWS in Vietnam, and signed Norris to make both movies. The first, ''Missing in Action'', would be about Braddock's rescue of POWS. The second, ''Missing in Action 2'', would be a prequel about Braddock's years as a POW. The  two films were shot back to back. Joseph Zito directed the first, Hool the second.<ref name=\"Norris p 121\"/>\n\n===Filming===\nFilming was to have started in [[Saint Kitts]] in January 1984,<ref>Sneed & Lavin INC.: Good night, Walter!\nChicago Tribune 8 Dec 1983: 24.</ref><ref name=\"lance\">WORK STARTS ON WAR FILM IN ST.

They hung me upside down, put the sack over my head, I got the rat in my mouth and there's fake blood coming down the rope into my mouth. All I can taste is mountain rat and I'm thinking, 'I'm gonna get the bubonic plague.'\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.empireonline.com/movies/features/chuck-norris/|title = Chuck Norris: In His Own Words}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Box office===\nThe film opened at #3, grossing $3,868,515 in the opening weekend.

What's missing is any sense of responsibility: toward history, toward Vietnam's actual combatants or even to the movie's fictional characters. They all simply become cheap fodder in a cheap revenge saga, a fantasy whose sole obsession is to 'win', and rub the enemy's nose in the blood and gore of that victory.\"<ref>Wilmington, Michael (March 5, 1985). \"Responsibility Missing in 'Missing in Action 2'\".
