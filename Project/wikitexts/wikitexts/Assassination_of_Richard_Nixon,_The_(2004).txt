It is based on the story of would-be [[assassination|assassin]] [[Samuel Byck]], who plotted to kill [[Richard Nixon]] in 1974. It was screened in the [[Un Certain Regard]] section at the [[2004 Cannes Film Festival]].<ref name=\"festival-cannes.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/4200653/year/2004.html|title=The Assassination of Richard Nixon|access-date=November 30, 2009|work=Cannes Festival}}</ref> The last name of the main character was changed to Bicke.<ref name=\"Ebert\" />\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1973, 43-year-old [[Philadelphia]] resident Sam Bicke ([[Sean Penn]]) is a down on his luck salesman who desperately wishes to reconcile with his estranged wife Marie ([[Naomi Watts]]). A constant moralizer, he states that he stopped working at the [[tire]] shop owned by his brother Julius ([[Michael Wincott]]) because he would lie to his customers. Believing that society's discrimination affects poor white people just as much as it does [[African American|blacks]], he attempts to join the [[Black Panthers]]. His dream is to own his own mobile tire sales business in partnership with his best friend, African-American mechanic Bonny ([[Don Cheadle]]).\n\nHe finds employment at an office furniture retail business, where his new boss Jack ([[Jack Thompson (actor)|Jack Thompson]]) gives him patronizing advice, while his awkwardness makes him a poor salesman. Jack describes US president [[Richard Nixon]] as the greatest salesman in history, because [[1968 United States presidential election|his election promise in 1968]] was to exit the [[Vietnam War]], and four years later he again coasted to win an easy [[1972 United States presidential election|re-election in 1972]] on the promise of ending the same war.\n\nBicke becomes increasingly disillusioned with his status in society. He applies for a government loan to set up the business with Bonny, and he frantically waits for an answer in the mail. His sales figures continue to deteriorate, and Jack, who only hires married salesmen, begins to suspect Sam lied about his marriage. In fact, Marie keeps rebutting all of Sam's awkward attempts at reconciling, and later sends him a divorce decree, leaving him weeping in despair. Shortly afterwards, he deliberately tanks a sale and quits his job. While watching Nixon giving a speech on TV during the [[Watergate scandal]], he screams at him, \"It's about money, Dick!\" With the loan still not finalized, he breaks into his brother's tire sales business to make a large order that will be delivered to Bonny. Ultimately, the loan is rejected, his rent is past due, and his brother Julius reveals he had to bail out Bonny, who was arrested for receiving stolen goods, and is now done entirely with his deadbeat, hypocritical brother.\n\nA broken Sam begins obsessing more and more about Nixon. One night, after watching a news story about [[1974 White House helicopter incident|a helicopter pilot who did a fly-by]] around the [[White House]] and got arrested, he begins putting together a plan to hijack a passenger airliner and crash it into the White House. In the two weeks leading to his action, he records a message detailing his intentions and state of mind and addressed to [[Leonard Bernstein]], whom he greatly admires.\n\nSam liquidates his bank account, steals Bonny's gun, and heads to a restaurant where Jack is dining. He aims the gun at Jack under the table, but cannot pull the trigger and flees. He goes to his and Marie's old house and sleeps in the empty home, then shoots and kills the family dog. The next morning, he drives to the [[Baltimore\u2013Washington International Airport]] with the gun concealed against his leg and a suitcase full of gasoline. After mailing his confession to Bernstein, he plans to wait in line to board a flight, but seeing the security procedures are more thorough than expected, he panics and rushes on board, shooting a cop as he goes.\n\nOnce on board he haphazardly shoots one pilot in the head and the other in the shoulder, then finds a passenger to act as co-pilot. However, he is shot through a window by an intervening policeman, but commits suicide before he could be killed or arrested. The day's events are shown on TV, though neither Bonny nor Marie appear to react to the mention of Sam's name.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Sean Penn]] as Samuel \"Sam\" Bicke, a salesman with a history of short-lived jobs\n* [[Naomi Watts]] as Marie Andersen Bicke, Sam's ex-wife\n* [[Don Cheadle]] as Bonny Simmons, Sam's best friend and potential business partner\n* [[Jack Thompson (actor)|Jack Thompson]] as Jack Jones, Sam's new employer at a furniture retail\n* [[Mykelti Williamson]] as Harold Mann, head of the local Black Panther chapter\n* [[Michael Wincott]] as Julius Bicke, Sam's brother\n* [[Nick Searcy]] as Tom Ford, director of the local loan agency\n* [[Brad William Henke]] as Martin Jones, Jack's son and a salesman\n* [[Joe Marinelli]] as Mel Samuels\n\n==Reception==\nOn [[Rotten Tomatoes]] the film has an approval rating of 67% based on reviews from 132 critics.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/assassination_of_richard_nixon/ |title=The Assassination of Richard Nixon |publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |access-date=December 27, 2020 }}</ref> On [[Metacritic]] the film has a score of 68% based on reviews from 38 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".<ref>{{cite web |title=The Assassination of Richard Nixon |url=https://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-assassination-of-richard-nixon |website=[[Metacritic]] |access-date=2021-09-09 }}</ref>\n\n''[[Empire (film magazine)|Empire]]'' gave the film four stars out of five stating, \"it's great to see the courage of '70s Hollywood meeting the conviction of 21st-century indie cinema in this stark, bold drama.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.empireonline.com/movies/reviews/assassination-richard-nixon-review/|title=Empire's The Assassination Of Richard Nixon Movie Review|work=Empire |access-date=September 13, 2013 }}</ref> \n[[Roger Ebert]] gave it 3.5 out of 4 stars.<ref name=\"Ebert\">{{cite web |date=2005 |last=Ebert |first=Roger |author-link=Roger Ebert |title=The Assassination of Richard Nixon movie review (2005) |url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/the-assassination-of-richard-nixon-2005 |website=[[Chicago Sun-Times]] }}</ref>\n\nStephen Hunter of [[The Washington Post]] wrote: \"It grinds on without mercy.
