It tells the story of a young woman, Melanie, who is captured after the human race has been taken over by parasitic aliens called \"Souls\". After Melanie is infused with a \"Soul\" called \"Wanderer\", Melanie and the alien \"Soul\" vie for control of her body.\n\nThe film stars [[Saoirse Ronan]], [[Max Irons]], [[Jake Abel]], [[William Hurt]], and [[Diane Kruger]]. Released in theaters on March 29, 2013, the film was poorly received by critics and grossed $63.3 million worldwide against a budget of $40 million.\n\n==Plot==\nSmall parasitic aliens called \"Souls\", who travel to planets inserting themselves into a host body of that planet's dominant species while suppressing the host's consciousness, have taken over the human race. Deeming humans too violent to deserve the planet, they have now almost successfully conquered Earth. The original owner's consciousness is erased, but the Souls can access the host's memories, and occupied hosts are identifiable by silver rings in their eyes.\n\nA human on the run, Melanie Stryder, is captured and infused with a Soul called \"Wanderer\", whom a \"Seeker\" soul has asked to access Melanie's memories and learn the location of a pocket of unassimilated humans. Melanie's consciousness, however, has not been completely eliminated; she and Wanderer carry out an internal conversation and debate with each other, eventually becoming friends.\n\nWanderer tells Seeker that Melanie was traveling with her brother, Jamie, and her boyfriend, Jared Howe, to find Melanie's uncle Jeb in the desert. Wanderer admits that Melanie is still present, so Seeker decides to be transferred into Melanie's body to get the information herself. With Melanie\u2019s guidance, Wanderer escapes to the desert, where Jeb finds her and takes her to a series of caves inside a mountain where the humans (including Jared and Jamie) are hiding.\n\nWanderer's presence is met with hostility by all but Jeb and Jamie. Melanie instructs Wanderer not to tell anyone she is still alive, since it would provoke them, though she later allows her to tell Jamie. Wanderer begins interacting with the humans and slowly starts gaining their trust, bonding with Ian O'Shea.\n\nSeeker leads a search party into the desert. They intercept one of the shelter's supply teams, and in the ensuing chase, Aaron and Brandt commit suicide to avoid capture. During the chase, Seeker accidentally kills another Soul, leading her superiors to call off the search.\n\nJared and Kyle move to kill Wanderer, causing Jamie to reveal that Melanie's consciousness is alive. Jeb and Ian accept this, but Jared refuses to believe it until he strategically kisses Wanderer, provoking Melanie to take back control and slap him, proving to Jared that she is still alive. Kyle tries to kill Wanderer but endangers his own life, and Wanderer ends up saving him. Ian believes that Kyle attacked Wanderer and tells her he has feelings for her. Wanderer admits that Melanie's body is compelled to love Jared, but she has feelings of her own, and the two kiss.\n\nWanderer enters the community's medical facility and is shocked to discover that Doc has been experimenting with ways to remove Souls and allow the host's mind to regain control, resulting in the deaths of many Souls and hosts. After isolating herself for several days, Wanderer learns that Jamie is critically ill with an infection in his leg. She infiltrates a Soul medical facility to steal some alien medicine, saving Jamie's life.\n\nSeeker has continued looking for Wanderer on her own, but Jeb captures her. Wanderer offers to show Doc how to properly remove Souls, on the condition that he later remove her from Melanie's body. Doc uses the technique to remove Seeker from her host, with both host and Soul surviving. Wanderer takes Seeker\u2019s tiny alien form to a Soul space-travel site, where she sends it so far from Earth that it can not return for numerous generations.\n\nTired of the many lives she\u2019s lived and finding it too painful to leave everyone behind, Wanderer makes Doc promise to let her die when she is removed and not tell anyone. The others in the shelter intervene with Doc, who inserts Wanderer into Pet, a human who was left brain-dead after the Soul inside her was removed. Now with a body of her own, Wanderer is able to be with Ian, while Melanie reunites with Jared.\n\nA few months later, while on a supply run, Wanderer, Melanie, Ian and Jared are captured. They discover that their captors are humans, who reveal that there are several other human groups as well. They also learn that a Soul with this group has sided with the human resistance, as Wanderer has, and they may not be the last Souls to do so.\n\n==Cast==\n{{main|List of The Host characters}}\n{{div col}}\n* [[Saoirse Ronan]] as Melanie \"Mel\" Stryder / Wanderer \"Wanda\" <ref>{{cite magazine |last = Staskiewicz |first = Keith |title = Saoirse Ronan cast in film of Stephenie Meyer's 'The Host' |magazine = [[Entertainment Weekly]] |url = https://ew.com/article/2011/05/03/saoirse-ronan-the-host/ |date = May 3, 2011 |access-date = May 26, 2018}}</ref>\n* [[Max Irons]] as Jared Howe<ref name=\"Abel\" />\n* [[Jake Abel]] as Ian O'Shea<ref name=\"Abel\">{{cite web |last = Bentley |first = Jean |title = Max Irons, Jake Abel land male leads in Stephenie Meyer's 'The Host' |url = http://screenertv.com/news-features/max-irons-jake-abel-land-male-leads-in-stephenie-meyers-the-host/ |work = Zap2It |date = November 10, 2011 |access-date = May 26, 2018}}</ref>\n* [[Frances Fisher]] as Magnolia \"Maggie\" <ref name=\"Information-Stephenie-Meyer\" />\n* [[Chandler Canterbury]] as Jamie Stryder<ref name=\"Boyd\" />\n* [[Diane Kruger]] as Seeker & Lacey<ref>{{cite web |last = Fleming |first = Mike |title = Diane Kruger To Play The Seeker In Stephenie Meyer's 'The Host' |url = https://www.deadline.com/2012/01/diane-kruger-to-play-the-seeker-in-stephenie-meyers-the-host/ |work = Deadline Hollywood |date = January 20, 2012 |access-date = May 26, 2018}}</ref>\n* [[William Hurt]] as Jebediah\n* [[Boyd Holbrook]] as Kyle<ref name=\"Boyd\">{{cite web |last = Sneider |first = Jeff |title = Canterbury, Holbrook land 'Host' |url = https://variety.com/2012/film/news/canterbury-holbrook-land-host-1118048975/ |work = Variety | date = January 21, 2012 |access-date = May 26, 2018}}</ref>\n* [[Scott Lawrence]] as Doc\n* [[Rachel Roberts (model)|Rachel Roberts]] as Soul Fleur\n* Shawn Carter Peterson as Wes\n* Lee Hardee as Aaron<ref name=\"Lee\">{{cite web |author = Sarah |title = Review: Stephenie Meyer's 'The Host' |url = http://www.thehostmovienews.com/2012/11/review-stephenie-meyers-the-host-the-official-illustrated-movie-companion/ |website = thehostmovienews.com |access-date = December 26, 2012}} <!-- fansite? --></ref>\n* Phil Austin as Seeker Waverly\n* Raeden Greer as Lily\n* [[J.
