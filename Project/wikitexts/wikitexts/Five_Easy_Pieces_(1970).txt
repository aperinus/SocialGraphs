The film tells the story of surly [[oil rig]] worker Bobby Dupea, whose rootless [[working class in the United States|blue-collar]] existence belies his privileged youth as a piano [[child prodigy|prodigy]]. When Bobby learns that his father is dying, he travels to his family home in [[Washington (state)|Washington]] to visit him, taking along his uncouth girlfriend.\n\nThe film was nominated for four [[Academy Awards]] and five [[Golden Globe Award]]s, and in 2000, was included in the annual selection of 25 motion pictures added to the United States [[National Film Registry]] of the [[Library of Congress]] being deemed \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\" and recommended for preservation.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Librarian of Congress Names 25 More Films to National Film Registry|url=https://www.loc.gov/item/prn-00-200/librarian-of-congress-names-25-more-films-to-national-film-registry/2000-12-27/|access-date=2020-10-02|website=Library of Congress}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Complete National Film Registry Listing |url=https://www.loc.gov/programs/national-film-preservation-board/film-registry/complete-national-film-registry-listing/|access-date=2020-10-02|website=Library of Congress}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nBobby Dupea works in an oil field in [[Kern County, California]]. He spends most of his time with his girlfriend Rayette, a waitress who has dreams of singing country music, or with his friend, fellow oil worker Elton, with whom he bowls, gets drunk, and philanders. While Bobby acts the part of a blue-collar laborer, he is secretly a former classical pianist who comes from an upper-class family of musicians.\n\nWhen Bobby gets Rayette pregnant and Elton is arrested, Bobby quits his job and goes to Los Angeles, where his sister Partita, also a pianist, is making a recording. Partita tells him that their father, from whom Bobby is estranged, has suffered two strokes, and urges him to return to the family home in [[Washington (state)|Washington]].\n\nRayette threatens to kill herself if Bobby leaves her, so he reluctantly asks her along. Driving north, they pick up two stranded women headed for Alaska, Terry and Palm. The latter launches into a monologue about the evils of [[consumerism]]. The four are thrown out of a restaurant after Bobby gets into a sarcastic argument with an obstinate waitress who refuses to accommodate his request for toast.\n\nEmbarrassed by Rayette's lack of polish, Bobby registers her in a motel before driving alone to the family home on an island in [[Puget Sound]]. He finds Partita giving their father a haircut, and the old man seems completely oblivious to him. At dinner, Bobby meets Catherine Van Oost, a young pianist engaged to his amiable brother Carl, a violinist. Despite personality differences, Catherine and Bobby are immediately attracted to each other and later have sex in her room.\n\nRayette runs out of money at the motel and comes to the Dupea estate unannounced. Her presence creates an awkward situation, but when a pompous family friend, Samia Glavia, ridicules her, Bobby comes to her defense. Storming from the room in search of Catherine, he discovers his father's male nurse giving Partita a massage. He picks a fight with the very strong nurse, who easily subdues him.\n\nBobby tries to persuade Catherine to go away with him, but she declines, telling him he cannot ask for love when he does not love himself, or anything at all. After trying to talk to his unresponsive father, Bobby leaves with Rayette. Shortly into the trip, they stop for gas, and while Rayette goes into a diner for coffee, Bobby abandons her, hitching a ride on a truck headed north.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Jack Nicholson]] as Robert \"Bobby\" Eroica Dupea\n* [[Karen Black]] as Rayette Dipesto\n* [[Susan Anspach]] as Catherine Van Oost\n* [[Lois Smith]] as Partita Dupea\n* [[Ralph Waite]] as Carl Fidelio Dupea\n* [[Billy \"Green\" Bush]] as Elton\n* [[Irene Dailey]] as Samia Glavia\n* [[Toni Basil]] as Terry Grouse\n* [[Helena Kallianiotes]] as Palm Apodaca\n* [[William Challee]] as Nicholas Dupea\n* [[John P.
