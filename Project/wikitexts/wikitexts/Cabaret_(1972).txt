A new British arrival in the city, Brian Roberts, moves into the [[boarding house]] where Sally lives. A reserved academic and writer, Brian must give English lessons to earn a living while completing his doctorate. Sally tries to seduce Brian, but he tells her that on three previous occasions he has tried to have sexual relationships with women, all of which failed. They become friends, and Brian witnesses Sally's [[bohemian life]] in the last days of the [[Weimar Republic]]. When Brian consoles Sally after her father cancels his meeting with her, they become lovers, concluding that his previous failures with women were because they were \"the wrong three girls\".\n\nMaximilian von Heune, a rich, married playboy and [[baron]], befriends Sally and takes her and Brian to his country estate where they are both spoiled and courted. After a somewhat enigmatic experience with Brian, Max drops his pursuit of the pair in haste. During an argument, Sally tells Brian that she has been having sex with Max, and Brian reveals that he has as well. Brian and Sally later reconcile, and Sally reveals that Max left them 300 [[Deutsche mark|marks]] and mockingly compares the sum with what a professional prostitute earns.\n\nSally learns that she is pregnant but is unsure of the father. Brian offers to marry her and take her back to his university life in [[Cambridge]]. At first, they celebrate their resolution to start this new life together, but after a picnic between Sally and Brian, in which Brian acts distant and uninterested, Sally becomes disheartened by the vision of herself as a bored faculty wife washing dirty diapers. Ultimately, she has an abortion, without informing Brian in advance. When he confronts her, she shares her fears, and the two reach an understanding. Brian departs for England, and Sally continues her life in Berlin, embedding herself in the Kit Kat Klub.\n \nA subplot concerns Fritz Wendel, a German Jew [[Passing (racial identity)|passing]] as a Protestant, who is in love with Natalia Landauer, a wealthy German Jewish heiress who holds him in contempt and suspects his motives. Through Brian, Sally advises him to be more aggressive, which eventually enables Fritz to win her love. However, to gain her parents' consent for their marriage, Fritz must reveal his background, which he does and the two are married by a rabbi.\n\nThe rise of [[fascism]] is an ever-present undercurrent throughout the film. Their progress can be tracked through the characters' changing actions and attitudes. While in the beginning of the film, a Nazi is expelled from the Kit Kat Klub, the final shot of the film shows the cabaret's audience is dominated by uniformed Nazis. The rise of the Nazis is also demonstrated in a rural [[beer garden]] scene. A blonde boy sings to an audience of all ages (\"Tomorrow Belongs to Me\") about the beauties of nature and youth. It is revealed that the boy is wearing a [[Hitler Youth]] uniform. The ballad transforms into a militant Nazi anthem, and one by one nearly all the adults and young people watching rise and join in the singing. \"Do you still think you can control them?\" Brian asks Max. Later, Brian's confrontation with a Nazi on a Berlin street leads to his being beaten.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Liza Minnelli]] as [[Sally Bowles]]\n* [[Michael York]] as Brian Roberts\n* [[Helmut Griem]] as Baron Maximilian von Heune\n* [[Joel Grey]] as Master of Ceremonies\n* [[Fritz Wepper]] as Fritz Wendel\n* [[Marisa Berenson]] as Natalia Landauer\n* [[Elisabeth Neumann-Viertel]] as Fr\u00e4ulein Schneider\n* [[Helen Vita]] as Fr\u00e4ulein Kost\n* Sigrid von Richthofen as Fr\u00e4ulein Mayr\n* [[Gerd Vespermann]] as Bobby\n* [[Ralf Wolter]] as Herr Ludwig\n* [[Ricky Ren\u00e9e]] as Elke, transvestite in Kit Kat Klub\n* [[Kathryn Doby]] - Mausie\n* [[:de:Estrongo Nachama]] - Cantor\n}}\n\nIn addition, in a joint uncredited role, Oliver Collignon plays the [[Hitler Youth|Nazi youth]], with his singing voice for \"Tomorrow Belongs to Me\" dubbed by [[Mark Lambert (American actor)|Mark Lambert]].<ref name=\"TCM Notes\"/>\n\n== Production ==\n=== Historical basis ===\n{{Further|Christopher Isherwood|Jean Ross}}\n{{CSS image crop|Image = Jean ross.jpg|bSize = 310|cWidth = 200|cHeight = 190|oTop = 25|oLeft = 50|Location = right|Description = The character of [[Sally Bowles]] was based upon [[Jean Ross]], a British cabaret singer with whom Isherwood lived as a room-mate in Weimar-era Berlin.|Link=Jean Ross}}\n\nThe 1972 film was based upon Christopher Isherwood's semi-autobiographical stories about [[Weimar culture|Weimar-era Berlin]] during the [[Jazz Age]].{{r|Doyle 2013|Moss 1979}} In 1929, Isherwood moved to Berlin  in order to pursue life as an openly gay man and to enjoy the city's libertine nightlife.{{r|Doyle 2013|Moss 1979}} His [[Auden Group|expatriate social circle]] included [[W.H.

Determined to direct the film, Fosse begged Feuer to hire him.<ref name=\"TCM Notes\"/> However, Fosse had previously directed the unsuccessful film adaptation of ''Sweet Charity'', a box office failure which made chief executives Manny Wolf and [[Martin Baum (agent)|Marty Baum]] reluctant to hire him.<ref name=\"TCM Notes\"/> Wolf and Baum preferred a more renowned or established director such as [[Billy Wilder]], [[Joseph L. Mankiewicz]] or [[Gene Kelly]].<ref name=\"TCM Notes\"/>{{r|Garebian 2011|p=134}}\n\nEager to hire Fosse, Feuer appealed to the studio heads, citing Fosse's talent for staging and shooting musical numbers, adding that if inordinate attention was given to filming the book scenes at the expense of the musical numbers, the whole film could fail. Fosse ultimately was hired. Over the next months, Fosse met with previously hired screenwriter Jay Presson Allen to discuss the screenplay.{{r|Garebian 2011|pp=136-139}}\n\n=== Screenplay revisions ===\nAs production neared, Fosse became increasingly dissatisfied with Allen's script which was based on [[Joe Masteroff]]'s original book of the stage version. Fosse hired [[Hugh Wheeler]] to rewrite and revise Allen's work.{{r|Garebian 2011|pp=136-139}} Wheeler was referred to as a \"research consultant,\" and Allen retained screenwriting credit. Wheeler, a friend of Christopher Isherwood,<ref name=\"Day 1974\"/> knew that Isherwood had been critical of the stage musical due to its bowdlerizations of his material.<ref name=\"Day 1974\"/> Wheeler went back to Isherwood's original stories in order to ensure a more faithful adaptation of the source material. In particular, Wheeler restored the subplot about the gigolo and the Jewish heiress. Wheeler also drew on gay author Christopher Isherwood's openness about his homosexuality to make the leading male character a bisexual man \"rather than the heterosexual as he had been in the stage musical.\"{{r|Garebian 2011|p=139}}\n\nFosse decided to increase the focus on the Kit Kat Klub, where Sally performs, as a metaphor for the decadence of Germany in the 1930s by eliminating all but one of the musical numbers performed outside the club. The only remaining outside number is \"Tomorrow Belongs to Me\",<ref name=\"Benedict 2002\"/> a folk song rendered spontaneously by patrons at an [[Beer garden|open-air caf\u00e9]] in one of the film's most effective scenes.{{r|Belletto 2008|p=609}} In addition, the show's original songwriters Kander and Ebb wrote two new songs, \"Mein Herr\" and \"Money\", and incorporated \"Maybe This Time\", a song they had composed in 1964 and first sung by [[Kaye Ballard]].<ref name=\"Schudel 2019\"/>\n\n=== Casting ===\n{{multiple image\n |perrow = 2\n |total_width = 300\n |align = right\n |image1 = Liza Minnelli Cabaret 1972 crop 2.jpg\n |width1 = 150\n |image2 = Louise_Brooks_Stars_of_the_Photoplay.jpg\n |width2 = 150\n |alt2 = Louise Brooks was the visual model for the 1972 film\n |footer = [[Liza Minnelli]] as [[Sally Bowles]] (left) in the 1972 film. Minnelli modeled the character's appearance upon [[Louise Brooks]] (right), an American actress who was famous in 1930s [[Weimar Germany]].{{r|Garebian 2011|p=142}}\n}}\nFeuer had cast [[Liza Minnelli]] as [[Sally Bowles]] and [[Joel Grey]] (reprising his stage role) long before Fosse was attached to the project. Fosse was given the option of using Grey as Master of Ceremonies or walking away from the production.{{r|Garebian 2011|p=147-148}} Fosse hired [[Michael York]] as Sally Bowles's bisexual love interest, a casting choice which Minnelli initially believed was incorrect until she performed with him.{{r|Garebian 2011|p=146}} Several smaller roles, as well as the remaining four dancers in the film, eventually were cast in West Germany.\n\nMinnelli had auditioned to play Sally in the original Broadway production but was deemed too inexperienced at the time, even though she had won Broadway's [[Tony Award for Best Actress in a Musical]]. By the time ''Cabaret'' reached the screen, however, Minnelli was a film star having earned an Oscar nomination as the emotionally damaged college student in ''[[The Sterile Cuckoo]]'' (1969).\n\nFor her performance as Sally in the film, Minnelli reinterpreted the character and\u2014at the explicit suggestion of her father, film and [[Theatre director|stage director]] [[Vincente Minnelli]]<ref name=\"Minnelli 2006\"/>\u2014she deliberately imitated film actress [[Louise Brooks]], a [[flapper|flapper icon]] and [[sex symbol]] of the [[Jazz Age]].<ref name=\"Minnelli 2006\"/>{{r|Garebian 2011|p=142}} Brooks, much like the character of Sally Bowles in the film, was an aspiring actress and American [[Expatriate|expat]] who temporarily moved to Weimar Berlin in search of international stardom.{{r|Garebian 2011|p=139}} Minnelli later recalled:\n\n{{Blockquote|\"I went to my father and asked him, 'What can you tell me about 1930s glamour? Should I be emulating [[Marlene Dietrich]] or something?' And he said 'No, study everything you can about [[Louise Brooks]].'\"<ref name=\"Minnelli 2006\"/>}}\n\nIn particular, Minnelli drew upon Brooks' \"[[Pandora's Box (1929 film)|Lulu makeup]] and [[Shingle bob|helmet-like coiffure]].\"{{r|Garebian 2011|p=142}} For the meeting between Sally Bowles and Brian Roberts, Minnelli modeled her movements and demeanor upon Brooks; in particular, the scene in ''[[Pandora's Box (1929 film)|Pandora's Box]]'' (1929) where Brooks' carefree character of Lulu is first introduced.<ref name=\"Garebian 2011\"/> Ultimately, Minnelli would win the [[Academy Award for Best Actress]] for her portrayal of Sally Bowles.<ref name=\"Buck 1973\"/>\n\n=== Filming ===\nFosse and Feuer traveled to West Germany, where producers chose to shoot the film, in order to finish assembling the film crew. During this time, Fosse highly recommended [[Robert Surtees (cinematographer)|Robert L. Surtees]] for cinematographer, but Feuer and the top executives saw Surtees's work on ''Sweet Charity'' as one of the film's many artistic problems. Producers eventually chose British cinematographer [[Geoffrey Unsworth]].{{r|Garebian 2011|pp=138, 149}} Designers [[Rolf Zehetbauer]], [[Hans J\u00fcrgen Kiebach]] and [[Herbert Strabel]] served as production designers. Charlotte Flemming designed costumes.{{r|Garebian 2011|p=205}} Dancers [[Kathryn Doby]], Louise Quick and John Sharpe were brought on as Fosse's dance aides.\n\nRehearsals and filming took place entirely in West Germany. For reasons of economy, indoor scenes were shot at the [[Bavaria Studios|Bavaria Film Studios]] in [[Gr\u00fcnwald, Bavaria|Gr\u00fcnwald]],{{r|Garebian 2011|p=143}} outside Munich.<ref name=\"TCM Notes\"/>{{r|Garebian 2011|p=146}} Prior to filming, Fosse would complain every afternoon on the set of ''[[Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory]]'' because that film was overrunning and keeping him from starting work on the same stage.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Aguiar |first1=Annabel |title='Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory' at 50: The tender yet terrifying movie that never lost its flavor |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/arts-entertainment/2021/06/29/willy-wonka-chocolate-factory-anniversary/ |newspaper=Washington Post |date=June 29, 2021}}</ref>\n\n=== Narrative and news reading ===\nAlthough the songs throughout the film allude to and advance the narrative, every song except \"Tomorrow Belongs to Me\" is executed in the context of a Kit Kat Klub performance.<ref name=\"Russell 2002\"/><ref name=\"Benedict 2002\"/> The voice heard on the radio reading the news throughout the film in German was that of associate producer Harold Nebenzal, whose father [[Seymour Nebenzahl]] produced such notable [[Weimar]] films as ''[[M (1931 film)|M]]'' (1931), ''[[Testament of Dr. Mabuse]]'' (1933), and ''[[Threepenny Opera (film)|Threepenny Opera]]'' (1931).\n\n== Differences between film and stage version ==\nThe film significantly differs from the Broadway musical. In the stage version, Sally is English (as she was in Isherwood's ''[[Goodbye to Berlin]]'').

Part of its success comes because it doesn't fall for the old clich\u00e9 that musicals have to make you happy. Instead of cheapening the movie version by lightening its load of despair, director Bob Fosse has gone right to the bleak heart of the material and stayed there well enough to win an [[Academy Award for Best Director]].\"<ref name=\"Ebert 1972\"/>\n\nA.D. Murphy of ''Variety'' wrote \"The film version of the 1966 John Kander-Fred Ebb Broadway musical ''Cabaret'' is most unusual: it is literate, bawdy, sophisticated, sensual, cynical, heart-warming, and disturbingly thought-provoking. Liza Minnelli heads a strong cast. Bob Fosse's generally excellent direction recreates the milieu of Germany some 40 years ago.\"<ref name=\"Variety 1971\"/>\n\n[[Roger Greenspun]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote in February 1972 that \"''Cabaret'' is one of those immensely gratifying imperfect works in which from beginning to end you can literally feel a movie coming to life.\"<ref name=\"Greenspun 1972\"/> Likewise, [[Pauline Kael]] of ''[[The New Yorker]]'' wrote a review that same month in which she applauded the film: {{Blockquote|\"A great movie musical. Taking its form from political cabaret, it's a satire of temptations. In a prodigious balancing act, Bob Fosse, the choreographer-director, keeps the period\u2014Berlin, 1931\u2014at a cool distance. We see the decadence as garish and sleazy; yet we also see the animal energy in it\u2014everything seems to become sexualized. The movie does not exploit decadence; rather, it gives it its due.

(7893554712) (cropped1).jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.8|[[Christopher Isherwood]] disliked the 1972 film as he felt it depicted homosexuality in a negative light.{{r|Isherwood 1976|p=63}}]]\nAlthough ''Cabaret'' (1972) was well received by film critics upon its release,<ref name=\"Greenspun 1972\"/><ref name=\"Ebert 1972\"/><ref name=\"Variety 1971\"/><ref name=\"Kael 1972\"/> author Christopher Isherwood and other persons upon whom the film's characters were based were less receptive towards the cinematic adaptation.<ref name=\"Spender 1977\"/>{{r|Isherwood 1976|p=63}} Isherwood himself was critical of the 1972 film due to what he perceived as its negative portrayal of homosexuality: {{Blockquote|\"In the film of ''Cabaret'', the male lead is called Brian Roberts. He is a bisexual Englishman; he has an affair with Sally and, later, with one of Sally's lovers, a German baron...Brian's homosexual tendency is treated as an indecent but comic weakness to be snickered at, like [[bed-wetting]].\"{{r|Isherwood 1976|p=63}}}}\n\nSimilarly, Isherwood's friend [[Jean Ross]]\u2014upon whom the character of Sally Bowles was based{{r|Bletchly 2013|p=26}}\u2014was ambivalent about the film.{{r|Isherwood 2012|p=70}} She felt the depiction of 1930s Berlin \"was quite, quite different\" from reality.{{r|Johnstone 1975|pp=33\u201334}} Nevertheless, she conceded that the depiction of their social circle of British expatriates as pleasure-seeking libertines was accurate: \"We were all utterly against the [[bourgeois]] standards of our parents' generation. That's what took us to [Weimar-era] Berlin. The climate was freer there.\"{{r|Johnstone 1975|pp=33\u201334}} Such ambivalence towards ''Cabaret'' (1972) was not unique among Isherwood's circle.<ref name=\"Spender 1977\"/>\n\nThe poet [[Stephen Spender]] lamented how ''Cabaret'' (1972) glossed over Weimar Berlin's crushing poverty:\n{{Blockquote|\"There is not a single meal, or club, in the movie ''Cabaret,'' that Christopher [Isherwood] and I could have afforded [in 1931]. What we mostly knew was the Berlin of poverty, unemployment, political demonstrations and street fighting between forces of the extreme left and the extreme right.\"<ref name=\"Spender 1977\"/>}} Both Spender and Ross contended that the 1972 film and 1966 Broadway musical deleteriously glamorized the harsh realities of the 1930s Weimar era.<ref name=\"Spender 1977\"/>{{r|Johnstone 1975|pp=33\u201334}}\n\n==== Retrospective reviews ====\nIn 2002, Jamie Russell of the BBC wrote that the film was \"the first musical ever to be given an [[X certificate]], Bob Fosse's ''Cabaret'' launched Liza Minnelli into Hollywood superstardom and re-invented the musical for the Age of Aquarius.\"<ref name=\"Russell 2002\"/> In 2013, film critic [[Peter Bradshaw]] listed ''Cabaret'' at number one on his list of \"Top 10 musicals\", describing it as \"satanically catchy, terrifyingly seductive...directed and choreographed with electric style by Bob Fosse...''Cabaret'' is drenched in the sexiest kind of cynicism and decadent despair.\"<ref name=\"Bradshaw 2013\"/>\n\n==== Controversies ====\nAlthough less explicit compared with other films made in the 1970s, ''Cabaret'' dealt explicitly with topics like corruption, sexual ambiguity, false dreams, and Nazism. Tim Dirks at Filmsite.org notes: \"The sexually-charged, semi-controversial, kinky musical was the first one ever to be given an X rating (although later re-rated) with its numerous sexual flings and hedonistic club life. There was considerable sexual innuendo, profanity, casual sex talk (homosexual and heterosexual), some evidence of anti-Semitism, and even an abortion in the film.\"<ref name=\"Dirks 2013\"/> It was also rated [[History of British film certificates|X in the UK]] and later re-rated as 15.<ref name=\"Russell 2002\"/><ref name=\"BBFC\"/>\n\nOn the topic of Nazism, there was little consensus among critics about the possibly fascist implications of the film and play. However, critic Steven Belletto wrote a critique of ''Cabaret'' in the ''Criticism'' journal, published by Wayne State University Press, in which he highlighted the anti-fascist themes in the film present both within and outside of the musical acts. According to Belletto, \"despite the ways that the film has been understood by a variety of critics, [''Cabaret''] rejects the logic of fascist certainty by staging various numbers committed to irony and ambiguity.\"<ref name=\"Belletto 2008 609\u2013630\"/>\n\nThe \"Tomorrow Belongs to Me\" scene was controversial, with Kander and Ebb, both of whom were Jews, sometimes being wrongly accused of using a [[Nazi songs|historical Nazi song]].<ref name=\"Steyn 1997\"/> According to an article in ''Variety'' in November 1976, the film was censored in West Berlin when it was first released there theatrically, with the sequence featuring the Hitler Youth singing \"Tomorrow Belongs to Me\" having been deleted.<ref name=\"TCM Notes\"/> This elimination was made \"because of the feeling that it might stir up resentments in the audience by showing the sympathizers for the Nazi movement during the '30s.\"<ref name=\"TCM Notes\"/> The sequence was restored, however, when the film was shown on West German television on November 7, 1976.<ref name=\"TCM Notes\"/>\n\nAnother topic of discussion was the song \"If You Could See Her\",{{r|Belletto 2008|p=610}} which closed with the line: \"If you could see her through my eyes, she wouldn't look Jewish at all.\" The point of the song was showing anti-Semitism as it begins to run rampant in Berlin, but there were a number of Jewish groups who interpreted the lyrics differently.<ref name=\"McLaughlin 2013\"/>{{r|Belletto 2008|p=625}}\n\n=== Accolades ===\n''Cabaret'' earned a total of 10 Academy Award nominations (winning 8 of them) and holds the [[List of Academy Award records#Film records|record for most Academy Awards won by a film which did not win the Academy Award for Best Picture]].<ref name=\"TCM Notes\"/><ref name=\"Academy Awards\"/>\n\nShortly before the [[45th Academy Awards|Academy Awards]], [[Bob Fosse]] won 2 [[Tony Award]]s for directing and choreographing ''[[Pippin (musical)|Pippin]]'', his biggest stage hit to date. Months later, he won the [[Primetime Emmy Award]] for choreographing and directing [[Liza Minnelli]]'s television special ''[[Liza with a Z]]'', he became the first director to win all three awards in one year.\n\n[[Image:Liza Minnelli 1973 Special.JPG|thumb|Minnelli reprised the character of Sally Bowles for an encore performance in the 1973 television special ''[[Liza with a Z]]'', also directed by [[Bob Fosse]].]]\n\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n!

National Film Registry ===\nInducted into the [[National Film Registry]] in 1995 among a list of 25 Films that year.<ref name=\"National Film Registry\"/>\n\n== Legacy ==\n''Cabaret'' has been cited by ''TV Guide'' as among the greatest films made<ref name=\"TV Guide\"/> and in ''Movieline'' magazine as one of the \"100 Best Movies Ever\".<ref name=\"Movieline Magazine\"/> It was included in Film4's \"100 Greatest Films of All Time\" at #78<ref name=\"Filmsite.org\"/> and in ''The San Francisco Chronicle''{{'}}s \"Hot 100 Films of the Past\", being hailed as \"the last great musical. Liza Minnelli plays Sally Bowles, an American adrift in pre-Nazi Berlin, in Bob Fosse's stylish, near-perfect film.\"<ref name=\"San Francisco Chronicle Film Critics\"/>\n\nDavid Benedict has written in ''The Guardian'' about ''Cabaret''{{'s}} influence in musical films: \"Back then, musicals were already low on film-goers' lists, so how come it was such a success? Simple: ''Cabaret'' is the musical for people who hate them. Given the vibrancy of its now iconic numbers \u2013 Liza Minnelli in [[bowler hat|bowler]] and black suspenders astride a bentwood chair belting out 'Mein Herr' or shimmying and shivering with pleasure over 'Money' with Joel Grey \u2013 it sounds strange to say it, but one of the chief reasons why ''Cabaret'' is so popular is that it's not shot like a musical.\"<ref name=\"Benedict 2002\"/>\n\nThe film has been listed as one of the most important for [[queer cinema]] for its depictions of bisexuality,<ref name=\"Greenspun 1972\"/> arguably transgressive at the time of its 1972 [[Motion Picture Production Code|post-Code]] release and has been credited with turning Liza Minnelli into a [[gay icon]]. Film blogs have selected it as \"the gayest winner in the history of the Academy.\"<ref name=\"Baines 2012\"/><ref name=\"St. James 2017\"/><ref name=\"Out.com\"/>\n\n=== Home media ===\nThe film was first released to DVD in 1998. There have been releases in 2003, 2008, and 2012. The film's international ancillary distribution rights are owned by ABC (now part of [[The Walt Disney Company]]), Fremantle (UK), [[Warner Bros.]] (which acquired the film as part of its purchase of [[Lorimar Productions]], which had acquired the film library of [[Monogram Pictures|Allied Artists]]) has US domestic distribution rights.\n\nIn April 2012, Warner unveiled a new restoration of the film at the [[Turner Classic Movies|TCM Classic Film Festival]].<ref name=\"McNary 2012\"/><ref name=\"TCM Festival\"/><ref name=\"Elber 2012\"/> A DigiBook edition was later released on Blu-ray on February 5, 2013.<ref name=\"Reuben 2013\"/> Before this restoration, ''Cabaret'' had been sold on a [[standard-definition]] DVD from Warner Bros., but the film was unavailable in [[High-definition video|high-definition]] or for [[Digital cinema|digital projections]] in cinemas.<ref name=\"Elber 2012\"/> The original camera negative is lost, and a surviving [[interpositive]] had a vertical scratch that ran through 1,000 feet, or 10 minutes, of one of its reels, as confirmed by Ned Price, vice president of mastering and restoration for Warner Bros.<ref name=\"Elber 2012\"/> The damage ostensibly was inflicted by a grain of dirt that had rolled through the length of the reel, beginning with a scene in which Michael York's character confronts a pro-Nazi boarding house resident, and had cut into the emulsion.<ref name=\"Elber 2012\"/> The marred frames were digitally restored, but \"the difficult part was matching the grain structure so the fix was invisible.\" After automated digital repair attempts failed, the 1,000 feet<!-- article said 1.4&nbsp;million frames, but that does not calculate. 10 minutes x 60 seconds/minute = 600 seconds x 24 Frames Per Second (FPS \u2013 a common film rate) = 14,400 frames--> of damaged film was hand painted using a computer stylus.<ref name=\"Elber 2012\"/>\n\n[[Warner Archive Collection]] reissued the Blu-ray on November 20, 2018, without the DigiBook.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.blu-ray.com/movies/Cabaret-Blu-ray/216055/#Review|title=Cabaret Blu-ray|website=Blu-ray.com|access-date=June 11, 2020}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n*

As with \"Ol' Man River\", when Cabaret called for an ostensibly innocent pastoral hymn to German nationalism, John Kander and Fred Ebb turned in such a plausible doppelganger that it was immediately denounced as a grossly offensive Nazi anthem. \"The accusations against Tomorrow Belongs To Me' made me very angry\", says Fred Ebb. \"'I knew that song as a child', one man had the audacity to tell me. A rabbinical person wrote to me saying he had absolute proof it was a Nazi song.\" It wasn't: it was written in the mid-Sixties for a Broadway musical. But today, it's the only Nazi song we all know: On election night 1987, when Spitting Image decided to draw some crass parallels between Mrs Thatcher and another strong leader, they opted to show the Tories singing not the Horst Wessel song, but \"Tomorrow Belongs To Me\" \u2013 secure in the knowledge that we'd all get the joke.\n}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"TCM Festival\">{{cite web\n | title =
