Pictures]], produced by [[David Weisbart]], directed by [[Gordon Douglas (director)|Gordon Douglas]], and starring [[James Whitmore]], [[Edmund Gwenn]], [[Joan Weldon]], and [[James Arness]].<ref name=\"Them!\">{{cite web|url= https://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/16456/them#credits|access-date=October 27, 2022|publisher=[[Turner Classic Movies]]|title=Them!}}</ref> The film is based on an original story treatment by [[George Worthing Yates]], which was then developed into a [[screenplay]] by [[Ted Sherdeman]] and adaptation by [[Russell S. Hughes|Russell Hughes]].\n\n''Them!'' is one of the first of the 1950s \"nuclear monster\" films, and the first \"[[arthropods in film|big bug]]\" [[feature film]] to use insects as the monster.\n\nA nest of [[Enlargement (in fiction)#Excessive growth|gigantic irradiated]] [[ant]]s is discovered in the [[New Mexico]] desert; they quickly become a national threat when it is discovered that two young queen ants and their consorts have escaped to establish new nests. The national search that follows finally culminates in a battle with ''Them'' in the concrete [[spillways]] and storm drain system of [[Los Angeles]].\n{{TOC limit|limit=2}}\n\n==Plot==\n[[New Mexico State Police]] Sgt. Ben Peterson and Trooper Ed Blackburn discover a little girl wandering the desert, near [[Alamogordo]], in shock and a catatonic state. They take her to a nearby vacation trailer, located by a spotter aircraft, where they find evidence that the little girl had been there when it was attacked and nearly destroyed. It is later discovered that the trailer was owned by an FBI Special Agent named Ellinson, on vacation with his wife, son, and daughter; the other members of the girl's family remain missing. Now in an ambulance, the child briefly reacts to a pulsating high-pitched sound coming from the desert. She sits upright on the stretcher, but no one else notices her reaction, and she lies back down when the noise stops.\n\nAt a general store owned by \"Gramps\" Johnson, Peterson and Blackburn find him dead and a wall of the store partially torn out. After a quick look-around, Peterson leaves Blackburn behind to secure the crime scene. Blackburn later goes outside to investigate a strange, pulsating sound. Gunshots are fired, the sound becomes faster and louder, and Blackburn goes missing. Peterson's captain later points out that both Johnson and Blackburn had fired their weapons at their attacker. More puzzling is the coroner's report on Johnson's brutal death, which includes a huge amount of [[formic acid]] being found in his body.\n\nThe FBI sends Special Agent Robert Graham to New Mexico to investigate because one of the missing persons is an FBI Agent. After a strange impression is found in the sand near the Ellisons' trailer, the Department of Agriculture sends [[Myrmecology|myrmecologists]] Dr. Harold Medford and his daughter, Dr. Pat Medford, to assist with the investigation. The elder Medford exposes the Ellinson girl to formic acid fumes, which releases her from her catatonic state; she screams in panic and yells \"Them!\". Medford's suspicions of ''[[Camponotus vicinus]]'' are validated by her reaction, but he will not reveal his theory prematurely.\n\nAt the Ellinson campsite, Pat encounters a giant, eight-foot-long foraging ant. Following instructions from the elder Medford, Peterson and Graham shoot off the ant's antennae, blinding it, and kill it using a [[Thompson submachine gun]]. Medford finally reveals his theory: a colony of giant ants, mutated by radiation from [[Trinity (nuclear test)|the first atomic bomb test]] near Alamogordo, is responsible for the area's deaths. General O'Brien orders an Army helicopter search, and the giant ants' nest is found. [[Cyanide]] gas bombs are tossed inside, and Graham, Peterson, and Pat descend into the nest to check for survivors. Deep inside, Pat finds evidence that two queens have hatched and escaped to establish new colonies.\n\nPeterson, Graham, and the Medfords join a government task force that covertly begins to investigate reports of unusual activity. In one a civilian pilot has been committed to a Texas mental hospital after claiming that he was forced down by [[Unidentified flying object|UFOs]] shaped like giant ants. Next, the Coast Guard receives a report of a giant queen hatching her brood in the hold of a freighter at sea in the Pacific; giant ants attack the ship's crew, and there are few survivors. The freighter is later sunk by U.S. Navy gunfire.\n\nA third report about a large sugar theft at a [[rail yard]] leads Peterson, Graham, and Major Kibbee to Los Angeles. An [[Alcoholism|alcoholic]] in a hospital \"[[drunk tank]]\" claims he has seen giant ants outside his window. The mutilated body of a father is recovered, but his two young sons are missing. Peterson, Graham, and Kibbee find evidence that they were flying a model airplane in the [[Los Angeles River]] drainage channel near the hospital. [[Martial law]] is declared in Los Angeles and troops are assigned to find the ants in the vast storm drain system under the city.\n\nPeterson finds the two missing boys alive, trapped by the ants near their nest. He calls for reinforcements and lifts both boys to safety, just before being attacked and grabbed by a giant ant in its mandibles. Graham arrives with reinforcements and kills the ant, but Peterson dies from his injuries as the ants swarm to protect the nest. Graham and the soldiers fight off the ants, but a tunnel collapse traps Graham. Several ants charge, but he can hold them off with his submachine gun just long enough for troops to break through. The queen and her hatchlings are discovered and quickly destroyed with [[flamethrower]]s. Dr. Medford offers a philosophic observation: \"When Man entered the [[Atomic Age]], he opened the door to a new world. What we may eventually find in that new world, nobody can predict.\"\n\n==Cast==\n*[[James Whitmore]] as Sgt.

Disney, however, was more impressed by a scene with Fess Parker as an inmate in the mental ward of the Texas hospital. Watching Parker's performance, Disney realized he had found his Davy Crockett.{{sfn|Smith|2012|p=167}} [[John Wayne]] saw the film and, impressed with Arness' performance, recommended him for the role of [[Matt Dillon (Gunsmoke)|Marshal Matt Dillon]] in the new ''[[Gunsmoke]]'' TV series, a role that Arness went on to play from 1955 to 1975.{{sfn|Warren|1982|pp=188\u2013195}}\n\n==Production==\n{{expand section|date=November 2019}}\n[[File:Themtitle.jpg|thumb|right|Opening title card with the background in [[black and white]] and ''Them!'' in red and blue]]\nWhen ''Them!'' began production in the fall of 1953, it was originally conceived to be in [[3D film|3D]] and Warner Color. During pre-production, test shots in color and 3D were made. A few color tests of the large-scale ant models were also made, but when it was time to shoot the 3D test, Warner Bros.' \"All Media\" 3D camera rig malfunctioned and no footage could be filmed. The next day a memo was sent out that the color and 3D aspects of the production were to be scrapped; widescreen black-and-white would now be the film's presentation format. Warner Bros. hoped to emulate the \"effective shock treatment\" effect of its previous science fiction thriller ''[[The Beast From 20,000 Fathoms]]''; ultimately, however, the film was never made in widescreen. Because of the preparation of certain scenes, many of the camera set-ups for 3D remain in the film, like the opening titles and the flamethrowers shots aimed directly at the camera.{{sfn|Herzberg|2007|p=176}}\n\nAlthough Warner Bros. was dissatisfied with the color results, the film's titles were printed in vivid red and blue against a black-and-white background to give the film's opening a dramatic \"punch\". This effect was achieved by an [[Eastman Color]] section spliced into each release print.{{sfn|Warren|1982|pp=188\u2013195}} The 1985 [[VHS]] tape release, the subsequent [[LaserDisc]] and later [[DVD]] release have retained this black-and-white-with-two-color title effect.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}\n\nThe entrance to the ants' final nest was filmed along the concrete spillways of the [[Los Angeles River]], between the First and Seventh Street Bridges, east of downtown. The depiction of the [[Chihuahuan Desert]] of southern New Mexico is actually the [[Mojave Desert]] near [[Palmdale, California]]. Mercy Hospital was a real institution and is now Brownsville Medical Center.{{sfn|Warren|1982|pp=188\u2013195}}\n\nJames Whitmore wore \"lifts\" in his shoes to compensate for the height difference between himself and James Arness. Whitmore also employed bits of \"business\" (hand gestures and motions) during scenes in which he appeared to draw more attention to his character when not speaking.{{sfn|Warren|1982|pp=188\u2013195}}\n\nThe [[Wilhelm scream]], created three years earlier for the film ''[[Distant Drums]]'', is used during the action sequences: when a sailor aboard the freighter is grabbed by an ant, when James Whitmore's character is caught in an ant's [[mandible (insect mouthpart)|mandibles]], and when an overhead wooden beam falls on a soldier in the Los Angeles storm drain sequence.{{sfn|Warren|1982|pp=188\u2013195}}\n\nThe giant ants, painted a purplish-green color, were constructed and operated by unseen technicians supervised by Ralph Ayers. During the climactic battle sequence in the Los Angeles sewers, there is a brief shot of one ant moving in the foreground with its side removed, revealing its mechanical interior.{{sfn|Warren|1982|pp=188\u2013195}} This blunder has been obscured in the DVD releases of the film.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}\n\nThe film poster shows a gigantic ant with menacing cat-like eyes rather than the normal [[compound eye]]s of an ant.\n\nThe sounds the giant ants emit in the film were the calls of [[bird-voiced tree frog]]s mixed in with the calls of a [[wood thrush]], [[hooded warbler]], and [[red-bellied woodpecker]]. It was recorded at Indian Island, Georgia, on April 11, 1947, by the [[Cornell Lab of Ornithology]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://sounds.bl.uk/environment/early-wildlife-recordings/022m-1cs0089948xx-0700v0 |title=Hyla avivoca: Bird-voiced Treefrog - Hylidae - Early wildlife recordings - Environment and nature &#124; British Library |publisher=Sounds |date=1947-04-11 |access-date=2018-05-06}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n''Them!'' was released in June 1954,{{sfn|Warren|1982|pp=188\u2013195}} and by the end of that year had accrued $2 million (US) in [[film distributor|distributors']] domestic (U.S. and Canada) rentals, making it the year's 51st biggest earner.<ref name=\"Gebert\">Gebert, Michael.
