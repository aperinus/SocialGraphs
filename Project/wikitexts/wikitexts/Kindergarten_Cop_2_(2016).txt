The file has been stored on a USB \"flash\" drive by a now-deceased kindergarten teacher. None of the staff or students know where the drive is, so Reed applies for the role of teacher to the bereaved class.\n\nThe school has a very liberal/modern perspective on teaching and managing children which is, at first, quite awkward to Reed's more straightforward ways. With some assistance from Sanders (father of five), Reed learns to lead the class in a more relational and emotionally-aware way. Reed's co-teacher in kindergarten, Olivia is an attractive single woman. Reed asks her out on a date and they begin to connect romantically.\n\nReed and Olivia's classes compete for a \"capture the flag\" competition which Reed's class wins once he explains a \"trojan horse\" strategy to the kids. The criminal leader, Zogu, captures the FBI surveillance van and discovers the crucial role of the children. He finds the USB drive with the children on a field trip, but they manage to surprise him with their trojan horse attack strategy.\n\nThe drive is returned to the FBI and the kids celebrate their victory with their parents.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Dolph Lundgren]] as FBI Agent Zack Reed\n* Fiona Vroom as Michelle\n* [[Aleks Paunovic]] as Alexander Zogu\n* [[Andre Tricoteux]] as Valmir\n* [[Bill Bellamy]] as Agent Sanders\n* [[Sarah Strange]] as Miss Sinclaire\n* Darla Taylor as Olivia\n* Raphael Alejandro as Cowboy\n* Enid-Raye Adams as Jett's Mom\n* [[Jody Thompson]] as Hot Mom\n* Rebecca Olson as Katja\n* Dean Petriw as Jett\n* Jenny Sandersson as Hot Mom\n* Carolyn Adair as Felicity\n* Nicholas Carella as Bernie the Hot Single Dad\n* Michael P.
