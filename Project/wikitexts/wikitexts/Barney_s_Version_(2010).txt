He marries the mentally disturbed and unfaithful Clara Charnofsky after she tells him she is pregnant with his child. He later finds out the child {{ndash}} delivered [[stillborn]] {{ndash}} is not his, and he demands they separate. She commits suicide, and a devastated Barney decides to return home to [[Montreal]].\n\nBarney soon meets the woman who becomes his second wife, the daughter of a wealthy [[Jewish people|Jewish]] family. At their lavish wedding, Barney meets Miriam Grant and immediately falls in love. He tells her his feelings for her that night but she rejects him. \n\nDespite his marriage, Barney sends Miriam flowers and gifts. He later picks up Boogie, who comes to [[detoxification|detox]], for a few days at Barney's lake house. He later finds Boogie in bed with his wife. At first overjoyed that he has an excuse to divorce her and pursue Miriam, but later he questions Boogie's integrity. The drunk men argue, Barney shoots two bullets from his gun to dissuade Boogie from snorkling, one into the air before he trips and passes out onto the dock, and Boogie falls backwards into the lake. \n\nWhen Barney awakens, Boogie is missing. A detective tries to beat a confession out of him until his father, Izzy, intervenes. Barney continues to believe that Boogie ran away, and throughout the movie waits for him to reappear.\n\nWith his divorce final, Barney asks Miriam out on a date. He travels to [[New York City]] to meet her, and finally begin a relationship. They marry and have two children as Barney gets a job [[television producer|producing]] a television series. Izzy later dies in a [[brothel]], causing Barney to laugh and cry and call his father a \"King\". Barney and Miriam live happily until, on another vacation to the lake house, Barney meets Blair, who works in radio, her old line of work. There is an immediate platonic connection between Blair and Miriam, much to Barney's noticeable consternation.\n\nAfter Barney and Miriam's son, Michael, leaves home, Miriam informs Barney of her intention to return to work. He attempts to dissuade her but she persists and secures employment, thanks to support from Blair. Miriam begins work on a radio station but Barney misses her first on air interview {{ndash}} because he \"was drunk and watching the hockey game, like has happened a thousand times before\" {{ndash}} and is rude and dismissive to Miriam's colleagues. \n\nMiriam remains steadfastly faithful to him, but eventually his picaresque behaviour results in her taking a week-long visit to Michael's place in New York. While she is absent, Barney gets drunk at a bar and ends up sleeping with a former actress on his show. He tells Miriam about his infidelity and they divorce. She later marries Blair.\n\nBarney, who displayed small signs of a deteriorating memory earlier in the film, forgetting where he had left his car on two occasions, now begins to show signs of an acute but unspecified [[memory loss]]. After Boogie's body is discovered near the lake house from an apparent [[sky diving]] accident, Miriam meets Barney for lunch in a favourite restaurant and offers to help as a friend. \n\nWhen Miriam returns from the bathroom, Barney has paid for the meal but forgotten his wallet. She follows him and, by the time she catches up to him, he has forgotten that they were divorced. He speaks to her as if it was years earlier, assuming that they're still married and that their children are quite young.\n\nBarney's condition worsens until his death. While his children are helping settle some of his affairs at the lake house, they observe a \"[[water bomber]]\" plane scoop up water from the lake and dump it on a fire on the mountainside, showing the children what could have happened to Boogie, referencing an [[urban myth]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/corpus-crispy/|title=Dead Scuba Diver in Tree}}</ref> The final scene shows Miriam visiting Barney's grave, leaving roses at a tombstone bearing both of their names.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Paul Giamatti]] as Barney Panofsky\n* [[Dustin Hoffman]] as Israel \"Izzy\" Panofsky, the father\n* [[Rosamund Pike]] as Miriam Grant, the third wife\n* [[Minnie Driver]] as the second wife\n* [[Rachelle Lefevre]] as Clara Charnofsky, the first wife\n* [[Anna Hopkins]] as Kate Panofsky, the daughter\n* [[Jake Hoffman (actor)|Jake Hoffman]] as Michael Panofsky, the son\n* [[Bruce Greenwood]] as Blair\n* [[Mark Addy]] as Detective O'Hearne\n* Paula Jean Hixson as Grumpy's Bartender\n* [[Scott Speedman]] as Bernard \"Boogie\" Moscovitch\n* Thomas Trabacchi as Leo\n* [[Cl\u00e9 Bennett]] as Cedric\n* [[Saul Rubinek]] as Mr. Charnofsky, the first father in-law\n* [[Harvey Atkin]] as the second father in-law\n* [[Macha Grenon]] as Solange, the soap opera actress\n\nThere were also cameos by Canadian directors [[Atom Egoyan]] (early director of Barney's [[soap opera]] ''Constable O'Malley of the North''), [[David Cronenberg]] (later director of Barney's soap), [[Paul Gross]] (star in Barney's soap), [[Denys Arcand]] (Jean, the ma\u00eetre d' at both of Barney and Miriam's luncheons beside the duck pond at Montreal's Ritz-Carlton), and [[Ted Kotcheff]] (train conductor).\n\n==Production==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2011}}\nAfter being in development for 12 years, the film was released in September 2010 with [[Paul Giamatti]] in the title role.
