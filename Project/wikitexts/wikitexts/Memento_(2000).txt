The film's script was based on a [[pitch (filmmaking)|pitch]] by Nolan's brother [[Jonathan Nolan]], who wrote the 2001 story \"[[Memento Mori (short story)|Memento Mori]]\" from the concept. [[Guy Pearce]] stars as Leonard Shelby, a man who suffers from [[anterograde amnesia]], resulting in short-term memory loss and the inability to form new memories. He is searching for the people who attacked him and killed his wife, using an intricate system of [[Polaroid film|Polaroid]] photographs and tattoos to track information he cannot remember. [[Carrie-Anne Moss]] and [[Joe Pantoliano]] were the co-stars of the film.\n\nThe film's [[nonlinear narrative]] is presented as two different sequences of scenes interspersed during the film: a series in [[black-and-white]] that is shown chronologically, and a series of color sequences shown in reverse order (simulating for the audience the mental state of the protagonist).

Awardsdatabase.oscars.org (January 29, 2010). Retrieved on 2011-01-26.</ref> The film is now widely regarded as one of Nolan's finest works and one of the best films of the 2000s. In 2017, the United States [[Library of Congress]] deemed the film \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\" and selected it for preservation in the [[National Film Registry]].\n\n==Plot==\nThe film starts with a [[Instant film|Polaroid]] photograph of a dead man. As the sequence plays backward, the photo reverts to its undeveloped state, entering the camera before the man is shot in the head. The film then continues, alternating between [[black-and-white]] and color sequences.\n\nThe black-and-white sequences begin with Leonard Shelby, a former insurance investigator, in a motel room speaking to an unseen and unknown caller. Leonard has [[anterograde amnesia]] and is unable to store recent memories, the result of an attack by two men. Leonard explains that he killed the attacker who raped and strangled his wife Catherine, but a second clubbed him and escaped. The police did not accept that there was a second attacker, but Leonard believes the attacker's name is \"John G\" or \"James G\". Leonard investigates using notes, Polaroid photos, and tattoos to keep track of information he discovers. Leonard recalls Sammy Jankis, another anterograde amnesiac, from his insurance industry days. After tests confirmed Sammy's inability to learn tasks through repetition, Leonard believed that his condition was at best psychological (and perhaps faked) and turned down his insurance claim. Sammy's distraught wife repeatedly asked Sammy to administer her insulin shots for her diabetes, hoping he would remember and would stop himself from giving her a fatal overdose. However, Sammy continued to administer the injections, and his wife died.\n\nThe color sequences are shown reverse-chronologically. In the story's chronology, Leonard self-directively gets a tattoo of John G's [[Vehicle registration plate|license plate]]. Finding a note in his clothes, he meets Natalie, a bartender who resents Leonard because he wears the clothes and drives the car of her boyfriend, Jimmy Grantz. After understanding Leonard's condition, she uses it to get Leonard to drive a man named Dodd out of town and offers to run the license plate as a favor. Meanwhile, Leonard meets with a contact, Teddy, who helps with Dodd, but warns about Natalie. Leonard finds that he had previously annotated his Polaroid of Teddy, warning himself not to trust him. Natalie provides Leonard with the driver's license for a John Edward Gammell, Teddy's full name. Confirming Leonard's information on \"John G\" and his warnings, Leonard drives Teddy to an abandoned building, leading to the opening where he shoots him.\n\nIn the final black-and-white sequence, prompted by the caller, Leonard meets with Teddy, an undercover officer, who has found Leonard's \"John G\", Jimmy, and directs Leonard to the abandoned building. When Jimmy arrives, Leonard strangles him fatally and takes a Polaroid photo of the body. As the photo develops, the black-and-white transitions to the final color sequence. Leonard swaps clothes with Jimmy, hearing him whisper \"Sammy\". As Leonard has only told Sammy's story to those he has met, he suddenly doubts Jimmy's role in his wife's murder. Teddy arrives and asserts that Jimmy was John G, but when Leonard is undeterred, Teddy says that he helped him kill the real attacker a year ago, and he has been using Leonard ever since. Teddy points out that since the name \"John G\" is common, Leonard will cyclically forget and begin his search again and that even Teddy himself has a \"John G\" name. Further, Teddy says that Sammy's story is Leonard's own story, a memory Leonard has repressed to escape feelings of guilt.\n\nAfter hearing Teddy confess all of this, Leonard burns the photograph of dead Jimmy and of himself right after killing the real attacker a year ago, pointing to his chest where he would get a tattoo to document his successful revenge. In a [[monologue]], Leonard explains that he is willing to lie to himself in order to get justice against anyone who has wronged him. He therefore targets Teddy by ordering a tattoo of Teddy's license plate number and writing a note to himself that Teddy is not to be trusted so that he will mistake Teddy for John G and kill him. Leonard drives off in Jimmy's car, confident that, despite this lie, he will retain enough awareness of the world to know that his actions have consequences.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast list|\n* [[Guy Pearce]] as Leonard Shelby\n* [[Carrie-Anne Moss]] as Natalie\n* [[Joe Pantoliano]] as John Edward \"Teddy\" Gammell\n* [[Mark Boone Junior]] as Burt\n* Russ Fega as Waiter\n* [[Jorja Fox]] as Catherine Shelby\n* [[Stephen Tobolowsky]] as Samuel R. \"Sammy\" Jankis\n* [[Harriet Sansom Harris]] as Mrs. Jankis\n* [[Thomas Lennon]] as Doctor\n* [[Callum Keith Rennie]] as Dodd\n* Kimberly Campbell as Blonde\n* [[Marianne Muellerleile]] as Tattooist\n* [[Larry Holden]] as James F. \"Jimmy\" Grantz\n}}\n\n==Film structure==\n[[File:Memento Timeline.png|thumb|A diagram depicting the structure of ''Memento''.]]\n\nThe film is structured with two timelines: color sequences are alternated with black-and-white sequences. The latter are put together in chronological order. The color ones, though shown forward (except for the first one, which is shown in reverse), are [[reverse chronology|ordered in reverse]]. Chronologically, the black-and-white sequences come first, the color sequences come next.\n\nUsing the numbering scheme suggested by Andy Klein\u2014who took numbers from 1 to 22 for the black-and-white sequences and letters A\u2013V for the color ones in his article for [[Salon magazine|''Salon'']] magazine<ref name=Klein/>\u2014the plotting of the film as presented is: Opening Credits (shown \"backward\"), 1, V, 2, U, 3, T, 4, S, ..., 22/A, Credits.\n\nThere is a smooth transition from the black-and-white sequence 22 to color sequence A, which occurs during the development of a Polaroid photograph.\n\nThe chronological order of the story can be viewed as a \"hidden feature\" on the 2-Disc Limited Edition [[DVD region code#1|Region 1]] [[DVD]]<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.dvdjournal.com/reviews/m/memento_le.shtml| title = 2-Disc LE DVD Review | access-date= September 24, 2009}}</ref> and the 3-Disc special Edition [[DVD region code#2|Region 2]] DVD.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/films/2004/12/15/memento_se_2004_dvd_review.shtml| title = 3 Disk SE DVD Review | access-date= September 24, 2009 }}</ref> In this special feature, the chapters of the film are put together into the chronological order and is shown: Ending Credits (run in reverse), 1, 2, 3, ..., 22/A, B, ..., V, then the opening title runs \"backward\" to what was shown (the opening title sequence is run in reverse during the actual film, so it is shown forward in this version).\n\nStefano Ghislotti wrote an article in ''Film Anthology''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dinamico2.unibg.it/fa/fa_mem01.html |title=Backwards: Memory and Fabula Construction in \"Memento\" by Christopher Nolan |work=Film Anthology |year=2003 |access-date=September 24, 2009 |first=Stefano |last=Ghislotti |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091231020648/http://dinamico2.unibg.it/fa/fa_mem01.html |archive-date=December 31, 2009}}</ref> which discusses how Nolan provides the viewer with the clues necessary to decode the plot as we watch and help us understand the chronology. The color sequences include a brief overlap to help clue the audience into the fact that they are being presented in reverse order. The purpose of the fragmented reverse sequencing is to force the audience into a sympathetic experience of Leonard's defective ability to create new long-term memories, where prior events are not recalled, since the audience has yet to see them.\n\n==Production==\n\n===Development===\nIn July 1996, brothers [[Christopher Nolan|Christopher]] and [[Jonathan Nolan]] took a cross-country road trip from [[Chicago]] to [[Los Angeles]], as Christopher was relocating his home to the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]].

Like Leonard, Earl leaves notes to himself and has tattoos with information about the killer. However, in the short story, Earl convinces himself through his own written notes to escape the mental institution and murder his wife's killer. Unlike the film, there is no ambiguity that Earl finds and kills the anonymous man.<ref name=SS/>\n\nIn July 1997, Christopher Nolan's girlfriend (later wife) [[Emma Thomas]] showed his screenplay to [[Aaron Ryder]], an executive for [[Newmarket Films]]. Ryder said the script was, \"perhaps the most innovative script I had ever seen\",<ref>Mottram, p. 176.</ref> and soon after, it was optioned by Newmarket and given a budget of $9&nbsp;million.<ref name=\"Mottram, p. 177\">Mottram, p. 177.</ref> Pre-production lasted seven weeks, during which the main shooting location changed from [[Montreal]], Quebec to [[Los Angeles]], California, to create a more realistic and ''[[film noir|noirish]]'' atmosphere for the film.<ref>Mottram, p. 151-2.</ref>\n\n===Casting===\n[[Brad Pitt]] was initially slated to play Leonard. Pitt was interested in the part, but passed due to scheduling conflicts.<ref>Mottram, p. 106.</ref> Other considered actors included [[Aaron Eckhart]] (who would later work with Nolan on ''[[The Dark Knight (film)|The Dark Knight]]'') and [[Thomas Jane]], but the role went to [[Guy Pearce]], who impressed Nolan the most. Pearce was chosen partly for his \"lack of celebrity\" (after Pitt passed, they \"decided to eschew the pursuit of [[A-list]] stars and make the film for less money by using an affordable quality actor\"), and his enthusiasm for the role, evidenced by a personal phone call Pearce made to Nolan to discuss the part.<ref>Mottram, p. 107-8.</ref>\n\nAfter being impressed by [[Carrie-Anne Moss]]'s performance as [[Trinity (The Matrix)|Trinity]] in the 1999 science fiction film ''[[The Matrix]]'', Jennifer Todd suggested her for the part of Natalie. While [[Mary McCormack]] lobbied for the role, Nolan decided to cast Moss as Natalie, saying, \"She added an enormous amount to the role of Natalie that wasn't on the page\".<ref>Mottram, p. 111.</ref> For the corrupt police officer Teddy, \"comedian [[Denis Leary]] was mentioned, though proved unavailable\".<ref name=pageoneonetwo>Mottram, p. 112.</ref> Moss suggested her co-star from ''The Matrix'', [[Joe Pantoliano]].<ref>{{cite web|title=INTERVIEW WITH JOE PANTOLIANO (PART 2 OF 2)|date=April 4, 2001|website=[[IGN]]|url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2001/04/04/interview-with-joe-pantoliano-part-2-of-2|access-date=February 6, 2017}}</ref> Although there was a concern that Pantoliano might be too villainous for the part, he was still cast, and Nolan said he was surprised by the actor's subtlety in his performance.<ref name=pageoneonetwo/>\n\nThe rest of the film's characters were quickly cast after the three main leads were established. [[Stephen Tobolowsky]] and [[Harriet Sansom Harris]] play Sammy Jankis and his wife, respectively. [[Mark Boone Junior]] landed the role of Burt, the motel clerk, because Jennifer Todd liked his \"look and attitude\" for the part (as a result he has re-appeared in minor roles in other productions by Nolan).<ref>Mottram, p. 114.</ref>\n\n===Filming===\nFilming took place from September 7 to October 8, 1999,<ref>Mottram, p. 125.</ref> a 25-day shooting schedule. Pearce was on set every day during filming, although all three principal actors (including Pantoliano and Moss) performed together only on the first day, shooting exterior sequences outside Natalie's house. All of Moss' scenes were completed in the first week,<ref>Mottram, p. 127.</ref> including follow-up scenes at Natalie's home, Ferdy's bar, and the restaurant where she meets Leonard for the final time.\n\nPantoliano returned to the set late in the second week to continue filming his scenes. On September 25, the crew shot the opening scene in which Leonard kills Teddy. Although the scene is in reverse motion, Nolan used forward-played sounds.<ref name=dvdcom>{{cite video | people=Nolan, Christopher | title=Memento DVD commentary | medium=DVD | publisher=Columbia TriStar |date=2002 }}</ref> For a shot of a shell casing flying upwards, the shell had to be dropped in front of the camera in forward motion, but it constantly rolled out of frame. Nolan was forced to blow the casing out of frame instead, but in the confusion, the crew shot it backwards.<ref name=dvdcom/> They then had to make an optical (a copy of the shot) and reverse the shot to make it go forward again. \"That was the height of complexity in terms of the film\", Nolan said. \"An optical to make a backwards running shot forwards, and the forwards shot is a simulation of a backwards shot.\"<ref name=pageonethreethree>Mottram, p. 133.</ref>\n\nThe next day, on September 26, Larry Holden returned to shoot the sequence where Leonard attacks Jimmy.<ref>Mottram, p. 134.</ref> After filming was completed five days later, Pearce's [[voice-over]]s were recorded. For the black-and-white scenes, Pearce was given free rein to improvise his narrative, allowing for a documentary feel.<ref name=pageonethreethree/>\n\nThe Travel Inn in [[Sunland-Tujunga, Los Angeles|Tujunga, California]], was repainted and used as the interior of Leonard's and Dodd's motel rooms and the exterior of the film's Discount Inn. Scenes in Sammy Jankis' house were shot in a suburban home close to [[Pasadena, California|Pasadena]], while Natalie's house was located in [[Burbank, California|Burbank]].<ref>Mottram, p. 154-5.</ref> The crew planned to shoot the derelict building set (where Leonard kills Teddy and Jimmy) in a Spanish-styled brick building owned by a train company. However, one week before shooting began, the company placed several dozen train carriages outside the building, making the exterior unfilmable. Since the interior of the building had already been built as a set, a new location had to be found. An oil refinery near [[Long Beach, California|Long Beach]] was used instead, and the scene where Leonard burns his wife's possessions was filmed on the other side of the refinery.<ref>Mottram, p. 156-7.</ref>\n\n===Music===\n[[David Julyan]] composed the film's [[Synthesizer|synthesized]] score. Julyan acknowledges several synthesized soundtracks that inspired him, such as [[Vangelis]]'s ''[[Blade Runner]]'' and [[Hans Zimmer]]'s ''[[The Thin Red Line (1998 film)|The Thin Red Line]]''.<ref>Mottram, p. 92, 96.</ref> While composing the score, Julyan created different, distinct sounds to differentiate between the color and black-and-white scenes: \"brooding and classical\" themes in the former, and \"oppressive and rumbly noise\" in the latter.<ref>Mottram, p. 96.</ref> Since he describes the entire score as \"Leonard's theme\", Julyan says, \"The emotion I was aiming at with my music was yearning and loss. But a sense of loss you feel but at the same time you don't know what it is you have lost, a sense of being adrift.\"<ref>{{cite web | last=Julyan | first=David | title=Comments on Memento | website=Davidjulyan.com |url=http://www.davidjulyan.com/scores.html| access-date=August 8, 2007 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070717155838/http://www.davidjulyan.com/scores.html |archive-date = July 17, 2007}}</ref> Initially, Nolan wanted to use [[Radiohead]]'s \"[[Paranoid Android]]\" during the end credits, but he was unable to secure the rights.<ref>Mottram, p. 99.</ref> Instead, [[David Bowie]]'s \"[[Something in the Air (David Bowie song)|Something in the Air]]\" is used, although another of Radiohead's songs, an extended version of \"[[Treefingers]]\", is included on the film's soundtrack.<ref>{{cite web | title=Track Listing for \"Memento: Music For and Inspired by the Film\" | website=CDuniverse.com | url=http://www.cduniverse.com/search/xx/music/pid/1824606/a/Memento.htm| access-date=August 8, 2007}}</ref>\n\n==Release==\nThe film gained substantial word-of-mouth press from the [[film festival]] circuit.

''Memento'' was screened for various studio heads (including [[Miramax]] chief [[Harvey Weinstein]]) in March 2000.

I think it's because people have spent the entire film looking at Leonard's photograph of Teddy, with the caption: \"Don't believe his lies.\" That image really stays in people's heads, and they still prefer to trust that image even after we make it very clear that Leonard's visual recollection is completely questionable. It was quite surprising, and it wasn't planned. What was always planned was that we don't ever step completely outside Leonard's head, and that we keep the audience in that interpretive mode of trying to analyze what they want to believe or not. For me, the crux of the movie is that the one guy who might actually be the authority on the truth of what happened is played by Joe Pantoliano ... who is so untrustworthy, especially given the baggage he carries in from his other movies: he's already seen by audiences as this character actor who's always unreliable.
