Directed by [[Roger Spottiswoode]] from a screenplay by [[Bruce Feirstein]], it follows Bond as he attempts to stop Elliot Carver ([[Jonathan Pryce]]), a power-mad [[media mogul]], from engineering world events to initiate [[World War III]].\n\nThe film was produced by [[Michael G. Wilson]] and [[Barbara Broccoli]], and was the first Bond film made after the death of producer [[Albert R. Broccoli]] (to whom it pays tribute in the end credits), and the last released under the [[United Artists]] label. Filming locations included France, Thailand, Germany, Mexico and the United Kingdom.\n\n''Tomorrow Never Dies'' performed well at the box office, grossing over $333 million worldwide, becoming the [[1997 in film|fourth-highest-grossing film of 1997]] and earning a [[Golden Globe]] nomination despite mixed reviews. While its performance at the U.S. box office surpassed that of its predecessor ''[[GoldenEye]]'',<ref>[https://www.boxofficemojo.com/showdowns/chart/?id=jamesbondvs.htm \"James Bond Vs. Himself\"]. [[Box Office Mojo]]. Retrieved 1 January 2015.</ref> it was the only one of Brosnan's Bond films not to open at No. 1 at the box office, as it opened the same day as ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]'', and finished at No. 2 that week.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://boxofficemojo.com/weekend/chart/?yr=1997&wknd=51&p=.htm|title=Weekend Box Office Results for December 19-21, 1997 - Box Office Mojo|website=boxofficemojo.com}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n[[MI6]] sends [[James Bond (literary character)|James Bond]] into the field to [[Reconnaissance|reconnoiter]] a terrorist arms bazaar on the Russian border. Despite [[M (James Bond)|M]]'s insistence on letting 007 finish his reconnaissance, [[Royal Navy]] Admiral Roebuck orders the frigate [[HMS Chester|HMS ''Chester'']] to fire a [[RGM-84 Harpoon|Harpoon]] missile at the bazaar. Bond then discovers two nuclear torpedoes mounted on an [[Aero L-39 Albatros|L-39 Albatros]]; with the missile out of range to be aborted, Bond is forced to pilot the L-39 away seconds before the bazaar is destroyed.\n\n[[Media proprietor|Media baron]] Elliot Carver starts his plans to use an encoder obtained at the bazaar by his associate, [[cyberterrorism|cyberterrorist]] Henry Gupta, to provoke war between China and the UK. [[Meaconing]] the GPS signal using the encoder, Gupta sends the frigate [[HMS Devonshire|HMS ''Devonshire'']] off-course into Chinese-occupied waters in the [[South China Sea]], where Carver's [[stealth ship]], commanded by Mr. Stamper, ambushes and sinks it with a \"sea drill\" torpedo.  Carver's henchmen steal one of the ''Devonshire''<nowiki>'s</nowiki> missiles and shoot down a Chinese [[MiG]] fighter jet investigating the scene.  The henchmen kill the ''Devonshire''<nowiki>'s</nowiki> survivors with weaponry loaded with Chinese ammunition. The British [[Minister of Defence]] orders Roebuck to deploy the fleet to investigate the sinking of the frigate, and demands retaliation, leaving M only 48 hours to investigate its sinking and avert a war.\n\nM sends Bond to investigate Carver and his company, CMGN, after he released news articles about the crisis hours before MI6 had learned of it. Bond travels to [[Hamburg]] to seduce Carver's wife, Paris (an ex-girlfriend of Bond's), to get information that would help him enter CMGN headquarters. He defeats three of Stamper's men and cuts Carver off the air during the inaugural broadcast of his satellite network. Carver discovers the truth about Paris and Bond and orders both of them killed. Bond and Paris reconcile at Bond's hotel room, and she provides him with information to infiltrate Carver's newspaper factory. Bond steals the GPS encoder from Gupta's office at the factory; meanwhile, Carver's assassin Dr. Kaufman kills Paris. After Bond returns to find Paris's body, Kaufman attempts to shoot him. Bond is able to kill Kaufman and escape his henchmen through a multistory car park in his [[Q (James Bond)|Q-branch]] vehicle, a [[BMW 750iL]] with [[remote control]].\n\nAt a [[United States Air Force|U.S. Air Force]] base in [[Okinawa Prefecture|Okinawa]], Bond learns that the encoder had been tampered with, and goes to the South China Sea to investigate the wreck. He and [[Wai Lin]], a Chinese [[Ministry of State Security of the People's Republic of China|Ministry of State Security]] agent on the same case, explore the sunken ship and discover one of its cruise missiles missing, but after reaching the surface they are captured by Stamper and taken to the CMGN tower in [[Saigon]]. They soon escape and contact the [[Royal Navy]] and the [[People's Liberation Army Air Force]] to explain Carver's scheme. Carver plans to destroy most of the Chinese government with the stolen missile, allowing a corrupt Chinese general to negotiate a truce between Britain and China, both of which will have begun a naval war. Once the conflict is over, Carver will be given exclusive broadcasting rights in China for the next century.\n\nBond and Wai Lin board Carver's stealth ship to prevent him from firing the missile at Beijing; Wai Lin is captured, forcing Bond to devise a second plan. Bond captures Gupta to use as his own hostage, but Carver kills Gupta, claiming he has \"outlived his contract\". Bond detonates an explosive, damaging the ship and rendering it visible to radar, and vulnerable to a subsequent Royal Navy attack. While Wai Lin disables the engines, she is recaptured by Stamper. Bond kills Carver with his own sea drill and attempts to destroy the warhead with detonators, but Stamper attacks him, and sends a chained Wai Lin into the water. Bond traps Stamper in the missile firing mechanism and saves Wai Lin as the missile explodes, destroying the ship and killing Stamper. Bond and Wai Lin share a romantic moment amidst the wreckage as [[HMS Bedford|HMS ''Bedford'']] searches for them.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Pierce Brosnan]] as [[James Bond filmography|James Bond]], MI6 agent 007.\n<!-- opening title cards -->\n* [[Jonathan Pryce]] as Elliot Carver, a media mogul.\n* [[Michelle Yeoh]] as [[Wai Lin]], a skilled agent of the Chinese [[Ministry of State Security (China)|Ministry of State Security]], Bond's ally.\n* [[Teri Hatcher]] as Paris Carver, a former girlfriend of Bond who is now Carver's [[trophy wife]].\n* [[G\u00f6tz Otto]] as Richard Stamper, Carver's henchman, skilled in the art of [[Chakra]] torture.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://whatculture.com/film/20-things-you-didn-t-know-about-tomorrow-never-dies-1997?page=11|title=20 Things You Didn't Know About Tomorrow Never Dies (1997)|date=7 February 2021}}</ref>\n* [[Ricky Jay]] as Henry Gupta, an American \"techno-terrorist\" in the employ of Carver.\n* [[Joe Don Baker]] as [[Jack Wade (James Bond)|Jack Wade]], Bond's [[CIA]] liaison''.''\n* [[Vincent Schiavelli]] as Dr. Kaufman, a professional assassin used by Elliot Carver.\n* [[Judi Dench]] as [[M (James Bond)|M]], the head of MI6''.''\n* [[Desmond Llewelyn]] as [[Q (James Bond)|Q]], the head of MI6 Q-Branch.\n* [[Samantha Bond]] as [[Miss Moneypenny]], M's secretary.\n* [[Colin Salmon]] as [[Charles Robinson (James Bond)|Charles Robinson]], M's deputy chief of staff.\n* [[Geoffrey Palmer (actor)|Geoffrey Palmer]] as Admiral Roebuck, M's trigger-happy [[Royal Navy]] colleague\n}}\nOther actors in the film include [[Julian Fellowes]] as the British [[Minister of Defence]]; [[Cecilie Thomsen]] as Inga Bergstrom, an [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] professor Bond has an affair with; [[Nina Young]] as Tamara Steel, a news presenter for Carver Media Group; [[Colin Stinton]] as Dr. Dave Greenwalt, an [[United States Air Force|American Air Force]] expert on [[GPS]]; [[Michael Byrne (actor)|Michael Byrne]] as Admiral Kelly, commander of the [[Royal Navy]] task force sent to the South China Sea; [[Philip Kwok]] as General Chang, a corrupt Chinese military official who is helping Carver start a war between China and Britain; [[Terence Rigby]] as [[Russian army|Russian Army]] General Bukharin; [[Christopher Bowen]] as HMS ''Devonshire'' Commander Richard Day; [[Gerard Butler]] and [[Julian Rhind-Tutt]] as ''Devonshire'' crewmen; [[Hugh Bonneville]] as a ''Bedford'' crewman; and [[Daphne Deckers]] as a Carver Media Group PR representative.\n\n==Production==\n''Bond 18'' was greenlit after the positive public reception to the [[teaser trailer]] for ''GoldenEye'' in May 1995.{{sfn|Field|Chowdhury|2015|p=498}} Following ''[[GoldenEye]]''<nowiki/>'s success in reviving the Bond series, there was pressure to recreate that success in the next production.
