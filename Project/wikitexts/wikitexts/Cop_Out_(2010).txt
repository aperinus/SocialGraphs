The plot revolves around two veteran [[New York Police Department|NYPD]] partners (Willis and Morgan) on the trail of a stolen, rare, mint-condition baseball card who find themselves up against a memorabilia-obsessed gangster.\n\n''Cop Out'' was released on February 26, 2010, by [[Warner Bros. Pictures]]. It is Smith's highest-grossing film, earning $55 million on a $30 million budget, but earned negative reviews from critics.\n\n==Plot==\nJames \"Jimmy\" Monroe and Paul Hodges are [[New York Police Department|NYPD]] [[detectives]]. After failing to capture suspect Juan Diaz and endangering civilians, they are suspended without pay.\n\nJimmy's daughter Ava is getting married, and the wedding will cost close to $50,000. His ex-wife Pam's arrogant second husband Roy offers to pay for the wedding, but he is determined to come up with the money. While Jimmy is selling a 1952 [[baseball card]] to pay for the wedding, the shop is robbed by Dave, who takes the card. Finding out Dave is robbing a house that night, they stake it out to retrieve the card and gun. Jimmy and Paul arrest him, but the card and gun were sold.\n\nJimmy and Paul go to the [[drug dealer]], Poh Boy, who tells them if they retrieve a [[Car theft|stolen car]] they can have it. They discover a woman named Gabriela in the trunk. She was the mistress of a [[drug lord]] kidnapped and murdered by Poh Boy's gang. Jimmy previews the tape from Paul's hidden camera and sees what looks to be Paul's wife Debbie with another man, but he tells Paul there is nothing on it. Paul later sees it and is heartbroken. As she does not want to get Jimmy and Paul hurt, Gabriela flees.\n\nJimmy bails out Dave so he can retrieve the card, but he falls out of a tree and hits his head hard. Jimmy breaks into the house to retrieve the card but is surrounded by the gang. At the same time, Paul learns that Debbie tricked him by faking an affair for not trusting her. After killing most of the gang, Jimmy and Paul find Poh Boy holding Gabriela at gunpoint. They shoot him dead, but Paul's bullet goes through Jimmy's baseball card, in Poh Boy's shirt pocket. Pleased with the duo's investigation and assisting two colleagues who were caught in the shootout, the precinct chief restores Jimmy and Paul to active duty, giving them commendations.\n\nCrestfallen at the destruction of his prize card, Jimmy lets Roy pay for the wedding. Pam asks Jimmy and Roy to give away Ava together. Jimmy says nothing about it. Paul discreetly points his pistol at Roy and orders him to sit down at the moment the priest calls out for who is giving away Ava.\n\nIn a [[post-credits scene]], a female morgue worker rolls a gurney holding a body bag into the room as the phone rings. Dave emerges from the body bag, very much alive, and answers the phone.\n\n==Cast==\n{{multiple image\n| footer    = Actors [[Bruce Willis]] {{small|(left)}} and [[Tracy Morgan]] {{small|(right)}}\n| total_width     = 300\n| direction = horizontal\n| image1    = Bruce Willis by Gage Skidmore 3.jpg\n| alt1      =\n| image2    = Tracy Morgan Shankbone 2009 NYC.jpg\n| alt2      =\n}}\n* [[Bruce Willis]] as Detective Jimmy Monroe\n* [[Tracy Morgan]] as Detective Paul Hodges\n* [[Adam Brody]] as Barry Mangold\n* [[Kevin Pollak]] as Hunsaker\n* [[Guillermo D\u00edaz (actor)|Guillermo Diaz]] as Poh Boy\n* [[Seann William Scott]] as Dave\n* Sean Cullen as Captain Jack Romans\n* [[Jason Lee (actor)|Jason Lee]] as Roy\n* [[Rashida Jones]] as Debbie Hodges\n* [[Adrian Martinez (actor)|Adrian Martinez]] as Tino\n* Cory Fernandez as Juan Diaz\n* [[Michelle Trachtenberg]] as Ava Monroe\n* [[Francie Swift]] as Pam\n* [[Ana de la Reguera]] as Gabriela\n* [[Jim Norton (comedian)|Jim Norton]] as George\n* Marcus I.
