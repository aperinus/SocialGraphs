It also features [[John Rhys-Davies]], [[Alyssa Milano]], and [[Spalding Gray]] in supporting roles. The plot concerns five college housemates in [[Santa Cruz, California]] who are facing graduation and make an attempt to prolong their carefree lifestyle before going their separate ways. [[Matthew McConaughey]], [[Meredith Salenger]], [[Matt Damon]], [[Brendan Fraser]], and [[Leah Remini]] all appear in minor roles. Music for the film was composed and selected by members of the [[punk rock]] band [[The Vandals]], and the soundtrack features several punk rock bands of the era.\n\n==Plot==\n[[File:Santa Cruz, California - Boardwalk.jpg|thumb|A scene early in the film was shot at the [[Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk]], with the actors riding various attractions.]]\n22 year-old Jack Freeman is graduating from the [[University of California, Santa Cruz]] with a degree in art, and is hurting from a recent breakup with his ex-girlfriend Dina. He shares a house called \"El Rancho\" with four friends: Rob is also graduating, and preparing to move to Los Angeles with his girlfriend Joanie, though he is worried about settling down and living so close to Joani's mother. Dennis is a [[perpetual student]] with three degrees who, after six years at UCSC, is moving on to an [[Master of Business Administration|MBA]] program in Michigan. Mickey is a [[cartoonist]] with a year of college still to go, and has feelings for their friend Chelsea but is too shy to reciprocate her affections. Josh, aka \"Slosh\", had a promising academic future but failed out of college in favor of a life of drinking and working a series of menial jobs.\n\nArt professor Luther criticizes Jack's final sculpture project for expressing an uninteresting, suburban, middle-class worldview, but praises Dennis' thesis\u2014a [[photo-essay]] of Slosh getting drunk and working at dead-end jobs\u2014and offers him an [[apprenticeship]]; Jack suggests that this is only because Luther has a homosexual attraction toward Dennis, a notion Dennis dismisses. Not wanting their college days to end, Jack convinces his friends to postpone their respective plans and stay at El Rancho for another year. They celebrate the decision by throwing a party, at which Chelsea, tired of her feelings for Mickey going unrequited, makes sexual advances toward Jack. He turns her down, and she leaves the party embarrassed. Rob gets into an argument with Joanie, causing her to leave angrily.\n\nAfter the commencement ceremony the next day, Rob reconciles with Joanie and meets her mother, and they end up getting along. Jack argues with his parents over his future, and they leave abruptly. Jack encourages Mickey to pursue a relationship with Chelsea. Luther makes a pass at Dennis during a faculty luncheon, confirming Jack's suspicion about his ulterior motives. Dennis and Jack vent their frustrations with Luther by cutting down a [[totem pole]] that his sculpture students spent two semesters creating.\n\nAt a beach bonfire that night, Slosh tells Jack that it was Jack's carefree attitude that inspired him to give up on college, and that he does not regret his decision because he no longer fears what the future may hold. At Slosh's encouragement, Jack attempts to win back Dina, but she rebuffs him. Back at El Rancho, Mickey admits his feelings to Chelsea, and the two share a kiss. Jack and the others realize that they should not really stay another year, that it is time to move on with their adult lives. To preserve their memories of the house and prevent any future residents from despoiling it, they proceed to smash their furniture and belongings, culminating in the destruction of the [[Bar (establishment)#Bar (counter)|bar counter]] that they had built together.\n\nThe next day, the five friends go their separate ways: Rob leaves for Los Angeles with Joanie, Dennis heads off to school in Michigan, and Mickey and Chelsea begin dating. Slosh moves in with a group of new students he has befriended, and hangs the El Rancho sign on their house. As Jack leaves town, he stops at a restaurant where Dina is eating with her new boyfriend, and writes \"angst for the memories\" on the window as a farewell message to her.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Ben Affleck]] as Jack Freeman, the film's main character, who is graduating from the [[University of California, Santa Cruz]] and lives at \"El Rancho\" with his friends\n*[[Sam Rockwell]] as Rob, one of the El Rancho housemates, who is also graduating\n*[[Megan Ward]] as Joanie, Rob's girlfriend, also graduating\n*[[French Stewart]] as Dennis, an El Rancho housemate and [[perpetual student]] who has spent six years in college and earned three degrees\n*[[Kristin Bauer van Straten|Kristin Bauer]] as Dina, Jack's ex-girlfriend\n*Vinnie DeRamus as Mickey, an El Rancho housemate and [[cartoonist]] for the local newspaper\n*Vien Hong as Josh, nicknamed \"Slosh\", an El Rancho housemate and college dropout\n*[[Mary Woronov]] as Vicki, Joanie's mother\n*Elizabeth Ruscio as Jack's mother\n*[[John Rhys-Davies]] as Luther, an art professor who Jack and Dennis study under\n*[[Alyssa Milano]] as Chelsea, a friend of the El Rancho gang who has a crush on Mickey\n*[[Spalding Gray]] as Jack's father\n\nAffleck, Rockwell, Ward, and Stewart received top [[billing (filmmaking)|billing]] for the film, both in the billing block and opening credits, while Rhys-Davies, Milano, and Gray are listed as \"special appearances\". The theatrical [[film poster]], however, advertised Affleck, Milano, and Stewart as the film's stars. [[Meredith Salenger]] is also credited with a \"special appearance\" as a fan of Mickey's comic strip. Several actors who later became stars in their own right had small roles in ''Glory Daze'', including [[Matthew McConaughey]] as a rental truck salesman, [[Matt Damon]] in a non-speaking role as former El Rancho housemate Edgar Pudwhacker, and [[Brendan Fraser]] and [[Leah Remini]] as a couple who Jack argues with on a bus. Other small roles were played by Sean Whalen as a flunky, [[Jay Lacopo]] as the bus driver, and [[Alfred Sole]] as a fisherman.\n\n==Music==\n[[File:Warren Fitzgerald and Joe Escalante of The Vandals.jpg|thumb|Warren Fitgerald (left) of The Vandals composed the score for ''Glory Daze''. His bandmate Joe Escalante (right) supervised the music. They released the soundtrack album through their record label, Kung Fu Records.]]\nThe musical score for the film's [[soundtrack]] was composed by [[Warren Fitzgerald]], guitarist of the [[punk rock]] band [[The Vandals]]. Vandals bassist [[Joe Escalante]] served as music supervisor, along with [[Lia Vollack]]. The Vandals performed original music for the [[film score]], including the \"Theme from ''Glory Daze''\" which plays during the opening credits. \"It's a Fact\", from their then-upcoming album ''[[The Quickening (The Vandals album)|The Quickening]]'', was included, and a [[music video]] was later released for the song featuring clips from the film. The soundtrack also features several other contemporary punk rock bands, mostly from California, including [[NOFX]], [[Bad Religion]], [[Tilt (American band)|Tilt]], [[The Mr. T Experience]], [[Assorted Jelly Beans]], [[The Bouncing Souls]], and the [[New Bomb Turks]].\n\nMembers of the cast and crew also contributed to the soundtrack. The song \"Sports Pack\" is sung by Vinnie DeRamus, who played Mickey, with writer and director [[Rich Wilkes]] on drums along with bassist Scott Marcano and a guitarist credited as \"Gold\"; for the [[soundtrack album]] they used the group name Epoxy. In the film's party scene, the El Rancho housemates' band perform two songs: The \"Dudes of Steel Theme\" with Rob singing, and a [[cover version]] of The Mr. T Experience's \"Now We Are Twenty-One\" with Slosh singing. Sam Rockwell and Vien Hong sang their respective characters' parts on these tracks (DeRamus also sang backing vocals on \"Now We Are Twenty-One\"), while the music was performed by [[Daniel Rey]], [[Roger Murdock (musician)|Roger Murdock]], and John Connor.\n\n===Soundtrack album===\n{{Infobox album\n| name       = Glory Daze: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack\n| type       = soundtrack\n| artist     =\n| cover      = Glory Daze soundtrack cover.jpg\n| alt        =\n| released   = {{Start date|1996|09|17}}\n| recorded   =\n| venue      =\n| studio     =\n| genre      = [[Punk rock]], [[ska]]\n| length     =\n| label      = [[Kung Fu Records|Kung Fu]] (78761)\n| producer   =\n| prev_title =\n| prev_year  =\n| next_title =\n| next_year  =\n}}\n\nThe soundtrack album for ''Glory Daze'' was released by [[Kung Fu Records]], Escalante and Fitzgerald's recently launched [[independent record label]]. The album includes two songs not used in the film: \"Joe Lies (When He Cries)\" by The Bouncing Souls, and the previously-unreleased Vandals song \"Change the World with My Hockey Stick\". Also, rather than the original Bad Religion version of \"[[We're Only Gonna Die]]\" used in the film, the album substitutes a live recording of a cover version performed by [[Sublime (band)|Sublime]]. Other songs used in the film but not included on the soundtrack album include \"Kill All the White Man\" by NOFX, \"Clown Show\" by [[Ednaswap]], \"She Ballin{{' \"}} by Chappie Chap, and \"Acetone\" by [[Mudhoney]].\n\n====Track listing====\n{{Track listing\n| extra_column    = Artist\n| total_length    = \n| title1          = Theme from ''Glory Daze''\n| writer1         = [[Warren Fitzgerald]]\n| extra1          = [[The Vandals]]\n| length1         = 1:26\n| title2          = It's a Fact\n| note2           = from ''[[The Quickening (The Vandals album)|The Quickening]]'', 1996\n| writer2         = Fitzgerald\n| extra2          = The Vandals\n| length2         = 2:05\n| title3          = Change the World with My Hockey Stick\n| writer3         = Fitzgerald\n| extra3          = The Vandals\n| length3         = 2:24\n| title4          = Here We Go\n| note4           = from ''[[Maniacal Laughter]]'', 1996\n| writer4         = Pete Steinkopf, Shal Khichi, Bryan Keinlen, Greg Attonito\n| extra4          = [[The Bouncing Souls]]\n| length4         = 1:59\n| title5          = Joe Lies (When He Cries)\n| note5           = from ''[[The Argyle E.P.]]'', 1993\n| writer5         = Steinkopf, Khichi, Keinlen, Attonito\n| extra5          = The Bouncing Souls\n| length5         = 3:51\n| title6          = I Just Wanna Do It with You\n| note6           = from ''[[Love Is Dead (The Mr. T Experience album)|Love Is Dead]]'', 1996\n| writer6         = [[Frank Portman]]\n| extra6          = [[The Mr. T Experience]]\n| length6         = 1:59\n| title7          = Please Stop Fucking My Mom\n| note7           = from ''[[Fuck the Kids]]'', 1996\n| writer7         = [[Fat Mike]]\n| extra7          = [[NOFX]]\n| length7         = 1:00\n| title8          = Even Hitler Had a Girlfriend\n| note8           = from ''[[Our Bodies Our Selves]]'', 1993\n| writer8         = Portman\n| extra8          = The Mr. T Experience\n| length8         = 2:27\n| title9          = Brain Dead\n| note9           = from ''[[Assorted Jelly Beans (album)|Assorted Jelly Beans]]'', 1996\n| writer9         = [[Richard Falomir]], Ricky Boyer, Wylie Johnson\n| extra9          = [[Assorted Jelly Beans]]\n| length9         = 2:39\n| title10         = Sports Pack\n| extra10         = Epoxy\n| writer10        = [[Rich Wilkes]], Scott Marcano\n| length10        = 1:29\n| title11         = Country Time\n| note11          = from ''Scientific'', 1996\n| extra11         = [[Hepcat (band)|Hepcat]]\n| writer11        = Deston Berry\n| length11        = 3:17\n| title12         = Crying Jag\n| note12          = from ''[[Play Cell]]'', 1993\n| writer12        = [[Cinder Block (musician)|Cinder Block]], Jeffrey Bischoff, Vincent Camacho, Pete Rypins\n| extra12         = [[Tilt (American band)|Tilt]]\n| length12        = 2:27\n| title13         = Baby\n| note13          = from ''The Billy Nayer Show'', 1994\n| writer13        = [[Cory McAbee]]\n| extra13         = [[Billy Nayer Show|The Billy Nayer Show]]\n| length13        = 1:34\n| title14         = Runnin' on Go\n| note14          = from ''[[!!Destroy-Oh-Boy!!]]'', 1993\n| writer14        = Eric Davidson, Jim Weber, Matt Reber, Bill Randt\n| extra14         = [[New Bomb Turks]]\n| length14        = 2:10\n| title15         = The Moron Brothers\n| note15          = from ''[[Ribbed]]'', 1991\n| writer15        = Fat Mike\n| extra15         = NOFX\n| length15        = 2:27\n| title16         = Berkeley Pier\n| note16          = from '''[['Til It Kills]]'', 1995\n| writer16        = Block, Bischoff, Camacho, Gabe Meline\n| extra16         = Tilt\n| length16        = 3:45\n| title17         = [[We're Only Gonna Die]]\n| note17          = live; originally performed by [[Bad Religion]]\n| writer17        = [[Greg Graffin]]\n| extra17         = [[Sublime (band)|Sublime]]\n| length17        = 3:20\n}}\n\n==Reception==\nReviewing the film in November 1995, when it was titled ''Last Call'', ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' senior critic [[Emanuel Levy]] criticized Wilkes' direction as \"awkward, lacking any visual flair\" and said that \"the movie makes its funny points early on, which means the second half is basically an elaboration. If the loose, anecdotal pic sometimes rambles and loses its main line, eventually it rights itself, with enough inventiveness and fresh, nasty humor to compensate for the dull moments.\"<ref name=\"Levy\">{{cite web |last=Levy |first=Emanuel |authorlink=Emanuel Levy |title=Review: ''Last Call'' |date=1995-11-05 |publisher=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |work=variety.com |url=https://variety.com/1995/film/reviews/last-call-3-1117910374/ |accessdate=2015-11-21}}</ref> Upon its theatrical release, [[Stephen Holden]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' gave ''Glory Daze'' a positive review, saying \"This tiny nostalgic comedy, with its smart collegiate chatter, is a much better movie than slick fatuities like ''[[The Jerky Boys: The Movie|The Jerky Boys]]'' (1995), ''[[Airheads]]'' (1994), and ''[[Billy Madison]]'' (1995), for which Mr. Wilkes wrote the screenplays. Of course that isn't saying much. But ''Glory Daze'' deftly sketches each member of its underachieving fivesome while sustaining a mood of humorously frazzled end-of-semester anxiety [...] Mr. Affleck's affably mopey performance finds just the right balance between obnoxious and sad sack.

Jack's professor (John Rhys-Davies) tells him Jack's project has gotten 'lost in abstractionism'. 'Real art is subject to a complex filtration system', he goes on.
