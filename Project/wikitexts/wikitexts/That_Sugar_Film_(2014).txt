The film looks at hidden sugar in foods and the [[Sugar#Health effects|effect]] it can have on the human body.\n\n==Plot==\n\nThe film follows Gameau's experiment on himself, changing from his normal diet containing no refined sugar to a 'health-conscious' diet low in fat but high in sugar, equivalent to 160 grams (40 tsp) of sugar per day. As a result, Gameau gained weight, grew lethargic, and developed [[fatty liver disease]].<ref name=\"slate\">{{cite web |url=http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/medical_examiner/2015/08/that_sugar_film_science_debunking_links_to_mood_health_fatty_liver_disease.html |title=That *#^% Sugar Film |work=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]] |date=10 August 2015 |first=Daniel |last=Engber |accessdate=28 October 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/foodanddrink/healthyeating/11691125/I-ate-40-teaspoons-of-sugar-a-day.-This-is-what-happened.html |title=I ate 40 teaspoons of sugar a day. This is what happened |work=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]] |date=27 June 2015 |first=Damon |last=Gameau |accessdate=28 October 2016}}</ref> The sugar diet was selected such that his calorie intake was not increased from his normal diet.\n\nInterviews with experts attribute this change to the high level of sugar he was ingesting, and in particular suggest that [[fructose]] may be the main culprit. It is suggested that [[artificial sweetener]]s may be no better.\n\nThe viewers are introduced to the \"[[Bliss point (food)|bliss point]]\", a term coined in the 1960s which applies here to the amount of sugar you can add to a food to make it optimally desirable.  Adding more sugar beyond the \"bliss point\" leads to a significant drop in desirability.\n\nFollowing the experiment, he returned to his previous diet, and the ill effects were largely and quickly reversed.\n\n==Cast==\n\nIn addition to Gameau in the lead, the cast includes [[Hugh Jackman]], [[Stephen Fry]], [[Isabel Lucas]], and [[Brenton Thwaites]]. [[Gary Taubes]], [[Michael Moss]] and Dr. Kimber Stanhope gave interviews which are included, and [[Depeche Mode]], [[Peter Gabriel]] and [[Florence and the Machine]] feature on the soundtrack.  Gameau's partner, actress [[Zoe Tuckwell-Smith]], appears in the film while pregnant with their daughter, who makes an appearance after being born during production.\n\n==Reception ==\nAmerican reviews for the film were generally positive. According to a review by ''[[The New York Times]]'', the \"breezy blend of computer imagery, musical numbers, sketches and offbeat field trips\" made \"the nutrition lessons easy to digest\".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/31/movies/review-in-that-sugar-film-a-bitter-truth.html?_r=1|title=Review: In 'That Sugar Film,' a Bitter Truth|work=[[The New York Times]] |date=30 July 2015 |first=Daniel |last=Gold |accessdate=28 October 2016}}</ref> ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' concluded that \"Gameau clearly has good intentions, and generally succeeds in sweetening a potentially bitter subject for easy public consumption.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/sugar-film-film-review-805594|title='That Sugar Film': Film Review|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |date=28 June 2015 |first=Stephen |last=Dalton |accessdate=28 October 2016}}</ref> However, a ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'' review insisted \"That Sugar Film is so highly processed, and so laden with chintzy, artificial arguments, that its many weaknesses are hidden from consumers.\"<ref name=\"slate\" />\n\nA local Australian review in ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'' claimed that the film is \"not rigorous enough to prove anything at all\".
