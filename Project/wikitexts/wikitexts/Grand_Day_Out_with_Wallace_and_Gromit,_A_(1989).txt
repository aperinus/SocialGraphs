As \"everybody knows [[The Moon is made of green cheese|the Moon is made of cheese]]\", they decide to build a rocket and fly to the Moon. Upon arrival, they begin sampling and gathering cheese, and encounter a coin-operated [[robot]]. Wallace inserts a [[Ten pence (British coin)|coin]], but nothing happens. After he and Gromit leave, the robot comes to life and gathers the dirty plates left at their picnic spot.\n\nThe robot discovers Wallace's skiing magazine, and yearns to travel to Earth to ski for itself. It repairs a broken piece of the Moon that Wallace had cut off, issues a parking ticket for the rocket, and becomes annoyed by an oil leakage from the craft. The robot sneaks up on Wallace and prepares to strike him, but the money Wallace inserted runs out, and it freezes. Wallace takes the robot's [[Baton (law enforcement)|baton]] as a souvenir, inserts another coin, and prepares to leave with Gromit and the cheese they have gathered.\n\nReturning to life, the robot realizes Wallace and Gromit can bring it to Earth, and follows them. Wallace panics, thinking that the robot is angry over the cheese he is taking with him, and he and Gromit retreat into the rocket. Unable to climb up the ladder, the robot cuts into the fuselage using a can opener. Upon entering the dark engine section of the rocket, it lights a match and accidentally ignites some fuel. The resultant explosion throws it off the rocket, and Wallace and Gromit lift off. Initially distraught at losing its chance to go to Earth, the robot fashions discarded rocket fuselage into skis, and skis across the lunar landscape. It waves goodbye to Wallace and Gromit as they return home.\n\n==Production==\n[[Nick Park]] started creating the film in 1982, as a graduation project for the [[National Film and Television School]]. In 1985, Aardman Animations took him on before he finished the piece, allowing him to work on it part-time while still being funded by the school. To make the film, Park wrote to [[William Harbutt]]'s company, requesting {{convert|1|LT|kg}} of [[Plasticine]].\n\nThe block he received had ten colours, one of which was called \"stone\"; this was used for Gromit. Park wanted to voice Gromit, but he realised the voice he had in mind&nbsp;\u2014 that of [[Peter Hawkins]]&nbsp;\u2014 would have been difficult to animate.<ref name=telegraph>{{cite news |first=Nigel |last=Farndale |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/3831833/Wallace-and-Gromit-one-man-and-his-dog.html |title=Wallace and Gromit: one man and his dog |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |date=18 December 2008 |access-date=18 December 2008}}</ref> For Wallace, Park offered [[Peter Sallis]] \u00a350 to voice the character, and the actor's acceptance greatly surprised the young animator.<ref>{{cite web |last=Manger |first=Warren |date=5 June 2017 |title=Peter Sallis dead aged 96 after decades as Clegg in Last of the Summer Wine and unlikely Hollywood success with Wallace & Gromit |url=http://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/peter-sallis-dead-wallace-voice-10565680 |work=[[Daily Mirror]] |access-date=18 August 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171108101905/http://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/peter-sallis-dead-wallace-voice-10565680 |archive-date=8 November 2017}}</ref>\n\nPark wanted Wallace to have a Lancastrian accent like his own, but Sallis could only do a Yorkshire voice. Inspired by how Sallis drew out the word \"cheese\", Park chose to give Wallace large cheeks. When Park called Sallis six years later to explain he had completed his film, Sallis swore in surprise.<ref name=\"telegraph\" />\n\nGromit was named after [[grommet]]s, because Park's brother, an electrician, often mentioned them, and Nick Park liked the sound of the word. Wallace was originally a postman named Jerry, but Park felt the name did not match well with Gromit. Park saw an overweight [[Labrador Retriever]] named Wallace, who belonged to an old woman boarding a bus in Preston. Park commented it was a \"funny name, a very northern name to give a dog\".<ref>{{cite news |first=Nigel |last=Kendall |date=20 December 2008 |title=Nick Park on Wallace and Gromit: A Matter of Loaf and Death |work=[[The Times]] |location=London |url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/tv_and_radio/article5320110.ece |url-status=dead |access-date=26 December 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110616212838/http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/tv_and_radio/article5320110.ece |archive-date=16 June 2011}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the book ''The World of Wallace and Gromit'', original plans were that the film would be forty minutes long, including a sequence where Wallace and Gromit would discover a [[fast food]] restaurant on the Moon. Regarding the original plot, Park said:{{Blockquote | style=font-size:100% | The original story was that Wallace and Gromit were going to go to the Moon and there were going to be a whole lot of characters there. One of them was a [[parking meter]] attendant, which was the only one that remained&nbsp;\u2014 the robot cooker character&nbsp;\u2014 but there were going to be aliens, and all sorts. There was going to be a [[McDonald's]] on the Moon, and it was going to be like a spoof ''[[Star Wars]]''.\n\nWallace was going to get thrown into [[prison]] and Gromit was going to have to get him out. By the time I came to Aardman, I had just started doing the Moon scene and somebody told me, \"It's going to take you another nine years if you do that scene!\" so I had to have a check with reality and cut that whole bit out. Somehow, I had to tie up the story on the Moon and finish the film.<ref>{{cite book |first=Andy |last=Lane |title=The World of Wallace and Gromit |year=2004 |publisher=BoxTree |page=53 |isbn=978-0-75221-558-7}}</ref>}}\n\n==Home media==\nThe short film was released on VHS in the 1990s by BBC Video. It was also released on [[DVD]] in ''Wallace and Gromit in 3 Amazing Adventures'' in 2005 by [[DreamWorks Pictures|DreamWorks Home Entertainment]]. In the United States, it was released on DVD in 2009 by [[Lionsgate Home Entertainment]] and [[HIT Entertainment]].
