Originally broadcast on 1 January 1995 on the [[BBC]], it was Schlesinger's final film shot in his home country of Britain, and was picked up for [[theatrical release]] in [[North America]] through [[Gramercy Pictures]], where it was a small success.\n\n==Plot==\n{{More plot|reason=how does it end? [[WP:FILMPLOT]] 400-700 words|date= April 2022}}\nAfter the death of her parents, young Flora Poste goes to stay with her friend, the eccentric divorcee Mrs. Mary Small. Flora initially aspires to be a writer, deciding that the only way for her to live whilst researching her writing is to stay one of her many \u201cdreadful\u201d relatives. Mary suggests anything else, including beekeeping.\n\nDue to her, relative lack of means, her city-based relations show no interest.  Flora sends letters to her country relatives. While the smattering of responses are generally unsuitable, one is intriguing. Flora chooses to stay for a while with the Starkadder branch of the family on their rundown farm.\n\nThe Starkadders are an assortment of rustic, uncouth, truly eccentric, and quite possibly mad characters, all with a secret or not-so-secret hearts desire. Flora\u2019s desire is to find out what the ancient wrong which was \u201cdone to\u201d her father and what the resulting doom lays over the Starkadder farm.\n\nShe finds out that her cousin Judith, is morose and depressed while Judith\u2019s husband, Amos, wants to be the leader of his own, somewhat \u201cPentecostal\u201d religion, the Quivering Brethren. But believing himself responsible for the farm, and shunning vanity, he makes everyone else unhappy. Meanwhile the brothers Seth and Amos fear Flora\u2019s influence and believe she\u2019s come to take the farm away from them. \n\nFlora quickly realises that, as a sensible, modern woman, she has the ability to assess, coax and organise each person into solving their own problems.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Kate Beckinsale]] as Flora Poste\n* [[Joanna Lumley]] as Mrs. Mary Smiling\n* [[Ian McKellen]] as Amos Starkadder\n* [[Rufus Sewell]] as Seth Starkadder\n* [[Eileen Atkins]] as Judith Starkadder\n* [[Sheila Burrell]] as Ada Doom\n* [[Stephen Fry]] as Mybug\n* [[Freddie Jones]] as Adam Lambsbreath\n* [[Miriam Margolyes]] as Mrs. Beetle\n* [[Ivan Kaye]] as Reuben Starkadder\n* Jeremy Peters as Urk\n* Maria Miles as Elfine Starkadder\n* [[Christopher Bowen]] as Charles Fairford\n* Louise Rea as Meriam Beetle\n* Sophie Revell as Rennet\n* [[Rupert Penry-Jones]] as Dick Hawk-Monitor\n* [[Angela Thorne]] as Mrs. Hawk-Monitor\n* Harry Ditson as Earl P.
