Produced by [[Marvel Studios]] and distributed by [[Paramount Pictures]],{{refn|name=Distributor|group=N|In July 2013, the film's distribution rights were transferred from [[Paramount Pictures]] to [[Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures]].<ref name=\"Note\" /><ref name=\"Note2\" /><ref name=\"Note3\" />}} it is [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe films|the first film]] in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU). Directed by [[Jon Favreau]] from a screenplay by the writing teams of [[Mark Fergus and Hawk Ostby]], and [[Art Marcum and Matt Holloway]], the film stars [[Robert Downey Jr.]] as [[Tony Stark (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Tony Stark / Iron Man]] alongside [[Terrence Howard]], [[Jeff Bridges]], [[Shaun Toub]], and [[Gwyneth Paltrow]]. In the film, following his escape from captivity by a terrorist group, world famous industrialist and master engineer Tony Stark builds a [[Iron Man's armor (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|mechanized suit of armor]] and becomes the superhero Iron Man.\n\nA film featuring the character was in development at [[Universal Pictures]], [[20th Century Fox]], and [[New Line Cinema]] at various times since 1990, before Marvel Studios reacquired the rights in 2005. Marvel put the project in production as its first self-financed film, with Paramount Pictures distributing. Favreau signed on as director in April 2006, and faced opposition from Marvel when trying to cast Downey in the title role; the actor was signed in September. Filming took place from March to June 2007, primarily in California to differentiate the film from numerous other superhero stories that are set in New York City-esque environments. During filming, the actors were free to create their own dialogue because pre-production was focused on the story and action. Rubber and metal versions of the armor, created by [[Stan Winston]]'s company, were mixed with [[computer-generated imagery]] to create the title character.\n\n''Iron Man'' premiered in Sydney on April 14, 2008, and was released in the United States on May 2, as the first film in [[Marvel Cinematic Universe: Phase One|Phase One]] of the MCU. It grossed over $585 million, becoming the [[2008 in film#Highest-grossing films|eighth-highest grossing film of 2008]]. The film received praise from critics, especially for Downey's performance, as well as Favreau's direction, visual effects, action sequences, and writing. It was selected by the [[American Film Institute]] as one of the ten best films of 2008 and received two nominations at the [[81st Academy Awards]] for [[Academy Award for Best Sound Editing|Best Sound Editing]] and [[Academy Award for Best Visual Effects|Best Visual Effects]]. Two sequels have been released: ''[[Iron Man 2]]'' (2010) and ''[[Iron Man 3]]'' (2013).\n\n==Plot==\n[[Tony Stark (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Tony Stark]], who has inherited the defense contractor [[Stark Industries (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Stark Industries]] from his late father [[Howard Stark (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Howard Stark]], is in [[War in Afghanistan (2001\u20132021)|war-torn Afghanistan]] with his friend and military liaison, [[Lieutenant colonel]] [[James Rhodes (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|James Rhodes]], to demonstrate the new \"Jericho\" missile. After the demonstration, the convoy is ambushed and Stark is critically wounded by a missile used by the attackers: one of his company's own. He is captured and imprisoned in a cave by a terrorist group called the [[Ten Rings (organization)|Ten Rings]]. [[Ho Yinsen (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Yinsen]], a fellow captive doctor, implants an electromagnet into Stark's chest to keep the shrapnel shards that wounded him from reaching his heart and killing him. Ten Rings leader [[Raza (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Raza]] offers Stark freedom in exchange for building a Jericho missile for the group, but he and Yinsen know that Raza will not keep his word.\n\nStark and Yinsen secretly build a small, powerful electric generator called an [[Arc Reactor (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|arc reactor]] to power Stark's electromagnet and a prototype [[Iron Man's armor (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|suit of powered armor]] to aid in their escape. Although they keep the suit hidden almost to completion, the Ten Rings discover their hostages' intentions and attack the workshop. Yinsen sacrifices himself to divert them while the suit powers up. The armored Stark battles his way out of the cave to find the dying Yinsen, then burns the Ten Rings' weapons and flies away, crashing in the desert and destroying the suit. After being rescued by Rhodes, Stark returns home and announces that his company will cease manufacturing weapons. [[Obadiah Stane (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Obadiah Stane]], his father's old partner and the company's manager, advises Stark that this may ruin Stark Industries and his father's legacy. In his home workshop, Stark builds a sleeker, more powerful version of his improvised armor suit as well as a more powerful arc reactor for it and his chest. Personal assistant [[Pepper Potts (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Pepper Potts]] places the original reactor inside a small glass showcase. Though Stane requests details, a suspicious Stark decides to keep his work to himself.\n\nAt a charity event held by Stark Industries, reporter [[Christine Everhart (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Christine Everhart]] informs Stark that his company's weapons were recently delivered to the Ten Rings and are being used to attack Yinsen's home village, Gulmira. Stark dons his new armor and flies to Afghanistan, where he saves the villagers. While flying home, Stark is attacked by two [[F-22 Raptor]]s. He reveals his secret identity to Rhodes over the phone in an attempt to end the attack. Meanwhile, the Ten Rings gather the pieces of Stark's prototype suit and meet with Stane, who has been trafficking arms to the Ten Rings and has staged a [[coup]] to replace Stark as Stark Industries' CEO by hiring the Ten Rings to kill him. He subdues Raza and has the rest of the group killed. Stane has a massive new suit reverse engineered from the wreckage. Seeking to track his company's illegal shipments, Stark sends Potts to hack into its database. She discovers that Stane hired the Ten Rings to kill Stark, but the group reneged when they realized they had a direct route to Stark's weapons. Potts meets with Agent [[Phil Coulson]] of [[S.H.I.E.L.D. (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|S.H.I.E.L.D.]], an intelligence agency, to inform him of Stane's activities.\n\nStane's scientists cannot duplicate Stark's miniaturized arc reactor, so Stane ambushes Stark at his home and steals the one from his chest. Stark manages to get to his original reactor to replace it. Potts and several S.H.I.E.L.D. agents attempt to arrest Stane, but he dons his suit and attacks them. Stark fights Stane but is outmatched without his new reactor to run his suit at full capacity. The fight carries Stark and Stane to the top of the Stark Industries building, and Stark instructs Potts to overload the large arc reactor powering the building. This unleashes a massive electrical surge that causes Stane and his armor to fall into the exploding reactor, killing him. The next day, at a press conference, Stark publicly admits to being the superhero the press has dubbed \"Iron Man\".\n\nIn a [[post-credits scene]], S.H.I.E.L.D. Director [[Nick Fury (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Nick Fury]] visits Stark at home, telling him that Iron Man is not \"the only superhero in the world\", and explaining that he wants to discuss the \"[[Avengers Initiative (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Avenger Initiative]]\".\n\n==Cast==\n{{multiple image\n|align=right\n|width=170\n|direction=vertical\n|image1=Robert Downey Jr at Comic Con 2007.jpg\n|caption1=Downey promoting the film at the 2007 [[San Diego Comic-Con]]\n|image2=Terrence Howard, USAF.jpg\n|caption2=Howard preparing for the role by riding an [[F-16 Fighting Falcon|F-16]] flight simulator\n}}\n* [[Robert Downey Jr.]] as [[Tony Stark (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Tony Stark / Iron Man]]: <br />An [[industrialist]], genius inventor, and consummate playboy, he is CEO of [[Stark Industries]] and chief weapons manufacturer for the [[U.S. military]]. Director [[Jon Favreau]] felt that Downey's past made him an appropriate choice for the part<ref name=\"DowneyUSAToday\" /> and that the actor could not only make Stark a \"likable asshole,\" but also portray an authentic emotional journey, once he had won over the audience.<ref name=\"FavreauWonderCon2008\" /> Favreau was also attracted to Downey because of his performance in ''[[Kiss Kiss Bang Bang]].'' Downey frequently spoke with that film's director, [[Shane Black]], about the script and dialogue in ''Iron Man''.<ref name=\"KissKissBangBang\" /> Downey had an office next to Favreau during pre-production, which allowed him greater involvement in the screenwriting process,<ref name=\"EmpireJuly2007\" /> especially when it came to adding humor to the film.<ref name=\"EmpireApril2008\" /> Downey explained, \"What I usually hate about these [superhero] movies [is] when suddenly the guy that you were digging turns into [[Dudley Do-Right]], and then you're supposed to buy into all his 'Let's go do some good!' That [[Eliot Ness]]-in-a-cape-type thing. What was really important to me was to not have him change so much that he's unrecognizable. When someone used to be a schmuck and they're not anymore, hopefully they still have a sense of humor.\"<ref name=\"FavreauStarkQuote\" /> To get into shape, Downey spent five days a week weight training and practiced martial arts,<ref name=\"DowneyUSAToday\" /> which he said benefited him because \"it's hard not to have a personality meltdown ... after about several hours in that suit. I'm calling up every therapeutic moment I can think of to just get through the day.\"<ref name=\"pump\" />\n* [[Terrence Howard]] as [[James Rhodes (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|James \"Rhodey\" Rhodes]]: <br />A friend of Stark's and the liaison between Stark Industries and the [[United States Air Force]] in the department of acquisitions, specifically weapons development. Favreau cast Howard because he felt he could play [[War Machine]] in a sequel.<ref name=\"trilogy\" /> Howard prepared for the role by visiting [[Nellis Air Force Base]] on March 16, 2007, where he ate with the pilots and observed [[HH-60 Pave Hawk]] rescue helicopters and [[F-22 Raptor]]s.<ref name=\"HowardNellis\" /> While Rhodes is roguish in the comics after he meets Stark, his previous role as a disciplinarian creates a dynamic tension with Stark's character. He is unsure whether Stark's actions are acceptable. \"Rhodey is completely disgusted with the way Tony has lived his life, but at a certain point he realizes that perhaps there is a different way,\" Howard said. \"Whose life is the right way: Is it the strict military life, or the life of an independent?\"<ref name=\"pump\" /> Howard and his father are Iron Man fans, partly because Rhodes was one of the few black superheroes when Howard was a child.<ref name=\"RhodesFirst\" /> He has been a Downey fan since he saw him in ''[[Weird Science (film)|Weird Science]];'' the two competed physically on set.<ref name=\"HowardCompete\" />\n* [[Jeff Bridges]] as [[Obadiah Stane (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Obadiah Stane]]: <br />Stark's business second-in-command, mentor, and friend, who turns on him to take over the company, eventually building a giant exosuit to fight Stark. Bridges read the comics as a boy and liked Favreau's modern, realistic approach. He shaved his head, something he had wanted to do for some time, and grew a beard for the role. Bridges researched the [[Book of Obadiah]], and was surprised to learn retribution is a major theme in that book of the Bible, something that Stane represents.<ref name=\"ProductionNotes\" /> Many of Stane's scenes were cut to focus more on Stark, but the writers felt Bridges's performance allowed the application of \"less is more\" when editing the film.<ref name=\"BridgesCut\" />\n* [[Shaun Toub]] as [[Ho Yinsen (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Ho Yinsen]]: Stark's fellow captive, who grafts an electromagnet to Stark's chest \"to keep the shrapnel shell shards that wounded him from reaching his heart and killing him\" and helps Stark build the first Iron Man suit.<ref name=\"Toub\" /><ref name=\"Yinsen\" />\n* [[Gwyneth Paltrow]] as [[Pepper Potts (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Virginia \"Pepper\" Potts]]: <br />Stark's personal assistant and budding love interest. Paltrow asked Marvel to send her any comics they would consider relevant to her understanding of the character, whom she considered to be very smart, level-headed, and grounded. She said she liked \"the fact that there's a sexuality that's not blatant.\" Favreau wanted Potts' and Stark's relationship to be reminiscent of a 1940s comedy, something which Paltrow considered to be fun in an \"innocent yet sexy\" way.<ref name=\"Paltrow\" />\n\nAdditionally, [[Leslie Bibb]] portrays [[Christine Everhart (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Christine Everhart]], a reporter for ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'';<ref>{{cite web |title=LESLIE BIBB ADDED TO \"IRON MAN\" CAST; FIRST PIC ONLINE! |url=https://editorial.rottentomatoes.com/article/leslie-bibb-added-to-iron-man-cast-first-pic-online/ |access-date=October 7, 2022 |website=Rotten Tomatoes}}</ref> [[Faran Tahir]] appears as [[Raza (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Raza]], a high-ranking member of the [[Ten Rings (organization)|Ten Rings]]; and [[Clark Gregg]] appears as [[Phil Coulson]], an agent of [[S.H.I.E.L.D.

It included a new science-fiction origin for the character, and featured [[MODOK]] as the villain.

In May 1999, Jeffrey Caine was hired to rewrite Vintar and Lee's script.<ref name=\"archive\" /> That October, [[Quentin Tarantino]] was approached to write and direct the film.<ref name=\"Tarantino\" /> Fox sold the rights to [[New Line Cinema]] the following December, reasoning that although the Vintar/Lee script was strong, the studio had too many Marvel superheroes in development, and \"we can't make them all.\"<ref name=\"NewLine\" />\n\n{{quote box|width=33%|quote= We worked with [[Michael Crichton]]'s researchers to find a grounded realistic way to deal with the suit.

Goyer, and [[Mark Protosevich]] to \"sit in a room and simply talk on camera about Iron Man for a few days\". After this, Hayter was hired in 2004 to write a script.<ref name=\"HayterTHR\" /> He reworked scripts that had been written by Jeff Vintar and [[Alfred Gough]] and [[Miles Millar]], which had included the villain the [[Mandarin (character)|Mandarin]] and [[Pepper Potts]] as a love interest.<ref name=\"HayterTHR\" /><ref name=\"IGNNewLineNov2004\" /> Hayter removed the Mandarin and instead chose to pit Iron Man against his father [[Howard Stark]], who becomes [[War Machine]].

When the film did have a script, even the requests for rewrites met with many refusals.<ref name=\"MCUDocumentary\" /> Early scripts for the film also directly referenced [[Sony Pictures]]' ''[[Spider-Man 2]]'' (2004) by identifying Stark as the creator of [[Otto Octavius (film character)|Otto Octavius]]'s bionic arms.<ref name=\"DocOckArms\" /> In order to build the general public's awareness of Iron Man and elevate him to the same level of popularity as [[Spider-Man]] or [[Hulk]], Marvel conducted [[focus group]]s, trying to find a way to remove the general perception that the character is a robot. The information Marvel received from the focus groups was used to formulate an awareness-building plan, which included releasing three animated short films ahead of the film's release. The shorts were called \"Iron Man Advertorials\", and were produced by [[Tim Miller (director)|Tim Miller]] and [[Blur Studio]].<ref name=\"Adventorials\" />\n\n===Pre-production===\n[[Jon Favreau]] was hired to direct the film in April 2006,<ref name=\"FavreauMarcumHolloway\" /> celebrating getting the job by going on a diet, losing {{convert|70|lb|kg}}.<ref name=\"pump\" /> Favreau had wanted to work with Marvel producer [[Avi Arad]] on another film after they both worked on ''[[Daredevil (film)|Daredevil]]''.<ref name=\"EmpireJuly2007\" /> The director found the opportunity to create a politically ambitious \"ultimate spy movie\" in ''Iron Man'', citing inspiration from [[Tom Clancy]], [[James Bond]], and ''[[RoboCop]]'',<ref name=\"Inspiration\" /> and compared his approach to an independent film\u2014\"[i]f [[Robert Altman]] had directed ''[[Superman (1978 film)|Superman]]''\"\u2014and ''[[Batman Begins]]''.<ref name=\"EmpireJuly2007\" /><ref name=\"sauron\" /> Favreau wanted to make ''Iron Man'' a story of an adult man literally reinventing himself after discovering the world is far more complex than he originally believed.<ref name=\"FavreauWants\" /> He changed the [[Vietnam War]] origin of the character to Afghanistan, as he did not want to do a [[period piece]].<ref name=\"trilogy\" /> [[Art Marcum and Matt Holloway|Art Marcum & Matt Holloway]] were hired to write the script,<ref name=\"FavreauMarcumHolloway\" /> while [[Mark Fergus and Hawk Ostby|Mark Fergus & Hawk Ostby]] wrote another version, with Favreau compiling both teams' scripts,<ref name=\"FergusOstby\" /> and [[John August]] then \"polishing\" the combined version.<ref name=\"August\" /> Comic book staff [[Mark Millar]], [[Brian Michael Bendis]], [[Joe Quesada]], [[Tom Brevoort]], [[Axel Alonso]], and [[Ralph Macchio (comics)|Ralph Macchio]] were also called upon by Favreau to give advice on the script.<ref name=\"thinktank\" /> By July 2006, [[Matthew Libatique]] was attached to serve as cinematographer.<ref name=\"Libatique\" />\n\nFavreau planned to cast a newcomer in the title role, as \"those movies don't require an expensive star; Iron Man's the star, the superhero is the star.

Rockwell was interested, but Favreau changed his decision after the screen-test of [[Robert Downey, Jr.]] (Rockwell would later portray [[Justin Hammer]] in ''[[Iron Man 2]]'' (2010)).<ref name=\"RockwellAccepts\" /> In September 2006, Robert Downey, Jr. was cast in the role.<ref name=\"DowneyCast\" /> Favreau chose Downey, a fan of the comic,<ref name=\"DowneyUSAToday\" /> because he felt the actor's past made him an appropriate choice for the part, explaining \"The best and worst moments of Robert's life have been in the public eye. He had to find an inner balance to overcome obstacles that went far beyond his career. That's Tony Stark.\"<ref name=\"DowneyUSAToday\" /> Favreau faced opposition from Marvel in casting Downey, but would not take no for an answer, saying, \"It was my job as a director to show that it was the best choice creatively ... everybody knew he was talented [and] certainly by studying the Iron Man role and developing that script I realized that the character seemed to line-up with Robert in all the good and bad ways.\"<ref name=\"FavreauFight\" /> Downey earned $500,000 for the role.<ref name=\"DowneyPay\" /> While preparing for filming, Favreau and Downey were given a tour of SpaceX by [[Elon Musk]]. Downey said, \"Elon was someone Tony probably hung out with and partied with, or more likely they went on some weird jungle trek together to drink concoctions with the shamans.\"<ref name=\"Musk\" />\n\nAdditional casting for the film occurred over the next few months: [[Terrence Howard]] was announced in the role of Stark's best friend [[James Rhodes (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|James \"Rhodey\" Rhodes]] in October 2006;<ref name=\"HowardCast\" /> Gwyneth Paltrow was cast as love interest Virginia \"Pepper\" Potts in January 2007;<ref name=\"PaltrowCast\" /> and Jeff Bridges was cast in an undisclosed role in February.<ref name=\"BridgesCast\" /> [[Don Cheadle]] had also been approached for the role of Rhodes, and would eventually replace Howard in the role starting with the sequel, ''Iron Man 2''.<ref name=\"CheadleRhodes\" /> Choosing a character to be the villain of the film was difficult, as Favreau felt Iron Man's arch-nemesis the Mandarin would not feel realistic, especially after Mark Millar gave his opinion on the script.<ref name=\"thinktank\" /> The Mandarin had originally been envisioned as a rival to Tony Stark with a building of his own right next to [[Stark Industries (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Stark Industries]], with the Mandarin eventually drilling a hole underneath Stark Industries to steal all of Stark's technology for himself; associate producer Jeremy Latchman described such story as \"crazy terrible\" and \"underwhelming\".<ref name=\"The Story of Marvel Studios\" /> Favreau felt only in a sequel, with an altered tone, would the fantasy of the [[Mandarin's rings]] be appropriate.<ref name=\"mandarin\" /> The decision to push him into the background is comparable to [[Sauron]] in ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'',<ref name=\"sauron\" /> or [[Palpatine]] in ''[[Star Wars]]''.<ref name=\"mandarin\" /> Favreau also wanted Iron Man to face a giant enemy. The switch from Mandarin to Obadiah Stane was done after Bridges was cast in that role,<ref name=\"depth\" /> with Stane originally intended to become a villain in the sequel.<ref name=\"thinktank\" /> The [[Crimson Dynamo]] was also a villain in early drafts of the script.<ref name=\"EmpireApril2008\" /> Favreau felt it was important to include intentional [[in-joke|inside references]] for fans of the comics, such as giving the two fighter jets that attack Iron Man the [[call sign]]s of \"Whiplash 1\" and \"Whiplash 2\", a reference to the comic book villain [[Blacklash|Whiplash]], and including [[Captain America's shield]] in Stark's workshop.<ref name=\"EasterEggs\" />\n\n[[File:Iron Monger in Iron Man (2008 film).jpg|thumb|The scale model of the \"Iron Monger\" suit as seen in the film,<ref name=\"depth\" /> based on the larger animatronic version built by Stan Winston Studios.<ref name=\"ProductionNotes\" />]]\nFavreau wanted the film to be believable by showing the construction of the Iron Man suit in its three stages.<ref name=\"trilogy\" /> [[Stan Winston]], a fan of the comic book, and his company, who Favreau worked with on ''[[Zathura (film)|Zathura]]'', built metal and rubber versions of the armor.<ref name=\"ProductionNotes\" /> The Mark I design was intended to look like it was built from spare parts.

The armor was also designed to have only its top half worn at times.<ref name=\"ProductionNotes\" /> Stan Winston Studios built a {{convert|10|ft|adj=on|disp=flip}}, {{convert|800|lb|adj=on|disp=flip}} animatronic version of \"Iron Monger\" (Obadiah Stane),<ref name=\"ProductionNotes\" /> a name which Obadiah Stane calls Tony Stark and himself earlier in the film as a reference, but is never actually used for the suit itself in the film. The animatronic required five operators for the arm, and was built on a [[gimbal]] to simulate walking.<ref name=\"ProductionNotes\" /> A [[scale model]] was used for the shots of it being built.<ref name=\"depth\" /> The Mark II resembles an airplane prototype, with visible flaps.<ref name=\"depth\" /> Iron Man comic book artist [[Adi Granov]] designed the Mark III with illustrator [[Phil Saunders]].<ref name=\"GranovSaunders\" /> Granov's designs were the primary inspiration for the film's, and he came on board the film after he recognized his work on Jon Favreau's MySpace page.<ref name=\"sauron\" /> Saunders streamlined Granov's concept art, making it stealthier and less cartoonish in its proportions,<ref name=\"ProductionNotes\" /> and also designed the War Machine armor, but it was \"cut from the script about halfway through pre-production.\" He explained that the War Machine armor \"was going to be called the Mark IV armor and would have had weaponized swap-out parts that would be worn over the original Mark III armor,\" and that it \"would have been worn by Tony Stark in the final battle sequence.\"<ref name=\"WarMachine\" />\n\n===Filming===\nProduction was based in the former Hughes Company soundstages in [[Playa Vista, Los Angeles, California]].<ref name=\"PlayaVista\" /> [[Howard Hughes]] was one of the inspirations for the comic book, and the filmmakers acknowledged the coincidence that they would film Iron Man creating the flying Mark III where the [[Hughes H-4 Hercules]] was built.<ref name=\"ProductionNotes\" /> Favreau rejected the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] setting of the comic books because many superhero films had already been set there.<ref name=\"trilogy\" />\n\nFilming began on March 12, 2007,<ref name=\"FilmingBegins\" /> with [[Matthew Libatique]] serving as director of photography.<ref name=\"Libatique\" /> The first few weeks of filming were spent on Stark's captivity in Afghanistan.<ref name=\"FirstWeeks\" /> The cave where Stark is imprisoned was a {{convert|150|to(-)|200|yd|adj=on}} long set, which had movable forks in the caverns to allow greater freedom for the film's crew.<ref name=\"trilogy\" /> [[Production designer]] [[J. Michael Riva]] saw footage of a [[Taliban]] fighter in Afghanistan, and saw the cold breath as he spoke: realizing remote caves are actually very cold, Riva placed an air conditioning system in the set. He also sought Downey's advice about makeshift objects in prison, such as a sock being used to make tea.<ref name=\"ProductionNotes\" /> Afterwards, Stark's capture was filmed at [[Lone Pine, California|Lone Pine]], and other exterior scenes in Afghanistan were filmed at [[Olancha]] Sand Dunes, where the crew endured two days of {{convert|40|to(-)|60|mph|adj=on}} winds.<ref name=\"ProductionNotes\" /> Filming at [[Edwards Air Force Base]] began in mid-April,<ref name=\"EdwardsBegins\" /> and ended on May 2.<ref name=\"EdwardsEnds\" /> In return for production assistance, the [[United States Department of Defense]] consulted on the film regarding certain scenes and dialogue depicting the military.<ref name=\"USDoD\" /> This included changing Stark from being opposed to arms deals, to instead becoming one who sells his technology to the U.S. military.<ref name=\"GuardianUSDoD\" /> Exterior shots of Stark's home were digitally added to footage of [[Point Dume]] in [[Malibu, California|Malibu]],<ref name=\"depth\" /> while the interior was built at Playa Vista, where Favreau and Riva aimed to make Stark's home look less futuristic and more \"[[wikt:grease monkey|grease monkey]]\".<ref name=\"ProductionNotes\" /> Filming concluded on June 25, 2007, at [[Caesars Palace]] in [[Las Vegas, Nevada]].<ref name=\"FilmingEnds\" /> Favreau, a newcomer to action films, remarked, \"I'm shocked that I [was] on schedule. I thought that there were going to be many curveballs\". He hired \"people who are good at creating action\", so \"the human story [felt] like it belongs to the comic book genre\".<ref name=\"pump\" />\n\nThere was much improvisation in dialogue scenes, because the script was not completed when filming began (the filmmakers had focused on the story making sense and planning the action). Favreau felt that improvisation would make the film feel more natural. Some scenes were shot with two cameras to capture lines said on the spot. Multiple takes were done, as Downey wanted to try something new each time.<ref name=\"depth\" /> It was Downey's idea to have Stark hold a [[news conference]] on the floor,<ref name=\"pump\" /> and he created the speech Stark makes when demonstrating the Jericho weapon.<ref name=\"FavreauWonderCon2008\" /> Bridges described this approach as \"a $200&nbsp;million student film\", and noted that it caused stress for Marvel executives when the stars were trying to come up with dialogue on the day of filming scenes. He also noted that in some instances, he and Downey would swap characters for rehearsal to see how their own lines sounded.<ref name=\"BridgesImprovisation\" /> The crew conceived a [[post-credits scene]] featuring [[Nick Fury (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Nick Fury]] and called [[Samuel L. Jackson]] to ask him if he would be interest in playing Fury, as Jackson had learned a few years ago that his likeness had been used for Fury in the [[Ultimate Marvel]] imprint. However, according to Latchman, Jackson originally appeared without any deal for him to reappear in later movies: \"It was just this weird idea that maybe people give a shi-- if we stick it on the end\".<ref name=\"The Story of Marvel Studios\" /> The dialogue for the Nick Fury cameo scene was also changed on set, with comic writer [[Brian Michael Bendis]] providing three pages of dialogue for the part, and the filmmakers choosing the best lines for filming on set.<ref name=\"thinktank\" /> The Nick Fury cameo was filmed with a skeleton crew in order to keep it a secret, but rumors appeared on the Internet only days later. Marvel Studios President [[Kevin Feige]] subsequently had the scene removed from all preview prints in order to maintain the surprise and keep fans guessing.<ref name=\"CameoRemoved\" /> An alternate version of the Nick Fury post-credits scene was filmed in which he specifically said \"As if gamma accidents, radioactive bugs bites and assorted [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutants]] weren't enough\" referencing Hulk, Spider-Man and the [[X-Men]] but this was cut due to legal problems with Sony Pictures and [[20th Century Fox]] who at the time had full ownership of the characters until their reacquisition much later in the mid to late 2010s.<ref name=\"AltPostCredits\" />\n\n===Post-production===\nFavreau's main concern with the film's effects was whether the transition between the computer-generated and practical costumes would be too obvious.<ref name=\"FavreauEffectsConcerns\" /> He hired [[Industrial Light & Magic]] (ILM) to create the bulk of the visual effects for the film after seeing ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End]]'' and ''[[Transformers (film)|Transformers]]''. [[The Orphanage (company)|The Orphanage]] and [[The Embassy Visual Effects|The Embassy]] did additional work,<ref name=\"ProductionNotes\" /> with the latter creating a digital version of the Mark I armor.<ref name=\"Embassy\" /> To help with animating the more refined suits, information was sometimes captured by having Downey wear only the helmet, sleeves and chest of the costume over a [[motion capture]] suit,<ref name=\"ProductionNotes\" /> and skydivers were filmed in a vertical [[wind tunnel]] to study the physics of flying.<ref name=\"WindTunnel\" /> For shots of the Mark III flying, it was animated to look realistic by taking off slowly, and landing quickly. To generate shots of Iron Man and the F-22 Raptors battling, cameras were flown in the air to provide reference for physics, wind and frost on the lenses.<ref name=\"MarkIIIFlying\" />\n\n==Music==\n{{further|Iron Man (soundtrack)|Music of the Marvel Cinematic Universe}}\n\nComposer [[Ramin Djawadi]] had been a fan of the character [[Iron Man]] as a child, saying that he always liked superheroes \"that actually don't have any superpowers\". After Favreau's previous collaborator [[John Debney]] was unavailable to score the film,<ref name=\"DebneyIM1\" /> Djawadi sought out the role himself.<ref name=\"DjawadiComicus\" /> Favreau had a clear vision of [[heavy metal music]] and guitars for the project,<ref name=\"DjawadiComicus\" /> saying that Tony Stark was more of a rock star than a traditional superhero.<ref name=\"DjawadiDoG\" /> Djawadi subsequently composed most of the film's score on guitar, before arranging it for orchestra.<ref name=\"DjawadiComicus\" /> Djawadi had help with arrangements and additional cues from [[Hans Zimmer]] and [[Remote Control Productions (American company)|Remote Control Productions]],<ref name=\"DjawadiComicus\" /> and [[Rage Against the Machine]] guitarist [[Tom Morello]], who also makes a [[cameo appearance]] in the film, contributed guitar performances to the score.<ref name=\"Morello\" /> The film also features a [[big band]]-style arrangement of the Iron Man theme song from the 1966 cartoon ''[[The Marvel Super Heroes]]'' from frequent Favreau collaborators John O'Brien and [[Rick Boston]].<ref name=\"O\" /> A soundtrack featuring Djawadi's score was released by [[Lions Gate Entertainment|Lions Gate Records]] on April 29, 2008.<ref name=\"release\" />\n\n==Marketing==\n[[File:Robert Downey Jr-2008.JPG|thumb|upright|Downey promoting the film in [[Mexico City]]]]\n\nIn July 2006, with the film still in pre-production, Favreau and Arad attended [[San Diego Comic-Con]] to promote the film, where the film's armor design, drawn by [[Adi Granov]], was revealed along with the announcement that the Mandarin was intended to be the antagonist of the film. The following year, Favreau returned to San Diego Comic-Con to once again promote the film with Downey and Feige, where a teaser trailer was shown. With much of the visuals not yet ready, Favreau worked with ILM to have the flying shots ready, saying \"I knew that I had to make a splash because there was zero anticipation for the film at the time\".<ref name=\"FavreauComicConLookBack\" /> Stan Winston Studios also brought a life-sized replica of the film's armor to display at the convention.<ref name=\"THRComicConLookBack2022\" />\n\nMarvel and Paramount modeled their marketing campaign for ''Iron Man'' on that of ''Transformers''.<ref name=\"transformers\" /> In May 2008, [[Sega]] released an official tie-in [[Iron Man (video game)|video game based on the film]] on multiple gaming platforms. Downey, Howard and Toub reprise their roles from the film.<ref name=\"VideoGame\" /> A 30-second spot for the film aired during a [[Super Bowl XLII]] break.<ref name=\"SuperBowl\" /> [[Hasbro]] created figures of armor from the film, as well as [[Titanium Man]] (who appears in the video game) and the [[Hulkbuster Armor MK II|armor from the ''World War Hulk'' comics]].<ref name=\"Hasbro\" />\n\nThe [[7-Eleven]] convenience store chain helped promote the film across the United States, and [[LG Group]] also made a sponsorship deal with Paramount.<ref name=\"transformers\" /> Worldwide, [[Burger King]] and [[Audi]] promoted the film. Jon Favreau was set to direct a commercial for the fast-food chain, as [[Michael Bay]] did for ''Transformers''.<ref name=\"transformers\" /> In the film, Tony Stark drives an [[Audi R8 (road car)|Audi R8]], and also has an \"American cheeseburger\" from Burger King after his rescue from Afghanistan, as part of the studio's [[product placement]] deal with the respective companies. Three other vehicles, the [[Audi S6]] sedan, [[Audi A5|Audi S5]] sports coupe and the [[Audi Q7]] SUV, also appear in the film.<ref name=\"Audi\" /><ref name=\"Reuters\" /> Audi created a tie-in website, as [[General Motors]] did for ''Transformers''.<ref name=\"transformers\" /> [[Oracle Corporation]] also promoted the film on its site.<ref name=\"Oracle\" /> Several [[Marvel Cinematic Universe tie-in comics|tie-in comics]] were released for the film.<ref name=\"Comics\" />\n\n==Release==\n===Theatrical===\n''Iron Man'' premiered at the [[Greater Union]] theater at [[George Street, Sydney]], on April 14, 2008.<ref name=\"Premiere\" /> The film began releasing in international markets on April 30,<ref name=\"InternationalRelease\" /> and was released in the United States on May 2, 2008.<ref name=\"USRelease\" /> ''Iron Man'' was the first film released in [[Marvel Cinematic Universe: Phase One|Phase One]] of the MCU.<ref name=\"PhaseOne\" /> The film was formatted and screened in [[IMAX]] for the first time on August 30, 2018, as part of Marvel Studios' 10 year anniversary IMAX festival.<ref name=\"IMAX10thAnniversaryFestival\" />\n\n===Home media===\nThe film was released by [[Paramount Home Entertainment]] on DVD and [[Blu-ray Disc]] on September 30, 2008, in the United States and Canada, and October 27, 2008 in most of Europe.<ref name=\"HomeMediaRelease\" /> DVD sales were very successful, selling over 4 million copies the first week and generating a gross of over US$93&nbsp;million.<ref name=\"TheNumbers\" /><ref name=\"Rediff\" /> There were a total of 9&nbsp;million copies sold and an accumulated total sales of over $160&nbsp;million (not including Blu-ray).<ref name=\"TheNumbers\" /> For the home releases of the film, the image on the newspaper Stark reads before he announces he is Iron Man had to be altered because of amateur photographer Ronnie Adams filing a lawsuit against Paramount and Marvel for using his on-location spy photo in the scene.<ref name=\"AdamsPhoto\" /> A [[Walmart]]-exclusive release included a preview of ''[[Iron Man: Armored Adventures]]''.<ref name=\"WalMart\" />\n\nThe film was also collected in a 10-disc [[box set]] titled \"[[Marvel Cinematic Universe: Phase One#Home media|Marvel Cinematic Universe: Phase One \u2013 Avengers Assembled]]\" which includes all of the Phase One films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.<ref name=\"PhaseOneSetAnnounced\" /> It was released by [[Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment]] on April 2, 2013.<ref name=\"PhaseOneSetDelayed\" /> The IMAX Enhanced version of the film was made available on [[Disney+]] beginning on November 12, 2021.<ref name=\"IMAXEnhanced\" />\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Box office===\n''Iron Man'' earned $319&nbsp;million in the United States and Canada and $266.8&nbsp;million in other territories, for a worldwide gross of $585.8&nbsp;million.<ref name=\"Boxmojo\" />\n\nIn its opening weekend, ''Iron Man'' grossed $98.6&nbsp;million in 4,105 theaters in the United States and Canada, ranking first at the box office,<ref name=\"mojoweek\" /> giving it the eleventh biggest-opening weekend at the time,<ref name=\"mojoweekend\" /> ninth-widest release in terms of theaters,<ref name=\"mojotheaters\" /> and the third highest-grossing opening weekend of 2008 behind ''[[Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull]]'' and ''[[The Dark Knight (film)|The Dark Knight]]''.

The website's critical consensus reads, \"Powered by Robert Downey Jr.'s vibrant charm, ''Iron Man'' turbo-charges the superhero genre with a deft intelligence and infectious sense of fun.\"<ref name=\"RottenTomatoes\" /> On [[Metacritic]], the film has an average score of 79 out of 100, based on 38 critics, indicating <!-- CITED TERMINOLOGY, DO NOT CHANGE! -->\"generally favorable reviews\".<ref name=\"Metacritic\" /> Audiences polled by [[CinemaScore]] gave the film an average grade of \"A\" on an A+ to F scale.<ref name=\"CinemaScore\" />\n\nAmong the major trade journals, [[Todd McCarthy]] of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' called the film an \"expansively entertaining special effects extravaganza\" with \"fresh energy and stylistic polish\",<ref name=\"McCarthy\" /> while Kirk Honeycutt of ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' praised the film, while nonetheless finding \"disappointment [in] a climatic {{sic}} battle between different Iron Man prototypes ... how did Tony's nemesis learn how to use the suit?\"<ref name=\"Honeycutt\" /> In one of the first major-daily newspaper reviews, [[Frank Lovece]] of ''[[Newsday]]'' lauded the film's \"emotional truth ... pitch-perfect casting and plausibly rendered super-science\" that made it \"faithful to the source material while updating it \u2013 and recognizing what's made that material so enduring isn't just the high-tech cool of a man in a metal suit, but the human condition that got him there\".<ref name=\"Lovece\" /> [[Roger Ebert]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' gave the film four out of four stars, praising Downey Jr.'s performance and stating, \"At the end of the day it's Robert Downey Jr. who powers the lift-off separating this from most other superhero movies\".<ref name=\"Ebert\" /> [[A. O. Scott]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' called the film \"an unusually good superhero picture. Or at least \u2013 since it certainly has its problems \u2013 a superhero movie that's good in unusual ways.\"<ref name=\"Scott\" /> Among the specialty press, Garth Franklin of ''[[Dark Horizons]]'' commended the \"impressive sets and mechanics that combine smoothly with relatively seamless CG\", and said, \"Robert Downey Jr., along with director Jon Favreau ... help this rise above formula. The result is something that, whilst hardly original or groundbreaking, is nevertheless refreshing in its earnestness to avoid dark dramatic stylings in favor of an easy-going, crowd-pleasing action movie with a sprinkle of anti-war and redemption themes\".<ref name=\"Franklin\" />\n\nAmong major metropolitan weeklies, [[David Edelstein]] of ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' magazine called the film \"a shapely piece of mythmaking ... Favreau doesn't go in for stylized comic-book frames, at least in the first half. He gets real with it \u2013 you'd think you were watching a military thriller\",<ref name=\"Edelstein\" /> while conversely, [[David Denby (film critic)|David Denby]] of ''[[The New Yorker]]'' gave a negative review, claiming \"a slightly depressed, going-through-the-motions feel to the entire show ... [[Gwyneth Paltrow]], widening her eyes and palpitating, can't do much with an antique role as Stark's [[Girl Friday (idiom)|girl Friday]], who loves him but can't say so; Terrence Howard, playing a
