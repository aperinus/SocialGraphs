Written and directed by Alan Shapiro, the film stars [[Elijah Wood]] as Sandy Ricks, a boy who has to spend the summer with his Uncle Porter ([[Paul Hogan]]), who lives on the [[Gold Coast (Florida)|Florida Gold Coast]]. Although he expects to have a boring summer, he encounters a [[dolphin]] whom he names Flipper and with whom he forms a friendship.\n\nThe film is unrelated to the [[Flipper (1995 TV series)|1995\u20132000 TV series of the same name]] that was itself also a remake of the 1963 film and 1964 TV series. Instead of [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]], a production company for the ''Flipper'' franchise, this film is distributed by [[Universal Pictures]].\n\n== Plot ==\nSandy Ricks is sent off for the summer to stay with his Uncle Porter in the seaside town of Coral Key. Initially, Sandy is unenthusiastic and disappointed that he is not going to a [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]] concert. His mood remains unchanged even after meeting Cathy, a local shopkeeper with whom his uncle carries on a flirtatious relationship, and Kim, a girl his own age.\n\nWhile out on Porter's fishing trawler, they meet Porter's enemy, Dirk Moran. Nearby, a [[Dolphin#Socialization|pod]] of [[Bottlenose dolphins]] is frolicking near Dirks boat. As a big game fisherman, Dirk Moran makes it plain that he hates just about every other fish-eating animal on earth and shoots at the pod ending with a dolphin being fatally shot. Sandy meets a dolphin that escaped Dirk's shooting, and eventually names it Flipper.\n\nThe next morning, Porter and Sandy are paid a visit by the sheriff Buck Cowan, who explains that they could not keep the dolphin unless he is in captivity. That night, Sandy and Kim set out on a [[dinghy]] to look for Flipper. They fail to locate the dolphin, but see the dumping of barrels off of Dirk Moran's boat. The next morning, as Kim arrives looking for Sandy, Pete, Porter's pet brown pelican, comes running as if asking her to follow him. Pete leads Kim to Flipper who is beached on the shore and sick. They manage to cure Flipper anyhow.\n\nCathy determines that Flipper has been poisoned by toxic waste, which is also shown to have been ruining the local fishing. The group uses Flipper's ability of [[Animal echolocation|echolocation]] and a special camera attached to his head to help them locate the barrels of toxic waste. Flipper also manages to locate the rest of his pod, and reunites with them, in the process, dropping the camera. Porter rushes back to alert the sheriff about the barrels. Sandy, however becomes concerned that something has happened to Flipper, without informing anyone except Kathy's young son, Marvin, who sets off in the dinghy to find him.\n\nSandy barely survives an encounter with Dirk Moran's boat, which dismantles the dinghy. He sees an approaching [[dorsal fin]] and thinks it is Flipper, but it is actually Scar, a large [[great hammerhead shark]] that has been lurking in the island's waters and is said to have taken out a tourist boat. Sandy swims for his life towards Dirk's boat. As Scar is about to attack Sandy, Flipper appears and starts nose-butting him in the gills. There is a harrowing moment when Scar proves stronger than Flipper, but Flipper's dolphin pod comes to his aid in the nick of time and drive Scar away. Dirk Moran is then arrested by the sheriff for illegally dumping toxic waste and attempting to kill Sandy since he knew that he saw them that night.\n\nThe next morning, when Sandy's mother and younger sister arrive to pick him up, there is a commotion. It is Flipper, who has come to see Sandy off.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Paul Hogan]] as Porter Ricks\n* [[Elijah Wood]] as Sandy Ricks\n* [[Jessica Wesson]] as Kim Parker\n* [[Jonathan Banks]] as Dirk Moran\n* Bill Kelley as Donald\n* [[Chelsea Field]] as Cathy\n* [[Isaac Hayes]] as Sheriff Buck Cowan\n* [[Jason Fuchs]] as Marvin\n* Robert Deacon as Bounty Fisherman #1\n* Ann Carey as Fisherman's Friend \n* Mark Casella as Bounty Fisherman #2\n* [[Luke Halpin]] as Bounty Fisherman #3\n\n== Production ==\nThe film was shot in the Bahamas.<ref name=\"Leydon\">{{cite news |url=https://www.variety.com/review/VE1117905217 |title=Flipper Review |access-date=2009-11-16 |last=Leydon |first=Joe |date=1996-05-06 |publisher=Variety }}</ref> Animatronic dolphins, designed by [[Walt Conti]] and his team, had to be used extensively, such as in scenes where Flipper interacts with the human characters, or is shown swimming along.
