It is based on the nonfiction book ''The Bridge at Remagen: The Amazing Story of March 7, 1945'' by writer and [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] [[Ken Hechler]].<ref>{{cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/Bridge-Remagen-Amazing-Story-Crossed/dp/B00DEV0U0M/ref=tmm_hrd_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=&sr=|title=The Bridge at Remagen: The Amazing Story of March 7, 1945: The Day the Rhine River Was Crossed|authorlink=Ken Hechler|first=Ken|last=Hechler|publisher=[[Easton Press]]|location=[[Norwalk, Connecticut]]|year=1998|asin=B00DEV0U0M|edition=2nd}}</ref> The screenplay was adapted by [[Richard Yates (novelist)|Richard Yates]] and [[William Roberts (screenwriter)|William Roberts]].<ref name=\"The Bridge at Remagen\" />\n\nThe film is a highly fictionalized version of actual events during the last months of [[World War II]] when the [[9th Armored Division (United States)|U.S. 9th Armored Division]] approached [[Remagen]] and [[Battle of Remagen|captured]] the intact [[Ludendorff Bridge]]. While the real battle ran for a week and involved several artillery duels between the U.S. troops and German defenders, the film focuses more specifically on the heroism and human cost in gaining the bridgehead across the Rhine before the [[Western Allied invasion of Germany|Allies' final advance into Germany]]. The Remagen bridge was never rebuilt; the towers on each bank were converted into a museum and arts studios.\n\n==Plot==\nThe film opens with the [[United States Army]] failing to capture the still-intact [[Oberkassel, Bonn|Oberkassel]] railway bridge. Lieutenant Hartman (George Segal) is an experienced combat team leader who is becoming weary of the war in Europe. After he is promoted to company commander following the reckless death of the previous officer, Hartman is ordered to advance to the [[Rhine River]] at [[Remagen]], where he is promised a rest for his men. At the same time, Major Paul Kreuger (Robert Vaughn) of the [[German Army (1935\u20131945)|German Army]] is assigned to destroy the Remagen bridge by his friend and superior, Colonel General von Brock ([[Peter van Eyck]]), who has been given a written order to do it immediately. The general appeals to Kreuger's sense of honor, giving him a verbal command to defend the bridge for as long as possible, to allow the German [[15th Army (Wehrmacht)|15th Army]], trapped on the west bank of the river, to escape.\n\nAfter capturing the undefended town of [[Meckenheim]], 12 miles (20&nbsp;km) from Remagen, Hartman is ordered by his battalion commander, Major Barnes ([[Bradford Dillman]]), to continue the advance until encountering resistance. Kreuger tours the defenses above the town of Remagen and assures the local contingent of defending German troops, many of whom are older men and boys, that the [[tank]] reserves personally guaranteed by the general are on the way. When Hartman's troops attack the town, Kreuger discovers that von Brock made an empty promise to him; he calls the general's headquarters for the promised tanks and is told they have been sent \"elsewhere\". On finding the bridge intact, General Shinner ([[E. G. Marshall]]) orders Major Barnes to secure its capture, saying: \"It's a crap shoot, Major. We're risking 100 men, but you may save 10,000.\" Barnes agrees to commit Hartman's company and orders them to assault the German defenses on the bridge to gain a foothold across the Rhine. By doing so, the U.S. Army would avoid a more costly river crossing elsewhere. Sergeant Angelo (Ben Gazzara), one of Hartman's squad leaders, strikes Barnes after the major threatens Hartman.\n\nAs the U.S. soldiers rush the bridge, Kreuger, along with [[Explosives engineering|explosives]] [[Combat engineer|engineer]] Captain Baumann ([[Joachim Hansen (actor)|Joachim Hansen]]) and Captain Schmidt ([[Hans Christian Blech]]) from the Remagen Bridge Security Command, try to blow up the bridge, but the explosives they use prove to be not the high-yield military grade charges needed for the job, but weaker, industrial explosives, which fail to destroy the structure. Hartman's troops dig in to consolidate their position on the bridge.\n\nKreuger shoots two soldiers as they try to desert. Realizing the futility of the situation, Kreuger returns to headquarters to make a personal appeal to the general for more reinforcements, but on arrival finds the HQ building seized by the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]]. Von Brock has been arrested by the S.S. for \"defeatism.\" Kreuger is questioned by them about the delay in destroying the bridge and is also arrested.\n\nAt Remagen, Hartman leads a raid against a [[machine-gun nest]] installed by Kreuger on board a barge moored to the bridge, but while killing its crew, Angelo is hit and falls into the river. Hartman marches on foot towards the bridge defenders' post at the same time as a squadron of [[M24 Chaffee]] light tanks crosses the bridge. The remaining German soldiers surrender to the U.S. troops. In the aftermath of the battle, Hartman discovers Angelo alive. The next day, Kreuger is led out for execution by an SS firing squad. With the sound of airplanes overhead, Kreuger asks: \"Ours or theirs?\". The attending SS officer replies, \"Enemy planes, sir!\" \"But who is the enemy?\" muses Kreuger before he is shot.\n\nA screen message (or chyron) informs the viewer that the actual bridge collapsed into the Rhine 10 days after its capture.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[George Segal]] as Lieutenant Phil Hartman, based on Lieutenant [[Karl H.
