The film stars [[Cuba Gooding Jr.]], with a supporting cast of [[James Coburn]] (in one of his final roles), [[Joanna Bacalso]], [[Sisq\u00f3]], [[Nichelle Nichols]], [[Christopher Judge]], [[Michael Bolton]] and [[M. Emmet Walsh]]. The film was released in the United States on January 18, 2002, by [[Walt Disney Pictures]]. The film is inspired by the book, ''[[Winterdance]]'', by [[Gary Paulsen]].\n\n==Plot==\n<!--per [[WP:FILMPLOT]], plot summaries should be between 400 and 700 words--> \nDr. Theodore \"Ted\" Brooks (Gooding) is a celebrity [[Dentistry|dentist]] in [[Miami]], [[Florida]]. Every city bus carries an advertisement for his dental practice \"Hot Smile\" with his picture. One day, Ted receives a letter from [[Alaska]], naming him as the only heir of Lucy Watkins, a resident of the backwoods village of Tolketna. Ted's mother Amelia ([[Nichelle Nichols]]) reveals that he is adopted; Lucy was his biological mother.\n\nTed travels to Tolketna to claim his inheritance from Lucy: seven [[Siberian Husky|Siberian Huskies]] named Diesel, Mack, Sniff, Yodel, Scooper, Duchess and Demon, and a [[Border Collie]] named Nana. Completely out of his element, Ted is confounded by [[blizzard]]s, thin ice, [[fox]]es, [[skunk]]s, [[grizzly bear]]s, an intimidating, crusty old [[mountain man]] named James \"Thunder Jack\" Johnson (Coburn), and the aggressive, defiant lead dog, Demon. All of this happens with the buzzing excitement of the Arctic Challenge Sled Dog Race, which is only two weeks away.\n\nTed tries to find out why he was given up for adoption, and who was his biological father. He meets bar owner Barb ([[Joanna Bacalso]]), a close friend of Lucy. Barb helps Ted to deal with the dogs and teaches him how to drive a sled, and the two fall in love. Ted has several encounters with Thunder Jack, who tries to buy the dogs, especially Demon. Barb reveals to Ted that Thunder Jack is his biological father. Ted confronts Jack, who initially denies the claims.\n\nWhen Ted loses consciousness while practicing sledding and being chased by a bear, Jack rescues him and takes him to a cave. Jack offers to reveal the truth in exchange for the dogs; Ted agrees. Jack claims that he and Lucy hid from a storm in the same cave during an Arctic Challenge, and it was then that Ted was conceived. When Jack woke up, Lucy was gone. He looked for her but never found her.\n\nTed lets Jack have the dogs and returns to Miami. Jack adds Demon as lead dog of his team for the Arctic Challenge. When the race begins, Jack decides to press on in the middle of a fierce storm.\n\nIn Miami, Ted recounts his experiences to his mother, who accidentally breaks a frame holding a picture of Lucy and Demon. Inside of the frame is a snapshot of Lucy and Jack with a baby. Ted is infuriated that Jack lied to him, and rushes back to Alaska. He learns that Jack has gone missing and the weather is too bad for searching. Ted decides to search for Jack himself, taking Lucy's dogs with Nana as lead. A few hours later, Amelia arrives and meets Barb. She learns that Ted is out on the trail, searching for Jack. The \"Arctic Flame\" is burning over the finish line, until the last musher arrives.\n\nTed eventually locates Jack in the old cave. Jack admits he and Lucy had been together at the hospital when Ted was born, and that he loved her very much; but that he and Lucy had agreed then that neither one of them were ready to be parents. Ted also discovers that Demon's bad temper is due to a rotten tooth. He pulls the tooth, and Demon becomes a much friendlier dog. During the journey back to Tolketna, the sled nearly goes over a cliff into a river, but the dogs pull themselves back up. Ted finally brings Thunder Jack across the finish line. Ted introduces Jack to Amelia, and he and Jack decide to share the \"Arctic Flame\" trophy, which is given to whoever comes in last.\n\nSome time later, Ted has moved his dental practice to Tolketna. He and Barb have married, and Barb is now his receptionist and pregnant, while Nana and Demon have four puppies. Back in Miami, Ted's cousin Rupert ([[Sisq\u00f3]]), also a dentist, becomes the new celebrity dentist, now with his face on every city bus.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Cuba Gooding Jr.]] as Dr. Theodore \"Ted\" Brooks (a.k.a. \"Teddy Bear\"), a [[Miami]] dentist who goes to Alaska to find his origins and encounters a pack of sled dogs\n** [[Jascha Washington]] as Young Ted\n* [[Joanna Bacalso]] as Barb, a local Tolketna bar owner, and Ted's love interest\n* [[James Coburn]] as James \"Thunder Jack\" Johnson, a mountain man and Ted's biological father\n* [[Sisq\u00f3]] as Dr. Rupert Brooks, Ted's adopted cousin\n* [[Nichelle Nichols]] as Amelia Brooks, Ted's adoptive mother\n* [[Christopher Judge]] as Dr. Brooks, Ted's adoptive father\n* [[Michael Bolton]] as Himself, who appears in Ted's dream giving him advice that he still has soul\n* [[M.
