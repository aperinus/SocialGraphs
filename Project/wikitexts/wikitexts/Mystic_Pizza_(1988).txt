Kat, the younger sister, is an aspiring astronomer working at the planetarium in the Whaling Museum of the [[Mystic Seaport]], and [[Yale University]] accepted her on a partial scholarship. Kat works at the restaurant and as a babysitter to raise money for school. Daisy's goal is to have as much fun as possible. Their mother is pleased with Kat, while often questioning Daisy's life choices.\n\nDaisy meets Charles, a rich young man at a bar. The two are immediately attracted to each other and begin a relationship, much to her mother's dismay. At a family dinner, Charles's relatives unintentionally make insensitive comments about Daisy's ethnicity, and Charles overreacts. Daisy breaks up with him, accusing him of using her to rebel against his parents.\n\nKat finds herself infatuated with her employer Tim, an architect and Yale graduate, who hired her to babysit his four-year-old daughter Phoebe while his wife works in England. A relationship ultimately develops between them that she believes to be love, and they have sex. However, when his wife returns, Kat's illusions are shattered. Daisy consoles her devastated sister, and they bond.\n\nJojo fainted at her wedding to Bill because she had cold feet about making a lifetime commitment. Nonetheless, she wants to continue having sex with Bill until she is ready to be married. Bill eventually breaks up with her because she will not make a commitment.\n\nA famous television food critic called \"The Fireside Gourmet\" unexpectedly visits Mystic Pizza. As Kat, Daisy, Jojo, and Leona watch from the counter, he takes a few bites of one pizza slice, jots notes in his notebook, and leaves after paying the check. His approval can do wonders for a restaurant, but they are not optimistic. However, a few days later he gives the pizzeria his highest rating, calling the pizza \"superb\". The restaurant phone immediately starts ringing, with Leona laughing as she informs the caller that no reservations are needed.\n\nIn the end, Tim brings Phoebe to Mystic Pizza because she wants to say goodbye to Kat. Tim gives her a check to help cover her tuition expenses, but she tears it up; she later accepts money from Leona. Jojo finally marries Bill, and Daisy and Charles reconcile at the wedding. The film ends with the three girls overlooking the water from the restaurant's balcony, reminiscing about their time together and wondering about the future.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Annabeth Gish]] as Katherine \"Kat\" Ara\u00fajo\n* [[Julia Roberts]] as Daisy Ara\u00fajo\n* [[Lili Taylor]] as Josefina \"Jojo\" Barbosa\n* [[Vincent D'Onofrio]] as William \"Bill\" Montijo \n* [[William R.
