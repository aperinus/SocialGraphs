Set in [[Hollywood, Los Angeles|Hollywood]], California just before [[World War II]], the film depicts the alienation and desperation of a disparate group of individuals whose dreams of success fail to come true. The screenplay by [[Waldo Salt]] is based on the [[The Day of the Locust|1939 novel of the same title]] by [[Nathanael West]].\n\nThe film has garnered attention from scholars for its critical commentary on the film industry, as well as its nightmarish depiction of Hollywood, with some critics identifying implicit [[horror film|horror]] elements in the film's visuals.\n\n==Plot==\nAspiring artist and recent [[Yale University|Yale]] graduate Tod Hackett arrives in 1930s [[Hollywood, Los Angeles|Hollywood]] to work as a painter at a major film studio. He rents an apartment in the San Bernardino Arms, a rundown apartment building occupied by various people, many on the fringes of the industry: Among them are Faye Greener, a tawdry aspiring actress; her father Harry, an ex-[[vaudeville|vaudevillian]]; Abe Kusich, a [[dwarfism|dwarf]] who carries on a tempestuous relationship with his girlfriend, Mary; Adore Loomis, a young boy whose mother is hoping to turn him into a [[child actor|child star]]; and Homer Simpson, a [[repression (psychology)|repressed]] accountant who lusts after Faye. Tod's unit has a crack in a wall caused by an earthquake; he puts a bright red flower in the crack. Tod befriends Faye, and attends a screening of a film in which she has a [[bit part]], accompanied by Earle Shoop, a cowboy she is dating. Faye is disappointed with the film after finding that her appearance has been severely truncated. Tod attempts to romance Faye, but she coyly declines him, telling him she would only marry a rich man.\n\nTod attends a party at the [[Hollywood Hills]] mansion, where the partygoers indulge in watching [[stag film]]s. Despite her hesitations, Faye continues to spend time with Tod. The two have a campfire in the desert with Earle and his friend, Miguel. A drunken Tod becomes enraged when Faye dances with Miguel, and chases after her, apparently to rape her, but she fends him off. Some time later, Faye and Homer take Harry to a [[holy roller]] church gathering led by a female preacher known as Big Sister, who performs a public \"healing\" of him in an attempt to cure his heart ailment, but he subsequently dies. In order to pay for Harry's funeral costs, Faye begins prostituting herself.\n\nThe shy, obsessive Homer continues to vie for Faye's affections, caring for her after her father's death. The two eventually move in together, and Faye continues to hopelessly find employment as a movie extra. While filming a [[Battle of Waterloo|Waterloo]]-themed period drama, Faye escapes injury during a violent collapse of the set, and reunites with Tod, who witnesses the accident. Faye and Homer subsequently invite Tod to dinner. The three attend a dinner theater featuring a [[drag queen|drag]] show as entertainment. During the dinner, Faye confesses to Tod that her relationship with Homer is sexless, but is loving and offers her security. Later, Faye and Homer host a party attended by Tod, Abe, Earle, Miguel, and Claude Estee, a successful art director. Faye marauds about throughout the party, attempting to impress Claude and the other men. While outside, Homer observes the various men drunkenly fawning over Faye through a window. When Faye notices him, she accuses him of being a [[Voyeurism|peeping tom]] before throwing a vase through the window. Shortly after, Homer walks in on Faye having sex with Miguel. Tod passively ignores the scene, but Earle discovers it and begins fighting with Miguel.\n\nLater, the premiere of ''[[The Buccaneer (1938 film)|The Buccaneer]]'' is taking place at [[TCL Chinese Theatre|Grauman's Chinese Theatre]], attended by celebrities and a large crowd of fans and actors, including Faye. Tod, stuck in traffic due to the event, notices Homer walking aimlessly through the street. He attempts to talk to Homer, but Homer ignores him, seating himself on a bench near the theater. Adore, attending the premiere with his mother, begins pestering Homer before hitting him in the head with a rock. Enraged, Homer chases Adore through the crowd and into a parking lot. When Adore trips and falls, Homer begins violently stomping on him, crushing his bones and organs, killing him. Adore's dying screams draw the attention of the crowd, who come upon Homer standing on the child's bloodied corpse. A mob subsequently pursues Homer, beating him viciously, and a full-blown [[riot]] soon breaks out. Meanwhile, an announcer at the premiere mistakes the action across the street for excitement over the film. Faye is assaulted in the melee, Tod suffers a [[compound fracture]] to his leg, and a car is flipped over, igniting a fire. As Tod observes the frenzy, he witnesses the [[Apparitional experience|apparition]]s of numerous faceless, [[Goya]]esque figures from his paintings descending on the scene.\n\nOn a morning shortly thereafter, Faye wanders into Tod's abandoned apartment. She sees everything was removed except for the flower in the wall crack, and her eyes well with tears.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[William Atherton]] as Tod Hackett\n* [[Karen Black]] as Faye Greener\n* [[Donald Sutherland]] as Homer Simpson\n* [[Burgess Meredith]] as Harry Greener\n* [[Geraldine Page]] as Big Sister\n* [[Richard Dysart]] as Claude Estee\n* [[Bo Hopkins]] as Earle Shoop\n* [[Pepe Serna]] as Miguel\n* [[Lelia Goldoni]] as Mary Dove\n* [[Billy Barty]] as Abe Kusich\n* [[Jackie Earle Haley]] as Adore Loomis\n* [[Gloria LeRoy]] as Mrs. Loomis\n* Jane Hoffman as Mrs. Odlesh\n* [[Norman Leavitt]] as Mr. Odlesh\n* [[Madge Kennedy]] as Mrs. Johnson\n* [[Natalie Schafer]] as Audrey Jennings\n* [[Gloria Stroock]] as Alice Estee\n* [[Nita Talbot]] as Joan\n* [[Paul Stewart (actor)|Paul Stewart]] as Helverston\n* [[John Hillerman]] as Ned Grote\n* [[William Castle]] as the Director\n* [[Paul Jabara]] as the Nightclub Entertainer \n}}\n\n==Analysis==\nFilm scholar M.

The movie is far from subtle, but it doesn't matter. It seems that much more material was shot than could be easily fitted into the movie, even at 144 minutes... It is reality projected as fantasy. Its grossness \u2014 its bigger-than-life quality \u2014 is so much a part of its style (and what West was writing about) that one respects the extravagances, the almost lunatic scale on which Mr. Schlesinger has filmed its key sequences.\"<ref>{{cite web|title='Day of Locust' Turns Dross Into Gold|date=May 8, 1975|last=Canby|first=Vincent|author-link=Vincent Canby|url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9A07E2D71E3EE53BBC4053DFB366838E669EDE|work=[[The New York Times]]|archive-url=https://archive.today/20190821024715/https://www.nytimes.com/1975/05/08/archives/day-of-locust-turns-dross-into-gold.html|archive-date=August 21, 2019}}</ref>\n\n[[Jay Cocks]] of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' said; \"''The Day of the Locust'' looks puffy and overdrawn, sounds shrill because it is made with a combination of self-loathing and tenuous moral superiority.
