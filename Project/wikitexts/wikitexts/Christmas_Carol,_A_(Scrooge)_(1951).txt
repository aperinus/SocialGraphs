It stars [[Alastair Sim]] as [[Ebenezer Scrooge]], and was produced and directed by [[Brian Desmond Hurst]], with a [[screenplay]] by [[Noel Langley]].\n\n[[File:Brian Desmond Hurst. Allan Warren.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Brian Desmond Hurst, producer and director of ''Scrooge'' (''A Christmas Carol''), in 1976 (portrait by [[Allan Warren]])]]\n\nThe film also features [[Kathleen Harrison]] as Mrs. Dilber, Scrooge's [[charwoman]]. [[George Cole (actor)|George Cole]] stars as the younger [[Ebenezer Scrooge|Scrooge]], [[Hermione Baddeley]] as Mrs. Cratchit, [[Mervyn Johns]] as Bob Cratchit, Clifford Mollison as Samuel Wilkins, a debtor; [[Jack Warner (actor)|Jack Warner]] as Mr. Jorkin, a role created for the film; [[Ernest Thesiger]] as Jacob Marley's [[undertaker]]; and [[Patrick Macnee]] as the younger Jacob Marley. [[Michael Hordern]] plays Jacob Marley's ghost, as well as the older Jacob Marley. [[Peter Bull]] serves as narrator, by reading portions of Charles Dickens' words at the beginning and end of the film; he also appears on-screen as one of the businessmen talking with Scrooge (at the beginning of the film) and discussing Scrooge's funeral (as witnessed by Scrooge with the Ghost of Christmas Future).\n\n== Plot ==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 to 700 words. Current word count is 577. -->\n\nOn Christmas Eve 1843, Ebenezer Scrooge tells two businessmen that he has no intention of celebrating Christmas. At his workplace, he refuses to donate to two men collecting for the poor. His nephew, Fred, invites him to dinner the next day, but Scrooge refuses, disparaging Fred for having married against his will. Scrooge reluctantly gives his poor clerk Bob Cratchit a paid holiday, but expects him back to work earlier the next day.\n\nScrooge returns home and sees the door-knocker transform into the face of his long-dead partner, Jacob Marley. Inside the house, Jacob Marley appears as a ghost before Scrooge, warning that he must repent or suffer being forever bound in chains after death. He further warns Scrooge that he will be visited by three spirits; the first will arrive at one o'clock. Frightened by the visitation, Scrooge takes refuge in his bed.\n\nAt one o'clock, the [[Ghost of Christmas Past]] arrives. Scrooge is shown himself alone at school, unwanted by his father ever since his mother [[Maternal death|died in childbirth]]. His beloved sister Fan arrives to take him home, telling her brother that their father has recently had a change of heart toward Ebenezer. Next, the Spirit shows Scrooge the annual Christmas party thrown by his benevolent employer Fezziwig. He witnesses his proposal to his sweetheart Alice, who accepts his ring. He is then shown how he is tempted to leave Fezziwig's to join a business run by Mr. Jorkin, where he meets Jacob Marley.\n\nAfter Jorkin's firm buys up Fezziwig's failed business, Alice breaks her engagement to Scrooge because of his dedication to \"a golden idol.\" Scrooge witnesses the death of Fan, who had just given birth to his nephew Fred, and discovers he missed her last words asking him to look after her son. Years later, when Jorkin is found to have embezzled funds from his now-bankrupt company, Scrooge and Marley make good on the missing funds, essentially taking over. On Christmas Eve 1836, Scrooge refuses to leave work early to visit Marley, who is on his deathbed. When Scrooge finally arrives, Marley, realizing he will be punished for his misdeeds, tries to warn Scrooge against his avarice before he dies. The Spirit reproaches Scrooge for taking Marley's money and house, as an ashamed Scrooge finds himself back in his bed.\n\nScrooge is visited by the [[Ghost of Christmas Present]] who takes him to see how \"men of goodwill\" celebrate Christmas. He shows him poor miners joyfully singing Christmas carols and the Cratchits' warm Christmas celebration. Scrooge asks whether their disabled child, Tiny Tim, will survive his physical condition, but the Spirit hints that he may not. They next visit Fred's Christmas party, where Fred defends his uncle from his guests' snide remarks. Alice is working in a poorhouse, where she lovingly ministers to the sick and homeless on Christmas Eve. When Scrooge is unable to tell the Spirit that he may profit by what he has seen, the Spirit shows him two emaciated children \u2013 personifying Ignorance and Want \u2013 and pointedly mocks and scourges Scrooge with the miser's very own words when Scrooge shows concern for their welfare: \"Are there no prisons? Are there no workhouses?\"\n\nScrooge encounters the [[Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come]], who shows him the Cratchits mourning Tiny Tim's death. He then watches as three people, including his [[charwoman]] Mrs. Dilber, sell off the possessions of a dead man and two businessmen discussing the man's funeral proposals. When shown the man\u2019s grave bearing his own name, Scrooge begs the Spirit for a second chance, pleading \"I'm not the man I was.\" He awakens in his own bed to learn from Mrs. Dilber that it's Christmas Day and realizes he still has an opportunity to make amends. Though Mrs. Dilber is initially frightened by his transformation, Scrooge reassures her and promises to raise her salary. He anonymously purchases a turkey dinner for the Cratchits and delights Fred by attending his dinner party and dancing with the other guests.\n\nThe next day, Scrooge plays a [[practical joke]] on Bob Cratchit, pretending to dismiss him for being late but instead giving him a raise. Scrooge becomes \"as good a man as the old city ever knew\" and a second father to Tiny Tim, who does not die and gets well again.\n\n==Featured cast==\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Alastair Sim]] as [[Ebenezer Scrooge]]\n* [[Kathleen Harrison]] as Mrs. Dilber, Charwoman\n* [[Mervyn Johns]] as [[Bob Cratchit]]\n* [[Hermione Baddeley]] as Mrs. Cratchit\n* [[Michael Hordern]] as [[Jacob Marley]]'s Ghost\n* [[George Cole (actor)|George Cole]] as Young Ebenezer Scrooge\n* [[Glyn Dearman]] as [[Tiny Tim (A Christmas Carol)|Tiny Tim]]\n* John Charlesworth as Peter Cratchit\n* [[Michael J.

One of the more notable tunes is a polka, used in the two different versions of Fred's dinner party: the one Scrooge observes while with the Ghost of Christmas Present, and the other with Scrooge attending the party after atoning for his past coldness to Fred and his wife. The tune is similar to a traditional Slovenian polka called \"Stoparjeva\" (\"hitchhiker\") or just \"Stopar\".\n\nThe film also contains excerpts from some traditional Christmas carols and other tunes. \"[[Hark! The Herald Angels Sing]]\" is sung over part of the opening credits, and by the miners when Scrooge is with the Ghost of Christmas Present. An instrumental version of \"[[I Saw Three Ships]]\" is played when Scrooge gives a coin to Mrs. Dilber, and again just before the end of the film. \"[[Silent Night]]\" is played and sung at various times, including over the last part of the final scene and \"The End\".\n\nThe English country dance \"[[Sir Roger de Coverley]]\" is played and danced during the scene where Scrooge visits the office of Old Fezziwig with The Ghost of Christmas Past.\n\nThe tragic folk song \"[[Barbara Allen (song)|Barbara Allen]]\" is played as an instrumental when young Scrooge is talking with his sister Fan, and sung by a duet at Fred's Christmas party. Scrooge turns up in the middle of the line \"Young man, I think you're dying,\" thereby causing the singers to stop before the last two words.\n\n==Comparison with the source material==\nIn the film, Mrs Dilber is the name of the charwoman, whereas in the book the woman was unnamed and the laundress was named Mrs Dilber. The charwoman's role is greatly expanded in the film, to the point that she receives second billing in the list of characters.\n\nThe film also expands on the story by detailing Scrooge's rise as a prominent businessman. He was corrupted by a greedy new mentor, Mr. Jorkin (played by [[Jack Warner (actor)|Jack Warner]], a familiar British actor at the time) who lured him away from the benevolent Mr. Fezziwig and also introduced him to Jacob Marley. When Jorkin, who does not appear at all in Dickens's original story, is discovered to be an [[Embezzlement|embezzler]], the opportunistic Scrooge and Jacob Marley offer to compensate the company's losses on the condition that they receive control of the company for which they work \u2013 and so, ''Scrooge and Marley'' is born.\n\nDuring the [[Ghost of Christmas Present]] sequence, Scrooge's former fianc\u00e9e, Alice, works with the homeless and sick.  The character is named \"Belle\" in the book, and becomes a happily-married mother of several children.\n\nThe film also posits that Ebenezer's sister died while giving birth to his nephew, Fred, thus engendering Scrooge's estrangement from him. We are also told that Ebenezer's mother died while giving birth to him. This causes his father to resent him just as Ebenezer resents his nephew, and also means that Ebenezer has to be younger than Fan. In the book, Fan is much younger than Ebenezer, and the cause of her death is not mentioned.\n\n== Release ==\nThe film was released in Great Britain under its original title, ''Scrooge''. [[United Artists]] handled the U.S. release under the title ''A Christmas Carol''. The film was originally slated to be shown at New York City's [[Radio City Music Hall]] as part of their Christmas attraction, but the theatre management decided that the film was too grim and did not possess enough family entertainment value to warrant an engagement at the Music Hall. Instead, the film premiered at the Guild Theatre (near the Music Hall, and not to be confused with the [[August Wilson Theatre|Guild Theatre]] which showcased plays) on 28 November 1951.<ref name=\"NYTimes\">{{cite news |last=Crowther |first=Bosley |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1951/11/29/archives/the-screen-in-review-dickens-a-christmas-carol-with-alastair-sim.html |title=The Screen In Review; Dickens' 'A Christmas Carol,' With Alastair Sim Playing Scrooge, Unveiled Here |work=The New York Times |date=29 November 1951 |page=41}}</ref>\n\n=== Home media ===\nThe film was released on Blu-ray in 2009 by VCI, in a package that also included a DVD copy of the film, cropped into a faux widescreen format.
