He has a nihilistic view of the world which is why he never does homework and skips school frequently. His academic delinquency puts him on academic probation.\n\nOne day while on the school roof he encounters another classmate, Sally ([[Emma Roberts]]), smoking. When a teacher appears, George pulls out a cigarette and takes the fall for Sally. They become friends.\n\nOn career day, George meets young artist, Dustin ([[Michael Angarano]]), finding him inspiring. He brings Sally with him to visit Dustin at his studio in Brooklyn and it becomes apparent that Dustin finds Sally attractive. She invites George to a New Year's Eve party where she dances with an ex-boyfriend and George gets drunk, goes outside, throws up, and falls asleep in an alley. Finding him there, she takes him to her place, putting him to bed on a pull-out next to her bed. They grow close and George gets more involved in school.\n\nOn Valentine's Day, they go out to dinner and Sally starts asking questions about what he thinks of her. George is evasive, and she asks him if he'll have sex with her. George freezes. Sally backtracks and claims she was kidding. He remains withdrawn and leaves early. He refuses to take Sally's calls and avoids her. One day Sally runs into Dustin in the street and after a while the two of them start a relationship. George, troubled by this, stops doing homework and is again sent to the principal's ([[Blair Underwood]]) office.\n\nThe principal gives George two choices: be expelled, or make up all of the work he has missed all year. Confronted by his mother and stepfather ([[Rita Wilson]] and [[Sam Robards]]) at home, he responds by telling his mother that his stepfather has been lying about work. The stepfather attacks him and George knocks him down before taking off. He goes to Sally's and, in the hallway, kisses her. Sally kisses back but breaks away as Dustin is in her apartment. Angry and hurt, George leaves.\n\nThe next morning, George finds his mother in the park and she tells him she's divorcing his stepfather. Consoling her, he begins to rethink his life. He decides to make the effort to do his assignments. His art teacher tells him he wants only one project, but that it must be honest and real. George works on his backwork and takes his final exams. Meanwhile, Sally continues seeing Dustin.\n\nOne day George gets a message from Sally. They meet and she tells him she's going backpacking with Dustin through Europe and skipping graduation. He tells her he's in love with her and they go back to her apartment, where they kiss. She tells him she loves him too and promises they'll be together one day. George turns in all his assignments and the principal tells him he'll know he's passed if his name is called at graduation. George's art teacher applauds him on his project.\n\nAt graduation, George is with Sally's friends with his mother in the audience. Sally is at the airport with Dustin. George's name is called and his mother applauds. Afterwards George is in the art classroom looking at his art project, the portrait of Sally. She walks in, joining him looking at the painting as the film closes.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Freddie Highmore]] as George Zinavoy\n* [[Emma Roberts]] as Sally Howe\n* [[Michael Angarano]] as Dustin Mason\n* [[Alicia Silverstone]] as Ms. Herman\n* [[Rita Wilson]] as Vivian Sargent, George's mother\n* [[Blair Underwood]] as Principal Bill Martinson\n* [[Elizabeth Reaser]] as Charlotte Howe\n* [[Sam Robards]] as John Sargent, George's stepfather\n* [[Marcus Carl Franklin]] as Will Sharpe\n* [[Sasha Spielberg]] as Zoe Rubenstein\n* [[Jarlath Conroy]] as Harris McElroy\n* [[Ann Dowd]] as Mrs. Grimes\n\n==Production==\n{{Expand section|date=September 2014}}\nThe film finished shooting in [[New York City]] on April 23, 2010.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.empireonline.com/news/story.asp?NID=27640 |magazine=[[Empire (film magazine)|Empire]] |last=White |first=James |title=Freddie Highmore Has Homework |date=April 22, 2010 |access-date=December 19, 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Soundtrack==\nThe music from the film was released by [[Rhino Entertainment|Rhino Records]] on June 14 as a CD soundtrack with 12 tracks.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://filmmusicreporter.com/2011/06/06/the-art-of-getting-by-soundtrack-details/| title = The Art of Getting By' Soundtrack Details | publisher = Filmmusicreporter.com| access-date = 3 March 2012}}</ref><ref>{{discogs release|5889028}}.</ref>\n;Track Listing\n# \"We Will Become Silhouettes\" - [[The Shins]]\n# \"We Drink on the Job\" - [[Earlimart (band)|Earlimart]]\n# \"Sally's Theme\" - [[Alec Puro]]\n# \"Sleep The Clock Around\" - [[Mates of State]]\n# \"[[This Momentary]]\" - [[Delphic (band)|Delphic]]\n# \"Christmas Break\" - Alec Puro\n# \"Winter Lady\" - [[Leonard Cohen]]\n# \"The Skin of My Yellow Country Teeth\" - [[Clap Your Hands Say Yeah]]\n# \"Sally's Bedroom\" - Alec Puro\n# \"Spitting Fire\" - [[The Boxer Rebellion (band)|The Boxer Rebellion]]\n# \"Here\" - [[Pavement (band)|Pavement]]\n# \"The Trial of the Century\" - [[French Kicks]]\n\n==Release==\nThe film had its world premiere at the 2011 Sundance Film Festival on January 23, 2011.<ref name=premiere /> The movie was released on [[Blu-ray Disc]] on November 29, 2011.\n\n==Reception==\n===Box office===\n''The Art of Getting By'' grossed $1.4 million in the United States and Canada, and $0.6 million in other territories, for a total of $2 million, against a production budget of $4 million.<ref name=\"TN\" />\n\n===Critical response===\n{{RT data|as of|y|m}}, the film holds {{a or an|{{RT data|score}}}} approval rating on film [[review aggregator]] [[Rotten Tomatoes]], based on {{RT data|count}} reviews with an average rating of {{RT data|average}}.
