The film was Fleischer Studios' first feature-length animated film, as well as the second animated feature film produced by an American studio after [[Walt Disney Productions]]' ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]'', as Paramount had commissioned the feature in response to the success of that film.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Lenburg |first1=Jeff |title=The Encyclopedia of Animated Cartoons |date=1999 |publisher=Checkmark Books |isbn=0-8160-3831-7 |access-date=June 6, 2020 |url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780816038312/page/181/mode/2up |page=181}}</ref> The sequences for the film were directed by [[Seymour Kneitel]], [[Willard Bowsky]], [[Tom Palmer (animator)|Tom Palmer]], [[Grim Natwick]], William Henning, [[Roland Crandall]], Thomas Johnson, Robert Leffingwell, Frank Kelling, Winfield Hoskins, and Orestes Calpini.\n\n==Plot==\nOn November 5, 1699, Lemuel Gulliver washes onto the beach of [[Lilliput and Blefuscu|Lilliput]] after his ship is wrecked in a storm. [[Town crier]] Gabby stumbles across an unconscious Gulliver during his rounds  (\"All's Well\") and rushes back to Lilliput to warn everyone about the \"giant on the beach\". Meanwhile, King Little of Lilliput and King Bombo of Blefuscu are signing a wedding contract between their children, Princess Glory of Lilliput and Prince David of Blefuscu, respectively. An argument starts over which national anthem is to be played at the wedding; the anthem of Lilliput (\"Faithful\") or the anthem of Blefuscu (\"Forever\"). In fury, King Bombo cancels the wedding and declares war against Liliput. He seems to consider changing his mind, but then Gabby rushes in, and a guard pursuing Gabby accidentally grabs Bombo, who takes it as an insult and storms off.\n\nGabby tells King Little of the \"giant\", and leads a mob to the beach to capture him. There, the Lilliputians tie Gulliver to a wagon and convey him to the town. The next morning, Gulliver awakens and breaks himself free, terrifying the Lilliputians. The Blefuscuian fleet arrives at Lilliput and starts firing upon the castle. Seeing Gulliver laughing at him, Bombo panics and orders a hasty retreat. Realizing that they can use Gulliver as a weapon, the Lilliputians start to treat him with hospitality and even make him a new set of clothes (\"It's A Hap-Hap Happy Day\").\n\nBack in Blefuscu, King Bombo is embarrassed by the defeat, and orders his three spies in Lilliput - Sneak, Snoop and Snitch - to \"get rid of that giant or else.\" Meanwhile, in celebration of the defeat, the Lilliputians treat Gulliver to dinner and a show (\"Bluebirds in the Moonlight\"). When the Lilliputians fall asleep after the show, Gulliver walks to the shore, unaware that his pistol has been taken, and reminisces about sailing (\"I Hear A Dream (Come Home)\"). The next day, after some horseplay with Gabby, Gulliver notices a building on fire and uses a nearby stream to put it out, not realizing he just saved the spies who wish to kill him. Later that night, Prince David sneaks back into Lilliput to visit Princess Glory. Gabby overhears the Prince singing a reprise of \"Forever\" and, mistaking him for a spy, orders the guards to attack the prince. Noticing this, Gulliver picks up David and Glory in his hands, and they tell him of the war's cause. Gulliver suggests that they combine \"Faithful\" and \"Forever\" into one song.\n\nIn Blefuscu, Bombo receives a message from his spies assuring him that Gulliver will be a \"dead duck\" whenever he gives the word, and he announces by carrier pigeon that he will attack at dawn. Gabby intercepts this message and warns the Lilliputians. Because of this, the spies aren't aware of the order until they capture Gabby just as the Lilliputians are marching to the beach (\"We're All Together Now\"). They hastily prepare Gulliver's pistol. As the Blefuscuian fleet approaches Lilliput, Gulliver demands they lay down their arms and settle matters peaceably. When they continue shooting, he ties the Blefuscuian ships together using their anchors and draws them to shore, saving any men who fall overboard in the process to show he means no ill will. The spies aim and fire at Gulliver from a cliff, but Prince David diverts the shot and, while doing so, falls to his apparent death. Using David's body to illustrate his point, Gulliver scolds both Lilliput and Blefuscu for their senseless fighting. While they solemnize a truce, Gulliver reveals that David is unharmed, whereupon David and Glory sing their combined song for everyone to hear (\"Faithful Forever\"). Both sides thereafter build a new ship for Gulliver, and he sails off into the sunset (\"Come Home Reprise\").\n\n==Cast==\n* Sam Parker as Gulliver\n* [[Pinto Colvig]] as Gabby, Gulliver (water gurgling sounds)<ref>{{cite book |last1=Grandinetti |first1=Fred M. |title=Jack Mercer, the Voice of Popeye |publisher=BearManor Media |page=56 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8p9fDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT56 |access-date=30 June 2022 |language=en}}</ref>\n* [[Jack Mercer]] as Prince David,<ref>{{cite web |title=Animation Profiles: Cal Howard {{!}} |url=https://cartoonresearch.com/index.php/animation-profiles-cal-howard/ |website=cartoonresearch.com |access-date=30 June 2022 |quote=Devon, Cal Howard did not provide the dialogue for Prince David in GULLIVER\u2019S TRAVELS.

However, after the success of Walt Disney Productions' ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]'', Paramount wanted to duplicate the Disney success and ordered a feature for a 1939 Christmas release, which would be Paramount's very first animated feature. When the story was first written in New York, [[Popeye the Sailor]] had originally been cast as Gulliver. This was scrapped, however, and the story was restructured once the West Coast team of [[Cal Howard]], [[Tedd Pierce]], and [[Edmond Seward]] came aboard (although Popeye would later be cast as a Gulliver-like character in an abridged version of the story called \"Popeye's Travels\", made for the 1960s ''[[Popeye the Sailor (TV series)|Popeye the Sailor]]'' television show).\n\nOne of the major challenges for Fleischer Studios was the 18-month delivery envelope, coming at a time when Fleischer Studios was relocating to Miami, Florida. While ''Snow White'' was in production for 18 months, it had been in development for just as long, allowing for a total of three years to reach the screen. To meet this deadline, the Fleischer staff was greatly expanded to some 800 employees. Animation training classes were set up with Miami art schools as a conduit for additional workers. Experienced lead animators were lured from [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] studios, including Nelson Demorest, Joe D'Igalo, and former Fleischer Animators [[Grim Natwick]], [[Al Eugster]], and [[Shamus Culhane]], who returned after working for the [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Walt Disney Studios]].\n\nSeveral West Coast techniques were introduced in order to provide better animation and greater personality in the characters. Some animators adapted while others did not. Pencil tests were unheard of in New York but were soon embraced as a tool for improving production methods. While the majority of the characters were animated through conventional animation techniques, [[rotoscoping]] was used to animate Gulliver, Glory, and David. Sam Parker, the voice of Gulliver, also modeled for the live-action reference.\n\nThe rushed schedule seemed to take precedence over quality, and overtime was the order of the day. Even with the rush, deadlines were compromised with Paramount considering canceling the film. Relations with the Technicolor lab were strained due to these constant delays largely associated with the remote location of Miami.\n\nFleischer Studios delivered ''Gulliver'' for Paramount's planned Christmas release schedule, opening in New York on December 20, 1939, going into general release two days later. Considering the potential demonstrated in the two Popeye specials, ''Gulliver's Travels'' lacked the built-in brand recognition of those shorts. This much-anticipated feature produced by Max Fleischer was still met with by an eager public and started out well, breaking box-office records in spite of the inevitable comparisons to ''Snow White''.\n\nBased on the overwhelming business success of ''Gulliver's Travels'' in its opening run, Barney Balaban immediately ordered another feature for a 1941 Christmas release. In spite of running over the original budget, Paramount made a profit of at least $1,000,000 domestically.<ref>Pointer, Ray (2016). ''The Art and Inventions of Max Fleischer: American Animation Pioneer'', McFarland & Co. Publishers. Pg.248-264</ref>\n\n==Vocal talent==\nThe voice cast consisted of a variety of performers. The voice of Gabby was provided by [[Pinto Colvig]], who had previously worked at Disney. Colvig had previously been the voice of [[Goofy]], provided vocal effects for [[Pluto (Disney)|Pluto]], was the stern Practical Pig in ''[[The Three Little Pigs (film)|The Three Little Pigs]]'', and voiced Grumpy and Sleepy in ''Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs''. [[Jack Mercer]], who portrayed King Little of Lilliput, was a story man for Fleischer's who lent his voice to the gruff [[Popeye the Sailor]]. In addition to voicing King Little, Mercer was also the voice behind Bombo's spies, Sneak, Snoop, and Snitch. Mercer was a regular voice heard in Fleischer and [[Famous Studios]] cartoons, and worked for Paramount until Famous Studios was dissolved. [[Jessica Dragonette]] and [[Lanny Ross]] were both popular singers of the day, and were hired to sing for Princess Glory and Prince David, respectively. Sam Parker was a radio announcer in the 1930s who won the role of Gulliver in a radio contest. When the Fleischers met Parker, they felt that his appearance was suitable for him to also perform in the live action footage that would be rotoscoped to create Gulliver's movement.<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0662603/bio Sam Parker (I) - Biography<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> [[Tedd Pierce]] was a story man hired away from [[Leon Schlesinger Productions]] to join Fleischer in their trip to Miami. Pierce, who would occasionally do voices for some of the characters in the cartoons, played King Bombo.\n\n==Release==\nLike ''Snow White'' before it, ''Gulliver'' was a success at the box-office, earning $3.27 million in the United States during its original run, even as it was limited to fifty theaters during the 1939 Christmas season.<ref>[http://www.ultimatemovierankings.com/top-grossing-movies-of-1939/ Top Grossing Movies of 1939|Ultimate Movie Rankings]</ref> This box-office success prompted a second feature to be ordered for a Christmas 1941 release, ''[[Mr. Bug Goes to Town]]''. Following its domestic run, ''Gulliver's Travels'' went into foreign release starting in February 1940.\n\nIn spite of the profits earned domestically and internationally, Paramount held Fleischer Studios to a $350,000 penalty for going over budget. This was the beginning of the financial difficulties Fleischer Studios encountered as it entered the 1940s.\n\nWhen the Fleischer film library was sold to television in 1955, ''Gulliver's Travels'' was included and became a local television station holiday film shown during the Thanksgiving and Christmas holidays. It was also re-released theatrically in Technicolor prints for Saturday matinee children's programs well into the mid-1960s.\n\nIn October 2012, the [[Turner Classic Movies]] channel debuted the film, transferred from an original 35mm Technicolor release print owned by the [[Museum of Modern Art Department of Film]], for the first time on television in a special hosted by [[Robert Osborne]] and [[Jerry Beck]] dedicated to rare animated films, including ''[[Mr. Bug Goes to Town]]'', Lotte Reiniger's ''[[The Adventures of Prince Achmed]]'', the [[UPA (animation studio)|UPA]] cartoons and the silent cartoons of 1907 to 1932 of the New York Studios.\n\n==Home media==\nDue to the film's [[public domain]] status, it has been released by many distributors in various [[home video]] formats.\n[[Entertainment One|E1 Entertainment]] released the film on [[Blu-ray Disc]] on March 10, 2009, but received strong criticism for presenting the movie in a stretched and cropped 1.75:1 format, as well as applying heavy noise reduction.<ref>[http://www.dvdbeaver.com/film2/DVDReviews44/gullivers_travels_blu-ray.htm DVD Beaver]</ref><ref>[https://www.dvdverdict.com/reviews/gulliverstravels1939.php DVD Verdict] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090426011051/http://www.dvdverdict.com/reviews/gulliverstravels1939.php |date=April 26, 2009 }}</ref><ref>[http://animated-views.com/2009/fleischers-travels-blu-ray-disc/ Animated Views]</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Kehr|first1=Dave|title=Classics From Disney and a Lilliputian Competitor|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/08/movies/homevideo/08dkehr.html|access-date=March 7, 2016|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=March 6, 2009}}</ref>\nIn March 2014, Thunderbean Animation released a superior restored version of the film with several Fleischer Studios shorts in a Blu-ray/[[DVD]] combo pack titled ''Fleischer Classics Featuring Gulliver's Travels''.<ref>[http://cartoonresearch.com/index.php/gulliver-comes-to-bluray/ \"Gulliver\" Comes To BluRay|Cartoon Research]</ref><ref>[http://www.blu-ray.com/movies/Fleischer-Classics-Featuring-Gullivers-Travels-Blu-ray/82468/#Review Blu-ray.com]</ref>\n\n==Awards==\nThe film was nominated for two [[Academy Awards]]:\n* Victor Young for [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Best Music, Original Score]]\n* Ralph Rainger (music) and Leo Robin (lyrics) for [[Academy Award for Best Original Song|Best Music, Original Song]] (\"Faithful Forever\")\n\nThe film lost both awards to [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]'s ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]''.<ref>[https://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/1940 1940|Oscars.org]</ref>\n\n==Spin-off cartoons==\nThe film was spun off into two short-lived Fleischer cartoon short series: the ''[[Gabby (film series)|Gabby]]'' series<ref>{{cite book |last1=Lenburg |first1=Jeff |title=The Encyclopedia of Animated Cartoons |date=1999 |publisher=Checkmark Books |isbn=0-8160-3831-7 |access-date=June 6, 2020 |url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780816038312/page/83/mode/2up |page=83}}</ref> and the ''[[Animated Antics]]'' cartoons starring the three spies, ''Sneak, Snoop and Snitch'' and ''Twinkletoes'' (the carrier pigeon).\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of animated feature films]]\n* [[1939 in film]]\n\n==Further reading==\n* [[Michael Barrier (historian)|Barrier, Michael]] (1999).
