The film is a contemporary fable loosely based on [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]]'s 1866 novel ''[[Crime and Punishment]]''.\n\n==Plot==\nRoseanne is outwardly a perfect and popular teen, but she suffers from a dysfunctional home life. Her mother begins an affair with Chris, a local man, and leaves her to live alone with her alcoholic stepfather Fred. One night during an alcohol-fueled rage, Fred rapes Roseanne.  Traumatized, she decides to take things into her own hands. With the assistance of her devoted and clueless boyfriend Jimmy, she murders her stepfather in retribution. Afterwards, Roseanne's conscience quickly begins to unravel.\n\nThe story is narrated by one of Roseanne's classmates, Vincent, a boy who is as concerned with Roseanne's well-being as he is obsessed with her. As the plot develops, he forges a relationship with her, consoling her and giving her advice while trying to point her toward redemption. In the end it becomes possible that he will be her only salvation.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n*[[Monica Keena]] as Roseanne Skolnick\n*[[Ellen Barkin]] as Maggie Skolnick\n*[[Michael Ironside]] as Fred Skolnick\n*[[Vincent Kartheiser]] as Vincent\n*James DeBello as Jimmy\n*[[Jeffrey Wright (actor)|Jeffrey Wright]] as Chris\n*[[Conchata Ferrell]] as Bella\n*[[Marshall Teague (actor)|Marshall Teague]] as Coach\n*[[Nicki Aycox]] as Cecil\n*[[Bonnie Somerville]] as Stuck Up Girl\n*[[Lucinda Jenney]] as Vincent's Mom\n*[[Blake Shields]] as Moznick (as Blake C.
