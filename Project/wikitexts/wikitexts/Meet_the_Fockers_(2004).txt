The film stars [[Robert De Niro]] (who was also one of the film's producers), [[Ben Stiller]], [[Dustin Hoffman]], [[Barbra Streisand]], [[Blythe Danner]] and [[Teri Polo]]. Despite mixed reviews, the film was a box office hit, grossing $522 million worldwide. It was followed by a sequel, ''[[Little Fockers]]'', in 2010.\n\n==Plot==\nTwo years after the events of the [[Meet the Parents|first film]], Gaylord \"Greg\" Focker and his fianc\u00e9e Pam Byrnes decide to introduce their parents to each other. They first fly to [[Oyster Bay (hamlet), New York|Oyster Bay, New York]], to pick up Pam's father, retired CIA operative Jack Byrnes, her mother Dina, and Pam's infant nephew, Jack \u201cLittle Jack\u201d Banks. Rather than going to the airport as planned, Jack decides to drive the family to [[Miami]] to meet Greg's parents in his new [[Recreational vehicle|RV]].\n\nOnce Greg, Pam, and Pam\u2019s parents arrive in Miami, they are greeted by Greg's eccentric but fun-loving and amiable father, Bernie Focker, a lawyer-turned-stay-at-home-dad, and Greg's mother, Roz, who is a sex therapist for elderly couples. While Dina bonds with the Fockers, small cracks begin to form between Jack and the Fockers, due to their contrasting personalities. The gathering gets off to a bad start when a chase between the Fockers' dog, Moses, and the Byrneses' cat, Jinx, culminates with Jinx flushing Moses down the RV's toilet, forcing Bernie to destroy it to save Moses. Later, Bernie accidentally injures Jack's back during a game of [[touch football (American)|touch football]].\n\nPam informs Greg that she is pregnant, and the two decide to keep it a secret until they are married. Jack again becomes suspicious of Greg's character when they are introduced to the Fockers' former housekeeper, Isabel Villalobos. Bernie reveals that Greg lost his virginity to Isabel 15 years earlier. Isabel's 15-year-old son Jorge, who has never met his father and bears a striking resemblance to Greg, catches the attention of Jack. Meanwhile, Roz, Bernie and Dina realize Pam is pregnant, but promise not to tell Jack.\n\nGreg is left alone to babysit Little Jack, whom Jack has been raising via the [[Ferber method]]. Despite Jack's strict instructions to leave Little Jack to self-soothe, Greg is unable to stand listening to Little Jack's cries and attempts to cheer him up by hugging him and acting humorously, but inadvertently teaches him the word \"asshole\". Greg answers a brief phone call from Roz, and Little Jack is let out of the [[playpen]] by Jinx and he glues his hands to a bottle of [[rum]]. Jack resumes his spying on Greg and sends Greg and Jorge's hair samples for a DNA test, while inviting Jorge to Greg and Pam's engagement party in hopes of getting Greg to admit he is Jorge's father. At the engagement party, Jack, who assumes that Greg knows about Jorge and has deliberately been keeping him a secret from Pam, introduces him to Jorge. Later, when Greg denies knowing anything about Jorge, Jack still refuses to believe him and drugs him with a shot of [[truth serum]]. While giving a toast, Greg uncontrollably blurts out that Pam is pregnant and that Jorge is his son before immediately [[unconsciousness|losing consciousness]].\n\nThe next morning, Pam questions Greg about Jorge, and Greg promises that he knew nothing about him before the previous evening. Pam believes him, and is willing to work things out with him. Jack has reached his breaking point and demands that Pam and Dina leave with him. Dina refuses and reveals to everyone that Jack had drugged Greg. Everyone turns against Jack and inform him that they were all aware of Pam's pregnancy. A shocked and hurt Jack leaves with his grandson.\n\nBernie and Greg pursue Jack, but are tasered and arrested by Officer Vern LeFlore for speeding and refusing to remain in Bernie\u2019s car when pulled over. Meanwhile, Jack receives the results of the DNA test that determines Jorge's father is really a baseball player who also resembles Greg. When Jack sees Bernie and Greg being pulled over, he attempts to defend them, but LeFlore tasers and arrests him as well. In their cell, Greg, Jack, and Bernie are released by Judge Ira, a client of Roz. Before they leave, Greg asks that Jack and Bernie stop their feud. Jack admits that he made a mistake regarding Jorge and reveals his past career in the CIA to Bernie before apologizing for his actions. Greg and Pam are married that weekend by Pam's former fianc\u00e9, Kevin, who is now an ordained interfaith minister.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast list|\n* [[Robert De Niro]] as Jack Byrnes\n* [[Ben Stiller]] as Greg Focker\n* [[Dustin Hoffman]] as Bernie Focker\n* [[Barbra Streisand]] as Roz Focker\n* [[Blythe Danner]] as Dina Byrnes\n* [[Teri Polo]] as Pam Byrnes\n* [[Owen Wilson]] as Kevin Rawley\n* Spencer Pickren and Bradley Pickren as Jack \u201cLittle Jack\u201d Banks\n* [[Alanna Ubach]] as Isabel Villalobos\n* [[Ray Santiago]] as Jorge Villalobos\n* [[Tim Blake Nelson]] as Officer Vern LeFlore\n* [[Shelley Berman]] as Judge Ira\n* [[Cedric Yarbrough]] as Prison guard\n}}\n\n== Reception ==\n\n=== Critical response ===\n[[Rotten Tomatoes]] reported that 38% of 164 sampled critics gave ''Meet the Fockers'' positive reviews, with an average rating of 5.20/10.
