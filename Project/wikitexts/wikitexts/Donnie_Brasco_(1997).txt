[[Michael Madsen]], [[Bruno Kirby]], [[James Russo]], and [[Anne Heche]] appeared in supporting roles. The film, written by [[Paul Attanasio]], is based on the 1988 nonfiction book ''[[Donnie Brasco: My Undercover Life in the Mafia]]'' by [[Joseph D. Pistone]] and Richard Woodley.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.oscars.org/awards/academyawards/oscarlegacy/1990-1999/70nominees.html| title = Nominees & Winners for the 70th Academy Awards &#124; Academy of Motion Picture Arts & Sciences| website = [[Oscars.org]]| access-date = May 6, 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe film is loosely based on the true story of Pistone (Depp), an [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] undercover agent who infiltrated the [[Bonanno crime family]] in [[New York City]] during the 1970s, under the alias [[Joseph D. Pistone|Donnie Brasco]], a jewel thief from [[Vero Beach, Florida]]. Brasco maneuvers his way into the confidence of an aging Mafia [[hitman]], [[Benjamin Ruggiero|Lefty Ruggiero]] (Pacino), who vouches for him. As Donnie moves deeper into the Mafia, he realizes that not only is he crossing the line between federal agent and criminal, but also leading his friend Lefty to an almost certain death.\n\n''Donnie Brasco'' premiered in Century City on February 24, 1997, and was released on February 28, 1997, by [[TriStar Pictures]]. The film was a box office success, earning $124.9 million against its $35 million budget, and received positive reviews from critics. The film was nominated for an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Adapted Screenplay]].\n\n== Plot ==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, the plot summary should be 400-700 words. -->\nIn 1978 New York City, [[Lefty Ruggiero]], an aging enforcer in the [[Bonanno crime family]], meets [[Joe Pistone]], a young undercover FBI agent posing as jewel thief \"Donnie Brasco\". Lefty asks Donnie to sell a diamond he acquired from a strip club owner, but Donnie insists that it's a fake. Insulted, Lefty takes Donnie to the man and demands an explanation. Donnie beats the owner and takes his [[Porsche]] as repayment. Lefty teaches Donnie the rules of the [[American Mafia|Mafia]] and introduces him to members of his crew, including [[Dominick Napolitano|Sonny Black]], Nicky, Paulie, and rival crew leader [[Alphonse Indelicato|Sonny Red]]. After the boss of the family is killed, Sonny receives a promotion, angering Lefty who feels his years of service make him more deserving. As the crew runs a series of successful shakedowns and hijackings in the city, Pistone exploits his position as Lefty's associate to gather information for the FBI via [[wiretap]] recordings. He also ends up forming a genuine bond with Lefty, who is struggling with family issues and a lifetime of debt.\n\nPistone is asked by his FBI supervisor to incorporate Miami-based undercover FBI Agent Richie Gazzo into the Donnie Brasco operation. He convinces Lefty to meet with Richie and set up an illegal gambling racket in a long-closed tavern he owns. Lefty hopes to impress the local mob boss, [[Santo Trafficante Jr.]], by throwing a yacht party and convincing him to support his new business. Sonny finds out about Lefty's plan and intercedes by ingratiating himself to Trafficante and officially taking Donnie under his wing. Lefty believes Donnie betrayed him and cuts ties with him until Lefty's son nearly dies of an overdose and Donnie is the only one who comes to comfort him. Pistone's marriage with his wife Maggie continues to worsen due to long absences while undercover, leaving her alone to look after their three daughters. Pistone's behavior increasingly becomes more like that of the criminal he pretends to be, even hitting Maggie when she talks back to him.\n\nOn its opening day, Sonny's club is raided by corrupt [[Miami Police Department|Miami Police]] officers on Trafficante's payroll as a favor for Sonny Red. Suspecting a setup, Sonny Black and his crew return to New York and gun down Sonny Red and two other mobsters in an ambush. Sonny Black also orders Lefty to kill Nicky for lying about a drug deal and suspecting he snitched on the crew in Florida. Donnie is brought in to help clean up and dispose of the bodies. Sonny Black becomes the new boss and orders Donnie to kill Sonny Red's son, Bruno, so that Donnie can officially become [[made man|a member]] of their family. Lefty finds Bruno's hideout and takes Donnie there. Donnie tries to offer Lefty a bag of money so he can leave the Mafia, but Lefty begins questioning his loyalty at gunpoint. The FBI intercedes before Donnie is forced to do anything, and the investigation ends.\n\nFBI agents visit Sonny Black's hangout and reveal Donnie's true identity to the crew. Knowing the fatal consequences that await him for unknowingly letting an FBI agent infiltrate the crime family, Lefty leaves behind his valuables and tells his wife that if Donnie calls to tell him \"if it was going to be anyone, I'm glad it was him\", before he is called to a meeting with his crew. With his family in attendance, Pistone attends a small private ceremony for his service, being awarded a medal and a $500 check.\n\nThe end title cards state that the evidence collected by Pistone in the Donnie Brasco operation led to over 200 indictments and over 100 convictions. Pistone lives with his wife under an assumed name in an undisclosed location, with a $500,000 open [[contract killing|contract]] on his head.\n\n== Cast ==\n<!--ACCORDING TO THE END CREDITS OF THE FILM per WP:FILMCAST-->\n{{cast list|\n* [[Al Pacino]] as [[Lefty Ruggiero|Lefty]]\n* [[Johnny Depp]] as [[Joseph D.
