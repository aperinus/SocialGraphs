It is based on the novel of the same name by [[Dmitri Furmanov]], a Russian writer and [[Bolshevik]] commissar who fought together with Chapayev.<ref>{{cite book|last=Rollberg|first=Peter|title=Historical Dictionary of Russian and Soviet Cinema|year=2008|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=978-0-8108-6268-5|page=132|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Cuw1vHuxITYC&q=russian+drama+Chapaev&pg=PA132}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Soviet Union-1964-stamp-Chapayev (film).jpg|150px|left|Stamp commemorating the 30th anniversary of ''Chapaev'']]\n\n==Plot==\n\nThe film centers around a Red Army division commanded by Vasily Chapayev in their fight against White Army troops commanded by Colonel Borodzin. A Commissar named Furmanov is delegated to the division from Moscow, and although he initially does not get along with Chapayev, he proves his worth by resolving a conflict that arises when Chapayev's men steal from local peasants and the two become good friends.\n\nWith the help of Chapayev's adjutant Petka and the machine gunner Anka (who develop a love interest over the course of the film), and with intelligence provided by Borodzin's defecting aide Petrovich, the division manages to repel an attack from the White Army troops.{{sfn|Stites|1992|p=86}}\n\nHigher \u2013 ups in Moscow re-assign Furmanov to another Red Army division, and the situation soon deteriorates. Under the cover of darkness, Borodzin and his men attack Chapayev's headquarters. Despite their heroic efforts, Petka and Chapayev are killed. Their sacrifices are avenged, however, as Anka alerts the rest of the division and a counterattack is shown to be successful in the final shots of the film.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:\u0427\u0430\u043f\u0430\u0435\u0432 \u043a\u0430\u0434\u0440 \u0411\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0447\u043a\u0438\u043d.jpg|thumb|[[Boris Babochkin]] as [[Vasily Chapayev]]]]\n*[[Boris Babochkin]] \u2013 [[Vasily Chapayev]]\n*[[Boris Blinov]] \u2013 [[Dmitry Furmanov]]\n*[[Varvara Myasnikova]] \u2013 Anka\n*[[Leonid Kmit]] \u2013 [[Pyotr Isaev|Petka]]\n*Illarion Pevtsov \u2013 Colonel Sergei Nikolayveitch Borozdin\n*Stepan Shkurat \u2013 Potapov (Petrovich), Borozdin's [[Batman (military)|batman]]\n*Vyacheslav Volkov \u2013 Elan Brigade Commander\n*[[Nikolay Simonov]] \u2013 platoon commander Zhiharev\n*Elena Volintseva \u2013 farmer\n*[[Boris Chirkov]] \u2013 farmer\n*[[Sergei Vasilyev]] \u2013 Lieutenant\n*[[Georgiy Zhzhonov]] \u2013 Teryosha's, Furmanov's orderly\n*[[Mikhail Rostovtsev (actor)|Mikhail Rostovtsev]] \u2013 Veterinarian\n*Andrei Apsolon \u2013 Red Army soldier\n*Stepan Krylov \u2013 Red Army soldier\n*[[Georgi Vasilyev]] \u2013 officer with a cigarette\n*Victor Yablonsky \u2013 Cossack Plastun (uncredited)\n*Emil Gal \u2013 vetfeldsher (uncredited)\n*Konstantin Nazarenko \u2013 trouble-making partisan (uncredited)\n*Pavel Leshkov \u2013 Borozdin's interlocutor (uncredited)\n\n==Style==\n\nChapayev follows the [[Socialist realism|socialist realist]] style, the dominant form of art in the Soviet Union during the time period. To maintain a \"realistic\" depiction of the world, the camera work is predictable and repetitive, almost mechanical.\n\nThe relationship between Chapayev and Furmanov, which is central to the plot of the film, is typical for a Soviet socialist realist film. Both men are supremely competent in their respective roles as commander and commissar. Chapayev is a heroic figure who represents the common Russian man; he is uneducated, he swears, and he acts disorderly. In contrast, Furmanov, who represents the Party and Communist ideology, is more orderly and domineering; in scenes where the two interact, Furmanov is positioned higher in the frame to indicate his superior status.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Bulgakova|first1=Oksana|title=The Elements and Consciousness: The Commander and the Commissar|date=2013|publisher=Academic Studies Press|location=Boston|pages=242\u2013245}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n\n''Chapaev'' premiered on 6 November 1934, in the [[Leningrad]] cinema \"Titan\"; it quickly became one of the most popular films in the Soviet Union.
