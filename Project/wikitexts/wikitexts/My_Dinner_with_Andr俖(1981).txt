The actors play fictionalized versions of themselves sharing a conversation at [[Caf\u00e9 des Artistes]] in [[Manhattan]]. The film's dialogue covers topics such as [[experimental theatre]], the nature of theatre, and the nature of life, and contrasts Wally's modest [[humanism]] with Andre's [[spiritual experience]]s.\n\n== Structure ==\nAndre Gregory is the focus of the first hour of the film, when he describes some of his experiences since giving up his career as a theatre director in 1975. These include working with his friend, director [[Jerzy Grotowski]], and a group of Polish actors in a forest in [[Poland]], his visit to [[Findhorn Ecovillage|Findhorn]] in Scotland, and his trip to the [[Sahara]] to try to create a play based on ''[[The Little Prince]]'' by [[Antoine de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry|Saint-Exup\u00e9ry]]. He worked with a group in a small piece of [[performance art]] on [[Long Island]], which resulted in Andre's being (briefly) [[Premature burial#Voluntary|buried alive]] on [[Halloween]] night.\n\nThe rest of the film is a conversation as Wally Shawn tries to argue that living life as Andre has done for the past five years is simply not possible for most people. He relates ordinary pleasures, like having a cup of coffee. Andre responds that what passes for normal life in New York in the late 1970s is more akin to living in a dream than it is to real life. The movie ends without a clear resolution to the conflict in worldviews articulated by the two men. Wally reminisces during a taxi ride about his childhood and mentions that when he arrives at home, he tells his girlfriend Debbie about his dinner with Andre. [[Erik Satie]]'s ''[[Gymnop\u00e9dies|Gymnop\u00e9die No. 1]]'' plays in the background.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Andr\u00e9 Gregory]] as Andre\n* [[Wallace Shawn]] as Wally\n* Jean Lenauer as waiter\n* Roy Butler<!--- not the politician ---> as bartender\n* Cindy Adkins as hatcheck girl\n\n== Production ==\nThe idea for the film arose from Gregory's effort to work with a biographer on his life story, and Shawn's simultaneously coming up with an idea for a story about two people having a conversation.<ref name=\"Criterion\" /><ref name=\"AVClub\" /> Gregory and Shawn, who had become friends through theatre work, decided to collaborate on the project. They agreed that it should be filmed rather than produced as a play.<ref name=Criterion /> Although the film was based on events in the actors' lives, Shawn and Gregory denied (in an interview with film critic [[Roger Ebert]]) that they were playing themselves. They said that, if they remade the film, they would swap the two characters to prove their point. In an interview with [[Noah Baumbach]] in 2009, Shawn said:\n\n{{blockquote|I actually had a purpose as I was writing this: I wanted to destroy that guy that I played, to the extent that there was any of ''me'' there. I wanted to kill that side of myself by making the film, because that guy is totally motivated by fear.<ref name=\"wally\" />}}\n\nThe screenplay went through numerous developmental changes in location; in the final version, it was set during a dinner at a restaurant. While Shawn was trying to find someone to direct the film, he received a phone call from French director [[Louis Malle]]. He had read a copy of the screenplay via a mutual friend and insisted that he work on the project, saying he wanted to direct, produce the film, or work on it in any capacity.<ref name=Criterion /><ref name=AVClub /> Shawn initially thought that the call was a prank, due to Malle's stature in film. Malle later suggested that the dinner setup would not work, based on a rehearsal where Gregory was talking while eating.<ref name=Criterion /> Shawn argued throughout screenplay development for more scenes, which would have resulted in a three-hour film. Malle won many script cuts, but lost two arguments over scenes that were kept in the film.<ref name=Criterion />\n\n''My Dinner with Andre'' was filmed in December 1980 in the [[Jefferson Hotel (Richmond, Virginia)|Jefferson Hotel]], which was then vacant, in [[Richmond, Virginia]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://m.styleweekly.com/richmond/talking-heads/Content?oid=17031997|title=Talking Heads|work=[[Style Weekly]]|date=26 January 2021}}</ref> (the hotel has since been restored and reopened as a luxury venue). [[Lloyd Kaufman]] was the production manager on the film, and [[Troma Entertainment]] provided production support.<ref name=\"damn\" /><ref name=\"fifty\" /><ref name=\"spin\" /> The filming was done over a period of two weeks, and edited to appear as if occurring in real time.
