It was written by [[Tim Herlihy]] and [[Adam Sandler]] and produced by [[Robert Simonds]] and [[Jack Giarraputo]].\n\n[[Lynn Swann]], [[Lawrence Taylor]], [[Jimmy Johnson (American football coach)|Jimmy Johnson]], [[Bill Cowher]], [[Big Show|Paul \"The Big Show\" Wight]], and [[Rob Schneider]] have cameo appearances. The film was extremely profitable, earning $39.4&nbsp;million in its opening weekend alone in the United States,<ref name=\"Box Office Mojo\" /> earning a total of $186&nbsp;million worldwide.\n\n== Plot ==\n{{Long plot|date=January 2021}}\nRobert \"Bobby\" Boucher Jr. is a socially inept, [[stuttering]], and somewhat mentally challenged 31-year-old man serving as the [[water boy]] for the University of Louisiana football program.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Waterboy (1998) - Plot Summary|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120484/plotsummary|website=IMDb.com|access-date=January 1, 2021}}</ref> He lives with his overprotective and extremely religious mother, Helen, and believes his father, Robert Sr., died of [[dehydration]] in the [[Sahara]] while serving in the [[Peace Corps]] back in the 1960s.\n\nAs the players constantly bully Bobby, the Cougars' head coach, Red Beaulieu, fires Bobby for being \"disruptive\" during the 18 years of his employment. Bobby approaches Coach Klein of the South-Central Louisiana State University Mud Dogs and is hired as the team's water boy.\n\nThe Mud Dogs have lost 40 consecutive games, their cheerleaders are alcoholics, and players are forced to share equipment due to budget cuts. When the new team teases him, Klein encourages Bobby to stand up for himself. Remembering all the bullying he has put up with over the years, Bobby tackles the team's [[quarterback]], knocking him out. Seeing Boucher's potential, Klein meets with Helen and tries to persuade her to let Bobby play on the team, but she refuses, saying it is too dangerous.\n\nKlein convinces Bobby to play anyway, seeing that Bobby is eager to attend college. Bobby becomes a feared [[linebacker]] and the Mud Dogs go on a winning streak. Bobby's newfound fame and confidence also allow him to reconnect with his [[felonious]] childhood crush, Vicki Vallencourt. Helen forbids Bobby from seeing her, warning him that girls (along with everything else in pop culture) \"is the devil\".\n\nThe team's success earns it a trip to the annual [[bowl game|Bourbon Bowl]] on [[New Year's Day]] to face the Cougars and Coach Beaulieu. However, Beaulieu and his team crash the Mud Dogs' [[pep rally]] and reveal that the high school Bobby went to doesn't exist and that he was [[homeschooled]], and his fake high school transcript makes him ineligible for college and football. The team and fans turn against Bobby, believing him to be a liar and cheater.\n\nCoach Klein convinces the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] to let Bobby play if he can pass a [[General Educational Development|GED]] exam. He apologizes to Bobby and admits to submitting the fake transcript because he was desperate to get even with Beaulieu. Twenty years ago, Klein and Beaulieu were assistant coaches at the University of Louisiana. After Beaulieu stole and took credit for Klein\u2019s playbook, he was promoted, and Klein was fired. Klein suffered a mental breakdown and became [[writer's block|unable to come up with new plays]]. The story convinces Bobby to help Klein get revenge on Beaulieu and prove himself to everyone. Bobby finally stands up to Helen while studying for the GED, angrily revealing that he has been playing football, going to college, and seeing Vicki, and intends to continue doing so.\n\nBobby passes the exam, but Helen feigns a coma. Feeling he drove his mother to illness; Bobby stays in the hospital with her. Meanwhile, Vicki leads a gathering of fans to the hospital to convince him to play. Seeing her son struggling to ignore his calling, Helen ends her fake illness. She tells Bobby the truth about his father, Robert Sr., who abandoned her while she was four months pregnant with Bobby to have an affair with a voodoo priestess in [[New Orleans]]. This led to Helen being constantly afraid that Bobby would leave her too. Deciding to put her son's happiness ahead of her own selfishness, she encourages him to play in the Bourbon Bowl.\n\nArriving at halftime, Bobby finds the Mud Dogs losing by a score of 27\u20130. Using the same technique of \"visualizing and attacking\" as Klein taught Bobby, Bobby then turns the lesson back on him; Klein overcomes his fear of Beaulieu and comes up with new plays. The Mud Dogs begin to catch up, unsettling Beaulieu, who resorts to underhanded tactics to save his and the team's honor. The Mud Dogs win the Bourbon Bowl, 30\u201327, and Bobby is named the game's [[Most Valuable Player|MVP]], all to the devastation of Beaulieu and the Cougars.\n\nSometime later, Bobby and Vicki get married. Robert Sr., who has since changed his name to Roberto, makes a surprise appearance to convince Bobby to skip school and go to the [[National Football League|NFL]] so he can share in his son's newfound fame. He is tackled to the ground by an enraged Helen to the cheers of the attendants. Bobby and Vicki leave on his lawn mower to consummate their marriage.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Adam Sandler]] as Bobby Boucher, Jr.\n* [[Kathy Bates]] as Helen \"Mama\" Boucher\n* [[Henry Winkler]] as Coach Klein\n* [[Fairuza Balk]] as Vicki Vallencourt\n* [[Jerry Reed]] as Coach Red Beaulieu\n* [[Peter Dante]] as Gee Grenouille\n* [[Larry Gilliard Jr.]] as Derek Wallace\n* [[Blake Clark]] as Farmer Fran, whose heavy, thick Cajun accent no one seems to understand.
