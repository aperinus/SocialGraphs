Burnett]] and [[John Huston]] from the novel by Burnett, and starring [[Ida Lupino]] and [[Humphrey Bogart]]. Its plot follows a career criminal who becomes involved in a jewel heist in a resort town in California's [[Sierra Nevada]], along with a young former [[taxi dance hall|taxi dancer]] (Lupino).\n\nParts of the film were shot on location at [[Whitney Portal, California|Whitney Portal]], halfway up [[Mount Whitney]].\n\nThe screenplay was co-written by John Huston, Bogart's friend and drinking partner, adapted from the novel by William R. Burnett (also known for, among others, ''[[Little Caesar (film)|Little Caesar]]'' and ''[[Scarface (1932 film)|Scarface]]'').{{sfn|Sperber|Lax|1997|p=119}} The film cemented a strong personal and professional connection between Bogart and Huston,{{sfn|Meyers|1997|p=115}} and provided the breakthrough in Bogart's career, transforming him from supporting player to leading man. The film's success also led to a breakthrough for Huston, providing him with the leverage he needed to make the transition from screenwriter to director, which he made later that year with his adaptation of ''[[The Maltese Falcon (1941 film)|The Maltese Falcon]]'' (1941), starring Bogart.\n\nThe film contains extensive location shooting, especially in the climactic final scenes, as the authorities pursue Bogart's character, gangster \"Mad Dog\" Roy Earle, from [[Lone Pine, California|Lone Pine]] up to the foot of the mountain.\n\n==Plot==\nAn aged gangster, Big Mac, is planning a robbery at a fashionable [[California]] resort hotel in the resort town of Tropico Springs in the [[Sierra Nevada]]. He wants the heist led by convicted bank robber Roy Earle, whose recent release from an [[Indiana]] prison was the result of Big Mac's bribing the governor. Roy drives cross-country to an abandoned logging camp in the mountains to meet with the three men who will assist him in the heist: Louis Mendoza, who works as a clerk in the hotel, Red, and Babe, who are already living at the camp. Babe has brought along his girlfriend Marie Garson, a [[Taxi dance hall|dance hall]] performer from [[Los Angeles]].\n\nDeriding Marie's involvement, Roy insists she return to her home in [[San Francisco]], but after an argument, he agrees to her staying. At the camp, Algernon, a handyman, introduces Roy to Pard, a small dog to whom he takes a liking. Roy decides to adopt the dog. Meanwhile, Marie falls in love with Roy, but he does not reciprocate. In [[Tropico Springs]], Roy witnesses a minor car accident involving Ma and Pa Goodhue and their granddaughter Velma, a young woman with a [[clubbed foot]] who walks with a limp. Swiftly enamored with Velma, Roy pays for corrective surgery to allow her to walk normally, despite her grandfather's warning that Velma is engaged. While she is recovering, Roy asks Velma to marry him, but she refuses, explaining that she is devoted to her fianc\u00e9, Lon.\n\nThe group execute the heist at the hotel, but it goes awry when they are interrupted by a security guard. Roy makes his getaway with Marie, but Mendoza, Red, and Babe are involved in a car crash, killing Red and Babe. Mendoza is captured, and the police question him. Roy and Marie drive to [[Los Angeles]] with the jewels, only to find that Big Mac has died of a [[heart attack]] and that Jake Kranmer, an ex-policeman, has taken over the operation. Kranmer tries to force Roy to give him the jewels, but a defiant Roy shoots him to death.\n\nBack in Tropico Springs, Roy visits Velma, having promised her he would come to see her able to walk. He then meets with a [[Fence (criminal)|fence]] who is to exchange money for the stolen jewels, but the man tells Roy he cannot pay him the $30,000 immediately. While the \"fence\" looks after the jewels, Roy and Marie go into hiding at a hotel, but they panic when Roy's name and face make newspaper headlines, along with mentions of Marie and their dog, Pard.\n\nDeciding that he would be safer on his own, Roy sends Marie to [[Las Vegas]] by bus. He returns to Los Angeles to exchange the jewels. However, he is forced to change direction upon  noticing that police have set up [[roadblock]]s. Roy is pursued by police back into the mountains, where he is forced to abandon his car and flee on foot. Marie hears a news broadcast about the chase. She is subsequently interrogated by investigators, who try to persuade her to lure Roy out of hiding. She refuses, however, aware that Roy would rather die than return to prison. Regardless, she is forced to accompany the authorities on their search in the mountains. Meanwhile, Roy hides out behind a large rock on the mountainside.\n\nAt dawn, Pard escapes the police encampment and runs to locates Roy, who is suddenly distracted by the dog's barking. Assuming Marie has found him, Roy runs out onto a precipice, calling her name, only to be killed by a [[Marksman|sharpshooter]] from above. Marie watches in horror from below as Roy's body topples down the mountain peak. Followed by officers, Marie rushes to Roy's body, as does Pard, who lies down next to him. As Marie is escorted away with Pard, she takes small comfort in knowing that Roy will not have to again face prison. She wanted to know what it meant for a guy to crash out, which is what Roy talked about. She asked Healy what it meant, and he said it meant to be free. Marie smiled, knowing that Roy was free of his troubles.\n\n==Cast==\n\n* [[Ida Lupino]] as Marie Garson\n* [[Humphrey Bogart]] as Roy \"Mad Dog\" Earle/Roy Collins\n* [[Alan Curtis (American actor)|Alan Curtis]] as Babe Kozak\n* [[Arthur Kennedy]] as Red Hattery\n* [[Joan Leslie]] as Velma\n* [[Henry Hull]] as Doc Banton\n* [[Henry Travers]] as Pa Goodhue\n* [[Jerome Cowan]] as Healy\n* [[Minna Gombell]] as Mrs. Baughman\n* [[Barton MacLane]] as Jake Kranmer\n* [[Donald MacBride]] as Big Mac\n* [[Willie Best]] as Algernon\n* Zero as Pard\n* [[Elisabeth Risdon]] as Ma Goodhue\n* [[Cornel Wilde]] as Louis Mendoza\n* [[Paul Harvey (actor)|Paul Harvey]] as Mr. Baughman\n* [[Isabel Jewell]] as Blonde\n* [[Spencer Charters]] as Ed\n* [[George Meeker]] as Pfiffer\n* Robert Strange as Art\n* [[John Eldredge (actor)|John Eldredge]] as Lon Preiser\n* Sam Hayes as Announcer\n* [[Eddie Acuff]] as Bus Driver\n\n==Themes==\nLuke Goodsell, writing for ''[[Senses of Cinema]]'', writes that ''High Sierra'' presents its heist narrative as \"something of a grasp for the fabled new America.

Superbly played by Actor Bogart, Earle is a complex human being, a farmer boy who turned mobster, a gunman with a string of murders on his record who still is shocked when newsmen call him \"Mad-Dog\" Earle. He is kind to the mongrel dog (Zero) that travels with him, befriends a [[taxi dancer]] (Ida Lupino) who becomes his [[Gun moll|moll]], and goes out of his way to help a crippled girl (Joan Leslie).
