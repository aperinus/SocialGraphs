The film stars [[Jennifer Jason Leigh]], [[Bug Hall]], [[Mischa Barton]], [[Brad Renfro]] and [[Drew Barrymore]], reprising her role from ''[[Motorama (film)|Motorama]]'' (1991).\n\nAfter making the film-festival rounds in 2000, the film had a limited release by Trimark Pictures. It was filmed in [[Indian Head, Saskatchewan]], [[Regina, Saskatchewan]], [[Fort Qu'Appelle, Saskatchewan]] and [[Regina Beach, Saskatchewan]].\n\n== Plot ==\nIn 1963, [[Liberalism|liberal]]-minded and reckless Lydia Callahan is raising her 14-year-old son, Sam. Lydia's father Caspar, a prominent local businessman, is running for [[governor of North Carolina]], and does not want Lydia and Sam in his way, so the two are banished from [[North Carolina]]. They travel across the country and settle in [[Wyoming]], where Lydia only wants to have a good time and refuses to allow Sam to call her \"mom.\"\n\nSam soon finds out that he is one of only two students in Gro Vont High School who read. The other one is Maurey, a girl the same age as Sam who wants to learn about sex. Consequent to their mutual discoveries, Maurey becomes pregnant. She decides to have an [[abortion]] in a distant hospital, and by accident, runs into her mother and the baseball coach who is also there with the same intent.\n\nAfter that Maurey moves in with Lydia and Sam since her father banished her from his house. Meanwhile, Hank Elkrunner, a [[Blackfoot]], falls for the feckless Lydia, while her dictatorial dad keeps tabs on them all from afar.\n\nIn the end, Maurey decides not to have an abortion and keeps the baby, a little girl named Shannon. After being threatened to be financially cut off unless she breaks up with Hank, and lets Sam go to Military School, Lydia decides to stay with Hank, and takes a job at the local diner. In addition, Hank sells his trailer and moves in with Sam and Lydia, along with Maurey and Shannon who decide to permanently move in. The film ends with Sam finishing the flashback for the story, with Shannon nearby.\n\nThroughout the movie, Sam has many dream fantasies that star [[Drew Barrymore]] as the subject of his fantasies.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Drew Barrymore]] as Fantasy Girl, the subject of Sam's numerous dream fantasies.
