It grossed $167 million worldwide against a $155 million budget, thus making it a [[Box-office bomb|commercial failure]].\n\nFour versions of the film exist, the initial theatrical cut and three home video [[director's cut]]s: the \"Director's Cut\" in 2005, the \"Final Cut\" in 2007 and the \"Ultimate Cut\" in 2013.

His relationship with his father, [[Philip II of Macedon]], is destroyed when Philip marries [[Attalus (general)|Attalus]]'s niece, [[Cleopatra Eurydice of Macedon|Eurydice]]. Alexander insults Philip after disowning Attalus as his [[kinship|kinsman]], which results in Alexander's banishment from Philip's palace.\n\nAfter Philip is [[Assassination|assassinated]], Alexander becomes King of Macedonia. Ptolemy mentions Alexander's punitive campaign in which he razes [[Thebes, Greece|Thebes]], also referring to the later burning of [[Persepolis]], then gives an overview of Alexander's west-Persian campaign, including his declaration as the son of [[Zeus]] by the [[Oracle]] of [[Amun]] at [[Siwa Oasis]], his great battle against the Persian Emperor [[Darius III of Persia|Darius III]] in the [[Battle of Gaugamela]], and his eight-year campaign across Asia.\n\nAlso seen are Alexander's private relationships with his childhood friend [[Hephaestion]], [[Bagoas (courtier)|Bagoas]], and later his wife, [[Roxana]]. Hephaestion compares Alexander to [[Achilles]], to which Alexander replies that Hephaestion must be his [[Patroclus]] (Achilles' lover). When Hephaestion mentions that Patroclus died first, Alexander pledges that, if Hephaestion should die first, he will follow him into the afterlife (as Achilles had done for Patroclus). Hephaestion shows extensive jealousy when he sees Alexander with Roxana, and deep sadness when he marries her, going so far as to attempt to keep her away from him after Alexander murders [[Cleitus the Black]] in India.\n\nAfter initial objection from his soldiers, Alexander convinces them to join him in his final and bloodiest battle, the [[Battle of Hydaspes]]. He is severely injured with an arrow but survives and is celebrated. Later on, Hephaestion succumbs to an unknown illness either by chance or perhaps poison, speculated in the film to be [[typhus]] carried with him from India. Alexander, full of grief and anger, distances himself from his wife, despite her pregnancy, believing that she has killed Hephaestion. [[Death of Alexander the Great|He dies]] less than three months after Hephaestion, in the same manner, keeping his promise that he would follow him. On his deathbed, Bagoas grieves as [[Diadochi|Alexander's generals]] begin to split up his kingdom and [[Wars of the Diadochi|fight over the ownership of his body]].\n\nThe story then returns to 285 BC, where Ptolemy admits to his scribe that he, along with all the other officers, had indeed poisoned Alexander just to spare themselves from any future conquests or consequences. However, he has it recorded that Alexander died due to illness compounding his overall weakened condition. He then goes on to end his memoirs with praise to Alexander.\n\nThe movie then ends with the note that Ptolemy's memoirs of Alexander were eventually burned, lost forever with the [[Library of Alexandria]].\n\n==Cast==\n{{colbegin|colwidth=40em}}\n* [[Colin Farrell]] as [[Alexander the Great|Alexander]]\n** Jessie Kamm as child Alexander\n** [[Connor Paolo]] as young Alexander\n* [[Angelina Jolie]] as [[Olympias|Queen Olympias]]\n* [[Val Kilmer]] as [[Philip II of Macedonia|King Philip II]]\n* [[Anthony Hopkins]] as old [[Ptolemy I Soter|Ptolemy]]\n** [[Elliot Cowan]] as adult Ptolemy\n** Robert Earley as young Ptolemy\n* [[Jared Leto]] as [[Hephaestion]]\n** Patrick Carroll as young Hephaestion\n* [[Rosario Dawson]] as [[Roxana]]\n* [[Christopher Plummer]] as [[Aristotle]]\n* [[David Bedella]] as scribe Cadmus\n* [[Fiona O'Shaughnessy]] as nurse\n* [[Brian Blessed]] as wrestling trainer\n* [[Gary Stretch]] as [[Cleitus the Black]]\n* [[John Kavanagh (actor)|John Kavanagh]] as [[Parmenion]]\n* [[Nick Dunning]] as [[Attalus (general)|Attalus]]\n* [[Marie Meyer]] as [[Cleopatra Eurydice of Macedon|Eurydice]]\n* [[Mick Lally]] as horse seller\n* [[Joseph Morgan (actor)|Joseph Morgan]] as [[Philotas]]\n* [[Ian Beattie]] as [[Antigonus I Monophthalmus|Antigonus]]\n* [[Jonathan Rhys Meyers]] as [[Cassander]]\n** Morgan Christopher Ferris as young Cassander\n* Denis Conway as [[Nearchus]]\n** Peter Williamson as young Nearchus\n* [[Neil Jackson]] as [[Perdiccas]]\n** Aleczander Gordon as young Perdiccas\n* Garrett Lombard as [[Leonnatus]]\n* [[Chris Aberdein]] as [[Polyperchon]]\n* [[Rory McCann]] as [[Craterus]]\n* [[Tim Pigott-Smith]] as omen reader\n* [[Raz Degan]] as [[Darius III|Darius]]\n* [[Erol Sander]] as Persian prince\n* St\u00e9phane Ferrara as [[Bessus]], Bactrian commander\n* [[Tadhg Murphy (actor)|Tadhg Murphy]] as dying soldier\n* [[Francisco Bosch]] as [[Bagoas (courtier)|Bagoas]]\n* [[Annelise Hesme]] as [[Stateira II|Stateira]]\n* [[Toby Kebbell]] as [[Pausanias of Orestis]]\n* [[Laird Macintosh]] as Greek officer\n* [[F\u00e9odor Atkine]] as [[Oxyartes|Roxana's father]]\n* [[Bin Bunluerit]] as [[King Porus]] of India\n* Jaran Ngramdee as Indian prince\n* [[Brian McGrath (actor)|Brian McGrath]] as doctor\n* [[Oliver Stone]] (''uncredited'') as Macedonian soldier at Zeus Statue\n{{colend}}\n\n==Production==\n{{Expand section|date=February 2013}}\nThe first mention of the film was in October 2001 by Initial Entertainment Group.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hive4media.com/news/html/theatrical_article.cfm?article_id=1977|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050504144759/http://www.hive4media.com/news/html/theatrical_article.cfm?article_id=1977|title=Scorsese, DiCaprio Make Great Team for 'Alexander'|website=[[Hive4media.com]]|archive-date=4 May 2005|date=24 October 2001|access-date=21 September 2019|via=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Locations===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2018}}\n*Library of [[Alexandria]]: [[Shepperton Studios, London]], England\n*[[Pella]]/Babylon/Indian palaces and myths cave: [[Pinewood Studios, London]], England\n* Alexandria (effect back plate): [[Malta]]\n* Temple of [[Athena|Pallas Athena]], [[Mieza, Macedonia|Mieza]] and [[Macedon]]ian horse market: [[Essaouira]], Morocco\n* Gaugamela: desert near [[Marrakech]], Morocco\n* Babylon gates: [[Marrakech]], Morocco\n* Bactrian fortress: [[Atlas Mountains|Lower Atlas Mountains]], Morocco\n*[[Hindu Kush]] (effect back plate): Ouarzazate, Morocco\n* Macedonian amphitheater: Morocco\n* Hyphasis: [[Mekong]], northeastern [[Ubon Ratchathani Province]], Thailand\n* Hydaspes: Central Botanical Garden, Amphoe Mueang, [[Saraburi Province]], Thailand\n\n==Controversies==\nA group of 25 Greek lawyers initially threatened to file a [[lawsuit]] against both Stone and the [[Warner Bros]] film studio for what they claimed was an inaccurate portrayal of history. \"We are not saying that we are against [[homosexuality|gays]],\" said Yannis Varnakos, \"but we are saying that the production company should make it clear to the audience that this film is pure fiction and not a true depiction of the life of Alexander\".

He goes into great detail explaining how he merged all the major aspects of the [[Battle of the Granicus]] and the [[Battle of Issus]] into the [[Battle of Gaugamela]], as well as heavily simplifying the [[Battle of Hydaspes]] into a straightforward clash, while merging the near-death of Alexander with the [[siege of Malli]]. In a taped discussion at the [[Oxford Union]], Oliver Stone stated regarding his presentation of the Battle of Gaugamela: \"I've been told by many historians that the battle is as accurate as they've ever seen in any movie, ever, to what they think happened at the battle\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBtvjsE4JQ|title=Oliver Stone &#124; Full Q&A &#124; Oxford Union|website=[[YouTube]]}}</ref>\n\nHowever, early-Greek-history [[ethnographer]]/analyst Angelos Chaniotis, of [[Princeton University|Princeton's]] [[Institute for Advanced Study]]\u2014in summarizing the first three versions of the film as \"a dramatisation, [rather than] a documentary\"\u2014nevertheless insists that, despite its imperfections, historians and history students \"have a lot to learn\" by \"studying and reflecting upon\" Stone's film.
