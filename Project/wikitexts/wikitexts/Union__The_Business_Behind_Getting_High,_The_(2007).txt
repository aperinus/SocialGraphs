Its theatrical run was limited to [[film festivals]].\n\n== Synopsis ==\nThe film explores the growth, sale and trafficking of [[cannabis]]. The documentary examines the underground market by interviewing growers, police officers, criminologists, psychologists, economists, doctors, politicians and pop culture icons, revealing how the trade is booming despite being a criminal enterprise. The history of cannabis and the reasons for its present prohibition are discussed, often comparing it to the [[Prohibition in the United States|prohibition of alcohol in the United States]] in the 1920s, suggesting that gang drug warfare and other negative aspects associated with cannabis are a result of prohibition, not the drug itself.\n\nThe gangs that grow and [[drug trafficking|traffic the drugs]] are likened to those that appeared in major US cities during Prohibition, with the intention of profiting from the sale of illegal alcohol. The film answers many questions about cannabis, including the purported health effects of cannabis use, the [[gateway drug theory]], and what could happen if cannabis was legalized. The film also discusses the medicinal value of the cannabis plant and what the pharmaceutical industry stands to lose from cannabis legalization.\n\n== Release and reception ==\n''The Union'' opened in 30 International Film Festivals beginning with the Winnipeg International Film Festival on June 8, 2007. Rotten Tomatoes movie critic, Kevin Carr, stated that \"problems with \u201cThe Union\u201d stem from the overtly biased nature of the production\".<ref>{{citation |url=http://www.7mpictures.com/inside/reviews/theuniondvd_review.htm |title=The Union |publisher=7M Pictures |work=Review |author=Kevin Carr |access-date=2012-10-09}}</ref><ref>{{citation |url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the-union-the-business-behind-getting-high/#!reviews=all |title=The Union: The Business Behind Getting High |publisher=Rotten Tomatoes |work=Review |access-date=2012-10-09}}</ref> Reviews from other critics were more favorable, including a 4 star rating from [[AMC (TV channel)|AMC]] film critic Pete Croatto who stated \"The Union is more like a fiercely intelligent personal essay.
