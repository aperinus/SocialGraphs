It is the tenth installment in the [[Friday the 13th (franchise)|''Friday the 13th'' franchise]], the first one since 1993's ''[[Jason Goes to Hell: The Final Friday]]''. In the film, Jason is [[Cryopreservation|cryogenically frozen]] for 445 years and awakens in 2455, after being found by a group of students, whom he subsequently stalks and kills one by one.\n\nWhile other films of the franchise approach Jason as a human serial killer or undead monster, this movie views him through a science-fiction lens (referring to his inability to die as a \"regenerative\" power that can be studied and perhaps replicated) and then has him transformed by future-technology into a [[cyborg]]. This cyborg incarnation has been called Jason X in tie-in media, but is also often referred to by fans as \"Uber Jason\", a nickname the art design team and production crew used and which appeared in later comic books ''Jason X Special'' and ''Friday the 13th: Jason vs. Jason X''.<ref>Fridaythe13thFranchise.com - [http://www.fridaythe13thfranchise.com/2015/04/original-uber-jason-concept-art-from.html \"Original Uber-Jason Concept Art from Jaxon X.\"]</ref><ref name=\":0\">ScreenRant - [https://screenrant.com/friday-the-13-the-jason-x-sequel-comic/ \"Friday the 13th: The Jason X Sequel Comics is Even Crazier than the Movie.\"]</ref><ref name=\":1\" /> When conceiving the film, Todd Farmer came up with the idea of sending Jason into space, suggesting to the studio that it was the only direction left for the series.<ref name=\"Bryan Cairns\">{{cite web|url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2002/04/23/an-interview-with-jason-x-writer-todd-farmer|title=An Interview with Jason X Writer Todd Farmer|author=Cairns|first=Bryan|website=[[IGN]]|access-date=April 7, 2020}}</ref> Kane Hodder called into the [[Howard Stern Show]] on May 1, 2002 and shared \"I was a little hesitant about (the plot) the first time I heard the story too.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.marksfriggin.com/news02/4-29.htm#wed|title=MarksFriggin.com - Stern Show Archives}}</ref>\n\n''Jason X'' was theatrically released in the U.S. on April 26, 2002.

After numerous failed attempts to kill Jason over the following two years, government scientist [[Rowan LaFontaine]] suggests putting him in [[Cryogenics|cryogenic]] stasis. Dr. Wimmer and Sergeant Marcus arrive with soldiers, hoping to further research Jason's ability to heal from lethal wounds, as they believe it involves rapid cellular regeneration that can be replicated. Jason breaks free of his restraints and kills the soldiers and Dr. Wimmer. Rowan lures him into a cryogenic pod and activates it, but he ruptures the pod with his [[machete]], stabbing her in the abdomen. Cryogenic fluid spills into the sealed room, freezing them both.\n\n455 years later, Earth has become too polluted to support life and humans have moved to a new planet, Earth II. On a field trip to Earth, Professor Brandon Lowe, his [[Android (robot)|android]] companion KM-14, intern Adrienne Thomas, and students Tsunaron, Janessa, Azrael, Kinsa, Waylander, and Stoney explore the abandoned Crystal Lake Research Facility, finding the frozen Jason and Rowan. They bring them aboard their spaceship, the ''Grendel'', and revive Rowan while leaving Jason in the morgue, believing him dead.\n\nAdrienne is ordered to dissect Jason's body but Rowan warns them of the danger, revealing Jason's nature and superhuman abilities. Lowe, who is in serious debt, calls his financial backer Dieter Perez on nearby space station ''Solaris''. Perez recognizes Jason's name and notes his body could interest a collector. While Stoney and Kinsa have sex, Jason awakens and attacks Adrienne, freezing her face with [[liquid nitrogen]] before smashing her head to pieces on a counter. Jason takes a machete-shaped surgical tool and kills Stoney in front of Kinsa. Sergeant Brodski leads a group of soldiers to attack Jason. Jason interrupts a projected holographic game, breaking Azrael's back and bashing in Dallas's skull. He tries to attack Crutch, but Brodski and his soldiers arrive. After Brodski splits up his team, Jason kills them one by one.\n\nLowe orders pilot Lou to dock at ''Solaris''. Jason kills Lou and the ship crashes through ''Solaris'', destroying it and killing everyone aboard. Jason breaks into the lab, reclaims his machete and decapitates Lowe. With the ''Grendel'' crippled, the survivors head for a shuttle while Tsunaron upgrades KM-14. After crew member Crutch is electrocuted by Jason, Kinsa panics and attempts to escape on her own, but forgets to release the shuttle's fuel line, causing it to crash into the ship and explode. Tsunaron reappears with an upgraded KM-14 who wields weapons and combat skills to stand a better chance against Jason. After having his right arm, left leg, right ribs, and part of his head blasted off by KM-14, his body is knocked into a [[Nanotechnology|nanite]]-equipped medical station. The survivors send a distress call, then set explosive charges to separate the ship's undamaged pontoon from the main section.\n\nThe medical station nanites rebuild Jason, who becomes a [[cyborg]]. With his new strength, Jason easily defeats KM-14 by punching her head off. As Tsunaron recovers her still-functioning head, Jason is stopped by Waylander, who sacrifices himself by setting off the charges while the others escape. Jason survives and punches a hole through the hull, causing Janessa to die in the [[Vacuum pump|vacuum]]. A power failure with the docking door forces Brodski to go outside in an [[Extravehicular activity|EVA]] suit to fix it.\n\nTo distract Jason, a [[Virtual reality|holographic simulation]] of Camp Crystal Lake is created with two virtual teenage girls. After killing them, Jason realizes the deception just as the door is fixed. Still in his EVA suit, Brodski confronts Jason so the rest can escape. As they leave, the pontoon explodes, propelling Jason at high speed towards the survivors; Brodski intercepts Jason's space flight and maneuvers them both toward Earth II's atmosphere, where they are both incinerated on [[atmospheric entry]]. Tsunaron, Rowan, and KM-14 escape as Tsunaron assures KM-14 she will have a new body.\n\nOn Earth II, a pair of teenagers are by a lake when they see what they believe is a [[Meteoroid|falling star]]. The teenagers go to investigate as Jason's charred mask sinks to the bottom of the lake.\n\n==Cast==\n{{main|List of Friday the 13th characters}}\n{{div col}}\n* [[Kane Hodder]] as [[Jason Voorhees|Jason Voorhees / Uber Jason]]\n* [[Lexa Doig]] as [[Rowan LaFontaine]]\n* [[Lisa Ryder]] as Kay-Em 14\n* [[Chuck Campbell]] as Tsunaron Peyton\n* [[Melyssa Ade]] as Janessa Zachary\n* [[Peter Mensah]] as Sergeant Elijah Brodski\n* Melody Johnson as Kirra \"Kinsa\" Cooper\n* Derwin Jordan as Waylander\n* Jonathan Potts as Professor Brandon Lowe\n* Phillip Williams as Trevor Crutchfield \"Crutch\"\n* [[Dov Tiefenbach]] as Azrael Benrubi\n* [[Kristi Angus]] as Adrienne Thomas\n* Dylan Bierk as Private Briggs\n* [[Amanda Brugel]] as Private Geko\n* [[Yani Gellman]] as Stoney\n* [[Todd Farmer]] as Private Dallas\n* [[Thomas Seniuk]] as Private Sven\n* [[Steve Lucescu]] as Private Condor\n* [[David Cronenberg]] as Dr. Aloysius Wimmer\n* [[Robert A.

The comic reveals that a scientist named Kristen intercepted the Grendel's communications and became interested in learning the secrets of Jason's regenerative abilities so she could save her lover Neil as well as the human race, which is still an endangered species barely surviving. To trick the Grendel survivors into bringing Jason to her, she faked the rescue transmission and hacked into their system, using their own holographic technology to convince them they were escaping to Earth II. This resulted in the deaths of all aboard the ''Grendel''. Aboard her own ship, Kristen then attempts to study Jason X, referring to him as \"Uber-Jason.\" Jason X's new cyborg abilities allow him to take control of Kristen's technology. When she attempts to pass on his regenerative abilities to Neil, the nanites in Jason X's blood corrupt's the man's mind and he stabs her. Kristen's ship then comes across a hedonistic pleasure spaceship called ''Fun Club''. After docking, Jason boards the ''Fun Club'' and begins killing the hedonists, ending the story.\n\nIn 2006, Avatar Press released a licensed two-issue comic book mini-series called ''Friday the 13th: Jason vs. Jason X'', written and illustrated by Mike Wolfer, with Andrew Dalhouse as colorist. Advertised as a fight between Jason and \"Uber-Jason,\" the mini-series is a continuation of the comic ''Jason X Special.'' While Jason X is aboard the ''Fun Club,'' the story returns to the ''Grendel'' drifting in space where a malfunctioning medical station attempts to revive the half of Jason's head that KM-14 shot off in the movie. Since the nanites cannot revive only \"13%\" of Jason's body mass into a full living being, it collects the remains of other dead bodies aboard the ship and uses them as raw material. As a result, another version of Jason is resurrected, one who resembles the traditional version. When scavengers board the ''Grendel,'' the traditional Jason attacks and then uses their shuttle to reach the nearest ship, the ''Fun Club'' pleasure cruiser. There, the revived Jason finds the cyborg Jason X and the two fight while also killing all passengers they come across. Each killer is revealed to have only part of the mind and memory of the original Jason. The battle ends when Jason X defeats and rips out the brain matter of the traditional Jason, merging it with his own and restoring his full memories and personality. The ship crashes on Earth II and Jason X leaves the wreckage to explore a nearby forest.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===Video games===\nAfter the 2017 release of ''[[Friday the 13th: The Game]]'', it was teased that the cyborg Jason X incarnation would be playable in the game the following year. However, Victor Miller, screenwriter of the original film ''[[Friday the 13th (1980 film)|Friday the 13th]]'', exercised his legal creative rights and served a lawsuit regarding residual profits he felt he was owed by the film franchise and tie-in media that resulted from the original movie.
