The film stars [[Ben Affleck]] as [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Matt Murdock]], a blind lawyer who fights for justice in the courtroom and on the streets of New York as the masked [[vigilante]] Daredevil. [[Jennifer Garner]] plays his [[Romantic interest|love interest]] [[Elektra (comics)|Elektra Natchios]]; [[Colin Farrell]] plays the merciless assassin [[Bullseye (character)|Bullseye]]; [[David L. Keith|David Keith]] plays Jack \"The Devil\" Murdock, a washed up fighter and Matt's father; and [[Michael Clarke Duncan]] plays [[Kingpin (character)|Wilson Fisk]], the crime lord also known as the Kingpin.\n\nThe film began development in 1997 at [[20th Century Fox]] and [[Columbia Pictures]], before [[Regency Enterprises|New Regency]] acquired the rights in 2000. Johnson shot the film primarily in [[Downtown Los Angeles]] despite the [[Hell's Kitchen, Manhattan]] setting of the film and comics. [[Rhythm and Hues Studios]] were hired to handle the film's [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]]. [[Graeme Revell]] composed the ''Daredevil'' score, which was released on [[Compact Disc|CD]] in March 2003, whereas the various artists' soundtrack album, ''[[Daredevil: The Album]]'', was released in February.\n\n''Daredevil'' was released on February 14, 2003. It received generally mixed reviews from critics, with praise aimed at the action sequences, acting performances, soundtrack, storyline, visual style and stunts, while criticism was aimed at Affleck's performance and its perceived lack of ambition.  Nevertheless, the film became the second-biggest February release to that time and went on to a worldwide total gross of $179.2 million against a production budget of $78 million.\n\nIn 2004, an R-rated [[director's cut]] of ''Daredevil'' was released, reincorporating approximately 30 minutes of the film, and reviews were more positive than for the theatrical version. A [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] film, ''[[Elektra (2005 film)|Elektra]]'', was released in 2005 to critical and commercial failure. Daredevil was rebooted as a [[Daredevil (TV series)|Netflix television series]] from 2015\u20132018.\n\n==Plot==\n<!--per [[WP:FILMPLOT]], plot are between 400 and 700 words-->\nAs a child, young [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Matt Murdock]] is accidentally blinded by toxic chemicals shortly after witnessing his father\u2014washed-up prizefighter Jack \"The Devil\" Murdock\u2014extorting money for local mobster Fallon. Despite losing his sight, Matt's remaining senses are dramatically enhanced, giving him superhuman agility and [[sonar]]-like hearing. Feeling responsible for his son's accident, Jack is inspired to give up his life of crime and recommit to his boxing career, leading to a dramatic comeback. Later, after Fallon reveals that he enabled Jack's comeback by bribing his previous opponents to let him win, he attempts to bribe Jack to throw his next match, and has him murdered when he refuses.\n\nYears later, an adult Matt works as an attorney in [[Hell's Kitchen, Manhattan|Hell's Kitchen]] with his friend [[Foggy Nelson|Franklin \"Foggy\" Nelson]], providing legal representation ''[[pro bono]]'' to clients whom he believes are [[Actual innocence|actually innocent]]. By night, Matt fights crime as the costumed vigilante \"Daredevil\". [[Ben Urich]], a ''[[New York Post]]'' reporter who chronicles Daredevil's exploits, attracts attention for a series of articles on \"[[Kingpin (character)|The Kingpin]]\", a shadowy underworld figure who allegedly controls all of New York's organized crime. Unbeknownst to Urich, the Kingpin is actually Wilson Fisk, a brutal mobster who poses as a legitimate businessman.\n\nMatt falls in love with [[Elektra (character)|Elektra Natchios]], a Greek-American woman skilled in martial arts, unaware that she's the daughter of Fisk's lieutenant Nikolas Natchios. Later, when Natchios attempts to end his relationship with Fisk, Fisk hires [[Bullseye (character)|Bullseye]]\u2014a hitman with preternatural aim\u2014to kill him. When Daredevil unsuccessfully attempts to save Natchios from assassination, Bullseye manages to frame Daredevil for his murder by stealing Daredevil's distinctive baton and impaling Natchios with it. Afterward, Urich deduces that Matt is Daredevil after realizing that he disguises his baton as a [[white cane]].\n\nBelieving Daredevil to be responsible for her father's murder, Elektra attempts to avenge her father by killing him. Meanwhile, Fisk assigns Bullseye to kill Elektra. Elektra tracks Daredevil down and challenges him to a fight, and incapacitates him by stabbing him through the shoulder. Daredevil protests that he didn't kill her father, but Elektra does not believe him until she forcibly unmasks him and realizes that he's Matt. Moments later, when Bullseye tracks Elektra down, Matt is forced to watch helplessly as Bullseye kills her.\n\nWounded, Matt takes refuge in a church, but is ambushed by Bullseye, who exploits his weakness to loud sound. When police swarm the church, Matt gains the upper hand and throws Bullseye from the bell tower after an NYPD sniper shoots him through both hands, depriving him of his powerful aim. During the fight, Bullseye reveals that he was hired by the Kingpin, and that the Kingpin is Fisk.\n\nDetermined to avenge Elektra, Matt ambushes Fisk in his office. In the ensuing fight, he is nearly overcome by Fisk's brute strength, but wins by taking advantage of his sonar hearing, which allows him to see Fisk after he's drenched by rain from a broken window. In the course of their confrontation, Fisk reveals that he was the hitman who killed Matt's father on Fallon's orders, making him responsible for the deaths of the two people whom Matt loved most. As the police arrive to arrest Fisk, he threatens to reveal Daredevil's identity to the world, but Matt points out that no one will ever believe that Daredevil is a blind man.\n\nSome time after Elektra's death, Matt visits the spot where the two of them first kissed, and unexpectedly finds Elektra's necklace\u2014which has her name engraved upon it in braille, hinting that [[Elektra (2005 film)|Elektra might still be alive]].\n\nUrich prepares to publish an article revealing Daredevil's identity, but chooses not to publish it at the last minute, coming to believe that Daredevil's efforts have made the city better. Elsewhere, Bullseye wakes up at a hospital, and kills a fly with a syringe needle, implying he has not lost his perfect aim yet.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Ben Affleck]] as [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Matt Murdock / Daredevil]]: <br />An [[Lawyer|attorney-at-law]] who was [[blindness|blinded]] as a youth in an accident with bio-waste that drastically heightened his remaining senses and gave him a \"sonar-sense\", which allowed him to perceive his surroundings, and makes a silent promise with his father to \"stick up for the long shots\". His father is killed not long after and at that moment, he vows to seek justice. At night, he becomes a devil-modeled vigilante who takes justice into his hands. Affleck was cast in October 2001. [[Vin Diesel]] was considered to portray Daredevil before him, but he opted to take a role in [[The Fast and the Furious (2001 film)|another film]].<ref>{{cite news|first=Tim |last=Swanson |date=October 3, 2001 |url=https://www.variety.com/article/VR1117853634 |title=Affleck homes in on ''Daredevil'' role |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |access-date=February 21, 2008| archive-date= February 22, 2015 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150222220249/http://variety.com/2001/film/news/affleck-homes-in-on-daredevil-role-1117853634/| url-status=live}}</ref> In a February 2011 interview, [[Guy Pearce]] said that he was offered the role but turned it down, stating that \"comic-strip stuff isn't really my cup of tea, really.\"<ref>{{cite news |title=Guy Pearce on Batman, Being Offered Daredevil, and Avoiding Terrible Scripts |first= Gwynne |last=Watkins |url=https://nymag.com/daily/entertainment/2011/02/guy_pearce_on_getting_offered.html |newspaper=[[New York (magazine)|New York]] |date= February 25, 2011 |access-date=March 6, 2011 | archive-date= February 22, 2015 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150222213446/http://www.vulture.com/2011/02/guy_pearce_on_getting_offered.html | url-status=live}}</ref> [[Matt Damon]] also revealed that he was offered the role.

Joe Quesada's artistic take in ''[[Guardian Devil]]'' (''Daredevil'' vol. 2, #1\u2013#8) was an influence on the film, with Johnson noting that they would \"literally take out a scene from the comic book that Joe did [...] Here's Daredevil on the cross, you know, it's that scene from 'Guardian Devil'.
