Based on the 2009 [[Maersk Alabama hijacking|''Maersk Alabama'' hijacking]], the film tells the story of the eponymous [[Richard Phillips (merchant mariner)|Captain Richard Phillips]], an American [[merchant mariner]] who was taken hostage by [[Piracy off the coast of Somalia|Somali pirates]]. It stars [[Tom Hanks]] as Phillips, alongside [[Barkhad Abdi]] as pirate leader [[Abduwali Muse]].\n\nThe screenplay by [[Billy Ray (screenwriter)|Billy Ray]] is based on Phillips's 2010 book ''[[A Captain's Duty|A Captain's Duty: Somali Pirates, Navy SEALs, and Dangerous Days at Sea]]'', which Phillips co-wrote with [[Stephan Talty]]. [[Scott Rudin]], [[Dana Brunetti]] and [[Michael De Luca]] served as producers on the project. It premiered at the [[2013 New York Film Festival]],<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-23501131 |title=Paul Greengrass film to open New York Film Festival |work=BBC News |date=August 1, 2013 |access-date=August 23, 2013}}</ref> and was theatrically released on October 11, 2013. The film emerged as a critical and commercial success, receiving positive reviews from critics and grossing $220 million against a budget of $55 million.

Wary of pirate activity off the coast of the [[Horn of Africa]], he and First Officer [[Shane Murphy (captain)|Shane Murphy]] order strict security precautions on the vessel and carry out a practice drill. During the drill, the captain notices that the vessel is being followed by Somali pirates in two [[skiff]]s, and Phillips calls for help. Knowing that the pirates are listening to radio traffic, he pretends to call a warship, requesting immediate air support. One skiff turns around in response, and the other &ndash; crewed by four heavily armed pirates led by [[Abduwali Muse]] &ndash; loses engine power trying to steer through ''Maersk Alabama''{{'}}s wake.\n\nThe next day, Muse's skiff, now fitted with two outboard engines, returns with the same four pirates aboard. Despite the valiant efforts of Phillips and his crew, the pirates secure their ladder to the ship. As they board, Phillips tells the crew to hide in the engine room, just before the pirates storm the bridge and hold Phillips and the other crew members at gunpoint. Phillips offers Muse the $30,000 in the ship's safe, but Muse's orders are to ransom the ship and crew in exchange for millions of dollars of insurance money from the shipping company. While they search the ship, Shane sees that the youngest pirate Bilal does not have sandals and tells the crew to line the engine room hallway with broken glass. Chief Engineer Mike Perry deactivates the power to the ship, plunging the lower decks into darkness. Bilal cuts his feet when they reach the engine room, and Muse continues to search alone. The crew members ambush Muse, holding him at knifepoint, and arrange to release him and the other pirates into a [[Lifeboat (shipboard)|lifeboat]]. However, Muse's right-hand man Nour Najee refuses to board the lifeboat with Muse unless Phillips goes with them. Once all are on the lifeboat, Najee attacks Phillips, forcing him into the vessel before launching the boat with all five of them on board.\n\nAs the lifeboat heads for Somalia, tensions flare between the pirates as they run low on the plant-based amphetamine [[khat]] that they have been eating, and they lose contact with their [[mother ship]]. Najee becomes agitated and begins to question Muse\u2019s leadership when they are intercepted by the [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] [[destroyer]] {{USS|Bainbridge|DDG-96|6}}. ''Bainbridge''{{'}}s captain [[Frank Castellano]] is ordered to prevent the pirates from reaching the Somali coast by any means. Even when additional ships arrive, Muse asserts that he has come too far and will not surrender. The negotiators are unable to change his mind, and a team from [[DEVGRU]] parachutes in to intervene, while Phillips attempts to escape from the lifeboat before being quickly recaptured and repeatedly beaten by Najee.\n\nWhile three DEVGRU marksmen get into positions, Castellano and DEVGRU continue to try to find a peaceful solution, eventually taking the lifeboat under tow. Muse agrees to board ''Bainbridge'', where he is told that his clan elders are arriving to negotiate Phillips's ransom. In the lifeboat, Phillips prepares a goodbye letter to his wife in case he is killed, while Najee decides to take full control. Najee spots Phillips writing the letter and snatches it. Phillips retaliates by beating Najee until Bilal subdues Phillips by striking him in the back with his AK-47. The pirates tie up and blindfold Phillips and Najee beats Phillips further and berates Bilal and Elmi for their protests, even stating that they've been tricked by the Navy as the elders didn't come to negotiate. As Najee prepares to shoot Phillips, ''Bainbridge''{{'}}s crew stops the tow, causing Elmi, Bilal, and Najee to lose balance. This gives the marksmen three clear shots, by which they simultaneously kill all three pirates. Muse is arrested and taken into custody for piracy. Phillips is rescued from the lifeboat and his injuries are treated. Although in shock and disoriented, he thanks the rescue team for saving his life.\n\n==Cast==\n{{multiple image\n| align        =\n| direction    = horizontal\n| footer       = [[Tom Hanks]] (left) portrayed [[Richard Phillips (merchant mariner)|Richard Phillips]] (right).\n| footer_align = center\n| image1       = Tom Hanks 2014.jpg\n| width1       = 168\n| image2       = RichardPhillips.jpg\n| width2       = 125\n}}\n\n=== ''Maersk Alabama'' crew and allies ===\n\n* [[Tom Hanks]] as [[Richard Phillips (merchant mariner)|Richard \"Rich\" Phillips]] / \"Irish\", [[Sea captain|Captain]]\n* [[Catherine Keener]] as Andrea Phillips, Phillips's wife\n* [[Michael Chernus]] as Shane Murphy, [[Chief mate|first officer]]\n* [[David Warshofsky]] as Mike Perry, [[chief engineer]]\n* [[Corey Johnson (actor)|Corey Johnson]] as Ken Quinn, [[helmsman]]\n* [[Chris Mulkey]] as John Cronan, senior crew member\n* [[Mark Holden (actor)|Mark Holden]] as William Rios, boatswain\n* [[Angus MacInnes]] as Ian Waller, crew member\n* [[Louis Mahoney]] as Ethan Stoll, crew member\n* [[Vincenzo Nicoli]] as Andrew, crew member\n* [[Maria Dizzia]] as Allison McColl\n* [[John Magaro]] as Dan Phillips\n* Gigi Raines as Mariah Phillips\n* [[Riann Steele]] as Bernetti, US Maritime\n\n=== Pirates and allies ===\n\n* [[Barkhad Abdi]] as [[Abduwali Muse]], pirate leader\n* Barkhad Abdirahman as Adan Bilal\n* [[Faysal Ahmed]] as Nour Najee\n* Mahat M.
