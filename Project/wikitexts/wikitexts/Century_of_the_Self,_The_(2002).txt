The documentary explores the various ways that governments, global organizations and corporations have used Freud's theories. Freud and his nephew [[Edward Bernays]], who was the first to use psychological techniques in [[public relations]], are discussed in part one. His daughter [[Anna Freud]], a pioneer of child psychology, is mentioned in part two. [[Wilhelm Reich]], an opponent of Freud's theories, is discussed in part three.\n\n{{Quote box | quote = To many in politics and business, the triumph of the self is the ultimate expression of democracy, where power has finally moved to the people. Certainly, the people may feel they are in charge, but are they really? ''The Century of the Self'' tells the untold and sometimes controversial story of the growth of the mass-consumer society. How was the all-consuming self created, by whom, and in whose interests? | source = BBC publicity.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/bbcfour/documentaries/features/century_of_the_self.shtml|title=BBC Four Documentaries - The Century of the Self |work=[[BBC Online]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514032526/http://www.bbc.co.uk/bbcfour/documentaries/features/century_of_the_self.shtml|archivedate=14 May 2011 }}</ref> | width = 20% | align = left}}\n\nAlong these lines, ''The Century of the Self'' asks deeper questions about the roots and methods of [[consumerism]] and [[commodification]] and their implications. It also questions the modern way people see themselves, the attitudes to [[fashion]], and [[superficiality]].\n\nThe business and political worlds use psychological techniques to read, create and fulfill the desires of the public, and to make their products and speeches as pleasing as possible to consumers and voters. Curtis questions the intentions and origins of this relatively new approach to engaging the public.\n\nWhere once the political process was about engaging people's rational, conscious minds, as well as facilitating their needs as a group, [[Stuart Ewen]], a historian of public relations, argues that politicians now appeal to [[Instinct|primitive impulses]] that have little bearing on issues outside the narrow self-interests of a consumer society.\n\nThe words of Paul Mazur, a leading [[Wall Street]] banker working for [[Lehman Brothers]] in 1927, are cited: \"We must shift America from a needs- to a desires-culture. People must be trained to desire, to want new things, even before the old have been entirely consumed. [...] Man's desires must overshadow his needs.\"<ref>Note: the quote is from a 1927 article by Mazur in the ''[[Harvard Business Review]]''.</ref>\n\nIn part four the main subjects are [[Philip Gould]], a political strategist, and [[Matthew Freud]], a PR consultant and the great-grandson of Sigmund Freud. In the 1990s, they were instrumental to bringing the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] in the US and [[New Labour]] in the United Kingdom back into power through use of the [[focus group]], originally invented by psychoanalysts employed by US corporations to allow consumers to express their feelings and needs, just as patients do in psychotherapy.\n\nCurtis ends by saying that, \"Although we feel we are free, in reality, we\u2014like the politicians\u2014have become the slaves of our own desires,\" and compares Britain and America to 'Democracity', an exhibit at the [[1939 New York World's Fair]] created by Edward Bernays.\n\n==Contributors==\n{{Columns-list|colwidth=20em|\n* [[wmde:Alfred Pritz|Dr Alfred Pritz]], President, [[World Council for Psychotherapy]]\n* Countess Erzie K\u00e1rolyi\n* Edward Bernays (interviewed 1991)\n* Pat Jackson, [[Public relations|PR Adviser]] and colleague of Edward Bernays\n* Peter Strauss, employee of Edward Bernays 1948\u201352\n* Peter Solomon, investment banker, Lehman Brothers\n* Stuart Ewen, historian of public relations\n* [[wmde:Ernst Federn|Dr Ernst Federn]], Viennese psychoanalyst\n* Anne Bernays, daughter of Edward Bernays\n* [[George Gallup Jr.]], pollster\n* Marcel Faust, resident of Vienna, 1930s\n* Prof. [[Martin S.
