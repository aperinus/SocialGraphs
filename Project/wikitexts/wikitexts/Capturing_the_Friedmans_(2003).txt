During his research, Jarecki learned that David Friedman's brother, Jesse,<ref>{{cite web |title=Jesse Friedman's Website |url=https://www.freejesse.net |website=freejesse.net |access-date=22 January 2022}}</ref> and his father, Arnold, had pleaded guilty to [[child sexual abuse]], and the family had an archive of home movies. Jarecki interviewed some of the children involved and ended up making a film focusing on the Friedmans.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Review of Capturing the Friedmans|url=http://www.bmj.com/content/328/7444/901.short |last=Byrne|first=Peter|journal=[[BMJ]]|date=2003-05-20|volume=328 |issue=7444 |page=901 |doi=10.1136/bmj.328.7444.901 |s2cid=56946426 |access-date=2013-10-25}}</ref>\n\n==Synopsis==\nThe investigation into Arnold Friedman's life started in 1984, when the U.S. Postal Service intercepted a magazine of [[child pornography]] sent to him from the [[Netherlands]]. In 1987, investigators searched his home in [[Great Neck, New York]], and found a collection of child pornography. Upon learning that Arnold taught computer classes for preteen boys in his home, authorities interviewed the students, some of whom alleged they had been subjected to physical and sexual abuse at the hands of Arnold and his youngest son, Jesse, a young adult who assisted Arnold with the classes. The two men were arrested and accused of committing hundreds of crimes, throwing the community into turmoil. They were eventually able to get out on [[bail]] and returned home to prepare for court, hanging their hopes for [[acquittal]] on the lack of [[physical evidence]] against them and reports of the coercive tactics and leading questions that had been used to question the students.\n\nAround this time, David, Arnold's eldest son, got a [[camcorder]], and he recorded hours of home videos during this period. The videos were not made with the intention of showing them to the public, but the film incorporates some of this footage, which consists of family dinners, conversations, and arguments. While Arnold's three sons (Seth, the middle son, chose to not participate in the documentary) believed Arnold and Jesse were innocent, Elaine, Arnold's wife and the mother of the boys, was unsure of her husband's innocence, and she encouraged Arnold to confess, hoping that would somehow help Jesse's case. Arnold did [[guilty plea|plead guilty]] to multiple charges of [[sodomy]] and [[sexual abuse]] and was sentenced to prison. Jesse later also pleaded guilty; his charges were not reduced after his father's plea, but he said his father had molested him as a child to try to get a [[Mitigating factor|less severe sentence]] (Jesse has since stated that this was just a legal ploy).\n\nAfter their pleas, both Arnold and Jesse said that no abuse had taken place during the computer classes, but they felt, given the media coverage of the case and the climate in Great Neck at the time, they would have been convicted and given harsher sentences if they had gone to trial. However, in a document Arnold wrote while under [[house arrest]] after he was bailed out of jail, he did claim that, when he was 13, he sexually abused his younger brother, Howard, who was eight years old at the time (Howard is interviewed in the film and says he does not remember being abused by his brother), and admitted to, as an adult, molesting two boys who were not his students (Jesse's lawyer, Peter Panaro, who visited Arnold in a Wisconsin [[federal prison]], is interviewed in the film and says Arnold admitted this to him as well). Jesse, in a statement subsequent to the film, said his father also told him and his brothers that he sexually abused Howard.<ref>\"Presentation by Jesse Friedman, May 17, 2012\", http://www.freejesse.net/case-story, consulted 10-20-2014.</ref>\n\nArnold Friedman died in prison in 1995 after taking an overdose of [[antidepressants]], leaving a $250,000 [[life insurance]] benefit to Jesse. Jesse Friedman was released from New York's [[Clinton Correctional Facility]] in 2001 after serving 13 years of his sentence. As of 2013, he was running an online book-selling business.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/16/nyregion/reinvestigating-the-friedmans.html |title=Reinvestigating the Friedmans - The New York Times |work=The New York Times |date=June 15, 2013 |access-date=2019-04-05|last1=Applebome |first1=Peter }}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n''Capturing the Friedmans'' won the \"Grand Jury Prize: Documentary\" at the [[2003 Sundance Film Festival]]<ref name=\"ebert\"/> and received predominantly positive reviews.

Both Galasso and Boklan claim the film excluded evidence that points to Jesse's guilt, such as his interview with [[Geraldo Rivera]] and the existence of Ross Goldstein, the third defendant, who served time in prison after pleading guilty to charges of child molestation and even named two additional [[co-conspirator]]s, though they remained unindicted. (Goldstein is not named in the film, but it is said in one of the DVD extras that he declined to be interviewed. One of the unindicted co-conspirators claims in the same section that he and the fifth man were falsely accused by Goldstein.) During the Tribeca Q&A, Jesse's lawyer at the time of the case, Peter Panaro, said he advised Jesse not to appear on Rivera's talk show (Panaro was also present on the show), and even had Jesse sign an [[affidavit]] saying he was doing so against legal advice.<ref>CONVICTION INTEGRITY REVIEW: PEOPLE V.
