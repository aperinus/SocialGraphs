It was the first top-billed starring role for [[Samuel L. Jackson]], who plays a Los Angeles teacher caught with [[gang]] trouble in an urban high school. The film's name comes from the [[California Penal Code]] [[187 (slang)|Section 187]], which defines murder.\n\nThe original screenplay was written in 1995 by Scott Yagemann, a Los Angeles area high school substitute teacher for seven years. He wrote the screenplay after an incident when a violent transfer student had threatened to kill him and his family. Yagemann reported the threat to the authorities and the student was arrested. About a week later, he was called by the district attorney to testify against the student in a court of law, where the student was being prosecuted for stabbing a teacher's aide a year before. This annoyed Yagemann, who had not been told about it beforehand, and led to him writing the screenplay. He claimed that 90% of the film's material is based on incidents that had happened to him and other teachers in real life.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1997/aug/04/entertainment/ca-19253|title=90% of '187' Is Based on Schoolteachers' Reality|last=Yagemann|first=Scott|date=1997-08-04|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|access-date=2018-09-11|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161104071416/http://articles.latimes.com/1997/aug/04/entertainment/ca-19253|archive-date=November 4, 2016}}</ref><ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1997-07-30/lifestyle/9707290263_1_film-teachers-safety|title=Screenwriter: '187' Brutal - And All Too Real|last=Weeks|first=Janet|date=1997-07-30|work=[[Sun-Sentinel]]|access-date=2018-09-11|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180912022332/http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1997-07-30/lifestyle/9707290263_1_film-teachers-safety|archive-date=September 12, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nTrevor Garfield is a high school science teacher at Roosevelt Whitney High School, a high school in the [[Bedford\u2013Stuyvesant, Brooklyn|Bedford-Stuyvesant]] neighborhood of [[Brooklyn, New York|Brooklyn]]. Dennis Broadway, a [[gangster]] student to whom he had given a failing grade threatens to murder him, writing the number 187 (the California police code for homicide) on every page in a textbook.\n\nGarfield knows that this is a warning and tries to report his concerns to the administration. Garfield realises that Dennis wants to transfer back to his old school but in order to do so he needs to have good grades. The administration ignore Garfield's warning, and eventually Dennis ambushes Garfield in the school hallway, stabbing him in the back and side abdominal area multiple times with a [[Shiv (weapon)|shiv]].\n\nGarfield survives, though badly wounded, and is shown resuming his teaching career as a [[substitute teacher]] fifteen months later. He is relocated to John Quincy Adams High School in the [[San Fernando Valley]] area of [[Los Angeles]], but unfortunately he is assigned to another class of unruly students, including a [[Chicano]] [[Graffiti|tag crew]] by the name of \"Kappin' Off Suckers\" (K.O.S.). Their leader, Benito \"Benny\" Chac\u00f3n, a felon attending high school as a condition of [[probation]], makes it clear to Garfield that there will be no mutual respect.\n\nTension mounts when a fellow teacher, Ellen Henry confides that Benny has also threatened her life, an action against which the administration of the school refuses to take action as they fear the threat of legal action. After Benny murders a rival [[Graffiti#Tagging|tagger]] in cold blood, he  disappears, and Benny's unstable tag partner, C\u00e9sar Sanchez takes over as leader. C\u00e9sar embarks on a campaign of intimidation against Garfield which is started by the theft of Garfield's watch (which is a family heirloom). Garfield reports this to the principal who backs away taking any action in case C\u00e9sar were to sue the school for defamation.\n\nEllen and Garfield develop a close friendship that approaches the beginnings of a relationship, but is stymied by Garfield's destabilizing behavior and his confrontational approach to dealing with the K.O.S.. Meanwhile, alcoholic dispirited teacher Dave Childress starts to look into Garfield's past and learns of his earlier assault, but rather than report Garfield, he informs him of his admiration while showing him the pistol he carries in the school for defense.\n\nC\u00e9sar amps up the conflict between Garfield and the K.O.S. by killing Jack, Ellen's dog. Later after spraying cartoon graffiti depicting a dead dog, C\u00e9sar is shot with a syringe filled with morphine attached to the end of an arrow. He passes out, and wakes up to find one of his fingers removed. Upon finding the finger, C\u00e9sar finds the letters \"R U DUN\" (\"are you done?\") tattooed as a warning.\n\nLater Garfield witnesses Rita Mart\u00ednez, a student he is tutoring, facing abuse from both the K.O.S. and Childress. Rita later drops out of school. Garfield tries to intervene and approaches the school administration but is met with bureaucracy and is prevented from intervening. Later Benny's dead body is discovered in the [[Los Angeles River]], apparently of a drug overdose. However, it is revealed that Garfield took matters into his own hands, killing Benny and severing C\u00e9sar's finger. Ellen uncovers Garfield's spiral into violence and being unable to understand his ferocity, she leaves him.\n\nC\u00e9sar and the K.O.S. believe Garfield to be responsible for the murder of Benny and plan to retaliate in kind. C\u00e9sar, inspired by the film ''[[The Deer Hunter]]'' traps Garfield at his home, and (together with his gang) they force Garfield into a contest of [[Russian roulette]] with C\u00e9sar. C\u00e9sar, in a machismo mode, loads the revolver with two bullets. The gang are shocked at how Garfield doesn't beg for his life, but participates without flinching, and even openly confesses to killing Benny as well as cutting off C\u00e9sar's finger. After each round, Garfield talks about the lost-cause lifestyle C\u00e9sar has led. Garfield, on the penultimate round, takes his turn and survives; instead of handing the weapon to C\u00e9sar, Garfield takes the next turn and the weapon goes off, killing Garfield instantly. Driven by his sense of honor and ignoring the protests of his horrified friends, C\u00e9sar insists on taking his rightful turn and ends up killing himself. Stevie Littleton leaves the house, disillusioned with the K.O.S. life and distraught at the senseless loss of both lives.\n\nOn graduation day, Rita is shown to have completed her studies and graduated along with the now former K.O.S. member Stevie. Rita offers a tribute to Garfield by reading an essay about him. The essay incorporates the theme of the [[pyrrhic victory]] and Ellen leaves the school.\n\nThe closing narration cites a 1994 [[MetLife]]-[[Louis Harris]] Survey stating one in nine teachers has been attacked in school and 95 percent of those attacks were committed by students, as well as the movie being written by a teacher.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref>{{Cite book|title=Metropolitan Life Survey of the American Teacher, 1994; Violence in America's Public Schools: The Family Perspective|publisher=[[MetLife]]|year=1994|oclc=31757139}}</ref>\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Samuel L.
