Gordon]] and [[Kumail Nanjiani]]. It stars Nanjiani, [[Zoe Kazan]], [[Holly Hunter]], [[Ray Romano]], [[Adeel Akhtar]], and [[Anupam Kher]]. The film is inspired by the relationship between Nanjiani and Gordon, and follows an interethnic couple who must deal with cultural differences after Emily (Kazan) becomes ill.\n\nThe film had its world premiere at the [[Sundance Film Festival]] on January 20, 2017. It began a limited theatrical release on June 23, 2017, by [[Amazon Studios]] and [[Lionsgate Films|Lionsgate]], before going wide on July 14, 2017. One of the most acclaimed films of 2017, it was chosen by [[American Film Institute]] as one of the top 10 films of the year and was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.afi.com/afiawards/AFI-Awards-2017.aspx|title=AFI Awards 2017|website=[[American Film Institute|AFI]]|access-date=December 8, 2017}}</ref> With a budget of $5 million, it grossed $56 million worldwide, becoming one of the highest-grossing [[independent film]]s of 2017.\n\n== Plot ==\n<!-- WP:FILMPLOT recommends the plot summary to be between 400-700 words. -->\nKumail, an [[Uber]] driver in [[Chicago]], is a struggling [[stand-up comedian]] with a [[one-man show]] about his [[Pakistani American]] background. His immigrant parents want him to take the [[LSAT]] and continuously set him up with young single Pakistani women, expecting that he will follow their example of an [[arranged marriage]], but he is uninterested.\n\nAfter a show, Kumail has a [[one-night stand]] with Emily, a [[White Americans|white]] psychology student, and they begin an unexpected relationship. Kumail does not tell his family, fearful they will disown him. After five months, Emily finds photos of the young women Kumail's parents have set him up with. When he tells her he does not know if they have a future, she breaks up with him.\n\nKumail gets a call in the middle of the night from Emily's friend who tells him that Emily has been hospitalized; she has a serious lung infection and must be immediately placed in an [[induced coma]]. Pretending he\u2019s her husband, he signs the permission form for her to be put into a coma and then calls her parents, Beth and Terry. Aware of their daughter's messy breakup with Kumail, they tell him he is not needed, but Kumail stays and the three become closer as they deal with Emily's illness. Beth and Terry attend one of Kumail's stand-up gigs, during which a racist audience member heckles Kumail, causing Beth to defend him.\n\nSurgery is ineffective and the infection spreads to Emily's kidneys. Beth wants to transfer Emily to a different hospital, but Kumail and Terry disagree. Beth and Terry argue, and Terry stays at Kumail's apartment. Terry reveals that he cheated on Beth before and regrets it.\n\nKumail's parents visit, angry that he is not taking their marriage suggestions seriously. Kumail tells them that he is no longer a practicing [[Muslim]], does not want an arranged marriage, and reveals his relationship with Emily. His parents disown him. Immediately before taking the stage for an audition for the [[Montreal Comedy Festival]], Kumail learns that the infection has reached Emily's heart. Distraught, Kumail tearfully recounts his fears about Emily's condition and fails the audition.\n\nWhen Kumail mentions that Emily had an ankle injury that was slow to heal, the doctors realize she doesn\u2019t have an infection but has [[adult-onset Still's disease]], a serious but treatable autoimmune disorder. Emily wakes from her coma and, still pained from their breakup, Emily tells Kumail to leave. Nevertheless, Beth invites Kumail to Emily's homecoming party. Kumail tries to make up with Emily, but she refuses, not wanting to worsen Kumail's relationship with his family.\n\nKumail decides to move to [[New York City]] with two comedian friends. He tells his family about his plans and refuses to allow them to reject him. Emily discovers a video on [[YouTube]] of Kumail's disastrous audition and, realizing her own feelings, goes to find him after his show. Before she can explain, he tells her he is moving. Emily tells him she appreciates everything he did for her while she was in the coma and wishes him well in New York.\n\nAs Kumail prepares to depart, his parents visit. His father tells him they are still angry, but gives him a dish of his favorite food and asks him to stay in touch. As Kumail performs in New York, he is heckled by someone in the crowd; he sees that it is Emily. During the credits, photos of the real Kumail and Emily's wedding, which is attended by Kumail's family, are shown.\n\n== Cast ==\n<!--- Opening credits --->\n* [[Kumail Nanjiani]] as a fictionalized version of himself, an aspiring standup comic\n* [[Zoe Kazan]] as Emily Gardner, Kumail's girlfriend.
