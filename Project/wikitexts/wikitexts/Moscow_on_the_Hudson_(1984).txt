It co-stars [[Mar\u00eda Conchita Alonso]] (in her film debut), [[Elya Baskin]] as the circus clown, [[Savely Kramarov]] as one of two [[KGB]] [[apparatchik]]s, [[Alejandro Rey]] as the musician's immigration attorney, and [[Cleavant Derricks (actor)|Cleavant Derricks]] as his first American host and friend.\n\nThe film was released on April 6, 1984.\n\n==Plot==\nVladimir Ivanoff, a saxophonist with the Moscow circus, lives in a crowded apartment with his extended family. He stands in lines for hours to buy toilet paper and shoes. When Boris, the [[apparatchik]] assigned to the circus, criticizes Vladimir for being late to rehearsal and suggests Vladimir may miss the approaching trip to [[New York City]], Vladimir gives Boris a pair of shoes from the queue that made Vladimir late. While Ivanoff is riding in his friend Anatoly's [[Lada]], Anatoly stops to buy fuel for his car from a mobile black market gasoline dealer. While the friends wait for the gasoline seller to fill Anatoly's [[jerrycan]]s, the two practice their English.\n\nThe circus troupe is sent to perform in New York City. Anatoly, who has talked of little else but [[Defection|defecting]], can't bring himself to go through with it; and Vladimir, who had opposed the scheme as reckless and foolhardy, suddenly decides to do it. He runs from his Soviet controllers and hides behind a perfume counter at [[Bloomingdale's]] under the skirt of the clerk, Lucia Lombardo. When the [[New York City Police Department]] and the [[FBI]] arrive, Vladimir stands up to his controllers and defects with news cameras rolling. Vladimir is left with nothing but the clothes on his back, the money in his pocket, and a pair of blue jeans he had planned to buy for his girlfriend in Moscow.\n\nLionel Witherspoon, a security guard who protected Vladimir from his Russian handlers during the defection, takes him home to Harlem to live with Lionel's mother, unemployed father, sister, and grandfather\u2014a living arrangement noticeably similar to Vladimir's family back in Moscow.\n\nWith the help of sympathetic immigration attorney Orlando Ramirez, a Cuban emigrant, Vladimir soon adapts to life in the United States. Vladimir attempts to find work despite speaking little English and fearing the threat of his former [[KGB]] handlers. He initially works as a [[busboy]], [[McDonald's]] cashier, sidewalk merchant, and limousine driver. Although these jobs enable Vladimir to eventually move into his own apartment, he begins to doubt he will ever play [[saxophone]] professionally again.\n\nVladimir starts a relationship with Lucia. At a party celebrating Lucia's [[United States nationality law|becoming an American citizen]], Vladimir proposes to her; but she refuses and breaks up with him. Lionel decides to return to Alabama to be close to his minor son. However, more bad news comes in a letter from Vladimir's family that his grandfather has died.\n\nGrieving, Vladimir goes to a Russian nightclub to ease his mind. When he returns home late to his apartment building drunk, he is mugged by two African American youths. He reports the incident to the police with his attorney Orlando present; and the two go to a diner where Vladimir rants about his misfortunes. During a confrontation with a burly man who reveals himself also as a Russian defector, Vladimir comes to appreciate his good fortune of living in the United States. Soon after, Lucia reunites with Vladimir telling him that she is not ready for marriage but would love to live with an immigrant. Lionel moves back from Alabama and takes over Vladimir's job driving a limousine.\n\nVladimir encounters his former KGB handler, who is now a street vendor selling hotdogs. He admitted he had to flee the USSR himself due to his failure to prevent Vladimir's defection, but has also come to appreciate New York City. Vladimir soon gets a job in a nightclub, where he once again plays saxophone.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Robin Williams]] as Vladimir Ivanov\n* [[Mar\u00eda Conchita Alonso]] as Lucia Lombardo\n* [[Cleavant Derricks (actor)|Cleavant Derricks]] as Lionel Witherspoon\n* [[Alejandro Rey]] as Orlando Ramirez\n* [[Savely Kramarov]] as Boris\n* Oleg Rudnik as Yuri\n* [[Elya Baskin]] as Anatoly Cherkasov\n* [[Yakov Smirnoff]] as Lev\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\nAccording to Director Mazursky, the idea for the film came from Mazursky's own grandfather's emigration from Ukraine through Russia nearly 80 years before. In developing the script, the director contacted the Russian immigrant community and made his first trip to Russia. \"Most Russians,\" noted the director at the time, \"are just trying to survive. Yet, all Russians who leave their country leave behind something they treasure and love. It's a terrible conflict for them, so the act of bravery is overwhelming.\"\n\nAfter considering many locations for the Moscow portion of the film, Mazursky settled on [[Munich]], based on the flexibility [[Bavaria Studios]] offered him with full control over an authentic \"Eastern European street.\"<ref name=\"production-notes\">{{cite web| url=http://www.sonymoviechannel.com/movies/moscow-on-hudson/details| title=Moscow on the Hudson Production Notes| accessdate=February 25, 2013| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120901140122/http://www.sonymoviechannel.com/movies/moscow-on-hudson/details| archive-date=September 1, 2012}}</ref>\n\nWilliams learned Russian for the film in a crash course and also learned to play the saxophone.<ref>\"Speaks Russian Like A Czech\", Sarasota Herald-Tribune, April 14, 1984 (from the NY Times) https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1755&dat=19840414&id=ZeYbAAAAIBAJ&sjid=w2gEAAAAIBAJ&pg=6574,4734498</ref>\n\n===Lawsuit===\nThe poster, depicting a [[bird's eye view]] of New York with Moscow and Russia beyond, prompted a lawsuit by artist [[Saul Steinberg]].
