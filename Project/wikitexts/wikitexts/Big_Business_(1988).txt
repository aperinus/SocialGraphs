The [[nature versus nurture]] farce adapts ''[[The Comedy of Errors]]'', but with female siblings in contemporary society: one of each twin being reared in a wealthy urban setting, while the others grew up in a poor rural environment.\n\nProduced by [[Touchstone Pictures]], the film co-stars [[Fred Ward]], [[Edward Herrmann]], [[Joe Grifasi]], and [[Seth Green]], as well as siblings [[Michael Gross (actor)|Michael Gross]] and [[Mary Gross]]. Directed by [[Jim Abrahams]], critical reaction to the film as a whole was generally lukewarm. Both Midler and Tomlin were nominated for the [[American Comedy Award]] for Funniest Actress in a Motion Picture for their performances with Midler winning.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0094739/awards?ref_=tt_awd|date=1989|title=Big Business (1988) Awards|work=[[IMDb]]|access-date=June 30, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, the plot summary should be 400-700 words. -->\nIn 1948, wealthy businessman Hunt Shelton and his pregnant wife are lost in rural West Virginia when Mrs. Shelton goes into labor near the town of Jupiter Hollow. At the local hospital, they are turned away, because it is exclusively for employees of Hollowmade, the local furniture maker. Mr. Shelton purchases the company on the spot, and Mrs. Shelton is then admitted. The Ratliffs, an impoverished couple, arrive moments later with Mrs. Ratliff also in labor. Both women give birth to twin girls, and the elderly nurse attending the doctor [[Babies switched at birth|confuses and mixes up the sets of twins]]. Mr. Ratliff overhears the Sheltons deciding to name their daughters Rose and Sadie, and suggests the same names to his wife.\n\nForty years later, the Shelton sisters are now co-chairwomen of Moramax in New York City, a conglomerate that is the successor to their father's business interests. Sadie Shelton is focused on her career to the detriment of her family, while Rose Shelton wishes for a simpler life in the country. As part of her business plan, Sadie plans to sell Hollowmade, but must get stockholders' approval to proceed. In Jupiter Hollow, Rose Ratliff has risen to the position of forewoman at the Hollowmade Factory, and is also very career-driven. Meanwhile, Sadie Ratliff has always felt misplaced in rural life, and wishes for a more sophisticated life in a big city. Rose discovers Moramax's plans to sell Hollowmade, and makes plans to travel to New York City to stop the sale. Wanting to see the city, Sadie agrees to join her sister.\n\nWhile Sadie Shelton makes plans for the shareholders' meeting, she learns from her employee Graham Sherbourne that \"R. Ratliff\" plans to come to New York with his sister to stop the sale. Sadie orders Sherbourne to locate \"R. Ratliff\" to prevent them from appearing at the meeting. A series of mixups at JFK Airport leaves the Shelton sisters stranded while the prospective buyer of Hollowmade, Mr. Fabio Alberici, takes their limousine back to the Plaza Hotel with the Ratliff sisters. The Ratliffs are checked into the Sheltons' suite, and the Sheltons take the suite next door, leading to a series of near-misses between the four sisters, and the men who are pursuing them romantically. In the meantime, Graham and his assistant/boyfriend assume that a visitor from Jupiter Hollow, Rose Ratliff's beau Roone Dimmick, is actually \"R. Ratliff\".\n\nAll sisters discover their mixup in the lobby bathroom. After Sadie Shelton acts like she will call off the Hollowmade sale, Rose Ratliff calls her out on the strip mining plans. Rose Shelton then realizes that Sadie has been lying to her, and helps the Ratliffs trap her in the broom closet. Rose Ratliff sits outside the broom closet to keep Sadie Shelton trapped, while Rose Shelton and Sadie Ratliff attend the shareholders' meeting and stop the sale of Hollowmade. Both sets of twins later leave the Plaza hotel with their newfound loves.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Bette Midler]] as Sadie Shelton / Sadie Ratliff\n* [[Lily Tomlin]] as Rose Ratliff / Rose Shelton\n* [[Fred Ward]] as Roone Dimmick\n* [[Edward Herrmann]] as Graham Sherbourne\n* [[Michele Placido]] as Fabio Alberici\n* [[Daniel Gerroll]] as Chuck\n* [[Barry Primus]] as Michael\n* [[Michael Gross (actor)|Michael Gross]] as Dr. Jay Marshall\n* [[Deborah Rush]] as \"Binky\" Shelton\n* [[Nicolas Coster]] as Hunt Shelton\n* Patricia Gaul as Iona Ratliff\n* J.C.
