The film stars [[Christian Bale]] as [[Bruce Wayne (The Dark Knight trilogy)|Bruce Wayne / Batman]], alongside [[Michael Caine]], [[Gary Oldman]], [[Anne Hathaway]], [[Tom Hardy]], [[Marion Cotillard]], [[Joseph Gordon Levitt]], and [[Morgan Freeman]]. Eight years after the events of ''The Dark Knight'', the revolutionary [[Bane (DC Comics)|Bane]] forces Bruce Wayne to resume his role as Batman and save [[Gotham City]] from nuclear destruction.\n\nChristopher Nolan was hesitant about returning to the series for a third film, but agreed after developing a story with his brother and Goyer that he felt would conclude the series on a satisfactory note. Nolan drew inspiration from Bane's comic book debut in the 1993 \"[[Batman: Knightfall|Knightfall]]\" storyline, the 1986 series ''[[The Dark Knight Returns]]'', and the 1999 storyline \"[[Batman: No Man's Land|No Man's Land]]\". Filming took place from May to November 2011 in locations including [[Jodhpur]], [[London]], [[Nottingham]], [[Glasgow]], [[Los Angeles]], [[New York City]], [[Newark, New Jersey|Newark]], and [[Pittsburgh]]. Nolan used [[IMAX]] [[70 mm film|70&nbsp;mm film]] cameras for much of the filming, including the first six minutes of the film, to optimize the quality of the picture. A vehicle variation of the [[Batplane]] and [[Batcopter]] termed the \"Bat\", an underground prison set, and a new [[Batcave]] set were created specifically for the film. As with ''The Dark Knight'', [[viral marketing]] campaigns began early during production. When filming concluded, Warner Bros. refocused its campaign, developing promotional websites, releasing the first six minutes of the film, screening theatrical trailers, and sending out information regarding the film's plot.\n\n''The Dark Knight Rises'' premiered in New York City on July 16, 2012. The film was released in the United States and the United Kingdom on July 20, 2012. The film received positive reviews, with praise being directed toward the performances (particularly Hardy's), action sequences, direction, screenplay, musical score, and emotional depth, with many critics deeming it a satisfying conclusion to the trilogy. The film grossed over $1&nbsp;billion worldwide, making it the second film in the ''Batman'' film series to earn $1&nbsp;billion, and the highest-grossing Batman film to date.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://movieweb.com/batman-movies-box-office-gross/ |title=Batman: Every Movie in the Franchise, Ranked by Box Office Gross |publisher=Movieweb.com |date=2022-04-14 |accessdate=2022-07-30}}</ref> In addition to being Nolan's highest-grossing film, it became the [[List of highest-grossing films|<!--This is the '''peak''' position the film achieved, not the current.

[[Police commissioner]] [[James Gordon (character)|James Gordon]] has kept Dent's killing spree as \"[[Two-Face]]\" a secret and allowed the blame for his crimes to fall on [[Batman]]. Gordon has prepared a speech revealing the truth but hesitates to read it at a public celebration. Bruce Wayne, still mourning the death of [[Rachel Dawes]], has become a recluse and [[Wayne Enterprises]] is behindhand.\n\nBane enlists Bruce's corporate rival John Daggett to buy Bruce's fingerprints. Daggett hires cat burglar [[Catwoman|Selina Kyle]] to steal Bruce's prints from [[Wayne Manor]], but she double-crosses him and alerts the police. The police arrive and pursue Bane and Daggett's henchmen into the sewers while Kyle flees. The henchmen capture Gordon and take him to Bane, but he escapes and is found by officer John Blake. Blake, an orphan who has figured out Bruce's secret identity, persuades him to return as Batman.\n\nBane attacks the Gotham Stock Exchange and uses Bruce's fingerprints in a series of fraudulent transactions that leaves Bruce bankrupt. Batman resurfaces while intercepting Bane and his subordinates. Bruce's butler, [[Alfred Pennyworth]], fears that Bruce will get himself killed fighting Bane, and resigns in the hope of saving him, but only after admitting that he burned a letter that Rachel left for him saying she was going to marry Dent. Bane expands his operations and kills Daggett while Bruce and Wayne Enterprises' new CEO Miranda Tate become lovers.\n\nKyle agrees to take Batman to Bane, but instead leads him into Bane's trap. Bane gloats that he intends to fulfill [[Ra's al Ghul]]'s mission to destroy Gotham City before defeating Batman, then breaks his back before taking him abroad to an underground prison where escape is virtually impossible. The inmates tell Bruce the story of Ra's al Ghul's child, who was born and raised in the prison before escaping \u2014 the only prisoner to have done so.\n\nBane traps the police forces in the sewers and destroys all but one bridge surrounding the city. He kills Mayor Anthony Garcia and forces Pavel to convert a fusion reactor core into a decaying [[neutron bomb]] before killing him. Outside [[Blackgate Penitentiary]], Bane reads Gordon's speech to a crowd, revealing the truth about Dent. He releases the prisoners of Blackgate, instates [[martial law]] in the city, and exiles and kills Gotham's elite in [[kangaroo court]]s presided over by [[Scarecrow (DC Comics)|Jonathan Crane]].\n\nFive months later, Bruce escapes (after two prisoners adjusted his herniated disc back into place) and returns to Gotham. As Batman, he frees the police and they clash with Bane's army in the streets; during the battle, Batman overpowers Bane. Tate intervenes and stabs Batman, revealing herself as [[Talia al Ghul]], Ra's al Ghul's daughter. She attempts to activate the bomb's detonator, but the bomb fails to activate due to Gordon blocking the signal. Talia leaves to find the bomb while Bane prepares to kill Batman, but Kyle arrives and kills Bane. Batman and Kyle pursue Talia, hoping to bring the bomb back to the reactor chamber where it can be stabilized. Talia's truck crashes, but she remotely floods and destroys the reactor chamber before dying. With no way to stop the detonation, Batman uses his aerial craft, the [[Batplane|Bat]], to haul the bomb far over the bay, where it safely explodes. Before takeoff, Batman subtly reveals his identity to Gordon.\n\nIn the aftermath, Batman is presumed dead and honored as a hero. Wayne Manor becomes an orphanage and Bruce's estate is left to Alfred. Gordon finds the [[Bat Signal]] repaired, while [[Lucius Fox]] discovers that Bruce had fixed the malfunctioning auto-pilot on the Bat. While traveling abroad, Alfred glimpses Bruce alive and in a relationship with Selina Kyle  - they quietly acknowledge one other but move on without speaking. Blake, whose legal first name is revealed as [[Robin (character)|Robin]], resigns from the GCPD and receives a parcel from Bruce leading him to the [[Batcave]].\n\n==Cast==\n<!--Please re-arrange the cast according to how the film's poster does, e.g.: Bale, Caine, Oldman, Hathaway, Hardy-->\n* [[Christian Bale]] as [[Bruce Wayne (Dark Knight trilogy)|Bruce Wayne / Batman]]:<br />A billionaire socialite who dedicates himself to protecting [[Gotham City]] from its criminal underworld, as a feared vigilante.

Nolan, feeling that the use of [[film stock]] in cinema was being phased out due to the introduction of [[digital cinematography]] and projection, used this screening to make a case for the continued use of film, which he asserts still offers superior image quality to any digital format, and warned the filmmakers that unless they continued to assert their choice to use film in their productions, they may eventually lose it as an option.<ref name=\"Traditionalist\"/><ref name=\"filmvsdigital\"/> Nolan explained; \"I wanted to give them a chance to see the potential, because I think IMAX is the best film format that was ever invented. It's the gold standard and what any other technology has to match up to, but none have, in my opinion. The message I wanted to put out there was that no one is taking anyone's digital cameras away. But if we want film to continue as an option, and someone is working on a big studio movie with the resources and the power to insist [on] film, they should say so. I felt as if I didn't say anything, and then we started to lose that option, it would be a shame. When I look at a digitally acquired and projected image, it looks inferior against an original negative anamorphic print or an IMAX one.\"<ref name=\"Traditionalist\"/>\n\n===Design===\n====Costume design====\n[[File:Bane Tom Hardy5.jpg|thumb|upright|A digitally mapped model of Tom Hardy's face and skull was used to design and construct Bane's mask.]]\n[[Costume designer]] [[Lindy Hemming]] explained that Bane uses a mask to inhale an [[analgesic]] gas, which, in director Christopher Nolan's words, \"keeps his pain just below the threshold so he can function.\" In designing Bane's costume, Hemming needed it to look \"like an amalgam of all sorts of bits and pieces he cobbled together, as he passed through some very remote places. We made parts of his vest, for example, from fragments of an old military tent. His clothes are militaristic, but are not in any way a uniform.\" Hemming also designed Bane's mask to look \"animalistic\".<ref name=\"ProductionNotes\"/><ref name=\"Design2\"/><ref name=\"Design5\"/> Costume effects supervisor Graham Churchyard created a three-dimensional model of actor Tom Hardy's face and skull to design the mask, allowing the mask to perfectly conform to the contours of Hardy's face.<ref name=\"ProductionNotes\"/> Hemming personally designed Bane's coat, which she admitted took two years to complete. Taking inspiration from a [[Swedish Army|Swedish army]] jacket and a [[frock coat]] from the French Revolution, it was designed to make Bane look equal parts dictatorial and revolutionary.<ref name=\"ProductionNotes\"/> The design was difficult as Hemming struggled to find a tailor in Los Angeles who could work with [[shearling]].<ref name=\"Design4\"/>\n\nThe [[Batsuit]] consisted of 110 separate pieces, each of which had to be replicated dozens of times over the course of the production. The base layer was made of a [[polyester]] mesh that is utilized by the military and high-tech sports manufacturers because of its breathability and moisture-wicking properties. Molded pieces of flexible urethane were then attached to the mesh, to form the overall body armor plating. Carbon fiber panels were placed inside the sections on the legs, chest and abdomen. The cowl was sculpted from a cast of Bale's face and head to become a perfect fit for Christian Bale. The suit remained unchanged for the film since ''The Dark Knight''.<ref name=\"ProductionNotes\"/>\n\nIn creating Selina Kyle's catsuit, two layers of material were used, the outer layer being [[polyurethane]]-coated spandex embossed with a hexagonal pattern. The catsuit also consisted of [[evening glove|elbow-length gloves]], a [[utility belt]], and [[thigh-high boots]] with spike heels.<ref name=\"ProductionNotes\"/>\n\n====Production design====\n[[Concept artist]] Tully Summers commented on Nolan's style of [[cinematography]] when asked about the difference between his designs for this film and fantasy-based designs for ''[[Men in Black 3]]'': \"The difference for me was Christopher Nolan's visual style. One of the things that makes his Batman movies so compelling is their tone of plausibility. He will often prefer a raw, grittier design over one that is very sleek and product design pretty. It's sort of a practical military aesthetic. This stuff is made to work, not impress shoppers. ''The Dark Knight Rises'' is a war film.\" Producer [[Emma Thomas]] stated this Batman film has a different visual aesthetic from the first two Nolan-directed features, explaining that \"it's meant to be winter in Gotham, so that right there is going to lend a whole different look to the film.\"<ref name=\"Thomas\"/>\n\nThe film introduces a vehicle that has been compared with the [[Batplane]] and the [[Batcopter]], dubbed \"the Bat\". In designing the Bat, Nathan Crowley approached it as if it were an actual military project, emphasising the need for it to \"fit into the same family\" as the Tumbler and the [[Batpod]]. The final version of the Bat takes its design cues from the [[Harrier jump jet]], [[Bell Boeing V-22 Osprey]] and the [[Boeing AH-64 Apache]].<ref name=\"ProductionNotes\"/> Chris Corbould described the Bat's size and shape as presenting a major challenge for filming given Christopher Nolan's emphasis on practical effects over [[computer-generated imagery]]. In order to make the Bat \"fly\", it was variously supported by wires, suspended from cranes and helicopters, and mounted on a purpose-built vehicle with hydraulic controls to simulate movement.<ref name=\"ProductionNotes\"/><ref name=\"Design3\"/><ref name=\"Design6\"/>\n\nWhen designing the [[Batcave]] set, Crowley and fellow production designer Kevin Kavanaugh hit upon the idea of flooding the Batcave and having Batman's equipment, the [[Batsuit]] and a [[supercomputer]] rise from the water.<ref name=\"ProductionNotes\"/> Another set was designed at [[Cardington, Bedfordshire|Cardington]] as an \"underground prison\", a rough-hewn labyrinth of stone cells in a vast abyss with a {{convert|120|foot|m}} vertical shaft leading to the surface. Exteriors above the prison were filmed in [[Jodhpur]], [[India]], chosen because the \"forbidding landscape added to the desolation\".<ref name=\"ProductionNotes\"/>\n\n===Music===\n{{main|The Dark Knight Rises (soundtrack)}}\nIn an interview in October 2010, composer [[Hans Zimmer]] confirmed that he would be returning to score ''The Dark Knight Rises.'' [[James Newton Howard]] was offered to return and write the score with Zimmer as he did for ''Batman Begins'' and ''The Dark Knight'', but he chose not to because he noted that the chemistry established between Zimmer and Nolan during the making of ''Inception'' would make him seem like a \"third wheel\".<ref name=\"Howard\" /> Zimmer included several cues from the earlier scores but explained that he wanted to go in a \"completely different direction\" for Bane's theme.<ref name=\"ProductionNotes\"/>\n\nThe film features a prevalent chant of the phrase \"''Deshi Basara''\".<ref>{{cite web |date=July 25, 2012 |title=Hans Zimmer Speaks On The \"Deshi Basara\" Chant In \"The Dark Knight Rises\" |url=http://www.flicksandbits.com/2012/07/25/hans-zimmer-speaks-on-the-deshi-basara-chant-in-the-dark-knight-rises/28983/ |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130109150657/http://www.flicksandbits.com/2012/07/25/hans-zimmer-speaks-on-the-deshi-basara-chant-in-the-dark-knight-rises/28983/ |archive-date=January 9, 2013 |access-date=December 28, 2012 |website=Flicks and Bits}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Eisenberg |first=Eric |date=November 4, 2011 |title=Be Part of the Dark Knight Rises Score By Recording Yourself Chanting |url=https://www.cinemablend.com/new/Part-Dark-Knight-Rises-Score-By-Recording-Yourself-Chanting-27748.html |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111106161233/https://www.cinemablend.com/new/Part-Dark-Knight-Rises-Score-By-Recording-Yourself-Chanting-27748.html |archive-date=2012-11-06 |access-date=July 23, 2012 |work=CinemaBlend}}</ref> In November 2011, Zimmer [[crowdsourcing|crowdsourced]] online audio recordings of the chant to be used in the film's score.<ref name=\"Music1\"/><ref name=\"TDKRChant\"/> When asked about the chant for clarification, Zimmer said, \"The chant became a very complicated thing because I wanted hundreds of thousands of voices, and it's not so easy to get hundreds of thousands of voices.

The website streamed an encrypted audio file described by users as chanting. Users decrypted the audio to the Twitter hashtag, \"#TheFireRises\". Warner Bros. removed a pixel from the webpage for every tweet using the hashtag. The website revealed the first official image of Bane.<ref name=\"Marketing1\"/>\n\nIn July 2011, a teaser trailer leaked online before its official release with ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows \u2013 Part 2]]''.<ref name=Davis/> The studio released the teaser three days after the leak. The trailer received mixed responses; Stephen Spencer Davis of ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'' wrote it successfully built hype,<ref name=Davis /> while Kofi Outlaw of ''[[Screen Rant]]'' showed disappointment, claiming it was more of an \"announcement trailer\" than an actual teaser trailer. Outlaw criticized the quality, writing that a scene depicting Commissioner Gordon in a hospital bed was overly dramatic, had \"hammy\" dialogue, and was difficult to understand due to Gordon's labored breathing. Outlaw wrote that the sweeping shot of Gotham City had poor CGI and was too reminiscent of the ''Inception'' trailer.<ref name=Outlaw/> The theatrical trailer leaked online, like the teaser trailer, before being released the following week attached to theatrical prints of ''[[Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows]]''.<ref name=\"TDKRtrailer1\"/><ref name=\"Marketing3\"/><ref name=\"Marketing4\"/> Critics noted political undertones with dialogue foreshadowing the theme of [[Economic inequality|income inequality]] and an \"[[Occupy movement|Occupy Gotham]]\" campaign within the world of the story.<ref name=\"Marketing5\"/><ref name=\"Marketing6\"/><ref name=\"Marketing8\"/> Receiving more than 12.5&nbsp;million views in the first 24 hours after its release, the trailer set the record for most combined downloads from [[iTunes]], beating the previous record held by ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]''.<ref name=\"Marketing9\"/> However, the second trailer for ''The Avengers'' again set the record with 13.7&nbsp;million downloads.<ref name=\"NYDailyNews\" /> Warner Bros. attached a second theatrical trailer for ''The Dark Knight Rises'' to theatrical prints of ''The Avengers''. An \"unnamed\" Warner Brothers executive clarified that \"We see this placement as a good strategic decision. We always want our trailers to be seen with films that people want to see\u2014and a lot of people will be going to The Avengers!\" The executive also commented that the trailer will \"provide the best potential exposure for TDKR.\"<ref name=\"TDKRtrailer2\"/> Warner Bros. released the trailer online on April 30, 2012, approximately four days before they attached it to theatrical prints of ''The Avengers''.<ref name=\"TDKRtrailer3\"/>\n\nContinuing a method used with ''The Dark Knight'' whereby the opening sequence of the film was attached to IMAX prints of ''[[I Am Legend (film)|I Am Legend]]'' seven months before release,<ref name=TDKopening/> a six-minute prologue of ''The Dark Knight Rises'' was attached to 70mm IMAX prints of ''[[Mission: Impossible \u2013 Ghost Protocol]]'', again approximately seven months before release.<ref name=\"6Minutes\"/> Critical reaction to the prologue was positive.<ref name=\"MarketingProlog1\"/><ref name=\"MarketingProlog2\"/><ref name=\"MarketingProlog3\"/> Addressing the issue in an interview with ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'', Nolan said \"I think when people see the film, things will come into focus. Bane is very complex and very interesting and when people see the finished film people will be very entertained by him.\"<ref name=\"BaneVoice\" />\n\n[[File:Batsignal at Highmark building.jpg|thumb|The [[Bat-Signal]] projected against the [[Fifth Avenue Place (Pittsburgh)|Fifth Avenue Place]] during filming in [[Pittsburgh]].]]\nViral marketing campaigns for the film continued as magazine companies ''[[Empire (film magazine)|Empire]]'' and ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' received \"[[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] documents\" concerning a \"Dr. Leonid Pavel\", with its mugshot connected to actor Alon Abutbul. According to the first document, Pavel is a missing Russian [[nuclear physics|nuclear physicist]], while the second document appears to be an edited transcript of a conversation discussing the handover of Dr. Pavel to the CIA by Georgian separatists, but with most of the conversation redacted.<ref name=\"Marketing2\"/> These were later shown to be plot elements of the six-minute prologue.<ref name=\"MarketingProlog1\"/> The official Twitter account later linked to another censored document, this time, referencing \"Operation Early Bird\". A website of the same name was discovered, revealing a countdown timer. When the countdown finished, the site presented a map showing all available theaters that would be screening the film's prologue earlier than its release.<ref name=\"Earlybird\"/><ref name=\"Earlybird2\"/> \n\nVarious websites received a package that included a cylinder map of \"strike zones\", and a \"fire rises\" [[T-shirt]].<ref name=\"Marketing12\"/> In April 2012, the film's official website was updated with a \"dossier\" on a suspect named \"John Doe\" also known as \"the Batman\" for an arrest, with a list of several accusations. The premise of the campaign starts when the mayor of Gotham City \"redoubles\" the effort to capture Batman and anyone supporting his return in preparation for the upcoming \"Harvey Dent Day\". The site also includes an extensive list of real-world locations where \"graffiti related to movement in support of the vigilante's return\" is located. For each tweet of a specific location marked on the list, a frame of the second theatrical trailer for the film was released on a separate website.<ref name=\"Marketing21\"/>\n\nIn January 2012, six months prior to the film's release, tickets for midnight IMAX showings in New York, San Francisco, and Los Angeles went on sale and sold out immediately. Purchased tickets surfaced for sale online for over $100, compared with their original price of $17.50.<ref name=\"Marketing10\" />\n\n[[File:2012 British GP - Lotus.jpg|thumb|Formula One team [[Lotus F1]] carried a special livery to promote ''The Dark Knight Rises'' at the [[2012 British Grand Prix]].]]\nAt the [[American International Toy Fair]], [[Mattel]] unveiled figures for Batman, Bane, Catwoman, and Batman's flying vehicle, the Bat. The Mattel figures were also released in the \"Movie Masters\" line, featuring more highly detailed and articulated presentation, and Quiktek versions that feature interchangeable accessories. [[Lego]] released building sets and mini-figures based on the film and incorporating other DC Comic characters. Additionally, [[Funko]] released a series of [[plush]] toys, [[Mezco Toyz]] released vinyl figures, and [[Hornby Railways|Hornby]] released the Batman Tumbler car.<ref name=\"Marketing11\" /> Other partners include [[Jakks Pacific]], who created novelty and large-scale figures and plush toys,<ref name=\"Marketing13\"/> and PPW Toys, who created a Batman themed [[Mr. Potato Head]].<ref name=\"Marketing14\"/> Various clothing items including shoes, T-shirts, hats and wallets were also produced.<ref name=\"Marketing15\"/>\n\nA video game of the same name was released on the same day as the release of the film for the [[iOS]] and [[Android (operating system)|Android]] devices for promoting the movie.

The combat system of the game is inspired from [[Batman: Arkham Asylum|Arkham Asylum]] and [[Batman: Arkham City|Arkham City]]. It takes place in Gotham City, with a somewhat similar but still significantly different plot from that of the movie.

What we're really trying to do is show the cracks of society, show the conflicts that somebody would try to wedge open. We're going to get wildly different interpretations of what the film is supporting and not supporting, but it's not doing any of those things. It's just telling a story.
