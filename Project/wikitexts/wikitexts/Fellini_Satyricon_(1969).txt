The film is divided into nine episodes, following Encolpius ([[Martin Potter (actor)|Martin Potter]]) and his friend Ascyltus ([[Hiram Keller]]) as they try to win the heart of a young boy named Git\u00f3n within a surreal and dreamlike Roman landscape.\n\n''Fellini Satyricon'' was entered into the [[30th Venice International Film Festival]], where it won the Pasinetti Award for Best Italian Film. It received acclaim from international critics, with particular praise toward Fellini's direction and [[Danilo Donati]]'s vivid production design. The film earned Fellini his third [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]], and the film was nominated for the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Foreign Language Film]].\n\n==Plot==\nThe film opens on a graffiti-covered wall with Encolpius lamenting the loss of his lover Git\u00f3n to Ascyltus. Vowing to win him back, he learns at the [[Thermae]] that Ascyltus sold Git\u00f3n to the actor Vernacchio. At the theatre, he discovers Vernacchio and Git\u00f3n performing in a lewd play called the \"Emperor's Miracle\": a slave's hand is axed off and replaced with a gold one. Encolpius storms the stage and reclaims Git\u00f3n. On their return to Encolpius's home in the Insula Felicles, a Roman tenement building, they walk through the vast Roman brothel known as the Lupanare, observing numerous sensual scenes. They fall asleep after making love at Encolpius's place. Ascyltus sneaks into the room, waking Encolpius with a whiplash. Since both share the tenement room, Encolpius proposes they divide up their property and separate. Ascyltus mockingly suggests they split Git\u00f3n in half. Encolpius is driven to suicidal despair, however, when Git\u00f3n decides to leave with Ascyltus. At that moment, an earthquake destroys the tenement.\n\nEncolpius meets the poet Eumolpus at the art museum. The elderly poet blames current corruption on the mania for money and invites his young friend to a banquet held at the villa of Trimalchio, a wealthy freeman, and his wife Fortunata. Eumolpus's declamation of poetry is met with catcalls and thrown food. While Fortunata performs a frantic dance, the bored Trimalchio turns his attention to two very young boys. Scandalized, Fortunata berates her husband, who attacks her then has her covered in gizzards and gravy. Fancying himself a poet, Trimalchio recites one of his finer poems whereupon Eumolpus accuses him of stealing verses from [[Lucretius]]. Enraged, Trimalchio orders the poet to be tortured by his slaves in the villa's huge kitchen furnace. The guests are then invited to visit Trimalchio's tomb where he enacts his own death in an ostentatious ceremony. The story of the Matron of Ephesus is recounted, the first [[story within a story]] in the film.<ref>Bondanella, 260</ref> Encolpius finally leaves the villa, helping the limping, beaten Eumolpus to drink water from a pool in a tilled field. In return for his kindness, Eumolpus bequeaths the spirit of poetry to his young friend.\n\nThe next morning Encolpius, Git\u00f3n, and Ascyltus are imprisoned on the pirate ship of Lichas, a middle-aged merchant; they are part of a consignment of attractive young men being delivered for the titillation of the reclusive Roman emperor. Lichas selects Encolpius for a Greco-Roman wrestling match and quickly subdues him. Smitten by his beauty, Lichas takes Encolpius as his spouse in a wedding ceremony blessed by his wife, Tryphaena. After a long voyage the ship arrives at the emperor's private island, only to find it overrun by soldiers in the service of a usurper. The teenage emperor kills himself, and the soldiers board the ship and behead Lichas under Tryphaena's satisfied gaze. While \"new Caesar\" holds a fearsome victory parade back in Rome, Encolpius and Ascyltus escape the soldiers and make their way inland. They discover an abandoned villa, whose owners have freed their slaves and committed suicide to escape the new emperor. Encolpius and Ascyltus spend the night on the property and make love with an African slave girl who has stayed behind. Fleeing the villa when soldiers on horseback arrive in the courtyard to burn the owners' corpses, the two friends reach a desert. Ascyltus placates a nymphomaniac's demands in a covered wagon while Encolpius waits outside, listening to the woman's servant discuss a [[hermaphrodite]] demi-god reputed to possess healing powers at the Temple of [[Ceres (Roman mythology)|Ceres]]. With the aid of a mercenary, they kill two men and kidnap the hermaphrodite in the hope of obtaining a ransom. Once exposed to the desert sun, however, the hermaphrodite sickens and dies of thirst. Enraged, the mercenary tries to murder his two companions but is overpowered and killed.\n\nCaptured by soldiers, Encolpius is released in a labyrinth and forced to play Theseus to a gladiator's Minotaur for the amusement of spectators at the festival of [[Momus]], the God of Laughter. When the gladiator spares Encolpius's life because of his well-spoken words of mercy, the festival rewards the young man with Ariadne, a sensual woman with whom he must copulate as the crowd looks on. Impotent, Encolpius is publicly humiliated by Ariadne. Eumolpus offers to take him to the Garden of Delights where prostitutes are said to effect a cure for his impotence but the treatment\u2014gentle whipping of the buttocks\u2014fails miserably. In the second of the stories within a story in the film, the owner of the Garden of Delights narrates the tale of Oenothea to Encolpius. For having rejected his advances, [[Virgilius the Sorcerer|a sorcerer curses a beautiful young woman]]: she must spend her days kindling fires for the village's hearths from her genitalia. Inspired, Encolpius and Ascyltus hire a boatman to take them to Oenothea's home. Greeted by an old woman who has him drink a potion, Encolpius falls under a spell where his sexual prowess is restored to him by Oenothea in the form of an [[Mother goddess#Earth Mother|Earth Mother]] figure and sorceress. When Ascyltus is murdered in a field by the boatman, Encolpius decides to join Eumolpus's ship bound for North Africa. But Eumolpus has died in the meantime, leaving as his heirs all those willing to eat his corpse. Encolpius hasn't the stomach for this last and bitter mockery but is nonetheless invited by the captain to board the ship. In a voice-over, Encolpius explains that he set sail with the captain and his crew. His words end in mid-sentence, as does Petronius's book, when a distant island appears on the horizon and the film cuts abruptly to frescoes of the film's characters on a crumbling wall.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Martin Potter (actor)|Martin Potter]] as Encolpius\n* [[Hiram Keller]] as Ascyltus\n* Max Born as Git\u00f3n\n* [[Salvo Randone]] as Eumolpus\n* Mario Romagnoli as [[Trimalchio]]\n* [[Magali No\u00ebl]] as Fortunata\n* [[Capucine]] as Tryphaena\n* [[Alain Cuny]] as Lichas\n* [[Fanfulla]] as Vernacchio\n* [[Donyale Luna]] as Oenothea\n* {{ill|Danika La Loggia|it}} as Scintilla\n* Giuseppe Sanvitale as [[Habinnas]]\n* Eugenio Mastropietro as Hermeros\n* [[Lucia Bos\u00e8]] as the suicidal wife\n* Joseph Wheeler as the suicidal husband\n* Hylette Adolphe as the slave girl\n* [[Tanya Lopert]] as the Emperor\n* [[Gordon Mitchell]] as the thief\n* [[George Eastman (actor)|Luigi Montefiori]] as the [[Minotaur]]\n* [[Marcella Di Folco]] as the [[Proconsul]]\n* [[Elisa Mainardi]] as Arianna\n* Pasquale Baldassarre as [[Hermaphroditus]]\n* Carlo Giordana as the ship captain\n* [[Alvaro Vitali]] as [[Julius Caesar]]\n* Sibilla Sedat as Nymphomaniac\n* [[Lorenzo Piani]] as Nymphomaniac's husband\n* [[Federico Boido]] as Scarface\n* [[Samson Burke]] as gladiator\n* [[Francesco Di Giacomo]] as lyre player\n* [[Richard Simmons]] as a slave\n* [[Suleiman Ali Nashnush]] as Tryphaena's attendant\n* [[Jessica Dublin]] as dancer at feast\n* [[Carole Andr\u00e9]] as boy kissing boy\n* [[Renato Zero]]}}\n\n==Adaptation==\n[[Petronius]]'s original text survives only in fragments. While recuperating from a debilitating illness in 1967, Fellini reread Petronius and was fascinated by the missing parts, the large gaps between one episode and the next.<ref name=\"Bondanella, 239\">Bondanella, 239</ref> The text's fragmentary nature encouraged him to go beyond the traditional approach of recreating the past in film: the key to a visionary cinematic adaptation lay in narrative techniques of the dream state that exploited the dream's imminent qualities of mystery, enigma, immorality, outlandishness, and contradiction.<ref name=\"Bondanella, 239\"/> In ''Comments on Film'', Fellini explained that his goal in adapting Petronius's classic was \"to eliminate the borderline between dream and imagination: to invent everything and then to objectify the fantasy; to get some distance from it in order to explore it as something all of a piece and unknowable.\"<ref>Fellini, ''Comments on Film'', 173</ref> Critic Christopher Sharrett observes that Fellini's \"adaptation also reveals the paucity of the source, the kitschiness of the 'big ideas' from literary history. Genre film is a comfortable vehicle for the critical agenda undertaken, as Fellini piles up genre tropes as a way of showing the inherent generic contrivance, the 'trashiness,' that is basic to all such representation.\"<ref>Sharrett, \"Intertext and the End of Humanism\" in ''Federico Fellini: Contemporary Perspectives'' (ed. Burke and Waller), Toronto: Toronto University Press (2002), 125.</ref>\n\nThe most important of the narrative changes<ref>According to Bondanella, 246</ref> that Fellini makes to Petronius's text is the addition of a battle between Encolpius and the [[Minotaur]] in the [[Labyrinth]] thereby linking Encolpius to [[Theseus]] and the journey into the unconscious. Other original sequences include a nymphomaniac in a desert caravan whose despondent husband pays Ascyltus and Encolpius to couple with her, and a hermaphrodite worshipped as a demigod at the [[Ceres (mythology)|Temple of Ceres]]. Abducted by the two protagonists and a mercenary, the hermaphrodite later dies a miserable death in a desert landscape that, in Fellini's adaptation, is posed as an ill-omened event, none of which is to be found in the Petronian version.\n\nThough the two protagonists, Encolpius and Ascyltus, appear throughout, the characters and locations surrounding them change unexpectedly. This intentional technique of fragmentation conveys Fellini's view of both the original text and the nature of history itself, and is echoed visually in the film's final shot of a ruined villa whose walls, painted with frescoes of the scenes we have just seen, are crumbling, fading and incomplete.<ref>Bondanella, 240.</ref> Fellini's interest in [[Carl Jung]]'s theory of the [[collective unconscious]] is also on display with an abundance of [[archetypes]] in highly dreamlike settings.<ref>Bondanella, 240</ref>\n\n== Production ==\nFellini's project saw competition from another film titled ''[[Satyricon (1969 Polidoro film)|Satyricon]]'', released the same year. Producer [[Alfredo Bini]] had registered the ''Satyricon'' title in 1962. When Fellini and his producer [[Alberto Grimaldi]] started work on their film, Bini contracted [[Gian Luigi Polidoro]] to direct his own version. Grimaldi sued Bini to halt the competing film, but lost; as a result, Fellini's picture was titled ''Fellini Satyricon'' to distinguish it.<ref>Kezich, 292</ref>\n\nFilming took place primarily at [[Cinecitt\u00e0|Cinecitt\u00e0 Studios]], on sets designed by [[Danilo Donati]], who also designed the production's costumes. The film also used exteriors locations at [[Fiumicino]], [[Latina, Lazio|Latina]], and the [[Pontine Islands]]. The cavern sequences were filmed below the [[Colosseum|Roman Colosseum]]. Co-screenwriter [[Bernardino Zapponi]] noted that Fellini used a deliberately jerky form of dubbing that caused the dialogue to appear out of sync with the actors' lips. This was in keeping with his original intention of creating a profound sense of estrangement throughout the film.<ref>Bondanella, 244</ref>\n\n==Release==\n===Home media===\n''Fellini Satyricon'' was released on [[VHS]] by [[20th Century Fox Home Entertainment]] on 7 September 1999.<ref>{{cite web|title=VHS: Fellini Satyricon|url=http://www.tower.com/fellini-satyricon-martin-potter-vhs/wapi/107705384|website=[[Tower.com]]|publisher=Tower.com Inc.|access-date=12 September 2015}}</ref> The film was then released on [[DVD]] by [[MGM Home Entertainment|Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Home Entertainment]] on 10 April 2001, for [[DVD region code#1|Region 1]] and on 15 May 2005, for the German market.{{citation needed|date=January 2022}}\n\nOn 24 February 2015, [[The Criterion Collection]] released the film, newly restored through a 4K digital transfer, on [[Blu-ray]] and [[DVD]] for Region A and Region 1 respectively.

The rampant moralizing of ten years ago seems to have passed out of fashion\".<ref>Kezich, 287</ref> In his favorable ''[[Corriere della Sera]]'' review, Giovanni Grazzini argued that \"Fellini's Rome bears absolutely no relationship to the Rome we learned about in school books. It is a place outside historical time, an area of the unconscious in which the episodes related by Petronius are relived among the ghosts of Fellini&nbsp;... His ''Satyricon'' is a journey through a fairytale for adults. It is evident that Fellini, finding in these ancient personages the projection of his own human and artistic doubts, is led to wonder if the universal and eternal condition of man is actually summed up in the frenzied realization of the transience of life which passes like a shadow. These ancient Romans who spend their days in revelry, ravaged by debauchery, are really an unhappy race searching desperately to exorcise their fear of death\".<ref>Grazzini's review first published in ''[[Corriere della Sera]]'', 5 September 1969. Fava and Vigano, 135</ref>\n\nKezich saw the film as a study in self-analysis, stating: \"Everything seems to be aimed at making the viewer feel ill at ease, at giving him the impression that he is watching for the first time scenes from a life he never dreamed could have existed. Fellini has described his film as 'science fiction of the past', as though the Romans of that decadent age were being observed by the astounded inhabitants of a flying saucer. Curiously enough, in this effort of objectivity, the director has created a film that is so subjective as to warrant psychoanalysis. It is pointless to debate whether the film proposes a plausible interpretation of ancient Rome, or whether in some way it illustrates Petronius: the least surprising parts are those that come closest to Petronius's text or that have some vague historical significance...\"<ref>Kezich's review first published in ''Panorama'', 18 September 1969.
