It stars [[Nathan Baesel]], [[Angela Goethals]], [[Scott Wilson (actor)|Scott Wilson]], [[Zelda Rubenstein]], and [[Robert Englund]]. A homage to the [[Slasher film|slasher]] genre, the film follows a journalist and her crew that are documenting an aspiring [[serial killer]] who models himself according to slasher film conventions.\n\n[[Principal photography]] took place in [[Oregon]], although the story takes place in a small town in [[Maryland]]. The film premiered at the 2006 [[South by Southwest]] film festival and was shown at several other festivals followed by a [[limited release]] in the United States on March 16, 2007. It is Zelda Rubenstein's final film released during her lifetime before her death in 2010.\n\n==Plot==\nThe film is shot as a documentary set in a world where the killers depicted in famous [[slasher film]]s are historical figures. A journalist named Taylor Gentry and her two cameramen, Doug and Todd, document the preparations of Leslie Vernon as he prepares to join the ranks of other slasher villains. Leslie claims to be a boy from a local [[urban legend]] who supposedly became possessed and killed his family before being killed by the townsfolk, but having in fact survived the attack. He walks Taylor and her crew through his plans but refuses to truly explain his motives.\n\nLeslie plans to orchestrate a killing spree at his alleged family home, a rundown farm in the woods. At the farm, he plans to slaughter a number of teenagers before being confronted by his chosen virginal \"[[Final girl|survivor girl]]\", a local seventeen-year-old high school student named Kelly Curtis. In addition to a strict training regime and learning theater techniques to create the proper atmosphere, he has rigged the farm to be in his favor: sealing off exits within the house, mapping the routes his victims will take, rigging the electrical system to fail, and tampering with potential weapons in the barn. Leslie also discusses the bizarre behavior of people in such circumstances, such as [[Trope (cinema)|herding together without really protecting themselves, tripping on level and stable ground, and attempting to hide in obvious and dangerous locations.]]\n\nDuring the documentary shoot, Leslie introduces Taylor and her crew to his mentor, [[Billy (Black Christmas)|Eugene]], who vaguely elaborates on the motives of killers like himself: for them to be a sacrifice by acting as evil to counter and even bring out the good within the world. Eugene's wife offhandedly suggests killing the local librarian, Mrs. Collinwood, as a stinger kill in order to draw Kelly in, which he does after Eugene agrees that it's a good idea. However, Leslie's claim to be Leslie Vernon avenging his death is proven false when a psychiatrist, Doc Halloran, interrupts Taylor and her crew, revealing that Leslie is in fact an ordinary, mentally-unstable man named Leslie Mancuso, whom Halloran treated in [[Reno, Nevada]]. Taylor confronts Leslie about Halloran's allegation and Leslie becomes aggressive with her. Taylor contemplates ending the documentary, but reconciles with Leslie and chooses to continue filming. Taylor and her crew continue to film Leslie's meticulous preparations for his killing spree.\n\nThough Taylor and her crew possess enthusiasm for Leslie's creativity, their consciences catch up with them on the night of the murders. They beg Leslie to call off his killing spree, but Leslie is adamant, believing that his survivor girl will define herself by facing him. He implores and invites the crew to leave but they ultimately decide to stop Leslie. At this point, the film's [[mise-en-sc\u00e8ne]] shifts from documentary mode to a standard [[horror film]] presentation. Taylor attempts to warn and rally the remaining teens together to fight Leslie, attempting to use the knowledge they have against Leslie, but Leslie's preparations appear to have expected the crew remaining. The group looks to Kelly - who is revealed to not be a virgin - for leadership, but she unexpectedly dies when trying to escape. Taylor struggles to keep the teenagers from bumbling through Leslie's preordained schedule, with Todd sacrificing himself by drawing Leslie away from the house, one of the few disruptions that Leslie mentioned as being potentially ruinous to his plan.\n\nTaylor quickly realizes that, as a virgin herself, she was Leslie's intended survivor girl all along. Leslie continues picking off the group one-by-one until only Taylor remains. She faces Leslie and defeats him in the exact manner he had laid out for her, crushing Leslie's head in the apple press, then burns down the shed in which he was defeated, apparently killing him. Outside, she finds Doug and Doc Halloran, who have both survived their encounters with Leslie.\n\nOver the final credits, security camera footage reveals Leslie's charred body sitting up on an autopsy table, still alive.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Nathan Baesel]] as Leslie Vernon / Leslie Mancuso\n* [[Angela Goethals]] as Taylor Gentry\n* [[Robert Englund]] as Doc Halloran\n* [[Kate Lang Johnson]] as Kelly\n* [[Scott Wilson (actor)|Scott Wilson]] as Eugene\n* [[Zelda Rubinstein]] as Mrs. Collinwood\n* Bridgett Newton as Jamie\n* Ben Pace as Doug\n* Krissy Carlson as Lauren\n* Britain Spellings as Todd\n* Hart Turner as Shane\n* Travis Zariwny as Dr. Meuller\n* Teo Gomez as Stoned Guy\n* Matt Bolt as Slightly More Stoned Guy\n* Jenafer Brown as Virgin Girl\n* [[Kane Hodder]] as Guy at Elm Street House\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Portland Central Library, Oregon (2012) - 090.JPG|thumb|right|upright=1|One of the film's key sequences was shot at the [[Central Library (Portland, Oregon)|Central Library]] in Portland, Oregon]]\n''Behind the Mask'' was filmed largely in [[Portland, Oregon]] and the outlying towns of [[Troutdale, Oregon|Troutdale]], [[Banks, Oregon|Banks]], [[St. Helens, Oregon|St. Helens]], [[Estacada, Oregon|Estacada]], and [[Sauvie Island]].<ref name=\"making\">Making of ''Behind the Mask'' (DVD) 2007, Anchor Bay Entertainment</ref> The establishing shots of [[Glen Echo, Maryland|Glen Echo]] were filmed on Main Street in downtown Troutdale.

It had a lot of interesting things to say. Today, that script, that film, is almost like a period piece because I don't necessarily want to bring it up to current day, and yet, certain things may feel a little bit old or period, depending on how you look at it. I think we captured the essence of what was happening several years ago. If we do get the opportunity to make the film, I'm not sure I'd want to make the screenplay any more current.
