Its story centers on a group of children in a depressed small town in [[North Carolina]] who band together to cover up a tragic mistake.\n\nThe film premiered at the 2000 [[Berlin International Film Festival]] and received wide praise from critics.\n\n==Plot==\nThe film follows a group of kids growing up in a depressed rural town in North Carolina, as seen through the eyes of 12-year-old Nasia (Candace Evanofski). After breaking up with her show-off boyfriend Buddy (Curtis Cotton III), she withdraws from her delinquent friends and becomes romantically interested in a strange, introverted boy named George Richardson (Donald Holden) who is burdened by the fact that his skull never hardened after birth. Tragedy strikes when George accidentally kills Buddy, and the group, fearing punishment, decide to hide his body. In its aftermath, George takes up the unlikely role of town hero.\n\n==Cast==\n* Candace Evanofski as Nasia \n* Curtis Cotton III as Buddy \n* Donald Holden as George Richardson \n* Damian Jewan Lee as Vernon \n* Rachael Handy as Sonya\n* [[Paul Schneider (actor)|Paul Schneider]] as Rico Rice \n* [[Eddie Rouse]] as Damascus \n* Janet Taylor as Aunt Ruth\n\n==Production==\n''George Washington'' marked David Gordon Green's feature film debut as a [[screenwriter]], [[film director]] and [[film producer]].<ref name=thr>{{cite news|first=Mike |last=Barnes |title=Character Actor Eddie Rouse Dies at 60 |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/eddie-rouse-dead-character-actor-755345 |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |date=December 8, 2014 |accessdate=December 21, 2014}}</ref> It was also the first feature film role for actor Eddie Rouse.<ref name=thr/>\n\n==Reception==\nThe film has an 84% approval rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on 61 reviews, with an average rating of 7.39/10.
