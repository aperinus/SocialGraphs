The screenwriter was Nair's creative collaborator [[Sooni Taraporevala]]. This was the [[List of directorial debuts|first feature film]] directed by Nair. The film depicts the daily lives of children living in [[slums]] in [[Bombay]] (now [[Mumbai]]), India's largest city. It stars [[Shafiq Syed]], [[Raghubir Yadav|Raghuvir Yadav]], [[Anita Kanwar]], [[Nana Patekar]], Hansa Vithal and [[Chanda Sharma]].\n\nNair's inspiration for the film came from the spirit of Bombay's street children and how they lived. Production began in early 1988, and the film was co-financed by the [[National Film Development Corporation of India]]. After being released worldwide on 6 October 1988, the film grossed an estimated {{US$|7.4 million|long=no}} at the overseas box office, against a production budget of only $450,000.\n\nNominated for the [[Academy Award for Best International Feature Film]] at the [[61st Academy Awards]], the film was India's [[List of Indian submissions for Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film|second film submission to be so nominated]]. After its initial release on 11 May 1988 at the [[1988 Cannes Film Festival]], ''Salaam Bombay!'' achieved significant critical acclaim. It won the [[Cam\u00e9ra d'Or]] and Audience award at the Cannes Film Festival. The film won the [[National Film Award for Best Feature Film in Hindi]], [[National Board of Review Award for Best Foreign Language Film]] and three awards at the [[Montreal World Film Festival]]. The film was among the list of \"The Best 1,000 Movies Ever Made\" by ''[[The New York Times]]''.{{r|1000best}}\n\n==Plot==\nBefore the start of the film, Krishna has set fire to his elder brother's motor-bike as retaliation for being bullied by him. His angry mother has taken him to the nearby Apollo Circus and told him that he can only come home when he earns 500 rupees to pay for the damage. Krishna agrees and starts work for the circus.\n\nThe film begins as the circus is packing up to move on to its next site. His boss asks him to run an errand but when Krishna returns he finds that the circus has left. Alone, with nowhere to turn, and without the money to repay his mother, he travels to the nearest big city, Bombay. As soon as he arrives, he is robbed of his few possessions. He follows the thieves, befriends them, and ends up in the city's notorious red-light area of [[Kamathipura|Falkland Road]], near the [[Grant Road]] Railway Station.\n\nOne of the thieves, Chillum, a drug pusher and addict, helps Krishna to get a job at the Grant Road Tea Stall, and becomes a mentor of sorts to him. Baba, a local drug dealer, employs addicts like Chillum. Baba's wife, Rekha, is a prostitute and they have a little daughter, Manju. Rekha is annoyed that she has to raise her daughter in such an environment. Baba had promised to start a new life elsewhere, but it is a promise which Baba cannot, or will not, fulfill.\n\nKrishna gets a new name, \"Chaipau\", and learns to live with it. His goal is still to raise the money he needs to return home, but soon finds out that saving money in his new surroundings is next to impossible. To make matters worse, he has a crush on a young girl named Sola Saal, who has been recently sold to the brothel. He sets fire to her room and attempts to escape with her, but they are caught. The fire causes Krishna to get a severe beating, while Sola Saal, who is considered valuable since she is still a virgin, denies starting the fire and tearfully tries to resist her enslavement. The madame of the house asks Baba to \"tame her,\" which Baba agrees to do.\n\nMeanwhile, Krishna, as well as working at the tea stall, works odd jobs to save some money and help Chillum, who cannot survive without drugs, especially after being sacked by Baba after a disastrous interview with a foreign journalist. Eventually, one of these odd jobs costs Krishna his job at the tea stall. To get more money, Krishna and his pals rob an elderly Parsi man by breaking into his house in broad daylight. Krishna eventually finds out that the money he had saved eventually has been stolen by Chillum for drugs, which he had overdosed on fatally.\n\nOne night, while returning home from work with friends, Krishna and Manju are apprehended by the police and taken to a juvenile home. Eventually, Krishna escapes and goes back to his world. He finds that a new recruit in Baba's drug business has taken Chillum's place and name. Krishna meets Sola Saal and tries to convince her to run away with him. She reveals that she is charmed by Baba and no longer interested in Krishna; she is driven away to service her first 'client'. Meanwhile, Rekha is told that the authorities will not release their daughter, because the mother is a prostitute. An angry Rekha decides to leave Baba, but Baba beats her in retaliation. She is saved by the timely intervention of Krishna who, in a fit of rage, kills Baba and attempts to run away with Rekha, but they become separated in a parade honoring Ganesh. The film ends with a slow zoom in to Krishna's dejected face, alone and being thrown back to the same reality he started out with in the film.\n\n==Cast==\n<!--as per appearance, please DO NOT CHANGE without discussion-->\n{{div col}}\n*[[Shafiq Syed]] as Krishna, nicknamed Chaipau\n*[[Raghuvir Yadav]] as Chillum (credited as Raghubir Yadav)\n*Hansa Vithal as Manju\n*[[Anita Kanwar]] as Rekha\n*[[Nana Patekar]] as Baba\n*[[Chanda Sharma]] as Sola Saal, nicknamed Sweet Sixteen\n*[[Irrfan Khan]] as Letter writer\n*[[Sanjana Kapoor]] as Foreigner reporter\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Pre-production==\n===Writing and inspiration===\n{| class=\"toccolours\" style=\"float: right; margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 2em; font-size: 85%; background:#c6dbf7; color:black; width:30em; max-width: 40%;\" cellspacing=\"5\"\n| style=\"text-align: left;\" | \"One of my first images was of kids surrounding my taxi at a traffic junction- blowing bubbles, singing, a maimed kid on a makeshift skateboard.

Her ideas developed when she researched the lives of the children with her creative partner [[Sooni Taraporevala]]. From the beginning, they decided that real street children would play in the film since the combination of childhood and knowledge in their faces would be hard to find among professional child actors.{{r|Rahman}}\n\nNair was also inspired to make the film after watching [[H\u00e9ctor Babenco]]'s [[Drama Film|drama]] ''[[Pixote]]'' (1981). She said, \"on the first day of shooting, I received the news that the child actor who played the character of ''Pixote'' was shot dead in the street. After this incident, I was more determined to make ''Salaam Bombay!'', and decided to share the film's dividends with street children if we could.\"{{r|Shah}} After making four [[documentaries]],{{r|AtKisson}} ''Salaam Bombay!'' was Nair's first full-length [[feature film]].{{r|Manik}}\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Krishna & Sola Saal in Salaam Bombay! (1988).jpg|thumb|Krishna and Sola Saal in ''Salaam Bombay!'']]\n\nMost of the film ''Salaam Bombay!'' was shot on Falkland Road, a [[red light district]] in [[Kamathipura]], Bombay.{{r|Kulkarni}}  The child actors in the film were real street children. The cast received drama training at a workshop in Bombay before they appeared in the film. A room was rented near the [[Grant Road railway station]] for rehearsals, where about 130 children rehearsed on the first day.{{r|Rahman}} Later, before appearing in the film, a group of 24 street children trained in a workshop, where they were given music, dance and acting training. Gradually the stories of the city of Bombay, their parents, sex, trafficking, drug dealing, gangs and their profiteering were learned from them.{{r|Rahman}} They were reunited with their families even before the film was shot.{{r|Shah}} They were paid to pay for their medical treatment and work on the film, and some of that money was left as a fixed deposit.{{r|Rahman}} [[Irrfan Khan]] played the role of a letter writer in a two-minute scene in the film, which was his first appearance in a film.{{r|HT}}\n\nAfter its release, director Nair established an organization called the [[Salaam Baalak Trust]] in 1989 to rehabilitate the children who appeared in the film.{{r|giveworld}} Dinaz Stafford, a child psychologist, worked with the children after the film.{{r|Rahman}} The Salaam Baalak Trust now lends support to street children in Bombay, [[Delhi]] and [[Bhubaneshwar]]. Shafiq Sayed, who played Krishna in the film, is currently living as an [[auto rickshaw]] driver in Bangalore.{{r|Seethalakshmi}}\n\nInitially, Cadrage, [[Film4 Productions|Channel Four Films]], [[Doordarshan]], [[La Sept|La Sept Cin\u00e9ma]], [[Mirabai Films]] and the [[National Film Development Corporation of India]] paid for the production of the film.{{sfn|Foster|1997|pp=119}}{{sfn|Arunachalam|2020|pp=1063}} Several producers co-produced the film with Nair, with Gabriel Auer from France as the executive producer, [[Michael Nozik]] from the UK and Anil Tejani from India and Cherry Rogers as the co-executive producers.
