Starring [[Bill Pullman]] as \"the world's most private detective\", Daryl Zero, and [[Ben Stiller]] as his assistant Steve Arlo, the film's plot is loosely based on the [[Arthur Conan Doyle]] short story \"[[A Scandal in Bohemia]]\".<ref name=\"AV Club Tobias\">{{cite news |last1=Tobias |first1=Scott |title=Zero Effect |url=https://www.avclub.com/zero-effect-1798218746 |access-date=August 8, 2021 |work=The AV Club |date=January 14, 2010}}</ref>\n\nShot in [[Portland, Oregon]]<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.oregonlive.com/movies/2014/06/oregons_hidden_indie-film_gems.html|title=Angelina, Keanu and other big stars came to Portland to film these 5 under-the-radar indie movies|last=Mohan|first=Marc|work=[[The Oregonian]]|date=2014-06-04|access-date=2016-07-08}}</ref> and scored by [[The Greyboy Allstars]], the film was screened in the [[Un Certain Regard]] section at the [[1998 Cannes Film Festival]].<ref name=\"festival-cannes.com\">{{cite web |url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/10309/year/1998.html |title=Festival de Cannes: Zero Effect |access-date=2009-10-04|work=festival-cannes.com}}</ref>\n\nThe film did not perform well at the box-office grossing $2 million with a budget of $5 million.\n\n==Plot==\nDaryl Zero is the world's greatest detective, but is also a socially maladroit [[misanthrope]]. Among his quirks is that he never meets or has direct contact with his clients, instead conducting business through his assistant, Steve Arlo. Throughout the movie, Zero provides narration as he reads lines from his proposed autobiography.\n\nZero and Arlo are hired by Portland area millionaire Gregory Stark, who has lost the key to a safe deposit box and is being blackmailed by an unknown person who forces him to follow elaborate instructions to deliver the cash payments. Zero quickly discovers that the blackmailer is Gloria Sullivan, an [[Emergency medical technician|EMT]] with a mysterious past. Zero becomes attracted to Gloria and they sleep together, compromising his trademark objectivity. He lets his guard down and tells her that his [[child abuse|abusive]] father killed his mother and himself.\n\nStark pressures Arlo to reveal the blackmailer's identity so that he can have that person killed. Arlo must also deal with Zero's absurd demands on his time, which increasingly interfere with Arlo's relationship with his girlfriend Jess.\n\nZero eventually discovers that Stark had raped Gloria's mother after she broke up with him. She later blackmailed Stark with the threat of exposing him as a rapist, so he had her killed. However, she had already given birth to their daughter Gloria, who was discovered and raised by the hitman who killed her mother. Gloria grew up knowing that Stark was behind her mother's murder, and when her adoptive father (the hitman) contracted a terminal illness, she used the information to  blackmail Stark, using the money to pay for medical treatment.\n\nAt the meeting to deliver the final blackmail payment, Stark collapses from a heart attack and Gloria is compelled to save his life. She then flees the country with Zero's assistance.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Bill Pullman]] as Daryl Zero\n* [[Ben Stiller]] as Steve Arlo\n* [[Ryan O'Neal]] as Gregory Stark\n* [[Kim Dickens]] as Gloria Sullivan\n* [[Angela Featherstone]] as Jess\n\n==Soundtrack==\nReleased in January 1998 on [[Work Group]], the official soundtrack for the film includes:\n\n# \"Mystery Dance\" \u2013 [[Elvis Costello]]\n# \"One Dance\" \u2013 [[Dan Bern]]\n# \"Starbucked\" \u2013 Bond\n# \"[[Into My Arms]]\" \u2013 [[Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds]]\n# \"Some Jingle Jangle Morning\" \u2013 [[Mary Lou Lord]]\n# \"Emma J\" \u2013 [[Brendan Benson]]\n# \"The Method Pt. 2\" \u2013 [[The Greyboy Allstars]]\n# \"Drifting Along\" \u2013 [[Jamiroquai]]\n# \"Till You Die\" \u2013 Candy Butchers\n# \"Lounge\" \u2013 [[Esthero]]\n# \"Blackmail Drop\" \u2013 [[The Greyboy Allstars]]\n# \"Three Days\" \u2013 Thermadore\n# \"Rest My Head Against the Wall\" \u2013 [[Heatmiser]]\n# \"The Zero Effect\" \u2013 [[The Greyboy Allstars]]\n\n==Reception==\n[[Rotten Tomatoes]], a [[review aggregator]], reports that 65% of 51 surveyed critics gave the film a positive review; the average rating is 6.67/10.
