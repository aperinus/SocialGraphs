It was directed by [[George Armitage]] and based on the 1969 [[The Big Bounce (novel)|novel of the same name]] by [[Elmore Leonard]]. Leonard's novel had previously been adapted for the big screen in a 1969 [[The Big Bounce (1969 film)|film of the same name]] directed by Alex March and starring [[Ryan O'Neal]].\n\n==Plot==\nJack Ryan, a [[Surfing|surfer]] and small-time thief, has a fight with the intimidating Lou Harris, involving a baseball bat. Harris is a [[Construction foreman|foreman]] on a [[Hawaii]] construction site run by duplicitous millionaire Ray Ritchie. When Jack is released from jail, both the police and Ritchie's business partner, Bob Rogers Jr., tell Jack to leave the island.  However, Judge Walter Crewes takes a liking to Jack and offers him a place to stay and a job as a [[handyman]] at a small resort of beach-front bungalows that the Judge owns. Jack has treacherous encounters with Harris and Rogers Jr., on numerous occasions.\n\nRitchie has all his (substantial) property registered in the name of his wife, Alison. He is also cheating on his wife with a much younger mistress, Nancy Hayes.  When Nancy takes an interest in Jack, the Judge warns him that she likes \"the criminal type\" and cannot be trusted. Jack is falling for Nancy, and the two break into houses for fun and profit.\n\nNancy suggests to Jack a scheme to steal $200,000 that Ritchie keeps for bribes and mob business.  She arranges for Jack to sneak into Ritchie's house to steal the money from his safe. Jack arrives to find that Nancy has poisoned Ritchie, in a conspiracy with Alison.  Nancy has [[frame-up|set up]] Jack to be Ritchie's \"killer\", with Alison to shoot him dead as an intruder. It is revealed that Judge Crewes is Alison's lover and has been part of the conspiracy, with the two promising to give Nancy the $200,000 for her part. Jack manages to steal the money from the safe and narrowly escapes, leaving Alison and Crewes to frame Nancy as Ritchie's killer.\n\nAlison and Crewes are seen sailing Ritchie's yacht, disposing of his body in the ocean.  Nancy is seen in disguise, trying to escape the island before she is arrested for Ritchie's murder.  Jack drives past Nancy in a limousine, stopping to wish her well and refusing to help her after her attempt to frame him. He departs with the money and a beautiful vacationer named Number 9 he met while working at Judge Crewe's resort.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Owen Wilson]] as Jack Ryan\n* [[Morgan Freeman]] as Walter Crewes\n* [[Charlie Sheen]] as Bob Rogers Jr.\n* [[Sara Foster]] as Nancy Hayes\n* [[Vinnie Jones]] as Lou Harris\n* [[Gary Sinise]] as Ray Ritchie\n* [[Bebe Neuwirth]] as Alison Ritchie\n* Anahit Minasyan as Number 9\n* [[Willie Nelson]] as Joe\n* [[Harry Dean Stanton]] as Bob Rogers Sr.\n* [[Wendy Thorlakson]] as Wendy the party planner \n* [[Kala Alexander]] as himself\n\n==Production==\nGeorge Armitage was given a copy of Sebastian Gutirrez's script by [[Steve Bing]].\n<blockquote>''The Big Bounce'', the book, when you break it down, is basically an act and a half. It's not a real three acts. So you're going to have to add half of the picture. So right away you're in trouble with somebody like Elmore, who I considered to be an absolutely brilliant writer. So he worked on the script with me, he gave me notes, and the notes are classic, they're great.<ref name=\"filmcomment\" /></blockquote>\n\nThe setting for the film was moved from the [[Michigan Thumb|Thumb area of Michigan]], where the novel was set,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.elmoreleonard.com/index.php?/novels/the_big_bounce|title=The Big Bounce|website=elmoreleonard.com|access-date=July 22, 2021}}</ref> to the [[North Shore of Oahu]]. The film was shot on location in Hawaii.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://the.honoluluadvertiser.com/article/2004/Jan/30/en/en01a.html |title=Hawai'i plays itself in 'The Big Bounce' |last=Harada |first=Wayne |newspaper=[[Honolulu Advertiser]] |date=January 30, 2004 |access-date=April 7, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150302162210/http://the.honoluluadvertiser.com/article/2004/Jan/30/en/en01a.html |archive-date=March 2, 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nOn the first day of pre production, Armitage was hit in the eye with a piece of lava rock and contracted a virus. The director came down with an infection with two weeks left to shoot and had to go to the hospital. Production shut down but Armitage says \"Fortunately it was right at Christmas, so it turned into a Christmas break that we hadn't planned on, and I completed the picture afterwards.\"<ref name=\"filmcomment\" />\n\nArmitage says that despite this the film was very pleasant. \"Now, being in Hawaii was probably a great deal of that. But it was just an extraordinary experience, and I credit the producer, Steve Bing, with that. He put up his own money, and I think he had $250,000 in bar bills, just picking up drinks for the crew and cast for all that time. So he couldn't have been more wonderful.\"<ref name=\"filmcomment\">{{cite web |date=April 28, 2015 |author=Nick Pinkerton |url=https://www.filmcomment.com/blog/interview-george-armitage/ |title=Interview with George Armitage |work=Film Comment |access-date=July 22, 2021 }}</ref>\n\n===Post Production===\nArmitage says the film encountered troubles in post production when Steve Bing suffered a crisis of conscience:\n<blockquote>He was getting advice from people who're in the money business, and he felt that to have a chance to get his money back, he should go PG-13. It was very difficult for some people to understand that when you take away the reality of these people, the way they speak, what they do\u2014these are important elements of the movie that make it work. Whether they would've made it a financial success I don't know, but they make the movie work, and if the movie works, you have more of a chance of more people seeing it.... The first time we showed the film, it came in at an NC-17 instead of an R. And it was unreleasable in that form. So I said: \"We'll make it an R\". ''Grosse Pointe Blank'' was an R, we made it for $7 million and it probably made $45 million lifetime, all in. But they said: \"You can't make an R-rated comedy, they don't make money\". That's what they were saying in 2004. Since then, of course, a lot of R-rated comedies have done beautifully. So I said: \u201cLook, I'm not going to oversee the destruction of my own movie, there's no way. If you go to a PG-13, you're going to eliminate Elmore Leonard from this movie\". The language, there's some incredible love scenes\u2026 But the decision was made\u2014they felt that they had to do that, so I said: \"Goodbye\". I left the picture after my second cut. We'd already had two very, very good previews: in the 80s, up to the 90s. I don't think I've even looked at the release print. A lot of the cuts were language and nudity. Owen and Sarah were good sports, very generous with themselves. But when people ask to see my last movie, I show them my cut of The Big Bounce, I don't show them what's out there. It isn't absolutely complete, but I think it could have been a far, far better film.<ref name=\"filmcomment\" /></blockquote>{{Long quote|date=September 2021}}\n\n==Reception==\nOn [[Rotten Tomatoes]] the film has an approval rating of 16% based on 135 reviews, with an average score of 4.20/10.
