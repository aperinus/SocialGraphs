'''''Farewell to the Master''''' and '''''Journey to the World''''') is a 1951 American [[science fiction film]] from [[20th Century Fox]], produced by [[Julian Blaustein]] and directed by [[Robert Wise]]. It stars [[Michael Rennie]], [[Patricia Neal]], [[Hugh Marlowe]], [[Sam Jaffe]], [[Billy Gray (actor)|Billy Gray]], [[Frances Bavier]] and [[Lock Martin]]. The screenplay was written by [[Edmund H. North]], based on the 1940 science fiction short story \"[[Farewell to the Master]]\" by [[Harry Bates (author)|Harry Bates]], and the film score was composed by [[Bernard Herrmann]].<ref name=\"Gianos p. 23\">Gianos 1998 p. 23.</ref>\n\nSet in the [[Cold War]] during the early stages of the [[nuclear arms race]], the storyline involves a [[humanoid]] alien visitor who comes to Earth, accompanied by a powerful robot, to deliver an important message that will affect the entire human race.\n\nIn 1995, the film was selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] as \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0043456/awards \"'The Day the Earth Stood Still': Award Wins and Nominations.\"] ''[[IMDb|IMDb.com]]''.

A humanoid emerges and announces that he comes \"in peace and with good will.\" When he unexpectedly opens a small device, he is shot and wounded by a nervous soldier. A tall robot emerges from the saucer and quickly disintegrates the Army's weapons. The alien orders the robot, [[Gort (The Day the Earth Stood Still)|Gort]], to desist. He explains that the now-broken device was a gift for the [[President of the United States]] that would have enabled him \"to study life on the other planets\".\n\nThe alien, [[Klaatu (The Day the Earth Stood Still)|Klaatu]], is taken to [[Walter Reed Army Hospital]]. After surgery, he uses a salve to quickly heal his wound. Meanwhile, the Army fails to enter the saucer because Gort stands outside, silent and unmoving.\n\nKlaatu tells the President's secretary, Mr. Harley, that he has a message that must be delivered to all the world's leaders simultaneously. Harley tells him that in the current world situation this is impossible. Klaatu proposes to spend time among ordinary humans to better understand their \"unreasoning suspicions and attitudes\". Harley rejects the proposal and Klaatu is kept under guard.\n\nKlaatu is able to escape and moves into a boarding house, using the name Mr. Carpenter (\"Maj. John Carpenter\") on the dry cleaner's tag on a suit he acquired. Among the residents are young widow Helen Benson and her son Bobby. Klaatu becomes a mentor to Bobby. Helen's suitor, Tom Stevens, becomes jealous of the stranger.\n\nThe boy takes Klaatu on a tour of the city, including a visit to his father's grave in [[Arlington National Cemetery]]; Klaatu learns that most of the dead are soldiers killed in wars. They also visit the [[Lincoln Memorial]]. Klaatu asks Bobby, \"Who is the greatest living person?\" Bobby suggests Professor Barnhardt. They visit his home, but he is out; Klaatu is able to enter. Barnhardt's blackboard is covered with equations (attempting to find a solution to the [[Three Body Problem]]). Klaatu adds to them and, after being discovered by the housekeeper, leaves his contact information.\n\nThat evening, a government agent escorts Klaatu to Barnhardt. Klaatu tells Barnhardt that the people of other planets are concerned about Earth's possible aggression, now that humanity has developed rockets and rudimentary [[atomic power]]. He states that if his message is ignored, Earth could be \"eliminated\". Barnhardt agrees to gather scientists from around the world at the saucer; he also suggests that Klaatu demonstrate his power peacefully beforehand.\n\nKlaatu returns to his spaceship, unaware that Bobby is following him. Bobby watches as Gort knocks out two guards to help Klaatu reenter the saucer. Bobby runs home and tells Helen. She does not believe him, but Tom is suspicious.\n\nThe next day, for half an hour, starting at 12-noon (east coast time), all electrical equipment on Earth ceases to operate, except for essential services, such as hospitals and aircraft in flight.\n\nKlaatu learns that Bobby watched him the previous night. He visits Helen at work, reveals his purpose on Earth, and asks that she not betray him. Helen asks Tom to keep Klaatu's identity secret, but, already in the process of alerting the military, he refuses to listen.\n\nHelen and Klaatu rush to Barnhardt's home. They hope that Barnhardt can hide Klaatu until the meeting later that evening. Klaatu tells Helen that if anything should happen to him, she must go to Gort and say, \"[[Klaatu barada nikto]]\".\n\nThe Army tracks them in their taxi. Klaatu is shot dead, and his body is taken to a nearby police station cell. Helen rushes to the saucer and speaks the phrase. Hearing Klaatu's words, Gort retrieves Klaatu's body, and revives him, though Klaatu tells Helen that his revival is only temporary.\n\nKlaatu tells Barnhardt's assembled scientists that an interplanetary organization has created a police force of invincible robots like Gort. \"In matters of aggression, we have given them absolute power over us.\" Klaatu concludes, \"Your choice is simple: join us and live in [[peace]], or pursue your present course and face obliteration. We shall be waiting for your answer.\" Klaatu and Gort depart in the saucer.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Michael Rennie]] as [[Klaatu (The Day the Earth Stood Still)|Klaatu]]\n* [[Patricia Neal]] as Helen Benson{{efn|Patricia Neal, who played Helen Benson, was only 12 years older than Billy Gray, who played her son.}}\n* [[Hugh Marlowe]] as Tom Stevens\n* [[Sam Jaffe]] as Professor Jacob Barnhardt{{efn|Actor Sam Jaffe, who played Professor Barnhardt, had an engineering degree and taught mathematics before turning to acting.<ref>Flint, Peter B.

His previous actions are misunderstood, and he eventually is killed by military authority. At the end of the film, Klaatu, having risen from the dead, ascends into the (night) sky. Other parallels include: his coming to Earth with a message for all mankind; his befriending of a child; possessing wisdom and specialized scientific knowledge beyond any human being; and people being given a sign of his power.

He reviewed more than two hundred science fiction short stories and novels in search of a storyline that could be used because this film genre was well suited for a metaphorical discussion of such grave issues. Studio head [[Darryl F. Zanuck]] gave the go-ahead for this project, and Blaustein hired Edmund North to write the screenplay based on elements from Harry Bates's 1940 short story \"[[Farewell to the Master]].\" The revised final screenplay was completed on February 21, 1951.

Not accustomed to a confining, heat-inducing costume, he worked carefully while wearing the two oversized, laced up, foamed [[neoprene]] suits for the illusion of a seamless metallic Gort. Wise decided Martin's on-screen shooting time would be limited to half-hour intervals, so Martin, with his generally weak constitution, would face no more than minor discomfort. These segments, in turn, were then edited together into the film's final print.<ref name=\"Warren\">Warren 1982, p. 621.</ref>\n\nIn a commentary track on DVD, interviewed by fellow director [[Nicholas Meyer]], Wise said he wanted the film to appear as realistic and believable as possible, to push the core message against armed conflict in the real world.

Herrmann chose unusual instrumentation for the film: violin, cello, and bass (all three electric), two [[theremin]] electronic instruments (played by Dr. [[Samuel Hoffman]] and Paul Shure), two [[Hammond organ]]s, Fox studio's Wurlitzer organ, three [[vibraphone]]s, two [[glockenspiel]]s, marimba, tam-tam, two bass drums, three sets of timpani, two pianos, celesta, two harps, one horn, three trumpets, three trombones, and four tubas.<ref>Wrobel, Bill.

''The Day the Earth Stood Still''</ref> and Frederick S. Clarke of ''[[Cinefantastique]]'' called it in 1970 \"the most famous phrase ever spoken by an extraterrestrial\".<ref>Clarke, Frederick S. ''[[Cinefantastique]]'', 1970, p. 2.</ref>\n\nPatricia Neal had a problem speaking the phrase, though she was proud of the film overall. \"I do think it's the best science fiction film ever made, although I admit that I sometimes had a difficult time keeping a straight face. Michael would patiently watch me bite my lips to avoid giggling and ask, with true British reserve, 'Is that the way you intend to play it?'\"<ref>Neal, Patricia. ''As I Am: An Autobiography''. {{ISBN|9781451626001}}</ref>\n\n[[Edmund H. North]], who wrote ''The Day the Earth Stood Still'', also created the [[alien language]] used in the film, including the iconic phrase \"Klaatu barada nikto\". The official spelling for the phrase comes directly from the script and provides insight as to its proper pronunciation. No translation was given in the film. Philosophy professor Aeon J. Skoble speculates the famous phrase is a \"safe-word\" which is part of a [[fail-safe]] feature used during diplomatic missions such as the one Klaatu and Gort make to Earth. With the use of the safe-word, Gort's deadly force can be deactivated in the event the robot is mistakenly triggered into a defensive posture. Skoble observes that the theme has evolved into a \"staple of science fiction that the machines charged with protecting us from ourselves will misuse or abuse their power.\"<ref>Skoble 2007, p. 91.</ref>\n\n''[[Fantastic Films]]'' explored the meaning of \"Klaatu barada nikto\" in a 1978 article titled \"The Language of Klaatu.\" The article, written by Tauna Le Marbe, who is listed as its \"alien linguistics editor\", attempts to translate all the alien words Klaatu used throughout the film.<ref name=\"fantastic-films\">Le Marbe, Tauna.

[[Robert Wise]], the director of the film, conveyed an account of Edmund North telling him, \"Well, it's just something I kind of cooked up.
