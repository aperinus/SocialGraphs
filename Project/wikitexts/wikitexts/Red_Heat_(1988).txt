Finding themselves on the same case, Danko and Ridzik work as partners to catch a cunning and deadly [[Georgia (country)|Georgian]] [[drug lord|drug kingpin]], Viktor Rostavili ([[Ed O'Ross]]), who killed Danko's previous partner in [[the Soviet Union]].\n\nMost of the scenes set in the [[Soviet Union]] were actually shot in [[Hungary]]. Schwarzenegger was paid a salary of $8&nbsp;million for his role in the film.<ref name=\"8RH\">{{cite news |last=Harmetz |first=Aljean |title=Big Hollywood Salaries a Magnet for the Stars (And the Public)|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=July 25, 1988 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/07/25/movies/big-hollywood-salaries-a-magnet-for-the-stars-and-the-public.html |access-date=February 1, 2020 }}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nCaptain Ivan Danko and Lieutenant Yuri Ogarkov of the [[Moscow City Police|Moscow Militia]] lead a [[sting operation]] against [[Georgian mafia|Georgian]] drug kingpin Viktor Rostavili. However, Rostavili manages to evade capture, and in an ensuing firefight, kills Ogarkov and flees to the [[United States]]. As Danko is recovering from his injuries, Rostavili is arrested for a minor traffic violation in [[Chicago]], and Danko is subsequently dispatched to America to retrieve the felon, under strict orders not to reveal the true nature of Rostavili's extradition.\n\nUpon arriving in Chicago, Danko is met by Police Detective Sergeant Art Ridzik and Detective Max Gallagher. As he is interrogating Rostavili, Danko confiscates a mysterious key hidden on his person. While he is being transported to the airport, the group is ambushed by his men and Gallagher is shot and killed, allowing the prisoner to escape. Against the wishes of local authorities, Danko resolves to remain in Chicago to apprehend Rostavili, and Ridzik is assigned to be his [[minder]].\n\nThrough an informant, Danko and Ridzik learn that Rostavili is working with local [[Gang|street gangs]] to purchase and smuggle uncut [[cocaine]] into the [[Soviet Union]]. The duo confront Rostavili's American wife Cat Manzetti, but are led into an ambush where Rostavili demands Danko return his key, forcing the two to flee.\n\nDanko and Ridzik go to a hospital to interrogate one of Rostavili's men, injured during the earlier ambush, but he is killed by another of Rostavili's accomplices disguised as a nurse. Danko subsequently shoots and kills the assassin. Ridzik's superiors confiscate Danko's [[Sidearm (weapon)|sidearm]], as he isn't licensed to carry one in the United States, and order him to cease the investigation. However Ridzik, who still wants to avenge his partner's murder, secretly gives Ivan his spare gun.\n\nReturning to his hotel, Danko is attacked by Rostavili's men. While Danko fights them off, Rostavili sneaks into his room and steals the key. Ridzik takes Danko to visit a locksmith, where they match the key to ones produced for lockers at a bus terminal. Rostavili uses the key to retrieve his drug shipment, and steals an empty bus just as Danko and Ridzik arrive. Chasing him in another bus, Danko and Ridzik cause Rostavili to crash into an oncoming train. As Rostavili crawls out of the wreckage, Danko kills him. Later, Ridzik takes Danko to the airport. As a token of their new friendship, they exchange [[Watch|wristwatches]].\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] as Captain Ivan Danko\n* [[Jim Belushi|James Belushi]] as Detective Sergeant Art Ridzik\n* [[Peter Boyle]] as Commander Lou Donnelly\n* [[Ed O'Ross]] as Viktor Rostavili / Viktor Rosta\n* [[Laurence Fishburne|Larry Fishburne]] as Lieutenant Charlie Stobbs\n* [[Gina Gershon]] as Catherine \"Cat\" Manzetti\n* [[Richard Bright (actor)|Richard Bright]] as Sergeant Max Gallagher\n* J.

He says he conceived of the idea for ''Red Heat'' because he and Arnold Schwarzenegger had long wanted to work together:\n<blockquote>I didn't want to do sci-fi and it's tough to use Arnold credibly in an American context with his accent. I thought it would be interesting if he could play a Russian cop in the US. I wanted to do a traditional John Wayne/Clint Eastwood larger-than-life movie. You then ask the question: Will the American audience accept an unapologetic Soviet hero, someone who will not defect at the end of the movie?<ref name=\"hill\">{{cite news |title=Director Hill puts extra dimension in Hollywood themes |last=Thompson     |first=Anne |newspaper= Chicago Tribune |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1988-06-17/entertainment/8801080456_1_howard-hawks-movies-genre-films |date=17 June 1988 |page= GL}}</ref></blockquote>\nAccording to Schwarzenegger, when Hill approached him he did not have a complete script \u2013 he just had the basic premise and the scene in which Danko rips off a henchman's leg to discover it is wooden and contains cocaine. Schwarzenegger agreed to make the movie on the basis of this and Hill's track record, in particular his earlier buddy action comedy ''48 Hours''.<ref name=\"arnie\">{{cite book|first=Arnold|last=Schwarzenegger|title=Total Recall: My Unbelievably True Life Story|page=341|year=2012|publisher=Simon & Schuster}}</ref>\n\nThe wooden leg scene originally came from a script by Harry Kleiner that had been sent to Hill. Hill did not want to do the script but loved the scene and paid Kleiner for it. \"I think it's the best scene in the movie\", said Hill later. \"The movie, after he left Moscow, I never thought was much good, but I thought that was a terrific scene.\"<ref name=\"tough\">{{cite web|url=https://filmmakermagazine.com/64222-tough-little-stories-director-walter-hill-at-92y-tribeca/#.W2alhRN97OQ|website=Filmmaker Magazine|date=January 29, 2013|title=\"Tough Little Stories\": Director Walter Hill at 92Y Tribeca}}</ref>\n\nHill says he deliberately chose to tone down the Schwarzenegger persona, making him more realistic and less prone to wisecracks. Hill:\n<blockquote>I had confidence in him as an actor. I didn't want him just to throw a Volkswagen over a building. Arnold has an ability to communicate that cuts through cultures and countries. They just love to see this guy win. But everyone thinks it's his muscles. It's not that at all: it's his face, his eyes. He has a face that's a throwback to a warrior from the Middle Ages or ancient Greece.<ref name=\"hill\"/></blockquote>\nSchwarzenegger says Hill told him to watch [[Greta Garbo]]'s performance in ''[[Ninotchka]]'' (1939) \"to get a handle on how Danko [his character] should react as a loyal Soviet in the West. I got to learn a little Russian, and it was a role for which my own accent was a plus.\"<ref name=\"arnie\"/>\n\nThe music score was done by James Horner. \"I told James I wanted something like you're in the Olympics and you've just won a gold medal\", said Hill. \"I wanted something heroic.\"<ref name=\"sam\">{{cite news|title=Action man with an eye for character|author=Dwyer, Michael|work=The Irish Times|date=January 13, 1989|page=14}}</ref> The second movement (\"Philosophers\") of [[Sergei Prokofiev]]'s ''[[Cantata for the 20th Anniversary of the October Revolution (Prokofiev)|Cantata for the 20th Anniversary of the October Revolution]]'' was used in the opening and closing titles of the film.\n\nHill says he wanted to use buses rather than cars in the climactic action scene because it would be more interesting. \"Also, I thought it was very appropriate for Arnold. He doesn't fit well in cars.\"<ref name=\"sam\"/>\n\nHe described the film as \"in an odd way, it's a traditional love story between these two guys\".<ref name=\"sam\"/>\n\n[[File:Red Heat title sample.png|thumb|Arnold Schwarzenegger's name in the pseudo-Russian font adopted for the titles of ''Red Heat'']]\nThe script was constantly rewritten during the shoot. Among the writers who worked on it were Hill himself, Harry Kleiner, Troy Kennedy Martin, Steven Meerson & Peter Krikes, and John Mankiewicz & Daniel Pyne. \"You've got to understand that Walter likes to create as he goes along\", said a source close to the production. \"Also, the project was put together quickly based on an idea of his-a Russian cop in Chicago. There was no script.\" A spokesman for the Writers Guild said Hill was a member in very good standing: \"He does tend to hire a lot of people but he pays well above minimums and we feel he's been quite straightforward about screen credit.\"<ref>{{cite news|title=WORK IN PROGRESS|last=Klady|first= Leonard|newspaper= Los Angeles Times|date=October 25, 1987|page= 36}}</ref>\n\n[[Film title design]]er [[Wayne Fitzgerald]] created a new font for the film, a morph of English and Russian alphabets. For example, he removed the bar in \"A\" so that it imitates the Russian \u041b (\u039b), and flipped letters N and R, so that they coincide with Russian \u0418 and \u042f, respectively.\n\n===Filming===\nThe first half of the opening scene was shot in [[Budapest]]'s Rudas Thermal Bath. It features a brawl between naked men, including Schwarzenegger. He approved the scene saying that \"Whenever the scene calls for nudity and it fits into the movie, I don't mind that .. But if it is exploiting the whole idea and is thrown in for no reason, then it bothers me and I stay away from it.\"<ref>Thomas, Bob (July 14, 1988) [https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1988-07-14-ca-8641-story.html Schwarzenegger Bares Most in Near-Nude Fight Scene].

Despite obtaining permission to film in Moscow, the film crew was unsure about exactly where they could shoot; hence many \"Moscow\" scenes were eventually filmed in Budapest.

Hill wanted it to be an unusually large and threatening weapon resembling [[Walther P38]]. Tim LaFrance designed the gun at his workshop in San Diego, starting from [[Desert Eagle]] as an inspiration; hence the gun was nicknamed the \"Hollywood Eagle\". After release of the movie, its copies were sold in the United States as \"Pobyrin pistol\".<ref>[https://americanhandgunner.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/HMJ88.pdf \"Hollywood Eagle\"].
