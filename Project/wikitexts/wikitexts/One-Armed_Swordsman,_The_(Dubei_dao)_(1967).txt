It was the first Hong Kong film to make HK$1 million at the local box office, propelling its star [[Jimmy Wang Yu|Jimmy Wang]] to super stardom.\n\nThis film eventually became the first in the ''One-Armed Swordsman'' trilogy. A sequel was released in 1969 called ''[[Return of the One-Armed Swordsman]]'', followed by ''[[The New One-Armed Swordsman]]'' in 1971, all directed by [[Chang Cheh]]. It has since achieved classic status in [[cinema of Hong Kong|Hong Kong cinema]]. In the [[Hong Kong Film Award]]'s [[Hong Kong Film Award#Best 100 Chinese Motion Pictures|2005 poll]], ''One-Armed Swordsman'' was voted as the 15th best Chinese-language film.\n\n==Plot==\nThe Golden Sword school is attacked by bandits. The servant Fang Cheng sacrifices his life to protect his master Qi Ru Feng. In gratitude, Qi accepts the dying Fang Cheng's son, Fang Kang, as his student. Years later, Fang Kang is scorned by his snobbish fellow students because of his poor background. Deciding that he will only cause trouble for his master, Fang Kang leaves the school only to run into his classmates and his master's spoiled daughter, Pei Er. In the ensuing fight Fang's right arm is cut off by Pei Er, who is angry at his indifference towards her. Stumbling away, Fang falls off a bridge into the passing boat of a peasant girl Xiao Man.\n\nXiao Man nurses him back to health and the two fall in love. Fang Kang is nevertheless depressed as he is unable to practice his swordsmanship. Reluctantly, Xiao Man gives him a half-burnt kung-fu manual which she had inherited from her now dead parents. With its help, Fang Kang is able to master a new one-armed style of swordplay, making him stronger than before.\n\nMeanwhile, master Qi Ru Feng is preparing for his 55th birthday and has invited all of his students to the celebration to choose a successor from amongst them so that he can retire from the martial arts world. However, his old enemies the Long-armed Devil and the Smiling Tiger Cheng are taking the opportunity to destroy Qi Ru Feng. Using a specially designed \"sword-lock\", they ambush and kill Qi's students travelling to the celebration.\n\nFang Kang inadvertently learns of the plot and, breaking his promise to Xiao Man not to involve himself in the martial arts world, rushes to save his master. He is delayed en route by the Long-Armed Devil's accomplices, and when he arrives the Long-Armed Devil has already killed most of the students and wounded Qi Ru Feng. In a vicious battle, Fang Kang manages to kill the Long-Armed Devil, but chooses to return to Xiao Man and become a farmer instead of taking his master's place at the school.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Jimmy Wang Yu|Jimmy Wang]] as Fang Kang\n*[[Lisa Chiao Chiao]] as Xiao Man\n*[[Tien Feng]] as Qi Ru Feng\n*[[Angela Pan]] as Qi Pei Er\n*Yeung Chi-hing as Long Armed Devil\n*Tang Ti as Smiling Tiger Cheng Tian Shou\n*Fan Mei-sheng as Guo Sheng / Brother Hua\n*Wong Sai-git as Qin Da Chuan\n*Cheung Pooi-saan as Sun Hao\n*Fan Dan as Feng's rich disciple\n*[[Ku Feng]] as Fang Chang\n*[[Chen Yen-yen]] as Feng's wife\n\n==Reception==\nThe film's box office success earned Chang Cheh the epithet \"One Million Dollar Director\",<ref name=\"hkfa\" /> established Jimmy Wang Yu as a star, and helped to secure the popularity of the [[Shaw Brothers Studio]] and martial arts cinema.\n\nThe modern reception of the film in Hong Kong and [[Taiwan]] is positive.<ref name=\"goldenhorselist\">{{cite web|url=http://www.filmbiz.asia/news/horse-announces-greatest-chinese-films|publisher=[[Film Business Asia]]|access-date=November 4, 2015|date=January 27, 2011|title=Horse announces greatest Chinese films|last=Cremin|first=Stephen|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110314212536/http://www.filmbiz.asia/news/horse-announces-greatest-chinese-films|archive-date=14 March 2011 }}</ref><ref name=\"hkfaa\">{{cite web|url=http://www.hkfaa.com/news/100films.html|publisher=[[Hong Kong Film Awards]]|title=[\u6700\u4f73\u83ef\u8a9e\u7247\u4e00\u767e\u90e8] The Best 100 Chinese Motion Pictures|language=zh|access-date=June 14, 2016}}</ref> At the 24th [[Hong Kong Film Awards]] various Asian film critics, film makers and actors voted for the top Chinese films from Hong Kong, [[Taiwan]] and China.<ref name=\"hkfaa\" /> ''One-Armed Swordsman'' was listed at 15th place on the list.<ref name=\"hkfaa\" /> In 2011, the [[Golden Horse Film Festival and Awards|Tapei Golden Horse Film Festival]] had 122 industry professionals take part in the survey.<ref name=\"goldenhorselist\" /> The voters included film scholars, festival programmers, film directors, actors and producers to vote for the 100 Greatest Chinese-Language Films.<ref name=\"goldenhorselist\" /> ''One-Armed Swordsman'' was listed at 73rd place on the list.<ref name=\"goldenhorselist\" />\n\n==Legacy==\n[[Chang Cheh]] directed a sequel in 1969, ''[[Return of the One-Armed Swordsman]]'', which was also produced by the [[Shaw Brothers Studio]] with [[Jimmy Wang Yu|Jimmy Wang]] reprising his role as Fang Kang (or Fang Gang). In 1971, Cheh made a third one-armed swordsman film for Shaw Brothers, ''[[The New One-Armed Swordsman]]'', starring [[David Chiang]] as a different one-armed swordsman.\n\nThe popularity of these films led to imitations by other studios and Jimmy Wang playing similar one-armed characters on several occasions, beginning with the Japanese film ''[[Zatoichi and the One-Armed Swordsman]]'' in 1971, in which he was paired with the blind swordsman [[Zatoichi]] ([[Shintaro Katsu]]). Also in 1971, Wang directed and starred in ''[[One-Armed Boxer]]'', combining elements of the ''One-Armed Swordsman'' and ''[[The Chinese Boxer]]'' films he had previously made with Shaw Brothers. In 1976 he appeared in three other films with this trope: ''[[Master of the Flying Guillotine]]'' (a sequel to ''One-Armed Boxer''), ''[[One-Armed Swordsman Against Nine Killers]]'' and ''[[One-Armed Swordsmen]]'', which starred and was co-directed by Jimmy Wang and David Chiang, playing rival one-armed swordsmen.\n\nIn 1995, director and producer [[Tsui Hark]] created ''[[The Blade (film)|The Blade]]'', an original story about a one-armed fighter inspired by the one-armed swordsman films of the 1960s and 70s.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{IMDb title|0061597}}\n*{{Allmovie title|36346}}\n*{{hkmdb title|4705}}\n*{{Rotten-tomatoes|id=onearmed_swordsman|title=One-Armed Swordsman}}\n*[https://archive.today/20130127174535/http://www.kungfucinema.com/?p=581 Review at Kung Fu Cinema]\n\n{{Chang Cheh}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:One-Armed Swordsman}}\n[[Category:1967 films]]\n[[Category:1960s action films]]\n[[Category:1960s martial arts films]]\n[[Category:Hong Kong action films]]\n[[Category:Hong Kong martial arts films]]\n[[Category:1960s Mandarin-language films]]\n[[Category:Wuxia films]]\n[[Category:Shaw Brothers Studio films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Chang Cheh]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Hong Kong]]\n[[Category:Films about amputees]]"}]}}}}
