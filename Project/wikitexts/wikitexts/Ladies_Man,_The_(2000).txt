The film stars [[Tim Meadows]], who also wrote the film along with Dennis McNicholas and Andrew Steele. The film focuses on the exploits of radio host and [[sex therapy]] expert Leon Phelps, a character Meadows developed on ''SNL''.\n\n==Plot==\nLeon Phelps (also known as the \"''Ladies Man''\") was a ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' character played by [[Tim Meadows]] during the 1990s.  The sketch was that of a broadcast program in which Phelps, a young, suave black man, would give dubious romantic advice and lovemaking tips.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lycos.com/info/tim-meadows.html |title=Tim Meadows |publisher=Lycos.com |date=1961-02-05 |access-date=2010-11-05}}</ref>  The Ladies Man openly proclaimed that he would court any woman at all including [[wikt:skank|skank]]s, providing the woman weighs no more than 250 pounds.  A night of romance would generally center around a bottle of [[Courvoisier]].\n\nAfter finally going too far during a broadcast, Leon is fired, but he receives a note from one of his former flames who wants him to come back to her\u2014and is willing to support him in high style. This sounds just fine with Leon, except that the woman didn't sign her name, and now Leon has to backtrack through his numerous conquests of the past and figure out who wants him to work his love magic. Meanwhile, a secret group called the Victims of the Smiling Ass (V.S.A. for short), consisting of the angry husbands and boyfriends whose women have cheated with Leon, have discovered Leon as their target and are now hot on his trail, eager to get revenge.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n*[[Tim Meadows]] as Leon Phelps\n*[[Karyn Parsons]] as Julie Simmons\n*[[Billy Dee Williams]] as Lester\n*[[Tiffani Thiessen]] as Honey DeLune\n*[[Lee Evans (comedian)|Lee Evans]] as Barney\n*[[Will Ferrell]] as Lance DeLune\n*[[Sofia Milos]] as Cheryl\n*[[Jill Talley]] as Candy\n*[[John Witherspoon (actor)|John Witherspoon]] as Scrap Iron\n*[[Ken Hudson Campbell|Ken Campbell]] as Hal\n*[[Rocky Carroll]] as Cyrus Cunningham\n*[[Tamala Jones]] as Theresa\n*[[Kevin McDonald]] as Mail Man\n*[[Julianne Moore]] as Audrey\n*[[Eugene Levy]] as Bucky Kent\n*David Huband as Frank\n*[[Arnold Pinnock]] as V.S.A.

[[Rotten Tomatoes]] gives the film a score of 11% based on reviews from 73 critics, with an average rating of 3.2/10. The critical consensus reads, \"''The Ladies Man'' joins the growing list of mediocre movies based on ''SNL'' skits. It just doesn't have enough material to last the length of the movie.\"<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1101029-ladies_man/ |title=The Ladies Man Movie |publisher= [[Fandango Media|Fandango]] | work = Rotten Tomatoes |access-date=February 15, 2019}}</ref> [[Roger Ebert]] gave the film 1 star out of a possible 4: \"The character, with his disco suits and giant afro, is funny on TV--but then so are most of the recurring \"SNL\" characters; that's why the show recycles them. At feature length, Leon loses his optimistic charm and slogs through a lame-brained formula story that doesn't understand him.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/the-ladies-man-2000|title = The Ladies Man movie review & film summary (2000) &#124; Roger Ebert}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of recurring Saturday Night Live characters and sketches]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20000815053052/http://www.ladiesmanmovie.com/|title=The Ladies Man}}\n* {{IMDb title|id=0213790|title=The Ladies Man}}\n\n{{Saturday Night Live}}\n{{Reginald Hudlin}}\n{{Lorne Michaels}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Ladies Man, The}}\n[[Category:2000 films]]\n[[Category:2000 comedy films]]\n[[Category:2000s sex comedy films]]\n[[Category:African-American comedy films]]\n[[Category:American sex comedy films]]\n[[Category:2000s English-language films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Reginald Hudlin]]\n[[Category:Films produced by Lorne Michaels]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Toronto]]\n[[Category:Paramount Pictures films]]\n[[Category:Saturday Night Live films]]\n[[Category:2000s American films]]"}]}}}}
