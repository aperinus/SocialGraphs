The Amistad|legal battle]] that followed their capture by the ''[[Washington (1837)|Washington]]'', a [[United States Revenue Cutter Service|U.S. revenue cutter]]. The case was ultimately [[United States v. The Amistad|resolved by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1841]].\n\n[[Morgan Freeman]], [[Anthony Hopkins]], [[Djimon Hounsou]], and [[Matthew McConaughey]] had starring roles. [[David Franzoni]]'s screenplay was based on the 1987 book ''[[Mutiny on the Amistad: The Saga of a Slave Revolt and Its Impact on American Abolition, Law, and Diplomacy]]'', by professor Howard Jones.\n\nThe film received largely positive critical reviews and grossed over $58 million worldwide.\n\n==Plot==\nThe [[schooner]] ''La Amistad'' is transporting black slaves off the coast of the [[Captaincy General of Cuba|Spanish colony of Cuba]] in 1839. One of the captives, [[Joseph Cinqu\u00e9|Cinqu\u00e9]], leads an uprising against the crew, most of whom are killed. Against Cinqu\u00e9's better judgement, the group decide to spare the lives of two navigators, Pedro Montez and Jose Ruiz, on condition they help them sail the ship to Africa. However, the Spaniards betray them and instead plot a course northward into US waters, where the ship is stopped by the [[United States Revenue Cutter Service|U.S. revenue cutter]] ''[[Washington (1837)|Washington]]'', and the surviving mutineers are taken into custody.\n\nA complicated legal battle ensues over the slaves. United States Attorney [[William S. Holabird]] brings charges of piracy and murder against them for killing the crew of ''La Amistad'', but they are simultaneously claimed as property both by Montez & Ruiz and, under the principle of [[marine salvage]], by two officers from the ''Washington''. The Spanish government of [[Isabella II of Spain|Queen Isabella]]{{efn|Queen [[Isabella II of Spain]] was the nominal head of the Spanish government, but at the time was ten years old and living in exile in Rome with her mother [[Maria Christina of the Two Sicilies]] while Spain was under the liberal [[regency]] of [[Baldomero Espartero]] and under the government of [[prime minister]] [[Antonio Gonz\u00e1lez y Gonz\u00e1lez|Antonio Gonz\u00e1lez, 1st Marquess of Valdeterrazo]].}} intervenes in support of Montez & Ruiz, arguing that the United States is obliged to respect the property of Spanish seafarers under the [[Pinckney's Treaty|Treaty of San Lorenzo]]. In order to avoid a diplomatic incident, President [[Martin Van Buren]] directs his [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[John Forsyth (politician)|John Forsyth]] to support the Spanish claim. Meanwhile, the abolitionist [[Lewis Tappan]] and his black associate Theodore Joadson (a former slave himself), resolve to help the captives. They approach the brilliant lawyer, former US president and serving [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. representative]] [[John Quincy Adams]], but he is reluctant to get involved, forcing them to instead hire the young and eccentric attorney [[Roger Sherman Baldwin]] to represent the slaves.\n\nBaldwin is unable to converse directly with his new clients because they lack a common language, but through his attempts to communicate with Cinqu\u00e9 he comes to suspect that the slaves are not Cubans but Africans who have been kidnapped and transported illegally across the Atlantic as part of the banned [[transatlantic slave trade]]. He and Joadson search ''La Amistad'' and find hidden documents which prove that the captives were kidnapped from [[Sierra Leone Colony and Protectorate|Sierra Leone]] and transported across the Atlantic aboard the Portuguese slave ship ''[[Tecora]]'' before being transferred to ''La Amistad'' in [[Havana]]. The judge is impressed by this new evidence, and signals his intention to dismiss the US and Spanish governments' case and release the captives.\n\nTo preclude this possibility, Van Buren has the judge dismissed and replaced with a younger man, Coglin, who he assumes will be easier to manipulate. A despondent Joadson seeks advice from Adams, who tells him that court cases are usually won by the side with the best 'story'. Baldwin and Joadson therefore recruit [[James Covey]], a [[freedman]] who speaks both [[Mende language|Mende]] and English, to act as a translator, thereby enabling Cinqu\u00e9 to testify directly before the court. He describes in detail how he was kidnapped from his home, and the horrors which he witnessed during the [[Middle Passage]]. To corroborate Cinqu\u00e9's testimony, Baldwin also calls as a witness Captain Fitzgerald of the [[Royal Navy]]'s [[West Africa Squadron]], who explains how Cinqu\u00e9's account chimes with his own experience of fighting the slave trade. He also speculates that the captives were probably taken aboard the ''Tecora'' at a notorious [[slave fort]] called [[Lomboko]]. However, under cross-questioning from Holabird and Forsyth, Fitzgerald admits that there is no direct evidence that Lomboko actually exists. As the tension in the courtroom rises, Cinqu\u00e9 abruptly stands and demands, \"Give us, us free!\". Moved by Cinqu\u00e9's display of emotion, Judge Coglin rules that the Africans are to be released and that Montez & Ruiz are to be arrested and charged with illegal slave-trading.\n\nUnder pressure from Senator [[John C. Calhoun]] of [[South Carolina]], who represents the slave-holding interests of the [[Antebellum South|American South]], Van Buren appeals the case to the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]]. Baldwin and Joadson visit Adams again, and after meeting Cinqu\u00e9 he finally agrees to represent the Africans before the Supreme Court. Adams makes an impassioned and eloquent speech which successfully convinces the court to [[United States v. The Amistad|confirm the earlier judgement]] and release the Africans, despite the fact that a majority of the justices are themselves slave-owning Southerners.\n\nMeanwhile, Lomboko is stormed by [[Royal Marines]] under the command of Captain Fitzgerald, and the slaves held there are freed. Fitzgerald subsequently orders the ship's cannon to destroy the fortress, and dictates a sardonic letter to Forsyth saying that he was correct \u2014 the infamous slave fort does not now exist.\n\nVan Buren is discredited by his failure to prevent the release of the Africans, and loses the 1840 election to [[William Henry Harrison]]. The Spanish government nevertheless continues to press its claim for compensation right up to the [[American Civil War]].\n\nCinqu\u00e9 eventually returns to Africa, but is never able to reunite with his family due to a civil war in Sierra Leone.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Djimon Hounsou]] as [[Joseph Cinqu\u00e9|Sengbe Pieh / Joseph Cinqu\u00e9]]\n* [[Matthew McConaughey]] as [[Roger Sherman Baldwin]]\n* [[Anthony Hopkins]] as [[John Quincy Adams]]\n* [[Morgan Freeman]] as Theodore Joadson\n* [[Nigel Hawthorne]] as President [[Martin Van Buren]]\n* [[David Paymer]] as Secretary of State [[John Forsyth (politician)|John Forsyth]]\n* [[Pete Postlethwaite]] as [[William S.

[...] ''Schindler's List'' works better as narrative because it is about a risky deception, while ''Amistad'' is about the search for a truth that, if found, will be small consolation to the millions of existing slaves. As a result, the movie doesn't have the emotional charge of Spielberg's earlier film \u2014 or of ''The Color Purple,'' which moved me to tears.
