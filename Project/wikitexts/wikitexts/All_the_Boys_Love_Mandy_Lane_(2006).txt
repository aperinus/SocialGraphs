The plot centers on a group of popular high schoolers who invite an attractive outsider, Mandy Lane, to spend the weekend at a secluded ranch house, where they are followed by a merciless killer.\n\nOriginally completed in 2006, the film premiered at a number of [[film festival]]s throughout 2006 and 2007, including the [[Toronto International Film Festival]], [[Sitges Film Festival]], [[South by Southwest]], and [[London FrightFest Film Festival]]. It received a theatrical release in the United Kingdom on February 15, 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bloody-disgusting.com/news/16117 |author=Miska, Brad |title= 'Mandy Lane' Is Too Much of a Tease, Moving On | work=Bloody Disgusting |date= May 6, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161024091740/http://bloody-disgusting.com/news/16117|archive-date=October 24, 2016|url-status = dead |access-date=October 20, 2010}}</ref> ''All the Boys Love Mandy Lane'' received mixed reviews from critics, with some dismissing the film as \"bogus and compromised\", and others praising its \"[[grindhouse]]\" aesthetic and likening its [[cinematography]] to the early work of [[Terrence Malick]]<ref name=\"guardian\" /><ref name=\"efilm\" /> and [[Tobe Hooper]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.heavemedia.com/2013/10/13/movie-review-all-the-boys-love-mandy-lane/|work=Heave Media |title=Movie review: \"All the Boys Love Mandy Lane\" |last=Suzanne-Mayer |first=Dominick |date=October 13, 2013|access-date=October 25, 2013}}</ref>\n\nDespite its international attention, the film remained unreleased in the United States for over seven years after it was completed; this was due to complications with its distributor, Senator Entertainment, which went bankrupt shortly after purchasing the film from [[The Weinstein Company]]. On March 8, 2013, it was announced that The Weinstein Company had re-acquired the rights to theatrically release the film in the United States. The film became available through [[video on demand]] in September 2013, and was given a [[limited release]] on October 11, 2013, through a joint contract between Senator Entertainment and Weinstein's subsidiary label [[The Weinstein Company|Radius-TWC]].\n\n==Plot==\nAt a Texas high school, Mandy Lane blossoms over the summer, attracting her male classmates. One of them, Dylan, invites Mandy to a pool party at his house. She accepts with the provision that her best friend Emmet can come along. At the party Dylan bullies and humiliates Emmet, until Mandy intervenes. As revenge, Emmet convinces a drunken Dylan to jump from the roof into the pool, but Dylan fails to scale the pool and smashes his head on the concrete, which kills him.\n\nNine months later, Mandy has since befriended many of Dylan's popular friends, while Emmet has been subjected to even more intense bullying. Their [[Cannabis culture|stoner]] classmate Red plans a weekend party at his father's remote ranch, and Mandy reluctantly accepts an invitation from Chloe, a popular but insecure cheerleader. Mandy accompanies Red and Chloe, along with several other classmates\u2014including reserved football player Bird, and romantic couple Jake and Marlin\u2014to Red's ranch. Upon arriving, they are introduced to Garth, the [[ranch hand]].\n\nThat night, Jake gets offended over a joke and storms off to a nearby barn, where Marlin performs oral sex on him. They have another argument and, after Jake walks back to the house, an unseen assailant knocks Marlin out and breaks her jaw with the barrel of a shotgun. Back at the house, Jake unsuccessfully attempts to woo Mandy. Anxious about Marlin, Jake then takes Red's shotgun and pickup truck to go search for her. He eventually finds her sitting by a remote lake. Upon closer look, he sees her mangled face, and is confronted by Emmet, seeking vengeance for the humiliation he has suffered. Emmet shoots Jake in the head and breaks Marlin's neck, killing both.\n\nEmmet drives back to the ranch in Red's truck and sees the rest of the group on the porch. He shoots fireworks at them. Bird gives chase, believing the driver to be Jake, playing a prank. Emmet confronts Bird and attacks him, eventually slashing his eyes with a knife and stabbing him to death. The rest of the group, drunk and high, fall asleep at the house along with Garth.\n\nThe next morning, as the group leaves out the front door, Emmet shoots and wounds Garth. While Mandy tends to Garth, Red and Chloe try to run to Chloe's car. Emmet shoots Red and chases after Chloe. In Garth's shack, Mandy retrieves the keys to his truck and finds the bloodied knife that Emmet used to kill Bird. She goes outside to find Chloe being chased in her direction. Mandy embraces Chloe, but then stabs her in the stomach, revealing that she is in league with Emmet.\n\nAs Chloe bleeds to death, Mandy and Emmet discuss the [[suicide pact]] they had planned. Mandy reveals she had no intention of going through with it, convinced that Emmet agreed to the murders only on the basis of winning her affection. Refusing to let her back down, Emmet prepares to shoot her, but Garth intervenes by wounding Emmet with his shotgun, prompting Emmet to stab him multiple times. Emmet chases Mandy into the fields, where they fall into a ditch filled with cattle carcasses. Mandy grabs a log and defends herself against Emmet's machete. Eventually she gets the upper hand and kills him. She returns to an injured Garth and they drive away from the ranch. Assuming she was also merely a victim of the carnage, Garth thanks Mandy for saving his life.\n\nA [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]] shows the group back at a railroad track, where they took a break from their drive. While the rest goof off, Mandy balances on the tracks and watches her future victims.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Amber Heard]] as Mandy Lane\n* [[Michael Welch (actor)|Michael Welch]] as Emmet \n* [[Anson Mount]] as Garth\n* [[Whitney Able]] as Chloe\n* [[Edwin Hodge]] as Bird\n* [[Aaron Himelstein]] as Red\n* [[Luke Grimes]] as Jake\n* Melissa Price as Marlin \n* Adam Powell as Dylan \n* Peyton Hayslip as Aunt Jo\n* [[Brooke Bloom]] as Jen\n* [[Robert Earl Keen]] as Keg Trucker\n}}\n\n==Analysis==\nSeveral film critics have drawn comparisons between the events in the film and those perpetrated by [[Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold]], the teenagers responsible for the [[Columbine High School massacre|Columbine massacre]]\u2014in particular, the character of Emmet, who in one scene is shown wearing a shirt similar to that worn by Eric Harris on the day of the massacre.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nyulocal.com/entertainment/2013/09/20/all-the-boys-love-mandy-lane-and-now-you-finally-can-too/|work=NYU Local |publisher=[[New York University]]|archive-url=https://archive.today/20180502074030/https://nyulocal.com/all-the-boys-love-mandy-lane-and-now-you-finally-can-too-f7637418eb45?gi=3641b59fa249|archive-date=May 2, 2018|title=''All The Boys Love Mandy Lane'', And Now You Finally Can Too |date=September 20, 2013|access-date=October 25, 2013|last=McEwen |first=Chris |url-status = live|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thegridto.com/culture/film/the-losers-revenge-school-violence-and-screen-monsters/|work=The Grid |title=The loser's revenge: school violence and screen monsters |date=October 4, 2013|access-date=October 25, 2013|last=Anderson|first=Jason|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131014224457/http://www.thegridto.com/culture/film/the-losers-revenge-school-violence-and-screen-monsters/|archive-date=October 14, 2013|url-status = dead |df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref name=\"nypost\" />\n\nFilm scholars Cristelle Maury and David Roche, in their introduction to ''Women Who Kill: Gender and Sexuality in Film and Series of the Post-Feminist Era'' (2020), note that the film inverts the trope of the \"[[final girl]]\" by revealing her to be a \"diabolical mastermind.\"{{sfn|Maury|Roche|2020|p=13}} Writing of the revelation, they note: \"As Mandy beckons her, Chloe runs right into her friend's arms, impaling herself on a knife in a back shot that prevents us from anticipating such an outcome...&nbsp; The twist is merely a millennial update of the ending in ''[[Friday the 13th (1980 film)|Friday the 13th]]'' (1980), with two significant differences: Mandy's sadism warrants no justification, and as the film's Final Girl, she is the audience's stand-in.\"{{sfn|Maury|Roche|2020|p=13}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\n[[File:Boys Love Mandy Lane screenshot.png|thumb|right|250px|Screenshot of the film, showing how director Levine was influenced by [[Tobe Hooper]]'s ''[[The Texas Chain Saw Massacre]]'' (1974) when crafting the film's [[composition (visual arts)|compositions]] and photography of landscapes.<ref name=\"chronicle\" />]]\nThe film had initially been conceived in 2003 when writer Jacob Forman, producer Chad Feehan, and production designer Tom Hammock were all students at the [[American Film Institute]].<ref name=\"twitch\">{{cite web|url=http://twitchfilm.com/2011/03/writer-director-chad-sheehan-tells-us-whats-beneath-the-dark.html|work=Twitch Film |title=Writer/Director Chad Feehan Tells Us What's Beneath the Dark |date=March 28, 2011|access-date=August 25, 2013|last=Webb|first=Charles|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131021074438/http://twitchfilm.com/2011/03/writer-director-chad-sheehan-tells-us-whats-beneath-the-dark.html|archive-date=October 21, 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite interview|url=http://www.craveonline.com/film/interviews/585063-exclusive-interview-jonathan-levine-on-all-the-boys-love-mandy-lane|work=Crave Online |title=Exclusive Interview: Jonathan Levine on All the Boys Love Mandy Lane |date=October 9, 2013|accessdate=October 20, 2013|last=Topel |first=Fred |interviewer=Jonathan Levine}}</ref> \"I actually started it as my [[thesis]] at AFI,\" Feehan told [[Twitch Film]].<ref name=\"twitch\" /> \"The writer, Jacob Forman and the production designer Tom Hammock and I did it as our thesis together at AFI.

In an interview, she said, \"There are so many [scripts] you get where it feels like you're reading the same girl over and over again.
