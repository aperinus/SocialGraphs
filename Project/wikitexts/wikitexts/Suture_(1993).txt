He plants a car bomb in an attempt to kill a nearly identical half-brother, Clay Arlington, after persuading Arlington to switch identities with him.\n\nArlington survives, but requires facial reconstruction and also has lost most of his memory. Dr. Renee Descartes is there during his recovery. Towers resurfaces and tries once more to eliminate him, but is killed himself. Arlington makes a decision to make his new identity a permanent one.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Dennis Haysbert]] as Clay Arlington\n* [[Mel Harris]] as Dr. Renee Descartes\n* [[Sab Shimono]] as Dr. Max Shinoda\n* [[Dina Merrill]] as Alice Jameson\n* Michael Harris as Vincent Towers\n* [[David Graf]] as Lt.

Afterwards, they decided to make a feature-length film and \"attempted to construct a story that was generally about identity\".<ref name=\"Romney\"/> McGehee has said that ''Suture'' was influenced by mid-1960s Japanese films and Hollywood films like ''[[North by Northwest]]''.<ref name=\"Altman\">{{cite news | last= Altman | first= Mark A | title=Restitched Noir | work=[[Film Threat]] | date=June 1994}}</ref> Specifically, they were inspired by [[Hiroshi Teshigahara]]'s ''The Face of Another'' and [[Yoshitaro Nomura]]'s ''Tokyo Bay'', which utilized widescreen black and white cinematography. They also wanted to give the film an early '60s sensibility and loved the widescreen black and white films from that period: ''[[The Manchurian Candidate (1962 film)|The Manchurian Candidate]]'' and ''[[Seconds (1966 film)|Seconds]]''. Siegel said, \"It's an absolutely gripping look that's used so rarely today, and it's a look from a time period that we wanted to evoke\".<ref name=\"Altman\"/>\n\nMcGehee and Siegel set up a limited partnership and borrowed money for the $1 million budget from family and friends.<ref name=\"Altman\"/> They decided to shoot ''Suture'' in [[Phoenix, Arizona]] because McGehee felt that it was \"almost like an abandoned city, it's so large and overbuilt and the streets are so dead it feels empty\". They liked the city's \"high modernist, very spare aesthetic\".<ref name=\"Romney\"/> After seeing an early rough cut of the film, [[Steven Soderbergh]] became fascinated with it and helped McGehee and Siegel find completion finances during post-production.<ref name=\"Altman\"/>\n\n==Release==\n''Suture'' had its premiere at the 1993 [[Telluride Film Festival]] with screenings at the [[Sundance Film Festival]] and [[Toronto International Film Festival|Toronto Festival of Festivals]].<ref name=\"Altman\"/>  A 4K restoration was completed in 2016, and released on Blu-ray by [[Arrow Video]] in July 2016.<ref>[http://www.criterionforum.org/DVD-review/suture-dual-format-edition/arrow-video/1659 Criterion Fourm]</ref>\n\n==Awards==\n*In 1994, Scott McGehee and David Siegel won ''Best Director'' at the [[Sitges - Catalan International Film Festival]]\n*In 1994, Greg Gardiner won ''Cinematography Award'' at the [[Sundance Film Festival]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{IMDb title|0108260|Suture}}\n* {{Rotten Tomatoes|suture}}\n* {{amg movie|131189|Suture}}\n\n{{Scott McGehee and David Siegel}}\n\n[[Category:1993 films]]\n[[Category:1993 drama films]]\n[[Category:American mystery films]]\n[[Category:1990s English-language films]]\n[[Category:American black-and-white films]]\n[[Category:The Samuel Goldwyn Company films]]\n[[Category:American neo-noir films]]\n[[Category:Films about amnesia]]\n[[Category:1990s American films]]"}]}}}}
