It stars the voices of [[Elijah Wood]], [[Robin Williams]], [[Brittany Murphy]], [[Hugh Jackman]], [[Nicole Kidman]], [[Hugo Weaving]], and [[E.G. Daily]]. An [[international co-production]] between the United States and Australia, the film was produced at [[Sydney]]-based [[visual effects]] and [[animation studio]] [[Animal Logic]] for [[Warner Bros.]], [[Village Roadshow Pictures]], and Kingdom Feature Productions, and was released in [[North America]] theaters on November 17, 2006, and in Australia theaters on December 26, 2006. It is the first animated film produced by Kennedy Miller and Animal Logic. Set in the cold land of [[Antarctica]], the film follows on Mumble, an emperor penguin who, despite his lacking the ability to sing the heartsong to attract a soul mate, is able to tap dance brilliantly. After being exiled from Emperor Land by Noah the Elder, Mumble befriends the Amigos, who help him rediscover himself.\n\nThough primarily an animated film, the film does incorporate [[motion capture]] of live action humans in certain scenes.

If the [[male]] penguin's heartsong matches the [[female]]'s song, the two penguins mate. Norma Jean, a female penguin, falls for Memphis, a male penguin and they become mates. They lay an egg, which Memphis cares for while Norma Jean leaves with the other females to [[fish]]. While the males struggle through the harsh [[winter]], Memphis briefly drops the egg. The resulting chick, Mumble, is unable to sing but can [[tap dance]]. Nevertheless, he is enamored with Gloria, a female penguin who is regarded as the most talented of her age. One day, Mumble encounters a group of hostile [[skua]], with a leader who is tagged with a [[bird ringing|yellow band]], which he says is from an [[alien abduction]]. Mumble narrowly escapes the hungry birds by falling into a crevice.\n\nNow a young adult, Mumble is frequently ridiculed by the elders and their leader Noah. After escaping from a [[leopard seal]] attack, Mumble befriends five [[Adelie penguin]]s named Ram\u00f3n, Nestor, Lombardo, Rinaldo and Raul, known collectively as \"the Amigos\", who embrace Mumble's dance moves and assimilate him into their group. After seeing a hidden human [[excavator]] in an avalanche, they opt to ask Lovelace, a [[Northern rockhopper penguin|rockhopper penguin]], about its origin. Lovelace has the plastic rings of a six pack entangled around his neck, saying that they have been bestowed upon him by mystic beings.\n\nFor the emperor penguins, it is mating season and Gloria is the center of attention. The Amigos unsuccessfully attempt to help Mumble win her affection by having Ram\u00f3n sing a Spanish version of \"[[My Way (song)|My Way]]\" behind Mumble, with the latter [[lip sync]]ing. After Mumble desperately begins tap dancing in synch with her song, she falls for him and the youthful penguins join in for singing and dancing to \"[[Boogie Wonderland]]\". The elders are appalled by Mumble's conduct, which they see as the reason for their lean fishing season. Memphis begs Mumble to stop dancing, for his own sake, but when Mumble refuses, he is exiled.\n\nMumble and the Amigos return to Lovelace, only to find him being choked by the plastic rings. Lovelace confesses they were snagged on him while swimming off the forbidden shores, beyond the land of the [[elephant seals]]. Not long into their journey, Gloria encounters them, wishing to become Mumble's mate. Fearing for her safety, he ridicules Gloria, driving her away.\n\nAt the forbidden shore, Mumble, Lovelace and the Amigos are attacked by the two [[orca]]s, during which Lovelace gets free from the plastic rings. After escaping, they find a fishing boat. Mumble exhaustingly pursues it alone, eventually washing up on the shore of [[Florida]], where he is rescued and kept at Sea World with [[Magellanic penguin]]s. After a long and secluded confinement in addition to fruitlessly trying to communicate with the humans, he nearly succumbs to [[Insanity|madness]]. When a girl attempts to interact with Mumble by tapping the glass, he starts dancing, which attracts a large crowd. He is released back into the wild, with a [[GPS wildlife tracking|tracking device]] attached to his back. He returns to his colony and challenges the will of the elders. Memphis reconciles with him, just as a research team arrives, verifying Mumble's statements of \"aliens\" existing. The entire colony engages in dance in front of the research team, whose expedition footage prompts a worldwide debate, which eventually leads to the banning of all Antarctic [[overfishing]], satisfying both the emperor penguins and the Amigos.\n\n==Cast==\n{{multiple image\n|perrow = 2\n|total_width = 250\n|align = right\n|image1=Happy Feet Premiere (307976990).jpg\n|width1=1200\n|height1=1600\n|image2=Happy Feet Premiere (307987303).jpg\n|width2=1200\n|height2=1600\n|image3=Happy Feet Premiere (3).jpg\n|width3=1536\n|height3=2304\n|image4=Happy Feet Premiere (307982333).jpg\n|width4=1200\n|height4=1600\n|footer=[[Elijah Wood]], [[Robin Williams]], [[Brittany Murphy]] and [[Nicole Kidman]] at the film's European premiere in London, UK.\n}}\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Elijah Wood]] as Mumble\n** [[E.

By the time they'd landed, Warner had decided to provide funding on the film. Production was slated to begin sometime after the completion of the fourth ''Mad Max'' film, ''[[Mad Max: Fury Road|Fury Road]]'', but geo-political complications pushed ''Happy Feet'' to the forefront in early 2003.\n\nThe animation is invested heavily in [[motion capture]] technology, with the dance scenes acted out by human dancers.

The film took four years to make. Ben Gunsberger, Lighting Supervisor and VFX Department Supervisor, says this was partly because they needed to build new infrastructure and tools. The server farm used IBM BladeCenter framework and BladeCenter HS20 [[blade server]]s, which are extremely dense separate computer units each with two Intel [[Xeon]] processors. Rendering took up 17 million CPU hours over a nine-month period.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www-01.ibm.com/software/success/cssdb.nsf/cs/mcag-6h2sr2?opendocument&site=corp |title=Animal Logic builds rendering farm with IBM eServer BladeCenter |access-date=1 February 2010 |publisher=IBM Australia}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Miller, the environmental message was not a major part of the original script, but \"In [[Australia]], we're very, very aware of the ozone hole,\" he said, \"and Antarctica is literally the [[Animal sentinel|canary in the coal mine]] for this stuff.
