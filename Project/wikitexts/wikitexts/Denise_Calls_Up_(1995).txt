The plot revolves around a group of friends in New York City who, while working at their [[Personal computer|PCs]] and laptops and keeping in touch by phone and [[fax]], never seem to be able to get together.\n\n==Plot==\nLinda wakes up one morning to her ringing phone. Her friend, Gale wants to know how her party went last night. To her dismay, Linda tells her that no one showed up, \"not a one.\"  Thus begins ''Denise Calls Up'', the story of seven friends living in [[New York City]] who no longer find it necessary to actually meet face to face due to the [[Internet age|new age of the internet and wireless phones]]. But Gale is less upset about the absolute absenteeism, than about the fact that her friend Barbara never got to meet Jerry. Gale has been trying to set them up.  So she calls Barbara, chastising her for not making it to Linda's and goading her into meeting Jerry. After protesting that she's just been too busy, Barbara eventually acquiesces. Meanwhile, Denise, who has gotten pregnant by an anonymous [[Artificial insemination|sperm insemination]], locates the donor, Martin, and decides to call him. And so it goes, as the characters, via phone and fax, duck and miss each other time after time, using one excuse after the other to avoid meetings, births, and even a funeral until, finally, Frank, determined to finally get everyone together, plans a New Year's Eve party.  All swear that they will be there.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Tim Daly]] as Frank Oliver\n* Caroleen Feeney as Barbara Gorton\n* Dan Gunther as Martin Weiner\n* [[Dana Wheeler-Nicholson]] as Gale Donelly\n* [[Liev Schreiber]] as Jerry Heckerman\n** [[Hal Salwen]] as young Jerry \n* [[Aida Turturro]] as Linda\n* [[Alanna Ubach]] as Denise Devaro\n* [[Sylvia Miles]] as Sharon, Gail's Aunt\n* [[Jean-Claude La Marre]] as Dalton Philips, cab driver (as Jean LaMarre)\n* Mark Blum as Dr. Brennan, Obstetrician\n\n==Reception==\n<!-- ===Critics=== -->\n[[Rotten Tomatoes]] gives the film a 74% \"Certified Fresh\" rating based on 23 reviews.<ref>{{cite web |title=Denise Calls Up (1995) |url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/denise_calls_up/ |website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |access-date=2022-08-19 }}</ref> \n[[Janet Maslin]] of [[The New York Times|''The New York Times'']] wrote: \"Mr. Salwen's storytelling gambit may sound like a stunt, but he does a remarkably agile job of sustaining it throughout a sunny 80-minute comedy.\"<ref name=\"Maslin\">{{cite web |last=Maslin |first=Janet |author-link=Janet Maslin |date=27 March 1996 |title=FILM FESTIVAL REVIEW;Techno-Yuppies Who Live and Die by the Microchip |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/03/27/movies/film-festival-review-techno-yuppies-who-live-and-die-by-the-microchip.html |website=[[The New York Times]]}}</ref><ref name=\"Ebert\">{{cite web |date=April 26, 1996 |last=Ebert |first=Roger |author-link=Roger Ebert |title=Denise Calls Up |url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/denise-calls-up-1996 |website=[[Chicago Sun-Times]] }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |date=13 March 1995 |last=Levy |first=Emanuel |author-link=Emanuel Levy |title=Denise Calls Up |url=https://variety.com/review/VE1117909889 |website=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] }}</ref> \n\n==Awards==\n* Tied for Jury Prize at the [[Deauville American Film Festival]] with ''[[The Brothers McMullen]]''.<ref>{{Cite web |title=1995  {{!}}  21\u00e8me Festival du Cin\u00e9ma Am\u00e9ricain |url=http://www.festival-deauville.com/DEV/index.php?pid=54&e=21/ |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140904071510/http://www.festival-deauville.com/DEV/index.php?pid=54&e=21/ |archive-date=September 4, 2014 |access-date=October 28, 2022 |website=Deauville American Film Festival}}</ref>\n* [[Camera d'Or]] Special Mention at the [[Cannes Film Festival]]<ref>{{Cite web |title=Denise Calls Up {{!}} Denise au t\u00e9l\u00e9phone |url=https://www.semainedelacritique.com/en/edition/1995/movie/denise-calls-up |access-date=October 28, 2022 |website=Cannes Film Festival}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* ''[https://www.sonyclassics.com/denise/ Denise Calls Up]'' at [[Sony Pictures Classics]]\n* {{IMDb title|id=0112844|title=Denise Calls Up}}\n* {{rotten tomatoes|Denise_Calls_Up}}\n* {{amg movie|135096}}\n* {{Mojo title|denisecallsup}}\n\n[[Category:1995 films]]\n[[Category:American independent films]]\n[[Category:1995 independent films]]\n[[Category:1995 comedy films]]\n[[Category:Films set in New York City]]\n[[Category:American comedy films]]\n[[Category:Davis Entertainment films]]\n[[Category:Films produced by John Davis]]\n[[Category:Sony Pictures Classics films]]\n[[Category:1990s English-language films]]\n[[Category:1990s American films]]"}]}}}}
