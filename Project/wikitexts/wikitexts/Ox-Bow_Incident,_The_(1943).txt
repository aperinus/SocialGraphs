Wellman]], starring [[Henry Fonda]], [[Dana Andrews]] and [[Mary Beth Hughes]], with [[Anthony Quinn]], [[William Eythe]], [[Harry Morgan]] and [[Jane Darwell]]. Two cowboys arrive in a Western town, when news arrives that a local rancher has been murdered and his cattle stolen. The townspeople, joined by the two cowboys and cowboys from other ranches, form a posse to catch the perpetrators. They find three men in possession of the cattle, and are determined to see justice done on the spot.\n\nThe film premiered in May 1943 to positive reviews from critics. It was nominated for the [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] for [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]] at the [[16th Academy Awards]], losing to ''[[Casablanca (film)|Casablanca]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://awardsdatabase.oscars.org/ampas_awards/DisplayMain.jsp?curTime=1211030051708|title=1943 (16th annual) Academy Award winner for Outstanding Motion Picture|access-date=May 16, 2008}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> ''The Ox-Bow Incident'' and ''[[The Outlaw]]'' (also produced in 1943) are the earliest films in the [[AllMovie]] list of [[revisionist Western|psychological Westerns]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.allmovie.com/subgenre/psychological-western-d1669/releaseyear-desc/7 |title=Psychological Western |work=AllMovie |access-date=23 January 2022}}</ref>\n\nIn 1998, the film was selected for preservation in the [[United States]] [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/film/nfr98.html|title=National Film Registry, 1998|website=[[Library of Congress]]|access-date=May 16, 2008}}</ref> The film was adapted from the 1940 [[The Ox-Bow Incident (novel)|novel of the same name]], written by Nevadan [[Walter Van Tilburg Clark]].<ref>\"The Ox-Bow Incident (1943)\".

The atmosphere is subdued due to recent incidents of [[Cattle raiding|cattle-rustling]]. Art and Gil are suspected to be rustlers because they have rarely been seen in town.\n\nA man enters the saloon and announces that a rancher named Lawrence \"Larry\" Kinkaid has been murdered. The townspeople immediately form a [[Posse comitatus (common law)|posse]] to pursue the murderers, who they believe are cattle rustlers. A judge tells the posse that it must bring the suspects back for trial, and that its formation by a deputy (the sheriff being out of town) is illegal. Art and Gil join the posse to avoid raising even more suspicion. Davies, who was initially opposed to forming the posse, also joins, along with \"Major\" Tetley and his son Gerald. Poncho informs the posse that three men and cattle bearing Kinkaid's brand have just entered Bridger's Pass.\n\nThe posse encounters a stagecoach. When they try to stop it, the stagecoach guard assumes that it is a stickup, and shoots, wounding Art. In the coach are Rose Mapen, Gil's ex-girlfriend, and her new husband, Swanson.\n\nLater that night in Ox-Bow Canyon, the posse finds three men sleeping, with what are presumed to be stolen cattle nearby. The posse interrogates them: a young, well-spoken man, Donald Martin; a Mexican, Juan Mart\u00ednez; and an old man, Alva Hardwicke. Martin claims that he purchased the cattle from Kinkaid but received no bill of sale. No one believes Martin, and the posse decides to hang the three men at sunrise.\n\nMartin writes a letter to his wife and asks Davies, the only member of the posse that he trusts, to deliver it. Davies reads the letter, and, hoping to save Martin's life, shows it to the others. Davies believes that Martin is innocent and does not deserve to die.\n\nThe Mexican \"Juan\" is recognized as a gambler named Francisco Morez. He tries to escape and is shot and wounded. The posse discovers that Morez has Kinkaid's gun.\n\nMajor Tetley wants the men to be lynched immediately. A vote is taken as to whether the men should be hanged or taken back to stand trial.  Only seven, among them Davies, Gerald Tetley, Gil and Art, vote to take the men back to town alive; the rest support immediate hanging. Gil tries to stop it, but is overpowered.\n\nAfter the lynching, the posse heads back towards Bridger's Wells and immediately encounters Sheriff Risley, who tells them that Lawrence Kinkaid is not dead and that the men who shot him have been arrested. Risley strips the deputy of his badge and asks Davies who is responsible. \u201cAll but seven,\u201d Davies replies, and the sheriff declares \u201cGod better have mercy on you. You won't get any from me.\u201d\n\nThe men of the posse gather in Darby's Saloon and drink in silence. Major Tetley returns to his house, shuts out his son (who condemns his sadistic behavior), goes to his study, and closes the door, before a gunshot is heard from within. In the saloon, Gil reads Martin's letter to Art while members of the posse listen. In the letter, Martin confessed feeling sorry for the posse members, who will have to live with what they have done for the rest of their lives. In the final scene Gil and Art head out of town by the same route they rode in to deliver the letter and $500 (${{Inflation|US|500|1885|r=-2|fmt=c}} today) raised by those in the posse for Martin's wife.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Henry Fonda]] as Gil Carter \n* [[Dana Andrews]] as Donald Martin \n* [[Harry Morgan]] as Art Croft\n* [[Frank Conroy (actor)|Frank Conroy]] as Major Tetley \n* [[Harry Davenport (actor)|Harry Davenport]] as Mr. Arthur Davies \n* [[Anthony Quinn]] as Juan Mart\u00ednez / Francisco Morez, The Mexican\n* [[Francis Ford (actor)|Francis Ford]] as Alva Hardwicke, The Old Man\n* [[William Eythe]] as Gerald Tetley \n* [[Mary Beth Hughes]] as Rose Mapen / Rose Swanson\n* [[Jane Darwell]] as \"Ma\" Jenny Grier \n* [[Marc Lawrence]] as Jeff Farnley \n* [[Paul Hurst (actor)|Paul Hurst]] as Monty Smith \n* [[Chris-Pin Martin]] as Poncho \n* [[Leigh Whipper]] as Sparks ''(uncredited)''\n* [[Stanley Andrews]] as Bartlett ''(uncredited)''\n* [[Victor Kilian]] as Darby, bartender\n* Matt Briggs as Judge Daniel Tyler \n* [[Willard Robertson]] as Sheriff Risley\n* Dick Rich as Deputy Butch Mapes ''(uncredited)''\n* [[George Meeker]] as Mr. Swanson, Rose's husband ''(uncredited)''\n* [[Billy Benedict]] as young man with news ''(uncredited)''\n* [[Margaret Hamilton (actress)|Margaret Hamilton]] as Judge Tyler's housekeeper ''(uncredited)''\n* [[Hank Bell]] as Red ''(uncredited)''\n}}\n\n==Production==\nDirector [[William A. Wellman]] loved the novel and wanted to adapt it into a film and then interested [[Darryl F. Zanuck]] in producing it. Zanuck agreed in producing the story, on the condition that Wellman would also direct two other films for the studio, ''[[Thunder Birds (1942 film)|Thunder Birds]]'' (1942) and ''[[Buffalo Bill (1944 film)|Buffalo Bill]]'' (1944).\n\nThere are several differences between the film and the novel, notably the fate of the Tetleys and the fate of the lynch mob. In the book, young Gerald commits suicide by hanging himself in the barn. This leads his father to fall on his cavalry sword. The sheriff stares down each member of the mob, but then he says he will forget everything.<ref>{{Citation|title=The Ox-Bow Incident (novel)|date=March 20, 2020|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Ox-Bow_Incident_(novel)&oldid=946457637|work=Wikipedia|language=en|access-date=August 25, 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe role of Gil Carter, played by [[Henry Fonda]], was originally offered to [[Gary Cooper]], who turned it down. Fonda was generally unhappy with the quality of the films he was cast in while under contract with [[20th Century Fox]]. This was one of only two films from that period that he was enthusiastic about acting in (the other was ''[[The Grapes of Wrath (film)|The Grapes of Wrath]]'', made in 1940). Fonda regarded this film as one of his favorites.\n\nFilming was done from late June to early August 1942, mostly in studio back-lots and sound stages; a limited amount of location shooting was done at a ranch in [[Chatsworth, Los Angeles|Chatsworth]] and in [[Lone Pine, California|Lone Pine]], both in California. Additional sequences and retakes were done mid-August to late August. \nThe production on the film would be shut down for a week or ten days \"due to the $5,000-per-film limit on new construction materials\" (imposed by the [[War Production Board]]). During the shutdown, already used sets were torn down so their materials could be used to build the mountain pass set. Studio publicity noted that the Ox-Bow Valley setting was \"the largest set ever constructed\" by Fox, covering {{Convert|26703|sqft|m2 acre|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"TCMDB\">{{cite web|title=Ox-Bow Incident archive materials|url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/434290/The-Ox-Bow-Incident/|website=TCM movie database|publisher=Turner Classic Movies|access-date=February 25, 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe western street set seen in this film was subsequently used in another western, ''[[The Gunfighter]]'' (1950), which starred [[Gregory Peck]].\n\nAfter filming was completed, Fonda immediately enlisted in the [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]], in which he served until 1946.\n\nAfter the film was completed, it was kept on the shelf for months because Fox executives were uncertain how to market a film with such a sobering theme.\n\n==Reception==\nThe film received mostly positive reviews. [[Bosley Crowther]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote that it \"is not a picture which will brighten or cheer your day.

In spite of its significance and its dramatic value, our records showed that it had failed to pay its way.
