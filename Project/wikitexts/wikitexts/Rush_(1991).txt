It stars [[Jennifer Jason Leigh]] and [[Jason Patric]] as two cops in the 1970s who go undercover on a case. They become [[drug addiction|drug addicts]] themselves and, under pressure from the chief of police, falsified evidence in some cases. The book and film are both based on a 1978-79 drug scandal involving the [[Tyler, Texas]] police department and [[Smith County, Texas]] Sheriff's Office. An FBI investigation led to the book's author and her partner pleading guilty to perjury, serving time in federal prison, and testifying in a federal civil rights case against Tyler, Texas police chief Willie Hardy, who was found not guilty by a jury of his peers in Smith County, Texas.<ref>Interview with former Tyler Police Chief Willie Hardy in 1991; https://www.truecrimetalestx.com/tyler-drug-scandal/ @16:34 of \"Part 1\"</ref><ref>''Rush'' by Kim Ramsey Wozencraft, Random House; 1st Edition, March 1990, with substantial source material also from the highly controversial book ''Smith County Justice'' by David Ellsworth, 1st Electronic Printing; Open Seas Press 1985.</ref>\n\n== Plot ==\nSeasoned [[undercover]] narcotics officer Jim Raynor is told by his superior, Lt. Dodd, to choose a partner from a group of recent [[police academy]] graduates for a planned undercover investigation. Raynor chooses the only woman applicant, Kristen Cates. Though uneasy, Dodd approves Raynor's choice.\n\nRaynor explains to Cates that they will be deep undercover, dependent on each other to try not to get killed during the investigation. Though initially startled by Raynor's intensity, Cates insists she is capable of doing whatever it takes to get the job done. Later at Raynor's apartment, he teaches Cates how to inject drugs, claiming that he is using a harmless powder for demonstration purposes. Raynor informs Cates that she will be put in situations where she will have to take the drugs in order to convince dealers she is not a cop. He insists that if she tries to fake drug use in front of dealers, she will get both of them killed.\n\nThe main target of the operation is a local bar owner and pornographer, Will Gaines. The chief of police insists that Gaines is the main drug boss in the town, but Gaines is deeply mistrustful of Raynor and Cates.\n\nAs Raynor predicted, Cates is put into a position where she is forced to inject drugs in front of a dealer. Over the course of the investigation, buying drugs all over town, Cates and Raynor begin using drugs for more reasons than maintaining their cover.\n\nThough they have successfully infiltrated the town's drug underworld, Raynor and Cates are unable to make a buy from Gaines. Under pressure from the chief and sergeant, they falsify evidence against Gaines in order to secure his arrest.\n\nThe night before Gaines trial is to begin, Cates is startled awake by a double barrel [[shotgun]] caressing her face. A gunfight ensues, in which Raynor is shot in the thigh, striking his [[femoral artery]]. Cates returns fire and runs to a neighbor's house shouting for help, then returns to the trailer to find Raynor barely conscious. He dies in her arms.\n\nAt the grand jury, Cates is on the witness stand. During her testimony, she mentions that she has resigned from the police force. Her testimony sticks to the fabricated story Raynor and she concocted. Gaines is later indicted. However, at trial, Cates takes the stand to testify. When she looks directly at Gaines, he slides two fingers down the bridge of his nose, mimicking the movement of the shotgun that eventually killed Raynor. Stunned, Cates retracts her statements about Gaines's involvement in the drug trade, and testifies that they were ordered to fabricate evidence by the Chief of Police. This secures Gaines's acquittal.\n\nFreed from police custody, Gaines gets into his car a few nights later. As he drives down the road, he notices someone hiding in the backseat. Gaines pulls over, and as he turns to confront them, he is killed by a double barrel shotgun blast to the face. The killer is never shown, but it is implied that it is Cates.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{Cast list|\n* [[Jason Patric]] as Detective Jim Raynor\n* [[Jennifer Jason Leigh]] as Detective Kristen Cates\n* [[Gregg Allman]] as Will Gaines\n* [[Sam Elliott]] as Captain Larry Dodd\n* [[Max Perlich]] as Walker\n* [[Tony Frank (actor)|Tony Frank]] as Chief Nettle\n* [[William Sadler (actor)|William Sadler]] as Monroe\n* Special K.
