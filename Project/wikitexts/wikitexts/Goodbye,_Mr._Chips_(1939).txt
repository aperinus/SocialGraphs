Based on the 1934 novella ''[[Goodbye, Mr. Chips]]'' by [[James Hilton (novelist)|James Hilton]], the film is about Mr. Chipping, a beloved aged school teacher and former headmaster of a boarding school, who recalls his career and his personal life over the decades.<ref>''[[Variety Film Reviews|Variety]]'' film review; 17 May 1939, page 12.</ref><ref>''[[Harrison's Reports and Film Reviews|Harrison's Reports]]'' film review; 17 June 1939, page 94.</ref> Produced for the British division of [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]] at [[Denham Studios]], the film was dedicated to [[Irving Thalberg]], who had died on 14 September 1936. At the [[12th Academy Awards]], it was nominated for seven awards, including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]]; and for his performance as Mr. Chipping, Donat won the award for [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]].\n\nAt the time of its release, the picture appeared on ''Film Daily''{{'}}s and the [[National Board of Review]]'s ten best lists for 1939, and received the \"best picture\" distinction in ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' Preview Poll of May 1939.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==Plot==\nDue to a [[common cold|cold]], retired schoolteacher Mr. Chipping misses a first-day assembly at Brookfield [[Public School (UK)|public school]] for the first time in 58 years. That afternoon, he falls asleep in his chair and his teaching career is related via [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]].\n\nWhen 25-year-old Charles Edward Chipping first arrives as a [[Latin]] teacher in 1870, he becomes a target of practical jokes on his first day. He reacts by imposing strict discipline in his classroom, making him disliked but respected. Twenty years pass and he becomes the senior master. He is disappointed in not receiving an appointment as a housemaster within the school for the following year. However, the new [[German language|German]] teacher, Max Staefel, saves him from despair by inviting him to share a walking holiday to his native [[Austria]].\n\nWhile mountain-climbing, Chipping encounters Kathy Ellis, a feisty English [[suffragette]] who is on a cycling holiday with a friend. They meet again in [[Vienna]], where she persuades him to dance to the [[Blue Danube Waltz]]. (This piece of music is used as a ''[[leitmotif]]'', symbolizing Chipping's love for her.) Staefel remarks that the Danube does not appear blue, but Chipping remarks it only appears so to those who are in love. On another part of the same boat, as Kathy looks at the river, she tells her friend that it is blue. Even though Kathy is considerably younger and livelier than Chipping, she loves and marries him. They return to England, where Kathy takes up residence at the school, charming everyone with her warmth.\n\nDuring their tragically short marriage (she dies in childbirth, along with their baby), she brings \"Chips\" out of his shell and shows him how to be a better teacher. He acquires a flair for [[Lex Canuleia|Latin puns]]. As the years pass, Chips becomes a much-loved school institution, developing a rapport with generations of pupils; he teaches the sons and grandsons of many of his earlier pupils.\n\nIn 1909, when he is pressured to retire by a more \"modern\" headmaster, the boys and the board of governors of the school take his side of the argument and tell him he can stay until he is 100, and that he is free to pronounce [[Cicero]] as SIS-er-ro, and not as KEE-kir-ro.\n\nChips finally retires in 1914 at the age of 69, saying, \"Haec olim meminisse iuvabit (One day, we'll look back on this and smile)\", but is summoned back to serve as interim headmaster because of the shortage of teachers resulting from [[World War I|the First World War]]. He remembers Kathy had predicted he would become headmaster one day. During a bombing attack by a German [[Zeppelin]], Chips insists that the boys keep on translating their Latin, choosing the story of [[Julius Caesar]]'s battles against Germanic tribes, which describes the latter's belligerent nature, much to the amusement of his pupils. As the Great War drags on, Chips reads aloud into the school's [[War memorial|Roll of Honour]] every Sunday the names of the many former boys and teachers who have died in the war. Upon discovering that Max Staefel has died fighting on the German side, Chips reads out his name in chapel, too.\n\nHe retires permanently in 1918, but continues living nearby. He is on his deathbed in 1933 when he overhears his colleagues talking about him. He responds, \"I thought I heard you say it was a pity\u2014pity I never had any children. But you're wrong. I have! Thousands of them, thousands of them...and all...boys.\"\n\n==Time discrepancy==\nThe film does not follow the same timeframe as the novel. In the book, Mr. Chipping is 22 when he arrives at Brookfield, with a birth year of 1848, and 85 when he dies, in 1933. His age when he first comes to Brookfield is not stated in the film, but the [[Franco-Prussian War]] is under way, which sets the date of his arrival in September 1870. He retires at age 69 in 1914, making his birth year 1845, so in the film he arrives at Brookfield in 1870 at age 24 or 25. He develops the cold and misses assembly\u2014and dies soon afterwards\u2014at age 83, which must be in 1928. This also fits with his 58-year record for attendance beginning on the day he arrived: 1870\u20131928. The evidence in the film that the year of his death is 1933 comes from Chips saying to a new pupil at the start of the film that he has not taught in 15 years. Likewise, he says to young Colley that he has been teaching for 63 years, meaning he would have arrived at age 20, which is impossible given his credentials.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Garson-Donat-Goodbye-Mr-Chips.jpg|thumb|Promotional photograph of Greer Garson and Robert Donat in ''Goodbye, Mr. Chips'']]\n{{castlist|\n* [[Robert Donat]] as [[Mr. Chips]] [[Master of Arts|M.A.]] ([[Cantab.]]). The 34-year-old Donat begins playing a man 10 years younger than himself and ages over the course of the film to the mid-80s. He remarked: \"As soon as I put the moustache on, I felt the part, even if I did look like a great [[Airedale terrier|airedale]] come out of a puddle.\"{{citation needed|date=June 2022}}\n* [[Greer Garson]] as Katherine.
