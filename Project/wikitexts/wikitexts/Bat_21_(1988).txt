Anderson]], novelist and retired [[United States Air Force]] [[Colonel (United States)|colonel]].<ref>Anderson 1980, Cover.</ref>{{#tag:ref|''BAT-21: Based on the true story of Lieutenant Colonel Iceal E. Hambleton, USAF'' was also published as ''Bat-21'' and ''Bat-21: Sam on the Scope''; also released as an Ebook.|group=Note}} Set during the [[Vietnam War]], the film is a dramatization based upon the rescue of a U.S. [[Electronic Warfare Officer|air navigator]] shot down behind enemy lines in [[Vietnam]]. The film stars [[Gene Hackman]] and [[Danny Glover]] with [[Jerry Reed]], [[David Marshall Grant]], [[Clayton Rohner]], [[Erich Anderson]] and Joe Dorsey in supporting roles.\n\n==Plot==\nDuring the last days of the Vietnam War, [[United States Air Force|USAF]] [[Lieutenant colonel (United States)|Lieutenant colonel]] [[Iceal Hambleton|Iceal E. \"Gene\" Hambleton]] ([[Gene Hackman]]) call sign BAT-21 Bravo, is flying on board an [[Douglas B-66 Destroyer|EB-66C]] electronic warfare aircraft, engaged in electronic countermeasures preparatory to a major bombing strike. Without warning, a number of [[S-75 Dvina|SA-2 Guideline]] [[Surface-to-air missile|SAM]]s are launched from North Vietnam, targeting their aircraft. A massive SAM explosion tears off the tail and Hambleton, in the navigator's position, ejects as the sole survivor of the six-man crew.\n\nWhile still coming down by parachute, Hambleton makes radio contact with Captain Bartholomew \"Birddog\" Clark ([[Danny Glover]]), the pilot of a [[Cessna O-2 Skymaster]], flying a [[forward air control]] mission near where the EB-66 was destroyed. Birddog becomes Hambleton's link to rescue.\n\nHambleton, an expert on electronic weapons systems and who holds valuable information, is known to the North Vietnamese, who begin an all-out search, attempting to capture him. An effort to steal supplies from Vietnamese villagers is not successful, as Hambleton is discovered and kills an aggressive peasant farmer, apologizing to his grieving family as he escapes.\n\nKnowing that his current location is too dangerous for rescue aircraft, Hambleton devises a plan to reach safer territory. He plots a course to the river which is the boundary of the target area, then communicates his intended path to Clark in a code composed of various golf courses he knows well. This will allow the rescuers to keep track of his progress, making it easier for them to pick him up.\n\nSeveral attempts are made to recover Hambleton. Two helicopters are lost and members of its crews are killed or captured. Clark ultimately flies a [[Bell UH-1 Iroquois|\"Huey\"]] helicopter rescue mission, but as he retrieves Hambleton, the pair are shot down by ground fire, with Clark being wounded. An [[North American F-100 Super Sabre|F-100]] bombing raid both assists and hinders their progress through the jungle, as North Vietnamese irregulars are trailing them. In the end, Hambleton and Clark are rescued by a US [[Patrol Boat, River|river boat]] patrolling nearby on the [[Cam Lo River]].\n\n===Historical accuracy===\n{{main|Rescue of Bat 21 Bravo}}\nPortions of ''Bat*21'' were highly dramatized, including the climactic battle. Some characters were composites of real people, while others were created for the film. However, some other details were accurate, including that rescuer Captain Larry Potts was [[African American]].<ref>[http://airforce.togetherweserved.com/usaf/servlet/tws.webapp.WebApp?cmd=ShadowBoxProfile&type=Person&ID=81801 \"Walker, Bruce Charles (FAC-POW/MIA), Capt.\"] ''TogetherWeServe.com''.

A Forward Air Observer aircraft was shot down and USAF 1Lt Bruce Walker and USMC 1Lt Larry Potts parachuted to the ground safely, eluding capture. In an ensuing attack, six more Americans lost their lives attempting to rescue him. The North Vietnamese, alerted by the intense efforts to find the flyer, increased their efforts to find Hambleton. Walker was discovered and killed by the Vietnamese forces. During a covert nighttime operation more than {{convert|2|mi}} behind enemy lines, Hambleton was finally rescued in a land operation by [[United States Navy SEALs|U.S. Navy SEAL]] Lt. j.g. [[Thomas R. Norris]] and [[Republic of Vietnam Navy|VNN]] Petty Officer Third Class [[Nguyen Van Kiet]].<ref>Cutler, Thomas J.
