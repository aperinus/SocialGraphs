The film follows a group of intellectual friends from the [[Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al]] history department as they engage in a long dialogue about their sexual affairs, touching on issues of [[adultery]], [[homosexuality]], [[group sex]], [[BDSM]] and [[prostitution]]. A number of characters associate self-indulgence with societal decline.\n\nThe film was a box office success in Canada and internationally and received good reviews. It won the [[International Federation of Film Critics|FIPRESCI Prize]] at the [[Cannes Film Festival]], nine [[Genie Awards]], including [[Canadian Screen Award for Best Motion Picture|Best Motion Picture]], and was the first Canadian film nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film]]. It was followed by two sequels, ''[[The Barbarian Invasions]]'' in 2003 and ''[[Days of Darkness (2007 Canadian film)|Days of Darkness]]'' in 2007.\n\n==Plot==\nIn an interview with [[CBC Radio]], [[Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al]] History Professor Dominique St. Arnaud tells Diane about her new book, ''Variations on the Idea of Happiness'', which discusses her thesis that modern society's fixation on self-indulgence is indicative of its decline, predicting a collapse in the \"[[American imperialism|American Empire]]\", of which [[Quebec]] is on the periphery. Several of Dominique and Diane's friends, mostly intellectual history professors at the university, prepare for a dinner later in the day, with the men at work in the kitchen while the women work out at the gym.\n\nAs the dinner draws nearer, the men and women mainly talk about their sex lives, with the men being open about their [[adultery|adulteries]], including R\u00e9my, who is married to Louise. Most of the women in the circle of friends have had sex with R\u00e9my, though he is not attractive, but they conceal this from Louise to spare her feelings. Louise has been to an [[orgy]] with R\u00e9my, but believes he is generally faithful to her in Montreal. The friends are also accepting of their homosexual friend Claude, who speaks about pursuing men reckless of fear of [[Sexually transmitted infection|STD]]s, while secretly being fearful of having one. During the dinner party, the friends listen to Dominique's theories about the decline of society, with Louise expressing skepticism. To retaliate against Louise, Dominique reveals she has had sex with R\u00e9my and their friend Pierre, causing her to have an emotional meltdown. By morning, relationships have gone back to normal.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[R\u00e9my Girard]] as R\u00e9my\n* [[Dominique Michel]] as Dominique\n* [[Doroth\u00e9e Berryman]] as Louise\n* [[Louise Portal]] as Diane\n* [[Pierre Curzi]] as Pierre\n* [[Yves Jacques]] as Claude\n* [[Genevi\u00e8ve Rioux]] as Danielle\n* [[Daniel Bri\u00e8re (actor)|Daniel Bri\u00e8re]] as Alain\n* [[Gabriel Arcand]] as Mario\n* Ariane Fr\u00e9d\u00e9rique as Nathalie.{{sfn|Loiselle|2008|p=67}}\n}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\n[[File:DenysArcand07TIFF.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Director [[Denys Arcand]] wrote the script influenced by a small budget and seeing an interest in personal pleasures as becoming predominant in society.]]\nIn the wake of the [[1980 Quebec referendum]], director [[Denys Arcand]] felt Quebec's interests had shifted from politics to \"individual pleasures\", and with a small budget of $800,000 for his next project, envisioned a dialogue-heavy film like [[Louis Malle]]'s 1981 film ''[[My Dinner with Andre]]''. Arcand viewed sex as the most likely topic that could sustain audience interest for an entire film.{{sfn|Loiselle|2008|p=17}} He worked on the screenplay throughout the summer of 1984, under the working title ''Conversations scabreuses''.{{sfn|Loiselle|2008|p=17}} He chose tenured university professors as his subject matter because he felt that such people had less of a Quebecois accent, which would make the film more accessible to French-speaking audiences around the world. He avoided naming local places for the same reason, even though this went against the wishes of the [[National Film Board of Canada]], which co-sponsored the film.{{sfn|Pike|2012|p=93}}\n\nAs Arcand worked on the script, producer [[Roger Frappier]] saw the story as promising and lobbied [[Ren\u00e9 Malo]] to co-produce, allowing for a bigger budget.{{sfn|Loiselle|2008|p=21}} Frappier and Malo raised $1.8 million, allowing for more settings depicted in the film.{{sfn|Loiselle|2008|p=22}} Most of the funding came from the governments of Canada and Quebec.{{sfn|Melnyk|2004|p=140}}\n\nArcand had [[R\u00e9my Girard]] and [[Yves Jacques]] in mind for principal roles after working with them on ''[[The Crime of Ovide Plouffe]] (Le Crime d'Ovide Plouffe)'' (1984), and named the main character R\u00e9my after Girard. Nevertheless, their lack of celebrity meant Girard had to audition for the part named for him, to satisfy producers.{{sfn|Loiselle|2008|p=22}}\n\n===Filming===\n[[File:Lake_Memphremagog.JPG|thumb|left|150px|Filming took place near [[Lake Memphremagog]] in Quebec from September to October 1985.]]\nFilming began in [[Montreal]] in August 1985, and moved to [[Lake Memphremagog]] in September, finishing in October.{{sfn|Loiselle|2008|p=23}} Filmmaker [[Jacques Leduc]] is given credit for photographing the nature scenes in the film.{{sfn|Harcourt|2006|p=150}}\n\nIn filming [[Sex in film|sex scenes]], Arcand felt visual depictions were overused, which is why he focused on the verbal aspect.
