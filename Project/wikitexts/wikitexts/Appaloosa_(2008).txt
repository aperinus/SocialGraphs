Parker]]. Directed by [[Ed Harris]] and co-written by Harris and Robert Knott, ''Appaloosa'' stars Harris alongside [[Viggo Mortensen]], [[Ren\u00e9e Zellweger]] and [[Jeremy Irons]]. The film premiered at [[2008 Toronto International Film Festival]] and was released in selected cities on September 19, 2008, then expanded into wide-release on October 3, 2008.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1882, the small town of Appaloosa, [[New Mexico]], is being terrorized by local rancher Randall Bragg, who killed the town's marshal, Jack Bell, and two deputies when they came to Bragg's ranch to arrest two men. The town hires [[Law enforcement officer|lawman]] and peacekeeper Virgil Cole and his [[Deputy sheriff|deputy]] Everett Hitch to protect and regain control of the town. The pair agrees on one condition: that the town follow Cole's law and essentially cede control to him. The lawmen begin by confronting four of Bragg's men who are causing a disturbance in the saloon. Three men refuse to allow themselves to be arrested, forcing Cole and Hitch to kill them. The fourth man surrenders and leaves the saloon. Bragg has a meeting with Cole and Hitch, initiating a standoff.\n\nHitch sees a woman, Allison \"Allie\" French, a young widow, who just came to the town and immediately takes an interest in her. He follows her to the diner where Cole is having a breakfast. They make acquaintance with her and observing Cole and Allie are getting together well, Hitch keeps his silence. Soon, Cole and Allie begin a romantic relationship and buy a house together. However, Allie attempts to seduce Hitch when they are alone but Hitch refuses her advances out of his loyalty to Cole.\n\nWhen one of Bragg's men tells Cole and Hitch that he will testify against Bragg on the triple murder case, they arrest Bragg and keep him locked up until the trial in spite of the attempts of Bragg's gang to free him. The trial finds him guilty and sentences him to death. Cole and Hitch are joined by Sheriff Clyde Stringer and a deputy before transporting Bragg via train to the prison where he is to be hanged. When the engine makes a water stop over a bridge, hired guns Ring and Mackie Shelton, old acquaintances of Cole, appear with Allie as a hostage. At gunpoint, they force Cole to release Bragg to them.\n\nCole and Hitch catch up with the outlaws and see Allie and Ring Shelton frolicking naked together in a stream. When the outlaws are attacked by [[Chiricahua Apache]], Cole and Hitch force the Native Americans away. Hitch tells Cole that Allie's promiscuity is the result of her insecurity and she really likes Cole. They then turn Bragg over to the sheriff of Beauville; unbeknownst to Cole, the sheriff is a cousin of the Shelton brothers. Knowing that Cole is determined to bring Bragg to the gallows, the Sheltons and the sheriff free Bragg and engage Cole and Hitch in a gunfight. Cole and Hitch are wounded but manage to kill Ring, Mackie and the sheriff. Bragg escapes on horseback and Cole and Hitch return to Appaloosa with Allie.\n\nAfter some time, Bragg is granted a full pardon by President [[Chester Arthur]] (whom he previously claimed to have known) and returns to Appaloosa in an attempt to publicly reform himself. He buys the hotel and ingratiates himself with the locals. Privately he brags before Cole and Hitch to infuriate them over their failure to hang him. Cole tells Hitch that he still wants to be with Allie, despite her fickleness. Hitch decides to leave the town to make some money and resigns as deputy. Later he discovers that Allie is having a relationship with Bragg and challenges Bragg to a duel. Cole attempts to stop him, but Hitch remains steadfast and asks Cole to permit the gunfight to occur. Hitch manages to fire first, hitting Bragg in the chest, killing him. Hitch leaves town, seeing that Allie and Cole are together; his parting thoughts express his hope that Cole can find happiness with Allie and for him, he gladly walks into uncertainty in hope of finding adventure and fortune.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Ed Harris]] as Virgil Cole\n* [[Viggo Mortensen]] as Everett Hitch\n* [[Ren\u00e9e Zellweger]] as Allie French\n* [[Jeremy Irons]] as Randall Bragg\n* [[Lance Henriksen]] as Ring Shelton\n* Adam Nelson as Mackie Shelton\n* [[Timothy Spall]] as Phil Olson\n* [[Ariadna Gil]] as Katie\n* [[James Gammon]] as Earl May\n* [[Tom Bower (actor)|Tom Bower]] as Abner Raines\n* [[Rex Linn]] as Sheriff Clyde Stringer\n* Corby Griesenbeck as Deputy Charlie Tewksbury\n* Timothy V.
