At an early age he had become interested in [[martial arts]], and moved to Japan to study them. In 1969, Toscani was recruited to join the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] by Nelson Fox and was involved in covert operations on the Vietnamese-Cambodian border during the [[Vietnam War]]. There, he became disgusted with DCI Kurt Zagon, who tortured prisoners. A stand-off occurred when Toscani tried to stop a torture session, and he left the CIA. Toscani returned to Chicago, joined the police department, and got married.\n\nToscani and his new partner Detective Delores \"Jacks\" Jackson are investigating a drug ring, and after busting two of the dealers, including Salvadorian drug lord Tony Salvano, Toscani finds [[C-4 (explosive)|C-4]] explosive. Shortly afterward, the men that Toscani and Jackson arrested are released at the request of federal officials, and Toscani is ordered to stand down. Later, the priest of Toscani's parish is killed in an explosion during Mass. Fox calls Toscani and tells him to move his family to a safer location, saying that he is in danger. Under pressure from the feds, Toscani is asked to turn in his badge. He eventually discovers that the dealers he busted are linked to Zagon, who is still with the CIA, and who is being accused of human rights violations by a Central American priest who was being sheltered by Toscani's priest. While Zagon is torturing the priest, Toscani bursts in and a gun battle ensues. Detectives Lukich and Jackson are wounded during the shootout, and Toscani has to flee.\n\nSenator Ernest Harrison is investigating Zagon's group to reveal their covert operations and drug dealing. When Toscani finds out that Zagon killed the priest and is planning to kill Harrison, he goes after Zagon. Toscani confronts Fox, but they are interrupted by Zagon's men. Fox is killed and Toscani is captured. He is held in the kitchen of a hotel during a Harrison campaign rally. Before Zagon can kill Harrison, Toscani breaks free and kills Zagon and all of his remaining men. Afterwards, Toscani meets Harrison, who has been informed of everything.\n\nHarrison promises justice and Toscani says he is now willing to testify about his experiences with Zagon and covert operations in the CIA.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Steven Seagal]] as Sergeant Nicolo \"Nico\" Toscani\n* [[Pam Grier]] as Detective Delores \"Jacks\" Jackson\n* [[Henry Silva]] as CIA Agent Kurt Zagon\n* [[Ron Dean]] as Detective Lukich\n* [[Sharon Stone]] as Sara Toscani\n* [[Gene Barge]] as Detective Henderson\n* [[Chelcie Ross]] as CIA Agent Nelson Fox\n* [[Ronnie Barron]] as CIA Bartender\n* Nicholas Kusenko as FBI Agent Neeley\n* [[Gregory Alan Williams]] as FBI Agent Halloran\n* [[Jack Wallace (actor)|Jack Wallace]] as Uncle Branca\n* Metta Davis as Rosa Toscani\n* Toni Fleming as Grandma Zingaro\n* Michelle Hoard as Lucy, Nico's Cousin\n* Christopher Peditto as Alex, The Pimp\n* Cheryl Hamada as Watanabe\n* [[Ralph Foody]] as Federal Clerk\n* Joseph Kosala as Lieutenant Fred Strozah\n* [[Thalmus Rasulala]] as Deputy Superintendent Crowder\n* Joe Greco as Father Joseph Gennaro\n* [[Henry Godinez]] as Father Tomasino\n* India Cooper as Sister Mary\n* Joe D.
