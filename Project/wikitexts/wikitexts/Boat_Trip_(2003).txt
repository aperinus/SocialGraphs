Fox]], [[Roselyn S\u00e1nchez]], and [[Roger Moore]]. The film was released in the United States on March 21, 2003, and was a major critical and commercial failure.\n\n== Plot ==\nJerry ([[Cuba Gooding Jr.]]) and Nick ([[Horatio Sanz]]) are two close friends whose love lives have hit rock bottom. Jerry's girlfriend Felicia ([[Vivica A. Fox]]) has turned down his marriage proposal after vomiting all over her during a hot air balloon ride during the proposal. After Nick runs into a friend who is marrying a beautiful, younger girl he met on a singles cruise, he decides to take a similar cruise with Jerry.\n\nWhile on their way to the travel agency, they get into a verbal altercation with a gay man who works at the agency they plan to book the cruise through. The manager ([[Will Ferrell]]) attempts to patch things up by handling their booking personally. To Jerry and Nick, the situation appears to be handled well and they leave, not expecting anything to go wrong. After they leave, it is revealed that the agent and manager, both men, are actually gay lovers, and that they have been booked on a cruise for gay men.\n\nDuring their trip, they come to learn that gay men are less objectionable than they first assumed. However, Jerry falls in love with the cruise's dance instructor Gabriella ([[Roselyn S\u00e1nchez]]) and in order to win her over, he pretends to be gay so he can get closer to her. Meanwhile, Nick blossoms a romance with a bikini model named Inga ([[Victoria Silvstedt]]). After an accidental affair with her mean, sex-obsessed coach Sonya ([[Lin Shaye]]), Nick must fend her off, after she has fallen in love with him as well.\n\nIn the end, Jerry wins Gabriella while Nick loses out on Inga but sees a potential relationship with her sister instead. However, he is then unwittingly (and unwillingly) reunited with Sonya; much to his disgust and her instant [[Sexual arousal|arousal]] upon seeing him.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Cuba Gooding Jr.]] as Jerry Robinson\n* [[Horatio Sanz]] as Nick Ragoni\n* [[Roselyn S\u00e1nchez]] as Gabriella\n* [[Vivica A.
