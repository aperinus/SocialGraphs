Directed by [[Steven Spielberg]] from a screenplay by [[Zak Penn]] and Cline, it stars [[Tye Sheridan]], [[Olivia Cooke]], [[Ben Mendelsohn]], [[Lena Waithe]], [[T.J. Miller]], [[Simon Pegg]], and [[Mark Rylance]]. The film is set in 2045, where much of humanity uses the OASIS, a [[virtual reality]] simulation, to escape the real world. A teenage orphan finds clues to a contest that promises the ownership of the OASIS to the winner, and he and his allies try to complete it before an evil corporation can do so.\n\nDevelopment of the film first began in 2010 when [[Warner Bros.]] acquired the rights to the book. In July 2015, Spielberg signed on to direct and produce the film, with casting commencing in September 2015. Filming began in England in June 2016 and was completed in September that year. The visual effects were handled by [[Industrial Light & Magic]], [[Digital Domain]], and [[Territory Studio]], with some pre-visualization work done by [[The Third Floor, Inc.|The Third Floor]]. As with the novel, many popular culture references appear throughout the film, including references to ''[[The Shining (film)|The Shining]]'', the [[Back to the Future (franchise)|''Back to the Future'' franchise]], and ''[[The Iron Giant]].''\n\n''Ready Player One'' premiered at [[South by Southwest]] in Austin, Texas on March 11, 2018, and was theatrically released by Warner Bros. Pictures in the United States on March 29, 2018. The film received mostly positive reviews from critics, who praised Spielberg's direction, the visual effects, brisk pacing, and the performances of both Sheridan and Rylance.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://uploadvr.com/ready-player-one-movie-review-roundup-another-spielberg-classic/|title=Ready Player One Movie Review Roundup: Another Spielberg Classic?|first1=David |last1=Jagneaux|work=[[UploadVR]]|date=March 13, 2018|access-date=March 26, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.tomsguide.com/us/ready-player-one-review-roundup,news-26776.html|title=Ready Player One Review Roundup: Pretty, Flawed|first1=Henry T. |last1=Casey|work=Tom\u2019s Guide|date=March 14, 2018|access-date=March 26, 2018}}</ref> It grossed around $583 million worldwide, and earned a nomination for Best Visual Effects at the [[91st Academy Awards]], [[24th Critics' Choice Awards]], and [[72nd British Academy Film Awards]].

A sequel is in development.\n\n== Plot ==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 to 700 words. Please check the word count before making any additions. -->\nIn a dystopian 2045, people seek to escape from reality through the [[virtual reality]] entertainment universe called the OASIS (Ontologically Anthropocentric Sensory Immersive Simulation), created by James Halliday and Ogden Morrow of Gregarious Games. After Halliday's death, a pre-recorded message left by his avatar Anorak announces a game, granting ownership of the OASIS to the first to find the golden [[Easter egg (media)|Easter egg]] within it, which gets locked behind a gate requiring three keys which players can obtain by accomplishing three challenges. The contest has lured several \"Gunters\", or egg hunters, and the interest of Nolan Sorrento, the [[Chief executive officer|CEO]] of Innovative Online Industries (IOI) who seeks to control the OASIS himself by inserting intrusive online advertising. IOI uses an army of [[indentured servants]], and employees called \"Sixers\" to find the egg.\n\nTeenage orphan Wade Watts' avatar Parzival, an avid Gunter, participates in the first challenge, an unbeatable race, along with his best friend Aech, and Art3mis, a female avatar on whom Parzival [[Crush (psychology)|has a crush]]. Parzival regularly visits Halliday's Journals, a simulated archive of Halliday's life and hobbies, run by the Curator. Wade receives the Copper Key from Anorak after he wins by driving backward, while Art3mis, Aech, and his friends Daito and Sho, all win the race afterward, later being collectively named the High-5 on the OASIS' [[scoreboard]].\n\nSorrento asks mercenary i-R0k to learn Wade's true identity, intending to bribe him to win the contest on IOI's behalf. Wade and Art3mis discover from the Journals that Halliday once dated Morrow's wife Karen \"Kira\" Underwood. Wade and Art3mis visit the Distracted Globe [[night club]] to look for clues, where Wade confesses his love and true name to Art3mis. They survive an IOI raid in which Art3mis abandons Wade, explaining that her father died in debt to IOI. i-R0k, who was eavesdropping on their conversation, informs Sorrento of his findings. Sorrento contacts Wade with his offer. When rejected, Sorrento attempts to dispose of Wade by bombing his home, killing his aunt Alice and her boyfriend Rick among others. Art3mis' player Samantha Cook takes Wade in. Together, they realize the second challenge relates to Halliday's regret of not pursuing a relationship with Kira. Along with Aech, Daito, and Sho, Parzival and Art3mis search for the recreation of the [[Overlook Hotel]]. Art3mis asks Kira to dance and wins the Jade Key. Sorrento's subordinate F'Nale Zandor storms the Gunters' hideout, taking Samantha to an IOI Loyalty Center to pay off her father's debt. Wade escapes with the help of the other High-5 users, Helen Harris (Aech), Toshiro (Daito), and Zhou (Sho) in Helen's truck. Samantha escapes confinement after Aech and Parzival hack Sorrento's OASIS rig.\n\nThe third challenge is found in Castle Anorak on [[Voltron|Planet Doom]], where players must guess Halliday's favorite [[Atari 2600]] game to earn the Crystal Key. i-R0k places a forcefield around the castle using the Orb of Osuvox, but Art3mis soon disables it. The High-5 lead an army of OASIS players against IOI's forces. Parzival kills Samantha's avatar, allowing her to flee IOI with the High-5 picking her up nearby.  Parzival and Sorrento fight in the OASIS with Sorrento detonating the [[Doomsday device|Cataclyst bomb]], wiping out every avatar on [[Planet Doom]] including himself. Parzival survives using an [[extra life]] coin given to him earlier by the Curator in a bet. He plays ''[[Adventure (1980 video game)|Adventure]]'', winning the Crystal Key by locating [[Warren Robinett]]'s [[Adventure (1980 video game)#Easter egg|Easter egg]]. He uses the three keys to enter a treasure room, where Anorak offers him a contract to sign. Parzival recognizes it as the one Morrow signed when Halliday forced him out of Gregarious Games and refuses to sign it. Anorak transforms into Halliday, who expresses his regrets in life and awards Parzival the Easter egg.\n\nOgden Morrow appears, revealing that he is the Curator. Wade decides to run the OASIS with the High-5, inviting Morrow to join them as a consultant. After Aech sends the police a copy of Sorento confessing to the bombing, he and F'Nale are arrested. As the IOI Loyalty Centers are shut down, the High-5 make the controversial choice to close the OASIS every Tuesday and Thursday for people to spend more time in the real world, including Wade and Samantha, who start a relationship.\n\n== Cast ==\n<!--In order of end credits-->\n* [[Tye Sheridan]] as Wade Watts / Parzival<ref name=\"SheridanCast\">{{cite news|url=https://collider.com/ready-player-one-movie-tye-sheridan-steven-spielberg/|title=Tye Sheridan Lands Lead in Steven Spielberg's 'Ready Player One'|work=[[Collider (website)|Collider]]|publisher=[[Complex (magazine)|Complex Media]]|last=Chitwood|first=Adam|date=February 24, 2016|access-date=March 23, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170725230458/http://collider.com/ready-player-one-movie-tye-sheridan-steven-spielberg|archive-date=July 25, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n* [[Olivia Cooke]] as Samantha Cooke / Art3mis<ref name=\"CookeLead\">{{cite web |last1=Kit |first1=Borys |title=Steven Spielberg's 'Ready Player One' Finds Female Lead in Olivia Cooke (Exclusive) |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/steven-spielbergs-ready-player-one-finds-female-lead-olivia-cooke-821728 |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |date=September 11, 2015 |access-date=May 7, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200108080955/https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/steven-spielbergs-ready-player-one-finds-female-lead-olivia-cooke-821728 |archive-date=January 8, 2020 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n* [[Ben Mendelsohn]] as Nolan Sorrento / IOI-655321<ref name=\"Jan2016THR\">{{cite news|last1=Kit|first1=Borys|title=Ben Mendelsohn Eyed for Villain Role in Steven Spielberg's 'Ready Player One' (Exclusive)|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/ben-mendelsohn-eyed-villain-role-852265|access-date=January 7, 2016|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|publisher=[[Prometheus Global Media]]|date=January 6, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160109130640/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/ben-mendelsohn-eyed-villain-role-852265|archive-date=January 9, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>\n* [[Lena Waithe]] as Helen Harris / Aech<ref name=\"RPOEW\">{{cite magazine|url=https://ew.com/movies/2017/07/14/ready-player-one-first-look-photo/|title=See an exclusive first look at Steven Spielberg's Ready Player One|magazine=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|access-date=March 23, 2018|last=Breznican|first=Anthony|author-link=Anthony Breznican|date=July 14, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170717050656/http://ew.com/movies/2017/07/14/ready-player-one-first-look-photo/|archive-date=July 17, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n* [[T.J.
