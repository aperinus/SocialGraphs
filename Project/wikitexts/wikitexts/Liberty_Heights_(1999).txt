The film is a semi-autobiographical account of his childhood growing up in [[Baltimore]] in the 1950s. Portrayed are the racial injustices experienced both by the Jewish and African-American populations. Both of Nate Kurtzman's sons find women 'prohibited' to them, in Van's case because he's Jewish, for Ben the main issue is being white. Their father goes to prison for running a burlesque show with Little Melvin, an African-American, and a known local drug dealer.\n\nIt is the fourth of Levinson's [[tetralogy]] \"Baltimore Films\", set in his hometown during the 1940s, 1950s, and 1960s: ''[[Diner (1982 film)|Diner]]'' (1982), ''[[Tin Men]]'' (1987) and ''[[Avalon (1990 film)|Avalon]]'' (1990).<ref name=NYT2>{{cite web|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=November 14, 1999|title=Barry Levinson: Baltimore, My Baltimore|author=Levinson, Barry|authorlink=Barry Levinson|url=https://partners.nytimes.com/library/film/111499levinson-film.html}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nIn the fall of 1954, the Kurtzmans, a [[American Jews|Jewish]] family, live in [[Forest Park, Baltimore|Forest Park]], a suburban neighborhood in northwest [[Baltimore]]. Nate, the father, runs a [[burlesque]] theater, and engages in a [[Numbers game|numbers racket]]. His wife Ada is a housewife. Van, the older son, attends the [[University of Baltimore]], and Ben is in his senior year in high school.\n\nBen meets Sylvia, an [[African Americans|African-American]] girl, who begins attending his school after the district has been [[Racial integration|integrated]]. Ben immediately starts to develop feelings towards Sylvia, and introduces himself. They become close based on a mutual love for [[Little Richard]], [[James Brown]], [[jazz]], and black comedians. Sylvia's father, an affluent doctor, disapproves of their relationship and forbids them to see one another.\n\nOn [[Halloween]], Ben dresses up as [[Adolf Hitler]], which shocks his parents greatly, and he's forbidden to go in public wearing it. Van and his friends head over to a party in a predominantly bourgeois, [[gentile]] section of town. He is attracted to a mysterious blonde woman. A fight between one of Van's buddies and a gentile erupts over his jewishness and Trey, one of the party-goers, drunkenly crashes his car into the house. Van must leave the mystery woman.\n\nTrey goes to court for the car crash. Van and his friends are there as witnesses, but they find ways to avoid testifying against him. After the hearing is over, Van asks several of the other party attendants about the blonde woman he met. Trey discovers that the girl Van has fallen in love with is Dubbie, Trey's own girlfriend.\n\nMeanwhile, Nate's burlesque theatre has problems. In order to boost returns on the numbers game, an additional bonus number is added that will increase the pay-off. Little Melvin, a local drug dealer, makes a large bet, defies expectations, and hits the number. Unable to pay on such a big win, Nate is forced to cut Melvin a 'slice of the pie'. When Nate offers Melvin the numbers business instead, Melvin claims that Nate is trying to \"Jew\" him out of his money, and a fight breaks out between their bodyguards.\n\nSylvia gives Ben tickets to see [[James Brown (musician)|James Brown]] & [[The Famous Flames]] in concert. There, Ben and his friend are the only white patrons in the audience. Van and his friends head out to a gathering, where he again runs into Dubbie and learns she is with Trey.\n\nLittle Melvin spots Nate's car off of Pennsylvania Avenue in the [[African-American neighborhood]] where James Brown is performing, and after seeing Ben and his friend inside, deduces that one of them must be Nate's son. After the concert, Melvin abducts Ben, Sylvia, and their friends in a payback to Nate's racket.\n\nVan discovers Trey is in surgery after a car accident. He and Dubbie go see him in Virginia. Trey breaks up with her, and on their way back to Maryland, she suggests they stop in a motel. She gets quite drunk, bursts into tears, and then Van realizes  she doesn't really want to be with him.\n\nNate and his associates from the nightclub are charged and booked with [[prostitution]] and [[Racket (crime)|racketeering]]. Before leaving for prison, Nate manages to attend Ben and Sylvia's high school graduation. She is attending [[Spelman College]] in [[Atlanta]]; he is staying to attend the [[University of Maryland, College Park|University of Maryland]]. As they say goodbye, he steals a kiss, shocking both families\n\nBen's family is attending a Jewish ceremony as Nate walks out of the [[synagogue]] and blows a goodbye kiss to his wife.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Adrien Brody]] as Van\n* [[Ben Foster (actor)|Ben Foster]] as Ben\n* [[Orlando Jones]] as Little Melvin\n* [[Bebe Neuwirth]] as Ada\n* [[Joe Mantegna]] as Nate\n* [[Rebekah Johnson]] as Sylvia\n* [[Gerry Rosenthal]] as Murray\n* [[David Krumholtz]] as Yussel\n* [[Justin Chambers]] as Trey\n* [[Carolyn Murphy]] as Dubbie\n* [[Kevin Sussman]] as Alan\n* [[Shane West]] as Ted\n* [[Anthony Anderson]] as Scribbles\n* [[Elizabeth Ann Bennett]] as Mary\n* Carlton J.
