It follows the lives of two close childhood friends, a boy and a girl, who get separated once the girl is sent into space to fight in a war against aliens. As the 15-year-old girl goes deeper and deeper into space, the texts she sends take longer to reach the Earth; the film [[Nonlinear narrative|simultaneously follows]] her battles and the boy's life as he receives her texts over the years.\n\nThe OVA premiered in Japan in February 2002 in an advance screening. It was followed by two DVD releases on April 19 and October 6, 2002. [[A.D. Vision#ADV Films|ADV Films]] licensed the OVA for release in North America and the United Kingdom, [[Madman Entertainment]] licensed it for Australasia, and Anime Limited licensed it for the United Kingdom. In 2002, it won the [[Animation Kobe]] award for packaged work. It also won the 2003 [[Seiun Award]] for Best Media. It was very positively received by critics, who praised its artistic dimension, plot, and music; the English-language version, however was criticized for its dubbing.\n\nThe OVA was adapted into a [[Radio drama in Japan|drama CD]] by [[Geneon Universal Entertainment|Pioneer LDC]] and a novel was written by Waku \u014cba, illustrated by Makoto Shinkai and [[Kou Yaginuma]], and published by [[Media Factory]]'s imprint [[MF Bunko J]].  Makoto Shinkai adapted a [[manga]] from the OVA, illustrated by [[Sumomo Yumeka|Mizu Sahara]]; [[Kodansha]] serialized it in its manga magazine, ''[[Monthly Afternoon|Afternoon]]'', from April 2004, and released the manga as a [[One-shot (comics)|one-shot]] on February 23, 2005. The manga was licensed for a North American release by [[Tokyopop]], which published it on August 1, 2006.\n\n==Plot==\nA schoolgirl named Mikako Nagamine (Mika Shinohara (original Japanese),<ref name=\"Details\" /> Sumi Muto (Japanese),<ref name=\"ADV Char\" /> Cynthia Martinez (English)<ref name=\"ADV Char\" />) is recruited into the UN Space Army to fight in a war against a group of [[Extraterrestrial life|aliens]] called the Tarsians{{mdash}}named after the [[Tharsis]] region of Mars where they were first encountered.  As a Special Agent, Mikako pilots a giant robotic [[mecha]] called a Tracer as part of a fighting squadron attached to the spacecraft carrier ''Lysithea''. When the ''Lysithea'' leaves Earth to search for the Tarsians, Mikako's friend Noboru Terao ([[Makoto Shinkai]] (original Japanese),<ref name=\"Details\" /> [[Chihiro Suzuki]] (Japanese),<ref name=\"ADV Char\">{{cite web |title=''Voices of a Distant Star'' Characters |url=http://www.advfilms.com/favorites/voices/characters/characters.shtml |publisher=[[A.D.

The two continue to communicate across space using the e-mail facilities on their mobile telephones. As the ''Lysithea'' travels deeper into space, messages take increasingly longer to reach Noboru on Earth, and the time-lag of their correspondence eventually spans years.\n\nThe narrative begins in 2047. Mikako is apparently alone in a hauntingly empty city, trying to contact people through her mobile telephone. She wakes up in her Tracer orbiting an extrasolar planet.  She then goes to Agartha, the fictional fourth planet of the [[Sirius|Sirius Solar System]]. Mikako sends an e-mail to Noboru (which shows the date 2047-09-16), with the subject \"I am here\", which would reach him eight years later. Some flashes of imagery, perhaps indicative of memory, a hallucination, or even a mystical encounter, are then shown. The room shown at the beginning of the animation is presented again; Mikako is squatting in the corner, sobbing and pleading with her [[doppelganger]] to let her see Noboru again so she can tell him she loves him.\n\nThe ship's alarm warns Mikako that the Tarsians are surrounding her, but she does not understand.  A climactic battle ensues. On Earth, Noboru receives the message almost nine years later. At Agartha, three of the four carriers equipped with the warp engines which brought the expeditionary force to Sirius have been destroyed. The ''Lysithea'' is still intact after Mikako joins the fight and stops its destruction. After winning the battle, Mikako lets her damaged Tracer drift in space.\n\nIn the manga, 16-year-old Mikako sends a message to 25-year-old Noboru, telling him that she loves him. By this time, Noboru himself has joined the UN, which has launched a rescue mission for the Lysithea. When Mikako hears that the UN is sending help for their rescue, she consults a list of people on the mission, and finds that Noboru is among them. The manga ends with Mikako saying that they will definitely meet again.\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Voices Screenshots.JPG|thumb|Screenshots of places in Japan used in the animation of ''Voices of a Distant Star'']]\n\n''Voices of a Distant Star'' was written, directed and produced by Makoto Shinkai on his [[Power Mac G4]] using [[LightWave 3D|LightWave]], [[Adobe Photoshop|Adobe Photoshop 5.0]], [[Adobe After Effects|Adobe After Effects 4.1]] and [[Commotion (animation)|Commotion 3.1 DV]] software.<ref name= \"Details\">{{cite web|title=''Hoshi no Koe'' details|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2002-08-06/hoshi-no-koe-details|date=August 6, 2002|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|access-date=November 12, 2010|archive-date=November 24, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201124121316/https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2002-08-06/hoshi-no-koe-details|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|script-title=ja:\u30d3\u30b8\u30e5\u30a2\u30eb\u8868\u73fe|url=http://www2.odn.ne.jp/~ccs50140/stars/visual.html|publisher=[[Makoto Shinkai]]/[[CoMix Wave Films|CoMix Wave Inc.]]|access-date=December 16, 2013|language=ja|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120902003934/http://www2.odn.ne.jp/~ccs50140/stars/visual.html|archive-date=September 2, 2012|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Around June 2000, Shinkai drew the first picture for ''Voices''{{mdash}}of a girl holding a mobile telephone in a cockpit.<ref>{{cite video|date=February 2, 2002|title=Makoto Shinkai Interview|medium=DVD|language=ja|publisher=CoMix Wave Inc.|location=Japan|time=02:38\u201302:45|quote='''Makoto Shinkai''': Around June 2000, I drew one image illustration.
