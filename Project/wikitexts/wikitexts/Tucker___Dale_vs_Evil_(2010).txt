It stars [[Tyler Labine]], [[Alan Tudyk]], [[Katrina Bowden]], [[Brandon Jay McLaren]], [[Jesse Moss (actor)|Jesse Moss]], and [[Chelan Simmons]]. Labine and Tudyk play a pair of well-meaning hillbillies who are mistaken for killers by a group of clueless college students. The film premiered at the 2010 [[Sundance Film Festival]] and received a [[limited release]] in the United States.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per [[WP:FILMPLOT]], film plots should be between 400 and 700 words. -->\n\nAllison, Chad, Chloe, Chuck, Jason, Naomi, Todd, Mitch, and Mike are college kids going camping in [[West Virginia]]. While at a gas station, they encounter Tucker and Dale, two well-meaning [[Hillbilly|hillbillies]] who have just bought the vacation home of their dreams: a run-down lakefront cabin, deep in the woods. On Tucker's advice, Dale tries to talk to Allison, but because of his [[inferiority complex]] and appearance, he only scares her and her friends. On the way to the cabin that Tucker has recently bought, they are pulled over by Sheriff Gurr, who warns them of the dangers of the area.\n\nTucker and Dale arrive at their decrepit cabin and begin repairing it. Nearby in the woods, Chad tells a story about the \"Memorial Day Massacre\", a hillbilly attack which took place 20 years ago. The college kids go skinny-dipping where Tucker and Dale are fishing, and Allison, startled, hits her head. Tucker and Dale save her from drowning, but her friends think she has been kidnapped. When Allison wakes up in Tucker and Dale's cabin the next day, she is initially scared but gradually befriends them. The other college kids arrive at the cabin to save Allison from her \"psychopathic captors\", and Chuck runs away to get the police. While Dale and Allison are inside the cabin, Tucker angers some bees while clearing dead wood and frantically waves around his chainsaw as he flees, which the college kids misinterpret as hostility. They scatter through the woods, where Mitch accidentally impales himself on a broken tree, killing himself. After finding Mitch's body, Chad persuades the others that they are in a battle for survival.\n\nAllison's friends follow Tucker and Dale back to their cabin and see Allison helping out with construction of an outhouse, but they assume she is being made to dig her own grave. The college kids attack, but Todd accidentally impales himself on his own spear when attacking Dale, and Mike falls into Tucker's wood chipper while trying to tackle him. Allison is accidentally knocked unconscious by Dale's shovel during the attack, and he takes her inside. The other kids assume the hillbillies killed the two when they see Tucker trying to save Mike from the wood chipper. Tucker and Dale think the college kids are a part of a [[suicide pact]], and that contacting the police will make them murder suspects. Chuck arrives back with Sheriff Gurr, who expresses doubt over Tucker and Dale's suicide-pact theory. Gurr goes inside the cabin and accidentally kills himself with a loose beam, then Chuck accidentally kills himself with the sheriff's gun while threatening the hillbillies. Chad reappears and attempts to shoot Tucker and Dale, but only manages to capture Tucker, whom he ties upside down to a tree. Chad then tortures Tucker and cuts off two of his fingers, sending them with a message to Dale, in an attempt to draw him out.\n\nDale leaves to rescue Tucker while Chad and Naomi return to the cabin to save Allison. When Allison tries to explain the situation, they accuse her of having [[Stockholm syndrome]]. Tucker and Dale return, and Allison attempts to lead a calm discussion. Chad says his grandmother told him that his father was killed in the Memorial Day Massacre, and his mother was the lone survivor. Jason and Chloe break in to retrieve Allison, and a fire breaks out. Tucker, Dale, and Allison escape; Naomi, Chloe, and Jason die, and Chad, who is now insane and scarred, vows revenge. After crashing their truck, an injured Tucker tells Dale that Chad has taken Allison to an old [[sawmill]]. At the sawmill, Chad ties Allison to a log and sets it to convey into the saw. Dale arrives and rescues Allison, and the two barricade themselves inside an upstairs office where they discover news clippings revealing Chad's father to be one of the hillbillies responsible for the massacre 20 years ago, and not one of the victims. Chad becomes enraged, but Dale stops his attack by throwing a box of chamomile tea at Chad, giving him an asthma attack. Chad convulses and falls out of a window to his apparent death.\n\nThe police and a news crew arrive late at the cabin and broadcast a news report stating that the deaths appear to be the result of a suicide pact and a deranged killer, who is revealed to be Chad, has survived the fall. The reporter and cameraman are the same two from the movie's opening scene. Tucker watches the report on the news while convalescing in the hospital. Dale enters and they discuss Tucker's recovery. Tucker asks Dale whether he managed to invite Allison on a date and is happy to hear the two of them are going bowling. Later that night at the bowling alley, Dale encourages a fellow hillbilly to talk to some girls and to \"just be himself\".  As Dale and Allison confess their feelings for each other and kiss, the other hillbilly accidentally knocks out a girl in the background, starting a new misunderstanding.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Tyler Labine]] as Dale Dobson, a timid, unsure, but good-natured hillbilly who falls in love with Allison.\n* [[Alan Tudyk]] as Tucker McGee, Dale's friend and property owner of the run-down cabin. Tucker is also very well-meaning and tries to help Dale achieve what he is after. In his case, a woman, particularly Allison.\n* [[Katrina Bowden]] as Allison, a beautiful, level-headed psychology student. She initially is terrified of Dale based on first impression but soon falls in love with him for his gentle and sweet nature. \n* [[Jesse Moss (actor)|Jesse Moss]] as Chad, the group 'leader' and the film's main antagonist. A mentally deranged college student with a ton of psychotic tendencies and a specific prejudice towards hillbillies. \n* [[Chelan Simmons]] as Chloe\n* Philip Granger as Sheriff Gurr\n* [[Brandon Jay McLaren]] as Jason\n* [[Christie Laing]] as Naomi\n* Travis Nelson as Chuck\n* Alex Arsenault as Todd\n* Adam Beauchesne as Mitch\n* Joseph Allan Sutherland as Mike\n* Karen Reigh as Cheryl\n* Tye Evans as Chad's Dad\n* Weezer as Jangers the Dog\n\nThe film's director, Eli Craig, and his wife Sasha have brief roles at the beginning and the end of the movie as a cameraman and reporter respectively.\n\n==Production==\nThe production began in June 2009 with the casting of the actors.
