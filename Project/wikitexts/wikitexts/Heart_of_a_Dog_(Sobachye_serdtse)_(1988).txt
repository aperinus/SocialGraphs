The film consisted of two episodes. The novel written in 1925 was censored in the Soviet Union, but at times of [[perestroika]] shown on the Soviet television.\n\n==Plot==\nThe film is set in [[Moscow]] not long after the [[October Revolution]] where a complaining [[Free-ranging dog|stray dog]] looks for food and shelter. A well-off, well-known [[surgeon]] Philipp Philippovich Preobrazhensky happens to need a dog and with a piece of sausage lures the animal to his big house with annexed practice. The dog is named Sharik and well taken care of by the doctor's maids, but still wonders why he is there. He finds out too late he is needed as a [[animal testing|test animal]]: the doctor implants a [[pituitary gland]] and [[Testicle|testicles]] of a recently deceased [[Alcoholism|alcoholic]] and petty criminal Klim Chugunkin into Sharik.\n\nSharik proceeds to become more and more human during the next days. After his transition to human is complete, it turns out that he inherited all the negative traits of the donor \u2013 bad manners, aggressiveness, use of profanity, heavy drinking \u2013 but still hates cats. He picks for himself the absurd name Poligraf Poligrafovich Sharikov, starts working at the \"Moscow Cleansing Sub-Department responsible for eliminating vagrant [[quadruped]]s (cats, etc.)\" and associating with revolutionaries, who plot to drive Preobrazhensky out of his big apartment. Eventually he turns the life in the professor's house into a nightmare by stealing money, breaking his furniture, flooding the apartment during a cat chase and blackmailing into marriage a girl he met at the cinema.\n\nPreobrazhensky and his friend and assistant, Dr. Bormental, see all their efforts to reform Sharikov fail.\n\nAfter a series of increasingly implacable conflicts, Preobrazhensky learns that Sharikov had attempted to denounce him to the Soviet secret police. He then demands that Sharikov immediately leaves the apartment for good. Sharikov angrily refuses and draws a revolver. An infuriated Bormental attacks Sharikov and, after a short but violent fight, subdues him. The professor then chooses to reverse the procedure.\n\nSharikov turns back into a dog. As Sharik, he does remember little about what has happened to him, but isn't much concerned about that. To his content he is left to live in the professor's apartment.\n\n==Cast==\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-break}}\n*[[Yevgeny Yevstigneyev]] as ''Professor Philipp Philippovich Preobrazhensky''\n*[[Boris Plotnikov]] as ''Dr. Ivan Arnoldovich Bormental, the professor's assistant''\n*[[Vladimir Tolokonnikov]] as ''Polygraph Polygraphovich Sharikov''\n*[[Nina Ruslanova]] as ''Darya Petrovna Ivanova, a cook in the professor's apartment''\n*[[Roman Kartsev]] as ''Schwonder, a chairman of the building committee''\n*[[Olga Melikhova]] as ''Zinaida Prokofievna Bunina, a housemaid and the professor's helper during surgeries''\n** ([[voice-over]] for Melikhova performed by Svetlana Smirnova)\n{{col-break}}\n*Carray as ''Sharik, a stray dog''\n*[[Anzhelika Nevolina]] as ''Vasnetsova, a typist out of the office''\n*[[Vladimir Fyodorov (actor)|Vladimir Fyodorov]] as ''being (Sharik at transitional stage)''\n{{col-end}}\n\n==Details==\n* This screen version of M. Bulgakov's novel is famous for its attention to the original text: practically nothing was deleted for adaptation. However, there are some differences between the novel and the film (in the novel Bormental didn't meet the typist in the cinema and Pyotr Alexandrovich \u2013 an important official cured by Preobrazhensky \u2013 didn't look like [[Joseph Stalin]] as it was shown in the film). The episode in which Bormental presents Sharikov who plays balalaika didn't exist in the novel. However, the phrases of Bormental were taken from the diary of Bormental which was in the original novel. \n* Some scenes (spiritualism, circus) were taken from early Bulgakov's short stories, not from the novel.\n* One of the scientists who witness the transformation of Sharik into a human is called Professor Persikov. He is the protagonist of another of Bulgakov's science-fiction novel, ''[[The Fatal Eggs]]''.\n\n==Awards and honors==\n*[[Prix Italia]] (1989)<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20160807113403/http://www.prixitalia.rai.it/dl/docs/Prix_Italia_Winners_1949-1998.pdf Winners 1949\u20131998]. prixitalia.rai.it</ref>\n*[[Vasilyev Brothers State Prize of the RSFSR]] (1990)<ref>[https://tass.ru/encyclopedia/person/bortko-vladimir-vladimirovich \u0411\u043e\u0440\u0442\u043a\u043e, \u0412\u043b\u0430\u0434\u0438\u043c\u0438\u0440 \u0412\u043b\u0430\u0434\u0438\u043c\u0438\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447]. tass.ru</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* ''[[Dog's Heart]]'', a 1976 joint Italian-German comedy film directed by [[Alberto Lattuada]] based on a novel ''[[Heart of a Dog]]'' by [[Mikhail Bulgakov]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{allmovie|171936|Heart of a Dog}}\n*{{IMDb title|0096126|Heart of a Dog}}\n*{{rotten-tomatoes|m/sobachye-serdtse-heart-of-a-dog}}\n*[http://www.tvc.ru/channel/brand/id/76/show/episodes/episode_id/28814 Secrets of our cinema. \"Heart of a Dog\"]. www.tvc.ru (video)\n\n{{Vladimir Bortko}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Heart Of A Dog (Film)}}\n[[Category:1988 films]]\n[[Category:1988 in the Soviet Union]]\n[[Category:Soviet science fiction films]]\n[[Category:Soviet television films]]\n[[Category:1980s Russian-language films]]\n[[Category:Lenfilm films]]\n[[Category:Soviet black-and-white films]]\n[[Category:Experimental medical treatments in fiction]]\n[[Category:Films based on works by Mikhail Bulgakov]]\n[[Category:Films set in the 1920s]]\n[[Category:Films set in Moscow]]\n[[Category:Films set in the Soviet Union]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Saint Petersburg]]\n[[Category:Films based on Russian novels]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Vladimir Bortko]]\n[[Category:Films about size change]]\n[[Category:1988 science fiction films]]\n[[Category:Television shows directed by Vladimir Bortko]]"}]}}}}
