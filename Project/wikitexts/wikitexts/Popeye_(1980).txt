It is based on [[E. C. Segar]]'s [[Popeye|comics character of the same name]].

He rents a room at the Oyl family's boarding house where the Oyls plan to have their daughter [[Olive Oyl|Olive]] become engaged to Captain [[Bluto]], a powerful, perpetually angry bully who manages the town in the name of the mysterious Commodore. However, on the night of the engagement party, Olive sneaks out after discovering that the only attribute she can report for her bullying fianc\u00e9 is size. She encounters Popeye, who failed to fit in with the townsfolk at the party. The two eventually come across an abandoned baby in a basket. Popeye and Olive adopt the child, naming him [[Swee'Pea]] after the town Sweethaven, and the two return to the Oyls' home. Bluto, whom Olive had stood up, finds out about this encounter and, out of rage, beats up Popeye and imposes heavy taxes on the Oyls' property and possessions. A greedy taxman follows up on Bluto's demand, but Popeye helps the Oyls' financial situation, winning a hefty prize by defeating a boxer named Oxblood Oxheart.\n\nThe next day, Popeye discovers that Swee'Pea can predict the future by whistling when he hears the correct answer to a question. [[J. Wellington Wimpy]], the constantly hungry local mooch and a petty gambler, also notices this and asks Popeye and Olive to take Swee'Pea for a walk. He actually takes him to the \"horse races\" (a mechanical carnival horse game) and wins two games. Hearing of this, Olive and her family decide to get in on the action and use Swee'Pea to win, but an outraged Popeye takes Swee'Pea away.\n\nLater, after Popeye throws the taxman into the sea (thereby earning the town's respect), Wimpy kidnaps the child at Bluto's orders. Later that evening, when Olive checks in on Popeye privately, she overhears him lamenting that Swee'Pea deserves to have two parents and he regrets leaving the way he did. The next morning, Wimpy informs Popeye about the kidnapping after being threatened by Olive. Popeye goes to the Commodore's ship, where he learns that the Commodore, who has been recently tied up by Bluto, is indeed Popeye's father, [[Poopdeck Pappy]], who accepts that Popeye is his son after exposing Popeye's hatred of [[spinach]]. Meanwhile, Bluto kidnaps Olive and sets sail with her and Swee'Pea to find the buried treasure promised by Pappy. Popeye, Pappy, Wimpy, and the Oyl family board Pappy's ship to chase Bluto to a desolate island in the middle of the ocean, called [[Filfla|Scab Island]].\n\nPopeye catches up to Bluto and fights him but, despite his determination, Popeye is overpowered. During the fight, Pappy recovers his treasure and opens the chest to reveal a collection of personal sentimental items from Popeye's infancy, including a few cans of spinach. Salty Sam, a [[gigantic octopus]], awakens and attacks Olive from underwater (after Pappy saves Swee'Pea from a similar fate). With Popeye in a choke hold, Pappy throws him a can of spinach; recognizing Popeye's dislike for spinach, Bluto force-feeds him the can before throwing him into the water. The spinach revitalizes Popeye and boosts his strength, helping him to defeat both Bluto and Salty Sam. Popeye celebrates his victory and his newfound appreciation of spinach while Bluto swims off, having literally turned yellow.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Robin Williams]] as [[Popeye]]\n** [[Jack Mercer]] as the voice of Popeye in the opening\n* [[Shelley Duvall]] as [[Olive Oyl]]\n* [[Paul L.

When [[Robert Evans]] learned that Paramount had lost the bidding for ''Annie'', he held an executive meeting with [[Charles Bluhdorn]], head of Paramount\u2019s parent company [[Gulf+Western]], and executives [[Barry Diller]], [[Michael Eisner]] and [[Jeffrey Katzenberg]] in which he asked about comic strip characters which the studio held the rights to which could also be used in order to create a movie musical, and one attendee said \"Popeye\".{{Sfn|Parish|2006}}\n\nAt that time, even though [[King Features Syndicate]] (now a unit of [[Hearst Communications]]) retained the television rights to Popeye and related characters, with [[Hanna-Barbera]] then producing the series ''[[The All-New Popeye Hour]]'' under license from King Features, Paramount had long held the theatrical rights to the Popeye character, due to the studio's having released Popeye [[Animation|cartoon shorts]] produced by [[Fleischer Studios]] and [[Famous Studios]] from 1933 to 1957.\n\nEvans commissioned [[Jules Feiffer]] to write a script. In 1977, he said he wanted [[Dustin Hoffman]] to play Popeye opposite [[Lily Tomlin]] as Olive Oyl, with [[John Schlesinger]] directing.<ref>{{Cite news |date=October 14, 1977 |last=Flatley |first=Guy |title=At the Movies: Producer Sets Hoffman's Sail For 'Popeye' |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |page=58 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1977/10/14/archives/new-jersey-weekly-at-the-movies-producer-sets-hoffmans-sail-for.html }}</ref> Hoffman later dropped out due to creative differences with Feiffer.

Disney acquired the foreign rights through its [[Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures|Buena Vista]] unit; the deal was motivated by the drawing power that the studio's films had in Europe.\n\n[[Principal photography]] commenced on January 23, 1980.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://popeyemalta.com/about-us.html |title=Explore \u2013 Popeye Village Malta |website=popeyemalta.com }}</ref><ref name=\"Niemi\">{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wG3lCwAAQBAJ&q=popeye+filming+january+wrapped+june+19&pg=PT181 |title=The Cinema of Robert Altman: Hollywood Maverick |last=Niemi |first=Robert |date=2016 |publisher=Niemi |isbn=9780786486946 }}</ref> The film was shot in [[Malta]]. The elaborate Sweethaven set was constructed beyond what was needed for filming, adding to the cost and complexity of the production, along with a recording studio, editing facilities, and other buildings, including living quarters. Filming [[Wrap (filmmaking)|wrapped]] on June 19, 1980, three weeks over schedule due to bad weather.<ref name=\"Niemi\"/> The set still exists, and it is a popular tourist attraction known as [[Popeye Village]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/popeye-village |title=Popeye Village \u2013 Mellieha, Malta|website=[[Atlas Obscura]]|access-date=24 February 2021}}</ref> Parish wrote that Robin Williams referred to this set as \"[[Stalag]] Altman\".{{Sfn|Parish|2006}}\n\nParish notes other production problems. Evans insisted the screenplay reflect the comic-strip Popeye and not the \"distorted\" cartoon version. Feiffer's script went through several rewrites, and he expressed concern that too much screen time was being devoted to minor characters. Feiffer also disliked Nilsson's songs, feeling they weren't right for the film. Popeye's original muscle arms formed of silicon rubber were difficult for Williams to manipulate and remove after filming, so two Italian artisans were brought to Malta to remake them and Altman had to juggle his shooting schedule. He also had the cast sing some of their musical numbers during filming, breaking with the traditional movie-musical practice of actors recording the songs in a studio first and then lip-synching\u2014thus reducing the sound quality due to difficulties in accurately capturing the voices. Williams also had to re-record his dialogue after running into trouble with his character's mumbling style, a by-product of talking with a pipe in his mouth, and his penchant for ad-libs led to clashes with the director. The final battle involving the octopus ran into trouble when the mechanical beast failed to work properly. After the production cost rose beyond $20 million, Paramount ordered Altman to wrap filming and return to California with what he had.{{Sfn|Parish|2006}}\n\n== Release ==\n{{Expand section|date=May 2010}}\n''Popeye'' [[Film premiere|premiered]] at the [[TCL Chinese Theatre|Mann's Chinese Theater]] in Los Angeles on December 6, 1980, two days before what would have been E.C.

He wrote all the original songs and co-produced the music with producer [[Bruce Robb]] at [[Cherokee Studios]]. The soundtrack in the film was unusual in that the actors sang some of the songs \"live\". For that reason, the studio album did not quite match the tracks heard in the film. [[Van Dyke Parks]] is credited as music arranger.\n\nThe U.S. [[Trailer (promotion)|trailer for the film]] contained the song \"I Yam What I Yam\" from the soundtrack album, not the film's live performance.\n\n\"I'm Popeye the Sailor Man\" was composed by [[Sammy Lerner]] for [[Popeye the Sailor (1933 cartoon)|the original Max Fleischer cartoon]].\n\n{{Track listing\n| title1          = I Yam What I Yam\n| length1         = 2:16\n| title2          = He Needs Me\n| length2         = 3:33\n| title3          = Swee' Pea's Lullaby\n| length3         = 2:06\n| title4          = Din' We\n| length4         = 3:06\n| title5          = Sweethaven\u2014An Anthem\n| length5         = 2:56\n| title6          = Blow Me Down\n| length6         = 4:07\n| title7          = Sailin{{'-}}\n| length7         = 2:48\n| title8          = It's Not Easy Being Me\n| length8         = 2:20\n| title9          = He's Large\n| length9         = 4:19\n| title10         = I'm Mean\n| length10        = 2:33\n| title11         = Kids\n| length11        = 4:23\n| title12         = I'm Popeye the Sailor Man\n| length12        = 1:19\n}}\nThe song \"Everything Is Food\" was not included on the album, while the song \"Din' We\" (which was cut from the film) was included.
