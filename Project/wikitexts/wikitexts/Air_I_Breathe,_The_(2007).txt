The film stars [[Kevin Bacon]], [[Julie Delpy]], [[Brendan Fraser]], [[Andy Garcia]], [[Sarah Michelle Gellar]], [[Emile Hirsch]], and [[Forest Whitaker]].\n\nThe concept of the film is based on an ancient [[China|Chinese]] proverb that breaks life down into four emotional cornerstones \u2013 [[Happiness]] (Whitaker), [[Pleasure]] (Fraser), [[Sorrow (emotion)|Sorrow]] (Gellar), and [[Love]] (Bacon). The proverb speaks of these emotions, not as isolated fragments of feelings, but as elements that make up the whole of the human existence. Each of the four protagonists is based on one of the four emotions; and like the proverb their paths are inextricably linked to each other, akin to the [[Finger]]s (Garcia) of a hand. None of the four main characters' actual names are mentioned in the whole film, although Gellar's character's stage name, \"Trista\", is mentioned several times.\n\n''The Air I Breathe'' was financed by NALA Investments through its production company [[NALA Films]], and was released on January 25, 2008 in the United States. The film received mainly negative reviews from critics, but has since become a [[cult film]], and some of the cast's performances were praised with Gellar, Garcia, and Whitaker's performances being singled out.\n\n==Plot==\nEach of the elements of life is portrayed using four different people on the urban streets of [[Los Angeles]], with Fingers (Garcia), a gangster, playing the part that intertwines all four individuals.\n\n;'''Happiness'''\n\n[[Forest Whitaker]] plays a meek bank employee who loves [[butterflies]]. He accidentally overhears acquaintances discuss a fixed horse race, and decides to bet $50,000, borrowing from a bookie. Unfortunately he loses the bet.\n\nThe bookie, Fingers, derives his name from his habit of cutting off the fingers of those who don\u2019t pay back their debts. Fingers threatens the bank employee while Fingers' mob enforcer visits him to collect. The mob enforcer pities the bank employee, who gives him a [[revolver]] and leaves. In desperation, the bank employee robs his own bank. While fleeing, he is slightly hit by a moving vehicle, then escapes to the top of a building. Surrounded, the police order the bank employee to drop his gun. He does not comply, throwing the money bag off the roof, and is killed by the police. When he hits the ground, his coat is spread out making him look like a butterfly.\n \n;'''Pleasure'''\n\n[[Brendan Fraser]] plays the mob enforcer who has a tragic past and an ability to see the future of the people he meets, an ability that deprives him of the pleasure of enjoying the surprises in life. When he was young, the mob enforcer was forced to defend his younger brother in a street fight against two teenagers. The mob enforcer won the fight but found his brother lying dead. The mob enforcer often has flashbacks of this scene throughout the film. Later in life, the mob enforcer joins Fingers' gang and becomes one of his favorites due mostly to his ability. He, however, cannot see the future of Trista, a somewhat morose up-and-coming pop singer/dancer.\n\nThe mob enforcer is assigned to look after Fingers' visiting nephew Tony. He has a vision of Tony climbing a fence and falling back. To avoid trouble, he leaves Tony in a club while working (collecting protection money). Unfortunately, one of the girls that Tony is with, high on drugs, staggers into the next room. When Tony follows her, they struggle over a gun, and an older mobster gets shot. The mob enforcer rescues Tony, and they run from the henchmen, ending at the fence of the earlier vision. Tony gets away, and it is the mob enforcer who is caught by the henchmen, severely beaten, and then treated by Dr. Love (Bacon) at a hospital.\n\n;'''Sorrow'''\n\n[[Sarah Michelle Gellar]] plays the pop singer/dancer whose stage name is Trista. In flashback, it's revealed that as a young child, she saw her father killed when he was accidentally hit by a moving car, immediately after promising to 'be there for her', and the loss affects her deeply. Trista's manager is deeply indebted to Fingers, and embezzles Trista's money to pay Fingers, but that is not enough, so he assigns Trista's contract to Fingers. Trista, incensed, escapes from Fingers and meets Pleasure. Fingers, naturally, has already ordered his team to find her. Pleasure, sympathetic to her, helps Trista by letting her stay with him, knowing that his house is the only place Fingers wouldn't search for her. They become lovers, but soon Fingers finds out about her location, and kills Pleasure, causing Trista even more sorrow. Her [[blood group|blood type]] is [[Kell antigen system|Kp(a-b-)]], which she reveals when a TV interviewer ([[Jon Bernthal]]) asks her what is special about her. This becomes hopeful information when Love hears it on the television, as he is searching for that blood type, the same as Gina's, when he is trying to save her life.\n\n;'''Love'''\n\n[[Kevin Bacon]] plays Dr. Love, who is in a relationship with his longtime friend Gina ([[Julie Delpy]]). He never confessed his love and, so, she married his best friend. Gina gets bitten by a poisonous snake and needs a rare type of blood. Desperate, Dr. Love races to the location where Trista is filming the interview; however, Trista's assistant is in the process of trying to help Trista run away. Dr. Love runs to Trista. Her bodyguards, thinking he is a crazed fan, grab him while Trista is accidentally knocked down, hits her head and ends up in the hospital. When she awakens, Fingers informs her that she will have to [[abortion|abort]] the baby that she has just become aware that she is carrying. In her sorrow that the baby, the one thing she has left of the man she loved will be lost, she sneaks out of her room and goes to the roof to jump off and commit [[suicide]]. Dr. Love, by circumstance, sees her and races up in time to see her step off the ledge. Dr. Love grabs the bed sheet that she had wrapped around her like a cape and catches her. He tells her she will have to come up and grab his hand for him to be able to pull her up. After she does this, the movie flashes to Gina, saved, awakening from her [[coma]]. Dr. Love loans Trista his car as a gift for saving Gina and she leaves the hospital.\n\n;'''Ending'''\n\nFingers looks for Trista at the hospital, but his efforts to find her are in vain, as she has already left. As Trista escapes in Love's car, she slightly hits Happiness as he runs in front of her car in his dash from the bank (in the scene that we saw from his point of view earlier); as she sits at the intersection, as she's coming to grips with all that has happened, the money bag Happiness threw from the top of the building lands on her car's rooftop. The film closes with Trista at an airport traveling away, the money bag providing her with all the financial support she needs to escape from Fingers and start a new life for herself and her baby abroad.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Sarah Michelle Gellar]] as Trista / [[Sorrow (emotion)|Sorrow]]\n** [[Sasha Pieterse]] as young Sorrow\n* [[Julie Delpy]] as Gina\n* [[Brendan Fraser]] as [[Pleasure]]\n** [[Jason Dolley]] as young Pleasure\n* [[Andy Garcia]] as [[Fingers]]\n* [[Kevin Bacon]] as Dr. [[Love]]\n* [[Clark Gregg]] as Henry\n* [[Emile Hirsch]] as Tony\n* [[Forest Whitaker]] as [[Happiness]]\n* Will Maier as Mr. Park\n* [[Evan Parke]] as Danny\n* [[Cecilia Su\u00e1rez]] as Alison\n* [[John Cho]] as Bart\n* [[Kelly Hu]] as Jiyoung\n* [[Todd Stashwick]] as Frank\n* [[Kari W\u00fchrer]] as Correspondent\n* [[Jon Bernthal]] as Interviewer\n* [[Taylor Nichols]] as Trista's Father\n}}\n\n==Critical response==\nReviews for the film were overwhelmingly negative.
