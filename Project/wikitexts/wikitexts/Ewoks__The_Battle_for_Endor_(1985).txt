A sequel to ''[[Caravan of Courage: An Ewok Adventure]]'', it focuses on Cindel Towani, the human girl from the first film, who, after being orphaned, joins the [[Ewoks]] in protecting their village and defeating the marauders who have taken control of the [[Endor (Star Wars)|Endor moon]].\n\n== Plot ==\nNearly six months have passed since the events of the first film;<ref name=Yahoo!>{{cite web|last=Alter|first=Ethan |title=''Star Wars'': How the Ewoks Came to TV 31 Years Ago |url=https://www.yahoo.com/tv/star-wars-ewoks-caravan-of-courage-the-battle-190346641.html |publisher=[[Yahoo!]]|date=December 15, 2015|access-date=March 1, 2017}}</ref> the Towani family's star cruiser is almost completely fixed and Jeremitt is putting the final touches on the craft. While the family is preparing to leave the [[forest moon of Endor]], the Ewok village is attacked by a [[Sanyassan|Marauder]] group led by Terak and his witch-like sorceress Charal. Many Ewoks are captured, while Jeremitt, Catarine, and Mace are killed helping to defend the Ewok village.  The marauders steal a power cell from the Towani's star cruiser believing it to have some sort of magic power over the stars.\n\nWhile running away from the marauders, Cindel and Wicket meet Teek, a small, fast native of Endor. Teek takes them to the home of Noa Briqualon, a human male who is angered by their uninvited presence and throws them out. Eventually he proves himself to be kindhearted, letting Teek steal food for Cindel and Wicket, and inviting the two in when they attempt to build a fire for warmth outside.\n\nAt the Marauders' castle, Terak orders Charal to find Cindel, assuming she knows how to use \"the power\" in the energy cell stolen from Jeremitt's star cruiser. Meanwhile, Noa, Cindel, Wicket, and Teek are becoming friends. It is revealed that Noa is rebuilding his own wrecked star cruiser, only missing the energy cell, originally landing with a friend of his named Salak who disappeared while searching for another cell. Cindel is awakened one morning by a song her mother used to sing. She follows the voice to find a woman singing, who transforms into Charal and takes her to Terak. He orders Cindel to activate \"the power\", but she cannot, and is imprisoned with the Ewoks where it is revealed Salak was killed after telling Terak about \"the power\". Outside, Noa, Wicket, and Teek sneak into the castle, free Cindel and the Ewoks, and escape with the energy cell.\n\nTerak, Charal, and the Marauders pursue them back to the ship, where Wicket leads the Ewoks in defense of the cruiser as Noa installs the energy cell. The Ewoks put up a valiant effort, and are nearly beaten by the time Noa powers up the ship and uses its laser cannons to fend off the Marauders. Cindel goes to save Wicket and is captured by Terak, as the other Marauders retreat. Terak and Noa face off, with Wicket finally coming to the rescue, killing Terak and simultaneously leaving Charal trapped in bird form. Shortly thereafter, goodbyes are said, and Cindel leaves Endor with Noa on his starship.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Warwick Davis]] as [[Wicket W.

Co-director Ken Wheat explained the production and inspiration of the film:\n\n{{blockquote|Lucas guided the creation of the story over the course of two four-hour sessions we had with him. He'd just watched ''[[Heidi]]'' with his daughter the weekend before these took place, and the story idea he pushed was having the little girl from the first Ewok TV movie become an orphan who ends up living with a grumpy old hermit in the woods.\n\nWe'd been thinking about the adventure films we'd liked as kids, like ''[[Swiss Family Robinson (1960 film)|Swiss Family Robinson]]'' and ''[[The 7th Voyage of Sinbad|The Seventh Voyage of Sinbad]]'', so we suggested having space marauders, which was fine with George \u2014 as long as they were 7 feet tall, of course! The rest of the brainstorming was done along those lines. Joe Johnston (the production designer and second unit director) and Phil Tippett (the creature supervisor) were involved in the second day's story session, and they contributed an assortment of bits and pieces.<ref name=\"rb\">{{cite book|last1=Robb|first1=Brian J.|title=Star Wars : the unauthorised inside story of George Lucas's epic|date=2012|publisher=Robinson|location=London|isbn=978-1780333991|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=i9jABAAAQBAJ&q=EON+Magazine+ken+wheat&pg=PT84}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theforce.net/holonet/story/Battle_for_Endor_Writer_Interview_77423.asp|title=Battle for Endor Writer Interview |website=TheForce.Net|date=February 11, 2000|access-date=September 3, 2018}}</ref>}}\n\nLucas\u2019 involvement during production was primarily in the design and editing stages, according to Wheat. The film's working title was ''Ewoks II''.<ref>{{cite book |last=Robb |first=Brian J. |title=A Brief Guide to Star Wars |date=2012 |publisher=Little, Brown Book Group |isbn=9781780335834 |page=84 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=i9jABAAAQBAJ&pg=PT84}}</ref>\n\n=== Effects ===\nBoth Ewok films were some of the last intensive [[stop motion|stop-motion]] animation work [[Industrial Light & Magic]] produced, as in the early 1980s, the technique was being replaced by [[go motion]] animation, a more advanced form with motorized articulated puppets that moved while the camera shutter was open, capturing motion blur in the otherwise static puppet, eliminating the harsh staccato movement often associated with stop motion. However, the budgets of the Ewok films were such that go motion was simply too expensive for the projects, so stop motion was used to realize creatures such as the condor dragon, the [[blurrg]]s, and the boar-wolves.\n\nThe Ewok movies proved an opportunity for Industrial Light & Magic to hone a new technique in photographing [[matte paintings]], called latent image matte painting. In this technique, during live action photography a section of the camera's lens is blocked off, remaining unexposed, and a painting is crafted to occupy that space. The film would then be rewound, the blocked areas reversed, and the painting photographed. Since the painting now existed on the original film, there would be no generational quality loss.\n\n=== Music ===\n{{Main|Ewoks (soundtrack)}}\nThe [[film score|musical score]] for ''Ewoks: The Battle for Endor'' was composed by [[Peter Bernstein (composer)|Peter Bernstein]]. Selections from the score were released on [[LP (format)|LP]] by [[Var\u00e8se Sarabande]] in 1986.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Osborne|first1=Jerry|title=Movie/TV Soundtracks and Original Cast Recordings Price and Reference Guide|date=2010|publisher=Osborne Enterprises Publishing|location=[[Port Townsend, Washington]]|isbn=978-0932117373|page=175}}</ref> The release was known simply as ''Ewoks'', and also contained cues from Bernstein's previous score to ''The Ewok Adventure''.\n\n== Alternate versions ==\n* In a home video release, the following two scenes were deleted: when being chased by Terak's men, Wicket races for Noa's house but Noa tells him the only chance they have got is the star cruiser. Then a scene that happened shortly after where the men went inside and burned down Noa's house.\n* When Cindel has a nightmare about bad men coming into Noa's house, a scene was cut from the television broadcast, in which Cindel rushes to Noa's bed to wake him up, but instead finds Terak in the bed and wakes up. The television version just shows Cindel waking up after the men break in.\n* Cindel's lines: \"Do something, Wicket! Use your sling! You hit the ring!\" have been altered to \"Do something, Wicket! Do something!\" for the DVD release.\n* In the original TV broadcast of the film, the end credits were rolled over the final scene, but in all home-video releases of the film, the end credits are rolled over a traditional black background ''after'' the final scene.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}\n\n== Adaptations ==\nIn 1986, [[Random House]] published a children's book adaptation of ''The Battle for Endor'' called ''The Ring, the Witch, and the Crystal: An Ewok Adventure''. The book was written by Cathy East Dubowski, and utilized the film's storyline and imagery.\n\n== Release ==\n''Ewoks: The Battle for Endor'' initially premiered as an [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] TV special on November 24, 1985. It was given a limited international theatrical release in 1986.{{Citation needed|date=October 2020}} After the run had disappeared due to low box office receipts, it appeared on home video in late 1987 on MGM/UA and re-issued for retail in 1988 and 1990. The U.S. later released on [[VHS]] and [[Laserdisc]] in 1990 through [[MGM Home Entertainment|MGM/UA Home Video]].\n\nThe film was released on DVD with its predecessor as a double-feature collection entitled ''Star Wars: Ewok Adventures'' on November 23, 2004 via [[20th Century Fox Home Entertainment]]. One film was on each side of a single double-sided disc, with no bonus material.\n\nIn January 2019, Disney and Lucasfilm released ''The Battle for Endor'' on [[Amazon Prime Video]], where it was available to rent or buy in standard definition. As of December 2019, the film was no longer available through that service.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07LFKG96J/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_ep_dp_M8hyCb3CCP0R9_nodl|title = Watch Star Wars Ewok Adventures the Battle for Endor &#124; Prime Video|website = Amazon}}</ref>\n\nPrior to 2021, Disney announced no plans to add the Ewok films to its streaming service, [[Disney+]].

But when it's over it's over, and there is no residue.

They point to magical phenomena in both films, which is a fantasy element. They argue that in a science fiction story, the hero wants to disrupt or challenge the hierarchy of a supposed \"[[utopia]]n\" society; whereas in both Ewok films, society is not challenged or disputed. Additionally, they argue, that while the ''Star Wars'' saga also has fairy tale [[Trope (literature)|tropes]], it adhered more towards science fiction.<ref name=\"BrodeDeyneka2012\">{{cite book|author1=Douglas Brode|author2=Leah Deyneka|title=Myth, Media, and Culture in Star Wars: An Anthology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LV4Wdl13aqMC&pg=PA130|date=14 June 2012|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=978-0-8108-8513-4|pages=130\u2013131}}</ref> Another author agreed that the films are fairy tales, whereas \"Science explains all magic.\"<ref name=\"Charles\">{{cite book|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LV4Wdl13aqMC&q=Myth%2C+Media%2C+and+Culture+in+Star+Wars+ewok+adventures+fairytale&pg=PA130|title=Myth, Media, and Culture in Star Wars: An Anthology|last=Charles|first=Eric|date=2012|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=978-0-810-88513-4|pages=129\u2013131|chapter=The Jedi Network: ''Star Wars''{{'}} Portrayal and Inspirations on the Small Screen|editor-last2=Deyneka|editor-first2=Leah|editor-first1=Douglas|editor-last1=Brode|access-date=May 20, 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn contrast to his negative review of its predecessor, Aidan Mason of ''Pop Culture Beast'' stated the film, \"manages to improve on the original\" and felt much more like a ''Star Wars'' film, although he was still critical of the acting.<ref>{{cite web|title=Star Wars: Every Movie Ranked|url=http://www.popculturebeast.com/star-wars-every-movie-reviewed/|website=Pop Culture Beast|date=4 May 2021}}</ref>\n\n== Legacy ==\n{{See_also|Caravan of Courage: An Ewok Adventure#Legacy}}\nSeveral elements from the film have gone on to appear in other works of the [[Star Wars expanded to other media|''Star Wars'' Expanded Universe]], which was declared non-canon and rebranded as ''Legends'' in 2014.<ref>{{Cite web|date=April 25, 2014|title=The Legendary ''Star Wars Expanded Universe'' Turns a New Page|url=https://www.starwars.com/news/the-legendary-star-wars-expanded-universe-turns-a-new-page|access-date=May 26, 2016|website=StarWars.com}}</ref>\n\n* ''[[Ewoks (TV series)|Ewoks]]'' (1985\u20131987) was an ABC animated series featuring the Ewoks that ran for two seasons; it was retroactively set before the [[Star Wars original trilogy|original ''Star Wars'' trilogy]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Veekhoven|first=Tim|date=September 3, 2015|title=From Wicket to the Duloks: Revisiting the Star Wars: Ewoks Animated Series|url=https://www.starwars.com/news/from-wicket-to-the-duloks-revisiting-the-star-wars-ewoks-animated-series|access-date=November 27, 2018|website=StarWars.com}}</ref>\n* ''[[Tyrant's Test]]'' (1996) - In the ''Star Wars Legends'' continuity, Cindel Towani went on to appear in ''Tyrant's Test'', the third book of [[Michael P.
