The film features an [[ensemble cast]], including [[Al Pacino]], [[Cameron Diaz]], [[Dennis Quaid]], [[Jamie Foxx]], [[James Woods]], [[LL Cool J]], [[Ann-Margret]], [[Lauren Holly]], [[Matthew Modine]], [[John C. McGinley]], [[Charlton Heston]], [[Bill Bellamy]], [[Lela Rochon]], [[Aaron Eckhart]], [[Elizabeth Berkley]], and  NFL players [[Jim Brown]] and [[Lawrence Taylor]]. It is partly based on the 1984 novel ''On Any Given Sunday'' by NFL defensive end [[Pat Toomay]]; the title is derived from a line in the book (also used in the film) that a team can win or lose on \"any given Sunday\", said by the fictitious coach Tony D'Amato.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://m.imdb.com/title/tt0146838/ |title=Any Given Sunday (1999) - IMDb |website=[[IMDb]] |access-date=2021-05-28 |archive-date=2021-05-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210520214001/https://m.imdb.com/title/tt0146838/ |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nCameo roles also featured many former American football players including [[Dick Butkus]], [[Y. A. Tittle]], [[Pat Toomay]], [[Warren Moon]], [[Johnny Unitas]], [[Ricky Watters]], [[Emmitt Smith]] and [[Terrell Owens]], as well as coach [[Barry Switzer]].\n\n==Plot==\n\nThe Miami Sharks, a once-great [[American football]] team, are struggling to make the 2001 Associated Football Franchises of America (AFFA) [[playoffs]]. They are coached by thirty-year veteran Tony D'Amato, who has fallen out of favor with young team owner Christina Pagniacci and [[offensive coordinator]] and D'Amato's expected successor Nick Crozier. In the thirteenth game of the season, both [[starting quarterback]] Jack \"Cap\" Rooney and second-string quarterback Tyler Cherubini are injured and forced to leave the field. The desperate Sharks call upon third-string quarterback Willie Beamen to replace them. While a nervous Beamen makes a number of errors and fails to win the game for the Sharks, he plays well and gains confidence. Rooney vows to make it back by the playoffs, with D'Amato promising to not give up on him.\n\nThe next day, D'Amato and Pagniacci argue about the direction of the team. Pagniacci favors Crozier and wants to eventually cut Rooney. D'Amato argues that Pagniacci's father, the previous owner, would never meddle in his coaching plans. During the next game, to D'Amato's chagrin, Beamen disregards the team's conservative [[offense (sports)|offense]] and changes plays in the huddle. As the media hails Beamen as the next model of quarterback, the newfound success feeds his growing [[narcissism]] and leads to tension with teammates and coaches. During a confrontation with Beamen, D'Amato [[demotion|demotes]] him back to the bench. After Beamen gives an interview taking sole credit for the Sharks' winning streak, the other players refuse to perform for Beamen and consequently lose a home game. After Beamen gets into a brawl with Julian \"J-Man\" Washington, an irate D'Amato expresses his embarrassment at his team before leaving. Beamen contemplates and amends his self-centered behavior.\n\nAs the playoffs come around, Sharks [[middle linebacker]] Luther Lavay reminds Beamen how lucky he is to be in the league and to find a life outside of football; his words fall on deaf ears. D'Amato worsens his relationship with Pagniacci and berates Rooney for second-guessing his availability. Before the game, D'Amato gives a speech urging team unity that Beamen takes to heart and energizes the rest of the team. Rooney returns as starting quarterback, but is injured with a [[concussion]] after scoring a [[touchdown]]. Rooney urges D'Amato to let Beamen finish the game; after an argument, D'Amato relents. Subsequently, Pagniacci enters the locker room to demand that D'Amato play Beamen. After she and D'Amato argue, Beamen informs her that he had already been told he would start the second half. Beamen apologizes to his teammates for his actions and leads the team to win. In a post-game talk with D'Amato, Beamen dedicates the next game to Rooney, but admits that he is worried about his ongoing health.\n\nAn epilogue voiceover says that the Sharks eventually lost the championship final (the Pantheon Cup) to San Francisco. At D'Amato's final press conference as head coach, he is thanked by Pagniacci. D'Amato is expected to announce his retirement, but he instead drops two bombshells and announces that he has been hired as head coach and general manager of an [[expansion team]] in [[New Mexico]], the Albuquerque Aztecs, and that he has signed Willie Beamen to be his starting quarterback and [[franchise player]].\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Al Pacino]] as Tony D'Amato, [[head coach]] of the Miami Sharks. Having held his position for decades and been given much autonomy by the team's owner, \"Tony D\" is respected for great successes, including two Pantheon Cups, the championship for this (fictional) professional football league. He devoted so much time to the team, he became estranged from his wife and children. D'Amato's traditional methods have come under fire from management and the media for recent failures, including missing the playoffs. Bitter that he was never promoted to general manager, D'Amato resents the hands-on \"interference\" of Christina Pagniacci, who succeeded her father Arturo as team owner. His last name comes from boxing trainer [[Constantine \"Cus\" D'Amato]].<ref name=\"filmblather1\">{{cite web |author=Euegene Novikov |url=http://filmblather.com/films/anygivensunday/ |title=Any Given Sunday |date=20 December 1999 |publisher=Film Blather |access-date=2012-01-29 |archive-date=2012-03-31 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120331143934/http://filmblather.com/films/anygivensunday/ |url-status=live }}</ref>\n* [[Cameron Diaz]] as Christina Pagniacci, owner and [[General manager (sports)|general manager]]. She inherited the team from her father and boasts a [[Samuel Curtis Johnson Graduate School of Management#MBA program|Cornell MBA]]. She attributes the team's disappointments to Coach D'Amato's \"old-school methods\" and takes a more hands-on approach, bringing in innovative new [[offensive coordinator]] Nick Crozier as his eventual successor. She hints that D'Amato will not return after his contract expires, adding to his distractions. She also threatens to move the franchise if the city refuses to build a new stadium, causing a confrontation with the AFFA Commissioner and the [[Mayor of Miami]].<ref name=\"filmblather1\"/>\n* [[Dennis Quaid]] as Jack \"Cap\" Rooney, starting [[quarterback]] and team captain. Seen as being like a son to D'Amato, the two have been credited with the team's greatest on-field successes. Rooney is now an aging veteran who faces injuries and conflicts with team personnel. Pagniacci wants to dump him. Relations have soured between Rooney and wife Cindy ([[Lauren Holly]]), who goads him without sympathy for his physical or mental situation, mercilessly browbeating him when he even mentions retiring. He is injured during a game and is replaced, but is determined to make a comeback. Rooney recovers in time for the first round of the playoffs, wherein he plays well until suffering a hard hit while scoring a touchdown before halftime.<ref name=\"filmblather1\"/>\n* [[James Woods]] as Dr. Harvey Mandrake, the unscrupulous team physician. He risks serious injury to players to enable the team to have a better shot at winning, often at the direction of Pagniacci. He is later fired after his unethical methods are discovered by the conscientious team [[internist]].<ref name=\"filmblather1\"/>\n* [[Jamie Foxx]] as Willie \"Steamin\" Beamen, the third-string quarterback. Beamen has a history that eventually led him to distrust his coaches. In particular, while playing for San Diego, Beamen was made into a defensive secondary player for having \"fast feet\" and was eventually injured while making a tackle. Beamen initially believes that [[racism]] played a major role in his history of being denied opportunities he desired, using an alternative of \"placeism\" to describe a lack of African-American quarterbacks and head coaches in pro football. He takes over as starter after injuries to Rooney and the backup quarterback. Though surprisingly successful, Beamen causes tension among staff and teammates. He frequently changes the plays the coach calls, or just calls his own. These acts create major tension with D'Amato. D'Amato respects Beamen's athletic ability and acknowledges his talents warrant him to be a quarterback, but heavily criticizes his lack of leadership skills and intangibles. He is granted his own music video and even asks owner Pagniacci for a date when she enters a postgame locker room full of naked or partly dressed players like himself. Beamen's antics on and off the field eventually get him demoted to the bench by D'Amato, who firmly believes that a quarterback's most important role is to lead the team and help keep them confident, both of which Beamen took a clear disregard for. Beamen later matures and is inspired by \"Cap\" Rooney's gutsy performance in the Sharks' first playoff game.\n* [[LL Cool J]] as Julian \"J-Man\" Washington, starting [[running back]]. He is very good but becomes increasingly angry at Beamen for his cockiness and tendencies to take plays away from him. He is motivated by incentive clauses in his contract, and D'Amato refers to him as a \"merc\" (mercenary) \"who will be gone before next season.\" Washington later redeems himself to the team by running out-of-bounds in order to stop the play clock while his team was attempting an offensive drive with little time left.\n* [[Ann-Margret]] as Margaret Pagniacci, Christina's mother and the widow of the Sharks' original owner Arturo.\n* [[Lauren Holly]] as Cindy Rooney, wife of Cap Rooney. It is heavily implied that she is no more than a [[trophy wife]], caring more for her wealth and social status than for her husband's health and well-being.\n* [[Lawrence Taylor]] as Luther \"Shark\" Lavay, starting [[middle linebacker]] and the captain of the defense, with a cortisone addiction and is nearing the twilight of a very successful career. Held in high esteem by D'Amato for \"revolutionizing\" his position by being highly skilled in both pass rushing and defending against the run. Mandrake has concealed that \"Shark\" is suffering from a previous injury, a broken neck that did not heal properly. If he suffers a serious hit again, he may be killed or permanently disabled. The team's internist informs him and D'Amato of the situation, but \"Shark\" says he will lose over one million dollars if he does not make his incentive stats or retires as Powers suggests. He also has a confrontation with Beamen over the role of offense vs. defense (which culminates with him cutting Beamen's [[Chevrolet Suburban]] in half with a circular saw during a party). While making a hit, Shark gets knocked unconscious. He awakens and is hauled off on a stretcher, satisfied that he made his one million dollars incentive.\n* [[Jim Brown]] as Monte \"Montezuma\" Monroe, [[defensive coordinator]]. He is vocal and brings intensity to the defense and to the team in general. A longtime friend of D'Amato, who personally confides in Montezuma several times. Monroe states at one point he would like to return to high school coaching where the game is \"pure.\"\n* [[Aaron Eckhart]] as Nick Crozier, offensive coordinator. Nick is an offensive guru brought in from Minnesota by Christina Pagniacci. Young and tech-savvy (making use of a laptop computer while calling plays), he is highly critical of Tony's old-fashioned ways, as well as Beamen's changing the plays in the huddle and Julian's playing for contract incentives. Despite the tension, D'Amato recognizes Crozier's talent. He is named D'Amato's successor after the coach departs to lead an expansion franchise in New Mexico.\n* [[Bill Bellamy]] as Jimmy Sanderson, the Wide Receiver who becomes Willie Beamen's first option on offense once he is moved into the starting Quarterback position, adding to the friction already building up between Willie and Julian.\n* [[Matthew Modine]] as Dr. Ollie Powers, the team's internist. He discovers Dr. Mandrake covering for players who are suffering from near-career-ending injuries but are overdosing on painkillers, steroids and hormones to cover the pain. Powers faces his own dilemma in the need to relieve the players' pain vs. prescribing too much medication at the insistence of the addicted players.\n* [[John C. McGinley]] as Jack Rose, an abrasive and prominent sports reporter. On his own cable show, Rose displays an incredible distaste for all things D'Amato. This leads to D'Amato physically assaulting Rose near the end of the regular season, but no charges are pressed after D'Amato makes a public apology. In spite of their rivalry (or even because of it) he confesses that he will miss D'Amato when he retires.\n* [[Lela Rochon]] as Vanessa Struthers, Longtime girlfriend of Willie Beamen who unsuccessfully tries to pressure him into marriage after being humiliated by Cindy Rooney in front of the other Football wives.\n* [[Elizabeth Berkley]] as Mandy Murphy, a high priced escort who provides Tony with a [[girlfriend experience]] (GFE) when he is feeling lonely.\n* [[Clifton Davis]] as Mayor Tyrone Smalls, who is always a few steps ahead of Christina in her efforts to leverage him into using taxpayer money to build a new stadium for the Sharks.\n* [[Charlton Heston]] as AFFA Football Commissioner\n* [[Andrew Bryniarski]] as Patrick \"Madman\" Kelly\n* [[James Karen]] and [[Gianni Russo]] as Christina's Advisors\n* [[Duane Martin]] as Willie's Agent\n* [[Pat O'Hara]] as Tyler Cherubini\n* [[Mazio Royster]] as Wide Receiver\n* [[Rick Johnson (quarterback)|Rick Johnson]] as Dallas Quarterback\n* [[Allan Graf]] as Referee\n* [[Margaret Betts]] as Mayor's Aide\n* [[Lester Speight]] as Sharks' Security Guard\n* [[Eva Tamargo]] as Tunnel Reporter - Game 3\n* [[Delia Sheppard]] and [[Jaime Bergman]] as Party Girls\n* [[Dan Sileo]] as Dallas Defensive Tackle\n* [[Sean Stone]] as Fan (as Sean C. Stone)\n* [[Antoni Corone]] as Fan\n;Cameos\n* [[Dick Butkus]]\n* [[Terrell Owens]]\n* [[Ricky Watters]]\n* [[Irving Fryar]]\n* [[Joe Schmidt (American football)|Joe Schmidt]]\n* [[Oliver Stone]]\n* [[Barry Switzer]]\n* [[Y. A. Tittle]]\n* [[Warren Moon]]\n* [[Johnny Unitas]]\n* [[Pat Toomay]]\n* [[Emmitt Smith]]\n* [[Wilt Chamberlain]] (uncredited)\n\n==Production==\n\n===Development===\nOliver Stone developed a script called ''Monday Night'' written by [[Jamie Williams (American football)|Jamie Williams]], a former [[tight end]] for the [[Nebraska Cornhuskers]] and later the [[San Francisco 49ers]], and Richard Weiner, a [[sports journalist]]. Stone separately acquired the [[spec script]] ''On Any Given Sunday'', by [[John Logan (writer)|John Logan]]. Stone later amalgamated a third screenplay, ''Playing Hurt'' by [[Daniel Pyne]], into the project.\n\nAs of May 1, 1999, the screenplay's cover page listed the following writers: original draft by Jamie Williams & Richard Weiner, John Logan, Daniel Pyne; subsequent revisions by [[Gary Ross]]; revisions by Raynold Gideon & [[Bruce A. Evans]]; revisions by John Logan; revisions by Lisa Amsterdam & [[Robert Huizenga]]; latest revisions by Oliver Stone.\n\nThe [[Writers Guild of America]] ultimately awarded screenplay credit to Logan and Stone, with \"story\" credit to Pyne and Logan. Williams and Weiner went uncredited for their original screenplay, but were credited for their work on the film as technical consultants.\n\nThe screenplay was also based in part on the 1994 book ''You're Okay, It's Just a Bruise: A Doctor's Sideline Secrets'' by Robert Huizenga. Huizenga was the intern doctor for the [[History of the Los Angeles Raiders|Los Angeles Raiders]] in their 1980s heyday, working under Dr. Robert T. Rosenfeld, who dismissed many players' injuries with the phrase, \"You're okay, it's just a bruise.\" James Woods' character was based on Rosenfeld, and his first diagnosis of \"Cap\" Rooney's career-threatening injury at the beginning of the film is \"you're okay, it's just a bruise.\" Huizenga left the Raiders in the early 1990s, disgusted at the way the medical advice was kept from players and Rosenfeld being allowed to continue treating them after several mishaps, one of which is closely mirrored in the film\u2014Shark's neck injury and risk of sudden death, based on the real-life [[Mike Harden]] case.\n\n===Casting===\n{{unreferenced section|date=October 2021}}\nDirector Oliver Stone's first two choices to play Tony D'Amato were Al Pacino and [[Robert De Niro]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ew.com/movies/2020/01/22/any-given-sunday-oral-history/|title='We were at war in South Beach': An oral history of 'Any Given Sunday'|website=[[Entertainment Weekly]]}}</ref> [[Henry Rollins]] was offered a role as a football player but turned it down as he felt he did not have the size to make the portrayal believable. [[Sean Combs|Sean \"P. Diddy\" Combs]] was cast as Willie Beamen, but dropped out amidst rumors he could not throw a football convincingly. Publicly Combs dropped off the project because of scheduling conflicts with his recording career. According to [[Cuba Gooding Jr.]], he met with Oliver Stone about playing the role of Willie Beamen but Stone turned Gooding down because he had already played a football player in ''[[Jerry Maguire]]'' (1996). [[Chris Tucker]] turned down the role of Willie Beamen.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vulture.com/2011/07/the-lost-roles-of-chris-tucker.html|title = The Lost Roles of Chris Tucker|date = 28 July 2011}}</ref> [[George Clooney]] was offered the role of Jack Rooney but turned it down.\n\nFive Pro Football Hall of Fame Players made cameo appearances as opposing head coaches. [[Bob St. Clair]] appears as the coach for Minnesota in the first game. [[Y. A. Tittle]], for Chicago, the second game. [[Dick Butkus]], with California, the road game. [[Warren Moon]], with New York in the rain soaked game. For the final game in Dallas, [[Johnny Unitas]] appears as the coach.\n\n[[Jim Caviezel]] played Tony D'Amato's estranged son, but his scenes were cut. They can be seen in the extras of the Oliver Stone Collection DVD. [[Tom Sizemore]] also had a role in the film, but it too was cut.\n\n===Principal photography===\nThe film was shot in [[Miami, Florida]] and [[Irving, Texas]]. Miami's [[Miami Orange Bowl|Orange Bowl]] stadium represents the home of the fictitious American football team, the Miami Sharks.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.misterhabs.com/TV_movie.htm |title=Television & Film Helmets |publisher=Misterhabs.com |access-date=2012-04-09 |archive-date=2011-07-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716140324/http://www.misterhabs.com/TV_movie.htm |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://mghelmets.com/movies.html |title=Movie/TV helmets |publisher=Mghelmets.com |access-date=2012-04-09 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714081535/http://mghelmets.com/movies.html |archive-date=2011-07-14 }}</ref> When the team traveled to California, the stadium used was [[Hard Rock Stadium|Pro Player Stadium]], which is located in Miami Gardens. [[Texas Stadium]] is used for the home of the fictitious Dallas Knights.\n\nDirector Oliver Stone requested, but did not receive, the [[National Football League]]'s permission to use real NFL team logos and stadiums for the film. As a result, the fictional Associated Football Franchises of America (AFFA) was created (not to be confused with the real [[American Football Association (1979\u20131982)|AFA]]). The AFFA apparently exists alongside the [[National Football League|NFL]], since the [[Miami Dolphins]] are mentioned.\n\nFor the scenes during a football game, production asked local schools to participate as extras for the film, including Lake Stevens Middle School in Miami, Florida. For each shot the crowd was asked to move around so that each section looked filled. In empty seats cardboard cutouts were placed in seats with balloons attached to them so that they would seem in motion.\n\nFor the practice scenes they used the baseball arena [[Homestead Sports Complex]].\n\nThe film also used [[Arena Football League]] players such [[Pat O'Hara]], who played for the [[Tampa Bay Storm]], later coached the [[Orlando Predators]] and is now an assistant coach with the [[Tennessee Titans]], and [[Connell Maynor]], who also played for the Orlando Predators and spent time as both a player and coach for the [[Philadelphia Soul]]. [[Bjorn Nittmo]], then with the AFL's [[Buffalo Destroyers]], was the Sharks' placekicker. Matt Martinez, a former Gurkha & ex-husband of [[Niki Taylor]] and linebacker for the AFL's [[Miami Hooters]], played himself, #31 for the Sharks.\n\n==Soundtrack==\n{{Main|Any Given Sunday (soundtrack)}}\n\nA soundtrack containing hip hop, rock and R&B music was released on January 4, 2000, by [[Atlantic Records]]. It peaked at #28 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] and #11 on the [[Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums]].\n\nOliver Stone wanted to use the music of the Canadian band [[Godspeed You! Black Emperor]] and actually filmed a scene using their music; when he later asked for permission the band said no, and Stone was forced to redo the scene without the music.\n\nFilm composer Richard Horowitz, who supplied the original score, published his complete music for the film on a promotional CD.<ref>RHCD 01, 1999 ([http://soundtrackcollector.com/catalog/soundtrackdetail.php?movieid=10200 ''Any Given Sunday''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716111641/http://soundtrackcollector.com/catalog/soundtrackdetail.php?movieid=10200 |date=2011-07-16 }} at soundtrackcollector.com).</ref>\n\n==Release==\n\n===Box office===\n''Any Given Sunday'' was a financial success; made on a budget of $55 million, it went on to earn  $100.2 million worldwide.<ref name=\"boxofficemojo.com\"/>\n\n===Reception===\n\n''[[Time Out New York]]''{{'}}s [[Andrew Johnston (critic)|Andrew Johnston]] wrote: \"It's often been said of films about sports that smaller balls equal better movies. ''Any Given Sunday'' explodes that theory, and not just because of the incredible intensity of its gridiron action. Oliver Stone's best movie in many years\u2014and one of his finest ever\u2014looks at the world of professional football from almost every conceivable angle, but it never tries to be the definitive statement on the subject. A surprisingly balanced film that merges Stone's hyperkinetic style with a character-centric narrative approach reminiscent of John Sayles and Robert Altman at their best, ''Sunday'' proves that powerful human drama and MTV visual pyrotechnics actually can coexist after all.\"<ref>Time Out New York, Dec. 30, 1999-Jan. 6, 2000, p. 87</ref>\n\n[[Roger Ebert]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' also gave the film a mostly positive review, awarding it 3 out of 4 stars, but criticized its length: \"I guess I recommend the movie because the dramatic scenes are worth it. Pacino has some nice heart-to-hearts with Quaid and Foxx, and the psychology of the veteran coach is well-captured in the screenplay by Stone and John Logan. But if some studio executive came along and made Stone cut his movie down to two hours, I have the strangest feeling it wouldn't lose much of substance and might even play better.\"<ref>[https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/any-given-sunday-1999 ANY GIVEN SUNDAY] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190424001455/https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/any-given-sunday-1999 |date=2019-04-24 }} ''Rogerebert.com'', Retrieved May 21, 2019</ref>\n\nConversely, [[Richard Schickel]] of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' criticized the story as being \"standard\" and stated \"(a)lmost three hours of this jitter deteriorates from bravura filmmaking to annoying mannerism, and Any Given Sunday ends up less than the sum of its many, often interesting parts.\"<ref name=\"rottentomatoes.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/any_given_sunday/reviews/?type=top_critics|title=Any Given Sunday - Movie Reviews - Rotten Tomatoes|website=www.rottentomatoes.com|access-date=2014-04-04|archive-date=2014-04-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407123504/http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/any_given_sunday/reviews/?type=top_critics|url-status=live}}</ref> Rick Groen of ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'' wrote that the story was \"(c)hoc-a-bloc with manly blather about sacrifice and honour and rugged individuals pulling together for the greater glory of the team.\"<ref name=\"rottentomatoes.com\"/> And, elaborating on many critics' shared observations<ref name=\"rottentomatoes.com\"/> that the movie was \"hyperkinetic\", Jack Matthews of the ''[[Daily News (New York)|New York Daily News]]'' states that \"the sensation we get from the blizzard of images and teeth-jarring sound effects is of having our head used as the football.\"\n\nThe film received an aggregated score of 52% from 122 reviews on [[Rotten Tomatoes]].

In actuality, the theatrical cut ran 162 minutes; 12 minutes were deleted for the director's cut, and six minutes of new footage were added. Stone said these changes were made to help with the film's pacing.{{citation needed|date=October 2021}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wikiquote}}\n* {{IMDb title|id=0146838|title=Any Given Sunday}}\n* {{Rotten Tomatoes|id=any_given_sunday|title=Any Given Sunday}}\n\n{{Oliver Stone}}\n{{John Logan}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:1999 films]]\n[[Category:1999 drama films]]\n[[Category:1990s English-language films]]\n[[Category:1990s sports drama films]]\n[[Category:American football films]]\n[[Category:American sports drama films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Oliver Stone]]\n[[Category:Films produced by Lauren Shuler Donner]]\n[[Category:Films produced by Clayton Townsend]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Robbie Robertson]]\n[[Category:Films set in Los Angeles]]\n[[Category:Films set in Miami]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Miami]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Texas]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by John Logan]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by Oliver Stone]]\n[[Category:Warner Bros. films]]\n[[Category:1990s American films]]"}]}}}}
