It tells the story of two children who trap their parents in their basement upon their plans for a separation as the other children they know get involved by trapping their respective problem parents as well.\n\nThe film was released on August 14, 1996 and went on to gross just over $7 million at the [[box office]]. The film was panned by critics.\n\nThe film was shot at various locations in the [[U.S. state]]s of [[California]] and [[Ohio]]. [[Monrovia, California]] was the location for several exterior house scenes while most interior shots were done at the CBS/Radford lot in [[Studio City, California]]. The story was set in [[Defiance, Ohio]], although another town, [[Chagrin Falls, Ohio]], actually doubled for it.\n\n==Plot==\nIn [[Defiance, Ohio]], the Beindorf family, consisting of Ned ([[Kevin Pollak]]), Janet ([[Jamie Lee Curtis]]), Grover ([[Kyle Howard]]), and Stacy (Amy Sakasitz), live a supposedly happy typical family life in the [[suburbs]] of [[Defiance, Ohio]]. In fact, Ned and Janet are not happy and are [[Marital separation|separating]], although they tell Grover and Stacy it is not a [[divorce]].\n\nGrover and Stacy first try to recreate their parents' [[honeymoon]] in the basement, but this fails to bring any happiness into their relationship. Grover and Stacy then leave the basement, telling Ned and Janet they must get another surprise for them upstairs. They go up, close the door, and nail it shut. They vow to keep it so until Ned and Janet work out their problems and get their marriage back on its feet.\n\nThe next day, Grover tells his best friend Matt Finley (Mooky Arizona) what he has done and T.J. Krupp (Russel Harper), the wealthy local bully, overhears them. Matt goes over to the Beindorfs' house to look at Grover and Stacy's work and is impressed. T.J. shows up to have a look and actually installs a newer, more secure door to keep Ned and Janet trapped.\n\nHe and Matt then leave to collect their parents and bring them there to lock them up as well. Matt's father Vic ([[Wallace Shawn]]), never keeps a wife for more than two years and is on his latest wife Louise ([[Caroline Aaron]]). T.J.'s father Donald ([[Christopher McDonald]]) does not treat his wife Gwenna ([[Sheila McCarthy]]) well. Matt also brings his bulldog Cosmo and two younger brothers Jimmy (Alex Seitz) and Teddy (Josh Wolford) who come armed with sleeping bags and T.J. brings his boa constrictor Spot. When Grover asks what is going on in response to his friends setting up camp at his house, T.J. replies with \"Our parents could be down there for months!\"\n\nNed and Janet almost talk Grover into letting them out, but Donald threatens him with legal action. Grover finds out that his dream girl Brooke Figler ([[Jennifer Love Hewitt]]) is also having parental problems: her mother Cindy ([[Jennifer Tilly]]) acts like a teenager, going so far as to trying to hang out with Brooke's friends. Grover invites her to lock Cindy up with the rest. The children begin to help their parents solve their problems. They try to find a way out of the basement while getting along and seeing what each of their problems are. The children also work out their differences with each other above. They eventually give in and up to the [[police]] led by Chief Rocco ([[Ray Walston]]). Their parents are set free.\n\nSome time later, Ned and Janet reconciled and took a second honeymoon to [[Hawaii]]. Vic and Louise's marriage lasted past the two-year mark and they are expecting another child. Donald and Gwenna got divorced, though she later went back to law school and they opened up a law firm together. Cindy started dating other men instead of intruding on Brooke's dates. Also, Grover and Brooke became sweethearts and she passionately kisses him in front of their classmates at school. He concluded that if his parents ever try to get divorced again, he might think of locking them in the attic.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Kevin Pollak]] as Ned Beindorf, the patriarch of the Beindorf family.\n* [[Jamie Lee Curtis]] as Janet Beindorf, the matriarch of the Beindorf family.\n* [[Kyle Howard]] as Grover Beindorf, the son of Ned and Janet who does his version of house arrest on the parents.\n* Amy Sakasitz as Stacy Beindorf, the sister of Grover who assists him in his plot.\n* Herbert Russell (as Russel Harper) as T.J.
