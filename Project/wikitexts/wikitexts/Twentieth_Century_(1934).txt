Through intensive training, Oscar transforms his prot\u00e9g\u00e9e into the actress \"Lily Garland\", and both she and the play are resounding successes. On opening night, after her triumph, he comes to her dressing room to apologize abjectly for his behavior to her. As planned, she falls into his arms, begging him never to leave her, and they become lovers.\n\nCut to three years later. Their partnership has spawned three more smash hits, and Lily has been recognized as a transcendent talent. As a couple, they are famous\u2014or infamous\u2014for their spectacular battles.\n\nThen Lily tries to break off their professional and personal relationship, fed up with Oscar's overpossesiveness and control of every aspect of her life. Oscar talks her out of it, promising to be more trusting and less controlling in the future. Instead, he secretly hires a private detective agency run by McGonigle to watch her every move, even to the point of [[Wiretapping|tapping her telephone]]. When she finds out, it is the last straw; she leaves for Hollywood and soon becomes a big movie star.\n\nWithout Lily, Oscar produces flop after flop. After one such disappointment, to avoid being imprisoned for his debts, he is forced to disguise himself to board the luxurious [[20th Century Limited]] express train travelling from [[Chicago]] to [[New York City]]'s [[Grand Central Terminal]]. By chance, Lily Garland boards the train at a later stop with her boyfriend George Smith ([[Ralph Forbes]]). After prevaricating, Oscar sees a chance to restore his fortunes and salvage his relationship with Lily.\n\nOscar schemes to get her to sign a contract with him. However, Lily wants nothing more to do with him. She is on her way to see Oscar's rival (and former employee), Max Jacobs ([[Charles Lane (actor)|Charles Lane]]), to star in ''his'' play. However, Oscar manages to get George to break up with her. Knowing that Lily offers him one last chance at professional success he tells her of his wish for her to play [[Mary Magdalene]] in his new play; \"sensual, heartless, but beautiful \u2013 running the gamut from the gutter, to glory \u2013 can you see her Lily? \u2013 the little wanton ending up in tears at the foot of the cross. I'm going to have [[Judas Iscariot|Judas]] strangle himself with her hair.\" Then Oliver thinks he has found somebody to finance Oscar's project, fellow passenger Mathew J. Clark ([[Etienne Girardot]]), not realizing that Clark is a harmless escapee from a mental asylum. When Oscar is slightly wounded in a scuffle with Clark, he pretends to be dying and gets a distraught Lily to sign his contract. The film ends with their first rehearsal, where Oscar reverts to his usual self, domineering a desperate Lily.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[John Barrymore]] as Oscar Jaffe\n* [[Carole Lombard]] as Lily Garland formerly Mildred Plotka\n* [[Walter Connolly]] as Oliver Webb\n* [[Roscoe Karns]] as Owen O'Malley\n* [[Ralph Forbes]] as George Smith\n* [[Charles Lane (actor)|Charles Lane]] as Max Jacobs (as Charles Levison)\n* [[Etienne Girardot]] as Mathew J. Clark\n* [[Dale Fuller (actor)|Dale Fuller]] as Sadie\n* [[Edgar Kennedy]] as Oscar McGonigle\n* [[Billie Seward]] as Anita\n\n==Production==\nThe genesis of ''Twentieth Century'' was ''Napoleon of Broadway'', a play by Charles Bruce Millholland about his experiences in working for the legendary and eccentric Broadway producer [[David Belasco]].<ref>TCM [http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title.jsp?stid=27561&category=Trivia \"Trivia: ''Twentieth Century''\"], tcm.com; accessed June 15, 2017.</ref>\n\nHis play was not produced, but it became the basis for the Hecht-MacArthur comedy, which lasted for 152 performances on Broadway, beginning on December 29, 1932,<ref name=ibdb/> and which they later adapted for the big screen. [[Howard Hawks]] was not the first choice; [[Roy Del Ruth]] and [[Lewis Milestone]] had been set to direct before Hawks got the job. Columbia tried to get [[William Frawley]] from the Broadway cast, but instead borrowed Roscoe Karns from [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]].<ref name=tcmnotes>TCM [http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title.jsp?stid=27561&category=Notes \"Notes: ''Twentieth Century''\"], tcm.com; accessed June 15, 2017.</ref>\n\nBefore Lombard was cast, Columbia boss [[Harry Cohn]] negotiated with [[Eugenie Leontovich]], who had played the part on Broadway, and then considered [[Gloria Swanson]] and [[Miriam Hopkins]]. Other reports say that Cohn also approached [[Ina Claire]], [[Tallulah Bankhead]], [[Ruth Chatterton]], [[Constance Bennett]], [[Ann Harding]], [[Kay Francis]] and [[Joan Crawford]]. However, Hawks believed that Lombard was a brilliant actress who had yet to be unleashed on film. He convinced a reluctant Columbia to borrow her from [[Paramount Studios]].{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}\n\nDuring Barrymore's initial reading with her, he looked to Hawks with an expression that showed he did not believe in Hawks' intuition. The rest of the production went dryly, with Lombard staggering through one scene after another and playing the same stoic characters that she had been taught to portray. Hawks took her aside and asked her what she was being paid for the film. Lombard told him and Hawks asked her what she would do if a man said \"something\" about her, coming up with an example from the back of his mind. Lombard said, \"I would kick him in the balls.\" Hawks said, \"Well, Barrymore said that, so why don't you kick him?\" Of course Barrymore had said nothing of the sort, but the plan worked and after Lombard yelped a few profanities, she continued through the shoot with an unforgettable vigor. For the remainder of her career\u2014until her tragic death in an airplane crash in 1942 at age 33\u2014before beginning a film, Lombard would always send a [[telegram]] to Hawks saying, \"I'm going to kick him!\"{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}\n\nLombard and Barrymore became friends during filming. When Barrymore's career was declining, Lombard raised hell to get him to work on her film ''True Confession'' (1937).{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}\n\n[[Preston Sturges]] was hired to write the screenplay around late November 1933, but was removed from the project a week later because he had not made sufficient progress.  Columbia then tried to get [[Herman Mankiewicz]] to write it, with [[Felix Young]] to produce.<ref name=tcmnotes/>\n\n''Twentieth Century'' \u2013 a title which Columbia considered changing because they feared that many westerners would not be familiar with the name of the train<ref name=tcmnotes/> \u2013 was in production February 22\u2013March 24, 1934.<ref>IMDB [https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0025919/business \"Business data: ''Twentieth Century''\"], IMDb.com; retrieved July 10, 2015.</ref>\n\nDuring the filming, there were some problems with the censors at the [[Hays Office]], who were concerned about the religious angle in the comedy of the film, and requested that it be toned down. [[Joseph Breen]], who ran the Office, worried that \"there will be serious difficulty in inducing an anti-Semitic public to accept a [motion picture] play produced by an industry believed to be [[Jewish]] in which the [[Passion Play]] is used for comedy purposes.\" The Office ultimately asked that one line be removed, which it was. They also requested that it be made less clear where Oscar jabs Lily with a pin.<ref name=tcmnotes/>\n\n''Twentieth Century'' was premiered in [[New York City|New York]] at [[Radio City Music Hall]] on May 3, 1934, and went into general release on May 11.<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0025919/releaseinfo ''Twentieth Century''], IMDb.com; retrieved July 10, 2015.</ref><ref>Brown, Gene.
