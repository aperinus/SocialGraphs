However, before he manages to accomplish his mission, the political situation changes drastically and the [[Service de Documentation Ext\u00e9rieure et de Contre-Espionnage|French secret service]] resorts to handing over Beaumont to the Malagawian authorities. After a long, unfair trial, during which Beaumont is injected with drugs, he is sentenced to long-term penal servitude at a \"re-education camp\".\n\nFollowing a daring escape with an African inmate, he returns to France and informs the French secret service of his presence, promising that he will kill Njala, who is in France for an official visit, thus getting his revenge on the people who betrayed him. The secret service responds by setting other agents on Beaumont's trail. However, he manages to remain one step ahead, humiliating and killing some of his major betrayers, including Rosen, the sadistic chief of the secret police. After Rosen falls in a gunfight, Beaumont takes Rosen's identity card and puts his dogtags on his body, spreading confusion within the secret service and temporarily reducing Njala's guard. Beaumont eventually tricks a secret service agent into shooting the dictator. While government officials confer with higher authorities, he slowly walks towards Njala's helicopter, but is shot dead by government agents, who have received the order to do so.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Jean-Paul Belmondo]] as Josselin \u201cJoss\u201d Beaumont\n* [[Robert Hossein]] as le commissaire Rosen\n* [[Bernard-Pierre Donnadieu]] as l'inspecteur Farges\n* [[Jean Desailly]] as le ministre\n* [[Cyrielle Clair]] as Alice Ancelin\n* [[Marie-Christine Descouard]] as Doris Frederiksen\n* [[Elisabeth Margoni]] as Jeanne Beaumont\n* [[Jean-Louis Richard]] as le colonel Martin\n* [[Michel Beaune]] as le capitaine Valeras\n* [[Pierre Saintons]] as le pr\u00e9sident N'Jala\n* [[Pascal N'Zonzi]] as Arthur\n* [[G\u00e9rard Darrieu]] as l'instructeur Picard\n* [[Sidiki Bakaba]] as le prisonnier \u00e9vad\u00e9\n* [[Dany Kogan]] as sergent Gruber\n* [[Marc Lamole]] as le serveur d'h\u00f4tel\n* [[Radisa ''Steve'' Jovanovic]] as a policeman\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|Film|France}}\n* [[Fran\u00e7afrique]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|id=0082949}}\n* {{AllMovie title|106526}}\n* {{Rotten Tomatoes|le-professionnel}}\n\n{{Georges Lautner}}\n{{Michel Audiard}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Professional, The}}\n[[Category:1981 action thriller films]]\n[[Category:1980s crime action films]]\n[[Category:1981 crime drama films]]\n[[Category:1980s crime thriller films]]\n[[Category:1981 films]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Ennio Morricone]]\n[[Category:French films about revenge]]\n[[Category:Films based on British novels]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Georges Lautner]]\n[[Category:Films set in Africa]]\n[[Category:Films set in France]]\n[[Category:Films set in Paris]]\n[[Category:Films set in a fictional country]]\n[[Category:French crime action films]]\n[[Category:French spy films]]\n[[Category:French crime drama films]]\n[[Category:French action thriller films]]\n[[Category:French crime thriller films]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by Jacques Audiard]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by Michel Audiard]]\n[[Category:Gaumont Film Company films]]\n[[Category:1980s French films]]"}]}}}}
