It was a live, televised remake of the 1978 film [[Grease (film)|''Grease'']], executive produced by [[Marc Platt (producer)|Marc Platt]], directed by [[Thomas Kail]], and starring [[Aaron Tveit]], [[Julianne Hough]], [[Carlos PenaVega]] and [[Vanessa Hudgens]].\n\nPatterned on similar live television musicals recently produced by [[NBC]], the production incorporated elements and songs from both the original stage musical and the [[Grease (film)|1978 film]] version of ''Grease'', as well as additional songs that were not present in either. In an effort to emulate the \"energy\" of a theatrical setting, live audiences were incorporated into the production's stagings. ''Grease Live'' was broadcast from [[Warner Bros. Studios, Burbank|Warner Bros. Studios]], utilizing two soundstages and the studio's outdoor [[backlot]]\u2014the usage of the latter was notably affected by rain in the Los Angeles area on the day of the broadcast.\n\nCritical reception was positive, with particular praise to the overall atmosphere and production style of the presentation, as well as the performances of the cast, particularly Hudgens as Betty Rizzo\u2014the special was dedicated in the memory of Hudgens' father, who had died from cancer one day prior to the broadcast. The special was nominated for ten [[Primetime Emmy Award]]s and won a total of five, including Outstanding Special Class Program.\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==History==\n\n===Announcement and casting===\nOn April 28, 2014, Fox announced that it had partnered with [[Paramount Television]] to produce a live, three-hour televised adaptation of the 1978 musical ''Grease'' in 2015.<ref name=Keveney>{{Cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/tv/2014/04/28/fox-to-stage-live-production-of-grease/8414769/|title=Fox to go live with 'Grease'|first=Bill|last=Keveney|date=April 28, 2014|access-date=February 1, 2016|work=[[USA Today]]}}</ref> The move came in the wake of similar live musical adaptations that had been produced by [[NBC]], such as ''[[The Sound of Music Live!]]'' and ''[[Peter Pan Live!]]''.<ref name=Keveney/><ref name=\"rollingstone-grease\" />\n\nOn January 17, 2015, Fox officially announced that [[Julianne Hough]] had been cast as Sandy and [[Vanessa Hudgens]] as Rizzo and that the special would air on January 31, 2016.

''Grease Live'' was presented to live studio audiences at each of the three filming locations, who were also directly integrated into relevant scenes as extras on-stage, such as in crowds.

Acknowledging that none of NBC's live musicals had \"hit the stratospheric highs of this show\", while aspects of the production were also praised, such as the live audiences and stage design. Vanessa Hudgens was judged to have \"stolen\" the show, and that Aaron Tveit and Julianne Hough \"couldn't be better matched as the head of the T Birds and the sweet new girl from Utah.\" In conclusion, Gerald felt that he had \"never seen a more inventive interplay between a show and just enough of the mechanics of the deal to make it all the more engaging. That, and the audience that played its essential part in moving ''Grease Live'' along with enthusiastic applause replacing the dead air that followed key moments in the earlier live broadcasts, set a new standard for this kind of presentation that will be tough to top.\"<ref name=\"deadline-review\"/>\n\n''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]''{{'}}s Maureen Ryan felt that the performance of Hough and Tveit was weak, explaining that \"when Danny has all the presence of a glass of milk and even the black-clad Sandy of the final scenes exudes all the sexual danger of a church choir director, well, rest assured that those concerned about the ''Grease'' legacies of [[John Travolta|Travolta]] and [[Olivia Newton-John]] have nothing to worry about.\" Despite this and other shortcomings, such as audio issues during \"Hopelessly Devoted to You\", and the \"surreality\" of the audience's presence in certain scenes, Ryan felt ''Grease Live'' got \"most of the big things right\", and that \"by incorporating a live audience, using creative staging and employing energetic camera work\", the production \"boasted an impressive sense of momentum and even spontaneity.\" Of the individual performances, Ryan praised Keke Palmer's, Hudgens', and Carly Rae Jepsen's vocal performances, Elle McLemore's \"simply terrific\" Patty, Kether Donahue's \"infectious joy\", and Ana Gasteyer's \"beautifully droll timing\" as Principal McGee. She concluded that \"If Fox can get the lead casting right in future and snag Kail again, audiences will surely be hopelessly devoted to the network\u2019s next live endeavor.\"<ref name=\"variety-review\">{{cite web|last1=Ryan|first1=Maureen|title=TV Review: 'Grease Live!'|url=https://variety.com/2016/tv/reviews/grease-live-review-fox-julianne-hough-aaron-tveit-1201693411|website=Variety|access-date=February 1, 2016}}</ref> Writing in ''[[USA Today]]'', Robert Bianco noted various positive and negative aspects of the broadcast. While he praised performances by the supporting cast, he lamented \"the progressive dumbing-down of the material. A Broadway musical that originally spoofed our rose-tinted-glasses view of the '50s has turned into a nostalgic wallow, leaving the show with an odd mix of tones \u2013 and in this particular version, a book that sometimes seemed to get lost between songs and inside jokes. ... it was often so flatly acted\" that the \"kinetic\", \"visually impressive\" musical numbers came as a \"much-needed relief\".
