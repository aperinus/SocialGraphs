The main role, Blade, is played by [[Maurizio Merli]]. Other central roles are played by [[John Steiner]], [[Sonja Jeannine]], [[Donald O'Brien (actor)|Donald O'Brien]], [[Philippe Leroy (actor)|Philippe Leroy]] and [[Martine Brochard]].\n\n==Plot==\nBounty hunter Blade (Maurizio Merli), who uses a [[Tomahawk (axe)|tomahawk]] as a throwing weapon, arrives at the mining town of Suttonville with the outlaw Burt Craven (Donald O'Brien) as his prisoner. His real motive is to kill mining big boss McGowan (Philippe Leroy) who has killed his father. Blade gives up his revenge \u2013 because McGowan \u201cis not worth it\u201d \u2013 and instead accepts to deliver the ransom for the mine owner's daughter (Sonja Jeannine). However, this mission fails because she turns out to be the lover of her kidnapper, McGowan's foreman Voller (John Steiner), who secretly works for a gang that regularly robs the shipments of silver from the mine. Voller then kills his boss and turns his mining empire into bloody chaos by massacring the mine workers. Blade is beaten up and buried up to his neck and left to be blinded by the sun. However, he survives and returns for a showdown with Voller.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Maurizio Merli]] as Blade (Mannaja)\n*[[John Steiner]] as Theo Voller\n*[[Sonja Jeannine]] as Deborah McGowan\n*[[Donald O'Brien (actor)|Donald O'Brien]] as Burt Craven\n*[[Philippe Leroy (actor)|Philippe Leroy]] as Ed McGowan\n*[[Martine Brochard]] as Angela\n*[[Salvatore Puntillo]] as Johnny\n*[[Antonio Casale]] as Dahlman\n*[[Enzo Fiermonte]] as agente del governo\n*[[Rick Battaglia]] as padre di Mannaja\n*[[Aldo Rendine]] as uomo derubato\n*[[Enzo Maggio]] as vecchietto\n*[[Sergio Tardioli]] as barista\n*[[Sophia Lombardo]] as Lucy\n\n==Music==\nThe film's score was composed and performed by [[Guido & Maurizio De Angelis]], whose soundtrack has been described as \"[veering] unpredictability between Italian Western ballads, contemporary [[pop music|pop]] songs, [[synthesizer|synth]]-led [[horror film|horror]] motifs and 1970s [[progressive rock|prog rock]]\".<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y7mrDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA218|title = Directory of World Cinema: Italy|isbn = 9781841505350|last1 = Bayman|first1 = Louis|date = January 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Release==\n''Mannaja'' was released in 1977.{{sfn|Curti|2013|p=212}} It grossed a 750 million [[Italian lire]] domestically in Italy.{{sfn|Curti|2013|p=212}}\n\n==Reception==\nIn his investigation of narrative structures in [[Spaghetti Western]] films, Fridlund ranges ''Mannaja'' among stories obeying the \"Tragic Mercenary\u201d plot where the pursuit of a monetary motive entails the killing or wounding of someone close to the hero, who then sets out on a vengeance mission. This story appears in the very influential ''[[Django (1966 film)|Django]]''. In the case of Blade his economic arrangement with the man he should have killed sets off a course of action leading to him being tortured and to the death of the showgirl Angela, who loves him. The situation where a kidnapped woman betrays her savior because she is the lover of her would-be abductor also appears in ''[[Ten Thousand Dollars for a Massacre]]'' - another \"Tragic Mercenary\u201d story.<ref>Fridlund, Bert: ''The Spaghetti Western.
