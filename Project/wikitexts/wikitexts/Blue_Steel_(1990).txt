Current word count is 762 words. -->\n[[New York City Police Department|NYPD]] cadet Megan Turner is shown to kill one suspect before succumbing to another in a training exercise. Following graduation from the police academy, on her first day of duty she shoots and kills a robber with her [[Service pistol|service]] [[revolver]] at a supermarket. The robber\u2019s [[Smith & Wesson Model 29]] revolver falls to the ground and lands directly in front of [[Commodity market|commodities trader]] Eugene Hunt, one of the customers lying on the floor. Unnoticed, Hunt takes the gun and slips away. Because the robber's weapon was not found at the scene and the other witnesses are unclear about seeing a handgun, Turner is accused of killing an unarmed man.\n\nWhile she attempts to clear her name with Assistant Chief Stanley Hoyt and her superiors, the suspended Turner begins dating Hunt, who has become obsessed with her. Unbeknown to Turner, Hunt has taken the gun and started committing random killings. At the first killing he leaves behind a spent shell on which he has carved Megan Turner\u2019s name.  Shortly thereafter, Hunt begins hearing voices telling him he is unique and to kill again.  One night, at his apartment he displays an unusual interest in Megan\u2019s gun and her shooting stance. He reveals that he was in the supermarket at the time of the robbery, and that he left with the perpetrator's gun and that he is the person behind the recent killings. Turner arrests him but he is freed by his attorney, Mel Dawson, due to a lack of concrete evidence.\n\nTurner fights to keep her badge and solve the murders with the help of Detective Nick Mann. Hunt arrives at her apartment, assaults her and shoots her best friend, Tracy, before rendering her unconscious with a blow to the head with the gun and then burying the gun in a park. Turner revives and goes to Hunt's apartment with Mann to arrest him, but Dawson prevents her from doing so and threatens to once more have her fired.\n\nSeeking comfort from her mother, Turner visits her family home, an uncomfortable place because her father physically abused her mother throughout her childhood. When she arrives, she finds that her mother is bruised. Enraged, Turner handcuffs her father and arrests him. During the drive they stop and talk in an attempt to finally put an end to his abuse. When they return to the house, Hunt is posing as a guest sitting with her mother. A tense exchange takes place between the two, where they both imply that they are armed. When he leaves, she goes to his apartment, where she spends the night staking him out.\n\nThe next morning, Turner follows Hunt to the park, where he has buried his gun. Mann interrupts another standoff between Hunt and Turner, where Megan is attempting to get Hunt to try for her gun and Hunt runs off. Believing that he will return for the murder weapon, they stake out the park. Turner sees the beam of a flashlight and assumes it is Hunt searching for the gun. She leaves the car to apprehend him, but not before handcuffing Mann to the steering wheel to prevent him from following her. The flashlight turns out to be a ruse: Hunt paid a homeless woman to decoy the police. Back at the car, Hunt is outside the car holding Mann at gunpoint and is about to kill him. Turner appears and fires her gun, shooting Hunt in the left arm before he escapes in traffic.\n\nMann and Turner return to her apartment, where unbeknownst to them, Hunt is patching up his wound in her bathroom. The pair have sex and Mann is ambushed by Hunt and shot when he goes to the bathroom. Turner does not hear the shot because it was muffled by a towel. Hunt attacks and rapes Megan and she eventually kicks him away and gets her hands on her gun and shoots at him, but he flees. Mann is unconscious and taken to the hospital, where Turner is told that he will make it.\n\nDetermined to find Hunt and finish him off, Turner knocks out her police guard, then takes his uniform and gun. She wanders the streets and Hunt follows her into the subway. Turner and Hunt are both shot and the gun fight carries on out to the street. She finally shoots and kills him after a long and violent confrontation in the middle of [[Wall Street]] after running him down with an abandoned car and him running out of bullets. Other police arrive and she is taken away in an ambulance.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Jamie Lee Curtis]] as Officer Megan Turner\n* [[Ron Silver]] as Eugene Hunt\n* [[Clancy Brown]] as Detective Nick Mann\n* [[Elizabeth Pe\u00f1a]] as Tracy Perez\n* [[Louise Fletcher]] as Shirley Turner\n* [[Philip Bosco]] as Frank Turner\n* [[Richard Jenkins]] as Dawson\n* [[Kevin Dunn]] as Assistant Chief Stanley Hoyt\n* [[Tom Sizemore]] as Robber\n* [[Mary Mara]] as Wife\n* Skipp Lynch as Instructor\n* [[Mike Hodge]] as Police Commissioner\n* [[Mike Starr (actor)|Mike Starr]] as Superintendent\n\n== Reception ==\n=== Box office ===\n''Blue Steel'' [[premiere]]d at the [[Sundance Film Festival]] in [[Park City, Utah]] in January 1990.<ref name=\"NYT review\">{{Cite news |title=Critic's Notebook; Hollywood Tactics Invade the Sundance Festival |date=February 5, 1990 |page=11 |first=Caryn |last=James |author-link=Caryn James |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/02/05/movies/critic-s-notebook-hollywood-tactics-invade-the-sundance-festival.html |accessdate=May 13, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150525192220/https://www.nytimes.com/1990/02/05/movies/critic-s-notebook-hollywood-tactics-invade-the-sundance-festival.html |archive-date=May 25, 2015 |url-status=live}}</ref> The film was not a box office success.<ref>{{cite news|title= Weekend Box Office: 'Red October' Doing Fine in March |work= [[Los Angeles Times]]|url= http://articles.latimes.com/1990-03-20/entertainment/ca-469_1_box-office|access-date=2012-06-05}}</ref>\n\n=== Critical response===\nOn [[Rotten Tomatoes]] the film has an approval rating of 75% based on reviews from 28 critics.
