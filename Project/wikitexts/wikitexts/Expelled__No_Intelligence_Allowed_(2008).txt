We civilised men, on the other hand, do our utmost to check the process of elimination; we build asylums for the imbecile, the maimed, and the sick; '''we institute poor-laws; and our medical men exert their utmost skill to save the life of every one to the last moment.

Thus the weak members of civilised societies propagate their kind. No one who has attended to the breeding of domestic animals will doubt that this must be highly injurious to the race of man. '''It is surprising how soon a want of care, or care wrongly directed, leads to the degeneration of a domestic race; but excepting in the case of man himself,''' hardly any one is so ignorant as to allow his worst animals to breed.\n\n'''The aid which we feel impelled to give to the helpless is mainly an incidental result of the instinct of sympathy, which was originally acquired as part of the social instincts, but subsequently rendered, in the manner previously indicated, more tender and more widely diffused. Nor could we check our sympathy, if so urged by hard reason, without deterioration in the noblest part of our nature. The surgeon may harden himself whilst performing an operation, for he knows that he is acting for the good of his patient; but if we were intentionally to neglect the weak and helpless, it could only be for a contingent benefit, with a certain and great present evil. Hence we must bear without complaining the undoubtedly bad effects of the weak surviving and propagating their kind; but there appears to be at least one check in steady action, namely the weaker and inferior members of society not marrying so freely as the sound; and this check might be indefinitely increased, though this is more to be hoped for than expected, by the weak in body or mind refraining from marriage.'''<ref name=\"SixThings3\" /><ref>{{harvnb|Darwin|1871|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&itemID=F937.1&pageseq=181 168\u2013169]}}</ref><ref name=\"sciamMine\">{{cite podcast |url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/podcast/episode/61D30BEB-A65E-7583-BB264FABBD4CD879/ |title=Never You Mine: Ben Stein's Selective Quoting of Darwin |website=60-Second Science |publisher=Scientific American |last=Mirsky |first=Steve |access-date=2016-01-11}}</ref>}}\n\nAccording to John Moore writing for the Canadian ''[[National Post]]'':\n\n{{quotation|text=Stein quotes from a passage in Darwin's writing that appears to endorse the notion that for a species to thrive the infirm must be culled.
