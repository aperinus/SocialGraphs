Bo soon goes on a quest to get revenge on the gang for almost killing him and his family.\n\n''Paparazzi'' was released on September 3, 2004 in the United States.\n\n==Plot==\nRising Hollywood movie star Bo Laramie finally achieves major success with his latest film ''Adrenaline Force''. After the film's premiere, a persistent group of unscrupulous photographers\u2014Kevin Rosner, Leonard Clark, Wendell Stokes and their leader Rex Harper\u2014harass Bo and his wife Abby, along with their 8-year-old son Zach. When Bo takes Zach to soccer practice, he eyes Rex taking photos of Zach and confronts him, leading Rex to provoke Bo into punching him, caught on camera by his fellow photographers. Bo is sued as a result and is placed into anger management. Meanwhile, Rex vows to destroy Bo and those close to him.\n\nAs Bo, Abby and Zach return from an event, Rex and his crew drive up beside them, in four different vehicles, and blind them by taking pictures. Bo's car is hit by a pickup truck while Rex and his crew snap photos of the wreck they caused. While Bo is not seriously injured, Abby's [[spleen]] is removed and Zach is placed in a coma.\n\nBo is told by LAPD detective Burton that the paparazzi each gave him the same story of finding the wreck after it happened, with no witnesses to dispute their claims. Some time later, Bo accidentally causes Kevin to wipe out on his motorcycle, careening onto a precipice. Bo tries to save him, but when Kevin gloats that they'll put his family through hell, Bo lets him fall to his death.\n\t\nBo makes Leonard his next target, secretly placing a prop gun in the jacket left in Leonard's car, whilst Leonard invades Bo's movie set and is ejected by security. Following him, Bo calls 911, and describes Leonard's car, saying that the driver is waving a gun. Leonard is pulled over and, reaching into his jacket for his ID, instead pulls out the prop gun, causing the cops to shoot him dead.\n\nConvinced Bo will target them next, Rex and Wendell break into Bo's house to plant cameras inside. Abby runs into Wendell, who assaults her and threatens to kill Zach if she tells the police. Burton assigns Deputy Walker and Deputy Wilson to provide extra security, but Bo sneaks out past the two deputies and into Wendell's house, discovering the feed from the cameras.\n\nWendell arrives at his home where Bo confronts him with a baseball bat. In the morning, Bo puts the car back where it was at, and races to beat Burton, on his way to the house. Burton shows Bo a video taken by a camera in a button of Leonard's shirt on the movie set, and thinks someone planted the gun in Leonard's coat. Rex soon finds Wendell beaten to death, and Bo planted the bat in Rex's houseboat to frame him.\n\nBurton realizes traffic camera footage will prove what really happened at Bo's crash, along with the testimony of Emily, who was with Rex at the event, prompted by her guilt to come forward. At Wendell's house, Burton notices the video feed from the cameras in Bo's house and Rex entering with a gun. Rex goes to Bo and Abby's bedroom and opens fire, only for Bo to hit Rex and throw him to the floor.\n\nBo viciously beats Rex, gloating about how he got his revenge. Rex is finally arrested, adding to a charge that he had previously harassed and raped Emily, and relentlessly photographed by paparazzi as he is led away. Later, as Bo is finishing filming, he's called to the hospital, where Zach has awakened from his coma. Bo, Abby and Zach later attend at the premiere of Bo's newest film, a sequel to ''Adrenaline Force'', and Abby is now pregnant with a girl. After the film, Bo meets the press out front, taking a paparazzi's jibe at him in his stride.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Cole Hauser]] as Bo Laramie\n* [[Robin Tunney]] as Abby Laramie, Bo's wife.\n* [[Dennis Farina]] as Detective Burton\n* [[Daniel Baldwin]] as Wendell Stokes\n* [[Tom Hollander]] as Leonard Clark\n* [[Kevin Gage (actor)|Kevin Gage]] as Kevin Rosner\n* Blake Michael Bryan as Zach Laramie, Bo and Abby's 8-year-old son.\n* [[Tom Sizemore]] as Rex Harper\n* [[Forry Smith]] as Deputy Walker\n* [[Donal Gibson]] as Deputy Wilson\n\n[[Mel Gibson]], who was one of the film's producers, appears as an [[anger management]] patient in the waiting room of their shared therapist.
