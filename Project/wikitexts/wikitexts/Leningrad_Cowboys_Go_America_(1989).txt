Their manager Vladimir tries to promote them, but nobody seems to like their music, except for the mute village idiot, Igor. They are encouraged to move to [[United States|America]], for people will \"buy anything\" there. They depart for [[New York City|New York]], bringing with them a band member who had frozen the previous night while practicing outside. Igor, who was not invited to come with them, stows away in the plane's baggage hold.\n\nThey arrive at the [[CBGB]] bar in [[Manhattan]]. An agent first suggests they should play at Madison Square Garden or Yankee Stadium, but after hearing their music, offers them a gig at a wedding in Mexico instead. He also recommends that they change their musical style to [[rock and roll]]. They buy a used 1975 [[Cadillac Series 70|Cadillac Fleetwood 75]] Limousine, strap the coffin carrying their frozen band member onto the roof and set off to earn their way through the [[Deep South]], adapting their musical style to suit local tastes at each new location. All the while they are being driven on and exploited by Vladimir, who hoards the money, takes most of the food for himself and hides beer in the ice-filled coffin. Meanwhile, Igor follows the band by his own means of transportation. When he finally catches up with them, the band members have revolted against Vladimir and tied him up, but Igor frees him and becomes the band's road manager.\n\nDuring the trip, the band spends time in jail, has their car engine stolen, causes a nightclub to close after playing an unsuccessful show, and reunites with a long-lost cousin whose singing earns them positive reception from the audience. They eventually make it to Mexico and perform their wedding gig, where Igor revives the thawing bass guitarist with a shot of tequila and joins the group on stage. Vladimir watches them play then wanders off, but the band finally finds success in Mexico, making the top ten.\n\n==Cast==\nMain actors:{{sfnp|Nestingen|2013|pp=154-155}}\n*[[Matti Pellonp\u00e4\u00e4]] as Vladimir Kuzmin (manager)\n*[[Kari V\u00e4\u00e4n\u00e4nen]] as The Mute (Igor)\n*[[Jim Jarmusch]] as car salesman\n*[[Richard Boes]] as rock promoter\n*The [[Leningrad Cowboys]] (Sakke Jarvenp\u00e4\u00e4, Heikki Keskinen, [[Sakari Kuosmanen]], Puka Oinonen, Silu Sepp\u00e4l\u00e4, Mauri Sum\u00e9n, Malto Valtonen, Pekka Virtanen){{sfnp|Canby|1990}} as themselves\n*[[Nicky Tesco]] as lost cousin\n\nThe film includes cameos by blues guitarist [[Duke Robillard]]{{sfnp|Dunne|2002}} and American [[rockabilly Hall of Fame]]r [[Colonel Robert Morris]] with his wife Irene.{{sfn|Barretta}}\n\n==Production==\nThe idea to create the [[Leningrad Cowboys]] as an absurd band came from [[Sleepy Sleepers]] members Sakke J\u00e4rvenp\u00e4\u00e4 and Mato Valtonen, who asked Kaurism\u00e4ki to direct a music video for them in 1986. Kaurism\u00e4ki directed the short film ''[[Rocky VI (1986 film)|Rocky VI]]'' (1986) and the Leningrad Cowboys videos ''Thru the Wire'' (1987) and ''L.A.
