Based on the [[Salmon Fishing in the Yemen (novel)|2007 novel of the same name]] by [[Paul Torday]], and a screenplay by [[Simon Beaufoy]], the film is about a [[fisheries]] expert who is recruited by a consultant to help realise a sheikh's vision of bringing the sport of [[fly fishing]] to the [[Yemen]] desert, initiating an upstream journey of faith to make the impossible possible. The film was shot on location in [[London]], England, [[Scotland]] and [[Morocco]] from August to October 2010.<ref name=\"bbc\">{{cite web|title=Shooting commences on Salmon Fishing in the Yemen |work=BBC Press Office |date=6 August 2010 |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2010/08_august/06/yemen.shtml |access-date=2 December 2012}}</ref> The film premiered at the [[2011 Toronto International Film Festival]].<ref>{{Cite web|last=Punter |first=Jennie |date=26 July 2011 |url=https://www.variety.com/article/VR1118040405?refCatId=13 |title=Toronto unveils first pix |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |access-date=26 July 2011}}</ref> The film received generally positive reviews upon its release,<ref name=\"rotten-tomatoes\"/><ref name=\"metacritic\"/> and earned over $34 million in revenue worldwide.<ref name=\"bo\"/>\n\n==Plot==\nFisheries expert Alfred Jones ([[Ewan McGregor]]) receives an email from financial adviser Harriet Chetwode-Talbot ([[Emily Blunt]]), seeking advice on a project to bring [[salmon]] fishing to the [[Yemen]]\u2014a project being bankrolled by a wealthy Yemeni [[sheikh]] and supported by the [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office]] (the FCO). Alfred dismisses the project as \"fundamentally unfeasible\" because the Yemen cannot provide the necessary environment for salmon. Meanwhile, the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|British Prime Minister]]'s press secretary, Patricia Maxwell ([[Kristin Scott Thomas]]), suggests the salmon fishing story to the Prime Minister's office as a positive story to help improve relations between Britain and the [[Islamic world]].\n\nAlfred meets with Harriet to discuss the project, but despite Harriet correcting his misconceptions of the Yemen environment, Alfred is convinced that the project is foolhardy. Alfred's boss, pressured by Patricia, forces Alfred to accept a position on the project. Alfred considers resigning rather than ruin his reputation in the scientific community, but is convinced by his wife that they need his income and pension.\n\nHarriet arranges for Alfred to meet the Sheikh ([[Amr Waked]]) at his estate in the [[Scottish Highlands]]. The Sheikh is excited to meet Alfred as he is the inventor of the \"Woolly Jones\" fishing fly.<ref name=\"dvd\">{{cite AV media|people=Lasse Hallstr\u00f6m (director) |title=Salmon Fishing in the Yemen (subtitles) |medium=DVD |publisher=SONY Pictures |year=2011}}</ref> While the Sheikh acknowledges that the project may sound crazy, he still believes that fishing is a noble pursuit that promotes harmony and requires immense faith.\n\nAfter his wife accepts a position in [[Geneva]], Alfred devotes himself to the salmon project. Although painfully shy,{{#tag:ref|Alfred exhibits some symptoms associated with [[Asperger syndrome]], an autism spectrum disorder (ASD) characterized by significant difficulties in social interaction, and restricted and repetitive patterns of behavior and interests.<ref name=\"spence\">{{cite web |last=Spence |first=J.P. |date=22 March 2012 |url=http://www.topangamessenger.com/story_detail.php?ArticleID=5108 |title=Film Interview: Salmon Fishing in the Yemen |work=Topanga Messenger |access-date=22 March 2012 |archive-date=18 May 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130518150315/http://www.topangamessenger.com/story_detail.php?ArticleID=5108 |url-status=dead }}</ref> In one scene, Harriet mocks his overly-formal behavior as a sign of Asperger's.|group=Note}} he enjoys working with Harriet and they begin to make progress. Their enthusiasm is interrupted, however, when Harriet learns that her new boyfriend, [[British special forces]] Captain Robert Meyers ([[Tom Mison]]), is missing in action. Devastated, Harriet withdraws to her apartment. When Alfred visits her, she gets upset, thinking he just wants her to return to work, but then she realises he has come to comfort her, and the two embrace.\n\nMeanwhile, the Sheikh continues his work, despite radicals who accuse him of introducing Western ways to their region. Patricia informs the Sheikh that because of opposition to removing salmon from British rivers they will need to use farmed salmon. The Sheikh does not believe that salmon bred in captivity will survive and rejects Patricia's offer, ending the British Government's involvement in the project. Alfred resigns his government job to continue with the project.\n\nAfter a confrontation with his wife in which he realises that their marriage is over and that he is in love with Harriet, Alfred convinces the Sheikh to give the farmed salmon a try. As the two are fishing, a Yemeni radical attempts to assassinate the Sheikh, who is saved by Alfred casting his fishing line towards the assassin. Soon after, they return to the Yemen, where Harriet and Alfred continue to grow closer. After a moonlight swim, he asks her if there was a \"theoretical possibility\" of the two of them ending up together. She accepts with a kiss on his cheek, but says she will need some time.\n\nAt a press conference in the Yemen, with the [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|Foreign Secretary]], Patricia reunites Harriet with her boyfriend Robert who has survived the counter-terrorism operation. The [[Public relations|PR]] stunt leaves Alfred heartbroken. That night, Harriet realises her feelings for Robert have changed, and when Alfred gets a text message from his wife asking him to return, he declines.\n\nThe following day the fish are released from their holding tanks. The fish swim upstream, and everyone celebrates the success of the project. While Robert and the Foreign Secretary fly-fish for the photographers, terrorists break into the dam upstream and open the flood gates. Although most people survive the resulting flash flood, the valley is left in ruins. The Sheikh blames himself for the tragedy, and vows to rebuild\u2014this time with the support of the local community.\n\nThe next day, as Harriet prepares to leave with Robert, the latter says while she was the one thing on his mind that kept him alive during his mission, she doesn't owe him anything. She approaches Alfred to say goodbye, where he tearfully wishes her luck as he ponders what to do next. Just then, they see a salmon jumping from the water, indicating that some fish survived. Alfred tells Harriet he will indeed stay and help them rebuild. Harriet asks if he will need a partner\u2014and Alfred realises that she is talking about herself. They embrace, and then hold hands while looking out over the river.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col}}\n*[[Ewan McGregor]] as Alfred \"Fred\" Jones\n*[[Emily Blunt]] as Harriet Chetwode-Talbot\n*[[Kristin Scott Thomas]] as Patricia Maxwell\n*[[Amr Waked]] as Sheikh Muhammed bin Zaidi bani Tihama\n*[[Tom Mison]] as Robert Mayers\n*[[Conleth Hill]] as Bernard Sugden\n*[[Rachael Stirling]] as Mary Jones\n*[[Catherine Steadman]] as Ashley\n*[[Hugh Simon]] as Foreign Secretary\n*[[Clive Wood]] as Tom Price-Williams\n*Tom Beard as Peter Maxwell \n*[[Nayef Rashed]] as Rebel Leader\n*[[Otto Farrant]] as Joshua Maxwell \n{{Div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n\n===Screenplay===\nThe screenplay for ''Salmon Fishing in the Yemen'' was written by [[Simon Beaufoy]], based on the novel by Paul Torday. The [[epistolary novel]] won the 2007 [[Bollinger Everyman Wodehouse Prize]], and the 2008 [[Waverton Good Read Award]]. Through a series of letters and documents, Torday creates a political satire that focused more on the \"art of political spin\" than on the force of the human spirit.<ref name=\"topanga\">{{cite web |last=Spence |first=J.P. |title=Film Interview: Salmon Fishing in the Yemen |work=Topanga Messenger |date=22 March 2012 |url=http://www.topangamessenger.com/story_detail.php?ArticleID=5108 |access-date=5 December 2012 |archive-date=18 May 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130518150315/http://www.topangamessenger.com/story_detail.php?ArticleID=5108 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Beaufoy enjoyed the challenge of transforming a fairly complex novel written in an unusual format\u2014a series of emails, text messages, interviews, and testimony extracts\u2014into a film. Beaufoy acknowledged, \"I just love adapting material that allows room for creativity and allows room for me to be very present in the process, I suppose. Sometimes when you\u2019re adapting something classic and famous you have to adopt a different attitude, to something like Salmon Fishing where it had such an unusual narrative and such an unusual structure, that you got quite a {{Sic|free rei|gn}} to do interesting things with it.\"<ref name=\"film-stage\">{{cite web|last=Anton |first=Mike |title=Simon Beaufoy Interview |work=The Film Stage |date=12 March 2012 |url=http://thefilmstage.com/features/interview-salmon-fishing-in-the-yemen-writer-simon-beaufoy-talks-adaptation-process-the-hunger-games-more/ |access-date=5 December 2012}}</ref> Beaufoy integrated the emails, text messages, and chat texts into the film's narrative.\n\nBeaufoy's screenplay is decidedly different from the novel in several respects. The most obvious difference is that his press secretary is a woman, played by Kristin Scott Thomas, whereas in the novel, the character is a man, Peter Maxwell.<ref name=\"novel\">{{cite book|last=Torday |first=Paul |title=Salmon Fishing in the Yemen |publisher=Mariner |location=New York |year=2007 |isbn=978-0156034562}}</ref> Where the novel focuses on political satire, the film is more about a man who decides to change direction in his life.<ref name=\"topanga\"/> In the novel, Jones is noticeably older than the film character, and the romantic subplot with Harriet is kept in the background because of the political satire. By making Jones younger, Beaufoy added a \"quirky flair\" to the character that gives the audience a \"completely different experience in watching a man overcome himself to achieve happiness.\"<ref name=\"topanga\"/> Beaufoy noted, \"That's the difference when reading the book. You can perceive specific conflicts, but when it's onscreen you have to create something different, something the audience can see and feel and root for.\"<ref name=\"topanga\"/>\n\n===Casting===\nFor director Lasse Hallstr\u00f6m, Ewan McGregor and Emily Blunt were his \"first choices\" to play the leading roles. \"They brought the lightness and the humour to the material,\" Hallstr\u00f6m later observed.<ref name=\"indiewire\">{{cite web|last=Toro |first=Gabe |title=Lasse Hallstrom Talks 'Salmon Fishing in the Yemen' |work=IndieWire |date=8 March 2012 |url=http://blogs.indiewire.com/theplaylist/lasse-hallstrom-wont-return-for-planned-sequel-to-the-hypnotist-will-shoot-safe-haven-this-spring |access-date=6 December 2012}}</ref> He also felt fortunate to get Kristin Scott Thomas to play the role of the bossy press secretary, Patricia Maxwell, recalling, \"I knew she could be funny, as most actors can, but she brought that seriousness combined with a bit of heart.\"<ref name=\"indiewire\"/> For Hallstr\u00f6m, it was that combination of humour and seriousness that allowed the actress to capture the balance between the film's sentiment and political satire.<ref name=\"indiewire\"/> Egyptian actor Amr Waked was cast in the role of the sheikh.

''Salmon Fishing in the Yemen'' is less a classic fish-out-of-water tale than a fish-in-strange-waters tale, a study in diametric opposites that finds unexpected synchronies and moments of almost mystical harmony.
