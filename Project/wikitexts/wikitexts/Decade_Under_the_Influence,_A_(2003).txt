The website's consensus reads, \"Packed with amusing anecdotes and told through the perspective of those it lionizes, ''A Decade Under the Influence'' is too one-sided to serve as a comprehensive dissection of 1970s American film, but will still work a treat for movie buffs.\"<ref>[https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/decade_under_the_influence/ Rotten Tomatoes]</ref>\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=15em}}\n* [[Robert Altman]]\n* [[John G.
