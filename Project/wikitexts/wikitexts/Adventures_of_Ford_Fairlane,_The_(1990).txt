True to his name, Ford drives a 1957 [[Ford Fairlane 500 Skyliner]] in the film.\n\nThe film's main character was created by writer Rex Weiner in a series of stories that were published as weekly serials in 1979\u201380 by the ''New York Rocker'' and the ''LA Weekly''. The stories were published as a book by Rare Bird Books in July 2018.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The (Original) Adventures of Ford Fairlane: The Long Lost Rock n' Roll Detective Stories|last1=Weiner|first1=Rex|last2=Schwartz|first2=Andy|last3=Levin|first3=Jay|last4=Mutrux|first4=Floyd|date=2018-07-17|publisher=Rare Bird Books, A Vireo Book|isbn=9781945572807|edition= Original |location=S.l.|language=en}}</ref>\n\n[[DC Comics]] produced a prequel miniseries of [https://www.mycomicshop.com/search?TID=268031 the same name]\n\nThe film was both a commercial and critical failure, being awarded the [[Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Picture]], tying with [[Bo Derek]]'s ''[[Ghosts Can't Do It]]''. However, [[Billy Idol]]'s \"[[Cradle of Love (Billy Idol song)|Cradle of Love]]\" from the soundtrack became one of his biggest hits on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] (peaking at #2). \n\n==Plot==\n[[Ford Fairlane]] is seen sitting on a beach smoking as the film opens. A flashback initiates, showing a roaring crowd at a concert<ref>{{Cite web|title=FORD FAIRLANE FILMING Red Rocks Amphitheatre|url=https://www.redrocksonline.com/events/1896/|access-date=2020-07-10|website=Redrocksonline.com|language=en-US}}</ref> at [[Red Rocks Amphitheatre]] in Morrison, Colorado, given by fictional popular heavy metal band The Black Plague. Lead singer Bobby Black makes an eccentric entrance down a zip-line from Creation Rock onto the stage and begins performing. Shortly into one of the band's songs, Bobby Black starts gagging and collapses dead on stage.\n \nAfter the lead singer of The Black Plague is murdered onstage, shock-jock Johnny Crunch, an old friend who came west with Fairlane, hires Ford to track down a mysterious teenage groupie named Zuzu Petals, who may have a connection to Black's death.\n\nSoon after hiring Fairlane, Crunch is electrocuted on the air. The world's hippest detective soon finds himself trading insults with ruthless record executive Julian Grendel, a clueless cop and former disco star, Lt. Amos, a merciless hit man named Smiley and countless ex-girlfriends out for his blood. Aiding and abetting Fairlane is loyal assistant Jazz and a hip record producer at the head of a bizarre lineup of suspects, victims, beautiful women, and a koala as he finds himself hip-deep in the case of his life.\n\nThe [[MacGuffin]] of the film is three data CDs which, when read simultaneously, detail the illegal dealings of Julian Grendel, who was getting rich from bootlegging his record company's music and murdered Bobby Black when he found out Black had acquired the CDs with the incriminating evidence. Both of Fairlane's beloved possessions, his house and his car, are blown to bits, courtesy of Grendel.\n\nThe first disc was with Colleen Sutton, the second with Zuzu Petals, and the third disc was hidden under the star for [[Art Mooney]] on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]].\n\nIt is later revealed that Grendel killed Bobby Black and Johnny Crunch, as he considered them both greedy and stupid because they wanted more money for their involvement in pirating CDs to sell to the highest bidder, making Grendel Records and the rest of the music industry corrupt. However, Fairlane kills Grendel by setting him on fire with a flammable alcoholic milkshake and a cigarette. Jazz leaves Fairlane, knowing how ungrateful he is for everything that has happened. Smiley shows up and plans to kill Ford, but not before revealing that he killed his young neighbor's [the Kid's] father. Ford distracts him and kills Smiley with a [[sleeve pistol]]. Jazz and Ford decide to reconcile, while the Kid decides to join their detective agency. Ford wins a million-dollar radio contest and buys a yacht. He sails away with Jazz, the Kid and the koala (now in a neck brace). They're all now one big happy family.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Andrew Dice Clay]] as Ford Fairlane\n* [[Wayne Newton]] as Julian Grendel\n* [[Priscilla Presley]] as Colleen Sutton\n* [[Lauren Holly]] as Jazz\n* [[Brandon Call]] as The Kid\n* [[Maddie Corman]] as Zuzu Petals\n* [[David Patrick Kelly]] as Sam the Sleaze Bag\n* [[Morris Day]] as Don Cleveland\n* [[Robert Englund]] as Smiley\n* [[Ed O'Neill]] as Lt.

The members of the fictional band Black Plague are played by professional musicians: [[Vince Neil]], lead singer of [[M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce]]; [[Ozzy Osbourne]] bassist [[Phil Soussan]] and drummer [[Randy Castillo]]; and [[Quiet Riot]] guitarist Carlos Cavazzo. Richie Sambora's contribution to the soundtrack was a cover of the [[Jimi Hendrix]] song \"Wind Cries Mary\". [[Yello]]'s \"Unbelievable\" samples dialogue from the film, although a phone number given as \"1-800-Perfect\" is changed to \"1-800-Unbelievable\". Not appearing on the soundtrack is \"Booty Time\", the song that [[Ed O'Neill]]'s character performs during the film.\n\nYello is also credited with the film's \"[[Film score|music score]]\", and an early cut of their album ''[[Baby (Yello album)|Baby]]'' is used as the film's incidental soundtrack. Barry McIlheney in ''Q'' magazine was critical of the collection and only highlighted the Billy Idol contribution while giving the overall release 2 out 5 stars.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal |last=McIIheney |first=Brian |date=5 March 1991 |title=The Adventures of Ford Fairlane OST |journal=Q Magazine |volume=55 |pages=80}}</ref>\n\n==Release==\n===Critical response===\nThe film received generally negative reviews upon release.
