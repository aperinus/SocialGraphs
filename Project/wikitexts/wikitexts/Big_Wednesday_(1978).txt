Written by Milius and Dennis Aaberg, it is loosely based on their own experiences at [[Malibu, California]]. The picture stars [[Jan-Michael Vincent]], [[William Katt]], and [[Gary Busey]] as California [[Surfing|surfers]] facing life and the [[Vietnam War]] against the backdrop of their love of [[surfing]].\n\nRaised in [[Southern California]], Milius made ''Big Wednesday'' as an homage to the time he spent in [[Malibu, California|Malibu]] during his youth. Milius and his friends [[George Lucas]] and [[Steven Spielberg]] famously agreed to exchange a percentage point of ''Big Wednesday'', ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'' and ''[[Close Encounters of the Third Kind]]'' prior to the release of the three films throughout 1977-1978. Spielberg in particular was certain that ''Big Wednesday'' was going to be a box office hit, opining it was like \"''[[American Graffiti]]'' meets ''[[Jaws (film)|Jaws]]''\", two of the decade's most successful films.<ref>[https://www.deadline.com/2010/05/how-steven-spielberg-and-george-lucas-caught-surf-bug-and-waved-bye-to-points-on-close-encounters-and-star-wars/ Deadline.com (May 12, 2010)]. Accessed: August 7, 2013.</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nThe film tells the story of three young friends whose passion in life is surfing. The friends include: Matt Johnson, a self-destructive type who has a devil-may-care attitude; Jack Barlow, the calm and responsible one of the bunch; and Leroy \"The Masochist\" Smith, whose [[nickname]] tells a lot about his personality.\n\nTheir surfing lives are traced from the summer of 1962, to their attempts at dodging the Vietnam War draft in 1965 (including faking [[insanity]], [[homosexuality]], and all manner of medical ailments), and to the end of their innocence in 1968 when one of their friends is killed in Vietnam. The three make the difficult transition to adulthood with parties, surf trips, marriage, and the war.\n\nThe friends reunite years later, after Barlow has served in Vietnam, for the \"Great Swell of '74\".  With this reunion, the transition in their lives becomes the end point of what the 1960s meant to so many as they see that the times have changed, and what was a time of innocence is gone forever.\n\n==Cast==\n<!--- main (6) and co-starring (5) cast and order per opening and closing tombstone credits, roles per closing credits scroll --->\n* [[Jan-Michael Vincent]] as Matt\n* [[William Katt]] as Jack\n* [[Gary Busey]] as Leroy\n* [[Patti D'Arbanville]] as Sally\n* [[Lee Purcell]] as Peggy Gordon\n* [[Sam Melville (actor)|Sam Melville]] as \"Bear\"\n* [[Darrell Fetty]] as \"Waxer\"\n* [[Robert Englund]] as \"Fly\"\n* [[Barbara Hale]] as Mrs. Barlow\n* [[Fran Ryan]] as Lucy\n* [[Reb Brown]] as \"Enforcer\"\n* [[Joe Spinell]] as Psychologist\n\nIn addition, two-time [[Billabong Pipeline Masters|Pipeline Masters]]<!--- not yet Billabong in the years he was champ ---> champion [[Gerry Lopez]], who served as one of the six surfing masters in the production of the film, also appears in a cameo as himself during the final surfing section of the film.\n\n==Production==\n===Script===\nMilius wrote the script with his friend and fellow surfer, journalist Denny Aaberg.<ref>{{cite news |title=THE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF SURFING |url=https://www.surfer.com/features/encyclo/ |access-date=30 August 2022 |work=SURFER Magazine |date=22 July 2010}}</ref> It was inspired by a short story Aaberg had published in a 1974 ''Surfer Magazine'' entitled \"No Pants Mance\",<ref>New York Surf Film Festival.

That's important to me because I'm a real surfer. So's John.\"<ref name=\"big\"/>\n\n\"A lot of things [in the film] happened to me,\" said Milius. \"A lot of the characters are me and in another sense none of them are me. It took an awful long time to write the script. It is so very personal. It's about growing up and relationships and the surf is the exotic background. We all knew it was special, we knew it wouldn't last. And we knew how good we had it. Surfing is a strange thing. A lot of people never leave it. You always feel you owe it something. It was a central experience in our lives. It's all changed now.\"<ref name=\"big\"/>\n\nMilius described the film in a 1976 interview:\n<blockquote>It's a surfing HOW GREEN WAS MY VALLEY: the loss of an aristocracy, the end of an era, the passing of a more innocent time to a more corrupt and complex one-all growing up is the passing of innocence. It's based on the lives of three friends ten years ago. It's about their friendship, and the value of friendship. I don't think that kids today have the same kind of values that these people had then; I don't see movies being made about that kind of thing. This movie is about friendship: surfing is just the background. It's about love of a place, love of a time, love of your human contacts, and the loss of those things. It's the most personal film I'll probably ever make, and I figured I ought to do it now, before I get too far away from it. At least half the people who participated are dead now. The attrition rate among surfers is very high. A lot of them died in Vietnam and OD'd on dope.<ref name=\"comment\">{{cite news|title=STOKED|last=Thompson|first= Richard|newspaper= Film Comment 12.4|date=July\u2013August 1976|pages= 10\u201321}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n\"Because I surfed, I'm the only director in the world who could have made his picture,\" said Milius. \"And I can tell you, it's so hard, no one will ever make it again.\"<ref name=\"john\">{{cite news |last1=Lindsey |first1=Robert |title=THE NEW NEW WAVE OF FILM MAKERS |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1978/05/28/archives/the-new-new-wave-of-film-makers-a-young-group-of-writerdirectors.html |access-date=30 August 2022 |work=The New York Times |page= SM3 |date=28 May 1978 |quote=A young group of writer-directors has moved into positions of power in Hollywood.

There was a lot of pressure to make it more like ''[[Animal House]]'', but the movie has a huge following now because it did have loftier ambitions.

The logo, a red diamond with a bear in it, features prominently throughout the movie, on shop windows,  T-shirts, car windows and on surfboards. The first boards were shaped in 1977, by famous board shaper Bill Hamilton. The international distribution of the movie promoted the Bear label worldwide, with people wanting boards with the bear logo. The brand morphed into an actual successful company after the release of the movie, producing hundreds of boards, and is still active today, with various people producing Bear-branded boards in different countries.<ref>{{cite web | website=BoardRiderStickers.com | title=Bear Surf | url=http://www.boardriderstickers.com/surfing/bear-surf}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title=Bear Surfboards: History | publisher=Bear Surfboards | url=http://www.bearsurfboards.com/history-brand/ | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181127172948/http://www.bearsurfboards.com/history-brand/ | archive-date=2018-11-27}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | website=Roger Hinds Surfboards | title=Bear Surfboards | url=https://www.rogerhindssurfboards.com/bear-surfboards/ | url-access=limited}}</ref>\n\n==Release==\nThe film premiered in wide release in the [[United States]] on May 26, 1978.<ref>{{cite news | title = Battling Waves -- and Reputation | url = https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/165833857/ | work = Los Angeles Times | date = May 22, 1978 | access-date = December 5, 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe picture was screened at various film festivals, including: the Davao City Film Festival, [[Philippines]]; the Turin Film Festival, [[Italy]]; and others.\n\nA 20th Anniversary screening (which included cast and crewmembers) took place at the Newport Film Festival in 1998.<ref name=\"Warshaw\"/>\n\n==Reception==\n===Box office===\n''Big Wednesday'' was a box office flop upon its release, and was quickly pulled from theatres after taking in only $4.5 million.<ref name=\"Warshaw\"/> William Katt explained in a 1979 interview with [[Roger Ebert]] a year after the film's release that he believed the movie's failure was due to the marketing focusing only on the fight scenes and surfing angle.<ref name=ebert>{{cite news|last=Ebert|first=Roger|title=Interview with William Katt|url=https://www.rogerebert.com/interviews/interview-with-william-katt |access-date=August 7, 2013|newspaper=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]|date=June 3, 1979|author-link=Roger Ebert}}</ref>\n\n===Critical response===\n[[Janet Maslin]], film critic for ''[[The New York Times]]'', did not like the performances of the actors and wrote, \"The surprise is not that Mr. Milius has made such a resoundingly awful film, but rather that he's made a bland one...the movie often seems even more uneventful than material like this need make it, and Mr. Milius's attention to his actors focuses more closely on their pectorals than on their performances.

And the climactic showdown between the heroic trio and the monster waves is so good it makes up for the rest (the trio's ''[[The Wild Bunch|Wild Bunch]]''-inspired walk to destiny is by far Milius's finest cinematic moment)...
