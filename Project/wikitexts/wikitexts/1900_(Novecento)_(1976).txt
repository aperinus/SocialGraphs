The peasants on an estate in [[Emilia-Romagna]] are shown attempting to join the partisans and place the owner of the estate, Alfredo Berlinghieri, under arrest. A middle-aged man named Attila and woman named Regina are seen attempting to flee the farm but are attacked by women labourers wielding pitchforks.\n\nThe narrative moves back to the start of the century. Both born on the day of the death of composer [[Giuseppe Verdi]] \u2013 27 January 1901 \u2013 Alfredo Berlinghieri and Olmo Dalc\u00f2 come from opposite ends of the social spectrum. Alfredo is from a family of wealthy landowners led by his popular grandfather (also called Alfredo or Alfredo the Elder) and grows up with his cousin Regina. Olmo is an illegitimate peasant born to an unmarried young woman who already has had several children. His grandfather, Leo, is the foreman and peasants' spokesman who carries out a duel of wits with the elder Alfredo which masks a deep-seated mutual respect. As Alfredo is somewhat rebellious and despises the falseness of his family, in particular his weak but abusive and cynical father Giovanni, he befriends Olmo, who has been raised as a [[Socialism|socialist]]. During this time, Leo leads strikes against the unfair conditions on the farm.\n\nThe two are friends throughout their childhood, despite the social differences of their families, and spend much time in one another's company. Olmo enlists with the Italian army in 1917 [[Italy in the First World War|during World War I]] and goes off to fight while Alfredo learns how to run his family's large plantation under the guidance of his father. Olmo returns from the war over a year later and his friendship with Alfredo continues. However, Giovanni, the ''padrone'' since the elder Alfredo's suicide, has hired Attila Mellanchini as his [[Ranch foreman|foreman]]. Taken with [[fascism]] in a similar way that Giovanni has been, Attila eventually incorporates his new belief system in his dealings with the Berlinghieri workers; he treats them cruelly, and wins Regina and Giovanni over to his side. In the 1920s, Olmo enters into a relationship with Anita, a down-to-earth woman who shares his enthusiasm for the cause of [[workers' rights]]. Together, Olmo and Anita lead several fervent protests against the landowners.\n\nFollowing the death of Giovanni, Alfredo becomes the new ''padrone'' and marries Ada, a gorgeous, demure Frenchwoman. During the 1930s, he proves to be a weak ''padrone'', repeatedly bending to the whim of the fascists. Ada sinks into alcoholism when confronted with the reality of the emptiness of her marriage to Alfredo; she sympathises to some extent with the workers and despises Alfredo for his failure to stand up to Attila.\n\nMeanwhile, Olmo's wife Anita dies in childbirth, but manages to bring another member into the community; a daughter whom Olmo names after his late wife. Olmo's daughter, Anita the Younger, grows into a young and resourceful teenager who is supportive of her father's socialist beliefs. As Olmo takes on his fateful role of leader among the poor farmers and their families, he clashes several times with Attila. The latter, whose [[psychopathy|psychopathic]] tendencies have been revealed via the murders of a cat and a small boy (the latter at Alfredo and Ada's wedding and for which Olmo was initially blamed), commits further atrocities such as killing the elderly Mrs. Pioppi in order to steal her land and home. However, he becomes a fresh target of ridicule at the hands of the peasants; led by Olmo, they take turns throwing manure at him after Attila tries to sell Olmo like a slave. Olmo flees to keep from being killed by the fascists, and Attila reacts to the humiliation by tearing up Olmo's house with his [[blackshirts]] before caging the peasants on the Berlinghieri compound and indiscriminately shooting them. Alfredo fires Attila, but discovers that Ada has already left him.\n\nThe story comes full circle when the power shifts [[Liberation of Italy|after World War II in 1945]], and the ruling class is at the mercy of the jovial yet bitter farm labourers. Attila and Regina, having been apprehended, are imprisoned in the Berlinghieri pigsty, and the women peasants cut off Regina's hair. Attila gleefully confesses to the murders he has committed over the years and is executed on the spot. Olmo returns to the farm in time to see Alfredo being brought before a workers' tribunal to stand trial. Many workers come forth and accuse Alfredo of letting them suffer in squalor while he profited from their labours, although he did not support fascism. Alfredo is sentenced to death, but his execution is prevented after Olmo explains that the ''padrone'' is dead, so Alfredo Berlinghieri is alive, suggesting that the social system has been overthrown with the end of the war. As soon as the verdict is reached, however, [[CLNAI|representatives and soldiers of the new government]], which represents the [[Italian Communist Party|Communist Party]], [[Christian Democracy (Italy)|Christian Democrats]], [[Action Party (Italy)|the Action Party]], [[Italian Liberal Party|Liberals]], and [[Italian Socialist Party|Socialists]] arrive and call on the peasants to turn in their arms. Olmo convinces the peasants to do so, overcoming their scepticism. Alone with Olmo, Alfredo declares \"The ''padrone'' is alive\", indicating the struggle between the working and ruling classes is destined to continue.\n\nThe film ends with Alfredo and Olmo playfully tackling each other as they did in their childhood, then the scene suddenly jumps forward several years to the present day with the elderly Alfredo and Olmo walking along a railway track. Alfredo lies down in the center of the tracks as his younger self would do as a game while a train would run over the tracks, but Alfredo would emerge unharmed as he would lie perfectly still. Alfredo appears to lay himself across the tracks as a train approaches in a clear attempt at suicide as if he has chosen to end his life at that time. The final shot shows the train traveling over the younger Alfredo lying perfectly still in the center of the tracks.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Robert De Niro]] as Alfredo Berlinghieri\n** Paolo Pavesi as young Alfredo\n* [[G\u00e9rard Depardieu]] as Olmo Dalc\u00f2\n** Roberto Maccanti as young Olmo\n* [[Dominique Sanda]] as Ada Chiostri Polan\n* [[Francesca Bertini]] as Sister Desolata\n* [[Laura Betti]] as Regina\n* [[Donald Sutherland]] as Attila Mellanchini\n* [[Stefania Sandrelli]] as Anita Foschi\n* {{ill|Werner Bruhns|de}} as Ottavio Berlinghieri\n* [[Stefania Casini]] as Neve\n* [[Sterling Hayden]] as Leo Dalc\u00f2\n* {{ill|Anna Henkel|de|Anna Henkel-Gr\u00f6nemeyer}} as Anita Dalc\u00f2, Olmo's daughter\n* [[Ellen Schwiers]] as Amelia\n* [[Alida Valli]] as Signora Pioppi\n* [[Burt Lancaster]] as Alfredo the Elder\n* [[Romolo Valli]] as Giovanni Berlinghieri\n* [[Giacomo Rizzo]] as Rigoletto\n* [[Pippo Campanini]] as Don Tarcisio\n* Antonio Piovanelli as Turo Dalc\u00f2\n* [[Paulo Branco]] as Orso Dalc\u00f2\n* [[Li\u00f9 Bosisio]] as Nella Dalc\u00f2\n* [[Maria Monti]] as Rosina Dalc\u00f2\n* [[Anna Maria Gherardi]] as Eleonora\n* Demesio Lusardi as Montanaro\n* Pietro Longari Ponzoni as Pioppi\n* [[Jos\u00e9 Quaglio]] as Aranzini\n* [[Clara Colosimo]] as Giovanna\n* Vittorio Fanfoni as Fanfoni\n* [[Edda Ferronao]] as Stella's Daughter\n{{div col end}}\n\n=== Dub voices (Italian version) ===\n* [[Ferruccio Amendola]] as Alfredo Berlinghieri\n* [[Giuseppe Rinaldi]] as Alfredo the Elder\n* [[Renato Mori]] as Leo Dalc\u00f2\n* [[Claudio Camaso|Claudio Volont\u00e9]] as Olmo Dalc\u00f2\n* [[Antonio Guidi]] as Attila Mellanchini\n* [[Rita Savagnone]] as Ada Chiostri Polan\n* [[Riccardo Cucciolla]] as Ottavio Berlinghieri\n* Paila Pavese as Amelia\n* Rossella Izzo as Anita Dalc\u00f2, Olmo's daughter\n\n==Release==\nThe original [[director's cut]] of the film runs 317 minutes (5 hours, 17 minutes) and was released in two parts in Italy.<ref name=fox/> [[Alberto Grimaldi]], the film's producer, was contractually obligated to deliver a 195-minute (3 hour, 15 minute) version to [[Paramount Pictures]] for release in the United States and Canada.

In 2006, Paramount surrendered the NC-17 rating of the uncut version, then released it as unrated on DVD on 5 December 2006.
