It was directed by [[Gary Fleder]] and written by [[Anthony Peckham]] and Patrick Smith Kelly.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1991, a gang of thieves steal a rare $10-million gem, but, in the process, two of the gang double-cross their leader, Patrick Koster, and take off with the precious stone.\n\nTen years later, on the day before [[Thanksgiving]], prominent Manhattan private practice child [[Psychiatry|psychiatrist]], Dr. Nathan R. Conrad, is invited by his friend and former colleague, Dr. Louis Sachs, to examine a \"disturbed\" young lady named Elisabeth Burrows at the state [[sanatorium]].\n\nHaving been released from prison two weeks earlier, Patrick and the remaining gang members break into an apartment which overlooks Nathan's apartment, where he lives with his wife Aggie and daughter Jessie. He is informed by Patrick that Elisabeth is only pretending to be insane to hide out in the institution from this gang that is searching for the gem. That evening, Patrick kidnaps Jessie as a means of forcing Nathan to acquire a six-digit number from Elisabeth's memory. As Nathan visits Elisabeth, she is reluctant at first, but he gains her trust later{{snd}}especially when he reveals the situation with Jessie. Sachs admits to Nathan that the gang who kidnapped Jessie also kidnapped his girlfriend to force him to acquire the number from Elisabeth. Sachs is then visited by Detective Sandra Cassidy, who reveals to him that his girlfriend has been found dead. Meanwhile, Aggie hears Jessie's voice and realizes the kidnappers reside in the nearby apartment. The kidnappers send one of them to kill Aggie while the others escape with Jessie, but Aggie sets an ambush and kills him.\n\nAfter Nathan takes Elisabeth out of the sanatorium, she remembers certain events regarding the gang. It is revealed that Elisabeth's father was the gang member who double crossed the others and kept the gem. However, other members of the gang later found him and ordered him to reveal where he had hidden the gem, subsequently pushing him in front of a subway train. The gang members were arrested immediately, and Elisabeth escaped with her doll in which the gem was hidden. She also remembers that the required number, 815508, is the number of her father's grave at [[Hart Island (New York)|Hart Island]] and that her doll is placed beside him in the coffin. She explains that she had stowed away on a boat that was taking her father's coffin for burial in Potter's field on Hart Island, where the gravediggers put the doll, named Mischka, inside.\n\nNathan and Elisabeth steal a boat to reach Hart Island. The gang members track them down and demand that Nathan give them the number they want. Elisabeth reveals the number and Patrick orders his companion to exhume her father's coffin after releasing Jessie. He finds the doll and the gem hidden inside it. He then decides to kill Nathan and Elisabeth, but Cassidy arrives before he can shoot them. Patrick's companion is shot by Cassidy, but Patrick manages to wound her. Taking advantage of the confusion, Nathan takes the gem from Patrick and throws it to a nearby excavation machine. Nathan kicks Patrick into the grave, and then triggers the mechanism which covers Patrick with earth, burying him alive. Nathan reunites with Aggie and Jessie, and invites Elisabeth to live with them.\n\n==Cast==\n<!--- [[WP:NOTDATABASE]] - cast and order per opening tombstone credits, roles per closing credits scroll --->\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Michael Douglas]] as Nathan Conrad\n* [[Sean Bean]] as Patrick Koster\n* [[Brittany Murphy]] as Elisabeth Burrows\n* [[Skye McCole Bartusiak]] as Jessie Conrad\n* [[Guy Torry]] as Dolen\n* [[Jennifer Esposito]] as Sandra Cassidy\n* [[Shawn Doyle]] as Russel Maddox\n* [[Victor Argo]] as Sydney Simon\n* [[Conrad Goode]] as Max\n* [[Paul Schulze]] as Jake\n* [[Lance Reddick]] as Arnie\n* [[Famke Janssen]] as Aggie Conrad\n* [[Oliver Platt]] as Louis Sachs\n}}\n\n==Production==\nAn earlier version of the script did not feature the investigation side-plot set around Detective Sandra Cassidy. Although the film is entirely set in New York, shooting took place in winter 2000 in both New York and [[Toronto]]. Due to the film's release nearly three weeks after the [[September 11 attacks]], the filmmakers contemplated delaying the movie, but ultimately decided against it. However, they cut out and replaced shots of the [[World Trade Center (1973\u20132001)|World Trade Center]] from the edit, such as the opening shot, which now instead shows [[Brooklyn]].<ref>{{cite AV media |title=Don't Say a Word DVD commentary |last=Fleder |first=Gary |date=12 October 2001 |publisher=[[20th Century Fox]]}}</ref>\n\n==Soundtrack==\nThe film's musical score was composed by [[Mark Isham]]. The soundtrack was released on cd from Var\u00e8se Sarabande that contains eight score selections from various scenes, including Heist, Kidnapped and the horrific events at Subway.\n\n1 \tHeist \t6:02\n2 \tElisabeth \t4:40\n3 \tKidnapped \t4:28\n4 \tA Body \t1:37\n5 \tHart Island \t3:38\n6 \tSubway \t4:06\n7 \tMishka \t3:13\n8 \tA Family \t3:24\n\n==Reception==\n===Critical response===\n{{Anchor|Critics}}\n''Don't Say a Word'' received poor reviews from critics. [[Rotten Tomatoes]] gives the film a score of 24% based on 114 reviews. The site's consensus states: \"''Don't Say a Word'' is slick and competently made, but the movie is routine and stretches believability with many eye rolling moments.\"<ref>{{cite web\n| title = Don't Say a Word (2001)\n| url = http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/dont_say_a_word/\n| work = [[Rotten Tomatoes]]\n| publisher = [[Flixster]]\n}}</ref> [[Metacritic]] gives the film a generally unfavorable review with a score of 38% based on 32 reviews.<ref>[http://www.metacritic.com/movie/dont-say-a-word Don't Say a Word on].
