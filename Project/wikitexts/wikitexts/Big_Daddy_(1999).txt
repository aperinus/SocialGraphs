It stars Sandler, [[Joey Lauren Adams]], [[Jon Stewart]], [[Rob Schneider]], [[Dylan and Cole Sprouse]]  and [[Leslie Mann]]. The plot follows Sonny Koufax, a 32-year-old man who gets dumped by his girlfriend for not accepting responsibility. Sonny then tries to be responsible by adopting a five-year-old boy named Julian who appears on his doorstep.\n\nReleased on June 25, 1999, the film opened at No. 1 at the [[box office]] with a $41.5 million gross in its first weekend. It went on to be the [[1999 in film|seventh highest-grossing film of 1999]], and was Sandler's highest-grosser domestically until ''[[Hotel Transylvania 2]]'' (2015).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/people/chart/?id=adamsandler.htm|title=Adam Sandler Movie Box Office Results|website=www.boxofficemojo.com|language=en|access-date=2018-02-11}}</ref> The film was nominated for five [[Golden Raspberry Awards|Razzies]] and Sandler won the Worst Actor category.<ref name=\"Razzie\">{{cite web |url=http://www.razzies.com/forum/1999-razzie-nominees-and-winners_topic5534.html |title=1999 RAZZIE Nominees & \"Winners\" |publisher=Golden Raspberry Foundation |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121206081327/http://www.razzies.com/forum/1999-razzie-nominees-and-winners_topic5534.html |archive-date=December 6, 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nIn [[New York City]], Sonny Koufax is a 32-year-old slacker and law school graduate who hasn't taken the [[Bar examination|bar exam]], works one day a week as a toll booth attendant, and lives off a $200,000 compensation from a minor accident. His girlfriend Vanessa threatens to break up with him unless he takes more responsibility. His roommate Kevin Gerrity proposes to his [[podiatrist]] girlfriend Corinne Maloney before he leaves for China to work on a case for his law firm, and she accepts. Corinne vehemently dislikes Sonny, including him constantly teasing her about her former job at [[Hooters]].\n\nThe next day, Sonny wakes up to find Julian McGrath, a five-year-old left at their apartment. A note states that his mother is no longer able to care for him and that Kevin is his biological father. Sonny contacts Kevin, who is puzzled by the news. Despite his selfishness and lack of parenting skills, Sonny assures him that he will take care of Julian until Kevin returns from China. To win Vanessa back, Sonny introduces her to Julian. However, he discovers that she is now dating Sid, an elderly man whom, despite being 36 years her senior, she reveres as more motivated and intelligent, with a \"five-year plan\".\n\nPosing as Kevin, Sonny takes Julian to his social worker Arthur Brooks, telling him that Julian should return to his mother. However, Brooks informs Sonny that Julian's mother died of cancer. Sonny then decides to raise Julian his own way. They develop a strong bond, and Julian helps Sonny find a new girlfriend in Corinne's lawyer sister Layla. Brooks finds a foster home for Julian and leaves messages for Sonny, but is suspicious when he does not respond.\n\nAt a meeting at Julian's school, Sonny rethinks his parenting methods after Julian's teacher complains about the habits he has developed due to Sonny's influence. He turns Julian's behavior around, but then Brooks arrives to find out Sonny impersonated Kevin, and threatens to arrest him if he does not hand over Julian. Sonny complies but contacts Layla to help take legal action.\n\nIn court, numerous people, including Corinne, testify on Sonny's behalf and tell the judge he is a good father. Julian also testifies and provides information regarding his heritage. Sonny then calls himself to the stand and asks his lawyer father Lenny, visiting from Florida, to question him. Despite Lenny's fervent belief that he is not father material, Sonny convinces him that he will not fail at being a father. Impressed by Sonny's sincerity, Lenny vouches for him. Nonetheless, the unconvinced judge orders Sonny's arrest. Kevin, realizing he truly is Julian's biological father, refuses to press charges against Sonny. Kevin is granted custody of Julian, and Sonny promises him that he will always be there for him. He then passes Julian to Kevin, and they start to bond.\n \nOne year later, Sonny has completely turned his life around: he is a successful lawyer, is married to Layla, and they have a child of their own. Sonny is given a surprise birthday party at a [[Hooters]], attended by his friends, including Julian, who is happy in his new family with Kevin and Corinne (and often meets up with Sonny for activities, such as basketball). Sonny then encounters Vanessa working there as a waitress with Sid working as a cook, revealing that his \"five-year plan\" did not go as she had hoped. Everyone but a frustrated Vanessa celebrates Sonny's birthday.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Adam Sandler]] as Sonny Koufax, an unmotivated slacker who works in a tollbooth, despite having his law degree, and becomes Julian's guardian.\n* [[Joey Lauren Adams]] as Layla Maloney, a lawyer, and Corinne's sister.
