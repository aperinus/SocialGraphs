A joint American and British production, the film is a sequel to ''[[Prometheus (2012 film)|Prometheus]]'' (2012), the second entry in the [[Alien (franchise)#Prequel series|''Alien'' prequel series]], and the sixth installment in the [[Alien (franchise)|''Alien'' franchise]] overall, three of which have been directed by Scott. The film features returning star [[Michael Fassbender]], with [[Katherine Waterston]], [[Billy Crudup]], [[Danny McBride]], and [[Demi\u00e1n Bichir]] in supporting roles. It follows the crew of a colony ship that lands on an uncharted planet and makes a terrifying discovery.\n\nIn 2012, before the release of ''Prometheus'', Ridley Scott discussed the prospects of a sequel and new trilogy, and this film was confirmed that August. [[Principal photography]] began on April 4, 2016, at [[Milford Sound]] in [[Fiordland National Park]], New Zealand, and wrapped on July 19, 2016. Effects houses Odd Studios and CreatureNFX provided the film's makeup and [[Animatronics|animatronic]] creature effects. Scott said the first cut of the film was two hours and 23 minutes long, which was eventually edited down to the 2 hours and 3 minutes of the released version.\n\n''Alien: Covenant'' premiered in London on May 4, 2017. It was released on May 12 in the United Kingdom, and on May 19 in the United States. The film received generally positive reviews from critics, but underperformed at the box office; its worldwide gross was $240 million against a production budget of approximately $100 million, not including marketing costs.\n\n== Plot ==\n<!-- Per [[WP:FILMPLOT]] plot summaries should be between 400-700 words. -->\nIn a prologue,{{efn|Set before the events of the prequel film ''Prometheus''.}} business magnate [[List of Alien characters#Peter Weyland|Peter Weyland]] speaks with his newly-activated [[Android (robot)|android]] in a lakeside apartment. The android chooses the name \"[[David 8|David]]\" for himself after observing [[David (Michelangelo)|Michelangelo's statue]]. Weyland states that one day they will search for mankind's creator together. David comments on his unlimited lifespan as compared to Weyland's, which unsettles Weyland.\n\nIn 2104 [[Common Era|AD]], 11 years after the ''[[Prometheus (2012 film)|Prometheus]]'' expedition, the [[Space colonization|colonization]] ship ''Covenant'' is seven years from reaching planet Origae-6 with 2,000 colonists in [[Cryopreservation|stasis]] and 1,140 human embryos in cold storage. The ship is monitored by [[Walter One|Walter]], an advanced android model that physically resembles David.

The ship's captain, Jake Branson, is burned alive when his stasis pod malfunctions. While repairing the ship, the crew picks up a transmission of a human voice from a nearby planet, which appears eminently more habitable than Origae-6. Despite the protests of Daniels, Branson's widow, that this new \"perfect\" planet is too good to be true, the new captain, Christopher Oram, decides they will investigate.\n\nWith pilot Tennessee maintaining ''Covenant'' in orbit, his wife Faris flies a lander to the planet's surface, where an expedition team tracks the transmission's signal to a crashed alien ship. Crewmembers Ledward and Hallett are infected by spores from fungus-like organisms. Oram's wife, Karine, helps the rapidly deteriorating Ledward back to the lander, where Faris quarantines both inside the med-bay. A small pale alien creature ([[Alien (creature in Alien franchise)#Neomorph|neomorph]]) bursts from Ledward's back, killing him and mauls Karine to death. Faris attempts to kill the creature with a shotgun, but inadvertently triggers an explosion that kills her and destroys the lander. Nearby in the fields, another neomorph bursts from Hallett's mouth, killing him. The creatures attack the remaining crew, killing crew member Ankor. The remaining crew kills one neomorph before David, who survived the ''Prometheus'' mission, appears and scares off the other.\n\nDavid leads the crew to a temple in a city full of dead humanoids. He tells them that, upon his and fellow ''Prometheus'' survivor [[List of Alien characters#Elizabeth Shaw|Elizabeth Shaw's]] arrival at the planet, their ship accidentally released a pathogen, which annihilated all [[fauna]] on the planet and Shaw perished when the ship crashed. Meanwhile, attempts to radio the ''Covenant'' are stymied by [[ion]] storms. When the remaining neomorph infiltrates the temple and kills crewmember Rosenthal, David tries to communicate with the creature, becoming incensed when Oram shoots it dead. Oram questions David, who reveals the aliens are a result of his releasing and experimenting with the pathogen to produce new lifeforms, before tricking Oram into being attacked by a [[Alien (creature in Alien franchise)#Facehugger|facehugger]]. A new form of creature, the protomorph, later erupts from Oram's chest, killing him.\n\nAs the others search for Oram and Rosenthal, Walter finds Shaw's [[dissection|dissected]] corpse, used by David as material for his evolving creature designs. David states that humanity is a dying and unworthy species, and his designed creature is a \"perfect organism\" that will eradicate them. When Walter disagrees, David disables him and then threatens Daniels. Walter heals himself and engages David, allowing Daniels to escape.\n\nElsewhere, another [[Alien (creature in Alien franchise)|facehugger]] attacks security chief Dan Lope. Crewmember Cole quickly cuts it off, leaving Lope with acid burns on his face. The now fully grown protomorph kills Cole, while Lope escapes and meets up with Daniels. Tennessee arrives in a lander to extract Daniels, Lope, and Walter, who says David has \"expired\". They kill the attacking protomorph and return to the ''Covenant''.\n\nThe next morning, Daniels and Tennessee discover another protomorph has burst from Lope's chest, killing him, and is loose on the ''Covenant''. It matures and kills married crewmembers Ricks and Upworth. Daniels and Tennessee lure the creature into ''Covenant''{{'}}s [[terraforming]] bay and eject it into space.\n\n''Covenant'' resumes its voyage to Origae-6. As Walter puts Daniels in stasis, she realizes he is David but is unable to escape from her pod before falling asleep. David regurgitates two facehugger embryos, which he places in cold storage with the human embryos, and inspects the colonists. Posing as Walter, he sends a transmission in which he says all crewmembers except Daniels and Tennessee were killed by the earlier solar-flare incident.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{see also|List of Alien (film series) characters}}\n[[File:Katherine Waterston (28612937635) (cropped).jpg|thumb|Lead actress [[Katherine Waterston]]]] \n* [[Michael Fassbender]] as [[David 8]] and [[Walter One]],<ref name=\"BFI\"/> two synthetic androids.

Here, there's some doubt about David's ultimate motives, which puts ''Alien: Covenant'' squarely in the tradition of the ''[[Terminator (franchise)|Terminator]]'' and ''[[The Matrix (franchise)|Matrix]]'' movies. And, of course, the novel ''[[Frankenstein]]'', which carried the subtitle ''The Modern Prometheus''. No less than [[Stephen Hawking]]\u2014who survived with the aid of machines\u2014has predicted that we have 100 years to live before evolved machines take human imperfection as [[Existential risk from artificial general intelligence|justification for destroying humanity]]\".<ref>{{cite web|last1=Edelstein|first1=David|title=Review: Alien: Covenant Is an Origin Story We Might Not Have Wanted|url=http://www.vulture.com/2017/05/alien-covenant-movie-review.html|website=[[New York (magazine)#Digital expansion and blogs|Vulture]]|publisher=[[New York (magazine)|New York Media LLC]]|access-date=May 26, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211127194257/https://www.vulture.com/2017/05/alien-covenant-movie-review.html|archive-date=November 27, 2021|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nKevin Lincoln, writing for ''[[Vulture (website)|Vulture]]'', gave a strong endorsement of the depiction of David as an arch-villain in the film stating, \"...{{nbsp}}one franchise is showing it's still possible for a modern blockbuster to have a great villain.
