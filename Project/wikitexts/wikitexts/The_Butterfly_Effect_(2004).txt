Mackye Gruber]]. It stars [[Ashton Kutcher]], [[Amy Smart]], [[Eric Stoltz]], [[William Lee Scott]], [[Elden Henson]], [[Logan Lerman]], [[Ethan Suplee]], and [[Melora Walters]]. The title refers to the [[butterfly effect]].\n\nKutcher plays 20-year-old college student Evan Treborn,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imsdb.com/scripts/Butterfly-Effect,-The.html |last1=Gruber|first1=J. Mackye |last2= Bress |first2= Eric |title= ''The Butterfly Effect'': Shooting Draft |publisher= Internet Movie Script Database |access-date=Aug 12, 2017}}</ref> who experiences blackouts and memory loss throughout his childhood. Later, in his 20s, Evan finds he can travel back in time to inhabit his former self during those periods of blackout, with his adult mind inhabiting his younger body. He attempts to change the present by changing his past behaviors and set things right for himself and his friends, but there are [[unintended consequences]] for all. The film draws heavily on flashbacks of the characters' lives at ages 7 and 13 and presents several alternative present-day outcomes as Evan attempts to change the past, before settling on a final outcome.\n\nThe film had a poor critical reception;<ref name=rotten /><ref name=metacritic /><ref name=bradshaw/> however, it was a commercial success, generating box-office revenues of $96 million on a budget of $13 million. The film won the Pegasus Audience Award at the [[Brussels International Fantastic Film Festival]], and was nominated for Best Science Fiction Film at the [[Saturn Awards]] and Choice Movie: Thriller in the [[Teen Choice Awards]], but lost to ''[[Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind]]'' and ''[[The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (2003 film)|The Texas Chainsaw Massacre]]'', another film from [[New Line Cinema]], respectively.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Please review [[WP:FILMPLOT]] before adding material. -->\n\nGrowing up, Evan Treborn and his friends, Lenny Kagan and Kayleigh Miller, and Kayleigh's brother Tommy, suffered many severe [[psychological trauma]]s that frequently caused Evan to experience [[amnesia]]. These traumas include being forced to take part in [[child pornography]] by Kayleigh and Tommy's father, George Miller; being nearly strangled to death by his institutionalized father, Jason Treborn, who is then killed in front of him by guards; accidentally killing a mother and her infant daughter while playing with [[dynamite]] with his friends; and seeing his dog, Crockett, burned alive by Tommy.\n\nSome time later, while entertaining a girl in his college dorm room, Evan discovers that when he reads from his adolescent journals, he can time travel and redo parts of his past. His time-traveling episodes account for the frequent blackouts he experienced as a child since those are the moments that his adult self occupied his consciousness, such as the moment his father strangled him when he realized that Evan shared his time-traveling affliction. However, there are consequences to his revised choices that dramatically alter his present life. For example, his time-line leads to alternative futures in which he finds himself, variously, as a college student in a [[fraternity]], an inmate imprisoned for murdering Tommy, and a double [[amputee]]. Eventually, he realizes that, even though his intentions to fix the past are good, his actions have unforeseen consequences, in which either he or at least one of his friends suffers horribly. Moreover, the assimilation of dozens of years' worth of new memories from the alternative timelines causes him progressively worsening brain damage and nosebleeds.\n\nIn his fourth time travel, after accidentally killing Kayleigh while revisiting their childhood, he wakes up in a mental hospital and finds that the journals do not exist in this new reality.\nAt one point, Evan has a conversation with a doctor who reveals that his father had the same abilities before losing the photographs (in the new reality) that allowed him to time jump, causing everyone to believe him to be crazy. Evan ultimately reaches the conclusion that he and his friends will never have good futures as long as he keeps altering the past. \n\nAfter escaping the hospital staff and barricading himself in an office, Evan travels back one final time, via the use of an old home-movie, to the day he first met Kayleigh as a child. He intentionally upsets her so that she and Tommy will choose to live with their mother in a different neighborhood, instead of with their father when they divorce. As a result, they are not subjected to a destructive upbringing, do not grow up with Evan, and go on to have happy, successful lives. Evan awakens in a college dorm room, where Lenny is his roommate. As a test, he asks where Kayleigh is, to which Lenny responds \"Who's Kayleigh?\" Satisfied that his friends' futures are secure, Evan burns his journals and videos to avoid altering the timeline ever again.\n\nEight years later in [[New York City]], Evan exits an office building and passes Kayleigh on the street. Despite a brief look towards each other, they both keep walking.\n<!-- Please review [[WP:FILMPLOT]] before adding material. -->\n\n==Director's cut==\nThe [[director's cut]] features a different ending.\n\nWith his brain terribly damaged and aware that he is committed to a psychiatric facility where he will lose access to his time travel ability, Evan makes a desperate attempt to change the timeline by watching a family video, which shows his mother just before she was about to give birth to Evan. Evan travels back to that moment and strangles himself in the womb with his [[umbilical cord]] so as to prevent the multi-[[generational curse]] from continuing, consistent with an added scene where a psychic palm reader tells Evan \"you have no lifeline\" and that he does \"not belong to this world\".\n\nKayleigh is then seen as a child in the new timeline having chosen to live with her mother instead of her father, and a montage suggests that the lives of the other childhood characters have become loving and less tragic.\n\n==Cast==\n<!-- Cast and order per closing tombstone credits, roles per closing credits scroll -->\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Ashton Kutcher]] as Evan\n** [[Logan Lerman]] as Evan at 7\n** [[John Patrick Amedori]] as Evan at 13\n* [[Amy Smart]] as Kayleigh\n** [[Irene Gorovaia]] as Kayleigh at 13\n* [[Eric Stoltz]] as Mr. Miller\n* [[William Lee Scott]] as Tommy\n** [[Jesse James (actor)|Jesse James]] as Tommy at 14\n* [[Elden Henson]] as Lenny\n** [[Kevin Schmidt|Kevin G.
