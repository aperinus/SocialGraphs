The film stars [[Lon Chaney Jr.]] in the title role. [[Claude Rains]], [[Warren William]], [[Ralph Bellamy]], [[Patric Knowles]], [[Bela Lugosi]], [[Evelyn Ankers]], and [[Maria Ouspenskaya]] star in supporting roles. The title character has had a great deal of influence on [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]]'s depictions of the legend of the [[werewolf]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.dvdmg.com/wolfman.shtml|title=The Wolf Man: Classic Monster Collection (1941)|website=www.dvdmg.com|access-date=2008-02-18|archive-date=2011-10-09|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111009165611/http://dvdmg.com/wolfman.shtml|url-status=live}}</ref> The film is the second [[Universal Pictures]] werewolf film, preceded six years earlier by the less commercially successful ''[[Werewolf of London]]'' (1935). This film is part of the [[Universal Monsters]] movies and is of great cinematic acclaim for its production.\n\nAfter this movie's success, Lon Chaney Jr. would reprise his role as \"The Wolf Man\" in four sequels, beginning with ''[[Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man]]'' in 1943.\n\n==Plot==\n[[Larry Talbot]] returns to his ancestral home in [[Llan place name element|Llanwelly]], [[Wales]] to bury his recently deceased brother and reconcile with his estranged father, Sir John Talbot. Larry falls in love with a local girl named Gwen Conliffe who runs an antique shop. As an excuse to talk to her, he purchases a [[walking stick (device)|walking stick]] decorated with a silver wolf's head. Gwen tells him that it represents a [[werewolf]], a man who changes into a wolf \"at certain times of the year\". The werewolf always sees a [[pentagram]] on the palm of his next victim. Various villagers recite a poem whenever werewolves are mentioned:\n\n:Even a man who is pure in heart, and says his prayers by night;\n:May become a wolf when the [[Aconitum|wolfsbane]] blooms and the autumn moon is bright.\n\nThough Gwen firmly refuses Larry's persistent proposals for a date, they meet that night at the proposed time, and are joined by Gwen's friend Jenny to go have their [[Fortune-telling|fortunes told]]. The [[Romani people|Romani]] fortuneteller, Bela, sees a pentagram when he examines Jenny's palm, and frantically sends her away. While awaiting their turns, Larry and Gwen take a walk. Gwen informs Larry that she is engaged. They hear Jenny scream. Larry attempts to rescue Jenny, who is being attacked by a wolf. He kills the wolf with his new walking stick but is bitten on the chest. Police investigating the scene find Jenny's throat torn out and Bela battered to death, with Larry's walking stick clearly the murder weapon in the latter case. Suspicion on Larry deepens when he cannot substantiate his story of fighting a wolf, since his chest wound miraculously healed overnight. The fact that Larry and Gwen were not with Jenny when she was attacked additionally raises suspicions of adultery. Though Gwen's fiance Frank believes in their innocence, Larry and Gwen become local pariahs.\n\nBela's mother, Maleva, reveals to Larry that the wolf which bit him was Bela in the form of a wolf, and Larry is now a werewolf too because he was bitten by one. Silver is the only thing that can kill a werewolf. Maleva gives him a charm to prevent the transformation. Uncertain whether to believe her, he instead gives the charm to Gwen for protection.\n\nLike Maleva warned, Larry transforms into a [[Humanoid|humanoid]] wolf [[Human-animal hybrid|hybrid]] on the following night and kills a villager. He returns to normal the next morning with no memory of his rampage. Authorities believe the killing to be the work of a wolf; they set traps and send out hunting parties. The next night, Larry turns into a werewolf and is caught in one of the traps. Maleva uses a spell to temporarily change him back to human form, allowing him to free himself before a hunting party finds him.\n\nNow convinced he is a werewolf, a distraught Larry decides to leave town. When he says his goodbye to Gwen, he sees a pentagram on her palm. He tells his father he is a werewolf and killed Bela and the villager, but his father thinks Larry is delusional and ties him to a chair to prevent him from leaving and prove to him he is not a werewolf. When the moon rises Larry transforms again, breaks free of his restraints, and attacks Gwen. Not recognizing the werewolf as his son, Sir John bludgeons him over the head with Larry's silver-headed cane which Larry gave him. Maleva arrives and again uses the spell. Sir John and Gwen watch in horror as the dead werewolf transforms into Larry's human corpse.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:TheWolfManLobbyCardCropped.png|thumb|267px|Promotional image featuring [[Evelyn Ankers]] and [[Lon Chaney Jr]].]]\n{{Cast list |\n* [[Lon Chaney Jr.]] as [[Larry Talbot|Lawrence \"Larry\" Talbot / The Wolf Man]]\n* [[Claude Rains]] as Sir John Talbot\n* [[Warren William]] as Dr. Lloyd\n* [[Ralph Bellamy]] as Colonel Paul Montford\n* [[Patric Knowles]] as Frank Andrews\n* [[Bela Lugosi]] as Bela, the Romani fortune teller and werewolf\n* [[Maria Ouspenskaya]] as Maleva, the gypsy sorceress\n* [[Evelyn Ankers]] as Gwen Conliffe\n* [[J.

The lap-dissolve progressive makeups were seen only in the final ten minutes and were presented discreetly. In the first transformation, Larry removes his shoes and socks. His feet are seen to grow hairy and become huge paws (courtesy of uncomfortable \"boots\" made of hard rubber, covered in yak hair). In the final scene, the werewolf gradually returns to Larry Talbot's human form through the standard technique.\n\n=== FX makeup ===\nStories about the makeup and transformation scenes have become legendary and are mostly apocryphal. The transformation of Chaney from man into a monster was certainly laborious; the entirety of the makeup took five to six hours to apply and an hour to remove.<ref>Vieira, p. 97</ref>  [[Jack Pierce (makeup artist)|Jack Pierce]] had initially designed it for [[Henry Hull]] in ''[[Werewolf of London]]'' (1935), but Hull argued that the disguise made no sense within the plot since \"Dr. Glendon\" needed to be recognizable by the characters even in his werewolf form. Pierce was ordered to design a second version which left more of Hull's face recognizable. Pierce then recycled his original design for the 1941 film.\n\nChaney claimed he was forced to sit motionless for hours as the scenes were shot frame by frame. At times he claimed he was left to remain sitting while the crew broke for lunch and was also equivocal about using the bathroom. Chaney even said special effects men drove tiny finishing nails into the skin on the sides of his hands so they would remain motionless during close-ups. However, there may be some exaggeration involved - studio logs indicate that during the filming of ''[[Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein]]'' (1948), the entire crew, including Chaney, took a two-hour break during the filming of a transformation and filmed the rest of the scene later that day (though the makeup for ''Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein'' had significantly been redesigned and streamlined by [[Bud Westmore]] over the original Jack Pierce makeup). What happened was a plaster mold was made to hold his head still as his image was photographed and his outline drawn on panes of glass in front of the camera. Chaney then went to makeup man Jack Pierce's department, where Pierce, using grease paint, a rubber snout appliance, and a series of wigs, glued layers of yak hair to Chaney's face. Then Chaney would return to the set, line himself up using the panes of glass as a reference, and several feet of film was shot. Then Chaney would return to the makeup department. A new layer would be applied to show the transformation being further along. He would then return to the sound stage to film. This was done about a half-dozen times. Talbot's [[lap dissolve]] transformation on screen only took seconds, while Chaney's took almost ten hours.\n\n==Reception==\n{{expand section|date=July 2018}}\nOn the [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film holds an approval rating of 90% based on {{nowrap|42 reviews}}, with an average rating of 7.8/10.

In the 1970s, novelizations of the original films were issued as paperback originals as part of a series written by \"Carl Dreadstone\", a  [[Pen name|pseudonym]] for British horror writer [[Ramsey Campbell]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Wolfman|last=Dreastone|first=Carl|publisher=Berkley Publishing Group|year=1977|isbn=978-0425034460|location=New York, NY}}</ref>\n\n===Sequels===\n''The Wolf Man'' proved popular, so Chaney reprised his signature role in four more Universal films. However, unlike his contemporary \"monsters\", Larry Talbot never had a sequel all to himself. ''[[Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man]]'' (1943) had Talbot's grave opened on a full moon night, causing him to rise again (making him, in the subsequent films, technically one of the [[undead]]). The full moon, which had not been shown or mentioned in the first film, was used as a quasi-explanation for the monster's resurrection, and the poem known to the local villagers was [[Retroactive continuity|retconned]] to mention the full moon so that the last line became and the moon is full and bright.\n\nThe resurrected Talbot seeks out Dr. Frankenstein for a cure but finds the monster ([[Bela Lugosi]]) instead. The two square off at the climax, but the fight ends in a draw when a dam is exploded, and Frankenstein's castle is flooded. In 1944 Universal wanted to pair Dracula and the Wolf Man in \"The Wolf Man vs. Dracula\", but it was canceled in favor of [[Phantom of the Opera (1943 film)|a remake of ''Phantom of the Opera'']].{{Citation needed|date=October 2022}} In ''[[House of Frankenstein (1944 film)|House of Frankenstein]]'' (1944), Talbot is once again resurrected and is promised a cure via a brain transplant but is shot dead with a silver bullet instead. He returns with no explanation in ''[[House of Dracula]]'' (1945). He is finally cured of his condition, but he is afflicted once again, in the [[comedy film]] ''[[Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein]]'' (1948). This time the Wolf Man is a hero of sorts, saving Wilbur Grey ([[Lou Costello]]) from having his brain transplanted by Dracula (Bela Lugosi) into the head of the Monster ([[Glenn Strange]]). Grabbing the vampire as he turns into a bat, the Wolf Man dives over a balcony into the sea, taking Dracula with him.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://bloody-disgusting.com/news/18912/a-look-back-at-a-hairy-franchise-the-transformation-of-the-wolf-man-films/|title=A Look Back at a Hairy Franchise: The Transformation of 'The Wolf Man' Films|first=Chris|last=Eggertsen|date=February 1, 2010|access-date=October 8, 2020|archive-date=October 11, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201011023233/https://bloody-disgusting.com/news/18912/a-look-back-at-a-hairy-franchise-the-transformation-of-the-wolf-man-films/|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Remake===\n{{Main|The Wolfman (2010 film)}}\n[[Universal Studios|Universal Pictures]] produced a [[The Wolfman (2010 film)|remake]] of ''The Wolf Man'' with [[Joe Johnston]] directing the film and [[Benicio del Toro]] starring as Lawrence Talbot (also producer of the film).  The [[remake]] followed the same basic plot as the original. However, the story and characters were significantly altered, with [[Anthony Hopkins]] in a radically altered version of the [[Claude Rains]] role. The film was released on February 12, 2010, and opened at No. 2 at the box office that weekend. The film was met with mixed reviews and a low box office reception but won an [[Academy Award for Best Makeup]] in 2011.\n\nDue to the 2010 remake performing below expectations at the box office, Universal chose not to produce a sequel.
