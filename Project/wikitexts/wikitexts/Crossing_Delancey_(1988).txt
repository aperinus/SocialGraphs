When author Anton Maes comes to the bookstore to give a reading, he shows an interest in Isabelle, who is enamored with the intellectual world that is very different from her traditional Jewish upbringing.\n\nIsabelle pays frequent visits to her ''Bubbe'' (grandmother), Ida, who lives on the Lower East Side of Manhattan. Anxious for her granddaughter to settle down, Ida turns to the local marriage broker. Although shocked and annoyed, Isabelle allows the matchmaker to introduce her in Bubbe\u2019s kitchen to Sam Posner, who owns the nearby pickle shop.\n\nAt first Isabelle is not interested in Sam, believing that he is too working-class for her. Instead, she sets her sights on Anton and the New York intelligentsia. But she also feels guilty for how rude she was to Sam, so she tries to make it up to him by setting him up with her girlfriend Marilyn. In the process, she learns that he did not hire a matchmaker out of desperation and in fact has admired Isabelle from afar for several years. She is deeply touched and begins to like him, but it seems Sam has given up on her and starts dating Marilyn.\n\nOne day at a store book reading, Sam shows up, as does Anton. Isabelle leaves with Sam, and later agrees to meet him the next day at her Bubbe\u2019s apartment.\n\nAfter work the next day, however, she is sidelined by Anton and, believing that he is romantically interested in her, goes to his apartment. She discovers instead that Anton wants the convenience of an assistant, not a true partner. Finally seeing through him, the disgusted Isabelle races to her grandmother's apartment late, finding it empty with Ida sleeping on the couch. Heartbroken, she believes she has ruined her chances with the honest and caring Sam. As she cries, Sam enters from the balcony. The two finally are united and Ida feigns confusion, but is gleeful that her plan has succeeded.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n*Isabelle Grossman - [[Amy Irving]]\n*Sam Posner - [[Peter Riegert]]\n*Bubbe (Ida) Kantor - [[Reizl Bozyk]]\n*Anton Maes - [[Jeroen Krabb\u00e9]]\n*Hannah Mandelbaum - [[Sylvia Miles]]\n*Lionel - [[George Martin (American actor)|George Martin]]\n*Nick - [[John Bedford Lloyd]]\n*Cecelia Monk - Claudia Silver\n*Mark - [[David Hyde Pierce]] (billed as David Pierce)\n*Pauline Swift - [[Rosemary Harris]]\n*Marilyn Cohen - [[Suzzy Roche]]\n*Ricki - [[Amy Wright]]\n*Candyce - [[Faye Grant]]\n*Karen - [[Deborah Offner]]\n*Myla Bondy - [[Kathleen Wilhoite]]\n*Rabbi - Moishe Rosenfeld\n*Diva - Paula Laurence\n*Woman in cab - Christine Campbell\n*Cab driver - [[Reg E.
