Based on [[Toni Morrison]]'s 1987 [[Beloved (novel)|novel of the same name]], the plot centers on a former enslaved person after the [[American Civil War]], her haunting by a [[poltergeist]], and the visitation of her [[reincarnation|reincarnated]] daughter.\n\nDespite being a [[Box-office bomb|box office bomb]],<ref name=\"moviefone\" /> ''Beloved'' received an [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Costume Design|Best Costume Design]] for [[Colleen Atwood]], the film received mostly positive reviews, and both Danny Glover and [[Kimberly Elise]] received praise for their performances.\n\n==Plot==\nSethe is a former [[slave]] living on the outskirts of [[Cincinnati, Ohio]] shortly after the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]. An angry [[poltergeist]] residing in the family home terrorizes Sethe and her three children, an act which causes two of them to run away forever.\n\nEight years later, Sethe lives alone with her daughter, Denver. Paul D., an old friend from Sweet Home, the [[plantations in the American South|plantation]] Sethe had escaped from years earlier, finds Sethe's home, where he drives off the angry spirit that inhabits it. Afterwards, Paul D. proposes that he should stay and Sethe responds favorably. Shortly after Paul D. moves in, a clean young woman who appears to have a cognitive delay named Beloved finds her way into Sethe's yard and is taken in by her.\n\nDenver is initially happy to have Beloved around, but learns that she is Sethe's [[reincarnation|reincarnated]] daughter. Nonetheless, she chooses not to divulge Beloved's origins to Sethe. One night, Beloved, aware that Paul D. dislikes her, immobilizes him with a spell and rapes him. Paul D. resolves to tell Sethe what happened, but instead asks her to have a baby with him. When Stamp Paid, a co-worker of Paul D who has known Sethe for many years, learns of Paul D.'s plans for a family with Sethe, he pulls a newspaper clipping featuring Sethe and tells her story to the illiterate Paul D.\n\nYears ago, Sethe was raped by the nephews of Schoolteacher, the owner of Sweet Home. She complained to Mrs. Garner, Schoolteacher's sister-in-law, who confronted him. In retaliation, Schoolteacher and his nephews brutally whipped Sethe, leaving a \"tree\" of keloid scars on her back. Heavily pregnant with her fourth child, Sethe planned to escape. Her other children were sent off earlier to live with Baby Suggs, Sethe's mother-in-law, but Sethe stayed behind to look for her husband, Halle. Sethe was assaulted while searching for him in the barn. The Schoolteacher's nephews held her down, raped her, and forcibly took her breast milk.\n\nWhen Halle failed to appear, Sethe ran off alone. She crossed paths with Amy Denver, a white girl who treated Sethe's injuries and delivered Sethe's child, whom Sethe named Denver after Amy. Sethe eventually reached Baby Suggs' home, but her initial happiness was short-lived when Schoolteacher came to claim Sethe and her children. In desperation, Sethe slit her older daughter's throat, and attempted to kill her other children. Stamp Paid managed to stop her and the disgusted Schoolteacher departed. Sethe is detained for an unknown amount of time, and it is later revealed to Denver that she was saved from being hanged by an intervention from the Bodwins, a prominent Cincinnati family who knew Baby Suggs.\n\nPaul D., horrified by the revelation and suddenly understanding the origin of the poltergeist, confronts Sethe. Sethe justifies her decision without apology, claiming that her children would be better off dead than enslaved. Paul D. departs shortly thereafter in protest. After Paul D.'s departure, Sethe realizes that Beloved is the reincarnation of her dead daughter. Feeling elated yet guilty, Sethe spoils Beloved with elaborate gifts while neglecting Denver. Beloved soon throws a destructive tantrum and her malevolent presence causes living conditions in the house to deteriorate. The women live in squalor and Sethe is unable to work, having become physically and mentally drained by Beloved's parasitic nature. Denver becomes depressed yet, being inspired by a memory of her grandmother's confidence in her, she eventually musters the courage to leave the house and seek employment.\n\nAfter Denver finds employment with the Bodwins, women from the local church visit Sethe's house at the request of her new co-worker to perform an [[exorcism]]. Their motive for doing so is partly tempered with guilt; years before, they failed to warn Sethe of Schoolteacher's impending arrival. The women from the church comfort the family, and they are praying and singing loudly when Denver's new employer arrives to pick her up for work. Sethe sees him and, reminded of Schoolteacher's arrival, tries to attack him with an icepick, but is subdued by Denver and the women. During the commotion, Beloved disappears completely and Sethe, freed from Beloved's grip, becomes permanently bedridden.\n\nSome months later, Paul D. encounters Denver at the marketplace. He notices she has transformed into a confident and mature young woman. When Paul D. later arrives at Sethe's house, he finds her suffering from a deep malaise. He assures Sethe that he and Denver will now take care of her. Sethe tells him that she doesn't see the point, as Beloved, her \"best thing\", is gone. Paul D. disagrees, telling Sethe that she herself is her own best thing.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast list|\n* [[Oprah Winfrey]] as Sethe\n* [[Danny Glover]] as Paul D.\n* [[Thandiwe Newton]] (credited as Thandie Newton) as Beloved\n* [[Kimberly Elise]] as Denver\n* [[Hill Harper]] as Halle\n* [[Beah Richards]] as Baby Suggs\n* [[Lisa Gay Hamilton]] as Younger Sethe\n* [[Jason Robards]] as Mr. Bodwin\n* [[Albert Hall (actor)|Albert Hall]] as Stamp Paid\n* [[Harry Northup]] as Sheriff\n* [[Tracey Walter]] as Slave Catcher\n* [[Jude Ciccolella]] as Schoolteacher\n* [[Wes Bentley]] as Schoolteacher's Nephew\n* [[Irma P.
