The introduction to the film is sung by comedy artist [[\"Weird Al\" Yankovic]], and it was the first film to be written by [[Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer]] who later went on to co-write ''[[Scary Movie]]'' and write and direct parody films such as ''[[Date Movie]]'', ''[[Disaster Movie]]'', and ''[[Meet the Spartans]]''. The film's title is a parody of ''[[Die Hard]]''. The film was directed by [[Rick Friedberg]] who produced with [[Doug Draizin]] and [[Jeffrey Konvitz]].\n\nThe film was released by [[Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures|Buena Vista Pictures]] under its [[Hollywood Pictures]] banner on May 24, 1996, receiving negative reviews from critics. While many praised Nielsen's acting and its humor, most found the script, story, and its direction disappointing. The film eventually grossed $26&nbsp;million against a production budget of $18&nbsp;million.\n\n== Plot ==\nSecret agent [[WD-40]] Dick Steele has his work cut out for him. Along with the mysterious and lovely Veronique Ukrinsky, Agent [[Pi|3.14]], he must rescue the kidnapped Barbara Dahl and stop the evil genius, a General named Rancor, from seizing control of the entire world.\n\nRancor was wounded in an earlier encounter and no longer has arms. However, he can \"arm\" himself by attaching robotic limbs with various weapons attached. Steele is approached by an old friend, agent Steven Bishop, who unsuccessfully tries to recruit him out of retirement. However, when a news report Steele is watching reveals that Bishop has been killed, Steele returns to the agency. Steele given his new assignment by The Director, who also is testing out a variety of elaborate disguises. At headquarters, Steele encounters an old agency nemesis, Norm Coleman, and flirts with the Director's adoring secretary, referred to as Miss Cheevus.\n\nOn the job, Steele is assisted by an agent named Kabul, who gives him rides in a never-ending variety of specially designed cars. They seek help from McLuckey, a blond child left [[Home Alone|home alone]], who is very good at fending off intruders. Steele resists the temptations of a dangerous woman he finds waiting for him in bed. But he does work very closely with Agent 3.14, whose father, Professor Ukrinsky is also being held captive by Rancor.\n\nEverything comes to an explosive conclusion at the General's remote fortress, where Steele rescues both Barbara Dahl and Miss Cheevus and launches a literally disarmed Rancor into outer space, saving mankind.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Leslie Nielsen]] as Dick Steele, WD-40\n* [[Nicollette Sheridan]] as Veronique Ukrinsky, Agent 3.14\n* [[Charles Durning]] as The Director\n* [[Marcia Gay Harden]] as Miss Cheevus\n* [[Barry Bostwick]] as Norm Coleman\n* [[John Ales]] as Kabul\n* [[Andy Griffith]] as General Rancor\n* [[Elya Baskin]] as Professor Ukrinsky\n* [[Mason Gamble]] as McCluckey\n* Carlos Lauchu as \"Slice\"\n* [[Stephanie Romanov]] as Victoria and Barbara Dahl\n* [[Joyce Brothers]] as Steele's Tag-Team Member\n* [[Ray Charles]] as Bus Driver\n* [[Hulk Hogan]] as Dick's Tag-Team Partner\n* [[Roger Clinton, Jr.|Roger Clinton]] as Agent Clinton\n* [[Robert Culp]] as Businessman\n* [[Fabio Lanzoni]] as Himself\n* [[Robert Guillaume]] as Steven Bishop\n* [[Pat Morita]] as Brian, The Waiter\n* [[Talisa Soto]] as Desiree More\n* [[Mr. T]] as Helicopter Pilot\n* [[Alex Trebek]] as Agency Tape Recorder (voice)\n* [[Taylor Negron]] as Painter\n* [[Clyde Kusatsu]] as Noggin\n* [[Curtis Armstrong]] as Pastry chef\n* Tina Arning as Dancer #1\n* William Barillaro as Blind Driver\n* [[Michael Berryman]] as The Man with the oxygen mask\n* [[Downtown Julie Brown]] as Cigarette Girl\n* [[Stephen Burrows (actor)|Stephen Burrows]] as Agent Burrows\n* Keith Campbell as Thug #2\n* [[Carl Ciarfalio]] as Thug #1\n* Brad Grunberg as Postal Worker\n* [[Wayne Cotter]] as Male Dancer\n* Rick Cramer as Heimlich, Rancor Terrorist\n* [[Eddie Deezen]] as Rancor Guard that gets spit on\n* Joey Dente as Goombah, Dead Wise Guy\n* Paul Eliopoulos as Agent #1\n* Andrew Christian English as Paratrooper\n* [[Johnny G]] as Agent #2\n* [[Loren Janes|Loren & Ginger Janes]] as Couple in elevator (reprising their identical role from [[True Lies]])\n* Michael Lee Gogin ([[Brad Garrett]], voice) as Short Rancor Guard\n* [[Bruce Gray]] as The President\n* [[Johnny Kassir|John Kassir]] as Rancor Guard at intercom\n* [[Sally Stevens]] as Vocal Conductor/ Singer\n* [[Thuy Trang]] as Hawaiian-Dressed Waitress\n* [[\"Weird Al\" Yankovic]] as Himself, in title sequence\n* Larry Walsh as Musician\n* [[Rawle D.

It is a parody of title sequences from the [[James Bond]] films designed by [[Maurice Binder]], specifically 1965's ''[[Thunderball (film)|Thunderball]]'', complete with multiple colored backgrounds, silhouetted figures, women dancing with guns, and \"wavy\" text. Additionally, an [[urban legend]] states that during the recording of the theme to ''Thunderball'', [[Tom Jones (singer)|Tom Jones]] held the song's final note long enough to pass out. Yankovic holds it so long that his head explodes. Originally, Yankovic had planned to loop the note to the required length, but in the studio, he discovered he was able to hold the note long enough that no looping was required.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://weirdal.com/archives/miscellaneous/ask-al/ |title=Ask Al |last=Yankovic |first=Weird Al |author-link=\"Weird Al\" Yankovic |website=\"Weird Al\" Yankovic |access-date=March 27, 2019 }}</ref> The sequence was later included on ''[[\"Weird Al\" Yankovic: The Ultimate Video Collection]]'', although, for legal reasons, all credits and titles had to be taken out, excluding that of the film and of Yankovic himself.\n\n== Release ==\n\n=== Box office ===\nThe film opened at #3 with $10,448,420 behind ''[[Mission: Impossible (film)|Mission: Impossible]]''{{'}}s opening weekend and ''[[Twister (1996 film)|Twister]]''{{'}}s third.

For movie-after-movie, Leslie Nielsen has milked this same personality, and it's starting to wear ''very'' thin. As affable as the actor is, there's just nothing left in this caricature. However, while ''Spy Hard'' might have worked better with, say, Roger Moore in the title role (his 007 was a parody towards the end, anyway), Nielsen's performance is only a small part of a massively-flawed production.

The story is too weak to work even as a clothesline for gags. ''Spy Hard'' eschews a coherent story and instead just strings together movie takeoffs. ... Nielsen, with his expert deadpan and sense of comic timing, creates the illusion of humor \u2013 for about 15 minutes.
