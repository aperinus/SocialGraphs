It is the third and final installment of the trilogy, following ''[[Garfield Gets Real]]'' and ''[[Garfield's Fun Fest]]''. It was released on [[DVD]] and [[Blu-ray Disc]] on June 16, 2009. It was written by Garfield creator Jim Davis. It was released theatrically in [[3D film|3-D]] in select countries such as Poland, Italy and Spain, and became the most profitable film in the trilogy. It is the last ''Garfield'' film to be distributed by [[20th Century Fox]] (who lost the film and television rights to ''Garfield'' franchise shortly after the film's release), ten years prior to [[Nickelodeon]]'s acquisition of [[Paws, Inc.]] in August 2019, as well as the upcoming animated ''[[Garfield (2024 film)|Garfield]]'' film which will be distributed by [[Sony Pictures]] and produced by [[Alcon Entertainment]], and was set to be released in 2024.{{Citation needed|date=January 2022}}\n\n==Summary==\n\nWhen Vetvix comes to Comic Strip World to go after Garzooka. Garzooka enlists Garfield, Nermal, Arlene, and Odie to help him stop Vetvix by becoming the Pet Force. However, Garfield would rather eat and sleep than help save the world and he saw this as too much work. When Vetvix starts threatening Garfield's world, Garfield realizes what's really at stake. Will Garfield stop being lazy and help the Pet Force, and save the world?\n\n==Plot==\nOn the planet Dorkon, Professor Wally (the professor counterpart to Wally) shows Emperor Jon (the emperor counterpart to [[Jon Arbuckle]]) his new invention, the Moscram ray gun, a device powered by the Klopman crystal that can scramble inanimate objects and organisms into new creatures under the user's control, but the Emperor is more concerned about finding a wife to continue the royal line. Soon a warship led by Vetvix (the super-villain counterpart to Liz) lands outside the palace and Emperor Jon instantly falls in love with her, asking if he can marry her. She agrees, but only because she wanted to steal the Moscram. She zombifies the Emperor's guards, forcing Professor Wally to summon the Pet Force: Garzooka ([[Garfield (character)|Garfield]]'s superhero counterpart), Odious ([[Odie]]'s superhero counterpart), Abnermal ([[List of Garfield characters#Nermal|Nermal]]'s superhero counterpart), and Starlena ([[List of Garfield characters#Arlene|Arlene]]'s superhero counterpart), to save them but Vetvix zombifies the Pet Force except Garzooka. Garzooka manages to get hold of the Klopman and escapes with the Professor in a secret passageway. The professor uses his computer to search the universe for counterparts with DNA matches with the Pet Force & when he does, he gives Garzooka their pictures and some serums that will transform them into the Pet Force, who then takes off to the Comic World leaving Professor Wally & Vetvix, who's vowing for revenge, behind.\n\nThe situation was revealed to be a comic book Nermal was reading during a cookout with Jon and the gang. Nermal is really excited about getting the next 100th edition issue. Garfield's friends go to the Comic studio to work their new strip without Garfield who wants to finish all the hot dogs. Nermal gets the new Pet Force issue from a news stand, with Garzooka jumping out of a comic book afterwards. Nermal finds that the events that are happening to them are in the comic book, and the rest of the book is blank because they have not happened yet. Garzooka heads for Jon's house, and is told where Odie, Arlene, and Nermal are by Garfield. Garzooka gives Garfield the Klopman as well, telling him to protect it.\n\nIn the living room at the Comic Studios, Nermal, Arlene, and Odie notice Garzooka behind them after Nermal reads the new comic book. Garzooka hands them the serums, asking them to help him stop Vetvix. But they don't change immediately after they drink the serums. However it's time for Odie, Arlene, and Nermal to go to work and Garzooka follows. Meanwhile, the real Garfield is enjoying a relaxing day all to himself, but is captured by Vetvix, who mistakes him for Garzooka(as his DNA is similar to Garzooka's) and threatens him for the Klopman, but to no avail (because Garfield is a cartoon character). Garfield tries to protect the Klopman by putting it in his mouth, but eventually Vetvix's guards get it. Garfield is told by Professor Wally to go over to Emperor Jon who then tells him to grab the Professor's lens and put it on the window. The sunlight loosens the Emperor and the professor's ropes while Vetvix orders her guards to get rid of Garfield, they then throw him down the garbage chute.\n  \nBack at Comic Studios, the gang is interrupted by Vetvix, who zombifies most of the characters at the studio. Nermal, Odie, Arlene, Jon, and Garzooka escape to the back alley and meet up with Garfield. Nermal, Odie, and Arlene's serum kick in and transform into their Pet Force counterparts. Garzooka and his team then go off to fight Vetvix, employee Eli saves Garfield by sucking him up an air vent, but Jon gets zombified with a nearby trash can. Vetvix causes chaos, zombifying all of Cartoon World, as the citizens of Comic World try to make a run for it but are unsuccessful. Eli scolds Garfield for not helping Garzooka and if he hadn't been so lazy then Vetvix wouldn't have gotten the Klopman. Eli and Garfield manage to find three survivors: Wally Stegman, his wife Bonita and assistant director Betty. Garfield names himself and the survivors \"The Crazy Crew\" and forms their own plan to help Garzooka's crew and to stop Vetvix. Meanwhile, the zombies break into the tower, making the Pet Force escape to the top. Garzooka realizes the zombies are too much for them as his allies start to feel weakened and outnumbered. Garfield and Wally pretend to be zombies, then disguise themselves as Garzooka and get the zombies attention, making them the zombies chase them to the Comic Studio, and Eli opens the pit in the filming area, in which the zombies fall into. The real Garzooka and the Pet Force head to the antenna and use it to bring down Vetvix's ship but Vetvix fires up the Moscram, using the super scramble mode, zombifing the Pet Force & creating a monster made from the town's buildings.\n\nEmperor Jon and Professor Wally break free, and take over the ship, flying into the air, making Vetvix fall off. Meanwhile, Vetvix's ship (with Professor Wally and Emperor Jon controlling it) lands near the back alley of Comic Studio, and the Crazy Crew meet Emperor Jon and Professor Wally, who let Garfield enter the ship. Garfield seizes control of the Moscram & dezombifies the residents, destroys the monster, combines Vetvix with the smile section, an invention that makes people happy, turning her into a good guy who then for the second time, accepts the emperor's proposal. The Pet force turn back into their original forms and Garzooka, Vetvix, the Professor (who vows to destroy the Moscram after reversing the damage on Dorkon) and the Emperor return to their world while the Comic World residents rebuild their civilization. A reformed Garfield and Arlene are then seen taking off to the stars.\n\nDuring the credits while watching Emperor Jon's wedding, the gang are watching but they see that Betty has moved to Dorkon. It looks like there will have to be a new assistant to director Charles, which Nermal is eager to take.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Frank Welker]] as Garfield / Garzooka / Narrator / Monster / Additional Voices\n* [[Gregg Berger]] as Odie / Odious\n* [[Audrey Wasilewski]] as Arlene / Starlena\n* [[Jason Marsden]] as Nermal / Abnermal\n* [[Vanessa Marshall]] as Vetvix\n* [[Wally Wingert]] as Jon Arbuckle / Emperor Jon\n* [[Fred Tatasciore]] as Billy Bear / Horned Guard\n* [[Greg Eagles]] as Eli\n* [[Jennifer Darling]] as Betty / Bonita Stegman\n* [[Stephen Stanton]] as Randy Rabbit / Additional Voices\n* [[Neil Ross]] as Wally / Charles / Professor Wally\n\n==Reception==\n\n=== Box office ===\nThe film opened in twenty countries.
