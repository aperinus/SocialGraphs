The film was released in the United States on September 5, 1997.\n\n==Plot==\nIn the peaceful [[Appalachia]]n hills of eastern [[Kentucky]], toxins are being dumped into abandoned mines, causing environmental havoc, but the locals, mindful of their jobs and the power of the mine owners, can do nothing. [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|EPA]] [[Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance|CID]] agent Jack Taggert is sent to investigate, after a fellow agent, revealed to be Jack\u2019s friend and partner, is found dead, probably not by accident. The EPA has received an anonymous letter from [[Jackson, Kentucky]], and Taggert goes there undercover to continue his colleague's investigations.\n\nIt is discovered that Hanner Coal Company, owned by Orin Hanner Sr., is being paid to dump toxic waste into an abandoned coal mine shaft, so Jack is assigned to go to the small town of Jackson, where his cover is that of assistant and volunteer carpenter to a local church. He stays in a room in the church's basement, and begins his cover work by repairing the roof at a house where one of the children is sick because of the pollution. He attempts to question the family, but they do not have much to say. He has little better results elsewhere; even the man who tipped off the EPA is decidedly taciturn. While testing the water, Taggert wanders into a local marijuana field, and is accosted by the growers. After disarming them, he tells them that he has no interest in arresting them.\n\nThe men responsible for the other agent's death soon notice Taggert's presence. As a newcomer to the small local community, he is threatened by Hanner's son Orin, Jr. ([[Brad Hunt (actor)|Brad Hunt]]), the incompetent local tool of the company, the corrupt local Sheriff Lloyd Foley, and several thugs that work for them. The thugs in question start by leaving two rattlesnakes in his dwelling; Taggert responds by capturing the snakes alive and leaving them in the pickup that the thugs were driving, causing them to crash. Soon after, five of them attack him while he is buying supplies, and receive a severe beating as a result. Orin then orders one of his truck drivers to arrange an \"accident\" by running him off the road, but Taggert escapes alive while the driver is killed after falling off an open-pit mine cliff.\n\nWhile these conflicts are occurring, Taggert strikes up a relationship with Sarah Kellogg, a young woman who lives in the town. She is regarded as an outcast because of her father's murder, a crime of which she was accused but not convicted. Eventually, she agrees to testify against Orin and his people, much to the anger of her estranged brother Earl, who actually committed the murder, after their father found out about his sexual abuse against her. Earl is revealed to be working as one of Hanner's thugs, and sets the church on fire, in the process killing the preacher who was helping Taggert. He then attempts to collapse the mine with Taggert inside it. Taggert escapes, while several mercenaries are killed, including Earl.\n\nWith evidence and a witness, Taggert calls the [[FBI]] to take Sarah into protective custody. However, they are revealed to be corrupt, and a firefight ensues. Taggert kills one agent, then sends the second back to Orin with a message that he'll be coming for him next. However, when Orin is arrested and charged, he gets off with a slap on the wrist for the environmental violations. Taggert goes back into the town and fights his way past the last of Orin Jr's thugs, then demands the truth from him. Orin agrees to turn state's evidence, implicating his father on [[Racket (crime)|racketeering]], conspiracy, and murder charges. Taggert goes to a casino to arrest Orin, Sr. Upon hearing about the reception awaiting him in federal prison, Orin produces a gun and resists, but Taggert shoots him in the shoulder and he is taken into custody. Taggert then returns to Jackson, where he is reunited with Sarah.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Steven Seagal]] as EPA Agent Jack Taggert\n* [[Marg Helgenberger]] as Sarah Kellogg\n* [[Harry Dean Stanton]] as Harry 'Cotton Harry'\n* [[John Diehl]] as EPA Agent Frank Elkins\n* [[Stephen Lang]] as Earl Kellogg\n* [[Brad Hunt (actor)|Brad Hunt]] as Orin Hanner Jr.\n* [[Levon Helm]] as Reverend Bob Goodall\n* [[Kris Kristofferson]] as Orin Hanner Sr.\n* [[Mark Collie]] as Hatch\n* Alex Harvey as Sims\n* [[Ed Bruce]] as Sheriff Lloyd Foley\n* Amelia Neighbors as Edie Carr\n* [[Richard Masur]] as Phil Pratt\n* [[Randy Travis]] as Ken Adams\n* [[Marty Stuart]] as Himself\n* [[Travis Tritt]] as Himself\n* [[Ernie Lively]] as Todd\n* James Mathers as Marshall Adams\n* [[Kane Hodder]] as Bodyguard\n* [[Peggy Lynn]] store clerk\n* [[Patsy Lynn]] store clerk\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\nThe film was shot on location in and around [[Kentucky]]; parts of the \"truck chase scene\" were shot at [[Natural Bridge State Resort Park]].
