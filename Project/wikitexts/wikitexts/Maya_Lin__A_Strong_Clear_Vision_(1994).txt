It explores the life of American artist [[Maya Lin]], whose best-known work is the [[Vietnam Veterans Memorial]] in [[Washington, D.C.]]<ref name=Ebertrev>{{cite web|first=Roger |last=Ebert |authorlink=Roger Ebert|url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/maya-lin-a-strong-clear-vision-1996 |title=Reviews: Maya Lin: A Strong Clear Vision |website=Roger Ebert.com |date=March 29, 1996 |accessdate=July 30, 2022}}</ref> The film won the 1994 [[Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature]]. While a number of movie critics objected to it receiving this award, ''Maya Lin: A Strong Clear Vision'' met with mostly positive reviews, garnering praise for its look at the controversy surrounding the Vietnam Veterans Memorial design and Lin's growth as an artist.\n\n==Reception==\n===Accolades===\nThe film won the 1994 [[Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature]].<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvXsfo_5l7U Documentary Winners: 1995 Oscars]</ref><ref name=\"Oscars1995\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/1995 |title=The 67th Academy Awards (1995) Nominees and Winners|accessdate=2015-05-12|work=Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences|publisher=AMPAS}}</ref> It later aired on the [[PBS]] series ''[[POV (TV series)|POV]]''.\n\nThe award was mired in controversy as acclaimed films such as ''[[Hoop Dreams]]'' failed to receive a nomination. Film critic [[Roger Ebert]] also suggested that the nomination of ''Maya Lin'' stemmed from [[cronyism]], since Mock was the chair of the committee which makes the nominations (though she stepped aside for the year that ''Maya Lin'' was under consideration), and was thus close friends with many of the committee members.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Brady Bunch Movie, Just Cause, Billy Madison, Mr. Payback, 1995 |url=https://siskelebert.org/?p=5504 |website=Siskel and Ebert Movie Reviews |accessdate=28 July 2019}} Event occurs at 18:15-19:07.</ref> Mock denied that the nomination in any way stemmed from cronyism and hired an attorney to respond to the press criticism.<ref name=onownSFG>{{cite web|first=Edward |last=Guthmann |url=https://www.sfgate.com/entertainment/article/Freida-Lee-Mock-s-Strong-Clear-Vision-Director-3020546.php |title=Freida Lee Mock's Strong Clear Vision / Director says `Lin' stands on its own |website=[[SFGate]] |accessdate=July 30, 2022}}</ref> Ebert and his associate [[Gene Siskel]] publicly apologized to Mock after seeing ''Maya Lin'', with Ebert saying \"I think it's a good film and deserved to be nominated.\", but other prominent critics such as [[Janet Maslin]] maintained that while ''Maya Lin'' was a good film it was clearly outshone by documentaries such as ''Hoop Dreams'' and ''[[Crumb (film)|Crumb]]'' which were passed up for nomination.<ref name=onownSFG/>\n\n===Reviews===\nRoger Ebert, despite his earlier outrage over ''Maya Lin: A Strong Clear Vision'' being nominated for an Academy Award, admitted in his review for the film that \"It was not the best documentary of the year, but it is a valuable document. If you have been to the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, you will want to see it. If you have not, it will make you want to go.\" He applauded the scenes showing Maya Lin's struggle against opponents of her design for the Vietnam Veterans Memorial as \"arresting\" and \"illuminating\", though he criticized the film for not exploring Lin's private life. He gave it three out of four stars.<ref name=Ebertrev/> Writing in ''[[The Austin Chronicle]]'', Alison Macor agreed with Ebert that the Academy Award controversy \"may have obscured what is a powerful, inspiring account of a supremely talented woman's professional transformation from a 20-year-old undergraduate architectural student at Yale to an accomplished and renowned architect and sculptor.\" Particularly praising Maya Lin's recount of her mixed feelings over winning the memorial design competition and the resulting controversy, and the way the film shows insight into Lin's design philosophy, she gave ''Maya Lin: A Strong Clear Vision'' three-and-a-half out of five stars.<ref>{{cite web |last=Macor |first=Alison |title=Maya Lin: A Strong Clear Vision |url=https://www.austinchronicle.com/events/film/1996-03-22/138248/ |website=[[The Austin Chronicle]] |access-date=30 July 2022 |date=March 22, 1996}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{IMDb title|id=0110480|title=Maya Lin: A Strong Clear Vision}}\n*[http://www.americanfilmfoundation.com/order/maya_lin.shtml ''Maya Lin: A Strong Clear Vision''] at the [[American Film Foundation]]\n*[http://www.pbs.org/pov/watch/mayalin/ ''Maya Lin: A Strong Clear Vision''] at ''[[POV (TV series)|POV]]''\n\n{{AcademyAwardBestDocumentaryFeature1981-2000}}\n\n[[Category:1994 films]]\n[[Category:American documentary films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Freida Lee Mock]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Charles Bernstein]]\n[[Category:Documentary films about Asian Americans]]\n[[Category:POV (TV series) films]]\n[[Category:Best Documentary Feature Academy Award winners]]\n[[Category:Vietnam Veterans Memorial]]\n[[Category:Documentary films about visual artists]]\n[[Category:Women and death]]\n[[Category:1990s English-language films]]\n[[Category:1990s American films]]"}]}}}}
