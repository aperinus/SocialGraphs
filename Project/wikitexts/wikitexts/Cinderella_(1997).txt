Freedman]]. Based on the French [[Cinderella|fairy tale]] by [[Charles Perrault]], the film is the second [[remake]] and third version of [[Rodgers and Hammerstein]]'s [[Rodgers and Hammerstein's Cinderella|musical]], which originally aired on television in 1957. Adapted from [[Oscar Hammerstein II]]'s [[Libretto|book]], Freedman modernized the script to appeal to more contemporary audiences by updating its themes, particularly re-writing its main character into a stronger heroine. Co-produced by [[Whitney Houston]], who also appears as Cinderella's [[Fairy Godmother]], the film stars [[Brandy Norwood|Brandy]] in the [[titular role]] and features a [[Cultural diversity|racially diverse]] cast consisting of [[Jason Alexander]], [[Whoopi Goldberg]], [[Bernadette Peters]], [[Veanne Cox]], [[Natalie Desselle]], [[Victor Garber]] and [[Paolo Montalb\u00e1n|Paolo Montalban]].\n\nFollowing the success of the [[Gypsy (1993 film)|1993 television adaptation]] of the stage musical ''[[Gypsy (musical)|Gypsy]]'' (1959), Houston approached ''Gypsy''<nowiki/>'s producers [[Craig Zadan]] and [[Neil Meron]] about starring in a remake of ''Rodgers & Hammerstein's Cinderella'' for [[CBS]]. However, development was delayed for several years, during which time the network grew disinterested in the project. By the time the film was [[Green-light|greenlit]] by Disney for [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], Houston felt that she had outgrown the title role, which she offered to Brandy instead. The decision to use a [[color-blind casting]] approach originated among the producers to reflect how society had evolved by the 1990s, with Brandy becoming the first Black actress to portray Cinderella on screen. Among the most significant changes made to the musical, several songs from other Rodgers and Hammerstein productions were [[Interpolation (classical music)|interpolated]] into the film to augment its score. With a production budget of $12 million, ''Rodgers & Hammerstein's Cinderella'' ranks among the most expensive television films ever made.\n\nHeavily promoted to re-launch the [[anthology series]] ''[[Wonderful World of Disney|The Wonderful World of Disney]]'', ''Rodgers & Hammerstein's Cinderella'' premiered on ABC on November 2, 1997 to mixed reviews from critics. While most reviewers praised the film's costumes, sets and supporting cast, particularly Peters, Alexander and Goldberg, [[television critics]] were divided over Brandy and Houston's performances, as well as Disney's more [[Feminism|feminist]] approach to Brandy's character. Despite this, ''Cinderella'' proved a major ratings success, originally airing to 60 million viewers and establishing itself as the most-watched television musical in decades, earning ABC its highest Sunday-night ratings in 10 years. ''Rodgers & Hammerstein's Cinderella'' was nominated for several industry awards, including seven [[Primetime Emmy Award]]s, winning one for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Variety Special (Pre-Recorded)|Outstanding Art Direction for a Variety or Music Program]]. The program's success inspired Disney and ABC to produce several similar musical projects.\n\nCritical reception towards the film has improved over time, with several media publications ranking it among the best film adaptations of the fairy tale. ''Rodgers & Hammerstein's Cinderella'' is regarded by contemporary critics as a groundbreaking film due to the unprecedented diversity of its cast and Brandy's role.\n\n== Plot ==\nCinderella grows distracted while waiting upon her stepmother and two stepsisters in the marketplace, where she meets a charming young man. Despite being apprehensive about introducing herself to him, the pair bond upon realizing that both are dissatisfied with their sheltered home lives. After being scolded for speaking to a stranger, Cinderella returns to her stepfamily's aid before she was able to realize the young man is Prince Christopher. The Prince returns to the palace, where he is apprehended by his valet Lionel for once again visiting the kingdom disguised as a commoner, and learns that his parents, Queen Constantina and King Maximillian, plan to host a ball in order to find their son a suitable bride, an idea he strongly protests because he would rather marry for love. At Lionel's suggestion, Constantina and Maximillian compromise that should Christopher not be successful in choosing a bride at the ball, he be allowed to find one on his own terms.\n\nBack at their own home, Cinderella wishes to attend the ball herself, but her stepmother ridicules the idea, advising her that a prince would never be interested in her and to remain grateful for her current life. Solely determined to bolster their own wealth and social status by marrying the prince, Cinderella's stepfamily leaves for the ball, leaving Cinderella home alone. Cinderella is soon visited by her Fairy Godmother for the first time, who encourages her to go to the ball; she magically transforms a pumpkin into a carriage, rats into footmen and a coachman, mice into horses, and her rags into a beautiful ballgown, complete with a pair of glass slippers. With her Fairy Godmother's warning that the spell will only last until midnight, Cinderella leaves for the ball.\n\nYet to be impressed with any of the young women he meets, including Cinderella's Stepsisters, Christopher is growing weary until Cinderella arrives, and the pair instantly start dancing much to the annoyance of Cinderella's stepfamily, who can't help but feel that the unidentified princess is familiar. Cinderella grows dismayed and wishes to leave when the King and Queen ask her about her background, but her Fairy Godmother encourages her to stay. The clock strikes midnight as Cinderella and the Prince share their first kiss, but Cinderella flees on foot while the spell is reverted, leaving behind a single glass slipper. With his parents' blessing, Christopher declares that he will marry whomever fits the slipper, even if it means trying it on every maiden in the kingdom.\n\nWhen Cinderella's stepfamily return home, they begin sharing embellished recounts of their evening. Cinderella explains that she can only imagine what it must have been like, and they briefly bond over the memory, only for the Stepmother to soon recognize Cinderella as the mysterious princess with whom the Prince danced and insisting that she will never be more than a common girl. With final encouragement from her Fairy Godmother, Cinderella finally decides she will run away from home.\n\nWhen the Prince and Lionel arrive at Cinderella's home, the Stepmother locks Cinderella in the kitchen hoping to keep her hidden. Cinderella's stepfamily \u2013 including the Stepmother \u2013 tries on the slipper with little success. Lionel demands that the kitchen be unlocked and searched, and the Prince discovers Cinderella in the courtyard about to run away. When Christopher recognizes Cinderella from the marketplace, he tries the slipper on her foot, and it fits perfectly. In the end, Cinderella and the Prince marry in a grand ceremony, while the palace gates close on her stepfamily, forcing them to watch from outside.\n\n== Cast ==\nOrder of credits adapted from ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' magazine and the [[British Film Institute]]:<ref name=\":49\">{{Cite web|url=https://variety.com/1997/film/reviews/rodgers-hammerstein-s-cinderella-2-1200451282/|title=Rodgers & Hammerstein's Cinderella|last=Richmond|first=Ray|date=October 26, 1997|website=Variety|access-date=August 2, 2018|quote=Whitney Houston (one of five executive producers)}}</ref><ref name=\":51\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b80b1a2dc|title=Rodgers & Hammerstein's Cinderella (1997)|website=BFI|quote=Alternative titles \u2013 Cinderella}}</ref>\n\n*[[Whitney Houston]] as [[Fairy Godmother]]\n*[[Brandy Norwood|Brandy]] as [[Cinderella]]\n*[[Jason Alexander]] as Lionel\n*[[Whoopi Goldberg]] as Queen Constantina<ref name=\":45\">{{Cite news|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PDsDAAAAMBAJ&q=%5BThe+Fairy+Godmother+is%5D+sassy%2C+honest+and+very+direct%2C+loving%2C+very+motherly%3B+she%E2%80%99s+comforting%2C%E2%80%9D&pg=PA44|title=Whitney Houston And Brandy Star In TV Movie 'Cinderella'|date=November 3, 1997|work=Jet|access-date=July 31, 2018|publisher=Johnson Publishing Company|pages=46\u201347|issn=0021-5996|via=Google Books}}</ref>\n*[[Bernadette Peters]] as [[Wicked stepmother|Stepmother]]\n*[[Veanne Cox]] as Calliope\n*[[Natalie Desselle]] as Minerva\n*[[Victor Garber]] as King Maximillian<ref name=\":45\" />\n*[[Paolo Montalb\u00e1n]] as [[Prince Charming|Prince Christopher]]\n\n==Musical numbers==\n*\"The Sweetest Sounds\" (from \"[[No Strings]]\" by Richard Rodgers)\n*\"The Prince Is Giving A Ball\"\n*\"In My Own Little Corner\"\n*\"Falling In Love With Love\" (from ''[[The Boys from Syracuse]]'' by Lorenz Hart)\n*\"Impossible - It's Possible\" \n*\"Ten Minutes Ago\"\n*\"Stepsister's Lament\"\n*\"Do I Love You Because You're Beautiful\"\n*\"A Lovely Night\"\n*\"There Is Music In You\"\n\n== Production ==\n=== Origins and development ===\n\n''Rodgers & Hammerstein's Cinderella'' was the third [[Screen adaptation|screen version]] of the musical.<ref name=\":17\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.broadwayworld.com/article/Brandy-Norwood-Bernadette-Peters-More-Look-Back-on-Twenty-Years-Since-CINDERELLA-20171102|title=Brandy Norwood, Bernadette Peters & More Look Back on Twenty Years Since Cinderella|date=November 2, 2017|website=Broadway World|access-date=July 16, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CsbEP_Mu50EC&q=falling+in+love+with+love+bernadette+peters&pg=PA81|title=The Rodgers and Hammerstein Encyclopedia|last=Hischak|first=Thomas S.|publisher=ABC-CLIO|year=2007|isbn=9780313341403|location=United States|via=Google Books}}</ref> Songwriters [[Richard Rodgers]] and [[Oscar Hammerstein II]] originally wrote ''Cinderella'' as a musical exclusively for television starring [[Julie Andrews]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.playbill.com/article/playbill-critics-circle-review-tv-cinderella-com-72021|title=Playbill Critics Circle: Review TV Cinderella|last=Viagas|first=Robert|date=November 7, 1997|website=Playbill|access-date=August 21, 2018}}</ref> which aired in 1957 to 107 million viewers.<ref name=\":42\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/theatre-dance/features/finally-cinderella-is-going-to-the-ball-78060.html|title=Finally, Cinderella is going to the ball|date=November 13, 2003|website=The Independent|access-date=July 30, 2018}}</ref> The telecast was remade in 1965 starring [[Lesley Ann Warren]],<ref name=\":8\" /><ref name=\":10\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.lamag.com/curtain-call-ted-chapin-makes-sure-cinderella-has-a-ball/|title=Curtain Call: Ted Chapin Makes Sure Cinderella Has a Ball|last=Byrd|first=Craig|date=March 25, 2015|website=Los Angeles|access-date=July 13, 2018}}</ref><ref name=\":12\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.playbill.com/article/playbill-on-opening-night-cinderella-the-very-best-foot-forward-com-203096|title=Playbill on Opening Night: Cinderella;

Freedman]] became involved with the project as early as 1993.<ref name=\":72\" /> Although he had not written a musical before, Freedman was fond of Warren's version and drawn to the opportunity to work with Zadan and Meron, whose plans to remake ''Cinderella'' he had first read about in a ''Variety'' article.<ref name=\":72\" /> Aware that the film could potentially be groundbreaking, Freedman, Zadan and Meron collaborated on several new ideas for the remake, among them ensuring that Cinderella \"was defined by more than falling in love\", providing her with her own [[story arc]] that is beyond simply finding a [[love interest]].<ref name=\":72\" /> The Rodgers & Hammerstein Organization allowed the filmmakers an unusual amount of freedom to modify the musical's script, among these changes making Cinderella a more active heroine;<ref name=\":26\">{{Cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1997/aug/24/entertainment/ca-25271|title=If the Slipper Fits . .

ultimately developing the character into a more independent woman.<ref name=\":72\" /> Instead of making each character more modern, Zadan opted to \"contemporize the qualities of the characters\" instead.<ref name=\"times\" /> Freedman was more concerned with writing a film suitable for young girls in the 1990s than writing a multi-cultural film, inspired by stories about his wife being affected by women's representation in films when she was growing up.<ref name=\":72\" /> In a conscious decision to update the fairy tale for a modern generation, Freedman sought to deconstruct the messages young girls and boys were subjected to in previous versions of the fairy tale, explaining, \"We didn't want the message to be 'just wait to be rescued\",<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite

children.\"<ref name=\":26\" /> Attempting to eliminate the element that Cinderella is simply waiting to be rescued by the prince, Freedman explained, \"I'm not saying that it's the most feminist movie you'll ever see, but it is compared the other versions.\"<ref name=\":72\" /> His efforts apply to both Cinderella and the prince; while Cinderella pines for independence from her [[stepfamily]] and actively disagrees with her stepmother's opinions about [[gender role]]s in marriage, the prince protests the idea of being married off to simply anyone his parents choose.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nFreedman continuously re-wrote the script between 1993 and 1997, particularly concerned about whether or not Houston would like his teleplay.<ref name=\":72\" /> Despite quickly earning approval from the Rodgers & Hammerstein Organization,<ref name=\":13\" /> Houston typically took longer to make decisions, and although the producers sent and continuously reminded her about the script, it remained unread for several months.<ref name=\":72\" /> Since Houston was still slated to play Cinderella at the time, production was unable to proceed without her involvement.<ref name=\":72\" /> In a final attempt to earn Houston's approval, Meron and Zadan enlisted Broadway actors to perform a [[read-through]] for the singer, namely [[LaChanze|La Chanze]] as Cinderella, [[Brian Stokes Mitchell]] as the prince, [[Theresa Merritt|Theresa Meritt]] as the Fairy Godmother and [[Dana Ivey]] as the Stepmother.<ref name=\":72\" /><ref name=\":35\" /> They hosted the table-read at the Rihga Royal Hotel in New York City, one of Houston's favorite locations at the time.<ref name=\":72\" /> Houston arrived at the reading several hours late, by which time some of the actors had grown frustrated and weary.<ref name=\":72\" /> Houston remained silent for most of the reading, barely engaging with the participants until the end of the table read when she finally declared her approval of the script and eventually sent the actors flowers to apologize for her tardiness.<ref name=\":72\" /> Houston believed strongly in the story's positive moral \"that nothing is impossible and dreams do come true,\" encouraging the filmmakers to imbue their version of ''Cinderella'' \"with a 90s sensibility but to remain faithful to the spirit of the original.\"<ref name=\":29\" /> Freedman identified Houston's eventual re-casting as the Fairy Godmother as a moment that instigated \"the next round of rewriting\",<ref name=\":72\" /> adapting her version of the character into a \"worldly-wise older sister\" to Cinderella, as opposed to the \"regal [[maternal figure]]\" that had been depicted prior.<ref name=\"times\" /> Houston described her character as \"sassy, honest and very direct ... all the things that you'd like a godmother to be.\"<ref name=\":45\" /> Houston found the most impressive part of the remake to be \"the lessons youngsters can learn about dreams and [[self-image]]\".<ref name=\":45\" />\n\nAccording to Ray Richmond of ''Variety'', Freedman's teleplay is faster in pace and contains more dialogue than previous versions,<ref name=\":49\" /> although ''A Problem Like Maria: Gender and Sexuality in the American Musical'' author Stacy Ellen Wolf believes that the teleplay borrows more from the 1957 version than Joseph Schrank's 1965 version due to sharing much of its humor, dialogue and [[gender politics]] with Hammerstein's book.<ref name=\":70\">{{Cite

remake in style and structure, the script's \"values and tone\" have been updated.<ref name=\":13\" /> The ''[[New York Daily News]]'' journalist [[Denene Millner]] observed that although the remake is \"not all that different from the original\", its version of Cinderella is more outspoken, the prince is more interested in finding someone he can talk to as opposed to simply \"another pretty

containing themes discussing self-reliance and love.<ref name=\":52\" /> According to George Rodosthenous, author of ''The Disney Musical on Stage and Screen: Critical Approaches from 'Snow White' to 'Frozen''', \"traces of sexism\" were removed from the script in favor of creating \"a prince for a new era\" while maintaining its \"fundamental storyline\";<ref name=\":18\">{{Cite

the hopes of better understanding them.<ref name=\":26\" /> Cinderella and the prince are also shown meeting and developing an interest in each other prior to the ball,<ref name=\":3\" /> lessening
