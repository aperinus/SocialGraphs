While a prosecution for obscenity did not result, the film was seized and confiscated in the UK under Section 3 of the [[Obscene Publications Act 1959]] during the [[video nasty]] panic.\n\n== Plot ==\nA young man, Martin, traveling on an overnight train from [[Indianapolis]] to [[Pittsburgh]], sedates a woman with a syringe full of narcotics, slices her forearm with a razor blade, then drinks her blood. The next morning, he is met at the Pittsburgh train station by his elderly cousin, Tateh Cuda, who escorts him to a second train destined for [[Braddock, Pennsylvania|Braddock]], [[Pennsylvania]]. Martin claims to be much older than his appearance would suggest. He has romantic [[monochrome]] visions of religious icons, vampiric seductions, and torch-carrying mobs, but whether these are memories or fantasies is not specified. Cuda, in accordance with family tradition, has reluctantly agreed to give Martin [[room and board]] alongside Cuda's orphaned granddaughter, Christina.\n\nCuda is a [[Lithuania]]n Catholic who treats Martin like an [[Old World]] [[vampire]], referring to him as \"[[Nosferatu (word)|Nosferatu]].\" He tries unsuccessfully to repel Martin with traditional methods, such as strings of garlic and a [[crucifix]]. Martin mocks these attempts and says bitterly, \"There's no real magic...ever.\" Christina is also highly skeptical and critical of Cuda's beliefs, and thinks Martin should receive psychiatric treatment. Cuda warns that if Martin murders anyone in Braddock, he will stake him through the heart.\n\nMartin seeks advice from a local radio [[disc jockey]], who dubs him \"The Count.\" He rejects many common perceptions about vampires, saying there is no \"magic stuff.\" The DJ's listeners consider Martin to be a hit. While making deliveries for Cuda's butcher shop, Martin meets a lonely, depressed housewife named Abbie Santini. When she touches Martin during an attempt at seducing him, he flees. Unbeknownst to his family, Martin goes to Pittsburgh and targets a woman he sees at a grocery store. Believing her to be alone while her husband is away on business, he breaks into her house but finds her in bed with a lover. After a series of struggles, Martin kills and feeds on the man instead of the woman, then drugs her before leaving the scene. Back in Braddock, Martin has [[sexual intercourse]] with Mrs. Santini, and they begin a full-fledged affair which lessens his appetite for blood.\n\nChristina becomes increasingly frustrated by her disagreements with Cuda, ultimately moving out of his house and bidding Martin goodbye. Worried about experiencing [[Drug withdrawal|withdrawal]], Martin goes on a feeding binge in the city; he attacks a pair of homeless derelicts and narrowly escapes the police. Upon returning to Braddock, he visits Mrs. Santini only to discover that she has committed [[suicide]] by cutting her wrists in a bathtub. Cuda, who has learned of Mrs. Santini's death, believes Martin to be her killer and fatally stakes him through the heart before burying him in a backyard flowerbed.\n\nRadio callers inquire and speculate about \"The Count\" while Tateh Cuda places a small crucifix atop Martin's grave.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n* [[John Amplas]] as Martin Mathias\n* [[Lincoln Maazel]] as Tateh Cuda\n* [[Christine Forrest]] as Christina\n* Elayne Nadeau as Abbie Santini\n* [[Tom Savini]] as Arthur\n* Sara Venable as housewife victim\n* Fran Middleton as train victim\n* Roger Caine as Lewis {{small|(as Al Levitsky)}}\n* [[George A.

They are beasts we've created in order to exorcise the monster from within us...I tried to show in ''Martin'' that you can't just slice off this evil part of ourselves and throw it away.
