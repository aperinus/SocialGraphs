Released in 2012 at the [[Venice Film Festival]], the film was directed by [[Ariel Vromen]], and stars [[Michael Shannon]] as Kuklinski, [[Winona Ryder]], [[Chris Evans (actor)|Chris Evans]], and [[Ray Liotta]].\n\nThe movie was presented at Venice film festival.

It expanded into more cinemas in the USA on May 17. It was released to DVD on September 3.\n\n==Plot==\nWhen a man insults [[Richard Kuklinski]]'s fianc\u00e9e during a game of pool, he follows the man to his car and murders him by slashing his throat. Kuklinski marries Deborah in 1964 and the couple have two daughters. Kuklinski presents himself to everyone as a normal working man, but he has a dark, violent side that he hides. As a boy he and his younger brother were the subject of brutal beatings from their immigrant [[Poles|Polish]] father, shaping the boys into emotionally disturbed, sadistic young men. His brother is serving a life sentence in prison for raping and murdering a 12-year old girl.\n\nKuklinski works dubbing pornographic films, but tells his wife he dubs cartoons. The mob-backed company he works for is shut down by [[Roy DeMeo]], a powerful New York City gangster. DeMeo tests Kuklinski by having him kill a homeless man then hires him as an enforcer and contract killer. In 1975, Kuklinski moves his family into a nice suburban home and starts telling people he works at a [[Foreign exchange market|currency trading]] company. He is ordered to kill a man who betrayed DeMeo, but finds a teenage girl in the closet afterwards. Freezy, a freelance hitman also hired by DeMeo, almost kills her, but is stopped by Kuklinski. DeMeo, already involved in a dispute with the [[Cali Cartel]], is furious when he learns what happened and decommissions Kuklinski indefinitely. Needing money, he makes a deal with Freezy to carry out his murder contracts for him in return for half the bounties.\n\nKuklinski's home life is beginning to unravel. He starts becoming incapable of hiding his inner rage and shows bursts of anger towards his wife and strangers. DeMeo's boss Leo Merks hires Freezy to kill one of DeMeo's associates, which Kuklinski does by poisoning him with [[cyanide]]. DeMeo finds out about the hits Kuklinski has been doing behind his back and threatens to kill his family if they ever cross paths again. Kuklinski then goes to Leo Merks to collect the bounty money, but Leo is furious that the job was not untraceable. He refuses to pay anything, prompting Kuklinski to shoot him dead. Kuklinski's daughter is hospitalized after a hit and run by DeMeo. Both Kuklinski and Freezy have to go on the run to escape DeMeo, but Kuklinski kills Freezy for suggesting that they kill each other's families to prevent them from talking to the police and then claiming that he already knows where Kuklinski lives (although Kuklinski is certain that he has never mentioned his address to Freezy).\n\nFollowing an undercover sting operation, Kuklinski is arrested in 1986. Neither his wife nor his daughters had ever suspected him of being a killer. Kuklinski admits to having committed over 100 murders, both for personal reasons and for profit, in his 22-year career. After being sentenced to two life terms in prison, he never sees his wife and daughters again. As the movie ends, Kuklinski's only regret is hurting his family through the crimes he committed. In 2006, he dies in a prison hospital, from a rare inflammatory disease; the film's closing [[intertitle]]s indicate that foul play was suspected in his death as he was scheduled to testify at the trial of a [[Gambino crime family|Gambino family]] underboss.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Michael Shannon]] as [[Richard Kuklinski]]<ref name=\"Cast\">Newman, Nick (2011-01-21).
