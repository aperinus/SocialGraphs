The film was executive produced by [[Wes Craven]], and is the only film of the ''Wishmaster'' series with his name attached. Its plot concerns a [[djinn]], a wish-granting, evil genie who is released from a jewel and seeks to capture the soul of the woman who discovered him, thereby opening a portal and freeing his fellow djinn to inhabit and enslave the Earth.\n\nThe film stars [[Andrew Divoff]] as The Djinn and [[Tammy Lauren]].\n\nThe film was followed by three sequels, ''[[Wishmaster 2: Evil Never Dies]]'' (1999), ''[[Wishmaster 3: Beyond the Gates of Hell]]'' (2001) and ''[[Wishmaster: The Prophecy Fulfilled]]'' (2002). The first and second movies are considered to be in the horror genre, while the third and fourth movies have less horror elements and are more associated with action and romance films.\n\n==Plot==\nA narrator ([[Angus Scrimm]]) explains that when \"God breathed life into the universe\u2026the light gave birth to Angels\u2026the earth gave birth to man...the fire gave birth to the djinn, creatures condemned to dwell in the void between the worlds.\" If a person wakes a djinn they will receive three wishes, but the third wish will free legions of djinn on Earth. In 1127, one of these Djinn ([[Andrew Divoff]]) asks a Persian emperor to make his second wish. When the emperor wishes to see wonders, the Djinn uses his powers to torture and mutilate people in the palace. The emperor is horrified, but the Djinn tells him to use his third wish to set things right. Before the emperor can make his third wish, [[Zoroaster]] (Ari Barak), a [[Magician (fantasy)|sorcerer]], explains the consequences of the third wish and reveals a [[opal#Other varieties of opal|fire opal]], which pulls the Djinn inside and traps him.\n\nIn present-day America, Raymond Beaumont ([[Robert Englund]]) supervises workers lowering a box containing an antique statue of [[Ahura Mazda]] onto a ship. The crane operator Mickey Torelli ([[Joseph Pilato]]) is [[Alcohol intoxication|drunk]] and drops the box, killing Beaumont's assistant Ed Finley ([[Ted Raimi]]) and destroying the statue. A [[stevedore|dockworker]] steals the fire opal from the rubble and [[pawnbroker|pawns]] it. Eventually the jewel reaches Regal Auctioneers, where Nick Merritt ([[Chris Lemmon]]) instructs appraiser Alexandra \"Alex\" Amberson ([[Tammy Lauren]]) to examine it, which wakes the Djinn. Alex sees something inside the jewel and leaves it with her close friend and colleague, Josh Aickman (Tony Crane), to analyze. As he is collecting data, the gem explodes, destroying the lab and releasing the Djinn. Josh, wounded, wishes for relief from his physical pain, and the Djinn \"grants\" his wish by killing him.\n\nAlex, having been informed of Josh's death by Lieutenant Nathanson ([[Ricco Ross]]), tracks the gem to the statue which she tracks to Beaumont, who sends Alex to visit Wendy Derleth ([[Jenny O'Hara]]), a folklore professor, who explains the history of the gem and the nature of the djinn: a djinn grants wishes in exchange for souls, but as djinns are [[demon]]ic in nature, the wishes will be twisted into curses for the djinn's amusement. Later, Alex learns that the Djinn needs to power the gem with human souls and then grant her (the person who originally released him) three wishes before he can open the gateway to release his fellow djinn on Earth; meanwhile, the Djinn takes the form of a dead man and uses the name Nathaniel Demerest. He kills a pharmacist ([[Reggie Bannister]]) with the wish of a vengeful vagrant ([[George 'Buck' Flower]]) and grants sales clerk Ariella's ([[Gretchen Palmer]]) wish for eternal beauty by turning her into a [[mannequin]]. Searching for Alex, he goes to Nathanson to gain her information.  Nathanson refuses to help him, but the Djinn grants Nathanson's wish to easily prove a criminal's guilt by having the criminal go on a shooting spree inside the police precinct, and in the chaos finds Alex's home address and leaves.\n\nHe next visits Nick, killing a security guard ([[Kane Hodder]]) along the way by fusing him into [[stained glass]] (when the guard says he'd \"like to see\" the Djinn \"go through me\"). Nick facetiously agrees to help in exchange for a million dollars - which he receives when his mother takes out a [[life insurance]] policy and is killed the next day in a plane crash.\n\nAlex sees troubling visions every time the Djinn grants wishes. She consults Derleth again, but soon realizes that she is talking to the Djinn, who has killed Derleth and taken her form. The Djinn confronts Alex and offers her three wishes. In the spirit of [[Sportsmanship|fair play]], he offers her a \"free\" wish, just to see what will happen.  She wishes for him to shoot himself, but he is [[Immortality|immortal]] and the gunshot fails to harm him. Using the first of her three official wishes, Alex wishes to know what he is. The Djinn [[Teleportation|teleports]] her to his hellish world within the gem which terrifies her as he boasts his evil to her. She then wishes herself to escape back to her apartment, alone.\n\nThe Djinn had been threatening Alex's sister, Shannon ([[Wendy Benson]]), so Alex hurries to a party Beaumont invited them to earlier. The Djinn follows, again disguised as Nathaniel Demerest. Alex tells doorman Johnny Valentine ([[Tony Todd]]) to hold the Djinn, as he is trying to kill her; however, the Djinn manipulates Valentine into making a wish \"to escape [his routine life]\", allowing the Djinn to trap Valentine in a [[Chinese water torture cell]], making his way into the party. The Djinn charms Beaumont, who wishes his party would be unforgettable, and thus the Djinn causes artwork to kill Beaumont, the guests, and the security guards called in to help. Eventually the Djinn corners the sisters and attempts to scare Alex into making her third wish by trapping Shannon in a burning painting.\n\nAlex wishes that Torelli had not been drunk at work two days ago, which the Djinn is forced to grant, but this undoes the events that followed the destruction of the statue and traps the djinn in the fire opal again. The now sober Torelli lowers the crate with no problems. Alex visits Josh \u2014 now alive again \u2014 who notices that Alex seems pleased with herself, though she does not explain why. Inside the jewel on the statue of Ahura Mazda \u2014 now in Beaumont's private collection \u2014 the Djinn sits on a throne, waiting to be released.\n\n==Cast==\n\n=== Main cast ===\n* [[Tammy Lauren]] as Alexandra Amberson\n* [[Andrew Divoff]] as The Djinn / Nathaniel Demerest\n* [[Robert Englund]] as Raymond Beaumont\n* [[Chris Lemmon]] as Nick Merritt\n* [[Wendy Benson]] as Shannon Amberson\n* Tony Crane as Josh Aickman\n* [[Jenny O'Hara]] as Wendy Derleth\n* [[Ricco Ross]] as Lieutenant Nathanson\n* [[Gretchen Palmer]] as Ariella\n\n=== Cameos ===\n* [[Angus Scrimm]] as narrator (voice only)\n* [[George 'Buck' Flower]] as Homeless Man\n* [[Ted Raimi]] as Ed Finney\n* [[Kane Hodder]] as Merritt's Guard\n* [[Tony Todd]] as Johnny Valentine\n* [[Reggie Bannister]] as Pharmacist\n* [[Joseph Pilato]] as Torelli\n* [[Dennis Hayden (actor)|Dennis Hayden]] as Security Guard\n* [[Tom Savini]] as Man in Pharmacy\n\n==Production==\n\n===Casting and cameos===\n''Wishmaster'' is notable for featuring many actors from popular horror films. [[Robert Englund]], who was [[Freddy Krueger]] in the ''[[A Nightmare on Elm Street|Nightmare on Elm Street]]'' series, played an antique collector and [[Kane Hodder]], who played [[Jason Voorhees]] in the ''[[Friday the 13th (franchise)|Friday the 13th]]'' series, played a security guard. Also in the film were [[Tony Todd]] from ''[[Candyman (1992 film)|Candyman]]'', [[Ted Raimi]] from ''Candyman'', ''[[Darkman]]'', ''[[Evil Dead II]]'' and ''[[Army of Darkness]]'', [[Ricco Ross]] from ''[[Aliens (film)|Aliens]]'', [[Joseph Pilato]] from ''[[Day of the Dead (1985 film)|Day of the Dead]]'', [[Reggie Bannister]] and the voice of [[Angus Scrimm]] (From the ''[[Phantasm (film)|Phantasm]]'' films), [[Jenny O'Hara]] from the later ''[[Devil (2010 film)|Devil]]'', [[Jack Lemmon]]'s son [[Chris Lemmon]] from ''[[Just Before Dawn (1981 film)|Just Before Dawn]]'' and [[George 'Buck' Flower]] (who was often used in small parts in various horror movies of the 1980s and early 1990s, often directed by [[John Carpenter]]). [[Verne Troyer]] of later ''[[Austin Powers]]'' fame appears as the smaller Wishmaster when he first escapes from his gem prison. A Pazuzu statue, a personification of the demonic figure which possessed [[Linda Blair]]'s character in ''[[The Exorcist (film series)|The Exorcist]]'' [[The Exorcist (film series)|series]], also appeared. This can be seen in Beaumont's collection room and on display during the party scene where it attacks some of the guests, though it is not formally referenced. A veiled reference to the [[Cthulhu Mythos]] can be heard in the incantation used to imprison the Djinn; the words \"Nib Shuggurath\", a [[spoonerism]] of [[Shub-Niggurath]]. Makeup artist [[Tom Savini]] also appears in a cameo as a customer at the pharmacy when Reggie Bannister's character dies.\n\nMany crew members, including director Robert Kurtzman (man killed by piano), had small cameos in the film.\n\n===Writing===\nWriter Peter Atkins, also known for his work on ''[[Hellraiser (franchise)|Hellraiser]]'' films, intentionally made some surnames of characters in the film (Beaumont, Finney, Etchison, Clegg, Derleth, Merritt and Aickman) match the names of writers of horror and fantasy fiction. Josh Aickman (played by Tony Crane), explains to Alexandra Amberson (played by Tammy Lauren) that he can't test the opal immediately because he has, \"...about 2 hours' worth of Professor Leiber's bullshit to take care of first.\" This Professor does not make an appearance in the film and is not listed in the credits but is a reference to horror, fantasy, science fiction writer Fritz Leiber.\n\n==Reception==\n===Box office===\n''Wishmaster'' was shot on an estimated budget of [[United States dollar|US$]]5 million and its total domestic gross was US$15,738,769. During its opening weekend in theaters, 19\u201321 September 1997, ''Wishmaster'' made US$6,000,000, putting it in third place at the box office, behind ''[[In & Out (film)|In & Out]]'' (which was debuting in first place) and ''[[The Game (1997 film)|The Game]]'' (which was in second place during its second week).<ref name=\"mojo\">{{cite web |url=https://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=wishmaster.htm |title=Wishmaster (1997) |work=[[Box Office Mojo]] |access-date=25 July 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Critical response===\nThe film was panned by critics.
