The film stars [[Patrick Wayne]], [[Taryn Power]], [[Jane Seymour (actress)|Jane Seymour]] and [[Patrick Troughton]]. The third and final ''Sinbad'' film released by [[Columbia Pictures]], it follows ''[[The 7th Voyage of Sinbad]]'' (1958) and ''[[The Golden Voyage of Sinbad]]'' (1973).\n\n==Plot==\nIn the kingdom of Charak, a celebration is taking place for the coronation of Prince Kassim, but Kassim's evil stepmother, Zenobia, places a curse on him just as he is going to be crowned [[Caliphate|Caliph]]. Sinbad, a sailor and Prince of [[Baghdad]], moors at Charak some time later, intent on seeking permission from Prince Kassim to marry Kassim's sister, Princess Farah, but finds the city under curfew. Sinbad and his men are offered hospitality by a man named Rafi, but during their meal one of Sinbad's crew is poisoned and the rest are attacked by Rafi, who is Zenobia's son. Sinbad defeats him, but Zenobia summons a trio of [[ghoul]]s, which attack Sinbad and his men. Sinbad disposes of the ghouls by crushing them under a pile of huge logs.\n\nSinbad meets with Farah, who believes that Kassim's curse is one of Zenobia's spells, and unless Kassim is cured within seven moons, then Zenobia's son Rafi will become caliph instead. Sinbad, Farah and Sinbad's crew set off to find the old [[Greeks|Greek]] [[alchemist]] Melanthius, a [[hermit]] on the island of Casgar, who is said to know how to break curses, and Farah brings with her a [[Dinopithecus|huge prehistoric baboon]], who is really Kassim, transformed by Zenobia's curse. Zenobia and Rafi follow in a boat propelled by the Minoton, a magical bronze automaton created by the sorceress with the appearance of a [[minotaur]].\n\nSinbad and Farah land at Casgar and find Melanthius and his daughter Dione, who agree to help them. Melanthius says they must travel to the land of [[Hyperborea]] where the ancient civilization of the Arimaspi once existed. On the way to Hyperborea, Kassim enjoys having Dione's company and develops a love interest towards her.\n\nZenobia uses a potion to transform herself into a seagull to spy on Sinbad. Once aboard his ship, she turns into a miniature human and listens as Melanthius tells Sinbad how to cure Kassim. Alerted by Kassim, Melanthius and Sinbad capture Zenobia. Unfortunately, her potion vial spills and a wasp ingests some of it. The wasp grows to enormous size and attacks the two men, but Sinbad kills it. Zenobia uses her remaining potion to become a seagull again and fly back to her own ship, but with not enough potion left, the lower part of her right leg remains a seagull's foot.\n\nAfter a long voyage, Sinbad's ship reaches the north polar wastelands. Sinbad and his crew trek across the ice to the land of the [[Arimaspi]], but are attacked by a giant [[walrus]]. It destroys most of their supplies and kills two men, but Sinbad and the others fend it off with spears. Zenobia uses an ice tunnel to reach the land of the Arimaspi, and she, Rafi and the Minoton climb subterranean stairs to emerge in the warm, Mediterranean-like valley above.\n\nSinbad and his crew also reach the valley. While resting, they encounter a [[Troglodytae|troglodyte]], an {{convert|8|ft|m|adj=mid|-tall}}, fur-covered [[caveman]]-like being with a single horn on the top of its head. The troglodyte proves not dangerous, but rather friendly. The adventurers name him Trog for short, and he leads them to the giant pyramidal shrine of the Arimaspi. Zenobia and Rafi arrive at the shrine first, but as she has no key to enter, Zenobia orders the Minoton to remove a block of stone from the pyramid's wall. He succeeds, but the block crushes the Minoton and destabilizes the pyramids structure and thus the shrine's power.\n\nSinbad and his friends arrive minutes later and enter the shrine's main chamber, the interior of which is covered in ice and is guarded by \"The Guardian of the Shrine\", a [[smilodon]] frozen in a block of ice. Zenobia orders Rafi to attack Melanthius and is about to stab Dione with a knife, but Rafi is attacked by Kassim and is killed falling down the temple stairs. Momentarily overcome with grief, Zenobia cradles her son while Sinbad and Melanthius raise Kassim into the column of light at the top of the shrine, which breaks the spell on him. Seeing Kassim restored to human form, Zenobia transfers her spirit into the smilodon. Breaking free of its icy prison, the giant tiger attacks the group, but Trog engages the smilodon in combat wielding Minoton's spear. Initially gaining the upper hand, Trog is disarmed, overcome and killed. Sinbad and his men fight against the beast, but find themselves outmatched. The smilodon attacks Sinbad, who impales it on Minoton's spear, killing both it and Zenobia. The adventurers flee the temple as it collapses, becoming buried in snow and ice as the Mediterranean-like atmosphere disappears and is replaced by the freezing polar winds.\n\nSinbad, Kassim, Farah, Melanthius and Dione return home just in time for Kassim to be crowned Caliph. Amidst the celebration, the film fades to black and the eyes of Zenobia appear on the screen.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Patrick Wayne]] as Sinbad\n* [[Taryn Power]] as Dione\n* [[Margaret Whiting (actress)|Margaret Whiting]] as Zenobia\n* [[Jane Seymour (actress)|Jane Seymour]] as Farah\n* [[Patrick Troughton]] as Melanthius\n* [[Kurt Christian]] as Rafi\n* [[Nadim Sawalha]] as Hassan\n* [[Damien Thomas]] as Kassim\n* [[Bruno Barnabe]] as Balsora\n* [[Bernard Kay]] as Zabid\n* Salami Coker as Maroof\n* [[David Sterne]] as Aboo-Seer\n* [[Peter Mayhew]] as Minoton\n\n==Production==\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Sinbad Trog.jpg|thumb|150px|left|The Troglodyte, a stop-motion animation creature created by Ray Harryhausen.]] -->\nThe strong box office success of ''[[The Golden Voyage of Sinbad]]'' led Columbia Pictures executives to begin work on a third Sinbad motion picture with the second still in theatrical release.

The massive doors and deadbolt to the ancient shrine of the [[Arimaspi]] in the [[arctic]] were based on a similar set of doors in 1933's ''[[King Kong (1933 film)|King Kong]]''. The interior of the shrine was very similar to the shrine set in the 1935 motion picture ''[[She (1935 film)|She]]'', complete with steep pyramidal steps, a vortex of light coming from above, and a [[smilodon]] encased in ice.<ref name=\"Webber196\">Webber, p. 196.</ref> The power source of the shrine of Arimaspi was actually made of dental floss. Harryhausen and the crew mounted dozens of floss fiber strands around a cylinder-like construction made of gauze, and this was mounted on a revolving mechanism and put in front of black velvet. It was then pulled out of focus to create shimmering and an inky light was run up and down the system to give it reflections.<ref>Dalton, Tony. ''Ray Harryhausen: An Animated Life.'' London: Aurum, 2003, pgs. 250-252.</ref>\n\nHarryhausen originally planned for an [[Arsinoitherium]] to make an appearance in the film. The massive, two-horned prehistoric rhinoceros-like creature was intended to fight the [[Troglodytae|troglodyte]] in Hyperborea's land before the latter meeting with the protagonists. Harryhausen did preproduction designs showing the beast defeating the troglodyte, then getting caught and dying in a pool of hot tar.<ref name=\"Webber196\"/> Harryhausen also said he planned to have Sinbad and his crew fight a [[yeti]] in the arctic, but that idea was ultimately rejected in favor of a giant walrus.<ref>Dalton, Tony. ''The Art of Ray Harryhausen.'' London: Aurum, 2005, p. 162.</ref> Other Harryhausen's ideas were a [[woolly mammoth]] as the creature which Sinbad's crew meet in the arctic. Harryhausen's [[stop-motion]] animation work lasted from October 1975 up to March 1977.\n\nThe stop-motion troglodyte figurine used in the film was later cannibalized to make the Calibos character in Harryhausen's 1981 film, ''[[Clash of the Titans (1981 film)|Clash of the Titans]]''.<ref name=\"Webber196\"/>\n\nThe film featured a nude sunbathing scene by Jane Seymour. \"The nudity came about in the development of the picture\", said Schneer. \"I wanted to keep up with those elements that had become plausible.\"<ref name=\"steve\"/>\n\n==Home media==\n'''Blu-ray'''\n'''''ALL America \u2013 Twilight Time \u2013 The Limited Edition Series'''''<ref>[http://www.blu-ray.com/movies/Sinbad-and-the-Eye-of-the-Tiger-Blu-ray/80978/#Review Blu-ray.com]</ref>\n* '''Picture Format:''' 1.85:1 (1080p 24fps) [AVC MPEG-4]\n* '''Soundtrack(s):''' English (DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1)\n* '''Subtitles:''' English\n* '''Extras:'''\n* Isolated Score (DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1)\n* This is Dynamation (Featurette) (3:25, 480p)\n* Theatrical Trailer (2:15, 1080p)\n* '''Case type:''' Keep Case\n* '''Notes:''' Limited to 3,000 copies (none are numbered)\n\n'''DVD'''\n'''''R1 America \u2013 Columbia/Tri-star Home Entertainment'''''<ref>[http://www.dvdcompare.net/comparisons/film.php?fid=2286 Dvdcompare.net]</ref>\n* '''Picture Format:''' 1.85:1 (Anamorphic) [NTSC]\n* '''Soundtrack(s):''' English Dolby Digital 2.0 mono\n* '''Subtitles:''' Chinese, English, Korean, Portuguese, Spanish and Thai\n* Extras:\n* Theatrical trailer\n* ''[[Ray Harryhausen]] Chronicles'' \u2013 Documentary (57:53 min.)\n* ''This is Dynamation'' (vintage extended trailer, originally used as a teaser for ''The 7th Voyage of Sinbad'', 3:27 min.)\n* Bonus trailers: ''[[20 Million Miles to Earth]]'', ''[[The 7th Voyage of Sinbad]]'', ''[[Jason and the Argonauts (1963 film)|Jason and the Argonauts]]'', ''[[Earth vs. the Flying Saucers]]'' and ''[[The 3 Worlds of Gulliver]]''\n* Cast & crew filmographies and biographies\n* Booklet, with production notes\n* '''Case type:''' Keep Case\n* '''Notes:''' Also in a 3-disc ''The Sinbad Collection'' box set, with ''[[The Golden Voyage of Sinbad]]'' and ''The 7th Voyage of Sinbad''.\n\n==Critical reception==\nThe film was released in the same summer as the original ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'' film, and suffered in comparison to that science fiction epic.<ref>Kinnard, Roy.

Harryhausen biographer Roy P. Webber found the [[ghoul]]s highly derivative of the [[Skeleton (undead)|skeleton warriors]] from ''Jason and the Argonauts'', with the heads strongly reminiscent of the Selenites from Harryhausen's 1964 effort, ''[[First Men in the Moon (1964 film)|First Men in the Moon]]''.<ref>Webber, p. 197-198.</ref> He also found the Minoton and the giant wasp to be lacking in character and so ancillary to the plot as to be dismissed.<ref name=\"Webber198\">Webber, p. 198.</ref> Harryhausen later admitted that the picture was too rushed, which led to many characterization problems in the animation.<ref>Dalton, p. 184.</ref>\n\nOther cinematic effects in the film have also been criticized. Webber, for example, notes that the traveling mattes used in the film to include various filmed elements are very poorly done, and the special effects used to show Zenobia transforming into a gull are \"so bad that it is truly laughable.\"<ref name=\"Webber198\"/>\n\nHowever, some aspects of the film have received enduring praise. Webber notes that the baboon animation was so good that many people were fooled into believing a real animal had been used. The battle between the [[Troglodytae|troglodyte]] and the [[smilodon]] is much better choreographed than the battle between the one-eyed [[centaur]] and the [[griffin]] in ''The Golden Voyage of Sinbad'', and much more dramatic (with the [[Machairodontinae|cat]] actually raking with its claws and biting with its teeth, leaving deep wounds on its opponent).<ref name=\"Webber198\"/>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|0076716|Sinbad and the Eye of the Tiger}}\n* [https://www.moviefone.com/movie/sinbad-and-the-eye-of-the-tiger/1032051/main/ ''Sinbad and the Eye of the Tiger''] at [[Moviephone]]\n* {{AllMovie title|44818|Sinbad and the Eye of the Tiger}}\n* {{Rotten Tomatoes|sinbad_and_the_eye_of_the_tiger|Sinbad and the Eye of the Tiger}}\n* {{TCMDb title|4226|Sinbad and the Eye of the Tiger}}\n* {{AFI film|id=56037|title=Sinbad and the Eye of the Tiger}}\n\n{{Ray Harryhausen}}\n{{Sinbad the Sailor}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Sinbad And The Eye Of The Tiger}}\n[[Category:1977 films]]\n[[Category:1970s fantasy adventure films]]\n[[Category:British fantasy adventure films]]\n[[Category:Seafaring films]]\n[[Category:1970s English-language films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Sam Wanamaker]]\n[[Category:Films based on Sinbad the Sailor]]\n[[Category:1970s monster movies]]\n[[Category:British monster movies]]\n[[Category:Films using stop-motion animation]]\n[[Category:Films set in the Arctic]]\n[[Category:Films set in the 8th century]]\n[[Category:Columbia Pictures films]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Almer\u00eda]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Roy Budd]]\n[[Category:American fantasy adventure films]]\n[[Category:American monster movies]]\n[[Category:Films about shapeshifting]]\n[[Category:Films produced by Ray Harryhausen]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by Ray Harryhausen]]\n[[Category:Films produced by Charles H.
