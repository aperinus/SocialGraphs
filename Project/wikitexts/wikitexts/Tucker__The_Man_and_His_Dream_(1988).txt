The film recounts the story of [[Preston Tucker]] and his attempt to produce and market the [[1948 Tucker Sedan]], which was met with scandal between the \"[[Big Three (automobile manufacturers)|Big Three automobile manufacturers]]\" and accusations of stock fraud from the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]]. [[Joan Allen]], [[Martin Landau]], [[Elias Koteas]], [[Frederic Forrest]] and [[Christian Slater]] appear in supporting roles. Landau won the [[Golden Globe Award]] for [[Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor \u2013 Motion Picture|Best Supporting Actor]] and was nominated for the [[Academy Award]] in the same category.\n\nIn 1973, Coppola began development of a film based on the life of Tucker, originally with [[Marlon Brando]] in the lead role. Starting in 1976, Coppola planned ''Tucker'' to be both a musical and an [[experimental film]] with music and lyrics written by [[Leonard Bernstein]], [[Betty Comden]] and [[Adolph Green]]. The project eventually collapsed when Coppola's [[American Zoetrope]] experienced financial problems. ''Tucker'' was revived in 1986 when Coppola's friend, [[George Lucas]], joined as an executive producer.\n\nThe film received positive reviews from critics but was a box office failure. ''Tucker: The Man and His Dream'' produced a spike in prices of Tucker Sedans, as well as a renewed appreciation for Tucker and his automobiles.\n{{TOC limit|limit=2}}\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Please review the guidelines at WP:FILMPLOT before adding material. The word count in this section should be 400-700 words. -->\n[[Detroit, Michigan|Detroit]] engineer [[Preston Tucker]] has been interested in building cars since childhood. During [[World War II]] he designed an [[Armored car (military)|armored car]] for the military and made money building gun turrets for aircraft in a small shop next to his home in [[Ypsilanti, Michigan]]. Tucker is supported by his large extended family, particularly: wife Vera; sons Preston Jr. and Noble; daughter Marilyn Lee.\n\nAs the war winds down, Tucker becomes inspired to build the \"car of the future\". The \"Tucker Torpedo\" will feature revolutionary safety designs, including disc brakes, seatbelts, a pop-out windshield, and headlights which swivel when you turn. Tucker hires young designer [[Alex Tremulis]] to help with the design and enlists New York financier Abe Karatz to arrange financial support. Raising the money through a stock issue, Tucker and Karatz acquire the enormous [[Dodge Chicago Plant]] to begin manufacturing. Abe hires Robert Bennington to run the new Tucker Corporation on a day-to-day basis.\n\nLaunching \"the car of tomorrow\" in a spectacular way, the Tucker Corporation is met with enthusiasm from [[shareholder]]s and the general public. However, the Tucker company [[board of directors]], unsure of his ability to overcome the technical and financial obstacles ahead, send Tucker off on a publicity campaign and attempt to take complete control of the company. While Tucker travels the country, Bennington and directors change the design of Tucker's car to a more conventional design, eliminating the safety and engineering advances Tucker was advertising. At the same time, Tucker faces animosity from the Big Three automakers -- [[General Motors]], [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] and [[Chrysler Corporation|Chrysler]]\u2014and from the authorities, led by Michigan Senator [[Homer S. Ferguson]].\n\nTucker returns from his publicity tour and confronts Bennington, who curtly informs him that he no longer has any power in the company to make decisions, that the engine originally planned for the car is not viable. Tucker then receives a call from [[Howard Hughes]], who sends a private plane to bring Tucker to his aircraft manufacturing site. Hughes advises Tucker to purchase the [[Franklin Engine Company|Aircooled Motors Company]], which can supply both the steel Tucker needs, as well as a small, powerful helicopter engine that might replace Tucker's original \"589\" power plant.\n\nUnable to change Bennington's design, Tucker modifies the new engine. He installs it in a test Tucker, in the secrecy of his backyard tool-and-die shop. This prototype proves successful, both in durability and in crash-testing. However, Tucker is confronted with allegations of stock fraud. Ferguson's investigation with the U.S. [[Securities and Exchange Commission]] (SEC) causes Karatz\u2014once convicted of bank fraud\u2014to resign out of fear that his criminal record will prejudice the hearings. [[Yellow journalism]] all but ruins Tucker's public image; yet the ultimate courtroom battle is resolved when he parades his entire production run of 50 Tucker Torpedoes, proving that he has reached production status.\n\nAfter giving a speech to the jurors on how [[capitalism]] in the United States is harmed by efforts of large corporations against small entrepreneurs like himself, Tucker is acquitted on all charges, although his company falls into [[bankruptcy]].\n\nIn the film's closing shot, Tucker's entire production line\u2014fifty \"cars of the future\"\u2014is driven through the streets of downtown Chicago, admired by everyone as they pass.\n\n===Epilogue===\nAlthough only 50 Tucker Torpedoes were ever produced, 46 of them are still roadworthy and in use today (as of 1988). Many of Tucker's innovations\u2014aerodynamic styling, padded dash, pop-out windows, seatbelts, fuel injection and disc brakes\u2014were gradually adopted by Detroit and are found in the cars produced today. Preston Tucker died of [[lung cancer]] six years after the trial.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Jeff Bridges]] as [[Preston Tucker]]\n* [[Joan Allen]] as Vera Tucker\n* [[Martin Landau]] as Abe Karatz\n* [[Elias Koteas]] as [[Alex Tremulis]]\n* [[Frederic Forrest]] as Eddie Dean\n* [[Christian Slater]] as Preston Tucker, Jr.\n* [[Don Novello]] as Stan\n* [[Nina Siemaszko]] as Marilyn Lee Tucker\n* [[Mako Iwamatsu|Mako]] as Jimmy Sakuyama\n* [[Dean Stockwell]] as [[Howard Hughes]]\n* [[Lloyd Bridges]] as Senator [[Homer S.
