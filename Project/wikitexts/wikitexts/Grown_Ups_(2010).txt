The film tells a story of five lifelong friends who won their junior high school basketball championship in 1978. They reunite three decades later for a [[Independence Day (United States)|4th of July]] weekend after learning about the sudden death of their basketball coach.\n\n''Grown Ups'' was produced by Sandler's production company [[Happy Madison Productions]] and was distributed by [[Columbia Pictures]].<ref>{{cite news |date=February 10, 2009 |author=Tatiana Siegel |work=Variety |url= https://variety.com/2009/film/markets-festivals/columbia-pic-gets-sandler-and-friends-1117999951/ |title=Columbia pic gets Sandler and friends |access-date=January 1, 2021 }}</ref> Despite receiving unfavorable reviews from critics, it grossed $271 million and led to a sequel, ''[[Grown Ups 2]],'' in 2013.\n\n== Plot ==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, the plot summary should be 400-700 words. -->\nIn 1978, childhood friends Lenny Feder, Eric Lamonsoff, Kurt McKenzie, Marcus Higgins, and Rob Hilliard win their junior high basketball championship. They celebrate at a lake house with their coach Robert \"Buzzer\" Ferdinando.\n\nThirty years later in 2008, Lenny is a wealthy and successful Hollywood [[talent agent]], married to fashion designer Roxanne and has three children named Greg, Keithie, and Becky. Eric claims to co-own a lawn furniture company and has two children named Donna and Bean. His wife Sally still [[Breastfeeding|breastfeed]]s Bean. Kurt is a stay-at-home father, and has two children named Andre and Charlotte, his wife Deanne is pregnant with their third child, and her mother Ronzoni lives with them. Marcus is a [[slacker]] and [[lothario]]. Rob is married to his [[cougar (slang)|much older]] fourth wife Gloria.\n\nWhen Buzzer dies, the five friends reunite for his funeral in their hometown with their families. Lenny rents the Earnshaw family's lake house for everyone to stay over [[Independence Day (United States)|Fourth of July]] weekend, though his family is leaving early to attend Roxanne's fashion show in [[Milan]]. He pushes Greg and Keithie to play outside and runs into his childhood opponent Dickie, who claims Lenny's foot was out of bounds when he made the winning shot.\n\nAs the friends spread Buzzer's ashes, Rob breaks down over his failed marriages and reveals that he has invited his estranged daughters Jasmine, Amber, and Bridget to visit. The men play \u201c[[Russian roulette|arrow roulette]]\u201d, shooting an arrow straight into the air, and Rob wins by not running for cover, but the arrow impales his left foot. Lenny is thrilled to find the kids playing with [[tin can telephone|cup-and-string telephones]]. Roxanne realizes the positive impact the weekend is having on their children and tells Lenny to cancel their Milan trip and stay at the lake instead.\n\nEveryone visits [[Water Wizz]] where Marcus flirts with Jasmine and Amber after buying them skimpy bikinis, and Eric teaches Bean to drink cow's milk. The families cause chaos throughout the park: the wives attract a [[bodybuilding|bodybuilder]], then jeer at his high-pitched Canadian accent; Rob assaults slide attendant Norby when he insults Bridget, and Eric ignores Donna's warning about a chemical in the children's pool that turns urine blue. At the zipline attraction, Lenny's group meets up with Dickie and his former teammates including Wiley, who is severely injured after crashing into a shed while sliding down the zipline on his feet.\n\nReturning to the lake house, Lenny teaches his son to shoot a [[Basketball moves#Bank shot|bank shot]], and the couples end the night dancing together.\n\nThe next day, Rob attacks Marcus, mistakenly believing that he slept with Jasmine, and Marcus admits to feeling insecure compared to his happily married friends. Everyone comes clean about the state of their lives: Roxanne confronts Lenny for canceling their flight to Milan before they left home, and he admits that he wanted their family to have a normal vacation; Deanne confronts Kurt for spending time with the Feders' nanny Rita, but Kurt retaliates by pointing out how she under-appreciates him; Eric reveals that he was laid off from his job; and Rob admits what everybody already knows \u2013 that he wears a [[toupee]]. Gloria helps everyone reconcile, and Lenny and Kurt offer to help Eric start a new business.\n\nOn their last day at the lake house, Lenny and his friends agree to a rematch against Dickie, Robideaux, Muzby, Tardio, and Malcolm. The game culminates in Lenny and Greg facing Dickie and his son, but Lenny misses the game-deciding shot. As the families watch the Fourth of July fireworks, Lenny tells Roxanne that he let Dickie's family win to get him off his case, and felt that his own family needed to know what losing feels like. A drunken Marcus plays another game of arrow roulette, and the crowd flees in panic. Trapped in a [[orthopedic cast|full-body cast]], Wiley is struck in the foot by the arrow declaring \"We win again!\" before fainting.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Adam Sandler]] as Lenny Feder, a Hollywood talent agent.\n** Michael Cavaleri as Young Lenny Feder \n* [[Kevin James]] as Eric Lamonsoff, a friend of Lenny and former worker at Branchville Lawn Furniture.\n** Andrew Bayard as Young Eric Lamonsoff\n* [[Chris Rock]] as Kurt McKenzie, a friend of Lenny who is a stay-at-home dad.\n** Jameel McGill as Young Kurt McKenzie\n* [[David Spade]] as Marcus Higgins, a friend of Lenny who is a [[slacker]] and [[lothario]].\n** Kyle Brooks as Young Marcus Higgins\n* [[Rob Schneider]] as Rob Hilliard, a hippie friend of Lenny who has been through three marriages with women nicknamed \"The Eater\", \"The Cheater\", and \u201cThe Beater\" and also wears a toupee that extends his hairstyle.\n** Joshua Matz as Young Rob Hilliard\n* [[Salma Hayek]] as Roxanne Chase-Feder, a fashion designer and the wife of Lenny.\n* [[Maria Bello]] as Sally Lamonsoff, the wife of Eric.\n* [[Maya Rudolph]] as Deanne McKenzie, the wife of Kurt.\n* [[Joyce Van Patten]] as Gloria Noonan, an older woman who is Rob's fourth wife.\n* Ebony Jo-Ann as Mama Ronzoni, the mother of Deanne and the mother-in-law of Kurt who has a poor relationship with Kurt.\n* Di Quon as Rita, an Asian [[nanny]] who works for Lenny and Roxanne and whom Lenny passes off as an exchange student in front of his friends.\n* [[Colin Quinn]] as Dickie Bailey, a restaurant chef at \"Woodman's Eat in the Rough\" who is Lenny's childhood rival.\n** Hunter Silva as Young Dickie Bailey\n* [[Steve Buscemi]] as Wiley, one of Dickie's friends.\n* [[Tim Meadows]] as Malcolm, one of Dickie's friends who is a rival of Kurt.
