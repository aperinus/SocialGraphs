The play was, in turn, adapted from a [[The Teahouse of the August Moon (novel)|1951 novel]] by [[Vern Sneider|Vern J.

His commanding officer, Colonel Wainwright Purdy III ([[Paul Ford]]), assigns him a wily local, Sakini ([[Marlon Brando]]), as interpreter.\n\nFisby tries to implement the military's plans by encouraging the villagers to build a school in the shape of a pentagon, but they want to build a [[Ochaya|teahouse]] instead. Fisby gradually becomes assimilated to the local customs and mores with the help of Sakini and Lotus Blossom, a young [[geisha]] ([[Machiko Ky\u014d]]).\n\nTo revive the economy, he has the Okinawans manufacture small items to sell as souvenirs, but nobody wants to buy them. These include cricket cages and wooden Japanese footwear called [[Geta (footwear)|geta]]. Then Fisby makes a happy discovery. The villagers distill a potent sweet potato brandy in a matter of days which finds a ready market in the American army. With the influx of money, the teahouse is built in next to no time.\n\nWhen Purdy sends psychiatrist Captain McLean ([[Eddie Albert]]) to check up on Fisby, the newcomer is quickly won over. This, even after Fisby greets McLean wearing [[Geta (footwear)|geta]], an army bathrobe (which Fisby claims is his [[kimono]]) and what Fisby terms an \"air-conditioned\" straw hat (the latter being headwear worn by Okinawan farmers). McLean later proves to be enthusiastic about [[organic farming]].\n\nWhen Purdy doesn't hear from either officer, he shows up in person and surprises Fisby and McLean, the latter wearing a [[yukata]] (summer-weight kimono). They are leading a rowdy song at a party in full swing in the teahouse. Purdy orders the building and distillery destroyed. In a burst of foresight, the villagers break up old water urns rather than the brandy storage and only dismantle the teahouse, hiding the sections.\n\nThe village is chosen by the Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers ([[Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers|SCAP]]) as an example of successful American-led democratization. This leads to Colonel Purdy's regretting his actions and to reassembling the teahouse.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Marlon Brando]] as Sakini\n* [[Glenn Ford]] as Captain Fisby\n* [[Machiko Ky\u014d]] as Lotus Blossom\n* [[Eddie Albert]] as Captain McLean\n* [[Paul Ford]] as Colonel Wainwright Purdy III\n* [[Jun Negami]] as Mr. Seiko\n* Nijiko Kiyokawa as Miss Higa Jiga\n* Mitsuko Sawamura as Little Girl\n* [[Henry (Harry) Morgan]] as Sergeant Gregovich\n\n==Production==\nPlaying the role of an Okinawan villager was to prove an interesting challenge for [[Marlon Brando]]'s [[method acting]] techniques. He spent two months studying local culture, speech, and gestures and, for the actual shooting, spent two hours daily having make-up applied to make him appear Asian.<ref>{{citation | first = Tony | last = Thomas | title = The Films of Marlon Brando | page = 97}}</ref>\n\nThe role of Colonel Wainwright Purdy III was to have been played by [[Louis Calhern]], but he died of a sudden [[heart attack]] in [[Nara, Nara|Nara]] early in production and was replaced by Paul Ford.<ref>{{citation | url = https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0049830/trivia | title = trivia | publisher = IMDb}}</ref> Ford had played the part more than a thousand times on Broadway, having been an original cast member, and he would play a similarly bumbling, harassed colonel  in [[Phil Silvers]]' TV series ''[[The Phil Silvers Show|Bilko]]''.\n\nFord was not the only actor who went on to be cast in a television series role very similar to his ''Teahouse'' character. Like the psychiatrist Captain McLean, Eddie Albert's \"[[Oliver Wendell Douglas]]\" on ''[[Green Acres]]'' (1965-1971) was a licensed professional with an advanced degree, who obsessed about the glory of farming and yearned to give up his practice in favor of tending the soil.\n\nThe film made use of Japanese music recorded in [[Kyoto]] and sung and danced by Japanese artists. [[Machiko Ky\u014d]] (Lotus Blossom) had won acclaim for her dramatic performances in ''[[Rashomon (film)|Rashomon]]'' and ''[[Gate of Hell (film)|Gate of Hell]]'', so this lightly comedic part was a departure for her.<ref>{{citation | first = Tony | last = Thomas | title = The Films of Marlon Brando | page = 100}}</ref>\n\n== Home Media ==\nIn November 7, 2006, was released in DVD by [[Warner Bros.
