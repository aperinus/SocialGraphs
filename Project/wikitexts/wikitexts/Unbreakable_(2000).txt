Night Shyamalan]], and starring [[Bruce Willis]], [[Samuel L. Jackson]], [[Robin Wright]], [[Spencer Treat Clark]], and [[Charlayne Woodard]]. It is the first installment in the [[Unbreakable (film series)|''Unbreakable'' film series]]. In ''Unbreakable'', [[David Dunn (character)|David Dunn]] (Willis) survives a train crash with no injuries, leading to the realization that he harbors superhuman abilities. As he begins to grapple with this discovery, he comes to the attention of disabled comic book store owner Elijah Price (Jackson), who manipulates David in order to understand him.\n\nShyamalan organized the narrative of ''Unbreakable'' to parallel a comic book's traditional [[Three-act structure|three-part story structure]]. After settling on the [[origin story]], Shyamalan wrote the screenplay as a [[speculative screenplay]] with Willis already set to star in the film and Jackson in mind to portray Elijah Price. Filming began in April 2000 and was completed in July.\n\n''Unbreakable'' was released on November 21, 2000. It received generally positive reviews,<ref name=\"metacritic\" /> praise for Shyamalan's direction, screenplay, its aesthetics, the performances, the emotional weight of the story, cinematography, and the score by [[James Newton Howard]]. The film has subsequently gained a strong [[cult following]].<ref>{{cite magazine | title = Unbreakable \u2013 An Oral History | url = https://www.ew.com/article/2015/07/10/unbreakable-oral-history | magazine = [[Entertainment Weekly]] | date = July 10, 2015 | access-date = October 14, 2015}}</ref> A realistic vision of the [[superhero]] genre,<ref name=\"hollywoodreporter\"/> it is regarded by many as one of Shyamalan's best films and one of the best [[superhero film]]s.

As his son Joseph watches news coverage of a train crash, he realizes that it's the train David was on. David wakes up at the hospital, everyone shocked that he survived, uninjured.\n\nAfter a memorial service for the victims, David finds a note on his car windshield asking how long he has been ill and inviting him to \"Limited Edition\", an art gallery operated by comic book expert, Elijah Price. David realizes that he has indeed never been ill, with a single exception, and goes with Joseph to meet Elijah, who suffers from [[osteogenesis imperfecta|brittle bone disease]]. Elijah explains his theory that his own physical frailty must be matched by someone on the other end of the spectrum who cannot be \"broken\".  David is unsettled and leaves when Elijah admits that he believes superheroes are real, but later finds he can bench press 350 pounds, well above his expectations. Joseph idolizes his father, believing him to be a superhero, although David maintains that he is an ordinary man.\n\nDavid challenges Elijah's theory with an incident from his childhood when he almost drowned later and contracted pneumonia. Elijah suggests that this is merely his weakness, as David recalls the car accident that ended his athletic career, in which he had been unharmed and ripped off the car door with his bare hands to rescue his girlfriend, Audrey. He feigned injury from the crash to quit football because Audrey disliked the violence of the sport.\n\nUnder Elijah's influence, David realizes that his \"intuition\" for picking out dangerous people during security checks is actually [[extrasensory perception]]. Consciously honing this ability, David discovers that touch contact with people brings him visions of criminal acts they have committed. As people bump into him in a crowd, he senses the crimes they have perpetrated such as theft, assault, and rape. He finds one criminal he can confront: a sadistic janitor who has invaded a family home, killed the father, and is now holding his wife and two children captive. David, wearing a raincoat as a disguise, follows the janitor to the victims' house and frees the children. The janitor pushes him into a swimming pool where he nearly drowns, but is rescued by the children. David strangles the janitor to death, but not before the janitor kills the mother. The next morning, David shows Joseph a newspaper article featuring a sketch of the anonymous hero, whom Joseph recognizes as his father, and he tearfully promises to keep his secret.\n\nDavid meets Elijah's elderly mother, who explains the difference between villains who fight heroes with physical strength and those who use their intelligence. Elijah asks David to shake his hand to celebrate his rescue, which reveals that Elijah was responsible for numerous high-profile \"accidents,\u201d including David's train crash, in an effort to find someone who fits his idea of a superhero. An emotional Elijah tells a horrified David, \"Now that we know who you are, I know who I am\", indicating that he sees himself as an archvillain and David's nemesis. He adopts his childhood nickname, \"Mr. Glass,\" as his [[supervillain]] moniker. David reports Elijah's crimes to the police, and Elijah is confined to a psychiatric hospital for the criminally insane.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Bruce Willis]] as [[David Dunn (character)|David Dunn]], a former football player with superhuman strength who sees the crimes of those whom he touches \n** Davis Duffield as 20-year-old David\n* [[Samuel L.

Night Shyamalan]] conceived the idea for ''Unbreakable'', the outline had a comic book's traditional three-part structure (the [[superhero]]'s \"birth\", his struggles against general evil-doers, and the hero's ultimate battle against the \"[[archenemy]]\"). Finding the birth section most interesting, he decided to write ''Unbreakable'' as an [[origin story]].

Various visual [[motif (narrative)|narrative motif]]s were also applied. Several scenes relating to the Mr. Glass character involve glass. As a newborn, he is primarily seen reflected in mirrors, and as a young child, he is seen reflected in a blank TV screen. When he leaves his calling card on the windshield of David Dunn's car, he is reflected in a glass frame in his art gallery. Jackson requested his walking stick be made of glass to make his character more menacing. Using purple as Mr. Glass' color to David Dunn's green was also Jackson's idea.<ref>Unrelated to this film, Jackson asked [[George Lucas]] for a purple [[lightsaber]] in ''[[Star Wars: Episode II \u2013 Attack of the Clones]]''. \"Samuel L.
