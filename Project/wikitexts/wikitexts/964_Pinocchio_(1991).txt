It deals with the theme of brain-modified sex slaves as well as [[mental breakdown]]s in a hallucinogenic thrill ride.\n\n==Plot==\n964 Pinocchio is a memory-wiped [[sex slave]] [[cyborg]] who is thrown out by his owners for failure to maintain an erection. It is unclear in what ways he has been modified beyond having no memory and being unable to communicate. He is discovered by Himiko, a homeless girl, while wandering aimlessly through the city. Himiko has also been memory-wiped, possibly by the same company that produced Pinocchio, but she is fully functional. Himiko spends her days drawing maps of the city, to aid other memory-wiped people.\n\nHimiko takes Pinocchio home and tries to teach him to speak. After much effort he has a breakthrough and finally becomes aware of his situation. At this point his body erupts in an inexplicable [[metamorphosis]] and it becomes clear that his modifications were much more involved and [[esoteric]] than simple memory loss. Himiko also begins to transform, though in a much more subtle manner.\n\n==Release==\n[[Unearthed Films]] released the film on DVD in the United States in 2007.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dvdempire.com/Exec/v4_item.asp?item_id=626245|title=964 Pinocchio|publisher=dvdempire.com|access-date=2011-04-08}}</ref>  The film was released in a single edition DVD and in the ''Cyberpunk Collection'' alongside Fukui's ''[[Rubber's Lover]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dvdempire.com/Exec/v4_item.asp?item_id=1368470|title=Cyberpunk Collection (2 Pack)|publisher=dvdempire.com|access-date=2011-04-08}}</ref> Both releases are currently [[out of print]].\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|0225009|964 Pinocchio}}\n* {{Rotten Tomatoes|pinocchio_964}}\n* [http://www.horrordrome.com/movie/964-pinocchio-1991 964 Pinocchio] at Horrordrome\n* {{cite web |url=http://www.jmdb.ne.jp/1991/do001940.htm|title=\u30d4\u30ce\u30ad\u30aa \uff3b\u30eb\u30fc\u30c8\uff3d\uff19\uff16\uff14 (''Pinokio\uff3bRuuto\uff3d 964'')|access-date=2007-07-19|language=ja|publisher=[[Japanese Movie Database]]| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20070830083912/http://www.jmdb.ne.jp/1991/do001940.htm| archive-date= 30 August 2007 | url-status= live}}\n\n[[Category:1991 films]]\n[[Category:1991 horror films]]\n[[Category:1991 science fiction films]]\n[[Category:1990s science fiction horror films]]\n[[Category:Cyberpunk films]]\n[[Category:Cyborg films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Shozin Fukui]]\n[[Category:Films set in the future]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Tokyo]]\n[[Category:1990s Japanese-language films]]\n[[Category:Japanese science fiction horror films]]\n[[Category:1990s Japanese films]]\n\n\n{{sf-horror-film-stub}}\n{{1990s-Japan-film-stub}}"}]}}}}
