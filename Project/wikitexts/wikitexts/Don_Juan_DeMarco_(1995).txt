Clad in a cape and [[domino mask]], DeMarco undergoes psychiatric treatment with [[Marlon Brando]]'s character, Dr. Jack Mickler, to cure him of his apparent delusion. But the psychiatric sessions have an unexpected effect on the psychiatric staff, some of whom find themselves inspired by DeMarco's delusion; the most profoundly affected is Dr. Mickler himself, who rekindles the romance in his complacent marriage.\n\nThe movie is based on two different sources; the modern-day story is based on director/screenwriter [[Jeremy Leven]]'s short story ''Don Juan DeMarco and the Centerfold'' (the movie's original title before the studio changed it shortly before release), while the flashbacks depicting DeMarco's back-story are based on the more familiar legend of Don Juan, especially as told by [[Lord Byron]] in his [[Don Juan (Byron)|version of the legend]].\n\nDepp received the [[London Film Critics Circle Award for Actor of the Year]], along with his performance in ''[[Ed Wood (film)|Ed Wood]]'' while the film's theme song, \"[[Have You Ever Really Loved a Woman?]]\", co-written and performed by [[Bryan Adams]], was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Song|Oscar]], [[Grammy Award for Best Song Written for Visual Media|Grammy]], and [[Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song]].\n\n==Plot==\nJohn Arnold DeMarco is a 21-year-old man who dresses like [[Zorro]], with a similar mask, hat and cape and claims to be [[Don Juan]]. After a passionate affair, he decides to commit suicide. At the site of the billboard he plans to jump off of, psychiatrist Jack Mickler dissuades him by posing as Don Octavio de Flores. John is then held for a ten-day review in a [[mental institution]].\n\nMickler, who is about to retire, insists on doing the evaluation and conducts it without medicating the youth. Mickler listens to John's story continuing to pose as Don Octavio: Don Juan was born in [[Mexico]], he has an affair with his school tutor which ultimately leads to the death of his father in a swordfight. Mickler listens to the story while spotting inconsistencies, such as the Castilian nature of John's accent, but continues to humor him.\n\nAt home, Mickler is living in a passionless marriage to his wife, Marilyn. As Mickler notices that John's presence at the institution is having an impact on the staff - both distracting the women and dancing with a male attendant on the lawn - he finds himself being influenced, and starts listening to opera in his house and rekindling the passion with his wife.\n\nEventually Mickler meets with John's grandmother, who tells him that John grew up in Phoenix, Arizona, and that his father died in a car crash. When Mickler returns to the institution and confronts his patient with this information, John dismisses his grandmother as misanthropic and of making the backstory up. In response Mickler recounts the story of an insecure young man who fell in love with a woman in a magazine, who then contacted her and was told she never wanted to speak to him again. When John asks what happened to the young man, Mickler tells him he tried to commit suicide.\n\nAs the ten days tick down, and pressure mounts on Mickler to support the youth's indefinite confinement, a decision which he is skeptical of. John has mentioned that his mother became a nun and remains in the convent to this day, and in a subsequent meeting with John, Mickler suggests that John's mother could have possibly had affairs, to which John responds with violent anger.\n\nJohn concludes his story, about how he was kept two years in a harem as the lover of the sultaness, before finding true love and being rejected on a remote Greek island by his one true love, Do\u00f1a Ana. Mickler tells him at the story's end that he believes John is Don Juan DeMarco, the greatest lover the world has ever known. When John asks Mickler who he is, he says \"I am Don Octavio de Flores\" and that John has seen through all of his masks.\n\nAt the end of the ten days, Mickler is able to convince John to take his medication, and makes him understand that not everyone believes he is Don Juan. Right before his retirement, Mickler and John meet with the board, with John in street clothes. He speaks with an American accent, and acknowledges that he was born in Queens, his father was killed in an accident, and that his mother was unfaithful to his father. John is released and accompanies Mickler, along with the doctor's wife, to the remote island that Don Juan has described where he met his true love.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Marlon Brando]] as Dr. Jack Mickler/Don Octavio de Flores\n* [[Johnny Depp]] as John Arnold DeMarco/[[Don Juan]]\n* [[Faye Dunaway]] as Marilyn Mickler\n* [[Rachel Ticotin]] as Do\u00f1a Inez\n* [[Bob Dishy]] as Dr. Paul Showalter\n* [[G\u00e9raldine Pailhas]] as Do\u00f1a Ana\n* [[Talisa Soto]] as Do\u00f1a Julia\n* [[Marita Geraghty]] as Woman in Restaurant\n* [[Richard C.
