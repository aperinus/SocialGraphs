It stars [[Diane Keaton]], [[Jessica Lange]], [[Sissy Spacek]], [[Sam Shepard]], [[Tess Harper]], and [[Hurd Hatfield]]. The film's narrative follows the Magrath sisters, Babe, Lenny and Meg, who reunite in their family home in Mississippi to regroup and settle their past. Each sister is forced to face the consequences of the \"crimes of the heart\" she has committed.\n\n''Crimes Of The Heart'' was theatrically released by  [[De Laurentiis Entertainment Group]] on December 12, 1986. It received positive reviews with critics praising its screenplay and performances (most notably Spacek's), but was a box office disappointment; grossing $22.9 million on a $20 million budget. The film received three nominations at the [[59th Academy Awards]]; [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]] (for Spacek), [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]] (for Harper), and [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Adapted Screenplay]]. At the [[44th Golden Globe Awards]], it received a nomination for the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture \u2013 Musical or Comedy|Best Motion Picture \u2013 Musical or Comedy]], with Spacek winning [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress \u2013 Motion Picture Comedy or Musical|Best Actress]].\n\n==Plot==\nThe story focuses on the Magrath sisters\u2014Lenny, Meg, and Babe\u2014who reunite at the family home in [[Hazlehurst, Mississippi]], after Babe shoots her abusive husband. The three were raised by Old Granddaddy after their mother hanged herself and the family cat and have been eccentric ever since. Lenny is a [[Wallflower (people)|wallflower]] who bemoans her shriveled [[ovary]]. [[Egocentrism|Egocentric]] Meg is a singer whose Hollywood career ended abruptly when she suffered a nervous breakdown. Unruly and impulsive Babe shocks her sisters with stories about her affair with a teenage African American boy. Past resentments bubble to the surface as the women are forced to deal with assorted relatives and previous relationships while coping with the latest incident that has disrupted their [[Dysfunctional family|dysfunctional]] lives.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast list|\n* [[Diane Keaton]] as Lenny Magrath\n* [[Jessica Lange]] as Meg Magrath\n* [[Sissy Spacek]] as Rebecca Magrath/Babe Botrelle\n* [[Sam Shepard]] as Doc Porter\n* [[Tess Harper]] as Chick Boyle\n* David Carpenter as Barnette Lloyd\n* [[Hurd Hatfield]] as Old Granddaddy\n* [[Beeson Carroll]] as Zackery Botrelle\n* [[Jean Willard]] as Lucille Botrelle\n* [[Tom Mason (actor, born 1949)|Tom Mason]] as Uncle Watson\n* [[Gregory Travis]] as Willie Jay\n* [[Annie McKnight]] as Annie May Jenkis\n* [[Eleanor Eagle]] as Little Lenny\n* [[Jessica Ezzell]] as Little Meg\n* [[Natalie Anderson (American actress)|Natalie Anderson]] as Little Babe\n* [[Connie Adams]] as Zackery's concubine\n* [[Robert J.

[[Roger Ebert]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' called the film \"that most delicate of undertakings: a comedy about serious matters. It exists somewhere between parody and melodrama, between the tragic and the goofy. There are moments when the movie doesn't seem to know where it's going, but for once that's a good thing because the uncertainty almost always ends with some kind of a delightful, weird surprise. The underlying tone ... is a deep, abiding comic affection, a love for these characters who survive in the middle of a thicket of Southern Gothic clich\u00e9s and archetypes.\"<ref>{{cite web | first=Roger | last=Ebert | url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/crimes-of-the-heart-1986 | title=Crimes of the Heart | website=RogerEbert.com | publisher=Ebert Digital LLC | date=December 12, 1986 | access-date=May 1, 2018}}</ref>\n\nRita Kempley of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' described it as \"''[[Hannah and Her Sisters]]'' with a southern accent, a lilting gingerbread gothic with Diane Keaton, Sissy Spacek and Jessica Lange ding-a-linging harmoniously as [[Dixie]]land belles\" and added, \"Playwright Beth Henley has no dire message for us, but her adaptation is nicely restructured, glib as all get-out and character-wise ... The powerhouse performances are directed by Bruce Beresford, who maintains balance among the actresses and keeps a lovely tone and smooth pace. As with his critically acclaimed ''[[Tender Mercies]]'', the Australian director again looks at American types with a fresh eye.\"<ref>{{cite web | first=Rita | last=Kempley | title='Crimes of the Heart' | work=The Washington Post | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/style/longterm/movies/videos/crimesoftheheartpg13kempley_a0cacf.htm | date=December 12, 1986 | access-date=May 1, 2018}}</ref>\n\n''Crimes of the Heart'' currently holds an 81% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on twenty-one reviews.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/crimes_of_the_heart|title = Crimes of the Heart|website = [[Rotten Tomatoes]]}}</ref>\n\n===Accolades===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n!
