Both Gleeson and Cheadle received acclaim for their performances, with Gleeson receiving a  [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor - Motion Picture Musical or Comedy|Golden Globe Award]] nomination. McDonagh was in turn nominated for a [[BAFTA Award for Best Original Screenplay|BAFTA Award]] for his writing achievement.

He is crass and confrontational, regularly indulging in drugs and alcohol even while on duty. He is also shown to have a softer side, showing concern for his ailing mother, Eileen.\n\nBoyle and his new subordinate, Aidan McBride, investigate a murder, with evidence apparently pointing to an occult serial killer. Shortly after, Boyle attends a briefing by an American [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) agent Wendell Everett, sent to liaise with the Garda in hunting four Irish drug traffickers led by Francis Sheehy-Skeffington, who is believed to be awaiting a massive seaborne delivery of cocaine from Jamaica. Boyle recognises one of the men in Everett's presentation as the victim of the murder he and McBride had been investigating. McBride pulls over a car driven by Sheehy and his lieutenants Clive Cornell and Liam O'Leary and is shot dead. McBride's wife, Gabriela, reports McBride's disappearance to Boyle, who promises to look into it.\n\nThe strait-laced Everett suggests that he and the unorthodox Boyle team up to track down Sheehy and his men. Everett makes the rounds, encountering [[Irish-language|Irish-speaking]] residents who pretend not to understand English rather than deal with an outsider.\n. Boyle has a sexual encounter with a pair of prostitutes at a hotel in town. On his way back from the hotel, Boyle spots McBride's Garda car at a \"suicide hotspot\" along the coast but does not believe that McBride killed himself. McBride's wife, Gabriela, an immigrant from Croatia, reports him missing and tells Boyle that McBride is gay and that she married him to obtain an Irish visa as well as to make McBride \"look respectable\".<ref>[http://transcripts.thedealr.net/script.php/the-guard-2011-6Ser The Guard (2011) Script]</ref><ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=-nBBAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA24 Leen Engelen, Kris Van Heuckelom.

P. 24]</ref>\n\nMeeting Everett at a local [[Irish pub|pub]], Boyle notices a [[Closed-circuit television]] (CCTV) camera and remembers that the original suspect in the murder case claimed to be frequenting it at the time of the killing. Looking over the footage from the time of the murder, they see that the suspect's alibi is valid \u2013 and Everett also spots Sheehy and Cornell at the pub. Cornell delivers a payoff to the Garda inspectors to keep them off the case but Sheehy believes that Boyle will not be so easily swayed, after he meets with Boyle to half-heartedly attempt blackmail and then to offer a bribe, which is refused. Tipped off by a young boy named Eugene, Boyle discovers a cache of weapons hidden in the bog by the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army]] (IRA) and says he will arrange its return. (It is later revealed that Boyle kept a few of the guns.) Shortly after having her last wish to hear a live pub band fulfilled, Boyle's mother commits suicide by overdosing on pills.\n\nMeeting at the bar again, Everett tells Boyle that Garda sources indicate Sheehy's shipment will be coming into [[County Cork]] and that he is leaving to investigate. Returning home, Boyle is confronted in his living room by O'Leary. Boyle pulls a Derringer (from the IRA cache) and kills O'Leary, then calls Everett to tell him that the Cork lead is a decoy arranged by corrupt officers. Boyle drives to the local dock where Sheehy's vessel is berthed and Sheehy's men are unloading the cocaine. Everett arrives and Boyle hands him an automatic rifle and persuades him to provide covering fire as he moves to arrest Sheehy and Cornell. Boyle kills Cornell before leaping onto the boat to deal with Sheehy. Everett's gunfire sets the boat alight. Boyle shoots Sheehy and leaves him for dead in the main cabin as the boat explodes.\n\nThe next day, Everett looks out on the water where the boat sank, believing Boyle to be dead. Eugene, standing nearby, mentions that Boyle was a good swimmer, having placed fourth at the [[1988 Summer Olympics]], a claim that Everett had dismissed. A young photographer comments that it would be easy enough to look up to verify as true. Everett remembers Boyle's remark that Sheehy's backers would not forget Boyle's actions and that Boyle would have to disappear were he to continue living, and smiles.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Brendan Gleeson]] as Sergeant Gerry Boyle\n* [[Don Cheadle]] as FBI Agent Wendell Everett\n* [[Mark Strong]] as Clive Cornell\n* [[Liam Cunningham]] as Francis Sheehy-Skeffington\n* [[Fionnula Flanagan]] as Eileen Boyle\n* M\u00edche\u00e1l \u00d3g Lane as Eugene Moloney\n* [[David Wilmot (actor)|David Wilmot]] as Liam O'Leary\n* [[Sarah Greene (actress)|Sarah Greene]] as Sin\u00e9ad Mulligan\n* Darren Healy as Jimmy Moody\n* [[Rory Keenan]] as Garda Aidan McBride\n* [[Dominique McElligott]] as Aoife O'Carroll\n* [[Katarina \u010cas]] as Gabriela McBride\n* [[Dermot Healy]] as old farmer\n* [[Pat Shortt]] as Colum Hennessy\n* [[Laurence Kinlan]] as young photographer\n* [[Wale Ojo]] as Doctor Oleyuwo<ref>{{cite web |title=The Guard (2011) - IMDb |website=[[IMDb]] |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1540133/fullcredits |access-date=22 March 2021}}</ref>\n}}\n\n==Production==\n\n===Development===\nFilm producers include Chris Clark, Flora Fernandez-Marengo, Ed Guiney and Andrew Lowe, with [[executive producers]] Paul Brett, [[Don Cheadle]], [[Martin McDonagh]] (brother of John Michael), David Nash, Ralph Kamp, Lenore Zerman and associate producer [[Elizabeth Eves]].<ref name=\"IFTN1\"/> Director John Michael McDonagh is known for his screenplay for the 2003 film ''[[Ned Kelly (2003 film)|Ned Kelly]]'' and as writer/director of the 2000 film ''The Second Death''.<ref name=\"IFTN1\"/> [[Cinematographer]] [[Larry Smith (cinematographer)|Larry Smith]] is known for his work on ''[[Eyes Wide Shut]]'' and [[production designer]] [[John-Paul Kelly (production designer)|John-Paul Kelly]] for his work on ''[[Venus (2006 film)|Venus]]''.<ref name=\"IFTN1\"/><ref name=\"S1\"/><ref name=\"BP1\"/>\n\n===Filming===\nPrincipal filming began on 29 October 2009, in [[Lettermore]] [[County Galway]].
