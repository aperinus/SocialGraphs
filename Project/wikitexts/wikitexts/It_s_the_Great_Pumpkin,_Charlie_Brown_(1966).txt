''It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown: The Making of a Television Classic'' includes the entire script, never-before-seen photographs, [[storyboard]] excerpts, and interviews with the original [[child actor]]s who provided the voices of the ''Peanuts'' gang.\n\nA history of the program and the various religious interpretations of Linus' sincere belief in the Great Pumpkin are explained in the 2015 book, ''A Charlie Brown Religion,'' published by the [[University Press of Mississippi]].<ref>Lind, Stephen (2015). A Charlie Brown Religion (Jackson: University Press of Mississippi).</ref>\n\n==Plot summary==\nAs Halloween approaches, [[Linus van Pelt|Linus]] and [[Lucy Van Pelt]] go out to the local pumpkin patch to find a pumpkin until Lucy selects the largest they can find; she makes Linus carry it back to the house. He becomes upset when Lucy starts cutting it to make a [[jack-o-lantern]]. Later, Snoopy helps Charlie Brown finish raking a pile of leaves. Linus jumps into the heap with a large [[lollipop]], resulting in leaves sticking to his face and lollipop. Then Lucy entices Charlie Brown to kick her football by showing him a signed agreement, but then pulls it away as usual before pointing out the agreement never got [[Notary public|notarized]].\n\nLinus is writing his yearly letter to the [[Great Pumpkin]]. As he does so, he suffers from Snoopy's laughter, Lucy's threats, Patty's claim he's wasting his time, and Charlie Brown's initial disbelief of him and later outrage of him dragging [[Sally Brown|Sally]], his little sister, into it (the only one who, because she's so smitten with him, supports him). Lucy follows Linus as he goes out to mail the letter, refusing to even help him and thus, leaving him to use his blanket to open the mailbox and let the letter float in. Charlie Brown shows up to announce that he was invited to a Halloween party hosted by Violet. Lucy is skeptical about his invitation, assuming it was sent by mistake.\n\nOn Halloween night, the group goes [[trick-or-treating]], with each wearing a costume. Most dress as ghosts in simple white sheet costumes; Charlie Brown has \"trouble with the scissors,\" leaving his costume full of holes. [[Pig-Pen (Peanuts)|Pig-Pen's]] trademark dust cloud makes him easy to identify. Lucy dresses as a witch, claiming it represents the opposite of her real personality. On the way, they stop at the pumpkin patch to jeer at Linus for missing the festivities as usual. Undeterred, Linus persuades Sally, due to her infatuation with him, to skip trick-or-treating and join him.\n\nThe \"tricks or treats\" group receives various sweets and some money, except for Charlie Brown, who is given nothing except rocks. After going back to the pumpkin patch to tease Linus and Sally again, they go to Violet's Halloween party. The girls ask Charlie Brown to serve as their model, initially to his delight, then embarrassment, when they use the back of his head to canvas potential jack-o'-lantern designs. Meanwhile, Snoopy, wearing his [[World War I]] [[flying ace]] costume, climbs aboard his doghouse and imagines it is a [[Sopwith Camel]] fighter plane. After a fierce battle with the unseen [[Manfred von Richthofen|Red Baron]], Snoopy makes his way across \"[[Western Front (World War I)|the countryside]]\" to crash the Halloween party. Sneaking into an apple bobbing tank, he accidentally kisses Lucy when she picks up an apple, disgusting her. He is entertained by [[Schroeder (Peanuts)|Schroeder]] playing of World War I tunes on his piano, but when the sad songs make him cry, he leaves.\n\nLinus and Sally are still in the pumpkin patch when Linus sees a mysterious shadowy figure, which turns out to be Snoopy, rising from the moonlit patch. Linus mistakes Snoopy for the Great Pumpkin, and faints. When Linus wakes, Sally furiously yells at him for making her miss the Halloween festivities, even as Charlie Brown and the others come to take her home. As they leave Linus, still adamant that the Great Pumpkin will materialize, promises to put in a good word for them if it comes and then panics after realizing that he said ''if'' instead of ''when''.\n\nAt 4 a.m., Lucy wakes up to find that Linus is not in bed and goes outside. She finds her brother in the pumpkin patch, covered by his blanket, shivering and half asleep. She leads him into the house, takes off his shoes, and puts him to bed.\n\nThe next morning, Charlie Brown and Linus lean against a brick wall and commiserate about the previous night. Charlie Brown attempts to console Linus by explaining that he has done many stupid things too. Hearing that makes Linus snap, and he vows that the Great Pumpkin will come to the pumpkin patch next year; Charlie Brown dejectedly listens to Linus\u2019 ranting while credits roll.\n\n==Voice actors==\n*[[Peter Robbins (actor)|Peter Robbins]] as [[Charlie Brown]]\n*Christopher Shea as [[Linus van Pelt]]\n*Kathy Steinberg as [[Sally Brown]]\n*[[Bill Melendez]] as [[Snoopy]]\n*[[Sally Dryer]] as [[Lucy van Pelt]]\n*Gabrielle DeFaria as [[Pig-Pen (Peanuts)|\"Pig-Pen\"]]\n*Glenn Mendelson as [[Schroeder (Peanuts)|Schroeder]]/[[Shermy]]\n*Ann Altieri as [[Violet (Peanuts)|Violet]]/[[Frieda (Peanuts)|Frieda]]\n*Lisa DeFaria as [[Patty (Peanuts)|Patty]]\n\n==Viewer response==\n\nSchulz did not wish to make Charlie Brown's response of \"I got a rock\" a running gag.

Guaraldi historian and author Derrick Bang commented that the music Guaraldi composed for the special \"emphatically established the ''Peanuts'' 'musical personality',\" adding that the version of \"Linus and Lucy\" featured during the cold open was \"arguably the best arrangement\u2026that Guaraldi ever laid down, thanks in great part to [[Ronnie Lang|Ronald Lang]]'s flute counterpoint.\" (This version was again utilized in the 1969 feature film ''[[A Boy Named Charlie Brown]]''.)<ref name=Bang>{{cite web |url= http://www.fivecentsplease.org/dpb/vincecd.html |title= Vince Guaraldi on LP and CD: ''It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown: Music from the Soundtrack'' |last= Bang |first=Derrick |website= fivecentsplease.org |publisher= Derrick Bang, Scott McGuire  |access-date= February 25, 2020 }}</ref>\n\n[[Craft Recordings]] released the [[It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown: Original Soundtrack Recording|complete soundtrack album]] from the special on October 12, 2018.
