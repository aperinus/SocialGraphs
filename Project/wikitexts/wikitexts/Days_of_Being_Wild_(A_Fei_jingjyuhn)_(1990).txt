Starring some of the best-known actors and actresses in Hong Kong, including [[Leslie Cheung]], [[Andy Lau]], [[Maggie Cheung]], [[Carina Lau]], [[Jacky Cheung]] and [[Tony Leung Chiu-wai|Tony Leung]], the film marks the first collaboration between Wong and cinematographer [[Christopher Doyle]], with whom he has since made six more films.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.calendarlive.com/movies/reviews/cl-et-wild7jan07,2,1023366.story |title=Days of Being Wild |work=Los Angeles Times|author=Kevin Crust |date=7 January 2005 }}</ref><ref name=\"elegraph\">{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/3634160/What-cinemas-movers-and-shakers-say-about-Wong-Kar-Wai-I-may-never-come-back-from-Shanghai.html |title=What cinema's movers and shakers say about Wong Kar-Wai I may never come back from Shanghai? |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=UK |date=31 December 2004 }}</ref>\n\nIt forms the first part of an informal [[trilogy]], together with ''[[In the Mood for Love]]'' (2000) and ''[[2046 (film)|2046]]'' (2004).<ref name=\"elegraph\" />\n\n==Plot==\nThe movie begins in 1960 Hong Kong.\n\nYuddy, a smooth-talking playboy seduces Li-zhen but is uninterested in pursuing a serious relationship with her. Li-zhen, who wants to marry him, is heartbroken and decides to leave. Yuddy moves on to a new relationship with vivacious cabaret dancer Mimi. His friend Zeb is also attracted to her but she doesn't reciprocate his feelings.\n\nYuddy has a tense relationship with his adoptive mother, a former prostitute, after she reveals that he is adopted. He also doesn't approve of her choice of lovers much younger than her who he thinks are taking advantage of her. She initially refuses to reveal who his birth mother is but eventually relents and tells him that she lives in the Philippines.\n\nLi-zhen finds solace in Tide, a policeman who does his rounds near Yuddy's house. Tide dreams of becoming a sailor but he chooses to be a policeman to stay and look after his mother. Li-zhen talks about her failed love affair, her successful cousin's impending marriage and how she misses home. Li-zhen, who works at the ticket stall of a soccer stadium, promises Tide a free ticket to a match of his choice and Tide tells her to call him on a phone booth he passes every night if she ever needs anyone to talk to. Their near-romance is hinted at but never materializes. When his mother passes, Tide leaves to become a sailor.\n\nMeanwhile, Yuddy decides to find his birth mother and leaves for the Philippines, giving his car to Zeb and without informing Mimi. Mimi is distraught and resolves to follow him. Zeb, his love still unrequited, sells Yuddy's car to finance her trip and asks her to come back to him if she doesn't find Yuddy.\nYuddy finds his mother's house but she refuses to see him.\n\nTide, now a sailor on a stopover in the Philippines, finds a drunk Yuddy passed out on the street and brings him to his hotel room. Yuddy doesn't recognise him but accepts his assistance. He gets into a fight at the railway station over payment for an American passport and stabs a man. Tide saves him and they escape aboard a train. Tide asks him if he remembers what happened on a particular date to an exact minute, referring to something he told Li-zhen at the start of their courtship. He says that he remembers and tells him it would be best to tell Li-zhen that he doesn't. Tide returns from a conversation with the train conductor to find Yuddy shot to death.\n\nA final sequence shows Mimi having arrived in the Philippines, Li-zhen closing up at the ticket stall and a phone at the booth ringing.\n\nThe movie ends with a shot of a slick young man, smoking and readying himself in a darkened room.\n\n==Cast and roles==\n* [[Leslie Cheung]] as Yuddy ({{Lang-zh | t=\u65ed\u4ed4| s=\u65ed\u4ed4| p=X\u00f9z\u01cei| j=Juk<sup>1</sup>zai<sup>2</sup>| first=t, j}})<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y7g-mU9fX3oC&q=yuddy+tide&pg=PA28|title=Wong Kar-wai|first1=Peter|last1=Brunette|first2=Kar-wai|last2=Wong|date=22 March 2005|publisher=University of Illinois Press|isbn=9780252029929|via=Google Books}}</ref>\n* [[Andy Lau]] as Tide ({{Lang-zh | t=\u8d85\u4ed4| s=\u8d85\u4ed4| p=Ch\u0101oz\u01cei| j=Ciu<sup>1</sup>zai<sup>2</sup>| first=t, j}}), [[Hong Kong Police Force|Policeman]] 6117, who becomes a friend and confidant of Su Li-zhen and later, after the death of his mother, he becomes a sailor and goes to the [[Philippines]]\n* [[Maggie Cheung]] as Su Lizhen ({{Lang-zh | t=\u8607\u9e97\u73cd| s=\u82cf\u4e3d\u73cd| p=S\u016b L\u00eczh\u0113n| j=Sou<sup>1</sup> Lai<sup>6</sup>zan<sup>1</sup>| first=t, j}}), who grew up in [[Macau]] and is the ex-girlfriend of Yuddy\n* [[Carina Lau]] as Leung Fung-ying ({{Lang-zh | t=\u6881\u9cf3\u82f1| s=\u6881\u51e4\u82f1| p=Li\u00e1ng F\u00e8ngy\u012bng| j=Loeng<sup>4</sup> Fung<sup>6</sup>jing<sup>1</sup>| first=t, j}}), Mimi/Lulu ({{Lang-zh | t=\u54aa\u54aa| s=\u54aa\u54aa| p=M\u012bm\u012b| j=Mi<sup>1</sup>mi<sup>1</sup>| first=t, j}}), the girlfriend of Yuddy\n* [[Rebecca Pan]] as Rebecca, a former prostitute who raises Yuddy, has a love-and-hate relationship with Yuddy, because she refuses to reveal the identity of Yuddy's biological mother\n* [[Jacky Cheung]] as Zeb ({{Lang-zh | t=\u6b6a\u4ed4| s=\u6b6a\u4ed4| p=W\u0101iz\u01cei| j=Waai<sup>1</sup>zai<sup>2</sup>| first=t, j}}), Yuddy's friend since childhood; Yuddy used to live above Zeb's family's garage as a kid; Zeb fancies Mimi/Lulu\n* Danilo Antunes as Rebecca's lover, who only goes for her money\n* Hung Mei-mei as the [[Amah (occupation)|Amah]]\n* Ling Ling-hung as Nurse\n* [[Tita Mu\u00f1oz]] as Yuddy's Mother\n* [[Alicia Alonzo]] as Housekeeper\n* Elena Lim So as Hotel Manager\n* [[Maritoni Fernandez]] as Hotel Maid\n* Angela Ponos as Prostitute\n* Nonong Talbo as Train Conductor\n* [[Tony Leung Chiu-wai]] as Gambler\n\n==Music==\n* [[Los Indios Tabajaras]], \"Always in My Heart\"\n* [[Xavier Cugat]], \"Perfidia\" and \"Mar\u00eda Elena\"\n* [[Leslie Cheung]] performed the song \u4f55\u53bb\u4f55\u5f9e\u4e4b\u963f\u98db\u6b63\u50b3 loosely translated as 'Choice' or 'The True Story of Ah Fei' as the film's theme song and it is also found in his album ''[[Most Beloved|Beloved]]'' (\u5bf5\u611b).\n* \u6885\u8c54\u82b3 ([[Anita Mui]]) \u2013 \u662f\u9019\u6a23\u7684 \u2013 the [[Cantonese]] cover of the theme song and is featured at the end of the film during the credits.\n\n==Box office==\n''Days of Being Wild'' grossed HK$9,751,942 in its Hong Kong run,<ref name=\"hkfa\">{{cite web|url=http://ipac.hkfa.lcsd.gov.hk/ipac20/ipac.jsp?session=1363T4084WW31.1987&profile=hkfa&uri=full=3100024@!56463@!0&ri=6&aspect=basic_search&menu=search&source=192.168.110.61@!horizon&ipp=20&staffonly=&term=Days+of+being+wild&index=FILMBRP&uindex=&aspect=basic_search&menu=search&ri=6 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130423060324/http://ipac.hkfa.lcsd.gov.hk/ipac20/ipac.jsp?session=1363T4084WW31.1987&profile=hkfa&uri=full=3100024@!56463@!0&ri=6&aspect=basic_search&menu=search&source=192.168.110.61@!horizon&ipp=20&staffonly=&term=Days+of+being+wild&index=FILMBRP&uindex=&aspect=basic_search&menu=search&ri=6 |url-status=dead |archive-date=23 April 2013 |title=Days of being wild |publisher=[[Hong Kong Film Archive]] |access-date=11 March 2013 }}</ref> a number that would become typical for a Wong Kar Wai film.
