Directed by [[Michael Winner]], the film stars [[Charles Bronson]] as Paul Kersey, an architect who becomes a vigilante after his wife and daughter are attacked during a [[home invasion]] with his wife dying from her wounds. This was the first film in the [[Death Wish (film series)|''Death Wish'' film series]]; it was followed eight years later with ''[[Death Wish II]]'' and other similar films.\n\nAt the time of release, the film was criticized for its apparent support of vigilantism and advocating unlimited punishment of criminals.<ref name=\"rotten\">{{cite web|title = ''Death Wish'' Movie Reviews |publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]| url= https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/death_wish/| access-date = October 16, 2018}}</ref> Allegedly, the novel denounced vigilantism, whereas the film embraced the notion. The film was a commercial success and resonated with the public in the United States, which was experiencing increasing crime rates during the 1970s.<ref name=\"'70s\">{{cite book|title= How We Got Here: The '70s|last= Frum|first= David|author-link= David Frum|year= 2000|publisher= Basic Books|location= New York, New York|isbn= 0-465-04195-7|page= [https://archive.org/details/howwegothere70sd00frum/page/13 13]|url= https://archive.org/details/howwegothere70sd00frum/page/13|url-access= registration}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nPaul Kersey is a successful, middle-aged [[architect]] and family man who lives happily in [[Manhattan]] with his wife, Joanna. One day, Joanna and their grown daughter, Carol\u2014who is married to Jack Toby\u2014are followed home from [[D'Agostino Supermarkets|D'Agostino's]] by three thugs. The trio invade the Kersey apartment by posing as deliverymen. Upon finding that Carol and Joanna only have $7 on them, the thugs assault beat Joanna and rape Carol before fleeing. Upon arriving at the hospital, Paul is devastated to learn that Joanna has died from her injuries. Shortly after his wife's funeral, Paul has an encounter with a mugger in a darkened street. Paul fights back with a [[Improvised weapon#Makeshift weapons|homemade weapon]], causing the mugger to run away, while Paul is shaken and energized by the encounter.\n\nPaul's boss sends him to [[Tucson, Arizona]], to see Ames Jainchill, a client with a residential development project. A few days later, Paul is invited to dinner by Ames at his gun club. Ames is impressed with Paul's pistol marksmanship at the target range. Paul reveals that he was a [[conscientious objector]] during the [[Korean War]], when he served as a [[combat medic]]. He had been taught to handle firearms by his hunter-father, but after the senior Kersey was mortally wounded by a second hunter (who mistook Paul's father for a deer), Paul's mother made him swear never to use guns again. Paul is successful in helping Ames plan his residential housing development. Ames drives Paul back to [[Tucson International Airport|Tucson Airport]] and presents Paul with a gift for his work on the development, which he places into Paul's checked luggage.\n\nBack in Manhattan, Paul learns from Jack that Carol's mind has snapped due to the traumatic rape and her mother's death; Carol is now [[catatonia|catatonic]], and an elective mute. With Paul's blessing, Jack commits Carol to a mental hospital. Paul learns that Ames has given him a nickel-plated [[Colt Police Positive]] revolver and a box of ammunition. He loads it and takes a late-night walk during which he is mugged at gunpoint. Paul fatally shoots the mugger and, in a state of shock, runs home and vomits. The next night, Paul walks through the city looking for dangerous and violent criminals; sure enough, he kills several muggers over the next few weeks, either luring them into a confrontation by presenting himself as an affluent victim, or when he sees them attacking other innocent people.\n\n[[New York City Police Department|NYPD]] Inspector Frank Ochoa investigates the vigilante killings. His department narrows it down to a list of men who have had a family member recently killed by muggers, and/or are war veterans. Ochoa soon suspects Paul and is about to make an arrest when the [[New York County District Attorney|district attorney]] intervenes and tells Ochoa that \"we don't want him.\" The district attorney and the [[New York City Police Commissioner|police commissioner]] do not want the statistics to get out that Paul's vigilantism has led to a drastic decrease in street crime; they fear that if said information becomes public knowledge, the whole city will descend into vigilante chaos. If Paul is arrested, he will surely be labeled a [[martyr]]. Ochoa does not like the idea, but relents and opts for \"scaring him off\" instead.\n\nOne night, Paul shoots two more muggers before being wounded in the leg himself by a third. Paul pursues the mugger and corners him at a warehouse. He challenges the mugger to a [[fast draw]], Wild West-style, only to faint because of blood loss while the mugger escapes. Paul's gun is discovered by young patrolman Jackson Reilly, who hands it to Ochoa, who orders him to forget that he found it. Ochoa visits Paul at the hospital where he's recovering, and agrees to surreptitiously dispose of Paul's revolver in exchange for Paul's leaving NYC permanently. Paul takes Ochoa's deal, and his company agrees to transfer him to Chicago, while the press is informed that Paul is just another mugging victim.\n\nPaul arrives in [[Chicago Union Station]] by train. Being greeted by a company representative, he notices a group of hoodlums harassing a young woman. He excuses himself and helps the young woman. As the hoodlums make obscene gestures, Paul just smiles while making a [[finger gun]] at them.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col begin}}\n* [[Charles Bronson]] as Dr. Paul Kersey\n* [[Hope Lange]] as Joanna Kersey\n* [[Vincent Gardenia]] as Lieutenant Frank Ochoa\n* [[William Redfield (actor)|William Redfield]] as Sam Kreutzer\n* Chris Gampel as Henry Ives\n* [[Steven Keats]] as Jack Toby\n* [[Stuart Margolin]] as Ames Jainchill\n* [[Stephen Elliott (actor)|Stephen Elliott]] as Police Commissioner Dryer\n* [[Fred J.

[[Lawrence Hilton-Jacobs]], who later co-starred on the television show ''[[Welcome Back, Kotter]]'', had an uncredited role as one of the Central Park muggers near the end of the film.

[[Christopher Guest]] made one of his earliest film appearances as a young police officer who finds Kersey's gun. [[Marcia Jean Kurtz]], who played the receptionist at Paul's office, has appeared in multiple roles on the TV series ''[[Law & Order]]''. [[Sonia Manzano]], who played Maria on ''[[Sesame Street]]'', had an uncredited role as a supermarket checkout clerk. The film also marked [[Jeff Goldblum]]'s screen debut, playing one of the \"freaks\" who assaults Kersey's family early in the film.\n\n==Production==\n\n===Development===\n\nThe film was based on [[Brian Garfield]]'s [[Death Wish (novel)|1972 novel of the same name]]. Garfield was inspired to use the theme of vigilantism following incidents in his personal life. In one incident, his wife's purse was stolen; in another, his car was vandalized. His initial thought each time was that he could kill \"the son of a bitch\" responsible. He later considered that these were primitive thoughts, contemplated in an unguarded moment. He then thought of writing a novel about a man who entered that way of thinking in a moment of rage and then never emerged from it.<ref name=\"Talbot\">Talbot (2006), p. 1-31</ref> The original novel received favorable reviews but was not a bestseller. Garfield sold screen rights to both ''Death Wish'' and ''Relentless'' to the only film producers who approached him, Hal Landers and [[Bobby Roberts (film producer)|Bobby Roberts]]. He was offered the chance to write a screenplay adapting one of the two novels, and chose ''Relentless''. He simply considered it the easier of the two to turn into a film.<ref name=\"Talbot\"/> Wendell Mayes was then hired to write the screenplay for ''Death Wish''. He preserved the basic structure of the novel and much of the philosophical dialogue. It was his idea to turn police detective Frank Ochoa into a major character of the film.<ref name=\"Talbot\"/> His early drafts for the screenplay had different endings from the final one. In one, he followed an idea from Garfield. The vigilante confronts the three thugs who attacked his family and ends up dead at their hands. Ochoa discovers the dead man's weapon and considers following in his footsteps.<ref name=\"Talbot\"/> In another, the vigilante is wounded and rushed to a hospital. His fate is left ambiguous. Meanwhile, Ochoa has found the weapon and struggles with the decision to use it. His decision is left unclear.<ref name=\"Talbot\"/>\n\n===Casting===\n\nOriginally, [[Sidney Lumet]] was to have directed [[Jack Lemmon]] as Paul and [[Henry Fonda]] as Ochoa.<ref name=\"Nikki Tranter\">{{cite web|url=https://www.popmatters.com/pm/feature/historian-interview-with-brian-garfield|title=Historian: Interview with Brian Garfield|author=Nikki Tranter}}</ref> Lumet bowed out of the project to direct ''[[Serpico]]'' (1973), requiring a search for another director.<ref name=\"Talbot\"/> Several were considered, including [[Peter Medak]] who wanted Henry Fonda as Paul.<ref>p. 23 Ross, Cai ''Ghost Buster'' in ''Cinema Retro'' Vol 15 Issue #43 Winter 2019</ref> [[United Artists]] eventually chose [[Michael Winner]], due to his track record of gritty, violent action films. The examples of his work considered included ''[[The Mechanic (1972 film)|The Mechanic]]'' (1972), ''[[Scorpio (film)|Scorpio]]'' (1973), and ''[[The Stone Killer]]'' (1973).<ref name=\"Talbot\"/> The film was rejected by other studios because of its controversial subject matter and the perceived difficulty of casting someone in the vigilante role. Several actors were considered, including [[Steve McQueen]], [[Clint Eastwood]], [[Burt Lancaster]], [[George C. Scott]], [[Frank Sinatra]], [[Lee Marvin]] and even [[Elvis Presley]]. Winner attempted to recruit Bronson, but there were two problems for the actor. One was that his agent, Paul Kohner, considered that the film carried a dangerous message. The other was that the screenplay then followed the original novel in describing the vigilante as a meek accountant, hardly a suitable role for Bronson.<ref name=\"Talbot\"/> \"I was really a miscast person,\" Bronson said later. \"It was more a theme that would have been better for [[Dustin Hoffman]] or somebody who could play a weaker kind of man. I told them that at the time.\"<ref>For Bronson, Piecework Is a Virtue: Movies Piecework a Virtue for Charles Bronson Piecework a Virtue for Bronson Warga, Wayne. Los Angeles Times 2 Nov 1975: o1</ref> Winner was firstly anxious about his decision to cast [[Jill Ireland]], Bronson's real life wife for the role of Paul Kersey's wife, Joanna Kersey. After Winner told this to Bronson, he said, \"No. I don't want her humiliated and messed around by these actors who play muggers. You know the sort of person we want? Someone who looks like [[Hope Lange]].\", to which Winner replied, \"Well, Charlie, the person who looks most like Hope Lange is Hope Lange. So I'll get her.\". Ireland would later go on to play Kersey's love interest in, [[Death Wish II]]. The film project was dropped by [[United Artists]] after budget constraints forced producers Hal Landers and [[Bobby Roberts (film producer)|Bobby Roberts]] to liquidate their rights. The original producers were replaced by Italian film mogul [[Dino De Laurentiis]].<ref name=\"Nikki Tranter\"/> De Laurentiis convinced [[Charles Bluhdorn]] to bring the project to [[Paramount Pictures]]. Paramount purchased the distribution rights of the film in the United States market, while [[Columbia Pictures]] licensed the distribution rights for international markets. De Laurentiis raised the $3 million budget of the film by pre-selling the distribution rights.<ref name=\"Nikki Tranter\"/> With funding secured, screenwriter Gerald Wilson was hired to revise the script. His first task was changing the identity of the vigilante to make the role more suitable for Bronson. \"Paul Benjamin\" was renamed to \"Paul Kersey.\" His job was changed from accountant to architect. His background changed from a World War II veteran to a Korean War veteran. The reason for him not seeing combat duty changed from serving as an army accountant to being a [[conscientious objector]].<ref name=\"Talbot\"/> Several vignettes from Mayes' script were deemed unnecessary and so were deleted.<ref name=\"Talbot\"/>\n\n===Filming===\n\nWinner himself asked for several revisions in the script. Both the novel and the original script had no scenes showing the vigilante interacting with his wife. Winner decided to include a prologue depicting a happy relationship and so the prologue of the film depicts the couple vacationing in Hawaii.<ref name=\"Talbot\"/> The early draft of the script had the vigilante being inspired by seeing a fight scene in the [[Western (genre)|Western]] film ''[[High Noon]]''. Winner decided on a more elaborate scene, involving a fight scene in a recreation of the [[American frontier|Wild West]], taking place in [[Tucson, Arizona]]. The final script had the vigilante making an occasional reference to Westerns. While confronting an armed mugger, he challenges him to draw (Kersey tells him to \"fill your hand,\" the same challenge issued by Western movie icon [[John Wayne]] to his main opponent in the climactic shootout in 1969's ''[[True Grit (1969 film)|True Grit]]''). When Ochoa tells him to get out of town, he asks if he has until sundown to do so.<ref name=\"Talbot\"/> The killing in the subway station was supposed to remain off-screen in Mayes' script, but Winner decided to turn this into an actual, brutal scene.<ref name=\"Talbot\"/> A minor argument occurred when it came to a shooting location for the film. Bronson asked for a California-based location so that he could visit his family in [[Bel Air, Los Angeles]]. Winner insisted on New York City and De Laurentiis agreed. Ultimately, Bronson backed down.<ref name=\"Talbot\"/> ''Death Wish'' was shot on location in New York City during the winter of 1973\u20131974.<ref name=\"Talbot\"/> ''Death Wish'' was first released to American audiences in July 1974. The world premiere took place on July 24 in the [[Loews Cineplex Entertainment|Loews Theater]] of New York City.<ref name=\"Talbot\"/> During the whole production, the crew members had to wear face masks, due to the freezing temperatures that would make the water in their eyes freeze.\n\n==Music==\n{{Main|Death Wish (soundtrack)}}\nMultiple [[Grammy]] award-winning jazz musician [[Herbie Hancock]] produced and composed the original score for the soundtrack to the movie. It was his third film score, after the 1966 movie ''[[Blowup|Blow-up]]'' and ''[[The Spook Who Sat by the Door (film)|The Spook Who Sat By The Door]]'' (1973). Michael Winner said, \"[Dino] De Laurentiis said 'Get a cheap English band.' Because the English bands were very successful. But I had a girlfriend who was in ''[[Sesame Street]]'', a Puerto Rican actress ([[Sonia Manzano]]), who played a checkout girl at the supermarket [in ''Death Wish''], and she was a great jazz fan. She said, 'Well, you should have Herbie Hancock. He's got this record out called ''[[Head Hunters]]''.' She gave me ''Head Hunters'', which was staggering. And I said, 'Dino, never mind a cheap English band, we'll have Herbie Hancock.' Which we did.\"{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\nHancock's theme for the film was quoted in \"[[Judge, Jury and Executioner]],\" a 2013 single by [[Atoms for Peace (band)|Atoms for Peace]].{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\n==Release==\n===Home media===\nThe film was first released on [[VHS]], [[Betamax]] and [[LaserDisc]] in 1980.

The film led him to write a follow-up titled ''[[Death Sentence (novel)|Death Sentence]]'', which was published a year after the film's release.

Bronson became an American film icon, who experienced great popularity over the next twenty years.\n* In the series' later years, the ''Death Wish'' franchise became a subject of parody for its high level of violence and the advancing age of Bronson (a 1995 episode of ''[[The Simpsons]]'', \"[[A Star Is Burns]],\" showed a fictional advertisement for ''Death Wish 9'', consisting of a bed-ridden Bronson saying \"I wish I was dead\"). However, the ''Death Wish'' franchise remained lucrative and drew support from fans of exploitation cinema. The series continues to have a widespread following on home video and is occasionally broadcast on various television stations in the US and Europe.\n* In an episode of ''[[American Dad!]]'', \"[[The One That Got Away (American Dad!)|The One That Got Away]]\", Roger dresses similarly to the protagonist when he plans revenge on an alternate personality of himself. He tells an alternate character that ''Death Wish'' was a movie, when his reference via outfit is misconstrued.\n* Bronson is mentioned in the 1997 [[The Notorious B.I.G.]] classic \"Kick in the Door\".
