His corrupt [[political boss]], Jim Taylor ([[Edward Arnold (actor)|Edward Arnold]]), pressures Hopper to choose his handpicked stooge, Horace Miller, while popular committees want a reformer, Henry Hill. The governor's children want him to select Jefferson Smith ([[James Stewart]]), the head of the Boy Rangers. Unable to make up his mind between Taylor's stooge and the reformer, Hopper decides to flip a coin. When it lands on edge \u2013 and next to a newspaper story on one of Smith's accomplishments \u2013 he chooses Smith, calculating that his wholesome image will please the people. At the same time, his [[naivety]] will make him easy to manipulate.\n\nJunior Senator Smith is taken under the wing of the publicly esteemed, but secretly crooked, Senator Joseph Paine ([[Claude Rains]]), who was Smith's late father's friend. Smith develops an immediate attraction to the senator's daughter, Susan ([[Astrid Allwyn]]). At Senator Paine's home, Smith has a conversation with Susan, fidgeting and bumbling, entranced by the young socialite. Smith's na\u00efve and honest nature allows the unforgiving Washington press to take advantage of him, quickly tarnishing Smith's reputation with ridiculous front-page pictures and headlines branding him a [[yokel|bumpkin]].\n\nTo keep Smith busy, Paine suggests he propose a bill. With the help of his secretary, Clarissa Saunders ([[Jean Arthur]]), who was the aide to Smith's predecessor and had been around Washington and politics for years, Smith comes up with a bill to authorize a federal government loan to buy some land in his home state for a national boys' camp, to be paid back by youngsters across America. Donations pour in immediately. However, the proposed campsite is already part of a dam-building [[graft (politics)|graft]] scheme included in an appropriations bill framed by the Taylor [[political machine]] and supported by Senator Paine.\n\nUnwilling to crucify the worshipful Smith so that their graft plan will go through, Paine tells Taylor he wants out, but Taylor reminds him that Paine is in power primarily through Taylor's influence. Paine then advises Smith to keep silent about the matter. The following day, when Smith speaks out about the bill at Senate, the machine in his state\u2014through Paine\u2014accuses Smith of trying to profit from his bill by producing fraudulent evidence that Smith already owns the land in question. Smith is too shocked and angry by Paine's betrayal to defend himself and runs away.\n\nSaunders, who looked down on Smith at first, but has come to believe in him, talks him into launching a [[filibuster]] to postpone the appropriations bill and prove his innocence on the Senate floor just before the vote to expel him. In his last chance to prove his innocence, he talks non-stop for about 25 hours, reaffirming the American ideals of freedom and disclosing the dam scheme's true motives. Yet none of the Senators are convinced.\n\nThe constituents try to rally around him, but the entrenched opposition is too powerful, and all attempts are crushed. Owing to the influence of Taylor's machine, newspapers and radio stations in Smith's home state, on Taylor's orders, refuse to report what Smith has to say and even distort the facts against the senator. The Boy Rangers' effort to spread the news in support of Smith results in vicious attacks on the children by Taylor's minions.\n\nAlthough all hope seems lost, the senators begin to pay attention as Smith approaches utter exhaustion. Paine has one last card up his sleeve: he brings in bins of letters and telegrams from Smith's home state, purportedly from average people demanding his expulsion. Nearly broken by the news, Smith finds a small ray of hope in a friendly smile from the President of the Senate ([[Harry Carey (actor)|Harry Carey]]). Smith vows to press on until people believe him but immediately collapses in a faint. Overcome with the pangs of remorse, Paine leaves the Senate chamber and attempts to commit suicide by gunshot but is stopped by onlooking senators. He then bursts back into the Senate chamber, shouting a confession to the whole scheme; the reformed Paine further insists that he must be expelled from the Senate and affirms Smith's innocence to Clarissa's delight. The President of the Senate observes the ensuing chaos with amusement.\n\n==Cast==\n{{col-begin}}{{col-break}}\n* [[Jean Arthur]] as Clarissa Saunders\n* [[James Stewart]] as Jefferson \"Jeff\" Smith\n* [[Claude Rains]] as Senator Joseph Harrison \"Joe\" Paine\n* [[Edward Arnold (actor)|Edward Arnold]] as Jim Taylor\n* [[Guy Kibbee]] as Governor Hubert \"Happy\" Hopper\n* [[Thomas Mitchell (actor)|Thomas Mitchell]] as \"Diz\" Moore\n* [[Eugene Pallette]] as Chick McGann\n* [[Beulah Bondi]] as Ma Smith\n* [[H.

[[Joseph Breen]], the head of that office, warned the studios: \"[W]e would urge most earnestly that you take serious counsel before embarking on the production of any motion picture based on this story. It looks to us like one that might well be loaded with dynamite, both for the motion picture industry, and for the country at large.\" Breen specifically objected to \"the generally unflattering portrayal of our system of Government, which might well lead to such a picture being considered, both here, and more particularly abroad, as a covert attack on the Democratic{{sic?|reason=Is this really capitalised?|date=December 2021}} form of government\", and warned that the film should make clear that \"the Senate is made up of a group of fine, upstanding citizens, who labor long and tirelessly for the best interests of the nation\".\n\n[[File:James Stewart in Mr. Smith Goes to Washington trailer crop.JPG|thumb|A beleaguered [[James Stewart]]]]\nLater, after the screenplay had been written and submitted, Breen reversed course, saying of the film, \"It is a grand yarn that will do a great deal of good for all those who see it and, in my judgment, it is particularly fortunate that this kind of story is to be made at this time.

S.

That did not happen, but one of the ways that some senators attempted to retaliate for the damage they felt the film had done to the reputation of their institution was by pushing the passage of the [[Matthew M. Neely|Neely]] Anti-Block Booking Bill, which eventually led to the breakup of the studio-owned theater chains in the late 1940s. Columbia responded by distributing a program which put forward the film's patriotism and support of democracy and publicized the film's many positive reviews.<ref>Capra 1971, p. 289.</ref>\n\nOther objections were voiced as well. [[Joseph P. Kennedy]], the American Ambassador to Great Britain, wrote to Capra and Columbia head [[Harry Cohn]] to say that he feared the film would damage \"America\u2019s prestige in Europe\", and because of this urged that it be withdrawn from European release.
