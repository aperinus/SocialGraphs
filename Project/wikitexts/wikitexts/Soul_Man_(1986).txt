Black]]. [[C. Thomas Howell]] stars as a white law student who pretends to be black in order to qualify for a [[scholarship]]. Its title refers to the [[Soul Man (song)|song of the same name]] by [[Isaac Hayes]] and [[David Porter (musician)|David Porter]]; the original soundtrack includes a version performed by [[Sam Moore]] and [[Lou Reed]].\n\nThe film gained controversy due to Howell's makeup drawing comparisons to [[blackface]], prompting protests against its release. Despite the controversy and negative reviews from critics, ''Soul Man'' was a commercial success, grossing $35 million on a $4.5 million budget.\n\n==Plot==\nMark Watson is the pampered son of a rich family who is about to attend [[Harvard Law School]] along with his best friend Gordon. Unfortunately, his father's neurotic psychiatrist talks his patient into having more fun for himself instead of spending money on his son. Faced with the prospect of having to pay for law school by himself, Mark decides to apply for a scholarship, but the only suitable one is for [[African-Americans]] only. He decides to cheat by using [[Sunless tanning|tanning pills]] in a larger dose than prescribed to appear as an African-American. Watson then sets out for Harvard, na\u00efvely believing that black people have no problems at all in American society.\n\nHowever, once immersed in a black student's life, Mark finds out prejudice and racism truly exists. He meets a young African-American student named Sarah Walker, whom he first only flirts with; gradually, however, he genuinely falls in love with her. In passing, she mentions that he received the scholarship she was in the running for at the last minute. Due to this, she not only has to handle her classes but work as a waitress to support herself and her young son George.\n\nSlowly, Mark begins to regret his deed since he has landed in jail under suspicion of stealing his own car, been the subject of stereotypes of black men and pursued by his landlord's daughter and classmate Whitney simply because he's not white.\n\nAfter a chaotic day in which Sarah, his parents (who are not aware of his double life) and Whitney all make surprise visits at the same time, he drops the charade and publicly reveals himself to be white. Most people he has come into contact with realize this makes sense, but Sarah is furious.\n\nOnce the charade is over, Mark speaks to his professor. He has learned more than he bargained for, admitting that he still doesn't know what it is like to be black because he could have changed back to being white at any time.\n\nBecause Mark must forfeit his scholarship, his father agrees to loan him the money for school, but with exorbitant interest. He goes to Sarah and begs for another chance, to which she agrees after Mark stands up for her and George when two male students tell a racist joke in front of them.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[C.

If you watch the movie, it's really making white people look stupid\u2026 [The film] is adorable and it didn't deserve it... I always tried to be an actor who was doing a part that was a character versus what I call 'blackting,' or playing my race, because I knew that I would fail because I was mixed. I was the black actor for sure, but I didn't lead with my epidermis, and that offended people like Spike Lee, I think. You're either militant or you're not and he decided to just attack. I've never forgiven him for that because it really hurt me. I didn't realize [at the time] that not pushing the [[Afrocentrism|afro-centric]] agenda was going to bite me.

This isn\u2019t a movie about blackface. This isn\u2019t a movie that should be considered irresponsible on any level... It\u2019s very funny... It made me much more aware of the issues we face on a day-to-day basis, and it made me much more sensitive to racism... It\u2019s an innocent movie, it\u2019s got innocent messages, and it\u2019s got some very, very deep messages. And I think the people that haven\u2019t seen it that judge it are horribly wrong. I think that\u2019s more offensive than anything. Judging something you haven\u2019t seen is the worst thing you can really do. In fact, Soul Man sort of represents that all the way through. I think it\u2019s a really innocent movie with a very powerful message, and it\u2019s an important part of my life. I\u2019m proud of the performance, and I\u2019m proud of the people that were in it.  A lot of people ask me today, \u201cCould that movie be made today?\"... Robert Downey Jr. just did it in ''[[Tropic Thunder]]''!... The difference is that he was just playing a character in ''Tropic Thunder'', and there was no magnifying glass on racism, which is so prevalent in our country. I guess that\u2019s what makes people more uncomfortable about Soul Man. But I think it\u2019s an important movie.<ref name=\"avclub\"/></blockquote>\n\nDefunct [[mathcore]] band [[Botch (band)|Botch]] has a track named \"C.
