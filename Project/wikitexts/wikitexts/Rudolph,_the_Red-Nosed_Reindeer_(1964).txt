They are surprised to find out he was born with a glowing red nose. Donner attempts to first cover Rudolph's nose with mud, and later uses a fake nose, so Rudolph will fit in with the other reindeer. The following spring, Rudolph goes out for the reindeer games, where the new fawns learn to fly and are scouted by Santa for future sleigh duty. Rudolph meets a doe named Clarice, who tells him he is cute, making Rudolph fly. While he celebrates with the other bucks, Rudolph's fake nose pops off, causing the other reindeer to mock him and Coach Comet to expel him.\n\nRudolph meets and joins Hermey, a misfit [[Christmas elf|elf]] who left Santa's workshop because he wants to be a [[dentist]], and Yukon Cornelius, a prospector who has spent his life searching for silver and gold. After escaping the [[yeti|Abominable Snow Monster]], all three land on the Island of Misfit Toys. It is a place where unloved or unwanted toys reside with their ruler, a [[winged lion]] named King Moonracer, who brings the toys to the island until he can find homes and children who will love them. The king allows them to stay one night on the island and asks them to ask Santa to find homes for them. Rudolph leaves on his own, worried that his nose will endanger his friends.\n\nTime passes and Rudolph, now a young stag, returns home to find that his parents and Clarice have been searching for him. He then travels to the Abominable's cave, where they are being held captive. Rudolph attempts to rescue Clarice until the monster knocks him down with a stalactite. Hermey and Yukon eventually show up with a plan to help out Rudolph. Hermey lures the monster out of the cave by imitating the sound of a pig and pulls out the Abominable's teeth after Yukon knocks him out. Yukon drives the toothless monster back over a cliff and falls with it.\n\nRudolph, Hermey, Clarice, and the Donners return home where everyone apologizes to them. Yukon returns with a tamed Abominable, now trained to trim a Christmas tree, explaining that the monster's bouncing ability saved both of their lives. Christmas Eve comes and while everybody is celebrating, Santa announces that a big snowstorm is approaching, forcing him to cancel Christmas. Blinded by Rudolph's bright nose, he changes his mind and asks Rudolph to lead the sleigh. Rudolph accepts, and their first stop is the Island of Misfit Toys, where Santa delivers the toys to children.\n\n== Cast ==\n[[File:Hermey the elf and Rudolph.jpg|thumb|right|Hermey and Rudolph]]\n* [[Burl Ives]] as Sam the Snowman\n* [[Larry D.

He can be seen throughout the special tossing his pickax into the air, sniffing, then licking the end that contacts the snow or ice. Deletion of the peppermint segment in 1965, to make room for Santa traveling to the Island of Misfit Toys, leaves the audience to assume that Cornelius was attempting to find either silver or gold by taste alone.<ref name=\"7FactsRudolph\" />\n\n=== 1965\u20131997 telecasts ===\nThe 1965 broadcast also included a new duet between Rudolph and Hermey called \"Fame and Fortune\", which replaced a scene in which the same characters sang \"We're a Couple of Misfits\". Viewers of the 1964 special complained that Santa was not shown fulfilling his promise to the Misfit Toys (to include them in his annual toy delivery).<ref name=\"7FactsRudolph\" /> In reaction, a new scene for subsequent rebroadcasts was produced with Santa making his first stop at the Island to pick up the toys. This is the ending that has been shown on all telecasts and video releases ever since. Until sometime in the 1970s, the special aired without additional cuts, but eventually more commercial time was required by the network. In 1978, several sequences were deleted to make room for more advertising: the instrumental bridge from \"We Are Santa's Elves\" featuring the elf orchestra, additional dialogue by Burl Ives, and the \"Peppermint Mine\" scene resolving the fate of Yukon Cornelius.<ref name=\"7FactsRudolph\" /> The special's 1993 restoration saw \"Misfits\" returned to its original film context, and the 2004 DVD release showcases \"Fame and Fortune\" as a separate musical number.\n\n=== 1998\u20132004 CBS telecasts ===\nMost of the 1965 deletions were restored in 1998, and \"Fame and Fortune\" was replaced with the original \"We're a Couple of Misfits\" reprise. A short slide reading \"Rankin/Bass Presents\" was inserted at the beginning of the special to reflect the company's name change.\n\n=== 2005\u2013present telecasts ===\nStarting in 2005, CBS re-inserted the \"Fame and Fortune\" scene, albeit with the soundtrack replaced by a rather hastily edited version of \"We're a Couple of Misfits\".<ref name=\"7FactsRudolph\" /> The special has also been edited to make more time for commercial advertising.\n\n=== 2019\u2013present Freeform broadcast edit ===\nIn May 2019, it was announced that [[Freeform (TV channel)|Freeform]] will air the special as part of their annual [[25 Days of Christmas]] line-up for the first time, alongside ''[[Frosty the Snowman (film)|Frosty the Snowman]]''.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://deadline.com/2019/05/freeform-expands-31-nights-of-halloween-programming-1202614230/ |title=Freeform Expands '31 Nights of Halloween' Programming With 'Ghostbusters' and Other Classics |last=Bennett |first=Anita |date=May 14, 2019 |website=Deadline}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.countryliving.com/life/entertainment/a27509969/freeform-25-days-of-christmas-2019-schedule/ |title=Freeform Revealed Major Details About '25 Days of Christmas' for 2019 |last=Lowin |first=Rebekah |date=May 17, 2019 |website=Country Living}}</ref> The agreement was later revealed not to be an exclusive rights agreement, as CBS retained their broadcast rights to air the special twice under a separate license with [[Classic Media]]/Universal.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://pittsburgh.cbslocal.com/2019/10/29/cbs-holiday-special-schedule-released/|title=CBS Holiday TV Special Schedule Released; Here's when You Can Watch Rudolph and Frosty|date=October 29, 2019}}</ref> CBS still shows the version they have had since 2005, while Freeform's airings reinsert much of the material deleted or changed from CBS's broadcasts, such as the original version of \"We're a Couple of Misfits\" as well as the \"Peppermint Mine\" scene, making it the first time that the latter scene has been seen on television since the original broadcast. Freeform's print of the special also has the 2012 Universal Pictures logo preceding the special, due to their purchase of Classic Media's owner, [[DreamWorks Animation]] in 2016.\n\n== Home media ==\nWhen ''Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer'' was first released on [[VHS]] and [[LaserDisc]] by [[Family Home Entertainment]] under license from [[Broadway Video]] from 1989 to 1996 under the ''Christmas Classics Series'' label, the 1965 rebroadcast print described above was used. It got re-released in 1997 by [[Family Home Entertainment]] under license from [[DreamWorks Classics|Golden Books Family Entertainment]]. It used the same print, but with the GBFE logo at the end instead of the Broadway Video logo. All current video prints of ''Rudolph'' by [[DreamWorks Classics|Classic Media]] are a compendium of the two previous telecast versions of the special.

Many of the songs are utilized in the score as [[leitmotif|musical themes]] for recurring characters and ideas, such as \"Silver and Gold\" (for Yukon Cornelius, sung by Burl Ives), \"Jingle, Jingle, Jingle\" (Santa, sung by Stan Francis) and \"There's Always Tomorrow\" (Clarice, sung by Janis Orenstein).  Some of these themes are modified for dramatic purposes, particularly those of the Abominable Snow Monster, who has several interwoven themes; a primary motif, indicated by brass and an F minor key; a modulating chase theme led by tack piano; a tritonal attack theme combining the latter two; and finally the deleted song \"The Abominable Snow Monster\",<ref>{{cite book|last1=Goldschmidt|first1=Rick|title=The Making of the Rankin/Bass Holiday Classic: Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer|year=2014|orig-year=2001|publisher=Miser Bros.

None of the film's original score has ever been released.\n\nIn 1964, an [[LP record]] of the soundtrack was released on [[Decca Records]]. It contained different mixes of the original songs performed as they are in the special, with the exception of Burl Ives' material, which has been re-recorded. [[MCA Records|MCA Special Products]] released the soundtrack on CD in June 1995. It is an exact duplication of the original LP released in 1964. Tracks 1-9 are the remixed soundtrack selections while tracks 10-19 are the same songs performed by the Decca Concert Orchestra. The song \"Fame and Fortune\" is not contained on either release. On November 30, 2004, the soundtrack was certified Gold by the Recording Industry Association of America for selling over 500,000 copies.\n\nIves re-recorded \"A Holly Jolly Christmas\", with different arrangements, for the song's [[A Holly Jolly Christmas|1964 single release]].{{refn|group=note|None of the soundtrack's recordings were ever released as singles.

A dream sequence produced and directed by Quakenbush, Kelso himself appears in stop-motion form with Rudolph and Santa who encourage him to continue watching their show.\n* In December 2005, the ''[[George Lopez (TV series)|George Lopez]]'' Show featured an animated segment in which [[George Lopez|Lopez]] sees a stop-motion version of himself on television in a ''Rudolph''-style special mirroring the theme of the holiday episode.\n* In the stop-motion animated film ''[[The Nightmare Before Christmas]]'' (1993), Jack looks through a book version of ''Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer'' to find a logical answer to explain Christmas to the other citizens of Halloween Town. Later, Zero, the ghost dog, has a magnificently glowing pumpkin nose, which is bright enough to break through the fog that Sally has conjured up. Jack lets Zero go to the head of his skeleton reindeer team and light the way for him.\n* [[Chel White]], of [[Bent Image Lab]], directed two parodies that played on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''', on [[Robert Smigel]]'s ''[[TV Funhouse]]'':\n** In a 2001 ''TV Funhouse'' episode, Sam the Snowman refuses to narrate the story because of the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]] (even finding the fear of Bumble to be trivial in comparison to America fighting [[War in Afghanistan (2001-2021)|a war]] in [[Afghanistan]]). He then takes two children to [[World Trade Center site|Ground Zero]] at New York City, but Santa Claus convinces him to narrate the story, because people need comforting stories like ''Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer.'' Sam decided to narrate the tale, but was immediately interrupted by a special news report. The sketch ends with a silently-furious Sam smashing his banjo over his head.\n** In 2004, ''TV Funhouse'' referenced the [[Red state-blue state divide]]. In the segment, Santa hangs out with liberal celebrities [[Natalie Merchant]], [[Margaret Cho]], [[Al Franken]], and [[Moby]] while skipping over the Red states (\"screw the red states, voting for that dumbass president just because of that [[family values|moral values]] crap. I don't want any part of them!\"). Rudolph's red nose turns blue.\n* In 2004, for ''Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer'''s 40th [[anniversary]], CBS produced stop motion promos for their programming line-up, done in the style of Rankin/Bass animation. Appearing as [[elf|elves]] in the CBS promos were puppet versions of CBS stars [[Jeff Probst]] from ''[[Survivor (U.S. TV series)|Survivor]]'', [[Ray Romano]] and [[Doris Roberts]] from ''[[Everybody Loves Raymond]]'', [[William Petersen]] and [[Marg Helgenberger]] from ''[[CSI: Crime Scene Investigation|CSI]]'', [[Charlie Sheen]] from ''[[Two and a Half Men]]'', [[Phil Simms]] and [[Greg Gumbel]] from ''The [[NFL on CBS]]'', and late-night talk show host [[David Letterman]]. A new stop-motion animation featuring Rudolph and Santa meeting even more CBS network stars was also aired in 2005.\n* ''[[Mystery Science Theater 3000]]'' made numerous references to the special in their movie hecklings, such as Rudolph's line \"I'm cute!! I'm cuute!! She said I'm ''cuuuuuutte!!!!''\". In episode 321, which screened ''[[Santa Claus Conquers the Martians]]'', the MST3K cast had their own ideas for potential residents on the Island of Misfit Toys including Toaster Dolls, [[Patrick Swayze]]'s ''[[Road House (1989 film)|Roadhouse]]'' board game, the [[Easy-Bake Oven|EZ Bake]] Foundry, and [[Mr. Potato Head|Mr. Mashed Potato Head]].\n\n=== Uses in advertising ===\n* In 1964, Rankin & Bass produced several commercials for the General Electric-sponsored broadcast.<ref name=\"RudolphCommercials\" />\n* In November 2007, the [[Aflac]] insurance company released a commercial that featured Rudolph, who has a cold but does not want to miss work.
