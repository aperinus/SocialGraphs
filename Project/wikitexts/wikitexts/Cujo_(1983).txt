Meanwhile, the Trenton family \u2014 advertising executive Vic, housewife Donna, and their sensitive young son Tad \u2014 take their car to the rural home of abusive mechanic Joe Camber for some repairs, where they meet Cujo, the Camber family's pet, and get along well with him.\n\nDonna notices Cujo's bitten nose but thinks little of it. Later, Vic and Donna's marriage is tested when Vic learns that Donna is having an affair with her ex-boyfriend from high school, Steve Kemp, while Vic's advertising for a cereal commercial is failing. The early signs of Cujo's infection start to appear, including sensitivity to loud noises, and fraying temper producing soft growls, but no one notices these changes in his behavior. Charity and Brett, Joe's wife and son, leave the house for a week to visit Charity's sister Holly. On the morning of their departure, the furious stage of the infection begins to set in; though Cujo refrains from attacking Brett, he soon goes completely mad and kills the Cambers' alcoholic neighbor Gary Pervier. Shortly afterwards, Joe goes to Gary's house and finds him dead, then tries to call the authorities just before Cujo appears and attacks him.\n\nVic goes out of town on a business trip, as Donna and Tad return to the Cambers' house for more car repairs. Cujo attacks them, and they are forced to take shelter in their [[Ford Pinto]]. Donna tries to drive home, but the car's [[alternator]] dies and the two are trapped inside. The hot sun makes conditions nearly unbearable, and Donna realizes that she must do something before they both die from [[heatstroke]] or [[dehydration]]. However, attempts at escape are foiled by Cujo repeatedly attacking the car, breaking a window in the process, and even biting Donna. Vic returns home to rekindle his marriage, only to find Donna and Tad missing and his house vandalized by Kemp. He suspects the possessive Kemp of kidnapping, but the police realize his wife and son might be at the Cambers house.\n\nThe local sheriff, George Bannerman, arrives at the mechanics house and has a brief standoff; before he can draw his gun, Cujo kills him, knocking him off the catwalk in the barn and mauling him to death. Later, Donna attempts to get to the house to bring a dehydrated and overheated Tad water but is stopped by Cujo; she fights him off with a [[baseball bat]] until it breaks, leaving only a jagged handle. Cujo jumps at her and is [[Impalement|impaled]] in the [[stomach]] by the broken bat. Donna takes the sheriff's gun and contemplates shooting him, but decides saving Tad is more important. After Donna revives Tad inside the kitchen, Cujo, still alive, breaks through the kitchen window and tries to attack Donna. However, Donna shoots Cujo dead before Vic arrives and reunites with his family.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Dee Wallace]] as Donna Trenton\n* [[Danny Pintauro]] as Tad Trenton\n* [[Daniel Hugh Kelly|Daniel Hugh-Kelly]] as Vic Trenton\n* [[Christopher Stone (actor)|Christopher Stone]] as Steve Kemp\n* [[Ed Lauter]] as Joe Camber\n* [[Kaiulani Lee]] as Charity Camber\n* [[Billy Jayne|Billy Jacoby]] as Brett Camber\n* [[Mills Watson]] as Gary Pervier\n* [[Jerry Hardin]] as Masen\n* [[Sandy Ward]] as Sheriff George Bannerman\n* Arthur Rosenberg as Roger Breakstone\n\n== Production ==\n{{expand section|date=October 2016}}\nThe original director was [[Peter Medak]], who left the project two days into filming, along with [[Cinematographer|DOP]] [[Anthony B.
