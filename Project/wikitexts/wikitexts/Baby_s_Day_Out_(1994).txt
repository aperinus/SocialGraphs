After the kidnapping, however, the criminals have difficulty controlling Bink at their apartment. Norby attempts to put him to sleep by reading his favorite storybook, ''Baby's Day Out'' (or \"Boo-boo\", as he calls it), only to fall asleep himself from boredom, leaving Bink unattended. Looking through the book, Bink notices a bird on the page and then one by the window; he follows it out and successfully gets away from his kidnappers. The ensuing chase culminates in Eddie falling off the building and into a garbage bin. Norby and Veeko rescue him and they begin pursuing Bink across the city.\n\nThe [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] arrives at the mansion, headed by Dale Grissom, where they try to piece together clues along with Bink's parents and his nanny Gilbertine. Meanwhile, Bink, now outside on the ground and crawling about, finds another part of his book \u2013 the blue bus, which he then boards. The criminals realize he is escaping and start chasing the bus in their van, but their efforts are in vain.\n\nMeanwhile on the bus, Bink crawls into the bag of an obese lady who gets off at her stop shortly afterwards. By the time the criminals catch the bus, they realize Bink is not on board and follow the lady, leading to an altercation after she catches them. In the distraction, Bink crawls up to a revolving door at the entrance to a department store and is forced inwards by its momentum. He is stopped by an employee who works for the store's day care center, believing he is another baby who escaped from there. He then escapes from the store and eventually crawls into traffic after a ride on a taxi.\n\nThe criminals attempt to follow him, but keep getting injured in the process as he makes his way to the city zoo. They are shocked to find him in the ape house with a [[western lowland gorilla]], which shows a paternal side and does not injure him. The gorilla also feeds Bink with some of its fruits. The criminals try to retrieve him, but the gorilla notices them; it pounds Veeko's hand, throws Norby into the air using a mop as a catapult, and hurls Eddie against the bars of another nearby cage.\n\nThe criminals corner and catch Bink in the zoo's park, but are confronted by two chatty police officers who have noticed that their van's engine is still running. During the conversation, Eddie hides Bink under his coat in his lap, but Bink reaches his cigarette lighter, setting his groin on fire and sneaking off as soon as the officers are gone. Veeko extinguishes the fire by stomping repeatedly on Eddie's groin.\n\nThey then follow Bink to a construction site where they experience several near-death mishaps such as Veeko getting thrown off the building and into the back of a garbage truck, Norby falling into a vat of wet cement, and Eddie getting stranded on a crane after being drenched in glue. The sun then sets as Bink and the construction crew leave the site. After managing to escape, the criminals give up on catching Bink and return home.\n\nBink's parents are notified of various sightings of him in the city and Gilbertine deduces that he has been following ''Baby's Day Out'', and will most likely head for the Old Soldiers' Home next. They find him there, but on the way home, he begins to call out for his \"Boo-Boo\" toward the criminals' flat. The recuperating criminals, upon hearing Bink calling out for his book, realize that he has returned, and upon looking out the window, to their shock, they find themselves surrounded by the FBI, who have arrived to arrest them, and also find Bink and his parents standing outside the building as well. As Eddie berates Bink for ratting them out, Grissom forces the criminals to return Bink's book.\n\nBack at home, Bink is put to bed by his parents, who discuss having his picture taken by a normal photographer in the morning while, unbeknownst to them, he wakes up and gets ready to read another book titled ''Baby's Trip to China''.\n\n==Cast==\n* Adam Robert Worton and Jacob Joseph Worton as Bennington Austin \"Bink\" Cotwell IV\n** [[Verne Troyer]] as Bink's [[stunt double]].\n* [[Joe Mantegna]] as Edgar \"Eddie\" Mauser\n* [[Joe Pantoliano]] as Norbert \"Norby\" LeBlaw\n* [[Brian Haley]] as Victor \"Veeko\" Riley\n* [[Lara Flynn Boyle]] as Laraine Cotwell\n* [[Matthew Glave]] as Bennington Austin \"Bing\" Cotwell III\n* [[Cynthia Nixon]] as Gilbertine\n* [[Fred Thompson]] as FBI Agent Dale Grissom\n* [[John Neville (actor)|John Neville]] as Mr. Andrews\n* Robin Baber as the fat lady\n* Trevor Dalton as Norm\n* [[Eddie Bracken]] as Old Soldier\n* Dawn Maxey as Teenage Employee\n* [[Anna Thomson]] as Mrs. McCray\n* [[John Alexander (puppeteer)|John Alexander]] as the gorilla's in-suit performer\n** Jugen Heimann, Tom Hester, Mark Setrakian, and Marc L.
