The fifth installment in [[The Omen (franchise)|''The Omen'' series]], it is a remake of the [[The Omen|1976 film of the same name]], which was also written by Seltzer. This version stars [[Julia Stiles]], [[Liev Schreiber]], [[Mia Farrow]], [[David Thewlis]], [[Pete Postlethwaite]], [[Michael Gambon]] and [[Seamus Davey-Fitzpatrick]] in his film debut.\n\nIt was released worldwide on June 6, 2006, by [[20th Century Fox]]. It received mixed reviews from critics and grossed $120 million against a $25 million budget.\n\n== Plot ==\nRobert Thorn, an American diplomat stationed in Italy is told that his son was stillborn. Unknown to his unconscious wife, Katherine, Robert adopts an orphaned newborn at the suggestion of the hospital's chaplain [[Catholic priest]], Father Spiletto. Naming him [[Damien Thorn|Damien]], Robert and Katherine raise the boy. Robert's career ascends over the course of the next five years. He is named Deputy Ambassador to the [[Court of St. James]] in the United Kingdom. Following the death of the previous ambassador in a suspicious vehicle fire caused by a vagrant, Robert assumes his position and settles in a large estate just outside London. However, disturbing events begin to occur, including the suicide of Damien's nanny at his birthday party.\n\nRobert is approached by Father Brennan, who claims to have been involved with events surrounding Damien's birth. Meanwhile, photographer Keith Jennings finds that several of his photographs contain mysterious [[omen]]s, including premonitions of people's deaths. A new nanny, Mrs. Baylock, is hired. Tension rises when Mrs. Baylock starts to make decisions without the consent of the Thorns, including adopting a [[rottweiler]] for Damien's protection.\n\nFollowing an incident near a chapel in which Damien attacks Katherine, she begins experiencing vivid dreams about her son, one of these involving a red-hooded [[jackal]] skeleton. When the Thorns visit a zoo, the animals react violently at the sight of Damien. Katherine begins to wonder if there is something wrong with Damien. Father Brennan confronts Robert, telling him that Damien's mother was a jackal and that the boy is the [[Antichrist]]. He explains that Damien must die and a man named Bugenhagen who is located in [[Tel Megiddo|Megiddo]] can assist. After being rebuked, Father Brennan is killed during a lightning storm.\n\nKatherine discovers she is pregnant and is determined to get an abortion, in fear of having a child similar to Damien. Soon afterward, Damien causes an accident in which Katherine is severely injured resulting in her miscarriage. While recovering in the hospital, Katherine confides in Robert her suspicions that Damien is evil. Robert decides to rendezvous with Jennings and search for Damien's biological mother. The pair discover the hospital where Damien was delivered has since been demolished after a fire. They travel to Subiaco and meet Father Spiletto, who directs them to a graveyard. There they find the grave of Damien's mother, who is revealed to indeed have been a jackal. In the neighboring tomb, Robert discovers the corpse of his murdered biological son. He and Jennings are attacked by a pack of dogs and barely escape.\n\nMrs. Baylock visits Katherine in the hospital and causes her to have an [[air embolism]] which kills her. Learning of Katherine's death, Robert goes to Megiddo, meets Bugenhagen and receives instructions on how to kill Damien on consecrated ground with seven sacrificial daggers. Bugenhagen tells Robert to examine Damien for a birthmark in the shape of [[Number of the beast|three sixes (\"666\")]]. However, Robert refuses to kill his son and throws the daggers on the ground. While reaching down to pick up the daggers, Jennings is suddenly decapitated by a falling sign.\n\nRobert takes the daggers, arrives home and is attacked by Mrs. Baylock's Rottweiler, which he traps in the basement. In Damien's room, he finds the 666 birthmark. Mrs. Baylock attacks Robert. He fends her off, takes Damien, and drives to a nearby cathedral, running over Mrs. Baylock in the process. Pursued by the police, Robert flees to a church to kill Damien but is shot dead before he can by a [[Parliamentary and Diplomatic Protection|Diplomatic Protection]] officer.\n\nAs the [[Pope]] simultaneously dies, Robert's funeral is attended by the President of the United States who holds Damien's hand. Damien then looks at the audience and smiles knowingly as the credits roll.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Liev Schreiber]] as [[Robert Thorn]]\n* [[Julia Stiles]] as Katherine Thorn\n* [[Mia Farrow]] as Mrs. Willa Baylock\n* [[Seamus Davey-Fitzpatrick]] as [[Damien Thorn]]\n* [[David Thewlis]] as Keith Jennings\n* [[Pete Postlethwaite]] as Father Brennan\n* [[Michael Gambon]] as Bugenhagen\n* [[Giovanni Lombardo Radice]] as Father Spiletto\n* [[Predrag Bjelac|Pedja Bjelac]] as Vatican Observatory Priest\n\n[[Harvey Spencer Stephens]], who portrayed Damien in the [[The Omen|original movie]], made his final onscreen appearance in a cameo role as a reporter.\n\n== Production ==\nThe film was greenlit in July 2005 with Dan McDermott attached to write and [[John Moore (director)|John Moore]] directing.<ref>{{cite news|url = https://variety.com/2005/film/markets-festivals/remake-an-omen-for-helmer-1117926220/|title = Remake an 'Omen' for helmer|work = [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date = July 19, 2005|access-date = August 9, 2020|last1 = Fleming|first1 = Michael|last2 = Brodesser|first2 = Claude}}</ref> McDermott would later be denied a writing credit by the [[Writers Guild of America]] as the screenplay was determined to bear too close a resemblance to [[David Seltzer]]'s script for the 1976 film; Seltzer received sole credit despite being uninvolved with the production of the remake.
