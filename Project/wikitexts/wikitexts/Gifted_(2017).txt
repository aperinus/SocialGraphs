It stars [[Chris Evans (actor)|Chris Evans]], [[Mckenna Grace]], [[Lindsay Duncan]], [[Jenny Slate]] and [[Octavia Spencer]]. The plot follows an [[intellectual giftedness|intellectually gifted]] seven-year-old who becomes the subject of a custody battle between her maternal uncle and maternal grandmother. The film was released on April 7, 2017, by [[Fox Searchlight Pictures]], and grossed $43 million worldwide. At the [[23rd Critics' Choice Awards]], [[Mckenna Grace]] was nominated for [[Critics' Choice Movie Award for Best Young Performer|Best Young Actor/Actress]]. The film received mixed-to-positive reviews from critics, who praised the performances of Evans and Grace, but noted its predictability.\n\n== Plot ==\nIn [[St. Petersburg, Florida]], seven-year-old Mary Adler lives with her uncle and ''[[de facto]]'' guardian, Frank. Her best friend is her 43-year-old neighbor, Roberta Taylor. On her first day of first grade, she shows remarkable mathematical talent, which impresses her teacher, Bonnie Stevenson.\n\nThere, despite her initial disdain for average children her own age and her boredom with their classwork, Mary begins to bond with them when she brings her one-eyed cat, Fred, for [[Show and tell (education)|show-and-tell]]. Later, she defends a classmate from a bully on the school bus by hitting the bully in the face. After the incident, the principal encourages Frank to send Mary to a private school for gifted children, offering the opportunity of a scholarship. However, Frank turns it down. Based on his family's experiences with similar schools, he fears she will not have a chance at a \"normal\" childhood.\n\nIt emerges that Mary's mother, Diane, had been a promising mathematician, dedicated to the [[Navier\u2013Stokes existence and smoothness|Navier\u2013Stokes problem]] (one of the unsolved [[Millennium Prize Problems]]) before dying by suicide when Mary was six months old. She has lived with Frank, a former college professor turned boat repairman, ever since.\n\nThe principal contacts Frank's estranged mother and Mary's maternal grandmother, Evelyn, who seeks to gain custody of Mary and move her to [[Massachusetts]]. Evelyn believes she is a \"one-in-a-billion\" mathematical prodigy who should be specially tutored in preparation for a life devoted to mathematics, much as Diane was. However, Frank is adamant that his sister would want Mary to be in a normal public school and have the childhood she did not have.\n\nIn court, Frank argues that Evelyn's parenting deprived Diane of a normal life; Evelyn had sent away a boy Diane was in love with, which was when she first attempted suicide. Evelyn argues that Frank is in no position to be a guardian, working a low-paying job without health insurance. Worried the judge will rule against him and he will lose Mary completely, Frank accepts a compromise brokered by his lawyer that sees Mary placed in foster care and attend the private school where Evelyn wants to have her enrolled. The foster parents live 25 minutes from Frank's home, he will be entitled to scheduled visits, and Mary will be able to decide where she wants to live after her 12th birthday.\n\nMary is devastated at being placed in foster care, and her foster father says she refuses to see Frank. When Bonnie sees a picture of Fred up for adoption, she alerts Frank. He retrieves the cat from the pound and, learning that Fred was brought in due to allergy issues, realizes that Evelyn, who is allergic to cats, is overseeing Mary's education in the guest house of Mary's foster home.\n\nFrank then reveals to Evelyn, who had been a mathematician herself, that Diane had solved the Navier\u2013Stokes problem but stipulated that the solution was to be withheld until Evelyn's death. Knowing that it meant everything to her to see Diane solve the problem, he offers her the opportunity to publish Diane's work if she drops her objection to him having custody of Mary. Evelyn agrees.\n\nThe film ends with Mary back in the custody of Frank, returning to public school and socializing with children her age while taking college-level courses.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Chris Evans (actor)|Chris Evans]] as Francis \"Frank\" Adler, Mary's uncle, Evelyn's son and Diane's brother\n* [[Mckenna Grace]] as Mary Adler, the gifted niece of Frank, Diane's only daughter and Evelyn's granddaughter\n* [[Lindsay Duncan]] as Evelyn Adler, Mary's maternal grandmother, Frank's and Diane's mother\n* [[Jenny Slate]] as Bonnie Stevenson, Mary's teacher\n* [[Octavia Spencer]] as Roberta Taylor, Mary and Frank's neighbor\n* Michael Kendall Kaplan as Justin Gilmore, Mary's classmate\n* [[Glenn Plummer]] as Greg Cullen, Frank's attorney\n* [[John Finn]] as Aubrey Highsmith, lawyer for Evelyn Adler in the case for custody of Mary\n* [[Elizabeth Marvel]] as Gloria Davis, the school principal and Bonnie's boss\n* Jon Sklaroff as Seymour Shankland, the head of [[MIT]]'s math department\n* [[Jona Xiao]] as Lijuan, a background character in the university scene who critiques the professor's equation\n* [[Julie Ann Emery]] as Pat Golding\n* [[Keir O'Donnell]] as Bradley Pollard, Mary's biological father\n* [[John M.
