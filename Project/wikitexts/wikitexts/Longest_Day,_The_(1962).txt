It was directed by [[Ken Annakin]] (British and French exteriors), [[Andrew Marton]] (American exteriors), and [[Bernhard Wicki]] (German scenes).\n\n''The Longest Day'' features a large international ensemble cast including [[John Wayne]], [[Kenneth More]], [[Richard Todd]], [[Robert Mitchum]], [[Richard Burton]], [[Steve Forrest (actor)|Steve Forrest]], [[Sean Connery]], [[Henry Fonda]], [[Red Buttons]], [[Peter Lawford]], [[Eddie Albert]], [[Jeffrey Hunter]], [[Stuart Whitman]], [[Tom Tryon]], [[Rod Steiger]], [[Leo Genn]], [[Gert Fr\u00f6be]], [[Irina Demick]], [[Bourvil]], [[Curd J\u00fcrgens]], [[George Segal]], [[Robert Wagner]], [[Paul Anka]], and [[Arletty]]. Many of these actors played roles that were essentially cameo appearances. In addition, several cast members had seen action as servicemen during the war, including Albert, Fonda, Genn, More, Steiger, and Todd; Todd was among the first British officers to land in Normandy in [[Operation Overlord]], and he participated in the assault on [[Pegasus Bridge]].\n\nThe film employed several Axis and Allied military consultants who had been actual participants on D-Day, and many had their roles re-enacted in the film. These included [[G\u00fcnther Blumentritt]] (a former German general), [[James M. Gavin]] (an American general), [[Frederick E. Morgan|Frederick Morgan]] (Deputy Chief of Staff at [[Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force|SHAEF]]), [[John Howard (British Army officer)|John Howard]] (who led the airborne assault on the [[Pegasus Bridge]]), [[Simon Fraser, 15th Lord Lovat|Lord Lovat]] (who commanded the 1st Special Service Brigade), [[Philippe Kieffer]] (who led his men in the assault on [[Ouistreham]]), [[Marie-Pierre K\u0153nig]] (who commanded the [[Free French Forces]] in the invasion), [[Max-Josef Pemsel|Max Pemsel]] (a German general), [[Werner Pluskat]] (the major who was the first German officer to see the invasion fleet), [[Josef Priller|Josef \"Pips\" Priller]] (the hot-headed pilot), and Lucie Rommel (widow of Field Marshal [[Erwin Rommel]]).\n\nThe film won two Academy Awards and was nominated for three others.\n\n==Plot synopsis==\nShot in a docudrama style (with captions identifying the different participants), the film opens in the days leading up to D-Day, concentrating on events on both sides of the [[English channel]]. The Allies wait for a break in the poor weather while anticipating the reaction of the Axis forces defending northern France. As Supreme Commander of [[SHAEF]], Gen. Dwight Eisenhower makes the decision to go after reviewing the initial bad weather reports and the reports about the divisions within the [[Oberkommando des Heeres|German High Command]] as to where an invasion might happen and what should be their response.\n\nMultiple scenes document the early hours of June 6: Allied [[Airborne forces|airborne]] troops being sent in to take key locations inland, away from the beaches, and the French resistance reaction to the news that the invasion has started. Also chronicled are important events surrounding D-Day: British troops' glider missions to secure [[Pegasus Bridge]], the counterattacks launched by American paratroopers scattered around [[Sainte-M\u00e8re-\u00c9glise]], the [[Operation Jedburgh|infiltration and sabotage work]] conducted by the French resistance and [[Special Operations Executive|SOE]] agents, and the response by the ''[[Wehrmacht]]'' to the invasion. Also shown is the uncertainty of German commanders regarding whether this is a feint in preparation for Allied crossings at the [[Strait of Dover]] (see [[Operation Fortitude]]), where the senior German staff had always assumed that the invasion would begin.\n\nSet-piece scenes include the parachute drop into Sainte-M\u00e8re-\u00c9glise, the advance inshore from the Normandy beaches, the U.S. [[Provisional Ranger Group]]'s assault on the [[Pointe du Hoc]], the attack on [[Ouistreham]] by [[Free French Forces]], and the strafing of the beaches by two lone ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' pilots. The film concludes with a montage showing various Allied units consolidating their beachheads before they advance inland by crossing France to eventually reach Germany.\n\n==Cast==\n''Note: Characters listed in order of rank.''\n\n===American===\n{|style=\"width:70%\" class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:175px\"| Actor\n!Role\n!Notes\n|-\n|[[Henry Grace]]<br>(dubbed by [[Allen Swift]])\n|[[General (United States)|Gen.]] [[Dwight D.

After finishing ''[[The Truth (1960 film)|The Truth]]'', L\u00e9vy set up a deal with the [[Associated British Picture Corporation]] and got director [[Michael Anderson (director)|Michael Anderson]] attached. Ryan would receive $100,000, plus $35,000 to write the adaptation's screenplay. L\u00e9vy intended to start production in March 1961, filming at [[Elstree Studios (Shenley Road)|Elstree Studios]] and the English and French coasts. But the project went into a halt once ABPC could not get the $6 million budget L\u00e9vy expected. Eventually, former [[20th Century Fox]] mogul [[Darryl F. Zanuck]] learned about the book while producing ''[[The Big Gamble (1961 film)|The Big Gamble]]'', and in December purchased L\u00e9vy's option for $175,000.{{sfn|Rubin|2011|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=uHNvAeD4yR4C&pg=PA93 91]}} Zanuck's editor friend [[Elmo Williams]] wrote a [[film treatment]], which piqued the producer's interest and made him attach Williams to ''The Longest Day'' as associate producer and coordinator of battle episodes. Ryan was brought in to write the script, but had conflicts with Zanuck as soon as the two met. Williams was forced to act as a mediator; he would deliver Ryan's script pages to Zanuck, then return them with the latter's annotations.{{sfn|Williams|2006|pp=138\u2013140}} While Ryan developed the script, Zanuck also brought in other writers for cleanups for the various nationalities, including [[James Jones (author)|James Jones]] for the Americans, [[Romain Gary]] for the French, [[No\u00ebl Coward]] for the British and [[Erich Maria Remarque]] for the Germans.<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Oulhan | first=Richard Jr. |title=The Longest Headache |magazine=LIFE |date=15 Oct 1962 |page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=fVUEAAAAMBAJ&pg=RA1-PA118&lpg=RA1-PA118 116]}}</ref> As their contributions to the finished screenplay were relatively minor, Ryan managed to get the screenplay credit after an appeal to the [[Writers Guild of America, West|Writers Guild]] [[WGA screenwriting credit system|arbitration]],{{sfn|Lev|2013|p=234}} but the four other writers are credited for \"additional scenes\" in the closing credits.\n\nDuring pre-production, producer [[Frank McCarthy (producer)|Frank McCarthy]], who had worked for the [[United States Department of War]] during World War II, arranged for military collaboration with the governments of France, Germany, the United Kingdom and the United States. Zanuck, who was friends with Supreme Allied Commander [[Lauris Norstad]], secured 700 [[United States Army Europe and Africa]] soldiers for use as extras. However, hundreds of these soldiers had to be recalled after the [[Berlin Crisis of 1961]], and many Members of Congress such as [[Bob Wilson (politician)|Bob Wilson]] criticized the military for transferring soldiers to a film production in France during a major [[Cold War]] standoff. The Senate Subcommittee on Constitutional Rights under [[Sam Ervin]] investigated the film for allegly forcing soldiers to appear as extras against their will. In the end the film included 250 [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] soldiers and 500 [[British Army]] soldiers as extras.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nZanuck also realized that with eight battle scenes, shooting would be accomplished more expediently if multiple directors and units worked simultaneously, so he hired German directors [[Gerd Oswald]] and [[Bernhard Wicki]], British director [[Ken Annakin]], and Hungarian-American director [[Andrew Marton]].{{sfn|Rubin|2011|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=uHNvAeD4yR4C&pg=PA93 93]}} Zanuck's son [[Richard D. Zanuck]] was reluctant about the project, particularly the high budget.{{sfn|Gussow|1971|pp=198\u2013199}}\n\n===Filming===\n* The film was shot at several French locations including the [[\u00cele de R\u00e9]], Saleccia beach in [[Saint-Florent, Haute-Corse]], [[Port-en-Bessin-Huppain]] filling in for [[Ouistreham]], Les Studios de Boulogne in [[Boulogne-Billancourt]], and the actual locations of [[Pegasus Bridge]] near [[B\u00e9nouville, Calvados]], [[Sainte-M\u00e8re-\u00c9glise]], and [[Pointe du Hoc]].<ref name=\"Presse\">{{cite news |newspaper=La Presse de la Manche |title=Notre jour le plus long |trans-title=Our longest day |location=Cherbourg, France |year=2012}}</ref>\n* During the filming of the landings at Omaha Beach, the extras appearing as American soldiers did not want to jump off the landing craft into the water because they thought that it would be too cold. [[Robert Mitchum]] as Gen. [[Norman Cota]] became disgusted with their trepidation. He jumped in first, at which point they followed his example.\n* The [[paradummy|Rupert paradummies]] used in the film were far more elaborate and lifelike than those actually used in the decoy parachute drop ([[Operation Titanic]]), which were simply canvas or burlap sacks filled with sand. The dummies dressed in American jumpsuits were used in filming the Sainte-M\u00e8re-\u00c9glise sequence.<ref name=\"Presse\"/> In the real operation, six [[Special Air Service]] soldiers jumped with the dummies and played recordings of loud battle noises to distract the Germans.\n* With a budget of $10 million (${{Formatprice|{{Inflation|US|10000000|1962}}}} in {{inflation-year|US}} dollars), this was the most expensive black-and-white film made until 1993, when ''[[Schindler's List]]'' was released.<ref name=TIME-1962-10-19/>\n* In the scenes where the paratroopers land, the background noise of frogs croaking was incorrect for northern French frog species and showed that the film probably used an American recording of background night noises.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}}\n* [[Colin Maud]] lent [[Kenneth More]] the actual [[Shillelagh (club)|shillelagh]] that he carried ashore in the invasion. (More had served as an officer in the Royal Navy during World War II, albeit not as a Beachmaster.) Similarly, [[Richard Todd]] wears the beret that he actually wore on D-Day, although he changed the cap-badge to that of [[John Howard (British Army officer)|Maj. John Howard]]'s regiment, the [[Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire Light Infantry]].\n* In the film, three [[Free French]] Special Air Service paratroopers jump into France before British and American airborne landings. This is accurate. Thirty-six Free French SAS (4 sticks) jumped into Brittany ([[Plumelec]] and [[Duault]]) on June 5 at 23:30 ([[operation Dingson]]). The first Allied soldiers killed in action were Lt. [[Den Brotheridge]] of the 2nd Ox & Bucks Light Infantry as he crossed Pegasus Bridge at 00:22 on June 6, and Corporal Emile Bou\u00e9tard of the 4th Free French SAS battalion at the same time in Plumelec, [[Brittany]].\n* The [[United States Sixth Fleet]] extensively supported the filming and made available many amphibious landing ships and craft for scenes filmed in Corsica, though many of the ships were of newer vintage. The {{USS|Springfield|CL-66|2}} and {{USS|Little Rock|CL-92|2}} were World War II light cruisers extensively reconfigured into [[guided missile cruisers]], and both were used in the shore bombardment scenes.  While the USS Springfield was scrapped in 1980, the USS Little Rock is now a museum ship in Buffalo,  New York. \n*The film shows the attack by the 2nd Ranger Battalion on the Point de Hoc.  The actual landings were slightly further east than shown in the film owing to strong tides and high seas.  When entering the bunker, one soldier says the guns were never installed.  This is inaccurate as the 155mm guns had been in position until a few days before D-Day but were moved due to heavy bombing.  The guns were discovered hidden a few hours later and destroyed. \n* [[Gerd Oswald]] was the uncredited director of the parachute drop scenes into Sainte-M\u00e8re-\u00c9glise. [[Darryl F. Zanuck]] said that he himself directed some uncredited pick-ups with American and British interiors.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite web |url=http://www.afi.com/members/catalog/DetailView.aspx?s=&Movie=23731 |title=The Longest Day |work=[[American Film Institute]] |year=2015 |access-date=April 5, 2015 |archive-date=February 19, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150219140240/http://www.afi.com/members/catalog/DetailView.aspx?s=&Movie=23731 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n* [[Elmo Williams]] was credited as associate producer and coordinator of battle episodes.

However, it was decided that makeup artists couldn't make him appear young enough to play his World War II self. The role of Gen. Eisenhower went to [[Henry Grace]], a set decorator with no acting experience but who had been in the film industry since the mid-1930s. He was a dead ringer for the younger Eisenhower, though his voice differed and is dubbed in the film.\n* The film marked the last film appearance of [[Sean Connery]] before he was cast in the role of [[James Bond]]. [[Gert Fr\u00f6be]] (Sgt. Kaffeekanne) and [[Curd J\u00fcrgens]] (Gen. [[G\u00fcnther Blumentritt]]) later played Bond villains [[Auric Goldfinger]] (''[[Goldfinger (film)|Goldfinger (1964)]]'') and [[Karl Stromberg]] (''[[The Spy Who Loved Me (film)|The Spy Who Loved Me]]'') respectively. Connery played Maj. Gen. [[Roy Urquhart]] in the 1977 film ''[[A Bridge Too Far (film)|A Bridge Too Far]]'', which was also based on a [[A Bridge Too Far (book)|book]] by Cornelius Ryan. Likewise, [[Wolfgang Preiss]] played Maj. Gen.
