[[Hugh Grant]] stars as Michael Felgate, an [[English people|English]] auctioneer living in [[New York City]] who becomes entangled in his soon-to-be father-in-law's [[American Mafia|mafia]] connections. Several of the minor roles are played by actors later featured in ''[[The Sopranos]]''.\n\nThe film's title comes from Michael being forced to impersonate a gangster, who is spontaneously named \"Kansas City Little Big Mickey Blue Eyes\"; coincidentally, it is also a play on \"Jimmy Blue Eyes,\" nickname of real-life mobster [[Vincent Alo]]. Later on, the film served as an inspiration for 2007 [[Bollywood]] film ''[[Welcome (2007 film)|Welcome]]''.\n\nThe film was released on August 20, 1999. It received mixed reviews from critics and grossed $57 million against its $36 million budget.\n\n==Plot==\nMichael Felgate is an [[English people|English]] [[auction]]eer living in [[New York City]] where he manages the Cromwell auction house. He proposes marriage to his girlfriend Gina Vitale, but is disheartened to be turned down. Gina tearfully explains that her father Frank and most of her cousins and uncles are gangsters deeply involved in a [[American Mafia|Mafia]] crime family, and she is concerned that Michael will be forced into their world. Michael assures her that he will not let this happen, but barely is their engagement party over before he is unwittingly involved in a [[money laundering]] scam, and soon the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] takes an interest in him.\n\nWhen one of the money laundering scams at Michael's auction house goes wrong, Gina's cousin Johnny confronts and attacks Michael. Gina takes his gun and fires a warning shot into the ceiling, which ricochets and accidentally kills Johnny. Johnny's father Vito finds out, and he tells Frank he will kill Gina unless Frank kills Michael during his wedding speech. Having grown fond of Michael, Frank confesses what Vito has ordered him to do to Michael and the two of them turn to the FBI in return for protection. The FBI set up an elaborate operation in which Michael's execution will be faked at the wedding reception. Michael is given a hidden recording device and is tasked with trying to record Vito into admitting his criminal activity on tape before he is \"executed\".\n\nMichael's plan fails, and when Vito realises that his execution is a set-up, he orders Vinnie to kill Michael. Vinnie shoots Gina in what appears to be an accident. Vito is arrested for ordering Michael's execution. As Frank and Michael mourn Gina's apparent death in the back of her ambulance, it is revealed that her death was faked as well, and that Vinnie and Gina were also involved with the FBI as a back-up plan.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Hugh Grant]] as Michael Felgate\n* [[James Caan]] as Frank Vitale\n* [[Jeanne Tripplehorn]] as Gina Vitale\n* [[Burt Young]] as Vito Graziosi\n* [[James Fox]] as Philip Cromwell\n* [[Joe Viterelli]] as Vinnie D'Agostino\n* [[Gerry Becker]] as FBI Agent Bob Connell\n* [[Maddie Corman]] as Carol\n* [[Tony Darrow]] as Angelo\n* Paul Lazar as Ritchie Vitale\n* [[Tony Sirico]] as First Risolli Man\n* [[Vincent Pastore]] as Al\n* [[Frank Pellegrino (actor)|Frank Pellegrino]] as Sante\n* [[Scott Thompson (comedian)|Scott Thompson]] as FBI Agent Lewis\n* [[John Ventimiglia]] as Johnny Graziosi\n* Margaret Devine as Helen\n* [[Beatrice Winde]] as Mrs. Horton\n* [[Aida Turturro]] as Italian Waitress\n* [[Joseph R.
