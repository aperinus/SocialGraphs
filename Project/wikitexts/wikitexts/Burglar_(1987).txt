Things take a turn for the worse when Christopher is murdered while Bernie is robbing his home, and thanks to Sheldrake and her lawyer Carson, Bernie is the only suspect.\n\nTo clear her name Bernice and her friend Carl hop from bar to bar looking for someone who knew Christopher. They find out that Christopher had quite a few girlfriends... and boyfriends. Bernice has three new suspects after an old flame of Christopher's tells her about an artist, a bartender, and a mysterious man known only by his nickname: \"Heeeeeeere's Johnny!\"\n\nBernice investigates the artist and the bartender only to have them show up dead. With no clues or witnesses, Bernice waits for Dr. Sheldrake in her home to confront her. Demanding she tell her everything she knew about Christopher, she concludes that Cynthia herself had sex with her ex the night he was murdered.\n\nDuring the conversation the TV flashes to an episode of ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson]]''. Bernice realizes Carson knew the doctor's ex. Bernice calls Carson to meet her in the park with the bag of jewelry Bernice was commissioned to steal in the first place. Bernice has also deduced that Carson was in love with Christopher himself. A scuffle ensues and Bernice, along with her friend Carl and Ray, capture Carson.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Whoopi Goldberg]] as [[Bernie Rhodenbarr|Bernice \"Bernie\" Rhodenbarr]]\n* [[Bobcat Goldthwait]] as Carl Hefler\n* [[G.

(The film was based on the second of a long-running series of novels about a professional burglar, Bernard \"Bernie\" Rhodenbar.) When Willis dropped out, Goldberg took on the lead role.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.smodcast.com/episodes/jeph-loeb-the-long-interview-about-the-long-halloween-part-1/ |title=SModcast &#124; Jeph Loeb: The Long Interview About the Long Halloween, Part 1 |access-date=2016-09-08 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151120053512/http://www.smodcast.com/episodes/jeph-loeb-the-long-interview-about-the-long-halloween-part-1/ |archive-date=2015-11-20 }}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\nCritical reception was largely negative. [[Roger Ebert]] described the film as \"a witless, hapless exercise in the wrong way to package Goldberg. This is a woman who is original. Who is talented. Who has a special relationship with the motion picture comedy. It is criminal to put her into brain-damaged, assembly-line thrillers.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/burglar-1987|title=Burglar Movie Review & Film Summary (1987)|first=Roger|last=Ebert|website=Rogerebert.com|access-date=10 March 2019}}</ref> On [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film has an aggregate score of 27% based on 3 positive and 8 negative critic reviews.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Burglar |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1003276-burglar |access-date=September 2, 2022 |website=Rotten Tomatoes}}</ref> \n\n==See also==\n* [[List of American films of 1987]]\n* [[List of Nelvana franchises]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{wikiquote}}\n* {{IMDb title|0092710|title=Burglar}}\n* {{Amg movie|7573|Burglar}}\n* {{Mojo title|burglar}}\n* {{rotten-tomatoes|1003276-burglar}}\n\n{{Hugh Wilson}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Burglar (Film)}}\n[[Category:1987 films]]\n[[Category:1980s crime comedy films]]\n[[Category:1987 LGBT-related films]]\n[[Category:American LGBT-related films]]\n[[Category:American crime comedy films]]\n[[Category:English-language Canadian films]]\n[[Category:1980s English-language films]]\n[[Category:Films based on American novels]]\n[[Category:Films based on crime novels]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Hugh Wilson]]\n[[Category:Warner Bros. films]]\n[[Category:Films set in San Francisco]]\n[[Category:Films set in the San Francisco Bay Area]]\n[[Category:Films shot in San Francisco]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Sylvester Levay]]\n[[Category:Nelvana films]]\n[[Category:Canadian comedy films]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by Hugh Wilson]]\n[[Category:1987 comedy films]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by Jeph Loeb]]\n[[Category:1980s American films]]\n[[Category:1980s Canadian films]]"}]}}}}
