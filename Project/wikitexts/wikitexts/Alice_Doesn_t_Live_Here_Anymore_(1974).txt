[[Kris Kristofferson]], [[Billy \"Green\" Bush]], [[Diane Ladd]], [[Valerie Curtin]], [[Lelia Goldoni]], [[Vic Tayback]], [[Jodie Foster]], [[Alfred Lutter]] and [[Harvey Keitel]] are featured in supporting roles.<ref name=\"Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore\"/>\n\nThe film premiered at the [[1974 Cannes Film Festival|27th Cannes Film Festival]], where it competed for the ''[[Palme d'Or]]'', and was released theatrically on December 9, 1974, by [[Warner Bros.]] The film was a critical and commercial success, grossing $21 million on a $1.8 million budget. At the [[47th Academy Awards]], Burstyn won [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]], while Ladd and Getchell received nominations for [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]] and [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay|Best Original Screenplay]].\n\n== Plot ==\nWhen in [[Socorro, New Mexico]], housewife [[Alice Hyatt]]'s husband, Donald, is killed in an auto accident, she decides to have a garage sale, pack what's left of her meager belongings, and take her precocious son Tommy to her childhood hometown of [[Monterey, California]], where she hopes to pursue the singing career she abandoned when she married.\n\nTheir financial situation forces them to take temporary lodgings in [[Phoenix, Arizona]], where she finds work as a lounge singer in a seedy bar. There she meets Ben, who is younger and uses his boyish charm to lure her into a sexual relationship that comes to a sudden end when his wife, Rita, confronts Alice. Ben breaks into Alice's apartment while Rita is there and physically assaults her in front of Alice for interfering with his extramarital affair. When Alice tells Ben to calm down, he also threatens her and continues to smash up the apartment. Fearing for their safety (and unable to afford repairs), Alice and Tommy quickly leave town.\n\nHaving spent most of the little money she earned on a new wardrobe, Alice is forced to delay her journey to the West Coast and accept a job as a waitress in [[Tucson, Arizona|Tucson]] so she can accumulate more cash. At the local diner, owned by a man named Mel, she eventually bonds with her fellow servers \u2013 independent, no-nonsense, outspoken Flo and quiet, timid, incompetent Vera \u2013 and meets divorced local rancher David, who is instantly attracted to Alice on her first day at Mel's diner. David soon realizes the way to Alice's heart is through Tommy.\n\nAlice is initially hesitant to get involved with another man so quickly. However, she finds out that David is a good influence on Tommy, who has befriended wisecracking, shoplifting, [[Flavored fortified wine#Brands|Ripple]]-guzzling Audrey, a slightly older girl forced to fend for herself while her mother makes a living as a prostitute.\n\nAlice warily falls in love with David but their relationship is threatened when Alice objects to his discipline of the perpetually bratty Tommy. The two reconcile, and David offers to sell his ranch and move to Monterey so Alice can try to fulfil her childhood dream of becoming another [[Alice Faye]]. In the end, Alice decides to stay in Tucson, coming to the conclusion that she can become a singer anywhere.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Ellen Burstyn]] as [[Alice Hyatt]] (n\u00e9e Graham), a woman in her thirties who once worked as a singer\n** Mia Bendixsen as 8-year-old Alice\n* [[Alfred Lutter]] as Tommy Hyatt, Alice's obnoxious preteen son\n* [[Kris Kristofferson]] as David, a regular customer of Mel and Ruby's Cafe\n* [[Billy \"Green\" Bush]] as Donald Hyatt, a truck driver, Alice's husband\n* [[Diane Ladd]] as Florence Jean (\"Flo\") Castleberry, a hardened, sharp-tongued waitress\n* [[Valerie Curtin]] as Vera Gorman, a shy, awkward waitress\n* [[Lelia Goldoni]] as Bea, Alice's friend and neighbor in Socorro\n* [[Lane Bradbury]] as Rita\n* [[Vic Tayback]] as Mel Sharples, a short-order cook who owns the diner\n* [[Jodie Foster]] as Audrey, a tomboyish girl with delinquent tendencies\n* [[Harvey Keitel]] as Ben, a hot-tempered man who assembles gun ammunition for a living\n* Murray Moston as Jacobs\n* [[Harry Northup]] as Joe & Jim's bartender\n\nDirector [[Martin Scorsese]] cameoed as a customer while [[Diane Ladd]]'s daughter, future actress [[Laura Dern]], appears as the little girl eating ice cream from a cone in the diner.\n\n==Production==\nThe part of Alice was originally offered to [[Shirley MacLaine]].<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dvGADAAAQBAJ&q=shirley%20maclaine%20alice%20doesnt%20live%20here%20anymore&pg=PA98|last=Grist|first=Leighton|title=The Films of Martin Scorsese, 1963-77: Authorship and Context|year=2000|publisher=Springer|isbn=9780230286146}}page 98</ref> MacLaine turned down the role.<ref>{{cite news|last=Foerster|first=Jonathan|title=Shirley MacLaine isn't getting old, she's just advanced|date=9 February 2011|newspaper=[[Naples Daily News]]|url=http://archive.naplesnews.com/entertainment/shirley-maclaine-isnt-getting-old-shes-just-advanced-ep-392244535-334584291.html/|access-date=27 June 2017}}</ref>  MacLaine admitted in a 2005 interview that she regretted this decision.<ref>{{cite news|last=Modderno|first=Craig|title=Shirley MacLaine's Words of Wisdom|date=16 October 2005|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/10/16/movies/shirley-maclaines-words-of-wisdom.html|access-date=27 June 2017}}</ref>\n\n[[Ellen Burstyn]] was still in the midst of filming ''[[The Exorcist (film)|The Exorcist]]'' when [[Warner Bros.]] executives expressed interest in working with her on another project. Burstyn later recalled, \"It was early in the woman's movement, and we were all just waking up and having a look at the pattern of our lives and wanting it to be different... I wanted to make a different kind of film. A film from a woman's point of view, but a woman that I recognized, that I knew. And not just myself, but my friends, what we were all going through at the time. So my agent found ''Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore''... When I read it I liked it a lot. I sent it to Warner Brothers and they agreed to do it. Then they asked who I wanted to direct it. I said that I didn't know, but I wanted somebody new and young and exciting. I called [[Francis Ford Coppola|Francis Coppola]] and asked who was young and exciting and he said 'Go look at a movie called ''[[Mean Streets]]'' and see what you think.' It hadn't been released yet, so I booked a screening to look at it and I felt that it was exactly what...''Alice'' needed, because [it] was a wonderful script and well written, but for my taste it was a little slick. You know \u2013 in a good way, in a kind of [[Doris Day]]\u2013[[Rock Hudson]] kind of way. I wanted something a bit more gritty.\"<ref name=TCM>[http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title.jsp?stid=16175&category=Articles Turner Classic Movies]</ref>\n\nBurstyn described her collaboration with director Martin Scorsese, making his first Hollywood studio production,<ref>{{cite news|url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/1479/Alice-Doesn-t-Live-Here-Anymore/overview |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013025029/http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/1479/Alice-Doesn-t-Live-Here-Anymore/overview |url-status=dead |archive-date=2007-10-13 |title=''All Movie Guide'' overview |department=Movies & TV Dept. |work=[[The New York Times]] |author=Lucia Bozzola |date=2007 |access-date=2011-05-06}}</ref> as \"one of the best experiences I've ever had\". The director agreed with his star that the film should have a message. \"It's a picture about emotions and feelings and relationships and people in chaos,\" he said. \"We felt like charting all that and showing the differences and showing people making terrible mistakes ruining their lives and then realizing it and trying to push back when everything is crumbling \u2013 without getting into [[soap opera]]. We opened ourselves up to a lot of experimentation.\"<ref name=TCM />\n\nScorsese's casting director auditioned 300 boys for the role of Tommy before they discovered [[Alfred Lutter]]. \"I met the kid in my hotel room and he was kind of quiet and shy,\" Scorsese said. But when he paired him with Burstyn and suggested she deviate from the script, he held his own. \"Usually, when we were improvising with the kids, they would either freeze and look down or go right back to the script. But this kid, you couldn't shut him up.\"<ref name=TCM />\n\nThe film was shot on location predominantly in and around Tucson, but some scenes were shot in [[Amado, Arizona|Amado]], and Phoenix. A [[Mel's Diner]] still exists in Phoenix.<ref name=TCM />\n\nThe [[soundtrack]] includes \"[[All the Way from Memphis]]\" by [[Mott the Hoople]]; \"[[Leon Russell (album)|Roll Away the Stone]]\" by [[Leon Russell]]; \"[[Daniel (Elton John song)|Daniel]]\" by [[Elton John]]; [[Jeepster (song)|\"Jeepster\"]] by [[T.Rex (band)|T-Rex]]; and \"[[I Will Always Love You]]\" by [[Dolly Parton]]. During her lounge act, Alice sings \"[[Where or When]]\" by [[Richard Rodgers]] and [[Lorenz Hart]]; \"[[When Your Lover Has Gone]]\" by [[Einar Aaron Swan]]; [[Gone with the Wind (song)|\"Gone with the Wind\"]] by [[Allie Wrubel]] and [[Herb Magidson]]; and \"[[I've Got a Crush on You]]\" by [[George Gershwin|George]] and [[Ira Gershwin]].
