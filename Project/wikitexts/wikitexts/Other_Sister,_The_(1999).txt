It was filmed in [[Long Beach, California|Long Beach]], [[Pasadena, California|Pasadena]], and [[San Francisco|San Francisco, California]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0123209/locations|title=The Other Sister (1999)|work=IMDb}}</ref> The film was written by Marshall, Bob Brunner and [[Malia Scotch Marmo]] (uncredited).\n\n==Plot==\nAfter receiving a well-earned certification from a [[Special education|sheltered boarding school]], Carla Tate, an ambitious and mildly [[Developmental disability|mentally disabled]] young woman, returns home to her overprotective and slightly snobby mother Elizabeth. Elizabeth seems to behave as if she is embarrassed about her youngest daughter's disability. During family discussions, Elizabeth adopts an uneasy attitude because her daughter was humiliated by those mean people as a child. Carla's father Radley is a dentist and recovering alcoholic. Carla's ambition is to seek more independence from her family by earning a diploma from a polytechnic school. When Carla meets another mentally disabled student, Daniel McMahon (nicknamed \"Danny\"), they become friends and soon fall in love together. Envying Danny's freedom, Carla convinces her parents she is capable of living on her own and moves into her own [[apartment]]. After a time, Carla and Danny become sexually active together.\n\nDanny's independence is financially compromised when his wealthy and emotionally detached father abruptly stops sending subsistence money. Danny begins to realize that the independence he enjoyed comes with a staggering cost. Danny gets drunk, then seeks solace and insight (and a joyride in a vintage [[Ford Mustang]] convertible) from his landlord and friend, Ernie.\n\nDuring a Christmas party at the country club, nervous about his personal lot, Danny drinks too much to build up his courage to declare his love for Carla. He also tells everyone about their first time [[sexual intercourse|making love]]. A humiliated Carla bursts into tears, screaming at everyone to stop laughing at her. Although Daniel did not intend to embarrass Carla, she nonetheless refuses to see him. Over time, Carla realizes she still loves Danny and wants to see him again despite her mother's advising her otherwise. At her older sister Caroline's [[wedding]], Danny surprises Carla by showing up at the church and asks her to marry him, in a scene mimicking ''[[The Graduate]]'', the couple's favorite film, to which she accepts.\n \nEveryone supports their wishes except Elizabeth, who is unsure Danny can take care of himself, let alone Carla. Carla angrily tells her mother off that she is sick of her combination of three behaviors: dominance, negativity, and doubt. Also, Carla is sick of her mother constantly treating her like two things at once: an embarrassment and a handicap. Radley and her sisters, Heather and Caroline, support her decision, and the wedding is planned. At first, Elizabeth is determined not to attend, but Radley admonishes her. He said that he will walk Carla down the aisle. Finally, after realizing how selfish she has been behaving, Elizabeth relents. Outside the church, Danny surprises Carla with their school's marching band playing \"[[76 Trombones]]\" from ''[[The Music Man]]'', and they are chauffeured away to their honeymoon in Ernie's prized Mustang.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Juliette Lewis]] as Carla Tate\n** Kendra Krull as Young Carla\n* [[Diane Keaton]] as Elizabeth Tate\n* [[Tom Skerritt]] as Dr. Radley Tate\n* [[Giovanni Ribisi]] as Daniel \"Danny\" McMahon\n* [[Poppy Montgomery]] as Caroline Tate\n** Brooke Garrett as Young Caroline\n* [[Sarah Paulson]] as Heather Tate\n** Brighton McCloskey as Young Heather\n* [[Linda Thorson]] as Drew Evanson\n* [[Joe Flanigan]] as Jeff Reed\n* [[Juliet Mills]] as Winnie the Housekeeper\n* [[Tracy Reiner]] as Michelle\n* [[Hector Elizondo]] as Ernie\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Soundtrack==\n{{Infobox album\n| name       = The Other Sister\n| type       = Soundtrack\n| artist     = Various Artists\n| cover      =\n| caption    = \n| alt        =\n| released   = February 23, 1999\n| recorded   = \n| venue      =\n| studio     = \n| genre      = \n| length     = 46:41\n| label      = Hollywood Records\n| producer   = Kathy Nelson\n}}\n\n{{Album ratings\n| rev1      = [[Allmusic]]\n| rev1Score = {{Rating|3|5}} <ref name=AM>{{AllMusic|class=album|id=mw0000048130|first=Leslie|last=Mathew}}</ref>}}\n\n''The Other Sister: Music from the Motion Picture'' was released on February 23, 1999.
