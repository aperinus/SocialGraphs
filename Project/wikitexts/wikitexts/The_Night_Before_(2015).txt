The film stars [[Joseph Gordon-Levitt]], [[Seth Rogen]], and [[Anthony Mackie]] as three childhood friends who annually reunite on [[Christmas Eve]] in search of the best party in [[New York City]]. [[Lizzy Caplan]], [[Jillian Bell]], [[Mindy Kaling]], and [[Michael Shannon]] also star.\n\n[[Principal photography]] began on August 11, 2014, in New York City. [[Good Universe]] and [[Point Grey Pictures]] produced the film, which [[Columbia Pictures]] released in North America on November 20, 2015. The film received mixed reviews from critics and grossed $52 million worldwide.\n\n==Plot==\nIn December 2001, Ethan Miller loses his parents in a car accident. His best friends Isaac Greenberg and Chris Roberts resolve to spend every [[Christmas Eve]] with him so that he will not be alone. The three learn about the exclusive Nutcracker Ball party but are unable to find it. \n\nThey continue their collective holiday tradition for many years until 2015, when they finally decide to end the tradition. Chris, now a famous [[American football|football]] player, and Isaac, married with a baby on the way, worry that Ethan, a struggling musician working dead-end jobs, is not ready for the tradition to end.\n\nAt work, Ethan steals tickets to the Nutcracker Ball. Before embarking on their last Christmas Eve together, the friends meet at Isaac's house where his pregnant wife Betsy gives him various [[illegal drugs]] including [[magic mushroom]]s and [[cocaine]]. \n\nThe friends stop first at the [[Rockefeller Center Christmas Tree]], where Ethan reveals the tickets to the ball. In an attempt to impress his teammates, Chris purchases [[Cannabis (drug)|marijuana]] from their former high school dealer, Mr. Green. \n\nAt a [[karaoke bar]], the friends run into Diana, who recently broke up with Ethan due to his failure to commit, and her friend Sarah, both of whom are also attending the Nutcracker Ball. Isaac, affected by the drugs he took, records a video phone message confessing that he is terrified of having a child. Chris hooks up with a supposed fan who steals his marijuana.\n\nThe friends contact Mr. Green again, who meets them at Chris' mother's, where they have dinner. She encourages Ethan to make up with Diana, and Isaac realizes he has accidentally switched phones with Sarah when he begins to receive [[sexting|sexts]]. While they search for Isaac's phone, the thief steals Chris' marijuana again. \n\nThe friends split up, as Chris wants his marijuana back, Isaac wants his phone, and Ethan wants to go to the party. Chris fails to recover his marijuana but through the thief learns the true value of his friends. Isaac, hallucinating from a mixture of drugs, meets his wife and her family and vomits during [[Midnight Mass]]. Ethan is beaten by two drunk [[pub crawl]]ing men dressed as [[Santa]] after defending the spirit of Christmas.\n\nMeeting back at a subway station, the tension between the friends explodes as Ethan reveals that he and Isaac know Chris' sudden success is due to [[steroids]], and Chris reveals that he and Isaac think Ethan is lost. \n\nDespite their revelations, the friends go to the Nutcracker Ball. Chris learns that his teammates did not need the marijuana he struggled to obtain, and mock him for a video shot earlier with his friends. Isaac retrieves his phone, learning Sarah never revealed his video message. Ethan finds Diana and spontaneously proposes to her in front of the entire party with [[Miley Cyrus]]. While she accepts publicly, she declines in private, saying that he only proposed out of fear of losing his friends. \n\nAshamed, Ethan goes to the roof where he finds Mr. Green, who reveals that he is the creator and host of the Nutcracker Ball. After experiencing a memory of his friends initiating their yearly ritual, Ethan rejoins Chris and Isaac, who have been thrown out after an altercation with Chris' teammates.\n\nAs morning dawns, the friends reconcile just as Isaac receives a message that Betsy is in labor. Rushing to the hospital in Mr. Green's car, they discover it was a false alarm. Mr. Green is revealed to be an [[angel]], helping the friends in order to [[It's a Wonderful Life|earn his wings]]. Isaac shows his wife the video, and she admits she is also scared about raising their daughter. \n\nThe trio spend Christmas at Isaac's, after which Chris has dinner with his mother and admits to his steroid use. Ethan goes to Diana's, where he apologizes for his behavior and not being ready to commit. Admitting that she has missed him, Diana accepts his request to finally meet her parents.\n\nOne year later, the friends and their loved ones spend Christmas together. Isaac's baby cannot sleep, so the trio [[serenade]] her.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Seth Rogen]]<ref name=\"Rogen-Levitt\" /> as Isaac Greenberg \n* [[Joseph Gordon-Levitt]]<ref name=\"Rogen-Levitt\" /> as Ethan Miller<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl7v8p5KPPw|title=The Night Before - Seth Rogen ( Behind the Scenes )|last=XxPiNkTwiLighTxX|date=August 25, 2014|via=YouTube}}</ref>\n* [[Anthony Mackie]]<ref name=\"Mackie\" /> as Chris Roberts\n* [[Lizzy Caplan]]<ref name=\"Caplan\" /> as Diana, Ethan's ex-girlfriend \n* [[Mindy Kaling]]<ref name=\"Trailer\" /> as Sarah\n* [[Jillian Bell]]<ref name=\"Bell\" /> as Betsy Greenberg, Isaac's wife\n* [[Michael Shannon]]<ref name=\"Trailer\">{{cite web |url=http://blogs.indiewire.com/theplaylist/watch-xmas-gets-red-band-in-trailer-for-the-night-before-with-seth-rogen-joseph-gordon-levitt-anthony-mackie-20150728 |title=Watch: Xmas Gets Red Band In Trailer For 'The Night Before' With Seth Rogen, Joseph Gordon-Levitt & Anthony Mackie |website=[[Indiewire]] |first=Kevin |last=Jagernauth |date=July 28, 2015 |access-date=October 20, 2015}}</ref> as Mr. Green\n* [[Lorraine Toussaint]]<ref name=Toussaint>{{cite web |url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/caroline-presno/selmas-lorraine-toussaint_b_6203986.html |title=Selma's Lorraine Toussaint on Motherhood, a Childhood of 'Silent, Dark Terror' and Award Season Buzz |website=[[The Huffington Post]] |first=Caroline |last=Presno |date=November 25, 2014 |access-date=October 20, 2015}}</ref> as Mrs. Roberts, Chris's mother\n* [[Jason Mantzoukas]]<ref name=\"jones-mantzoukas\"/> as Bad Santa #1\n* [[Jason Jones (actor)|Jason Jones]]<ref name=\"jones-mantzoukas\">{{cite web|url=http://bedfordandbowery.com/2014/09/watch-jason-mantzoukas-joseph-gordon-levitt-and-jason-jones-celebrate-santacon-early/|title=Watch Jason Mantzoukas, Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Jason Jones Celebrate SantaCon Early}}</ref> as Bad Santa #2\n* [[Ilana Glazer]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XaXhOIzEkUk|title=Seth Rogen Gets In The Holiday Spirit On Our 'The Night Before' Set Visit - MTV News|last=MTV|date=August 11, 2015|via=YouTube}}</ref> as Rebecca Grinch\n* [[Nathan Fielder]]<ref name=\"Trailer\" /> as Joshua\n* [[Tracy Morgan]] as the Narrator/Santa Claus\n* [[Randall Park]] as Ethan's boss\n* [[Hel\u00e9ne Yorke]] as Cindy\n* [[Aaron Hill (actor)|Aaron Hill]] as Tommy Owens\n* [[Baron Davis]] as himself\n* [[James Franco]] as himself\n* [[Miley Cyrus]] as herself\n}}\n\n==Production==\n\n===Development===\nOn February 10, 2014, it was announced that [[Seth Rogen]] and [[Joseph Gordon-Levitt]] would reunite in the film, following ''[[50/50 (2011 film)|50/50]]'', in which they co-starred.
