The film revolves around a [[bachelor party]] that a group of men throw for their friend Rick Gassko (Hanks) on the eve of his wedding and whether he can remain faithful to his fianc\u00e9e Debbie (Kitaen).\n\n==Plot==\nParty animal Rick Gassko ([[Tom Hanks]]), who makes his living as a Catholic-school bus driver, decides to settle down and marry his girlfriend Debbie Thompson ([[Tawny Kitaen]]). After learning the news of the engagement, Rick's shocked friends, led by Jay ([[Adrian Zmed]]), decide to throw him an epic bachelor party. The bride's wealthy, conservative parents are unhappy with her decision, and her father enlists the help of Debbie's ex-boyfriend Cole Whittier ([[Robert Prescott (actor)|Robert Prescott]]) to sabotage her relationship with Rick and win her back.\n\nWhile Debbie worries and goes off to a bridal shower thrown by her friends, Rick heads to the bachelor party, which takes place in a lavish, spacious hotel suite, and promises to remain faithful. Both parties start off on the wrong foot because of Cole's meddling. As the bachelor party starts to heat up, Debbie and the girls decide to get even with Rick and his friends by having a party of their own. Both parties eventually collide, leading to Debbie accusing Rick of infidelity.\n\nThe bachelor party becomes a wild, drunken [[orgy]] and the hotel room is trashed, which infuriates the hotel's frustrated manager (Kenneth Kimmins). Adding to the confusion is Rick's friend Brad, who has become despondent over the breakup of his marriage and botches several [[suicide]] attempts. When Brad tries to slit his wrists with an electric razor, Rick says, \"Well.....at least your wrists will be smooth and kissable.\"\n\nRick convinces Debbie of his love and faithfulness just as the party is raided by the police. In the ensuing melee, Rick and Debbie become separated and Cole kidnaps Debbie, so Rick and his friends chase after them. The chase culminates in a showdown between Rick and Cole in a [[Multiplex (movie theater)|36-screen movie theater]], with a fist fight taking place in synchronization with a similar fight being shown in a [[3D film]] projected behind them; the audience believes that the real fight is an extraordinary 3D effect. Rick wins the fight and is reunited with Debbie.\n\nAfter the wedding, Rick and Debbie are driven to the airport for their honeymoon in Rick's school bus, which is driven by a laughing Brad.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Tom Hanks]] as Richard Ernesto \"Rick\" Gassko\n* [[Tawny Kitaen]] as Deborah Julie \"Debbie\" Thompson\n* [[Adrian Zmed]] as Jay O'Neill\n* [[George Grizzard]] as Ed Thompson\n* [[Barbara Stuart]] as Mrs. Thompson\n* [[Robert Prescott (actor)|Robert Prescott]] as Cole Whittier\n* [[William Tepper]] as Dr. Stanley \"Stan\" Gassko\n* [[Wendie Jo Sperber]] as Dr. Tina Gassko\n* [[Barry Diamond]] as Rudy\n* Tracy Smith as Bobbi\n* Gary Grossman as Gary\n* [[Michael Dudikoff]] as Ryko\n* Gerard Prendergast as Mike\n* [[Deborah Harmon]] as Ilene\n* Kenneth Kimmins as Parkview Hotel Manager\n* [[Rosanne Katon]] as Bridal Shower Hooker\n* [[Christopher Morley (actor)|Christopher Morley]] as She-Tim (cross-dresser)\n* Brett Baxter Clark as Nick (credited as Brett Clark)\n* [[Monique Gabrielle]] as Tracey\n* [[Angela Aames]] as Mrs. Klupner\n* [[Hugh McPhillips]] as Father O'Donnell\n* [[Billy Beck]] as Patient\n* [[Milt Kogan]] as Restaurant Customer\n* [[Pat Proft]] as Screaming Man (Newlywed)\n* [[Tad Horino]] as Japanese Businessman\n* Toni Alessandrini as Miss Desiree, exotic dancer with Max the Magical Sexual Mule\n* Bradford Bancroft as Brad\n* Jessica Meier and Michelle Meier as Timmy Klupner\n{{Div col end}}\n\n===Casting===\n\n[[Jim Carrey]], [[Tim Robbins]], and [[Howie Mandel]] were considered for the role of Rick Gassko.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vulture.com/amp/2011/03/the-lost-roles-of-jim-carrey.html|title=The Lost Roles of Jim Carrey|date=17 March 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Production==\nThe idea for the film came from an actual bachelor party thrown by producer Ron Moler and a group of friends for fellow producer [[Bob Israel (film producer)|Bob Israel]].
