A standalone [[sequel]] to the 2003 film ''[[Bad Santa]]'', the film stars [[Billy Bob Thornton]], [[Tony Cox (actor)|Tony Cox]], [[Brett Kelly (actor)|Brett Kelly]], [[Kathy Bates]], and [[Christina Hendricks]], and features criminals Willie and Marcus again teaming up to work as Santa and an elf, respectively, this time to rob a Chicago charity on Christmas Eve.\n\n[[Principal photography]] began on January 11, 2016, in [[Montreal]], and the film was released in the United States on November 23, 2016, by [[Broad Green Pictures]]. In contrast to the original film, it received generally negative reviews and grossed $24.1 million worldwide against its $26 million budget (less than a third of the original film's $76.5 million), making it a [[Box office bomb|box-office bomb]].\n\n==Plot==\nSet 13 years after the first film, Willie Soke remains depressed as ever, upset his \"happy ending\" did not pan out, as he is again addicted to sex and alcohol. As he tries and fails to kill himself he is visited by Thurman \"The Kid\" Merman, who has just turned 21 and works at a sandwich shop called Hungry Hoagies. Unfortunately, Thurman's father has abandoned him and his grandmother has passed on two years before making Willie the closest thing to family he has left. Thurman delivers to Willie a package containing a large sum of cash, and Willie soon finds out it's from Marcus, his former partner who has been released from jail after the events 13 years earlier. Marcus, expressing sincere remorse for betraying Willie, tells Willie he has an opportunity in [[Chicago]] that can potentially net them millions, though he is unwilling to disclose the name of his contact. Willie reluctantly agrees, while unsuccessfully trying to help Thurman lose his virginity before he leaves for Chicago.\n\nUpon their arrival, Willie is annoyed to learn that not only is a target of the con a charity but that his estranged mother, Sunny, uses \"shit stick\" as a term of endearment for Willie, which is Marcus' contact. Willie reluctantly agrees since Sunny is suffering from the early stages of [[Parkinson's disease|Parkinson's Disease]], though he secretly makes a deal with Marcus to cut Sunny out when the time comes. Forced to don the Santa suit once more, Willie is arrested when he beats up a much jollier Santa (due to mistakenly thinking the other Santa is a pedophile) but is bailed out by one of the charity's founders, Diane. Though she wants to fire Willie for his behavior, she relents when he agrees to attend AA meetings with her. Diane's husband, the Regent, who also runs the charity and is cheating on Diane with his secretary, orders his head security guard Dorfman to track and follow Willie, becoming suspicious of how much time he's spending with Diane.\n\nMeanwhile, Marcus, after doing recon work, tries to seduce security guard Gina so he can obtain the keys to Regent's office where the charity's safe is kept, but he fails to do so, as Gina is \"high maintenance\". Elsewhere, Willie starts a sexual relationship with Diane, and he and Sunny start to bond, especially when the two of them rob a mansion together with Willie posing as Santa and Sunny as Mrs. Claus. As they bond over their haul afterward, Sunny gives Willie a gun so he can betray and take revenge on Marcus, despite Willie's insistence that Marcus has changed.\n\nThurman soon arrives in Chicago, having followed Willie to the city. Willie at first considers leaving him at a laundromat but soon takes him to the shelter at the charity. Thurman ends up joining the children's choir, which is set to have a concert on the night of Willie, Sunny, and Marcus's heist. Willie soon encounters Gina, who, thanks to Sunny's prodding, believes Willie wants to sleep with her. They have sex in the bathroom of a bar, and Willie obtains the keys. On the night of the show/robbery, Willie catches Thurman singing, which makes the kid very happy. As Willie cracks the safe, Marcus is about to betray him again, but they escape just as Regent and Dorfman discover the con. However, Sunny reveals she is betraying them both, telling Willie the bullets in the gun she gave him are blanks before shooting Marcus. She tries to escape by disappearing into a crowd of people dressed as Santa at an outdoor party. Willie, Regent, and Dorfman chase her. Despite blending in, Willie catches her and attempts to take the bag of stolen cash by saying the kids need it more. In their struggle, the bag is torn open and the money goes flying into the crowd. Enraged, Sunny attempts to shoot him again, but hits Thurman in his behind instead. Both Sunny and Willie are arrested, but Willie is not charged due to his help in catching Sunny. While he recovers, he is visited in the hospital by Diane who wakes him up with a [[handjob]].\n\nWillie soon takes a job as a janitor at the charity, where he continues to visit Thurman and accepts him as family. He also visits an injured Marcus, but proceeds to \"[[Teabagging|tea bag]]\" him and post pictures of this on [[Instagram]], as revenge against Marcus for doing the same thing to him.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Billy Bob Thornton]] as Willie Soke<ref name=\"Oct2015TW\" />\n* [[Kathy Bates]] as Sunny Soke<ref name=\"BatesCast\" />\n* [[Tony Cox (actor)|Tony Cox]] as Marcus Skidmore<ref name=\"Nov2015THR\" />\n* [[Christina Hendricks]] as Diane Hastings<ref name=\"HendricksCast\" />\n* [[Brett Kelly (actor)|Brett Kelly]] as Thurman Merman<ref name=\"Nov2015THR\" />\n* [[Ryan Hansen]] as Regent Hastings<ref name=\"Jan2016D\" />\n* [[Jenny Zigrino]] as Gina De Luca<ref name=\"Jan2016D\" />\n* Jeff Skowron as Dorfman<ref name=\"Jan2016D\" />\n* [[Mike Starr (actor)|Mike Starr]] as Jolly Santa\n* [[Octavia Spencer]] as Opal<ref name=\"Jan2016D\" />\n}}\n\n==Production==\nIn 2009, [[Billy Bob Thornton]] first mentioned the sequel to the 2003 film ''[[Bad Santa]]'', with an aim for release at Christmas 2011.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Smith|first1=Chris|title=Billy Bob Thornton finally returns as Bad Santa next November|url=http://bgr.com/2015/12/21/bad-santa-2-release-date/|accessdate=January 14, 2016|work=BGR|date=December 21, 2015}}</ref> On December 16, 2010, it was announced that [[Miramax]] and [[The Weinstein Company]] had signed on an agreement to develop sequels including one for ''Bad Santa''.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Fleming|first1=Mike Jr.|title=Weinsteins And Miramax Strike Sequels Deal|url=https://deadline.com/2010/12/weinsteins-and-miramax-strike-sequels-deal-91260/|accessdate=January 13, 2016|website=Deadline Hollywood|date=December 16, 2010 }}</ref> On March 18, 2011, ''TheWrap'' reported that Weinstein confirmed the sequel and negotiations had begun with Thornton to return for the lead role.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Lang|first1=Brent|title=Exclusive: Billy Bob Thornton in Talks for 'Bad Santa 2'|url=https://www.thewrap.com/movies/column-post/billy-bob-thornton-negotiations-bad-santa-2-25631/|accessdate=January 14, 2016|work=TheWrap|date=March 18, 2011 }}</ref> On July 14, 2011, the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' confirmed that [[Dimension Films]] and other producers on the film, including Geyer Kosinski, had hired two writers Johnny Rosenthal and John Phillips to work on the screenplay.<ref>{{cite news|title='Bad Santa 2': The sequel so anticipated it gets ... two scripts?|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/movies/2011/07/bad-santa-2-sequel-billy-bob-thornton-willie-stokes-dimension.html|accessdate=January 14, 2016|work=LA Times Blogs - 24 Frames|date=July 14, 2011 }}</ref> The sequel was scheduled to begin shooting in fall 2012 for a December 2013 release.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Jagernauth|first1=Kevin|title=Billy Bob Thornton Says 'Bad Santa 2' Will Shoot This Fall For Christmas 2013 Release;
