Released by [[HBO Films|HBO Pictures]] and produced in conjunction with [[The Montecito Picture Company|Northern Lights Entertainment]], the film premiered on [[HBO]] on February 24, 1996.\n\nBased on Carter's 1994 [[The Late Shift (book)|book of the same name]], the film chronicles the [[late-night talk show|late-night television]] conflict between [[Jay Leno]] and [[David Letterman]] in the early 1990s, surrounding [[NBC]]'s appointment of Leno to succeed [[Johnny Carson]] as host of ''[[The Tonight Show]]'', and ''[[Late Night with David Letterman|Late Night]]'' host Letterman's resulting efforts to negotiate out of his contract with the network to host his own [[Late Show with David Letterman|competing talk show]] for [[CBS]].\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1991, behind-the-scenes network politics embroil television executives responsible for [[NBC]]'s late-night programming. [[Johnny Carson]] has hosted ''[[The Tonight Show]]'' for decades, but he and his audience are both growing older, leaving NBC to anticipate the day when a new host will be needed. Carson's permanent guest host, [[Jay Leno]], and the host of [[Late Night with David Letterman|the show]] that follows Carson's each night, [[David Letterman]], both vie for Carson's job. It is widely assumed that Letterman is the hand-picked heir apparent whom Carson favors, but NBC executives privately speculate that Leno could be more popular with audiences in the 11:30&nbsp;p.m. ([[Eastern Time Zone|ET]]/[[Pacific Time Zone|PT]]) slot, as well as easier for the network to control. They also would not have to deal with Letterman's stipulation for ownership rights to the show.\n\nLeno's manager, [[Helen Kushnick]], secures the spot for Leno with negotiating tactics that could be construed as either shrewd or unethical. Leno is concerned that her methods might alienate Carson, but does not wish to be disloyal as he believes that she has been responsible for his success; in addition, he had promised to take care of her after her husband's death. Kushnick harshly instructs Leno to just keep telling jokes and leave the business end to her. Surely enough, Kushnick secures the producer's position for herself at ''The Tonight Show'', on the condition that no public announcement will be made. Letterman continues to believe he is still in contention for the position.\n\nIn the spring of 1991, Carson unexpectedly announces his retirement, effective in one year. NBC executives inform an angry Letterman they have selected Leno to replace Carson. Leno takes over in May 1992, but Kushnick's bullying manner angers his colleagues, potential guests, and others to the point of interfering with network airtime and relationships. NBC executives warn the mild-mannered Leno that they are going to fire Kushnick and, if he sides with her, he will be let go as well. Kushnick is dismissed by NBC and barred from the studio lot. Despite Kushnick's pleas to keep his promise to take care of her and her daughter, Leno is angry because she nearly cost him a dream job. After a heated argument, Leno fires Kushnick and ends their friendship. Later, Leno eavesdrops on an executive meeting in which NBC executives discuss the possibility of replacing him with Letterman.\n\nLetterman, devastated at being passed over, hires Hollywood superagent [[Michael Ovitz]] to negotiate on his behalf; Ovitz promises that not only will Letterman be offered an 11:30&nbsp;p.m. show, he will be offered it by every network. True to Ovitz's word, Letterman is courted by all the major networks and [[television syndication|syndicates]]. He provisionally accepts an offer from [[CBS]] that gives him an 11:30&nbsp;p.m show, but continues to hold on to his lifelong dream of hosting ''The Tonight Show.'' Per Letterman's contract with NBC, the network still has several months to either match CBS's offer or present an acceptable counteroffer to keep Letterman. Producer [[Peter Lassally]], close to both Carson and Letterman, finally convinces NBC to offer Letterman the ''Tonight Show'' position. However, NBC's offer is substantially weaker than CBS's and would force Letterman to wait until May 1994 to take over the show. Lassally, disappointed at NBC's offer, makes it clear to Letterman that the ''Tonight Show'' job is now \"damaged goods\" and Dave would be working with the very people who passed him over and may yet double-cross him. In addition, Lassally warns Letterman that he will be vilified in the press for forcing Leno out.\n\nTaking Lassally's suggestion, Letterman calls Carson to ask for advice; Carson says he would probably leave NBC if he were in Letterman's position. Letterman rejects NBC's counteroffer and accepts CBS's offer to host [[Late Show with David Letterman|his own 11:30 show]] beginning in the fall of 1993. Letterman and Leno ultimately go head to head at 11:30, with Letterman initially winning in the TV ratings in the beginning, before Leno firmly re-establishes ''The Tonight Show''{{'}}s dominance.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Kathy Bates]] as [[Helen Kushnick]]\n* [[John Michael Higgins]] as [[David Letterman]]\n* [[Daniel Roebuck]] as [[Jay Leno]]\n* [[Bob Balaban]] as [[Warren Littlefield]]\n* [[Ed Begley, Jr.]] as Rod Perth\n* [[Peter Jurasik]] as [[Howard Stringer]]\n* [[Reni Santoni]] as [[John Agoglia]]\n* [[John Kapelos]] as [[Robert Morton (producer)|Robert Morton]]\n* [[Steven Gilborn]] as [[Peter Lassally]]\n* [[John Getz]] as [[Brandon Tartikoff]]\n* [[Lawrence Pressman]] as [[Bob Wright]]\n* [[Sandra Bernhard]] as Herself\n* [[Treat Williams]] as [[Michael Ovitz]]\n* Paul Elder as [[Rupert Murdoch]]\n* [[Michael Fairman]] as [[Michael Gartner]]\n* [[Ken Kragen]] as Himself\n* [[Aaron Lustig]] as [[Paul Shaffer]]\n* Kevin Scannell as [[Dick Ebersol]]\n* Edmund L.
