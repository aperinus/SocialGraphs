It was the third of four films real-life couple Bacall and Bogart made together.<ref>The first two Bacall-Bogart films were ''[[To Have and Have Not (film)|To Have and Have Not]]'' (1944) and ''[[The Big Sleep (1946 film)|The Big Sleep]]'' (1946); the fourth would be ''[[Key Largo (film)|Key Largo]]'' (1948). {{IMDb title|id=0039302|title=Dark Passage}}.</ref>\n\nThe first portion of the film [[Point-of-view shot|subjectively depicts]] the male lead's point of view, concealing the face of Vincent Parry (Bogart), until the character undergoes [[plastic surgery]] to change his appearance. The story follows Parry's attempt to hide from the law and clear his name of murder.<ref name=\"Harrison 1947, page 142\"/>\n\n==Plot==\n[[File:Bacall and Bogart Dark Passage.jpg|thumb|right|Lauren Bacall and Humphrey Bogart in ''Dark Passage'']]\nVincent Parry (Bogart), convicted of killing his wife, escapes from [[San Quentin State Prison|San Quentin Prison]] and evades police by hitching a ride with a motorist named Baker. Already suspicious of Parry's appearance, Baker hears a radio news report about an escaped convict; Parry resorts to beating him unconscious. An apparent stranger, Irene Jansen (Bacall), picks Parry up and smuggles him past a police roadblock into San Francisco. She offers him shelter in her apartment while she goes to buy him some new clothes.\nIrene's acquaintance Madge comes by Irene's apartment, but Parry (through a closed door) tells her to leave. A former romantic interest whom Parry had spurned, Madge testified at his trial out of spite, claiming that his dying wife identified him as the killer. Irene explains that she had followed Parry's case with interest and that she believes Parry is innocent. Her own father had been falsely convicted of murder, and since then she has taken an interest in miscarriages of justice.\n\nParry leaves but is recognized by his cab driver, Sam, who turns out to be sympathetic and gives Parry the name of a plastic surgeon who can change his appearance. Parry arranges to stay with a friend, George Fellsinger, during his recuperation from the surgery.\nLater, Parry enters George's apartment to find him murdered; he sentimentally handles George's trumpet before leaving. He retreats to Irene's apartment; she nurses him back to health.\nIrene is called on by Madge and her ex-fianc\u00e9 Bob, who is romantically interested in Irene. While Parry hides in the bedroom, Madge asks to stay with Irene for protection, worried that Parry will kill her for testifying against him. As Irene insists that Madge leave, the latter unwittingly reveals that Irene recently had a male guest, thinking the voice she heard through the door was Bob's. Bob departs as well, having learned that Irene has another romantic interest.\nParry recuperates and learns that he is wanted for George's murder, his fingerprints having been found on the murder weapon, George's trumpet. After his bandages are removed, Parry reluctantly parts from Irene.\n\nParry decides to flee the city before trying to discover who really killed his wife. At a diner, an undercover policeman becomes suspicious of Parry's behavior. The policeman asks for identification, but Parry claims to have left it at his hotel. On the street, Parry darts in front of a moving car to escape. At the hotel, Parry is surprised by Baker, who holds him at gunpoint. Baker has been following Parry since they first met. He now demands that Irene pay him $60,000 or he will turn Parry over to the law. Parry agrees, and Baker obliges him to drive the two of them to Irene's apartment. Claiming to take a shortcut, Parry drives to a secluded spot underneath the [[Golden Gate Bridge]], where he succeeds in disarming Baker and questions him, becoming convinced that Madge is behind the deaths of his wife and friend. The two men fight, and Baker falls to his death.\n\nParry goes to Madge's apartment. Knowing she does not recognize him with his new face, he pretends to be a friend of Bob's and feigns interest in courting her. Parry soon reveals his true identity and accuses Madge of having killed both his wife and George. He shows her that he has all the accusations written down, and attempts to coerce her into making a confession. She refuses, and plunges through a window to her death.\nKnowing he cannot prove his innocence, and that he will likely be accused of Madge's murder as well, Parry decides to flee. He phones Irene, revealing his plans to relocate to South America; she says she will meet him there. Later, Parry waits with a drink in a beach bar in Peru. Irene arrives, and they embrace on the dance floor.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Dark-Passage-Moorehead-Bogart.jpg|thumb|Agnes Moorehead and Humphrey Bogart in ''Dark Passage'']]\n* [[Humphrey Bogart]] as Vincent Parry\n* [[Lauren Bacall]] as Irene Jansen\n* [[Bruce Bennett]] as Bob\n* [[Agnes Moorehead]] as Madge Rapf\n* [[Tom D'Andrea]] as Cabby (Sam)\n* [[Clifton Young]] as Baker\n* [[Douglas Kennedy (actor)|Douglas Kennedy]] as Detective Kennedy in Diner\n* [[Rory Mallinson]] as George Fellsinger\n* [[Houseley Stevenson]] as Dr. Walter Coley\n* [[John Arledge]] as Lonely Man (uncredited)\n* [[Frank Wilcox]] as Vincent Parry (picture in the newspaper, uncredited)\n\n==Production==\nWarner Bros. paid author [[David Goodis]] $25,000 for the rights to the story, which had originally been serialized in ''[[The Saturday Evening Post]]'' from July 20 to September 7, 1946, before being published in book form.<ref name=\"tcmnotes\">[http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/605/Dark-Passage/notes.html \"Notes\"] on [[TCM.com]]</ref> Bogart himself had read the book and wanted to make it into a movie.<ref>''Hold Your Breath and Cross Your Fingers: The Story of 'Dark Passage{{'}}'' (2003).

Film critic Hal Erikson believes ''Dark Passage'' does a better job at using this point-of-view technique, writing, \"The first hour or so of ''Dark Passage'' does the same thing\u2014and the results are far more successful than anything seen in Montgomery's film.\"<ref>Erikson, Hal. {{AllMovie title|12258|Dark Passage}}.</ref>\n\nAccording to Bacall, in her autobiography ''By Myself'', during the filming of ''Dark Passage'', Bogart's hair began to fall out in clumps, the result of [[alopecia areata]], although photos from their 1945 wedding show Bogart to be losing his hair two years earlier.  By the end of filming he wore a full wig.  Bogart eventually had [[Vitamin B12|B12]] shots and other treatments to counteract the effects, but he was helped by the fact that in his next film, ''[[The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (film)|The Treasure of the Sierra Madre]]'' he was required to wear a full wig.<ref name=\"tcm art\">Stafford, Jeff.
