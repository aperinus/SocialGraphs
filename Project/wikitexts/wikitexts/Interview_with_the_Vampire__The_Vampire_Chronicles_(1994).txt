It focuses on [[Lestat de Lioncourt|Lestat]] (Cruise) and [[Louis de Pointe du Lac|Louis]] (Pitt), beginning with Louis's transformation into a vampire by Lestat in 1791. The film chronicles their time together, and their turning of ten-year-old [[Claudia (The Vampire Chronicles)|Claudia]] ([[Kirsten Dunst]]) into a vampire. The narrative is framed by a present-day interview, in which Louis tells his story to a San Francisco reporter. The supporting cast features [[Christian Slater]], [[Antonio Banderas]], and [[Stephen Rea]].\n\nThe film was released in November 1994 to generally positive reviews<ref>{{cite web|url=https://rottentomatoes.com/m/interview_with_the_vampire/|work=Rotten Tomatoes|title=Interview with the Vampire|access-date=May 25, 2011}}</ref> and was a commercial success.

A [[stand-alone sequel]], ''[[Queen of the Damned]]'', was released in 2002, with [[Stuart Townsend]] replacing Cruise as Lestat.\n\n==Plot==\nIn modern-day [[San Francisco]], reporter [[Daniel Molloy]] interviews [[Louis de Pointe du Lac]], who claims to be a [[vampire]]. Louis describes his human life as a wealthy [[plantation]] owner in 1791 [[Louisiana (New Spain)|Spanish Louisiana]]. Despondent following the death of his wife and unborn child, he drunkenly wanders the waterfront of [[New Orleans]] one night and is attacked by the vampire [[Lestat de Lioncourt]]. Lestat senses Louis's dissatisfaction with life and offers to turn him into a vampire. Louis accepts, but quickly comes to regret it. While Lestat revels in the hunt and killing of humans, Louis resists his instinct to kill, instead drinking animal blood to sustain himself.\n\nEventually, amid an outbreak of [[Plague (disease)|plague]] in New Orleans, Louis feeds on a little girl whose mother died in the plague. To entice Louis to stay with him, Lestat turns the dying girl, [[Claudia (The Vampire Chronicles)|Claudia]], into a vampire. Together, they raise her as a daughter. Louis has a fatherly love for Claudia, while Lestat spoils and treats her more as a pupil, training her to become a merciless killer. Thirty years pass, and Claudia matures psychologically but remains a little girl in appearance and continues to be treated as such by Lestat. When she realizes that she will never grow older or become a mature woman, she is furious with Lestat and tells Louis that they should leave him. She tricks Lestat into drinking the \"dead blood\" of twin boys whom she killed by overdose with [[laudanum]], which weakens Lestat, and then slits his throat. Though Louis is shocked and upset, he helps Claudia dump Lestat's body in a  swamp. They spend weeks planning a voyage to Europe to search for other vampires, but Lestat returns on the night of their departure, having survived on the blood of swamp creatures. Lestat attacks them, but Louis sets him on fire, allowing them to escape to their ship and depart.\n\nAfter traveling around Europe and the Mediterranean but finding no other vampires, Louis and Claudia settle in [[Paris]] in 1870. Louis encounters vampires [[Santiago (The Vampire Chronicles)|Santiago]] and [[Armand (The Vampire Chronicles)|Armand]] by chance. Armand invites Louis and Claudia to his [[coven]], the ''[[Th\u00e9\u00e2tre des Vampires]]'', where vampires stage theatrical horror shows for humans. On their way out of the theater, Santiago reads Louis's mind and suspects that Louis and Claudia murdered Lestat. Armand warns Louis to send Claudia away for her own safety, and Louis stays with Armand to learn about the meaning of being a vampire. Claudia demands that Louis turn a human woman, Madeleine, into a vampire to be her new protector and companion, and he reluctantly complies. Shortly thereafter, the Parisian vampires abduct the three of them and punish them for Lestat's murder, imprisoning Louis in a coffin and trapping Claudia and Madeleine in a chamber, where sunlight burns them to ash. Armand does nothing to prevent this, but the next day he frees Louis. Seeking revenge, Louis returns to the theater at dawn and sets it on fire, killing all the vampires including Santiago. Armand arrives in time to help Louis escape the sunrise, and again offers him a place by his side. Louis rejects Armand and leaves, unable to accept Armand's way of life which involve forgetting the past and knowing Armand had allowed Claudia's murder.\n\nAs decades pass, Louis never recovers from the loss of Claudia and dejectedly explores the world alone. He returns to New Orleans in 1988 and one night encounters a decayed, weakened Lestat, living as a recluse in an abandoned mansion and surviving on rat blood as Louis once had. Lestat expresses regret for having turned Claudia into a vampire and asks Louis to rejoin him, but Louis declines and leaves. Louis concludes his interview with Molloy, prompting Molloy to beseech Louis to make him his new vampire companion. Louis is outraged that Molloy has not understood the tale of suffering he has related, and attacks Molloy to scare him into abandoning the idea. Molloy runs to his car and takes off, while playing the cassette tapes of Louis' interview in his car. On the [[Golden Gate Bridge]], Lestat appears and attacks Molloy, taking control of the car. Revived by Molloy's blood, Lestat offers Molloy the choice that he \"never had\"\u2014whether or not to become a vampire\u2014and, laughing, continues driving.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Tom Cruise]] as [[Lestat de Lioncourt]]\n* [[Brad Pitt]] as [[Louis de Pointe du Lac]]\n* [[Stephen Rea]] as [[Santiago (The Vampire Chronicles)|Santiago]]\n* [[Antonio Banderas]] as [[Armand (The Vampire Chronicles)|Armand]]\n* [[Christian Slater]] as [[Daniel Molloy]]\n* [[Kirsten Dunst]] as [[Claudia (The Vampire Chronicles)|Claudia]]\n* [[Domiziana Giordano]] as Madeleine\n* [[Thandiwe Newton]] (credited as Thandie Newton) as Yvette\n* [[Indra Ov\u00e9]] as New Orleans Whore\n* [[Laure Marsac]] as Mortal Woman on Stage\n* George Kelly as Dollmaker\n* [[Marcel Iure\u015f]] as Paris Vampire<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/movies/person/196385/Marcel-Iures/biography |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150929125002/http://www.nytimes.com/movies/person/196385/Marcel-Iures/biography |url-status=dead |archive-date=September 29, 2015 |title=Marcel Iures - Biography - Movies & TV |department=Movies & TV Dept. |work=[[The New York Times]] |author=Nathan Southern |date=2015 |access-date=March 3, 2016}}</ref>\n* [[Sara Stockbridge]] as Estelle\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nThe rights to Rice's novel were initially purchased by [[Paramount Pictures]] in April 1976, shortly before the book was published.

The score opens with the Catholic hymn ''[[Libera Me]]'' slightly rewritten to reflect Louis's character. The opening line \"Libera me, Domine, de morte \u00e6terna\" (\"Save me, Lord, from eternal death\") was changed to \"Libera me, Domine, de vita \u00e6terna\" (\"Save me, Lord, from eternal life\").\n\n\"[[Sympathy for the Devil]]\" was performed by [[Guns N' Roses]]. This was the band's last major release before the departure of [[Slash (musician)|Slash]] and [[Duff McKagan]].\n\n==Sequel==\n{{main|Queen of the Damned}}\nAlmost a decade after this film, [[Queen of the Damned|an adaptation]] for the third book in the series, ''[[The Queen of the Damned]]'', was produced and distributed once again by Warner Bros. Cruise and Pitt did not reprise their roles as Lestat and Louis. Many characters and important plotlines were written out of the film, which actually combined elements of ''[[The Vampire Lestat]]'' with ''The Queen of the Damned''. The film was negatively received by critics, and Rice dismissed it completely as she felt the filmmakers had \"mutilated\" her work. During pre-production, Rice had pleaded with the studio not to produce a film of the book just yet as she believed her readers wanted a film based on the second book in the series, ''[[The Vampire Lestat]]''. Rice was refused the cooperation of the studio.{{citation needed | date = October 2012}}\n\nIn February 2012, a film adaptation of ''[[The Tale of the Body Thief]]'', the fourth book in the series, entered development with [[Brian Grazer]] and [[Ron Howard]]'s film production company, [[Imagine Entertainment]]. It was reported that screenwriter Lee Patterson was going to pen the screenplay. However, Rice's son, Christopher, apparently had drafted a screenplay based on the novel that was met with praise from those involved in the developmental stage. Rice later confirmed that creative differences that were beyond those involved resulted in the dismissal of the project in April 2013.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/anne-rice-tale-of-body-thief-imagine-kurtzman-orci-287742 | work=The Hollywood Reporter | first=Borys | last=Kit | title=Anne Rice's 'Tale of the Body Thief' In Development With Imagine, Kurtzman/Orci}}</ref>\n\nIn August 2014 [[Universal Pictures]] acquired the rights to the entire ''Vampire Chronicles'' series.
