Produced by [[Hanna-Barbera]], it features the voices of [[Henry Corden]], [[Jean Vander Pyl]] and [[Frank Welker]]. It first aired November 21, 1994 on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]].\n\nThe special followed numerous [[Christmas]]-themed ''The Flintstones'' productions. It has been released on [[DVD]].\n\n==Plot==\nThe [[community theatre|Bedrock Community Players]] is mounting ''[[A Christmas Carol]],'' and all of the town's citizens are either planning to attend or be involved in the production: [[Barney Rubble]] is playing [[Bob Cratchit|Bob Cragit]], with [[Betty Rubble|Betty]] as Mrs. Cragit and his son [[Bamm-Bamm Rubble|Bamm-Bamm]] as [[Tiny Tim (A Christmas Carol)|Tiny Tim]]; Mr. Slate is [[Jacob Marley|Jacob Marbley]]; [[Wilma Flintstone]] is serving as the [[stage manager]], while her daughter [[Pebbles Flintstone|Pebbles]] plays Martha Cragit; even [[Dino (The Flintstones)|Dino]] has a role, playing the Cragit's family pet. It is [[Fred Flintstone|Fred]], though, who has landed the leading role of [[Ebenezer Scrooge|Ebonezer Scrooge]]. Unfortunately, he has let his role go to his head, thinking himself a star and spending all of his time rehearsing his lines rather than focusing on his job or family. On [[Christmas Eve]], in his rush to get to work and complete his Christmas Shopping, Fred forgets that he must take Pebbles to \"[[day care|cave care]]\", and later to pick her up from cave care. When Fred arrives at the theater, he discovers a furious Wilma, who breaks down in tears as she tells Fred about his mistake.\n\nThe play finally begins with narrator [[Charles Dickens|Charles Brickens]] reading the opening lines, and after a momentary bout of stage fright, Fred enters. The play proceeds as normal. As the second act opens, Wilma and Betty discover that Garnet, the woman playing the [[Ghost of Christmas Past]], has contracted the \"Bedrock Bug,\" a [[flu]]-like illness. As stage manager, Wilma is left to play the part herself. During the next scene, at Fezziwig's Christmas party, Betty informs Wilma that Maggie has come down with the Bedrock Bug as well; Wilma dons her costume and plays Belle. Fred realizes he forgot the presents and runs to the store, he is approached by the hooded figure of the [[Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come]], revealing to be the actor Philo Quartz, he drives him back to the theater. The second act takes place. The third act begins with the [[Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come]] appearing before Scrooge; he shows the elderly man an abandoned gravestone marked with the words \"EBONEZER SCROOGE.\" The scene shifts to Scrooge's bedchamber\u2014he is alive, and he discovers that it is Christmas morning. He recruits a passing boy (played by the same child who Fred entrusted with his presents) to purchase a prize \"Turkeysaurus\" and have it sent to the Cragits for a feast. Scrooge prepares to go out and explore the city on Christmas morning; along the way, he meets Wilma, who has taken on the role of one of the members of the Piltdown Charitable Foundation, as the original actor has caught the Bedrock Bug. Fred acts as if the woman is Belle (much to narrator Brickens's frustration, as the ad-libbing is not in his script), and begs for both her and Wilma's forgiveness, admitting his recent selfishness and promising that he has changed his attitudes. Wilma reluctantly plays along.\n\nThe play ends with the narrator informing the audience of the permanent change in the elderly man. Bamm-Bamm forgets his line \"God bless us, everyone!,\" leaving Pebbles to make the declaration herself. When the curtain falls, the company drops Fred and scolds him \"for being such a Scrooge.\" Fred apologizes, informing Wilma that he has finally realized that his friends and family, rather than his role in the production, are what matter most. As the company begins to depart, the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come takes off his hood, revealing himself as Dino, who took the part after Philo came down with the Bedrock Bug.\n\nA changed Fred says that when the Flintstones get home, he's going to make dinner and invite Wilma's mother. Unfortunately, after he says this, he comes down with the flu, and Wilma decides to make dinner with her mother's help, since the Bedrock Bug \"lasts for a day\".\n\n==Voice cast==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\n|-\n! scope=\"col\"| Performer\n! scope=\"col\"| ''[[The Flintstones]]'' character(s)\n! scope=\"col\"| ''[[A Christmas Carol]]'' character(s)\n|-\n| rowspan=\"1\"| [[Henry Corden]]\n| rowspan=\"1\"| [[Fred Flintstone]]\n| [[Ebenezer Scrooge|Ebonezer Scrooge]]\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\"| [[Jean Vander Pyl]]\n| rowspan=\"2\"| [[Wilma Flintstone]]\n| [[Ghost of Christmas Past]]\n|-\n| Belle\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\"| [[Frank Welker]]\n| rowspan=\"2\"| [[Barney Rubble]]\n| [[Bob Cratchit|Bob Cragit]]\n|-\n| [[Mr. Fezziwig]]\n|-\n| rowspan=\"1\"| [[Dino (The Flintstones)|Dino]]\n| [[Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come]]\n|-\n| rowspan=\"1\"| [[B.
