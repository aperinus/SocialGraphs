Her voice was dubbed by Olivia Hayman.\n\nThe title song was written by [[Bert Kalmar]] and [[Harry Ruby]], and was used as a recurring theme song in the [[Marx Brothers]] movie ''[[Horse Feathers]]'' (1932). Allen is a well-known [[Groucho Marx]] fan. Marx's theme song from ''[[Animal Crackers (1930 film)|Animal Crackers]]'' (1930) \"[[Captain Spaulding (Groucho Marx)|Hooray for Captain Spaulding]]\" is featured, sung in [[French language|French]] by a chorus of Groucho Marxes.
