The film stars [[Sam Neill]], [[William H. Macy]], [[T\u00e9a Leoni]], [[Alessandro Nivola]], [[Trevor Morgan (actor)|Trevor Morgan]], and [[Michael Jeter]]. It was written by [[Peter Buchman]], [[Alexander Payne]], and [[Jim Taylor (writer)|Jim Taylor]], and was directed by [[Joe Johnston]]. It is the first film in the franchise to not be directed by [[Steven Spielberg]], who served as executive producer, instead. It is also the franchise's first film to not be based on a novel by [[Michael Crichton]], although the film includes characters and ideas by him, including scenes from his first novel ''[[Jurassic Park (novel)|Jurassic Park]]'' (1990). Like its predecessor, the film takes place on [[Isla Sorna]], a fictional island of cloned dinosaurs located off [[Central America]]'s Pacific coast. The film involves a divorced couple (portrayed by Macy and Leoni) who trick paleontologist [[Alan Grant (Jurassic Park character)|Dr. Alan Grant]] (Neill) into helping them find their son (Morgan), who is missing on the island. Neill and [[Laura Dern]] reprised their roles from the first film, ''[[Jurassic Park (film)|Jurassic Park]]'' (1993).\n\nAfter the release of Spielberg's ''Jurassic Park'', [[Joe Johnston]] expressed interest in directing a sequel. Although Spielberg returned to direct the first sequel, he gave Johnston permission to direct a possible third film. [[Universal Pictures]] announced a third film in June 1998, with a release scheduled for mid-2000. Craig Rosenberg wrote the first draft of the script, about teenagers becoming marooned on Isla Sorna. Johnston was announced as director in 1999, and Rosenberg's draft was rejected. A second draft, by Buchman, involved dinosaur attacks in various mainland locations, while a parallel story within the script would involve Alan Grant and others crash-landing on Isla Sorna. Around five weeks before the start of filming, Johnston and Spielberg rejected the second draft in favor of a simpler story idea suggested by [[David Koepp]], the writer of the previous two films. Payne and Taylor were hired to rewrite the earlier script by Buchman, who made further revisions to their draft. The script also received uncredited work by [[John August]]. Filming lasted five months, and began in Hawaii on August 30, 2000, before moving to California. A final draft of the script was never completed during production, and Johnston considered quitting the project on a few occasions because of uncertainty about how the film would turn out. As with previous films, ''Jurassic Park III'' features a combination of [[Computer-generated imagery|computer-generated]] and [[animatronic]] dinosaurs, created respectively by [[Industrial Light & Magic]] and [[Stan Winston]]. Unlike the previous films, ''Jurassic Park III'' features a ''[[Spinosaurus]]'' as the main dinosaur antagonist, replacing the ''[[Tyrannosaurus rex]]''. The same creature would then make its return in the fourth season of ''[[Jurassic World Camp Cretaceous]]'' twenty years later.\n\n''Jurassic Park III'' was theatrically released on July 18, 2001. Despite mixed reviews from critics, the film was successful at the box office, grossing $368 million worldwide. Nevertheless, it is the lowest-grossing installment in the series. The next film in the series, ''[[Jurassic World]]'', was released in 2015, starting the ''Jurassic World'' trilogy. Neill and Dern reprised their roles in the 2022 film ''[[Jurassic World Dominion]]''.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for featured films are set between 400 and 700 words. -->\nTwelve-year-old [[Eric Kirby (Jurassic Park)|Eric Kirby]] and his mother's boyfriend, Ben Hildebrand, go [[parasailing]] near the restricted [[Isla Sorna]].{{efn|The island became restricted to visitors following the events of ''[[The Lost World: Jurassic Park]]'' (1997).}} The boat's crew is killed by an unknown attacker, prompting Ben to detach the line before the vessel crashes into rocks. Eric and Ben drift towards the island.\n\nEight weeks later, [[Paleontology|paleontologist]] [[Dr. Alan Grant]] struggles to secure funding for his ''[[Velociraptor]]'' research, and rebuffs the public's obsession with the events on [[Isla Nublar]].{{efn|As depicted in ''[[Jurassic Park (film)|Jurassic Park]]'' (1993).}} Grant discusses his research with longtime colleague [[Ellie Sattler|Ellie]], hypothesizing that ''Velociraptors'' were socially advanced beyond even [[primate]]s. In [[Montana]], his assistant, [[List of Jurassic Park characters#Billy Brennan|Billy Brennan]], uses a [[3D printing|three-dimensional printer]] to replicate a ''Velociraptor'' [[larynx]].\n\n[[List of Jurassic Park characters#Paul Kirby|Paul]] and [[Amanda Kirby]], a seemingly wealthy couple, offer to fund Grant's research if he gives them an illegal aerial tour of Isla Sorna. Grant reluctantly agrees and flies there with Billy, the Kirbys' associates Udesky and Cooper, and their pilot Nash. Grant learns that the Kirbys plan to land; he protests, but Cooper knocks him unconscious. Grant awakens to find the plane has landed, and the group flees when a predator approaches the runway. As the group boards the plane, Cooper is left behind. The plane lifts off as a ''[[Spinosaurus]]'' emerges and devours Cooper. Nash hits the dinosaur, and the plane crashes into the jungle. The ''[[Spinosaurus]]'' attacks the plane and eats Nash, who has Paul's [[satellite phone]]. The survivors flee, only to encounter a ''[[Tyrannosaurus]]''. The two dinosaurs fight, and the ''Spinosaurus'' kills the ''Tyrannosaurus'' as the humans escape.\n\nGrant confronts the Kirbys, who reveal they are a middle-class divorced couple searching for their son Eric and Amanda's boyfriend Ben. Government agencies declined to help, so they deceived Grant and brought him along, mistakenly believing him to have experience on Isla Sorna. The group searches for Eric and Ben as they travel to the coast. They find Ben's corpse attached to the parasail which Billy takes. They also stumble upon a ''Velociraptor'' nest, and Billy secretly places two eggs in his bag.\n\nThey soon discover an [[InGen]] compound, where a ''Velociraptor'' attacks them, before vocalizing for its pack. The humans escape within a herd of ''[[Corythosaurus]]'' and ''[[Parasaurolophus]]'', causing a stampede; Grant and Udesky are separated from the others. The ''Velociraptors'' trap Udesky and attempt to lure Paul, Amanda, and Billy from their place in a tree. Failing to coerce the group into rescuing Udesky, a ''Velociraptor'' kills him before the pack departs. Grant observes the pack communicating and suspects that they are searching for something; as he tries to slip away, they ambush him. Eric disrupts the pack with canisters of [[tear gas]] and brings Grant to an overturned supply truck where he has been taking shelter. The following morning, Grant and Eric reunite with Billy and the Kirbys; the group narrowly escapes the ''Spinosaurus''.\n\nGrant, suspicious of Billy, checks his bag and finds the ''Velociraptor'' eggs, which Billy reveals he planned to sell for funding. Grant decides to keep the eggs in the hopes that the ''Velociraptors'' may spare them if the eggs are returned. The group then unknowingly enters into an aviary filled with ''[[Pteranodon]]s''. A flock attacks the group and flies away with Eric. Billy rescues him using the parasail but is swarmed and seemingly killed. The group escapes the aviary but unintentionally leave the cage unlocked. They board a small barge and make their way down a river. That night, they retrieve the ringing satellite phone from the dung of the ''Spinosaurus''. Grant contacts Ellie and tells her where they are, but the ''Spinosaurus'' attacks the barge. Fuel from the boat leaks into the water, and Grant ignites it using a [[flare gun]], forcing the ''Spinosaurus'' to permanently flee.\n\nThe following day, the group arrive at the coast but are surrounded by the ''Velociraptor'' pack. Grant uses the replica larynx to confuse the pack and present their eggs. Upon hearing distant helicopters, the raptors reclaim their eggs and disappear into the jungle. The [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] lands on the beach, summoned by Ellie, and rescue the survivors. On a helicopter, they discover that Billy has also been rescued, albeit in a seriously injured state. They watch the newly escaped ''Pteranodons'' fly alongside them as they leave the island.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Main|List of Jurassic Park characters}}\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Sam Neill]] as [[Dr. Alan Grant]], a paleontologist\n* [[William H.

Grant agrees, and is scheduled to testify along with Simone at a hearing, to be held the next day in [[San Jos\u00e9, Costa Rica]].<ref name=Visual/>\n\nGrant also meets Paul Roby, a wealthy businessman who offers him a donation if he will host an aerial tour of Isla Sorna.

The leg, suspended in the air by two poles, was slammed down into one of the plane fuselage props for a series of shots.
