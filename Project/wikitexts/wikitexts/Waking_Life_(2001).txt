The film explores a wide range of philosophical issues, including the nature of reality, [[dream]]s and [[lucid dream]]s, [[consciousness]], the [[meaning of life]], [[free will]], and [[existentialism]].<ref name=\"Kehr\"/> It is centered on a young man who wanders through a succession of dream-like realities wherein he encounters a series of individuals who engage in insightful [[Philosophy|philosophical]] discussions.\n\nThe entire film was digitally [[rotoscoped]]. It contains several parallels to Linklater's 1991 film ''[[Slacker (film)|Slacker]]''. [[Ethan Hawke]] and [[Julie Delpy]] reprise their characters from the 1995 ''[[Before Sunrise]]'' in one scene.<ref name=\"MSNBC\"/><ref name=\"Obsessed\"/> ''Waking Life'' premiered at the [[2001 Sundance Film Festival]], and was released on October 19, 2001, where it received critical acclaim;<ref name=\"Metacritic\" /> however, it underperformed at the box office.\n\n==Plot==\nAn unnamed young man lives an ethereal existence that lacks transitions between everyday events and eventually progresses toward an [[existential crisis]]. He observes quietly but later participates actively in [[Philosophy|philosophical]] discussions involving other characters\u2014ranging from quirky scholars and artists to everyday restaurant-goers and friends\u2014about such issues as [[metaphysics]], [[free will]], [[social philosophy]], and the [[meaning of life]]. Other scenes do not even include the protagonist's presence but rather focus on a random isolated person, a group of people, or a couple engaging in such topics from a disembodied perspective. Along the way, the film also touches upon [[existentialism]], [[Situationist International|situationist]] politics, [[posthuman]]ity, the film theory of [[Andr\u00e9 Bazin]], and [[lucid dream]]ing, and makes references to various celebrated intellectual and literary figures by name.\n\nGradually, the protagonist begins to realize that he is living out a perpetual dream, broken up only by occasional [[false awakening]]s. So far, he is mostly a passive onlooker, though this changes during a chat with a passing woman who suddenly approaches him. After she greets him and shares her creative ideas with him, he reminds himself that she is a figment of his own dreaming imagination. Afterward, he starts to converse more openly with other dream characters, but he begins to despair about being trapped in a dream.\n\nThe protagonist's final talk is with a character (played by Richard Linklater) whom he briefly encountered previously in the film. This last conversation reveals this other character's view that reality may be only a single instant that the individual interprets falsely as time (and, thus, life); that living is simply the individual's constant negation of God's invitation to become [[God becomes the universe|one with the universe]]; that dreams offer a glimpse into the infinite nature of reality; and that in order to be free from the illusion called life, the individual need only accept God's invitation.\n\nThe protagonist is last seen walking into a driveway when he suddenly begins to levitate, paralleling a scene at the start of the film of a floating child in the same driveway. The protagonist uncertainly reaches toward a car's handle but is too swiftly lifted above the vehicle and over the trees. He rises into the endless blue expanse of the sky until he disappears from view.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Wiley Wiggins]] plays the protagonist.\n\nThe film features appearances from a wide range of actors and non-actors, including:\n{{div col}}\n* [[Eamonn Healy]]\n* [[Timothy \"Speed\" Levitch]]\n* [[Adam Goldberg]]\n* [[Nicky Katt]]\n* [[Ethan Hawke]] as Jesse\n* [[Julie Delpy]] as C\u00e9line\n* [[Steven Prince]]\n* [[Caveh Zahedi]]\n* [[Otto J\u00fcrgen Hofmann|Otto Hofmann]]\n* Richard Linklater\n* [[Alex Jones]]\n* [[Kim Krizan]]\n* [[Louis H.

The film was mostly produced using [[Rotoshop]], a rotoscoping program that creates blends between [[key frame]] vector shapes, which also uses virtual \"layers\", designed specifically for the production by [[Bob Sabiston]]. Linklater used this animation method again for his 2006 film ''[[A Scanner Darkly (film)|A Scanner Darkly]]''.\n\n==Release==\n''Waking Life'' [[Film premiere|premiered]] at the [[Sundance Film Festival]] in January 2001 and was given a limited release in the United States on October 19, 2001.\n\n===Reception===\nOn [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film has an approval rating of 81% based on 145 reviews, with an average rating of 7.40/10. The website's critical consensus reads: \"''Waking Life''{{'}}s inventive animated aesthetic adds a distinctive visual component to a film that could easily have rested on its smart screenplay and talented ensemble cast.\"<ref name=\"RT\"/> On [[Metacritic]], which uses a [[weighted average]], the film has a score of 82 out of 100 based on 31 reviews, indicating \"universal acclaim\".<ref name=\"Metacritic\"/> [[Roger Ebert]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' gave the film four stars out of four, describing it as \"a cold shower of bracing, clarifying ideas\".<ref name=\"Sun-Times\"/> Ebert later included the film on his list of \"Great Movies\".<ref>{{cite web |last1=Ebert |first1=Roger |title=All we see and all we seem is but a dream within a dream |url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/waking-life-2001-1 |website=RogerEbert.com |access-date=1 May 2022 |date=February 11, 2009}}</ref> [[Lisa Schwarzbaum]] of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' awarded the film an \"A\" rating, calling it \"a work of cinematic art in which form and structure pursue the logic-defying (parallel) subjects of dreaming and moviegoing,\"<ref name=\"Schwarzbaum\"/> while [[Stephen Holden]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote it was \"so verbally dexterous and visually innovative that you can't absorb it unless you have all your wits about you\".<ref name=\"Holden\"/> [[Dave Kehr]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' found the film to be \"lovely, fluid, funny\" and stated that it \"never feels heavy or over-ambitious\".<ref name=\"Kehr\"/>\n\nConversely, [[J. Hoberman]] of ''[[The Village Voice]]'' felt that ''Waking Life'' \"doesn't leave you in a dream... so much as it traps you in an endless bull session\".<ref name=\"Hoberman\"/> [[Frank Lovece]] felt the film was \"beautifully drawn\" but called its content \"pedantic navel-gazing\".<ref name=\"Lovece\"/>\n\nIn 2018, Richard Linklater addressed the potentially controversial inclusion of [[Alex Jones]] in the film. In an interview with [[IndieWire]], Linklater states, \"I just thought he was kind of funny.\" He notes that he never imagined Jones would one day be taken seriously and that at the time, he didn't think much of including him.<ref>{{Cite web|last1=Nordine|first1=Michael|date=2018-08-12|title=Richard Linklater on Casting Alex Jones in 'Waking Life': 'I Just Thought He Was Kind of Funny'|url=https://www.indiewire.com/2018/08/richard-linklater-alex-jones-waking-life-infowars-1201993393/|access-date=2020-12-02|website=IndieWire|language=en}}</ref>\n\nNominated for numerous awards, mainly for its technical achievements, ''Waking Life'' won the [[National Society of Film Critics]] award for \"Best Experimental Film\", the [[New York Film Critics Circle]] award for \"Best Animated Film\", and the \"CinemAvvenire\" award at the [[Venice Film Festival]] for \"Best Film\". It was also nominated for the Golden Lion, the festival's main award.\n\nThe film is recognized by [[American Film Institute]] in these lists:\n* 2008 \u2013 [[AFI's 10 Top 10]]: Nominated Animation Film<ref>{{cite web|url=http://connect.afi.com/site/DocServer/10top10.pdf?docID=381&AddInterest=1781 |title=AFI's 10 Top 10 Nominees |format=PDF |access-date=August 19, 2016 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716071937/http://connect.afi.com/site/DocServer/10top10.pdf?docID=381&AddInterest=1781 |archive-date=July 16, 2011 }}</ref>\n\n===Home media===\nThe film was released on [[DVD]] in North America in May 2002.

A Blu-Ray was released in Germany and the UK.\n\n==Soundtrack==\n{{Main|Waking Life (soundtrack)}}\nThe ''[[Waking Life (soundtrack)|Waking Life OST]]'' was performed and written by Glover Gill and the [[Tosca Tango Orchestra]], except for [[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin]]'s [[Nocturnes, Op. 9 (Chopin)|Nocturne in E-flat major, Op. 9, No. 2]]. The soundtrack was relatively successful. Featuring the [[nuevo tango]] style, it bills itself \"the 21st Century Tango\". The tango contributions were influenced by the music of the Argentine \"father of new tango\" [[Astor Piazzolla]].\n\n==See also==\n* [[Dream argument]]\n* [[Dream art]]\n*[[Oneironautics]]\n*
