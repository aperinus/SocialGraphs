The film stars [[Tim Robbins]], [[Patricia Arquette]], [[Rhys Ifans]], [[Miranda Otto]], and [[Rosie Perez]]. It tells the story of a writer with [[hypertrichosis]] and a psychologist who find a man acting like an ape in the woods.\n\nIt was screened out of competition at the [[2001 Cannes Film Festival|54th Cannes International Film Festival]].<ref name=\"Festival-Cannes.com\">{{cite web |url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/2001926/year/2001.html |title=Festival de Cannes: ''Human Nature'' |access-date=October 24, 2009 |work=Festival-Cannes.com}}</ref>\n\n== Plot ==\nMost of the film is told as [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]]: Puff ([[Rhys Ifans]]) testifies to Congress, Lila Jute ([[Patricia Arquette]]) tells her story to the police, while a dead Nathan Bronfman ([[Tim Robbins]]) addresses an unseen audience in the netherworld.\n\nLila is a woman with a rare hormonal imbalance which causes [[Hypertrichosis|thick hair to grow all over her body]]. During her 20s after a brief [[freak show]] gig, Lila decides to leave society and live within nature where she feels free to exist comfortably in her natural state. She writes a successful book about her naked, savage, happy, and free life in the woods embracing nature. Then, at age 30, strong sexual desire causes her to return to civilization and have her hair removed in order to find a partner.\n\nThe partner she finds is Dr. Nathan Bronfman, a psychologist researching the possibility of teaching table manners to mice. Lila and Nathan go hiking in the woods one day. Lila sights a naked man acting like an [[ape]] in the woods who has lived as a wild animal his entire life. Lila discards her clothes and chases him until he's cornered on a tree branch. The man falls off the branch, knocked unconscious. Brought to Nathan's lab, the man is named Puff, after Nathan's French research assistant Gabrielle's ([[Miranda Otto]]) childhood dog. We discover later from her phone call to an unknown person that she is actually an American with a fake French accent. First with the help of Gabrielle and later with Lila's help, Nathan performs conditioned reinforcement training on Puff, inculcating him with a veneer of fine manners and high culture, in spite of which Puff still has difficulty controlling sexual urges.\n\nTo demonstrate his success, Nathan takes Puff on tour. Puff secretly drinks heavily and patronizes prostitutes. Meanwhile, Nathan and Lila's relationship deteriorates and he is seduced into an affair by a scheming Gabrielle. Eventually Lila decides to take Puff back into the forest to undo his manners training and return him to his natural state.\n\nLila and Puff live naked in the woods together until found by a threatening Nathan, who is killed by Puff. Lila turns herself in as the murderer and asks Puff to testify on the waywardness of humanity before he returns to his home in the forest after a brief encounter with his biological mother ([[Nancy Lenehan]]).\n\nAfter the reporters and spectators leave, Puff comes back out of the forest and gets into a car with Gabrielle (still with a French accent). They drive off to the city to eat, while Puff looks back thoughtfully at the forest. The ending strongly suggests some unexplained collusion between the two, throwing much of the interpretation of what went on before into question.\n\nAt the end of the film, there is a philosophical passage read while the credits appear. It is an excerpt of [[William of Ockham]] from ''Opera Theologica'' in which Ockham explains his theory of intuitive cognition:<ref>Opera Theologica p. 31.</ref>\n\n{{cquote|Intuitive cognition is such that when some things are cognized, of which one inheres in the other, or one is spatially distant from the other, or exists in some relation to the other, immediately in virtue of that non-propositional cognition of those things, it is known if the thing inheres or does not inhere, if it is spatially distant or not, and the same for other true contingent propositions, unless that cognition is flawed or there is some impediment.\"}}\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Patricia Arquette]] as Lila Jute, a writer with [[hypertrichosis]].\n** [[Hilary Duff]] as Young Lila Jute\n* [[Tim Robbins]] as Nathan Bronfman, a psychologist.\n** Chase MacKenzie Bebak as Young Nathan Bronfman\n* [[Rhys Ifans]] as Puff, a man found in the forest acting like an ape.\n** Bobby Pyle as Young Puff\n* [[Rosie Perez]] as Louise, a friend of Lila who specializes in [[electrology]].\n* [[Miranda Otto]] as Gabrielle, Nathan's assistant who speaks in a French accent.\n* [[Peter Dinklage]] as Frank\n* [[Mary Kay Place]] as Mrs. Bronfman\n* [[Robert Forster]] as Mr. Bronfman\n* [[Toby Huss]] as Puff's Father, a man who acted like an ape which carried to his son after they relocated to the woods.\n* Ken Magee, [[Sy Richardson]], and [[David Warshofsky]] as the police detectives\n* Bobby Harwell and Daryl Anderson as the congressmen\n* [[Miguel Sandoval]] as Wendell, a therapist.\n* [[Nancy Lenehan]] as Puff's Mother\n\n== Production ==\n[[Steven Soderbergh]] was first interested in directing [[Charlie Kaufman]]'s script back in late 1996, when Kaufman was still trying to get ''[[Being John Malkovich]]'' produced. Soderbergh's considerations for casting were for [[David Hyde Pierce]] in the role of Nathan Bronfman, [[Chris Kattan]] in the role of Puff (likely due to his character Mr. Peepers on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' at the time), and [[Marisa Tomei]] in the role of Lila Jute. He was about to go into pre-production when he was offered ''[[Out of Sight (1998 film)|Out of Sight]]'' and after much deliberation he left the project.\n\n== Reception ==\n===Box office===\n''Human Nature'' has grossed $705,308 in the United States and Canada,<ref name=\"BOM1\"/> and $869,352 in other territories<ref name=\"BOM2\"/> for a worldwide total of 1.6 million, against a production budget of $8.6 million.<ref name=\"JP\"/>\n\n=== Critical response ===\nOn [[review aggregator]] [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film holds a score of 49% based on 94 reviews, and an average rating of 5.8/10.
