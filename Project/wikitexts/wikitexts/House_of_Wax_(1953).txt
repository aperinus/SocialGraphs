A remake by [[Warner Bros.]] of their 1933 film ''[[Mystery of the Wax Museum]]'', it stars [[Vincent Price]] as a disfigured sculptor who repopulates his destroyed wax museum by murdering people and using their wax-coated remains as displays. The film premiered in New York on April 10, 1953, and had a general release on April 25, making it the first 3D film with [[stereophonic]] sound to be presented in a regular theater and the first color [[3D film|3D feature film]] from a major American studio  ([[Columbia Pictures]]' ''[[Man in the Dark]]'', the first major-studio black-and-white 3D feature, premiered two days before ''House of Wax'').\n\nIn 1971, the film was re-released to theaters in 3D with a full advertising campaign. Newly struck prints of the film in [[Chris Condon]]'s single-strip StereoVision 3D format were used for this release. Another major re-release occurred during the 3D boom of the early 1980s. Warner Bros. released a very loose [[House of Wax (2005 film)|remake]] of the film in 2005, but it was poorly-received.\n\nThe [[Library of Congress]] selected ''House of Wax'' for preservation in the [[National Film Registry]] in 2014, deeming it \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/today/pr/2014/14-210.html|title=New Films Added to National Registry - News Releases - Library of Congress|publisher=loc.gov|access-date=November 1, 2016|archive-date=December 25, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201225022702/https://www.loc.gov/item/prn-14-210/|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Complete National Film Registry Listing|url=https://www.loc.gov/programs/national-film-preservation-board/film-registry/complete-national-film-registry-listing/|access-date=2020-06-25|website=Library of Congress|archive-date=December 17, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141217172059/https://www.loc.gov/programs/national-film-preservation-board/film-registry/complete-national-film-registry-listing/|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nIn New York City in the early 1900s, Professor Henry Jarrod is a talented sculptor who runs a [[wax museum]]. He creates [[Wax sculpture|wax statues]] of historical figures, but his business partner, Matthew Burke, is frustrated Jarrod will not make more sensational exhibits, like those that draw crowds to their competitors, and wants to end their partnership. A friend brings wealthy art critic Sidney Wallace to see the museum, and Wallace indicates he may be interested in buying Burke out when he gets back from Egypt in three months, but Burke says he needs money sooner than that for another investment opportunity and suggests burning down the museum to collect a $25,000 insurance policy. To Jarrod's horror, Burke then starts a fire, which spreads rapidly, and the two men fight while Jarrod's wax masterworks melt. Burke gets the better of Jarrod and leaves, and Jarrod is still inside when the building explodes.\n\nOvercoming the fact that Jarrod's body was never found, Burke is able to get all of the insurance money for himself. A disfigured man in a cloak strangles him and stages the murder to look like a suicide, and a few weeks later the same man murders Burke's fianc\u00e9e, Cathy Gray. Her unemployed roommate, Sue Allen, comes home and stumbles upon the murderer. She flees and he gives chase, but she makes it to her friend Scott Andrews' home. That night, the disfigured man steals Cathy's body from the [[morgue]] by lowering it out the window to two accomplices.\n\nWallace receives a letter from Jarrod and learns he miraculously survived the fire, though he now uses a wheelchair and his hands are too damaged to sculpt. Jarrod asks Wallace to invest in a new wax museum, which will feature statues made by his assistants Igor, who is [[deaf]] and [[Muteness|mute]], and Leon Averill. He hopes to recreate his favorite pieces from his old museum, but will also concede to popular taste by including a chamber of horrors showcasing acts of violence from the past and present, including the apparent suicide of Burke, whose corpse went missing from the morgue.\n\nSue attends the opening of Jarrod's museum with Scott and is troubled by how much the [[Joan of Arc]] statue looks like Cathy. Jarrod overhears her and claims he based the figure on photos of Cathy he saw in the newspaper. He then hires Scott, who is a sculptor prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Wallace, as an assistant and asks Sue to model for a new [[Marie Antoinette]] statue, as she strongly resembles his earlier one.\n\nBelieving Cathy's body was used to make the Joan of Arc statue, Sue talks to Detective Lieutenant Tom Brennan. He agrees to investigate Jarrod and his museum and Sergeant Jim Shane recognizes Averill as a criminal wanted for breaking parole. Shane arrests Averill, who has a pocketwatch belonging to a missing deputy city attorney on him, though he says he found it.\n\nThe same night, Sue arrives at the museum after hours to meet with Scott, but Jarrod sent him on an errand when he heard she was coming. Not finding anyone around, she pulls a brunette wig off the Joan of Arc statue, exposing Cathy's blonde hair underneath, which proves to her that the figure is indeed Cathy's wax-coated body. Jarrod observes her discovery and gets up from his wheelchair. He grabs Sue and she strikes him, shattering a wax mask that concealed his disfigured face. Sue recognizes Jarrod as the murderer and faints.\n\nTo get a drink, Averill, an alcoholic, tells Brennan that many of Jarrod's figures have real bodies under the wax. As the police race to the House of Wax and Jarrod prepares to turn Sue into his beloved Marie Antoinette, Scott returns to the museum and, finding Sue's purse next to the wig and wheelchair, searches for her. Igor tries to stop him and they tussle, and the police arrive just in time to prevent Igor from decapitating Scott with the [[guillotine]] in one of the displays. The police storm into Jarrod's workshop and Jarrod fight them off until he is knocked into a vat of hot wax. Brennan moves Sue out of the way before the wax pours over her.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Vincent Price]] as Professor Henry Jarrod, a mad and disfigured sculptor \n* [[Frank Lovejoy]] as Detective Lieutenant Tom Brennan, a detective on the wax museum Murder case \n* [[Phyllis Kirk]] as Sue Allen and Marie Antoinette\n* [[Carolyn Jones]] as Cathy Gray, Sue's roommate\n* [[Paul Picerni]] as Scott Andrews, Sue's friend and a sculptor\n* [[Roy Roberts]] as Matthew Burke, Jarrod's business partner\n* [[Angela Clarke (American actress)|Angela Clarke]] as Mrs. Andrews, Scott's mother\n* [[Paul Cavanagh]] as Sidney Wallace, a wealthy art critic who invests in Jarrod's museum\n* [[Dabbs Greer]] as Sergeant Jim Shane, Tom's Partner on the wax museum murder case \n* [[Charles Bronson]] (credited as Charles Buchinsky) as Igor, Jarrod's assistant, who is [[deaf]] and [[Muteness|mute]]\n* Reggie Rymal as the [[Barker (occupation)|barker]] with [[paddle ball]]s\n* [[Philip Tonge]] as Bruce Allison, Jarrod's friend, who brings Wallace to the museum (uncredited)\n* [[Ruth Warren]] as the scrubwoman who finds Burke's corpse (uncredited)\n* Riza Royce as Ma Flannigan, who runs the [[rooming house]] at which Sue and Cathy rent a room (uncredited)\n* [[Frank Ferguson]] as the [[medical examiner]] (uncredited)\n* [[Grandon Rhodes]] as the [[autopsy]] surgeon (uncredited)\n* Eddie Parks as the senior [[morgue]] attendant (uncredited)\n* Jack Woody as the junior morgue attendant (uncredited)\n* [[Nedrick Young]] as Carl Hendricks/Leon Averill, Jarrod's assistant (uncredited)\n* Mary Lou Holloway as Millie, a patron at Jarrod's museum (uncredited)\n* Shirley Whitney as one of Millie's friends (uncredited)\n* Joanne Brown as one of Millie's friends (uncredited)\n* Oliver Blake as the pompous patron with a pocketwatch at Jarrod's museum (uncredited)\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\nFilmed under the working title ''The Wax Works'', ''House of Wax'' was [[Warner Bros.]]' answer to the surprise 3D hit ''[[Bwana Devil]]'', an independent production that premiered in November 1952.{{citation needed|date=October 2022}} Seeing promise in the future of 3D films, Warner Bros. contracted Julian and Milton Gunzburg's Natural Vision 3D system, the same one used for ''Bwana Devil'', and decided to film a remake of their 1933 [[two-color Technicolor]] thriller ''[[Mystery of the Wax Museum]]'', which was based on [[Charles S. Belden]]'s three-act play ''The Wax Works''. Although the entire newspaper angle of the earlier film was eliminated and ''Mystery'' was set in the year it was released, whereas ''House of Wax'' was set in circa 1902, the two films have many similarities in plot and dialogue.\n\nAmong the foregrounded uses of 3D in the film were scenes featuring fights, [[can-can]] girls, and a [[paddle ball]]-wielding [[Barker (occupation)|barker]]. In what may be the film's cleverest and most startling 3D effect, the shadowy figure of one of the characters seems to spring up out of the theater audience and run into the screen. As director [[Andre DeToth]] was blind in one eye, he was unable to experience stereo vision or 3D effects. [[Vincent Price]] recalled: \"It\u2019s one of the great Hollywood stories. When they wanted a director for [a 3D] film, they hired a man who couldn\u2019t see 3D at all! Andr\u00e9 de Toth was a very good director, but he really was the wrong director for 3D. He\u2019d go to the rushes and say 'Why is everybody so excited about this?' It didn\u2019t mean anything to him. But he made a good picture, a good thriller. He was largely responsible for the success of the picture. The 3D tricks just happened&mdash;there weren\u2019t a lot of them. Later on, they threw everything at everybody.\"<ref>Steve Biodrowski [http://cinefantastiqueonline.com/2007/12/09/retrospective-house-of-wax-1953 \"House of Wax (1953) \u2013 A Retrospective\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090831155558/http://cinefantastiqueonline.com/2007/12/09/retrospective-house-of-wax-1953/ |date=August 31, 2009 }}, Cinefantastique website; accessed November 1, 2016.</ref> Some modern critics feel DeToth's inability to see depth is what makes the film superior, since he was more concerned with telling a thrilling story and getting believable performances from the actors than simply tossing things at the camera.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\n==Release==\nThe film premiered in Los Angeles at the [[Paramount Theatre (Los Angeles)|Paramount Theatre]] on April 16, 1953.
