Starring [[Luke Wilson]], [[Maya Rudolph]], [[Dax Shepard]], and [[Terry Crews]], the film tells the story of Corporal Joe Bauers (Wilson), a [[U.S. Army]] librarian who, along with prostitute Rita (Rudolph), takes part in a government [[Suspended animation|hibernation]] experiment. The experiment goes awry, and Joe awakens in the year 2505, in a [[dystopian]]<ref name=\"salon.com\" /> world [[Dumbing down|dumbed-down]] by mass [[commercialism]], rampant [[anti-intellectualism]] and the domination of [[low culture]], to find that he is by far the smartest person on the planet.\n\n''Idiocracy'' serves as a social [[Satire (film and television)|satire]] that touches on issues including commercialism and [[anti-intellectualism]]. The film was not screened for critics, and the distributor, [[20th Century Fox]], was accused of abandoning it. Despite its lack of a major theatrical release, which resulted in a mere $495,000 gross at the box office, the film received positive reviews from critics and has since become a [[cult film]].<ref name=\"NYTJoke\">{{cite news |date=May 4, 2008 |first=Rob |last=Walker |title=This Joke's for You |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/04/magazine/04wwln-consumed-t.html |work=[[The New York Times Magazine]] |access-date=May 26, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110618015448/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/04/magazine/04wwln-consumed-t.html |archive-date=June 18, 2011 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summary should be between 400 and 700 words. -->\nIn 2005, [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] librarian Corporal Joe Bauers is selected for a [[suspended animation]] experiment as the \"[[Average Joe|most average]]\" individual in the entire armed forces. Lacking a suitable female candidate, the military hires a sex worker named Rita by bribing her [[pimp]] Upgrayedd. When the officer in charge is arrested for running his own prostitution ring under Upgrayedd's tutelage, the experiment is forgotten. Over the next five centuries, societal expectations lead the most intelligent humans to choose not to have children while the least intelligent [[dysgenics|reproduce indiscriminately]], creating increasingly dumber generations.\n\nIn 2505, Joe and Rita's suspension chambers are unearthed by the collapse of a mountain-sized garbage pile, with Joe's chamber crashing into the apartment of Frito [[Pendejo]]. Wandering around what was once [[Washington, D.C.]], Joe finds a population that has become profoundly [[anti-intellectualism|anti-intellectual]], speaking only low [[register (sociolinguistics)|registers]] of English and wallowing in [[overconsumption]] and crass popular entertainment. Technology is still advanced but often malfunctioning, driven by garish [[commercialism]] or extreme simplicity, such as healthcare workers handling computer equipment akin to [[elementary education]] software. Believing that he is hallucinating after a year of hibernation, Joe enters a hospital and realizes the truth. Arrested for not having a [[bar code]] tattoo to pay for his doctor's appointment, he is sent to prison after being assigned the grossly incompetent Pendejo as his lawyer.\n\nRita also leaves her chamber, resuming work as a sex worker, but soon realizes that people have become so stupid that she can charge customers money without actual services. Joe is renamed \"Not Sure\" by a faulty speech-recognition tattooing machine and takes a rudimentary [[intelligence quotient|IQ test]]. The police take Joe to jail. While in line to be admitted, Joe tricks a guard by claiming that he is meant to be released and runs out the door, successfully escaping prison. He finds Frito, who reveals that a time machine exists to return him to 2005, and Joe bribes him with promises of riches through [[compound interest]] on a bank account he will open for Frito in the 21st century. Leading Joe and Rita to the time machine, Frito takes them into a gigantic [[Costco]] store, where Joe is identified by a tattoo scanner and apprehended.\n\nJoe is taken to the [[White House]] and is appointed [[United States Secretary of the Interior|Secretary of the Interior]], as the IQ test identified him as the most intelligent person alive. President Camacho introduces Joe to the cabinet and gives him the impossible job of fixing the nationwide food shortages, [[dust bowl]]s, and crippled economy within a week. Joe discovers that the nation's crops are irrigated with Brawndo, a \"[[sports drink|thirst mutilator]]\" whose parent corporation owns the [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]], [[Federal Communications Commission|FCC]], and [[United States Department of Agriculture|USDA]]. When Joe has the irrigation system replaced with water, Brawndo's stock plummets, causing massive layoffs and riots, without any visible agricultural improvement.\n\nJoe is sentenced to die in a monster truck [[demolition derby]] featuring undefeated \"rehabilitation officer\" Beef Supreme. However, Beef's oversized vehicle is crushed trying to enter the arena, and Joe manages to defeat the other vehicles. Rita and Frito discover that Joe's reintroduction of water to the soil has allowed vegetation to grow. Showing the sprouting crops on the stadium's [[Jumbotron]] prompts Camacho's [[presidential pardon]].\n\nJoe and Rita decide to stay in the future, although later they discover that they had no choice as the \"time masheen\" Frito mentioned is merely a childishly inaccurate history-themed amusement ride. Following Camacho's term, Joe is elected president and marries Rita. They conceive the world's three smartest children, while new Vice President Frito takes eight wives and fathers thirty-two of the world's stupidest children. The film ends with Joe's inaugural speech, where he praises earlier civilizations for their technology and wonders and expresses hope this society will one day as well.\n\nIn a [[post-credits scene]], Upgrayedd awakens from a suspension chamber, and sets off to find Rita.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|<!-- Cast is in credits order and named as credited; please do not change. -->\n* [[Luke Wilson]] as Corporal Joe Bauers\n* [[Maya Rudolph]] as Rita\n* [[Dax Shepard]] as Frito Pendejo\n* [[Terry Crews]] as President Dwayne Elizondo Mountain Dew Herbert Camacho\n* [[David Herman]] as Secretary of State\n* [[Justin Long]] as Doctor Lexus\n* [[Andrew Wilson (actor)|Andrew Wilson]] as Beef Supreme\n* Randal Reeder as Secret Service Thug\n* [[Scarface (rapper)|Brad \"Scarface\" Jordan]] as Upgrayedd\n* [[Stephen Root]] as the Judge \n* [[Thomas Haden Church]] as Brawndo CEO\n* [[Sara Rue]] (uncredited) as Attorney General<ref>{{cite tweet|number=593838187174170625|title=#TBT a picture from #Idiocracy \"IT'S GOT ELECTROLYTES\"|user=sararueforreal|date=30 April 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hallmarkchannel.com/all-for-love/cast/sara-rue|title=Sara Rue as Jo on All for Love|publisher=Hallmark Channel|access-date=10 October 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181010213634/http://www.hallmarkchannel.com/all-for-love/cast/sara-rue|archive-date=October 10, 2018|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n}}\n\n==Themes==\nThe idea of a [[dystopia]]n society based on [[dysgenics]] can be traced back to the work of Sir [[Francis Galton]].

In a 2018 interview with ''GQ Magazine'', he talked of advertisers being unhappy at the way they were portrayed, which affected the studio's efforts to promote the movie. He said, \"The rumor was, because we used real corporations in our comedy (I mean, Starbucks was giving hand jobs) these companies gave us their name thinking they were gonna get 'pumped up', and then we're like, 'Welcome to Costco, we love you' [delivered in monotone]. All these real corporations were like, 'Wait a minute, wait a minute' [...] there were a lot of people trying to back out, but it was too late.
