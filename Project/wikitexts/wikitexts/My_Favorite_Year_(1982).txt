The film tells the story of a young comedy writer<ref>{{cite news| newspaper=[[Variety Film Reviews|Variety]]| title=My Favorite Year| date=December 31, 1981| url=https://variety.com/1981/film/reviews/my-favorite-year-1200425157/| access-date=November 10, 2019}}</ref> and stars [[Peter O'Toole]], [[Mark Linn-Baker]], [[Jessica Harper]], and [[Joseph Bologna]]. O'Toole was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Actor]]. The film was adapted into an unsuccessful 1992 [[My Favorite Year (musical)|Broadway musical of the same name]].\n\n==Plot==\nBenjy Stone, the narrator, recalls the week (in his \"favorite year\" of 1954) when he met his idol, swashbuckling actor Alan Swann (inspired by [[Errol Flynn]], whose title roles such as that in ''[[Captain Blood (1935 film)|Captain Blood]]'' would be evoked by Swann's imagined one in ''Captain from Tortuga''). During television's early days, Benjy works as a junior comedy writer for a variety show called ''Comedy Cavalcade'' starring Stan \"King\" Kaiser that is broadcast live from the NBC studios at [[30 Rockefeller Plaza]]. Swann, well past his prime, is booked as a guest star and arrives at the studio drunk. Kaiser nearly removes Swann from the show until Benjy intervenes, promising to keep Swann sober during the week preceding his scheduled appearance.\n \nWith help from Swann's chauffeur Alfie, Benjy continuously monitors Swann. They learn much about each other, finding out that they each have family whom they want to remain out of the spotlight. Benjy's Jewish mother is married to Filipino former [[bantamweight]] boxer Rookie Carroca, and Benjy has embarrassing, uncouth relatives, including Uncle Morty. Swann's young daughter Tess has been raised entirely by her mother, one of his many ex-wives. He rarely visits but secretly keeps tabs on her, unable to muster the courage to reconnect with her.\n \nDuring the week of rehearsals, Kaiser is threatened by gangster Karl Rojeck, a corrupt union boss who objects to being parodied on the show. Disruptive events, ambiguous between real sabotage and random accidents, are noted after Kaiser belligerently insists on performing the \"Boss Hijack\" sketch.\n\nBenjy clumsily and overenthusiastically courts K.C. Downing, producer Leo Silver's pretty assistant. Swann mentors Benjy, and Benjy is unable to prevent the drunken star from crashing a party at the home of K.C.'s affluent parents as they find themselves in the wrong apartment.\n \nThe night of the show, Swann suffers a panic attack after Benjy informs him that the program is broadcast live, not filmed as Swann had expected. Swann becomes drunk and flees the studio. Benjy angrily confronts him, telling Swann that he always believed that he was the swashbuckling hero whom he had watched on the silver screen and that deep down, Swann possesses those qualities.\n \nAs the \"Boss Hijack\" sketch gets under way, Rojeck's men appear backstage and attack Kaiser. The fight spills onto the stage during the live broadcast, and the audience believes that it is part of the sketch. Swann and Benjy observe the melee from the balcony. Swann, dressed for a musketeer skit, grabs a rope and swings onto the stage and into action. He and Kaiser defeat the thugs together before the unwitting audience.\n \nBenjy narrates the epilogue, relating that Swann, his confidence bolstered, visits his daughter the next day, enjoying a heartfelt reunion.\n\n==Cast==\n<!--- Cast and order per tombstone opening credits, roles per closing credits scroll --->\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Peter O'Toole]] as Alan Swann\n* [[Mark Linn-Baker]] as Benjy Stone\n* [[Jessica Harper]] as K.C.

[[Gloria Stuart]], who would 15 years later would set the record as the oldest person to receive an Academy Award nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]] for her role in ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]'' at the age of 86, appears as Mrs. Horn.\n\n{{more footnotes needed|date=April 2020}}\n\n==Relationship to real life==\nExecutive producer [[Mel Brooks]] was a writer for the [[Sid Caesar]] variety program ''[[Your Show of Shows]]'' early in his career. Brooks has claimed that movie swashbuckler [[Errol Flynn]] was a guest on one episode, and that the appearance inspired Dennis Palumbo's largely fictional screenplay. He also said that Swann was based on Flynn, and Benjy Stone is based on both Brooks and [[Woody Allen]], who also wrote for Caesar.{{citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nAccording to Brooks, the character Rookie Carroca was based on a Filipino sailor in the U.S. Navy who was his neighbor in Brooklyn. The name of the King Kaiser character is based on that of Sid Caesar (\"Kaiser\" is the German equivalent of the Roman title Caesar). [[Selma Diamond]], another former ''Your Show of Shows'' writer (who inspired [[Rose Marie]]'s character on ''The Dick Van Dyke Show''), appears in the film as a wardrobe mistress.{{citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nThe character Herb, a comedy writer who whispers rather than speaks, is based on [[Neil Simon]], another of Caesar's staff writers, who, according to [[Carl Reiner]], whispered ideas to colleagues rather than trying to shout to be heard above the din of the noisy writers' room.{{citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n \nBrooks acknowledges that most of the film's plot is fictional. He said that Flynn's appearance on ''Your Show of Shows'' was uneventful and that none of the writers had much interaction with Flynn, became his friend or took him home to dinner.{{citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\n==Production==\nThe film was based on an original script by Norman Steinberg.<ref>Klemesrud, Judy.
