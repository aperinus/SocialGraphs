The film stars [[Sam Rockwell]] and [[Anjelica Huston]]. Production took place in [[New Jersey]] in 2007. It premiered at the [[2008 Sundance Film Festival]] and was purchased by [[Fox Searchlight Pictures]] for distribution. The film was released on September 26, 2008 and the DVD was released on February 17, 2009.\n\nChoke is based on the 2001 [[Choke (novel)|novel of the same name]] by [[Chuck Palahniuk]]. It tells the story of a man who works in a colonial theme park, attends [[sexual addiction]] recovery meetings, and intentionally chokes on food in upscale restaurants so his \"rescuers\" would give him money out of sympathy and thus cover his mother's [[Alzheimer's disease]] hospital bills.\n\n==Plot==\nVictor Mancini is a [[Sexual addiction|sex addict]] who works as a [[Historical reenactment|reenactor]] of [[Colonial history of the United States#Colonial life|life in Colonial America]]. He works with his best friend, Denny, who is also a reformed sex addict. To support his hospitalized mother, Ida, Victor cons others by intentionally choking at restaurants to get money from his rescuers.\n\nWhen he visits his mother one day, he meets Dr Paige Marshall, who takes care of her. She tells Victor that his mother's condition is worsening and that they could try an experimental [[Stem cell research|stem cell technique]] that would require harvesting cells from the [[umbilical cord]] of a newborn baby with Victor's genes. She persuades Victor to have sex with her so she can have his child and save his mother.\n\nVictor never knew his father and is anxious to obtain the information from his mother, but she never recognizes him when he visits. He asks Denny to pose as him and ask her questions. Denny agrees and reveals that Victor's mother kept a diary. Victor finds it, but it is in Italian. Paige tells Victor she can read [[Italian language|Italian]] and agrees to translate the diary.\n\nVictor and Paige try several times to have sex, but Victor cannot maintain an erection. After discussing it with Denny, Victor realizes he loves Paige. She then reveals to him that his mother may have fled [[Italy]] because she stole [[Holy Prepuce|Jesus' foreskin]], and used its cells to conceive Victor, making him the [[Second Coming]]. He is reluctant to believe but, in the end, accepts Paige's assertion. However, his mother finally recognizes him and tells him that she stole him as a baby and she has no idea who his birth parents are. As she tells him this, he feeds her chocolate pudding and accidentally chokes her to death.\n\nWhile Paige tries to resuscitate Victor's mother, a hidden band around her wrist falls into Victor's view, revealing that she is a patient in the hospital\u2014not a doctor. Paige then reveals that she was admitted to the hospital years ago, in a [[Catatonia|catatonic]] state, and fell in love with Victor through the stories his mother told her about him. As she was a former medical student, the nurses allowed her to wear a white coat, as it calmed her down. Paige, a voluntary patient, checks herself out without saying goodbye to Victor.\n\nAfter his mother's funeral, Victor boards a plane. He goes to the bathroom and the door opens to reveal Paige joining him.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Sam Rockwell]] as Victor Mancini, a sex addict who cons people in order to fund the care of his hospitalized mother.<ref name=\"stuck\" />\n** [[Jonah Bobo]] as young Victor\n* [[Anjelica Huston]] as Ida Mancini, Victor's mother.<ref name=stuck/>\n* [[Kelly Macdonald]] as Paige Marshall<ref name=stuck/>\n* [[Brad William Henke]] as Denny, Victor's best friend, a reformed sex addict.

Gregg worked on the book for five years, trying to adapt it faithfully. He decided to write his personal version of the story, believing that it would be one that Chuck Palahniuk would oppose. To Gregg's surprise, the author liked and supported the departures made in Gregg's version.<ref name=park>{{cite news | url=https://www.indiewire.com/people/2008/01/park_city_08_in_1.html | title= Park City '08 Interview \u2013 ''Choke'' Director Clark Gregg | work=indieWire.com | publisher=[[indieWire]] | date=2008-01-02 | accessdate=2008-03-13 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080209221213/http://www.indiewire.com/people/2008/01/park_city_08_in_1.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archive-date = 2008-02-09}}</ref>  Gregg described the difficulty of writing the script: \"It's a tricky adaptation because like a lot of Chuck's work, it operates in a heightened satirical, dark world, yet this one is one of his black romantic comedies, so getting the tone right took me some time.\"<ref name=\"stuck\" />\n\n===Filming===\nGregg was attached to film ''Choke'' in his directorial debut. Production was originally slated for 2006, but Gregg was temporarily occupied with a key role on the TV comedy series ''[[The New Adventures of Old Christine]]''. By July 2007, Gregg cast actor [[Sam Rockwell]] in the lead role, as well as supporting cast members. Production began in the same month in [[New Jersey]].<ref name=\"stuck\">{{cite journal | first=Borys | last=Kit | url= https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/film/news/e3idb81209fbb0303b69e894d71e18dddf7 | title=2 get stuck with Gregg on 'Choke' | journal=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] | publisher=[[Nielsen Company]] | date=2007-07-12 | accessdate=2007-07-16 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070714202134/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/film/news/e3idb81209fbb0303b69e894d71e18dddf7 <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archive-date = 2007-07-14}}</ref> Filming lasted 25 days with a budget of $3.4 million. Gregg had acted with Rockwell in a play, and the director believed that Rockwell would switch effortlessly between the dramatic and comedic moments in the film.<ref name=park/> A major filming location was the defunct [[Essex County Hospital Center|Essex County Psychiatric Hospital]] in [[Cedar Grove, New Jersey|Cedar Grove]]. The hospital was considered a critical location by filmmakers, who believed that production would not have taken off without the discovered hospital, due to the project's minimal budget.<ref>{{cite news | first=Philip | last=Read | url=http://www.nj.com/starledger/stories/index.ssf?/base/news-3/1186115367216960.xml&coll=1 | title=Psychiatric facility is going 'Hollywood' | work=[[The Star-Ledger]] | publisher=[[Advance Publications]] | date=2007-08-03 | accessdate=2007-08-07 }}</ref>\n\nAs opposed to dark comedies that had a sustained tone, Gregg found ''Choke'' to be more tonally complex, and that it would veer between \"extremely dramatic moments\" and \"absurdly silly ones\".  The director sought to find a way to combine the two elements, drawing inspiration from the [[Hal Ashby]] films ''[[Harold and Maude]]'' (1971) and ''[[Being There]]'' (1979) and contemporary films like ''[[Secretary (2002 film)|Secretary]]'' (2002) and ''[[Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind]]'' (2004). In addition, the limited budget forced the director to consider economical measures throughout production.<ref name=\"park\" />\n\n===Music===\nThe song \"[[Reckoner]]\" from [[Radiohead]]'s ''[[In Rainbows]]'' was used to play over the film's final credits.
