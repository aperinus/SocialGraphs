The film centers on a [[melodrama]]tic [[love triangle]] between amiable [[Bank|banker]] Johnny (Wiseau), his deceptive [[Engagement|fianc\u00e9e]]<!-- Don't replace with \"future wife\" unless in the context of the film's dialogue. --> Lisa (Danielle) and his conflicted [[Best friends forever|best friend]] Mark (Sestero). A significant portion of the film is dedicated to a series of unrelated [[subplot]]s, most of which involve at least one supporting character and are left unresolved due to the film's inconsistent narrative structure. The work was reportedly intended to be [[semi-autobiographical]] in nature; according to Wiseau, the title alludes to the potential of a [[room]] to be the site of both good and bad events.<ref name=\"qa\" /> The stage play from which the film is derived was so-called due to its events taking place entirely in a single room.{{sfn|Sestero|Bissell|2013|p=228}}\n\nA number of publications have labeled ''The Room'' as one of [[List of films considered the worst#The Room (2003)|the worst films ever made]]. An assistant professor of [[film studies]] was the first to describe ''The Room'' as \"the ''[[Citizen Kane]]'' of bad movies.\"<ref name=\"ew2\"/> Originally shown only in a [[Limited release|limited number of California theaters]], ''The Room'' quickly became a [[cult film]] due to its bizarre and unconventional storytelling, technical and narrative flaws, and Wiseau's off-kilter performance. Although Wiseau has retrospectively described the film as a [[black comedy]], audiences have generally viewed it as a poorly made [[Drama (film and television)|drama]], an opinion shared by some of the cast. Although the film was a [[box-office bomb]], sales and notoriety significantly increased in later years.<ref>{{Cite web |title=The Room |url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/title/tt0368226/credits/ |access-date=2022-02-25 |website=Box Office Mojo}}</ref>\n\n''[[The Disaster Artist]]'', Sestero's [[memoir]] of the making of ''The Room'', was co-written with [[Tom Bissell]] and published in 2013. A [[The Disaster Artist (film)|film of the same title]] based on the book, directed by and starring [[James Franco]], was released on December 1, 2017; the book and film received widespread acclaim and numerous award nominations.\n\n== Plot ==\nJohnny is a successful banker who lives in a [[San Francisco]] [[townhouse]] with his fianc\u00e9e<!-- Don't replace with \"future wife\" unless in the context of the film's dialogue. --> Lisa, who has become dissatisfied with their relationship. She seduces his best friend, Mark, and the two begin a secret [[affair]]. Meanwhile, Johnny, having overheard Lisa confessing her infidelity to her mother, Claudette, attaches a [[tape recorder]] to their phone in an attempt to identify her lover by recording their phone conversations.\n\nDenny, a neighboring [[college]] student whom Johnny financially and emotionally supports, has a run-in with an armed [[Illegal drug trade|drug dealer]], Chris-R, but Johnny and Mark overpower and detain him. Denny also lusts after Lisa and confesses this to Johnny, who understands and encourages him to instead pursue one of his classmates. Johnny spirals into a mental haze and calls upon Peter \u2013 his and Mark's friend and a [[psychologist]] \u2013 for help. Mark also confides in Peter that he feels guilty about his affair. When Peter asks Mark if the affair is with Lisa, Mark attacks Peter and attempts to kill him, but they quickly reconcile.\n\nAt a [[Party|surprise birthday party]] for Johnny, his friend Steven catches Lisa kissing Mark while the other guests are outside and confronts them about the affair. Johnny announces that he and Lisa are [[Pregnancy|expecting a child]], although Lisa later reveals she lied about it in order to cover up the truth about the affair. At the end of the evening, Lisa flaunts her affair in front of Johnny and Mark starts to attack him.\n\nAfter the party, Johnny locks himself in the bathroom in despair. When he leaves, he retrieves the cassette recorder that he attached to the phone and listens to an intimate call between Lisa and Mark. Outraged, Johnny berates Lisa for betraying him, prompting her to end their relationship permanently and live with Mark. Johnny then has an [[Mental disorder|emotional breakdown]], angrily destroying his apartment and [[Suicide|committing suicide]] by shooting himself in the mouth.\n\nHearing the commotion, Denny, Mark, and Lisa rush up the stairs to find his dead body and the gun that he shot himself with in his hand. Mark blames Lisa for Johnny's death, admonishes her for her deceitful behavior, and tells her to get out of his life. Denny tells Lisa and Mark to leave him with Johnny, and they step back to give him a moment, but ultimately, they all stay and comfort each other as the police arrive.\n\n== Cast ==\n[[File:GregSestero (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Photograph of a man with a collared shirt facing the camera.|[[Greg Sestero]], who portrayed Mark in ''The Room'' and served as its [[line producer]], wrote ''[[The Disaster Artist]]'' based on his experiences working on the film.]]\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Tommy Wiseau]] as Johnny, a successful [[banker]] who is engaged to Lisa.\n* [[Juliette Danielle]] as Lisa, Johnny's fianc\u00e9e<!-- Don't replace with \"future wife\" unless in the context of the film's dialogue. -->, who engages in an affair with Mark.\n* [[Greg Sestero]] as Mark, Johnny's best friend, who is having an affair with Lisa.\n* Philip Haldiman as Denny, a young college student who is financially and emotionally supported by Johnny.\n* Carolyn Minnott as Claudette, Lisa's mother.\n* Robyn Paris as Michelle, Lisa's best friend and personal advisor.\n* Scott Holmes as Mike, Michelle's boyfriend.\n* [[Dan Janjigian]] as Chris-R, a drug dealer who threatens Denny.\n* Kyle Vogt as Peter, a psychologist and friend of Mark and Johnny\n* Greg Ellery as Steven, a friend of Johnny and Lisa\n}}\n\n== Production ==\n=== Development ===\nTommy Wiseau originally wrote ''The Room'' as a [[Play (theatre)|play]] in 2001 after seeing the film ''[[The Talented Mr. Ripley (film)|The Talented Mr. Ripley]]''.<ref name=\"ew2\"/><ref name=\"LAist\">{{cite news|last1=Shatkin|first1=Elina|url=http://laist.com/2007/04/27/laist_interviews_tommy_wiseau_the_face_behind_the_billboard.php|title=LAist Interviews Tommy Wiseau, The Face Behind The Billboard|work=[[LAist]]|date=April 27, 2007|access-date=June 19, 2017|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170619164427/http://laist.com/2007/04/27/laist_interviews_tommy_wiseau_the_face_behind_the_billboard.php|archive-date=June 19, 2017}}</ref> He then adapted the play into a 540-page book, which he was unable to get published.<ref name=\"pm1\"/> Frustrated, Wiseau instead decided to [[Film adaptation|adapt the play into a film]], producing it himself in order to maintain creative control.<ref name=\"pm1\"/><ref name=\"varsity\">{{cite web|last1=Sloan|first1=Will|title=The Varsity Interview: Tommy Wiseau|url=https://thevarsity.ca/2011/04/27/the-varsity-interview-tommy-wiseau/|work=[[The Varsity (newspaper)|The Varsity]]|date=April 27, 2011|access-date=June 19, 2017|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170619031136/https://thevarsity.ca/2011/04/27/the-varsity-interview-tommy-wiseau/|archive-date=June 19, 2017}}</ref>\n\nWiseau has been secretive about how he obtained funding for the project, but he told ''Entertainment Weekly'' that he made some of the money by importing [[leather jacket]]s from [[Korea]].<ref name=\"ew2\"/> According to ''[[The Disaster Artist]]'' (Greg Sestero's book based on the making of ''The Room''), Wiseau was already independently wealthy at the time production began. Over several years, he claims to have amassed a fortune through [[entrepreneurship]] and real estate development in [[Los Angeles]] and [[San Francisco]], a story Sestero found impossible to believe.{{sfn|Sestero|Bissell|2013|pp=246\u201350}} Although many of the people involved with the project feared that the film was part of a [[money laundering]] scheme for organized crime, Sestero also found this possibility unlikely.{{sfn|Sestero|Bissell|2013|pp=100, 160}}  Wiseau spent the entire {{US$|6000000|2003|round=-5|about=yes|link=yes}} budget for ''The Room'' on production and marketing;<ref name=\"ew2\"/> Wiseau stated that the film was relatively expensive because many members of the cast and crew had to be replaced.<ref name=\"onion-wiseau\"/> According to Sestero, Wiseau made numerous poor decisions during filming that unnecessarily inflated the film's budget, such as building sets for sequences that could have been filmed on location, purchasing production equipment rather than renting it, and filming scenes multiple times using different sets.{{sfn|Sestero|Bissell|2013|p=98}} Wiseau also forgot his lines and place on camera, resulting in minutes-long dialogue sequences taking hours or days to shoot. Wiseau's antics on the set further caused the film's cost to skyrocket, according to Sestero.{{sfn|Sestero|Bissell|2013|p=71}}\n\nAccording to Sestero and Greg Ellery, Wiseau rented a [[Sound stage|studio]] at the Birns & Sawyer film lot and bought a \"complete Beginning Director package\", which included two film and [[High-definition video|HD]] cameras;<ref name=\"rifftrax\">{{cite web|last1=Lastowka|first1=Conor|title=RiffTrax Interview with The Room's Greg Ellery|url=http://blog.rifftrax.com/2009/06/12/rifftrax-interview-with-the-rooms-greg-ellery/|website=[[RiffTrax]]|access-date=June 19, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090617102354/http://blog.rifftrax.com/2009/06/12/rifftrax-interview-with-the-rooms-greg-ellery/|archive-date=June 17, 2009|date=June 12, 2009|url-status=dead}}</ref> Wiseau was confused about the differences between [[35mm movie film|35 mm film]] and high-definition video, yet he wanted to be the first director to film an entire movie simultaneously in two formats.

Sestero had limited film experience and agreed to work as part of the production crew only as a favor to Wiseau, with whom he had been friends for some time before production began. Sestero then agreed to play the Mark character after Wiseau fired the original actor on the first day of filming. Sestero was uncomfortable filming his sex scenes and was allowed to keep his jeans on while shooting them.<ref name=\"weis\"/>\n\nAccording to Greg Ellery, Juliette Danielle had \"just gotten off the bus from [[Texas]]\" when the shooting began, and \"the cast watched in horror\" as Wiseau jumped on Danielle, immediately beginning to film their \"love scene.\"<ref name=\"rifftrax\"/> Sestero disputed this, stating that the sex scenes were among the last filmed.{{sfn|Sestero|Bissell|2013|p=234}} Wiseau said that Danielle was originally one of three or four [[Understudy|understudies]] for the Lisa character and was selected after the original actress left the production.<ref name=\"onion-wiseau\">{{cite web|last1=Heisler|first1=Steve|work=[[The A.V.

Lisa often stops discussions about Johnny by saying \"I don't want to talk about it.\"\n\nIn ''The Disaster Artist'', Sestero recalls that Wiseau planned a [[subplot]] in which Johnny was revealed to be a [[vampire]] because of Wiseau's fascination with the creatures.{{sfn|Sestero|Bissell|2013|p=84}} Sestero recounts how Wiseau tasked the crew with devising a way for Johnny's [[Mercedes-Benz]] to fly across the San Francisco [[skyline]], revealing Johnny's vampiric nature. {{sfn|Sestero|Bissell|2013|p=92}}\n\n=== Filming ===\n[[Principal photography]] lasted four months.

The many rooftop sequences were shot on the soundstage, and exteriors of San Francisco were [[Chroma key|greenscreen]]ed in.<ref name=\"ew2\"/> A behind-the-scenes feature shows that some of the roof scenes were shot in August 2002.

Other executive producer credits include Chloe Lietzke and Drew Caffrey.

Schklair told ''EW'' that Wiseau became too engrossed with his acting duties to direct the film properly and asked him to \"tell the actors what to do, and yell 'Action' and 'Cut' and tell the cameraman what shots to get.\" The script supervisor also said that Wiseau asked Schklair to \"direct [his] movie\" but refused to give up the director title. The story is corroborated by one of the film's actors (who requested anonymity) and by Sestero in ''The Disaster Artist''. Sestero describes Schklair taking charge of numerous sequences in which Wiseau found himself unable to remember lines or adequately interact with the rest of the cast, but jokes that claiming directorial credit was like \"claiming to have been the ''[[LZ 129 Hindenburg|Hindenburg]]''{{'}}s principal aeronautics engineer\", and also notes that Schklair left the production before the end of principal photography in favor of the short film ''Jumbo Girl'' due to that project being shot by [[Janusz Kami\u0144ski]].{{sfn|Sestero|Bissell|2013|p=27}}{{sfn|Sestero|Bissell|2013|p=211}} Wiseau has dismissed Schklair's comments, saying, \"Well, this is so laughable that...you know what? I don't know, probably only in America it can happen, this kind of stuff\"; he similarly implied that Schklair's abandoning of the film during filming was justification for not receiving such a credit.<ref name=\"varsity\"/>\n\n== Analysis ==\n=== Interpretations, themes, and influences ===\n{{Quote box|quote=Tommy's life study of human interaction had been put into a Final Draft blender and sprinkled with the darkness of whatever he'd been living through over the last nine months.

In analyzing the film's abrupt tone shifts, Sestero highlighted two scenes in particular. In the first scene, Johnny enters the rooftop in the middle of a tirade about being wrongfully accused of domestic abuse, only to become abruptly cheerful upon seeing Mark; a few moments later, he laughs inappropriately upon learning that a friend of Mark's had been severely beaten. On set, Sestero and script supervisor Sandy Schklair repeatedly tried to convince Wiseau that the line should not be delivered as comical, but Wiseau refused to refrain from laughing.{{sfn|Sestero|Bissell|2013|p=66}} In the second instance, occurring later in the film, Mark attempts to kill Peter by throwing him off a roof after Peter expresses his belief that Mark is having an affair with Lisa; seconds later, however, Mark pulls Peter back from the edge of the roof, apologizes, and the two continue their previous [[conversation]] with no acknowledgment of what just occurred. {{sfn|Sestero|Bissell|2013|p=36}}\n\nIn addition to being rife with [[Continuity (fiction)|continuity errors]], the film has several [[Plot (narrative)|plots]], [[Subplot|subplots]] and character details whose [[Consistency|inconsistencies]] have been commented on by critics and audiences.<ref>{{cite magazine|last1=Jones|first1=Nate|title=''The Room'': The Awful Movie Everyone Wants to See|url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1992396,00.html|magazine=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|access-date=July 27, 2017|date=May 26, 2010|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170624173432/http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1992396,00.html|archive-date=June 24, 2017}}</ref> ''[[The Portland Mercury]]'' has stated that a number of \"plot threads are introduced, then instantly abandoned.\"<ref name=\"pm1\">{{cite news|last1=Lannamann|first1=Ned|url=https://www.portlandmercury.com/portland/interview-with-tommy-wiseau/Content?oid=1573119|title=Tommy Wiseau: The Complete Interview(s)|work=[[The Portland Mercury]]|date=August 13, 2009|access-date=June 16, 2017|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170619164319/https://www.portlandmercury.com/portland/interview-with-tommy-wiseau/Content?oid=1573119|archive-date=June 19, 2017}}</ref> In an early scene, halfway through a conversation about planning a birthday party for Johnny, Claudette off-handedly tells Lisa: \"I got the results of the test back.

In ''The Disaster Artist'', Sestero states that he created a backstory for the character in which Mark was an [[undercover operation|undercover]] [[Vice#Vice squad|vice detective]], which Sestero felt united several otherwise disparate aspects of Mark's character, including the secretive nature of various aspects of his behavior&nbsp;\u2013 including [[marijuana]] use&nbsp;\u2013 his mood swings, and his handling of the Chris-R incident. Wiseau dismissed adding any reference to Mark's past to the script.{{sfn|Sestero|Bissell|2013|pp=195\u2013196}} The makers of ''The Room'' video game would later introduce a similar idea as part of a subplot involving Mark's unexplained backstory, much to Sestero's amusement.{{sfn|Sestero|Bissell|2013|p=195}}\n\nAt one point, the principal male characters congregate in an alley behind Johnny's apartment to play catch with a [[Ball (gridiron football)|football]] while wearing [[Black tie|tuxedos]]. When Mark arrives, he is revealed to have shaved his [[beard]], and the camera slowly zooms in on his face while dramatic music plays on the soundtrack. Nothing that is said or occurs during the scene has any effect on the plot; the scene ends abruptly when the men decide to return to Johnny's apartment after Peter trips. Similar to most of the other plot points of the film, the event is introduced abruptly and is never referenced elsewhere in the story. Wiseau received enough questions about the scene that he decided to address it in a Q&A segment featured on the DVD release; rather than explaining the scene, though, Wiseau states only that playing football without the proper protective equipment is fun and challenging.<ref name=\"qa\">''The Room'' DVD Bonus Features: Q&A</ref> Sestero has been questioned about the significance of Mark's shaving, though his only response for several years was \"if people only knew.\"<ref name=\"weis\">{{cite web|last1=Weisberg|first1=Sam|url=https://screencomment.com/2011/07/interview-gregsestero/|title=An Interview with The Room's Main Actor, Greg Sestero|work=Screen Comment|date=July 20, 2011|access-date=June 19, 2017|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170619164408/https://screencomment.com/2011/07/interview-gregsestero/|archive-date=June 19, 2017}}</ref> He describes in ''The Disaster Artist'' that Wiseau insisted he shave his beard on-set just so that Wiseau would have an excuse for Johnny to call Mark \"Babyface,\" Wiseau's own nickname for Sestero, and that the revealing of beardless Mark would be \"a moment.\" Sestero further detailed how the football-in-tuxedos scene was concocted on set by Wiseau, who never explained the significance of the scene to the cast or crew and insisted that the sequence be filmed at the expense of other, relevant scenes.{{sfn|Sestero|Bissell|2013|pp=196\u2013198}}\n\n== Release ==\n=== Promotion ===\nAccording to Sestero, Wiseau submitted the film to [[Paramount Pictures]], hoping to get them as the distributor. Usually, it takes about two weeks to get a reply. ''The Room'' however was rejected within 24 hours. Because of this, the film was promoted almost exclusively through a single [[billboard]] in [[Hollywood, Los Angeles|Hollywood]], located on [[Highland Avenue (Los Angeles)|Highland Avenue]] just north of Fountain Avenue, featuring an image Wiseau refers to as \"Evil Man\": an extreme [[close-up]] of his own face with one eye in mid-blink.<ref name=\"onion-wiseau\"/><ref name=\"LAist\"/> Although more conventional artwork was created for the film, featuring the main characters' faces emblazoned over the [[Golden Gate Bridge]], Wiseau chose the \"Evil Man\" for what he regarded as its provocative quality; around the time of the film's release, the image led many passers-by to believe that the movie was a [[horror film]].<ref name=\"onion-wiseau\"/> Wiseau also paid for a small television and print campaign in and around Los Angeles,<ref name=\"ew2\"/> and hired publicist [[Edward Lozzi]] in his efforts to promote and self-distribute the film after it was turned down by Paramount.{{sfn|Sestero|Bissell|2013|p=263}}\n\nDespite the film's failure to enjoy immediate success, Wiseau paid to keep the billboard up for over five years, at the cost of {{US$|5000}} a month.{{sfn|Sestero|Bissell|2013|p=100}}<ref>{{cite magazine|last1=Maloney|first1=Devon|title=10 Years After ''The Room'', Tommy Wiseau Is Still Hollywood's Biggest Mystery|url=https://www.wired.com/2013/09/tommy-wiseau-interview-room/|magazine=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]|access-date=July 27, 2017|date=September 4, 2013|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170727143021/https://www.wired.com/2013/09/tommy-wiseau-interview-room/|archive-date=July 27, 2017}}</ref> Its bizarre imagery and longevity led to it becoming a minor tourist attraction.<ref name=\"ew2\"/>{{sfn|Sestero|Bissell|2013|p=262}} When asked how he managed to afford to keep the billboard up for so long in such a prominent location, Wiseau responded: \"Well, we like the location, and we like the billboard.
