The film stars [[Mary McDonnell]], [[Alfre Woodard]], [[Vondie Curtis-Hall]], [[David Strathairn]], [[Leo Burmester]], and [[Angela Bassett]].\n\nIt tells the story of a [[soap opera]] star, paralyzed after being struck by a taxi, who is forced to return to her family home and rely upon a series of nurses, forcing each of them to leave her employment until one shows up guaranteed to stay.\n\n==Plot==\nMay-Alice Culhane, a New York actress on a daytime [[soap opera]], lies in a hospital bed, confused and scared because she is unable to sit up. She attempts to press the call button but ends up switching on the TV, which happens to be playing a scene from the soap featuring her.\n\nCulhane has been left paralyzed after an accident on her way to getting her legs waxed. With no other options, she returns to her family's old and empty home in Louisiana, where she drinks hard, is dissatisfied with every caregiver, and wallows in self-pity.\n\nHer outlook begins to change with the arrival of Chantelle, a nurse with her own problems. The two gradually find a heartfelt connection with each other, and as a result, their lives subtly change.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Mary McDonnell]] as May-Alice Culhane\n* [[Alfre Woodard]] as Chantelle\n* [[Vondie Curtis-Hall]] as Sugar LeDoux\n* [[David Strathairn]] as Rennie\n* [[Leo Burmester]] as Reeves\n* [[Nora Dunn]] as Ti-Marie\n* Michael Mantell as Dr. Kline\n* Mary Portser as Precious\n* [[Angela Bassett]] as Dawn/Rhonda\n* [[Sheila Kelley (American actress)|Sheila Kelley]] as Kim\n* [[Maggie Renzi]] as Louise\n* [[Tom Wright (American actor)|Tom Wright]] as Luther\n}}\n\n== Production ==\nDirector [[John Sayles]] said his inspiration for the story came from the film ''[[Persona (1966 film)|Persona]]'', as well as his own experiences working as a hospital [[orderly]].<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite news |last=Horn |first=John |title=Sayles shows a passion for independence |pages=4 DA |work=[[The Associated Press]] |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZU4pAAAAIBAJ&pg=PA25 |access-date=July 14, 2022 |via=[[Deseret News]]}}</ref> In recovery for a back injury, Sayles was in the queue for X-rays and observed many of the wheelchair-bound patients were women accompanied by their nurses.
