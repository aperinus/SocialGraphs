The film stars [[Lou Taylor Pucci]], [[Tilda Swinton]], [[Vincent D'Onofrio]], [[Kelli Garner]], [[Benjamin Bratt]], [[Vince Vaughn]], and [[Keanu Reeves]]. The plot focuses on Justin Cobb, a teenager in suburban [[Oregon]], as he copes with his [[thumb-sucking]] problem, romance, and his diagnosis with [[Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder|ADHD]] and subsequent experience using [[Methylphenidate|Ritalin]]. The screenplay was adapted from the 1999 [[Walter Kirn]] [[Thumbsucker (novel)|novel of the same name]]. Swinton also served as an executive producer.\n\nThe film was shot on location in the [[Portland metropolitan area]] in 2003, and premiered at the [[Sundance Film Festival]] in January 2005. It received a limited release in the United States on September 16, 2005.\n\n==Plot==\nJustin Cobb is a shy 17-year-old in a family of four in suburban [[Oregon]]. He has a persistent thumb-sucking habit his father disapproves of, which has led to major [[orthodontic]] repair. He addresses his parents by their first names, Mike and Audrey, so as not to make his father feel old. Audrey, a [[registered nurse]], is idly fascinated by actor Matt Schramm, entering a contest to win a date with him. She insists it is \"innocent fun\", but is inordinately concerned with looking attractive for the contest.\n\nJustin struggles on his school's [[debate team]], led by Mr. Geary which he joined to get closer to his environmentalist classmate Rebecca. He tries to start a relationship with her, but she rejects him after he cannot open up to her about his thumb-sucking habit.\n\nAt a regular checkup, Justin's orthodontist, Dr. Perry Lyman, indicates he can tell that Justin is still sucking his thumb, and attempts [[hypnosis]], coaching Justin to find his [[power animal]] (a deer) and [[Post-hypnotic suggestion|suggesting]] that his thumb will taste like [[echinacea]]. This works, and Justin finds his thumb distasteful, but falls deeper into frustration without the crutch. After Justin conspires with his brother to disrupt Dr. Lyman in a bicycle race with Justin's father, his school counselor prods the Cobbs to give him [[Ritalin]]. While his parents wring their hands over the idea, Justin insists that he needs the help.\n\nAlmost immediately after beginning treatment, Justin begins to have elevated energy, confidence and focus. He begins to excel on the debate team, unseating Rebecca from the star position; she quits the team and drifts into the [[Drug culture|stoners]] crowd. Justin's newfound aggressiveness nets the debate team repeated awards. Simultaneously, he begins to challenge the [[Neurosis|neuroses]] of the adults around him, especially their struggles with aging. With a somewhat deceitful cover letter, he applies to [[New York University|NYU]], in spite of his mother's urging that he go to college closer to home.\n\nAfter rambling incoherently at the state debate championship, Justin quits the debate team, throws away the pills, and seeks out Rebecca to hook him up with [[Cannabis (drug)|pot]]. During their smoking sessions, Rebecca blindfolds him and engages with him in kissing and other sexual activity, which Justin interprets as a relationship. But when he broaches the subject, Rebecca tells him otherwise, calling their meetings an \"experiment.\" He quits both her and the drugs.\n\nBoth Justin and his father suspect that Audrey is having an affair with Schramm after she is transferred to a celebrity [[Drug rehabilitation|rehab]] facility where Schramm has been committed. Attempting to catch his mother in the act, he instead meets Schramm sneaking a smoke in the bushes, and learns the unromantic truth. The next day, he receives an acceptance letter from NYU.\n\nDuring a final checkup, Dr. Lyman reveals to Justin his discovery that thumb-sucking is not a medically debilitating problem, and says that everyone has their own flaws and nobody has all the answers&mdash;that in fact learning to live without having the answers is (perhaps) the answer. On his flight to New York, Justin dreams of reaching his goal of being a TV anchor, \"sharing the truth with the world\". He wakes up after [[Somniloquy|sleeptalking]] to find his thumb in his mouth and an attractive girl smiling at him. Slightly embarrassed but self-confident, he introduces himself.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Lou Taylor Pucci]] as Justin Cobb\n** Colton Tanner as 10-year-old Justin\n** Mason Bromberg as 4-year-old Justin<ref>{{Citation|title=Thumbsucker|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0318761/|access-date=2019-08-17}}</ref>\n* [[Tilda Swinton]] as Audrey Cobb\n* [[Vincent D'Onofrio]] as Mike Cobb\n* [[Keanu Reeves]] as Dr. Perry Lyman\n* [[Kelli Garner]] as Rebecca\n* [[Benjamin Bratt]] as Matt Schramm\n* [[Vince Vaughn]] as Mr. Geary\n* Chase Offerle as Joel Cobb\n* Kit Koenig as Principal\n* [[Nancy O'Dell]] as herself\n* [[Walter Kirn]] (''[[Cameo appearance|cameo]]'') as Debate judge\n\n==Production==\n===Casting===\nLou Taylor Pucci was cast in the lead role of Justin after director Mills auditioned around 150 teenaged actors.<ref name=state/> Swinton was cast as his mother, Audrey, after meeting director Mills eighteen months prior to the production: \"I met Mike 18 months ago.
