It was directed by [[Tony Bill]], a pilot and aviation enthusiast.<ref>Farmer 2006, p. 18.</ref> The screenplay about men in [[aerial combat]] was written by Phil Sears, Blake T. Evans and David S. Ward with the story by Blake T. Evans. Themes of friendship, racial prejudice, revenge and love are also explored in the film.\n\nThe film follows the [[enlistment]], training, and combat experiences of a group of young Americans who volunteer to become fighter pilots in the [[Lafayette Escadrille]], the 124th air squadron formed by the French in 1916. The squadron consisted of five French officers and 38 American volunteers who wanted to fly and fight in World War I before the United States' entry into the war in 1917.<ref name= \"Lafayette\">Sherman, Steven. [http://www.acepilots.com/wwi/lafayette.html \"Lafayette Escadrille: American Volunteer Pilots in WWI.\"] ''acepilots.com'', 2007. Retrieved: April 27, 2008.</ref> The film ends with an epilogue that relates the fate of each American pilot to the real-life Lafayette Escadrille pilot upon whom his character was based.<ref name=\"Lafayette\" />\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1916, a group of young Americans go to [[France]] to serve in the French Air Service, ''L'[[History of the Arm\u00e9e de l'Air (1909\u20131942)#World War I (1914\u20131918)|A\u00e9ronautique militaire]]'' during World War I. The recruits are under the command of French [[Captain (land)|Captain]] [[Georges Thenault]], with veteran [[flying ace]] Reed Cassidy as their mentor.\n\nThe pilots struggle with the demands of flying, preparing for the aerial [[dogfight]]s that dominate missions to the front lines. Pilot Blaine Rawlings meets a young woman named Lucienne after his plane runs out of fuel and crashes during a practice flight, and over time they grow a relationship despite her hesitations about his risky profession.\n\nOn their first mission, escorting bombers to attack a German ammunition depot [[Jametz]], the rookie pilots are ambushed by Germans. Two are killed in the battle (Toddman and Dewitt), and a third (Nunn) successfully makes an emergency landing, but is killed on the ground by \"The Black Falcon\", a German pilot flying a black aircraft; the more chivalrous German pilot Franz Wolferd shakes his head in disapproval.\n\nDuring a later battle, Rawlings' machine gun jams; Wolferd \u2013 the pilot he was chasing \u2013 flies beside him and salutes before banking away, sparing his opponent's life as penance for the unfair killing of Nunn on the ground. Higgins is killed during the battle, and Jensen breaks that night, unable to fly anymore due to shock. Beagle is accused of being a spy due to faked personal information, but comes clean about a crime he committed in the states and is allowed to stay on.\n\nWhen the Germans attack a column of civilians, the American pilots head off to stop them. Rawlings kills Wolferd during the engagement after sparing him once when the German dives after another American. Beagles plane is brought down over no-mans land, with the plane pinning his hand. Rawlings lands his plane and make his way to Beagle, but can't free him and so is forced to chop his hand off to get him to safety.\n\nLearning that German forces have advanced into Lucienne's village, Rawlings steals a plane in the middle of the night to rescue them, but Lucienne is wounded and taken to a hospital. Returning to base, he is praised by the commander and awarded the [[Croix de Guerre]] medal for bravery.\n\nOrdered to attack a German [[Zeppelin]], Porter is killed and Reed Cassidy is mortally wounded by the Black Falcon, but crashes into the Zeppelin, destroying it. Rawlings reunites with Lucienne before she leaves for Paris. Rawlings\u2019 plane is presented with an eagle, Cassidy's insignia, and he is promoted to Squadron Leader.\n\nAfter escorting another bomber run on the ammunition depot [[Jametz]], in which Lowry is forced to shoot himself when his plane catches fire, Rawlings takes off to exact revenge on the Black Falcon. Rawlings is attacked by multiple enemy planes, but Jensen, who had broken down earlier but decided to keep flying, helps him shoot down all the enemy fighters except the Black Falcon. With the enemy fighters shot down, Rawlings engages in a dogfight with the Falcon. After being bested in combat and wounded, Rawlings comes alongside and fatally shoots the Black Falcon with his pistol. Rawlings and his squadron return to base.\n\nThe film ends by showing what the survivors did after the battle. Jensen flies for the rest of the war; returning to Nebraska, he receives a hero's welcome. Skinner enlists in the [[United States Army|US Army]] but is kept from flying due to his race; he later joins the [[Airmails of the United States|Airmail Service]]. Beagle marries an Italian woman and starts a [[flying circus]]. Rawlings goes to [[Paris]] but does not find Lucienne. He builds one of the largest ranches in [[Texas]], but never flies again.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[James Franco]] as Blaine Rawlings: A Texan faced with the foreclosure of his family ranch in Texas, who decides to enlist after seeing a newsreel of aerial combat in France.\n* [[Martin Henderson]] as Reed Cassidy (a character based upon the real [[Raoul Lufbery]], evident in the references to the squadron mascot, Whiskey the lion): A fellow American, womanizer, traumatized ace pilot, and the pilots' mentor.\n* [[Jean Reno]] as [[Georges Thenault]]: The commander of the [[Lafayette Escadrille]] \n* [[Jennifer Decker]] as Lucienne: A French girl who lives with her orphan nephews and niece. Rawlings's love interest. \n* [[Abdul Salis]] as Eugene Skinner (based on [[Eugene Bullard]], the first African-American military pilot): An African-American boxer, who has been accepted as an athlete in France, and is motivated to \"pay back\" his adopted country.\n* [[Philip Winchester]] as William Jensen: An American man from Lincoln, Nebraska. Coming from a military family, he tries his best to make his family proud.\n* [[Tyler Labine]] as Briggs Lowry: A Dilettante who joins the army because of his overbearing father.\n* [[David Ellison]] as Eddie Beagle: A petty thief who joined up in hopes of evading repercussions.\n* [[Tim Pigott-Smith]] as Mr. Lowry: Briggs's overbearing father.\n* Gunnar Winbergh<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1689148 Gunnar Winbergh's IMDb page] \u2013 Internet Movie Database</ref> as \"The Black Falcon\": A ruthless German Captain Ace pilot, Cassidy's nemesis. Likely inspired by the [[Manfred von Richthofen|Red Baron]].\n\n==Production==\nIn writing the original drafts that formed the basis of the final screenplay, Tony Bill made an effort to incorporate the real-life adventures of a number of American World War I expatriates who served in both the Lafayette Escadrille and the [[Lafayette Flying Corps]], although pseudonyms were used throughout.<ref name=\"Farmer-Cast\">Farmer 2006, pp. 18\u201319.</ref>\n\nThe casting of Franco in an action feature at the time was considered a \"stepping stone\" to his rise as marquee player and movie star.<ref>Farmer 2006, pp. 19\u201320.</ref>\n\nThe film was shot on location in the United Kingdom primarily in spring 2005 although principal photography continued on into the summer.<ref>Farmer 2006, p. 16.</ref> The trench scenes were shot in [[Hatfield, Hertfordshire]], the same location used for ''[[Band of Brothers (TV miniseries)|Band of Brothers]]'' and ''[[Saving Private Ryan]]''. The airfield and aerial shots were filmed on and above [[RAF Halton]] (near Aylesbury) where hangars, mess rooms and officers quarters were built adjacent to Splash Covert Woods. All scenery and props were removed when filming ended. The interior shots of the chateau were filmed at RAF Halton's officers' mess, [[Halton House]]. Some interiors and studio green-screen work were filmed at Elstree Film and Television Studios in Borehamwood, Hertfordshire.<ref>Farmer 2006. p. 50.</ref>\n\nThe film was financed privately outside the standard Hollywood studio circuit by a group of filmmakers and investors, including producer [[Dean Devlin]] and pilot David Ellison, son of [[Oracle Corp.]] founder [[Larry Ellison]]; both spent more than $60 million of their own money to make and market \"Flyboys\".\n\nThe [[Nieuport 17]]s featured in the film included four replicas built by Airdrome Aeroplanes, an aircraft company based outside of [[Kansas City, Missouri]]. The other aircraft used were a mix of authentic aircraft (the Nieuport 17 that Franco used throughout filming was an original combat aircraft from Kermit Weeks' collection in Florida, specially brought over for the film)<ref name=\"Farmer 2006, p. 20\">Farmer 2006, p. 20.</ref> and replicas including Nieuport 17s, a sole [[Sopwith 1 1/2 Strutter]] and a number of [[Fokker Dr.I]] replicas.<ref>Farmer 2006. pp. 21\u201322, 50.</ref>\n\nIn preparing for the starring role, Franco took flying lessons. All the other main actors, except Jean Reno, were filmed in actual aircraft in anticipation of using the aerial footage in final scenes. (Reno pointedly refused the offer, with a \"No thanks, I'm afraid of flying.\" admission). Very little other than Franco's closeups in a cockpit ultimately made it to the screen.<ref>Farmer 2006, p. 53.</ref>\n\n==Historical accuracy==\n''Flyboys'' has been widely criticized for its lack of historical accuracy.<ref>Phillips, Michael.

Retrieved: August 24, 2008.</ref>\n\nVarious details of World War I fighter aircraft technology shown in the film were inaccurate. For example, the aircraft engines in the CGI scenes are pictured as not moving. On the [[rotary engines]] used in some early aircraft, the engine case and cylinders rotated, with the crankshaft bolted to the airframe. The spinning of the cylinders improved cooling and allowed for fewer parts, making the engine simpler and lighter.  The propeller was attached to the crankcase (the opposite of [[radial engines]]). One operating rotary engine appears in a scene that takes place in the repair hangar. The Nieuport and Fokker aircraft used in the movie are flying replicas built with new radial engines, due to the unavailability of original-type rotary engines. This detail can be briefly seen in the final combat when the black Fokker is taking off after Rawling's ground attack at the German airfield.<ref name=\"Farmer 2006, p. 20\"/>\n\nIn the scene where Beagle is rescued, some of the German soldiers in the trench were shown wearing the [[Pickelhaube]]. By 1916, the helmet was no longer in use by frontline soldiers. It had been replaced with the [[Stahlhelm]], which significantly reduced the number of head injuries suffered by German soldiers.\n\nIn many scenes with Lucienne, Rawling's aircraft has a British [[roundel]] rather than a French one, which have red at the outer border.\n\nAnother error is that the American pilots are operating the [[Nieuport 17]], while the Germans are operating the [[Fokker Dr.I]], which entered front line service some time after the Nieuport 17 was no longer operational.<ref>[http://www.centennialofflight.gov/essay/Aerospace/earlyengines/Aero4.htm \"Early Aircraft Engines.\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080920064531/http://centennialofflight.gov/essay/Aerospace/earlyengines/Aero4.htm |date=September 20, 2008 }} ''U.S. Centennial of Flight'', 2003. Retrieved: August 24, 2008.</ref>\n\nThe singular use of Fokker Triplanes, which were not in widespread operational use, is contentious and  almost every Triplane was also painted red in the film, indicating that the Triplane was in Jasta 11, the \"all-red\" unit. Despite this the remaining pre-production aircraft, designated Dr.I, were delivered to Jasta 11 and Idflieg issued a production order for 100 triplanes in September, followed by an order for 200 in November 1917. On the director/producer commentary track for the DVD release, Producer Dean Devlin noted that they were aware the predominant use of red triplanes was historically inaccurate, but wanted to give clear visual signals to the audience to enable them to easily distinguish friend from foe in the aerial sequences.<ref>Bill, Tony and Dean Devlin. \"Special Features: Audio Commentary.\" ''Flyboys'' (DVD: Full Screen).

Livesey was charged and convicted with fraudulently claiming \u00a330,000.00 in benefits. Livesey had served three years in the British [[Army Catering Corps]]. His claims of service in Northern Ireland, the Falklands conflict and that he was a curator of The Imperial War Museum were not true.{{citation needed|date=May 2020}}\n\nIn the film, the [[RMS Aquitania|RMS ''Aquitania'']] is depicted as a luxury liner; however, in early 1914, she was converted to use as an armed merchant cruiser, and by 1915 had been put into use as a troop transport ship, painted with dazzle style [[Dazzle camouflage|camouflage]]; however, the film might have used it to demonstrate the style of transport ships during the war.<ref>Mancini, Louis.
