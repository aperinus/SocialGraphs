Sanders]], [[Karen Young (actress)|Karen Young]] and [[Danielle Harris]]. The film was released by Universal Pictures on December 6, 1996, in the United States, and on December 26 in the United Kingdom. It received mixed reviews and grossed $159 million worldwide.<ref>{{Cite web|date=1996-12-06|title=Rambo Meets Red Cross as 'Daylight' Breaks Loose|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1996-12-06-ca-6145-story.html|access-date=2021-07-11|website=Los Angeles Times|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nIn [[upstate New York]], a waste management firm loads barrels of toxic waste onto trucks, intending to illegally dispose of them at a site in [[New Jersey]]. They are shown heading into a tunnel beneath the [[Hudson River]] along with several commuters, including struggling playwright Maddy Thompson, a bus of juvenile offenders, a vacationing family, an elderly couple with a dog, and sporting goods retailer Roy Nord. Meanwhile, a gang of grunges grabs gems from a gem buyer after mugging him and takes his car to escape the [[NYPD]] by racing into the tunnel. The gang force their way through the north tube traffic where the driver loses control and smashes through a security booth and into one of the trucks, causing it to detonate, and resulting in a [[sympathetic detonation]] of the remaining trucks. The tunnel entrances cave in, and a devastating fireball sweeps through the tunnel, incinerating the majority of the motorists within it.\n\nAbout to enter the Manhattan end of the tunnel, former New York City Emergency Medical Services Chief Kit Latura, now working as a taxi driver, witnesses the fireball erupting from the entrance. While racing to help whoever he can, he runs into an old EMS colleague who tells him that the tunnel is severely damaged and could collapse if any wrong moves are made. Kit then checks with tunnel administrators and finds that most of the old exits have been sealed off or are considered unsafe. Kit makes his way into the tunnel through the ventilation system, risking his life as the massive fans can only be slowed down for a short time.\n\nA group of survivors band around Nord, who believes he can find a way out through the mid-river passage, a service corridor running between the north and south tubes. Kit arrives and warns Nord that the passage could come down at any moment, but Nord dismisses the possibility. Kit barely escapes as the passage collapses, killing Nord and causing another explosion which kills a juvenile offender.\n\nWater begins seeping in from the river above, and Kit uses an explosive to stop the leak. Police officer George Tyrell returns from investigating the Manhattan end and is crushed under a truck as the road shifts. The group manages to free him before he can drown, but he is left with a broken neck. The water level continues to rise, and the angry survivors confront Kit. He claims he can slow it down but not stop it, as the clean-up effort on the Manhattan side of the tunnel is causing water to enter their side. Kit recalls that there are sleeping quarters beside the tunnels (leftover from the tunnel's construction) and asks George how to access them. Kit finds one by swimming under a security booth and leads the group to this area, but George has to be left behind. He gives Kit a bracelet intended for his girlfriend Grace and tells him to \"get them to daylight.\"\n\nEleanor, one of the elderly survivors, is distressed that her late son's dog Cooper is missing. She refuses to go on, then suddenly yet quietly passes away, presumably from [[hypothermia]]. The group moves to another room as the first one floods, convincing Eleanor's husband Roger to come with them. As they reach the top of an old wooden staircase, Kit notices Cooper swimming in the water below and dives down to rescue him, passing him up to one of the survivors, but a beam falls and destroys the lower half, sending Kit into the water. Maddy tries to help Kit up, but she falls as well, as more of the staircase is knocked down. Kit orders the rest of the group to leave. The majority of the group escape through a manhole into daylight while the corridor caves in behind them, leaving Kit and the hysterical Maddy behind in the rising water.\n\nKit and Maddy swim around looking for a possible way out, with the main highway tunnel now almost completely submerged. Kit realizes he will have to use his explosives to cause a \"blow out\" and rip the tunnel roof open. A mass of mud crushes Kit and Maddy tries to pull him out. The blast forces Maddy towards the surface, but Kit gets stuck in the mud. Maddy finds a barely conscious Kit and keeps him afloat as a boat discovers them offshore. Lying on a stretcher, Kit sees Grace in the crowd and hands her George's bracelet. Maddy insists on riding with him in the ambulance to which Kit replies, \"On one condition: We gotta take the bridge.\"\n\n==Cast==\n<!--- Cast and order per opening tombstone credits, roles per closing credits scroll --->\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Sylvester Stallone]] as Chief Kit Latura, a disgraced former New York City Emergency Medical Services (EMS) chief who tries to save the survivors trapped inside the tunnel.

[[J.F. Lawton]], who a few years earlier wrote the very successful ''Die Hard'' rip-off ''[[Under Siege]]'' (1992), wrote the original spec script for ''High Roller'', which he sold to Savoy Pictures for $1 million against $2,5 million in July 1995. The project got some attention after it was reported how Savoy signed Stallone for a paycheck of $20 million. Savoy also wanted Stallone to star in another film they were working on titled ''Firestorm'', which would have been about a firefighter who goes into a forest fire to save a female senator who gets kidnapped by an escaped convict. But pretty soon after Stallone got attached to that project as well, Savoy went bankrupt. The original script by Chris Soth was later bought by 20th Century Fox and was re-written by other writers before it was finally made into ''[[Firestorm (1998 film)|Firestorm]]'' starring [[Howie Long]], which turned into box office bomb. J.F Lawton's original ''High Roller'' spec also went through  \"tug of war\" between several other studios who were trying to buy the rights for it in August 1996, but it still never got made.<ref>https://gointothestory.blcklst.com/background-on-sale-of-3m-spec-script-bright-9edbca89b953?gi=6685ff1ba7 \"Title: High Roller - Logline: \u201cDie Hard\u201d-type action film set in casino targeted for an extremely hostile takeover by an over the top mobster.

Savoy president Rob Fried said Stallone is expected to decide within the next month whether to go with High Roller or Firestorm, two screenplays recently purchased by Savoy. Stallone has a $20-million holding deal with the studio. High Roller, a screenplay by J.F. Lawton (Pretty Woman), would have him playing an Italian gambler who takes on the Mafia. Firestorm, by newcomer Chris Britton, is about a \"smoke-jumper\" who parachutes into a forest fire to protect a female senator who has been kidnapped by an escaped convict.\"</ref><ref>https://ew.com/article/2009/06/25/hollywoods-high-risk-projects/ \"Savoy Pictures, more or less hitless after two years in business, stunned the industry by signing Sylvester Stallone to star in an as-yet-unchosen film in 1996 for $20 million.

Much like ''High Roller'', it was another ''Die Hard'' rip-off, titled ''No Safe Haven'', and it was described as \"''Die Hard'' (1988) on Martha's Vineyard\". The script for it was written by two first time writers: Drew Yanno (who at the time was a lawyer) and his friend Anthony Borghi (who was a real estate broker). The script was about a disgraced ex-marine who goes back to his home at Martha's Vineyard to patch up the relationship with his mother. At the same time, the U.S. president and his family are vacationing on the island. The island is soon taken over by a militia terrorist group, led by a \"[[David Koresh]]-like cult leader\". While his wife and daughter are kidnapped, the President manages to escape. He and the ex-marine team up to battle the cult militia and save the President's family. The entire film would take place during a storm on the island. The script was apparently liked so much by everyone, in particular the plot idea of the President as a sidekick to the main hero in an action film, that it was on the market for only 24 hours before it was bought by Universal for $300,000 after an eight-hours-long bidding war between the studios for it in August 1995. Yanno and Borghi were going to get an additional $300,000 when the film was made, and they had already started to work on re-writes based on some notes they got from studio and producers when Stallone got attached to star in the film in the ex-marine role. ''No Safe Haven'' was possibly going to be his next film at Universal after ''Daylight''. A few months later, Universal stopped working on the project, and just like ''High Roller'', ''No Safe Haven'' was also never made.<ref>https://gointothestory.blcklst.com/the-definitive-spec-script-sales-list-1991-2012-1995-dec0c549171e?gi=a0f3f3694d81 \"Title: Haven  - Logline: \u201cHaven\u201d tells the story of a former U.S. Marine who returns to Martha\u2019s Vineyard to patch up his relationship with his mother.

This time it's Dennis Yanno, who teaches business law part-time in CSOM and who one day during President Clinton's 1994 trip to Martha's Vineyard lay on one of the island's beaches and thought: What if terrorists cut off the island and kidnapped the First Family? Universal Studios bought the idea, somewhat embellished by Yanno and a collaborator (First Lady and daughter are kidnapped; President escapes to golf course; hooks up with vacationing ex-Marine), for $300,000, with an additional $300,000 to follow if the movie is ever produced. That promise, however distant, emboldened Yanno to leave his law practice. Titled \"No Safe Haven,\" the screenplay is the second by Yanno and his partner. The first was a romantic comedy titled \"Banca's Raviolis\" \u2014 which was good enough to earn them an agent who told them that the money was in action flicks.\"</ref><ref>http://bostonvoyager.com/interview/meet-drew-yanno-drew-yanno-wellesley/ \"A few years later, I was approached by a friend (actually the real estate broker who found the lease space for my law firm) who, after reading that unpublished novel, asked me if I ever considered writing a screenplay. And so I began writing screenplays with this friend. It seemed like an interesting diversion from writing a novel and a fun thing to do while I was practicing. It turned out to be a little more than that as, two years later, our screenplay NO SAFE HAVEN was purchased by Universal Studios after an eight hour bidding war. It was quite an exhilarating experience to get welcomed suddenly into the film world out in Hollywood. I like to joke that we were the hottest screenwriters in Hollywood for about three months.
