It stars [[Jessica Lange]], [[Ed Harris]], [[Ann Wedgeworth]], [[David Clennon]], James Staley, [[Gary Basaraba]], [[John Goodman]], and [[P. J. Soles]].<ref>[https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/sweet-dreams-1985 RogerEbert.com]</ref>\n\nThe film was nominated for [[Academy Award for Best Actress]] ([[Jessica Lange]]).<ref>[https://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/1986 1986|Oscars.org]</ref> For all the musical sequences, Lange lip-synced to the original Patsy Cline recordings.<ref>[https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/1985/10/11/movies/c3ecd3b6-0c29-4ae3-b19d-86a0d45310c2/ The Washington Post]</ref> The soundtrack of the [[Sweet Dreams (soundtrack)|same name]] was released in September 1985.\n\n==Plot==\nPatsy Cline ([[Jessica Lange]]) is unhappily married and playing small-time gigs in the tri-state area consisting of [[Virginia]], [[West Virginia]], and [[Maryland]] when she meets Charlie Dick ([[Ed Harris]]), whose charm and aggressive self-confidence catch her attention. Patsy is married but is planning to divorce. After her divorce, Patsy and Charlie marry, and she is free to pursue music, and, later, focus on raising their children. After Charlie gets drafted into the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]], Patsy focuses on singing more, and after joining forces with manager Randy Hughes, Patsy becomes a rising star on the country music scene.\n\nHowever, Patsy's success fuels her self-confidence, much to Charlie's annoyance, and he becomes increasingly physically and emotionally abusive as Patsy attempts to assert her independence. Patsy was at the peak of her popularity as one of the first great female stars of country music when she died in a [[1963 Camden PA-24 crash|plane crash]] on March 5, 1963, at the age of 30.\n\n== Production ==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2021}}\nMany actresses wanted the role of Patsy Cline, including Meryl Streep, but she was turned down. This would be one of the infamous three times the actress was  denied a role. Jessica Lange was eventually signed on for the role, and has said that making the film was a very enjoyable experience for her. Lange did not do any of her own singing in the film, instead the actress lip-synced to Cline's original recordings. This practice was notably used 33 years earlier, when [[Susan Hayward]] lip-synced to [[Jane Froman]]'s vocals in 20th Century Fox's production of [[With a Song in My Heart (film)|With A Song In My Heart]]. The film was originally titled I Fall To Pieces, after Cline's signature song, before the producer's eventually changed it to Sweet Dreams.\n\n== Historical Inaccuracies ==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2021}}\nMany events depicted in the film are not accurate to the actual historical events. Leading up to the famous car crash, Patsy was not in fact buying beer, but actually going to pick up material for her mother to make new costumes for her shows. The most blatantly inaccurate sequence is the fatal plane crash that took Cline's life. In the film, the plane is seen striking the side of a mountain and exploding on impact. In reality, the small aircraft crashed into a forest, hitting trees which ripped the plane apart on the way down. It is also important to note that there is no evidence of mechanical issues leading up to the crash, it is more likely that it was simply the heavy fog that caused pilot Randy Hughes to lose control of the plane.\n\nPatsy's mother Hilda Hensley was not a fan of the film, speaking publicly against it in several interviews.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Jessica Lange]] as [[Patsy Cline]]\n* [[Ed Harris]] as [[Charlie Dick]], Patsy's husband\n* [[Ann Wedgeworth]] as [[Patsy Cline#Family|Hilda Patterson Hensley]], Patsy's mother\n* [[David Clennon]] as Randy Hughes, Patsy's manager and pilot of the ill-fated aircraft in which they, Cowboy Copas and Hawkshaw Hawkins were killed\n* James Staley as Gerald Cline, Patsy's first husband\n* [[Gary Basaraba]] as Woodhouse\n* [[John Goodman]] as Otis\n* [[P.
