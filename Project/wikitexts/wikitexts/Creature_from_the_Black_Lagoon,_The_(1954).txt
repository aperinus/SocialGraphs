Ross|Arthur Ross]] and a story by [[Maurice Zimm]]. It stars [[Richard Carlson (actor)|Richard Carlson]], [[Julie Adams|Julia Adams]], [[Richard Denning]], [[Antonio Moreno]], [[Nestor Paiva]], and [[Whit Bissell]]. The film's plot follows a group of scientists who encounter a [[List of piscine and amphibian humanoids|piscine amphibious humanoid]] in the waters of the [[Amazon rainforest|Amazon]]; the Creature, also known as the [[Gill-man]], was played by [[Ben Chapman (actor)|Ben Chapman]] on land and by [[Ricou Browning]] underwater. Produced and distributed by [[Universal-International]], ''Creature from the Black Lagoon'' premiered in [[Detroit]] on February 12, 1954, and was released on a regional basis, opening on various dates.\n\n''Creature from the Black Lagoon'' was filmed in [[Stereoscopy|three dimensions (3D)]] and originally [[Movie projector|projected]] by the [[Polarized 3D system|polarized light method]]. The audience wore viewers with gray polarizing filters, similar to the viewers most commonly used today. Because the brief 1950s 3D film [[fad]] had peaked in mid-1953 and was fading fast in early 1954, many audiences actually saw the film \"flat\", in two dimensions (2D). Typically, the film was shown in 3D in large downtown theaters and flat in smaller neighborhood theaters. In 1975, ''Creature from the Black Lagoon'' was released to theaters in the red-and-blue-glasses [[anaglyph 3D]] format, which was also used for a 1980 home video release on [[Betamax|Beta]] and [[VHS]] [[Videotape#Home video|videocassettes]].<ref name=\"indepth\"/>\n{{TOC limit|limit=2}}\n\n==Plot==\n[[File:Famous Actress Who Later Portrayed an FDA Chemist (FDA 124) (8205683361).jpg|thumb|right|Autographed Julie Adams still, featuring the Creature menacing Kay.]]\nA [[geology]] expedition in the [[Amazon rainforest|Amazon]] uncovers [[fossil]]ized evidence (a skeletal hand with webbed fingers) from the [[Devonian]] period that provides a direct link between land and sea animals. Expedition leader Dr. Carl Maia orders his two assistants to stay in camp while he visits the [[marine biology]] institute.\n\nCarl reunites with his friend and former student, [[Ichthyology|ichthyologist]] Dr. David Reed. David works at an aquarium in California, but more recently, he has been a guest at Carl's institute in Brazil to study [[lungfish]]. David persuades his boss, the financially minded Dr. Mark Williams, to fund a return expedition to the Amazon to look for the remainder of the skeleton.\n\nSoon after Carl leaves camp, a [[List of piscine and amphibian humanoids|piscine amphibious humanoid]], a living member of the same species from which the fossil originated, becomes curious about the expedition's camp. When its sudden appearance frightens the assistants, they panic and attack, and in response, the enraged Creature kills them both. \n \nThe group goes aboard the tramp steamer ''Rita'', captained by crusty Lucas. The expedition consists of David; Carl; Mark; David's girlfriend and colleague Kay Lawrence; and another scientist, Dr. Edwin Thompson. When they arrive at the camp, they discover Carl's assistants have been killed while he was away. Lucas suggests it was likely done by a [[jaguar]], but the others are unsure.\n\nA further excavation of the area where Carl found the fossil turns up nothing. Mark is ready to give up the search, but David suggests that perhaps thousands of years ago, the part of the embankment containing the rest of the skeleton fell into the water and was washed downriver, broken up by the current. Carl says the tributary empties into a [[lagoon]]. Lucas calls it the \"Black Lagoon\", a paradise from which no one has ever returned. The scientists decide to risk it, unaware that the [[Amphibian|amphibious]] \"Gill-man\" that killed Carl's assistants has been watching them.\n\nTaking notice of the beautiful Kay, the creature follows the ''Rita'' all the way downriver to the Black Lagoon. Once the expedition arrives, David and Mark go diving to collect rock samples from the lagoon floor. After they return, Kay goes swimming and is stalked underwater by the Gill-man, who then gets briefly caught in one of the ship's drag lines. Although it escapes, the Creature leaves a claw behind in the net, revealing its existence.\n\nSubsequent encounters with the Gill-man claim the lives of Lucas's crew members, before the Creature is captured and locked in a cage aboard the ''Rita''. It escapes during the night, attacking Edwin, who was guarding it. Kay smashes the Creature with a lantern, driving it off, but Edwin is severely injured. Following this incident, David decides they should return to civilization. Mark, who is obsessed with capturing (or killing) the Creature, objects. As the ''Rita'' tries to leave, they find the Gill-man has blocked the lagoon's entrance with fallen logs. While the others attempt to remove the logs, Mark is mauled to death while trying to capture the Creature single-handed underwater. The Gill-man then abducts Kay and takes her to its cavern lair. David, Lucas, and Carl chase after the Creature, and Kay is ultimately rescued. The Creature is riddled with bullets before retreating to the lagoon, where its body sinks into the watery depths.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Ricou Browning in his movie costume at Wakulla Springs (15055100304).jpg|thumb|[[Ricou Browning]] played the \"Gill-man\" in the underwater scenes of ''Creature from the Black Lagoon'' (1954), ''[[Revenge of the Creature]]'' (1955), and ''[[The Creature Walks Among Us]]'' (1956).]]\n* [[Richard Carlson (actor)|Richard Carlson]] as Dr. David Reed\n* [[Julie Adams|Julia Adams]] as Kay Lawrence\n* [[Richard Denning]] as Dr. Mark Williams\n* [[Antonio Moreno]] as Dr. Carl Maia\n* [[Nestor Paiva]] as Captain Lucas\n* [[Whit Bissell]] as Dr. Edwin Thompson\n* Bernie Gozier as Zee\n* Henry Escalante as Chico\n* [[Ben Chapman (actor)|Ben Chapman]] as the Gillman (on land)\n* [[Ricou Browning]] as the Gillman (underwater)\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Ginger Stanley Weeki Wachee Springs, Florida 1951.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Ginger Stanley]] did underwater stunts in the first two films.<ref>[http://www.floridamemory.com/items/show/70434 \"Portrait of Ginger Stanley sitting on a diving board - Weeki Wachee Springs, Florida\".] ''State Archives of Florida''.

Alland wrote story notes titled \"The Sea Monster\" 10 years later, using ''[[Beauty and the Beast]]'' as inspiration. In December 1952, [[Maurice Zimm]] expanded this into a treatment, which [[Harry Essex]] and Arthur Ross rewrote as ''The Black Lagoon''. Following the success of the 3D film ''[[House of Wax (1953 film)|House of Wax]]'' in 1953, [[Jack Arnold (director)|Jack Arnold]] was hired to direct the film in the same format.<ref name=horror>Vieira 2003, pp. 141\u2013143.</ref>\n\nThe designer of the approved Gill-man was [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Disney]] animator [[Milicent Patrick]], though her role was deliberately downplayed by [[make-up artist]] [[Bud Westmore]], who for half a century received sole credit for the creature's conception.<ref name=\"Mostri\">Ferrari 2003, p. 287.</ref> Jack Kevan, who worked on ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'' (1939) and made [[prosthesis|prosthetics]] for amputees during [[World War II]], created the [[bodysuit]], while Chris Mueller Jr. sculpted the head.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}\n\nBen Chapman portrayed the Gill-man for the majority of the scenes shot at [[Universal City, California]]. The on-water scenes were filmed at Park Lake on the Universal back lot. The costume made sitting impossible for Chapman for the 14 hours of each day that he wore it, and it overheated easily. Due to these difficulties, Chapman often stayed in the studio's back-lot lake, frequently requesting to be hosed down. He also could not see very well while wearing the headpiece, which caused him to scrape Julie Adams' head against the wall when carrying her in the [[grotto]] scenes.\n\nRicou Browning played the Gill-man in the underwater shots, which were filmed by the [[second unit]] in [[Wakulla Springs]], [[Florida]].<ref name=horror/> While filming underwater, Browning reportedly held his breath for up to four minutes at a time.<ref name=\"Rizzo 2013\">{{cite web|url=https://www.ocala.com/story/news/local/2013/07/18/a-silver-springs-story-ricou-browning-was-the-creature/31923591007/|title=A Silver Springs story: Ricou Browning was the Creature|last=Rizzo|first=Marian|date=July 18, 2013|website=[[Star\u2013Banner]]|access-date=July 25, 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"McBrayer 2021\">{{cite web|url=https://www.fangoria.com/original/the-immortal-creature-ricou-browning/|title=The Immortal Creature: Ricou Browning|last=McBrayer|first=Mary Kay|date=November 19, 2021|website=[[Fangoria]]|access-date=April 7, 2022}}</ref> In a 2013 interview, Browning clarified: \"If you're not doing anything at all, four minutes is possible, but not if you're moving in the water.

Eisner was inspired to shoot on location by the film ''[[Fitzcarraldo]]'', and the boat set had been built. Eisner continued to rewrite the script, which was to be a summer blockbuster full of \"action and excitement, but [still] scary\". Eisner spent six months designing the new incarnation of the Gill-man with Mark McCreery (''[[Jurassic Park (film)|Jurassic Park]]'', and [[Davy Jones (Pirates of the Caribbean)|Davy Jones]]' designer). The director said the new design was \"very faithful to the original, but updated\" and that the Gill-man would still remain sympathetic.<ref>Rotten, Ryan.
