After telling his wife Diane the news, they eventually get a phone call from their daughter, Alice, and son-in-law, Phil, asking them to babysit the children while they leave for an entrepreneur convention in [[Hilton Head, South Carolina]]. Problems arise as Artie and Diane\u2019s parenting skills collide with Alice and Phil's [[helicopter parent]]ing. After learning of the children's various problems, such as Harper's high achievement syndrome, Turner's [[stutter]], and Barker's [[imaginary friend]], Carl the Kangaroo, Artie and Diane try to make them their new best friends. Later that night, everyone goes to the fictional Chinese restaurant, Healthy Tiger for dinner. Artie shows Barker the proper way to eat Chinese food, which is to mix everything together, but all that does is anger Barker and makes him hate Artie, going so far as to call him \"Evil Fartie\", and then it ends up resulting in chaos for the entire family. The next morning, Alice and Phil leave for their trip.\n\nAlice returns home early when her boss gives her an assignment to redesign the website for the [[X Games]]. Artie uses this to his advantage, as he arranges an interview for the role of sports commentator. He even takes Turner to speech class, where he accidentally ends up upsetting Turner. To try and make him feel better, Artie and Turner watch the movie ''[[Saw (2004 film)|Saw]]'', which Alice and Phil did not allow Turner to watch because he was too young. Artie also gives Turner and Barker cake, which Alice disapproves of because she doesn\u2019t let her children eat sugary food. Diane and Alice take Harper to the mall to buy her a dress for her upcoming violin recital. Harper practices her violin at a music studio, where her teacher forces her to practice more. Artie gets hit in his crotch at Turner's baseball practice by Ivan, Turner's bully, because he didn't find the rules to be fair because they're trying to let all the kids win and removing the three strikes and you're out rule, while most of the parents in the crowd agree on his opinion, and that since he already had three strikes, he was already out, which causes the bully to get angry with him. Afterwards, Diane tells Alice that they'll never be good grandparents if she doesn't give them a chance to do so. Alice leaves to join Phil in Hilton Head.\n\nDiane and Artie take the children to the symphony, but Artie and Barker have to catch up because Artie has to go to the bathroom for a poo, and Artie has to sing an embarrassing song to help Barker poop, which the other guys in the bathroom enjoy listening to. They make it to the symphony, but Barker runs around the place because he says that he and Carl found it boring. Artie has to catch up to him, and nearly spanks him in the behind in front of a public audience, who all gasp in shock. At home, Diane scolds him for what he did. Later, Artie lets Barker skip school to take him to a skate park where his job interview is being held. Artie manages to place Barker's life in danger when Barker nearly gets hurt by a skateboard ridden by [[Tony Hawk]] after urinating on the halfpipe, causing him to slip and get hurt, which later is shown on the news. Later that day, Diane berates Artie for letting Turner hit Ivan (a bully at his school), when Artie was trying to teach him a lesson about self-confidence and standing up to bullies. Artie has a discussion with Turner and shows him the [[Shot Heard 'Round the World (baseball)|Shot Heard 'Round The World]] event. Meanwhile in Hilton Head, Alice and Phil eat at a bar while watching news footage of Barker and Artie's incident on TV, before returning to Atlanta. Later in the evening, everyone plays [[kick the can]] until Diane gets a [[bloody nose]]. Barker says that they must go out and play again because of Carl. Barker says that Carl has been hit by a car. Eventually, the tension comes to a head as Alice disagrees with Diane's letting Harper attend a party the night before a violin recital. The family holds a funeral for Carl.\n\nAlice eventually reconciles with Artie and Diane, and she allows Harper to withdraw from the recital. Turner later takes Harper\u2019s place on stage and overcomes his stutter by reciting the commentary from the [[Shot Heard 'Round the World (baseball)|Shot Heard 'Round The World]]. Afterwards, Artie and Diane successfully reconnect with their grandchildren, and Artie takes up a new job as a commentator for an Atlanta [[Little League Baseball]] team alongside Turner.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Billy Crystal]] as Artie Decker\n* [[Bette Midler]] as Diane Decker\n* [[Marisa Tomei]] as Alice Decker-Simmons\n* [[Tom Everett Scott]] as Phil Simmons\n* [[Bailee Madison]] as Harper Simmons\n* [[Joshua Rush]] as Turner Simmons\n* [[Kyle Breitkopf]] as Barker Simmons\n* [[Gedde Watanabe]] as Mr. Cheng\n* [[Rhoda Griffis]] as Dr. Schveer\n* [[Jennifer Crystal Foley]] as Cassandra\n* [[Tony Hawk]] as Himself\n* [[Steve Levy]] as Himself\n* [[Linda Cohn]] as Herself\n\n==Release==\nThe film was released Christmas Day 2012, in the United States and Canada and on Boxing Day 2012, in Australia, the United Kingdom, and Ireland.
