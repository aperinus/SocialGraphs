The film stars [[John Cusack]], [[Ray Liotta]], [[Amanda Peet]], [[Alfred Molina]], [[Clea DuVall]] and [[Rebecca De Mornay]].\n\nLoosely based on [[Agatha Christie]]'s 1939 [[whodunit]] ''[[And Then There Were None]]'', the film follows ten strangers in an isolated hotel, who are temporarily cut off from the rest of the world, and are mysteriously killed off one by one. Several events which take place in the hours before the characters' arrival are introduced at key moments in the film using [[reverse chronology]] structure, and in a parallel story, a murderer awaits a verdict at a crucial trial that will determine whether he will be executed for his crimes.\n\nThe film grossed $90 million. It received polarized reviews from critics at the time of release, but has since slowly garnered a cult following.\n\n==Plot==\nA convict named Malcolm Rivers awaits execution for a vicious mass murder that took place at an apartment building. Journals belonging to Malcolm are discovered misfiled in the case evidence, not introduced during the trial. Malcolm's psychiatrist, Dr. Malick, and his defense attorney argue to use the evidence to prove Malcolm's insanity.\n\nMeanwhile, ten strangers find themselves stranded in a torrential rainstorm at a remote [[Nevada]] motel, run by Larry Washington. The group consists of an ex-cop, now limousine driver, Ed Dakota; Caroline Suzanne, a washed-up, irritable actress; Officer Rhodes, who is transporting convicted murderer Robert Maine; Paris Nevada, a sex worker; newlyweds Lou and Ginny Isiana; and the York family, George, Alice (who was severely injured when Ed accidentally hit her with his limo), and their nine-year-old son, Timmy.\n\nSuzanne is killed by an unknown assailant. Ed discovers Suzanne's head in a dryer, along with the number 10 motel key. Maine is suspected to be the killer as he has escaped. Lou and Ginny get into a fight and Lou is murdered next.\n\nAt the hearing, Malcolm's diaries indicate that Malcolm suffers from extreme [[dissociative identity disorder]], harboring eleven distinct personalities. His defense attorney argues that he is unaware of his crimes, which is in violation of existing [[United States Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] rulings on capital punishment. Dr. Malick is introducing the concept of integrating the personalities of someone with dissociative identity disorder as Malcolm is brought in.\n\nWhile taking photos of Lou's crime scene, Ed finds the number 9 key in Lou's hands. He begins to suspect that the killer is counting down and targeting them in order. Maine fails to escape the motel area, and is subdued by Rhodes and Ed. Maine is killed next. Rhodes and Ed find the number 8 key next to his body, and harass Larry, who takes Paris hostage. Paris wrestles him off, causing Larry to attempt to escape in his truck, but he accidentally crushes George against a dumpster as he tries to save Timmy from being run over.\n\nRhodes ties Larry to a chair, and orders the other guests to stay until dawn. Larry convinces Paris and Ed that he is not the perpetrator by telling them how he ended up at the motel. Alice, still in bed, is checked on and presumably has died from her injuries, but Rhodes finds the number 6 key. George's body is recovered and the number 7 key is found in his pocket, which confuses the others.\n\nEd tells Ginny and Timmy to flee in a car but it explodes. The last four survivors discover that the bodies of all the previous victims have disappeared. Paris has a mental breakdown, revealing her birthday on May 10; it transpires that all eleven people were born on May 10 \u2014 which is also Malcolm's birthday, and the day he committed the murders.\n\nEd checks their ID cards in the office, discovering that each one of them is named after a state, and that their birthdays all match. With Dr. Malick calling out to him, Ed finds he is at the hearing, but is confused as to why he is there. Dr. Malick explains that he is one of the personalities that Malcolm Rivers created as a child. Learning one of the personalities committed the murders, Ed is instructed to \"go back\" to the motel to try to eliminate them.\n\nAs Ed returns to the motel, Paris finds convict-transportation files for both Maine and Rhodes in the police car, revealing Rhodes is a criminal acting as an officer. Rhodes attacks Paris, but she is saved by Larry, who is shot to death by Rhodes. Finally believing Rhodes to be the murderous personality, Ed goes after him and the two men end up shooting each other fatally, leaving only Paris still alive.\n\nWith the homicidal personality removed, Malcolm's execution is stayed and he is ordered to be placed in a [[mental institution]] under Dr. Malick's care. In Malcolm's mind, Paris settles down in her hometown of [[Frostproof, Florida]]. As she tends to her orange grove, she discovers the number 1 key buried in the dirt, and finds Timmy behind her. It is revealed Timmy orchestrated all of the deaths at the motel, including faking his death. Timmy kills Paris, while Malcolm strangles Malick, causing the van that is en route to the mental institution to swerve off the road and stop before Timmy's voice repeats the poem \"[[Antigonish (poem)|Antigonish]]\" by [[William Hughes Mearns]] one more time.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[John Cusack]] as Edward \"Ed\" Dakota, a limousine driver and a former Los Angeles police officer\n* [[Ray Liotta]] as Samuel Rhodes, a correctional officer transporting convicted murderer Maine\n* [[Amanda Peet]] as Paris Nevada, a sex worker leaving Las Vegas to buy a citrus grove in Florida\n* [[John Hawkes (actor)|John Hawkes]] as Larry Washington, the motel manager\n* [[Clea DuVall]] as Virginia \"Ginny\" Isiana, a superstitious newlywed\n* [[William Lee Scott]] as Lou Isiana, Ginny's husband\n* [[Rebecca De Mornay]] as Caroline Suzanne, an '80s Hollywood TV actress chauffeured by Ed\n* [[Leila Kenzle]] as Alice York, a wife and mother who is injured in a car collision\n* [[John C.

''Identity'' is a rarity, a movie that seems to be on autopilot for the first two acts and then reveals that it was not, with a third act that causes us to rethink everything that has gone before. Ingenious, how simple and yet how devious the solution is.\"<ref>Ebert, Roger (April 25, 2003). [http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/identity-2003 \"''Identity'' (2003)\"]. ''Chicago Sun-Times''.

No, what ''Identity'' is guilty of most is bad timing\u2014it simply gives away too much, too soon. At about the halfway mark (if not much sooner), the film's big \"twist\" will finally dawn on you (and if it doesn't, they'll end up coming right out and saying it five minutes later anyway).
