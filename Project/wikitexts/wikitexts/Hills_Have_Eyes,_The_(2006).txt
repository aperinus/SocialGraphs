It was written by filmmaking partners [[Alexandre Aja]] and [[Gr\u00e9gory Levasseur]] of the French horror film ''[[High Tension]]'', and directed by Aja. The film stars [[Aaron Stanford]], [[Kathleen Quinlan]], [[Vinessa Shaw]], [[Emilie de Ravin]], [[Dan Byrd]], [[Robert Joy]], and [[Ted Levine]] and follows a family that is targeted by a group of cannibalistic mutants after their car breaks down in the desert.\n\nThe film was released theatrically in the [[United States]] and [[United Kingdom]] on March 10, 2006. It earned $15.5 million in its opening weekend in the U.S., where it was originally rated [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system|NC-17]] for strong gruesome violence, but was later edited down to an R-rating. An unrated DVD version was released on June 20, 2006.\n\n==Plot==\nRetired detective Bob Carter and his wife Ethel are travelling from [[Cleveland]] to [[San Diego]] through the New Mexico desert for their silver wedding anniversary; with them are their three children, Lynn, Brenda, and Bobby, Lynn's husband Doug and their baby daughter Catherine, and their two [[German Shepherd]]s, Beauty and Beast. They stop at a gas station where the elderly attendant suggests a different route through the hills, claiming it will save them a few hours. Not long after, their tires are punctured by a hidden spike strip, causing the truck and trailer to crash.\n\nBob and Doug set off in opposite directions to find help while the rest of the family stay by the trailer. Beauty escapes and, when Bobby chases her into the hills, he finds her mutilated corpse. Horrified, he flees back to the trailer but falls off the hill on the way, knocking himself unconscious. A timid female mutant [[List of Mutants in The Hills Have Eyes#Ruby|Ruby]] protects him from her brother [[List of Mutants in The Hills Have Eyes#Goggle|Goggle]]. Meanwhile, Bob arrives back at the gas station. Upon searching the station, he finds newspaper clippings detailing various disappearances in the area after recent [[Nuclear weapons testing|nuclear testings]] at a [[Mining community|mining town]] by the US government that caused the mutants' deformities. He confronts the attendant who then commits suicide. Bob attempts to flee in an abandoned car but is attacked by the mutant leader [[List of Mutants in The Hills Have Eyes#Papa Jupiter|Papa Jupiter]].\n\nAfter Bobby is found by Brenda, Doug returns after heading towards the interstate and found a huge crater filled with numerous abandoned cars and other belongings. When being pursued by Papa Jupiter, Bobby confesses his story to Doug and Lynn, just as [[List of Mutants in The Hills Have Eyes#Pluto|Pluto]] and [[List of Mutants in The Hills Have Eyes#Lizard|Lizard]] infiltrate the trailer. They attack and rape Brenda, who has stayed in the trailer with Catherine, while using a distraction of [[Combustion|immolating]] Bob to a tree to divert the others. When Lynn and Ethel return to the trailer, Lizard shoots both of them before abducting Catherine and escape with Pluto. Doug and Bobby return to discover the carnage; Lynn and Ethel die shortly afterwards.\n\nThe next morning, Doug, along with Beast, set out to rescue Catherine. He comes across an abandoned nuclear testing village through the miner town's cave system but is knocked unconscious by [[List of Mutants in The Hills Have Eyes#Big Mama|Big Mama]]. Awakening in an ice box, he escapes and encounters [[List of Mutants in The Hills Have Eyes#Big Brain|Big Brain]] who reveals the mutants' origins to him. Pluto appears and attacks Doug but he manages to gain the upper hand and kills Pluto with his own axe before killing another mutant, [[List of Mutants in The Hills Have Eyes#Cyst|Cyst]]. After ordering Lizard to kill Catherine, Big Brain is mauled to death by Beast. Ruby manages to take the baby from Lizard and escapes through the hills.\n\nBack at the trailer, Brenda and Bobby build an explosive trap, which they set off when Brenda is attacked by Jupiter. Meanwhile, Doug catches up with Ruby but Lizard attacks them before Ruby can hand Catherine over. A struggle ensues and Doug manages to defeat him with Cyst's shotgun. Ruby then gives Doug his daughter back. Lizard, still alive, aims the shotgun at Doug but Ruby tackles Lizard off a cliff, sending them both falling to their deaths.\n\nBobby and Brenda find Jupiter wounded from their trap and Brenda finishes him off with a pickaxe before the siblings are reunited with Doug, Catherine, and Beast. As the survivors of the Carter family embrace, an unknown mutant watches them from afar through binoculars.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Aaron Stanford]] as Doug Bukowski\n* [[Kathleen Quinlan]] as Ethel Carter\n* [[Vinessa Shaw]] as Lynn Carter-Bukowski\n* [[Emilie de Ravin]] as Brenda Carter\n* [[Dan Byrd]] as Bobby Carter\n* [[Tom Bower (actor)|Tom Bower]] as Gas Station Attendant\n* [[Billy Drago]] as Papa Jupiter\n* [[Robert Joy]] as Lizard\n* [[Ted Levine]] as Big Bob Carter\n* [[Desmond Askew]] as Big Brain\n* [[Ezra Buzzington]] as Goggle\n* [[Michael Bailey Smith]] as Pluto\n* Laura Ortiz as Ruby\n* Maisie Camilleri Preziosi as Catherine Bukowski\n* [[Greg Nicotero|Gregory Nicotero]] as Cyst\n* Ivana Turchetto as Big Mama\n* Judith Jane Vallette as Venus\n* Adam Perrell as Mercury\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\nAn international co-production film between The United States, France and Morocco. [[Wes Craven]], director and writer of the original film, considered a remake after he saw the success of other horror remakes such as ''[[The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (2003 film)|The Texas Chainsaw Massacre]]'' and ''[[The Amityville Horror (2005 film)|The Amityville Horror]]''. The search then began for filmmakers to helm the project. Marianne Maddalena, Craven's long-time producing partner, came across [[Alexandre Aja]] and his art director/collaborator Gr\u00e9gory Levasseur who had previously made the French slasher film ''[[High Tension]]''. After showing the film to Craven and the rest of the production crew, they were impressed with the pair. Craven commented that they \"demonstrated a multi-faceted understanding of what is profoundly terrifying\" and \"After viewing the film and then meeting the film makers, I knew I wanted to work with them.\"<ref name=\"Production\">{{cite web| title= The Hills Have Eyes Production PDF| publisher= 20th Century Fox| url= http://media.movieweb.com/galleries/3346/notes.pdf| access-date= 2007-08-22| url-status= dead| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20070930210129/http://media.movieweb.com/galleries/3346/notes.pdf| archive-date= 2007-09-30}}</ref> Aja and Levasseur then began to re-write the story in what was the pair's first American production. Initially the remake was setup at [[Dimension Films]] as part of Craven's overall deal with [[Miramax]],<ref name=\"DimsensionHills\">{{cite news|url=https://variety.com/2004/film/markets-festivals/dimension-heading-back-to-hills-1117899637/|title= Dimension heading back to 'Hills'    |publisher=Variety|access-date=October 20, 2021}}</ref> Dimension then put the film into turnaround where it was acquired by Fox Searchlight.<ref name=\"FoxHills\">{{cite news|url=https://variety.com/2005/film/features/fox-searchlight-eyes-pic-1117920777/|title=  Fox Searchlight 'Eyes' pic   |publisher=Variety|access-date=October 20, 2021}}</ref>\n\nDirector Aja and art director Gr\u00e9gory Levasseur chose not to film in the original's filming location of [[Victorville, California]], and instead scouted many locations for filming including [[Namibia]], [[South Africa]], [[New Mexico]], and [[Mexico]]. The two settled on [[Ouarzazate]] in [[Morocco]], which was also known as \"the gateway to the Sahara Desert\".<ref name=\"Production\"/>\n\nThe film is set in New Mexico, and strongly implies that a large number of atmospheric nuclear weapon tests were performed in that state. In fact, the only atmospheric nuclear detonation in New Mexico was the [[Trinity (nuclear test)|Trinity test]], the first test of a nuclear device conducted on July 16, 1945. The United States carried out most of its atmospheric nuclear weapons tests at the [[Nevada Test Site]] and in the [[Marshall Islands]] at the lagoons of [[Bikini Atoll|Bikini]] and [[Enewetak Atoll|Eniwetok]], between 1946 and 1962. The theatrical poster shows Vinessa Shaw's character prone, with a mutant hand on her face.\n\nDuring the opening sequence, flashes of deformed children are shown. These children are victims of [[Agent Orange]] infamous for it's use during the [[Vietnam War]].\n\n===Effects===\nPrior to filming, Aja and Levasseur had already conceived an idea for the mutants' appearance. \"We based all our descriptions and directions on real documents, pictures and footage that we found on the effects of nuclear fallout in [[Chernobyl]] and [[Hiroshima]]\", explains Aja. ''The Hills Have Eyes'' utilized the K.N.B. EFX Group Inc. who had done previous work on films such as ''[[The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe|The Chronicles of Narnia]]'' (for which they were nominated for an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]]) and ''[[Sin City (film)|Sin City]]''.\n\nK.N.B. spent over six months designing the mutants, first using 3D designer tools, such as [[ZBrush]], allowing them to use a computer to generate their sculptures. After prosthetics were made, they could be fitted to the actors before filming. Robert Joy, who plays the mutant Lizard, explained, \"Every day, these amazing artists took more than three hours to transform me into something that could only be found in a nightmare.\"<ref name=\"Production\"/>\n\nK.N.B. artist [[Greg Nicotero|Gregory Nicotero]] was also made a cameo as Cyst, the mutant with the halo headgear.\n\nJamison Goei and his team, who had done previous work on ''[[Hellraiser: Hellseeker]]'' and ''[[Halloween: Resurrection]]'', had done over 130 visual effects for the film. A large part of that was digitally constructing the testing village, which in actuality was only one built street with others digitally added. The team also warped the mutant's faces slightly, which is shown mostly in the character of Ruby.\n\nPapa Jupiter displays no deformities. However, as shown in \"The Making Of\", Papa Jupiter appears to have a large [[parasitic twin]] attached to his upper left torso. The young children of the film had their deformities added by CGI, with the exception of Ruby, who had a combination of CGI and makeup.\n\n===Casting===\nThe casting process began with the selection of [[The Silence of the Lambs (film)|''The Silence of the Lambs'']]' [[Ted Levine]] as the character Big Bob. Levine was also a fan of the film ''High Tension''. Afterward, [[Kathleen Quinlan]] was cast as Ethel in her first role starring in a horror film (despite appearing in ''[[Twilight Zone: The Movie]]'' and ''[[Event Horizon (film)|Event Horizon]]''). Next, [[Aaron Stanford]] was cast as Doug Bukowski who \"undergoes the most radical transformation of anyone in the Carter family\".<ref name=\"Production\"/> Stanford even asked not to see any of the mutants in make-up before his character's battle in the testing village so, that way, he'd be truly frightened. When casting Lynn, Doug's wife, Aja wanted to cast [[Vinessa Shaw]] who he had wanted to work with since seeing her in [[Stanley Kubrick]]'s 1999 film ''[[Eyes Wide Shut]]''. Shaw was hesitant to play the role, but after watching ''High Tension'', she agreed, explaining: \"There was such an odd combination of beauty and terror, it felt almost like an art film. So, after meeting with Alex and Greg, I decided to do it.\"<ref name=\"Production\"/> For the role of Brenda, the filmmakers sought a young actress who had relatively little exposure and found it in [[Emilie de Ravin]], who was beginning her rise in the television series ''[[Lost (TV series)|Lost]]''. After de Ravin, [[Dan Byrd]] was cast as Bobby. Byrd had previous genre experience starring in ''[[Salem's Lot (2004 miniseries)|Salem's Lot]]''.\n\nAja then had the six actors arrive in the filming location of [[Morocco]] early to bond together.\n\nWhen casting for the mutants, associate producer Cody Zwieg explained: \"We needed to find actors who could not only perform the stunt work, handle the extensive makeup and perform in that makeup, but who truly could embody the fierce, primal nature of the mutants' way of life.\"<ref name=\"Production\"/> To play the role of Pluto, Aja looked to [[Michael Bailey Smith]], who had been in ''[[A Nightmare on Elm Street 5: The Dream Child]]''. For Lizard, the filmmakers cast [[Robert Joy]], who had made previous genre films such as ''[[Amityville 3-D]]'' and [[George A. Romero]]'s ''[[Land of the Dead]]''. Ezra Buzzington, impressed with the filmmakers, agreed to play the role of Goggle and even watched a documentary about human cultures engaging in [[cannibalism]]. To play the mutant leader, Billy Drago was cast. Drago had previously had a role in [[Brian De Palma]]'s ''[[The Untouchables (film)|The Untouchables]]'' and other horror features. The most difficult mutant to cast was Ruby, who was a \"touch of sweetness to the madness of the mutants.\"<ref name=\"Production\"/> Laura Ortiz was ultimately cast, making her film debut.\n\n==Release==\n\n===Box office===\n''The Hills Have Eyes'' was a commercial success, playing in total 2,521 theaters and taking in its opening weekend $15,708,512.<ref name=\"Box\">{{cite web| title= The Hills Have Eyes| publisher= boxofficemojo.com| url= https://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=hillshaveeyes06.htm | access-date= 2007-08-22}}</ref> The film grossed $41,778,863 in the [[United States]] box office<ref name=\"US\">{{cite web| title= The Hills Have Eyes (2006)| publisher= movieweb.com| url= http://www.movieweb.com/movies/film/46/3346/summary.php | access-date= 2007-08-22 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070812221429/http://www.movieweb.com/movies/film/46/3346/summary.php <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archive-date = 2007-08-12}}</ref> and $70,000,000 worldwide,<ref name=\"Box\"/> surpassing its budget costs by over fourfold.\n\nThe film placed third at the box office during its opening week.<ref name=\"weekly\">{{cite web| title= The Hills Have Eyes - Weekly Box Office Results| publisher= boxofficemojo.com| url= https://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?page=weekly&id=hillshaveeyes06.htm | access-date= 11 July 2015}}</ref> It dropped to fifth after its second week of release, and to eighth after its third week.
