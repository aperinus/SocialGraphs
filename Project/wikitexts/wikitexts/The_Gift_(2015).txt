The film stars [[Jason Bateman]] and [[Rebecca Hall]] as Simon and Robyn Callem, a couple intimidated by a figure from Simon's past played by Edgerton.\n\nIt was released in the United States on August 7, 2015, as the first film released by [[STX Entertainment]]. The film grossed $60 million worldwide on a budget of $5 million and received positive reviews from critics, who praised Edgerton's direction and screenplay, as well as Bateman and Hall's performances.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, summaries should be generic and MUST NOT OVERREACH 400-700 WORDS! As of July 2016, the plot has over 497 words; IT IS NOT RECOMMENDED TO ADD OR EXTEND ANY DETAILS! -->\nA married couple, Simon and Robyn Callem, relocate from [[Chicago]] to a [[Los Angeles]] suburb after Simon takes a new job. They run into Gordon \"Gordo\" Moseley, Simon's old high school classmate. Gordo begins repeatedly dropping in unannounced and delivering gifts, such as bottles of wine and [[koi]] for their pond. His presence makes Simon uncomfortable, but Robyn sees no problem.\n\nGordo invites them and another couple to his large home, but, when the Callems arrive, he tells them the other couple cancelled. He exits abruptly to deal with a work problem, leaving them alone and making Simon suspicious. When Gordo returns, Simon tells Gordo to stay away from them.\n\nThe next day, Robyn finds the koi dead and their dog missing. When Simon drives to Gordo's house to confront him, he discovers the home actually belongs to another couple. In the days following, Robyn begins to suspect that she is not alone in the house, finding faucets on and hearing footsteps. Unable to sleep, she steals prescription pills.\n\nThat night, the dog suddenly returns, and Robyn finds a letter of apology from Gordo in the mail. The message ends with a note to Simon that says Gordo was \"willing to let bygones be bygones\" with regard to an event from years prior, but not anymore. Simon claims he does not know what it refers to.\n\nSimon asks his boss about a promotion and is told that his only competition is his coworker Danny McDonald. Robyn's increasing paranoia while home alone causes her to faint. She wakes up in bed the next morning and finds Simon with her stolen pills, revealing that this was a problem for her in Chicago.\n\nTime passes, things improve, and Robyn becomes pregnant. One day however, she sees Gordo watching her while shopping. Simon's sister tells her that, in high school, Simon and his friend Greg reported that Gordo had been [[Child molestation|molested]] by an older boy, which led to Gordo getting bullied and transferring schools. Robyn discovers that Simon has run background checks on Danny McDonald and Gordo, who has spent his life in and out of prison. She seeks out Greg, who reveals the molestation story was fabricated by Simon, calling him a bully. As a result of the false report, Gordo's father thought Gordo was gay and tried to burn him alive, leading to his arrest for [[attempted murder]] and Gordo being sent to military school. When Robyn asks why Simon would have done such a thing, Greg replies, \"because he could.\"\n\nRobyn confronts Simon but he denies responsibility. At her behest, he tracks down Gordo and delivers a non-apology. Gordo knows Simon is insincere and warns Simon that the past is not done with him yet. Furious, Simon attacks Gordo. He later lies to Robyn, saying Gordo accepted his apology.\n\nSimon is promoted, but at his celebration party, Danny McDonald hurls rocks at his house and accuses Simon of fabricating information and ruining his career in order to get the promotion. Robyn goes into labor and gives birth to a boy. Simon is fired for lying about McDonald, and Robyn tells him that she wants to separate.\n\nSimon returns home to find another gift box, consisting of a key to their house, an audio recording of Simon and Robyn making fun of Gordo, and footage shot from inside their home that shows Gordo standing over Robyn when she had fainted, seemingly about to [[sexual assault|sexually assault]] her. Gordo wears the mask of a monkey (a lifelong fear for Simon) as he touches an unconscious Robyn on the bed before the camera cuts.\n\nAt the same time, Gordo visits Robyn at the hospital with a bandaged eye and his arm in a sling. He tells her that Simon caused his injuries. Simon rushes to the hospital but misses Gordo, who smirks at him as the elevator doors close. Gordo calls Simon to taunt him, refusing to confirm whether or not he raped Robyn and fathered the baby, just as Simon refused to come clean about the molestation story years before. With his marriage over and his career destroyed, Simon breaks down as Gordo watches. Satisfied with his revenge, Gordo walks away, tossing away the sling from his arm.\n\n==Cast==\n<!--- Cast and order per closing tombstone credits, roles per closing credits scroll --->\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Jason Bateman]] as Simon\n* [[Rebecca Hall]] as Robyn\n* [[Joel Edgerton]] as Gordo\n* [[Allison Tolman]] as Lucy\n* [[Wendell Pierce]] as Detective Mills\n* [[Tim Griffin (actor)|Tim Griffin]] as Kevin \"KK\" Keelor\n* [[Beau Knapp]] as Detective Walker\n* Adam Lazarre-White as Ron\n* [[Katie Aselton]] as Joan\n* [[P.J.
