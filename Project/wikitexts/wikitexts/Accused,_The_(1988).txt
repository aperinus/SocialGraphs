Set in [[Washington (state)|Washington state]], but filmed mainly in [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]], the film stars [[Jodie Foster]] as Sarah Tobias, a young waitress, who is [[gang rape]]d by three men at a local bar. With the aid of attorney, Kathryn Murphy ([[Kelly McGillis]]), she sets out to prosecute the rapists as well as the men who [[Solicitation|helped induce the assault]]. [[Bernie Coulson]], [[Leo Rossi]], [[Ann Hearn]], [[Carmen Argenziano]], [[Steve Antin]] and [[Tom O'Brien (actor)|Tom O'Brien]] are featured in supporting roles. \n\n''The Accused'' premiered at the [[39th Berlin International Film Festival]], where it competed for the [[Golden Bear]]. It was released in [[limited release|limited theatres]] on October 14, 1988 by [[Paramount Pictures]] and was highly controversial upon release, mostly due to its graphic representation of gang rape. The film became a critical and commercial success, grossing over $92 million worldwide against a $13 million budget, and was chosen by the [[National Board of Review Awards 1988|National Board of Review]] as the [[National Board of Review: Top Ten Films#Lists|3rd best film of the year]]. Critics praised the film's audacity, the authenticity of the portrayal of its subject matter, and credited it for being one of the first mainstream films to deal with the horrors of rape and its aftermath on a victim's life. Foster's performance marked her breakthrough into adult roles, earning numerous accolades including the [[Academy Award for Best Actress]].<ref>[https://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/1989 1989|Oscars.org]</ref><ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljf4PZeakZ4 Jodie Foster Wins Best Actress: 1989 Oscars]</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nSarah Tobias is brutally gang raped by three men at a local bar while several patrons watch and cheer. District Attorney Katherine Murphy is assigned to the case. Although there is strong physical evidence corroborating Sarah\u2019s rape, Katherine feels that Sarah\u2019s checkered past and flirtatious behavior with the men prior to her attack will jeopardize the case. She agrees to a plea bargain, allowing the three rapists to plead guilty to reckless endangerment, a felony without a sexual offense, and serve nine months in prison. Sarah is angered and betrayed by Katherine\u2019s decision and for having been denied the chance to tell her story. Several months later, Sarah is harassed in a parking lot by one of the men who watched and encouraged her rape. She drives her car into his truck, rendering herself in the hospital. Guilt-ridden, Katherine decides to prosecute the men, who clapped and cheered during Sarah\u2019s assault, for criminal solicitation. If convicted, the rape will go on record, nullifying the plea deal, and her rapists will serve full terms of five years. As the case goes to trial, Sarah is finally able to tell her story of what happened to her that night. As Katherine pores over evidence, she comes across a 911 call in which a young man reported Sarah\u2019s attack. She discovers the caller is Kenneth Joye, a college student who was a witness the night at the bar. Reluctant at first, he agrees to testify for the prosecution, recounting how the accused men cheered and goaded as the rapists brutalized Sarah. The men are found guilty of criminal solicitation, and as a result, her rapists will serve the additional time in prison. A triumphant Sarah leaves the courtroom with Katherine.\n\n==Themes==\nIt is loosely based on the 1983 gang rape of [[Cheryl Araujo]] in [[New Bedford, Massachusetts]], and the resulting trial which received national coverage (and was also the focus of an episode on the 2020 [[Netflix]] documentary series ''[[Trial by Media (TV series)|Trial by Media]]'').<ref>[https://www.esquire.com/entertainment/tv/a32585426/cheryl-araujo-trial-by-media-true-story/ The True Story of Cheryl Araujo's Sexual Assault, as Revisited in Netflix's 'Trial By Media' - Esquire]</ref><ref>[https://www.distractify.com/p/what-happened-at-big-dans 'The Accused' Is Actually Based on This 'Trial by Media' Case - Distractify]</ref> The film explores the themes of [[classism]], [[misogyny]], [[post-traumatic stress disorder]], [[slut shaming]], [[victim blaming]] and [[women's empowerment]].\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Jodie Foster]] as Sarah Tobias\n* [[Kelly McGillis]] as Assistant District Attorney Kathryn Murphy\n* [[Bernie Coulson]] as Kenneth Joyce\n* [[Leo Rossi]] as Cliff 'Scorpion' Albrect\n* [[Ann Hearn]] as Sally Fraser\n* [[Carmen Argenziano]] as Paul Rudolph\n* [[Steve Antin]] as Bob Joiner\n* [[Tom O'Brien (actor)|Tom O'Brien]] as Larry\n* [[Peter Van Norden]] as Paulsen\n* [[Terry David Mulligan]] as Duncan\n* [[Woody Brown (actor)|Woody Brown]] as Danny\n* Tom Heaton as Jesse\n* [[Andrew Kavadas]] as Matt Haines\n* [[Scott Paulin]] as Ben Wainwright\n* [[Tom McBeath]] as Stu Holloway\n* Kim Kondrashoff as Kurt\n* [[Veena Sood]] as Woman Orderly\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\n{{quote box|width=45%|quote=\"Jonathan and I looked at a lot of old films, and we couldn't find one that had explored the subject.

It's a very tough subject.\"|source=\u2014Topor explaining the importance of making the film<ref name=\"Ford\"/>}}\n\nScreenwriter [[Tom Topor]] was inspired to write the film after the trial involving the rape of [[Cheryl Araujo]] became national news.<ref name=\"Ford\">{{cite news|last=Ford|first=Rebecca|title='The Accused' Oral History: A Brutal Rape Scene, Traumatized Actors and Producers' Fights to Make the Movie|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/features/accused-oral-history-a-brutal-rape-scene-traumatized-actors-producers-fights-make-movie-952|access-date=December 5, 2016|website=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=January 16, 2014}}</ref> [[Dawn Steel]] called him to ask if he'd be interested in doing a movie on the subject. [[Sherry Lansing]] and [[Stanley Jaffe]] from [[Paramount Pictures]] were subsequently signed on to produce the film. Topor interviewed 30 rape victims and numerous rapists, prosecutors, defense attorneys and medical professionals.<ref name=\"Ford\"/> [[Jonathan Kaplan]] met with Steel and discussed the possibility of making a film on the subject. The original draft of the script mainly focused on the lawyer's story. However, Kaplan wanted the rape victim to be as prominent as the lawyer; the script also featured a pool table (reflecting the real life incident), but the producers were concerned with being sued, so it was changed to a pinball machine.\n\nFollowing the test screenings, the film received the lowest scores in the history of Paramount. According to Lansing, \"The audience thought that Jodie's character deserved the rape.\"<ref name=\"Ford\"/> Studio executives wanted to put the film on the shelf and were looking for ways to prevent it from being released. Lansing asked for another screening with just women, which was far more successful. Of the 20 women in the room, 18 had experience with rape \u2014 either they or someone they knew had been raped. When tested again months later, it was given one of the highest scores in studio's history.<ref name=\"Ford\"/>\n\n===Casting===\nDue to its hardened themes and graphic screenplay, the studio was already skeptical of making the film and it was essential for the producers to cast a bankable actress in the role of Sarah Tobias. Numerous actresses were offered or considered for the part including [[Kim Basinger]], [[Demi Moore]], [[Jennifer Beals]], [[Meg Tilly]], [[Rosanna Arquette]], and [[Kristin Davis]], but all of them rejected the film due to its gruesome and controversial themes.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Mell |first1=Eila |title=Casting Might-Have-Beens: A Film by Film Directory of Actors Considered for Roles Given to Others |date=2004 |publisher=McFarland |isbn=9780786420179 |page=4}}</ref> Producers [[Sherry Lansing]] and [[Stanley R. Jaffe]] both had serious doubts about casting Foster because they did not think she could be sexual enough for the role of Sarah, also Foster who had recently graduated from [[Yale]] and didn't make any successful films during her time at school, wasn't the prime choice for the producers. Following numerous auditions as well as rejection from various established actresses, she was finally cast in the part.\n\n[[File:KellyMcGillisSept10TIFF.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Kelly McGillis]] was initially offered to play Sarah Tobias, but instead took the role of Kathryn Murphy.]]\n\n[[Jane Fonda]] was initially attached to play attorney Kathryn Murphy but left the project as she found the script exploitative and poorly written.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/439190587|title=Rape Film's Topic|author=[[Marilyn Beck]]|newspaper=[[Victoria Advocate]]|date=April 6, 1987|quote=Jane Fonda bowed out of the part for which McGillis has now been set.}}</ref> [[Ellen Barkin]], [[Michelle Pfeiffer]], [[Sigourney Weaver]], [[Debra Winger]], [[Meryl Streep]] and [[Geena Davis]] were also considered for the part.

She had taken a sabbatical from Hollywood to attend Yale, which was prolonged due to [[John Hinckley]]'s assassination attempt on President [[Ronald Reagan]] (which he carried out as a means to impress Foster with whom he had been obsessed after seeing her in ''[[Taxi Driver]]'') in March 1981. After recovering from the media frenzy surrounding her following the incident, she had experienced a bit of a dry spell upon her return to acting. Most of her films had a lukewarm response both with critics and at the box office. She stated that she would have retired from acting had ''The Accused'' followed suit. Ultimately, the film's success revitalized her career.\n\n===Filming===\n[[Principal photography]] for ''The Accused'' began on April 22, 1987, and wrapped two months later on June 2. Although set in [[Washington (state)|Washington state]], it was filmed mainly in [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]]. The gang rape scene was highly controversial at the time of its release (and still continues to be), as being the longest, most graphic and boldest representation of sexual assault in mainstream cinematic history. It took five days to complete and the filming was a difficult experience for the cast and crew involved. Everyone felt protective of Foster and worried how traumatic the situation could be for her. In an interview, Foster explained that the rape scene was meticulously rehearsed beforehand, so there would be no unpleasant surprises for anyone involved in the actual scene. She has stated that she does not remember filming the scene and completely blacked out and broke blood vessels in her right eye from crying during the shooting of the scene.
