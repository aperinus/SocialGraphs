Please see the talk page for more.--> is a 2015 American [[Epic film|epic]] [[space opera]] film produced, co-written, and directed by [[J.&nbsp;J. Abrams]]. The sequel to ''[[Return of the Jedi]]'' (1983), it is the seventh film in the \"[[Skywalker Saga]]\". Set thirty years after ''Return of the Jedi'', ''The Force Awakens'' follows [[Rey (Star Wars)|Rey]], [[Finn (Star Wars)|Finn]], [[Poe Dameron]], and [[Han Solo]]'s search for [[Luke Skywalker]] and their fight in the [[Resistance (Star Wars)|Resistance]], led by General [[Leia Organa]] and veterans of the [[Rebel Alliance]], against [[Kylo Ren]] and the [[First Order (Star Wars)|First Order]], a successor to the [[Galactic Empire (Star Wars)|Galactic Empire]]. The [[ensemble cast]] includes [[Harrison Ford]], [[Mark Hamill]], [[Carrie Fisher]], [[Adam Driver]], [[Daisy Ridley]], [[John Boyega]], [[Oscar Isaac]], [[Lupita Nyong'o]], [[Andy Serkis]], [[Domhnall Gleeson]], [[Anthony Daniels]], [[Peter Mayhew]], and [[Max von Sydow]]<!-- Order is based on the poster's billing block.-->.\n\nThe film was announced after [[The Walt Disney Company]]'s acquisition of [[Lucasfilm]] in October 2012. The film is the first ''[[Star Wars]]'' film to not extensively involve franchise creator [[George Lucas]], who only served as a [[creative consultant]] in the early stages of production. ''The Force Awakens'' was produced by Abrams, his longtime collaborator [[Bryan Burk]], and Lucasfilm president [[Kathleen Kennedy (producer)|Kathleen Kennedy]]. Abrams and [[Lawrence Kasdan]], co-writer of the [[Star Wars original trilogy|original trilogy]] films ''[[The Empire Strikes Back]]'' (1980) and ''Return of the Jedi'', rewrote an initial script by [[Michael Arndt]]. [[John Williams]], composer for the previous episodic films, returned to compose the [[Star Wars: The Force Awakens (soundtrack)|score]]. [[Principal photography]] began in April 2014 on a $259\u2013306&nbsp;million budget and concluded the following November. Filming took place on sets at [[Pinewood Studios]] in England, and on location mainly in Abu Dhabi, Iceland, and Ireland.\n\n''The Force Awakens'' premiered in Los Angeles on December 14, 2015, and was released in the United States on December 18. It was positively received by critics for its screenplay, direction, lead performances, action sequences, musical score, special effects, and emotional weight, although some critics found the film too similar to ''[[A New Hope]]'' (1977). The film grossed $2&nbsp;billion worldwide, [[List of box office records set by Star Wars: The Force Awakens|breaking various box office records]] and becoming the [[List of highest-grossing films in the United States and Canada|highest-grossing film in the United States and Canada]], the [[2015 in film#Highest-grossing films|highest-grossing film of 2015]], and the [[List of highest-grossing films|<!--This is the PEAK POSITION the film achieved NOT the CURRENT.

Please check the word count before making any additions. -->\n\nThirty years after the Galactic Civil War,{{efn|Depicted in the [[Star Wars original trilogy|original ''Star Wars'' trilogy]]}} the [[First Order (Star Wars)|First Order]] has risen from the fallen [[Galactic Empire (Star Wars)|Galactic Empire]] and seeks to end the [[New Republic (Star Wars)|New Republic]]. The [[Resistance (Star Wars)|Resistance]], backed by the Republic and led by General [[Leia Organa]], opposes the First Order. Leia searches for her brother, [[Luke Skywalker]], who has gone missing.\n\nOn the desert planet [[Jakku]], Resistance pilot [[Poe Dameron]] receives a map to Luke's location from Lor San Tekka. [[Stormtrooper (Star Wars)|Stormtroopers]] commanded by [[Kylo Ren]] raid the village and capture Poe, ultimately killing San Tekka and slaughtering the villagers. Poe's droid, {{nowrap|[[BB-8]]}}, escapes with the map and encounters a scavenger named [[Rey (Star Wars)|Rey]]. Kylo tortures Poe using [[the Force]] and learns of {{nowrap|BB-8}}. Stormtrooper {{nowrap|[[Finn (Star Wars)|FN-2187]]}}, disillusioned by the First Order, frees Poe, and they escape in a stolen [[TIE fighter]]. Upon learning that {{nowrap|FN-2187}} has no other name, Poe gives him the name \"Finn\". As they head to Jakku to retrieve {{nowrap|BB-8}}, a First Order [[Star Destroyer]] shoots them, and they crash-land. Finn survives and finds only Poe's jacket in the wreck, leading to the assumption of his death. Finn encounters Rey and {{nowrap|BB-8}}, but the First Order tracks them and launches an airstrike. Rey, Finn, and {{nowrap|BB-8}} steal the ''[[Millennium Falcon]]'' and escape the planet.\n\nThe ''Falcon'' is discovered and boarded by [[Han Solo]] and [[Chewbacca]]. Gangs seeking to settle debts with Han attack, but the group escape in the ''Falcon''. At the First Order's [[Starkiller Base]], a planet converted into a superweapon, [[Supreme Leader Snoke]] approves [[General Hux]]'s request to use the weapon for the first time on the New Republic. Snoke questions Kylo's ability to deal with emotions surrounding his father, Han Solo, whom Kylo states means nothing to him.\n\nAboard the ''Falcon'', Han determines that BB-8's map is incomplete. He then explains that Luke attempted to rebuild the [[Jedi|Jedi Order]], but exiled himself when an apprentice turned to the dark side, destroyed the temple, and slaughtered the other apprentices. The crew travels to the planet [[Takodana]] and meets with [[cantina]] owner [[Maz Kanata]], who offers help getting {{nowrap|BB-8}} to the Resistance. The Force draws Rey to a secluded vault, where she finds the [[lightsaber]] once belonging to Luke and his father, [[Anakin Skywalker]]. She experiences disturbing visions, denies the lightsaber at Maz's offering, and flees into the woods, confused and terrified. Maz gives Finn the lightsaber for safekeeping.\n\nStarkiller Base demonstrates its power by simultaneously destroying the New Republic capital of [[Hosnian Prime]] and four of its neighboring planets, leaving the Resistance on their own. The First Order attacks Takodana in search of {{nowrap|BB-8}}. Han, Chewbacca, and Finn are saved by Resistance [[X-wing fighter]]s led by Poe, who survived the crash. Leia arrives at Takodana with {{nowrap|[[C-3PO]]}} and reunites with Han. Meanwhile, Kylo captures Rey and takes her to Starkiller Base, but she resists his mind-reading attempts. Snoke orders Kylo to bring Rey to him. Discovering she can use the Force, Rey escapes using a [[Jedi mind trick]] on a Stormtrooper guard.\n\nAt the Resistance base on [[D'Qar]], BB-8 finds [[R2-D2]], who had been inactive since Luke's disappearance. As Starkiller Base prepares to fire once more, the Resistance devises a plan to destroy it by attacking its thermal oscillator. Using the ''Falcon'', Han, Chewbacca, and Finn infiltrate the facility, find Rey, and plant explosives. Han confronts Kylo, calling him by his birth name Ben, and implores him to abandon the dark side. Kylo seems to consider this, but ultimately kills Han instead. Devastated, Chewbacca shoots Kylo and sets off the explosives, allowing Poe to attack and destroy the base's thermal oscillator.\n\nThe injured Kylo pursues Finn and Rey into the woods. Kylo incapacitates Rey, and Finn uses the lightsaber to duel Kylo, but is overcome due to his lack of experience. Rey awakens, takes the lightsaber, and channels the Force to defeat Kylo in a duel; they are then separated by a fissure as the planet's surface begins to splinter. Snoke orders Hux to evacuate and bring Kylo to him to complete his training. Chewbacca rescues Rey and the unconscious Finn, and they escape aboard the ''Falcon''. As the Resistance forces flee, Starkiller Base implodes. {{nowrap|R2-D2}} awakens and reveals the rest of the map, which points to the oceanic planet [[Ahch-To]].\n\nRey, Chewbacca, and R2-D2 travel to Ahch-To on the ''Falcon''. Rey finds Luke atop a cliff on a remote island. Without a word, she presents him with his father's lightsaber.\n\n==Cast==\n{{see also|List of Star Wars characters{{!}}List of ''Star Wars'' characters|List of Star Wars cast members{{!}}List of ''Star Wars'' cast members}}\n[[File:Star Wars - The Force Awakens cast by Gage Skidmore.jpg|thumb|The cast of ''Star Wars: The Force Awakens'' at the 2015 [[San Diego Comic Con International]]]]\n<!--Please do NOT change the order of the cast below.
