However, he is stuck with his grandson, Billy, because his mother, Kimmie, violated her parole and is going back to jail. Kimmie urges Irving to make sure Billy makes it to his father. Irving and Billy get on a video call with Billy's deadbeat dad, Chuck, and instructs Irving to take Billy down to Raleigh, North Carolina by 2 P.M. Sunday.\n\nTo make money, Irving sells his late wife's belongings, and later calls over 2 men to get her dead body into the trunk of his car. Irving and Billy hit the road, and Billy is hungry, so Irving pulls over to a nearby market. He tries to flirt with a woman as Billy goes on a ride that does not work. Irving tries the ride and it springs off its base.\n\nMiffed, Irving tries to ship Billy to North Carolina through the post office, but his attempt is not successful. After, he goes to play Bingo, leading to shenanigans, as Billy wanders off asking a random man to be his dad.\n\nBilly gets hungry again, so the two go to a supermarket. Irving shoplifts and makes himself and Billy a sandwich. The two are then halted by staff.\n\nIrving and Billy stop at a motel, and Irving goes to a black men strip club so he could get women while they are aroused. He starts stripping as his testicles hang out of his underwear, driving everyone in the club insane.\n\nAs they approach North Carolina, Irving tries to use Billy to find a woman to hook up with, but they all turn him down. They drive to a diner where Irving crashes into a large penguin statue, where a customer who promotes the diner commands him to fix it. They go in the diner and try to entertain each other by farting, but Irving accidentally defecates on the wall and they leave.\n\nBilly gets hungry yet again and Irving takes him to a church where a wedding reception is taking place. During a group photo, Irving swipes a glass of champagne, causing the whole tower of glasses to collapse, and he ends up falling on top of the table and into the wedding cake, crashing onto the floor.\n\nIrving drives Billy to a bar where they are meeting Chuck. Chuck is speaking with a member of a biker organization called Guardians of the Children, which assists abused children. Irving goes in the bar and asks him to make sure that Billy is taken care of, and bids Billy farewell. As Irving drives away, he immediately starts to miss Billy and drives back to the bar to get Billy back. Chuck's bad parenting is noticed by the G.O.C. and thus Irving successfully gets Billy as the members hold Chuck back.\n\nTo celebrate, Irving and Billy crash a beauty pageant after spotting a flyer for it on their road trip. After, Irving drives up to a bridge where he and Billy finally get rid of Ellie's body by throwing it into a river and proceed to go fishing.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Bad Grandpa cast (cropped).jpg|upright|thumb|L\u2013R: Jeff Tremaine, Jackson Nicoll and Johnny Knoxville at a screening for the film]]\n* [[Johnny Knoxville]] as Irving Zisman<ref name=\"comingsoon1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.comingsoon.net/news/movienews.php?id=107218|title=The Trailer for Jackass Presents: Bad Grandpa is Here!|date=July 31, 2013|website=ComingSoon.net|access-date=August 1, 2013}}</ref>\n* [[Jackson Nicoll]] as Billy Zisman-Muskie<ref name=\"comingsoon1\"/>\n* Greg Harris as Chuck Muskie\n* [[Georgina Cates]] as Kimmie Zisman\n* Kamber Hejlik as Doctor\n* Jill Kill as Pageant Reporter \n* Madison Davis as [[Juggalo]] Girl\n* George Faughnan as [[Juggalo]] Guy\n* Grasie Mercedes as Hostess\n* Marilynn Allain as Receptionist\n* Jack Polick as Funeral Worker{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n* [[Spike Jonze]] as Gloria\n* [[Catherine Keener]] as Ellie Zisman\n\n==Production==\nIn March 2012, [[Johnny Knoxville]] discussed the possibility of a fourth ''[[Jackass (TV series)|Jackass]]'' movie, saying \"we're keeping our mind open\" and \"I've got 50\u201360 ideas on top of all the stuff we didn't get to shoot.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.craveonline.com/film/previews/184731-sxsw-interview-johnny-knoxville?start=1|title=SXSW Interview: Johnny Knoxville: On Arnold Schwarzenegger's comeback film The Last Stand, Nature Calls and more Jackass|last=Topel|first=Fred|date=March 14, 2012|website=CraveOnline|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130602082332/http://www.craveonline.com/film/previews/184731-sxsw-interview-johnny-knoxville?start=1|archive-date=June 2, 2013|access-date=May 14, 2013}}</ref> Then in June 2012, it was reported Paramount \"registered several domains for a film that would be called ''Jackass 4: Bad Grandpa''.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.slashfilm.com/paramount-registers-domains-jackass-4-bad-grandpa/|title=Paramount Registers Domains For 'Jackass 4: Bad Grandpa'|last=Lussier|first=Germain|date=June 7, 2012|website=SlashFilm|access-date=June 7, 2012}}</ref> During [[Bam Margera]]'s September 18, 2012 interview on ''[[The Howard Stern Show]]'' about ''Jackass'' he said: \"There's going to be a whole movie about Knoxville's grandpa character.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=//www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1aNT72VekA |title=Howard Stern Show \u2013 Bam Margera's Stalker & Other Tales, Part 1 of 3 |publisher=YouTube |access-date=August 1, 2013}}</ref> The film was officially announced on July 17, 2013, and released on October 25, 2013.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://collider.com/jackass-bad-grandpa-paranormal-activity-5/|title=JACKASS: BAD GRANDPA Set for October 25th; PARANORMAL ACTIVITY 5 Moves to January 3, 2014|last=Goldberg|first=Matt|date=July 17, 2013|website=Collider|access-date=August 1, 2013}}</ref> Knoxville revealed that he and director [[Jeff Tremaine]] had been approached about making a film featuring the Irving Zisman character, but held off as they did not feel a plot consisting of pranking the public would be able to carry an entire film.<ref name=sidekicked/> Eventually, Tremaine and Knoxville came up with a story to structure the pranks around.<ref name=sidekicked/> The film was dedicated to ''Jackass'' cast member [[Ryan Dunn]], who died in 2011.\n\nMuch of ''Bad Grandpa'' was filmed in [[Cleveland]] and [[Columbus, Ohio|Columbus]], Ohio, as well as [[North Carolina]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.joblo.com/movie-news/exclusive-11-interview-bad-grandpa-director-jeff-tremaine|title=Exclusive 1:1 Interview: Bad Grandpa Director Jeff Tremaine!|author=JimmyO|date=October 23, 2013|website=[[JoBlo.com]]|publisher=Joblo Media Inc|access-date=December 12, 2013|quote=We shot in Ohio quite a bit, in Columbus and Cleveland and North Carolina a lot}}</ref> The first scene shot featured Irving enraging golfers on a Columbus course, where he was working as a groundskeeper. \"At that point all of my hesitancy just washed away,\" Knoxville said. \"We got so much funny stuff that we knew we had something special.\"<ref name=sidekicked/> [[Alterian, Inc.]]'s prosthetic Irving Zisman makeup took three and a half hours to apply to Knoxville every morning.<ref name=sidekicked/> Five hours were needed for scenes requiring Knoxville to remove his shirt.<ref name=sidekicked/> [[Jackson Nicoll]] was cast as Billy, Irving Zisman's grandson.
