It stars [[Carol Kane]], [[Colleen Dewhurst]], [[Tony Beckley]] and [[Charles Durning]]. The film derives its story from the classic folk legend of \"[[the babysitter and the man upstairs]]\".\n\nThe film has developed a large [[cult following]] over time because of the first 20 minutes, now consistently regarded as one of the scariest openings in [[film history]].<ref>{{cite web | url=https://horrornews.net/134459/horrifying-opener-scenes-ever-see/ | title=The Most Horrifying Opening Scenes (You Should Totally See!) | date=August 2019 }}</ref> The first 12 minutes of [[Wes Craven]]'s ''[[Scream (1996 film)|Scream]]'' (1996) is an homage to the opening of ''When a Stranger Calls''.\n\nThe film was released in the United States on September 28, 1979, by [[Columbia Pictures]]. It was commercially successful, grossing $20 million at the box office. It received a mixed critical reception, with many praising the opening scene and performances, but criticism for its writing and lack of scares. It was followed by the 1993 made-for-cable sequel ''[[When a Stranger Calls Back]]'' and [[When a Stranger Calls (2006 film)|a remake]] in 2006.\n\n==Plot==\nJill Johnson is babysitting the children of Dr. Mandrakis at his home. When the children are asleep, Jill receives a telephone call from a man who asks her if she has checked the children. Jill initially dismisses the call as a practical joke. However, he calls again and again, the calls increasing in frequency and threat level, and Jill becomes frightened. She calls the police, who tell her to keep the perpetrator on the line long enough for them to trace the call. Jill receives one final call from her harasser. Immediately after the conversation, the police phone to inform her that the calls are coming from a line located somewhere inside the house. Jill sees the intruder's shadow. Unbeknownst to her, an English merchant seaman named Curt Duncan killed the children shortly after Jill arrived. He leaves Jill unharmed and, after his trial, is sent to a psychiatric facility.\n\nSeven years later, Duncan escapes from the psychiatric facility. Dr. Mandrakis hires John Clifford, who investigated the earlier murders but is now a private detective, to find Duncan. Not knowing Clifford is after him, the homeless Duncan is beaten after harassing a woman, Tracy, in a downtown bar. Duncan follows Tracy to her apartment and she takes pity on him. She tries to be nice to him while getting him to leave, hoping this will be the last she sees of him.\n\nMeanwhile, an increasingly obsessed Clifford confides to his friend Lieutenant Garber his intention to kill Duncan rather than have him recommitted. Garber, who was also present at the Mandrakis crime scene, agrees to collaborate. Clifford tracks Duncan to Tracy's residence. He tells Tracy that Duncan literally tore the Mandrakis children apart with his bare hands and Tracy reluctantly agrees to act as bait at the bar that evening in an effort to draw Duncan out. Duncan never appears. After Clifford leaves, however, Duncan comes out of hiding from inside Tracy\u2019s closet. Tracy screams for help and Clifford returns, chasing Duncan from the scene but losing his trail in the streets of downtown Los Angeles.\n\nJill is now married with two young children. One night, she and her husband Stephen go to dinner to celebrate his promotion while their children are babysat by Sharon. While at the restaurant, Jill gets a telephone call and hears Duncan's voice asking again: \"Have you checked the children?\" The police escort Jill back home to discover that everything there is fine.\n\nUpon hearing about the incident, Garber alerts Clifford. Clifford tries to call Jill, but finds that the line is dead in an eerie parallel to Jill's original stalking. Later that night, Jill hears Duncan's voice as the closet door appears to open. She tries to awaken her husband only to realize that the man lying next to her is the intruder. He chases Jill across the room and attempts to kill her, but Clifford arrives in time to shoot Duncan in the chest, killing him. Stephen is found in the closet, unconscious but alive. Their children are safe.\n\n==Cast==\n<!--- Cast and order per opening tombstone credits, roles per closing credits scroll --->\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Charles Durning]] as John Clifford\n* [[Carol Kane]] as Jill Johnson\n* [[Colleen Dewhurst]] as Tracy\n* [[Tony Beckley]] as Curt Duncan\n* [[Rachel Roberts (actress)|Rachel Roberts]] as Dr. Monk\n* [[Ron O'Neal]] as Lt.

However, CARA chair [[Richard Heffner]] then viewed the film and called the board for discussion to consider voting for an R rating instead. Although the theme of a film could potentially be accommodated within a PG rating, Heffner argued that this film's treatment of its theme was too unsettling for most parents to want it to be freely available to unaccompanied children. A majority vote was then received to assign the film its R rating.<ref>{{cite web|first=Richard|last=Heffner|date=1979|title=Oral History: transcript volume 10 - 1979}}</ref>{{full citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of films featuring home invasions]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wikiquote}}\n* {{AFI film|57210}}\n* {{IMDb title|0080130|When a Stranger Calls}}\n* {{Allmovie title|54171|When a Stranger Calls}}\n\n{{When a Stranger Calls}}\n{{Fred Walton}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:When A Stranger Calls}}\n[[Category:1970s crime thriller films]]\n[[Category:1970s mystery thriller films]]\n[[Category:1970s psychological thriller films]]\n[[Category:1970s thriller films]]\n[[Category:1979 films]]\n[[Category:1979 horror films]]\n[[Category:1979 directorial debut films]]\n[[Category:1979 independent films]]\n[[Category:American crime thriller films]]\n[[Category:American detective films]]\n[[Category:American independent films]]\n[[Category:American mystery thriller films]]\n[[Category:American psychological thriller films]]\n[[Category:Columbia Pictures films]]\n[[Category:Features based on short films]]\n[[Category:Films about murderers]]\n[[Category:Films about stalking]]\n[[Category:Films based on urban legends]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Fred Walton (director)]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Los Angeles]]\n[[Category:Home invasions in film]]\n[[Category:Films about telephony]]\n[[Category:When a Stranger Calls (film series)]]\n[[Category:1970s English-language films]]\n[[Category:1970s American films]]"}]}}}}
