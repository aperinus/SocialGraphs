It is the story of three youths who attempt to avenge their rights in a society of criminals and thugs.\n\n==Synopsis==\n\nShin ([[Jo Odagiri]]), a Japanese university student, finds a book with a section about the hazards to be found in New York City. Otherwise leading a boring life, he eagerly heads to New York but soon finds out the hazards are true when he is mugged. Two Japanese-American punks, an outgoing thief named Lee ([[Jai West]]) and his shy sidekick Takeda (Motoki Fukami), help him out after the mugging, and together the three begin a life of excitement and danger. In the end, that gets them in trouble with the police, resulting in a death. Shin ultimately goes back to Japan with a new thirst for life.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Jo Odagiri]] as Shin\n* [[Jai West]] as Lee\n* Motoki Fukami as Takeda\n* [[Hiroyuki Ikeuchi]] as Won\n* Rin Kurana\n* Sayako Hagiwara\n* [[Clark Saturn]]\n\n==Reception==\nCritical reception for the film was mixed to positive.
