The film concerns police officer Edward Malus, whose ex-fianc\u00e9e Willow Woodward informs him that her daughter Rowan has disappeared and asks for his help in her search. When he arrives at the island in the [[Pacific Northwest]] where Rowan was last seen, he suspects something sinister about the [[Modern paganism|neo-pagans]] who live there. The film received negative reviews on [[Metacritic]], and [[Rotten Tomatoes]]' critical consensus calls it unintentionally funny. The film grossed $39 million on a $40 million production budget.\n\n==Plot==\nPoliceman Edward Malus gets news from his ex-fianc\u00e9e, Willow Woodward, that her daughter Rowan is missing. He travels to an island off the coast of [[Washington (state)|Washington state]] where a group of [[Modern paganism|neo-pagans]] lives. The island is led by Sister Summersisle ([[Ellen Burstyn]]), an elderly woman who represents the [[goddess]] they worship. Sister Summersisle explains to Edward that her ancestors had left England to avoid persecution only to settle near Salem and find renewed persecution in the [[Salem witch trials]] before arriving on the island. Sister Summersisle explains that their population is predominantly female, as they choose the strongest stock\u2014evading Edward's concern about the birth of unwanted males. The island's economy relies on the production of local honey, which Edward learns has declined recently.\n\nEdward asks the villagers about Rowan, but they give him evasive answers. He later sees two men carrying a large bag that appears to be dripping blood and finds a fresh, unmarked grave in the churchyard. The grave turns out to contain only a burned doll, but Edward finds Rowan's sweater in the churchyard. At the village school, teacher Sister Rose tries to prevent Edward from seeing the class register. When he sees that Rowan's name has been crossed out, he becomes outraged at the teacher's and Rowan's classmates' lies. Rose insists that Edward talk with her outside. After a short discussion of the island people's view of death, she explains that [[capital punishment]] is used to enforce their laws. Edward asks how Rowan died and Sister Rose tells him, \"She'll burn to death.\" When Edward catches the tense she used, Sister Rose quickly corrects herself: \"She burned to death.\" When Edward questions Willow about the grave, she reveals that Rowan is their daughter together. On the day of the [[fertility rite]], Edward frantically searches the village for Rowan. Disguised in a bear suit, he joins the parade led by Sister Summersisle, which ends at the site of the festival.\n\nRowan is tied to a large tree, about to be burned. Edward rescues her and they run away through the woods, but Rowan leads him back to Sister Summersisle. Sister Summersisle thanks Rowan for her help, and Edward realizes that the search for Rowan was a setup the whole time. It is revealed that Willow, known on the island as Sister Willow, is the daughter of Sister Summersisle and that Willow sealed Edward's fate many years ago, when Sister Willow chose him as a [[human sacrifice]] to restore the island's honey production (after Edward deliberately destroyed the beehives in their crop earlier). The villagers tackle and overpower Edward, viciously breaking his legs to prevent him from escaping and torturing him with live bees (shown in the alternate version). They carry him to an enormous [[wicker man]] where he's hoisted high above the ground and shut inside. Rowan sets fire to the wicker man, and Edward is sacrificed in a giant blaze amid his screams.\n\nSix months later, Sister Willow and Honey go to a bar and meet two policemen, one of them having graduated from the academy. Willow and Honey agree to go home with them.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Nicolas Cage]] as Edward Malus, a police officer\n* [[Ellen Burstyn]] as Sister Summersisle, leader of the cult and Sister Willow's mother\n* [[Kate Beahan]] as Sister Willow Woodward, Edward's ex-fianc\u00e9e\n* [[Leelee Sobieski]] as Sister Honey, one of the cult's leaders\n* [[Frances Conroy]] as Dr. T.H.

Hardy stated Lee would not play the villain as he did in the original ''Wicker Man'', but instead a door-to-door born again Christian preacher who comes to Scotland along with his wife (Redgrave) as they are introduced to the neo-pagan cult. Hardy hoped for filming to begin in Glasgow, Scotland in 2003, but ''The Riding of the Laddie'' would not materialize until years later, when it had undergone many changes to become the film ''[[The Wicker Tree]]''. Universal's remake with LaBute moved forward, who changed the Scots setting to contemporary America.<ref name=\"laddie\" /> The remake rights eventually moved from Universal to [[Millennium Films]].
