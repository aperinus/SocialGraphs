It is the sequel to 2009's {{nowrap|''[[Paul Blart: Mall Cop]]''}}, and stars James in the title role, [[Raini Rodriguez]], and [[Shirley Knight]].\n\nFilming began in April 2014 at the [[Wynn Las Vegas]] casino resort. It was released the following year on April 17, 2015. ''Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2'' was the first film shot on the [[Steve Wynn]] property. It was also the first film to receive Nevada's [[Movie production incentives in the United States|film tax credit]], enacted in 2013, netting the production a $4.3 million return on expenditures. The film was panned by critics and grossed $108 million worldwide at the box office.\n\n==Plot==\nFollowing the events at West Orange Pavilion Mall, Paul Blart is recovering from several misfortunes. His wife Amy divorced him six days into their marriage, and two years later, his mother Margaret was killed after being hit by a milk truck. To feel better, Paul takes pride in patrolling the mall. He receives an invitation to a security officers' convention in [[Las Vegas]] and begins to believe his luck is about to change. His daughter, Maya, discovers that she was accepted into [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]] and plans to move across the country to Los Angeles, but in light of her father's invitation, she decides to withhold the information for now.\n\nAfter arriving in Las Vegas, Paul and his daughter meet the general manager of [[Wynn Las Vegas]], a pretty young woman named Divina Martinez, whom Paul is instantly attracted to. He later learns that she's dating the hotel's head of security, Eduardo Furtillo. Meanwhile, Maya falls in love with the hotel's valet, Lane. A security guard from the Mall of America attending the convention, Donna Ericone, is aware of Paul's earlier heroics in the West Orange Pavilion Mall incident and believes Paul will be the likely keynote speaker at the event. However, Paul discovers that another security guard, Nick Panero, is giving the speech.\n\nIn the midst of the convention, a criminal named Vincent Sofel and a gang of accomplices disguised as hotel employees are secretly plotting to steal priceless works of art from the hotel and replace them with replicas, then sell the real ones at auction. In the meantime, Paul has become overprotective of Maya after discovering her flirting with Lane and spies on their conversations. He is later mocked by Eduardo for his lack of professionalism in an event where hotel security was notified when Maya turns up missing. In an ensuing argument with her father, Maya becomes angry and claims she's attending UCLA despite Paul's wishes that she remain close to home at a junior college.\n\nAt the convention, Paul, Donna, and three other security guards, Saul Gundermutt, Khan Mubi, and Gino Chizetti check out the non-lethal security equipment on display. Later, Paul takes a break in The Garden Of Contemplation, only to face off against a bird while a man playing piano watches. Paul finds Nick drunkenly hitting on a woman at the bar. Paul attempts to defuse the situation and Nick passes out, giving Paul a chance to be the event's speaker. Following the speech, Paul learns about Maya and Lane's situation and rushes to help but abruptly collapses due to his [[hypoglycemia]] that has plagued him for years.\n\nAfter recovering, Paul is able to take down several of Vincent's thugs and gathers intel on the group's intentions. Using non-lethal equipment from the convention, he is able to take out more of Vincent's crew. Meanwhile, Maya and Lane overhear Vincent adamantly refusing an oatmeal cookie due to a severe oatmeal allergy, leading to said cookie being thrown from a window. Working with a team \u2013 Donna, Saul, Khan, and Gino \u2013 Paul is able to clumsily dismantle Vincent's operation, with Maya severely incapacitating Vincent by rubbing oatmeal-infused concealer on his face and Paul finishing Vincent off with an extremely forceful headbutt. Afterward, Paul convinces Divina to be with Eduardo. He also accepts Maya going to UCLA, funding her tuition with the reward he obtained from [[Steve Wynn]] for stopping Vincent. After dropping off Maya at UCLA, Paul falls for a [[mounted police]] officer who reciprocates his advances, but her horse reflexively kicks him into the side of a car.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Kevin James]] as Paul Blart<ref name=\"Kevin\" />\n* [[Raini Rodriguez]] as Maya Blart<ref name=\"deadline-five\" />\n* [[Neal McDonough]] as Vincent Sofel<ref name=\"Neal\" />\n* [[David Henrie]] as Lane<ref name=\"David\" />\n* [[Daniella Alonso]] as Divina Martinez<ref name=\"Daniella\" />\n* [[Loni Love]] as Donna Ericone<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blackamericaweb.com/2014/04/09/loni-love-lands-a-new-role-in-paul-blart-mall-cop-2%E2%80%B2/ |title=Loni Love Lands A New Role In 'Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2\u2032! |publisher=Black America Web |date=2014-04-09 |access-date=2014-07-10}}</ref>\n* [[D.
