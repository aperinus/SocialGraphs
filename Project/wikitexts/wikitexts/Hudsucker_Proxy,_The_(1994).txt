[[Sam Raimi]] co-wrote the script and served as [[second unit]] director. The film stars [[Tim Robbins]] as a na\u00efve but ambitious [[business school]] graduate who is installed as president of a manufacturing company, [[Jennifer Jason Leigh]] as a newspaper reporter, and [[Paul Newman]] as a company director who hires the graduate as part of a [[stock]] scam.\n\nThe script was finished in 1985, but production did not start until 1991, when [[Joel Silver]] acquired the script for [[Silver Pictures]]. [[Warner Bros.]] subsequently agreed to distribute the film, with further financing from [[PolyGram Filmed Entertainment]] and [[Working Title Films]]. Filming at Carolco Studios in [[Wilmington, North Carolina|Wilmington]], [[North Carolina]] lasted from November 1992 to March 1993. The New York City [[scale model]] set was designed by [[Michael J. McAlister]] and [[Mark Stetson]], with further effects provided by [[Framestore|The Computer Film Company]].\n\nUpon its release in March 1994, ''The Hudsucker Proxy'' received mixed reviews from critics and [[Box office bomb|bombed at the box office]], but has since gained a [[cult following]].\n\n==Plot==\nIn December 1958, Norville Barnes, a business college graduate from [[Muncie, Indiana|Muncie]], [[Indiana]], arrives in [[New York City]], looking for a job. He struggles due to lack of experience and becomes a [[mailroom]] clerk at Hudsucker Industries, a large corporation. Soon thereafter, the company's founder and president, Waring Hudsucker, unexpectedly commits [[suicide]] during a business meeting by [[jumper (suicide)|jumping]] out of a top-floor window. Afterward, Sidney J. Mussburger, a ruthless member of the company's [[board of directors]], knowing that Hudsucker Industries' [[bylaws]] call for Hudsucker's stock shares to be sold to the public, suggests a scheme to buy the controlling interest in the company by temporarily depressing the stock price by hiring a clearly incompetent president to run the business.\n\nIn the mailroom, Norville is assigned to deliver a \"Blue Letter\" to Mussburger. The letter is a top-secret communication from Hudsucker, sent shortly before his death. However, Norville does not deliver the letter; instead, he [[Sales presentation|pitches]] Mussburger an invention of his (indicated with no other explanation than a simple drawing of a circle and his cryptic explanation, \"you know: for kids.\"). Believing Norville to be an idiot, Mussburger selects him as a [[Agent (law)|proxy]] for Hudsucker. Across town, Amy Archer, a brassy [[Pulitzer Prize]]\u2013winning reporter for the ''Manhattan Argus'' newspaper, is assigned to write a story about Norville and find out what kind of man he really is. She obtains a job at Hudsucker Industries as his [[personal secretary]], pretending to be yet another desperate graduate from his [[alma mater]] in Muncie. One night, Amy searches the building for clues and meets Moses, who operates the tower's giant clock and knows \"just about anything if it concerns Hudsucker\". He tells her Mussburger's plot, and she takes the story back to her Chief, but he does not believe it.\n\nThe other executives at Hudsucker Industries decide to produce Norville's invention in hopes that it will flop and further depress the company's stock. However, the invention is the [[hula hoop]], which initially fails in obscurity but then becomes an enormous success. Norville allows success to go to his head and becomes yet another uncaring tycoon. Amy, who had fallen for his naive charm, is infuriated over Norville's new attitude and leaves him. Buzz, the eager elevator operator, pitches a new invention: the flexi-straw. Norville dismisses it and fires Buzz. Meanwhile, Aloysius, a Hudsucker janitor, discovers Amy's true identity and informs Mussburger. Mussburger reveals Amy's secret identity to Norville and tells him he will be dismissed as president after the new year. Mussburger also convinces the board that Norville is insane and must be sent to the local psychiatric hospital.\n\nOn [[New Year's Eve]], Amy finds Norville drunk at a [[beatnik]] bar. She apologizes, but he storms out and is chased by an angry mob led by Buzz. Norville escapes to the top floor of the Hudsucker skyscraper and changes back into his mailroom uniform. He climbs out on the ledge, where Aloysius locks him out and watches as he slips and falls off the building at the stroke of midnight. While Norville plummets, Moses stops the building's giant clock, which freezes time. Waring Hudsucker appears to Norville as an angel and tells him to read the Blue Letter (still in Norville's uniform pocket) that was supposed to be delivered to Mussburger: it contains Hudsucker's instructions to transfer his shares to his immediate successor as president, rather than to the public. This would have been Mussburger, but, unaware of this, he proceeded with his scheme to elect Norville. Inside the building's giant clock, Moses fights Aloysius, defeating him. Norville descends safely to the ground. He and Amy reconcile. As 1959 progresses, Mussburger attempts suicide and is sent to an asylum while Norville develops a new invention \"for kids\": another enigmatic circle on a folded sheet of paper that ultimately turns out to be a [[frisbee]].\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Tim Robbins]] as Norville Barnes\n* [[Jennifer Jason Leigh]] as Amy Archer\n* [[Paul Newman]] as Sidney J.

Together, they began writing the script for ''The Hudsucker Proxy'' in 1981,<ref>Muir, p. 77</ref> and continued during the filming of ''[[Crimewave]]'' (1985),<ref>Warren, pp. 101\u2013102</ref> and [[post-production]] on ''[[Blood Simple]]'' (1985), in which Joel and Ethan Coen shared a house with Raimi. The Coens and Raimi were inspired by the films of [[Preston Sturges]], such as ''[[Christmas in July (film)|Christmas in July]]'' (1940) and the Hollywood satire, ''[[Sullivan's Travels]]'' (1941).<ref name=manner/> The sentimental tone and decency of ordinary men as heroes was influenced by films of [[Frank Capra]], like ''[[Mr. Deeds Goes to Town]]'' (1936), ''[[Meet John Doe]]'' (1941), and ''[[It's a Wonderful Life]]'' (1946).<ref>{{cite book|language=it| first= Alessandro |last=Agostinelli |author-link=Alessandro Agostinelli | title = Un mondo perfetto. I comandamenti dei fratelli Coen| publisher=Controluce | page=111 }}</ref> The dialogue is an [[Homage (arts)|homage]] to [[Howard Hawks]]' ''[[His Girl Friday]]'' (1940), while [[Jennifer Jason Leigh]]'s performance as fast-talking reporter Amy Archer is reminiscent of [[Rosalind Russell]] and [[Katharine Hepburn]], in both the physical and vocal mannerisms.<ref name=\"manner\">Levin, pp. 103\u2013118</ref> Other movies that observers found references to include ''[[Executive Suite]]'' (1954) and ''[[Sweet Smell of Success]]'' (1957).<ref name=Fonda/> The brothers had no intention of commenting on or parodying such movies, instead as Ethan said  \"It's the case where, having seen those movies, we say 'They're really fun - let's do one'; as opposed to 'They're really fun- let's comment upon them.'\" Raimi describes the script as \"big-business comedy. It's a return to the very large love story comedies they used to make in the forties and early fifties.\"<ref name=\":1\" /> So the brothers started to pace around their apartment, taking turns on the typewriter, and when they found themselves stuck at a point, Raimi would do all sorts of tricks to get the boys back up. For example, while Ethan is pacing around, he would move things around the apartment so Ethan would be thrown off, he even said he threw firecrackers at them.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nOne film critic described the numerous influences: \"From his infelicitous name to his physical clumsiness, Norville Barnes is a Preston Sturges hero trapped in a Frank Capra story, and never should that twain meet, especially not in a world that seems to have been created by [[Fritz Lang]] \u2013 the mechanistic monstrousness of the mailroom contrasted with the [[Bauhaus]] gigantism of the corporate offices perfectly matches the boss-labour split in ''[[Metropolis (1927 film)|Metropolis]]'' (1927).\"<ref name=Gilliam/> An interviewer proposed that the characters represent [[capitalism]] versus [[labour economics]]. Joel Coen replied: \"Maybe the characters do embody those grand themes you mentioned, but that question is independent of whether or not we're interested in them \u2013 and we're not.\"<ref name=Capital/> ''The Hudsucker Proxy'' presents various [[Motif (narrative)|narrative motif]]s pertaining to the [[Rota Fortunae]] and [[motif (visual arts)|visual motif]]s concerning the shape of circles. This includes Moses' monologue at the beginning, the Hudsucker Clock, Mussburger's wristwatch, the inventions of both the hula hoop and frisbee, as well as Norville and Amy's conversation about [[Karma]].<ref name=Fonda/>\n\nThe first image the Coens and Raimi conceived was of Norville Barnes about to jump from the window of a skyscraper and then they had to figure out how he got there and how to save him.<ref name=\"Bergan\">Bergan, pp. 148\u2013162</ref> The inclusion of the [[hula hoop]] came as a result of a [[plot device]]. Joel remembers, \"We had to come up with something that Norville was going to invent that on the face of it was ridiculous. Something that would seem, by any sort of rational measure, to be doomed to failure, but something that on the other hand the audience already knew was going to be a phenomenal success.\"<ref name=Gilliam/> Ethan said, \"The whole circle motif was built into the design of the movie, and that just made it seem more appropriate.\"<ref name=Gilliam/> Joel: \"What grew out of that was the design element which drives the movie. The tension between vertical lines and circles; you have these tall buildings, then these circles everywhere which are echoed in the plot...in the structure of the movie itself. It starts with the end and circles back to the beginning, with a big flashback.\"<ref name=Gilliam/> It took the Coens and Raimi three months to write the screenplay. As early as 1985, the Coens were quoted as saying that an upcoming project \"takes place in the late Fifties in a skyscraper and is about [[Big Business]]. The characters talk fast and wear sharp clothes.\"<ref name=\"Gilliam\">Woods, pp. 125\u2013135</ref>\n\nDespite having finished the script in 1985, Joel explained, \"We couldn't make ''Hudsucker'' back then because we weren't that popular yet. Plus, the script was too expensive and we had just completed ''Blood Simple'', which was an [[independent film]].\"<ref name=\"Silver\">Woods, pp. 9\u201310, 122\u2013124</ref> After completing ''[[Barton Fink]]'' (1991), the Coens were looking forward to doing a more mainstream film.<ref>{{cite news | author = Juliann Garey | url = https://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,305444,00.html | title = Coen to Extremes | work = [[Entertainment Weekly]] | date = 1993-02-05 | access-date = 2008-11-22}}</ref> ''The Hudsucker Proxy'' was revived and the Coens and Raimi performed a brief rewrite.

Skyscrapers from New York City included the [[Chanin Building]], the [[Fred F. French Building]] and [[One Wall Street, Manhattan]]. \"We took all our favorite buildings in New York from where they actually stood and sort of put them into one neighborhood,\" Gassner continued, \"a fantasy vision which adds to the atmosphere and flavor.\"  First of all, a model had to be created based on the fantasy 1950s New York for the opening shot. So a miniature city was created, as McAlister mentioned that the Coens did not want a realistic reproduction of 1950s New York skyline, instead they wanted a more stylized version of it.<ref name=\":0\" />  So Gassner used the book ''New York in The Forties'' as a reference to create the look for the cityscape. It took three months and 27 crew members to create the miniature city at the scale of 24:1. As for the Hudsucker building, they made it at the scale of 6:1 for closer shots including the long-zoom in of Norville at the beginning. For that scene to be created, it started off with a wide angle shot, moving closer towards Tim Robbins, who was standing in a full sized set, which they inserted inside the shot of the model clock. \u2018Marrying a live-action image with a painted or miniature element was, of course, nothing new, however, in the case of the zoom-in on Robbins from such a distance, keeping the full-size set locked in with the model building, \u2018that was state-of-the-art and the only way to do it was with computers.\u2019 says McAlister.<ref name=\":0\" /> Most of the buildings were created with two sides only, as they will only be seen from the front and the side, and some only needed one side as they were only going to be seen from the front, while the Hudsucker building was made completely three-dimensional.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=Robson/> The work of [[Framestore|The Computer Film Company]] (supervised by [[Janek Sirrs]]) included manipulations of the zoom-in shot of Norville at the beginning, as well as [[computer-generated imagery|CGI]] snow and composites of the falling sequences.<ref name=Robson/>\n\nTo create the two suicide falls, the miniature New York set was hung sideways to allow full movement along the heights of the buildings. McAlister calculated that such a drop would take seven seconds, but for dramatic purposes it was extended to around thirty. Problems occurred when the Coens and cinematographer Roger Deakins decided that these shots would be more effective with a wide-angle lens. \"The buildings had been designed for an 18 mm lens, but as we tried a 14 mm lens, and then a 10 mm, we liked the shots more and more.\"<ref name=Robson/> However, the wider amount of vision meant that the edges of the frame went beyond the fringes of the model city, leaving empty spaces with no buildings. In the end, extra buildings were created from putting the one-sided buildings together and placing them at the edges. Charles Durning's fall was shot conventionally, but because Tim Robbins had to stop abruptly at the camera, his was shot in reverse as he was pulled away from the camera.<ref name=Robson/>\n\nThe skyscraper models created for The Hudsucker Proxy were re-used for ''[[The Shadow (1994 film)|The Shadow]]'', ''[[Batman Forever]]'', ''[[Batman & Robin (film)|Batman & Robin]]'', and ''[[Godzilla (1998 film)|Godzilla]]''.<ref>Cinefex Magazine, issues 63 (Sept 1995), 71 (Sept 1997), and 74 (July 1998).</ref>\n\n===Inspirations===\nIt is thought that the inspiration for the scene in which CEO Waring Hudsucker jumps to his death from the company's building was inspired by the real life suicide of [[Eli M.

The popular music of the time is also reflected in the character of Vic Tenetta (played by [[Peter Gallagher]]), modeled after [[Dean Martin]], who sings \"Memories Are Made of This.\" Additional inspiration comes from [[Aram Khachaturian]]'s ''[[Gayane (ballet)|Gayane]]'' suite. A section from the ballet is used by Burwell for the scene in which Norville and Amy meet for the first time.  The composer's \"Dance of the Young Mountaineers\" is used when a young boy is the first to try the [[hula hoop]], followed by \"[[Sabre Dance]]\" (both from ''Gayane'').<ref name=Robson/>\n\n==Release==\n\n===Commercial reception===\n[[Warner Bros.]] held [[test screening]]s and audience comments were largely mixed. The studio suggested re-shoots, but the Coens, who held [[final cut privilege]], refused because they were very nervous working with their biggest budget to date and were eager for mainstream success. The producers eventually added footage that had been cut and also shot minor [[Pick-up (filmmaking)|pick-up]]s for the ending.<ref name=Silver/> ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' claimed that the pick-ups were done to try to save the film because Warner feared it was going to be a [[box office bomb]]. Joel Coen addressed the issue in an interview: \"First of all, they weren't reshoots. They were a little bit of additional footage. We wanted to shoot a fight scene at the end of the movie. It was the product of something we discovered editing the movie, not previewing it.

From the ''[[Brazil (1985 film)|Brazil]]''-like scenes in the cavernous mail room to the convoluted machinations in the board room, this film is pure satire of the nastiest and most enjoyable sort.

Their camera soars, traveling at the speed of progress, gossip, capitalism itself. Everything races at top speed. The production design, the one thing everyone felt comfortable praising, is a marvel.
