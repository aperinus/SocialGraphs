It follows a young woman whose tranquil life with her husband at their country home is disrupted by the arrival of a mysterious couple.\n\nIt was selected to compete for the [[Golden Lion]] at the [[74th Venice International Film Festival]], and premiered there on September 5, 2017.<ref name=\"Venice\">{{cite web|last1=Tartaglione|first1=Nancy|title=Venice Film Festival Sets Lido Launch For Aronofsky, Clooney, Del Toro, Payne & More As Awards Buzz Begins&nbsp;\u2013 Full List|url=https://deadline.com/2017/07/venice-film-festival-2017-lineup-full-list-1202137114/|website=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|publisher=[[Penske Business Media]]|access-date=July 27, 2017|date=July 27, 2017}}</ref> It was released in the United States on September 15, 2017, by [[Paramount Pictures]], and grossed $44 million worldwide against its $30 million budget. Although it received generally positive reviews, its [[Bible|biblical]] [[Allegory|allegories]] and [[Aestheticization of violence|depiction of violence]] sparked controversy.\n\n==Plot==\nIn the burned-out remains of a large house, Him, an acclaimed poet struggling with [[writer's block]], places a crystal object on a pedestal in his study, and the building morphs into a beautiful home in an [[Garden of Eden|edenic]] landscape. Mother, the poet's wife and muse, awakens in her bed and wonders aloud where Him is. While renovating the house, she occasionally visualizes a beating heart within its walls.\n\nOne day, a stranger called Man turns up at the house, asking for a room and claiming to be a local doctor. Him readily agrees, and Mother reluctantly follows suit. Late that night, Man suffers from [[Retching|dry heaves]] and Mother observes a wound on his side.\n\nMan's wife, Woman, arrives the next day. Mother is increasingly frustrated by her guests, but Him begs her to let them stay, revealing that Man is actually a fan whose dying wish was to meet Him. However, when Man and Woman accidentally shatter the crystal object, which Him had forbidden them to touch, Him becomes angry and boards up his study. Mother tells Man and Woman to leave, but, before they can go, their two sons arrive unexpectedly and fight over Man's will. The oldest son, who is concerned about his impending inheritance, argues and fights with his younger brother, severely wounding him, and the older brother flees after having his head smashed against glass by Him.\n\nHim, Man, and Woman take the injured son to the hospital. Alone in the house, Mother cleans up and follows a trail of blood to a tank of heating oil hidden behind the basement walls. Upon returning, Him informs Mother the son has died.\n\nMother and Him are roused that night when dozens of people arrive unannounced at the house to mourn the dead son. The visitors behave in rude and presumptuous ways that irritate Mother, and she snaps and orders everyone to leave when they break a sink, partially flooding the house. She berates Him for allowing so many people inside and ignoring her needs, but their argument leads to passionate lovemaking. The next morning, Mother announces she is pregnant, which elates Him and inspires him to start writing again.\n\nTime passes. Mother prepares for the arrival of the child and reads Him's beautiful new poem. Upon publication, it is acclaimed and sells well. In celebration, Mother prepares a big dinner, but a group of fans interrupt. Though she asks Him to send them away, he insists he has to be polite and show his appreciation. Mother tries to lock the doors, but droves of fans pour into the house and begin to wreak havoc, stealing things as souvenirs and damaging the house. Due to the adulation he is receiving, Him is oblivious to what is happening, but a disoriented Mother watches helplessly as military forces turn up to battle members of the cult that has sprung up around Him and as his [[publicist]] organizes mass executions. Mother goes into labor and finds Him, who reopens his study, which he had previously boarded up, so she can give birth inside.\n\nThe havoc outside subsides. Him tells Mother his fans want to see their newborn son, but she refuses to hand over the boy. Eventually, she falls asleep, and Him takes the child outside to the crowd, which passes the baby around wildly until he is inadvertently killed. Mother wades into the throng and finds people eating her son's mutilated corpse. Furious, she calls them murderers and attacks them with a shard of glass. They turn on her and beat her savagely until Him intervenes. He begs Mother to forgive them, but she runs down to the basement oil tank and punctures it with a wrench. She ignites the oil, causing an explosion that incinerates the crowd and destroys the house.\n\nHim is unscathed by the inferno, but Mother is horrifically burned. She asks him what he is, and he replies, [[I Am that I Am|\"I am I\"]] and Mother was \"home.\" He asks for her love, and, when she agrees, reaches into her chest and removes her heart, which he tears open to reveal a new crystal object. He places it on the pedestal and the house is transformed back into a beautiful home. A new Mother appears in the bed and awakens, wondering aloud where Him is.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Jennifer Lawrence]] as [[mother Nature|mother]]\n* [[Javier Bardem]] as [[God|Him]]\n* [[Ed Harris]] as [[Adam|man]]\n* [[Michelle Pfeiffer]] as [[Eve|woman]]\n* [[Brian Gleeson (actor)|Brian Gleeson]] as [[Abel|younger brother]]\n* [[Domhnall Gleeson]] as [[Cain|oldest son]]\n* [[Jovan Adepo]] as cupbearer\n* [[Emily Hampshire]] as fool\n* [[Chris Gartin]] as adulterer\n* [[Stephen McHattie]] as zealot\n* [[Kristen Wiig]] as herald\n* [[Amanda Warren]] as healer\n* [[Laurence Leboeuf]] as maiden\n* [[Sarah-Jeanne Labrosse]] as foremother\n}}\n\n==Themes==\n[[File:Upper Rhenish Master - The Garden of Eden (detail) - WGA23764.jpg|thumb|Detail from ''[[Paradiesg\u00e4rtlein]]'' (''Little Garden of Paradise''), by an unknown artist active {{Circa|1410\u201320}}, possibly in [[Strasbourg]].
