Written by Jeunet with Guillaume Laurant, the film is a whimsical depiction of contemporary Parisian life, set in [[Montmartre]]. It tells the story of a shy waitress, played by [[Audrey Tautou]], who decides to change the lives of those around her for the better while dealing with her own isolation. The film features an [[ensemble cast]] of supporting roles, including [[Mathieu Kassovitz]], [[Rufus (actor)|Rufus]], [[Lorella Cravotta]], [[Serge Merlin]], [[Jamel Debbouze]], [[Claire Maurier]], [[Clotilde Mollet]], [[Isabelle Nanty]], [[Dominique Pinon]], [[Artus de Penguern]], [[Yolande Moreau]], [[Urbain Cancelier]], and [[Maurice B\u00e9nichou]].\n\nThe film was theatrically released in France on 25 April 2001 by [[UGC-Fox Distribution]] and in Germany on 16 August 2001 by Prokino Filmverleih. The film received critical acclaim, with praise for Tautou's performance, the cinematography, production design, and writing. ''Am\u00e9lie'' won [[European Film Award for Best Film|Best Film]] at the [[European Film Awards]], four [[C\u00e9sar Awards]], including [[C\u00e9sar Award for Best Film|Best Film]] and [[C\u00e9sar Award for Best Director|Best Director]], and two [[55th British Academy Film Awards|British Academy Film Awards]] including [[BAFTA Award for Best Original Screenplay|Best Original Screenplay]]. It was nominated for five [[Academy Award]]s, including [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film|Best Foreign Language Film]] and [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay|Best Original Screenplay]]. The film was a commercial success, grossing $174.2&nbsp;million worldwide against a budget of $10&nbsp;million, and is one of the biggest international successes for a French film.\n\n==Plot==\nAm\u00e9lie Poulain is born in June 1974 and brought up by eccentric parents who \u2013 incorrectly believing that she has a heart defect \u2013 decide to home-school her. To cope with her loneliness, Am\u00e9lie develops an active imagination and a mischievous personality. When Am\u00e9lie is six, her mother, Amandine, is killed when a suicidal Canadian tourist jumps from the roof of [[Notre-Dame de Paris]] and lands on her. As a result, her father Rapha\u00ebl withdraws more and more from society. Am\u00e9lie leaves home at the age of 18 and becomes a waitress at the [[Caf\u00e9 des 2 Moulins]] in [[Montmartre]], which is staffed and frequented by a collection of eccentrics. She is single and lets her imagination roam freely, finding contentment in simple pleasures like dipping her hand into grain sacks, cracking [[cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e]] with a spoon, and [[skipping stones]] along the [[Canal Saint-Martin]].<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2001/aug/15/artsfeatures2 ''The Guardian'' review, 15 August 2001]</ref>\n\nOn 31 August 1997, startled by the news of the [[death of Diana, Princess of Wales]], Am\u00e9lie drops a plastic perfume-stopper, which dislodges a wall tile and accidentally reveals an old metal box which contains childhood memorabilia hidden by a boy who lived in her apartment decades earlier. Am\u00e9lie resolves to track down the boy and return the box to him. She promises herself that if it makes him happy, she will devote her life to bringing happiness to others.\n\nAfter asking the apartment's concierge and several old tenants about the boy's identity, Am\u00e9lie meets her reclusive neighbour, Raymond Dufayel, an artist with [[Osteogenesis imperfecta|brittle bone disease]] who replicates [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir]]'s 1881 painting ''[[Luncheon of the Boating Party]]'' every year. He recalls the boy's name as \"Bretodeau\". Am\u00e9lie finds the man, Dominique Bretodeau, and surreptitiously gives him the box. Moved to tears by the discovery and the memories it holds, Bretodeau resolves to reconcile with his estranged daughter and the grandson he has never met. Am\u00e9lie happily embarks on her new mission.\n\nAm\u00e9lie secretly executes complex schemes that positively affect the lives of those around her. She escorts a blind man to the M\u00e9tro station while giving him a rich description of the street scenes he passes. She persuades her father to follow his dream of touring the world by stealing his [[garden gnome]] and having a flight attendant friend mail pictures of it [[Travelling gnome prank|posing with landmarks from all over the world]]. She starts a romance between her [[Hypochondriasis|hypochondriacal]] co-worker Georgette and Joseph, a patron of the cafe. She convinces Madeleine Wallace, the concierge of her block of flats, that the husband who abandoned her had sent her a final conciliatory love letter just before his accidental death years before. She plays [[practical joke]]s on Collignon, the nasty greengrocer. Mentally exhausted, Collignon no longer abuses his meek but good-natured assistant Lucien. A delighted Lucien takes charge at the grocery stand.\n\nMr. Dufayel, having observed Am\u00e9lie, begins a conversation with her about his painting. Although he has copied the same Renoir painting 20 times, he has never quite captured the look of the girl drinking a glass of water. They discuss the meaning of this character, and over several conversations, Am\u00e9lie begins projecting her loneliness onto the image. Dufayel recognizes this and uses the girl in the painting to push Am\u00e9lie to examine her attraction to a quirky young man, Nino Quincampoix, who collects the discarded photographs of strangers from passport photo booths. When Am\u00e9lie bumps into Nino a second time, she realizes she is falling in love with him. He accidentally drops a photo album in the street. Am\u00e9lie retrieves it.\n\nAm\u00e9lie plays a [[Cat and mouse|cat-and-mouse game]] with Nino around Paris before returning his treasured album anonymously. After arranging a meeting at the 2 Moulins, Am\u00e9lie panics and tries to deny her identity. Her co-worker, Gina, concerned for Am\u00e9lie's well-being, screens Nino for her; Joseph's comment about this misleads Am\u00e9lie to believe she has lost Nino to Gina. It takes Dufayel's insight to give her the courage to pursue Nino, resulting in a romantic night together and the beginning of a relationship. The film ends as Am\u00e9lie experiences a moment of happiness she has found for herself.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast list|\n* [[Audrey Tautou]] as Am\u00e9lie Poulain \n** Flora Guiet as young Am\u00e9lie\n* [[Mathieu Kassovitz]] as Nino Quincampoix\n** Amaury Babault as young Nino\n*[[Andr\u00e9 Dussollier]] as The Narrator\n* [[Rufus (actor)|Rufus]] as Rapha\u00ebl Poulain, Am\u00e9lie's father\n* [[Serge Merlin]] as Raymond Dufayel, \"The Glass Man\"\n* [[Lorella Cravotta]] as Amandine Poulain, Am\u00e9lie's mother\n* [[Clotilde Mollet]] as Gina, a fellow waitress\n* [[Claire Maurier]] as Suzanne, the owner of Caf\u00e9 des Deux Moulins\n* [[Isabelle Nanty]] as Georgette, the resident hypochondriac\n* [[Dominique Pinon]] as Joseph\n* [[Artus de Penguern]] as Hipolito, the writer\n* [[Yolande Moreau]] as Madeleine Wallace (Wells, in English subtitled version)\n* [[Urbain Cancelier]] as Collignon, the grocer\n* [[Jamel Debbouze]] as Lucien, the grocer's assistant\n* [[Maurice B\u00e9nichou]] as Dominique Bretodeau\n** Kevin Fernandes as young Dominique\n* [[Michel Robin]] as Mr. Collignon\n* [[Andr\u00e9e Damant]] as Mrs. Collignon\n* [[Claude Perron]] as Eva, Nino's colleague\n* [[Armelle]] as Philom\u00e8ne, air hostess\n* [[Ticky Holgado]] as Man in a photo\n* [[Fabienne Chaudat]] as The woman in a coma\n}}\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Au March\u00e9 de la Butte, Paris 12 April 2022.jpg|thumb|Au March\u00e9 de la Butte, Rue des Trois Fr\u00e8res, Paris, used as the location of Monsieur Collignon's shop]]\n\nIn his [[Audio commentary|DVD commentary]], Jeunet explains that he originally wrote the role of Am\u00e9lie for the English actress [[Emily Watson]]. In that first draft, Am\u00e9lie's father was an Englishman living in London. However, Watson's French was not strong, and when she became unavailable to shoot the film, owing to a conflict with the filming of ''[[Gosford Park]]'', Jeunet rewrote the screenplay for a French actress. [[Audrey Tautou]] was the first actress he auditioned having seen her on the poster for the 1999 film ''[[Venus Beauty Institute]]''.\n\nFilming took place from March 2 to July 7, 2000 mainly in Paris.
