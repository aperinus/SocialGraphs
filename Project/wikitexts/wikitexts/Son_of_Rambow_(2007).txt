Will is forbidden from watching films or television and is made to leave his classroom when the teacher puts on a documentary. In the corridor, he meets Lee Carter, the 12-year-old worst-behaved boy in school, thrown out of another class for bad behaviour. They accidentally break a fish bowl in the corridor; Lee volunteers to take the blame, pretending that the punishment is torture, in exchange for Will's watch, which belonged to his dead father. Moreover, Lee demands that Will performs the [[stunt]]s in a film Lee is making with [[home video]] equipment owned by his 16-year-old bullying older brother, Lawrence, which Lawrence uses in his video bootlegging enterprise. He intends to enter the ''[[Screen Test]]'' Young Film-Makers' Competition.\n\nWill accepts, after accidentally seeing the film ''[[First Blood]]'' at Lee's house while hiding from Lawrence. He becomes very enthusiastic, and plays several dangerous action scenes, culminating in the two boys becoming 'blood brothers' after Lee saves Will from drowning. Lee finds Will's sketch book, full of colourful and glorious ideas, and starts to incorporate some of them into his film script. The two become best friends, but Will has to keep it secret from his family and the increasingly interfering Brother Joshua of the Brethren, who clearly has designs on his mother.\n\nFrench exchange students arrive and one of them, Didier Revol, becomes very popular. After finding Will's sketch book, he asks Will if he and his acolytes can play in the film, and Will agrees. Didier reveals that he has always wanted to be an actor. This mushrooms into the whole school being part of the production, and Will being included with the cool sixth-formers. Lee does not like this, as he is no longer in control, and finally quits after a fight with Will during filming of the last sequence, which takes place at a disused power station. After Will becomes trapped when part of the unstable structure collapses due to Didier's carelessness, and the entire school/crew run away, even Didier, Lee returns to rescue his friend, but uses the excuse that he has come to collect his brother's camera. He too gets hurt, and has to go to hospital. Lawrence visits him, but is angry about the fact that the camera is broken.\n\nWill's mother, from whom he has struggled to hide his activities, finally realises that her son must be allowed to be himself and her family leaves the Brethren. The film is never submitted to the competition as they miss the deadline. The French students leave, and while Didier was popular and worshipped in Britain, his own school-mates mock him, and he is actually lonely and isolated. When Lawrence looks at Lee's footage he is impressed, and he sees Lee's rant at Will defending Lawrence's neglect and bullying, which was accidentally filmed. With Will's help, he adds a part in which he acts himself \u2013 including a reply message for his brother. When Lee leaves the hospital, he is brought to a cinema by surprise. His film is shown before the main feature (much to the enjoyment of the audience) and the two boys reunite.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Bill Milner]] as Will Proudfoot\n* [[Will Poulter]] as Lee Carter\n* [[Neil Dudgeon]] as Brother Joshua\n* [[Adam Godley]] as Brethren Leader\n* [[Jessica Hynes]] as Mary Proudfoot\n** Imogen Aboud as young Mary\n* [[Anna Wing]] as Grandma\n* Charlie Thrift as Duncan Miller\n* Zofia Brooks as Tina\n* Tallulah Evans as Jess Proudfoot\n* [[Jules Sitruk]] as Didier Revol\n* [[Ed Westwick]] as Lawrence Carter\n* [[Eric Sykes]] as Frank\n* [[Asa Butterfield]] as Brethren Boy\n* [[Adam Buxton]] as Chemistry teacher\n* [[Paul Ritter (actor)|Paul Ritter]] as Geography teacher\n* [[Edgar Wright]] as Metal school teacher\n* Chris Miles as Extra\n}}\n\n==Production==\n''Son of Rambow'' is a project that [[Garth Jennings]] and [[Nick Goldsmith]] \u2014 collectively known as [[Hammer & Tongs]] \u2014 worked on for some years. Its development was interrupted when they were asked to make ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (film)|The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]'', and it is their second major feature film. It was inspired by Jennings' own experiences as a child in the 1980s, when video equipment first became available to the public, and the film recreates the atmosphere of an English [[comprehensive school]] of the time, using a soundtrack of both familiar and lesser known pop tracks from the era.<ref>Garth Jennings, speaking after the London premiere</ref> The film was shot primarily in the English town of [[Berkhamsted]], and the nearby [[Ashridge Estate]] owned and managed by the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty]] [[Hertfordshire]]: featuring [[Ashlyns School]] and [[The Rex, Berkhamsted|The Rex]], a recently refurbished listed [[Art Deco]] cinema which had been left derelict between 1989 and 2004.\n\nThe two roads where both boys live are approximately 1,200 metres apart, being located next to [[Berkhamsted Castle]]. They are the two most exclusive residential roads in the town. The film also shot at the [[Richborough Power Station]] in Sandwich, which was then disused.<ref>{{cite web|author=Kent Film Office|url=http://kentfilmoffice.co.uk/2008/02/son-of-rambow-2007/|title=Kent Film Office Son of Rambow Film Focus}}</ref> The film includes a vintage clip of [[Jan Pinkava]] winning [[BBC|the BBC]] ''[[Screen Test]]'' competition.
