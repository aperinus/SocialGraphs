In direct contrast to the book, the film ends in a positive tone. It was the first film produced by [[TriStar Pictures]].\n\nThe film was nominated for four [[57th Academy Awards|Academy Awards]], including Best Supporting Actress (Close), and it was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress ([[Kim Basinger]]). Many of the baseball scenes were filmed in 1983 at [[War Memorial Stadium (Buffalo)|War Memorial Stadium]] in [[Buffalo, New York]], built in 1937 and demolished in 1988. [[All-High Stadium]], also in Buffalo, stood in for [[Chicago]]'s [[Wrigley Field]] in a key scene.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1910s [[Nebraska]], a young Roy Hobbs learns to play baseball from his father. After Hobbs Sr. suffers an early fatal [[heart attack]], lightning strikes the tree he died next to. Hobbs makes a [[baseball]] bat from the splintered wood, burning a lightning bolt and the name \u201cWonderboy\u201d into the barrel.\n\nNow 19 years old, Hobbs heads to Chicago for a tryout with the [[Chicago Cubs]], leaving behind his girlfriend, Iris. While on the train, he meets legendary ballplayer \"the Whammer\" (based on [[Babe Ruth]]), sportswriter Max Mercy, and Harriet Bird, a mysterious young woman following the Whammer. At a [[carnival]] during a stopover, Hobbs wins a bet that he can [[strike out]] the Whammer with just three pitches. Later Hobbs meets Bird in Chicago, and she asks if Hobbs's boast that he can be \"the best there ever was,\" is true. Hobbs answers yes, and Harriet shoots him in the abdomen and then commits [[suicide]]. \n\nSixteen years later, in 1939, Hobbs is signed as a rookie to the New York Knights, a struggling club in last place. Manager Pop Fisher is furious that Hobbs was signed without his approval, believing him too old, and suspects the owner's motives. He refuses to play Hobbs but later relents, electing him to [[pinch hit]], where he knocks the cover off the ball. Hobbs becomes a sensation and the Knights' fortunes turn around. Max Mercy finds Hobbs familiar but fails to recognize him.\n\nAssistant manager Red Blow tells Hobbs that if Pop loses the pennant this year, his Knights ownership share will revert to the Judge, the team's majority owner. The Judge offers Hobbs $5,000 ({{Inflation|US|5000|1939|2021|fmt=eq|r=-2}}) to throw the season. Hobbs, unlike Bump Bailey, refuses the bribe. While watching Hobbs pitch during a practice session, Mercy suddenly remembers him and introduces Hobbs to Gus Sands, a bookie who places large bets against Hobbs. He also meets Pop's beautiful niece, Memo Paris, who was Bump's girlfriend. Their budding romance causes a distracted Hobbs' game to slump.\n\nHobbs' slump continues until during a game, he sees a woman dressed in white and then hits a home run shattering the scoreboard clock. The woman is Iris, and they later meet at a diner.  She tells Hobbs she has a teenage son whose father lives in [[New York City]]. Their reunion restores Hobbs' hitting prowess, and the Knights surge into first place. However, at a team party, Hobbs collapses in pain and awakens in the hospital. A [[silver bullet]] removed from his stomach has caused long-term damage;  the doctor warns him it could prove fatal if Hobbs continues playing baseball without giving the wound time to heal.\n\nWith Hobbs hospitalized, the Knights lose three games in a row, setting up a [[one-game playoff]] against the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]]. The Judge comes to the hospital and offers Hobbs an even bigger bribe to throw the game, threatening to expose his involvement with Harriet Bird to the press. Memo visits Hobbs and urges him to accept the Judge's offer and to walk away. Later, Iris also visits and assures Hobbs he is a great ballplayer.\n\nStill recovering, Hobbs rejects the bribe and returns to the team.  Watching from the stands, Iris sends a note to Hobbs in the dugout, saying she has brought their son to the game.  In the ninth inning, the Knights are trailing. The Pirates bring in a young, hard-throwing pitcher, who, exploiting Hobbs' condition, throws inside, attempting to harm him. Hobbs hits a foul that splits his bat, Wonderboy, in two. Batboy Bobby Savoy brings him his own bat, the \"Savoy Special\", which Hobbs helped him make. Hobbs, down to his last strike, his wound bleeding through his jersey, smashes the ball into the stadium lights, [[Walk-off home run|winning the game]] and the [[National League pennant]]. The victory secures Pop's share of the team and the Knights advance to the [[World Series]].\n\nLater, back in Nebraska, Iris looks on as Hobbs plays catch with his son in the same field where he and his father once played.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Robert Redford]] as Roy Hobbs\n**Paul Sullivan Jr. as Young Roy Hobbs\n* [[Robert Duvall]] as Max Mercy\n* [[Glenn Close]] as Iris Gaines\n**Rachel Hall as Young Iris Gaines\n* [[Kim Basinger]] as Memo Paris\n* [[Wilford Brimley]] as \"Pop\" Fisher\n* [[Barbara Hershey]] as Harriet Bird\n* [[Robert Prosky]] as The Judge\n* [[Richard Farnsworth]] as \"Red\" Blow\n* [[Joe Don Baker]] as \"The Whammer\"\n* [[Darren McGavin]] as Gus Sands (uncredited)\n* [[Michael Madsen]] as Bartholomew \"Bump\" Bailey\n* [[John Finnegan (actor)|John Finnegan]] as Sam Simpson\n* [[Alan Fudge]] as Ed Hobbs\n* Ken Grassano as Al Fowler\n* [[Mike Starr (actor)|Mike Starr]] as Boone\n* Mickey Treanor as \"Doc\" Dizzy\n* Jon Van Ness as John Olsen\n* [[Tony Ferrara|Anthony J.
