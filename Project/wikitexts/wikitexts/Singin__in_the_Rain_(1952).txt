It offers a lighthearted depiction of [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] in the late 1920s, with the three stars portraying performers caught up in the transition from silent films to \"[[Sound film|talkies]]\".\n\nThe film was only a modest hit when it was first released. O'Connor won the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor \u2013 Motion Picture Musical or Comedy]], and [[Betty Comden]] and [[Adolph Green]] won the [[Writers Guild of America Award]] for their screenplay, while [[Jean Hagen]] was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress]]. However, it has since been accorded legendary status by contemporary critics, and is often regarded as the [[List of films considered the best#Musical|greatest musical film ever made]] and one of the greatest films ever made,<ref>Haley Jr., Jack: ''[[That's Entertainment!]]'', Frank Sinatra segments. [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]], 1974</ref> as well as the greatest film made in the \"[[Arthur Freed|Freed Unit]]\" at [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]. It topped the [[AFI's Greatest Movie Musicals]] list and is ranked as the fifth-greatest American motion picture of all time in its updated [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Movies (10th Anniversary Edition)|list of the greatest American films]] in 2007.\n\nIn 1989, ''Singin' in the Rain'' was one of the first 25 films selected by the United States [[Library of Congress]] for preservation in the [[National Film Registry]] for being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".<ref>{{cite news |date=September 19, 1989 |title=ENTERTAINMENT: Film Registry Picks First 25 Movies |url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1989-09-19-mn-347-story.html |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |access-date=April 22, 2020}}</ref> In 2005, the [[British Film Institute]] included it in its list of the 50 films to be seen by the age of 14.

Don barely tolerates his spoiled and conniving costar Lina Lamont, though their studio, Monumental Pictures, links them romantically to increase their popularity. Lina is convinced that they truly are in love, despite Don's protestations otherwise.\n\nAt the premiere of their latest film, ''The Royal Rascal'', Don tells the gathered crowd a version of his life story, including his motto: \"Dignity, always dignity.\" His words are humorously contradicted by [[Flashback (narrative)|flashbacks]] showing him alongside his best friend Cosmo Brown (\"Fit as a Fiddle\"). To escape from his fans after the premiere, Don jumps into a passing car driven by Kathy Selden. She drops him off, but not before claiming to be a stage actress and sneering at his \"undignified\" accomplishments as a movie star.\n\nLater, at an after-party, the head of Don's studio, R.F. Simpson, shows a short demonstration of a [[Sound film|talking picture]],{{efn|This scene pays homage to the original 1921 DeForest [[Phonofilm]] demonstration, featuring DeForest explaining the system.}} but his guests are unimpressed. To Don's amusement, Kathy pops out of a mock cake right in front of him, revealing herself to be a chorus girl (\"All I Do is Dream of You\"). Furious at Don's teasing, she throws a cake at him, accidentally hitting Lina in the face, and then flees. Don becomes smitten with Kathy and searches for her for weeks, with Cosmo trying to cheer him up (\"[[Make 'Em Laugh]]\"). While filming a romantic scene, a jealous Lina reveals that her influence is behind Kathy's loss of work and subsequent disappearance. On the studio lot, Cosmo finally finds Kathy quietly working in another Monumental Pictures production (\"Beautiful Girl\"). Don sings her a love song, and she confesses to having been a fan of his all along (\"You Were Meant for Me\").\n\nAfter rival studio [[Warner Bros.]] has an enormous hit with its first talking picture, the 1927 film ''[[The Jazz Singer]]'', R.F. decides he has no choice but to convert the next Lockwood and Lamont film, ''The Dueling Cavalier'', into a talkie. The production is beset with difficulties, including Lina's grating voice and strong [[Brooklyn accent]]. An exasperated diction coach tries to teach her how to speak properly, but to no avail. In contrast, Don fares better when taking diction lessons (\"Moses Supposes\"). ''The Dueling Cavalier''{{'}}s preview screening is a disaster; the actors are barely audible thanks to the awkward placing of the microphones, Don repeats the line \"I love you\" to Lina over and over, to the audience's derisive laughter,{{efn|This is a reference to a scene by [[John Gilbert (actor)|John Gilbert]] in his first talkie, ''[[His Glorious Night]]''.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}}} and in the middle of the film, the sound goes out of synchronization, with hilarious results as Lina shakes her head while the villain's deep voice says, \"Yes! Yes! Yes!\" and the villain nods his head while Lina's squeaky soprano says, \"No! No! No!\"\n\nAfterward (\"[[Good Morning (1939 song)|Good Morning]]\"), Kathy and Cosmo help Don come up with the idea to turn ''The Dueling Cavalier'' into a musical called ''The Dancing Cavalier,'' complete with a modern musical number and backstory. The three are disheartened when they realize Lina's terrible voice remains a problem. Still, Cosmo, inspired by the scene in ''The Dueling Cavalier'' where Lina's voice was out of sync, suggests that they [[Dubbing (filmmaking)|dub]] Lina's voice with Kathy's (\"[[Singin' in the Rain (song)|Singin' in the Rain]]\"). After hearing Don and Cosmo pitch the idea (\"Broadway Melody\"), R.F. approves but tells them not to inform Lina that Kathy is doing the dubbing (\"Would You\").  Having learned the truth, an infuriated Lina barges in on a dubbing session, and becomes even angrier when she is told that Don and Kathy are in love and intend to marry, and that R.F. intends to give Kathy a screen credit and a big publicity buildup. Lina threatens to sue R.F. unless he makes sure no one ever hears of Kathy and that she keeps dubbing for the rest of her career. R.F. reluctantly agrees because of a clause in Lina's contract which holds the studio responsible for positive media coverage.\n\nThe premiere of ''The Dancing Cavalier'' is a tremendous success. When the audience clamors for Lina to sing live, Don, Cosmo, and R.F. tell her to [[lip sync]] into a microphone while Kathy, concealed behind the curtain, sings into a second one. While Lina is \"singing\" (\"Singin' in the Rain Reprise\"), Don Cosmo, and R.F. gleefully open the curtain, revealing the fakery. The defeated Lina flees in humiliation, and a distressed Kathy tries to run away as well, but Don proudly announces to the audience that she's \"the real star\" of the film (\"You Are My Lucky Star\"). Later, Kathy and Don kiss in front of a billboard for their new film, ''Singin' in the Rain''.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Gene Kelly]] as Donald (Don) Lockwood\n* [[Donald O'Connor]] as Cosmo Brown\n* [[Debbie Reynolds]] as Kathy Selden.

Comden and Green first refused the assignment, as their agent had assured them that their new contract with MGM called for them to write the lyrics to all songs unless the score was by [[Irving Berlin]], [[Cole Porter]], or [[Rodgers and Hammerstein]]. After a two-week hold-out, their new agent, [[Irving Lazar|Irving \"Swifty\" Lazar]], having looked over the contract, told them that the clause had been entirely an invention of their previous agent, and that there was no such language in the contract. After hearing this, Comden and Green began working on the story and script.<ref>Comden & Green (1972), pp.1-4</ref>\n\nBecause many of the songs had originally been written during the time when silent films were giving way to \"talkies\" and musicals were popular with audiences, Comden and Green came up with the idea that the story should be set during that transitional period in Hollywood, an era they were intimately familiar with. When [[Howard Keel]] was mentioned as the possible lead, they tried to work up a story involving a star of Western films who makes a comeback as a singing cowboy, but they kept gravitating to a story about a swashbuckling romantic hero with a vaudeville background who survives the transition by falling back on his abilities as a song-and-dance man, a story which Gene Kelly was well-suited for.<ref>Comden & Green (1972), pp.4-5</ref>\n\nKelly could not be approached at the time, as he was deeply immersed in ''[[An American in Paris (film)|An American in Paris]]'' (1951), which he was co-choreographing with Stanley Donen, and in which he was starring. Comden and Green continued to work on the script, and had at that time three possible openings for the film: a silent movie premiere, a magazine interview with a Hollywood star, and a star-meets-girl, star-loses-girl sequence. Unable to decide which to use or how to proceed, they had just decided to return their advance to MGM and admit defeat, when Betty Comden's husband arrived from New York and suggested that they combine all three openings into one. The script with the re-written opening was approved by Freed and by MGM's head of production [[Dore Schary]], who had recently replaced [[Louis B. Mayer]].<ref>Comden & Green (1972), pp.5-8</ref>\n\nBy this time shooting on ''An American in Paris'' had completed, and Freed suggested that Kelly be given the script to read. Kelly and Donen responded enthusiastically, and immediately become involved in re-writes and adjustments to the script. Comden, Green, Kelly, and Donen were all old friends, and the process went smoothly. Besides the Freed-Brown songs, Comden and Green contributed the lyrics to \"Moses Supposes\", which was set to music by [[Roger Edens]]. Shortly before shooting began, \"The Wedding of the Painted Doll\", which Comden and Green had \"painfully wedged into the script as a cheering-up song\" was replaced with a new Freed/Brown song, \"Make 'Em Laugh\",<ref>{{cite web|url=https://digitalcollections.oscars.org/digital/collection/p15759coll30/id/13746|website=Margaret Herrick Library Digital Collections|title=SINGIN' IN THE RAIN, 1952|accessdate=June 26, 2021}}</ref> which bore a remarkable resemblance to [[Cole Porter]]'s 1948 song \"[[Be a Clown]]\".\n\nAfter Comden and Green had returned to New York to work on other projects, they received word that a new song was needed for a love-song sequence between Kelly and Debbie Reynolds. The original had been a song-and-dance medley involving different sets in different soundstages on the studio lot, but they were asked for a romantic love song set in an empty sound stage, and it was needed immediately. Comden and Green provided such a scene for \"You Are My Lucky Star\" and sent it off to Hollywood.<ref>Comden & Green (1972), pp.9-10</ref>\n\n===Revisions from early drafts===\n[[File:Singin' in the Rain trailer (1952).webm|thumb|thumbtime=29|upright=1.5|Trailer]]\n* In an early draft of the script, the musical number \"Singin' in the Rain\" was to be sung by Reynolds, O'Connor, and Kelly, emerging from a restaurant after the flop preview of ''The Dueling Cavalier'', to celebrate the idea of changing the film into a musical.<ref name=\"Hess\">Hess & Dabholkar (2009), p.124</ref>\n* Kelly singing \"You Were Meant For Me\" to Reynolds on an empty sound stage was not included in that draft. The number was originally conceived as Kelly singing a medley of other songs to her as they romped around various studio back lot sets.<ref name=Hess23-24>Hess & Dabholkarm (2009), pp.23-24</ref>\n* Rita Moreno was originally to have sung the lead in \"I've Got a Feelin' You're Foolin'\" with other showgirls, but this ended up as part of the \"Beautiful Girl Montage\" without her.<ref name=Hess70>Hess & Dabholkar (2009), p.70</ref>\n\n=== Scenes filmed but cut before release ===\n* Gene Kelly sang a reprise of \"All I Do Is Dream of You\" after the party at R.F. Simpson's house when Kelly chases after Reynolds. The song, ending in Kelly's bedroom, was cut from the release version after two [[test screening|previews]], and the footage has been lost.<ref name=Hess173>Hess & Dabholkarm (2009), p.173</ref>\n* Reynolds' solo rendition of \"You Are My Lucky Star\" (to a billboard showing an image of Lockwood) was cut after previews.<ref name=Hess173 /> This number has survived and is included on the original soundtrack and DVD version of the film.<ref name=\"glorious\" /> It also was used in the retrospective film [[That's Entertainment! III|That's Entertainment III]].\n* In the steamy \"Vamp Dance\" segment of the \"Broadway Melody Ballet\" with Cyd Charisse and Gene Kelly, reviewers from both the [[Motion Picture Production Code|Production Code]] and the Catholic [[National Legion of Decency|Legion of Decency]] objected to a brief, suggestive pose or movement between the dancers. Although there is no precise documentation of what or where it was, close examination of footage toward the end of the dance shows an abrupt cut when Charisse is wrapped around Kelly, indicating the probable location.<ref>Hess & Dabholkarm (2009), pp.180-181</ref>\n\n=== Other notes ===\nReynolds' singing in two songs was dubbed by [[Betty Noyes]], one of them when Kathy is shown dubbing Lina Lamont, while her high notes and taps were dubbed in the entire film. The spoken dialog in the same scene was actually uttered by Hagen. Donen once explained Reynolds' \"mid-western\" accent was thought inferior to Hagen's natural speaking voice for this one scene.<ref>{{cite book|last=North|first=Michael|url=https://www.google.co.uk/books/edition/The_Dialect_of_Modernism/gOpcCAAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1&dq=%22Singin%27+in+the+Rain%22+Reynolds+dubbed&pg=PT12&printsec=frontcover|title=The Dialect of Modernism|location=New York City|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1997|page=12|isbn=978-0-19-028411-4}}</ref>\n\nIn the sequence in which Gene Kelly dances and sings the title song while spinning an umbrella, splashing through puddles and getting soaked with rain, Kelly was sick with a {{convert|103|\u00b0F}} fever.<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Sanburn |first=Josh |date=December 2, 2010 |title=Top Ten Movie Dance Scenes: A Wet, Soft Shoe in ''Singin' in the Rain |url=http://entertainment.time.com/2010/12/03/top-10-movie-dance-scenes/ |magazine=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=The Biography Channel |url=http://www.thebiographychannel.co.uk/biography_story/255:304/1/Eugene_Gene_Kelly.htm |access-date=2008-06-03 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402202717/http://www.thebiographychannel.co.uk/biographies/eugene-gene-kelly.html |archive-date=2015-04-02}}</ref> The water used in the scene caused Kelly's wool suit to shrink during filming.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Sheridan |first1=Peter |title=The dark side of Singin' In The Rain star Gene Kelly |url=https://www.express.co.uk/life-style/life/799001/Gene-Kelly-Singing-In-The-Rain-An-American-In-Paris-biography |website=express.co.uk |date=May 2, 2017 |access-date=31 May 2020}}</ref> A common myth is that Kelly managed to perform the entire song in one take, thanks to cameras placed at predetermined locations.
