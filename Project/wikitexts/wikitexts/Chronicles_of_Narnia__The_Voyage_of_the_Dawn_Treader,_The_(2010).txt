S. Lewis]]'s fantasy series ''[[The Chronicles of Narnia]]'' (and fifth in internal chronological order). It is the third and final installment in [[The Chronicles of Narnia (film series)|the original ''Chronicles of Narnia'' film series]], and the only film in the series to be released in [[Digital 3D]]. It is also the only film in the series not to be distributed by [[Walt Disney Pictures]], which was replaced by [[20th Century Fox]]. However, Disney would eventually own the rights to all the films in the series following the [[acquisition of 21st Century Fox by Disney]] in 2019.\n\nThe film is set three Narnian years after the events of ''[[The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian|Prince Caspian]]''. The two youngest Pevensie siblings, [[Edmund Pevensie|Edmund]] ([[Skandar Keynes]]) and [[Lucy Pevensie|Lucy]] ([[Georgie Henley]]), are transported back to Narnia along with their cousin [[Eustace Scrubb]] ([[Will Poulter]]). They join the new king of Narnia, [[Caspian X|Caspian]] ([[Ben Barnes (actor)|Ben Barnes]]), in his quest to rescue seven lost lords and to save Narnia from a corrupting evil that resides on a dark island. Each character is tested as they journey to the home of the great lion [[Aslan]] ([[Liam Neeson]]) at the far end of the world.\n\nDevelopment on ''The Voyage of the Dawn Treader'' began in 2007, while ''Prince Caspian'' was still in production. Filming was supposed to take place in [[Malta]], [[Czech Republic]] and [[Iceland]] in 2008 with [[Michael Apted]] as its new director, for a planned release in 2009. But production was halted after a budgetary dispute between Walden Media and [[Walt Disney Pictures]] concerning ''Prince Caspian''{{'s}} performance at the [[box office]], resulting in Disney's departing the production and being replaced by [[20th Century Fox]] under the [[Fox 2000 Pictures]] label. Filming later took place in [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]] in 2009 and was converted into 3-D in 2010. It was released in traditional [[Two-dimensional space|2D]], [[RealD 3D]], and [[Digital 3D]]. The screenplay, which was based on the novel with same name by C. S. Lewis, was written by Stephen McFeely and Christopher Markus.\n\nThe film premiered on November 30, 2010, at a [[Royal Film Performance]] in London<ref name=\"BBCNews.co.uk\">{{cite news | title = Voyage of the Dawn Treader film chosen for royal gala | work = BBC News| date = 2010-08-16 | url =http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-10987423 | access-date=2010-08-18}}</ref> and was released worldwide on December 10, 2010. The film was met with mixed reviews, praising the performances and visual effects but criticizing the script and pace. It received moderate success in North America with a gross of $104 million, which was lower than its predecessors; however, it fared better than ''Prince Caspian'' internationally with $310 million. The film was the 12th-highest-grossing film of 2010 worldwide with nearly $415 million and received a nomination at the [[68th Golden Globe Awards]]. It then became 20th Century Fox's [[2010 in film|highest-grossing film in 2010]].<ref name=\"2010 Yearly Box Office Results\">[https://www.boxofficemojo.com/yearly/chart/?view2=worldwide&yr=2010&p=.htm 2010 Yearly Box Office Results].

Edmund is too young to enlist in [[His Majesty's Armed Forces]], to his chagrin. A painting of a ship on the ocean transports Lucy, Edmund, and Eustace into an ocean in [[Narnia (world)|Narnia]].\n\nThey are rescued by the ''[[Dawn Treader]]''. [[Caspian X|Caspian]] invites them on a voyage to rescue the seven Lords of Narnia whom his uncle [[Miraz]] banished. In the Lone Islands, where people are sold as slaves, Caspian and Edmund are imprisoned while Lucy and Eustace are sold as slaves. Caspian meets one of the lost lords, who reveals that unsold slaves are sacrificed to a green mist. The crew of the ''Dawn Treader'' rescues Caspian and the others. The lord, who becomes the new governor, gives Caspian a sword, one of seven given to the lords by Aslan.\n\nAt another island, Lucy is abducted by invisible [[Dufflepuds]] who force her to enter the manor of the magician [[Coriakin]] to find a visibility spell. Coriakin encourages the crew to defeat the mist by laying the lords' swords at Aslan's Table on Ramandu's island, but warns they will be tested. Lucy recites a beauty incantation she found, and enters a dream in which she is Susan, and neither Lucy nor Narnia exist. Aslan chides Lucy for her self-doubt, explaining that her siblings only know of Narnia because of her.\n\nAt a third island, another sword is recovered from a pool that turns anything that touches it into gold. Eustace steals from a rock pit full of treasure. While Edmund and Caspian look for Eustace, they discover the remains of another of the lords, recovering his sword. A dragon approaches and is driven away from the ''Dawn Treader''. The dragon is Eustace, transformed by the treasure. [[Reepicheep]] befriends Eustace, who has a change of heart and becomes useful to the crew.\n\nThe crew arrives at Aslan's Table to find three lost lords sleeping. As they place the swords on the table they realize one is missing. A star descends from the sky and transforms into [[Ramandu's Daughter|Lilliandil]], a beautiful woman who guides them to the Dark Island, a lair of the mist, where they discover the last lord. The island uses Edmund's fear to create a [[sea serpent]] that attacks the ship. Eustace fights the serpent, but the panicked lord wounds him with the last sword, causing him to fly away. He encounters Aslan, who transforms him back into a boy and sends him to Ramandu's island with the last sword. As the crew fights the serpent, the mist distracts Edmund by appearing as Jadis, the [[White Witch]]. Eustace reaches the table, but the mist tries to stop him from putting the sword on the table with the others. He overcomes the mist, allowing the swords to unleash their magic and bestow Edmund's own sword with the power to slay the sea serpent, the death of which awakens the three lords, destroys the mist and Dark Island, and liberates the sacrificed slaves.\n\nEustace rejoins Lucy, Edmund, Caspian, and Reepicheep, and they sail to a mysterious shore before a massive wave. Aslan appears, telling them that [[Aslan's Country|his country]] lies beyond, although if they go there they may never return. Caspian wishes to enter Aslan's country but changes his mind, knowing he has more duties as a king, but Reepicheep is determined to enter. Aslan blesses him and he bids farewell to Caspian, Edmund, Lucy and Eustace. Aslan tells Lucy and Edmund that they cannot return to Narnia as they have grown up. Aslan encourages them to know him in their world by another name. Aslan opens a portal to return them to their world. As Lucy, Edmund and Eustace walk to the portal, Eustace asks Aslan whether he will be able to return. Aslan replies that he can. The three of them are returned to the bedroom. Eustace hears his mother announcing a visitor, [[Jill Pole]]. Eustace hangs the painting back on the wall. As they exit the bedroom, they look back at the painting and see the ship voyaging through the waves disappear before Lucy closes the door.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{See also|List of The Chronicles of Narnia (film series) cast members}}\n\n=== Pevensies and Scrubbs ===\n* [[Skandar Keynes]] as [[Edmund Pevensie]]: The third-oldest of the Pevensie children and a King of Narnia.

At first, he irritates everyone with his bad attitude, but he dramatically changes after he is cursed and becomes a dragon.

She aides the crew in destroying the evil of Dark Island and is also Caspian's love interest.
