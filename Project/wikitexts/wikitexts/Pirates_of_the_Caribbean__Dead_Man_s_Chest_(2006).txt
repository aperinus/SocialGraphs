It is the second installment of the [[Pirates of the Caribbean (film series)|''Pirates of the Caribbean'' film series]] and the sequel to ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl]]'' (2003). It was directed by [[Gore Verbinski]], written by [[Ted Elliott (screenwriter)|Ted Elliott]] and [[Terry Rossio]], and produced by [[Jerry Bruckheimer]]. In the film, the wedding of [[Will Turner]] ([[Orlando Bloom]]) and [[Elizabeth Swann]] ([[Keira Knightley]]) is interrupted by [[List of Pirates of the Caribbean characters#Cutler Beckett|Lord Cutler Beckett]] ([[Tom Hollander]]), who wants Turner to acquire the compass of [[Jack Sparrow|Captain Jack Sparrow]] ([[Johnny Depp]]) in a bid to find the [[Dead Man's Chest]]. Sparrow discovers his debt to [[Davy Jones (Pirates of the Caribbean)|Davy Jones]] ([[Bill Nighy]]) is due.\n\nTwo sequels to ''Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl'' were conceived in 2004, with Elliott and Rossio developing a [[story arc]] that would span both films. Filming took place from February to September 2005 in [[Palos Verdes]], [[Saint Vincent and the Grenadines]], [[Dominica]], and [[The Bahamas]], as well as on sets constructed at [[Walt Disney Studios (Burbank)|Walt Disney Studios]]. It was shot back-to-back with the third film of the series, ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End|At World's End]]'' (2007).\n\n''Dead Man's Chest'' was released in the United States on July 7, 2006, and received mixed reviews, with praise for its special effects, direction, action sequences, [[Hans Zimmer]]'s musical score, humor, and performances, particularly those of Depp and Nighy, but criticism for its running time and plot. The film broke several records at the time, including the opening-weekend record in the United States with $136 million, the fastest film to gross over $1 billion at the worldwide box office (63 days), became the [[2006 in film#Highest-grossing films|highest-grossing film of 2006]], and was the highest-grossing film produced by [[Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures|Disney]] until it was surpassed by ''[[Toy Story 3]]'' in 2010. The film received four nominations at the [[79th Academy Awards]] (winning [[Academy Award for Best Visual Effects|Best Visual Effects]]).\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Plot summaries should be set between 400-700 words. Please see WP:FILMPLOT for more information before adding material. -->\nThe wedding of [[Will Turner]] and [[Elizabeth Swann]] is interrupted when Lord [[Cutler Beckett]], chairman of the [[East India Trading Company]], arrives with [[arrest warrant]]s for them, and also for [[Commodore (Royal Navy)|Commodore]] [[James Norrington]], who allowed [[Jack Sparrow|Captain Jack Sparrow]] to escape. Norrington has resigned and disappeared after losing the Navy's [[flagship]], HMS ''Dauntless'', in a [[hurricane]] while pursuing Jack. Meanwhile, Jack is visited by Will's father, [[Bootstrap Bill Turner]], aboard the ''[[Black Pearl]]''. Bootstrap is a crewman on the ''[[Flying Dutchman]]'', captained by [[Davy Jones (Pirates of the Caribbean)|Davy Jones]]. Jack previously bartered a deal with Jones to raise the ''Pearl'' from the depths, and must now join the ''Dutchman'''s crew or be dragged to [[List of locations in Pirates of the Caribbean#Davy Jones' Locker|Davy Jones' Locker]] by the [[Kraken (Pirates of the Caribbean)|Kraken]]. Meanwhile, Beckett has a meeting with Will, where he reveals that he has three potential full pardons and [[Letters of Marque]] (for Jack Sparrow) signed by the king. Beckett offers to validate the pardons for Will and Elizabeth's favor if Will goes on a journey on behalf of the EITC to recover Jack's compass for Beckett's use.\n\nWill finds Jack and the crew on an island and frees them from [[human cannibalism|cannibals]]. After escaping the cannibals, Jack and the crew visit [[wikt:voodoo|voodoo]] priestess [[Tia Dalma]], who reveals Jones' weakness is his heart, locked within the Dead Man's Chest; Jack intends to find it and free himself from Jones' service. Locating the ''Dutchman'', Will makes a deal with Jack to find the key to the chest in return for Jack's compass, but is tricked into joining Jones' crew in Jack's stead. Jones agrees to release Jack from their bargain in exchange for ninety-nine more souls. Will meets his father aboard the ''Dutchman'' and learns that Jones possesses the key to the chest. Despite losing a game of [[Liar's Dice]] to Jones, Will escapes with the key and is taken aboard the same ship Elizabeth was on. Jones sends the Kraken after him and sinks the ship, but Will again escapes.\n\nMeanwhile, Elizabeth's father [[List of Pirates of the Caribbean characters#Weatherby Swann|Governor Swann]] frees her from jail but is captured himself. Elizabeth bargains with Beckett to find the compass herself and makes her way to [[List of locations in Pirates of the Caribbean#Tortuga|Tortuga]], where she finds both Jack and a drunken Norrington. Jack hires a new crew, including Elizabeth and Norrington, and Elizabeth uses the compass to find the chest. All parties arrive on [[List of locations in Pirates of the Caribbean#Isla Cruces|Isla Cruces]], where the chest is buried, but a three-way [[sword fight]] breaks out between Jack, Will, and Norrington, who all want the heart for their respective goals: Jack wants to call off the Kraken and negate his debt to Jones; Will wants to release his father from the ''Dutchman''; and Norrington wants to regain his life as a Navy officer. In the chaos, Norrington secretly steals the heart and runs off, pretending to lure away the ''Dutchman''{{'}}s crew. Jones attacks the ''Pearl'' with the Kraken, which kills most of the crew and destroys all but one of the ''Pearl''{{'}}s lifeboats, but Jack, who briefly fled the battle, returns and wounds the Kraken with a net full of gunpowder and [[rum]].\n\nJack orders the survivors to abandon ship, but Elizabeth, realizing the Kraken only wants Jack, tricks him by kissing him and chains him to the mast so that the crew can escape. The Kraken drags Jack and the ''Pearl'' to Davy Jones' Locker, and Jones declares their debt is settled, but then opens the chest and discovers, to his rage, that his heart is gone. In [[Port Royal]], Norrington gives Beckett the heart and the [[Letters of Marque]] meant for Jack, allowing him back into the navy, as well as allowing Beckett to gain control of Davy Jones and the seas. The ''Pearl''{{'}}s crew takes shelter with Tia Dalma, where they all agree to rescue Jack. Tia Dalma introduces the captain who will guide them: the resurrected [[Hector Barbossa]].\n\n==Cast==\n{{main|List of Pirates of the Caribbean cast members|l1=List of ''Pirates of the Caribbean'' cast members|List of Pirates of the Caribbean characters|l2=characters}}\n* [[Johnny Depp]] as [[Jack Sparrow|Captain Jack Sparrow]]: The eccentric pirate captain of the ''Black Pearl''.

By November, the script was still unfinished as the writers did not want director [[Gore Verbinski]] and producer [[Jerry Bruckheimer]] to compromise what they had written, so Verbinski worked with [[James Byrkit]] to storyboard major sequences without need of a script, while Elliott and Rossio wrote a \"preparatory\" script for the crew to use before they finished the script they were happy with. By January 2005, with rising costs and no script, Disney executives threatened to cancel the film, but changed their minds.

Similarly, the ''Pirates'' crew wanted to cut the idea for budget reasons, in addition to feel that it would be unbelievable, or as the film's historian dismissed, suicidal.

Nighy wore make-up around his eyes and mouth to splice into the computer-generated shots, but the images of his eyes and mouth were not used. Nighy only wore a prosthetic once, with blue-colored tentacles for when [[Will Turner]] ([[Orlando Bloom]]) steals the key to the Dead Man's Chest from under his \"beard\" as he sleeps. To create the CGI version of the character, the model was closely based on a full-body scan of Nighy, with Jones reflecting his high cheekbones. Animators studied every frame of Nighy's performance: the actor himself had blessed them by making his performance more quirky than expected, providing endless fun for them. His performance also meant new controls had to be stored.
