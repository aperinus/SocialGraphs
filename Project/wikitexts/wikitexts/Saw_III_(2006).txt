It is the third installment in the [[Saw (franchise)|''Saw'' film series]]. The film stars [[Tobin Bell]], [[Shawnee Smith]], [[Angus Macfadyen]], [[Bahar Soomekh]], and [[Dina Meyer]]. The plot follows Jeff Denlon, a man whose son was killed by a drunk driver, who is put through a series of tests by [[Jigsaw (Saw character)|Jigsaw]] meant to help him overcome his anger towards the killer driver. Meanwhile, John Kramer, now bed-ridden due to progression of his cancer, has his apprentice, [[Amanda Young]], kidnap Dr. Lynn Denlon (Jeff's wife), who is tasked with keeping John alive for one final test before his death.\n\nMuch like its predecessor, ''[[Saw II]]'', the film was immediately green-lit after the successful opening weekend of the prior film. Filming took place in [[Toronto]] from May to June 2006. Whannell aimed to make the story more emotional than previous installments, particularly with the Amanda and Jigsaw storyline. The film is dedicated to producer [[Gregg Hoffman]], who died on December 4, 2005.\n\n''Saw III'' was released in the United States on {{nowrap|October 27, 2006}}, by [[Lionsgate Films|Lionsgate]]. It was a financial success, opening to $33.6 million and grossing $80.2 million in the United States and Canada. It is the highest-grossing film of the series in the international market with $84.6 million and the highest-grossing film in the series overall with $164.9 million worldwide. It received mixed to negative reviews from critics. Bell was nominated for \"Best Villain\" at the [[2007 MTV Movie Awards]] and the film received nominations for a [[Saturn Award]] as \"Best Horror Film\". The film was released to [[DVD]] and [[Blu-ray]] on {{nowrap|January 23, 2007}}, and topped the charts selling 2.5 million units in its first week. A sequel, titled ''[[Saw IV]]'', was released in 2007.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, the plot summary should be 400-700 words. -->\nAfter being left in the bathroom to die, Detective [[Eric Matthews (Saw)|Eric Matthews]] breaks his foot with a toilet lid to escape his shackle. Six months later, the aftermath of a [[Jigsaw (Saw character)|Jigsaw]] game is discovered by Officer [[List of Saw characters#Daniel Rigg|Daniel Rigg]]'s [[SWAT]] team. The victim, [[List of Saw characters#Troy|Troy]], had to rip chains from his body to escape a bomb. Detective [[List of Saw characters#Allison Kerry|Allison Kerry]] points out that the room's exit was welded shut, breaking Jigsaw's [[modus operandi]] of giving his victims a chance to survive. While reviewing the videotape, Kerry is abducted and awakens in a harness hooked into her ribs. She retrieves the key from a beaker of acid as instructed, but the lock does not open and the trap inevitably kills her.\n\n[[List of Saw characters#Lynn Denlon|Dr. Lynn Denlon]] is abducted from the hospital she works at and brought to the bedridden John Kramer. His apprentice, [[Amanda Young]], locks a collar armed with five shotgun shells around Lynn's neck that is connected to John's heart rate monitor and will detonate if she moves out of range or John dies. Lynn is instructed by Amanda to keep him alive until another test subject has completed his game; the victim [[List of Saw characters#Jeff Denlon|Jeff]], a grief-stricken father consumed with vengeance after the death of his son [[List of Saw characters#Dylan Denlon|Dylan]] in a drunk driving accident, must undergo a series of tests around the abandoned [[meatpacking plant]] to confront those involved in the case.\n\nJeff's first test leads him into a meat freezer where he finds [[List of Saw characters#Danica Scott|Danica Scott]], the only witness to the accident, who refused to testify in court; naked and chained to a metal frame inside the plant's freezer, with nozzles inside the frame to spray her with water to quicken her hypothermia. Jeff retrieves the key after Danica persuades him to help her, but she freezes to death before he can do so. In his next test, [[List of Saw characters#Judge Halden|Judge Halden]], who passed a lenient sentence on the driver who caused Dylan's death, is chained at the neck to the bottom of a vat. Rotting pig carcasses are dropped into a grinder that slowly fill the pit until Jeff saves him by burning Dylan's memorabilia in an incinerator to retrieve a key. His third test involves [[List of Saw characters#Timothy Young|Timothy Young]], the driver who killed Dylan, who is strapped to a machine that will slowly twist his limbs and head. The key is tied to the trigger of an enclosed shotgun that goes off after Jeff retrieves it, accidentally killing Halden. Jeff fails to save Timothy in time and the machine snaps his neck.\n\nLynn is forced to perform an improvised surgery to relieve pressure on John's brain. The surgery is successful and Lynn convinces John to order Amanda to remove the collar. However, Amanda refuses and threatens Lynn's life, having become jealous of her interactions with John. John pleads with Amanda, who admits that she no longer believes in his philosophy and had been manipulating her traps to Troy and Kerry. Refusing to listen to John's warnings, Amanda shoots Lynn just as Jeff arrives. Jeff, who is revealed to be Lynn's husband, retaliates by shooting Amanda with a gun provided by John after his tests. As Amanda dies, John reveals that Lynn's test was actually hers: John was aware of her motives and unwilling to allow a murderer to continue his legacy. He then addresses Jeff, offering to call an ambulance for Lynn if he has learned everything from his ordeal, and accept one last test: either killing John or forgiving him. In response, Jeff slashes John's throat with a power saw, activating Lynn's collar as the room is sealed shut. Before dying, John takes out a tape recorder to inform Jeff that his daughter, [[List of Saw characters#Corbett Denlon|Corbett]] was also captured and he must face another test to save her.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Further|topic=the cast and characters|List of Saw (franchise) cast members|List of Saw characters|label1=List of Saw cast members}}\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Tobin Bell]] as [[Jigsaw (Saw character)|John Kramer / Jigsaw]]\n* [[Shawnee Smith]] as [[Amanda Young]]\n* [[Angus Macfadyen]] as Jeff Denlon\n* [[Bahar Soomekh]] as Lynn Denlon\n* [[Donnie Wahlberg]] as [[Eric Matthews (Saw)|Detective Eric Matthews]]\n* [[Dina Meyer]] as Detective Allison Kerry\n* [[Leigh Whannell]] as Adam Stanheight\n* [[Mpho Koaho]] as Timothy Young\n* Barry Flatman as Judge Halden\n* [[Lyriq Bent]] as Officer Daniel Rigg\n* Kelly Jones as SWAT Member Pete\n* Vincent Rother as SWAT Member Joe\n* [[J.

Gordon eventually returned to the series in ''[[Saw 3D]]'' (2010), but with a whole different storyline.<ref name=\"Saw3DDVDCommentary\">''[[Saw 3D]]'' DVD commentary</ref>\n\nBousman said they did not intend to have a [[twist ending]], as distinctly as the previous films, noting that \"I think most people will figure it out in the first 15 minutes of the film\". Whannell added, \"What Darren and I struck for ''Saw III'' was to have an emotionally impactful ending\". As with the previous two films, the ending was only given to the actors who appeared in the final scene at the time it was filmed.
