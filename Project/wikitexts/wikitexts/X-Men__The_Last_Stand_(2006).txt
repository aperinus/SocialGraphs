''[[X2 (film)|X2]]'', as well as the third installment in the [[X-Men (film series)|''X-Men'' film series]], the final installment in the original trilogy and was directed by [[Brett Ratner]]. It features an [[ensemble cast]] including [[Hugh Jackman]], [[Halle Berry]], [[Ian McKellen]], [[Famke Janssen]], [[Anna Paquin]], [[Kelsey Grammer]], [[James Marsden]], [[Rebecca Romijn]], [[Shawn Ashmore]], [[Aaron Stanford]], [[Vinnie Jones]] and [[Patrick Stewart]]. Written by [[Simon Kinberg]] and [[Zak Penn]] from a story by Penn, [[Matthew Vaughn]], [[Michael Dougherty]], and [[Bryan Singer]], the film is loosely based on two ''X-Men'' comic book story arcs: \"[[Gifted (comics)|Gifted]]\" and \"[[The Dark Phoenix Saga]]\", with a plot that revolves around a \"mutant cure\" that causes serious repercussions among [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutants]] and humans, and on the resurrection of [[Jean Grey]] who unleashes a dark force.\n\n[[Bryan Singer]], who had directed the two previous films, ''[[X-Men (film)|X-Men]]'' (2000) and ''X2'', decided to leave the sequel to work on ''[[Superman Returns]]'' (2006). ''X2'' composer [[John Ottman]] and ''X2'' writers [[Dan Harris (screenwriter)|Dan Harris]] and Michael Dougherty also left to work on ''Superman Returns'', as did [[James Marsden]], who had very limited screen time in ''The Last Stand'' before his character was killed off due to his departure from the film. Singer had not even defined the storyline for a third film. [[Matthew Vaughn]], who was initially hired as the new director, left due to personal and professional issues, and was replaced with Ratner. Filming took place from August 2005 to January 2006 with a budget of $210{{nbsp}}million, and was consequently the [[list of most expensive films|most expensive film made]] at the time of its release. It had extensive visual effects created by 11 different companies.\n\n''X-Men: The Last Stand'' premiered in the Out of Competition section at the [[2006 Cannes Film Festival|Cannes Film Festival]],<ref>{{cite web |title=2006 Official Selection - Out of Competition |url=https://m.festival-cannes.com/en/74-editions/retrospective/2006/selection/out-of-competition |website=[[Festival de Cannes]] |access-date=16 August 2022}}</ref> and was released theatrically in the United States on May 26, 2006, by [[20th Century Fox]]. It grossed approximately $459{{nbsp}}million worldwide, becoming the [[2006 in film#Highest-grossing films|seventh-highest-grossing film of 2006]]; it was at the time the highest-grossing film in the series and currently the fourth-highest-grossing film of the franchise. Critical reception was mixed, with praise for its spectacle but criticism for its lack of depth.\n\n== Plot ==\n<!--note: Please do not add more detail. This is supposed to be a plot summary, not a play-by-play. The removal of certain characters or scenes is necessary to keep this section brief and done only when those elements are not essential to the plot. This section has a tendency to expand greatly, becoming overly detailed and full of unnecessarily specific details, but the removal of these details has been asked for and commended on the talk page. As well, note that per [[WP:FILMPLOT]], this section is between 400 and 700 words ONLY-->\nIn 1986, [[Charles Xavier (film character)|Charles Xavier]] and [[Magneto (film character)|Erik Lehnsherr]] meet young [[Jean Grey]] at her parents' house to invite her to join their school, the [[X-Mansion]]. Ten years later, the industrialist Warren Worthington II discovers [[Warren Worthington III|his son]] is a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] as he tries to cut off his wings.\n\nIn the present, Worthington Labs announces it has developed an inoculation to suppress the X-gene that gives [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutants]] their abilities and offer the \"cure\" to any mutant who wants it. The cure is created from the [[genome]] of a young mutant named [[Leech (character)|Jimmy]], who lives at the Worthington facility on [[Alcatraz Island]]. While some mutants are interested in the cure, including [[Rogue (Marvel Comics)|Rogue]], many others are horrified by the announcement. Magneto re-establishes his [[Brotherhood of Mutants]] with those who oppose the cure, warning his followers that the cure will be forcefully used to exterminate the mutant race. With help from [[Pyro (Marvel Comics)|Pyro]], Magneto recruits [[Callisto (comics)|Callisto]] and several other mutants. They attack the mobile prison holding [[Mystique (character)|Mystique]] to free her, also freeing [[Jamie Madrox|Multiple Man]] and [[Juggernaut (character)|Juggernaut]]. Mystique, shielding Magneto from a cure dart, is hit by it and loses her mutant abilities. Magneto abandons her as a result. Meanwhile, [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Scott Summers]], still distraught over the loss of his fianc\u00e9e Jean Grey, drives to her resting location at Alkali Lake. Jean appears to Summers but, as the two kiss, Jean kills him. Sensing trouble, Xavier sends [[Logan (film character)|Logan]] and [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]] to investigate. When they arrive, they find only [[Psychokinesis|telekinetically]] floating rocks, Summers' glasses, and an unconscious Jean.\n\nWhen Logan and Storm return to the X-Mansion, Xavier explains to Logan that when Jean sacrificed herself to save them, she also freed the \"[[Phoenix Force (comics)|Phoenix]]\", a dark and extremely powerful [[Dissociative identity disorder|alternate personality]] which Xavier had telepathically repressed, aware of the Phoenix's godlike destructive potential. Logan is disgusted to learn of this psychic tampering with Jean's mind but, once she awakens, he discovers that she killed Summers and is not the Jean Grey he once knew. The Phoenix emerges, knocks out Logan, and escapes to her childhood home. Magneto learns of Jean's resurrection through Callisto, and the X-Men arrive at the Grey home at the same time as the Brotherhood. Magneto and Xavier go in, and both vie for Jean's loyalty until the Phoenix resurfaces. She destroys the house and kills Xavier by disintegrating him, much to Magneto's horror before leaving with him. After interrogating a depowered Mystique, the FBI discover Magneto's base in the woods. However, the life forms in the camp are all decoy copies of Multiple Man. Magneto and the Brotherhood have gone to storm Alcatraz by using his magnetic manipulation powers to reroute the [[Golden Gate Bridge]]. The remaining X-Men confront the Brotherhood, despite being significantly outnumbered, and arrive just as the military troops who thus far have been neutralizing the attacking mutants are overwhelmed by the Brotherhood.\n\nDuring the fight, [[Kitty Pryde]] saves Jimmy from Juggernaut, who had been sent to kill him by Magneto. Logan has [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]] throw him at Magneto and distract him long enough for [[Beast (comics)|Hank McCoy]] to inject Magneto with the \"cure\" and thus nullify his powers. The Phoenix is awakened and begins to destroy Alcatraz and anyone within range of her powers. Magneto, realising the error of his ways, escapes with the army. Logan realizes that only he can stop the Phoenix due to his healing factor and [[adamantium]] skeleton. When Logan approaches her, Jean momentarily gains control and begs him to save her, and everyone else, by killing her. Logan fatally stabs Jean, killing the Phoenix, but mourns her death. Sometime later, mutant rights are finally obtained and Xavier's school is still operating with Storm as headmistress. The President of the United States appoints McCoy as ambassador to the [[United Nations]]. Rogue reveals to [[Iceman (Marvel Comics)|Bobby Drake]] that she has taken the cure, much to his disappointment, but they hold hands. Meanwhile, Magneto sits at a chessboard in San Francisco, seemingly human and weak. As Magneto gestures toward a metal chess piece, it wobbles slightly<!-- add any interpretation in a footnote with a source -->.\n\nElsewhere, [[Moira MacTaggert]] checks on a comatose patient{{efn|In the DVD commentary, it is revealed that the patient was \"P. Xavier\", Charles Xavier's brain-dead twin brother, whose character was written for the scene. Earlier in the film, MacTaggert spoke in a video about the ways of using mutant powers, such as transferring the mind of a dying man into the body of a patient with no higher brain function, giving an explanation for his resurrection.}} who greets her with Xavier's voice, leaving her startled.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Hugh Jackman]] as [[Logan (film series character)|Logan / Wolverine]]: A Canadian mutant born with hyper-acute, animal-like senses, claws on his hands, and an accelerated healing factor that made it possible to implant a coating of the indestructible metal alloy [[adamantium]] on his skeleton. Jackman was pleased to see that the script allowed Wolverine to expand his character choices, as instead of questioning whether he would remain a loner or join the X-Men, Logan now is asked if he will play a leadership role in the X-Men.<ref name=\"notes\" />\n* [[Halle Berry]] as [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Ororo Munroe / Storm]]: A mutant, who is one of Xavier's earlier students and the leader of the X-Men in Cyclops' absence.

Xavier's death was intended to match the impact of [[Spock]]'s demise in ''[[Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan]]'', as Fox felt the script called for a dramatic turning point.
