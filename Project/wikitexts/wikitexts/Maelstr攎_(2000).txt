It stars [[Marie-Jos\u00e9e Croze]] as a [[Depression (mood)|depressed]] young businesswoman who becomes romantically involved with the son of a man she killed in a [[Hit and run (vehicular)|hit-and-run]] accident. Employing [[fantasy film|fantasy]] and [[comedy film|comedic]] elements, ''Maelstr\u00f6m'' is narrated by a talking fish.\n\nVilleneuve conceived of the story, basing it on his interest in [[car accident]]s and modelling the protagonist after various women he knew. He cast Croze, then a novice actress, in the lead role. Filming took place in Montreal in 1999, with animatronics to depict the fish narrator.\n\nThe film premiered at the [[Montr\u00e9al World Film Festival]] in August 2000 and received positive reviews, with some detractors. It won five [[21st Genie Awards|Genie Awards]], including [[Canadian Screen Award for Best Motion Picture|Best Motion Picture]], and the [[FIPRESCI Prize]] at the [[51st Berlin International Film Festival]].\n\n==Plot==\nWhile being gutted alive by a [[fishmonger]], a dying fish chooses to share a story that took place in [[Quebec]] during the autumn of 1999. A 25-year-old businesswoman named Bibiane Champagne, head of three clothing boutiques, has an [[abortion in Canada|abortion]]. She is interviewed by a journalist about her success and being the daughter of a famous person named Flo Fabert. Bibiane claims business is good, but her partner, her brother Philippe, accosts her for numerous failures. She is supported by her friend, Claire, but struggles with drugs and alcohol.\n\nOne night, while driving, Bibiane accidentally hits a 53-year-old [[Norwegian Canadian]] fishmonger, Annstein Karson, and subsequently [[hit and run (vehicular)|flees the scene]]. Injured, Annstein stumbles back to his apartment, where he dies at the kitchen table. While at a restaurant, Claire and Bibiane order octopus but discover it is stale. The restaurant investigates the poor quality of octopus and realize the usual [[octopus]] trapper, Annstein, is missing, and find him dead. Bibiane reads confirmation of the death in a newspaper, and considers turning herself in; she confides in a stranger on a subway and consults him about turning herself in, but he tells her this will not bring the victim back. She eventually decides to dispose of the evidence, driving her car into a river. She survives, and interprets her survival as a sign that she deserves to recover her life.\n\nThe fishmonger's son Evian, a [[Underwater diving|diver]] who was recently inspecting [[Manicouagan River]], learns Annstein was cremated. This went against his plans for [[burial at sea]]. He encounters Bibiane by chance and she poses as his late father's neighbour. Evian falls in love with her, and she takes him away from a planned flight to have sex at her apartment. He later learns the plane crashed in [[Baie-Comeau]] with no survivors, and realizes Bibiane killed his father. Conflicted about his love for his father's killer, a stranger in a bar (the same man from the subway) tells him to marry her and never tell anyone.\n\nBibiane helps Evian sort through Annstein's possessions, and she accompanies Evian to [[Lofoten]] to dispose of the ashes. Finally, the fish [[narrator]] decides to conclude his story by revealing the [[meaning of life]], but is promptly killed mid-sentence.\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\n[[File:Devonianfishes ntm 1905 smit 1929.gif|200px|thumb|Villeneuve conceived of a fantastic element for his story, with a talking fish narrator; he modeled the character on [[prehistoric fish]].<ref name=\"Kamloops\"/>]]\nDirector [[Denis Villeneuve]] conceived of a story, that would revolve around a [[car accident]]:\n{{blockquote|It's more a film about responsibility and [clarity]. Car crashes are the most dramatic events common and closest to us. That's why I'm very interested in them ... The film is a dark tale. One of its subjects is mythology. There's a strange narrator telling the story from a fantasy world. It's a hyper-realistic film, but it goes very close to [[fantasy film|fantasy]] at some points.<ref name=\"Dillon\"/>}}\n\nFor Bibiane, Villeneuve modeled the character after numerous women he knew, one of whom he described as a \"[[mythomaniac]]\", like Bibiane.<ref name=\"Royer\"/> He began making notes on the story in spring 1998, while finishing his film ''[[August 32nd on Earth]]'', but set it aside as \"too difficult\", given its detached heroine. He began working on the ''Maelstr\u00f6m'' screenplay again later that year, due to his persistent visions of the story.<ref name=\"Dillon\"/> He began pitching the screenplay, and later said some readers told him it gave them nightmares, and that it was \"too dark and heavy\", though Villeneuve regarded it as nearly comedic.<ref name=\"Hays\"/> Downplaying the dark subject matter, he described the story as \"a playful call to be responsible and to be careful\".<ref>{{cite news |title=Review Fish hooks ; Quebec film 'Maelstrom' tells deep tale |last=Howell |first=Peter |date=8 September 2000 |newspaper=[[The Toronto Star]] |page=D02}}</ref> In his efforts for \"balance\" in respect to the abortion scene, Villeneuve said he was [[pro-choice]] but the operation \"should never be taken lightly\".<ref name=\"Hays\">{{cite news |title=Filmmaker as a fisher of tales |last=Hays |first=Matthew |date=31 August 2000 |newspaper=[[The Globe and Mail]] |page=R.3}}</ref>\n\nThe inspiration for the narration was a [[trout]] he had for dinner, which gave him [[food poisoning]].

Villeneuve explained this, saying, \"For me it was the kind of image which was like all the storytellers from the beginning of humanity trying to tell a story, the same story over and over again. I think it's an image that is like my relationship with cinema.
