Based on the ''[[Arabian Nights]]'' tales of [[Sinbad the Sailor]], it is the second of three ''Sinbad'' films released by [[Columbia Pictures]], the others being ''[[The 7th Voyage of Sinbad]]'' (1958) and ''[[Sinbad and the Eye of the Tiger]]'' (1977). The film stars [[John Phillip Law]], [[Tom Baker]], Takis Emmanuel and [[Caroline Munro]]. It was a worldwide box office hit and won the first [[Saturn Award for Best Fantasy Film]].\n\n==Plot==\nWhile sailing, Sinbad comes across a golden tablet dropped by a mysterious flying creature. That night, he dreams about a man dressed in black, repeatedly calling his name, as well as a beautiful girl with an eye tattooed on the palm of her right hand.\n\nA sudden storm throws the ship off course, and Sinbad and his men find themselves near a coastal town in the country of Marabia. Swimming to the beach, Sinbad encounters the man from his dream, an evil magician named Koura, who demands that he turn over the amulet. Sinbad narrowly escapes into the city and meets the Grand [[Vizier]] of Marabia, who has been acting as regent following the death of the [[sultan]], who had no heir. The Vizier, who wears a golden mask to hide his disfigured face, explains that Sinbad's amulet is but one piece of a puzzle, of which the Vizier has another. The Vizier relates to Sinbad a legend, which claims that the three pieces, when joined together, will reveal a map showing the way to the fabled Fountain of Destiny on the lost continent of [[Lemuria (continent)|Lemuria]]. He who takes the three pieces to the Fountain will receive \"youth, a shield of darkness and a crown of untold riches\".\n\nSinbad agrees to help the Vizier in his quest for the Fountain and they join forces against Koura, who is bent on using the Fountain's gifts to conquer Marabia. Koura had previously locked the Vizier in a room and set it on fire, resulting in the disfiguring of the Vizier's face. The creature that dropped the gold tablet was Koura's minion, a [[homunculus]] created by his black magic. Koura uses the creature to spy on Sinbad and the Vizier and learn of their plans. When Sinbad and the Vizier discover and catch the homunculus, it destroys itself.\n\nShortly afterward, Sinbad meets the woman in his dream, a slave girl named Margiana. Her master hires Sinbad to make a man out of his lazy, no-good son Haroun. Sinbad agrees on the condition that Margiana comes along. Koura hires a ship and a crew of his own and follows Sinbad, using his magic several times to try to stop Sinbad. However, each attempt drains away part of his life force, and he ages noticeably each time.\n\nOn his journey, Sinbad encounters numerous perils, including a wooden [[Siren (mythology)|siren]] figurehead on his ship, animated by Koura's magic, which manages to steal the map, which enables Koura to locate Lemuria. The wizard uses another homunculus to overhear the [[Oracle]] of All Knowledge describe to Sinbad what he will face in his search for the Fountain. Koura seals the men inside the Oracle's cave, but Sinbad uses a makeshift rope to get everyone out. Haroun manages to destroy the homunculus as it attacks Sinbad. After he is captured by hostile natives, Koura animates a six-armed statue of [[Kali]], causing the natives to set him free. Sinbad and his men arrive soon after, fight and defeat Kali. As she falls and breaks apart, they find the final piece of the puzzle within Kali's shattered remains. The natives capture Sinbad and his crew, but after they see the eye tattoo on Margiana's hand, they instead decide to sacrifice her to a one-eyed [[centaur]], the natives' God of the Single Eye and the Fountain's Guardian of Evil.\n\nKoura arrives at the Fountain of Destiny. When he drops the first piece of the tablet into the Fountain, his life force is restored. He then summons the centaur, which fights the Fountain's Guardian of Good, a [[griffin]]. Meanwhile, Sinbad and the others escape, rescue Margiana and reach the Fountain. They watch as the centaur kills the griffin with Koura's aid, then Sinbad slays the centaur. Koura drops the second piece into the Fountain, which turns him invisible (the \"shield of darkness\"), and engages Sinbad in a swordfight. Sinbad is barely able to fend off his invisible foe, until Koura makes a fatal mistake by stepping in the Fountain itself, which reveals his silhouette, enabling Sinbad to kill him. Sinbad then drops in the third piece, and a jewel-encrusted crown rises from the depths. Instead of donning it, Sinbad gives the crown to the Vizier. When the Vizier dons the crown, his mask dissolves, revealing his restored, unscarred face.\n\nTheir quest completed, Sinbad and his crew journey back to Marabia. When Margiana asks him why he did not take the crown himself, Sinbad explains that he enjoys his freedom more than kinghood. With Margiana as his wife, and Haroun as a new member of his crew, they sail into the sunset.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[John Phillip Law]] as Sinbad, the protagonist\n* [[Tom Baker]] as Prince Koura, the main antagonist of the film ([[Christopher Lee]] was a front-runner to play Koura). Baker's performance helped him get the lead role of the [[Fourth Doctor]] in the TV series ''[[Doctor Who]]'', because the show's producer, [[Barry Letts]], was impressed with his performance.<ref>''Doctor Who the Handbook: The Fourth Doctor'' Doctor Who Books, 1992, pg 43.</ref>\n* Takis Emmanuel as Achmed (Emmanuel was dubbed by [[Robert Rietti]])\n* [[Caroline Munro]] as Margiana \n* [[Douglas Wilmer]] as the Grand Vizier of Marabia\n* [[Gr\u00e9goire Aslan]] as Hakim (as Gregoire Aslan)\n* David Garfield as Abdul (as John D. Garfield)\n* [[Kurt Christian]] as Haroun\n* [[Martin Shaw]] as Rachid\n* [[Aldo Sambrell]] as Omar \n* [[Robert Shaw (actor)|Robert Shaw]] as the Oracle of All Knowledge (uncredited)\n\nScreenwriter [[Brian Clemens]] helped Munro land the role of Margiana:\n<blockquote>\"I got the part \u2013 I had been signed by Hammer, for one year, for a contract, out of which I did two films, one being ''[[Dracula AD 1972]]'', and the second one being ''[[Captain Kronos \u2013 Vampire Hunter]]'', which, kind of, would come full-circle, to ''Sinbad''. It was written and directed by Brian Clemens, who wrote the screenplay for ''The Golden Voyage of Sinbad'', so, I was lucky enough to be chosen for ''Captain Kronos'', and they were searching for somebody to do ''Sinbad'', and they wanted a big name, somebody American, or well-known, but Brian said \"No\". He kept lobbying [[Charles Schneer]] [producer] and [[Ray Harryhausen]] \u2014 saying: 'I think you should come and look at the rushes, and see what you think, because I think she's right'. So, they said \"No\", but, eventually, Brian persuaded them to do that, and they saw the rushes, and that was how I got the part.\"<ref>{{dead link|date=July 2015}}[http://www.margiana.freeservers.com/about.html Caroline Munro Interview] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051227192123/http://www.margiana.freeservers.com/about.html |date=27 December 2005}}.

We felt there was a new audience that was ready for it. We knew of no other producers who were considering this type of material, largely because they probably didn\u2019t know how to handle it on a basis where it became economically viable.\"{{sfn|Scapperotti|Bartholomew|1974|p=42}} Harryhausen did a dozen master sketches which, Schneer said \"we felt would be intriguing and interesting and characteristic of the period.\" They then hired Brian Clemens to do a screenplay based on the sketches. Harryhausen was given a co producer credit in this film to reflect his greater involvement in the writing, editing and casting process.{{sfn|Scapperotti|Bartholomew|1974|p=42}}\n\nSchneer says Law was cast at the suggestion of Columbia. \"He wasn't very athletic, and he didn't handle a sword as well as Kerwin did,\" said the producer. \"Frankly, he was kind of flat-footed, but he did the best he could. He used a Middle Eastern accent that I wasn't altogether pleased about, either.\"<ref name=\"steve\">{{cite magazine|magazine=Starlog|first=Steve|last=Swires|url=https://archive.org/details/starlog_magazine-152/page/n67/mode/1up/search/%22first+men+in+the+moon%22+?q=%22first+men+in+the+moon%22+harryhausen|date=March 1990|title=Merchant of the Magicks Part Three|page=67}}</ref>\n\nCaroline Munro was given the female lead. Schneer said \"We wanted her to project that sex appeal, because that was what was happening at the time in the film business. But we were still making a [[Motion Picture Association film rating system|G-rated]] picture, so we went for G-rated sex appeal.\"<ref name=\"steve\"/>\n\nProducers Charles Schneer and Ray Harryhausen based their production in Spain ([[Madrid]] as well as the island of [[Majorca]]) to take advantage of the local rugged scenery. At one point the possibility of filming some scenes at the landmark [[Alhambra]] palace in [[Granada]] was raised; however, rental fees demanded by local authorities proved prohibitive. Eventually the company was able to film at the [[Royal Palace of La Almudaina]]. Other scenes were done in the Caves of [[Art\u00e0]] (the temple of the Oracle) and the Torrent de Pareis<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.afi.com/members/catalog/DetailView.aspx?s=&Movie=67592|title = Home}}</ref>\n\nIt was filmed from June 19, 1972 to August 1972.\n\nAn early charcoal/pencil illustration showed the one-eyed [[centaur]] battling a giant [[Neanderthal]]-like creature, who was later ultimately replaced by a [[griffin]] in the final version. The idea of the Neanderthal was later featured in ''[[Sinbad and the Eye of the Tiger]]'' (1977).<ref>Dalton, Tony. ''The Art of Ray Harryhuasen.''
