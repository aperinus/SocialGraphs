It is a fictionalized account of Shafer's reign as ''[[Playgirl]]'' magazine's 1992 \"Man of the Year\" and his struggle with reconciling his public persona as a [[sex symbol]] to women with his identity as a [[gay]] man. Shafer combines mock interviews (both with some of the actual people involved and with actors standing in for the actual people) with archive footage from Shafer's appearances on [[talk show]]s like ''[[Phil Donahue|Donahue]]'', ''[[Maury (TV series)|The Maury Povich Show]]'' and ''[[The Jerry Springer Show]]'' (along with an early appearance on ''[[Dance Fever]]'') and recreations of events like his Playgirl photoshoots, his \"fantasy date\" with a ''Playgirl'' reader and the death of his friend Pledge Cartwright (played by actor [[Bill Brochtrup]]) of an [[AIDS]]-related illness to relate the story.\n\n==Critical response==\n''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' gave ''Man of the Year'' a generally favorable review, calling the film \"pleasant to watch and intermittently clever.\"<ref name = variety>{{cite news  | last = Levy | first = Emmanuel | title = Man of the Year | work = Variety | date = 1995-07-17 | url = https://www.variety.com/review/VE1117904280.html?categoryid=31&cs=1 | accessdate = 2008-03-23}}</ref> However, it notes that Shafer's writing is \"uneven\" and that the film's \"structure is a bit repetitive.\"<ref name = variety /> ''[[The New Yorker]]'' largely concurred, noting that Shafer \"keep[s] condescension at bay with some nice comic spins\"<ref>{{cite news  | last = Diones | first = Bruce | title = Man of the Year | work = New Yorker  | date = 1996-04-01 | url = https://www.newyorker.com/arts/reviews/film/man_of_the_year_shafer | accessdate = 2008-03-23}}</ref> but finding the use of the death of Shafer's friend as Shafer's catalyst for coming out to be self-serving. The ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' was far harsher, deriding the film as a \"vanity\" production and complaining \"There's no shape to ''Man of the Year'', no forward movement.
