[[Ice Cube]], [[Peter Stormare]], [[Jillian Bell]], [[Amber Stevens]], and [[Wyatt Russell]] also star. It is the [[sequel]] to the 2012 film ''[[21 Jump Street (film)|21 Jump Street]]'', which is in turn based on<!--Please do not change. A film based on a TV series is never referred to as a \"loose sequel\" even if it takes place within the same continuity after the series has ended.--> the [[21 Jump Street|television series of the same name]]. The plot follows police officers Schmidt and Jenko as they go undercover at a college in order to find the supplier of a new drug.\n\nPlans for a ''Jump Street'' sequel began the week of the first film's release. Hill and Tatum were quickly confirmed to be reprising their roles, while Miller and Lord announced they'd be returning to direct in July 2013. Filming took place from September to December of that same year in [[New Orleans]], Louisiana, as well as [[San Juan, Puerto Rico]].\n\nThe film was released on June 4, 2014 in [[New York City]], and was theatrically released in the United States nine days later by [[Columbia Pictures]] and [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]. It received generally positive reviews, and grossed $331 million worldwide. A third film, as well as a possible crossover with the ''[[Men in Black (franchise)|Men in Black]]'' franchise, were discussed but never came to fruition; a female-led spin-off was later in development but also did not come to fruition.\n\n==Plot==\nTwo years following their success in the [[21 Jump Street (film)|21 Jump Street]] program, Schmidt and Jenko are back on the streets investigating narcotics trafficking. However, after failing in the pursuit of a group of drug dealers led by The Ghost, Deputy Chief Hardy puts the duo back on the undercover program to work for Captain Dickson \u2013 now located across the street at 22 Jump Street. Their assignment is to go undercover as college students and locate the supplier of a synthetic drug known as \"WHY-PHY\" (Work Hard? Yes, Play Hard? Yes) that killed a student photographed buying it on campus from a dealer.\n\nAt college, Jenko befriends a pair of [[Jock (stereotype)|jocks]] named Zook and Rooster, who soon become the prime suspects of the investigation. Jenko starts attending parties with the jocks who do not take as kindly to Schmidt. Meanwhile, Schmidt gets the attention of an art student, Maya, by feigning an interest in [[slam poetry]]. After hitting it off immediately, the two have sex together, to the chagrin of Maya's roommate Mercedes, and Schmidt later finds out that Maya is the daughter of Captain Dickson, whom Schmidt bragged to about \"getting laid\", much to his dismay. Despite sleeping together, Maya tells Schmidt not to take it seriously, and he starts to feel left out as Jenko bonds more and more with Zook who encourages him to join the football team.\n\nWhen Schmidt and Jenko are unable to identify the dealer, they visit Mr. Walters and Eric in prison for advice (with Eric being in a forced relationship with Mr. Walters, who received a [[vagina]] after Schmidt shot his penis off), and Walters points out a unique tattoo on the arm of the dealer in the photograph. Whilst hanging out with Zook and Rooster, Jenko notices that Rooster does not have the tattoo but sees it on Zook's arm. Schmidt and Jenko are invited to join a [[Fraternities and sororities|fraternity]] led by the jocks, but Schmidt refuses, furthering the tension between the two as Jenko passes their requirements. They later realize that Zook is not the dealer but rather another customer. Soon afterwards, they find The Ghost and his men on campus, but The Ghost again evades them. Jenko reveals to Schmidt that he has been offered a football [[scholarship]] with Zook and is uncertain about his future as a police officer. Afterwards, Schmidt reveals his true identity and moves out of the dorm, angering Maya.\n\n[[Spring break]] arrives, and Schmidt goes after The Ghost. He is joined by Jenko, so the two can have one final mission together. The pair head to the beach where The Ghost is likely to be dealing WHY-PHY. Inside a bar, they find Mercedes, who is The Ghost's daughter, giving instructions to other dealers. The pair, backed up by Dickson and the rest of Jump Street, ambush the meeting. The Ghost flees, while Mercedes is knocked out by Schmidt. While pursuing The Ghost, Jenko is shot in the shoulder. The Ghost attempts to escape in a helicopter; Schmidt and Jenko manage to jump across to it, but they fall into the sea and Jenko is able to throw a grenade into the helicopter. The Ghost celebrates his victory prematurely while the grenade explodes. Jenko tells Schmidt that he still wants to be a police officer as he believes their differences help their partnership, and the two reconcile in front of a cheering crowd. Dickson approaches them claiming to have a new mission undercover at a [[medical school]].\n\nDuring the [[end credits]], Jenko and Schmidt go on a variety of undercover missions to different schools, which are portrayed as 22 fictional sequels, an animated series, a video game, and a toy line. One mission features [[Booker (TV series)|Detective Booker]] while another sees the return of The Ghost, who survived the helicopter explosion. The post-credits scene shows Eric and Mr. Walters laying in bed together, with Mr. Walters revealing that he's pregnant with Eric's child.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Jonah Hill]] as Morton Schmidt\n* [[Channing Tatum]] as Greg Jenko\n* [[Peter Stormare]] as The Ghost\n* [[Wyatt Russell]] as Zook Haythe\n* [[Amber Stevens]] as Maya Dickson<ref name=\"chicagotribune1\">{{cite news |first=Justin |last=Kroll |url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/sns-201309061500reedbusivarietyn1200601582-20130906,0,3522482.story |title=Amber Stevens Signs Up For '22 Jump Street' |work=Chicago Tribune |date=September 6, 2013 |access-date=October 1, 2013 |url-status=dead  |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131216204404/http://www.chicagotribune.com/sns-201309061500reedbusivarietyn1200601582-20130906,0,3522482.story |archive-date=December 16, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n* [[Jillian Bell]] as Mercedes\n* [[Ice Cube]] as Captain Dickson\n* [[Kenny and Keith Lucas|Keith Lucas]] as Keith Yang\n* [[Kenny and Keith Lucas|Kenny Lucas]] as Kenny Yang\n* [[Nick Offerman]] as Deputy Chief Hardy\n* [[Jimmy Tatro]] as Rooster\n* [[Craig Roberts]] as Spencer\n* [[Marc Evan Jackson]] as Dr. Murphy\n* [[Queen Latifah]] as Mrs. Dickson (uncredited)\n* [[Diplo]] as Himself\n* [[Dustin Nguyen]] as Vietnamese Jesus / Harry Truman Ioki\n* [[Richard Grieco]] as Dennis Booker\n* [[Dave Franco]] as Eric Molson (uncredited)\n* [[Rob Riggle]] as Mr. Walters (uncredited)\n* [[H.
