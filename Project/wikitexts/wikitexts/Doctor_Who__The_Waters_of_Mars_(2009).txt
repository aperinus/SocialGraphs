He dons a spacesuit to walk to the base, where inside he is detained by its crew led by Captain Adelaide Brooke. As they interrogate him, he discovers that today is a \"fixed point\" in time; the base will explode, killing the entire crew, but Adelaide's death will inspire her granddaughter to explore the stars. He tries to stay uninvolved, but Adelaide forces him to assist her in responding to an alert from the remote biodome.\n \nTwo crewmen, Andrew Stone and Tarak Ital, appear to be in a zombie-like state, generating copious amounts of water. A third crewmate, Margaret Caine gets infected and they quarantine her while sealing off the biodome. From observation, they discover that the infection is by an intelligent virus, the Flood, and now seeks to get to Earth. The Doctor suspects the Flood were sealed in the glacier the base was using for water by the [[Ice Warrior]]s aeons ago, and a bad filter allowed the virus to infect the crew. Adelaide realises the remaining crew have not yet touched that source of water and are uninfected, and orders the crew to evacuate to their rocket back to Earth while setting the base to self-destruct. Before departing, the Doctor is forced to explain to Adelaide what he knows happens and why he cannot get involved.\n \nThe Doctor starts walking back when he hears cries for help: the infected crew have broken the biodome seal and are now attacking the central hub with massive amounts of water, infecting several others. The rocket's pilot is infected, but he sacrifices himself by causing the rocket to self-destruct to strand the Flood, at the cost of stranding the remaining crew as well. The Doctor races back and rescues Adelaide and the last surviving crew, Yuri and Mia, via the [[TARDIS]] moments before the base destructs, killing all the infected beings and the Flood itself. He returns them to Earth, arriving outside Adelaide's home. The Doctor insists that he now has the power to change the future of the human race and no-one can stop him, declaring himself the 'Time Lord Victorious'. Understanding the wrongness of his actions and recognizing that the future cannot change, Adelaide steps into her home and kills herself. The Doctor is shocked; he realises that history has not changed save for knowledge of the base's fate from Yuri and Mia. [[Ood|Ood Sigma]] appears in the street. The Doctor sees this as a message and asks if it is time for him to die. Unresponsive, Sigma vanishes. Back in the TARDIS, the Doctor refuses to face his death and departs in the TARDIS.\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Doctor Who 2009 The Waters of Mars Footage 1.ogv|thumb|Filming of \"The Waters of Mars\".]]\n\"The Waters of Mars\" was originally conceived as a Christmas special with the title \"Red Christmas\".<ref name=\"Ref_2009\">{{cite web | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00nyymd | title=Doctor Who: The Commentary | publisher=BBC Radio 7 | date=2009-11-16 }}</ref> In this story's accompanying episode of ''Doctor Who Confidential'', it was confirmed that Bowie Base One is named after [[David Bowie]], the writer and singer of \"[[Life on Mars?]]\".<ref name=\"confidential\">{{cite video | title=[[Doctor Who Confidential#2009 Specials|Doctor Who Confidential episode 61]] | people=[[Russell T Davies]] | publisher=[[BBC]] | date=2009-11-15 }}</ref> Filming for the special began on 23 February 2009.<ref name=\"gg406\" /> In late February, [[David Tennant]], Duncan and other actors were seen filming in Victoria Place, [[Newport, Wales|Newport]].<ref name=\"newport\">{{cite news | first=Tim | last=Lewis | title=Fans gather to see Doctor Who's new assistant | work=[[Western Mail (Wales)|Western Mail]] | date=2009-03-02 | url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/2009/03/02/fans-gather-to-see-doctor-who-s-new-assistant-91466-23040383/ }}<br/>{{cite news | first=Matt | last=Nicholls | title=Doctor Who teams up with award-winner Lindsay Duncan | work=[[Wales on Sunday]] | date=2009-03-01 | url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/showbiz-and-lifestyle/showbiz/2009/03/01/doctor-who-teams-up-with-award-winner-lindsay-duncan-91466-23035393/ }}</ref> The filming took place on a city street, which the production team covered with artificial snow.<ref name=\"newport\" /><ref name=\"bbc_victoria\">\n{{cite web | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/arts/sites/doctor-who-wales/alllocations/newport-victoria-place | title= Walesarts, Victoria Place, Newport | publisher=BBC | access-date=2010-05-30 }}</ref> The glasshouse scenes were filmed in the [[National Botanic Garden of Wales]], [[Carmarthenshire]].<ref name=\"Ref_gow\">{{cite web | url=http://www.gardenofwales.org.uk/en/351.html | title=National Botanic Garden of Wales : Doctor Who | publisher=Garden of Wales | url-status=dead | archive-date=2009-10-25 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091025090732/http://www.gardenofwales.org.uk/en/351.html }}</ref> Also present during filming were a small robot inscribed with the word \"GADGET\" and [[Ood|Ood Sigma]] from the 2008 episode \"[[Planet of the Ood]]\".<ref name=\"Anders2009\">{{cite web | last=Anders | first=Charlie Jane | author-link=Charlie Anders | title=The Comeback That Brings The Doctor To His Knees | url=http://io9.com/5162583/the-comeback-that-brings-the-doctor-to-his-knees | work=[[io9]] | publisher=[[Gawker Media]] | date=2009-03-02 }}<br/>{{cite web | last=Anders | first=Charlie Jane | author-link=Charlie Anders | title=The Genesis Of Nero's Star Trek Quest.
