Starring [[Zooey Deschanel]], [[Neal McDonough]], [[Alan Cumming]], [[Raoul Trujillo]], [[Kathleen Robertson]], and [[Richard Dreyfuss]], the miniseries is a reimagining of the classic 1900 novel ''[[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz]]'' by [[L. Frank Baum]], with [[science fiction]] and additional [[fantasy]] elements added. It focuses on the adventures of a small-town waitress named DG who is pulled into a magical realm called the O.Z., ruled by the tyrannical sorceress Azkadellia. Together with her companions Glitch, Raw, and Cain, DG journeys to uncover her memories, find lost connections, and foil Azkadellia's plot to trap the O.Z. in eternal darkness.\n\nCosting $20 million to produce, the first part of the miniseries was the highest-rated program in its time slot, with 6.4 million viewers; the miniseries itself would be the highest-rated miniseries of 2007. It was nominated for nine Emmy awards, winning one, and was also nominated for a Critics' Choice Award. Critics gave it mixed reviews, with some praising the acting, soundtrack, and visual effects, while others found it overly grim and bleak.\n\n==Plot==\nDG is a small-town waitress who feels that she does not fit into her [[Kansas]] farm life and has visions of a lavender-eyed woman warning her that a storm is coming. DG's visions are realized when the sorceress Azkadellia, tyrannical ruler of the O.Z. (Outer Zone), sends her Longcoat soldiers through a \"travel storm\" to kill DG. DG escapes through the storm into the O.Z. and befriends several of its inhabitants: Glitch, who had half of his brain removed by Azkadellia; Wyatt Cain, a former \"Tin Man\" law enforcer who was locked in an iron suit for years as punishment for opposing Azkadellia; and Raw, a \"viewer\" whose people have been enslaved by Azkadellia.\n\nDG receives a magical symbol on her palm and learns that her Kansan parents are [[Android (robot)|androids]] and that her real mother is the lavender-eyed woman of her visions. Visiting the Mystic Man in Central City and continuing on to the Northern Island, the group learns that Glitch was once the advisor to the Queen of the O.Z. and that DG and Azkadellia are actually sisters and the daughters of the Queen. DG remembers that Azkadellia killed her using dark magic when they were children, but their mother revived DG by light magic and gave her secret instructions on how to find the Emerald of the Eclipse, which Azkadellia now seeks. Azkadellia confronts the group with her Longcoats and bat-winged monkey \"mobats\", capturing DG and Raw. Cain fights the Longcoat captain Zero and learns that his wife and son, whom he thought Zero had killed, are still alive. Zero shoots Cain, sending him falling into a lake of ice.\n\nGlitch rescues and revives Cain, and they journey to Azkadellia's castle to rescue DG. Azkadellia interrogates DG, learning that the Emerald of the Eclipse is protected by the \"Gray Gale\". The Mystic Man is killed by Azkadellia after advising DG to head south. DG is freed by a small dog who is revealed to be a shapeshifter named Tutor (Blu Mankuma), her childhood teacher who is also nicknamed [[Toto (Oz)|Toto]]. DG, Glitch, Raw, and Cain head south with Tutor, not knowing that he is marking their path for Azkadellia's mobats to follow. Along the way, DG rediscovers some of her magical abilities\u2014restoring a withered fruit tree in the fields of the Papay \u2014 and Cain discovers his wife's grave. More of DG's memories return in the lake country of Finaqua: As children DG and Azkadellia were very close, but that changed when DG accidentally released the spirit of an ancient, evil witch from a cave. The sisters' magic would have protected them if they stayed together linking hands, but DG fled and the witch possessed Azkadellia. DG realizes that all of the tragedies which have befallen the O.Z. are the result of that mistake she made as a child.\n\nThe party heads farther south in search of DG's father Ahamo (Ted Whittall). Tutor's treachery is discovered, but he is allowed to stay with the group in his canine form. In the Realm of the Unwanted, they are led into a trap: Glitch, Raw, and Cain are captured by Zero, but are freed by resistance fighters led by Cain's son Jeb (Andrew Francis). Zero reveals the scope of Azkadellia's plan, which is to use the Emerald of the Eclipse in combination with a machine called the Sun Seeder to lock the O.Z.'s two suns in place behind the moon during an upcoming eclipse, covering the land in permanent darkness. The Sun Seeder had been designed by Glitch during his time as the Queen's adviser, and the removed portion of his brain is being used to control it. Meanwhile, DG meets Ahamo and the two travel by [[hot air balloon]] to the hidden [[mausoleum]] of the O.Z.'s royal line. DG learns that the Gray Gale is [[Dorothy Gale]], her \"greatest great-grandmother\" and \"the first slipper\" to travel to the O.Z. from Earth. She enters Dorothy's tomb, finding herself in a black-and-white representation of her Kansas farm and receiving the Emerald from Dorothy. Azkadellia arrives, capturing both Ahamo and the Emerald and leaving DG trapped in a [[sarcophagus]]. DG escapes using magic and is reunited with her friends, and together they infiltrate Azkadellia's fortress as she locks the suns in place. DG clasps hands with Azkadellia, freeing her from the witch's possession just as her companions reverse the Sun Seeder's pulse, destroying the witch. DG and Azkadellia are reunited with their parents as the suns emerge from behind the moon, shedding their light on the O.Z.\n\n==Cast and characters==\n[[File:Tin Man cast.jpg|right|thumb|250px|The primary cast of ''Tin Man''.
