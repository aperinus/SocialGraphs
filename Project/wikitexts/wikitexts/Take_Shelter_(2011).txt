The plot follows a young husband and father (Shannon) who is plagued by a series of [[apocalypse|apocalyptic]] visions, and questions whether to shelter his family from a coming storm, or from himself and his increasing worries over having [[Schizophrenia|paranoid schizophrenia]]. \n\nThe film won two [[Saturn Awards|Saturn Award]]s, [[Saturn Award for Best Writing|Best Writing]] for Nichols and [[Saturn Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] for Shannon, and was nominated for two more, [[Saturn Award for Best Horror or Thriller Film|Best Horror or Thriller Film]] and [[Saturn Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]] for Chastain. It explores the themes of [[masculinity]], [[Mental disorder|mental illness]], and the lengths people go to protect the ones they love.\n\n==Plot==\nIn [[LaGrange, Ohio]], Curtis LaForche has apocalyptic dreams and visual and auditory hallucinations of rain \"like fresh motor oil\", swarms of menacing black birds, and being harmed by people close to him. He hides all of this from his wife, Samantha, and their deaf daughter, Hannah.  He instead channels his anxieties into a compulsive obsession to improve and enlarge a storm shelter in his backyard; however, his increasingly strange behavior \u2013 including a tendency to cut ties with anyone in his life that has harmed him only in his dreams \u2013 strains his relationship with his family, friends, employer, and the close-knit town. He also puts his construction job in jeopardy as he borrows equipment from the company to build his shelter.\n\nTo deal with his increased [[insomnia]] and apocalyptic visions, Curtis grudgingly sees a counselor at a free clinic, with whom he talks about his family's psychological history.  His mother, Sarah, has [[paranoid schizophrenia]] that surfaced in her at about the same age that Curtis is now. He's worried that he may also have the disorder.\n\nIn order to get the expanded storm shelter done, Curtis gets a home improvement loan he can't afford to start building the shelter \u2013 all without telling his wife.  Samantha becomes angry when she discovers the project. After Curtis takes more than the prescribed dose of a sedative and has a seizure, Samantha calls an ambulance.  He recovers, then finally explains the truth to her, including his dreams.\n\nCurtis begins to miss more work, causing tensions with his boss, as he and Samantha make preparations for the [[cochlear implant]] surgery Hannah is to undergo in six weeks' time.  Having been informed of the borrowed work equipment, Curtis's boss fires him and gives him only two weeks' worth of medical insurance benefits, after placing Dewart, the close friend and co-worker whom Curtis asked to help him start construction of the shelter, on two weeks' unpaid administrative leave.\n\nCurtis buys gas masks for his family and extends his previous employer's health insurance policy for a few extra weeks.  After he finds out that his counselor at the free clinic has suddenly transferred and been replaced with a new one, he walks out.  Tensions linger between Curtis and Sam over his loss of a job/income at such a crucial time for their family.  Samantha gets Curtis to see an actual psychiatrist and demands that they attend a social function so she can restore some sense of normalcy to their strained, increasingly isolated life. At a Lions Club community gathering, a bitter Dewart, who has been spreading gossip that Curtis is crazy, is angrily provoked and punches him.  Enraged, Curtis knocks Dewart to the floor, overturns a table and unleashes a frightening verbal tirade upon everyone present.  He prophetically shouts that a devastating storm is coming, insisting that none of them are prepared.\n\nLater, a tornado warning sends him and his family into the shelter.  After they awaken, Curtis reluctantly removes his gas mask, prompted by Samantha.  They go to open the shelter doors, but he still hears a storm outside. His wife implores him, insisting that there's no storm and that he needs to open the door. After a tense standoff, Curtis throws open the doors into the blinding sun; a strong-but-bearable storm has passed, and neighbors are cleaning up broken tree limbs and other yard debris as power company trucks restore electricity along the street.\n\nA psychiatrist advises the couple to go through with their planned, annual beach vacation, but that Curtis will need to get psychiatric care in a facility away from his family upon their return.  At [[Myrtle Beach, South Carolina|Myrtle Beach]], while Curtis is building sand castles with Hannah, she signs the word \"storm\".  As Samantha exits their beachhouse, the thick, oily rain that Curtis spoke of begins to fall, staining her outstretched hand.  Samantha looks up to a bigger version of the ominous storm clouds Curtis had seen, massing over the ocean; tornado-like waterspouts reach down to the ocean's surface, and the tide pulls back as a [[tsunami]] looms in the distance. Samantha and Curtis exchange glances, as Samantha assuringly whispers \"ok.\" The scene cuts to black, leaving the truth of the reality a mystery.\n\n==Cast==\n<!--- [[WP:NOTDATABASE]] - cast and order per closing tombstone stand-alone credits, roles per closing credits scroll --->\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Michael Shannon]] as Curtis\n* [[Jessica Chastain]] as Samantha\n* [[Shea Whigham]] as Dewart\n* [[Katy Mixon]] as Nat\n* [[Ray McKinnon (actor)|Ray McKinnon]] as Kyle\n* [[Lisa Gay Hamilton]] as Kendra\n* Robert Longstreet as Jim\n* [[Kathy Baker]] as Sarah\n}}\n\n==Release==\n''Take Shelter'' [[Film premiere|premiered]] in January 2011 at the [[Sundance Film Festival]], and [[Sony Pictures Classics]] acquired rights to distribute the film in North America, [[Latin America]], Australia, and New Zealand.<ref>{{cite news | last=Cox | first=Gordon | url=https://www.variety.com/article/VR1118030425 | title=Sony snaps up 'Take Shelter' at Sundance | journal=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date=January 18, 2011 }}</ref> The film also screened in May 2011 at the [[Cannes Film Festival]], where it won the 50th Critics' Week Grand Prix.<ref>{{cite journal | last=Keslassy | first=Elsa | url=https://www.variety.com/article/VR1118037340 | title='Take Shelter' wins Critics' Week | journal=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date=May 19, 2011 }}</ref> It also received the Fipresci award from the [[International Federation of Film Critics]], sharing it with ''[[Le Havre (film)|Le Havre]]'' and ''[[The Minister]]''.<ref>{{cite journal | last=Hopewell | first=John | url=https://www.variety.com/article/VR1118037421 | title='Le Havre' win top Fipresci crits' award | journal=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date=May 21, 2011 }}</ref> In September 2011, ''Take Shelter'' was shown at the 37th [[Deauville American Film Festival]], where it beat 13 other contenders to win the festival's grand prize.<ref>{{cite journal | last=Keslassy | first=Elsa | url=https://www.variety.com/article/VR1118042627 | title='Shelter' finds room at top | journal=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date=September 11, 2011 }}</ref> Later in September, ''Take Shelter'' was shown at the 2011 [[Toronto International Film Festival]]<ref>{{cite journal | last=Feinberg | first=Scott | url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/race/toronto-2011-audience-award-go-236836 | title=Toronto 2011: 'Where Do We Go Now?'

It has a rating of 92% on [[Rotten Tomatoes]], based on 164 reviews, with an average score of 8.02/10. The consensus states \"Michael Shannon gives a powerhouse performance and the purposefully subtle filmmaking creates a perfect blend of drama, terror, and dread.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/take_shelter/|title=Take Shelter|website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|access-date=July 21, 2020}}</ref> The film also has a score of 85 out of 100 on [[Metacritic]], based on 34 reviews, indicating \"universal acclaim\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.metacritic.com/movie/take-shelter|title=Take Shelter|work=[[Metacritic]]|access-date=November 28, 2011}}</ref>\n\n[[Roger Ebert]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' gave the film four out of four stars and praised Shannon's performance, writing, \"It is the gift of actor Michael Shannon as Curtis LaForche that while appearing to be a stable husband and father with a good job in construction, he also can evoke by his eyes and manner a deep unease.\" He also wrote, \"Here is a frightening thriller based not on special effects gimmicks but on a dread that seems quietly spreading in the land: that the good days are ending, and climate changes or other sinister forces will sweep away our safety.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/take-shelter-2011 |title=Take Shelter |last=Ebert |first=Roger |work=Rogerebert.com |publisher=Chicago Sun-Times |date=October 5, 2011 |access-date=July 19, 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Ending===\nSince the release of ''Take Shelter'', viewers have discussed the meaning of the film's ambiguous ending. In an interview with ''Creative Screenwriting'' five years after the release of the film, Nichols reflected, \"I had a very strict idea of what the end of ''Take Shelter'' was. I know exactly what happens, and it\u2019s fascinating to see people respond to it in their own ways. The beautiful part of storytelling is that you\u2019re not just telling people a story, they\u2019re also telling you something about themselves too through their reactions. In that situation you\u2019re in a conversation with your audience. I really can\u2019t think of a more rewarding or fulfilling result for something you\u2019ve written. It\u2019s active, kinetic, and really humbling.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://creativescreenwriting.com/loving/ |title=Emotional Trajectories: Jeff Nichols on Loving |last=McKittrick |first=Christopher |work=CreativeScreenwriting.com |publisher=Creative Screenwriting |date=November 10, 2016 |access-date=November 14, 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn a video interview with Chase Whale in September 2012, Nichols elaborated on the ending, saying \"For me personally...the moment that matters, dream, not dream, real, not real, whatever it is...is these two characters looking at each other and connecting.  The fact that they're both seeing it, that's what matters, because if this is a film that is a meditation on marriage and commitment and communication then what the ending has to be is that these people are on the same page again.  They had this wedge put in between them from all of these various factors, and now at the end they're looking at each other, and they are seeing each other, and they're together, and the circumstances that surround that, please, open to interpretation.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=2KXBfiphgDE |title=Jeff Nichols Discusses Take Shelter's Ending With Chase Whale|website=[[YouTube]] |date=September 9, 2012 |access-date=August 6, 2022}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n\n*[[List of films featuring the deaf and hard of hearing]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Official website}}\n* {{IMDb title}}\n* {{AllMovie title}}\n* {{Rotten Tomatoes}}\n* {{Metacritic film}}\n* {{Mojo title}}\n\n{{Jeff Nichols}}\n\n[[Category:2011 films]]\n[[Category:2011 drama films]]\n[[Category:2011 independent films]]\n[[Category:2010s psychological drama films]]\n[[Category:American drama films]]\n[[Category:American independent films]]\n[[Category:Apocalyptic films]]\n[[Category:2010s English-language films]]\n[[Category:Films about psychiatry]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Jeff Nichols]]\n[[Category:Films set in Ohio]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Ohio]]\n[[Category:Sony Pictures Classics films]]\n[[Category:2010s American films]]"}]}}}}
