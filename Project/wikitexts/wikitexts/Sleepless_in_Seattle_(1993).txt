Ward]] and Jeff Arch. Starring [[Tom Hanks]] and [[Meg Ryan]], the film follows a journalist (Ryan) who, despite being newly engaged, becomes enamored with a recently widowed architect (Hanks), when the latter's son calls in to a [[talk radio]] program requesting a new partner for his grieving father. In addition to [[Bill Pullman]], [[Ross Malinger]], and [[Rob Reiner]], the film features an [[Ensemble cast|ensemble supporting cast]] also consisting of [[Rosie O'Donnell]], [[Gaby Hoffmann|Gaby Hoffman]], [[Victor Garber]], [[Rita Wilson]], [[Barbara Garrick]], and [[Carey Lowell]].\n\nInspired by the romance film ''[[An Affair to Remember]]'' (1957), ''Sleepless in Seattle'' was conceived as a [[Romantic Drama|romantic drama]] by Arch in 1989. Several studios rejected his script, deterred by the idea that its main couple does not meet for nearly the entire film. Arch submitted his script to producer Gary Foster in 1990. Foster strongly believed in the film's potential but struggled to get it made by [[TriStar Pictures]] for several years, finding its emotional script promising but unsophisticated. Ward and Ephron were among several writers hired to re-write the script into a funnier film, with Ephron eventually being promoted to director once [[Nick Castle]] departed over disagreeing with her comedic approach. Although both Hanks and Ryan had been favored for the lead roles from the beginning, several other actors expressed interest in both parts, while Hanks often disagreed with Ephron over his character's material. The film was shot mostly in Seattle during the summer of 1992. Several of its most pivotal scenes were filmed on a former naval base due to the city's lack of sound stages, including a recreation of the Empire State Building's observation deck when the New York skyscraper was not available.\n\n''Sleepless in Seattle'' was released on June 25, 1993, to positive reviews, receiving praise for Ephron's writing and direction, as well as Hanks and Ryan's performances. The film was nominated for two Academy Awards at the 1994 ceremony: Best Original Screenplay and Best Original Song. Despite competition from several blockbusters released around that same summer, the film was a surprise commercial success, earning $17 million during its opening weekend (the highest opening for a romantic comedy at the time), and ultimately grossing over $227&nbsp;million worldwide.<ref name=\"mojo\" /> It was one of the [[1993 in film|highest-grossing films of 1993]], and remains one of the most successful romantic comedies in box office history. The soundtrack was also successful, peaking at number one on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]].\n\nSeveral critics and media publications agree that ''Sleepless in Seattle'' is one of the greatest romantic comedy films of all-time. The film is also credited with establishing Ephron as a celebrated romantic comedy filmmaker.\n\n==Plot==\nChicago architect Sam Baldwin loses his wife Maggie to cancer, and he and their eight-year-old son Jonah start a new life in Seattle, but they continue to mourn. A year later on Christmas Eve, Jonah calls in to a radio talk show and persuades a reluctant Sam to go on the air to talk about how much he misses Maggie. Thousands of women from around the country hear the program and are touched by the story and write to Sam.\n\nOne of the listeners is Annie Reed, a ''[[The Baltimore Sun|Baltimore Sun]]'' reporter who is engaged to Walter, but feels there is something missing from their relationship. After watching the film ''[[An Affair to Remember]]'', Annie writes a letter suggesting that Sam meet her on top of the [[Empire State Building]] on Valentine's Day. She decides not to mail it, but her friend and editor Becky does it for her and later agrees to send Annie to Seattle.\n\nSam begins dating a co-worker, Victoria, whom Jonah dislikes. When Jonah reads Annie's letter addressed to both of them, he instinctively feels that she could 'be the one,' (it mentions the [[Baltimore Orioles]]), but he fails to convince his father to go to New York on Valentine's Day to meet Annie. At the urging of his friend Jessica, Jonah replies to her, agreeing to the New York meeting.\n\nWhile dropping Victoria off at the airport for a flight, Sam sees Annie exiting from her plane and is mesmerized by her, although he has no idea who she is. She later secretly watches Sam and Jonah playing on the beach together. The next day she goes again to Sam's houseboat but when she sees Sam's sister Suzy with him, she mistakenly assumes Suzy is his girlfriend. Sam recognizes Annie from the airport and says \"hello\" but Annie only responds with \"hello\" before leaving. After returning to Baltimore, Annie goes to New York to meet Walter for Valentine's Day.\n\nWith Jessica's help, Jonah flies to New York and goes to the Empire State Building to find Annie. When Sam discovers this, he grabs a later flight to follow him, and he finds Jonah on the observation deck. Meanwhile, Annie sees the skyscraper from the [[Rainbow Room]] where she is dining with Walter and confesses her doubts to him, amicably ending their engagement. She rushes to the Empire State Building and arrives on the observation deck just moments after the doors to the other elevator close with Sam and Jonah inside.\n\nThe observation deck is empty, but Annie discovers Jonah's backpack. As she pulls out his teddy bear from the bag, Sam and Jonah emerge from the elevator to retrieve it, and the three meet. After Sam and Annie stare at each other in recognition, Sam prepares to leave and offers his hand to Annie. A happy Jonah then enters the elevator together with the two as the doors close.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Tom Hanks]] as Sam Baldwin\n* [[Meg Ryan]] as Annie Reed\n* [[Bill Pullman]] as Walter Jackson\n* [[Ross Malinger]] as Jonah Baldwin\t\n* [[Rob Reiner]] as Jay Mathews\n* [[Rosie O'Donnell]] as Becky\n* [[Gaby Hoffmann]] as Jessica\n* [[Victor Garber]] as Greg\n* [[Rita Wilson]] as Suzy\n* [[Barbara Garrick]] as Victoria\n* [[Carey Lowell]] as Maggie Baldwin\n* [[David Hyde Pierce]] as Dennis Reed\n* [[Dana Ivey]] as Claire\n* [[Kevin O'Morrison]] as Cliff Reed\n* [[Caroline Aaron]] as Dr. Marcia Fieldstone\n* [[Frances Conroy]] as Irene Reed\n* [[Calvin Trillin]] as Uncle Milton\n* Le Clanch\u00e9 du Rand as Barbara Reed\n}}\n\n== Production ==\n\n=== Origins and development ===\nIn 1989, ''Sleepless in Seattle'' was conceived by Jeff Arch, a struggling writer and former cinematographer who was working as an [[English studies|English]] and [[taekwondo]] teacher at the time.<ref name=\":3\" /><ref name=\":45\">{{Cite news |last=Kempley |first=Rita |date=June 25, 1993 |title=Movies |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/1993/06/25/movies/dc628e50-87a9-4a1b-9f70-8ede68fc682e/ |access-date=March 21, 2022}}</ref> Recalling that the film was largely conceived out of frustration with his career, Arch had experienced little to no success as a writer prior to ''Sleepless in Seattle'', conceding he simultaneously had little reason to continue writing and little left to lose.<ref name=\":44\" /> Following the birth of his son, Arch convinced himself to write at least three films in one year, the second of which was ''Sleepless in Seattle''.<ref name=\":3\" /> The story began as a play about two people falling in love over the telephone without meeting in person.<ref name=\":44\" /> Struggling to develop an original love story, Arch initially found most of the reasons he conceived to keep the couple apart unconvincing.<ref name=\":44\">{{Cite news |last=Adams |first=Sean |date=November 30, 2018 |title='Sleepless in Seattle' screenwriter and Harrisburg native on the film's 25th anniversary screenings |work=[[The Patriot-News]] |url=https://www.pennlive.com/life-and-culture/erry-2018/11/71b2bd34041075/sleepless-in-seattle-screenwri.html |access-date=March 21, 2022 |id= |quote=But at the time I remember reading an article in the Washington Post about women who were hiring detectives to investigate the men they were dating.

particularly different from ''A League of Their Own'', which had been largely improvisational compared to Ephron's organized directorial style.<ref name=\":25\" /> O'Donnell and Ephron lived in the same apartment building while filming ''Sleepless in Seattle'', which Ephron had obtained for her.<ref name=\":26\" /> Hanks' wife Rita Wilson originally auditioned for the role of Becky, but Ephron preferred her for the role of Sam's sister Suzy, which the director found particularly convenient because Wilson was already in Seattle with her husband.<ref name=\":22\" /> Ephron cast [[Rob Reiner]], who directed ''When Harry Met Sally''..., as Sam's friend in the film, with Reiner contributing to many of the film's laughs.<ref name=\":44\" />\n\nAccording to some of the main cast, Ephron typically insisted that the actors recite their lines almost exactly as-written,<ref name=\":3\" /><ref name=\":24\" /> although Ephron herself said she was open to the cast improvising and re-writing dialogue they felt was unfunny.<ref name=\":34\" /><ref name=\":59\" /><ref name=\":26\" /> Hanks and [[Victor Garber]] improvised the scene in which their characters feign tears while recounting the film ''[[The Dirty Dozen]]'' (1967),<ref name=\":3\" /> mocking Suzy who has been brought to tears by summarizing the plot of ''An Affair to Remember''.<ref name=\":0\" /> Hanks and Ephron agreed that his character was underwritten.<ref name=\":58\" /> Ephron invited the actor to help rewrite his character, which ultimately resulted in \"a grumpier, funnier Sam\".<ref name=\":17\" /> Hanks did not truly commit to the role until he, Ephron and Delia reviewed his character scene by scene, ultimately improving his part.<ref name=\":58\" /> Hanks and Ephron sometimes disagreed over his character's actions, with Hanks accusing the director of making Sam too \"wimpy\" by writing him from a woman's perspective.<ref name=\":17\" /><ref name=\":10\" /> He also complained that better lines had been written for his character's son,<ref name=\":17\" /> and lobbied for Sam and Jonah's relationship to be more paternal than maternal.<ref name=\":26\" /> In the original screenplay, Sam decides not to spend a weekend away with his new girlfriend Victoria in fear of upsetting Jonah.<ref name=\":10\" /> Hanks found this unconvincing for a grown man, suggesting to Ephron that, despite his son's feelings, his character would most likely be absolutely determined to sleep with Victoria after having been single for several years by that point.<ref name=\":6\" /> Ephron re-wrote the scene so Sam only relents once he learns Jonah has stowed away on a plane to New York.<ref name=\":6\" />  Hanks believes the film's drama ultimately benefited from being rooted in logic and \"true, human behaviour\".<ref name=\":10\" /> Arch explained that, despite some resistance from the actor, Hanks ultimately \"rode that boundary, between being a man and having feelings he's able to express\", which was rare for a male character during the 1990s.<ref name=\":44\" /> Ephron described Hanks as \"manly in a part that requires him to be tender -and a lot of other

main setting, the filmmakers only realized how significant the location was upon seeing it for themselves.<ref name=\":8\" /> Arch was inspired to have Sam live in a [[houseboat]] upon watching a Seattle-based episode of ''[[This Old House]]'', which featured host [[Bob Vila]] visiting a similar home.<ref name=\":44\" /> Ephron initially believed that, during the 1990s, young Americans prioritized [[Work\u2013life interface|their careers over their personal lives]].<ref name=\":0\" /> However, upon visiting Seattle, she discovered it as a city where \"people have chosen lifestyle over work\", and decided to set the film there.<ref name=\":0\" /> Ephron explained that this is one of the reasons why Sam moves to Seattle from the work-focused Chicago.<ref name=\":1\" /> Vancouver, British Columbia, which film studios typically use as an affordable Seattle stand-in, was briefly considered an option, but Foster ultimately found the Canadian city to be less diverse than Seattle, hardly distinguishable from other large cities and too Canadian-looking.<ref name=\":8\" /> Principal photography began in July 1992.<ref name=\":7\" /> Once she submitted the final draft in March 1992, Ephron described the film's filming schedule as almost instant, recalling that they were scouting locations in June and filming by August that same year.<ref name=\":9\" /> The film had a production budget of $25 million, with ''The Seattle Times'' reporting that the studio spent approximately $4 million on Seattle-based labor, hotels, meals and local vendors.<ref name=\":8\" /> Foster explained that they decided to primarily use resources local to save money on necessities such as crew, import labor and airfare.<ref name=\":8\" /> Specific Seattle landmarks featured in the film include the [[Pike Place Market]], the [[Sorrento Hotel]], [[Alki Beach Park|Alki Beach]], the [[Fremont Bridge (Seattle)|Fremont Bridge]], [[Seatac Airport|SeaTac Airport]], the [[Dahlia Lounge]], and several [[1st Avenue (Seattle)|1st Avenue]] shops.<ref name=\":8\" />\n\nThe filmmakers could not find a warehouse large enough to host one set, therefore much of the film was shot on the [[Naval Station Puget Sound|Sand Point Naval Base]].<ref name=\":8\" /> Due to the lack of sound stages in Seattle at the time, the filmmakers sought to the base as it was about to be shut down, but received little response from The Federal Bureaucracy until Ephron herself contacted Republican senator [[John Warner]], a former Secretary of the Navy.<ref name=\":3\" /> At times sets and parts of props were shipped between Seattle to Baltimore to ensure sets remained consistent,<ref name=\":0\" /> particularly a door that both Ryan's and Hanks' characters use in separate scenes.<ref name=\":1\" /> Ephron ensured the same door was used to demonstrate the connection between the characters,<ref name=\":2\" /> working with editor Robert M. Reitano to connect their stories via visual parallels, since otherwise the characters hardly share screen time.<ref name=\":34\" /> Because Seattle was experiencing a drought while filming, the filmmakers imported water trucks to simulate the rain scenes.<ref name=\":2\" /> The city was reportedly angry about what they perceived as a waste of water.<ref name=\":9\" /><ref name=\":6\" /> In addition to Seattle, scenes were shot in Chicago, Illinois; Baltimore, Maryland; and New York City.<ref name=\":7\" /> Ironically, Foster deemed a house located on Queen Anne Hill \"Baltimore enough\" to serve as the Baltimore-based home of Annie's parents.<ref name=\":8\" /> Ephron intended for the opening shot of the [[Chicago skyline]] at Maggie Baldwin's funeral to evoke artist [[Saul Steinberg]]'s 1976 ''[[The New Yorker]]'' cover ''[[View of the World from 9th Avenue]]''.<ref name=\":6\" /> A set designer reportedly found working with Ephron so difficult that they begged to be fired from the film.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Tanabe |first=Karin |author-link=Karin Tanabe |date=August 25, 2017 |title='I'll Have What She's Having' explores Ephron's rom-com trifecta |work=[[The Houston Chronicle]] |url=https://www.houstonchronicle.com/entertainment/books/article/I-ll-Have-What-She-s-Having-explores-Ephron-s-11959853.php |access-date=March 18, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170828230839/https://www.houstonchronicle.com/entertainment/books/article/I-ll-Have-What-She-s-Having-explores-Ephron-s-11959853.php |archive-date=August 28, 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe studio was initially denied permission to shoot some of the film's final scenes at the Empire State Building,<ref name=\":2\" /> whose management refused to close the observation deck to tourists to allow filming.<ref name=\":5\" /> Ephron strongly believed that \"you are two phone-calls away from anyone\".<ref name=\":16\" /> Ephron knew the publicist who was representing building owner [[Leona Helmsley]], who was in prison for [[tax evasion]] at the time.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite news |last=King |first=Susan |date=June 25, 2018 |title='Sleepless in Seattle' at 25: Inside the Making of Nora Ephron, Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan's Classic Rom-Com |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |url=https://variety.com/2018/film/news/sleepless-in-seattle-25th-anniversary-meg-ryan-tom-hanks-1202851688/ |access-date=March 14, 2022}}</ref><ref name=\":5\" /> After discussing the matter with her publicist who visited her in jail,<ref name=\":16\" /> Helmsley granted them permission to use the building for only six hours.<ref name=\":2\" /> This allowed them to film the helicopter shot, Annie's lobby scene, and Jonah searching the observation deck for Annie.<ref name=\":3\" /> The observatory of the Empire State Building on which Sam and Annie finally meet during the film's climax was actually a replica built in Hangar 27 of the Sand Point Naval Base, instead of New York City.<ref name=\":8\" /> The building was digitally lit for the film.<ref name=\":44\" /> Ryan was physically uncomfortable while running towards the Empire State Building in order to meet Sam because her shoes were ill-fitting.<ref name=\":33\">{{Cite news |last=Dawn |first=Randee |date=December 5, 2018 |title=Meg Ryan reveals why she loved working with Tom Hanks on 'Sleepless in Seattle' |work=[[Today (American TV program)|Today]] |url=https://www.today.com/today/amp/tdna144279 |access-date=March 17, 2022}}</ref>\n\nThe film's costumes were designed by Judy Ruskin, who designed most of Ryan's wardrobe.<ref name=\":62\">{{Cite news |last=Goodwin |first=Betty |date=June 25, 1993 |title=Simple Clothes, Complex Hairdos |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1993-06-25-vw-7107-story.html |access-date=April 1, 2022}}</ref> Ruskin was careful to dress Ryan in modest, loose-fitting clothes to demonstrate Annie's \"pure heart\", as per Ephron's direction.<ref name=\":62\" /> Ephron hired [[Sven Nykvist]] as the film's cinematographer, as she was instructed to recruit \"the world's best cinematographer\".<ref name=\":59\" /> According to Ephron, he was typically able to light scenes in as little as six minutes.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Lee |first=Chris |date=September 21, 2006 |title=Sven Nykvist, 83;
