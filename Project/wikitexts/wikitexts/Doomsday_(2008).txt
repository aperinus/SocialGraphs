The film takes place in the future in [[Scotland]], which has been quarantined because of a deadly virus. When the virus is found in [[London]], political leaders send a team led by Major Eden Sinclair ([[Rhona Mitra]]) to Scotland to find a possible cure. Sinclair's team runs into two types of survivors: marauders and medieval knights. ''Doomsday'' was conceived by Marshall based on the idea of futuristic soldiers facing medieval knights. In producing the film, he drew inspiration from various movies, including ''[[Mad Max]]'', ''[[Escape from New York]]'' and ''[[28 Days Later]]''.\n\nMarshall had a budget three times the size of his previous two films, ''[[The Descent]]'' and ''[[Dog Soldiers (film)|Dog Soldiers]]'', and the director filmed the larger-scale ''Doomsday'' in Scotland and [[South Africa]]. The film was released in the United States and Canada on 14 March 2008 and in the United Kingdom on 9 May 2008. It received mixed reviews from critics, who praised the casting, pacing, narrative, and homage to previous films, but criticized the plot holes, character development, confusing editing, and overloaded gore. The film grossed $22 million worldwide, making it a [[box-office bomb|box office bomb]].\n\n== Plot ==\nIn 2008, a killer virus, known as the \"Reaper virus\", has been discovered in [[Scotland]], infecting its entire population into becoming hysterical and homicidally insane. Unable to contain the outbreak or cure the infected, the British government builds a massive 30-foot wall that isolated Scotland from the rest of [[Great Britain]]. Whilst the quarantine was deemed a success, the extreme method employed by the government destroys diplomatic and economic relations between the UK and the rest of the world, turning the state itself into a [[pariah state]]. This led to massive unemployment, civil unrest and extreme economic turmoil, causing the UK to collapse into a [[dystopia]].\n\nIn 2035, 27 years after the start of the quarantine, a group of armed police officers discover several people in London infected with Reaper virus during a routine investigation. [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] John Hatcher shares satellite footage of survivors in Scotland with domestic security chief Captain Nelson. Believing a cure may exist, Hatcher orders Nelson to send a team into Scotland to find medical researcher Dr. Kane who was working on a cure when Scotland was quarantined. Nelson chooses his top police officer, Major Eden Sinclair, to lead the team. According to Nelson, Sinclair also hails from Scotland, where she escaped from when the quarantine began at the cost of her right eye. For Sinclair the mission is also personal, as she hopes to learn if her mother survived or not.\n\nSinclair's team crosses the wall to [[Glasgow]], Dr. Kane's last known location. In Glasgow, while searching the local hospital for survivors, Sinclair and her team are ambushed by a group of marauders. Sgt. Norton and Dr. Stirling manage to escape, while the team suffers heavy casualties. Sinclair and Dr. Talbot are captured by what turns out to be a huge gang of brutal cannibals, led by the power-hungry Sol, who plans to use her as leverage to cross the wall, allowing his army to start their [[invasion]] on England. He then leaves for the sacrificial ceremony to join the rest of his gang, who burn Dr. Talbot and eat him alive. With the help of Cally, another prisoner, Sinclair escapes and kills Viper, Sol's second-in-command. She meets with Norton and Stirling, and the three escape on a train. Cally reveals that she and Sol are Kane's children. \n\nMeanwhile, back in London, the increasingly violent riot occurs on the streets. Hatcher plans to evacuate the central London area because of the infection when one of the infected breaks into Hatcher's office and tries to kill him. Nelson shoots and kills the infected man to save Hatcher, but his infected blood suddenly splatters all over the prime minister. As a result to Hatcher's unexpected infection, he is soon quarantined by his right-hand man, Michael Canaris, who also takes his place as ''de facto'' prime minister. Hatcher later commits suicide, knowing that his exposure to the Reaper Virus means an almost-certain death sentence from the virus.\n\nAfter leaving the train, Sinclair's group is spotted and kidnapped by soldiers armed with archaic weapons and armour. They are taken to a medieval castle and imprisoned. Their leader, who is really Marcus Kane, tells Sinclair the truth: there is no cure\u2014only people with a natural immunity. Originally a medical researcher, he was devastated when his family was left behind during the quarantine. After losing his wife, Kane became a twisted, sadistic lord and sentences her and her group to death, pitting Sinclair against Telamon, his executioner, in a small fighting ground to entertain his followers. During the duel, Sinclair subdues and kills Telamon while the rest of the group escapes, retrieving their equipment and rescuing Sinclair.\n\nSinclair, Norton, Stirling and Cally escape to a fallout shelter entrance on horseback. They locate an underground facility in the forest and find an intact [[Bentley Continental GT|2007 Bentley Continental GT]]. Kane's medieval knights arrive and kill Norton. Sinclair and the others drive the Bentley back to the quarantine wall. On the way, they are intercepted by Sol's gang, who seeks to avenge Viper once and for all. After a high-speed chase, Sol and many of his men are killed and Sinclair's group escape.\n\nUsing a phone retrieved from the fallout shelter, Sinclair calls Canaris, who later arrives in a government gunship. Canaris then tricks Sinclair into trading Cally to develop a vaccine, revealing himself as the creator of the Reaper virus, which is, in fact, a bioweapon that can spread all over the UK as both a form of population control and shady profit.\n\nCally and Stirling board the gunship with Canaris while Sinclair returns to her old house in search of her mother, followed by Nelson, who flew into the quarantine zone to speak with her. While Sinclair learns that her mother perished during the quarantine, she is able to retrieve a picture of her. Sinclair gives Nelson a recording of Canaris' scheme to take over the UK, the evidence that would save everyone from this state-wide pandemic once and for all. The recording is later broadcast to the rest of the country, much to Canaris' dismay as it spells doom to his career and subsequential criminal conviction.\n\nMeanwhile, Sinclair retrieves Sol's head and returns it to his gang; she throws the head onto the ground, announcing to the marauders, \u201cIf you're hungry, try a piece of your friend\u201d. The marauders stand in shock for a moment of stunned silence before bursting into cheering, accepting Sinclair as their new leader.\n\n== Cast ==\n[[File:Rhona Mitra (Straighten Colors).jpg|thumb|upright|alt=A seated woman with brown hair extending below her shoulders and wearing a blue shirt smiles as she looks to her right.|Actress Rhona Mitra starred in ''Doomsday'' as Major Eden Sinclair.]]\n* [[Rhona Mitra]] as Eden Sinclair, a Major of the Department of Domestic Security, selected to lead a team to find a cure.<ref name=mitra/> The heroine was inspired by the character [[Snake Plissken]].<ref name=hot>{{cite news | first=Justine | last=Elias | url=https://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/tv-movies/hot-heroines-apocalyptic-flicks-article-1.247981 | title=Hot heroines in apocalyptic flicks | work=[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]] | date=30 September 2007 | access-date=31 December 2021}}</ref> Mitra worked out and fight trained for eleven weeks for the film.

The director fantasised about what conditions would cause the Wall to be rebuilt and imagined a lethal virus would work. Marshall had also visualised a mixture of medieval and futuristic elements: \"I had this vision of these futuristic soldiers with high-tech weaponry and body armour and helmets\u2014clearly from the future\u2014facing a medieval knight on horseback.\" The director favoured the English/Scottish border as the location for a rebuilt wall, finding the location more plausible than a lengthy boundary between the United States and Canada. Additionally, Scotland is the home to multiple castles, which fit Marshall's medieval aspect.<ref name=cfq>{{cite news| first= Steve| last= Biodrowski | title= Interview: Neil Marshall Directs \"Doomsday\"| publisher= Cinefantastique.com | url= http://cinefantastiqueonline.com/2008/03/07/interview-neil-marshall-directs-doomsday |url-status= dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080309212354/http://cinefantastiqueonline.com/2008/03/07/interview-neil-marshall-directs-doomsday/ |archive-date= 2008-03-09 |access-date= 10 April 2020 }}</ref>\n\nThe lethal virus in ''Doomsday'' differs from contemporary films like ''[[28 Days Later]]'' and ''[[28 Weeks Later]]'' by being an authentic plague that actually devastates the population, instead of infecting people so they become aggressive cannibals or zombies. Marshall intended the virus as the backdrop to the story, having survivors scavenge for themselves and set up a primitive society. The director drew from tribal history around the world to design the society. Though the survivors are depicted as brutal, Marshall sought to have \"shades of gray\" by characterising some people in England as selfishly manipulative.<ref name=\"cfq\"/>\n\nThe director intended ''Doomsday'' as a tribute to post-apocalyptic films from the 1970s and 1980s, explaining, \"Right from the start, I wanted my film to be an homage to these sorts of movies, and deliberately so. I wanted to make a movie for a new generation of audience that hadn't seen those movies in the cinema\u2014hadn't seen them at all maybe\u2014and to give them the same thrill that I got from watching them.

While filmmakers did not seek innovative visual effects, they worked with budget restrictions by creating set extensions. With most shots taking place in daylight, the extensions involved [[Matte painting|matte paint]] and 2D and 3D solutions. The visual effects crew visited Scotland to take reference photos so scenes that were filmed in Cape Town, South Africa could instead have Scottish backgrounds. Several challenges for the visual effects crew included the illustration of cow overpopulation in line with a decimated human population and the convincing creation of the rebuilt Hadrian Wall in different lights and from different distances. The most challenging visual effects shot in ''Doomsday'' was the close-up in which a main character is burned alive. The shot required multiple enhancements and implementations of burning wardrobe, burning pigskin, and smoke and fire elements to look authentic.<ref name=vfxworld>{{cite news | first=Thomas J. | last=McLean | url=http://www.vfxworld.com/?atype=articles&format=rss&id=3578 | title=''Doomsday'': A VFX Cure for the Reaper Virus | publisher=VFXWorld.com | date=14 March 2008 | access-date=20 May 2008 }}</ref>\n\nNeil Marshall's car chase sequence also involved the use of visual effects. A scene in which the Bentley crashes through a bus was intended to implement pyrotechnics, but fire marshals in the South African nature reserve, the filming location for the scene, forbade their use due to dry conditions. A miniature mock-up was created and visual effects were applied so the filming of the mock-up would overlay the filming of the actual scene without pyrotechnics. Other visual effects that were created were the Thames flood plain and a remote Scottish castle. A popular effect with the visual effects crew was the \"rabbit explosion\" scene, depicting a rabbit being shot by guns on automatic sensors. The crew sought to expand the singular shot, but Neil Marshall sought to focus on one shot to emphasise its comic nature and avoid drawing unnecessary sympathy from audiences.<ref name=vfxworld/>\n\n=== Music ===\nMarshall originally intended to include 1980s [[synthesizer|synth]] music in his film, but he found it difficult to combine the music with the intense action. Instead, composer [[Tyler Bates]] composed a score using heavy orchestra music.<ref name=sayer/> The film also included songs from the bands [[Adam and the Ants]], [[Fine Young Cannibals]], [[Siouxsie and the Banshees]], [[Frankie Goes to Hollywood]], and [[Kasabian]].<ref name=credits/> The song \"[[Two Tribes]]\" by Frankie Goes to Hollywood was the only song to remain in the film from the first draft of the screenplay. \"[[Spellbound (Siouxsie and the Banshees song)|Spellbound]]\" by Siouxsie and the Banshees was a favourite song of the director, who sought to include it. Marshall also hoped to include the song \"Into the Light\" by the Banshees, but it was left out due to the producer disliking it and the cost being too high to license it.<ref>{{cite news | first=Tim| last=Masters| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/7390688.stm| title= Talking Shop: Neil Marshall| work=[[BBC News]]| date=9 May 2008| access-date=20 May 2008 }}</ref>\n\n== Release ==\n=== Theatrical run ===\nFor its theatrical run, the film was originally intended to be distributed by [[Focus Features]] under [[Rogue Pictures]], but the company transferred ''Doomsday'' among other films to [[Universal Studios|Universal Pictures]] for larger-scale distribution and marketing beginning in 2008.<ref>{{cite journal | first=Dade | last=Hayes | url= https://variety.com/2007/film/markets-festivals/rogue-marketing-moves-to-universal-1117974078/ | title=Rogue marketing moves to Universal | journal=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date=15 October 2007 | access-date=24 December 2007 }}</ref> ''Doomsday'' was commercially released on 14 March 2008 in the United States and Canada in 1,936 theatres, grossing US$4,926,565 in its opening weekend and ranking seventh in the box office,<ref name=bom>{{cite web | url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=doomsday.htm | title=Doomsday (2008) | work=[[Box Office Mojo]] | publisher=Box Office Mojo, LLC | access-date=3 July 2008 }}</ref> which ''[[Box Office Mojo]]'' reported as a \"failed\" opening.<ref>{{cite news | first=Brandon | last=Gray | url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/news/?id=2465&p=.htm | title='Horton' Hits It Big | work=[[Box Office Mojo]] | publisher=Box Office Mojo, LLC | date=17 March 2008 | access-date=3 July 2008 }}</ref> Its theatrical run in the United States and Canada lasted 28 days, ending on 10 April 2008, having grossed US$11,463,861.<ref name=bom/> The film opened in the United Kingdom, [[Republic of Ireland]], and [[Malta]] on 9 May 2008, grossing a total of US$2,061,794 in its entire run.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/release/rl4288054785/weekend | title=Doomsday (2008) - United Kingdom Box Office Results | work=[[Box Office Mojo]] | publisher=Box Office Mojo, LLC | access-date=8 April 2021 }}</ref> The film's performance in the UK was considered a \"disappointing run\".<ref name=tanks>{{cite news | first=Orlando | last=Parfitt | url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/speed_racer/news/1728059/uk_box_office_breakdown_speed_racer_tanks | title=UK Box Office Breakdown: Speed Racer Tanks | work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] | date=14 May 2008 | access-date=3 July 2008 }}</ref> The film premiered in Italy in August 2008, grossing an overall US$500,000.<ref>{{cite journal|first=Frank |last=Segers |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/film/news/e3i70662f7dd9d6f3c434b1463dc499d597 |title='Knight' tops overseas with $19 mil |journal=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |publisher=[[Nielsen Company]] |date=31 August 2008 |access-date=13 October 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080913082644/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/film/news/e3i70662f7dd9d6f3c434b1463dc499d597 |archive-date=13 September 2008 }}</ref> Worldwide, ''Doomsday'' has grossed US$22,472,631.<ref name=bom/>\n\n{{Anchor|Reception|Critical reception|Critics}}\n\n=== Critical response ===\n{{Quote box\n | quote = \"The director of top horror flicks ''The Descent'' and ''Dog Soldiers'' was given more money for his latest effort, but many thought he wasted it on a collection of flashy set pieces without much interlinking plot in between.\"\n | source = [[Rotten Tomatoes]] on UK's general consensus<ref name=tanks/>\n | width = 300px\n | align = right\n}}\n''Doomsday'' was not screened for critics in advance of its commercial opening in cinemas.<ref>{{cite news | first=Larry | last=Ratliff | title=Latest virus film put in quarantine | work=[[San Antonio Express-News]] | date=14 March 2008 }}</ref> On [[Rotten Tomatoes]] the film has an approval rating of 51% based on reviews from 72 critics, with an average rating of 5.23/10.
