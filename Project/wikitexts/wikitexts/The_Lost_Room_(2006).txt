The series revolves around the titular room and some of the everyday items from that room which possess unusual powers. The show's protagonist, Joe Miller, is searching for these objects to rescue his daughter, Anna, who has disappeared inside the Room. Once a typical room at a 1960s [[motel]] along [[U.S. Route 66]], the Lost Room has existed outside of normal time and space since 1961, when what is referred to only as \"the Event\" took place.\n\n== Cast and characters ==\n* [[Peter Krause]] as Detective Joe Miller \u2013 A [[Pittsburgh]] detective who stumbles upon the existence of the Room.

He resides in a sanitarium under the name \"[[John Doe]]\" until found by Joe.  Like the objects, he does not age, and cannot be damaged (hurt) in any way, so he himself is essentially one of the objects.\n* [[Jorge Pallo]] as Ignacio \"Iggy\" Loca \u2013 Survivor of the pawn shop murders, temporarily holder of the Key, hands it to Detective Miller when dying.\n\n== Plot ==\n\n=== The Room ===\nThe Room is the now nonexistent Room 10 at the abandoned Sunshine Motel outside [[Gallup, New Mexico]]. At 1:20:44&nbsp;p.m. on May 4, 1961, something happened at the site of the Room that erased it and all its contents. This is referred to as \"the Event\" or \"the Incident\", and is thought to be the reason for the unusual properties of the Room and the Objects from within it. At the time of the Event, the motel was in serviceable condition, but after the event nobody remembers that a tenth room ever existed. One of the Objects, the undeveloped [[Instant camera|Polaroid]] picture, allows a person to view the tenth room as it was at the time of the Event by standing at its now vacant location at the Sunshine Motel ruins.\n\nThe Room can be accessed only by the person who has the Key. The Key will open any hinged door with a [[pin tumbler lock]] anywhere in the world, turning that door into a portal accessing the Room regardless of where it would normally open into. As Joe Miller sees on the surveillance tape, when a door is opened using the key, it appears closed if viewed from the other side of that door. When exiting the Room, its door opens not necessarily to the original place of entry, but to any room the holder of the Key has in mind, or to a random room if the user does not focus. To reach a specific room the user must have a clear picture of the room's door and the area around it. The \"Lost\" Room thus serves as a means of instant travel between similar doors anywhere on Earth.  Hinged doors with types of locks other than a tumbler lock or with no lock at all, sliding doors and rotating doors cannot be used to access the Room.  The door used does not have to be installed in a wall and can be a smaller prop door or a freestanding doorway; the only important elements are the lock and that it be a hinged door.\n\nAny time the door is closed with the key outside the room, the Room \"resets\": everything that is not an Object disappears, including people. Multiple people can enter the room at once, but they must exit the room when the Key does.  When the Room resets, any Objects in the Room will return to their original position at the time of the Event.  A benefit of this is that an Object enclosed within something else, such as a safe, may be retrieved by leaving it inside and resetting the room.  This can also be used to distinguish real Objects from fakes, since fakes will disappear.\n\nObjects, when outside the Room, possess special powers and are indestructible. When inside the Room, Objects lose their special properties and can be destroyed.  According to the Occupant, a new Object will take the destroyed Object's place, a phenomenon he refers to as the [[Conservation law (physics)|Law of Conservation]] of Objects.  The Occupant states that there are many Rooms, and so any non-Object left in the Room is not erased, but exists in a different instance of the Room. The reset, in turn, represents a confluence of these Rooms, allowing the Occupant (the only Object with consciousness) to retrieve things lost during a reset, provided he has a clear idea of what he wishes to retrieve.\n\n=== The Event ===\nThe Event is a shorthand term given to the moment in time that the Lost Room was created. It occurred at 1:20:44&nbsp;p.m. on May 4, 1961, and erased the room and all of its contents from history. The reason behind this and the ultimate purpose of the Objects is unknown, though two primary hypotheses have been postulated. Even the man occupying the room at the time of the event doesn't seem to know what happened, so the truth remains a mystery. Both hypotheses essentially lead to the same conclusion, but attribute the event to different causes.\n\nOne faction, the Order of the Reunification, operates under the belief that the Objects are pieces of God's mind or body, and that reuniting them will allow them to communicate with God. More extreme versions of this view hold that reuniting the Objects will turn one into God or at least give that person God-like powers. Martin Ruber purports that the Occupant confirmed this particular theory for him in a vision, making him the self-proclaimed \"Prophet of the Objects\", but his near-death state from dehydration and heat exhaustion at the time casts doubt on his claims.  Additionally, the Occupant himself shows no knowledge of the circumstances behind the event.  The Deck of Cards, which gives one who is exposed to it a vision of the events during the Collectors' failed attempt to use the objects on Room 9 of the hotel, may be the source of their beliefs, as it is used in their rituals.\n\nAnother (though not necessarily contradictory) view of the phenomenon suggests that reality was somehow shattered at the location of the Room, thus separating it and everything in it from time and giving its contents metaphysical abilities.  Should the items be collected and returned to the room by an individual, that person would then have complete control over reality. This theory works under the assumption that the one gathering the objects has the knowledge to utilize them properly. Since the Objects are just considered tools, they would do no good if the user were unaware of their paranormal functions.\n\n=== The Objects ===\nThe Objects are [[Magic item|powerful artifacts]] and consist of roughly 100 everyday items one would expect to find in an occupied motel room in the 1960s. They are indestructible (except when inside the Room) and possess various other-worldly powers when taken outside the Lost Room, but do not work within the Room itself. According to the Occupant (Eddie McCleister), when an object is destroyed within the room, another object takes its place. Whether the new object takes the former's properties partially or totally is unknown. Various characters repeatedly put forth the opinion that, over time, Objects lead to something akin to bad [[karma]] or bad luck for their owners. All of the items (including the occupant) attract one another, wanting to come together. The Occupant states that the objects are aware of each other, constantly sending out pings to each other and that for a living mind this is torture; the Occupant was eventually found when a search of the recorded history of other Objects revealed a small circular area where the Objects had never been detected, representing the area where the Occupant had resided for years.\n\n=== The Cabals ===\nMany Object-seekers have organized themselves into groups, known as \"[[cabal]]s\". Wars between cabals are mentioned in the series. There are at least three cabals:\n\n; The Collectors : The original group of Object-seekers formed some time after the Event.  Led by Arlene Conroy, the manager of the Sunshine Motel, most of the Collectors were killed or driven insane after the disaster in Room 9 in 1966.  The survivors hid their most important Objects in a place called \"The Collector's Vault\", buried in a fallout shelter beneath an abandoned prison.\n; The Legion : A cabal dedicated to collecting the Objects and stopping them from causing more harm.  They claim to follow an established set of rules, including that they never kill in order to acquire the Objects, although this rule is sometimes put to the test.\n; The Order of the Reunification : Also referred to as \"The Order\" or \"The New Religion\".  They believe that the Objects are pieces of God and must be reunited.  Once so restored, members of the Order would be able to communicate with God for the first time in human history.  Unlike the Legion, The Order have no qualms about killing.\n\n== Episodes ==\n{{Episode table |background=#471317 |overall= |title= |director= |writer= |airdate= |episodes=\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 1\n |Title = The Key and the Clock\n |DirectedBy = [[Craig R.
