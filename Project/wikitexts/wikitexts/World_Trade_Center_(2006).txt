It stars [[Nicolas Cage]], [[Maria Bello]], [[Michael Pe\u00f1a]], [[Maggie Gyllenhaal]], [[Stephen Dorff]], and [[Michael Shannon]]. The film was shot between October 2005 and February 2006, and theatrically released in the United States on August 9, 2006. The film was met with generally positive reviews from critics and grossed $163 million worldwide.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- WP:FILMPLOT recommends the plot summary to be between 400-700 words. -->\nOn September 11, 2001, members of the [[Port Authority of New York and New Jersey Police Department|Port Authority Police]] are dispatched to [[Downtown Manhattan]] in response to the [[List of tenants in One World Trade Center|North Tower]] of the [[World Trade Center (1973\u20132001)|World Trade Center]] having been [[American Airlines Flight 11|hit by a plane]]. The officers learn en route that the [[List of tenants in Two World Trade Center|South Tower]] also was [[United Airlines Flight 175|hit by another plane]]. Sergeant [[John McLoughlin (police officer)|John McLoughlin]], veteran of the [[1993 World Trade Center bombing|1993 bombing]], assembles a group of volunteers; officers Antonio Rodrigues, [[Will Jimeno]] and [[Dominick Pezzulo]], to retrieve rescue equipment from [[5 World Trade Center#Original building (1970\u20132001)|Building 5]]. They are joined by Officer Christopher Amoroso.\n\nAs the five officers prepare to enter the North Tower from the concourse, the South Tower begins to [[Collapse of the World Trade Center|collapse]] onto them, and McLoughlin realizes that their only chance of survival is to take shelter in the elevator shaft. McLoughlin, Jimeno, and Pezzulo are the only survivors, but they are trapped beneath the rubble. Pezzulo tries but fails to free Jimeno, whose lower half is pinned. McLoughlin, who is also pinned, listens helplessly as the North Tower begins to collapse. Pezzulo is fatally injured when a concrete slab crushes his torso, but manages to fire his sidearm once into the air, in an attempt to alert rescuers to their whereabouts just before dying. Jimeno and McLoughlin spend painful, terrifying hours under the rubble telling each other about their lives. Meanwhile, their families try to learn if they are still alive.\n\nWhen [[7 World Trade Center|Building 7]] collapses, both men scream and accept their demise, but they survive without further harm. McLoughlin tries to keep Jimeno awake by encouraging him to repeatedly pull on a metal pipe that potential rescuers might hear. Hours pass, and McLoughlin falls in and out of consciousness. Both agree to stay alive for one another.\n\nTwo [[United States Marines]], [[Dave Karnes]] and [[Jason Thomas (Marine)|Jason Thomas]], who are searching for survivors, hear the noise produced by Jimeno and find the men, calling for help to dig them out. After hours and effort by [[first responders]], Jimeno is rescued first, and then hours later McLoughlin is lifted out of the debris in critical condition. Both men are reunited with their families at the hospital and undergo medical treatment, including extensive surgeries, and McLoughlin is placed in a [[medically induced coma]].\n\nIn 2003, Jimeno and McLoughlin, both medically retired from duty, attend a celebratory barbecue with their families. The [[epilogue]] reveals that both men were two of twenty people found alive at Ground Zero, and they were numbers eighteen and nineteen, respectively. David Karnes reenlisted in the Marines and served two tours in the [[Iraq War]].\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Nicolas Cage]] as Sergeant [[John McLoughlin (police officer)|John McLoughlin]]\n* [[Michael Pe\u00f1a]] as Officer [[Will Jimeno]]\n* [[Maria Bello]] as Donna McLoughlin\n* [[Maggie Gyllenhaal]] as Allison Jimeno\n* [[Stephen Dorff]] as NYPD [[New York City Police Department Emergency Service Unit|ESU Rescueman]] Scott Strauss\n* [[Jon Bernthal]] as Officer Christopher Amoroso\n* [[Jay Hernandez]] as Officer [[Dominick Pezzulo]]\n* [[Michael Shannon]] as [[Dave Karnes|Marine Sergeant Dave Karnes]]\n* [[Donna Murphy]] as Judy Jonas\n* [[Brad William Henke]] as Allison's Brother\n* [[Peter McRobbie]] as Allison's Father\n* [[Frank Whaley]] as [[Paramedic]] Chuck Sereika\n* [[Jude Ciccolella]] as Inspector Lawrence Fields\n* [[Nicholas Turturro]] as Officer Colovito\n* [[Danny Nucci]] as Officer Giraldi\n* [[William Mapother]] as [[Jason Thomas (Marine)|Marine Sergeant Jason Thomas]]\n* Wass Stevens as Officer Pat McLoughlin\n* [[Armando Riesco]] as Officer Antonio Rodrigues\n* [[Ned Eisenberg]] as Officer Polnicki\n* [[Dara Coleman]] as Officer Boel\n* [[Nick Damici]] as Lieutenant John Kassimatis\n* [[Arthur Nascarella]] as FDNY Chief At Ground Zero\n* [[Patti D'Arbanville]] as Donna's Friend\n* [[Viola Davis]] as Mother In Hospital\n* Will Jimeno as Port Authority Police Officer\n* [[Aimee Mullins]] as Reporter\n* [[Charles A.
