It is based on the nonfictional story of [[Vince Papale]] ([[Mark Wahlberg]]), who played for the [[Philadelphia Eagles]] from [[1976 NFL season|1976]] to [[1978 NFL season|1978]] with the help of his coach, [[Dick Vermeil]] ([[Greg Kinnear]]). The film was released in the United States on August 25, 2006.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for featured film articles should be 400-700 words. -->\nIn the 1970s, [[Philadelphia]] is in chaos as southern portions of the city protest the shutdown of several job sites while their NFL team, the [[Philadelphia Eagles]], endures a string of losing seasons. In 1976, a 30 year old substitute teacher [[Vince Papale]] goes to a sandlot one night and joins his friends playing a [[pick-up game|pick-up]] football game against another group of young men. After the game ends, Papale goes home and finds his wife Sharon disgusted with his failure to provide proper support.\n\nThe next morning, Papale is unexpectedly laid off from his job at the school. That night, Papale goes to the bar where he works as a part-time [[bartender]]. The bar contains die-hard Eagles fans, who are watching a TV report on Eagles hiring a new head coach, [[Dick Vermeil]], who will be staging open public tryouts for the Eagles; the bar regulars encourage Papale to attend the tryout. Returning home, Papale finds out that Sharon has left him, leaving him a note saying he will never be anything in the world. Distraught, Papale trashes the few remaining belongings that she left behind.\n\nThe next night at the bar, Papale meets a new co-bartender, Janet Cantrell, who is a [[New York Giants|Giants]] fan. Desperate for income in the aftermath of his wife's departure, Papale receives support from his friends and attends the tryout hosted at [[Veterans Stadium]]. Papale is competing against several hundred Philadelphia residents, but performs well during the workouts. After the tryouts, Dick Vermeil comes by as Papale is trying to start his car. Vermeil is impressed by Papale's performance and invites him to training camp to compete for a roster spot with the Eagles. Accepting, Papale receives a warm welcome at the bar, and has an interview with a newscaster.\n\nThe next day, Papale is jogging in the city and stops by his empty home; running into friends, he tells them about joining the Eagles. His father, meanwhile, offers to let Vince stay with him. The following day, he goes to his first training camp with the Eagles. As the days of training camp progress, Papale endures hard training and disrespect from other players. One night, Papale takes Janet out on a date. He is unsure if he can start a new relationship, since he needs to try his best to make the team. Janet claims that she did not know it was a date. She goes back to work and he leaves. As training camp ends, the final roster spot is down to Papale and a veteran. Against his assistants' advice, Vermeil hands the final spot to Papale.\n\nAs Papale's career with the Eagles begins, the team loses all six preseason games and their regular season opener against the [[Dallas Cowboys]]. Papale plays poorly against the Cowboys, and Vermeil faces pressure from the fans and media. After the team returns to Philadelphia, Papale goes to the sandlot where he played with his friends once before. He is invited to play, but he declines because of his upcoming Eagles game and watches for a few minutes. However, as a rainstorm begins, Papale joins his pals and plays against another sandlot team to help his friends. He ends the wet and dirty game by throwing a touchdown pass. When he runs into Janet later, they speak briefly before passionately embracing and tumbling into Papale's home.\n\nDuring the home opener against the New York Giants, Janet's appearance in a Giants shirt angers the Eagles fans. In the locker room, Papale looks again at the note Sharon had left and tears it up. He opens the game by solo-tackling the kickoff returner inside the fifteen-yard line. After an up-and-down game, Papale gets downfield during an Eagles' fourth quarter punt to tackle the returner, forcing a fumble that he recovers and takes into the end zone for a touchdown, giving the Eagles their first win in Papale's career. Eagles fans go wild with joy. During the end credits, media highlights of Papale's career with the Eagles are shown. Papale plays for the team for three seasons and eventually marries Janet while Vermeil succeeds in turning the Eagles into a winning team, culminating in an appearance in [[Super Bowl XV]].\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Mark Wahlberg]] as [[Vince Papale]]\n* [[Greg Kinnear]] as [[Dick Vermeil]]\n* [[Elizabeth Banks]] as Janet Cantrell\n* [[Kevin Conway (actor)|Kevin Conway]] as Frank Papale\n* [[Michael Rispoli]] as Max Cantrell\n* [[Kirk Acevedo]] as Tommy\n* [[Dov Davidoff]] as Johnny\n* [[Michael Kelly (American actor)|Michael Kelly]] as Pete\n* [[Stink Fisher]] as [[Dennis Franks|Dennis \"Denny\" Franks]]\n* [[Michael Mulheren]] as AC Craney\n* [[Michael Nouri]] as [[Leonard Tose]]\n* [[Lola Glaudini]] as Sharon Papale\n* [[Paige Turco]] as Carol Vermeil\n* [[Randy Couture]] as \"Toruci\" Player #1\n\n==Differences from the true story==\nIn reality, Papale started playing football in the Delaware County Rough Touch League (PA) in the late 60's before his semi-professional and pro football experience. He then played with the [[Semi-professional|semi-pro]] Aston Green Knights of the [[Seaboard Football League]] and two seasons with the [[Philadelphia Bell]] of the [[World Football League]], one of the [[NFL]]'s rival leagues on the level of the [[American Football League|AFL]] and the [[USFL]]. Papale was a standout [[special teams]] star for the Bell, who played at Philadelphia's [[JFK Stadium]].<ref name=\"Unembellished\">{{cite web|last1=Quackenbush|first1=Eric|title=The Unembellished Story of Vince Papale|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/124531-the-unembellished-story-of-vince-papale|website=Bleacher Report|access-date=10 September 2017|date=15 February 2009}}</ref>\n\nMark Wahlberg was shorter (5'8\") than Vince Papale, who stood at 6'2\" while playing for the Eagles.

In real life, Papale dated and married his second wife, Sandy during the movie's time frame. He was divorced and met Janet after his Eagles career as the couple married in 1993.<ref name=\"RockyStart\">{{cite news|last1=Jones|first1=Robert F.|title=RECOVERING FROM A ROCKY START|url=https://www.si.com/vault/1977/10/03/626759/recovering-from-a-rocky-start|access-date=10 September 2017|work=Sports Illustrated|date=3 October 1977|format=Vault|quote=When Rocky Balboa got his chance, he lost the fight.

For the Eagles, Papale actually participated in a private workout that was by invitation only.<ref name=\"Unembellished\"/>\n\nThe opening scene of the movie features the Eagles' 31\u22120 loss to the [[Cincinnati Bengals]] on December 7, 1975. One of the fans makes a comment that the Eagles lost to a team worse than they were. In 1975, the Bengals actually went 11\u20133 and were the [[Wild card (sports)|wild card]] team in the [[American Football Conference|AFC]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/cin/1975.htm |title=1975 Cincinnati Bengals Statistics & Players |publisher=Pro-Football-Reference.com |access-date=April 12, 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe game versus the New York Giants is depicted as being a close defensive struggle, with the Giants scoring first to take a 7\u20130 lead. The Eagles actually won easily, 20\u20137, with the Giants not scoring until late in the game. The fumble recovery depicted in the climactic scene did occur, but Papale's touchdown did not count, under NFL rules at the time, since the ball could not be advanced. It was still a key play in the victory for the Eagles.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2006-08-25/sports/0608250072_1_papale-ravens-invincible|title=Perfectly familiar story|work=[[The Baltimore Sun]]|date= August 25, 2006|first1=Bill|last1=Ordine|access-date=September 4, 2012}}</ref> Papale never scored a regular-season touchdown in the NFL. His only offensive stat came in the 1977 season, where he had 1 catch for 15 yards. However, he scored his first NFL touchdown against the Patriots in a 1977 exhibition game. As with so many of his breaks, this was a big one\u2014the game-winning score. Rookie Quarterback Mike Cordova threw from the Pats' 14, and Cornerback Raymond Clayborn deflected the ball slightly allowing Papale to make a diving catch in the end zone.<ref name=\"RockyStart\"/><ref name=\"NFLStats\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nfl.com/player/vincepapale/2522709/careerstats|title=Vince Papale: Career Stats|work=NFL.com|access-date=September 4, 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Filming==\n\nThe preseason/tryout scenes were filmed at [[Franklin Field]] at the [[University of Pennsylvania]], and the [[Central High School (Philadelphia, Pennsylvania)|Central High School]] Lancers field during July and August 2005. (For 13 seasons, [[1958 NFL season|1958]]\u2013[[1970 NFL season|1970]], Franklin Field was the home field of the Eagles.) The crew used their locker room and field. The Lancers, who had a preseason, used [[Fairmount Park]] in [[West Philadelphia]] during this time. The office scenes were filmed in Delaplaine McDaniel Middle School, during renovations to the school at 1801 Moore Street [[South Philadelphia]]. The carnival scenes were filmed at Our Lady of Mount Carmel School in [[South Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|South Philadelphia]] at 2329 South Third Street. Some of the street scenes were filmed on location in the city. The remainder of the film was filmed in a former aircraft carrier parts warehouse on Langley Avenue in the Philadelphia Naval Business Center. The crew shared this facility with the floats for the Philadelphia Thanksgiving Day Parade.<ref name=\"StoryNotes\">{{cite web|title=Story Notes for Invincible|url=http://www.amc.com/talk/2014/02/story-notes-for-invincible|website=AMC.com|date=2013}}</ref> The film opens with [[Jim Croce]]'s [[I Got a Name (song)|\"I Got a Name\"]].\n\n==Box office==\nIn opening weekend the movie made approximately $17,031,122 domestically.
