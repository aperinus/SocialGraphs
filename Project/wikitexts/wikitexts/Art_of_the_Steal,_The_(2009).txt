The move was disputed because Dr. [[Albert C. Barnes]], who died in 1951, had specifically selected [[Lower Merion Township]] for its location. The collection was moved in 2012 to [[Philadelphia]].<ref>{{cite magazine\n|url=http://www.vanityfair.com/online/daily/2010/03/the-art-of-stealing-from-the-rich-and-dead.html\n|title=The Art of Stealing from the Rich and Dead|magazine=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]\n|date=March 2, 2010|access-date=March 12, 2010}}</ref> The film presents an account of the claimed breaking of Barnes's will, which it presents as a decades-long process that was initiated by Philadelphians who were enemies of Barnes while he was alive, and that was continued by their heirs.\n\n==Subject and making of the film==\nThe will of Dr. Barnes established the Foundation with strict rules against ever moving the collection or any of its paintings away from its location, and to serve primarily as a school for the teaching of art, art criticism, and art appreciation, and not primarily as a museum for the general public. The people who supported the move argued that the collection should instead become a major tourist attraction for Philadelphia. The supporters of Merion claimed that the Philadelphians were less interested in Dr. Barnes's will than in enhancing their power by taking over the control of a $25+ billion asset.\n\nThe collection was located in a residential neighborhood about five miles from Philadelphia. Because of the constant efforts by the Philadelphia aristocracy to seize the collection, the [[Pennsylvania|Commonwealth of Pennsylvania]] refrained from contributing funds to make its endowment sufficient, but secretly arranged to provide $100 million of taxpayer funds only once the control of the Foundation was taken over by the new board.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} The new president and officers of the board succeeded in challenging the will to enable it to send some pieces on tour to earn enough money for needed renovations to the facility to preserve the artwork and provide security. But little went to the upkeep of the facility, because the funds were drained away by the legal contest of the will.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}\n\nThe 9,000-piece collection of mostly late-19th- and early-20th-century art includes 181 [[Renoir]]s, 69 [[C\u00e9zanne]]s, 60 [[Matisse]]s, 44 [[Picasso]]s, and 14 [[Amedeo Modigliani|Modiglianis]]. What makes the collection extraordinary is not just the artists, but that Dr. Barnes acquired so many of the very best works of each of those masters. The extraordinarily high overall quality of the works is the chief special attribute of the collection.\n\nWhile the film includes journalists, art historians and public figures on both sides of the long debate, many of the figures discussed in it, such as [[Rebecca Rimel]] (CEO of the [[Pew Charitable Trusts]], the group which purportedly benefited financially from the Barnes's move); [[Raymond G. Perelman]] (a powerful local billionaire alleged to have orchestrated the move); and Bernard C. Watson (the president of the Barnes Foundation, who was accused of giving over its control to the Philadelphia authorities) declined to be interviewed for the documentary.\n\n==Reception and distribution==\nThe film was met with mixed and emotional reactions when it was shown at the [[New York Film Festival]]. Director Don Argott described the Q&A session that followed the film: \"People were yelling, screaming at each other. These issues bring out these emotions. I'm not sure why. But for some reason the Barnes stirs something up in people.\"<ref name=\"Requiem for a Jumble of Artworks\">{{cite news|title=Requiem for a Jumble of Artworks|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/21/movies/21barnes.html?pagewanted=2|newspaper=nytimes.com}}</ref> Executive Producer [[Lenny Feinberg]] said \"[We had] no idea we would ever be where we are today ... everywhere we go, there's lines of people.

Watson, chairman of the Barnes Foundation board of trustees and one of the figures criticized in the film, published an editorial letter in ''[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]'' claiming the film \"lacks objectivity and perspective.\"<ref>[http://www.barnesfoundation.org/v_p_inq_86738677.html \"New movie misrepresents the Barnes Collection and its move to Philadelphia.\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101212031246/http://barnesfoundation.org/v_p_inq_86738677.html |date=2010-12-12 }} ''[[The Barnes Foundation]]''</ref> [[Derek Gillman]], president and executive director of the foundation, said, \"The film was full of unsubstantiated allegations and very one-sided.

It was drawn up by the best legal minds. It is clear that what happened to his collection was against his wishes. It is clear that the city fathers acted in obviation of those wishes, and were upheld in a court of appeals.
