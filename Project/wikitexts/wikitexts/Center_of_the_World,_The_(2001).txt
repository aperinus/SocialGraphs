It stars [[Peter Sarsgaard]] as a [[dot-com millionaire]] who hires a drummer/stripper ([[Molly Parker]]) to stay with him in Las Vegas for three days for [[US$]]10,000. The film was screened out of competition at the [[2001 Cannes Film Festival]].<ref name=\"festival-cannes.com\">{{cite web |title=Festival de Cannes: The Center of the World |url=https://www.festival-cannes.com/en/films/the-center-of-the-world |accessdate=2009-10-24 |work=festival-cannes.com}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nA couple checks into a hotel suite in Las Vegas. Flashbacks show that he's a computer whiz on the verge of becoming a [[Dot-com company|dot-com]] millionaire. She's a [[lap dancer]] at a club. He's depressed, withdrawing from work, missing meetings with investors. He wants a connection, so he offers her $10,000 to spend three nights with him in Vegas. She accepts with conditions: four hours per night of erotic play, and no penetration.\n\nDuring the days in Vegas, they get to know each other, have fun, and meet a friend of hers, [[casino dealer]] Jerri. After the first night, things get complicated. When the three days are over, the stripper makes it clear that she was only there for the money and that the man she spent the time with was just a client. Upset that his feelings aren't reciprocated, he rapes her; she makes no attempt to stop him. She then masturbates for him, achieving orgasm, saying \"you want to see real? I'll show you real.\" The next day he returns home heartbroken.\n\nThe movie ends with his return to the strip club to see the woman he fell in love with again. She greets him fondly but interacts with him the way she had when they first met: as a stripper and a client ordering a lap dance.\n\nBecause the film is shown in a non-linear format, it is left to the viewer to interpret the ending. One could believe that the film ends with the meeting at the strip club and a chance for the two characters to have a real relationship together, or one could believe that the strip club meeting occurred earlier in time and the film ends with the characters going their separate ways in life.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Peter Sarsgaard]] as Richard Longman\n* [[Molly Parker]] as Florence\n* [[Mel Gorham]] as Roxanne\n* Shane Edelman as Porter\n* Karry Brown as Lap dancer\n* [[Alisha Klass]] as Pandora stripper \n* Lisa Newlan as Porn site woman\n* [[Jason Calacanis]] as Pete\n* Travis Miljan as Dog owner\n* Jerry Sherman as Old man\n* [[Carla Gugino]] as Jerri\n* [[Pat Morita]] as Taxi driver\n* [[Balthazar Getty]] as Brian Pivano\n* [[Robert Lefkowitz]] as Motel manager\n* John Lombardo as Gondolier\n{{Div col end}}\n\n== Production ==\n\n=== Development ===\nIn January 2000, Wayne Wang announced plans to direct ''The Center of the World'' for Artisan Entertainment.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web |last=Fleming |first=Michael |date=2000-01-20 |title=Wang commits to \u2018Center\u2019 for Artisan |url=https://variety.com/2000/film/news/wang-commits-to-center-for-artisan-1117761078/ |access-date=2022-10-20 |website=Variety |language=en-US}}</ref> Wang said he \"wanted to make a really erotic film about sex and love, that could be like \u2018''[[Last Tango in Paris|The Last Tango in Paris]]''\u2019 for a younger generation.
