The screenplay by [[Lewis Colick]], based on the [[October Sky (book)|memoir of the same name]], tells the true story of [[Homer Hickam|Homer H. Hickam Jr.]], a [[Coal mining|coal miner]]'s son who was inspired by the launch of ''[[Sputnik 1]]'' in 1957 to take up [[Amateur rocketry|rocketry]] against his father's wishes and eventually became a [[NASA]] engineer.\n\n''October Sky'' is based on the lives of four young men who grew up in [[Coalwood, West Virginia]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.coalwoodwestvirginia.com/|title=Coalwood, West Virginia|website=www.coalwoodwestvirginia.com|access-date=January 29, 2018}}</ref> [[Principal photography]] took place in rural [[East Tennessee]], including [[Oliver Springs, Tennessee|Oliver Springs]], [[Harriman, Tennessee|Harriman]] and [[Kingston, Tennessee|Kingston]] in [[Morgan County, Tennessee|Morgan]] and [[Roane County, Tennessee|Roane]] counties.

It is also used in a period radio broadcast describing ''Sputnik 1'' as it crossed the \"October Sky\". Homer Hickam said that \"Universal Studios marketing people got involved and they just had to change the title because, according to their research, women over thirty would never see a movie titled ''Rocket Boys''.\"<ref>[http://www.homerhickam.com/faq.shtml Homer Hickam official Web site - October Sky/Rocket Boys, The Keeper's Son<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080208083154/http://www.homerhickam.com/faq.shtml|date=February 8, 2008|title=}}</ref> The book was later re-released with the name in order to capitalize on interest in the film.{{citation needed|date = August 2021}}\n\n==Plot==\nIn October 1957, news of the [[Soviet Union]]'s launch of ''[[Sputnik 1]]'' reaches the town of [[Coalwood, West Virginia]], where most male residents work in the coal mines. As the townspeople gather outside to see the satellite orbit across the sky, [[Homer Hickam]] is inspired to build his own rockets to escape the tedium of Coalwood. His family and classmates do not respond kindly, especially his father John, the mine superintendent, who wants Homer to join him in the mines.\n\nHomer teams up with math geek [[Quentin Wilson]], who shares an interest in [[aerospace engineering]]; with the support of friends Roy Lee Cooke and Sherman O'Dell, and their science teacher at Big Creek High School, Miss [[Freida J. Riley]], the four construct small rockets. While their first launches fail, they experiment with new fuels and designs and eventually succeed. Though the local paper runs a story about the boys, they are accused of starting a [[wildfire]] with a stray rocket and are arrested. After John picks up Homer, Roy Lee is beaten by his abusive stepfather, Vernon. John intervenes and rescues Roy Lee, warning Vernon that he will protect Roy Lee as Roy Lee's late father would have.\n\nIn the aftermath of the arrest, the boys are dejected and abandon rocketry, destroying their launch site. In a [[mining accident]], John is injured rescuing others, and Ike Bykovsky (a mine worker who let Homer use the machine shop for fabricating rocket components, and later transferred underground for better pay) is killed. Homer drops out of high school to work in the mine and provide for his family while his father recovers.\n\nLater, Homer is inspired by Miss Riley to read a book on applied rocket science, learning to calculate the trajectory of a rocket. Using this, he and Quentin locate their missing rocket and prove it could not have caused the fire. The boys present their findings to Miss Riley and the school principal, Mr. Turner, who determines the cause was a [[flare]] from a nearby airfield. Homer returns to school by special invitation; the boys return to rocketry and win the school [[science fair]]. When the opportunity arises for one of them to participate in the National Science Fair in [[Indianapolis]], they elect Homer.\n\nThe miner's union goes on strike against the coal company, angering John. While the family eats dinner, Vernon shoots into the kitchen but misses John, who dismisses his family's fears, leading to a heated argument with Homer. With the mines set to close and resenting his father's pressures, Homer storms out of the house, vowing never to return.\n\nAt the national science fair, Homer's display is well-received, and he enjoys popularity and some sightseeing. Overnight, someone steals his machined rocket part model \u2013 the [[de Laval nozzle]] \u2013 and his autographed picture of Dr. [[Wernher von Braun]]. Homer makes an urgent phone call home to his mother Elsie, who implores John to end the ongoing strike so that Mr. Bolden, Bykovsky's replacement, can use the machine shop to build a replacement nozzle. John relents when Elsie, fed up with his lack of support for their son, threatens to leave him. With the town's support and replacement parts quickly sent to [[Indianapolis]] by bus, the boys win the top prize and Homer is bombarded with college scholarship offers. He is also congratulated by Von Braun himself, though not realizing his idol's identity.\n\nHomer returns to Coalwood as a hero and visits Miss Riley, who is dying of [[Hodgkin's lymphoma]]. At the launch of their largest rocket yet \u2013 the ''Miss Riley'' \u2013 John, who never attended any of the launchings, shows up at the last moment and is given the honor of pushing the launch button. The ''Miss Riley'' reaches an altitude of {{convert|30000|ft}} \u2013 higher than the summit of [[Mount Everest]]. As the town looks up to the skies, John slowly puts his hand on Homer's shoulder and smiles, finally showing Homer that he is proud of him.\n\nAn epilogue, using home movie footage, reveals the real life outcomes of the main characters' lives.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Jake Gyllenhaal]] as [[Homer Hickam]]\n* [[Chris Cooper]] as John Hickam\n* [[Chris Owen (actor)|Chris Owen]] as Quentin Wilson\n* [[Laura Dern]] as Miss Freida J.

Although the film takes place in West Virginia, Tennessee was the location of choice for filming in part because of the weather and area terrain. Film crews reconstructed the sites to look like the 1957 mining town setting the movie demanded. The weather of east Tennessee gave the filmmakers trouble and delayed production of the film. Cast and crew recalled the major weather shifts and tornadoes in the area during the filming months but Joe Johnston claims, \"ultimately, the movie looks great because of it. It gave the film a much more interesting and varied look.\"<ref name=Coalwood /><ref name=\"Canerday Interview\">{{cite web|url=https://www.al.com/entertainment/index.ssf/2014/07/october_sky_actress_natalie_ca.html|title='October Sky' actress Natalie Canerday on Jake Gyllenhaal, Chris Cooper, film's legacy 15 years after debut|last1=Kazek|first1=Kelly|date=July 23, 2014|website=al.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191014124404/https://www.al.com/entertainment/2014/07/october_sky_actress_natalie_ca.html|archive-date=October 14, 2019|access-date=August 14, 2020}}</ref> The crews also recreated a mine for the underground scenes. Johnston expressed that he felt that the appearance of the mine in the film gave it an evil look, like the mine was the villain in the film and felt it ironic because that is what gave the town its nourishment. More than 2000 extras were used in the movie. A small switching yard allowed the filmmakers and actors to film the scenes with the boys on the railroad and gave them freedom to do as they pleased, even tear apart tracks. The locomotive used in the scene was [[Southern Railway 4501]] re-lettered as Norfolk and Western No. 4501.

In an interview in 2014, [[Natalie Canerday]] recalled that Gyllenhaal was tutored on set because he was still in [[high school|school]] and taking advanced classes.<ref name=\"Canerday Interview\"/>\n\n==Release==\n''October Sky'' opened on February 19, 1999 in 1,495 theaters and had an opening weekend gross of $5,905,250.

The movie has had a total lifetime gross of $34,675,800 worldwide.<ref name=\"mojo\" />\n\n==Reception==\n===Critical reception===\n''October Sky'' received generally positive reviews. Review aggregator [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reports that 91% out of 74 critics gave the film a positive review, with a rating average of 7.6/10.

A lot of reviews focus on the main character's relationship with his father and on the actors' performances. [[Roger Ebert]], who gave the film three-and-a-half stars out of four, recognized that the film \"doesn't simplify the father into a bad guy or a tyrant. He understandably wants his son to follow in his footsteps, and one of the best elements of the movie is in breaking free, he is respecting his father. This movie has deep values.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/october-sky-1999 |title=October Sky Review |last=Ebert |first=Roger |author-link=Roger Ebert |date=February 19, 1999|website=[[RogerEbert.com]]|access-date=July 30, 2014 |quote=Immensely entertaining and unabashedly inspirational. }}</ref>\n\nJames Wall of ''[[The Christian Century]]'' describes the film's concentration on the father-son relationship as \"at times painful to watch. There are no winners or losers when sons go their separate ways.
