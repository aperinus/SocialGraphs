It was produced by [[Brad Wyman]] and [[Chris Hanley]] and features a large ensemble cast of actors, including Buscemi, [[Anthony LaPaglia]], [[Chlo\u00eb Sevigny]], and [[Samuel L. Jackson]]. The film's [[black humor]] is based on examination of characters' [[self-destructive]] behavior, centered around their shared hangout of the titular bar and lounge. Critical reception was mostly positive. ''Trees Lounge'' has also been cited as an influence by ''[[The Sopranos]]'' creator [[David Chase]], who later hired Buscemi to direct \"[[Pine Barrens (The Sopranos)|Pine Barrens]]\" and three other episodes of the show, and to star as [[Tony Soprano]]'s cousin [[Tony Blundetto]] during the show's [[The Sopranos (season 5)|fifth season]].<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2001/jul/16/guardianinterviewsatbfisouthbank | location=London | work=The Guardian | title=Steve Buscemi (II) | date=July 17, 2001}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.dga.org/Craft/DGAQ/All-Articles/0701-Spring-2007/Television-The-Sopranos.aspx|title=Shooting the Sopranos|first=Jeffrey |last=Ressner|magazine=DGA Quarterly|year=2007}}</ref> It was filmed in [[Glendale, Queens|Glendale]], [[Queens]]; [[Brooklyn]]; and [[Valley Stream]], New York.<ref>{{Cite news |date=February 28, 1997 |title=A New Leaf: 'Trees Lounge' Lets the Multi-Faceted Steve Buscemi Flex His Directorial Muscles |work=Morning Call |url=https://www.mcall.com/news/mc-xpm-1997-02-28-3130775-story.html |url-status=dead |access-date=October 25, 2022 |archive-url=http://archive.today/2022.10.25-105403/https://www.mcall.com/news/mc-xpm-1997-02-28-3130775-story.html |archive-date=October 25, 2022}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nTommy Basilio is an [[alcoholism|alcoholic]] and fixture at a local bar, the Trees Lounge, who loses his girlfriend of eight years and his job as a mechanic. After his Uncle Al dies while driving his [[ice cream truck]], Tommy goes to his [[wake (ceremony)|wake]] and indulges in [[cocaine]] with his brother and cousins. Tommy takes them to the Trees Lounge to carry on drinking, but a brawl breaks out between his cousin and Mike, another regular. After buying more beer at a late night convenience store, Mike and Tommy discuss how Tommy stole money from Rob, the owner of the garage where he lost his job. They discuss how Rob is dating Tommy's pregnant ex-girlfriend Theresa, with the child's paternity in doubt.\n\nMike turns out to be the owner of the moving company across the street from the Trees Lounge. Tommy asks for work, but Mike says he doesn't need a mechanic. Tommy takes on Uncle Al's ice-cream route, but children initially do not buy from him. Theresa's flirtatious seventeen-year-old niece, Debbie, joins Tommy on his route, saying she had a dream about him. Mike's wife and daughter have left him because of his drinking, and tell him they plan to move [[Upstate New York|upstate]]. Debbie and friend Kelly go to the Trees Lounge but are unable to prove they are of [[legal drinking age]]. Debbie claims her 'boyfriend' Tommy will vouch for her. Mike, Tommy and the two girls go to Mike's house for more drinking, but are asked to leave when Mike's wife calls.\n\nTommy and Debbie spend the night together at his place. Realizing her father, Jerry, might not forgive her, Debbie calls Tommy and asks to stay with him, but he fears Jerry's reaction and turns her down. She instead decides to leave town with her friend Puck to stay with a cousin in New York City. Jerry meanwhile tries to reconstruct his daughter's steps, and visits Trees Lounge to ask questions. The next day, as Tommy sits in the ice cream truck outside a baseball game, chatting with Mike and his wife, Jerry tracks him down. The irate father bashes him on the head with a [[baseball bat]], smashes the lights and windows of the ice-cream truck, and throws all of Tommy's money and ice cream into the parking lot where they are confiscated by gleeful children. After Theresa has her baby, Tommy goes to the hospital and tries to make amends. When Tommy returns to the Trees Lounge, he hears that an elderly regular customer named Bill collapsed and was taken to the hospital in critical condition. The barmaid and other regulars discuss how someone should visit Bill in the hospital, but they forget about him as they carry on drinking. Tommy sits in Bill's favorite seat and drinks a bottle of beer, realizing what his life has become.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n*[[Steve Buscemi]] as Tommy Basilio\n*[[Chlo\u00eb Sevigny]] as Debbie\n*[[Mark Boone Junior]] as Mike\n*[[Anthony LaPaglia]] as Rob\n*[[Elizabeth Bracco]] as Theresa\n*[[Eszter Balint]] as Marie\n*[[Carol Kane]] as Connie\n*[[Daniel Baldwin]] as Jerry\n*[[Mimi Rogers]] as Patty\n*[[Debi Mazar]] as Crystal\n*[[Seymour Cassel]] as Uncle Al\n*[[Samuel L.
