She's gone to sleazy photographer Raymond Escobar's ([[Jerry Stiller]]) studio to reclaim some photos from him because they were \"lots more artistic than I bargained for.\"  Escobar assures her that he knows [[Hugh Hefner]] and she will certainly make it to the top. But Nadine has second thoughts, as she wants her photos, and when she goes back to the studio to retrieve them, gets caught up in the middle of a murder scene. She grabs an envelope with her name on it and hightails it out of there.\n\nUnfortunately, she gets the wrong pictures. She has stolen plans for a new highway development that ends up in the hands of her estranged husband Vernon ([[Jeff Bridges]]), a handsome, wise-mouthed bum who owns a  bar called the Blue Bonnet which no one goes to and that's not the worst of it. He's fooling around with a former Pecan Queen who works for the Lone Star Brewing company ([[Glenne Headly]]).  He sees a way to make a bundle of money in all this.\n\nShady real estate kingpin Buford Pope ([[Rip Torn]]) wants the plans back and will stop at nothing to get them. The couple is soon on the run not only from Buford but from police who believe they've killed Escobar.  All this time, Nadine and Vernon want a divorce, and Nadine hasn't told Vernon she's pregnant with his baby.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Jeff Bridges]] as Vernon Hightower\n* [[Kim Basinger]] as Nadine Hightower\n* [[Rip Torn]] as Buford Pope\n* [[Gwen Verdon]] as Vera\n* [[Glenne Headly]] as Ren\u00e9e Lomax\n* [[Jerry Stiller]] as Raymond Escobar\n\n==Production==\nThe film was written specifically for Kim Basinger.\nShooting began on September 30, 1986 in [[Austin, Texas]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://catalog.afi.com/Catalog/MovieDetails/57757|title=AFI-Catalog|website=catalog.afi.com}}</ref> and further shooting took place in [[San Antonio]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mysanantonio.com/entertainment/article/15-surprising-films-shot-in-S-A-5994773.php|title=15 surprising films shot in San Antonio - HoustonChronicle.com|date=5 January 2015|website=www.mysanantonio.com}}</ref>\nThe framed picture of Jeff Bridges in a uniform in the film is taken from ''[[The Last Picture Show]]'' (1971).\nMuch of the soundtrack was provided by the country group [[Sweethearts of the Rodeo]].\n\n==Release==\n\n===Critical reception===\n[[Rotten Tomatoes]] gives ''Nadine'' a rating of 46% from 13 reviews.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/nadine | title=Nadine | website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] }}</ref>\n\n===Home media===\nThe film was released on [[VHS]] with a 4:3 ratio in 1988, and on [[DVD]] with a 1.85:1 ratio on July 5, 2005.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|0093596}}\n* {{rotten-tomatoes|nadine|Nadine}}\n* {{Mojo title|nadine|Nadine}}\n\n{{Robert Benton}}\n\n[[Category:1987 films]]\n[[Category:American romantic comedy films]]\n[[Category:1980s crime thriller films]]\n[[Category:1987 romantic comedy films]]\n[[Category:American comedy thriller films]]\n[[Category:1980s English-language films]]\n[[Category:Films set in Austin, Texas]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Austin, Texas]]\n[[Category:Films shot in San Antonio]]\n[[Category:Films set in 1954]]\n[[Category:TriStar Pictures films]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by Robert Benton]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Howard Shore]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Robert Benton]]\n[[Category:1980s American films]]"}]}}}}
