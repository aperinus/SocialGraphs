Directed by [[P. J. Hogan]], the film stars [[Isla Fisher]] as the shopaholic journalist and [[Hugh Dancy]] as her boss.\n\n==Plot==\n[[Becky Bloomwood|Rebecca \"Becky\" Bloomwood]] is a [[Shopping addiction|shopping addict]] who lives in [[New York City]] with her best friend Suze. She works as a journalist for a gardening magazine but dreams of joining the fashion magazine ''Alette''. On the way to an interview with ''Alette'', she tries to purchase a green scarf, but her credit card is declined. Rebecca goes to a hot dog stand and offers to buy all the hot dogs with a check if the seller gives her back change in cash, claiming that the scarf is meant to be a gift for her sick aunt. The vendor refuses but another customer gives her the $20 she needs for the scarf.\n\nWhen Rebecca arrives at the interview, she's told that the position has been filled internally. However, the receptionist tells her there is an open position with the magazine ''Successful Saving'', explaining that getting a job at ''Successful Saving'' could eventually lead to a position at ''Alette'' magazine. Rebecca interviews with Luke Brandon, the editor of ''Successful Saving'' and the man who had given her the $20. She hides her scarf outside his office, but Luke's assistant comes into the office and gives it back to her. Knowing she has been caught, Rebecca leaves.\n\nThat evening, she and Suze get drunk and write letters to ''Alette'' and ''Successful Saving'', respectively, but in her intoxicated state she mails each to the wrong magazine. Luke likes the letter she meant to send to ''Alette'' and hires her. Rather than completing a work assignment for a new column, Rebecca goes to a clothing sale. While inspecting a cashmere coat that she had just purchased, she realizes it is not 100% cashmere and she has been duped. This gives her an idea for the column, which she writes and submits to Luke. As Rebecca is hesitant to use her real name, Luke publishes it under the moniker \"The Girl in the Green Scarf.\"\n\n\"The Girl in The Green Scarf\" becomes a huge hit among business groups, and even Rebecca's own parents advise her to read her articles. The articles are referenced in business groups in Asia, causing the ''Successful Saving'' magazine to go international. This brings much praise to Rebecca, from her peers in the workplace, and her friend Suze. \"The Girl In The Green Scarf\" becomes so popular that she is asked to participate in a TV interview. Rebecca meets with the editor of ''Alette'' to purchase a dress for the interview.\n\nRebecca later returns home to renewed confrontations with her debt collector, Derek Smeath. Suze makes her attend Shopaholics Anonymous. After purchasing dresses for her interview and Suze\u2019s wedding, she meets a seemingly friendly woman, Miss Korch, only to learn that she is the new Shopaholics Anonymous group leader. Miss Korch forces Rebecca to donate all the clothes she just bought, not believing her when Rebecca says one of the dresses is for her friend\u2019s wedding. After the meeting, Rebecca can't afford to buy back both dresses and buys back the interview dress, leaving the bridesmaid's dress behind. During the interview, Derek Smeath is in the audience and confronts Rebecca. ''Successful Saving'' terminates Rebecca's column after the public confrontation for bringing discredit on the magazine and believing she is a risk for not paying her debts.\n\nSuze is furious and hurt when she finds out that Rebecca lost the bridesmaid dress. Rebecca's father, Graham, is more sympathetic, remarking that the United States has not fallen despite its [[United States public debt|gigantic national debt]], and offers to sell his [[recreational vehicle]] to help her. Rebecca declines his offer, saying that he earned the camper through years of hard work and saving, and that she will need to tackle her debts on her own. ''Alette'' offers Rebecca a position at the magazine, but she declines after realizing she\u2019d be expected to lie to the readers. Meanwhile, Luke starts a new company, Brandon Communications.\n\nIn order to earn the money to repay her debts, the members of Shopaholic Anonymous help Rebecca stage a clothes sale, which generates a lot of revenue, but not enough to retire her debts. She finally sells her green scarf when a woman bids on it for $300, making it possible for her to give all the cash to the debt collector, which she pays in pennies\u2014to give it to him in the \"most inconvenient way possible\".\n\nRebecca makes it to the wedding after reclaiming her bridesmaid dress and Suze forgives her. After the wedding, Rebecca walks past an Yves Saint Laurent store window. She is briefly tempted to buy a new purse and dress, but eventually walks away. Rebecca then runs into Luke who returns the green scarf to her, revealing that the woman who bought it was his agent. Rebecca and Luke kiss and Rebecca begins working with Luke at his new company.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Isla Fisher]] as [[Becky Bloomwood|Rebecca Bloomwood]]\n* [[Hugh Dancy]] as Luke Brandon\n* [[Krysten Ritter]] as Suze Cleath-Stuart\n* [[John Goodman]] as Graham Bloomwood\n* [[Joan Cusack]] as Jane Bloomwood\n* [[John Lithgow]] as Edgar West\n* [[Kristin Scott Thomas]] as Alette Naylor\n* [[Leslie Bibb]] as Alicia Billington\n* [[Robert Stanton (actor)|Robert Stanton]] as Derek Smeath\n* [[Lynn Redgrave]] as a Drunken Lady at Party\n* [[Julie Hagerty]] as Hayley\n* Nick Cornish as Tarquin Cleath-Stuart\n* [[Stephen Guarino]] as Allon\n* [[Fred Armisen]] as Ryan Koenig\n* [[Wendie Malick]] as Miss Korch\n* [[Clea Lewis]] as Miss Ptaszinski\n* [[John Salley]] as D.
