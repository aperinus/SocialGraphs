The film stars [[Vera Farmiga]], [[Peter Sarsgaard]], [[Isabelle Fuhrman]], [[CCH Pounder]] and [[Jimmy Bennett]]. The plot centers on a couple who, after the death of their unborn child, adopt a psychopathic nine-year-old girl with a mysterious past.\n\nThe film is an [[international co-production]] between the United States, Canada, Germany and France. It was produced by [[Joel Silver]] and [[Susan Downey]] of [[Dark Castle Entertainment]], and [[Leonardo DiCaprio]] and Jennifer Davisson Killoran of Appian Way Productions. [[Principal photography]]&nbsp;for the film took place in&nbsp;Canada, in the cities of&nbsp;[[St. Thomas, Ontario|St. Thomas]],&nbsp;[[Toronto]],&nbsp;[[Port Hope, Ontario|Port Hope]], and&nbsp;[[Montreal]].\n\n''Orphan'' was released in the United States on July 24, 2009, by [[Warner Bros. Pictures]]. The film received mixed reviews from critics, who praised its dark humor, scares and Fuhrman's performance as Esther, but criticized its formulaic screenplay, uneven pacing and two-hour runtime. The film grossed $78 million worldwide against a $20 million budget. A prequel, titled ''[[Orphan: First Kill]]'', was released in 2022, with Fuhrman reprising her role.\n\n==Plot==\nKate and John Coleman's marriage is strained after the [[stillbirth]] of their third child, Jessica, whose loss is particularly hard on Kate who is a recovering alcoholic. She and John decide to adopt a 9-year-old [[Russians|Russian]] girl, Esther, from St. Mariana's Home for Girls, a local orphanage. Their 5-year-old deaf daughter, Max, embraces Esther, but their 12-year-old son, Daniel, is less welcoming.\n\nOne night, Kate and John begin to have sex until Esther interrupts them. Kate becomes suspicious when Esther expresses far more knowledge of sex than expected of a child her age. Esther then exhibits hostile behavior in front of Max and Daniel, such as [[Animal euthanasia|killing]] an injured pigeon and badly injuring a classmate who was bullying her. Sister Abigail, the head of the orphanage, visits the household, warning Kate and John that tragic events and incidents occur around Esther, including the house fire that [[Orphan: First Kill|killed her last adoptive family]]. When Sister Abigail leaves, Esther causes her to crash her car on the road and then bludgeons her to death with a hammer. She forces Max to help her move the body and then hides the evidence in Daniel's treehouse. Daniel sees them at the treehouse, and later that night, she interrogates him about what he saw, threatening to [[Castration|castrate]] him if he tells Kate and John.\n\nAs Kate becomes further convinced about Esther's unusual behavior, John believes she is being paranoid and tells Esther to do something nice for Kate. Esther rips out the flowers from Jessica's grave and gives them to Kate as a bouquet. Kate is horrified and roughly grabs Esther's arm in distress, asserting that she did this on purpose. That night, Esther breaks her own arm and falsely blames Kate, causing further strife in Kate and John's marriage. The next day, Esther releases the brake in the car, causing it to roll into oncoming traffic with Max inside. She also points out the wine she found in the kitchen, causing John and Kate's therapist to suggest Kate returns to rehab, with John threatening to leave her and take the children if she refuses. Kate discovers that Esther came from an Estonian [[mental hospital]] named the Saarne Instituute, and the orphanage she claims she was from has no record of her.\n\nWhen Daniel learns about Sister Abigail's death from Max and searches the treehouse, Esther sets it on fire and attempts to kill him but is thwarted by Max. Daniel is seriously injured, and while in the hospital in ICU, Esther tries to smother him to death with a pillow, but doctors revive him. Kate, enraged, slaps Esther before she is restrained and sedated. That night, Esther dresses provocatively and attempts to seduce John, who threatens to send Esther back to the orphanage after realizing Kate had been right about Esther's behavior.\n\nAt the hospital, Kate is contacted by Dr. V\u00e4rava of the Saarne Instituute and learns that Esther is actually a 33-year-old woman named Leena Klammer, born in [[Estonian Soviet Socialist Republic|Estonia]]. She has [[hypopituitarism]], a rare hormonal disorder that stunted her physical growth and caused proportional dwarfism, and she has spent most of her life posing as a little girl. Leena is violent and has murdered at least seven people, [[Orphan: First Kill|including the last family that adopted her]]. After failing to seduce her adoptive father, Leena removes the ribbons she was wearing around her wrists and neck, which have been hiding scars from trying to break out of [[straitjackets]] during her time at the asylum. Leena removes her disguise and stabs John to death. Kate rushes home, and Leena attempts to shoot her, wounding her arm. After Leena opens fire on Max, Kate breaks through the greenhouse roof and knocks Leena unconscious.\n\nKate and Max flee as police arrive, but Leena attacks Kate near the frozen pond, hurling them onto the ice. Max tries to shoot Leena but shatters the ice instead, sending Leena and Kate underwater. Kate begins to climb out, with Leena clinging to her legs. Leena reverts to her Esther persona, begging \"Mommy\" not to let her die with a knife hidden behind her back. Kate retorts angrily that she is not Leena's \"f*cking mommy\" and kicks her in the face, breaking her neck. Leena's body sinks into the dark pond as Kate and Max are met by the police.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Vera Farmiga]] as Kate Coleman\n* [[Peter Sarsgaard]] as John Coleman\n* [[Isabelle Fuhrman]] as Esther<!-- NAMES SHOULD MATCH THE FILM'S CREDITS.
