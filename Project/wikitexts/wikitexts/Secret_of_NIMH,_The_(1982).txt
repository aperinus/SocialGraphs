O'Brien (author)|Robert C. O'Brien]]'s 1971 [[children's novel]], ''[[Mrs. Frisby and the Rats of NIMH]]''. The film features the voices of [[Elizabeth Hartman]], [[Peter Strauss]], [[Arthur Malet]], [[Dom DeLuise]], [[John Carradine]], [[Derek Jacobi]], [[Hermione Baddeley]], and [[Paul Shenar]]. It is produced by Bluth's production company [[Sullivan Bluth Studios|Don Bluth Productions]] in association with [[Aurora Productions, Hollywood|Aurora Productions]],.\n\n''The Secret of NIMH'' was released in the United States on July 16, 1982, by [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM/UA Entertainment Co.]] under the [[United Artists]] label. It was followed in 1998 by a [[direct-to-video]] sequel, ''[[The Secret of NIMH 2: Timmy to the Rescue]]'', which was made without Bluth's involvement or input and met with poor reception. In 2015, a [[live-action]]/[[Computer-generated imagery|computer-animated]] remake was reported to be in the works.<ref name=\"ignreboot\">{{cite web |url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2015/03/04/live-actioncg-rats-of-nimh-movie-in-the-works |title=Live-Action/CG Rats of NIMH Movie in the Works |website=IGN |author=Nicholson, Max |date=March 4, 2015 |access-date=October 19, 2015 |archive-date=October 15, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151015074326/http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/03/04/live-actioncg-rats-of-nimh-movie-in-the-works |url-status=live}}</ref> A television series adaptation is also in development by the [[Fox Corporation]].\n\n== Plot ==\nMrs. Brisby,{{Efn|Changed from \"Mrs. Frisby\" in the original novel. See [[#Writing|\"Writing\"]] section for full explanation.|name=Brisby}} a widowed field mouse, lives in a cinder block with her children on the Fitzgibbons' farm. Brisby longs to move her family out of the field as plowing time approaches but her son Timothy has fallen ill. \n\nBrisby visits Mr. Ages, a friend of her late husband, Jonathan. Ages diagnoses the illness as [[pneumonia]], provides Brisby with medicine, and warns her that Timothy must stay inside for at least three weeks or he could die. On her way home, Brisby befriends Jeremy, a clumsy but friendly crow. They both narrowly escape from the Fitzgibbons' cat, Dragon. The next morning, Brisby discovers that Farmer Fitzgibbons has started plowing early. Although her neighbor Auntie Shrew helps her disable his tractor, Brisby knows she must devise another plan. Jeremy takes her to meet the Great Owl, who tells her to visit a colony of rats that live beneath a rose bush on the farm and ask for the services of Nicodemus, their wise and mystical leader.\n\nBrisby enters the rose bush and encounters an aggressive guard rat named Brutus, who chases her away. She is led back in by Ages, and is amazed to see the rats' use of electricity and other technology. Brisby meets Justin, the friendly [[captain of the guard]]; Jenner, a ruthless and power-hungry rat opposed to Nicodemus; and finally Nicodemus himself. From Nicodemus, she learns that many years ago the rats, along with her husband and Ages, were part of a series of experiments at the [[National Institute of Mental Health]] (NIMH for short). The experiments boosted their intelligence, enabling them to escape, as well as extending their lifespans and slowing their aging processes. However, they are unable to live as typical rats would, and need human technology to survive, which they have accomplished only by stealing. Nicodemus has authorized a plan for the rats to leave the farm and live independently in an area they refer to as Thorn Valley.\n\nNicodemus gives Brisby a magical [[amulet]] that will activate when the wearer is courageous. Because of the rats' relationship with Jonathan, they agree to help her move her home. First, they need to drug Dragon so that it can be done safely. Only Brisby can do this, as the rats cannot fit through the hole leading into the house; Jonathan was killed by Dragon in a previous attempt, while Ages broke his leg in another. That night, she puts the drug into Dragon's dish, but the Fitzgibbons' son, Billy, catches her. While trapped in a birdcage, she overhears a telephone conversation between Farmer Fitzgibbons and the staff of NIMH and learns that the institute intends to exterminate the rats in the morning. Brisby then escapes from the cage and runs off to warn them.\n\nAs a rainstorm approaches, the rats begin moving the Brisby home, with the children and Auntie Shrew inside, using a rope and pulley system. Jenner, who wishes for the rats to remain in the rose bush, sabotages the assembly with his reluctant accomplice Sullivan, causing it to fall apart and crush Nicodemus to death. Brisby soon arrives to warn the rats about NIMH's arrival, but Jenner attacks her and attempts to steal the amulet. Sullivan alerts Justin, who comes to Brisby's aid. Jenner mortally wounds Sullivan but is injured by Justin in a sword fight. As Jenner attempts to attack Justin from behind, the dying Sullivan throws a dagger into his back, killing him. The Brisby home begins to sink into a mud puddle and Brisby and the rats are unable to raise it. Brisby's will to save her family gives power to the amulet, which she uses to lift the house and move it to safety. The next morning, the rats, with Justin as their new leader, have departed for Thorn Valley as Timothy begins to recover. Jeremy soon meets Miss Right, another crow who is just as clumsy as he is, and they fall in love.\n\n== Voice cast ==\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Elizabeth Hartman]] as Mrs. Brisby\n* [[Dom DeLuise]] as Jeremy\n* [[Peter Strauss]] as Justin\n* [[Arthur Malet]] as Mr. Ages\n* [[Derek Jacobi]] as Nicodemus\n* [[Paul Shenar]] as Jenner\n* [[John Carradine]] as The Great Owl\n* [[Hermione Baddeley]] as Auntie Shrew\n* [[Aldo Ray]] as Sullivan\n* [[Shannen Doherty]] as Teresa Brisby\n* [[Wil Wheaton]] as Martin Brisby\n* [[Ina Fried]]{{Efn|Credited as \"Ian Fried\"; ''The Secret of NIMH'' was released before Fried [[coming out|came out]] as [[transgender]].|name=Ina Fried}} as Timothy Brisby\n* Jodi Hicks as Cynthia Brisby\n* [[Edie McClurg]] as Miss Right\n* [[Tom Hatten]] as Farmer Fitzgibbons\n* [[Lucille Bliss]] as Mrs. Fitzgibbons\n* Joshua Lawrence as Billy Fitzgibbons\n* [[Charles Champlin]], [[Dick Kleiner]], and Norbert Auerbach as council rats\n}}\n\n== Production ==\n=== Background ===\nThe film rights to the book ''[[Mrs. Frisby and the Rats of NIMH]]'' had reportedly been offered to [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Walt Disney Productions]] in 1972, but they were turned down.{{sfn|Cawley|1991|page=41}}\n\n''The Secret of NIMH'' was the first feature film to be directed by [[Don Bluth]]. On September 13, 1979, Bluth, fellow animators [[Gary Goldman]] and [[John Pomeroy]] and eight other animation staff left the feature animation department at Disney to set up their own independent studio, [[Don Bluth Productions]]. The studio worked, at first, out of Bluth's house and garage, but moved to a two-story, {{convert|5500|sqft|adj=on}} facility in [[Studio City, California]], several months later.<ref name=\"beck\">{{cite book |last=Beck |first=Jerry |title=The Animated Movie Guide |url=https://archive.org/details/animatedmoviegui0000beck |url-access=registration |year=2005 |publisher=Chicago Review Press |isbn=1-55652-591-5 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/animatedmoviegui0000beck/page/243 243\u20134]}}</ref> While they were still working at Disney, they produced the 27-minute short film ''[[Banjo the Woodpile Cat]]'' as a side project to gain other production skills that the company and their animation program were not addressing. Bluth asked [[Ron W. Miller]], [[Walt Disney]]'s son-in-law and the president and CEO of the company at the time, to view ''Banjo'', but Miller declined. As Goldman recalled, \"that pulled the enthusiasm rug out from under us. We had hoped that the studio might like what we were doing and agree to buy the film and allow us to finish the short film in the studio, which would allow us to recoup what we had spent in terms of money and the many hours that we and the other members of the team had invested in the film\".<ref name=\"Traditional Animation\" />\n\nBefore they started making ''Banjo'', artist and story writer [[Ken Anderson (animator)|Ken Anderson]] had been getting into ''Mrs. Frisby and the Rats of NIMH'', which he called \"a wonderful story\". He gave the book to Bluth for him to read and make a film out of after Bluth finished the animation direction of ''[[Pete's Dragon (1977 film)|Pete's Dragon]]''. Bluth later showed ''NIMH'' to Disney animation director [[Wolfgang Reitherman]], who turned down Bluth's offers to make a movie based on the book: \"We've already got a mouse [named [[Mickey Mouse]]] and we've done a mouse movie [called ''[[The Rescuers]]'']\". However, Bluth also presented the novel to the other staff that would work for Don Bluth Productions later on and they all loved it. Two months later, former Disney executive James L. Stewart, who now had started [[Aurora Productions, Hollywood|Aurora Productions]], called Goldman and told him about Anderson's idea of making a film based on ''NIMH''.<ref name=\"Traditional Animation\">{{cite web|url=https://www.traditionalanimation.com/2012/30th-anniversary-of-the-secret-of-nimh-gary-goldman-exclusive/|title=30th Anniversary of Secret of NIMH \u2013 Gary Goldman Exclusive!|last=Carpenter|first=Les|date=July 2, 2012|publisher=Traditional Animation|access-date=January 1, 2016|archive-date=January 12, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160112025631/http://www.traditionalanimation.com/2012/30th-anniversary-of-the-secret-of-nimh-gary-goldman-exclusive/|url-status=live}}</ref> At Bluth, Goldman and Pomeroy's request, Aurora Productions acquired the film rights and offered Don Bluth Productions a budget of US$5.7 million and 30 months to complete the film, tighter in both budget and schedule than most Disney animated features at the time.<ref name=\"counts\" />\n\n=== Writing ===\n{{Quote box|width=275px|align=right|quote=\"The amulet was a device, or symbol, to represent the internal power of Mrs. Brisby.&nbsp;...

It also included (from the book) a female rat named Isabella (described as \"a young, cute, somewhat motor-mouthed rat with a crush on Justin\"), who was ultimately left out and much of her dialogue given to Nicodemus. A revised synopsis dated July 2, 1980 by an unattributed author would take the movie closer to its completed form, which ended with the mysterious disappearance of the rats, leading the characters and audience to wonder if they ever really existed, or were just an elaborate illusion.{{sfn|Cawley|1991|page=44}}\n\nBluth himself would later make several changes to the story, most notably with the addition of mystical elements not present in the original novel.{{sfn|Cawley|1991|pages=44\u201346}} He explained that \"regarding magic, we really believe that animation calls for some magic, to give it a special 'fantastic' quality\".<ref name=\"remember3\">{{cite web |url=http://www.adammcdaniel.com/DonBluth/Don_Bluth_Interview3.htm |author=McDaniel, Adam |title=About the Script |publisher=Remembering NIMH: An Interview with Don Bluth |access-date=October 31, 2015 |archive-date=January 12, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160112003703/http://adammcdaniel.com/DonBluth/Don_Bluth_Interview3.htm |url-status=live}}</ref> This was most apparent in the magic [[amulet]] given to Mrs. Brisby, which was meant to be a visual representation of her character's internal power, something harder to show on film. The object was also meant to introduce a [[Spirituality|spiritual]] aspect to the plot, with the director remarking: \"The stone or amulet is just a method of letting the audience know that Mrs. Brisby has found 'Courage of the Heart'. Magic? Maybe. Spiritual? Yes\".<ref name=\"remember3\" /> In the same vein, Nicodemus was made into a [[Magician (fantasy)|wizard]] to \"create more mystery\" about himself and the rats' colony. The antagonist Jenner was given much more prominence in the movie, being only mentioned as a traitor who leaves in the book, to \"add drama\" to the narrative by giving it a more visible enemy. Justin also now succeeds Nicodemus as the leader of the rats to give his character more of an [[Character arc|arc]] and allow him an opportunity to \"grow and change\".{{sfn|Cawley|1991|page=46}} Unlike the original work, Justin does not rescue Mrs. Brisby from the cage at the Fitzgibbons' house and she now helps her children without the rats' assistance by using the amulet, once again giving focus to her personal story. As Bluth put it, \"''The Secret of NIMH'' is really a story about Mrs. Brisby and her need to save her children. If the rats save her children, then she hasn't grown in the film\".{{sfn|Cawley|1991|page=46}}\n\nDuring the film's production, Aurora contacted [[Wham-O]], the manufacturers of [[Frisbee]] flying discs, with concerns about possible trademark infringements if the \"Mrs. Frisby\" name in O'Brien's original book was used in the movie. Wham-O rejected Aurora's request for waiver to use the same-sounding name to their \"Frisbee\", in the movie. Aurora informed Bluth & company that Mrs. Frisby's name would have to be altered. By then, the voice work had already been recorded for the film, so the name change to \"Mrs. Brisby\" necessitated a combination of re-recording some lines and, because John Carradine was unavailable for further recordings, careful sound editing had to be performed, taking the \"B\" sound of another word from Carradine's recorded lines, and replace the \"F\" sound with the \"B\" sound, altering the name from \"Frisby\" to \"Brisby\".{{sfn|Cawley|1991|page=50}}\n\n=== Casting ===\nGoldman described the casting process as \"exciting, fun, and sometimes strange\".<ref name=\"Traditional Animation\" /> He stated that focusing on the characteristics of each character, the voices and acting abilities were crucial, saying that using voices that added to a movie's texture was part of the team's philosophy in the development of a film. Goldman found the strangest casting decision to be [[Dom DeLuise]] for Jeremy the Crow, which Goldman, Bluth, and Pomeroy had considered after they watched the 1978 film ''[[The End (1978 film)|The End]]''.<ref name=\"Traditional Animation\" /> [[Elizabeth Hartman]] was cast as Mrs. Brisby, with Goldman calling her performance in ''[[A Patch of Blue]]'' \"so believable and sincere that we all felt that she was right for the part\". Pomeroy suggested [[Derek Jacobi]], who starred in the 1976 miniseries ''[[I, Claudius (TV series)|I, Claudius]]'', to play the part of Nicodemus.<ref name=\"Traditional Animation\" /> [[Peter Strauss]], whom the team previously saw in another miniseries from 1976, ''[[Rich Man, Poor Man (miniseries)|Rich Man, Poor Man]]'', was cast as Justin.<ref name=\"Traditional Animation\" /> [[Paul Shenar]] was assigned to play Jenner since the staff liked his \"dark, powerful voice\".<ref name=\"Traditional Animation\" /> Shakespearean actor [[John Carradine]] was \"perfect for the dark, ominous Great Owl\", while [[Aldo Ray]] was assigned to voice Jenner's reluctant accomplice Sullivan, whom Goldman said \"also had a great distinctive voice\".<ref name=\"Traditional Animation\" />\n\n=== Animation ===\n[[File:TheSecretofNIMHscreen.jpg|thumb|Mrs. Brisby meeting Nicodemus.

Among the techniques experimented with on ''The Secret of NIMH'' were [[rotoscoping]], multiple passes on the camera to achieve transparent shadows, backlit animation (where animated [[matte (filmmaking)|mattes]] are shot with light shining through [[color gel]]s to produce glowing areas for artificial light and fire effects) and multiple color palettes for characters to fit in different lighting situations, from daylight, to night, to warm environments, to underwater. Mrs. Brisby had 46 different lighting situations; therefore there were 46 different color palettes, or lists of color, for her. Two modern, computerized versions of the [[multiplane camera]] were also manufactured for this production.<ref name=\"mandell\">{{cite news |last=Mandell |first=Paul |date=June 1982 |title=Interview with Dorse Lanpher |journal=Fantastic Films |url=http://www.vanden-eykel.com/nimharchive/articles/ffmtext.htm |access-date=October 28, 2015 |via=Vanden-Eykel.com |archive-date=January 11, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160111023959/http://www.vanden-eykel.com/nimharchive/articles/ffmtext.htm |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nTo achieve the film's detailed full animation while keeping to the tight budget, the studio strove to keep any waste of time and resources to a minimum. The crew often worked long hours with no immediate financial reward (though they were offered a cut of the film's profits, a practice common for producers, directors and stars of live action films, but never before offered to artists on an animated feature);{{sfn|Cawley|1991|page=39}} producer Gary Goldman recalled working 110-hour weeks during the final six months of production. Around 100 in-house staff worked on the film, with the labor-intensive [[cel]] painting farmed out to 45 people working from home.<ref name=\"mcdaniel\">{{cite web |last=McDaniel |first=Adam |publisher=Remembering NIMH: An Interview with Don Bluth |title=Reflections on the Film |url=http://www.adammcdaniel.com/DonBluth/Don_Bluth_Interview1.htm |access-date=October 28, 2015 |archive-date=January 12, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160112003638/http://adammcdaniel.com/DonBluth/Don_Bluth_Interview1.htm |url-status=live}}</ref> Many minor roles, including incidental and crowd voice work, were filled in by the in-house staff. The final cost of the film was $6.385 million. The producers, Bluth, Goldman and Pomeroy and the executive producers at Aurora mortgaged their homes collectively for $700,000 to complete the film, with the understanding that their investment would be the first to be repaid. The film was the sixth animated feature to be presented in the [[Dolby Stereo]] sound system.\n\nIn animating Justin and Jenner's sword fight, the animators referenced similar sequences in films such as ''[[The Adventures of Robin Hood]]'' (1938) and ''[[The Vikings (film)|The Vikings]]'' (1958).<ref name=\"mcdaniel\" />\n\n==Music==\n{{Infobox album\n| name         = The Secret of NIMH Original Motion Picture Soundtrack\n| type         = soundtrack\n| artist       = Various Artists\n| cover        = \n| alt          = \n| released     = July 2, 1982\n| recorded     = \n| venue        = \n| studio       = \n| genre        = Soundtrack\n| length       = 48:17 (original release)<br /> 63:09 (2015 expansion)\n| label        = [[Var\u00e8se Sarabande]] (1982/1995)<br /> [[Intrada Records]] (2015)\n| producer     = [[Jerry Goldsmith]]\n| prev_title   = \n| prev_year    = \n| next_title   = \n| next_year    = \n| misc         = {{Extra chronology\n | artist     = Don Bluth \n | type       = soundtrack\n | prev_title =\n | prev_year  =\n | title      = The Secret of NIMH\n | year       = 1982\n | next_title = [[An American Tail#Music|An American Tail]]\n | next_year  = 1986\n}}\n}}\n\n''The Secret of NIMH: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack'' contains songs from the film written by [[Jerry Goldsmith]] and performed by the [[National Philharmonic Orchestra]].<ref name=\"allmusic\">{{cite web |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/secret-of-nimh-mw0000195653 |title=Secret of N.I.M.H. - National Philharmonic Orchestra |access-date=October 19, 2015 |website=AllMusic |archive-date=March 5, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305062451/http://www.allmusic.com/album/secret-of-nimh-mw0000195653 |url-status=live}}</ref> One song, \"Flying Dreams\" was vocally performed by [[Paul Williams (songwriter)|Paul Williams]] and [[Sally Stevens]].
