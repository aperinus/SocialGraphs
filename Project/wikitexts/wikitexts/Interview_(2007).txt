This film also features [[Tara Elders]] as Maggie, Molly Griffith as a waitress, and Philippe Vonlanthen as an autograph seeker.  Steve Buscemi is also a director of this American adaptation.

Pierre's chagrin increases given the news of a searing [[White House]] [[scandal]] that is just breaking; instead of covering the piece, Peders must visit a posh [[Manhattan]] restaurant and interview Katya, whom he instantly detests. The one-on-one is more of a disaster than either could have predicted, but by some strange twist of fate, Pierre is injured and brought back to Katya's [[loft]]. Once there, [[liquor]] is downed, [[cocaine]] is consumed, minor violence erupts, and the two begin to \"dance a [[pas de deux]]\" &mdash; attempting, not so subtly, to outmaneuver one another psychologically, as dark secrets and long-hidden vulnerabilities emerge.\n\nKatya teases Peders into kissing her, which Peders passionately does, but as her cell phone rings and reality reasserts itself, Katya demands that he stop. Peders is exasperated and complains that she doesn't let him finish what she starts, unlike the male [[prostitute]] he once visited. During another of Katya's phone calls, Peders uses Katya's [[laptop]] and opens a folder containing what he believes is Katya's [[diary]]. He is able to barely conceal his surprise when Katya eyes him suspiciously, by saying he is merely [[Googling]] her, as per an earlier suggestion by her.\n\nWhen Katya's attention returns to her phone call, Peders e-mails a particularly expressive and emotional diary passage to himself. Later, unable to forget what he had read, Peders betrays his snooping by asking Katya what has made her lose hope. After an emotional outburst about her loss of privacy, she admits that she has [[cancer]]. At this, Peders is immediately contrite about the way he has been treating her. He learns that no one knows about Katya's illness; she feels that saying it aloud will make it more \"real\".  Peders promises not to reveal the truth about her health; Katya demands that Peders reveal something about himself in return.\n\nAs Katya films the confession with a [[camcorder]], Peders admits that, as a reporter, he has made up stories and sources, and that he essentially caused his [[alcoholic]] former wife's death. (He took his time responding to her distress call to him - by the time he arrived, she was already dead.)\nKatya swaps out the camcorder tape when Peders is unaware, and a while later, Peders attempts to do the same.  On a clandestine phone call to his editor, Peders - against his promise to Katya - tells him that Katya has cancer.  Peders leaves Katya's loft, and as he is walking outside, she calls him on his cell phone.\n\nKatya reveals that not only did she lie about having cancer, (the diary Peders believed was hers was actually the diary of the character she played) but she has Peders' confessional tape. She inquires whether she should send it to his editor first or the police.  Peders smugly retorts that he swapped the tape first; Katya disagrees and says he only has her rehearsal tape.\nThe movie ends with Peders and Katya watching their tapes - Peders wearing a sullen expression. Katya sips a glass of [[wine]] while watching Peders' confessional tape, but it is unknown if she will follow through with her threat.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Steve Buscemi]] as Pierre Peders\n* [[Sienna Miller]] as Katya\n* [[Danny Schechter]] as Maitre\u2019D\n* Michael Buscemi as Robert Peders\n* [[Tara Elders]] as Maggie\n* Molly Griffith as Waitress\n* Philippe Vonlanthen as Autographer Seeker\n* [[Craig muMs Grant]] as Cab Driver\n* [[James Franco]] as Boyfriend on Phone\n* [[Katja Schuurman]] as Limo Lady\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{refbegin}}\n* [http://www.interviewthefilm.com ''Interview''] Official website\n*{{IMDb title|0480269|Interview}}\n*{{Amg movie|381507|Interview}}\n*{{rotten-tomatoes|id=10007916_interview|title=Interview}}\n{{refend}}\n\n{{Steve Buscemi}}\n\n[[Category:2007 films]]\n[[Category:2007 drama films]]\n[[Category:American drama films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Steve Buscemi]]\n[[Category:Sony Pictures Classics films]]\n[[Category:Films shot in New York (state)]]\n[[Category:American remakes of Dutch films]]\n[[Category:Two-handers]]\n[[Category:2000s English-language films]]\n[[Category:2000s American films]]"}]}}}}
