The film was co-produced and released by [[DreamWorks Pictures]] and [[Universal Pictures]]. DreamWorks Pictures distributed the film in North America while Universal Pictures released it internationally through [[United International Pictures]]. It stars [[Russell Crowe]], [[Joaquin Phoenix]], [[Connie Nielsen]], [[Ralf Moeller|Ralf M\u00f6ller]], [[Oliver Reed]] (in his final role), [[Djimon Hounsou]], [[Derek Jacobi]], [[John Shrapnel]], [[Richard Harris]], and [[Tommy Flanagan (actor)|Tommy Flanagan]]. Crowe portrays [[Roman general]] Maximus Decimus Meridius, who is betrayed when [[Commodus]], the ambitious son of Emperor [[Marcus Aurelius]], [[patricide|murders his father]] and seizes the throne. Reduced to slavery, Maximus becomes a [[gladiator]] and rises through the ranks of the arena to avenge the murders of his family and his emperor.\n\nInspired by [[Daniel P. Mannix]]'s 1958 book ''Those About to Die'' (formerly titled ''The Way of the Gladiator''), the film's script, initially written by Franzoni, was acquired by DreamWorks and Ridley Scott signed on to direct the film. Principal photography, which began in January 1999 and wrapped up in May of that year, was known to have a set of problems due to the script being unfinished. Several of the cast complained about the writing quality throughout the nineteen week shoot in [[Fort Ricasoli]], [[Malta]], forcing many rewrites. Complications of the film's production were made worse when Reed died of a heart attack before production wrapped. British post-production company [[The Mill (post-production)|The Mill]], who constructed the film's computer-generated imagery effects, had to create a digital [[body double]] for the remaining scenes involving Reed's character Proximo.\n\nOn its release, ''Gladiator'' grossed over $460.5 million worldwide, making it the [[2000 in film#Highest-grossing films|second highest-grossing film of 2000]], finishing behind ''[[Mission: Impossible 2]].'' Critics praised the acting (particularly Crowe's and Phoenix's performances), Scott's direction, visuals, screenplay, action sequences, musical score, and the production values, although it\u2019s dark and brooding tone was criticized. Winning numerous accolades, ''Gladiator'' won five [[Academy Awards]] at the [[73rd Academy Awards]], including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]] and [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] for Crowe, whose performance helped launch him to leading man status. The film also revitalized or elevated the careers of its cast and crew, particularly bringing mainstream attention to Phoenix while Scott saw his most successful film since ''[[Thelma & Louise]]'' (1991).\n\nSince its release, ''Gladiator'' has been critically reevaluated and it has been considered one of the best films of the 2000s decade, and one of the best action and historical epic films ever made. It has been credited with reinventing the [[sword-and-sandal]] genre and rekindling interest in entertainment centered around the cultures of [[culture of ancient Greece|ancient Greece]], [[culture of ancient Rome|Rome]], and other time periods throughout world history. Several films have attempted to emulate ''Gladiator''<nowiki/>'s visuals, style, and tone with varying degrees of success. The film has been analyzed for its themes of revenge, violence, masculinity, and [[stoicism]]. In 2021, Scott officially announced that writing had begun on a sequel to the film, which would formally enter development after the completion of his [[Napoleon]] [[Napoleon (upcoming film)|biopic]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Ridley Scott Says Gladiator 2 Will Be 'Ready To Go' After Napoleon Movie \u2013 Exclusive|url=https://www.empireonline.com/movies/news/ridley-scott-gladiator-2-ready-to-go-after-napoleon-exclusive/|access-date=2021-11-15|website=Empire}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nIn 180 AD, [[Hispania|Hispano-Roman]] General Maximus Decimus Meridius intends to return home after he leads the [[Roman army]] to [[Second Marcomannic War|victory against the Germanic tribes]] near [[Vindobona]] on the [[Limes Germanicus]]. Emperor [[Marcus Aurelius]] tells Maximus that his own son, [[Commodus]], is unfit to rule and that he wishes Maximus to succeed him, as regent, to help save [[Rome]] from corruption and restore the [[Roman Republic|republic]]. Upon hearing this, Commodus murders his father.\n\nCommodus proclaims himself the new emperor, asking Maximus for his loyalty, but the latter refuses. Maximus is arrested by the [[Praetorian Guard]] and is told that he and his family will die. He kills his captors and, wounded, he rides for his home near [[Trujillo, C\u00e1ceres|Trujillo]], only to find his wife and son [[crucified]]. Maximus buries them, then collapses from his injuries. Slavers find him, and take him to the city of [[Zuccabar|Zucchabar]] in the Roman province of [[Mauretania Caesariensis]], where he is sold to [[Gladiator#Schools and training|gladiator trainer]] Proximo.\n\nMaximus reluctantly fights in local tournaments, his combat skills helping him win matches and gain popularity. He befriends two other gladiators: Hagen, a [[Germanic peoples|German]]; and Juba, a [[Numidia]]n. Hagen relates he fought with Maximus in Germania, while Juba encourages him that he will meet his wife and daughter in the afterlife. Proximo reveals to Maximus that he was once a gladiator who was freed by Marcus Aurelius, and advises him to \"win the crowd\" to win his freedom.\n\nWhen Commodus organises 150 days of games to commemorate his father's death, Proximo takes his gladiators to Rome to fight in the [[Colosseum]]. Disguised in a masked helmet, Maximus debuts in the Colosseum as a [[Sacred Band of Carthage|Carthaginian]] in a re-enactment of the [[Battle of Zama]]. Unexpectedly, he leads his side to victory, and Commodus enters the Colosseum to offer his congratulations. He orders the disguised Maximus, as leader of the gladiators, to reveal his true identity; Maximus removes his helmet and declares vengeance. Commodus is compelled by the crowd to let the gladiators live, and his guards are held back from striking them down.\n\nMaximus's next fight is against a legendary undefeated gladiator, Tigris of [[Gaul]]. Commodus has arranged for several tigers to be set upon Maximus during the duel; Maximus, however, prevails. Commodus orders Maximus to kill Tigris, but Maximus spares his opponent's life; to that the crowd chants \"Maximus the Merciful\". Angered at this outcome, Commodus taunts Maximus about his family's deaths, but the latter turns and walks away.\n\nMaximus discovers from Cicero, his ex-orderly, that his former legions remain loyal. He meets in secret with [[Lucilla]], Commodus's sister and once the lover of Maximus; and Gracchus, an influential [[Senate of the Roman Empire|senator]]. They agree to have Maximus escape Rome to join his legions, topple Commodus by force, and hand power back to the [[Roman Senate]]. Commodus learns of the plot when Lucilla's son, Lucius, innocently hints at the conspiracy. Commodus threatens Lucilla and Lucius, and has the Praetorian Guard arrest Gracchus and attack the gladiators' barracks. Proximo and his men, including Hagen, sacrifice themselves to enable Maximus to escape. Maximus is captured at the rendezvous with Cicero, where the latter is killed.\n\nIn an effort to win back public approval, Commodus challenges Maximus to a duel in the Colosseum. He stabs Maximus in the lung before the match to gain an advantage. Despite his injuries, Maximus disarms Commodus, who demands a sword. Disgusted by his cowardly demeanor, the Praetorian Guard refuses to aid him. Commodus produces a hidden knife, but Maximus overpowers him and drives that same knife into Commodus's throat, killing him. Before Maximus succumbs to his wounds, he asks for political reforms, for his gladiator allies to be freed, and for Senator Gracchus to be reinstated. As he dies, he has a vision where he reunites with his wife and son. His friends and allies honor him as \"a soldier of Rome\", at Lucilla's behest, and carry his body out of the arena, leaving the dead Commodus behind.\n\nThat night, Juba visits the Colosseum and buries figurines of Maximus's wife and son at the spot where he died. He echoes Maximus' words [[Afterlife|that they will see each other again]], \"but not yet\", as he leaves to reunite with his family.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Russell Crowe]] as Maximus Decimus Meridius: A [[Hispania|Hispano-Roman]] [[legatus]] forced into becoming a slave who seeks revenge against Commodus. He has earned the favor of Marcus Aurelius, and the love and admiration of Lucilla prior to the events of the film.

Even as I went east, going through Turkey, I began to think to myself this must have been a hell of a franchise.\" During a stop in [[Baghdad]], [[Iraq]], he stoped reading a book about the [[Irish Rebellion of 1798|Irish Revolution]] for another one: [[Daniel P. Mannix]]'s 1958 novel ''Those About to Die.'' These trips helped Franzoni inspire many ideas about a story set in the [[Roman Empire]].\n\nTwenty-five years later, Franzoni wrote the screenplay for [[Steven Spielberg]]'s ''[[Amistad (film)|Amistad]],'' which was the director's first film for [[DreamWorks Pictures]], for which Speilberg was one of the three founders of the newly created independent studio. Though ''Amistad'' was a moderate commercial success, DreamWorks was impressed with Franzoni's screenplay and given him a three-picture deal as writer and co-producer. Remembering his 1972 trip, Franzoni pitched his Roman History idea to Spielberg, who immediately told him to write the script.<ref name=\"yahoo.com\"/>\n\nIn Franzoni's first draft, dated April 4, 1998, Franzoni chose to base his story on Commodus after reading the ancient Roman ''[[Historia Augusta]]''.

Livius is in love with Lucilla and seeks to marry her while Maximus, who is happily married, was formerly in love with her. Both films portray the death of Marcus Aurelius as an assassination. In ''The Fall of the Roman Empire'' a group of conspirators independent of Commodus, hoping to profit from Commodus's accession, arrange for Marcus Aurelius to be poisoned; in ''Gladiator'' Commodus himself murders his father by smothering him. In the course of ''The Fall of the Roman Empire'' Commodus unsuccessfully seeks to win Livius over to his vision of empire in contrast to that of his father, but continues to employ him notwithstanding; in ''Gladiator'', when Commodus fails to secure Maximus's allegiance, he executes Maximus's wife and son and tries unsuccessfully to execute him. Livius in ''The Fall of the Roman Empire'' and Maximus in ''Gladiator'' kill Commodus in single combat, Livius to save Lucilla and Maximus to avenge the murder of his wife and son, and both do it for the greater good of Rome.\n\nScott cited ''Spartacus'' and ''[[Ben-Hur (1959 film)|Ben-Hur]]'' as influences on the film: \"These movies were part of my cinema-going youth. But at the dawn of the new millennium, I thought this might be the ideal time to revisit what may have been the most important period of the last two thousand years&nbsp;\u2013 if not all recorded history&nbsp;\u2013 the apex and beginning of the decline of the greatest military and political power the world has ever known.\"{{sfn|Landau |Parkes |Logan |Scott |2000|p=28}}\n\n''Spartacus'' provides the film's gladiatorial motif, as well as the character of Senator Gracchus, a fictitious senator (bearing the name of a [[Gracchi|pair of revolutionary]] [[tribune]]s from the 2nd century BC) who in both films is an elder statesman of [[ancient Rome]] attempting to preserve the ancient rights of the Roman Senate in the face of an ambitious [[Autocracy|autocrat]]&nbsp;\u2013 [[Marcus Licinius Crassus]] in ''Spartacus'' and Commodus in ''Gladiator.'' Both actors who played Gracchus (in ''Spartacus'' and ''Gladiator'') played [[Claudius]] in previous films: [[Charles Laughton]] of ''Spartacus'' played Claudius in the unfinished 1937 film ''[[I, Claudius (film)|I, Claudius]]'' and Derek Jacobi of ''Gladiator'' played Claudius in [[I, Claudius (TV series)|the 1976 BBC adaptation]]. Both films also share a specific set piece wherein a gladiator (Maximus here, [[Woody Strode]]'s Draba in ''Spartacus'') throws his weapon into a spectator box at the end of a match, as well as at least one line of dialogue: \"Rome is the mob\", said here by Gracchus and by [[Julius Caesar]] ([[John Gavin]]) in ''Spartacus''.\n\n== Filming ==\n\n=== Principal photography ===\nThe film was shot in three main locations between January and May 1999.

In a 2010 interview with ''[[GQ]]'', Crowe stated that he \"never got on with Ollie. He has visited me in dreams and asked me to talk kindly of him. So I should... but we never had a pleasant conversation.\" Crowe was uncomfortable with Reed's excessive drinking during filming. Phoenix was initially anxious about filming and requested Scott he dropped out early, but to help calm a then 25-year-old Phoenix's nerves, Crowe and Harris decided to get him drunk. \"It was actually Richard Harris' idea,\" Crowe later recalled, \"because Joaquin was very nervous on the set and I went to Richard and said, 'Mate, what are we gonna do with this kid, he's asking me to abuse him before takes.'\"<ref>{{Cite web |date=2021-04-07 |title=Are You Not Entertained By These 20 Secrets About Gladiator? |url=https://www.eonline.com/news/1148513/are-you-not-entertained-by-these-20-secrets-about-gladiator |access-date=2022-09-05 |website=E!

[[William Nicholson (writer)|William Nicholson]] was brought to [[Shepperton Studios]] to make Maximus a more sensitive character. Nicholson reworked Maximus' friendship with Juba and developed the afterlife thread in the film, saying, \"he did not want to see a film about a man who wanted to kill somebody.\"<ref name=\"scribes\" /> The screenplay faced many rewrites and revisions, with several actors providing changes.<ref name=\"Variety2020\">{{cite web |last1=Nichols |first1=Mackenzie |date=4 May 2020 |title='Gladiator' at 20: Russell Crowe and Ridley Scott Look Back on the Groundbreaking Historical Epic |url=https://variety.com/2020/film/news/gladiator-20th-anniversary-russell-crowe-ridley-scott-joaquin-phoenix-1234590906/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200620031306/https://variety.com/2020/film/news/gladiator-20th-anniversary-russell-crowe-ridley-scott-joaquin-phoenix-1234590906/ |archive-date=20 June 2020 |website=Variety |language=en}}</ref> Crowe questioned every aspect of the evolving script and strode off the set when he did not get answers. According to Nicholson, Crowe reportedly told him that his \"lines are garbage, but I'm the greatest actor in the world and I can make even garbage sound good.\"\n\nAccording to a DreamWorks executive, Crowe \"tried to rewrite the entire script on the spot. You know the big line in the trailer, 'In this life or the next, I will have my vengeance'?

Even the character didn't exist on the pages. And that set about a long process, that's probably the first time that I've been in a situation where the script wasn't a complete done deal. We actually started shooting with about 32 pages and went through them in the first couple of weeks.\"<ref name=\"kaspinet.com\" /> Of the writing and filming process, Crowe added, \"Possibly, a lot of the stuff that I have to deal with now in terms of my 'volatility' has to do with that experience. Here was a situation where we got to Morocco with a crew of 200 and a cast of a 100 or whatever, and I didn't have anything to learn. I actually didn't know what the scenes were gonna be. We had, I think, one American writer working on it, one English writer working on it, and of course a group of producers who were also adding their ideas, and then Ridley himself; and then, on the occasion where Ridley would say, 'Look, this is the structure for it\u2013 what are you gonna say in that?' So then I'd be doing my own stuff, as well. And this is how things like, 'Strength and honor,' came up. This is how things like, 'At my signal, unleash hell,' came up.

Detailing the impact filming had on his body during his appearance on ''Inside the Actor's Studio,'' Crowe described that there were a \"lot of blood, lot of blood, lot of grazes, you know, I mean, I've still got, a lot of little scar[s] here and one under here on this elbow, a discoloration of the skin that is directly to Gladiator\".<ref>{{Cite web |last=Bricker |first=Tierney |date=2021-04-07 |title=Are You Not Entertained By These 20 Secrets About Gladiator? |url=https://www.eonline.com/news/1148513/are-you-not-entertained-by-these-20-secrets-about-gladiator |access-date=2022-10-14 |website=E!

The company was responsible for such tricks as compositing real tigers filmed on [[Chroma key|bluescreen]] into the fight sequences, and adding smoke trails and extending the flight paths of the opening scene's salvo of flaming arrows to get around regulations on how far they could be shot during filming. They also used 2,000 live actors to create a computer-generated crowd of 35,000 virtual actors that had to look believable and react to fight scenes.{{sfn|Landau |Parkes |Logan |Scott |2000|p=89}} The Mill accomplished this by shooting live actors at different angles giving various performances, and then mapping them onto cards, with [[motion capture|motion-capture tools]] used to track their movements for three-dimensional compositing.<ref name=TheMill/> The Mill created over 90 visual effects shots, comprising approximately nine minutes of the film's running time.{{sfn|Landau |Parkes |Logan |Scott |2000|p=122}}\n\nAn unexpected post-production job was caused by the death of [[Oliver Reed]] of a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] during the filming in Malta before all his scenes had been shot.

As [[Ridley Scott]] wanted to portray Roman culture more accurately than in any previous film, he hired several historians as advisors. Nevertheless, some deviations from historical fact were made to increase interest, maintain narrative continuity, and for practical or safety reasons. Scott also stated that due to the influence of previous films affecting the public perception of what ancient Rome was like, some historical facts were \"too unbelievable\" to include. For instance, in an early version of the script, gladiators would have been carrying out [[Testimonial|product endorsements]] in the arena; while this would have been historically accurate, it was not filmed for fear that audiences would think it anachronistic.<ref>[http://au.movies.ign.com/articles/035/035289p1.html Not Such a Wonderful Life: A Look at History in Gladiator] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080627225537/http://au.movies.ign.com/articles/035/035289p1.html |date=2008-06-27 }} IGN movies February 10, 2000</ref>\n\nAt least one historical advisor resigned due to these changes. Another asked not to be mentioned in the credits (though it was stated in the director's commentary that he constantly asked, \"where is the proof that certain things were exactly like they say?\"). Historian Allen Ward of the University of Connecticut believed that historical accuracy would not have made ''Gladiator'' less interesting or exciting, stating, \"creative artists need to be granted some poetic license, but that should not be a permit for the wholesale disregard of facts in historical fiction\".{{sfn|Winkler|2004|p=6}}<ref name=\"Ward\">{{cite web|last =Ward|first =Allen|date =May 2001|title =The Movie \"Gladiator\" in Historical Perspective|work =[[University of Connecticut]]|url =http://ablemedia.com/ctcweb/showcase/wardgladiator1.html|access-date =December 8, 2010|archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20130513100700/http://ablemedia.com/ctcweb/showcase/wardgladiator1.html|archive-date =2013-05-13|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Fictionalization===\n* [[Marcus Aurelius]] was not murdered by his son Commodus; he died at [[Vindobona]] (modern [[Vienna]]) in 180 AD from the [[Antonine Plague]].

The real Aurelius did ban games, but only in [[Antioch]] as punishment for the city's support of the usurper [[Avidius Cassius]]. No games were ever banned in Rome.

Some of the soldiers wear [[Galea (helmet)|fantasy helmets]]. The bands wrapped around their lower arms were rarely worn. Their appearance is the product of a filmic stereotype whereby historical films depict peoples of antiquity wearing such bands. Although the film is set within the 2nd century AD, the [[Lorica segmentata|Imperial Gallic armor]] and the [[Imperial helmet#Imperial Gallic|helmets]] worn by the legionaries are from AD 75, a century earlier. This was superseded by [[Imperial helmet#Imperial Italic|new designs]] in AD 100.

Throughout the film, Maximus' character arc is revolved around the theme of revenge towards Commodus for betraying him, arranging the deaths of his wife and son, and the death of his emperor. Writing in the chapter \"''Gladiator'' and Contemporary American Society\" of her book ''Big Screen Rome'', Monica S. Cyrino argues that Maximus' revenge arc is driven by the alienation of Roman politics.<ref name=\":02\">{{Cite book |last=Cyrino |first=Monica |title=Big Rome |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell |date=December 2, 2005 |isbn=978-1405116848 |location=New Mexico |pages=124\u2013149 |language=English}}</ref> Cyrino analyzes that Maximus is introduced with having patriotism and being one who \"fights for an ideal Rome because, never having been to the city. he has remained undefiled by the reality that Rome is rightful conqueror and civilizing force over the world.\"<sup>[</sup><ref name=\":02\" /> Maximus is soon betrayed by Commodus and \"when finds his wife and son mur\u00addered, it marked the moment of his alienation from everything he once valued.\"<ref name=\":02\" /> Cyrino who noted that \"Maximus' alienation from a degenerate Rome and his deep-seated ambivalence about his role in restoring Roman government to the people suggests a parallel to [[Post\u2013Cold War era|post-Cold War]] America.\"<ref name=\":02\" /> Cyrino also notes that even as there was a \"temporary boost in the rhetoric of national unity and superficial displays of patri\u00adotism after [[September 11 attacks|September 11, 2001]], current political and social commenta\u00adtors remark on the apathy of the American electorate, such as low voter turnout and a persistent lack of interest in political debate.\"<ref name=\":02\" /> When Maximus returns to Rome as a slave, \"he eventually realizes what he has already begun to understand: \"The mob is Rome.\"\"<ref name=\":02\" /> Driven by his anger and isolation, Mamimus;' resolution is to re-enact his ideal of Rome from within the arena. After he kills Commodus before he succumbs to his wounds, Maximus asks Quintus to reinstate Senator Gracchus in the hope that Gracchus helps reinstate [[Marcus Aurelius]]' ideals.\n\n=== Violence as spectacle ===\n''Gladiator'' commentates on theme of violence in sports and as a spectacle for entertainment. Cyrino writes that \"''Gladiator'' evokes the influence of the superstar athlete in a child's wide-eyed worship of celebrity when young Lucius approaches Maximus, his new idol. as he waits in his cell to enter the arena.\"<sup>[</sup><ref name=\":02\" /> Franzoni himself was inspired by various sporting agents and professional sports such as the [[National Football League|NFL]] and [[WWE]] when writing the script.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Campbell |first=Christopher |date=2020-05-06 |title=The Legacy of 'Gladiator' |url=https://filmschoolrejects.com/the-legacy-of-gladiator/ |access-date=2022-10-09 |website=Film School Rejects |language=en-US}}</ref> Cyrino blieves that the film's \"gladiatorial fights are reminiscent of the way in which con\u00adtemporary sports competitions, especially professional football and wrestling, are filmed for television,\" and that Logan employed a similar tactic for the screenplay for [[Oliver Stone]]'s ''[[Any Given Sunday]]'' (1999), where \"the camera watches from a series of vantage points that are easily recognizable to any viewers of [[Monday Night Football]].\"<ref name=\":02\" /> Cyrino argues that the film deconstructs from the spectacle of violence through the lens of Maximus. After a victory in [[Zuccabar|Zucchabar]], Maximus throws his sword at the local viewing box and spits at the sand after displaying his contempt for the crowd. Cyrino argues that \"the depiction of the Roman mob in Gladiator offers the American audience an unnerving mirror-image of themselves, eager to be entertained at all costs and demanding ever more intricate, dangerous, and realistic spectacles.\"<ref name=\":02\" />\n\n=== Masculinity and stoicism ===\nThemes of masculinity and stoicism are commentated throughout the film's plot. During the course of the film, Maximus is represented as a strong, fearless figure who is brave, loyal, and honest to those around him. Cyrino writes that Maximus' masculinity is defined through his upbringing as a farmer and a working-class hero.<ref name=\":02\" /> A signature trait from Maximus before he fights is that he gets dirt from the ground and wipe his hands dirty with them, signaling his personality as a man who isn't afraid to get his hands dirty. Cyrino states that Maximus' portrayal as \"a simple man of the soil responds to modern society's idealization of the countryside and its supposed virtue and purity, in stark contrast to the crime-ridden metropolis.\"<ref name=\":02\" /> Maximus gains the support of his fellow gladiators and some of the senate over the course of the film through the way he behaves and acts. Some philosophers have noted the role [[stoicism]] plays in the Maximus' masculinity. The real life [[Marcus Aurelius]] writes in ''Meditations'' that stoics must \"concentrate on [their responsibilities] ... without getting stirred up or meeting anger with angers.\" Maximus' drive for vengeance has made him turn away from his responsibilities of a role model to his son until Lucilla confronts him in his cell that he realizes that his emotions are getting the better of him. When Commodus taunts Maximus about how his son \"squealed like a girl when they nailed him to the cross,\" stoicism shines a light on Maximus by refusing to give into his anger and kill Commodus in front of the arena and resorts to telling Commodus that his \"time for honoring himself will soon be at a end.\" Krysta Larson, writing in \"Mother Knows Best? Evaluating the Roles of Stoic Parents in ''Gladiator'',\" believed that \"it were stoically proper to continue in one\u2019s role as a parent to a dead son, then Maximus would fulfill his role as a good Stoic father by pursuing virtuous goals and properly performing the deeds dictated by his roles rather than seeking revenge.\"<ref>{{Cite book |last=Larson |first=Krysta |title=Mother Knows Best? Evaluating the Roles of Stoic Parents in Gladiator (2000) |publisher=Creighton University |year=2015 |pages=17}}</ref>\n\nCommodus, on the other hand, is presented as the antithesis of Maximus. The film portrays Commodus as an immature, cowardly, and unreasonable man who is not fit for the demands of governing the Roman Empire. He openly complains, sobs, has trouble sleeping at night, and has no respect from neither of the characters in the film. The film characterizes Commodus with his sister as his only friend, with his father openly admitting that his son is not a moral son. Driven by the lack of love obtained from his father, Commodus is \"keen to acquire the love and respect of the Roman people that his father had enjoyed but criticizes Marcus Aurelius for his intellectualism.\"<ref name=\":02\" /> Cyrino compared Commodus to the presidency of [[George W. Bush]], stating that like Commodus, \"Bush employed rhetoric imbued with overly emotional and sometimes childish tones.\"<ref name=\":02\" /> Both Commodus and Bush, according to Cyrino, are \"con\u00adtemptuous of guidance from advisory councils and express their scorn by means of anti-intellectual bluster.\"<ref name=\":02\" /> Commodus amoral persoanlity intensfies when he begins to lust after his own sister Lucilia and forces her to become his sex slave as punishment for her betrayal. ''Gladiator'' highlights the distinct personalities of Maximus and Commodus in the final battle, where Maximus' honor, determination, and discipline overcomes Commodus' vanity, cruelty, and ambition.\n\nThe film's depiction of Commodus's entry into Rome borrows imagery from [[Leni Riefenstahl]]'s [[Nazism|Nazi]] propaganda film ''[[Triumph of the Will]]'' (1935), although Scott has pointed out that the [[iconography]] of Nazi rallies was itself inspired by the Roman Empire. ''Gladiator'' reflects back on the film by duplicating similar events that occurred in [[Adolf Hitler]]'s procession. The Nazi film opens with an aerial view of Hitler arriving in a plane, while Scott shows an aerial view of Rome, quickly followed by a shot of the large crowd of people watching Commodus pass them in a procession with his [[chariot]].114{{sfn|Winkler|2004|p=114}} The first thing to appear in ''Triumph of the Will'' is a Nazi eagle, which is alluded to when a statue of an eagle sits atop one of the arches (and then is shortly followed by several more decorative eagles throughout the rest of the scene), leading up to the procession of Commodus. At one point in the Nazi film, a little girl gives flowers to Hitler, while Commodus is met by several girls who all give him bundles of flowers.{{sfn|Winkler|2004|p=115}}\n\n== Legacy ==\n\n=== Cultural Impact ===\n[[File:MF Doom - Hultsfred 2011 (cropped).jpg|thumb|The mask worn by Maximus in ''Gladiator'' became the basis for the signature mask for British-American rapper [[MF Doom]].]]\nPrior to the release of ''Gladiator'', the [[Sword-and-sandal|swords and sandal]] genre had fallen out of public popularity by the mid-1960s following a string of expensive box office flops such as ''[[Cleopatra (1963 film)|Cleopatra]]'' (1963) and ''[[The Fall of the Roman Empire (film)|The Fall of the Roman Empire]]'' (1964).<ref>{{Cite book |last=Shahabudin and Blanshard |first=Kim and Alastair |title=Classics on Screen: Ancient Greece and Rome on Film |publisher=Bristol Classical Press |year=2011 |isbn=978-0715637241 |pages=216\u2013234 |language=English}}</ref> In the 1990s, the [[Epic film|historical epic]] genre saw a revival in popularity thanks to the success of films such as ''[[Dances with Wolves|Dances With Wolves]]'' (1990), ''[[Schindler's List]]'' (1993), ''[[Braveheart]]'' (1995), ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]'' (1997), and ''[[Saving Private Ryan]]'' (1998).<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web |last=Campbell |first=Christopher |date=2020-05-06 |title=The Legacy of 'Gladiator' |url=https://filmschoolrejects.com/the-legacy-of-gladiator/ |access-date=2022-11-04 |website=Film School Rejects |language=en-US}}</ref> ''Gladiator'' continued these films' realism with a more focus on the [[Ancient history|Ancient History]], which has not been explored extensively since the 1960s.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nRetrospective reviews and film critics have noted that ''Gladiator''<nowiki/>'s success began a revival of the historical epic genre with films during the 2000s such as ''[[The Last Samurai]]'', ''[[Troy (film)|Troy]]'', ''[[The Alamo (2004 film)|The Alamo]]'', ''[[King Arthur (2004 film)|King Arthur]]'', ''[[Alexander (2004 film)|Alexander]]'', ''[[300 (film)|300]]'' and its sequel ''[[300: Rise of an Empire]]'', ''[[Kingdom of Heaven (film)|Kingdom of Heaven]]'', and ''[[Robin Hood (2010 film)|Robin Hood]]'' (the last two were also directed by Scott).<ref name=\"Ref_2004\">{{Cite magazine |title=The 15 Most Influential Films of Our Lifetime |date=June 2004 |page=115 |magazine=[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]}}</ref> The gladiator arena set piece from the 2002 film ''[[Star Wars: Episode II\u00a0\u2013 Attack of the Clones]]'', which entered production shortly after the release of ''Gladiator'', has been compared to the arena setting in the Scott film.<ref>{{cite magazine |author=Todd McCarthy |date=May 8, 2002 |title=Star Wars: Episode II&nbsp;\u2013 Attack of the Clones |url=https://variety.com/2002/film/reviews/star-wars-episode-ii-attack-of-the-clones-1200549814/ |url-status=live |magazine=Variety |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180921112028/https://variety.com/2002/film/reviews/star-wars-episode-ii-attack-of-the-clones-1200549814/ |archive-date=2018-09-21 |access-date=May 31, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |author=Anthony Quinn |date=May 16, 2002 |title=The Big Picture: Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones (PG) |newspaper=The Independent |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/reviews/the-big-picture-star-wars-episode-ii-attack-of-the-clones-pg-9150797.html |url-status=live |access-date=May 31, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181010060628/https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/reviews/the-big-picture-star-wars-episode-ii-attack-of-the-clones-pg-9150797.html |archive-date=2018-10-10}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |date=July 8, 2010 |title=Mr. Plinkett's Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones Review |url=http://redlettermedia.com/mr-plinketts-star-wars-episode-ii-attack-of-the-clones-review/ |access-date=May 31, 2018 |website=RedLetterMedia.com}}{{Dead link|date=August 2021|bot=InternetArchiveBot|fix-attempted=yes}}</ref> While a majority of these films were critically and commercially successful in their own rights, ''[[The Guardian]]''<nowiki/>'s Steve Rose argued that the historical epic revival devolved back into parody by 2007, as none of the films recapture the impact of ''Gladiator''.
