The story centers on a man whose best friend is a [[P\u00faca|pooka]] named [[Harvey (name)|Harvey]], a {{cvt|6|ft|3+1/2|in|m|2|adj=mid|}} tall white invisible rabbit, and the ensuing debacle when the man's sister tries to have him committed to a sanatorium.\n\n==Plot==\nElwood P. Dowd is an amiable but eccentric man whose best friend is an invisible, {{cvt|6|ft|3+1/2|in|m|2|adj=mid|-tall}} white [[rabbit]] named Harvey. As described by Elwood, Harvey is a [[P\u00faca|pooka]], a benign but mischievous creature from [[Celtic mythology]]. Elwood spends most of his time taking Harvey around town, drinking at various bars and introducing Harvey to almost every person he meets, much to the puzzlement of strangers, though Elwood's friends have accepted Harvey's (supposed) existence. His older sister Veta and his niece Myrtle Mae live with him in his large estate, but have become social outcasts along with Elwood due to his obsession with Harvey.\n\nAfter Elwood ruins a party Veta and Myrtle Mae had arranged in secret, Veta finally tries to have him committed to a local [[sanatorium]]. In exasperation she admits to the attending [[psychiatrist]], Dr. Lyman Sanderson, that she sees Harvey every once in a while herself. Mistaking Veta as the real mental case, Sanderson has Elwood released and Veta locked up. Dr. Chumley, head of the sanatorium, discovers the mistake and realizes he must bring Elwood back, searching the town with [[orderly]] Marvin Wilson. With Veta's help, Chumley eventually tracks Elwood to his favorite bar, \"Charlie's\", and decides to confront him alone.\n\nFour hours later, Marvin returns to the sanatorium, but learns from Sanderson and nurse Kelly that Chumley has not returned with Elwood. They arrive at Charlie's and find Elwood alone; he explains that Chumley had wandered off with Harvey after several rounds of drinks. When asked, Elwood explains that he met Harvey one night several years ago after escorting a drunk friend to a taxi, and they had since enjoyed going to bars and socializing with other patrons to hear their grand life stories and aspirations. Convinced Elwood is insane and may have harmed Chumley, Marvin calls the police and has Elwood escorted back to the sanatorium.\n\nChumley returns to the sanatorium disheveled and paranoid, and is followed by an invisible presence. When the others arrive, Chumley invites Elwood to his office. In private, Chumley says that he now knows Harvey is real, and Elwood explains Harvey's various powers, including his ability to stop time, send anyone to any destination for as long as they like, and then bring them back without a minute passing. Chumley explains how he would spend two weeks in [[Akron]]. Veta arrives with Judge Gaffney and Myrtle Mae, prepared to commit Elwood, but are convinced by Sanderson that an injection of a serum called \"Formula 977\" will stop Elwood from \"seeing the rabbit\".\n\nAs they prepare the injection, Veta tries to pay the cab driver but, emptying her purse, is unable to find her smaller coin purse. She interrupts the injection procedure and asks Elwood to pay the driver. Warmed by Elwood's kindness, the cab driver explains how he has driven many people to the sanatorium to receive the same medicine and then driven them back, warning Veta that Elwood will soon become \"a perfectly normal human being, and you know what stinkers they are.\" Veta is upset by this, and halts the injection; she then finds her coin purse back within her purse, and realizes that Harvey had intervened to save her brother.\n\nLeaving with Veta and Myrtle Mae, Elwood sees Harvey on the porch swing. Harvey decides to stay with Chumley so that he can take him on his fantasy trip to Akron. Elwood walks out the gates dejected, but when the gates close he suddenly sees that Harvey is returning to him. The gate switch is pulled open by an unseen force, and Elwood says, \"I prefer you too, Harvey\" as they follow Veta and Myrtle Mae into the sunrise.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[James Stewart]] as Elwood P.

[[Bosley Crowther]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote that \"so freely flowing is the screenplay which Mrs. Chase and Oscar Brodney have prepared, so vivid and droll is the direction which Henry Koster has given it and, particularly, so darling is the acting of James Stewart, Josephine Hull and all the rest that a virtually brand new experience is still in store for even those who saw the play.\"<ref>{{cite journal |last=Crowther |first=Bosley |date=December 22, 1950 |title=The Screen In Review |journal=[[The New York Times]] |page=19 }}</ref> ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' wrote that the play \"loses little of its whimsical comedy charm in the screen translation\", and that Stewart \"would seem the perfect casting for the character so well does he convey the idea that escape from life into a pleasant half-world existence has many points in its favor.\"<ref>{{cite journal |date=October 18, 1950 |title=Harvey |journal=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |page=6 }}</ref> ''[[Harrison's Reports]]'' wrote, \"A brief synopsis cannot do justice to the humor in the story, much of it delightful and some of it hilarious.
