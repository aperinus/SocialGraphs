The film tells the story of a bullied 12-year-old boy who develops a friendship with a strange child in [[Blackeberg]], a suburb of [[Stockholm]], in the early 1980s.\n \nA film adaptation of Lindqvist's novel began development in 2004 when John Nordling acquired the rights to produce the project. Alfredson, unconcerned with the [[Horror film|horror]] and [[Vampire films|vampire conventions]], decided to tone down many elements of the novel and focus primarily on the relationship between the two main characters and explore the darker side of humanity. Selecting the lead actors involved a year-long process with open castings held all over Sweden. In the end, [[K\u00e5re Hedebrant]] and [[Lina Leandersson]] were chosen for the leading roles. Leandersson's role in the film was dubbed by Elif Caylan. [[Principal photography]] took place in 2007 in [[Lule\u00e5]], with additional filming in Blackeberg. The film was produced by EFTI, [[Sveriges Television]] and Filmpool Nord, with support from the [[Swedish Film Institute]], [[Nordisk Film|Nordisk Film & TV Fond]], WAG and [[Canal+]].\n\n''Let the Right One In'' premiered at the [[Gothenburg Film Festival]] on 26 January 2008, where it received the Nordic Film Prize. It was released in Sweden on 24 October 2008 by [[Sandrew Metronome]]. The film received critical acclaim, with praise for the performances of the two leads, the cinematography, screenplay, and direction. It won several awards, including the Founders Award for Best Narrative Feature at the [[Tribeca Film Festival]], as well as four [[44th Guldbagge Awards|Guldbagge Awards]], including [[Guldbagge Award for Best Director|Best Director]] for Alfredson, [[Guldbagge Award for Best Cinematography|Best Cinematography]] for Van Hoytema, and [[Guldbagge Award for Best Screenplay|Best Screenplay]] for Lindqvist. It also won the [[Saturn Award for Best International Film]] and the [[Empire Award for Best Horror|Empire Award for Best Horror Film]]. At the [[63rd British Academy Film Awards]], the film was nominated for [[Best Film Not in the English Language]]. An American [[remake]], titled ''[[Let Me In (film)|Let Me In]]'' and directed by [[Matt Reeves]], was released in 2010.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be set between 400 to 700 words.

See the talk page before attempting to correct this. -->\nOskar, a meek 12-year-old boy, resides with his mother Yvonne in the western [[Stockholm]] suburb of [[Blackeberg]] in 1982. His classmates regularly [[Bullying|bully]] him, and he spends his evenings imagining revenge, collecting clippings from newspapers and magazines about murders. One night he meets Eli, who appears to be a pale girl of his age. Eli has recently moved into the next-door apartment with an older man, H\u00e5kan. Eli initially informs Oskar that they cannot be friends. Over time, however, the two begin to form a relationship, and exchange [[Morse code]] messages through their adjoining wall. Eli learns that Oskar is being bullied by schoolmates and encourages him to stand up for himself. Oskar enrolls in weight-training classes after school.\n\nEarlier, H\u00e5kan stops and kills a passerby on a footpath to harvest blood for Eli, but is interrupted by an approaching dog walker. Eli is prompted to waylay and kill a local man, Jocke, making his way home after having said goodnight to his best friend, Lacke. A cat-loving recluse, G\u00f6sta, witnesses the attack from his flat but, in disbelief, decides not to report the incident. H\u00e5kan hides Jocke's body in an ice-hole in the local lake. H\u00e5kan makes another effort to obtain blood for Eli by trapping a teenage boy in a changing room after school. When he is about to be discovered by the boy's friends, H\u00e5kan pours concentrated [[hydrochloric acid]] onto his own face, disfiguring it to prevent the authorities from identifying him. Eli visits H\u00e5kan in the hospital; H\u00e5kan offers his neck to Eli for feeding, and Eli drains him of his blood. Eli goes to Oskar's apartment and spends the night with him, during which time they agree to \"go steady\", though Eli states, \"I'm not a girl\".\n\nDuring an ice skating [[field trip]] at the lake, some of Oskar's fellow students discover Jocke's body. At the same time, the bullies again harass Oskar, who hits their leader Conny in the head with a metal pole, splitting his ear. Sometime later, unaware that Eli is a vampire, Oskar suggests that he and Eli form a [[Blood brother|blood bond]], and cuts his hand, asking Eli to do the same. Eli, thirsting for blood but not wanting to harm Oskar, laps up his blood before running away. Lacke's girlfriend, Virginia, is subsequently attacked by Eli. Virginia survives but discovers that she has become painfully sensitive to sunlight. Virginia visits G\u00f6sta, only to be fiercely attacked by G\u00f6sta's cats. Soon after this, Oskar confronts Eli, who admits to being a vampire. Oskar is initially upset by Eli's need to kill people for survival. However, Eli insists that they are alike, in that Oskar wants to kill and Eli needs to kill, and encourages Oskar to \"be me, for a little while.\"\n\nIn the hospital, Virginia asks an orderly to open the blinds in her room. When the sunlight streams in, Virginia bursts into flames. Lacke tracks Eli down to the apartment. Breaking in, he discovers Eli asleep in the bathtub. He prepares to kill Eli, but Oskar interferes; Eli wakes up, jumps on Lacke and feeds on his blood, killing him. Eli thanks Oskar and kisses him. However, an upstairs neighbor is angrily knocking on the ceiling due to the disturbance. Eli realizes that it is not safe to stay and leaves that night.\n\nThe next morning, Oskar is lured out to resume the after-school fitness program at the local swimming pool. The bullies, led by Conny and his older brother Jimmy, start a fire to draw Mr \u00c1vila, the supervising teacher, outside. They enter the pool area and order the children, aside from Oskar, to clear out. Jimmy forces Oskar under the water, threatening to stab his eye out if he does not hold his breath for three minutes. While Oskar is being held underwater, Eli arrives and rescues him by killing and dismembering the bullies, except for the most reluctant of their number, Andreas, who is left sobbing on a bench.\n\nLater, Oskar is traveling on a train with Eli in a box beside him. From inside, Eli taps the word \"kiss\" to Oskar in Morse code, to which he taps back \"small kiss\".{{efn|[[Swedish language|Swedish]]: ''puss''; specifically a small or brief kiss, usually with a closed mouth.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://consequenceofsound.net/2017/05/in-2008-let-the-right-one-in-depicted-teenage-love-as-bloodlust/|title=In 2008, Let the Right One In Depicted Teenage Love as Bloodlust|last=Colburn|first=Randall|date=9 May 2017|website=[[Consequence of Sound]]|access-date=4 August 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thelocal.se/20190214/swedish-word-of-the-day-puss|title=Swedish word of the day: puss|last=Edwards|first=Catherine|date=14 February 2019|website=[[TheLocal.se]]|access-date=4 August 2020}}</ref>}}\n\n==Cast==\n{{Main|List of Let the Right One In characters}}\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[K\u00e5re Hedebrant]] as [[List of characters from Let the Right One In and Let Me In#Oskar or Owen|Oskar]]\n* [[Lina Leandersson]] as [[List of characters from Let the Right One In and Let Me In#Eli or Abby|Eli]]\n** Elif Ceylan as Eli (Voice)\n** Susanne Ruben as Aged Eli\n* [[Per Ragnar]] as [[List of characters from Let the Right One In and Let Me In#H\u00e5kan or \"The Father\"|H\u00e5kan]]\n* Henrik Dahl as Erik\n* Karin Bergquist as Yvonne\n* [[Peter Carlberg]] as [[List of characters from Let the Right One In and Let Me In#Lacke|Lacke]]\n* [[Ika Nord]] as [[List of characters from Let the Right One In and Let Me In#Virginia|Virginia]]\n* [[Mikael Rahm]] as Jocke\n* Karl Robert Lindgren as G\u00f6sta\n* Anders T.
