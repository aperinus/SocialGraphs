The film takes an unconventional approach to the subject matter, featuring young actors \"auditioning\" for parts playing high-profile Scientologists in scenes recreating accounts from ex-members about incidents involving senior church management. The [[Church of Scientology]] responded by putting the filmmakers under surveillance and denouncing the film.\n\n''My Scientology Movie'' premiered at the [[London Film Festival]] on 14 October 2015 before receiving a [[Limited release|limited theatrical release]] in the United Kingdom on 7 October 2016 from [[BBC Films]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.myscientologymovie.film|title=My Scientology Movie|publisher=Altitude Film Distribution Ltd|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-03-17}}</ref> with a North American on 3 March 2017 from [[Magnolia Pictures]].<ref>{{cite web | url= http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=myscientologymovie.htm |title= ''My Scientology Movie'' (2017) | work=[[Box Office Mojo]] | access-date=16 October 2016}}</ref> The film received positive reviews from critics.<ref name=\"Guardian 30 September 2016\" /><ref name=\"Guardian-14-Oct-2015\" /><ref name=\"Telegraph-14-Oct-2014\" />\n\n==Synopsis==\nAfter the [[Church of Scientology]] refuses to cooperate in making a documentary, Louis Theroux teams up with former senior church official [[Mark Rathbun]] to create dramatic reconstructions of incidents within the church witnessed by Rathbun and other ex-Scientologists. They focus in particular on alleged violent behaviour by the church's leader [[David Miscavige]] at its secretive [[Gold Base]] facility in California, which Theroux visits. The church retaliates by putting Theroux and his film crew under surveillance, leading to camera-wielding confrontations with a Scientology \"squirrel buster\" team and with church officials outside Gold Base. Theroux raises questions about Rathbun's own former complicity in the church's \"terroristic\" activities, leading to tensions between the two.<ref name=\"Variety-15-Oct-2015\">{{cite news|url=https://variety.com/2015/film/festivals/my-scientology-movie-review-1201616874/|title=London Film Review: 'My Scientology Movie'|last=Lodge|first=Guy|work=Variety|date=14 October 2015|access-date=15 October 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://film.britishcouncil.org/my-scientology-movie|title=British Council Film: My Scientology Movie|date=2 October 2015|access-date=15 October 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"Halligan\" />\n\n==Development==\nTheroux had long sought to make a documentary about the Church of Scientology from the inside but was repeatedly refused by church officials. In 2011 his producer, Simon Chinn, suggested making a 90-minute feature about Scientology. Together with director John Dower, they looked for ways to make a documentary \u2013 working title ''Stairway to Heaven: Louis Theroux and the Church of Scientology''<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.screendaily.com/festivals/london/louis-theroux-scientology-doc-to-premiere-at-lff/5092319.article|title=Louis Theroux Scientology doc to premiere at LFF|last=Grater|first=Tom|work=Screen Daily|date=1 September 2015|access-date=16 September 2015}}</ref> \u2013 without access to its subjects. They wanted to avoid formulae that had been used by previous film-makers, such as interviews with ex-members intercut with archive footage and re-enactments, or an \"in search of\" approach documenting the fruitless quest to gain access. They eventually hit upon the idea of \"negative access\", illustrating the church by provoking a reaction from it.<ref name=\"Guardian-14-Oct-2015\">{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/14/louis-theroux-my-scientology-movie-i-felt-like-id-been-blooded|title=My Scientology Movie by Louis Theroux: 'I felt like I'd been blooded'|last=Theroux|first=Louis|work=The Guardian|date=14 October 2015|access-date=14 October 2015}}</ref> As Tim Robey of ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' puts it, contrasting it with the more methodical ''[[Going Clear (film)|Going Clear]]'' by [[Alex Gibney]], \"where Gibney circled the movement right from its beginnings, seeking to analyse its methods and impugn its motives, Theroux just gets right in there and jabs it in the ribs, that imperturbable mask of irony driving its partisans even more bananas than usual.\"<ref name=\"Telegraph-14-Oct-2014\">{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/film/my-scientology-movie/review/|title=My Scientology Movie review: 'gloriously funny'|last=Robey|first=Tim|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=14 October 2015|access-date=14 October 2015}}</ref>\n[[File:The Hole Gold Base.jpg|right|thumb|[[The Hole (Scientology)|The Hole]] at Gold Base, where some re-enactments in ''My Scientology Movie'' are set]]\nTheroux and his team sought to take \"inspiration from the showbusiness trappings of Scientology itself\". With the help of various actors, they recreated events related by ex-members in the church's Gold Base and its punishment facility, [[The Hole (Scientology)|The Hole]]. The ex-members who related these events helped to direct the scenes, which were filmed on soundstages in Hollywood. According to Theroux, \"this was simply a visual way of bringing people's memories to life. But it soon became clear that the re-enactments would also allow me to question and probe those former Scientologists' versions of events.\" In conjunction with the former senior Scientology official Mark Rathbun, who is now one of the church's most prominent critics, he held auditions for about 30 young actors to play parts depicting church leader [[David Miscavige]] and its most famous member, [[Tom Cruise]]. In the process, \"the documentary became a film about me trying to make the re-enactments\". Theroux took inspiration from a film that he had recently seen, [[Joshua Oppenheimer]]'s documentary ''[[The Act of Killing]]'', which featured Indonesian [[genocidaire]]s re-enacting their crimes for the camera.<ref name=\"Guardian-14-Oct-2015\"/>\n\nThe church's reaction was predicted by Theroux, who said, \"They have a habit of tailing, filming, questioning and investigating those who do stories on them.\"<ref name=\"Guardian-14-Oct-2015\"/> Within a couple of months of the start of filming, the film-makers found themselves under constant surveillance.<ref name=\"Guardian-14-Oct-2015\"/> The church mounted a campaign of harassment against the film-makers which drew \"all kinds of stalker-ish emissaries and cranks out of the woodwork, not one of them doing much to reassure us that Scientology is in fact cuddly, socially progressive or misunderstood.\" They found themselves pursued \"in broad daylight by mysterious cars with tinted windows\". Occasionally they had face-to-face confrontations with camera-toting pursuers which they filmed in turn, so that \"half the film consists of cameras pointing at other cameras, like an absurdist gunfight at dawn, with neither side willing to holster.\"<ref name=\"Telegraph-14-Oct-2014\" /> They also received numerous letters from Scientology lawyers.<ref name=\"Guardian-14-Oct-2015\"/> Theroux found this behavior very strange: \"They are behaving in a way that is so obviously pathological\u2014you would think they would realize that other people would see that and think this is a religion of lunatics.\"<ref>{{cite news|title=Ex-Scientologists: David Miscavige Is a 'Terrorist'|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/10/14/ex-scientologists-david-miscavige-is-a-terrorist.html|work=The Daily Beast|last=Hines|first=Nico|date=14 October 2015|access-date=14 October 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\nThe film was praised by ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' reviewer Tim Robey as \"a giddy, [[Monty Python|Python]]esque delight\".
