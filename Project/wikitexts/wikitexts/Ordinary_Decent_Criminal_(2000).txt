The film is loosely based on the story of [[Martin Cahill]], a famous Irish crime boss.<ref name=irish>{{cite web|title=Ordinary Decent Criminal|url=http://www.irishfilm.net/blurbs/ODC.html|publisher=The Irish in Film|access-date=24 October 2012}}</ref>\n\nFilmed in late 1998 and originally scheduled for a fall 1999 release, the movie was put out overseas first the following year but it never got a proper theatrical release in the United States, where it was released straight to video in January 2003, almost five years after filming began.\n\n== Plot ==\nMichael Lynch is one of [[Dublin]]'s most notorious criminals. He has two wives, sisters Christine and Lisa, as well as many children. When he is not spending time with his family, he is plotting heists with his gang. His actions make him an iconic figure, and he has a rapport with the general public despite being a criminal.\n\nDuring his elaborate heists, he concentrates on the showmanship as much as the crime itself. He pulls off a daring [[art theft]], stealing several priceless paintings from Dublin's best art gallery, giving the  authorities the slip. The [[Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na|Garda\u00ed]] become more determined to catch him as time goes on, in particular Noel Quigley, an officer whose ambition to catch Lynch becomes an obsession. His actions also gain the ire of the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army|IRA]].\n\nLynch finds himself in trouble when he is unable to sell a stolen [[Michelangelo Merisi da Caravaggio|Caravaggio]] painting, ''[[The Taking of Christ (Caravaggio)|The Taking of Christ]]'', giving Quigley the opportunity he was waiting for to try and catch him. Lynch is forced to go on the run, with his popularity with the public at stake.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Kevin Spacey]] as Michael Lynch\n* [[Linda Fiorentino]] as Christine Lynch\n* [[Peter Mullan]] as Stevie\n* [[Stephen Dillane]] as Noel Quigley\n* [[Helen Baxendale]] as Lisa Lynch\n* [[David Hayman]] as Tony Brady\n* [[Patrick Malahide]] as Commissioner Daly\n* [[Gerard McSorley]] as Harrison\n* [[David Kelly (actor)|David Kelly]] as Father Grogan\n* Gary Lydon as Tom Rooney\n* [[Paul Ronan]] as Billy Lynch\n* [[Colin Farrell]] as Alec\n* [[Vincent Regan]] as Shay Kirby\n* [[Tim Loane]] as Jerome Higgins\n* [[Christoph Waltz]] as Peter\n* [[Enda Oates]] as Brian\n* David Brady as Declan Brady\n* Mike Diamente as James Mason\n* Jeffrey Connon as Paul O'Keeffe\n* [[Bill Murphy (Irish Actor)|Bill Murphy]] as Detective Barry\n\n== Production ==\n{{Anchor|Development}}\nThaddeus O'Sullivan began trying to adapt the book ''The General'' by [[Paul Williams (media personality)|Paul Williams]], but abandoned a direct adaption. Having previously worked on [[Nothing Personal (TV series)|Nothing Personal]] about loyalist paramilitaries, and a [[biopic]] about John Gotti for NBC, O'Sullivan did not want to again work under the factual and legal constraints of a film based on real people, and was more interested in making a comedy or caper, and instead they developed their own story only loosely based on Martin Cahill. The original project went back on the market and John Boorman came on board as director. O'Sullivan was worried that investors might think the two projects were too similar, but after Boorman's ''[[The General (1998 film)|The General]]'' screened at Cannes people saw the films were very different and were willing to invest.<ref name=\"caper\">{{cite web |date= 9 January 2000|title= A caper through Dublin's underworld |url= https://www.independent.ie/woman/celeb-news/a-caper-through-dublins-underworld-26252880.html |website= [[Irish Independent]] |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20200223122712/https://www.independent.ie/woman/celeb-news/a-caper-through-dublins-underworld-26252880.html |archive-date= 2020-02-23 |quote= Our film cost $10m and there's no way we could get that back without a name in it. }}</ref>\n\n{{Anchor|Casting}}\nO'Sullivan would have cast more Irish actors except for Boorman's film, and said \"If his part had not been so prominent in The General, I would have had [[Se\u00e1n McGinley]] in my film.
