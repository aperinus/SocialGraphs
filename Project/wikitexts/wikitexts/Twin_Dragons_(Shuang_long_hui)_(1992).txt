Meanwhile, a dangerous gang leader named Crazy Kung ([[Kirk Wong]]) is being transported as a captive in the same hospital. Crazy Kung escapes and attempts to take one of the twins hostage, and in the ensuing chaos the twins are permanently separated. One of the twins, named Ma Yau, is taken to America by his parents and grows up to be a concert pianist and conductor. The other twin, Ma Wan, is found and raised by an alcoholic woman named Tsui ([[Mabel Cheung]]), and becomes a street racer and martial artist named Bok Min. For years, neither of them is aware that he has an identical twin brother.\n\n26 years later, the twins' ([[Jackie Chan]]) lives intersect again: Bok Min and his best friend Tarzan ([[Teddy Robin]]) get mixed up with a dangerous gang, while Ma Yau prepares to conduct a major concert in Hong Kong. In addition, the twins gain romantic interests: Bok Min meets Barbara ([[Maggie Cheung]]), a club singer Tarzan is interested in, and Yau becomes acquainted with Tong Sum ([[Nina Li Chi]]), a young woman from a respectable family who has a secret passion for fighter types. Eventually, the twins meet and discover that they [[Twin telepathy|share a strange connection]] with each other. As a result, a string of hilarious mix-ups ensues when Ma Yau is accidentally enlisted by the gangsters to participate as an escape driver in the liberation of none other than Crazy Kung; Bok Min in turn is forced to conduct Yau's concert (which becomes a smash hit despite him having absolutely no musical talent); and the two of them end up with the other's girl as their respective love interest.\n\nEventually, things come to a head when the gangsters kidnap Tarzan to make Ma Yau surrender a briefcase meant for Crazy Kung, which Ma Yau had accidentally nabbed. The twins join up to defeat the gang that has turned their lives upside down, and in a showdown in a vehicle testing center Crazy Kung dies in a runaway [[crash test]] car. The film ends with the impending double wedding of the twins to their girls and Bok Min's introduction to his real parents; but when Bok Min gets cold feet and Ma Yau goes looking for him, a final gag falls into place when the wedding guests catch the two twins together and are unable to tell them apart.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Jackie Chan]] as Ma Yau / Bok Min <small>(John Ma / Boomer in the American release)</small>\n* [[Maggie Cheung]] as Barbara\n* [[Nina Li Chi]] as Tong Sum <small>(Tammy in the American release)</small>\n*[[Teddy Robin]] as Tarzan <small>(Tyson in the American release)</small>\n* [[Anthony Chan Yau|Anthony Chan]] as hotel staffer\n* [[Philip Chan (actor)|Philip Chan]] as hotel manager Chen\n* [[Sylvia Chang]] as the twins' mother\n* [[James Wong (lyricist)|James Wong]] as the twins' father\n* [[Alfred Cheung]] as Boss Wing\n* [[Jacob Cheung]] as cafe cashier\n* [[Joe Cheung|Cheung Tung-jo]] as orchestra member\n* [[David Chiang|John Keung]] as hotel security officer\n* [[Chor Yuen]] as Uncle Tang (Tammy's father)\n* [[Lau Kar-leung]] as doctor\n* [[Kirk Wong]] as Crazy Kung\n* [[Johnny Wang|Wong Lung-wai]] as Wai\n* Lai Ying-chow as Tsao\n* Jamie Luk as Rocky\n* [[John Woo]] as priest\n* [[Tsui Siu-ming]] as priest\n* [[Eric Tsang]] as man talking on the phone <small>(Man on Phone in the American release)</small>\n* David Wu as waiter\n* Pa Shan as thug\n* [[Ringo Lam]] as car mechanic\n* [[Ng See-Yuen|Ng Sze-yuen]] as car mechanic\n* [[Tsui Hark]] as car mechanic\n* [[Clifton Ko]] as sports shop owner\n* [[Tai Kit Mak]]\n\n==Production==\nAccording to co-director [[Tsui Hark]], [[Ringo Lam]] handled most of the action scenes in the film.<ref name=\"Morton186\" /> The action in the film has a larger focus on actual martial arts than on [[Jackie Chan]]'s usual comedic style.<ref name=\"Morton186\" />\n\n===Music===\nMa Yau's Concert depicted in the movie is the [[Ruslan and Lyudmila (opera)|Ruslan and Lyudmila Overture]], by Mikhail Glinka.\n\n==Release==\nThe film received an American release on 9 April 1999 in a dubbed version.<ref name=\"Morton186\" /> The American release of the film cuts 16 minutes of scenes involving [[Wong Jing]] and [[Lau Kar-leung]] in a hospital and a fantasy scene involving [[Maggie Cheung]] singing.<ref name=\"Morton186\" />\n\n==Reception==\n===Box office===\nOn the film's release in [[Hong Kong]], ''Twin Dragons'' was the ninth highest-grossing film of the year, earning {{HK$}}33,225,134 during its theatrical run.<ref name=\"Morton186\">Morton, 2009. p.186</ref> In [[Taiwan]], it was the twelfth top-grossing film of 1992, earning {{NTD|27,972,400}}.<ref name=\"Taiwan\">{{cite web |title=1986 Taiwan Box Office |url=http://cinema.nccu.edu.tw/box/3a/3a86.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010421214724/http://cinema.nccu.edu.tw/box/3a/3a86.htm|website=[[National Chengchi University]] |url-status=dead |archive-date=21 April 2001 |access-date=30 November 2018}}</ref> In Japan, the film grossed {{JPY|545 million|link=yes}}.<ref>{{cite web |title=\u3010\u30b8\u30e3\u30c3\u30ad\u30fc\u30c1\u30a7\u30f3\u8208\u884c\u6210\u7e3e\u3011 \u7b2c12\u56de\uff1a\u65e5\u672c\u3067\u306e\u8208\u884c\u53ce\u5165 |url=http://kungfutube.info/3672 |website=KungFu Tube |year=2012 |access-date=30 November 2018 |language=ja}}</ref> In South Korea, it was the third top-grossing film of 1992, selling 768,951 tickets and grossing {{US$|3.46 million|link=yes}}.<ref name=\"korea2\">{{cite web |title=\u3010\u30b8\u30e3\u30c3\u30ad\u30fc\u30c1\u30a7\u30f3\u8208\u884c\u6210\u7e3e\u3011 \u7b2c10\u56de\uff1a\u97d3\u56fd\u3067\u306e\u8208\u884c\u53ce\u5165 |url=http://kungfutube.info/3156 |website=KungFu Tube |date=5 September 2010 |access-date=7 December 2018 |language=ja}}</ref>\n\nUpon release in [[North America]], the film grossed US$8,332,431 in the United States,<ref name=\"Morton186\"/> ending its North American run with a total of US$8,359,717 in the United States and Canada.<ref>{{cite web |title=Twin Dragons |url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/title/tt0105399/ |website=[[Box Office Mojo]] |access-date=6 June 2020}}</ref> In total, the film grossed {{US$|46,861,333}} worldwide,<ref name=\"JP\">{{cite web |title=Shuang long hui (Twin Dragons) (1999) |url=http://www.jpbox-office.com/fichfilm.php?id=2994 |website=JP's Box-Office |language=fr |access-date=6 June 2020}}</ref> equivalent to US$86,265,362 adjusted for inflation.<ref>{{cite web |title=Shuang long hui (Twin Dragons) -
