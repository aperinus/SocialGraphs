The film was produced by [[McG|Joseph McGinty Nichol]], and released on March 24, 2006 in the United States.\nIt was the first film in five years released by [[Hollywood Pictures]], and also [[Walt Disney Studios (division)|Disney]]'s only horror film to date (not counting any from [[Dimension Films]] before 2005, nor those inherited from the [[20th Century Fox]] catalog).\n\n== Plot ==\nAfter playing a video game titled ''Stay Alive'', Loomis Crowley, his roommate Rex, and Rex's girlfriend Sarah are killed the same way as their characters were killed in the game.\n\nAt Loomis' funeral, his friend Hutch meets Abigail \u2013 a friend of Sarah \u2013 and receives some of Loomis' possessions, including ''Stay Alive''. Hutch, his girlfriend October, and her brother Phineus decide to play the game as a group. They are joined by Abigail and another friend, Swink, while Hutch's boss Miller plays online from his office.\n\nThe game is set in a derelict mansion on Gerouge Plantation, but it only starts when the six players recite \"The Prayer of Elizabeth,\" a request for \"all who resist\" to perish so that their blood can keep the Countess [[Elizabeth B\u00e1thory|Elizabeth Bathory]] young. The players fight through a cemetery of evil ghost children, heading toward a [[mausoleum]] and tower. Miller is directed by the game to pick up a rose. October, a reader of [[occult]] literature, explains that undead spirits cannot move across wild roses. Separated from the others, Miller throws the rose to dispel the spirits of undead girls. Since he is now out of roses, a woman in a red dress, the Countess, kills Miller's character. Minutes later, the Countess appears in Miller's office and kills him by stabbing him with conjoined scissor blades like the ones in the game.\n\nTwo detectives, Thibodeaux and King, question Hutch about the homicides. Hutch realizes that Loomis and Miller played ''Stay Alive'' right before they died, and that they died the same way as their game characters did. October researches Bathory and learns she would drain young women of blood, bathing in it to maintain her youth. Her weakness was mirrors because she could not stand to see herself growing old. Phineus decides to play alone, and despite quitting the game before his character can die, he is killed in real life when he is run over by a horse-drawn carriage. The survivors agree to stop playing ''Stay Alive''. However, Detective King ignores Swink's warning and plays until his character dies. King is then killed in his car.\n\nHutch and Abigail search Loomis' house and learn of the game developer's location: the real Gerouge Plantation. October has discovered that the real Countess Bathory was locked in the tower of her estate as punishment for her gruesome acts and vowed to return one day for revenge, which she is now able to do, as The Prayer of Elizabeth has resurrected her. The Countess can only be killed by driving three nails into her body to trap her soul. October sees the Countess in real life and tries to kill her but realizes that she is a ghost. She has her throat slit by the Countess. The three survivors realize that once the game has begun, it can play by itself. Swink stays in a van and plays the game on his laptop to distract Bathory, while Hutch and Abigail search Gerouge Plantation.\n\nThe Countess begins cheating, arriving in her carriage to kill Swink in real life, even though his character is alive. Swink decides to run for it until he falls over into a bush of roses. Hutch and Abigail return to the van to find Swink's character dead. They take the laptop and some wild roses, which they drop to deter undead children as they move toward the tower. They become separated and Hutch performs the ritual on Bathory's body alone. Bathory's phantom attacks Abigail. At the top of the tower, Hutch finds the preserved body of Elizabeth Bathory and hammers three nails into it, after which the spirit disappears. Bathory's body reanimates; recalling that the Countess hates mirrors, Hutch uses the reflective laptop to repel her before setting the room ablaze. Swink, still alive due to the rose bush, bursts in with Abigail and rescues Hutch. As Bathory's body burns, the three leave the tower.\n\nMeanwhile, the gaming store is now selling copies of ''Stay Alive.'' Intrigued, a worker puts a copy in a [[PlayStation 2]]. As the intro to the game begins, the group reciting Elizabeth Bathory's prayer is heard as the game zooms to Bathory, staring out her window.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Jon Foster]] as Hutch\n* [[Samaire Armstrong]] as Abigail\n* [[Frankie Muniz]] as Swink\n* [[Sophia Bush]] as October\n* [[Jimmi Simpson]] as Phineus\n* [[Wendell Pierce]] as Detective Thibodeaux \n* [[Rio Hackford]] as Detective King\n* [[Milo Ventimiglia]] as Loomis Crowley\n* [[Adam Goldberg]] as Miller Banks\n* Maria Kalinina as Countess\n* [[Billy Slaughter]] as Rex\n* Nicole Oppermann as Sarah\n* [[James Haven]] as Jonathan Malkus, the creator of the game (only in the Unrated Director's Cut)\n* [[Alice Krige]] as the Author (only in the Unrated Director's Cut)\n}}\n\n== Box office ==\n''Stay Alive'' was released in U.S. theaters on March 24, 2006.
