Directed by [[Alan J. Pakula]], and written by Pakula and [[Frank Pierson]], it stars [[Harrison Ford]], [[Brian Dennehy]], [[Ra\u00fal Juli\u00e1]], [[Bonnie Bedelia]], [[Paul Winfield]] and [[Greta Scacchi]]. The film follows Rusty Sabich (Ford), a prosecutor who is charged with the murder of his colleague and [[Mistress (lover)|mistress]] Carolyn Polhemus (Scacchi).\n\nSeveral studios and producers fought to secure the film rights one year before the novel was published. Producers [[Sydney Pollack]] and [[Mark Rosenberg (producer)|Mark Rosenberg]] acquired the rights in December 1986, and hired Pierson to write the script. After an unsuccessful pre-production development at [[United Artists]], the project moved to [[Warner Bros.]], and Pakula was brought in to rewrite the script with Pierson before signing on as the film's director in January 1989. [[Principal photography]] commenced in July 1989 and concluded in October of that year, with a budget of $20 million. Filming took place on locations in [[Detroit]], [[Windsor, Ontario]], and [[New Jersey]], and on soundstages at [[Kaufman Astoria Studios]] in [[New York City|New York]].\n\n''Presumed Innocent'' premiered at the [[Fox Bruin Theater]] in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]] on July 25, 1990, before being released in North America on July 27, 1990. The film has an approval rating of 86% at [[Rotten Tomatoes]], with critics praising its directing, acting, and writing. It grossed $221 million worldwide, and became the [[1990 in film|eighth-highest-grossing film of 1990]]. The film was followed by a television miniseries, ''[[The Burden of Proof (miniseries)|The Burden of Proof]]'', in 1992, and a television film sequel, ''[[Innocent (2011 film)|Innocent]]'', in 2011.\n\n==Plot==\nRozat \"Rusty\" Sabich is a prosecutor and the right-hand man of district attorney Raymond Horgan. When his colleague Carolyn Polhemus is found raped and murdered in her apartment, Raymond insists that Rusty take charge of the investigation. With the election for District Attorney approaching, Tommy Molto, the acting head of the homicide division, has left to join the rival campaign of Nico Della Guardia. Rusty, a married man, faces a conflict of interest since he had a brief sexual affair with Carolyn. As he had shown little ambition and would have therefore been of little use in advancing her career, Carolyn abruptly dumped him. Rusty has since reconciled with his wife Barbara, but is still obsessed with Carolyn.\n\nDetective Harold Greer is initially in charge of the murder investigation, but Rusty has him replaced with his friend Detective Dan Lipranzer, whom he persuades to narrow the inquiry so that his relationship with Carolyn is left out. Raymond grows furious with Rusty's handling of the case, but admits that he had also been romantically involved with Carolyn at one time. Rusty soon discovers that Molto is making his own inquiries. Aspects of the crime suggest that the killer knew police evidence-gathering procedures and covered up clues accordingly. Semen found in the victim's body contains only dead sperm. The killer's blood is type A, the same as Rusty's. When Della Guardia wins the election, he and Molto accuse Rusty of the murder and push to get evidence against him. Rusty's fingerprints are found on a beer glass from Carolyn's apartment, and fibers from his carpet at home match those found on her body. Lipranzer is removed from the case, and Greer's inquiries uncover the affair.\n\nRusty calls on Sandy Stern, a top defense attorney. At trial, it is revealed that the beer glass is missing, and Stern persuades Judge Larren Lyttle to keep this from the jury. Raymond testifies and perjures himself, claiming that Rusty insisted on handling the investigation, thus confirming the defense's claim of a frame-up. Rusty discovers that Carolyn had acquired a file for a bribery case involving a man named Leon Wells. Upon being confronted by Rusty and Lipranzer, Wells confesses that he paid Judge Lyttle $1,500 to have criminal charges against him dropped, with Carolyn acting as a facilitator.\n\nThe thrust of Stern's defense is that Della Guardia and Molto have framed Rusty in order to cover up the bribery case. During the cross-examination of the coroner, it is revealed that Carolyn underwent a [[tubal ligation]], thus having no reason to use the spermicidal contraceptive which was found on her. Stern asserts that the only explanation for this discrepancy is that the fluid sample was not actually taken from Carolyn's body. Based on the disappearance of the beer glass, the lack of motive and the fact that the fluid sample was rendered meaningless, Judge Lyttle dismisses the charges. Rusty confronts Stern for bringing up the bribery file in the case. Stern swears him to secrecy, revealing that Lyttle had a brief sexual encounter with Carolyn. Stern also confesses that he and Raymond knew that Lyttle was taking bribes, and although Lyttle had offered his resignation, Raymond felt that he was a brilliant judge and deserved another chance. Lipranzer meets with Rusty and reveals the missing beer glass, explaining that he never returned it to evidence when the investigation was turned over to Della Guardia and Molto. Rusty throws it into a river.\n\nAt his home, Rusty discovers a small hatchet covered with Carolyn's blood and hair on it. As he washes the tool, Barbara admits that she murdered Carolyn, her motive being Rusty's adulterous affair. She expresses that she had left enough evidence for Rusty to know that she committed the crime, but did not anticipate him being charged with the murder. In a voice-over, Rusty explains that Carolyn's murder has been written off as unsolved, since trying two people for the same crime is \"a practical impossibility\" and he cannot leave his son without a mother even if she could be tried. Rusty regrets that it was his own lust that caused his wife to commit murder.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Harrison Ford]] as Rozat K. \"Rusty\" Sabich\n* [[Brian Dennehy]] as Raymond Horgan\n* [[Raul Julia]] as Alejandro \"Sandy\" Stern\n* [[Bonnie Bedelia]] as Barbara Sabich\n* [[Paul Winfield]] as Judge Larren L.
