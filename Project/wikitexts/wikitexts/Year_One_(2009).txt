His hut destroyed after Zed burns the village down by accident, the gatherer Oh reluctantly joins Zed on a journey to discover what the world has to offer.\n\nThey encounter [[Cain and Abel]]. Cain kills Abel with a boulder in an act of rage and tells Zed and Oh that they must escape with him or else he will be accused of killing Abel.\n\nZed and Oh find out their love interests, Maya and Eema, from their former tribe have been captured and sold into [[slavery]]. Trying to buy the girls' freedom, they end up being sold as slaves themselves, as Cain had been wanting to rid himself of the murder's witnesses. Whilst in transport, the slave caravan containing Oh, Zed, Maya, Eema and others from their tribe is attacked and overpowered by [[Sodom and Gomorrah|Sodomites]]. Zed and Oh escape and hide in the desert but lose track of the now Sodomite-led slave caravan.\n\nStill resolved to free the slaves and knowing the caravan's new destination, Zed and Oh pass by a mountain where they find [[Abraham]] [[Binding of Isaac|about to kill his son]] [[Isaac]]. Zed stops them, telling Abraham [[God|Abraham's Deity]] sent him to do so. He takes them to his Hebrew village and tells them about the cities of [[Sodom and Gomorrah]].\n \nZed and Oh head off for Sodom when Abraham plans to [[circumcise]] them. As they arrive they are captured. Cain, now a Sodomite soldier, saves them from being sodomized, calling them his \"brothers\". They remind Cain he sold them as slaves; he apologizes and offers them food, gives Zed and Oh a tour of the city and gets them jobs as guards. \nWhile patrolling the city they see the princess Inanna, who is fasting as she feels guilty that most of the city is starving. She notices Zed and has him invited to a party that night, surreptitiously pulling him aside for clandestine discussion.\n\nInside the palace, Zed sees Maya and Eema serving as slaves, but Oh is forced to follow the High Priest around the palace while Zed meets with Princess Inanna, who asks him to enter the [[Holy of Holies]] and tell her what it is like, believing Zed is the \"Chosen One\".\n\nInside the temple, Zed encounters Oh, who is hiding from the high priest. They get into a heated argument and are ratted on by an eavesdropping Cain, who then imprisons them for entering the temple. Sentenced to be [[stoned to death]], Zed convinces the Sodomites to have mercy, so they are instead sentenced to hard labor until they die from work.\n\nThe king then announces that he will sacrifice his daughter and two virgins (Maya and Eema), who were labeled by Cain as \"followers of [[The Chosen One (trope)|the Chosen One]]\", as a gift to the gods. The growing crowd, already at its breaking point from the famine, reacts negatively as Princess Inanna is already very popular for her regular displays of solidarity with the people.\n\nZed interrupts the ceremony and Oh instigates a riot with the exclamation \"The Chosen One Comes\"! Abraham arrives with the Hebrews to help overthrow the King. Oh and Eema have sex inside the palace, meaning that Eema cannot be sacrificed. They help Zed subdue the other soldiers, who have already turned on and killed the King.\n\nTogether Zed and Oh stop the High Priest from sacrificing Maya. The crowd is ready to proclaim Zed as the Leader being the \"Chosen One\" but he decides that his love for Oh, Eema, and Maya outstrips his wish to be a Savior persona. He lets Inanna rule, and becomes an explorer with Maya. Oh becomes the leader of his home village. The two say goodbye and head their separate ways.\n\n=== Style ===\nThe film uses the [[translation convention]] to comedic effect, presenting man [[Prehistoric people|prehistoric]] and Roman-era people speaking modern [[American English regional vocabulary|American English]], and some Romans and royalty speaking [[British English]].{{citation needed|date=November 2021}}\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Jack Black]] as Zed, son of Zero\n* [[Michael Cera]] as Oh, son of Ooh\n* [[Oliver Platt]] as [[High Priest]]\n* [[David Cross]] as [[Cain]]\n* [[Christopher Mintz-Plasse]] as [[Isaac]]\n* [[Vinnie Jones]] as [[Sargon of Akkad|Sargon]]\n* [[Hank Azaria]] as [[Abraham]]\n* [[Juno Temple]] as Eema, daughter of Zero and sister of Zed\n* [[Olivia Wilde]] as Princess [[Inanna]]<ref>{{cite news| url= https://www.variety.com/article/VR1117978866 | work=Variety | title=Olivia Wilde joins Ramis' 'Year One' | first=Tatiana | last=Siegel | date=2008-01-10}}</ref>\n* [[June Diane Raphael]] as Maya\n* [[Gia Carides]] as The Queen\n* [[Horatio Sanz]] as [[Enmebaragesi]]\n* [[David Pasquesi]] as Prime Minister\n* [[Matthew Willig|Matthew J.
