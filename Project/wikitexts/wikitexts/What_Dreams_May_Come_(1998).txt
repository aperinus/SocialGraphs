Starring [[Robin Williams]], [[Annabella Sciorra]], and [[Cuba Gooding Jr.]], it won the [[Academy Award for Best Visual Effects]] and the [[Art Directors Guild]] Award for Excellence in Production Design. It was also nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Production Design|Academy Award for Best Art Direction]]. The title is from a line in [[Hamlet]]{{'}}s \"[[To be, or not to be]]\" [[soliloquy]].<ref name=\"nss\">[http://www.nosweatshakespeare.com/quotes/soliloquies/hamlet-to-be-or-not-to-be.htm No Sweat Shakespeare], ''To Be Or Not To Be'': Hamlet Soliloquy. Line 11.</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nWhile vacationing in [[Switzerland]], pediatrician Chris Nielsen meets artist Annie Collins. They marry and have two children, Ian and Marie. Their idyllic life ends when the children die in a car crash. Four years later, Chris is also killed in a car crash. Unaware that he is dead, and confused that no one will interact with him, Chris lingers on Earth.\n\nHe sees Annie's attempts to cope with his loss and attempts to communicate with her, despite advice from a presence that this will only cause her more pain. When his attempts indeed cause more sorrow, he decides to move on. Chris awakens in a [[Heaven]] that he has created with his imagination; his surroundings are a mountainous landscape that resembles a painting created by his wife, and is similar to a place where the two desired to spend their old age.\n\nChris is accompanied in Heaven by Albert Lewis, his friend and mentor from his medical residency, and Leona, a stewardess whom Chris once admired in the presence of his daughter; he later comes to recognize Leona as his daughter Marie. Meanwhile, Annie is wracked with guilt for the deaths of Chris and their children, and commits [[suicide]]. Chris, who is initially relieved that her suffering is over, grows angry when he learns that those who die by suicide go to [[Hell]]; this is not the result of a judgment made against them, but rather their own tendency to create nightmare afterlife worlds based on their pain.\n\nChris is adamant that he will rescue Annie from Hell, despite Albert's insistence that no one has ever succeeded in doing so with someone who died by suicide. Aided by a \"tracker\", Chris and Albert descend into Hell. On the journey there, Chris realizes that Albert is actually Ian and parts ways with him before his search for Annie.\n\nChris and the tracker arrive at a dark and twisted version of Chris and Annie's house. The tracker then reveals himself as the real Albert and warns Chris that if he stays with Annie for more than a few minutes he may be permanently trapped in Hell, advising that all Chris can reasonably expect is an opportunity for a final farewell to Annie. Chris enters their now-horrific looking home to find Annie suffering from [[amnesia]], unable to remember her suicide, and visibly tortured by her decrepit surroundings. Unable to stir her memories, the tracker sees Chris give up his quest to save Annie from Hell.\n\nBut instead of returning to Heaven, Chris chooses to join Annie forever in Hell. As he declares to Annie his intent to stay, his words parallel something he had said to her as he left her in an institution following the children's deaths, and she regains her memories while Chris is making her nightmare his. Annie, wanting to save Chris, ascends to Heaven, taking Chris with her. Chris and Annie are reunited with their children in Heaven, and all appearances are restored. Chris proposes [[reincarnation]], so he and Annie can experience life together again. The film ends with Chris and Annie meeting again as young children in a situation that parallels their first meeting.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Robin Williams]] as Dr. Christopher James \"Chris\" Nielsen\n* [[Cuba Gooding Jr.]] as Albert Lewis / Ian Nielsen\n* [[Annabella Sciorra]] as Annie Collins-Nielsen\n* [[Max von Sydow]] as The Tracker / Albert Lewis\n* Jessica Brooks Grant as Marie Nielsen\n* Josh Paddock as Ian Nielsen\n* [[Rosalind Chao]] as Leona / Marie Nielsen\n* [[Lucinda Jenney]] as Mrs. Jacobs\n* Maggie McCarthy as Stacey Jacobs\n\nAdditionally, director [[Werner Herzog]] has a cameo as one of the Faces of the Damned.\n\n==Production==\nPrincipal photography for ''What Dreams May Come'' began in late June 1997. It was shot largely on Fuji [[Velvia]] film and is one of few films to have been shot in this manner. The Fuji [[Velvia]] film is known among landscape photographers for its vivid color reproduction.<ref name=\"cinemablend\">[http://www.cinemablend.com/reviews/What-Dreams-May-Come-461.html ''What Dreams May Come'' Movie Review] ''Cinema Blend''</ref> The visual effects developments were created by Mass.lllusions in the same group that developed the [[bullet time]] visual effects in ''[[The Matrix]]''.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://vfxvoice.com/painting-the-afterlife-in-what-dreams-may-come/| title = Painting the Afterlife in WHAT DREAMS MAY COME |work=VFX Voice| date = September 27, 2018 |access-date = October 22, 2018| first=Ian | last=Failes}}</ref>\n\nFilming locations include places in [[Marin County, California|Marin County]], [[Alameda County, California|Alameda County]], [[Glacier National Park (U.S.)|Glacier National Park]],<ref name=\"fia\">[http://www.filminamerica.com/Movies/WhatDreamsMayCome/ ''What Dreams May Come'' locations].

Chris and Annie will meet again in their new lives, but Annie must atone for killing herself&mdash;her new incarnation will die young, and Chris will spend the remainder of this life as a widower before the two are again reunited in Heaven. The film then goes to Sri Lanka where a woman is giving birth to a girl, presumed to be Annie. In Philadelphia, a boy is born, presumably Chris.\n\n===Music===\nThe [[film score|musical score]] for ''What Dreams May Come'' was composed and conducted by [[Michael Kamen]] and produced by [[James Seymour Brett]]. [[Ennio Morricone]] had completed and recorded a full score for the film but, after editorial changes were made, his score was rejected and Kamen was hired in his place. Short on time, Kamen took the song \"[[Beside You (New York Rock and Roll Ensemble song)|Beside You]]\" from his band the [[New York Rock & Roll Ensemble]]'s 1971 album ''Roll Over'' and adapted it as the film's main musical theme.<ref>[http://users.telenet.be/soundtrack-fm/Reviews/Ennio_Morricone/what_dreams/what_dreams.htm WHAT DREAMS MAY COME - \"They rejected it because it was too emotional?\"], Radio Soundtrack f-m</ref> With just over three weeks to write, record, and mix the score, Kamen took a more direct approach. \"I was at an extremely profound juncture in my own life at that time, and the film produced a powerful and personal response in me,\" said Kamen. \"I know, despite the mixed response to the film itself, that I accomplished one of my best and most focused scores.\"<ref>{{cite web |last1=Goldwasser |first1=Dan |title=Dreams of Giants With Michael Kamen |url=https://www.soundtrack.net/content/article/?id=42 |website=[[Soundtrack.Net]] |access-date=September 5, 2018 |date=September 4, 1999}}</ref>\n\nThe score was performed by the London Metropolitan Orchestra and recorded at both [[Associated Independent Recording|Air Studios]] and [[Abbey Road Studios]]. A soundtrack album was released on October 13, 1998 by [[Beyond Records]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Clemmensen |first1=Christian |title=Filmtracks: What Dreams May Come (Michael Kamen) |url=http://www.filmtracks.com/titles/what_dreams.html |website=[[Filmtracks.com]] |access-date=September 5, 2018 |date=October 15, 1998}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=What Dreams May Come - Michael Kamen |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/what-dreams-may-come-mw0000047340 |website=[[AllMusic]] |publisher=[[All Media Network]] |access-date=September 5, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Differences from the novel==\nThe film differs significantly from the novel, in its plot and its vision of the afterlife.\n\nIn the novel, there are far more references to [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophical]], [[New Age]] and [[paranormal]] beliefs.<ref>Julien R. Fielding, ''Discovering World Religions At 24 Frames Per Second'', published in ''Journal of Media and Religion'' Volume 8, Issue 4, Oct. 2009.</ref> The author Richard Matheson claims in an introductory note that only the characters are fictional, and that most everything else is based on research (the book includes an extensive [[bibliography]]). Story elements that do not show up in the film include [[astral projection]], [[telepathy]], a [[s\u00e9ance]], and the term \"[[The Summerland|Summerland]]\" (a name for a simplified Heaven in Theosophy, and for Heaven in general in religions such as [[Wicca]]).\n\nThe details of Chris's life on Earth differ strongly in the novel. Only Chris and his wife (called Ann) die. Their children, who are grownups rather than youngsters, remain alive, as minor characters. Albert and Leona are the people they appear to be, and the character played by Max Von Sydow does not appear in the book. Albert is Chris's cousin rather than simply a friend. Chris and Ann are rural types rather than the urbanites portrayed in the film, and he is not a pediatrician, nor is she a painter. He is a Hollywood screenwriter, and she has a variety of jobs.\n\nIn the book the afterlife imagery is based on natural scenery rather than paintings. The novel's depiction of Hell is considerably more violent than in the film. Chris finds it difficult to move, breathe, or see, and he suffers physical torture at the hands of some inhabitants. He does not encounter ships, thunderstorms, fire, or the sea of human faces that his film counterpart walks upon. Instead, he and Albert climb craggy cliffs and encounter such sights as a swarm of insects that attack people.\n\nAnn is consigned to Hell for twenty four years, not eternity. At the end, which resembles an alternate version{{clarify|date=August 2016}} of the film but not the standard version, she escapes from Hell by being reincarnated, because she is not ready for Heaven.\n\n==Reception==\nThe film was the second highest-grossing film at the U.S. box office in its opening week and went on to gross $55 million in the United States and Canada, while grossing a further $20 million internationally for a worldwide total of $75 million.<ref name=ww />\n\nUpon its initial release, critical reception for ''What Dreams May Come'' was mixed. On [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film has an approval rating of 53%, based on 68 reviews, with an average score of 5.70/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \"An insubstantial plot overshadows the beautiful, surreal scenery.\"<ref>{{cite web |title=What Dreams May Come (1998) |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/what_dreams_may_come/ |website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |publisher=[[Fandango Media|Fandango]] |access-date=2021-01-01 }}</ref> On [[Metacritic]], the film has a weighted average average score of 44 out of 100, based on reviews from 25 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews.\"<ref>{{cite web |title=What Dreams May Come Reviews |url=https://www.metacritic.com/movie/what-dreams-may-come |website=[[Metacritic]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |access-date=2021-01-01 }}</ref> Audiences surveyed by [[CinemaScore]] gave the film a grade \"B\" on a scale of A+ to F.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.cinemascore.com/publicsearch/index/title/ |title= Cinemascore |url-status= live |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20181220122629/https://www.cinemascore.com/publicsearch/index/title/ |archive-date= 2018-12-20 }}</ref>\n\n[[Roger Ebert]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' awarded the film three and a half stars out of four, remarking: \n{{cquote| This is a film that even in its imperfect form shows how movies can imagine the unknown, can lead our imaginations into wonderful places.
