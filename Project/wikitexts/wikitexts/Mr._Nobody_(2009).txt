It tells the life story of Nemo Nobody, an 118-year-old man who is the last mortal on Earth after the [[Anti-aging movement|human race has achieved quasi-immortality]]. Nemo, memory fading, tells a doctor and journalist about his three main loves and his parents' divorce and the subsequent hardships he endured. The speculative narrative frequently changes course to investigate the alternate life paths that could have resulted from his making different decisions in his life, focusing on when he is nine, fifteen, and thirty-four. The film has [[nonlinear narrative]] that incorporates the [[multiverse|multiverse hypothesis]].\n\nThe world premiere of ''Mr. Nobody'' was at the [[66th Venice International Film Festival]], where it received the [[Golden Osella]] and the Biografilm Lancia Award. Critical response to the film was generally positive, and it was nominated for seven [[Magritte Awards]], winning six, including [[Magritte Award for Best Film|Best Film]] and [[Magritte Award for Best Director|Best Director]] for Van Dormael. The film was mostly funded through European financiers, and was released in Belgium on 13 January 2010. Since its original release, ''Mr. Nobody'' has become a [[cult film]], noted for its philosophy, cinematography, personal characters, and [[Pierre Van Dormael]]'s soundtrack.<ref>{{cite web|first=Damon |last=Wise |url=https://www.empireonline.com/features/damonwise/Post.asp?id=684 |title=Venice 09: Mr Nobody |work=[[Empire (film magazine)|Empire]] |publisher=[[Bauer Media Group]] |date=12 September 2009 |access-date=28 June 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120325071515/http://www.empireonline.com/features/damonwise/post.asp?id=684 |archive-date=25 March 2012 }}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n{{Long plot|reason=Over a thousand words.|date=October 2020}}\nIn 2092, humanity has conquered mortality through the endless renewal of [[Cell (biology)|cells]]. The world watches in fascination as the 118-year-old Nemo Nobody, the last mortal on Earth, edges towards death. No record can be found of his past and his memories are confused, so Dr. Feldheim, a psychiatrist, uses [[hypnosis]] to help Nemo remember his life. Curious to know about the world before quasi-immortality, a journalist also interviews Nemo, whose recollections primarily come from three points in his life: age 9, age 15, and age 34. Nemo makes contradictory statements, describing events from his past as having unfolded in multiple different ways, and explains that, before birth, children remember everything that will happen in their lives. At the moment of conception, the [[Lailah#Midrash|Angels of Oblivion erase the children's memories]], but he says the Angels forgot about him, allowing him to \"remember\" different possible futures for himself.\n\nAt age 9, after his parents' divorce, Nemo says he was forced to choose whether to leave with his mother or stay with his father, and he describes what happened both when he managed to catch and board his mother's train at the last second, and when he failed to do so and was left behind.\n\n===Life with his mother===\nNemo moves with his mother to [[Montreal]]. When he is a rebellious teenager, a new girl, Anna, comes to his school, and he is immediately smitten. One day at the beach, Anna asks if Nemo would like to swim with her and her friends. He insults her friends and they hardly see each other again.\n\nIn an alternate timeline, Nemo admits to Anna that he cannot swim, and the two spend time together. Nemo learns that Anna is the daughter of his mother's new boyfriend, and then husband, Harry, and the step-siblings begin an affair, pledging their lives to one another. When Harry and Nemo's mother get divorced, Anna goes to [[New York City|New York]] with her father, and the teenagers lose touch. Years later, Nemo, who still hopes to someday see Anna again, works as a [[Swimming pool service technician|pool cleaner]]. One day, he and Anna pass at a train station and the pair immediately recognize each other. After a passionate reunion, Anna announces she is not ready to immediately resume the relationship. She gives Nemo her number and asks him to call her in two days and meet at a lighthouse in a local park, but he loses her phone number when a sudden downpour makes her note illegible. Nemo waits at the lighthouse every day, but Anna does not come.\n\nIn one possible life, Anna and Nemo are married with children. Nemo works at a [[television studio]] narrating educational videos. One evening, while returning home, he hits a bird, loses control of his car, plummets into a lake, and drowns.\n\n===Life with his father===\nNemo stays in England with his father, who later becomes [[disabled]]. As a teenager, he works in a shop and spends his free time writing a [[Science fiction literature|science fiction story]] about a journey to Mars. At a school dance, he meets Elise and falls in love. A few days later, he goes to her house and sees her with her 22-year-old boyfriend. Frustrated, Nemo speeds away on his motorcycle, has an accident, and is hospitalized in a [[Persistent vegetative state|vegetative state]]. Though he cannot move or speak, he can perceive the world through his senses and detects his parents' reunion at his bedside. He imagines his fingers are on the keyboard of his typewriter and continues to work on his story.\n\nIn an alternate timeline, Nemo speaks with Elise at her house. She tells him that she is in love with her boyfriend, Stefano, even though she knows he does not love her, but Nemo does not back down. He keeps assuring her of his feelings, and Elise eventually gives in. A few years later, she and Nemo get married. In one version of this timeline, Elise dies on their wedding day in an explosion. Nemo, in a reality mirroring his sci-fi story, takes her [[Cremation|ashes]] to Mars and spreads them on the planet's surface, which he had promised to do when they were teenagers. Aboard the spacecraft on the way back to Earth, he meets Anna, but, before they can say much to each other, the ship is destroyed by asteroids. In another version of this string of events, as an adult, Nemo works at the same television studio as he does in the timeline where he married Anna, and one of his coworkers drowns in the lake. The coworker's widow is Anna, whom Nemo feels he has seen before. Another timeline has Nemo and Elise married with three children, but their marriage is unhappy, as Elise suffers from [[borderline personality disorder]] and chronic depression. She has attacks of [[hysteria]] and, despite Nemo's attempts to save their marriage, ultimately leaves him to pursue Stefano.\n\nAlternately, after being rejected by Elise, teenage Nemo resolves to marry the first girl who will dance with him at the next school dance, who turns out to be Jean. Though he and Jean marry and have two sons and he becomes rich, Nemo grows unhappy and bored with his life, so he puts all of his assets in Jean's name and leaves his family. Now making all of his decisions randomly via coin toss, he goes to the airport and tells a [[chauffeur]] that he is Daniel Jones, the man the chauffeur is waiting for. He is taken to a hotel, where he is murdered while taking a bath, and his body is dumped in the woods by the assassins, who question whether they have killed the right man.\n\nAs well as the many paths that Nemo's life could take or has taken, adult Nemo is also seen to repeatedly awaken in an artificial, surrealistic environment dominated by [[Argyle (pattern)|argyle patterns]]. Following clues that he finds scattered throughout this world, he arrives at a dilapidated house, where he finds a DVD player hooked up to a television. In a strangely interactive video, 34-year-old Nemo is told by 118-year-old Nemo that this is a universe where Nemo Nobody was never born and his consciousness is stuck in some sort of limbo. The old Nemo states that he is experiencing the story from the end and the adult Nemo must stay alive until 5:50&nbsp;a.m. on 12 February 2092.\n\n===Epilogue===\nBefore his death, old Nemo tells the journalist that neither of them exist\u2014they are figments of the imagination of 9-year-old Nemo at the train station as he struggles to choose between his parents. This is an impossible decision, but he knows it will define his life from then on, so the young boy is trying to determine which is the correct choice by tracing various potential outcomes of each. Ultimately, he takes a third option: he leaves both parents and runs away towards an unknown future.\n\nOn his death bed, Nemo recalls a reunion with Anna at the lighthouse. The calculated time of his death arrives, and his last word, \"Anna\", is broadcast to the world. The universe ceases to [[Expansion of the universe|expand]] and begins to [[Big Crunch|contract]]. The flow of time having reversed, old Nemo comes back to life and begins to cackle joyously. The other dead Nemos also come back to life, and Nemo's parents get back together. 9-year-old Nemo reverse-runs to 9-year-old Anna and reverse-skips rocks with her.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Flickr - nicogenin - 66\u00e8me Festival de Venise (Mostra) - Jared Leto (13).jpg|thumb|The cast at the premiere for the film in September 2009 (left to right): [[Linh Dan Pham]], [[Sarah Polley]], [[Diane Kruger]], and [[Jared Leto]]]]\n* [[Jared Leto]] as Nemo Nobody (both 34- and 118-years-old).

But as soon as they start a family she realizes that something is missing in their relationship, that he's never really there. It also shows that lives that seem perfect on paper might not be so perfect in reality.\"<ref name=\"press11\"/>\n** [[Audrey Giacomini]] as Jean (age 15)\n* [[Rhys Ifans]] as Nemo's Father. Van Dormael chose Ifans for the part after seeing his \"multifaceted\" performances in ''[[Notting Hill (film)|Notting Hill]]'' (1999) and ''[[Enduring Love (film)|Enduring Love]]'' (2004).<ref name=\"press7\"/>\n* [[Natasha Little]] as Nemo's Mother. Little was suggested for the part by the casting director in London. Van Dormael said that \"her role was decisive for the film: it was necessary that the mother should destroy the childhood happiness but that one would feel the need to go with her at the same time. That's what Natasha managed to achieve.\"<ref>{{Harvnb|Jouneaux|Duvoisin|Rey|2009|pp=7\u20138}}</ref>\n* [[Allan Corduner]] as Dr. Feldheim\n* [[Daniel Mays]] as Young Journalist\n* [[Michael Riley]] as Harry, Anna's father\n* Harold Manning as TV Host\n* [[Ben Mansfield]] as Stefano (both 22- and 40-years-old), teenage-Elise's boyfriend\n\nDirector [[Jaco Van Dormael]] makes a [[cameo appearance]] as [[Brazil]]ian Man, and [[Pascal Duquenne]], one of the stars of Dormael's previous film ''[[The Eighth Day (1996 film)|The Eighth Day]]'', also has a cameo.\n\n==Production==\n===Writing===\nThe idea of parallel lives had been explored in earlier films such as ''[[Run Lola Run]]'' (1998) and ''[[Sliding Doors]]'' (1998), which influenced [[Jaco Van Dormael]]'s writing of ''Mr. Nobody''. Unlike those films, however, this one has philosophical underpinnings inspired by scientific tomes on [[chaos theory]] and the [[butterfly effect]], [[pigeon superstition]], and the [[space-time continuum]].<ref name=\"return\"/> Van Dormael stated: \"My starting point was a 12-minute short I made in 1982 called ''[[\u00c8 pericoloso sporgersi (1984 film)|\u00c8 pericoloso sporgersi]]''. A kid runs behind a train with two possible choices: to go with his mother or with his father. From there we follow two possible futures. I started one version based on the fact that a woman jumps or doesn't jump on a train. Then ''Sliding Doors'' by [[Peter Howitt]] came out, followed by ''Run Lola Run'' by [[Tom Tykwer]]. I had to find something else. And that's when I realised that the story I was trying to tell was not binary, that I was above all interested by the multiplicity and complexity of choices. With this screenplay I wanted to make the viewer feel the abyss that is the infinity of possibilities. Beyond this, I wanted to find a different way of telling a story. I wanted the gaze of the child on his future to meet the gaze of the old man he has become on his past. I wanted to talk about complexity through cinema, which is a simplifying medium. While reality around us is more and more complex, the information is more and more succinct, political speeches are more and more simplistic. What interests me is complexity. Not the simple answers, which are reassuring but bound to be false.\"<ref>{{Harvnb|Jouneaux|Duvoisin|Rey|2009|pp=5\u20136}}</ref>\n\nDescribing the scale of the film, the director said: \"My producers don't like me saying it, but it's really a big-budget experimental film about the many different lives one person can live, depending on the choices he makes. It's about the infinite possibilities facing any person. There are no good or bad choices in life. It's simply that each choice will create another life for you. What's interesting is to be alive.\"<ref name=\"town\"/>\n\nWhile producing the film, Van Dormael took the unique step of publishing his screenplay.<ref name=\"cinergie\"/>\n\n===Development===\nThe film is Van Dormael's first feature since ''[[The Eighth Day (1996 film)|The Eighth Day]]'' in 1996.
