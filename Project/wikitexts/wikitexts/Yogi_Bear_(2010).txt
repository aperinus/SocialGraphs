Based on the [[Hanna-Barbera]] [[Animated series|animated television series]] ''[[The Yogi Bear Show]]'',<ref name=\"HollywoodReporter\"/> the film stars [[Anna Faris]], [[Tom Cavanagh]], [[T.J. Miller]], [[Nate Corddry]] and [[Andrew Daly]], alongside the voices of [[Dan Aykroyd]] and [[Justin Timberlake]]. The film centers on [[Yogi Bear]] and his sidekick [[Boo-Boo Bear]] as they try to stop their home, [[Jellystone Park]], from being logged. Production on the film took place in [[New Zealand]] in October 2008.\n\nProduced by [[Donald De Line]]'s De Line Pictures and Karen Rosenfelt's Sunswept Entertainment, ''Yogi Bear'' premiered at [[Westwood, Los Angeles|Westwood]] on December 11, 2010 and was theatrically released in the United States six days later on December 17 by [[Warner Bros. Pictures]]. Upon release, the film was met with largely negative reviews from critics and audiences for its screenplay, humor and lack of originality, though they praised the visual effects, vocal performances and faithfulness to the source material. Despite its negative reception, the film was a box office success, having grossed $203.5 million worldwide against an $80 million budget.\n\n== Plot ==\n<!-- PER WP:FILMPLOT, PLOT SUMMARIES FOR FEATURE FILMS SHOULD BE BETWEEN 400 AND 700 WORDS. -->\nMayor R. Brown realizes that Franklin City is facing bankruptcy due to profligate spending on his part. Brown plots with his Chief of Staff to raise money for the town budget and his upcoming gubernatorial campaign by shutting down [[Jellystone Park]] and opening the land to logging. To save the park, [[park ranger]]s [[Ranger Smith|Smith]] and Jones, with help from documentary filmmaker Rachel Johnson, hold a centennial festival and [[fireworks]] show in an attempt to sell [[Season ticket|season pass]]es. To sabotage the effort, Brown promises Jones the position of head ranger if the funds are not raised. Two [[brown bear]]s named [[Yogi Bear|Yogi]] and [[Boo-Boo Bear|Boo-Boo]], who steal [[picnic basket]]s from visitors in [[Jellystone Park]] while the rangers attempt to hinder them, had promised Smith to stay out of sight during the festival, but Jones convinces them otherwise. The bears try to please the crowd with a water skiing performance, but Yogi inadvertently sets his cape on fire, causing fireworks to be launched into the crowd, who flee in panic. After Jellystone is shut down, Smith is forced to stay in Evergreen Park, and scolds Yogi for interfering with the festival. Seeing that their home is in danger of being destroyed, Yogi and Boo-Boo travel to Evergreen Park where they and Smith figure out Brown's plan. They all return to Jellystone with Rachel, where they learn that Boo-Boo's pet [[turtle]] is a rare and [[endangered species]] known as a \"frog-mouthed\" turtle, meaning that, according to law, the park cannot be destroyed if the turtle is living there.\n\nThe Chief of Staff learns about the turtle and sends Jones to kidnap it. On the day that Brown is planning a press conference to begin the destruction of the park, Smith, Rachel and the bears rescue the turtle and try to bring it to the media's attention. Jones, learning that he had been deceived by Mayor Brown, has a change of heart and helps the team bring the turtle to the press conference. At the press conference, Rachel reveals that she had installed a hidden camera in Boo-Boo's bow tie which had captured Brown admitting to his plan. Smith hooks up the camera to the [[jumbotron]] Brown is using for his press conference and shows the video, causing the crowd to turn against him. After Brown and his staff are arrested for their crimes, Jellystone Park is reopened and becomes a great success with Smith reappointed as head ranger, he and Rachel admit their feelings for each other, and after they kiss, they discover Yogi and Boo-Boo stealing picnic baskets once again.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Dan Aykroyd]] as the voice of [[Yogi Bear]], a [[picnic basket]]-stealing and talking [[brown bear]] who lives in Jellystone Park.\n* [[Justin Timberlake]] as the voice of [[Boo-Boo Bear|Boo-Boo]], Yogi's best friend and sometimes the voice of reason.\n* [[Tom Cavanagh]] as [[Ranger Smith]], the head ranger of Jellystone Park.\n* [[Anna Faris]] as Rachel Johnson, a nature documentary filmmaker, and Ranger Smith's love interest.\n* [[T.J.

That's where the origin of [[American humor]] is.\"<ref name=\"Breznican\"/> Aykroyd also stated that he grew up watching ''Yogi Bear'' on the long, cold and dark afternoons in his native [[Ottawa]]: \"As a kid growing up in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, where the sky turns dark in the winter at about 3:30, Yogi Bear was my fire, my hearth, when I would come home.

Regarding the film, Brevig stated that he didn't want parents who remembered watching ''Yogi Bear'' cartoons in their youth to feel marginalized and displaced by the film's contemporary depiction of Yogi Bear.<ref name=\"Breznican\"/>\n\n[[Rhythm and Hues Studios]] provided the [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] character animation for Yogi and Boo-Boo Bear and the frog-mouthed turtle in the film; the company had also worked on previous films based on Hanna-Barbera productions, such as ''[[The Flintstones (film)|The Flintstones]]'' (1994) and its prequel ''[[The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas|Viva Rock Vegas]]'' (2000); ''[[Scooby-Doo (film)|Scooby-Doo]]'' (2002) and its sequel ''[[Scooby-Doo 2: Monsters Unleashed|Monsters Unleashed]]'' (2004).\n\n== Release ==\nThe film was originally scheduled for release on June 25, 2010, but was pushed back to December 17, 2010 in order to avoid competition with ''[[Grown Ups (film)|Grown Ups]]''.<ref name=\"HollywoodReporter\" /> In theaters, the film was accompanied by a [[Computer animation|CGI]] ''[[Looney Tunes]]'' short titled ''[[Rabid Rider]]'', starring [[Wile E.
