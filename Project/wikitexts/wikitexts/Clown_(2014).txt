However, the clown hired for their party is unable to make it. Fortunately, Kent discovers an old [[clown]] costume in the basement of a house he is selling and puts it on. After the party, he falls asleep wearing the outfit, and the following day finds he cannot take it off.\n\nHe is forced to wear the costume to work, where he again tries to remove it. When he returns home, he complains about the situation to his wife, Meg. She is able to remove the fake nose but unintentionally wounds him in the process. The family dog, Shadow, accidentally eats the fake nose. Meg also realizes the clown's wig has become Kent's natural hair. Kent starts to exhibit strange behavior and experiences a deep sense of hunger, eating all the food in the house.\n\nKent enlists the help of Herbert Karlsson, the suit's previous owner. Karlsson begs him not to touch the costume, but after learning Kent is already wearing it, insists on meeting him at the old costume warehouse. Kent learns that the outfit is the hair and skin of an [[Icelandic folklore|ancient Icelandic demon]] called the \"Cl\u00f6yne\". Karlsson drugs Kent, revealing that [[dismemberment]] is the only way to prevent the [[metamorphosis]] and [[Spirit possession|possession]]. Kent fights back and subdues Karlsson, and while driving him to the police station to report the assault, his fingers and toes begin to grow excessively, causing him to crash the car.\n\nKent decides to try to kill himself and goes to one of his properties. He shoots himself in the mouth, spattering the wall with rainbow blood, but quickly regenerates and survives. He then meets a child who attempts to befriend him. Kent tries to behead himself with a pair of buzz saws, but a fluke accident causes the saw blades to shatter apart, killing the boy. Kent realizes he wants to eat the child and does so before Meg finds him. Once at home, Kent tells Meg to chain him up in the basement, telling her not to let him out. He learns from Jack that one of his classmates had bullied him at school. Kent finds the bully and eats him.\n\nKarlsson tells Meg that the wearer can remove the suit [[Human cannibalism|only after eating five children]]. She also learns that Karlsson put on the costume to entertain the children at a hospital where his brother Martin worked many years ago. Martin smuggled five terminally ill children to feed the demon to free his brother. When Karlsson was released from the costume, the brothers tried and failed to destroy it.\n\nKent fully succumbs to the demon and sneaks into a local [[Chuck E. Cheese's|Chuck E. Cheese]], where he devours one child in the [[ball pit]] and another in the tube slides. Blood and a severed arm flow down the slide, causing a panic, and the play zone and restaurant are evacuated. Meg finds Kent as Karlsson attempts to decapitate him with an ax. Before Kent can kill Karlsson, Meg tries to communicate with him. Instead, the demon orders her to find and feed him one more child to release Kent. She must bring the fifth child to their \"special place.\" Otherwise, the Cl\u00f6yne will find and kill Jack. However, Meg refuses.\n\nThe Cl\u00f6yne sneaks into the house and kills Meg's father, Walt. Meg fights against him, but the demon attempts to devour their unborn baby from her womb. After cutting the demon's neck, Meg knocks his head off with a hammer and apologizes to Jack for everything. However, due to a muscle still attached to the body, the Cl\u00f6yne revives. Meg finally rips off the demon's head, killing the monster and her husband. While embracing her son, she watches in horror as the Cl\u00f6yne's skin melts away, revealing the decapitated Kent. The film's end shows the costume packed away by the police as evidence.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Eli Roth]] as Frowny the Clown\n* [[Laura Allen]] as Meg McCoy\n* Andy Powers as Kent McCoy\n* [[Peter Stormare]] as Herbert Karlsson\n* [[Elizabeth Whitmere]] as Denise\n* Christian Distefano as Jack McCoy\n* [[Chuck Shamata]] as Walt\n* Robert Reynolds as Dr. Martin Karlsson\n* Lucas Kelly as Colton\n* Michael Riendeau as Robbie\n* Matthew Stefiuk as Detective\n* Miller Timlin as Camper\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Eli Roth 2007.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Eli Roth]] was the film's producer and had a brief cameo as Frowny the Clown]]\n\nIn November 2010, Jon Watts and [[Christopher D. Ford]] uploaded a fake trailer to [[YouTube]] that announced [[Eli Roth]] would produce the film; Roth was not involved at the time. Roth spoke about the film, saying: \"I loved how ballsy they were, issuing a trailer that said, 'From the Master of Horror, Eli Roth.' Some people thought I'd made the movie, or that it was another fake ''[[Grindhouse (film)|Grindhouse]]'' trailer... I really felt these guys deserved a shot, and that people are truly freaked out by evil clowns. It's new territory to make this a version of ''[[The Fly (1986 film)|The Fly]]'', where this guy can feel himself changing, blacking out only to find blood all over his clown suit. You're sympathetic toward a monster until the monster actually takes over.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.slashfilm.com/eli-roth-producing-clown-based-fake-eli-roth-movie-trailer/|title=Eli Roth Producing 'Clown,' Based on Fake Eli Roth Movie Trailer - /Film|work=Slashfilm|accessdate=8 November 2014}}</ref>\n\n[[Principal photography]] began in November 2012 in [[Ottawa]].
