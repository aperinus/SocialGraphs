It was co-written and directed by [[Cameron Crowe]] and stars [[Matt Damon]] as widowed father Benjamin Mee, who purchases a dilapidated zoo with his family and takes on the challenge of preparing the zoo for its reopening to the public. The film also stars [[Scarlett Johansson]], [[Maggie Elizabeth Jones]], [[Thomas Haden Church]], [[Patrick Fugit]], [[Elle Fanning]], [[Colin Ford]], and [[John Michael Higgins]].\n\n''We Bought A Zoo'' was released in the United States on December 21, 2011 by [[20th Century Fox]].<ref name=\"cinemabland20100517\">{{cite web |first=Katey |last = Rich |url=https://www.cinemablend.com/new/Cameron-Crowe-Commits-To-We-Bought-A-Zoo-For-Late-2011-Release-18622.html |title=Cameron Crowe Commits To We Bought A Zoo For Late 2011 Release |access-date=2010-10-29|publisher= Cinema Blend | date=2010-05-17}}</ref> The film earned $120.1 million on a $50 million budget. ''We Bought a Zoo'' was released on DVD and Blu-ray on April 3, 2012 by [[20th Century Fox Home Entertainment]].  [[Dartmoor Zoological Park]] (originally Dartmoor Wildlife Park), on which the film is based, is a 33-acre zoological garden located near the village of [[Sparkwell]], [[Devon]], [[England]].\n\n==Plot==\nBenjamin Mee has been grieving the loss of his wife, Katherine, for seven months. When his 14-year-old son Dylan is [[Expulsion (education)|expelled]] from school, Benjamin realizes that the family's current situation is not working, they are all grieving, and everything around them reminds them of Katherine. Bejnamin decides to make a fresh start, starting with a new home. \n\nHe tours many homes with his 7-year-old daughter, Rosie, and their realtor, Mr. Stevens, but find none to their liking until Rosie sees a listing for a large old house. Mr. Stevens tries to dissuade them from considering it, but as they tour the grounds, Benjamin declares that \"it's perfect\". Stevens explains that if they want the house, then they must also buy the zoo on the property which closed several years before. Benjamin, seeing Rosie playing happily with the [[peafowl|peacocks]], resolves to buy the zoo. \n\nDylan, frustrated by the idea of moving away from his friends, retreats into his art. Benjamin's brother, Duncan, tries to discourage him from the purchase, but he buys it anyway.\n\nThe zoo staff, led by head [[Zookeeper|keeper]] Kelly Foster, start making renovations to reopen the zoo to the public. When Kelly asks Benjamin why he bought the zoo despite knowing nothing about zoo management, he simply responds, \"Why not?\" Meanwhile, Dylan is very unhappy and misses his friends, causing him to retreat further into his art. He is soon befriended by Kelly's 13-year-old [[homeschooling|homeschooled]] cousin, Lily, who develops a crush on him.\n\nWalter Ferris, a strict [[United States Department of Agriculture|USDA]] inspector, arrives for a surprise visit and makes a list of repairs that would cost over $100,000. Benjamin cannot afford the repairs and [[gossip]] spreads that he will probably sell the zoo. The staff's morale sinks, fearing the property will be sold to a buyer that will close it down. Dylan is overjoyed when Lily tells him the rumor about his family leaving, which hurts her feelings. \n\nBenjamin learns that Katherine bequeathed him an investment account with instructions to use the money wisely while listening to his heart. Duncan advises him to walk away and start over with the money, but Benjamin decides to use the money for the repairs.\n\nDylan, unhappy about having to stay, confronts his father and they have a heated argument. They reconcile the next morning and Dylan admits he misses Lily. Benjamin tells Dylan his favorite motto: that you only need 20 seconds of courage for something great to happen. Benjamin realizes that instead of trying to start over by forgetting his wife, he should accept that she will always be a part of him. Dylan, following his father's advice, confesses his love to Lily, and she forgives him.\n\nPrior to the zoo's grand opening, the facility passes a stringent inspection by Ferris, who grudgingly wishes them good luck. They learn that the worst rainstorm in 100 years may wash out the zoo's grand opening. Fortunately, the weather clears by the morning of the grand opening, but they are disappointed when it appears that no one is visiting.\n\nDylan discovers that a fallen tree has blocked the access road with a large crowd of visitors waiting behind it. The staff help everyone climb over the tree, and the attendance is so high that they run out of tickets. Benjamin and Kelly set out to find more and end up face to face in a shed, where Kelly admits that she has a crush on Benjamin and they kiss.\n\nBenjamin takes Dylan and Rosie to the restaurant where he met Katherine. He tells them the story of how he worked up the nerve to approach her table with \"20 seconds of insane courage.\" He visualizes her at the table, and asks why such an amazing woman would talk to someone like him. She responds, \"Why not?\"\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Matt Damon]] as Benjamin Mee, the father of Dylan and Rosie Mee, the owner of the zoo and the love interest of Kelly Foster, who is trying to restart his life after the death of his first wife, Katherine.<ref name=\"moviefone20100624\">{{cite web |first=Scott |last=Harris |url=http://blog.moviefone.com/2010/06/24/matt-damon-we-bought-a-zoo-cameron-crowe |title=Matt Damon May Lead Cameron Crowe's 'We Bought a Zoo' |access-date=2011-10-29 |publisher=Moviefone |date=2010-06-24 |archive-date=2012-04-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120405224755/http://blog.moviefone.com/2010/06/24/matt-damon-we-bought-a-zoo-cameron-crowe |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n* [[Scarlett Johansson]] as Kelly Foster, the 28-year-old lead long-time zookeeper at Rosemoor Animal Park who is Benjamin's love interest and is a mother figure to Dylan and Rosie.\n* [[Thomas Haden Church]] as Duncan Mee,<ref name=\"screenrant81673\">{{cite web| url=https://screenrant.com/thomas-haden-church-killer-joe-we-bought-zoo-sandy-81673 |title=Thomas Haden Church Joins 'Killer Joevbvb' & 'We Bought A Zoo' |access-date=2010-10-29|publisher= ScreenRant }}</ref> Benjamin's older brother and an accountant and Dylan and Rosie's uncle\n* [[Colin Ford]] as Dylan Mee,<ref name=\"cinemabland20101020\">{{cite web |first=Mack |last= Rawden |url=https://www.cinemablend.com/new/Colin-Ford-Cast-As-Matt-Damon-s-Son-In-We-Bought-A-Zoo-21318.html |title=Colin Ford Cast As Matt Damon's Son In We Bought A Zoo |access-date=2011-10-29 |publisher= Cinema Blend | date=2010-10-20}}</ref> Benjamin's 14-year-old son, who is initially drawn to Lily and eventually develops feelings for her and has a strained and rough relationship with his father.\n* [[Maggie Elizabeth Jones]] as Rosie Mee, Benjamin's 7-year-old daughter and Dylan's younger sister, who is very curious about all of the animals in the zoo and thinks living at a zoo is a grand adventure.\n* [[Elle Fanning]] as Lily Miska,<ref name=\"deadline20101109\"/> the 13-year old home-schooled cousin of Kelly and worker at the zoo's restaurant who lives within the zoo.

In the film, it occurred as a result of finding a house they liked.\n\nInstead of an escaping [[grizzly bear]], as portrayed by the film, it was a [[jaguar]] called Sovereign that had escaped.<ref name=\"guardian20070623\"/> Benjamin's children were also younger (aged four and six respectively) than the children in the film.<ref name=\"guardian20070623\"/>\n\nIn the film, the zoo was much easier to buy. In real life, it took almost two years to buy.<ref name=\"guardian20070623\"/> Benjamin's first offer to buy the zoo was rejected due to his lack of experience in the zoological world.<ref name=\"guardian20070623\"/> Finally, the real zoo opened on Saturday July 7, 2007. The movie moved that event up to the same date in 2010. This later date fell on a Wednesday, but was identified in the script as the original Saturday.\n\n== Legacy ==\nThe longtime gag-feud between Matt Damon and Oscars host [[Jimmy Kimmel]] continued at the 89th Academy Awards ceremony, where Kimmel jokingly mocked Damon's performance in the movie.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/matt-damon-oscar-host-jimmy-kimmel-talentless/story?id=45757815|title=Oscars host Jimmy Kimmel slams Matt Damon's 'We Bought a Zoo'|website=[[ABC News]] }}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.dartmoorzoo.org/ Dartmoor Zoological Park official website]\n* {{IMDb title|1389137}}\n* [https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/we_bought_a_zoo/ ''We Bought a Zoo''] at [[Rotten Tomatoes]]\n* {{Mojo title|weboughtazoo|We Bought a Zoo}}\n\n{{Cameron Crowe|state=expanded}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:We Bought A Zoo}}\n[[Category:2011 films]]\n[[Category:2011 comedy-drama films]]\n[[Category:20th Century Fox films]]\n[[Category:American comedy-drama films]]\n[[Category:Comedy-drama films based on actual events]]\n[[Category:Dune Entertainment films]]\n[[Category:Films about animal rights]]\n[[Category:Films about dysfunctional families]]\n[[Category:Films about grieving]]\n[[Category:Films about widowhood]]\n[[Category:Films based on biographies]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Cameron Crowe]]\n[[Category:Films produced by Cameron Crowe]]\n[[Category:Films set in California]]\n[[Category:Films set in zoos]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Los Angeles]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by Aline Brosh McKenna]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by Cameron Crowe]]\n[[Category:Vinyl Films films]]\n[[Category:2010s English-language films]]\n[[Category:2010s American films]]"}]}}}}
