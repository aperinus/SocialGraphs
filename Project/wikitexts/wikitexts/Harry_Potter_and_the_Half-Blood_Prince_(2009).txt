Thank you. -->\n[[Lord Voldemort]] tightens his grip on the wizarding and Muggle worlds: his [[Death Eaters]] kidnap [[Ollivander|Mr Ollivander]] and destroy [[London]]'s [[Millennium Bridge, London|Millennium Bridge]]. With [[Lucius Malfoy]] incarcerated in [[Azkaban]], Voldemort chooses his son, [[Draco Malfoy]], to carry out a secret mission at [[Hogwarts]]. Draco's mother, [[Narcissa Malfoy|Narcissa]], and aunt [[Bellatrix Lestrange]] seek out [[Severus Snape]], who gains their confidence by claiming he is a mole within the [[Order of the Phoenix (fictional organisation)|Order of the Phoenix]]. Snape makes an [[Unbreakable Vow]] with Narcissa to protect Draco and fulfil his task should he fail.\n\n[[Harry Potter (character)|Harry Potter]] accompanies [[Albus Dumbledore]] to persuade former Potions professor [[Horace Slughorn]] to return to Hogwarts. Then, at [[The Burrow (Harry Potter)|the Burrow]], Harry reunites with his best friends [[Ron Weasley]] and [[Hermione Granger]]. In [[Diagon alley|Diagon Alley]], they see Draco and Narcissa Malfoy, and follow them into [[Knockturn Alley]]. The pair meet with Death Eaters, including the werewolf [[Fenrir Greyback]], at Borgin & Burke's. Harry believes Draco is now a Death Eater, but Ron and Hermione are sceptical. On the [[Hogwarts Express]], Harry sneaks into the [[Slytherin]] carriage wearing his [[Magical objects in Harry Potter#Invisibility cloak|Invisibility Cloak]] to spy on Malfoy. Malfoy notices and [[Petrifaction in mythology and fiction|petrifies]] Harry, leaving him on the train.  [[Luna Lovegood]] finds him and counters Draco's spell.\n\nHarry discovers that his used Potions textbook is filled with helpful notes and spells added by the \"Half-Blood Prince\". Using it, Harry excels in class, annoying Hermione and impressing Slughorn, who awards him a [[Felix Felicis|Liquid Luck potion]]. Ron makes the [[Gryffindor]] [[Quidditch]] team as Keeper and begins dating [[Lavender Brown (Harry Potter)|Lavender Brown]], upsetting Hermione. Harry consoles Hermione while acknowledging his own feelings for [[Ginny Weasley]]. Harry spends the Christmas holidays with the Weasleys. His suspicions about Draco are dismissed by the Order, but [[Arthur Weasley]] reveals that the Malfoys may be interested in a [[Magical Objects in Harry Potter#Vanishing Cabinet|Vanishing Cabinet]] at Borgin & Burke's. Bellatrix and Greyback attack and destroy the Burrow.\n\nAt Hogwarts, Dumbledore asks Harry to retrieve Slughorn's memory of a young Voldemort. Slughorn has resisted giving an accurate memory. After Ron accidentally ingests a [[Amortentia|love potion]] intended for Harry, Harry takes him to Slughorn for a cure. Slughorn offers the boys some [[mead]] he had intended as a gift to Dumbledore. Ron is poisoned upon sipping it. Harry's quick thinking saves Ron. While recovering in the infirmary, Ron murmurs Hermione's name, causing Lavender to end their relationship. Harry confronts Draco about the poisoned mead and also a cursed necklace that nearly killed Katie Bell. A duel erupts, and Harry uses one of the Half-Blood Prince's curses without knowing what it is. The curse severely injures Malfoy, and he is only saved by Snape's timely arrival and reversal of the curse. Fearing the book contains [[Dark Magic]], Ginny persuades Harry to hide it in the [[Room of Requirement]]. They then share their first kiss.\n\nHarry uses his Liquid Luck potion to convince the reluctant Slughorn to surrender the memory Dumbledore needs. Viewing it in the Penseive, Dumbledore and Harry learn Voldemort sought information about [[Horcrux]]es, magical objects containing pieces of a wizard's soul for immortality. Dumbledore surmises Voldemort divided his soul into six Horcruxes, two of which have been destroyed: [[Tom Riddle's diary]] and [[Magical objects in Harry Potter#Marvolo Gaunt's ring|Marvolo Gaunt's ring]]. They travel to a cave where Harry aids Dumbledore in drinking a potion that hides another Horcrux, [[Magical objects in Harry Potter#Salazar Slytherin's locket|Slytherin's locket]].\n\nA weakened Dumbledore defends them from [[Inferius|Inferi]] by creating a ring of fire, and [[apparate]]s them back to Hogwarts, where Bellatrix, Greyback, and other Death Eaters have entered through the Vanishing Cabinet in the Room of Requirement that Draco has secretly connected to one in Knockturn Alley. As Harry hides, Draco appears and disarms the headmaster, revealing Voldemort chose him to kill Dumbledore. Draco hesitates; Snape, however, arrives and kills Dumbledore. As the Death Eaters escape, Snape reveals to Harry that he is the Half-Blood Prince.\n\nAs Hogwarts students and staff mourn Dumbledore's death, Harry tells Ron and Hermione that the locket is fake and contains a message from \"[[Regulus Black|R.A.B.]]\", who stole the real Horcrux intending to destroy it. Harry, Ron and Hermione agree to forgo their final Hogwarts year to hunt for the remaining Horcruxes.\n\n==Cast==\n{{further|List of Harry Potter cast members}}\n\n* [[Daniel Radcliffe]] as [[Harry Potter (character)|Harry Potter]]: A 16-year-old British [[Magician (fantasy)|wizard]] who now enters his sixth year at [[Hogwarts|Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]]\n* [[Rupert Grint]] as [[Ron Weasley]]: One of Harry's two best friends\n* [[Emma Watson]] as [[Hermione Granger]]: One of Harry's two best friends\n* [[Bonnie Wright]] as [[Ginny Weasley]]: Ron's sister and Harry's girlfriend\n* [[Helena Bonham Carter]] as [[Bellatrix Lestrange]]: One of Voldemort's principal [[Death Eaters]] and Draco Malfoy's aunt\n* [[Jim Broadbent]] as [[Horace Slughorn]]: The newly appointed Potions master who had held the position before Severus Snape\n* [[Robbie Coltrane]] as [[Rubeus Hagrid]]: The Hogwarts gamekeeper and [[Hogwarts subjects|Care of Magical Creatures]] teacher at Hogwarts\n* [[Warwick Davis]] as [[Filius Flitwick]]: The Charms master and head of Ravenclaw\n* [[Tom Felton]] as [[Draco Malfoy]]:<!--Felton is ''not'' credited as \"main cast\" in the poster or film credits, but has won awards because of his portrayal of Malfoy.

In an interview with [[Academy Awards|the Academy]], Delbonnel said that he did not want to change the lighting effects used in the previous films, and finally decided to give it a darker, moody variation of grey. Yates and the other producers supported this new effect, and he went ahead with it. In reference to the cave scene, Delbonnel said, \"I wanted to have some kind of 'dynamism' with the light. I thought it could be interesting and more dramatic if the light was floating, circling above the characters faces: sometimes lighting them, sometimes hiding them in a very random and unpredictable way.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://oscar.go.com/html/util/question.html?img=Cinematography_HarryPotterAndTheHalfBloodPrince |title=Nominations Questionnaire: Bruno Delbonnel |access-date=24 February 2010}}</ref>\n\n===Visual effects===\nThe opening scenes of the Death Eaters' attack on Diagon Alley and London was created by [[DNEG|Double Negative]], led by [[Visual effects|VFX]] supervisor [[Paul Franklin (visual effects supervisor)|Paul Franklin]].

Tim Alexander said that completing the [[Inferius|Inferi]]-attack scene took several months. He said that the scene was much bolder and scarier compared to previous films, and director Yates wanted to avoid making them look like [[zombie]]s. On differentiating them, he commented, \"A lot of it came down to their movement \u2013 they don't move fast, but they don't move really slow or groan and moan. We ended up going with a very realistic style.\" He also noted that Inferi are skinnier than zombies, waterlogged and grey.<ref>{{cite news |date=18 June 2009 |title='Harry Potter' countdown: Scaring up the Inferi |work=Los Angeles Times |url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/herocomplex/2009/06/harry-potter-countdown-scaring-up-the-inferi.html |access-date=1 August 2009}}</ref>\n\nOn Dumbledore's ring of fire to combat the Inferi, he added that research was done on molten volcanoes, among other references.
