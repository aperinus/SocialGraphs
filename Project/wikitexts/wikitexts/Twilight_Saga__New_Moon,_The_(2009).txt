Despite her lack of enthusiasm, Edward's family host a birthday reception for her at their residence. While unwrapping a gift, she receives a paper cut. Edward's foster brother, [[Jasper Hale|Jasper]], is overwhelmed by the scent of Bella's blood and attempts to attack her but is restrained. Believing that he and his family are putting her life in danger, Edward ends their relationship, and the Cullens leave Forks.\n\nBella is left severely [[Depression (mood)|depressed]] and [[Social isolation|isolated]] for months. Her concerned father, [[Charlie Swan (Twilight)|Charlie]], wants to send Bella to live with her mother in [[Jacksonville, Florida]]. She refuses, promising to spend more time with her other school friends. After she and [[Jessica Stanley|Jessica]] see a movie, Bella approaches some rough-looking bikers outside the theater, much to Jessica's dismay. The dangerous encounter reminds Bella of a previous near-assault where Edward rescued her. She imagines seeing and hearing him and realizes that thrill-seeking activities evoke his image.\n\nBella's [[Quileute]] friend [[Jacob Black]] helps ease her pain by engaging her in various activities. He says that many of his tribal friends follow and obey Sam, another Quileute. While attending a movie with Bella and Mike, Jacob abruptly leaves after becoming inexplicably upset and suffering a burning fever. Bella drives to his home after he avoids seeing her. Jacob has cut his long hair and now has the same Quileute tattoo on his upper right arm as Sam and other tribe members. He tells Bella to stay away.\n\nWhen Bella hikes to the meadow that she and Edward often visited, she is confronted by Victoria's vampire companion Laurent. As he is about to kill her, a wolf pack appears and attacks him. Bella eventually discovers that Jacob and the other tribe members are giant [[werewolf|werewolves]]. Their age-old enemies are vampires, though a treaty exists between the Cullens and the tribe. Jacob's pack members are currently on alert for [[Victoria (Twilight)|Victoria]], the vampire seeking to avenge her mate, James, whom Edward killed to protect Bella. With Jacob focused on adapting to his new shape-shifting powers, Bella again finds herself alone and returns to seeking thrill-inducing activities, deliberately oblivious to Victoria's presence.\n\nThrough a series of miscommunications, Edward believes that Bella has killed herself after Edward's sister [[Alice Cullen (Character)|Alice]] has a vision of Bella [[suicide attempt|jumping off a seaside cliff]]. Distraught, Edward travels to [[Italy]] to ask the [[Volturi]] (a powerful coven that act as vampiric overlords) to end his life, as he is incapable of doing so himself. When they refuse his request, he plans to force their hand by exposing himself as a vampire to humans during a large festival. Alice returns to Forks, shocked to find Bella is still alive.\n\nAlice and Bella travel to Italy to save Edward, arriving in time to prevent him from revealing himself as a vampire. Overjoyed that Bella is alive, he confesses that he left Forks, out of concern for her and promises never to leave again. Edward defends Bella from Felix, one of the Volturi, as the Volturi do not allow humans to confide in vampire society, but Edward is easily overpowered. As the Volturi are about to kill him, Bella asks they kill her instead.\n\nImpressed by a human's willingness to sacrifice her life for a vampire, the Volturi determine that Bella, knowing that vampires exist, must either be killed or be transformed into a vampire. Alice shares her vision of Bella as a vampire with [[Aro (Twilight)|Aro]], a Volturi elder able to read thoughts through touch. Aro decides to let them go after extracting a promise that Bella be turned eventually. After returning to Forks, Bella asks the Cullens to vote on her becoming a vampire. Much to Edward and Rosalie\u2019s chagrin, everyone votes yes.\n\nJacob reminds Edward that the years-old treaty with Quileute will be broken if any Cullen bites a human, but Bella tells Jacob it is her choice, not the Cullen\u2019s.\n\nAt the meadows, Edward admits that he will only let Bella transform into a vampire, if she agrees to marry him. Initially Bella refuses, but contemplates afterwards (serving as the drive of the plot for the [[The Twilight Saga: Eclipse |next movie]]).\n\n==Cast==\n{{See also|List of Twilight cast members}}\n{{div col|colwidth=25em}}\n* [[Kristen Stewart]] as [[Bella Swan]], a teenage girl who falls into a deep depression after her true love, Edward Cullen, leaves her.

The director noted that, \"The square becomes a flood of red, that's how conscious we were of every visual aspect.\"<ref name=\"Vaz-38\">{{harvnb|Cotta Vaz|2009|page=38}}</ref>\n\nThe use of film, rather than digital, cameras added to the \"old-fashioned\" nature of the production.<ref name=\"Vaz-38\"/> Two main [[Panavision]] cameras, a high-speed Arri 435 camera capable of shooting at 150 frames per second, a [[Steadicam]], and [[VistaVision]] cameras for visual effect shots were among the equipment used to bring the book to the big screen.<ref name=\"Vaz-38\"/> As with the use of specific colors, the different cameras and shooting setups would help serve the story points.<ref name=\"Vaz-38\"/> When Bella was with Edward, the camera was moved on a dolly, in a very rigid, straight line to reflect how their relationship was \"perfect\". When Bella is with Jacob, the Steadicam provided a fluid and organic style; and when she is with her schoolmates, a slangy visual language was reflected by a handheld.<ref name=\"Vaz-38\"/>\n\nOnce the film went into production, the decision to shoot in Vancouver, rather than in [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]], came after debate on how to match the locations that were introduced in the first film.<ref name=\"Vaz-41\">{{harvnb|Cotta Vaz|2009|page=41}}</ref> One member involved in the decision process pointed out that Vancouver had been scouted as a potential setting for ''Twilight'', and it was only because the [[U.S. dollar]] had, at that time, dropped below the [[Canadian dollar]] that Oregon drew ''Twilight'' principal photography to Portland and its surrounding areas.<ref name=\"Vaz-41/42\">{{harvnb|Cotta Vaz|2009|pages=41\u201342}}</ref> Vancouver was chosen because it allowed a higher production value, while the surrounding areas contained beautiful forests and gray weather.<ref name=\"Vaz-42\">{{harvnb|Cotta Vaz|2009|page=42}}</ref> With this decision, however, came the issue of reconstructing key sets that were used in the first film. For the exterior of Forks High School, crew members were able to find a parking lot, but the school's steps needed to be filmed with a greenscreen backing to match those that were originally presented in ''Twilight''.<ref name=\"Vaz-44\">{{harvnb|Cotta Vaz|2009|page=44}}</ref> [[David Thompson Secondary School (Vancouver)|David Thompson Secondary School]] would then be able to serve as the interior for the high school scenes.<ref name=HighSchool>{{cite web | title=Twilight stars filming New Moon at Vancouver high school | url=https://vancouversun.com/sports/Twilight+stars+filming+Moon+Vancouver+high+school/1471218/story.html | work=The Vancouver Sun | publisher=Canwest Publishing Inc | date=2009-04-07 | access-date=2009-04-07 | url-status=dead | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090410073148/http://www.vancouversun.com/Sports/Twilight+stars+filming+Moon+Vancouver+high+school/1471218/story.html | archive-date=2009-04-10 }}</ref>\n\nThe Cullen house was one of the major \"match\" assignments, mainly because of the Portland area location's unique design.<ref name=\"Vaz-44\"/> The production team agreed upon finding a house in the Vancouver area with an interior that emulated the high ceilings, glass walls, and forest surroundings of the first location. One location was positively compared to the one in Portland, and therefore Weitz and the production team filmed portions of the film there.<ref name=\"Vaz-44\"/> In order to keep with the design of the original house, portions of the story that took place in ''New Moon'' were moved to different sections of the house that were not seen before.<ref name=\"Vaz-44\"/>\n\n[[Image:New moon jacobs house1.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Jacob's house as depicted in ''The Twilight Saga: New Moon'']]\nAfter scouting Vancouver for a place to film scenes that involved the Swan house, the decision was made to recreate the house on an empty lot with a tree line and approaching road.<ref name=\"Vaz-48/57\">{{harvnb|Cotta Vaz|2009|page=48\u201357}}</ref> The production team was able to rearrange the exterior of the house to match that in the first movie.<ref name=\"Vaz-48/57\"/> When faced with creating the interior, the team measured the house in Portland, and built various pieces of the house on the lot and on a stage in Vancouver.<ref name=\"Vaz-48/57\"/> The second film also attempted to clarify the location of Bella's room, which, as seen in the first film, seemed to be located in the front of the house, when in reality it was on the right-hand side.<ref name=\"Vaz-48/57\"/> Complications arose when the Portland house was repainted after ''Twilight''{{'}}s release, which took away the aging the house had come to depict in the film. When recreating the house, the production team referenced the first film on high-definition [[Blu-ray]] Disc.<ref name=\"Vaz-48/57\"/>\n\nAs a director, Weitz had the pleasure of introducing and filming on new locations and sets. Of particular interest was the Quileute reservation and Jacob's house.<ref name=\"Vaz-64/66\">{{harvnb|Cotta Vaz|2009|pages=64\u201366}}</ref> Using the Quileute country in Washington as a basis, the production team decided to place Jacob's house on the edges of the territory, rather than in the community, because of Jacob's attachment to the wolves.<ref name=\"Vaz-64/66\"/> To Weitz, Jacob's house was the stepping stone into the forest world, where the reality of the werewolves is hidden. The production designer was faced with a \"real world\" versus \"book world\" challenge when the barn they located, described in the book as a red barn, was green.<ref name=\"Vaz-64/66\"/> Initially bordered by a green fence, the decision of painting the barn, aging it, and renovating the exterior proved to be a layout that fit well with Jacob's character.<ref name=\"Vaz-64/66\"/>\n\nAfter scouting more than twelve possible locations to film scenes that would take place in [[Volterra]], Italy, the scouting team selected the town of [[Montepulciano]], which they believe was the best representation of Meyer's description in the book.<ref name=\"Vaz-114\">{{harvnb|Cotta Vaz|2009|page=114}}</ref> Principal photography concluded with the scenes that were filmed in this area from May 25 through the 29.<ref name=\"Montepulciano1\">{{cite web|last=Detassis|first=Piera|title=New Moon: No a Volterra|publisher=Piera Detassis|date=2009-03-15|url=http://piaceriforti.blogspot.com/2009/03/new-moon-no-volterra.html|access-date=2009-03-28|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090318231530/http://piaceriforti.blogspot.com/2009/03/new-moon-no-volterra.html|archive-date=2009-03-18}}</ref><ref name=\"Montepulciano2\">{{cite web|title=Montepulciano 'the most beautiful place to film'...|publisher=Strada del Vino Nobile di Montepulciano|url=http://www.stradavinonobile.it/new/evento.en.php|access-date=2009-03-28|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090401075648/http://www.stradavinonobile.it/new/evento.en.php|archive-date=2009-04-01}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.twilightnews.co.uk/2009/04/23/new-moon-filming-in-italy-may-25-29/ |title=New Moon Filming In Italy May 25\u201329 |publisher=Twilight News |access-date=2010-08-05 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110911061719/http://www.twilightnews.co.uk/2009/04/23/new-moon-filming-in-italy-may-25-29/ |archive-date=2011-09-11 }}</ref><ref name=\"Vaz-118\">{{harvnb|Cotta Vaz|2009|page=118}}</ref> For the face-off between the Volturi and Edward, the idea was to have a bigger \"bang\", rather than just the paralysis of Edward.<ref name=\"Vaz-122/127\">{{harvnb|Cotta Vaz|2009|page=122\u2013127}}</ref> Initially what was a huge battle with vampires being thrown everywhere turned into a one-on-one fight between Felix and Edward, after receiving a stamp of approval from Meyer.<ref name=\"Vaz-122/127\"/> The idea quickly changed from the typical outlandish battle, to portraying Edward as an average guy caught in the middle of a bad situation; for Bella, conveying the feeling of being caught in the middle of a group of vampires fighting was important as well.<ref name=\"Vaz-122/127\"/> This scene also required special effects, stunt work, and figuring out how to portray vampires fighting at very fast speeds.<ref name=\"Vaz-122/127\"/>\n\n===Visual effects===\nOverseeing the visual effects department for ''New Moon'' was Susan MacLeod, who had previously worked with Weitz during the production of ''The Golden Compass''.<ref name=\"Vaz-25\">{{harvnb|Cotta Vaz|2009|page=25}}</ref> MacLeod enlisted [[Tippett Studio]] to create the computer-generated wolves, while Prime Focus of Vancouver handled the effects of the vampires.<ref name=\"Vaz-25\"/> To prepare for the aggressive task of making the wolves look real, Tippet artists studied wolf culture.<ref name=\"Vaz-84/87\">{{harvnb|Cotta Vaz|2009|pages=84\u201387}}</ref> They also were able to reflect leadership and human muscle size by adjusting certain features of the wolves, such as their fat and height.<ref name=\"Vaz-84/87\"/> In February 2009, a group of artists were able to travel to Wolf Mountain Sanctuary, outside of [[Los Angeles]], and see real wolves.<ref name=\"Vaz-84/87\"/> The artists were able to observe the behavior of both the [[Gray wolf|timber]] and [[Arctic wolf|arctic]] wolves, who ran in packs of three to five. The idea was to give everyone a deeper feeling of the creature that they were creating.<ref name=\"Vaz-84/87\"/>\n\n[[Image:NMwolf.jpg|thumb|200px|One of the scenes Tippett Studio was responsible for animating]]\nMacLeod explained that creating the shape-shifting werewolves was not an easy task.<ref name=\"Vas-82/86\">{{harvnb|Cotta Vaz|2009|pages=82\u201386}}</ref> The wolf work included shooting \"plates\", or photographic imagery into which CG creations are integrated. Since the book described the wolves as being as big as horses, full-scale aluminum and board wolf cutouts were used as a visual reference for both actors and crew members.<ref name=\"Vas-82/86\"/> Once the actors had a reference, the cutouts would be removed allowing the cameras to capture the scene.<ref name=\"Vas-82/86\"/> In order for the CG wolves to be in sync with the live action cameras and actors' movements, the team used match movers, a land surveying tool that recorded the shooting location's topography with reference marks.<ref name=\"Vas-82/86\"/>\n\nA raw 3D model of Jacob's wolf was the basis for creating the others.<ref name=\"Vas-89\">{{harvnb|Cotta Vaz|2009|page=89}}</ref> A muscle system, which gave the appearance of muscles firing and flexing, contributed to this model. From there, the initial fur layout went to painters who were responsible for its color and groom.<ref name=\"Vas-89\"/> They also added characteristics, such as wet hair clumping together, and applied it to the fur. They refined this look before passing it off to the lighting and technical directors.<ref name=\"Vas-89\"/>\n\nOne challenge for the production team was how to convey Bella's depression once Edward departs. In the novel, these pages were filled with the names of the passing months, and in the movie, would be represented as a visual effects shot with a camera circling around [[Kristen Stewart]].<ref name=\"Vaz-48/57\"/> The window that was used for the original film did not quite fit what Weitz was looking for, so the production team created a bay window when recreating the Swan house.<ref name=\"Vaz-48/57\"/> The effect was one of the 300 visual effects helmed by Prime Focus led by visual effects supervisor [[Eric Pascarelli]]. It required matching two camera shots: one that shot the actress in a chair, and the other shooting the view outside the window as seen from the house built on location.<ref name=\"Vaz-48/57\"/> Using a greenscreen, Prime Focus was able to enhance the changing of seasons with computer-generated leaves and falling snow.<ref name=\"Vaz-48/57\"/>\n\n===Music===\n{{Main|The Twilight Saga: New Moon (soundtrack)}}\n\nThe score for ''New Moon'' was composed by [[Alexandre Desplat]]<ref name=Desplat>{{cite news | author=Alex Billington | title=Alexandre Desplat is Scoring Twilight Saga: New Moon?! | url=http://www.firstshowing.net/2009/04/24/alexandre-desplat-is-scoring-twilight-saga-new-moon/ | publisher=First Showing | date=2009-04-24 | access-date=2009-05-04 | url-status=live | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090427141127/http://www.firstshowing.net/2009/04/24/alexandre-desplat-is-scoring-twilight-saga-new-moon/ | archive-date=2009-04-27 }}</ref> while the rest of the soundtrack was chosen by music supervisor [[Alexandra Patsavas]], who also produced the [[Twilight (soundtrack)|''Twilight'' soundtrack]].<ref name=\"DeathCab\">{{cite magazine |author=David J.
