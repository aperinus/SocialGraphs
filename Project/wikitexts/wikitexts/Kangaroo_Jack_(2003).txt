Pictures]], directed by [[David McNally (director)|David McNally]] with a screenplay by [[Steve Bing]] and [[Scott Rosenberg]] from a story by Bing and [[Barry O'Brien]]. The film is produced by [[Jerry Bruckheimer]] with music by [[Trevor Rabin]] and stars [[Jerry O'Connell]], [[Anthony Anderson]], [[Estella Warren]], [[Michael Shannon]], and [[Christopher Walken]], with [[Adam Garcia]] as the uncredited voice of the titular character.\n\n''Kangaroo Jack'' was theatrically released on January 17, 2003. The film grossed $88.1 million worldwide on a $60 million budget, but was universally panned by critics, who criticized the acting, directing, writing, humor, violence, and innuendoes, especially for a family film, and [[false advertising]], although the visuals and soundtrack were praised. ''Kangaroo Jack'' was released on DVD and VHS on June 24, 2003, by [[Warner Home Video]].\n\nAn animated sequel titled ''[[Kangaroo Jack: G'Day U.S.A.!]]'' was produced and released on video in 2004.\n\n== Plot ==\nIn 1982 [[Brooklyn]], a boy named Charlie Carbone is about to become the stepson of a [[crime boss]] named Salvatore Maggio. The mobster's apprentice Frankie Lombardo tries to drown Charlie, but a boy named Louis Booker saves him, and they become friends.\n\nTwenty years later, Charlie is running his own beauty salon set up by Sal, who\u2019s henchmen take 80% of the salon's profits, barely leaving Charlie enough money for maintenance. After they botch the job of hiding some stolen TVs, Sal gives Charlie and Louis one more chance. Under instructions from Frankie, they are to deliver a package to a man named Mr. Smith in [[Coober Pedy]], [[Australia]]. Frankie also warns them against opening the package, and provides them with Mr. Smith's number. Unbeknown to the duo, Sal has cancelled their return trip. Louis opens the package on the plane and finds $50,000 cash.\n\nUpon landing in Australia, Charlie and Louis rent a car and head to Coober Pedy. Along their way, they accidentally run over a [[red kangaroo]]. Louis thinks it is dead and puts his jacket and sunglasses on the kangaroo and poses for photographs as a joke, saying the kangaroo looks like one of Sal's henchmen. The kangaroo suddenly regains consciousness, kicks Charlie, and hops away with the $50,000 in the jacket. Charlie and Louis take chase, but crash the car, and the kangaroo escapes.\n\nAt a pub in [[Alice Springs]], Louis manages to call Mr. Smith and tries to explain their situation. Mr. Smith, however, thinks they stole his package and threatens to kill Louis and Charlie. Back in New York, Sal gets the call from Mr. Smith complaining that Charlie and Louis haven't arrived; Sal then sends Frankie and some henchmen to Australia to investigate. Meanwhile, Charlie and Louis attempt to reclaim the money from the kangaroo by shooting it with a tranquilizer in a plane. The attempt fails when Louis accidentally shoots Blue, the pilot, and strands the duo in the desert. They spend hours wandering in the desert, during which Charlie [[hallucination|hallucinates]] finding a jeep, and they soon meet an American woman named Jessie from the Outback Wildlife Foundation.\n\nThe following day, the trio then track the kangaroo to the [[Todd River]] and try again to catch it with [[bolas]], but Louis accidentally botches their attempt when ants crawl up his pants. While waiting for the next opportunity to catch the kangaroo, Charlie begins developing feelings for Jessie. Mr. Smith and his henchmen shortly arrive and capture the trio. Charlie and Louis outsmart them, but find Frankie has tracked them down and is prepared to kill them. The kangaroo suddenly returns, causing a [[Boxing|fist fight]] between Mr. Smith's henchmen and Frankie's crew, who outmatch them. The distraction allows Charlie, Louis and Jessie to escape. A final chase ensues, with the duo chasing after the kangaroo while being pursued by Frankie and his goons. Louis finally manages to retrieve the money from the kangaroo but nearly falls off a cliff and is narrowly saved by Charlie. Charlie tries to hand the money to Frankie, but the latter angrily declines and reveals that Sal sent them to Australia to pay for their own execution at the hands of Mr. Smith. The [[Australian Federal Police|police force]] led by an undercover cop (disguised as an Outback guide) arrive and arrest Frankie, Mr. Smith, and their henchmen. Charlie reclaims Louis' jacket from the kangaroo.\n\nOne year later, Charlie and Jessie are married and have used Sal's $50,000 to start a line of new hair care products bearing a kangaroo logo, along with Louis. Frankie, Mr. Smith, and their men have been [[Life imprisonment|imprisoned for life]], a punishment that Sal had also failed at avoiding. The kangaroo, now called \"Kangaroo Jack\", is also revealed to be living happily in the [[Outback]]. Now able to speak again, Jack breaks the fourth wall, explaining why the film should end with him and closes it with his version of [[Porky Pig]]'s famous catchphrase \"That's all, blokes!\"\n\n== Cast ==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Jerry O'Connell]] as Charlie Carbone, the owner of a beauty salon.\n** Robert Reid as young Charlie Carbone\n* [[Anthony Anderson]] as Louis Booker, the best friend of Charlie.
