It stars [[Lee Young-ae]] as Lee Geum-ja, a woman released from prison after serving the sentence for a murder she did not commit. The film tells her story of revenge against the real murderer.\n\nThe film debuted on 29 July 2005 in South Korea, and competed for the Golden Lion at the [[62nd Venice International Film Festival]] in September 2005. While it failed to win in competition, it did walk away with Cinema of The Future, the Young Lion Award, and the Best Innovated Film Award in the non-competition section. It won the award for Best Film at the 26th [[Blue Dragon Film Awards]]. The film had its US premiere on 30 September 2005 at the New York Film Festival. It began its limited release in North American theatres on 5 May 2006, to favorable reviews from critics.\n\n==Plot==\nA [[Christianity|Christian]] musical procession waits with a symbolic block of [[tofu]] outside a prison for the release of Lee Geum-ja ([[Lee Young-ae]]), a reformed female prisoner. Convicted of kidnapping and murdering a 6-year-old schoolboy, Won-mo, 13 years earlier, Geum-ja became a national sensation because of her young age, angelic appearance, and eager confession to the crime. However, she became an inspirational model for prisoner reform during her incarceration, and her apparent spiritual transformation earned her an early release. Free, she is now intent on revenge.\n\nGeum-ja quickly shows that her \"kind-hearted\" behavior in prison was a cover to earn favor and further her revenge plans. She visits the other paroled inmates, calling in favors that include food, shelter, and weapons. She begins work in a pastry shop and starts an affair with a young shop assistant, Geun-Shik, who would be the same age as Won-mo, had he lived.\n\nIt is revealed that Geum-ja did not smother Won-mo. The detective on her case was aware of her innocence, but helped her fake crime-scene details to ensure her confession looked credible. As a young high school student, Geum-ja had become pregnant and, afraid to go home to her parents, turned to Mr. Baek ([[Choi Min-sik]]), a teacher from her school, for help. Mr. Baek expected Geum-ja to provide sex and assist in his kidnapping racket in return. He used her to lure 5-year-old Won-mo to him, with the intent of ransoming the child, but murdered the boy. He then kidnapped Geum-ja's infant daughter and threatened to murder the baby if Geum-ja did not take the blame. She has spent her time in prison planning revenge on Mr. Baek for the murder of Won-mo, causing Geum-ja's child to grow up without a mother, and for sending her to prison.\n    \nGeum-ja discovers that her daughter was adopted by Australian parents. Jenny, now an adolescent, does not speak Korean and does not initially embrace her mother, though she does return with Geum-ja to [[Seoul]] to bond. Geum-ja plans to kidnap and murder Mr. Baek, now a children's teacher at a preschool, with the aid of his wife, another ex-convict. Mr. Baek hires thugs to kill Geum-ja and Jenny but Geum-ja kills them and Mr. Baek is subdued.\n\nMr. Baek wakes up tied to a chair in an abandoned schoolhouse. On his cell phone strap, Geum-ja discovers the orange marble from Won-mo's crime scene, which had been taken as a trophy, and is horrified to see other children's trinkets also on the strap. After shooting him in both feet, she discovers [[Snuff film|snuff]] [[Videotape|tapes]] in his apartment of the other children he had murdered. He had not been part of a ransoming racket; he would kidnap and murder a child from each school he worked at because he found them annoying. After killing each one, he would fake a ransom call to the parents, collect the money, and move on to a different school.\n\nSickened that four more children died because Geum-ja did not turn in the real killer 13 years ago, Geum-ja and the original case detective contact the parents and relatives of the missing children to the school. After watching each tape, the group decides to murder Mr. Baek together. They take turns beating, mutilating and torturing him until he is dead, then take a group photo, ensuring that none of them can turn in the others without implicating themselves. They then bury the corpse outside.\n\nGeum-ja, the detective, and the relatives all converge at Geum-ja's bakery. Afterward, she sees the ghost of the murdered child who then transforms into his grown self (the age that he would have been if he had lived). Later, she meets Jenny and instructs her daughter to live purely, like tofu. She buries her face in an all white frosting covered cake and weeps as Jenny hugs her.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Lee Young-ae]] as Lee Geum-ja\n* [[Choi Min-sik]] as Mr. Baek (Baek Han-sang)\n* Kwon Yea-young as Jenny\n* [[Kim Si-hoo]] as Geun-shik\n* [[Oh Dal-su]] as Mr. Chang\n* Lee Seung-shin as Park Yi-jeong\n* [[Go Soo-hee]] as Ma-nyeo (\"Witch\")\n* [[Kim Byeong-ok]] as The Preacher\n* [[Ra Mi-ran]] as Oh Su-hee\n* Seo Young-ju as Kim Yang-hee\n* Kim Boo-seon as Woo So-young\n* [[Ko Chang-seok]] as So-young's husband\n* [[Lee Dae-yeon]] as parent of abducted child\n* Nam Il-woo as Detective Choi\n* Kim Hee-soo as Se-hyun\n* [[Oh Kwang-rok]] as Se-hyun's father\n* [[Lee Byung-joon]] as Dong-hwa\n* [[Choi Jung-woo]] as Dong-hwa's father\n* [[Ryoo Seung-wan]] as passerby\n* [[Song Kang-ho]] as assassin 1\n* [[Shin Ha-kyun]] as assassin 2\n* [[Yoo Ji-tae]] as grown-up Won-mo, as seen in a vision\n* [[Seo Ji-hee]] as Eun-joo\n* Won Mi-won as Eun-joo's grandmother\n* Kim Ik-tae as Won-mo's father\n* [[Kim Yoo-jung]] as Jae-kyung\n* Im Soo-kyung as prison officer\n* Choi Hee-jin as prisoner 3\n* Jeon Sung-ae as prisoner 4\n* Kim Jin-goo as Ko Seon-sook\n* [[Kang Hye-jung]] as TV announcer\n* [[Tony Barry]] as Jenny's adoptive father\n* Anne Cordiner as Jenny's adoptive mother\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n===Music===\nThe [[Film score|film's score]], composed by [[Choi Seung-hyun]], is heavily baroque-themed, featuring many pieces with harpsichord, baroque guitars, and other instruments. The main theme is an edited version of [[Antonio Vivaldi|Vivaldi's]] \"Ah ch'infelice sempre\" from \"[[Cessate, omai cessate]]\". The song is appropriate since the unedited version's melody is sung by a woman who is seeking revenge on a man who has betrayed her, much like the film itself. The 24th Caprice by [[Paganini]] also appears many times. The final scene is accompanied by an arrangement by [[Jordi Savall]] of the Spanish song ''Mareta'', a lullaby in the [[Valencian language]] by an anonymous 17th century composer from [[Alicante]].\n\n===Fade to Black and White version===\nTwo versions of the film exist, the standard version and the \"Fade to Black and White version\". The latter version begins in full colour, but throughout the film the colour gradually fades until it is totally black and white at the end of the film.<ref>{{Cite web  | last =Ian  | first =Jane | title =Sympathy for Lady Vengeance DTS Limited Edition (Region 3)  | work =DVD Talk  | date =16 January 2006 | url =http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/19729/sympathy-for-lady-vengeance-dts-limited-edition/| access-date = 2011-09-13}}</ref> In conjunction with the camera technique of removing the colours, there is also a change in the environmental colours used in backgrounds and clothing. At the beginning of the film, the environments contain a lot of primary colours, whereas toward the end of the film pastel shades, blacks and whites are used. Geum-ja wears a blue coat in the early part of the film, but this is replaced with a black leather coat at the end. The brightly coloured walls of the prison and Geum-ja's bedroom are replaced with the grey walls of the school.\n\nBoth versions of the film were shown in Korean cinemas, although the fading version was presented only in digital format at a few DLP-equipped multiplexes.\n\nThis version has since been made available on the Korean Special Edition DVD of ''Lady Vengeance'' (with [[Digital Theatre System|DTS]] audio only), and in the [[Tartan Films]] DVD and Blu-ray boxset releases of the Vengeance trilogy. On the Tartan boxset packaging, the version is incorrectly titled \"Fade to White version\".\n\n==Release==\n===Box office===\n''Lady Vengeance'' opened in Korea on 29 July 2005 to blockbuster business, grossing {{USD|7,382,034}} in its opening weekend and grossed a total of {{USD|22,590,402}} in South Korea alone.<ref name=mojo /> In terms of total admissions, it was the seventh biggest domestic release in Korea that year, and the eighth biggest overall with 3,650,000 tickets sold nationwide.<ref>{{cite web|title=Commercial Releases in 2005: Box-Office Results|url=http://www.koreanfilm.org/films2005.html#boxoffice|work=Koreanfilm.org|access-date=2014-02-11}}</ref> It achieved great financial success.<ref>Kim, Yong-jin (2007). \"Park Chan-wook\".
