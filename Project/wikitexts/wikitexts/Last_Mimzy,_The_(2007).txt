It was loosely based upon the 1943 science fiction [[short story]] \"[[Mimsy Were the Borogoves]]\" by [[Lewis Padgett]] (a [[pseudonym]] of husband-and-wife team [[Henry Kuttner]] and [[C. L. Moore]]). The film features [[Timothy Hutton]], [[Joely Richardson]], [[Rainn Wilson]], [[Kathryn Hahn]], [[Michael Clarke Duncan]], and introduces [[Rhiannon Leigh Wryn]] as seven-year-old Emma Wilder and Chris O\u2019Neil as ten-year-old Noah.\n\n==Plot==\nA scientist in the distant future has set out to avert a catastrophic [[ecological disaster]], and sends a small number of [[high tech]] devices that resemble [[toy]]s back in time to modern day [[Seattle]]. Here, they are discovered by two children: Noah Wilder and his younger sister, Emma. The \"toys\" are initially incomprehensible to them, other than one which appears to be a [[Stuffed animal|stuffed]] [[rabbit]]. The children keep their discovery secret from their parents.\n\nEmma becomes telepathically connected to the rabbit, \"Mimzy\", which imparts knowledge onto her. The children gain [[genius]]-level [[intellect]]s and [[psionic]] powers: Noah can [[Teleportation|teleport]] objects using a card-sized rectangle of green lines of light and a conch shell to control spider, but thanks to her link, Emma develops the more advanced abilities, becoming the only one who can use the \"spinners\", stones which can float and produce a [[force field (technology)|force field]]. Emma describes herself as \"the chosen one\" but names Noah as \"the engineer\" without which she cannot \"build the bridge to the future\".\n\nThe children's parents, and Larry White, Noah's science schoolteacher discover the devices and the children's powers. By mistake, Noah causes a [[power outage|power black-out]] over half the state of Washington, alerting the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] to their activities. The family is held for questioning by Special Agent Nathaniel Broadman. The Mimzy is revealed as [[Synthetic life|artificial life]] utilizing [[nanotechnology]] created by [[Intel Corporation|Intel]].\n\nEmma relates a dire message from Mimzy: Many Mimzys were sent into the past, but none of the others had returned to their home time, because they lacked an \"engineer\" like Noah, and now Mimzy is beginning to disintegrate, and must convey uncorrupted human DNA to the future to correct the damage done to DNA by ecological catastrophes. The FBI do not believe them, so Noah and Emma use their powers to escape. Mimzy absorbs a [[Tears|tear]] from Emma, which contains her DNA. Via the time portal which Noah constructs using the toys, Mimzy returns to the future.\n\nLarry, who witnessed Mimzy leaving the present, says he saw \"numbers\", a reference to a previous dream he had which related to him the winning lottery numbers: He had missed out before by never buying a ticket. In the future, Mimzy provides the genetic information required to restore humanity, both physically and mentally, with Emma dubbed \"Our Mother\" by the people of the future.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Rhiannon Leigh Wryn]] as Emma Wilder\n* Chris O'Neil as Noah Wilder\n** Chris Sipe as Noah Wilder (other scenes)\n* [[Timothy Hutton]] as David Wilder\n* [[Joely Richardson]] as Jo Wilder\n* [[Rainn Wilson]] as Larry White,\n* [[Kathryn Hahn]] as Naomi Schwartz\n* [[Michael Clarke Duncan]] as FBI Special Agent Nathaniel Broadman.\n* [[Patrick Gilmore (actor)|Patrick Gilmore]] as FBI Task Force Agent.\n* [[Kirsten Williamson]] as Sheila Broadman\n* Marc Musso as Harry Jones\n* [[Megan McKinnon]] as Wendy\n* Irene Snow as Lena, the story's narrator.\n\n===Other characters===\nMackenzie Hamilton and [[Calum Worthy]] cameo as Teenage cyborgs. Well-known [[string theory|string theorist]] [[Brian Greene]] has a cameo appearance as an [[Intel]] scientist.\n\n==Development and production==\n''The Last Mimzy'' is loosely based upon \"[[Mimsy Were the Borogoves]]\" by [[Lewis Padgett]] (the pen name of collaborators [[Henry Kuttner]] and [[C. L. Moore]]); the story appeared in [[John W. Campbell]]'s magazine ''[[Astounding magazine|Astounding]]'' in 1943.<ref name=\"sfsite\">{{cite web | last = Norwood | first = Rick | title = Review: The Last Mimzy | publisher = SF Site | year = 2007 | url = http://www.sfsite.com/04b/lm246.htm | access-date = October 19, 2007}}</ref> The central idea of \"toys\" sent from the future to the present, and of the toys' alteration of the children's thought patterns remains, but with many differences. Originally, the transferral (from an unspecified date millions of years in the future) occurs by accident. The story makes the point that exposure to novel concepts would alter the children's perceptions \"naturally\" (irrespective of any intention on the part of the device's creator), since it would take place during an early phase of their intellectual development. Both the film's and short story's titles are derived from third line of the [[nonsense verse]] poem \"[[Jabberwocky]]\" in [[Lewis Carroll]]'s ''[[Through the Looking-Glass|Through the Looking-Glass, and What Alice Found There]]''. The adapted screenplay is by [[Bruce Joel Rubin]] and [[Toby Emmerich]].<ref>{{cite web | title = Movie Review: The Last Mimzy | publisher = Hollywood.com, Inc. | url = http://www.hollywood.com/review/The_Last_Mimzy/3671874 | access-date = September 7, 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080129181150/http://www.hollywood.com/review/The_Last_Mimzy/3671874|archive-date=January 29, 2008}}</ref>\n\nThe film's production team also included editor Alan Heim and sound designer [[Dane Davis]].
