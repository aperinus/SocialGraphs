The film, set in [[Dublin]], Ireland, contains many interconnected storylines, and is shot in a documentary-like style, with some sections presented as excerpts from television programs that exist within the show (one of the storylines follows a television documentary director).\n\nIt features several of Ireland's best-known actors, including [[Cillian Murphy]], [[Colm Meaney]] and [[Colin Farrell]], all of whom have featured in internationally successful films such as ''[[28 Days Later]]'' (Murphy), ''[[The Commitments (film)|The Commitments]]'' (Meaney) and ''[[Minority Report (film)|Minority Report]]'' (Farrell). It also featured the Scottish actress [[Kelly Macdonald]] who had appeared in ''[[Trainspotting (film)|Trainspotting]]''.\n\n== Plot ==\nThe film opens with Lehiff ([[Colin Farrell]]) charming a cashier. After flirting with the girl, punches her in the face and steals from the till. It quickly moves to John ([[Cillian Murphy]]) and Deirdre ([[Kelly Macdonald]]), a recently-separated young couple. The film will revolve around their extended friends.\n\nIt is quickly revealed that Lehiff is a petty criminal and always involved in trouble. Lehiff's nemesis, [[Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na|Garda]] Detective Jerry Lynch ([[Colm Meaney]]), presents himself as a saviour whose main mission is to fight the \"scumbags\" on Dublin's streets. He enlists the help of Ben Campion ([[Tom\u00e1s \u00d3 S\u00failleabh\u00e1in]]), an ambitious film-maker and the bane of his \"go-softer\" boss, who considers Lynch too nasty a subject to be shown on a mainstream \"docusoap\" series on Irish television.\n\nNext up is Mick ([[Br\u00edan F. O'Byrne]]), a Dublin bus driver. While on his route, Sally ([[Shirley Henderson]]) boards. Deeply insecure about her looks, she asks Mick about some hair on her lip, and he mocks her playfully. As the bus journey continues, Philip, a young boy, throws a rock at his bus, resulting in a bad crash, the aftermath of which Ben winds up shooting. Ben is told to focus his attention on Sally, Deirdre's sister, who helped the passengers after the crash. She grows bitter when Deirdre flaunts her new boyfriend, Sam ([[Michael McElhatton]]), a middle-aged bank manager who has left his wife of fourteen years, Noeleen, leaving her to question her own self-worth as a woman and wife.\n\nJohn is utterly lost without Deirdre and is determined to win her back. Mick, having become suspended from his job and low on funds, comes up with a scheme involving Lehiff and John. They kidnap Sam and hold Deirdre captive. They force Sam to go to his bank to get money for a ransom. Just as the plan seems to be working out, everything goes wrong, as Sam is assaulted by his enraged wife Noeleen on the street and the Garda\u00ed are forced to intervene. Mick and John flee without the money.\n\nLater, Mick loses his job after being wrongfully blamed for the crash; he becomes obsessed with taking revenge on the boy who caused it. After chasing Philip in his car, he loses control and is left balancing over the canal. Philip sits on the bonnet and jumps off, letting the car drop into the canal.\n\nDetective Lynch chases and corners Lehiff in an open field. He decides to take him on, while Ben films everything. Unfortunately, Lynch miscalculates; Lehiff gets the upper hand and threatens to kill him. Ben snatches at the gun and shoots Lehiff. Lynch covers it all up.\n\nAs the credits roll, Noeleen and Sam, now reunited, are in their house watching television. She is purposely sitting on the remote control and bullying him into changing the channels by hand.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Colin Farrell]] as Lehiff, a petty criminal with a penchant for getting into trouble with the law\n* [[Kelly Macdonald]] as Deirdre\n* [[Cillian Murphy]] as John, Deirdre's former boyfriend\n* [[Colm Meaney]] as Detective Jerry Lynch\n* [[Shirley Henderson]] as Sally\n* [[David Wilmot (actor)|David Wilmot]] as Oscar\n* [[Deirdre O'Kane]] as Noeleen\n* [[Michael McElhatton]] as Sam, a middle-aged bank manager\n* [[Tom\u00e1s \u00d3 S\u00failleabh\u00e1in]] as Ben Campion, an ambitious film-maker\n* [[Br\u00edan F.
