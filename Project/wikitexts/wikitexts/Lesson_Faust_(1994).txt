An [[co-production (media)|international co-production]] between the Czech Republic, France, the United Kingdom, the United States and Germany, the film merges live-action footage with [[stop-motion]] animation, including [[puppetry]] and [[claymation]].\n\nProduced by Jarom\u00edr Kallista, the film does not relate the legend of [[Faust]]us accurately according to the original, instead borrowing and blending elements from the 1808 [[Goethe's Faust|story as told]] by [[Goethe]] and c. 1598-1592 by [[Christopher Marlowe]] with traditional folk renditions. It has elements of modernism and absurdism, and has a Kafkaesque atmosphere, enhanced by being set in Prague, and the tone is dark but humorous. The film was selected as the Czech entry for the [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film|Best Foreign Language Film]] at the [[67th Academy Awards]], but was not accepted as a nominee.<ref>Margaret Herrick Library, Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nThe story begins on the streets of [[Prague]] on a grey morning busy with commuters. A colourless figure, played by [[Petr \u010cepek]], emerges from a metro station. On his way home, the man encounters two men handing out flyers. It is a map of the city with a location marked. He shrugs and discards it, returning to his lodging. As he opens the door, a black [[cockerel]] runs out. The man sits down to eat, cutting himself a slice of bread. He discovers an egg concealed inside the loaf. He cracks it open but it is empty. Suddenly the lights go out and the wind rises. Objects are thrown about the room. The commotion ceases; the man goes to the window and looks down to where the two men from earlier are staring up at him. One of them holds the cockerel. The man closes the blind and returns to the table, where he finds the map and, using his own map of the city, traces out the location marked.\n\nThe next day, he goes to the spot indicated and enters a dilapidated building just as a man rushes from it in fear. He continues into the interior and descends to a dressing room, where he finds a charred script, a robe embroidered with [[Seal (emblem)|sigils]], greasepaint, a wig with a beard and a cap. Sitting down, he addresses himself as \"[[Faust]]\" and speaks to himself (the first words spoken in the film) Faust's opening declaration of intent to follow black magic.\n\nAs the opening curtain is signalled, Faust finds himself on a stage, a performance about to begin. Ripping off his costume, he breaks through the stage backdrop into a vault where an alchemist's laboratory is revealed; with the aid of a book of spells, he brings to life a clay child which grows horrifyingly into his own image before he smashes it. Warned by a marionette angel not to experiment further but encouraged by a demon to do as he pleases, he is sent by a wooden messenger to a caf\u00e9 meeting with the two street-map men, identified as \"Cornelius\" and \"Valdes\", who give him a briefcase of magical devices. Returning to the vault, he uses these to summon Mephisto, offering Lucifer his soul in return for 24 years of self-indulgence.\n\nAt another caf\u00e9, Faust is entertained by Cornelius and Valdes, who provide a fountain of wine from a table-top. He watches as a tramp, carrying a severed human leg, is pestered by a large black dog until he throws the limb into the river. Faust finds a key in his food, uses it on a shop-front shutter, and is dragged back on stage by waiting stagehands. He mimes a scene from Gounod's opera, in which Mephisto returns and the pact with Lucifer is signed in blood. After the interval, Faust visits Portugal to demonstrate his supernatural powers to the King: when a requested restaging of the David and Goliath contest is poorly received, he drowns the entire Portuguese court.\n\nFaust is distracted from repentance by Helen of Troy, whom he seduces before realising she is a wooden demon in disguise. Lucifer arrives earlier than expected to claim his soul, and Faust rushes in panic from the theatre, meeting a newcomer in at the doorway as he bursts into the street. He is felled by a red car, and Cornelius and Valdes watch in amusement as a tramp carries away a severed leg from the scene of the accident. A policeman checks the car, but it is without a driver.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Petr \u010cepek]] \u2013 Faust\n* [[Jan Kraus (actor)|Jan Kraus]] \u2013 Cornelius\n* Vladim\u00edr Kudla \u2013 Waldes\n* Antonin Zacpal \u2013 Old man\n* [[Ji\u0159\u00ed Such\u00fd]] \u2013 Ka\u0161par\n* [[Andrew Sachs]] - All voices in the English dub\n\n== Reception ==\n''Faust'' received positive reviews from critics.
