The story presents a fictionalized account of the circumstances surrounding the death of actor [[George Reeves]] (played by [[Ben Affleck]]), the star of the 1950s film ''[[Superman and the Mole Men]]'' and television series ''[[Adventures of Superman (TV series)|Adventures of Superman]]''. [[Adrien Brody]] stars as a fictional character, Louis Simo, a private detective investigating [[Toni Mannix]] ([[Diane Lane]]), who was involved in a long romantic relationship with Reeves and was the wife of [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]] studio executive [[Eddie Mannix]] ([[Bob Hoskins]]). Reeves had ended the affair and had become engaged to a younger woman, aspiring actress Leonore Lemmon ([[Robin Tunney]]).\n\nDevelopment for ''Hollywoodland'' began in 2001 when [[Focus Features]] purchased Bernbaum's script, titled ''Truth, Justice, and the American Way''. [[Polish brothers|Michael and Mark Polish]] were set to direct with [[Benicio del Toro]] in the lead role, but Focus Features placed the film in turnaround to [[Miramax Films]] the following year. Ultimately, ''Truth, Justice, and the American Way'' became a joint production between the two studios and filming commenced in May 2005, with veteran television director Coulter making his feature film [[directorial debut]]. Due to copyright issues with [[DC Comics]], the film was retitled ''Hollywoodland'' and released to generally positive reviews.\n\n==Plot==\nIn June 1959, Louis Simo, a [[Los Angeles]] private investigator more interested in generating an income than in devotion to his clients, is spying on the wife of a man named Chester Sinclair to find if she is cheating. On a visit to his own ex-wife Laurie, Simo learns that his son is upset over the recent death of actor [[George Reeves]], who played [[Superman]] on television. Reeves was found dead inside his [[Beverly Hills]] home with a gunshot wound to the head, which the police ruled as a [[suicide]].\n\nSimo learns from a former police colleague that the Reeves suicide has aspects that the cops do not want to touch. Sensing the potential for making a name for himself, Simo begins investigating and notes several apparent conflicts with the official version of Reeves' death. He also bickers with Laurie over his failures as a father, particularly now when his son seems so troubled.\n\nYears before, in 1951, Reeves, whose acting career has stalled since appearing in ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with the Wind]]'', catches the eye of a beautiful woman and they end the night in each other's arms. In the morning, a newspaper photo reveals to Reeves that the woman is [[Toni Mannix]], the wife of [[Eddie Mannix]], a fixer and the general manager of [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]].\n\nFrightened that an affair with a studio boss's wife will destroy what is left of his career, Reeves is angry that Toni did not tell him. She claims to have an open relationship with Mannix and tells him not to worry. The much wealthier Toni begins to buy Reeves expensive gifts such as a house, a car and jewelry.\n\nReeves lands the starring role in the television series ''[[Adventures of Superman (TV series)|Adventures of Superman]]'', based on the [[Superman|comic book hero]]. The role makes Reeves famous and gives him a steady income, but he longs for more \"serious\" work and is uncomfortable with the public's stereotype of him as Superman, resulting in snickers from the audience when he is seen on screen in a sneak preview of the war film ''[[From Here to Eternity]]''. After film executives attending the preview heard the snickers, his formerly prominent role in the film was drastically reduced.\n\nAs the years pass, Reeves becomes bitter at being a kept man and at Toni for not using her clout to help out his career. He barbecues his Superman costume to \"celebrate\" the program's cancellation in 1958. He also meets a young woman in [[New York City]], actress Leonore Lemmon, and leaves Toni for her. Toni is brokenhearted and furious and seethes at her \"mistreatment\" by Reeves.\n\nSimo initially suspects that Leonore might have accidentally shot Reeves during an argument and imagines how the scenario might have played out. Simo is beaten at his home by thugs, apparently working for Mannix, who are trying to scare him off the case. This, and other evidence, leads Simo to suspect that Mannix was the one who had Reeves murdered. Simo has a vision of how that killing would have occurred.\n\nSinclair murders his wife, having grown impatient waiting for Simo's report. A guilt-plagued Simo gets drunk, then visits his son's school, where his inebriation scares the boy. Simo visits Reeves' manager, Arthur Weissman, who has a home movie that Reeves shot in order to promote some wrestling work. Reeves' sadness and disappointment with his life are evident in the footage. Simo's final imagined variation on Reeves' death concludes with the actor shooting himself. This is the most vivid of the three scenarios, and Simo imagines himself in the upstairs bedroom, watching the suicide.\n\nEach of the scenes imagined by Simo begins with Reeves playing a guitar and singing \"[[Green Eyes (Aquellos Ojos Verdes)]]\" in Spanish for his house guests. After each of the three imagined renditions, Reeves says good night to his guests, then retires to his bedroom upstairs, just before the gunshot.\n\nReeves' quest for success and Simo's realization of parallels to his own existence cause the detective to reevaluate his life. Simo watches another home movie, this one of himself and Laurie and their son in happier days. He goes to Laurie's house wearing a suit and tie, greeting his son hopefully.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Adrien Brody]] as Louis Simo\n* [[Diane Lane]] as [[Toni Mannix]]\n* [[Ben Affleck]] as [[George Reeves]]\n* [[Bob Hoskins]] as [[Eddie Mannix]]\n* [[Robin Tunney]] as Leonore Lemmon\n* [[Kathleen Robertson]] as Carol Van Ronkel\n* [[Lois Smith]] as Helen Bessolo\n* [[Larry Cedar]] as Chester Sinclair\n* [[Caroline Dhavernas]] as Kit Holliday\n* Kevin Hare as Robert Condon\n* [[Molly Parker]] as Laurie Simo\n* [[Zach Mills]] as Evan Simo\n* [[Neil Crone]] as Chuck\n* [[Seamus Dever]] as Phillip\n* [[Gareth Williams (actor)|Gareth Williams]] as Del\n* [[Dash Mihok]] as Sergeant Jack Paterson\n* Veronica Watt as [[Rita Hayworth]]\n* [[Todd Grinnell]] as Times Reporter\n* [[Joe Spano]] as [[Howard Strickling]]\n* [[Jeffrey DeMunn]] as Art Weissman\n}}\n\n==Production==\n[[Focus Features]] acquired a spec script written by Paul Bernbaum in December 2001 titled ''Truth, Justice, and the American Way''.

[[Time Warner]] is the parent company of both Warner Bros. and [[DC Comics]] and, as such, has the final say in the depiction of characters relating to their properties. The film's first title was ''Truth, Justice, and the American Way'', Superman's well-known patriotic [[catchphrase]], but Warner Bros. threatened legal action unless the film's title was changed so as not to associate the classic slogan with Reeves' death\u2014especially since Warner Bros. was banking the film ''[[Superman Returns]]'', which was released a few months earlier in June 2006. The filmmakers changed the title to ''Hollywoodland'', not as a reflection of the ailing [[Hollywood Sign]], but in reference to the general milieu of \"movieland\" itself. The filmmakers wished to use the familiar filmed opening of ''[[Adventures of Superman (TV series)|Adventures of Superman]]'' in context within ''Hollywoodland'', but Warner Bros. refused to license clips from the show itself. The movie recreated the show's opening and substituted a re-recorded version of the opening theme.<ref name=Ressner>{{cite news|author=Jeffrey Ressner|url=http://content.time.com/time/arts/article/0,8599,1533232,00.html|title=Who Owns Superman?|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|date=2006-09-08|access-date=2014-10-09}}</ref>\n\n==Historical liberties==\n''Hollywoodland'' takes liberties with actual historical events for dramatic purposes. Several events and places are condensed to fit into the film, including:\n\n* The film states that if the first season of ''Adventures of Superman'' was successful, they would film in color the second season. The series did not film in color until the third season.\n* During a personal appearance at a children's Western show, George Reeves meets a boy with a loaded gun, who almost shoots bullets at him. Reeves talks him into giving up the gun by saying that they would bounce off him, but hurt innocent bystanders. Although Reeves repeated this story himself, researchers have never been able to find anything to corroborate the story.<ref name=\"chasingthefrog.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.chasingthefrog.com/reelfaces/hollywoodland.php|title=Hollywoodland Movie True Story - Real George Reeves TV's Superman}}</ref><ref>Donald, Elizabeth. \"SuperGeek\", ''Belleville News-Democrat'', 6 June 2007</ref>\n* The depiction of Reeves' scenes in ''[[From Here to Eternity]]'' suffering audience derision at a test screening (and subsequent cutting of all of his scenes) is part of a mostly false  urban legend. No such test screening took place, and the finished film purportedly includes all of Reeves' scenes that were present in the original shooting script. However, Reeves name does not appear on the supporting cast credits page, giving rise to the implication his presence, if not his role, was somewhat diminished. Despite the premise the role of Maylon Stark was pared down, no alternate cuts of Reeves in the film have ever been proven to exist.<ref name=\"chasingthefrog.com\"/><ref>''Variety'', 17 August 2006</ref><ref>Cathy Schultz, PhD., ''History in The Movies''.
