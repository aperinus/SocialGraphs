Earl Brown]] appearing in supporting roles. The screenplay was adapted by [[Nick Hornby]] from [[Cheryl Strayed]]'s 2012 [[memoir]] ''[[Wild: From Lost to Found on the Pacific Crest Trail]]'', which is about a solo [[Backpacking (hiking)|backpacking]] trip Strayed undertook on the [[Pacific Crest Trail|trail]] in 1995 after numerous personal issues had left her life in shambles.\n\nThe film premiered at the [[Telluride Film Festival]] on August 29, 2014, and was released theatrically in North America on December 5, 2014. It received positive reviews and was a [[box office]] hit, grossing $52.5 million against its $15 million budget. Witherspoon and Dern received nominations at the [[87th Academy Awards]] for [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]] and [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]], respectively.<ref name=\"Wild\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/wild |title=Wild |website=Metacritic |publisher=CBS |access-date=January 21, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/2015/01/15/laura-dern-reese-witherspoon-wild-oscars/21801229/ |title=It'll be a 'Wild' night for Laura Dern |website=[[USA Today]] |access-date=January 23, 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nIn June 1995, despite a lack of hiking experience, [[Cheryl Strayed]] leaves [[Minneapolis]] to [[Backpacking (hiking)|hike]], by herself, {{convert|1100|mi}} of the {{convert|2650|mi|adj=on}} [[Pacific Crest Trail]]. During the journey, she [[Flashback (narrative)|reflects]] on her childhood and memories of her mother, Bobbi, whose death from cancer sent Cheryl into a deep depression that she tried to numb with [[heroin]] and [[anonymous sex]]. After her behavior destroyed her marriage and then led to an unwanted pregnancy, Cheryl had an [[abortion]] and resolved to hike the trail to try to rediscover the woman her mother raised her to be.\n\nCheryl begins her trek in the [[Mojave Desert]] in [[Southern California]]. On the first night, she discovers she brought the wrong type of fuel for her stove and is therefore unable to cook. After a few days of eating only cold food, she meets a farmer named Frank, who feeds her and takes her to get the correct fuel.\n\nFurther along the trail, Cheryl meets a hiker named Greg, who agrees to help her plan the next section of her hike when they get to [[Kennedy Meadows (CDP), California|Kennedy Meadows]]. While she is there, a camper named Ed helps her strategically lighten her overweight backpack and arrange to replace her undersized hiking boots with a new pair, which will be delivered somewhere further along the trail. At this and various other stops, Cheryl's best friend Aimee sends her provisions, and she also receives letters from her ex-husband Paul, who still cares about Cheryl, congratulating her on her progress.\n\nCheryl takes Greg's advice to avoid some upcoming deep snow in the [[Sierra Nevada]] by catching a bus to [[Reno]] and rejoining the PCT, deciding to extend her trip further into Oregon so she can walk the same distance as she had planned, but she still encounters quite a bit of snow. She is able to make it through and arrives at the town where her new boots were sent, though she has to walk the last 50 miles in sandals reinforced with duct tape after she accidentally knocks one of the small boots down a steep slope.\n\nAn empty water tank in the desert beyond the town leads Cheryl to go without water for a full day in extreme heat before, dehydrated and near exhaustion, she finds a muddy puddle from which she can get potable water using her [[Portable water purification|portable water purifier]]. While she waits for the water to disinfect, two hunters approach and make suggestive remarks, leaving Cheryl feeling threatened and vulnerable. One returns later in the day, but leaves when his friend calls for him, so Cheryl runs until she is sure she is not being followed.\n\nCheryl crosses into Oregon and goes to [[Ashland, Oregon|Ashland]]. She meets Jonathan, who invites her to a tribute concert to the recently-deceased [[Jerry Garcia]], and they spend the night together.\n\nSome time later, after visiting [[Crater Lake]], Cheryl gets to [[Mount Hood National Forest]], where she encounters a friendly group of young male hikers who recognize her from the brief quotes and poems that she frequently writes alongside her signature in the hiker's record books along the PCT.\n\nOne rainy day, Cheryl finds a [[llama]] that escaped from a young boy hiking with his grandmother. She returns it and chats with the boy, who asks about her parents. When she mentions her mother is dead, the boy sings her \"[[Red River Valley (song)|Red River Valley]]\", which his mother used to sing to him. The boy and his grandmother carry on down the trail, and Cheryl breaks down and cries.\n\nOn September 15, after 94 days of travel, Cheryl reaches the [[Bridge of the Gods (modern structure)|Bridge of the Gods]] on the [[Columbia River]] between Oregon and Washington, ending her journey. At various points along the trail, including at the bridge, she has encountered a red fox, which she interprets as being the spirit of her mother watching over her. As she walks onto the bridge, her future-self reflects, via [[voice-over]], on what she learned from her trip, and reveals that four years later she remarried at a spot near the bridge, nine years later she had a son, and ten years later she had a daughter, who she named Bobbi, after her mother.\n\n==Cast==\n<!-- first 9 (excluding young Cheryl) in the same order as the main credits, the rest in the same order as the scrolling credits -->\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Reese Witherspoon]] as [[Cheryl Strayed]]<ref name=\"Witherspoon\" />\n** Bobbi Strayed Lindstrom (daughter of the real-life Cheryl Strayed) as Cheryl (6 Yrs Old)<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://variety.com/2014/scene/vpage/wild-premiere-laura-dern-cheryl-strayed-reese-witherspoon-bruce-dern-1201361558/ |title='Wild' Premiere: Not Just For Women, 'It's a Film About Tough People' and Approved By Bruce Dern |last=Tepper |first=Allegra |date=November 20, 2014 |website=Variety.com |access-date=October 5, 2017}}</ref>\n* [[Laura Dern]] as Barbara \"Bobbi\" Grey, Cheryl's mother<ref name=\"THRFestivalReview\" />\n* [[Thomas Sadoski]] as Paul, Cheryl's ex-husband<ref name=\"THRFestivalReview\" /> (based on Marco Littig, the real-life Cheryl's ex-husband)\n* [[Michiel Huisman]]<ref name=\"ProductionStart\" /> as Jonathan, a man Cheryl has sex with after meeting him in [[Ashland, Oregon]]\n* [[Gaby Hoffmann]]<ref name=\"ProductionStart\" /> as Aimee, Cheryl's best friend in Minnesota\n* [[Kevin Rankin (actor)|Kevin Rankin]]<ref name=\"ProductionStart\" /> as Greg, a hiker Cheryl meets on the trail who ends up quitting (based on Roger Carpenter)\n* [[W.
