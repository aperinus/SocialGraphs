Filmed in [[Technicolor]], it features the songs of [[Irving Berlin]], including a new version of the title song, \"[[White Christmas (song)|White Christmas]]\", introduced by Crosby in the 1942 film ''[[Holiday Inn (film)|Holiday Inn]]''.<ref>{{citation |last=Curtiz |first=Michael |title=White Christmas |date=1954-10-14 |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0047673/ |access-date=2016-05-07}}</ref>\n\nProduced and distributed by [[Paramount Pictures]], the film is notable for being the first to be released in [[VistaVision]], a widescreen process developed by Paramount that entailed using twice the surface area of standard 35mm film; this large-area negative was also used to yield finer-grained standard-sized 35mm prints.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.widescreenmuseum.com/widescreen/vvstory.htm |title=The VistaVision Story |website=www.widescreenmuseum.com |access-date=2016-05-07}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nOn Christmas Eve in Europe in 1944, at the height of [[World War II]], former [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] star Captain Bob Wallace and aspiring performer Private Phil Davis entertain the 151st division with a [[soldier's show]]. The men have just received word their beloved Major General Thomas F. Waverly has been relieved of his command. Waverly arrives and delivers an emotional farewell. The men send him off with a rousing chorus of \"The Old Man\". After Waverly departs, enemy bombers attack the area and everyone takes cover. Phil pulls Bob away from a collapsing wall and is wounded by debris. Bob asks how he can pay back Phil for saving his life, and Phil suggests they become a duo act. Bob is not fond of the idea but feels obliged to agree.\n\nAfter the war, the two make it big, first as performers, then as producers, launching a hit musical, ''Playing Around''. They receive a letter supposedly from their old Mess Sergeant, Ben \"Freckle Face\" Haynes, asking them to view his sisters' act. They watch Betty and Judy sing at Novello's, a Florida nightclub. Phil, who likes to play matchmaker, notices Bob is interested in Betty. After the performance, the four meet, and Phil and Judy immediately hit it off. Betty and Bob, however, argue about Bob's cynicism, and the fact it was actually Judy who wrote the letter instead of Ben. [[Image:Bing Crosby and Danny Kaye in White Christmas trailer 3.jpg|left|thumb|275px|Bing Crosby as Bob Wallace and Danny Kaye as Phil Davis]]\n\nFinding out from Judy that the girls' landlord is falsely suing them for a damaged rug, and has even gone so far as to call the police to get his money, Phil gives them tickets he and Bob had purchased to spend Christmas in New York City. Bob and Phil improvise a performance to buy the girls time, then flee to the train, where they now have to sit up in the [[Bar car|Club Car]], much to Bob's chagrin.\n\nThe girls convince Phil and Bob to forgo New York and spend Christmas with them in Pine Tree, [[Vermont]], where they are booked as performers. Upon arriving in Vermont, they find all the tourists have left due to no snow and unseasonably warm weather. They arrive at the empty Columbia Inn and are aghast to discover that General Waverly is the landlord of the hotel, has sunk his life savings into it, and is on the verge of bankruptcy. Phil and Bob decide to invite some of the cast of ''Playing Around'' to Pine Tree to stage a show to draw in the guests and include Betty and Judy in the show. Betty and Bob's romance starts to bloom.\n\nLater, Bob discovers Waverly received a humiliating rejection letter to his request to rejoin the army. Bob determines to prove to the General he is not forgotten and calls up Ed Harrison, another old Army buddy who now has his own [[variety show]], for help. Ed suggests they put the general on the show and make a big scene of his misfortune and Bob's kindness, which would be free advertising for Bob and Phil. Bob strongly rejects the idea. Unfortunately, the housekeeper Emma eavesdrops on the other phone for the first half of the conversation. She relays Ed's idea to Betty, who becomes suddenly cold towards a baffled Bob.\n\nPhil and Judy stage a phony engagement, thinking Betty is trying to avoid romance because she does not want to leave Judy unprotected. However, this backfires when Betty accepts a gig in New York and leaves. Phil and Judy admit the truth to Bob, who becomes enraged and hurries to New York to tell Betty. They partially reconcile, but Bob meets up with Harrison before he has a chance to find out what really was bothering her. Betty sees Bob go on Harrison's show and invite the entire 151st division to secretly join him at Pine Tree to surprise General Waverly, at Bob and Phil's expense. Realizing she was mistaken, Betty returns to Vermont just in time to be in the show.\n\nOnce again on Christmas Eve, the soldiers surprise General Waverly with another rousing chorus of \"The Old Man\" when he arrives at the show, bringing him to tears. During the performance, Betty and Bob become engaged, and Judy and Phil decide to go through with their own engagement. As everyone sings \"White Christmas\", a thick snowfall at last blankets Vermont.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Bing Crosby and Danny Kaye in White Christmas trailer.jpg|right|thumb|267px|Bing Crosby as Bob Wallace and Danny Kaye as Phil Davis]]\n* [[Bing Crosby]] as Bob Wallace\n* [[Danny Kaye]] as Phil Davis\n* [[Rosemary Clooney]] as Betty Haynes\n* [[Vera-Ellen]] as Judy Haynes\n* [[Dean Jagger]] as Major General Tom Waverly\n* [[Mary Wickes]] as Emma Allen\n* [[Johnny Grant (radio personality)|Johnny Grant]] as Ed Harrison\n* [[John Brascia]] as John/Johnny, Judy Haynes' dance partner \n* [[Anne Whitfield]] as Susan Waverly\n* [[Percy Helton]] as Train conductor\n* [[I.

The centerpiece of the film is the [[White Christmas (song)|title song]], first used in ''[[Holiday Inn (film)|Holiday Inn]]'', which won that film an [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] for Best Original Song in 1942. In addition, \"[[Count Your Blessings (Irving Berlin song)|Count Your Blessings]]\" earned the picture its own Oscar nomination in the same category.\n\nThe song \"Snow\" was originally written for ''[[Call Me Madam]]'' with the title \"Free\", but was dropped in out-of-town tryouts. The melody and some of the words were kept, but the lyrics were changed to be more appropriate for a Christmas movie. For example, one of the lines of the original song is:\n\n{{poemquote|Free \u2013 the only thing worth fighting for is to be free.\nFree \u2013 a different world you'd see if it were left to me.}}\n\nA composer's demo of the original song can be found on the CD ''Irving Sings Berlin''.\n\n[[File:Rosemary Clooney and Bing Crosby in White Christmas trailer.jpg|thumb|267px|Rosemary Clooney as Betty Haynes\nand Bing Crosby as Bob Wallace]]The song \"What Can You Do with a General?\" was originally written for an un-produced project called ''Stars on My Shoulders''.\n\nTrudy Stevens provided the singing voice for Vera-Ellen, including in \"Sisters\". (The first edition of Vera-Ellen's biography by David Soren made the mistake of suggesting that \"perhaps\" Clooney sang for Vera in \"Sisters\". The second edition of the biography corrected that error by adding this: \"Appropriately, they sing \"Sisters\" with Rosemary Clooney actually dueting with Trudy Stabile (wife of popular bandleader Dick Stabile), who sang under the stage name Trudy Stevens and who had been personally recommended for the dubbing part by Clooney. Originally, Gloria Wood was going to do Vera-Ellen's singing until Clooney intervened on behalf of her friend.\"<ref>{{cite book |last=Soren |first=David |title=Vera-Ellen: The Magic and the Mystery |year=2003 |url=https://www.google.com/books/edition/Vera_Ellen/aA4TAAAACAAJ |page=145 |isbn=9781887664486}}</ref>) It was not possible to issue an \"original soundtrack album\" of the film, because [[Decca Records]] controlled the soundtrack rights, but Clooney was under exclusive contract with [[Columbia Records]]. Consequently, each company issued a separate \"soundtrack recording\": Decca issuing ''[[Selections from Irving Berlin's White Christmas]]'', while Columbia issued ''[[Irving Berlin's White Christmas]]''. On the former, the song \"Sisters\" (as well as all of Clooney's vocal parts) was recorded by [[Peggy Lee]], while on the latter, the song was sung by Clooney and her own sister, [[Betty Clooney|Betty]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Discogs |url=http://www.discogs.com/Rosemary-Clooney-In-Songs-From-The-Paramount-Pictures-Production-Of-Irving-Berlins-White-Christmas/release/3615447 |website=Discogs.com |access-date=January 26, 2016}}</ref>\n\nBerlin wrote \"A Singer, A Dancer\" for Crosby and his planned co-star [[Fred Astaire]]; when Astaire became unavailable, Berlin re-wrote it as \"A Crooner \u2013 A Comic\" for Crosby and [[Donald O'Connor]], but when O'Connor left the project, so did the song. Another song written by Berlin for the film was \"Sittin' in the Sun (Countin' My Money)\" but because of delays in production Berlin decided to publish it independently.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Reynolds |first1=Fred |title=Road to Hollywood |publisher=John Joyce |location=Gateshead, UK |date=1986 |page=231}}</ref> Crosby and Kaye also recorded another Berlin song (\"Santa Claus\") for the opening WWII Christmas Eve show scene, but it was not used in the final film.

Crosby and Astaire had previously co-starred in ''[[Holiday Inn (film)|Holiday Inn]]'' (1942) \u2013 where the song \"White Christmas\" first appeared \u2013 and ''[[Blue Skies (1946 film)|Blue Skies]]'' (1946).

Dancer [[Barrie Chase]] appears unbilled, as the character Doris Lenz (\"Mutual, I'm sure!\"). Future Oscar winner [[George Chakiris]] also appears<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/person/31640%7c58364/George-Chakiris/biography.html |title=Biography for George Chakiris |work=Turner Classic Movies}}</ref> as one of the stone-faced black-clad dancers surrounding Rosemary Clooney in \"Love, You Didn't Do Right by Me\". [[John Brascia]] leads the dance troupe and appears opposite Vera-Ellen throughout much of the movie, particularly in the \"Mandy\" and \"Choreography\" numbers. The photo Vera-Ellen shows of her brother Benny (the one Phil refers to as \"Freckle-faced Haynes, the dog-faced boy\") is actually a photo of [[Carl Switzer]], who played Alfalfa in the ''[[Our Gang]]'' film series, in an army field jacket and helmet liner.\n\nA scene from the film featuring Crosby and Kaye was broadcast the year after the film's release, on [[Christmas Day]] 1955, in the final episode of the [[NBC]] TV show ''[[Colgate Comedy Hour]]'' (1950\u20131955).\n\n==Production==\nBerlin suggested a movie based on his song in 1948. Paramount put up the $2 million budget and only took 30% of the proceeds.<ref name=\"new\"/>\n\nMel Frank and Norman Panama were hired to add material for [[Danny Kaye]]. They felt the whole script needed rewriting, and Curtiz agreed. \"It was a torturous eight weeks of rewriting\", said Panama. Frank said \"writing that movie was the worst experience of my life. Norman Krasna was a talented man but... it was the lousiest story I'd ever heard. It needed a brand new story, one that made sense.\" They did the job at $5,000 a week.<ref>HOLIDAY FILMS A GHOST OF CHRISTMAS PASTWilson, John M.
