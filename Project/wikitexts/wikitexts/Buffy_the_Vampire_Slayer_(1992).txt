Five years later, he created the darker, and critically acclaimed, television series [[Buffy the Vampire Slayer|of the same name]].\n\n==Plot==\nHigh school senior [[Buffy Summers]] ([[Kristy Swanson]]) attends Hemery High School in [[Los Angeles]]; her main concerns are shopping and spending time with her rich, snooty friends and her boyfriend, Jeffrey Kramer ([[Randall Batinkoff]]). While at school one day, she is approached by a man who calls himself [[Merrick (Buffyverse)|Merrick]] ([[Donald Sutherland]]). He informs her that she is [[Slayer (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|The Slayer]], or Chosen One, destined to [[Vampire hunter|kill]] [[vampire]]s, and he is a [[Watcher (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Watcher]] whose duty it is to guide and train her. She initially rejects his claim but changes her mind when he vividly describes a recurring dream of hers. Additionally, Buffy is exhibiting uncanny abilities not known to her, including heightened agility, senses, and endurance, yet she repeatedly tries Merrick's patience with her frivolous nature, indifference to slaying, and sharp-tongued remarks.\n\nAfter several successful outings, Buffy is drawn into conflict with Lothos ([[Rutger Hauer]]), a local vampire king and his acolyte, Amilyn ([[Paul Reubens]]). Two young men, [[List of minor Buffy the Vampire Slayer characters#Pike|Oliver Pike]] ([[Luke Perry]]) and Benny Jacks ([[David Arquette]]), who resented Buffy and her friends due to differing social circles, are out drinking when they're attacked by Amilyn. Benny is turned, but Pike is saved by Merrick. As a vampire, Benny visits Pike and tries to get him to join him. Later, when Pike and his boss are discussing Benny, Pike tells him to run if he sees him.\n\nAmilyn also abducts Cassandra ([[Natasha Gregson Wagner]]), a studious girl from Buffy's class, to sacrifice to Lothos. When her body is found, the news spreads through Los Angeles and Hemery High, but her murder is met with indifference from Buffy's clique.\n\nWhen Pike realizes there's something wrong with Benny and that he's no longer safe, he decides to leave town. His plan is thwarted, however, when he encounters Amilyn and his gang of vampires. Amilyn hitches a ride on the hood of his van, which crashes into a tree just before Amilyn loses an arm. Buffy and Merrick arrive to rescue him and Amilyn leaves the fight to talk to Lothos. After this encounter, Buffy and Pike start a friendship that eventually becomes romantic, and Pike becomes Buffy's partner in fighting the undead.\n\nDuring a basketball game, Buffy discovers that Grueller, one of the players and a friend of Jeffrey's, is a vampire. After a quick chase to a parade float storage yard, Buffy confronts Lothos, shortly after she and Pike take down his gang. Lothos puts Buffy into a trance, but Merrick intervenes, breaking the trance. Lothos stabs Merrick with the stake he attempted to use on him and then leaves, saying Buffy is not ready. As Merrick dies, he tells Buffy to do things her own way rather than live by the rules of others and gives her one final clue: \"Remember about the music.\"\n\nBecause of her new life, its responsibilities, and the heartbreak of losing her Watcher, Buffy, emotionally shocked, starts neglecting her Slayer duties. When she arrives at school, she attempts to explain things to her friends, but they refuse to understand her, as they are more concerned with an upcoming school dance. Buffy abandons them as she realizes she has outgrown their immature, selfish behavior.\n\nAt the senior dance, Buffy is dismayed to find Jeffrey has dumped her for one of her friends. She meets up with Pike, reciprocate their feelings as they dance and kiss. However, Lothos sends his army of vampire minions to the school to attack the classmates at the dance.\n\nBuffy confronts the vampires outside, while inside the gym Pike fights and kills the vampiric Benny and everybody is able to fight back under his lead. After overpowering the vampire army, Buffy confronts Lothos inside the school and kills Amilyn with Lothos\u2019s permission. Amilyn takes a comically long time to die. Lothos attempts to ensorcel Buffy again, but when the dance music stops, she remembers Merrick's words and defends herself.\n\nShe first tries to repel Lothos with a cross, but the vampire king is unimpressed. He grabs the cross, setting it afire, but Buffy uses her hair spray as a makeshift flamethrower and burns him before escaping to the gym. Buffy sees her classmates recovering from the vampire attack, but Lothos bursts into the gym, promising to kill the students. The Slayer and vampire duel, a wooden flag staff versus a [[katana]]. Eventually, Buffy stakes Lothos and kills him.\n\nAs the survivors leave, Buffy and Pike decide to finish their dance. The film ends with the couple leaving the dance on a motorcycle. A skeptical news crew headed up by [[Liz Smith (journalist)|Liz Smith]] interviews the students and the principal about the vampire attack during the credits. A mid-credits scene shows Amilyn still in the process of dying.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Kristy Swanson]] as [[Buffy Summers]]\n* [[Luke Perry]] as [[Pike (Buffyverse character)|Oliver Pike]]\n* [[Rutger Hauer]] as Lothos\n* [[Donald Sutherland]] as [[Merrick (Buffyverse)|Merrick Jamison-Smythe]]\n* [[Paul Reubens]] as Amilyn\n* [[Hilary Swank]] as Kimberly Hannah\n* Paris Vaughan as Nicole \"Nicki\"\n* Michele Abrams as Jennifer\n* [[Randall Batinkoff]] as Jeffrey Kramer\n* [[David Arquette]] as Benny Jacks\n* [[Stephen Root]] as Principal Gary Murray\n* [[Natasha Gregson Wagner]] as Cassandra\n* [[Sasha Jenson]] as Grueller\n* [[Thomas Jane|Tom Jane]] as Zeph\n* [[Candy Clark]] as [[Joyce Summers|Buffy's Mom]]<!-- this character is not credited as Joyce Summers, who was created for the TV series -->\n* [[Ben Affleck]] (''uncredited'') as Basketball Player #10\n* [[Ricki Lake]] (''uncredited'') as Charlotte\n* [[Seth Green]] (''uncredited'') as a vampire\n* [[Alexis Arquette]] (''uncredited'') as vampire DJ\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\nWriter Whedon sold the film to country singer [[Dolly Parton]]'s production company, Sandollar, in the fall of 1991.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.yahoo.com/movies/joss-whedon-buffy-the-vampire-slayer-118217991342.html |title=Remembering Buffy the Vampire Slayer film |publisher=Yahoo movies |date=May 5, 2015 |access-date=June 25, 2016}}</ref> Production was limited to five weeks to accommodate [[Luke Perry]]'s ''[[Beverly Hills, 90210]]'' filming schedule.<ref name=\"Robin Burks\">{{cite news| url=https://screenrant.com/buffy-movie-shocking-trivia-facts/| title=Things You Didn't Know About the Buffy the Vampire Slayer Movie| author=Robin Burks| publisher=screenrant.com| date=2017-12-22| access-date=2018-02-18}}</ref>\n\nWhedon was involved in an advisory role early in the production but departed after becoming dissatisfied with the direction the film was taking.<ref name=\"Robin Burks\"/> Executives at [[20th Century Fox]] removed many of Whedon's jokes, believing the humor to be too abstract for audiences.

It was released on [[DVD]] in the U.S. in 2001 and on [[Blu-ray]] in 2011.\n\n==Spin offs==\n===Television===\n{{main|Buffy the Vampire Slayer}}\nThe film was taken in a different direction from what one of its writers [[Joss Whedon]] intended, and five years later, he created the darker and acclaimed TV series [[Buffy the Vampire Slayer|of the same name]].\n\nMany of the details given in the film differ from [[Buffyverse canon|those of the later television series]]. For example, Buffy's age and history are dissimilar; she is a senior in high school in the film, but the series starts with her as a sophomore. The film does portray who the Buffy of the TV series was before she learned of her destiny as the Slayer: a popular but selfish and superficial cheerleader. In the film, her parents are wealthy but negligent socialites who care little for her and spend their time at parties and golf tournaments; in the TV series, Buffy has a caring, newly divorced mother named [[Joyce Summers|Joyce]]. The supernatural abilities of both vampires and the Slayer are depicted differently. The vampires in the film die like humans; in the TV series, they turn to dust. Unlike the TV series, their faces remain human albeit pale, fanged, and with notched ears, whereas in the TV series, they take on a demonic aspect, especially when newly raised. The TV series suggests that new vampires must consciously learn to maintain a human appearance. In the film, Merrick is hundreds of years old, having lived many lives training many Slayers; in the TV series, Watchers are mortal and specially trained for their role and mission. Merrick's British accent and the manner of his death are different when he appears in flashbacks in the TV series.\n\nJoss Whedon has expressed his disapproval with the film's interpretation of the script,<ref>[http://www.cise.ufl.edu/cgi-bin/cgiwrap/hsiao/buffy/get-archive?date=19990117 Bronze VIP Archive - January 17, 1999<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141220181357/http://www.cise.ufl.edu/cgi-bin/cgiwrap/hsiao/buffy/get-archive?date=19990117 |date=December 20, 2014 }}</ref> stating, \"I finally sat down and had written it and somebody had made it into a movie, and I felt like&nbsp;\u2014 well, that's not quite her. It's a start, but it's not quite the girl.\"\n\nAccording to the ''Official Buffy Watcher's Guide'', Whedon wrote the pilot to the TV series as a sequel to his original script, which is why the TV series makes references to events that did not occur in the film. In 1999, [[Dark Horse Comics]] released a graphic novel adaptation of Whedon's original script under the title ''[[The Origin (Buffy comic)|The Origin]]''. Whedon stated: \"The ''Origin'' comic, though I have issues with it, CAN pretty much be accepted as canonical. They did a cool job of combining the movie script with the series, that was nice, and using the series Merrick and not a certain OTHER thespian who shall remain hated.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cise.ufl.edu/cgi-bin/cgiwrap/hsiao/buffy/get-archive?date=19990117 |title=Bronze VIP Archive - January 17, 1999 |publisher=Cise.ufl.edu |date=1999-01-17 |access-date=2010-08-23 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141220181357/http://www.cise.ufl.edu/cgi-bin/cgiwrap/hsiao/buffy/get-archive?date=19990117 |archive-date=December 20, 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Soundtrack==\n{{Infobox album\n| name       = Buffy the Vampire Slayer (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack)\n| type       = soundtrack\n| artist     = Various\n| cover      =\n| alt        =\n| released   = July 28, 1992\n| recorded   = December 1991-April 1992\n| venue      =\n| studio     =\n| genre      =\n| length     = 41:57\n| label      = [[Columbia Records|Columbia]]\n| producer   =\n| prev_title =\n| prev_year  =\n| next_title =\n| next_year  =\n}} \n{{Track listing\n| collapsed       = \n| headline        = Buffy the Vampire Slayer (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack)\n| extra_column    = Original artist(s)\n\n| all_writing     = \n| all_lyrics      = \n| all_music       =\n\n| title1          = [[Keep It Comin' (Dance Till You Can't Dance No More)]]\n| extra1          = [[C+C Music Factory]] featuring [[Deborah Cooper]] and [[Q-Unique]]\n| length1         = 3:58\n\n| title2          = Man Smart, Woman Smarter\n| extra2          = [[Dream Warriors (band)|Dream Warriors]]\n| length2         = 4:31\n\n| title3          = Silent City\n| extra3          = [[Matthew Sweet]]\n| length3         = 2:51\n\n| title4          = We Close Our Eyes \n| extra4          = [[Susanna Hoffs]] \n| note4          = originally by [[Oingo Boingo]]\n| length4         = 3:54\n\n| title5          = Little Heaven\n| extra5          = [[Toad the Wet Sprocket]]\n| length5         = 4:27\n\n| title6          = [[I Ain't Gonna Eat Out My Heart Anymore]]\n| extra6          = [[Divinyls|diVINYLS]]\n| length6         = 4:32\n\n| title7          = [[Party with the Animals]]\n| extra7          = [[Ozzy Osbourne]] \n| length7         = 4:18\n\n| title8          = Zap City\n| extra8          = [[The Cult]]\n| length8         = 5:14\n\n| title9          = [[I Fought the Law]]\n| extra9          = [[Mary's Danish]] \n| note9           = originally by [[The Crickets]]\n| length9         = 3:19\n\n| title10         =  Light Comes Out of Black\n| extra10         = [[Pantera]] and [[Rob Halford]]\n| length10        = 4:59\n}}\n\nThe soundtrack does not include every song played in the film, which also included \"[[Everybody Hurts]]\" by [[R.E.M.]], \"[[War Babies (War Babies album)|In the Wind]]\" by [[War Babies (band)|War Babies]], and \"Inner Mind\" by [[Eon (musician)|Eon]].\n\n==Possible remake==\nOn May 25, 2009, ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' reported that [[Roy Lee]] and Doug Davison of [[Vertigo Entertainment]] were working with Fran Rubel Kuzui and Kaz Kuzui on a re-envisioning or relaunch of the ''Buffy'' film for the big screen.

Not only the fandom, but the main cast members of both the ''Buffy'' and ''[[Angel (1999 TV series)|Angel]]'' series expressed disagreement with the report on Twitter and in recent interviews. [[Sarah Michelle Gellar]] said, \"I think it's a horrible idea.
