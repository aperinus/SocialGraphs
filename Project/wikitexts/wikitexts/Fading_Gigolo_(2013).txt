Murray, whose used bookstore has failed as a business, convinces his friend and former employee Fioravante ([[John Turturro]]) to take the gig, as both are short of money. Soon, they build a thriving [[gigolo]] trade with Murray as the pimp. Murray lives with Othella ([[Tonya Pinkins]]) and her children, one of whom gets head lice. Murray takes the boy to Avigal ([[Vanessa Paradis]]), the attractive widow of a [[Hasidic Judaism|Hassidic]] rabbi, for treatment.\n\nMurray tells Avigal about Fioravante, claiming he's a massage healer who can help her, before taking her to see him. Being too [[Orthodox Jewish feminism|religiously observant]] to even [[Negiah#Shaking hands in halacha|shake hands]] with him, she nonetheless allows Fioravante to massage her back. That touch, the first in two years since the passing of her husband, brings her to tears. Meanwhile, Dovi ([[Liev Schreiber]]), who works for [[Shomrim (neighborhood watch group)|Shomrim]], a [[Williamsburg, Brooklyn]] neighborhood patrol, becomes suspicious and follows Murray. Dovi is in love with Avigal, but she does not encourage him. Fioravante and Avigal meet several more times, culminating in a kiss in the park.\n\nFioravante is summoned to the long planned ''m\u00e9nage'', but he's unable to finish it. The two women cheerfully realize the truth\u2014he has fallen in love. Murray is kidnapped by a group of Hassids, taken to a [[Beth din|Rabbinic Court]] and interrogated. Avigal interrupts the court and confesses to violating the [[Negiah|laws of modesty]], but nothing more, explaining she was lonely. Avigal now accepts Dovi, but has him drive her to Fioravante to say goodbye. Fioravante tells Murray he is leaving, though he reconsiders after a caf\u00e9 encounter with another beautiful woman.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[John Turturro]] as Fioravante\n* [[Woody Allen]] as Murray Schwartz\n* [[Sharon Stone]] as Dr. Parker\n* [[Sof\u00eda Vergara]] as Selima\n* [[Vanessa Paradis]] as Avigal\n* [[Liev Schreiber]] as Dovi\n* [[Eugenia Kuzmina]] as Olga\n* [[Tonya Pinkins]] as Othella\n* [[Max Casella]] as Guy at counter\n* [[Aida Turturro]] as Driver's wife\n* [[Bob Balaban]] as Sol\n* [[Michael Badalucco]] as Burly driver\n* [[David Margulies]] as Chief Rebbe\n* [[Aur\u00e9lie Claudel]] as Tai Chi woman\n* [[Loan Chabanol]] as Loan\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Release==\n''Fading Gigolo'' screened in the Special Presentation section at the [[2013 Toronto International Film Festival]] on September 8, 2013.<ref name=variety/> It received a limited release in the United States on April 18, 2014.<ref>{{cite news|last=McDaniel|first=Matt|title=Sharon Stone Cozies Up With Sofia Vergara in 'Fading Gigolo' Trailer Premiere|url=https://movies.yahoo.com/blogs/movie-news/sharon-stone-opens-sofia-vergara-fading-gigolo-trailer-234223654.html|accessdate=February 11, 2014|website=[[Yahoo!
