The film was a critical and commercial failure.\n\n==Plot==\nRicky Hayman and Kate Newell work at the Good Buy Shopping Network, a [[home shopping]] channel run by John McBainbridge. Sales have been down over the last two years under Ricky's management, and Kate was brought in to come up with new ideas.\n\nRicky views Kate as a threat and she expresses her dislike for him as well. However, John has given Ricky an ultimatum to increase sales, or lose his job. While out driving one day, Ricky and Kate come across a [[charisma]]tic strange man who calls himself \"G\". G is unusual in that he wears white robes and is perpetually happy and smiling. He seems to sense how troubled Ricky is, and follows them back to the Good Buy studio.\n\nG wanders onto the set of an [[infomercial]], and while he is on the air, the number of calls with customers wanting to buy something increases. Kate notices this and gets G his own spot on the network selling items. Meanwhile, the mutual dislike between Ricky and Kate fades and they begin to express romantic interest in each other.\n\nG's infomercials are mostly spontaneous anecdotes or thoughts about life, but customers connect with him and even the slowest moving items begin selling out. While staying at Ricky's house, he encounters a party of businessmen and displays his talents by making a [[Rolex]] watch \"disappear\" and curing a man of his fear of flying. Ricky begins marketing G's name on other items to increase sales. He wants to give G his own show, but the stressful work environment and throngs of fans who want to meet G begin to take its toll.\n\nG is no longer the happy, inspiring man he once was, and when Kate tries to convince John to let G leave the network, he refuses and she quits out of contempt. Ricky reaps the benefits of the increased sales, receiving a large promotion and a new office. However, the rewards seem hollow due to G's lethargy and Kate's rejection of him.\n\nOn the night of the premiere of G's new show, Ricky searches himself and decides that letting G go is the right choice. He announces his decision live on air to the studio audience and to his boss. Kate hears of his decision and forgives Ricky, racing back to the studio to be with him. They have a romantic reunion on the air, and the show is ended. Afterwards, Ricky and Kate say their goodbyes to the fully recovered G, who wanders off into the distance to continue his pilgrimage.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Eddie Murphy]] as G\n* [[Jeff Goldblum]] as Ricky Hayman\n* [[Kelly Preston]] as Kate Newell\n* [[Robert Loggia]] as John McBainbridge\n* [[Jon Cryer]] as Barry\n* [[Eric McCormack]] as Scott Hawkes\n* [[Jennifer Taylor (actress)|Jennifer Bini Taylor]] as Hot Tub Girl\n* [[Adriana Cata\u00f1o]] as Television hostess\n* [[Eugene Levy]] as Guy on background television (uncredited)\n\n[[Morgan Fairchild]], [[Betty White]], [[Florence Henderson]], [[James Brown]], [[Soupy Sales]], [[Dan Marino]], [[Willard Scott]], Nick Santa Maria and [[Nino Cerruti]] appear as themselves.\n\n==Production==\nAccording to [[Splitsider]], [[John Candy]] was signed on for the role played by Murphy back in 1993, a year before the former's death.<ref name=split>{{cite web|last=Evans|first=Bradford|title=The Lost Roles of John Candy|date=2 June 2011|publisher=[[Splitsider]]|url=http://splitsider.com/2011/06/the-lost-roles-of-john-candy/|access-date=26 July 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180520084658/http://splitsider.com/2011/06/the-lost-roles-of-john-candy/|archive-date=May 20, 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref> Murphy turned down the lead role that eventually went to [[Chris Tucker]] in ''[[Rush Hour (1998 film)|Rush Hour]]'' to star in this film instead.\n\n==Reception==\n===Box office===\n''Holy Man'' was a [[Box office bomb|major box office failure]], as it grossed $12,069,719 in North America, compared to its budget of over $60 million.<ref name=mojo>{{cite web |title = Holy Man (1998) |url = http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=holyman.htm |work = [[Box Office Mojo]] |access-date = May 23, 2010 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title= 'Holy Man' Needs Miracle|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|url= http://articles.latimes.com/1998/oct/13/entertainment/ca-31897|access-date=2021-07-08|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181013011438/http://articles.latimes.com/1998/oct/13/entertainment/ca-31897|archive-date=2018-10-13}}</ref> The film was released in the [[United Kingdom]] on February 19, 1999, and only opened on #8.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.25thframe.co.uk/charts/chart.php?chart=19990219|title=Weekend box office 19th February 1999 - 21st February 1999|publisher=www.25thframe.co.uk|access-date=18 November 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Critical response===\n''Holy Man'' received largely negative reviews, with criticism aimed at the script and acting.
