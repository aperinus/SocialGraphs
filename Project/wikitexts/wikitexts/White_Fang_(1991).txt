Based on [[Jack London]]'s 1906 novel ''[[White Fang]]'', it tells the story of the friendship between a young [[Klondike, Yukon|Klondike]] gold prospector and a [[wolfdog]]. White Fang is portrayed by a [[wolfdog]], [[Jed (wolfdog)|Jed]], who also appeared in such films as ''[[The Thing (1982 film)|The Thing]]'' (1982) and ''[[The Journey of Natty Gann]]'' (1985).<ref name=\"imdb\" /> The film was released on January 18, 1991, by [[Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures|Buena Vista Pictures]]. A sequel to the film, ''[[White Fang 2: Myth of the White Wolf]]'', was released in 1994.\n\n==Plot==\n{{Cleanup rewrite|date=July 2022}}\n{{long plot|date=July 2022}}\nIn 1896, during the [[Klondike Gold Rush]], a young explorer named Jack Conroy arrives in [[Alaska]] from [[San Francisco]] to look for his deceased father's mining claim. Conroy meets two mushers named Clarence \"Skunker\" Thurston and Alex Larson, Conroy's father's buddy, who reluctantly agree to guide Jack to his father's claim in [[Yukon]]. While on their journey, they are stalked by a large pack of [[wolves]]. One night, while resting at a campfire, a female wolf named Kiche manages to lure one of the [[sled dog]]s (Digger) away from the group, and another wolf appears and chases the dog into the woods. Skunker uses his ammunition to wound Kiche and gives chase to save his dog, but is killed and devoured by the rest of the pack. Later that night, the wolves return but are scared off by Jack and Alex using burning branches. The following morning the wolves attack the two men, but they are saved when another sled team arrives with one of the men mortally shooting a female wolf. The injured wolf hobbles back to her den, and her cub remains by her side until she dies. The pup is left to fend for himself. Jack and Alex reach a town where they plan to stay for the winter. A band of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]], meanwhile, find the pup, and the chief, realizing he is a [[wolfdog]] (a hybrid of a wolf and dog) from the color of his teeth, names him White Fang.\n\nAs spring comes, Jack and Alex resume their quest, but stop off at the Native Americans' settlement. The chief explains that White Fang has been raised to obey, not to be friendly, but Jack seeks to change that. Jack's chance comes when he is suddenly attacked by a vicious [[grizzly bear]], who chases him until he takes cover under a woodpile. White Fang, seeing Jack in danger, intervenes and holds the bear at bay rather than fighting it while standing his ground against the animal until it eventually gives up and leaves, saving Jack's life in the process. Jack and Alex later leave the settlement. Not long after, White Fang is unfairly traded to a brutal dogfighter named Beauty Smith (who previously stole Jack's money); he blackmails the Native American for the wolfdog, saying that ownership of a wild animal is considered illegal. Smith and his gang train and abuse White Fang into becoming a vicious killing machine in order to enter him into illegal dogfights. White Fang eventually meets his match in a brutal fight against a [[bulldog]], but Jack happens upon the fight and intervenes in the nick of time. Having earlier reached his father's claim and begun the work of digging for gold, Jack returns with White Fang to the cabin where he seeks to transform White Fang's vicious and territorial nature.\n\nJack's attempts to tame White Fang eventually succeed; both animal and man develop a close and trusting bond. Alex helps Jack mine for gold and they strike it rich with the help of White Fang. One morning, Jack travels to town to claim proper ownership to the gold when Luke notices White Fang with him. Seeking retaliation and planning to steal the gold for himself, Smith and his men attack the cabin site armed with guns and explosives. White Fang attacks Tinker, who accidentally discharges his gun, wounding Luke in the process. White Fang eventually subdues Smith until he's ordered by Jack to back down. Jack and Alex take Smith and his men prisoner and force them at gunpoint to haul gold ore into town.\n\nAlex and his wife, Belinda, offer to take Jack back to [[San Francisco]], but he lets Jack know that city life is no place for a wolf; he must let White Fang run free in the wild. Though White Fang cannot understand why Jack is trying to leave him, Jack's efforts by using a stick (which is White Fang's worst fear when he was under Smith) finally succeed in scaring the wolfdog off. Later, just as he's boarding the ship back to [[San Francisco]], Jack realizes that his rightful place is in the Yukon and he decides to stay behind alone and live off the land; Alex congratulates him by saying that it is what Jack's father would have wanted. After a short time, White Fang returns to the cabin site where he and Jack are happily reunited.<ref name=\"mg\" />\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Ethan Hawke]] as Jack Conroy, a young man trying to fulfill his father's dying wish to find gold in the treacherous Yukon Valley\n* [[Jed (wolfdog)|Jed]] as White Fang, a [[grey wolf]]-[[Siberian husky]] hybrid that starts his life in the wild and becomes more of a tamed animal after he goes to the Indian camp\n* [[Klaus Maria Brandauer]] as Alex Larson, an experienced, but gruff miner who knew Jack's father\n* [[Seymour Cassel]] as Clarence 'Skunker' Thurston, Alex's companion\n* [[Susan Hogan (actor)|Susan Hogan]] as Belinda Casey, Alex's lover\n* [[James Remar]] as Beauty Smith, a villainous dogfighter who buys up White Fang to fight dogs\n* Pius Savage as Grey Beaver, a Native American chief who is White Fang's first master\n* [[Bill Moseley]] as Luke, Beauty Smith's colleague\n* Clint Youngreen as Tinker, Beauty Smith's colleague\n* Suzanne Kent as Heather, Belinda's best friend\n* Michael Davis Lally as Sykes, Beauty Smith's archrival\n* Aaron Hotch as Mit-sah, Grey Beaver's son\n* Diane E.
