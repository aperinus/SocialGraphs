Press release. Retrieved on 6 April 2009.</ref>\n\n== Plot ==\n''For a detailed account of the plot, see main article: [[Emma (novel)]]''\n\nAusten's classic comic novel follows the story of the \"handsome, clever and rich\" Emma Woodhouse. Dominating the small provincial world of Highbury, Emma believes she is a skilled matchmaker and repeatedly attempts to pair up her friends and acquaintances. Nothing delights her more than meddling in the love lives of others. But when she takes prot\u00e9g\u00e9e Harriet Smith under her wing, her interference has a detrimental effect.\n\nBrought up sharply against the folly of her own immaturity, the consequent crisis and her bitter regrets are brought to a happy resolution in a comedy of self-deceit and self-discovery.\n\n== Cast and characters ==\n\n=== Main ===\n* [[Romola Garai]] as [[Emma Woodhouse]]: In Austen's opening lines of the novel: \"Emma Woodhouse, handsome, clever, and rich, with a comfortable home and happy disposition, seemed to unite some of the best blessings of existence; and had lived nearly twenty-one years in the world with very little to distress or vex her.\" Emma has no need to marry, being head of her own household, and having plenty of money, but she delights in matchmaking those around her \u2014 and credits herself with being very good at it \u2013 despite Mr. Knightley's scepticism.\n* [[Jonny Lee Miller]] as Mr. [[George Knightley]]: Mr. Knightley is Emma's only social and intellectual equal in Highbury, living at Donwell Abbey, a rambling country estate a short walk from Hartfield. He has known Emma since she was in diapers, and there's an easy familiarity between them. He is an individual, quick-witted, with a dry sense of humour \u2014 often used in sparring with Emma. But he also has a strong moral compass \u2014 and at times he strongly disagrees with Emma over her behaviour.\n* [[Michael Gambon]] as [[Mr. Woodhouse]]: Mr. Woodhouse is described by Austen as a valetudinarian \u2014 old before his time. He lost his wife when his two daughters were very young, and has developed an extremely nervous disposition. He is a loving and kind father, but he worries constantly, especially about health. He hardly ever leaves Hartfield, and hates the thought of Emma ever leaving him. He even sees the marriages of Isabella, Emma\u2019s older sister, to Mr. John Knightley, and Miss Taylor, Emma\u2019s beloved governess, to Mr. Weston, as disruptions to the life he leads with them.\n* Louise Dylan as Harriet Smith: Harriet is a [[parlour boarder]] at Mrs. Goddard's School. She has been sent there to be educated, by her father, who remains anonymous, because Harriet is his \"natural daughter\" \u2014 i.e., she's illegitimate. Being a parlour boarder means that she has stayed on at the school to help with the other girls. She's pretty, but in reality, she has little prospect of marrying a gentleman. Emma, however, is sure that Harriet's anonymous father must be a gentleman, and takes her under her wing.\n* [[Jodhi May]] as Anne Taylor/Weston: Anne has been Emma's governess since her mother died when Emma was a baby. More like a sister than a governess, Anne is wise and caring, but devoted to Emma and perhaps a little indulgent. When she marries Mr. Weston, she is worried about leaving Emma on her own at Hartfield.\n* [[Robert Bathurst]] as [[Mr. Weston]]: Mr. Weston is an eternal optimist, despite the fact that his life has not always run smoothly. He married young, to a woman who spent all his money, who was disowned by her family, and then died, leaving him with Frank, his two-year-old son. He agreed for Frank to be adopted by his wife's estranged sister, who insisted that he change his name to Frank Churchill. Frank has lived in the lap of luxury ever since.\n* [[Rupert Evans]] as Frank Churchill: Frank is a ball of energy, charming, mischievous, and spoilt. He has been kept at his manipulative aunt's beck and call for most of his life, and often seems to be called back to her bedside whenever he ventures away \u2014 although it is never entirely clear whether this is just a convenient excuse for not visiting Highbury and his father. At his worst, he could be a rogue \u2014 and he seems to delight in gossiping about Jane Fairfax.\n* [[Laura Pyper]] as Jane Fairfax: Jane's parents died when she was a toddler. Her aunt, Miss Bates, and grandmother Mrs. Bates sent her from Highbury to live with the Campbells, who could offer greater advantages. Captain Campbell knew she would be a good companion for his only daughter, Miss Campbell. Ever since, Jane has excelled at everything a girl should, and Miss Bates has bored Emma rigid with Jane's virtues at every opportunity. Now Jane has reached the age where she must leave the Campbells and return to Highbury, and finding means to make a living, most likely as a governess  \u2014 however, what is the real reason for her return?\n* [[Tamsin Greig]] as [[Miss Bates]]: Miss Bates is the daughter of the former vicar of Highbury, who died many years ago. She has never married, and now never will. Without a husband to provide an income, she faces ever-increasing poverty. Despite her woes, Miss Bates has a perennially cheerful disposition. She fills any silence with incessant talk.\n* [[Valerie Lilley]] as Mrs. Bates: Where Miss Bates talks non stop, her aged mother, Mrs. Bates, never speaks. She sits quietly in the corner of the room, or is wheeled from place to place by Miss Bates, revealing very little of what she really thinks of their situation.\n* [[Blake Ritson]] as Mr. Elton: Mr. Elton is the vicar of Highbury. In the early 19th century, the post of vicar could be given, inherited, or bought, and conferred a certain social status as well as an annual income. Mr. Elton is a dashing young man, aware of his status in the village, and his eligibility. He's charming \u2014 perhaps, at times, a little too charming, aiming at an advantageous marriage.\n* [[Christina Cole]] as Augusta Elton: Mrs. Elton is rich, and a good catch for Mr. Elton in many ways. However she's also vulgar and interfering, and one-upmanship is second nature to her. She arrives in Highbury keen to prove her social standing, and immediately puts Emma's nose out of joint.\n\n=== Recurring ===\n* [[Dan Fredenburgh]] as John Knightley\n* [[Poppy Miller]] as Isabella Knightley\n* [[Jefferson Hall (actor)|Jefferson Hall]] as Robert Martin\n* [[Veronica Roberts]] as Mrs. Goddard\n* [[Liza Sadovy]] as Mrs. Cole\n* [[Eileen O'Higgins]] as Miss Martin 1\n* Sarah Ovens as Miss Martin 2\n* Susie Trayling as Mrs. Churchill\n* Frank Doody as Mr. Dixon\n* Amy Loughton as Miss Campbell / Mrs. Dixon\n\n== Production ==\nPrincipal photography commenced with a four-day shoot in the [[Kent]] village of [[Chilham]] from 14 to 18 April 2009.

He nevertheless praised the acting, suggesting Garai's \"eyes alone deserve a BAFTA\" and that Michael Gambon made \"a splendid old Mr. Woodhouse\".<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2009/oct/05/sam-wollaston-tv-review | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=Emma | first=Sam | last=Wollaston | date=5 October 2009 | access-date=2 May 2010 | archive-date=4 March 2016 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304074340/http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2009/oct/05/sam-wollaston-tv-review | url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nJohn Preston of ''[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]'' also noted Romola Garai as \"particularly good\" in the titular role, and noted that while Jim O Hanlon's direction was perhaps a little too \"steady and sure\" there was still \"plenty of sprightliness there too\".<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/6270024/Emma---Criminal-Justice---When-Boris-Met-Dave-TV-review.html | work=The Daily Telegraph | location=London | title=Emma \u2013 Criminal Justice \u2013 When Boris Met Dave: TV review John Preston reviews BBC One's new Jane Austen adaptation Emma, the new series of Criminal Justice starring Maxine Peake, plus More4's real life-inspired drama When Boris Met Dave. | date=9 October 2009 | access-date=2 May 2010 | archive-date=13 October 2009 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091013113735/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/6270024/Emma---Criminal-Justice---When-Boris-Met-Dave-TV-review.html | url-status=dead }}</ref> After the third episode of the series, however, he wrote that \"[it] was a disaster, becoming ever more coarse and clumsy as it went on.

He also saw a casting problem with Emma and Knightley in the sense that Miller \"still carrie[d] too much of the seductive bad boy about him\" so that he was not convincing as a \"surprising love object\", and \"that threatens one of the novel's great achievements, which is to educate us alongside its heroine.\"<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/reviews/the-weekends-television-emma-sun-bbc1brmonty-python-ndash-almost-the-truth-the-bbc-lawyers-cut-sat-bbc2-1797676.html | work=The Independent | location=London | first=Tom | last=Sutcliffe | date=5 October 2009 | access-date=2 May 2010 | title=The Weekend's Television: Emma, Sun, BBC1 Monty Python \u2013 Almost the Truth: the BBC Lawyers' Cut, Sat, BBC2 | archive-date=8 October 2009 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091008130345/http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/reviews/the-weekends-television-emma-sun-bbc1brmonty-python-ndash-almost-the-truth-the-bbc-lawyers-cut-sat-bbc2-1797676.html | url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nSome critics also noted the dip in ratings following the first episode. In ''[[The Independent]]'', Jonathon Brown observed that while \"the critics have given it a qualified nod of approval\" the second instalment of the serial \"pulled in only 3.5 million viewers \u2013 down nearly 1 million on the opening episode the previous week \u2013 while the third episode saw another 200,000 switch off\". He suggests this may be due to the \"13 million-strong audience from [[ITV1]]'s all-conquering [[The X Factor (UK)|X Factor]]\" which had launched a Sunday night results show for the first time, or that \"the days of bonnet and bustle are [simply] over\".<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/tv-radio/has-the-costume-drama-had-its-day-1806884.html | work=The Independent | location=London | title=Costume drama: past it? | date=22 October 2009 | access-date=2 May 2010 | archive-date=4 November 2012 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121104193551/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/tv-radio/has-the-costume-drama-had-its-day-1806884.html | url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n=== Accolades ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
