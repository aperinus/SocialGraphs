Alienated and tired of life in Senegal, they dream of going to Paris and come up with different schemes to raise money for the trip. Mory eventually succeeds in stealing the money, and a large amount of clothing, from the household of a wealthy homosexual while the latter is taking a shower. Anta and Mory can finally buy tickets for the ship to France. But their wealthy victim phones the police who begin to tail the duo, and when Anta and Mory board the ship in the Port of Dakar the loudspeaker summons Mory to see the captain. Upon hearing this, Mory leaves Anta and runs away madly to find his bull-horned motorcycle, only to see that it has been ruined in a crash that nearly killed the rider who had taken it. The ship sails away with Anta but not Mory, who sits next to his hat on the ground, staring disconsolately at his wrecked motorcycle.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[:fr:Aminata Fall|Aminata Fall]] as Aunt Oumy\n* Ousseynou Diop as Charlie\n* Magaye Niang as Mory\n* Mareme Niang as Anta\n\n==Production==\n{{Expand section|date=February 2011}}\nBased on his own story and script, Djibril Diop Mamb\u00e9ty made ''Touki Bouki'' with a budget of $30,000 &ndash; obtained in part from the Senegalese government. Though influenced by [[French New Wave]], ''Touki Bouki'' displays a style all its own. Its camerawork and soundtrack have a frenetic rhythm uncharacteristic of most African films &ndash; known for their often deliberately slow-paced, linearly evolving narratives. However, it has been asserted that the jump cuts and radical spatial shifts of the film are inspired by African oral traditions.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Russell, Sharon A., 1941-|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/55638413|title=Guide to African cinema|date=1998|publisher=Greenwood Press|isbn=978-1-4294-7633-1|location=Westport, Conn.|oclc=55638413}}</ref><ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Snell|first=Heather|date=2014-05-04|title=Toward 'a giving and a receiving': teaching Djibril Diop Mamb\u00e9ty's Touki Bouki|url=https://doi.org/10.1080/13696815.2013.849194|journal=Journal of African Cultural Studies|volume=26|issue=2|pages=127\u2013139|doi=10.1080/13696815.2013.849194|s2cid=191339099|issn=1369-6815}}</ref> The word \"Bouki\" in the title refers to a popular folk character, known for causing mischief and cheating his way to what he wants.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Wynchank|first=Anny|date=January 1998|title=Touki-Bouki: The New Wave on the cinematic shores of Africa|journal=South African Theatre Journal|language=en-ca|volume=12|issue=1\u20132|pages=53\u201372|doi=10.1080/10137548.1998.9687665|issn=1013-7548}}</ref> Through jump cuts, colliding montage, dissonant sonic accompaniment, and the [[Contrast (linguistics)|juxtaposition]] of premodern, pastoral and modern sounds and visual elements, Touki Bouki conveys and grapples with the hybridization of [[Senegal]].<ref>{{Cite web|last=Mambu|first=Djia|title=Touki Bouki: The greatest African film ever?|url=https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20181105-touki-bouki-the-greatest-african-film-ever|access-date=2021-01-29|website=www.bbc.com|language=en}}</ref>\n\nWest African cinema contemporaneous with ''Touki Bouki'' was primarily financed and distributed by the French Ministry of Cooperation's Bureau du Cinema, which ensured that scripts had to conform to cinematographic standards acceptable to the French Government. ''Touki Bouki,'' in contrast, was made without any French financial assistance, allowing Mamb\u00e9ty relatively significant autonomy in production of the film. Mamb\u00e9ty's ready adoption of French New Wave techniques was to a degree motivated by meagre financial resources, circumstances similar to those of the film-makers of the early French New Wave.<ref name=\":1\" /> Narrative and cinematographic techniques associated with the [[Western (genre)|Western]] genre (known for dehumanizing depictions of Native Americans and minorities) were also subversively utilized by Mamb\u00e9ty in the production of the film.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nDuring the production of ''Touki Bouki'', Mamb\u00e9ty was arrested for participating in anti-racist protests in [[Rome]], and bailed out by lawyers from the [[Italian Communist Party]] after appeals from friends such as [[Bernardo Bertolucci]] and [[Sophia Loren]]. The experience of receiving a request from the Italian Communist Party to compensate them for the legal fees spent in his defence served as an inspiration for a character in his later film, ''[[Hyenas (1992 film)|Hy\u00e8nes.]]''<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Bakupa-Kanyinda|first=Balufu|date=1998|title=Djibril Diop Mambety.
