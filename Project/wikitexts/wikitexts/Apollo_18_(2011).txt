A Canadian-American co-production, its premise is that the [[Canceled Apollo missions|cancelled Apollo 18 mission]] actually landed on the Moon in December 1974, but never returned, and as a result the United States has never launched another expedition to the Moon. The film is shot in [[Found footage (film technique)|found-footage]] style, supposedly \"lost footage\" of the Apollo 18 mission that was only recently discovered.\n\n''Apollo 18'' is L\u00f3pez-Gallego's first English-language film. After various release date changes, the film was released in the United States, United Kingdom, and Canada on September 2, 2011. However, the release dates for other territories vary.<ref name=\"avc\" /> The film received mostly negative reviews, with most critics comparing it negatively to ''[[Paranormal Activity]]'', ''[[The Blair Witch Project]]'' and ''[[Alien (film)|Alien]]''.\n\n==Plot==\nIn December 1974, (Two years after the [[Apollo 17]] mission) the crew of the cancelled Apollo 18 mission is informed that it will now proceed as a top secret [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] (DoD) mission, disguised as a classified DoD, massive payload. [[Commander (United States)|Commander]] Nathan Walker, [[Lieutenant colonel (United States)|Lieutenant Colonel]] John Grey, and [[Captain (United States O-6)|Captain]] Ben Anderson are launched, at night, toward the [[Moon]] to place detectors to alert the United States of any impending [[ICBM]] attacks from the [[Soviet Union|USSR]].\n\nGrey remains in orbit aboard the [[Apollo command module]] ''Freedom'' while Walker and Anderson land on the South Pole of the Moon in the [[Apollo Lunar Module]] ''Liberty,'' on December 25. While planting the PSD5 detector, the pair take rock samples which Anderson describes as feeling \"strange\". In the background, the camera captures a rock moving in a nearby crater. After returning to ''Liberty'', the pair hear noises outside and the motion sensor camera captures a small rock moving nearby. Houston claims the noises are interference from the ICBM detector. The next day, Anderson finds a rock sample on the floor of ''Liberty'' despite having secured the samples. During their ICBM detector set-up, Anderson discovers footprints that lead them to a bloodstained and abandoned (but still functional) Soviet [[LK (spacecraft)|LK lander]]. Anderson explores a nearby crater, describing the ground as \"feeling softer\". Inside the crater, he finds a [[Lost Cosmonauts|dead cosmonaut]] as well as a broken space helmet. Walker queries Houston about the Soviet presence, but he is told only to continue with the mission. While they are sleeping, Walker is woken by strange noises and something bumping into the lander.\n\nThe following day, the pair find that the flag they had planted is missing. Having completed their mission, the duo prepares to leave, but the launch is aborted when ''Liberty'' suffers violent shaking. An inspection reveals extensive damage to the module. Walker finds their shredded flag nearby; the motion sensor camera is also missing, and the rover tipped on its side. He then finds non-human tracks outside ''Liberty'', and cites them as evidence of [[extraterrestrial life]]. Walker feels something moving inside his spacesuit and is horrified as a spider-like creature crawls across the inside of his helmet; he disappears from view and Anderson finds him unconscious outside of ''Liberty''. Walker later denies the events. A wound is discovered on his chest, and Anderson removes a [[Moon rock]] embedded within him. After having removed the rock, Walker smashes it with a hammer, contaminating the ship. The pair find themselves unable to contact Houston or Grey due to increased levels of interference from an unknown source.\n\nAnderson speculates that the true purpose of the \"ICBM warning device\" is to monitor the aliens, and that it is the source of the interference. Anderson and Walker attempt to switch the device off, only to discover it has been destroyed, with the same non-human tracks surrounding it. Walker shows signs of a developing infection, such as vein discoloration (possibly caused by [[necrosis]]) and [[Subconjunctival bleeding|blood-shot eyes]], and he becomes contentious and paranoid. The mission cameras capture a rock sample moving around in the interior of ''Liberty'', revealing that the aliens are camouflaged as Moon rocks. Increasingly delusional, Walker attempts to destroy the cameras within ''Liberty'' with a hammer, but he accidentally damages other controls, causing ''Liberty'' to depressurize. Realizing the Soviet LK lander is their only source of oxygen, the pair travel to the LK lander in their [[Lunar Roving Vehicle|Lunar rover]]. Walker becomes agitated, believing he should not leave the Moon because of the risk of spreading the infection to Earth, and causes the rover to crash. As the rover crashes, the camera catches glimpses of the large space rocks, which begin to grow legs similar to that of [[spiders]].\n\nAnderson awakens and tracks Walker to a crater. Walker is pulled into the crater by the creatures. Anderson gives chase, but he is confronted by the aliens, and flees to the Soviet LK and uses its radio to contact USSR Mission Control, who connect him to the Department of Defense. The [[United States Deputy Secretary of Defense|Deputy Secretary]] informs Anderson that they cannot allow him to return to Earth, admitting they are aware of the situation and incorrectly believe he is also infected. Anderson manages to contact Grey and they make arrangements for Anderson to return to ''Freedom''. Anderson prepares the lander for launch, but Walker arrives, revealing that he survived the alien encounter and demanding to be let in. However, he is now completely psychotic and when Anderson refuses to let him in, he tries to break the lander's window with a hammer. Before Walker can enter the vehicle, he is swarmed with rock aliens which break his helmet open and kill him; his body is dragged away by a much larger alien rock.\n\nAnderson launches, but the DoD tells Grey that Anderson is infected, and orders him to abort the rescue or ground communication (without which the CSM will be unable to return to Earth) will be cut off. The lander's engines shut off as it enters orbit; while it is in free fall, small rocks within the craft float in the air, some of which reveal themselves to be rock aliens. Anderson is attacked and infected by the rock aliens, preventing him from controlling the vehicle. Grey warns Anderson that he is approaching too fast, and the footage ends abruptly, implying that the LK and ''Freedom'' collided.\n\nThe film concludes with a statement giving the \"official\" fate of the astronauts, describing them as having been killed in various jet accidents that left their bodies unrecoverable. An epilogue notes that many of the hundreds of rock samples returned from the previous Apollo missions, given to [https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/dignitary dignitaries], are now missing.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Warren Christie]] as Lunar Module Pilot Captain Benjamin \"Ben\" Anderson\n* [[Lloyd Owen]] as Commander Nathan \"Nate\" Walker\n* [[Ryan Robbins]] as Command Module Pilot Lieutenant Colonel John \u201cJohnny\u201d Grey\n* [[Andrew Airlie]] as CAPCOM (Thomas Young)\n* [[Michael Kopsa]] as Deputy Secretary of Defense\n\n==Production==\n''Apollo 18'' was shot in [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bcfilmcommission.com/database/rte/files/Jan%2011,%202011%20-%20BCFC%20Film%20List.pdf |title=British Columbia Film Commission Film List: January 11, 2011 |publisher=British Columbia Film Commission |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928104039/http://www.bcfilmcommission.com/database/rte/files/Jan%2011%2C%202011%20-%20BCFC%20Film%20List.pdf |archive-date=September 28, 2011 }}</ref> However, it has been promoted as a \"found footage\" film that does not use actors.

He is killed when an alien breaks his helmet visor.\n\nOther deleted scenes show two alternate versions of the dead cosmonaut.\nVersion 1: Walker and Anderson find the cosmonaut's helmet but no Soviet ship. They then find the cosmonaut's body dragged many meters away.  \nVersion 2: The same as the first but the cosmonaut is partially buried.\n\nAnother alternate scene shows Anderson leaving a picture of his family on the surface as he swears that he will get home. As he does, the rocks aliens begin to stalk him. Anderson spots the Soviet lander in the distance and narrowly makes it inside as the aliens chase after him.\n\nIn another deleted scene, Grey survives the ordeal and argues with a DoD official back on Earth, who reveals that the astronauts were sent to the Moon to get infected and return to Earth so the United States could use the alien venom as a [[Biological agent|Bioweapon]] against the Soviet Union, which is conducting human experiments with the venom.\n\n==== Alternate endings ====\n\nIn the first ending, Anderson is in the LK after being attacked by Walker. Anderson is surrounded by the aliens as the LK loses oxygen, and he dies. An alien then leaves the shot.\n\nIn the second ending, Anderson is talking with DoD in the LK and sees the veins in his arms turning black, showing he is infected. The infection overtakes him, and he begins to smash the control panel in rage before breaking the camera, leaving his fate unknown.\n\nIn the third ending, Anderson is in the LK, with the aliens trying to break in. Suddenly, a large alien breaks the window of the LK and kills Anderson with a pincer.\n\nIn the fourth and final ending, an infected Anderson is in the LK. An alarm begins to sound as the lander plummets back to the Moon. The LK impacts with the surface of the Moon.\n\n==Release==\n''Apollo 18'' was released on September 2, 2011, in multiple countries.
