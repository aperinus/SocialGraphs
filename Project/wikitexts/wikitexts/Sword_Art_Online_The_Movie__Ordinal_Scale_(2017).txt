American Premiere in Hollywood on March 1 Before Wider Screenings|date=November 11, 2016|website=[[Anime News Network]]|access-date=November 28, 2020}}</ref> The events of the film take place between the [[Sword Art Online II|second]] and [[Sword Art Online: Alicization|third]] seasons of the ''Sword Art Online'' anime series.\n\n==Plot==\nIn the year 2026, the Augma is released to the public as an alternative system to the AmuSphere, as it [[augmented reality|projects a game layer on top of reality]] while the player is conscious, rather than using [[virtual reality|FullDive]]. The most prominent combat-based game is Ordinal Scale, in which a player's abilities are ranked by [[ordinal number]]s.\n\nAsuna, Lisbeth and Silica encourage Kirito to play OS upon hearing that Aincrad bosses have appeared. Kirito joins Asuna and Klein in a boss fight against Kagachi the Samurai Lord at Akihabara, where the game's mascot, [[Virtual idol|AI idol singer]] Yuna, appears and gives players buff effects as she sings. Kirito fails to achieve anything due to lack of real world physical strength and agility. Eiji, the number-two ranked player, aids the group in defeating the boss. Before Asuna makes the killing blow, Eiji whispers the word \"Switch,\" a game mechanic from SAO that she recognizes.\n\nThe next night, Asuna joins Klein and his group for another boss fight at Yoyogi Park while waiting for their last group member, unaware that he was injured by Eiji the night before. Asuna leaves Klein and his guild behind and proceeds to the fight against the Storm Griffin, which is again presided over by Yuna. Klein and his guild are surprised by the sudden appearance of a second boss, Zanghi the Flame Caller, and shockingly supported by Eiji, who physically attacks and defeats Klein and his entire guild in the real world using superior reflexes and seemingly superhuman strength. When Asuna returns to where she left them, Klein and his guild are nowhere to be seen. The following morning, as Kirito practices with OS in Yoyogi Park, a girl he doesn't know appears in a white hood, mouths something wordlessly and points off into the distance before disappearing. A confused Kirito is surprised by Asuna who has arrived to have lunch with him. While eating together, Asuna theorizes that Eiji was a former member of the Knights of the Blood Oath named Nautilus, while Yui deduces that the spawn locations of the Aincrad bosses line up with the SAO dungeon maps. Noting the absence of Klein, Kirito tries to check up on him.\n\nAsuna, Lisbeth and Silica join the boss fight against Strict Hermit at Yebisu Garden Place, where Yuna and Eiji appear again. At the same time, Agil contacts Kirito and tells him that Klein has been hospitalized with a broken arm; Kirito, alarmed, rushes to protect Asuna and their friends. During the boss battle, a second boss, Dorz\u2019l the Chaos Drake, suddenly appears and fixates on Silica. Eiji blocks Silica's escape by pushing her into the path of a lethal boss attack, and Asuna is defeated while protecting her; an orange orb materializes from Asuna and is quickly collected by one of the OS drones. After the battle, Asuna begins to suffer memory loss, and goes to the hospital for examination.\n\nAsuna learns that the Augma device scanned her brain specifically for SAO memories and that the memory loss could worsen. After Asuna's condition worsens, Kirito gains a strong resolve to solve the mystery. Kirito visits Klein in the hospital and confirms that Klein's SAO memories are also missing. Kirito goes to the Dire Tusk boss battle at Tokyo Dome City looking for Eiji, where he is joined by Sinon; although he is concerned for her safety, Sinon reminds Kirito that she is not an SAO survivor. During the boss battle, an SAO survivor is defeated and Kirito witnesses a glowing memory orb being collected by an OS drone. Yui tries to retrieve the memory orb from the drone but fails after being blocked by the OS system. After the battle, Kirito is frustrated that Eiji did not show up, but meets the hooded girl a third time, who repeats her actions from before. Kirito and Yui figure out that she is pointing towards Touto Technical University.\n\nKirito goes to the university and meets Professor Tetsuhiro Shigemura, who developed Augma. Shigemura refuses to answer any questions. Before leaving, Kirito notices on Shigemura's desk a picture of a girl who resembles Yuna. Kirito talks to Seijir\u014d Kikuoka, who informs him that Shigemura's daughter, Yuna, died in SAO. Kirito warns Kikuoka that the memory loss may be affecting other SAO survivors playing OS. Visiting Asuna's home, Kirito promises Asuna that he will get her memories back. While searching for clues, Kirito encounters the hooded girl yet again, who he confirms is Yuna. When she tells him his rank is too low, Kirito decides to level up hardcore, recklessly chain-soloing as many bosses as he can, and improving his AR swordwork with help from Leafa.\n\nDays later, the OS players gather at the Tokyo National Stadium for Yuna's first live concert. In the lower levels, Kirito duels with Eiji, who claims he has a way to return Asuna's memories. After Kirito defeats him, Eiji reveals that Shigemura has been harvesting memories of SAO players in an attempt to reconstruct his lost daughter's soul and resurrect her as an AI; having SAO survivors concentrated in one place is the final stage of the plan and Eiji believes he has won. Kirito rushes back upstairs to warn everyone, calling Kikuoka on the way. Kikuoka warns Kirito that all the memory harvesting drones scanning everyone at once could damage the players' brains, killing them like the NerveGear did in SAO.\n\nAs a horde of Aincrad bosses appear and terrorize the stadium, Kirito and Yuna join the battle. Yuna tells Kirito that the Augma has a hidden full-dive feature and he can use it to defeat SAO's 100th floor boss to stop the scan and save everyone. Before diving, Kirito gives Asuna an engagement ring. Entering the Ruby Palace of Floor 100, Kirito, Lisbeth, Silica, Agil, and Sinon confront the boss. They are easily overwhelmed until Asuna, Leafa, Klein, and several other memorable players from ALO and GGO come to their aid. Yui restores their saved abilities from SAO, allowing everyone to defeat the boss. The voice of Akihiko Kayaba congratulates them on their victory and gives Kirito an extremely powerful sword as a reward.\n\nThe group returns to the arena still in full-dive where Kirito, now OS's top-ranked player, effortlessly dispatches the bosses with his new sword. Meanwhile, in the real world, Kikuoka finds Shigemura in the abandoned server room of Argus (the defunct company that once ran SAO) and arrests him. The hooded Yuna restores the survivors' memories and fades out of existence since her existence was tied to that of the Floor 100 boss. Afterwards, Kirito and Asuna fulfill the promise they made to each other in Aincrad, to watch a meteor shower together. Asuna returns Kirito's promise ring so he can properly put it on her hand this time, which he does.\n\nIn a post-credits scene, Kikuoka, who was impressed with Shigemura's attempt at AI and soul reconstruction, recruits Shigemura to Rath.\n\n==Voice cast==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
