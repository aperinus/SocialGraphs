Adapted from [[Wajdi Mouawad]]'s play of the [[Incendies (play)|same name]], ''Incendies'' stars [[Lubna Azabal]], [[M\u00e9lissa D\u00e9sormeaux-Poulin]], [[Maxim Gaudette]], and [[R\u00e9my Girard]].\n\nThe story concerns Canadian twins who travel to their mother's native country in the [[Middle East]] to uncover her hidden past amidst a bloody civil war. While the country is unnamed, the events in the film are heavily influenced by the [[Lebanese Civil War]] and particularly the story of prisoner [[Souha Bechara]]. The film was shot mainly in Montreal, with a few days spent in Jordan.\n\nIt premiered at the [[Venice Film Festival|Venice]] and [[Toronto International Film Festival|Toronto]] Film Festivals in September 2010 and was released in [[Quebec]] on 17 September 2010. It met with critical acclaim in Canada and abroad and won numerous awards.\n\nIn 2011, it was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film]]. ''Incendies'' also won eight [[31st Genie Awards|Genie Awards]], including [[Canadian Screen Award for Best Motion Picture|Best Motion Picture]].\n\n==Plot==\nFollowing the death of their mother Nawal, an [[Arab Canadians|Arab]] [[Immigration to Canada|immigrant in Canada]], Jeanne and her twin brother Simon meet with [[French Canadian]] notary Jean Lebel, their mother's employer and family friend. Nawal's will makes reference to not keeping a promise, denying her a proper gravestone and casket, unless Jeanne and Simon track down their mysterious brother, whose existence they were previously unaware of, and their father, who they believed was dead. Nawal has left two letters; one is to be delivered to Jeanne and Simon's father, and the other is to be delivered to their brother. Jeanne accepts; Simon, on the other hand, seemingly having had a more difficult relationship with Nawal and her apparently unusual personality, is reluctant to join Jeanne on this pursuit.\n\nA series of [[Flashback (narrative)|flashbacks]] reveal Nawal came from a [[Arab Christians|Christian Arab]] family in an unnamed [[Middle East]]ern country, and that she fell in love with a [[refugee]] named Wahab, resulting in her pregnancy. Her family murders her lover and nearly shoots her as an [[honour killing]], but her grandmother spares her, making her promise to leave the village after the birth of her baby and start a new life in the fictional city of Daresh. The grandmother tattoos the back of the baby's heel and sends him to an orphanage.\n\nWhile Nawal is at university in Daresh, a civil war and [[war crimes]] break out with Nawal opposing the war on [[human rights]] grounds. Her son's orphanage in Kfar Khout is destroyed by a Muslim militant, Chamseddine, who converts him into an Islamic [[child soldier]]. After barely escaping the massacre of a bus full of Muslim refugees by Christian Nationalists, Nawal narrowly manages to join the Muslim fighters, and eventually shoots a nationalist leader. She is imprisoned in Kfar Ryat and raped by torturer Abou Tarek, consequently giving birth to the twins.\n\nAfter travelling to her mother's native country, Jeanne gradually uncovers this past, and persuades Simon to join her. With help from Lebel, they learn their brother's name is Nihad of May and track down Chamseddine. Simon meets with him personally, and he reveals the war-mad Nihad was captured by the nationalists, turned by them, trained as a torturer, and then sent to Kfar Ryat, where he took the name Abou Tarek, making him both the twins' half-brother and father; as such, both letters are addressed to the same person. Like Nawal, Nihad's superiors gave him a new life in Canada after the war. By chance, Nawal encountered him at a Canadian swimming pool, and saw both the tattoo and his face. The shock of learning the truth caused Nawal to suffer a stroke which led to her decline and untimely death at age sixty.\n\nThe twins find Nihad in Canada and deliver Nawal's letters to him. He opens both of them; the first letter addresses him as the twins' father, the rapist, and is filled with contempt. The second letter addresses him as the twins' brother, and is instead written with caring words, saying that he, as Nawal's son, is deserving of love.\n\nNawal gets her gravestone.  Some time later, Nihad visits it.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Lubna Azabal]] as Nawal Marwan\n* [[M\u00e9lissa D\u00e9sormeaux-Poulin]] as Jeanne Marwan\n* [[Maxim Gaudette]] as Simon Marwan\n* [[R\u00e9my Girard]] as Jean Lebel\n* Abdelghafour Elaaziz as Abou Tarek/Nihad \"Nihad de Mai\" Harmanni\n* [[Allen Altman]] as Notary Maddad\n* Mohamed Majd as Chamseddine\n* Nabil Sawalha as Fahim\n* Baya Belal as Maika\n* Bader Alami as Nicolas\n* Karim Babin as Chamseddine's guard\n* Anthony Ecclissi as Lifeguard\n* Joyce Raie as Student Journalist\n* Yousef Shweihat as Sharif\n* Celine Soulier as French Journalist\n* Mher Karakashian as Chamseddine's assistant\n}}\n\n==Production==\n\n===Development===\n[[File:Denis Villeneuve Cannes 2015.jpg|upright|thumb|Director [[Denis Villeneuve]] adapted [[Wajdi Mouawad]]'s play ''[[Incendies (play)|Incendies]]'' after seeing it performed in Montreal in 2004.]]\nParts of the story were based on the life of [[Souha Bechara]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.dailystar.com.lb/Culture/Film/Feb/02/Seeing-yourself-re-made-as-fiction.ashx#axzz1bmmQmXor |title=Seeing yourself re-made as fiction |last=Snaije |first=Olivia |date=2 February 2011 |access-date=6 August 2016 |work=[[The Daily Star (Lebanon)|The Daily Star]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130916060318/http://dailystar.com.lb/Culture/Film/Feb/02/Seeing-yourself-re-made-as-fiction.ashx#axzz1bmmQmXor |archive-date=16 September 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.lapresse.ca/international/moyen-orient/200903/08/01-834313-lex-kamikaze-soha-bechara-denonce-le-sort-des-palestiniens.php |title=L'ex-kamikaze Soha B\u00e9chara d\u00e9nonce le sort des Palestiniens |last=Perreault |first=Laura-Julie |date=8 March 2009 |access-date=6 August 2016 |work=[[La Presse (Canadian newspaper)|La Presse]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161006205652/http://www.lapresse.ca/international/moyen-orient/200903/08/01-834313-lex-kamikaze-soha-bechara-denonce-le-sort-des-palestiniens.php |archive-date=6 October 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.mediationsjournal.org/articles/antigone-becomes-jocasta |title=Antigone Becomes Jocasta: Soha Bechara, ''R\u00e9sistante'', and ''Incendies'' |last=Holstun |first=Jim |date=Fall 2015 |access-date=19 July 2017 |work=[[Mediations (journal)|Mediations]] vol. 29, no. 1 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170303094320/http://www.mediationsjournal.org/articles/antigone-becomes-jocasta |archive-date=3 March 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref> The story is based on events that happened during the [[Lebanese Civil War]] of 1975 to 1990, but the filmmakers attempted to make the location of the plot ambiguous.<ref>{{cite news| first = Glenn| last = Sum| title = Denis is on Fire| publisher = Now Toronto| url = http://www.nowtoronto.com/movies/story.cfm?content=178802| date = 20 January 2011| access-date = 19 September 2011| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110813163917/http://www.nowtoronto.com/movies/story.cfm?content=178802| archive-date = 13 August 2011| url-status = live}}</ref><ref name=\"Nestruck\">{{cite news | url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/arts/movies/will-denis-villeneuves-incendies-light-a-fire-under-oscar/article1873366/page2/ | location=Toronto | work=[[The Globe and Mail]] | first=J.
