The cast also includes [[Glenne Headly]], [[Olympia Dukakis]], [[William H. Macy]], and [[Jay Thomas]].\n\nThe film was nominated for the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Screenplay]]. Richard Dreyfuss received nominations for the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor \u2013 Motion Picture Drama]] and the [[Academy Award for Best Actor]].\n\n==Plot==\nIn the fall of 1964, 30-year-old Glenn Holland is a successful and talented musician and [[composer (music)|composer]] from [[Portland, Oregon]]. He switches gears, taking a position as a music teacher at John F. Kennedy High School so that he can spend more time with his young wife Iris and work on his symphony. The film covers his 30-year teaching career, set amongst the changes in American society.\n\nHolland at first struggles in his new job, but learns how to connect with his students by using [[rock and roll]] and other popular music to convince them that music is a fun and worthwhile pursuit. He becomes a popular teacher at the school and rises to the task of creating a school marching band with help from the football coach, Bill Meister, with whom he becomes lifelong friends. Holland persuades principal Helen Jacobs to maintain funding for the school's arts programs, despite a shrinking budget and the objections of vice principal Gene Wolters.\n\nThe time Holland devotes to his classes, the marching band, orchestra, productions and mentoring both struggling and talented students leaves him little time to work on his symphony, or to spend with his family. When his son, Cole, is found to be [[Deafness|deaf]], he is severely disappointed that he will never be able to share his love of music. He fails to learn [[American Sign Language]] properly, leaving him unable to communicate with his son and creating a rift between him and Iris, who has to raise Cole mostly by herself. As the years progress, Holland grows closer to his students at Kennedy High and more distant from his own son. An argument with his teenage son finally makes Holland realize the error of his ways and he learns to communicate with his son and  help him visualize the music he can't hear, and repairs his relationship with his wife.\n\nIn 1995, Principal Wolters shuts down the school's arts programs, citing further cuts from the Education Board and the need to prioritize reading, writing and math, and Holland is laid off as a result. Holland makes an impassioned plea to the Board to no avail and becomes despondent, believing that his teaching career has amounted to nothing. On his last day, Holland's wife and son, now a teacher himself, help him clear out his office and take him to the auditorium. It is packed full of current and former students who greet him with a standing ovation. Gertrude Lang, a struggling clarinetist from Holland's first year teaching, who is now Governor of Oregon, gives a speech praising Mr. Holland, that his legacy is more than just the symphony; it is all the people he has helped and influenced over 30 years. She joins past members of the school's orchestra, who have been practicing the symphony, on stage. Mr. Holland conducts them in its premiere performance.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Richard Dreyfuss]] as Glenn Holland, a [[composer]] who becomes a music teacher at John F.
