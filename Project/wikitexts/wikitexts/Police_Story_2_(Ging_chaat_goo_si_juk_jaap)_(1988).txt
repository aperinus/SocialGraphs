It is a [[sequel]] to the hit 1985 film ''[[Police Story (1985 film)|Police Story]]'', continuing the storyline of Chan's character \"Kevin\" [[Chan Ka-kui]], and is the second installment of ''[[Police Story (film series)|Police Story]]'' series. It also marks the last appearance in the series for [[Lam Kwok-Hung]] as Chief Inspector Raymond Li, [[Chor Yuen]] as Chu Tao and [[Charlie Cho]] as John Ko.\n\n==Plot==\nSergeant [[Chan Ka-kui]] has been demoted to [[highway patrol]] as the result of his handling of his previous case, which involved the violent arrest of crime lord Chu Tao and heavy property damage. The new duty pleases his girlfriend, May, who is glad that her boyfriend is no longer taking difficult cases and has more time to see her.\n\nHowever, the happy mood changes when Ka-Kui is greeted by Chu Tao and his bespectacled right-hand man John Ko. It seems Chu Tao is terminally ill with only three months left to live, so he has been released from prison, and while he is still alive he vows to make life difficult for Ka-Kui.\n\nJohn Ko and some henchmen show up at Ka-Kui's apartment and intimidate him, baiting the policeman to attack. Later, May and her aunt are beaten by John Ko and his men. Ka-Kui can no longer hold back, and he lashes out against John Ko and his men at a restaurant.\n\nAshamed of his behavior, Ka-Kui resigns from the [[Royal Hong Kong Police Force]]. He plans to take a trip to [[Bali]] with May, but while he is at a travel agency in a [[shopping mall]], some police officers see him and report that the mall is under a bomb threat.\n\nUnable to resist the urge to get involved in police work, Ka-Kui tells the officers to sound the fire alarm and have the mall cleared, and agrees to take responsibility for the decision. A bomb does indeed explode, and the entire mall is leveled by the blast.\n\nKa-Kui is praised for his efforts, and he is reinstated and assigned to solve the case of the bombing. Ka-Kui plants a covert listening device in the mall property company's office to try to learn more about the bombers. This leads to a suspect who is a deaf-mute and is a fierce martial artist and explosives expert.\n\nThe bombing gang (four men consisting of the leader Tall Pau Hung aka The Polar Bear, Ken, and the two bomb experts, one of them being deaf-mute), also aware that the police are on to them, plan a simultaneous bombing of the property company and the police headquarters. They double their ransom demand to $20 million and kidnap May, luring Ka-Kui into a trap in which he is strapped with an explosive vest and forced to pick up the extortion money from the property company.\n\nAfter picking up the money, Ka-Kui tells the gang that they are being followed and split up. Ka-kui, still holding the ransom, is able to drive his car into a tunnel so that the bomb he is wearing cannot be activated and he strips it off. He then goes to rescue May, who is being held in a warehouse full of fireworks.\n\nAfter defeating other gang members, Ka-Kui again faces the deaf-mute man, who throws large [[bang snaps]] at him. Ka-Kui is unable to beat him hand-to-hand, but then gains the upper hand with brutally retaliation on the mute man by using his own bang snaps against him, and throwing him off a third story catwalk onto a pile of plastic drums below. Ka-Kui then rescues May and departs the warehouse, just as it explodes in a huge ball of fire.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Jackie Chan]] as Sergeant \"Kevin\" [[Chan Ka-kui]] a.k.a.
