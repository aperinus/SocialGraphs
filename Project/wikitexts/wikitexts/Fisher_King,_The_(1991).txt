Starring [[Robin Williams]] and [[Jeff Bridges]], with [[Mercedes Ruehl]], [[Amanda Plummer]], and [[Michael Jeter]] in supporting roles, the film tells the story of a [[radio]] [[shock jock]] who tries to find redemption by helping a man whose life he inadvertently shattered. It explores \"the intermingling of New York City's usually strictly separated social strata\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.criterion.com/current/posts/3606-michael-s-turn-michael-jeter-in-the-fisher-king|title=Michael's Turn: Michael Jeter in The Fisher King|first=Michael|last=Koresky|website=The Criterion Collection}}</ref> and has been described as \"a modern-day Grail Quest that fused New York romantic comedy with timeless fantasy\".<ref name=\"auto\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.rogerebert.com/features/retrieving-the-grail-robin-williams-and-the-fisher-king|title=Retrieving the Grail: Robin Williams and \"The Fisher King\" &#124; Features &#124; Roger Ebert|first=Niles|last=Schwartz|website=[[RogerEbert.com]]}}</ref>\n\nThe film was released in the United States by [[TriStar Pictures]] on September 20, 1991. It received generally favorable reviews from critics and grossed $72 million on a $24 million budget. At the [[64th Academy Awards]] the film earned five nominations, including [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] for Williams, with Ruehl winning [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]].\n\n==Plot==\nJack Lucas, a narcissistic, [[Misanthropy|misanthropic]] [[shock jock]], becomes suicidal and despondent when his insensitive on-air comments inadvertently prompt a mentally unstable caller to commit a [[mass murder|mass]] [[murder\u2013suicide]] at a [[Manhattan]] restaurant. Three years later, Jack is working for his girlfriend Anne in a video store, and is in a mostly drunken, depressed state.\n\nOne night, while [[Binge drinking|on a bender]], he contemplates suicide. However, he is attacked and nearly set on fire by thugs who mistake him for a homeless person. He is rescued by Parry, a delusional homeless man who claims his mission is to find the [[Holy Grail]].\n\nParry tries to enlist Jack's help in getting the grail, explaining that the [[Fisher King]] was charged by God with finding the Holy Grail, but incurred an incapacitating wound for his sin of [[Pride (sin)|pride]]. \"A Fool asks the King why he suffers, and when the King says he is thirsty, the Fool gives him a cup of water to drink. The King realizes the cup is the Grail and asks, 'How did you find what my brightest and bravest could not?' The Fool said 'I don't know. I only knew that you were thirsty.'\"\n\nJack is initially reluctant but acquiesces after learning that he is partially responsible for Parry's current condition. Parry, whose real name is Henry Sagan, had been a teacher at [[Hunter College]]. After witnessing his wife's gruesome death at the same mass shooting Jack had provoked, Henry had a [[psychotic break]] and became [[catatonic]]. When he woke, he had taken the persona of Parry and became obsessed with the legend of the Fisher King. With Parry as his shielding persona, mentions of reality panic him and he is continually haunted by a terrifying, hallucinatory [[Red Knight]], from a distorted memory of his wife's head exploding from a shotgun blast.\n\nJack seeks to redeem himself by helping Parry find love again. Lydia, a shy woman with whom Parry is smitten, is prodded into meeting Parry and joining Jack and Anne for a dinner date. Afterwards, Parry walks Lydia home and declares his love for her; she reciprocates, but the brush with reality summons the Red Knight. Fleeing his vision and the memory of his wife's murder, he is ambushed by the same thugs against whom he had defended Jack. Beaten mercilessly, Parry becomes catatonic again. Jack, feeling whole again after 'saving' Parry, breaks up with Anne and begins to rebuild his career, but has a crisis of conscience during a [[sitcom]] pitch after snubbing a vagrant who had previously done him a favor.\n\nAfter finding out what happened to Parry, Jack dons Parry's clothing and infiltrates the [[Upper East Side]] castle of a famous architect and retrieves the \"Grail\", a trophy which Parry believes to be the real Grail. During the theft, Jack finds the architect unconscious from attempting suicide. He triggers the alarm while leaving, alerting authorities and saving the man's life.\n\nWhen he brings the \u201cGrail\u201d to Parry, Parry regains consciousness and tells a silent Jack he's ready to miss his wife now. Lydia comes to visit Parry in the hospital; she finds him awake and leading the patients of the ward in a rendition of \"[[How About You?]]\" with Jack. Parry and Lydia embrace, and Jack reconciles with Anne, telling her that he loves her. She slaps him, but then grabs and kisses him. Later, Jack and Parry lie naked in [[Central Park]] gazing at the clouds, as a fireworks display over New York presents \"The End\".\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Robin Williams]] as Parry\n* [[Jeff Bridges]] as Jack Lucas\n* [[Mercedes Ruehl]] as Anne Napolitano\n* [[Amanda Plummer]] as Lydia Sinclair\n* [[Michael Jeter]] as Homeless Cabaret Singer\n* [[David Hyde Pierce]] as Lou Rosen\n* [[Lara Harris]] as Sondra\n* [[Harry Shearer]] as Ben Starr\n* [[Kathy Najimy]] as Crazed Video Customer\n* [[John de Lancie]] as TV Executive\n* [[Tom Waits]] as Disabled Veteran\n* [[Melinda Culea]] as Sitcom Wife \n* Paul Michael Lombardi as Radio Engineer\n}}\n\n==Production==\nDuring an appearance on an episode of ''The Directors'', Gilliam stated that he wanted to do the film because he was tired of big budget special effects films, such as his previous film ''[[The Adventures of Baron Munchausen]]'', which went over budget and cost over $45 million, nearly twice as much as ''The Fisher King'''s budget of $24 million. This was the first film Gilliam directed in which he was not involved in writing the [[screenplay]], as well as his first film not to feature any other members of [[Monty Python]].\n\nAccording to ''The Directors'' episode, Gilliam came up with the scene where Robin Williams and Amanda Plummer meet during a huge waltz in the middle of [[Grand Central Terminal]], because he felt the scene LaGravenese had written, in which a large group of people in a crowded subway listen to a homeless woman sing with a beautiful voice that fills the room, wasn't working. He was hesitant about this at first, because his original intentions were just to shoot the script and the waltz would make it \"a Terry Gilliam film\". The scene was shot in one night with a mix of professional extras and passengers alighting from the train.\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Box office===\nThe film did moderately well at the box office,<ref>{{cite news|title= Weekend Box Office 'House Party 2' Takes Top Spot |work= [[The Los Angeles Times]]|date=1991-10-29|url= http://articles.latimes.com/1991-10-29/entertainment/ca-481_1_house-party|access-date=2011-01-01|first=David J.|last=Fox}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title= Terminator 2 About to Hit $200-Million Mark : Movies: While fall releases are in box-office slump, the summer smash climbs to 13th on all-time domestic ticket sales list.  |work= [[The Los Angeles Times]]|date=1991-10-31|url= http://articles.latimes.com/1991-10-31/entertainment/ca-816_1_box-offices/2|access-date=2011-01-01|first=David J.|last=Fox}}</ref> with a gross of almost $42 million in the United States and Canada,<ref name=\"allmovie\">{{cite web|url=http://allmovie.com/work/77235|title=The Fisher King > Overview |publisher=Rovi Corporation|work=AllMovie.com |access-date=2010-10-22}}</ref> and an international gross of $30.5 milion,<ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Daily Variety]]|date=June 26, 1992|last=Evan Frook|first=John|title=Col TriStar tide rising overseas|page=1}}</ref> for a worldwide total of $72.4 million.\n\n===Critical response===\n\n[[Peter Travers]] of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' wrote that the film \"sweeps you up on waves of humor, heartbreak and ravishing romance\".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/reviews/the-fisher-king-19910920 |title=The Fisher King |first=Peter |last=Travers |author-link=Peter Travers |date=September 20, 1991 |work=[[Rolling Stone]] |access-date=June 15, 2018}}</ref> [[John Simon (critic)|John Simon]] of the conservative [[National Review]] described ''The Fisher King'' as \"one of the most nonsensical, pretentious, mawkishly cloying movies I ever had to wretch through\", due to its humanising depiction of the homeless.<ref>{{cite book |title=John Simon on Film: Criticism 1982-2001|last1=Simon|first1=John |publisher=Applause Books |year=2005 |page=308}}</ref>\n\nFollowing Robin Williams' death, a re-appraisal of the film on [[RogerEbert.com]] stated that \"no Williams film can hit harder \u2014 or be so fully consoling in such heartbreaking circumstances \u2014 than ''The Fisher King''\", where his character \"gradually simmers to a boil of bristling insecurities, terror and agonizing internalized pain\".<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\nOn [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film has an approval rating of 84% based on 62 reviews, with an average rating of 7.1/10.
