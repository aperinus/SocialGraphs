Bill recovers her severed head and rushes to his country house basement laboratory. He and his crippled assistant Kurt revive the head in a liquid-filled tray. But Jan's new existence is agony, and she begs Bill to let her die. He ignores her pleas, and she grows to resent him.\n\nBill decides to commit murder to obtain a body for Jan. He hunts for a suitable specimen at a [[burlesque]] nightclub, on the streets, and at a beauty-contest. Jan begins communicating [[Telepathy|telepathically]] with a hideous mutant, an experiment gone wrong, locked in a laboratory cell. When Kurt leaves a hatch in the cell door unlocked, the monster grabs and tears off Kurt's arm. Kurt dies from his injuries.\n\nBill lures an old girlfriend, figure-model Doris Powell, to his house, promising to study her scarred face for plastic surgery. He drugs her and carries her to the laboratory. Jan protests Bill's plan to transplant her head onto Doris's body. He tapes Jan's mouth shut.\n\nWhen Bill goes to quiet the monster, it grabs Bill through the hatch and breaks the door from its hinges. Their struggles set the laboratory ablaze. The monster, a seven-foot giant with a horribly deformed head, bites a chunk from Bill's neck. Bill dies, and the monster carries the unconscious Doris to safety. As the lab goes up in flames, Jan says \"I told you to let me die\". The screen goes black, followed by Jan's maniacal cackle, welcoming her long awaited death.\n\n== Cast ==\n[[File:Brainthatwouldntdie.jpg|thumb|right|230px|[[Virginia Leith]] as Jan Compton.]]\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Jason Evers]] \u2013 Dr. Bill Cortner\n* [[Virginia Leith]] \u2013 Jan Compton\n* [[Bruce Brighton]] \u2013 Dr. Cortner senior (Bill's father)\n* [[Anthony La Penna]] \u2013 Kurt (Cortner's assistant) <small>(credited as [[Leslie Daniel]])</small>\n* [[Adele Lamont]] \u2013 Doris Powell\n* [[Bonnie Sharie]] \u2013 Blonde stripper\n* [[Paula Maurice]] \u2013 Brunette stripper\n* [[Marilyn Hanold]] \u2013 Peggy Howard\n* [[Arny Freeman]] \u2013 Photographer\n* [[Fred Martin (actor)|Fred Martin]] \u2013 Medical assistant\n* [[Lola Mason]] \u2013 Donna Williams\n* [[Doris Brent]] \u2013 Nurse\n* [[Bruce Kerr (actor)|Bruce Kerr]] \u2013 Beauty-contest M.C.\n* [[Audrey Devereau]] \u2013 Jeannie Reynolds\n* [[Eddie Carmel]] \u2013 Monster\n* [[Sammy Petrillo]] \u2013 Art <small>(uncredited)</small>\n}}\n{{Clear|right}}\n\n== Production ==\nThe film was shot independently around [[Tarrytown, New York]], in 1959 under the working title ''The Black Door''.<ref name=afi/> The title was later changed to ''The Head That Wouldn't Die''.<ref name=\"gary\">Gary A.
