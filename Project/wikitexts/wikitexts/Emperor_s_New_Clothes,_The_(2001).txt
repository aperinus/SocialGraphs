The film stars [[Ian Holm]] as [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] (his third performance as the military and political leader, after 1974's ''[[Napoleon and Love]]'' and 1981's ''[[Time Bandits]]''), [[Iben Hjejle]], and [[Tim McInnerny]]. The plot [[Secret history|revisions]] the history surrounding Napoleon's exile to [[Saint Helena]] following his defeat at the [[Battle of Waterloo]]. Although set in [[Paris]], the film was mostly shot in [[Turin]], Italy.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1821, [[Napoleon Bonaparte]], after six years in exile on the isle of [[Saint Helena]], has a plan to escape.  Switching places with lowly French deckhand Eugene Lenormand, Napoleon will make his way to [[Paris]], at which time Eugene will announce the switch, allowing Napoleon to reclaim his throne.\n\nHowever, the plan quickly goes awry: the ship Napoleon is serving on abruptly changes its itinerary and docks in [[Belgium]] instead of France. Having to make his way to France by land, and gaining an appalling look at the [[tourist trap]] the battlefield of [[Battle of Waterloo|Waterloo]] has become, he is finally met at the French border by a loyal agent, Sgt. Bommell, formerly of the [[Imperial Guard (Napoleon I)|Imperial Guard]].  Bommell gives him the name of another agent in Paris he can trust, Lt. Truchaut.\n\nArriving in Paris, Napoleon is surprised to find that Truchaut has recently died.  Passing himself off as an old comrade of the Lieutenant, Napoleon accepts the hospitality of Truchaut's widow, Nicole, whom everyone calls \"Pumpkin\", and makes the acquaintance of her other lodger, Dr. Lambert and her adopted young son, Gerard.\n\nThe crucial flaw in the plan reveals itself when, back on Saint Helena, Eugene decides he likes living in the relative luxury of Napoleon's exile, and refuses to reveal the switch. Napoleon's French entourage find themselves unexpectedly powerless, as Eugene stuffs his face with sweets, dictates his own bawdy version of Napoleon's official memoirs, and even manages to convince his British captors that he is the true Napoleon.\n\nWith no news from Saint Helena, Napoleon is drawn into Pumpkin's life. When her fruit-selling business is on the brink of failure, he applies his own talents for planning and organization, and the business becomes prosperous again.\n\nAs affection develops between Napoleon and Pumpkin, Dr Lambert, who had designs on Pumpkin himself, jealously searches for some kind of dirt on \"Eugene\". Going through his bedroom, Lambert is shocked to find a small [[Cameo (carving)|cameo]] portrait of Napoleon's [[Napoleon II|young son]], and realizes who \"Eugene\" really is.\n\nOn Saint Helena, Eugene abruptly drops dead of some kind of stomach complaint (in real-life, Napoleon reportedly died of [[Stomach cancer|gastric cancer]]). Realizing that the dead man on the island is not Napoleon, the British garrison commander lays out their options: either they announce the fraud, and face heinous punishment, or else maintain the illusion, and all will be well. \"Gentlemen\" he tells them \"what we have here is a dead emperor\".<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0282768/characters/nm0556609?ref_=tt_cl_t10  ''Quotes''] ''The Emperor's New Clothes'' at [[IMDb]]</ref>\n\nWhen \"Napoleon's\" death is announced throughout France, the real Napoleon abruptly remembers his original plan and announces to Pumpkin that it is time for him to take his rightful place on the French throne.  To his fury, Pumpkin is horrified and dismisses him as delusional, pleading that she loves Eugene, but hates Napoleon for taking her husband away.\n\nWith no loyalist agent in Paris to vouch for his identity, Napoleon finds himself an Emperor without an army, or a friend.  He is reduced to going to Dr Lambert, who he realizes stole the portrait, and demanding it back. When he demands to be told \"who I am\", Lambert retorts, \"I will show you.\"\n\nIn revenge for being beaten to Pumpkin's affections, Lambert lures him onto the grounds of a [[sanitorium]], where it seems every patient is dressed up as Napoleon, and pretending to be him.  Lambert withdraws, expecting him to be rounded up by the attendants, but a shaken Napoleon escapes the grounds by climbing over the wall, suffering a nasty cut on his hand from the [[chevaux de frise]] on top.\n\nEmotionally and physically exhausted, he returns home to Pumpkin's house. She lovingly tends his wounds, and whispers in his ear, \"you are my Napoleon.\"\n\nWhile Gerard is looking at a pictorial account of Napoleon's life on a [[magic lantern]], he tells the story of what really happened. It seems that Gerard, if no one else, believes his story.\n\nDeciding that he is happiest living a simple life with Pumpkin, Napoleon destroys all his mementos of his former life, except his old Imperial Guard uniform, which he leaves at the local military post as a gift for Sgt. Bommell, with a message that \"Eugene Lenormand has moved on.\"\n\nAn after-note states that Napoleon Bonaparte lived out the rest of his life in Paris and was buried next to Pumpkin; while Eugene Lenormand's body was brought back to Paris and interred with high honors in [[Les Invalides]].\n\n==Partial cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Ian Holm]] as [[Napoleon|Napoleon Bonaparte]] / Able Seaman Eugene Lenormand\n* [[Iben Hjejle]] as Nicole 'Pumpkin' Truchaut\n* [[Tim McInnerny]] as Dr Lambert\n* Tom Watson as Gerard\n* [[Nigel Terry]] as [[Charles Tristan, marquis de Montholon|Montholon]]\n* [[Hugh Bonneville]] as Bertrand\n* [[Murray Melvin]] as [[Fran\u00e7ois Carlo Antommarchi|Antommarchi]]\n* [[Eddie Marsan]] as [[Louis Joseph Marchand|Louis Marchand]]\n* [[Clive Russell]] as Sergeant Justin Bommel\n* [[Bob Mason (actor)|Bob Mason]] as Captain Nicholls\n* [[Trevor Cooper]] as Leaud\n* [[Niall O'Brien (actor)|Niall O'Brien]] as Bosun\n* [[Hayley Carmichael]] as Adele Raffin\n* [[Moya Brady]] as Woman\n* [[Philip McGough]] as English tourist\n* [[Tim Barlow]] as Bargee\n* [[Tony Vogel]] as British sergeant\n* [[Russell Tovey]] as Recruit\n* [[John McGlynn (actor)|John McGlynn]] as Gendarme\n}}\n\n==Reception==\n\nThe film received generally positive reception, holding a 73% \"fresh\" rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 85 reviews.\n\nIn June 2006, Simon Leys stated in the afterword of a new edition of ''Death of Napoleon'' that \"This latter avatar [''The Emperor's New Clothes''], by the way, was both sad and funny: sad, because Napoleon was interpreted to perfection by an actor ([[Ian Holm]]) whose performance made me dream of what could have been achieved had the producer and director bothered to read the book.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title = The Death of Napoleon|last = Leys|first = Simon|publisher = Black Inc|year = 2006|pages = 118|chapter = Author's Afterword}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{IMDb title|0282768}}\n*{{Rotten Tomatoes|emperors_new_clothes}}\n\n{{Ian Holm's Napoleon}}\n{{Alan Taylor}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Emperor's New Clothes}}\n[[Category:2001 films]]\n[[Category:2000s historical drama films]]\n[[Category:2001 drama films]]\n[[Category:British historical drama films]]\n[[Category:Depictions of Napoleon on film]]\n[[Category:Cultural depictions of Napoleon II]]\n[[Category:Film4 Productions films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Alan Taylor]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Rachel Portman]]\n[[Category:Films set in 1821]]\n[[Category:Films set in Paris]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Italy]]\n[[Category:Secret histories]]\n[[Category:2000s English-language films]]\n[[Category:2000s British films]]\n[[Category:2000s German films]]\n[[Category:2000s Italian films]]\n[[Category:German historical drama films]]\n[[Category:Italian historical drama films]]"}]}}}}
