Their teenage son comes home drunk one night, while the parents are away.  He apparently killed a man in a hit and run and said he hit a deer. The parents try to cover up.  Drina wants to call the police.  The father tries to stop her by bribing her with money but she refuses. The father kills her. The father solicits the aid of his son to bury Drina\u2019s corpse in the marshes of their property. Drina\u2019s friends show up at the house and demand to see her.  The father lies and says she left and that she also stole money. These friends know that this is a lie.  They keep on coming back, till one night the father shoots his own son, thinking it\u2019s one of the intruders.  The son dies ...and then jumps to a scene where the dad is looking out a window while his wife is sleeping{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}.
