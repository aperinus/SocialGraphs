The film was made through a partnership between Brazilian and Italian studios and starred [[Rodrigo Santoro]], [[Othon Bastos]] and [[Cassia Kiss]]. The film tells the story of Neto, a young man who is admitted to a [[psychiatric hospital]] after his father discovers he is a user of [[marijuana]]. There, Neto is subjected to abuse. In addition to abuse by psychiatric hospitals, the film deals with the issues of drugs and relationships between fathers and sons.\n\nBodanzky read Carrano's book in 1996 and, impressed by the theme, assigned [[Luiz Bolognesi]] to adapt it into a film and transpose its setting from the 1970s to the 1990s. In addition to keeping the film in the present, Bodanzky chose to make it a documentary-style film to create greater impact on the viewer. Bolognesi began writing in 1997 with the freedom to make changes to the original story. The film was shot in early 2000 in [[S\u00e3o Paulo]], and was edited and finalized in Italy.\n\n''Brainstorm'' had its premiere at the [[Rio Film Festival]] in October 2000. It subsequently received several awards and nominations both domestically and internationally; among them, Best Actor at the [[Cartagena Film Festival]], and Best Film at the [[Bras\u00edlia Film Festival]]. Domestic critical response was generally favorable and focused on the acting and its themes. Brazilian Film Critics Association selected it as one of the [[Abraccine Top 100 Brazilian films|best Brazilian films of all time]], while international critics were more mixed in their response.\n\n== Plot ==\nThe film opens as Mr. Wilson reads a letter he has received from his son Neto, in which Neto declares his contempt for his father. It is followed by a flashback to explain the story; Neto, a [[S\u00e3o Paulo]] middle-class teenager, has a troubled relationship with his father and his mother, Meire.\n\nOne day, Neto travels with his friend Lobo to [[Santos, S\u00e3o Paulo|Santos]] without informing his parents. They go to an apartment where they swim and eat food; Neto leaves the place when Lobo suggests that they reciprocate for the food by letting the men there caress them. Alone in downtown, Neto begs for money, and he is helped by a woman called Leninha. She takes him home to have lunch with some friends; after it, Neto and Leninha have sex. Later, at night, he is arrested for doing [[picha\u00e7\u00e3o|graffiti]], and his parents pick him up at the police station. The following day, Neto is in his bedroom and his father finds a [[marijuana cigarette]] in his jacket. Neto's sister advises his parents to send him to a mental institution.\n\nWilson tricks Neto and brings him to a hospital where he is forcibly admitted without any examination to verify its necessity. Neto is sedated by a nurse before receiving the diagnosis of Dr. Cintra. When he wakes up, Neto encounters Cear\u00e1, a hyperactive man, and finds out the hospital is decaying and careless. He also meets Rog\u00e9rio, an injectable drug user committed by his family, who tells him it is impossible to escape and that if he were to try he would be drugged with [[haloperidol]] or electrocuted. Rog\u00e9rio also tells him not to consume the medications administered by nurses because it awakes the appetite in order to make patients look healthier. Meanwhile, Cintra has a conversation in which he discusses that if necessary he could easily admit more people, mostly homeless, to avoid losing the government subsidy.\n\nAfter some time, Neto's parents and sister visit him, and are deceived by the doctor who says Neto requires months of treatment. Neto begs his parents to take him with them and they refuse. Days later, Neto tries to escape but is captured and receives electroshock treatment. Suddenly, on another day, his father visits him to say he and Meire miss him; Neto asks to leave the place and Wilson takes him away. At home, his mother asks a downcast Neto if he wants to return to school or to work as a salesman; he decides to work. The mother of one of his friends forbids Neto to see him, and he discovers Leninha is a married woman. Then, he becomes distressed to the point of leaving a client in the midst of a sale. To unwind, Neto goes to a party at night, where he mixes [[Coca-Cola]] and [[cacha\u00e7a]]. Drunk, he carries his friend Bel to the bathroom and they start to kiss each other. However, he goes berserk and starts to damage the place. The police are called and send him to another psychiatric hospital.\n\nIn this new institution, Neto angers the nurse Ivan after reporting to the hospital's superior that the nurse overreacted while trying to calm a patient. The nurse has it out for him, and when Ivan sees Neto faking to take a pill, he injects the drug through a syringe. That night, Neto, after doping a nurse, goes to the hospital stockroom and asks the inmate Biu{{refn|group=note|In the credits of ''Brainstorm'', Marcos Cesana's character is credited as \"Biu\"; however, in the book about the production of the film and in the film's official website he is mentioned as \"Bil.\"{{sfn|Bolognesi|Bodanzky|2002|p=8}}<ref name=cast>{{cite web | url=http://bichodesetecabecas.com.br/ingles/elenco/index.htm | title=Cast \u2013 actors | publisher=Brainstorm official website | access-date=October 25, 2014 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304043122/http://bichodesetecabecas.com.br/ingles/elenco/index.htm | archive-date=March 4, 2016 | url-status=dead }}</ref>}} to set fire to a stack of drugs. When Ivan discovers this, Neto receives [[solitary confinement]]. After being released from solitary, Neto writes a letter to his father and silently gives it to him when he visits. After refusing to have his hair cut, Neto is locked in solitary once again. He sets fires to the cage and is rescued by the nurses. After reading the letter, Wilson takes him from the clinic. The films ends as Wilson cries while he and Neto are seen seated side-by-side on a curbside.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Rodrigo Santoro]] as Neto\n* [[Othon Bastos]] as Mr. Wilson\n* [[C\u00e1ssia Kiss]]  as Meire, Neto's mother\n* Daniela Nefussi as Neto's sister\n* Jairo Mattos as Nurse Ivan\n* Altair Lima as Dr. Cintra Ara\u00fajo\n* [[Caco Ciocler]] as Rog\u00e9rio\n* Linneu Dias as Jornalista\n* [[Gero Camilo]] as Cear\u00e1\n\n== Production ==\nLa\u00eds Bodanzky read the autobiographical book ''Canto dos Malditos'' by {{illm|Austreg\u00e9silo Carrano Bueno|pt}} for the first time in 1996,{{Sfn|Bolognesi|Bodanzky|2002|p=7}} when she was signed to assist with the direction of a documentary on the subject.<ref name=istoe28 /> She found the book after entering a discussion and research group on mental health in Brazil.{{Sfn|Bolognesi|Bodanzky|2002|p=7}}<ref name=estadao>{{cite web | url=http://cultura.estadao.com.br/noticias/cinema,filme-mostra-viagem-ao-inferno-dos-manicomios,20010103p1326 | title=Filme mostra viagem ao inferno dos manic\u00f4mios | date=January 3, 2001 | work=[[O Estado de S.

Making it a story of love and hate, Bolognesi decided to explore another theme he considered a taboo: the father-son relationship. He based the atmosphere of the relation on [[Franz Kafka]]'s [[Letter to His Father]]. He used words from a letter by [[Lupic\u00ednio Rodrigues]] to a woman to open the film, as he wanted its feelings to guide the story.{{sfn|Bolognesi|Bodanzky|2002|p=12\u201313}}\n\nBodanzky considered the screenplay a key element of the production of ''Brainstorm''; it was her only way of attracting a good cast and staff because it was her first feature film.{{Sfn|Bolognesi|Bodanzky|2002|p=7}} It aroused the interest of lead actors Santoro, Bastos, Kiss, and the producers Sara Silveira, Caio and Fabiano Gullane.{{Sfn|Bolognesi|Bodanzky|2002|p=8}} [[Marco Muller]], Italian producer of Fabrica Cinema, was also lured by the script, and the film became a Brazil-Italy co-production.{{Sfn|Bolognesi|Bodanzky|2002|p=8}}<ref>{{cite web | url=http://revistacult.uol.com.br/home/2011/10/mostra-bodanzky/ | title=\"Bicho de Sete Cabe\u00e7as\" come\u00e7ou na Mostra de SP | work=Revista Cult | publisher=[[Universo Online]] | date=October 2011 | access-date=October 25, 2014 | language=pt | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141026052229/http://revistacult.uol.com.br/home/2011/10/mostra-bodanzky/ | archive-date=2014-10-26 | url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n=== Casting and cast preparation ===\n[[File:Rodrigo Santoro.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Bodanzky's first choice for the main role,<ref name=santoro /> Santoro debuted in film with ''Brainstorm''.<ref name=cast />]]\nSantoro was recommended by [[Paulo Autran]], who acted along with him in the TV series ''Hilda Furac\u00e3o''.
