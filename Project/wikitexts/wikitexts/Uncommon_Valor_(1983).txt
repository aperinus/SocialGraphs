Hackman plays a former [[U.S. Marine]] colonel who puts together a rag-tag team to rescue his son, who he believes is among [[prisoner of war#Post-World War II|those still held]] in [[Laos]] after the [[Vietnam War]].\n\n==Plot==\nIn the early 1980s, retired [[United States Marine Corps|Marine]] Colonel Jason Rhodes is obsessed with finding his son Frank, an Army Lieutenant listed as \"[[Vietnam War POW/MIA issue|missing in action]]\" since 1972. After 10 years of searching [[Southeast Asia]] and turning up several leads, Rhodes believes that Frank is still alive and being kept in [[Laos]] as a prisoner of war.\n\nAfter petitioning the United States government for help, but receiving none, Colonel Rhodes brings together a disparate group of [[Vietnam War]] veterans, including some who were a part of Frank's platoon:  Wilkes, a \"[[tunnel rat]]\" who suffers from [[PTSD]]; \"Blaster\", a demolitions expert; and \"Sailor\", a crazed yet loyal machine gunner. Additionally, two helicopter pilot acquaintances of Rhodes, [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United States)|Distinguished Flying Cross]] recipient Johnson and Charts, join the group. Former [[United States Marine Corps Force Reconnaissance|Force Recon Marine]] Kevin Scott joins the team and later turns out to be the son of a pilot who was shot down in Vietnam and listed as MIA.\n\nWith the financial backing of good friend and rich oil businessman McGregor, whose son served in Frank's platoon and is also listed among the missing, the men train near [[Galveston, Texas]] in preparation to undertake a rescue mission at a remote POW camp in Laos. As the team arrives in Southeast Asia, the [[CIA]], fearing an international crisis from Rhodes' actions, intercepts him in [[Bangkok]] and confiscates his weapons and equipment. Still determined to rescue their comrades, the team members put together their expense money given to them by McGregor to purchase replacement weapons and supplies. Rhodes contacts an acquaintance, deposed local drug baron Jiang, who joins the expedition with his two daughters Lai Fun and Mai Lin. Jiang manages to supply them with outdated but capable [[World War II]]-era weapons. In the course of the expedition, Charts gradually forms a relationship with Lai Fun.\n\nNear the Laotian border, the group is attacked by a border patrol unit and Mai Lin is killed. Later, the group divides: Rhodes leads Charts, Sailor, Johnson and Lai Fun as the \"air team\" to a helicopter compound to secure escape transportation, while Jiang, Blaster, Scott and Wilkes scout out the prison camp as the \"ground team.\"  The ground team later discovers four Americans among the prisoners, but are unable to ascertain Frank's whereabouts.\n\nThe teams spend the night preparing before commencing the attack the next morning. Blaster sets up demolition charges, while Rhodes and his team discover that the air base is not where they expected it to be. Hiking through the jungle, they find it, get the choppers and take off, but are late in arriving at the camp. Blaster makes the decision to blow his charges to prevent the prisoners from leaving the camp, even though the choppers haven't arrived. In a heated battle, they manage to spring the prisoners, among them McGregor's son, but Frank is not among them; Blaster, Sailor and Jiang are killed in the process. From McGregor's son, Rhodes learns that Frank became ill soon after his capture and died. It is revealed that Frank was the soldier who stopped to carry a wounded McGregor during the platoon's evacuation to the helicopters in Vietnam in 1972 (as seen in the opening scene), but they were left behind as the helicopter carrying Blaster, Sailor and Wilkes departed the hot landing zone.\n\nStateside, the group is joyously welcomed by their families with media attention and fanfare. Rhodes finds that in learning the fate of his son, he has gained some closure for his wife and himself.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Gene Hackman]] as Colonel Jason Rhodes [[United States Marine Corps|USMC]] (Ret.)\n* [[Robert Stack]] as Harry MacGregor\n* [[Fred Ward]] as Wilkes\n* [[Reb Brown]] as 'Blaster'\n* [[Randall \"Tex\" Cobb]] as 'Sailor'\n* [[Patrick Swayze]] as Kevin Scott\n* [[Harold Sylvester]] as Johnson\n* [[Tim Thomerson]] as 'Charts'\n* [[Charles Aidman]] as Senator Hastings\n* James Edgcomb as CIA Agent\n* [[Jan Triska]] as Gericault\n* Jerry Kemp as Ferryman\n* [[Tad Horino]] as Mr. Ky\n* [[Kwan Hi Lim]] as Jiang\n* Lau Nga Lai as Lai Fun\n* Debi Parker as Mai Ling\n* [[Gail Strickland]] as Helen Rhodes\n* [[Jane Kaczmarek]] as Mrs. Wilkes\n* [[Gloria Stroock]] as Mrs. MacGregor\n* [[Constance Forslund]] as Mrs. 'Charts'\n* Todd Allen<!-- not the comedian --> as Frank Rhodes\n* Steve Solberg as POW #1\n* Laurence Neber as POW #2\n* [[Don Mantooth]] as POW #3\n* [[Michael Dudikoff]] as Blaster's Assistant\n* [[Barret Oliver]] as Kid #2\n}}\n\n==Production==\nThe film began with a screenplay by actor [[Wings Hauser]], who says he was inspired by the stories of a childhood friend, Gary Dickerson, who had been to Vietnam. \"I saw that he had left something behind in Viet Nam and that triggered the whole thing,\" said Hauser. \"And then I became aware of the MIA and the POW situation and said well that will be the excuse to go back to Nam \nand gel the POWs, but what they\u2019re really going back for is their own clarity and their own integrity right? And that\u2019s the story. That\u2019s the whole film.\"<ref name=\"video\"/>\n\nHauser says it took a 18 months to write the script<ref name=\"video\"/> which he sold to Paramount. The film had at least five title changes, including ''Last River to Cross''.<ref>{{cite news |first=Lou |last=Cedrone |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=892&dat=19831223&id=oaRaAAAAIBAJ&pg=4200,4854391 |date=23 December 1983 |newspaper=[[The Baltimore Evening Sun]] |via=[[The Daily Courier (Arizona)|The Daily Courier]] |title=Valor not common but highly unlikely}}</ref>\n\nJohn Milius became attached to the producer. The script was rewritten by Joe Gayton. Hauser lost credit in arbitration. In 1989, the actor-writer said, \"John Milius is a scumbag right-wing bastard and I can\u2019t wait for his day to die! That son of a bitch! The (other) guy who got the credit, he was a punk! I don\u2019t think he\u2019s sold anything since and I have and he\u2019s a joke!\"<ref name=\"video\">{{cite magazine|magazine=Psychotronic Video|page=[https://archive.org/details/Psychotronic_Video_03/page/n52 51]|url=https://archive.org/details/Psychotronic_Video_03|first=Char|last=Rao|title=Wings Hauser|number=3|date=Summer 1989}}</ref>\n\nParamount sent Joe Gayton's script to director Ted Kotcheff late in January, 1983. The following month it came out that James Gritz (aka [[Bo Gritz]]), a former lieutenant-colonel in the Green Berets (and the man that both the characters [[Rambo (franchise)|Rambo]] and Hannibal Smith from ''[[The A-Team]]'' are based upon), had led a secret mission into Laos the previous November to search for MIA American soldiers which ended when they were ambushed by Laotian soldiers. Kotcheff said \"We assiduously avoided anything in our story similar to Gritz. Our research amazingly showed there were some 30 groups training for similar missions.\"<ref name=\"new\"/>\n\nKotcheff said that Milius did write \"two or three scenes\" as well as making \"a number of very creative suggestions\" on the script. Among the scenes Milius wrote included one where Hackman gives a speech to the other soldiers about Vietnam being like a company that has gone bankrupt. \"It was a wonderful speech,\" said Kotcheff, adding Milius \"did write under pressure but mainly he functioned as a producer.\"<ref>{{cite book|page=[https://archive.org/details/filmdirectorsond00gall/page/156 156]|title=Film directors on directing|url=https://archive.org/details/filmdirectorsond00gall|url-access=registration|last=Gallagher|first= John|year=1989 |publisher=Praeger}}</ref>\n\nMilius said he wanted [[James Arness]] to play the lead role rather than Gene Hackman.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://thenewbev.com/tarantinos-reviews/tarantino-on-milius-1982/|first=Quentin|last=Tarantino|title=Tarantino on Milius|website=The New Beverly Cinema|date=11 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Filming===\nFilming started June 6, 1983. The Laotian [[POW]] camp that forms the climax of the film was built on a private ranch in the Lumahai Valley on the island of [[Kauai, Hawaii]], and was filmed in early August, 1983.   The opening scene depicting the [[Vietnam War]] was filmed a short distance away in a [[rice paddy]], two miles from central [[Hanalei, Hawaii]], and 200 yards from the Kuhio Highway.   Additional parts of the film were shot in [[Salt Lake City]], [[Utah]], [[Sun Valley, California]], and [[Castaic, California]] (which served as the training camp).<ref>{{cite book|last1=D'Arc|first1=James V.|title=When Hollywood came to town: a history of moviemaking in Utah|date=2010|publisher=Gibbs Smith|location=Layton, Utah|isbn=9781423605874|edition=1st}}</ref>\n\nThe helicopters used in the film were purchased (as opposed to rented) and repainted, since the [[United States Department of Defense]] was unwilling to rent the production military-spec [[Bell UH-1N]] Huey or [[Bell 206B]] Jet Ranger helicopters due to the apparent \"anti-government\" nature of the film.{{citation needed|reason=The \"due to\" claim needs some support.|date=March 2019}}\n\nMilius hired a composer without Paramount's consent and Jeffrey Katzenberg over-ruled Milius.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/02/07/magazine/who-makes-disney-run.html |title=Who Makes Disney Run? |first=Aljean |last=Harmetz |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=7 February 1988 |page=A.29}}</ref>\n\n==Marketing==\nParamount had originally prepared an advertising campaign that was \"factual and rather somber and centred on the plight of prisoners of war\", according to one report.<ref name=\"new\"/> However after the marketing department saw the film they decided to create an entirely new campaign. The poster showed a soldier (McGregor's son) being carried by another soldier (Sailor) with the copy line, \"C'mon, buddy, we're going home.\" (An incorrect depiction from the opening scene where Frank, not Sailor, actually carries McGregor's son during the battle). \"We were looking to appeal to males on an emotional level,\" said Paramount's head of marketing, Gordon Weaver. \"We were offering them an attainable fantasy. We'd all like to think that we can be heroes, that we would leave our jobs and families to do something really terrific for our friends.\"<ref name=\"new\"/>\n\n==Reception==\n===Box Office===\nThe film was a box-office hit, one of the top-earning films of 1983.<ref name=\"new\">{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1755&dat=19840215&id=ZroeAAAAIBAJ&sjid=vGgEAAAAIBAJ&pg=4384,5249915 |title='Uncommon Valor' An Uncommon Hit |newspaper=[[Sarasota Herald-Tribune]] |via=[[Google News Archive]] |agency=[[New York Times News Service]] |date=15 February 1984 |page=8-C}}</ref> This was considered a surprise at the time because of the film's lack of stars and the fact it had to compete with ''[[Scarface (1983 film)|Scarface]]'' and ''[[Sudden Impact]]''. Gordon Weaver, Paramount's president of marketing, thought the film \"was successful because of the emotional impact of the ending. The emotional ending really makes you feel terrific.\"<ref name=\"new\"/>\n\nKotcheff said \"If we knew the secret of a film's success, we'd all be very wealthy. But I think it's partly the strong emotional tug of the father-son relationship.\"<ref name=\"new\"/>\n\n===Critical response===\nCritical reception of the film was mixed, with a 60% rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on reviews from 10 critics.<ref>{{Rotten Tomatoes |id=m/1022314_uncommon_valor}}</ref>\n\n[[Gene Siskel]] and [[Roger Ebert]] of ''[[At the Movies with Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert|This Week at the Movies: The Movie Review Program]]'' both gave the film a [[Thumbs signal|thumbs down]].<ref>{{cite journal |title=This Time We Win - Vietnam Movie Special (ATM 1985) |journal=This Week at the Movies: The Movie Review Program |authors=Gene Siskel and Robert Ebert |url=http://siskelandebert.org/video/UO49DS1OGU4W/This-Time-We-Win--Vietnam-Movie-Special-ATM-1985 |date=1985 |access-date=28 May 2013 |archive-url=https://archive.today/45kj6 |archive-date=5 July 2013}}</ref> In his ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' review of ''Uncommon Valor'', Ebert gave the film a mixed 2-out-of-4 star review that described the squandering of \"first-rate talent\" like Kotcheff and Hackman in a film that was little more than \"two hours of clich\u00e9s\" delivered with \"lead-footed predictability\".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/uncommon-valor-1983 |title=Uncommon Valor Movie Review & Film Summary (1983) |author-link=Roger Ebert |first=Roger |last=Ebert |website= [[Chicago Sun-Times]] }}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Joint POW/MIA Accounting Command]]\n* [[Vietnam War POW/MIA issue]]\n* [[National League of Families]]\n* [[Operation Homecoming]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{IMDb title|id=0086508}}\n*{{Amg movie|51698}}\n*{{rotten-tomatoes|1022314-uncommon_valor}}\n*{{Mojo title|uncommonvalor}}\n\n{{Ted Kotcheff}}\n\n[[Category:1983 films]]\n[[Category:Vietnam War films]]\n[[Category:1980s action war films]]\n[[Category:American war adventure films]]\n[[Category:American action war films]]\n[[Category:American action adventure films]]\n[[Category:Paramount Pictures films]]\n[[Category:Films set in Houston]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Ted Kotcheff]]\n[[Category:Vietnam War POW/MIA issues]]\n[[Category:Films about the United States Marine Corps]]\n[[Category:Films scored by James Horner]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Utah]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Hawaii]]\n[[Category:Films produced by Buzz Feitshans]]\n[[Category:1980s English-language films]]\n[[Category:1980s American films]]"}]}}}}
