It centers on a young racing driver's effort to win the [[Championship Auto Racing Teams|CART FedEx Championship Series]] auto racing championship. Prior to production, Stallone was seen at many [[Formula One]] races, but he was unable to procure enough information about the category due to the secrecy with which teams protect their cars, so he decided to base the film on Champ Car.\n\n''Driven'' received generally negative reviews from critics, and was a commercial failure.\n\n==Plot==\n{{Long plot|date=September 2021}}\nHalfway through the fictionalized [[2000 CART World Series Season|2000 Champ Car Season]], rookie driver Jimmy Bly has already won five races. His brother/business manager Demille seems more concerned with working out endorsement deals and press engagements than racing, putting tremendous pressure upon Jimmy. His success has also drawn the ire of the reigning champion and series points leader Beau Brandenburg, who believes he's not doing as well as he should because of his fianc\u00e9e Sophia becoming \"a distraction\". Brandenburg breaks up their engagement and he regains his winning streak at [[Chicago Motor Speedway]].\n\nAs Brandenburg returns to form, Jimmy's [[paraplegic]] team owner Carl Henry is concerned that he is making more driving errors. He sees parallels to his former driver and Champ Car Champion, Joe Tanto, whom he convinces to come out of retirement to mentor Jimmy. Joe agrees and is brought in to replace Jimmy's teammate, Memo Moreno. To complicate matters, Joe's ex-wife Cathy Heguy is now married to Memo, the driver that Joe replaced. Despite all this, Joe and Memo are still friends. Demille takes a dislike to Joe's mentoring, implying that Joe should just act as a blocker.\n\nJoe's comeback race in [[Canada]] is extremely close, with Jimmy leading and Brandenburg a close second. Jimmy can't seem to pull away from him, so Carl orders Joe to pit and holds him there until the leaders are about to come by, despite Joe's protests. At the last second, Joe leaves the pit just in time to block out Brandenburg, allowing Jimmy to win the race. At the same time, Jimmy starts to form a bond with Sophia, and they start hanging out together; their bond grows further when they travel to [[Japan]], where the next race is held. Joe urges Brandenburg to reconcile with Sophia, while Jimmy's growing bond with Sophia causes him to further lose his form on the track during the next race and results in him crashing out.\n\nAt a party in [[Chicago]], where the prototypes of next year's cars are being introduced, Brandenburg and Sophia reconcile, much to Jimmy's disappointment. Sophia apologizes to Jimmy, but he angrily lashes out at her and Brandenburg, then takes one of the new cars and races it out of the convention center. Joe hops into another of the new cars and chases Jimmy down the streets of Chicago, eventually calming him down and bringing him back to his senses after they stop driving. In the coming race in [[Germany]], Carl decides that bringing back Joe isn't getting the results he wants, so he reinstates Memo while making Joe mentor Jimmy from the pit lane.\n\nThe next race begins in the middle of the rain, with Jimmy and Brandenburg once again fighting it out for first. Jimmy needs one more win to take the championship, and Memo is instructed to block for him and keep out of his way. However, Cathy convinces Memo to go for the win, and as a result, he collides with Jimmy in a horrific crash that sends him flying into a lake on the far end of the course. Jimmy and Brandenburg dive into the lake and rescue Memo just as a burning tree collapses onto the burning car and ignites the leaking fuel, causing an explosion. This event causes Brandenburg to warm up to Jimmy, telling him he's a good man.\n\nCarl, angered by Jimmy's decision to rescue Moreno instead of fighting on for the championship, decides to replace him with Brandenburg for the coming season and negotiates a deal with Demille, who will now represent Brandenburg. Demille tries to get Brandenburg to sign the new contract, but Brandenburg refuses the deal; Sophia punches Demille in the face for the way he treated her previously. Initially, Jimmy is barred from competing due to a foot injury he sustained during the rescue, but Carl finally decides to clear him for the race after he passes Carl's strength test, and Jimmy thanks both Sophia and Brandenburg for refusing his brother's deal.\n\nAt the final race of the year in [[Detroit]], Jimmy and Brandenburg are contenders for the championship. With Memo now hospitalized, Joe is racing again as Jimmy's teammate. In the final laps, Joe takes the lead but damages his front suspension by avoiding a crash. He can no longer contend for the win and the two leaders pass him on the final lap. Jimmy starts to have a mental lapse, but upon hearing Joe's words of wisdom, he pulls ahead of Brandenburg by just a few inches, while Joe's spinning car crosses in third. In front of a large crowd of spectators, including Sophia and Demille, who finally shows he is proud of his brother, Jimmy is named the new champion and he celebrates his victory with Joe and Brandenburg.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Sylvester Stallone]] as Joe \"The Hummer\" Tanto, a veteran Champ Car champion who comes out of retirement to train Jimmy\n* [[Burt Reynolds]] as Carl Henry\n* [[Kip Pardue]] as Jimmy Bly, a rookie Champ Car driver \n* [[Til Schweiger]] as Beau Brandenburg, reigning Champ Car champion and Jimmy's rival\n* [[Gina Gershon]] as Cathy Heguy Moreno, Memo's wife\n* [[Estella Warren]] as Sophia Simone, Beau's ex-girlfriend\n* [[Cristi\u00e1n de la Fuente]] as Memo Moreno, Jimmy's racing partner\n* [[Stacy Edwards]] as Lucretia \"Luc\" Clan\n* [[Robert Sean Leonard]] as Demille Bly\n* [[Brent Briscoe]] as \"Crusher\"\n* [[Renny Harlin]] as Replacement Driver\n* Frank Blanch as Bill\n* Barry Stillwell as Bob\n* [[Verona Pooth]] as Nina\n* [[Jasmin Wagner]] as Ingrid\n* [[Alison Armitage]] as Girlfriend (uncredited)\n;Cameo appearances\n* [[Mario Andretti]] as Himself\n* [[Jacques Villeneuve]] as Himself\n* [[Juan Pablo Montoya]] as Himself\n* [[Adrian Fernandez]] as Himself\n* [[Mark Blundell]] as Himself\n* [[Roberto Moreno]] as Himself\n* [[Kenny Br\u00e4ck]] as Himself\n* [[Tony Kanaan]] as Himself\n* [[Maur\u00edcio Gugelmin]] as Himself\n* [[Max Papis]] as Himself\n* [[Paul Tracy]] as Himself\n* [[Dario Franchitti]] as Himself\n* [[Michel Jourdain Jr.]] as Himself (deleted scene)\n}}\n\nMontoya, Gugelmin, and Blundell lent their car and helmet likeness to Brandenburg, Tanto and Bly respectively, Blundell's helmet being suitably changed from an \"MB\" logo to \"JB\".

However, the plan was subsequently dropped.\n\nStallone said he wrote about twenty-five drafts.\n<blockquote>And of those, about 20 were about this one man's journey, myself, through this film, and all his trials and tribulations. He'd fallen from a great height career-wise. He was a drunkard with all these problems and accidents because he and his wife Cathy, who's played by Gina Gershon, had this very tumultuous relationship. (Laughs) I'm giving you a little biographical hint here. And he just started to come apart. So he was brought back as kind of like how people should never be. It's like taking kids who are truants and then taking them to prison to see where they'll end up and scaring them straight. So I was brought back to basically prove to young Jimmy Bly how he should never be, as a bad example. And then the more we worked on it, it became the dark side, a little seedy, and I didn't know where the upside of it was ever going to be. So we began to reduce his role and make it more of an ensemble, so he's just there as a guy who did his job, wasn't very spectacular, would race like hell, sometimes he'd win, sometimes lose, but he had a certain work ethic code, that old school that could be applied to Jimmy. So that all made it more ensemble, and then in the editing we reduced it even more. I originally had a relationship going with the reporter. But that began to de-emphasise the other people, so we put that on the back burner... So we did shoot it but it we said, \"Nah, it's not really flying.\"<ref name=\"cinema\">{{cite web|url=http://cinema.com/articles/340/driven-interview-with-sylvester-stallone.phtml|title=Driven : Interview With Sylvester Stallone}}</ref></blockquote>\nStallone said the film was autobiographical in a lot of ways.\n<blockquote>Racing's very much like the world of acting. You have your front runners and you have guys that are there for the long race, and you have other guys that block for other people, that are called supporting and character actors. It's all the same kind of situation. And you realize that you can't always be No. 1. You just can't be the guy in front all the time. So what you can do is lend support to, and help and nourish and encourage someone else. So it's like your experiences live on in someone else. If you can find some young actor and you can say, 'Listen, don't do this and don't do that and avoid this and that,' and share your experiences, and he does succeed, you can say, 'You know what, I kind of contributed to that.' As an actor did you have to learn you can't always be No.1 the hard way?
