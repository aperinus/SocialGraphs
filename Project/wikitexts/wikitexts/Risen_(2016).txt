The film stars [[Joseph Fiennes]], [[Tom Felton]], [[Peter Firth]], and [[Cliff Curtis]], and details a Roman soldier's search for [[Jesus|Yeshua]]'s body following his [[Resurrection of Jesus|resurrection]]. [[Columbia Pictures]] released the film to theaters in the United States on  February 19, 2016. It received mixed reviews and grossed $46 million worldwide.\n\n== Plot ==\nAfter crushing a small scale [[Zealots|Zealot]] revolt led by [[Barabbas]], Clavius, a [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] [[Military tribune|Tribune]], is sent by [[Pontius Pilate]] to expedite a crucifixion already in progress. Three days later he is appointed to investigate the rumors of a risen Jewish [[Messiah]]. Pilate orders him to locate the missing body of [[Jesus|Yeshua]], one of the crucified men. In doing so, Pilate seeks to quell an imminent uprising in [[Jerusalem]] before the Emperor arrives.<ref name=\"THR 1\">{{cite news|last1=Kit|first1=Borys|title='Hatfields & McCoys' Director Tackling Jesus in 'Resurrection'|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/hatfields-mccoys-director-tackling-jesus-639133|access-date=May 1, 2015|publisher=Hollywood Reporter|date=September 30, 2013}}</ref> Failing to secure Yeshua's body, Clavius, with the support of his loyal aide Lucius, attempts to locate and question the disciples of Yeshua and those involved in his crucifixion and burial for clues to his disappearance.\n\nNumerous leads are dug up, and their accounts soon become increasingly miraculous and difficult to believe. Some of the followers, such as [[Mary Magdalene]] and a man named [[Bartholomew the Apostle|Bartholomew]], seemingly speak only in riddles and refuse to betray any others. Clavius' intense investigation begins to disturb both Romans and Hebrews alike, and Pilate, under pressure from many sides and fearful of [[Tiberius|Caesar]]'s wrath, becomes increasingly distant and unsupportive. Running out of new leads, Clavius revisits a disgraced Roman soldier, assigned to guard Yeshua's cave tomb, now a drunkard, and vehemently shakes the drunken man out of a lie that he had previously stuck to. The soldier recounts a fantastic story that, on the morning Yeshua disappeared, a blinding flash had appeared, during which the stone and ropes sealing the tomb disintegrated, and a figure appeared, accompanied by a booming voice that sent him and a fellow soldier fleeing in fear. Clavius does not believe him.\n\nDuring a raid through a Jewish enclave, Clavius unexpectedly discovers a seemingly resurrected Yeshua with his apostles in a solitary abode. Stunned, he calls off the search, barring Lucius and his men from finding Yeshua and the apostles. That night, another Roman raid, led by Lucius and Pilate, attacks the building that Clavius had forbidden them from entering, and finds it empty, save a note from Clavius, who has decided to continue the investigation on his own. Having abandoned [[Roman polytheism]] and the god [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]], Clavius, at first distrustful of the group, soon joins Yeshua and his followers on a journey to determine the validity of his mortal rejuvenation, during which he talks to and befriends both Yeshua and the apostle Peter.\n\nPilate deduces that Clavius has apparently betrayed him, and dispatches a contingent of Roman troops, led by a promoted Lucius, to pursue him and Yeshua. Clavius assists the disciples in evading the Roman search party, and, when caught personally by Lucius, Clavius disarms him, then convinces him to let them pass quietly. Consequently, Clavius witnesses Yeshua's miraculous healing of a leper, and then the [[Ascension of Jesus|ascension of Yeshua]] into Heaven; after which the Apostles split up to resume their journeys, and Clavius bids farewell to Peter. Later, communicating his travels to a stranger in a remote dwelling, Clavius acknowledges the strangeness of the tale and its veracity, feeling he will never be the same.\n\n== Cast ==\n[[File:Joseph Fiennes 2.jpg|thumb|upright|265px|right|Actor Joseph Fiennes, who portrayed Roman Tribune Clavius.]]\n<!-- star billing -->\n* [[Joseph Fiennes]] as Clavius Aquila Valerius Niger\n* [[Tom Felton]] as Lucius Tyco Ennius\n* [[Peter Firth]] as [[Pontius Pilate]]\n* [[Cliff Curtis]] as [[Jesus|Yeshua]] the [[Messiah]]\n* [[Mar\u00eda Botto]] as [[Mary Magdalene]]\n* [[Luis Callejo]] as [[Brothers of Jesus|Joses]]\n* [[Antonio Gil]] as [[Joseph of Arimathea]]\n* [[Stephen Greif]] as [[Caiaphas]]\n* Richard Atwill as Polybius\n* Stewart Scudamore as [[Saint Peter|Peter]]\n* Andy Gathergood as Quintus\n* Stephen Hagan as [[Bartholomew]]\n* Mish Boyko as [[John the Apostle|John]]\n* Jan Cornet as [[Thomas the Apostle|Thomas]]\n* Joe Manj\u00f3n as [[Simon the Canaanite]]\n* Pepe Lorente as [[Jude the Apostle|Thaddeus]]\n* Stavros Demetraki as [[Philip the Apostle|Philip]]\n* [[Selva Rasalingam]] as [[James, brother of Jesus|James]]\n* Manu Fullola as [[Matthew the Apostle|Matthew]]\n* Mario Tardon as [[Andrew the Apostle|Andrew]]\n* Paco Manzanedo as Centurion\n* Karim Saleh as [[Barabbas]]\n\n== Production ==\nThe film was shot in [[Malta]] and [[Spain]] between August and November 2015.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.independent.com.mt/articles/2016-02-20/local-news/Filmed-in-Malta-Risen-tells-resurrection-tale-through-a-sceptic-6736153649|title=Filmed in Malta: 'Risen' tells resurrection tale through a sceptic|date=February 20, 2016|website=The Malta Independent|access-date=April 18, 2016}}</ref>\n\n== Release ==\nThe film held its world premiere on February 15, 2016, at the Highland Park Village Theatre in [[Dallas|Dallas, Texas]].<ref>[http://www.parkcitiespeople.com/community/hp-village-gets-dose-of-holywood/ HP Village Gets Dose of Hollywood] Park Cities People, February 15, 2016</ref> [[Columbia Pictures]] then released it in the United States on February 19, 2016.<ref>{{cite news|title=The Trailer for Risen, Starring Joseph Fiennes and Tom Felton|url=https://www.comingsoon.net/movies/trailers/435359-the-trailer-for-risen-starring-joseph-fiennes-and-tom-felton|access-date=May 1, 2015|work=comingsoon.net|date=April 29, 2015}}</ref>\n\n=== Home media ===\n''Risen'' was released on digital media on May 10, 2016, and was followed by a [[DVD]], [[Blu-ray]] and [[Blu-ray#Ultra HD Blu-ray|4K Ultra HD]] release on May 24, 2016, from AFFIRM Films and Sony Pictures Home Entertainment.<ref>{{cite news|title=RISEN Debuts on Digital and More in May|url=http://religionnews.com/2016/04/25/risen-debuts-on-digital-and-more-in-may/|access-date=June 6, 2016|work=Religion News Service|date=April 25, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=May 24: This Week on Blu-ray, DVD and Digital HD|url=https://www.comingsoon.net/dvd/features/689547-may-24-blu-ray-dvd-digital-hd#/slide/1|author=Silas Lesnick|access-date=June 6, 2016|work=Comingsoon.net|date=May 24, 2016}}</ref> The film debuted in second place on home video sales charts behind ''Deadpool'' for the week ending May 29, 2016.<ref>{{cite news|title=\u2018Deadpool\u2019 Marks Third Week Atop Home-Video Charts|url=https://variety.com/2016/digital/news/deadpool-marks-third-week-atop-home-video-charts-1201787100/|author=Thomas K.
