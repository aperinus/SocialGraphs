His family has moved from Chicago after the suicide of eldest son Allen, a loss that continues to haunt Steve. On his first day at the local high school, Steve befriends three outcast students: Gavin Strick, U.V., and Rachel Wagner. Steve is also introduced to school psychologist Dr. Edgar Caldicott, who is aware of Steve\u2019s loss and suggests he make new friends by joining a program called the Blue Ribbons, which is described as a \u201cmotivational workshop.\u201d\n\nThe Blue Ribbons are a clique of preppy, clean-cut overachievers who organize bake sales and car washes. Members attempt to recruit Steve into their fold, but Gavin, who is viewed with contempt by the clique, steers him away. Gavin claims they are a murderous cult that has been \u201chypnotized, lobotomized and brainwashed\u201d by Caldicott and that the whole town is in on it, but Steve thinks Gavin is exaggerating.\n\nOutside a store where Gavin tries to score alcohol, Rachel is approached by Chug, a jock Blue Ribbon member with a thing for her. After catching sight of Rachel in her midriff-baring outfit, Chug suddenly snaps into a rage and starts savagely beating up a guy inside the store. Chug nearly kills him while the town\u2019s police chief, Officer Cox, simply looks on. When Steve asks his new friends what just happened, Rachel says it must be [[Anabolic steroid|'roid rage]]. Gavin insists again on his mind control theory, producing photos of his former burnout friends who were \u201creprogrammed\u201d into Blue Ribbons.\n\nGavin takes Steve to a school hideout where they eavesdrop on a PTA meeting presided over by Caldicott. During the meeting, Gavin learns his parents volunteered him for Caldicott\u2019s program. A fearful Gavin brandishes a gun that he plans to use on potential abductors, but Steve calls him paranoid and wrestles the gun away from him. The following day, Gavin shows up to school as a clean-cut Blue Ribbon, with his long hair now cut short, his grungy clothing replaced by a preppy style, and his friendship with Rachel and U.V. coldly tossed aside.\n\nSteve's attempts to reach Gavin are met with hostility from other Blue Ribbons. He is beaten up by the clique, with Gavin landing the final blow. When Steve returns home, he finds Blue Ribbon member Lorna in his living room, having just tutored his younger sister Lindsay. Lorna attempts to seduce him, but in her arousal she flies into a violent rage as her right eye glows red. Repeating the words \u201cwrong, bad\u201d, she smashes a wall mirror with her head and attacks Steve with a shard, but he subdues her and she snaps out of her episode, acting as if nothing happened.\n\nMeanwhile, Steve befriends Mr. Newberry, the school janitor who also harbors suspicions about the Blue Ribbons. He demonstrates a device to Steve that emits a soft, high-pitched whine intended to repel rats. Later, Rachel is cornered in the boiler room by Chug in an attempted rape, but Newberry\u2019s rat-catching device goes off and sends Chug into a frenzy. Rachel escapes and Chug finds the device, destroying it. Newberry, having witnessed the incident, realizes the device acts as an irritant on Blue Ribbons.\n\nIn search of answers, Steve and Rachel venture to Bishop Flats, a nearby mental hospital. Their investigation confirms Gavin\u2019s theory about the Blue Ribbons and mind control: Caldicott is implanting [[Brain implant|brain microchips]] on Cradle Bay teenagers with the approval of their parents, who want to reprogram their kids from juvenile delinquents into well-behaved model citizens. However, Caldicott could not turn off the teenagers\u2019 hormones, resulting in momentary violent fits whenever the subjects\u2019 sexual urges act up. Steve and Rachel attempt to get Lindsay so they can flee town, but they are ambushed by Caldicott and Steve\u2019s parents, who reveal the reason the family moved to Cradle Bay was to sign Steve up for the program. Multiple Blue Ribbons capture Steve and Rachel, and Steve wakes up at the programming place. Steve is strapped into a chair and a technician prepares to reprogram him, but Steve gets hold of a scalpel and frees himself and Rachel.\n\nOn their way out, they encounter Chug, but Rachel is able to strike him with a pipe, killing him. Rescued by Lindsay and U.V. in Rachel\u2019s truck, they rush to catch an outgoing ferry but run into a roadblock where a horde of Blue Ribbons\u2014Caldicott amongst them\u2014is assembled. Newberry suddenly drives up in his car and activates the multiple rat-catching devices strapped to his vehicle, scrambling the mind control tech inside the Blue Ribbons\u2019 heads and sending them maniacally chasing after him.\n\nWhile U.V., Lindsay, and Rachel head for the ferry, Steve follows Newberry on a motorcycle. Newberry, fatally wounded by a gunshot from Caldicott and with multiple Blue Ribbons swarming him, drives his car off of a cliff, taking most of the Ribbons down with him. Steve encounters Caldicott and the two fight, ending with the doctor being pushed off the cliff. Steve rides the motorcycle to the ferry and reunites with Rachel in a kiss. The four teens leave Cradle Bay to begin a new life without their parents.\n\nA final scene cuts to a classroom in an inner-city high school where kids are playing loud music and acting rowdily. A principal walks in the room to introduce a new student teacher. The teacher turns around to face the students and reveals his identity\u2014a survived Gavin, still programmed with the Blue Ribbon technology.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|{{Cast listing|\n* [[James Marsden]] as Steve Clark\n* [[Katie Holmes]] as Rachel Wagner\n* [[Nick Stahl]] as Gavin Strick\n* [[Bruce Greenwood]] as Dr. Edgar Caldicott\n* [[William Sadler (actor)|William Sadler]] as Dorian Newberry\n* [[Steve Railsback]] as Officer Cox\n* [[Chad Donella]] as U.V.\n* [[Tobias Mehler]] as Andy Effkin\n* [[Tygh Runyan]] as Dickie Atkinson\n* [[Katharine Isabelle]] as Lindsay Clark\n* [[Ethan Embry]] as Allen Clark\n* [[Terry David Mulligan]] as Nathan Clark\n* [[Susan Hogan (actress)|Susan Hogan]] as Cynthia Clark\n* Peter LaCroix as Dan Strick \n* [[Lynda Boyd]] as Lucille Strick\n* [[Jay Brazeau]] as Principal Weathers\n* [[A.J.
