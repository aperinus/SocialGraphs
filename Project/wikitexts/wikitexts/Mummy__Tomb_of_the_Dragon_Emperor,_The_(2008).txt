It is the third and final installment in [[The Mummy (franchise)#The Mummy trilogy and a soft-reboot|''The Mummy'' trilogy]]. It stars [[Brendan Fraser]], [[Jet Li]], [[Maria Bello]] (replacing [[Rachel Weisz]], who played Evelyn in the first two films), [[John Hannah (actor)|John Hannah]], [[Luke Ford (actor)|Luke Ford]], [[Anthony Wong (Hong Kong actor)|Anthony Wong]], and [[Michelle Yeoh]].\n\n''The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor'' premiered in [[Moscow]] on July 24, 2008, and was released in the United States on August 1, 2008. The film received mostly negative reviews from critics and grossed $403 million worldwide, the trilogy's lowest-grossing film. [[Universal Pictures]] rebooted the [[The Mummy (2017 film)|Mummy franchise]] in 2017 as an attempt to start the [[Universal Classic Monsters#Legacy|Dark Universe]] franchise.\n\n== Plot ==\nIn [[History of China#Ancient China|ancient]] [[Qin (state)|China]], a warlord [[Han (state)|uni]][[Zhao (state)|tes]] [[Yan (state)|the]] [[Dai (Warring States period)|coun]][[Wei (state)|try's]] [[Chu (state)|king]][[Qi (state)|doms]] into an empire, becoming the [[Qin Shi Huang|Dragon Emperor]]. He led a [[Qin's wars of unification|civil war]] to become the [[Qin dynasty]] since his men were burning all of the books and scrolls, later ordered the construction of the [[Great Wall of China]], and buried his enemies' corpses beneath it. He learns to control [[Fire (wuxing)|fire]], [[Water (wuxing)|water]], [[Earth (wuxing)|earth]], [[Wood (wuxing)|wood]], and [[Metal (wuxing)|metal]]\u2014the traditional Chinese [[Wuxing (Chinese philosophy)|Wuxing]] elements.\n\nHowever, the Emperor grows fearful that his death will end all he has accomplished and summons Zi Yuan, a sorceress. He sends her to an ancient [[monastery]] with his [[second-in-command]], General Ming, to find the long-lost Oracle Bones, which hold the key to eternal life. She and Ming fall in love, despite the [[Emperor of China|Emperor]] wanting Zi Yuan to himself. When one of his servants witnesses them consummating their relationship, the Emperor has Ming executed in retaliation. Yuan curses the Emperor and his soldiers, turning them into the [[Terracotta Army]].\n\nCenturies later, in 1946, Alex O'Connell\u2014[[Rick O'Connell|Rick]] and Evelyn O'Connell's son\u2014and his archaeology professor Roger Wilson find the Emperor's tomb. Though attacked by a mysterious woman, they bring the sarcophagus to [[Shanghai]]. At the same time, the British government entrusts Rick and Evelyn to take a gemstone called the ''Eye of Shangri-La'' back to [[Republic of China (1912\u20131949)|China]].\n\nIn Shanghai during the [[Chinese New Year]], the O'Connells learn that Wilson works for a rogue military faction led by General Yang and his assistant, Colonel Choi, who provided the financial backing of Alex's expedition. Yang believes the Emperor can lead [[China]] out of the chaos following [[World War II]], resurrecting him using the ''Eye of Shangri-La'', which contains mystical water from [[Shangri-La]].\n\nRevived, the Emperor accepts Yang's services but kills Wilson. The O'Connells attempt to stop him with Lin's help, the woman who had earlier attacked Alex, but he escapes. Lin reveals that she possesses the only weapon that can kill the Emperor\u2014a cursed dagger.\n\nAlong with Evelyn's brother, Jonathan Carnahan, the O'Connells and Lin travel to a [[stupa]] in the [[Himalayas]] that will reveal the path to Shangri-La. With help from [[yeti]]s summoned by Lin, the group holds off Yang's forces, but the Emperor discovers Shangri-La's location. The Emperor gravely wounds Rick while Alex triggers an [[avalanche]], slowing the Emperor's pursuit. Lin takes them to Shangri-La, where Zi Yuan still lives and can heal Rick's wound. The group discovers Lin is Yuan's daughter, both rendered immortal by the mystical waters. As Rick heals, Alex and Lin grow close, but Lin cannot bear falling in love with Alex only to watch him grow old and die.\n\nThe Emperor and Yang arrive, and the Emperor bathes in the waters, restoring his human form and granting him massive supernatural power. Morphing into a three-headed [[dragon]], he steals the cursed dagger, kidnaps Lin, and flies back to his tomb. He revives the Terracotta Army, declares his intention for world domination, and directs them to breach the Great Wall, after which they will be invincible.\n\nThe O'Connells and Zi Yuan pursue the Emperor to the Great Wall, where Yuan, using the Oracle Bones, sacrifices her and Lin's immortality to raise an undead army of the Emperor's enemies, led by a revived General Ming. As the two undead armies clash, Alex rescues Lin. Yuan fights the Emperor and steals the dagger from him before he mortally wounds her. As she dies, she gives the blade to Rick and Alex.\n\nThe Emperor retreats into the Great Wall, but Alex and Rick confront him while Evelyn and Lin kill Yang and Choi. After a ferocious fight, Rick and Alex overpower the Emperor and stab him with the dagger, defeating him and destroying the Terracotta Army. Ming and his army briefly celebrate before entering the afterlife.\n\nThe O'Connells and Lin return to Shanghai, where Alex and Lin start a relationship. Jonathan moves to [[Peru]] with the ''Eye of Shangri-La'', intending to live somewhere with no mummies, not knowing that mummies will soon be discovered there.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{main|List of The Mummy (film series) characters}}\n* [[Brendan Fraser]] as [[Rick O'Connell]], a retired adventurer, Evelyn's husband and Alex's father.\n* [[Jet Li]] as [[List of The Mummy (film series) characters#Han (Dragon Emperor)|Han the Dragon Emperor]], an evil warlord who desired immortality.

Instead of the Oracle Bones, Zohora uses the book's terracotta copy to curse the Emperor and his army. The book would also have been used to resurrect the Emperor instead of the Elixir of Life. Jonathan not only named his nightclub after Imhotep but styled the barmaids with [[List of The Mummy (film series) characters|Anck-Su-Namun]]'s bodypaint. The [[Bembridge School|Bembridge Scholars]] that Evy frequently mentioned in the first film would have returned in a minor role as the character Sir Colin Willoughby, the head of the society, would play a role in the Dragon Emperor's resurrection in Wilson's place. In the second film, Meela says three men will \"receive their [your] just rewards.\" The Emperor Mummy says Yang (Okumura) will get his reward when the Emperor conquers the larger world. During the final battle, Alex's slingshot would return to play a vital role in defeating the Emperor.\n\nLike the previous films, this early draft contained more [[body horror]] elements, including a crocodile eating Okumura's arm; and maggots, bone fragments, and fossilized guts seeping through the Emperor Mummy's wounds. After becoming immortal, the Emperor forms a new brain, eyeball, and [[Skin grafting|skin grafts]] over his cracked body. In his mummy form, the Dragon Emperor shared a few similarities with Imhotep: they both drain people's lifeforce to heal themselves (in doing so, the Emperor, however, also turns his victims into terracotta and shatters them); after draining one character, the Emperor Mummy inherits his victim's blue eyes, like Imhotep did in one scene of the second movie; Just as Imhotep made impressions of his face in sand and water in the first and second films, respectively, the Emperor Mummy does the same during the avalanche, making his face appear in the snow. The mummification sequence was also more graphic as the Emperor's heart would've become visible through his chest, pumping black blood through his veins and out of his pores. Then molten clay covers his clothes and body before being superheated and hardened by intense white light beams from within him.\n\nThe script showed the Emperor as having a more ruthless personality. He sends Zohora to Hamunaptra under the threat of killing her lover Ming Guo (Sun Tzu) if she fails to return within 90 days, only to present her with his head in a box when she does. When he becomes immortal, the Emperor puts a searing finger on Okumura's forehead, makes him kneel, and pledge his loyalty. He kisses Zohora to simultaneously spite and curse her by turning her and the other immortals in Shangri-La into terracotta statues. The curse doesn't affect Lin (Lily Chen) because she's already sacrificed her immortality before the Emperor arrives in Shangri-La. Then, as he takes Lily, the Emperor tells her she will pay for her mother's sins by sharing his bed as his queen. During the climax, the Emperor punishes Okumura for his failure by encasing him in a giant brass lantern.\n\nThe script took place in 1940 during World War II instead of afterward. Rick and Evy are introduced in [[Agra|Agra, India]], acting as spies for the British government, observing Okumura, believing he has a secret weapon for the Japanese to win the war, later revealed to be the Emperor. With the backdrop of the war, the script shows the [[Second Sino-Japanese War|tensions between the Chinese and Japanese]], with one scene in Imhotep's where Jonathan calms a dispute between the O'Connells' friend and Chinese resistance member, Chang, and Japanese Major Suki. Another later had the O'Connells reluctantly forced to stand back and watch Chang get captured by Japanese troops, who collect insurgents and send them on trains to work camps, as Lily previously told Alex. It's revealed that despite Rick and Evy sending Alex to [[Yale University|Yale]] to protect him, he left his first year without their knowledge and failed to enlist in the army before being called by Willoughby to work with him. Unlike the film, the O'Connells learn the Emperor has five days to become immortal after he's awakened, or he'll turn to dust. Later, at a monastery in the Himalayas ransacked by Japanese soldiers, they encounter a Tibetan monk they dub Tequila, who joins the group, leading them to the Temple of Whispering Skulls and accompanying them to the Great Wall. Rather than the Emperor Mummy mortally wounding Rick, Alex would've taken the hit to save his dad.\n\nOther notable differences between the script and film include Shangri-La depicted as a lush utopia filled with people from various eras. The Dragon Emperor showed more of his mastery over the five Chinese elements: he freezes and unfreezes a river to escape; rapidly shoots fireballs from his hands; makes \"snow arms\" to drag enemies underground, and makes a raincloud with water from the Spring of Eternal Life to raise his army. Unlike in the movie, he doesn't become a shapeshifter. Many Chinese slave workers and other prisoners the Japanese took, including Chang, ward off the Emperor's Terracotta Army instead of undead warriors. Instead of the one-on-one fight between Rick and the Dragon Emperor, the O'Connells try to complete a ritual involving the five elements to unlock the \"River of Spirits,\" the Emperor's enemies' souls beneath the Great Wall, to defeat the terracotta soldiers as the Emperor tries to stop them. Rick tells the Emperor to give Imhotep his regards after delivering the killing blow. The terracotta curse upon Shangri-La ends with the Emperor's death, freeing its inhabitants, including Zohora.\n\n=== Casting ===\nIn March 2006, actor [[Oded Fehr]], who played Ardeth Bay in the first two films said that Sommers had told him that a third film was in development and being written, with only [[Brendan Fraser]] and [[Rachel Weisz]]'s characters returning.<ref>{{cite news | author=Clint Morris | url=http://www.moviehole.net/news/20060316_fehr_talks_the_mummy_3.html | title=Fehr talks ''The Mummy 3'' | publisher=Moviehole.net | date=March 16, 2006 | access-date=December 29, 2006 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070926225558/http://www.moviehole.net/news/20060316_fehr_talks_the_mummy_3.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archive-date = September 26, 2007}}</ref> The following September, [[Universal Studios|Universal Pictures]] offered director [[Joe Johnston]] the helm, instead of ''[[Development of Jurassic World|Jurassic World]]'' but Johnston declined.<ref>{{cite news | author=Stax | url=http://movies.ign.com/articles/731/731359p1.html | title=Fraser Set For ''Mummy 3''? | publisher=[[IGN]] | date=September 7, 2006 | access-date=February 11, 2007 }}</ref> Later in the month, Weisz expressed interest in reprising her role.<ref>{{cite news | author=Paul Davidson | url=http://movies.ign.com/articles/732/732017p1.html | title=Weisz Wants ''Mummy III'' | publisher=[[IGN]] | date=September 11, 2006 | access-date=December 29, 2006 }}</ref>\n\nIn January 2007, Universal announced Sommers would not direct the third film.
