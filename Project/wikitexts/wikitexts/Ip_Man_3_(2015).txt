His elder son, [[Ip Chun]], has returned to [[Foshan]] to study, leaving Ip with his younger son, [[Ip Ching]], and his wife, [[Cheung Wing-sing]], in Hong Kong. [[Bruce Lee]] visits Ip and asks to become one of his students. After Lee demonstrates his speed, Ip neither accepts nor rejects him, but insinuates for him to leave by opening the door.\n\nAfter Ip Ching gets into a fight with his schoolmate Cheung Fong, their teacher, Miss Wong, asks the parents to come to the school, though only the Ips arrive. As an apology, the Ips invite Fong to their home for dinner. At Ip's house, Fong displays rudimentary but impressive [[Wing Chun]] skills. When asked who his mentor is, Fong says it is his father, Cheung Tin-chi, who shows up to collect his son shortly after. Although Tin-chi interacts cordially with Ip, he secretly envies and seeks to surpass him.\n\nTin-chi participates in underground fights organized by Ma King-sang, a local [[Triad (organized crime)|triad]] leader who works for Frank, an American property developer and highly proficient boxer. Frank orders Ma to acquire the land occupied by the school where Ching and Fong study. When Ip goes to collect his son from school, he witnesses Ma and his men beating the school principal after he refuses to sell. Ip intervenes and restrains Ma, but is forced to release him. Ip seeks help from his close friend Fat Po, a local police sergeant. Po agrees to help, but says that he lacks the manpower and influence to protect the school every day. Ip then decides to guard the school alongside his students.\n\nThat night, Ma's men set fire to the school and attempt to kidnap the principal. Tin-chi happens to be passing by, and helps fight off Ma's thugs. Tin Ngo-san, a local martial arts master and Ma's former mentor, is enraged by Ma's unscrupulous acts and confronts Ma at a Hong Kong shipyard, humiliating him in front of his men. Ma retaliates with a hidden knife, but Ip stops him. Po arrives and keeps tensions from escalating further. Ma offers Tin-chi a large sum of money to get revenge against Ngo-san on his behalf. Desperate for money and wanting to open his own martial arts school, Tin-chi accepts the offer and attacks Ngo-san, hospitalizing him.\n\nIp receives a call from the hospital and visits Ngo-san. Upon learning that Ngo-san did not call him, Ip realizes it was a set-up by Ma to lure him away from the school, where Ma's gang have abducted some of the students, including Ching and Fong. Ip arrives alone at Ma's shipyard, where Ma holds Ching at knife point and threatens to sell the children into slavery if the principal refuses to sell the school. Tin-chi is allowed to leave with Fong due to being an associate, but after his son tells him that they still have his friends, he returns and fights alongside Ip. Ip and Tin-chi hold their own until a troop of policemen led by Po arrives to arrest the gang. Frank dismisses Ma for his failures and sends a Thai boxer after Ip instead.\n\nReturning home, Ip learns that Wing-sing has been diagnosed with cancer. On their way home from a medicine shop, Ip and Wing-sing are attacked in an elevator by the Thai boxer, who Ip defeats before the elevator reaches the ground floor. Po tells Ip about Frank, who wants to eliminate Ip at all costs for obstructing his plans. Ip confronts Frank in his office, where Frank promises to leave the school alone if Ip can last an entire three minute fight. Initially overwhelmed by Frank's muscle and sheer force, Ip turns the tide by attacking Frank's lower half. They fight to a draw after the three minutes pass; seemingly impressed, Frank keeps his promise.\n\nTin-chi opens his martial arts school with the money he obtained from Ma, and claims that his Wing Chun is genuine while Ip's is not. He publicly challenges Ip to a battle that will decide who is the true Grandmaster of Wing Chun. However, Ip instead spends more time with his ailing wife, ashamedly feeling that he had neglected her. Wanting to dance with his wife, Ip is taught how to dance by Lee, whom Ip finally accepts as a student; because of Ip's failure to attend, Tin-chi is declared the winner. Wing-sing makes arrangements for another match on her husband's behalf, correctly guessing that Ip would have attended if not for her deteriorating health, and accompanies him to the fight. After a long battle involving staffs, butterfly knives and unarmed combat, Ip eventually overpowers Tin-chi. Accepting defeat, Tin-chi destroys the banner proclaiming himself Grandmaster, and Ip tells him that spending time with their loved ones is more important than competing with others.\n\nA closing onscreen text states that Wing-sing died in 1960, and that Ip helped make Wing Chun well known internationally and left a legacy.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Donnie Yen]] as [[Ip Man]] (\u8449\u554f), an unassuming Chinese Wing Chun master originally from [[Foshan]].\n* [[Zhang Jin (actor)|Zhang Jin]] as Cheung Tin-chi (\u5f35\u5929\u5fd7) also known as [[Sum Nung]],<ref name=\"Ip Man 3 Blackbelt\">{{Cite news |date=2015 |title=DONNIE YEN IS BACK AND READY TO PORTRAY THE WING CHUN LEGEND IN IP MAN 3 |work=[[Black Belt Magazine]] |publisher=Black Belt Magazine 1000 LLC |issue=Online |url=https://blackbeltmag.com/arts/history-philosophy/donnie-yen-is-back-and-ready-to-portray-the-wing-chun-legend-in-ip-man-3 |url-status=live |access-date=24 November 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181124162526/https://blackbeltmag.com/arts/history-philosophy/donnie-yen-is-back-and-ready-to-portray-the-wing-chun-legend-in-ip-man-3 |archive-date=24 November 2018 |ref=Ip Man 3 Blackbelt}}</ref><ref name=\"Dramasian\">{{Cite news |last=B |first=Lee |date=14 November 2015 |title=Donnie Yen Experiences Mike Tyson's Fists in \"Ip Man 3\" |work=Dramasian |publisher=Damasian |issue=Online |url=https://www.dramasian.com/threads/donnie-yen-experiences-mike-tysons-fists-in-ip-man-3.87464/ |url-status=live |access-date=24 November 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181124162454/https://www.dramasian.com/threads/donnie-yen-experiences-mike-tysons-fists-in-ip-man-3.87464/ |archive-date=24 November 2018 |ref=Dramasian}}</ref> a martial artist from the same Wing Chun lineage as Ip Man.
