The [[biopic]] stars [[Rachel Weisz]] as [[Hypatia]], a mathematician, philosopher and astronomer in late 4th-century [[Egypt (Roman province)|Roman Egypt]], who investigates the flaws of the [[geocentric]] [[Ptolemaic system]] and the [[heliocentrism|heliocentric]] model that challenges it. Surrounded by religious turmoil and social unrest, Hypatia struggles to save the knowledge of [[classical antiquity]] from destruction. [[Max Minghella]] co-stars as Davus, Hypatia's father's slave, and [[Oscar Isaac]] as Hypatia's student, and later prefect of Alexandria, [[Orestes (prefect)|Orestes]].\n\nThe story uses [[historical fiction]] to highlight the [[relationship between religion and science]] at the time amidst the [[decline of Greco-Roman polytheism]] and the [[Christianization of the Roman Empire]]. The title of the film takes its name from the ''[[agora]]'', a public gathering place in ancient Greece, similar to the Roman ''[[Forum (Roman)|forum]]''. The film was produced by Fernando Bovaira and shot on the island of [[Malta]] from March to June 2008. [[Justin Pollard]], co-author of ''The Rise and Fall of Alexandria'' (2007), was the historical adviser for the film.\n\n''Agora'' was screened out of competition at the [[2009 Cannes Film Festival]] in May, and opened in Spain on 9 October 2009 becoming the highest-grossing film of the year for that country. Although the film had difficulty finding distribution, it was released country by country throughout late 2009 and early 2010. The film received a 53% overall approval rating from [[Rotten Tomatoes]] and seven [[Goya Awards]] in Spain, including Best Original Screenplay. It was awarded the [[Alfred P. Sloan Foundation Feature Film Prize]] at the [[Hamptons International Film Festival]]. It has also received sharp criticism for historical inaccuracies; one authoritative reference work on the [[history of science]] rebuked the film as \"spectacularly anachronistic\".\n\n==Plot==\nIn 391 AD, [[History of Alexandria#Late Roman and Byzantine period|Alexandria]] is part of the [[Roman Empire]], and Greek philosopher [[Hypatia]] is a teacher at the [[Platonism|Platonic]] school, where future leaders are educated. Hypatia is the daughter of [[Theon of Alexandria|Theon]], the director of the [[Musaeum]] of Alexandria. Hypatia, her father's [[slave]], Davus, and two of her pupils, [[Orestes (prefect)|Orestes]] and [[Synesius]], are immersed in the changing political and social landscape. She rejects Orestes's love as she prefers to devote herself to science. Davus assists Hypatia in her classes and is interested in science. He is also secretly in love with her.\n\nMeanwhile, social unrest begins challenging the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] rule of the city as [[Paganism|Pagans]] and [[Christians]] come into conflict. When the Christians start verbally insulting the statutes of the pagan gods, the pagans, including Orestes and Theon, ambush the Christians. However, in the ensuing battle, the pagans unexpectedly find themselves outnumbered by a large Christian mob. Theon is gravely injured, and Hypatia and the pagans take refuge in the [[Serapeum of Alexandria|Library of the Serapeum]]. The Christian siege of the library ends when an envoy of the Roman Emperor [[Theodosius I]] declares that the pagans are pardoned, but the Christians shall be allowed to take possession of the library. Hypatia and the pagans flee while trying to save the most important [[scroll]]s before the Christians overtake the library and destroy its contents. Davus chooses to join the Christian forces. He later returns with a [[gladius]] and [[sexual assault|sexually assaults]] her, but he begins to sob and offers his sword to her. However, she removes his slave collar and tells him that he is free.\n\nSeveral years later, Orestes, now converted to Christianity, is [[prefect]] of Alexandria. Hypatia continues to investigate the motions of the [[Timeline of discovery of Solar System planets and their moons#Prehistory|Sun, the Moon, the five known \"wanderers\" (planets)]], and the stars. Some Christians ridicule the thinking that [[spherical Earth|the Earth is a sphere]] by arguing that people far from the top would fall off the Earth. When they ask Davus what his opinion is, he avoids conflict by saying that only God knows these things.\n\nHypatia also investigates the [[heliocentrism|heliocentric model]] of the solar system proposed by [[Aristarchus of Samos]] by having an object dropped from the mast of a moving ship which demonstrates that a possible motion of the Earth would not affect the motion, relative to Earth, of a falling object on Earth. However, due to [[Heliocentrism#Religious attitudes to heliocentrism|religious objections against heliocentrism]], the Christians have now forbidden Hypatia to teach at the school. The Christians and the [[Judaism|Jews]] come into violent conflict.\n\nThe leader of the Christians, [[Cyril of Alexandria|Cyril]], views Hypatia as having too much influence over Orestes and stages a public ceremony intended to force Orestes to subjugate her. Hypatia's former pupil, Synesius, now the [[Bishop]] of [[Cyrene, Libya|Cyrene]], comes to her rescue as a religious authority counterweight but says he cannot help her unless she accepts Christianity; she refuses. Hypatia theorizes that the Earth orbits around the Sun in an [[elliptic orbit]], not a circular orbit, with the Sun at one of the [[focus (geometry)|foci]]. Cyril convinces a mob of Christians that Hypatia is a [[witch]], and they vow to kill her. Davus tries to run ahead to warn Hypatia, but she is captured. They strip Hypatia and are about to skin her alive until Davus persuades the mob otherwise, and they decide to [[stoning|stone]] her instead. When the mob goes outside to collect stones, Davus suffocates her to spare her the pain of being stoned and tells the mob that she fainted. Davus leaves as they begin to stone her.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Rachel Weisz]] as [[Hypatia of Alexandria]]. Weisz was already a fan of Amen\u00e1bar's work when she received the script, and was very interested in the role.<ref name=\"Zona\">{{cite web|title=\"Agora\" entrevista Rachel Weisz|url=https://www.youtube.com/watchv=uKHGdj_NqS4&feature=related|publisher=Zona Trailer|accessdate=July 4, 2021}} See also: {{cite web|last=Fine|first=Marshall|authorlink=Marshall fine|date=June 1, 2010|title=The Rachel Weisz theorem|url=http://hollywoodandfine.com/interviews/?p=742|publisher=hollywoodandfine.com|accessdate=June 9, 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100605154843/http://hollywoodandfine.com/interviews/?p=742|archivedate=June 5, 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref> Although she had not heard of Hypatia before, she felt that her history was still relevant to the contemporary world: \"Really, nothing has changed.
