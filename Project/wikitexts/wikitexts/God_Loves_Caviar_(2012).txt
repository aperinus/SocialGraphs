He was born in [[Psara]], and from an early age he learned to navigate the seas, an occupation revered and steeped in tradition on the island where he grew up. At the age of 17 he built his own ship, which he would later offer to the [[Russians]] during the [[Orlov Revolt]]. Ultimately, his ship was destroyed, and he turned to [[Saint Petersburg]] to ask for an audience with [[Catherine the Great]]. He was given compensation for the loss of his ship and granted authorization to fish freely in the [[Caspian Sea]]. Due to his superb navigational skills and excellent seamanship abilities, he dominated the [[Caspian Sea]] and soon became substantially wealthy. When he initially discovered the superior [[caviar]] of the Beluga Sturgeon, he quickly discerned that there could be an incredible market trading for this product. From the [[caviar]] trade he eventually became a millionaire and later donated part of his fortune for important works that improved the life of Russians and Greeks on the [[Black Sea]] coasts. In his later years, he became a member of the [[Filiki Eteria]], which would contribute to the overthrow of the Ottoman rule of Greece. He died in 1825 in [[Zante]], during the [[Greek War of Independence]]. After his death, his entire estate went to the Ioannis Varvakis Foundation which would offer up important grants throughout Greece. The script follows the entire life of Varvakis, but the film's narration begins with his final moments in Zante.<ref>{{cite web|title=God Loves Caviar\" by Iannis Smaragdis / Toronto 2012 review|url=http://flix.gr/en/god-loves-caviar-by-iannis-smaragdis-toronto-2012.html|publisher=flix.gr|access-date=2 January 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=\u039f \u0392\u03b1\u03c1\u03b2\u03ac\u03ba\u03b7\u03c2 |url=http://godlovescaviar.gr/blog/%CE%BF-%CE%B2%CE%B1%CF%81%CE%B2%CE%B1%CE%BA%CE%B7%CF%83/ |publisher=godlovescaviar.gr |access-date=2 January 2015 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150530072309/http://godlovescaviar.gr/blog/%CE%BF-%CE%B2%CE%B1%CF%81%CE%B2%CE%B1%CE%BA%CE%B7%CF%83/ |archive-date=30 May 2015  }}</ref>\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Sebastian Koch]] as [[Ioannis Varvakis]]\n* [[Yevgeny Stychkin]] as Ivan\n* [[Juan Diego Botto]] as Alexios Lefentarios\n* [[Olga Sutulova]] as Helena Romachoff\n* [[John Cleese]] as McCormick\n* [[Catherine Deneuve]] as Empress Catherine II of Russia\n* [[Akis Sakellariou]] as Kimon\n* [[Nick Ashdon]] as British Ambassador\n* [[Marisha Triantafyllidou]] as Maria Varvakis\n* [[Alexandra Sakelaropoulou]] as Varvakis' Mother\n* [[Fotini Baxevani]] as Ludmilla\n* [[Christoforos Papakaliatis]] as Grigori Potemkin\n* [[Lakis Lazopoulos]] as Fisherman of God\n* [[Irene Balta]] as Varvakis' Wife\n* [[Pavlos Kontoyannidis]] as Shipbuilder\n* [[Alexandros Mylonas]] as Temporary Prime Minister\n* [[Yannis Vouros]] as Businessman A\n* [[Manos Vakousis]] as Businessman B\n* [[Giorgos Ktenavos]] as Andreas Varvakis\n* [[Kris Radanov]] as [[Alexei Grigoryevich Orlov|Alexei Orlov]]\n* [[Giorgos Kotanidis]] as [[Theodoros Kolokotronis]]\n\n==Reception==\nThe film was one of the official selections that debuted in [[2012 Toronto Film Festival]].<ref>{{cite web|title=\u03a0\u03b1\u03b3\u03ba\u03cc\u03c3\u03bc\u03b9\u03b1 \u03a0\u03c1\u03b5\u03bc\u03b9\u03ad\u03c1\u03b1 \u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \u03c4\u03b1\u03b9\u03bd\u03af\u03b1\u03c2 \"\u039f \u0398\u03b5\u03cc\u03c2 \u03b1\u03b3\u03b1\u03c0\u03ac\u03b5\u03b9 \u03c4\u03bf \u03a7\u03b1\u03b2\u03b9\u03ac\u03c1\u03b9\" \u03c3\u03c4\u03bf \u0394\u03b9\u03b5\u03b8\u03bd\u03ad\u03c2 \u03a6\u03b5\u03c3\u03c4\u03b9\u03b2\u03ac\u03bb \u039a\u03b9\u03bd\u03b7\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03b3\u03c1\u03ac\u03c6\u03bf\u03c5 \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 \u03a4\u03bf\u03c1\u03cc\u03bd\u03c4\u03bf. |url=http://godlovescaviar.gr/blog/2012/08/16/pagosmia-premiera-toronto-film-festival/ |publisher=godlovescaviar.gr |access-date=2 January 2015 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150102211203/http://godlovescaviar.gr/blog/2012/08/16/pagosmia-premiera-toronto-film-festival/ |archive-date=2 January 2015  }}</ref> In 2013 the film was the highest-grossing film in Greece.<ref>{{cite web|title=God Loves Caviar serves up a hero in Greece's hour of need|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2012/nov/20/god-loves-caviar-greece-cinema|publisher=theguardian.com|access-date=2 January 2015}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|2181959|God Loves Caviar}}\n* {{Rotten Tomatoes|god_loves_caviar}}\n* [http://www.godlovescaviarthemovie.gr/index.html Official site]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:God Loves Caviar}}\n[[Category:2012 films]]\n[[Category:2012 drama films]]\n[[Category:2010s adventure drama films]]\n[[Category:2010s English-language films]]\n[[Category:English-language Greek films]]\n[[Category:English-language Russian films]]\n[[Category:Films set in 1825]]\n[[Category:Russian adventure drama films]]\n[[Category:Greek biographical films]]\n[[Category:Greek adventure drama films]]\n[[Category:Greek multilingual films]]\n[[Category:2010s Greek-language films]]\n[[Category:Pirate films]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Crete]]"}]}}}}
