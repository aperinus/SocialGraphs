The film stars Shandling, [[Annette Bening]], [[Greg Kinnear]], [[Ben Kingsley]], [[Linda Fiorentino]], and [[John Goodman]].<ref name=\"What Planet Are You From?\"/>\n\n==Plot==\nA denizen ([[Garry Shandling]]) of a faraway planet occupied only by highly evolved males is ordered by his superior, Graydon ([[Ben Kingsley]]), to find a female human, impregnate her and bring the baby back to the planet.\n\nThe visitor to Earth ends up in [[Phoenix, Arizona]], where he assumes the name Harold Anderson and takes a job in a bank. There he meets a  womanizing co-worker Perry Gordon ([[Greg Kinnear]]), who goes to [[Alcoholics Anonymous]] meetings strictly to meet women. Harold accompanies him to one and meets Susan ([[Annette Bening]]), a recovering alcoholic.\n\nHe must marry her before he can try to mate. After their wedding in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]], Susan finds herself wildly satisfied by Harold, even though men from his planet have no genitals and he has been equipped for his Earth visit with a penis that makes a loud whirring sound whenever he gets an erection.\n\nHarold and Susan have a difficult time conceiving a baby. Meanwhile, Roland Jones ([[John Goodman]]), an employee of the [[Federal Aviation Administration|FAA]] who learned of Harold's odd behavior on an airplane, has become obsessed with proving him to be an alien and being the first one to find him.\n\nWhen the child is born, Harold, following orders, abandons his wife and returns to his planet, but his sadness over hurting Susan leaves him with guilt and second thoughts even though people from his world theoretically have no emotions, so against the wishes of Graydon, he returns the baby to Susan and tells her the truth.  Susan is angry, grateful, and completely disbelieving.  Harold offers to prove that he is in fact an alien and does so just as Roland arrives, viewing Harold's \"act of proof\" through the window.  Instead of forgiving him and welcoming him back into their relationship, Susan breaks down in tears, saying, \"I thought I had things right but then I married an alien!\"  Harold leaves.\n\nOnce outside, Harold sees Roland, who is delighted to know he was right all along about Harold being an alien. Roland implores Harold to come with him and admit this to his wife, who doesn't believe him about Harold. Harold charitably agrees, but before that can happen, Graydon shows up with a phaser. Holding Harold at gunpoint, he declares he's taking Harold back. Roland pulls his gun on the leader, who brags, \"none of your primitive weapons can hurt me, and I can heal instantly from anything,\" and shoots him in the chest. Graydon falls dead into the fountain.\n\nSusan comes outside and says she thinks they should try to patch things up after all. Roland happily walks off with Graydon's alien body. Susan and Harold retake their vows in the wedding she says she always wanted. On the drive home, he tells her that the citizens of his planet want him to take over as leader. They discuss it, but she doesn't want to move since all her friends are here, and she knows nothing about the school system there. Harold grudgingly agrees to make the very long commute.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Garry Shandling]] as Harold Anderson\n* [[Annette Bening]] as Susan Anderson\n* [[Greg Kinnear]] as Perry Gordon\n* [[Ben Kingsley]] as Graydon\n* [[Linda Fiorentino]] as Helen Gordon\n* [[John Goodman]] as Roland Jones\n* [[Judy Greer]] as Rebecca\n* Danny Zorn as Randy\n* Harmony Smith as Rita\n* [[Richard Jenkins]] as Don Fisk\n* [[Caroline Aaron]] as Nadine Jones\n* [[Nora Dunn]] as Madeline\n* Cricky Long as Janice\n* [[Camryn Manheim]] as Alison\n* [[Ann Cusack]] as Liz\n* [[Phill Lewis]] as Other MD\n* [[Janeane Garofalo]] as upset airline passenger\n* [[Octavia Spencer]] as baby nurse\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Release==\n''What Planet Are You From?'' opened theatrically on March 3, 2000, in 2,248 venues, earning $3,008,746 in its first weekend and ranking fourteenth in the North American box office.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/weekend/chart/?yr=2000&wknd=09&p=.htm | title=Weekend Box Office Results for March 3-5, 2000 | work=[[Box Office Mojo]] | publisher=[[Internet Movie Database]] | date=March 6, 2000 | access-date=March 26, 2016}}</ref> The film ended its run, having grossed $6,291,602 domestically and $7,854,075 overseas for a worldwide total of $14,145,677.
