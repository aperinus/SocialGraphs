The film grossed over $50 million worldwide on a budget of $25 million,<ref>{{Citation|title=Bride of Chucky|date=16 October 1998|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0144120/|access-date=2020-01-31}}</ref> and received mixed reviews from critics. A sequel, ''[[Seed of Chucky]]'', was released in 2004.\n\n==Plot==\n[[Tiffany Valentine]], a former lover and accomplice of [[serial killer]] [[Chucky (character)|Charles Lee Ray]], bribes a police officer into giving her the [[Child's Play 3|dismembered parts of a children's doll]]\u2014which Ray's soul inhabited\u2014from an evidence locker before murdering him. Believing that Ray's soul still inhabits the doll, Tiffany stitches and staples Chucky back together and reenacts the voodoo ritual which had instilled Ray's soul inside the doll ten years prior.\n\nThough her incantations appear to fail, Chucky comes alive and smothers Tiffany's [[Goth subculture|goth]] admirer Damien to death with a pillow as Tiffany watches in excitement. Tiffany presents Chucky with a ring he had left behind [[Child's Play (1988 film)|the night he was killed]], which she believed to be an [[engagement ring]]. When Chucky explains he never intended on marrying Tiffany, she locks him in a playpen and taunts him with a bride doll. Chucky escapes the playpen and murders Tiffany by electrocuting her in a bathtub.\n\nHe then transports her soul into the bride doll, and says they must retrieve a magical [[amulet]] that was buried with his human body in order to transfer their souls into the bodies of Tiffany's neighbor Jesse and his girlfriend Jade. Tiffany calls Jesse and asks him to take the two dolls to [[Hackensack, New Jersey]], where Ray's body is buried, in exchange for money. Eager to [[elopement|elope]] with Jade, Jesse accepts the offer. Jade's strict uncle, police chief Warren Kincaid, plants a bag of [[marijuana]] in Jesse's van to frame him. Chucky and Tiffany rig a trap which embeds several nails into Warren's face, then hide his body within the van. Jesse and Jade begin their trip. The two are pulled over by Officer Norton, who finds the marijuana in Jesse's van. After Norton returns to his patrol car to report it, Chucky stuffs a shirt into the car's gas tank and lights it on fire. The car explodes with Norton inside, and Jesse and Jade flee the scene.\n\nThey both begin to suspect that one of them might have caused the incident and begin to distrust each other. Despite their issues, Jesse and Jade get married. While at a hotel, another couple steals Jesse's money. As the couple have sex in their room, Tiffany murders them by causing them to be impaled by glass shards. Seeing this, Chucky proposes to Tiffany and the two have sex. The following morning, Jesse and Jade flee with their friend David, who came to the hotel after they both called him separately the previous night, worried the other might be the killer. David informs Jesse and Jade that they are the [[prime suspect]]s for the deaths, but says he believes them to both be innocent. Upon finding Warren's dead body, David holds them at gunpoint and alerts a police officer. The dolls come alive, causing David to back onto the highway, where he is run over. Jesse and Jade drive away with the dolls, who reveal their plan.\n\nThey steal an [[recreational vehicle|RV]] to evade the police, where Jesse and Jade instigate a fight between Chucky and Tiffany; in the commotion, Jade locks Tiffany into an oven, Jesse pushes Chucky out the window, and the RV crashes into a ditch. Chucky forces Jade to take him to his gravesite while Jesse follows with Tiffany. Obeying Chucky's orders, Jade retrieves the amulet from the casket. Jesse then appears with Tiffany and they trade hostages, but Chucky throws a knife into Jesse's back and ties up the couple for the ritual. As Chucky begins the incantation, Tiffany kisses him and stabs him with his knife. A battle ensues, and Tiffany collapses after being stabbed in the heart by Chucky. Jesse knocks Chucky into his own grave with a shovel. Private investigator Lt. Preston arrives and sees Chucky, walking and talking in the grave. Jade grabs Preston's gun and shoots Chucky several times in the chest, killing him.\n\nAfter contacting the police and declaring the teens innocent, Preston sends the couple on their way home. As he inspects Tiffany's body, she springs awake and starts screaming, giving birth to a baby doll which attacks Preston.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Jennifer Tilly]] as [[Tiffany Valentine|Tiffany]]<!-- Ordered by the end credits listing.
