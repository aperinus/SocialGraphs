The film co-stars [[Nat Faxon]], [[Will Forte]], [[Ralf M\u00f6ller]], [[Mo'Nique]], [[Eric Christian Olsen]], [[J\u00fcrgen Prochnow]], and [[Cloris Leachman]]. It was theatrically released on August 25, 2006.\n\n==Plot==\n<!--Please don't include the pre-credit scene concerning Potfest; it doesn't serve the plot in any way, nor was there a movie made after it-->\n\nAt the funeral of their German-born grandfather Johann von Wolfhausen, half-wit brothers Jan and Todd Wolfhouse discover that family tradition demands that they travel to [[Munich]] at [[Oktoberfest]] to spread his cremated ashes at the [[Theresienwiese]]. There, the brothers unintentionally start an altercation that takes down an entire Oktoberfest tent. They then participate in Beerfest, an underground [[drinking game]] tournament run by Baron Wolfgang von Wolfhausen, where they discover that the von Wolfhausens are related to the Wolfhouses. The German team angrily denies the family ties, revealing that Johann was a stable boy who stole the recipe for \"''ze'' greatest beer in all ''ze'' world\" decades ago and ran away with his prostitute mother (the brothers' great grandmother), Great Gam Gam. Enraged by the mockery of their ancestors, Jan and Todd challenge the Germans to a drinking game. The brothers' defeat humiliates them in front of everybody, with Wolfgang pouring their grandfather's ashes on them and Jan gets punched in the eye.\n\nSwearing to get revenge on the Germans, Jan and Todd return to [[Colorado]] where they recruit their drinking friends from college\u2014[[binge drinker]] Phil \"Landfill\" Krundle, [[American Jews|Jewish]] scientist Charlie \"Fink\" Finklestein, and [[male prostitute]] Barry Badrinath\u2014to assemble an American Beerfest team, though they do not divulge this to Great Gam Gam. During the team's year of training, Jan and Todd find out that their grandfather did not steal the family beer recipe, but was actually the rightful heir to the family brewery in [[Bavaria]]. The team uses the rediscovered recipe to brew Schnitzengiggle Beer, whose delicious taste fills them with awe.\n\nAfter the German team receive a bottle of Schnitzengiggle in the mail, the Wolfhausen clan goes to America to take the recipe back. Following a confrontation between the Wolfhausens and Jan and Todd, the Wolfhausens forge evidence that the brothers' restaurant has health issues to put them out of business. Fink quits the team, having been fired due to a slipping performance at the lab. Meanwhile, Landfill catches Great Gam Gam's [[caregiver]] Cherry stealing the beer recipe for the Germans. He overwhelms Cherry in a fight, but is pushed into a vat full of beer that drowns him due to the yeast ingredient submerging him. Minutes later, Jan discovers Landfill's body. Thinking Landfill committed [[suicide]] because of the strain that his involvement was putting on their marriage, the team decides to disband.\n\nAfter the funeral, Great Gam Gam reveals that she knew about Beerfest the entire time. She then motivates the bereaved team with a rousing speech, and everyone except Barry change their minds. Barry explains that he cannot join due to a traumatizing incident years ago during a game of [[table tennis]], in which the big end of a racket was forcefully shoved up his anus. Sympathizing with Barry, Great Gam Gam encourages him to rise above it, causing him to relent and join the team. Shortly after, Landfill's Southern twin brother Gil reveals himself to the group and offers to join the team, which they accept. Like his brother; Gil can drink copious amounts of beer, and he even invites the other members of the team to call him \"Landfill\" in his memory.\n\nIn Germany, the team uses an empty wooden keg as a Trojan Horse to get inside, where they emerge to boos and jeers. The Americans are allowed to participate after Jan and Todd show how uncannily they resemble the two Beerfest founders, thus convincing the crowd of their von Wolfhausen ancestry. In the finals (bootline chug), Cherry gibes Gil about the death of his brother, causing him to crack and the Germans to win. Jan offers the Germans a double or nothing opportunity. The Germans tell Jan they already have the recipe and thus no need for a rematch, but Fink points out that Cherry only stole a recipe for a low-carbohydrate strawberry beer, prompting Wolfgang to have Cherry killed. When one of the von Wolfhausens knocks off Fink's [[yarmulke]], he enters into a state of purely concentrated rage which allows him to coach the team to victory, barely gaining the win when the German team's anchor fails to finish \"Das Boot\" ([[Boot of beer]]) by one drop.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Paul Soter]] as Jan Wolfhouse\n* [[Erik Stolhanske]] as Todd Wolfhouse / Baron Ludwig von Wolfhausen\n* [[Cloris Leachman]] as Great Gam Gam Wolfhouse\n* [[Donald Sutherland]] as Johann von Wolfhouse\n* [[Jay Chandrasekhar]] as Barry Badrinath\n* [[Kevin Heffernan (actor)|Kevin Heffernan]] as Phil \"Landfill\" Krundle / Gil \"Landfill\" Krundle/Random Sausage Lady\n* [[Blanchard Ryan]] as Krista Krundle\n* [[Steve Lemme]] as Charlie \"Fink\" Finkelstein/Emcee\n* [[J\u00fcrgen Prochnow]] as Baron Wolfgang von Wolfhausen\n* [[Nat Faxon]] as Rolf\n* [[Will Forte]] as Otto\n* [[Eric Christian Olsen]] as Gunther\n* [[Ralf M\u00f6ller]] as Hammacher\n* [[Gunter Schlierkamp]] as Schlemmer\n* [[Mo'Nique]] as Cherry\n* [[M.

When asked about where the concept for the film came from, [[Jay Chandrasekhar]] said \"We were at a Beer garden in Australia (wearing our police uniforms) and we went on stage and challenged the top five drinkers in the room to a chug off. The place exploded. We were winning, but then [[Paul Soter]] started drinking and we quickly lost. Then we had arm wrestling contests. Then [[Steve Lemme]] insulted national treasure, [[Russell Crowe]] and we had to be escorted out by security. We thought that would be a fun movie.
