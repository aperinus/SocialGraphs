It is the second installment in the [[Austin Powers|''Austin Powers'' film series]], after ''[[International Man of Mystery]]''.

The film centers on Dr. Evil returning again from cryostasis to strike at Powers from the past, using a time machine to remove Powers' charisma (\"mojo\") and deprive him of whatever qualities made him an effective secret agent so he can no longer interfere with Evil's plans.\n\nThe most commercially successful movie in the Austin Powers series, the film grossed around $312 million in worldwide ticket sales, taking more money during its opening weekend than the entire box office proceeds of its predecessor. It was nominated at the [[72nd Academy Awards]] for [[Academy Award for Best Makeup and Hairstyling|Best Makeup]] ([[Mich\u00e8le Burke]] and [[Mike Smithson (make-up artist)|Mike Smithson]]).<ref>{{cite web|title=Nominees & Winners for the 72nd Academy Awards|url=http://www.oscars.org/awards/academyawards/oscarlegacy/2000-2009/72nominees.html|access-date=March 26, 2014|work=[[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]]|publisher=AMPAS|archive-date=August 6, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110806045730/http://www.oscars.org/awards/academyawards/oscarlegacy/2000-2009/72nominees.html|url-status=live}}</ref> It is followed by ''[[Austin Powers in Goldmember]]'' (2002).\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1999, British spy [[Austin Powers (character)|Austin Powers]] enjoys his [[honeymoon]] with his wife, [[Vanessa Kensington]]. It is revealed that Vanessa has always been a [[Gynoid|fembot]] controlled by [[Dr. Evil (character)|Dr. Evil]], after she attempts to kill Powers. Dr. Evil then causes Vanessa to self-destruct. Austin grieves briefly before realizing he is single again and thus can have [[one-night stand|sex without commitment]]. A [[NATO]] monitoring facility observes the return of Dr. Evil from space, who confronts his son Scott and starts a [[coup]] on ''[[The Jerry Springer Show]]''. At Dr. Evil's lair in [[Seattle]], he is presented with a one-eighth-size [[cloning|clone]] of himself, whom he names [[Mini-Me]].\n\nNumber 2 reveals their company has purchased [[Starbucks]] but Dr. Evil nonetheless unveils his latest plan: he has developed a [[time machine]] to go back to the 1960s and steal Austin's [[Mojo (African-American culture)|mojo]], the source of his sexual appeal. Dr. Evil and Mini-Me travel to 1969 and meet a younger Number 2 and [[Frau Farbissina]]. An [[obese]] \"[[Scots Guards|Scottish Guard]]\", [[Fat Bastard (character)|Fat Bastard]], extracts Austin's mojo from his frozen body at the [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]] (MOD). British intelligence warns Austin that one of Dr. Evil's agents is after him, and during a photo shoot the wanton Ivana Humpalot seduces him, but at the last moment claims he is too sexy to kill. They have sex, but he discovers he has lost his mojo and is [[impotent]].\n\nThe MOD sends Austin to 1969 using a time-travelling [[Volkswagen New Beetle]]. Austin arrives at a party in his [[London]] pad, and with the assistance of [[CIA]] agent Felicity Shagwell escapes an assassination attempt by Dr. Evil's operatives. Austin and Felicity are pursued by Mustafa, another of Dr. Evil's henchmen; when caught he reveals the existence of Dr. Evil's [[volcano]] lair. Before he can divulge its location, Mini-Me shoots him with a dart, causing him to fall off a cliff.\n\nExamining photographs from the crime scene, Austin identifies Fat Bastard as the perpetrator of the theft of his mojo. At Dr. Evil's lair, Fat Bastard arrives with Austin's mojo. Dr. Evil drinks some of it and has sex with Frau Farbissina. This results in an awkward situation when Frau reveals she is pregnant before Scott, Dr. Evil's son, arrives through the time portal. Dr. Evil announces his latest plan&nbsp;\u2014 to hold the world ransom by threatening to destroy cities using a [[laser]] on the Moon. In London, Austin and Felicity get to know each other, but when Felicity tries having sex with him, he turns her down because of his lost mojo.\n\nUnder MOD instructions to implant a [[homing device]] into Fat Bastard, Felicity seduces him and has sex with him, allowing her to plant the device in his [[anus]]. Fat Bastard forces it out of his [[bowels]] into a [[Paddington Station]] toilet, but a [[Human feces|stool sample]] reveals traces of a vegetable that only grows on one [[Caribbean]] island. Austin and Felicity arrive on the island but are apprehended. They are put in a cell with a guard who is overcome when Felicity exposes her breasts. Dr. Evil and Mini-Me leave for the Moon to install the laser pursued by Austin and Felicity on [[Apollo 11]]. In Dr. Evil's moon base, Austin battles with Mini-Me, eventually flushing him into space. As Austin confronts Dr. Evil, Dr. Evil gives him a choice: save the world or Felicity, who is locked in a chamber with poison gas.\n\nFelicity tells Austin to save the world and he succeeds, but Felicity dies. Before Austin can kill him, Dr. Evil suggests Austin use the time machine to save both Felicity and the world. Austin travels ten minutes into the past, meeting up with himself and saving the world and Felicity. Dr. Evil initiates the self-destruct mechanism of the moon base and escapes after throwing Austin's mojo into the air. Both Austins fail to catch it and it is destroyed. Felicity points out that all the things Austin has done show that he never lost his mojo. They escape through the time portal to 1999.\n\nAt Austin's pad, Fat Bastard makes another attempt to assassinate Austin, but Felicity disarms him. Felicity and Austin throw a party. In 1969, Dr. Evil recovers Mini-Me from space and vows revenge. On ''The Jerry Springer Show'', Scott learns he is the love child of Dr. Evil and Frau Farbissina. Austin returns to his pad to discover Felicity with the past Austin, who claims that since he and Austin are the same person, it is not cheating.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Mike Myers]] as [[Austin Powers (character)|Austin Powers]], [[Dr. Evil]] and [[Fat Bastard]]\n* [[Heather Graham]] as [[Felicity Shagwell]]\n* [[Michael York]] as [[Basil Exposition]]\n* [[Robert Wagner]] as Number 2\n* [[Rob Lowe]] as Young Number 2\n* [[Mindy Sterling]] as [[Frau Farbissina]]\n* [[Seth Green]] as Scott Evil\n* [[Verne Troyer]] as [[Mini-Me]]\n* [[Elizabeth Hurley]] as [[Vanessa Kensington]]\n* [[Gia Carides]] as Robin Spitz-Swallows\n* [[Will Ferrell]] as [[Mustafa (Austin Powers)|Mustafa]]\n* [[Oliver Muirhead]] as British Colonel\n* [[Clint Howard]] as Johnson Ritter\n* [[Kristen Johnston]] as Ivana Humpalot\n* [[Jeff Garlin]] as [[Cyclops]]\n* [[Michael McDonald (comedian)|Michael McDonald]] as [[NATO]] Soldier\n* [[Burt Bacharach]] as Himself\n* [[Elvis Costello]] as Himself\n* [[Jerry Springer]] as Himself\n* [[Steve Wilkos]] as Himself\n* [[Rebecca Romijn]] as Herself\n* [[Woody Harrelson]] as Himself\n* [[Charles Napier (actor)|Charles Napier]] as General Hawk\n* [[Tim Robbins]] as Richard Nixon (The President)\n* [[Willie Nelson]] as Himself\n* [[Kevin Durand]] as Bazooka Marksman Joe\n* [[Fred Willard]] as Mission Commander\n* [[David Koechner]] as Co-Pilot\n* [[Tony Jay]] as the Narrator\n* [[Rachel Wilson]] as Woody Harrelson fan\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n\n===Title censorship===\nThere were two variations of the posters; one of them asterisked out the middle of the offending word \"shag\".{{citation needed|date=September 2021}} Other posters had named the film as ''Austin Powers 2''.<ref name=Breznican>{{cite news|last1=Breznican|first1=Anthony|title=Translators tackle 'Austin Powers' lexicon|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=110&dat=19990621&id=B9ILAAAAIBAJ&pg=4610,8768698|access-date=18 August 2017|publisher=Ludington Daily News|date=21 June 1999|location=Ludington, Michigan|page=9}}</ref> According to the ''[[Collins English Dictionary]]'', the use of the word \"shag\" in the film's title helped to increase the word's acceptability, reducing its shock value and giving it a more jocular, relaxed connotation.<ref>{{cite web|title=shag3|url=http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/shag#shag__19|website=Collins Dictionary.com|access-date=28 August 2016|archive-date=August 26, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160826052803/http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/shag#shag__19|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nSingapore considered changing  the title to ''The Spy Who Shioked Me'' (''shiok'' derives from the [[Malay language|Malay]] word, ''syok'', which means, \"to feel good\").<ref name=Breznican/>\n\n==Release==\n''The Spy who Shagged Me'' was a hit at the box office, landing the top position in its opening weekend grossing $54.9 million, more than the entire gross of its predecessor (the first sequel to achieve this), setting a record for a June opening and the biggest opening ever for a comedy.<ref name=\"articles.latimes.com\"/><ref>{{cite news|title= 'Austin' Sequel Is Behaving Very Well At Box Office|work= The New York Times|date=June 14, 1999|url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F60C1EFE385C0C778DDDAF0894D1494D81|access-date=November 5, 2010|first=Bernard|last=Weinraub}}</ref><ref name=mile>{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Daily Variety]]|date=September 8, 1999|page=A1|title=Variety's Summer Cup: Milestones}}</ref> The film grossed $312 million worldwide.<ref name=mojo>{{mojo title|austinpowers2}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n{{See also|List of accolades received by the Austin Powers franchise}}\nOn [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film has an approval rating of 52% based on 90 reviews, with an average rating of 6/10.
