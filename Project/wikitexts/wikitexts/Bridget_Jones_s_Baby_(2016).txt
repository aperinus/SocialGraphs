It is the third film in the [[Bridget Jones (film series)|franchise]] and a [[sequel]] to the 2004 film ''[[Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason (film)|Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason]]''. The film once again stars [[Ren\u00e9e Zellweger]] as the lovable singleton Bridget Jones, who is shocked when she finds out she is pregnant. However, it's a bumpy road to the birth as Bridget must deduce which of her two recent loves is the father, reserved lawyer Mark Darcy ([[Colin Firth]], also reprising his role) or charming mathematician Jack Qwant ([[Patrick Dempsey]]), all while trying to hide one from the other.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/2016/09/16/renee-zellweger-in-bridget-joness-baby-review/|title=Bridget Jones's Baby review - Ren\u00e9e Zellweger kooks up a storm|newspaper=The Telegraph|date=16 September 2016|access-date=2016-09-19|last1=Robey|first1=Tim}}</ref> The film marked Zellweger's return to the screen after a six-year hiatus.\n\n[[Principal photography|Filming]] began on 2 October 2015 in London. The film was released theatrically on 16 September 2016 in the United Kingdom and United States and on 5 October in France. A critical and commercial success, the film received generally positive reviews and grossed over $211 million worldwide on a budget of $35 million. A [[sequel]] is in development.<ref name=\"MadAboutTheBoy\" />\n\n==Plot==\nOn her forty-third birthday, Bridget Jones attends the memorial of her ex, Daniel Cleaver, presumed dead after a plane crash. She sees her other ex, Mark Darcy, with his wife Camilla.\n\nBridget now works as a television producer and is close friends with coworker Miranda. After spending the night of her birthday alone, Bridget decides to embrace single life, accepting Miranda's offer to go to a music festival where she meets Jack, a handsome man, after she falls into some mud. Later that evening a drunk Bridget crawls into his [[yurt]], thinking it's hers and Miranda's. He invites her to stay and they have a [[one-night stand]]. In the morning, waking alone, Bridget leaves, unaware Jack is out getting breakfast for them both.\n\nReturning home, Bridget goes to her friend Jude's new baby's christening, where she is the godmother and Mark has been asked to be the godfather at the last minute. He tells her he and his wife are divorcing and Camilla was only at the funeral for moral support. Realising they are still in love, Bridget and Mark spend the night together. Mark is travelling for work early the next day, so Bridget exits before he wakes up, leaving a note telling him that she fears reconnecting will repeat their past mistakes.\n\nWeeks later, Bridget discovers she is [[pregnant]]. She decides she wants to keep the baby despite being single. After a visit to the clinic of Dr. Rawlings, she realises the father could be Mark or Jack. She is unable to contact Jack until Miranda spots him in a TV ad and discovers he is Jack Qwant, a billionaire mathematician, creator of a dating website.\n\nMiranda and Bridget conspire to have Jack as a guest on their news show to get DNA samples to work out if Jack is the father. Although Bridget tries to stay incognito, he recognises her and asks her why she left after their night together. She apologises, blurting out that she is pregnant, implying he is the father, without mentioning Mark. Initially taken aback, Jack later throws himself into the role of father. Bridget also tells Mark the news; he is so thrilled at the prospect that she cannot bear to tell him about Jack. Dr. Rawlings tries to administer an [[amniocentesis]] DNA test, but Bridget decides not to go ahead with it while her child is still in the womb as she fears the risk of miscarriage.\n\nBridget invites Jack to a work event, and is startled when Mark shows up as well. They meet, and the three go out to dinner, where Bridget finally admits that she is unsure who the father is. Although disappointed, Jack takes the news well, but Mark is upset and walks out, though he eventually becomes supportive as well. Mark and Jack eventually become jealous of each other\u2019s bond with Bridget and try to one up each other.\n\nThey pretend to be in a gay relationship to avoid embarrassment when the trio attend prenatal classes, which irritates Mark. He becomes increasingly more envious of Bridget and Jack's close relationship and is devastated when Jack lets Mark believe he and Bridget had sex without condoms, making it more likely for Jack to be the father. Mark leaves, ignoring Bridget's calls. Jack asks her to move in with him, but he eventually confesses to Bridget what he told Mark. Upset, Bridget rushes to tell Mark, but seeing his wife arriving at his house, she walks away.\n\nNine months into her pregnancy, Bridget finds herself locked out in the rain. Mark arrives and breaks into the flat for her. He tells her his wife was at the flat to pick up the last of her things. Just as they are about to kiss, her water breaks. When his mobile rings, Mark romantically throws it out the window, leaving them without a means to call help. They eventually make it to the hospital with some help from Gianni and Jack. Later Jack apologises to Mark for his behaviour. Bridget gives birth to a healthy baby boy, and her friends and parents come to visit them. Dr. Rawlings takes Mark and Jack away to perform the DNA test, and they genuinely wish each other luck.\n\nA year later, Bridget marries Mark, and it is revealed he is the baby's father. Jack is a guest, showing no sign of resentment or jealousy, happily playing with Bridget and Mark's son William. Bridget expresses her contentment that everything worked out. The film ends with a newspaper headline revealing Daniel Cleaver has been found alive.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Ren\u00e9e Zellweger]] as [[Bridget Jones]]\n* [[Colin Firth]] as Mark Darcy, [[Queen's Counsel|QC]]\n* [[Patrick Dempsey]] as Jack Qwant\n* [[Jim Broadbent]] as Colin Jones, Bridget's father\n* [[Gemma Jones]] as Pamela Jones, Bridget's mother\n* [[Sally Phillips]] as Sharon \"Shazzer\"\n* [[James Callis]] as Tom\n* [[Shirley Henderson]] as Jude \n* [[Julian Rhind-Tutt]] as Fergus, Shazzer's husband\n* [[Ben Willbond]] as Giles, Jude's husband\n* [[Sarah Solemani]] as Miranda, Bridget's  friend and Hard News's anchorwoman\n* [[Neil Pearson]] as Richard Finch, Bridget's colleague\n* [[Kate O'Flynn]] as Alice Peabody, Hard News's  manager\n* [[Joanna Scanlan]] as Cathy, Hard News's make-up artist\n* [[Emma Thompson]] as Doctor Rawlings\n* [[Celia Imrie]] as Una Alconbury, Pamela's friend\n* [[James Faulkner (actor)|James Faulkner]] as Uncle Geoffrey, Una's husband\n* [[Enzo Cilenti]] as Gianni, the owner of an Italian restaurant\n* [[Jessica Hynes]] as Magda, Bridget's friend and a lawyer's wife\n* [[Dolly Wells]] as Woney, Bridget's old friend\n* Agni Scott as Camilla, Mark's former wife\n* Shirley Dixon as Geraldine Darcy, Mark's mother\n* [[Donald Douglas (Scottish actor)|Donald Douglas]] as Admiral Darcy, Mark's father\n* [[Nick Mohammed]] as Ariyaratna, the Area manager for DTC technological solutions\n* [[Patrick Malahide]] as George Wilkins, foreign minister\n* [[Katia Elizarova]] as Glamorous Looking Woman, ex-girlfriend of Daniel Cleaver\n* [[Tom Rosenthal (actor)|Tom Rosenthal]] as Josh, a researcher of Hard News\n* [[Beattie Edmondson]] as Laura, young assistant of Bridget\n* [[Laura Checkley]] as Susan, floor manager of Hard News\n* [[Darren Boyd]] as Jeremy\n* Bruce Wang as General Lu Tong\n* Chooye Bay as General Lu Tong's driver\n* [[Janet Henfrey]] as Mavis Enderbury\n* Rafferty Railton as Spike, Shazzer and Fergus' son\n* Abigail Kimber as Ruby, Shazzer and Fergus' daughter\n* Amy Jayne as Poppy, Jude and Giles' daughter\n* [[Ed Sheeran]] as himself\n* [[Good Morning Britain (2014 TV programme)|Erron Gordon]] as Hard News director\n* [[Ashley McGuire]] as midwife\n}}\n\n==Production==\nIn July 2009, ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' announced that a third ''[[Bridget Jones's Diary|Bridget Jones]]'' film was in the early stages of development.
