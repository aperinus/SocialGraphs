It is a [[remake]] of [[The Mummy (1932 film)|the 1932 film of the same name]], starring [[Brendan Fraser]], [[Rachel Weisz]], [[John Hannah (actor)|John Hannah]] and [[Arnold Vosloo]] in the title role as the [[Mummy (monster)|reanimated mummy]]. The film follows adventurer Rick O'Connell as he travels to Hamunaptra, the City of the Dead, with a librarian and her older brother, where they accidentally awaken [[Imhotep]], a cursed high priest with supernatural powers.\n\nDevelopment of the film took years, with multiple screenplays and directors attached. In 1997, Stephen Sommers successfully pitched his version of a more adventurous and romantic take on the source material. Principal photography took place in Morocco and the United Kingdom; the crew endured dehydration, sandstorms, and snakes shooting on location in the Sahara desert. [[Industrial Light & Magic]] provided many of the visual effects, blending live-action footage and [[computer-generated imagery]] to create the titular monster. [[Jerry Goldsmith]] provided the orchestral score.\n\n''The Mummy'' was theatrically released on May 7, 1999. Despite mixed reviews from critics, it was a commercial success and grossed over $416.4 million worldwide against a production budget of $80 million. The film's success spawned two direct sequels, ''[[The Mummy Returns]]'' (2001) and ''[[The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor]]'' (2008). It also led to spinoffs such as an [[The Mummy (TV series)|animated series]] and the [[prequel]] ''[[The Scorpion King]]'' (2002), which generated its own sequels. Attempts to reboot the property and kickstart a new media franchise led to a [[The Mummy (2017 film)|2017 film]].\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- A plot summary serves as an overview of the film's events. Please see WP:FILMPLOT for more info. The word count of a plot summary is usually 400\u2013700 words. -->\nIn [[Thebes, Egypt]], 1290 BC, high priest [[Imhotep (The Mummy)|Imhotep]] has an affair with Anck-su-namun, the mistress of [[Pharaoh]] Seti I. They kill the Pharaoh after he discovers their relationship. Imhotep flees, while Anck-su-namun kills herself, believing he can resurrect her. He and his priests steal her corpse and travel to Hamunaptra, the city of the dead. The resurrection ritual is stopped by Pharaoh's bodyguards, the [[Medjay|Medjai]]. Imhotep is buried alive with flesh-eating [[Scarabaeus sacer|scarab beetles]] and locked in a [[sarcophagus]] at the feet of a statue of the Egyptian god [[Anubis]]. The Medjai are sworn to prevent Imhotep's return.\n\nIn 1923 AD, [[List of The Mummy (film series) characters#Jonathan Carnahan|Jonathan Carnahan]] presents his sister [[List of The Mummy (film series) characters#Evelyn Carnahan|Evelyn]]\u2014a librarian and aspiring [[Egyptology|Egyptologist]]\u2014with an intricate box and map that lead to Hamunaptra. Jonathan reveals he stole the box from an American adventurer, [[Rick O'Connell]], who discovered the city while in the [[French Foreign Legion]]. Evelyn and Jonathan find Rick and make a deal with him to lead them to the city.\n\nRick guides Evelyn and her party to the city, encountering a band of American treasure hunters led by Rick's cowardly acquaintance [[List of The Mummy (film series) characters#Beni Gabor|Beni Gabor]]. Despite being warned to leave by Ardeth Bay, leader of the Medjai, the two expeditions continue their excavations. Evelyn searches for the Book of Amun-Ra, made of pure gold. Instead of finding it, she stumbles upon Imhotep's remains. The team of Americans, meanwhile, discover the black [[Book of the Dead]], accompanied by [[canopic jar]]s carrying Anck-su-namun's preserved organs.\n\nAt night, Evelyn reads from the Book of the Dead aloud, accidentally awakening Imhotep. The expeditions return to Cairo, and Imhotep follows them with the help of Beni, who has agreed to serve him. He regenerates his full strength by killing the members of the American expedition and brings the [[Plagues of Egypt|ten plagues]] back to Egypt.\n\nRick, Evelyn, and Jonathan meet Ardeth at a museum, who hypothesizes that Imhotep wants to resurrect Anck-su-namun by sacrificing Evelyn. She believes that if the Book of the Dead brought Imhotep back to life, the Book of Amun-Ra can kill him again and deduces the book's whereabouts in Hamunaptra. Imhotep corners the group with an army of slaves. Evelyn agrees to accompany him if he spares the rest of the group. Although Imhotep does not honor his word, Rick and the others fight their way to safety.\n\nImhotep, Evelyn, and Beni return to Hamunaptra, pursued by Rick, Jonathan, and Ardeth, who are able to locate the Book of Amun-Ra. Imhotep prepares to sacrifice Evelyn, but she is rescued after a battle with Imhotep's mummified priests. Evelyn reads from the Book of Amun-Ra, making Imhotep mortal, and he is fatally wounded by Rick.\n\nBeni accidentally sets off a booby trap while looting the city of its riches, and is killed by a swarm of flesh-eating scarabs as Hamunaptra collapses into the sand. Ardeth bids Rick, Evelyn, and Jonathan goodbye, and the trio rides away on a pair of camels laden with Beni's treasure.\n\n==Cast==\n{{multiple image\n   | direction = vertical\n   | width     = 150\n   | footer    = [[Brendan Fraser]] and [[Rachel Weisz]] star in the film as Rick O'Connell and Evelyn Carnahan\n   | image1    = 7.27.08BrendanFraser.jpg\n   | alt1      =\n   | caption1  =\n   | image2    = Rachel Weisz Cannes 2015 2.jpg\n   | alt2      =\n   | caption2  =\n}}\n{{See also|List of The Mummy (film series) characters}}\n* [[Brendan Fraser]] as [[Rick O'Connell]]\n* [[Rachel Weisz]] as [[List of The Mummy (film series) characters#Evelyn Carnahan|Evelyn Carnahan]]\n* [[John Hannah (actor)|John Hannah]] as [[List of The Mummy (film series) characters#Jonathan Carnahan|Jonathan Carnahan]]\n* [[Arnold Vosloo]] as [[Imhotep (The Mummy)|Imhotep]]\n* [[Kevin J.

Romero]] wrote a [[film treatment]], and was attached to direct. Screenwriter Abbie Bernstein recalled that [[Universal Pictures|Universal Studios]] wanted an unstoppable Mummy akin to [[Terminator (character)|the Terminator]]. Bernstein's story took place in the present; scientists inadvertently bring a mummy to life, who wants to use an ancient device to destroy all life on earth. \"[The Mummy] had no more social interaction than the T-Rex did in ''[[Jurassic Park (film)|Jurassic Park]]'',\" Bernstein recalled. Romero drifted away from the project and the script was abandoned.<ref name=\"cinefantastique_v31n6\"/>{{rp|29}}\n\nNext, Jacks and Daniel recruited horror filmmaker/writer [[Clive Barker]] to direct. Barker's 1990 treatment and a successive 1991 screenplay by [[Mick Garris]] were dark and violent, with the story revolving around an art museum that rebuilds an entire Egyptian tomb in [[Beverly Hills, California|Beverly Hills]].<ref name=\"Cinescape\"/><ref name=\"Slotek\">{{cite news|last=Slotek|first=Jim|title=Unwrapping ''The Mummy''| newspaper=[[Toronto Sun]]|date=May 2, 1999}}</ref><ref name=\"cinefantastique_v31n6\"/>{{rp|29}} Jacks recalls that Barker's take was \"dark, sexual and filled with mysticism\",<ref name=\"Hobson\"/> and that, \"it would have been a great low-budget movie\".<ref name=\"Slotek\"/> Barker recalled the concept was too weird for the studio, and that his vision treated the Mummy as a jumping-off point for the film instead of the central character.<ref name=\"cinefantastique_v31n6\"/>{{rp|30}}\n\n[[Alan Ormsby]], unaware of the previous efforts to launch the film, was brought on next. Ormsby pitched a more straightforward update to the 1932 film, again focusing on the Mummy as a relentless Terminator-like character. [[Joe Dante]] was attached as director, increasing the budget for his idea of [[Daniel Day-Lewis]] as a brooding Mummy.<ref name=\"Hobson\"/> This version's draft was later re-written by [[John Sayles]]. It was set in contemporary times and focused on reincarnation with elements of a love story.<ref name=\"Slotek\"/> It came close to being made\u2014with some elements like the flesh-eating scarabs making it to the final product<ref name=\"Cinescape\"/>\u2014but Universal balked at the higher price tag.<ref name=\"cinefantastique_v31n6\"/>{{rp|30}}\n\nGeorge A. Romero returned to the project in 1994<ref name=\"cinefantastique_v31n6\"/>{{rp|30}} with a vision of a zombie-style horror film similar to ''[[Night of the Living Dead]]'', but which also relied heavily upon elements of tragic romance and ambivalence of identity. Romero completed a draft in October 1994, co-written with Ormsby and Sayles, that revolved around female archaeologist Helen Grover and her discovery of the tomb of Imhotep, an Egyptian general who lived in the time of [[Ramesses II]].<ref name=\"Hobson\"/> Unfolding in a nameless American city in modern times, events are set into motion when Imhotep inadvertently awakens as a result of his body having been exposed to rays from an MRI scan in a high-tech forensic archaeology lab.<ref name=\"Hobson\"/>\n\nHelen finds herself drawn into a tentative relationship with Imhotep while also experiencing clairvoyant flashbacks to a previous life in the [[Nineteenth Dynasty of Egypt]] as a priestess of [[Isis]]. Summoning mystical powers through incantation, Imhotep later resurrects the mummy of Karis, a loyal slave. Karis embarks on a vengeful rampage against the grave robbers of his tomb. Romero's script was considered too dark and violent by Jacks and the studio, who wanted a more accessible picture. Romero was unable to extricate himself from another contract he had in negotiation with MGM, and so his involvement with the film was severed and the development of an entirely new script was commissioned.<ref name=\"Hobson\"/>\n\n[[Mick Garris]] returned in 1995, developing a script that combined elements of the 1932 film and 1942's ''[[The Mummy's Tomb]]''. This draft was a [[period piece]] awash in Egyptian art-inspired [[Art Deco]], but the vision once again proved too expensive for the studio and was discarded for a modern setting. While the project came close to entering production, Universal was sold to [[Seagram]]. Sheinberg chose to produce ''The Mummy'' through his independent company and write a new script. Unable to find a suitable high-profile writer and director ([[Wes Craven]] was offered the film but turned it down<ref name=\"Slotek\"/>) the project unraveled again, and Garris left the project for the second time.<ref name=\"cinefantastique_v31n6\"/>{{rp|30\u201331}}<ref name=\"Chase\">{{cite news|last=Chase|first=Donald|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1999-may-03-ca-33434-story.html|title=What Have They Unearthed?|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=May 3, 1999|access-date=September 4, 2019}}</ref>\n\nStill determined to create a new ''Mummy'' film, in 1996 Universal hired [[Kevin Jarre]] to write a new screenplay. According to Jacks, the executives were now convinced the film should be a larger-budget period piece.<ref name=\"cinefantastique_v31n6\"/>{{rp|31}} [[Stephen Sommers]] called Jacks and Daniel in 1997 with his vision of ''The Mummy'' \"as a kind of [[Indiana Jones]] or ''[[Jason and the Argonauts (1963 film)|Jason and the Argonauts]]'' with the mummy as the creature giving the hero a hard time\".<ref name=\"Hobson\"/> Sommers had seen the original film when he was eight, and wanted to recreate the things he liked about it on a bigger scale.<ref name=\"Snead\">{{cite news|last=Snead|first=Elizabeth|title=Updating A Well-Preserved Villain|newspaper=[[USA Today]]|date=May 7, 1999}}</ref> Discussing other classic horror characters, Sommers recalled that \"''Frankenstein'' made me sad\u2014I always felt sorry for him. ''Dracula'' was kind of cool and sexy. But ''The Mummy'' just plain scared me.\" He had wanted to make a ''Mummy'' film, but other writers or directors were always attached.<ref name=\"starlog_n263\"/>{{rp|52}}\n\nAfter the box office disappointment of ''[[Babe: Pig in the City]]'' and other films, Universal needed a hit film. At the time, Universal's management had changed in response to the box office failures, and the losses led the studio to revisit its successful franchises from the 1930s.<ref>{{cite magazine|first=Liane |last=Bonin |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,84361,00.html |title=That's a Wrap |magazine=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |date=May 7, 1999 |access-date=April 1, 2008 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081220235235/http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0%2C%2C84361%2C00.html |archive-date=December 20, 2008}}</ref> New chair [[Stacey Snider]] distributed packets detailing the studio's holdings\u2014including nearly 5,000 old scripts and films.<ref name=\"raftery_2020\"/>{{rp|156}} Sommers received his window of opportunity and pitched his ''Mummy'' to Universal with an 18-page treatment.<ref name=\"Cinescape\"/>\n\nSommers did not want to remake the original film; instead of making another straight horror movie, he wanted to turn it into a romantic adventure with horror elements.

ILM was eager for the challenge the film provided, and produced a proof of concept for ''The Mummy''{{'}}s effects in late 1997 to demonstrate the feasibility of Sommers' vision to executives.<ref name=\"cinefex_n77\"/>{{rp|103}}\n\nThe filmmakers sought to make something faster and scarier for the title creature, using cutting-edge techniques to create something never before seen.<ref name=\"cinefex_n77\"/> ILM started developing the look of the Mummy three months before filming started.<ref name=\"behind\"/> \"We wanted to create a photorealistic corpse that was obviously not a man in a suit, obviously not an animatronic, and obviously alive,\" he recalled.<ref name=\"cinefantastique_v31n6\"/>\n\nOver a months-long period, the designers worked on developing four distinct stages for the Mummy. Stage one was the mummy at its most decayed, with tattered bits of clothing, skin, and sinew hanging over a skeleton. Stage two added areas of regenerated skin, with stages three and four having the Mummy almost fully regenerated with only small areas of its innards showing through. The artists developed black-and-white sketches, then moved on to color treatments before building the creature in the computer; models were also made to use as reference for the digital artists.<ref name=\"cinefex_n77\"/>{{rp|103}}\n\nThe initial states of the Mummy were created entirely by computer, while later stages combined live-action performance. To supplement prosthetics and makeups applied on set, LED lights and pieces of tape served as tracking points so that digital \"cutouts\" could be applied to Vosloo's face and body in postproduction;<ref name=\"americancinematographer_1999-08-01\"/>{{rp|61}} Vosloo remarked that walking around the set he felt like a [[Christmas tree]].<ref name=\"ew_1999-05-14\"/>\n\nThe final creature was created with a combination of live-action acting with prosthetics and digital imagery.<ref name=\"starlog_n263\"/>{{rp|55}} A digital representation of the Mummy was created in [[Autodesk Alias|Alias]], featuring simulated muscles for much of the body attached to a skeleton.<ref name=\"americancinematographer_1999-08-01\"/>{{rp|60}} The animators controlled parts of the Mummy via procedural animation; animating the underlying bones in turn controlled the stretch and movement of the overlaid muscles. Finally, layered on top of the procedural animation and [[motion capture]] was additional animation to tweak the performance; given the limitations of the technology, subtle movements like facial or hand animations had to be done by hand.<ref name=\"americancinematographer_1999-08-01\"/>{{rp|61}} Shots that featured Vosloo with overlaid computer-generated prosthetics were the most difficult for the effects team, requiring careful match-moving.<ref name=\"cinefex_n77\"/>{{rp|114}}\n\nRather than using a stunt performer, Vosloo performed the motion capture for the character himself.<ref name=\"americancinematographer_1999-08-01\"/>{{rp|61}} Scenes were blocked out and performed on set during principal photography (first with Vosloo in the scene, then without). The shots were then replicated in the motion capture studio, with Vosloo's performance recorded by eight cameras from different angles.<ref name=\"cinefex_n77\"/>{{rp|111}}\n\nIn addition to the Mummy, the script called for numerous effects shots to magnify the sweeping adventure of the film. Vistas like a flashback shot of the ancient city of Thebes combined location footage shot in the desert with composited actors shot on green screen, model miniatures, [[matte paintings]], and computer-generated effects.<ref name=\"cinefex_n77\"/>{{rp|115}} The plagues Imhotep unleashes were accomplished using particle-based computer graphics, with ILM designers swapping out models of different qualities depending on how far from the camera the swarming \"insects\" were.<ref name=\"americancinematographer_1999-08-01\"/> While the film made extensive use of computer-generated imagery, many scenes, including ones where Rachel Weisz's character is covered with rats and locusts, were shot using live animals.<ref name=\"Portman\"/>\n\nAnother close-up shot used footage of anesthetized locusts attached to a stunt performer combined with extra computer-generated pests.<ref name=\"cinefex_n77\"/>{{rp|116}} Sandstorms used procedural graphics based on programs used to create tornados in ''[[Twister (1996 film)|Twister]]'', while the masses of flesh-eating scarabs used techniques developed for ''[[Star Wars: Episode I \u2013 The Phantom Menace]]''.<ref name=\"cinefex_n77\"/>{{rp|115}}<ref name=\"cinefantastique_v31n6\"/>{{rp|27}} A shot of a firestorm engulfing Cairo combined real palm trees, physical models, and matte paintings with computer-generated hail, fire, and rubble. Pacific Title/Mirage also enhanced shots with digital camera shake.<ref name=\"americancinematographer_1999-08-01\"/>{{rp|64}}\n\nThe finale involves an army of mummies coming to Imhotep's defense. Many of these mummies were created by Make-Up Effects Supervisor [[Nick Dudman]], who produced makeup, prosthetics, and animatronic effects in the film.<ref name=\"Portman\"/> Each suit came with variations for stunt moves or pyrotechnics. After principal photography, the suits were sent to ILM to scan and be modeled in the computer. Using parts of the Imhotep mummy to save time, ILM recreated the underlings digitally to add into the scenes, and used motion capture to animate them. The animators credited Fraser's ability to consistently re-enact his movements in multiple takes as saving time when it came to match the motion-captured digital mummies to the live-action fight scenes.<ref name=\"cinefex_n77\"/>{{rp|118\u2013199}}\n\n==Music==\nThe score for ''The Mummy'' was composed and conducted by [[Jerry Goldsmith]], with orchestrations provided by [[Alexander Courage]].<ref name=amg/> Goldsmith had previously scored ''Deep Rising'' for Sommers. As he reached the final few years of his career, Goldsmith was coming off a number of action and adventure films in the 1990s, from multiple [[List of Star Trek films|''Star Trek'' films]] to ''[[Air Force One (film)|Air Force One]]''. Goldsmith provided ''The Mummy'' with suitably bombastic music, with the traditional European orchestra supplemented with regional instruments such as the [[bouzouki]].<ref name=\"bond_intradanotes\">{{Cite AV media notes |title=The Mummy Original Motion Picture Soundtrack |title-link= |others= |year=2018 |first=Jeff |last=Bond |page= |type=liner notes |publisher=[[Intrada Records]] |id=ISC402 |location=}}</ref>\n\nThe opening of the film contains nearly all of Goldsmith's major themes for the score, with what music critic [[Jeff Bond]] calls an \"Egyptian theme\" reused in different configurations throughout to establish the epic settings and sense of place for Hamunaptra; a theme for Imhotep/the Mummy that is performed in an understated manner early in the film, before repeating in more forceful, brassy renditions after the Mummy has regenerated; a love theme used for both Imhotep/Anck-su-namun and Rick/Evelyn; and a heroic theme for Rick.<ref name=\"bond_intradanotes\"/> In addition to the extensive brass and percussion elements,<ref name=\"score reviews\">{{cite web|url=http://www.scorereviews.com/reviews/review.aspx?id=219|title=The Mummy (Jerry Goldsmith) Soundtrack Review|work=ScoreReviews|access-date=January 1, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080215095846/http://www.scorereviews.com/reviews/review.aspx?id=219 |archive-date=February 15, 2008}}</ref> the score uses sparing amounts of vocals, unusual for much of Goldsmith's work.<ref name=\"score reviews\"/>\n\nThe soundtrack was released by [[Decca Records]] on May 4, 1999.
