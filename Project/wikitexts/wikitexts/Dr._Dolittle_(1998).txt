The film was based on the series of [[Dr. Dolittle|children's stories of the same name]] by [[Hugh Lofting]], but used no material from any of the novels; the main connection is the titular character Dr. John Dolittle and his ability to talk to animals, although the [[List of Doctor Dolittle characters#The Pushmi-Pullyu|Pushmi-Pullyu]], a much-loved feature of the books, notably makes a very brief appearance in a couple of scenes. The first novel, ''[[The Story of Doctor Dolittle]]'' (1920) had originally and previously been filmed in 1967 as a [[Doctor Dolittle (1967 film)|musical of the same name]], which was a closer (albeit still very loose) adaptation of the book. The 1967 film was a [[Box-office bomb|box office bomb]], but became a [[Cult film|cult classic]].\n\n''Dr. Dolittle'' was a box office success,<ref name=\"mojo\" /> although it received mixed reviews from critics upon release.<ref name=\"tomatoes\" /><ref name=\"metacritic\" /> The film's success generated one theatrical [[sequel]], ''[[Dr. Dolittle 2]]'' (2001), and three films released direct to video: ''[[Dr. Dolittle 3]]'' (2006), ''[[Dr. Dolittle: Tail to the Chief]]'' (2008), and ''[[Dr. Dolittle: Million Dollar Mutts]]'' (2009).<ref>{{IMDb title|1080926|Dr. Dolittle Million Dollar Mutts}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1968, five-year old John Dolittle displays an ability to hear what [[animal]]s are saying, starting with his own [[dog]]. John asks his dog questions like: \"Why do dogs sniff each other's butts?\" and the dog's response is that it is their own way of [[shaking hands]], and John does it when meeting his new [[school principal|principal]]. His behavior horrifies his father Archer, who hires a local [[priest]] to perform an [[exorcism]] on John in order to remove the \"[[devil]]\" from him. During the exam, the dog bites and attacks the priest, resulting in Archer sending the dog away. Following this ordeal, John eventually stops talking to animals.\n\nThirty years later in 1998, John is a [[physician|doctor]] and a [[surgeon]] living in [[San Francisco]], [[California]]. He is happily married to his wife Lisa, and has two daughters, typical teenager Charisse, and nerdy Maya, who has a pet [[guinea pig]] named Rodney, and what she believes is a [[swan]] egg, which she hopes will bond with her upon hatching. A large medical company owned by Mr. Calloway seeks to buy John's practice, a deal in which one of his colleagues, Dr. Mark Weller, is enthusiastic about, though their other colleague, Dr. Gene Reiss, is skeptical about the deal due to the potential of downsizing patients and staff.\n\nJohn's family goes on vacation, while John goes back to work to see a patient, and then pick up Rodney. On his way home, he accidentally nearly hits a dog with his [[Nissan Pathfinder|SUV]], causing the dog to scold him in anger. Afterward, as John is driving to the cabin his family is staying at with Rodney in the car, Rodney starts talking to John, causing him to believe he is having a mental breakdown. John has a [[CT scan]] after animals start asking for favors when he helps a wounded [[owl]], and he then unwittingly adopts the dog he ran over, eventually naming him Lucky. John later starts secretly helping various animals, including a [[suicide|suicidal]] circus [[Bengal tiger|tiger]] named Jake, who suffers [[great cerebral vein]]. Through all this, John begins learning to re-appreciate his gift, at one point confiding to both Lucky and Mark that he has never felt excited about his work in years. However, Lisa and Mark catch him performing [[CPR]] on a [[rat]], and have him sectioned in a [[mental hospital]].\n\nBelieving his gift is a hindrance, John rejects all abnormality in his life and returns to work, but in doing so, ostracizes Maya as well, who comes to believe he dislikes her. Maya admits to Archer that she liked the idea of her father talking to animals, and John has a change of heart when he eavesdrops on the conversation. He admits to Maya that he does not like, but loves her for who she is, and encourages her to continue being what she wants to be.\n\nJohn then apologizes to Lucky, and together, they sneak Jake out of the circus and take him to the hospital to perform surgery on him, on the same night a party is going on where Calloway will buy the company. Mark and Gene catch John, but Gene tires of Mark's greedy attitude and chooses to assist John. Soon, Jake is exposed in front of everyone at the party, and they all watch as John and Gene operate on Jake in the operating theater. Archer reveals to Lisa that John's gift is real, encouraging her to venture into the theater and keep Jake calm while John and Gene discover Jake is suffering from a blood clot and successfully remove it, saving Jake's life. John then declines Calloway's offer to buy the place and officially accepts his gift of talking to animals.\n\nJohn becomes both a doctor and a [[veterinarian]] afterwards, embracing his ability to talk to animals. Maya's egg hatches into a baby [[alligator]], and the final scene shows John and Lucky walking on the street together with John talking about he's going to treat animals and people. And Lucky talking about how he wants different treatment from now on. The owl then goes after the mice.\n\n==Cast==\n===Live-action cast===\n\n* [[Eddie Murphy]] as [[Doctor Dolittle|Dr. John Dolittle]], a physician who can talk to animals.\n** Dari Gerard Smith as 5-year-old John\n* [[Ossie Davis]] as Grandpa Archer Dolittle, the father of John.\n* [[Oliver Platt]] as Dr. Mark Weller, a colleague of John.\n* [[Peter Boyle]] as Mr. Calloway, a man who seeks to buy John's practice.\n* [[Richard Schiff]] as Dr. Gene Reiss, a colleague of John.\n* [[Kristen Wilson]] as Lisa Dolittle, the wife of John.\n* [[Jeffrey Tambor]] as Dr. Fish\n* [[Kyla Pratt]] as Maya Dolittle, the nerdy daughter of John.\n* [[Raven-Symon\u00e9]] as Charisse Dolittle, the teenage daughter of John.\n* [[Steven Gilborn]] as Dr. Sam Litvack\n* [[Paul Giamatti]] (''uncredited'') as Blaine Hammersmith\n* [[Don Calfa]] (''uncredited'') as Patient at Hammersmith\n* [[Pruitt Taylor Vince]] (''uncredited'') as Patient at Hammersmith\n\n===Voice cast===\n\n* [[Norm Macdonald]] as Lucky, a dog that John adopts.\n* [[Albert Brooks]] as Jacob \"Jake\", a [[Bengal tiger]].\n* [[Chris Rock]] as Rodney, a guinea pig owned by the Dolittle family\n* [[Reni Santoni]] as Rat #1\n* [[John Leguizamo]] as Rat #2\n* [[Julie Kavner]] as Female Pigeon\n* [[Garry Shandling]] as Male Pigeon\n* [[Ellen DeGeneres]] as Prologue Dog, John's childhood pet\n* [[Brian Doyle-Murray]] as Old Beagle\n* [[Philip Proctor|Phil Proctor]] as Drunk Monkey\n* [[Jenna Elfman]] as Owl\n* [[Gilbert Gottfried]] as Compulsive Dog\n* Phyllis Katz as Goat\n* Douglas Shamburger as Pound Dog\n* [[Jeff Doucette]] as Possum\n* [[Archie Hahn (actor)|Archie Hahn]] as Heavy Woman's Dog\n* [[Tom Towles]] as German Shepherd\n* [[Eddie Frierson]] as Skunk\n* [[Paul Reubens]] as Raccoon\n* [[Royce D.
