The title refers to the [[Midnight sun#White nights|sunlit summer nights]] of [[Leningrad]] (now [[Saint Petersburg]]), the setting for the majority of the film, situated just a few degrees below the [[Arctic Circle]].\n\nThe film is notable both for the dancing of Hines and Baryshnikov and for the [[Academy Award for Best Original Song|Academy Award]]-winning song \"[[Say You, Say Me]]\" by [[Lionel Richie]] in [[58th Academy Awards#Awards|1986]], as well as \"[[Separate Lives]]\" performed by [[Phil Collins]] and [[Marilyn Martin]] and written by [[Stephen Bishop (musician)|Stephen Bishop]] (also nominated). The film was the international film debut of Isabella Rossellini<ref name=AFI/> and Taylor Hackford met his future wife, Helen Mirren, during filming.<ref>{{cite web|title=Mirren, Mirren on the Wall|author=Nancy Griffin|work=[[AARP The Magazine]]|date=September 20, 2006|url=http://www.aarp.org/politics-society/newsmakers/info-2007/helen_mirren.html}}</ref>\n\n== Plot ==\nNikolai 'Kolya' Rodchenko (Baryshnikov) is a Soviet [[ballet]] dancer who had previously defected from the [[Soviet Union]]. When the plane carrying him to his next performance in [[Tokyo]] has electrical problems and crash lands in [[Siberia]], he is injured and recognized by [[KGB]] officer Colonel Chaiko ([[Jerzy Skolimowski]]). Chaiko contacts [[tap dance]]r Raymond Greenwood (Hines), who has [[Defection|defect]]ed to the [[Soviet Union]], and gets them both to [[Leningrad]]. Chaiko wants Rodchenko to dance at the season's opening night at the [[Mariinsky Ballet|Kirov]], and Greenwood to babysit Rodchenko. To convince Rodchenko, Chaiko uses Galina Ivanova ([[Helen Mirren]]), a former ballerina who never left the Soviet Union and is an old flame of Rodchenko.\n\nAfter an initial period of racial and artistic friction, the two dancers (and defectors in opposite directions) become strong friends. When Raymond discovers that his wife Darya Greenwood ([[Isabella Rossellini]]) is pregnant, he decides he does not want their child to grow up in the Soviet Union, and together, with Rodchenko, they plan an escape with the help of Galina, who still has feelings for Rodchenko. During the escape attempt, Raymond chooses to stay behind in order to delay Chaiko, gaining time for Nikolai and Darya to get to the [[consulate]] at Leningrad. Although Raymond is captured and incarcerated, he is traded by the Soviets for a political prisoner from Latin America, and reunites with Darya and Nikolai.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Mikhail Baryshnikov]] as Nikolai 'Kolya' Rodchenko\n* [[Gregory Hines]] as Raymond Greenwood\n* [[Jerzy Skolimowski]] as Colonel Chaiko\n* [[Helen Mirren]] as Galina Ivanova\n* [[Geraldine Page]] as Anne Wyatt\n* [[Isabella Rossellini]] as Darya Greenwood\n* [[John Glover (actor)|John Glover]] as Wynn Scott\n* [[Stefan Gryff]] as Captain Kirigin\n* [[William Hootkins]] as Chuck Malarek\n* [[Shane Rimmer]] as Ambassador Larry Smith\n* [[Marc Sinden]] as Charles\n* [[Maryam d'Abo]] as French Girlfriend\n* [[Daniel Benzali]] as Dr. Asher\n\n==Production==\nThe opening ballet sequence, ''[[Le Jeune Homme et La Mort]]'', originally choreographed by [[Roland Petit]] in 1946 and performed anew by Baryshnikov and Florence Faure, was filmed at the [[Bristol Hippodrome]].<ref name=AFI/> The gentleman paging the curtain for Baryshnikov is John Randall, the theatre's technical director at the time.\n\nIn 1985, many western [[Cold War]] movies supposedly set in Russia would use locations in the Finnish capital [[Helsinki]] with an architectural style resembling [[Saint Petersburg|Leningrad]]. For ''White Nights'', a team of travelogue filmmakers from Finland, who previously had done work in the [[Soviet Union]], were hired to film a number of locations in Leningrad, such as the [[Kirov Theatre]] and the [[Finland Station|Lenin monument]], as well as a [[Chaika (car)|Chaika]] state-limousine. These scenes were then inserted into the movie, some being in-car scenes. Hackford was disappointed with critics who wrote negative reviews based on their belief that Helsinki had been used.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\nThe film was also shot in [[Finland]] (including the island of [[Reposaari]]) and [[Lisbon]], Portugal, as well as other parts of the [[United Kingdom]] including [[Elstree Studios (Shenley Road)|Elstree Studios]] and [[RAF Machrihanish]] in [[Scotland]].<ref name=AFI/>\n\nFilmmakers normally use utilized models to film the crash-landing of an aircraft as expensive as a Boeing 747. For the filming of the crash sequence of a British Orient 747 at the beginning of ''White Nights'', two different full-sized aircraft were used. \n* For shots representing the British Orient 747 while still aloft, a rebadged [[Aer Lingus]] [[Boeing 747]] performed a [[touch-and-go landing]] at [[RAF Machrihanish]]. \n* For shots representing the British Orient 747 after touchdown, the production team purchased an older [[Boeing 707]] from South America. The 707 was converted with the famous 747 hump, a painted cockpit and a small vision slit on the original cockpit, so the stunt pilots could perform the live action crash-landing. Due to the size differences, forced perspective was used to give the impression of a larger aircraft and short actors used in a brief sequence where a vehicle is almost hit.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} The 707 aircraft in question had originally been built for South African Airways (SAA) in July 1960 and registered as ZS-CKC (serial number 17928), and was retired from SAA in 1977. It was next operated by Panama World Airways as N90651, and commercially retired by same in 1981. Finally in September 1984 the aircraft was purchased by [[Columbia Pictures]] for the making of ''White Nights''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rzjets.net/aircraft/?reg=326792|title=1960 rg 9/84 Columbia Pictures destroyed in movie \"White Nights\" when made up to be a B747 1985, canx 8/16/88|website=Rzjets.net|access-date=May 29, 2022}}</ref>\n\nThe film contains an early-career performance by [[Maryam d'Abo]], later to star as a [[Bond girl]] in the [[James Bond in film|James Bond]] film ''[[The Living Daylights]]''.\n\n''White Nights'' was dedicated \"in loving memory\" to Mary E.
