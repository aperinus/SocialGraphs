Directed by [[Mark A.Z. Dipp\u00e9]], the film stars [[Michael Jai White]] in the title role, alongside [[John Leguizamo]], [[Martin Sheen]], [[Theresa Randle]], [[D. B. Sweeney]], and [[Nicol Williamson]] in his final film role. The film depicts the [[origin story]] of the title character, a murdered [[United States Marine Corps|US Marine]] who is resurrected as the reluctant leader of Hell's army. ''Spawn'' is one of the first films to feature an African American actor portraying a major comic book superhero.<ref name=\"jet-jai-first\" /><ref name=\"mic-jai-first\" />\n\nThe film was released in the United States on August 1, 1997. It received generally negative reviews and grossed $87.9 million worldwide against a production budget between $40\u201345 million.\n\n==Plot==\nUS Marine [[United States Marine Corps Force Reconnaissance|Force Recon]] Lt. Colonel and [[CIA]] operative [[Spawn (comics)|Al Simmons]] is assigned by his superior, [[Jason Wynn]], to infiltrate a biochemical weapons plant in [[North Korea]], despite Simmons' growing moral qualms with the nature of his work. Unknown to Simmons, Wynn has ordered his top assassin [[Jessica Priest]] to murder him while he is on the mission. Before Simmons dies, he is set on fire by Wynn and the flames cause the plant to explode. Simmons arrives in [[Hell]], where one of the rulers of Hell - [[Malebolgia]] - offers him a [[Deal with the Devil|Faustian deal]]: if Simmons becomes his eternal servant and leader of his army in [[Armageddon]], he will be able to return to Earth to see his fianc\u00e9e, [[Wanda Blake]]. Simmons accepts the offer and returns to Earth.\n\nUpon his return as Spawn, he learns that five years have passed since his death. Wanda is now married to his best friend [[Terry Fitzgerald (Spawn)|Terry Fitzgerald]], who is living as the stepfather to his daughter Cyan. Spawn encounters a clown-like demon named [[Violator (comics)|Violator]], sent by Malebolgia, who acts as his guide down the path to evil. Spawn also meets and befriends a young homeless boy named Zack and a mysterious old man named [[Cogliostro]], a fellow [[Hellspawn (Spawn)|Hellspawn]], who has successfully freed his soul and now fights for [[Heaven]]. Spawn learns that Wynn, is now a weapons dealer, and has developed a [[Biological agent|biological weapon]] called Heat 16. During a reception, Spawn attacks Wynn, kills Jessica, and escapes with the help of his [[necroplasm]] armor.\n\nFollowing the attack by Spawn, Violator convinces Wynn to have a device attached to his heart that will release Heat 16 worldwide if his vital signs [[flatline]] as a deterrent against assassination attempts. Malebolgia wants Simmons to kill Wynn and initiate the apocalypse. Spawn confronts Violator, who turns into his demonic form and beats him down. Cogliostro rescues him and teaches him how to use his necroplasm armor with Zack. Spawn learns that Violator and Wynn are going to kill Terry, Cyan, and Wanda.\n\nTerry sends an email incriminating Wynn to a fellow newsman. Just as the email is sent, Cyan and Wynn enter the room. Wynn destroys Terry's computer and takes the family hostage. Spawn, Cogliostro and Zack arrive and nearly kill Wynn, but Spawn extracts the device from Wynn's body instead and destroys it. With his plan foiled, Violator sends Spawn and Cogliostro to Hell, where they both battle the demon before subduing him. Spawn is then confronted by Malebolgia, and tells the demon that he will never lead Hell's army. Spawn escapes with Cogliostro just before they are overwhelmed by Malebolgia's forces. Violator, having recovered, follows them. A final battle ensues, ending with Spawn decapitating the demon with his chains. Violator's head taunts the group and threatens his return before melting and returning to Hell. Wynn is arrested, and Spawn, realizing there is no place for him in Wanda's world anymore, dedicates himself to justice rather than succumbing to his lust for vengeance and returns to the streets with Cogliostro and Zack.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Michael Jai White FD 2012 Shankbone.JPG|thumb|right|alt=|Michael Jai White]]\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Michael Jai White]] as CIA Agent [[Spawn (character)|Al Simmons / Spawn]]\n* [[John Leguizamo]] as [[Violator (comics)|Clown / Violator]]\n* [[Martin Sheen]] as CIA Director [[Jason Wynn]]\n* [[Theresa Randle]] as [[Wanda Blake]]\n* [[Nicol Williamson]] as [[Cogliostro|Nicholas Cogliostro]]\n* [[D.

The scale of the [[visual effects]] led New Line to continually increase the project's budget, which grew to $40\u201345 million \u2014 a third of which was spent on the effects. The shooting schedule was only 63 days. To cut production time by a week, Goldman lent $1 million to engage [[John Grower]]'s Santa Barbara Studios to develop the digitally produced Hell sequences.<ref name=\"Matzer\" /> The visual effects shot count increased from 77 to over 400, created by 22 companies in the United States, Canada and Japan, requiring 70 people and nearly 11 months to complete. [[Industrial Light and Magic]] (ILM) did most of the work, creating 85 shots at a cost of $8.5 million. More than half of the final effects shots were delivered two weeks before the film's debut.<ref name=\"Matzer\" />\n\nThe most difficult sequences to render in the film included the Violator, Spawn's digital cape, and some of Spawn's transformations.<ref name=\"Matzer\" /> Visual effects supervisor 'Spaz' Williams, with his previous experience of creating the T. Rex in ''[[Jurassic Park (film)|Jurassic Park]]'', was responsible for realizing the reptilian Violator. Working with [[KNB EFX Group]] over several months they created a small 24-inch reference model, as well as a full size 11-foot model for use in some of the practical shots. The small model was cut up and laser scanned, the data was then used by a team at ILM to create a digital [[Armature (computer animation)|armature]] of the creature, and to paint and give texture to the digital model. Only then could the character be animated, after which the work had to be converted to regular film stock. Further work was needed to integrate the footage with the rest of the scene, such as matching the lighting and grain of the other footage. The final shot of The Violator was delivered on July 21, 1997.<!-- NB see end of page 1 and page 2 --><ref name=\"Matzer\" /> A team at ILM supervised by Christopher Hery and Habib Zargarpour modelled, animated and rendered realistic looking robes, glass elements and a computer generated Spawn.
