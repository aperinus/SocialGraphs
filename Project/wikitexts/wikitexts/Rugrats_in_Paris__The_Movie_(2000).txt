Thanks! --> \n\n\n\nAt the wedding reception of Lou Pickles and his new wife Lulu, a mother-child dance saddens [[Chuckie Finster]] with memories of his mother, who died shortly after he was born. Realizing that he and his son miss that presence in their lives, Chas Finster starts thinking of finding a new wife. [[Tommy Pickles]]' father Stu is then summoned to EuroReptarland, a Japanese amusement park in [[Paris]], to fix a malfunctioning [[Reptar]] robot he designed for the park's stage show.\n\nThe entire Pickles, Finster and DeVille families travel to EuroReptarland, run by the ill tempered and child-hating Coco LaBouche, who is hoping to succeed her boss, Mr. Yamaguchi, as president of the Reptar corporation. When Yamaguchi tells her his successor must love children, she lies and tells him she is engaged to a man with a child. [[List of Rugrats characters|Angelica Pickles]] overhears their conversation; when discovered eavesdropping, she saves herself by telling Coco that Chas is available.\n\nCoco begins pursuing Chas with the help of her put-upon but kindhearted assistant, Kira Watanabe. Kira tells the babies the origin of Reptar, a feared monster whose gentler side was revealed by a princess. Hearing this, Chuckie decides he wants the park's [[animatronic]] princess to be his mother; he, the babies and Kira's daughter Kimi try to find her while spending the day in the park with Chas and Coco. Meanwhile, the Pickles' dog Spike gets lost in the streets of Paris in pursuit of a stray poodle named Fifi. \n\nWhile Coco wins over Chas, Chuckie remains deeply distrustful of her. At the Reptar show's premiere, Angelica informs Coco of Chuckie's wish to have the princess for his mother, prompting Coco to infiltrate the show disguised as the princess. She lures Chuckie on stage, where he is horrified to see her true identity; however, seeing his son go to Coco convinces Chas that he should marry her straight away. On the day of the wedding, Coco orders her accomplice, Jean-Claude, to keep the babies and Angelica from intervening. Kira learns of Coco's plot and threatens to tell Chas, but is thrown out enroute to the ceremony and hurries there via bicycle. \n\nJean-Claude locks the children in the warehouse where the show's robots are kept. Chuckie begins to despair that his new mother will hate him; Angelica, now feeling guilty, reveals Coco's plan and her part in it and apologizes to Chuckie. Knowing the truth, Chuckie rallies the others to stop the wedding; they hurry to [[Notre Dame de Paris|Notre Dame]] in the Reptar robot, picking up Kimi along the way. Piloting Reptar's nemesis, Robosnail, Jean-Claude pursues them, until the babies knock him into the [[Seine River]]. \n\nArriving at the church, Chuckie interrupts the wedding by screaming his first word, \"No\". Jean-Claude follows, unintentionally revealing Coco's true nature, and Chas calls off the wedding in disgust. Mr. Yamaguchi, who is in attendance, fires Coco after Angelica informs him about Coco\u2019s plan. She also rips Coco's dress when Coco knocks down the babies; humiliated, Coco flees the chapel, and Spike chases Jean-Claude away. As Chas apologizes to Chuckie for everything Coco put them both through, Kira arrives and apologizes to him for not speaking up sooner. Realizing they have much in common, Chas and Kira develop feelings for each other. Returning home, they marry and the Finsters and Watanabes (who also adopt Fifi) become a new family.\n\n==Voice cast==\n{{main|List of Rugrats characters}}\n\n===Main===\n* [[Christine Cavanaugh]] as Chuckie Finster\n* [[E.
