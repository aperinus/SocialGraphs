This made-up word is found in two [[Steve Miller (musician)|Steve Miller]] songs, \"Enter Maurice\" and \"[[The Joker (Steve Miller Band song)|The Joker]]\", the latter of which contains the line \"''Some people call me Maurice / 'cause I speak of the pompatus of love''\". [[Wolfman Jack]] can also be heard using the term in his spoken lines in [[The Guess Who|The Guess Who's]] \"[[Clap for the Wolfman]].\"\n\nThe low-budget, [[independent film]] received mostly negative reviews.\n\n== Plot ==\nThe film revolves around four friends and their relationships with women. Set to the background of upscale [[Manhattan]] bars, lofts and apartments, the guys engage in sharp banter and one-upsmanship.\n\nThe men spend much of their time trying to decipher the word \"[[pompatus]],\" from the Steve Miller song, wondering whether they are mis-hearing the lyrics: \"Prophetess\"? \"Impetus\"? \"Profitless\"? \"Impotence\"? \"Pompous Ass\"? \"Pom-pom tits\"? \"Poconos\"?\n\nThe characters, Mark, a [[psychotherapy|therapist]] ([[Jon Cryer]]); Runyon, a [[playwright]] ([[Tim Guinee]]); Josh, a [[Playboy lifestyle|playboy]] ([[Adrian Pasdar]]) and Phil, a [[plumber]] ([[Adam Oliensis]]), try (generally unsuccessfully) to sort out their troubled love-lives.\n\nMark and his girlfriend Natasha ([[Kristen Wilson]]) who met on a blind date, are hung up over moving in together. They go to apartment after apartment, never agreeing on one they simultaneously like. She is getting more and more claustrophobic, having a dream that she is a field mouse that a bird of prey with Mark's face is closing in on her. They close on a half-finished house, and Tasha bails on him.\n\nRunyon is hung up over his old girlfriend Kathryn ([[Dana Wheeler-Nicholson]]), who has moved to Los Angeles. He flies there, with the excuse of seeking a producer for his screenplay. He goes so far as to sneak into her bedroom in the middle of the night to see her. He at least has a dinner date with someone new for Friday\n\nThe womanizing Josh is hung up on Phil's sister, Gina ([[Paige Turco]]), who has an abusive husband. He meets Cynthia, single woman ([[Mia Sara]]) who he bumps into while going down a staircase. After a nice lunch he seems to genuinely like her so offers to make her dinner. Even though they have good chemistry, when Gina shows up earlier, they end up in bed together and he blows Cynthia off. He contacts Cynthia again and says he wants to go slow.\n\nPhil, who is married with children, finds himself attracted to an older English interior designer ([[Kristin Scott Thomas]]) who is coming on to him regularly. He finds out about Gina and Josh, so storms by Josh's to pick her up. He confronts the designer, telling her he can't cheat on his wife.\n\nThe film finishes with the four friends again discussing the meaning of the Steve Miller song. Mark's relationship is over; Runyon has closure; Josh for once is going to try to have a relationship; and Phil is maintaining his marriage.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Jon Cryer]] as Mark\n* [[Adrian Pasdar]] as Josh\n* [[Mia Sara]] as Cynthia\n* [[Kristin Scott Thomas]] as Caroline\n* [[Tim Guinee]] as Runyon\n* Adam Oliensis as Phil\n* [[Arabella Field]] as Lori - Phil's Wife\n* [[Paige Turco]] as Gina\n* [[Dana Wheeler-Nicholson]] as Kathryn\n* [[Kristen Wilson]] as Tasha \n* [[Charlie Murphy (actor)|Charlie Murphy]] as Saxophone Man\n* [[Jennifer Tilly]] as Tarzaan\n* [[Roscoe Lee Browne]] as Leonard Folder\n* Lianna Pai as Ling (as Liana Pai)\n* [[Renee Props]] as Flynn (as Rene\u00e9 Props)\n* [[Jim Turner (comedian)|Jim Turner]] as Dick Spellman\n* [[Fisher Stevens]] as Sitcom Star\n* [[Michael McKean]] as Sitcom Star\n* [[Angela Featherstone]] as Times Square Kisser\n* [[Richard Schenkman]] as TV Newscaster (uncredited)\n\n== Release ==\nThe film had trouble getting a distributor after its festival run, as several other male-oriented romantic comedy films were complete around the same time.  The TV series ''[[Friends]]'' had also aired by the time production completed.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/1995/film/features/spate-of-new-pix-tests-limits-of-friendship-99123525/|title=Spate Of New Pix Tests Limits Of Friendship|last=Evans|first=Greg|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=1995-12-17|accessdate=2016-03-22}}</ref>\n\n== Reception ==\n[[Rotten Tomatoes]] reports that 17% of six critics gave the film a positive review; the average rating is 3.8/10.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_pompatus_of_love/|title= The Pompatus of Love (1996)|work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|accessdate=2016-03-22}}</ref> [[Roger Ebert]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' rated it 2/4 stars and wrote, \"This is an overdirected and overedited film, in love with the technique of short cuts in which characters finish each other's sentences.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/the-pompatus-of-love-1996|title=The Pompatus Of Love|last=Ebert|first=Roger|work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]|date=1996-08-09|accessdate=2016-03-22|via=RogerEbert.com}}</ref>  John Anderson of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' wrote that the film's premise is \"ludicrous and perfect, since the film is basically about the uninvolving being obsessed with the uninteresting\".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1996-07-26/entertainment/ca-27971_1_world-war|title='Pompatus' Wrestles a World of Self-Doubt|last=Anderson|first=John|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=1996-07-26|accessdate=2016-03-22}}</ref>  Lawrence Van Gelder of ''[[The New York Times]]'' called it \"a literate, funny film about men, women and the many mysteries of love in the 1990s\".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9C05E4DD1739F935A15754C0A960958260|title=The Pompatus of Love (1995)|last=Van Gelder|first=Lawrence|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=1996-07-26|accessdate=2016-03-22}}</ref> [[Mick LaSalle]] of the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' wrote that the film, like other romantic comedy films about men, uses a stock premise that is false: men do not understand what women want.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/movies/article/FILM-REVIEW-Pompatus-of-Love-Is-for-Jokers-2965064.php|title=FILM REVIEW \u2013 'Pompatus of Love' Is for Jokers Only|last=LaSalle|first=Mick|work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]|date=1996-09-27|accessdate=2016-03-22}}</ref>\n\n=== Awards ===\n* '''Best Comedy''' &mdash; [[Worldfest - Charleston]]\n* '''Gold Award''' &mdash; [[Worldfest - Houston]]\n* '''Silver Award''' &mdash; [[Festival Internacional de Cinema]], [[Portugal]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{IMDb title|0117357}}\n* {{Rotten Tomatoes|the_pompatus_of_love}}\n\n{{Richard Schenkman}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Pompatus of Love, The}}\n[[Category:1996 films]]\n[[Category:1996 romantic comedy films]]\n[[Category:American independent films]]\n[[Category:American romantic comedy films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Richard Schenkman]]\n[[Category:1996 independent films]]\n[[Category:1990s English-language films]]\n[[Category:1990s American films]]"}]}}}}
