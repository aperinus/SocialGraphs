The film is a loose remake of the 1939 [[Frank Capra]] film ''[[Mr. Smith Goes to Washington]]'', and is directed by Laughlin under the on-screen pseudonym \"T.C. Frank\".\n\n==Plot==\nBilly Jack ([[Tom Laughlin]]) is appointed a [[United States Senate|United States Senator]] to fill out the remaining term of another senator.  It is hoped that he will quietly vote the party line, but his term in the Senate runs into trouble when he proposes a bill to fund a national youth camp which happens to be on the property where a [[nuclear power plant]] is also being proposed.  His fellow senator, Joseph Paine ([[E. G. Marshall]]), claims to oppose nuclear power but is secretly taking [[Graft (politics)|graft]] to influence his votes in favor, and moves to try to keep Billy Jack out of the way when the bill is being debated.\n\nSeeking to keep Billy out of the Senate on a day when a controversial energy bill is being voted on, Senator Paine suggests he should meet with a grassroots group that day instead. The group is working to pass a [[national initiative]] and Billy Jack becomes convinced of their cause.\n\nBilly is invited to meet with a group of [[lobbyist]]s attempting to offer him [[bribe]]s and other perks if he will vote their way. Up against a man named Bailey ([[Sam Wanamaker]]) who wields a powerful influence in his home state, Billy Jack has his political career and reputation at stake if he does not cooperate. Billy responds with anger at their threat.\n\nThe next day in the Senate, he tries to speak on the floor in opposition to the nuclear power plant. Paine responds by proposing to expel Billy from the Senate as unfit for office. Billy's assistant quits after the murder of a lobbyist, fearing for her own safety, but returns after Billy Jack is about to be expelled from the Senate, to help him learn Senate procedure in order to [[filibuster]].  Billy collapses on the Senate floor in the effort, whereupon Paine confesses to his colleagues that every word Billy spoke was the truth.\n\n==Cast ==\n* [[Tom Laughlin]] as Billy Jack\n* [[E. G. Marshall]] as Senator Joseph Paine\n* [[John Lawlor (actor)|John Lawlor]] as Dan McArthur\n* [[Lucie Arnaz]] as Saunders\n* [[Delores Taylor]] as Jean\n* [[Suzanne Somers]] as Sue\n* [[Sam Wanamaker]] as Bailey\n* [[Richard Sanders (actor)|Richard Sanders]] as Jerry\n* [[Peter Donat]] as Ralph Butler\n* [[Pat O'Brien (actor)|Pat O'Brien]] as The Vice President\n\n==Production ==\n\nAs with the two previous films in the series, Laughlin's wife [[Delores Taylor]] and daughter Teresa Laughlin reprise their roles. Julie Webb and several other supporting actors from ''[[Billy Jack]]'' and ''[[The Trial of Billy Jack]]'' return as well. Author and political journalist [[Joe Klein]] appears briefly as a reporter in the opening scene. (Klein became friends with Laughlin after interviewing him for ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' in 1975.) {{citation needed|date=February 2021}}\n\nA new version of the song \"[[One Tin Soldier]]\" (the original theme for ''Billy Jack'') sung by Teresa Laughlin is played over the closing credits.\n\n==Release ==\n''Billy Jack Goes to Washington'' was a failure, partly due to distribution problems, and it proved to be Laughlin's last film as a director.\n\nScenes featuring [[Suzanne Somers]] and William Wellman Jr. were cut from the DVD release, which is missing 40 minutes. Wellman's cut scenes had him reprising the national guardsman he played in ''[[The Trial of Billy Jack]]'', who was now on the board of the Freedom School's directors.\n\n==Reception==\n''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' wrote, \"By comparison with the spine-tingling emotionalism and technical brilliance of the Capra version, the pic is much flatter and largely devoid of performing or visual nuances. Most of the humor is gone, and the characters are thinned out, replaced with a rhetorical talkathon interspersed with a few chopsocky sequences.\"<ref>\"Film Reviews: Billy Jack Goes To Washington\". ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]''. April 20, 1977. 24.</ref> Gary Arnold of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' described the film as \"a talky, static, derivative picture that seems to run on forever,\" adding, \"Laughlin relies so heavily on the original plot and dialogue of 'Mr. Smith Goes to Washington' that one may feel a little embarrassed on his behalf. It's obvious that he's used the Capra film as a crutch rather than an inspiration.\"<ref>Arnold, Gary (May 12, 1977). \"Billy Jack: Running His Act Into The Ground\".
