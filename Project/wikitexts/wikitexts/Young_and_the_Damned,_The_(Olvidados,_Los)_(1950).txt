Bu\u00f1uel already had a script ready titled ''\u00a1Mi huerfanito jefe!'' about a boy who sells lottery tickets. However, Dancigers had in mind a more realistic and serious depiction of children in poverty in [[Mexico City]]. After conducting research, Jes\u00fas Camacho and Bu\u00f1uel came up with a script that Dancigers was pleased with. The film can be seen in the tradition of [[social realism]], although it also contains elements of [[surrealism]] present in much of Bu\u00f1uel's work.\n\nWhile widely criticized upon initial release, ''Los olvidados'' received [[Best Director Award (Cannes Film Festival)|Best Director]] at the [[1951 Cannes Film Festival]].<ref name=\"festival-cannes.com\">{{cite web |url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/4106/year/1951.html |title=Festival de Cannes: Reckless |accessdate=2009-01-14|work=festival-cannes.com}}</ref> It is now considered a staple of Latin American cinema.\n\n==Plot==\nThe film is about a group of destitute children and their misfortunes in a [[Mexico City]] slum. El Jaibo escapes [[adolescence|juvenile]] jail and reunites with the street gang that he leads. They attempt to rob a [[blindness|blind]] [[street musician]] and, failing at first, later track him down, beat him, and destroy his instruments.\n\nWith the help of Pedro, El Jaibo tracks down Juli\u00e1n, the youngster who supposedly sent him to jail. El Jaibo puts his unharmed arm in a sling, hides a rock in it and confronts Juli\u00e1n, who denies that he reported him to the police and refuses to fight El Jaibo because it wouldn't be a fair fight. As Juli\u00e1n starts to walk away, El Jaibo hits him in the back of the head with the rock. He then beats Juli\u00e1n heavily with a stick and takes his money, killing him. El Jaibo warns Pedro not to report the crime and shares Juli\u00e1n's money with Pedro to make him an [[accomplice]].\n\nPedro's mother resents her son's behavior, and shows that she doesn't love or care for him. Pedro is saddened by this, vows to start behaving better and finds work as apprentice to a blacksmith. One day, El Jaibo comes to talk with him about their secret and, unbeknownst to Pedro, steals a customer's knife from the blacksmith's table. Pedro is accused of the crime and sent to a juvenile rehabilitation program, the \"farm school,\" where he gets into a fight and kills two chickens. The principal tests Pedro by handing Pedro a 50 [[Mexican peso|pesos]] bill to run errands with. Pedro accepts and leaves with the intention to complete the errands. As soon as he leaves, he encounters El Jaibo, who steals the money. Upset that his attempt to be good was foiled again, Pedro tracks down El Jaibo and fights him. The fight ends in a stalemate, but Pedro announces to the crowd that it was El Jaibo who killed Juli\u00e1n. El Jaibo flees, but the blind man has heard the accusation and tells the police.\n\nPedro tracks El Jaibo down once again to murder him. El Jaibo [[Child murder|kills]] Pedro. While fleeing, El Jaibo encounters the police and, as he tries to run away, the police shoot and kill him. Meche and her grandfather find Pedro's body in their shed. Not wanting to get involved, they dump his body down a garbage-covered cliff. On their way, they pass Pedro's mother, who, though once unconcerned with her disobedient child, is now searching for him.\n\n== Alternate ending ==\n\nIn 2002, it was announced that an alternate ending for ''Los Olvidados'' (labeled \"the happy ending\") was discovered at the Film Warehouse of the [[National Autonomous University of Mexico]], and it would be restored digitally in order to show it to the public. On July 8, 2005, it was re-screened with the alternate ending in a few selected venues and included in subsequent DVD releases.<ref>{{cite web| last =La Jornada| title =Restrenan en pantalla grande Los olvidados, con final in\u00e9dito| date =8 July 2005| url =http://www.jornada.unam.mx/2005/07/08/a10n1esp.php| accessdate =3 October 2011| url-status =dead| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20100612102042/http://www.jornada.unam.mx/2005/07/08/a10n1esp.php| archivedate =12 June 2010}}</ref>\n<ref>{{cite web\n  | last = ABC.es\n  | authorlink = \n  | title = Los Olvidados vuelve a la vida en DVD, con final alternativo\n  | publisher =\n  | date = 12 January 2004\n  | url = http://www.abc.es/hemeroteca/historico-01-12-2004/abc/Espectaculos/los-olvidados-vuelve-a-la-vida-con-la-edicion-en-dvd-de-un-final-alternativo_963727110684.html\n  | doi = \n  | accessdate = 3 October 2011 }}</ref>\n\nAt the International Cinematographic Festival in Saltillo, Coahuila, Mexico, on February 3, 2011, the last surviving member of the cast, Alfonso Mej\u00eda (Pedro), introduced the alternative ending to the film.<ref>{{cite web\n  | last = Vanguardia\n  | authorlink = \n  | title = Un 'olvidado' en Saltillo\n  | publisher =\n  | date = 3 February 2011\n  | url = http://www.vanguardia.com.mx/unolvidadoensaltillo-643875.html\n  | doi = \n  | accessdate = 3 October 2011 }}</ref>\n\nThe alternative ending begins with El Jaibo and Pedro fighting in an abandoned warehouse. Pedro pushes El Jaibo from the roof, where he falls to his death.

Both films deal with the never-ending cycle of poverty and despair. ''Los Olvidados'' is especially interesting because although \u201cBu\u00f1uel employed \u2026 elements of [[Italian neorealism]],\u201d a concurrent movement across the Atlantic Ocean marked by \u201coutdoor locations, nonprofessional actors, low budget productions, and a focus on the working classes,\u201d ''Los Olvidados'' is not a neorealist film (Fernandez, 42).  \u201cNeorealist reality is incomplete, conventional, and above all rational,\u201d Bu\u00f1uel  wrote in a 1953 essay titled \"Poetry and Cinema.\"  \u201cThe poetry, the mystery, all that completes and enlarges tangible reality is utterly lacking\u201d (Sklar, 324).  ''Los Olvidados'' contains such surrealistic shots as when \u201ca boy throws an egg at the camera lens, where it shatters and drips\u201d or a scene in which a boy has a dream in slow-motion (Sklar, 324). The surrealist dream sequence was actually shot in reverse and switched in post-production. Bu\u00f1uel does not romanticize the characters, and even the abused blind man is revealed to have cruel habits of preying on children and selling fake elixirs. Film historian Carl J. Mora has said of Los olvidados that the director \"visualized poverty in a radically different way from the traditional forms of Mexican melodrama. Bu\u00f1uel's street children are not 'ennobled' by their desperate struggle for survival; they are in fact ruthless predators who are not better than their equally unromanticized victims\"<ref name=mora>{{cite book|last=Mora|first=Carl J.|title=Mexican Cinema: Reflections of a Society|year=1982|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley and Los Angeles|isbn=978-0-520-04304-6|url=https://archive.org/details/mexicancinemaref00mora}}</ref>\n\n== Controversy about possible plagiarism ==\nJournalist Ver\u00f3nica Calder\u00f3n, in an article published on August 14, 2010 in the Spanish newspaper [[El Pa\u00eds]], collects statements by Morelia Guerrero, daughter of Mexican journalist and writer Jes\u00fas R. Guerrero ([[Numar\u00e1n]], [[Michoac\u00e1n]], 1911-1979), in which Morelia points out that the script and the film are based on a novel written by her father, entitled ''Los Olvidados'', published in 1944, with a prologue by Mexican writer [[Jos\u00e9 Revueltas]]. The [[National Polytechnic Institute of Mexico]] (IPN) published, in December 2009, a second edition of the novel penned by Jes\u00fas R.
