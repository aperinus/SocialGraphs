Produced by [[Marvel Studios]] and distributed by [[Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures]], it is [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe films|the 12th film]] in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU). The film was directed by [[Peyton Reed]] from a screenplay by the writing teams of [[Edgar Wright]] and [[Joe Cornish]], and [[Adam McKay]] and [[Paul Rudd]]. It stars Rudd as [[Scott Lang (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Scott Lang / Ant-Man]] alongside [[Evangeline Lilly]], [[Corey Stoll]], [[Bobby Cannavale]], [[Michael Pe\u00f1a]], [[Tip \"T.I.\" Harris]], [[Anthony Mackie]], [[Wood Harris]], [[Judy Greer]], [[David Dastmalchian]], and [[Michael Douglas]] as [[Hank Pym (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Hank Pym]]. <!--Starring list is based on the film poster's billing block, with Mackie added per his placement in the film and based on talk page discussions.--> In the film, Lang must help defend Pym's Ant-Man shrinking technology and plot a heist with worldwide ramifications.\n\nDevelopment of ''Ant-Man'' began in April 2006 with the hiring of Wright to direct and co-write with Cornish. By April 2011, Wright and Cornish had completed three drafts of the script and Wright shot test footage for the film in July 2012. Pre-production began in October 2013 after being put on hold so that Wright could complete ''[[The World's End (film)|The World's End]]''. Casting began in December 2013, with the hiring of Rudd to play Lang. In May 2014, Wright left the project citing creative differences, though he still received screenplay and story credits with Cornish. The following month, Reed was brought in to replace Wright, while McKay was hired to contribute to the script with Rudd. Filming took place between August and December 2014 in San Francisco and [[Atlanta metropolitan area|Metro Atlanta]].\n\n''Ant-Man'' held its world premiere in Los Angeles on June 29, 2015, and was released in the United States on July 17, as the last film in [[Marvel Cinematic Universe: Phase Two|Phase Two]] of the MCU. It grossed more than $519 million worldwide and received positive reviews from critics, who generally welcomed the film's smaller stakes than other MCU films, as well as its cast (particularly Rudd, Pe\u00f1a, Lilly, and Douglas), humor, and visual effects. A sequel, ''[[Ant-Man and the Wasp]]'', was released in 2018. A third film, ''[[Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania]]'', is scheduled for a February 2023 release.\n\n{{toc limit|3}}\n\n==Plot==\n<!--Do NOT change the paragraph layout.

Thank you. -->\nIn 1989, scientist [[Hank Pym (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Hank Pym]] resigns from [[S.H.I.E.L.D. (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|S.H.I.E.L.D.]] after discovering their attempt to replicate his [[Ant-Man suit (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Ant-Man]] shrinking technology. Believing the technology would be dangerous if replicated, Pym vows to hide it for as long as he lives. In the present day,{{refn|name=Timeline|group=N|The events of the film are set a few months after the events of ''[[Avengers: Age of Ultron]]'' (2015).<ref name=\"/Film65Things1\" />}} Pym's estranged daughter, [[Hope van Dyne (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Hope van Dyne]], and former prot\u00e9g\u00e9, [[Darren Cross (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Darren Cross]], have forced him out of his company, [[Pym Technologies]]. Cross is close to perfecting a shrinking suit of his own, the [[Yellowjacket (Marvel Comics)|Yellowjacket]], which horrifies Pym.\n\nUpon his release from prison, well-meaning thief [[Scott Lang (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Scott Lang]] moves in with his old cellmate, Luis. Lang visits his daughter [[Cassie Lang (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Cassie]] unannounced and is chastised by his former wife [[Maggie (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Maggie]] and her police-detective fianc\u00e9, [[Jim Paxton|Paxton]], for not providing child support. Unable to hold down a job because of his criminal record, Lang agrees to join Luis' crew and commit a burglary. Lang breaks into a house and cracks its safe, but only finds what he believes to be an old motorcycle suit, which he takes home. After trying the suit on, Lang accidentally shrinks himself to the size of an insect. Terrified by the experience, he returns the suit to the house, but is arrested on the way out. Pym, the homeowner, visits Lang in jail and smuggles the suit into his cell to help him break out.\n\nPym, who manipulated Lang through an unknowing Luis into stealing the suit as a test, wants Lang to become the new Ant-Man to steal the Yellowjacket from Cross. Having been spying on Cross after discovering his intentions, Van Dyne and Pym train Lang to fight and to control ants. While Van Dyne harbors resentment towards Pym about her mother [[Janet van Dyne (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Janet]]'s death, he reveals that Janet, known as the [[Wasp (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Wasp]], disappeared into a subatomic [[Quantum Realm]] while disabling a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] nuclear missile. Pym warns Lang that he could suffer a similar fate if he overrides his suit's regulator. They send him to steal a device that will aid their heist from the [[Avengers Compound (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Avengers' headquarters]], where he briefly fights the [[Sam Wilson (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Falcon]].\n\nCross perfects the Yellowjacket and hosts an unveiling ceremony at Pym Technologies' headquarters. Lang, along with his crew and a swarm of flying ants, infiltrates the building during the event, sabotages the company's [[server (computing)|servers]], and plants explosives. When he attempts to steal the Yellowjacket, he, along with Pym and Van Dyne, are captured by Cross, who intends to sell both the Yellowjacket and Ant-Man suits to [[Hydra (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Hydra]]. Lang breaks free and he and Van Dyne dispatch most of the Hydra agents, though one flees with a vial of Cross' particles and Pym is shot. Lang pursues Cross, while the explosives detonate, imploding the building as Pym and Van Dyne escape.\n\nCross dons the Yellowjacket and attacks Lang before Lang is arrested by Paxton. Cross takes Cassie hostage to lure Lang into another fight. Lang overrides the regulator and shrinks to subatomic size to penetrate Cross' suit and sabotage it to shrink uncontrollably, presumably killing Cross. Lang disappears into the quantum realm but manages to reverse the effects and returns to the [[Macroscopic scale|macroscopic]] world. Out of gratitude for Lang's heroism, Paxton covers for Lang to keep him out of prison. Seeing that Lang survived and returned from the quantum realm, Pym wonders if his wife is alive as well. Later, Lang meets up with Luis, who tells him that Wilson is looking for him.\n\nIn a mid-credits scene, Pym shows Van Dyne a new Wasp prototype suit and offers it to her. In a [[post-credits scene]], Wilson and [[Steve Rogers (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Steve Rogers]] have [[Bucky Barnes (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Bucky Barnes]] in their custody.

However, [[Walt Disney Pictures]] was developing a film based on a similar concept, ''[[Honey, I Shrunk the Kids]]'', and although ''Ant-Man'' went into development, nothing came to fruition.<ref name=\"TheUntoldStory\" />\n\nIn 2000, [[Howard Stern]] met with Marvel in an attempt to purchase the film rights to Ant-Man.<ref name=\"HowardStern\" /> In May of that year, [[Artisan Entertainment]] announced a deal with Marvel to co-produce, finance, and distribute a film based on Ant-Man.<ref name=\"ArtisanDeal\" /> In 2003, [[Edgar Wright]] and his writing partner [[Joe Cornish]] wrote a treatment for Artisan, with Wright explaining that it revolved around [[Scott Lang]] as a burglar \"so he could have gone slightly in the [[Elmore Leonard]] route\", though Artisan wanted the film to be \"like a family thing\". However, Wright believed that the treatment was never sent to Marvel.<ref name=\"Artisan\" /> A year later, the duo pitched the film to [[Marvel Studios]]' then head of production, [[Kevin Feige]].<ref name=\"EWJan2015\" /> In April 2006, Marvel Studios hired Wright to direct and co-write ''Ant-Man'' with Cornish as part of the company's first slate of independently produced films.

Feige also stated that shooting was slated to begin sometime in 2014,<ref name=\"EW\" /> and that casting would begin towards the end of 2013.<ref name=\"IGN3\" /> In July 2013, Wright said that he and Cornish had completed the script for the film and that Marvel allowed him to delay its production so that he could complete ''[[The World's End (film)|The World's End]]'',<ref name=\"digitalspy\" /> as that film's producer [[Eric Fellner]] was diagnosed with cancer.<ref name=\"DeadlineDec2013\" />\n\nIn August 2013, after [[Joss Whedon]], director of ''[[Avengers: Age of Ultron]]'', announced that Hank Pym would not be [[Ultron]]'s creator, Wright said Ultron was never a part of the story of ''Ant-Man'',<ref name=\"sciencefiction\" /> explaining that \"just to sort of set up what Ant-Man does is enough for one movie\".<ref name=\"HuffPost\" /> Wright described ''Ant-Man'' as a [[Stand-alone sequel|stand-alone]] film but said it would fit into the larger continuity of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, explaining, \"I like to make it standalone because I think the premise of it needs time.

Wright continued, \"Suddenly becoming a director-for-hire on it, you're sort of less emotionally invested and you start to wonder why you're there, really.\"<ref name=\"WrightJun2017\" /> The majority of Wright's crew also left the project in the wake of his departure.<ref name=\"WrightJun2017\" /><ref name=\"PopePriceLeave\" /> By May 30, [[Adam McKay]] had entered negotiations to replace Wright,<ref name=\"NewDirectorsVariety\" /> but he pulled out of negotiations the next day out of respect for Wright, who he was friends with.<ref name=\"McKayOut\" /><ref name=\"McKayPodcastTHR\" /> On June 7, Marvel announced that [[Peyton Reed]] would direct the film, with McKay contributing to the film's script;<ref name=\"ReedMcKay\" /> McKay felt this was the perfect result since he would not be replacing Wright, but was able to help Rudd, who he was also friends with.<ref name=\"McKayPodcast\" /> Other directors that had been under consideration include [[Ruben Fleischer]], [[Rawson Marshall Thurber]], [[Nicholas Stoller]], [[Michael Dowse]], and [[David Wain]].<ref name=\"NewDirectorsTHR\" /><ref name=\"ThurberOut\" /><ref name=\"NewDirectorsDeadline\" /><ref name=\"ReedWain\" />\n\nLater in June, Feige stated the film was still intended to be released on the July 17, 2015, date, with production slated to begin on August 18, 2014.<ref name=\"FeigeTotalFilm\" /><ref name=\"ProductionAugustStart\" /> Feige elaborated that \"much of the movie will still be based very much on [Wright and Cornish's] draft and the DNA of what Edgar has created up to this point\", with Reed stepping in to direct and McKay reworking only parts of the script. \"[Reed] wanted to be sure that he wasn't just inheriting something or following someone else's lead. Or wasn't inheriting something that the evil studio had watered down to be something bad,\" Feige continued. \"He looked at everything, he talked with us, and he said 'Number one, I agree with the direction you're going in. And number two, I can add to it.'\"<ref name=\"FeigeIGN\" />\n\nMcKay confirmed that Rudd helped him rewrite the script, calling Rudd \"great with dialogue\", adding \"the two of us holed up in hotel rooms on the east and west coast, and I think it was like six to eight weeks we just ground it out and did a giant rewrite of the script. I was really proud of what we did, I really thought we put some amazing stuff in there and built on an already strong script from Edgar Wright and sort of just enhanced some stuff.\"<ref name=\"McKayRuddRewrite\" /> Rudd elaborated, \"The idea, the trajectory, the goal, and the blueprint of it all, is really Edgar and Joe. It's their story. We changed some scenes, we added new sequences, we changed some characters, we added new characters. If you took the two scripts and held them up together they'd be very different\u2014but the idea is all theirs.\"<ref name=\"RuddEWWriting\" /> Some additions to the film that had not been featured in Wright's version included Janet van Dyne, the quantum realm, and a fight with an Avenger.<ref name=\"ReedTHRJul2018\" /><ref name=\"McKayPodcastTHR\" /><ref name=\"ReedPolygonJul2018\" /> According to Reed, the quantum realm was the MCU's version of the [[microverse]],<ref name=\"Microverse\" /> which could not be called that due to legal reasons. The alternate name was suggested by consultant Spiros Michalakis, a quantum physicist and staff researcher at the [[California Institute of Technology]], to \"inject elements of modern physics into the script\".<ref name=\"QuantumRealmConsultant\" /> Reed also offered contributions to the revised script, as did Lilly and Stoll, who contributed ideas to help flesh out their respective characters. Lilly's character received a fuller arc and more action sequences as a result.<ref name=\"IGNSetVisit1\" /> One of the important things when joining the film for Reed was emphasizing both Hope and Janet van Dyne more, given the Wasp being \"a crucial part\" of the Ant-Man comics.<ref name=\"ReedNov2015\" /> For their efforts, McKay and Rudd were credited as additional writers of the screenplay, with Wright and Cornish credited for the screenplay and story.<ref name=\"Screenwriters/StoryCredit\" /> Wright also held an executive producer credit on the film.<ref name=\"WrightEP\" />\n\nBy the end of July, Wilson left the film because of scheduling conflicts brought on by the filming delay, and characters being played by Gerald and [[Kevin Weisman]] were cut in McKay's revised script.<ref name=\"JulyActorCuts\" /> Also, Reed indicated that in addition to Georgia, filming would take place in San Francisco.<ref name=\"ReedJuly2014\" /> The next month, Reed revealed that [[Cassandra Lang|Scott Lang's daughter]] would appear in the film,<ref name=\"Daughter\" /> and Gabriel Ferrari and Andrew Barrer were hired to make further revisions to the script.<ref name=\"FerrariBarrer\" /> Ferrari and Barrer were hired after Reed read their [[spec script]] ''Die in a Gunfight'' which Reed felt was \"really interesting\".<ref name=\"ReedPolygonJul2018\" /> [[Eric Pearson]], a member of Marvel Studios' writing program who had written the [[Marvel One-Shot]] films, did uncredited work on the film as well,<ref name=\"Pearson\" /> scripting the strip club scene and Stan Lee's cameo.<ref name=\"Pearson2\" /> After reading the revised script, Evangeline Lilly felt that the film was \"pulled\" more into the MCU than Wright's version which \"was much more in the Edgar Wright camp of films.\" She added that, while Wright's version was \"incredible\" and would have been great to film and watch, \"it wouldn't have fit in the Marvel Universe. It would have stuck out like a sore thumb, no matter how good it was. It just would have taken you away from this cohesive universe they're trying to create. And therefore it ruins the suspended disbelief that they've built.\"<ref name=\"Lilly2\" />\n\n[[Arnim Zola (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Arnim Zola]] from ''[[Captain America: The First Avenger]]'' and ''[[Captain America: The Winter Soldier]]'' was considered to make an appearance in the film, with concept art created depicting him in his robot body from the comics.<ref name=\"Zola\" />\n\n===Filming===\n[[Principal photography]] began on August 18, 2014, in San Francisco,<ref name=\"ProductionBegins\" /> under the [[working title]] ''Bigfoot''.<ref name=\"/Film65Things1\" /> Scenes were shot in the [[Tenderloin, San Francisco|Tenderloin]] neighborhood and [[Buena Vista Park]].<ref name=\"SFFilming\" /> By the end of September 2014, production on ''Ant-Man'' moved to Pinewood Atlanta Studios in Fayette County, Georgia,<ref name=\"AtlantaMagazine\" /> and [[David Callaham]] completed a rewrite of the film.<ref name=\"CallahamRewrite\" /> Filming also took place at the State Archives building in [[Downtown Atlanta]],<ref name=\"AtlFilming\" /> to double as Pym Technologies, which is located on [[Treasure Island, San Francisco]] in the film.<ref name=\"/Film65Things3\" /> In October 2014, [[Martin Donovan]] was added to the cast,<ref name=\"Donovan\" /> and Feige revealed that ''Ant-Man'' would no longer start Phase Three of the Marvel Cinematic Universe and would instead be the final film of [[Marvel Cinematic Universe: Phase Two|Phase Two]].<ref name=\"NewPhase3\" /> When told by ''[[/Film]]''{{'s}} Germain Lussier that this placement between ''Avengers: Age of Ultron'' and ''[[Captain America: Civil War]]'' made the film feel like an afterthought, Feige replied,\n{{blockquote|It's not [an after thought]. The truth is the phases mean a lot to me and some people but...''Civil War'' is the start of Phase Three. It just is. And ''Ant-Man'' is a different kind of culmination of Phase Two because it very much is in the MCU. You meet new characters and you learn about Hank Pym and his lineage with the MCU over the years. But at the same time, it also picks up the thread of ''Age of Ultron'' in terms of heroes\u2014major heroes, Avengers\u2014coming from unexpected places... And in that way it connects a lot. Also, Hank Pym's attitude towards Avengers, towards [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]], and kind of the cinematic universe in general, is much more informed after the events of ''Age of Ultron'', and in a certain way, before the events of ''Civil War''.<ref name=\"FeigePhase\" />}}\n\n[[File:Peyton Reed (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright|left|Reed at the world premiere of ''Ant-Man'' in Hollywood]]\nFeige later expanded on this by saying, \"[W]e put ''Ant-Man'' at the end of Phase Two as opposed to the beginning of Phase Three, because it sets up a lot of the things you're going to see heading into Phase Three, one of which is this mind-bending, reality-altering landscape [in ''[[Doctor Strange (2016 film)|Doctor Strange]]''].\"<ref name=\"AntManFalcon\" /> On December 5, 2014, Reed announced on social media that principal photography on ''Ant-Man'' had been completed.<ref name=\"FilmingComplete\" />\n\nFor the film, cinematographer [[Russell Carpenter]] used a 1.85 [[aspect ratio (image)|aspect ratio]] shot with [[Arri Alexa#Alexa XT|Arri Alexa XT]] and [[Arri Alexa#Alexa M|M]] cameras, using the M for fight sequences and helicopter filming. Camera operator Peter Rosenfeld said, \"Russell and Peyton's decision to shoot in 1.85 was a good call, since at 2.35 there's insufficient height in frame to appreciate the vertical aspects of [Ant-Man] going from standing full-size to falling through a crack in the floor.\" Carpenter and [[Technicolor]] also devised a [[lookup table]] (LUT) to darken the color palette. Carpenter said, \"For a lot of recent comedies I've kept my LUTs kind of '[[Kodak]]' \u2013 saturated and upbeat. But this show needed something different that affected skin tones and the Ant-Man suit, which dates back to the 1980s, so it looks a little run-down. What I loved about this LUT was how it allowed the costume to retain the color but took it from fire-engine red to something a little more weathered.\"<ref name=\"ICG\" />\n\nThe filmmakers made extensive use of [[macro photography]]. Production designer Shepherd Frankel said, \"It's more visually interesting to depict things from Ant-Man's point of view instead of seeing him from a normal perspective. But we wanted a realistic realization, not ''Honey, I Shrunk the Kids'' with its oversized set pieces.\"<ref name=\"ICG\" /> Rebecca Baehler served as the director of macro photography, taking cues from Carpenter.<ref name=\"FXGuide\" /> Carpenter said vibration became \"a tremendous problem\" when moving the camera during the macro photography because \"one inch off the ground is like fifteen feet in the air. From an ant's perspective, you move four inches, to a human perspective, that's a football field!\" The filmmakers needed a creative solution, so they turned to Baehler, who had a background in commercial \"tabletop\" photography. In order to add Rudd's performance as Ant-Man when in the macro world, a Centroid facial motion-capture set-up was used, with a five-camera array of Alexas surrounding Rudd. Rosenfeld explained, \"One camera was set up vertically while the others were horizontal with overlapping image areas, all set to record at 48 frames per second. This maximized resolution and provided 3D modeling [of] Paul's performance.\" Reed would then call out story moments with Rudd performing \"facial expressions that would later be composited on a [[computer-generated imagery|CG]] Ant-Man\".<ref name=\"ICG\" /> Entomologist [[Steven R. Kutcher|Steven Kutcher]] provided suggestions to the filmmakers on how to film live ants.<ref name=\"AntFilmingConsultant\" />\n\n===Post-production===\nFollowing the completion of principal photography, Marvel released an updated synopsis revealing that [[Jordi Moll\u00e0]] was included in the cast and the names of several supporting characters.<ref name=\"StitchCast\" /> However, Moll\u00e0 subsequently did not appear in the theatrical release of the film. Reed explained that the film's original opening, which was filmed and cut in the editing process, featured a standalone sequence similar to the opening of a [[James Bond in film|James Bond film]], where an unseen Pym was attempting to retrieve some microfilm from Moll\u00e0's character, Castillo, a Panama army general. Reed stated the scene was going to show Ant-Man's powers, without seeing him, almost \"like an Invisible Man sequence, and it's really, really cool. It started to feel tonally disconnected from the movie we were making and story-wise, and it also kind of like, it set a standalone adventure, but it didn't just connect to the rest of our story...It felt like vestige of those earlier drafts [by Wright and Cornish], which as a standalone thing was really cool.\"<ref name=\"ReedOriginalOpening\" /> Dan Lebental and Colby Parker, Jr. served as [[film editing|film editors]].<ref name=\"ProductionBegins\" /> In March 2015, [[Hayley Atwell]] confirmed that she would reprise her role as [[Peggy Carter (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Peggy Carter]] in the film.<ref name=\"AtwellAntMan\" /> In April 2015, Reed stated that the film was not completed yet and would be undergoing \"a little bit of additional\" filming.<ref name=\"AddtionalFilming\" />\n\nIn June 2015, Feige confirmed that the character of Janet van Dyne would be seen, though the film would not address Pym and Van Dyne's infamous domestic abuse storyline in the comics, saying, \"We hint at a temper in a way that people who know the stories might go, 'Oh, perhaps that's a bit of [Hank's] character,' but not in a way that would ever indicate [he beat his wife].\"<ref name=\"IGNSetVisit3\" /> Also in the month, Reed confirmed there would be a post-credit sequence \"that may tie into the other films.\"<ref name=\"/Film65Things5\" /> Feige revealed the post-credit sequence was footage shot by [[Russo brothers|Anthony and Joe Russo]] for ''[[Captain America: Civil War]]'', saying the clip would be seen in that film, though it may be \"different takes...different angles.\"<ref name=\"FeigePostCredit\" /><ref name=\"FeigePostCredit2\" /> On June 25, 2015, Reed announced on social media that production of ''Ant-Man'' was officially complete.<ref name=\"AntManComplete\" /> In early July 2015, an international teaser trailer revealed that [[Anthony Mackie]] would appear in the film as [[Sam Wilson (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Sam Wilson / Falcon]].<ref name=\"Mackie\" /> Mackie appears in the post-credit sequence as well, along with [[Chris Evans (actor)|Chris Evans]] and [[Sebastian Stan]] as [[Steve Rogers (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Steve Rogers / Captain America]] and [[Bucky Barnes (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Bucky Barnes / Winter Soldier]], respectively.<ref name=\"EvansStanAntMan\" /> Stan stated the scene that was used for the post-credit sequence was shot in May 2015, and would appear in the middle of ''Civil War''.<ref name=\"StanCollider\" /> Reed also said that the end of the film originally had a sequence where Ant-Man went after Carson to retrieve the stolen vial of Cross' particles, \"...&nbsp;But then for a couple reasons, it felt like maybe we should leave those particles out there.\"<ref name=\"ReedCinemaBlend\" /> For the title sequences, Marvel again went with design firm Sarofsky, who had done the credits for both ''Captain America: The Winter Soldier'' and ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy (film)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]'', with the credits \"intricately connected to the film's overall narrative.\"<ref name=\"Sarofsky\" />\n\n====Visual effects====\n[[File:Yellowjacket VFX in Ant-Man (film).jpg|thumb|For Yellowjacket sequences, Stoll wore a [[motion capture]] suit while on set (top), which was replaced by an entirely digital creation built by Double Negative (bottom).<ref name=\"FXGuide\" />]]\nVisual effects for the film were provided by [[Industrial Light & Magic]] (ILM), [[Lola Visual Effects|Lola VFX]], [[Double Negative (VFX)|Double Negative]], [[Luma Pictures]], and [[Method Studios]], with [[previsualization]] by [[The Third Floor, Inc.|The Third Floor]].<ref name=\"IGNSetVisit1\" /><ref name=\"FXGuide\" /><ref name=\"YoungDouglas\" /> Double Negative handled the scenes featuring shrunken characters, incorporating the macro photography and [[motion capture]] performances shot in principal photography with digital models of the characters. Double Negative also worked on Ant-Man's shrinking effect, in coordination with ILM to be used by all vendors, which showed the outline of his body \u2013 an element from the comics. Visual effects supervisor Alex Wuttke said, \"It's like a little time echo. As Ant-Man shrinks in almost a stop motion way he would leave behind outlines of the poses he'd been in as he shrinks down... We'd have two CG cameras rendering the action from different points along the timeline with slightly different framings. One would be the main shot camera, the other would be a utility camera that would provide renders of static poses of Ant-Man at different points along the timeline.\"<ref name=\"FXGuide\" />\n\nFor the flashbacks in 1989, Douglas and Donovan appeared [[De-aging in film|de-aged]] via CGI, alongside Atwell as Carter (aged in makeup and with CGI) and [[John Slattery]] as [[Howard Stark]].<ref name=\"/Film65Things1\" /><ref name=\"SHHypeSetVisit\" /><ref name=\"FXGuide\" /><ref name=\"IGNSetVisit3\" /> To de-age Douglas, Lola VFX used a similar process and technology that was used to make Steve Rogers skinny in ''[[Captain America: The First Avenger]]'' and Carter older in ''[[Captain America: The Winter Soldier]]'' as well as footage of Douglas' other films from the late 1980s as reference.<ref name=\"AntManFalcon\" /><ref name=\"YoungDouglas\" /> [[Dax Griffin]] served as Douglas' [[body double]] and an additional reference for Lola, because of his \"striking resemblance of Michael when he was about 40\".<ref name=\"YoungDouglas\" /><ref name=\"Griffin\" /> For Donovan, he only needed to be de-aged about a decade, so no double was used. The work on him focused on his eyes, neck, and chin. Atwell wore a wig on set, along with a fine layer of latex makeup to give the skin a more leathery look, with Lola transposing the facial features of an elderly actress onto her face.<ref name=\"FXGuide\" />\n\nMethod and Luma both worked on creating the various ants seen in the film, with Method creating the several species of ants, to share among the vendors. Luma also handled many of the scenes at Pym Technologies when Ant-Man attempts to acquire the Yellowjacket. ILM worked on the Falcon fight sequence, having done Falcon visual effects in ''The Winter Soldier''. Using practical suit pieces built by [[Legacy Effects]], ILM mixed live-action shots with digital take-overs and fully digital shots to create the sequence. ILM also handled the sequences in the quantum realm, providing an array of microscopic and largely psychedelic imagery for the subatomic shrinking, taking advantage of procedural fractal rendering techniques the studio had utilized on ''[[Lucy (2014 film)|Lucy]]''.<ref name=\"FXGuide\" />\n\n==Music==\n{{main|Ant-Man (soundtrack)}}\nIn February 2014, Wright announced that [[Steven Price (composer)|Steven Price]] would [[Film score|score]] the film.<ref name=\"Pope-Price\" /> However, Price left soon after Wright's departure from the project in May 2014.<ref name=\"PopePriceLeave\" /> In January 2015, [[Christophe Beck]], who worked with Reed on ''[[Bring It On (film)|Bring It On]]'', was hired to replace Price.<ref name=\"BeckToScore\" /> Describing the film's score, Beck said, \"For ''Ant-Man'', I wanted to write a score in the grand symphonic tradition of my favorite superhero movies, with a sweeping scope and a big, catchy main theme.

It explains Lang's circumstances at the beginning of the film.<ref name=\"SmallTime1\" /> A virtual [[pinball]] based on the film was released on July 14, 2015, by [[Zen Studios]].<ref name=\"Pinball\" />\n\nIn January 2015, Disney officially began the film's marketing campaign by releasing a miniature \"ant-sized\" teaser trailer, a full-sized version of the same teaser trailer, a poster, a cover on ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'', and a full-length trailer during the premiere of the television series ''[[Agent Carter (TV series)|Agent Carter]]''. Scott Mendelson of ''[[Forbes]]'', said, \"It was darn-clever for Disney to put out a miniature 'can't see anything without a microscope' version of the now-standard trailer for the trailer. I sighed just a little when they 'gave in' and released a human-sized version, realizing that Disney had just released what amounted to a teaser to a teaser to a trailer... But nonetheless, credit where credit is due, Disney was able to turn a single theatrical trailer into three separate news drops in about five days.\" Mendelson went on to say that \"the peppy, witty trailer above is a general audience sell. Marvel knows the geeks will come if only to throw stones, but it's the mainstream audience that needs to be sold. So far, so good.\"<ref name=\"ForbesTrailer\" /> However, Graeme McMillan of ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' criticized the trailer for its placement during the broadcast premiere of ''Agent Carter'', its tone, its soundtrack, and for being thematically similar to other trailers from Marvel Studios. McMillan concluded, \"The ''Ant-Man'' trailer isn't bad, per se; it is, however, impressively underwhelming, which almost seems worse. Thanks to the last-minute exit of original writer-director Edgar Wright and the subsequent struggle to find a replacement, ''Ant-Man'' has become the movie that people are expecting to be Marvel's first failure, in critical if not financial terms, at least; this trailer, which fails to convince and gets by on goodwill for those involved and the Marvel brand as much as anything else, doesn't do enough \u2014 or anything, really \u2014 to persuade audiences that that's not the case.\"<ref name=\"THRTrailer\" /> The trailer generated 29 million views worldwide in three days, the third-largest viewership for a Marvel Studios film, behind trailers for ''[[Iron Man 3]]'' and ''Avengers: Age of Ultron''.<ref name=\"EWTrailer\" />\n\nIn April 2015, Marvel debuted a second trailer for ''Ant-Man''. Mendelson said it was \"frankly the ''Ant-Man'' trailer that we've been waiting for. It's not just funny and exciting, it's an 'Ah ha!' moment when we realize just what exactly an ''Ant-Man'' movie has to offer.\"<ref name=\"ForbesAprilTrailer\" /> Also in April, miniature [[billboard]]s promoting ''Ant-Man'' with battery-powered [[Light-emitting diode|LED]] lights began appearing in [[Melbourne]], [[Brisbane]] and other areas around [[Queensland]], Australia as part of a [[street marketing]] campaign for the film.<ref name=\"billboard\" /> The next month, Marvel, in partnership with [[Dolby Laboratories]], [[Visa Inc.|Visa]], and [[Raspberry Pi]], announced the \"Ant-Man Micro-Tech Challenge\", aimed at females aged 14 through 18, to create [[Do it yourself|DIY]] projects involving micro technology and readily accessible and found materials. Winners teamed with [[STEM fields|STEM]] (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics education) programs in their areas to lead teams in recreating their projects.<ref name=\"MicroTechChallenge\" /> In June, Marvel released posters featuring Ant-Man juxtaposed with [[Iron Man's armor (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Iron Man's armor]], [[Captain America's shield#Marvel Cinematic Universe version|Captain America's shield]], and Thor's hammer [[Mjolnir (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Mjolnir]]. Mendelson compared this to Disney's marketing campaign for ''[[Lilo & Stitch]]'' that put the [[Stitch (Lilo & Stitch)|protagonist]] into iconic scenes from other Disney cartoons.<ref name=\"AvengersPosters\" /> A six-minute IMAX preview of the film began screening before showings of ''[[Jurassic World]]'',<ref name=\"IMAXPreview\" /> and scenes from the film were shown at [[Disney California Adventure]]'s [[It's Tough to Be a Bug!|Bug's Life Theater]] in 3D with in-theater effects.<ref name=\"DisneyCalifornia\" />\n\nIn early July 2015, Marvel began a [[viral marketing]] campaign featuring [[Leslie Bibb]], reprising her role from the ''Iron Man'' films as journalist [[Christine Everhart (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Christine Everhart]], reporting for the faux news program ''[[WHIH Newsfront]]''. In the program, Everhart discuses the fallout from the events of ''Avengers: Age of Ultron'', Lang's imprisonment,<ref name=\"Newsfront1\" /><ref name=\"Newsfront2\" /> and events leading to ''Captain America: Civil War''.<ref name=\"Newsfront3\" /> Also in July, Michael Douglas and executives from [[Marvel Entertainment]] rang the closing bell of the [[New York Stock Exchange]] in celebration of the release of ''Ant-Man''.<ref name=\"NYSE\" /> Disney spent $34.8 million on television advertising for the film, more than the $26.9 million spent for ''Avengers: Age of Ultron'', since the former was a new property.<ref name=\"TVMoney\" />\n\nIn December 2015, to commemorate the home media release of ''Ant-Man'', [[Marvel UK]] launched a website that offers visitors a view of various London landmarks from the perspective of an ant in a [[Google Street View]]-type experience. The company commissioned photographer Will Pearson to capture ten different locations including [[Tower Bridge]], [[Oxford Circus]], the [[British Museum]], [[St Paul's Cathedral]] and [[Nelson's Column]] using a 360\u00b0 miniature camera that sat centimeters off of the ground.<ref name=\"The360Co\" />\n\n==Release==\n===Theatrical===\n[[File:Paul Rudd (cropped) 2.jpg|thumb|upright|Rudd at the world premiere of ''Ant-Man'' in Hollywood]]\n''Ant-Man'' premiered at the [[Dolby Theatre]] in Hollywood on June 29, 2015,<ref name=\"WorldPremiere\" /> and opened the 2015 [[Fantasia International Film Festival]] on July 14, 2015, along with ''[[Miss Hokusai]]''.<ref name=\"FantasiaFest\" /> The film was released in France on July 14,<ref name=\"DeadlineRelease\" /> and was released in North America on July 17,<ref name=\"ReleaseChange\" /> in [[3D film|3D]] and [[IMAX 3D]].<ref name=\"IMAX\" /><ref name=\"ForbesAntManPoster\" /> The film was released in the United States in 3,800 theaters, with the breakdown of 3,100 3D screens, 361 IMAX screens, 388 [[Large format (photography)|large format]] screens and 133 [[D-Box Technologies|D-Box]] screens.<ref name=\"DeadlineRelease\" /> ''Ant-Man'' had originally been scheduled for release on November 6, 2015.<ref name=\"collider\" /> In September 2013, the release was moved to July 31, 2015,<ref name=\"Deadline\" /> before changing for a final time to July 17, 2015, in January 2014.<ref name=\"ReleaseChange\" /> An unfinished version of the film was screened on June 24, 2015, at [[CineEurope]].<ref name=\"CineEurope\" /> ''Ant-Man'' was the last film released in Phase Two of the MCU.<ref name=\"NewPhase3\" />\n\n===Home media===\n''Ant-Man'' was released for [[Digital distribution|digital download]] by [[Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment]] on November 17, 2015, and released on [[Blu-ray Disc|Blu-ray]], [[Blu-ray Disc#Blu-ray 3D|Blu-ray 3D]], and [[DVD]] on December 8, 2015.
