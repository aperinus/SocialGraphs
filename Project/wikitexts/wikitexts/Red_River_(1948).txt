It gives a fictional account of the first [[cattle drive]] from [[Texas]] to [[Kansas]] along the [[Chisholm Trail]]. The dramatic tension stems from a growing feud over the management of the drive between the Texas rancher who initiated it (Wayne) and his adopted adult son (Clift).\n\nThe film's supporting cast features [[Walter Brennan]], [[Joanne Dru]], [[Coleen Gray]], [[Harry Carey (actor)|Harry Carey]], [[John Ireland (actor)|John Ireland]], [[Hank Worden]], [[Noah Beery Jr.]], [[Harry Carey Jr.]] and [[Paul Fix]]. [[Borden Chase]] and [[Charles Schnee]] wrote the screenplay based on Chase's original story (which was first serialized in ''[[The Saturday Evening Post]]'' in 1946 as \"Blazing Guns on the Chisholm Trail\").\n\nUpon its release, ''Red River'' was both a commercial and a critical success and was nominated for two [[Academy Awards]].<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0040724/awards?ref_=tt_awd Red River (1948) \u2013 Awards]</ref> In 1990, ''Red River'' was selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.\"<ref>{{Cite web|title=Complete National Film Registry Listing |url=https://www.loc.gov/programs/national-film-preservation-board/film-registry/complete-national-film-registry-listing/|website=Library of Congress, Washington, DC|access-date=2020-05-08}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|last1=Gamarekian|first1=Barbara|date=1990-10-19|title=Library of Congress Adds 25 Titles to National Film Registry|language=en-US|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/10/19/movies/library-of-congress-adds-25-titles-to-national-film-registry.html|access-date=2020-08-06|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> ''Red River'' was selected by the [[American Film Institute]] as the fifth-greatest Western of all time in the [[AFI's 10 Top 10]] list in 2008.\n\n==Plot==\n\nThomas Dunson wants to start a cattle ranch in Texas. Shortly after he begins his journey to Texas with his trail hand Nadine Groot, Dunson learns that his love interest Fen was killed in an [[Native Americans in the United States|Indian]] attack. He had told Fen to stay behind with the California-bound wagon train, with the understanding that he would send for her later.\n\nThat night, Dunson and Groot fend off an attack by Indians. On the wrist of one, Dunson finds a bracelet he had been left by his late mother, which he had given to Fen as he left the train. The next day, an orphaned boy named Matthew Garth (played as a boy by [[Mickey Kuhn]]) wanders into Dunson and Groot's camp. He is the sole survivor of the wagon train, and Dunson adopts him.\n\nDunson, Groot, and Matt enter Texas by crossing the [[Red River of the South|Red River]]. They settle in deep South Texas near the [[Rio Grande]]. Dunson names his new spread the Red River D, after his chosen cattle brand for his herd. He promises to add M (for Matt) to the brand, once Matt has earned it.\n\nFourteen years pass, and Dunson has a fully operational cattle ranch, but he is broke as a result of widespread poverty in the southern United States following the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]. He decides to drive his massive herd hundreds of miles north to the [[railhead]] at [[Sedalia, Missouri]], where he believes they will fetch a good price. After Dunson hires men to help, including professional gunman Cherry Valance, the northward drive starts.\n\nAlong the way, they encounter many troubles. One of the men, Bunk Kenneally, raises a maudlin ruckus in one of the wagons, triggering a [[stampede]]. This leads to the death of Dan Latimer. When Dunson attempts to whip Bunk as punishment for causing the stampede, the latter draws his gun. Matt shoots and wounds Bunk, probably saving his life because Dunson certainly would have shot to kill. Bunk is fired and sent home. Dunson tells Matt that he is weak because he did not kill his man.\n\nContinuing with the drive, Valance relates that the railroad has reached [[Abilene, Kansas]], which is much closer than Sedalia. When Dunson confirms that Valance had not actually seen the railroad, he ignores the rumor in favor of continuing to Missouri.\n\nDunson's tyrannical leadership style begins to affect the men, with his shooting three drovers who try to quit the drive. After Dunson announces he intends to lynch two men who stole supplies, tried to desert, and were captured by Valance, Matt rebels. With the support of the cowhands, he takes control of the herd in order to drive it along the [[Chisholm Trail]] to the hoped-for railhead in Abilene. Valance and Buster become his right-hand men. Dunson curses Matt and promises to kill him when they next meet. The drive turns toward Abilene, leaving Dunson behind.\n\nOn the way to Abilene, Matt and his men repel an Indian attack on a wagon train made up of gamblers and dance hall girls. One of the people they save is Tess Millay, who falls in love with Matt. They spend a night together, and he gives her Dunson's mother's bracelet. Eager to beat Dunson to Abilene, he leaves early in the morning, the same way Dunson had left his lady love with the wagon train 14 years before.\n\nLater, Tess encounters Dunson, who has followed Matt's trail and now sees her wearing his mother's bracelet. Weary and emotional, he tells Tess what he wants most of all is a son. She offers to bear him one if he will abandon his pursuit of Matt. Dunson sees in her the anguish that Fen had expressed when he left her, and decides to resume the chase with Tess accompanying him.\n\nWhen Matt reaches Abilene, he finds the town has been awaiting the arrival of such a herd to buy. He accepts an offer for the cattle and meets Tess again. The next morning, Dunson arrives in Abilene with his posse. Dunson and Matt begin a fistfight, which Tess interrupts, demanding that they realize the love that they share. Making peace, Dunson advises Matt to marry Tess and tells him that when they get back to the ranch, he will incorporate an M into the brand, telling Matt that he had earned it.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=36em}}\n* [[John Wayne]] as Thomas Dunson\n* [[Montgomery Clift]] as Matthew \"Matt\" Garth\n* [[Walter Brennan]] as Nadine Groot\n* [[Joanne Dru]] as Tess Millay\n* [[Coleen Gray]] as Fen\n* [[Harry Carey (actor)|Harry Carey]] as Mr. Melville, representative of the Greenwood Trading Company<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tCQOwvI9vsAC&q=%22Red%20River%22%20%22Greenwood%20Trading%20Company%22%20Melville&pg=PA67|title=Film Genre: From Iconography to Ideology|first=Barry Keith|last=Grant|publisher=Wallflower|location=London|year=2007|page=67|isbn=978-1904764793}}</ref>\n* [[John Ireland (actor)|John Ireland]] as Cherry Valance\n* [[Noah Beery Jr.]] as Buster McGee (Dunson Wrangler)\n* [[Harry Carey Jr.]] as Dan Latimer (Dunson Wrangler)\n* [[Chief Yowlachie]] as Two Jaw Quo (Dunson Wrangler)\n* [[Paul Fix]] as Teeler Yacey (Dunson Wrangler)\n* [[Hank Worden]] as Sims Reeves (Dunson Wrangler)\n* Ray Hyke as Walt Jergens (Dunson Wrangler)\n* [[Wally Wales]] as Old Leather (Dunson Wrangler)\n* [[Mickey Kuhn]] as Young Matt\n* Robert M.

The solid silver belt buckles had a twisted silver wire rope edge, the Dunson brand in gold in the center, the words \u201cRed River\u201d in gold wire in the upper left and lower right corners, the initials of the recipients in the lower left corner, and the date \"1946\" in cut gold numerals in the upper right corner. Hawks gave full-sized (men's) buckles to John Wayne, his son David Hawks, Montgomery Clift, Walter Brennan,  assistant director Arthur Rosson, cinematographer Russell Harlan, and John Ireland. Joanna Dru and Hawks' daughter Barbara were given smaller (ladies') versions of the buckle. According to David Hawks, other men's and women's buckles were distributed, but he can only confirm the family members and members of the cast and production team listed above received Red River D buckles.\n\nWayne and Hawks exchanged buckles as a token of their mutual respect. Wayne wore the Red River D belt buckle with the initials \"HWH\" in nine other movies including ''[[North to Alaska]], [[Circus World (film)|Circus World]], [[Hatari!]] [[Rio Bravo (film)|Rio Bravo]], [[El Dorado (1966 film)|El Dorado]], [[McLintock!]]'', and ''[[Rio Lobo]]''.\n\nIn 1981, John Wayne's son Michael sent the buckle to a silversmith in order to have duplicates made for all of Wayne's children. While in the silversmith's care, it was stolen and has not been seen since. Red River D buckles, made by a number of sources, are among the most popular and sought after icons of John Wayne fans.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://redriverdbeltbuckle.com|title=History of the Red River D Buckle}} </ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Cimarron (1931 film)|''Cimarron'']]{{Snd}}1931 film mentioned on poster\n* ''[[The Covered Wagon]]''{{Snd}}1923 film mentioned on poster\n* [[Han shot first]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Eagan, Daniel (2010). \"''Red River'' essay\" in ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=deq3xI8OmCkC America's Film Legacy: The Authoritative Guide to the Landmark Movies in the National Film Registry]'', London: [[A & C Black]]. {{ISBN|0826429777}}, pp.&nbsp;417\u201319.\n* {{cite book |last=Pippin |first=Robert B. |title=Hollywood Westerns and American Myth: The Importance of Howard Hawks and John Ford for Political Philosophy |year=2010 |publisher=[[Yale University Press]] |location=New Haven |isbn=978-0-300-14577-9|language=en|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xCIGu8_laMAC}}\n\n==External links==\n{{wikiquote|Red River (film)}}\n* {{IMDb title|0040724}}\n* {{AllMovie title|40717}}\n* {{TCMDb title|16633}}\n* {{AFI film|25692}}\n* {{cite web |url=https://archive.org/download/Lux14/Lux_49-03-07_Red_River.mp3 |title=Red River}} on [[Lux Radio Theatre]]: March 7, 1949. 14 Mb download.\n\n{{Howard Hawks}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Red River (Film)}}\n[[Category:1948 Western (genre) films]]\n[[Category:1948 films]]\n[[Category:1940s English-language films]]\n[[Category:American Western (genre) films]]\n[[Category:American black-and-white films]]\n[[Category:American epic films]]\n[[Category:Films about farmers]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Howard Hawks]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Dimitri Tiomkin]]\n[[Category:Films set in Texas]]\n[[Category:Films set in the 1850s]]\n[[Category:Films set in the 1860s]]\n[[Category:Films shot in California]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Louisiana]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Mexico]]\n[[Category:United States National Film Registry films]]\n[[Category:Western (genre) epic films]]\n[[Category:1940s American films]]"}]}}}}
