It is the third installment in the ''Power Rangers'' film series, and is a [[Reboot (fiction)|reboot]] that loosely adapts \"[[Day of the Dumpster]]\", the [[pilot episode]] of ''[[Mighty Morphin Power Rangers]]''. The film features the main characters of the television series with a new cast, starring [[Dacre Montgomery]], [[Naomi Scott]], [[RJ Cyler]], [[Becky G]], [[Ludi Lin]], [[Bill Hader]], [[Bryan Cranston]], and [[Elizabeth Banks]]. The film follows a group of teenagers who gain newfound powers, and must use them to protect Earth from an ancient reawakened threat. Franchise creator [[Haim Saban]] returned to produce the film under his [[Saban Capital Group|investment firm]].\n\n''Power Rangers'' premiered at the [[Fox Theater, Westwood Village|Regency Village Theater]] in Los Angeles on March 22, 2017, and was released in the United States on March 24, 2017, by [[Lionsgate Films|Lionsgate]].<ref name=\"vty\" /> It was met with mixed reviews upon release, with praise for the visual effects, cinematography, musical score and performances (particularly Montgomery and Cyler), but criticism for its uneven tone, product placement, divergences from its source material, lack of action and especially the lack of ambition. It was also a [[box-office bomb]], grossing $142 million worldwide against a budget of $105 million. The film was intended to launch a film series with multiple sequels, but all plans were cancelled due to its commercial failure, leading Saban to sell the franchise rights to [[Hasbro]]. Another reboot is in development.\n\n==Plot==\n<!--per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summary should be between 400 and 700 words.-->\nIn the [[Cenozoic]] era, warriors known as the Power Rangers are tasked with protecting life on Earth and the [[Zeo Crystal]]. The Green Ranger, [[Rita Repulsa]], betrays them and plans to dominate the universe. The Red Ranger, [[Zordon]], survives Rita's attack and hides five of the Power Coins. He orders [[Alpha 5 (Power Rangers)|Alpha 5]], his [[robot|robotic assistant]], to perform [[Chicxulub impactor|a meteor strike]] that kills him, the dinosaurs, and sends Rita to the bottom of the sea, foiling her scheme.\n\nSixty-five million years later in the town of [[Angel Grove]], high school football star [[Jason Lee Scott|Jason Scott]] is dismissed from the team and placed under [[house arrest]] after an unsuccessful prank led to a car crash while escaping the police. In detention, he encounters [[autism spectrum|autistic]] class nerd [[Billy Cranston]], who is in detention for \u201cblowing up\u201d his lunchbox. He also meets former cheerleader [[Kimberly Hart]], who is in detention due to punching her former boyfriend\u2019s tooth out, and then placing it back, as well as taking part in cyberbullying. Billy offers to deactivate Jason's [[ankle monitor]] if he will drive him to an old gold mine that evening. Once there, Jason leaves to explore and runs into Kimberly swimming in a lake. Billy detonates explosives to break some rock, attracting the attention of Jason, Kimberly, and nearby students, loner [[Trini Kwan]] and funny [[Zack Taylor]]. The five discover the Power Coins and each takes one. While escaping mine security, their car is hit by a train. The five find themselves at home the next morning and discover that the coins have granted them superhuman abilities. Elsewhere, Rita's body is found. Waking, she goes on a rampage, hunting pieces of gold to raise her minion [[Goldar]] to find the Zeo Crystal.\n\nThe five teenagers return to the mine and discover an ancient spaceship where they meet Alpha 5 and Zordon's consciousness. They inform the teenagers about the Rangers' history and Rita, warning that they have two weeks until Rita has her full power, finds the Zeo Crystal, and uses it to destroy life on Earth. Zordon pleads with Jason to convince the team to help.\n\nThe five spend the next week training against simulated Putties and trying to morph. To inspire the Rangers, Alpha reveals the [[Zord]]s. Zack takes his Zord out for a joyride and almost kills the other Rangers when he crashes it. This angers Jason, and they fight. While trying to separate the two, Billy spontaneously morphs. However, when he becomes conscious of it, the armor disappears. Angered at their lack of progress, Zordon dismisses the group. Jason returns to the ship to confront Zordon and discovers that once the Rangers morph, it will open the Morphing Grid and allow Zordon to restore himself to a physical body. Feeling betrayed, Jason accuses Zordon of bringing the team together for the sole purpose of escaping the Grid. That night, the team camped at the mine and bonded with each other.\n\nLater that night, Rita attacks Trini and orders her to bring the Rangers to the docks. Trini informs them about Rita and they arrive to fight but are quickly defeated. Rita forces Billy to reveal the location of the Zeo Crystal, which he figured out is under a [[Krispy Kreme]], kills him, and releases the others. The Rangers take Billy's body to the ship and ask Zordon to resurrect him. The Rangers agree they would give their lives for each other and resolve to defeat Rita. In doing so, they unlock the Morphing Grid. Zordon revives Billy, sacrificing being able to restore his physical self. With the team restored and confident, the Rangers morph into their armor.\n\nRita creates Goldar, raises an army of Putties, and attacks Angel Grove to find the Zeo Crystal. The Rangers battle the Putties and head to Angel Grove in their Zords. After the Rangers destroy the Putties, Goldar pushes the Rangers and their Zords into a fiery pit. In the pit, the Zords combine and form the Megazord. Rita merges with Goldar. The Rangers battle and destroy Goldar. After refusing Jason's offer to surrender, a defiant Rita tells the Rangers that more will come for the Zeo  Crystal and leaps at the Megazord only to be slapped into space. The Rangers are praised as local heroes, and with Rita defeated, they return to their normal lives while keeping their new powers.\n\nBack at school, the teacher announces that [[Tommy Oliver]] will be joining them, but the desk is empty save for a green jacket. {{efn|In the source material, Tommy Oliver was a male, but the cast of the film and the actor who played Oliver in the source material expressed interest in a female version of the character in a sequel.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Shepherd |first1=Jack J |title=Power Rangers cast want female green ranger in future |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/news/power-rangers-tommy-oliver-green-female-a7651076.html |work=The Independent |access-date=June 25, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170327011222/http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/news/power-rangers-tommy-oliver-green-female-a7651076.html |archive-date=March 27, 2017 |url-status=live |date=March 26, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Porreca |first1=Brian |title='Power Rangers': Original Green Ranger on Whether Tommy Should Be Female in the Sequel |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/power-rangers-jason-david-fank-green-ranger-female-interview-989104 |work=The Hollywood Reporter |access-date=June 25, 2017 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20170329013420/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/power-rangers-jason-david-fank-green-ranger-female-interview-989104 |archive-date=March 29, 2017 |url-status=live |date=March 28, 2017}}</ref>}}\n\n==Cast==\n===Power Rangers===\n<!-- NOTE: Names are how they appear in the film's end credits as per [[WP:FILMCAST]]&nbsp;\u2013 do ''not'' change to the names from the TV series -->\n* [[Dacre Montgomery]] as [[Jason Lee Scott|Jason Scott]], the Red Ranger and the leader of the Power Rangers.
