Trying to escape, Sheeta falls from the airship but, thanks to the amulet, she floats to earth, unconscious. An orphan boy named Pazu catches her and takes her to his home in a mining town. Pazu shows her a picture of a legendary floating city, [[Laputa]], taken by his late father. When Dola's pirates and Muska's men appear and pursue them, Pazu and Sheeta, aided by the amulet, fall into an abandoned mine, where she tells how she was kidnapped from her mountain home because of her necklace. Old miner Uncle Pom shows them the glowing deposits of Aetherium<ref>Sheeta's amulet is made of {{Nihongo|''hik\u014dseki''|\u98db\u884c\u77f3|\"levitation stone\"}} crystal (\"Volucite\" or \"Aetherium\" in English-language releases)</ref> around them.\n\nLeaving the mine, Sheeta tells Pazu her full name - Lucita Toel Ul Laputa - revealing her as a descendant of the Laputan royal family. Muska captures them and takes them to his fortress where the children are imprisoned in different rooms. Muska shows Sheeta a broken Laputan [[robot]]; knowing her name, he intends to make her reveal Laputa's location. Muska threatens Pazu; for his own safety, Sheeta orders him to leave. A despondent Pazu returns home, where Dola and her sons await. To rescue Sheeta, Pazu joins them.\n\nSheeta recites a [[apotropaic|spell]] her grandmother taught her, unintentionally activating the amulet and the robot, which wreaks havoc until it is destroyed by the military's huge airship, ''Goliath''. Pazu rescues Sheeta, but Muska obtains the amulet. Pazu, Sheeta and the pirates return to their airship and pursue the ''Goliath'', which is navigating by Sheeta's amulet. Along the way, Dola tells Pazu and Sheeta how to turn the lookout into a kite, giving them a higher vantage point. Pazu spots a swirl of clouds in an approaching hurricane. Recognizing the clouds from his father's stories, he tells Dola they have found Laputa and insists that they head toward the eye of the storm. However, the ''Goliath'' appears, damages the pirate ship and severs the lookout kite from it, sending Pazu and Sheeta into the clouds.\n\nSheeta and Pazu safely reach Laputa, where they find plants and animals thriving in the ruins of the castle, which surround a huge tree. However, the army plunders the city, with the pirates as their captives. Muska captures Sheeta while Pazu frees the pirates. Muska takes Sheeta into the center of Laputa, a vast repository of scientific knowledge where an immense crystal powers the city. Muska reveals his real name, \u201cRomuska Palo Ul Laputa\", another member of the royal line that left Laputa centuries ago. Using Sheeta's crystal to access Laputan technology, he unleashes Laputa's secret [[weapon of mass destruction]] and a dormant robot army, destroys the ''Goliath'' and its crew, and declares his plans to conquer the world. Horrified, Sheeta steals back the amulet and flees. She gives the amulet to Pazu through a gap in the wall but is cornered by a pursuing Muska in Laputa's dilapidated [[throne room]].\n\nSheeta rebukes Muska, also revealing the people of Laputa left because they realized that man was meant to live on earth. Undaunted, Muska threatens to kill her unless she gives him the amulet. Pazu arrives and asks to speak with her, and Muska grants them one minute.<ref>(three in the original Japanese version)</ref> Sheeta and Pazu recite a Spell of Destruction connected to the crystal, causing the center of Laputa to collapse and blinding Muska, who falls to his death offscreen, while the children are protected by the tree roots. The remainder of Laputa's ruins ascend until they disappear from view, supported by its crystal. Pazu and Sheeta take the kite to rendezvous with the pirates before both groups part ways.\n\nAmidst the end credits, Laputa is shown floating in [[stationary orbit]] above Earth.\n\n==Cast==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The sound mix received a vast overhaul as well. \n* Pazu and Sheeta, voiced by [[James Van Der Beek]] and [[Anna Paquin]], respectively, are made to sound several years older, placing them in their mid-teens rather than their pre-teens.\n* Several modifications were made to the Dola gang's dialogue regarding Sheeta, including a declaration of love by one of the pirates. In the original Japanese version, the dialogue presented Sheeta as a potential mother figure to the pirates, rather than a potential romantic interest.\n* References to [[Robert Louis Stevenson]]'s ''[[Treasure Island]]'' and [[Jonathan Swift]]'s ''[[Gulliver's Travels]]'' were removed, the latter of which had also been removed from the original dub.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Tei |first=Andrew |url=http://www.mania.com/laputa-castle-sky_article_75073.html |title=Laputa: Castle in the Sky |work=Mania |date=October 14, 2003 |location=Santa Monica, California |publisher=Demand Media |access-date=July 14, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140103145935/http://www.mania.com/laputa-castle-sky_article_75073.html |archive-date=January 3, 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nAlthough all these alterations were approved by Studio Ghibli and Miyazaki, some critics have called them into question.

The updated score and sound mix are replaced by the originals in the Japanese-language audio, retaining the updates in the dub. Some of the added dialogue is removed in the dub, restoring silence where it is in the original Japanese version. However, the English subtitles are not updated to reflect the trimmed dialogue, which sometimes results in text being displayed when no characters are speaking. These changes are also seen in the 2012 US Blu-ray release. For the Japanese, Australian, and British Blu-rays, the updated score is used, and the subtitles are properly timed, literal translations from the original Japanese, rather than the improperly timed [[dubtitles]].\n\nThe 2017 Blu-ray rerelease by GKIDS, besides offering the original Japanese, features the 2010 edit of the English dub but presents the option of playing it with either the original or the new score. For subtitles, the correctly translated from Japanese to English subtitles are added. The [[HBO Max]] release of the English dub only uses the original score. In the film's release on [[Netflix]], the Japanese audio features the original audio mix and score, while the English audio features the updated audio mix and score. Subtitles are only available for the original Japanese audio.\n\n==Music==\n\n{{Infobox album\n| name       = Castle in the Sky\n| type       = soundtrack\n| artist     = [[Joe Hisaishi]]\n| cover      =\n| alt        =\n| released   = August 25, 1986\n| recorded   =\n| venue      =\n| studio     =\n| genre      = {{plainlist|\n* [[Anime music]]\n* [[Film score]]\n}}\n| length     = 39:17\n| label      = [[Tokuma]]\n| producer   = [[Joe Hisaishi]]\n| prev_title = [[Arion (manga)|Arion]]\n| prev_year  = 1985\n| next_title = [[Music of the Maison Ikkoku series|Maison Ikkoku]]\n| next_year  = 1986\n}}\n\nAs with all other films by [[Hayao Miyazaki]], [[Joe Hisaishi]] composed the music for ''Castle in the Sky''.

Certain English- and Spanish-language releases have opted to omit the name \"Laputa\" due to it resembling \"la puta\" ({{lit}} \"the whore\") in Spanish.\n\nIn 2003, the film's title was shortened to ''Castle in the Sky'' in several countries, including the United States, United Kingdom, Mexico, and Spain. In Spain the castle was named ''Lapuntu'' in the first dub in 2003, although in the second one made in 2010 retains the original name ''Laputa.'' In the Catalan dub in 2012, the meaning of ''Laputa'' was said with the tonic syllable in \"La\".\n\nThe film's full title was later restored in Britain, in February 2006, when Optimum Asia \u2013 a division of London-based Optimum Releasing ([[StudioCanal UK]] since 2011) \u2013 acquired the UK distribution rights to the Studio Ghibli collection from Buena Vista Home Entertainment.\n\nAdditionally, during the late 1980s and early 1990s, the pre-Disney dub was screened in the UK as an art-house film, under the alternative title ''Laputa: The Flying Island''. It also aired at least twice on British television, but with some scenes cut.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">{{cite web |title=Tenkuu no Shiro Laputa FAQ |publisher=The Hayao Miyazaki Web |url=http://www.nausicaa.net/miyazaki/laputa/faq.html |access-date=December 30, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081216061438/http://www.nausicaa.net/miyazaki/laputa/faq.html |archive-date=December 16, 2008 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* ''[[Victory Through Air Power (film)|Victory Through Air Power]]'' (1943)\n* ''[[The Fabulous World of Jules Verne]]'' (1958)\n* ''[[Atlantis: The Lost Empire]]'' (2001)\n* ''[[April and the Extraordinary World]]'' (2015)\n\n==Notes==\n{{Notelist}}\n\n==References==\n\n{{Reflist|refs=\n<!--\n<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.allmovie.com/movie/castle-in-the-sky-v163047|title=Castle in the Sky (1986) - Hayao Miyazaki - Synopsis, Characteristics, Moods, Themes and Related - AllMovie|author=Andrea LeVasseur|work=AllMovie}}</ref> \n<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.film4.com/reviews/1986/castle-in-the-sky|title=Castle In The Sky|work=film4.com}}</ref>\n-->\n}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Official website|http://movies.disney.com/castle-in-the-sky}}\n* {{anime News Network|movie|481}}\n* {{AllMovie title|163047|Castle in the Sky}}\n* {{Rotten Tomatoes|castle_in_the_sky_1989}}\n* {{IMDb title|0092067|Laputa: Castle in the Sky}}\n* [http://www.nausicaa.net/miyazaki/laputa ''Laputa: Castle in the Sky''] at [[Nausicaa.net]]\n* {{bcdb title|20680|Tenk\u00fb No Shiro Rapyuta}}\n* [http://www.jmdb.ne.jp/1986/dj002100.htm \u5929\u7a7a\u306e\u57ce\u30e9\u30d4\u30e5\u30bf (''Tenkuu no Shiro Laputa'')] at the [[Japanese Movie Database]] (Japanese)\n\n{{Hayao Miyazaki}}\n{{Studio Ghibli}}\n{{Anime Grand Prix}}\n{{\u014cfuji Nobur\u014d Award}}\n{{Portalbar|Anime and manga|Film}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:1980s children's animated films]]\n[[Category:1980s children's fantasy films]]\n[[Category:1986 fantasy films]]\n[[Category:1986 anime films]]\n[[Category:1986 films]]\n[[Category:Abandoned buildings and structures in fiction]]\n[[Category:Adventure anime and manga]]\n[[Category:Airships in fiction]]\n[[Category:Animated films about aviation]]\n[[Category:Animated films about friendship]]\n[[Category:Animated films about orphans]]\n[[Category:Anime with original screenplays]]\n[[Category:Dieselpunk films]]\n[[Category:Drama anime and manga]]\n[[Category:Fantasy adventure films]]\n[[Category:Fictional fortifications]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Hayao Miyazaki]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Joe Hisaishi]]\n[[Category:Films set in castles]]\n[[Category:1980s Japanese-language films]]\n[[Category:Mecha anime and manga]]\n[[Category:Pirate films]]\n[[Category:Pirates in anime and manga]]\n[[Category:Japanese robot films]]\n[[Category:Romance anime and manga]]\n[[Category:Steampunk anime and manga]]\n[[Category:Steampunk films]]\n[[Category:Studio Ghibli animated films]]"}]}}}}
