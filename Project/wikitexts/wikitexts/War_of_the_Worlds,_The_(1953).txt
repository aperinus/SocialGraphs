G. Wells' The War of the Worlds''''') is a 1953 American [[science fiction film]] from [[Paramount Pictures]], produced by [[George Pal]], directed by [[Byron Haskin]], and starring [[Gene Barry]] and [[Ann Robinson]].\n\nThe film is an adaptation of the 1898 novel ''[[The War of the Worlds]]'' by [[H. G. Wells]], the first of five [[feature film]] adaptations. As a retelling, the setting was changed from [[Victorian era]]-[[England]] to 1953 southern [[California]]. Earth is suddenly and unexpectedly invaded by [[Martian (War of the Worlds)|Martians]], and American scientist [[Doctor Clayton Forrester (War of the Worlds)|Clayton Forrester]] searches for any weakness to stop them.\n\n''The War of the Worlds'' won an [[Academy Award for Best Visual Effects]] and went on to influence other science fiction films. In 2011, it was selected for the [[National Film Registry]] in the United States [[Library of Congress]], being deemed \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".\n\n==Plot==\nIn [[Southern California]], [[Doctor Clayton Forrester (The War of the Worlds)|Dr. Clayton Forrester]], a well-known atomic scientist, is fishing with colleagues when a large object crashes near the small town of Linda Rosa, California, southeast of [[Corona, California|Corona]]. At the impact site, he meets [[University of Southern California|USC]] [[library science]] instructor Sylvia Van Buren and her uncle, Pastor Matthew Collins. Later that night, a round hatch on the object unscrews and falls away. As the three men standing guard at the site attempt to make contact while waving a white flag, a Martian heat-ray obliterates them. The [[United States Marine Corps]] later surrounds the crash site, as reports pour in of identical cylinders landing all over the world and destroying cities. Three Martian [[Fighting machine (The War of the Worlds)|war machines]] emerge from the cylinder. Pastor Collins attempts to make contact with the aliens, but he is disintegrated. The Marines open fire, but are unable to penetrate the Martians' [[Force shield|force field]]. The aliens counterattack with their heat-ray and skeleton-beam weapons, sending the Marines into full retreat. Air force jets next attack the Martian war machines, but are anniliated.\n\nAttempting to escape in a small, single engine military [[spotter plane]], Forrester and Sylvia crash land and hide in an abandoned farmhouse. They begin to develop closer feelings for each other just before the house is buried by yet another crashing cylinder. A long cable with an [[electronic eye]] explores the farmhouse from a nearby war machine eventually spots them, but Forrester cuts off the lens housing using an axe. Later, when a Martian enters and approaches Sylvia, Forrester injures it with the axe and collects its blood on a cloth. They escape just before the farmhouse is obliterated by their heat-ray. Forrester takes the electronic eye and blood sample to his team at Pacific Tech in the hope of finding a way to defeat the invaders. The scientists discover how the Martian eye works and also note that alien blood is extremely [[anemic]].\n\nMany of the major world capitals fall silent, and global Martian victory is estimated to be only six days away. The United States government makes the decision to drop an [[atomic bomb]] on the original group of Martian war machines advancing towards [[Los Angeles]] from the east, near the [[Puente Hills]]. The atomic blast, however, is totally ineffective. As the aliens advance on Los Angeles, the city is evacuated. The Pacific Tech trucks are stopped by a mob bent on escape, and all the scientific equipment is destroyed. Forrester, Sylvia, and the other scientists become separated in the chaos.\n\nForrester searches for Sylvia in the deserted city. Based on a story she had told him earlier, he guesses that she would take refuge in a church. After searching through several, he finds Sylvia among many praying and injured survivors. Just as the Martians attack near the church, their machines suddenly lose power one after the other and crash. Forrester sees one of the aliens expire while trying to leave its fallen war machine. The narrator observes that though the Martians were impervious to humanity's weapons, they had \"no resistance to the bacteria in our atmosphere to which we have long since become immune. After all that men could do had failed, they were destroyed and humanity was saved by the littlest things, which God, in His wisdom, had put upon this Earth\".\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Gene Barry]] as [[Doctor Clayton Forrester (The War of the Worlds)|Dr. Clayton Forrester]]\n* [[Ann Robinson]] as Sylvia van Buren\n* [[Les Tremayne]] as Major General Mann\n* [[Robert O.

The image then [[smash cut]]s to vivid [[Technicolor]] and the dramatic opening title card and credits.\n\nThe story begins with a series of color [[matte paintings]] by astronomical artist [[Chesley Bonestell]] that depict the planets of our [[Solar System]], except [[Venus]], about which little was known at the time. A narrator (Sir [[Cedric Hardwicke]]) tours the hostile environment of each world, eventually explaining to the audience why the [[Martian]]s find our lush green and blue [[Earth]] the only world worthy of their scrutiny and coming invasion.<ref name=\"Warren\"/><ref name=\"Rubin\">Rubin 1977, pp. 4\u201316, 34\u201347.</ref>\n\nThis is the first of two adaptations of Wells's classic science fiction that were filmed by George Pal.

The plan was dropped before production began.

St. Brendan's Catholic Church, at 310 South Van Ness Avenue in Los Angeles, was the setting for the climactic scene in which a large group of desperate people gather to pray. The rolling hills and main thoroughfares of [[El Sereno, Los Angeles]], were also used in the film.<ref name=\"Warren\"/>\n\nOn the [[Audio commentary|commentary track]] of the 2005 Special Collector's DVD Edition of ''War of the Worlds'', Robinson and Barry say that the cartoon character [[Woody Woodpecker]] is in a treetop, center screen, when the first large Martian meteorite-ship crashes through the sky, near the beginning of the film. George Pal and Woody's creator, [[Walter Lantz]], were close friends. Pal tried always to include Woody out of friendship and for good luck in his productions. Joe Adamson wrote years later: \"Walter had been close friends with Pal ever since Pal had left Europe in advance of the war and arrived in Hollywood\".<ref name=\"Adamson 1985\">Adamson, Joe.

Retrieved: 25 August 2012.</ref>\n\n===Differences from the Wells novel===\nCaroline Blake has written that the film is very different from the original novel in its attitude toward religion, as reflected especially in the depiction of [[clergymen]]. \"The staunchly [[secularist]] Wells depicted a cowardly and thoroughly uninspiring [[Curate]], whom the narrator regards with disgust, with which the reader is invited to concur. In the film, there is instead the sympathetic and heroic Pastor Collins who dies a martyr's death. And then the film's final scene in the church, strongly emphasizing the Divine nature of Humanity's deliverance, has no parallel in the original book.\"<ref>Caroline G. Blake, ''Religion in Speculative Fiction'', Ch.2, 5</ref>\n\nPal's adaptation has many other differences from H. G. Wells's novel. The closest resemblance is probably that of the antagonists. The film's aliens are indeed Martians and invade Earth for the same reasons as those stated in the novel. The state of Mars suggests that it is becoming unable to support life, leading to the Martians' decision to try to make Earth their new home. They land in the same way, by crashing to Earth. The novel's spacecraft, however, are large, cylindrical projectiles fired from the Martian surface from a cannon, instead of the film's meteorite-spaceships; but the Martians emerge from their craft in the same way, by unscrewing a large, round hatch. They appear to have no use for humans in the film. In the novel, however, the invaders are observed \"feeding\" on humans by fatally transfusing their captives' blood supply directly into Martian bodies through [[pipettes]]. There is later speculation about the Martians' eventually using trained human slaves to hunt down all remaining survivors after they conquer Earth. In the film, the Martians do not bring their fast-growing [[red weed]] with them, but they are defeated by Earth [[microorganisms]], as in the novel. However, they die from the effects of the microorganisms within three days of the landing of the first meteorite-ship; in the novel, the Martians die within about three weeks of their invasion of England.<ref name=\"Rubin\"/>\n\nThe film's Martians bear no physical resemblance to those of the novel, who are described as bear-sized, roundish creatures with grayish-brown bodies, \"merely heads\", with quivering beak-like, V-shaped mouths dripping [[saliva]]. They have sixteen whip-like tentacles in two groupings of eight arranged on each side of their mouths and two large \"luminous, disk-like eyes\". Because of budget constraints, their film counterparts are short, reddish-brown creatures with two long, thin arms with three long, thin fingers with suction-cup tips. The Martian head is a broad \"face\" at the top-front of its broad-shouldered upper torso, the only apparent feature of which is a single, large eye with three distinctly colored lenses of red, blue, and green. The Martians' lower extremities are never shown. Some speculative designs suggest three thin legs resembling their fingers, and others show them as [[bipeds]] with short, stubby legs with three-toed feet.<ref name=\"Rubin\"/>\n\nThe film's Martian war machines are more like those of the book than they first seem. The novel's war machines are 10-story-tall fast-moving tripods made of glittering metal, each with a \"brazen hood\" atop the body, moving \"to and fro\" as the machine moves. A heat-ray projector on an articulated arm is connected to the front of each machine's main body. However, the film's war machines are shaped like manta rays, with a bulbous, elongated green window at the front, through which the Martians observe their surroundings. On top of the machine is the cobra-like head heat-ray attached to a long, narrow, goose-neck extension, which can fire in any direction. They can be mistaken for flying machines, but Forrester states that they are lifted by invisible legs. One scene when the first war machine emerges has faint traces of three \"energy legs\" beneath that leave three sparking traces where they touch the burning ground, so they are tripods, though they are never so called. Whereas the novel's machines have no protection against the British army and navy cannon fire, the film's war machines have a force field surrounding them, described by Forrester as a \"protective blister\".<ref name=\"Rubin\"/>\n\nThe Martian weaponry is also partially unchanged. The heat-ray has the very same effect as that of the novel. However, the novel's heat-ray mechanism is briefly described as just a rounded hump when its silhouette rises above the landing crater's rim; it fires an invisible energy beam in a wide arc while still in the pit made by the first Martian cylinder after it crash-lands. The film's first heat-ray scene has a projector shaped like a cobra head with a single, red pulsing light, which likely acts as a targeting telescope for the Martians inside their war machine shaped like a manta ray. The novel describes another weapon, the \"black smoke\" used to kill all life; the war machines fire canisters containing a black smoke-powder through a [[bazooka]]-like tube accessory. When dispersed, this black powder is lethal to all life forms who breathe it. This weapon is replaced in the film by a Martian \"skeleton beam\" of green pulsing energy bursts fired from the wingtips of the manta-ray machines; these bursts break apart the [[sub-atomic]] bonds that hold matter together. These beams are used off-screen to obliterate several French cities.<ref name=\"Rubin\"/>\n\nThe plot of the film is very different from the novel, which tells the story of a 19th-century writer (with additional narration in later chapters by his medical-student younger brother), who journeys through [[Victorian London]] and its southwestern suburbs while the Martians attack, eventually being reunited with his wife; the film's protagonist is a California scientist who falls in love with a former college student after the Martian invasion begins. However, certain points of the film's plot are similar to the novel, from the crash-landing of the Martian meteorite-ships to their eventual defeat by Earth's microorganisms. Forrester also experiences similar events like the book's narrator, with an ordeal in a destroyed house, observing an actual Martian up close, and eventually reuniting with his love interest at the end of the story. The film has more of a Cold War theme with the atomic bomb against the invading enemy and the mass destruction that such a global war would inflict on humanity.<ref name=\"Rubin\"/>\n\n===Special effects===\nAn effort was made to avoid the stereotypical flying saucer look of [[unidentified flying object|UFOs]]. The Martian war machines were designed by [[Albert Nozaki]] with a sinister [[manta ray]] shape floating above the ground. Three Martian war machine props were made of copper. The same blueprints were used a decade later (without neck and cobra head) to construct the alien spacecraft in the film ''[[Robinson Crusoe on Mars]]'', also directed by Byron Haskin. That prop was reportedly melted for a scrap copper recycling drive.<ref name=\"Rubin\"/>\n\nEach Martian machine is topped with an articulated metal neck and arm, culminating in the [[cobra]] head heat ray projector, housing a single electronic eye that operates both as a [[periscope]] and as a weapon. The electronic eye houses a heat ray, which pulses and fires red sparking beams, all accompanied by thrumming and a high-pitched clattering shriek when the ray was used. The distinctive [[sound effect]] of the weapon was created by an orchestra performing a written score, mainly with violins and cellos. For many years, it was utilized as a standard ray-gun sound on children's television shows and the science-fiction anthology series ''[[The Outer Limits (1963 TV series)|The Outer Limits]]'', particularly in the episode \"[[The Children of Spider County]]\".<ref name=\"Warren\"/>\n\nThe machines also fire a pulsing green ray (referred to in dialog as \"a skeleton beam\") from their wingtips, generating a distinctive sound and disintegrating their targets. This second weapon is a replacement for the [[chemical warfare|chemical weapon]] [[Black smoke (The War of the Worlds)|black smoke]] described in Wells's novel. Its sound effect (created by striking a high tension cable with a hammer) was reused in ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series]]'', accompanying the launch of [[photon torpedo]]es. The sound when the Martian ships begin to move was also reused by ''Star Trek'' as the sound of an overloading hand phaser. Another prominent sound effect is a chattering, synthesized echo, perhaps representing some kind of Martian [[sonar]] sounds like hissing electronic rattlesnakes.<ref name=\"Warren\"/>\n\nWhen the large Marine force opens fire on the Martians with everything in its heavy arsenal, each Martian machine is protected by an impenetrable [[Force shield|force field]] that resembles, when briefly visible between explosions, the clear jar placed over a mantle clock, or a [[bell jar]] with a [[cylindrical]] shape and a [[hemispherical]] top. This effect was accomplished with simple matte paintings on clear glass, which were then photographed and combined with other effects, and optically printed together during post-production.<ref name=\"Rubin\"/>\n\nThe disintegration effect took 144 separate matte paintings to create. The sound effects of the war machines' heat rays firing were created by mixing the sound of three [[electric guitar]]s being recorded backwards. The Martian's scream in the farmhouse ruins was created by mixing the sound of a microphone scraping along dry ice being combined with a woman's recorded scream and then reversed.<ref name=\"Warren\"/>\n\nThere were many problems trying to create the walking [[Tripod (The War of the Worlds)|tripods]] of Wells's novel. It was eventually decided to make the Martian machines appear to float in the air on three invisible legs. To visualize them, subtle special effects of downward lights were to be added directly under the moving war machines; however, in the final film, these only appear when one of the first machines can be seen rising from the Martian's landing site. It proved too difficult and dangerous to mark out the invisible legs while smoke and other effects must remain visible beneath the machines, and the effect also created a major fire hazard. In all of the subsequent scenes, however, the three invisible leg beams create small, sparking fires where they touch the ground.<ref name=\"Warren\"/>\n\n===Quality of special effects===\nFor 50 years, from the late 1960s when ''The War of the Worlds'' 3-strip Technicolor prints were replaced by the easier-to-use and less expensive Eastman Color stock, the quality of the film's special effects suffered dramatically. This degraded the lighting, timing, and image resolution, causing the original invisible wires suspending the Martian war machines to become increasingly visible with each succeeding film and video format. This led many, including respected critics, to mistakenly believe the effects were originally of low quality.<ref>Miller, Thomas Kent. ''Mars in the Movies: A History''.
