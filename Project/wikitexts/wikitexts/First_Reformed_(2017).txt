''First Reformed'' was chosen by both the [[National Board of Review Awards 2018#Top 10 Films|National Board of Review]] and [[American Film Institute Awards 2018#Top 10 Films|American Film Institute]] as one of the top 10 films of 2018. Schrader's screenplay won at the [[Critics' Choice Movie Awards|Critics' Choice Awards]], and was nominated at both the [[Independent Spirit Awards]] and the [[Academy Awards]]. At the Independent Spirit Awards, ''First Reformed'' also received nominations for [[Independent Spirit Award for Best Film|Best Film]], [[Independent Spirit Award for Best Director|Best Director]]; it won [[Independent Spirit Award for Best Male Lead|Best Male Lead]] for Hawke.\n\n==Plot==\nErnst Toller is the pastor of the First Reformed Church in Snowbridge, New York, who is struggling with a crisis of faith. The film opens with him writing down his thoughts in a journal, which he plans to keep for a year, and then destroy.\n\nThe church is a 250-year-old [[Reformed Church in America|Dutch Reformed Church]] and was once a stop on the [[Underground Railroad]]. It faces dwindling attendance, so the church has moved away from its historical focus on [[Calvinist]] theology and now serves mostly as a tourist attraction. Toller, a former [[military chaplain]], is struggling with [[alcoholism]] and the death of his son Joseph, who was killed in the [[Iraq War]]. Toller seeks a deeper spiritual understanding through reading Roman Catholic writers ([[G.&nbsp;K. Chesterton]] and [[Thomas Merton]]) and mystical books (''[[The Cloud of Unknowing]]''). This leads him to seek support from Abundant Life, the evangelical [[megachurch]] in [[Albany, New York|Albany]] that owns First Reformed.\n\nHe is approached by Mary, who is seeking counseling for Michael, her [[Radical environmentalism|radical-environmentalist]] husband. Michael further challenges Toller's beliefs: he wants Mary to get an abortion, because he does not want to bring a child into a world that will be rendered almost uninhabitable by [[climate change]].\n\nMary finds a [[Explosive belt|suicide vest]] belonging to her husband in their garage. Toller takes it, promising to counsel Michael about it. They discuss going to the police, but Toller feels it would worsen Michael's state. Just before their next appointment, Michael sends him a text message asking to meet in a local park. Toller arrives to find Michael dead of a self-inflicted shotgun wound. In accordance with Michael's [[will and testament]], a service is held at a local toxic-waste dump, where his ashes are scattered.\n\nMeanwhile, plans are underway to celebrate the 250th anniversary of First Reformed with a service attended by the mayor, the governor, and Edward Balq, one of Abundant Life's key financial backers and the owner of a polluting factory. At a meeting in a diner, Balq takes issue with Toller honoring Michael's will, deeming it a political act, and they argue over climate change: Balq dismisses it as \"complicated\", but Toller sees it as a straightforward matter of Christian [[Stewardship (theology)|stewardship]].\n\nExperiencing physical pain, Toller reluctantly sees a doctor, who suspects stomach cancer and schedules some tests. Toller has Michael's laptop computer, which he took after Michael's suicide to prevent the police from discovering his radicalism and making trouble for Mary. He uses it to research Michael's concerns, including the materials on Balq's factory which inspired him to make the explosive vest. One night, Mary visits Toller in the [[parsonage]] of the church, and she asks him to play Michael's role in a nonsexual rite of physical intimacy the couple used to perform.\n\nToller begs Mary not to attend the anniversary service. Preparing for his role in the ceremony, he puts on the explosive vest, and arms it. When he sees her entering the church, he removes the vest and instead wraps himself in barbed wire under his [[alb]]. Toller pours a glass full of [[drain cleaner]] and is about to drink it when Mary interrupts him. They embrace, kissing passionately before the film abruptly cuts to black.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Ethan Hawke]] as Pastor Ernst Toller, leader of a tiny historic church who is going through several personal crises\n* [[Amanda Seyfried]] as Mary Mensana, a pregnant widow and parishioner at First Reformed\n* [[Cedric Kyles]] as Pastor Joel Jeffers, megachurch pastor at the evangelical Abundant Life church\n* [[Victoria Hill]] as Esther, a worker at Abundant Life who is in love with Toller\n* [[Philip Ettinger]] as Michael Mensana, a radical environmentalist and [[Anti-natalism|anti-natalist]] whose suicide emboldens Toller\n* [[Michael Gaston]] as Edward Balq, local industrialist and financier of Abundant Life\n* Bill Hoag as John Elder, church organist at First Reformed  (Performed by William E.
