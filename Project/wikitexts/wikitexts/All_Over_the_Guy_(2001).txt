The film is told mostly in [[flashback (literary technique)|flashback]]; with Eli recounting his side to Esther ([[Doris Roberts]]), an [[HIV]] clinic worker as he waits for test results and Tom telling his side to a man he meets at an [[Alcoholics Anonymous]] meeting. Tom is the son of emotionally distant alcoholic [[White Anglo-Saxon Protestant|WASP]] parents who never quite accepted his sexual orientation and as a result is a heavy drinker himself and has a penchant for random [[Casual sex|hookups]] with different men. Eli's parents are both Jewish psychiatrists who raised him to be emotionally open but ended up making him neurotic.\n\nTom and Eli are set up on a [[wiktionary:blind date|blind date]] by their best friends, Jackie ([[Sasha Alexander]]) and Brett ([[Adam Goldberg (actor)|Adam Goldberg]]), who think they would be a perfect match. They're both looking for 'The One', but don't recognize it when they find it. On the date, a boring evening is broken up only by an amusing diatribe by Tom against the movie ''[[In & Out (film)|In & Out]]''. A few days later they run into each other at a [[flea market]] and hit it off, winding up back at Eli's place where Tom spends the night. The next morning Tom says that it was a mistake.\n\nJackie and Brett decide to try again to set them up, and the two men start to develop a relationship. Tom's fear of becoming emotionally close coupled with Eli's own insecurities makes it difficult for them to maintain, but Jackie and Brett get engaged which forces Tom and Eli together. They disguise their unease behind petty arguments over meaningless details of grammar and pronunciation but are finally able to push past the pettiness and make love. Eli tells Tom he loves him and Tom, terrified, lashes out at him the next day and drives him away.\n\nThe flashbacks end here on the day of Brett and Jackie's wedding. Esther tries to teach Eli to be more understanding of Tom's emotional needs. The AA member tries to sexually assault Tom and when he tells Jackie, she upbraids him for throwing Eli away for daring to fall for him. At the reception, Eli and Tom come to realize that they have to overcome their families' dysfunction and their own fears.\n\n==Release==\n''All Over the Guy'' premiered in 2001, with a small band called Kara's Flowers on hand to perform at the after party. That band later changed its name to [[Maroon 5]].<ref name = \"Ryll 2014\">{{cite web |url=http://gay-themed-films.com/watch-all-over-the-guy/ |title=Essential Gay Themed Films To Watch, All Over The Guy |author=Alexander Ryll | publisher=Gay Essential |accessdate=7 February 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Critical reception==\nThe film received mixed reviews from critics.
