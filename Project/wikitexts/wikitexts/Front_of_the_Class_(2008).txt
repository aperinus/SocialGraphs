With the support from his mother and school principal, Brad is a success story, becoming a motivational speaker and an award-winning teacher.\n\n==Plot==\nTwelve-year-old Brad lives in Missouri with his divorc\u00e9e mother, Ellen, and younger brother, Jeff. He constantly gets into trouble with his father Norman and his teachers at school due to his tics. In one class, his teacher calls him to the front to make him apologize to his class for disrupting the class and promise he won't do it again. Determined to find out what is wrong with her son, Ellen seeks medical help. A psychiatrist believes that Brad's tics are the result of his parents' divorce. One lady suggests an exorcism. Ellen takes her search to the library and comes across Tourette syndrome (TS) in a medical book. She shows this to the psychiatrist, who agrees with the diagnosis, and says that there is no cure. Brad and his mother attend a support group for the first and last time. From then on, Brad aspires to never be like the other members of the support group and to become successful.\n\nAt the beginning of middle school, Brad is sent to the principal's office for being disruptive. The principal invites him to the school concert later in the afternoon. At the end of the concert, which Brad's Tourette's tics had disturbed, he calls Brad up to the stage and asks Brad to talk about his TS. As Brad makes his way back to his seat, the school applauds him. For the first time, someone outside his family has given him support and proactively helped him into being accepted by others. From that moment on, Brad has a dream that he will carry on: to become a teacher, just like the principal.\n\nAs an adult, Brad lives with his house mate Ron in Georgia, and is looking for work as an elementary school teacher. He is turned down after 24 interviews because of his TS. He finally gets an interview where the staff is accepting and they give him the job.\n\nOn his first day, Brad explains his TS to the children. He helps a child with ADHD, Thomas, with reading and makes an impression on Heather, a girl with terminal cancer. Another student's father pulls her out of Brad's class as he fears Brad will distract her. When the little girl tries to sneak in Brad's class again, he express his gratefulness, but doesn't oppose the girl's father wishes and reminds her that her father is doing what he thinks it's best for her.\n\nBrad meets Nancy on an online dating site.  After dating her for some time, he invites her over for Thanksgiving back at Ellen's house, where he tells Nancy he loves her, and the feeling is reciprocated. He confides in Ellen his concern that Nancy will get fed up with his tics, but she reassures him that he must not let his TS get in the way.\n\nAn observer at the school assesses Brad's teaching, and the head teacher announces that Brad has been chosen to receive the Teacher of the Year award, which he accepts in front his family, friends and students. The ending titles tell that Brad got his master's degree; he dressed up as Homer, (Atlanta Braves) mascot; he married Nancy in 2006; and a photograph of the real [[Brad Cohen]] teaching his class is shown.\n\n==Cast== \nFrom IMDB:<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1292594/fullcredits?ref_=tt_cl_sm#cast|title=Front of the Class - Cast|website=[[Internet Movie Database]]|access-date=December 8, 2021}}</ref>\n\n* [[James Wolk]] as [[Brad Cohen]]\n** [[Dominic Scott Kay]] as young Brad Cohen\n* [[Treat Williams]] as Norman Cohen; Brad's father\n* [[Patricia Heaton]] as Ellen Cohen; Brad's mother\n* [[Johnny Pacar]] as Jeff Cohen; Brad's younger brother\n** Charles Henry Wyson as young Jeff Cohen\n* [[Sarah Drew]] as Nancy Keene; Brad's girlfriend.
