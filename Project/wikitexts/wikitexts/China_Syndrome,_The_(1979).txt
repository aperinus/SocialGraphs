S. Cook]]. The film stars [[Jane Fonda]], [[Jack Lemmon]], [[Michael Douglas]] (who also produced), [[Scott Brady]], [[James Hampton (actor)|James Hampton]], [[Peter Donat]], [[Richard Herd]], and [[Wilford Brimley]]. It follows a television reporter and her cameraman who discover safety coverups at a [[nuclear power]] plant. \"[[Nuclear meltdown#China syndrome|China syndrome]]\" is a fanciful term that describes a fictional result of a nuclear meltdown, where reactor components melt through their containment structures and into the underlying earth, \"all the way to China\".\n\n''The China Syndrome'' premiered at the [[1979 Cannes Film Festival]], where it competed for the [[Palme d'Or]] while Lemmon received the [[Prix d'interpr\u00e9tation masculine|Best Actor Prize]].<ref name=\"festival-cannes.com\">{{cite web |url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/1898/year/1979.html |title=Festival de Cannes: The China Syndrome |access-date=May 24, 2009 |publisher=Festival-cannes.com |archive-date=January 18, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118064636/http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/1898/year/1979.html |url-status=live }}</ref> It was theatrically released on March 16, 1979, twelve days before the [[Three Mile Island accident|Three Mile Island nuclear accident]] in [[Dauphin County, Pennsylvania]], which gave the film's subject matter an unexpected prescience. It became a critical and commercial success. Reviewers praised the film's screenplay, direction, and performances (most notably of Fonda and Lemmon), while it grossed $51.7 million on a production budget of $5.9 million. The film received four nominations at the [[52nd Academy Awards]]; [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] (for Lemmon), [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]] (for Fonda), [[Academy Award for Writing Original Screenplay|Best Original Screenplay]], and [[Academy Award for Best Production Design|Best Production Design]].<ref name=\"NY Times\">{{cite news |title=The China Syndrome (1979): Awards |url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/9338/The-China-Syndrome/awards |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121018223605/http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/9338/The-China-Syndrome/awards |archive-date=October 18, 2012 |url-status=dead |department=Movies & TV Dept. |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=2012 |access-date=27 June 2018 }}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nWhile visiting the (fictional) Ventana nuclear power plant outside [[Los Angeles]], television news reporter Kimberly Wells, her cameraman Richard Adams and their soundman Hector Salas witness the plant going through a [[turbine trip]] and corresponding [[SCRAM]] (emergency shutdown). Shift Supervisor Jack Godell notices an unusual vibration in his cup of coffee.\n\nIn response to a gauge indicating high water levels, Godell begins removing water from the [[reactor core|core]], but the gauge remains high as operators open more valves to dump water. Another operator notices a second gauge indicating low water levels. Godell taps the first gauge, which immediately unsticks and drops to indicate very low levels. The crew urgently pumps water back in and celebrates in relief at bringing the reactor back under control.{{efn|The sequence of events in the movie is based on events that occurred in 1970 at the [[Dresden Generating Station]] outside Chicago. In that case, the indicator stuck low and the operators responded by adding ever more water.}}\n\nAdams has surreptitiously filmed the incident, despite being asked not to film for security reasons. Wells' superior refuses her report of what happened. Adams steals the footage and shows it to experts who conclude that the plant came perilously close to [[nuclear meltdown|meltdown]] \u2013 the [[China syndrome (nuclear meltdown)|China syndrome]].\n\nDuring an inspection of the plant before it is brought back online, Godell discovers a puddle of radioactive water that has apparently leaked from a pump. He pushes to delay restarting the plant, but the plant superintendent wants nothing standing in the way of the restart.\n\nGodell finds that a series of [[Radiography|radiographs]] supposedly verifying the welds on the leaking pump are identical \u2013 the contractor simply kept resubmitting the same picture. He brings the evidence to the plant manager, who brushes him off as paranoid, stating that new radiographs would cost $20 million. Godell confronts Royce, an employee of Foster-Sullivan who built the plant, as it was he who signed off on the radiographs. Godell threatens to go to the [[Nuclear Regulatory Commission]], but Royce threatens him; later, a pair of men from Foster-Sullivan park outside his house.\n\nWells and Adams confront Godell at his home and he voices his concerns. Wells and Adams ask him to testify at the NRC hearings over Foster-Sullivan's plans to build another nuclear plant. Godell agrees to obtain, through Salas, the false radiographs to take to the hearings.\n\nSalas' car is run off the road and the radiographs are taken from him. Godell is chased by the men waiting outside his home. He takes refuge inside the plant, where he finds that the reactor is being brought up to full power. Grabbing a gun from a security guard, he forces everyone out, including his friend and co-worker Ted Spindler, and demands to be interviewed by Wells on live television. Plant management agrees to the interview in order to buy time as they try to regain control of the plant.\n\nMinutes into the broadcast, plant technicians deliberately cause a SCRAM so they can distract Godell and retake the control room. A [[SWAT]] team forces its way in, the television cable is cut, and Godell is shot. Before dying, he feels the unusual vibration again. The resulting SCRAM is brought under control only by the plant's automatic systems, and the plant suffers significant damage as the pump malfunctions.\n\nPlant officials try to paint Godell as emotionally disturbed, but are contradicted by a distraught Spindler on live television saying Godell was not crazy and would never have taken such drastic steps had there not been something wrong. A tearful Wells concludes her report and the news cuts to a commercial for microwave ovens.\n\n==Cast==\n<!--- Cast order and roles per closing credits scroll --->\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Jane Fonda]] as Kimberly Wells\n* [[Jack Lemmon]] as Jack Godell\n* [[Michael Douglas]] as Richard Adams\n* [[Scott Brady]] as Herman DeYoung\n* [[James Hampton (actor)|James Hampton]] as Bill Gibson\n* [[Peter Donat]] as Don Jacovich\n* [[Wilford Brimley]] as Ted Spindler\n* [[Richard Herd]] as Evan McCormack\n* [[Daniel Valdez]] as Hector Salas\n* Stan Bohrman as Pete Martin\n* [[James Karen]] as Mac Churchill\n}}\n\n==Reception==\n[[Roger Ebert]] reviewed it as:\n\n{{blockquote|...a terrific thriller that incidentally raises the most unsettling questions about how safe nuclear power plants really are. ... The movie is ... well-acted, well-crafted, scary as hell. The events leading up to the \"accident\" in ''The China Syndrome'' are indeed based on actual occurrences at nuclear plants. Even the most unlikely mishap (a stuck needle on a graph causing engineers to misread a crucial water level) really happened at the [[Dresden Generating Station#Incidents|Dresden plant outside Chicago]]. And yet the movie works so well not because of its factual basis, but because of its human content.
