It tells the story of Zac, a young gay man dealing with [[homophobia]] while growing up with four brothers and his father in Quebec during the 1960s and 1970s. The film employs an extensive [[soundtrack]], featuring artists such as [[David Bowie]], [[Pink Floyd]], [[Patsy Cline]], [[Charles Aznavour]], and [[The Rolling Stones]].\n\nA popular piece in the [[Cinema of Quebec]], ''C.R.A.Z.Y.'' was one of the highest-grossing films of the year in the province. The film won numerous honours, among them 11 [[26th Genie Awards|Genie Awards]], including [[Canadian Screen Award for Best Motion Picture|Best Motion Picture]]. At Quebec's [[Prix Jutra]] film awards, it won 13 awards in the competitive categories from 14 nominations, becoming the all-time record holder for most award wins at that ceremony; it also won both of the box-office based awards, the ''Billet d'or'' and the ''Film s'\u00e9tant le plus illustr\u00e9 \u00e0 l'ext\u00e9rieur du Qu\u00e9bec'', for a total of 15 awards overall.<ref>\"Jutra judges wild about C.R.A.Z.Y.\". ''[[Montreal Gazette]]'', March 20, 2006.</ref>\n\nIn 2015, [[Toronto International Film Festival]] critics ranked it among the [[Top 10 Canadian Films of All Time]].\n\n==Plot==\nBorn on Christmas in 1959, Zac is one of four and later five brothers: bookish Christian, rebellious Raymond, sporty, flatulent Antoine and then Yvan. He had a special relationship with his father Gervais, but things began to fall apart as Zac's non-masculine ways started to show. Their unique relationship officially came to an end when Gervais comes home to find Zac dressed in his mother's clothes. Ever since then, he \"had unwittingly declared war on his father\".\n\nAt the Christmas party in 1975, Zac shotguns a joint with his cousin Brigitte's boyfriend Paul, which sparks Zac's attraction. His friend Michelle tries to kiss him, but Zac stops her with the excuse of protecting their friendship. Later on, he discovers that Brigitte is no longer with Paul. In a moment of spontaneity, Zac runs a red light on his motorcycle, only to be struck by a car and hospitalized. Zac later learns that Brigitte is back with Paul.\n\nZac begins a relationship with Michelle, temporarily relieving Gervais \u2014 until he sees Zac stepping out of the car with a male classmate, adjusting his crotch. Angry, Gervais has Zac see a [[Psychologist|therapist]] to [[conversion therapy|\"cure\"]] him of his \"homosexuality\". The therapist's conclusion was that Zac made \"a subconscious deliberate mistake\", intentionally doing it so that Gervais would catch him and find out he was \"gay\".\n\nAt the Christmas dinner in 1980, Zac and Michelle's relationship has become closer and more physical. His brother Christian announces his engagement. At Christian's wedding reception, Zac and Paul shotgun a [[joint (cannabis)|joint]] outside, but are seen by a guest who thought they were kissing. Gervais overhears this gossip, and chaos ensues. Gervais confronts Zac in the pouring rain, and Zac admittedly [[coming out|comes out]], yelling that while he was not kissing Paul, he wished he had been. A sobbing, eavesdropping Michelle runs out of hiding, and Gervais tells Zac to leave. Zac flies to Jerusalem. Disgusted with himself after a gay sexual escapade, he walks into the desert and collapses in exhaustion. A [[Bedouin]], who found Zac, drips water on Zac's face and takes Zac into his care.\n\nZac returns home to find his second eldest brother hospitalized after a [[opioid overdose|heroin overdose]], who dies the next day. After the funeral, Gervais hugs Zac emotionally. Ten years after his brother's death, Zac narrates that Gervais \"had become my father once more\", even to the point of allowing his lover into his house.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Marc-Andr\u00e9 Grondin on GOON set crop.JPG|150px|thumb|[[Marc-Andr\u00e9 Grondin]] plays Zachary.]]\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Marc-Andr\u00e9 Grondin]] as Zachary Beaulieu\n* [[Michel C\u00f4t\u00e9 (actor)|Michel C\u00f4t\u00e9]] as Gervais Beaulieu, the father\n* [[Danielle Proulx]] as Laurianne Beaulieu, the mother\n* [[Pierre-Luc Brillant]] as Raymond Beaulieu\n* Alex Gravel as Antoine Beaulieu, Zac's third brother, an athletic boy who has flatulence.\n* Maxime Tremblay as Christian Beaulieu, Zac's studious eldest brother.\n* [[Mariloup Wolfe]] as Brigitte, Zac's first cousin\n* Francis Ducharme as Paul, Brigitte's boyfriend and interest of Zac's\n}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\n[[File:Jean-Marc Vall\u00e9e, Genie Awards 2012.jpg|150px|thumb|Director [[Jean-Marc Vall\u00e9e]] co-wrote the screenplay and assembled the soundtrack.]]\nDirector [[Jean-Marc Vall\u00e9e]] conceived of the film when he and his wife met [[Fran\u00e7ois Boulay]] while staying in a cottage in the [[Eastern Townships]], Quebec.
