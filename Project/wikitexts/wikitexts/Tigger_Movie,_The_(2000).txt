It is the second theatrical ''[[Winnie the Pooh (franchise)|Winnie the Pooh]]'' film after ''[[The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh]]'' and features Pooh's friend [[Tigger]] as the main protagonist searching for his family tree and other Tiggers like himself.\n\nThe film was the first feature-length theatrical Pooh film that was not a collection of previously released shorts.\n\nIt is also the first in the original films in which Tigger is voiced entirely by [[Jim Cummings]] (in addition to Pooh) following the retirement of Tigger's original [[voice actor]] [[Paul Winchell]] in 1999. Winchell was originally cast as Tigger but was dropped after the studio considered his voice to be too raspy. Cummings had previously shared the role with Winchell since 1989 and provided his singing voice in most later projects with Winchell as the character's speaking voice.\n\nThe film features original songs from the [[Sherman Brothers]]. Originally, the film was slated for a [[direct-to-video]] release, until then\u2013Disney CEO [[Michael Eisner]] heard the [[Sherman Brothers]]' songs, and decided to release the film in theaters worldwide. The film received mixed reviews from critics and was the highest-grossing film in the ''[[Winnie the Pooh (franchise)|Winnie the Pooh]]'' franchise until it was surpassed by 2018's ''[[Christopher Robin (film)|Christopher Robin]]''.\n\nThe film received three nominations on the [[Annie Awards]], including the [[Annie Award for Directing in a Feature Production]], the [[Annie Award for Voice Acting in a Feature Production]], and the [[Annie Award for Music in a Feature Production]].\n\n== Plot ==\nTigger interrupts the beginning of the movie, fed up with most of the stories being about Pooh. After rearranging the title page to spell out the movie's title, the story resumes. In the Hundred Acre Wood, Tigger searches for someone to bounce with him, but all of his friends are too busy preparing for the upcoming winter. Tigger's closest friend Roo wants to play with him but arrives too late to do so. While he searches for a playmate, Tigger inadvertently destroys Eeyore's house with a boulder. Rabbit gathers Pooh, Piglet, Kanga, and Roo and they build a mechanical pulley system to remove the boulder, with little success. Tigger arrives and helps out, but his actions wreck the machine and send everyone into a muddy lake (except Roo, who lands in a tree, and Eeyore, who lands in a thorn bush). Frustrated, Rabbit and the rest of Tigger's friends reprimand him for his troublesome rambunctious nature while saying that they are not like him, hurting his feelings. Roo, seeing Tigger's sadness and alienation, asks him if he has any family members of his own. Tigger is fascinated by the concept and decides to search for his family, hoping to finally be within a similar company.\n\nMisunderstanding advice from Owl, Tigger and Roo begin searching for his family tree, believing it to be a centuries-old tree covered in stripes and with many Tiggers upon it. After his search fails, they return to Tigger's house. After finding a golden, heart-shaped locket, they believe that a picture of Tigger's family is inside it. However, the locket is empty. Roo suggests that he writes a letter to his family and he does so. He lets the wind carry it away with hopes that it will reach his family, but receives no response after days of waiting and begins to lose hope. Tigger's sympathetic friends decide to write him a letter; everyone contributes a bit of friendly advice and signs it \"your family\". Tigger misinterprets the content of the letter and comes to believe that his family exists and is intending to visit him, with the others unable to tell him the truth. He organizes a large and absurd party in preparation for a family reunion.\n\nRoo, wishing to uphold Tigger's spirits, encourages his friends to disguise themselves as Tiggers and attend his party. Everyone, but Rabbit, who berates the others for not preparing for the harsh conditions ahead before leaving by ignore to join them, but Roo convinces everyone to continue with the plan.\n\nAfter a great effort in disguising themselves and learning to behave like Tiggers, Tigger's friends arrive at his party. He completely falls for the disguises until Roo's mask falls off after an attempt to imitate a complex bounce that Tigger had taught him earlier. In light of his friends' deception, the disappointed and betrayed Tigger sets out into a [[blizzard]] in search of his real family, taking his letter and locket with him. After falling down a cliff in an attempt to recover his locket, he finds an immense tree that the snow has whitened with stripes, convincing him that it is the family tree he had sought, but is saddened when he finds no one waiting for him there. His friends (joined by Rabbit) set out on an expedition in search of him, but they fail to persuade him to come home. Their argument causes an avalanche, which drives Tigger to rescue his friends by carrying them up into the tree branches. When Tigger has swept away himself, Roo successfully performs Tigger's bounce and saves him. The two perform the bounce together to escape the avalanche and land back on the tree. When the avalanche subsides, Owl and Kanga find them. Christopher Robin also arrives and after finding out what happened, tells Tigger he never needed to go looking for his family. Tigger protests, saying he got a letter from his family. He tries to show it to them but discovers it was lost in the avalanche (it was actually lost before the avalanche happened).\n\nTigger's friends reveal their authorship of the letter by reciting its pieces from memory. Tigger finally realizes that his friends are his true family and he throws a new party in honor of them while handing out presents for them: a new home for Eeyore (made from the family room meant for Tigger's non-existent family), a toy plane for Christopher Robin, a yo-yo for Owl, a hat for Kanga, a large amount of honey for Pooh, lots of firewood for Piglet, a promise to Rabbit that he will watch where he's bouncing from now on (as well as a hug), and the locket for Roo (whom he finally accepts as a brother figure). Christopher Robin then takes a picture of everyone to put inside the locket. The film ends with the newly taken photo shown inside the locket while the camera backs away as it closes up.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Jim Cummings]] as [[Tigger]] and [[Winnie the Pooh (Disney character)|Winnie the Pooh]] \n* [[Nikita Hopkins]] as [[Roo]]\n* [[Ken Sansom]] as [[Rabbit (Winnie-the-Pooh)|Rabbit]]\n* [[John Fiedler]] as [[Piglet (Winnie-the-Pooh)|Piglet]]\n* [[Peter Cullen]] as [[Eeyore]]\n* [[Andre Stojka]] as [[List of Winnie-the-Pooh characters#Owl|Owl]]\n* [[Kath Soucie]] as [[List of Winnie-the-Pooh characters#Kanga|Kanga]]\n* [[Tom Attenborough]] as [[Christopher Robin]]\n* [[John Hurt]] as the Narrator\n\n== Production ==\n[[Paul Winchell]], the original voice of Tigger, was originally cast to voice Tigger for the film, which was then titled ''Winnie the Pooh and the Family Tree''.<ref name=JHMJohnFiedler /> During Spring 1998, Winchell participated in a single recording session for the film.

Their last fully original feature film score was for the [[Academy Award|Oscar]] nominated film, ''[[Bedknobs and Broomsticks]]'' which was released in 1971. ''The Tigger Movie'' would also be the last film work for the Sherman Brothers and [[Robert B. Sherman]] due to his death on March 6, 2012. Originally slated for video or television release, the score was so well received (in demonstration form) by then Disney CEO, [[Michael Eisner]], that the project's priority level moved up to feature theatrical release. This was due in great part to the perceived caliber of the song score throughout the studio. The score of the film is composed by [[Harry Gregson-Williams]] with additional music by [[Klaus Badelt]] and [[Steve Jablonsky]] and the score was conducted by [[Nick Glennie-Smith]].\n\nAll the songs were original ones created for the film except for \"[[The Wonderful Thing About Tiggers]]\" which was originally written in 1968 for the  featurette, ''[[Winnie the Pooh and the Blustery Day]]'' (released in 1968). That song was also by the Sherman Brothers. The \"[[punch line]]\" of the song: \"But the most wonderful Thing About Tiggers is I'm the only one...\" provides the basis of ''The Tigger Movie''{{'}}s storyline. The vast majority of the songs, including \"Someone Like Me\", \"Whoop-de-Dooper Bounce\", \"Pooh's Lullabee\", and \"Round My Family Tree\" were performed by [[Jim Cummings]], while \"How to Be a Tigger\" was performed by the cast.\n\n\"Your Heart Will Lead You Home\" was the last song written for the film and is a collaborative effort between the [[Sherman Brothers]] and singer [[Kenny Loggins]]. Richard Sherman described the song as \"a song about the picture, as opposed to songs of the picture.\" It marks the only time the trio worked together on a song.<ref>Susan King, [https://articles.latimes.com/2000/feb/11/entertainment/ca-63175/2 The Pair Who Write Songs for Nannies and Pooh Bears\"] {{webarchive|url=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20121128073120/http://articles.latimes.com/2000/feb/11/entertainment/ca-63175/2 |date=2012-11-28 }}, ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', February 11, 2000.</ref>\n\nThe original theatrical trailer for the film featured the song \"[[Semi-Charmed Life]]\" by alternative band [[Third Eye Blind]].
