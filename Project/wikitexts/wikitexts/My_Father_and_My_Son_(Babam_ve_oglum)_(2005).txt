The film which went on nationwide release on {{start date|2005|11|18|df=yes}} became one of the highest-grossing Turkish films in history.\n\n==Plot==\nIn order to study [[journalism]] at [[Istanbul University]], Sad\u0131k leaves his village on the [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]] coast.  This angers his father, H\u00fcseyin, who wants him to study [[Agricultural Engineering]] so he can manage the family farm. During his years at university Sad\u0131k becomes a militant in left wing politics. Upon learning about Sad\u0131k's behavior, H\u00fcseyin disowns him.\n\nHowever worse days are ahead for Sad\u0131k.  In the early hours of the morning on [[1980 Turkish coup d'\u00e9tat|12 September 1980]] Sad\u0131k's pregnant wife starts having contractions.  The couple runs outside, but they can't find anyone to take them to the hospital, due to a curfew.  The country has been taken over in a [[military coup]].  Sad\u0131k's wife gives birth in a park and dies, but their son, Deniz, possibly named after leftist youth icon [[Deniz Gezmi\u015f]], survives.\n\nBecause of his political activities, Sad\u0131k is arrested, tortured, and imprisoned for three years during which time he loses his health.  A few years after being released, he finds out that he will die.  Having no other choice, he takes Deniz back to his family farm on the Aegean into the care of his mother and his father, who still does not speak to him.  For Deniz, who is absorbed in the magical world of [[comic books]], meeting his relatives on the farm is a new experience.  There is his grandmother (H\u00fcmeyra Akbay) who drives a tractor and speaks on a [[short wave radio]], his aunt Hanife (Binnur Kaya) who wears bracelets from her wrist all the way to her shoulder, and his uncle (Yetkin Dikinciler) who is a little naive.\n\nThere is trouble in store, however, for Sad\u0131k and H\u00fcseyin who must come to terms with their past and each other.  Sad\u0131k also needs to face his first love, now married with two children, and the question of old friends.  However his sickness takes over and Sad\u0131k passes away.  His parents take over the responsibility of Deniz who comes into term with his father's loss.\n\n==Awards==\nThe film won an award for its soundtrack at the [[World Soundtrack Awards]], awarded to [[Evanthia Reboutsika]].\n\nKu\u015fkan was given the Best actor award at the 25th [[Istanbul Film Festival]] for his performance in ''Babam ve O\u011flum''.<ref name=\"SinemaT\u00fcrk\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.sinematurk.com/person.php?action=goToPersonAwardsPage&id=1411|title=Sinematurk.com: Awards for Fikret Ku\u015fkan|accessdate=2010-07-03|work=sinematurk.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100219192418/http://www.sinematurk.com/person.php?action=goToPersonAwardsPage&id=1411|archive-date=19 February 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Fikret Ku\u015fkan]] \u2013 Sad\u0131k\n* [[\u00c7etin Tekindor]] \u2013 H\u00fcseyin\n* [[H\u00fcmeyra]] \u2013 Nuran\n* [[\u015eerif Sezer]] \u2013 G\u00fclbeyaz Teyze\n* {{Interlanguage link|Ege Tanman|tr}} \u2013 Deniz\n* [[\u00d6zge \u00d6zberk]] \u2013 Birg\u00fcl\n* [[Tuba B\u00fcy\u00fck\u00fcst\u00fcn]] \u2013 Aysun\n* [[Yetkin Dikinciler]] \u2013 Salim\n* [[Binnur Kaya]] \u2013 Hanife\n* [[Halit Ergen\u00e7]] \u2013 \u00d6zkan\n* {{Interlanguage link|Mahmut G\u00f6kg\u00f6z|tr}} \u2013 Kahya\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|0476735|My Father and My Son}}\n* {{rotten-tomatoes|babam_ve_oglum_my_father_and_my_son}}\n* {{cite web |title=My Father and My Son (Babam ve O\u011flum) |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNC7rdAc8kQ&t=1260s |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211219/wNC7rdAc8kQ |archive-date=2021-12-19 |url-status=live|website=youtube.com |accessdate=22 September 2018 |quote=Full HD Free Movie (English Subtitles)}}{{cbignore}}\n\n{{\u00c7a\u011fan Irmak}}\n\n[[Category:2005 films]]\n[[Category:2000s Turkish-language films]]\n[[Category:2005 drama films]]\n[[Category:Turkish drama films]]\n[[Category:Films set in the 1980s]]\n[[Category:Films set in \u0130zmir]]\n[[Category:Films directed by \u00c7a\u011fan Irmak]]\n[[Category:Films shot in \u0130zmir]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Istanbul]]\n[[Category:Films about coups d'\u00e9tat]]"}]}}}}
