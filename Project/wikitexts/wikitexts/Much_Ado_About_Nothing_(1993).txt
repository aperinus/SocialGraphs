[[Kenneth Branagh]], who [[Film adaptation|adapted the play for the screen]] and [[Film director|directed]] it, also stars in the film, which features [[Emma Thompson]], [[Robert Sean Leonard]], [[Denzel Washington]], [[Michael Keaton]], [[Keanu Reeves]], and [[Kate Beckinsale]] in her film debut.\n\nThe film was released on 7 May 1993, reaching 200 U.S. screens at its widest release. It earned $22 million at the [[United States|U.S.]] box office and $43 million worldwide,<ref name=ww/> which, despite failing to reach the mark set by [[Franco Zeffirelli]]'s ''[[Romeo and Juliet (1968 film)|Romeo and Juliet]]'', made it one of the most financially successful Shakespeare films. It was also entered into the [[1993 Cannes Film Festival]].<ref name=\"festival-cannes.com\">{{cite web |url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/2566/year/1993.html |title=Festival de Cannes: Much Ado About Nothing |access-date=2009-08-22|work=festival-cannes.com}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n<!--NOTE: PER WP:FILMPLOT, PLOT SUMMARIES FOR FEATURE-LENGTH FILMS SHOULD BE BETWEEN 400 AND 700 WORDS. The current word count is 638.-->\nHaving just crushed an uprising by his half-brother, Don John, Don Pedro of Aragon and his noblemen visit their friend Leonato in [[Messina]]. Accompanying Don Pedro is the witty Benedick, former acquaintance of Leonato's equally sharp-tongued niece, [[Beatrice (Much Ado About Nothing)|Beatrice]]. Also present are Benedick's friend Claudio, a young count; and Don John who, despite his rebellion, has apparently reconciled with his brother. Claudio has been thinking of Leonato's beautiful daughter [[Hero (Much Ado About Nothing)|Hero]] since before he went to war, and returns to find her as attractive as ever. Don Pedro, learning of his friend's feelings, decides to act on his behalf and arranges the match at a party. An unrepentant Don John attempts to foil it, but unsuccessfully \u2013 the match is made. Needing something to pass the time until the wedding, Don Pedro decides to arrange a similar fate for Beatrice and Benedick, who clearly hate each other.\n\nDon Pedro, Leonato, and Claudio stage a conversation containing a false account of how much Beatrice loves Benedick, all the while knowing Benedick to be hiding within earshot. Hero and her [[gentlewoman|gentlewomen]] Ursula and Margaret play the same trick upon Beatrice. Each of them believes the story they hear about the other. Amidst all the good-natured scheming, Don John has been searching for ways to stop the marriage between Claudio and Hero. The night before the wedding, Don John's servant Borachio arranges a steamy liaison with Hero's gentlewoman Margaret at Hero's chamber window. Don John shows Don Pedro and Claudio this, and they believe that they are seeing Hero in the act of infidelity.\n\nAgainst the revelry of the evening, the upright but incompetent constable [[Dogberry]] appoints a watch to keep the peace. The three hapless watchmen happen to hear Borachio bragging to his colleague Conrade about how he and Don John had succeeded in stopping the wedding. The watchmen apprehend Borachio and Conrade, and, in the morning, Dogberry attempts to have Leonato [[Interrogation|interrogate]] the prisoners. However, a hurried Leonato is unable to decipher what the bumbling Dogberry is trying to tell him.\n\nAt the wedding, Claudio publicly disgraces his would-be bride and storms away, along with most of the guests, except for Ursula, the Friar, Leonato, Beatrice, Antonio, and Benedick. They all agree to the Friar's plan to publish the tale that Hero, upon the grief of Claudio's accusations, suddenly died. Beatrice and Benedick linger a moment and eventually confess their love to one another. In the wake of this declaration, Beatrice asks Benedick to do the one thing that will satisfy her outrage with what has just happened \u2013 kill Claudio. With a heavy heart, he agrees to challenge his friend. Meanwhile, Borachio and Conrade are interrogated by Dogberry and his men. Amidst the confusion, Don John quietly flees. Despite Dogberry's incompetence, the truth of Don John's sinister machinations is revealed.\n\nMoments after Benedick's challenge to Claudio, Leonato is made aware of what really happened. Leonato continues to pretend to Claudio that Hero is dead. Claudio entreats Leonato to impose whatever vengeance he sees fit for Claudio's part in Hero's disgrace and death. Leonato forgives Claudio on the condition that he publicly declare his wrongdoing and then marry Hero's cousin - his brother Antonio's daughter - the next morning. Claudio agrees, and carries out the former by reciting an epitaph at Hero's tomb that night.\n\nWhen the bride is brought forth the next day, she is revealed to be none other than Hero herself. She and Claudio profess their true, undying love for each other, as do Beatrice and Benedick, who agree to marry. Benedick renounces his challenge against Claudio and embraces him. Moments later, Don John is marched in, having been captured before he could escape. Benedick advises that Don Pedro forget about him until tomorrow, after the weddings. Those gathered begin to dance, with the two happy couples at the middle. Don Pedro remains behind, still single, but happy for his friends.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Kenneth Branagh]] as Benedick, a nobleman in the court of Don Pedro. He is fairly arrogant but shows himself to have a good heart during the \"wedding\" scene, as he is the only man from Don Pedro's entourage who implicitly believes Hero. His vanity and brash persona make his interactions with Beatrice argumentative, but at the end of the film, Beatrice and Benedick agree to marry.\n* [[Emma Thompson]] as [[Beatrice (Much Ado About Nothing)|Beatrice]], Leonato's niece, and Hero's cousin and chamber-mate. She is a strong-willed woman who charms and impresses all who know her with her [[wit]] and intelligence. She confesses her love for Benedick and agrees to marry him.\n* [[Robert Sean Leonard]] as Count Claudio, the best friend of Don Pedro and Benedick, and fianc\u00e9 to Hero, with whom he has been in love since before the men went to war against Don John. He does not believe Hero when she protests her innocence, and humiliates her by publicly casting her off during their wedding ceremony.  When Borachio finally confesses and Hero's innocence becomes clear, Claudio is devastated over his part in her \"death\" (as Hero's father leads him to believe).  He agrees to marry Hero's cousin at Leonato's request, and is reunited with his love when it is revealed that \"sweet Hero\" is still alive and now his bride in truth.\n* [[Kate Beckinsale]] as [[Hero (Much Ado About Nothing)|Hero]], the na\u00efve, kind-hearted only child of Governor Leonato, who is in love with Claudio. She is falsely accused of being unfaithful to Claudio on the night before her wedding. At the end of the film, Don John's plot against her and Claudio is revealed and they are happily married as was planned in the beginning.\n* [[Denzel Washington]] as [[Don Pedro (Much Ado About Nothing)|Don Pedro, Prince of Aragon]]; remarkable for being one of the few \"marriageable\" men in the piece who does not get married by the end of the play, though he does play matchmaker for others. In the second act, when he and Beatrice are alone, he quietly asks her, \"will you have me, lady?\", revealing his true feelings for her.  Beatrice gently rebuffs his proposal, and the two remain friends. He believes, with Claudio, in Hero's alleged infidelity, but is likewise earnestly sorry when he learns the truth.\n* [[Keanu Reeves]] as Don John, Don Pedro's evil half-brother. After leading a failed rebellion against Don Pedro, he conspires with his men Borachio and Conrade to stop Hero and Claudio's wedding by ruining Hero's honor. When his plot is found out, he attempts to escape but is captured and imprisoned.\n* [[Richard Briers]] as Leonato, Governor of Messina and the father of Hero. He loves his daughter immensely but upon hearing the false news that she was being unfaithful to Claudio, he wishes she had never been born if that would mean that he would be spared the pain of her disgrace. He eventually listens to the Friar's counsel and becomes party to the pretence that Hero has died in order to test Claudio's remorse over his humiliation of Hero, before finally reuniting the two young lovers in the last act.\n* [[Michael Keaton]] as [[Dogberry]], the local constable. He is not as clever as he thinks he is and has a bad habit for [[malapropism]]s. He solves crimes and misdeeds accidentally. He and his men accidentally catch Borachio boasting about his involvement with separating Claudio and Hero. His men arrest Borachio and his conspiring friends. He ultimately saves the day by forcing Borachio to confess his part in Don John's plot to Leonato.\n* [[Gerard Horan]] as Borachio, Don John's [[Alcoholism|drunken]] henchman. He assists Don John in sabotaging Claudio's and Hero's wedding by making Hero appear unfaithful and initially succeeds, but is caught boasting about his crime by Dogberry's men and forced to confess.\n* [[Imelda Staunton]] as Margaret, Hero's waiting gentlewoman who is tricked by Borachio, and mistaken for Hero by Don Pedro and Claudio.\n* [[Brian Blessed]] as Antonio, the brother of Leonato. He is very friendly, but is incensed by the accusations leveled against Hero.\n* [[Ben Elton]] as Verges, the local [[headborough]] and Dogberry's partner. \n* [[Jimmy Yuill]] as Friar Francis, the priest at Claudio and Hero's wedding who fervently defends Hero from the accusations made against her. \n* Richard Clifford as Conrade, a henchman of Don John.\n* [[Phyllida Law]] as Ursula, Hero's other waiting gentlewoman.\n* [[Patrick Doyle]] as Balthazar, Don Pedro's musician.\n\n==Production==\n{{expand section|date=September 2020}}\n\n===Filming===\n''Much Ado About Nothing'' was filmed entirely in [[Greve in Chianti]] in [[Metropolitan City of Florence|Florence]], [[Tuscany]], [[Italy]].{{citation needed|date=September 2020}}\n\n===Soundtrack===\n<!-- See Wikipedia:WikiProject_Albums -->\n{{Infobox album\n| name       = Much Ado About Nothing\n| type       = [[Film score]]\n| artist     = [[Patrick Doyle]]\n| cover      =\n| alt        =\n| released   = 4 May 1993\n| recorded   = 1993\n| venue      =\n| studio     =\n| genre      = [[Soundtrack]]\n| length     = 59:02\n| label      = Epic Soundtrax\n| producer   =\n| prev_title =\n| prev_year  =\n| next_title =\n| next_year  =\n}}\n{{Album ratings\n| rev1 = [[Filmtracks.com|Filmtracks]]\n| rev1Score = {{Rating|4|5}} [http://www.filmtracks.com/titles/much_ado.html link]\n}}\n\nThe music to ''Much Ado About Nothing'' was composed by frequent [[Kenneth Branagh]] collaborator [[Patrick Doyle]], who makes a brief [[cameo appearance|cameo]] in the film as Balthazar singing ''Sigh No More Ladies'' and ''Pardon, Goddess of the Night''.
