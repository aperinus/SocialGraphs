The film was adapted from Chayefsky's 1978 novel and is his final screenplay. The novel and the film are based in part on [[John C. Lilly]]'s [[sensory deprivation]] research conducted in [[isolation tank]]s, under the influence of [[psychoactive drugs]] like [[mescaline]], [[ketamine]] and [[LSD]].\n\nIt marked the film debuts of [[William Hurt]] and [[Drew Barrymore]]. Chayefsky withdrew from the project after disputes with Russell and took his name off the credits, substituting \"Sidney Aaron,\" his actual first and middle names.\n\nThe [[film score]] was composed by [[John Corigliano]] (with [[Christopher Keene]] conducting). The film was nominated for the [[Academy Awards]] for [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Best Original Score]] and [[Academy Award for Best Sound Mixing|Best Sound]].\n\n==Plot==\nEdward Jessup, a [[Columbia University]] [[psychopathologist]], is studying [[schizophrenia]], and begins to think that \"our [[Altered state of consciousness|other states of consciousness]] are as real as our waking states.\" He begins experimenting with [[sensory deprivation]] using a [[flotation tank]], aided by two like-minded researchers, Arthur Rosenberg and Mason Parrish. At a faculty party, he meets fellow \"whiz kid,\" and his future wife, Emily.\n\nSeven years later, Edward and Emily have two daughters, are on the brink of divorce, and reunite with the couple who first introduced them. When Edward hears of the Hinchi tribe whose members experience shared [[hallucinatory state]]s, he travels to [[Mexico]] to participate in their ceremony. During the climb up into the Hinchi hill country (a plateau covered in spectacular mushroom-shaped [[ventifacts]]) Edward is told by his guide, Eduardo Echeverria, that the Hinchi use in their ceremonies a potion containing the sacred mushroom ''[[Amanita muscaria]]'' and the shrub ''Sinicuiche'' (''[[Heimia salicifolia]]''), which they are collecting for next year's ceremonies. The tribe calls ''Heimia salicifolia'' by a Hinchi name meaning \"first/primordial flower\" in recognition of the deep memory states which it can evoke. An [[Indigenous peoples of Mexico|indigenous]] elder (\"the [[Witchcraft in Latin America|brujo]]\") is seen with a root (presumably intended to be a Heimia root) in his hand, which he asks Edward to hold, before cutting it in order to add some drops of blood to the mixture he is preparing. Immediately after consuming the mixture, Edward experiences bizarre, intense hallucinations, including one of the [[petrifaction]] and subsequent [[erosion]] by blown sand of Emily and himself. The following morning, Edward leaves the Hinchi plateau under a cloud, having killed, while in his intoxicated state, a large specimen of the Hinchi's sacred [[monitor lizard]] (which a [[petroglyph]] shown in the dream sequence shows that they believe to have given them the sacred mushroom in the mythic past). He returns to the U.S. with a sample of the Hinchi potion for analysis by his colleagues and further self-experimentation, and continues taking it in order to take his exploration of altered states of consciousness to a new and higher level.\n\nWhen toxic concentrations of the substance make increased dosage dangerous, Edward returns to [[sensory deprivation]], believing it will enhance the effects of the substance at his current dose. Repairing a disused tank in a medical school, Edward uses it to experience a series of increasingly drastic visions, including one of early [[Hominidae]]. Monitored by his colleagues, Edward insists that his visions have \"externalized\". Emerging from the tank, his mouth bloody, frantically writing notes because he is unable to speak, Edward insists on being [[X-ray]]ed before he \"reconstitutes.\" A [[Radiology|radiologist]] inspecting the X-rays says they belong to a [[gorilla]].\n\nIn later experiments, Edward experiences actual, physical [[biological devolution]]. At one stage he emerges from the isolation tank as a feral and curiously small-statured, light-skinned [[caveman]], going on a rampage through some streets in town and breaking in a [[zoo]] before returning to his natural form. Despite his colleagues' concern, Edward stubbornly continues. In the final experiment, Edward experiences a more profound regression, transforming into an amorphous mass of conscious, primordial matter. An energy wave released from the experiment stuns Edward's colleagues and destroys his tank. Emily arrives to find a swirling maelstrom where the tank had been. She searches into the vortex for Edward, finding him as he is on the brink of becoming a non-physical form of proto-consciousness and possibly disappearing from our version of reality altogether.\n\nHis friends bring Edward home, hoping that the transformations will end. Watched over by Emily, Edward begins to uncontrollably regress again, the transformations no longer requiring the intake of \"first flower\" or sensory deprivation. Urging Edward to fight the change, Emily grabs his hand, immediately being enveloped by the primordial energy emanating from Edward. The sight of Emily apparently being consumed by the energy stirs the human consciousness in Edward's devolving form. He fights the transformation and returns to his human form. Edward embraces Emily, as she returns to normal.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[William Hurt]] as Dr. Eddie Jessup\n* [[Blair Brown]] as Emily Jessup\n* [[Bob Balaban]] as Arthur Rosenberg\n* [[Charles Haid]] as Mason Parrish\n* [[Thaao Penghlis]] as Eduardo Echeverria\n* [[Drew Barrymore]] as Margaret Jessup\n* Megan Jeffers as Grace Jessup\n* [[Dori Brenner]] as Sylvia Rosenberg\n* Peter Brandon as Alan Hobart\n* [[George Gaynes]] as Dr. Wissenschaft\n* [[Jack Murdock (actor)|Jack Murdock]] as Hector Orteco\n* [[Francis X.

They were feeling \"disgruntled\" and as a joke conceived a movie they could make together. They wanted to pitch something to [[Dino De Laurentiis]], who was making ''[[King Kong (1976 film)|King Kong]]''.

Los Angeles Times 19 July 1979: e17.</ref><ref>Russell p 192-208</ref>\n\nItzkoff's book chronicles the making of ''Altered States'' and claims that Russell, objecting to Chayefsky's interference, had the writer banned from the set. Chayefsky reportedly tried to have Russell removed as director, but by then the film was already well underway, and the studio already had replaced one director (Penn). The film's producer, [[Howard Gottfried]], told Chayefsky's biographer Shaun Considine that Russell was polite and deferential prior to production but after rehearsals began in 1979 \"began to treat Paddy as a nonentity\" and was \"mean and sarcastic.\u201d He called Russell a \"duplicitous, mean man.\"<ref name=\"Considine\" />\n\nRussell said Chayefsky \"didn't like the color of the paint on the isolation tank.

He didn't like the lighting, then he didn't like the machinery, then he thought I was making the actors appear drunk in a scene where they were written to be slightly tipsy in a bar&nbsp;...

You either support him or fire him.\"<ref name=\"cost\" />\n\n\"Paddy's hallucinations were impossible to film,\" said Russell in another interview. \"He'd write a direction, something like 'Interstellar gas shot through 5 million miles of universe like a puff of [[Tobacco smoke|cigarette smoke]].' But when I read the script, I realized the picture would only succeed to the extent that it dramatized a certain experience common to all men.

Russell, \"at the height of his alcoholism\", was rebuffed when attempting to change the words, and then \"began purposely trying to destroy Paddy's dialogue by having the actors eat while they were delivering it, or having them deliver it in a staccato, machine-gun kind of style, so that you couldn't make out what they were saying.\" Ezsterhas considered the direction of Russell to have \"destroyed\" the script and film, which was ultimately \"a critical and commercial failure [...] a heartbreaking experience for Chayefsky, who had fought for decades against that, and for protecting his material.

So I was trying to scare him away.\"  The manuscript of ''The Scientist'' (1978) was in the hands of Bantam, the publishers. The head of Bantam called and said, \"Paddy Chayefsky would like to read your manuscript. Will you give him your permission?\" I said, \"Only if he calls me and asks permission.\" He didn't call. But he probably read the manuscript.<ref>http://www.housevampyr.com/training/library/books/omni/OMNI_1983_01.pdf {{Bare URL PDF|date=March 2022}}</ref>\n\nChristopher John reviewed ''Altered States'' in ''[[Ares (magazine)|Ares Magazine]]'' #6 and commented that \"Simply put, ''Altered States'' is very good at what it proposes to do \u2013 luckily it proposed to do very little.\"<ref name=\"Ares\">{{cite journal | last=John | first=Christopher | title=Film & Television | journal=[[Ares (magazine)|Ares Magazine]] | publisher=[[Simulations Publications, Inc.]] | date=January 1981 | issue=6 | pages=10\u201311}}</ref>\n\nIn ''Ready for My Close-Up!: Great Movie Speeches'' (2007), screenwriter [[Denny Martin Flinn]] called Chayefsky's screenplay \"brilliant\" and selected Emily's speech as \"Chayefsky's last great take on life and love.\"<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J5I0Kc6St5sC&pg=PA154|title=Ready for My Close-up!: Great Movie Speeches|page=154|last=Flinn|first=Denny Martin|publisher=Hal Leonard Corporation|date=2007|isbn=978-0879103507}}</ref>\n\nAccording to ''[[TV Guide]]'', [[Basil Dearden]]'s 1963 film ''[[The Mind Benders (1963 film)|The Mind Benders]]'' \"is the direct predecessor of ''Altered States''.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://movies.tvguide.com/the-mind-benders/review/106300 |title=The Mind Benders Review |publisher=Movies.tvguide.com |access-date=2014-03-12}}</ref>\n\n==Awards and honors==\nThe film was nominated for two Academy Awards:<ref name=\"Oscars1981\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/1981 |title=The 53rd Academy Awards (1981) Nominees and Winners |access-date=2011-10-07|work=oscars.org}}</ref>\n* [[Academy Award for Original Music Score|Academy Award for Best Original Score]] \u2013 [[John Corigliano]]\n* [[Academy Award for Best Sound]] \u2013 [[Arthur Piantadosi]], [[Les Fresholtz]], [[Michael Minkler]] and [[Willie D.
