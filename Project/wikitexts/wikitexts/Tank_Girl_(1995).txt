Based on the British [[post-apocalyptic]] comic series of [[Tank Girl|the same name]] created by [[Jamie Hewlett]] and written by [[Alan Martin (writer)|Alan Martin]] that was originally published in ''[[Deadline (magazine)|Deadline]]'' magazine, the film stars [[Lori Petty]], [[Naomi Watts]], [[Ice-T]] and [[Malcolm McDowell]]. ''Tank Girl'' is set in a drought-ravaged [[Australia]], years after a catastrophic [[impact event]]. It follows the [[antihero]] Tank Girl (Petty) as she, Jet Girl (Watts), and [[genetically modified organism|genetically modified]] [[supersoldier]]s called the Rippers fight \"Water & Power\", an oppressive corporation led by Kesslee (McDowell).\n\nAfter reading an issue of the ''Tank Girl'' comic she had received as a gift, Talalay obtained permission from ''Deadline''{{'}}s publisher Tom Astor to direct a [[film adaptation]]. She selected [[Catherine Hardwicke]] to be the [[production designer]], and worked closely with Martin and Hewlett during the making of the film. ''Tank Girl'' was filmed primarily in [[White Sands, New Mexico]], and [[Tucson, Arizona]]. The film's critically praised soundtrack was assembled by [[Courtney Love]], and the Rippers' makeup and [[prosthetics]] team was headed by [[Stan Winston]]. Winston's studio wanted to work on the project so much that they cut their usual prices in half to meet the film's budget.\n\nFinancially unsuccessful, ''Tank Girl'' recouped only about $6 million of its $25 million budget at the box office and received mixed reviews from critics.<ref name=\"metacritic\" /> Martin and Hewlett have since spoken negatively of their experiences creating the film. Talalay blamed some of the film's negative reception on studio edits over which she had no control. Despite the [[box-office bomb|box-office failure]] of the film, it has been cited as an example of a comic-book film with a [[cult following]], and it is noted for its [[Feminism|feminist]] themes.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Please do not add a 'Cast' section. As per MOS:FILM, film article's do not necessarily have to have Cast sections. In the case of this article, it was agreed the Cast section would be merged with the plot. -->\nIn the year 2033, after a decade-long global drought in the wake of a [[Impact event|comet striking the Earth]], the little remaining water is controlled by Kesslee ([[Malcolm McDowell]]) and his Water & Power (W&P) corporation, which subdues the population by monopolising the water supply. Rebecca Buck \u2013 \"Tank Girl\" ([[Lori Petty]]) \u2013 is a member of a commune in the Australian [[outback]] that operates the last [[water well]] not controlled by the corporation. In an attack on the commune, W&P troops kill Tank Girl's boyfriend, Richard ([[Brian Wimmer]]), and capture Tank Girl and her young friend Sam (Stacy Linn Ramsower). Rather than killing her, Kesslee enslaves and tortures the defiant Tank Girl. Jet Girl ([[Naomi Watts]]), a talented but [[Extraversion and introversion|introverted]] jet mechanic who has given up trying to escape W&P, urges Tank Girl to make less trouble for their captors, though Tank Girl refuses. Among other forms of torture, W&P personnel push her down into a long pipe to induce [[claustrophobia]].\n\nThe mysterious Rippers slaughter guards at the W&P compound, then escape. Kesslee uses Tank Girl to lure the Rippers into the open, but they gravely wound him. Tank Girl and Jet Girl escape during the attack. Jet Girl steals a fighter jet from W&P and Tank Girl steals a tank, which she modifies heavily. The girls learn from the eccentric Sub Girl ([[Ann Cusack]]) that Sam is working at a sex club called Liquid Silver. They infiltrate the club, rescue Sam from a [[Pedophilia|pedophile]], Rat Face ([[Iggy Pop]]), and then humiliate the club's owner, \"The Madame\" ([[Ann Magnuson]]), by making her sing [[Cole Porter]]'s \"[[Let's Do It, Let's Fall in Love|Let's Do It]]\" at gunpoint. W&P troops break up the performance and recapture Sam. Tank Girl and Jet Girl wander the desert and find the Rippers' hideout. They learn that the Rippers are [[supersoldier]]s created from human and kangaroo [[DNA]] by a man called Johnny Prophet. Tank Girl befriends a Ripper named Booga ([[Jeff Kober]]), while a Ripper named Donner ([[Scott Coffey]]) shows romantic interest in Jet Girl. Despite the objections of the Ripper T-Saint ([[Ice-T]]), who is suspicious of the girls, the Rippers' leader Deetee ([[Reg E. Cathey]]) sends the pair out to capture a shipment of weapons. The girls bring the weapons crates back, though most of them are empty. After finding Johnny Prophet dead in one of the containers, the girls and the Rippers realize that W&P has tricked them.\n\nThe girls and the Rippers sneak into W&P, where they are ambushed. Kesslee, whose body had been reconstructed by the cybernetic surgeon Che'tsai ([[James Hong]]), reveals that Tank Girl has unknowingly been [[Covert listening device|bugged]]. Deetee sacrifices himself damaging the generator, and in the darkness the Rippers turn the tide of the battle. Jet Girl kills Sergeant Small ([[Donald Patrick Harvey|Don Harvey]]), who had earlier sexually harassed her. Kesslee reveals that Sam is in the pipe, her life endangered by rising water. Tank Girl kills Kesslee, then pulls Sam out of the pipe. The film ends with an animated sequence showing water starting to flow freely. Tank Girl drives down rapids, pulling Booga behind on water skis, then takes them over a waterfall, shouting for joy.\n<!-- Please do not add a 'Cast' section.

She also sees one of the commune's children being abducted, and is herself captured and enslaved. Cartmell also says Tank Girl holds parallels with other \"contemporary '[[Postfeminism|postfeminist]]' icons\", as she displays dominant female sexuality and a \"familiarity and knowing coolness of 'outlawed' modes of sexuality\", such as [[masturbation]], [[sadomasochism]] and lesbianism.{{sfn|Cartmell|1997|pages=41\u201343}}\n\nIn her 2006 book ''The Modern Amazons: Warrior Women On-Screen'', [[Dominique Mainon]] writes that the film has [[The Establishment|antiestablishment]] themes and, unlike many comic-book adaptation films which feature \"gratuitous sexual objectification\" of women, ''Tank Girl'' stands out as being \"stridently feminist\", with the exception of the \"clich\u00e9 victim/avenger complex\".{{sfn|Mainon|2006|page=157}} According to Mainon, the film makes fun of female stereotypes, as shown by Tank Girl's repeated emasculation of Kesslee with witty comebacks while she is being tortured, and by her response to the computer training device telling her how to present herself to men at the Liquid Silver club. The device provides seductive clothing and tells Tank Girl to remove her body hair and to wear make-up and a wig. Tank Girl completely ignores the advice and modifies the clothes to create her own style.{{sfn|Mainon|2006|page=159}}\n\nIn the 2011 book ''Cult Cinema'', Ernest Mathijs and Jamie Sexton discuss the issue of whether cult films purported to be feminist were truly feminist or \"partly the effect of the performance of feminist attitudes in its reception\". The authors consider ''Tank Girl'' to be a \"'real' feminist cult film\", as opposed to the feminist cult films of [[Kathryn Bigelow]] and [[Catherine Hardwicke]], which they consider to be too masculine and too eager to cater to \"hetero-normativity\", respectively.{{sfn|Mathijs & Sexton|2011}}\n\n==Production==\n===Preproduction===\nIn 1988, about a year after the launch of the ''Tank Girl'' comic in the British magazine ''Deadline'', its publisher, Tom Astor, began looking for a studio interested in making a film adaptation. While several studios, including [[New Line Cinema]], expressed interest, progress was slow.{{sfn|Wynne|1995|page=16}} Rachel Talalay's stepdaughter gave her a ''Tank Girl'' comic to read while she was shooting her directorial debut film, ''[[Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare]]'' (released in 1991). Talalay read the comic between takes and became interested in directing a ''Tank Girl'' film.{{sfn|Wynne|1995|page=17}} She contacted Astor and, after hearing nothing for almost a year, was about to give up trying to secure the rights when he gave her permission to make the film.<ref name=commentary>{{cite AV media |people=[[Rachel Talalay]] |year=2013 |title=Director's commentary |medium=Tank Girl Blu-ray}}</ref> Talalay pitched the film to [[Amblin Entertainment]] and [[Columbia Pictures]], which both turned it down. Talalay turned down an offer from [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]], as she did not believe the studio would allow the levels of violence and the sexual references the plot required.<ref name=commentary/> An offer from [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]] was accepted.{{sfn|Wynne|1995|page=20}} Talalay worked closely with the ''Tank Girl'' comic's co-creators Alan Martin and Jamie Hewlett during the film's production, and selected Catherine Hardwicke to be the production designer. The studio was unhappy with Hardwicke, who was relatively unknown at the time, being chosen over more experienced designers, and Talalay had to meet with the producers to persuade them to allow Hardwicke to work on the project.<ref name=toohip /> [[Tedi Sarafian]] wrote the screenplay and [[Gale Tattersall]] was chosen as [[cinematographer]].<ref name=brash/> Believing that MGM would not allow the depiction of a [[Bestiality|bestial]] relationship in the film, the romance between Tank Girl and Booga was only written into the second or third version of the script, after the character was already established in the minds of people involved in the production. By this stage, Booga: \"was a character and not just a kangaroo [so] it wasn't an issue anymore.\"{{sfn|Wynne|1995|page=21}}\n\n===Casting===\nMGM held open casting sessions in London, Los Angeles, and New York for the role of Tank Girl.

Talalay says she fired Lloyd after she refused to cut her hair for the role.<ref name=toohip>{{cite AV media |people=[[Rachel Talalay]] |year=2013 |title=Too Hip For Spielberg: An interview with Director Rachel Talalay |medium=Blu-ray featurette}}</ref><ref name=den/> Lloyd, who had spent four months training for the role, disputes this, saying production had been going well until Talalay found out she was staying at the same hotel as Sarafian. Lloyd says it was a coincidence and she barely spoke to Sarafian, and could only speculate as to why Talalay subsequently became \"frosty with both of [them]\" and then fired her, ostensibly for rescheduling her appointment with the film's hair stylist.{{sfn|Lloyd|2014|pages=141, 142}} Talalay cast Lori Petty, an American, because \"she is crazy in her own life and [the film] needed somebody like that.\"{{sfn|Wynne|1995|page=33}} MGM faxed ''Deadline'' asking them for an \"ideal cast\" list; they selected Malcolm McDowell for Kesslee, but never believed MGM would actually contact him.{{sfn|Wynne|1995|page=34}} McDowell has spoken favorably of his experience working on the film, saying it had the \"same flavour\" as ''[[A Clockwork Orange (film)|A Clockwork Orange]]'', and praised Talalay and Petty.{{sfn|Wynne|1995|page=39}} Talalay was approached by several people who wanted [[Cameo appearance|cameos]] in the film, but she did not want the film to be overshadowed by such appearances. Two cameos were settled on \u2013 Iggy Pop was given the role of Rat Face, and [[Bj\u00f6rk]] was offered Sub Girl. She later dropped out, her character's scenes were rewritten, and the role was then given to Ann Cusack.{{sfn|Wynne|1995|page=35}}\n\n===Filming===\n''Tank Girl'' was filmed over 16 weeks,{{sfn|Wynne|1995|page=78}} in three locations; desert scenes were filmed in White Sands, New Mexico, the Liquid Silver club set was built at an abandoned shopping mall in [[Phoenix, Arizona]],{{sfn|Wynne|1995|page=55}} and all remaining scenes were filmed within 40 miles of Tucson, Arizona.{{sfn|Wynne|1995|page=79}} Many scenes were filmed in an abandoned [[Open-pit mining|open-pit mine]], where filming had to be halted one day due to a chemical leak. Permission was received to film the water pipe scenes at the [[Titan Missile Museum]], near the mine, but the day before shooting, permission was withdrawn. These scenes were filmed, instead, in a tunnel at the abandoned mine. New sets were often found by simply searching the mine.<ref name=chaos>{{cite AV media |people=[[Catherine Hardwicke]] |year=2013 |title=Creative Chaos: Designing the World of Tank Girl with Production Designer Catherine Hardwicke |medium=Blu-ray featurette}}</ref> [[Principal photography]] was completed on September{{nbsp}}27, 1994,<ref name=toohip/> two days over schedule, though still within the original budget.{{sfn|Wynne|1995|page=86}}\n\n===Effects===\n[[File:Tank Girl film tank.jpg|thumb|left|The tank as seen in the film, which featured accessories ranging from lawn chairs to rocket launchers{{sfn|Wynne|1995|page=59}} The rear section of a 1969 [[Cadillac Eldorado]] is visible at the back of the tank.|alt=A screenshot of a heavily modified and accessorised army tank]]\nIn the comics, the Rippers are considerably more kangaroo-like. However, Talalay wanted real actors rather than stuntmen in suits playing the roles. She asked Hewlett to redesign the Rippers to make them more human, allowing them to have the actual actors' facial expressions.{{sfn|Wynne|1995|page=34}} Requests were sent out to \"all the major make-up and effects people\", including Stan Winston, whose prior work included [[Terminator (franchise)|the ''Terminator'' films]], ''[[Aliens (film)|Aliens]]'' and ''[[Jurassic Park (film)|Jurassic Park]]''. Talalay said that while she considered Winston to be the best, she did not expect to hear back from him.{{sfn|Wynne|1995|page=62}} When she did, she still did not think that she would be able to afford his studio on her budget. A meeting was arranged and Winston insisted on being given the project, saying the Rippers would be: \"the best characters we've had the opportunity to do.\"{{sfn|Wynne|1995|page=63}} Winston's studio cut their usual prices in half to meet the film's budget.{{sfn|Wynne|1995|page=63}} Eight Rippers were featured in the film: half were given principal roles, the others were mainly in the background. Each Ripper had articulated ears and tails which were activated by remote control, and the background Rippers also had mechanical snouts which could be activated either by remote control or by the movement of the actors' mouths.{{sfn|Wynne|1995|pages=68\u201369}} Each Ripper's make-up took about four hours to apply. Three technicians from Winston's studio were required to work on each Ripper's articulations during filming; no puppets or digital effects were used for the Rippers.{{sfn|Wynne|1995|page=82}}\n\nThe tank used in the film is a modified [[M3 Stuart#Variants|M5A1 Stuart]]. It was purchased from the government of Peru about 12 years prior to filming and had already been used in several films. Among numerous modifications made for ''Tank Girl'', the tank's 37&nbsp;mm antitank gun was covered with a modified flag pole to give the appearance of a 105&nbsp;mm gun. An entire 1969 [[Cadillac Eldorado]] was added onto the tank, with the rear section welded at the back and the [[Fender (vehicle)|fender]] welded to the front.{{sfn|Wynne|1995|pages=58\u201359}}\n\n===Post-production===\nA \"naked Ripper suit\" incorporating a prosthetic penis was created for Booga and used in a filmed [[Sexual intercourse|postcoital]] scene which was removed from the final version of the film at the studio's insistence.<ref name=commentary /> Deborah Cartmell described the \"postcoital scene\" in the final version, which featured Booga fully clothed, as \"carefully edited\".{{sfn|Cartmell|1997|page=43}} Against Talalay's wishes, the studio made several other edits to the film. The scene in which Kesslee tortures Tank Girl was cut heavily on the grounds that she appeared \"too ugly\" while being tortured. Also cut was a scene showing Tank Girl's bedroom, which was shown to be decorated with dozens of [[dildo]]s, and a scene in which she places a condom on a banana before throwing it at a soldier. The role of Sub Girl was originally intended to be larger; at least two scenes featuring the character were cut from the film, including her appearance in the original ending. The studio cut the original ending, a live-action scene in which it begins to rain; the film was to have ended with Tank Girl burping.<ref name=commentary />\n\n==Soundtrack==\n{{Infobox album\n| name       = Tank Girl \u2013 Original Soundtrack\n| type       = soundtrack\n| artist     = Various artists\n| cover      =\n| alt        =\n| released   = March 28, 1995\n| recorded   = 1994\n| venue      =\n| studio     =\n| genre      = [[Alternative rock]]\n| length     = 41:58\n| label      = [[Warner Bros.
