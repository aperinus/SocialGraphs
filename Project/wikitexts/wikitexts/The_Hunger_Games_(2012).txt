It is the first installment in [[The Hunger Games (film series)|''The Hunger Games'' film series]] and was produced by [[Nina Jacobson]] and Jon Kilik, with a screenplay by Ross, Collins, and [[Billy Ray (screenwriter)|Billy Ray]]. The film stars [[Jennifer Lawrence]], [[Josh Hutcherson]], [[Liam Hemsworth]], [[Woody Harrelson]], [[Elizabeth Banks]], [[Lenny Kravitz]], [[Stanley Tucci]], and [[Donald Sutherland]]. The film is set in a [[Utopian and dystopian fiction|dystopian]] [[Apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction|post-apocalyptic]] future in the nation of [[Panem]], where a boy and a girl from each of the nation's 12 Districts are chosen annually as \"tributes\" and forced to compete in the Hunger Games, an elaborate televised fight to the death. [[Katniss Everdeen]] (Lawrence) volunteers to take her younger sister's place when her sister was initially selected as tribute. With her district's male tribute, [[Peeta Mellark]] (Hutcherson), Katniss travels to the Capitol to train and compete in the Hunger Games.\n\nDevelopment of ''The Hunger Games'' began in March 2009 when [[Lions Gate Entertainment]] entered into a co-production agreement with [[Color Force]], which had acquired the rights a few weeks earlier. Because the novel was written in [[First-person narrative|first-person]] from Katniss' point of view, the writers chose to expand the character of Seneca Crane to allow various plot developments for which Katniss is not present to be shown directly to the audience; Ross also added several scenes between Crane and Coriolanus Snow. The main characters were cast between March and May 2011. Principal photography began in May 2011 and ended that September, with filming taking place in [[North Carolina]].\n\nThe film was released on March 21, 2012 in some European countries, and in the US and UK on March 23, 2012, in both conventional theaters and digital [[IMAX]] theaters.<ref>{{cite web|first=Matt|last=Goldberg|url=https://collider.com/the-hunger-games-imax/142402/|title=The Hunger Games Will Get a One-Week IMAX Run|website=Collider|date=February 2, 2012|access-date=March 8, 2012|archive-date=March 6, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306183644/http://collider.com/the-hunger-games-imax/142402/|url-status=live}}</ref> When the film was released, it set records for opening day ($67.3 million) and opening weekend for a non-sequel. At the time of its release, the film's opening weekend gross ($152.5&nbsp;million) was the third-largest of any film in North America. It is the first film since ''[[Avatar (2009 film)|Avatar]]'' to remain in first place at the North American box office for four consecutive weekends. The film was a massive box-office success by grossing over $694 million worldwide against its budget of $78 million, making it the third-highest-grossing film in the United States and [[2012 in film#Highest-grossing films|ninth-highest-grossing film of 2012]]. It was released on DVD and [[Blu-ray]] on August 18, 2012. The second installment, ''[[The Hunger Games: Catching Fire]]'', was released on November 22, 2013, in the United States.\n\n''The Hunger Games'' received positive reviews from critics, with praise for its themes and messages, emotional depth, as well as Lawrence's portrayal of Katniss and acting; some criticism was leveled at the film's reliance on [[Shaky camera|shaky cam]], especially in the action sequences, and its similarities to other works. The film's soundtrack featured the song \"[[Safe & Sound (Taylor Swift song)|Safe & Sound]]\", which was sung by American singer [[Taylor Swift]] featuring [[The Civil Wars]]; it won a [[Grammy Award for Best Song Written for Visual Media|Grammy Award]] and was nominated for a [[Golden Globe Award]] for [[Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song|Best Original Song]]. For her performance, Lawrence won the [[Saturn Awards|Saturn Award]] for [[Saturn Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]], the [[Broadcast Film Critics Association Award]] for Best Actress in an Action Movie, the [[Empire Award]] for [[Empire Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]] and was also nominated for the [[New York Film Critics Circle Award]] for [[New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]].\n\n==Plot==\n<!--Per [[WP: FILMPLOT]], plot summaries are generally 400 to 700 words only.-->\nThe nation of [[Fictional world of The Hunger Games|Panem]] is divided into 12 districts, ruled from the Capitol. As punishment for a failed revolt, each district is forced to select two tributes, one boy and one girl between the ages of 12 and 18, to fight to the death in the annual Hunger Games until there is only one survivor. <ref group=note>This is directly evocative of the Ancient Greek myth of the [[Minotaur]], wherein [[King Minos]] of [[Crete]] commands that the defeated ancient city-state of [[Athens]] deliver to him seven boys and seven girls every seven years to be devoured in the maze of the [[Labyrinth]] by his wife's unnatural and immortal half-bull, half-man, flesh-eating son, the Minotaur, who is eventually killed by the Greek hero [[Theseus]] with the secret aid of the King's daughter, [[Ariadne]].</ref>\n\nSixteen-year-old [[Katniss Everdeen]] of District 12 volunteers to take her younger sister Primrose's place in the 74th Hunger Games. She and fellow tribute [[Peeta Mellark]] are escorted to the Capitol by their chaperone Effie Trinket and mentor Haymitch Abernathy, the Games' only living winner from District 12. Haymitch stresses the importance of gaining sponsors, as they can provide potentially life-saving gifts during the Games. While training, Katniss observes the \"Careers\" (Marvel, Glimmer, Cato, and Clove), volunteers from the wealthy Districts 1 and 2 who have trained for the Games from an early age. During a televised interview with Caesar Flickerman, Peeta expresses his love for Katniss, which she initially sees as an attempt to attract sponsors; she later learns his admission is genuine.\n\nAt the start of the Games, Katniss grabs some of the supplies placed around the Cornucopia, a structure at the starting point, and narrowly escapes death. Half of the 24 tributes die in the initial melee, and only 11, including all four Careers, survive the first day. Katniss tries to stay away from the others, but Seneca Crane, the Head Gamemaker, triggers a forest fire to drive her towards them. She runs into the Careers, with whom Peeta has seemingly allied, and flees up a tree. Peeta advises the Careers to wait her out. The next morning, Katniss notices Rue, District 11's young female tribute, hiding in an adjacent tree. Rue draws her attention to a nest of [[The Hunger Games universe#Tracker jackers|genetically modified venomous wasps]]. Using a knife, Katniss causes the nest to fall on the Careers sleeping below; Glimmer dies, but the others escape. Katniss becomes disoriented from being stung a few times. Peeta returns and tells her to flee.\n\nRue helps Katniss recover, and they become friends and allies. Katniss destroys the supplies the Careers stockpiled by detonating mines guarding them, while Rue provides a distraction. Katniss later finds and frees Rue from a trap, but Marvel throws a spear which impales Rue. Katniss kills him with an arrow. She comforts Rue by singing to her and, after she dies, adorns her body with flowers, triggering a riot in District 11. President Coriolanus Snow warns Crane about the unrest.\n\nHaymitch persuades Crane to change the rules to allow two winners provided they are from the same district, suggesting that this will pacify the public. After the announcement, Katniss finds a gravely wounded Peeta. Another announcement promises that what each survivor needs the most will be provided at the Cornucopia the next morning. Despite Peeta's vehement opposition, Katniss leaves to get medicine for him, but she is ambushed and overpowered by Clove, who gloats about Rue's death and prepares to dispatch her. [[List of The Hunger Games characters#Thresh|Thresh]], District 11's male tribute, overhears and kills Clove. He spares Katniss once, for Rue's sake. The medicine heals Peeta overnight.\n\nWhile hunting for food, Katniss hears a cannon go off, signaling a death. She races to Peeta, who has unwittingly collected deadly nightlock berries. They discover \"Foxface\", District 5's female tribute, poisoned by the nightlock she collected after watching Peeta. Crane then unleashes genetically modified beasts that kill Thresh and force Katniss, Peeta, and Cato \u2013\u00a0the last three survivors \u2013 to climb onto the Cornucopia's roof. Cato gets Peeta in a headlock and uses him as a human shield against Katniss's bow. Peeta directs Katniss to shoot Cato's hand, enabling Peeta to throw him to the beasts below. Katniss kills him with an arrow to end his suffering.\n\nCrane then revokes the rule change allowing two victors to win. Peeta urges Katniss to shoot him, but she convinces him to eat nightlock berries together. Just before they do, Crane hastily declares them co-victors. Afterward, Haymitch warns Katniss that she has made enemies through these acts of defiance. Snow has Crane locked in a room with nightlock berries, after which the wily President considers his next move.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Jennifer Lawrence SDCC 2015.jpg|thumb|198px|[[Jennifer Lawrence]] dyed her hair to play Katniss in ''The Hunger Games'', but wore a wig for ''Mockingjay Part 1'' and ''2''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/hunger-games-mockingjay-5-secrets-from-the-set-revealed-2014811/#:~:text=2.,for%20the%20first%20two%20films.|website=US Magazine|language=en|access-date=2020-07-03|title=SHHHH! 5 Amazing Secrets Revealed from the Hunger Games: Mockingjay Set|date=November 8, 2014|archive-date=July 2, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200702081930/https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/hunger-games-mockingjay-5-secrets-from-the-set-revealed-2014811/#:~:text=2.,for%20the%20first%20two%20films.|url-status=live}}</ref>]]\n{{See also|List of The Hunger Games characters}}\n{{See also|List of The Hunger Games cast members}}\n<!--Reordered to match billing of primary source: the film -->\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Jennifer Lawrence]] as [[Katniss Everdeen]]\n* [[Josh Hutcherson]] as [[Peeta Mellark]]\n* [[Liam Hemsworth]] as [[Gale Hawthorne]]\n* [[Woody Harrelson]] as [[Haymitch Abernathy]]\n* [[Elizabeth Banks]] as Effie Trinket\n* [[Lenny Kravitz]] as Cinna\n* [[Stanley Tucci]] as Caesar Flickerman\n* [[Donald Sutherland]] as [[List of The Hunger Games characters#President Snow|President Coriolanus Snow]]\n* [[Wes Bentley]] as Seneca Crane\n* [[Toby Jones]] as Claudius Templesmith\n* [[Alexander Ludwig]] as Cato\n* [[Isabelle Fuhrman]] as Clove\n* [[Amandla Stenberg]] as Rue\n* [[Jacqueline Emerson]] as Foxface\n* [[Jack Quaid]] as Marvel\n* [[Leven Rambin]] as Glimmer\n* [[Dayo Okeniyi]] as Thresh\n* [[Willow Shields]] as [[List of The Hunger Games characters#Primrose Everdeen|Primrose Everdeen]]\n* [[Paula Malcomson]] as Mrs. Everdeen\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nIn March 2009, [[Lions Gate Entertainment]] (known as Lionsgate) entered into a co-production agreement for ''[[The Hunger Games]]'' with [[Nina Jacobson]]'s production company [[Color Force (film company)|Color Force]], which had acquired worldwide [[film distribution|distribution rights]] to the novel a few weeks earlier,<ref name=\"Lionsgate\">{{cite news | title=Lionsgate picks up 'Hunger Games' | url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-hunger-idUSTRE52H0LK20090318 | newspaper=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] | date=March 17, 2009 | access-date=April 6, 2011 | author=Jay A.

Ross explained, \"In the book, Katniss speculates about the game-makers' manipulations&nbsp;... in the film, we can't get inside Katniss's head, but we do have the ability to cut away and actually show the machinations of the Capitol behind the scenes. I created the game centre and also expanded the role of Seneca Crane for those reasons. I thought it was totally important.\"<ref name=\"nyt-qanda\" /> Ross also added several scenes between Crane and Coriolanus Snow, the elderly President of Panem, noting that \"I thought that it was very interesting that there would be one generation [of Panem citizens] who knew that [the Games] were actually an instrument of political control, and there would be a successive generation who was so enamoured with the ratings and the showbiz and the sensations and the spectacle that was subsuming the actual political intention, and that's really where the tension is\".<ref name=\"kcrw\">{{cite podcast |url=http://www.kcrw.com/news-culture/shows/the-treatment/gary-ross-the-hunger-games |title=Gary Ross: The Hunger Games |website=KCRW |publisher=[[KCRW]] |date=March 21, 2012 |access-date=June 5, 2015 |archive-date=July 16, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150716230908/http://www.kcrw.com/news-culture/shows/the-treatment/gary-ross-the-hunger-games |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nThe Gamemakers' control center, about which Katniss can only speculate in the novel, was also developed as a location, helping to remind the audience of the artificial nature of the arena.
