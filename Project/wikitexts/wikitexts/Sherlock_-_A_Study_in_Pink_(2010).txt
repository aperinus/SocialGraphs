Thank you. -->\n[[List of Sherlock characters#Dr. John Watson|John Watson]], an [[Royal Army Medical Corps|army doctor]] injured in [[War in Afghanistan (2001\u2013present)|Afghanistan]], meets [[List of Sherlock characters#Sherlock Holmes|Sherlock Holmes]], who is looking for a flatmate to share a flat at [[221B Baker Street]], owned by landlady [[List of Sherlock characters#Mrs. Hudson|Mrs. Hudson]]. The police, led by [[List of Sherlock characters#Detective Inspector Greg Lestrade|Detective Inspector Lestrade]], have been baffled by a series of deaths, described as \"serial suicides\". Holmes looks at the latest crime scene: the body of Jennifer Wilson, who was dressed in pink. She managed to claw the word \"Rache\" into the floor, and Sherlock reckons the victim died before completing the name \"Rachel\", the name of her deceased daughter. Holmes deduces she is from out of town and therefore had a suitcase. The police have not found a carry-on with the body, but Holmes discovers it abandoned nearby. Meanwhile, after a phone call, Watson is compelled to meet a man who claims to be Holmes's \"arch-enemy\". The man offers him money to spy on Holmes, but Watson refuses. He also tells Watson that he misses the war, not suffering from [[post-traumatic stress disorder]] as his therapist believes.\n\nWhen Watson returns to Baker Street, Holmes asks him to text Wilson's still-missing phone, hoping the murderer will make a move. While waiting at a local restaurant, Holmes notices a taxi and they  outpace it on foot with shortcuts. However, the passenger is innocent. Holmes presumes \"Rachel\" was Wilson's e-mail password, and the victim planted her phone on the killer so GPS could trace him. At the same time, Watson finds the signal is coming from 221B Baker Street; Mrs. Hudson tells Holmes a taxi is waiting for him. Outside, the cabbie confesses to the murders but proclaims he merely speaks to his victims, and they kill themselves. The cabbie challenges Holmes to solve his puzzle. Later, he pulls out two bottles containing an identical pill: one is harmless, the other is poison. Afterward, he invites the victims to choose one, promising he will swallow the other \u2014 and he threatens to shoot them if they refuse.\n\nSherlock soon deduces the driver is an estranged father who was told three years earlier he was dying. The driver admits that he has a \"sponsor\" for his work, paying money for each murder for the driver's children. Holmes, having already noticed that the 'gun' is a novelty cigarette lighter, attempts to leave. However, the driver rechallenges him to choose a pill and see if he can solve the puzzle. Meanwhile, Watson has traced the GPS signal from the phone and followed the two men. He shoots the driver through a window in the adjacent building. Holmes tortures the cabbie to force him to say whether the pill taken was correct and who the sponsor is. He eventually reveals the name \"[[List of Sherlock characters#Jim Moriarty|Moriarty]]\". The police arrive, and Holmes deduces the shooter is Watson but hides the truth from the police. Holmes and Watson leave the scene and run into the enigmatic man who claims to be Sherlock's arch-enemy earlier. He turns out to be Sherlock's elder brother, [[List of Sherlock characters#Mycroft Holmes|Mycroft]], who works for the British government. Watson finally understands that Mycroft tried to bribe him out of genuine concern for Sherlock. Mycroft instructs his secretary to increase their surveillance status.\n\n==Allusions==\nThe episode is loosely based on ''[[A Study in Scarlet]]'' and contains allusions to other works by Arthur Conan Doyle. Moffat said of \"A Study in Pink\" and ''A Study in Scarlet'': \"there are many elements of the story, and the broad shape of it, but we mess around with it a lot\".<ref name=\"den of geek\">{{cite web|first=Michael|last=Leader|url=http://www.denofgeek.com/television/544043/steven_moffat_and_mark_gatiss_interview_sherlock.html|title=Steven Moffat and Mark Gatiss interview: Sherlock|publisher=Den of Geek|date=21 July 2010|accessdate=4 May 2012}}</ref> Tom Sutcliffe of ''The Independent'' points out, \"Fans will recognise at once that the close-reading Sherlock applies to John's mobile phone is drawn from an almost identical analysis of a pocket watch [taken from ''[[The Sign of the Four]]''].

In the original story, Holmes dismisses a suggestion that the victim was trying to write \"Rachel\", instead pointing out that \"Rache\" is German for \"revenge\". In this version Holmes's interpretation is reversed: he scoffs at the \"revenge\" explanation and suggests the victim was trying to write \"Rachel\".\n\nThe \"three-patch problem\" that Holmes describes is similar to the term \"three-pipe problem\" he uses in \"[[The Red-Headed League]]\".<ref name=\"dyk\">{{cite web|url=http://www.bbcentertainment.com/za/programmes/sherlock/facts/ |title=Sherlock&nbsp;\u2014 did you know? |publisher=[[BBC Entertainment]] |accessdate=4 May 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120203002653/http://www.bbcentertainment.com/za/programmes/sherlock/facts |archive-date= 3 February 2012 }}</ref>\n\nThe mention by Mrs. Hudson of \"Mrs. Turner who lives next door\" is a reference to a point in \"[[A Scandal in Bohemia]]\", where Holmes' landlady is once named as Mrs. Turner, instead of as Mrs. Hudson.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\nThe feverish shout of \"The game, Mrs. Hudson, is on!\" is a reference to a line in \"[[The Adventure of the Abbey Grange]]\", \"The game is afoot\", which is frequently accredited to Holmes in adaptations. In the 2013 mini-episode \"Many Happy Returns\", a newspaper headline tantalisingly reads \"The game is back on\" as a harbinger of the character's imminent return.\n\nThe cabbie is dying of a brain aneurysm, while the murderer in ''A Study in Scarlet'' is dying of an [[aortic aneurysm]].\n\nWatson's reference in the final scene to having been shot in the shoulder but developing a [[psychosomatic]] limp in the leg is an allusion to a continuity error in the Conan Doyle stories: in the original ''A Study in Scarlet'' Watson's injury is said to be in his shoulder, but in Conan Doyle's later Holmes stories, it is said to be in his leg.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\nThe second murder victim's name is James Phillimore, a reference to a case Holmes failed to solve in \"[[The Problem of Thor Bridge]]\".\n\nThe text messages Holmes sends Watson are taken nearly word for word from a telegram Holmes sends Watson in \"[[The Adventure of the Creeping Man]]\".\n\nThe case Holmes is working on when he meets Watson involves a guilty brother with a green ladder. This is an apparent reference to an unfinished story found after Conan Doyle's death since completed as \"The Adventure of the Tall Man\" and included (sometimes as only the original outline) in some editions of the Sherlock Holmes Apocrypha.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\n==Production==\nThe story was originally filmed as a 60-minute pilot for ''Sherlock'', directed by [[Coky Giedroyc]].
