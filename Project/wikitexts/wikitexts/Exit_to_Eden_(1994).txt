The original music score was composed by [[Patrick Doyle]].\n\n[[Dana Delany]] stars as Lisa Emerson (named Lisa Kelly in the book) and [[Paul Mercurio]] plays Elliot Slater. Half of the film consists of a new [[comedy|comedic]] [[detective]] story line written by the director. Several new characters were also created, including [[Dan Aykroyd]] and [[Rosie O'Donnell]] as police officers pursuing diamond thieves to the Eden resort.\n\n==Plot==\nElliot Slater is a young, attractive, Australian professional photographer living in Southern California. Having always been uncomfortable with his sexual proclivities, which tend toward the [[BDSM]] realm, he signs up for a [[dominatrix]]-themed vacation on a private tropical island known as \"Eden\" in the hopes of working through his discomfort.\n\nUnbeknownst to him, before embarking on his journey of sexual discovery, he has unwittingly photographed an international jewel thief of whom no other photos exist. The jewel thief Omar and his criminal partner Nina are intent on recovering the film in order to retain Omar's anonymity.\n\nThey follow the photographer to the island resort run by the dominatrix, Mistress Lisa Emerson, posing as vacationers. Following a tip that Omar is on the island, undercover police officers Fred Lavery and Sheila Kingston also arrive, Sheila in the guise of a vacationer and Fred as a handyman. When a submissive asks Sheila what he can do to please her, she tells him to go paint her house.\n\nComedic antics ensue amid the activities of scantily clad guests and employees, acting out their dominant and submissive [[Fantasy (psychology)|fantasies]].\n\nIn the course of Elliot's experiences as Mistress Lisa's personal submissive, including a scene where she ties him up and fondles his naked body (especially, his bare buttocks, which she also spanks), the two begin to fall in love. The action comes to a climax on a quick trip to [[New Orleans]], where Lisa reluctantly admits her feelings for Elliot, all the while tailed by Omar, who attempts to kill them.\n\nFred and Sheila save the day, sending Omar and Nina to jail, and receive commendations for solving the case. Elliot returns to Eden and proposes to Lisa, who says yes. Also, the submissive who spoke to Sheila makes good on her request: he has her house painted.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Dana Delany]] as Lisa Emerson\n* [[Paul Mercurio]] as Elliot Slater\n* [[Rosie O'Donnell]] as Sheila Kingston\n* [[Dan Aykroyd]] as Fred Lavery\n* [[Hector Elizondo]] as Dr. Martin Helifax; credited \"As usual Hector Elizondo\".\n* [[Stuart Wilson (actor)|Stuart Wilson]] as Omar\n* [[Iman (model)|Iman]] as Nina Blackstone\n* [[Sean O'Bryan]] as Tommy Miller\n* [[Stephanie Niznik]] as Diana\n* Phil Redrow as Richard\n* Sandra Taylor as Riba\n* Julie Hughes as Julie\n* [[Laura Harring]] as M.C.

Milkis]] before his death in 1996.\n\n==Reception==\nThe film garnered attention during its release because of the BDSM themes, full frontal female nudity (including Delany), and because of the high profiles of the director, cast members, and the author. Promotional materials for the film included photos of Delany in dominatrix attire.\n\nIt was generally panned by critics, who expressed disappointment and confusion about the combination of the original story and the comedic elements.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.timeout.com/film/64106.html|title=Exit to Eden|website=Time Out London|access-date=2016-04-05}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/exit_to_eden/|title=Exit to Eden|date=1994-10-14|website=www.rottentomatoes.com|access-date=2016-04-05}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://movie-reviews.colossus.net/movies/e/exit_eden.html |title=Related Pages |publisher=Movie-reviews.colossus.net |access-date=2012-09-01 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120229040007/http://movie-reviews.colossus.net/movies/e/exit_eden.html |archive-date=2012-02-29 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9503E0D8143CF937A25753C1A962958260|title=Movie Review - Smuggling as Afterthought to S-and-M|website=www.nytimes.com|access-date=2016-04-05}}</ref> The film maintains a 5% \"rotten\" rating at [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on 19 reviews, with an average score of 3.2/10.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/exit_to_eden/|title=Exit to Eden (1994)|publisher=Rotten Tomatoes|access-date=2019-08-06}}</ref> [[Roger Ebert]] gave the film \u00bd star out of four possible stars.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19941014/REVIEWS/410140301/1023 |title=Exit To Eden :: rogerebert.com :: Reviews |publisher=Rogerebert.suntimes.com |date=1994-10-14 |access-date=2012-09-01 |archive-date=2012-10-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121007062237/http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F19941014%2FREVIEWS%2F410140301%2F1023 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nThe film was not a financial success either, opening with a gross for the weekend of $3 million and a total gross of $6.8 million, which led to the company recognising a loss.<ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Daily Variety]]|date=October 18, 1994|page=4|title='Exit' Sign: Poor B.O. saps Savoy|last=Greene|first=Jay}}</ref>\n\nOne controversy occurred when it was initially [[Ban (law)|banned]] by the [[Saskatchewan Film and Video Classification Board]].
