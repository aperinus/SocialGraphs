It explores the relationship that develops between the two men after journalist Finkel begins to meet with Longo in prison.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 2001, [[Christian Longo]], an [[Oregon]] man whose wife and three children have been discovered murdered, is arrested by police in Mexico, where he had been identifying himself as a reporter for ''[[The New York Times]]'' named [[Michael Finkel]]. Meanwhile, in [[New York City]], Finkel, an ambitious and successful reporter, is confronted by his editors about a cover story he has written for ''[[New York Times Magazine]]'' in which he has used a [[composite character]] as the focus of his story, violating basic journalism principles. Finkel briefly attempts to defend his actions but is unsuccessful and is fired. He returns home to his wife Jill and struggles to find work as a journalist due to his public firing from the ''Times''.\n\nIn 2003, Finkel is contacted by a reporter for ''[[The Oregonian]]'', seeking his opinion on Longo's assumption of his identity. Unaware of Longo's case, Finkel is intrigued and arranges to meet Longo in prison. During their first conversation, Longo claims he has followed Finkel's career and admired his writing. Longo agrees to tell Finkel his side of the crimes he is accused of in exchange for writing lessons and Finkel's promise not to share their conversations until after the conclusion of the murder trial.\n\nFinkel becomes increasingly absorbed with Longo, who is likable but evasive about his guilt. Convinced the story will be redemptive, Finkel visits Longo in prison and corresponds with him for several months. Longo sends Finkel numerous letters and an 80-page notebook entitled \"Wrong Turns,\" which contains what Longo describes as a list of every mistake he has made. Finkel begins to recognize similarities between Longo and himself, their handwriting and drawing, and Longo's letters and Finkel's journals. As the trial approaches, Finkel becomes increasingly doubtful that Longo is guilty of the murders, and Longo informs Finkel that he intends to change his plea to not guilty.\n\nIn court, Longo pleads not guilty to two of the murders but pleads guilty to the murder of his wife and one of his daughters. Finkel confronts Longo, who claims he cannot share everything he knows because he has to protect certain people he refuses to name. Greg Ganley, the detective who tracked Longo down and arrested him, approaches Finkel and claims Longo is an extremely dangerous and manipulative man. He tries to convince Finkel to turn over as evidence all his correspondence with Longo. Finkel refuses, and Ganley does not press him for an explanation.\n\nAt the trial, Longo takes the stand and describes his version of the events in detail. After an argument with his wife about their financial situation, he claims he had come home to discover two of his children missing, one of his daughters unconscious, and his wife sobbing, saying she put the children \"in the water.\" Longo says he strangled his wife to death in a blind rage. He says he thought his other daughter was dead at first but realized she was still breathing and strangled her as well because she was all but dead. Finkel's wife, Jill, watches Longo's testimony. As the jury deliberates, Jill visits Longo in jail and tells him he is a narcissistic murderer who will never escape who he is.\n\nLongo is found guilty and sentenced to death. After he is sentenced, he winks at Finkel, who, to his shock and rage, realizes Longo has been lying throughout their conversations, using him to make his testimony more believable. A short time later, Finkel meets Longo on death row. Longo tries to convince Finkel he discovered his wife strangling their daughter and then blacked out, so he has no memory of the murders. Finkel angrily tells Longo he will not believe any more of his lies and will warn the judge, when Longo appeals against his sentence, of Longo's manipulative nature. Longo retorts by pointing out Finkel's success with his book about their encounters, leaving the reporter shaken.\n\nFinkel reads a section of his book, ''True Story'', at a promotional event in a bookstore. Taking questions from the audience, he imagines Longo standing in the back of the room. Finkel is unable to respond. Longo says if he has lost his freedom, Finkel must have also lost something.\n\nA year later, title cards reveal that Longo admitted to killing his entire family. The final title card says Finkel and Longo still speak on the first Sunday of every month. Finkel never wrote for the ''Times'' again, but Longo has contributed articles to several publications from death row, including the ''Times''.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=18em}}\n* [[Jonah Hill]] as [[Michael Finkel]]\n* [[James Franco]] as [[Christian Longo]]\n* [[Felicity Jones]] as Jill Barker\n* [[Robert John Burke]] as Greg Ganley\n* Connor Kikot as Zachary Longo\n* [[Gretchen Mol]] as Karen Hannen \n* [[Betty Gilpin]] as Cheryl Frank\n* [[John Sharian]] as Lincoln County Lobby Sheriff\n* [[Robert Stanton (actor)|Robert Stanton]] as Jeffrey Gregg\n* [[Maria Dizzia]] as Mary Jane Longo\n* [[Genevieve Angelson]] as Tina Alvis\n* [[Dana Eskelson]] as Joy Longo\n* [[Ethan Suplee]] as Pat Frato\n* Joel Garland as Dan Pegg\n* [[Rebecca Henderson (actress)|Rebecca Henderson]] as Ellen Parks\n* Charlotte Driscoll as Sadie Longo\n* [[Maryann Plunkett]] as Maureen Duffy\n* [[David Pittu]] as Marcus Lickermann\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n===Filming===\n[[Principal photography]] began in March 2013 in [[Warwick, New York]] and [[New York City]].<ref>{{cite news|title=New Regency To Finance ''True Story'' With Jonah Hill And James Franco|url=https://www.deadline.com/2012/03/new-regency-to-finance-true-story-with-jonah-hill-and-james-franco/|access-date=July 1, 2013|newspaper=deadline.com|date=March 29, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=First look at Jonah Hill & Felicity Jones filming ''True Story'' in NYC|url=http://www.onlocationvacations.com/2013/03/21/first-look-at-jonah-hill-felicity-jones-filming-true-story-in-nyc/|access-date=July 1, 2013|newspaper=onlocationvacations.com|date=March 21, 2013|archive-date=June 3, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170603140218/http://www.onlocationvacations.com/2013/03/21/first-look-at-jonah-hill-felicity-jones-filming-true-story-in-nyc/|url-status=dead}}</ref> [[Brad Pitt]] produced, along with several others, and [[Fox Searchlight Pictures]] distributed.<ref>{{cite news|title=The Brad Pitt-produced movie ''True Story'' is filming in Warwick, NY this week|url=http://www.onlocationvacations.com/2013/03/07/the-brad-pitt-produced-movie-true-story-is-filming-in-warwick-ny-this-week/|access-date=July 1, 2013|newspaper=onlocationvacations.com|date=March 7, 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Music===\n[[Marco Beltrami]] was hired on July 18, 2014, to write the film's music.<ref>{{cite news|title=Marco Beltrami to Score ''True Story'' |url=http://filmmusicreporter.com/2014/07/18/marco-beltrami-to-score-true-story/|access-date=July 19, 2014| publisher=filmmusicreporter.com| date=July 18, 2014}}</ref>\n\nWhen Jill visits Longo in prison, she plays him a recording of \"Se la mia morte brami\" (If you desire my death), a madrigal by the Italian renaissance composer [[Carlo Gesualdo]].
