It sees Bond suspended from MI6 as he pursues the [[drug lord]] Franz Sanchez, who has ordered an attack against Bond's [[CIA]] friend [[Felix Leiter]] and the murder of Felix's wife after their wedding.\n\n''Licence to Kill'' was the fifth and final Bond film directed by [[John Glen (director)|John Glen]], the last to feature [[Robert Brown (British actor)|Robert Brown]] as [[M (James Bond)|M]] and [[Caroline Bliss]] as [[Miss Moneypenny]]. It was also the last to feature the work of the screenwriter [[Richard Maibaum]], the title designer [[Maurice Binder]] and the producer [[Albert R. Broccoli]], all of whom died in the following years. \n\n''Licence to Kill'' was the first Bond film to not use the title of an [[Ian Fleming]] story. Originally titled ''Licence Revoked'', the name was changed during post-production due to American [[Test audience|test audiences]] associating the term with [[driver's license]]. Although its plot is largely original, it contains elements of the Fleming novel ''[[Live and Let Die (novel)|Live and Let Die]]'' and the short story \"[[For Your Eyes Only (short story collection)#The Hildebrand Rarity|The Hildebrand Rarity]]\", interwoven with a sabotage premise influenced by [[Akira Kurosawa]]'s film ''[[Yojimbo]]''. \n\nFor budget reasons, ''Licence to Kill'' became the first Bond film shot entirely outside the United Kingdom: [[principal photography]] took place on location in Mexico and the US, while interiors were filmed at [[Estudios Churubusco]] instead of [[Pinewood Studios]]. The film earned over $156&nbsp;million worldwide and received generally positive reviews, with praise for the stunts, but attracted criticism for its darker tone, which carried into Dalton's portrayal of Bond.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, the plot summary should be between 400-700 words. -->\n[[Drug Enforcement Administration|DEA]] agents collect [[MI6]] agent [[James Bond]] and his friend, [[CIA]] agent [[Felix Leiter]], on their way to Leiter's wedding in [[Key West]], to have them assist in capturing [[drug<!-- do not remove the plural 's' in 'drugs' -->s lord]] Franz Sanchez. Bond and Leiter capture Sanchez by attaching a hook and cord to Sanchez's plane and pulling it out of the air with a [[United States Coast Guard|Coast Guard]] helicopter. Afterwards, Bond and Leiter parachute down to the church in time for the ceremony.\n\nSanchez bribes DEA agent Ed Killifer and escapes. Meanwhile, Sanchez's henchman Dario and his crew ambush Leiter and his wife Della and take Leiter to an aquarium owned by one of Sanchez's accomplices, Milton Krest. Sanchez has Leiter lowered into a tank holding a [[tiger shark]]. When Bond learns that Sanchez has escaped, he returns to Leiter's house to find that Leiter has been maimed and that Della has been murdered (and by implication raped).{{sfn|Black|2005|p=152}}{{sfn|Chapman|2007|p=206}} Bond, with Leiter's friend Sharkey, start their own investigation. They discover a marine research centre run by Krest, where Sanchez has hidden cocaine and a submarine for smuggling.\n\nAfter Bond kills Killifer using the same shark tank used for Leiter, [[M (James Bond)|M]] meets Bond in Key West's [[Ernest Hemingway House|Hemingway House]] and orders him to an assignment in [[Istanbul]], Turkey. Bond resigns after turning down the assignment, but M suspends Bond instead and revokes his [[Licence to kill (concept)|licence to kill]]. Bond becomes a [[wikt:rogue|rogue]] agent, although he later receives unauthorised assistance from [[Q (James Bond)|Q]].\n\nBond boards Krest's ship ''Wavekrest'' and foils Sanchez's latest drug shipment, stealing five million dollars in the process. He discovers that Sharkey has been killed by Sanchez's henchmen. Bond meets and teams up with Pam Bouvier, a pilot and DEA informant, at a [[Bimini]] bar,<ref>{{cite web |title=Licence To Kill film locations |year=2014 |publisher=Worldwide Guide to Movie Locations |url=http://www.movie-locations.com/movies/l/LicenceToKill.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100131140344/http://movie-locations.com/movies/l/LicenceToKill.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=31 January 2010 |access-date=26 July 2015 }}</ref> and journeys with her to the Republic of Isthmus. He seeks Sanchez's employment by posing as an assassin for hire. Two [[Hong Kong Police Force|Hong Kong Narcotics Bureau]] officers foil Bond's attempt to assassinate Sanchez and take him to an abandoned warehouse. They are joined by Fallon, an MI6 agent who was sent by M to apprehend Bond. Sanchez's men rescue him and kill the officers, believing them to be the assassins. Later, with the aid of Bouvier, Q, and Sanchez's girlfriend Lupe Lamora, Bond [[frameup|frames]] Krest by planting the $5&nbsp;million in ''Wavekrest''. Sanchez shuts Krest into a decompression chamber and cuts the oxygen cord, causing Krest to [[Explosive decompression|explosively decompress]] to his death. Bond is then admitted into the inner circle.\n\nSanchez takes Bond to his base, which is disguised as the headquarters of a religious cult. Bond learns that Sanchez's scientists can dissolve [[cocaine]] in [[gasoline|petrol]] and then sell it disguised as fuel to Asian drug dealers. The [[televangelist]] Joe Butcher serves as middleman, working under Sanchez's business manager Truman-Lodge, who uses Butcher's TV broadcasts to communicate with Sanchez's customers in the United States. During Sanchez's presentation to potential Asian customers, Dario enters the room and recognises Bond. Bond starts a fire in the laboratory, but is captured again and placed on the conveyor belt that drops the brick-cocaine into a giant [[Industrial shredder|shredder]]. Bouvier arrives and shoots Dario, allowing Bond to pull Dario into the shredder, killing him.\n\nSanchez and most of the others flee as fire consumes his base, taking with him four tankers full of the cocaine and petrol mixture. Bond pursues them by plane, with Bouvier at the controls. During the course of a stunt-filled chase through the desert, Bond destroys three of the tankers and kills several of Sanchez's men. Sanchez attacks Bond with a machete aboard the final remaining tanker, which crashes down a hillside. A petrol-soaked Sanchez attempts to kill Bond with his machete. Bond then reveals his cigarette lighter\u2014the Leiters' gift for being the best man at their wedding\u2014and sets Sanchez on fire. Sanchez stumbles into the wrecked tanker, causing a big explosion and killing himself. Bouvier arrives shortly afterward, and picks up Bond.\n\nLater, a party is held at Sanchez's former residence. Bond receives a call from Leiter telling him that M has congratulated him for his work and offers him his job back. He then rejects Lupe's advances and romances Bouvier instead.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Timothy Dalton]] as [[James Bond in film|James Bond 007]], an [[Secret Intelligence Service|MI6]] agent who resigns to take his revenge on drug lord Franz Sanchez.\n<!-- opening title cards -->\n* [[Carey Lowell]] as Pam Bouvier, an ex-[[United States Army|Army]] pilot, and [[DEA]] informant.\n* [[Robert Davi]] as Franz Sanchez, the most powerful drug lord in Latin America, mentioned as having been wanted by the [[Drug Enforcement Administration|DEA]] for years.\n* [[Talisa Soto]] as Lupe Lamora, Sanchez's girlfriend who has romantic feelings for Bond.\n* [[Anthony Zerbe]] as Milton Krest, Sanchez's henchman who operates Wavekrest Marine Research, and whom Bond sets up to turn Sanchez against him\n* [[Everett McGill]] as Ed Killifer, a corrupt DEA agent who frees Sanchez from custody.\n* [[Frank McRae]] as Sharkey, a friend of Felix Leiter who owns a boat charter business.\n* [[Desmond Llewelyn]] as [[Q (James Bond)|Q]], Bond's ally who supplies Bond with various gadgets and helps him in the field.\n* [[Robert Brown (British actor)|Robert Brown]] as [[M (James Bond)|M]], the head of MI6 and Bond's superior who revokes Bond's double-0 licence <!-- (This was Robert Brown's 4th and final appearance as M) -->\n* [[Caroline Bliss]] as [[Miss Moneypenny]], M's personal secretary.\n* [[Anthony Starke]] as Truman-Lodge, Sanchez's financial advisor.\n* [[Grand L.

Broccoli]] and writers [[Michael G. Wilson]] and Richard Maibaum started discussing its successor. The film would retain a realistic style, as well as showing the \"darker edge\" of the Bond character. For the primary location, the producers wanted a place where the series had not yet visited.<ref name=documentary/> While China was visited after an invitation by its government, the idea fell through partly because the 1987 film ''[[The Last Emperor]]'' had removed some of the novelty from filming in China.{{sfn|Barnes|Hearn|2001|p=176}} By this stage the writers had already talked about a chase sequence along the [[Great Wall of China|Great Wall]], as well as a fight scene amongst the [[Terracotta Army]].{{sfn|Cork|Stutz|2007|p=300}} Wilson also wrote two plot outlines about a drugs lord in the [[Golden Triangle (Southeast Asia)|Golden Triangle]] before the plans fell through out of Broccoli's concerns that the [[Government of China|Chinese government]] would [[Censorship in China|censor]] the script.{{sfn|Cork|Stutz|2007|p=300}}<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|last=Field|first=Matthew|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/930556527|title=Some kind of hero : 007 : the remarkable

country while Broccoli negotiated to film in Mexico,<ref name=documentary/> at the [[Estudios Churubusco]] in Mexico City.{{sfn|Cork|Stutz|2007|p=300}} In 1985, the Films Act was passed, removing the [[Eady Levy]], resulting in foreign artists being taxed more heavily.{{sfn|Barnes|Hearn|2001|p=176}} The associated rising costs to Eon Productions meant no part of ''Licence to Kill'' was filmed in the UK,{{sfn|Smith|2002|p=239}} the first Bond film not to do so.{{sfn|Barnes|Hearn|2001|p=176}} [[Pinewood Studios]], used in every previous ''Bond'' film, undertook only the post-production and sound re-recording.<ref name=glen/>\n\n===Writing and themes===\nThe initial outline of what would become ''Licence to Kill'' was drawn up by Wilson and Maibaum.{{sfn|Barnes|Hearn|2001|p=176}} Before the pair could develop the script, the [[Writers Guild of America]] (WGA) [[1988 Writers Guild of America strike|went on strike]] and Maibaum was unable to continue writing, leaving Wilson to work on the script on his own.{{sfn|Smith|2002|p=234}} Although both the main plot and title of ''Licence to Kill'' owe nothing to any of the Fleming novels, there are elements from the books that are used in the storyline, including a number of aspects of the short story \"[[For Your Eyes Only (short story collection)#The Hildebrand Rarity|The Hildebrand Rarity]]\", such as the character Milton Krest.<ref name=documentary/><ref name=comm/> The novel ''[[Live and Let Die (novel)|Live and Let Die]]'' provided the material surrounding Felix Leiter's mauling by a shark,{{sfn|Barnes|Hearn|2001|p=176}} whilst the [[Live and Let Die (film)|film version of the book]] provided the close similarity between the main villain, Mr. Big, and ''Licence to Kill''{{'}}s main villain Sanchez.{{sfn|Smith|2002|p=235}} The screenplay was not ready by the time casting had begun, with [[Carey Lowell]] being auditioned with lines from ''[[A View to a Kill]]''.<ref name=documentary/>\n\nThe script\u2014initially called ''Licence Revoked''\u2014was written with Dalton's characterisation of Bond in mind,{{sfn|Barnes|Hearn|2001|p=176}} and the obsession with which Bond pursues Sanchez on behalf of Leiter and his dead wife is seen as being because \"of his own brutally cut-short marriage\".{{sfn|Smith|2002|p=225}} Dalton's darker portrayal of Bond led to the violence being increased and becoming more graphic.<ref name=comm>{{cite video |year=1999 |title=[[Audio commentary]] |location=''Licence to Kill'': Ultimate Edition |medium=DVD |publisher=MGM |people=John Cork}}</ref> Wilson compared the script to [[Akira Kurosawa]]'s ''[[Yojimbo (film)|Yojimbo]]'', where a samurai \"without any attacking of the villain or its cohorts, only sowing the seeds of distrust, he manages to have the villain bring himself down\".<ref name=documentary/> Wilson freely admitted that the idea of the destruction-from-within aspect of the plot came more from ''Yojimbo'' and [[Sergio Leone]]'s remake of that film, ''[[A Fistful of Dollars]]'', than from Fleming's use of that plot device from ''[[The Man with the Golden Gun (novel)|The Man with the Golden Gun]]''.{{sfn|Smith|2002|p=235}}\n\nFor the location Wilson created the Republic of Isthmus, a [[banana republic]] based on Panama, with the pock-marked Sanchez bearing similarities to General [[Manuel Noriega]].{{sfn|Smith|2002|p=235}} The parallels between the two figures were based on Noriega's political use of drug trafficking and [[money laundering]] to provide revenues for Panama.{{sfn|Smith|2002|p=236}} Robert Davi suggested the line \"loyalty is more important than money\", which he felt was fitting to the character of Franz Sanchez, whose actions were noticed by Davi to be concerned with betrayal and retaliation.<ref name=\"glen\"/>\n\nThe United Artists press kits referred to the film's background as being \"Torn straight from the headlines of today's newspapers\"<ref>{{cite news|last=Harmetz|first=Aljean|title=Creating a Thriller, Their Words Are Their Bond|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=9 July 1989}}</ref> and the backdrop of Panama was connected to \"the [[Medell\u00edn Cartel]] in Colombia and corruption of government officials in Mexico thrown in for good measure.\"<ref>{{cite news|last=Johnston|first=Sheila|title=A cleaner, harder 007|newspaper=[[The Independent]]|date=16 June 1989}}</ref> This use of the cocaine-smuggling backdrop put ''Licence to Kill'' alongside other cinema blockbusters, such as the 1987 films ''[[Lethal Weapon]]'', ''[[Beverly Hills Cop II]]'' and ''[[RoboCop]],'' and Bond was seen to be \"poaching on their turf\" with the drug-related revenge story.{{sfn|Smith|2002|pp=236\u20137}}\n\n===Casting===\nAfter Carey Lowell was chosen to play Pam Bouvier, she watched many of the films in the series for inspiration. Lowell had described becoming a [[Bond girl]] as \"huge shoes to fill\", as she did not see herself as a \"glamour girl\", even coming to audition in jeans and a leather jacket. While Lowell wore a wig for the scenes set in the United States, a scene where Bouvier is given money and told by Bond to go and buy some new clothes (and, going off and doing so, also has her hair cut) was added so that Lowell's own short hair style could be used.<ref>{{cite video |year=1999 | title = Audio commentary|location=''Licence to Kill'': Ultimate Edition | medium = DVD | publisher = MGM | people=Carey Lowell }}</ref>\n\nRobert Davi was cast following a suggestion by Broccoli's daughter Tina,<ref name=\"documentary\"/> and screenwriter Richard Maibaum, who had seen Davi in the television film ''Terrorist on Trial: The United States vs. Salim Ajami''.{{sfn| Paul |2007|p=58}} To portray Sanchez, Davi researched the [[Illegal drug trade in Colombia|Colombian drug cartels]] and how to do a Colombian accent,<ref name=\"glen\">{{cite video |year=1999 | title = Audio commentary|location=''Licence to Kill'': Ultimate Edition | medium = DVD | publisher = MGM | people=Robert Davi }}</ref> and since he was [[method acting]], he would stay in character off-set. After Davi read ''[[Casino Royale (novel)|Casino Royale]]'' for preparation, he decided to turn Sanchez into a \"mirror image\" of James Bond, based on Ian Fleming's descriptions of [[Le Chiffre]].<ref name=\"documentary\"/> The actor also learned [[scuba diving]] for the scene where Sanchez is rescued from the sunken armoured car.<ref name=\"glen\"/>\n\nDavi later helped with the casting of Sanchez's mistress Lupe Lamora, by playing Bond in the audition.{{sfn|Cork|Stutz|2007|p=300}} [[Talisa Soto]] was picked from twelve candidates because Davi said he \"would kill for her\".<ref name=documentary/> [[David Hedison]] returned to play Felix Leiter, sixteen years after playing the character in ''[[Live and Let Die (film)|Live and Let Die]]''.
