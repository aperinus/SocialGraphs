It follows Victoria Page ([[Moira Shearer]]), a ballerina who joins the world renowned Ballet Lermontov, owned and operated by Boris Lermontov ([[Anton Walbrook]]), who tests her dedication to the ballet by making her choose between her career and her romance with composer Julian Craster ([[Marius Goring]]).\n\nIt marked the feature film debut of Shearer, an established ballerina, and also features [[Robert Helpmann]], [[L\u00e9onide Massine]], and [[Ludmilla Tch\u00e9rina]], other renowned dancers from the ballet world. The plot is based on the 1845 [[The Red Shoes (fairy tale)|eponymous fairytale]] by [[Hans Christian Andersen]], and features a ballet within it by the same title, also adapted from the Andersen work.\n\n''The Red Shoes'' was filmmaking team Powell and Pressburger's tenth collaboration and follow-up to 1947's ''[[Black Narcissus]]''. It had originally been conceived by Powell and producer [[Alexander Korda]] in the 1930s, from whom the duo purchased the rights in 1946. The majority of the cast were professional dancers. Filming of ''The Red Shoes'' took place in mid-1946, primarily in France and England.\n\nUpon release, ''The Red Shoes'' received critical acclaim, especially in the United States, where it received a total of five [[21st Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nominations, including a win for [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Best Original Score]] and [[Academy Award for Best Production Design|Best Art Direction]]. It also won the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Original Score]] and was named one of the Top 10 Films of the Year by the [[National Board of Review]]. Despite this, some dance critics gave the film unfavourable reviews as they felt its fantastical, [[impressionism|impressionistic]] centrepiece sequence depicted ballet in an unrealistic manner. The film proved a major financial success and was the first British film in history to gross over $5 million in theatrical rentals in the United States.\n\nRetrospectively, ''The Red Shoes'' is regarded as one of the best films of [[Powell and Pressburger]]'s partnership and one of the [[List of films considered the best|greatest films of all time]]. It was voted the [[BFI Top 100 British films|9th greatest British film of all time]] by the [[British Film Institute]] in 1999. The film underwent an extensive digital restoration beginning in 2006 at the [[UCLA Film and Television Archive]] to correct significant damage to the original negatives. The restored version of the film screened at the [[2009 Cannes Film Festival]] and was subsequently issued on [[Blu-ray]] by [[The Criterion Collection]]. In 2017, a poll of 150 actors, directors, writers, producers, and critics for ''[[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out]]'' magazine saw it ranked the 5th best British film ever.\n\n==Plot==\nAt a performance by the Ballet Lermontov at [[Covent Garden Opera House]], music student Julian Craster is in attendance to hear the ballet score ''Heart of Fire'', composed by his teacher, Professor Palmer. Separately present is Victoria 'Vicky' Page, a young, unknown dancer from an aristocratic background, with her aunt, Lady Neston. As ''Heart of Fire'' progresses, Julian recognises the music as one of his own compositions. During the performance, Professor Palmer receives an invitation to an after-ballet party at Lady Neston's residence, also asking Boris Lermontov, the company [[impresario]], to attend. Julian leaves the performance in disillusionment at his professor's plagiarism of his music. Lermontov and Vicky meet, and he invites her to a rehearsal of the company.\n\nJulian has written to Lermontov to explain the circumstances behind ''Heart of Fire'', but then tries to retrieve the letter. Lermontov's assistant Dimitri thwarts all attempts by Julian to gain entry to Lermontov's suite, but finally Lermontov gives Julian an audience. Julian says that he wishes to retrieve his letter before Lermontov has seen it, except that Lermontov has already read the letter. Lermontov asks Julian to play one of his own works at the piano. After hearing Julian play, Lermontov realises that Julian was the true composer of ''Heart of Fire''. Lermantov hires Julian as a [[r\u00e9p\u00e9titeur]] for the company orchestra and assistant to the company's conductor, Livingstone Montague (known colloquially to the company as 'Livy').\n\nJulian and Vicky arrive for work at the Ballet Lermontov on the same day. Later, Vicky dances with [[Ballet Rambert]] in a matinee performance of ''[[Swan Lake]]'' at the [[Mercury Theatre, Notting Hill Gate]], in a production with a company led by [[Marie Rambert]] (who appears in the film as herself in a wordless cameo). Watching this performance, Lermontov realises her potential and invites Vicky to go with Ballet Lermontov to Paris and [[Monte Carlo]]. He decides to create a starring role for her in a new ballet, ''The Ballet of the Red Shoes'', for which Julian is to provide the music. In three weeks creating the ballet together, Julian and Vicky learn to trust and respect each other as artists.\n\n''The Ballet of the Red Shoes'' is a resounding success and Lermontov revitalises the company's repertoire with Vicky in the lead roles and Julian tasked with composing new scores. In the meantime, Vicky and Julian have fallen in love, but keep their relationship secret from Lermontov. Lermontov begins to have personal feelings toward Vicky; he resents the romance between her and Julian after learning of it. The impresario fires Julian; Vicky leaves the company with him. They marry and live in London, where Julian works on composing a new opera.\n\nSome time later whilst traveling, Vicky receives a visit from Lermontov, who convinces her to return to the company to \"put on the red shoes again,\" to dance her famous role once more. On opening night, Julian appears in her dressing room; he has left the premi\u00e8re of his opera at Covent Garden to find her and take her back. Lermontov arrives; he and Julian contend for Vicky's affections, each one arguing that her true destiny is with him only. Torn between her love for Julian and her need to dance, she eventually chooses the latter.\n\nJulian, realising that he has lost her, leaves for the railway station; Lermontov consoles Vicky and tries to turn her attention to the evening's performance. Vicky is escorted to the stage wearing the red shoes and, seemingly under their influence, turns and runs from the theatre. Julian, on the platform of the railway station, runs towards her. Vicky leaps from a balcony and falls in front of an approaching train, which hits her. Whether this is suicide or murder (by the red shoes) is left ambiguous. Shortly after, a shaken Lermontov appears before the audience to announce that, \"Miss Page is unable to dance tonight\u2014nor indeed any other night\". As a mark of respect, the company performs ''The Ballet of the Red Shoes'' with a spotlight on the empty space where Vicky would have been. As Vicky bleeds to death on a stretcher, she asks Julian to remove the red shoes, just as the ballet ends.\n\n==Cast==\nIn same order as the movie's opening credits:\n{{cast list|\n* [[Anton Walbrook]] as Boris Lermontov\n* [[Marius Goring]] as Julian Craster\n* [[Moira Shearer]] as Victoria Page\n* [[Robert Helpmann]] as Ivan Boleslawsky\n* [[L\u00e9onide Massine]] as Grischa Ljubov\n* [[Albert Bassermann]] as Sergei Ratov\n* [[Ludmilla Tch\u00e9rina]] as Irina Boronskaya\n* [[Esmond Knight]] as Livingstone 'Livy' Montague\n* [[Austin Trevor]] as Professor Palmer\n* Jean Short as Terry\n* Gordon Littman as Ike\n* [[Eric Berry (actor)|Eric Berry]] as Dimitri\n* [[Irene Browne]] as Lady Neston\n* [[Jerry Verno]] as Stage Door Keeper\n* Yvonne Andre as Vicky's Dresser\n}}\n\n==Analysis==\n===\"Art versus life\"===\nA central theme to ''The Red Shoes'' is a performer's conflict between their art and personal life.{{sfn|McLean|1988|p=43}} Commenting on this theme, Powell himself stated that the film is \"about dying for art, that art is worth dying for.\"{{sfn|McLean|1988|p=43}} Film scholar Adrienne McLean, however, notes that Victoria's final leap to her death does not adequately represent this idea.{{sfn|McLean|1988|p=43}} Rather, McLean states that Victoria \"seems pushed by those she loves who would rather possess her than support her,\" and that the film ultimately illustrates the impact of \"ruthless personalities\" can have on \"the weaker or more demure.\"{{sfn|McLean|1988|p=43}}\n\nScholar Peter Fraser, in ''[[Cinema Journal]]'', observes of this tension between art and life that the film implodes its own \"narrative and lyrical worlds...&nbsp; from the moment of recognition, when Vicky looks down at her red shoes and knows that she is then her lyrical persona, her two worlds collapse.\"{{sfn|Fraser|1987|p=52}} He further states that the interpenetration of the lyrical upon the narrative \"alters the meaning of the fiction\" itself.{{sfn|Fraser|1987|p=52}} This blurring of the lyrical and the narrative is represented at the end of the film, when Vicky jumps onto the train tracks; she is wearing the red shoes which she wore while preparing in her dressing room, despite the fact that in the performance her character does not put them on until part way through the ballet. Powell and Pressburger themselves discussed this idiosyncrasy{{sfn|Powell|1986|pages=650\u2013651}} and it has been subject to significant critical analysis since.<ref name=ebert>{{cite news |title=The Red Shoes (1948) |date=1 January 2005 |url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F20050101%2FREVIEWS08%2F501010301%2F1023 |last=Ebert |first=Roger |author-link=Roger Ebert |newspaper=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]|location=Chicago|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181221061416/https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/great-movie-the-red-shoes-1948|archive-date=21 December 2018}}</ref> Powell decided that it was artistically \"right\" for Vicky to be wearing the red shoes at that point because if she is not wearing them, it takes away the ambiguity over why she died.{{sfn|Powell|1986|pages=650\u2013651}}\n\n===''The Ballet of the Red Shoes''===\n{{Quote box|align=right|width=22em|bgcolor=#ffc0cb|quote=\"We have tried to make our [ballet] sequence subjective as well as objective.

She disobeys. A crippled \"old soldier\" at the church door tells Karen they are dancing shoes. Later, she wears them to a ball, and cannot stop dancing. She dances day and night until an executioner, at her request, amputates her feet; the shoes dance away with them. She lives with a parson's family after that, and she dies with a vision of finally being able to join the Sunday congregation. In this story, the shoes represent \"her sin\", the vanity and worldly pleasures (implicitly, female sexuality) which distracted her from a life of generosity, piety, and community.\n\nThe ballet has three characters: the Girl, the Boy and the Shoemaker. The Boy, danced by [[Robert Helpmann]], is at first the girl's boyfriend; as she dances, he turns into a sketch on transparent cellophane. Later he appears as the living counterpart of the Press, with \"Le Jour\" written on his forehead (\"The Daily\") and an alter ego made of folded newspapers, then as the prince in a triumphant [[Pas de deux]]/six. Finally, the Boy appears as the village parson; when he unties the red shoes, the girl dies in his arms. The Shoemaker, danced by [[L\u00e9onide Massine]], is a diabolical figure far beyond the scope of the \"old soldier\". Always dancing, he tempts the girl with the shoes, installs them by \"movie magic\" on her feet, partners her briefly, and generally gloats over her confusion and despair. At one point he leads a mob of \"primitive\" monsters who surround her, but they elevate her high in a triumphant ballerina pose. At the end, the shoemaker picks up the discarded shoes and offers them to the audience. In the context of the movie, the shoes represent the choice offered by Lermontov to become a great dancer, at the expense of normal human relationships.\n\n===Casting===\n[[File:Moira Shearer 1951 press photo.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Moira Shearer, a trained ballerina, was cast in the lead role]]\nPowell and Pressburger decided early on that they had to use dancers who could act rather than actors who could dance.{{sfn|Connelly|2005|pages=36\u201340}} To create a realistic feeling of a [[ballet company]] at work, and to be able to include a fifteen-minute ballet as the high point of the film, they created their own ballet company using many dancers from [[The Royal Ballet]].{{sfn|McLean|2008|pages=33\u201334}}\n\nIn casting the lead role of Victoria Page, Powell and Pressburger sought an experienced dancer who could also act.{{sfn|Connelly|2005|p=36}} Scottish ballerina Moira Shearer was recommended by [[Robert Helpmann]], who had been cast in the film as Ivan Boleslawsky, and was also appointed the [[choreography|choreographer]] of the central ballet sequence; Helpmann had worked with Shearer prior in a production of his ballet ''[[Miracle in the Gorbals]]''.{{sfn|Connelly|2005|p=36}} At the time, Shearer was beginning to ascend in her career with the Sadler's Wells Dance Company, dancing under [[Ninette de Valois]].{{sfn|Street|2016|p=109}} Upon reading the screenplay, Shearer declined the offer, as she felt taking a film role would negatively impact her dancing career.{{sfn|Connelly|2005|p=36}} She also felt that the screenplay presented a ballet company that was unrealistic, \"utterly unlike any ballet company that there had ever been anywhere.\"{{sfn|Connelly|2005|p=36}} She recalled: \"''Red Shoes'' was the last thing I wanted to do. I fought for a year to get away from that film, and I couldn't shake the director off.\"{{sfn|McLean|1988|p=36}}\n\nAfter Shearer's refusal of the role, American ballerinas Nana Gollner and Edwina Seaver tested for the part, but their acting abilities proved unsatisfactory to Powell and Pressburger.{{sfn|Connelly|2005|p=36}} Non-dancers [[Hazel Court]] and [[Ann Todd]] were briefly considered before Shearer changed her mind, and decided to accept the role with de Valois's blessing.{{sfn|Connelly|2005|pages=36\u201337}} Shearer claimed that de Valois, exasperated by the ordeal, finally advised her to take the role.{{sfn|McLean|1988|p=36}} Powell alternately recounted that de Valois was \"more manipulative\" in the process, and would vacillate in regard to whether or not Shearer would have a place in the company to return to once filming was completed, accounting for Shearer's alleged protracted contemplation of whether to take the part.{{sfn|McLean|1988|p=36}}\n\nFor the role of Julian Craster, the musician with whom Victoria falls in love, Marius Goring was cast.{{sfn|Connelly|2005|p=38}} While Goring\u2014at the time in his mid-30s\u2014was slightly too old to play the role, Powell and Pressburger were impressed by his \"tact and unselfish approach to his craft.\"{{sfn|Connelly|2005|p=38}} They cast Anton Walbrook in the part of Victoria's domineering ballet director, Boris Lermontov, for similar reasons, as they felt he was a \"well-mannered and sensitive actor\" who could support Shearer through their emotional scenes together.{{sfn|Connelly|2005|p=38}}\n\nThe other principal dancers cast in the film included [[L\u00e9onide Massine]] (who also served as a choreographer for his role as the shoemaker in ''The Ballet of the Red Shoes''), portraying dancer Grischa Ljubov,{{sfn|Connelly|2005|pages=39\u201340, 69}} and [[Ludmilla Tch\u00e9rina]] as dancer Irina Boronskaya;

The music was subsequently used in ''[[The Line, the Cross and the Curve]]'' (1993) a film referencing ''The Red Shoes'' written and directed by Bush.
