It is produced by [[Jason Blum]], [[Oren Peli]], and [[James Wan]]. It is the fourth installment in the [[Insidious (film series)|''Insidious'' franchise]], and the second in the chronology of the story running through the series. Starring [[Lin Shaye]], [[Angus Sampson]], [[Leigh Whannell]], [[Spencer Locke]], [[Caitlin Gerard]], and [[Bruce Davison]], the film follows [[parapsychology|parapsychologist]] Elise Rainier as she investigates a haunting in her childhood home.\n\nTalks for a fourth installment in the franchise began in June 2015, with Whannell saying the next film would take place shortly before [[Insidious (film)|the first film]]. In May 2016, it was announced that ''Chapter 4'' would have an October 2017 release date with Whannell writing, Blum, Peli and Wan producing, Robitel directing, and Shaye returning to reprise her role as Elise Rainier. [[Principal photography]] began in August 2016, and ended the following month.\n\nThe film was released in the United States on January 5, 2018 by [[Universal Pictures]]. It grossed $167 million worldwide, the highest of the franchise, and received mixed reviews, with praise for Shaye's performance but some critics stating that the franchise had run its course.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://editorial.rottentomatoes.com/article/insidious-the-last-key-unlocks-few-scares/|title=Insidious: The Last Key Unlocks Few Scares|work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|date=January 4, 2018|access-date=January 5, 2018}}</ref> ''[[Insidious: Fear the Dark]]'' is scheduled to be released in 2023, to continue the storyline of the first two films.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1953, Elise Rainier lives in Five Keys, [[New Mexico]] with her parents Audrey and Gerald and younger brother Christian. Elise and Christian encounter a ghost in their bedroom. Frightened, Christian looks for a whistle their mother gave him to call for help, but cannot find it. Gerald, furious, canes Elise and locks her in the basement. Elise opens a mysterious red doorway and is briefly possessed by a [[demon|demonic spirit]]. Audrey is killed by the demon.\n\nDecades later in California in 2010, Elise works as a paranormal investigator with her colleagues Specs and Tucker. A man named Ted Garza calls, saying he's been experiencing paranormal activity at his house. Realizing it's her childhood home, Elise departs to help him. While investigating, she finds Christian's lost whistle, but it disappears again after she encounters a female spirit. Elise tells Specs and Tucker that she had seen the spirit before when she was a young girl. She had fled the house in fear of another beating from her father, abandoning Christian.\n\nElise, Tucker, and Specs meet Melissa and Imogen, Christian's daughters. Christian is still furious at Elise for abandoning him. Hoping to repair their relationship, Elise hands Melissa a photo of the whistle, telling her to show it to Christian. Elise and Tucker discover a [[secret passage|hidden room in the basement]]. Guided by the female spirit, they discover a young woman being held prisoner inside. Ted reveals that he is responsible. He locks the group in and tries to kill Specs. Specs kills Ted in self defense.\n\nAfter police clear the house, Christian and his daughters go inside to find the whistle. Melissa is attacked by the demon from Elise's past, known as \"Key Face.\" Key Face sends her into a coma, with her [[astral projection|consciousness]] now stuck in the spirit realm of \"The Further.\"\n\nTrying to save Melissa, Elise searches the house and discovers hidden suitcases containing belongings of numerous other women who had been held prisoner, including the young woman she had seen as a girl. Elise realizes that like Ted, her father Gerald had also kidnapped women and held them in the secret room. The woman she saw as a girl, Anna, was actually alive then, not a ghost; she was later killed by Gerald. In the present, Elise is ambushed by Key Face and her spirit taken into the Further.\n\nImogen, who possesses abilities like Elise's, enters The Further and is led by Anna's ghost into a prison realm where Key Face is holding all of the souls he has taken, including Melissa and Elise. Elise realizes Key Face had been controlling both Gerald and Ted, and feeds on the fear and hatred generated by the women they kidnapped. Key Face tries to coerce Elise into hurting her father's spirit as revenge for what he's done. Elise starts beating Gerald, but is stopped by Imogen and refuses to feed Key Face any more hatred. Key Face attacks Elise, but Gerald saves her before he is stabbed by Key Face, his spirit vanishing.\n\nKey Face stabs Melissa, causing her physical body to start dying. He attempts to possess Elise. Elise blows Christian's whistle, and Audrey's spirit arrives, vanquishing Key Face. They open a door and see a young boy, Dalton Lambert. Realizing they opened the wrong door, they leave the door open and find Melissa. Melissa's spirit returns to her body in the real world, saving her life. Elise makes amends with her mother's spirit and she and Imogen return to the real world and reunite with Christian. Christian forgives Elise.\n\nIn her sleep, Elise has a dream about Dalton and a red-faced demon. She awakens and receives a call from Lorraine. Elise had [[Insidious: Chapter 2|helped her son years earlier]], and now [[Insidious (film)|her grandson Dalton needs the same help, which Elise agrees to provide]].\n\n== Cast ==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Lin Shaye]] as Elise Rainier\n** [[Ava Kolker (actress)|Ava Kolker]] as Little Elise Rainier\n** [[Hana Hayes]] as Young Elise Rainier\n* [[Angus Sampson]] as Tucker\n* [[Leigh Whannell]] as Specs\n* [[Spencer Locke]] as Melissa Rainier, Elise's niece and Christian's youngest daughter.\n* [[Caitlin Gerard]] as Imogen Rainier, Elise's niece and Christian's eldest daughter.

I haven't really thought about it yet. But for the purposes of this interview, I'll say that I'd like to explore the time between this film and the first film.
