Set in [[Tuscany]], the film focuses on a British writer ([[William Shimell]]) and a French antiques dealer ([[Juliette Binoche]]), whose relationship undergoes an odd transformation over the course of a day. The film was a French-majority production, with co-producers in Italy and Belgium. The dialogue is in English, French and Italian.<ref>{{cite web|last=Cheshire|first=Godfrey|date=23 May 2012|url=https://www.criterion.com/current/posts/2303-certified-copy-at-home-and-abroad|title=Certified Copy: At Home and Abroad|work=Criterion Collection|access-date=4 June 2013}}</ref>\n\n''Certified Copy'' premiered at the [[2010 Cannes Film Festival]], where Binoche won the [[Best Actress Award (Cannes Film Festival)|Best Actress Award]] for her performance. Critically acclaimed, the film is considered to be among the best of the year and the decade.\n\n==Plot==\nBritish writer James Miller (Shimell) is in Tuscany to give a talk to a group about his new book, titled ''Certified Copy'', which argues that, in art, issues of authenticity are irrelevant because every reproduction is itself an original, and even the original is a copy of another form. A French antiques dealer, whose name is never given (Binoche), attends the event with her 11-year-old son in order to have Miller sign several copies of the book she has purchased, but has to leave early because her son is hungry and becomes a distraction. She leaves her phone number with Miller's translator.\n\nHer relationship with her son is strained; he teases her about giving her phone number to Miller's translator and suggests she is romantically interested in Miller, which she denies.\n\nMiller and the woman later meet at her shop. Though she had intended for them to browse antiques together, he brusquely rebuffs this idea and suggests instead that they go for a drive, as long as they're back for his 9 p.m. train. On their aimless trip, Miller signs six copies of his book for the woman \u2014 including a copy for her sister, Marie, in which he inscribes a note that the woman dislikes. The two debate the premise of his book, including the relationship between authenticity and simplicity. During the conversation, which at times becomes very strained, Miller points out that even the ''[[Mona Lisa]]'' is a 'copy' of the woman who modeled for the painting, real or imagined.\n\nThe woman takes Miller to an art museum to see another famous 'copy,' but he is uninterested, saying that he has already finished work on the book and is not interested in further examples. The woman becomes increasingly distraught as she complains about her rebellious son to Miller, but he attempts to rationalize her son's behavior, frustrating the woman.\n\nAt his insistence, they visit a nearby caf\u00e9 for coffee. When Miller steps out to take a phone call, the caf\u00e9 owner begins speaking to the woman, mistaking Miller for her husband. Binoche's character plays along as the caf\u00e9 owner espouses the importance of marriage, no matter the flaws of one's partner. Miller returns and the woman tells him about the caf\u00e9 woman's assumption about their relationship.\n\nOnce they leave the caf\u00e9, the nature of their discussion changes, and they begin to speak in a combination of French and English instead of just English (Miller states that he only learned French, not Italian, in school). They also begin to behave as though they are a married couple, referring to the woman's son as \"our\" son. She expresses unhappiness over their 15th wedding anniversary the previous night, during which he fell asleep while she was getting ready in the bathroom, and tells him his constant traveling for work has made him emotionally distant.\n\nDuring their walk through the city, they encounter an older couple and discuss their interpretations of a nearby statue. The older man pulls Miller aside and offers unsolicited \"fatherly\" advice: that a small gesture of affection could mend the rift between Miller and his wife. As Miller and his wife walk away, he places his hand on her shoulder; when they go into a restaurant, she goes to the bathroom and applies lipstick and puts on earrings.\n\nWhen she returns to the table, Miller is angry; he has clashed with the waiter over the quality of the wine. They begin to fight and Miller leaves the restaurant, though he waits for her outside. They pass by a church; she goes in without him, though she later insists this was only to take off her bra. They are entranced by and follow two elderly churchgoers, whose home turns out to be beside the hotel where Miller and his wife spent their honeymoon, though Miller does not remember the specifics of the hotel.\n\nThe woman goes inside and asks to tour the room; she and Miller reminisce about their wedding night, although Miller does not remember many details. The woman appeals to Miller, saying that they should be more accepting of each other's faults, because the alternative is loneliness. He appears to rebuff her, saying he still has to catch his 9 p.m. train. Miller then goes into the bathroom and looks into the mirror; when nearby church bells begin to toll 8 p.m., he leaves the bathroom.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Juliette Binoche]] as She\n* [[William Shimell]] as James Miller\n* [[Jean-Claude Carri\u00e8re]] as The Man at the Square\n* Agathe Natanson as The Woman at the Square\n* Gianna Giachetti as The Caf\u00e9 Owner\n* Adrian Moore as The Son\n* Angelo Barbagallo as The Translator\n* Andrea Laurenzi as The Guide\n* Filippo Troiano as The Groom\n* Manuela Balsimelli as The Bride\n\n==Production==\nAbbas Kiarostami and Juliette Binoche first met and became friends in the mid-1990s. Since then they had both desired to work together and in 2008 Binoche appeared briefly in Kiarostami's experimental film ''[[Shirin (film)|Shirin]]''. During a visit in [[Tehran]] by Binoche, Kiarostami told Binoche the synopsis of ''Certified Copy'' as a casual anecdote, which she said that she fully believed until he confessed to having made it up.<ref name=europe1>{{cite web|last=Attali|first=Danielle|date=16 May 2010|url=http://festival-cannes.europe1.fr/festival-de-cannes/2010/Actu/Vertigineuse-Juliette-Binoche-186627/|title=Vertigineuse Juliette Binoche|language=fr|work=europe1.fr|publisher=[[Europe 1]]|access-date=17 May 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100519053136/http://festival-cannes.europe1.fr/festival-de-cannes/2010/Actu/Vertigineuse-Juliette-Binoche-186627/|archive-date=19 May 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref> According to Kiarostami, studying the reactions of Binoche as she listened to the story was a vital part of the film's further development. \"The film started to build according to the story that I was telling, but also according to my knowledge of her as a woman with her vulnerability, with her sensitivity, with what I knew about her soul, about her relationship with her children.\"<ref name=varietyqa>{{cite web|last=Vivarelli|first=Nick|date=18 May 2010|url=https://www.variety.com/index.asp?layout=festivals&jump=story&id=3628&articleid=VR1118019551|title=Q&A: 'Certified' director Abbas Kiarostami|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|access-date=20 May 2010}}</ref>\n\nThe film suffered from several delays and changes in the cast.
