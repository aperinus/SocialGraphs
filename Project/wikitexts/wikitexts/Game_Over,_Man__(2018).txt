It follows three down-on-their-luck housekeepers who must save the day when the [[Los Angeles]] hotel where they work is taken hostage. The film was released on March 23, 2018 on [[Netflix]], but was panned by critics.\n\n==Plot==\nThree friends, the Dewd Crew, work as housekeepers at a luxury hotel in Los Angeles and are about to pitch their power suit to get it financed by their potential benefactor Awadi, the Bey of Tunisia.\n\nThey pitch their proposal at the bey's party, but the hotel manager confiscates the check the bey gives them and fires them. Moments later Awadi is taken hostage by terrorists in a ''[[Die Hard]]''-type scenario. \n\nThe inexperienced trio narrowly escapes and, realising it's needed, rise to the occasion. Alexxx, Darren and Joel outwit two of the terrorists somewhat by accident. Meanwhile the Bey is being forced to access information for an offshore account which the terrorists' hacker is trying to drain. The trio somehow crash through the window where the hacking is in progress, thwarting it. \n\nHowever, Mr. Ahmad, Bey Awadi's personal attach\u00e8, is shown to be the real mastermind behind the terrorists, discovered when Alexxx calls him with the hacker's phone. On television he demands 500 million or he will kill one hostage every 15 minutes. \n\nThe trio plan to overcome the terrorists by pumping Salvia into the conference room where everyone is. But, as they are fighting amongst themselves, they aren't able to follow through. \n\nOne of the terrorists, whose life partner the trio accidentally killed, takes them to the hotel's spa to torture them. They trick and kill him, then rig him with a version of their invention, a remote controlled power suit. Sending him into the conference room as a distraction, they themselves enter with automatic weapons blazing.\n\nMr. Ahmad soon takes control back, heading to the helicopter on the roof. The trio follows with what seems to be the ransom money. They convince him to take the money but leave Bey, as the copter heads off it explodes as they rigged one of the bags with the exploding collars. \n\nThe trio saves the lives of the remaining hostages in the building, one of which gets them rich developing a video game based on them.\n\n==Cast==\n\n* [[Adam DeVine]] as Alexxx\n* [[Anders Holm]] as Darren\n* [[Blake Anderson]] as Joel\n* [[Utkarsh Ambudkar]] as Bae Awadi\n* [[Aya Cash]] as Cassie\n* [[Neal McDonough]] as Conrad\n* [[Daniel Stern (actor)|Daniel Stern]] as Mitch\n* [[Jamie Demetriou]] as Mr. Ahmad\n* [[Rhona Mitra]] as Erma\n* [[Sam Richardson (actor)|Sam Richardson]] as Donald\n* [[Steve Howey (actor)|Steve Howey]] as Rich\n* [[Mac Brandt]] as Jared\n* [[Geno Segers]] as Sal\n* [[William B.
