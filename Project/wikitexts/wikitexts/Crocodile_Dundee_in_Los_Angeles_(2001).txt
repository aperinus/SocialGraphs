It is the [[sequel]] to ''[[Crocodile Dundee II]]'' (1988) and the third and final film of the [[Crocodile Dundee (film series)|''Crocodile Dundee'' film series]]. Hogan and [[Linda Kozlowski]] reprise their roles as [[Michael \"Crocodile\" Dundee]] and Sue Charlton, respectively. The film was shot on location in [[Los Angeles]] and in [[Queensland]]. Actor Paul Hogan reported that the inspiration for the storyline came during a tour of [[Litomy\u0161l]], Czech Republic in 1993. It was released on April 18, 2001 in the United States. It grossed $39.4 million worldwide and received negative reviews from critics who called it an unnecessary sequel.\n\n==Plot==\n[[Michael \"Crocodile\" Dundee]] is living in the Australian outback with Sue Charlton and their young son Mikey. [[Crocodile]] hunting has been made illegal, and Mick is reduced to wrestling crocodiles for the entertainment of tourists. He has a rival in the business, another outback survivalist named Jacko. When an opportunity arises for Sue to become the Los Angeles bureau chief of a newspaper owned by her father, Mick and his family cross the Pacific to [[California]].\n\nIn the United States, both Mick and his son have encounters with the locals, causing cross-cultural mishaps. Mick becomes an undercover amateur [[Detective|sleuth]], helping to probe the mysterious death of his wife's predecessor at the newspaper, while Mikey attends a local school, where he quickly impresses his classmates and teacher with his outback survival skills. Because the case takes up so much of their time, Mick and Sue eventually call in Jacko to babysit their son; immediately, Jacko and Mikey's teacher become interested in each other.\n\nIt is revealed that the dead reporter had been investigating a film studio, which is about to make a sequel to the [[action film]] ''Lethal Agent'', despite the title's [[Box office bomb|commercial failure]]. Mick becomes suspicious when several paintings from Southern Europe are brought onto the set; although at first he suspects drug smuggling, the pictures themselves are revealed to be missing art from a museum in former [[Yugoslavia]], thought lost in the [[Yugoslav Wars|recent civil wars]]. They are to appear in the film as mere props, to be publicly 'destroyed' in a scene in which they are set on fire, at which point they will have been exchanged for copies.\n\nAttempting to secure one of the paintings as evidence, Mick, Sue, and Jacko run afoul of the studio director and his [[criminal|thugs]]. Using the studio's props and three lions used in filming to defeat the gangsters, Mick and Sue solve the case and return to Australia, where they are officially married.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Paul Hogan]] as [[Michael \"Crocodile\" Dundee|Michael J. \"Crocodile\" Dundee]]\n* [[Linda Kozlowski]] as Sue Charlton\n* [[Jere Burns]] as Arnan Rothman\n* [[Jonathan Banks]] as Milo\u0161 Drubnik\n* Alec Wilson as Jacko\n* [[Gerry Skilton]] as Nugget O'Cass\n* [[Steve Rackman]] as Donk\n* Serge Cockburn as Michael \"Mikey\" Dundee II / Michael Charlton\n* [[Aida Turturro]] as Jean Ferraro\n* [[Paul Rodriguez (actor)|Paul Rodriguez]] as Diego\n* [[Kaitlin Hopkins]] as Miss Mathis\n* [[Mike Tyson]] as Himself\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Box office===\nThe film grossed $7,759,103 at the box office in Australia.<ref>[http://film.vic.gov.au/resources/documents/AA4_Aust_Box_office_report.pdf ''Film Victoria - Australian Films at the Australian Box Office''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723234802/http://film.vic.gov.au/resources/documents/AA4_Aust_Box_office_report.pdf |date=23 July 2011 }}</ref> The film debuted in 4th place at the US box office behind ''[[Bridget Jones's Diary (film)|Bridget Jones's Diary]]'' (which was #1 in its second weekend), ''[[Spy Kids (film)|Spy Kids]]'' and ''[[Along Came a Spider (film)|Along Came a Spider]]''.<ref>{{cite news|title= Bridget Carries a Slow Weekend|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|url= http://articles.latimes.com/2001/apr/24/entertainment/ca-54835|accessdate=25 December 2010}}</ref> It grossed  $39 million worldwide, below the total gross of the previous two films.
