It is directed by [[Bernardo Bertolucci]] from a screenplay he co-wrote with [[Mark Peploe]], which was adapted from Puyi's [[From Emperor to Citizen|1964 autobiography]], and independently produced by [[Jeremy Thomas]].<ref>''[[Variety Film Reviews|Variety]]'' film review; 7 October 1987.</ref>\n\nThe film depicts Puyi's life from his ascent to the throne as a small boy to his imprisonment and \u201c[[political rehabilitation]]\u201d by the [[Chinese Communist Party]].  It stars [[John Lone]] in the eponymous role, with [[Peter O'Toole]], [[Joan Chen]], [[Ruocheng Ying]], [[Victor Wong (actor born 1927)|Victor Wong]], [[Dennis Dun]], [[Vivian Wu]], [[Lisa Lu]], and [[Ryuichi Sakamoto]]; who also composed the film score with [[David Byrne]] and [[Cong Su]]. It was the first Western feature film authorized by the People's Republic of China to film in the [[Forbidden City]] in Beijing.<ref name=\"timemag\">[https://archive.today/20130105160122/http://www.time.com/time/printout/0,8816,967235,00.html Love And Respect, Hollywood-Style], an April 1988 article by [[Richard Corliss]] in ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]''</ref>\n\n''The Last Emperor'' premiered at the 1987 [[Tokyo International Film Festival]], and was released in the United States by [[Columbia Pictures]] on November 18. It earned widespread positive reviews from critics and was also a commercial success. At the [[60th Academy Awards]], it won nine [[Academy Award|Oscar]]s, including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]], and [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Adapted Screenplay]]. It also won several other accolades, including three [[BAFTA Awards]], four [[Golden Globe Awards]], nine [[David di Donatello|David di Donatello Awards]], and a [[Grammy Awards|Grammy Award]] for its musical score. The film was converted into [[3D film|3D]] and shown in the Cannes Classics section at the [[2013 Cannes Film Festival]].<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n==Plot==\nBy 1950, the 44-year old Puyi, former Emperor of China, has been in custody for five years since his capture by the [[Red Army]] during the [[Soviet invasion of Manchuria]]. In the recently established [[People's Republic of China]], Puyi arrives as a [[political prisoner]] and [[war criminal]] at the [[Fushun War Criminals Management Centre|Fushun Prison]]. Soon after his arrival, Puyi attempts suicide, but is quickly rescued and told he must stand trial.\n\n42 years earlier, in 1908, a toddler Puyi is summoned to the [[Forbidden City]] by the dying [[Empress Dowager Cixi]]. After telling him that the [[Guangxu Emperor|previous emperor]] had died earlier that day, Cixi tells Puyi that he is to be the next emperor. After his coronation, Puyi, frightened by his new surroundings, repeatedly expresses his wish to go home, but is denied. Despite having scores of palace [[eunuch]]s and maids to wait on him, his only real friend is his [[wet nurse]], [[Wang Lianshou|Ar Mo]].\n\nAs he grows up, his upbringing is confined entirely to the imperial palace and he is prohibited from leaving. One day, he is visited by his younger brother, [[Pujie]], who tells him he is no longer Emperor and that China has become a [[Republic of China (1912\u20131949)|republic]]; that same day, Ar Mo is forced to leave. In 1919, the kindly [[Reginald Johnston]] is appointed as Puyi's tutor and gives him a [[Western education|Western-style education]], and Puyi becomes increasingly desirous to leave the Forbidden City. Johnston, wary of the [[courtier]]s' expensive lifestyle, convinces Puyi that the best way of achieving this is through marriage; Puyi subsequently weds [[Wanrong]], with [[Wenxiu]] as a secondary consort.\n\nPuyi then sets about reforming the Forbidden City, including expelling the thieving palace eunuchs. However, in 1924, he himself is expelled from the palace and exiled to [[Tianjin|Tientsin]] following the [[Beijing Coup]]. He leads a decadent life as a [[Playboy lifestyle|playboy]] and [[Anglophile]], and sides with [[Empire of Japan|Japan]] after the [[Mukden Incident]]. During this time, Wenxiu divorces him, but Wanrong remains and eventually succumbs to [[opium addiction]]. In 1934, the Japanese crown him \"Emperor\" of their [[puppet state]] of [[Manchukuo]], though his supposed political supremacy is undermined at every turn. Wanrong gives birth to a child, but the baby is [[Neonaticide|murdered at birth]] by the Japanese and proclaimed [[stillborn]]. He remains the nominal ruler of the region until his capture by the Red Army.\n\nUnder the Communist re-education program for political prisoners, Puyi is coerced by his interrogators to formally renounce his forced [[Collaboration with the Axis Powers|collaboration]] with the Japanese invaders during the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]]. After heated discussions with Jin Yuan, the warden of the Fushun Prison, and watching a film detailing the [[Japanese war crimes|wartime atrocities committed by the Japanese]], Puyi eventually recants and is considered rehabilitated by the government; he is subsequently released in 1959.\n\nSeveral years later in 1967, Puyi has become a simple gardener who lives a peasant [[proletarian]] existence following the rise of [[Mao Zedong's cult of personality]] and the [[Cultural Revolution]]. On his way home from work, he happens upon a [[Red Guards (China)|Red Guard]] parade, celebrating the rejection of [[Concentration of land ownership|landlordism]] by the communists. He sees Jin Yuan, now one of the political prisoners punished as an anti-revolutionary in the parade, forced to wear a [[dunce cap]] and a [[sandwich board]] bearing punitive slogans.\n\nPuyi later visits the Forbidden City where he meets an assertive young boy wearing the red scarf of the [[Young Pioneers of China|Pioneer Movement]]. The boy orders Puyi to step away from the throne, but Puyi proves that he was indeed the [[Son of Heaven]] before approaching the throne. Behind it, Puyi finds a 60-year-old pet [[Cricket (insect)|cricket]] that he was given by palace official [[Chen Baochen]] on his coronation day and gives it to the child. Amazed by the gift, the boy turns to talk to Puyi, but finds that he has disappeared.\n\nIn 1987, a tour guide leads a group through the palace. Stopping in front of the throne, the guide sums up Puyi's life in a few, brief sentences, before concluding that he died in 1967.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[John Lone]] as [[Puyi]] (adult)\n** Richard Vuu as Puyi (3 years old)\n** Tijger Tsou as Puyi (8 years old)<ref name=\"THE LAST EMPEROR 15\" />\n** Wu Tao as Puyi (15 years old)\n* [[Joan Chen]] as [[Empress Wanrong|Wanrong]]\n* [[Peter O'Toole]] as [[Reginald Johnston]]\n* [[Ying Ruocheng]] as the Detention Camp Governor \n* [[Victor Wong (actor born 1927)|Victor Wong]] as [[Chen Baochen]]\n* [[Dennis Dun]] as Big Li\n* [[Ryuichi Sakamoto]] as [[Masahiko Amakasu]]\n* [[Maggie Han]] as Eastern Jewel ([[Yoshiko Kawashima]])\n* [[Ric Young]] as the Camp Interrogator\n* [[Vivian Wu]] as [[Wenxiu]]\n* [[Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa]] as Chang\n* Jade Go as [[Wang Lianshou|Ar Mo]]\n* Fumihiko Ikeda as Colonel Yoshioka\n* Fan Guang as [[Pujie]] (adult), Puyi's younger brother\n** Henry Kyi as Pujie (7 years old)\n** Alvin Riley III as Pujie (14 years old)\n* [[Lisa Lu]] as [[Empress Dowager Cixi]]\n* [[Basil Pao]] as [[Zaifeng, Prince Chun|Prince Chun]], Puyi's father.\n* Dong Liang as [[Youlan (G\u016bwalgiya)|Lady Consort Chun]], Puyi's mother.\n* [[Henry O]] as the [[Chamberlain (office)|Lord Chamberlain]]\n}}\n\nOther cast members include [[Chen Kaige]] as the Captain of the [[Imperial Guards (Qing China)|Imperial Guard]], [[Hideo Takamatsu]] as General [[Takashi Hishikari]], Hajime Tachibana as the General's translator, Zhang Liangbin as the [[eunuch]] Big Foot, Huang Wenjie as the eunuch Hunchback, Chen Shu as [[Zhang Jinghui]], Cheng Shuyan as [[Hiro Saga]], Li Fusheng as [[Xie Jieshi]], and [[Constantine Gregory]] as the Emperor's [[oculist]].\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\n[[Bernardo Bertolucci]] proposed the film to the [[Government of China|Chinese government]] as one of two possible projects \u2013 the other was an adaptation of ''[[Man's Fate|La Condition humaine]]'' (''Man's Fate'') by [[Andr\u00e9 Malraux]].

It probably is unforgivably [[bourgeois]] to admire a film because of its locations, but in the case of ''The Last Emperor'' the narrative cannot be separated from the awesome presence of the Forbidden City, and from Bertolucci's astonishing use of locations, authentic costumes, and thousands of extras to create the everyday reality of this strange little boy.\"<ref>{{cite news |last1=Ebert |first1=Roger |title=The Last Emperor Movie Review (1987) |url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/the-last-emperor-1987 |access-date=2018-09-22 |work=[[The Chicago Sun-Times]] |date=1987-12-09 }}</ref></blockquote>\n\n[[Jonathan Rosenbaum]] compared ''The Last Emperor'' favorably to [[Steven Spielberg]]'s ''[[Empire of the Sun (film)|Empire of the Sun]]'': <blockquote>\"At best, apart from a few snapshots, ''Empire of the Sun'' teaches us something about the inside of one director's brain.

The company quickly restored the scene, blaming \"confusion and misunderstanding\" for the edit while opining that the Rape sequence was \"too sensational\" for Japanese audiences.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Chang|first1=Iris|url=http://www.irischang.net/books/index.html|title=The Rape of Nanking (book)|date=1997|publisher=Basic Books|isbn=0-465-06835-9|page=210}}</ref>\n===Home media===\nHemdale licensed its video rights to [[Nelson Entertainment]], which released the film on [[VHS]] and [[Laserdisc]].<ref name=\":0\" /> The film also received a Laserdisc release in [[Australia]] in 1992, through Columbia Tri-Star Video.
