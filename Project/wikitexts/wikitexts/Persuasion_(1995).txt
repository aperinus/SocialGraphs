In her theatrical film debut, [[Amanda Root]] stars as protagonist [[Anne Elliot]], while [[Ciar\u00e1n Hinds]] plays her romantic interest, Captain [[Frederick Wentworth (Persuasion)|Frederick Wentworth]]. The film is set in 19th-century England, eight years after Anne was persuaded by others to reject Wentworth's proposal of marriage. ''Persuasion'' follows the two as they become reacquainted with each other while supporting characters threaten to interfere.\n\nThe novel was adapted by [[Nick Dear]], who considered the story more mature than Austen's other novels, characterising it as one of realism and truthfulness, particularly in telling the story of two people separated and then reunited. As Austen's style conveys Anne's thoughts internally, Dear and Root felt compelled to express the character's emotions using less dialogue. Michell avoided what he felt was the polished, artificial feel of other 19th-century depictions, and discouraged his actors from wearing make-up or appearing too hygienic. Costume designer [[Alexandra Byrne]] produced clothing that appeared \"lived-in\", which won her a [[British Academy Television Craft Awards|BAFTA]]. ''Persuasion'' was shot in chronological order, allowing Root to portray more easily Anne's development from being downtrodden to happy and blossoming. It was filmed during a period of popularity for Austen's works.\n\nOriginally the [[BBC]] was the sole production company of ''Persuasion'' until it partnered with the American [[WGBH-TV|WGBH Boston]] and the French Millesime. This gave the production a larger budget and allowed it to be filmed at locations featured in the novel, including [[Lyme Regis]] and [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]]. ''Persuasion'' originally aired on 16 April 1995, when it was broadcast on [[BBC Two]]. [[Sony Pictures Classics]] released the film in American cinemas on 27 September 1995, as Austen's increasing popularity became apparent to Hollywood. ''Persuasion''{{'}}s cinematic release attracted the attention of film critics, and it received generally positive reviews, with many praising Root's performance. Film scholars have observed significant changes from the source material, as well as class and gender themes.\n\n== Plot ==\nThe film opens by [[cross-cutting]] between scenes of a naval ship carrying Admiral Croft, and a carriage carrying Mr. Shepherd and his widowed daughter Mrs. Clay to Kellynch Hall. Shepherd and Clay are accosted by creditors due to the debts owed by the residence's owner, Sir Walter Elliot, while Croft discusses the end of the [[Napoleonic Wars]] with fellow men of the navy. Sir Walter, a vain foppish [[baronet]], is faced with financial ruin. Though Sir Walter initially opposes the idea, he eventually agrees temporarily to move to [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]] while the Hall is let; the idea came from Shepherd, family friend Lady Russell, and Sir Walter's second daughter, the intelligent [[Anne Elliot]].\n\nAnne is visibly shaken upon learning that the new tenant of Kellynch Hall will be Admiral Croft, who is the brother-in-law of [[Frederick Wentworth (Persuasion)|Frederick Wentworth]]\u2014a naval captain she was persuaded to reject in marriage eight years previously because of his lack of prospects and connections. Wentworth is now wealthy from serving in the Napoleonic Wars and has returned to England, presumably to find a wife. Later, Anne expresses to Lady Russell her unhappiness at her family's current financial predicament, and at her past decision to reject the captain's proposal of marriage. Anne visits her younger sister Mary, a [[hypochondriac]] who has married into a local farming family, the Musgroves. Anne patiently listens to the various complaints confided in her by each of the Musgrove family; this includes Mary's husband Charles\u2014who once proposed to Anne\u2014sisters-in-law Louisa and Henrietta, and parents-in-law Mr. and Mrs. Musgrove.\n\nCaptain Wentworth comes to dine with the Musgroves, but Anne avoids going, volunteering to nurse Mary's injured son. The following morning at breakfast, Anne and Mary are met briefly by Wentworth, the first time he and Anne have seen each other since she rejected him. Anne later hears that Wentworth thought her so altered that he \"would not have known [her] again\".<ref name=Dearinterview /> Louisa and Henrietta begin to pursue marriage with Wentworth, as the family is unaware of his and Anne's past relationship. Privately hurt by Anne's refusal years before, Wentworth appears to court Louisa, much to Anne's chagrin. Wentworth is told by Louisa that Anne had refused Charles' offer of marriage - a refusal which the Musgroves believed to be at the instigation of Lady Russell. After that, Charles had instead proposed to Mary.\n\nAnne, Wentworth, and the younger Musgroves go to [[Lyme Regis]] and visit two of Wentworth's old naval friends, Captain Harville and Captain Benwick. While there, Louisa rashly jumps off some high steps in the hopes Wentworth will catch her; he does not, and she sustains a head injury. Afterwards, Anne goes to Bath to stay with her father and sister. Sir Walter and his eldest daughter Elizabeth reveal they have repaired their relationship with a previously disreputable cousin, Mr. Elliot, the heir to the Elliot baronetcy and estate. Anne is introduced to him, and they realise that they briefly saw each other in Lyme. Much to Lady Russell's pleasure, Mr. Elliot begins to court Anne, but she remains uncertain of his true character. Meanwhile, Louisa has recovered and become engaged to Captain Benwick. Wentworth arrives in Bath and encounters Anne on several occasions, though their conversations are brief.\n\nAnne learns from an old friend, Mrs. Smith, that Mr. Elliot is bankrupt and only interested in marrying Anne to help ensure his inheritance from her father. Anne is told that Mr. Elliot wishes to keep the baronet from possibly marrying Mrs. Clay to produce a male heir. Soon after, Wentworth overhears Anne talking with Captain Harville about the constancy of a woman's love, and writes her a letter declaring that he still cares for her. Anne quickly finds him and the two happily walk off down a street, arm in arm. That night at a party, Wentworth announces his intention to marry Anne, much to Mr. Elliot's consternation. The final scene shows Wentworth and Anne on a naval ship, happy to be together.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Amanda Root]] as [[Anne Elliot]]\n* [[Ciar\u00e1n Hinds]] as Captain [[Frederick Wentworth (Persuasion)|Frederick Wentworth]]\n* [[Susan Fleetwood]] as Lady Russell\n* [[Corin Redgrave]] as Sir Walter Elliot\n* [[Fiona Shaw]] as Mrs. Croft\n* [[John Woodvine]] as Admiral Croft\n* [[Phoebe Nicholls]] as Elizabeth Elliot\n* [[Samuel West]] as Mr. Elliot\n* [[Sophie Thompson]] as Mary Musgrove\n* [[Judy Cornwell]] as Mrs. Musgrove\n* [[Simon Russell Beale]] as Charles Musgrove\n* [[Felicity Dean]] as Mrs. Clay\n* [[Roger Hammond (actor)|Roger Hammond]] as Mr. Musgrove\n* Emma Roberts as Louisa Musgrove\n* [[Victoria Hamilton]] as Henrietta Musgrove\n* [[Robert Glenister]] as Captain Harville\n* [[Richard McCabe]] as Captain Benwick\n* [[Helen Schlesinger]] as Mrs. Smith\n* Jane Wood as Nurse Rooke\n* [[David Collings]] as Mr. Shepherd\n* Darlene Johnson as Lady Dalrymple\n* Cinnamon Faye as Miss Carteret\n* Isaac Maxwell-Hunt as Henry Hayter\n* [[Roger Llewellyn]] as Sir Henry Willoughby\n* [[Sally George]] as Mrs. Harville\n* Rhys Alexander Brown as Baby of Anne and Frederick\n{{div col end}}\n\n== Production ==\n\n=== Conception and adaptation ===\n[[File:NorthangerPersuasionTitlePage.jpg|thumb|Original cover of ''Persuasion'']]\nThe filming of ''Persuasion'' coincided with a sudden resurgence of [[Jane Austen]] adaptations, as it was one of six such productions released during the mid-1990s.{{sfn|Parrill|2002|p=5}} The media dubbed the phenomenon \"Austenmania\".{{sfn|Higson|2011|p=133}} While it was common for a successful adaptation to lead to the production of others, this surge in Austen's popularity involved many simultaneous projects\u2014''Persuasion''{{'}}s production, for instance, coincided with the TV serial ''[[Pride and Prejudice (1995 TV series)|Pride and Prejudice]]'' and the feature film ''[[Sense and Sensibility (film)|Sense and Sensibility]]''.{{sfn|Giddings|Selby|2001|p=100}}{{sfn|Parrill|2002|pp=6\u20137}} Despite the surge, film scholar Andrew Higson and others argue that there is little evidence that the various producers\u2014who were employed by different companies\u2014communicated when conceiving their adaptations.{{sfn|Higson|2011|p=135}}{{sfn|Parrill|2002|pp=5\u20136}}\n\nThe idea for a film version of the 1817 Austen novel ''[[Persuasion (novel)|Persuasion]]'' began with the English producer [[Fiona Finlay (producer)|Fiona Finlay]], who had wanted to create an adaptation for several years.{{sfn|Giddings|Selby|2001|p=100}} The novel had last been adapted by [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] in a [[Persuasion (1971 TV series)|1971 serial]] starring [[Ann Firbank]].{{sfn|Cardwell|2014|p=88}} Finlay felt that the \"very romantic\" story was one \"everyone can relate to. There's something very touching about long-lost love\".{{sfn|Higson|2011|p=140}} She approached the writer [[Nick Dear]] about adapting it for television; Finlay had enjoyed his contributions to theatre, particularly his play about [[William Hogarth]], ''The Art of Success''.<ref name=Dearinterview /> Dear first suggested they try one of Austen's other works\u2014either ''[[Sense and Sensibility]]'' or ''[[Pride and Prejudice]]''\u2014but agreed to adapt ''Persuasion'' after reading it. Dear considered the novel\u2014the author's last completed work\u2014a more mature story than the others.{{sfn|Giddings|Selby|2001|p=100}}\n\nDear later wrote that ''Persuasion'' was superficially \"a love story in the [[Cinderella]] mould\" but it was also one of \"realism and truthfulness\", particularly in telling the story of two people separated and then reunited.{{sfn|Dear|1996}} He spent two years working on a script,{{sfn|Giddings|Selby|2001|p=100}} and found this task difficult for several reasons. First, he needed to find a structure that would be faithful to the novel. Second, his protagonist barely spoke for the first half, and \"therefore can't motor the action along as a central character conventionally does\".<ref name=Dearinterview /> Adapting Austen's wit was another challenge; much could not be used \"because it's almost all in the author's voice telling us about characters, with a certain wit or lightness that came from the characters themselves. It's a craft job, interpreting the novel for oneself and then finding a film language for it\".<ref name=Dearinterview>{{Cite news |title=Production Notes |publisher=[[Sony Pictures Classics]] |date=25 September 1995 |url=http://www.sonymoviechannel.com/movies/persuasion/details |access-date=19 March 2015 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402122335/http://www.sonymoviechannel.com/movies/persuasion/details |archive-date=2 April 2015 }}</ref>\n\nAn experienced theatre and television serial director, Roger Michell was chosen to direct ''Persuasion'', in what was to be his first feature film.<ref name=BostonGlobe1997 />{{sfn|Cardwell|2014|p=89}} As a young child, Michell had been an admirer of Austen's, which set him apart from his male classmates. \"I was the only boy in my class who took Austen as a special paper\", he said.

This flamboyance is especially clear to modern viewers, who live in a culture where \"real men\" are expected to care little for their clothing.{{sfn|Richards|2003|p=114}} Conversely, Wentworth is typically depicted in the film wearing naval uniforms, which is a contrast to [[Bryan Marshall]]'s version of the character in the 1971 adaptation.

Sarah R. Morrison observes that the film's version of Anne articulates thoughts that the character would never say in the novel. Morrison cites Anne's adamant defence of her visit to Mrs. Smith\u2014where Anne visits a poor old friend rather than go to the party of a titled relative\u2014in the film as an example, as \"Austen's narrator makes it abundantly clear that Anne would never presume to dispute with her father upon such terms of absolute equality\".{{sfn|Morrison|1999}} The film's Anne also engages in actions not visible in the novel, such as her haste to stop Wentworth from leaving a musical concert when he feels demeaned by disparaging comments about his profession. Morrison attributes these differences to the difficulty in adapting novel to film, particularly as the latter form lacks a narrator to convey Anne's inner thoughts.{{sfn|Morrison|1999}}\n\nThe film also expands upon Austen's subtle characterisation by exaggerating the emotions of characters and certain scenes. For example, in the novel during an early party, Anne offers to play the pianoforte as usual; while doing so, she is slightly tearful but also \"extremely glad to be employed\" and \"unobserved\". Conversely, Dear's screenplay has Wentworth quickly giving up his seat to Anne and then immediately dancing with the Musgrove sisters, furthering the contrast between Anne and the others.{{sfn|Stovel|2006|p=188}} According to David Monaghan, Austen's novel displays a \"relatively radical vision\" of societal change, such as the rise of a professional class challenging the old order of [[landed gentry]]. Monaghan posits that this vision appealed to Dear and Michell, who used visuals and movement to emphasise this change. However, the two \"deviate significantly\" from the source material by depicting Anne and Wentworth as \"single-mindedly oriented\" to the future and thus 20th-century viewers' sensibilities.{{sfn|Monaghan|2009|p=129}}\n\n[[Sue Parrill]] observes that ''Persuasion''{{'}}s larger production budget, which allowed the crew to film much content on location, \"enabled the filmmakers to make fuller use of setting for symbolism and for creation of mood\".{{sfn|Parrill|2002|p=165}} The weather, for instance, is particularly important to Anne's state of mind in the novel.{{sfn|Parrill|2002|pp=165\u201366}} ''Persuasion''{{'}}s opening scenes establish its historical context as well as the financial predicament in which the Elliot family finds itself.{{sfn|Parrill|2002|pp=166\u201367}} Indeed, for Rachel Brownstein, by opening the film with a depiction of sailors, the director is confronting a common complaint about Austen's works\u2014her failure to mention the Napoleonic Wars.{{sfn|Brownstein|2001|p=18}} The juxtaposition between the navy and the Elliots establishes their differences, with the former group discussing the fall of [[Napoleon]] and the latter group discussing the relatively minor inconvenience of overspending.{{sfn|Parrill|2002|p=167}}\n\n=== Class and gender ===\n{{Quote box\n | quote=\"The story essentially describes an old order fading away into decadence, and a new tribe, a meritocracy, coming to the fore.

Carole M. Dole notes that, among the many productions of Austen's work that appeared in the 1990s, ''Persuasion'' was the only one to \"insistently draw attention to class issues\", and \"provide striking visual testimony to the workings of the British class system\".{{sfn|Dole|2001|p=60}} The film, she adds, accomplishes this in part by focusing on the servants' faces, gauging their negative reactions to events.{{sfn|Dole|2007}} Richards, too, finds Michell \"visually more aware\" of the lower classes, adding that the film's inclusion of black servants alludes to the \"colonial sources of wealth\" supporting those superior in class and rank.{{sfn|Richards|2003|p=117}} Anne-Marie Scholz writes that the film and Emma Thompson's ''Sense and Sensibility'' both highlight the theme of class, but in different ways. Unlike ''Sense and Sensibility'', ''Persuasion'' depicts general class divisions rather than just how the working class impacts the protagonists\u2014the camera focuses on the faces and expressions of servants and working people, personifying them.{{sfn|Scholz|2013|p=140}}\n\nIn Michell's opinion, Austen was a \"[[Protofeminism|proto-feminist]]\" who possessed a \"clear-sighted vision of the ways the world is tilted against women\".<ref name=philly /> As evidence, Michell cites a book scene in which Anne discusses how songs and proverbs about women's fickleness were all written by men.<ref name=philly /> Scholz argues that Anne's marginal status as a woman in the film is linked to that of the servants; the parallel between class and gender is conveyed with Anne's trip to Uppercross in a cart containing animals.{{sfn|Scholz|2013|p=140}} Julianne Pidduck adds that the director \"pointedly foregrounds themes of class and gendered social constraint by juxtaposing the stuffy interiors of mannered society with the inviting, open horizons of the sea\".{{sfn|Pidduck|2000|p=129}} As an example, Pidduck discusses Anne's stay in a gated residence in Bath, where she gazes out of an upper story window in search of Wentworth on the streets below. To her, Wentworth and the sea represent freedom and possibility.{{sfn|Pidduck|2000|p=129}}\n\n== Reception ==\n\n=== Release ===\n''Persuasion'' premiered on 16 April 1995, [[Easter Day]], on the British television channel [[BBC Two]].
