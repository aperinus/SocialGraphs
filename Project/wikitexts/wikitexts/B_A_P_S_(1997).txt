Their plan is to one day open the world's first combination hair salon and soul food restaurant if they ever get enough money. Their boyfriends, Ali ([[Pierre Edwards]]) and James ([[Anthony Johnson (actor)|A.J. Johnson]]), hope to one day own a luxury cab company.\n\nNisi and Mickey hear about a contest for a [[video vixen|video girl]] where the winner gets $10,000 and spend all their savings to fly to [[Los Angeles]] for Nisi to compete. On the plane ride there, Nisi reads a book on [[etiquette]] and she and Mickey discuss their new hairstyles, which are so tall they block the movie projector.\n\nAlthough Nisi does not land the dancing girl role, a man named Antonio spots them at the auditions and offers them the same amount of money to be in a different music video and invites them to a [[Beverly Hills]] mansion. Once they arrive, they learn about the real reason they were brought there, which was for Nisi to pretend to be the granddaughter of a woman the owner of the house, an aging Mr. Blakemore ([[Martin Landau]]), once loved when he was younger named Lily. They agree to the plan, but eventually grow fond of Mr. Blakemore and take care of him and refuse to take his money.\n\nFeeling guilty for deceiving Mr. Blakemore, they plan to return to Decatur and leave a confession letter for him to read after they are gone. However, before they can depart, Mr. Blakemore is rushed to the hospital. Nisi tries to confess to him at his bedside but he silences her before she can finish and passes away soon afterwards. Mr. Blakemore's lawyer, Tracy Shaw ([[Troy Byer]]), informs them that he knew all along that Nisi was not Lily's granddaughter because Lily never had any children.\n\nBack at the mansion, Nisi, Mickey, and their boyfriends are preparing to return to Decatur. Mr. Blakemore's lawyer arrives and read's his last will and testament, in which he calls the girls his \"B.A.P.S\", short for [[Black American Princess]]es, and gives them some portion of his wealth. The film ends with Nisi and Mickey opening their combination hair salon and restaurant, which they name \"Lily'z\".\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Halle Berry]] as  Denise \u201cNisi\u201d\n* [[Martin Landau]] as  Mr. Donald Blakemore\n* [[Ian Richardson]] as Mr. Manley\n* [[Natalie Desselle-Reid]] as  Tamika \u201cMickey\u201d\n* [[Troy Byer]] as  Tracy Shaw\n* Luigi Amodeo as  Antonio\n* Jonathan Fried as  Isaac\n* [[Pierre Edwards]] as  Ali\n* [[Anthony Johnson (actor)|A.J.
