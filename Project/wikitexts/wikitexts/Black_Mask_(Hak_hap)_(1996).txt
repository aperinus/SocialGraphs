However, he is really a former test subject for a highly secretive [[supersoldier]] project and the instructor of a special commando unit dubbed \"701\". The 701 squad is used for many government missions, but after one of the agents kills a team of policemen in an uncontrollable rage, the government decides to abort the project and eliminate all the subjects. Tsui Chik helped the surviving 701 agents flee the extermination attempt. Having escaped, Tsui Chik went separate ways from his team and lived in Hong Kong. Later at night he discovers that the rest of the team were responsible for a violent crime spree that was beyond the capability of the local police. He sets out to get rid of them, donning a mask and hat using the [[superhero]] alias of The Black Mask. Having lost the ability to feel pain due to the surgery performed on the super-soldiers by the military, Black Mask is almost invulnerable.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Jet Li]] as Tsui Chik / Black Mask\n* [[Sean Lau|Lau Ching-wan]] as Inspector Shek Wai-Ho\n* [[Karen Mok]] as Tracy Lee\n* [[Fran\u00e7oise Yip]] as Yeuk-Lan\n* [[Patrick Lung]] as Commander Hung Kuk\n* [[Anthony Wong (Hong Kong actor)|Anthony Wong]] as King Kau\n* [[Hung Yan-yan|Xiong Xin-xin]] as Jimmy\n* [[Moses Chan]] as 701 Squad Member\n* Henry Fong Ping as Ricky Tai\n* Shut Mei-yee as Chief of Library\n* Szeto Wai-cheuk as Szeto\n* [[Chung King-fai]] as Commissioner of Police\n* Ken Lok as Sergeant Crap\n* [[Lawrence Ah Mon]] as Operating Room Doctor\n*[[Dion Lam]] as Sour\n* Mike Ian Lambert as 701 Squad Member\n\n== Release ==\n''Black Mask'' grossed over {{US$|26 million}} ({{HK$|200 million}}) at the worldwide box office, including {{US$|10 million}} in Asia.<ref name=mask/> Released on 9 November 1996, ''Black Mask'' grossed a moderate HK$13,286,788 ({{US$|{{To USD|13286788|HKG|year=1996|round=yes}}|long=yes}}) during its Hong Kong box office run.<ref>{{cite web |title=Black Mask |url=https://hkmdb.com/db/movies/view.mhtml?id=8222 |website=[[Hong Kong Movie Database]] |access-date=1 April 2022}}</ref>\n\nIn May 1999, home video distributor [[Artisan Entertainment]] released a re-edited version in the United States theatrically. It grossed a reasonable US$4,449,692 ($4,545 per screen) in its opening weekend, and grossed a total of US$12,504,289.<ref>{{cite news|title= The Action's Everything in 'Black Mask'|work=Los Angeles Times|date=17 May 1999|url= http://articles.latimes.com/1999/may/17/entertainment/ca-38011|access-date=11 September 2010|first=Eric|last=Harrison}}</ref>\n\nDVD sales for ''Black Mask'' totalled {{US$|48.57 million}} ({{HK$|380 million}}) in North America and more than {{US$|50 million}} worldwide.<ref name=mask/> [[Lionsgate Home Entertainment]] (successor to Artisan when it acquired in 2003) released a Blu-ray version in the United States on 2 September 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/34400/black-mask/|title=Black Mask (Blu-ray)|last=Tyner|first=Adam|work=[[DVD Talk]]|date=23 August 2008|access-date=20 June 2015}}</ref>\n\n== Alternate versions ==\nThe film is recognised for having multiple versions: Hong Kong (Cantonese), [[Taiwanese Minnan|Taiwanese]] ([[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]]), English (export), United Kingdom (distributed by [[Sony BMG|BMG]]) and United States (distributed by [[Artisan Entertainment]]).\n\n=== Hong Kong/Taiwanese versions ===\nFor the Cantonese version, the original Mei Ah DVD is cut for gore, but the remastered DVD restores a scene of blood-spurting. The French DVD features the Hong Kong version in the correct form, but contains no English [[subtitles]].\n\nFeatured on DVDs distributed in [[Taiwan]] by Long Shong, Ritek and Thundermedia, there is approximately 100 seconds footage exclusive to the Taiwanese version:\n\n# Extended dialogue between Tracy and other library staff where they discuss what she would do with Tsui Chik if they cohabited.\n# An entire scene where King Kau and a woman are together \u2013 he watches her dance, proceeds to have sex and then excitedly shoots her with a water gun and smashes a light.\n# An exchange of gestures between Inspector Shek and King Kau.\n# King Kau saluting Inspector Shek in an exasperated form.\n# A member of the 701 squad impaling himself onto metal sticks and spitting blood. Shortly after trying to retaliate and getting swiftly defeated, Black Mask entangles the metal sticks (whilst still in his body).\n# Shots of bullet-impacting when Black Mask shoots the 701 thugs to save Tracy.\n# A shot of a bullet hitting the arm of a 701 thug whilst choking Tracy.\n# During the hospital sequence, a scene where a 701 thug grabs two cops arms and breaks them.\n# The thug smashes a cop's head with his hands.\n# More footage of the thug getting shot by police.\n# A shot of Yeuk Lan's shoulder being shot with blood shooting out.\n# Some more bullet hits on masked cops when the other zombie grabs his gun.\n# Inspector Shek removes a severed thug's arm that had been clutching onto his shoulder.\n# Shots of Black Mask bleeding after being stabbed.\n# More footage of Tracy obtaining a blood bag.\n# A shot of Black Mask's blood after being stabbed with a pipe tube.\n\nBoth Hong Kong and Taiwanese releases maintain the green-tinting of the film.\n\n=== English versions ===\nAn English version similar to the Hong Kong version was produced for export (featured on the Spanish DVD), but BMG and Artisan decided to make their own. Whilst only occasionally replacing music on the UK release, Artisan commissioned a brand-new English [[Hip Hop]] soundtrack \u2013 therefore, removing any reference to the original (despite using excerpts from it in their trailers). Despite a tendency of trimming non-action scenes, the Artisan and BMG versions not only contain all gory content, but also some non-violent scenes not found in any other version:\n\n# Tsui Chik looking for Inspector Shek.\n# A few shots of Black Mask's hide-out.\n# Inspector Shek advising Yeuk Lan to seek Tsui Chik.\n\n== Reception ==\n[[Lawrence Van Gelder]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' called it \"long on flying bodies, bullets and blood and short on credibility\".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/library/film/051599mask-film-review.html|title='Black Mask': Nonstop Action, Ridiculous Plot|last=Van Gelder|first=Lawrence|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=15 May 1999|access-date=20 June 2015}}</ref> Marc Savlov of ''[[The Austin Chronicle]]'' rated it 3/5 stars and called it \"a bloodily exhilarating piece of hyper-kinetic filmmaking\".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.austinchronicle.com/calendar/film/1999-05-21/black-mask/|title=Black Mask|last=Savlov|first=Marc|work=[[The Austin Chronicle]]|date=21 May 1999|access-date=20 June 2015}}</ref> [[Nathan Rabin]] of ''[[The A.V.
