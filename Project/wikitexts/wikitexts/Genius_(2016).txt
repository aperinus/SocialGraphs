Scott Fitzgerald]] and [[Ernest Hemingway]]. He lives in a cottage just outside the city with his wife and five daughters.\n\nOne day, in his office, he reads the drafts of ''O Lost'', a novel by [[Thomas Wolfe]]. Struck by the content, Perkins decides to publish it and begins to collaborate with the author. It is eventually published as ''[[Look Homeward, Angel]]'' and proves to be a commercial success: 15 thousand copies sold in a month.\n\nPerkins and Wolfe become best friends, while Wolfe's relationship with [[Aline Bernstein]], a married woman twenty years his senior, is severely tested after the novel's publication. Max manages to publish Wolfe's successful second novel, ''[[Of Time and the River]]'', after several years of exhausting revision.\n\nWolfe is in Paris where he follows the events remotely, thanks to news received from Perkins. On his return to New York, he immediately goes to work, writing his new book. His turbulent character leads him to quarrel with Perkins, destroying the relationship between them, resulting in Wolfe turning to another editor.\n\nAline finally leaves Wolfe, because she feels he needs to experience how to be truly alone. After Perkins has reconciled himself with Wolfe's absence, a phone call comes from Wolfe's mother: he has contracted [[miliary tuberculosis]]. Despite surgery, Wolfe shows no signs of improving. After a few weeks he dies but before dying he writes a letter to Max, expressing his immense affection for him.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Colin Firth]] as [[Maxwell Perkins]]\n* [[Jude Law]] as [[Thomas Wolfe]]\n* [[Nicole Kidman]] as [[Aline Bernstein]]\n* [[Dominic West]] as [[Ernest Hemingway]]\n* [[Guy Pearce]] as [[F.
