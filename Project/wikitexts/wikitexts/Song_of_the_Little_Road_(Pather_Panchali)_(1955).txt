It is an adaptation of [[Bibhutibhushan Bandyopadhyay]]'s 1929 Bengali [[Pather Panchali (novel)|novel of the same name]], and marked Ray's directorial debut. Featuring [[Subir Banerjee]], [[Kanu Banerjee]], [[Karuna Banerjee]], Uma Dasgupta, Pinaki Sengupta, [[Chunibala Devi]] and being the first film in ''[[The Apu Trilogy]]'', ''Pather Panchali'' depicts the childhood travails of the protagonist Apu and his elder sister Durga  amidst the harsh village life of their poor family.\n\nProduction was interrupted because of funding problems and it took nearly three years for the film to be completed. The film was shot mainly [[location shooting|on location]], had a [[Low-budget film|limited budget]],{{efn|name=budgetamount|}} featured mostly amateur actors, and was made by an inexperienced crew. The [[sitar]] player [[Ravi Shankar]] composed the film's soundtrack and score using classical Indian [[raga]]s. [[Subrata Mitra]] was in charge of the cinematography while editing was handled by [[Dulal Dutta]]. Following its premiere on 3 May 1955 during an exhibition at New York's [[Museum of Modern Art]], ''Pather Panchali'' was released in Calcutta later the same year to an enthusiastic reception.

Critics have praised its realism, humanity, and soul-stirring qualities, while others have called its slow pace a drawback, and some have condemned it for romanticising poverty. Scholars have commented on the film's [[wikt:lyrical|lyrical]] quality and [[Realism (arts)|realism]] (influenced by [[Italian neorealism]]), its portrayal of the poverty and small delights of daily life, and the use of what the author Darius Cooper has termed the \"epiphany of wonder\", among other themes.\n\nThe tale of Apu's life is continued in the two subsequent installments of Ray's trilogy: ''[[Aparajito]]'' (''The Unvanquished'', 1956) and ''[[Apur Sansar]]'' (''The World of Apu'', 1959). ''Pather Panchali'' is described as a turning point in Indian cinema, as it was among the films that pioneered the [[Parallel cinema|Parallel Cinema]] movement, which espoused authenticity and social realism. The first film from independent India to attract major international critical attention, it won India's [[National Film Award for Best Feature Film]] in 1955, the Best Human Document award at the [[1956 Cannes Film Festival]], and several other awards, establishing Ray as one of the country's most distinguished filmmakers. It is often featured in [[List of films considered the best|lists of the greatest films ever made]].\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1910s Nischindipur, rural [[Bengal]], Harihar Roy earns a meagre living as a ''[[pujari]]'' (priest) but dreams of a better career as a poet and playwright. His wife Sarbajaya cares for their children, Durga and Apu, and Harihar's elderly cousin, Indir Thakrun. Because of their limited resources, Sarbajaya resents having to share her home with the old Indir, who often steals food from their already bare kitchen. At times, Sarbajaya's taunts become offensive, forcing Indir to take temporary refuge in the home of another relative. Durga is fond of Indir and often gives her fruit stolen from a wealthy neighbour's orchard. One day, the neighbour's wife accuses Durga of stealing a bead necklace (which Durga denies) and blames Sarbajaya for encouraging her tendency to steal.\n\nAs the elder sibling, Durga cares for Apu with motherly affection but spares no opportunity to tease him. Together, they share life's simple joys: sitting quietly under a tree, viewing pictures in a travelling vendor's [[Bioscope show|bioscope]], running after the candy man who passes through, and watching a ''[[Jatra (theatre)|jatra]]'' (folk theatre) performed by an acting troupe. Every evening, they are delighted by the sound of a distant train's whistle. One day, they run to catch a glimpse of the train, only to find Indir dead upon return.\n\nUnable to earn a good living in the village, Harihar travels to the city to seek a better job. He promises that he will return with money to repair their dilapidated house. During his absence, the family sinks deeper into poverty, and Sarbajaya grows increasingly lonely and bitter. One day during the [[monsoon]] season, Durga plays in the downpour, catches a cold and develops a high fever. Adequate medical care being unavailable, the fever worsens, and on a night of incessant rain and gusty winds, she dies. Harihar returns home and starts to show Sarbajaya the merchandise he has brought from the city. A silent Sarbajaya breaks down at her husband's feet, and Harihar cries out in grief as he discovers that Durga has died. The family decide to leave their ancestral home for [[Benaras]]. As they pack, Apu finds the necklace Durga had earlier denied stealing; he throws it into a pond. Apu and his parents leave the village on an ox-cart.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n\n* [[Kanu Banerjee]] as Harihar Roy\n* [[Karuna Banerjee]] as Sarbajaya Roy\n* [[Subir Banerjee]] as Apurba Roy (Little Apu)\n*Pinaki Sengupta as Apurba Roy (Apu)\n* Runki Banerjee as Durga Roy (child)\n* [[Uma Dasgupta]] as Durga Roy (teenager)\n* [[Chunibala Devi]] as Indir Thakrun, the old aunt\n* [[Tulsi Chakraborty]] as Prasanna, school teacher\n* Haren Banerjee as Chinibas\n}}\n\n==Production==\n\n===Novel and title===\n{{main|Pather Panchali (novel)}}\n[[Bibhutibhushan Bandopadhyay]]'s novel ''[[Pather Panchali (novel)|Pather Panchali]]'' is a classic [[bildungsroman]] (a type of [[coming-of-age story]]) in the canon of [[Bengali literature]].{{sfn|Gokulsing|Dissanayake|2013|p=277}}{{sfn|Gugelberger|1996|p=173}} It first appeared as a [[serial (literature)|serial]] in a Calcutta periodical in 1928,{{sfn|Robinson|1989|p=74}} and was published as a book the next year.<ref>{{cite book |last=Sekhar |first=Saumitra |year=2012 |chapter=Pather Panchali |chapter-url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Pather_Panchali |editor1-last=Islam |editor1-first=Sirajul |editor1-link=Sirajul Islam |editor2-last=Jamal |editor2-first=Ahmed A. |title=Banglapedia: National Encyclopedia of Bangladesh |edition=Second |publisher=[[Asiatic Society of Bangladesh]] |access-date=8 May 2016 |archive-date=1 April 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160401123952/http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Pather_Panchali |url-status=live }}</ref> The novel depicts a poor family's struggle to survive in their rural ancestral home and the growing up of Apu, the son of the family.

The scene of Apu and Durga running to catch a glimpse of the train is not in the novel, in which neither child sees the train, although they try. Durga's fatal fever is attributed to a monsoon downpour in the film, but is unexplained in the novel. The ending of the film\u2014the family's departure from the village\u2014is not the end of the novel.{{sfn|Robinson|1989|p=75}}\n\nRay tried to extract a simple theme from the random sequences of significant and trivial episodes of the ''Pather Panchali'' novel, while preserving what [[W. Andrew Robinson]] describes as the \"loitering impression\" it creates.{{sfn|Robinson|1989|p=75}} According to Ray, \"the script had to retain some of the rambling quality of the novel because that in itself contained a clue to the feel of authenticity: life in a poor Bengali village does ramble.\"{{sfn|Ray|2005|p=33}} For Robinson, Ray's adaptation focuses mainly on Apu and his family, while Bandopadhyay's original featured greater detail about village life in general.{{sfn|Robinson|1989|pp=75\u201376}}\n\n===Casting===\nKanu Banerjee (who plays Harihar) was an established [[Cinema of West Bengal|Bengali film]] actor. Karuna Banerjee (Sarbajaya) was an amateur actress from the [[Indian People's Theatre Association]], and the wife of Ray's friend. Uma Dasgupta, who successfully auditioned for the part of Durga, also had prior theatre experience.{{sfn|Robinson|1989|pp=78\u201380}}\n\nFor the role of Apu, Ray advertised in newspapers for boys of ages five to seven. None of the candidates who auditioned fulfilled Ray's expectations, but his wife spotted a boy in their neighbourhood, and this boy, Subir Banerjee, was cast as Apu. (The surname of three of the main actors and two supporting actors happened to be [[Banerjee]], but they were not related to each other). The hardest role to fill was the wizened old Indir. Ray eventually found Chunibala Devi, a retired stage actress living in one of Calcutta's [[red-light district]]s, as the ideal candidate. Several minor roles were played by the villagers of [[Garia|Boral]], where ''Pather Panchali'' was filmed.{{sfn|Robinson|1989|pp=78\u201380}}\n\n===Filming===\n[[File:Patherpanchali 1.png|thumb|right|Apu and Durga running to catch a glimpse of a train, a famous scene of the film{{sfn|Cousins|2004|pp=237\u2013238}}]]\nShooting started on 27 October 1952.{{sfn|Robinson|1989|p=78}} Boral, a village near [[Calcutta]], was selected in early 1953 as the main location for principal photography, and night scenes were shot in-studio.{{sfn|Robinson|1989|p=78}} The technical team included several first-timers, including Ray himself and cinematographer [[Subrata Mitra]], who had never operated a film camera. Art director [[Bansi Chandragupta]] had professional experience, having worked with [[Jean Renoir]] on ''[[The River (1951 film)|The River]]'' (1951). Both Mitra and Chandragupta went on to establish themselves as respected professionals.{{sfn|Ettedgui|1999|pp=48\u201359}}{{sfn|Gulzar|Nihalni|Chatterjee|2003|p=539}}\n\nMitra had met Ray on the set of ''The River'', where Mitra was allowed to observe the production, take photographs and make notes about lighting for personal reference. Having become friends, Mitra kept Ray informed about the production and showed his photographs. Ray was impressed enough by them to promise him an assistant's position on ''Pather Panchali'', and when production neared, invited him to shoot the film. As the 21-year-old Mitra had no prior filmmaking experience, the choice was met with scepticism by those who knew of the production. Mitra himself later speculated that Ray was nervous about working with an established crew.{{sfn|Ettedgui|1999|p=50}}\n\nFunding was a problem from the outset. No producer was willing to finance the film, as it lacked stars, songs and action scenes.{{sfn|Robinson|1989|p=77}}{{sfn|Ray|2010|p=51}} On learning of Ray's plan, one producer, Mr Bhattacharya of Kalpana Movies, contacted author [[Bibhutibhushan Bandyopadhyay]]'s widow to request the filming rights and get the film made by [[Debaki Bose]], a well-established director.

''Pather Panchali'': Crtique}} In his 1958 ''New York Times'' review, Crowther writes that ''Pather Panchali'' delicately illustrates how \"poverty does not always nullify love\" and how even very poor people can enjoy the little pleasures of their world.<ref name=\"crowther\"/> Marie Seton describes how the film intersperses the depiction of poverty and the delights and pleasures of youth. She represents the bond between Durga and Indir, and their fate, as signifying a philosophical core: that both the young and the old die. Seton writes of the film's \"lyrical\" qualities, noting especially the imagery immediately before the onset of monsoon.{{sfn|Seton|2003|pp=81\u201384}} Robinson writes about a peculiar quality of \"lyrical happiness\" in the film, and states that ''Pather Panchali'' is \"about unsophisticated people shot through with great sophistication, and without a trace of condescension or inflated sentiment\".{{sfn|Robinson|1989|pp=95\u201396}}\n\nDarius Cooper discusses the use of different ''rasa'' in the film,{{sfn|Cooper|2000|pages=24\u201340}} observing Apu's repeated \"epiphany of wonder\",{{sfn|Cooper|2000|pages=24\u201326}}{{efn|name=camatkara|Darius Cooper uses the term \"epiphany of wonder\" to denote the ''rasa'' of ''camatkara''. He quotes [[Abhinavabharati]] by [[Abhinavagupta]] to explain the ''camatkara rasa'': \"...&nbsp;''camatkara'' is an uninterrupted (''acchina'') state of immersion (''avesha'') in an enjoyment characterized by the presence of a sensation of inner fullness (''trpti''). It might be said indeed that ''camatkara'' is the action proper to a tasting (''cam'') or enjoying subject, i.e., to a person immersed in the inner movement (''trpti'') of a magical (''adbhuta'') enjoyment.\" {{harv|Cooper|2000|pages=24\u201325}} Cooper says that through Apu the \"universe is revealed. To Apu is given the dominant quality of ''camatkara'', and it is through this sense of wonder that Apu is made to discover and enjoy not only the world that constantly surrounds him but also that other world created by his ''pratibha'' or imagination.\" {{harv|Cooper|2000|page=25}}\n}} brought about not only by what the boy sees around him, but also when he uses his imagination to create another world.{{sfn|Cooper|2000|page=25}} For Cooper, the immersive experience of the film corresponds to this epiphany of wonder. Stephen Teo uses the scene in which Apu and Durga discover railway tracks as an example of the gradual build-up of epiphany and the resulting immersive experience.{{sfn|Teo|2013|p=49}}\n\nSharmishtha Gooptu discusses the idea that the idyllic village life portrayed in ''Pather Panchali'' represents authentic Bengali village life, which disappeared during the upheavals of [[Partition of India|Partition]] in 1947. She suggests that the film seeks to connect an idealised, pre-partition past with the actual present of partitioned Bengal,{{sfn|Gooptu|2010|p=148}} and that it uses prototypes of rural Bengal to construct an image of the ideal village.{{sfn|Gooptu|2010|p=149}} In contrast to this idealism, Mitali Pati and Suranjan Ganguly point out how Ray used eye-level shots, natural lighting, long takes and other techniques to achieve realism.{{sfn|Pati|Ganguly|1996|page=417}} Mainak Biswas has written that ''Pather Panchali'' comes very close to the concept of Italian neorealism, as it has several passages with no dramatic development, even though the usual realities of life, such as the changing of seasons or the passing of a day, are concretely filmed.{{sfn|Biswas|2007|pp=87\u201388}}\n\n==Accolades==\n{{see also|List of awards and nominations received by Satyajit Ray}}\n''Pather Panchali'' has won many national and international awards.<ref name=ucscray>{{cite web|url=http://satyajitray.ucsc.edu/awards.html |title=Awards for Satyajit Ray |access-date=18 May 2008 |work= Ray Film and Study Collection |publisher=University of California \u2013 Santa Cruz | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20131017020808/http://satyajitray.ucsc.edu/awards.html | archive-date=17 October 2013}}</ref> At India's [[3rd National Film Awards]] in 1955, it was named [[National Film Award for Best Feature Film|Best Feature Film]] and [[National Film Award for Best Feature Film in Bengali|Best Bengali Feature Film]].<ref name=nfa>{{cite web|url=http://dff.nic.in/2011/3rd_nff_1956.pdf|title=3rd National Film Awards|publisher=[[Directorate of Film Festivals]]|access-date=5 December 2013|page=6 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131105232134/http://dff.nic.in/2011/3rd_nff_1956.pdf |archive-date=5 November 2013}}</ref> The next year, it competed for the [[Palme d'Or]] at Cannes,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/1956/allAward.html |title=Awards 1956 : All Awards |access-date=5 December 2013 |publisher=Festival de Cannes | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20131212020106/http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/1956/allAward.html |archive-date= 12 December 2013}}</ref> where it won Best Human Document<ref name=ucscray/> and an OCIC Award&nbsp;\u2013 Special Mention.{{sfn|Lyden|2009|pp=61\u201362}} More awards from film festivals across the world followed: the Vatican Award (Rome),{{sfn|Robinson|1989|p=366}} the Golden Carbao (Manila),<ref name=ucscray/> and the Diploma of Merit ([[Edinburgh International Film Festival|Edinburgh]]) in 1956;{{sfn|Robinson|1989|p=366}} the Selznick Golden Laurel for Best Film ([[Berlin International Film Festival|Berlin]]), the Golden Gate for Best Director and Best Picture ([[San Francisco International Film Festival|San Francisco]]) in 1957;{{sfn|Robinson|1989|p=366}} Best Film ([[Vancouver International Film Festival|Vancouver]]), and the Critics' Award for Best Film (Stratford) in 1958.{{sfn|Robinson|1989|p=366}}<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1958/07/14/archives/indian-film-honored-pather-panchali-wins-prize-at-stratford-ont.html |title=Indian Film Honored;
