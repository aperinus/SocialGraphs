The film stars [[Will Ferrell]] and [[Robert Duvall]] as a father and son who exploit their own sons' [[association football|soccer]] teams to try and beat the other. [[Mike Ditka]], [[Kate Walsh (actress)|Kate Walsh]] and [[Josh Hutcherson]] also star. It was released on May 13, 2005, to mixed reviews and grossed $56 million worldwide.\n\n==Plot==\nPhil Weston is an average person who had to endure his father Buck Weston's over-competitiveness throughout his life; his upbringing has left permanent mental scars. Now middle-aged and married, with a young son named Sam, Phil runs a small [[Dietary supplement|vitamin]] store, while Buck operates a chain of sporting good stores.\n\nBuck is coach of the Gladiators, the most successful little-league soccer team in the district. Sam is on the team, but to Phil's annoyance Buck keeps him on the bench, a humiliation he had also endured from him as a child. Buck eventually transfers Sam to the Tigers, the league's worst team.\n\nAt Sam's first game with the Tigers, their coach is absent. Rather than forfeit, Phil offers to coach them, a position he takes up permanently. However, despite his best efforts, the team does not improve. Desperate, Phil recruits [[Mike Ditka]], Buck's neighbor and hated enemy, as assistant coach. Enticed by the opportunity to beat Buck, Ditka accepts the position. Despite grueling training, the team continues to lose.\n\nDitka introduces Phil to two exceptionally talented Italian brothers named Gian Piero and Massimo, sons of a local butcher. Phil convinces their uncle to let them play for the Tigers. They have an immediate impact, scoring repeatedly. The resulting winning streak makes the team a serious contender in the league. After finally winning a few games, Phil and Buck bet, if the Gladiators win the championship, Phil will sell his store and work for Buck. If the Tigers win Buck gives Phil his prized possession, 'The [[Pel\u00e9]] Ball', the soccer ball struck by the famous player which Phil caught as a child and Buck took from him.\n\nMeanwhile, Ditka also introduces Phil to coffee, which rapidly changes him from a mild-mannered caring father, to an obnoxious, egotistical, over-competitive coach, not that different from his father, abusing kids and parents alike. The team's mantra becomes \"Get the ball to the [[Italians]]\", which, though effective, demoralizes the team. In an ultimate over-competitive act, Phil benches Sam for the entire semi-final game; furthermore, just prior to the game Ditka resigned as assistant coach due to Phil's unsportsmanlike behavior towards him, the kids and the rival team.\n\nIn the finals the Tigers face off against the Gladiators. At half-time, the score is 2\u20131 for the Gladiators. In a heart-to-heart discussion with Sam, Phil realizes the error of his ways. He tells his team to do exactly the opposite of what he taught them. Although the Gladiators score one more goal after half-time, the Tigers do not give up hope. Phil gives the goalie a vision test with glasses from the crowd. From there, Ambrose scores one goal\u2014making the score 3\u20132. After another goal, the score is tied. The team rallies and produces a spectacular team performance to win 4\u20133, with Sam scoring the winning goal against his uncle Bucky (Buck's son from his second wife and Phil's younger half-brother, who was born on the exact day as Sam), using a move that he practiced when his dad benched him in the semi-finals.\n\nPhil apologizes to Ditka for his earlier behavior, and Ditka accepts his apology. Honoring the bet, Buck tries to give Phil the ball, but Phil refuses. Making peace with his father, they merge their businesses, realizing there is more to life than winning.\n\nThe film ends with an adapted version of the \"He's Got Balls\" commercial originally produced by Buck. In it, the entire Tigers team appears, announcing the merger of Phil's vitamin shop\u2014Phil's Pills\u2014and Buck's Sporting Goods Store. The team shouts, after the \"He's got balls\" line, \"And vitamins.\" Mike Ditka is last seen watching and criticizing the commercial before the credits roll.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast list|\n* [[Will Ferrell]] as Phil Weston (the new coach of Tigers)\n* [[Robert Duvall]] as Buck Weston, Phil's father (the coach of Gladiators)\n* [[Mike Ditka]] as Himself\n* [[Kate Walsh (actress)|Kate Walsh]] as Barbara Weston, Phil's wife\n* [[Josh Hutcherson]] as Bucky Weston, Buck & Janice's son and Phil's younger half-brother (Gladiators #10)\n* [[Steven Anthony Lawrence]] as Mark Avery (Tigers #5)\n* [[Dylan McLaughlin]] as Sam Weston, Phil & Barbara's son (former Gladiators #13, later new recruit Tigers #2)\n* Jeremy Bergman as Hunter Davidson (Tigers #9)\n* Elliott Cho as Byong Sun Hogan-Jones (Tigers #6)\n* Dallas McKinney as Connor Ryan (Tigers #1 from Goalie)\n* [[Rachael Harris]] as Ann Hogan, Byong Sun's adoptive mother\n* [[David Herman]] as Referee\n* [[Musetta Vander]] as Janice Weston, Buck's 2nd wife and Phil's stepmother\n* [[Laura Kightlinger]] as Donna Jones, Byong Sun's adoptive other mother\n* Erik Walker as Ambrose Hanna (Tigers #4)\n* [[Jim Turner (comedian)|Jim Turner]] as Jim Davidson \"The Captain\", Hunter's father\n* Francesco Liotti as Gian Piero, Massimo's twin brother (new recruit Tigers #7)\n* Alessandro Ruggiero as Massimo, Gian Piero's twin brother (new recruit Tigers #11)\n* Sammy Fine as Jack Watson (Tigers #8)\n* Timmy Deters as Alex\n* [[Julia Campbell]] as Janet Davidson, Hunter's mother\n* [[Phill Lewis]] as John Ryan, Connor's father\n* [[David Bowe (actor)|David Bowe]] as Forest Avery, Mark's father\n* [[Matt Winston]] as Tom Hanna, Ambrose's father\n* Joseph R.
