The film preserves the novel's [[metafiction]]al narrative style by presenting the story as a book being read by a grandfather to his sick grandson.\n\nThe film was first released in the United States on September 25, 1987,<ref name=HR/> and was well received by critics at the time.

Please add nothing without checking wordcount first-->\n\nA grandfather reads a novel to his sick grandson, who initially dismisses the story.\n\nThe tale is about Buttercup, a young woman living on a farm in the fictional kingdom of Florin. Whenever she tells farmhand Westley to do something, he always complies, saying, \"As you wish.\" The two fall in love, and Westley leaves to seek his fortune overseas so they can marry. When his ship is attacked by the [[Dread Pirate Roberts]], Westley is presumed dead.\n\nFive years later, Buttercup is forcibly betrothed to Florin's Prince Humperdinck. Before the wedding, she is kidnapped by three outlaws; a small [[Sicilian people|Sicilian]] man named Vizzini, a giant from [[Greenland]] named Fezzik, and a [[Spaniards|Spanish]] [[fencing]] master named [[Inigo Montoya]], who seeks revenge against a [[Polydactyly|six-fingered man]] who murdered his father. A masked man in black pursues them, as does Prince Humperdinck and his soldiers.\n\nThe man in black confronts the outlaws atop the Cliffs of Insanity. He defeats Inigo in a fencing duel and knocks him out, chokes Fezzik into unconsciousness, and tricks Vizzini into drinking a deadly poison. He forcibly flees with Buttercup. Buttercup correctly guesses he is the Dread Pirate Roberts, berates him for killing Westley, and shoves him into a gorge. While tumbling down, he shouts, \"As you wish!\" Realizing it is Westley, she throws herself into the gorge after him, and they are reunited.\n\nAs they make their way through the dangerous Fire Swamp to avoid Humperdinck and his men, Westley explains how \"Dread Pirate Roberts\" is an inherited title that he assumed when the previous Roberts wished to retire. Having found Buttercup, Westley intends to surrender the title to another. Humperdinck captures the pair after they emerge from the Fire Swamp. Buttercup agrees to return with Humperdinck after he promises to release Westley. Humperdinck secretly orders his sadistic [[vizier]], Count Rugen, to take Westley to his torture chamber, the Pit of Despair. Before being knocked out, Westley notices that Rugen has six fingers on his right hand.\n\nWhen Buttercup threatens suicide if the wedding happens, Humperdinck falsely promises to find Westley for her. His real plan is to start a war with the neighboring country of Guilder by killing Buttercup and framing Guilder for it. He had secretly hired Vizzini to do this before Westley interfered. Meanwhile, Fezzik becomes part of the brute squad ordered to clear the thieves' forest before the wedding. He finds a drunk Inigo living in the forest who he sobers up and tells him about Rugen. Inigo realizes he needs Westley's help to storm the castle.\n\nButtercup learns that Humperdinck failed to search for Westley and calls him a coward. Enraged, Humperdinck imprisons Buttercup and tortures Westley, seemingly to death. Inigo and Fezzik, who followed Westley's screams through the forest, find his body and bring him to Miracle Max, a [[folk healer]]. The \"[[Death#Problems of definition|mostly dead]]\" Westley is revived by Max, though he is severely weakened.\n\nAs Westley, Inigo, and Fezzik invade the castle, Humperdinck panics and orders the in-progress wedding ceremony to be shortened. Inigo encounters and chases Rugen before Rugen throws a knife at Inigo that pierces Inigo's abdomen. Rugen realizes who Inigo is and taunts him about his father's death. Inigo removes the knife and despite the pain he manages to kill Rugen. Westley locates Buttercup, who is about to commit suicide, believing she is now married to Humperdinck. Westley assures her the marriage is invalid because she never completed her wedding vows. Humperdinck finds them, and challenges Westley to a duel, but Westley wills himself to stand and intimidates the prince into surrendering just before Inigo finds them. They hear Fezzik's voice outside and he shows them four horses he procured for them to use in escaping. They tie Humperdinck to a chair and jump to safety through the window. Having killed Rugen, Inigo is unsure what to do with his life and Westley offers him the Dread Pirate Roberts title. As dawn arises, Westley and Buttercup realize they are safe and share a passionate kiss.\n\nBack in his bedroom, the boy eagerly asks his grandfather to read him the story again the next day, to which his grandfather replies, \"As you wish.\u201d\n\n==Cast==\n\n===Framing story===\n* [[Fred Savage]] as The Grandson\n* [[Peter Falk]] as Grandpa/The Narrator\n* [[Betsy Brantley]] as The Mother\n\n===Main story===\n* [[Cary Elwes]] as Westley/[[Dread Pirate Roberts]]/The Man in Black\n* [[Robin Wright]] as Buttercup/The Princess Bride\n* [[Mandy Patinkin]] as [[Inigo Montoya]]\n* [[Chris Sarandon]] as Prince Humperdinck\n* [[Christopher Guest]] as Count Tyrone Rugen\n* [[Wallace Shawn]] as Vizzini\n* [[Andr\u00e9 the Giant]] as Fezzik\n* [[Peter Cook]] as The Impressive Clergyman\n* [[Mel Smith]] as The Albino\n* [[Carol Kane]] as Valerie, Max's wife\n* [[Billy Crystal]] as Miracle Max\n* [[Margery Mason]] as The Ancient Booer\n* [[Malcolm Storry]] as Yellin\n* [[Willoughby Gray]] as The King\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nRob Reiner, who had been enamored with Goldman's book ever since he was given it as a gift from his father, [[Carl Reiner]], realized he wanted to make the film adaptation after successfully demonstrating his filmmaking skill with the release of ''[[This Is Spinal Tap]]'' in 1984.<ref name=\"variety 30th\">{{Cite web |last=King |first=Susan |date=September 24, 2017 |title='The Princess Bride' Turns 30: Rob Reiner, Robin Wright, Billy Crystal Dish About Making the Cult Classic |url=https://variety.com/2017/film/features/the-princess-bride-turns-30-1202565060/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171230114650/http://variety.com/2017/film/features/the-princess-bride-turns-30-1202565060/ |archive-date=December 30, 2017 |access-date=December 29, 2017 |website=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]}}</ref> During production of ''[[Stand by Me (film)|Stand by Me]]'', released in 1986, Reiner had spoken to an executive at [[Paramount Pictures]] regarding what his next film would be, and suggested the adaptation of ''The Princess Bride''.

However, by the time ''The Princess Bride'' was finally green-lit, Schwarzenegger was a major film star and the studio could not afford him.
