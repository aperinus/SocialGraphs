It was directed by [[Antoine Fuqua]]. The film was a huge financial failure, costing [[Warner Bros.]] $51 million but only grossing approximately $15 million.\n\n==Plot==\nWhen fast talking, petty thief and hustler Alvin Sanders gets arrested for stealing prawns, the worst of his problems would seem to be going to jail. Unfortunately, he ends up sharing a cell with John Delano Jaster, a guy who, while stealing $42 million in gold from the Federal Reserve, double-crossed his partner, Bristol, after he murdered two bound and gagged guards during the gold heist. Bristol, who is the mastermind of the heist, is shown to be a dangerous man, with a knack for computers, a long memory, and who will go to any lengths to find where Jaster hid the gold, including killing others. While being interrogated by hardball Treasury Agent Edgar Clenteen, the double-crosser dies from heart failure. All the feds have are an incomprehensible message that Jaster gave to Alvin to deliver to his wife, who is unbeknownst to him, dead, having been killed by Bristol (\"Tell her she should go to the Bronx Zoo. Tell her '[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|There's no place like home]]'.\"), so they decide to release him and use him as bait to catch Bristol by secretly implanting a combination tracking device and electronic bug into Alvin's jaw. From that moment on, a surveillance team can follow Alvin's every move and hear his every word. Unfortunately, Alvin has a talent for getting into trouble especially with his criminal younger brother Stevie \u2014which means that the feds have to become his guardian angels so that he can serve his purpose. Sure enough, Bristol is hot on Alvin\u2019s trail, using his computer expertise to discover that Alvin was jailed alongside Jaster and managing to gain more information from him through a phony telephone call. Alvin soon becomes suspicious of the many situations that has occurred since he has been released from prison, especially when he encounters Bristol face to face, yet eventually Bristol kidnaps Alvin while evading the authorities, causing an explosion from a bomb attached to a bound and gagged agent Wooly. After interrogating Alvin, Bristol forces Alvin to lead him to the gold supposedly hidden at the horse track in Manhattan, while holding his girlfriend Lisa and baby hostage. Alvin manages to eventually escape and fight off Bristol and free Lisa before a bomb set in the van they\u2019re in explodes. Alvin manages to hot wire the van, drive it and jump out just in time before the bomb explodes. Bristol catches up to Alvin and points a gun at him, yet Clenteen shoots him multiple times, saving Alvin. A grateful Alvin, punches Clenteen due to earlier treatment while in jail, yet Clenteen, not upset by it, admits he had it coming.\n\nWhile discussing with Lisa concerning their son Gregory at her bookstore, Alvin meets a customer asking for the book, \"[[The Bronx Zoo (book)|The Bronx Zoo]]\", which leads him to understand Jaster's message; the gold is buried under \"home\" plate at Yankee Stadium. He then calls Clenteen to discuss a reward for the recovery of the stolen gold, which after some confusion turns out to be five percent of its value; two million dollars.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Jamie Foxx]] as Alvin Sanders\n* [[David Morse (actor)|David Morse]] as Treasury Agent Edgar Clenteen\n* [[Doug Hutchison]] as Bristol\n* [[Kimberly Elise]] as Lisa Hill\n* [[David Paymer]] as Treasury Agent Wooly\n* [[Mike Epps]] as Stevie Sanders\n* [[Robert Pastorelli]] as John Delano Jaster\n* [[Jamie Kennedy]] as Treasury Agent Blum\n* [[Nestor Serrano]] as Treasury Agent Boyle\n* [[Kirk Acevedo]] as Ramundo\n* [[Jeffrey Donovan]] as Julio\n* [[Megan Dodds]] as Treasury Agent Walsh\n* [[Tia Texada]] as Tika\n* [[Neil Crone]] as Supervisor\n\n==Production==\nIn May 1999, it was announced [[Jamie Foxx]] would star in the action-comedy ''Bait'' under the direction of [[Stephen Surjik]] who was eventually replaced by [[Antoine Fuqua]].<ref name=\"JamieFoxxBait\">{{cite news|url=https://variety.com/1999/film/news/castle-rock-will-use-jamie-foxx-as-bait-1117502087/|title=  Castle Rock will use Jamie Foxx as \u2018Bait\u2019 |publisher=Variety|access-date=September 29, 2021}}</ref> The film was co-produced by [[Castle Rock Entertainment]] and [[Village Roadshow Pictures]] with [[Warner Bros.]] distributing.<ref name=\"JamieFoxxBait\" /> Prior to casting [[David Morse (actor)|David Morse]] as Edgar Clenteen, the role had originally been slated to be played by [[Kris Kristofferson]].<ref name=\"KrisFoxxBait\">{{cite news|url=https://variety.com/1999/film/news/kris-and-foxx-to-play-cat-and-mouse-in-bait-1117744360/|title=  Kris and Foxx to play cat and mouse in \u2018Bait\u2019 |publisher=Variety|access-date=September 29, 2021}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\nOn [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film has an approval rating of 26%, based on reviews from 82 critics.
