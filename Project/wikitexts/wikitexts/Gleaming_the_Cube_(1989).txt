Among the skateboarders who appear in the film as stunt skaters are [[Mike McGill]], [[Mark Rogowski|Mark \"Gator\" Rogowski]], [[Rodney Mullen]], Rich Dunlop, Eric Dressen, [[Lance Mountain]], [[Mike Vallely]], Chris Black, Ted Ehr, [[Natas Kaupas]], Chris Borst, and Steve Saiz. [[Tony Hawk]] (Buddy) and [[Tommy Guerrero]] (Sam), then members of the [[Bones Brigade]], appear in the film as members of Brian's skate crew. [[Christian Jacobs]], future lead singer of [[The Aquabats]] and creator of ''[[Yo Gabba Gabba!]],'' also appears in the film as Gremic.\n\nThe film received a moderate release in the United States from [[20th Century Fox]] (in 469 theaters). Although the film had a relatively low box office turnout, it garnered a significant [[cult film|cult following]] after its theatrical release,<ref>{{cite web|title=Skateboarding out of the shadows|url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/bizchina/2009-06/22/content_8308648.htm|work=China Daily|publisher=China Daily Information Co (CDIC)|access-date=August 24, 2012|author=He Bolin|date=22 June 2009}}</ref> through basic cable replays on networks such as [[USA Network|USA]] and the burgeoning VHS (and later DVD) market, as well as among skateboarders.\n\nThe title of the film refers to the cryptic question \"Have you ever gleemed [sic] inside a cube?\" that Garry Scott Davis (GSD) asked Neil Blender in an interview in the December 1983 issue of ''[[Thrasher (magazine)|Thrasher]]'' magazine.<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Scott Davis|first=Gary|date=December 1983|title=Steep Slopes|url=http://www.thrashermagazine.com/articles/magazine/december-1983/|magazine=Thrasher|location=San Francisco, California|publisher=High Speed Productions Inc.|volume=3|issue=12|page=8|access-date=March 6, 2017}}</ref> In the film, Christian Slater's character defines \"gleaming the cube\" as \"pushing your limits to the edge\". The DVD contains an easter egg; by highlighting the skateboard on the main menu, viewers can watch a short featurette entitled \"What Does Gleaming the Cube Mean?\".\n\n==Plot==\nBrian Kelly is an underachieving high school student in Orange County, California. An avid skateboarder, Brian is frequently at odds with his parents for his increasingly reckless behavior, which has landed him in jail on more than one occasion. The only person in the family Brian can relate to is his adopted Vietnamese brother Vinh, who works as a shipping clerk for the Vietnamese Anti-Communist Relief Fund (VACRF), an organization which sends medical supplies to Vietnam.\n\nWhen Vinh discovers a suspicious inaccuracy in VACRF's shipping records, he brings it to his boss Colonel Trac, who fires Vinh when he tries to investigate. Undeterred, Vinh sneaks into Westpac Medical Supplies, the warehouse handling VACRF's shipping, but is apprehended by owner Ed Lawndale. Vinh is interrogated by Lawndale and Bobby Nguyen, another of Colonel Trac's employees, at a motel. When Colonel Trac arrives, it is revealed that he and Lawndale are conspirators in a scheme to smuggle illegal weapons to Vietnam. Convinced that Vinh poses no threat to their operation, Trac intends to set him free, but Vinh is accidentally strangled to death by Nguyen. They hang Vinh's body from a noose, so the police deem it a suicide.\n\nAfter the funeral, Brian finds the list of medical supplies Vinh was investigating, written in Vietnamese. Looking for someone to translate it, he encounters Bobby Nguyen who starts to follow him. Brian sneaks into the backseat of Nguyen\u2019s car and witnesses a meeting with Trac and Lawndale, in which Nguyen demands $50,000 and a ticket to Bangkok at gunpoint, but a struggle ensues and Lawndale kills Nguyen. Brian flees to notify the police, but they find no trace of the crime and later learn that Nguyen supposedly arrived in Thailand. Brian tries to convince Detective Al Lucero that his brother did not commit suicide. While skeptical, Lucero offers to look into it.\n\nSuspicious of Colonel Trac, Brian reaches out to Trac's daughter Tina, a fellow high school student and Vinh's ex-girlfriend. After an image makeover, Brian asks her out on a date and the two become closer. He attends one of VACRF's social functions, where he notices Lawndale and learns of his connection to Trac and Westpac. Following in his brother's footsteps, Brian sneaks into Lawndale's warehouse and uncovers a shipping crate full of weapons.\n\nBrian causes an explosion at the warehouse and plants evidence to incriminate Trac, but Lucero immediately suspects Brian and admonishes him for the act. However, the incident causes Trac to panic and send his wife and daughter away to his brother's house. A distressed Tina spends the night with Brian instead and discovers a lighter belonging to her father in Brian's room, leading Brian to explain all his suspicions to her. Tina angrily confronts her father about the conspiracy, who is shamed by his involvement and contacts Lawndale to end the operation. In response, Lawndale sends a group of Vietnamese motorcyclists to run Brian down on the street. The police manage to apprehend the bikers and, with the aid of an interpreter, Lucero is able to confirm Lawndale's role in the attack.\n\nBrian visits his friend Yabbo, who builds a newer, faster skateboard for Brian and rallies the rest of the skateboarding clique. Brian and the police both converge upon Colonel Trac's house, where Lawndale holds Tina at gunpoint. When Trac tries to wrestle the gun away, Brian crashes into the room through the window, but Lawndale shoots and kills Trac then escapes in a police car. Brian, Lucero, and the entire skateboarding crew eventually corner Lawndale. As Lawndale prepares to shoot Brian, he soars into the air on his skateboard and knocks Lawndale out; he is subsequently arrested by Lucero.\n\nBrian comforts Tina about her father's death and suggests that they return to school together, implying that their relationship will continue. Afterwards, Brian and Lucero visit Vinh's grave before driving away.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Christian Slater]] as Brian Kelly \n* [[Steven Bauer]] as Al Lucero\n* [[Richard Herd]] as Ed Lawndale\n* Le Tuan as Colonel Trac \n* Min Luong as Tina Trac\n* Art Chudabala as Vinh Kelly\n* [[Ed Lauter]] as Mr. Kelly\n* [[Micole Mercurio]] as Mrs. Kelly \n* Peter Kwong as Bobby Nguyen \n* [[Max Perlich]] as \"Yabbo\"\n* [[Tony Hawk]] as Buddy\n* [[Christian Jacobs]] as Gremic\n* Renowned [[stuntman]] [[Buddy Joe Hooker]] makes a [[cameo appearance|cameo]] at the start of the chase scene's freeway segment as the driver whose [[Chevrolet Corvette|Corvette]] gets sideswiped\n\n==Locations==\n* The [[Anaheim, California|Anaheim]] motel in the movie, the \"Atomic Age Lodge\", was in reality the Stovall's Cosmic Age Lodge on Katella Avenue, across the street from the then-Disneyland parking lot.
