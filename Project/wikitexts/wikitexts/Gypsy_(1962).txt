The [[screenplay]] by [[Leonard Spigelgass]] is based on the [[Libretto|book]] of the 1959 stage musical ''[[Gypsy (musical)|Gypsy: A Musical Fable]]'' by [[Arthur Laurents]], which was adapted from the 1957 autobiography ''[[Gypsy: A Memoir]]'' by [[Gypsy Rose Lee]]. [[Stephen Sondheim]] wrote the lyrics for songs composed by [[Jule Styne]]. The film was [[Gypsy (1993 film)|remade for television]] in 1993.\n\n==Plot==\nDetermined to make her beautiful, gifted daughter [[June Havoc|June]] a [[vaudeville]] headliner, willful, resourceful and domineering [[stage mother]] [[Rose Thompson Hovick|Rose Hovick]] will stop at nothing to achieve her goal. She drags June and her shy, awkward, and decidedly less-talented older sister [[Gypsy Rose Lee|Louise]] around the country in an effort to get them noticed, and with the help of agent Herbie Sommers, finally manages to secure a booking on the prestigious [[Orpheum Circuit, Inc.|Orpheum Circuit]].\n\nYears pass, and the girls no longer are young enough to pull off the childlike [[persona]]e their mother insists they continue projecting. June rebels, and elopes with Gerry, one of the dancers who backs their act. When the other dancers discover this, they also leave, presuming the act is finished. Devastated by what she sees as betrayal, Rose pours all her energy into making a success of Louise, despite her obvious lack of skill as a performer. Not helping matters is the increasing popularity of [[sound film]]s, which leads to a decline in the demand for stage entertainment. Herbie sticks with mother and daughter through their struggles, vainly hoping that Rose will one day quit show-business and settle down with him. With bookings scarce, they find themselves in [[Wichita, Kansas]], where a third-rate [[burlesque]] house books their act in hopes of keeping the [[vice squad]] at bay.\n\nRose appears to mature while at the burlesque house, deciding that this will be their last booking and suggesting that she and Herbie finally marry. However, when one of the strippers is arrested for shoplifting, Rose is unable to resist offering Louise as her replacement. Louise reluctantly agrees to go through with it, though it's clear she's only doing it to please her mother. This becomes the final straw for Herbie, as he is disgusted at the lengths Rose will go as a stage mother and realizes that she will never marry him. He offers her one chance to give him a reason to stay, and when she fails, he leaves her for good. At first, Louise's voice is shaky and her moves tentative, but she gains confidence as audiences respond to her, eventually blossoming as an entertainer billed as Gypsy Rose Lee. Exasperated by her mother's constant interference in both her life and wildly successful career, Louise finally confronts Rose and demands she leave her alone. Understanding that she has spent her life enslaved by a desperate need to be noticed and has driven everyone away, an angry, bitter, and bewildered Rose stumbles onstage at the deserted theatre and experiences an emotional breakdown. Realizing Louise witnessed this, Rose admits she tried to live vicariously through her and June, allowing her to reconcile with her daughter.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Rosalind Russell]] as Rose Hovick \n* [[Natalie Wood]] as Louise Hovick / Gypsy Rose Lee\n* [[Karl Malden]] as Herbie Sommers \n* Paul Wallace as Tulsa\n* [[Morgan Brittany|Morgan Brittany (billed as Suzanne Cupito)]] as Baby June \n* [[Ann Jillian]] as Dainty June / June Havoc\n* Diane Pace as Baby Louise \n* Betty Bruce as Tessie Tura\n* [[Faith Dane]] as Mazeppa \n* [[Roxanne Arlen]] as Electra\n* [[Harvey Korman]] as Gypsy's Press Agent (uncredited)\n* [[Jack Benny]] as Himself (uncredited)\n* [[Danny Lockin]] as Gerry (uncredited)\n* Bert Michaels as Yonkers (uncredited)\n\n==Musical numbers==\n{{div col|colwidth=25em}}\n# Overture \u2013 Orchestra, conducted by Jule Styne\n# \"Small World\" \u2013 Rose\n# \"Some People\" \u2013 Rose\n# \"Baby June and Her Newsboys\" \u2013 Baby June, Chorus\n# \"Mr. Goldstone, I Love You\" \u2013 Rose and chorus\n# \"Little Lamb\" \u2013 Louise\n# \"You'll Never Get Away From Me\" \u2013 Rose, Herbie\n# \"Dainty June and Her Farmboys\" \u2013 Dainty June, Chorus\n# \"If Mama Was Married\" \u2013 June, Louise\n# \"All I Need Is the Girl\" \u2013 Tulsa\n# \"[[Everything's Coming Up Roses]]\" \u2013 Rose\n# \"[[Together Wherever We Go]]\" \u2013 Rose, Herbie, Louise\n# \"[[You Gotta Get a Gimmick (song)|You Gotta Have a Gimmick]]\" \u2013 Tessie Tura, Mazeppa, Electra\n# \"Small World\" (Reprise) \u2013  Rose\n# \"[[Let Me Entertain You (Gypsy)|Let Me Entertain You]]\" \u2013 Louise\n# \"[[Rose's Turn]]\" \u2013 Rose\n{{div col end}}\n\n\"Together Wherever We Go\" was deleted prior to the film's release, although it was included on the [[soundtrack album]], and \"You'll Never Get Away From Me\" was abbreviated to a solo for Rose following the initial run. In the DVD release of the film, both numbers \u2013 taken from a 16-millimeter print of inferior quality \u2013 are included as bonus features.<ref>[http://www.dvd.net.au/review.cgi?review_id=2482 ''Gypsy'' at DVD.net.au]</ref>\n\n==Production==\n[[Rosalind Russell]] and her husband, [[theatre producer]] Frederick Brisson, were hoping to do a straight dramatic version of the story based directly on the memoir by [[Gypsy Rose Lee]], but the book was irrevocably tied up in the rights to the play. Coincidentally, Russell had just starred in the film version of the [[Leonard Spigelgass]] play ''[[A Majority of One]]'' at [[Warner Bros.]], which Brisson had produced, and all parties came together to make ''Gypsy'', with Russell starring, LeRoy directing, and Spigelgass writing the highly faithful adaptation of the [[Arthur Laurents]] stage book.\n\nAlthough Russell had starred and sung in the 1953 stage musical ''[[Wonderful Town]]'' and the 1955 film ''[[The Girl Rush]]'', the ''Gypsy'' score was beyond her. Her own gravelly singing voice was artfully blended with that of [[contralto]] [[Lisa Kirk]]. Kirk's ability to mimic Russell's voice is showcased in the final number \"Rose's Turn\", which is a clever blend of both of their voices. Kirk's full vocal version was released on the original soundtrack, although it is not the version used in the finished film. In later years, Russell's original tryout vocals were rediscovered on scratchy acetate discs and included as bonus tracks on the CD reissue of the film's soundtrack.<ref>[http://www.cduniverse.com/search/xx/music/pid/6386349/a/Gypsy.htm ''Gypsy'' at CDUniverse.com]</ref>\n\n[[Marni Nixon]] had dubbed [[Natalie Wood]]'s singing voice in ''[[West Side Story (1961 film)|West Side Story]]'' the previous year, but Wood did her own singing in ''Gypsy.'' While Wood recorded a separate version of \"Little Lamb\" for the soundtrack album, in the film she sang the song \"live\" on the set. Other songs performed live were \"Mr. Goldstone, I Love You\" and the reprise of \"Small World\", both sung by Russell (not Kirk).\n\n==Reaction==\n\n===Critical reception===\nFilm historian Douglas McVay observed in his book ''The Musical Film'', \"Fine as ''West Side Story'' is, though, it is equaled and, arguably, surpassed - in a rather different idiom - by another filmed Broadway hit: Mervyn LeRoy\u2019s ''Gypsy''. Arthur Laurents' book (for) ''West Side Story'' (adapted for the screen by Ernest Lehman), though largely craftsmanlike, falls short of his libretto for ''Gypsy'' (scripted on celluloid by Leonard Spigelgass), based on the memoirs of the transatlantic stripper Gypsy Rose Lee. The dialogue and situations in ''Gypsy'' have more wit, bite and emotional range, and the characterizations are more complex.\"<ref name=\"McVay\">{{cite book |last1=McVay |first1=Douglas| title=The Musical Film | year=1967 | publisher=Zwemmer |location=London | lccn=67022885}}</ref>\n\n''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' noted, \"There is a wonderfully funny sequence involving three nails-hard strippers which comes when ''Gypsy'' has been unreeling about an hour. The sequence is thoroughly welcome and almost desperately needed to counteract a certain Jane One-Note implicit in the tale of a stage mother whose egotisms become something of a bore despite the canny skills of director-producer Mervyn LeRoy to contrive it otherwise. Rosalind Russell's performance as the smalltime brood-hen deserves commendation ... It is interesting to watch [Natalie Wood] ... go through the motions in a burlesque world that is prettied up in soft-focus and a kind of phony innocence. Any resemblance of the art of strip, and its setting, to reality is, in this film, purely fleeting.\"<ref>[https://www.variety.com/review/VE1117791436.html?categoryid=31&cs=1 ''Variety'' review]</ref>\n\n===Box office performance===\n''Gypsy'' was a financial success.
