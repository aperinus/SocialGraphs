The storyline was conceived from a screenplay written by [[Charles Leavitt]] from a 1983 book ''Ernie Davis: The Elmira Express'', authored by Robert C. Gallagher. The film is based on the life of [[Syracuse University]] [[Syracuse Orange football|football]] player [[Ernie Davis]], the first [[African American]] to win the [[Heisman Trophy]], portrayed by actor [[Rob Brown (actor)|Rob Brown]]. ''The Express'' explores civil rights topics, such as racism, discrimination and athletics. It was the film debut of [[Chadwick Boseman]] as [[Floyd Little]].<ref name=\"film\">[[Gary Fleder]]. (2008). ''The Express'' [Motion picture]. United States: [[Universal Pictures]].</ref>\n\nThe film was a co-production between the film studios of [[Relativity Media]] and [[Davis Entertainment]]. It was commercially distributed by [[Universal Pictures]] theatrically, and by [[Universal Studios Home Entertainment]] for home media. [[Dennis Quaid]] and [[Charles S. Dutton]] star in principal supporting roles. The original motion picture soundtrack with a musical score composed by [[Mark Isham]], was released by the [[Lakeshore Records]] label on October 28, 2008.\n\n''The Express'' premiered in theaters nationwide in the United States on October 10, 2008. Despite receiving generally positive reviews from critics, the film was a [[box office bomb]], grossing just $9.8 million against its $40 million budget. The [[Blu-ray Disc|Blu-ray]] version of the film, featuring deleted scenes and the director's commentary was released on January 20, 2009.\n\n==Plot==\n[[Ernie Davis]] is a young African American growing up in Pennsylvania with his uncle Will Davis Jr. in the late 1940s. Davis lives with his extended family, including his grandfather, Willie 'Pops' Davis, who guides and educates him. Davis' mother, Marie Davis eventually returns to their residence to inform the family that she has remarried and can now afford to raise Ernie at her own home in [[Elmira, New York|Elmira]], [[New York (state)|New York]]. Upon relocating to Elmira, Davis enrolls in a Small Fry Football League and excels on the field as a running back.\n\nSeveral years later, Syracuse University football head coach [[Ben Schwartzwalder]] searches for a running back to address the absence of [[Jim Brown]], the graduating player completing his All-American senior season. Schwartzwalder is impressed with Davis after viewing footage of him playing for Elmira Free Academy and took his team to a state championship. Schwartzwalder convinces Brown to accompany him on a recruiting visit to see Davis and his family in hopes of luring him to commit to Syracuse. After their visit, Davis decides to enroll at Syracuse and spurns the recruiting efforts of other colleges.\n\nAt the start of the 1959 college football season, Davis immediately excels playing for the varsity team, to lead Syracuse to victories over several college football teams. After Syracuse defeats UCLA to conclude the regular season undefeated, the team decides by choice to play the 2nd ranked Texas Longhorns in the Cotton Bowl Classic. Before the game, university officials receive letters threatening attacks to Davis if he plays, but both Schwartzwalder and Davis defy the threats. During the game on January 1, 1960, Davis boldly attempts to lead his team to victory but is hampered by an injured leg and biased officiating. Towards the end of the game, Davis scores a crucial touchdown to preserve a Syracuse lead. The matchup concludes with a victory for Syracuse, and its first national championship. After the game, a banquet is held for the two teams, but when Davis is not allowed to attend, the rest of the Syracuse team leaves with him in a show of solidarity.\n\nIn 1961, Davis goes on to win the Heisman Trophy following his senior season in college. He later becomes a professional athlete in the [[National Football League]] and signs a contract with the [[Cleveland Browns]]. Later, however, following a series of health concerns, Davis is taken to a hospital to undergo medical testing. During a routine practice session, team owner [[Art Modell]] informs Davis he will be unable to play the upcoming season due to his condition. Subsequently, Davis holds a press conference and announces he has been diagnosed with leukemia. No longer able to play, Schwartzwalder asks Davis to accompany him on a recruiting trip, to talk to highly prized prospect [[Floyd Little]], who shows to be as much in awe of Davis as Davis had been earlier with Jim Brown. The Cleveland Browns honor Ernie by allowing him to suit up in uniform and join the team while running out before a televised game. Prior to the game, Schwartzwalder meets Davis and tells him that Little has decided to play at Syracuse.\n\nThe film's epilogue displays a series of graphics stating that Davis died on May 18, 1963 at the age of 23; while in condolence, President Kennedy expresses sympathy for Davis' fine character as a citizen and an athlete.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Rob Brown (actor)|Rob Brown]] as [[Ernie Davis]]\n*[[Dennis Quaid]] as [[Ben Schwartzwalder]] \n*[[Omar Benson Miller]] as Jack Buckley\n*[[Aunjanue Ellis]] as Marie Davis\n*[[Clancy Brown]] as Roy Simmons\n*[[Darrin Dewitt Henson]] as [[Jim Brown]]\n*[[Saul Rubinek]] as [[Art Modell]]\n*[[Nelsan Ellis]] as Will Davis, Jr. \n*[[Charles S.
