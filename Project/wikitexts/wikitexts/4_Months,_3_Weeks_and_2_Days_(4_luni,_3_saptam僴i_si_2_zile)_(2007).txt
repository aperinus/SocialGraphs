The film is set in [[Socialist Republic of Romania|Communist Romania]] in the final years of the [[Nicolae Ceau\u0219escu]] era. It tells the story of two students, roommates in a university dormitory, who try to procure an [[Abortion law|illegal abortion]]. Inspired by an anecdote from the period and the general social historic context, it depicts the loyalty of the two friends and the struggles they face.\n\nMungiu and cinematographer [[Oleg Mutu]] shot it in [[Bucharest]] and other Romanian locations in 2006. After making its world premiere at Cannes, ''4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days'' made its Romanian debut on 1 June 2007, at the [[Transilvania International Film Festival]]. It opened to critical acclaim, and was noted for its [[minimalism]] and intense themes.\n\nThe film won three awards at the [[2007 Cannes Film Festival]], including the [[Palme d'Or]]. It went on to win [[List of accolades received by 4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days|numerous honours]], including Best Film at the [[European Film Awards]] and Romania's national [[Gopo Awards]]. ''4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days'' became the subject of some controversy over censorship, the [[abortion debate]], and its exclusion from the [[80th Academy Awards]], but in 2016 it was ranked No. 15 on the BBC's list of [[BBC's 100 Greatest Films of the 21st Century|100 Greatest Films of the 21st Century]].\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1987, two university students in an unnamed [[Socialist Republic of Romania|Romanian]] town, Otilia Mih\u0103rtescu and Gabriela \"G\u0103bi\u021ba\" Dr\u0103gu\u021b, are roommates in a dormitory. When G\u0103bi\u021ba becomes pregnant, the two young women arrange a meeting with Mr. Bebe in a hotel, where he is to perform an [[abortion in Romania|illegal abortion]].  At the college dorm, G\u0103bi\u021ba and Otilia review the items they need for the day. As G\u0103bi\u021ba nervously sits and waits, Otilia [[black market|barters and buys]] soap and cigarettes from the dormitory shop. Afterwards, Otilia takes a bus to visit her boyfriend Adi, from whom she borrows money. Adi asks Otilia to visit his family that night, as it is his mother's birthday. Otilia initially declines, relenting after Adi becomes upset.\n\nOtilia heads to the Unirea hotel where G\u0103bi\u021ba has booked a room, only to be informed by an unfriendly receptionist that there is no reservation under G\u0103bi\u021ba's last name. Otilia visits another hotel, the Tineretului, and after much begging and haggling, is able to book a room at an expensive rate. After speaking with G\u0103bi\u021ba on the telephone, Otilia goes to a rendezvous point to meet with Bebe, although he had asked G\u0103bi\u021ba that she meet him personally. Mr. Bebe grows angry upon hearing that G\u0103bi\u021ba is not at the planned hotel.\n\nAt the Tineretului, Bebe discovers that G\u0103bi\u021ba's claim that her pregnancy was in its second or third month was a lie, and that it has been at least four months. This changes the procedure and also adds the risk of a murder charge.  While the two women were certain that they would pay no more than 3,000 [[Romanian leu|lei]] for the abortion, it slowly becomes clear that Bebe expects both women to have sex with him. Desperate and distressed, Otilia has sex with  Bebe, as does G\u0103bi\u021ba.  Bebe then performs the abortion by injecting a probe and an unnamed fluid into G\u0103bi\u021ba's uterus, and leaves Otilia instructions on how to dispose of the fetus when it comes out. Otilia is exasperated by G\u0103bi\u021ba's lies, yet continues to help and care for her.\n\nOtilia leaves G\u0103bi\u021ba at the Tineretului to attend Adi's mother's birthday party. She is still disturbed but stays and has dinner with Adi's mother's friends, who are mostly doctors. They converse about trivial matters while Otilia and Adi remain silent. After Otilia accepts a cigarette in front of Adi's parents, one of the guests starts talking about lost values and respect for elders. Adi and Otilia retreat to his room, where she tells him about G\u0103bi\u021ba's abortion. They begin debating what would happen if it were Otilia who was pregnant, as Adi is opposed to abortion. After the argument, Otilia calls G\u0103bi\u021ba from Adi's house. G\u0103bi\u021ba does not answer, so Otilia decides to return to the hotel.\n\nWhen Otilia enters the hotel room G\u0103bi\u021ba is lying on the bed, and she tells Otilia that the fetus has been expelled and is in the bathroom. Otilia wraps the fetus with some towels and puts it in a bag, while G\u0103bi\u021ba asks her to bury it. Otilia walks outside, finally climbing to the top of a building, as Mr. Bebe had suggested, and dropping the bag in a trash chute. She returns to the Tineretului and finds G\u0103bi\u021ba sitting in its restaurant. Otilia sits and tells G\u0103bi\u021ba that they are never going to talk about the episode again. Otilia stares blankly at G\u0103bi\u021ba.\n\n==Production==\n===Historical background===\n{{further|Decree 770}}\n[[File:Personality Cult Romania 1986.jpg|thumb|The film is based on [[Nicolae Ceau\u0219escu]]'s Romania of the 1980s.]]\n[[Romanian Communist Party General Secretary]] Nicolae Ceau\u0219escu enacted the abortion law Decree 770 in 1966 in order to increase the birth rates in the country.{{sfn|Nasta|2016|p=169}} The procedure was permitted in only extremely limited circumstances.{{sfn|Maierhofer|2017|p=161}} The law was not based on any religious opposition to abortion,{{sfn|Gradea|2016|p=110}} but on the government's authority and control over its citizens.<ref name=\"Porton35\">{{cite magazine |date=1 March 2008 |last=Porton |first=Richard |title=Not Just an Abortion Film: An Interview with Christian Mungiu |magazine=[[Cineaste (magazine)|Cineaste]] |page=35 }}</ref> Academic Adriana Cordali Gradea further argued justifications for the decree rendered a view of women as second-class citizens, with no right to be heard.{{sfn|Gradea|2016|p=110}} In the 1980s, the decree was strengthened to mandate gynecological appointments, to assess if individual women could reproduce.{{sfn|Strausz|2017|p=125}} Author Dominique Nasta judged the film to be an accurate portrait of the oppression, and on the poor state of the [[economy of the Socialist Republic of Romania]] in the later days of Ceau\u0219escu's regime.{{sfn|Nasta|2016|p=169}}\n\nDuring the years of Decree 770, the only available abortion methods, all illegal, could prove fatal to women, causing thousands of deaths.{{sfn|Deutscher|2017}} According to Mungiu's notes he shared with the press, the death toll was 500,000.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.laweekly.com/film/4-months-3-weeks-and-2-days-2151224 |title=4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days |last=Taylor |first=Ella |work=[[LA Weekly]] |date=19 December 2007 |access-date=7 September 2017 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170908114213/http://www.laweekly.com/film/4-months-3-weeks-and-2-days-2151224 |archive-date=8 September 2017}}</ref> Gradea cited a conservative 10,000 estimate.{{sfn|Gradea|2016|p=109}} Sanctions against contraception were also in place,{{sfn|Cardullo|2012|p=335}} and [[sex education]] was rare.{{sfn|Maierhofer|2017|p=161}} Following the [[Romanian Revolution|1989 Revolution]], abortion was made lawful, and subsequently unrestricted in the first 14 weeks.{{sfn|Maierhofer|2017|p=162}}\n\n===Development===\nThe initial idea for ''4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days'' was inspired by an anecdote from Communist Romania that director [[Cristian Mungiu]] had heard.<ref name=\"republik\">{{cite web |url=http://www.4months3weeksand2days.com/blog/2007/05/17/interview-republik/ |title=Interview with Cristian Mungiu |publisher=Official website |last=Sandu |first=Ana Maria, ''RE:PUBLIK'' |date=25 May 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070630011210/http://www.4months3weeksand2days.com/blog/2007/05/17/interview-republik |archive-date=30 June 2007 |language=ro |url-status=dead}}</ref> Though he had heard it from a friend 15 years prior to the film, the incident occurred five years before that, in 1987, a date that Mungiu noted in the screenplay.<ref name=\"Mungiu\">{{cite AV media |last=Mungiu |first=Cristian |date=2008 |title=Interview with the Director Cristian Mungiu |work=4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days |medium=DVD |publisher=[[Mongrel Media]]}}</ref> Mungiu, himself a decre\u021bel (born in the time of Decree 770),{{sfn|Nasta|2016|p=169}} wanted to create a serious film focusing on the true story, which still affected him and felt tragic more than 15 years later.<ref name=\"republik\"/> He conducted interviews with others who lived through the period, to determine if the experience was common.<ref name=\"Mungiu\"/> Aside from the anecdote, depicting the 1980s in Romania was appealing because he remembered the time, and \"The attraction is for the stories that I know from that period.

Jitaru specifically cited the dinner scene, where the conversation makes much of the divide between those with university degrees and those with none.{{sfn|Jitaru|2014|p=5}} The attendees boast about belonging to the middle class, and make denigrating comments about Otilia's rural origins.{{sfn|Strausz|2017|p=131}}\n\nThe term \"communism\" is never mentioned,{{sfn|Turcu\u0219|2017|p=230}} the existence of Decree 770 is only implied,{{sfn|Gradea|2016|p=109}} and president Nicolae Ceau\u0219escu is never named.<ref name=\"Smith\"/> Despite this, communism is a major subject.{{sfn|Godeanu-Kenworthy|Popescu-Sandu|2014|pp=225\u2013248}} Andreescu found that in many locations, one power is dominant; in some, the government, while in others, an underground power or [[Heterotopia (space)|Heterotopia]] forms.{{sfn|Andreescu|2013|p=116}} The hotel room where the abortion is performed becomes a location outside of the government's supervision. Mr. Bebe exploits this, boasts of the worth of his expertise and notes the risk he is taking, in order to extort the women for sex.{{sfn|Andreescu|2013|p=118}} Turcu\u0219 instead interpreted the scene as Mr. Bebe presenting himself as the \"new man\", sharing the women's legal peril and an openness to sexuality, while in fact being \"the communist brute\".{{sfn|Turcu\u0219|2017|p=231}} ''[[Jump Cut (journal)|Jump Cut]]'' writer Constantin Parvulescu stated \"''4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days'' provides an astute balance of [[Ostalgie|ostalgia]] and anti-communist memorial\".

This is seen at the end, where Otilia forbids further discussion of the abortion. The lack of a score can also be seen as contributing to a sense of pending danger.{{sfn|Gradea|2016|p=112}}\n\n[[File:\u00daltima Cena - Da Vinci 5.jpg|thumb|The dinner scene is accidentally reminiscent of the Last Supper.]]\nThe fact that the characters live in poverty is reflected in a scene where Mr. Bebe accosts his mother for wanting to buy sugar.{{sfn|Nasta|2016|p=169}} When Otilia is searching for Mr. Bebe, there is also a line of people visible in the background queuing for food, reflecting the lack of food security in the 1980s.{{sfn|Strausz|2017|pp=130-131}} Additionally, the characters are often impolite towards each other. Mungiu explained that this was related to the poverty, saying \"You need people in a society to have reached a certain standard of living before they can be polite\".<ref name=\"Decade\"/> The bartering scenes reflect how corporate goods common west of the [[Iron Curtain]] were prohibited in Romania and were viewed as luxuries.{{sfn|Jitaru|2014|p=6}}\n\nThe dinner scene is reminiscent of the [[Last Supper]].
