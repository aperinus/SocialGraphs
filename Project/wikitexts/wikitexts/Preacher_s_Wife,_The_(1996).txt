Vance]]. It is a [[remake]] of the 1947 film ''[[The Bishop's Wife]]'',<ref>{{cite news |author=Patrick Goldstein |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1996-12-11/entertainment/ca-7763_1_african-american-films |title=Praying for Crossover Appeal |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=December 11, 1996 |access-date=August 7, 2012}}</ref> which in turn was based on the novel of the same name by [[Robert Nathan]].\n\nIt was nominated for the [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] for [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Best Music, Original Musical or Comedy Score]]. The film was nominated for five [[Image Award]]s, including Outstanding Motion Picture, and won two\u2014for Best Actress (Whitney Houston) and Best Supporting Actress (Loretta Devine).\n\n==Plot==\nA voiceover by the child Jeremiah guides the viewer through the film.\n\nReverend Henry Biggs is the [[pastor]] of a small struggling [[African Americans|African American]] [[Baptist]] church in a poverty-stricken neighborhood of New York City. Membership is declining, Henry is pulled in a hundred directions by his parishioners' needs, and the church's finances are in trouble. Henry is under intense pressure from real estate developer Joe Hamilton to sell the church's property so that Hamilton can build luxury condominiums on the site. Henry has also become neglectful of his wife Julia and his son Jeremiah. Julia worries that her marriage is failing. Unsure that he can make a difference in his parishioners' lives and beginning to lose his faith, Henry prays to God for help, which comes in the form of Dudley, a witty and debonair [[angel]]. Dudley tells Henry that he is an angel sent by God to help him, but Henry is deeply suspicious of Dudley. Julia, however, is instantly charmed by the handsome and unflappable angel.\n\nWith Christmas approaching, Henry's schedule becomes increasingly burdensome, and Dudley begins to spend most of his time with Julia and Jeremiah. Henry's secretary Beverly becomes comically defensive and aggressive, believing Dudley is there to take her job. Julia's wasp-tongued mother, Margueritte is also suspicious of Dudley, because she believes the newcomer will break up her daughter's marriage. Dudley and Julia go ice skating, and then later spend an evening in the jazz club where Julia once performed. After Henry confronts Dudley, Dudley realizes that he is falling in love with Julia. So, Dudley turns his attention to Hamilton and manages to disrupt his schemes to get Henry to sell the church. Henry now realizes that his family is the most important thing in his life, and he resolves to be a better husband and father. At the church's Christmas pageant, Henry finds his faith in God renewed and ties to his family restored.\n\nWith his work done, Dudley gives the Biggs family a fully decorated [[Christmas tree]] as a gift. Dudley then erases all memories of himself from everyone he has met, and although he attends morning service on [[Christmas Eve]], no one recognizes him. However, Jeremiah, who has the faith of a child, still remembers Dudley, and wishes him a merry Christmas.\n\nA subplot present throughout the film focuses on Julia's singing talents. Once a popular nightclub singer, she is now a star in the church [[choir]]. This subplot provides for several [[set piece (film)|set piece]]s in which the choir performs, and [[Gospel music]] plays a significant role. It also provides comic relief in the form of a domineering choir member, played by Houston's real life mother, Cissy.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Whitney Houston]] as Julia Biggs\n* [[Denzel Washington]] as Dudley\n* [[Courtney B.

''Philadelphia Inquirer''. December 15, 1996.</ref> The screenplay was written by Nat Mauldin and Allan Scott. Credits are given to [[Robert E. Sherwood]] and Leonardo Bercovici for the 1947 film ''The Bishop's Wife'', and to author Robert Nathan (for his novel ''The Bishop's Wife'').\n\nThe role of Julia was written with Whitney Houston in mind. Denzel Washington says that he first considered [[Julia Roberts]] for the role, but quickly turned to Whitney Houston.<ref name=\"JohnHall\" /> Houston admitted that she was reluctant to accept, feeling she could not do justice to a role that required her to play a dowdy [[homemaker|housewife]]. Only after reading the script a second time and seeing parallels between her own life and the role of Julia did Houston accept.<ref>Lawson, Terry. \"Whitney Houston Says She Was Reluctant to Star in 'The Preacher's Wife'\". ''Detroit Free Press''. December 20, 1996.</ref> Houston was paid $10 million to appear in the film, making her the highest paid black actress at the time.<ref name=\"JohnHall\" />\n\n''The Preacher's Wife'' was the third film produced by Washington's company ''[https://opencorporates.com/companies/us_ca/C1687017 Mundy Lane Entertainment.]'' For Washington, the movie was a meaningful project due to its message about the value of family, community, and faith. Moreover, as Washington reflected to ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' magazine, the film provided opportunities for those underrepresented in show business:<blockquote>\"I\u2019m happy to know that on a film like \u2018Devil in a Blue Dress\u2019 we put 100 or so many black people to work, and it was the same with \u2018The Preacher\u2019s Wife,\u2019 [Washington] said. \u201cAnd it will be the same thing with other films that I\u2019m involved in, whether I\u2019m on a producer level or not. We do it because they\u2019re capable and because nobody else is necessarily looking out for them,\u201d he says of African-American talent.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Laski |first=Beth |date=March 5, 1997 |title=Mundy Lane Sees a Full Load Ahead |work=Variety |url=https://variety.com/1997/scene/vpage/mundy-lane-sees-a-full-load-ahead-1117343128/ |access-date=April 29, 2022}}</ref></blockquote>Filming began in early January 1996. Trinity United Methodist Church in [[Newark, New Jersey]], served as the Biggs' New York City church.<ref name=\"JohnHall\" /> The production leased the church, and began renovating it in February 1996. The interior was painted, new carpet laid, and the main doors repaired. The production team designed a pulpit and [[altar rails]] that more accurately reflected the design of Baptist churches. After filming, the church kept the pulpit, and the production crew worked with architects from the [[United Methodist Church]] to design and install rails more fitting of the Methodist style. Filming occurred there from March 11 to April 3, with about a quarter of the church's membership hired as extras. (The church used the rental fees paid by the production to replace its boiler and [[HVAC]] system.)<ref>McGlone, Peggy. \"Divine Hosts, Generous Guests\". ''Newark Star-Ledger''. December 13, 1996.</ref>\n\nProduction was plagued by poor weather and accidents. Interior sets were constructed at [[Chelsea Piers]], a film and television production facility in [[Manhattan, New York]].<ref name=\"Staudter\" /> Severe snowstorms in New Jersey (where scenes were shot in [[Paterson, New Jersey|Paterson]]<ref name=\"Staudter\" />) and New York (where scenes were shot throughout New York City) cost the production several shooting days. Later, the cast and crew moved to [[Portland, Maine]], to scenes which occur at an ice skating rink, but unseasonably warm weather turned the ice to water and forced the production to rent snow-making machines. The production filmed in several crime-ridden areas of New York City to achieve authenticity. Robberies were common in the area, leaving the cast and crew nervous. While filming exteriors and interiors at a church and [[parsonage]] in [[Yonkers, New York]], a building a block away caught fire and two children died.<ref name=\"Strife\">[http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20569554_295424,00.html Ascher-Walsh, Rebecca. \"Preacher's Strife\".

The weekend before filming began at the church, an elderly parishioner fell, broke her hip and died. In the middle of filming, a crew member was struck by a car and killed. The production schedule was also impacted by Houston's decision only to shoot scenes with vocal performances during the afternoon.<ref name=\"Strife\" />\n\nFilming was scheduled to wrap at the end of February, but the crew was still shooting at the beginning of May.

He singled out Penny Marshall's directing for being \"consistently wise and judicious\", and praised Jenifer Lewis and Loretta Devine.<ref name=\"Thomas\">[http://articles.latimes.com/1996-12-13/entertainment/ca-8504_1_henry-biggs Thomas, Kevin. \"A Heavenly Persuasion\".

This movie could have done more, but what it does, it makes you feel good about.\"<ref>[http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19961213/REVIEWS/612130303/1023 Ebert, Roger. \"The Preacher's Wife\".

Although he found it heart-warming, he wrote that it had a \"patchy narrative\" and felt the film made Washington and Houston such great characters that it was hard to see why the Biggs' marriage should survive. Too often, he concluded, the plot seemed nothing more than a means of stringing together terrific musical performances by Houston and the [[Georgia Mass Choir]]. Byrge found Penny Marshall's directing slow at times but felt that casting director Paula Herold had done wonders. He singled out Courtney B. Vance as an appealing if downbeat husband, Jenifer Lewis as the \"sassy\" mother-in-law, and Loretta Devine as Bigg's defensive, aggressive secretary who thinks Dudley is there to replace her. Marshall, Byrge said, was more effective directing these lively characters (and actors) than the film's stars.<ref>Byrge, Duane. \"Movie Review: 'The Preacher's Wife'\". ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]''. December 9, 1996.</ref>\n\nIn contrast, Caren Weiner Campbell, writing for ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'', found Denzel Washington to be lackluster (though the gospel singing scenes were quite good). Her strongest criticism was directed at the screenplay. She felt the script had too many subplots, with the narrative by the character of Jeremiah was \"sappy\", and was lacking in the \"fun miracles\" of the original. She also criticized Marshall's directing for being slow and tedious.<ref>[http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20569554_274918,00.html Campbell, Caren Weiner. \"'The Preacher's Wife' Review\".

She found Courtney B. Vance's acting humorless, and was highly critical of Whitney Houston's acting. \"[Houston] sleepwalks through scenes as the dignified mother, doing little more than tucking her 6-year-old son (Justin Pierre Edmund) in. It's not a showy role, but Houston plays it as if the frost outdoors has settled on her shoulders\". While she had high praise for Denzel Washington (he \"plays Dudley with a 100-watt smile and childlike sense of wonder\"), she had little to say for Penny Marshall's directing. It was, she concluded, slow and the overall tone of the film \"strangely solemn\"\u2014with only minor relief given by Jenifer Lewis' biting, scathingly funny turn as a tart-tongued mother.<ref>Potts, Jackie. \"'The Preacher's Wife' Could Use A Prayer\".
