Upon initial release, it did not immediately gain international recognition and was considered \"too Japanese\" to be marketable by Japanese film exporters. It was screened in 1957 in London, where it won the inaugural [[Sutherland Trophy]] the following year, and received praise from U.S. film critics after a 1972 screening in New York City.\n\n''Tokyo Story'' is widely regarded as Ozu's masterpiece and today as [[List of films considered the best|one of the greatest films in history of cinema]]. In 2012, it was voted the greatest film of all time in a poll of film directors by ''[[Sight & Sound]]'' magazine.\n\n==Plot==\nRetired couple Sh\u016bkichi and Tomi Hirayama live in [[Onomichi, Hiroshima|Onomichi]] in western Japan with their daughter Ky\u014dko, a primary school teacher. They have four adult children, three of whom are living. The couple travel to [[Tokyo]] to visit their son, daughter, and widowed daughter-in-law.\n\nTheir eldest son, K\u014dichi, is a [[Internal medicine|physician]] who runs a small clinic in Tokyo's suburbs, and their eldest daughter, Shige, runs a hairdressing salon. K\u014dichi and Shige are both busy and do not have much time for their parents. Only their widowed daughter-in-law, Noriko, the wife of their middle son Sh\u014dji, who was missing in action and presumed dead during the [[Pacific War]], goes out of her way to entertain them. She takes time from her busy office job to take Sh\u016bkichi and Tomi on a sightseeing tour of metropolitan Tokyo.\n\nFeeling conflicted that they don't have time to entertain them, K\u014dichi and Shige pay for their parents to stay at a [[onsen|hot spring spa]] at [[Atami]] but they return early because the nightlife there disturbs their sleep. Tomi also has an unexplained dizzy spell. Upon returning, a frustrated Shige explains that she sent them to Atami because she wanted to use their bedroom for a meeting; the elderly couple has to leave for the evening. Tomi goes to stay with Noriko, with whom she deepens their emotional bond, and advises her to remarry. Sh\u016bkichi, meanwhile, gets drunk with some old friends from Onomichi. The three men drunkenly ramble about their children and lives. A policeman brings Sh\u016bkichi and one of his friends to Shige's salon. Shige is outraged that her father is lapsing into the alcoholic ways that overshadowed her childhood.\n\nThe couple remarks on how their children have changed, returning home earlier than planned, intending to see their younger son Keiz\u014d when the train stops in [[Osaka]]. However, Tomi suddenly becomes ill during the journey and they decide to disembark the train, staying until she feels better the next day. They return to Onomichi, and Tomi falls critically ill. K\u014dichi, Shige, and Noriko rush to Onomichi to see Tomi, who dies shortly afterwards. Keiz\u014d arrives too late, as he has been away on business.\n\nAfter the funeral, K\u014dichi, Shige, and Keiz\u014d leave immediately; only Noriko remains. After they leave, Ky\u014dko criticises her siblings over their selfishness toward their parents. She believes that K\u014dichi, Shige, and Keiz\u014d do not care how hard it will be for their father now that he has lost their mother. She is also upset at Shige for asking so quickly for Tomi's clothes as keepsakes. Noriko responds that while she understands Ky\u014dko's disappointment, everyone has their own life and the growing chasm between parents and children is inevitable. She convinces Ky\u014dko not to be too hard on her siblings because one day she will understand how hard it is to take time away from one's own life.\n\nAfter Ky\u014dko leaves for school, Noriko informs her father-in-law that she must return to Tokyo that afternoon. Sh\u016bkichi tells her that she has treated them better than their own children despite not being a blood relation. Noriko protests that she is selfish and has not always thought about her missing husband, and Sh\u016bkichi credits her self-assessment to humility. He gives her a watch from the late Tomi as a memento. Noriko cries and confesses her loneliness; Sh\u016bkichi encourages her to remarry as soon as possible, wanting her to be happy. Noriko travels from Onomichi back to Tokyo, contemplating the watch, while Sh\u016bkichi remains behind, resigned to the solitude he must endure.\n\n===Hirayama family tree===\n[[File:So Yamamura 3.jpg|thumb|250 px|right|From left to right: K\u014dichi ([[So Yamamura]]), Fumiko ([[Kuniko Miyake]]), Sh\u016bkichi ([[Chish\u016b Ry\u016b]]), Noriko ([[Setsuko Hara]]), Shige ([[Haruko Sugimura]]) and Tomi ([[Chieko Higashiyama]]).]]\n{{chart/start|align=center}}\n{{chart| | | | | |GF   |y|GM   | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |GF =Sh\u016bkichi<br /><small>(husband)</small> |GM =Tomi<br /><small>(wife)</small>\n|boxstyle_GF = background-color: #9cf;\n|boxstyle_GM = background-color: pink;}}\n{{chart| | |,|-|-|-|-|-|^|-|-|-|-|-|v|-|-|-|v|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|v|-|-|-|.| | |}}\n{{chart| |O1   |y|S1   | |S2   |~|O2   | |O3   |~|S3   | |O4   | |O5   | O1=K\u014dichi<br /><small>(eldest son)</small> |O2=Shige Kaneko<br /><small>(eldest daughter)</small> |O3=Sh\u014dji<br /><small>(second son)<br />deceased</small> |O4=Keiz\u014d<br /><small>(youngest son)</small> |O5=Ky\u014dko<br /><small>(youngest daughter)</small> |S1=Fumiko<br /><small>(daughter-in-law)</small> |S2=Kuraz\u014d Kaneko<br /><small>(son-in-law)</small> |S3=Noriko<br /><small>(daughter-in-law)</small>\n|boxstyle_O1 = background-color: #9cf;\n|boxstyle_O2 = background-color: pink;\n|boxstyle_O3 = background-color: #9cf;\n|boxstyle_O4 = background-color: #9cf;\n|boxstyle_O5 = background-color: pink;\n|boxstyle_S1 = background-color: pink;\n|boxstyle_S2 = background-color: #9cf;\n|boxstyle_S3 = background-color: pink;}}\n{{chart| | |,|-|^|-|.| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |}}\n{{chart| |GS1  | |GS2  | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |GS1=Minoru<br /><small>(grandson)</small>|GS2=Isamu<br /><small>(grandson)</small>\n|boxstyle_GS1 = background-color: #9cf;\n|boxstyle_GS2 = background-color: #9cf;}}\n{{chart| |}}\n{{chart/end}}\n\n==Cast==\n{{col-begin}}{{col-break}}\n* [[Chish\u016b Ry\u016b]] as {{nihongo4|Sh\u016bkichi Hirayama|\u5e73\u5c71 \u5468\u5409|Hirayama Shukichi}}\n* [[Chieko Higashiyama]] as {{nihongo4|Tomi Hirayama|\u5e73\u5c71 \u3068\u307f|Hirayama Tomi}}\n* [[Setsuko Hara]] as {{nihongo4|Noriko Hirayama|\u5e73\u5c71 \u7d00\u5b50|Hirayama Noriko}}\n* [[Haruko Sugimura]] as {{nihongo4|Shige Kaneko|\u91d1\u5b50 \u5fd7\u3052|Kaneko Shige}}\n* [[So Yamamura]] as {{nihongo4|K\u014dichi Hirayama|\u5e73\u5c71 \u5e78\u4e00|Hirayama Koichi}}\n* [[Kuniko Miyake]] as {{nihongo4|Fumiko Hirayama|\u5e73\u5c71 \u6587\u5b50|Hirayama Fumiko}}\n* [[Ky\u014dko Kagawa]] as {{nihongo4|Ky\u014dko Hirayama|\u5e73\u5c71 \u4eac\u5b50|Hirayama Kyoko}}\n* [[Eijir\u014d T\u014dno]] as {{nihongo4|Sanpei Numata|\u6cbc\u7530 \u4e09\u5e73|Numata Sanpei}}\n* [[Nobuo Nakamura]] as {{nihongo4|Kuraz\u014d Kaneko|\u91d1\u5b50 \u5eab\u9020|Kaneko Kurazo}}\n* Shir\u014d \u014csaka as {{nihongo4|Keiz\u014d Hirayama|\u5e73\u5c71 \u656c\u4e09|Hirayama Keizo}}\n* Hisao Toake as {{nihongo4|Osamu Hattori|\u670d\u90e8 \u4fee|Hattori Osamu}}\n* Teruko Nagaoka as {{nihongo4|Yone Hattori|\u670d\u90e8 \u3088\u306d|Hattori Yone}}\n* [[Mutsuko Sakura]] as a patron of the Oden Restaurant\n* Toyo Takahashi as Sh\u016bkichi Hirayama's neighbour\n* T\u014dru Abe as a railway employee\n{{col-break|gap=4em}}\n* Sachiko Mitani as Noriko's neighbour\n* Zen Murase as Minoru Hirayama, K\u014dichi's son\n* Mitsuhiro Mori as Isamu Hirayama, K\u014dichi's son\n* Junko Anami as a beauty salon assistant\n* Ry\u014dko Mizuki as a beauty salon client\n* Yoshiko Togawa as a beauty salon client\n* Kazuhiro Itokawa as a student\n* Keijir\u014d Morozumi as a police agent\n* Tsutomu Nijima as Noriko's office boss\n* Sh\u014dz\u014d Suzuki as Noriko's office colleague\n* Yoshiko Tashiro as a hotel maid\n* Haruko Chichibu as a hotel maid\n* Takashi Miki as a singer\n* Binnosuke Nagao as the doctor at Onomichi\n{{col-end}}\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Setsuko Hara and Yasujiro Ozu in Tokyo Story.jpg|thumb|175 px|right|Ozu (far right) on set during shooting.]]\n''Tokyo Story'' was inspired by the 1937 American film ''[[Make Way for Tomorrow]]'', directed by [[Leo McCarey]]. Noda initially suggested the plot of the older film to Ozu, who hadn't seen it.

Shooting and editing the film took place from July to October 1953. Filming locations were in [[Tokyo]] ([[Adachi, Tokyo|Adachi]], [[Ch\u016b\u014d, Tokyo|Ch\u016b\u014d]], [[Tait\u014d]] and [[Chiyoda, Tokyo|Chiyoda]]), [[Onomichi, Hiroshima|Onomichi]], [[Atami, Shizuoka|Atami]] and [[Osaka]]. Among the major cast members only Ry\u016b, Hara and Kagawa participated in the Onomichi location. All indoor scenes, except those at the [[Tokyo Station]] waiting area and in a [[Passenger car (rail)|passenger car]], were shot at the Shochiku \u014cfuna Studio in [[Kamakura]], Kanagawa. Ozu used the same film crew and actors he had worked with for many years.{{sfn|Desser|1997|pp=20-21}}{{sfn|Eleftheriotis|Needham|2006|pp=17\u201326}} Actor [[Chish\u016b Ry\u016b]] said that Ozu was always happiest when finishing the final draft of a script and that there were never any changes to the final draft.{{sfn|Desser|1997|p=152}}\n\n==Style and themes==\nLike all of Ozu's sound films, ''Tokyo Story'''s pacing is slow.{{sfn|Bordwell|Thompson|2003|p=[https://archive.org/details/filmhistoryintro00thom_325/page/n429 396]}} Important events are often not shown on screen but revealed through dialogue.

The audience never sees Sh\u016bkichi and Tomi visit their son Keiz\u014d, and Tomi's illness begins off-screen.{{sfn|Desser|1997|pp=6-7}}\n\nThemes in the film include the break-up and [[Westernization]] of the traditional Japanese family after [[World War II]] and the inevitability of children growing apart from their parents.{{sfn|Desser|1997|p=4}} The film takes place in 1953 post-war Japan, a few years after the new Civil Code of 1948 stimulated the country's rapid re-growth and embraced Western capitalist ideals while simultaneously destroying older traditions such as the Japanese family and its values.{{sfn|Desser|1997|pp=30-31}} Ozu was very close to his own mother, living with her as a surrogate wife and never marrying.{{sfn|Desser|1997|p=95}} Ozu called ''Tokyo Story'' \"the film that tends most strongly to melodrama.\"{{sfn|Desser|1997|p=122}} It is considered a [[Shomin-geki]] film for its depiction of working-class people.{{sfn|Desser|1997|p=26}}\n\n==Release and reception==\n''Tokyo Story'' was released on November 3, 1953, in Japan.
