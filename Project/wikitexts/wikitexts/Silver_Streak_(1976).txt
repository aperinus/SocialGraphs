While sharing nightcaps in Hilly's sleeper car, George sees Schreiner's body fall from the train outside her window. Investigating Schreiner's train compartment, George encounters Johnson, Whiney, and Reace, toughs who have ransacked Schreiner's belongings. Reace throws George off the train. After walking along the tracks, George meets a farmer and they overtake the train in her biplane.\n\nGeorge sees Hilly with art dealer Roger Devereau and his employees Johnson (impersonating Schreiner), and Whiney. Devereau apologizes to George for the misunderstanding involving Reace, also under his employ. Sweet reveals himself to be an undercover [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] agent named Stevens. The bureau has been investigating Devereau, a criminal who passes himself off as an art expert. Devereau's plan is to discredit Schreiner's book, which would expose Devereau for authenticating forgeries as original Rembrandts. Inside Schreiner's book, George finds letters written by Rembrandt that would prove Devereau's guilt. Reace kills Stevens, thinking he is George. A fight ends on the roof of the train, where George shoots Reace before being knocked off by a train signal.\n\nOn foot again, George finds the local sheriff who has trouble making sense of his story. The sheriff says the police are after George for killing Stevens. George escapes, stealing a patrol car that had been transporting car thief Grover T. Muldoon. George and Grover work together to catch up to the train at Kansas City, so George can save Hilly from Devereau's crew. Grover disguises George as a black man so George can get by police to board the train.\n\nGeorge is captured, but he and Hilly are rescued from Devereau's room by Grover, disguised as a steward. After a shootout, George and Grover jump off the train and are arrested. They meet federal agent Donaldson, former partner to Stevens, who tells George and Grover the police knew all along George didn't kill Stevens - they were only trying to protect George from Devereau. Donaldson made up the news story about Stevens' murder. After George explains Devereau's plan, Donaldson has the train stopped. Devereau burns the Rembrandt letters.\n\nGeorge boards with Grover as Devereau climbs onto the locomotive and shoots the fireman. Whiney is wounded by Donaldson and kicked off the train by Devereau. George shoots Johnson and Devereau shoots the engineer, placing a toolbox on the switch to keep the engine running. Devereau is disabled by shots from George and Donaldson, and is decapitated by an oncoming freight train.\n\nWith the help of a porter, George uncouples the runaway engine from the passenger cars. The engine roars into Chicago's Central Station, destroying everything in its path. The passenger cars follow, gliding safely into the station. Grover steals a [[Fiat X1/9]] and drives away. George and Hilly leave together.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Gene Wilder]] as George Caldwell\n* [[Jill Clayburgh]] as Hildegarde \"Hilly\" Burns\n* [[Richard Pryor]] as Grover T.

He wrote ''Silver Streak'' \"because I had always wanted to get on a train and meet some blonde.

It was set on an [[Amtrak]] train and [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]] was interested, but wanted Amtrak to give its approval. [[Alan Ladd Jr.]] and Frank Yablans at [[20th Century Fox]] didn't want to wait and bought the script for a then-record $400,000. Ladd said \"It was like the old [[Laurel and Hardy]] comedies. The hero is Laurel, he falls off the train, stumbles about, makes a fool of himself, but still gets the pretty girl. Audiences have identified with that since [[Buster Keaton]].\"<ref name=\"ladd\"/>\n\nColin Higgins wanted [[George Segal]] for the hero \u2013 the character's name is George \u2013 but Fox preferred Gene Wilder.
