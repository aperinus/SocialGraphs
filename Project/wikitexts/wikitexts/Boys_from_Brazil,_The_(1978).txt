Schaffner]]. It stars [[Gregory Peck]] and [[Laurence Olivier]], and features [[James Mason]], [[Lilli Palmer]], [[Uta Hagen]], [[Anne Meara]], [[Denholm Elliott]], and [[Steve Guttenberg]] in supporting roles. The film is a British-American co-production and is based on the [[The Boys from Brazil (novel)|1976 novel of the same title]] by [[Ira Levin]]. It was nominated for three [[Academy Awards]].\n\n==Plot==\nEzra Lieberman, an aging [[Nazi hunter]], learns of a secret organization of [[Nazi Germany|Third Reich]] [[war criminal]]s and [[neo-Nazi]]s holding clandestine meetings in [[Paraguay]]. Dr. [[Josef Mengele]], the infamous [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz]] doctor, is part of the organization. He leads a mysterious project to assassinate ninety-four aging, low-level, male [[civil servant]]s in different countries throughout the world.\n\nUpon investigating several suspicious deaths of civil servants, Lieberman is amazed to find that the adopted sons of the dead men, now teenagers, share an uncanny resemblance, including blue eyes and black hair. It transpires that, using samples of [[Adolf Hitler|Adolf Hitler's]] [[DNA]], Mengele has sent ninety-four [[Human cloning|cloned babies]] to different parts of the world for [[adoption]], in the hopes that one or more will turn out like the original Hitler and initiate a [[Fourth Reich]]. With each baby, Mengele has attempted to recreate Hitler's personality by choosing adoptive parents similar to Hitler's own [[Alois Hitler|abusive father]] and [[Klara Hitler|doting mother]]. The deaths of the fathers were engineered to mimic Hitler's childhood.\n\nSensing imminent discovery, Mengele's superiors terminate the project; Mengele angrily vows to continue alone. He travels to rural [[Pennsylvania]], where one of the Hitler clones, teenager Bobby Wheelock, lives on a farm with his parents. Mengele murders the boy's father, just prior to Lieberman's arrival. The two men struggle and Lieberman is shot and badly wounded, but manages to release the vicious family [[Doberman Pinscher]]s. The trained dogs corner Mengele until Bobby arrives home from school.\n\nMengele proudly reveals the boy's origins, but Bobby doubts the story. Finding his father murdered, Bobby instructs the dogs to kill the Nazi doctor, watching coldly as the man dies.\n\nLater, while recovering from his injuries in hospital, Lieberman burns Mengele's list of the names and whereabouts of the other boys, declaring that the clones are innocent children who may yet grow up to be harmless. The final scene shows Bobby Wheelock's fascination with his freshly-developed photographs of Mengele's corpse.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Gregory Peck]] as Dr. [[Josef Mengele]]\n* [[Laurence Olivier]] as Ezra Lieberman\n* [[James Mason]] as Col.

In 1999, by [[Artisan Entertainment]], and 2009 by [[Lionsgate Home Entertainment]], the film was released uncut on DVD in the U.S. and uncut in Germany on its DVDs.\n\n[[Lew Grade]], who partly financed the film, was not happy with the final result, feeling that the ending was too gory. He says he protested but Franklin J. Schaffner, who had final cut rights, overruled him.<ref name=\"grade\">Lew Grade, ''Still Dancing: My Story'', William Collins & Sons 1987 p 248</ref>\n\nIn 2015, [[Shout!
