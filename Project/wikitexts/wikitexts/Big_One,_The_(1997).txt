The film documents Moore during his tour promoting his 1996 book ''[[Downsize This!]]'' around the United States. Through the 47 towns he visits, Moore discovers and describes American economic failings and the fear of [[unemployment]] of American workers.\n\n==Background==\nMuch of the film features Moore unsuccessfully chasing the heads and chief executives of major corporations around the US in order to confront them or conduct a personal in-depth interview. He is eventually able to talk with [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]]. The film criticizes [[President of the United States|President]] [[Bill Clinton]], and other major candidates in the [[U.S. presidential election, 1996|1996 presidential election]], for failure to address economic issues. It discusses Clinton's betrayal of progressive economic ideals.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Official website|http://www.miramax.com/movie/the-big-one}}\n*{{IMDb title|0124295|The Big One}}\n* {{Amg movie|158681|The Big One}}\n\n{{Michael Moore}}\n{{Navboxes\n|title = Awards for ''The Big One''\n|list =\n{{Boston Society of Film Critics Award for Best Documentary Film}}\n{{Online Film Critics Society Award for Best Documentary Film}}\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Big One, The}}\n[[Category:1997 films]]\n[[Category:American business films]]\n[[Category:American documentary films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Michael Moore]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Minnesota]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Portland, Oregon]]\n[[Category:Documentary films about business]]\n[[Category:1997 documentary films]]\n[[Category:Unemployment in the United States]]\n[[Category:1990s English-language films]]\n[[Category:1990s American films]]\n[[Category:Films about companies]]\n\n\n{{poli-documentary-film-stub}}"}]}}}}
