It stars [[Al Pacino]] and [[Russell Crowe]], with supporting actors including [[Christopher Plummer]], [[Bruce McGill]], [[Diane Venora]] and [[Michael Gambon]].\n\nA fictionalized account of a true story, it is based on the ''[[60 Minutes]]'' segment about [[Jeffrey Wigand]], a whistleblower in the [[big tobacco|tobacco industry]],<ref>{{cite video|date=1999|title=The Insider |medium=Motion picture|publisher=Touchstone Pictures|time=2:33:32|quote=Although based on a true story, certain elements in this motion picture have been fictionalized for dramatic effect.}}</ref> covering his and CBS producer [[Lowell Bergman]]'s struggles as they defend his testimony against efforts to discredit and suppress it by CBS and Wigand's former employer.\n\nThough not a box office success, ''The Insider'' received acclaim from critics, who praised Crowe's portrayal of Wigand, and Mann's direction. It was nominated for seven [[Academy Awards]], including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]] and [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor in a Leading Role]] (for Russell Crowe).\n\n==Plot==\nDuring a prologue, a [[CBS]] producer, [[Lowell Bergman]], convinces the founder of Hezbollah, [[Mohammad Hussein Fadlallah|Sheikh Fadlallah]], to grant an interview to [[Mike Wallace]] for ''[[60 Minutes]]''. While preparing for the interview, both Wallace and Bergman firmly stand their ground against the Sheikh's armed and hostile bodyguards' attempted intimidation and disruption.\n\nLater, Bergman approaches [[Jeffrey Wigand]]\u2014a former executive at the [[Brown & Williamson]] tobacco company\u2014for help explaining technical documents. Wigand agrees, but intrigues Bergman when he adds that he won\u2019t discuss anything else, citing a [[confidentiality agreement]]. B&W later coerce Wigand into a more restrictive agreement, leading Wigand to accuse Bergman of having betrayed him. Bergman subsequently visits Wigand to defend himself and investigate the potential story. Wigand, though apparently possessing very damaging information, is hesitant to jeopardize his [[severance package]] with B&W by revealing anything.\n\nWigand's family move into a more modest house, and Wigand begins working as a teacher. One night Wigand finds evidence of trespass, and receives a sinister phone call. Meanwhile, Bergman contacts [[Richard Scruggs]], an attorney representing [[Mississippi]] in a lawsuit against the tobacco industry, suggesting that if they [[Deposition (law)|deposed]] Wigand, it could negate his confidentiality agreement and give CBS cover to broadcast the information; Scruggs expresses interest. Some time later, Wigand receives an emailed death threat and finds a bullet in his mailbox. He contacts the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]], but the agents who visit him are hostile and confiscate his computer. A furious Wigand demands that Bergman arrange an interview, in which Wigand states that he was fired after he objected to B&W intentionally making their cigarettes more addictive.\n\nBergman later arranges a security detail for Wigand's home, and the Wigands suffer marital stress. Wigand testifies in Mississippi, over the objections of B&W attorneys, despite having been served with a [[gag order]]. On returning home, he discovers that his wife Liane has left him and taken their daughters. Eric Kluster, the president of [[CBS News]], decides not to broadcast Wigand's interview, after CBS legal counsel Helen Caperelli warns that the network is at risk of legal action from B&W. Bergman confronts Kluster, believing that he is protecting the impending sale of CBS to [[Westinghouse Electric Corporation (1886)|Westinghouse]], which would enrich both Kluster and Caperelli. Wallace, and their executive producer [[Don Hewitt]], both side with Kluster. Wigand, learning of this, is appalled, and terminates contact with Bergman.\n\nInvestigators probe Wigand's personal history and publish their findings in a 500-page dossier. Bergman learns that ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' intends to use it in a piece questioning Wigand's credibility. He convinces the editor of the ''Journal'' to delay while [[Jack Palladino]], an attorney and investigator, evaluates it. After infighting at CBS over the Wigand segment, Bergman is ordered to take a \"vacation\", as the abridged ''60 Minutes'' segment airs. Bergman contacts Wigand, who is both dejected and furious, accusing Bergman of manipulating him. Bergman defends himself and praises Wigand and his testimony. Scruggs urges Bergman to air the full segment to draw public support for their lawsuit, itself under threat by a lawsuit from Mississippi's governor. Bergman is unable to assist, and privately questions his own motives in pursuing the story.\n\nBergman contacts an editor at ''[[The New York Times]]'', disclosing the full story and events at CBS. The ''Times'' prints the story on the front page, and condemns CBS in a scathing editorial. The ''Journal'' dismisses the dossier as [[character assassination]] and prints Wigand's deposition. Hewitt accuses Bergman of betraying CBS, but finds that Wallace now agrees that bowing to corporate pressure was a mistake. ''60 Minutes'' finally airs the original segment, including the full interview with Wigand. Bergman tells Wallace that he has resigned, believing ''60 Minutes''<nowiki/>'s credibility and integrity is now permanently tarnished.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=18em}}\n* [[Al Pacino]] as [[Lowell Bergman]]\n* [[Russell Crowe]] as [[Dr. Jeffrey Wigand]]\n* [[Christopher Plummer]] as [[Mike Wallace]]\n* [[Diane Venora]] as Liane Wigand\n* [[Philip Baker Hall]] as [[Don Hewitt]]\n* [[Lindsay Crouse]] as Sharon Tiller\n* [[Debi Mazar]] as Debbie De Luca\n* [[Renee Olstead]] as Deborah Wigand\n* [[Hallie Kate Eisenberg]] as Barbara Wigand\n* [[Stephen Tobolowsky]] as Eric Kluster\n* [[Colm Feore]] as [[Richard Scruggs]]\n* [[Bruce McGill]] as [[Ron Motley]]\n* [[Gina Gershon]] as Helen Caperelli\n* [[Michael Gambon]] as B&W CEO Thomas Sandefur\n* [[Rip Torn]] as John Scanlon\n* [[Cliff Curtis]] as Sheikh Fadlallah\n* [[Gary Sandy]] as Sandefur's lawyer\n* [[Roger Bart]] as Seelbach hotel manager\n* [[Jack Palladino]] as himself\n* [[Mike Moore (U.S. politician)|Mike Moore]] as himself\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n{{More citations needed section|date=July 2016}}\nWith a budget set at $68 million,<ref name=\"numbers\">{{cite web| url=http://www.the-numbers.com/movie/Insider-The#tab=summary| title=The Insider (1999): Metrics| publisher=Nash Information Services, LLC| access-date=June 18, 2016}}</ref> Mann began collecting a massive amount of documents to research the events depicted in the film: depositions, news reports and ''60 Minutes'' transcripts. He had read a screenplay that [[Eric Roth]] had written, called ''[[The Good Shepherd (film)|The Good Shepherd]]'', about the first 25 years of the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]]. Based on this script, Mann approached Roth to help him co-write ''The Insider''. Mann and Roth wrote several outlines together and talked about the structure of the story. Roth interviewed Bergman numerous times for research and the two men became friends. After he and Mann wrote the first draft together, at the bar at the Broadway Deli in [[Santa Monica]], Roth met Wigand. The whistleblower was still under his confidentiality agreement and would not break it for Roth or Mann. Roth's initial impressions of Wigand were that he came across as unlikable and defensive. As they continued to write more drafts, the two men made minor adjustments in chronology and invented some extraneous dialogue but also stuck strictly to the facts whenever possible. However, Mann and Roth were not interested in making a documentary.\n\n[[Val Kilmer]] was considered by Mann for the role of Jeffrey Wigand. Producer Pieter Jan Brugge suggested Russell Crowe and after seeing him in ''[[L.A. Confidential (film)|L.A. Confidential]]'', Mann flew Crowe down from Canada where he was on location filming ''[[Mystery, Alaska]]'' on the actor's one day off and had him read scenes from ''The Insider'' screenplay for two to three hours. When Crowe read the scene where Wigand finds out that the ''60 Minutes'' interview he did will not be aired, he captured the essence of Wigand so well that Mann knew he had found the perfect actor for the role. Crowe, who was only 33 years old at the time, was apprehensive at playing someone much older than himself when there were so many good actors in that age range. Once Crowe was cast, he and Mann spent six weeks together before shooting began, talking about his character and his props, clothes and accessories. Crowe put on {{convert|35|lb|kg}} for the role, shaved back his hairline, bleached his hair seven times and had a daily application of wrinkles and liver spots to his skin to transform himself into Wigand (who was in his early-to-mid-50s during the events depicted in the film). Crowe was not able to talk to Wigand about his experiences because he was still bound by his confidentiality agreement during much of the film's development period. To get a handle on the man's voice and how he talked, Crowe listened repeatedly to a six-hour tape of Wigand.\n\nAl Pacino was Mann's only choice to play Lowell Bergman. He wanted to see the actor play a role that he had never seen him do in a movie before. Pacino, who had worked with Mann previously in ''Heat'', was more than willing to take on the role. To research for the film, Mann and Pacino hung out with reporters from ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine, spent time with [[ABC News]] and Pacino actually met Bergman to help get in character.\n\nPacino suggested Mann cast Christopher Plummer in the role of [[Mike Wallace]]. Pacino had seen the veteran actor on the stage many times and was a big fan of Plummer's work. Mann had also wanted to work with Plummer since the 1970s. Pacino told Mann to watch Plummer in [[Sidney Lumet]]'s ''[[Stage Struck (1958 film)|Stage Struck]]'' (1958), and afterwards he was the director's only choice to play Wallace\u2014Plummer did not have to audition. He met with Mann and after several discussions was cast in the film.\n\nFor the scene in which the deposition hearing takes place, the filmmakers used the actual courtroom in [[Pascagoula, Mississippi]] where the deposition was given.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.jeffreywigand.com/theinsider.php|title=Jeffrey Wigand : The Insider|website=www.jeffreywigand.com|access-date=July 29, 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Accuracy==\n{{see also|Brown & Williamson#Controversies}}\n''The Insider'' was adapted from \"The Man Who Knew Too Much\", an influential article on [[tobacco industry]] [[whistleblower]] [[Jeffrey Wigand]], written by journalist [[Marie Brenner]] for the May 1996 issue of ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]''.<ref>{{cite news|last=Brenner|first=Marie|title=The Man Who Knew Too Much| url=http://www.vanityfair.com/magazine/archive/1996/05/wigand199605|newspaper=Vanity Fair|date=May 1996}}</ref>\n\n[[Mike Wallace]] said that two-thirds of the film was quite accurate, but he disagreed with the film's portrayal of his role in the events; in particular, he objected to the impression that he would have taken a long time to protest CBS's corporate policies.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.achievement.org/autodoc/page/wal2int-5 | title=Mike Wallace | date=May 24, 2008 | publisher=American Academy of Achievement | access-date=June 18, 2016 | url-status=dead | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160602070133/http://www.achievement.org/autodoc/page/wal2int-5 | archive-date=June 2, 2016 | df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Box office===\n''The Insider'' was released in 1,809 theaters on November 5, 1999 where it grossed a total of $6,712,361 on its opening weekend and ranked fourth in the country for that time period.

[[The Walt Disney Studios (division)|Disney]] executives had hoped that Mann's film would have the same commercial and critical success as ''[[All the President's Men (film)|All the President's Men]]'', a film in the same vein. However, ''The Insider'' had limited appeal to younger moviegoers (studio executives reportedly said the prime audience was over the age of 40) and the subject matter was \"not notably dramatic,\" according to marketing executives. Then-Disney chairman [[Joe Roth]] said, \"It's like walking up a hill with a refrigerator on your back. The fact of the matter is we're really proud we did this movie.
