The [[Film adaptation|adapted screenplay]] was written by Marc Moss and Kerry Williamson. It is based on the 2006 novel ''[[Cross (novel)|Cross]]'' by [[James Patterson]] and is the third installment of the [[Alex Cross (film series)|''Alex Cross'' film series]], which was considered as a [[Reboot (fiction)|reboot]] of the series. The title character was previously portrayed by [[Morgan Freeman]] in ''[[Kiss the Girls (1997 film)|Kiss the Girls]]'' (1997) and ''[[Along Came a Spider (film)|Along Came a Spider]]'' (2001). Unlike the previous films, which were distributed by [[Paramount Pictures]], the film was released by [[Lionsgate|Lionsgate Films]] on October 19, 2012. It was panned by critics and audiences, and became a [[box office bomb]].\n\n==Plot==\nDr. [[Alex Cross]] is a psychologist and police lieutenant who lives in [[Detroit]] with his wife Maria and their children. After learning Maria is pregnant, Cross considers accepting a job as an [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] profiler in [[Washington, D.C.]] Meanwhile, a man participates in an underground fighting match and seduces businesswoman Fan Yau. The man is invited to Yau's house, where he kills her after injecting her with [[Tetrodotoxin|TTX]].\n\nAt the crime scene, Cross finds a charcoal sketch left behind by the killer in the style of the artist [[Picasso]], leading to the murderer being nicknamed after him. While examining the sketch, Cross deduces that Picasso's next target is German businessman Erich Nunemarcher. Picasso attempts to kill Nunemarcher but is foiled by Cross, and escapes after being shot by Cross's partner Tommy Kane. Cross deduces that Picasso also plans to target billionaire CEO Giles Mercier.\n\nAs revenge for foiling his attack on Nunemarcher, Picasso attacks Cross and Kane's colleague, Monica Ashe, torturing her to death. Picasso then tracks down Cross, who is on a date with Maria, and kills her with a sniper rifle.\n\nPicasso targets Nunemarcher and Mercier at a conference, killing Nunemarcher and seemingly Mercier. Cross and Kane track Picasso to the abandoned [[Michigan Building|Michigan Theater]]. As Cross and Picasso fight, they fall through the crumbling theater ceiling. Cross kicks Picasso off the ceiling, killing him and avenging Maria. Kane helps pull Cross to safety.\n\nCross deduces Picasso's employer was Mercier himself. Having embezzled money from his clients, Mercier asked for Yau and Nunemarcher's help to fake his death and flee to [[Bali]], then hired Picasso to eliminate them and a double pretending to be the real Mercier. After Cross frames Mercier for drug smuggling, Mercier is arrested in [[Indonesia]], where he will be condemned to [[Capital punishment in Indonesia|death by firing squad]]. Having avenged Maria's murder, Cross decides to accept the job offer from the FBI and moves to Washington with his family.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Tyler Perry]] as Dr. / Detective [[Alex Cross]]\n* [[Edward Burns]] as Detective Tommy Kane\n* [[Matthew Fox]] as Michael 'The Butcher of Sligo' Sullivan / Picasso\n* [[Jean Reno]] as Giles Mercier\n* [[Carmen Ejogo]] as Maria Cross\n* [[Cicely Tyson]] as Regina 'Nana Mama' Cross\n* [[Rachel Nichols (actress)|Rachel Nichols]] as Detective Monica Ashe\n* [[John C.
