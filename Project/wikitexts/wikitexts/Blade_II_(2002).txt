Goyer]]. A sequel to ''[[Blade (1998 film)|Blade]]'' (1998), it is the second installment in the [[Blade (franchise)|''Blade'' franchise]], followed by ''[[Blade: Trinity]]''. The film follows the [[Dhampir|human-vampire hybrid]] [[Blade (New Line franchise character)|Blade]] in his continuing effort to [[Vampire hunter|protect humans from vampires]], finding himself in a fierce battle against a group of mutant vampires who seek to commit global genocide of both vampire and human races. Blade and his human allies are coerced into joining forces with a special elite group of vampires.\n\n''Blade II'' was released on March 22, 2002 and was a box office success, grossing over $155 million. It received mixed reviews from critics, earning praise for its performances, atmosphere, direction, and action sequences, although its script and lack of character development have been criticized.\n\n==Plot==\n[[Blade (New Line franchise character)|Blade]] searches [[Prague]] for his mentor [[Abraham Whistler]], who was thought dead after being attacked by [[Deacon Frost]], but was instead turned into a [[Vampire (Marvel Comics)|vampire]] and held prisoner for two years. Blade rescues Whistler and cures him. Whistler meets Scud, Blade's young new technician and [[marijuana]] smoker who likes [[rap]] music.\n\nA pandemic is turning vampires into \"Reapers\", primal, mutant creatures with a ravenous thirst for blood and a highly infectious bite that transforms both human and vampire alike. In order to combat the Reapers, vampire overlord Eli Damaskinos sends his minion, Asad, and daughter Nyssa to strike a truce with Blade; who become reluctantly allies with the vampires. He teams up with the Bloodpack, an elite group of vampires originally assembled to kill him. The pack consists of Asad, Nyssa, Reinhardt, Chupa, Snowman, Priest, Verlaine, and her lover Lighthammer. Reinhardt hates Blade, and challenges him to fight, but in response Blade implants an explosive on his head to keep him in line.\n\nThey investigate a vampire nightclub where they encounter the Reapers and discover they are immune to most vampire weaknesses. The Reaper leader, Jared Nomak, arrives and holds Nyssa hostage. He tries to recruit Blade to his cause, citing their mutual hatred of vampires. Priest is bitten and mercy-killed, and Lighthammer is bitten but conceals the bite. Whistler disappears and Scud is attacked by several Reapers, which he drives off with [[Ultraviolet|UV]] lights. Blade fights Nomak, who is immune to Blade's weapons. As the sun rises, Nomak retreats and Whistler returns, revealing he has found the Reaper nest in the sewer. Nyssa dissects a dead Reaper and learns their hearts are encased in durable bone. Realizing UV light is their only weakness, Scud and Whistler make UV weapons for the team, as well as a UV-emitting bomb strong enough to take out the entire nest.\n\nEntering the Reaper nest, the team spreads out. Lighthammer transforms into a Reaper and kills Snowman. Verlaine sacrifices herself to kill Lighthammer by exposing them both to sunlight. Chupa and Reinhardt attack Whistler, who sprays Chupa with a Reaper [[pheromone]]. This attracts a horde which kills Chupa and Whistler escapes. Asad and Nyssa are ambushed and Asad is killed. Blade saves Nyssa and uses the UV-bomb which kills all of the Reapers except for Nomak. Nyssa and Reinhardt manage to evade the blast, but Nyssa is seriously injured until Blade allows her to drink his blood to survive.\n\nDamaskinos' forces betray and capture Blade, Whistler, and Scud. It is revealed that the Reapers exist as a result of Damaskinos' efforts to engineer a stronger breed of vampires. Nomak, the first Reaper, is his own son, whom Damaskinos considers a failure due to his weakness to sunlight. Scud reveals himself to be one of Damaskinos' [[familiars]], but Blade, who already suspected this, kills him with the explosive he planted on Reinhardt earlier. Damaskinos plans to harvest Blade\u2019s blood in order to develop an immunity to sunlight and create a new and entirely invincible breed of vampires. Whistler escapes Reinhardt and frees a nearly drained Blade, who falls into Damaskinos' blood pool, restoring his strength. He fights his way through Damaskinos' henchmen and kills Reinhardt.\n\nNomak enters Damaskinos' stronghold seeking revenge on his father. Nyssa betrays Damaskinos by sealing off their escape route to the heliport and Damaskinos is killed by Nomak after failing to negotiate with him. Nomak then bites Nyssa, drinking her blood. Blade and Nomak engage in battle and Blade stabs Nomak in his only weak spot. With his revenge complete, and wanting to end his suffering, Nomak kills himself with Blade's sword. Fulfilling Nyssa's wish of dying as a vampire, Blade takes her outside and embraces her as her body disintegrates due to the sunrise. Sometime later in London, Blade kills Rush the vampire that escaped in Prague.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Wesley Snipes]] as [[Blade (New Line franchise character)|Eric Brooks / Blade]]: A half-vampire \"daywalker\" (a [[Dhampir]]) who hunts vampires. Wesley Snipes stated that while such a character is not going to have much emotional depth, he also said that \"there's some acting involved in creating the character and making him believable and palatable\".<ref>{{cite news |date= April 1, 2002 |author= Bill Higgins |title= A party with a bite |url= https://variety.com/2002/scene/vpage/a-party-with-a-bite-1117864777/ |work= [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |access-date= 2020-04-04}}</ref>\n* [[Kris Kristofferson]] as [[Abraham Whistler]]: Blade's human mentor and weaponsmith.\n* [[Ron Perlman]] as Dieter Reinhardt: A member of the Bloodpack, who bears a particular grudge against Blade.\n* [[Leonor Varela]] as Nyssa Damaskinos: An unapologetic-but-honourable, natural-born vampire and daughter to Damaskinos.\n* [[Norman Reedus]] as \"Scud\": A young, pot-smoking weaponsmith who aids Blade in Whistler's absence.\n* [[Thomas Kretschmann]] as Eli Damaskinos: An ancient vampire who is obsessed with creating a superior race of vampires as his legacy.\n* [[Luke Goss]] as Jared Nomak: [[Index case (medicine)|Patient zero]] and [[Asymptomatic carrier|carrier]] of the Reaper virus.

Frankfurt first met del Toro when Frankfurt's design company, Imaginary Forces, did the title sequences for ''[[Mimic (film)|Mimic]]'': \"I admired ''Mimic'' and got to know Guillermo through that film. Both David Goyer and I have been fans of his since ''[[Cronos (film)|Cronos]]'' and were enthusiastic about him coming on board. Guillermo is such a visual director and has a very strong sense of how he wants a movie to look. When you sign on with someone like Guillermo you're not going to tell him what the movie should look like, you're going to let him run with it\". Like Goyer, del Toro has a passion for comic books, in Goyer's comment: \"Guillermo was weaned on comic books, as was I. I was a huge comic book collector, my brother and I had about twelve thousand comic books that we assembled when we were kids, so I know my background\". [[Tippett Studio]] provided computer-generated visual effects, including digital doubles of some of the characters, while [[Steve Johnson (special effects artist)|Steve Johnson]] and his company XFX were hired to create the prosthetic makeup and animatronic effects.<ref>{{cite news |date=July 21, 2002 |author= Ellen Wolff |title= Artists flaunt character development at confab |url= https://variety.com/2002/digital/features/artists-flaunt-character-development-at-confab-1117870028/ |work= [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |access-date= 2018-12-24}}</ref>\n\nDel Toro was tired of the romantic concept of \"vampires being tortured Victorian heroes\" and wanted vampires to be scary again.<ref name=\"Cinefantastique\" /> \nDel Toro chose not to alter the script too much from the ideas created by Goyer and Snipes. According to del Toro: \"I wanted the movie to have a feeling of both a comic book and [[Anime|Japanese animation]]. I resurrected those sources and viewed them again. I dissected most of the dailies from the first movie; I literally grabbed about four boxes of tapes and one by one saw every single tape from beginning to end until I perfectly understood where the language of the first film came from. I studied the style of the first one and I think Norrington used a tremendous narrative style. His work is very elegant\".\n\nStepping back into Blade's shoes was a challenge Wesley Snipes relished: \"I love playing this role. It's fun as an actor to test your skills at doing a sequel, to see if you can recreate something that you did\". Peter Frankfurt added that \"Wesley is Blade; so much of the character was invented by Wesley and his instincts are so spot on. He takes his fighting, his weapons and attitude very seriously. He's incredibly focused, but he's also very cool and fun\".\n\nDel Toro said that \"Wesley knows Blade better than David Goyer, better than me, better than anyone else involved in the franchise. He instinctively knows what the character would and wouldn't do, and every time he twists something around, something better would come out\".\n\n[[Principal photography|Filming]] took place in the [[Czech Republic]], at [[Prague Studios]]<ref>{{cite web |date=10 July 2001 |last=Meils |first=Cathy |title=Prague Studios gets $1 million upgrade |url=https://variety.com/2001/film/news/prague-studios-gets-1-million-upgrade-1117802712/ |website=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |date=18 June 2012 |author=Steve Head |title=Prague Studios to House $55 Million Blade 2 |url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2000/11/24/prague-studios-to-house-55-million-blade-2 |website=[[IGN]] }}</ref> and [[Barrandov Studios]], as well as London from March 12, 2001 and concluded on July 2 the same year.\n\n==Music==\n{{main|Blade II (soundtrack)}}\nA soundtrack to the film was released on March 19, 2002 through [[Immortal Records]] and [[Virgin Records]], and which featured collaborations between hip hop artists and electronic artists.
