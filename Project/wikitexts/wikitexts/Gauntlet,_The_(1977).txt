The film's supporting cast includes [[Pat Hingle]], [[William Prince (actor)|William Prince]], [[Bill McKinney]], and [[Mara Corday]]. Eastwood plays a down-and-out cop who falls in love with a prostitute (Locke), to whom he is assigned to escort from [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]] to [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]] for her to testify against [[American Mafia|the mob]].\n\n==Plot==\nBen Shockley, an alcoholic cop from Phoenix, is given the task to escort witness Augustina \"Gus\" Mally from Las Vegas. His superior, Commissioner Edgar A. Blakelock, says she is a \"nothing witness\" for a \"nothing trial\".  Mally protests that they are both set up to be killed in a hit, which a jaded Shockley doubts. Mally reveals herself to be a belligerent prostitute with mob ties and is in possession of incriminating information concerning a high figure in society.\n\nHer suspicions are confirmed when the transport vehicle is [[car bomb|bombed]] and Mally's house is fired upon. Shockley and Mally are then pursued across the open country with no official assistance and with the police force regarding them as fugitives. They kidnap a local constable, whom they then let go, as Mally knows there ill be another hit. The constable is killed at the hands of several men armed with machine guns. They eventually run into a gang of bikers, whom Shockley threatens with his revolver, then confiscates one of their motorcycles and takes off on it with Mally.\n\nBlakelock is revealed to want the pair dead because Mally understands about Blakelock's secret life. Assistant District Attorney John Feyderspiel is involved with the plot to kill Shockley and Mally. They are also blamed for the death of the constable.\n\nThe two ride into a town where Shockley and Mally are ambushed by a helicopter filled with cops sent by Blakelock, who pursues the two onto the open road, firing at them from above with a rifle. During the high-speed pursuit, the helicopter flies into a set of power wires and explodes. The two ditch the damaged motorcycle and hop on a train, on which, coincidentally, the same two bikers whose machine they had \"borrowed\" are riding. The bikers attack and assault Shockley and attempt to rape Mally. The wounded Shockley grabs hold of his gun and subdues the bikers, knocking them and their girlfriend off the train. Shockley and Mally both realize that going back to Phoenix will be suicide, but it is the only way to prove their innocence.\n\nThe two hijack a bus and outfit it with a crude set of armor made from scrap steel. They are about to enter Phoenix when Maynard Josephson, an old friend of Shockley's, warns the two of a gauntlet of armed police officers that Blakelock has set up to \"welcome\" them. Josephson convinces Shockley to turn himself in to Feyderspiel, whom he thinks is an honest broker. As the pair follow Josephson out of the bus, Josephson is shot dead by snipers from a nearby building, and Shockley is hit in the leg.\n\nWith no other option, the two return to the bus and enter the town.  The bus is shot at as it runs the titular \"gauntlet\" of hundreds of armed officers lining both sides of the road, until it reaches the steps of City Hall, finally immobilized. The two emerge from the riddled bus and surrender, but Shockley uses Feyderspiel as a shield, to have him confess that Blakelock and Feyderspiel are both corrupt. The enraged Blakelock opens fire, killing Feyderspiel and wounding Shockley. Blakelock is then killed by Mally. Realizing Blakelock's crime and having witnessed his wanton killing of Feyderspiel, the rest of the assembled officers watch as Shockley and Mally walk away safely from the gauntlet.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}<!-- Cast list is in credits order and named as credited; please do not change. -->\n* [[Clint Eastwood]] as Detective Ben Shockley\n* [[Sondra Locke]] as Augustina \"Gus\" Mally\n* [[Pat Hingle]] as Detective Maynard Josephson\n* [[William Prince (actor)|William Prince]] as Commissioner Edgar A.
