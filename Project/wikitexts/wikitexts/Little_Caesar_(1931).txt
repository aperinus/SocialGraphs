Robinson]], [[Glenda Farrell]], and [[Douglas Fairbanks Jr.]]   The film tells the story of a hoodlum who ascends the ranks of [[organized crime]] until he reaches its upper echelons. The storyline was adapted from the novel of the same name by [[William R. Burnett]]. ''Little Caesar'' was Robinson's breakthrough role and immediately made him a major film star. The film is often listed as one of the first fully-fledged [[Mob film#1930s|gangster films]] and continues to be well received by critics.\n\nIn 2000, ''Little Caesar'' was included in the annual selection of 25 motion pictures added to the [[National Film Registry]] of the [[Library of Congress]] being deemed \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\" and recommended for preservation.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Librarian of Congress Names 25 More Films to National Film Registry|url=https://www.loc.gov/item/prn-00-200/librarian-of-congress-names-25-more-films-to-national-film-registry/2000-12-27/|access-date=November 23, 2020|website=Library of Congress}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Complete National Film Registry Listing |url=https://www.loc.gov/programs/national-film-preservation-board/film-registry/complete-national-film-registry-listing/|access-date=November 23, 2020|website=Library of Congress}}</ref> The Library of Congress maintains a print.<ref>''Catalog of Holdings The American Film Institute Collection and The United Artists Collection at The Library of Congress'', (<-book title) p.104 c.1978 by The American Film Institute</ref>\n\n== Plot ==\nSmall-time criminals Caesar Enrico \"Rico\" Bandello and his friend Joe Massara move to [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]] to seek their fortunes. Rico joins the gang of Sam Vettori, while Joe wants to be a dancer. Olga becomes his dance partner and girlfriend.\n\nJoe tries to drift away from the gang and its activities, but Rico makes him participate in the robbery of the nightclub where he works. Despite orders from underworld overlord \"Big Boy\" to all his men to avoid bloodshed, Rico guns down crusading crime commissioner Alvin McClure during the robbery, with Joe as an aghast witness.\n\nRico accuses Sam of becoming soft and seizes control of his organization. Rival boss \"Little Arnie\" Lorch tries to have Rico killed, but Rico is only grazed. He and his gunmen pay Little Arnie a visit, after which Arnie hastily departs for [[Detroit]]. The Big Boy eventually gives Rico control of all of Chicago's Northside.\n\nRico becomes concerned that Joe knows too much about him. He warns Joe that he must forget about Olga and join him in a life of crime. Rico threatens to kill both Joe and Olga unless he accedes, but Joe refuses to give in. Olga calls Police Sergeant Flaherty and tells him Joe is ready to talk, just before Rico and his henchman Otero come calling. Rico finds, to his surprise, that he is unable to take his friend's life. When Otero tries to do the job himself, Rico wrestles the gun away from him, though not before Joe is wounded. Hearing the shot, Flaherty and another police officer give chase and injure and capture Otero. With information provided by Olga, Flaherty proceeds to crush Rico's organization.\n\nDesperate and alone, Rico \"retreats to the gutter from which he sprang.\" While hiding in a [[flophouse]], he becomes enraged when he learns that Flaherty has called him a coward in the newspaper. He foolishly telephones the police to announce he is coming for him. The call is traced, and he is gunned down by Flaherty behind a billboard&nbsp;\u2013 an advertisement featuring dancers Joe and Olga&nbsp;\u2013 and, dying, utters his final words, \"Mother of mercy, is this the end of Rico?\"\n\n== Cast ==\n[[File:Douglas Fairbanks Jr and Glenda Farrell.jpg|thumb|Douglas Fairbanks Jr. and Glenda Farrell as Joe and Olga]]\n* [[Edward G.
