The screenplay by [[Kriss Turner]] focuses on [[interracial relationships]] and traditional [[African American]] [[family values]] and social customs.\n\n==Plot==\nKenya McQueen is a successful, single African American woman who has sacrificed romance in order to pursue a career as a [[certified public accountant]]. Her rigid desire for perfection and control has manifested itself in the bland, [[Monochrome|monochromatic]] decor of her new home and the rigid rules she follows in her personal life. Urged to loosen up by her friends, Kenya accepts a [[wiktionary:blind date|blind date]] with [[landscape architect]] Brian Kelly arranged by her co-worker Leah Cahan, who is in the process of planning the kind of wedding Kenya wants herself. The two meet at [[Starbucks]], and she is surprised to discover Brian is white. She quickly excuses herself and leaves.\n\nThe two unexpectedly meet again at a party at Leah's parents' home, where Brian landscaped the grounds. Impressed with his work, Kenya decides to hire him to renovate her unkempt backyard garden. As time passes, their employer-employee relationship evolves into a friendship and then love.\n\nAlthough Brian is helping her feel more comfortable about her living environment, Kenya finds it difficult to dismiss her reservations about their romance. The opinions of her girlfriends Cheryl, Nedra, and Suzette, her [[African-American upper class|upper class]] parents Joyce and Edmond, and her [[Promiscuity|womanizing]] younger brother Nelson begin to have a deleterious effect and Brian's unwillingness to discuss issues of color drives them apart.\n\nNelson introduces his sister to someone she views as a more acceptable suitor, tax attorney Mark Harper, who has just relocated to Los Angeles. The two begin to date, and while Joyce thoroughly approves, Edmond senses his daughter is not as happy as she was with Brian. Everything Kenya thought she wanted suddenly seems immaterial, and nothing Mark does ignites a spark between them. When the [[Cognitive dissonance|dissonance]] she's developed finally overwhelms her, Kenya chooses to reunite with Brian, no longer allowing her controlling nature and [[Norm (sociology)|social norms]] to dictate matters of the heart.\n\nKenya marries Brian amongst their closest friends and loved ones.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Sanaa Lathan]] as Kenya Denise McQueen\n* [[Simon Baker]] as Brian Kelly\n* [[Blair Underwood]] as Mark Harper\n* [[Donald Faison]] as Nelson McQueen, Kenya's brother\n* [[Alfre Woodard]] as Joyce McQueen, Kenya's mother\n* [[Earl Billings]] as Edmond McQueen, Kenya's father\n* Katharine Towne as Leah Cahan\n* [[Stanley DeSantis]] as Jack Pino\n* [[Mike Epps]] as Walter, Cheryl's husband\n* [[Julie Mond]] as Penelope, Brian's Ex\n* [[Lee Garlington]] as Mrs. Cahan\n* [[Taraji P.

[in which] the chemistry between the leads is as unmistakable as the setup is contrived ... The lovely Ms. Lathan ... and the similarly attractive Mr. Baker ... don't just look good together; they feel right in sync.

The movie respects its subject and characters, and is more complex about race than we could possibly expect.

However, the characterizations, even the leads, rarely rise above archetypes.

I like Hamri's approach to material that might be offensive from a solidly black or white perspective. It all makes the foundational sameness of the story easier to take.
