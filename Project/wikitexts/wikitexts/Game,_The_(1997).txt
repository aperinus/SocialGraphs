It tells the story of a wealthy investment banker who is given a mysterious gift by his brother\u2014participation in a game that integrates in strange ways with his everyday life. As the lines between the banker's real life and the game become more uncertain, hints of a large conspiracy become apparent.\n\n''The Game'' was well received by critics like [[Roger Ebert]] and major periodicals like ''The New York Times'', but had middling box-office returns compared to the success of Fincher's previous film ''[[Seven (1995 film)|Se7en]]'' (1995). The film later gained a strong cult following among Fincher's fans with some noting it as one of his most underrated films.<ref>https://www.pastemagazine.com/movies/the-game-david-fincher-twist/</ref><ref>https://www.pastemagazine.com/movies/david-fincher-ranked/</ref><ref>https://www.goldderby.com/gallery/david-fincher-movies-ranked/</ref><ref>https://www.esquire.com/entertainment/movies/g36178192/best-david-fincher-movies/</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nNicholas Van Orton, a wealthy, selfish investment banker in [[San Francisco]], has dinner with his estranged younger brother Conrad, who gifts him an unusual present for his 48th birthday\u2014 a voucher for a game offered by a company called Consumer Recreation Services (CRS). Though sceptical, he goes to the CRS office to apply, but the time-consuming psychological and physical examinations required irritate him, and he is later informed that his application has been rejected.\n\nNicholas returns home one evening to find a wooden clown outside, and later discovers a hidden camera inside. He is also contacted by a CRS employee through his distorted television screen who tells him not to try and figure out the object of the game. More bizarre events continue happening; Nicholas initially thinks CRS are simply staging elaborate pranks, but then he starts to believe his business, reputation and safety are endangered. Nicholas is also haunted by his father's suicide, which he witnessed as a child. He meets a waitress, Christine, who becomes involved. Nicholas contacts the police, but they find the CRS office abandoned.\n\nConrad visits Nicholas and apologizes, claiming CRS has attacked him. With no one else to turn to, Nicholas finds Christine's home, and discovers she is a CRS employee. When she tells him they are being watched, Nicholas attacks a nearby camera, and armed CRS personnel swarm the house. When they fire at the two of them, Nicholas and Christine flee. Christine later tells him CRS has drained his bank accounts by guessing his passwords using the psychological tests he completed; his bank confirms such. He then begins to feel dizzy and realizes Christine has drugged him. As he loses consciousness, she admits she is part of the scam and says he made a fatal mistake in giving his card security code over the phone.\n\nNicholas wakes entombed alive in a Mexico cemetery. He sells his watch to return to San Francisco, where he finds his mansion foreclosed and most of his possessions removed. He contacts the hotel where Conrad was staying, and is told his brother has been committed to a mental institution following a nervous breakdown. Nicholas retrieves a hidden gun and seeks his ex-wife for help. While apologizing to her for his neglect, he learns that Jim Feingold, the CRS employee who conducted his tests, is an actor working in television advertisements. He forces Jim to find the real CRS office and takes Christine hostage, demanding to be taken to the head of CRS.\n\nAttacked by CRS guards, Nicholas takes Christine to the roof. Christine, realizing Nicholas's gun is not a prop, frantically tells him it is only a game; his finances are intact, and his family and friends are waiting on the other side of the door. He refuses to believe her, and Nicholas shoots the first person to emerge\u2014 Conrad, bearing a bottle of champagne. Devastated, Nicholas then leaps off the roof but lands on a giant air cushion. He is greeted by Conrad (who is alive since the gun was indeed actually a prop, and Christine's fear of the gun faked) and the rest of the people from the game; absolutely everything had been staged by Conrad for his birthday present, with the intention of helping Nicholas become a better person and embrace life.\n\nAfter a birthday party with friends, Christine (whose real name is revealed to be Claire) declines Nicholas' offer for a date as she has another job lined up in Australia. She instead agrees to have coffee with him at the airport.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Michael Douglas]] as Nicholas Van Orton\n* [[Sean Penn]] as Conrad Van Orton\n* [[Deborah Kara Unger]] as Christine / Claire\n* [[James Rebhorn]] as Jim Feingold\n* [[Peter Donat]] as Samuel Sutherland\n* [[Carroll Baker]] as Ilsa\n* [[Armin Mueller-Stahl]] as Anson Baer\n* [[Anna Katarina]] as Elizabeth\n* [[Charles Martinet]] as Nicholas' father\n* [[Mark Boone Junior]] as Shady Private Investigator\n* [[Tommy Flanagan (actor)|Tommy Flanagan]] as Solicitor/Taxi Driver\n* [[Spike Jonze]] as Airbag EMT Beltran\n* [[Linda Manz]] as Amy\n* [[Daniel Schorr]] as himself (newscaster)\n}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\n''The Game'' began as a [[Spec script|spec screenplay]], written by [[John Brancato and Michael Ferris]] in 1991.<ref name=\"Swallow\"/> It was sold that year to [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]], who put the project in [[Turnaround (filmmaking)|turnaround]], where it was picked up by [[Propaganda Films]]. Director [[Jonathan Mostow]] was originally attached to the project with [[Kyle MacLachlan]] and [[Bridget Fonda]] cast in the lead roles. Principal photography was to start in February 1993 but in early 1992, the project was moved to PolyGram Filmed Entertainment. Mostow was no longer the director of the film but instead became an executive producer.<ref name=\"Swallow\"/> Producer [[Steve Golin]] bought the script from MGM and gave it to David Fincher in the hopes that he would direct.<ref name=\"Swallow2\">Swallow 2003, p. 92.</ref> Fincher liked the various plot twists but brought in [[Andrew Kevin Walker]], who had worked with him on ''[[Seven (1995 film)|Seven]]'', to make the character of Nicholas more cynical in nature. Fincher and Walker spent six weeks changing the tone and trying to make the story work.<ref name=\"Swallow2\"/> According to David Fincher, there were three primary influences on ''The Game''. Michael Douglas' character was a \"fashionable, good-looking [[Ebenezer Scrooge|Scrooge]], lured into a ''[[Mission: Impossible (1966 TV series)|Mission: Impossible]]'' situation with a steroid shot in the thigh from ''[[The Sting]]''\".<ref name=\"Arnold, Gary\">{{cite news | last = Arnold | first = Gary | title = Director Fincher Learns More About ''Game'' of Making Movies | work = [[Washington Times]] | date = September 14, 1997 }}</ref> He said in an interview that his film differs from others of that kind because \"movies usually make a pact with the audience that says: we're going to play it straight. What we show you is going to add up. But we don't do that. In that respect, it's about movies and how movies dole out information\".<ref name=\"Gilbey, Ryan\">{{cite news | last = Gilbey | first = Ryan | title = Precocious prankster who gets a thrill from tripping people up | work = [[The Independent]] | date = October 10, 1997 | url = https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/film-precocious-prankster-who-gets-a-thrill-from-tripping-people-up-1234916.html | access-date = October 1, 2010 }}</ref> Furthermore, Fincher has said that the film is about \"loss of control. The purpose of ''The Game'' is to take your greatest fear, put it ''this'' close to your face and say 'There, you're still alive. It's all right.'\"<ref name=\"Swallow\">Swallow 2003, p. 91.</ref> More revisions were made to the script, including removing a scene where Nicholas kills Christine and then commits suicide, because Fincher felt that this did not make sense.<ref name=\"Swallow3\"/> In 1996, [[Larry Gross]] and Walker were brought in to make revisions to the script.<ref name=\"Swallow4\">Swallow 2003, p. 94.</ref>\n\n===Casting===\nFincher intended to make ''The Game'' before ''[[Seven (1995 film)|Seven]]'', but when [[Brad Pitt]] became available for ''Seven'', that project became top priority.<ref name=\"Swallow2\"/> The success of ''Seven'' helped the producers of ''The Game'' get the larger budget that they wanted. Then, they approached Michael Douglas to star in the film. He was hesitant at first because of concerns that PolyGram was not a big enough company to distribute the film. However, once on board, Douglas' presence helped get the film into production.<ref name=\"Swallow2\"/> At the [[1996 Cannes Film Festival]], PolyGram announced that [[Jodie Foster]] would star in the film with Douglas.<ref name=\"Swallow3\">Swallow 2003, p. 93.</ref> However, Fincher was uncomfortable with putting an actor and movie star of her stature in a supporting part. After talking to her, he considered rewriting the character of Conrad as Nicholas' daughter so that Foster could play that role. However, Douglas didn't like the idea and requested it to change the character to his sister, which Foster found peculiar as Douglas is almost 20 years her senior and appeared with her in ''[[Napoleon and Samantha]]'' when Foster was 9 years old while Douglas was 28. Due to differences in opinions and scheduling conflicts with [[Robert Zemeckis]]' ''[[Contact (1997 American film)|Contact]]'', Foster could not appear in the film. Once she left, the role of Conrad was offered to [[Jeff Bridges]], but he declined, and Sean Penn was cast.<ref name=\"Swallow3\"/> Later, Foster alleged that she and PolyGram orally agreed that she would appear in the film, and when this did not transpire, she took a $54.5 million lawsuit against the company.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://ew.com/article/1996/06/28/jodie-foster-sues-polygram/|title=Jodie Foster sues PolyGram|work=EW.com|access-date=2017-12-19|language=en}}</ref>&nbsp;Deborah Kara Unger's audition for the role of Christine was a test reel consisting of a two-minute sex scene from [[David Cronenberg]]'s ''[[Crash (1996 film)|Crash]]''. Douglas thought it was a joke, but when he and Fincher met her in person, they were impressed by her acting.<ref name=\"hochman\">{{cite news | last = Hochman | first = David | title = Unger Strikes | work = [[Entertainment Weekly]] | date = October 3, 1997 | url = http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,289716,00.html | access-date = September 23, 2009 }}</ref>\n\n===Filming===\nPrincipal photography began on location in San Francisco despite studio pressure to shoot in Los Angeles which was cheaper.<ref name=\"Swallow4\"/> Fincher also considered shooting the film in Chicago and Seattle, but the former had no mansions that were close by and the latter did not have an adequate financial district. The script had been written with San Francisco in mind and he liked the financial district's \"old money, [[Wall Street]] vibe\".<ref name=\"Swallow4\"/> However, that area of the city was very busy and hard to move around in. The production shot on weekends in order to have more control. Fincher utilized old stone buildings, small streets and the city's hills to represent the class system pictorially. To convey the old money world, he set many scenes in restaurants with hardwood paneling and red leather. Some of the locations used in the film included [[Golden Gate Park]], the [[Presidio of San Francisco]], and the historic [[Filoli|Filoli Mansion]], 25 miles south of San Francisco in Woodside, California, which stood in for the Van Orton mansion.<ref name=\"Swallow4\"/>\n\nFor the visual look of Nicholas' wealthy lifestyle, Fincher and the film's cinematographer [[Harris Savides]] wanted a \"rich and supple\" feel and took references from films like ''[[The Godfather]]'' which featured visually appealing locations with ominous intentions lurking under the surface.<ref name=\"Swallow7\">Swallow 2003, p. 102.</ref> According to Fincher, once Nicholas left his protective world, he and Savides would let fluorescents, neon signs and other lights in the background be overexposed to let \"things get a bit wilder out in the real world\".<ref name=\"Swallow7\"/> For ''The Game'', Fincher employed a [[Technicolor]] printing process known as [[Bleach bypass|ENR]] which lent a smoother look to the night sequences. The challenge for him was how much deception could the audience take and \"will they go for 45 minutes of [[red herring]]s?\"<ref name=\"Swallow8\">Swallow 2003, p. 103.</ref> To this end, he tried to stage scenes as simply as possible and use a single camera because \"with multiple cameras, you run the risk of boring people with coverage\".<ref name=\"Swallow8\"/>\n\nThe scene where Nicholas' taxi drives into the [[San Francisco Bay]] was shot near the [[Embarcadero (San Francisco)|Embarcadero]], with the close-up of Douglas trapped in the back seat filmed on a soundstage at [[Sony Pictures Studios]] in a large tank of water.<ref name=\"Swallow5\">Swallow 2003, p. 95.</ref> The actor was in a small compartment that was designed to resemble the backseat of a taxi with three cameras capturing the action.<ref name=\"Farber, Stephen\">{{cite news | last = Farber | first = Stephen | title = A Meeting of Tough Minds in Hollywood | work = [[The New York Times]] | page = 3 | date = August 31, 1997 | url = http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F0081EF63D550C728FDDA10894DF494D81 | access-date = October 1, 2010 }}</ref>\n\nPrincipal photography lasted 100 days with a lot of shooting done at night utilizing numerous locations.<ref name=\"Swallow6\">Swallow 2003, p. 96.</ref>\n\n==Release==\n''The Game'' was released on September 12, 1997, in 2,403 theaters, grossing $14.3 million during its opening weekend.
