The film centres on good-natured yet eccentric cheese-loving inventor Wallace and his intelligent quiet dog, Gromit, in their latest venture as pest control agents. They come to the rescue of their town plagued by rabbits before the annual Giant Vegetable Competition. However, the duo soon find themselves against a giant rabbit consuming the town's crops.\n\nThe film features an expanded cast of characters relative to the previous ''Wallace and Gromit'' shorts, with a voice cast including [[Helena Bonham Carter]] and [[Ralph Fiennes]].

One evening, after capturing rabbits found in the garden of Lady Tottington, Wallace uses two of his latest inventions, the \"Bun-Vac 6000\" and \"Mind Manipulation-O-Matic,\" to brainwash them into disliking vegetables. All goes well until Wallace accidentally sets the Bun-Vac to \"BLOW,\" and his brain is fused with that of a rabbit, forcing Gromit to destroy the Mind-O-Matic. The transfer appears to have worked, as the rabbit shows no interest in vegetables. They name the rabbit Hutch and place him in a cage.\n\nThat night, a giant rabbit devours many people's vegetables and the duo fail to respond. During a town meeting the next day, the creature is revealed to be the ''Were-Rabbit''. Hunter Victor Quartermaine offers to shoot the creature, but Tottington persuades the townsfolk to give Wallace and Gromit a second chance. After Anti-Pesto unsuccessfully tries to trap the rabbit, Wallace suspects that Hutch is the beast and has Gromit lock him in a high-security cage. Gromit then follows a trail of footprints into Wallace's bedroom and finds a pile of half-eaten vegetables inside, indicating that Wallace is the real culprit.\n\nAfter celebrating his success with Tottington, Wallace is cornered in the forest by Victor, who vies for Tottington's affections. Wallace transforms into the Were-Rabbit under the full moon and flees. Now seeing the perfect chance to eliminate his rival, Victor obtains three \"24-[[carat (purity)|carrot]]\" [[Silver bullet|gold bullets]] from the town's [[Vicar (Anglicanism)|vicar]], Reverend Clement Hedges, to use against Wallace.\n\nOn the day of the vegetable competition, Gromit reveals to Wallace that the experiment has swapped his and Hutch's personalities; the latter is now carrying his human traits and is the only one who can fix the Mind-O-Matic. Tottington visits and informs Wallace of about Victor's plan; as the moon rises, Wallace begins to transform again and hastily forces Tottington to leave. Victor arrives and attempts to shoot Wallace with the golden bullets, but Gromit helps Wallace to escape. Once Victor is gone, Gromit and Hutch devise a plan to save Wallace.\n\nAt the competition, after using up all his gold bullets, Victor takes the Golden Carrot trophy to use as ammunition. Wallace, carries Tottington atop Tottington Hall and reveals his true identity to her. Meanwhile, Gromit subdues Victor's dog, Philip, in a [[dogfight]] using aeroplanes taken from a fairground attraction. Gromit then steers his plane into Victor's line of fire as he shoots at Wallace, causing the bullet to hit the plane instead. The damaged plane falls and Wallace jumps to grab Gromit, sacrificing himself to break his fall into a cheese tent. Gromit quickly disguises Victor as the Were-Rabbit, causing Philip and the townspeople to chase him away.\n\nWallace morphs back to his human self and appears dead, but Gromit revives him with [[Stinking Bishop cheese]], undoing the curse of the Were-Rabbit. Tottington awards Gromit the Golden Carrot for his valor, and converts the grounds of Tottington Hall into a [[nature reserve]] for Hutch and the other rabbits.\n\n== Voice cast ==\n{{see also|Wallace and Gromit}}\n[[File:Helena Bonham Carter 2005.jpg|thumb|[[Helena Bonham Carter]] at the film's North American premiere at the [[2005 Toronto International Film Festival]]<ref>{{cite press release|author1=Toronto International Film Festival|title=North American Premiere of Nick Park's and Steve Box's Wallace & Gromit \u2013 The Curse of the Were-Rabbit a Gala Presentation|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/north-american-premiere-of-nick-parks-and-steve-boxs-wallace--gromit---the-curse-of-the-were-rabbit-a-gala-presentation-54901437.html|publisher=PR Newswire|access-date=15 March 2015|date=16 August 2005}}</ref>]]\n* [[Peter Sallis]] as Wallace, an eccentric, absent-minded and accident-prone yet good-natured inventor with a great fondness for [[cheese]], who runs Anti-Pesto with his dog and best friend, Gromit.\n** Sallis also provides the voice of Hutch, a kidnapped rabbit who gradually develops several of Wallace's mannerisms \u2014 his dialogue consists entirely of phrases and statements previously made by Wallace \u2014 after an attempted mind-alteration goes awry and who is at first suspected to be the Were-Rabbit.
