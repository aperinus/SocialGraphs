It is based on [[Michael Crichton]]'s [[Disclosure (novel)|novel of the same name]].<ref>{{cite news|title= Douglas, Moore Star in Adaptation of Crichton's Novel on Harassment Reversal|work= The Los Angeles Times|url= http://articles.latimes.com/1994-12-09/entertainment/ca-14310_1_michael-crichton|access-date=2010-10-24}}</ref> The cast also includes [[Donald Sutherland]], [[Caroline Goodall]] and [[Dennis Miller]]. The film is a combination thriller and slight mystery in an office setting within the computer industry in the mid-1990s. The main focus of the story, from which the film and book take their titles, is the issue of [[sexual harassment]] and its power structure. The film received mixed reviews from critics but was a box office success grossing $214 million against its $50 million budget.\n\n==Plot==\nBob Garvin, founder and CEO of DigiCom, a computer technology company, plans to retire when his company [[mergers and acquisitions|merges]] with a larger company. Production line manager Tom Sanders expects to be promoted to run the [[CD-ROM]] division. Instead, Meredith Johnson, a former girlfriend of Tom's who is responsible for the merger, is promoted to the post, as Garvin wanted to \"break the glass ceiling\" and promote a woman in place of his late daughter.\n\nMeredith calls Tom into her office to discuss some operations regarding problems with the CD-ROM production line in Malaysia, but instead sexually forces herself onto him. He initially reciprocates her desire to engage him in [[oral sex]] but rebuffs her attempts to have full sexual intercourse. Meredith angrily screams a threat towards Tom for spurning her as he leaves. Later that night, Meredith calls Tom's home and tells his wife tomorrow's meeting starts an hour later than it does, tricking Tom into arriving late, allowing her to take his place in a meeting with the merger partners to discuss the problems with the CD-ROM drives, where Meredith pressured Tom into admitting that he is unaware of the cause of the problems.\n\nTom then discovers that Meredith has filed a [[sexual harassment]] complaint against Tom with legal counsel Philip Blackburn. To save the merger from a scandal, which will cause Garvin to lose $100 million if the deal is off, DigiCom officials demand that Tom accept reassignment to another location. He will lose his stock options in the new company, his career will be ruined, and he will be jobless if he takes the outplacement, as the other location is scheduled for sale after the merger. Tom receives an anonymous e-mail from \"A Friend\" that directs him to Seattle attorney Catherine Alvarez, who specializes in sexual harassment cases. Tom decides to sue DigiCom, alleging that it was Meredith who harassed him, at the expense of causing animosity with his wife and colleagues. The initial mediation goes badly for Tom as a tearful Meredith repeatedly lies and blames him.\n\nAfter discovering a recording from Tom's phone records of the encounter proving that Meredith's accusation is false, Garvin, who believes the merger will be unsuccessful without Meredith, proposes that if Tom drops the lawsuit, he will not have to transfer, causing Tom to suspect that Meredith's accusations are vulnerable. Tom remembers mis-dialing a number on his cell phone during the encounter with Meredith but not hanging up. This inadvertently left the recording of the incident on a colleague's voicemail. Tom plays the recording at the next meeting and discredits Meredith. DigiCom agrees to a settlement calling for Meredith to quietly be eased out following the merger.\n\nAs Tom celebrates his apparent victory, he receives another e-mail from \"A Friend\" warning that all is not what it seems. Tom overhears Phillip telling Meredith that even though Tom won the sexual harassment suit, they will make Tom look incompetent at the next morning's merger conference, with Garvin's support. Since the problems with the CD-ROMs are shown as coming from the Malaysian production line, which is under Tom's responsibility, he can be fired as the cause of these problems. Tom attempts to look for clues in the company database, but his access privileges have been revoked. He remembers that the merging company's executives have a [[virtual reality]] demonstration machine in a nearby hotel that has access to the company database.\n\nAs he gets into DigiCom's files, he sees that Meredith is deleting them. Tom receives a call from a Malaysian colleague who is able to fax Tom copies of incriminating memos and videos. They show that Meredith and one of the head of operations in Malaysia agreed to change the production specifications that Tom had laid down, without his knowledge, to gain favor with the Malaysian government and to cut costs for the upcoming merger. Because of Meredith's complete lack of technical expertise and knowledge, the production changes ordered by her resulted in the problems afflicting the CD-ROMs that Tom is responsible for. In an attempt to save the merger that she had created and unwilling to take any responsibility, Meredith had set up the sexual encounter between her and Tom to falsely accuse him of sexual harassment to force him out of DigiCom so she could blame him for the changes, with Blackburn's support, while covering up and blaming the CD-ROM problems on him.\n\nWhen Tom makes his presentation at the conference, Meredith brings up the production problems, but he is now able to publicly show the evidence exposing her direct involvement in causing defects with the hardware. After Meredith angrily accuses Tom of mounting a last-ditch effort of revenge while trying to justify her decisions involving the changes and continuing to blame him for poor decisions, Garvin realizes the full extent of her incompetence and has no other option but to fire her. Garvin subsequently announces that the merger has been completed and then names Stephanie Kaplan to head up the Seattle operation, a decision that Tom is pleased with, especially when she publicly highlights his contributions and says that she is relying on him to be her right-hand man going forward.\n\nTom subsequently asks Stephanie's son, Spencer, if he knows \"A Friend\". Spencer says he is the research assistant of Professor Arthur Friend at the University of Washington. Tom realizes that Spencer had access to Friend's office computer, enabling Stephanie (via her son) to have previously warned him as \"A Friend\" when he was in trouble, and that she knew exactly everything that was going on involving the CD-ROM Drives and Meredith. A gratified Tom is happy to resume his position as the Head of Manufacturing.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Michael Douglas]] as Tom Sanders\n* [[Demi Moore]] as Meredith Johnson\n* [[Donald Sutherland]] as Bob Garvin\n* [[Caroline Goodall]] as Susan Sanders\n* [[Dennis Miller]] as Mark Lewyn\n* [[Roma Maffia]] as Catherine Alvarez\n* [[Dylan Baker]] as Philip Blackburn\n* [[Rosemary Forsyth]] as Stephanie Kaplan\n* [[Suzie Plakson]] as Mary Anne Hunter\n* [[Nicholas Sadler]] as Don Cherry\n* [[Jacqueline Kim]] as Cindy Chang\n* [[Kate Williamson]] as Judge Barbara Murphy\n* [[Donal Logue]] as Chance Geer\n* [[Farrah Forke]] as Adele Lewyn\n* [[Allan Rich]] as Ben Heller\n* David Drew Gallagher as Spencer Kaplan\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n[[Michael Crichton]] sold the movie rights for $1 million before the novel was published.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book |last=Eliot |first=Marc |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z8hvDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA204 |title=Michael Douglas: A Biography |publisher=Crown |year=2013 |isbn=978-0-3079-5237-0 |pages=204}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |date=January 16, 1994 |title=Harassment On The Tech Highway |work=[[Chicago Tribune]] |url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1994-01-16-9401160054-story.html |url-status=dead |access-date=July 27, 2022 |archive-url=http://archive.today/2022.07.27-213136/https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1994-01-16-9401160054-story.html |archive-date=July 27, 2022}}</ref> [[Milo\u0161 Forman]] was originally attached to direct but left due to creative differences with Crichton.<ref name=\":0\" /> [[Barry Levinson]] and [[Alan J.
