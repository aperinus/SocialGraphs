It stars [[Ray Winstone]], [[Ben Kingsley]], and [[Ian McShane]]. It follows Gary \"Gal\" Dove (Winstone), a retired ex-gangster visited by a violent gangster (Kingsley) who demands that he take part in a [[bank robbery|bank job]].\n\n''Sexy Beast'' was critically acclaimed and Kingsley's performance earned him an [[Academy Award|Oscar]] nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Supporting Actor]].<ref>{{cite news |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=Sir Ben's Sexy honour |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/film/1734960.stm |work=[[BBC News]] |date=31 December 2001 |access-date=4 February 2008}}</ref> In 2004, ''[[Total Film]]'' named ''Sexy Beast'' the 15th best [[Cinema of the United Kingdom|British film]].\n\n==Plot==\nThe British ex-criminal Gary \"Gal\" Dove is happily retired in Spain with his beloved wife DeeDee, best friend Aitch, and Aitch's wife Jackie. An old criminal associate, the feared sociopath Don Logan, arrives at Gal's villa, intent on enlisting Gal for a bank robbery in London planned by crimelord Teddy Bass. Teddy has learned about the bank vault from Harry, the bank's chairman, whom he met at an orgy. Gal politely declines, but Don continues to pressure Gal, growing increasingly aggressive and violent.\n\nAfter Gal suggests Don's real reason for visiting is his infatuation with Jackie, with whom he had a brief affair, Don grows furious and leaves for England. On the plane, Don refuses to extinguish his cigarette prior to takeoff, is aggressive to staff and other passengers, and is ejected. He returns to the villa screaming obscenities and attacks Gal with a bottle; DeeDee aims Gal's shotgun at Don, and the group shoot and beat him to death.\n\nIn London, Gal prepares for the heist. Teddy questions Gal about Don's whereabouts; Gal claims Don returned to London and called him from [[London Heathrow Airport|Heathrow Airport]]. The heist involves using diving gear to drill into the bank vault from a pool in a neighbouring bath house. The pool water floods the vault and shorts its security system. As Teddy's crew empties the vault's [[safe deposit box]]es, Gal secretly pockets a pair of ruby earrings encrusted with diamonds.\n\nAfter the job, Teddy insists on driving Gal to the airport. He stops at Harry's home, where he kills Harry and demands again that Gal tell him where Don is. Gal responds that he is \"not into this any more\". In the car, Teddy suggests he might visit Gal in Spain sometime, humiliates him by paying him only \u00a310 for the job, and implies more serious threats.\n\nGal returns to his friends and family in Spain, where DeeDee wears the earrings and life has returned to normal. Gal still hears Don's voice in his head; he responds that Don is dead now and can shut up.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Ray Winstone]] as Gary 'Gal' Dove, a retired criminal who married DeeDee and moved to Spain to start a new life\n* [[Ben Kingsley]] as Don Logan, a violent sociopath and recruiter for the London underworld\n* [[Ian McShane]] as Teddy Bass, a London crime boss \n* [[Amanda Redman]] as DeeDee Dove, Gal's beloved wife and a former porn star\n* [[James Fox]] as Harry, a banker who shows Bass the vault\n* [[Cavan Kendall]] as Aitch, Dove's best friend\n* Julianne White as Jackie, Aitch's wife, who had a fling with Logan\n* \u00c1lvaro Monje as Enrique, a Spanish boy who helps Gal around the house\n\n==Production==\nThe producer [[Jeremy Thomas]] remembered his experience making the film:<ref name=\"berlinale\">{{cite web |title=Jeremy Thomas - And I'm still a fan |date=29 October 2010 |url=http://www.berlinale-talents.de/story/89/1789.html |publisher=[[Berlin International Film Festival|Berlinale Talents]] |access-date=18 March 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140604102428/http://www.berlinale-talents.de/story/89/1789.html |archive-date=4 June 2014 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n{{blockquote|''Sexy Beast'' was the beginning of a new phase for me of working with first-time filmmakers. Jonathan Glazer was a television commercials director in the UK, and a wonderful talent. We were sent this script which he was attached to, and out came this wonderful film. It was very stimulating having a first time talent... The dialogue as you see in this film is exceptional. I had never read a script like it, and I thought, this has got to be made. It was very difficult to get insurance on the film actually. When the American studio bought the film, their legal department said: \"You cannot make this.\" It has something like 300 uses of the word \"cunt\", and 400 \"fucks\", but somehow it passed the censorship and got out there.}}\n\n==Reception==\n{{As of|2022|01}}, the film has an approval rating of 87% on [[Rotten Tomatoes]], based on 137 reviews with an average rating of 7.30/10.
