It is a [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] from the 2003 film ''[[Daredevil (film)|Daredevil]]'', starring the [[Marvel Comics]] character [[Elektra (comics)|Elektra Natchios]] (portrayed by [[Jennifer Garner]]). The story follows Elektra, an assassin who must protect a man and his prodigy daughter from another assassin who was hired by [[The Hand (comics)|The Hand]].\n\nFor the screenplay, [[Zak Penn]], Stuart Zicherman, and [[Raven Metzner]] received \"written by\" credit. [[Mark Steven Johnson]] received credit for \"motion picture characters\" and [[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller]] for \"comic book characters\". Filming started around May 2004 in [[Vancouver]].<ref>{{cite web |last =Keck |first= William |title= For '13' rollout, 'cute' sums it up |url= http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/movies/news/2004-04-15-13-is-cute_x.htm |work= [[USA Today]] |access-date= January 8, 2013 |date= April 15, 2004 }}</ref>\n\nThe film was released on January 14, 2005. Upon its release, ''Elektra'' was a commercial and critical failure, grossing $56 million against a production budget of $43\u201365 million. It received negative reviews from critics, who found the script and storyline lacking, but many praised Garner's performance.<ref>{{cite web |date= August 6, 2016 |author= Graeme McMillan |title= Never Mind 'Suicide Squad,' Here Are the Worst 20 Superhero Movies Ever (According to Critics) |url= https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/worst-superhero-movies-all-time-917766 |website= [[The Hollywood Reporter]] |access-date= 2019-10-28 }}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nAfter being killed in ''[[Daredevil (film)|Daredevil]]'', [[Elektra (character)|Elektra Natchios]] is revived by blind [[martial arts]] master [[Stick (comics)|Stick]]. He teaches her the ancient art of Kimagure, which provides its practitioners with [[precognition]] as well as the ability to resurrect the dead. Elektra is expelled from the training compound because of her inability to let go of her rage and fear of seeing her mother's killer as a child. She leaves and uses her training to become a contract killer.\n\nYears later, McCabe, Elektra's agent, receives an unusually large offer from an anonymous client wishing to hire Elektra. The only stipulation: she must spend a few days in a rented home on the island where the assassination is to be performed before the names of the targets are revealed. During the wait, Elektra catches a girl named Abby trying to steal her mother's necklace. She sends her away, and later meets and befriends her father, Mark Miller. Abby invites Elektra to dinner on Mark's behalf. Elektra develops a romantic interest in Mark but soon learns that he and Abby are the targets she has been hired to kill. Elektra spares them and leaves, but returns in time to protect them from assassins sent by [[The Hand (comics)|The Hand]], a crime syndicate of [[ninja]] mercenaries.\n\nRoshi, master of The Hand, learns of the failed attempt and permits his son [[Kirigi]] to lead a new team of assassins to kill Elektra and return with Abby, referred to as \"The Treasure\". Elektra tries to leave Abby and Mark with Stick, but he scolds her and tells her to protect them herself. She takes Mark and Abby to McCabe's country house, but is followed by Kirigi, [[Typhoid Mary (comics)|Typhoid]], [[Stone (Marvel Comics)|Stone]], Kinkou, and [[Tattoo (comics)|Tattoo]]. Elektra flees with Mark and Abby through a secret underground exit to an orchard, while McCabe sacrifices himself to buy them time.\n\nKirigi and the assassins hunt down the trio in the orchard. Elektra kills Stone, while Abby and Mark kill Kinkou with one of his own daggers. As Elektra is distracted by the revelation that Abby has martial arts skills, Typhoid gives Elektra the \"Kiss of Death\". Abby is captured by Kirigi. Stick and his [[Chaste (Marvel Comics)|Chaste ninjas]] arrive, forcing Kirigi, Typhoid, and Tattoo to retreat. Stick saves Elektra from death and takes them under his protection.\n\nStick confirms that Abby is the \"Treasure\", a martial arts prodigy, whom the Hand seeks to use. Elektra learns that she was a Treasure herself, resulting in her mother becoming a casualty of the fight between The Chaste and The Hand. She also guesses that Stick set up the hit on Mark and Abby in order to test Elektra's propensity for compassion.\n\nElektra [[Astral projection|astrally projects]] herself to a meeting with Kirigi and challenges him to a fight, the winner claiming Abby for their own purpose. Elektra returns to her childhood home to face Kirigi and realizes that the horned demon who killed her mother was actually Kirigi.\n\nElektra is defeated by Kirigi. Abby arrives and engages him long enough for Elektra to recuperate. Elektra and Abby then escape and hide in a [[hedge maze]], but Abby is captured by snakes dispatched by Tattoo. Elektra finds Tattoo and snaps his neck, releasing Abby. Elektra engages Kirigi a second time and kills him. Typhoid poisons and kills Abby, before Elektra throws her [[Sai (weapon)|sai]] at Typhoid, killing her. Elektra desperately tries to wake Abby, then calms herself, lets go all of her rage, and successfully resurrects her using Kimagure.\n\nElektra gets ready to leave. She and Mark share one final kiss. Elektra tells Abby to live a normal life and that they each gave each other's life back. Elektra leaves, hoping that Abby won't grow up to be like her. Stick appears and points out that Elektra didn't turn out so bad. Elektra bows to Stick to thank him. He bows to Elektra, then disappears.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Jennifer Garner]] as [[Elektra (character)|Elektra Natchios]]\n** Laura Ward as Young Elektra\n* [[Terence Stamp]] as [[Stick (comics)|Stick]]\n* [[Goran Vi\u0161nji\u0107]] as Mark Miller\n* [[Kirsten Prout]] as Abby Miller\n* [[Will Yun Lee]] as [[Kirigi]]\n* [[Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa]] as Roshi\n* [[Colin Cunningham]] as McCabe\n* [[Hiro Kanagawa]] as Meizumi\n* [[Natassia Malthe]] as [[Typhoid Mary (comics)|Typhoid]]\n* [[Bob Sapp]] as [[Stone (Marvel Comics)|Stone]]\n* Chris Ackerman as [[Tattoo (comics)|Tattoo]]\n* Edison T.

After selling the rights of Elektra to [[New Line Cinema]], [[Frank Miller]] was hired to pen a screenplay based on the graphic novel of the same name. Later on, screenwriters [[Jim McBride]] and [[L.M. Kit Carson]] were hired to write a second script. Director [[Oliver Stone]] later signed on to direct and wanted volleyball player, model, and actress [[Gabrielle Reece]] to star as Elektra. The project was later cancelled after the rights to Elektra was sold to [[20th Century Fox]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2022}}\n\nGarner reportedly did not want to do the film and only did it because she was legally required due to contractual obligations from ''[[Daredevil (film)|Daredevil]]''.<ref>{{cite web | date = January 27, 2005 | title = Jennifer Garner deemed 'Elektra' awful | work = [[San Francisco Chronicle]] | url = https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Jennifer-Garner-deemed-Elektra-awful-Penelope-2702759.php }}<!-- unable to find the US Weekly interview with Vartan that this is based on --></ref> The film was made during Jennifer Garner's hiatus from the television show ''[[Alias (TV series)|Alias]]'', and production was limited by that timeframe.<ref name=\"ign-bowman\" /> [[Ben Affleck]] reprised his role as [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Matt Murdock / Daredevil]] in a cameo appearance, but it was cut from the final film.
