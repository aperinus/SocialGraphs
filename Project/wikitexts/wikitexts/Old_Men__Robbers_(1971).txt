The official version is that Myachikov has solved no crimes for the last two months, but the real reason is that Fedyaev's boss wants Myachikov's position to go to another man, Proskudin. Fedyaev gives Myachikov a month to show he should not lose his job. Myachikov's best friend, engineer Valentin Vorobyov, is also due to retire but wants to stay on. He suggests to Myachikov that they set up the biggest crime ever and then solve it together so they will be allowed to continue working. Their first idea is to steal a [[Rembrandt]] painting from a museum. The plan fails when no one notices that the canvas is missing, believing the note the thieves left saying it has been removed for restoration. With great difficulty, Myachikov and Vorobyov sneak the picture back. Their next plan is to enlist the help of Myachikov's neighbour, Anna Pavlovna, a bank employee. Their plan to stage a robbery and pretend to recover the loot goes away when an actual robber intervenes. The trio struggle to understand what has happened, how to make restitution, and return to their honest lives.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Yuri Nikulin]] \u2014 ''Nikolay Sergeevitch Myachikov''\n*[[Yevgeny Yevstigneyev]] \u2014 ''Valentin Petrovich Vorobyov''\n* [[Olga Aroseva]] \u2014 ''Anna Pavlovna Suzdaleva''\n* [[Georgi Burkov]] \u2014 ''Fyodor Fyodorovitch Fedyaev''\n* [[Andrei Mironov (actor)|Andrei Mironov]] \u2014 ''Yury Yevgenyevitch Proskudin''\n* [[Valentina Vladimirova]] \u2014 ''Masha, Vorobyov's wife''\n* [[Yuri Belov (actor)|Yuri Belov]] \u2014 ''Petya, militsiaman''\n* [[Valentina Talyzina]] \u2014 ''Fedyaev's secretary''\n* [[Roman Filippov]] \u2014 ''robber''\n* [[Nina Agapova]] \u2014 ''museum keeper''\n* [[Irina Murzaeva]] \u2014 ''old museum keeper''\n* [[Lev Durov]] \u2014 ''driver of the collector car ''\n* [[Boris Runge]] \u2014 ''shoes shop director''\n* [[Gotlib Roninson]] \u2014 ''doctor''\n* [[Yuri Smirnov (actor)|Yuri Smirnov]] \u2014 ''locksmith''\n* [[Georgi Kulikov (actor)|Georgi Kulikov]] \u2014 ''Vorobyov's colleague''\n* [[Viktor Bajkov]] \u2014 ''Vorobyov's colleague''\n* [[Yevgeni Perov]] \u2014 ''Vorobyov's colleague''\n* [[Natalya Sajko]] \u2014 ''Vorobyov's colleague''\n* {{Interlanguage link|Boris Vladimirov (actor)|lt=Boris Vladimirov|ru|\u0412\u043b\u0430\u0434\u0438\u043c\u0438\u0440\u043e\u0432, \u0411\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0441 \u041f\u0430\u0432\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447}} \u2014 ''Vorobyov's colleague''\n* [[Aleksandr Shirvindt]] \u2014 ''spokesman of the minister''\n* [[Eldar Ryazanov]] \u2014 ''Myachikov's colleague''\n* [[Yuriy Yakovlev (Soviet actor)|Yuri Yakovlev]] \u2014 ''narrator (voice)''\n\n== External links ==\n*{{IMDb title|0067789}}\n*{{Amg movie|136387}}\n\n{{Eldar Ryazanov}}\n\n[[Category:1972 films]]\n[[Category:1972 comedy-drama films]]\n[[Category:1970s crime comedy films]]\n[[Category:1970s heist films]]\n[[Category:Mosfilm films]]\n[[Category:1970s Russian-language films]]\n[[Category:Films set in museums]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Lviv]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Moscow]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Eldar Ryazanov]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Andrey Petrov]]\n[[Category:Soviet comedy-drama films]]\n[[Category:Russian comedy-drama films]]\n\n\n{{1970s-USSR-film-stub}}\n{{1970s-comedy-film-stub}}"}]}}}}
