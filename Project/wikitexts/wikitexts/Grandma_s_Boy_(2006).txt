The film features a video game tester who is forced to move in with his grandmother after being evicted from his home while falling for a woman who was sent to oversee the production of his video game company's newest video game.\n\n==Plot==\nAlex is a single, 35-year-old video game tester who lives with his friend Josh. When Josh wastes their rent money on [[Filipino people|Filipino]] hookers, their landlord Yuri evicts them, purposely breaks one of their bongs, and has his movers trash everything that doesn't belong to them, forcing Alex to find a new place to live.\n\nAlex tries to stay with his marijuana dealer Dante, but cannot do so because Dante is adopting a wild [[lion]] to live in the house. Alex spends one night with his co-worker Jeff, but Jeff still lives with his parents. After an embarrassing \"encounter\" with Jeff's mother in which he is caught [[masturbating]] in the bathroom and subsequently ejaculates on her, she still allows Alex to stay with them, but he has the option of moving in with his grandmother Lilly and her two eccentric friends Bea and Grace.\n\nAlex is given many chores and fix-up projects to do around the house, but has a hard time completing them because his grandmother and her friends are a constant distraction. He also finds it hard to get any work done. Alex discovers that the three women have a fascination with the television program ''[[Antiques Roadshow (U.S. TV series)|Antiques Roadshow]]'' and later is able to get some work finished by giving them tickets to attend a taping of the show.\n\nAt work, Alex meets the beautiful Samantha, who has been sent by the company's corporate office to oversee the production of a new video game. Alex and Samantha hit it off, but the only person in the way of their relationship is the creator of the game they are all working on, J.P., a self-proclaimed \"genius\" who is obsessed with video games and has a crush on Samantha. Samantha is not interested in J.P. and declines his constant advances.\n\nMeanwhile, in an attempt to sound cool to his younger co-workers, Alex says that he is living \"with three hot babes\". Alex's friends believe the lie and actually think the reason he is so tired every day at work is because he is living with three women who constantly \"wear him out\" in the bedroom. The real cause of his fatigue is because he stays up late at night working on his own video game called ''Demonik'' which he has been developing in secret for some time. Lilly asks about the game one night and he teaches her to play it. To his surprise, she becomes quite good at it and beats many levels.\n\nAfter Alex and his co-workers finish successfully testing ''Eternal Death Slayer 3'', their boss Mr. Cheezle tells Samantha to take the boys out to eat at a vegan restaurant, but they instead make fun of the restaurant and their waiter Shilo when they arrive, and then leave to a burger shop. When Jeff has to use the bathroom and refuses to use the one in the restaurant, Alex is forced to take everyone to his house.\n\nAlex comes home to find that Lilly, Grace, and Bea drank all of his pot, which they thought was tea. When Samantha admits to smoking weed too, Alex calls up Dante and throws a wild party. During the party, the group prank-calls J.P. and leaves him a voicemail that makes fun of him about wanting to be a robot. J.P. is upset by the message and shows up at Lilly's house a couple nights later in tears. Feeling bad for him, Alex agrees to let him borrow his only copy of ''Demonik'' and test it out for a few days.\n\nIn retaliation for Alex making his life miserable, and having become accustomed to stealing others' ideas, J.P. steals the game and tries to pass it off as his own at work. Mr. Cheezle does not believe Alex when he insists the game is his since it was his only copy, so his friends call Lilly to the office. Because she has mastered the game already, she plays J.P. and wins to prove it belongs to Alex.\n\nJ.P. is fired by Mr. Cheezle while Alex is vindicated and creates a successful game. Alex and Samantha start dating.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Allen Covert]] as Alex, a video game tester.\n* [[Linda Cardellini]] as Samantha, a woman sent to oversee the development of a video game who Alex falls for.\n* [[Doris Roberts]] as Grandma Lilly, Alex's grandmother.\n* [[Shirley Jones]] as Grace, a friend of Lilly who lives with her.\n* [[Shirley Knight]] as Bea, a friend of Lilly who lives with her.\n* [[Peter Dante]] as Dante Spirou, a marijuana dealer.\n* [[Nick Swardson]] as Jeff, Alex's co-worker. \n* [[Joel David Moore|Joel Moore]] as J.P., a video game tester and self-proclaimed genius who is Alex's rival.\n* [[Kevin Nealon]] as Mr. Simon Cheezle, the boss of Alex.\n* [[Jonah Hill]] as Barry, a younger co-worker of Alex.\n* [[Kelvin Yu]] as Kane, a younger co-worker of Alex. \n* Chuck Church as Dan\n* [[Jonathan Loughran]] as Josh, a friend and former roommate of Alex.\n* [[Scott Halberstadt]] as Bobby\n* [[Rob Schneider]] as Yuri, a Russian landlord who evicts Alex and Josh.\n* [[David Spade]] as Shiloh, a waiter at a vegan restaurant.\n* Randal Reeder as Biker\n* Abdoulaye N'Gom as Dr. Shakalu\n* Todd Holland and [[Kevin Nash]] as two unnamed movers who work for Yuri.\n* [[Stryker (disc jockey)|Ted Stryker]] as the restaurant host of a vegan restaurant.\n* Harry the Chimp as Dante's pet chimpanzee\n* [[Frank Coraci]] (''uncredited'') as Cousin Steven{{Cn|date=September 2022}}\n}}\n\n==Production==\n[[Principal photography]] took place in [[Los Angeles]] at L.A.
