The two birds start squabbling, and are gradually joined by 13 others of the same species, all squabbling for space.\n\nA large, awkward [[heron]]-like bird honks and waves at them from a nearby telephone pole, interrupting the squabble. The 15 little birds start imitating his plumage and honk, mockingly, until the bigger bird again calls to them, causing the little birds to scoot further down the wire and quietly gossip about it.\n\nUndeterred, the bigger bird flies and perches between the flock of smaller birds, but his weight causes the powerline to sag almost to the ground. The smaller birds slide down and are squished together against the big bird's sides, one angrily pecking the big bird and making him fall over backwards, hanging upside down. Egged on by the others, the two little birds in the middle start pecking the big bird's toes, which release one-by-one from the wire. One little bird realizes what is about to happen, and warns the others. They stop too late, and the last toe of the big bird releases, snapping the wire like a [[slingshot]] and flinging the little birds up in a cloud of feathers.\n\nThe bigger bird lands unharmed on the ground, and plays with the floating feathers until one of the smaller birds, now naked, crashes beside him. He sees the naked little bird and laughs at him, offering a leaf for coverage. Later, the other little birds land nearby, also naked. The big bird laughs even harder at the little birds, who quickly hide behind him in shame. The film ends with a splat of bird droppings containing the words \"the end\" landing on the screen.\n\n==Accolades==\n''For the Birds'' won the following awards:\n*2000: [[74th Academy Awards]]\u2014[[Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film|Best Short Animated Film]]<ref name=Oscars /><ref>[https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=BOO0bn8qVlU For The Birds Wins Animated Short Film: 2002 Oscars]</ref>\n*2001: Vancouver Effects and Animation Festival\u2014Animated Computer 3D Short\n*2001: Anima Mundi Animation Festival\u2014Best Film x2\n*2001: Chicago International Children's Film Festival-Short Film or Video\u2014Animation\u2014Second Place\n*2000: [[Annie Award]]\u2014[[Annie Award for Best Animated Short Subject|Outstanding Achievement in an Animated Short Subject]]\n*2000: [[Sitges]]\u2014Catalan International Film Festival\u2014Best Animated Short Film\n\n[[File:Installation of For the Birds memorial (29).jpg|thumb|A ''For the Birds'' sculpture in [[Vasylkiv]], [[Ukraine]]]]\n\n==Easter eggs==\nA reference to ''For the Birds'' was put in the 2006 Disney\u2013Pixar movie ''[[Cars (film)|Cars]]''.
