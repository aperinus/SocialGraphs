It is the second theatrical film in [[The Muppets (franchise)|''The Muppets'' franchise]]. In addition to the Muppet performers, the film stars [[Charles Grodin]] and [[Diana Rigg]] with special appearances by [[John Cleese]], [[Robert Morley]], [[Peter Ustinov]], and [[Jack Warden]]. The film was produced by [[ITC Entertainment]] and [[The Jim Henson Company]] and distributed by [[Universal Pictures]]. In the plot, the Muppets are caught up in a jewel heist while investigating a robbery in London.\n\nThe film was released by [[Universal Pictures]] and [[Associated Film Distribution]] on 26 June 1981 in the United States and on 30 July 1981 in the United Kingdom. It is the only Muppets feature film directed by Henson. Shot in the United Kingdom and [[London]] in 1980, the film was released shortly after the final season of ''[[The Muppet Show]]''.\n\n==Plot==\n[[Kermit the Frog]] and [[Fozzie Bear]] are investigative reporters for the ''Daily Chronicle'' newspaper\u2014they are supposedly identical twins, which becomes the source of a [[running gag]]: nobody can tell they are twins unless Fozzie is wearing his hat. [[Gonzo (Muppet)|Gonzo the Great]] is their loyal photographer, and together they make a team. One day, after the trio is dismissed for failing to report on a major jewel robbery, Kermit asks their editor Mr. Tarkanian to allow them to travel to London to investigate the robbery and interview the victim, the prominent [[fashion design]]er Lady Holiday. [[Statler and Waldorf]] make appearances throughout the film to heckle them and the audience.\n\nWith only $12 for the trip, they are forced to travel in an airplane baggage hold and are literally thrown out of the plane as it passes over Britain. They stay at the dilapidated (but free) Happiness Hotel, which is populated by other Muppet characters, including [[Dr. Teeth and the Electric Mayhem]], [[Scooter (Muppet)|Scooter]], the [[Swedish Chef]], [[Bunsen Honeydew|Dr. Bunsen Honeydew]], [[Beaker (Muppet)|Beaker]], [[List of Muppets#Lew Zealand|Lew Zealand]], [[Rowlf the Dog]], [[Sam Eagle|Sam the Eagle]], [[List of Muppets#Pops|Pops]], [[List of Muppets#Beauregard|Beauregard]], [[List of Muppets#Crazy Harry|Crazy Harry]], [[List of Muppets#Camilla the Chicken|Camilla the Chicken]], and [[Rizzo the Rat]]. The next morning, when Kermit seeks out Lady Holiday in her office, he finds her newly hired receptionist, the alluring [[Miss Piggy]], and mistakes her for the fashion designer. Piggy instantly falls in love with the little green reporter. She poses as Lady Holiday, and Kermit asks her out for dinner; to keep up the pose, she allows Kermit to assume she lives at a \"highbrow\" address. She sneaks into a townhouse at 17 Highbrow Street to wait for him (much to the surprise of the actual upper-class British residents), and they go out to the Dubonnet Club for dinner.\n\nAt the nightclub, the real Lady Holiday's necklace is stolen by her jealous brother Nicky and his accomplices Carla, Marla, and Darla, three of her exploited fashion models (the very same thieves who robbed her before). After the robbery, Miss Piggy's charade is revealed and she flees, leaving Kermit behind. The next day; in a London park, they reconcile after having a brief argument. Despite Nicky's instant attraction to Miss Piggy, he and his accomplices frame her for the necklace theft during Lady Holiday's fashion show. They plan to steal an even more valuable prize: Lady Holiday's largest and most valuable jewel, the Fabulous Baseball Diamond, now on display at the Mallory Gallery. Unbeknownst to them, Gonzo overhears their plot. He, Kermit, Fozzie, and the other residents of the Happiness Hotel decide to intercept the thieves and catch them red-handed to exonerate Miss Piggy. Kermit arrives at the prison to explain the plan to Piggy, while being disguised as her \"lawyer\".\n\nThe Muppets sneak into the Mallory Gallery and get to the Baseball Diamond at the same time as the thieves. They try to keep the diamond out of the thieves' hands via a game of [[keep away]], but Nicky eventually catches the diamond and takes Kermit hostage at gunpoint. In the meantime, Piggy escapes from prison, and she races to the gallery, crashing through the window on a motorcycle that serendipitously fell off a truck in front of her. She knocks Nicky out and dispatches Carla, Marla and Darla with a flurry of furious karate chops. As the police arrive, all charges against Piggy are dropped, Nicky and his accomplices are arrested, and the Muppets get their deserved credit for foiling the heist.\n\nThe Muppets then return to the United States the same way they departed, being thrown out of the cargo hold and parachuting back.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Diana Rigg]] as Lady Holiday, a famous British fashion designer who has been the victim of a jewel heist\n* [[Charles Grodin]] as Nicky Holiday, Lady Holiday's brother\n* [[Michael Robbins]] as Henderson, the Mallory Gallery's security guard\n* [[Joan Sanderson]] as Dorcas, Neville's wife\n* [[Peter Hughes (actor)|Peter Hughes]] as Stanley, a [[Ma\u00eetre d'h\u00f4tel|ma\u00eetre d']] at the Dubonnet Club\n* [[Peggy Aitchison]] as a prison guard\n* [[Tommy Godfrey]] as a bus conductor\n* [[Erica Creer]] as Marla, Nicky's henchwoman.\n* [[Kate Howard (actress)|Kate Howard]] as Carla, Nicky's henchwoman.\n* [[Della Finch]] as Darla, Nicky's henchwoman.\n\n===Cameo guest stars===\n* [[John Cleese]] as Neville, a rich British homeowner\n* [[Robert Morley]] as a British gentleman\n* [[Peter Ustinov]] as a truck driver, who has his truck stolen by [[Miss Piggy]]\n* [[Jack Warden]] as Mike Tarkanian, the editor-in-chief of ''The Daily Chronicle''\n* [[Peter Falk]] makes an uncredited cameo in the film.\n\n===Muppet performers===\n* [[Jim Henson]] as [[Kermit the Frog]], [[Rowlf the Dog]], [[Dr. Teeth and the Electric Mayhem#Dr. Teeth|Dr. Teeth]], [[Statler and Waldorf|Waldorf]], [[Swedish Chef|The Swedish Chef]] and [[List of Muppets#The Newsman|The Muppet Newsman]]\n* [[Frank Oz]] as [[Miss Piggy]], [[Fozzie Bear]], [[Dr. Teeth and the Electric Mayhem#Animal|Animal]] and [[Sam Eagle|Sam the Eagle]]\n* [[Dave Goelz]] as [[Gonzo (Muppet)|Gonzo]], [[List of Muppets#Beauregard|Beauregard]], [[Dr. Teeth and the Electric Mayhem#Zoot|Zoot]] and [[Bunsen Honeydew|Dr. Bunsen Honeydew]]\n* [[Jerry Nelson]] as [[Dr. Teeth and the Electric Mayhem#Floyd Pepper|Floyd Pepper]], [[List of Muppets#Pops|Pops]], [[List of Muppets#Lew Zealand|Lew Zealand]] and [[List of Muppets|Louis Kazagger]]\n* [[Richard Hunt (puppeteer)|Richard Hunt]] as [[Scooter (Muppet)|Scooter]], [[Statler and Waldorf|Statler]], [[List of Muppets#Sweetums|Sweetums]], [[Dr. Teeth and the Electric Mayhem#Janice|Janice]] and [[Beaker (Muppet)|Beaker]]\n* [[Steve Whitmire]] as [[Rizzo the Rat]] and [[Dr. Teeth and the Electric Mayhem#Lips|Lips]]\n* [[Louise Gold]] as Annie Sue and Lou\n* [[Kathryn Mullen]] as Gaffer the Cat\n* [[Caroll Spinney]] as [[Oscar the Grouch]]\n\n==Release==\n''The Great Muppet Caper'' was theatrically released on 26 June 1981 in the United States and on 30 July 1981 in the United Kingdom.

Instead, they ship them to England and dump them into a basic caper plot, treating them every bit as much like a formula as [[James Bond in film|James Bond]].\" He concluded his review by stating that \"the lack of a cutting edge hurts this movie.

However, he felt the film suffers \"from a case of the we-know-we're-cute-so-we-can-get-by-with-anything disease.

Their screen time is usually limited (often to just a cameo) and tends to consist of playing second banana to the Jim Henson-birthed lunacy.
