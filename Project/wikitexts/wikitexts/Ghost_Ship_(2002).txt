The film follows a [[marine salvage]] crew in the [[Bering Sea]] who discover a mysterious ocean liner that disappeared in 1962. Despite its title, the film is unrelated to the 1952 film [[Ghost Ship (1952 film)|of the same name]].\n\nThe film was shot in [[Queensland]], [[Australia]] and [[Vancouver|Vancouver, British Columbia]], [[Canada]], and released theatrically in North America on October 25, 2002. It received largely negative reviews from critics and grossed $68 million worldwide.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1962, aboard the Italian ocean liner ''MS Antonia Graza'', passengers dance to the song \"[[Senza Fine]]\" sung by Francesca. A young girl, Katie, sits alone until the ship's captain offers to dance with her. A hand lifts a lever that tightens a wire cord. The wire snaps and whips across the dance floor, bisecting the passengers and crew. Katie is spared as the captain pushes her down out of the wire's path, though he is killed.\n\nForty years later, a salvage crew \u2014 Captain Sean Murphy, Maureen Epps, Greer, Dodge, Munder and Santos \u2014 are approached by Jack Ferriman, a weather service pilot who spotted a vessel adrift in the [[Bering Sea]]. It can be claimed by whoever brings it to port. The crew sets out on their [[salvage tug]], the ''Arctic Warrior''. The ship is the ''Antonia Graza'', missing since 1962. Boarding the abandoned liner, the salvagers discover nine boxes, each containing twenty-eight 100-oz gold bars ({{convert|2800|oz|tonne|disp=out|abbr=off}}).\n\nAfter a series of supernatural events, the group decides to leave with the gold, but an invisible force sabotages the ''Arctic Warrior'' with a propane gas leak. The tugboat explodes, killing Santos.\n\nWith no other option, the group begins repairing the ''Graza''. Greer encounters the apparition of Francesca, who seduces him into cheating on his fianc\u00e9e, then leads him to fall down an elevator shaft, killing him. Murphy enters the captain's cabin and encounters the ghost of the captain. The captain explains that they recovered the gold from a sinking cruise ship, the ''Lorelei'', along with a sole survivor. Murphy is shown a picture of the survivor, whom he recognizes. He rushes to tell the others but hallucinates and sees everyone as the ghost of the burned Santos, who provokes him into a murderous rage. The others think Murphy has gone mad and lock him in the drained fish tank; Epps later finds him drowned as an invisible force has opened a valve filling the tank with water.\n\nEpps meets Katie's ghost, who reveals what happened on the ''Graza''. The sole survivor of the ''Lorelei'' convinced many of the ''Graza'''s crew to murder their passengers, as well as the captain and officers, for the gold. After murdering the passengers, the crew turned on each other. Francesca killed the officer who survived. The mastermind behind the massacre killed Francesca by releasing a hook which slashed her neck. He then branded her palm with a hook-shaped symbol using only his hands. The man is revealed as Jack Ferriman, the demonic spirit of a deceased sinner tasked with provoking people to sin, then killing them and bringing their souls to Hell. Epps deduces that Ferriman lured the salvage team to the ''Graza'' to repair it and decides to sink it to thwart his plan. Munder is crushed to death under the ship's gears while scuba diving in the flooded engine room. Epps tells Dodge to keep Jack on the ship's bridge while she sets explosives. Ferriman taunts Dodge, mocking him as a coward for never acting on his feelings for Epps, then charges him. Dodge shoots Ferriman with a shotgun and believes Ferriman to be dead.\n\nEpps is setting explosives when she is confronted by Dodge. He tells her he killed Ferriman and that they can salvage the gold to start a life together, but Epps asks why Dodge has not asked her where Munder is. \"Dodge\" morphs into Ferriman, who killed Dodge. Ferriman plans to use the ''Graza'' as a trap to continue collecting souls. As long as the ''Graza'' is kept afloat, the souls of everyone who died aboard the ship will be dragged down when Ferriman fills his quota and returns to Hell. He offers to spare Epps's life in exchange for her not interfering, but she refuses. After a brief fight, Epps detonates the explosives. Ferriman is blown to pieces in the explosion, while Katie helps Epps escape the sinking ship. Katie and the other trapped souls are freed and ascend to Heaven.\n\nEpps is found by a cruise ship and returned to land. As she is loaded into an ambulance, she sees the crates of gold being loaded onto the cruise ship by people who resemble her fellow ''Arctic Warrior'' crew, overseen by a resurrected Ferriman, who glares at her and carries on and she screams as the ambulance doors close.\n\n==Cast== \n<!--Cast in order of end credits-->\n{{Castlist|\n*[[Gabriel Byrne]] as Sean Murphy \n*[[Julianna Margulies]] as Maureen Epps \n*[[Ron Eldard]] as Dodge\n*[[Desmond Harrington]] as Jack Ferriman \n*[[Isaiah Washington]] as Greer \n*[[Alex Dimitriades]] as Santos\n*[[Karl Urban]] as Munder \n*[[Emily Browning]] as Katie Harwood \n*[[Francesca Rettondini]] as Francesca \n*[[Monica Mancini]] as the singing voice of Francesca\n*Boris Brkic as Chief Steward\n*Bob Ruggiero as Captain Ruggiero\n*Iain Gardiner as Purser\n}}\n\n==Production==\n===Writing===\n''Ghost Ship'' first emerged in January 1996 as ''Chimera'', a [[spec script]] by [[Mark Hanlon]].<ref name=\"do\">{{cite web|url=http://www.dailyscript.com/scripts/ghost_ship.html |title=Ghost Ship - by Mark Hanlon - First Draft |publisher=Dailyscript.com |date=January 29, 1953 |access-date=September 24, 2011}}</ref> This script was a relatively bloodless [[psychological thriller]] rather than a vivid [[supernatural horror]] film. Most notably, much of the film's gore is absent from the screenplay. The film would have focused on four members of a salvage crew who end up stranded aboard the ghost vessel they are scuttling (the titular ''Chimera''). Over the course of one night, each member \u2014 due to panic, [[cabin fever]], or supernatural forces \u2014 goes insane and plots to kill the other three.\n\nIn ''Chimera'',<ref name=\"do\" /> Murphy is the \"main killer\" and the ship runs onto some rocks and begins to sink. Murphy and Epps survive until nearly the end but as the ship sinks, Murphy goes off to retrieve gold ingots. The weight of the gold and the time he loses in getting to it leads to Murphy's demise. As in the film, Katie helps Epps escape. Over time, the script underwent rewrites, and the psychological aspects of the script were all jettisoned in favor of making the film a slasher. It has been suggested that \"The cast signed on based on this (original) draft ... and were sadly disappointed to find the script had been radically changed by Joel Silver and associates when they arrived to begin shooting.\"<ref>[http://www.dailyscript.com/scripts/ghost_ship_info.txt First draft screenplay of \"Ghost Ship\" (formerly \"Chimera\" ).]</ref> According to Beck in the newly released directors commentary he mentioned that the [[September 11 attacks]] in the United States inspired the studio to make the film a more definitive fight between good and evil instead of trying to be nuanced about the corruption of man.\n\n===Scale modeling===\nThe idea of filming on a real ship was continually brought up, and a few ships were scouted for the possibility of being used as the ''Antonia Graza''. \"The temptation was always to shoot on the real thing,\" Beck says. \"We actually visited a few [ships] , but every time we thought, 'How are we ever going to get a dolly through this alley? Or down this hallway?' When you're shooting you often have to punch through a wall in order to get the shot you need, and on a steel ship that's impossible. We knew the real thing would be far too limiting.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodjesus.com/ghost_ship_about.htm |title=Ghost Ship: About|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190429191947/http://www.hollywoodjesus.com/ghost_ship_about.htm|archive-date=April 29, 2019}}</ref>\n\nInstead of using an actual ship, Australian visual effects company Photon VFX, who prior had worked on the 2002 film ''[[Scooby-Doo (film)|Scooby-Doo]]'', was hired as the principal contractor for all visual effects. This allowed Warner Bros. to take full advantage of the wide spectrum of services offered including [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]], animation, miniatures, live-action, prosthetics, pyrotechnics and aerial, underwater and motion control cinematography.\n\nThe ''[[SS Andrea Doria]]'' served as the inspiration for the film's ship the ''Antonia Graza''. Photon created a 35-foot 1/20th scale model of the ship, allowing the exterior shots to be a combination of CGI, miniature, and live-action footage.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.awn.com/news/photon-vfx-sets-sail-ghost-ship|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190429162608/https://www.awn.com/news/photon-vfx-sets-sail-ghost-ship|archive-date=April 29, 2019|title=Photon VFX Sets Sail With Ghost Ship|publisher=Animation World Network}}</ref> For certain exterior shots a miniature just wouldn't work, so instead a full-scale forecastle and bow were constructed. \"It was a full-scale replica, so it wouldn't have fit into a studio,\" Walker explains. \"It also needed to have sky backgrounds surrounding it, so we built it on a hill to achieve the desired effect.\"\n\n===Filming===\nPrincipal photography for ''Ghost Ship'' began in January 2002 on location in [[Queensland]], [[Australia]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.warnerbros.com/news/press-releases/principal-photography-commences-%E2%80%9Cghost-ship%E2%80%9D-dark-castle-entertainment-production-warner/|publisher=Warner Bros.|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190429174451/https://www.warnerbros.com/news/press-releases/principal-photography-commences-%E2%80%9Cghost-ship%E2%80%9D-dark-castle-entertainment-production-warner/|archive-date=April 29, 2019|title=Principal Photography Commences on \"Ghost Ship,\" a Dark Castle Entertainment Production for Warner Bros.

There was a lot of pride for ''Ghost Ship'' since it was the largest visual effect contract completely done in Australia to date. Photon VFX filmed a real ocean-liner at sea off the coast of [[New South Wales]], digitally removed the ship, but kept all of its movements, leaving nothing but ocean and sky. Then the tracking data was taken and in-put into a robotic filming system, which then filmed the 35-foot-long (10 m) miniature ship. The digital effects team then added 300 digital extras, in addition to digital water and smoke to make the scene appear as realistic as possible.\n\nThe dramatic scene, which features the derelict ballroom reverting to its former grand self, posed a problem for the effects crew. \"That was the most difficult shot I've ever worked on,\" says Duguid. Filming took place on two different sets, the first being the decrepit ballroom which had been adrift for forty years. The second set was the luxurious ballroom, used in the opening scene with happy party guests having a grand time. \"We were filming on a derelict set and a new set, and we shot 80 layers of that scene on a circular motion control track, each time with different things going on. Some we shot forwards, some backwards, some fast, some slow.\"<ref>{{cite news |last=Molitorisz |first=Sacha |date=December 6, 2002 |title=Water Works |work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |location=Sydney, N.S.W. |id={{ProQuest|363902627}} }}</ref>\n\n==Soundtrack==\n{{Infobox album\n| name       = Ghost Ship: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack\n| type       = soundtrack\n| artist     = [[John Frizzell]]\n| alt        =\n| released   = November 5, 2002\n| recorded   = 2002\n| venue      =\n| studio     =\n| genre      =\n| length     = 73:33\n| label      = [[Var\u00e8se Sarabande]]\n| producer   =\n| misc       = \n}}\n{{Album ratings\n|rev1 = [https://web.archive.org/web/20190430193554/http://www.filmtracks.com/titles/ghost_ship.html Filmtracks]\n|rev1score = 2.92/5\n|rev2 = [https://web.archive.org/web/20190430194205/http://www.movie-wave.net/titles/ghost_ship.html Movie Wave]\n|rev2score = {{rating|2|5}}\n}}\n\nThe soundtrack album for ''Ghost Ship'' was released on November 5, 2002 on [[Var\u00e8se Sarabande]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.soundtrackinfo.com/title/tracks.asp?ghostship |title=Ghost Ship Soundtrack (complete album tracklisting) |publisher=SoundtrackINFO |date=5 November 2002 |access-date=24 September 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/ghost-ship-original-motion-picture-soundtrack-mw0000227196|publisher=All Music|title=Ghost Ship [Original Motion Picture Soundtrack]}}</ref> The songs \"[[Not Falling]]\" by [[Mudvayne]] and \"[[Senza Fine]]\" sung by [[Monica Mancini]] are not part of the soundtrack despite being featured in the film.\n\nThe score is described by [[Filmtracks.com]] as \"tap [dancing] around some old genre cliches while diving head first into others, producing a score with drama, fright, and a slight hint of elegance at times as well.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.filmtracks.com/titles/ghost_ship.html|publisher=[[Filmtracks.com]]|access-date=April 30, 2019|title=Ghost Ship (John Frizzell) Review}}</ref>\n\n==Release==\n''Ghost Ship'' was theatrically released on October 25, 2002.<ref name=mojo/> The theatrical poster for ''Ghost Ship'' is similar to that of the 1980 film ''[[Death Ship (1980 film)|Death Ship]]''.<ref>{{cite book |last=Waddel |first=Calum |title=Jack Hill: The Exploitation and Blaxploitation Master, Film by Film |date=2009 |publisher=[[McFarland & Company]] |isbn=9780786452880 |page=186 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lGP7XxAyxFAC&pg=PA186 |access-date=October 17, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Muir |first=John Kenneth |title=Horror Films of the 1980s, Volume 1 |date=2011 |publisher=McFarland & Company |isbn=9780786455010 |page=82 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VJ1vcmaOd7wC&pg=PA82 |access-date=October 17, 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Promotion===\nWarner Bros. in association with [[Hollywood.com]] sponsored a [[sweepstake]]s to promote the film beginning October 18, 2002, with the final drawing on November 1.
