In his second collaboration with Wan, Patrick Wilson starred alongside Vera Farmiga in the main roles of Ed and Lorraine. Production commenced in [[Wilmington, North Carolina]], in February 2012, and scenes were shot in chronological order.\n\n''The Conjuring'' was released in the United States and Canada on July 19, 2013, by [[Warner Bros. Pictures]] and [[New Line Cinema]]. It received positive reviews from critics, who praised the performances, direction, screenplay, atmosphere, and musical score. It grossed over $319{{nbsp}}million worldwide against its $20{{nbsp}}million budget. A sequel, ''[[The Conjuring 2]]'', was released on June 10, 2016.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1971, Roger and Carolyn Perron move into a farmhouse in [[Harrisville, Rhode Island]], with their five daughters: Andrea, Nancy, Christine, Cindy, and April. Their dog, Sadie, refuses to enter the house and the entrance to a cellar has been boarded up. Paranormal events occur within the first few nights. Every clock in the house stops at 3:07 AM. Sadie is found dead in the morning, and Carolyn wakes up with large bruises. She and Christine both encounter a [[malevolent spirit]].\n\nCarolyn contacts [[demonologist]]s [[Ed and Lorraine Warren]], who have recently investigated a possessed doll called [[Annabelle (doll)|Annabelle]]. The Warrens meet with Carolyn and agree to conduct an initial investigation, during which Lorraine, a [[Clairvoyance|clairvoyant]], sees that dark forces have latched on to the Perron family, and leaving the house will not free them. To gather evidence, they place cameras and bells around the house with the help of their assistant Drew Thomas and police officer Brad Hamilton. Further research reveals that the house once belonged to an accused [[Witchcraft|witch]] named Bathsheba Sherman (a relative of [[Mary Eastey|Mary Towne Eastey]]), who sacrificed her week-old baby to the devil and killed herself in 1863 at 3:07 in the morning after cursing all who take her land. There are reports of numerous murders and suicides through the years in the houses that were built on the property.\n\nOne morning, Bathsheba appears to Carolyn and fully possesses her. That night, the group hears a spirit luring Cindy into the wardrobe, where she reveals a secret passage. Lorraine enters the passage and falls down to the cellar, where she sees the spirit of a woman whom Bathsheba had possessed long ago and used to kill her child. Bathsheba attacks Nancy; the incident is caught on camera. The Warrens conclude it is sufficient evidence to receive authorization from the Catholic Church to perform an [[exorcism]] but Father Gordon explains that approval would have to come directly from the [[Vatican City|Vatican]] because the Perron family aren't members of the church.\n\nThe Warrens' daughter Judy is attacked in the Warrens' own home by Bathsheba. The Perron family take refuge at a motel but Carolyn takes Christine and April back to the house to kill them. Ed, Lorraine, and Brad find Carolyn in the cellar trying to stab Christine. Lorraine warns that if they take Carolyn outside the house, Bathsheba will kill her. They tie Carolyn to a chair and Ed attempts the exorcism himself. Though Carolyn escapes and attempts to kill April, Lorraine is able to call to her by reminding her of a special memory she shared with her family, allowing Ed to complete the exorcism and lift Bathsheba's curse. Returning home, Ed adds the haunted music box from the Perron's home to their room of cursed artifacts that they have collected from past cases.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Vera Farmiga]] as [[Ed and Lorraine Warren|Lorraine Warren]]\n* [[Patrick Wilson (American actor)|Patrick Wilson]] as [[Ed and Lorraine Warren|Ed Warren]]\n* [[Lili Taylor]] as Carolyn Perron\n* [[Ron Livingston]] as Roger Perron\n* [[Shanley Caswell]] as Andrea Perron\n* [[Hayley McFarland]] as Nancy Perron\n* [[Joey King]] as Christine Perron\n* [[Mackenzie Foy]] as Cindy Perron\n* [[Kyla Deaver]] as April Perron\n* [[Shannon Kook]] as Drew Thomas\n* [[John Brotherton]] as Brad Hamilton\n* [[Sterling Jerins]] as Judy Warren\n* Marion Guyot as Georgiana Moran\n* [[Steve Coulter]] as Father Gordon\n* [[Joseph Bishara]] as Bathsheba Sherman\n* Morganna May as Debbie\n* [[Amy Tipton]] as Camilla\n* Zach Pappas as Rick\n* Christof Veillon as Maurice Theriault\n* [[Ed and Lorraine Warren|Lorraine Warren]] as woman in audience (uncredited)\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n\n===Development===\nProducer Tony DeRosa-Grund wrote the original treatment and titled the project ''The Conjuring''.<ref name=\"DL\">{{cite web |url=https://deadline.com/2013/06/whats-in-a-title-the-conjuring-producer-new-line-head-to-arbitration-over-tv-rights/ |title=What's In A Title?
