Miller|Ron Miller]], and written by [[Malcolm Marmorstein]]. Based on the unpublished short story \"Pete's Dragon and the USA (Forever After)\" by [[Seton I. Miller]] and S. S. Field, the film stars [[Sean Marshall (actor)|Sean Marshall]], [[Helen Reddy]], [[Jim Dale]], [[Mickey Rooney]], [[Red Buttons]], [[Jeff Conaway]], [[Shelley Winters]], and the voice of [[Charlie Callas]] as Elliott.\n\nThe project was initially conceived in 1957 as a two-part episode of the ''[[Walt Disney anthology television series#Walt Disney's Disneyland (1954\u20131958)|Disneyland]]'' television series, but it was shelved until it was revived as a musical film in 1975. The film was released on November 3, 1977 to mixed reviews from critics, though some praised the animation. It was a moderate financial success, grossing $18 million over a $10 million budget.\n\nThe film received two nominations at the [[50th Academy Awards]], for musical scoring and original song. [[Capitol Records]] released a single of Reddy performing \"[[Candle on the Water]]\" (with a different arrangement from that in the film) that reached #27 on the [[Adult contemporary|Adult Contemporary]] charts.\n\n== Plot ==\nIn [[New England]] in the early 1900s, an orphan named Pete flees the Gogans, an abusive family, with the assistance of an unseen force he calls Elliott. The family calls for Pete to come back and promise that they will treat him better, while contrastingly expressing their true intentions to punish him severely (\"The Happiest Home in These Hills\"). After they abandon their search, Pete falls asleep. The next morning, Pete awakens and Elliott is revealed to be a large green dragon that can turn invisible (\"I Love You, Too\").\n\nPete and Elliott visit [[Passamaquoddy Bay|Passamaquoddy]], where the unseen Elliott's clumsiness causes Pete to be labeled a source of bad luck. Lampie, the lighthouse keeper, stumbles out of a tavern and encounters Pete. Elliott makes himself visible and Lampie, terrified, runs to the townsfolk (\"I Saw a Dragon\"). They dismiss Lampie's claims as another drunken rant. In a seaside cave, Pete scolds Elliott for causing trouble. As they reconcile, Lampie's daughter Nora appears, warning that Pete is not safe staying there because of the incoming tide. When she realizes he is orphaned and not from the area, she offers him food and shelter at the lighthouse, and the two bond (\u201cIt\u2019s Not Easy\u201d). He learns the story of her fianc\u00e9 Paul, whose ship was reported lost at sea the year before, and promises to ask Elliott to try to locate Paul.\n\nItinerant [[Quackery|quack]] Dr. Terminus and his assistant Hoagy win over the gullible townspeople, who are angered by their return (\u201cPassamaquoddy\u201d). Lampie and Hoagy attempt to prove that Elliott is real, but cannot get anyone to believe he exists. The next day, the local fishermen complain about the scarcity of fish, believing it is Pete's fault. Nora tells them the fishing grounds shift from time to time and Pete should be welcomed into town (\"There's Room for Everyone\"). That night, Nora and Lampie argue over Lampie's claims of seeing a dragon and Nora's beliefs of believing Paul will return, though Nora retains her faith in Paul (\"Candle on the Water\").\n\nLater, Nora takes Pete to start school, where the teacher, Miss Taylor, punishes him for Elliott's antics. An enraged Elliott smashes into the schoolhouse, leaving his shape in the wall and frightening the townspeople. The incident at the school convinces Terminus that the dragon is real and he and Hoagy conspire to exploit Elliott for medicinal profit (\"Every Little Piece\"). Pete accepts Nora and Lampie's invitation to live with them (\"Brazzle Dazzle Day\"). When the Gogans arrive in town and demand Pete be returned, Nora refuses to surrender him. As the Gogans chase them in a small boat, Elliott sinks it, saving Pete (\"Bill of Sale\"). Dr. Terminus teams up with the Gogans to capture Pete and Elliott, convincing the locals that capturing Elliott will solve their problems.\n\nThat evening, a storm blows in, while at sea, a ship approaches Passamaquoddy with Paul on board. Dr. Terminus lures Pete to the boathouse while Hoagy does the same to Elliott. Elliott is caught in a net, but frees himself. He retrieves Pete in a final confrontation with the Gogans, who flee after Elliott destroys their bill of sale. Dr. Terminus attempts to harpoon Elliott, but his leg is caught in the rope and he is sent catapulting through the ceiling, ending up dangling upside down near a utility pole. Elliott saves the Mayor, Miss Taylor, and the members of the Town Board from a falling utility pole, revealing himself to them. At the lighthouse, the lamp has been extinguished by a [[rogue wave]]. Elliott returns and lights it with his fire, revealing himself to Nora. The light is ignited and the ship is saved. \n\nThe next morning, the Mayor and the townsfolk praise Elliott for his help, and Nora is reunited with Paul. Paul explains he was the sole survivor of a shipwreck at [[Cape Hatteras]] and suffered amnesia, but something knocked him out of bed and restored his memory. Elliott tells Pete that he must move on to help another child in trouble. Elliott flies away as Pete and his new family wave goodbye, with Pete reminding Elliott that he is supposed to be invisible.\n\n== Cast (in order of opening credits)==\n* [[Helen Reddy]] as Nora, the kind daughter to the local lighthouse keeper.\n* [[Jim Dale]] as Dr. Terminus, a scheming [[Quackery|quack]] and showman.\n* [[Mickey Rooney]] as Lampie, Passamaquoddy's lighthouse keeper and Nora's father.\n* [[Red Buttons]] as Hoagy, the assistant to Dr. Terminus.\n* [[Shelley Winters]] as Lena Gogan, the [[matriarch]] of the Gogan family.\n* [[Sean Marshall (actor)|Sean Marshall]] as Pete, an orphan boy escaping the cruel Gogans.\n* [[Jane Kean]] as Miss Romy Taylor, Passamaquoddy's strict, no-nonsense, and abusive schoolteacher.\n* [[Jim Backus]] as Mayor of Passamaquoddy.\n* [[Charles Tyner]] as Merle Gogan, the [[patriarch]] of the Gogan family.\n* [[Gary Morgan (actor)|Gary Morgan]] as Grover Gogan, Merle and Lena's older sadistic son.\n* [[Jeff Conaway]] as Willie Gogan, Merle and Lena's younger sadistic son.\n* Cal Bartlett as Paul, a sailor who disappeared at sea, Nora's fianc\u00e9.\n* [[Charlie Callas]] as the vocal effects for Elliott, a dragon who befriends Pete.\n* [[Walt Barnes|Walter Barnes]] as Captain of the ship on which Paul returns home.\n\n== Music ==\nThe film's songs were written by [[Al Kasha]] and [[Joel Hirschhorn]].

By the following spring, veteran screenwriter [[Noel Langley]] had completed his draft of the script. However, Disney was still unsure of how to approach the project, and the project was placed in [[Turnaround (filmmaking)|turnaround]].<ref name=\"JimHill\" />\n\nIn 1968, writers Bill Raynor and [[Myles Wilder]] were hired to write the script, and completed their outline in October. They submitted their outline to the studio for review, but the project continued to languish in development.<ref name=\"ForPete'sSake\" /> In 1975, producer [[Jerome Courtland]] re-discovered the project and hired writer [[Malcolm Marmorstein]] to write the script.<ref name=\"ForPete'sSake\" /> For his script, Marmorstein revised the story from being in contemporary time into a period setting, and had the dragon changed from being wholly imaginary into a real one. In earlier drafts, Elliott was mostly invisible aside from one animated sequence, in which Dr. Terminus would chop up the dragon for his get-rich scheme. However, veteran Disney artist [[Ken Anderson (animator)|Ken Anderson]] felt the audience would \"lose patience\" with the idea and lobbied for Elliott to be seen more in his visible form during the film.<ref>{{cite news|last=Hammond|first=David|url=https://www.questia.com/magazine/1P3-1310593181/giving-a-personality-to-an-animated-dragon|title=Giving A Personality to An Animated Dragon|magazine=[[American Cinematographer]]|url-access=|volume=58|issue=10|date=October 1977|pages=1032\u201333|via=}}{{dead link|date=July 2021}}</ref> In retrospect, Marmorstein conceded that \"We tried a completely invisible dragon, but it was no fun. It was lacking. It's a visual medium, and you're making a film for kids.\" He also named the dragon \"Elliott\" after actor [[Elliott Gould]] (who was a friend from his theater days), and named the town \"Passamaquoddy\" after the real [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] tribe in [[Maine]].{{sfn|Koenig|1997|pp=162\u20133}}\n\nIn October 1975, the songwriting duo of [[Al Kasha]] and [[Joel Hirschhorn]] were assigned to compose the musical score.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/42944597/|title=Yablans to produce independent film|newspaper=[[The Mercury (Pennsylvania)|The Mercury]]|date=October 18, 1957|via=Newspapers.com|format=Subscription required|access-date=August 27, 2018|archive-date=August 28, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180828035931/https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/42944597/|url-status=live}}</ref> The production was directed by British filmmaker [[Don Chaffey]], who had made two smaller films for Disney in the early 1960s between directing larger fantasy adventures (''[[Jason and the Argonauts (1963 film)|Jason and the Argonauts]]'', ''[[One Million Years B.C.]]'') for others.\n\n=== Locations ===\nThe [[List of lighthouses in California#Notable Faux Lighthouse|lighthouse]] for the film was built on Point Buchon Trail in Montana De Oro State Park located south of [[Los Osos, California]],<ref name=DVDFilmFacts>{{cite video | title =Pete's Dragon. Bonus Features: Film Facts | format =DVD | publisher =Disney Enterprises (distributed by Buena Vista Home Entertainment) }}</ref> substituting for Maine. It was equipped with such a large beacon that Disney had to get special permission from the Coast Guard to operate it, since doing so during filming would have confused passing ships. Pacific Gas and Electric opened the Point Buchon Trail and allows hikers access to where filming took place ({{coord|35|14|49.08|N|120|53|50.63|W}}).\n\n=== Animation ===\nThe film's animators opted to make Elliott look more like an oriental, rather than occidental, dragon because [[Dragon#East Asia|oriental dragons]] are usually associated with good. The film is the first involving animation in which none of the [[Nine Old Men]]\u2014Disney's original team of animators\u2014were involved. One technique used in the movie involved compositing with a [[Sodium vapor process|yellowscreen]] that was originally used in ''[[Mary Poppins (film)|Mary Poppins]]'' and similar to today's [[Chroma key|greenscreen]] compositing, whereby up to three scenes might be overlaid together \u2013 for example, a live foreground, a live background, and an animated middle ground containing Elliott. Ken Anderson, who created Elliott, explained that he thought it would be appropriate to make him \"a little paunchy\" and not always particularly graceful at flying.<ref>{{cite AV media notes | people = Ken Anderson | title =Pete's Dragon.
