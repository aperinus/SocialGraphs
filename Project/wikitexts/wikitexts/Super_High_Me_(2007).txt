The DVD was released on April 20, 2008.\n\nBenson underwent various tests to gauge his physical and mental health, first during a 30-day period in which he abstained from cannabis use, then during another 30-day period in which he smoked and ingested cannabis every day. Benson's physician concluded that the effects on Benson's health from his use of cannabis were generally inconsequential. The greatest undesirable changes noted were a weight gain of eight pounds during his \"high\" month and a significant decrease in his ability to do mental mathematics. His [[sperm count]] increased, contrary to what might be expected based on medical studies. His overall score on the [[SAT]] increased, mainly due to an increased verbal score.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Summary of test results\n|-\n!\n! Sober Period\n!

Producer Alex Campbell wanted to make a film about the burgeoning medical marijuana scene in Los Angeles and ran into Blieden who casually mentioned the Doug Benson project and Campbell seized on it. Six months later the film was in production. Michael Blieden said about the making of the film, \"Without Alex the movie would have languished indefinitely.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://sites.google.com/site/superhighmenyc/ |title=superhighmenyc |date=2008-04-20 |accessdate=2016-12-16}}</ref> Campbell commented on the film's inception, \"I heard the joke and immediately knew it could be a film if Doug was willing to go through with the experiment.\"  <ref>{{cite news| url=https://articles.latimes.com/2008/apr/20/entertainment/ca-benson20 | work=Los Angeles Times | first=Michael | last=Shaw | title=A task that gives him such a high | date=April 20, 2008}}</ref>  When they made the film, Benson ensured that his \"antics\" were legally tolerated in the state of [[California]].  The comedian said of the experience, \"It would be difficult for anyone who has obligations to do, so I wouldn't break the law. I didn't operate a motor vehicle for the 30 days of filming. The crew drove me everywhere.\"  The documentary also featured notable cannabis advocates, including [[Marc Emery]], the Canadian \"Prince of Pot\"; and [[Dennis Peron]], founder of the [[Cannabis Buyers Club]] and coauthor of [[California Proposition 215]].  The film was reportedly marketed for the same budget as the cost of a two-inch advertisement in ''[[The New York Times]]''.<ref name=Times/>\n\n==Reception==\n''Super High Me'' had a regional premiere at the [[South by Southwest]] film festival in March 2008, where it screened alongside two other marijuana-focused films, ''[[Harold & Kumar Escape from Guantanamo Bay]]'' and ''[[Humboldt County (film)|Humboldt County]]''.<ref name=Fest/>  The documentary premiered to the public in the widest documentary opening ever, screening at over 1,000 venues on April&nbsp;20, 2008.  The release date was 4/20 in American vernacular, intended to reflect the number [[420 (cannabis culture)|420 in cannabis culture]].<ref name=Times/>  The film was distributed by Red Envelope Entertainment (a distribution arm of [[Netflix]]), B-side, and Screen Media Films in a partnership.  The companies arranged for [[grassroots]] screening events, where people could sign up on a website to receive a free DVD and have a public screening with a group of any size.  The aim of the distribution strategy was to encourage later DVD sales.<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Jones|first=Michael|url=https://www.variety.com/blog/1390000339/post/20023202.html?nid=3611|title=SXSW: Companies pact to distribute 'Super High Me'|magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=March 11, 2008|accessdate=September 2, 2009}}</ref>\n\nFrank Scheck of ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' thought that the documentary consisted of Benson merely \"expanding a bit from his stand-up act to strained results\".
