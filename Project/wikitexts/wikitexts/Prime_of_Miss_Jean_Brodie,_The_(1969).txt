The film stars [[Maggie Smith]] in the [[Jean Brodie|title role]] as an unrestrained teacher at a girls' school in [[Edinburgh]]. [[Celia Johnson]], [[Robert Stephens]], [[Pamela Franklin]], and [[Gordon Jackson (actor)|Gordon Jackson]] are featured in supporting roles.\n\n''The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie'' premiered at the [[1969 Cannes Film Festival]], where it competed for the [[Palme d'Or]] and was released in cinemas in the UK on 24 February 1969 and in the US on 2 March 1969. The film received positive reviews with major acclaim drawn towards Smith's performance, although it was a box office disappointment, grossing $3 million on a $2.76 million budget. It received two nominations at the [[42nd Academy Awards]]; [[Academy Award for Best Original Song|Best Original Song]] for its theme song \"[[Jean (song)|Jean]]\", and [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]] for Smith, winning for the latter.\n\n==Plot==\nJean Brodie is a teacher at an [[Single-sex education|all-girls school]] in [[Edinburgh]], Scotland, in the 1930s. Brodie is known for her tendency to stray from the school's curriculum, to romanticize fascist leaders like [[Benito Mussolini]] and [[Francisco Franco]], and to believe herself to be in the prime of life. Brodie devotes her energy and attention to girls she sees as special or moldable, who are referred to as the \"Brodie Set\". At the film's outset, the Brodie Set is composed of four 12-year-old junior school girls: Sandy, Monica, Jenny, and Mary.\n\nThe Brodie Set often go to art museums, theatre, and have picnics on the school lawn, to the chagrin of the school's austere headmistress Emmeline Mackay, who dislikes that the girls are cultured to the exclusion of hard knowledge, and seem precocious for their age. She has a grudge against Brodie, who has [[tenure]] and was hired six years before Mackay became headmistress. Brodie boasts to her girls that the only way she will stop teaching is if she is assassinated.\n\nBrodie catches the eye of the school's music teacher and choirmaster Gordon Lowther, with whom she and the girls spend weekends with at his luxurious home in [[Cramond]]. Brodie sometimes spends the night with Lowther, although she tries to conceal this from the girls. Lowther wishes to marry Brodie, but she still has feelings for the school's art teacher Teddy Lloyd, an ex-lover of Brodie's who steadily pursues her.\n\nAs the Brodie Set grow older and progress to the Senior School, they frequent Teddy Lloyd's studio, where he paints Jenny's portrait. Sandy initially rebuffs a lecherous advance from Lloyd. However, when Brodie tries to manoeuvre Jenny and Lloyd into an affair, and Sandy into spying on them, it is Sandy, resentful of Brodie's constant praise of Jenny's beauty, who becomes Teddy's lover and muse. Sandy ends the affair because of Lloyd's continuing obsession with Brodie.\n\nMary, influenced by Brodie, leaves the school to join her brother, whom she believes to be [[Spanish Civil War|fighting for Franco]]. She is killed shortly after crossing the frontier, which incites Sandy to inform the headmistress of Brodie's efforts to impose her politics on her students. The disclosure finally leads to Brodie's termination, her humiliation compounded by Mr. Lowther's engagement to another teacher.\n\nBefore Brodie's departure, Sandy confronts her about her manipulation of Mary, Mary's senseless death, and the harmful influence she exerted on other girls, adding that Mary's brother is actually fighting for the [[Republican faction (Spanish Civil War)|Spanish Republicans]]. Brodie responds with a series of harsh but astute comments about Sandy's character, particularly her ability to coldly judge and destroy others. Sandy retorts that Brodie professed to be an admirer of conquerors and walks out of the classroom, as Brodie screams, ''\"Assassin!\"''\n\nSandy, Monica, and Jenny graduate and leave the school. As Sandy departs, her face streaked with tears, Brodie's voice is heard proclaiming her oft-repeated motto: \"Little girls, I am in the business of putting old heads on young shoulders, and all my pupils are the ''[[wikt:cr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me|cr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me]]''. Give me a girl at an impressionable age, and she is mine for life.\"\n\n==Cast==\n<!--- Cast and order per tombstone opening credits, roles per closing credits scroll --->\n* [[Maggie Smith]] as [[Jean Brodie]] \n* [[Robert Stephens]] as Teddy Lloyd\n* [[Pamela Franklin]] as Sandy\n* [[Gordon Jackson (actor)|Gordon Jackson]] as Gordon Lowther\n* [[Jane Carr]] as Mary McGregor\n* [[Shirley Steedman]] as Monica\n* [[Diane Grayson]] as Jenny\n* [[Celia Johnson]] as Miss Mackay\n* Margo Cunningham as Miss Campbell\n* [[Isla Cameron]] as Miss McKenzie\n* [[Molly Weir]] as Miss Allison Kerr\n* [[Helena Gloag]] as Miss Ellen Kerr\n* [[Rona Anderson]] as Miss Lockhart\n* [[Ann Way]] as Miss Gaunt\n\nThe cast included two pairs of married actors: Maggie Smith and Robert Stephens, and Gordon Jackson and Rona Anderson. [[Julie Andrews]] was initially offered the role of Jean Brodie.<ref>{{cite web| url = https://www.theatermania.com/new-york-city-theater/news/all-about-julie_10273.html| title = All About Julie {{!}} TheaterMania}}</ref>\n\n==Relationship to novel and play==\nThere is a complex relationship between the novel, the play and the film.\n\nAllen created a successful play out of a challenging short novel. [[Vanessa Redgrave]] triumphed in the lead role in London, as did [[Zoe Caldwell]] in New York. [[Vincent Canby]], reviewing the film in the [[New York Times]], said, \"Jay Presson Allen . . . created a much better play than is generally recognized. Roles like that of Miss Jean Brodie don't often write themselves\" (3 March 1969). However, some critics have questioned whether the play is a particularly faithful adaptation. They have suggested that it turned an experimental work into a realistic one and removed some theological issues, turning the final product into a story of failed love<ref>\n{{cite book\n|title=Muriel Spark: The Biography\n|last=Stannard\n|first=Martin\n|publisher=[[W. W. Norton & Company]]\n|year=2010\n|isbn=978-0393051742\n|url-access=registration\n|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780393051742\n}}</ref> (and possibly also failed fascist politics).\n\nThe play reduced the number of girls in the Brodie Set from six to four (and discarded another girl not in the set) and some of them are [[composite character|composites]] of girls in the novel. Mary is a composite of the original Mary and Joyce Emily; although mainly based on the original Mary, in the novel it was Joyce Emily who died in the Spanish Civil War (Mary later dies in a fire instead), and rather more is made of this incident in the play than in the novel. Jenny is a composite of the original Jenny and Rose; in spite of her name she has more in common with Rose who, in the novel, Miss Brodie tried to manoeuvre into having an affair with Mr Lloyd.\n\nThe novel made extensive use of [[Flashforward|flash forward]]. The play largely dropped this device, although it did include a few scenes showing Sandy as a [[nun]] in later life. The film, which made a few changes from the play, discarded these scenes in favour of an entirely linear narrative.\n\n==Reception==\n===Box office===\nAccording to Fox records the film required $5,400,000 in rentals to break even and by 11 December 1970 had made $6,650,000.<ref>{{cite book|page=[https://archive.org/details/foxthatgotawayt00silv/page/328 328]|title=The Fox that got away : the last days of the Zanuck dynasty at Twentieth Century-Fox|url=https://archive.org/details/foxthatgotawayt00silv|url-access=registration|last=Silverman|first=Stephen M|year=1988|publisher=L.

[[Review aggregator|Review aggregate]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reports that 84% of 19 critics have given the film a positive review, with a rating average of 7.15 out of 10.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/prime_of_miss_jean_brodie/ |publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |title=The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie (1969) |access-date=8 October 2012}}</ref>\n\nMaggie Smith was singled out for her performance in the film. [[Dave Kehr]] of ''[[Chicago Reader]]'' said that Smith gives \"one of those technically stunning, emotionally distant performances that the British are so damn good at.\"<ref>{{cite news |last=Kehr |first=David |title=The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie |url=http://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/the-prime-of-miss-jean-brodie/Film?oid=1064172 |newspaper=[[Chicago Reader]] |access-date=8 October 2012}}</ref> Greg Ferrara wrote that the film \"is one of the best British films of the decade. It is as captivating today as it was upon its release and its two central performances by Maggie Smith and Pamela Franklin are both stirring and mesmerizing.

Rather than recapitulate the plot of the novel, the series imagined episodes in the lives of the characters, such as conflict between Jean Brodie and the father of an Italian refugee student, who fled Mussolini's Italy because the father was persecuted as a journalist who objected to fascism.  It consisted of seven episodes of 50 minutes. It was released on DVD in Region 1 and 2.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|0064840|The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie}}\n* {{tcmdb title|87120|The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie}}\n* {{amg movie|39171}}\n* {{AFI film|id=23862|title=The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie}}\n\n{{Ronald Neame}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Prime Of Miss Jean Brodie, The}}\n[[Category:1969 films]]\n[[Category:1969 drama films]]\n[[Category:1960s coming-of-age drama films]]\n[[Category:1960s English-language films]]\n[[Category:20th Century Fox films]]\n[[Category:Films set in schools]]\n[[Category:British coming-of-age drama films]]\n[[Category:British films based on plays]]\n[[Category:Films about educators]]\n[[Category:Films about fascism]]\n[[Category:Films based on adaptations]]\n[[Category:Films based on British novels]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Ronald Neame]]\n[[Category:Films featuring a Best Actress Academy Award-winning performance]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Rod McKuen]]\n[[Category:Films set in Edinburgh]]\n[[Category:Films set in the 1930s]]\n[[Category:Films shot at Pinewood Studios]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Edinburgh]]\n[[Category:1960s British films]]"}]}}}}
