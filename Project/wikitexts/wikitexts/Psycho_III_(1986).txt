It stars [[Anthony Perkins]], who also directs the film, reprising the role of [[Norman Bates]]. It co-stars [[Diana Scarwid]], [[Jeff Fahey]], and [[Roberta Maxwell]]. The screenplay is written by [[Charles Edward Pogue]]. The original electronic music score is composed and performed by [[Carter Burwell]] in one of his earliest projects. ''Psycho III'' is unrelated to [[Robert Bloch]]'s third ''Psycho'' novel, ''[[Psycho House]]'', which was released in 1990.\n\nThe film takes place one month after the events of ''[[Psycho II (film)|Psycho II]]'' where Norman Bates is still running the Bates Motel with the corpse of Emma Spool still sitting up in the house. A suicidal nun, with whom Norman falls in love, comes to the motel along with a drifter named Duane Duke. A reporter also tries to solve the mysterious disappearance of Mrs. Spool as someone begins another murder spree.\n\nReleased on July 2, 1986, ''Psycho III'' grossed $14.4 million at the U.S. box office on a budget of $8.4 million, becoming the lowest-grossing film in the series. It received mixed reviews from critics and was followed by a television prequel, ''[[Psycho IV: The Beginning]]''.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1982, [[Norman Bates]] works at the Bates Motel and lives with the preserved corpse of [[Emma Spool]], a waitress who told him she was his real mother. When Spool remains missing after a month, Norman's ex-boss, Ralph Statler, and local law enforcement grow concerned. Duane Duke, a sleazy musician desperate for money, is offered the job of assistant manager at the motel. Tracy Venable, a journalist from [[Los Angeles]], is working on an article about serial killers being released from custody. Believing that Norman is killing again, Tracy appears at the diner where he works and attempts to talk with him. Norman opens up to her but is distracted when Maureen Coyle, a young, mentally unstable former nun, enters. Maureen resembles his former victim, [[Marion Crane]]. Seeing the initials \"M.C.\" on her suitcase, Norman panics and leaves the diner.\n\n\"Mother\" enters Maureen's bathroom that night, intending to kill her, only to find that she has cut her wrists. The shock of this causes Norman to reassert his personality while a delirious Maureen mistakes \"Mother\" holding a knife for the [[Virgin Mary]] holding a crucifix. Norman brings Maureen to a hospital and offers that she stay as long as she needs to. After she is released, they begin a romantic relationship. That night, Duke picks up a girl named Red at a bar, but after Red makes it clear that she wants more than a fling, Duke rejects her. Red tries calling a cab, but \"Mother\" shatters the phone booth door and stabs Red to death. The following day, tourists arrive at the motel, planning to watch a [[American football|football]] game. Tracy searches Spool's apartment, discovering the motel's phone number written on a magazine cover repeatedly.\n\nPatsy Boyle, the motel's only sober guest, is murdered by \"Mother\". Norman finds her body and buries her in the motel's ice chest. The next morning, Sheriff Hunt and Deputy Leo appear to investigate Patsy's disappearance. Tracy tells Maureen about Norman's past, causing Maureen to stay with Father Brian, who took care of her at the hospital. Norman finds that Spool's corpse is missing and finds a note stating that she is in Cabin 12. Duke extorts Norman, threatening to turn him into the police for murder unless he is given a large sum of money. In an ensuing fight, Norman beats Duke with his guitar until he loses consciousness. Norman drives his car to the swamp with Duke and Patsy's bodies inside. Duke regains consciousness and attacks Norman, who accidentally drives into the swamp. Norman escapes the car while Duke drowns.\n\nTracy talks to Statler about Spool and discovers she was working at the diner before Statler purchased it from Harvey Leach. Tracy meets with Leach, a resident at an assisted living facility, and is informed that Spool was also institutionalized for murder. Maureen convinces herself that Norman is her true love and returns to the motel. They share a tender moment at the top of the staircase when \"Mother\" shouts furiously at Norman, startling him. He loses his grip on Maureen's hands, causing her to fall down the stairs, killing her. Enraged, Norman promises \"Mother\" that he will get her for this. Tracy enters the house and finds Maureen dead, then sees Norman dressed as \"Mother\" bearing a knife, but is unable to flee.\n\nTracy tries reasoning with Norman by explaining his family history: Emma Spool was his aunt and was in love with Norman's father, but he married her sister, [[Norma Bates (Psycho)|Norma]]. Spool killed Norman's father and kidnapped Norman when he was a child, believing he was the child \"she should have had with him\". When she was caught, Norman was returned to Norma while Spool was institutionalized. Tracy discovers Spool's corpse in the bedroom. Norman takes off his dress. \"Mother\" orders him to kill Tracy, but when Norman raises the knife, he attacks \"Mother\" instead, dismembering Spool's corpse. Sheriff Hunt takes Norman to his squad car. Hunt informs Norman that he'll never get out of the institution again, to which Norman replies: \"But I'll be free...I'll finally be free\". In the back of the squad car, Norman caresses the severed hand of Emma Spool.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Anthony Perkins]] as [[Norman Bates]]\n* [[Diana Scarwid]] as Maureen Coyle\n* [[Jeff Fahey]] as Duane Duke\n* [[Roberta Maxwell]] as Tracy Venable\n* [[Hugh Gillin]] as Sheriff John Hunt\n* [[Robert Alan Browne]] as Ralph Statler\n* Gary Bayer as Father Brian\n* [[Lee Garlington]] as Myrna\n* [[Donovan Scott]] as Kyle\n* [[Karen Hensel]] as Sister Catherine\n* [[Jack Murdock (actor)|Jack Murdock]] as Lou\n* [[Katt Shea]] as Patsy Boyle\n* Juliette Cummins as Red\n* Steve Guevara as Deputy Leo\n* Hugo Stanger as Harvey Leach\n* [[Janet Leigh]] as [[Marion Crane]] (flashback)\n* [[Claudia Bryar]] as [[Emma Spool]] (flashback) \n}}\n\n==Music==\n{{Infobox album\n| name       = Psycho III:<br />Music from the Motion Picture\n| type       = [[Soundtrack]]\n| artist     = [[Carter Burwell]]\n| cover      =\n| alt        =\n| released   = July 1986\n| recorded   =\n| venue      =\n| studio     =\n| genre      = [[Soundtrack]]\n| length     = 30:39\n| label      = [[MCA Records]]\n| producer   = [[Carter Burwell]]\n| prev_title =\n| prev_year  =\n| next_title =\n| next_year  =\n| misc       = {{Singles\n | name        = Psycho III\n | type        = soundtrack\n | single1     = Scream of Love\n | single1date = July 1986\n}}\n}}\n\n{{Track listing\n| headline        = Side one\n| all_writing     = Carter Burwell, except where noted<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/Carter-Burwell-Psycho-III-Music-From-The-Motion-Picture/release/3752611|title=Carter Burwell - Psycho III (Music From The Motion Picture)|website=Discogs}}</ref>\n| title1          = Scream of Love (Theme Song From the Motion Picture ''Psycho III'')\n| writer1         = Carter Burwell/David Sanborn/Steve Bray\n| length1         = 3:47\n| title2          = Maureen in the Desert\n| length2         = 1:56\n| title3          = Dirty Street\n| writer3         = Carter Burwell/Stanton-Miranda/Steve Bray\n| length3         = 3:37\n| title4          = Before and After Shower\n| length4         = 3:36\n| title5          = Warm as a Cry for Help\n| length5         = 2:20\n}}\n\n{{Track listing\n| headline        = Side two\n| title6          = Sisters/Catherine Mary\n| writer6         = Carter Burwell/Stanton-Miranda/Steve Bray\n| length6         = 4:13\n| title7          = Mother?\n| length7         = 2:45\n| title8          = Bad Boys and Body Bags\n| length8         = 3:53\n| title9          = Revenge of a Thankless Child\n| length9         = 2:47\n| title10         = Electroshock Waiting Room\n| length10        = 1:45\n}}\n\n[[Carter Burwell]] was approached by Perkins to compose the score to the film, since Perkins had enjoyed Burwell's work on ''[[Blood Simple]]''. Perkins stated that he wanted to take the score in a more contemporary direction than [[Jerry Goldsmith]] had for his more traditional score for ''[[Psycho II (film)|Psycho II]]''. Burwell flew to Los Angeles and recorded the score largely on a [[Synclavier]] electronic music station, augmented by women's and boys' choirs as well as percussion by Steve Forman.<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite web|url=http://www.carterburwell.com/projects/Psycho3.html|title=Carter Burwell - Psycho III|first=Carter|last=Burwell|website=www.carterburwell.com}}</ref>\n\nAfter Universal suggested the film contain some pop songs so that the film could be marketable to the MTV generation, Burwell composed and performed songs with colleagues [[Stanton Miranda]] and [[Steve Bray]]. After Universal claimed the songs weren't sufficiently bankable, Burwell attempted to create a song with [[Oingo Boingo]] frontman and then burgeoning film composer [[Danny Elfman]], using sampled strings from [[Bernard Herrmann]]'s score to the original ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]''. This idea was also rejected.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\nUniversal finally agreed to let Burwell take a motif from the score he'd composed and develop it into an instrumental electronic pop song. The song, \"Scream of Love\"\u2014co-written by jazz saxophonist [[David Sanborn]]\u2014was released as a 7\" single and a series of dance remixes were commissioned from [[Arthur Baker (musician)|Arthur Baker]] and featured on the 12\" version. MCA also commissioned a music video for the song featuring Burwell, Perkins and a \"Hitchcockian woman\". Perkins introduced the video on [[MTV]] as a guest [[VJ (media personality)|VJ]] on July 2, 1986.<ref name=\"auto\"/> The rest of the songs composed by Burwell, Miranda and Bray were used as background music in the film, playing from car stereos and jukeboxes.\n\nBurwell's score was sampled by the [[hip hop music|hip hop]] group [[Insane Poetry]] on \"Welcome to the Grim Side\", the intro to their 1992 debut album ''[[Grim Reality (album)|Grim Reality]]'', as well as on British musician [[Aim (musician)|Aim]]'s 1999 [[electronica]] album, [[Cold Water Music]].\n\n==Release==\nWhen the film opened on July 2, 1986, it earned $3.2 million in its opening weekend and went on to gross $14.4 million at the domestic box office, becoming the lowest-grossing theatrical film of the ''Psycho'' series.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=psycho3.htm|title=Psycho III|publisher=boxofficemojo.com|access-date=2011-04-17}}</ref>\n\n==Critical response==\nReviews from critics were mixed. [[Vincent Canby]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote a generally positive review, calling Perkins a \"very creditable director\" and Pogue's screenplay \"efficient\", concluding that \"''Psycho III'' expresses its appreciation of the Hitchcock legacy without seeming to rip it off\".<ref>{{cite journal |last=Canby |first=Vincent |author-link=Vincent Canby |date=July 2, 1986 |title=Film: Anthony Perkins in 'Psycho III' |journal=[[The New York Times]] |page=C15}}</ref> ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' wrote that the film \"has its moments\u2014about 20 minutes' worth\u2014but the rest is filler in which the filmmakers gamely but futilely try to breathe new life into a tired body\".<ref>{{cite journal |date=July 2, 1986 |title=Psycho III |journal=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |page=13}}</ref> Michael Wilmington of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' thought that the film was \"better in most respects than 'II'\", but \"it fails any sequel's acid test.

On their television show ''[[At the Movies (1982 TV program)|At the Movies]]'', Ebert gave the film a \"thumbs up\" positive appraisal, saying it was a \"much better movie than part two\", and adding, \"in his first directing effort, Perkins shows that he knows Norman better than anyone else\". Siskel, however, gave the film a \"thumbs down\" negative rating, reasoning that he was \"turned off by some of the violence\" and that the film \"just sort of laid there\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IpDhDrdve08 |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211221/IpDhDrdve08 |archive-date=2021-12-21 |url-status=live|title=''At the Movies'': ''Psycho III'' review|publisher=YouTube|access-date=2018-02-12}}{{cbignore}}</ref>\n\nAs of September 2022, the film holds a 59% approval rating based on 32 reviews on the review aggregator [[Rotten Tomatoes]], with an average rating of 5.5/10.
