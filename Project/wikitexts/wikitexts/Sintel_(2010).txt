It was the third [[Blender (software)|Blender]] [[Blender (software)#Open projects|\"open movie\"]]. It was produced by [[Ton Roosendaal]], chairman of the [[Blender Foundation]], written by Esther Wouda, directed by Colin Levy, at the time an artist at [[Pixar]] and art direction by [[David Revoy]], who is known for ''[[Pepper&Carrot]]'' an [[Open-source license|open source]] [[webcomic]] series.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Interview with Sintel's art director David Revoy {{!}} Libre Graphics World|url=http://libregraphicsworld.org/blog/entry/interview-with-sintel-art-director-david-revoy|access-date=2020-09-26|website=libregraphicsworld.org}}</ref> It was made at the Blender Institute, part of the Blender Foundation. The plot follows the character, Sintel, who is tracking down her pet Scales, a [[dragon]]. Just like the other Blender \"open movies,\" the film was made using [[Blender (software)|Blender]], a [[free and open source software]] application for animation, created and supported by the Blender Foundation.\n\nThe name comes from the [[Dutch language|Dutch]] word ''[[wikt:sintel|sintel]]'', which can mean '[[Ember|cinder]]',<ref>{{cite web| title = Definition of Cinder| publisher = Dictionary.net| url = http://www.dictionary.net/cinder}}</ref> or '[[ember]]'.<ref>{{cite web| title = Logo/identity design| url = https://durian.blender.org/news/logo-identity-design/| publisher = Durian.blender.org}}</ref>\n\n==Overview==\nWork began in May 2009. The film was officially released on 27 September 2010 at the Netherlands Film Festival.<ref name=\"Sintel_official_premiere\"/> The online release was made available for download on 30 September 2010.<ref name=\"onlineRelease\">{{cite web|url = https://durian.blender.org| title = Sintel&nbsp;\u2014 Official website| access-date = 3 July 2014\n}}</ref> The film was viewed over 1,000,000 times in a matter of weeks. By May 2020, it was viewed 5.2 million times on [[YouTube]].<ref name=\"onlineRelease\"/>\n\n==Plot==\nThe main character, Sintel, is attacked while traveling through a wintry [[mountain]]side. After defeating her attacker and taking his spear, she finds refuge in a [[shaman]]'s hut. He asks her why she is traveling, and she confesses that she is looking for a [[dragon]], leading into a flashback. Sintel was a homeless [[loner]], looking for food when she discovered an injured baby dragon. She nursed him back to health and named him Scales, and the two quickly formed an emotional bond. One day, while Scales was flying, he was captured by an adult dragon. Determined to get him back, she began the long and dangerous journey that led her to the shaman's hut.\n\nSintel is ready to give up when the shaman tells her that they are in dragon lands, showing her the glyph on her attacker's spear as proof. She finds the tree pictured on the spear, and near it a [[cave]] with an adult dragon and his baby. The baby runs away upon seeing Sintel, and the adult dragon attacks. After a brief battle the adult dragon pins Sintel to the ground, but freezes when he recognizes her scent. Sintel takes advantage of this momentary pause and stabs the dragon in the heart. As she is about to land the killing blow, she notices the scar on his wing is exactly the same as her old friend's. Sintel discovers in a moment of horror that she has just killed Scales.\n\nScales bleeds out rapidly, and Sintel stares in shock at her reflection in a pool of blood. It is revealed that she is significantly older than she has appeared throughout the film. She has much gray hair, worn and wrinkled skin, and several scars on her body. The long search for Scales had lasted many years, and she had never realized that Scales would have grown up. Her single-minded quest to get back her friend, and to take revenge on the large dragon who took Scales away, contributed to her mistaking Scales for the small dragon. The cave begins to collapse as Scales gives his last breath, and Sintel runs for the entrance.\n\nAfter mourning over the friend she killed, Sintel leaves, heartbroken. Scales' baby, having nowhere else to go, follows her.\n\n==Announcements==\nSome sections were displayed on 25 October 2009,<ref>{{cite web|last=Durian|first=Project|url=https://vimeo.com/7278543|title=Durian First Minute \u2014 01 |publisher=Vimeo.com|access-date=22 February 2012}}</ref> {{YouTube|HOfdboHvshg|the trailer}} was made available on 13 May 2010,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOfdboHvshg |title=\"Sintel\" Trailer, Durian Open Movie Project |publisher=YouTube |access-date=25 July 2010}}</ref> while an almost-final version of the movie screened at a \"pre-premiere\" on 19 July 2010.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://durian.blender.org/news/sintel-pre-premiere/|title=Sintel Pre-premiere|publisher=Durian.blender.org|date=19 July 2010|access-date=22 February 2012}}</ref> The full movie premiered at the [[Netherlands Film Festival]] on 27 September 2010,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://durian.blender.org/news/sintel-official-premiere/|title=Sintel Official Premiere|publisher=Durian.blender.org|date=16 August 2010 |access-date=22 February 2012}}</ref> and was officially released online on 30 September.<ref name=\"onlineRelease\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blendernation.com/2010/09/23/sintel-release-expected-thursday-september-30th/|title=Sintel Release Expected Thursday, September 30th}}</ref>\n\n==Technical information==\nFollowing ''[[Elephants Dream]]'', ''[[Big Buck Bunny]]'', and ''[[Yo Frankie]]'', the short movie is the fourth project created by the Blender Foundation. ''Sintel'' was created by the Blender Institute, a division of the Blender Foundation set up specifically to facilitate the creation of [[open content]] films and games.<ref name=about>{{cite web|url=https://peach.blender.org/index.php/about|title=About|work=Big Buck Bunny site|publisher=Blender Foundation|access-date=4 February 2008}}</ref><ref name=institute>{{cite web|url=https://www.blender.org/blender-institute|title=Blender Institute|publisher=[[Blender Foundation]]|access-date=4 February 2008|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080510143352/http://www.blender.org/blender-institute/|archive-date=10 May 2008}}</ref>\n\nThe film was funded by the Blender Foundation, donations from the Blender community, pre-sales of the film's [[DVD]] and commercial sponsorship.

Improvements were made in the user interface, the [[particle system]], sculpting, [[Shading#Computer graphics|shading]], the [[Rendering (computer graphics)|render pipeline]], constraints, and smoke simulation. These features were released to the public with Blender v. 2.50 alpha through 2.54 beta.<ref>{{cite web|title = Blender 2.56a Beta | publisher = Blender Foundation|url = https://www.blender.org/development/release-logs/blender-254-beta/}}</ref>\n\n==Copyright incident==\nOn 5 April 2014, ''Sintel'' was temporarily blocked from viewing on the Blender Foundation's official YouTube channel after [[Sony Pictures Entertainment|Sony Pictures]] issued a takedown notice to YouTube falsely claiming it owned the [[copyright]]s to the film.<ref>{{cite web|last=Phipps|first=Simon|author-link=Simon Phipps (programmer)|title=Sony and Google gang up for an illegal video takedown|url=http://www.infoworld.com/d/open-source-software/sony-and-google-gang-illegal-video-takedown-240357|publisher=[[InfoWorld]]|access-date=1 July 2014|date=14 April 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Reviews==\nDutch daily newspaper ''[[Het Parool]]'' featured a capture of the film on its front page, along with a short review describing it as \"darker and less accessible than its child friendly predecessors,\" but also stating that in \"image quality, detail and characters, the film is on par with Hollywood animation.\"<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.parool.nl/parool/nl/21/FILM/article/detail/1022634/2010/09/30/Animatie-Sintel-zet-de-standaard.dhtml|title = Animatie 'Sintel' zet de standaard (Animation 'Sintel' sets the standard)|date = 9 September 2010<!--, 11:07-->|publisher = Het Parool}}</ref>\n\n==Game==\n{{Main|Sintel The Game}}\n\nA game based on Sintel was officially announced on blenderartists.org on 12 May 2010.
