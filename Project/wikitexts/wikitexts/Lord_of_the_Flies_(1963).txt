It was written and directed by [[Peter Brook]] and produced by [[Lewis M. Allen]]. The film was in production for much of 1961, though the film did not premiere until 1963, and was not released in the United Kingdom until 1964. Golding himself supported the film. When [[Kenneth Tynan]] was a script editor for [[Ealing Studios]] he commissioned a script of ''Lord of the Flies'' from [[Nigel Kneale]], but Ealing Studios closed in 1959 before it could be produced.\n\nThe novel was [[Lord of the Flies (1990 film)|adapted]] into a movie for a second time in 1990; the 1963 film is generally considered more faithful to the novel than the 1990 adaptation.\n\n==Plot==\nIn the prologue, told through photographs, a group of schoolboys is evacuated from [[England]] following the outbreak of an unidentified war. Their aircraft is shot down by a briefly-glimpsed fighter plane and ditches near a remote island.\n\nThe main character, Ralph, is seen walking through a tropical forest. He meets a chubby, bespectacled, intelligent boy who reveals his school nickname was Piggy, but asks that Ralph not repeat that. The two go to the beach where they find a [[conch|conch shell]], which Ralph blows to rally the other survivors. As they emerge from the jungle, it becomes clear that no adults have escaped the crash. Singing is then heard and a small column of school choir boys, wearing dark cloaks and hats and led by a boy named Jack Merridew, walk towards Ralph and Piggy.\n\nThe boys decide to appoint a chief. The vote goes to Ralph, not Jack. Initially, Ralph is able to steer the boys (all of whom are aged between about six and fourteen) towards a reasonably civilised and co-operative society. The choir boys make wooden spears, creating the appearance that they are warriors within the group. Crucially, Jack has a knife. Ralph, Jack, and a choir boy named Simon go off to explore, and find out they are indeed on a deserted island. The boys have another assembly where Ralph tells the boys to make a fire.\n\nThe boys build shelters and start a signal fire using Piggy's spectacles. With no rescue in sight, the increasingly authoritarian and violence-prone Jack starts hunting and eventually finds a pig. Meanwhile, the fire, for which he and his \"hunters\" are responsible, goes out, losing the boys' chance of being spotted from a passing aeroplane. Piggy chastises Jack, and Jack strikes him in retaliation, knocking his glasses off, and breaking one lens. Ralph is furious with Jack. Soon some of the boys begin to talk of a beast that comes from the water. The next day, twins Sam and Eric see something land on the mountain, and they tell the boys it's another beast. All the boys except Piggy and the littluns go searching for it. Ralph, Jack, and another boy named Roger continue on to the top of the mountain and see something move. The boys all run away. The next day, Jack, obsessed with this imagined threat, leaves the group to start a new tribe, one without rules, where the boys play and hunt all day. Soon, more follow until only a few, including Piggy, are left with Ralph.\n\nEvents reach a crisis when Simon finds a sow's head impaled on a stick, left by Jack as an offering to the beast. He becomes hypnotized by the head, which has flies swarming all around it. Simon then climbs the mountain and sees that what the other boys thought was a beast is actually the dead body of a parachutist. Simon runs to Jack's camp in an attempt to tell them the truth, but the frenzied boys in the darkness mistake him for the beast, and beat him to death. Piggy defends the group's actions with a series of rationalisations and denials. The hunters raid the old group's camp and steal Piggy's glasses. Ralph goes to talk to the new group using the still-present power of the conch to get their attention. However, when Piggy takes the conch, they are not silent (as their rules require) but instead jeer. Roger pushes a boulder off a cliff which falls on Piggy, killing him and crushing the conch. Piggy's body falls into the ocean and gets washed away.\n\nRalph hides in the jungle. Jack and his hunters set fires to smoke him out, and Ralph staggers across the smoke-covered island. Stumbling onto the beach, Ralph falls at the feet of a [[Royal Navy]] officer and landing party, who stare in shock at the painted and spear-carrying savages that the boys have become. One of the youngest boys, Percival, tries to tell the officer his name, but cannot remember it. The last scene shows Ralph sobbing as flames spread across the island.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[James Aubrey (actor)|James Aubrey]] as Ralph\n* Tom Chapin as Jack\n* Hugh Edwards as Piggy\n* Roger Elwin as Roger\n* Tom Gaman as Simon\n* David Surtees as Sam\n* Simon Surtees as Eric\n* [[Nicholas Hammond]] as Robert\n* Roger Allan as Piers\n* Kent Fletcher as Percival\n* Richard Horne as Lance\n* Timothy Horne as Leslie\n* Andrew Horne as Matthew\n* Peter Davy as Peter\n* David Brunjes as Donald\n* Christopher Harris as Bill\n* Alan Heaps as Neville\n* Jonathan Heaps as Howard\n* Burnes Hollyman as Douglas\n* Peter Ksiezopolski as Francis\n* Anthony Mcall-Judson as Maurice\n* Malcolm Rodker as Harold \n* David St. Clair as George \n* Rene Sanfiorenzo Jr. as Charles\n* Jeremy Scuse as Rowland\n* John Stableford as Digby\n* Nicholas Valkenburg as Rupert\n* Patrick Valkenburg as Robin\n* Edward Valencia as Frederick\n* David Walsh as Percy\n* John Walsh as Michael \n* Jeremy Willis as Henry\n* Erik Jordan as Head Clapper Boy\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Theme==\nAs with Golding's book, the pessimistic theme of the film is that fear, hate and violence are inherent in the human condition \u2013 even when innocent children are placed in seemingly idyllic isolation. The realisation of this is seen as being the cause of Ralph's distress in the closing shots.<ref>Robert Wallace, Life Magazine 25 October 1963</ref>\n\nCharles Silver, curator in the Department of Film at [[MoMA]], wrote that the film is \"about anarchy and how that thin veneer we wear of what we refer to as 'civilization' is threatened by the attractive clarion call of bestiality and its accompanying hatred\".<ref name=\"Silver\">{{cite web |last1=Silver |first1=Charles |title=Peter Brook's Lord of the Flies |url=http://www.moma.org/explore/inside_out/2013/11/12/peter-brooks-lord-of-the-flies |date=12 November 2013 |website=[[Museum of Modern Art|MoMA]] |accessdate=6 June 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Production==\n\n===Filming===\nThe parents of the boys chosen as actors were reported to have been provided copies of the novel, from which a commentary had been physically removed; those pages included describing the culmination of the hunt of a wild sow as an \"[[Oedipus|Oedipal]] [[Consummation|wedding night]]\".<!-- Coverage contemporary to the release, probably in ''Time'' magazine. --> Brook noted that \"time was short; we were lent the children by unexpectedly eager parents just for the duration of the summer holidays\".<ref>{{cite book|last1=Brook|first1=Peter|title=Threads of time : a memoir|date=1998|publisher=Methuen Drama|location=London|isbn=0413733009|page=129|edition=Paperback.}}</ref>\n\nThe film was shot entirely in [[Puerto Rico]] at [[Aguadilla]], [[El Yunque, Puerto Rico|El Yunque]] and on the island of [[Vieques]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://viequesinsider.com/lord-flies-came-vieques/ |title=When Lord of the Flies Came to Vieques |author=Carrasquilo, Jos\u00e9 |date=2016 |website=Vieques Insider |accessdate=21 April 2019 }}</ref> The boys in the cast were all non-professional, had mostly not read the book, and actual scripting was minimal; scenes were filmed by explaining them to the boys, who then acted them out, with some of the dialogue improvised.<ref name=\"Silver\"/><ref name=\"Brooke\">{{cite web|last1=Michael|first1=Brooke|title=Lord of the Flies (1963)|url=http://www.screenonline.org.uk/film/id/555873/|website=www.screenonline.org.uk|accessdate=20 July 2015}}</ref> [[Life magazine|''Life'' magazine]] journalist Robert Wallace visited them there and observed one of them amusing himself by feeding live lizards into the blades of a rotating fan. Wallace commented: \"One could almost hear William Golding, 4,000 miles away in England, chuckling into his beard.\"<ref name=\"Brooke\"/>\n\nThe 60 hours of film from the 1961 shoot was edited down to 4 hours, according to editor Gerald Feil. This was further edited to a 100-minute feature that was shown at the 1963 Cannes Film Festival (9 to 22 May), but the cuts necessitated that new audio transitions and some dialog changes be dubbed into the film more than a year after shooting. The voice of James Aubrey, who played Ralph, had dropped three octaves and was electronically manipulated to better approximate his earlier voice, but it is still significantly different. Tom Chapin, who played Jack, had lost his English accent and another boy's voice was used to dub his parts. The U.S. distributor insisted the film be further edited to 90 minutes, so one fire scene and scenes developing the character of Ralph were cut.\n\nIn 1996, Peter Brook organised a reunion for the cast members for a documentary film titled ''Time Flies''. Brook was \"curious to know what the years had done to his cast, and what effect the isolated months of filming had had on their lives\".<ref name=\"Hollindale\">{{cite web|last1=Hollindale|first1=Peter|title=A History of Savages|url=https://www.tes.co.uk/article.aspx?storycode=371472|website=www.tes.co.uk|accessdate=20 July 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160312072112/https://www.tes.com/article.aspx?storycode=371472 |archivedate=12 March 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Although none seemed damaged by their time working on the film, Simon Surtees, one of a pair of twin brothers who played Sam and Eric, \"put his finger unerringly on the ethical dilemma. The problem is that most of us are not trained artists, so I now believe Peter runs the risk of abandoning us to our fate, just as he did in 1961, when he plucked us from our schools and our homes, put us on the island, then cast us back to live our lives as if nothing would ever change.\"<ref name=\"Hollindale\"/>\n\nTom Gaman, who played Simon in Brook's film, remembered that \"although I didn't think much about it at the time, in hindsight my death scene scares me. It was night, the spears \u2013 those wooden stakes \u2013 were quite real. We were excited, brandishing flaming sticks around a bonfire on the beach in a real storm.
