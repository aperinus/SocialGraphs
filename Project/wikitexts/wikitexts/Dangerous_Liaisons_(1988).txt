To soothe her wounded pride and embarrass Bastide, she seeks to arrange the seduction and disgrace of his young virgin fianc\u00e9e, C\u00e9cile de Volanges ([[Uma Thurman]]), who has only recently been [[debutante|presented to society]] after spending her formative years in the shelter of a [[convent]].\n\nMerteuil calls on the similarly unprincipled Vicomte de Valmont ([[John Malkovich]]), another ex-lover of hers, to do the deed. Valmont declines, as he is plotting to seduce Madame de Tourvel ([[Michelle Pfeiffer]]), the wife of a member of Parliament away in [[Burgundy]] and a current houseguest of Valmont's aunt, Madame de Rosemonde ([[Mildred Natwick]]). Amused and incredulous at Valmont's hubris in pursuing the chaste, devoutly religious Tourvel, Merteuil ups the ante: if Valmont somehow succeeds in seducing Tourvel and can furnish written proof, Merteuil will sleep with him as well. Never one to refuse a challenge, Valmont accepts.\n\nTourvel rebuffs all of Valmont's advances. Searching for leverage, he instructs his page Azolan to seduce Tourvel's maid Julie and gain access to Tourvel's private correspondence. One of the letters intercepted is from C\u00e9cile's mother and Merteuil's cousin, Madame de Volanges, warning Tourvel that Valmont is a nefarious and untrustworthy individual. Valmont resolves to seduce C\u00e9cile as revenge for her mother's accurate denunciation of him.\n\nMeanwhile, in Paris, C\u00e9cile meets the charming and handsome Chevalier Raphael Danceny ([[Keanu Reeves]]), who becomes her music teacher. They fall in love with coaxing from Merteuil, who knows that Danceny, a poor commoner, can never qualify as a bona fide suitor.\n\nValmont gains access to C\u00e9cile's bedchamber on a pretense, sexually assaults her, and blackmails her into sex as she pleads with him to leave. On the pretext of illness, C\u00e9cile remains locked in her chambers, refusing all visitors. A concerned Madame de Volanges asks Merteuil to speak to C\u00e9cile; C\u00e9cile confides in Merteuil, naively assuming that she has C\u00e9cile's best interests at heart. Merteuil advises C\u00e9cile to welcome Valmont's advances; she says young women should take advantage of all the lovers they can acquire in a society so repressive and contemptuous of women. The result is a \"student-teacher\" relationship; by day, C\u00e9cile is courted by Danceny, and each night she receives a sexual \"lesson\" from Valmont. In the meantime, Merteuil begins an affair with Danceny.\n\nMeanwhile, Valmont manages to win Tourvel's heart, but at a cost: the lifelong bachelor playboy falls in love. In a fit of jealousy, Merteuil mocks Valmont and threatens to trash his reputation as a carefree gigolo. She also refuses to honor her end of their agreement since Valmont has no written proof that the relationship has been consummated. Valmont abruptly dismisses Tourvel with a terse excuse: \"It is beyond my control.\" Meanwhile, after a night in Valmont's bed, C\u00e9cile miscarries his child.\n\nOverwhelmed with grief and shame, Tourvel retreats to a monastery where her health deteriorates rapidly. Valmont warns Danceny of Merteuil's ulterior motives in seducing him; she retaliates by informing Danceny that Valmont has been sleeping with C\u00e9cile. Danceny challenges Valmont to a duel ending with Valmont voluntarily running into Danceny's sword. With his dying breath, Valmont asks Danceny to communicate to Tourvel\u2014by now near death\u2014his true feelings for her. He also gives Danceny his collection of intimate letters from Merteuil, and Danceny publishes them, while C\u00e9cile informs her mother of her intention to return permanently to the convent. All of Paris learns the full range of Merteuil's schemes and depredations. Booed and humiliated at the op\u00e9ra by her former friends and sycophants, Merteuil flees in disgrace.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Glenn Close]] as Marquise Isabelle de Merteuil\n* [[John Malkovich]] as Vicomte S\u00e9bastien de Valmont\n* [[Michelle Pfeiffer]] as Madame Marie de Tourvel\n* [[Uma Thurman]] as C\u00e9cile de Volanges\n* [[Swoosie Kurtz]] as Madame de Volanges, mother of C\u00e9cile and cousin to Merteuil\n* [[Keanu Reeves]] as Le Chevalier Raphael Danceny, suitor to C\u00e9cile\n* [[Mildred Natwick]] as Madame de Rosemonde, Valmont's aunt\n* [[Peter Capaldi]] as Azolan, Valmont's valet\n* [[Valerie Gogan]] as Julie, Madame de Tourvel's chambermaid\n* Laura Benson as \u00c9milie, a courtesan\n* Joe Sheridan as Georges, Madame de Tourvel's footman\n* Joanna Pavlis as Ad\u00e8le, Madame de Rosemonde's maid\n* Harry Jones as Monsieur Armand\n* Fran\u00e7ois Montagut as Belleroche, Merteuil's lover\n{{Div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n''Dangerous Liaisons'' was the first English-language film adaptation of Laclos's novel.
