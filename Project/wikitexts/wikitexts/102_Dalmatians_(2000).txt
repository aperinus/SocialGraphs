Feldman]] and [[Walt Disney Pictures]]. The sequel to the 1996 film ''[[101 Dalmatians (1996 film)|101 Dalmatians]]'', a live-action remake of the [[One Hundred and One Dalmatians|1961 Disney animated film of the same name]], it stars [[Glenn Close]] reprising her role as [[Cruella de Vil]] as she attempts to steal puppies for her \"grandest\" fur coat yet. Glenn Close and [[Tim McInnerny]] were the only two actors from the 1996 film to return for the sequel. The film received generally negative reviews from critics and was unable to achieve the box office success of its predecessor, although the film was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Costume Design]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/oscar/chart/?view=allcategories&yr=2000 |title=Academy Awards 2000 - Winners and nominees by category |website=[[Box Office Mojo]] |access-date=March 12, 2016}}</ref>\n\nA [[prequel]] film in its own continuity, ''[[Cruella (film)|Cruella]]'', was released on May 28, 2021, with [[Emma Stone]] in the title role and Close acting as an executive producer.<ref name=\"continuity_Collider\">{{cite web |url=https://collider.com/cruella-costumes-jenny-beavan-interview/|work=[[Collider (website)|Collider]]|title={{'}}''Cruella''{{'}} Costume Designer Jenny Beavan Explains How She Made Pre-Dalmatian Fashion for the Disney Prequel|author=Radish, Christina|date=May 3, 2021|accessdate=May 25, 2021}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nAfter three years in prison, [[Cruella de Vil]] has been cured of her desire for fur coats by Dr. Pavlov. She is released on probation, but warned that if she breaks parole she will be immediately sent back to prison, as well as be forced to pay the remainder of her fortune, some eight million [[British Pound|pounds]], to all the dog shelters in [[Westminster]]. Cruella therefore mends her working relationship with her much-abused valet Alonzo, and has him lock away all her fur coats, including her sketch of a dalmatian fur coat. Cruella's probation officer, Chloe Simon, is the owner of Dipstick (one of the original 101, bought from the Dalmatian Plantation of Roger and Anita Dearly); she suspects Cruella will strike again.\n\nDipstick's mate, Dottie, gives birth to three puppies: Domino, Little Dipper and Oddball, who appears to be an [[Albinism|albino]] and begins to feel self-conscious about her lack of spots as she grows up.  Cruella buys the Second Chance Dog shelter, owned by Kevin Shepherd, and saves it from insolvency, to restore her reputation. Meanwhile, Dr. Pavlov discovers that when his therapy patients are subjected to loud bell noises, they revert to their former personalities, but he conceals these findings from the public. Inevitably, when [[Big Ben]] rings in her presence, Cruella reverts to her former personality. She enlists the help of French [[furrier]] Jean-Pierre LePelt to steal Dalmatian puppies for a new fur coat with a hood, specifically modifying the original design to use Dipstick's children. \n\nChloe and Kevin go out on a date while their dogs stay home. Kevin tells Chloe that, if Cruella violates her parole, her entire fortune will go to him, since his dog shelter is the only one currently operating in Westminster. Knowing this, Cruella has Kevin framed for the theft of the first ninety-nine puppies LePelt takes, also exploiting the fact that Kevin has a prior record of dog-napping. She invites Chloe and Dipstick to her house for a dinner party, to decoy them away while LePelt steals Dottie and her three puppies. Dipstick hurries back to the apartment and hides in LePelt's truck, but is later captured at the train station. Chloe rushes home to save her pets, but arrives too late. She is joined by Kevin, who has escaped from prison with help from his dogs and talking [[macaw]], Waddlesworth (who thinks he, too, is a dog). Kevin explains that his earlier conviction was for breaking animals out of a lab, where they were being used for experiments.\n\nUpon finding LePelt's lost ticket for the [[Venice-Simplon Orient Express]] to [[Paris]], Kevin and Chloe attempt and fail to stop Cruella and LePelt before they get on the train. Oddball and Waddlesworth manage to get on board the train, and Kevin and Chloe follow to Paris, where they free the adult  dogs before being discovered and locked in a cellar.  Cruella goes after the puppies alone, while Alonzo, having been mistreated beyond his patience, defeats LePelt and frees Kevin and Chloe. They pursue Cruella to a bakery, and find that the puppies, led by Oddball, have tricked Cruella into being baked in an enormous cake. Cruella survives, and she and LePelt are both arrested.\n\nChloe and Kevin, exonerated from the theft accusation, return to [[London]] and are personally awarded the remnants of Cruella's fortune by Alonzo himself. Oddball's coat finally develops a few small spots, much to everyone's surprise.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Glenn Close]] as [[Cruella de Vil]]\n* [[G\u00e9rard Depardieu]] as Jean-Pierre LePelt\n* [[Ioan Gruffudd]] as Kevin Shepherd\n* [[Alice Evans]] as Chloe Simon\n* [[Tim McInnerny]] as Alonzo\n* [[Eric Idle]] as Waddlesworth the [[Scarlet macaw]]\n* [[Ben Crompton]] as Ewan\n* [[Carol MacReady]] as Agnes Wilford \n* [[Jim Carter (actor)|Jim Carter]] as Detective Armstrong \n* [[Ian Richardson]] as Mr. Torte QC\n* [[David Horovitch]] as Dr. Pavlov\n* [[Kerry Shale]] as Le Pelt's Assistant\n* [[Ron Cook]] as Mr. Button\n* [[Timothy West]] as Judge\n\n==Release==\n* On November 24, 1999, a teaser trailer was released with [[Disney/Pixar]]'s ''[[Toy Story 2]]''.\n* On May 19, 2000, a second trailer was released with ''[[Dinosaur (2000 film)|Dinosaur]]''.\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Cruella de Vil Panther.jpg|thumb|A customized [[Panther De Ville]] driven by Cruella de Vil in the film]]\nThe early working title was ''101 Dalmatians Returns.''
