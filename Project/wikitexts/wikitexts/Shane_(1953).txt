A drifter, he is hired as a farmhand by hardscrabble rancher Joe Starrett, who is homesteading with his wife, Marian, and their young son, Joey. Starrett tells Shane that a war of intimidation is being waged on the valley's settlers. Though they have claimed their land legally under the [[Homestead Acts]], a ruthless cattle baron, Rufus Ryker, has hired various rogues and henchmen to harass them and force them out of the valley. \n\t\nShane goes to town alone to buy supplies at Grafton's, a general store with an adjacent saloon. Shane enters the saloon where Ryker's men are drinking and orders a soda pop for Joey. Chris Calloway, one of Ryker's men, ridicules and taunts Shane by throwing his drink on him, but Shane ignores him and leaves. On Shane's next trip to town with the Starretts and other homesteaders, he defeats Calloway, and then he and Starrett win a bar room brawl against most of Ryker's other men.  Ryker promises the next fight will be with guns.  Ryker hires Jack Wilson, an unscrupulous and notoriously skilled gunfighter. Joey admires Shane, much to his mother's chagrin, after Shane demonstrates his shooting skills.\n\nFrank \"Stonewall\" Torrey, a hot-tempered ex-Confederate homesteader, is taunted and forced to draw his gun by Wilson, who then shoots Torrey dead outside the saloon. At Torrey's funeral, the settlers discuss abandoning their struggle and leaving the valley; but after witnessing one of their homesteads being destroyed in a fire set by Ryker's men, they find new resolve to continue the fight.\n\nWith the purpose of killing him, Ryker invites Starrett to a meeting at the saloon, ostensibly to negotiate a settlement. Calloway, no longer loyal to Ryker, warns Shane of the double-cross. Resolved to protect Starrett from an ambush, Shane intervenes, even knocking Starrett unconscious to save him. Shane rides to town with Joey following on foot to watch the fight. Shane kills Wilson, Ryker, and Ryker's brother, but is injured. Outside, Shane sees Joey, who notices that Shane is bleeding. In an iconic closing scene, Shane bids farewell and rides off into the valley, ignoring Joey's desperate cries of \"Shane, come back!\"\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Alan Ladd]] as Shane\n* [[Jean Arthur]] as Marian Starrett\n* [[Van Heflin]] as Joe Starrett\n* [[Brandon deWilde]] as Joey Starrett\n* [[Jack Palance]] as Jack Wilson (as Walter Jack Palance)\n* [[Ben Johnson (actor)|Ben Johnson]] as Chris Calloway\n* [[Edgar Buchanan]] as Fred Lewis\n* [[Emile Meyer]] as Rufus Ryker\n* [[Elisha Cook Jr.]] as Frank \"Stonewall\" Torrey\n* Douglas Spencer as Axel 'Swede' Shipstead\n* [[John Dierkes]] as Morgan Ryker\n* [[Ellen Corby]] as Mrs. Liz Torrey\n* Paul McVey as Sam Grafton, store owner\n* John Miller as Will Atkey, bartender\n* [[Edith Evanson]] as Mrs. Shipstead\n* [[Leonard Strong (actor)|Leonard Strong]] as Ernie Wright\n* Ray Spiker as Axel Johnson \u2013 Homesteader\n* [[Janice Carroll]] as Susan Lewis\n* Martin Mason as Ed Howells\n* Helen Brown as Martha Lewis\n* [[Nancy Kulp]] as Mrs. Howells\n}}\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Eiganotomo-shane-nov1952.jpg|thumb|Behind the scenes of the filming of ''Shane''.]]\n''Shane'' was expensive for a Western movie at the time with a cost of $3.1&nbsp;million.<ref>{{cite news|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|title=Berlin Analyzes Goldwyn's Show-Cents|date=March 10, 1954|page=2|url=https://archive.org/stream/variety193-1954-03#page/n73/mode/1up}}</ref> It was the first film to be projected in \"flat\" [[widescreen]], a format that Paramount invented in order to offer audiences a wider panorama than television could provide.<ref name=\"Weaver, William R. 1953\">{{cite news|last=Weaver|first=William R.|title=All Para.

The fictional town and Starrett homestead were constructed for the film near [[Kelly, Wyoming|Kelly]], in the [[Jackson Hole]] valley, and demolished after filming was completed. One vintage structure that appeared briefly in the film, the Ernie Wright Cabin (now popularly referred to by locals as the \"Shane Cabin\") still stands, but is steadily deteriorating due to its classification as \"ruins\" by the [[National Park Service]].<ref>[https://www.bestofthetetons.com/2016/05/30/shane-movie-locations/ ''Shane'' Movie Locations] at bestofthetetons.com, retrieved March 7, 2017.</ref>\n\nLadd disliked and was uncomfortable with guns; Shane's shooting demonstration for Joey required 116 takes.<ref name=TCM1>[http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/16406/Shane/trivia.html Turner Classic Movies, TCM.com, \"'Shane' (1953) \u2013 Trivia\"] Retrieved August 8, 2015</ref> A careful review of Shane's gun skill demonstration to Joey shows Alan Ladd firing with his eyes closed. Later, in the saloon battle, Ladd's pistol is pointed well away from the man he shoots, especially the final scene where he kills Ryker's brother. Palance was nervous around horses, and had great difficulty with mounting and dismounting. After very many attempts, he finally executed a flawless dismount, which Stevens then used for all of the Wilson character's dismounts and\u2014run in reverse\u2014his mounts as well. Palance looked so awkward on horseback that Stevens was forced to replace Wilson's introductory ride into town astride his galloping horse with Palance riding at walking pace.{{sfn|Hyams|1984|page=116}}  Stevens later noted that the change actually made Wilson's entrance more dramatic and menacing.<ref>[http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/great-movie-shane-1953 ''Shane''] at [[RogerEbert.com]], retrieved April 7, 2017.</ref>\n\nThe final scene, in which the wounded Shane explains to a distraught Joey why he has to leave (\"There's no living with a killing\"), was a moving moment for the entire cast and crew, except Brandon deWilde. \"Every time Ladd spoke his lines of farewell, deWilde crossed his eyes and stuck out his tongue, making Ladd laugh.

Frank Freeman]] for a list of available actors with current contracts; within three minutes he chose Alan Ladd, Van Heflin, and Jean Arthur. ''Shane'' was Arthur's first cinematic role in five years, and her last, at the age of 50\u2014though she later appeared in theater, and a short-lived television series. She accepted the part at the request of Stevens, who had directed her in ''[[The Talk of the Town (1942 film)|The Talk of the Town]]'' (1942) with [[Cary Grant]] and [[Ronald Colman]], and ''[[The More the Merrier]]'' (1943) for which she received her only [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] nomination.{{sfn|Brady|1950a|page=42}}\n\nWhen asked if he enjoyed the movie, the author of ''Shane'', Jack Schaefer, replied, \u201cYeah, I did, all except for that runt\", referring to the {{convert|5|ft|6|in|cm|spell=in|adj=on}} Ladd.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Boyle|first=Molly|title=Writer from nowhere: How Jack Schaefer found the West in himself|url=https://www.santafenewmexican.com/pasatiempo/books/writer-from-nowhere-how-jack-schaefer-found-the-west-in-himself/article_689b1606-15e7-590b-91e5-027f431a42ef.html|access-date=January 21, 2021|website=Santa Fe New Mexican|language=en}}</ref> In 1989 Schaefer told the Oberlin alumni magazine that his ''Shane'' character was supposed to be a \u201cdark, deadly person\" who he had hoped would be played by [[George Raft]].<ref>{{Cite web|date=April 15, 2007|title=Lakewood Lore \u2013 Jack Schaefer|url=http://www.lkwdpl.org/lore/lore147.htm|access-date=January 21, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070415052401/http://www.lkwdpl.org/lore/lore147.htm|archive-date=April 15, 2007}}</ref>\n\n===Technical details===\nAlthough the film was shot using the standard 1.37:1 [[Academy ratio]], Paramount picked ''Shane'' to debut their new wide-screen system because it was composed largely of long and medium shots that would not be compromised by cropping the image. Using a newly cut aperture plate in the [[movie projector]], as well as a wider-angle lens, the film was exhibited in first-run venues at an aspect ratio of 1.66:1. For its premier, the studio replaced the 34-by-25-foot screen in [[Radio City Music Hall]] with one measuring 50 feet wide by 30 feet high.<ref>\"Hall Alters Projection Equipment for 'Shane'\". ''Motion Picture Daily'', April 8, 1953.</ref>{{sfn|Lev|2003|page=116}} Paramount produced all of its subsequent films at that ratio until 1954, when they switched to 1.85:1.<ref name=\"Weaver, William R. 1953\"/>  ''Shane'' was originally released in April 1953 with a conventional [[Sound-on-film|optical soundtrack]]; but as its popularity grew, a new three-track, stereophonic soundtrack was recorded and played on an interlocking 35mm magnetic reel in the projection booth.<ref>\"Midwest 'Shane' Premiere at Lake\". ''Motion Picture Daily'', May 13, 1953.</ref>\n\nStevens wanted to demonstrate to audiences \"the horrors of violence\". To emphasize the terrible power of gunshots, he created a cannon-like sound effect by firing a large-calibre weapon into a garbage can. In addition, he had the two principal shooting victims\u2014Palance and Elisha Cook Jr.\u2014rigged with hidden wires that jerked them violently backward when shot. These innovations, according to film historian Jay Hyams, marked the beginning of graphic violence in Western movies.  He quotes [[Sam Peckinpah]]: \"When Jack Palance shot Elisha Cook Jr. in ''Shane'', things started to change.\"{{sfn|Hyams|1984|page=115}}\n\n==Reception==\n{{quote box|align=right|width=25em|quote=\"That's just what I need \u2013 to get advice from a guy who never saw ''Shane''.\"|source=\u2014[[Henry Winkler]] as Arthur Fonzarelli, ''[[Happy Days]]''{{sfn|Hyams|1984|page=115}} }}\n\n''Shane'' premiered in New York City at [[Radio City Music Hall]] on April 23, 1953,{{sfn|Lev|2003|page=116}} and grossed $114,000 in its four weeks there.<ref>\"'Wax,' 'Shane' End Sturdy B'Way Runs\".

He continued:\n{{blockquote|''Shane'' contains something more than the beauty and the grandeur of the mountains and plains, drenched by the brilliant Western sunshine and the violent, torrential, black-browed rains. It contains a tremendous comprehension of the bitterness and passion of the feuds that existed between the new homesteaders and the cattlemen on the open range. It contains a disturbing revelation of the savagery that prevailed in the hearts of the old gun-fighters, who were simply legal killers under the frontier code. And it also contains a very wonderful understanding of the spirit of a little boy amid all the tensions and excitements and adventures of a frontier home.}}\nCrowther called \"the concept and the presence\" of Joey, the little boy played by Brandon deWilde, \"key to permit[ting] a refreshing viewpoint on material that's not exactly new.
