It was shown in the Midnight Screenings section at the [[2016 Cannes Film Festival]].<ref name=\"IW\">{{cite web |url=http://www.indiewire.com/article/cannes-live-stream-2016-film-festival-lineup-list |title=2016 Cannes Film Festival Announces Lineup |accessdate=April 15, 2016 |work=IndieWire}}</ref><ref name=\"VarCannes\">{{cite web |url=https://variety.com/2016/film/festivals/cannes-film-festival-official-selection-lineup-2016-1201753269/ |title=Cannes 2016: Film Festival Unveils Official Selection Lineup |accessdate=April 15, 2016 |work=Variety}}</ref> The film was released by [[Amazon Studios]] and [[Magnolia Pictures]] on October 28, 2016.\n\n==Overview==\nThe film follows the rise, fall and reunion of [[the Stooges]], formed in [[Ann Arbor, Michigan]] in the 1967 by singer [[Iggy Pop]], bassist [[Dave Alexander (musician)|Dave Alexander]], and brothers [[Ron Asheton]] and [[Scott Asheton]] on guitar and drums respectively. Guitarist [[James Williamson (musician)|James Williamson]] eventually joined the band, with Ron Asheton switching to bass after Alexander was fired.\n\nThe band found little success during the first phase of their career, recording three albums that did not sell as well as their record companies expected, and performing for audiences that were largely indifferent or hostile. They broke up in 1974, and the band members went their separate ways with vocalist Pop establishing a moderately successful solo career. In time, the Stooges proved highly influential on the development of [[punk rock]] in the 1970s.\n\nThe Stooges' original lineup reformed in 2003, with bassist [[Mike Watt]] replacing the late Alexander. Ron Asheton died in 2009, and Williamson rejoined the band for their fifth and final album.\n\n==Development and production==\nJarmusch began working on the documentary almost a decade prior to the film's release. The project began after Osterberg expressed that if a film were to be made about The Stooges, he would prefer Jarmusch to make it.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXBl6y-N490&t=182s |title=Jim Jarmusch & Iggy Pop 'Gimme Danger' Q&A |website=YouTube |publisher=Film Society of Lincoln Center|access-date=March 11, 2019}}</ref>\n\n''Gimme Danger'' mixes archival photos and footage and [[cutout animation|cutout style animation]] alongside reunion-era interviews with the surviving band members and footage of their 2010 induction into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]].
