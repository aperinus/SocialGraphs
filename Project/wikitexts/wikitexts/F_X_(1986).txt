It also makes the sound {{IPAc-en|k|\u0283}} in words ending in ''-xion'' (except for ''axion''). When {{angbr|x}} ends a word, it is always {{IPAc-en|k|s}} (e.g. ''fax''), except in loan words such as ''faux'' (see French, below).\n\nThere are very few English words that start with {{angbr|x}} (the fewest of any letter). When {{angbr|x}} does start a word, it is usually pronounced 'z' (e.g. ''xylophone'', ''xenophobia'', and ''xanthan''). When starting in some names or as its own representation it is pronounced 'eks', in rare recent loanwords or foreign proper names, it can also be pronounced {{IPAc-en|s}} (e.g. the obsolete Vietnamese monetary unit ''[[wiktionary:xu|xu]]'') or {{IPAc-en|\u0283}} (e.g. Chinese names starting with Xi like [[Xiaomi]] or [[Xinjiang]]). Many of the words that start with {{angbr|x}} are of [[Greek language|Greek]] origin, or standardized trademarks (''[[Xerox]]'') or acronyms (''XC''). In abbreviations, it can represent \"trans-\" (e.g. ''XMIT'' for transmit, ''XFER'' for transfer), \"cross-\" (e.g. ''X-ing'' for crossing, ''XREF'' for [[cross-reference]]), \"Christ-\"  (e.g. ''Xmas'' for Christmas, ''Xian'' for Christian), the \"crys-\" in crystal (''XTAL''), or various words starting with \"ex-\" (e.g. ''XL'' for extra large, ''XOR'' for [[Exclusive disjunction|exclusive-or]]).\n\nX is the [[Letter frequency|third least frequently used letter]] in English (after {{angbr|q}} and {{angbr|z}}), with a frequency of about 0.15% in words.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite web |last=Mi\u010dka |first=Pavel |title=Letter frequency (English) |url=http://en.algoritmy.net/article/40379/Letter-frequency-English |website=Algoritmy.net |access-date=9 February 2014 |archive-date=4 March 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210304152631/http://en.algoritmy.net/article/40379/Letter-frequency-English |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n===Other languages===\nIn Latin, {{angbr|x}} stood for {{IPA|[ks]}}. In some languages, as a result of assorted phonetic changes, handwriting adaptations or simply spelling convention, {{angbr|x}} has other pronunciations:\n*In [[Basque language|Basque]], {{angbr|x}} represents {{IPA|[\u0283]}}. Additionally there is the digraph {{angbr|tx}} {{IPA|[t\u0283]}}.\n*In [[Dutch language|Dutch]], {{angbr|x}} usually represents {{IPA|[ks]}}, except in the name of the island of [[Texel]], which is pronounced ''Tessel''. This is because of [[Dutch language#Historical sound changes|historical sound-changes in Dutch]], where all {{IPA|/ks/}} sounds have been replaced by {{IPA|/s/}} sounds. Words with an {{angbr|x}} in the Dutch language are nowadays usually [[loanword]]s. In the [[Languages of Belgium|Dutch-speaking part of Belgium]], [[family name]]s with {{angbr|x}} are not uncommon (e.g. Dierckx, Hendrickx, Koninckx, Sterckx, Vranckx).\n*In [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]], {{angbr|x}} is generally pronounced {{IPA|[ks]}}, but since the 19th century, there has been a tendency to spell it out as {{angbr|ks}}; it may still be retained in personal names, though it is fairly rare, and occurs mostly in foreign words and [[SMS language]]. Usage in [[Danish language|Danish]] and [[Finnish language|Finnish]] is similar (while [[Swedish language|Swedish]], on the other hand, makes frequent use of {{angbr|x}} in native words as well as in loanwords).\n*In [[German language|German]], generally pronounced {{IPA|[ks]}}; in native words, however, such as ''Ochs'' or ''wachsen'',  the cluster {{IPA|[ks]}} is often written {{angbr|chs}}.\n*{{lang-fr|at the ends of words}}, silent (or {{IPA|[z]}} in [[Liaison (French)|liaison]] if the next word starts with a vowel). Three exceptions are pronounced {{IPA|[s]}}: ''six'' (\"six\"), ''dix'' (\"ten\") and in some city names such as ''[[Brussels|Bruxelles]]'' (although some people pronounce it 'ks') or ''[[Auxerre]]''; it is fully pronounced {{IPA|[ks]}} in [[Aix (disambiguation)|Aix]], the name of several towns. It is pronounced {{IPA|[z]}} in ''sixi\u00e8me'' and ''dixi\u00e8me''. Otherwise {{IPA|[ks]}} or (primarily in words beginning with ex- followed by a vowel) {{IPA|[\u0261z]}}.\n*In [[Italian language|Italian]], {{angbr|x}} is either pronounced {{IPA|[ks]}}, as in ''extra'', ''uxorio'', ''xilofono'',<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dizionario.rai.it |title=Dizionario di ortografia e pronunzia |trans-title=Dictionary of Spelling and Pronunciation |language=it |website=Dizionario di ortografia e pronunzia |access-date=9 February 2014 |archive-date=16 April 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180416110248/http://www.dizionario.rai.it/ |url-status=live }}</ref> or {{IPA|[\u0261z]}}, as ''exogamia'', when it is preceded by {{angbr|e}} and followed by a vowel. In several related languages, notably Venetian, it represents the voiced sibilant {{IPA|[z]}}. It is also used, mainly amongst the young people, as a short written form for \"per\", meaning \"for\": for example, \"x sempre\" (\"forever\"). This is because in Italian the [[\u00d7|multiplication sign]] (similar to {{angbr|x}}) is called \"per\". However, {{angbr|x}} is found only in [[loanword]]s, as it is not part of the standard [[Italian alphabet]]; in most words with {{angbr|x}}, this letter may be replaced with 's' or 'ss' (with different pronunciation: ''xilofono/silofono'', ''taxi/tass\u00ec'') or, rarely, by 'cs' (with the same pronunciation: ''claxon/[[:it:clacson|clacson]]'').\n*In [[Old Spanish]], {{angbr|x}} was pronounced {{IPA|[\u0283]}}, as it is still currently in other [[Iberian Romance languages]]. Later, the sound evolved to a hard {{IPA|[x]}} sound. In modern [[Spanish language|Spanish]], due to a spelling reform, whenever {{angbr|x}} is used for the {{IPA|[x]}} sound it has been replaced with {{angbr|j}}, including in words that originally had {{angbr|x}} such as ''ejemplo'' or ''ejercicio'', though {{angbr|x}} is still retained for some names (notably 'M\u00e9xico', even though 'M\u00e9jico' may sometimes be used in Spain). Presently, {{angbr|x}} represents the sound {{IPA|[s]}} (word-initially), or the consonant cluster {{IPA|[ks]}} (e.g. ''ox\u00edgeno, examen''). Rarely, it can be pronounced {{IPA|[\u0283]}} as in Old Spanish in some proper nouns such as 'Raxel' (a variant of [[Rachel]]) and ''[[Uxmal]]''.\n*In [[Galician language|Galician]] and [[Leonese language|Leonese]], {{angbr|x}} is pronounced {{IPA|[\u0283]}} in most cases (often used in place of etymological ''g'' or ''j''). The pronunciation {{IPA|[ks]}} occurs in learned words, such as '<nowiki/>''taxativo''<nowiki/>' (taxing). However, Galician speakers tend to pronounce it {{IPA|[s]}}, especially when it appears before plosives, such as in '''externo''<nowiki/>' (external).\n*In [[Catalan language|Catalan]], {{angbr|x}} has three sounds; the most common is {{IPA|[\u0283]}}; as in 'xarop' (syrup). Other sounds are: {{IPA|[ks]}}; 'fixar' (to fix), {{IPA|[\u0261z]}}; 'examen'. In addition, {{IPA|[\u0283]}} gets voiced to {{IPA|[\u0292]}} before voiced consonants; 'caixmir'. Catalan also has the digraph {{angbr|tx}}, pronounced {{IPA|[t\u0283]}}.\n*In [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], {{angbr|x}} has four main sounds; the most common is {{IPA|[\u0283]}}, as in 'x\u00edcara' (cup). The other sounds are: {{IPA|[ks]}} as in 'flex\u00e3o' (flexion); {{IPA|[s]}}, when preceded by E and followed by a consonant, as in 'contexto' ({{IPA|[\u0283]}} in European Portuguese), and in a small number of other words, such as 'pr\u00f3ximo' (close/next); and (the rarest) {{IPA|[z]}}, which occurs in the prefix 'ex-' before a vowel, as in 'exagerado' (exaggerated). A rare fifth sound is {{IPA|[\u0261z]}}, coexisting with {{IPA|[z]}} and {{IPA|[ks]}} as acceptable pronunciations in ''exantema'' and in words with the Greek prefix 'hexa-'.\n*In [[Sardinian language|Sardinian]] and [[Ligurian (Romance language)|Ligurian]], X represents {{IPA|[\u0292]}}.\n*In [[Venetian language|Venetian]], it represents the voiced alveolar sibilant {{IPA|[z]}} much like in Portuguese 'exagerado', English 'xylophone' or in the French 'sixi\u00e8me'. Examples from medieval texts include ''raxon'' (reason), ''prexon'' (prison), ''dexerto'' (desert), ''chaxa'' or ''caxa'' (home). Nowadays, the best-known word is ''xe'' (is/are). The most notable exception to this rule is the name ''Venexia'' {{IPA|[ve\u02c8n\u025bsja]}} in which {{angbr|x}} has evolved from the initial voiced sibilant {{IPA|[z]}} to the present day voiceless sibilant.\n*In [[Albanian language|Albanian]], {{angbr|x}} represents {{IPA|[dz]}}, while the [[Digraph (orthography)|digraph]] {{angbr|xh}} represents {{IPA|[d\u0292]}}.\n*In [[Maltese language|Maltese]], {{angbr|x}} is pronounced {{IPA|[\u0283]}} or, in some cases, {{IPA|[\u0292]}} (only in loanwords such as 'televixin', and not for all speakers).\n*In [[Polish language|Polish]], {{angbr|x}} was used prior to 19th century both in loanwords and native words and was pronounced {{IPA|[ks]}} or {{IPA|[\u0261z]}}, e.g. ''xi\u0105\u017c\u0119'', ''xi\u0119stwo'' (now ''ksi\u0105\u017c\u0119'', ''ksi\u0119stwo'').
