It stars [[Saffron Burrows]], [[Thomas Jane]], [[Samuel L. Jackson]], [[Michael Rapaport]], and [[LL Cool J]]. Set in an isolated underwater facility, the film follows a team of scientists and their research on [[Shortfin mako shark|mako sharks]] to help fight [[Alzheimer's disease]]. The situation plunges into chaos when multiple [[Genetic engineering|genetically engineered]] sharks go on a rampage and flood the facility.\n\n''Deep Blue Sea'' had a production budget of $60\u201382 million and represented a test for Harlin, who had not made a commercially successful film since ''[[Cliffhanger (film)|Cliffhanger]]'' in 1993. The film was primarily shot at Fox Baja Studios in [[Rosarito, Mexico]], where the production team constructed sets above the large water tanks that had been built for [[James Cameron]]'s 1997 film ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]''. Although ''Deep Blue Sea'' features some shots of real sharks, most of the sharks used in the film were either [[Animatronics|animatronic]] or [[Computer graphics|computer generated]]. [[Trevor Rabin]] composed the [[film score]]; LL Cool J contributed two songs to the film: \"Deepest Bluest (Shark's Fin)\" and \"[[Say What (LL Cool J song)|Say What]]\".\n\nReleased in theaters during the summer season, ''Deep Blue Sea'' grossed over $165 million worldwide. It received generally mixed reviews from critics, who praised its suspense, pacing, and action sequences, but criticized its unoriginality and [[B movie]] conventions. Retrospectively, ''Deep Blue Sea'' has been regarded as a successful shark film, especially within a limited genre that has been dominated by [[Steven Spielberg]]'s 1975 thriller ''[[Jaws (film)|Jaws]]''. A [[direct-to-video]] sequel, ''[[Deep Blue Sea 2]]'', was released in 2018. A third film, ''[[Deep Blue Sea 3]]'', was released on July 28, 2020.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for films should be 400-700 words. -->\nIn a remote underwater facility, doctors Susan McCallister and Jim Whitlock are conducting research on [[Shortfin mako shark|mako sharks]] to help in the re-activation of dormant human brain cells like those found in [[Alzheimer's disease]] patients. After one of the sharks escapes the facility and attempts to attack a boat full of young adults, financial backers send corporate executive Russell Franklin to investigate the facility.\n\nSusan and Jim prove their research is working by testing a certain [[protein complex]] that was removed from the brain tissue of their largest shark, which bites off Jim's right arm upon awakening in the laboratory. Brenda Kerns, the tower's operator, calls a helicopter that braves heavy rain and strong winds to evacuate Jim, but as he is being lifted, the cable jams, dropping Jim and his stretcher into the shark pen. The largest shark grabs the stretcher and pulls the helicopter into the tower, killing Brenda and the pilots, as well as causing massive explosions that severely damage the facility.\n\nIn the laboratory, Susan, Franklin, wrangler Carter Blake, marine biologist Janice Higgins, and engineer Tom Scoggins witness the shark smash the stretcher against the laboratory's main window, which then shatters, [[drowning]] Jim and flooding the facility. The group goes to the facility's wet entry, where they plan to take a [[submersible]] to escape. Susan confesses to the others that she and Jim [[Genetic engineering|genetically engineered]] the sharks to increase their brain size, as they were not large enough to harvest sufficient amounts of the protein complex; this had the side effect of making them smarter and more deadly. When the group reaches the wet entry, they discover that the submersible has been damaged. While delivering a monologue emphasizing the need for group unity, Franklin is dragged into the submersible pool by one of the sharks and devoured.\n\nThe remaining crew opt to climb up the elevator shaft at the risk of [[pressure|destabilizing]] the pool. As they climb, explosive tremors cause the ladder to break, and Janice loses her grip and falls into the shark-infested water. Despite Carter's attempt to save her, one of the two remaining sharks drags Janice under, killing and devouring her. In the facility's kitchen, which has been partially flooded, cook Sherman \"Preacher\" Dudley, whose parrot is devoured in the process, manages to kill the first shark with an explosion. He then makes his way to the elevator shaft, where he encounters Carter, Scoggins, and Susan. Carter and Scoggins go to the flooded laboratory to activate a control panel that drains a stairway to the surface, while Susan heads to her room to collect her research material. Carter and Scoggins reach the control panel, but the largest shark storms in, killing and ripping Scoggins apart, and sabotaging the controls. In the other room, Susan encounters another shark, and electrocutes it with a power cable, destroying her research in the process.\n\nAfter regrouping, Carter, Susan, and Preacher go to a [[Diving chamber|decompression chamber]] and swim to the surface. Preacher is grabbed by the last shark, but is released when he stabs the shark in the eye with his crucifix, though he escapes with injuries to his leg. Carter realizes that the sharks made them flood the facility, so they could escape through the weaker mesh fences at the surface. In an effort to distract the shark from escaping to the open sea, Susan deliberately cuts her hand and dives into the water. Although she manages to distract the shark with her blood, she is unable to get out of the water, and is devoured, despite Carter's efforts to save her. While Carter is grabbing hold of the shark's dorsal fin, Preacher shoots the shark with a [[harpoon]], but also pierces Carter's thigh. As the shark breaks through the fence, Carter orders Preacher to connect the trailing wire to a battery, sending an electric current through the wire and to an explosive charge in the harpoon, killing the shark. In the end, Carter reveals that he had managed to free himself in time, and joins Preacher to see a worker's boat en route on the horizon.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Saffron Burrows]] as Dr. Susan McCallister\n* [[Thomas Jane]] as Carter Blake\n* [[LL Cool J]] as Sherman \"Preacher\" Dudley\n* [[Jacqueline McKenzie]] as Janice \"Jan\" Higgins\n* [[Michael Rapaport]] as Tom Scoggins\n* [[Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd]] as Dr. Jim Whitlock\n* [[Aida Turturro]] as Brenda Kerns\n* [[Samuel L. Jackson]] as Russell Franklin\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nThe story of ''Deep Blue Sea'' was conceived by Australian screenwriter Duncan Kennedy after he witnessed the result of a \"horrific\" shark attack on a beach near his home.<ref name=\"LAT article\"/> The tragedy contributed to a recurring [[nightmare]] of him \"being in a passageway with sharks that could read his mind\".<ref name=\"LAT article\"/> This motivated him to write a [[spec script]], while acknowledging the challenge of approaching a shark film without repeating [[Steven Spielberg]]'s 1975 thriller ''[[Jaws (film)|Jaws]]''.<ref name=\"LAT article\"/> Although [[Warner Bros.]] bought the script in late 1994,<ref name=\"Arrow interview\"/> actual development on the project did not start until two years later.<ref name=\"Production Notes 1\"/> When [[Renny Harlin]] was chosen to direct the film, Kennedy's screenplay, which had already been re-written by several writers at Warner Bros., was presented to Donna Powers and Wayne Powers, who turned it into the film's final script.<ref name=\"Arrow interview\"/> According to Wayne, \"The movie became essentially what we wrote. The draft we were first presented by [Warner Bros.] was much more of a [[military espionage]], high-tech [[Action film|action movie]], [[grenade launcher]]s, that kind of thing. We wanted our team to include more [[Blue-collar worker|blue-collar types]] and not to have weapons to fight back, to play it more as a [[horror film]].\"<ref name=\"Arrow interview\"/>\n\n''Deep Blue Sea'' had a budget of $82 million and represented a test for Harlin, who had not made a commercially successful film since ''[[Cliffhanger (film)|Cliffhanger]]'' in 1993.<ref name=\"LAT article\"/> Harlin's main goal was to bring the horror genre back to the serious and high-budget production values of films like ''[[The Exorcist (film)|The Exorcist]]'', ''Jaws'', ''[[The Shining (film)|The Shining]]'', as opposed to the [[tongue-in-cheek]] style of subsequent films in the genre.<ref name=\"Reading Eagle article\"/> [[Ridley Scott]]'s 1979 film ''[[Alien (film)|Alien]]'' was an influence on the [[Casting (performing arts)|casting]] process, as Harlin wanted to cast the characters in a way as to make it impossible for the audience to know who was going to die or survive.<ref name=\"Reading Eagle article\"/> To achieve this, he combined relatively unknown actors who could deliver solid performances and meet the physical demands of the diving and stunts with a star, [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nominee [[Samuel L. Jackson]], who \"anchors the whole piece\".<ref name=\"Reading Eagle article\"/><ref name=\"Production Notes 2\"/> Harlin also forced the studio into hiring rapper [[LL Cool J]] because he wanted a character who could bring \"a lot of warmth and humor to the film without it being joke-type humor\".<ref name=\"Reading Eagle article\"/>\n\n===Filming===\n[[Principal photography]] for ''Deep Blue Sea'' began on August 3, 1998.<ref name=\"Production Notes 4\"/> Most of the film was shot at Fox Baja Studios in [[Rosarito, Mexico]], where the production team constructed sets above the large water tanks that had been built for [[James Cameron]]'s 1997 film ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]''.<ref name=\"Production Notes 4\"/> Some of the sets were designed so that they could be submerged, while others were built on [[sound stage]]s with [[fishtank]]s used as windows.<ref name=\"DVD commentary\"/> At Fox Baja Studios, the cast worked with sharks that were either [[Animatronics|animatronic]] or [[Computer graphics|computer generated]].<ref name=\"EW sharks\"/> As the shark used in ''Jaws'' was 25 feet long, Harlin decided to increase their animatronic shark to 26 feet.<ref name=\"LAT article\"/> Jackson recalled, \"When they first brought it into the lab we were all in awe of the size of this machine [...] It was a real monster. I would walk up to it slowly and touch it and they said it felt like a real shark. The gills moved and it had a mind of its own sometimes.\"<ref name=\"Jackson interview\"/> As an added homage to ''Jaws'', the [[license plate]] pulled from the shark's teeth by Carter is the same plate found in the [[tiger shark]] carcass from Spielberg's film.<ref name=\"License plate\"/>\n\nAfter the shoot at Fox Baja Studios wrapped, Harlin insisted the team go to [[The Bahamas]] to shoot with real sharks.<ref name=\"EW sharks\"/> Recounting his experience there, actor [[Thomas Jane]], who played shark wrangler Carter, said, \"The first day, I was in a cage, but the next day, they swam me 30 feet down... Then this guy yanks the breather off me and the water's churning with blood and guts and stuff... It was so terrifying that I don't want to remember it.\"<ref name=\"EW sharks\"/> The idea was to mix footage of real sharks with animatronic and computer generated sharks to ensure a seamless transition between them all.<ref name=\"Production Notes 3\"/> To distinguish ''Deep Blue Sea'' from ''Jaws'', where the shark is frequently hidden, Harlin decided to show theirs more prominently because he felt that audience expectations had changed since then.<ref name=\"IGN interview\"/><ref name=\"Reading Eagle article\"/>\n\nThe scene where the cast is trying to get back to the elevator after hooking up actor [[Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd]] to the helicopter is actually an accident that made it into the finished film.<ref name=\"Jackson interview\"/> As Jackson explained, \"At one point three [[ton]]s of water got thrown on us by accident and we got swept toward those cargo bays and everyone thought we were going into the drink and people were tumbling around this metal grating [...] We scrambled up and kept acting [...] That was not supposed to happen and we didn't have safety harnesses on and we were flailing around on this deck.\"<ref name=\"Jackson interview\"/> Jackson was initially offered the role played by LL Cool J, but his management team did not like the idea of him playing a chef, so Harlin created the role of Russell Franklin for him.<ref name=\"DVD commentary\"/> Additionally, LL Cool J's character was supposed to die early on, but the director ultimately decided to keep him.<ref name=\"Reading Eagle article\"/> The production team could not afford to have a fully trained [[parrot]] for LL Cool J's character, so they used two parrots: one that was good at flying, and another that could sit on his shoulder.<ref name=\"DVD commentary\"/>\n\n[[File:Deep Blue Sea 1999 deleted shot.jpg|right|150px|thumb|A [[deleted scene]] from the film's ending]]\n\nThe film's ending was changed shortly before its theatrical release. Originally, Burrows's character would escape the shark infested water and live. However, the [[test audience]], who saw the film less than a month before its release, disapproved of the ending because she was behind the shark experiments and was seen as the film's [[villain]].<ref name=\"Original ending\"/> As a result, the production team did a one-day reshoot in the [[Universal Studios]] tank and did some computer generated work on the sharks to change it.<ref name=\"Original ending\"/> In 2009, Harlin explained that ''Deep Blue Sea'' was the hardest film he had ever made because most of the shooting days involved the team standing in water or being under water for long periods.<ref name=\"DoG interview\"/> According to him, \"Just the practicality of putting a wet suit on in the morning, being in the water all day. Your script, all your paperwork has to be made of plastic paper. And things that you wouldn't think would ever float, they float. [...] Or then things that you hope would float actually sink and you can't find them anywhere.\"<ref name=\"DoG interview\"/>\n\n===Music===\nThe [[film score]] for ''Deep Blue Sea'' was composed by [[Trevor Rabin]]. Rabin's music ranges from [[orchestra]]l and [[Choir|choral]] arrangements to [[electronic music|electronic]] soundscapes, and was noted for its use of both dramatic and easily accessible themes.<ref name=\"Filmtracks review\"/> The soundtrack features two songs by LL Cool J{{em dash}}\"Deepest Bluest (Shark's Fin)\" and \"[[Say What (LL Cool J song)|Say What]]\"{{em dash}}which were used in the end credits.<ref name=\"MTV soundtrack\"/> Two [[soundtrack album]]s were also released for the film. The first album, ''[[Deep Blue Sea (soundtrack)|Deep Blue Sea: Music from the Motion Picture]]'', was released on August 3, 1999 by [[Warner Bros. Records]] and features a set of [[hip hop]] and [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]] tracks by several artists, including [[Hi-C (rapper)|Hi-C]], [[Cormega]], and Bass Odyssey.<ref name=\"MTV soundtrack\"/> The second album, ''Deep Blue Sea: Original Motion Picture Score'', was released on August 24, 1999 by [[Var\u00e8se Sarabande]] and contains musical tracks by Rabin.<ref name=\"Filmtracks review\"/>\n\n==Release==\n===Box office===\n''Deep Blue Sea'' performed well when it opened on July 30, 1999 in 2,854 theaters,<ref name=\"Box Office Mojo\"/> finishing third and grossing around $18.6 million at the US weekend box office.<ref name=\"Opening weekend\"/> During its second weekend, the film grossed an estimated $11 million and finished in fifth place, behind ''[[The Sixth Sense]]'', ''[[The Blair Witch Project]]'', ''[[Runaway Bride (film)|Runaway Bride]]'', and ''[[The Thomas Crown Affair (1999 film)|The Thomas Crown Affair]]''.<ref name=\"Second weekend\"/> ''Deep Blue Sea'' grossed over $73.7 million the United States and Canada and $91.4 million internationally, grossing over $165 million worldwide.<ref name=\"Numbers\"/> The film's performance was compared to [[Stephen Sommers]]'s ''[[The Mummy (1999 film)|The Mummy]]'' and [[Jan de Bont]]'s ''[[The Haunting (1999 film)|The Haunting]]'', which had a similar budget and made a significant impact on the box office in the summer of 1999.<ref name=\"Horror Zone\"/>\n\n===Critical response===\n''Deep Blue Sea'' received mixed reviews from critics.<ref name=\"DBS celebration\"/> Review aggregator [[Rotten Tomatoes]] gives the film a \"Fresh\" 60% rating, based on 114 reviews. The critics consensus reads, \"''Deep Blue Sea'' is no ''Jaws'', but action fans seeking some toothy action can certainly do - and almost certainly have done - far worse for B-movie thrills.\"<ref name=\"Rotten Tomatoes\"/> On [[Metacritic]], the film has a score of 54 out of 100, based on reviews from 22 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".<ref name=\"Metacritic\"/> Audiences polled by [[CinemaScore]] gave the film an average grade of \"B\" on an A+ to F scale.<ref name=\"CinemaScore\"/> Writing for ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'', [[Roger Ebert]] gave the film three out of four stars and praised it as \"a skillful [[Thriller film|thriller]]\", saying that ''Deep Blue Sea'' \"is essentially one well-done action sequence after another [...] It doesn't linger on the special effects (some of the sharks look like cartoons), but it knows how to use timing, suspense, quick movement and [especially] surprise\".<ref name=\"Ebert review\"/> He concluded that the film keeps spectators guessing in an otherwise predictable genre.<ref name=\"Ebert review\"/>\n\nIn a positive review, [[Kenneth Turan]] of ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' considered ''Deep Blue Sea'' a return to form for Harlin, especially after the \"dismal swamps\" of ''[[Cutthroat Island]]'' and ''[[The Long Kiss Goodnight]]''.<ref name=\"LAT review\"/> He described the film as \"an example of how expert action filmmaking and up-to-the-minute visual effects can transcend a workmanlike script and bring excitement to conventional genre material\".<ref name=\"LAT review\"/> Similarly, [[Desson Howe]] of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' remarked that, while the film's premise feels familiar, it \"knows its audience and knows what'll get them going&nbsp;\u2013 and even wondering\".<ref name=\"TWP review\"/> He said that ''Deep Blue Sea'' might not be Harlin's finest two hours, but he managed to build \"something that, if nothing else, gives you a great big shock every few minutes\".<ref name=\"TWP review\"/> In a three-and-a-half out of four review, Robert Lasowski of ''[[The Florida Times-Union]]'' highly praised the film's pacing, intense action, and chase scenes, stating that ''Deep Blue Sea'' is \"a great popcorn movie\" and \"what summer at the cineplex is all about\".<ref name=\"FTU review\"/>\n\nOther reviews were less enthusiastic.<ref name=\"SFGate review\"/><ref name=\"NYT review\"/><ref name=\"CT review\"/><ref name=\"Empire review\"/> Writing for ''[[The New York Times]]'', [[Stephen Holden]] described ''Deep Blue Sea'' as \"a cut-rate ''Titanic'' stripped of romance and historical resonance and fused with ''Jaws'', shorn of mythic symbolism and without complex characters\",<ref name=\"NYT review\"/> while Barbara Shulgasser of ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' criticized it for being an inferior imitation of ''[[Jurassic Park (film)|Jurassic Park]]'', but praised LL Cool J's performance and the film's realistic setting.<ref name=\"CT review\"/> Ian Nathan of the British magazine ''[[Empire (film magazine)|Empire]]'' gave the film three out of five stars and criticized its [[B movie]] conventions, stating that \"You're never entirely sure whether you're laughing at or with ''Deep Blue Sea''.\"<ref name=\"Empire review\"/> ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' reviewer Robert Koehler felt the computer generated sharks were inconsistently realized, but nevertheless highlighted the flooding of the facility very positively.<ref name=\"Variety review\"/> The dialogue between action sequences was also praised, especially LL Cool J's \"blend of [[Bible]] talk, smack and wit\".<ref name=\"Variety review\"/> Despite his few lines, Jane was seen as a charismatic character and \"a genuine new action star\".<ref name=\"Variety review\"/>\n\n===Home media===\n''Deep Blue Sea'' was first released on [[DVD]] on December 7, 1999, courtesy of [[Warner Home Video]].<ref name=\"DVD allmovie\"/> Special features include the film in a 2.35:1 [[anamorphic format]], two behind-the-scene [[featurettes]], five deleted scenes with extended dialogue and relationships between the characters, and an [[audio commentary]] in which Harlin and Jackson discuss the film's technical features and special effects.<ref name=\"DVD review\"/> Warner also released the film on [[Blu-ray]] on October 12, 2010,<ref name=\"DVD allmovie\"/> which includes the same special features from the DVD release.<ref name=\"Blu-ray review\"/>\n\n==Legacy==\nIn a 2016 retrospective, ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' editor Brian Raftery considered ''Deep Blue Sea'' \"the greatest non-''Jaws'' shark movie of all time\" and superior to [[Jaume Collet-Serra]]'s ''[[The Shallows (film)|The Shallows]]''.<ref name=\"DBS celebration\"/> He remarked that, within a genre that had been dominated by ''Jaws'', ''Deep Blue Sea'' features \"genuinely inventive\" action sequences, \"nicely rounded-out, human\" characters, and memorable death scenes.<ref name=\"DBS celebration\"/> Raftery also noted that the film was among the last of its kind, describing it as \"[A]n [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system|R-rated]] B-movie, full of [[Graphic violence|gore]] and chaos and smart-stupidness, but with a big-budget, big-cast sheen\", in a similar way to [[Paul Verhoeven]]'s ''[[Total Recall (1990 film)|Total Recall]]'' and ''[[Starship Troopers (film)|Starship Troopers]]'', [[Roland Emmerich]]'s ''[[Stargate (film)|Stargate]]'', and [[Luc Besson]]'s ''[[The Fifth Element]]''.<ref name=\"DBS celebration\"/> Samuel L. Jackson's surprising death scene in the film appears on some lists of best film deaths of all time.<ref name=\"DoG deaths\"/><ref name=\"Thevine deaths\"/>\n\n''Deep Blue Sea'' has often been cited as one of the greatest shark films of all time. In 2012, ''[[PopMatters]]'' ranked the film third, behind ''Jaws'' and ''[[Open Water (film)|Open Water]]'', and described it as \"[O]ne of the last great [films] from action ace Renny Harlin.\"<ref name=\"PopMatters ranking\"/> In 2015, ''Den of Geek!'', a publication of [[Dennis Publishing]], ranked ''Deep Blue Sea'' only behind ''Jaws'' and credited it for its action-packed scenes and intelligent sharks.<ref name=\"DoG ranking\"/> In 2017, ''[[Slant Magazine]]'' ranked it seventh and highlighted Jackson's death scene and LL Cool J's performance,<ref name=\"Slant ranking\"/> while ''[[Complex (magazine)|Complex]]'' ranked it third, praising its talented actors and tight action sequences.<ref name=\"Complex ranking\"/> In 2019, to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the release of ''Deep Blue Sea'', the [[Screamfest Horror Film Festival]] hosted a screening at the TCL Chinese theaters in Hollywood, California, as part of its \"Fears & Beers\" program. Cast members including actor Thomas Jane attended for a post-screening Q&A moderated by Brian Collins of [[Birth.Movies.Death.]]<ref name=\"20th anniversary\"/>\n\n== Sequels ==\nA [[direct-to-video]] sequel, ''[[Deep Blue Sea 2]]'', was released in 2018.<ref name=\"MPN sequel\"/> A third film, ''[[Deep Blue Sea 3]]'', was released on July 28, 2020.<ref name=\"DBS3\"/>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n\n<!--CITE AV MEDIA-->\n\n<ref name=\"DVD commentary\">{{cite AV media |people=Renny Harlin, Samuel L.
