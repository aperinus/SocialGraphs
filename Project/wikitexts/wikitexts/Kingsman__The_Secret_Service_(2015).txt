Blaming himself for Lee's death, Harry returns to [[London]] and gives Lee's young son Gary \"Eggsy\" a medal engraved with an emergency assistance number.\n\nSeventeen years later, Eggsy is a rebellious young person, having dropped out of training for the [[Royal Marines]] despite his intelligence and talent for [[gymnastics]] and [[parkour]].<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2015/02/kingsman-the-secret-service-review|title=Kingsman: The Secret Service Review |author=Richard Lawson|magazine=Vanity Fair|date=12 February 2015 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://m.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/entertainment/film-tv/reviews/kingsman-the-secret-service-review-spy-spoof-has-a-licence-to-thrill-30948603.html|title=Kingsman \u2013 The Secret Service review: Spy spoof has a licence to thrill|work=BelfastTelegraph.co.uk}}</ref> Arrested for stealing a car, Eggsy calls the emergency number, leading Harry to arrange his release and subdue Eggsy's abusive stepfather and his gang. Harry explains that he is a member of Kingsman, a private intelligence service founded by the British elite who lost their heirs in [[World War I]] and put their money toward protecting the world; the organisation is named for the tailor shop in [[Savile Row]] used as a front for their operations.\n\nHarry, codename \"Galahad\", nominates Eggsy to replace agent \"Lancelot\", who was killed by the assassin Gazelle while trying to rescue radical [[climate change]] scientist Professor James Arnold from kidnappers. Kingsman's technical support operative \"Merlin\" discovers Arnold working as though nothing has happened. Hart attempts to interrogate the professor at [[Imperial College London]], but a microchip in Arnold's neck explodes, killing him. The detonation signal is traced to Gazelle's employer Richmond Valentine, a billionaire philanthropist who has offered everyone in the world [[Subscriber identity module|SIM cards]] with free cellular and [[Internet access]]. Hart poses as another philanthropist to meet Valentine.\n\nEggsy befriends fellow Kingsman trainee Roxy, and he endures Merlin's tests until they are the only candidates left. Eggsy refuses his final test \u2014 shooting a [[Pug]] puppy he was given to raise \u2014 and Roxy is named the new \"Lancelot\". Harry learns of Valentine's connection to a religious [[hate group]] and travels to their church in [[Kentucky]], wearing glasses containing a video [[transceiver]]. As Eggsy watches Harry's footage, Valentine triggers the SIM cards inside the church with a signal that causes the parishioners and Harry to become murderously violent. Harry is the only survivor but is shot in the face by Valentine, [[Kingsman: The Golden Circle|apparently killing him.]]\n\nEggsy returns to Kingsman headquarters and notices Chester \"Arthur\" King, Kingsman's leader, has the same implantation scar on his neck as Professor Arnold. King reveals Valentine's plan to transmit his violence-inducing signal worldwide, \"culling\" most of humanity to avert its extinction from [[global warming]]. Valentine has recruited various world leaders and wealthy elite to his cause, implanted with chips to protect them from the signal; those who refuse are held captive at his bunker, including [[Crown Princess]] Tilde of Sweden. King poisons Eggsy's drink, but Eggsy switches glasses, letting King poison himself instead.\n\nEggsy, Merlin, and Roxy locate Valentine's bunker, where many of his conspirators are gathered. Roxy pilots [[high-altitude balloons]] to break up Valentine's [[satellite network]], but he secures a replacement. Merlin flies to the bunker, where Eggsy masquerades as King but is discovered by failed Kingsman recruit Charlie Hesketh. Cornered by Valentine's men, Merlin activates the implanted chips' failsafe, killing the guards and conspirators as heads explode around the world. Valentine activates the signal, triggering worldwide pandemonium. Eggsy kills Gazelle and impales Valentine with one of Gazelle's sharpened [[Flex-Foot Cheetah|prosthetic blades]], stopping the signal, and shares a sexual encounter with Princess Tilde.\n\nIn a mid-credits scene, Eggsy, now the new \"Galahad\", offers his mother and half-sister a new home and prepares to take on his stepfather and gang, just as Harry did.\n\n==Cast==\n{{main|List of Kingsman characters}}\n{{Cast listing|\n<!--This is how the film itself bills them in the credits billing.
