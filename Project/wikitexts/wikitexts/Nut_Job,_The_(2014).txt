A group of urban animals led by Raccoon and his cardinal assistant are running low on food for winter. Compassionate squirrel, Andie, and glory hogging squirrel, Grayson, compete with Surly and Buddy to scavenge from a nut cart run by Lucky and Fingers who are casing a bank. The squirrels' efforts inadvertently end with the cart's propane tank exploding in the park after its cord was bitten by Fingers' pug Precious. The runaway cart ends up destroying the animals' food supply, resulting in Surly's banishment from the park.\n\nIn the city, Surly and Buddy find Maury's Nut Shop. Adjacent to the bank, it is a criminal hideout used by Lucky, Fingers, their boss who was recently released from jail Percy \"King\" Dimpleweed, and Knuckles, who plan to break through the wall and replace the bank's cash with nuts. King's girlfriend Lana believes that King has gone straight after his release from prison and the nut store is legitimate.\n\nRaccoon sends Andie and Grayson to the city to find food, but they get separated when a street rat approaches them. Andie recovers Fingers' dog whistle, which Knuckles threw out and Surly had used against Precious, and threatens to dispose of it if Surly does not share the nuts he is going to take. Surly accepts and unwittingly befriends Precious after threatening her with the whistle. Andie informs the park community of the plan. Raccoon reluctantly goes with the plan (though planning to deny Surly his share) and assigns Mole and the Bruisers to go with her. Surly confronts, interrogates, and eventually learns from Mole that Raccoon's policy is to control the food supply in order to remain as the park community's leader, and is planning on sabotaging the heist to do so. When Andie does not believe him, Surly storms off after Grayson reunites with them. While collecting the nuts, Surly is captured by King, but he gets freed by Lana since he doesn't have the whistle anymore and she finds out that King hasn't changed his criminal ways. She then leaves King.\n\nAfter fending off street rats who work for Raccoon, Surly and Grayson chase the criminal gang's getaway truck, which carries Raccoon and the others. Surly fights off Cardinal and tosses him straight into a fancy cat show, and Mole defects from Raccoon and reveals the truth to the animals, resulting in Raccoon being voted out of the park community. King and Knuckles use the dynamite inside the empty truck to blow up a police barricade at a dam, but the police shoots the tire on the truck that falls from the dam. It explodes after Surly gets himself and Andie off it, causing the dam to collapse, a flash flood to happen, and everyone falling into the river below. Surly makes it to a log, but finds out that Raccoon, King, and Knuckles survived the explosion. Raccoon tries to kill Surly, but the nuts' & water's weight begins to break the log & push it over a waterfall. The animals arrive to rescue Surly, but Surly, deciding to be selfless in order to protect his friends, lets himself fall into the waterfall with Raccoon. Now seeing the good side of Surly, the park community mourns him as they go home on the river.\n\nThe nuts & the flood make their way to Liberty Park where King and his associates are arrested as Lana breaks up with King. Andie and Buddy are still mourning over Surly, and when Precious learns what happened, she has Buddy come look at an unconscious Surly, who wakes up and hugs Buddy. Afterward, Precious leaves to meet Lana, who plans to run Maury's Nut Shop. Finding Surly alive, Andie embraces him and suggests to tell the other animals of his heroism. However, Surly declines, yet gains a willingness to work with others, and goes into the city with Buddy, allowing Grayson to take credit for the nuts making it to the park.\n\nIn a [[mid-credits scene]], Raccoon and Cardinal are revealed to still be alive and are plotting revenge, while stuck on a buoy in the ocean, surrounded by hungry sharks circling them.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Will Arnett]] as [[Surly Squirrel|Surly]], a purple squirrel and the main protagonist.<ref name=THRReview />\n* [[Brendan Fraser]] as Grayson, a glory-hogging [[eastern gray squirrel]] who has a false reputation for being the \"park hero\".<ref name=THRReview />\n* [[Gabriel Iglesias]] as Jimmy, a [[groundhog]] and the leader of the Bruisers.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Roberts|first1=Sheila|title=Will Arnett and Katherine Heigl Talk THE NUT JOB, Creating the Voices for Their Characters, Collaborating with the Director and Animators, and More|url=https://collider.com/will-arnett-katherine-heigl-the-nut-job-interview/|publisher=Collider.com|access-date=August 27, 2014|date=January 19, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=McNary|first=Dave|author-link=Dave McNary|title=Gabriel Iglesias' 'Fluffy' Comedy Concert Film Set for Release|url=https://variety.com/2014/film/news/gabriel-iglesias-fluffy-comedy-concert-film-set-for-release-1201102432/|access-date=August 27, 2014|work=Variety|quote=Open Road and Gulfstream worked with Iglesias on animated film \"The Nut Job\", with Iglesias voicing Jimmy, a groundhog.|date=February 13, 2014}}</ref>\n* [[Jeff Dunham]] as Mole, a clumsy [[Mole (animal)|mole]] who works for Raccoon and has eyes that are sensitive to light.\n* [[Liam Neeson]] as Norvirus Raccoon, an evil [[raccoon]] and the self-proclaimed, power-hungry, deceitful con-artist and leader of the park who banishes Surly from the same park.
