Robinson accepts, but is warned by Rickey that he must control his temper despite the adversities he will face while breaking the [[baseball color line|color line]]. Robinson proposes to his girlfriend, [[Rachel Robinson|Rachel]], and she accepts.\n\nRobinson earns a spot with the [[Montreal Royals]], the [[Triple-A (baseball)|AAA]] affiliate of the Brooklyn [[Farm team|farm system]]. After performing well his first season, he advances to the Dodgers and is trained as a [[first baseman]]. Some of the Dodgers draft a petition refusing to play with Robinson, but manager [[Leo Durocher]] rebuffs them. However, Durocher is suspended by [[Commissioner of Baseball|Baseball Commissioner]] [[Happy Chandler]] due to his [[extramarital affair]]. [[Burt Shotton]] takes over as manager. Robinson and Rachel have their first child.\n\nIn a game against the [[Philadelphia Phillies]], manager [[Ben Chapman (baseball)|Ben Chapman]] taunts Robinson with racial epithets. With encouragement from Rickey, Robinson scores the winning [[run (baseball)|run]]. When Chapman's behavior toward Robinson generates negative press for the team, Phillies' [[general manager (baseball)|general manager]] [[Herb Pennock]] requires him to pose with Robinson for ''[[Life magazine|Life]]'' magazine.\n\nLater, [[Pee Wee Reese]] comes to understand what kind of pressure Robinson is facing, and makes a public show of solidarity, standing with his arm around Robinson's shoulders before a hostile crowd at [[Crosley Field]] in [[Cincinnati]], silencing them.\n\nIn a game against the [[St. Louis Cardinals]], [[Enos Slaughter]] spikes Robinson on the back of the leg with his [[Cleat (shoe)|cleats]]. The Dodgers want revenge, but Robinson calms them and insists they focus on winning the game.\n\nRobinson's [[home run]] against [[Pittsburgh Pirates]] [[pitcher (baseball)|pitcher]] [[Fritz Ostermueller]], who had earlier hit him in the head, helps clinch the [[National League pennant]] for the Dodgers, sending them to the [[1947 World Series|World Series]].\n\nA series of texts is shown in the epilogue of the film regarding Robinson and his teammates\u2019 future involvements, as well as others.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Chadwick Boseman]] as [[Jackie Robinson]]\n* [[Harrison Ford]] as [[Branch Rickey]]\n* [[Andr\u00e9 Holland]] as [[Wendell Smith (sportswriter)|Wendell Smith]]\n* [[Christopher Meloni]] as [[Leo Durocher]]\n* [[John C.
