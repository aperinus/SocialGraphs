A [[Co-production (media)|co-production]] of Ireland and the United Kingdom, it stars [[Daniel Day-Lewis]] as Brown, an Irish man born with [[cerebral palsy]], who could control only his left foot. Brown grew up in a poor working-class family, and became a writer and artist.<ref>''[[The Irish Filmography]] 1896-1996''; Red Mountain Press; 1996. page 43</ref> [[Brenda Fricker]], [[Ray McAnally]], [[Hugh O'Conor]], [[Fiona Shaw]], and [[Cyril Cusack]] are featured in supporting roles.\n\nThe film was theatrically released on 24 February 1989 to critical and commercial success. Reviewers praised the film's screenplay and direction, its message, and especially the performances of Day-Lewis and Fricker, while the film grossed $14.7 million on a \u00a3600,000 budget. At the [[62nd Academy Awards]], the film received five nominations, including for the [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], with Day-Lewis and Fricker winning [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] and [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]], respectively. In 2018, the [[British Film Institute]] ranked it as the [[BFI Top 100 British films|53rd greatest British film of the 20th century]].<ref>[https://www.cinemarealm.com/best-of-cinema/top-100-british-films/ ''British Film Institute \u2013 Top 100 British Films''] {{Webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180112022753/https://www.cinemarealm.com/best-of-cinema/top-100-british-films/ |date=12 January 2018}} (1999). Retrieved August 27, 2016</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1932, [[Christy Brown]] is born into a family of 15. Doctors discover he has severe [[cerebral palsy]]. Christy is unable to walk or talk. He is loved and supported by his family, especially his mother. One day, Christy's mother trips down the stairs while in [[Childbirth|labour]] and Christy was the only person home to see it. He was able to alert some neighbours and summon them over to help. Christy's father, who never believed Christy would amount to anything, starts to become proud after witnessing him use his left foot, the only body part he can fully control, to write the word \"mother\" on the floor with a piece of chalk.\n\nConsequently, Christy seeks a hobby in painting. The neighbourhood youngsters include him in their activities, like street football, but when he paints a picture and gives it to a girl he likes, she returns it. Later, his father loses his job and the family faces exceptionally difficult hardships, so Christy devises a plan to help his brothers steal coal to their mother's dismay. Christy's mother, who had been gradually gathering some savings in a tin in the fireplace, finally saves enough to buy him a wheelchair.\n\nChristy is then introduced to Eileen Cole, who takes him to her school for cerebral palsy patients and persuades a friend of hers to hold an exhibition of his work. Christy falls in love with Cole, but when he learns during the dinner that she is engaged to be married, he considers suicide. His mother helps him build a private studio for himself, but soon afterward his father dies of a stroke, and during the wake Christy instigates a brawl. At this point, Christy starts writing his autobiography, \"My Left Foot\". Cole returns and they resume their friendship. Later on, Christy attends a charity event where he meets his handler, a nurse named Mary Carr. She begins reading his autobiography. He asks Mary to go out with him and they then happily leave the fete together.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n\n* [[Daniel Day-Lewis]] as [[Christy Brown]], a man born with [[cerebral palsy]]\n** [[Hugh O'Conor]] as Young Christy Brown\n* [[Brenda Fricker]] as Bridget Fagan Brown, Christy's mother\n* [[Ray McAnally]] as Patrick Brown, Christy's father\n* [[Fiona Shaw]] as Eileen Cole, Christy's carer\n* [[Kirsten Sheridan]] as Sharon Brown, Christy's sister\n* Alison Whelan as Sheila Brown, Christy's sister\n* Eanna MacLiam as Benny Brown, Christy's brother\n* Declan Croghan as Tom Brown, Christy's brother\n* [[Marie Conmee]]  as Sadie Brown, Christy's sister\n* [[Cyril Cusack]] as Lord Castlewelland\n* [[Phelim Drew]] as Brian\n* [[Eileen Colgan]] as Nan\n* Ruth McCabe as Mary Carr, Christy's handler and eventual wife\n* [[Adrian Dunbar]] as Peter, Cole's fianc\u00e9\n\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\nDay-Lewis became interested in the project when he read the opening scene, which features him, as Brown, using his left foot to place a [[Phonograph record|record]] on a player and then placing a needle onto it so that it will play.<ref name=\"Perfectionist\">{{cite web |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/3669814/Daniel-Day-Lewis-the-perfectionist.html |title=Daniel Day-Lewis: the perfectionist |last=Hirschberg |first=Lynn |author-link=Lynn Hirschberg |work=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]] |date=8 December 2007 |access-date=27 October 2015 |archive-date=21 February 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160221004343/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/3669814/Daniel-Day-Lewis-the-perfectionist.html |url-status=live}} {{registration required}}</ref> He said of the scene: \"I knew it couldn't be done... and that intrigued me.\"<ref name=\"Perfectionist\"/> Many scenes were filmed through a mirror, as Day-Lewis could only manipulate his right foot to perform the actions seen in the film.
