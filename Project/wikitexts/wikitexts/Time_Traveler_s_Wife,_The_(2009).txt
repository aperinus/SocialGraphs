Moments later, Henry is helped by an older version of himself who has also traveled back. Unable to control the timing or destinations of his traveling, Henry finds himself drawn to significant people, places, and events in his life but is incapable of changing events beyond the minor differences his presence creates.\n\nIn 1991, Henry meets Clare Abshire in the library where he works. She is overjoyed to see him although he is meeting her for the first time. Clare explains that she met Henry's future self when she was a child, and that he informed her then that they would meet in the future, which is happening now.  As a child, Clare develops a crush on Henry, and she is upset to learn that he is married. When Clare turns 18, two years before their meeting at the library, the older Henry kisses her, leading her to realize that he is her husband in the future. They begin a relationship, which is challenged by Henry's disorder.\n\nHis sporadic time traveling is further complicated by the fact that he arrives at his destinations completely naked. From an early age, he had learned how to pick locks and to steal clothing to endure his travels. Among his getaways are many visits to young Clare. From present-day Clare's diary, he gets a list of dates when he visited her and gives those to young Clare so that she can be waiting for him with clothes. Clare eventually marries Henry. Henry time travels away before the ceremony and a visibly older version of himself arrives in time to step in.\n\nHenry's disappearances take a toll on his relationship with Clare. To make up for this, Henry buys a winning lottery ticket due to having the numbers in advance, but their relationship still has problems. Henry and Clare witness a middle-aged wounded Henry briefly arrive from another time, leaving them concerned about how long Henry must live. His disorder also makes having a child with Clare seemingly impossible, as Henry's genes cause their unborn fetuses to time travel. They seek a renowned doctor's help, but after numerous similar miscarriages, Henry has a secret [[vasectomy]] to end their suffering. However, soon after, Clare gets pregnant one last time\u2014by a visiting younger version of Henry\u2014and carries the baby to full term. Before the child is born, Henry travels forward in time and happily meets their pre-teen daughter, Alba. She tells him that she is a time traveler, too, but has increasing control over when and where she travels. Alba tells Henry that he will die when she is five years old, a fact that Henry subsequently hides from Clare.\n\nAlba's pre-teen self, who ultimately tries to prepare her younger self for Henry's death, visits young Alba sporadically. During Alba's fifth birthday party with family and friends Clare is devastated to discover Henry's impending death. Later, after suffering from severe frostbite from a time jump gone wrong and temporarily using a wheelchair, Henry time travels again and is accidentally shot by Clare's father, who is hunting elk.  Henry returns in time to die in Clare's arms. Some years later, a younger Henry visits Alba and Clare, giving Clare hope that he will visit again, though he tells her not to spend her life waiting for him, hoping this encounter would provide a proper closure for Clare and Alba.\n\n==Cast==\n<!--- Cast and order per tombstone closing credits, roles per closing credits scroll --->\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Rachel McAdams]] as Clare Abshire\n**[[Brooklynn Proulx]] as young Clare\n* [[Eric Bana]] as Henry DeTamble\n**[[Alex Ferris]] as young Henry\n* [[Arliss Howard]] as Richard DeTamble, Henry's father\n* [[Ron Livingston]] as Gomez, Henry and Clare's friend\n* [[Stephen Tobolowsky]] as Dr. Kendrick\n* [[Michelle Nolden]] as Annette DeTamble, Henry's mother\n* Jane McLean as Charisse, Clare's best friend\n* [[Hailey McCann]] as Alba\n** Tatum McCann as young Alba \n}}\n\nIn addition, [[Fiona Reid]], Philip Craig, Maggie Castle and Brian Bisson play Clare's parents and siblings, respectively.

A television commercial for the film featured the song \"Show Me What I'm Looking For\", by [[Carolina Liar]], although it was not included within the [[soundtrack]].
