It was directed by [[George Abbott]] and [[Stanley Donen]] from a screenplay by Abbott, adapted from his and [[Douglass Wallop]]'s book of the 1955 [[Damn Yankees|musical of the same name]], itself based on the 1954 novel ''[[The Year the Yankees Lost the Pennant]]'' by Wallop. The storyline is a take on the [[Faust]] legend<ref>{{cite book|editor1-last=Fitzsimmons|editor1-first=Lorna|title=Lives of Faust: The Faust Theme in Literature and Music. A Reader|date=2008|publisher=Walter De Gruyter|location=New York|page=12|isbn=9783110973976|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SH2FQy3_DP4C|access-date=11 July 2017}}</ref> and centers on the [[New York Yankees]] and [[Washington Senators (1901\u201360)|Washington Senators]] baseball teams. With the exception of [[Tab Hunter]] in the role of Joe Hardy (replacing [[Stephen Douglass]]), the Broadway principals reprise their stage roles, including [[Gwen Verdon]] as Lola.\n\nA notable difference between the film and stage versions was Gwen Verdon's performance of the song \"A Little Brains\". Verdon's suggestive hip movements (as choreographed by [[Bob Fosse]] and performed on stage) were considered too risqu\u00e9 for a mainstream 1958 American audience, and so she simply pauses at these points in the film. The title was changed in the United Kingdom to avoid use of the word \"Damn\" on film posters, hoardings, and cinema marquees.\n\n==Plot==\nJoe Boyd (Robert Shafer) is a middle-aged fan of the unsuccessful [[Washington Senators (1901\u201360)|Washington Senators]] baseball team. His obsession with baseball is driving a wedge between him and his wife, Meg\u2014a problem shared by many other wives of Senators supporters. Meg ([[Shannon Bolin]]) leads them in lamenting their husbands' fixation with the sport (\"Six Months Out of Every Year\").\n\nAfter seeing his team lose yet again, Joe rashly declares that he would sell his soul to the devil to see his team beat the Yankees.  No sooner has he spoken than the devil appears before him in the guise of a suave conman, Applegate ([[Ray Walston]]).  Applegate claims he can go one better\u2014he can restore Joe's youth, making him the player who wins them the pennant. Joe agrees, but persuades Applegate to give him an [[escape clause]].  Applegate declares that Joe can back out, but only the day before the last game of the season\u2014afterwards, his soul belongs to the devil.\n\nJoe bids an emotional farewell to a sleeping Meg (\"Goodbye Old Girl\"), after which Applegate transforms him into a dashing young man ([[Tab Hunter]]), now called Joe Hardy.\n\nThe next day, the Senators' practice is a fiasco. Their manager, Ben Van Buren ([[Russ Brown (actor)|Russ Brown]]), gives the team a rousing pep talk (\"Heart\"). Applegate arrives and, introducing himself as a scout, presents his new discovery\u2014Joe Hardy from Hannibal, Missouri. Joe promptly hits baseball after baseball out of the park in an impromptu batting practice. As he is signed to a Senators contract, female sportswriter Gloria Thorpe ([[Rae Allen]]) plans to quickly get Joe into the public eye (\"Shoeless Joe from Hannibal, Mo.\").\n\nWith tremendous home runs and game-saving catches, Joe leads the Senators on a long winning streak into pennant contention and becomes a national hero. Joe misses Meg dreadfully, however, and keeps sneaking back to his old neighborhood for a glimpse of her.  Realising this could ruin his plans, Applegate summons his demonic right-hand girl, Lola ([[Gwen Verdon]]), a seductress who was once known as the ugliest woman in her territory, but sold her soul to Applegate in exchange for eternal youth and beauty. She is ordered to make Joe forget his wife, a task Lola is confident she can carry out (\"A Little Brains, A Little Talent\").\n\nJoe succeeds in getting close to Meg by renting a room in his old house; Meg is unaware of his baseball stardom. Applegate and Lola corner Joe in the baseball team's locker room, where Lola confidently tries to seduce Joe (\"Whatever Lola Wants\"). But she has her first failure\u2014Joe dearly loves Meg, and does not fall for Lola's tempting ways. Applegate angrily banishes Lola.\n\nBy the end of the season, the Senators are on the verge of overtaking the Yankees, so the Washington fans hold a lavish tribute (\"Who's Got the Pain?\"). Gloria, having returned from Hannibal, Missouri, where no residents remember a Joe Hardy, confronts Applegate about the player's true identity. Applegate implies that Joe is actually Shifty McCoy, a corrupt minor leaguer playing under a pseudonym. By the end of the tribute, newspapers arrive accusing Joe of being Shifty. He must meet with the baseball commissioner for a hearing or else be thrown out of baseball\u2014on the day he plans to switch back to being Joe Boyd.\n\nAt the hearing, Meg and her female neighbors arrive as material witnesses, attesting to Joe's honesty and falsely claiming he grew up with them in Hannibal. The commissioner acquits Joe, but as everyone celebrates, midnight strikes and Joe realizes he is doomed.\n\nApplegate has planned for the Senators to lose the pennant on the last day of the season, resulting in thousands of heart attacks, nervous breakdowns and suicides of Yankee-haters across the country. He is reminded of his other evil misdeeds throughout history (\"Those Were the Good Old Days\").\n\nFollowing the hearing, Lola lets Joe know she's drugged Applegate so that he will sleep through the last game. They commiserate over their condemned situation at a nightclub (\"Two Lost Souls\").\n\nLate the next afternoon, Applegate awakens to find the Senators/Yankees game well underway. Realizing Lola has tricked him\u2014and worse, that Lola has actually fallen in love with Joe\u2014he turns her back into an ugly hag.\n\nThey arrive at the ballpark by the ninth [[inning]], the Senators up by a run. With two outs, one of the Yankee sluggers ([[Mickey Mantle]]) hits a long drive to the outfield. As he backs up to make the catch, Applegate impulsively switches Joe Hardy back into Joe Boyd in full view of the stadium. Now paunchy and middle-aged, Joe makes a final lunge at the ball and catches it. Washington wins the pennant! As his teammates celebrate and fans storm the field, an unrecognized Joe escapes from the ballpark.\n\nLate that night, as the public wonders why Joe Hardy has disappeared, Joe Boyd meekly returns to his house. A tearful Meg hugs him and they sing to each other (\"There's Something about an Empty Chair\"). Applegate materializes once again and offers Joe the chance to resume being Joe Hardy in time for the World Series; he also makes Lola young and beautiful again to tempt Joe.  Joe ignores him, and a tantrum-throwing Applegate vanishes for good.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Tab Hunter in Damn Yankees trailer.jpg|thumb|right|Hunter as Joe Hardy]]\n* [[Tab Hunter]] as Joe Hardy, a younger version of Joe Boyd\n* [[Gwen Verdon]] as Lola, Applegate's demonic servant\n* [[Ray Walston]] as [[Satan|Applegate]], the Devil in disguise \n* [[Russ Brown (actor)|Russ Brown]] as Benny Van Buren, the Washington Senators manager\n* [[Shannon Bolin]] as Mrs. Meg Boyd, Joe Boyd's wife\n* Robert Shafer as Mr. Joe Boyd, a fan of the [[Washington Senators (1901-1960)|Washington Senators]]\n* [[Rae Allen]] as Gloria Thorpe, reporter\n* Nathaniel Frey as Smokey, player\n* [[James Komack]] as Rocky, player\n* Albert Linville as Vernon, player\n* [[Jean Stapleton]] as Sister Miller, Meg's friend\n* Elizabeth Howell as Doris Miller, Meg's friend\n* [[Bob Fosse]] as Mambo Dancer (uncredited)\n* [[Harry Wilson (actor)|Harry Wilson]] as Spectator (uncredited) \nUncredited in archive footage are [[Yogi Berra]], [[Mickey Mantle]], [[Bill Skowron]], and other New York Yankees baseball players, plus [[Art Passarella]] ([[umpire (baseball)|umpire]])\n\n==Song list==\n<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0051516/soundtrack \"'Damn Yankees!'

While Bob Fosse is not credited for the Mambo number, Tab Hunter thanks him by name as they come off the stage.\n\n==Reception==\nReviews from critics were generally positive. [[Bosley Crowther]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote that Verdon's performance was \"one of the hottest and heartiest we've seen years ... Miss Verdon has the sort of fine, fresh talent that the screen badly needs these days. But lest she seem to be the whole show, let us hasten to proclaim that there's a great deal more to 'Damn Yankees' than this wonderful red-headed dame. Like the George Abbott stage show before it, it has class, imagination, verve and a good many of the same performers who did so charmingly by it on Broadway\".<ref>{{cite journal |last=Crowther |first=Bosley |date=September 27, 1958 |title=Screen: 'Damn Yankees' |journal=[[The New York Times]] |page=12 }}</ref>\n\n''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' wrote: \"That 10 of the top 11 players, plus creators from writer to costume designer, have been transferred en masse from Broadway just about insures a film that is as least as good as its stage counterpart.
