The film is based on [[E. L. James]]' [[Fifty Shades of Grey|2011 novel of the same name]] and stars [[Dakota Johnson]] as Anastasia Steele, a college graduate who begins a [[sadomasochism|sadomasochistic]] relationship with young business magnate Christian Grey, played by [[Jamie Dornan]].\n\n''Fifty Shades of Grey'' premiered at the [[69th Berlin International Film Festival]] on February 11, 2015, and was released on February 13, 2015, in [[IMAX]] formats, by [[Universal Pictures]] and [[Focus Features]]. Despite receiving generally negative reviews, it was an immediate [[box office]] success, breaking numerous box office records and earning over US$570 million worldwide, while its [[Fifty Shades of Grey (soundtrack)|soundtrack album]] was also successful.\n\nThe film was the most awarded at the [[36th Golden Raspberry Awards]], winning five of six nominations, including [[Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Picture|Worst Picture]] (tied with ''[[Fantastic Four (2015 film)|Fantastic Four]]'') and both leading roles. [[Ellie Goulding]]'s single \"[[Love Me Like You Do]]\" was nominated for the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song]], while [[The Weeknd]]'s single \"[[Earned It]]\" was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Original Song]] at the [[88th Academy Awards]].\n\nIt is the first installment in the [[Fifty Shades (film series)|''Fifty Shades'' film series]] and was followed by two sequels, ''[[Fifty Shades Darker (film)|Fifty Shades Darker]]'' and ''[[Fifty Shades Freed (film)|Fifty Shades Freed]]'', released in 2017 and 2018, respectively, both of which were received negatively but were commercially successful.\n\n==Plot==\n21-year-old Anastasia \"Ana\" Steele is an English literature major at [[Washington State University]]'s satellite campus near [[Vancouver, Washington|Vancouver]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]]. When her roommate, Kate Kavanagh, becomes ill and is unable to interview Christian Grey, a 27-year-old billionaire entrepreneur, for the college newspaper, Ana agrees to take her place. At Christian's Seattle headquarters she stumbles her way through the meeting. Christian, who is that year's WSU [[Graduation|commencement]] speaker, takes an interest in her; soon after, he visits the [[Hardware store|hardware]] store where Ana works, and offers to do a photo shoot to accompany the article she had interviewed him for.\n\nChristian invites Ana for coffee, but leaves abruptly after she confesses to being a romantic, saying he is not the man for her. He later sends her first edition copies of two [[Thomas Hardy]] novels, including ''[[Tess of the d'Urbervilles]]'', as a gift, with a quote from the latter book about the dangers of relationships, on an accompanying card.\n\nAna and her friends celebrate graduation at a local bar. After drinking too much, she spontaneously calls Christian, saying she is returning the books, and berating his behavior towards her. He goes to the bar to find her, arriving just as her photographer friend, Jos\u00e9 Rodriquez, attempts to kiss her against her will. Ana is suddenly sick. The next morning, she wakes up in Christian's hotel room, relieved that they were not intimate.\n\nAna and Christian begin seeing each other, though he insists that she sign a [[non-disclosure agreement]] preventing her from revealing details about their dalliance. He explains that he engages in sexual [[Bondage (BDSM)|bondage]]  relationships, but only as clearly defined in a contract between the participants. Ana reveals that she is a [[virgin]]. While considering the agreement and negotiating her own terms, and after visiting his \"playroom\", a room stocked with a variety of [[BDSM]] toys, furniture and gear, she and Christian have conventional sex (Ana loses her [[virginity]]). The next morning, before being taken home, she meets Christian's adoptive mother, Grace, who unexpectedly arrives.\n\nChristian bestows a series of gifts and favors upon Ana, including a new car and a laptop. After she and Kate move to Seattle, she continues seeing him. During dinner at his parents' home, Ana suddenly mentions she is leaving the next day to visit her mother in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. Later, Christian becomes frustrated when she says she wants more than the one-sided relationship he proposes. She is shocked when Christian shows up in Georgia; he takes her air gliding, then returns to Seattle to tend to a business emergency.\n\nAfter returning home, Ana continues seeing Christian, who wants further sexual experimentation. She initially consents, but he remains emotionally distant, upsetting her. While still considering the contract, and in an effort to understand Christian's psychology, Ana asks him to demonstrate how he would \"punish\" her for rule-breaking. He whips her buttocks with a belt, making her count each strike out loud. Upset and disgusted, Ana leaves Christian, concluding he is wrong for her and his practices are deviant and excessive. \n\n==Cast==\n{{Multiple image\n  | direction = vertical\n  | footer = [[Jamie Dornan]] and [[Dakota Johnson]].\n  | image1 = Jamie Dornan January 2013.jpg\n  | width1 = 132\n  | image2 = Dakota Johnson 2014 (cropped).jpg\n  | width2 = 132\n}}\n* [[Dakota Johnson]] as Anastasia \"Ana\" Steele, a 21-year-old English Literature student attending [[Washington State University]].\n* [[Jamie Dornan]] as Christian Grey, a 27-year-old billionaire, entrepreneur, and CEO of Grey Enterprises Holdings Inc.\n* [[Eloise Mumford]] as Katherine \"Kate\" Kavanagh,<ref name=\"mumford\">{{cite news|url=https://variety.com/2013/film/news/eloise-mumford-fifty-shades-of-grey-1200865898/ |title='Fifty Shades': Eloise Mumford Tapped to Play Anastasia Steele's Roommate |date=November 22, 2013 |access-date=December 4, 2013 |first=Justin |last=Kroll |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]}}</ref> Anastasia's best friend/roommate who begins a relationship with Christian's older brother, Elliot Grey.\n* [[Jennifer Ehle]] as Carla Wilks,<ref name=\"elhe\">{{cite web|last=Fleming|first=Mike Jr.|title=Jennifer Ehle Joining 'Fifty Shades Of Grey' As Anastasia Steele's Mother|url=https://www.deadline.com/2013/10/jennifer-ehle-joining-fifty-shades-of-grey-as-anastasia-steeles-mother/|website=[[Deadline Hollywood]] |access-date=October 8, 2013 |date=October 7, 2013}}</ref> Anastasia's mother.\n* [[Marcia Gay Harden]] as Dr. Grace Trevelyan-Grey,<ref name=\"harden\">{{cite web|last=Kit|first=Borys|title='Fifty Shades of Grey' Adds Marcia Gay Harden as Christian Grey's Mother |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/fifty-shades-grey-adds-marcia-661732 |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |access-date=December 4, 2013 |date=December 3, 2013}}</ref> Christian Grey's adoptive mother.\n* [[Victor Rasuk]] as Jose Rodriguez,<ref name=\"rasuk\">{{cite news|first=Jeff|last=Sneider|title='Fifty Shades of Grey' Casts 'How to Make It in America' Star Victor Rasuk as Jose|url=https://www.thewrap.com/fifty-shades-grey-casts-make-america-star-victor-rasuk-jose/|work=[[TheWrap]]|date=October 31, 2013 |access-date=November 1, 2013}}</ref> one of Anastasia's close friends.\n* [[Luke Grimes]] as Elliot Grey,<ref>{{cite web|last=Kit|first=Borys|title='True Blood' Actor Joins 'Fifty Shades of Grey' |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/fifty-shades-grey-luke-grimes-650995|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|access-date=December 4, 2013|date=October 25, 2013}}</ref> Christian's adopted older brother.\n* [[Rita Ora]] as Mia Grey,<ref>{{cite tweet|author=Rita Ora|author-link=Rita Ora|user=RitaOra|title=It's official!
