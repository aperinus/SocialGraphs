As the [[Imperial German Army]] retreats, they [[booby trap]] the whole town to explode. The locals flee and, left to their own devices, a gaggle of cheerful [[lunatic]]s escape the [[mental hospital|asylum]] and take over the town &mdash; thoroughly confusing the lone Scottish soldier who has been dispatched to defuse the bomb.\n\n==Plot==\n[[Signaller]] Charles Plumpick (Bates) is a [[kilt]]-wearing French-born Scottish soldier caring for [[war pigeon]]s, who is sent by his commanding officer to disarm a bomb placed in the town square by the retreating Germans.\n\nAfter the townspeople learn about the booby trap, its inhabitants\u2014including those who run the insane asylum\u2014abandon it.  The asylum gates are left open, and the inmates leave the asylum and take on the roles of the townspeople. Plumpick has no reason to think they are not who they appear to be\u2014other than the colorful and playful way in which they're living their lives, so at odds with the fearful and war-ravaged times.  The lunatics crown Plumpick the King of Hearts with surreal pageantry as he frantically tries to find the bomb before it goes off.\n\n==Theatrical releases==\nWhen it was released in France in 1966, ''King of Hearts'' was not especially successful critically or at the box office, with only 141,035 admissions.<ref>[http://www.jpbox-office.com/fichfilm.php?id=9188&affich=france J.P.'s Box Office]</ref>\n\nHowever, it achieved bona fide [[cult film|cult-film]] status, when United States distribution rights were picked up by Randy Finley and Specialty Films in Seattle in 1973. It was paired with [[Marv Newland]]'s ''[[Bambi Meets Godzilla]]'' and John Magnuson's ''[[Thank You Mask Man]]'' and marketed under the heading ''The King of Hearts and His Loyal Short Subjects''.<ref>[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1499&dat=19750127&id=t9wjAAAAIBAJ&sjid=DCkEAAAAIBAJ&pg=3554,3460779&hl=en (Jan 27, 1975) ''The Milwaukee Journal''] retrieved May 4, 2015</ref><ref>[http://www.historylink.org/index.cfm?DisplayPage=output.cfm&file_id=7275 \"Randy Finley\"] historylink.org, retrieved May 4, 2015</ref>  During the mid 1970s, it was presented in repertory movie theaters as well as non-theatrical college and university film series across the United States, eventually running for five years at the now defunct film house, the Central Square Cinemas<ref>{{cite web|last1=DeLuca|first1=Gerald A.|title=Central Square Cinemas|url=http://cinematreasures.org/theaters/6561|website=Cinema Treasures|publisher=Cinema Treasures, LLC|access-date=16 June 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160520081642/http://cinematreasures.org/theaters/6561|archive-date=2016-05-20|quote=The most famous bit of programming here was Philippe de Broca\u2019s 1966 \"King of Hearts\", which ran for four years or so and spawned a huge cult following that gave the film new life across the United States.
