It was directed by [[Lee Unkrich]], the editor of the first two films and the co-director of ''Toy Story 2'', produced by [[Darla K. Anderson]], and written by [[Michael Arndt]], while Unkrich wrote the story along with [[John Lasseter]] and [[Andrew Stanton]], respectively, director and co-writer of the first two films. In ''Toy Story 3'', Andy Davis, now 17 years old, is going to college. [[Sheriff Woody|Woody]], [[Buzz Lightyear]], and [[List of Toy Story characters#Andy's toys|the other toys]] are accidentally donated to Sunnyside Daycare, a daycare center by Andy's mother, and the toys must decide where their loyalties lie.

[[Jim Varney]], who voiced Slinky Dog in the first two films, died on February 10, 2000, 10 years before the release of the third film, so the role of Slinky was passed down to [[Blake Clark]]. The returning cast is joined by [[Ned Beatty]], [[Michael Keaton]], [[Whoopi Goldberg]], [[Timothy Dalton]], [[Kristen Schaal]], [[Bonnie Hunt]], and [[Jeff Garlin]] who voice the new characters introduced in this film.\n\nIn 2004, following disagreements between Disney CEO [[Michael Eisner]] and Pixar CEO [[Steve Jobs]], Disney plans to make ''Toy Story 3'' at the new studio [[Circle 7 Animation]] unit, with the tentative theatrical release date in early 2008. The script was developed multiple versions; however, after Disney brought Pixar in early 2006, the Circle 7's version of the film was cancelled as the result of Circle Seven Animation's closure. The production was transferred to Pixar to make a new storyline. [[Randy Newman]] returned to composed the film's musical score. The film premiered at [[Taormina Film Fest]] in Italy and was released in the United States on June 18, 2010. ''Toy Story 3'' was the first film to be released theatrically with [[Dolby Surround 7.1]] sound.<ref name=\"market watch\">{{cite news |url=http://www.marketwatch.com/story/dolby-unveils-dolby-surround-71-at-showest-2010-2010-03-16?reflink=MW_news_stmp |title=Dolby Unveils Dolby Surround 7.1 at ShoWest 2010 |access-date=March 16, 2010|publisher=[[MarketWatch]]}}</ref> Like its predecessors, ''Toy Story 3'' received critical acclaim upon release, with critics praising the vocal performances, screenplay, emotional depth, animation, and Newman's musical score.<ref name=\"rt\"/><ref name=\"mc\"/>\n\nIt became the second Pixar film (after ''[[Up (2009 film)|Up]]'') and third animated film overall (after ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]'' and ''Up''), as well as the third film produced by Walt Disney Pictures to receive an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]].

He has not played with his toys for years, and only [[Sheriff Woody|Woody]], [[Buzz Lightyear]], [[Jessie (Toy Story)|Jessie]], [[Bullseye (Toy Story)|Bullseye]], [[Rex (Toy Story)|Rex]], [[Slinky Dog (character)|Slinky]], [[Hamm (Toy Story)|Hamm]], [[Mr. Potato Head (Toy Story)|Mr.]] and [[Mrs. Potato Head (Toy Story)|Mrs. Potato Head]], the [[Squeeze Toy Aliens|Aliens]], and three [[Sarge and the Bucket O Soldiers|toy soldiers]] remain. As the despondent toys reflect on their future, the soldiers parachute out the window and leave. Andy intends to take Woody to college, and puts the other toys into a trash bag, to be placed in the attic; however, Andy's mother mistakenly puts the bag outside with the true garbage. The toys narrowly escape from the [[garbage truck]], and, believing Andy deliberately threw them away, get into a donation box in Andy's mother's car with [[Molly Davis|Molly]]'s old [[Barbie (Toy Story)|Barbie]] doll. Woody follows in an attempt to bring them back, but is unable to convince the others of Andy's real intentions, and goes along when Andy's mother takes the box of donations to Sunnyside Daycare.\n\nAt Sunnyside, Andy's toys are welcomed by the other toys, led by [[Lots-O'-Huggin' Bear]] (\"Lotso\"). The toys (except for Woody) are delighted to learn that Sunnyside never runs out of children, and Barbie is enamored with a [[Ken (Toy Story)|Ken]] doll. Woody attempts to return home, but is instead found by a child from Sunnyside named [[List of Toy Story characters#Bonnie|Bonnie]], who brings him home and plays with him and her other toys. Bonnie's toys are shocked that Woody escaped from Sunnyside. [[Chuckles (Toy Story)|Chuckles]], a toy clown, explains that he, Lotso, and [[Big Baby (Toy Story)|Big Baby]] were owned by a girl named Daisy, but were lost during a family trip. When they made it home, Lotso found out that he had been replaced. Disregarding Chuckles' protests, the embittered Lotso lied to Big Baby that Daisy had replaced all of them. They rode a truck to Sunnyside, where Lotso took over, turning it into a toy prison. Chuckles was eventually broken and later found by Bonnie.\n\nAfter the Sunnyside toddlers play roughly with Andy's toys, Buzz asks Lotso to move the toys to the older children's room. Lotso allows Buzz to go, but when he insists that Andy's toys go as well, Lotso switches Buzz to his original Demo mode factory settings, causing him to believe he's a real space ranger under Lotso's command. Meanwhile, Mrs. Potato Head, through an eye she lost in Andy's room, sees Andy searching for his toys. They realize that Woody told the truth about Andy's intentions and try to escape, but Lotso's henchmen, now assisted by the brainwashed Buzz, imprison them.\n\nWoody returns to Sunnyside, where a [[Chatter Telephone]] tells him the trash is now the only way out. Later that night, the toys make their escape plan. After successfully stealing the master key and disabling Lotso's night watchman, they attempt to restore Buzz, but Rex accidentally resets Buzz to Spanish mode. Spanish Buzz immediately allies himself with Woody and falls in love with Jessie. The toys reach a dumpster, but are cornered by Lotso's gang. Woody reveals Lotso's deception to Big Baby, who angrily throws Lotso into the dumpster. As a garbage truck approaches, the toys try to leave, but Lotso pulls Woody into the dumpster. The rest of Andy's toys jump after him as the truck arrives and fall inside.\n\nBuzz returns to normal after a television falls onto him inside the truck. The truck takes the toys to a landfill, where they are swept onto a conveyor belt that leads to an [[Incineration|incinerator]]. The Aliens spot an industrial claw, but are swept away while running toward it. After narrowly avoiding a [[industrial shredder|shredder]] while trying to rescue Lotso, Woody and Buzz help Lotso reach an emergency stop button, only for Lotso to abandon them. The toys fall into the incinerator and resign themselves to their apparent fate, but the Aliens, having reached the industrial claw, rescue them. Lotso is later found by a garbage truck driver, who fastens him to his truck's radiator [[Grille (car)|grille]] along with a few other toys. Woody and his friends ride another garbage truck back to Andy's house.\n\nWoody leaves a note for Andy, who, thinking the note is from his mother, donates the toys to Bonnie. Andy introduces the toys individually to Bonnie and is surprised to find Woody at the bottom of the donation box. Bonnie recognizes him, and though initially hesitant, Andy passes Woody on to her, and they play together before he leaves. Woody and the other toys witness Andy's departure as they begin their new lives with Bonnie.\n\nIn the film's epilogue, Barbie, Ken, and Big Baby have vastly improved Sunnyside and maintain contact with Bonnie's toys through letters. The toy soldiers parachute into Sunnyside, where Ken and Barbie welcome them.\n\n== Voice cast ==\n{{Main|List of Toy Story characters}}\nCredits adapted from the [[British Film Institute]].<ref name=BFI>{{cite web |title=Toy Story 3 |url=http://explore.bfi.org.uk/4ce2b8c55858e |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120804073325/http://explore.bfi.org.uk/4ce2b8c55858e |url-status=dead |archive-date=August 4, 2012 |work=British Film Institute |access-date=February 16, 2014}}</ref>\n[[File:Kristen Schaal, Jeff Garlin, Toy Story 3, WonderCon 2010.jpg|thumb|Kristen Schaal and Jeff Garlin, who attended the ''Toy Story 3'' panel at the 2010 [[WonderCon]], joined the cast as Trixie and Buttercup, respectively.<ref>{{cite web |last=Goldman |first=Eric |title=WC 10: Toy Story 3 Scenes Shown |url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2010/04/03/wc-10-toy-story-3-scenes-shown |work=IGN |access-date=February 16, 2014 |date=April 3, 2010}}</ref>]]\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Tom Hanks]] as [[Sheriff Woody|Woody]]\n* [[Tim Allen]] as [[Buzz Lightyear]]\n* [[Joan Cusack]] as [[Jessie (Toy Story)|Jessie]]\n* [[Ned Beatty]] as [[Lots-O'-Huggin' Bear|Lotso]]\n* [[John Morris (actor)|John Morris]] as [[Andy Davis (Toy Story)|Andy]]\n* [[Don Rickles]] as [[Mr. Potato Head (Toy Story)|Mr. Potato Head]]\n* [[Blake Clark]] as [[Slinky Dog (character)|Slinky Dog]]\n* [[Wallace Shawn]] as [[Rex (Toy Story)|Rex]]\n* [[John Ratzenberger]] as [[Hamm the toy|Hamm]]\n* [[Estelle Harris]] as [[Mrs. Potato Head (Toy Story)|Mrs. Potato Head]]\n* [[Jeff Pidgeon]] as [[Squeeze Toy Aliens|Aliens]]\n* [[Jodi Benson]] as [[List of Toy Story characters#Barbie|Barbie]]\n* [[Michael Keaton]] as [[List of Toy Story characters#Ken|Ken]]\n* Emily Hahn as [[Bonnie (Toy Story)|Bonnie]]\n* [[Timothy Dalton]] as [[List of Toy Story characters#Mr. Pricklepants|Mr. Pricklepants]]\n* [[Kristen Schaal]] as [[List of Toy Story characters#Trixie|Trixie]]\n* [[Jeff Garlin]] as [[Buttercup (Toy Story)|Buttercup]]\n* [[Bonnie Hunt]] as [[List of Toy Story characters#Dolly|Dolly]]\n* [[Whoopi Goldberg]] as [[Stretch (Toy Story)|Stretch]]\n* [[Jack Angel]] as [[Chunk (Toy Story)|Chunk]]\n* [[Jan Rabson]] as [[List of Toy Story characters#Sparks|Sparks]]\n* [[John Cygan]] as [[Twitch (Toy Story)|Twitch]]\n* [[Laurie Metcalf]] as [[List of Toy Story characters#Mrs. Davis|Andy's mother]]\n* [[Lori Alan]] as [[List of Toy Story characters#Bonnie's mom|Bonnie's mother]]\n* [[Bea Miller]] as [[Molly (Toy Story)|Molly]]\n* [[R.

The shot-for-shot remake uses the film's original audio, with voice cast including Tom Hanks as Sheriff Woody, Tim Allen as Buzz Lightyear, the late Don Rickles as Mr. Potato Head, Joan Cusack as Jessie, Wallace Shawn as Rex, and many more of your \u201cToy Story\u201d favorites. According to Screen Crush, Pixar's parent company Walt Disney Studios gave the McGrews permissions to release the film online.
