[[H\u00e9ctor Elizondo]], [[Nathan Lane]], and [[Kate Nelligan]] appear in supporting roles. The original score was composed by [[Marvin Hamlisch]].\n\nThe screenplay for ''Frankie and Johnny'' was adapted by [[Terrence McNally]] from his own [[off-Broadway]] play ''[[Frankie and Johnny in the Clair de Lune]]'' (1987), which featured [[F. Murray Abraham]] and [[Kathy Bates]]. The most notable alteration in the film was the addition of several supporting characters and various locations; in the original play, only the two eponymous characters appeared onstage, and the entire drama took place in one apartment.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://theater.nytimes.com/mem/theater/treview.html?res=9B0DE3DA153AF93BA15753C1A961948260 |first=Frank |last=Rich |author-link=Frank Rich |title=Theater: 'Frankie and Johnny' |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=October 28, 1987 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120728210248/http://theater.nytimes.com/mem/theater/treview.html?res=9B0DE3DA153AF93BA15753C1A961948260 |archive-date=July 28, 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe title is a reference to the traditional [[American popular music|American popular song]] \"[[Frankie and Johnny (song)|Frankie and Johnny]]\", first published in 1904, which tells the story of a woman who finds her man making love to another woman and shoots him dead.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.traditionalmusic.co.uk/song-midis/Frankie_and_Johnny.htm |title=Frankie and Johnny |website=Traditional Music Library |access-date=2009-11-17}}</ref> The film received generally favorable reviews and grossed $67 million with a $29 million budget.\n\n==Plot==\nAn emotionally scarred waitress named Frankie attends her godson's [[Infant baptism|baptism]] in [[Altoona, Pennsylvania]]. Meanwhile, a middle-aged man named Johnny is released from prison. Frankie returns home to New York City to her job waitressing at the Apollo Cafe. The owner, Nick, sends her co-worker Helen home early after she complains of dizziness. Johnny arrives looking for work and Nick hires him as a short-order cook despite his criminal record. After work, Frankie returns home to her apartment to find a stranger, Bobby, installing shelves, but he is revealed to be the boyfriend of her friend and neighbor, Tim. That night, Johnny solicits a prostitute, but merely asks her to lie clothed in bed with him.\n\nThe next day, Nick announces to his staff that Helen has been hospitalized. Frankie and her co-worker Cora visit an unconscious Helen and share their fears of dying alone like her. The next day, after helping a man who had an epileptic seizure, Johnny asks Frankie out on a date, but she refuses. Helen dies and Frankie, Cora, and fellow waitress Nedda are surprised to see Johnny at her funeral. Back at work, Johnny asks Frankie out again. After she refuses again, he has a [[one-night stand]] with Cora, which she shares the details of with Frankie and Nedda.\n\nWeeks pass, and Johnny asks Frankie to be his date at a co-worker's going-away party, but she again refuses. He shows up at her apartment anyway, where Bobby and Tim help Frankie decide what to wear. At the party, Johnny attempts to convince Frankie that they are a good match. After the party, he buys her a flower and persuades her to take him back to her apartment, where they spend an intimate night together.\n\nNow convinced that they are meant to be together, Johnny shows up at her [[Ten-pin bowling|bowling]] night and professes his love to her. Frankie argues that he cannot love her after such a short period of time, and reveals that she [[Female infertility|cannot have children]] after Johnny mentions starting a family. Afterwards, Frankie avoids Johnny, not answering his phone calls and switching her shifts. However, Johnny switches his shifts too and they talk to each other. Johnny confesses that he is divorced and has two children whom he has not seen since he got out of prison for [[check fraud]]. Frankie encourages him to see them, and she confesses that her last boyfriend cheated on her with her best friend.\n\nAfter work, Johnny walks Frankie to her apartment, where they discuss their lives and listen to \"[[Suite bergamasque|Clair de lune]]\". However, the intimacy makes Frankie uncomfortable and they argue. She asks him to leave, but before he does, he calls the radio station and asks them to play an encore of \"Clair de lune\". Frankie confesses that a previous boyfriend had [[Domestic violence|physically abused]] her, at one point causing her to have a [[miscarriage]] which made her unable to have children. Frankie invites Johnny to stay and they watch the sunrise together.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Al Pacino]] as Johnny\n* [[Michelle Pfeiffer]] as Frankie\n* [[H\u00e9ctor Elizondo]] as Nick\n* [[Nathan Lane]] as Tim\n* [[Kate Nelligan]] as Cora\n* [[Jane Morris (actress)|Jane Morris]] as Nedda\n* Greg Lewis as Tino\n* Al Fann as Luther\n* [[Ele Keats]] as Artemis\n* Fernando L\u00f3pez as Jorge\n* [[Glenn Plummer]] as Peter\n* [[Sean O'Bryan]] as Bobby\n}}\n\n==Production==\n''[[Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country]]'' was filming in a nearby studio, and [[Garry Marshall]] arranged for the actors [[William Shatner]] ([[James T.
