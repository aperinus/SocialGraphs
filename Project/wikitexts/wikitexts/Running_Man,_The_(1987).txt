The 1987 US film is set in a [[dystopia]]n United States between 2017 and 2019.\n\n''The Running Man'' was a moderate box office success in the United States, grossing $38 million on its $27 million budget, but opened to mixed reviews from critics. A new movie adaptation of the novel, announced in early 2021, is in development at [[Paramount Pictures]], with [[Edgar Wright]] directing and [[Michael Bacall]] writing the script.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.indiewire.com/2021/02/edgar-wright-stephen-king-the-running-man-paramount-1234618155/|title = Edgar Wright Set to Direct Stephen King's Dystopian Classic 'The Running Man'|date = 19 February 2021}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nBy 2017, the United States has become a corrupted [[totalitarian state]] following a worldwide economic collapse and the recent election. The government placates and pacifies the populace through violent TV programs, its most popular being ''The Running Man''; a broadcast [[game show]], where criminals and government dissidents flee from armed gladiators (\"stalkers\"), to earn a [[pardon]] and tropical relocation. \n\nAfter refusing to open fire on them, Ben Richards, a police helicopter pilot, is framed for massacring 60 people in a food panic riot, in [[Bakersfield, California]]. He is subdued by his colleagues and sent to a prison labor camp. Eighteen months later, he leads a bloody prison escape with two underground resistance fighters, Harold Weiss and William Laughlin. Taking temporary refuge with them, their elderly leader, Mic, removes their explosive, prison neck-shackles.\n\nThe resistance group look to hijack the ICS broadcast network's satellite [[uplink]] to expose the government's tyranny and lies. Richards declines to help, opting to flee Los Angeles completely. He heads to his brother's LA high-rise apartment, only to find it is now occupied by corporate composer Amber Mendez and that his brother has been sent to a \"re-education\" camp. With her security/travel pass, Richards takes Mendez hostage, hoping to flee to [[Hawaii]], but is arrested at the airport, when she alerts security.\n\nMeanwhile, Damon Killian, the charismatic, amoral host of the deadly [[Los Angeles]] ''The Running Man'' game show becomes enamored by Richards' physical prowess and now-notorious reputation as a murderous ex-cop. Killian coerces Richards to participate in the show, in exchange for leniency towards Weiss and Laughlin. Meanwhile, news reports claim Richards shot a cop and civilians at the airport, which Mendez knows is untrue. As the game begins, Killian betrays his promise, sending Weiss and Laughlin into the game-show arena with Richards. In this now-abandoned, 1997-earthquake disaster-zone, they are first stalked by Professor Subzero and his bladed hockey-stick in the former [[LA Kings]] ice arena. However, Richards manages to garrote Subzero with a section of razor wire fencing, the first time a stalker has ever been killed on the live TV show.\n\nNow suspicious, Mendez locates the raw, unedited footage of the Bakersfield food-riot massacre in the ICS video archives. However, she is caught, publicly humiliated, and then she too is jettisoned into ''The Running Man'' arena. Joining the other 3 \"contestants\", Killian now deploys two stalkers at once, Buzzsaw and Dynamo, to hunt down the four \"runners\".\n\nWeiss, an electronics/IT hacker, realizes the ICS TV satellite uplink that the rebels have been searching for is located within the game-show arena, but just as Weiss cracks the satellite's security, Dynamo electrocutes him; fortunately however, Mendez has memorized the access code. \nBuzzsaw mortally wounds Laughlin, but Richards bisects Buzzsaw with his own chainsaw. Dynamo is then incapacitated in his overturned dune buggy, but Richards spares the helpless, obese stalker live on air, creating public sympathy for (Richards). Laughlin tells Richards that the resistance has a hidden base in the arena before succumbing to his wounds. \nOff the air, Killian now offers Richards a lucrative TV contract as a \"stalker\", which the enraged Richards vehemently declines, instead promising vengeance upon Killian.\nNext, while hunted by Fireball, a stalker with a jetpack and flamethrower, Mendez finds the corpses of the show's alleged, past \"winners\", revealing that the show's promises of pardon are empty. Richards saves Mendez and incinerates Fireball by sabotaging his fuel supply and setting him alight with a road flare. Immediately afterwards, the pair stumble into the rebels' hidden command center.\n\nWith the viewership now cheering for Richards, Killian insists former stalker and fan favorite Captain Freedom join the hunt. When he honorably refuses to fight armed, the network doctors old TV footage to depict Richards and Mendez being killed by Captain Freedom. Mendez and Richards see this on TV, convincing Richards to lead the assault on the ICS control room. Using the access codes, they broadcast the original footage of the Bakersfield massacre and the deceased runners to expose Killian and the government's corruption. As the resistance fighters battle ICS security forces in the TV studio, Dynamo tries to rape Amber. However, her gunfire triggers the building's sprinkler system, which electrocutes the huge, half naked man.\n\nRichards confronts Killian, who desperately pleads that the show appeases the public's lust for violence, but Richards jettisons him into the gaming zone, fatally crashing through Killian's own billboard image. As the audience celebrates, Richards reunites with Mendez, departing the studio as the ICS broadcasting network goes down.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] as Captain Benjamin Stuart \"Ben\" Richards\n* [[Richard Dawson]] as Damon Killian\n* [[Mar\u00eda Conchita Alonso]] as Amber Mendez\n* [[Jesse Ventura]] as \"Captain Freedom\"\n* [[Yaphet Kotto]] as William Laughlin\n* [[Jim Brown]] as \"Fireball\"\n* [[Erland Van Lidth De Jeude|Erland Van Lidth]] as \"Dynamo\"\n* Marvin J.

Screenwriter [[Steven E. de Souza]] wrote fifteen drafts of the script over the course of the film's development.\n\nPop star [[Paula Abdul]] choreographed the pre-show dance sequences. This was her second film credit, though she had already choreographed four [[Janet Jackson]] videos as well as videos by [[ZZ Top]], [[Duran Duran]], and [[Debbie Gibson]]. The music used for the pre-show entertainment was composed by [[Jackie Jackson]] and was dubbed \"Paula's Theme\" in her honor.\n\nThe film's release was postponed from summer 1987 until [[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving]] due to the producers desire for the film to be the only action thriller released during the holiday season.
