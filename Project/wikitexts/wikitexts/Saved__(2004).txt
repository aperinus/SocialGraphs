Its plot follows a teenage girl (Malone) at a Christian high school who has sex with her boyfriend in an attempt to \"cure\" him of his [[homosexuality]]; she becomes pregnant as a result and is ostracized by her schoolmates. Filmed in [[Vancouver]], British Columbia, the film had its theatrical release on May 28, 2004. ''Saved!'' was considered a [[sleeper hit]], grossing over $9 million domestically following a [[limited release|platform release]] through [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]. The film received mixed reviews from critics, with many remarking on its blend of [[religious satire]] with elements of the contemporary [[teen film]].\n\n==Plot==\nDevout [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical Christian]] teenager Mary Cummings is entering her senior year at American Eagle Christian High School near [[Baltimore]]. She and her two best friends, Hilary Faye and Veronica, have formed a [[girl group]] called the Christian Jewels. One afternoon, Mary's boyfriend, Dean Withers, confesses to her in his pool that he is [[gay]]. In shock, Mary hits her head, and has a vision in which [[Jesus]] tells her that she must help Dean. Believing that Jesus will restore her purity, Mary has sex with Dean in an attempt to rid him of his homosexuality.\n\nDespite Mary's efforts, Dean is sent to Mercy House, a Christian treatment center, after his parents find [[gay pornography]] in his bedroom. The news of Dean's sexuality shocks and disgusts Mary's friends, aside from Roland, Hilary's sardonic, [[paraplegic]] brother. At the school assembly, Cassandra, a rebellious [[Judaism|Jewish]] student who despises Hilary, causes a scene by breaking into obscenities under the guise of [[Glossolalia|speaking in tongues]].\n\nMary develops [[morning sickness]] and soon discovers she is pregnant with Dean's child. Because the child is due after graduation, Mary decides to hide the pregnancy from her classmates, as well as her mother Lillian, who is covertly dating Pastor Skip, the school's divorced principal. Feeling forsaken by Jesus, Mary begins questioning her faith, specifically her peers' response to Dean's sexuality. This horrifies Hilary, who ousts Mary from the Christian Jewels, replacing her with an unpopular student named Tia. In an effort to help Mary, Hilary, Veronica, and Tia accost her in the street and attempt to perform an [[exorcism]] on her. Mary fights them, and Hilary hits her with a Bible.\n\nBy Christmas time, Cassandra is the only one of Mary's peers who realizes Mary is pregnant. Mary soon bonds with Cassandra, who is now dating Roland; the three become close friends while ostracized by Hilary and the rest of their peers. Meanwhile, Pastor Skip's son, Patrick, attempts to pursue Mary, much to Hilary's chagrin, but Mary is evasive. Continually harassed by Hilary, Cassandra and Roland retaliate by uploading photos of a young, overweight Hilary to the school's computer system. The following day, someone vandalizes the school with obscene, anti-religious [[graffiti]]. Pastor Skip suspects Mary, Cassandra, and Roland, and discovers empty spray-paint cans in their lockers, planted by Hilary. Also found is a [[Medical ultrasonography|sonogram]] of Mary's baby, exposing her pregnancy.\n\nCassandra, Mary, and Roland are banned from the impending [[prom]], but not before the former of which is expelled from school. Pastor Skip threatens to break off his relationship with Lillian if she does not send Mary to Mercy House. Meanwhile, Roland discovers empty spray-paint cans in Hilary's van, as well as credit card receipts from purchasing them. Despite being expelled and banned, Cassandra and Roland buy Mary a red dress. Unrelated to the dress-buying, Roland and Cassandra plan to crash the prom with Mary and expose Hilary, along with Patrick, who takes Mary as his date. At the prom, Hilary tries to have them ejected, but Roland confronts her with the receipts for the spray-paint. Tia, who has grown weary of Hilary's lies and [[hypocrisy]], also attests her guilt to Pastor Skip, having discovered additional receipts bearing Hilary's signature.\n\nPublicly humiliated and rejected by Tia and Veronica, Hilary storms outside. Simultaneously, Dean, his boyfriend Mitch, and other residents of Mercy House arrive to crash the prom, and are met by Mary and Patrick in the school foyer. Mary reveals her pregnancy to Dean for the first time. Pastor Skip attempts to force the Mercy House residents out of the prom, but they refuse. Patrick argues with his father, and Mary contends that it is wrong to banish them. Their argument is interrupted by Hilary, who begins driving her van recklessly through the parking lot, ultimately crashing into the school's huge effigy of Jesus. Hilary expresses remorse and is comforted by Cassandra; meanwhile, Mary abruptly goes into labor and is taken to the hospital.\n\nMary gives birth to a baby girl. Pastor Skip arrives at the hospital with flowers, but contemplates going inside. Mary and Dean pose for a photo taken by a nurse with their child alongside Roland, Cassandra, Patrick, Mitch, and Lillian. In a voice-over, Mary explains how she has returned to believing in a God who loves and helps the ones that love and help others in need.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Jena Malone]] as Mary Cummings, a quiet girl who attempts to help her gay ex-boyfriend, Dean, by giving him her virginity, [[Unintended pregnancy|unintentionally becoming pregnant]].\n* [[Mandy Moore]] as Hilary Faye Stockard, the leader of the Christian Jewels and initially Mary's best friend.  She is an extremely devout conservative Christian, though very self-righteous and overbearing, much to the annoyance of others. She reluctantly cares for her handicapped brother, Roland, keeping him on a tight leash.\n* [[Macaulay Culkin]] as Roland Stockard, Hilary Faye's [[Paraplegia|paraplegic]] brother. He fell out of a tree as a child, leaving him paralyzed from the waist down.  Unlike his sister, he does not identify as Christian.\n* [[Eva Amurri]] as Cassandra Edelstein, the only Jewish girl to ever attend American Eagle. She is naturally rebellious and devious on the outside, but when she becomes friends with Mary and lovers with Roland, her true colors show in that she is actually very loyal and open.\n* [[Patrick Fugit]] as Patrick Wheeler, the son of Pastor Skip, the school's principal, and Mary's love interest.\n* Elizabeth Thai as Veronica; adopted from Vietnam by a pair of missionaries, she is the third Christian Jewel.\n* [[Chad Faust]] as Dean Withers, Mary's boyfriend at the beginning of the film. He comes out to Mary as gay.\n* [[Martin Donovan]] as Pastor Skip Wheeler, the principal of American Eagle. A superficially pious and devout minister who is cheating on his wife, Pastor Skip tries to remain \"young and cool\".\n* [[Heather Matarazzo]] as Tia; somewhat of an outsider in the beginning, Tia takes Mary's place in the Jewels when Mary is kicked out. Her father has a drinking problem which disturbs her deeply.\n* [[Mary-Louise Parker]] as Lillian Cummings, Mary's mother, a widow from an early age.\n* [[Kett Turton]] as Mitch, a fellow gay resident of Mercy House who becomes Dean's boyfriend.\n* [[Dave Rosin]], guitarist of the Canadian pop-rock band [[Hedley (band)|Hedley]], appears as the guitarist for the band playing in the prom scene.\n\n==Production==\nDirector and co-writer Brian Dannelly based much of the film on things he had experienced and witnessed while attending a [[Baptists|Baptist Christian]] high school.<ref name=cc>{{cite web|work=Canadian Christianity|url=https://canadianchristianity.com/saved-2037/|title=''Saved!''|last=Chattaway|first=Peter D.|date=September 5, 2004|archive-url=https://archive.today/20190622111117/https://canadianchristianity.com/saved-2037/|archive-date=June 22, 2019}}</ref> \"I would even go so far as to say that everything in the film is something I experienced or researched,\" Dannelly stated. \"I didn\u2019t try to make up stuff.\"<ref name=cc/> Though set in Maryland, ''Saved!'' was filmed in [[Vancouver]], British Columbia, Canada.<ref name=huff/><ref>{{cite web|work=[[White Mountain Independent]]|url=https://www.wmicentral.com/in-saved-moore-plays-a-good-girl-with-a-twist/article_a9c71646-5015-5320-8138-479190755358.html|title=In ''Saved!'', Moore plays a good girl with a twist|last=Dawson|first=Angela|date=June 3, 2004|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190622111647/https://www.wmicentral.com/in-saved-moore-plays-a-good-girl-with-a-twist/article_a9c71646-5015-5320-8138-479190755358.html|archive-date=June 22, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Release==\n===Box office===\nAfter premiering at the [[Sundance Film Festival]] in January 2004, ''Saved!'' had a [[limited release|platform limited release]] in the United States on 20 screens, beginning May 28, 2004.<ref name=bomweekend>{{cite web|url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?page=weekend&id=saved.htm|work=[[Box Office Mojo]]|title=''Saved!'' - Weekend Gross|archive-url=https://archive.today/20190622101723/https://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?page=weekend&id=saved.htm|archive-date=June 22, 2019}}</ref> The film grossed $345,136 during its opening weekend, and an additional 11 screens were added the following weekend.<ref name=bomweekend/> After the film had grossed an additional $340,343 during its second weekend, its release platform expanded to 589 screens on June 11, and it reached number 9 at the U.S. box office.<ref name=bomweekend/> By the conclusion of its theatrical run in August 2004, the film grossed approximately $9 million domestically,<ref name=bomweekend/> and was considered a [[sleeper hit]].<ref name=huff>{{cite web|work=[[HuffPost|The Huffington Post]]|url=https://www.huffpost.com/entry/patrick-fugit-saved-10-years_n_5525934?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAANV__mpn_49Q0CgBzTF9RgTG9danlWuPmri4zT-PJLhLBKogrpZtkswG0SZW6YVGzDElEyB3TnOYo6dMVIjlWgCH4KhK00Cnf9VcHelQGB0QmX2Z00AuEMS0b4HNVU7XvbO0NkcAkXkzlu5XY0AWltO2Ius1uQk9J3IhAaeESvLa|title=Patrick Fugit Remembers 'Saved!' 10 Years Later|date=June 25, 2014|last=Goodman|first=Jessica|archive-url=https://archive.today/20190622110708/https://www.huffpost.com/entry/patrick-fugit-saved-10-years_n_5525934?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAANV__mpn_49Q0CgBzTF9RgTG9danlWuPmri4zT-PJLhLBKogrpZtkswG0SZW6YVGzDElEyB3TnOYo6dMVIjlWgCH4KhK00Cnf9VcHelQGB0QmX2Z00AuEMS0b4HNVU7XvbO0NkcAkXkzlu5XY0AWltO2Ius1uQk9J3IhAaeESvLa|archive-date=June 22, 2019}}</ref> It grossed an additional $1.2 million in foreign markets, totaling $10.1 million worldwide.<ref name=bom>{{cite web|work=[[Box Office Mojo]]|title=''Saved!''|url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?page=main&id=saved.htm|archive-url=https://archive.today/20190622102200/https://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?page=main&id=saved.htm|archive-date=June 22, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n''Saved!'' received generally positive reviews from critics. At critics aggregator site [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film holds a 61% rating of 88 positive reviews against 57 negative ones, with an average rating of 6.12/10. The website's critical consensus reads: \"A satirical teen comedy that, unfortunately, pulls its punches.\"<ref>{{Cite web |title=Saved!

By the end of the movie, mainstream Christian values have not been overthrown, but demonstrated and embraced.

Giddily unmasking the intolerance that often comes cloaked in religious piety, the film exhausts itself long before it's over. But in the spirit of the true Christian charity it ultimately extols, the film's shortcomings are forgivable.<ref>{{cite web|work=[[TV Guide]]|last=Fox|first=Ken|title=Saved!|url=https://www.tvguide.com/movies/saved/review/137490/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190622100900/https://www.tvguide.com/movies/saved/review/137490/|archive-date=June 22, 2019}}</ref>}}\n\n''[[The Christian Science Monitor]]''{{'}}s [[David Sterritt]] gave the film a favorable review, writing: {{blockquote|Not surprisingly, ''Saved!'' has sparked debate in religious circles. Some defend it on grounds linked to fundamentalist ideas - pointing out, for instance, that abortion isn't mentioned as an option until it's too late for Mary to have one anyway. Others find the movie's overall tone too sassy and irreverent for comfort. What the harsher critics miss is that American teenagers tend to face similar sorts of problems in all sorts of social and domestic settings. The most important thing is how they deal with their challenges, and in ''Saved!'' their search for solutions usually has a faith-based inflection, even if it's not always as straight and narrow as believers might wish.<ref>{{cite web|work=[[The Christian Science Monitor]]|title='Saved!' offers message of tolerance amid satire|last=Steritt|first=David|date=May 28, 2004|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171219114245/https://www.csmonitor.com/2004/0528/p15s01-almo.html|url=https://www.csmonitor.com/2004/0528/p15s01-almo.html|archive-date=December 19, 2017}}</ref>}}\n\nSean Axmaker of the ''[[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]]'' wrote of the film: {{blockquote|The skewering of spiritualism, dogma and passive-aggressive prayer groups has an exaggerated absurdity that borders on cartoonish (public shows of devotion is the currency of popularity and social power in this world) and Dannelly's satire is more clever than cutting. Yet he has a deft comic touch and his observation of teenage social dynamics are dead on.
