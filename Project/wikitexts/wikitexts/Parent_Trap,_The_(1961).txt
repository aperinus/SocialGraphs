It grossed $25.1 million at the box office and was nominated for two [[Academy Awards]]. It was broadcast on television, and three television sequels followed the later adventures of the twins. The film was [[The Parent Trap (1998 film)|remade in 1998]] with [[Lindsay Lohan]]. It was released on VHS, in digital stereo LaserDisc format (1986), and on DVD (2002). ''The Parent Trap'' was the second of six films Mills made for Disney.\n\n== Plot ==\nTeenagers Sharon McKendrick and Susan Evers meet at Miss Inch's Summer Camp for Girls. Their identical appearance causes jealousy, resentment, and a rivalry in which they continually get each other in trouble and disrupt camp activities. As punishment, they must spend the remainder of the camp season rooming and dining together in isolation. They overcome their mutual dislike when they discover they are identical twin sisters whom their parents Mitch Evers and Maggie McKendrick separated upon divorcing shortly after their birth. Eager to meet the parents from whom they were separated, they decide to switch places, cut their hair identically, and coach each other on their lives.\n\nIn Boston with her mother and grandparents, Susan poses as Sharon, while Sharon goes to Mitch's California ranch as Susan. Sharon learns that Mitch is engaged to a beautiful and much younger woman, [[gold digger]] Vicky Robinson, who intends to send Susan to boarding school after the wedding. The girls communicate by phone at night. Susan tells Sharon to break up the couple, but when that fails, Susan decides to end the charade. After a happy reunion, Maggie brings her to California. Mitch is upset by Maggie's unexpected arrival, until he learns the truth and is reunited with both daughters. Vicky is jealous of Maggie, who is staying at the ranch.\n\nThe girls scheme to reunite their parents by recreating Maggie and Mitch's first date. At first, the ex-spouses are drawn together, but then they argue over why they divorced. They make up before Maggie and Sharon are to leave the next morning, and Maggie wishes Mitch well with Vicky. To delay the return to Boston, the twins dress alike so their parents cannot tell them apart, refusing to reveal their identities only after a family camping trip. Mitch and Maggie reluctantly agree, and Vicky, who loathes the outdoors, is furious. Maggie cajoles Vicky into taking her place, so she can become better acquainted with the twins.\n\nThe twins take every opportunity to exploit Vicky's hatred of camping, pulling a series of pranks on her. That night, the twins sneak into her tent and pour honey on her feet. The next morning, Vicky screams as bear cubs start licking and by extension tickling her bare feet. Mitch finally sees exasperated Vicky's true nature when she throws a tantrum, angrily slaps Susan, and storms off enraged to the city, for good.\n\nBack at the house, the twins apologize for their actions. Maggie and Sharon prepare to return to Boston the next day, the twins now resigned to only seeing each other during visits and shuttling back-and-forth between parents. Later, Mitch tells Maggie everything he misses about her and their marriage. They realize that they still love each other and do not want to grow into old, lonely people. Susan wakes up during the night and tells Sharon about a beautiful dream she has, where they are bridesmaids at their parents' wedding, a dream destined to come true.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Hayley Mills]] as Sharon McKendrick / Susan Evers, identical twins who were separated shortly after birth when their parents divorced.
