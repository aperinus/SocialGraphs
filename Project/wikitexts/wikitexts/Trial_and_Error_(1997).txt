The film's plot concerns an attorney and his actor friend, who takes his place in court to defend his boss's hopelessly guilty relative.\n\nIt was the final New Line Cinema film to have a [[Turner Broadcasting System|Turner]] byline at the bottom of the logo, before it was acquired by [[WarnerMedia|Time Warner]] on October 10, 1996.\n\n== Plot ==\nCharlie Tuttle has just been made partner in a successful law firm, Whitfield and Morris. His boss and future father-in-law sends him to [[Paradise, Nevada|Paradise Bluff, Nevada]], to request a [[continuance]] in a mail fraud case involving a cousin-in-law who is likely to be found guilty. But the timing of the trip conflicts with Charlie's bachelor party. After Charlie drives from California to Paradise Bluff, he is unexpectedly greeted by his best man, actor Richard Rietti, who is determined to show his friend a great time prior to his wedding.\n\nDuring the celebration, Charlie is knocked out in a barfight, and is later prescribed painkillers for the resulting pain. The next day &mdash; the day of the court appearance &mdash; Richard checks on his friend and finds Charlie has taken all of the pills in the bottle. Charlie winds up in no shape to appear in court that day, as [[legal counsel]] for con artist Benny Gibbs, so Richard impersonates Charlie. When the case unexpectedly goes to trial, Richard and Charlie must continue the charade, or they both will go to prison for perpetrating a fraud upon the court.\n\nCharlie coaches Richard as to the use of the [[Federal Rules of Evidence|rules of evidence]], masquerading as Richard's \"assistant\", surreptitiously using flash cards to tell Richard which basis for objection to use. Charlie eventually loses his temper and screams at the Judge Paul Graff, trying to overrule Charlie, when Richard disobeys Charlie and takes the \"defense\" in a broader direction, and Charlie is banned from reentering the courthouse. Later, Richard and Charlie devise a communication system involving a [[baby monitor]] and [[morse code|morse-code]] sounding of Charlie's vehicle's horn, heard through an open window, to instruct Richard as to which type of objection to use.\n\nDuring the course of the story, Charlie meets and falls in love with an attractive waitress named Billie Tyler who causes Charlie to rethink his impending wedding to his shrill, self-absorbed fianc\u00e9e, Tiffany. As the trial nears its end, Richard becomes involved with the prosecutor, Elizabeth against whom he ultimately finds [[due process]] for \"his client\".\n\n== Cast ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

''Trial and Error'' and earned only around $13 million domestically against a $25 million budget, and holds a rating of 50% on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on 36 reviews. The site's consensus states: \"''Trial and Error'' gets some laughs out of the comedic chemistry between its pleasantly mismatched leads, although the results are still somewhat less than memorable.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1077494-trial_and_error|title=Trial and Error (1997)|work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]}}</ref>\n\nPositive appraisals came from [[Roger Ebert]] and [[Leonard Maltin]], both awarding it three stars out of a possible four. Ebert thought the film was reminiscent of [[Billy Wilder]]'s understated comedies, which \"got a lot of the laughs by playing scenes straight\" rather than going for obvious comedic gags.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/trial-and-error-1997 | title=Trial and Error movie review & film summary (1997) &#124; Roger Ebert }}</ref> Many critics noted similarities to director [[Jonathan Lynn]]'s earlier critically and commercially successful courtroom comedy ''[[My Cousin Vinny]]''. [[Austin Pendleton]], who played defense attorney John Gibbons in ''My Cousin Vinny'', also appeared in ''Trial and Error'', this time as the judge.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|0120373}}\n* {{rotten-tomatoes|1077494-trial_and_error}}\n* {{Mojo title|trialanderror}}\n\n{{Jonathan Lynn}}\n\n[[Category:1997 films]]\n[[Category:1997 romantic comedy films]]\n[[Category:1990s English-language films]]\n[[Category:1990s screwball comedy films]]\n[[Category:American courtroom films]]\n[[Category:American screwball comedy films]]\n[[Category:Films about actors]]\n[[Category:Films about lawyers]]\n[[Category:Films set in Nevada]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Jonathan Lynn]]\n[[Category:Films produced by Jonathan Lynn]]\n[[Category:Legal comedy films]]\n[[Category:New Line Cinema films]]\n[[Category:1990s American films]]"}]}}}}
