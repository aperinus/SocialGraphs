Blending elements of [[fantasy film|fantasy]], [[historical drama|history]], [[spirituality]], and [[science fiction film|science fiction]], the film consists of three storylines involving immortality and the resulting loves lost, and one man's pursuit of avoiding this fate in this life or beyond it. Jackman and Weisz play sets of characters bonded by love across time and space: a conquistador and his ill-fated queen, a modern-day scientist and his cancer-stricken wife, and a traveler immersed in a universal journey alongside aspects of his lost love. The storylines\u2014interwoven with use of [[match cut]]s and recurring visual [[Motif (visual arts)|motifs]]\u2014reflect the themes and interplay of love and mortality.\n\nAronofsky originally planned to direct ''The Fountain'' on a $70 million budget with [[Brad Pitt]] and [[Cate Blanchett]] in the lead roles, but Pitt's withdrawal and [[cost overrun]]s led [[Warner Bros.]] to shut down his production. The director rewrote the script to be sparser, and was able to resurrect the film with a $35 million budget with Jackman and Weisz in the lead roles. [[Principal photography]] began from November 2004 to February 2005,<ref name=\"production\" /> and mainly took place on a sound stage in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]]. Aronofsky used [[macro photography]] to create key visual effects for ''The Fountain'' at a low cost.\n\nThe film was released theatrically in the United States and Canada on November 22, 2006. It grossed $10,144,010 in the United States and Canada and $5,761,344 in other territories for a worldwide total of $15,978,422. Critics' reactions to the film were divided, but it has gained a [[Cult film|cult following]] since its release.<ref name=collide>{{cite web|url=https://collider.com/the-fountain-explained/|title=''The Fountain'' Has Nothing to Do with Time|publisher=[[Collider (website)|Collider]]|last=Goldberg|first=Matt|date=November 22, 2016|access-date=September 7, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://moviemezzanine.com/the-darren-aronofsky-retrospective-fountain/|title=The Darren Aronofsky Retrospective: 'The Fountain' - Movie Mezzanine|website=moviemezzanine.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.soundonsight.org/unsung-gems-the-fountain-features-one-of-the-most-unforgettable-film-climaxes-of-all-time/|title=Unsung Gems - 'The Fountain' features one of the most unforgettable film climaxes of all time - PopOptiq|date=October 1, 2012}}</ref>\n\n== Plot ==\n[[File:Berruguete, Pedro - Burning of the Heretics (Auto-da-f\u00e9) - c. 1500.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=A painting of an Inquisitor sitting on a throne before a large crowd|One of the film's narratives takes place during the [[Spanish Inquisition]].]] [[Conquistador]] Tom\u00e1s Verde in [[New Spain]] fights a band of [[Maya civilization|Mayans]] to gain entry into a [[pyramid]], where he is attacked by a Mayan priest. The story intercuts to a similar looking man, tending a tall tree in a glass dome biosphere travelling through space, annoyed by a woman called Izzi. Finally, a third iteration, present-day surgeon Tom Creo, is losing his wife Izzi to a [[brain tumor]]. Tom is working on a cure using samples from a tree found through exploration in [[Guatemala]], which are being tested for medicinal use for [[degenerative diseases|degenerative]] [[brain diseases]] in his lab. Izzi has come to terms with her mortality, but Tom refuses to accept it, focused on his quest to find a cure for her. She writes a story called \"The Fountain\" about [[Isabella I of Castile|Queen Isabella]] losing her kingdom to the [[Inquisition]] and a commission given by her to Tom\u00e1s Verde to search for the [[Tree of Life]] in the [[Central America]]n forest in [[Maya civilization|Mayan]] territory. As she does not expect to finish her book, Izzi asks Tom to finish it for her. As they look up at the golden [[nebula]] of [[Xibalba]], she imagines, as the Mayans did, that their souls will meet there after death when the star goes [[supernova]]. She dies shortly thereafter and Tom dedicates himself to curing not only her disease but death itself after seeing experimental success in reversing aging. His colleagues fear that this drive has made him reckless, but they support him in his scientific work and emotionally at Izzi's funeral. Tom plants a [[Liquidambar|sweetgum]] seed at Izzi's grave in the manner of a story she told him relating how a Mayan guide's dead father lived on in a tree nourished by the organic nutrients of the buried body.\n\nIn the Mayan jungle, Tom\u00e1s finds that most of his fellow knights are exhausted and refuse to continue searching for the [[Tree of life (biblical)|Tree of Life]]. After a failed coup and the death of their priest guide, he takes the few who remain loyal with him to a pyramid, carrying a ceremonial dagger. Once he arrives at the pyramid, the first scene repeats and Tom\u00e1s engages in combat with the Mayan priest. The space traveller (whether this character is a version of Tom, an element of Izzy's story, or Tom himself in the future is unclear) spends much of his time performing physical or mental exercises, including a form of meditation allowing him to perceive and interact with the past. In that past, Tom\u00e1s is stabbed in the stomach but, just as the priest is about to kill him, he appears before the figurehead. The priest now believes Tom\u00e1s is the \"First Father\" who birthed all life. Tom\u00e1s kills the priest as a sacrifice and proceeds to a pool with a large tree, convinced this is the Tree of Life. Tom\u00e1s applies some of its sap to his torso and is cured of his stab wound. He drinks the sap flowing from the bark. But in a reenactment of the Mayan creation myth recounted earlier, his body is turned into flowers and grass that burst forth from it and he literally gives rise to new life, killing himself in the process. In space, the tree finally dies just before the spaceship arrives at its destination, much to the horror of the version of Tom tending it. A final vision of Izzi appears, comforting him in the face of his acceptance of death. The star goes supernova, engulfing the ship and everything within. The traveler's body, engulfed by the dying star inside of the nebula, is absorbed by the tree, causing it to flourish back to life. Izzi's apparition picks a fruit from the new tree of life and hands it to Tom, who plants it in Izzi's grave, accepting her death and moving on.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Hugh Jackman]] as Tom\u00e1s Verde / Thomas Creo / Tommy the Space Traveler: <br />A 16th-century Spanish conquistador set out in the deep jungles of [[South America]] to find the [[elixir of life]] that was purported to come from the [[Fountain of Youth]] springing forth from a tree atop a Mayan pyramid, where he fiercely fought a [[Maya priesthood|Mayan high priest]].<ref name=slate>{{cite news|url=https://slate.com/culture/2006/11/darren-aronofsky-s-the-fountain-reviewed.html|title=Darren Aronofsky's ''The Fountain'' reviewed|last=Stevens|first=Dana|date=November 2, 2016|publisher=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]|access-date=September 7, 2019}}</ref> In the present, a scientist discovers a South American tree with promising life-extending properties in an attempt to cure his wife of brain cancer.

Related to this path, Darren Aronofsky described the core of the film as \"a very simple love story\" about a man and a woman in love, with the woman's life cut short. The director researched people who were dying young, and learned from doctors and caregivers that such patients find new ways of coping. Aronofsky observed that the patients often die more alone because their families cannot recognize what happens with them, calling it \"an incredible tragedy\":\n\n<blockquote>Instead of facing this tragedy in terror, she is coming to terms with what is happening to her... Many patients actually start opening up to the possibility of what's happening to them, but there's very little vocabulary to help them deal...

The film begins with a paraphrase of [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 3:24, the Biblical passage that reflects [[The Fall of Man]]. Hugh Jackman emphasized the importance of the Fall in the film: \"The moment [[Adam and Eve]] ate of the [[Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil]], humans started to experience life as we all experience it now, which is life and death, poor and wealthy, pain and pleasure, good and evil. We live in a world of duality. Husband, wife, we relate everything. And much of our lives are spent not wanting to die, be poor, experience pain. It's what the movie's about.\"<ref name=\"cover\" /> Aronofsky also interpreted the story of Genesis as the definition of mortality for humanity. He inquired of the Fall, \"If they had drank from the Tree of Life [along with the Tree of Knowledge] what would have separated them from their maker? So what makes us human is actually death. It's what makes us special.\"<ref name=\"slashfilm2\">{{cite news | last=Sciretta | first=Peter | url=https://www.slashfilm.com/article.php/20061121aronofskyinterview2 | title=Interview: Darren Aronofsky, director of The Fountain, Part 2 | work=/FILM | date=November 21, 2006 | access-date=December 19, 2006}}</ref>\n\nAronofsky's sensibility can be placed between Kubrick's exploration of humanity, and Spielberg's emotionality as he \"combines elements of Kubrick\u2019s excess visible in the human condition and leading us toward the limit of existence in obsession or madness, and of Spielberg\u2019s emotion and the wish to leave a ray of hope, regardless of how\nhopeless the situation might be.\"<ref>Skorin-Kapov, Jadranka (2015) ''Darren Aronofsky's Films and the Fragility of Hope'', p. 66, [[Bloomsbury Academic]] {{isbn|978-1501306976}}</ref>\n\n== Production ==\n=== Development ===\n[[File:Rachel Weisz.jpg|thumb|Production on ''The Fountain'' went through several stages of casting.

When Aronofsky saw ''[[The Matrix]]'' in 1999, he considered it a film that redefined the science fiction genre. He sought to make a science fiction film that would explore new territory in the genre like ''The Matrix'' and its predecessors ''[[Star Wars]]'' and ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]''. Aronofsky had in mind a science fiction film that would go beyond the other films whose plots were driven by technology and science. The director said, \"We've seen it all. It's not really interesting to audiences anymore. The interesting things are the ideas; the search for God, the search for meaning.\"<ref name=\"epic\" />\n\nIn 1999, when Aronofsky turned 30 years old, his parents were diagnosed with cancer. He began reflecting on human mortality, \"That was a really heavy-duty emotional time. I know it's a very young age, but turning thirty marks when your twenties are over and you could start considering, 'Wow, one of these days I'm actually going to die.'\" While his parents overcame cancer, he began to focus on the concept of a young man saving a loved one from a life-threatening disease. He shared the concept with Handel, his undergraduate school roommate at [[Harvard University]]. Handel earned a Ph.D in [[neuroscience]] from [[New York University]] but was uncertain about a future in neuroscience.

The pair was assigned the task of creating as little [[computer-generated imagery]] as possible, a difficult task with a third of the film taking place in deep space. Aronofsky chose to avoid effects that would make the film look dated in several decades but instead hold up as well as a film like ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]''. Dawson said, \"Using CG is really the easy route because it's so prevalent and the tools are great. What it did was really force us to come up with creative solutions to solve a lot of our problems.\"\n\nOne creative solution was uncovering Peter Parks, a specialist in [[macro photography]], who had retrieved deep-sea [[microorganism]]s and photographed them in [[3-D film|3-D]] under partial funding from the [[Bahamas]] government. Parks brewed chemicals and bacteria together to create reactions that Schrecker and Dawson shot, recording 20,000 feet worth of film over eight weeks.<ref name=\"makers\" /> To create the effects, Peter Parks took advantage of [[fluid dynamics]], which affected the behavior of the substances that he photographed. \"When these images are projected on a big screen, you feel like you're looking at infinity. That's because the same forces at work in the water\u2014gravitational effects, settlement, refractive indices\u2014are happening in outer space,\" Parks said. The specialist's talent convinced the film's creative department to go beyond computer-generated imagery and follow Parks' lead. Instead of millions of dollars for a single special effects sequence, Parks generated all the footage for the film for just $140,000.<ref name=\"outsider\" />\n\nThe visual-effects company Look Effects worked on 87 shots for ''The Fountain'' that included major set extensions, digital [[matte (filmmaking)|mattes]], image enhancement, face replacement and blemish removal, as well as animating key elements to the film's story.
