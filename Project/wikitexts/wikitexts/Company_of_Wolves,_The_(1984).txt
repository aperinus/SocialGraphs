The screenplay was written by Jordan and [[Angela Carter]], and adapted by Carter from her [[The Bloody Chamber#The Company of Wolves|short story of the same name]] (featured in her 1979 short story collection ''[[The Bloody Chamber]]'')<ref name=\"dare85\">{{Cite web| title= In the Company of Neil Jordan | first= Michael |last= Dare | work= [[LA Weekly]] | url= http://www.dareland.com/emulsionalproblems/jordan.htm | publisher= via dareland.com (the author's official website) | date= 19 April 1985| access-date= 20 September 2010| quote= Angela Carter ... told me she was interested in bringing one of the short stories in ''The Bloody Chamber'' to the screen....The story is only 12 pages long, so we built upon it in layers.}}</ref> and its 1980 [[radio programming|radio]] adaptation. Carter's first draft of the screenplay, which contains some differences from the finished film, has been published in her anthology ''[[The Curious Room]]'' (1996).\n\n==Plot==\nThe film begins in the present day, within a [[country house]]. A young girl named Rosaleen ([[Sarah Patterson]]) dreams that she lives in a fairytale forest during the late 18th century with her parents (Tusse Silberg and [[David Warner (actor)|David Warner]]) and sister Alice ([[Georgia Slowe]]). But one night Alice is chased down and killed by wolves. While her parents are mourning, Rosaleen goes to stay with her grandmother ([[Angela Lansbury]]), who knits a bright red shawl for her granddaughter to wear. The superstitious old woman gives Rosaleen an ominous warning, \"Never stray from the path, never eat a windfall apple, and never trust a man whose [[Unibrow|eyebrows meet]].\" Rosaleen returns to her village, but finds that she must deal with the advances of an amorous boy (Shane Johnstone). Rosaleen and the boy take a walk through the forest, but the boy discovers that the village's cattle have come under attack from a wolf. The villagers set out to hunt the wolf; but once caught and killed, the wolf's corpse transforms into that of a human being.\n\nRosaleen later takes a basket of goods through the woods to her grandmother's cottage; but on her way, she encounters an attractive huntsman (Micha Bergese) whose eyebrows meet. He challenges her, saying that he can find his way to her grandmother's house before she can, and the pair set off. The hunter arrives at Rosaleen's grandmother's house first, where he reveals his bestial nature and kills her. Rosaleen arrives later and discovers the carnage, but her need to protect herself is complicated by her desire for the hunter. In the ensuing exchange, Rosaleen accidentally injures the huntsman with his own rifle. Upon this blow, the hunter contorts in pain and transforms into his wolf shape. A deeply remorseful Rosaleen apologizes and takes pity on the wounded beast, musing that his pack could leave him behind in his state. She sits down and begins petting the wolf caringly and tenderly, comforting him while telling him a story.\n\nUltimately the villagers arrive at the house sometime later, looking for a werewolf within. Instead, they discover that Rosaleen herself has become a werewolf. Together, she and the huntsman, her new mate, escape to the forest, joined by a growing pack. The wolves seem to stream into the real world, breaking into Rosaleen's house and gathering outside her bedroom. Rosaleen awakes with a scream as one leaps in through the window and sends her toys crashing to the floor, symbolizing the end of her childhood innocence.\n\n[[Charles Perrault|Perrault]]'s ''[[Little Red Riding Hood|Le Petit Chaperon Rouge]]'' is then heard being read, with the moral warning girls to beware of charming strangers.\n\n===Granny's tales and Rosaleen's stories===\nThroughout the course of the film, a number of stories are interspersed into the main narrative as tales told by several of the characters:\n\n* Granny's tale to Rosaleen\u2014A young groom ([[Stephen Rea]]) whose eyebrows meet is about to bed his new bride (Kathryn Pogson) when a \"call of nature\" summons him outside. He disappears and his bride is terrified to see wolves howling outside. A search the following day yields a wolf pawprint only. Believing he was killed by wolves while going to the bathroom, she remarries and has children, only to have her original husband finally return years later. Angered at her having children with a new husband, the groom transforms into his werewolf form, but is killed when the new husband ([[Jim Carter (actor)|Jim Carter]]) returns.\n* Granny's second tale to Rosaleen\u2014A young man whose eyebrows meet, the bastard son of a priest, is walking through the enchanted forest when he encounters the Devil ([[Terence Stamp]]), anachronistically arriving in a [[Rolls-Royce (car)|Rolls-Royce]] chauffeured by the actress playing Rosaleen in a blonde wig. The Devil offers the boy a transformative potion, which he rubs onto his chest, causing hair to sprout rapidly. The boy is pleased, but shortly thereafter vines grow swiftly from the ground, twining around his legs and trapping him. He wails in protest and fear, his face distorting with his cries. His anguished visage appearing in Rosaleen's bedroom mirror at the end of that dream sequence.\n* Rosaleen's story to her mother\u2014A woman (Dawn Archibald) who lived in a valley \"done a terrible wrong\" by a rich, young nobleman ([[Richard Morant]]) turns up visibly pregnant at his wedding party \"to put wrong to right\". She calls out the nobleman and the rest of the nobles for their bigoted actions, and further denounces them by declaring \"the wolves in the forest are more decent\". She then reveals that she is a enchantress and magically transforms the groom, the bride, and all the other nobles into wolves. They flee into the forest as the enchantress laughs; but afterward, the enchantress commands that the wolves \"serenade\" her and her child each night.\n* Rosaleen's story to the huntsman/wolf\u2014A she-wolf from the world beneath arrives at a village. Despite meaning no harm, she is shot and injured by a villager. She reveals herself in her human form ([[Danielle Dax]]) to an old priest ([[Graham Crowden]]) who takes her in and bandages her wound, seeing her innocence. Although touched by the priest's compassion and actions, she feels that she is not fit to stay. Ultimately, after some time, she returns to her world through the village well.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Sarah Patterson]] as Rosaleen\n*[[Angela Lansbury]] as Granny\n*[[David Warner (actor)|David Warner]] as Father\n*Tusse Silberg as Mother\n*Micha Bergese as Huntsman (his first role in a feature film)\n*[[Brian Glover]] as Amorous Boy's father\n*[[Graham Crowden]] as Old Priest\n*[[Kathryn Pogson]] as Young Bride\n*[[Stephen Rea]] as Young Groom\n*[[Georgia Slowe]] as Alice, Girl Killed by Wolves\n*Susan Porrett as Amorous Boy's mother\n*Shane Johnstone as Amorous Boy\n*Dawn Archibald as Witch Woman\n*[[Richard Morant]] as Wealthy Groom\n*[[Danielle Dax]] as Wolfgirl (a non-speaking role)\n*[[Jim Carter (actor)|Jim Carter]] as Second Husband (uncredited)\n*[[Terence Stamp]] as The Devil (uncredited)\n\n==Production==\n\n===Writing===\nAngela Carter, author of the original short story \"The Company of Wolves\", worked with director Neil Jordan on the script for the film. This was Carter's first experience of writing for film. However, it was also only Jordan's second feature film as director.\n\nWhilst ultimately based upon the short story of the same name from ''[[The Bloody Chamber]]'',<ref name=\"dare85\"/> the plot of the film bears closer resemblance to Angela Carter's 1980 adaptation of \"The Company of Wolves\" for radio, which introduced such elements as the additional stories being told within the narrative by the characters themselves, such as Granny.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} Originally, these stories had been placed before the main narrative.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}\n\nCarter and Jordan met in [[Dublin]] in 1982 to discuss extending Carter's radio drama adaptation of her own story, which Jordan called \"too short for a feature film\".<ref name=\"Neil CR\">Neil Jordan quoted in the production notes to Angela Carter's ''The Curious Room'' (London: Vintage, 1997), p 507.</ref>\n\nIn an ''[[L.A. Weekly]]'' interview published to correspond with the film's US debut, Jordan said: \"In a normal film you have a story with different movements that program, develop, go a little bit off the trunk, come back, and end. In this film, the different movements of the plot are actually separate stories. You start with an introduction and then move into different stories that relate to the main theme, all building to the fairy tale that everybody knows. The opening element of the dreamer gave us the freedom to move from story to story.\"<ref name=\"dare85\"/>  According to Jordan,{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} it was he who suggested adding the [[frame story]] to the narrative: that of the dreaming girl Rosaleen in the modern day. This makes clear the story's focus on subconscious fears and desires. It also gives the film what Jordan called \"a [[Chinese boxes|Chinese box]] structure.\"<ref name=\"Neil CR\"/> This structure was supposedly{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} based upon the structure of the film ''[[The Saragossa Manuscript (film)|The Saragossa Manuscript]]'', which both Jordan and Carter had seen.\n\nThe script reached its third draft by July 1983.<ref>Mark Bell, production notes to Angela Carter's ''The Curious Room'' (London: Vintage, 1997), p 507.</ref>\n\nCarter's proposed ending for the film would have featured Rosaleen diving into the floor of her bedroom and being swallowed up as by water. In the DVD commentary for the film, Jordan notes that the limited technology of the time prevented the production of such a sequence, whereas later [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] effects would in fact make it quite simple.<ref name=AC>Neil Jordan, audio commentary to ''The Company of Wolves'' (ITC, 1984), (DVD: 2005).</ref> The original screenplay (as presented in ''The Curious Room'') also featured an additional story being told by the huntsman, a very different final tale by Rosaleen (reminiscent of Carter's \"Peter and the Wolf\" from her collection ''[[Black Venus (short story collection)|Black Venus]]'') and a scene set in a church with an animal congregation.<ref>Angela Carter, \"The Company of Wolves\" in ''The Curious Room'' (London: Vintage, 1997), p 185-244.</ref>\n\nThe budget was provided by ITC Distributors.<ref name=\"times\"/>\n\n===Principal photography===\n''The Company of Wolves'' was filmed in [[Shepperton Studios]] in England. The film's cast was primarily made up of British actors. Sarah Patterson made her screen debut, despite being much younger than the kind of actress the casting director had been looking for, and likely too young to understand some of the film's more adult concepts.<ref name=\"Doss\"/> Her youth also meant having to make special arrangements with her school in order for her to be away for nine weeks while shooting took place.<ref name=\"Doss\">Anonymous, \"''The Company of Wolves'' Behind the Scenes Dossier\" (2005; insert with special edition DVD).</ref> [[Northern Ireland|Northern Irish]] actor Stephen Rea had already worked with director Neil Jordan in ''[[Angel (1982 Irish film)|Angel]]'' and would later work with him again in ''[[The Crying Game]]'', ''[[Interview with the Vampire (film)|Interview with the Vampire]]'' and ''[[Breakfast on Pluto]]'', amongst others.\n\nJordan worked for several weeks in pre-production with artist filmmakers [[Nichola Bruce]] and Michael Coulson to create hundreds of detailed storyboard drawings. Also involved with production was production designer [[Anton Furst]] and his draftsman Nigel Phelps, who would later go on to work on [[Tim Burton]]'s ''[[Batman (1989 film)|Batman]]''. The film's visuals were of particular importance, as Jordan explains:<blockquote>The visual design was an integral part of the script. It was written and imagined with a heightened sense of reality in mind.<ref name=\"Neil CR\"/></blockquote> In the DVD commentary, Jordan notes the difficulty of having to create the look of the film on a limited budget, having to create a fairytale forest out of essentially \"twelve trees\".<ref name=AC/> He nevertheless succeeded in creating a sunless, mystical, wondrous and claustrophobic setting saturated with fantastic elements and symbols.\n\nThe script calls for a great number of wolves to appear. Due to budgetary constraints and other factors such as cast safety, most of the 'wolves' shown in the film are in fact evidently [[Belgian Shepherd Dog]]s, mainly Terveurens and Groenendals, whose fur was specially dyed. In the DVD commentary for the film, Jordan notes the bravery of young star Sarah Patterson when acting amongst the genuine wolves.<ref name=AC/> Using particular light angles, the eyes of both real and \"shepherd\" wolves are made to glow dramatically in the film.\n\nJordan notes how Carter was \"thrilled with the process\" of making a film, as she \"had never really been involved with one.\"<ref name=\"Neil CR\"/> After the film, Jordan and Carter looked for other projects which they could work on together. However, no others came to fruition, partly because of Carter's later illness. According to Jordan, he and Carter discussed a possible adaptation of ''Vampirella'', Carter's radio play which served as the original version of her short story \"The Lady of the House of Love\" from ''The Bloody Chamber''. This is not to be confused with the actual film ''[[Vampirella (film)|Vampirella]]'', released in 1996 and based upon the comic book [[Vampirella|character of the same name]].\n\n==Release==\nThe film received its world premiere at the [[Toronto International Film Festival]] in Canada on 15 September 1984. It was released in the United Kingdom on 21 September and was released in the United States on 19 April 1985 where it was shown in 995 theatres.\n\n===Distribution===\nThe film was distributed in the United States by [[Cannon Films]]. Jordan notes that Cannon pushed the concept of the film as primarily a [[horror film]]. Jordan maintains that it is not a horror film and that such a label might actually be misleading to audiences.<ref name=AC/>\n\n===Home video===\nThe film was later released on VHS in numerous countries. A [[DVD region code#1|Region 1]] DVD release came several years later on 15 October 2002. A [[DVD region code#2|Region 2]] special edition version of the film was released on 17 October 2005, approximately 20 years after the film's initial release in theatres. This special edition came in a metal case and included an [[audio commentary]] by director Neil Jordan, stills galleries, the film's theatrical trailer and a printed \"Behind the Scenes Dossier\". This special edition version was also released on [[Universal Media Disc]] for the [[Sony]] [[PlayStation Portable]] on 30 January 2006. The film was released on [[Blu-ray]] in 2007 in United Kingdom by [[ITV plc|ITV]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Company Of Wolves (The) (Blu-ray) (1984)|url=http://www.dvdcompare.net/comparisons/film.php?fid=12203|website=Rewind|access-date=29 August 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Critical response===\nFeminist critic Maggie Anwell decried the film for its over-emphasis on bloody werewolf special effects,<ref>Anwell, Maggie (1988), 'Lolita Meets the Werewolf: The Company of Wolves\u2019 in Lorraine Gamman and Margaret Marshment (eds), ''The Female Gaze: Women as Viewers of Popular Culture'', London: Women\u2019s Press, pp. 76\u201385.</ref> but another, Charlotte Crofts, argues that the film is a sensitive adaptation of Carter's reworking of [[Charles Perrault]]'s ''[[Little Red Riding Hood]]'' [[fairy tale]].<ref>Crofts, Charlotte (1999), 'Curiously Downbeat Hybrid or Radical Retelling?: Neil Jordan's and Angela Carter's The Company of Wolves\u2019 in Cartmell, Hunter, Kaye and Whelehan (eds), ''Sisterhoods Across the Literature / Media Divide'' (London and Sterling, Virginia: Pluto Press), pp 48\u201363; Crofts, Charlotte (2003), ''[[Anagrams of Desire]]: Angela Carter's Writing for Radio, Film and Television'' (Manchester University Press).</ref>\n\n[[Colin Greenland]] reviewed ''The Company of Wolves'' for ''[[Imagine (game magazine)|Imagine]]'' magazine, and stated that \"It's a Freudian fairytale with deliciously gruesome transformation scenes and deep, vigorous imagery, but not without twee patches.\"<ref name=\"Imagine21\">{{cite journal | last = Greenland|first = Colin |author-link=Colin Greenland| title =Fantasy Media  | type = review | journal = [[Imagine (AD&D magazine)|Imagine]] | issue = 21| pages =55 | publisher = TSR Hobbies (UK), Ltd. |date=December 1984| issn = }}</ref>\n\nIn April 1985, upon the film's US debut, [[Roger Ebert]] gave the film three stars out of four, and called it a \"disturbing and stylish attempt to collect some of the nightmares that lie beneath the surface of \"'[[Little Red Riding Hood]]'\".<ref>{{Cite web| title= The Company of Wolves |url= https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/the-company-of-wolves-1985 |last= Ebert |first=Roger |author-link= Roger Ebert |date= 22 April 1985 |publisher=[[Chicago Sun-Times]] |access-date= 30 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nYears later, [[Louise Watson]], writing for [[BFI Screenonline]], said Neil Jordan \"evokes an eerie, dreamlike atmosphere for the film's heightened reality.
