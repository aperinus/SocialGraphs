The film is directed and co-written by [[Bob Clark]]. Unlike the previous film, Porky himself does not appear. A sequel, ''[[Porky's Revenge!]]'', was released in 1985.\n\n==Plot==\nThe Angel Beach High School Drama Club is producing a [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] Festival in which the group from the first film is participating. A religious leader named Bubba Flavel wants to halt the production because his group, \"The Righteous Flock,\" believe Shakespeare is indecent and profane. Flavel recruits the support of the local [[Ku Klux Klan]] chapter by informing them that the Festival will feature an interracial kiss between John Henry, a [[Seminole]] student playing [[Romeo Montague|Romeo]], and a white [[Juliet]] played by Wendy. The students seek the help of County Commissioner Gebhardt, who promises to pull some strings to keep the Festival running. Gebhardt reneges on his promise after his aide delivers a stack of 5,000 petitions from voters that Flavel gathered. Meanwhile, the Klan attacks and beats John Henry. Though the Angel Beach principal, Mr. Carter, enthusiastically supports his students, he is forced to cancel the Festival after the county commissioners voted against it. The Angel Beach students plot revenge against Flavel, Commissioner Gebhardt, the rest of the county commissioners, and the Klan.\n\nThe teens discover that the county commissioners, while publicly espousing decency and morality, secretly gather to watch [[stag film]]s in the courthouse basement. The students takes a tape recorder to the courthouse and record the commissioners' crude commentary on the films, which include remarks that Flavel provided the pornography.\n\nAfter the Festival is cancelled, Wendy agrees to a date with Gebhardt at a classy restaurant. Wendy arrives in a deliberately showy, vulgar dress with her breasts artificially inflated by a secret container of fake vomit. Throughout dinner, she constantly shouts out Commissioner Gebhardt's name, his upcoming re-election, and her own age, alerting the other patrons to the situation. Once she has the attention of the entire restaurant, she announces that Gebhardt took her [[virginity]] and that she is now carrying his child. Finally, to complete Gebhardt's humiliation, she uses the fake vomit to pretend to throw up in a fountain. When Gebhardt tries to sneak away, Peewee jumps out with a camera, promising to send the photos to the local newspapers.\n\nThe students lure the Klansmen (who are on their way to Flavel's celebratory revival meeting) into the school gym, whose bleachers are filled to capacity with Seminoles. The students hold down the Klansmen while their Jewish friend, Brian, shaves their heads with an [[wikt:izmel|izmel]]. The Angel Beach students and the Seminoles then strip the Klansmen naked and force them to run across the stage of Flavel's revival. In the confusion, the students commandeer the public address system and play the recording from the courthouse basement. The outraged crowd turns on Flavel, the county commissioners, and the Klan. A closing montage of newspapers report Gebhardt resigns, Flavel is ousted from his position, the county commissioners face obscenity charges, and the Festival resumes.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Dan Monahan]] as Edward \"Pee Wee\" Morris\n* [[Wyatt Knight]] as Tommy Turner\n* [[Mark Herrier]] as Billy McCarty\n* [[Tony Ganios]] as Anthony \"Meat\" Tuperello\n* [[Scott Colomby]] as Brian Schwartz\n* [[Cyril O'Reilly]] as Tim Cavanaugh\n* [[Kaki Hunter]] as Wendy Williams\n* Ilse Earl as Mrs. Morris\n* [[Eric Christmas]] as Mr. Carter\n* Bill Wiley as Bubba Flavel\n* [[Nancy Parsons]] as Ms. Beulah Balbricker\n* [[Joseph Runningfox]] as John Henry\n* [[Roger Wilson (actor)|Roger Wilson]] as Mickey Jarvis\n* [[Art Hindle]] as Officer Ted Jarvis\n* [[Jack Mulcahy (actor)|Jack Mulcahy]] as Frank Bell\n* [[Bill Hindman]] as Coach Goodenough\n* Mal Jones as Mayor Abernathy\n* [[Richard Liberty]] as Commissioner Couch\n* Fred Buch as Commissioner Hurley\n* [[Edward Winter (actor)|Edward Winter]] as Commissioner Bob Gebhardt\n* Will Knickerbocker as Klan #1\n}}\n\n==Production==\n[[Greynolds Park]] in [[North Miami Beach, Florida]] stood in for the Everglades and a plant nursery on [[Old Cutler Road]] was turned into a cemetery for the graveyard scenes.<ref>{{cite news |first=Ily |last=Goyanes |newspaper=[[Miami New Times]] |title=Celluloid City: Porky's Trilogy Filmed at Miami Senior High School and Greynolds Park |url=http://blogs.miaminewtimes.com/cultist/2010/08/celluloid_city_porkys_trilogy.php |date=August 19, 2010 |accessdate=December 12, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100828184235/http://blogs.miaminewtimes.com/cultist/2010/08/celluloid_city_porkys_trilogy.php |archivedate=August 28, 2010 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nCowriter Swaybill later said \"It took us about six weeks to write the sequel.
