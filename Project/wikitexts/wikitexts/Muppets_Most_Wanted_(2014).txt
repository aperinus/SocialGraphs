The film was not as successful as its predecessor, grossing $80.4 million worldwide on a budget of $51 million. It received positive reviews from critics who praised its humor, music and emotion. The film was dedicated to Muppets performer [[Jerry Nelson]], who died during the film's development, and [[Jane Henson]], who died two months into production.\n\n==Plot==\n<!--Per [[WP:FILMPLOT, plots are 400 to 700 words only-->\n[[The Muppets (film)|Directly after the previous film]], the [[The Muppets|Muppets]] find themselves at a loss as to what to do until a man named Dominic Badguy suggests the Muppets go on a European tour with him as their tour manager. Unbeknownst to the Muppets, criminal mastermind [[Constantine (Muppet)|Constantine]], who resembles [[Kermit the Frog|Kermit]], escapes from a [[Gulag|Siberian Gulag]] to join Dominic in a plot to steal the [[Crown Jewels of the United Kingdom|British Crown Jewels]].\n\nIn [[Berlin]], Dominic secures the Muppets a show at a prestigious venue. Frustrated with the group's incessant requests and [[Miss Piggy]]'s insistence they marry, Kermit takes a walk at Dominic's suggestion. Constantine ambushes him, glues a stick-on mole to Kermit's face, and slips away. Mistaken for Constantine, Kermit is arrested and sent to the Gulag.\n\nReplacing, Constantine's blunders in imitating him are covered by Dominic, much to [[Animal (Muppet)|Animal]]'s suspicion, but the other Muppets fall for it. After the Berlin [[The Muppet Show|show]] opens with Constantine freezing in front of the audience, [[Scooter (Muppet)|Scooter]] has to take over. Constantine and Dominic steal paintings from a museum during the show.\n\nThe next morning, [[Interpol]] agent Jean Pierre Napoleon and [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] agent [[Sam Eagle]] grudgingly team up to apprehend the culprit whom Napoleon believes to be his nemesis \"The Lemur\" - the number-two criminal in the world.\n\nMeanwhile, Kermit attempts several escapes from the Gulag but is thwarted each time by [[Prison officer|warden]] Nadya, who is as infatuated with him as Piggy is. Thus uncaring that the real Constantine is free, Nadya orders Kermit to help organize The Siberian Gulag Revue, the prisoners' annual talent show.\n\nFollowing hidden instructions on the stolen painting, Constantine and Dominic divert the tour to [[Madrid]]. Constantine allows the Muppets to perform whatever they wish, leaving [[Walter (Muppet)|Walter]] confused. During this show, Constantine and Dominic break into [[Museo del Prado|a museum]] and destroy a roomful of busts to find a key needed for their plan. Even though the performance is a disaster, the Muppets receive critical acclaim. Sam and Napoleon deduce that the connection between the crimes is the Muppet tour, and the pair interrogates the Muppets, only for Constantine to evade the pair and the others to be found too ill-equipped to be guilty. The instructions on the stolen key lead Constantine and Dominic to schedule the next show in order to rob the [[Bank of Ireland]] in [[Dublin]].\n\nIn Dublin, Walter discovers that Dominic has been giving away show tickets and [[Bribery|bribing]] critics to ensure a packed house and rave reviews, while [[Fozzie Bear|Fozzie]] notices Kermit's and Constantine's similarities. Constantine attacks Walter and Fozzie for their discoveries, but Animal stops him and the three escape to rescue Kermit. During the performance, Dominic steals a locket from the bank and Constantine proposes to Piggy onstage; Piggy accepts, and the pair plan a wedding ceremony to be held at the [[Tower of London]] in [[London]], where the Crown Jewels are kept.\n\nFozzie, Walter and Animal reach the Siberian Gulag on the night of the performance, and Kermit uses it as a front to allow them, himself, and all the prisoners to escape the Gulag.\n\nKermit, Fozzie, Walter and Animal infiltrate Constantine's dressing room and overhear him explain to Dominic that he plans to kill Piggy after they are married. Kermit and Fozzie are briefly detained by Sam, but escape as the wedding begins, and Dominic, with the help of Bobby Benson's Baby Band, manages to steal the jewels. Kermit interrupts the ceremony, revealing Constantine's ruse, and Piggy's ring\u2014actually a bomb\u2014is removed with [[Bunsen Honeydew|Bunsen's]] magnetic bomb attractor vest, worn by [[Beaker (Muppet)|Beaker]].\n\nConstantine takes Piggy [[hostage]] and flees to a helicopter, where he is intercepted by Dominic, who is actually the Lemur and intends to double-cross him. Constantine, after berating Dominic for bragging about the double-cross before escaping, ejects him from the helicopter and tries to take off with Piggy, but Kermit jumps aboard and the rest of the Muppets climb atop each other to stop the escape. Kermit and Piggy incapacitate Constantine, who is arrested with Dominic by Sam and Napoleon. Nadya then arrives in London to recapture Kermit for escaping, but Walter, Fozzie, Gonzo, [[Rowlf the Dog|Rowlf]], Scooter, and Piggy tell her that if she arrests him, then she will have to take them as well. She relents, allowing Kermit to go free.\n\nThe Muppets place their next venue at the Gulag in their finale.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Ricky Gervais]] as Dominic Badguy/The Lemur, the world's second most wanted criminal and Constantine's accomplice who poses as the manager of a fictional international talent agency.<ref name=THR1/> His last name is pronounced \"badjee\" which he describes as a French pronunciation.\n* [[Ty Burrell]] as Jean Pierre Napoleon, a French [[Interpol]] agent who works with [[Sam Eagle]] on finding Constantine.<ref name=THR1/>\n* [[Tina Fey]] as Nadya, a high-ranking [[Prison officer|prison guard]] at Gulag 38B who is obsessed with [[Kermit the Frog]].
