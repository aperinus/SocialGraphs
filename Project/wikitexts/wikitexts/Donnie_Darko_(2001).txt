It stars [[Jake Gyllenhaal]], [[Jena Malone]], [[Maggie Gyllenhaal]], [[Drew Barrymore]], [[Mary McDonnell]], [[Katharine Ross]], [[Patrick Swayze]], [[Noah Wyle]], [[Stu Stone]], [[Daveigh Chase]], [[James Duval]], and [[Seth Rogen]]. Set in October 1988, the film follows Donnie Darko, an emotionally troubled teenager who inadvertently escapes a bizarre accident by [[sleepwalking]]. He has visions of Frank, a mysterious figure in a rabbit costume who informs him that the world will end in just over 28 days. Frank begins to manipulate Donnie to commit several crimes.\n\nDevelopment began in late 1997 when Kelly had graduated from film school and started writing scripts. He took an early idea of a jet engine falling onto a house with no one knowing its origin and built the story around it. Kelly insisted on directing the film himself and struggled to secure backing from producers until 2000, when Barrymore's [[Flower Films]] agreed to produce it on a $4.5 million budget. Filming took 28 days in the summer of 2000, mostly in California. The soundtrack features a cover of \"[[Mad World]]\" by [[Tears for Fears]] by American musicians [[Gary Jules]] and [[Michael Andrews (musician)|Michael Andrews]], which went to No. 1 on the [[UK Singles Chart]] for three weeks.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/news/music/gary-jules-3-1373002|title=IT'S A MAD, MAD, MAD WORLD!|date=January 4, 2004|work=[[NME]]}}</ref>\n\nThe film premiered on January 19, 2001 at the [[Sundance Film Festival]], followed by a limited theatrical release on October 26. Because the film's advertising featured a crashing plane and the [[September 11 attacks]] had occurred a month and a half before, it was scarcely advertised, which affected its box office performance; it grossed just $517,375 in its initial run.<ref name=\"numbers\" /> ''Donnie Darko'' received positive reviews and was listed No.&nbsp;2 in ''[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]''{{'}}s \"50 Greatest Independent Films of All Time\",<ref name=\"empireonline.com\">{{cite web|url=https://www.empireonline.com/features/50greatestindependent/2.asp|archive-date=April 28, 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060428063009/http://www.empireonline.com/features/50greatestindependent/2.asp|url-status=dead|title=50 Greatest Independent Films of All Time|access-date=2012-09-30}}</ref> and No.&nbsp;53 in ''Empire''{{'}}s \"500 Greatest Movies of All Time\".<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite web|url=https://www.empireonline.com/500/88.asp|title=Empire's 500 Greatest Movies Of All Time|access-date=2012-09-30|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121015071257/http://www.empireonline.com/500/88.asp|archive-date=October 15, 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref> After reissues, it went on to gross $7.5 million worldwide.

Darko]]'', followed in 2009 without Kelly's involvement. In 2021, he announced that work on a new sequel is in progress.\n\n==Plot==\nOn October 2, 1988, troubled teenager Donald \"Donnie\" Darko sleepwalks outside, led by a mysterious voice. Once outside, he meets a figure in a monstrous rabbit costume who introduces himself as \"Frank\" and tells Donnie that the world will end in precisely 28 days, 6 hours, 42 minutes and 12 seconds. Donnie wakes up the next morning on the green of a local golf course and returns home to discover a [[jet engine]] has crashed into his bedroom. His older sister Elizabeth tells him the [[Federal Aviation Administration|FAA]] investigators do not know its origin.\n\nOver the next several days, Donnie continues to have visions of Frank, and his parents Eddie and Rose send him to [[psychotherapist]] Dr. Thurman. Thurman believes Donnie is detached from reality, and that his visions of Frank are \"[[hallucination|daylight hallucinations]],\" symptomatic of [[paranoid schizophrenia]]. Frank asks Donnie if he believes in [[time travel]], who, in turn, asks his science teacher Dr. Kenneth Monnitoff. Monnitoff gives Donnie ''The Philosophy of Time Travel'', a book written by Roberta Sparrow, a former science teacher at the school who is now a seemingly senile old woman living outside of town. Donnie also starts seeing Gretchen Ross, who has recently moved into town with her mother under a new identity to escape her violent stepfather.\n\nFrank begins to influence Donnie's actions through his sleepwalking episodes, including causing him to flood his high school by breaking a water main. Gym teacher Kitty Farmer attributes the act of vandalism to the influence of the short story \"[[The Destructors]]\", assigned by dedicated English teacher Karen Pomeroy. Kitty begins teaching \u201cattitude lessons\u201d taken from local [[motivational speaker]] Jim Cunningham, but Donnie rebels against these, leading to friction between Kitty and Rose. Kitty arranges for Cunningham to speak at a school assembly, where Donnie insults him. He later finds Cunningham's wallet and address, and Frank suggests setting his house on fire. Firefighters discover a hoard of [[child pornography]] there. Cunningham is arrested, and Kitty, who wishes to testify in his defense, asks Rose to chaperone their daughters' dance troupe on its trip to Los Angeles.\n\nWith Rose in Los Angeles and Eddie away for business, Donnie and Elizabeth hold a [[Halloween]] costume party to celebrate Elizabeth's acceptance to [[Harvard University|Harvard]]. At the party, Gretchen arrives distraught as her mother has gone missing, and she and Donnie make love for the first time. When Donnie realizes that Frank's [[Prophecy|prophesied]] end of the world is only hours away, he takes Gretchen and two other friends to see Sparrow. Instead of Sparrow, they find two high school bullies, Seth and Ricky, who were trying to rob Sparrow's home. Donnie, Seth, and Ricky get into a fight in the road in front of her house, just as Sparrow was returning home. An oncoming car swerves to avoid Sparrow and runs over Gretchen, killing her. The driver turns out to be Elizabeth's boyfriend, Frank Anderson, wearing the same rabbit costume from Donnie's visions. Donnie shoots Frank in the eye with his father's gun, and walks home carrying Gretchen's body.\n\nDonnie returns home as a vortex forms over his house. He borrows one of his parents' cars, loads Gretchen's body into it, and drives to a nearby ridge that overlooks town. There, he watches as the plane carrying Rose and the dance troupe home from Los Angeles gets caught in the vortex's wake, which violently rips off one of its engines, and sends it back in time. Events of the previous 28 days unwind. Donnie wakes up in his bedroom, recognizes the date is October 2, and laughs as the jet engine falls into his bedroom, crushing him. Around town, those whose lives Donnie would have touched wake up from troubled dreams. Gretchen rides by the Darko home the next morning, and learns of Donnie's death. Gretchen and Rose exchange glances and wave as if they know each other, but cannot remember where.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Jake Gyllenhaal]] as Donnie Darko\n* Holmes Osborne as Eddie Darko\n* [[Maggie Gyllenhaal]] as Elizabeth Darko\n* [[Daveigh Chase]] as Samantha Darko\n* [[Mary McDonnell]] as Rose Darko\n* [[James Duval]] as Frank The Rabbit/Frank Anderson\n* [[Arthur Taxier]] as Dr. Tad Fisher \n* [[Patrick Swayze]] as Jim Cunningham \n* [[David St. James]] as Bob Garland\n* Jazzie Mahannah as Joanie James \n* [[Seth Rogen]] as Ricky Danforth\n* [[Jolene Purdy]] as Cherita Chen\n* [[Stuart Stone]] as Ronald Fisher\n* Gary Lundy as Sean Smith\n* [[Alex Greenwald]] as Seth Devlin\n* [[Beth Grant]] as Kitty Farmer\n* [[Jena Malone]] as Gretchen Ross\n* David Moreland as Principal Cole\n* [[Noah Wyle]] as Prof. Kenneth Monnitoff\n* [[Drew Barrymore]] as Karen Pomeroy\n* Kristina Malota as Susie Bates\n* Marina Malota as Emily Bates\n* Carly Naples as Suzy Bailey\n* [[Tiler Peck]] as Beth Farmer\n* [[Patience Cleveland]] as Roberta Sparrow (\"Grandma Death\")\n* [[Katharine Ross]] as Dr. Lillian Thurman\n* [[Lisa K.

If the Artifact is not sent to the Primary Universe by the chosen Living Receiver (Donnie) within 28 days, the Primary Universe will be destroyed upon the collapse of the Tangent in a [[black hole]]. To aid in this task, the Living Receiver is given super-human abilities such as foresight, physical strength and elemental powers, but at the cost of troubling visions and paranoia, while the Manipulated Living (all who live around the Receiver) support him in unnatural ways, setting up a [[domino effect|domino-like chain of events]] encouraging him to return the Artifact. The Manipulated Dead (those who die within the Tangent Universe, like Frank and Gretchen) are more aware than the Living, having the power to travel through time, and will set an Ensurance Trap, a scenario which leaves the Receiver no choice but to save the Primary Universe.<ref name=Everything>{{cite news | url =http://www.salon.com/2004/07/23/darko/ | title = Everything you were afraid to ask about \"Donnie Darko\" | first = Dan | last = Kois | date = 2004-07-23 | access-date = 2013-06-19 | work = [[Salon (website)|Salon]]}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n===Critical reception===\nThe [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reported that 86% of critics gave the film a positive review based on 118 reviews, with an average rating of 7.60/10.
