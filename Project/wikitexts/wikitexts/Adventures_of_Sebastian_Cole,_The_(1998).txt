Sebastian's sister, Jessica, leaves immediately for [[California]], and his mother, Joan, takes him back to [[England]]. Eight months later, Sebastian is back in the United States, knocking on his stepmother's door. Now named Henrietta, she takes Sebastian in and supports him over the next few months of high school. Sebastian's \"adventures\" are mostly self-destructive.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Adrian Grenier]] as Sebastian Cole\n* [[Clark Gregg]] as Hank/Henrietta Rossi\n* [[Aleksa Palladino]] as Mary\n* [[Margaret Colin]] as Joan Cole\n* [[John Shea]] as Hartley\n* Marni Lustig as Jessica Cole\n* [[Joan Copeland]] as Grandma Cole\n* Tom Lacy as Grandpa Cole\n* [[Gabriel Macht]] as Troy\n* Russel Harper as Wayne\n* [[Rory Cochrane]] as Chinatown\n* [[Famke Janssen]] as Fiona\n* [[Nicole Ari Parker]] as Nurse Jenny\n* Marisol Padilla S\u00e1nchez as Woman in Desert\n* [[Levon Helm]] as Bob\n\n==Reception==\nOn [[Rotten Tomatoes]] the film has an approval rating of 46% based on reviews from 24 critics, with an average rating of 5.8/10.<ref>{{rotten-tomatoes|adventures_of_sebastian_cole|The Adventures of Sebastian Cole}}</ref>\n\n[[Roger Ebert]] gave the film three out of four stars, noting that the film avoids easy cliche in favour of a more thoughtful approach to the subject matter. He gave particular praise to Clark Gregg saying that, whilst one is never in doubt about his gender because of his physical appearance, \"in his heart he knows he is a woman, and he is true to that inner conviction with a courage that the film doesn't need to underline, because it permeates the performance\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/the-adventures-of-sebastian-cole-1999 |title=The Adventures of Sebastian Cole |author=Roger Ebert |date=1999-08-20 |website=rogerebert.com |access-date=2016-06-22 }}</ref> Stephen Holden of ''[[The New York Times]]'' praised Adrian Greiner's performance feeling that it \"beautifully captures his character's precarious balance of naivete and bravado, self-destructiveness and self-invention\".<ref>{{cite news |last=Holden |first=Stephen |date=1999-08-06 |title='The Adventures of Sebastian Cole': When a Boy's Stepdad Is the Best Mother of All |url=https://partners.nytimes.com/library/film/080699cole-film-review.html |newspaper=New York Times |access-date=2016-06-22 }}</ref>\n\nWriting in ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'', [[Joe Leydon]] believed that the scenes between Gregg and Grenier were the strongest (although he felt that Gregg's portrayal came close to caricature). He was critical of the technical aspects of the film's production, felt that other films had covered similar ground better and that the ending was poorly conceived and too abrupt. He predicted that the film would perform poorly with critics and at the box office.<ref>{{cite news |last=Leydon |first=Joe |date=1999-09-18 |title=Review: 'The Adventures of Sebastian Cole' |url=https://variety.com/1998/film/reviews/the-adventures-of-sebastian-cole-1200455121/ |newspaper=Variety |access-date=2016-06-22 }}</ref> ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'''s Owen Gleiberman gave the film a \"B\" rating, adding that he wished it had been better structured, although the current configuration was \"integral\" to its \"charm\".<ref>{{cite news |last=Gleiberman |first=Owen |author-link=Owen Gleiberman |date=1999-08-13 |title=The Adventures of Sebastian Cole |url=http://www.ew.com/article/1999/08/13/movie-review-adventures-sebastian-cole |newspaper=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |access-date=2016-06-22 }}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of American films of 1998]]\n* [[Transgender in film and television]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|0168449|The Adventures of Sebastian Cole}}\n* {{allrovi movie|173450|The Adventures of Sebastian Cole}}\n* {{mojo title|adventuresofsebastiancole|The Adventures of Sebastian Cole}}\n\n{{Kip Williams}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Adventures Of Sebastian Cole}}\n[[Category:1998 films]]\n[[Category:1990s coming-of-age comedy-drama films]]\n[[Category:1998 LGBT-related films]]\n[[Category:American coming-of-age comedy-drama films]]\n[[Category:American LGBT-related films]]\n[[Category:American teen comedy-drama films]]\n[[Category:1990s English-language films]]\n[[Category:Films about dysfunctional families]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Tod Williams]]\n[[Category:Films set in the 1980s]]\n[[Category:Films set in 1983]]\n[[Category:Films set in New York (state)]]\n[[Category:Films set in New York City]]\n[[Category:Films shot in New York (state)]]\n[[Category:American independent films]]\n[[Category:Paramount Vantage films]]\n[[Category:Films about trans women]]\n[[Category:1998 independent films]]\n[[Category:1990s teen comedy-drama films]]\n[[Category:LGBT-related coming-of-age films]]\n[[Category:1990s American films]]"}]}}}}
