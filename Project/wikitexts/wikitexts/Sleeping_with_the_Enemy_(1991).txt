The film is based on Nancy Price's 1987 [[Sleeping with the Enemy (novel)|novel of the same name]].<ref name=\"Nancy Price\"/> Roberts plays a woman who fakes her own death and moves to escape from her controlling abusive husband, but finds her peaceful new life interrupted when he discovers her actions and tracks her down from [[Cape Cod]] to [[Cedar Falls, Iowa]].\n\n''Sleeping with the Enemy'' was released theatrically on February 8, 1991, where it received negative reviews from the critics, but was a box office success, grossing $175 million on a production budget of $19 million. The film also broke the record at the time for the highest domestic opening for a film with a female lead, grossing $13 million on its opening weekend surpassing the previous record held by ''[[Alien (film)|Alien]]'', which grossed $10 million in its first weekend.\n\n==Plot==\nLaura Burney has a seemingly idyllic life and perfect marriage to Martin, a successful Boston investment counselor. Beneath Martin's charming, handsome exterior, however, is an obsessive and controlling personality who has [[Physical abuse|physically]], [[Psychological abuse|emotionally]], and [[Marital rape|sexually]] [[Intimate partner violence|abused]] Laura throughout their nearly four-year marriage. Then, in a recurring pattern, he apologetically showers her with flowers and gifts.\n\nMartin accepts the invitation of their neighbor, a doctor, for an evening sail, despite knowing Laura fears water. As a severe storm unexpectedly rolls in, Martin and the doctor struggle to control the vessel. Laura, unable to swim, is swept overboard. After an extensive Coast Guard search, Laura is presumed dead from drowning and Martin is inconsolable.\n\nAfter some time, Laura is actually alive. After secretly learning to swim, she planned to fake her own death to escape Martin's abuse. During the storm, she jumped overboard, swam ashore, and returned home. She cut her hair, donned a wig, took her stashed belongings and money, and headed to the bus station.\n\nLaura moves to [[Cedar Falls, Iowa]]. Previously, she told Martin that her [[Visual impairment|blind]], stroke-impaired mother, Chloe, died, but secretly moved Chloe to an Iowa nursing home. She rents a house, finds a job, and settles into a new life as \"Sara Waters\". Her friendly next-door neighbor, Ben Woodward, a young drama teacher at a local college, is attracted to Laura, though he suspects she has a troubled past. They have a fun date, but when a kiss turns more physical, Laura resists and demands that Ben leave. She later confides to him that she escaped an abusive marriage.\n\nMartin receives information indicating Laura may be alive. This is confirmed when he finds Laura's wedding ring, where she had flushed it down the toilet but it had failed to flush. He travels to Chloe's nursing home, posing as a detective, and learns that Chloe's \"nephew\" has just visited. Laura, disguised as a man, is also at the nursing home, and barely misses encountering Martin. Martin discovers Laura's whereabouts and learns about Ben. He trails the couple to Laura's house and breaks in while she and Ben are outside. Laura notices the small clues Martin deliberately left inside the house, the hand towels being perfectly aligned and the contents of the kitchen cabinets rearranged to Martin's exact standards.\n\nMartin confronts Laura and Ben breaks down the door and struggles with Martin, who knocks him unconscious. As he aims a gun at Ben, Laura distracts him, then knees his groin. She grabs Martin's gun and holds him at gunpoint. As Laura calls the police, Martin expects her to tell the police to protect her from him, as she had done in the past, but Laura shocks Martin by informing the police she killed an intruder, and then shoots Martin three times. Wounded from the shots, Martin seizes Laura by the hair and grabs the gun, aiming it at her in a desperate attempt to kill her, but his attempt fails, as the gun turns out to be empty. Martin then dies from his wounds, while Laura and Ben embrace and wait for the police.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Julia Roberts]] as Laura Williams Burney / Sara Waters\n* [[Patrick Bergin]] as Martin Burney\n* [[Kevin Anderson (actor)|Kevin Anderson]] as Ben Woodward\n* [[Elizabeth Lawrence (actress)|Elizabeth Lawrence]] as Chloe Williams \n* Harley Venton\tas Garber\n* Sandi Shackelford as Edna\n* Bonnie Johnson as Mrs. Neppert\n\n==Release==\n===Critical reception===\n{{asof|September 2022}}, the film held a 19% \"Rotten\" rating based on 36 reviews on [[Rotten Tomatoes]].
