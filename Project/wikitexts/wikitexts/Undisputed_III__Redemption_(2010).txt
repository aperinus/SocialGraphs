The third installment in the franchise started by the 2002 action film ''[[Undisputed (film)|Undisputed]]'', it takes place several years after the events of ''[[Undisputed II: Last Man Standing]]''.\n\n==Plot==\n{{Long plot|section|date=November 2020}}<!-- Word count: 1048 as of 1 Nov 2020 --><!-- Word count should be 400-700 per [[WP:FILMPLOT]] -->\nYears have passed since Yuri Boyka suffered a defeat and a broken knee at the hands of George \"Iceman\" Chambers. Humbled by his injury, he has relegated to becoming the prison janitor. Meanwhile, mob boss Gaga has expanded his prison tournament enterprise into an inter-prison tournament called the Prison Spetz Competition (PSC), which gathers the best prison fighters from around the globe to compete for a chance at a cleared record and early release. As Boyka hears the preliminaries taking place within the prison, as well as failing in his parole, he begins training privately to bring his knee back into fighting shape. Just after current champion Vladimir Sykov defeats his opponent in the final round of the prison's tournament, Boyka challenges him on the spot and swiftly defeats him, thus becoming the Russian representative for the PSC.\n\nBoyka is transferred to Gorgon prison in the [[Georgia (country)|Republic of Georgia]] where he is joined by a diverse group of eight international prison fighters. Though the fighters are allowed one hour each day for training, they are still grouped into the general population for hard labor while Colombian fighter and local inmate Raul \"Dolor\" Qui\u00f1ones is given private sparring sessions and a regimen of performance-enhancing drugs. During his stay, Boyka gets into odds with an American fighter Jericho \"Turbo\" Jones who is shown to be disrespectful, insubordinate, and a loudmouth. Boyka, Turbo, Dolor, and Brazilian fighter Rodrigo Silva advance to the second round of the tournament while the losing fighters are sent home, only to be shot dead by waiting guards.\n\nThe next day, Turbo starts a fight with Boyka before both men are thrown into solitary confinement. They are eventually released due to some manipulations by their managers Gaga and mafia don Gio Farnatti, who are old friends and rivals. Upon hearing of the prison's treatment of their fighters, the two mob bosses confront Warden Kuss, but PSC mastermind Rezo explains to them that the tournament has always been fixed to ensure the \"highest profit at the lowest risk\". He advises them to liquefy their assets and place their bets on Dolor to ensure their profit. Realizing that the loyalty to their fighters only extend to their payout, Gaga and Farnatti agree to this arrangement. Meanwhile, Boyka and Turbo slowly develop a trust in each other and focus their attention at beating Dolor in the tournament. They both start using the hard labor as part of their training. With Turbo's attitude eroding, he starts showing signs that his ego evolved from a highly disciplined past as a U.S. Marine. In addition to reciting, \"[[Culture of the United States Marine Corps|Improvise, Adapt, Overcome]]\" as part of his training, he recommends some holistic medicine for Boyka to soothe his knee.\n\nIn the semi-finals, Boyka defeats Silva by making him tap out to a [[triangle choke]]; he helps his opponent up and commends him for a good fight. Realizing that Boyka and Turbo are stronger than predicted, Rezo and Warden Kuss arrange to have the guards beat up Turbo to a bloody pulp. When the prisoners are taken for the next round of hard labor, Boyka tries to convince Turbo into escaping rather than face Dolor wounded. Knowing that Turbo used to be in the military, the plan is to escape to the forest where the security is lightest and survive long enough to eventually get in touch with the black market. Turbo initially disagrees, until another prisoner reveals that the losers are executed. Caught trying to break their chain, the two fight off the guards long enough to get a key. Freed, Turbo makes a run for the forest.\n\nBoyka is returned to the prison where he is confronted by Rezo, Warden Kuss, and Gaga. Knowing he has lost all support, he commits himself to ruining their wagers by defeating Dolor in the newly improvised final round. Dolor takes an early lead with his exceptionally quick hand blocks and strikes, as well as exacerbating the problems with Boyka's weak knee by using a submission hold on it. Deprived of his kicking ability and agility, Boyka recovers first by relying on his endurance and pain tolerance, persevering past some devastating hits. It looks like the fight is over when he is kicked out of the ring, but when he catches a glimpse of the mop and bucket used for sopping up blood after the bouts, which bears a striking resemblance to the ones he used during his training, he returns into the ring before the ten-count. Remembering Turbo's mantra, \"Improvise, Adapt, Overcome,\" he takes the blood-soaked pad off the mop and ties it around his knee. Forced to adapt, he begins using a new style mixing in elements of grappling, dirty boxing [[Headbutt|head-butts]] and elbows, [[wrestling]], and [[Chinese martial arts|wu-shu]]. Dolor, in a final moment of rage, breaks his shin against Boyka's knee block, ending the match.\n\nDesperate and despondent, Farnatti confronts Warden Kuss and shoots Rezo over the money that he's lost before being shot by the warden himself. Despite winning the tournament, Boyka is not allowed to go free because the guards have not found Turbo. Because Boyka was responsible for his escape, the arrangement is that Turbo will remain free while Boyka will be transferred back to his original prison, to which Boyka responds that he does not care \u2014 he has proven his point. Like the other prisoners, Boyka is instead taken out to be shot, but he is rescued at the last minute by Turbo. The duo retreat to a waiting car where Gaga sits with a suitcase of money. He reveals that he always knew Boyka was the best fighter in the world, especially when he was angry, so he bet all of his money on him all along and deceived the other managers \u2014 even going so far as to rescue and hide Turbo when he escaped. Boyka decides to part ways, finally revealing his first name, Yuri, to Turbo. In turn, Turbo confesses that his real name is \"Jericho,\" not realizing that Boyka has a special appreciation for religious references. In gratitude, he thanks Turbo for \"bringing down the walls\" and setting him free. Turbo then requests a match with Boyka in future and Boyka accepts. As the car leaves, Boyka happily walks with the money filled briefcase toward freedom laughing joyfully.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Scott Adkins]] as Yuri Boyka, Russian fighter and protagonist\n* [[Mykel Shannon Jenkins]] as Jericho \"Turbo\" Jones, the hot-headed American fighter\n* [[Mark Ivanir]] as Gaga, Russian Mafia boss and he represents Boyka\n* [[Hristo Shopov]] as Kuss, Warden of the Gorgon Prison in [[Tbilisi]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]\n* [[Robert Costanzo]] as Gio Farnatti, [[Italian American]] Mafia boss and he represents \"Turbo\"\n* [[Marko Zaror]] as Raul \"Dolor\" Qui\u00f1ones, Colombian fighter and enforcer of Cali Cartel\n* [[Vernon Dobtcheff]] as Rezo, Georgian Mafia boss and he represents \"Dolor\"\n* Velislav Pavlov as Chief Guard\n* Nikolai Sotirov as Announcer\n* Esteban Cueto as Vladimir Sykov, the dominant fighter at the prison Boyka was being held at, would have become the Russian competitor if Boyka did not challenge him.\n* Plamen Manasiyev as Lead Parole Board Manager\n* [[Valentin Ganev]] as Markov, Warden of the Chornya Cholmni Prison in [[Russia]]\n* Stefan Shterev as Sports Book Clerk\n* Dimo Dimov as Gaga's Bodyguard\n* Yordan Zahariev as Referee #1\n* Pavel Doichev as Referee #2\n* [[Lateef Crowder]] as Rodrigo Silva, Brazilian fighter who uses capoeira.\n* Ilram Choi as Chai Lam, North Korean fighter who uses taekwondo, he is easily eliminated by Dolor\n* Anton Trendafilov as Old Waterman\n* Ivan Zaharov as Musician #1\n* Nikolay Petrov as Musician #2\n* Kiril Efremov as Guard #1\n* Michael Baral as Casino Manager\n* Vladimir Bonev as Businessman (uncredited)\n* Dimitar Doichinov as Andrei Kraitz (uncredited), Croatian fighter who is defeated by Turbo\n* [[Borislav Iliev]] as Prison Guard #1 (uncredited)\n* Trayan Milenov-Troy as Jean Dupont (uncredited), French fighter who is defeated by Boyka\n* Radoslav Parvanov as Petros Mavros (uncredited), Greek fighter who is defeated by Silva\n* Velizar Peev as Prison Guard #2 (uncredited)\n}}\n\n==Release==\n===Theatrical===\nIt was released in the United States on June 1, 2010.\n\n==Reception==\n===Box office===\nThe film grossed $282,548 in Lebanon and United Arab Emirates.<ref name=\"mojo\">{{cite web |url=https://boxofficemojo.com/movies/intl/?page=&view=bycountry&id=_fUNDISPUTEDIIIRED01 |title=Undisputed III: Redemption |website=[[Box Office Mojo]] |publisher=[[Internet Movie Database]] |access-date=July 6, 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Critical response===\nJames Marsh of ''[[Screen Anarchy]]'' praised Florentine's direction for capturing the \"flow and [the] combinations\" of the \"innovative, exciting and technically groundbreaking battles\" and his cast of charismatic action stars, singling out Zaror for having \"a natural eye-catching screen quality that's hard to ignore\", concluding that: \"[A]s someone who normally demands genuine drama from real characters along with his martial arts, I was overpowered, overwhelmed and left battered and bleeding at the total mercy of this movie.

On May 29, 2014, When asked whether there would be an ''Undisputed 4'', Adkins replied, \"Yes, it is definitely something we are pursuing. We are working on the script at the moment trying to get all the departments happy with what we are trying to do. It\u2019s taking longer than I want to be honest but you know it is difficult financing these films. In this day and age those type of straight to DVD films don\u2019t make the sort of money they used to make in the 90s/early 2000s. So it is a bit of a precarious business at the moment and that is why it is taking so long but we are definitely all trying to get it going because we appreciate what following that character of Boyka has and you know, I love playing that character and I can\u2019t wait to return to him and we\u2019ve got some good ideas on where to take the character.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.moviecricket.com/exclusive-scott-adkins-confirms-boyka-undisputed-4-90605/ |title=Exclusive!
