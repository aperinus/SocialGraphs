Chloe, her husband Robbie, and their two children, Nicky and Leah, welcome their visitors. Outside the house, Paulie vomits near the bushes, which his mother believes is due to being [[motion sickness|carsick]].\n\nAs the night progresses, Nicky and Leah also begin to show symptoms of an illness. Leah coughs up some black bile, which is shown magnified on her pillow, where strange forms of bacteria is proliferating exponentially. As everyone goes to bed, the family cat, Jinxie, goes missing. Casey, back at the woods, calls her friend and makes plans to escape and attend a party, but she's startled by Jinxie snarling. However, she is unable to find the cat. By the next day, all of the children have become seemingly pale and infected. Casey phones her friend who promises to meet her at 2 p.m. The children and men are playing in the snow, and one of the children has Jinxie's collar in the play tent. Whilst Jonah and Robbie are having a discussion about [[Traditional Chinese medicine|TCM]], Paulie shoves a [[sled]] downhill that hits Chloe's ankle, causing her to drop tea all over Jonah, scalding him. Jonah is angry enough to spank Paulie. Robbie goes for a smoke break in the greenhouse, and Casey joins him. He sees her tattoo and asks about it. It is a [[fetus]], the [[umbilical cord|umbilical]] cord connected to her [[belly button]], as represents \"the abortion that got away\" Casey herself. Chloe interrupts them soon after. At dinner, Chloe mentions the tattoo, upsetting Elaine and embarrassing Casey. Miranda suddenly has a violent outburst, scratching Chloe and ruining the food. While Jonah tries to deal with Miranda upstairs, Robbie takes the rest of the children outside to play in the snow. As Robbie is sledding downhill, Nicky places a garden rake in the sled's path, which slices open Robbie's head on impact. The children scream, drawing the attention of Casey and the rest of the adults as Robbie bleeds out in the snow. Elaine phones an ambulance, but Robbie quickly dies from his injuries. The children then run off into the forest.\n\nCasey attempts to find the children in the forest, and she finds Leah sobbing and coughing, but then as she gets closer, Leah starts laughing and is holding a knife, cutting into something. Casey, frightened, slips and falls into a puddle of vomit, as she screams. Meanwhile, Jonah tries to call the emergency services, but they are held up by the extremely snowy roads.\n\nPaulie attacks Jonah with a knife, slicing his arm, then runs off before luring Elaine to a climbing frame and breaking her leg. Casey rescues her and they seek refuge in the greenhouse which is attacked by the kids with rocks. Paulie crawls inside and attempts to stab them but is fended off by Casey. Meanwhile, Chloe finds Robbie's body inside the children's play tent where a baby doll is shoved within his cut-open stomach; she is then attacked by Leah. Casey saves her, but Chloe panics, blaming Casey for what is happening before fleeing into the house. Casey returns to the greenhouse and saves Elaine who in turn saves Casey by dragging Paulie's hood, causing him to fall backwards onto a protruding glass shard, killing him. Jonah finds Paulie dead and attempts to hide him from Chloe. The group enter the house where Chloe accuses Casey and Elaine of going insane when Casey says Elaine killed Paulie only in order to save her.\n\nJonah and Chloe abandon them in anger and leave to find the kids. Casey starts barricading the house, after convincing her mother that the kids are attacking them due to their sickness. Meanwhile, Jonah and Chloe are separated in the woods, where Chloe is soon reunited with her kids, but Leah stabs her in the eye with a crayon, killing her. Casey finds Miranda beating Jinxie's corpse in the bedroom and throttles her; Jonah walks in and Miranda manipulates Jonah into believing that Casey attacked them, so Jonah gets Casey off of her and Casey pushes him and he hits her with a toy car and slams Casey into a wall and locks her in the bedroom. When he gets downstairs he drags Elaine roughly back to the couch. Miranda removes the splint Casey made for Elaine's leg, before running to Jonah before they drive off. In the house, as Elaine attempts to drag herself upstairs to free Casey, Leah and Nicky get into the house and Elaine manages to reach the bedroom door that Casey is locked in. Leah and Nicky catch up to Elaine, as tries to use a poker, but is unable to hurt them. They both attempt to cut a wooden doll into her uterus.\n\nCasey escapes the bedroom and kills Nicky and tries to stab Leah at the foot of the stairs, but Elaine begs for her not to. So Casey and Elaine get into a car and start driving and find that the car Jonah was driving has crashed into a tree. Casey told Elaine to stay in the car while she went to check it out. She finds Jonah, dead by Chloe's crashed car. As Casey investigates Jonah's corpse, Miranda tries to attack her with a crowbar. Elaine could not get Casey's attention so she rams Miranda with the car, killing her and saving Casey. They suddenly notice a crowd of various infected kids, including Leah, emerge from the woods. As Elaine had just noticed Casey vomiting in the woods, she's unsure whether to let Casey accompany her. Ultimately, as the children encroach upon them, she's unable to leave Casey behind and they drive off. As Elaine panics, Casey, unresponsive, starts staring into space like the infected children did and the film ends leaving the audience wondering if Casey became infected as well.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Eva Birthistle]] as Elaine\n* [[Stephen Campbell Moore]] as Jonah\n* [[Hannah Tointon]] as Casey\n* Eva Sayer as Miranda\n* William Howes as Paulie\n* [[Rachel Shelley]] as Chloe\n* [[Jeremy Sheffield]] as Robbie\n* [[Rafiella Brookes]] as Leah\n* [[Jake Hathaway]] as Nicky\n}}\n\n==Locations==\nThe film was shot in [[Cookhill Priory]], a former [[Cistercians|Cistercian]] nunnery, and in the nearby villages of [[Cookhill]] and [[Alcester]] in the English counties of [[Worcestershire]] and [[Warwickshire]], respectively.<ref>https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1172571/ {{User-generated source|date=May 2022}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/my-friend-map/3233314103 | title=Tom Shankland, Cookhill Priory, Warwickshire | date=12 February 2008 }}</ref>\n\n==Box office==\nThe film opened at 10th place in the UK, grossing only \u00a398,205 at 132 cinemas.{{citation needed|date=August 2021}} In the weeks after its release, the film dropped to 13th place and then again to 22nd place.<ref>https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1172571/ {{User-generated source|date=May 2022}}</ref>\n\n==Critical response==\nOn [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film has an approval rating of 76% based on reviews from 17 critics.
