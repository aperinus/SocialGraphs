A [[The Man Who Fell to Earth (TV series)|2022 television series with the same name]] serves as a continuation of the film 45 years later, including featuring Newton as a character and showing archival footage from the film.\n\n''The Man Who Fell to Earth'' retains a [[cult following]] for its use of [[surreal cinema|surreal]] imagery and Bowie's first starring film role as the alien Thomas Jerome Newton. It is considered an important work of science fiction cinema and one of the best films of Roeg's career.\n\n== Plot ==\nThomas Jerome Newton is a [[humanoid]] alien who travels to Earth from a distant planet. Landing in [[New Mexico]], he appears as an [[English people|Englishman]]. Newton has arrived on Earth on a mission to take water back to his home planet, which is experiencing a catastrophic drought. Newton swiftly uses the advanced technology of his home planet to patent many inventions on Earth. He acquires tremendous wealth as the head of an [[Arizona]] technology-based conglomerate, World Enterprises Corporation, aided by leading [[patent attorney]] Oliver Farnsworth. This wealth is needed to construct a space vehicle with the intention of shipping water back to his home planet.\n\nWhile revisiting New Mexico, Newton meets Mary-Lou, a lonely young woman from Oklahoma who works an array of part-time jobs in a small town hotel to support herself. Mary-Lou introduces Newton to many customs of Earth, including churchgoing, alcohol, and sex. She and Newton move into a house together which he has built close to where he first landed in New Mexico.\n\nDr. Nathan Bryce, a former womaniser and college professor, has landed a job as a fuel technician with World Enterprises and slowly becomes Newton's confidant. Bryce senses Newton's [[Extraterrestrial life|alienness]] and arranges a meeting with Newton at his home where he has hidden a special [[X-ray]] camera. When he takes a picture of Newton with the camera, it reveals Newton's alien physiology. Newton's appetite for alcohol and television (he is capable of watching multiple televisions at once) becomes crippling, and he and Mary-Lou fight. Realizing that Bryce has learnt his secret, Newton reveals his alien form to Mary-Lou. She struggles to accept his true form. She flees in panic and horror.\n\nNewton completes the spaceship and attempts to take it on its maiden voyage amid intense press exposure. However, just before his scheduled take-off, he is seized and detained, apparently by the government and a rival company. His business partner Farnsworth is murdered. The government, which had been monitoring Newton via his driver, holds Newton captive in a locked luxury apartment, constructed deep within a hotel. During his captivity, they keep him sedated with alcohol (to which he has become addicted) and continuously subject him to rigorous medical tests, cutting into his human disguise. One examination, involving X-rays, causes the [[contact lenses]] he wears as part of his human disguise to permanently affix themselves to his eyes.\n\nToward the end of Newton's years of captivity, he is visited again by Mary-Lou. She is much older, and her appearance has been ravaged by alcohol and time. They have mock-violent, playful sex that involves firing a gun with blanks, and afterwards occupy their time drinking and playing [[table tennis]]. Mary-Lou declares that she no longer loves him, and he replies that he does not love her either. Eventually Newton discovers that his \"prison\", now derelict, is unlocked, and he leaves.\n\nUnable to return home, a despondent and alcoholic Newton creates a recording with alien messages, which he hopes will be broadcast via radio to his home planet. Bryce, who has since married Mary-Lou, buys a copy of the album and meets Newton at a restaurant. Newton is still rich and young-looking despite the passage of many years. However, he has also fallen into depression and continues to suffer from alcoholism. Seated on the restaurant's outdoor patio, Newton inquires about Mary-Lou, before collapsing in a drunken stupor on the chair.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[David Bowie]] as Thomas Jerome Newton\n* [[Rip Torn]] as Dr. Nathan Bryce\n* [[Candy Clark]] as Mary-Lou\n* [[Buck Henry]] as Oliver V.

Bowie recalled in 1992 that \"we got on rather well. I think I was fulfilling what he needed from me for that role. I wasn't disrupting ... I wasn't ''disrupted''. In fact, I was very eager to please. And amazingly enough, I was able to carry out everything I was asked to do. I was ''quite'' willing to stay up as long as anybody.\"<ref name=Movieline92 />\n\nBowie brought a personal library with him; \"I took 400 books down to that film shoot.
