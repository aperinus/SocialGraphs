Siegel]] and [[Todd Hanson (actor)|Todd Hanson]]. It was filmed in 2003 and released on June 3, 2008 [[direct-to-video]]. The film was [[Rodney Dangerfield]]'s final film role, prior to his death in October 2004.\n\n== Plot ==\nThe plot revolves around a fictitious ''Onion'' television news [[anchorman]], Norm Archer ([[Len Cariou]]), who is forced to face the inevitability of a corporate takeover by the ''Onion''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s perennial fictitious [[Multinational corporation|multinational]], [[Our Dumb Century#Running gags|Global Tetrahedron]]. ''Onion'' news is described as \"[[fair and balanced]]\" in the context of the film. The plot serves as a springboard for various [[Sketch comedy|comedy sketches]] featuring ''The Onion''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s satirical humor. Vignettes include parodies of music videos reminiscent of [[Britney Spears]]' work, and [[Steven Seagal]] appearing as a parody of the type of action hero he normally portrays. The film is [[Fourth wall|interrupted]] (fictitiously) by film reviewers and commentators weighing in on the progress of the film, with one commentator preparing to stage an immediate walkout of all African American audience members unless a positive portrayal of an African American is inserted into the film.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Len Cariou]] as Norm Archer\n* [[Larissa Laskin]] as Dana Dobbs\n* [[Scott Klace]] as Kip Kendall\n* [[Steven Seagal]] as Cock Puncher\n* Sarah McElligott as Melissa Cherry\n* [[Brendan Fletcher]] as Tim, a [[Wigger|white black guy]]\n* [[Richard Fancy]] as Kenneth Garber\n* [[Murphy Dunne]] as Raymond Marcus\n* [[Alex Solowitz]] as The Masses\n* [[Paul Scheer]] as Dirk, a Bates computer salesman \n* [[Nick Chinlund]] as Bryce Brand\n* [[Jim Rash]] as Bryce's manager\n* [[Jed Rees]] as Wizard proteus\n* [[Greg Pitts]] as Wizards dragonmaster\n* [[Greg Cipes]] as Hippie diplomant\n* [[Yevgeni Lazarev]] as Slovesevic\n* Adam Gregor as Birajko\n* [[Ahmed Ahmed]] as Ahmed\n* [[Kevin Federline]] as Lollipop Love dancer\n* [[Robert Hoffman (actor)|Robert Hoffman]] as Lollipop Love dancer\n* Jen Cohn as cooking show host\n* [[Meredith Baxter]] as chef on cooking show \n* [[Chrissy Metz]] as Heavy Girl \n* [[Erik Stolhanske]] as producer\n* [[Michael Bolton]] as himself\n* [[Rodney Dangerfield]] as himself\n* Sal Lopez and Jay Montalvo as Peruvians\n}}\n\n==Production==\nIn 2003, New Regency Productions and [[Fox Searchlight Pictures]] were on board to produce and release a movie written by ''The Onion'' staff. Tentatively titled ''The Untitled Onion Movie'', it was to be directed by music video director Tom Kuntz and Mike Maguire and written by then ''Onion'' editor Robert Siegel and writer Todd Hanson with the rest of the Onion staff. After delays and previews to test audiences, the film was shelved and eventually dropped by Fox. [[New Regency Productions]] continued on with the project.\n\nIn a March 15, 2007 interview, [[Scott Aukerman]] said that the Onion movie was at a \"dead standstill\".<ref name=\"Ben Kharakh, That Other Paper\">{{cite web|url=http://thatotherpaper.com/austin/the_fun_bunch_do_you_believe_in_inevitabilities|title=The Fun Bunch: Do you believe in inevitabilities!?: 2007 ''That Other Paper'' Article}}</ref> Additionally, ''Onion, Inc.''
