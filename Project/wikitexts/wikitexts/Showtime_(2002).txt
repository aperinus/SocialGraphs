The film stars [[Robert De Niro]] and [[Eddie Murphy]] in the lead roles alongside [[Rene Russo]], [[William Shatner]], [[Pedro Damian]] and De Niro's real life daughter [[Drena De Niro]]. The film was released in the United States on March 15, 2002. The film received generally negative reviews, with critics lamenting its lackluster humour and poor attempt to satirize the buddy cop genre. It received two nominations at the [[23rd Golden Raspberry Awards]]: [[Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Actor|Worst Actor]] (for Murphy), and [[Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Screen Combo|Worst Screen Combo]] (for Murphy and DeNiro).\n\n==Plot==\nTwo [[Los Angeles Police Department|LAPD]] cops, Detective Mitch Preston and Officer Trey Sellars, both from the Central Division, are paired for a reality police show and run into real trouble with a crime lord. Mitch shoots a news camera after a failed confrontation local drug dealer Lazy Boy, who escapes by using a custom-built gun. Maxxis Television, the fictional network that employed the cameraman, decides to sue the police department for $10 million, but will drop the lawsuit if Mitch agrees to star in a reality cop television show, which Trey later calls ''Showtime!''.\n\nTrey enters the picture shortly after, as an LAPD officer who actually wants to be an actor while also trying to become a detective. He pays a friend to snatch the purse of the show's producer, Chase Renzi, and then retrieves it after a staged fight scene. Even though the deception is embarrassingly revealed, Chase is impressed and signs Trey on anyway. It is quickly revealed that the show's producers have little interest in filming an actual police officer's existence; they build a mini-movie set in the middle of the station, and replace Mitch's nondescript personal car with a [[Humvee]], while Trey drives a [[Chevrolet Corvette (C5)|C5 Corvette]]. They also hire [[William Shatner]] (who once played [[T. J. Hooker]]) to give both men tips on how to act; while Trey is eager to learn, Mitch is merely annoyed.\n\nDespite all this, Mitch tries to investigate the mysterious supergun, which is subsequently used by arms dealer Caesar Vargas to kill the drug dealer and his girlfriend. Through a clever ruse by Trey, they are able to get the arms dealer's name from Re-Run, the dead dealer's henchman. However, Vargas is less than cooperative, which causes a brawl at his nightclub. Trey and Mitch are able to defeat him and his henchmen, and subsequently have a relatively friendly conversation on their way home. However, Mitch's good humor evaporates when he finds that, in his absence, the Showtime producers have drastically remodeled his house and given him a retired K-9 dog as a pet.\n\nVargas and his crew assault an armored car and kill the crew, then devastate the police who respond. Trey and Mitch arrive and are pulled into the shootout. When the attackers flee in a garbage truck, Mitch gives chase in a police car. In the ensuing mayhem, the car is rammed by the garbage truck, which winds up crashing into a construction site. Mitch survives by jumping from the police car to Trey's sports car (he had previously denounced \"hood-jumping\" as a useless skill). In the wake of the disaster, the police chief pulls the plug on the show, suspends Mitch from duty and demotes Trey back to patrol.\n\nWith the show ended, Mitch's car is returned and his apartment restored (but he refuses to return the dog, of which he has grown fond). While watching the final episode, Mitch calls Trey and apologizes for his actions and even offers him to help ask questions on the detective exam. But while doing so, Mitch sees one of his police colleagues at Vargas's nightclub. He and Trey investigate, finding that Vargas is selling the weapons at a gun show at the [[Westin Bonaventure Hotel|Bonaventure Hotel]]. Vargas flees with one of the weapons, taking Chase hostage in the process. The duo is able to rescue her, via a pocket pistol concealed in a Maxxis camera, but the ceiling of the room is shot. It is located just below the pool, so it floods, and Vargas is washed out the window to his death, Trey manages to save himself and Mitch by handcuffing them together. They wind up suspended from a broken beam outside the hotel.\n\nTrey is promoted to detective, and he and Mitch are now partners and still working together with a new case, and there are hints of a romance between Chase and Mitch. Showtime is revived and in its second season, this time with two young and attractive female officers, who are just as antagonistic as Mitch and Trey were.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Robert De Niro]] as Detective Mitch Preston\n* [[Eddie Murphy]] as Officer Trey Sellars\n* [[Rene Russo]] as Chase Renzi\n* [[Pedro Dami\u00e1n|Pedro Damian]] as Cesar Vargas\n* [[Mos Def]] as 'Lazy Boy'\n* [[Frankie Faison|Frankie R.
