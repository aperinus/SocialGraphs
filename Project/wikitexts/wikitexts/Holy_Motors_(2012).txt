He opens it and wanders into a movie theater full of sleeping patrons. A naked child and several dogs wander the aisles.\n\nMeanwhile, in [[Paris]], a rich man waves goodbye to his family and gets into a white limousine. His driver, C\u00e9line, calls him Mr. Oscar and tells him he has nine appointments that day. He reads a file, uncovers a mirror, and begins to brush a grey wig. Over the course of the day, he:\n* plays an old woman beggar on the [[Pont Alexandre III]].\n* dons a [[motion capture]] suit and enters an empty [[sound stage]], where he performs action sequences while being directed by an unseen man. A woman in a motion capture suit enters, and the pair perform movements that are used to create a sex scene between animated snakelike creatures.\n* plays the role of [[Tokyo!#.22Merde.22|Monsieur Merde]], an eccentric and violent red-haired man who lives in the sewers and kidnaps a beautiful model called Kay M. from a photo shoot in a cemetery.\n* plays a father who picks up his daughter from a party in an old red car. They argue when the daughter reveals she spent the party hiding in the bathroom instead of socializing.\n* (as an interlude) plays a song on the accordion in a church with an ever-growing group of musicians.\n* plays a gangster assigned to murder a man who looks identical to him. After he has stabbed the man in the neck and carved scars into the man's face that match his own, the victim suddenly stabs Oscar in the neck. Oscar manages to limp his way back to the limousine, seemingly severely injured. While Oscar is removing his makeup, a man with a [[port-wine stain]] on his face reveals his presence in the limo. The man asks Oscar if he still enjoys his work, since he has looked \"tired\" recently. Oscar admits it is harder now that he cannot see the cameras, but says he continues for \"the beauty of the act\".\n* yells at C\u00e9line to stop, runs from the limo wearing a red [[Balaclava (clothing)|balaclava]] covered with [[barbed wire]], and shoots a banker who looks just like he did in the morning when he left for his first appointment. He is gunned down by the banker's bodyguards and C\u00e9line rushes to him. As she leads him away, she apologizes and says there has been a mix-up.\n* plays the elderly \"Mr. Vogan\", who enters a hotel and gets into bed in one of the rooms. Vogan's niece L\u00e9a enters, they talk about their lives, and he dies. While L\u00e9a cries, Oscar gets out of bed and excuses himself to go to another appointment. He asks L\u00e9a her real name, and she says it is \u00c9lise and that she also has another appointment.\n* (in what does not seem to be one of his appointments) is almost hit by another white limousine, whose female passenger he recognizes. Still in pajamas, Oscar asks if they can talk, and they go to the abandoned [[La Samaritaine]] building, where Jean (the woman) says they have 20 minutes to catch up on the past 20 years before her \"partner\" arrives and she will play the last night of an air hostess named Eva Grace. As they ascend to the roof of the building, she sings a wistful song that indicates she and Oscar \"once had a child\". Oscar leaves her and, avoiding the male partner on the staircase, returns to his limo. When he sees that Eva and the partner have jumped to their deaths from the top of the building, he lets out an anguished cry and runs past them.\n* plays a man whose wife and children are chimpanzees.\n\nAlone, C\u00e9line drives to the Holy Motors garage, which is filled with other limousines. She parks, places a white mask on her face,<ref group=note>Edith Scob, who plays C\u00e9line, wore an identical mask in her best-known role in ''[[Eyes Without a Face (film)|Eyes Without a Face]]''.

Financiers were reluctant to invest, so Carax, whose previous feature film was ''[[Pola X]]'' in 1999, decided to make a smaller French-language film first, with the aim of regaining prominence in international cinema.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Blondeau|first=Romain|date=2011-06-10|url=http://www.lesinrocks.com/cine/cinema-article/t/66394/date/2011-06-10/article/le-grand-retour-de-leos-carax-sans-juliette-binoche/|title=Le grand retour de Leos Carax, sans Juliette Binoche|language=fr|work=[[Les Inrockuptibles]]|access-date=2011-08-21|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120320011938/http://www.lesinrocks.com/cine/cinema-article/t/66394/date/2011-06-10/article/le-grand-retour-de-leos-carax-sans-juliette-binoche/|archive-date=20 March 2012}}</ref> Taking inspiration from the omnibus ''[[Tokyo!]]'', for which he had made a commissioned [[short film]] (''Merde'', which featured the original appearance of the character Monsieur Merde), he wrote a cheap film intended for his regular collaborator [[Denis Lavant]]. Carax was able to sway potential investors concerned with the film's budget by switching to digital photography, a process of which he strongly disapproves.<ref name=pkinterview>{{Cite web|last=Frodon|first=Jean-Michel|year=2012|url=http://www.festival-cannes.fr/assets/Image/Direct/045904.pdf|title=Interview with Leos Carax|work=Holy Motors press kit|publisher=[[Wild Bunch (film company)|Wild Bunch]]|access-date=2012-05-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121222071623/http://www.festival-cannes.fr/assets/Image/Direct/045904.pdf|archive-date=22 December 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nThe spark for the film came from Carax's observation that stretch limousines were being increasingly used for weddings. He was interested in their bulkiness, saying: \"They're outdated, like the old futurist toys of the past. I think they mark the end of an era, the era of large, visible machines.\"<ref name=pkinterview /> From that grew an idea for a film about the increasing digitalisation of society, a science-fiction scenario where organisms and visible machines share a common superfluity. The opening scene was inspired by the [[E. T. A. Hoffmann]] novella ''Don Juan'', about a man who discovers a secret door in his bedroom that leads to an opera house.<ref name=pkinterview />\n\n''Holy Motors'' was produced through Pierre Grise Productions for a budget of \u20ac3.9 million, which included money from the [[National Center of Cinematography and the moving image|CNC]], [[\u00cele-de-France (region)|\u00cele-de-France region]], [[Arte|Arte France]], [[Canal+]], and Cin\u00e9+.<ref name=\"budget\">{{Cite web|last=Lemercier|first=Fabien|date=2011-06-10|url=http://cineuropa.org/2011/nw.aspx?t=newsdetail&lang=en&documentID=205054|title=Arte France Cin\u00e9ma backs Carax's ''Holly Motors''|work=cineuropa.org|publisher=Cineuropa|access-date=2011-08-21}}</ref> It was a 20% German co-production through the company Pandora, and received \u20ac350,000 from the Franco-German co-production support committee.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Prot|first=B\u00e9n\u00e9dicte|date=2011-07-14|url=http://cineuropa.org/2011/nw.aspx?t=newsdetail&lang=en&documentID=207193|title=Franco-German committee backs three films|work=cineuropa.org|publisher=Cineuropa|access-date=2011-08-21}}</ref>\n\n===Casting===\nOf the lead role, Carax said: \"If Denis had said no, I would have offered the part to [[Lon Chaney, Sr.|Lon Chaney]] or to [[Charlie Chaplin|Chaplin]].

He also thought ''Holy Motors'' was indebted to [[Georges Franju]]'s ''[[Eyes Without a Face (film)|Eyes Without a Face]]'', in which Scob starred, and decided to give an explicit nod to the film by casting her.\n\nThe character Kay M. came from a canceled project that was supposed to star Lavant and [[Kate Moss]] and follow the Merde character from ''Tokyo!'' in the United States. [[Eva Mendes]] was offered the role after she and Carax met at a film festival and agreed to make a film together.\n\nCarax discovered [[Kylie Minogue]] after [[Claire Denis]] suggested her for a canceled project.\n\n[[Michel Piccoli]]'s role was originally intended for Carax himself, but he decided it would be misleading to cast a filmmaker. When Piccoli was cast, the idea was to make him unrecognizable and credit him under a pseudonym, but news of his casting reached the media, so that plan was dropped.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Carax|first=Leos|year=2012|url=http://www.festival-cannes.fr/assets/Image/Direct/045904.pdf|title=Les Acteurs|work=Holy Motors press kit|publisher=[[Wild Bunch (film company)|Wild Bunch]]|access-date=2012-05-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121222071623/http://www.festival-cannes.fr/assets/Image/Direct/045904.pdf|archive-date=22 December 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===Filming and post-production===\n[[Principal photography]] took place in Paris.
