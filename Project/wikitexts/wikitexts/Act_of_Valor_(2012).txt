The mastermind, a [[Chechen people|Chechen]] terrorist, Abu Shabal, escapes to a training camp in Indonesia. Elsewhere in [[Costa Rica]], two [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] officers, Walter Ross and Lisa Morales, meet to consolidate intelligence about their target, a drug smuggler named Mikhail \"Christo\" Troykovich. Christo's men kill Ross and capture Morales, who is imprisoned in a jungle compound and tortured.\n\nAt [[Naval Base Coronado|Coronado]], the members of Bandito Platoon, [[United States Navy SEALs|SEAL Team 7]] are at home. [[Lieutenant (navy)|Lieutenant]] Rorke confides to Chief Dave that his wife is pregnant and has the entire team spend time together with their families until their next deployment. A squad from the platoon consisting of Rorke, Dave, Wiemy, Mikey, Ray, Sonny, and Ajay, is then deployed to Costa Rica to exfiltrate Morales.\n\nThe seven Navy SEALs insert into the jungle via [[High altitude military parachuting|HALO]] and hold position outside the compound all night. At dawn, they approach the compound and engage several enemy guards.  Mikey is shot in the head, blinding him in one eye, and knocking him unconscious, though he survives. The SEALs extract Morales, escaping with her and recovering a cellphone full of the information she had gathered. However, the gunfight alerts the enemy [[quick reaction force]]. The SEALs commandeer an enemy truck and exfiltrate. The hot pursuit forces them to revert to a tertiary extraction point where two [[Special warfare combatant-craft crewmen|SWCC]] boats extract the team and neutralize the enemy pursuit with [[minigun]]s.\n\nChristo and Shabal, who are revealed to have been childhood friends, meet in [[Kyiv]]. Christo knows the CIA is watching him and informs Shabal that subordinates will complete their project, which is to equip suicide bombers with specialized undetectable [[explosive vest]]s.\n\nOn the [[amphibious assault ship]] [[USS Bonhomme Richard (LHD-6)|USS ''Bonhomme Richard'']], Rorke is informed that the intelligence recovered confirms Shabal and Christo were working together. Shabal, an old-school Islamic terrorist, seeks to bring jihad to the U.S., while Christo provides the routes for smuggling drugs and people into the U.S. Ajay and Ray are sent to [[Somalia]], where an arms transfer involving Shabal is taking place. The remaining SEALs, comprising Rorke, Dave, Sonny and Weimy, stay in the U.S. in case the terrorists make it in. Miller himself has been reassigned to SEAL Team Four, hunting for Christo somewhere on the oceans. Lieutenant Rorke gives Dave a letter to give to his family in case he is killed.\n\nShabal and sixteen terrorists are found to be on an island off [[Baja California peninsula|Baja California]], where the SEALs act to secure the island, killing eight terrorists. Shabal and eight others escape. Elsewhere, in the South Pacific, SEAL Team Four captures Christo and [[interrogate]] him, learning that Shabal's plot is to create panic and economic disruption to outdo the [[September 11 attacks]].\n\nThe SEALs are informed that Shabal is en route to the U.S. via tunnels underneath a milk factory, and are ordered to link up with [[Mexican Special Forces]] and neutralize the remaining targets. Arriving at the factory, the SEALs and Mexican forces launch an assault there, engaging numerous Mexican cartel and Shabal's terrorists in the process. During the gunfight, a combatant throws a grenade, and Rorke sacrifices himself by [[Falling on a grenade|diving on it]] to save his team before it detonates, killing him. Dave pursues the terrorists and shoots them as they try to escape through the tunnels. He is then shot several times and gravely wounded by Shabal, who is intercepted and killed by Sonny before he could execute Dave.\n\nAt home, Rorke is given a [[military funeral]] with full honors, where the SEALs pay their respects. It is then revealed that Dave's narration throughout the movie was a written letter meant for Rorke's son. The film ends with a dedication to 60 U.S. Navy SEAL and Special Warfare Combatant-craft Crewmen (SWCC) killed in action since 9/11 along with a listing of their names as well as a photo montage of fallen public servants.\n\n==Cast==\n* Jason Cottle as Yuri / Mohammad Abu Shabal, a Chechen terrorist \n* [[Derrick Van Orden]] as Senior Chief Otto Miller\n* [[Rorke Denver]] as Lieutenant Rorke James Engel, field commander of SEAL Team 7\n* Dave Hansen as Chief Dave Nolan, a Chief of SEAL Team 7\n* Sonny Manson as Sonny, a member of SEAL Team 7\n* Brendan \u201cWeimy\u201d Weimholt as 'Weimy', a member of SEAL Team 7\n* Ajay \"A.J.\" James as Ajay, a member of SEAL Team 7\n* Ray Mendoza as Ray, a member of SEAL Team 7\n* Douglas \u201cMike\u201d Day as Mikey, a member of SEAL Team 7\n* Katelyn Lyons as Lieutenant Lyons, a US Navy officer (the real character serves in the [[U.S. Army]])\n* William \"Bill\" Austin as SWCC Boat Senior Chief Billy\n* Duncan Smith as Captain Duncan Smith\n* Callaghan as Admiral Callaghan (the true character name is Rear Admiral Dennis Moynihan)\n* [[Alex Veadov]] as Mikhail 'Christo' Troykovich,<ref name=\"YahooCast\">{{cite web|url=https://movies.yahoo.com/movie/1810125178/cast|title=Act of Valor (2012)|work=[[Yahoo!

After spending so much time working closely with the SEALs and SWCC, McCoy and Waugh conceived the idea for a modern-day action movie about this covert and elite fighting force. As ''Act of Valor'' developed with the SEALs on board as advisors, the filmmakers realized that no actors could realistically portray or physically fill the roles they had written and the actual SEALs and SWCC were drafted to star in the film.
