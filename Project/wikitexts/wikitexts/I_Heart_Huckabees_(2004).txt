Russell]], who co-wrote the screenplay with [[Jeff Baena]].\n\nA self-described \"existential comedy\", ''I Heart Huckabees'' follows a pair of detectives ([[Dustin Hoffman]] and [[Lily Tomlin]]), hired to investigate the meaning of the life of their clients ([[Jude Law]], [[Jason Schwartzman]], [[Mark Wahlberg]], and [[Naomi Watts]]). As the different investigations cross paths, their rival and nemesis ([[Isabelle Huppert]]) tries to drag their clients into her own views on the meaning of their lives.\n\n==Plot==\nYoung Albert Markovski heads the local chapter of the \"Open Spaces Coalition\" environmental group. One of their current projects is stopping the building of a new chain store \"[[Big-box store|big-box]]\" department stores, Huckabees.\n\nAlbert is a rival of Brad Stand, a shallow executive at Huckabees. Brad infiltrates Open Spaces and charismatically displaces Albert as the leader. Dawn Campbell is Brad's live-in girlfriend and the face and voice of Huckabees; appearing in all of the store's ads.\n\nAfter seeing the same conspicuous stranger three times, Albert contacts a couple of [[Existentialism|existential]] detectives, Bernard and Vivian Jaffe. They offer him their optimistic brand of existentialism\u2014they call ''universal interconnectivity'' (combining [[Romanticism|romantic]] and [[Transcendentalism|transcendentalist]] philosophies)\u2014and spy on him, ostensibly to help him solve the coincidence. Fireman Tommy Corn is another client of the Jaffe's, with an idealistic, obsessively anti-petroleum-industry philosophy. They introduce Albert to Tommy as his '[[Other (philosophy)|other]]', and they become friends.\n\nTommy grows dissatisfied with the Jaffes, feeling they are not helping. Seeking out other possibilities, He ends up abandoning and undermining the Jaffes by introducing Albert to Caterine Vauban, a former student of the Jaffes who espouses a seemingly opposing [[Nihilism|nihilistic]]/[[Absurdism|absurdist]] philosophy.\n\nCaterine teaches them to disconnect their inner beings from their daily lives and problems, to synthesize a non-thinking state of \"pure being.\" Lifted from their troubles, they wish to keep that feeling forever. But she says it is inevitable to be drawn back into human drama, and the core truth of it is misery and meaninglessness. To prove her point, Caterine takes Albert into the woods to have sex, leaving Tommy behind. He finds out about it and feels hurt. She tells him that they found each other through all of the human suffering and drama. Tommy rejects this idea and leaves them, furious and lost.\n\nMeanwhile, in Brad's further attempts to undercut Albert, he and Dawn meet with and are influenced by Bernard and Vivian. In the following days, Brad and Dawn rethink their entire lives: she rejects the modeling world, looking for deeper meaning, while he realizes his whole ascent up the corporate ladder is meaningless, as he has focused his whole life on trying to please others and not himself.\n\nAll the storylines collide when Brad's house catches fire. While the fire trucks get stuck in a traffic jam, Tommy arrives on his bicycle to put out the fire, which also trapped Dawn inside. As he saves her life, they fall in love. Meanwhile, Brad despairs at the destruction of his home, the symbol of his material success. Albert attains a sort of [[Enlightenment (spiritual)|enlightenment]] when he synthesizes the two opposing outlooks of the Jaffes and Caterine to realize the cosmic truth of everything.\n\nBrad, meanwhile, is fired from Huckabees, leaving him rudderless. Albert reveals to him that the fire started when he burned Brad's jet skis, then it spread to the rest of the house. He says they are no different, that everything really is inextricably connected, but that these connections necessarily arise from the often senselessly painful reality of human existence. Having realized this, he refers Brad to Caterine, believing she can help him as she did Albert and Tommy.\n\nAlbert and Tommy talk later about everything that has happened. Caterine and the Jaffes watch them from afar, concluding they can close both of their cases.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Dustin Hoffman]] as Bernard Jaffe\n* [[Isabelle Huppert]] as Caterine Vauban\n* [[Jude Law]] as Brad Stand\n* [[Jason Schwartzman]] as Albert Markovski\n* [[Lily Tomlin]] as Vivian Jaffe\n* [[Mark Wahlberg]] as Tommy Corn\n* [[Naomi Watts]] as Dawn Campbell\n* [[Ger Duany]] as Stephen Nimieri\n* [[Isla Fisher]] as Heather\n* Sydney Zarp as Cricket Hooten\n* [[Jonah Hill]] as Bret Hooten\n* [[Richard Jenkins]] as Mr. Hooten (''uncredited'') \n* [[Darlene Hunt]] as Darlene\n* [[Kevin Dunn]] as Marty\n* Benny Hernandez as Davy\n* [[Richard Appel]] as Josh\n* Benjamin Nurick as Harrison\n* [[Jake Muxworthy]] as Tim\n* [[Tippi Hedren]] as Mary Jane Hutchinson\n* Altagracia Guzman as Mrs. Echevarria\n* [[Sa\u00efd Taghmaoui]] as Translator\n* [[Bob Gunton]] as Mr. Silver\n* [[Talia Shire]] as Mrs. Silver\n* [[Jean Smart]] as Mrs. Hooten\n* [[Shania Twain]] as herself\n{{div col end}}\n\nThe film features the screen debuts of [[Jonah Hill]] (in a minor role) and [[Ger Duany]].\n\n==Production==\nBefore directing his first feature, ''[[Spanking the Monkey]]'', Russell intended to make a film  \"about a guy who sits in the back of a Chinese restaurant with microphones on every table to surreptitiously listen to everybody\u2019s conversations, then write perversely personal fortunes for each of the people.\"<ref name=\"AFIindie\">{{cite web|last1=Schmidlin|first1=Charlie|title=AFI: David O.

In the meantime Russell was called for [[jury duty]], after which he stopped writing the film. Ideas in the script stayed with him though and they would later form the basis for the Huckabee script.<ref name=\"AFIindie\"/> The final idea came to Russell in a dream where \"This female detective she was not following me for criminal reasons, but she was following me for spiritual and metaphysical reasons.\" Russell, who makes a habit of writing his dreams down, knew instantly upon reading his summary of the dream that this was the story he wanted to pursue.<ref name=\"filmfour\">{{cite web|title=David O Russell on I Heart Huckabees|url=http://www.film4.com/special-features/interviews/david-o-russell-on-i-heart-huckabees|website=Film4|access-date=March 21, 2017|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170321165625/http://www.film4.com/special-features/interviews/david-o-russell-on-i-heart-huckabees|archive-date=March 21, 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn March 2007, two videos were leaked onto [[YouTube]] portraying on-set arguments between Russell and Tomlin. When the ''[[Miami New Times]]'' asked Tomlin about the videos, she responded, \"I love David. There was a lot of pressure in making the movie\u2014even the way it came out you could see it was a very free-associative, crazy movie, and David was under a tremendous amount of pressure.

His unique methods for writing previous film scores (''[[Punch-Drunk Love]]'', ''[[Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind]]'') involved very close collaboration with the director. Through this process, David O. Russell was able to sit in the same room with Brion and watch an early cut of the film. Russell described what he wanted to portray and Brion would compose music to Russell's descriptions. The process can be seen on a featurette on the film's special edition DVD.\n\nDavid O. Russell, while working with Brion, had come across Brion's first solo album, ''[[Meaningless (album)|Meaningless]]''. Russell has mentioned that Brion's album asks similar questions to the ones Russell was trying to ask with ''I Heart Huckabees''. In particular, Russell notes that the questions on ''Meaningless'' are closer to the questions directed from Caterine Vauban's negative and dark point of view.\n\nMany cues used in the film feature a [[Chamberlin]], a keyboard instrument from the 1950s that replicates instrumental sounds using recorded tape.\n\n==Release==\n===Marketing===\nIn an advertising campaign for the film, four fictional websites were created. They were portrayed as if they were actual websites involving the characters and organizations featured in the film. Each website had a link called \"Disclaimer\" at the bottom that leads to FOX Searchlight's [https://web.archive.org/web/20041001090202/http://www2.foxsearchlight.com/huckabees/ official website] for the film.
