Rapp's directorial debut, the film premiered at the 2005 [[Toronto International Film Festival]] to mixed reviews and received a [[limited theatrical release]] in February 2006. The film was not released in the United Kingdom until 2013, when it was released under the new title ''Happy Endings''.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Cummings |first1=Chris |title=\u2018Happy Endings\u2019 Review |url=https://www.nerdly.co.uk/2013/10/08/happy-endings-review/ |website=nerdly.co.uk |access-date=9 September 2022 |date=2013-10-08}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nReese Holdin is a [[clinical depression|depressed]] bartender and actress living in [[New York City]]. She regularly engages in casual sex, [[cocaine]] use and [[self-harm]]. Reese, who happens to be the daughter of a famous author named Don Holdin, is approached by a publishing agent who offers her $100,000 for a series of old letters written between her reclusive father and her late mother. When Reese learns that the kitten she rescued from the streets is dying of [[Feline leukemia virus|feline leukemia]], she drowns it and buys a bus ticket to [[Michigan]]'s [[Upper Peninsula of Michigan|Upper Peninsula]] to retrieve the letters.\n\nReturning to her childhood home, she finds it occupied by Corbit, a down-and-out [[Christians|Christian]] musician, and Shelly, a 23-year-old former student of Don's. Reese's father now lives, writes and drinks in his garage. Reese initially clashes with the doting Shelly (whom she accuses of sleeping with her father) but eventually accepts her after learning of the death of her parents and of Don's support of her during a near-fatal illness [[endometriosis]]. She also bonds with the idiosyncratic Corbit, who spurns her sexual advances and has trouble playing guitar and singing at the same time. She feels out of place at home and fights with her father over childhood neglect, stating that her parents gave their typewriters more attention. She eventually finds the box of letters and, reading the emotional communiques, learns to empathize with her estranged parents. Shelly has also read the letters and asks Reese if she intends to publish them. Reese expresses ambiguity over the matter.\n\nDon is still grieving over his wife's death. He keeps the tie she hanged herself with in a dresser in the backyard along with the rest of their bedroom suite, including their bed. He sometimes sleeps in the bed despite the bitter cold of winter. Reese starts to connect with Corbit and Shelly and is honest with her father about her reasons for staying away from the funeral. Soon after, Don overdoses on sleeping pills and Reese finds him unconscious. He recovers in the hospital, where Reese sits by his bed and reads his latest manuscript, ''Golf'', which he had Corbit bury in the yard. The experience helps the father and daughter find closure, and Reese buries the box of letters in place of the novel before returning to New York.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Zooey Deschanel]] as Reese Holdin\n* [[Ed Harris]] as Don Holdin\n* [[Will Ferrell]] as Corbit\n* [[Amelia Warner]] as Shelly\n* [[Mary Jo Deschanel]] as Mary\n* [[Amy Madigan]] as Lori Lansky\n* [[Michael Chernus]] as Ben\n* [[Deirdre O'Connell (actress)|Deirdre O'Connell]] as Deirdre\n* [[Anthony Rapp]] as Dean\n* [[Jim True-Frost]] as Dr. Staley\n* [[Sam Bottoms]] as Brian \n* [[Rachel Dratch]] as Female MC\n}}\n\n== Production ==\nAccording to playwright [[Adam Rapp]], the film originated as an idea for a two-act [[Play (theatre)|play]]. Said Rapp, \"I'm a big fan of [[J. D. Salinger|J.D. Salinger]], and I know someone who knows Salinger's son. Matt [Salinger] went to his father's house for [[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving]] about six years ago. His father opened boxes of manuscripts he'd been working on for 50 years. He asked his son to burn them after he died. What bitterness. I thought, that'd be an interesting character. How do you relate to a character with a splintered mind who's started to slip into madness? What about the children of the artist? That was the germ of the idea.\"<ref>{{Cite web |last=Hayes |first=John |date=March 29, 2006 |title='Winter Passing': Playwright Adam Rapp brings sibling rivalry to his first film |url=https://www.post-gazette.com/ae/movies/2006/03/30/Winter-Passing-Playwright-Adam-Rapp-brings-sibling-rivalry-to-his-first-film/stories/200603300283 |access-date=2022-09-09 |website=[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]] |language=en}}</ref>\n\nThough the film is mostly set in [[Michigan]], it was primarily filmed in [[New Jersey]].<ref name=mlive/>\n\n==Reception==\nSome film critics have voiced theories that one or more of the film's characters are based on famous writers or poets.
