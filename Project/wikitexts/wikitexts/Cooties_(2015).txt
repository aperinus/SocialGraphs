The film stars [[Elijah Wood]], [[Alison Pill]], [[Rainn Wilson]], [[Jack McBrayer]], Whannell, [[Nasim Pedrad]], Brennan, and [[Jorge Garcia]] as a group of elementary school employees who fight to survive an outbreak among students that turn them into aggressive and cannibalistic zombies when someone eats chicken nuggets containing a virus.\n\nThe film had its world premiere at the [[Sundance Film Festival]] on January 18, 2015,<ref name=\"IWReview\">{{cite web|url=https://indiewire.com/article/sundance-review-elijah-wood-vehicle-cooties-is-gross-genre-fun|title=Sundance Review: Elijah Wood Vehicle 'Cooties' Is Gross Genre Fun|first=Kyle|last=Burton|date=20 January 2014|publisher=}}</ref> before being released on September 18, 2016, in a [[limited release]] and through [[video on demand]] by [[Lionsgate Premiere]].<ref name=\"joblo1\">{{cite web|last=Woods|first=Kevin|url=https://joblo.com/horror-movies/news/cooties-to-open-stanley-film-festival-hits-theatersvod-in-september-280|title=Cooties to open Stanley Film Festival; hits theaters/VOD in September - Horror Movie News &#124; Arrow in the Head|website=Joblo|date=7 April 2015 |accessdate=2015-06-13}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nIn Fort Chicken, [[Illinois]], a batch of badly made [[chicken nugget]]s containing a mutant virus arrives at Fort Chicken Elementary. A student, fourth-grader Shelley Linker, consumes one of the tainted black-dotted chicken nuggets. Meanwhile, an aspiring [[Horror story|horror]] writer named Clint Hadson substitutes at Fort Chicken Elementary, where he is reunited with his former [[high school]] crush Lucy McCormick, whom he learned is dating the physical education teacher Wade Johnson.\n\nDuring Clint's class, a kid named Patriot is attacked by the blister-ridden and increasingly feral Shelley after he inadvertently pulls a pigtail out of her scalp, with Clint being scratched by her before she flees. After Patriot is taken to the nurse's office, Patriot's friend Dink confronts Shelley while she attempts to dig her way out of the school. Dink plans to report Shelly to the principal's office by turning her in, but Shelley ends up infecting Dink, who then spreads it throughout the playground by scratching the majority of the children before they all proceed to kill several staff members including Mr. Peterson, Vice Principal Simms, and Sheriff Dave.\n\nLater, Clint, Lucy, Wade, and the other surviving staff members (consisting of Doug Davis, Tracy Lacey, and Rebekkah Halverson) are forced to flee the faculty lounge when attacked by Patriot. After escaping to the library and being joined by an uninfected student named Calvin, the staff barricades themselves in the music room. Wade notices Clint has been scratched by Shelley and quarantines him; meanwhile, Doug deduces that Clint is only experiencing symptoms of [[Gastroenteritis|stomach flu]] as the virus does not affect adults like it does on children. A sole uninfected student full of wisdom, Calvin concludes that \"cooties\" are the culprit behind the infection, completely moving the entire staff.\n\nThe staff plans to head to the roof at the end of the school day to call out to the arriving parents for help, only to watch the first arriving parent be killed by her own child before they are forced back into the school. As Wade is forced to kill Dink when he followed them into the auditorium, the group is joined by a teenager named Tamra, who they found was scratched by one of the infected kids. Doug concludes from his autopsy of Dink that the infected children are mostly brain dead and the virus only affects people that haven't gone through puberty, meaning that Tamra is safe. As Patriot takes out the power, the group sees that Calvin starts passing out from diabetic shock as they escape with the school janitor Hitachi and take refuge with him.\n\nThe group sends Clint through the ventilation system to get a chocolate bar for Calvin, along with Wade's truck keys and their cellphones. Lucy joins Clint and they manage to secure a chocolate bar to bring Calvin out of diabetic shock. Clint and Lucy are separated from the group and get trapped in the library, where they confess their feelings for each other and kiss. Shortly after, Wade apologizes to Lucy for his behavior over a walkie-talkie. Clint knocks out several children with pills and he and Lucy reconvene with Wade and the others as they made themselves improvised weapons. The staff fights their way through the hallway and the parking lot, with Hitachi being overwhelmed by the infected children inside the school, while Wade stays behind to ensure the others get away. Patriot, having hidden in Wade's truck bed, attacks Clint and ends up being crushed against a tree with the truck.\n\nThe group continues to the nearby town of Danville (Fort Chicken's rival town) before Wade's truck runs out of gas, finding the town similarly overrun while learning the viral infection has spread across the country. Several children ambush them, and they barricade themselves inside a children's entertainment building where they retrieve a contaminated chicken nugget for Doug to study in hope of developing a vaccine. They are later cornered in a playroom by Shelley and the infected children. Wade and Hitachi arrive in a van and help the group escape the room. Wade uses a massive beach ball to barricade the children inside while spraying them with a [[water gun]] filled with gasoline, lighting the gasoline trail to burn the building down. They manage to escape, driving out of the town to \"someplace kids don't wanna go\" as Shelley burns to death in pursuit.\n\nIn a post-credits scene, Hitachi is seen at the school, sitting in a chair and having his snack, and finishes telling a story he was telling the teachers earlier.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Elijah Wood]] as Clint Hadson\n* [[Rainn Wilson]] as Wade Johnson\n* [[Alison Pill]] as Lucy McCormick\n* [[Jack McBrayer]] as Tracy Lacey\n* [[Leigh Whannell]] as Doug Davis\n* [[Nasim Pedrad]] as Rebekkah Halverson\n* [[Ian Brennan (writer)|Ian Brennan]] as Vice Principal Simms\n* [[Jorge Garcia]] as Rick\n* Sunny May Allison as Shelley Linker\n* [[Cooper Roth]] as Patriot\n* Miles Elliot as Dink\n* Armani Jackson as Calvin\n* [[Morgan Lily]] as Tamra\n* Peter Kwong as Mr. Hatachi\n* [[Kate Flannery]] as Charman Hadson\n* [[Matt Jones (actor)|Matt Jones]] as Sheriff Dave\n* Jake Brennan as Lincoln\n* [[Mark Christopher Lawrence]] as Mr. Pederson\n* Rebecca Marshall as Emily Dopkins\n* Aiden Lovekamp as Racer Dopkins\n* Laura Stovall as Moon\n* [[Jared Breeze]] as Safety Helmet Boy\n* Angela Bullock as Rhonda\n* Nikita Ager as Patriot's Mom\n* Elizabeth Bogush as Crying Mother\n* Boni Yanagisawa as Miss Nash\n* Lauren Katz as Mrs. Gordon\n* Brian Henderson as Mr. Henderson\n* Tammie Baird as Mrs. Birk\n* Ashley Rae Miller as Tricycle Girl\n* Isabella Revel as Angela\n* Sophia Strauss as Lipstick Girl\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Crew==\n{{div col}}\n* Jonathan Milott \u2013 director\n* Cary Murnion \u2013 director\n* [[Leigh Whannell]] \u2013 screenwriter, story writer\n* [[Ian Brennan (writer)|Ian Brennan]] \u2013 screenwriter, story writer\n* Josh C.

Fortunately, the team behind ''Cooties''\u2014which includes ''Saw'' creator Leigh Whannell and ''Glee'' creator Ian Brennan\u2014manage to pit comedy and horror together in a satisfying package. With mainstay comedy faces, ''Cooties'' could reach a larger audience than other similar cultish work. It's the best play on the recent zombie craze, and while not as well-timed as ''[[Zombieland]]'', it has the potential to match that movie's success with a wide enough release.\"<ref name=\"IWReview\" />\n\nPeter Debruge of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' said, \"Circle, circle, dot, dot. A schoolyard full of anklebiters develops a genuine taste for flesh in ''Cooties'', an irreverent, off-color zom-com that seizes on the scourge of playgrounds everywhere when a spontaneous outbreak of brain-rotting, cannibalism-inducing germs erupts within a small-town elementary school.
