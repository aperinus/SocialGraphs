It is loosely based on a true story concerning the author's mother [[Molly Craig]], as well as two other [[Aboriginal Australians|Aboriginal]] girls, [[Daisy Kadibil]] and Gracie, who escape from the [[Moore River Native Settlement]], north of [[Perth]], Western Australia, to return to their Aboriginal families, after being placed there in 1931. The film follows the Aboriginal girls as they walk for nine weeks along {{convert|1500|mi|km}} of the Australian [[rabbit-proof fence]] to return to their community at [[Jigalong Community, Western Australia|Jigalong]], while being pursued by white law enforcement authorities and an [[Aboriginal tracker]].<ref name = \"film\">{{cite web |title= Rabbit-Proof Fence Title Details |publisher= National Film and Sound Archive |url= http://colsearch.nfsa.afc.gov.au/nfsa/search/display/display.w3p;adv=yes;group=;groupequals=;holdingType=;page=0;parentid=;query=Number%3A507777%20Media%3A%22FILM%22;querytype=;rec=0;resCount=10 |access-date=28 July 2007}}</ref> The film illustrates the official child removal policy that existed in Australia between approximately 1905 and 1967. Its victims now are called the \"[[Stolen Generations]]\".\n\nThe [[soundtrack]] to the film, called ''[[Long Walk Home: Music from the Rabbit-Proof Fence]]'', is by [[Peter Gabriel]]. British producer [[Jeremy Thomas]], who has a long connection with Australia, was executive producer of the film, selling it internationally through his sales arm, [[HanWay Films]]. In 2005 the British Film Institute included it in the BFI list of the 50 films you should see by the age of 14.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1931, two sisters{{snd}}14-year-old Molly and 8-year-old Daisy{{snd}}and their 10-year-old cousin Gracie live in the [[Western Australian]] town of [[Jigalong Community, Western Australia|Jigalong]]. The town lies along the northern part of one of the fences making up [[Australia]]'s [[rabbit-proof fence]] (called Number One Fence), which runs for over one thousand miles.\n\nOver a thousand miles away in [[Perth]], the official [[Chief Protector of Aborigines|Protector of Western Australian Aborigines]], [[A. O. Neville]] (called Mr. Devil by them), signs an order to relocate the three girls to the Moore River Native Settlement. The children are referred to by Neville as \"[[half-caste]]s\", because they have one white and one Aboriginal parent. Neville's reasoning is portrayed as: the Aboriginal people of Australia are a danger to themselves, and the \"half-castes\" must be bred out of existence. He plans to place the girls in a camp where they, along with all half-castes of that age range, both boys and girls, will grow up. They will then presumably become labourers and servants to white families, regarded as a \"good\" situation for them in life. Eventually if they marry, it will be to white people and thus the Aboriginal \"blood\" will diminish. As such, the three girls are forcibly taken from their families at Jigalong by a local constable, Riggs, and sent to the camp at the [[Moore River Native Settlement]], in the south west, about 90&nbsp;km (55 miles) north of Perth.\n\n[[File:Rabbit proof fence map showing route.PNG|thumb|150px|left|Map of the [[rabbit-proof fence]] showing the trip from Moore River to Jigalong]]\n\nNeville spreads word that Gracie's mother is waiting for her in the town of [[Wiluna, Western Australia|Wiluna]]. The information finds its way to an Aboriginal traveller who \"helps\" the girls. He tells Gracie about her mother and says they can get to Wiluna by train, causing her to leave the other two girls in an attempt to catch a train to Wiluna. Molly and Daisy soon walk after her and find her at a train station. They are not reunited, however, as Riggs appears and Gracie is recaptured. The betrayal is revealed by Riggs, who tells the man he will receive a [[Shilling (Australian)|shilling]] for his help. Knowing they are powerless to aid her, Molly and Daisy continue their journey. In the end, after a nine-week journey through the harsh Australian outback, having walked the 2,400&nbsp;km (1,500 miles) route along the fence, the two sisters return home and go into hiding in the desert with their mother and grandmother. Meanwhile, Neville realizes he can no longer afford the search for Molly and Daisy and decides to end it.\n\n===Epilogue===\nThe film's epilogue shows recent footage of Molly and Daisy. Molly explains that Gracie has died and she never returned to Jigalong. Molly also tells us of her own two daughters; she and they were taken from Jigalong back to Moore River. She managed to escape with one daughter, Annabelle, and once again, she walked the length of the fence back home. However, when Annabelle was three years old, she was taken away once more, and Molly never saw her again. In closing, Molly says that she and Daisy \"... are never going back to that place\".\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Everlyn Sampi]] as [[Molly Craig]]\n* Tianna Sansbury as [[Daisy Kadibil|Daisy Craig Kadibil]]\n* Laura Monaghan as Gracie Fields\n* [[David Gulpilil]] as Moodoo the Tracker\n* [[Jason Clarke]] as Constable Riggs\n* [[Kenneth Branagh]] as [[A.

Director [[Phillip Noyce]] suggested instead that the government apologize to the indigenous people affected by the removal policy.{{refn|name=Fickling}}\n\nConservative commentators such as [[Andrew Bolt]] also attacked the historical accuracy of the film. Bolt criticized the numerous disparities between the film and Pilkington Garimara's novel, a fact that angered Pilkington Garimara, who said that Bolt had misquoted her.{{refn|name=Fickling}} The academic [[Robert Manne]] in turn accused Bolt of historical denialism, and scriptwriter Christine Olsen wrote a detailed response to Bolt's claims.{{refn|name=Byrnes}}\n\nOlsen attributed the angry response among some of the public to the fact that it was based in events that were \"demonstrably true\" and well-documented.{{refn|name=Fickling}} However, the filmmaker said that the film was meant primarily as a drama rather than a political or historical statement. Noyce stated, \"If drama comes from conflict, there's no greater conflict in Australian history than the conflict between indigenous Australians and white settlers.\"{{refn|name=Fickling}}\n\nThe historian [[Keith Windschuttle]] also disputed the film's depiction of events, stating in his work ''The Fabrication of Aboriginal History'' that Molly and the two other girls had been removed for their own welfare, and that the two older girls had been sexually involved with white men. Noyce and Olsen rejected these criticisms, stating that Windschuttle's research was incomplete.<ref name=\"Maddox & Munro\">{{cite news |last1=Maddox |first1=Garry |last2=Munro |first2=Kelsey |date=15 December 2009 |title=Director, historian at odds over film |url=https://www.smh.com.au/news/entertainment/film/fighting-over-the-fence/2009/12/14/1260639169624.html |work=The Sydney Morning Herald |access-date=14 February 2018}}</ref> Pilkington Garimara denied Windschuttle's claims of sexual activity between her mother and local whites, stating that the claims were a distortion of history.<ref name=\"Perpitch\">{{cite news |last=Perpitch |first=Nicolas |title=Historian's Aboriginal claims a distortion, says author |url=https://www.theaustralian.com.au/archive/in-depth/historians-aboriginal-claims-a-distortion-says-author/story-e6frgd9f-1225810390871?sv=507bb1d5bd9ed1c40b455a21979faae6 |work=The Australian |date=15 December 2009 |location=Sydney}}</ref>\n\n===Critical response===\nThe film received positive reviews from critics.
