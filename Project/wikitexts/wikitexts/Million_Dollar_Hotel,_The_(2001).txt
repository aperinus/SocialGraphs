The film features music by [[U2]] and various musicians that was released on the soundtrack, ''[[The Million Dollar Hotel: Music from the Motion Picture]]''.\n\n==Plot==\nA group of very different people live in a hotel in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]] including the romantically involved Tom Tom (Davies) and Eloise (Milla Jovovich). The events that unfold are the result of the death of an important resident, the son ([[Tim Roth]]) of a billionaire media mogul. His father commissions an F.B.I. agent (Gibson) to look into his death.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n*[[Jeremy Davies]] as Tom Tom\n*[[Milla Jovovich]] as Eloise\n*[[Mel Gibson]] as Det.

In an October 2000 press conference in [[Sydney]], before the Australian release of the film, [[Mel Gibson]] said, \"I thought it was as boring as a dog's ass.\" He later explained:\n\n<blockquote>It was at the end of a day where I had done 6,000 interviews, some guy was ragging on the film and it just slipped out. Later, I thought 'God, why did I say that? I'm an idiot! I produced this film. I'm distributing it!' It was pretty thoughtless of me, because a lot of people worked very hard on that film, and the fact is there are moments of genius in it. The soundtrack is by U2, and it's phenomenal. So I really regret saying that. I have written a lot of apology letters about it.<ref>{{cite news | title = Mel on Men, \"Mad Max\" Musings \u2013 and More | author = Rene Rodriguez | publisher = [[Miami Herald]] | date = December 15, 2000}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Soundtrack==\n{{Main|The Million Dollar Hotel: Music from the Motion Picture}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wikiquote}}\n*{{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070223060429/http://www.milliondollarhotel.com/ |date=February 23, 2007 |title=Official web site }}\n*{{IMDb title|id=0120753|title=The Million Dollar Hotel}}\n*{{rotten-tomatoes|id=million_dollar_hotel|title=The Million Dollar Hotel}}\n*{{mojo title|id=milliondollarhotel|title=The Million Dollar Hotel}}\n\n{{Wim Wenders}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Million Dollar Hotel}}\n[[Category:2000 films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Wim Wenders]]\n[[Category:Films produced by Bruce Davey]]\n[[Category:Icon Productions films]]\n[[Category:English-language German films]]\n[[Category:German drama films]]\n[[Category:Bono]]\n[[Category:Films set in Los Angeles]]\n[[Category:Films set in hotels]]\n[[Category:2000s English-language films]]\n[[Category:American drama films]]\n[[Category:British drama films]]\n[[Category:2000s American films]]\n[[Category:2000s British films]]\n[[Category:2000s German films]]"}]}}}}
