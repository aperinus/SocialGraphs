It was directed by [[Roger Spottiswoode]] and co-written by [[Daniel Petrie Jr.]], who also served as an executive producer.\n\nFollowing the film's success, it spawned a [[Turner & Hooch (franchise)|franchise]] including a television movie sequel, and a [[legacy sequel]] [[Turner & Hooch (TV series)|television series]].\n\n[[Touchstone Pictures]] acquired the screenplay for ''Turner & Hooch'' for $1 million, which was the highest amount ever paid by Touchstone for any script at the time.<ref name=thr>{{cite news|first=Mike |last=Barnes |title=Dennis Shryack, Screenwriter on Clint Eastwood's 'The Gauntlet' and 'Pale Rider,' Dies at 80 |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/dennis-shryack-dead-pale-rider-929500 |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |date=2016-09-15 |access-date=2016-10-05}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, the plot summary should be 400-700 words. -->\nScott Turner is a police investigator in Cypress Beach, [[northern California|California]]. Bored with the lack of serious crime with his current work, Turner is set to transfer to a much better position in [[Sacramento]], leaving fellow investigator David Sutton to replace him. Turner shows David around in the three days left before his transfer, meeting with long time friend Amos Reed for a final time. The two investigators are then called to the discovery of $8,000 found at the local beach.\n\nThat same evening, Amos is murdered by an affiliate of local [[seafood]] [[magnate]] Walter Boyett when Amos reveals his suspicions of Boyett's operations. Turner is alerted to the crime the following morning, resulting in Scott taking in Hooch, Amos' pet [[Dogue de Bordeaux]] and the only witness to his murder. Scott immediately takes Hooch to the new town [[Veterinary physician|veterinarian]] Emily Carson. Scott pleads with Emily to take in Hooch as he has no experience of handling such an animal before. However, Emily insists that Hooch will be good for Scott, who lives alone.\n\nImmediately returning home, Hooch's noisy, destructive nature clashes intensely with Scott's meticulous routine and lifestyle. Scott leaves Hooch alone one night to buy dog food, only to return to a home that has been completely ransacked by Hooch unintentionally. Furious, Scott kicks Hooch out, only for him to return later with Emily's female [[collie]], Camille. Seeing an opportunity to jettison Hooch, Scott drives both Hooch and Camille back to the veterinary clinic, only to be caught by Emily as he leaves. Emily invites Scott inside, and the two proceed to continue painting the house that Emily earlier abandoned for the night. Scott leaves later on and, although he expresses his lack of interest in taking things further with Emily, it becomes clear that the two are starting to like each other.\n\nScott takes Hooch to the [[police precinct]] the next day, where a wedding occurs just across the street. Hooch recognizes the wedding [[photographer]] as Amos' killer and gives chase. The murderer is able to escape from his pursuers, but Scott is able to identify the killer as Zack Gregory, a former [[United States Marine Corps|Marine]] with several prior arrests who also fits the profile of Amos' killing (Scott had earlier speculated that Amos' murderer must have had [[Special forces|special experience]] in killing as the stab wound performed on Amos ensured total discretion). Scott also speculates that Amos wasn't murdered in a robbery attempt, but in order for Zack to cover up an illegal operation near to where he lived. This theory matches with Amos' regular complaints to Scott about the noises he heard going on at Boyett Seafood, the company that has Zack registered as an employee.\n\nCelebrating the approval to search Boyett Seafood, Scott treats Hooch but notices his refusal to eat. Scott considers this a consequence of Amos' death, the long-term owner and presumably, only companion to Hooch. Scott and Hooch start to establish a closer bond. The next day, the police search Boyett Seafood, but find no evidence of any illegal activity. With his transfer pending the following day, Scott is relieved of responsibility for the case, which is given to David by Police Chief Howard Hyde.\n\nFrustrated with reaching a dead end in the case, Scott meets with Emily, leading the two to spend the night together. In a [[eureka (word)|eureka]] moment, Scott finally realizes why the earlier search of Boyett Seafood turned up nothing\u2014instead of searching for imports, Boyett Seafood was actually exporting goods. Armed with this new lead, Scott takes Hooch back to the factory to stake-out. The following morning, David arrives upon Scott's request with the earlier recovered $8,000 from the beach. On a hunch, Scott commands Hooch to trace the scent of the money to anything he can find within the factory, ultimately returning with the exact type of bag the wad was discovered in.\n\nScott travels to the Lazy Acres Motel, the false address at which Zack Gregory was listed as a tenant. Scott interrogates the Motel owner into revealing where Zack is, only to be held up at gunpoint by him moments later. Zack orders Scott into his car to drive away, but Scott crashes the [[Cadillac]] into a concrete barrier, propelling Zack through the [[windshield]] and pinning him down by the neck, while assistance is provided by Hooch. Scott interrogates Zack, who reveals that he killed Amos, and also reveals that Walter Boyett is in on the illegal money trade going on at his factory, but is not in charge of it, to Scott's surprise.\n\nScott returns with Hooch to the factory and is unexpectedly joined by Chief Hyde. Already suspicious of Zack's earlier confession, Scott confronts Hyde, believing him to be in charge of the money laundering operation at the docks, using the gigantic ice cubes to hide the cash being sent out of the country. A gunfight soon occurs between Scott on the one hand and Hyde and Boyett on the other. Hooch is able to ambush Boyett from above, although Boyett shoots Hooch in the process.\n\nConfronting Hyde, Scott is seemingly coerced by the corrupt Police Chief to frame Boyett, who is subsequently killed by Hyde. However, Hyde knows that Scott is an entirely honest police officer, and calls his bluff. A mortally wounded Hooch manages to get up, and briefly distract Hyde long enough for Scott to kill him.\n\nScott races to Emily's clinic to tend to Hooch, who has suffered severe blood loss, and eventually dies. Later, Turner is made police chief while Sutton becomes the leading investigator. Turner also marries Emily, with the couple now caring for Camille and her litter of puppies, one of whom looks and acts exactly like Hooch.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Tom Hanks]] as Detective Scott Turner \n* Beasley the Dog as Hooch \n* [[Mare Winningham]] as Dr. Emily Carson \n* [[Craig T.

They actually make a good team, and are disappointed when they have to disband. Another episode has Turk offended at JD's assumption that Turner and Hooch was an interracial buddy movie, an assumption made based on the aforementioned Hooch. In the second season of ''[[Castle (TV series)|Castle]]'', Beckett and Castle compare themselves to Turner and Hooch, with Castle being Hooch. This comparison returned in the Castle season 7 episode \"Kill Switch\".\n\nDuring an appearance on ''[[Late Night with Conan O'Brien]]'', O'Brien gave Tom Hanks a preserved dog skeleton, claiming it was his old friend Hooch. As one of O'Brien's first guests on ''[[The Tonight Show]]'', Hanks improvised a song from an alleged ''Turner & Hooch'' stage musical. During the [[78th Academy Awards|2006 Academy Awards]], Tom Hanks played in a sketch about acceptance speeches that ran on too long.
