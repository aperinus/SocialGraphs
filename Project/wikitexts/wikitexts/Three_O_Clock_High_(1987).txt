The script, about a meek high schooler who is forced into a fight with a volatile new transfer student, is based on the high school experiences of screenwriters [[Richard Christian Matheson]] and Thomas Szollosi. It was shot in [[Ogden, Utah]].\n\n==Plot==\n<!---not every incident in a film needs to be summarized or detailed. Wikipedia guideline is 400-700 words for movie summaries-->\nMeek high school student Jerry Mitchell and his sister Brei have the house to themselves while their parents are on vacation. The students this morning are gossiping about the new student Buddy Revell, a violent delinquent who has just transferred to Weaver from a [[continuation high school]].\n\nJerry's first hour is spent at the school newspaper, where his best friend, Vincent Costello, is the editor. Their journalism teacher has the idea of doing an article about Buddy to welcome the \"new kid\", and she assigns Jerry to do an interview. Jerry sees Buddy in the restroom and clumsily attempts to introduce himself but realizes he is only making Buddy angry. He tells Buddy to disregard the interview request, and gives Buddy a friendly tap on the arm. Buddy, who does not like to be touched, responds by tossing Jerry against a wall and states the pair will fight outside the school at 3:00 P.M. Buddy also tells Jerry that running away or reporting the incident to a teacher will only make the situation worse.\n\nWith little more than six hours to go, Jerry tries different strategies to avoid the fight. Trying to reason with Buddy doesn't work. Vincent suggests that he plant a [[switchblade]] in Buddy's locker to get him kicked out of school; Brei advises him to simply skip school, but when Jerry tries to leave, he finds the switchblade he planted now stuck in his car's steering wheel, and his ignition wires cut. Trying to run, Jerry is caught by overzealous school security guard, Duke, who finds the switchblade and takes Jerry to the office of Mr. Dolinski, the Dean of Discipline. Doliniski warns Jerry he is under suspicion. \n\nJerry makes several other attempts to avoid the fight. All attempts fail, and the clock continues to tick down. Ultimately Buddy accepts cash Jerry stole from the school store in exchange for calling off the fight, but declares Jerry is a coward. Now seized with self-loathing and anger, Jerry decides to confront Buddy, and demands the money back. When Buddy refuses, Jerry insists that he is no coward and declares that their fight is back on.\n\nThe clock finally reaches the appointed hour, and the fight begins with hundreds of eager students awaiting the fight outside the school.  Jerry, though out-matched, stands his ground while being knocked down. His sister picks up Buddy's dropped [[brass knuckles]] and slips them to Jerry. He uses them in a desperate move to stun and knock-out Buddy; during the excitement that follows, Buddy vanishes.\n\nThe next day, many students show their admiration and support to Jerry for such a great fight. They begin buying individual sheets of paper for $1 from the school store to help Jerry make up the store's missing cash. Buddy suddenly shows up, silencing the crowd. He openly returns the cash to Jerry, begrudgingly showing his respect. Weaver High is now filled with new gossip, as Jerry replaces Buddy as the school's hot discussion topic, with rumors having a wide and humorous range from the actual truth.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Casey Siemaszko]] as Jerry Mitchell\n* [[Anne Ryan (actress)|Anne Ryan]] as Franny Perrins\n* [[Richard Tyson]] as Buddy Revell\n* Jonathan Wise as Vincent Costello\n* [[Stacey Glick]] as Brei Mitchell\n* [[Jeffrey Tambor]] as Mr. Rice\n* [[Philip Baker Hall]] as Detective Mulvahill\n* [[John P.
