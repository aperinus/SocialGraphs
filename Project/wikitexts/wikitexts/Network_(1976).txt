The two commiserate and drunkenly lament the state of their industry. The following night, Beale announces on live television that he will commit suicide on next Tuesday's broadcast. UBS immediately tries to fire him after this incident, but Schumacher intervenes so that Beale can have a dignified farewell. Beale promises to apologize for his outburst, but once on the air, he launches into a rant about life being \"bullshit.\" Beale's outburst causes ratings to spike, and much to Schumacher's dismay, the UBS upper echelons decide to exploit the situation rather than downplay it. When Beale's ratings seem to have topped out, programming chief Diana Christensen reaches out to Schumacher with an offer to help \"develop\" the show. He declines the professional proposal, but accepts a more personal pitch from Christensen and the two begin an affair.\n\nWhen Schumacher decides to end Beale's \"angry man\" format, Christensen persuades her boss, Frank Hackett, to slot the evening news show under the entertainment programming division banner so she can develop it. Hackett agrees, bullying the UBS executives to consent and fire Schumacher. In one impassioned diatribe, Beale galvanizes the nation, persuading viewers to shout \"I'm as mad as hell, and I'm not going to take this anymore!\" from their windows. Soon afterward, Beale is hosting a new program called ''The Howard Beale Show'', top-billed as \"the mad prophet of the airwaves\". Ultimately, the show becomes the most highly rated program on television, and Beale finds new celebrity preaching his angry message in front of a live studio audience that, on cue, chants his signature catchphrase ''en masse'': \"We're as mad as hell, and we're not going to take this anymore!\" Schumacher and Christensen's romance withers as the show flourishes, but in the flush of high ratings, the two ultimately find their way back together, and Schumacher separates from his wife of over 25 years for Christensen.\n\nChristensen, seeking just one hit show, cuts a deal with a band of terrorists called the Ecumenical Liberation Army (ELA) for a new docudrama series, ''The [[Mao Zedong|Mao Tse-Tung]] Hour,'' for the upcoming fall season, for which the ELA will provide exclusive footage of their activities. Her liaison, [[Communist Party USA]] representative Laureen Hobbs, initially objects to the promotion of violent terrorism, believing Americans are \"not yet ready for open revolt\" and that the ELA will harm left-wing causes in America, but relents after Christensen promises her total editorial control of the weekly [[Prime time|prime-time]] TV program.\n\nWhen Beale discovers that Communications Corporation of America (CCA), the [[Conglomerate (company)|conglomerate]] parent of UBS, will be bought out by an even larger [[Saudi Arabia|Saudi]] conglomerate, he launches an on-screen tirade against the deal and urges viewers to pressure the [[White House]] to stop it. This panics top network brass because UBS's debt load has made the merger essential for its survival. Beale meets with CCA chairman Arthur Jensen, who explicates his own \"corporate cosmology\" to Beale, describing the inter-relatedness of the participants in the international economy and the illusory nature of nationality distinctions. Jensen persuades Beale to abandon his [[Populism|populist]] message and preach ''his'' new \"evangel\". Christensen's fanatical devotion to her job and emotional emptiness ultimately drive Schumacher away and back to his wife, and he warns his former lover that she will self-destruct if she continues running her career at its current pace.\n\nAudiences find Beale's new sermons on the dehumanization of society depressing and ratings start to slip, yet Jensen will not allow UBS to fire Beale, despite protestations from Hackett, who fears a loss of ad revenue, and Hobbs, who fears that Beale's slipping ratings will harm viewer numbers for ''The Mao Tse-Tung Hour''. Seeing its two-for-the-price-of-one value\u2014solving the Beale problem plus sparking a boost in season-opener ratings\u2014Christensen, Hackett, and the other executives decide to hire the ELA to assassinate Beale on the air. The assassination succeeds, putting an end to ''The Howard Beale Show'' and kicking off a second season of ''The Mao Tse-Tung Hour''; a [[Voice-over|voiceover]] proclaims, \"This was the story of Howard Beale: the first known instance of a man who was killed because he had lousy ratings.\"\n\n== Cast ==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Faye Dunaway]] as Diana Christensen\n* [[William Holden]] as Max Schumacher\n* [[Peter Finch]] as [[Howard Beale (Network)|Howard Beale]]\n* [[Robert Duvall]] as Frank Hackett\n* [[Wesley Addy]] as Nelson Chaney\n* [[Ned Beatty]] as Arthur Jensen\n* [[Beatrice Straight]] as Louise Schumacher\n* [[Jordan Charney]] as Harry Hunter\n* [[William Prince (actor)|William Prince]] as Edward Ruddy\n* [[Lane Smith]] as Robert McDonough\n* [[Marlene Warfield]] as Laureen Hobbs\n* [[Conchata Ferrell]] as Barbara Schlesinger\n* Carolyn Krigbaum as Max's secretary\n* [[Arthur Burghardt]] as the Great Ahmed Kahn\n* [[Cindy Grover]] as Caroline Schumacher\n* [[Darryl Hickman]] as Bill Herron\n* [[Ken Kercheval]] as Merrill Grant\n* [[Kathy Cronkite]] as Mary Ann Gifford\n* Ed Crowley as Joe Donnelly\n* [[Lee Richardson (actor)|Lee Richardson]] as the Narrator (voice)\n*  [[Paul Jenkins (actor)|Paul Jenkins]] as TV Stage Manager\n* [[Kenneth Kimmins]] as Associate Producer\n* Lynn Klugman as TV Production Assistant\n* [[Russ Petranto]] as TV Associate Director\n* Michael Lipton as Tommy Pellegrino\n* Pirie MacDonald as Herb Thackeray\n}}\n\n== Production ==\n''Network'' came only two years after the first on-screen suicide in television history, of television news reporter [[Christine Chubbuck]] in Sarasota, Florida.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.allbusiness.com/humanities-social-science/visual-performing-arts/16227997-1.html|publisher=dead link |title=Television will eat itself in Sidney Lumet's searing satire|date=October 1, 2008}} {{dead link|date=September 2018}}</ref> The anchorwoman was suffering from depression and loneliness, was often emotionally distant from her co-workers, and shot herself on camera as stunned viewers watched on July 15, 1974.\n\nChayefsky used the idea of a live death as his film's terminating focal point, to say later in an interview, \"Television will do anything for a rating... anything!\" &nbsp;However, [[David Itzkoff|Dave Itzkoff]]'s book (''Mad as Hell: The Making of Network and the Fateful Vision of the Angriest Man in Movies'') allows that whether Chayefsky was inspired by the Chubbuck case remains unclear, that Chayefsky's screenplay notes on the week of the live death have nothing about the incident in them, and grants it is an eerie parallel.

Despite this recent legal action, Chayefsky and Gottfried signed a deal with UA to finance ''Network'', until UA found the subject matter too controversial and backed out.\n\nUndeterred, Chayefsky and Gottfried shopped the script around to other studios, and eventually found an interested party in [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]. Soon afterward, United Artists reversed itself and looked to co-finance the film with MGM, since the latter had an ongoing distribution arrangement with UA in North America. Since MGM agreed to let UA back on board, the former (through United Artists as per the arrangement) controlled North American/Caribbean rights, with UA opting for overseas distribution.\n\n=== Casting ===\nIn his notes, Chayefsky jotted down his ideas about casting. For Howard Beale, who would eventually be played by [[Peter Finch]], he envisioned [[Henry Fonda]], [[Cary Grant]], [[James Stewart]] and [[Paul Newman]]. He went so far as to write Newman, telling him that \"You and a very small handful of other actors are the only ones I can think of with the range for this part.\" Lumet wanted Fonda, with whom he had worked several times, but Fonda declined the role, finding it too \"hysterical\" for his taste. Stewart also found the script unsuitable, objecting to the strong language. Early consideration was given to real-life newscasters [[Walter Cronkite]] and [[John Chancellor]], but neither was open to the idea. Although not mentioned in Chayefsky's notes, [[George C. Scott]], [[Glenn Ford]] and [[William Holden]] reportedly also turned down the opportunity to play Beale, with Holden instead playing Max Schumacher: For that role, Chayefsky had initially listed [[Walter Matthau]] and [[Gene Hackman]]. Ford was under consideration for this part as well, and was said to be one of two final contenders. Holden finally got the edge because of his recent box-office success with ''[[The Towering Inferno]]''.<ref>[http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/342/Network/articles.html Network] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180201100743/http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/342/Network/articles.html |date=February 1, 2018 }} TCM.

An actor of considerable prominence, Finch reportedly responded, \"Bugger pride. Put the script in the mail.\" Immediately realizing that the role was a plum, he even agreed to pay his own fare to New York for a screen test. He prepared for the audition by listening to hours of broadcasts by American newscasters, and by weeks of reading the international editions of ''The New York Times'' and the ''Herald Tribune'' into a tape recorder, then listening to playbacks with a critical ear. Gottfried recalled that Finch \"was nervous as hell at that first meeting over lunch and just like a kid auditioning. Once we'd heard him, Sidney Lumet, Paddy, and I were ecstatic because we knew it was a hell of a part to cast.\" Finch cinched the deal with Lumet by playing him the tapes of his newspaper readings.<ref>{{cite book |first= Trader |last=Faulkner |year= 1979 |title= Peter Finch: A Biography |publisher=Angus & Robertson |isbn=9780207958311 }}</ref>\n\n[[Faye Dunaway]] wanted [[Robert Mitchum]] to play Max Schumacher, but Lumet refused, believing that Mitchum wasn't sufficiently urbane.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://home.sprintmail.com/~sknolle/mitchum/not.html |title=Robert Mitchum: Not Starring ... |access-date=July 1, 2018 |archive-date=November 7, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171107045353/http://home.sprintmail.com/~sknolle/mitchum/not.html |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite book | first=Faye| last=Dunaway | title=Looking for Gatsby | publisher=Pocket Books | year=1995| isbn=0-671-67526-5 }}</ref>\n\nFor the role of Diana Christensen, Chayefsky thought of [[Candice Bergen]], [[Ellen Burstyn]], and [[Natalie Wood]], while the studio suggested [[Jane Fonda]], with alternate candidates [[Kay Lenz]], [[Diane Keaton]], [[Marsha Mason]] and [[Jill Clayburgh]]. Lumet wanted to cast [[Vanessa Redgrave]] in the film, but Chayefsky did not want her. Lumet argued that he thought she was the greatest English-speaking actress in the world, while Chayefsky, a [[Jewish fundamentalism|proud Jew]] and [[Zionism|supporter of Israel]], objected on the basis of her support of the [[Palestine Liberation Organization|PLO]].

According to biographer Bob Thomas, Holden had been incensed by Dunaway's behavior during the filming of the disaster epic, especially her habit of leaving him fuming on the set while she attended to her hair, makeup and telephone calls. One day, after a two-hour wait, Holden reportedly grabbed Dunaway by the shoulders, pushed her against a soundstage wall and snapped, \"You do that to me once more, and I'll push you through that wall!\"{{Citation needed|date=March 2022}}\n\nLumet and cinematographer [[Owen Roizman]] worked out a complicated lighting scheme that in Lumet's words would \"corrupt the camera\". Lumet recalled: \"We started with an almost naturalistic look. For the first scene between Peter Finch and Bill Holden, on Sixth Avenue at night, we added only enough light to get an exposure. As the movie progressed, camera setups became more rigid, more formal. The lighting became more and more artificial. The next-to-final scene\u2014where Faye Dunaway, Robert Duvall, and the three network gray suits decide to kill Peter Finch\u2014is lit like a commercial.
