After the short film's success, Sandberg announced a film adaptation based on his short film. [[Principal photography]] for the film began in June 2015 in\u00a0[[Los Angeles]]. Filming was completed on August 5, 2015.\n\nThe film had its world premiere at the [[Los Angeles Film Festival]] on June 8, 2016, and was released in the United States and Canada on July 22, 2016, by [[Warner Bros.]] The film received positive reviews from critics, with many praising the direction, screenplay, acting, cinematography and musical score, and grossed $148{{nbsp}}million against a budget of $4.9{{nbsp}}million. A sequel is in development.\n\n== Plot ==\nIn a [[textile]] factory during closing hours, an employee named Esther encounters a silhouette of a strange woman with claw-like hands when the lights are off, but cannot see it when the lights are on. After she leaves, her boss Paul encounters the woman and tries to run away, but he is killed.\n\nSome time later, Paul's son, Martin, witness his mother, Sophie, talking to something in the dark. As Martin goes back to bed, he notices a strange figure in the shadow behind Sophie, and locks himself in his bedroom out of fear. Martin begins to have trouble with staying awake at school. The nurse is unable to get in touch with Sophie to inform her of this, so Paul's stepdaughter (Martin's older half-sibling) Rebecca is called into the school nurse's office. A [[Child Protective Services]] agent questions Rebecca about Martin's living conditions, and Rebecca tells the official that Sophie has depression and is taking [[antidepressants]].\n\nMartin tells his sister that their mother has been talking to a woman named \"Diana\". Rebecca assures him that Diana is not real, and that she had also heard their mother talk to the imaginary girl when she was a child. Rebecca gets into an argument with Sophie when she realizes her mother is not taking her medication. Sophie tells Rebecca she has no right to lecture her since she also abandoned her like Rebecca's father. Questioning her mother's sanity, Rebecca takes Martin to her apartment, much to Sophie's despair. That night, Rebecca is woken by the same shadowed woman that killed Paul. She narrowly escapes an attack when she turns the lights on, making the woman disappear. The next morning, Rebecca notices that the name \"Diana\" has been scratched into her floor, along with a scratch drawing of a stick figure. She remembers finding the same name and drawing as a child and realizes Diana is real.\n\nRebecca finds a box of medical records and research in Paul's office. His findings reveal that her mother was admitted to a mental hospital as a child. While there, she befriended a young patient named Diana. Diana suffered from a severe skin condition that meant she could not go out in sunlight. It was believed that she was evil and was able to \"get into people's heads\" since Diana's father committed suicide after Diana influenced him to kill himself. In the end, Diana was accidentally killed by the hospital staff when they tried an experimental surgery on her under intense light. Sophie has a conversation with Martin, who was taken back to her mother by the CPS agent, and she decides to allow Martin to meet Diana after turning the light off. However, Martin is fearful and runs away from them.\n\nRebecca, her boyfriend Bret, and Martin stage an intervention with Sophie about how Sophie is letting Diana haunt them. Sophie becomes irate but secretly asks Rebecca for help, as Diana will not let Sophie go. The group stays the night at Sophie's, intending to get her help in the morning. To avoid an attack from Diana during the night, they rig the house to be as brightly lit as possible. This proves useless when Diana cuts the power to the neighborhood. She traps Rebecca and Martin in the basement and attempts to kill Bret. Despite being injured, Bret escapes by shining the headlight of his car and drives away. In the basement, Martin and Rebecca find a black-light; when Rebecca is using it, she clearly sees Diana with it, but realizes it is not powerful enough to ward her off.\n\nBret returns with two police officers. When the officers free Martin and Rebecca from the basement, they also see the shadow of Diana and try to go after her, but she kills them. Rebecca and Martin go out, but Martin insists on getting their mom out as well. Rebecca goes back alone for her mother. As she climbs the stairs, Diana tells Rebecca that she killed Rebecca's father years ago. As Diana prepares to kill her, Sophie appears with a gun from one of the dead officers. Sophie has realized she is the tether for Diana to exist in the real world and kills herself to save Rebecca. As Sophie's body falls, Diana vanishes from existence.\n\nAfter the long night, Bret comforts Martin and Rebecca in an ambulance outside the house, assuring them that Diana is truly gone.\n\n== Cast ==\n<!--- Cast order and roles per closing credits scroll --->\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Teresa Palmer]] as Rebecca\n* [[Gabriel Bateman]] as Martin, Rebecca's half-brother\n* [[Alexander DiPersia]] as Bret, Rebecca's boyfriend\n* [[Billy Burke (actor)|Billy Burke]] as Paul, Rebecca's step-father\n* [[Maria Bello]] as Sophie, Rebecca and Martin's mother\n* Alicia Vela-Bailey as [[Diana Walter|Diana]], a [[malevolent spirit]] and Sophie's friend\n* [[Andi Osho]] as Emma, a social worker\n* Rolando Boyce as Brian Andrews\n* Maria Russell as Officer Gomez\n* Elizabeth Pan as Nurse\n* [[Lotta Losten]] as Esther, Paul's assistant\n* [[Amiah Miller (actress)|Amiah Miller]] as young Rebecca \n* [[Ava Cantrell]] as teen Diana\n* [[Emily Alyn Lind]] as teen Sophie\n}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nSandberg, along with his wife  Lotta Losten, created the initial short film for a film competition. Although the film did not win the competition, the short soon went viral, leading to Sandberg to be contacted by several agents, to the point where he had to develop a [[spreadsheet]] to keep track of them all.<ref name=\"Airbnbdaily\">{{cite web|last1=Wixson|first1=Heather|title=LIGHTS OUT Interview: Director David F.

Once in Hollywood the two were unable to get an apartment due to not having a US credit score, forcing them to rent [[Airbnb]] on a monthly basis.<ref name=\"Airbnbdaily\"/>\n\n===Casting===\nIn June 2015, [[Gabriel Bateman]] and [[Teresa Palmer]] were cast in the film as the child and teenager leads. In that same month, [[Maria Bello]] was cast in the film as the mother of Bateman and Palmer's characters, alongside [[Alexander DiPersia]] as the boyfriend of Palmer's character, [[Billy Burke (actor)|Billy Burke]] as the stepfather of Palmer's character and father of Bateman's character, and Alicia Vela-Bailey as the main antagonist [[Diana (Lights Out)|Diana]] were also starring it.<ref>{{cite news|last1=McNary|first1=Dave|title=Gabriel Bateman to Star in James Wan's 'Lights Out'|url=https://variety.com/2015/film/news/gabriel-bateman-james-wan-lights-out-1201521298/|access-date=July 2, 2015|work=variety.com|date=June 17, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Busch|first1=Anita|title=Teresa Palmer To Star In James Wan's 'Lights Out' For Atomic Monster, New Line|url=https://deadline.com/2015/06/teresa-palmer-lights-out-james-wan-atomic-monster-1201459410/|access-date=July 2, 2015|work=deadline.com|date=June 27, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=On the Set for 6/29/15: Justin Lin Rolls Cameras on 'Star Trek Beyond', Emilia Clarke Wraps 'Me Before You'|url=http://www.ssninsider.com/on-the-set-for-62915-justin-lin-rolls-cameras-on-star-trek-beyond-emilia-clarke-wraps-me-before-you/|access-date=July 2, 2015|work=ssninsider.com|date=June 29, 2015|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150630233856/http://www.ssninsider.com/on-the-set-for-62915-justin-lin-rolls-cameras-on-star-trek-beyond-emilia-clarke-wraps-me-before-you/|archive-date=June 30, 2015}}</ref><ref name=June2015HellHorror>{{cite news|title=Teresa Palmer Joins LIGHTS OUT with James Wan|url=https://hellhorror.com/article/8928/Teresa-Palmer-Joins-LIGHTS-OUT-with-James-Wan.html|access-date=July 2, 2015|work=hellhorror.com|date= June 29, 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Filming===\nPrincipal photography for the film began in June 2015 in [[Los Angeles]].

Sandberg said \"Whenever she's in frame with another character, it's basically just a split screen. So you shoot it with her and without her. You turn the camera on with her, you turn it off and she walks off, and then you turn it on again. It's super simple, actually.\"  Sandberg also made a list of what he called the \"light gags\", or different ways to create light sources from flashlights to cell phones and gunfire. In the scene when Diana appears in Rebecca's room, James Wan suggested replacing passing car headlights in an early treatment with the flashing neon sign that appears in the final film.<ref name=\"av club\"/>\n\nSandberg originally based the character of Rebecca on a real girl that he knew who was suffering from depression, and who was engaging in [[self-harm]], which is why Rebecca has scars on her arms, but the development of the film made it less about depression and more of a ghost story in which Diana would have been the real person who died and became a ghost. Wan came up with the idea of making Diana the ghost. Rebecca's boyfriend was also given a twist of being a rocker, but is actually committed and responsible, even driving a safe car like a Volvo. Another twist Sandberg liked was making the imaginary friend for the mother rather than the trope of having the friend be for the child.<ref name=\"av club\"/>\n\n===Suicide concerns and ending===\nAfter hearing concerns from critics that the ending of the film was promoting suicide, Sandberg interviewed with ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' where he said he was distressed about that idea, and wanted to explain his position. He said that he originally wanted to make a film about depression, as he has also suffered from it, and that one of his friends had committed suicide. Diana was not a ghost back then, but during the development of the film, it became more of a horror film. It still retained some themes about depression and mental illness. He had originally shot a second ending to the film in which Martin becomes depressed and Diana comes back one more time before she is killed. Test audiences concluded that Sophie's sacrifice would have been in vain.<ref name=\"av club\">{{cite web|url=https://avclub.com/article/lights-out-director-david-sandberg-defends-ending--240341|title=Lights Out director David Sandberg defends the ending of his horror hit|date=July 30, 2016|website=[[The A.V.
