It is based on the 1883 novel ''[[The Adventures of Pinocchio]]'' by [[Carlo Collodi]], with Benigni portraying [[Pinocchio]]. Filming took place in Italy and [[Kalkara]], [[Malta]]. It was dedicated to costume and production designer [[Danilo Donati]], who died on 1 December 2001.\n\nThe film was released in Italy on 11 October 2002 by Medusa Distribuzione, which was met with mixed reviews.<ref name=guardian/> It received an English-language dub in the United States in December 2002, released by [[Miramax|Miramax Films]]; this version was critically panned. ''Pinocchio'' was [[List of Italian submissions for the Academy Award for Best International Feature Film|selected]] as the Italian entry for the [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film|Best Foreign Language Film]] at the [[75th Academy Awards]], but it was not nominated.\n\n==Plot==\nA magical log falls off a wagon, stopping at [[Geppetto]]'s door. The wood carver creates a puppet from the log and names it Pinocchio. Pinocchio comes to life and runs away in the streets, turning the town upside down. The carpenter is blamed and taken to prison by the [[carabinieri]], while Pinocchio escapes.\n\nBack home, a [[Talking Cricket]] scolds him for his behavior; this annoys Pinocchio, so he tries to hit him with a hammer. Tired and hungry, Pinocchio promises to his father that he will go to school and study. Geppetto returns home from prison and sold his only coat to buy schoolbooks for him, however the naughty puppet goes on several adventures, dreading school.\n\nJoining a puppet theater, Pinocchio is almost eaten by the giant puppet master [[Mangiafuoco]]. Lying to get out of the situation, he is given five gold coins. He then meets [[The Fox and the Cat]], who trick him out of his money, telling him to plant it to grow a 'money tree' in the Miracle Meadow near the town of \"Grab-A-Dimwit\". A [[The Fairy with Turquoise Hair|Blue Fairy]] encourages Pinocchio to give up his obnoxious ways, and saves him from being hanged. After being examined by the Owl, the Crow, and the Talking Cricket, Pinocchio experiences the side-effect of his lying. She gives Pinocchio medicine and when he refuses it, coffin-bearing rabbits appear, so he immediately takes it. \n\nThe Fox and Cat steal the gold coins Pinocchio buried. The Talking Cricket informs Pinocchio about it. Pinocchio tells the judges about the Fox and Cat's theft, but was sentenced to five years in jail for foolishness. While there, Pinocchio meets [[Candlewick (Pinocchio character)|Lucignolo]], a thief that stole 29 lollipops from a candy shop (though the judges are shown eating them) who is being released. Four months later, during the celebration of the King's son's birth, Pinocchio is set free. He stumbles across the grave of the Blue Fairy, who supposedly died of grief because of his antics. \n\nA [[Columbidae|dove]] tells Pinocchio his father was heading out to sea to look for him. Pinocchio arrives at the shore, finding Geppetto on his ship and been knocked out by the waves. Pinocchio nearly drowns trying to save his father, then washes up by a city where he meets the Blue Fairy again. \n\nOn his way to school, a kid throws a book at him, he ducks, and it hits Eugenio, who loses consciousness. Pinocchio is blamed for the crime. Upon nearing the Blue Fairy's house he escapes, ending up in a grape farmer's trap. Pinocchio is freed by Lucignolo and returns to the Blue Fairy's home. \n\nThe next day, Lucignolo convinces Pinocchio to join him on a trip to '[[Land of Toys|Fun Forever Land]]'. When there, the Cricket tries to warn them all they will turn into donkeys if they do not leave and continue being bad. Pinocchio soon becomes a donkey and is sold to a circus [[Ringmaster (circus)|ringmaster]].\n\nDuring his performance, Pinocchio gets hurt and is thrown into the sea, where he instantly returns to normal and is swallowed by a [[The Terrible Dogfish|giant shark]] which coincidentally has also swallowed Geppetto. They escape together.\n\nPinocchio takes Geppetto to a farm to help him recover by helping out a farmer to get his father better, inside the farmer's paddock he sees a sick donkey who he immediately recognize as Lucignolo, but his friend tragically dies from working too hard.\n\nRewarding his efforts to strive for moral prudence, the Blue Fairy transforms him into a real boy. With his wish granted, he and his father sees his old puppet body in the corner of the house and sets off his actual first day of school.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Roberto Benigni Nicoletta Braschi.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Roberto Benigni]] and his wife [[Nicoletta Braschi]] starred as Pinocchio and the Blue Fairy respectively.
