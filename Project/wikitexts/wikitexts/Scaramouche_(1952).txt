It was directed by [[George Sidney]] and produced by [[Carey Wilson (writer)|Carey Wilson]] from a screenplay by [[Ronald Millar]] and [[George Froeschel]]. The original music score was composed by [[Victor Young]] and the cinematography by [[Charles Rosher]].\n\n==Plot==\nIn France just prior to the [[French Revolution]], Queen [[Marie Antoinette]] asks her cousin Noel, the Marquis de Maynes, to uncover the identity of \"Marcus Brutus\", a dangerous [[pamphleteer]] rousing hatred of the aristocracy. She also pressures de Maynes to marry to preserve his line, and at his request for her to choose his bride is introduced to Aline de Gavrilac, one of the Queen's wards.\n\nMeanwhile, Andr\u00e9 Moreau, a nobleman's bastard, kidnaps his beloved Lenore to keep her from marrying another man. After the two decide to get married, Moreau learns that his best man, Philippe de Valmorin is in hiding for participating in the revolution and distributing pamphlets under the allonym Marcus Brutus. Moreau tells de Valmorin to leave Paris, taking Lenore with him. At the same time, Moreau visits his lawyer, Fabien, and forcefully threatens him to disclose the name of his father in order to learn why he has stopped sending an allowance. When Moreau and de Valmorin rendezvous in the woods, it is without Lenore, who, not knowing the identity or motive of de Valmorin, escaped the carriage. They continue on their journey to meet Moreau's father, who is revealed to be the Comte de Gavrillac. Moreau runs into Aline de Gavrillac when her carriage breaks down in the road. They are strongly attracted to each other, but Moreau's ardor suddenly cools when he learns that she is his half-sister. He hides that information from her, partly because of sympathy when they both enter the House of Gavrillac to see that the Comte has died.\n\nBy chance, de Maynes encounters de Valmorin. A master swordsman, de Maynes provokes de Valmorin into a duel, then toys with his inexperienced opponent before finally killing him. Enraged, Moreau attacks, but does no better than his dead friend. After de Maynes easily disarms him several times, Moreau chooses discretion over valor and flees for his life, vowing to kill de Maynes the same way he slew de Valmorin.\n\nChased by de Maynes' henchmen, led by the Chevalier de Chabrillaine, Moreau hides out in the ''[[commedia dell'arte]]'' troupe in which Lenore performs. Forced to disguise himself as the character [[Scaramuccia|Scaramouche]], he discovers a hidden talent as a performer. Burning for revenge, Moreau seeks out de Maynes' fencing instructor, Doutreval of Dijon, and trains diligently in secret for weeks, while also performing with the troupe. However, de Maynes appears during one such training session, and they fight for a second time. Moreau is still overmatched, and is saved only by Aline's unexpected arrival, enabling Moreau to escape (with Doutreval's assistance).\n\nHe decides to seek out Doutreval's teacher, Perigore of Paris, the man who according to Doutreval \"is the master of all swordsmen.\" Moreau takes the troupe to Paris for that purpose. There, Dr. Dubuque, a deputy of the new [[National Assembly (French Revolution)|National Assembly]], seeks his help. The aristocrats in the assembly are systematically killing off the deputies representing the common people by provoking them into duels. Moreau is not interested, until Dubuque mentions that de Maynes is one of the duelists; then he eagerly accepts the seat of a deceased deputy. Each day, he shows up at the assembly to challenge de Maynes, only to find his enemy absent on trivial but official duties, arranged by Aline and Lenore working together to protect the man they both love. However, other nobles in the National Assembly are eager to fight the newcomer, challenging him on a daily basis. Moreau wins every duel; the Chevalier de Chabrillaine barely escapes with his life.\n\nIn the meantime, de Maynes becomes engaged to Aline. Overhearing de Maynes' intention to confront Moreau that night, Aline persuades him to take her out instead. At the suggestion of de Chabrillaine, they attend a performance of the De Binet Troupe, where Andre seizes his opportunity for revenge. The two men engage in a prolonged duel (reputedly the longest in screen history at about seven minutes) that ranges throughout the theater and finally back onto the stage itself. At the end, Moreau has de Maynes at his mercy, helpless as Philippe de Valmorin had been, but something he cannot explain stays his hand. Moreau stalks off, leaving de Maynes bloodied but alive.\n\nLater, Moreau learns from Philippe's father that his father is not the Comte de Gavrillac, but rather the old Marquis de Maynes, the Comte de Gavrillac's friend; Noel, the man he could not kill, is his half-brother. He then realizes that he is not related to Aline after all, so they can be married. Lenore consoles herself with a certain [[Napoleon I of France|Corsican officer]].\n\n==Cast==\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Stewart Granger]] as Andre Moreau\n* [[Eleanor Parker]] as Lenore\n* [[Janet Leigh]] as Aline de Gavrillac de Bourbon\n* [[Mel Ferrer]] as Noel, Marquis de Maynes\n* [[Henry Wilcoxon]] as Chevalier de Chabrillaine\n* [[Nina Foch]] as [[Marie Antoinette]]\n* [[Richard Anderson]] as Philippe de Valmorin\n* [[Robert Coote]] as Gaston Binet\n* [[Lewis Stone]] as Georges de Valmorin, Philippe's father and Andre's foster father\n* [[Elisabeth Risdon]] as Isabelle de Valmorin, Philippe's mother\n* [[Howard Freeman]] as Michael Vanneau\n* Curtis Cooksey as Lawyer Fabian\n* [[John Dehner]] as Doutreval of Dijon\n* [[John Litel]] as Dr. Dubuque\n* Owen McGiveney as Punchinello\n{{Div col end}}\n\n===Cast notes===\nLewis Stone also played the villain, the Marquis de la Tour d'Azyr, in the [[Scaramouche (1923 film)|1923 silent version]].\n\n==Production==\n\n===Development===\nThe studio planned to adapt the novel in late 1938, with production set to commence in early 1939, though pre-production did not start until 1950.<ref name=\"notes\" />\n\nInitially, the film was meant to be an [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]] musical starring [[Gene Kelly]], with [[Ava Gardner]] as Lenore and [[Elizabeth Taylor]] co-starring as Aline before it was changed to more of a swashbuckling adventure film.<ref name=\"article\">{{cite web |url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/2053/Scaramouche/articles.html |title=Scaramouche: Overview Article |accessdate=2011-07-08|work=[[Turner Classic Movies]]}}</ref> Their commitments to the film were confirmed in early 1951.<ref name=\"notes\">{{cite web |url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/2053/Scaramouche/notes.html |title=Notes for Scaramouche (1952) |accessdate=2011-07-08|work=[[Turner Classic Movies]]}}</ref> At one point, other than Kelly, [[Fernando Lamas]] and [[Ricardo Montalb\u00e1n]] were also considered for the lead.<ref name=\"notes\" />\n\n\"I always felt that ''Scaramouche'' should have been a musical\", said George Sidney. \"It would have needed the most crafty score but it could have been terribly exciting.\"<ref name=\"george\">{{cite book|last=Davis|first=Ronald L.|page=[https://archive.org/details/justmakingmovies00davi/page/76 76]|title=Just Making Movies|url=https://archive.org/details/justmakingmovies00davi|url-access=registration|year=2005|publisher=University Press of Mississippi|isbn=9781578066902 }}</ref>\n\nHowever, when [[Stewart Granger]] was contracted by the studio after his success in ''[[King Solomon's Mines]]'', one of his stipulations was that he star in the then-upcoming ''Scaramouche'' project.<ref name=\"article\" /><ref>{{Cite news|title='FRANCIS' STORIES ARE BOUGHT BY U.-I|author=THOMAS F BRADY|date=May 17, 1950|work=New York Times|id={{ProQuest|111628905}}}}</ref>\n\n[[Ava Gardner]] was announced as Granger's co-star.<ref>{{Cite news|title=R.K.O NEAR DEAL ON BRENNAN STORY|author=THOMAS F BRADY|date=Nov 20, 1950|work=New York Times|id={{ProQuest|111714148}}}}</ref> [[Ricardo Montalb\u00e1n]] was signed to play the Marquis de Maynes, the villain.<ref>{{Cite news|title=FILM COUNCIL IRKED BY WARNER LAY-OFF|author=THOMAS F BRADY|date=Dec 5, 1950|work=New York Times|id={{ProQuest|111626328}}}}</ref>\n\n[[Talbot Jennings]] wrote the first script, [[Casey Wilson]] was assigned as producer and [[George Sidney]] as director.<ref>{{Cite news|title=REPUBLIC TO MAKE FILM ABOUT PACIFIC|author=THOMAS F BRADY|date=Jul 21, 1950|work=New York Times|id={{ProQuest|111685441}}}}</ref>\n\nEventually Montalban was dropped and it was announced Granger would play both the hero and the villain.<ref>{{Cite news|title=STUDIOS ACQUIRE 3 MAJOR STORIES|author=THOMAS F BRADY|date=Dec 22, 1950|work=New York Times|id={{ProQuest|111577928}}}}</ref> [[Elizabeth Taylor]] was mentioned as a female lead in addition to Gardner.<ref>{{Cite news|title=ELIZABETH TAYLOR GETS METRO LEAD|author=THOMAS F BRADY|date=Jan 27, 1951|work=New York Times|id={{ProQuest|111848185}}}}</ref>\n\nGranger was then cast in ''Constable Pedley'' (later called ''[[The Wild North]]'') which required location filming in snow.

Everyone disliked this man ... Stewart Granger was a dreadful person, rude ... just awful. Just being in his presence was bad. I thought at one point the crew was going kill him. Jean visited him on the set and would leave his dressing room in tears. He humiliated her. It was terrible.\n\nAll of the dueling scenes in ''Scaramouche'' were wonderful, though. I'll give Granger credit for that. He didn't know how to do any of that, but worked hard and learned. Mel Ferrer, his counterpart in the movie, was extremely adept at the swordplay, but was a gentleman. He could have taken advantage and upstaged Granger, the star, but he never did.<ref name=\"noir\">{{cite web|url=http://alankrode.com/public2/vigorish/Eleanor%20Parker%20Interview.pdf|title=Eleanor Parker: Incognito, but Invincible|website=Noir City Sentinel|date=Summer 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161019011307/http://alankrode.com/public2/vigorish/Eleanor%20Parker%20Interview.pdf|archivedate=2016-10-19}}</ref> </blockquote>\n\nEleanor Parker's perception of the fencing in ''Scaramouche'' appears to be mistaken. According to Mel Ferrer:\n\n<blockquote>I'd been playing a lot of goody-goodys, making pictures for Metro; and they asked me to do this one. They asked me if I fenced, and I told them, \"No.\" They said, \"We thought you were a fencer.\" And I said, \"No, I'm a dancer.\" They said, \"So, what do we do about that?\" I said, \"It's very simple. I'll learn to fence the way a dancer would learn a routine. If I were learning a ballet, I'd learn it by number. One, two, three, four ... four, you're on this spot; five, six, seven, you do ''that''; that's the way you learn choreography.\" And I learned how to fence in six weeks.\n\nWe did seven duels in the picture, and each one was different; we never repeated a sequence. And that's like learning seven ballets; it's very, very difficult ...\n\nJimmy [Stewart Granger] knew how to fence already. He'd been in the theater in England, and that's part of the training for actors on the London stage; they learn to fence. They learn how to ride, most all of them learn how to ride  horseback. They're so much more developed as performers than we are; they get so much better training.<ref>''Scaramouche'' DVD Special Feature, \"A Retrospective with Mel Ferrer.\" MGM Home Video, 2003.</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Reception==\n===Critical===\n[[Bosley Crowther]] wrote in his ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' review, \"A cheekier attitude toward romance and a great deal more play with the swords [than the [[Scaramouche (1923 film)|1923 version]]] are in this latter-day whip-up, and these are the things that make it fun. ...
