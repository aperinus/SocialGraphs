''Ong-Bak'' proved to be Jaa's breakout film, with the actor hailed internationally as the next major martial arts star. Jaa went on to star in ''[[Tom-Yum-Goong]]'' (called ''The Protector'' in the US and ''Warrior King'' in the UK) and directed and starred in two prequels to ''Ong-Bak'': ''[[Ong Bak 2|Ong-Bak 2]]'' and ''[[Ong Bak 3|Ong-Bak 3]]''.\n\n== Plot ==\nIn the village of [[Ban Nong Pradu]] in rural northeastern [[Thailand]] lies an ancient [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] statue named Ong-Bak. The village falls in despair after thieves from [[Bangkok]] decapitate the statue and take the head with them. Ting, a villager extremely skilled in [[Muay Thai]], volunteers to travel to Bangkok to recover the stolen head of Ong-Bak. His only lead is Don, a drug dealer who attempted to buy an amulet in Nong Pradu one day earlier.\n\nUpon arriving in Bangkok with a bagful of money donated by his village, Ting meets up with his cousin Humlae, who has dyed his hair blond and begun calling himself \"George\". Humlae and his friend Muay Lek are street-bike racing hustlers who make a living out of conning [[Yaba (drug)|yaba]] dealers. Reluctant to help Ting, Humlae steals Ting's money and bets all of it in an underground fighting tournament at a bar on [[Khaosan Road]]. Ting tracks down Humlae and gets his money back after stunning the crowd by knocking out the champion in the ring with one kick. His extraordinary skill grabs the attention of Komtuan, a grey-haired crime lord who uses a wheelchair and needs an [[electrolarynx]] to speak. It is discovered that Don had stolen Ong-Bak's head to sell to Komtuan, who sees no value in it and orders him to dispose of it.\n\nThe next day, Humlae and Muay Lek are chased all over town by drug dealer Peng and his gang after a botched [[Baccarat (card game)|baccarat]] game scam at an illegal street gambling booth. Ting fights off most of the thugs and helps Humlae and Muay Lek escape in exchange for helping him find Don. They return to the bar, where Ting wins the respect of the crowd after defeating three opponents consecutively. The trio find Don's hideout, triggering a lengthy [[Auto rickshaw#Thailand|tuk-tuk]] chase. The chase ends at a port in the [[Chao Phraya River]], where Ting discovers Komtuan's cache of stolen Buddha statues submerged underwater.\n\nAfter the statues are recovered by local police, Komtuan sends his thugs to kidnap Muay Lek and tells Humlae to ask Ting to fight his bodyguard Saming near the Thai-[[Myanmar|Burmese]] border in exchange for Muay Lek and the Ong-Bak head. Ting is forced to throw the match against the drug-enhanced Saming, and Humlae throws in the towel. After the fight, Komtuan reneges on his promise to release Muay Lek and return the head, and he orders his henchmen to kill the trio. Ting and Humlae subdue the thugs and head to a mountain cave, where Komtuan's men are decapitating a giant Buddha statue. Ting defeats the remaining thugs and Saming, but is shot by Komtuan. Before the crime lord attempts to destroy the Ong-Bak head with a sledgehammer, Humlae jumps to protect it, taking the brunt of the hammer blows. The giant Buddha statue head suddenly falls, crushing Komtuan to death and critically injuring Humlae. Humlae gives Ting the Ong-Bak head, and with his dying breath, asks him to look after Muay Lek and make sure she graduates from college.\n\nThe head of Ong-Bak is restored in Ban Nong Pradu. Humlae's ashes, carried by an ordained monk, arrives into the village in a procession on an elephant's back while the villagers and Muay Lek celebrate the return of Ong Bak's head.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Tony Jaa]] as Ting from [[Ban Nong Pradu]] Village\n* [[Petchtai Wongkamlao]] as George/Humlae (as Mum Jokemok in ending credits)\n* [[Pumwaree Yodkamol]] as Muay Lek\n* [[Chattapong Pantana-Angkul]] as Saming Sibtid\n* Suchao Pongwilai as Komtuan (as Suchoa Pongvilai in ending credits)\n* Wannakit Sirioput as Don (Komtuan's henchman) (as Wannakit Siriput in ending credits)\n* Chumphorn Thepphithak as Uncle Mao (as Chumporn Teppitak in ending credits)\n* Rungrawee Barijindakul as Ngek (as Rungrawee Borrijindakul in ending credits)\n* Cheathavuth Watcharakhun as Peng (as Chetwut Wacharakun in ending credits)\n* Somjal Jonmoontee as Bodyguard 1 (as Somjai Gunmoontree in ending credits)\n* Somchai Moonma as Bodyguard 2\n* Taworn Tonapan as Bodyguard 3\n* [[Dan Chupong]] as Bodyguard 4 (as Chupong Changprung in ending credits)\n* Chaiporn Gunmoontree as Bodyguard 5\n* Don Ferguson as Bodyguard 6\n* [[Panna Rittikrai]] as Nong Pradu Villager (''uncredited'')\n\nClub fighters:\n* David Ismalone as Mad Dog\n* Hans Eric as Pearl Harbour\n* Paul Gaius as Lee\n* Nick Kara as Big Bear\n* Nudhapol Asavabhakhin as Toshiro\n* Taweesin Visanuyothin as Doctor Sak\n\n==Production==\n''Ong-Bak'' introduced international audiences to a traditional form of [[muay Thai]] (or [[Muay Boran]], an ancient muay Thai style), a [[kickboxing]] style that is known for violent strikes with fists, feet, shins, elbows, and knees. The fights were choreographed by [[Panna Rittikrai]], who was also Tony Jaa's mentor and a veteran director of [[B-movie]] [[action film]]s.\n\nJaa, who was trained in Muay Thai since childhood, wanted to make the film in order to bring Muay Thai to the mainstream. He and Panna struggled to raise money to produce a demo reel to drum up interest for the making of the film. Their first reel was made on expired film stock, so they had to raise more money and start over.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}\n\nDuring the foot chase through the alleys, there is writing on a shop house door that reads \"Hi Speilberg, let do it together\" [sic]. This refers to the director's desire to someday work with [[Steven Spielberg]].<ref>Duong, Sehn. August 16, 2006.

Most of the subplot involving Muay Lek's sister, Ngek, was removed, and the final showdown between Ting and Saming was shortened. EuropaCorp also re-scored the soundtrack with some [[Hip hop music|hip-hop]] sounds, replacing the Thai rock score; this is this version that has been made available in the [[United States]] and most of the Western world.\n\nFor the [[United Kingdom]] release, the soundtrack was scored yet again; this time with an orchestral score, but the film was left uncut with the subplot of Ngek.\n\nThe Hong Kong cut of the film's theatrical release omits a \"bone breaking\" sequence toward the end, where George's arm is snapped and Ting in turn snaps the leg of a bad guy. [[DVD]] releases in Hong Kong have the scene restored.\n\nAn alternative ending offered on the Thai, U.S., Australian, and UK DVD releases has Humlae surviving. He is seen at the end bandaged up, limping, with his arm broken, supported by his parents. Prachya Pinkaew stated in an interview that although there was debate, they ultimately decided it would be appropriate for him to make a meaningful sacrifice for the village.\n\n===Alternate titles===\n* In Thailand, Germany and in France, it was simply called ''Ong-Bak''. This name was also preserved in ''[[Premier Asia|Premier Asia's]]'' UK release.\n* For the release in Singapore, Australia and other territories, as well as film festivals, the movie was released as ''Ong-Bak: Muay Thai Warrior''.\n* In the United States, Canada and other areas, the movie was released as ''Ong-Bak: The Thai Warrior''.\n* The [[Hong Kong]] [[English language|English]] title was ''Thai Fist''.\n* In [[Japan]], the film was released as {{nihongo|''Mahha!!!!!!!!''|\u30de\u30c3\u30cf!!!!!!!!}} (the Japanese word for \"[[Mach number|Mach]]\").\n* In [[Italy]], the title was ''Ong-Bak: Nato per Combattere'', which translates as ''Ong-Bak: Born to Fight''.\n* In [[India]], the title was ''Enter the New Dragon'' in reference to [[Bruce Lee]].\n* In [[Mexico]], the title was ''Ong-Bak: El Nuevo Drag\u00f3n'', which translates as ''Ong-Bak: The New Dragon'', in reference to Bruce Lee.\n* In [[Vietnam]], the title was ''Ong-Bak: The hunt of the statue of Buddha'' (Ong-Bak: Truy t\u00ecm t\u01b0\u1ee3ng Ph\u1eadt).\n* In [[Brazil]], the title was ''Ong-Bak: Sacred Warrior'' (Ong-Bak: Guerreiro Sagrado).\n\n==Home media==\n''Ong-Bak: The Thai Warrior'' was released in the U.S. on [[DVD]] by [[Magnolia Pictures]] on August 30, 2005<ref>{{cite web|url=http://homevideo.about.com/od/worldfilm/p/OngBakMovieDVDa.htm|title=''Ong-Bak: The Thai Warrior'' DVD|publisher=[[About.com]]|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140414070045/http://homevideo.about.com/od/worldfilm/p/OngBakMovieDVDa.htm|archive-date=April 14, 2014|access-date=2013-08-24}}</ref> and on [[Blu-ray Disc]] by [[20th Century Fox]] on February 2, 2010.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.blu-ray.com/news/?id=4068 |title=''Ong-Bak'' Blu-ray Announced |author=Calonge, Juan |publisher=Blu-ray.com |date=2010-01-21 |access-date=2013-08-24}}</ref>\n\n==Box office and reception==\n''Ong-Bak'' premiered as the closing film of the [[2003 Bangkok International Film Festival]], and then opened in a wide release in Thailand cinemas in February 2003.
