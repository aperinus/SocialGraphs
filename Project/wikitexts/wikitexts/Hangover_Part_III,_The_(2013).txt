Pictures]]. It is the third and final installment in [[The Hangover (film series)|''The Hangover'' trilogy]]. The film stars [[Bradley Cooper]], [[Ed Helms]], [[Zach Galifianakis]], [[Ken Jeong]], [[Jeffrey Tambor]], [[Heather Graham]], [[Mike Epps]], [[Melissa McCarthy]], [[Justin Bartha]], and [[John Goodman]] with [[Todd Phillips]] directing a screenplay written by himself and [[Craig Mazin]].\n\nThe film follows the \"Wolfpack\" (Phil, Stu, Doug, and Alan) as they try to get Alan the help he needs after facing a personal crisis, after the bachelor party in Bangkok. However, things go awry when an incident from the original film comes back to haunt them.\n\n''The Hangover Part III'' was announced days before the release of ''[[The Hangover Part II]]'' and Mazin, who co-wrote ''Part II'', was brought on board. In January 2012, the principal actors re-signed to star. In March 2012, Warner Bros. announced a U.S. [[Memorial Day|Memorial Weekend]] release. The supporting roles were cast between June and September 2012. [[Principal photography]] began in September 2012 in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]] before moving to [[Nogales, Arizona]] and [[Las Vegas, Nevada]]. The film has its world premiere on May 13, 2013, in [[Los Angeles, California]], and was released by [[Warner Bros.]] in the United States on May 23, 2013. It received negative reviews from critics and grossed $362 million worldwide.\n\n== Plot ==\n<!-- PER WP:FILMPLOT, PLOT SUMMARIES FOR FEATURE FILMS SHOULD BE BETWEEN 400 AND 700 WORDS. -->\nTwo years after [[The Hangover Part II|the events in Bangkok]], Leslie Chow escapes confinement during a [[prison riot]]. Meanwhile, Alan Garner causes a multi-car freeway pileup after he purchases a [[giraffe]] and accidentally decapitates it on a low overpass. Alan's father Sid, upset about the incident and furious that Alan will not take responsibility for his actions, dies of a [[heart attack]]. At the funeral, Alan's brother-in-law Doug Billings informs Phil Wenneck and Stu Price that Alan has been off his [[Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder|ADHD]] medication and is out of control. The group attends an intervention in which Alan agrees to visit a rehabilitation facility in [[Arizona]] where he can seek treatment as long as the \"Wolfpack\" take him there.\n\nPhil's minivan is rammed off the road by a rental truck and the Wolfpack is taken hostage. They are later confronted by mob boss Marshall, with \"Black Doug\" as his head enforcer. He tells them that a few weeks after [[The Hangover|their shenanigans in Las Vegas]], Chow hijacked half of a $42 million gold heist, and, seeing how Alan has been the only one to communicate with Chow during his imprisonment, deduced that they could locate him and retrieve the gold. Marshall kidnaps Doug and gives the others three days to find Chow, or else Doug will be killed.\n\nAlan sets up a meeting with Chow in [[Tijuana]], where Stu and Phil will hide and attempt to drug him. However, Alan accidentally reveals their location and Chow forces them to confess they are working for Marshall. Chow explains his plan to retrieve the stolen gold from the basement of a Mexican villa he previously owned.\n\nThey break into the house and successfully retrieve the gold, but Chow double-crosses them, locking them in the basement, rearming the security system and escaping in Phil's minivan. They are arrested, but mysteriously released from the police station. They are picked up by a limousine and taken back to the villa, where they find Marshall. They learn that Chow had lied to them: the villa was in fact Marshall's the whole time and the gold they stole was the other half Chow did not get from Marshall. He spares the group for the oversight but kills \"Black Doug\" for his incompetence and reminds them of their now two-day deadline.\n\nThey track Phil's phone, which was left in the minivan, and find it left outside a [[pawn shop]] in [[Las Vegas]]. The owner, Cassie, tells them that Chow traded a gold brick for only $18,000, far less than its actual $400,000 value and gives them a business card for an escort service Chow is using. Using Stu's former lover Jade as their contact, they learn that Chow is barricaded in the penthouse suite of [[Caesars Palace]]. Phil and Alan sneak into his suite from the roof, but Chow escapes, jumping from the balcony and parachuting down to the [[Las Vegas Strip|Strip]]. Stu catches up to Chow and locks him in the trunk of Marshall's limousine. They take the gold and meet with Marshall, who releases Doug when they reveal they cannot secure the original half as Chow lost it all in Bangkok. Although Marshall had promised not to harm Chow, he shoots up the trunk of the car, presumably killing him.\n\nHowever, Alan had given Chow the means to escape from the trunk through a backseat compartment just moments earlier. Chow emerges from the limo and kills Marshall and his bodyguard, but spares Phil and Stu because Alan saved his life. He offers Alan a bar of gold as a gift, but Alan turns him down and ends their friendship because of Chow's unhealthy influence on the group. As Chow sadly watches them leave, they go to retrieve Phil's minivan from the pawnshop and Alan makes a date with Cassie. Six months later, they marry and Alan resigns from the Wolfpack.\n\nIn a mid-credits scene, the Wolfpack plus Cassie appear to have staged another wild party that they can't remember. Stu now has [[breast implants]] and Alan remembers that the wedding cake was a gift from Chow. Chow emerges from the bathroom naked, carrying a [[katana]]. The chain-smoking [[Bangkok]] [[Capuchin monkey|monkey]] drops from the ceiling onto Stu, startling him.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{Div col}}\n<!-- opening title cards -->\n* [[Bradley Cooper]] as Phil Wenneck\n* [[Ed Helms]] as Dr. Stuart \"Stu\" Price\n* [[Zach Galifianakis]] as Alan Garner\n* [[Ken Jeong]] as Leslie Chow\n* [[Jeffrey Tambor]] as Sid Garner\n* [[Heather Graham]] as Jade\n* [[Mike Epps]] as Black Doug\n<!-- with -->\n* [[Justin Bartha]] as Doug Billings\n<!-- and -->\n* [[John Goodman]] as Marshall\n<!-- appears two at a time -->\n* [[Sasha Barrese]] as Tracy Billings\n* [[Jamie Chung]] as Lauren Price\n* [[Sondra Currie]] as Linda Garner \n* [[Gillian Vigman]] as Stephanie Wenneck\n<!-- end opening title cards -->\n{{Div col end}}\n\n[[Melissa McCarthy]] portrays Cassie, a [[pawn shop]] worker.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1707894/hangover-iii-melissa-mccarthy-cameo/|title = 'The Hangover Part III': The Truth Behind the Grossest Scene}}</ref>\n\n== Production ==\nIn May 2011, days before the release of ''[[The Hangover Part II]]'', director [[Todd Phillips]] said that \"there already are plans for a third film but no script or start date\".<ref name=\"LATimes\" /> About the possibility of ''The Hangover Part III'', Phillips stated, \"If we were to do a third one, if the audience, if the desire was there, I think we have a very clear idea where that would head. It's certainly not in the same template that you've seen these movies. The third would be very much a finale and an ending.

As far as where it takes place, I said I'm very open.\"<ref name=\"IndieWire\" /> Also during May, [[Craig Mazin]], who co-wrote ''The Hangover Part II'', entered early talks to write the script for the third installment.<ref name=\"THR\" />\n\nIn December 2011, [[Bradley Cooper]] appeared on ''[[The Graham Norton Show]]'' to promote ''The Hangover Part II'' DVD and Blu-ray release, where he stated he \"hopes\" that ''The Hangover Part III'' will start shooting in September 2012, and also stated that Todd Phillips is working on the script.<ref name=\"THR-2\" /> In January 2012, it was reported that stars [[Bradley Cooper]], [[Zach Galifianakis]], and [[Ed Helms]] were nearing deals to reprise their roles in third installment with each receiving $15 million (against the backend) for their participation.<ref name=\"Cast\" /> In February 2012, [[Mike Tyson]] stated that he would return in the third film,<ref name=\"Tyson\" /> although he later told [[TMZ]] that \"I have no idea what's going on.
