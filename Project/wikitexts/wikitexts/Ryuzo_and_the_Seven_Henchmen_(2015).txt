Still in contact with his former lieutenant, Masa (Masaomi Kond\u014d), Ryuzo maintains his short temper with their regular get-togethers. One day, the old gangster receives a call from an impostor pretending to be his son asking for \u00a55 million. Ry\u016bz\u014d sees through the trick and learns from police detective Murakami (Beat Takeshi) that a member from the Keihin Rengo gang is responsible. Re-uniting his seven former henchmen to strike back, Ry\u016bz\u014d learns that they have all grown weak with their old age. The elderly yakuza members soon learn that they must overcome their weaknesses if they are to prove to be a match against the younger Keihin Rengo.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Tatsuya Fuji]] as Ryuzo\n*[[Masaomi Kond\u014d]] as Masa\n*[[Akira Nakao]] as Mokichi\n*[[T\u014dru Shinagawa]] as Mac\n*[[Ben Hiura]] as Ichiz\u014d\n*[[K\u014djun It\u014d]] as Hide\n*[[Ken Yoshizawa]] as Taka\n*[[Akira Onodera]] as Yasu\n*[[Masanobu Katsumura]] as Ryuhei\n*[[Hisako Manda]] as Hostess\n*[[Takeshi Kitano|Beat Takeshi]] as Murakami\n*[[Ken Yasuda (actor)|Ken Yasuda]] as Nishi\n\n==Reception==\nThe film earned {{JPY|184.66 million}} on its opening weekend in Japan.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.tokyohive.com/article/2015/04/japan-box-office-report-4-254-26|title= Japan Box Office Report \u2013 4/25~4/26|date= April 28, 2015|accessdate= April 28, 2015|work= tokyohive|publisher= 6Theory Media, LLC}}</ref> By May 17, the film had grossed over {{USD|10 million}}.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://variety.com/2015/film/box-office/japan-box-office-cinderella-1201499704/|title= Japan Box Office: 'Cinderella' Wins Fourth Weekend|author= Mark Schilling|date= May 18, 2015|accessdate= May 22, 2015|work= [[variety.com]]}}</ref> In a review for ''[[The Japan Times]]'', [[Mark Schilling]] applauded Tatsuya Fuji for his performance of Ryuzo, stating, \"Though looking every one of his 74 real-life years, Fuji brings a volatile energy to proceedings that would otherwise be merely absurd... when he starts raging against the dying of the light, look out for flying debris \u2014 and prepare to laugh.\"<ref>{{cite web|last1=Schilling|first1=Mark|title=Takeshi Kitano's gang of nursing-home yakuza|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/culture/2015/04/29/films/film-reviews/takeshi-kitanos-gang-nursing-home-yakuza/#.VUUjoPlVikp|website=The Japan Times|date=29 April 2015 |publisher=The Japan Times|accessdate=2 May 2015}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{Official website|http://www.ryuzo7.jp/}} {{in lang|ja}}\n*{{IMDb title|4176776|Ry\u00fbz\u00f4 to 7 nin no kobun tachi}}\n\n{{Takeshi Kitano}}\n\n[[Category:2015 action comedy films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Takeshi Kitano]]\n[[Category:Japanese action comedy films]]\n[[Category:Yakuza films]]\n[[Category:2015 comedy films]]\n[[Category:2010s Japanese films]]\n\n\n{{2010s-comedy-film-stub}}\n{{2010s-Japan-film-stub}}"}]}}}}
