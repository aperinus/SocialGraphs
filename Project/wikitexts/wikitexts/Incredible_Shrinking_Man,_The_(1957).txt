The film stars [[Grant Williams (actor)|Grant Williams]] as Scott and [[Randy Stuart]] as Scott's wife Louise. While relaxing on a boat, Scott is enveloped by a strange fog. Months later, he discovers that he appears to be shrinking. By the time Scott has reached the height of a small boy, his condition becomes known to the public. When he learns there is no cure for his condition, he lashes out at his wife. As Scott shrinks to the point he can fit into a doll house, he has a battle with his family cat, which leaves him lost and alone in his basement, where he is now smaller than the average insect.\n\nThe film's storyline was expanded by Matheson after he had sold the story to [[Universal Pictures|Universal-International Pictures Co., Inc.]] He also completed the novel upon which the film is based while production was under way. Matheson's script was written in flashbacks, and [[Richard Alan Simmons]] rewrote it using a more conventional narrative structure. Director Jack Arnold initially wanted [[Dan O'Herlihy]] to play Scott. O'Herlihy turned down the role, leading Universal to sign Williams to star in the lead. Filming began on May 31, 1956. Scenes involving special effects were shot throughout production, while others used the large sets of Universal's back lot. Production went over budget, and filming had to be extended; certain special effects shots required reshooting. Williams was constantly being injured on set.\n\nBefore the film's release in New York City on February 22, 1957, its ending first went to test audiences who felt the character's fate should be changed. The director's original ending remained in the film. The film grossed $1.43 million in the United States and Canada and was among the highest-grossing science fiction films of the 1950s. A sequel, ''The Fantastic Little Girl'', originally penned by Matheson, never went into production. A remake was developed years later, eventually becoming the comedy ''[[The Incredible Shrinking Woman]]'' (1981). Other remakes were planned in the early 2000s, one of which was to star [[Eddie Murphy]] in a more comedic variation on the film. A new adaptation was announced in 2013, with Matheson writing the screenplay with his son [[Richard Christian Matheson]].  In 2009, the film was selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".\n\n==Plot==\nRobert Scott Carey, known as \"Scott\", is on vacation with his wife, Louise, when a strange mist covers him. Six months later, Scott notices his clothes are too large, suspects he is shrinking and seeks medical advice.  At first dismissive, Scott's doctor confirms his shrinking using X-rays. Scott is referred to a medical research institute, where it is determined Scott's exposure to the mist, combined with his later exposure to a pesticide, rearranged his molecular structure, causing him to shrink. Scott tells Louise in light of his predicament she is free to leave him. Louise promises to stay, as Scott's wedding ring falls off his finger.\n\nScott's condition makes him a national curiosity. Media attention forces Scott into seclusion inside his home. Scott is advised to sell his story and he begins keeping a journal of his experiences. Scott's humiliation causes him to lash out at Louise in frustration. An antidote is discovered arresting Scott's shrinking at three feet in height, but doctors warn him that he will remain that height unless something is found to reverse his condition. Emotionally broken, Scott goes out and meets Clarice, a carnival worker and female [[Dwarfism|dwarf]], who is exactly Scott's height. Clarice encourages Scott and he is inspired to continue his journal. Later, Scott notices he is now shorter than Clarice, and dejectedly runs home.\n\nScott shrinks small enough to live in a dollhouse and becomes more tyrannical. When Louise leaves home on an errand, Scott falls into his basement after Butch, the family cat, attacks him. Louise returns and assumes Butch ate Scott after she finds a bloody scrap of Scott's clothing. Louise prepares to move out, with Scott's brother, Charlie, helping.\n\nScott encounters much hardship navigating his basement. The water heater bursts, but when Charlie and Louise come to investigate, Scott is too small for them to hear his screams for help. Scott next battles a large spider while finding food and shelter for himself. He ultimately kills the spider with a straight pin, and collapses in exhaustion. He awakens small enough to escape the basement through one of the squares of a window screen. Scott accepts his fate of shrinking to sub-atomic size. He is no longer afraid, concluding that no matter how small he becomes, he will still matter in the universe because God will know he exists.\n\n==Cast==\nCast adapted from the [[American Film Institute]].<ref name=\"afi\" />\n{{castlist|\n* [[Grant Williams (actor)|Grant Williams]] as Robert \"Scott\" Carey\n* [[Randy Stuart]] as Louise Carey\n* April Kent as Clarice Bruce\n* [[Paul Langton]] as Charlie Carey\n* [[Raymond Bailey]] as Dr. Silver\n* [[William Schallert]] as Dr. Bramson\n* Diana Darrin as the nurse\n* [[Billy Curtis]] as midget\n* [[Orangey]] as Butch the cat}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development and pre-production===\n[[File:Dan O'Herlihy 1955.JPG|thumbnail|left|alt=A black-and-white head shot of Dan O'Herlihy looking to his left| Producer [[Albert Zugsmith]] initially wanted [[Dan O'Herlihy]] (pictured) to play the role of Scott Carey.]]\n<!-- development of the concept and script, as well as the securing of financing and producers -->\n[[Richard Matheson]]'s idea for the original novel was inspired by a scene in the film ''[[Let's Do It Again (1953 film)|Let's Do It Again]]'', where [[Ray Milland]]'s character leaves an apartment with the wrong hat.

For example, shots with Randy Stuart were taken against a black velvet backdrop and then composited with shots of Williams on an enlarged living room set. Their movements were synchronized using negatives from the first exposed scene in the camera gate, with the opposite done for the other scene.{{sfn|Lucas|2017|loc=00:20:48}} Sound production began on May 31.{{sfn|Lucas|2017|loc=00:05:34}} An oversized dollhouse was built for Williams on Stage 28. It had previously been used for ''[[The Phantom of the Opera (1925 film)|The Phantom of the Opera]]'' and ''[[Dracula (1931 English-language film)|Dracula]]''.{{sfn|Lucas|2017|loc=00:31:03}} Arnold said he filmed scenes with the cat in a normal studio with an animal trainer who had about 40 identical cats.{{sfn|Lucas|2017|loc=00:33:40}} To coax the cat to approach the dollhouse, Arnold hid food in it so the cat would find a way into the house.{{sfn|Lucas|2017|loc=00:34:00}} Later he timed the cat's reactions and directed Williams accordingly to react to the cat.{{sfn|Lucas|2017|loc=00:34:00}} Arnold first attempted to follow the novel and use a black widow spider. After preliminary tests, he found black widows were too small to use properly in the film.{{sfn|Lucas|2017|loc=00:49:20}} In an interview with Tom Weaver, Randy Stuart said the spiders presented problems. The overhead lamps on the set had to be turned up high, leading to the deaths of 24 tarantulas.{{sfn|Warren|2009|p=405}} They were directed with little puffs of air, a technique which had been used previously in Arnold's film ''[[Tarantula (film)|Tarantula]]''.{{sfn|Warren|2009|p=405}} Despite sources suggesting otherwise, the films did not use the same tarantulas.{{sfn|Warren|2009|p=405}}<ref name=\"afi\" />\n\nMany of the basement scenes were shot on Stage 12 of Universal Studios which, according to Tom Weaver, was one of the largest [[sound stage]]s in the world at the time.{{sfn|Lucas|2017|loc=00:38:39}} While trying to find a way to simulate giant drops of water landing, Arnold recalled a time when he was a child and found condoms in his father's drawer. Not knowing what they were, he filled them with water and dropped them.{{sfn|Lucas|2017|loc=00:41:05}} Arnold ordered about 100 condoms and placed them on a treadmill so they would drop in sequence.{{sfn|Lucas|2017|loc=00:41:05}} The flood scene was shot on July 2 and 3.{{sfn|Lucas|2017|loc=01:03:55}} There was a 20-minute delay in filming because of a bad camera cable. There was a further delay from 11:05&nbsp;am to 11:25&nbsp;am to allow water to drain so a crane could be used properly.{{sfn|Lucas|2017|loc=01:04:30}} These scenes involved nine-hour workdays. When the actors were not filming, they were sent to have publicity shots taken.{{sfn|Lucas|2017|loc=01:04:30}}\n\nThe film was originally shot in the standard 4:3 [[Aspect ratio (image)|aspect ratio]], but midway through filming, on June 22, it was decided that the remaining footage would be shot in 1.75:1. The belief was this would give the film a better look, as a shorter frame would allow the production department to scale down the height of certain props for the special effects.{{sfn|Lucas|2017|loc=00:37:32}} During this period, Grant Williams suffered the first of many injuries on set. On June 22, he reported to the studio hospital with a scratched leg; on June 29, he had to leave the set to be treated for an eye condition; and on July 2 he both had to be driven to the hospital for further treatment for his eyes{{sfn|Lucas|2017|loc=00:56:05}} and was sent to the studio hospital with blisters and scratches from climbing sets.{{sfn|Lucas|2017|loc=00:57:15}} Due to Williams' injuries and some special effects shots being too bright, the film was four days behind schedule and $25,000 over budget.{{sfn|Lucas|2017|loc=00:57:15}}\n\n===Post-production===\nSpecial effects shots using black velvet [[trick photography]] took three weeks of post-production and were scheduled after the film completed production on July 13, 1956.{{sfn|Lucas|2017|loc=00:04:18}}  Warren described the special effects as \"hard to assign correctly.\"{{sfn|Warren|2009|p=405}} Clifford Stine, whose field was process work and [[Rear projection effect|rear screen projection]], is credited with \"special photography\".{{sfn|Warren|2009|p=405}} The boat scene at the beginning of the film was shot on Universal's process stage, which allowed for rear screen projection.{{sfn|Lucas|2017|loc=00:03:59}} Shots of Scott in certain scenes, such as his encounter with the mist, were shot with him against a black velvet back drop.{{sfn|Lucas|2017|loc=00:03:59}}\n\nAccording to Randy Stuart, the film's ending had Williams return to his original size, which Matheson felt was the wrong ending for the story.{{sfn|Weaver|2004|p=308}} Arnold argued with Universal over the ending. The studio wanted a happy ending, while he wanted the original ending that had been shot.{{sfn|Lucas|2017|loc=01:10:30}} To decide on which ending to use, a [[test screening]] was held to judge the audience's reaction.{{sfn|Vieira|2003|p=180}}{{sfn|Vieira|2003|p=181}} Lucas said audience review cards from a December 7 preview screening in California included comments reacting to the ending such as: \"Should've had a different ending, should've grown again.\" and \"What happened at the end?\". On the overall quality of the film, comments included, \"Can't you do any better? This is pretty sad.\" \"You scared my son to death.\" and \"This is an insult to the brain power of my two-year old son\".{{sfn|Lucas|2017|loc=01:10:57}} The film was released with Arnold's original ending intact.{{sfn|Vieira|2003|p=180}}{{sfn|Vieira|2003|p=181}} After its release, Mel Danner, manager of the Circle Theater in [[Waynoka, Oklahoma]], noted audiences felt it was a good film, but that Carey should have returned to his original size at the end.{{sfn|Craig|2013|p=107}}\n\n==Release==\n''The Incredible Shrinking Man'' opened in New York on February 22, 1957.<ref name=\"afi\" /> This was followed by a screening in [[Los Angeles]] on March 27, 1957,  and a wider release in April.<ref name=\"afi\" /> Actress Randy Stuart recalled the film was either \"second or third, I think third, after ''[[The Ten Commandments (1956 film)|The Ten Commandments]]''\" in terms of how much money it made against what it cost.{{sfn|Weaver|2004|p=306}} ''Variety'' reported that by the end of the year it had grossed $1.43 million,<ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|title=Top Grosses of 1957|date=January 8, 1958|page=30}}</ref> making it one of the highest grossing science fiction films of the decade (for comparison, ''[[20,000 Leagues Under the Sea (1954 film)|20,000 Leagues Under the Sea]]'' grossed $8 million, ''[[Journey to the Center of the Earth (1959 film)|Journey to the Center of the Earth]]'' grossed $4.8 million, ''[[The Thing (1951 film)|The Thing from Another World]]'' grossed $1.95 million, and ''[[Invasion of the Body Snatchers]]''  grossed $1.2 million).{{sfn|Hardy|1984|p=387}}{{sfn|Hardy|1984|p=388}}\n\nThe film was reissued theatrically in 1964,{{sfn|Warren|2009|p=408}} but otherwise was rarely shown on television and screened only occasionally at [[science fiction convention]]s.{{sfn|Warren|2009|p=401}} It was released on [[laser disc]] in 1978 and 1991, on [[VHS]] in 1992, and on DVD in 2006 (as part of a box set containing a collection of Universal-International's science fiction films).{{sfn|Warren|2009|p=401}} [[Arrow Films|Arrow Video]] released the film on [[Blu-ray]] in 2017.<ref>{{cite web|\nurl=http://www.theartsdesk.com/film/blu-ray-incredible-shrinking-man|website=[[The Arts Desk]]|title=Blu-ray: The Incredible Shrinking Man|access-date=March 20, 2018|last=Rickson|first=Graham|date=November 14, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171114054844/https://www.theartsdesk.com/film/blu-ray-incredible-shrinking-man|archive-date=November 14, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://arrowfilms.com/product-detail/the-incredible-shrinking-man-blu-ray/FCD1628|website=[[Arrow Films]]|title=The Incredible Shrinking Man|access-date=March 20, 2018}}</ref> In July 2021, [[The Criterion Collection]] announced a blu-ray of the film with a new 4K digital restoration; its bonus material includes audio commentary from Tom Weaver and David Schecter.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.criterion.com/films/28988-the-incredible-shrinking-man|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210716034745/https://www.criterion.com/films/28988-the-incredible-shrinking-man|title=The Incredible Shrinking Man|access-date=July 16, 2021|archive-date=July 16, 2021|publisher=[[The Criterion Collection]]}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\nArnold's biographer Dana M.

Actually it had no particular story line, it was very [[Picaresque novel|picaresque]], it just wandered on.\"{{sfn|Warren|2009|p=402}} Matheson re-iterated his enjoyment of the film in ''[[Cinefantastique]]'', finding himself able to appreciate the film with subsequent watches, finding the visuals as \"truly remarkable\" and that Arnold created \"quite a mood in the film.\"{{sfn|Warren|2009|p=402}} The film was selected for preservation in the [[National Film Registry]] in 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/item/prn-09-250/|title=Michael Jackson, the Muppets and Early Cinema Tapped for Preservation in 2009 Library of Congress National Film Registry|date=December 30, 2009|website=Library of Congress|access-date=June 26, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Complete National Film Registry Listing |url=https://www.loc.gov/programs/national-film-preservation-board/film-registry/complete-national-film-registry-listing/|website=Library of Congress|access-date=2020-05-01}}</ref>\n\n===Proposed sequels and remakes===\n[[File:Richard Matheson (crop).jpg|thumb|alt=Photographic head shot of Richard Matheson| [[Richard Matheson]] wrote a follow-up to the film and was developing a new adaption of his book in 2013.]]\nMatheson scripted a sequel to ''The Incredible Shrinking Man'' titled ''The Fantastic Little Girl''.{{sfn|Warren|2009|p=406}} The film has Louise Carey certain that Scott is still alive.
