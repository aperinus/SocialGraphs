The screenplay by [[Jeffrey Caine]] is based on  [[John le Carr\u00e9]]'s 2001 [[The Constant Gardener|novel of the same name]]. The story follows Justin Quayle ([[Ralph Fiennes]]), a British diplomat in Kenya, as he tries to solve the murder of his wife Tessa ([[Rachel Weisz]]), an [[Amnesty International|Amnesty]] activist, alternating with many [[Flashback (narrative)|flashbacks]] telling the story of their love.\n\nThe film was filmed on location in [[Loiyangalani]] and the slums of [[Kibera]], a section of [[Nairobi]], [[Kenya]]. Circumstances in the area affected the cast and crew to the extent that they set up the [[Constant Gardener Trust]] in order to provide basic education for these villages. The plot was vaguely based on a [[Medical experimentation in Africa#Meningitis testing in Nigeria: 1990s|real-life case in Kano, Nigeria]]. The DVD versions were released in the United States on 1 January 2006 and in the [[United Kingdom]] on 13 March 2006. Justin's gentle but diligent attention to his plants is a recurring background theme, from which image the film's title is derived. [[Hubert Kound\u00e9]], [[Danny Huston]], [[Bill Nighy]], [[Pete Postlethwaite]], and [[Donald Sumpter]] co-star. The film was a critical and box office success and earned four [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] nominations, winning [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]] for Rachel Weisz.\n\n==Plot==\nJustin Quayle, a British diplomat and avid horticulturalist, is confronted by [[Amnesty International]] activist Tessa during a lecture in London. They strike up a romance, and marry after she accompanies him to his posting in [[Kenya]], where she befriends Kenyan doctor Arnold Bluhm, leading to rumors of an affair. Tessa has no qualms confronting corruption, to the chagrin of Justin's superiors, and they lose a child late in her pregnancy.\n\nConnecting local deaths to trials of a new drug, Dypraxa, conducted by Kenyan-based company Three Bees, Tessa and Arnold write a damaging report on the drug. She gives it to Justin's colleague Sandy Woodrow, the British [[High Commissioner]], who sends it to Sir Bernard Pellegrin, head of the Africa Desk at the [[Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office|Foreign Office]]. Pellegrin responds with an incriminating letter to Sandy, which Tessa persuades him to show her, and she steals it before departing for [[Lokichogio|Loki]] with Arnold.\n\nSandy informs Justin that a white woman and black driver have been killed near [[Lake Turkana]], and that Tessa and Arnold shared a room at [[Lodwar]] before hiring a car. Justin and Sandy identify Tessa's mutilated body, but Arnold's whereabouts remain unknown. Police confiscate Tessa's computer and files, but Justin finds her keepsake box, containing a letter from Sandy declaring his love for her and asking her to return Pellegrin's letter, and records of Three Bees' tests.\n\nAfter Tessa's burial, Justin learns from his colleague Ghita that Tessa kept Arnold's secret that he was gay, as [[LGBT rights in Kenya|homosexuality is illegal in Kenya]]. Pursuing the truth about his wife's murder, Justin follows the trail of her report. He is briefly detained by police and confronts Three Bees' CEO Kenny Curtis, but receives no answers.\n\nReturning to London, Justin's passport is confiscated. He dines with Pellegrin, who lies that Arnold must have murdered Tessa, and believes that Justin has his incriminating letter. Justin meets with Tessa's cousin and lawyer Ham, and they access her computer files to reveal her investigation into Dypraxa and its manufacturer, pharmaceutical conglomerate KDH, who hired Three Bees to test the drug on unsuspecting Kenyans.\n\nJustin receives a threatening note, and Ham provides him with a fake passport to travel to Germany, where he meets Tessa's contact Birgit, part of a pharmaceutical watchdog group. The group has been targeted and she is reluctant to speak, and Justin is attacked in his hotel room and warned to stop investigating. Arnold's body is found tortured to death, while the announcement of a safe Dypraxa causes KDH's stock price to soar.\n\nReturning to Kenya, Justin confronts Sandy, who admits that Tessa's report was silenced to save KDH from spending millions redeveloping the drug. Justin is approached by Curtis, who has been betrayed by KDH, and brought to a mass grave of Dypraxa test subjects. Curtis points Justin to Dr Lorbeer, Dypraxa's inventor, who has fled to Sudan. Tim Donohue, a friend in British intelligence, confirms that Pellegrin had Tessa and Arnold killed. Unable to convince Justin to return home, he gives him a gun.\n\nJustin travels to confront Lorbeer, who is treating remote villagers to atone for the lives claimed by his drug. The village is attacked by raiders, but Justin and Lorbeer escape in a [[United Nations|U.N.]] aid plane, and Lorbeer reveals that he has Pellegrin's letter; Tessa convinced him to record the truth about Dypraxa, but he changed his mind, informing KDH that Tessa and Arnold were en route to expose the company to the U.N.\n\nJustin convinces the pilot to mail Pellegrin's letter to Ham, and to drop him off at Lake Tarkana. Removing the bullets from his gun, his final thoughts are of Tess before he is killed by KDH's henchmen. In London at Tessa and Justin's memorial service, Pellegrin lies that Justin committed suicide in the same place his wife died. Ham announces the reading of an [[epistle]], but instead reads Pellegrin's letter, exposing the deaths caused by Dypraxa and the subsequent coverup. Pellegrin storms out as Ham implicates the British government, KDH, and public complacency regarding the human cost of medicine they take for granted.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast list|\n* [[Ralph Fiennes]] as Justin Quayle\n* [[Rachel Weisz]] as Tessa Abbott-Quayle \n* [[Danny Huston]] as Sandy Woodrow\n* [[Hubert Kound\u00e9]] as Arnold Bluhm\n* [[Archie Panjabi]] as Ghita Pearson\n* [[Bill Nighy]] as Sir Bernard Pellegrin\n* [[Gerard McSorley]] as Sir Kenneth Curtis\n* [[Pete Postlethwaite]] as Lorbeer\n* [[Donald Sumpter]] as Tim Donohue\n* [[Richard McCabe]] as Arthur Hammond\n* [[Juliet Aubrey]] as Gloria Woodrow\n* [[Nick Reding (actor)|Nick Reding]] as Crick\n* [[Christopher Okinda]] as Doctor\n}}\n\n==Inspiration and themes==\nThe plot of the film is loosely based on a [[Medical experimentation in Africa#Meningitis testing in Kano.2C Nigeria|real-life case in Kano, Nigeria]] involving antibacterial testing by Pfizer on small children.\n\nThe film's title derives from Justin's gentle but diligent attention to his plants, a recurring background theme that informs his patience and persistence.\n\n==Production==\n\nThe film was shot partly in [[16mm]]<ref>{{Cite web |last=Prince |first=Ron |title=Shooting On Film {{!}} The Changing Face Of Cinematography: Special Report |url=https://britishcinematographer.co.uk/shooting-on-film/ |access-date=2022-03-17 |website=British Cinematographer |language=en-GB}}</ref> on location in [[Loiyangalani]] and the slums of [[Kibera]], a section of [[Nairobi]], [[Kenya]].

But I can tell you this. As my journey through the pharmaceutical jungle progressed, I came to realize that, by comparison with the reality, my story was as tame as a holiday postcard.\" The text appears over John le Carr\u00e9's name.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Film}}\n* ''[[Abdullahi v.
