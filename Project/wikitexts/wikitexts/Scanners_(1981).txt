In the film, \"scanners\" are [[psychic]]s with unusual [[telepathy|telepathic]] and [[psychokinesis|telekinetic]] powers. ConSec, a purveyor of weaponry and security systems, searches out scanners to use them for its own purposes. The film's plot concerns the attempt by Darryl Revok (Ironside), a renegade scanner, to wage a war against ConSec. Another scanner, Cameron Vale (Lack), is dispatched by ConSec to stop Revok.\n\n''Scanners'' premiered in January 1981 to lukewarm reviews from critics but became one of the first films produced in [[Canada]] to successfully compete with American films at the international box office.<ref name=\"ebert\" /><ref name=\"canby\" /><ref name=\"boxoffice\" /><ref>{{Cite web|title=Scanners|url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/89175/scanners|access-date=2020-12-28|website=www.tcm.com|language=en}}</ref> It brought Cronenberg and his controversial style of [[body horror]] attention from mainstream film audiences for the first time and has since been reevaluated as a [[Cult film|cult classic]].<ref name=\"denofgeek\">{{Cite web |date=2012-11-23|title=Looking back at David Cronenberg's Scanners |url=https://www.denofgeek.com/movies/looking-back-at-david-cronenbergs-scanners/ |website=Den of Geek |access-date=2020-12-28 }}</ref><ref name=\"avclub\">{{Cite web|title=Exploding head aside, Scanners is one of Cronenberg's most conventional films|url=https://film.avclub.com/exploding-head-aside-scanners-is-one-of-cronenberg-s-m-1798180913 |website=[[The A.V. Club]] |access-date=2020-12-28}}</ref> It is particularly well known for a scene that depicts Revok psychically causing a rival scanner's head to explode.\n\n==Plot==\nCameron Vale is a downtrodden vagrant who suffers from voices manifesting in his head. After involuntarily causing a woman to have a [[seizure]] with his telepathy, Vale is captured by the [[private military company]] ConSec and brought to Dr. Paul Ruth, who explains that Vale is one of 237 super-powered individuals known as \"scanners\" capable of telepathy, empathy, [[wiktionary:biopathy|biopathy]] and psychokinesis. Ruth injects Vale with ephemerol, which restores his sanity by temporarily inhibiting his scanning ability, and teaches him to control his abilities. ConSec is attempting to recruit scanners to stop a malevolent underground ring of scanners led by Darryl Revok, a former mental patient who [[Trepanning|trepanned]] his own skull to cope with the same uncontrollable stream of thoughts. Ruth explains that Revok's uncontrolled powers drove him mad and asks Vale to help infiltrate Revok's group. Revok, who is killing all opposing scanners, infiltrates a ConSec marketing event and psychically explodes the head of a domesticated ConSec scanner. ConSec security head Braedon Keller advocates shutting down ConSec's scanner research program but Ruth, who believes the scanners' abilities are the next stage of human evolution, disagrees and notes that the assassination demonstrates Revok's danger. Ruth brings in Vale and asks him to help infiltrate Revok's group.\n\nUnknown to Ruth, Keller is working for Revok as a mole and informs him of Ruth's infiltration plan. Revok dispatches assassins to follow Vale as he visits an unaffiliated scanner named Benjamin Pierce, a successful yet reclusive sculptor who copes with his abilities through his art. Revok's assassins murder Pierce, but Vale reads Pierce's dying brain and learns of a group of scanners, led by Kim Obrist, who oppose Revok's group. Vale tracks down Obrist and attends a meeting, but Revok's assassins strike again; only Vale and Obrist survive. Vale learns of a pharmaceutical company Biocarbon Amalgamate, which he soon discovers Revok is using to distribute large quantities of ephemerol under a ConSec computer program called \"Ripe.\" Vale and Obrist return to ConSec to investigate, and Ruth admits that he founded Biocarbon Amalgamate and suggests Vale cyberpathically scan the computer system to learn more. Keller attacks Obrist and kills Ruth while Vale and Obrist flee the ConSec building. Vale cyberpathically hacks into the computer network through a [[telephone booth]] and downloads ephemerol shipment information directly into his mind. Keller is killed when the computer explodes during his attempt to intercept Vale.\n\nVale and Obrist visit a doctor on the list of ephemerol recipients, where they discover that it is being prescribed to pregnant women, causing their children to become scanners. Revok and his men ambush and abduct Vale and Obrist, taking them to the Biocarbon Amalgamate plant. Revok reveals to Vale that they are both Ruth's children, and their father developed ephemerol as a sedative for pregnant women; Ruth learned about the drug's side-effect during his wife's pregnancies, and he made them the most powerful scanners in the world by administering a prototype dosage prior to abandoning them. Revok plans to create and lead a new generation of scanners to take over the world by mass-distributing ephemerol, but Vale refuses to join the plot accusing Revok of acting like his father, causing him to become enraged. A telepathic duel ensues between the brothers, during the course of which Vale's body is destroyed and burned. However, when Obrist encounters Revok, his head scar has vanished, his eyes are now blue, and he speaks in Vale's voice; Vale had somehow managed to switch his consciousness with Revok's at the last minute.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Jennifer O'Neill]] as Kim Obrist\n* [[Stephen Lack]] as Cameron Vale\n* [[Patrick McGoohan]] as Dr. Paul Ruth\n* [[Lawrence Dane]] as Braedon Keller\n* [[Michael Ironside]] as Darryl Revok\n* [[Robert A.
