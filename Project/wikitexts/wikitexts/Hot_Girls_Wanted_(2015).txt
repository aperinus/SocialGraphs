The filmmakers abandoned this idea when they discovered that the men were mostly watching pornographic videos starring young women. Curious about why such a large number of young women were entering the industry, the film was reoriented to tell their story.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/film-news/11371385/Grim-world-of-teen-porn-exposed-in-Sundance-documentary.html|title=Grim world of teen porn exposed in Sundance documentary|last=Thurston|first=Michael|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|agency=[[Agence France-Presse]]|date=2015-01-27|accessdate=2015-01-29}}</ref>  Further edits took place after the Sundance premiere to address issues the filmmakers identified during screenings.
