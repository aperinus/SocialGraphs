It is the second installment in the [[Superman in film#Salkind film series (1978\u20131987)|''Superman'' film series]] and a sequel to ''[[Superman (1978 film)|Superman]]'' (1978). It stars [[Gene Hackman]], [[Christopher Reeve]], [[Terence Stamp]], [[Ned Beatty]], [[Sarah Douglas (actress)|Sarah Douglas]], [[Margot Kidder]], and [[Jack O'Halloran]]. The film was released in Australia and mainland Europe on December 4, 1980,<ref name=\"Australia release\">{{Cite book |last=Langford |first=David |title=The Sex Column and Other Misprints |year=2005 |publisher=[[Wildside Press]] |isbn=978-1-930997-78-3 |page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=n78kYbvUd_8C&pg=PA42 42]}}</ref> and in other countries throughout 1981. Selected premiere engagements of ''Superman II'' were presented in [[Megasound]], a high-impact surround sound system similar to [[Sensurround]].\n\nIn 1977, it was decided by producers [[Alexander Salkind|Alexander]] and [[Ilya Salkind]] that they would film both ''Superman'' and its sequel simultaneously, with [[principal photography]] beginning in March 1977 and ending in October 1978. Tensions rose between original director [[Richard Donner]] and the producers in which a decision was made to stop filming the sequel, of which 75 percent had already been completed, and finish the first film. Following the release of ''Superman'' in December 1978, Donner was controversially fired as director, and was replaced by Lester. Several members of the cast and crew declined to return in the wake of Donner's firing. To be officially credited as the director, Lester re-shot most of the film in which principal photography resumed in September 1979 and ended in March 1980.\n\nThe film received positive reviews from film critics who praised the performances from Reeve, Stamp and Hackman, the visual effects, and humor. It grossed $190 million against a production budget of $54 million, a box office success but less than its predecessor. A sequel, ''[[Superman III]]'', was released in June 1983, for which Lester returned as director.\n\nA [[director's cut]] of the film, restoring the original vision for the film under Donner's supervision, titled ''[[Superman II: The Richard Donner Cut]]'', was released on November 28, 2006 in various home media formats.\n\n== Plot ==\n<!--If appropriate, please copy any changes made here into [[Superman II: The Richard Donner Cut#Plot]]--><!--Per [[WP:FILMPLOT]], plots are 400\u2013700 words ONLY-->\nBefore the destruction of [[Krypton (comics)|Krypton]],{{efn|As depicted in the 1978 film ''[[Superman (1978 film)|Superman]]''.}} the criminals [[General Zod]], [[Ursa (comics)|Ursa]] and [[Non (comics)|Non]] are sentenced to banishment into the [[Phantom Zone]]. Years later, the Phantom Zone is shattered near Earth by the shockwave of a [[hydrogen bomb]], thrown from Earth by [[Superman]]. The three criminals are freed and find themselves with superpowers granted by the yellow light of the Sun. After landing on the moon and effortlessly killing a team of astronauts exploring there, they continue toward Earth with plans to conquer the planet.\n\nThe ''[[Daily Planet]]'' sends journalist Clark Kent\u2014whose [[secret identity]] is Superman\u2014and his colleague [[Lois Lane]] to [[Niagara Falls]]. Lois suspects Clark and Superman are the same person after Clark is absent when Superman appears and saves a child who falls. Lois intentionally places herself in the falls, but Clark saves her without exposing himself. That night, Clark trips and his arm lands in a lit fireplace. When his hand is unscathed, Clark reveals he is indeed Superman. He takes her to his [[Fortress of Solitude]] in the [[Arctic]], showing her the traces of his past stored within energy crystals. Superman declares his love for Lois and his wish to spend his life with her. After conferring with the artificial intelligence of his mother Lara, Superman removes his superpowers by exposing himself to red Kryptonian sunlight in a crystal chamber, becoming a mortal. Clark and Lois spend the night together, then leave the Fortress and return from the Arctic by automobile.\n\nMeanwhile, after becoming accustomed to Earth, Zod and his cohorts travel to the [[White House]] and force the [[President of the United States]] to surrender. Clark and Lois arrive at a diner, where a thug named Rocky sexually harasses Lois and beats up Clark. The fight is interrupted by an urgent news report where the President resigns his office to Zod. When the President pleads for Superman to save the Earth, General Zod demands that Superman come and \"kneel before Zod!\" Realizing he has made a horrible mistake, Clark returns to the Fortress to see if he can regain his powers.\n\n[[Lex Luthor]] escapes from prison with Eve Teschmacher's help, leaving his accomplice Otis behind. Luthor and Teschmacher infiltrate the Fortress of Solitude before Superman and Lois arrive, and Luthor learns of Superman's connection to Jor-El and General Zod. He finds Zod at the White House and tells him Superman is the son of Jor-El, their jailer, and offers to lead him to Superman in exchange for control of [[Australia]]. The three Kryptonians ally with Luthor and go to the offices of the ''Daily Planet''. Superman arrives, after having found the green crystal that restores his powers, and battles the three. Zod realizes Superman cares for the humans and takes advantage of this by threatening bystanders. Superman realizes the only way to stop Zod and the others is to lure them to the Fortress. Superman flies off, with Zod, Ursa, and Non in pursuit, kidnapping Lois and taking along Luthor. Upon arrival, Zod declares Luthor has outlived his usefulness and plans to kill both him and Superman. Superman tries to get Luthor to lure the three into the crystal chamber to depower them. However, Luthor, eager to get back in Zod's favor, reveals the chamber's secret to the villains. Zod forces Superman into the chamber and activates it. Afterwards, assuming him deprived of his powers, Zod tells Superman to kneel and kiss his hand; instead, Superman crushes Zod's hand and tosses him into a crevice. Luthor deduces that Superman reconfigured the chamber to expose the trio to red sunlight while Superman was protected from it. Non falls into another crevice when trying to fly over it, and Lois knocks Ursa into a third. Superman flies back to civilization, leaving Luthor behind and returning Lois home.\n\nAt the ''Daily Planet'' the following day, Clark finds Lois upset about knowing his secret but not being able to be open about her true feelings. He kisses her, using his abilities to wipe her mind of the knowledge of her past few days. Later, Clark returns to the diner and gets revenge on Rocky. Superman restores the damage done by Zod, replacing the [[American flag]] atop the White House, and tells the President he will not abandon his duty again.<!--If appropriate, please consider copying any changes made here into [[Superman II: The Richard Donner Cut#Plot]]-->\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Gene Hackman]] as [[Lex Luthor (1978 film series character)|Lex Luthor]]: Criminal genius and Superman's archnemesis.

Ursa's evil will and power-lust are equal to and sometimes surpass those of General Zod's.

Zod, upon landing on Earth and gaining the same superpowers as Superman, immediately views humans as a weak and insignificant sub-species and imposes his evil will for world dominance. However, his arrogance causes him to quickly become bored with his powers and he is almost disappointed at how little of a challenge humans are. His insatiable lust for power is replaced however by revenge when he learns that the son of Jor-El stands in the way of his absolute rule of the planet.\n\nAccording to the 2006 documentary ''You Will Believe: The Cinematic Saga of Superman'', Sarah Douglas was the only cast member to do extensive around-the-world press tours in support of the film and was one of the few actors who held a neutral point of view in the Donner-Lester controversy.\n\nRichard Donner briefly appears in a \"walking cameo\" in the film. In the sequence where the de-powered Clark and Lois are seen approaching the truck-stop diner by car, Donner appears walking \"camera left\" past the driver's side. He is wearing a light tan jacket and appears to be smoking a pipe. In his commentary for ''Superman II'', [[Ilya Salkind]] states that the inclusion of his cameo in that scene is proof that the Salkinds held no animosity towards Donner, because if there were, then surely they would have cut it out. Conversely, Donner has used his inclusion in the scene to debunk praise heaped on Lester around the release of the film where Lester took credit for the intense nature of the \"bully\" scene in the diner, pointing out that he (Donner) filmed the scene and not Lester.\n\n== Production history ==\n{{See also|Superman (1978 film)#Production}}\n{{Multiple image\n| perrow            = 2\n| total_width       = 300\n| image1            = Richard Donner (4505771045) (cropped).jpg\n| alt1              = Donner in 1979.\n| image2            = Richard Lester.jpg\n| alt2              = Lester in 1967.\n| footer            = Original director, Richard Donner (pictured in 1979) was fired during production in 1979 and was replaced by Richard Lester (pictured in 1967).\n}}\n\n=== Original production ===\n[[Principal photography]] for both ''Superman'' films began on March 28, 1977 at [[Pinewood Studios]] for the Krypton scenes, but by May 1977, production had run two weeks behind schedule.{{sfn|Scivally|2008|p=83}} It was reported that Donner had developed tensions with [[Alexander Salkind|Alexander]] and [[Ilya Salkind]] and [[Pierre Spengler]] concerning the escalating production budget and production schedule.

I mean control.\"{{sfn|Scivally|2008|p=91}}\n\nAs Donner had become unavailable because he was promoting ''Superman'' in Europe, the Salkinds approached [[Guy Hamilton]] to take over directional reins for ''Superman II'' since Lester was filming ''[[Cuba (film)|Cuba]]'' (1979) at the time. However, Hamilton was unavailable, but by the time ''Superman II'' was ready to begin filming, Lester had completed ''Cuba'' and was available to direct.{{sfn|Scivally|2008|pp=91\u201392}} Eventually, on March 15, 1979, the Salkinds decided to replace Donner with Richard Lester. Donner recalled, \"One day, I got a telegram from them saying my services are no longer needed and that my dear friend Richard Lester would take over. To this day, I have not heard from them.\" Ilya Salkind countered, \"Dick Donner said, 'I will do the second movie on my terms and without [Pierre] Spengler' ... Spengler was my friend since childhood and my father and I were very loyal guys.

The new script featured newly conceived scenes such as a new opening involving Superman thwarting the nuclear terrorists at the [[Eiffel Tower]], Clark rescuing Lois at Niagara Falls, and a new ending in which Clark causes Lois to forget his secret identity through a hypnotic kiss.{{sfn|Weldon|2013|p=200}} Furthermore, cinematographer [[Geoffrey Unsworth]] had died before the release of ''Superman''. With Lester as director, he was not sympathetic to Donner's filmmaking style: \"Donner was emphasizing a kind of grandiose myth. There was a kind of [[David Lean]]-ish attempt in several sequences, and enormous scale. There was a type of epic quality which isn't in my nature, so my work really didn't embrace that...That's not me. That's his vision of it.

The remaining sequences left to be shot included the scenes of the super-villains in [[Midwestern United States|Midwest America]] and the battle in [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]]. With Brando cut from the film, the decision was made to re-shoot the scene in which Clark confesses his love for Lois and surrender his powers. Another scene, as written in the film's original shooting script and shot, was to have Jor-El restore his superpowers by reaching out to him in a tableau reminiscent of the painting ''[[The Creation of Adam]]'', but the younger Salkind felt it was over the top.<ref name=\"Salkind-interview\" /> The first scene was re-shot with actress [[Susannah York]] taking Brando's place while the restoration of Superman's powers would take place off-screen.{{sfn|Weldon|2013|p=200}} Location shooting took place in Canada, Paris, Norway and [[Saint Lucia]]. The Metropolis scenes\u2014in contrast to the first film where they were filmed on location in New York\u2014were filmed entirely on the back lot at Pinewood. The East Houston, Idaho scenes were shot on [[Chobham Common]] in [[Surrey]], 30 miles from London. Throughout filming, Lester opted to retain his directorial technique for the [[Multi-camera setup|three-camera setup]] while shooting scenes, which frustrated the actors as they did not know from where they were being filmed for their close-ups.{{sfn|Rossen|2008|p=119}} However, Reeve noted that it made the production move at a faster pace.<ref>{{cite book|last=Reeve|first=Christopher|title=Still Me|url=https://archive.org/details/stillmereev00reev|year=1998|location=New York|publisher=[[Random House]]|page=[https://archive.org/details/stillmereev00reev/page/206/mode/2up 207]|isbn=978-0-679-45235-5|url-access=registration}}</ref> Filming was completed on March 10, 1980.{{sfn|Scivally|2008|p=94}}\n\nDue to budgetary reasons and actors being unavailable, key scenes filmed by Donner were added to the final film. Since the Lester footage was shot two years later, continuity errors are present in the physique and styling of stars Margot Kidder and Christopher Reeve. In Donner's footage, Reeve appears less bulked as he was still gaining muscle for the part. Kidder also has dramatic changes throughout; in the montage of Lester\u2013Donner material, shot inside the ''Daily Planet'' and the [[Fortress of Solitude]] near the movie's conclusion, her hairstyle, hair color, and even make-up are all inconsistent. Kidder's physical appearance in the Lester footage is noticeably different; during the scenes shot for Donner she appears slender, whereas in the Lester footage she looks thinner.\n\nBefore the film's release, Warner Bros. had appealed to the [[Directors Guild of America]] to arbitrate the appropriate co-director credit, in which they argued Lester could not be credited unless he shot 40 percent of the film. Although Lester had earlier thought he would not be credited, he approached Donner to see if he wished to be credited as co-director. Donner replied, \"I don't share credit\".{{sfn|Mankiewicz|Crane|2012|pp=212\u2013213}}{{sfn|Rossen|2008|p=126}}\n\n== Music ==\n{{Main|Superman music}}\nComposer [[John Williams]] was originally slated to score ''Superman II'' in which he was given a screening with Ilya Salkind and Richard Lester.

It was through this extended version that viewers first caught a glimpse into the ''Superman II'' that might have happened had Richard Donner remained as director. In fact, a majority of the added footage was shot by Donner before Richard Lester became director.\n\n17 of the 24 added minutes were utilized by [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] for its 1984 network premiere. Subsequent ABC airings of the longer version would be cut further for more advertising time. The full 146-minute extended cut was shown internationally, including parts of Canada.\n\n=== Additional footage ===\nThe added footage offers an alternative ending to the film. In the theatrical cut, it is implied that Superman has killed the three Kryptonian villains (going against the strict code that Superman does not kill). In the extended ending, a U.S. \"polar patrol\" is shown picking up the three Kryptonians and Lex Luthor, after which Superman, with Lois standing beside him, destroys the Fortress of Solitude.\n\nAmong the other \"lost\" scenes:\n* Superman passes a [[Concorde]] jet on his way to Paris. This is not in the video release and was actually an outtake from ''[[Superman (1978 film)|Superman: The Movie]]'' as a bridge between Superman saving [[Air Force One]] and his conversation with [[Jor-El]] after his first night.\n* At the end of the film, [[Clark Kent]] bumps into a large bald man, which reminds him to go to the diner to face the obnoxious trucker who beat him up earlier.\n* The [[Phantom Zone]] villains land outside the Fortress of Solitude with [[Lex Luthor]] and [[Lois Lane]], trying to figure out how to get in.\n* Extended scenes of the three [[Kryptonian|Kryptonians']] invasion of the [[White House]], with [[General Zod|Zod]] using a gun and [[Non (comics)|Non]] frightening a dog.\n* Superman cooks a [[souffl\u00e9]] using his heat vision, during dinner with Lois at the Fortress of Solitude.\n* Extended discussion between Zod and [[Ursa (comics)|Ursa]] on the Moon.\n* In East Houston, a boy tries to escape on horseback, only to be killed by Non, who throws a police siren at him.\n\nSome telecast versions remove the following for content:\n* Much violence in the opening White House scene was left out, including Zod murdering several [[United States Secret Service|Secret Service]] agents and [[United States Capitol Police|Capitol Police]] officers with an [[AR-10]] assault rifle.\n* Much of the bully's lines in the bar (\"I don't like your meat anyway!\") was re-edited to (\"I don't like you anyway\").\n* About 35 seconds of the \"Battle of Metropolis\" (Superman flying over Metropolis River) was deleted.\n* Some language and profanity were re-dubbed.\n\nAmong the footage seen in the international/Canadian telecasts:\n* A girl in [[Japan]] watching the destruction of East Houston on TV to the disapproval of her mother, who believes it's a violent TV show.\n* Longer conversation between Lois and Superman after he destroys the Fortress of Solitude.\n* Lex Luthor taking [[Perry White]]'s coffee during the Times Square battle.\n* Lex and Miss Teschmacher admiring the Fortress of Solitude.\n* Lex's negotiating with Superman after they leave the fortress is longer.\n* Zod and his cronies being arrested by Arctic Patrol officers.\n\nIn 2004, the fan-restored [[DVD]] known as ''Superman II: Restored International Cut'' was released through many Superman fan sites.<ref>{{cite web|last=Bridges|first=Jeffrey|url=https://www.supermanhomepage.com/movies/movies.php?topic=sup2-RIC-review|title=Superman II \u2013 Restored International Cut Reviewed |publisher=Superman Homepage |access-date=October 8, 2018}}</ref> It featured extended scenes pulled from international television broadcasts over the years.

In order to make Donner's vision of ''Superman II'' feel less incomplete, finished scenes by Lester that Donner was unable to shoot were incorporated into the film as well as the [[screen test]]s by Reeve and Kidder for one pivotal scene. The film also restores several cut scenes including Marlon Brando as Jor-El, an alternate prologue and opening sequence at the ''Daily Planet'' that omits the Eiffel Tower opening from the original, as well as the original scripted and filmed ending for ''Superman II'' featuring Superman reversing time before it was cut and placed at the end of the first film.\n\n== In other media ==\n=== Comics ===\n* Superman's publisher [[DC Comics]] published a commemorative magazine of ''Superman II'' in 1981. Published as ''[[DC Special Series]]'' #25, it was produced in \"Treasury format\" and included photos and background photos, actor profiles, panel-to-scene comparisons, and pin-ups.<ref name=\"Eury\">{{cite journal|last = Eury|first = Michael|author-link = Michael Eury|title = The Amazing World of Superman Tabloids|journal= [[Back Issue!]]|issue = 61|pages = 11\u201316|publisher = [[TwoMorrows Publishing]]|date = December 2012}}</ref><ref>[http://www.comics.org/issue/35454/?style=default ''DC Special Series'' #25] at the Grand Comics Database</ref>\n* In 2006, the Superman comics themselves adapted elements from the Superman movies, specifically the ice-like look of [[Krypton (comics)|Krypton]], and [[Jor-El]] banishing the criminals to the [[Phantom Zone]].

Written by Robert Venditti and illustrated by Wilfredo Torres, the comic is set in Donnerverse continuity, acting as an alternative continuation of the first two films, while ignoring other Superman films.{{citation needed|date=June 2022}}\n\n=== Television ===\n* In the television series ''[[Smallville]]'', much of the imagery and concepts of the first two Salkind/Donner ''Superman'' films, has been revived as a conscious homage to the film series by the show's creators. These include the ice-crystal [[Fortress of Solitude]], the spinning square in space to represent the [[Phantom Zone]], and the continued presence of the deceased [[Jor-El]] as a disembodied counselor and teacher to young Clark/Kal-El. [[Terence Stamp]], who played [[General Zod]] in the first two films, provided the voice of Jor-El for the series. [[Christopher Reeve]] made two appearances on the show as Dr. [[Virgil Swann]], a disabled scientist who had acquired knowledge of Krypton to pass on to Clark, before Reeve's death in 2004.<ref>{{cite episode|title=Rosetta|series=Smallville|credits=Miles Millar, Alfred Gough (writers), James Marshall (director).|network=[[The WB Television Network|The WB]]|airdate=Feb 25, 2003|season=2|number=17}}</ref><ref>{{cite episode|title=Legacy|series=Smallville|credits=Jeph Loeb(writers), Greg Beeman (director).|network= CW|airdate=April 14, 2004|season=3|number=17}}</ref> A section of [[John Williams]]' [[Superman music|Superman]] theme was included when Reeve made his first appearance, and was later used in the series finale.<ref>{{cite episode|title=Finale|series=Smallville|credits=Turi Meyer, Al Septien (writers) part 1.
