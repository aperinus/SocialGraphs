The screenplay by [[John Farris]] was based on his 1976 [[The Fury (Farris novel)|novel of the same name]].\n\nProduced by [[Frank Yablans]] and released by [[20th Century Fox]] on March 10, 1978, the film was both critically and commercially successful, grossing $24 million from a $7.5 million budget. [[film criticism|Film critic]] [[Pauline Kael]] highly lauded the music, composed and conducted by [[John Williams]], calling it \"as apt and delicately varied a score as any horror movie has ever had\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.popoptiq.com/depalmas-the-fury-dominated-by-one-incredible-set-piece-after-another/|title=De Palma's 'The Fury' is dominated by one incredible set-piece after another|date=2014-05-04|website=PopOptiq|language=en-US|access-date=2019-03-13}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Kael|first=Pauline |title=When the Lights Go Down |year=1980 |publisher=Henry Holt & Co.|isbn=0-0304-251-15}}</ref>\n\n== Plot ==\nIn [[Israel]], ex-[[CIA]] agent Peter Sandza and his [[psychic]] son Robin meet Ben Childress, Peter's old agency colleague. Sandza plans to leave his old life and return to the [[United States]] with his son, but Childress objects and subsequently stages a terrorist attack to cover up kidnapping Robin for his \u201cprotection\u201d. Peter narrowly survives, maiming Childress in the attempt and escaping while heavily injured, but is unable to protect Robin.\n\nMonths later in [[Chicago]], high-school student Gillian Bellaver discovers her psychic powers, including [[Psychokinesis|telekinesis]] and [[extra-sensory perception]], during an in-class demonstration. The uncontrolled manifestations of these powers harm people who physically touch or provoke her. She volunteers to attend the Paragon Institute, a live-in research facility studying psychic powers in adolescents.\n\nMeanwhile, Peter has tracked his son to Chicago. After evading Childress's agents, Peter meets with his girlfriend Hester, a Paragon nurse, who tells him about Gillian. Peter tells Gillian that Paragon's director is cooperating with PSI, a covert agency led by Childress that kidnaps psychic children to weaponize their powers for the American government, managing and controlling the psychics by brainwashing them and eliminating their families.\n\nAs Gillian's psychic prowess grows, she begins experiencing visions of the Institute abusing Robin, who has unsuccessfully attempted escape, and eventually connects to him telepathically. Knowing that she knows too much and that her powers are growing, Childress orders that Gillian be transported to PSI headquarters where Robin is being kept. Hester overhears Childress's conversation and informs Peter, who plans a rescue, hoping she can lead him to Robin.\n\nThe rescue is successful, but Hester is killed in the process. Gillian uses her powers to assist Peter in tracking Robin down to a remote mansion in the countryside, where Childress and his handler Susan have spent the last several months grooming and experimenting on him. Though Robin's abilities have grown to unprecedented levels, he gradually becomes increasingly unstable from the psychological strain of his superiors' machinations, culminating in a mass murder inside [[Old Chicago]], an [[indoor amusement park]].\n\nAs Peter and Gillian infiltrate the mansion, Robin senses her presence. Believing that PSI intends to kill him and replace him with another psychic, he finally snaps, telekinetically torturing and killing Susan. Peter confronts his son, but Robin, a now-schizoid, furiously attacks him. Robin is thrown out of the window and scratches Peter when he tries to save him from falling. When Robin plunges to the ground, a distraught Peter flings himself after his son, thus killing himself.\n\nRobin lingers a bit before finally dying, and seems to make some form of psychic contact with Gillian; he transfers his refined powers to her, implying that she will save herself from Childress and avenge his death. The next morning, Childress approaches Gillian and starts manipulating her to get her to connect with him. Understanding his long-term intentions, she embraces her psychic abilities and avenges the deaths of Robin and Peter by causing Childress's body to explode.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Kirk Douglas]] as Peter Sandza\n* [[John Cassavetes]] as Ben Childress\n* [[Amy Irving]] as Gillian Bellaver\n* [[Carrie Snodgress]] as Hester\n* [[Charles Durning]] as Dr. Jim McKeever\n* [[Andrew Stevens]] as Robin Sandza\n* [[Fiona Lewis]] as Dr. Susan Charles\n* Carol Rossen as Dr. Ellen Lindstrom\n* [[Rutanya Alda]] as Kristen\n* Joyce Easton as Katharine Bellaver\n* [[William Finley (actor)|William Finley]] as Raymond Dunwoodie\n* [[Dennis Franz]] as Bob Eggleston\n* Jane Lambert as Vivian Nuckells\n* Sam Laws as Blackfish\n* J.

The scene at the hotel when [[Kirk Douglas]] escapes the agents took place in a room at the now-defunct Plymouth Hotel, the same room and hotel used in the 1980 film ''[[The Blues Brothers (film)|The Blues Brothers]]''. Other filming locations included the [[Water Tower Place]], [[Lincoln Park, Chicago|Lincoln Park]], and [[Navy Pier]]. The PSI headquarters was a Georgian-style mansion in [[Lake Forest, Illinois|Lake Forest]]. The opening sequence was shot in [[Caesarea]], [[Israel]]. The interiors were filmed at Stage 5 of [[20th Century Fox]] studios in [[Century City]].\n\nIn an interview with The Talks, De Palma said that he had 8 or 9 high-speed cameras to film Cassavetes exploding in the film's conclusion: \"The first time we did it, it didn't work. The body parts didn't go towards the right cameras and this whole set was covered with blood. And it took us almost a week to get back to do take two\".<ref>{{cite web|title=Interview with Brian De Palma|url=http://the-talks.com/interviews/brian-de-palma/|publisher=The Talks}}</ref>\n\nOriginally, the \"psychic powers\" effect was depicted through golden-yellow \"glowing eye\" effect. During post-production, the effect's color was changed from yellow to blue. The original effect can still be seen in some trailers and promotional material. The \"throbbing vein\" effect on the actors forehead was originally in the shooting script for ''[[Carrie (1976 film)|Carrie]]'', but was cut due to time and budgetary constraints.\n\n[[Dennis Franz]] makes his film debut as Bob Eggleston, a cop driving a car that Peter hijacks, while [[Daryl Hannah]] and [[Laura Innes]] make their film debuts as Pam and Jody, students at the school that Gillian attends. [[Jim Belushi]] appears as an uncredited background extra. Film director [[Mark Romanek]] worked on the film as a production assistant, which was his first job in the film industry.\n\n==Reception==\n[[Roger Ebert]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' gave the film three stars out of four and called it \"a stylish entertainment, fast-paced, and acted with great energy. I'm not quite sure it makes a lot of sense, but that's the sort of criticism you only make after it's over.

Murphy of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' stated that \"the film plays very well to an undemanding escapist audience\", but \"those who have to write about the film are confronted with a gaping hole in the script: Apart from a few throwaway references to government agencies and psychic phenomena, there is never, anywhere, a coherent exposition of what all the running and jumping is about. The more one analyzes the picture, the less substantive its story becomes. Better not to think too much about this one\".<ref>Murphy, Arthur D. (March 15, 1978). \"Film Reviews: The Fury\".

It's also, in fits and starts, the kind of mindless fun that only a horror movie that so seriously pretends to be about the mind can be. Mr. De Palma seems to have been less interested in the overall movie than in pulling off a couple of spectacular set-pieces, which he does\".<ref>Canby, Vincent (March 15, 1978).

C19.</ref> [[Gene Siskel]] of the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' gave the film one-and-a-half stars out of four and described it as \"one of those thrillers where you sit around and wait for the big scenes. And the key word in that sentence is 'wait' because there is little in ''The Fury'' to hold your attention in between its three big scenes of extreme violence. That's because the film develops only one character.

The music, composed and conducted by [[John Williams]] and performed by the [[London Symphony Orchestra]] for the LP re-recording, was also highly praised by Kael, who wrote that it \"may be as apt and delicately varied a score as any horror movie has ever had\".<ref>Kael, Pauline (March 20, 1978). \"The Current Cinema\".
