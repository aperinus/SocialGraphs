The two friends struggle to preserve their friendship despite their emerging instincts and the surrounding social pressures demanding them to be adversaries, as they are [[law of the jungle|enemies by nature]].\n\nThe film was directed by [[Ted Berman]], [[Richard Rich (filmmaker)|Richard Rich]], and [[Art Stevens]], marking the [[list of directorial debuts|directorial debuts]] of Berman and Rich. It was produced by [[Ron W. Miller|Ron Miller]], [[Wolfgang Reitherman]], and Art Stevens. The [[ensemble cast|ensemble]] voice cast consists of [[Mickey Rooney]] and [[Kurt Russell]] as Tod and Copper, respectively, with [[Pearl Bailey]], [[Jack Albertson]], [[Sandy Duncan]], [[Jeanette Nolan]], [[Pat Buttram]], [[John Fiedler]], [[John McIntire]], [[Richard Bakalyan|Dick Bakalyan]], [[Paul Winchell]], [[Keith Coogan|Keith Mitchell]], and [[Corey Feldman]] providing the voices of the other characters of the film. Mitchell and Feldman in particular voiced the young Tod and the young Copper. The [[film score|instrumental musical score to the film]] was composed and conducted by [[Buddy Baker (composer)|Buddy Baker]], with Walter Sheets performing the orchestration.\n\nWalt Disney Productions first obtained the film rights to the novel by Daniel P. Mannix in 1967; however, actual development on the film would not occur until spring 1977. ''The Fox and the Hound'' marked the last involvement of the remaining members of [[Disney's Nine Old Men]], which included [[Frank Thomas (animator)|Frank Thomas]] and [[Ollie Johnston]]. Though the old animators had involvement in early development of the film, the film was ultimately handed over to a new generation of animators following the retirement of the old animators. As such, it was the first film for future directors including [[Tim Burton]], [[Brad Bird]], and [[John Lasseter]]. During production, the film's release was delayed by over six months following the abrupt departure of [[Don Bluth]] and his team of animators. Further concerns were raised over the handling of the scene in which Chief is hit by a train, which was changed from his death into a non-fatal injury by which he merely suffers a broken leg.\n\n''The Fox and the Hound'' was released to theaters on July 10, 1981, by [[Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures|Buena Vista Distribution]]. The film was a financial success, becoming the 14th highest-grossing film of the year and earning $39.9 million in the United States. However, it initially received mixed reviews from critics, who praised the animation and voice acting of the film, but believed that the film was not groundbreaking enough. It was nominated for three awards, of which it won one. At the time of its release, it was the most expensive animated film produced to date, costing $12 million.<ref name=\"Newsweek\" /> It was re-released to theaters on March 25, 1988.<ref name=\"D23\" /> An intermediate follow-up, ''[[The Fox and the Hound 2]]'', was released [[direct-to-video|directly-to-DVD]] on December 12, 2006.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature film articles should be between 400 and 700 words in length. Current word count is 470 words. -->\nAfter a young [[red fox]] is orphaned, Big Mama the [[owl]] and her friends, Dinky the [[finch]] and Boomer the [[woodpecker]], arrange for him to be adopted by kindly farmer Widow Tweed, who names him Tod. Meanwhile, her neighbor, hunter Amos Slade, brings home a young [[hound]] puppy named Copper and introduces him to his [[hunting dog]] Chief, who is at first annoyed by him, but then learns to love him. One day, Tod and Copper meet and become best friends, pledging eternal friendship. Amos grows frustrated at Copper for constantly wandering off to play, and places him on a leash. While playing with Copper outside his [[barrel]], Tod accidentally awakens Chief. Amos and Chief chase Tod until they are stopped by Tweed. After an argument, Amos threatens to kill Tod if the fox trespasses on his farm again. Hunting season comes and Amos takes his dogs into the wilderness for the interim. Meanwhile, Big Mama, Dinky, and Boomer attempt to explain to Tod that Copper will soon become his enemy. However, Tod naively insists that he and Copper will remain friends forever.\n\nThe following spring, Tod and Copper reach adulthood. Copper returns as an expert hunting dog, who is expected to track down foxes. Late at night, Tod sneaks over to visit Copper. Their conversation awakens Chief, who alerts Amos. A chase ensues and Copper catches Tod, but lets Tod go while diverting Amos. Chief catches Tod as he attempts an escape on a [[railroad track]], but an oncoming train strikes Chief, resulting in him falling into the river below and breaking his leg. Enraged by this, Copper and Amos blame Tod for the accident and vow vengeance. Realizing Tod is no longer safe with her, Tweed leaves him at a [[game reserve]]. After a disastrous night on his own in the woods, Big Mama introduces Tod to Vixey, a female fox who helps Tod adapt to life in the forest.\n\nAmos and Copper [[trespass to land|trespass into the reserve]] and [[poaching|hunt the two foxes]]. The chase climaxes when Amos and Copper inadvertently provoke an attack from a giant bear. Amos trips and falls into one of his own traps, dropping his gun slightly out of reach. Copper violently fights the bear, but is almost killed by the vicious animal. Tod comes to Copper's rescue and battles the bear until they both fall down a [[waterfall]]. As Copper approaches Tod as he lies wounded in the lake below, Amos appears, ready to shoot Tod. Copper positions himself in front of Tod to prevent Amos from shooting him, refusing to move away. Amos, understanding Tod had saved their lives, lowers his gun and leaves with Copper. Tod and Copper reconcile their friendship and share one last smile before parting. At home, Tweed nurses Amos back to health, much to his humiliation. As he lies down to take a nap, Copper smiles as he remembers the day when he first met Tod. At the same moment, Vixey joins Tod on top of a hill as they both look down on Copper and Tod's former home.\n\n==Voice cast==\n<!-- This list is presented in the order of how it was presented onscreen.

A power struggle between the two directors and co-producer [[Ron W. Miller|Ron Miller]] broke out over key sections of the film with Miller supporting the younger Stevens. Miller instructed Reitherman to surrender reins over to the junior personnel,{{sfn|Hulett|2014|p=33}} but Reitherman resisted due to a lack of trust in the young animators.{{sfn|Beck|2005|p=86}}\n\nIn an earlier version of the film, Chief was slated to die as he did in the novel. However, the scene was modified to have Chief survive with a cast on his back paw. Animator [[Ron Clements]], who had briefly transitioned into the story department, protested: \"Chief has to die. The picture doesn't work if he just breaks his leg. Copper doesn't have motivation to hate the fox.\"{{sfn|Hulett|2014|p=39}} Likewise, younger members of the story team pleaded with Stevens to have Chief killed. Stevens countered, \"Geez, we never killed a main character in a Disney film and we're not starting now!\" The younger crew members took the problem to upper management, who would also back Stevens.{{sfn|Hulett|2014|p=39}} Ollie Johnston's test animation of Chief stomping around the house with his leg in a cast was eventually kept, and [[Randy Cartwright]] re-animated the scene where Copper finds Chief's body and had him animate Chief's eyes opening and closing so the audience knew that he was not dead.<ref name=\"sito\" />\n\nAnother fight erupted when Reitherman, in thinking the film lacked a strong second act, decided to add a musical sequence of two swooping cranes voiced by [[Phil Harris]] and [[Charo]]. These characters would sing a silly song titled \"Scoobie-Doobie Doobie Doo, Let Your Body Turn to Goo\" to Tod after he was dropped in the forest. Charo had recorded the song and several voice tracks which were storyboarded,{{sfn|Koenig|1997|p=168}} and live-action reference footage was shot of her wearing a sweaty pink [[leotard]]. However, the scene was strongly disliked by studio personnel who felt the song was a distraction from the main plot, with Stevens stating \"We can't let that sequence in the movie! It's totally out of place!\"{{sfn|Hulett|2014|p=34}} Stevens notified studio management and after many story conferences, the scene was removed. Reitherman later walked into Stevens's office, slumped in a chair, and said, \"I dunno, Art, maybe this is a young man's medium.\" He later moved on to undeveloped projects such as ''Catfish Bend'' and died in a car accident in 1985.{{sfn|Sito|2006|p=289}}\n\n===Animation===\n[[File:DonBluth.jpg|thumb|right|The departure of [[Don Bluth]], as well as several other animators, caused the film's original release date of Christmas 1980 to be delayed by over six months.]]\nBy late 1978, [[Frank Thomas (animator)|Frank Thomas]], [[Ollie Johnston]], and Cliff Nordberg had completed their animation. Thomas had animated scenes of Tod and Copper using dialogue Larry Clemmons had written and recorded with the child actors.{{sfn|Sito|2006|p=298}} This project would mark the last film to have the involvement of [[Disney's Nine Old Men]] who had retired early during production,<ref name=\"cataroo\">{{cite web|url=https://www.cataroo.com/DBfoxhnd.html|last=Cowley|first=John|title=Don Bluth The Disney Years: Fox and Hound|website=Cataroo|access-date=May 4, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160803111519/http://www.cataroo.com/DBfoxhnd.html|archive-date=August 3, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> and animation was turned over to the next generation of directors and animators, which included [[John Lasseter]], [[John Musker]], [[Ron Clements]], [[Glen Keane]], [[Tim Burton]], [[Brad Bird]], [[Henry Selick]], [[Chris Buck]], [[Mike Gabriel]], and [[Mark Dindal]], all of whom would finalize the animation and complete the film's production. These animators had moved through the in-house animation training program, and would play an important role in the [[Disney Renaissance]] of the 1980s and 1990s.<ref name=finch>{{cite book|last=Finch|first=Christopher|title=The Art of Walt Disney: From Mickey Mouse to the Magic Kingdom|chapter=The End of an Era|publisher=[[Abrams Books|Harry N.

Reitherman had his own ideas on the designs and layouts that should be used, but the newer team backed Stevens. Animator [[Don Bluth]] animated several scenes including of Widow Tweed milking her cow, Abigail, while his team worked on the rest of the sequence, and when Tweed fires at Amos Slade's automobile. Nevertheless, Bluth and the new animators felt that Reitherman was too stern and out of touch,{{sfn|Koenig|1997|p=168}} and on his 42nd birthday, September 13, 1979, Bluth, along with [[Gary Goldman]] and [[John Pomeroy]], entered Ron Miller's office, and they turned in their resignations. Soon after, 13 more animators followed suit in turning in their resignations. Though Bluth and his team had animated substantial scenes, they asked not to receive screen credit.<ref name=\"cataroo\" />\n\nWith those animators now gone,<ref name=\"D23\" /> Miller ordered all of the resigning animators off the studio lot by noon of that same day and would later push the release of ''The Fox and the Hound'' from Christmas 1980 to summer 1981. New animators were hired and promoted to fill the ranks. To compensate for the lack of experience of the new animators, much of the quality control would rely upon a network of veteran assistant animators.{{sfn|Sito|2006|p=290}}<ref name=\"sito\">{{cite web|url=https://www.awn.com/mag/issue3.8/3.8pages/3.8sitofox.html|last=Sito|first=Tom|author-link=Tom Sito|title=Disney's ''The Fox and the Hound'': The Coming of the Next Generation|work=[[Animation World Magazine]]|date=November 1998|access-date=May 4, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160604224711/http://www.awn.com/mag/issue3.8/3.8pages/3.8sitofox.html|archive-date=June 4, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> Four years after production started, the film was finished with approximately 360,000 drawings, 110,000 painted cels and 1,100 painted backgrounds making up the finished product.

The supporting characters were cast by Disney voice regulars including [[Pat Buttram]] for Chief, [[Paul Winchell]] for Boomer, and [[Mickey Rooney]], who had just finished filming ''[[Pete's Dragon (1977 film)|Pete's Dragon]]'' (1977), for adult Tod. [[Jeanette Nolan]] was the second choice for Widow Tweed after [[Helen Hayes]] turned down the part.{{sfn|Hulett|2014|p=35}} The last role to be cast was for adult Copper.

The follow-up was critically panned, with critics calling it a pale imitation of its predecessor.\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n{{refbegin|40em}}\n* {{cite book|last=Beck|first=Jerry|title=The Animated Movie Guide|url=https://archive.org/details/animatedmoviegui0000beck|url-access=registration|publisher=Chicago Reader Press|year=2005|isbn=978-1-556-52591-9}}\n* {{cite book|last=Hulett|first=Steve|title=Mouse In Transition: An Insider's Look at Disney Feature Animation|publisher=Theme Park Press|year=2014|isbn=978-1-941-50024-8}}\n* {{cite book|last=Koenig|first=David|url=https://archive.org/details/mouseunderglasss0000koen|title=Mouse Under Glass: Secrets of Disney Animation & Theme Parks|publisher=Bonaventure Press|isbn=978-0-964-06051-7|year=1997|url-access=registration}}\n* {{Cite book|first=Tom|last=Sito|title=Drawing the Line: The Untold Story of the Animation Unions from Bosko to Bart Simpson|year=2006|publisher=[[University Press of Kentucky]]|isbn=978-0-813-12407-0}}\n{{refend}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Portal|Disney|Film|United States|1980s|Cartoon}}\n{{wikiquote}}\n* {{Official website}}\n* {{IMDb title}}\n* {{tcmdb title}}\n* {{BCDb title}}\n* {{AllMovie title}}\n* {{Mojo title}}\n* {{Rotten Tomatoes}}\n\n{{Disney theatrical animated features}}\n{{Richard Rich}}\n{{Walt Disney Animation Studios}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Fox and the Hound, The}}\n[[Category:1981 films]]\n[[Category:1981 animated films]]\n[[Category:1980s American animated films]]\n[[Category:1980s buddy drama films]]\n[[Category:1980s children's animated films]]\n[[Category:1980s coming-of-age drama films]]\n[[Category:1980s English-language films]]\n[[Category:1981 directorial debut films]]\n[[Category:1981 drama films]]\n[[Category:American buddy drama films]]\n[[Category:American children's animated drama films]]\n[[Category:American coming-of-age drama films]]\n[[Category:Animated buddy films]]\n[[Category:Animated coming-of-age films]]\n[[Category:Animated drama films]]\n[[Category:Animated films about dogs]]\n[[Category:Animated films about foxes]]\n[[Category:Animated films about orphans]]\n[[Category:Animated films based on novels]]\n[[Category:Films about prejudice]]\n[[Category:Films adapted into comics]]\n[[Category:Films based on American novels]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Art Stevens]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Richard Rich]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Ted Berman]]\n[[Category:Films produced by Ron W.
