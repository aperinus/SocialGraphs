It is allegedly based on a true story, although the accuracy of this claim has been disputed. The film was screened out of competition at the [[1985 Cannes Film Festival]].<ref name=\"festival-cannes.com\">{{cite web |url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/928/year/1985.html |title=Festival de Cannes: The Emerald Forest |access-date=8 July 2009|work=festival-cannes.com}}</ref> In promoting the film for awards competition, Boorman created the first [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] [[screener (promotional)|screener]]s, but the film received no Academy Award nominations.<ref name=LosAngelesTimes />\n\n==Plot summary==\nBill Markham ([[Powers Boothe]]) is an engineer who has moved to [[Brazil]] with his family to work on a large hydro-electric dam. The film opens on Markham, his wife Jean ([[Meg Foster]]), his young son Tommy (William Rodriguez), and his daughter Heather (Yara Vaneau) having a picnic on the edge of the jungle, which is being cleared for the dam's construction. Tommy wanders from the cleared area, and an [[Uncontacted peoples|Indian]] (Rui Polanah) from one of the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous tribes]] known as the Invisible People notices Tommy and takes him. Markham pursues the pair into the forest but does not find his son.\n\nTen years later, the dam is nearing completion. A 17-year-old Tommy ([[Charley Boorman]]), now called Tomme, has become one of the Invisible People. When his father, Chief Wanadi, the man who took and adopted Tommy, notices Tomme is now smitten with girls, he initiates Tomme's coming-of-age rite, after which Tomme undergoes a [[vision quest]]. Tomme's [[Power animal|spirit animal]] tells him he must retrieve sacred stones from a remote spot deep in the jungle. Wanadi warns him that the quest will be dangerous, as it will take him into the territory of the cannibalistic [[Yanomami|Fierce People]].\n\nMeanwhile, Markham has finally identified his son's abductors. Markham and a journalist ([[Eduardo Conde]]) decide to set off bottle rockets to attract the attention of the Invisible People. Instead, they attract the Fierce People and are captured. Armed with a [[CAR-15]] carbine, Markham is able to defend himself long enough to talk with Chief Jacareh (Claudio Moreno) who releases Markham for the night, promising to hunt him down in the morning, while the Fierce People kill and butcher the journalist. Close to dawn, Markham stumbles into Tomme collecting the sacred stones. The two recognize each other just as the Fierce People arrive, shooting Markham in the shoulder. Tomme and his father manage to escape, leaving Markham's carbine behind. In the care of the Invisible People, Markham recovers from his injuries and discovers that his son has chosen a wife, a young woman named Kachiri ([[Dira Paes]]).\n\nJacareh, recognizing the destructive power of Markham's carbine, visits a seedy brothel at the edge of the construction zone and arranges to exchange women for ammunition and more guns.\n\nWanadi presides over the wedding, with Markham seated in honour next to the chief; Markham watches as Tomme and Kachiri are wedded; he is still grief-stricken, even still upset with Wanadi, for his son being taken; Markham asks Chief Wanadi why he took Tommy all those years ago. Wanadi answered that he thought the white people must be terribly unhappy, since they were destroying the forest, but Tommy smiled at the Invisible People when he saw them; the Chief took Tommy to save him.\n\nWanadi has Markham given the herb to instigate Markham's own vision quest, and he wakes up back at the dam's construction zone.\n\nTomme and his friends return to their village to discover that many of the Invisible People have been murdered and all the young women abducted by the Fierce People. Tracking the Fierce People, they find their women inside a building protected by unfamiliar, and deadly, technology. In the ensuing battle, the Fierce People kill several members of the Invisible People, including Chief Wanadi. Desperate for help, Tomme navigates the city to his parents' condo, and Markham agrees to help rescue the women from the brothel.\n\nThat night, Markham initiates a shootout in the brothel while Tomme and his friends release the enslaved women from captivity. Tomme is later sworn in as the new chief of the tribe. Markham warns Tomme that the almost-completed dam will end the tribe's way of life, but Tomme insists that the Invisible People are safe and they will ask the wildlife to bring on sufficient rain to break the dam. Markham does not trust that the dam can be broken with any amount of water that the animals can bring, so he decides to \"help\" the cause and destroy the dam himself. During the storm, Markham places demolition explosives at key points along the dam, but just as the detonator fails from a falling piece of equipment, the water breaches and destroys the dam, just as Tomme insisted could happen. Markham watches its destruction with mixed emotions.\n\nThe film ends with Tomme and Kachiri sitting at the swimming hole near their village in the jungle, watching the members of their tribe splash and play.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast list|\n*[[Powers Boothe]] as Bill Markham\n*[[Meg Foster]] as Jean Markham\n*[[Charley Boorman]] as Tomme/Tommy Markham\n**William Rodriguez as Young Tommy Markham\n*Estee Chandler as Heather Markham\n**Yara Vaneau as Young Heather Markham\n*[[Dira Paes]] as Kachiri\n*[[Eduardo Conde]] as Uwe Werner\n*Ariel Coelho as Padre Leduc\n*[[Peter Marinker]] as Perreira\n*Mario Borges as Costa\n*[[\u00c1tila I\u00f3rio]] as Trader\n*Gabriel Archanjo as Trader's Henchman\n*Gracindo J\u00fanior as Carlos\n*Arthur Muhlenberg as Rico\n*Chico Terto as Paulo\n*Claudio Moreno as Jacareh\n}}\n\n===Invisible Tribe===\n{{cast list|\n*Rui Polanah as Wanadi\n*Maria Helena Velasco as Uluru\n*[[Tetchie Agbayani]] as Caya\n*Paulo Vinicius as Mapi\n*Aloiso Flores as Samanpo\n*Joao Mauricio Ca as Monkey\n*Isabel Bicudo as Kachiri's cousin\n*Patricia Prisco as Kachiri's cousin\n*Silvana de Faria as Pequi\n}}\n\n==Production==\n[[Dira Paes]] was chosen after an audition in which she took advantage because she answered the casting director in English.

Times'' article, in fact, he had not, but was simply working from Pallenberg's screenplay. According to SCAN, Boorman told NPR's ''All Things Considered'' that the son was still living with the tribe in 1985, and identified the tribe as \"the [[Mayoruna]]\", yet detailed anthropological studies of that tribe do not mention an adopted outsider.<ref name=\"ellison\"/>\n\nA possible additional source for ''The Emerald Forest'' is the book ''Wizard of the Upper Amazon'' (1971).<ref name=CordovaRios1975>{{cite book |title=Wizard of the upper Amazon: The story of Manuel Cordova-Rios |year=1975 |author-first=Manuel |author-last=Cordova-Rios |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |isbn=0395199190 |edition=2nd}}</ref> The story is an autobiographical account of [[Manuel C\u00f3rdova-Rios]]\u2019 kidnapping when he was a teenager working for rubber cutters in the Amazon in the early 1900s. He was taken by a [[Mats\u00e9s|group of Native Amazonians]] to their remote Indian village. These Amazonians were fiercely independent and had fled into the interior because they refused to live under the subservient conditions imposed by the rubber barons at that time.

Boorman took the initiative to promote the film himself by making [[VHS]] copies available for no charge to [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences|Academy]] members at several [[Los Angeles]]-area video rental stores. Boorman's idea later became ubiquitous during [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]]'s award season, and by the 2010s, more than a million Oscar [[screener (promotional)|screener]]s were mailed to Academy members each year. However, ''Emerald Forest'' itself received no nominations from Boorman's strategy.<ref name=LosAngelesTimes>{{cite web |url=https://www.latimes.com/business/hollywood/la-fi-ct-oscar-screeners-20180301-story.html |title=The Oscar screener was invented by accident, and other secrets of an awards season staple |last=Miller  |first=Daniel  |date=March 1, 2018  |website=The Los Angeles Times  |access-date=March 13, 2018 |quote=\"The Emerald Forest\" didn't get any Oscar nominations \u2014 but Boorman's gambit made an impact: He effectively invented the movie screener, now an integral part of Hollywood's awards season apparatus. }}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of films featuring hallucinogens]]\n*[[Tucuru\u00ed Dam]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*{{cite book\n  | last = Holdstock\n  | first = Robert\n  | author-link = Robert Holdstock\n  | title = John Boorman's the Emerald Forest\n  | publisher = New York Zoetrope\n  | year = 1985\n  | isbn = 978-0-918432-70-4\n  | url-access = registration\n  | url = https://archive.org/details/johnboormansemer00hold\n  }}\n\n*{{cite book\n  | last = Boorman\n  | first = John\n  | author-link = John Boorman\n  | title = Money into Light: The Emerald Forest Diary\n  | publisher = [[Farrar, Straus and Giroux]]\n  | year = 1985\n  | isbn = 978-0-374-14769-3\n  | url-access = registration\n  | url = https://archive.org/details/emeraldforestdia00boor\n  }}\n\n==External links==\n*{{IMDb title|0089087}}\n*{{TCMDb title|74022}}\n*{{Mojo title|emeraldforest}}\n*{{rotten-tomatoes|emerald_forest}}\n*[http://sounds.bl.uk/View.aspx?item=024M-C0095X0197XX-0100V0.xml John Boorman discussing the film and his tie-in book, ''Money into Light''], with [[Philip French]] \u2013 a [[British Library]] recording\n\n{{John Boorman}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Emerald Forest, The}}\n[[Category:1985 films]]\n[[Category:1985 independent films]]\n[[Category:1980s action drama films]]\n[[Category:British drama films]]\n[[Category:British independent films]]\n[[Category:Environmental films]]\n[[Category:Drama films based on actual events]]\n[[Category:Films about child abduction]]\n[[Category:Films about families]]\n[[Category:Films about hunter-gatherers]]\n[[Category:Films about race and ethnicity]]\n[[Category:Films directed by John Boorman]]\n[[Category:Films set in the Amazon]]\n[[Category:Films set in Brazil]]\n[[Category:Films set in jungles]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Rio de Janeiro (city)]]\n[[Category:Indigenous cinema in Latin America]]\n[[Category:1985 drama films]]\n[[Category:1980s English-language films]]\n[[Category:1980s British films]]"}]}}}}
