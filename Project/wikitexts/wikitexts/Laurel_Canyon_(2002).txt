Sam is a recently graduated medical student, starting his [[Residency (medicine)|residency]] in [[psychiatry]], while Alex is finishing her [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] [[dissertation]] on [[genomics]]. The relatively straight-laced, upwardly mobile couple plans to stay at the vacant home of Sam's mother, Jane, a free-spirited record producer in the [[Laurel Canyon, Los Angeles, California|Laurel Canyon]] section of [[Los Angeles]].\n\nIn a change of plans, however, Jane is still around, recording an album with her [[United Kingdom|British]] boyfriend, Ian McKnight, and his band.\n\nJane and Ian are in the midst of a fiery [[romantic love|romance]], and both the producer and the band seem more interested in partying than finishing the record. Jane's presence is a source of consternation for Sam, as he and his mother have quite different mindsets and a strained relationship.\n\nThe new lifestyle options presented by her soon-to-be mother-in-law intrigue the normally hardworking Alex, who begins spending more time with the band and less time on her dissertation. Alex's growing fascination with Jane and Ian leads to a scene where the three of them kiss one another while naked in the swimming pool.\n\nSam himself feels attracted to an [[Israel]]i fellow resident, Sara, who is unapologetically interested in him as well. They share one first kiss while returning from an informal interns' meeting, around the same time Alex has her first tryst with Jane and Ian in the pool. Some time later, while Alex attends Jane and Ian's party held in a crowded hotel suite to celebrate the band's new album release, Sam and Sara meet in a parking lot and, in a conversation filled with sexual tension, they declare their attraction for one another.\n\nThe situation strains Sam and Alex's relationship almost to the point of breaking by the end of the film. After the party has finished and the three of them are left alone in the suite, Ian tries to \"finish\" (in his words) his encounter with Alex and Jane, but the latter decides against it and the [[threesome]] does not take place. Upon returning home after his conversation with Sara, Sam decides to go to the hotel and discovers Jane, Ian, and Alex scantily-clad in the bedroom. In a fit of rage he repeatedly punches Ian, hits his mother with his elbow as she tries to split up the fight, and leaves the hotel, but Alex chases him down the street and professes her love for him.\n\nThe next morning, the situation seems back to normal again. But Sara phones Sam and tells him she can't control her heart, as opposed to what he told her the day before. Sam watches his surroundings, postpones any further conversation, and takes a moment of reflection.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Frances McDormand]] as Jane\n* [[Christian Bale]] as Sam\n* [[Kate Beckinsale]] as Alex\n* [[Natascha McElhone]] as Sara\n* [[Alessandro Nivola]] as Ian McKnight\n* [[Lou Barlow]] as Frip\n* [[Imaad Wasif]] as Dean\n* [[Russell Pollard]] as Rowan\n* [[Mickey Petralia]] as Mickey\n* [[Melissa De Sousa]] as Claudia\n\n==Production==\nCholodenko has said the film was inspired by [[Joni Mitchell]]'s album, ''[[Ladies of the Canyon (album)|Ladies of the Canyon]]''.<ref name=\"TKAA-Focus\">{{cite web |title=Cast & Crew: Lisa Cholodenko, Director/Screenplay |url=http://www.focusfeatures.com/the_kids_are_all_right/castncrew?member=lisa_cholodenko |accessdate=29 October 2013 |work=The Kids Are All Right |publisher=Focus Features}}</ref> The script was workshopped at [[Sundance Institute]]'s lab.<ref name=\"Indiewire-HollywoodHills\">{{cite web |last=Ross |first=Matthew |date=February 27, 2003 |title=The Mystique of The Hollywood Hills; Lisa Cholodenko on \"Laurel Canyon\" |url=http://www.indiewire.com/article/the_mystique_of_the_hollywood_hills_lisa_cholodenko_on_laurel_canyon |accessdate=29 October 2013 |work=IndieWire}}</ref>\n\nThe film focuses in some depth on the challenge of trying to create successful pop music, showing work on two tracks (both actually written, and previously released, by the band [[Sparklehorse]]).<ref>{{Cite web |title=Laurel Canyon soundtrack |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/laurel-canyon-mw0000593687 |website=[[AllMusic]]}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Laurel Canyon |url=https://www.soundtrack.net/album/laurel-canyon/#:~:text=Laurel%20Canyon%20soundtrack%20from%202002%2C%20composed%20by%20Various,from%20Laurel%20Canyon%20%282002%29.%20Laurel%20Canyon%20Soundtrack%20%282002%29 |website=Soundtrack.net}}</ref>\n\n== Reception ==\n''Laurel Canyon'' has a 69% approval rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] from 112 reviews, with an average rating of 6.4/10.
