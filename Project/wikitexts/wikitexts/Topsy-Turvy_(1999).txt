Gilbert]], along with [[Timothy Spall]], [[Lesley Manville]] and [[Ron Cook]]. The story concerns the 15-month period in 1884 and 1885 leading up to the premiere of [[Gilbert and Sullivan]]'s ''[[The Mikado]]''. The film focuses on the creative conflict between playwright and composer, and their decision to continue their partnership, which led to their creation of several more [[Savoy opera]]s.\n\nThe film received very favourable reviews, film festival awards and two [[Academy Awards]] for design. While it is considered an artistic success as an in-depth illustration of British life in the theatre during the [[Victorian era]], the film did not recover its production costs. Leigh cast actors who did their own singing in the film, and the singing performances were faulted by some critics, while others lauded Leigh's strategy.\n\n==Plot==\nOn the opening night of ''[[Princess Ida]]'' at the [[Savoy Theatre]] in January 1884, composer Sir [[Arthur Sullivan]] ([[Allan Corduner]]), ill from [[kidney]] disease, is barely able to make it to the theatre to conduct. He goes on a holiday to [[Continental Europe]] hoping that the rest will improve his health. While he is away, ticket sales and audiences at the Savoy Theatre wilt in the hot summer weather. Producer [[Richard D'Oyly Carte]] ([[Ron Cook]]) has called on Sullivan and the dramatist [[W.S. Gilbert]] ([[Jim Broadbent]]) to create a new piece for the Savoy, but it is not ready when ''Ida'' closes. Until a new piece can be prepared, Carte revives an earlier Gilbert and Sullivan work, ''[[The Sorcerer]]''.\n\nGilbert's idea for their next opera features a transformative magic potion, which Sullivan feels is too similar to the magic lozenge and other magic talismans used in previous operas{{efn|Gilbert and Sullivan's ''[[The Sorcerer]]'' (1877) involved a magic love potion, and several of Gilbert's other works involved various magic devices that transform the possessor. See, e.g., ''[[Dulcamara, or the Little Duck and the Great Quack]]'' (1866).}} and mechanical in its reliance on a supernatural device. Sullivan, under pressure from the British musical establishment to write more serious music, says he longs for something that is \"probable\", involves \"human interest\", and is not dependent on magic. Gilbert sees nothing wrong with his libretto and refuses to write a new one, resulting in a standoff. The impasse is resolved after Gilbert and his wife visit [[Japanese Village, Knightsbridge|a popular exhibition of Japanese arts and crafts]] in [[Knightsbridge]], London.{{efn|This scene in the film is anachronistic: Gilbert is shown in the film visiting the exhibition and getting inspiration for his play, but the real exhibition did not open until January 1885, long after Gilbert sent Sullivan the first plot sketch of ''The Mikado'' in May 1884.}} When the [[katana]] sword he purchases there falls noisily off the wall of his study, he is inspired to write a libretto set in exotic Japan. Sullivan likes the idea and agrees to compose the music for it.\n\nGilbert, Sullivan and Carte work to make ''[[The Mikado]]'' a success, and many glimpses of rehearsals and stressful backstage preparations for the show follow: Cast members lunch together before attempting to negotiate their salaries. Gilbert brings in Japanese girls from the exhibition to teach the ladies' chorus how to walk and use fans in the Japanese manner. The principal cast react to the fittings of their costumes designed by [[William Charles John Pitcher|C. Wilhelm]]. The cast objects to Gilbert's proposed cut of the title character's Act Two solo, \"A more humane Mikado,\" persuading the playwright to restore it. The actors face first-night jitters in their dressing rooms. Finally ''The Mikado'' is ready to open. As is usual for him, Gilbert is too nervous to watch the opening performance and paces the streets of London. Returning to the theatre, he finds that the new opera is a resounding success.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Jim Broadbent]] as [[W. S.

Scenes show [[George Grossmith]]'s use of [[morphine]]; [[Leonora Braham]]'s alcoholism and single motherhood; [[Jessie Bond]]'s health issues, including an abscess on her leg that does not heal; Sullivan's visit to a French brothel and his relationship with his longtime [[mistress (lover)|mistress]], [[Fanny Ronalds]], implying that she obtains an abortion; three actors' discussion of the [[Siege of Khartoum|destruction of the British garrison]] at [[Khartoum]] by the [[Muhammad Ahmad|Mahdi]]; a private salon concert; a conversation about the use of [[nicotine]] by women; and Gilbert being accosted outside the theatre on opening night by an elderly prostitute.
