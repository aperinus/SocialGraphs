The cast also includes [[Kelly Lynch]] as Swayze's love interest and [[Ben Gazzara]] as the main antagonist.\n\n==Plot==\nJames Dalton is a professional \"[[Bouncer (doorman)|cooler]]\", with a mysterious past who is enticed from his job in New York City by Frank Tilghman to take over security at his own club, the Double Deuce, in [[Jasper, Missouri]]. Tilghman plans to invest substantial money into the club to enhance its image, and he needs a first-rate cooler to maintain stability. Handed control of all bar operations and hiring by Frank, Dalton fires multiple employees for theft and drug dealing.\n\nDalton is introduced to local business magnate Brad Wesley, who effectively controls the town. His henchmen threaten Tilghman, and during the ensuing struggle Dalton receives a knife wound. At the hospital, he begins a friendship with Dr. Elizabeth \"Doc\" Clay, which develops into a romance. Dalton also reunites with his mentor, aging cooler Wade Garrett, who comes in to town after receiving a disconcerting phone call from Dalton.\n\nWesley summons Dalton to his home and reveals knowledge of Dalton's past regarding an incident in which he killed a man in self-defense. Wesley tries to convince Dalton to work for him once he extorts the Double Deuce. Dalton refuses and Wesley increases his attack on the club as well as beginning to sabotage other businesses that start disobeying him. After Wesley's henchman Jimmy Reno sets Dalton's house on fire, he kills him in self-defense, shocking Elizabeth.\n\nAfter Wesley has Garrett killed, Dalton snaps and storms Wesley's estate, killing most of his henchmen and ultimately incapacitating Wesley. As he tries to walk away, Wesley pulls a gun on him. Before Wesley can shoot, however, he is shot to death by the townspeople, who deny any knowledge of what had happened to the arriving police. In the end, the town celebrates its newfound freedom at the Double Deuce.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Patrick Swayze]] as James Dalton\n* [[Kelly Lynch]] as Dr. Elizabeth \"Doc\" Clay\n* [[Sam Elliott]] as Wade Garrett\n* [[Ben Gazzara]] as Brad Wesley\n* [[Kevin Tighe]] as Frank Tilghman\n* [[Red West]] as Red Webster\n* [[Jeff Healey]] as Cody\n* [[Sunshine Parker|\"Sunshine\" Parker]] as Emmett\n* [[Marshall Teague (actor)|Marshall Teague]] as Jimmy Reno\n* [[John Doe (musician)|John Doe]] as Pat McGurn\n* [[Kathleen Wilhoite]] as Carrie Ann\n* [[Terry Funk]] as Morgan\n* [[Anthony De Longis]] as Gary Ketchum\n* Travis McKenna as Jack\n* [[Keith David]] as Ernie Bass, New Bartender\n* John William Young as Tinker\n}}\n\n==Production==\n\n===Casting===\n[[Annette Bening]] was originally cast as Dr. Elizabeth Clay but she was fired because she and Patrick Swayze had no chemistry, so she was replaced by Kelly Lynch.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.avclub.com/kelly-lynch-on-magic-city-john-hughes-and-playing-a-d-1798234234|title=Kelly Lynch on Magic City, John Hughes, and playing a drag king|website=[[The A.V.

The sequel confirmed that Dalton's first name was James, which could be seen momentarily on the medical chart in the original film's hospital scene, but which had been otherwise left unsaid. At the same time ''Road House 2'' was released, the original film was reissued in a deluxe edition featuring, among other features, separate audio commentary tracks by director Herrington, [[Kevin Smith]], and [[Scott Mosier]], which the duo had expressed an interest in during the introduction of the tenth anniversary ''[[Clerks (1994 film)|Clerks]]'' DVD.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.whatdvd.net/FilmReview.asp?FilmReview=937 |title=Road House: Deluxe Edition |website=WhatDVD.net |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928171915/http://www.whatdvd.net/FilmReview.asp?FilmReview=937 |archive-date=September 28, 2007 }}</ref>\n\n===Musical===\nIn 2003, an [[Off Broadway|off-Broadway]] musical production of ''Road House'' was staged as a [[Camp (style)|campy]] comedy by [[Timothy Haskell]], as seen by its full title of ''Road House: The Stage Version Of The Cinema Classic That Starred Patrick Swayze, Except This One Stars [[Taimak]] From The 80's Cult Classic \"''[[The Last Dragon]]''\" Wearing A Blonde Mullet Wig''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://eljallartsannex.com/Road%20House.htm |title=Road House |publisher=Eljallartsannex.com |access-date=2014-06-13 |archive-date=November 22, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121122092642/http://www.eljallartsannex.com/Road%20House.htm |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n===Police training video===\nFollowing the [[death of Eric Garner]], the [[New York City Police Department]] began using a scene from ''Road House'' as part of a mandatory, three-day retraining course for 22,000 officers expected to \"be nice\" under pressure.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://nypost.com/2015/02/24/nypd-using-road-house-movie-to-teach-cops-how-to-be-nice/ | work=New York Post | first1=Larry | last1=Celona | first2=Bruce | last2=Golding | title=NYPD using 'Road House' movie to teach cops how to 'be nice' | date=2015-02-24 | access-date=December 9, 2017 | archive-date=October 14, 2017 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171014080617/http://nypost.com/2015/02/24/nypd-using-road-house-movie-to-teach-cops-how-to-be-nice/ | url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n===Remake===\n{{Main|Road House (upcoming film)}}\nOn September 9, 2015, it was announced that [[Ronda Rousey]] would star in a remake of ''Road House''.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://comicbook.com/2015/09/09/ronda-rousey-to-star-in-road-house-reboot/ |title=Ronda Rousey To Star in Road House Reboot |publisher=comicbook.com |author=Brandon Davis |date=September 9, 2015 |access-date=September 9, 2015 |archive-date=September 11, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150911020639/http://comicbook.com/2015/09/09/ronda-rousey-to-star-in-road-house-reboot/ |url-status=live }}</ref> On October 12, 2015, [[Nick Cassavetes]] was announced to write and direct the film.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://variety.com/2015/film/news/nick-cassavetes-road-house-ronda-rousey-120161027|title=Nick Cassavetes to Write, Direct Ronda Rousey's Road House |publisher=Variety |last=Kroll |first=Justin |date=October 12, 2015}}</ref> However, plans for the film fell through and the remake was quietly canceled in 2016.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://screenrant.com/terrible-amazing-canceled-remakes-movies/ |title=9 Canceled Remakes That Would've Been Terrible (And 6 That Would've Been Amazing) |author=Leon Miller |date=December 15, 2017 |website=Screen Rant |access-date=March 9, 2019 |archive-date=February 2, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190202210359/https://screenrant.com/terrible-amazing-canceled-remakes-movies/ |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nIn November 2021, it was reported that [[Jake Gyllenhaal]] was in talks to star in a remake of ''Road House'' by [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] with [[Doug Liman]] directing.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Murphy|first1=J.
