At a family meeting, he announces he is taking his youngest son Conor out of his expensive school and moving him to a Christian Brothers school, [[Synge Street CBS]], which Robert asserts is of equally high repute. Conor's older brother Brendan ribs him about the change as well as about the state of the family unit.\n\nConor appears in his new uniform but without the regulation black shoes. The school principal, Br. Baxter, chastises him despite Conor's pleas of being unable to afford new shoes. To avoid going shoeless, he paints his shoes black. An encounter with the school bully, Barry, introduces Conor to Darren, an ally and budding entrepreneur. When Conor recruits aspiring model Raphina for a music video, Darren agrees to manage his band and introduces him to multi-instrumentalist Eamon.\n\nThe band practices in Eamon's living room, playing covers until Brendan encourages him to develop the band's own style. He writes original songs with Eamon, describing themselves as \"futurists\". The band films their first music video wearing comical costumes; Raphina acts as [[ing\u00e9nue]] and makeup artist. Conor goes into school the next day wearing make up, and Baxter forcibly removes it. Raphina gives Conor his nickname \"Cosmo\", which she says is more in keeping with his new band's image. After spending the day filming a music video for a new song, Conor and Raphina kiss. Conor also stands up to Barry by pointing out the insignificance of both their lives, which greatly upsets Barry.\n\nRobert and Penny's marriage falls apart while Raphina and Conor's relationship blossoms. Conor takes Raphina out to [[Dalkey Island]] in his granddad's motor cruiser. Here, they view the [[Roll-on/roll-off|car ferry]] leaving [[D\u00fan Laoghaire]] for Britain and discuss Raphina's dream of leaving Ireland for [[London]].\n\nConor, Raphina and the band prepare to film a ''[[Back to the Future]]''-inspired music video for their new song, but Conor is disheartened when Raphina fails to show up. She reveals that she was set to leave for London with her boyfriend, but he abandoned her. Hurt by her lack of disclosure and offended by her nonchalance, Conor breaks up with Raphina. Because of the break-up and his family's problems, Conor finds difficulty in writing or playing music, but Brendan urges Conor to continue so he can make a better future for himself. Penny and Robert announce to the family that they are getting legally separated and selling the house. Penny plans on moving in with her affair and boss, Tommy, whilst Robert plans on getting a small apartment. They will share custody. An opportunity arises for the band to play live at an end-of-year party at school. Conor strikes up a friendship with Barry, offering him the chance to be the band's roadie and escape his abusive family.\n\nConor prepares a new song mocking Baxter, which the band perform as an encore while distributing homemade masks of Baxter's face. Raphina arrives before the band finishes and reconciles with Conor. Both of them leave the party and the school in uproar. After secretly saying goodbye to his family later that night, Conor and Raphina persuade Brendan to drive them to Dalkey, so they can escape in the motor cruiser and head to London. Brendan agrees and drives them to the harbour, where Brendan and Conor embrace. Conor and Raphina sail out to sea, following the ferry across the rough [[Irish Sea]] to a new life in London. Brendan watches them disappear into the distance and cheers, overjoyed that his younger brother has left to go on to greater things.\n\n==Cast==\n<!--- [[WP:NOTDATABASE]] - first six cast and order per opening stand-alone credits, plus Sing Street band and constant bully and lead teachers, roles per closing credits scroll --->\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Lucy Boynton]] as Raphina\n* [[Maria Doyle Kennedy]] as Penny\n* [[Aidan Gillen]] as Robert\n* [[Jack Reynor]] as Brendan\n* [[Kelly Thornton]] as Ann\n* [[Ferdia Walsh-Peelo]] as Conor\n* Ben Carolan as Darren\n* [[Mark McKenna]] as Eamon\n* [[Jafaris|Percy Chamburuka]] as Ngig\n* Conor Hamilton as Larry\n* Karl Rice as Garry\n* Ian Kenny as Barry\n* [[Don Wycherley]] as Brother Baxter\n* Lydia McGuinness as Miss Dunne\n}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nIn February 2014, it was announced that [[John Carney (director)|John Carney]] would be directing the film, from a screenplay he wrote about a boy starting a band in order to impress a girl.

As Carney has proved previously, he knows how to straddle the line between the sound in the room and the sound in your head \u2013 a sequence that segues from bedroom composition to living room rehearsal (with tea and biscuits) to full studio production perfectly negotiates the space between kitchen-sink realism and musical fantasy in which this lovely, lyrical movie casts its spell\".
