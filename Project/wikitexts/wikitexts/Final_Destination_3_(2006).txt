A [[standalone sequel]] to ''[[Final Destination 2]]'' (2003), it is the third installment in the [[Final Destination|''Final Destination'' film series]]. Wong and [[Glen Morgan]], who worked on the franchise's [[Final Destination (film)|first film]], wrote the screenplay. ''Final Destination 3'' stars [[Mary Elizabeth Winstead]] and [[Ryan Merriman]], and takes place years after the first film. Winstead plays [[Wendy Christensen]], a high school graduate who has a [[precognition|premonition]] that a roller coaster she and her classmates are riding will derail. Although she saves some of them, [[Death (personification)|Death]] begins hunting the survivors. Wendy realizes photographs she took at the [[amusement park]] contain clues about her classmates' death. With survivor and friend Kevin Fischer (Merriman), Wendy tries to use this knowledge to save the rest of them and ruin Death's scheme.\n\nThe film's development began shortly after the release of ''Final Destination 2''; [[Jeffrey Reddick]], creator of the franchise and a co-writer of the first two films, did not return for the third one. Unlike the second film, which was a direct sequel to the first, the producers envisioned ''Final Destination 3'' as a stand-alone film. The idea of featuring a roller coaster derailment as the opening-scene disaster came from [[New Line Cinema]] executive Richard Bryant. From the beginning, Wong and Morgan saw [[locus of control|control]] as a major theme in the film. Casting began in March 2005 and concluded in April. Like the previous two installments, it was filmed in [[Vancouver|Vancouver, Canada]]. The first two weeks of the three-month shoot were spent filming the roller coaster's derailment.\n\nFollowing its premiere at [[Grauman's Chinese Theatre]] on February 2, 2006, the film was released in cinemas in the United States on February 10, 2006. The DVD, released on July 25, 2006, includes commentaries, documentaries, a deleted scene and an animated video. A special-edition DVD called \"Thrill Ride Edition\" includes a feature called \"Choose Their Fate\", which acts as an [[interactive film]], allowing viewers to make decisions at specific points in the film that alter the course of the story.\n\n''Final Destination 3'' received a mixed critical response. The film was a financial success and, with box office receipts of nearly $118 million, the highest-grossing installment in the franchise at the time. A fourth film, ''[[The Final Destination]]'', was released in August 2009.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 2005, high school student [[Wendy Christensen]] visits an amusement park in Pennsylvania with her boyfriend [[List of Final Destination characters#Jason Wise|Jason Wise]], her best friend [[List of Final Destination characters#Carrie Dreyer|Carrie Dreyer]], Carrie's boyfriend [[List of Final Destination characters#Kevin Fischer|Kevin Fischer]], and their classmates to celebrate their graduation. As they board the Devil's Flight roller coaster, Wendy has a premonition that the hydraulics securing the [[Train_(roller_coaster)#Restraints|restraints]] and train cars will fail during the ride, killing everyone on board. She convinces nine people including Kevin, best friends [[List of Final Destination characters#Ashley Freund and Ashlyn Halperin|Ashley Freund and Ashlyn Halperin]], alumnus [[List of Final Destination characters#Frankie Cheeks|Frankie Cheeks]], athlete [[List of Final Destination characters#Lewis Romero|Lewis Romero]], and goth couple [[List of Final Destination characters#Ian McKinley|Ian McKinley]] and [[List of Final Destination characters#Erin Ulmer|Erin Ulmer]], not to ride the roller coaster, but fails to save Jason and Carrie, who are among the remaining passengers killed in the derailment.\n\nSeveral weeks later, Kevin tells Wendy about [[Final Destination (film)|the explosion of Flight 180 and the survivors' subsequent deaths]], believing they may be in a similar situation. At a tanning salon, Ashley and Ashlyn are burnt alive in malfunctioning tanning beds. Now convinced that [[Death (personification)|Death]] is stalking them, Wendy and Kevin set out to save the remaining survivors using omens hidden in photographs of the survivors that Wendy took on the night of the roller coaster crash. When Wendy and Kevin pull into a drive-thru restaurant and observe Frankie's photo, a runaway [[semi-trailer truck]] forces them to escape Kevin's car before it collides. The collision causes the car's motor to fly out and kill Frankie, who was in the car in front of them, by slicing his skull.\n\nThe next day, Wendy and Kevin fail to save Lewis, whose head is crushed by two weights from a [[Bowflex]] machine at the school gym. They find Ian and Erin working at a hardware store, where a chain reaction from a runaway forklift allows Wendy to save Ian from his death. However, Death skips to Erin, who falls on a nail gun that shoots repeatedly through her head. While identifying the last two survivors from the photographs, whose faces are obscured, Wendy realizes that they are her sister [[List of Final Destination characters#Julie Christensen|Julie]] and one of her friends, prompting Wendy and Kevin to rush to the local tricentennial fair to save them. Kevin saves Julie from being impaled on a [[Harrow (tool)|harrow]], but an airborne flagpole fatally impales Julie's friend [[List of Final Destination characters#Perry Malinowski|Perry Malinowski]] moments later. After Wendy saves Kevin from an exploding propane canister, the trio is confronted by a grief-stricken Ian, who blames Wendy for Erin's death, until an unstable cart of firework cannons launches into a cherry picker that falls and crushes him.\n\nFive months later, Wendy experiences more omens while riding on a subway train with her roommate Laura and her friend Sean. As Wendy is about to disembark, she suddenly reunites with Julie and Kevin, who had also boarded the train. Wendy receives another premonition that the train will crash, killing everyone on board. Panicked, the remaining survivors attempt to stop the train as it is about to crash, leaving their fates unknown.\n\n==Cast==\n{{for|more details on the characters|List of Final Destination characters}}\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Mary Elizabeth Winstead]] as [[Wendy Christensen]]\n* [[Ryan Merriman]] as Kevin Fischer\n* [[Kris Lemche]] as Ian McKinley\n* [[Alexz Johnson]] as Erin Ulmer\n* [[Sam Easton]] as Frankie Cheeks\n* [[Jesse Moss (actor)|Jesse Moss]] as Jason Wise\n* [[Gina Holden]] as Carrie Dreyer\n* [[Texas Battle]] as Lewis Romero\n* [[Chelan Simmons]] as Ashley Freund\n* [[Crystal Lowe]] as Ashlyn Halperin\n* [[Amanda Crew]] as Julie Christensen\n* Maggie Ma as Perry Malinowski\n* [[Ecstasia Sanders]] as Amber Regan\n* [[Patrick Gallagher (actor)|Patrick Gallagher]] as Colquitt\n* [[Andrew Francis]] as Payton\n* [[Cory Monteith]] as Kahill\n* [[Dustin Milligan]] as Marcus\n* [[Tony Todd]] as the Devil (voice) / subway train conductor (voice)\n* [[Agam Darshi]] as Laura\n* Dylan Basile as Sean\n}}\n\n==Production==\n\n===Development===\n''Final Destination 3'' was originally the last part of a trilogy and had been in development since the release of ''[[Final Destination 2]]''.<ref name =\"Wong\"/> Franchise creator [[Jeffrey Reddick]] and one of the co-writers of the first two films did not return for the third installment.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Murrian |first1=Samuel R. |title=''Final Destination'' Creator Jeffrey Reddick on His New Thriller ''Dead Awake'' |url=https://parade.com/569683/samuelmurrian/final-destination-creator-jeffrey-reddick-on-his-new-thriller-dead-awake/ |magazine=[[Parade (magazine)|Parade]] |access-date=August 7, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170807173445/https://parade.com/569683/samuelmurrian/final-destination-creator-jeffrey-reddick-on-his-new-thriller-dead-awake/ |archive-date=7 August 2017 |date=11 May 2017 |url-status=live}}</ref> Director [[James Wong (filmmaker)|James Wong]] said that unlike the second film, which was closely tied to the first and continued its story, the producers always envisioned ''Final Destination 3'' as a stand-alone sequel featuring new characters.<ref name =\"Wong\">{{cite news |last1=Orange |first1=B.

A standard CGI body of Lemche's height was used; several animation simulations of the body being crushed with a CGI object were filmed. The director chose the version he liked most.
