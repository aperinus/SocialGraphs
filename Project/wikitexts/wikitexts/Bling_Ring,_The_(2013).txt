It is based on the 2010 ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' article \"The Suspects Wore [[Christian Louboutin#Shoes|Louboutins]]\" by [[Nancy Jo Sales]], which dealt with a real-life gang known as the [[Bling Ring]]. The story follows a group of fame-obsessed teenagers who use the internet to track celebrities' whereabouts in order to burgle their homes.\n\nThe film was an [[international co-production]] by producers in the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, and Japan. Coppola began developing a screenplay based on the real-life burglaries in December 2011. Casting took place in early 2012, and [[principal photography]] started in March of that same year in [[Los Angeles, California]].\n\n''The Bling Ring'' had its world premiere on May 1, 2013, in the [[Un Certain Regard]] section of the [[2013 Cannes Film Festival]].<ref name=\"Cannes\">{{cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2013/04/bling-ring-cannes-2013-un-certain-regard-opening-film/|title='Bling Ring' Will Open Cannes' Un Certain Regard Sidebar|website=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|date=April 17, 2013|access-date=April 18, 2013}}</ref> In the United States, it had a [[limited theatrical release]] by [[A24]] on June 14, 2013, before opening [[wide release|wide]] one week later. It received generally positive reviews from critics, with many praising the cast and Coppola's \"stylish\" direction; Watson in particular received critical acclaim for her performance.

Soon after arriving, he is befriended by fame-obsessed Rebecca Ahn. While at a party at her house, Rebecca persuades Marc to sneak away with her, and the pair check the doors of cars on the street, taking valuables such as cash and credit cards from unlocked vehicles. They begin hanging out after school, and Marc starts to see Rebecca as a sister figure.\n\nOne day, Rebecca asks Marc if he knows anyone who is out of town, and he mentions that a wealthy acquaintance is in Jamaica. She convinces Marc to join her in breaking into the empty house, where she steals a handbag similar to one that her idol [[Lindsay Lohan]] has, cash, and the keys to a [[Porsche]], which the pair use to flee the scene. They go on a shopping spree with the money, buying themselves luxury items like the ones they have previously admired in magazines.\n\nMarc visits a nightclub with Rebecca and her friends (who include Nicki Moore, Nicki's adoptive sister Sam, and Chloe Tainer), where they ogle celebrities [[Kirsten Dunst]] and [[Paris Hilton]]. Later, while researching Hilton on the internet, Marc and Rebecca realize she is out of town. They find her address, go to her house, and, upon finding a key under the doormat, [[Breaking and entering|break in]]. They go through Hilton's belongings and take some jewelry with them, including a bracelet that Rebecca later flaunts to Nicki, Sam, and Chloe at a party.\n\nAt Nicki's request, Rebecca and Marc take her, Sam, and Chloe back to Hilton's house. The group marvels at the excess of Hilton's lifestyle and steals shoes, bags, dresses, cash, and jewelry. A drunk Chloe gets into an accident while driving away; she is arrested and sentenced to community service.\n\nMarc and Rebecca return to rob Hilton's house on a third occasion and are nearly discovered by security. They then rob the home of [[Audrina Patridge]], using the internet to determine when she will not be home. The group sells unwanted bags and other items at an outdoor market.\n\nThe entire group burgles the home of [[Megan Fox]], wherein Nicki's younger sister Emily squeezes through a [[pet door]] to gain access to the house. Nicki discovers a handgun inside, and Sam playfully threatens Marc with it before taking it to her boyfriend Rob's home. When he grabs her, the gun goes off, though no one is injured.\n\nThe group enters the home of [[Orlando Bloom]] and his girlfriend, [[Miranda Kerr]]. The girls steal various items and Marc finds a case filled with seven of Bloom's [[Rolex watches]] and a roll of cash. Chloe helps Marc sell the watches to her friend Ricky, a night club manager. The teens later return to Hilton's house with Rob, who finds and steals large amounts of jewelry.\n\nA news report containing [[Closed-circuit television|security]] footage from the robbery at Patridge's home concerns Marc, but Rebecca is undeterred. She instigates a burglary at the home of [[Rachel Bilson]], and the group ultimately breaks into Lohan's house and robs it. Shortly thereafter, Rebecca moves to Las Vegas with her father, ostensibly due to troubles at home, leaving some of her stolen items with Marc.\n\nMedia coverage of the [[Hollywood Hills]] burglaries intensifies, and the group acquires the label \"The Bling Ring\". Authorities ultimately identify the group using security footage from several robberies, statements from members of the group's social circle who heard its members brag about their exploits at drug-fueled parties, and photographs of the stolen items posted by the group on social media sites. Marc, Nicki, Chloe, Rebecca, Rob, and Ricky are arrested; Sam was not caught on camera and is able to avoid suspicion.\n\nA remorseful Marc cooperates with the police, informing them of details of the burglaries, much to the chagrin of Rebecca, whom he identifies as the ringleader. A ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' journalist interviews Marc, still apparently exhibiting regret for his actions, but amazed at how much attention he has gotten, and Nicki, who claims the others were at fault and she is a religious humanitarian. When the group is prosecuted, they receive varying amounts of jail time and are ordered to pay millions of dollars in [[restitution]] for the stolen items. Marc is transported to prison, alone among various older criminals.\n\nIn the final scene, Nicki recounts her 30 days in jail on a talk show and reveals that Lohan was in the same facility at the same time. She then turns to the camera and promotes her website, where people can learn everything about her \"journey\".\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Israel Broussard]] as Marc Hall (based on [[Bling Ring#Nick Prugo|Nick Prugo]])\n* [[Katie Chang]] as Rebecca Ahn (based on [[Bling Ring#Rachel Lee|Rachel Lee]])\n* [[Emma Watson]] as Nicolette \"Nicki\" Moore (based on [[Alexis Neiers]])\n* [[Taissa Farmiga]] as Sam Moore (based on Tess Taylor)\n* [[Claire Julien]] as Chloe Tainer (based on [[Bling Ring#Courtney Ames|Courtney Ames]])\n* Carlos Miranda as Rob Hernandez (based on [[Bling Ring#Roy Lopez Jr.|Roy Lopez, Jr.]])\n* [[Gavin Rossdale]] as Ricky (based on [[Bling Ring#Johnny Ajar|Johnny Ajar]])\n* [[Leslie Mann]] as Laurie Moore (based on [[Andrea Arlington-Dunn]])\n* Georgia Rock as Emily Moore (based on Gabby Neiers and Diana Tamayo)\n* Annie Fitzgerald as Kate (based on [[Nancy Jo Sales]])\n* [[Stacy Edwards]] as Mrs. Hall\n* G.
