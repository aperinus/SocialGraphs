The larger lamp, named Luxo Sr., looks on while the smaller, \"younger\" [[Luxo Jr. (character)|Luxo Jr]]. plays exuberantly with a ball to the extent that it accidentally deflates. ''Luxo Jr.'' was Pixar's first animation after [[Edwin Catmull|Ed Catmull]] and John Lasseter left [[Industrial Light & Magic]]'s computer division of Cinetron Computer Systems. The film is the source of Luxo Jr., the mascot of Pixar.\n\nLasseter aimed to finish the short film for the 1986 [[SIGGRAPH]], an annual computer graphics conference attended by thousands of industry professionals. The film would come from his experiments with modeling his [[Luxo]] lamp. Lasseter worked to improve the story within the allotted two minutes. In animation, the film demonstrates the use of [[shadow map]]s within the rendering software. Lasseter applied the classic animation principles popularized by [[Disney's Nine Old Men]] to convey the lamps' emotions. Catmull and Lasseter worked around the clock, and Lasseter even took a sleeping bag into work and slept under his desk, ready to work early the next morning.<ref name=\"The Pixar Story 2007\">The Pixar Story (2007) (TV documentary)</ref> Ultimately, the film took four and a half months to be completed.<ref>[https://design.osu.edu/carlson/history/tree/related%20materials/08stry1.html Feature: Toy Story: A Triumph of Animation]</ref>\n\nThe short film was finished in time for it to be shown at SIGGRAPH.

Please do not add excessive detail or informally used words. They will be removed.-->\nIn a dark room, a large illuminated balanced-arm desk lamp named Luxo Sr. sees a small yellow ball with a blue stripe and a red star on the front roll-up to him. He eyes the ball curiously and pushes it away, but the ball comes back to him. He pushes it away again, but it rolls past him as Luxo Jr., his happy and excited son, hops over and plays with the ball. Luxo Jr. then balances himself on top of the ball and bounces on it excessively, causing it to deflate. Luxo Jr. flips the deflated ball onto its side and looks up at Luxo Sr., who gently admonishes his son. Luxo Jr. then hops offscreen in shame but is later seen playing with a [[beach ball]]. Luxo Sr. looks at the camera, then shakes his head in embarrassment.\n\n==Background==\nThe Graphics Group, which was one-third of the Computer Division of [[Lucasfilm]], had been associating with [[Industrial Light & Magic]] on computer-generated graphics in the early 1980s. In 1984, the group produced an animated short titled ''[[The Adventures of Andr\u00e9 & Wally B.]]'', which premiered at the annual SIGGRAPH conference to great fanfare. The group, which numbered 40 individuals,<ref name=\"Pixar Founding Documents\">{{cite web|url=http://alvyray.com/pixar/default.htm |title=Pixar Founding Documents |publisher=Alvy Ray Smith |access-date=January 11, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050427012806/http://alvyray.com/Pixar/default.htm |archive-date=April 27, 2005 }}</ref> was spun out as a corporation in February 1986 with investment by [[Steve Jobs]] shortly after he left [[Apple Inc.|Apple Computer]].<ref name=\"Pixar Founding Documents\" /> Jobs paid $5&nbsp;million to [[George Lucas]] for technology rights and put them and $5&nbsp;million cash as capital into the company.<ref name=\" Pixar Founding Documents\" /> A factor contributing to Lucas' sale was an increase in cash flow difficulties following his 1983 divorce, which coincided with the sudden dropoff in revenues from ''[[Star Wars]]'' licenses following the release of ''[[Return of the Jedi]]''. The newly independent company was headed by Dr. Edwin Catmull as president and [[Alvy Ray Smith|Dr. Alvy Ray Smith]] as Executive Vice President. They were joined on the Board of Directors by Steve Jobs who was chairman.<ref name=\" Pixar Founding Documents\" />\n\nPixar's small animation department\u2014consisting of Lasseter, plus the part-time supporting efforts of several graphics scientists\u2014was never meant to generate any revenue as far as Jobs was concerned.<ref name=\" PixarTouch01\">Price, p. 89</ref> Catmull and Smith justified its existence on the basis that more films at SIGGRAPH like ''Andr\u00e9 and Wally B.'' would promote the company's computers. The group had no film at SIGGRAPH the preceding year, its last year under Lucas's wing, apart from a stained-glass knight sequence they produced for ''[[Young Sherlock Holmes]]''. Catmull was determined that Pixar would have a film to show at its first SIGGRAPH as an independent company in August 1986.<ref name=\" PixarTouch01\" /> ''Luxo Jr.'' was produced by Pixar employee [[John Lasseter]] as a demonstration of the Pixar Image Computer's capabilities.\n\nTwo other short animations by two of the company's graphics experts were in production during the time in which ''Luxo Jr.'' was conceived. Bill Reeves, who was interested in algorithms to re-create the turbulence of ocean waves, made ''[[Flags and Waves]]'', with waves reflecting a sunset and lapping against the shore.<ref name=\" PixarTouch03\" /> Eben Ostby, a [[Brown University|Brown]] architecture major turned graphics programmer, made ''[[Beach Chair (film test)|Beach Chair]]'', starring a chair that walked across the sand and nervously approached the water, dipped its front legs in just far enough to test the temperature, then scurried along. Reeves and Ostby also assisted Lasseter with model making and rendering on the short film.<ref name=\" PixarTouch03\" />\n\n==Production==\nLasseter's student film at [[CalArts]], ''The Lady and the Lamp'' (1979), applied [[Walt Disney]]'s observation that giving lifelike qualities to inanimate objects held comic potential. ''Luxo Jr.'' displayed a further insight, however: that inanimate objects as characters held the potential for dramatic value as well.<ref name=\" PixarTouch04\"/> The film would come from Lasseter's experiments with modeling his Luxo lamp.<ref name=\" PixarTouch02\"/> He had felt an inspiration strike when fellow employee [[Thomas Porter (Pixar)|Tom Porter]] brought his infant son Spencer to work one day and Lasseter, playing with the child, became fascinated with his proportions. A baby's head was huge compared with the rest of its body, Lasseter realized. It struck Lasseter as humorous and he began to wonder what a young lamp would look like.<ref name=\" PixarTouch02\"/> He fiddled with the dimensions of all the parts of his Luxo model\u2014all but the bulb since lightbulbs come from a store and don't grow, he reasoned\u2014and he emerged with a second character, Luxo Jr.<ref name=\" PixarTouch02\">Price, p. 90</ref>\n\nLasseter initially intended the film as a plotless character study. When he showed some early tests at an animation festival in [[Brussels]], respected Belgian animator [[Raoul Servais]] exhorted him, \"No matter how short it is, it should have a beginning, a middle, and an end. Don't forget the story.\" Lasseter protested that the film would be too short for a story. \"You can tell a story in ten seconds\", Servais responded.<ref name=\" PixarTouch02\"/> Lasseter was convinced. He devised a simple plotline in which the two lamps would play a game of catch with an inflated ball; Luxo Jr. would then approach the ball, hop onto it, bounce until the ball popped under him, and show dejection as the parent lamp looked on. Finally, Luxo Jr. would reappear feeling excited with a new, larger ball. Among the films shown at SIGGRAPH in 1985, Lasseter particularly admired a piece of character animation called ''[[Tony de Peltrie]]'', from a group at the [[University of Montreal]]; it featured a strikingly expressive human character, an aging piano player who entertained while inwardly reflecting on better days, which inspired ''Luxo Jr.''<ref name=\" PixarTouch01\"/>\n\nApart from the film's hoped-for promotional value, Catmull and Smith rationalized the project as a test of \"self-shadowing\" in the rendering software- that is, the ability of objects to shed light and shadows on themselves.<ref name=\" PixarTouch02\"/> Before self-shadowing, CGI shadows were made by adding a flattened and darkened version of the shadowed object.<ref name=\"Paik, K. 2007\"/>\nOn the [[computer graphics|technical]] level, the film demonstrates the use of [[shadow map]]s to simulate the shifting light and shadow given by the animated lamps.<ref name=fo>Foley, J.

The background would be plain black and there would be no camera movement. His energies would rather be focused instead on working out techniques based on classic animation principles to convey emotion.<ref name=\" PixarTouch02\"/> Even though the characters were faceless and wordless, Lasseter shaped such subtleties as the speed of the child's hops and the way it carried its head to convey in an instant when the child was feeling joy and when it was feeling sad. At every moment, the parent and child seemed to have a definite frame of mind.<ref name=\" PixarTouch03\">Price, p. 91</ref> On the [[film|cinematic]] level, it demonstrates a simple and entertaining story, including effectively expressive individual characters.<ref>Courrier, K.

More significant than its [[photorealism]], however, was its emotional realism. \"It was perhaps the first computer-animated film that enabled viewers to forget they were watching computer animation\", wrote Price.<ref name=\" PixarTouch04\"/>\n\nAfterward, Lasseter saw [[Jim Blinn]], a longtime professional colleague, approaching him, obviously readying a question. Lasseter braced for a question about the shadowing algorithm or some other recondite technical issue that he knew equally little about.<ref name=\" PixarTouch04\"/> Blinn instead asked whether the big lamp was the mother or the father. Although the memories of those involved are now hazy, Lasseter elsewhere referred to the parent lamp as the father.<ref name=\" PixarTouch04\"/> Lasseter then realized that he had succeeded in applying the Disney touch of thought and emotion to his characters.<ref name=\" PixarTouch04\"/>\n\n<blockquote>\"''Luxo Jr.'' sent shock waves through the entire industry \u2013 to all corners of computer and traditional animation. At that time, most traditional artists were afraid of the computer. They did not realize that the computer was merely a different tool in the artist's kit but instead perceived it as a type of automation that might endanger their jobs. Luckily, this attitude changed dramatically in the early '80s with the use of personal computers in the home. The release of our ''Luxo Jr.'' [...] reinforced this opinion turnaround within the professional community.\" &ndash; Edwin Catmull, Computer Animation: A Whole New World, 1998.</blockquote>\n\nThe short film was released for home video as part of ''[[Tiny Toy Stories]]'' in 1996, the VHS and DVD releases of ''[[Toy Story 2]]'' in 2000, and ''[[Pixar Short Films Collection, Volume 1]]'' in 2007.\n\nIn 1986, ''Luxo Jr.'' received an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nomination for [[Academy Award for Animated Short Film|Best Animated Short Film]]. It was the first [[computer-generated imagery|CGI]] film nominated for an Academy Award.<ref name=imdb>Internet Movie Database</ref> Spinoffs of the short called \"[[Surprise (1991 film)|Surprise]]\", \"[[Light & Heavy (film)|Light & Heavy]]\", \"Up and Down\", and \"Front and Back\" have appeared on ''[[Sesame Street]]'', which are now available on the ''[[Pixar Short Films Collection, Volume 1|Pixar Short Films Collection \u2013 Volume 1]]''.\n\nLuxo Jr., without the cord, now serves as the [[mascot]] for [[Pixar|Pixar Animation Studios]], appearing in its [[production logo]] before and after every feature film (except for original printings of ''[[Toy Story]]'' (1995), where he only appears after the film; the post-2009 prints featured the Pixar logo at the start of the film before transitioning to the opening scene). He hops in from the right, stops next to the letter \"[[I]]\" in \"PIXAR\". An idea flies into his head. Excited, Luxo Jr. playfully bounces on it until he has completely squashed it down as he did to his rubber ball in the short. He then looks around to check if the letter had been squashed down. As the text \"Animation Studios\" fades in, then angles his head toward the camera, now resembling a lowercase I, which was the idea he had. At this point, all the light typically fades to black except for his head, which goes out with a click after a moment. Occasionally, the head fades in time with the light\u2014this is usually the case when the logo appears right before a Pixar feature film\u2014but this is exceptional. It was designed by Pete Docter and animated by Hi Tech Toons.\n\nSome variations of this sequence were created for specific Pixar films. For ''[[Cars (film)|Cars]]'' (2006), the message \"Celebrating 20 Years\" appeared as the background faded out, with Luxo Jr.'s head used as the zero, using the closing version as the base. Pixar was founded in 1986; ''Cars'', released in 2006, marked its 20th anniversary.\n\nIn the second trailer for ''[[WALL-E]]'' (2008), at the end of the film itself, and on the [[PlayStation 2]], [[PlayStation Portable]] and PC versions of the [[WALL-E (video game)|video game]], Luxo Jr.'s bulb burns out when he turns to look at the camera. WALL-E rolls in from the right, replaces the bulb with an energy-saving fluorescent bulb (in-keeping with the film's environmental themes), and pats Luxo Jr. on the head before going back the way he came. However, he trips over the letter \"R\" in PIXAR as he goes, so he stops and positions his body to take its place, after which Luxo Jr. looks at the camera. WALL-E slightly peeks his eyes out, and the lights go out normally, except for the trailer. The film concludes with the \"BNL\" jingle and logo afterward.\n\nIn 2008, the Pixar logo was remastered and it was animated and produced by [[Gini Cruz Santos]].\n\nA new variant of the sequence, optimized for 3-D projection, was first played with the 3D version of ''[[Up (2009 film)|Up]]'' (2009). The same animation as the regular logo plays as normal. However, the camera pans to the right while zooming out from the \"P\" in the PIXAR letters; therefore Luxo Jr. is seen approaching from the center when he is first seen and is in his usual position near the end. Also, the subtitle (Animation Studios) zooms in as it appears.\n\nAnother anniversary variation was created for the 2011 film ''[[Cars 2]]'' (2011), with the message \"Celebrating 25 Years\" appearing as the background faded out. The C appeared in the same position as Luxo Jr.'s head, which subsequently faded away to leave only the text, again celebrating Pixar's anniversary. This variation appears only in theatrical releases of the [[Cars 2|said film]]. However, in the DVD and Blu-Ray releases and TV airing, the standard logo is seen instead.\n\nOn ''[[Coco (2017 film)|Coco]]'' (2017), the last sound is replaced by a bell tolling, which continues into the film's opening.\n\nIn ''[[Toy Story Toons]]'', Luxo Jr. looks up to the falling curtain, which reveals the title, Woody and Buzz. Both pose as soon as the curtain fell completely.\n\n30th and 35th Anniversary versions were supposed to appear on ''[[Finding Dory]]'' (2016) and ''[[Luca (2021 film)|Luca]]'', but they did not make it into the final films.\n\nYet another variation was used in ''[[Incredibles 2]]'' (2018), where Luxo Jr. is colored in black and the background is reddish-yellow to match the Incredibles logo's colors.\n\nIn 2019, the Pixar logo was reanimated using the [[Presto (animation software)|Presto Animation System]]. The only changes is the base and LED bulb of Luxo Jr., alongside minor color correction.\n\nAnother variation of the logo is also seen after the credits of ''[[Toy Story 4]]'' (2019) where instead of Luxo Jr., Duke Caboom (voiced by [[Keanu Reeves]]) rides in on his motorcycle and bounces the letter \"[[I]]\" down with it and receives a high-five from the Combat Carl Soldier who had missed out on one earlier in the film at which the logo instantly cuts to black (the clap sound substituting for the light clicking off). The start of the movie simply uses the regular sequence. At the end of the regular sequence, it starts to rain. The screen turns dark, with the Luxo Jr.'s light shining through the rain, a la the closing version of the regular sequence, until lightning flashes, transitioning into the opening scene.\n\nAt the end of ''[[Soul (2020 film)|Soul]]'', after Luxo Jr. turns off his bulb, Terry appears. She says \"Oi! Movie's over. Go home!\" and then disappears.\n\nIn ''[[Pixar Popcorn]]'', each short featured a variation of the Pixar logo that focuses on Luxo Jr. doing something in relation with [[popcorn]].\n\n==Other appearances==\n*In 2012, three design students, Adam Ben-Dror, Shanshan Zhou & Joss Doggett created a real life, [[animatronics|animatronic]] version of Luxo Jr. They called the project Pinokio.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://vimeo.com/53476316 | title = Pinokio | date = 1 December 2012 | access-date = 31 March 2013}}</ref>\n\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File: Luxo Jr. sculpture.jpg|thumb|300px|alt=20 feet tall sculpture of Luxo Jr. at the Pixar campus|20 feet tall sculpture of Luxo Jr. at the Pixar campus]] -->\n*Since the short's release, the ball from the short has appeared in almost every Pixar production to date.\n*In 1991, a series of four Luxo Jr. shorts were produced for ''[[Sesame Street]]''.
