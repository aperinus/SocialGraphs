This was [[Ralph Fiennes]]'s film debut.\n\nThis particular film is notable for including the oft-omitted second generation story of the children of Cathy, Hindley and Heathcliff.<ref>{{cite news|last1=French|first1=Philip|title=Wuthering Heights \u2013 review|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/nov/13/wuthering-heights-andrea-arnold-review|access-date=13 October 2017|work=The Observer|date=13 November 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nThe story is that of the fierce passionate love between the moor-loving, wild girl Catherine Earnshaw and the poor equally wild spirit her father takes in to be raised as her brother, Heathcliff. When her father dies, Catherine's biological brother, jealous that Heathcliff was their father's favorite, treats Heathcliff as a servant and has him beaten. The story tracks the story of Healthcliff's and Catherine's fierce love and Heathcliff's rage, pain, jealousy and vengeance that he pitilessly enacts on the man that gets in the way of his marrying her, Edgar Linton. Heathcliff and Catherine's love is painted in intense Romantic tones in contrast to the superficial artifice and shallow feeling of high society as represented by the Lintons. Ultimately Catherine dies and a devastated Heathcliff begs her to haunt him as a ghost. The story then follows how her daughter with Linton, and his son with Linton's sister \u2013 who Heathcliff tricks into marrying him and then treats with great cruelty \u2013 fall in love. Theirs is the happy romantic ending that Heathcliff and Catherine are denied, except after death, walking as ghosts together on the moors.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Ralph Fiennes]] as [[Heathcliff (Wuthering Heights)|Heathcliff]]\n* [[Juliette Binoche]] as [[Catherine Earnshaw]] and [[Catherine Linton]]\n* [[Jeremy Northam]] as [[Hindley Earnshaw]]\n* [[Simon Shepherd]] as [[Edgar Linton]]\n* [[Sophie Ward]] as [[Isabella Linton]]\n* [[Janet McTeer]] as [[Ellen (Nelly) Dean|Nelly Dean]]\n* Jason Riddington as [[Hareton Earnshaw]]\n* [[Simon Ward]] as Mr. Linton\n* [[Jennifer Daniel]] as Mrs. Linton\n* Paul Geoffrey as Mr. Lockwood\n* [[John Woodvine]] as Thomas Earnshaw\n* [[Jonathan Firth]] as Linton Heathcliff\n* [[Sin\u00e9ad O'Connor]] as [[Emily Bront\u00eb]]\n\n==Production==\n[[Paramount Pictures]] was forced to use the author's name in the title of the film as [[Samuel Goldwyn Studio]] (later sold to [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]) owned the rights to the simple title ''Wuthering Heights'' due to the copyright on their [[Wuthering Heights (1939 film)|1939 film version]] of the novel.\n\nThe film stars [[Ralph Fiennes]] as the tortured Heathcliff and [[Juliette Binoche]] as the free-spirited Catherine Earnshaw, in a precursor to their later, successful collaboration on ''[[The English Patient (film)|The English Patient]]''.\n\nThe role of Heathcliff opened up doors for Ralph Fiennes to play [[Amon Goeth]] in ''[[Schindler's List]]''. American director [[Steven Spielberg]] claimed he liked Fiennes for Goeth because of his \"dark sexuality.\"\n\n==Critical response==\nThe film received mostly negative reviews from film critics. [[Rotten Tomatoes]] gives the film a score of 25% based on 12 reviews, with an average rating of 4.20 out of 10.<ref name=\"tomatoes\">{{cite web |title=Wuthering Heights (1992) |url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/wuthering-heights/ |website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |access-date=2021-01-01 }}</ref>\n\n''[[The Independent]]'' wrote favorably of the film, and notes the fidelity of the movie to the dark sensuality and cruel side of Emily Bronte's character Heathcliff:\n\"Ralph Fiennes makes a demonic Heathcliff, his startlingly blue [sic] eyes the only concession to a matinee audience. This performance reminds us that early reviewers of the book were not wrong, when they wondered at the morbidity of its romanticism.\"<ref>{{cite web |date=22 October 2011 |title=FILM / Heights and depths |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/film-heights-and-depths-1557642.html |website=[[The Independent]] }}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|id=0104181|title=Wuthering Heights}}\n\n{{Wuthering Heights}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Emily Bronte's Wuthering Heights}}\n[[Category:1992 films]]\n[[Category:1992 romantic drama films]]\n[[Category:British romantic drama films]]\n[[Category:Films based on Wuthering Heights]]\n[[Category:Romantic period films]]\n[[Category:Films set in Yorkshire]]\n[[Category:Films set in the 19th century]]\n[[Category:Paramount Pictures films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Peter Kosminsky]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Ryuichi Sakamoto]]\n[[Category:Films set in country houses]]\n[[Category:British films about revenge]]\n[[Category:1992 directorial debut films]]\n[[Category:1990s English-language films]]\n[[Category:1990s British films]]"}]}}}}
