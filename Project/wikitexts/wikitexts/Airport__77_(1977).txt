It is directed by [[Jerry Jameson]], produced by [[Jennings Lang]] and [[William Frye (producer)|William Frye]], with a screenplay by Michael Scheff and David Spector.<ref name=\"Airport '77\">{{cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/21845/Airport-77/|title=Airport '77|work=[[Turner Classic Movies]]|access-date=March 1, 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe plot concerns a private [[Boeing 747]] packed with [[Very important person|VIPs]] and priceless art that is hijacked before crashing into the ocean in the [[Bermuda Triangle]], prompting the survivors to undertake a desperate struggle for survival.<ref>{{IMDb title|0075648}}</ref><ref>Leonard Maltin's 2015 Movie Guide {{ISBN|9780451468499}}</ref>\n\nDespite mixed critical reviews, ''Airport '77'' was a box-office hit grossing $91 million worldwide. It was nominated for two [[Academy Awards]].\n\n==Plot==\nWealthy [[Philanthropy|philanthropist]] Philip Stevens is having invited guests flown in his luxurious privately-owned [[Boeing 747]]-100, Stevens's Flight 23, to his [[Palm Beach, Florida]] estate. Aboard are his estranged adult daughter and her young son. Priceless artwork from Stevens's private collection destined for his new museum is also on the jetliner. The collection has motivated a group of thieves led by co-pilot Bob Chambers to [[Aircraft hijacking|hijack the aircraft]].\n\nMid-flight, Captain Don Gallagher is lured from the cockpit and rendered unconscious. A [[Incapacitating agent|sleeping gas]] secretly installed pre-flight is released into the cabin, knocking out unprotected crew and passengers. Chambers, flying to a small deserted island to offload the art treasures, drops the plane below radar range causing Stevens' Flight 23 to \"disappear\" in the [[Bermuda Triangle]]. Descending to virtual wave-top altitude, Flight 23 heads into a fog bank, reducing visibility. Minutes later, a large [[drilling platform|offshore drilling platform]] emerges from the haze, and Flight 23 is headed straight for it.\n\nChambers attempts to avert a collision, but the wing clips the structure's tower, igniting an engine. Chambers extinguishes the fire but a sudden loss of airspeed threatens to stall the airplane. As he struggles to maintain control, the passengers begin waking up to the unfolding disaster. Chambers is unable to maintain his airspeed; the plane stalls and crashes into the water, floating momentarily before quietly slipping below the surface.\n\nThe plane settles in relatively shallow water that is above the plane's crush depth, though water pressure gradually compromises the fuselage. Many passengers are injured, some seriously. Chambers, the only surviving hijacker, reveals the plane is two hundred miles off course, meaning search and rescue efforts will be focused in the wrong area. As a search for the missing plane is launched, veteran aeronautics expert Joe Patroni joins the rescue operation as a technical adviser, joined by the jet's owner, Philip Stevens. Meanwhile, the trapped crew can only contact rescuers by getting a signal buoy to the surface. Captain Gallagher and a professional diver and passenger, Martin Wallace, enter the main cargo preparing to swim to the surface using air masks. The hatch suddenly blows open, killing Wallace. Gallagher barely makes it to the surface and activates the emergency beacon. The signal is detected and a  rescue operation is launched. Meanwhile, the plane's fuselage is steadily leaking.\n\nThe Navy dispatches a sub-recovery ship, the [[USS Cayuga (LST-1186)|USS ''Cayuga'']], the destroyer [[USS Agerholm|USS ''Agerholm'']], and a flotilla of other vessels to the crash site, rescuing Gallagher. Guided by Gallagher, Navy divers rig the plane with balloons and inflate them, slowly raising the aircraft, which could split apart. Just before the plane reaches the surface, a balloon breaks loose and pressure is reduced to stabilize the aircraft. A cargo hold door inside the plane bursts open and seawater swamps the cabin; Chambers, pinned under a sofa, drowns. Emily\u2019s injured friend Dorothy dies from her injuries, Wallace's widow, Karen and a stewardess drown. With time running out, air pressure is increased, raising the plane to the surface. All survivors are quickly evacuated. Captain Gallagher and Stevens's assistant, Eve, get trapped inside and escape through the upper deck. All buoyancy is lost and the 747 slips under the waves for the last time. The survivors are unloaded on a nearby rescue ship.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Jack Lemmon]] as Capt.
