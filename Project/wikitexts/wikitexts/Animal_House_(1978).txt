It stars [[John Belushi]], [[Peter Riegert]], [[Tim Matheson]], [[John Vernon]], [[Verna Bloom]], [[Tom Hulce|Thomas Hulce]], [[Stephen Furst]], and [[Donald Sutherland]]. The film is about a trouble-making fraternity whose members challenge the authority of the dean of the fictional Faber College.\n\nThe film was produced by [[Matty Simmons]] of ''[[National Lampoon (magazine)|National Lampoon]]'' and [[Ivan Reitman]] for [[Universal Pictures]]. It was inspired by stories written by Miller and published in ''National Lampoon''. The stories were based on Ramis' experience in the [[Zeta Beta Tau]] fraternity at [[Washington University in St. Louis]], Miller's [[Alpha Delta Phi]] experiences at [[Dartmouth College]] in [[New Hampshire]], and producer Reitman's at [[McMaster University]] in [[Hamilton, Ontario]].\n\nOf the younger lead actors, only the 28-year-old Belushi was an established star, but even he had not yet appeared in a film, having gained fame as an original cast member of ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', which was in its third season in autumn 1977. Several of the actors who were cast as college students, including Hulce, [[Karen Allen]], and [[Kevin Bacon]], were just beginning their film careers. Matheson, also cast as a student, was already a seasoned actor, having appeared in movies and television since the age of 13.\n\nFilming took place in Oregon from October to December 1977. Following its initial release on July 28, 1978, ''Animal House'' received generally mixed reviews from critics, but ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' and [[Roger Ebert]] proclaimed it one of the year's best. Filmed for only $3 million, it garnered an estimated gross of more than $141 million in the form of theatrical rentals and home video, not including merchandising, making it the highest grossing comedy film of its time.{{r|boxoffice}}{{r|neumer2003}}\n\nThe film, along with 1977's ''[[The Kentucky Fried Movie]]'', also directed by Landis, was largely responsible for defining and launching the [[gross out]] film genre, which became one of Hollywood's staples.<ref name=\"insidestory\"/> In 2001, the United States [[Library of Congress]] deemed ''Animal House'' \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\" and selected it for preservation in the [[National Film Registry]]. It was No. 1 on [[Bravo (U.S. TV network)|Bravo's]] \"100 Funniest Movies\". It was No. 36 on [[American Film Institute|AFI]]'s \"[[AFI's 100 Years... 100 Laughs|100 Years... 100 Laughs]]\" list of the 100 best American comedies. In 2008, ''[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]'' magazine selected it as No. 279 of \"The 500 Greatest Movies of All Time\".\n\n==Plot ==\nIn fall 1962, Faber College freshmen Larry Kroger and Kent Dorfman seek to pledge a fraternity. After they are unable to fit in at the prestigious Omega Theta Pi house's party, Kent suggests they visit the Delta Tau Chi house next door as he is a \"legacy\" and cannot be rejected because his older brother Fred was a member. The slovenly John \"Bluto\" Blutarsky welcomes them and introduces them to other Deltas including Daniel Simpson \"D-Day\" Day, Chapter President Robert Hoover, smooth-talking Eric \"Otter\" Stratton, and Otter's best friend Donald \"Boon\" Schoenstein and girlfriend Katy. Needing their dues, the Deltas invite Kroger and Dorfman to pledge and Bluto, Delta's sergeant-at-arms, gives them their fraternity names (\"Pinto\" and \"Flounder\" respectively).\n\nWanting to remove the Deltas, who are already on probation due to various campus conduct violations and an abysmal academic standing, Dean Vernon Wormer invokes his emergency authority, placing Delta on \"double-secret probation\" and directing pretty boy, smug Omega president Greg Marmalard to find a method to permanently remove Delta. Various incidents further increase the Dean's and the Omegas' animosity toward the Deltas, including the prank-related accidental death of a horse in Wormer's office that belongs to Omega member and [[Reserve Officers' Training Corps|ROTC]] Cadet Commander Douglas C. Neidermeyer, who has been bullying the overweight Flounder, as well as Otter's affair with Marmalard's equally stuck-up girlfriend, Mandy Pepperidge.\n\nBluto and D-Day steal the answers to an upcoming psychology test from the trash, unaware that the Omegas have switched the [[mimeograph]] negative for the exam. The Deltas all fail and their [[Grading in education|grade-point]] averages drop so low that Wormer tells them he needs only one more incident to revoke their charter and have them permanently dismissed from campus. To cheer themselves up, the Deltas organize a [[toga party]] and bring in [[Otis Day and the Knights]] to provide live music; As a fraternity prank, Pinto and Flounder  shoplift at the local supermarket, using Pinto's thick cardigan to steal loads of food, while Otter flirts with Wormer's alcoholic, lecherous wife Marion and invites her to attend the toga party where he has sex with her. Pinto meets Clorette, a pretty cashier at the supermarket and invites her to the party. She ends up passing out drunk and Pinto takes her home in a shopping cart; He later discovers she is the 13-year-old daughter of the corrupt mayor, Carmine DePasto.\n\nOutraged by Marion's sexual escapades and with Mayor DePasto threatening extortion and personal violence, Wormer organizes a [[kangaroo court]] with the Omegas and revokes the Deltas' charter, ordering all of their belongings to be confiscated from their house. To clear their heads, Otter, Boon, Flounder, and Pinto go on a road trip in Fred's [[Lincoln Continental]]. Otter picks up four young women from the [[Emily Dickinson]] College as dates for himself and his fellow Deltas by posing as Frank Lymon, the fianc\u00e9 of college student Fawn Liebowitz, who died in a recent kiln explosion. They stop at a [[Roadhouse (premises)|roadhouse bar]] where The Knights are performing, ignoring its exclusively African-American clientele. A couple of hulking patrons intimidate the Deltas, who flee, abandoning their dates and severely damaging their car.\n\nLater, Boon breaks up with Katy after discovering she has had sex with professor Jennings, while Marmalard and other Omegas lure Otter to a motel and assault him after Mandy's best friend Barbara Sue \"Babs\" Jansen reveals the affair between Mandy and Otter. Due to the Deltas' dismal midterm grade, Wormer ecstatically expels them, having already notified their local [[draft board]]s that they have lost their student deferments and are now eligible for military service. After Bluto, supported by an injured Otter, rallies the despondent Deltas with an impassioned yet historically inaccurate speech, they decide to get revenge on Wormer, the Omegas, and the college at the annual [[Homecoming|homecoming parade]]. D-Day converts Fred's damaged Lincoln into an armored vehicle, which they conceal inside a cake-shaped breakaway float and sneak into the parade. The Deltas then sabotage all aspects of the parade and drive through the viewing stand. As chaos ensues, the futures of several of the characters are revealed: Boon and Katy marry and later divorce, most of the other Deltas become respectable professionals and the Omegas and the other adversaries suffer less fortunate outcomes: Neidermeyer being killed in [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]] [[fragging|by his own troops]], and Marmalard becoming an aide to President Nixon and getting raped in [[Watergate scandal|prison in 1974]].\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[John Belushi]] as John \"Bluto\" Blutarsky\n* [[Tim Matheson]] as Eric \"Otter\" Stratton\n* [[Peter Riegert]] as Donald \"Boon\" Schoenstein\n* [[Tom Hulce]] as Lawrence \"Pinto\" Kroger\n* [[Stephen Furst]] as Kent \"Flounder\" Dorfman\n* [[Bruce McGill]] as Daniel Simpson \"D-Day\" Day\n* [[James Widdoes]] as Robert Hoover\n* [[Karen Allen]] as Katy\n* [[James Daughton]] as Gregory Marmalard\n* [[Mark Metcalf]] as Douglas C.

Many of the magazine's writers were recent college graduates, hence its appeal to students all over the country. [[Doug Kenney]] was a ''Lampoon'' writer and the magazine's first editor-in-chief. He graduated from [[Harvard University]] in 1969 and had a college experience closer to the Omegas in the film (he had been president of the university's elite [[Spee Club (Harvard)|Spee Club]]).<ref name=\"Peterson\"/> Kenney was responsible for the first appearances of three characters that would appear in the film, Larry Kroger, Mandy Pepperidge, and Vernon Wormer. They made their debut in 1973's ''[[National Lampoon 1964 High School Yearbook Parody|National Lampoon's High School Yearbook]]'', a satire of a Middle America 1964 high school yearbook. Kroger's and Pepperidge's characters in the yearbook were effectively the same as their characters in the movie, whereas Vernon Wormer was a P.E. and civics teacher as well as an athletic coach in the yearbook.\n\nHowever, Kenney felt that fellow ''Lampoon'' writer [[Chris Miller (writer)|Chris Miller]] was the magazine's expert on the college experience.<ref name=\"Peterson\"/> Faced with an impending deadline, Miller submitted a chapter from his then-abandoned memoirs entitled ''The Night of the Seven Fires'' about pledging experiences from his fraternity days in Alpha Delta (associated with the national [[Alpha Delta Phi]] during Miller's undergraduate years; the fraternity subsequently disassociated itself from the national organization and is now called Alpha Delta) at [[Dartmouth College]], in [[Hanover, New Hampshire]]. The antics of his fellow fraternities, coupled with experiences like that of a road trip to University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison and its Delta Chi Fraternity, became the inspiration for the Delta Tau Chis of ''Animal House'', and many characters in the film (and their nicknames) were based on Miller's fraternity brothers.<ref name=\"Peterson\"/> Filmmaker [[Ivan Reitman]] had just finished producing [[David Cronenberg]]'s first film, ''[[Shivers (1975 film)|Shivers]]'', and called the magazine's publisher [[Matty Simmons]] about making movies under the ''Lampoon'' banner.<ref name=\"Nashawaty\">{{cite magazine |last=Nashawaty |first=Chris |title=Building ''Animal House'' |magazine=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |date=July 29, 2002 |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,285149,00.html |access-date=December 4, 2021 |archive-date=February 8, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070208133807/http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,285149,00.html |url-status=dead }}</ref> Reitman had put together ''The National Lampoon Show'' in New York City featuring several future ''Saturday Night Live'' cast members, including John Belushi.

Ivy League kind of school\".<ref name=\"insidestory\"/> Kenney was a fan of Miller's fraternity stories and suggested using them as a basis for a movie. Kenney, Miller and Ramis began brainstorming ideas.<ref name=\"Nashawaty\"/> They saw the film's 1962 setting as \"the last innocent year&nbsp;... of America\", and the homecoming parade that ends the film as occurring on November 21, 1963, the day before [[John F. Kennedy assassination|President Kennedy's assassination]].<ref name=\"insidestory\"/> They agreed that Belushi should star in it and Ramis wrote the part of Bluto specifically for the comedian,{{r|neumer2003}} having been friends with him while at Chicago's [[The Second City]].<ref name=\"Schwartz\">{{cite news |last=Schwartz |first=Tony |title=College Humor Comes Back |work=Newsweek |page=88 |date=October 23, 1978}}</ref>\n\nRamis, Miller and Kenney were all new to screenwriting,<ref name=\"insidestory\"/>{{r|neumer2003}} so their film treatment ran to 110 pages, where most treatments average 15 pages. Reitman and Simmons pitched it to every Hollywood studio. Simmons met with [[Ned Tanen]], an executive at Universal Pictures. He was encouraged by younger executives [[Sean Daniel]] and [[Thom Mount]] who were more receptive to the Lampoon type of humor;<ref name=\"Peterson\"/> Mount had discovered the \"Seven Fires\" film treatment as Tanen's assistant while investigating projects left by a fired studio executive.{{r|neumer2003}} Tanen hated the idea. Ramis remembers, \"We went further than I think Universal expected or wanted. I think they were shocked and appalled. Chris' fraternity had virtually been a vomiting cult. And we had a lot of scenes that were almost orgies of vomit&nbsp;... We didn't back off anything\".<ref name=\"Nashawaty\"/> The writers eventually created nine drafts of the screenplay, and the studio gradually became more receptive to the project, especially Mount, who championed it.<ref name=\"Medjuck\">{{cite news |last=Medjuck |first=Joe |title=The Further Adventures of Ivan Reitman |work=Take One |date=July 1978}}</ref> The studio green-lighted the film and set the budget at a modest $3 million.<ref name=\"Peterson\"/> Simmons remembers, \"They just figured, 'Screw it, it's a silly little movie, and we'll make a couple of bucks if we're lucky\u2014let them do whatever they want.'{{-\"}}<ref name=\"Nashawaty\"/>\n\n===Casting===\nInitially, Reitman had wanted to direct but had made only one film, ''[[Cannibal Girls]]'', for $5,000.<ref name=\"Nashawaty\"/> The film's producers approached [[Richard Lester]] and [[Bob Rafelson]] before hiring [[John Landis]], who got the director job based on his work on ''[[Kentucky Fried Movie]]''.<ref name=\"Medjuck\"/> That film's script and continuity supervisor was the girlfriend of Sean Daniel, an assistant to Mount.

Ramis recalled, \"He sort of referred immediately to ''Animal House'' as 'my movie.' We'd been living with it for two years and we hated that\".<ref name=\"Nashawaty\"/> According to Landis, he drew inspiration from classic Hollywood comedies featuring the likes of [[Buster Keaton]], [[Harold Lloyd]], and the [[Marx Brothers]].<ref name=\"Mitchell03\"/>\n\nThe initial cast was to feature [[Chevy Chase]] as Otter, [[Bill Murray]] as Boon, [[Brian Doyle-Murray]] as Hoover, [[Dan Aykroyd]] as D-Day, and [[John Belushi]] as Bluto, but only Belushi was interested. Chase turned the film down in favor of  ''[[Foul Play (1978 film)|Foul Play]]'';<ref name=\"Nashawaty\"/> Landis, who wanted to cast unknown<ref name=\"insidestory\"/> dramatic actors{{r|neumer2003}}<ref name=\"Nashawaty\"/> such as Bacon and Allen (the first film for both) instead of famous comedians,<ref name=\"Nashawaty\"/> takes credit for subtly discouraging Chase by describing the cast as an \"[[Ensemble cast|ensemble]]\".<ref name=\"insidestory\"/> Landis has also stated that he was not interested in directing a \"''Saturday Night Live'' movie\" and that unknowns would be the better choice. The character of D-Day was based on Aykroyd, a motorcycle aficionado. Aykroyd was offered the part, but he was already committed to ''Saturday Night Live''; according to Landis, the show's producer [[Lorne Michaels]] threatened to fire Aykroyd from the show's cast if he took the role of D-Day.<ref name=\"Medjuck\"/> Belushi, who had worked on ''[[The National Lampoon Radio Hour]]'' before ''Saturday Night Live'',<ref name=\"insidestory\"/> was also busy with SNL, but spent Monday through Wednesday making the film and then flew back to New York to do the show on Thursday through Saturday.<ref name=\"Schwartz\"/> Ramis originally wrote the role of Boon for himself, but Landis felt that he looked too old for the part and Peter Riegert was cast instead. Landis offered Ramis a smaller part, but he declined. Landis met with [[Jack Webb]] to play Dean Wormer and [[Kim Novak]] to play his wife; at the time, Webb reportedly turned down the role because of concerns over his clean-cut ''[[Dragnet (franchise)|Dragnet]]'' image, but later said he didn't find the script funny. Ultimately, [[John Vernon]] was cast as Wormer after Landis saw him in ''[[The Outlaw Josey Wales]]''.{{r|neumer2003}}\n\nBelushi initially received only $35,000 for ''Animal House'', but was paid a bonus after the film became a hit.<ref name=\"Schwartz\"/> Landis also met with [[Meat Loaf]] in case Belushi turned down the role of Bluto.

It was never shown theatrically.\n\nIt shows the main ''Animal House'' characters 30 years on, following Landis to cities all over America in search of the former Deltas, Omegas, and Dean Wormer, and describes the various locales and professions the characters have settled into:\n\n* Donald Schoenstein \u2013 Film editor and documentarian, [[New York City]]. Currently in his third marriage to Katy. He has a son named Otis.  Otis's face is badly marked up, reminding viewers of Donald's \"pepperoni pizza\" face alluded to in the original film.\n* Babs Jansen \u2013 Tour guide, [[Universal Studios Hollywood]]. She mentions to Landis that she is organizing an upcoming Faber reunion, and seems to be successful at her job.\n* Marion Wormer \u2013 Seemingly unemployed in [[Chicago]]. She tells Landis of how her husband Vernon accepted the blame for the parade debacle, and was subsequently fired, leading to their divorce. She becomes progressively more tipsy throughout the interview, eventually falling off her chair.\n* Kent Dorfman \u2013 Executive director, Encounter Groups of Cleveland, Inc., [[Cleveland, Ohio]]. He recalls trying to diet during the 1970s with a special program requiring him to shoot up the urine of pregnant women.\n* Robert Hoover \u2013 Assistant [[district attorney]], [[Baltimore, Maryland]]. Hoover recounts how he quit being a public defender after he realized many of his clients were [[insane]]. He also boasts of how his legal advice was sought during the [[O. J. Simpson murder case]].\n* Chip Diller \u2013 Landis receives a letter from Diller, who is currently serving as a [[missionary]] in Africa. He recalls how he was prevented from going to Vietnam as his father was a prime donor to several right-wing political campaigns. When he learned of Doug Neidermeyer's [[fragging]] in [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]], he fell into alcoholism and despair. When he began seeing Jesus in his food, he became a [[Born again (Christianity)|born-again Christian]] and fell into his current profession as minister and missionary.\n* Dean Vernon Wormer \u2013 Wormer is seen at a nursing home in [[Florida]], under the watchful eye of a male nurse. He appears to be [[Dementia|senile]], not recognizing Landis at first (calling him \"Larry\"), and not remembering his tenure as Dean of Faber. When Landis mentions the Deltas, Wormer erupts into a violent, profanity-laced tirade against the boys who cost him his job. He lashes out against the nurse and then physically attacks Landis, consequently knocking out the camera.\n* Eric Stratton \u2013 Gynecologist, [[Beverly Hills, California]]. Otter is depicted as still being the affable, suave gentleman he was in his college days. He remarks that gynecology has been very enjoyable for him and that he has straightened up a bit since leaving Faber. An attractive, blonde patient in her underwear then tells Otter she's ready for her examination. Otter politely ends the interview and goes into the examination room.\n* Daniel Simpson Day \u2013 Landis remarks in a voiceover that D-Day has been the hardest to track down for the documentary, saying that rumors have flown around, with his whereabouts ranging from a [[Buddhist]] monastery in [[Nepal]] to the [[Yukon Territory]]. Landis eventually approaches a house in [[Modesto, California]], where a man opens the door by a crack and claims, in a Hispanic accent, \"I don't know no D-Day person! I don't know him!\" He slams the door in Landis' face and then bursts out of the garage in a car. He pulls out onto the street to the strains of the William Tell Overture, gives a manic laugh exactly like D-Day's, and speeds off.\n* John Blutarsky \u2013 In a final voice-over (since John Belushi was already dead in real life) featuring a shot of the [[White House]], Landis remarks that the viewers all know what happened to Bluto and Mandy Pepperidge: they became the [[President of the United States|President]] and [[First Lady of the United States]]. (After finishing his time in the Army, Bluto married Mandy and became a [[United States Senate|senator]], eventually being elected president.)\n\n== Home media ==\n''Animal House'' was released on [[videodisc]] in 1979.<ref name=\"TimeDisc\">{{cite magazine | title=Disc Duel | magazine=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] | date=February 19, 1979 | url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,912373,00.html | access-date=February 23, 2009 | archive-date=January 27, 2008 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080127080223/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,912373,00.html | url-status=dead }}</ref> It was released on VHS in 1980, 1983, 1988, and 1990.
