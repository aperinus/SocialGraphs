His brother Marko is a [[Police corruption|corrupt police officer]] who envies Milo\u0161's life and is sexually attracted to Marija. Marija is curious about her husband's feelings towards his past and is concerned about the family's income. Lejla, a former co-star, offers Milo\u0161 a starring role in an [[art film]] directed by Vukmir, an independent [[Pornography|pornographer]] who wishes to cast Milo\u0161 for his powerful [[Penile erection|erection]]. Having already caught Petar watching one of his films and not informed of the details of Vukmir's film, Milo\u0161 is hesitant to participate and continue his career but accepts to secure his family's financial future. While meeting Vukmir, Milo\u0161 passes a bald man and his entourage, regarding them warily.\n\t\nThe filming begins at an orphanage, where Vukmir feeds Milo\u0161 instructions through an earpiece given by Vukmir's one-eyed driver Ra\u0161a, while a film crew follows him. Milo\u0161 sees a young girl named Jeca, who is being scolded by her mother for disgracing her deceased [[war hero]] husband's memory by becoming a [[prostitute]]. In a dark room, screens show Jeca eating an [[ice pop]] while Milo\u0161 is given [[fellatio]] by a nurse. Then, Milo\u0161 is instructed to receive it from the mother, while Jeca watches. Milo\u0161 refuses but is forced to continue. Marko later informs him that Vukmir is a former [[psychologist]] who has worked in [[children's television]] and [[Security agency|state security]]. Vukmir meets a hesitant Milo\u0161 afterward to explain his artistic style, showing a film of a woman giving birth to a newborn which is immediately [[child sexual abuse|raped]] by Ra\u0161a, in what the director terms \"newborn porn.\" Milo\u0161 storms out and drives away. At a road junction, he is approached and seduced by Vukmir's female doctor.\n\nA bloodied Milo\u0161 wakes up in his bed sometime later with no memory of what has happened. He returns to the now abandoned set and finds several tapes. Viewing them, Milo\u0161 discovers that he was drugged to induce an aggressive, [[sexual arousal|sexually aroused]], and suggestible state. At Vukmir's manipulative direction, Milo\u0161 beats and rapes Jeca's mother before decapitating her, and later, a [[catatonia|catatonic]] Milo\u0161 is [[sodomize]]d by Vukmir's security. He then watches footage of Lejla voicing concern for Milo\u0161, only to be restrained as her teeth are removed. A masked man then enters the room and forces his penis down her throat to kill her by [[suffocation]]. The footage continues as Milo\u0161 is led to Jeca's home where an elderly woman praises him for killing her mother and offers Jeca as a \"virgin commune.\" Milo\u0161 refuses and escapes through a window to an alleyway, where he watches a girl pass by. He begins masturbating and is attacked by a group of thugs before they are killed by Ra\u0161a, who then takes Milo\u0161 back to a warehouse with Vukmir.\n\nAt the warehouse, Vukmir's doctor administers more drugs after which Milo\u0161 overpowers her, sticking the syringe into her throat. He is then taken into a room to have intercourse with two hidden bodies under a sheet. Milo\u0161 is guided onto one body and the masked man from Lejla's movie enters and begins sexually assaulting the other. Milo\u0161 doesn't notice that his victim is bleeding profusely from the [[rectum]]. Vukmir then reveals the masked man to be Marko, his brother. Marko's victim is revealed to be Marija, while Milo\u0161's is revealed to be Petar, his son. Vukmir's doctor then staggers into the warehouse, clothes disheveled with her vaginal area covered in blood. She is holding a bloodied metal pipe in her hand, implying that she masturbated herself to death after being shot up with the same drug she used on Milo\u0161 to make him sexually aroused and aggressive. She falls and dies from massive vaginal hemorrhaging. With everyone's attention diverted, an enraged Milo\u0161 lunges at Vukmir and smashes his head against the floor, initiating a brawl during which Marija bites Marko in the jugular before bludgeoning him to death with a sculpture. Milo\u0161 wrestles a gun from a guard and shoots all but Ra\u0161a, whom he kills by shoving his erect penis into his empty eye socket. A dying Vukmir praises Milo\u0161's actions as truly worthy of a film.\n\nMilo\u0161, having recalled his actions, including locking his wife and son in their basement before passing out earlier, returns home to find them. He and his wife come to a mutual understanding that he, his wife, and their son should [[Mass suicide|die together]], so the three gather in bed and embrace before Milo\u0161 fires a fatal shot through himself, Petar, and Marija. Sometime later a new film crew, including the bald man from earlier, enters the bedroom. He unzips his [[Fly (clothing)|fly]], as the director advises him to \"[[necrophilia|start with the little one]].\"\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Sr\u0111an Todorovi\u0107]] as Milo\u0161\n* [[Sergej Trifunovi\u0107]] as Vukmir\n* [[Jelena Gavrilovi\u0107]] as Marija\n* [[Slobodan Be\u0161ti\u0107]] as Marko\n* [[Katarina \u017duti\u0107]] as Lejla\n* An\u0111ela Nenadovi\u0107 as Jeca\n* Ana Saki\u0107 as Jeca's mother\n* Lidija Pletl as Jeca's granny\n* [[Lena Bogdanovi\u0107]] as a doctor\n* Luka Mijatovi\u0107 as Petar\n* Nenad Herakovi\u0107 as Keeper #1\n* Carni \u0110eri\u0107 as Keeper #2\n* Marko Crljen as Keeper #3\n* Miodrag Kr\u010dmarik as Ra\u0161a\n* Tanja Divni\u0107 as Kindergarten teacher\n* Natasa Miljus as Pregnant Woman\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Themes==\nSpeaking more than a decade after the film's release, its writer Radivojevi\u0107 discussed the specifics of the material for what would eventually become ''A Serbian Film'' being gathered over a period of ten years, starting in the late 1990s from a [[film school]] screenplay idea of his that the [[University of Arts in Belgrade|Belgrade University of Arts]]' [[Faculty of Dramatic Arts, University of Arts in Belgrade|Faculty of Dramatic Arts]] (FDU) [[dramaturgy]] student initially developed only as far as a synopsis titled ''Orgazmatron''.<ref name=\"Radivojevic-agelast-serbian-film-oct-2022\">{{cite news|last=Nika\u010devi\u0107 Hasci-Jare|first=Galeb|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNxrKCuTrJ4 | archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/vNxrKCuTrJ4 | agency=Agelast podcast|archive-date=4 November 2022|url-status=live|title=Agelast podcast #149: Aleksandar Radivojevi\u0107|date=6 October 2022|access-date=4 November 2022}}</ref> Radivojevi\u0107 further revealed that, when it comes to the general framing of the original screenplay idea, he drew inspiration from the porn star and filmmaker [[Rocco Siffredi]]\u2019s 1990s cinematic exploits: \u201cSiffredi had been cranking out [[VHS]] tapes depicting himself engaged in brutal sexual acts on location with local girls in different parts of Europe (mostly in marginalized and poor [[Post-communism|post-communist]] [[Eastern Europe]]an countries), all of which had an uncomfortable undertone of [[colonialism]]. One particular scene that stayed in my mind has him having sex with a girl in a car while in the background you see this forest out of which a group of grizzled [[beggar]]s suddenly starts to emerge, at which point Siffredi who by now is done with the girl, 'returns her' to the downtrodden locals, handing her over to them in the manner of a modern-day [[Marquis de Sade]] as if to say: \u2018here you go, I\u2019ve finished what I needed do, she's all yours now\u2019. So, by making the main character in that original synopsis an aging male porn star, I began to incorporate this notion of modern-day colonialism via sexual exploitation of a poor country's human resource\".<ref name=\"Radivojevic-agelast-serbian-film-oct-2022\"/>\n\nAfter graduating, Radivojevi\u0107 became friends with fellow budding filmmaker Sr\u0111an Spasojevi\u0107, a film direction graduate from {{ill|\u0423\u043d\u0438\u0432\u0435\u0440\u0437\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0442 \u0411\u0440\u0430\u045b\u0430 \u041a\u0430\u0440\u0438\u045b|sr|lt=Bra\u0107a Kari\u0107 University}}'s Academy of Arts.

On the one hand, you had [[Zdravko \u0160otra]]'s folksy comedies or costumed dramas/sitcoms sucking up so much oxygen, almost to the exclusion of everything else. Meanwhile, on the other hand, and this was most depressing of all, you had this EU arts council funded production using Serbia for EU's political [[agitprop]] agenda of 'promoting tolerance and reconciliation in the post-war Balkans' by boosting sappy local projects of no aesthetic value whose sole reason for receiving EU financing was their respective authors' willingness to amplify the EU-approved message, i.e. to express 'Serb contrition over what happened in the [[Yugoslav Wars]]' via essentially making victim porn, showing small miserable Serb people who are struggling mightily while nevertheless simultaneously 'doing their part in search of collective redemption' by being extremely remorseful. Breaking through that barrier and getting conventional financing in Serbia for the kind of movies we wanted to make was simply impossible\".<ref name=\"Radivojevic-agelast-serbian-film-oct-2022-1\"/>\n\nIn March 2009, six months after the shooting wrapped, film's director Spasojevi\u0107 and writer Radivojevi\u0107 stated that the at-that-point-still-unreleased film is a parody of modern Serbian-made politically correct films that are financed by foreign [[arts council]] funds such as [[Eurimages]]. Commenting the decision to connect the movie to the country via the title, Radivojevi\u0107 replied: \"We have become synonymous with [[wikt:chaos|chaos]] and [[wikt:lunacy|lunacy]]. The title is a [[Cynicism (contemporary)|cynical]] reference to that image. ''A Serbian Film'' is also a metaphor for our [[Cinema of Serbia|[Serbian] national cinema]]\u2014boring, predictable and altogether unintentionally hilarious which to a certain extent is commented on and subtly parodied throughout our film.\" Similarly, Radivojevi\u0107 dismissed Serbian cinema as \"pathetic state-financed films made by people who have no sense or connection to film, but are strongly supported by foreign arts council funds\", while adding: \"the quality of their films is of no concern to them, only the bureaucratic upholding of the rule book on political correctness.\"<ref>Grgi\u0107, Velimir (12 March 2009).

Questioned by the [[Croatia]]n media on whether the violence depicted deals with [[Serbian war crimes in the Yugoslav Wars|crimes committed by Serbian soldiers]] during the [[Yugoslav Wars]], Spasojevi\u0107 answered: \"''A Serbian Film'' does not touch upon war themes, but in a metaphorical way deals with the consequences of [[post-war]] society and a man that is exploited to the extreme in the name of securing the survival of his family.\"<ref>Njegi\u0107, Marko (8 May 2010).

The UK distributor, [[Revolver Entertainment]], initially looked into the possibilities of the process, but it became clear that the film would then have to be resubmitted to the BBFC and further cuts may then have been required. It was decided that to show a heavily edited version was not in the spirit of the festival and consequently its exhibition was pulled from the schedule.

To me that's a metaphor for something unacceptable. The second generation comes back to the country and using the money that had been robbed from the people of Serbia, smears the very same people by portraying them as the worst scum of the earth. You know, when the first generation of the [[Rockefeller family|Rockefellers]] finished [[Robber baron (industrialist)|robbing]] America, the second one built museums, galleries, charitable organizations, and financed America.
