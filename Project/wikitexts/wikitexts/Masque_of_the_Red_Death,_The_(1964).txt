Wright Campbell]], was based upon the [[The Masque of the Red Death|1842 short story of the same name]] by American author [[Edgar Allan Poe]],<ref name=PM/> and incorporates a subplot based on another Poe tale, \"[[Hop-Frog]]\". Another subplot is drawn from ''Torture by Hope'' by [[Auguste Villiers de l'Isle-Adam]].\n\nIt is the seventh of a [[American International Pictures#List of Corman-Poe films|series of eight Corman film adaptations largely based on Edgar Allan Poe's works]] made by [[American International Pictures]].\n\n==Plot==\nOn a mountain in [[Italy in the Middle Ages|medieval Italy]], an old woman meets a red-cloaked figure shuffling [[Tarot card]]s. The figure gives the woman a white rose, which then turns red and dappled with blood.\n\nPrince Prospero, a [[Satanism|Satanist]], visits the village over which he holds dominion, and is angrily confronted by two poor and starving villagers, Gino and Ludovico. Upon discovering the old woman who encountered the red figure, infected with a deadly [[Plague (disease)|plague]] known as the Red Death, Prospero orders the village burned. He abducts Gino and Ludovico, as well as Gino's lover and Ludovico's daughter Francesca, and then sends out invitations to his castle to the local [[nobility]].\n\nAt the castle, Francesca is finely dressed and tutored in etiquette by Prospero's jealous consort, Juliana, and the gathered nobility are entertained by a pair of [[dwarfism|dwarf]] dancers, Esmeralda and [[Hop-Frog|Hop-Toad]]. When Esmeralda accidentally knocks over a goblet of wine, one of Prospero's guests, Alfredo, strikes her. Juliana expresses her wish to Prospero to be initiated into his Satanic [[cult]], and that night Francesca is terrified to discover Juliana and Prospero lying in a [[Hypnotism|hypnotic]] state in Prospero's Black Room.\n\nGino and Ludovico are being held prisoner within Prospero's castle, with the castle guards teaching them armed combat so that they can fight to the death against one another as entertainment for the nobility, which they refuse to do. Juliana performs a ritual in the Black Room, pledging her soul to [[Satan]]. She gives Francesca the key to Ludovico and Gino's cell and tells her to leave. During their escape, Gino and Ludovico fight and kill three guards but are then recaptured by Prospero, who points out to Francesca how her father and Gino have [[sin]]ned.\n\nAt a feast, Prospero summons Gino and Ludovico. He has them each choose daggers to cut themselves with. One of the daggers is coated with poison; when Ludovico attempts to stab Prospero with it, Prospero kills him with his sword. He then casts Gino out of the castle to be killed by the Red Death. In the woods, Gino encounters the red-cloaked figure, who presents him with a Tarot card which he says represents \"Mankind\". In the Black Room, Juliana undergoes her final initiation ceremony, drinking from a chalice and suffering hallucinations of figures who stab at her as she lies on an altar. Awakening from her dream, Juliana proudly declares herself the wife of Satan, but hears Prospero's voice telling her \"There is more\". She wanders out through the different-coloured rooms and is attacked and killed by a falcon. As the nobles gather about her body, Prospero comments that Juliana is now married to Satan.\n\nThe remaining villagers come to Prospero's castle, intending to beg him for sanctuary. Prospero hears the villagers' plea and orders them to go away. When they tell him that unless he helps them they will die, he orders his soldiers to shoot down the villagers with crossbow bolts, deliberately sparing only one small girl.\n\nMeanwhile, Hop-Toad, enraged by Alfredo's striking of Esmeralda, persuades Alfredo to wear an ape costume to Prospero's masked ball, where Prospero has instructed that no one is to wear red. In the guise of the ape's trainer, Hop-Toad humiliates Alfredo in front of the assembled guests by tying him to a lowered chandelier and raising him above the crowd. He soaks Alfredo with brandy and fatally sets him on fire before fleeing. Outside the castle walls, Gino returns to rescue Francesca and again encounters the red-cloaked figure. The figure tells him not to enter the castle and promises that he will send Francesca out to him soon.\n\nDuring the ball, Prospero notices the entry of the mysterious, red-cloaked figure. He and Francesca follow the figure through the coloured rooms into the Black Room, where Prospero believes the figure to be an ambassador of Satan. He asks to see the figure's face, but the figure does not show it. The ball becomes a ''[[danse macabre]]'' as the figure causes all of the nobles to die of the Red Death \u2013 and their corpses dance. Prospero asks for Francesca to be spared and given the same high status in Hell as he believes he himself will receive. The figure sends Francesca outside, and she sadly kisses Prospero before leaving.\n\nThe red-cloaked figure then reveals that he is not a servant of Satan, proclaiming that \"Death has no master\". Prospero rips off the figure's red mask to reveal his own blood-spattered face beneath. The figure is the Red Death personified. Prospero attempts to flee through the now-infected crowd, but his red-cloaked self is always in front of him. The Red Death finally corners Prospero in the Black Room and, after noting that Prospero's soul \"has been dead for a long time\", kills him.\n\nThe Red Death is seen playing with his Tarot cards with the girl who had escaped the massacre of the remaining villagers. Other similarly cloaked figures then gather around him, each wearing a different colour: white, yellow, orange, blue, violet, and black. They discuss among themselves the numbers of people each of them had \"claimed\" that night. When asked of his work, the Red Death notes that only six are left: Francesca, Gino, Hop-Toad, Esmeralda, the little girl, and an old man from a nearby village. The Red Death declares \"Sic transit gloria mundi\" (Latin for \"Thus passes the glory of the world\") and the cloaked figures process into the night. Over the procession are Poe's words: \"And darkness and decay and the Red Death held illimitable dominion over all\".\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Vincent Price]] as Prince Prospero\n**Price also plays the Red Death during the unmasking scene\n* [[Hazel Court]] as Juliana, his mistress\n* [[Jane Asher]] as Francesca, a peasant girl\n* [[David Weston (actor)|David Weston]] as Gino, Francesca's lover\n* [[Nigel Green]] as Ludovico, Francesca's father\n* [[John Westbrook (actor)|John Westbrook]] as The Red Death (in physical form and voice; ''uncredited'') \n* [[Patrick Magee (actor)|Patrick Magee]] as Alfredo\n* [[Paul Whitsun-Jones]] as Scarlatti\n* [[Robert Brown (British actor)|Robert Brown]] as Guard\n* [[David Davies (actor, born 1906)|David Davies]] as Lead villager\n* [[Sarah Brackett]] as Grandmother\n* Skip Martin as Hop-Toad, a dwarf jester\n* Verina Greenlaw as Esmeralda, Hop-Toad's dwarf lover\n\n==Production==\n[[Roger Corman]] later said he always felt \"The Masque of the Red Death\" and \"[[The Fall of the House of Usher]]\" were the two best Poe stories. After the success of ''[[House of Usher (film)|House of Usher]]'' (1960), he strongly considered making ''Masque'' as the follow-up.<ref name=\"cine\">{{cite news|url=http://blog.cinefantastiqueonline.com/wordpress/masque-of-the-red-death-retrospective/ |title=Masque of the Red Death (1964) \u2013 A Retrospective|author=Steve Biodrowski|work=Cinefantastique|date=November 20, 2007|access-date=15 October 2022}}</ref>\n\nIn 1961, Corman announced he would make ''Masque'' from a script by [[Charles Beaumont]] to be produced for his [[Filmgroup]] Company.<ref>{{cite news|title=Zweig's 'Jeremiah' Bought for Film|work=Los Angeles Times|date=Mar 2, 1961|page=C8}}</ref> However, he later said he was reluctant to move forward because it had several elements similar to ''[[The Seventh Seal]]'' (1957), and Corman was worried people would say he was stealing from [[Ingmar Bergman|Bergman]]. \"I kept moving ''The Masque of the Red Death'' back, because of the similarities, but it was really an artificial reason in my mind\", he later said. Eventually, he decided to go ahead and do it anyway.<ref name=\"French\">French, Lawrence \"Interview with Roger Corman\", Introduction to ''The Masque of the Red Death'' novelization, Bear Manor Media 2013</ref>\n\nAnother factor in the delay was that Corman had a great deal of trouble coming up with a screenplay he was happy with. Drafts were written by John Carter, [[Robert Towne]] and [[Barboura Morris]], but Corman was not happy with any of them.<ref name=\"AIP\">Mark McGee, ''Faster and Furiouser: The Revised and Fattened Fable of American International Pictures'', McFarland, 1996 p213-214</ref>\n\nThere were also a number of rival adaptations of ''Masque'' being mooted around this time. The [[Woolner Brothers]] announced a film based on the story<ref>{{Cite news|title='Paris Blues' Blow Hot, Cold on Film: Newman, Woodward, Poitier Provide Tourist's-Eye View|author=Scheuer, Philip K.|date=Oct 6, 1961|work=Los Angeles Times|page=B9}}</ref> as did producer Alex Gordon, who said he had Price as star.<ref>{{Cite news|title=New Novel Has Its Own Music Score: Boylan Scoring 'Gabrielle'; Steve Cochran Executioner|author=Scheuer, Philip K.|date=Oct 11, 1961|work=Los Angeles Times|page=25}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|title=POE SCENARISTS TELL A SAD TALE: Couple Working on 1 of 6 Films Being Adapted From Writer Encounter Pitfalls|author=MURRAY SCHUMACH|date=Aug 21, 1959|work=New York Times|page=12}}</ref>\n \nCorman was pleased with an early draft from Beaumont, which introduced the concept of Prince Prospero being a [[Satanism|Satanist]]. Corman felt this draft still needed work, but Beaumont was too ill to come to England for rewriting. So he hired R. Wright Campbell, who had just made ''[[The Secret Invasion]]'' with Corman, to come with him. Corman says it was Campbell who introduced the subplot of the dwarf, from another Poe story, \"Hop-Frog\".<ref name=\"French\"/>\n\n===Casting===\nCorman cast [[Patrick Magee (actor)|Patrick Magee]], with whom he had previously worked on ''[[The Young Racers]]'' (1963). \"He could find these strange little quirks which he would bring out during his performance, making it a richer and more fully rounded characterization\", recalls Corman.<ref name=\"French\"/>\n\n===Filming===\nAIP had a co-production deal with [[Anglo-Amalgamated]] in England, so Sam Arkoff and James H. Nicholson suggested to Corman that the film be made there. This meant the film could qualify for the [[Eady levy]] and increase the budget; normally, an AIP film was done in three weeks, but ''Masque'' was shot in five weeks. (Although Corman felt that five weeks in England was the equivalent to four weeks in the US because English crews worked slower.)<ref name=\"French\"/> Many of the extensive castle sets were left over from ''[[Becket (1964 film)|Becket]]'', which had been shot earlier that year and had won a [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts|BAFTA]] award for its sets (as well as a nomination for the [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Best Production Design|Best Art Direction]]).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://sensesofcinema.com/2013/cteq/death-has-no-master-roger-corman-and-the-masque-of-the-red-death/ |title=\"Death Has No Master\" \u2013 Roger Corman and The Masque of the Red Death |last=Melville |first=David |date=May 2013 |website=Senses of Cinema |access-date=24 September 2018 |quote=\"...left-over sets from Beckett (Peter Glenville, 1964)\"}}</ref> The film was one of the first films shot in color by cinematographer [[Nicolas Roeg]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/articles/12r1vdWZsKzW28MzWBcrdlZ/nicolas-roeg-its-about-time |title=Nicolas Roeg: It's About Time |author=<!--Not stated--> |publisher=BBC Four |access-date=24 September 2018 |quote=Working at first in black and white, he showed his early flair in the film adaptation of Harold Pinter's The Caretaker (1963) before revealing himself a master of colour in Roger Corman's The Masque of the Red Death (1964)...}}</ref>\n\nDan Haller was used as production designer but not credited to ensure the film qualified as British. Corman says this was why George Willoughby was credited as producer, although it was Corman who was the actual producer.<ref name=\"French\"/>\n\nCorman later expressed dissatisfaction with the final \"masque\" sequence, which he described as \"the greatest flaw\" in the film, feeling he did not have enough time to shoot it. He filmed it in one day, which he said would have been enough time in Hollywood but that English crews were too slow.<ref name=\"French\"/>\n\n==Release==\nWhen the film came out, producer [[Alex Gordon (writer-producer)|Alex Gordon]] sued AIP, claiming the film was based on a script he had written; however, he lost his case in court.<ref name=\"French\"/>\n\nBritish censors removed part of a scene where Hazel Court's character asks the devil to send her a demon. The BBC wrongly claimed in a documentary the removed scene was one where she imagines a series of demonic figures attacking her while she lies on a slab.\n\nThis was proven when journalist Sandy Robertson, using a letter from producer Samuel Z. Arkoff, finally got the BBFC to release their files on the film. The scene where she's attacked by figures while on a slab was in every print seen in the UK, including one Robertson saw as early as the 1960s. British and UK censors required different cuts, which weren't restored until the 2018 restoration by Martin Scorsese's film foundation.\n\nCorman recalled years later:\n\n<blockquote>From the standpoint of nudity, there was nothing. I think she was nude under a diaphanous gown. She played the consummation with the Devil, but it was essentially on her face; it was a pure acting exercise. Hazel fully clothed, all by herself, purely by acting, incurred the wrath of the censor. It was a different age; they probably felt that was showing too much. Today, you could show that on six o\u2019clock television and nobody would worry.<ref name=\"cine\"/></blockquote>\n\n===Reception===\nEugene Archer of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote, \"The film is vulgar, naive and highly amusing, and it is played with gusto by Mr. Price, Hazel Court and Jane Asher ... On its level, it is astonishingly good.\"<ref>{{cite journal |last=Archer |first=Eugene |date=September 17, 1964 |title=Couple of Horrors |journal=[[The New York Times]] |page=52 }}</ref> ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' declared, \"Corman in his direction sets a pace calculated to divert the teenage taste particularly, and past experience with Poe makes him a worthy delineator of this master of the macabre. In Price is the perfect interpreter, too, of the Poe character, and he succeeds in creating an aura of terror.\"<ref>{{cite journal |date=June 24, 1964 |title=Masque of The Red Death |journal=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |page=7 }}</ref> ''[[The Monthly Film Bulletin]]'' wrote, \"Unquestionably Roger Corman's best film to date, ''The Masque of the Red Death'' has passages of such real distinction that one wishes he could be persuaded to take himself more seriously ... Where most films of this nature tend simply to pile on the blood, here there is a genuine chill of intellectual evil, because Vincent Price, initiating horrible tortures with a characteristic air of sadistic glee, also conveys a genuine philosophical curiosity as to the unknown territories into which his quest for evil may lead him.\"<ref>{{cite journal |date=August 1964 |title=The Masque of the Red Death |journal=[[The Monthly Film Bulletin]] |volume=31 |issue=367 |page=117 }}</ref>\n\nThe film was not as successful as other Poe pictures, which Sam Arkoff attributed to it being \"too arty farty\" and not scary enough. Corman later said, \"I think that is a legitimate statement. The fault may have been mine. I was becoming more interested in the Poe films as expressions of the unconscious mind, rather than as pure horror films.\"<ref name=\"French\"/>\nNonetheless, Corman says the film is one of his favourites.<ref>[http://www.cinephile-uk.com/2014/05/director-producer-and-b-movie-king-with.html \"Interview Roger Corman\"], ''Cinephile'',, 9 May 2014, accessed 20 August 2014</ref> [[Andrew Johnston (critic)|Andrew Johnston]], writing in ''[[Time Out New York]]'' concluded: \"Elaborate sets and costumes and Nicolas Roeg's lush technicolor photography make this as close as Corman ever came to real greatness.\"<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Johnston|first=Andrew|date=October 31, 1996|title=Scare Tactics|journal=Time Out New York}}</ref>\n\n==Preservation==\n''The Masque of the Red Death'' was preserved by the [[Academy Film Archive]] in 2019.<ref>{{cite web|title=Preserved Projects|url=https://www.oscars.org/academy-film-archive/preserved-projects|website=Academy Film Archive}}</ref>\nIn 2021 a restoration by [[Martin Scorsese]]'s [[The Film Foundation|film foundation]] was released on blu-ray and dvd.\n\n==Merchandise==\n* [[Dell Comics]] published a [[comic book]] adaptation of the film.<ref>{{gcdb series|id=74207|title=Dell Movie Classic: ''The Masque of the Red Death''}}</ref><ref>{{Comic Book DB|type=issue|id=311676|title=Dell Movie Classic: ''The Masque of the Red Death''}}</ref>\n* A novelization of the film was written in 1964 by [[Elsie Lee]], adapted from the screenplay by Charles Beaumont and R.
