Charles Bovary is kindly and conscientious, but lacks assertiveness and is a dull conversationalist. Following an aristocratic ball she is more dissatisfied than ever and her husband, noticing this, moves to a larger town with potentially greater diversions, where he is befriended by the apothecary.\n\nThere she meets the law clerk L\u00e9on, with whom she can talk about art, literature, poetry and music. His attentions to her cause adverse comment and eventually prompt her to instead become more attentive to her husband and baby, but this leads her to become dissatisfied yet again. The parish priest is a poor listener and does not respond to her unhappiness. L\u00e9on, disappointed by her rejection, leaves to study in Paris, leaving her without congenial company.\n\nAfter encountering her, the womanising landowner Rodolphe decides he would like an affair with her and, under the pretence of offering riding lessons, finds her more than willing. \nAfter four years, she demands that they run away together and, after he agrees, buys travelling clothes and luggage on credit; instead he writes her a farewell letter and leaves town.\n\nShe is in despair, until she discovers that L\u00e9on has found a job in the city of [[Rouen]] nearby. Under the pretence of having piano lessons, she takes the regular coach to Rouen and meets him in a hotel. To pay the cost of the coach fares, the hotel room, smart clothes to go to town and gifts to L\u00e9on, together with extravagant furnishings, she runs up debts with the conniving shopkeeper Lheureux. When he demands repayment, neither of her lovers will help and she cannot face the truth coming out. Bailiffs seize the contents of the house, which is put up for sale by court order, and a lawyer she consults wants sex in return for his help, which she rejects. After taking poison, she dies in prolonged agony. Her husband, devastated when he learns all that has happened, dies of grief. Their child ends up with a penniless aunt, who puts her to work in a factory.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Isabelle Huppert]] as Emma Bovary\n* [[Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Balmer]] as Charles Bovary\n* [[Christophe Malavoy]] as Rodolphe Boulanger, the landowner\n* [[Jean Yanne]] as Homais, the pharmacist\n* [[Lucas Belvaux]] as L\u00e9on Dupuis, the law student\n* [[Christiane Minazzoli]] as the widow Lefran\u00e7ois\n* Jean-Louis Maury as Lheureux, the shopkeeper\n* Florent Gibassier as Hippolyte, the stable lad\n* [[Jean-Claude Bouillaud]] as Rouault, Emma's father\n* Sabeline Campo as F\u00e9licit\u00e9, the maid\n* Marie Mergey as Charles Bovary's mother\n* [[Fran\u00e7ois Maistre]] as Lieuvain, the lawyer\n* [[Thomas Chabrol]] as the Viscount\n* [[Jacques Dynam]] as Father Bournisien\n* [[Henri Attal]] as Ma\u00eetre Hareng, the bailiff\n* [[Dominique Zardi]] as the blind man\n* [[Louis-Do de Lencquesaing]]\n\n==Reception==\nIt was nominated for the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Foreign Language Film]] as well as for the [[Academy Award for Best Costume Design]].
