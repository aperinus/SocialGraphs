Wilson from a screenplay by [[Daniel Farrands]] and Philip Nutman. It is based on [[Jack Ketchum]]'s [[The Girl Next Door (Jack Ketchum novel)|1989 novel of the same name]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.dreadcentral.com/news/38587/new-book-goes-behind-scenes-the-girl-next-door-movie|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100728094418/http://www.dreadcentral.com/news/38587/new-book-goes-behind-scenes-the-girl-next-door-movie |archive-date=28 July 2010 |title=New Book Goes Behind the Scenes of The Girl Next Door Movie}}</ref> which was inspired by the real-life [[murder of Sylvia Likens]], to whom the movie is dedicated.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 2007, a man named David Moran witnesses a man [[hit and run]] by a car in [[New York City]]. He responds to the situation and tries to resuscitate the victim. That evening, he reflects on his past in the summer of 1958, when he meets his first teenage crush, Meg Loughlin. Meg and her disabled sister Susan have lost their parents in a car accident and are now living with their aunt, Ruth Chandler, and her sons, Willie, Ralphie, and Donny.\n\nRuth freely allows her sons' young friends, including David, to her house, where she entertains them and offers them beer and cigarettes. Meanwhile, Ruth starves Meg, subjects her to [[misogynistic]] lectures, and accuses her of being a [[whore]] while her children listen. After an incident when Meg hits Ralphie when he inappropriately touches her, Ruth strips and spanks Susan for being a \"conniver,\" forcing Meg to watch. Ruth then confiscates Meg's ring necklace that had belonged to her mother.\n\nMeg reports the [[Child abuse|abuse]] to a local police officer named Officer Jennings, but law enforcement does not criminally charge Ruth. As punishment, Ruth and her sons bind Meg in the basement and torment her, strip her, and then leave her overnight, hanging by the arms from the rafters. She eventually becomes dehydrated and is unable to even eat the dry toast Ruth tries to feed her. Ruth again spanks Susan's bare bottom as punishment for Meg.\n\nWith Ruth's approval, the neighborhood children visit the Chandler residence to tie, beat, burn and cut Meg for fun. Ruth cauterizes the wounds Meg receives with cigarettes. David tries to tell his parents but is unable to do so. Officer Jennings checks in once more, answering another call about Meg\u2019s abuse, but Ruth and her sons convince Officer Jennings that they were simply roughhousing. While they are distracted speaking to the officer, David loosens Meg's bindings and tells her to escape that night, even offering to leave money for her in the woods. Meg very nearly escapes but is caught when she comes back for Susan.\n\nDavid returns to the Chandler house and is guided to the basement, where Meg is being [[rape]]d by Willie. Donny also wishes to rape Meg, but Ruth refuses because she thinks it would be [[incest]] for him to \"skinny dip in his brother's [[Semen|scum]]\". Ruth then carves a sexually explicit message into Meg's abdomen with a heated bobby pin and burns her clitoris with a [[blowtorch]]. David attempts to leave and get help, but the boys tie him up and kick him in the groin before turning their attention back to Meg.\n\nLater in the day, David awakes still on the basement floor. He frees himself from his bindings and finds Susan sitting with an unconscious Meg. Susan reveals that she had confessed to Meg about Ruth [[child molestation|molesting]] her, making Meg hesitant to escape alone. David plans their escape and lights a fire in the basement. As Ruth enters, David beats her to death with Susan's crutch. Ruth's sons arrive in the basement, and Willie attempts to cut David\u2019s throat with a knife before Officer Jennings intervenes and arrests the Chandler boys. The police take Susan from the basement so that she can testify in court, leaving Meg with David. David returns the ring necklace to Meg, who uses the last of her energy to thank David for what he has done and profess her love for him before finally dying from her injuries.\n\nBack in 2007, the adult David reflects on how his past still haunts him. However, as Meg taught him, \"It's what you do last that counts.\"\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Daniel Manche]] as David Moran\n** [[William Atherton]] as adult David Moran\n* [[Blythe Auffarth]] as Meg Loughlin\n* [[Blanche Baker]] as Ruth Chandler\n* Madeline Taylor as Susan Loughlin\n* Benjamin Ross Kaplan as Donny Chandler\n* [[Graham Patrick Martin]] as Willie Chandler, Jr.\n* [[Austin Williams (actor)|Austin Williams]] as Ralphie Chandler\n* Michael Nardella as Tony\n* [[Kevin Chamberlin]] as Officer Lyle Jennings\n* Dean Faulkenberry as Kenny\n* Gabrielle Howarth as Cheryl Robinson\n* Spenser Leigh as Denise Crocker\n* [[Grant Show]] as Mr. Moran\n* [[Catherine Mary Stewart]] as Mrs. Moran\n* [[Michael Zegen]] as Eddie\n}}\n\nAdditionally, [[Mark Margolis]] portrays the homeless man struck by a vehicle at the beginning of the film and [[Peter Stickles]] portrays an EMT.
