She and her good friend (and director) Nick search for answers and advice about love.\n\nCharlyne asks people on the street, regular folks, her famous (and not) friends like [[Seth Rogen]], [[Demetri Martin]], bikers, romance novelists, kids and even scientists or other 'experts' of love. They each offer diverse views on modern romance, as well as various answers to the age-old question: does true love really exist?\n\nShortly after filming begins, Charlyn has a \"chance meeting\"  with [[Michael Cera]] at a party (a fictionalised verson of himself, a part of the script). He begins to take an interest in her, and they get more comfortable with each other as the camera and director follow them around. As they go across the country, she connects with Michael and they start dating.\n\nA [[docufiction]], there are three actors in this film, [[Jake Johnson|Jake M. Johnson]] is the only one who plays a role (Nicholas Jasenovec, the director of this film). Yi and Cera are fictionalised versions of themselves, and all the rest are \"himself\" or \"herself\". Real couples talk about their own definitions of what love is. Here and there, there are also some stop-motion animation segments, to accompany people\u2019s anectdotes about love.\n\nThere are flat-out documentary segments, exploring love in a wide spectrum. Interviews from around America range from innocent children, to complete theories from scientists. It's like Love 101 for Dummies, with personal interpretations from sharing their most memorable anecdotes.\n\nIn the end credits, there is a touching yet comedic love song performed by Charlyne Yi, and a little stinger to finalize.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:JakeJohnsonCharlyneYiNickJasenovecByPhilKonstantin.jpg|thumb|Jake Johnson, Charlyne Yi, and Nick Jasenovec]]\n* [[Charlyne Yi]] as herself\n* [[Michael Cera]] as himself\n* [[Jake Johnson]] as Nicholas Jasenovec\n;Cameos\n* [[Seth Rogen]]\n* [[Demetri Martin]]\n* [[Martin Starr]]\n* [[Derek Waters]]\n* [[Paul Rust]]\n* [[Paul Scheer]]\n\n==Release==\n''Paper Heart'' received a limited release on August 7, 2009, in the United States and Canada, making $1,286,744.{{citation needed|date=April 2020}} It has been released on home media.\n\n==Reception==\n{{expand section|date=February 2015}}\n''Paper Heart'' received mixed reviews by critics and currently holds a 60% \"Fresh\" rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]].
