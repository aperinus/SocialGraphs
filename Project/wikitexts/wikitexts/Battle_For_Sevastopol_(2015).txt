Smithsonian. Retrieved 14 December 2016.]</ref> The film, a joint [[Russia]]n-[[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] production, was released in both countries on 2 April 2015, and its international premiere took place two weeks later at the [[Beijing International Film Festival]].\n\nThe movie revolves principally around the events of the [[Siege of Odessa (1941)|siege of Odessa]] and the [[Siege of Sevastopol (1941\u201342)|siege of Sevastopol]] of 1941-42.\n\nThe film is directed by Sergey Mokritskiy and stars [[Yulia Peresild]] as Pavlichenko. In addition to Beijing, where Peresild was awarded Best Actress award, the film has also appeared at [[Cannes Film Festival]].<ref>[http://www.screendaily.com/festivals/cannes-news/battle-for-sevastopol-sold-into-asia/5087942.article 'Battle for Sevastopol' sold into Asia]</ref>\n\n== Plot ==\nIn 1937, Lyudmila Pavlichenko is a student who has just passed the entrance exams for [[Kyiv State University]]; to celebrate, she goes to a shooting range with her friends including a female classmate named Masha. In a twist of events, her almost perfect shooting results at the range eventually result in the Red Army contacting her to enter a sharpshooting program. A Jewish doctor named Boris attempts to court her, but she rejects him and leaves to fight on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]] following the German invasion.\n\nEventually Lyudmila is partnered with a grizzled veteran sniper named Makarov, with whom she falls in love. He doesn't return her affections, however, and explains that he lost his family when the Germans invaded. She is also reunited with Masha, who is now a nurse engaged with a young pilot. While defending the city of Odessa, she is injured and Makarov drags her to safety to a local hospital, where Boris has volunteered as a military doctor. After awakening, Lyudmila manages to get Boris to sign her papers so that she can return to the front lines, but finds out that Makarov has died in battle and the Soviets are retreating to Sevastopol.\n\nOnce back on the front, Lyudmila is paired with a male sniper named Leonid. She begins to wound enemy soldiers to watch them suffer, to her new partner's horror. Despite a rough start to the relationship, the two eventually develop a close romance. Masha, now a nurse on the frontline, invites them to her wedding, but then reveals the death of her fiance. This development leads Lyudmila to tell Leonid privately that she wants a son.\n\nWhile on patrol in a field, Leonid steps on a mine that triggers a [[flare]], signalling artillery fire on to the pair's position. Lyudmila again wakes up in a field hospital, where Boris tells her Leonid died in the ambush. Though wounded and exhausted, she is ordered to kill a top enemy sniper for Soviet propaganda. The duel lasts for an entire day; tired of waiting, Lyudmila steps out of cover, exposing herself completely. She is shot, but manages to pinpoint the enemy sniper's location and kill him. As Sevastopol is being evacuated under siege, Boris carries a wounded and traumatized Lyudmila to a submarine that is evacuating the city. While panicked civilians attempt to board, Lyudmila realizes that Boris gave her his own papers to leave the city. A voiceover reveals that Boris, Masha, and countless civilians and soldiers died defending the city from the Germans.\n\nLyudmila's military record makes her a vital propaganda tool for the Soviets, who parade her around the world to collect funds for the fight against fascism. Encouraged by a meeting with the American First Lady, Eleanor Roosevelt, Lyudmila attempts to embrace her femininity by wearing a [[dress]] during a speech in New York. Though the Soviet propaganda minister on tour with her forces her to change back in to a Red Army uniform, she makes a vital impression on the largely male crowd, asking, \"Don't you think, gentlemen, that you have been hiding behind my back for too long?\" After the success of Lyudmila's speech, she is approached by American folk singer [[Woody Guthrie]], who eventually writes a song based on her exploits.\n\nRoosevelt later visits Lyudmila after the war in Moscow during a 1957 trip. The two attend the opera together with Lyudmila's son who is inferred to be Leonid's as well.\n\n== Cast ==\n*[[Yuliya Peresild]] \u2013 [[Lyudmila Pavlichenko]]\n*[[Yevgeny Tsyganov]] \u2013 Leonid Kitsenko\n*[[Oleg Vasilkov]] \u2013 Captain Makarov\n*[[Nikita Tarasov]] \u2013 Boris Chopak\n*[[Joan Blackham]] \u2013 [[Eleanor Roosevelt]]\n*[[Polina Pakhomova]] \u2013 Masha\n*[[Vladimir Lilitsky]] \u2013 Grisha, 1st pilot\n*[[Anatoliy Kot]] \u2013 Nikolai, 2nd pilot\n*[[Natella Abeleva-Taganova]] \u2013 Sonya Chopaka\n*[[Valery Grishko]] \u2013 [[Ivan Yefimovich Petrov]]\n*[[Sergei Barkovsky]] \u2013 [[Filipp Oktyabrsky]]\n*[[Vitaliy Linetskyy]] \u2013 Major, recruit trainer\n*[[Sergei Puskepalis]] \u2013 1st commander\n*[[Gennady Chentsov]] \u2013 commissar\n*[[Svetlana Osadchenko]] \u2013 the reader\n\n== Production ==\nThe filming began in 2012 after the first archive material devoted to Pavlichenko was examined. Serhiy Mokrytskyi, who is better known as a cinematographer, served as director; after his arrival, the plot was altered to more closely match Pavlichenko's life. During production, there was concern of the growing [[Russia-Ukraine relations|political tension between Russia and Ukraine]]. However, the film was successfully released in both countries on the same day, in each country's own respective language.\n\n==Box office==\nThe movie grossed [[Ruble|RUB]] 435,468,256 ($8,702,274) in the Russian box office against a budget of RUB 124,000,000 and hence was a commercial success.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.kinopoisk.ru/film/742026/|title = \u0411\u0438\u0442\u0432\u0430 \u0437\u0430 \u0421\u0435\u0432\u0430\u0441\u0442\u043e\u043f\u043e\u043b\u044c, 2015}}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wikiquote}}\n*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nR7Wdy-3-TA Official trailer] via the official YouTube channel of 20th Century Fox Russia\n\n[[Category:2015 films]]\n[[Category:2015 biographical drama films]]\n[[Category:2015 war drama films]]\n[[Category:Eastern Front of World War II films]]\n[[Category:Biographical films about military personnel]]\n[[Category:Russian biographical drama films]]\n[[Category:Russian war drama films]]\n[[Category:Soviet biographical drama films]]\n[[Category:Films about snipers]]\n[[Category:Films set in Crimea]]\n[[Category:Films set in Odesa]]\n[[Category:Films set in the Soviet Union]]\n[[Category:Films set in Washington, D.C.]]\n[[Category:Films set in 1941]]\n[[Category:Films set in 1942]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Crimea]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Odesa]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Kyiv]]\n[[Category:Cultural depictions of Eleanor Roosevelt]]\n[[Category:Ukrainian war films]]\n[[Category:2015 drama films]]\n[[Category:Russian World War II films]]\n[[Category:Ukrainian World War II films]]\n[[Category:World War II films based on actual events]]"}]}}}}
