At the time, Molly owned a small independent candy store, Upper Sweet Side, that was being bought out by Joel's company, a larger candy corporation called CSR. Joel lived with his girlfriend, Tiffany, until he caught her cheating on him with his coworker Trevor.\n\nOn their way to the same Halloween party, Joel and Molly meet. They initially fight, but end up going on a date, where Joel meets Molly's son from a previous relationship. Joel admits that he is not over his relationship with Tiffany, and Molly leaves angrily. Joel apologizes, and the two begin dating. They break up after a trip to Molly's parents' house, who are revealed to be white supremacists.  Joel begins dating Tiffany again, and Molly begins dating her banker, Eggbert. Molly and Eggbert become engaged, and Joel realizes that he is still in love with Molly, and races to the wedding. He arrives to find that she has already left Eggbert at the altar, and goes to the [[Brooklyn Promenade]] to find her. They agree to get back together, but Molly's ex-husband Spike, who was just released from jail, confronts Joel. Joel wins the fight, and Spike is taken by the police, only to be shot in the head when he tries to escape. Joel and Molly get married, and Joel opens a coffee shop attached to Upper Sweet Side.\n\nIn the present, Joel and Molly reveal that they are getting divorced, as their marriage has since fallen apart due to increasing debts. Because of it Molly got addicted to pills and she started sleeping with Frank again. So, Molly and Joel mutually decided they should be friends. After telling their story to Kyle and Karen, Joel and Molly wonder and then agree giving  their marriage another shot.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n*[[Paul Rudd]] as Joel<ref name=\"variety\"/>\n*[[Amy Poehler]] as Molly<ref name=\"variety\"/>\n*[[Cobie Smulders]] as Tiffany Amber Thigpen<ref name=\"collider\"/>\n*[[Christopher Meloni]] as Roland, Joel's boss<ref name=\"collider\"/>\n*[[Max Greenfield]] as Jake\n*[[Bill Hader]] as Kyle\n*[[Ellie Kemper]] as Karen\n*[[Jason Mantzoukas]] as Bob, Joel's best friend<ref name=\"collider\"/>\n*[[Melanie Lynskey]] as Brenda\n*[[Ed Helms]] as Eggbert Flaps<ref name=\"collider\">{{cite web|last=Bettinger|first=Brendan|title=First Photos of Paul Rudd, Amy Poehler, and Michael Shannon with a Sword on \"They Came Together\" Set|url=http://collider.com/they-came-together-set-photos/|publisher=Collider|date=August 1, 2012|access-date=May 9, 2013}}</ref>\n*[[Noureen DeWulf]] as Melanie\n*[[Michael Ian Black]] as Trevor<ref name=\"collider\"/>\n*[[Michaela Watkins]] as Habermeyer\n*[[Randall Park]] as Martinson\n*[[Teyonah Parris]] as Wanda\n*[[David Wain]] as Keith Flaps\n*[[Jack McBrayer]] as Oliver\n*[[Kenan Thompson]] as Teddy\n*[[Ken Marino]] as Tommy\n*[[Erinn Hayes]] as Valerie\n*Zandy Hartig as Katherine\n*[[Zak Orth]] as Waiter with Pole\n*[[Norah Jones]] as Herself\n*[[Adam Scott (actor)|Adam Scott]] as Sound Engineer\n*[[John Stamos]] as  Assistant Engineer\n*Maureen Mueller as Pam\n*[[Michael Murphy (actor)|Michael Murphy]] as Roger\n*[[Alberto Vazquez (American actor)|Alberto Vazquez]] as Mexican Waiter\n*[[Lynn Cohen]] as Bubby\n*[[Jeffrey Dean Morgan]] as Frank\n*[[Michael Shannon]] as Spike<ref name=\"collider\"/>\n*[[Judith Sheindlin|Judge Judy Sheindlin]] as Herself\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\nThe film was written by David Wain and [[Michael Showalter]].<ref name=\"variety\"/>  Rudd and Poehler participated in a table read of the script at the [[SF Sketchfest]] in January 2012.<ref name=\"variety\"/>\n\n==Release==\nThe film had its world premiere at the [[Sundance Film Festival]] on January 24, 2014.,<ref>{{cite web|last=Nashawaty |first=Chris |url=http://www.ew.com/article/2014/01/25/sundance-2014-paul-rudd-and-amy-poehler-give-rom-coms-an-airplane-twist-in-they-came-together |title=Paul Rudd, Amy Poehler give rom coms an 'Airplane!' twist: Sundance |publisher=EW.com |date=2014-01-25 |access-date=2015-07-27}}</ref> the film went on to screen at  the Sundance London Film Festival on April 26, 2014.,<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.flickeringmyth.com/2014/04/sundance-london-2014-review-came-together-2014.html |title=Sundance London 2014 Review \u2013 They Came Together (2014) |publisher=Flickeringmyth.com |date=2014-04-26 |access-date=2015-07-27}}</ref> and went on to screen at the Chicago Critics Film Festival, [[Seattle International Film Festival]], BAMcinema Fest.,<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://chicagocriticsfilmfestival.com/they-came-together/ |title=They Came Together |publisher=The Chicago Critics Film Festival |date=2014-05-09 |access-date=2015-07-27}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.siff.net/festival-2014/they-came-together |title=They Came Together |publisher=SIFF |date= |access-date=2015-07-27}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Gordon Cox |url=https://variety.com/2014/film/news/n-y-will-get-first-glimpses-of-snowpiercer-they-came-together-at-bamcinemafest-1201173047/ |title=N.Y.
