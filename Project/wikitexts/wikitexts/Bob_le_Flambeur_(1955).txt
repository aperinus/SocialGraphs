A former bank robber and convict, he has mostly kept out of trouble for the past 20 years, and is even friends with a police commissioner, Ledru, whose life he once saved. Ever the gentleman, Bob lets Anne, an attractive young woman who has just lost her job, stay in his apartment in order to keep her from the attentions of Marc, a pimp he hates. Bob declines Anne's advances, instead steering her to his young prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Paolo, who soon sleeps with her.\n\nThrough Jean, an ex-con who is now a croupier at the casino in [[Deauville]], Bob's friend Roger, a safecracker, learns that, by 5:00 in the morning on the day of a big horse race at the nearby track, the casino safe is expected to contain around 800 million [[French franc]]s in cash. As Bob has had a run of bad luck, he plans to rob the safe, convincing a man named McKimmie to finance the preparations and recruiting a team to carry out the heist. Jean gets detailed floor plans of the casino and the specifications of the safe, and buys a bracelet for his wife, Suzanne, with some of the money he is paid for his services.\n\nThe smitten Paolo brags about the upcoming raid to try to impress her. Not taking him seriously, she lets this information slip to Marc just before the two have sex. Earlier, he was arrested by Ledru for beating up one of his prostitutes, but Ledru released him on the condition that he provide some information on a bigger crime; his reaction makes Anne realize she may have made a mistake.\n\nThe next morning, Anne tells Bob what she did, and he and Roger search for Marc, but cannot find him before he is picked up by Ledru. Marc tells Ledru that he has heard about something involving Bob, but needs more time to get the details, so Ledru lets him go. When Paolo hears about Marc and Anne, he finds Marc and shoots the man dead just as he is about to tell Ledru what he was able to find out. While all of this is going on, Suzanne discovers the source of her husband's recent windfall and decides to blackmail Bob for a larger share of the take, but, unable to find him, instead anonymously tips off Ledru.\n\nThinking that, with Marc dead, their plan is still a secret, Bob and his team head to Deauville. Ledru searches fruitlessly for Bob to convince him to abandon his plan before, dispirited, he leads a convoy of armed police to the casino.\n\nBob enters the casino to check on things. The plan is that, unless he signals them otherwise, his team will burst in at 5:00&nbsp;a.m. and rob the safe at gunpoint. He had promised Roger that he would not gamble until after the heist was over, but, after wandering around the tables for a while, he cannot resist placing a bet. Moving from [[roulette]] to [[Baccarat#Chemin de fer|chemin de fer]], he has an incredible run of luck, winning millions, but loses track of the time. Just before 5:00, he finally looks at his watch. He orders the staff to cash his huge pile of chips and hurries out the door. The police arrive as Bob's team are walking toward the casino, and a brief shootout ensues. Bob comes upon the aftermath and holds Paolo as he dies. He and Roger are handcuffed and put into Ledru's car, and two employees of the casino put Bob's winnings in the trunk. Ledru says Bob will probably only spend a few years in prison for planning the robbery, but Roger says that, with a good lawyer, he may get acquitted. Bob, however, quips that he may even be able to claim [[damages]].\n\n==Principal cast==\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Isabelle Corey]] as Anne\n* [[Daniel Cauchy]] as Paolo\n* [[Roger Duchesne]] as Bob Montagn\u00e9\n* [[Guy Decomble]] as Comissioner Ledru\n* Andr\u00e9 Garet as Roger\n* [[G\u00e9rard Buhr]] as Marc\n* [[Claude Cerval]] as Jean\n* Colette Fleury as Suzanne\n* [[Ren\u00e9 Havard]] as Inspector Morin\n* [[Simone Paris]] as Yvonne\n* [[Howard Vernon]] as McKimmie\n{{Div col end}}\n\nThe voice of the narrator is that of [[Jean-Pierre Melville]].\n\n==Production==\nThe film was shot on location in [[Paris]] and [[Deauville]], with two interiors filmed at Melville's own Studios Jenner.{{sfn|Vincendeau|2003|p=229}} According to an interview, the film cost 17.5 million French francs to produce, though a CNC Censorship file includes an estimate of 32 million French francs.{{sfn|Vincendeau|2003|p=229}}\n\n==Release==\nReleased in Paris on 24 April 1956,{{sfn|Vincendeau|2003|p=229}} ''Bob le flambeur'' took in 221,659 admissions in Paris and 716,920 admissions in France as a whole, and was Melville's lowest grossing film at that point in his career.{{sfn|Vincendeau|2003|p=260}}\n\n==Critical reception==\n{{expand section|date=March 2015}}\n[[Vincent Canby]], writing for ''The New York Times'' in 1981, noted that \"Melville's affection for American gangster movies may have never been as engagingly and wittily demonstrated as in ''Bob le Flambeur,'' which was only the director's fourth film, made before he had access to the bigger budgets and the bigger stars ([[Jean-Paul Belmondo]], [[Alain Delon]]) of his later pictures.\"<ref>{{cite news |first = Vincent |last = Canby |author-link = Vincent Canby |title = Bob le Flambeur (1955) Movie Review |url = https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9E00E3D81038F935A1575AC0A967948260 |newspaper = [[The New York Times]] |date = September 26, 1981 |access-date = September 16, 2009 }}</ref>\n\nThe film received positive reviews when it was re-released by [[Rialto Pictures]] in U.S. cinemas in 2001.
