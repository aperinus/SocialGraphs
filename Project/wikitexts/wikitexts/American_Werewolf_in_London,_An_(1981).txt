An international co-production of the United Kingdom and the United States, the film stars [[David Naughton]], [[Jenny Agutter]], [[Griffin Dunne]] and [[John Woodvine]]. The title is a cross between ''[[An American in Paris (film)|An American in Paris]]'' and ''[[Werewolf of London]]''.<ref name=Hallencom/> The film's plot follows two American [[Backpacking (travel)|backpackers]], David and Jack, who are attacked by a [[werewolf]] while travelling in England, causing David to question whether he will become a werewolf under the next [[full moon]].<ref name=star>[https://www.thestar.com/entertainment/movies/2016/06/26/rewind-an-american-werewolf-in-london-still-howlingly-good.html \"Rewind: An American Werewolf in London still howlingly good\"].

Prospective financiers believed that Landis' script was too frightening to be a [[comedy film]] and too humorous to be a [[horror film]]. After achieving success in Hollywood with the comedies ''[[The Kentucky Fried Movie]]'', ''[[Animal House|National Lampoon's Animal House]]'' and ''[[The Blues Brothers (film)|The Blues Brothers]]'', Landis was able to secure financing from [[PolyGram Pictures]] to produce ''An American Werewolf in London''.\n\n''An American Werewolf in London'' was released in the US by [[Universal Pictures]] on August 21, 1981. It was a critical and commercial success, winning the 1981 [[Saturn Award]] for [[Saturn Award for Best Horror Film|Best Horror Film]] and the first ever [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Best Makeup and Hairstyling|Best Makeup]]. Since its release, it has become a [[cult classic]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Berardinelli|first=James|url=https://preview.reelviews.net/movies/a/american_london.html|title=''An American Werewolf in London'' review|work=Reelviews|year=2000|access-date=July 26, 2009}}</ref> A sequel, ''[[An American Werewolf in Paris]]'', was released by [[Hollywood Pictures]] in 1997.\n\n== Plot ==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be set between 400 to 700 words only. -->\nTwo American [[backpacking (travel)|backpackers]] from [[New York City]], David Kessler and Jack Goodman, are trekking across the [[North York Moors|moors in Yorkshire]]. As night falls, they stop at a local pub called the Slaughtered Lamb. Jack notices a [[pentagram|five-pointed star]] on the wall, but when he asks about it, the pub-goers become hostile. The pair decide to leave, and the pub-goers warn them to keep to the road, stay clear of the moors and beware of the full moon. David and Jack wander off the road onto the moors, and are attacked by an unseen, vicious creature. Jack is mauled to death and David is injured. The beast is shot and killed by some of the pub-goers, who came out searching for the boys. Instead of a dead animal, David sees the corpse of a naked man lying next to him before passing out.\n\nDavid wakes up three weeks later in a hospital in [[London]]. He is interviewed by police Inspector Villiers, who tells him that he and Jack were attacked by an escaped lunatic, but David insists they were attacked by some sort of rabid dog or wolf. An undead Jack appears to David and explains the beast that attacked them was a [[werewolf]], and reveals that David is now one. Jack urges David to [[Suicide|kill himself]] before the next full moon, not only because Jack is cursed to linger undead for as long as the bloodline of the werewolf that attacked them survives, but also to prevent David from inflicting the same fate on anyone else.\n\nDr. Hirsch takes a road trip to the Slaughtered Lamb to see if what David has told him is true. When asked about the incident, the pub-goers deny any knowledge of David, Jack, or the attack. However, one distraught pub-goer speaks to Dr. Hirsch outside the pub and says David should not have been taken away, and that everyone else will be in danger when he transforms.\n\nUpon his release from hospital, David moves in with Alex Price, a pretty young nurse who grew fond of him in the hospital. He stays in Alex's London flat, where they later have sex for the first time. Jack, in a more advanced stage of decay, confronts David to warn him that he will become a werewolf the next night. Jack again advises David to kill himself to avoid killing innocent people, but David refuses to believe him. When the full moon rises, David transforms from his human form into a werewolf. He prowls the streets and the [[London Underground]], killing six people. He wakes up the next morning naked on the floor of a wolf enclosure at the [[London Zoo]], with no recollection of what happened, and makes his way back to Alex's flat.\n\nAfter realizing that he became a werewolf and was responsible for the previous night's murders, David unsuccessfully attempts to get himself arrested in [[Trafalgar Square]]. He goes to [[Piccadilly Circus]], calling his family from a phone booth to say he loves them, then loses courage when he attempts and fails to slice his own wrists with a pocket knife. David sees Jack, in a yet more advanced stage of decay, outside of an [[adult movie theatre]]. Inside, Jack is accompanied by David's victims from the previous night, some of whom are furious with David and suggest different [[Suicide methods|methods]] for him to commit suicide.\n\nDavid transforms into a werewolf again inside the cinema. He decapitates Inspector Villiers, and wreaks havoc in the streets, causing the deaths of many drivers and bystanders. He is ultimately trapped and surrounded in an alleyway by the police. Alex runs down the alley and attempts to calm David by telling him that she loves him. Although David's consciousness appears to recognize her for a moment, he lunges forward and is shot by the police. Alex cries while staring at David, reverted to human form, lying dead and naked on the ground.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[David Naughton]] as David Kessler\n* [[Jenny Agutter]] as Nurse Alex Price\n* [[Griffin Dunne]] as Jack Goodman\n* [[John Woodvine]] as Dr. J.

He and a Yugoslav member of the crew were driving in the back of a car on location when they came across a group of [[Romani people]]. The Romani people appeared to be performing rituals on a man being buried so that he would not \"rise from the grave.\" This made Landis realize he would never be able to confront the undead and gave him the idea for a film in which a man would go through the same thing.<ref>''An Interview with John Landis'' featurette on the ''American Werewolf in London'' [[DVD]]</ref>\n\nLandis wrote the first draft of ''An American Werewolf in London'' in 1969 and shelved it for over a decade. Two years later, Landis wrote, directed, and starred in his debut film, ''[[Schlock (film)|Schlock]]'', which developed a cult following. Landis developed box-office status in Hollywood through the successful [[comedy film]]s ''[[The Kentucky Fried Movie]]'', ''[[National Lampoon's Animal House]]'' and ''[[The Blues Brothers (film)|The Blues Brothers]]'' before securing $10 million financing from [[PolyGram Pictures]] for his werewolf film.

Hallenbeck lambasted the film's inconsistent tone, juvenile humor, poor direction, and emphasis on shock value to the detriment of continuity and plot. He cited Rick Baker's makeup effects and Jenny Agutter's performance as genuinely powerful, but concluded that \"thanks to the director's insincerity, slapdash approach and what appears to be a thinly veiled contempt for the material, [''An American Werewolf in London''] succeeds neither as comedy nor as horror.\"<ref name=Hallencom>{{cite book |title=Comedy-Horror Films: A Chronological History, 1914-2008 |url=https://archive.org/details/comedyhorrorfilm00hall|url-access=limited |last=Hallenbeck |first=Bruce G.|publisher=[[McFarland & Company]]|year=2009 |isbn=9780786453788|pages=119\u2013123}}</ref>\n\n=== Accolades ===\nAt the [[54th Academy Awards]], ''An American Werewolf in London'' won the first-ever Academy Award for [[Academy Award for Best Makeup and Hairstyling|Best Makeup]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2020}} During the 1982 Saturn Awards, the film won for [[Saturn Award for Best Horror Film|Best Horror Film]] and [[Saturn Award for Best Make-up|Best Makeup]] and nominated for [[Saturn Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]] and [[Saturn Award for Best Writing|Best Writing]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2020}}\n\nA 2008 [[Empire (film magazine)|''Empire'' magazine]] poll of critics and readers named ''An American Werewolf in London'' as the 107th-greatest film of all time.<ref>{{cite web |title=The 500 Greatest Movies Of All Time |url=https://www.empireonline.com/movies/features/500-greatest-movies/ |website=[[Empire (film magazine)]] |date=3 October 2008}}</ref>\n\n== Legacy ==\n=== Media recognition ===\n''An American Werewolf in London'' is chiefly appreciated as a milestone in the comedy-horror genre and for its innovative makeup effects.
