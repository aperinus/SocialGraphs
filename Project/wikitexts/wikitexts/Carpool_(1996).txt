The film was theatrically released with ''[[Superior Duck]]'' as the preceding cartoon.\n\nAs of March 20, 2019, the film rights to ''Carpool'' are owned by the [[Walt Disney Studios (division)|Walt Disney Studios]] through [[20th Century Fox]], which had obtained the film rights from [[Warner Bros.]] in the mid-2010s.\n\n==Plot==\nWorkaholic Daniel Miller is forced to drive their family carpool when Diane Miller becomes ill. Daniel is in the middle of a huge advertising campaign for Hammerman's, a large chain of delis, and initially refuses the carpool until Mrs. Miller guilts him. It includes two sons, Andrew and Bucky, two local ladies; Chelsea and her older sister, Kayla, and local weirdo Travis. Meanwhile, Franklin Laszlo is the owner of a failing carnival. Franklin has the bright idea to rob a bank in order to get the money to keep his business going. As Franklin leaves to attempt his bank robbery, he enters a local Hammerman's where Daniel is also at. Two gunmen: Neil and Jerry, who also co-incidentally plan to rob the deli, hold it up and eventually a standoff ensues between them, an older woman, Franklin, and a local detective, Lt. Erdman. Through a series of misunderstandings, Franklin takes Daniel as the hostage and has Hammerman's money that the gunmen had stolen from the deli. Heading to the van, Franklin kidnaps Daniel and the children. The group bonds through a series of misadventures; stopping at a hair salon to use the restroom, evading the police using a disguise, and eventually being chased by an obsessed meter maid, Martha. Franklin reveals to the group the reason behind his robbery and kidnapping: keeping the carnival open so he can see his son.\n\nEventually, Franklin takes the group to his carnival, where the children enjoy the rides. The gunmen, Neil & Jerry have tracked Franklin through his wallet, which he had dropped in the deli, and want Hammerman's money. A fight ensues, with the controls to the [[Ferris wheel|Ferris Wheel]] being damaged. Daniel uses his advertising materials to jam the mechanism of the ride and climbs up to rescue Andrew. Franklin ties up the gunmen Neil and Jerry, locks them into the [[Zipper (ride)|Zipper]] and gets his wallet back. Daniel realizes it's too late to attend his pitch meeting, but Franklin convinces him otherwise. Daniel arrives late and unprepared but successfully pitches to Mr. Hammerman that children don't like his chain and that a revamp to something more kid-friendly would help. Franklin likes the idea and Daniel gains the backbone to tell him he quit. Eventually the police arrive but Daniel does not wish to press charges and Franklin is let off the hook.\n\nSometime later, Franklin and Daniel are co-owners of the carnival, with Mr. Hammerman supplying them with food. Everything seems to be okay, until Franklin realizes he missed a lunch date with his mother, who is shown destroying a local [[Sizzler]] over the closing credits.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Tom Arnold (actor)|Tom Arnold]] as Franklin Laszlo\n* [[David Paymer]] as Daniel Miller\n* [[Rhea Perlman]] as Martha\n* [[Rod Steiger]] as Mr. Hammerman\n* [[Kim Coates]] as Lt.
