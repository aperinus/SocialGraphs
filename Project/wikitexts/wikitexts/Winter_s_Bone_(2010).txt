It was adapted by Granik and [[Anne Rosellini]] from the 2006 novel of the same name by [[Daniel Woodrell]]. The film stars [[Jennifer Lawrence]] as a poverty-stricken teenage girl named Ree Dolly in the rural [[Ozarks]] of [[Missouri]] who, to protect her family from eviction, must locate her missing father. The film explores the interrelated themes of close and distant family ties, the power and speed of gossip, self-sufficiency, poverty, and patriarchy as they are influenced by the pervasive underworld of illegal [[meth lab]]s.\n\nThe film won [[List of accolades received by Winter's Bone|several awards]], including the [[List of Sundance Film Festival award winners#2010|Grand Jury Prize: Dramatic Film]] at the [[2010 Sundance Film Festival]]. It also received four [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] nominations at the [[83rd Academy Awards]]: [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Adapted Screenplay]], [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress in a Leading Role]] for 20-year-old Lawrence (the [[List of oldest and youngest Academy Award winners and nominees#Youngest nominees 3|second-youngest]] Best Actress nominee at the time) and [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Supporting Actor]] for [[John Hawkes (actor)|John Hawkes]]. In addition, Lawrence was nominated for [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Motion Picture \u2013 Drama|Best Actress \u2013 Motion Picture Drama]] and [[Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Leading Role|Outstanding Leading Actress]] at the [[68th Golden Globe Awards]] and [[17th Screen Actors Guild Awards]], respectively.\n\n==Plot==\nIn the rural [[Ozarks]] of [[Missouri]], seventeen-year-old Ree Dolly looks after her mentally ill mother, Connie, twelve-year-old brother Sonny, and six-year-old sister Ashlee. She makes sure her siblings eat and teaches them survival skills such as hunting and cooking. The family is destitute. Ree's father, Jessup, has not been home for a long time; his whereabouts are unknown. He is out on bail following an arrest for manufacturing [[Methamphetamine|meth]].\n\nSheriff Baskin tells Ree that if her father does not appear for his court date, they will lose the house because it was put up as part of his [[Bail bond|bond]]. Ree sets out to find her father. She starts with her meth-addicted uncle Teardrop and continues to more distant kin, eventually trying to talk to the local [[crime boss]], Thump Milton. Milton refuses to see her; the only information Ree comes up with are warnings to leave the situation alone and stories that Jessup died in a meth lab fire or skipped town to avoid the trial.\n\nWhen Jessup fails to appear for the trial, the [[Bail bondsman|bondsman]] comes looking for him and tells Ree that she has about a week before the house and land are seized. Ree tells him that Jessup must be dead, because \"Dollys don't run\". He tells her that she must provide proof that her father is dead to avoid the bond being forfeited.\n\nRee tries to go see Milton again and is severely beaten by the women of his family. Teardrop rescues Ree, promising her attackers that she will not cause more trouble. Teardrop tells Ree that her father was killed because he was going to inform on other meth cookers, but he does not know who killed him. He warns her that if she finds out who did, she must not tell him. Later, Ree talks to an [[United States Army|Army]] recruiter about enlisting for the $40,000 bonus, but he tells her that she needs her parents' signatures to enlist, and that she has the wrong reasons. On the way home from a bar, Ree and her uncle are stopped by the sheriff, who wants to question Teardrop. After a tense standoff, where Teardrop implies that he knows the Sheriff leaked that Jessup was an informer, Teardrop drives off.\n\nA few nights later, the Milton women who beat Ree come to her house and offer to take her to \"[her] daddy's bones\". The women place a sack on her head and drive her to a pond, where they row to the shallow area where her father's submerged body lies. They tell Ree to reach into the water and grasp her father's hands so they can cut them off with a chainsaw; the severed hands will serve as proof of death for the authorities. Ree takes the hands to the sheriff, telling him that someone flung them onto the porch of her house.\n\nThe bondsman gives Ree the cash portion of the bond, which was put up by an anonymous associate of Jessup. Ree tries to give Jessup's banjo to Teardrop, but he tells her to keep it at the house for him. As he is leaving, he tells her that he now knows who killed her father. Ree reassures Sonny and Ashlee that she will never leave them. As the three sit on the porch, Ashlee begins to play the banjo.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Jennifer Lawrence]] as Ree Dolly, a 17-year-old girl in the Ozark Mountains\n* Isaiah Stone as Sonny Dolly, Ree's younger brother\n* Ashlee Thompson as Ashlee Dolly, Ree's younger sister\n* Valerie Richards as Connie Dolly, Ree's mentally ill mother\n* [[John Hawkes (actor)|John Hawkes]] as \"Teardrop\" Dolly, Ree's uncle and a methamphetamine addict\n* Cinnamon Schultz as Victoria, Teardrop's girlfriend\n* [[Garret Dillahunt]] as Sheriff Baskin\n* Lauren Sweetser as Gail Lockrum, Ree's friend who left school to have a baby\n* Cody Shiloh Brown as Floyd Langan, Gail's husband\n* Shelley Waggener as Sonya, a neighbor who takes care of Ree's horse\n* William White as \"Blond\" Milton, Sonya's husband and a methamphetamine addict\n* Casey MacLaren as Megan, Ree's distant cousin\n* Kevin Breznahan as Arthur \"Little Arthur\", Megan's husband and a member of the methamphetamine gang\n* Ronnie Hall as \"Thump\" Milton, leader of the methamphetamine gang\n* [[Dale Dickey]] as Merab, Thump Milton's wife\n* Beth Domann as Alice, Merab's sister\n* Charlotte Jeane Lucas as Tilly, Merab's sister\n* [[Tate Taylor]] as Mike Satterfield, the bondsman\n* [[Sheryl Lee]] as April, Jessup's ex-girlfriend \n* Marideth Sisco as April's mother\n* Russell Schalk as Sergeant Schalk, an Army recruiter \n}}\n\n==Reception==\n{{Anchor|Response|Critics}}\n[[File:Jennifer Lawrence at the 83rd Academy Awards crop.jpg|thumb|upright|Jennifer Lawrence's performance was universally lauded and the 20-year-old garnered her first nomination for an [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Academy Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role]], becoming the [[List of oldest and youngest Academy Award winners and nominees#Youngest nominees 3|second-youngest Best Actress]] nominee at the time.]]\n\n===Critical response===\n''Winter's Bone'' received critical acclaim, with Jennifer Lawrence's performance being universally lauded.
