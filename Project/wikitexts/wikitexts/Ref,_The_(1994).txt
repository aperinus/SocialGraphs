Caroline has had an affair, and Lloyd is miserable and blames the behavioral problems of their 15-year-old son Jesse on his wife's coddling of him. Caroline calls out Lloyd for his inability to stand up to his domineering mother, Rose. \n\nIn the same town, [[Burglary|cat burglar]] Gus is in the midst of stealing jewelry from a home he has broken into. However, his plan goes awry when he accidentally sets off the alarm and is chased out by a guard dog. His getaway car, driven by his bumbling partner Murray, is no longer there. At a convenience store, he runs into Lloyd and Caroline and decides to take them hostage, ordering the couple to drive him to their house. Along the way, Caroline and Lloyd continue to argue, with Gus having to repeatedly intercede and telling them to shut up.\n\nAt the Chasseur house, Gus has Lloyd and Caroline tied up as he figures out a way to flee town with Murray. Lloyd and Caroline continue to bicker. Knowing that Murray usually seeks refuge at seedy bars, Gus calls the local bar and manages to get in touch with him. He instructs Murray to steal a boat for their getaway. The local police set up roadblocks and impose a curfew to look for Gus, while two inept officers go door-to-door. Lt. Huff, the police chief, is less than concerned because the town rarely sees criminal activity like this. \n\nJesse, who has been away at a military school, arrives home earlier than his parents expect. Unbeknownst to his parents, Jesse has been blackmailing the school's commanding officer, Siskel, with photographs of an affair, and is stashing the money with plans of running away. Gus has Jesse tied up along with his parents. Jesse, unhappy with his home life, pleads to join Gus into a life of crime, but Gus calls Jesse out on his naivety and tells the boy he should appreciate his comfortable upbringing.\n\nAs the police search for Gus expands, he is forced to continue hiding out in the Chasseur home while he waits on Murray. Complicating matters are visiting neighbors, such as George, who is dressed up as [[Santa Claus]] and arrives to deliver a fruitcake for the family. Later, Lloyd's family\u2014his brother Gary, sister-in-law Connie, their two children Mary and John, and mother Rose\u2014arrive to celebrate Christmas Eve. Rose is extremely wealthy and bullies everyone in the family. To hide any suspicion that Lloyd and Caroline are being held hostage, Gus pretends to be the couple's marriage counselor, Dr. Wong, and tells Lloyd's family his presence is needed as part of \"experimental therapy\". Jesse is tied up and gagged upstairs in his parents' closet. During the family dinner, Caroline and Lloyd are unable to stop fighting, and Caroline demands a divorce. Gus' pointed comments goad Lloyd to stand up to his wife and his mother. Everyone finds out who Gus really is after Rose attempts to go upstairs; Gus puts a gun to her head, and Connie, fed up with her mother-in-law, says, \"Shoot her.\"\n\nSiskel turns up at the door and reveals how he is being blackmailed. Jesse has managed to untie himself and his parents discover his hidden money. George, still dressed as Santa, but now very drunk, returns to the home, protesting why he never gets a gift in return. He spots the gun and realizes who Gus is but gets knocked out. The state police arrive, and Lloyd, having a change of heart, decides he cannot \"spend [his] life sending everyone [he] care[s] about to prison\", and instructs Jesse to take Gus to the docks using a path through the woods. Gus, in George's Santa suit, makes it safely to a boat where Murray awaits. The men escape, arguing in much the same manner he argued all night with Caroline and Lloyd. \n\nBack at home, the couple's bickering even drives away the police. Having aired out their differences throughout the evening with their armed robber's assistance, they make up and decide to stay together. Their reconciliation is interrupted when John informs them that \"grandma Rose is eating through her gag.\"\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Denis Leary]] as Gus\n* [[Judy Davis]] as Caroline Chasseur\n* [[Kevin Spacey]] as Lloyd Chasseur\n* [[Robert J.
