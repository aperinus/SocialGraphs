The screenplay by [[Kurt Wimmer]] and [[Mark Bomback]] was based on the [[Total Recall (1990 film)|1990 film of the same name]], which was inspired by the 1966 short story \"[[We Can Remember It for You Wholesale]]\" by [[Philip K. Dick]]. The supporting cast features [[Bryan Cranston]], [[Bokeem Woodbine]], [[John Cho]], and [[Bill Nighy]]. Unlike the first film, the setting is on a [[dystopian]] Earth, not Mars.<ref name=\"MTV\">{{cite web |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1683538/total-recall-len-wiseman.jhtml |title=Total Recall remake heads in 'a different direction' from original |work=MTV |date=April 20, 2012 |access-date=April 27, 2012 |last=Warner |first=Kara}}</ref> The film blends American and Asian influences, notably in the settings and dominant populations of the two nation-states in the story: the United Federation of Britain (Western Europe) and the Colony (Australia).\n\nThe film was first announced in 2009<ref name=\"Announcement\">{{cite web |url=https://www.comingsoon.net/news/movienews.php?id=53284 |title=A Total Recall Remake is Very Real |work=ComingSoon |date=February 26, 2009 |access-date=May 27, 2011}}</ref> and was released in North America on August 3, 2012, grossing over $198 million worldwide.<ref name=\"boxofficemojo.com\">{{cite web |url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?page=main&id=totalrecall2012.htm|title= Total Recall (2012) Total Lifetime Grosses|access-date=2012-10-16}}</ref><ref name=\"Release\">{{cite news |url=https://www.slashfilm.com/sony-schedules-total-recall-august-2012-dates-i-hate-dad-kevin-james-mma-film |title=Sony Schedules 'Total Recall' For August 2012, Also Dates 'I Hate You, Dad' And Kevin James' MMA Film |last=Fischer |first=Russ |work=/Film |date=February 25, 2011 |access-date=June 6, 2011}}</ref>  The film received mixed reviews, with the [[Rotten Tomatoes]] critical consensus praising the action sequences but saying that it lacks the elements of the original film that made it a classic.<ref name=\"RottenTomatoes\"/>\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:Filmplot, a plot section should not exceed 700 words. Please do not add excessive details. --> <!--The plot is for the theatrical version-->\nAt the end of the 21st century, [[chemical warfare]] has devastated the Earth. The only habitable land left consists of two territories: the United Federation of Britain (UFB), located on the [[British Isles]] and northwestern Europe; and the Colony, spanning all of [[Australia]]. Factory workers from the Colony commute to the UFB each day via \"The Fall\", a [[Gravity train|gravity elevator]] running through the Earth's core. The disparity in living conditions has resulted in a group of people called the Resistance, deemed terrorists by the UFB, who seek to improve living conditions in the Colony.\n\nColony worker Douglas Quaid has been having unsettling dreams of being a secret agent partnered with an unnamed woman. Tired of his factory job building police robots with his friend Harry, he visits Rekall, a company that implants artificial memories. He decides on the fantasy of being a secret agent. During exploratory preparations by technician McClane, they discover that Quaid already has real memories of being a spy. As McClane starts to question Quaid about the memories, a squad of UFB police arrive, killing the Rekall staff in an attempt to arrest Quaid. Strange instincts kick in as Quaid defends himself, killing the entire squad. Upon returning home, Quaid relays the incident to his wife Lori, who attempts to kill him, revealing that she is a UFB intelligence agent and they have only been married for six weeks, not seven years as he believed. After Quaid escapes, he receives a phone call from Charles Hammond, a former colleague of his who directs him to a safe-deposit box. Inside it, Quaid finds a message from himself with the address of a UFB apartment.\n\nUpon arriving at the UFB, Quaid is pursued by Lori and her team, but is rescued by Melina, the woman from his dreams. Recuperating at the apartment, Quaid finds another hidden recording, revealing his true identity as rogue UFB agent Carl Hauser, who was working for UFB Chancellor Cohaagen to infiltrate the Resistance before Hauser defected. He had discovered a kill code that can disable an army of robots that Cohaagen intends to use to destroy the Colony and give the UFB more living space, but was captured by UFB agents and implanted with [[False memory|false memories]] to manipulate him. Nonetheless, Matthias, the Resistance leader, should be able to retrieve the memory of the kill code. Subsequently, Melina reveals she was Hauser's lover before he was captured, comparing their matching scars from when they were shot while holding hands in Quaid's \"dream\". They are soon surrounded by the police and Harry, who claims that Quaid is still in a Rekall-induced dream and killing Melina is the only way out. A confused Quaid is initially uncertain until he sees a tear on Melina's cheek and shoots Harry. Lori pursues the pair, but they manage to escape.\n\nMelina takes Quaid to see Matthias, who searches his memories until Lori and Cohaagen storm the Resistance base. Cohaagen reveals he came up with the idea of the kill code to trick Quaid into leading him to Matthias before killing Matthias, taking Melina prisoner, and ordering a team to restore Quaid's memory to the \"old Hauser\" before he was corrupted. However, Hammond reveals himself and frees Quaid, dying in the process.\n\nCohaagen loads the Fall with his robot army as Quaid sneaks on board, setting timed explosives throughout the vessel while searching for Melina. After reaching the Colony and freeing her, they fight Cohaagen and his soldiers until Quaid's explosives detonate. Quaid and Melina jump off before the vessel plummets back into the tunnel and explodes underground, killing Cohaagen and destroying his army along with the Fall itself.\n\nQuaid wakes up in an ambulance with Melina, whom he soon realizes is a holographically disguised Lori. Quaid eventually kills her before reuniting with the real Melina as news channels declare the Colony\u2019s independence from the UFB.\n\n==Cast==\n<!--- Cast per closing credits order and roles as displayed --->\n* [[Colin Farrell]] as Douglas Quaid / Agent Carl Hauser, a factory worker suffering from strange violent dreams.

This version of the film also uses the names Quaid and Lori for the main character and his wife, like the 1990 film, whereas in the original short story they were Quail and Kirsten. The basic story also follows that of the original 1990 film, albeit with certain changes such as keeping the action on Earth rather than Mars.
