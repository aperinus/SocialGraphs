The film was written and directed by [[Mark Steven Johnson]], known for helming 2003's ''[[Daredevil (film)|Daredevil]]'' previously, and stars [[Nicolas Cage]] as [[Ghost Rider (Johnny Blaze)|Johnny Blaze / Ghost Rider]], with [[Eva Mendes]], [[Wes Bentley]], [[Sam Elliott]], [[Donal Logue]], [[Matt Long]], and [[Peter Fonda]] in supporting roles.\n\n''Ghost Rider'' was released on February 16, 2007, in the United States. The film was met with negative reviews from critics, but was a box office success, earning $228.7 million worldwide on a $110 million budget. ''Ghost Rider'' was released on [[DVD]], [[Blu-ray]] and [[Universal Media Disc|UMD]] on June 12, 2007. A sequel, titled ''[[Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance]]'', was released on February 17, 2012, with Cage reprising his role.\n\n== Plot ==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, the plot summary should be 400-700 words. -->\nThe demon [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephistopheles]] sends his bounty hunter of the damned, the [[Ghost Rider]], to retrieve the contract of San Venganza for control of a thousand corrupt souls. Seeing that the agreement would give Mephistopheles the power to bring hell on Earth, the Rider refuses and escapes with it. In 1986, Mephistopheles reaches out to 17-year-old [[Ghost Rider (Johnny Blaze)|Johnny Blaze]], offering to cure his father's cancer in exchange for Johnny's soul. The next morning, Johnny awakens to discover the cancer cured, but his father dies later that same day from burns sustained in a stunt accident. Johnny accuses Mephistopheles of causing his father's death, but Mephistopheles considers his side of the contract fulfilled and promises to see Johnny again.\n\nMephistopheles' son [[Blackheart]] comes to Earth and seeks aid from the Hidden (three fallen angels bonded with the elements of air, earth, and water) to find the lost contract of San Venganza.\n\nIn 2007, Johnny has become a famous stunt motorcycle rider. He runs into his former sweetheart [[Roxanne Simpson]], now a news reporter, whom he abandoned after his father's death. He convinces her to attend a dinner date.\n\nMephistopheles makes Johnny the new Ghost Rider and offers to return his soul if he defeats Blackheart. Johnny transforms into the Ghost Rider, his flesh burning off his skeleton, and kills the earth angel Gressil. He then uses the Penance Stare, a power that causes mortals to feel all the pain they have caused others, searing their soul, on a street thug. The next day, he meets a man called the [[Caretaker (comics)|Caretaker]], who knows about the Ghost Rider's history. He assures Johnny that what happened was real and will happen again, especially at night, when he is near an evil soul.\n\nJohnny leaves to find Roxanne, who's reporting the previous night's events on the news. At home, Johnny tries to control his firepower. Roxanne comes to visit before leaving town, and Johnny reveals himself as the Devil's bounty hunter. Unconvinced, she walks away in disbelief. After brief imprisonment for murders Blackheart committed, Johnny kills the air angel Abigor and escapes from the police. He returns to the Caretaker, who tells him of his predecessor [[Phantom Rider|Carter Slade]], a [[Texas Ranger Division|Texas Ranger]] who hid the contract of San Venganza. At home, Johnny discovers that Blackheart has killed his friend Mack and taken Roxanne hostage, intending to kill her if Johnny does not deliver the contract. Johnny tries to use the Penance Stare on Blackheart, but it proves ineffective as Blackheart has no soul. Blackheart then orders Johnny to retrieve the contract and bring it to him in San Venganza.\n\nJohnny returns to the Caretaker, demanding the contract to save Roxanne. The Caretaker reveals that it is hidden inside a spade, telling Johnny that he is more powerful than his predecessors because he sold his soul for love rather than greed, before giving the contract. The Caretaker then transforms with Blaze, revealing that the Caretaker was actually Carter Slade. Slade then leads Johnny to San Venganza and gives him a lever-action shotgun before bidding farewell and apparently having finally shaken off the curse, fades into dust as he rides away.\n\nAfter killing the water angel Wallow, Johnny gives Blackheart the contract. He transforms into the Ghost Rider to subdue Blackheart, but is rendered powerless at sunrise. Using the contract to absorb the thousand souls, Blackheart attempts to finish Johnny off, but is distracted when Roxanne uses Johnny's discarded shotgun to separate them. Johnny shoots Blackheart with the gun, holding it in the shadows to allow him to enhance it with his power. Keeping his own body in shadow, he transforms again and uses his Penance Stare to render Blackheart catatonic by burning all the corrupt souls within him. Mephistopheles appears and declares the contract is complete, offering to take back the curse of the Ghost Rider. Determined not to let anyone else make another deal, Johnny declines, declaring that he will use his power against the demon and against all harm that comes to the innocent. Infuriated, Mephistopheles vows to make Johnny pay and disappears with Blackheart's body. Roxanne tells Johnny that he has his second chance and kisses him. Johnny rides away on his motorcycle, preparing for his new life as the Ghost Rider.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Nicolas Cage]] as [[Ghost Rider (Johnny Blaze)|Johnny Blaze / Ghost Rider]]: A motorcycle stunt rider, who is tricked into making a [[deal with the Devil|deal with the demon lord Mephisto]] thinking that it will save his father from dying, and is subsequently transformed into a supernatural demonic soul hunter, the Devil's Spirit of Vengeance, the Ghost Rider.

To pull off such effects as the living morph where the hardtail chopper (\"Grace\") comes alive to become the \"Hell Cycle\", Sony enlisted teams of animators, models, effects artists, lighters & \"Flame\" artists. The department supervisors for these teams at Imageworks included Kevin Hudson, Brian Steiner, JD Cowels, Marco Marenghi, Joe Spadaro, Joanie Karnowski, Vincent Serritella & Patrick Witting. Patrick's team bore the brunt of the work as they created the fire using a custom pipeline that automated the set up starting with Maya animated geometry driving Maya Fluids, imported into Houdini and then rendered & composited on top of the live action plates. Patrick and his team set up the fire process and much of the front end automation was set up by Scott Palleiko and Joe Spadaro. The fire was then tweaked and manipulated to look and move believably by Patrick's eleven man Houdini effects team. All of this was enabled by effects producers Daniel Kuehn and the Digital Effects Supervisor Kee-Suk 'Ken' Hahn.\n\nThe digital version of the hell cycle was modeled in detail by Kevin Hudson and based on the practical prop used in the film, it included animatable skeletal hands that came alive to wrap the gas tank during the supernatural transformation scene. The transformation scene was animated by Max Tyrie and finalized by Joe Spadaro. Each part of the \"Grace\" geometry had to match up and morph with a piece of geometry on the \"Hell Cycle\".\n\nGhost Rider's voice was manipulated by sound designer [[Dane Davis]], who won an [[Academy Award for Sound Editing]] for ''[[The Matrix]]''. Davis filtered Cage's line readings through three different kinds of animal growls that were played backwards and covered separate frequencies. Davis then amplified the dialogue through a mechanical volumizer. Director Johnson described the sound as a \"deep, demonic, mechanical lion's roar\".<ref>{{cite news | url= http://www.superherohype.com/news/ghostridernews.php?id=3374 | title=Mark Steven Johnson on ''Ghost Rider''! | publisher=SuperHeroHype.com | date=2005-08-07 | access-date=2007-01-29}}</ref>\n\n== Music ==\n{{Infobox album\n| name       = Ghost Rider: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack\n| type       = Film\n| artist     = [[Christopher Young]]\n| cover      = \n| caption    =\n| alt        =\n| released   = February 13, 2007\n| recorded   = 2006\n| venue      =\n| studio     =\n| genre      = [[Film score]], [[orchestral]]\n| length     = 56:33\n| label      = [[Var\u00e8se Sarabande]]\n| producer   =\n| prev_title = [[The Grudge 2]]\n| prev_year  = 2006\n| next_title = [[Spider-Man 3#Music|Spider-Man 3]]\n| next_year  = 2007\n}}\n[[Christopher Young]] composed ''Ghost Rider'' score.
