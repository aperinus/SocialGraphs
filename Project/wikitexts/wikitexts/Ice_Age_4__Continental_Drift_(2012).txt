It is the sequel to ''[[Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs]]'' (2009) and the fourth installment  in the [[Ice Age (franchise)|''Ice Age'' film series]]. The film was directed by [[Steve Martino]] and [[Michael Thurmeier]] (in his feature directorial debut). [[Ray Romano]], [[John Leguizamo]], [[Denis Leary]], [[Seann William Scott]], [[Josh Peck]], [[Queen Latifah]], and [[Chris Wedge]] reprise their roles from previous films, with [[Peter Dinklage]], [[Jennifer Lopez]], [[Drake (entertainer)|Drake]], and [[Nicki Minaj]] voicing new characters. The plot focuses on Scrat mistakenly sending Manny, Sid, and Diego adrift on an iceberg with Sid's Granny and causing them to face a gang of pirates led by Captain Gutt on Earth.\n\nThe film was released in the United States on July 13, 2012, as the first ''Ice Age'' film to be presented in the [[anamorphic format|2.40:1]] aspect ratio. The film received mixed reviews. While the performances, animation, score, charm and humor were praised, it was criticized for its plot and unoriginality. Despite receiving mixed reviews from critics, it grossed $879.7 million worldwide, marking it the [[2012 in film#Highest-grossing films|fifth highest-grossing film of 2012]] and the highest-grossing animated film of 2012.<ref name=DeadlineIA5GetsTitle /> A sequel, ''[[Ice Age: Collision Course]]'', was released in 2016.\n\n==Plot==\nSome time after the events of [[Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs|the third film]], Manny and Ellie are living happily with their teenage daughter Peaches. However, while Ellie supports and accepts her daughter\u2019s desire to explore and meet new people, Manny instead becomes exceedingly overprotective, irritating Peaches and driving a wedge between the two. Meanwhile, Sid's family returns, but only to drop off the elderly Granny before promptly abandoning them both. Manny then catches Peaches hanging out with a group of teenage mammoths he does not approve of, causing a fight between him and Peaches. Shortly after, a sudden continental break-up (caused by Scrat trying to bury his acorn again) traps Manny, Sid, Diego and Granny on moving chunks of ice, giving them no choice but to ride the current and separating them from Ellie, Peaches and the rest of the animals, who remain on land, causing Peaches to feel guilty over her fight with her father. At the same time, a giant land shift [[subduction|encroaches]] on those remaining on land, forcing them to make their way towards a [[land bridge]] in order to get to safety under Ellie's lead. Meanwhile, Scrat finds another acorn at the bottom of the ocean, but a broken one that, inside, shows a map to \"The Lost City Of Scratlantis\" which Scrat sets off for.\n\nAfter encountering a violent [[hurricane]] which pushes them further away from land, Manny's group is captured by a band of [[pirates]] sailing on a floating [[iceberg]] [[pirate ship]] led by a [[Gigantopithecus]], Captain Gutt, who attempts to pressure them into joining his crew. When Manny refuses, Gutt tries to execute them; this leads to their escape, which inadvertently causes the ship and food supplies to sink. Gutt's [[first mate]], a female [[saber-toothed cat|sabretooth]] named Shira, is forced to join them after she is rescued after being left for dead by her crew mates.\n\nThe Herd washes ashore on Switchback Cove, which gives a current back to their home. After learning that Gutt has enslaved a group of [[hyrax]] and is using them to build a new iceberg ship, Manny coordinates a plan with some more hyrax to free their comrades and steal the ship, and they are able to create a diversion. Just before they manage to escape aboard the ship, Diego, having fallen in love with Shira, tries to convince her to leave the pirates and join The Herd for a better life, but Shira, starting to reciprocate Diego's feelings, while initially accepting, instead stays behind and slows Gutt down so The Herd can escape. Gutt forms yet another ship and plots revenge on Manny.\n\nMeanwhile, during the animals' trek to the land bridge back on the mainland, Peaches joins the group of mammoths from before, only to find out that they do not care about the ongoing danger and they look down on her for being friends with a mole hog named Louis. When Louis overhears Peaches telling the other mammoths that they are not actually friends, Peaches realises who her true friends are, berates the others for their cocky attitudes and storms off.\n\nAfter narrowly escaping a pack of [[Siren (mythology)|sirens]], Manny, Sid, Diego, and Granny return home and find that not only has the land bridge been destroyed, but Gutt has beaten them and taken Ellie, Peaches, and the rest of The Herd hostage. Louis faces Gutt to save Peaches, ignoring what she said about them earlier, ensuing a fight, as Granny's pet whale, Precious, arrives and fends off Gutt's crew. Peaches saves Ellie, causing Manny to finally realize she has grown up. Manny defeats Gutt in a final duel on an ice floe before he is saved by Precious from falling into the ocean. Gutt subsequently encounters a siren that assumes the shape of a female Gigantopithecus, who eats him alive by trapping him in a giant clam. In the aftermath, Peaches happily reconciles with both Louis and Manny, who is finally reunited with his family and friends, and Shira joins The Herd and starts a romantic relationship with Diego. With their home destroyed by the land shift, Precious takes the entire Herd to a lush island, where the hyraxes from earlier have already started rebuilding their civilization.\n\nIn the epilogue, Scrat finally reaches Scratlantis, where Ariscratle welcomes him. When Scrat sees the acorns everywhere, he is overpowered by them and is eagerly hyperactive. When Ariscratle warns him not to take anymore, Scrat unsuccessfully attempts resistance, but then pulls a giant acorn plug where water comes in and flushes the entire city down, taking Ariscratle and the other residents with it in the process. Scrat survives, but when trying to dig where the city is now, the ground cracks as he, to his frustration, is in a dry desert known as the [[Death Valley]].\n\n==Voice cast==\n{{See also |List of Ice

name=ScreenRushIA4Confirmed /> In addition to Powell's original score, the film also features [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]]'s [[Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)|9th Symphony]]. Powell explained his decision: \"At the beginning of the film, the creation of the geographical world as we know it seemed just such an immense idea to musically convey, that I gave up entirely and used Beethoven's Ninth Symphony instead. With a bit of obscenely crass re-orchestration and blatantly cheap arranging tricks normally associated with strippers, we got it to fit the action perfectly.
