Directed by [[Ron Howard]], produced by [[Lucasfilm]], and distributed by [[Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures]], it is the second [[List of Star Wars films#Anthology films|''Star Wars'' anthology film]], following ''[[Rogue One]]'' (2016). [[Alden Ehrenreich]] stars as Solo, with [[Woody Harrelson]], [[Emilia Clarke]], [[Donald Glover]], [[Thandiwe Newton]], [[Phoebe Waller-Bridge]], [[Joonas Suotamo]] and [[Paul Bettany]]. The film explores the early adventures of Han Solo and Chewbacca, who join a heist within the criminal underworld 10 years prior to the events of the original ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]''.\n\n[[George Lucas]] began developing a Han Solo prequel in 2012, and commissioned [[Lawrence Kasdan]] to write the screenplay. After Lucas sold Lucasfilm to Disney in 2012, Kasdan was hired to write ''[[Star Wars: The Force Awakens]]'' (2015), leaving his son [[Jonathan Kasdan|Jonathan]] to complete the ''Solo'' script''.'' [[Principal photography]] began in January 2017 at [[Pinewood Studios]], with directors [[Phil Lord and Christopher Miller]].

They bribe an [[Galactic Empire (Star Wars)|Imperial]] officer with stolen starship fuel, known as coaxium, for passage on a transport, but Qi'ra is captured before she can board. Han vows to return for her and joins the Imperial Navy as a flight cadet, being given the surname \"Solo\".\n\nThree years later, Han is serving as an infantryman on [[Mimban]] following his expulsion from the Imperial Flight Academy for insubordination. He encounters a trio of criminals posing as Imperial soldiers, led by [[Tobias Beckett]]. Han attempts to blackmail Beckett into letting him join the gang, but Beckett has him arrested and thrown into a pit to be fed to a [[Wookiee]] prisoner named [[Chewbacca]]. Able to understand Chewbacca's language, Han persuades him to cooperate to escape. Beckett, aware of the usefulness of a Wookiee's strength, rescues and enlists them in the gang to steal a shipment of coaxium on Vandor-1. The plan fails when the Cloud Riders, a band of [[space pirate]]s led by [[Enfys Nest]], arrive to hijack the shipment. The resulting chaos leads to the destruction of the coaxium and the deaths of Beckett's partner Val and their crewman Rio.\n\nBeckett reveals that he was ordered to steal the shipment for [[Dryden Vos]], a high-ranking crime boss in the Crimson Dawn syndicate. Han and Chewbacca volunteer to help him steal another shipment to repay the debt so that Vos will not kill him. They travel to Vos's yacht where Han finds Qi'ra, who has joined Crimson Dawn as Vos's top lieutenant. Han suggests a risky plan to steal unrefined coaxium from the mines on [[Kessel (Star Wars)|Kessel]]. Vos approves, but insists that Qi'ra accompany the team. She leads them to [[Lando Calrissian]], a smuggler and pilot, who she hopes will lend them his ship, the ''[[Millennium Falcon]]''. Han challenges Lando to a game of cards, with the wager being Lando's ship. Lando cheats to win but agrees to join the mission in exchange for a share of the profits.\n\nAfter reaching Kessel in the ''Falcon'' and infiltrating the mine, Lando's droid co-pilot L3-37 instigates a [[Slave rebellion|slave revolt]]. They steal the coaxium, but L3 is fatally damaged in the confusion and Lando is wounded during the escape. With the help of L3's navigational data, uploaded into the ship's systems, Han pilots the ship through the dangerous and uncharted [[Millennium Falcon#Kessel Run|Kessel Run]] to elude an Imperial blockade. The ''Falcon'', badly damaged, lands on the planet [[Savareen]] to process the coaxium.\n\nEnfys arrives, having tracked the team from Vandor, and Lando leaves in the ''Falcon'', deserting everyone else. Enfys reveals that she and her crew are rebels trying to strike back at the syndicates and the Empire. Han becomes sympathetic to their cause and tries to trick Vos, who reveals Beckett has already alerted him to the double-cross. Vos sends his guards to kill Enfys, but the Cloud Riders overpower them, leaving Vos defenseless. Having anticipated Vos's strategy, Han tries to take the coaxium, but Beckett betrays Vos and escapes with it, taking Chewbacca hostage. Qi'ra kills Vos and sends Han after Beckett. She contacts Vos's superior, [[Darth Maul|Maul]],<!--Per film credits, do not add 'Darth'--> to inform him of the mission's failure, which she blames on Beckett. Maul orders Qi'ra to meet with him on [[Dathomir]].\n\nHan confronts Beckett and shoots him dead<!-- Do not link this to \"Han shot first\" per WP:EASTEREGG--> before he can return fire. Qi'ra leaves in Vos's yacht, while Han and Chewbacca give the coaxium to Enfys, who offers Han a chance to join the rebellion<!-- DO NOT link to Rebel Alliance.

He declines, and she gives him a vial of coaxium, enough to purchase a ship of his own.\n\nHan and Chewbacca locate Lando and challenge him to a rematch, once again wagering the ''Falcon''. This time Han wins in a fair game after having stolen the hidden card from Lando that he used to cheat his way to victory the first time. Han and Chewbacca then leave for [[Tatooine]] to find the crime lord <!--Do not link this to Jabba the Hutt as it's an [[WP:EASTEREGG|Easter egg link]].--> mentioned by Beckett who is putting together a big, profitable job.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{Main|List of Star Wars characters|List of Star Wars cast members}}\n[[File:Solo_A_Star_Wars_Story_Japan_Premiere_Red_Carpet_Alden_Ehrenreich_(41008143870).jpg|thumb|upright|right|Alden Ehrenreich starred in the title role of [[Han Solo]].]]\n<!-- Order per http://www.starwars.com/news/han-solo-smuggler-scoundrel-hero-new-star-wars-story-begins -->\n* [[Alden Ehrenreich]] as [[Han Solo]]: A cynical smuggler who joins Beckett's crew.<ref name=\"Enrenreich\" /><ref name=\"EnrenreichConfirm\" /> When asked how ''Solo'' differs from Han's appearance in other [[List of Star Wars films|''Star Wars'' films]], Ehrenreich stated, \"I think the main thing that's different is that the Han we meet in this film is more of an idealist.
