The story follows two friends who need to win at high-stakes poker to quickly pay off a large debt. The term ''[[Card sharp|rounder]]'' refers to a person traveling around from city to city seeking high-stakes card games.\n\n''Rounders'' opened to mixed reviews and was moderately successful at the box office. Following the [[poker boom]] in the early 2000s, the film became a [[Cult film|cult hit]].\n\n== Plot ==\n[[New York City]] law student and gifted [[poker]] player Mike McDermott ([[Matt Damon]]) dreams of winning the [[World Series of Poker]]. At an underground [[Texas hold 'em]] game run by [[Russian mafia|Russian mobster]] Teddy \"KGB\" ([[John Malkovich]]), an overconfident Mike loses his entire $30,000 bankroll in a single hand. Shaken, he promises his girlfriend and fellow student Jo ([[Gretchen Mol]]) he has quit poker, and concentrates on law school. His mentor Joey Knish ([[John Turturro]]) offers to stake him to rebuild his bankroll but Mike declines, and instead accepts a part-time job to make ends meet.\n\nSeveral months pass and Mike stays true to his promise until his childhood friend Lester \"Worm\" Murphy ([[Edward Norton]]) is released from prison. While Mike is an honest player, Worm is a hustler and unapologetic cheat. To help Worm pay off a debt, Mike sets him up with games across town and reluctantly sits in on a game, interfering with his studies and his relationship with Jo. Mike allows Worm to play on his credit at the Chesterfield Club; however, after a profitable session, he takes the profit and a loan, beginning a tab in Mike's name. Worm runs into Grama ([[Michael Rispoli]]), a dangerous [[pimp]], who has bought Worm\u2019s debt \u2013 Worm now owes $25,000 directly to Grama, who is working for KGB. Grama takes Worm\u2019s $10,000 he left the Chesterfield with, threatening him to pay the rest. As Mike returns to his poker lifestyle and friends, Jo ends their relationship.\n\nMike learns from Petra ([[Famke Janssen]]) at the Chesterfield that Worm has now racked up a $7,000 debt in Mike\u2019s name. In [[Atlantic City]], Worm tells Mike about his debt to Grama but withholds that he is working for KGB. Mike proposes to Grama that Worm pay weekly installments; Grama considers the offer but also mocks Worm for his inability to pay him. Worm responds by insulting Grama and as the two nearly come to blows; Mike defuses the situation by agreeing to vouch for Worm and an angry Grama gives them five days to pay the remaining $15,000. Mike decides to help Worm win the money by playing in several games in and around the city.\n\nOn a winning streak, Mike earns $7,200 in three days, but still needs to double it in forty-eight hours. Worm directs Mike to an out-of-town game hosted by [[New York State Police|New York state troopers]], where he wins almost the full $15,000 before Worm unexpectedly joins the game. The [[Trooper (police rank)|troopers]] catch Worm [[bottom dealing|base-dealing]] to help Mike; they are beaten up and relieved of their entire bankroll. Worm finally confesses that Grama is working for KGB. With their lives in danger Worm decides to flee, but Mike returns to the city, cutting ties with Worm.\n\nMike asks Grama for more time, to no avail. He asks Knish for the money but is refused out of principle. During the conversation with Knish, Mike reveals his motivation for taking the ill-fated risk at KGB's club (citing beating poker legend [[Johnny Chan]] at a single hand in Atlantic City), and why he thinks he can compete and possibly win the World Series of Poker. Knish stays firm. Desperate, Mike asks his law school professor Petrovsky ([[Martin Landau]]), who loans him $10,000. Mike challenges KGB to a second [[Heads-up poker|heads-up]] [[List of poker variants|no-limit Texas hold'em]] game for the remaining debt, with winner-take-all stakes, which KGB accepts. Mike beats KGB in the first session, winning $20,000. KGB offers to let Mike\u2019s winnings \"ride\" and continue the game, but Mike \u2013 with enough to pay off most of his debts \u2013 declines. As he is about to leave, KGB taunts Mike that he is paying him with the money that he lost to KGB from their previous game. Mike changes his mind and decides to continue playing.\n\nMike doubles the blinds at the risk of losing everything to KGB again, and possibly his life. As the night wears on, he spots KGB's [[Tell (poker)|tell]] and folds, deducing that KGB has a better hand. Irate at the missed chance to win it all, KGB begins to play on [[Tilt (poker)|\"tilt\"]]. In the final hand, Mike baits a boastful KGB into going all-in and defeats him with a [[nut straight]]. KGB throws a tantrum at having been lured into a mistake. Despite Grama\u2019s urging, KGB, rattled, calls off his goons and admits that Mike won fairly, allowing him to leave with his winnings.\n\nWith over $60,000, Mike settles Worm\u2019s $15,000 debt to Grama, the Chesterfield\u2019s $6,000 credit, Petrovsky\u2019s $10,000 loan, and restores his original bankroll of \"three stacks of high society.\" He drops out of law school, says goodbye to Jo, and leaves New York for [[Las Vegas]] to play in the World Series of Poker.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Matt Damon]] as Mike McDermott\n* [[Edward Norton]] as Lester \"Worm\" Murphy\n* [[John Malkovich]] as Teddy \"KGB\"\n* [[John Turturro]] as Joey Knish\u2020\n* [[Famke Janssen]] as Petra\n* [[Murphy Guyer]] as Sergeant Detweiler\n* [[Michael Rispoli]] as Grama\n* [[Martin Landau]] as Judge Abe Petrovsky\n* [[Gretchen Mol]] as Jo\n* Paul Cicero as Russian Thug\n* [[Melina Kanakaredes]] as Barbara\n* [[Josh Mostel]] as Zagosh\n* [[Tom Aldredge]] as Judge Marinacci\n* [[Michael Lombard]] as District Attorney Shields\n* [[Lenny Clarke]] as Savino \n* [[Chris Messina]] as Higgins\n* [[Goran Vi\u0161nji\u0107]] as Maurice \n* [[David Zayas]] as Trooper Osborne\n* [[Johnny Chan]] as Himself\n* [[Bill Camp]] as Eisenberg\n* [[Josh Pais]] as Weitz\n* [[Adam LeFevre]] as Sean Frye\n{{div col end}}\n\n\u2020 Turturro's character was based on underground poker player Joel \"Bagels\" Rosenberg<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.pokernewsdaily.com/joel-bagels-rosenberg-aka-joey-knish-passes-away-25753/|title=Joel \"Bagels\" Rosenberg, aka Joey Knish, Passes Away|website=www.pokernewsdaily.com|access-date=May 4, 2016}}</ref>\n\n== Production ==\n[[Principal photography]] for ''Rounders'' began in December 1997; it took place mostly in New York City.
