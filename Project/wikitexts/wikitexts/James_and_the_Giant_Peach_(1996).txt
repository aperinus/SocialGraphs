The film is a combination of live action and [[Stop motion|stop-motion animation]]. Co-stars [[Joanna Lumley]] and [[Miriam Margolyes]] played James's aunts in the live-action segments, and [[Simon Callow]], [[Richard Dreyfuss]], [[Susan Sarandon]], [[Jane Leeves]], [[David Thewlis]], and Margolyes voiced his insect friends in the animation sequences.\n\nReleased on April 12, 1996 in the [[United States]], the film received generally positive reviews from critics, who praised its story and visual aspects.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- On an edit on April 30, 2021, this plot section was reduced from 606 to 410 words. Per WP:FILMPLOT, you must keep the word count between 400 to 700 and make sure it's only \"an overview of the film's main events, so avoid minutiae like dialogue, scene-by-scene breakdowns, individual jokes, and technical detail.\"  -->\nIn summer 1948, James Henry Trotter is a young orphan living with his sadistic and domineering aunts Spiker and Sponge. One day, after rescuing a spider from his hysterical aunts, James obtains magical \"crocodile tongues\" from a mysterious old man, which grows a colossal peach on nearby old peach tree that Spiker and Sponge exploit as a tourist attraction. At night, James eats through the peach to find a pit with several human-sized [[anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] invertebrates: Mr. Grasshopper, Mr. Centipede, Ms. Spider (who was actually the spider he saved from Spiker and Sponge), Mr. Earthworm, Mrs. Ladybug, and Mrs. Glowworm. As they hear Spiker and Sponge searching for James, Centipede cuts the stem connecting the peach to the tree and the peach rolls away to the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nThe invertebrates drive on the peach to New York City, as James has dreamed of visiting the [[Empire State Building]] like his parents wanted to. Obstacles include a giant mechanical shark and undead skeletal pirates in the icy waters of the Arctic. When the group arrive, they are suddenly attacked by the tempestuous form of the [[rhinoceros]] that killed James' parents. James, though frightened, gets his friends to safety and confronts the rhino before it strikes the peach with lightning. James and the peach fall to the city below, landing on top of the Empire State Building. After he is rescued by firefighters, Spiker and Sponge arrive and attempt to claim James and the peach. James tells the crowd of his fantastical adventure and exposes his aunts' mistreatment. Enraged at James' betrayal, Spiker and Sponge attempt to hack James with stolen fire axes, but are stopped by the insects and arrested by the police.\n\nJames introduces his friends to the New Yorkers and allows the children to eat up the peach. The peach pit is made into a cottage in Central Park, where James lives happily with the bugs, who form his new family and also find success and fame in the city. Mr. Centipede runs for New York mayor and is now James\u2019 father, Miss Spider opens a club and is now his mother, Mr. Earthworm becomes a mascot for a skin-care company and is now either James' uncle or cousin, Mrs. Ladybug becomes an obstetrician and is James' aunt, Mr. Grasshopper becomes a concert violinist and is now James' grandfather, and Mrs. Glowworm becomes the light in the torch of the [[Statue of Liberty]] and is now his grandmother. James celebrates his ninth birthday with his new family and friends.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Paul Terry (actor)|Paul Terry]] as James Henry Trotter\n* [[Miriam Margolyes]] as Aunt Sponge\n* [[Joanna Lumley]] as Aunt Spiker\n* [[Pete Postlethwaite]] as Narrator/the Magic Man\n* [[Steven Culp]] as James' Father\n* Susan Turner-Cray as James' Mother\n* [[Mike Starr (actor)|Mike Starr]] as Beat Cop\n\n===Voices===\n* [[Simon Callow]] as Mr. Grasshopper\n* [[Richard Dreyfuss]] as Mr. Centipede\n* [[Jeff Bennett]] as Mr. Centipede (singing voice)\n* [[Jane Leeves]] as Mrs. Ladybug\n* [[Susan Sarandon]] as Miss Spider\n* [[David Thewlis]] as Mr. Earthworm\n* [[Miriam Margolyes]] as Mrs. Glowworm\n\n== Production ==\nAt [[Walt Disney Animation Studios]] in the early 1980s, [[Joe Ranft]] tried to convince the staff to produce a film based on [[Roald Dahl]]'s ''[[James and the Giant Peach]]'' (1961), a book that enamored him with its \"liberating\" material ever since he first read it in third grade.{{Sfn|French|1996b|p=25}} However, Disney refused for reasons of a potentially expensive and difficult animation process and the source material's weird subject matter.{{Sfn|French|1996b|p=25}} Among the animators exposed to the book by Ranft was [[Henry Selick]]; while he enjoyed the book and thought about adapting it to screen for several years, he understood the obstacles doing so, such as the source material's dreamy nature, episodic structure, and the reputation of other Dahl books being so agitational some parts of the world banned them.{{Sfn|French|1996b|p=25}}\n\n[[Felicity Dahl]], Roald's widow and executor of his estate, began offering film rights to the book in the summer in 1992; among those interested included [[Steven Spielberg]] and [[Danny DeVito]].<ref name = \"Thompson1996\">{{cite web|last=Thompson|first=Anne|date=April 26, 1996|url=https://ew.com/article/1996/04/26/behind-scenes-james-and-giant-peach/|title=Behind the scenes of 'James and the Giant Peach'|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|accessdate=July 5, 2021}}</ref>{{Sfn|French|1996b|p=27}}\n\n[[Walt Disney Pictures]] acquired the film rights to the book from the Dahl estate in 1992.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Setoodah|first1=Ramin|title=From 'The BFG' to 'Matilda': How 5 Roald Dahl Books Landed on the Big Screen|url=https://variety.com/2016/film/news/roald-dahl-movies-bfg-steven-spielberg-matilda-1201806205/|access-date=July 8, 2016|work=Variety|date=July 29, 2016}}</ref> Brian Rosen was hired as producer by Disney for his experience in animated projects like ''[[FernGully: The Last Rainforest]]'' (1992) and live-action films such as ''Mushrooms'' (1995).{{Sfn|French|1996a|p=7}}\n\n[[Dennis Potter]] was hired to write a draft. Rosen descripted it as \"slightly black and bizarre\", a tone Disney did not approve of, particularly with the sharks being [[Nazi]]s.
