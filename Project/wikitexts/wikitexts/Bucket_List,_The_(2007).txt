Despite receiving mixed reviews from critics, the film was chosen by [[National Board of Review]] as one of the [[National Board of Review Awards 2007#Top 10 Films|top ten films of 2007]] and was a box office success, opening at #1 in the United States, and grossing $175.4 million worldwide.\n\n==Plot==\nTwo elderly men, [[blue-collar]] automotive mechanic Carter Chambers and billionaire Edward Cole meet for the first time in a hospital owned by Edward after both men are diagnosed with terminal [[lung cancer]]. \n\nCarter, a gifted [[gentleman amateur|amateur]] historian and family man, wanted to become a history professor in his youth but chose to start a family instead. Edward, a four-time divorced healthcare tycoon and cultured loner, enjoys drinking [[kopi luwak]], one of the most expensive coffees in the world and tormenting his personal [[valet]] Matthew, whom he wrongly but intentionally calls Thomas.\n\nWhile in the hospital, Carter and Edward manage to find common ground. For fun, Carter started writing a list of activities to do before he \"[[kick the bucket|kicks the bucket]].\" After hearing he has less than a year to live, he dejectedly discards his list. \n\nEdward finds the list the next morning and urges him to do everything on it, adds his own items and offers to finance all expenses. Carter agrees and though his wife Virginia objects, the two patients begin their globetrotting last vacation along with Matthew. They go [[skydiving]], drive a vintage [[Shelby Mustang]] and [[Dodge Challenger]] around [[Auto Club Speedway|California Speedway]], fly over the [[North Pole]], eat dinner at [[Chevre d'or]], visit the [[Taj Mahal]], ride motorcycles on the [[Great Wall of China]], attend a lion [[safari]] in [[Tanzania]] and visit [[Mount Everest]].\n\nAtop the [[Great Pyramid of Giza]], they confide mutually about faith and family. Carter reveals that he has long been feeling less in love with his wife and feels some regret for his chosen path. Edward discloses that he is deeply hurt by his estrangement from his only daughter, who disowned him after he drove away her [[domestic violence|abusive]] husband. Later, while in [[Hong Kong]], Edward hires a [[prostitute]] to approach Carter, who has never been with any woman but his wife. Carter declines and insists they stop the bucket list and go home.\n\nDuring the return journey, Carter tries to reunite Edward with his estranged daughter. Considering this a breach of trust, Edward scolds Carter and then angrily storms off. Carter returns home to his family while Edward, feeling alone though among [[escort agency|escorts]], breaks down weeping in his luxury high-rise suite. Carter\u2019s family reunion turns out to be short-lived as while readying for marital romance, he collapses and is rushed to the hospital, where it is discovered that the cancer has spread to his brain. Edward, now in a remarkable [[Remission (medicine)|remission]], visits him to reconcile. \n\nCarter, always a ''[[Jeopardy!]]'' fan knowledgeable about trivia, reveals how Edward's kopi luwak coffee is fed to and defecated by a [[Asian palm civet|jungle cat]] before being harvested. As the two laugh hysterically over the obscure fact, Carter implores Edward to finish the list for him.\n\nAfter Carter dies during surgery, Edward manages to reconcile with his own daughter and she introduces him to the granddaughter he never knew he had. After greeting the little girl by kissing her cheek, Edward thoughtfully crosses \"kiss the most beautiful girl in the world\" off the bucket list. Soon after, Edward delivers a [[eulogy]] at Carter\u2019s funeral, during which he explains that the last three months of Carter's life were, thanks to Carter, the best three months of his own.\n\nAn [[epilogue]] reveals that Edward lived to age 81 and Matthew then took his ashes to a peak in the [[Himalayas]]. As Matthew places a [[Chock full o'Nuts]] coffee can of Edward's ashes alongside another can of Carter's ashes, he crosses off the last item on the bucket list, \"witness something truly majestic\" and tucks the completed list between the cans.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Jack Nicholson]] as Edward Perriman Cole\n* [[Morgan Freeman]] as Carter Chambers\n* [[Sean Hayes]] as Matthew / Thomas\n* [[Beverly Todd]] as Virginia Chambers\n* [[Rob Morrow]] as Dr. Hollins\n* [[Alfonso Freeman]] as Roger Chambers\n* [[Rowena King]] as Angelica\n* Jennifer DeFrancisco as Emily Cole\n* [[Serena Reeder]] as Rachel\n* Annton Berry Jr. as Kai\n* Verda Bridges as Chandra\n* Destiny Brownridge as Maya\n* [[Brian Copeland]] as Lee\n* [[Ian Anthony Dale]] as Instructor\n* [[Noel Guglielmi]] as Mechanic\n* Jonathan Hernandez as Manny\n* Andrea J.
