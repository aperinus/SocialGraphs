Weber]], based on the 2008 novel of the same name by Tim Tharp. It stars [[Miles Teller]] (in his first film lead role) and [[Shailene Woodley]] as two high-schoolers Sutter and Aimee, whose unexpected encounter leads to a romance blossoming between the two. [[Brie Larson]], [[Mary Elizabeth Winstead]], [[Bob Odenkirk]], [[Jennifer Jason Leigh]], and [[Kyle Chandler]] are featured in supporting roles.\n\n''The Spectacular Now'' premiered at the [[2013 Sundance Film Festival]], and was theatrically released in the United States on August 2, 2013 where the film garnered critical acclaim, and grossed over $6 million worldwide. It received two nominations at the [[29th Independent Spirit Awards]]; [[Independent Spirit Award for Best Female Lead|Best Female Lead]] (for Woodley), and [[Independent Spirit Award for Best Screenplay|Best Screenplay]].\n\n==Plot==\nSutter Keely (Teller) is a charming and popular 18-year-old who has spent his senior year of high school partying and drinking alcohol. When his girlfriend Cassidy Roy (Larson) breaks up with him, Sutter goes home and writes a college application supplement, in which he says that his biggest hardship in life has been getting dumped by her. He goes out and gets blackout drunk after sneaking into a bar.\n\nThe next morning, Sutter is woken up on a front lawn by Aimee Finecky (Woodley), a girl in his year whose name he does not know. Aimee is in the middle of her mother's paper route, and Sutter joins her to track down his car. The next day, he asks her to tutor him in geometry. He learns that she is smart, funny and into sci-fi and comics. Sutter goes home and deletes the supplement he wrote about his life's biggest hardship. He takes Aimee to a party the next day, and they go for a walk and drink. Aimee confesses she has never been drunk before, never had a boyfriend and does not think she can go to college because she has to take care of her mother. Sutter tells her she is not responsible for her mother before complimenting and kissing her.\n\nThe next morning, Sutter wakes up hungover and realizes that he asked Aimee to prom at the party. He avoids Aimee during school and goes to Cassidy's house that night. They get drunk in her room and reminisce, but Cassidy tells him they have no future together and asks him to leave. After Aimee's friend warns Sutter not to hurt Aimee, Sutter takes Aimee to dinner at his sister Holly's house, where Aimee talks frankly about the death of her father from an opiate overdose and her dreams of a perfect marriage. Sutter and Aimee's relationship grows more serious and they eventually have sex. Afterward, Sutter confesses that his mother Sara (Leigh) kicked his father Tommy (Chandler) out when he was a child and has forbidden Sutter from seeing him, and the pair makes a pact to stand up to their mothers.\n\nOn prom night, Sutter gifts Aimee a flask so they can drink together. After the dance, Aimee tells him that she is going to college in Philadelphia near her sister, who can help her find an apartment and a job. She asks Sutter to come with her and go to junior college, and he hesitantly agrees. Sutter gets his father's phone number from Holly and arranges to meet up to attend a baseball game, bringing Aimee with him. Tommy answers the door, under the influence, and admits he forgot about their plans and instead takes them to a local bar. Midway through the night, Tommy picks up a woman, asks Sutter to pick up the tab and to meet him back at his motel. But when he fails to arrive, they find him immediately back at the bar drinking with his friends. Sutter and Aimee leave, heartbroken.\n\nAimee attempts to comfort Sutter and says she loves him, but Sutter, angry and drunk, snaps at her. After almost causing an accident, he tells her he is bad for her and forces her out of the car. Aimee, crying and not paying attention to the road, is clipped by a passing car. Aimee's arm is broken but she forgives Sutter for the incident. After the graduation ceremony, Sutter refuses to drink with Aimee and talks to Cassidy, who tells Sutter that she is moving to California with her boyfriend. Later, Sutter's boss tells him he can only afford to keep one employee and would like to keep Sutter, who is good with customers, but only if he no longer keeps working drunk. Unable to guarantee his sobriety, Sutter quits.\n\nSutter drives past Aimee, who is waiting for him by the bus to Philadelphia, leaving her heartbroken. He gets drunk at a bar, drives home and totals his mailbox. After an argument with Sara, Sutter reassesses his life and completes the personal statement for his college application, despite having missed the submission deadline. He confesses that his biggest hardship is himself and his insistence to only live in the moment. He drives to Philadelphia and finds Aimee as she is leaving class. They make eye contact, and Aimee smiles ambivalently before the scene cuts.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Miles Teller]] as Sutter Keely\n* [[Shailene Woodley]] as Aimee Finecky\n* [[Brie Larson]] as Cassidy Roy\n* [[Jennifer Jason Leigh]] as Sara Keely\n* [[Kyle Chandler]] as Tommy Keely\n* [[Mary Elizabeth Winstead]] as Holly Keely\n* [[Dayo Okeniyi]] as Marcus West\n* [[Andre Royo]] as Mr. Aster\n* [[Bob Odenkirk]] as Dan\n* [[Kaitlyn Dever]] as Krystal\n* Masam Holden as Ricky\n* [[Gary Weeks]] as Joe\n* Whitney Goin as Mrs. Finecky\n* Nicci Faires as Tara\n}}\n\n==Production==\nThe rights to the novel were first acquired by [[Searchlight Pictures|Fox Searchlight Pictures]] in 2009.

Do you have any idea how rare that is? They aren't crippled by irony. They aren't speeded up into cartoons. Their sex lives aren't insulted by scenes that treat them cheaply [...] What an affecting film this is. It respects its characters and doesn't use them for its own shabby purposes. How deeply we care about them. Miles Teller and Shailene Woodley are so ''there''. Being young is a solemn business when you really care about someone. Teller has a touch of [[John Cusack]] in his ''[[Say Anything...|Say Anything]]'' period. Woodley is beautiful in a real person sort of way, studying him with concern, and then that warm smile. We have gone through senior year with these two. We have known them.
