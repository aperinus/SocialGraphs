The film stars [[Ian McKellen]], [[Brendan Fraser]], [[Lynn Redgrave]], [[Lolita Davidovich]], and [[David Dukes]]. An international co-production between the United Kingdom and the United States, the film is written and directed by [[Bill Condon]], based on [[Christopher Bram]]'s 1995 novel ''[[Father of Frankenstein]]''. The film is produced by [[Paul Colichman]], [[Gregg Fienberg]], and Mark R. Harris; [[Clive Barker]] served as executive producer.<ref>{{cite magazine|url= https://variety.com/1998/film/reviews/gods-and-monsters-1200452505/#!|title=Gods and Monsters|last=Harvey|first=Dennis|magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=January 24, 1998|accessdate=May 13, 2021}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.indiewire.com/1998/11/from-candyman-to-frankenstein-bill-condon-talks-gods-and-monsters-82502/|title= From Candyman to Frankenstein, Bill Condon Talks \"Gods and Monsters\"|last=Kaufman|first=Anthony|work=[[IndieWire]]|date=November 11, 1998|accessdate=May 13, 2021}}</ref> Despite positive reviews, the film was a [[box-office bomb|box office failure]].\n\n''Gods and Monsters'' was nominated for three academy awards, including [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] for McKellen and [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]] for Redgrave, and won for [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Adapted Screenplay]].<ref name=\"Oscars1999\" /> The film features reconstructions of the production of the 1935 film ''[[Bride of Frankenstein]]'', which Whale directed. The title ''Gods and Monsters'' is derived from a scene in ''[[Bride of Frankenstein]]'', in which the character [[Dr. Pretorius]] toasts [[Dr. Frankenstein]], \"To a new world of gods and monsters!\" The story has also been adapted as a play of the same name which premiered in London at the [[Southwark Playhouse]] in February 2015.\n\n==Plot==\nIn the 1950s, [[James Whale]], the director of ''[[Frankenstein (1931 film)|Frankenstein]]'' and ''[[Bride of Frankenstein]]'', has retired. Whale lives with his long-time housemaid, Hanna, who loyally cares for him but disapproves of his [[homosexuality]]. He has suffered a series of [[stroke]]s that have left him fragile and tormented by memories: growing up as a poor outcast, his tragic [[World War I]] service, and the filming of ''Bride of Frankenstein''. Whale slips into his past and indulges in his fantasies, reminiscing about gay pool parties and sexually teasing an embarrassed, starstruck fan. He battles [[depression (mood)|depression]], and at times contemplates [[suicide]], as he realizes his life, his attractiveness, and his health are slipping away.\n\nWhale befriends his young, handsome gardener, Clayton Boone, and the two begin a sometimes uneasy friendship as Boone poses for Whale's sketches. The two men bond while discussing their lives and dealing with Whale's spells of disorientation and weakness from the strokes. Boone, impressed with Whale's fame, watches ''Bride of Frankenstein'' on television as his friends mock the movie, his friendship with Whale, and Whale's intentions.\n\nBoone assures Whale that he is straight and receives Whale's assurance that there is no sexual interest, but Boone storms out when Whale graphically discusses his sexual history. Boone later returns with the agreement that no such \"locker room\" discussions occur again. Boone is invited to escort Whale to a party hosted by [[George Cukor]] for [[Princess Margaret, Countess of Snowdon|Princess Margaret]]. There, a photo op has been arranged for Whale with \"his Monsters\": [[Boris Karloff]] and [[Elsa Lanchester]] from \"ancient\" movie fame. This event exacerbates Whale's depression. A sudden rainstorm becomes an excuse to leave.\n\nBack at Whale's home, Clayton needs a dry change of clothes. Whale can only find a sweater, so Clayton wears a towel wrapped around his waist. Whale decides to try to sketch Clayton one more time. After some minutes, he shows his sketches to Clayton, disclosing that he has lost his ability to draw. After Clayton drops his towel to pose nude, Whale makes him wear a [[World War I gas mask]] and then uses the opportunity to make a sexual advance on Clayton, kissing his shoulder and neck, and forcefully reaches for his genitals. An enraged Clayton fights off Whale, who confesses that this had been his plan and begs Clayton to kill him to relieve him of his suffering. Clayton refuses, puts Whale to bed, then sleeps downstairs. The next morning, Hanna is alarmed when she cannot find Whale, prompting a search by Clayton and Hanna. Clayton finds Whale floating dead in the pool as a distraught Hanna runs out, clutching a [[suicide note]]. Clayton and Hanna agree that he should disappear from the scene to avoid a scandal.\n\nA decade later, Clayton and his son, Michael, watch ''Bride of Frankenstein'' on television. Michael is skeptical of his father's claim that he knew Whale, but Clayton produces a sketch of the Frankenstein monster drawn by Whale, and signed, \"To Clayton. Friend?\". Clayton later walks down a street at night in the rain, miming the movements of Frankenstein's monster.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col begin}}\n* [[Ian McKellen]] as [[James Whale]]\n** [[Brandon Kleyla]] as young James Whale\n** Kent George as 25-year-old James Whale\n* [[Brendan Fraser]] as Clayton Boone\n* [[Lynn Redgrave]] as Hanna\n* [[Lolita Davidovich]] as Betty\n* [[David Dukes]] as [[David Lewis (producer)|David Lewis]]\n* [[Kevin J.
