''[[Box Office Mojo]]''. Retrieved 2011-02-27.</ref>\n}}\n\n'''''The Yards''''' is a 2000 American [[crime film]] directed by [[James Gray (director)|James Gray]], written by Gray and [[Matt Reeves]], and starring [[Mark Wahlberg]], [[Joaquin Phoenix]], [[Charlize Theron]] and [[James Caan (actor)|James Caan]].\n\nSet in the [[commuter rail]] yards in [[New York City]] (\"the yards\"), specifically in the boroughs of the [[Bronx]], [[Queens]], and [[Brooklyn]], where contractors repair railway cars for the city Transit Authority (TA), bribery, [[corporate crime]] and [[political corruption]] are commonplace, as rival companies sabotage each other's work to win bids, and the undercutting leads to murder.\n\n==Plot==\nLeo Handler rides the subway to his mother Val's house in [[Queens, New York]], where she throws a surprise party celebrating his parole. His cousin Erica Soltz is at the party with her boyfriend Willie, who takes Leo aside and thanks him for serving time in prison, implying that Leo had taken a fall for their gang of friends. Leo is eager to find a job to support his mother, as she has a heart condition. Willie suggests working for Erica's stepfather, Frank Olchin.\n\nThe next day, at the railway car repair company Frank owns, Leo is encouraged to enter a 2-year machinist program and Frank offers to help finance his studies. Needing work immediately, Leo asks about working with Willie for the company but Frank discourages that idea. Willie advises Leo not to worry about it, saying Frank also tried to get him into a machinist program.\n\nAt [[Brooklyn Borough Hall]], Willie explains how corrupt the contract system is for repair work on the subway. After a hearing to award contracts, Hector Gallardo approaches Willie about leaving Frank's firm for his. Willie brushes him off, taking Leo with him to [[Roosevelt Island]], where he bribes an official in charge of awarding contracts.\n\nOne night, Willie takes Leo to a rail yard, where he and a gang sabotage the work of Gallardo's firm in order to lower their quality rating and lessen their ability to get contracts. Leo is told to stand watch while the crew sabotages the train couplings. Willie heads into the yard master's office to pay him off with [[Knicks]] tickets, but is told to get his crew off the tracks, Gallardo having brought him $2,000 in cash. The yard master sounds the alarm, which draws a police officer. Terrified of returning to jail, Leo tries to run. When the cop begins to hit Leo with his night stick, Leo beats him into unconsciousness. As he runs off, he sees Willie kill the yard master.\n\nWith the cop in a coma at a hospital, the crew tells Leo that he must murder the officer to prevent him from identifying Leo when he awakens because if the cop lives, Leo will die. Upon awakening, the cop identifies Leo as his attacker, triggering a broad manhunt. The police assume Leo also killed the yard master. When they raid his mother's apartment, she has a heart attack, weakening her even further.\n\nDespite Willie's instructions to lay low, Leo emerges from hiding to visit his sick mother. Tending to her, Erica discovers Willie was with Leo at the yards and realizes Willie actually killed the yard master, consequently breaking up with him. Frank disowns Willie, who tries unsuccessfully to accept a deal offered to him earlier by Gallardo for protection.\n\nErica implores Frank to help, but instead Leo realizes that Frank is prepared to kill him. Out of options, Leo turns to Gallardo for protection. With Gallardo's lawyers beside him, Leo turns himself in at a public hearing into the rail yard incident and contract corruption. Realizing that the injured cop's testimony against Leo is in no one's interest, Frank and Gallardo negotiate a new split of the contracts with Queens Borough President Arthur Mydanick in a backroom deal.\n\nWillie goes to see Erica, trying to win her back. Frank has told him that Erica and Leo had been in love when they were younger, and once were caught having sex. Fearing his temper and jealousy, Erica triggers the silent house alarm. Willie tries to embrace her, but as she pulls away, he accidentally throws Erica off the second floor landing, sending her falling to her death. Outside the house, he surrenders to the police, who have responded to the alarm.\n\nPolice enter the hearing to inform Erica's mother Kitty and Frank of Erica's death.\n\nAfter Erica's funeral, Frank takes Leo aside to promise help in the future, if he stays quiet at a hearing by the Attorney General. Leo disgustedly turns away and joins the grieving Kitty and the rest of the family.\n\nLeo testifies against Frank and the others involved in the political corruption surrounding The Yards.\n\n(''Note'': A previous editor wrote that the director's cut excluded Leo testifying.){{Citation needed|date=February 2022}}\n\n==Cast==\n<!--- [[WP:NOTDATABASE]] - cast per closing tombstone stand-alone credits, order and roles per closing credits scroll --->\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Mark Wahlberg]] as Leo Handler\n* [[Joaquin Phoenix]] as Willie Gutierrez\n* [[Charlize Theron]] as Erica Soltz\n* [[James Caan]] as Frank Olchin\n* [[Ellen Burstyn]] as Val Handler\n* [[Faye Dunaway]] as Kitty Olchin\n* [[Steve Lawrence]] as Arthur Mydanick\n* [[Tony Musante]] as Seymour Korman\n* [[Victor Argo]] as Paul Lazarides\n* [[Tomas Milian]] as Manuel Sequiera\n* [[Robert Montano]] as Hector Gallardo\n* [[Victor Arnold (American actor)|Victor Arnold]] as Albert Granada\n* Joseph Ragno as Leo's parole officer \n}}\n\nIn addition, [[David Zayas]] appears as Officer Jerry Rifkin, while actual New York City based news anchors [[Roma Torre]], Lewis Dodley (as Louis Dodley)<ref>{{cite web |title=Lewis Dodley \u2014 Evening Anchor |date=2019-07-30 |work=[[NY1|Spectrum News NY1]] |url=https://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/on-air/2017/09/15/lewis-dodley |access-date=2022-02-21 |url-status=live |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20220127113441/https://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/on-air/2017/09/15/lewis-dodley |archive-date=2022-01-27}}</ref> and [[Ernie Anastos]] play news anchors seen reporting on incidents in the film.\n\n==Production==\nThe film's director and co-screenwriter, [[James Gray (director)|James Gray]], based the film on an actual corruption scandal in the mid-1980s, which involved his father.\n\nThe [[New York City Transit Authority]], known as the MTA, initially disallowed the production companies from filming at any of its yards because it believed the film negatively portrayed the agency.\n\nFilming locations included [[Roosevelt Island]], [[Maspeth, Queens|Maspeth]] and [[Elmhurst, Queens]], [[the Bronx]], and [[New Jersey]].
