Eastwood's character is the sole active-duty Secret Service agent who is still remaining from the detail that had guarded [[John F. Kennedy]] in [[Dallas]], [[Texas]], at the time of his [[John F. Kennedy assassination|assassination]] in 1963. The film also stars [[Dylan McDermott]], [[Gary Cole]], [[John Mahoney]], and [[Fred Thompson|Fred Dalton Thompson]].\n\n''In the Line of Fire'' was co-produced by [[Columbia Pictures]] and [[Castle Rock Entertainment]], with Columbia handling distribution. The film was a critical and commercial success. It grossed $187 million against a $40 million production budget and earned three nominations at the [[66th Academy Awards]].\n\n==Plot==\nFrank Horrigan and Al D'Andrea meet with members of a counterfeiting group at a marina. The group's leader, Mendoza, tells Horrigan that he has identified D'Andrea as an undercover [[United States Secret Service]] agent, and forces him to prove his loyalty by putting a gun to D'Andrea's head and pulling the trigger. When the gun just clicks, Mendoza is glad to see Frank passed the test, escaping suspicion. Using his own gun, Horrigan then shoots and kills Mendoza's men, identifies himself as Secret Service, and arrests Mendoza.\n\nHorrigan investigates a complaint from a landlady about an apartment's absent tenant, Joseph McCrawley. He finds a collage of photographs and newspaper articles on famous assassinations, a model-building magazine, and a ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' cover with the President's head circled. When Horrigan and D'Andrea return with a search warrant, only one photograph remains, which shows a much younger Horrigan standing behind [[John F. Kennedy]] in [[Dallas]] in 1963, on the day [[Assassination of John F. Kennedy|Kennedy was assassinated]]. Horrigan is the only remaining active agent who was guarding the President that day, and is wracked with guilt over his failure to react quickly enough to the first shot and shield Kennedy from the subsequent fatal bullet, which could have saved the President's life. The guilt drove Horrigan to drink excessively, and his family left him.\n\nHorrigan receives a phone call from McCrawley, who calls himself \"Booth\". He tells Horrigan that, like [[John Wilkes Booth]] and [[Lee Harvey Oswald]], he plans to kill the [[President of the United States]], who is running for reelection and is making many public appearances around the country. Horrigan, despite his age, asks to return to the [[Presidential Protective Division]], where he begins a relationship with fellow agent Lilly Raines.\n\nBooth continues to call Horrigan as part of his \"game\", even though he knows that his calls are being traced. He mocks Horrigan's failure to protect Kennedy but calls him a \"friend\". Booth escapes Horrigan and D'Andrea after one such call from [[Lafayette Square (Washington, D.C.)|Lafayette Park]], but inadvertently leaves a palm print on a passing car. The [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] matches the print, but because the person's identity is classified, the agency cannot disclose it to the Secret Service. The FBI does notify the [[Central Intelligence Agency]].\n\nAt a campaign event in [[Chicago]], Booth pops a decorative balloon. Horrigan, who is groggy with the flu, mistakes the pop for a gunshot and over-reacts. Because of the error, he is removed from the protective detail by [[White House Chief of Staff]] Harry Sargent and head of security detail Bill Watts, but retains the Booth case. Horrigan and D'Andrea follow a lead from the model-building magazine to a Phoenix home belonging to Mitch Leary; upon entering, the two agents subdue an unknown individual, revealed to be a CIA agent working with Leary's associate. The CIA reveals that Leary is a former agency assassin who has suffered a mental breakdown and is now a \"predator\" seeking revenge on his former masters. Leary, who has already killed several people as he prepares for the assassination, uses his model-making skills to mold a [[Improvised firearm|zip gun]] out of [[composite material]] to evade metal detectors.\n\nD'Andrea confides to Horrigan that he is going to retire immediately because of nightmares about the Mendoza incident, but Horrigan dissuades him from doing so. After Leary taunts Horrigan about the President facing danger in California, Horrigan and D' Andrea chase him across Washington rooftops, where Leary shoots and kills D'Andrea but saves Horrigan from falling to his death as he clings to the side of the building. Horrigan asks Raines to reassign him to the protective detail when the President visits Los Angeles, but a television crew films him mistaking a bellboy at the hotel for a security threat, pinning him against the wall, and Watts and Sargent again force Horrigan to leave the detail.\n\nHorrigan connects Leary to a bank employee's murder and determines that Leary, who has made several large campaign contributions, is among the guests at a campaign dinner at the hotel. He sees the President approaching Leary and jumps into the path of the assassin's bullet, saving the President's life. As the Secret Service quickly removes the President, Leary uses Horrigan\u2014who is wearing a bulletproof vest\u2014as a hostage to escape to the hotel's external elevator. Horrigan uses his earpiece to tell Raines and sharpshooters where to aim; although they miss Leary, Horrigan defeats him, leaving him hanging from the edge. Though Horrigan attempts to save him, Leary commits suicide by letting go and falling to his death.\n\nHorrigan, now a hero, retires, as his fame makes it impossible for him to do his job. He and Raines find a farewell message from Leary on Horrigan's answering machine. Horrigan and Raines visit the [[Lincoln Memorial]], the site of the first time they had gotten together off-duty.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Clint Eastwood]] as Secret Service Agent Frank Horrigan\n* [[John Malkovich]] as Mitch Leary / James Carney / Booth\n* [[Rene Russo]] as Secret Service Agent Lilly Raines\n* [[Dylan McDermott]] as Secret Service Agent Al D'Andrea\n* [[Gary Cole]] as Secret Service Agent Bill Watts\n* [[Fred Thompson|Fred Dalton Thompson]] as White House Chief of Staff Harry Sargent\n* [[John Mahoney]] as Secret Service Director Sam Campagna\n* [[Gregory Alan Williams]] as Secret Service Matt Wilder\n* Jim Curley as The President / Traveller\n* Sally Hughes as The First Lady\n* [[Tobin Bell]] as Marty Mendoza\n* [[William G.

He had planned on making a movie about a Secret Service Agent on detail during the Kennedy assassination since his boyhood. Apple was inspired and intrigued by a vivid early childhood memory of meeting Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson in person, surrounded by Secret Service Agents with earpieces in dark suits and sunglasses. The concept later struck Apple as an adolescent watching televised replays of the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. In 1991, writer Jeff Maguire came aboard and completed the script that would become the movie.<ref name=\"Turan\">{{cite news |date=July 9, 1993 |last=Turan |first=Kenneth |author-link=Kenneth Turan |title='Fire' lines up a worthy villain for Clint |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1993-07-09-ca-12845-story.html |access-date=February 23, 2021 }}</ref> In April, 1992, Castle Rock bought the script for $1.4 million.<ref name=\"Eller\">{{cite web |date=13 July 1993 |author=Claudia Eller |title='In the Line of Fire': Whose Movie Is It, Anyway? : Movies: Columbia Pictures bankrolled the Castle Rock production, but there is disagreement over just how much creative credit the studio can claim. |url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1993-07-13-ca-12681-story.html |website=[[Los Angeles Times]] }}</ref>\n\nEastwood and Petersen offered the role of Leary to [[Robert De Niro]], who turned it down due to scheduling conflicts with ''[[A Bronx Tale]]''.<ref>{{cite web |last=Crocker |first=John |title=MOVIE FEATURE: 10 THINGS YOU DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT...
