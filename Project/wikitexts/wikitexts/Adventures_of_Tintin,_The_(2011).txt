Filming was due to begin in October 2008 for a 2010 release, but the release was delayed to 2011 after [[Universal Pictures]] backed out of producing the film with [[Paramount Pictures]], which had provided $30 million in pre-production; [[Columbia Pictures]] replaced Universal as co-financer.

After Tintin takes the model home to his apartment, it gets accidentally broken during a chase between Snowy and a cat. A parchment scroll then slips out and rolls under a piece of furniture. Meanwhile, bumbling police detectives [[Thomson and Thompson]] are on the trail of a [[pickpocket]] named [[Aristides Silk]].\n\nAfter visiting Maritime Library to uncover the history surrounding the ''Unicorn'', Tintin returns to find the ''Unicorn'' has been stolen, suspecting Sakharine. He heads to [[Marlinspike Hall]] and accuses him of the theft, but noticing Sakharine's model is not broken he realizes there are two ''Unicorn'' models. Tintin then returns home to his apartment to find it ransacked. Snowy shows him the scroll, but they are interrupted by the arrival of Barnaby, who is then assassinated while attempting to recover the ''Unicorn''. Tintin places the scroll in his wallet, but is pickpocketed by Silk the next morning.\n\nLater, Tintin is abducted and imprisoned by accomplices of Sakharine on the SS ''Karaboudjan''. He learns that Sakharine formed an alliance with the ship's staff and led a [[mutiny]] to take control. On board, Tintin meets [[Captain Haddock|Archibald Haddock]], the ship's captain who is permanently drunk and unaware of most of his past. Tintin, Haddock and Snowy eventually outrun the crew and escape from the ''Karaboudjan'' in a lifeboat. The ship fails to ram their boat because they instead rammed an empty lifeboat the captain accidentally released during his escape. Presuming them to have survived by the number of lifeboats, Sakharine sends a [[seaplane]] to find and capture them. Feeling cold and thirsty on the lifeboat ride, Haddock foolishly uses a stowaway bottle of [[scotch whisky]] to light a fire in the boat, accidentally causing a massive explosion that flips the boat upside down and leaves the trio stranded on top of it. The trio seizes the plane, and uses it to fly towards the fictitious [[French protectorate in Morocco|Moroccan]] port of [[Settings in The Adventures of Tintin|Bagghar]]. However, the seaplane crashes in a desert due to low fuel and a thunderstorm.\n\nWhile trekking through the desert, Haddock hallucinates and remembers his ancestor, [[Sir Francis Haddock]], the 17th-century captain of the ''Unicorn'' whose treasure-laden ship was attacked by the crew of a pirate ship, led by [[Red Rackham]], later revealed to be Sakharine's ancestor. Sir Francis surrendered and eventually sank the ''Unicorn'' and most of the treasure, to prevent it from falling into Rackham's hands. The story implies there were three ''Unicorn'' models, each containing a scroll; together, the scrolls can reveal coordinates of the location of the sunken ''Unicorn'' and its treasure.\n\nThe third model is in Bagghar, possessed by [[Omar ben Salaad]]. Sakharine causes a distraction in a [[Bianca Castafiore]] concert that results in him stealing the third scroll. A chase through the city ensues during which he gains all the scrolls. Just as he is ready to give up, Tintin is persuaded by Haddock to continue. With help from Thomson and Thompson, Tintin and Haddock track Sakharine back to Brussels and set up a trap, but Sakharine uses his pistol to resist arrest. When his men fail to save him, Sakharine challenges Haddock to a sword fight with the cranes at the dock. After the fight, Sakharine is pushed overboard by Haddock and then finally rescued and arrested by Thomson and Thompson.\n\nGuided by the three scrolls which indicate the location of Marlinspike Hall, Tintin, Haddock and Snowy find there some of the treasure and a clue to the ''Unicorn''{{'}}s location. The film ends with both men agreeing on setting up an expedition to find the shipwreck.\n\n== Voice cast ==\n* [[Jamie Bell]] as [[Tintin (character)|Tintin]].<ref name=\"pr\">{{cite news |title=Paramount Pictures and Sony Pictures Entertainment Announce the January 26 Start of Principal Photography on the 3D Motion Capture Feature 'The Adventures of Tintin: Secret of the Unicorn' Directed by Steven Spielberg and Starring Jamie Bell and Daniel Craig |publisher=[[PR Newswire]] |url=http://news.prnewswire.com/ViewContent.aspx?ACCT=109&STORY=/www/story/01-26-2009/0004960578&EDATE= |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090201055406/http://news.prnewswire.com/ViewContent.aspx?ACCT=109&STORY=%2Fwww%2Fstory%2F01-26-2009%2F0004960578&EDATE= |url-status=dead |archive-date=1 February 2009 |access-date=26 January 2009 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Bell replaced [[Thomas Brodie-Sangster]], who dropped out when filming was delayed in October 2008.<ref name=\"delay\" /> Jackson suggested Bell to take on the role after previously casting him as Jimmy in his ''[[King Kong (2005 film)|King Kong]]'' remake.<ref name=\"dig\" />\n* [[Andy Serkis]] as [[Captain Haddock|Captain Archibald Haddock]] and [[List of The Adventures of Tintin characters#Sir Francis Haddock|Sir Francis Haddock]].<ref name=\"interpol\">{{cite news|author=Jay A.

In the book, Ivan Sakharine is a minor character, neither a villain nor the descendant of Red Rackham. As Sakharine was made the main antagonist in the film, the book's main villains, the [[Bird brothers]], are absent from the adaptation, save for a small \"cameo\" in the initial sequence at the market. As a result of this change, many events transpire that bear no relation to events in the books involving Sakharine's character.<ref name=\"Guardian_18Oct2011\">{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2011/oct/18/how-could-do-this-tintin/|title=How could they do this to Tintin?|work=The Guardian|date=18 October 2011|access-date=1 February 2015|archive-date=24 April 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150424154524/http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2011/oct/18/how-could-do-this-tintin|url-status=live}}</ref> As in other adaptations, Snowy's \"voice\" is not used.\n\n== Release ==\n[[File:Spielberg and Tintin 2011.jpg|thumb|[[Steven Spielberg]] and a costumed character of Tintin at the film's [[premiere]] in Paris, 22 October 2011.]]\nThe film's first press-screening was held in Belgium on 10 October 2011.<ref name=\"la libre\">{{cite web|title=Les Aventuriers de la Licorne Perdue|url=https://www.lalibre.be/culture/cinema/les-aventuriers-de-la-licorne-perdue-51b8dc3ce4b0de6db9c3950c|publisher=La Libre|access-date=12 October 2011|language=fr|date=12 October 2011|archive-date=19 August 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140819201503/http://www.lalibre.be/culture/cinema/les-aventuriers-de-la-licorne-perdue-51b8dc3ce4b0de6db9c3950c|url-status=live}}</ref> The world premi\u00e8re was held in Brussels, Belgium on 22 October 2011\u2014attended by [[Princess Astrid of Belgium, Archduchess of Austria-Este|Princess Astrid]] and her younger daughters, [[Princess Luisa Maria of Belgium, Archduchess of Austria-Este|Princess Luisa Maria]] and [[Princess Laetitia Maria of Belgium, Archduchess of Austria-Este|Princess Laetitia Maria]], with the Paris premi\u00e8re later the same day.<ref name=\"DT\">{{cite news|title=Tintin fans flock to Belgian film premiere|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/film-news/8844394/Tintin-fans-flock-to-Belgian-film-premiere.html|publisher=Daily Telegraph|access-date=31 October 2011|date=22 October 2011|location=London|archive-date=27 October 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111027062708/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/film-news/8844394/Tintin-fans-flock-to-Belgian-film-premiere.html|url-status=dead}}</ref> Sony later released the film during late October and early November 2011 in Europe, Latin America and India.

Dargis noted that Tintin's appearance in the film \"resembled Herg\u00e9's creation, yet was eerily different as if, like [[Pinocchio]], his transformation into human form had been prematurely interrupted\". Another major fault in the film, Dargis opines, is how it is overworked; she writes that there is \"hardly a moment of downtime, a chance to catch your breath or contemplate the tension between the animated Expressionism and the photo-realist flourishes\".
