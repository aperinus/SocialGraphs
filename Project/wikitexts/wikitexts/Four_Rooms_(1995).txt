The story is set in the fictional Hotel Mon Signor in [[Los Angeles]] on [[New Year's Eve]]. [[Tim Roth]] plays Ted, the [[bellhop]] and main character in the [[frame story]], whose first night on the job consists of four very different encounters with various hotel guests. \n\nThe film received mixed reviews from critics who praised the segments directed by Rodriguez and Tarantino, but heavily criticized the segments by Anders and Rockwell.\n\n==Plot==\nOn [[New Year's Eve]], [[bellhop]] Sam ([[Marc Lawrence]]) of the Hotel Mon Signor briefs his replacement, Ted ([[Tim Roth]]).\n\nThe film's animated [[opening credits]], inspired by the cartoons of ''[[The Pink Panther Show]]'', feature the [[scat singing|scat]] song \"[[Vertigogo]]\" by Combustible Edison.\n\n===Honeymoon Suite \u2013 \"The Missing Ingredient\"===\n*Written and directed by [[Allison Anders]]\nTed assists a group of unusual women with their luggage, which he brings to the Honeymoon Suite. He learns they are a [[coven]] of witches, attempting to reverse a spell cast on their goddess, [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]] ([[Amanda De Cadenet]]). The ritual requires them each to place an ingredient into a large cauldron; however, one ([[Ione Skye]]) has still to retrieve her ingredient \u2013 [[semen]] \u2013 with one hour left. She seduces Ted and they have sex in the cauldron. He leaves and they complete the ritual, and Diana emerges from the cauldron.\n\nAfter Ted's service in the honeymoon suite, a party guest from another room ([[Lawrence Bender]]) calls the front desk for some ice. He is unsure which floor he is on, but eventually directs Ted to Room 404.\n\n===Room 404 \u2013 \"The Wrong Man\"===\n*Written and directed by [[Alexandre Rockwell]]\nAt Room 404, Ted finds himself in a fantasy hostage situation. Sigfried ([[David Proval]]) maniacally accuses Ted, whom he calls Theodore, of having slept with his wife Angela ([[Jennifer Beals]]). Ted is forced at gunpoint to participate in the scenario, uncertain what is real. He becomes stuck in the bathroom window as the party guest appears in the window above, uttering the word \"ice\" and vomiting. Ted escapes, just as another guest (Paul Skemp) arrives, looking for Room 404, and is greeted by Sigfried in the same manner.\n\n===Room 309 \u2013 \"The Misbehavers\"===\n*Written and directed by [[Robert Rodriguez]] \nA husband ([[Antonio Banderas]]) and wife ([[Tamlyn Tomita]]) leave for a New Year's Eve party, tipping Ted $500 to keep an eye on their children, Sarah and Juancho (Lana McKissack and Danny Verduzco). Ted instructs the children to stay in their room; when he leaves, they vandalize the room, exploding a bottle of [[Champagne (wine)|champagne]]. They call Ted for toothbrushes, and he tries unsuccessfully to put them to bed. He leaves but is summoned back to find the room in further chaos: a painting has been turned into a dartboard with lipstick and a syringe, Juancho has a cigarette, Sarah has a bottle of liquor, the television is set to an [[Pornography|adult channel]], and the children have found a dead prostitute ([[Patricia Vonne]]) in the box spring. Sarah stabs Ted in the leg with the syringe when he repeatedly uses the word \"whore\" and Juancho accidentally sets the room on fire. Their father returns, carrying his passed-out wife, and asks Ted, \"Did they misbehave?\" The [[Fire sprinkler system|sprinkler system]] activates while everyone stands still.\n\nUnsettled, Ted calls his boss Betty ([[Kathy Griffin]]) to quit. After a conversation with Margaret ([[Marisa Tomei]]), he gets Betty on the phone and tries to quit, but receives a call from the hotel penthouse. Betty convinces him to stay and tend to the guests.\n\n===Penthouse \u2013 \"The Man from Hollywood\"===\n*Written and directed by [[Quentin Tarantino]], adapted from \"[[Man from the South]]\" by [[Roald Dahl]]\n\nThe penthouse is occupied by famous director Chester Rush (Tarantino) and his friends, including Angela. They request a block of wood, three nails, a ball of twine, a bucket of ice, a doughnut for Chester, a club sandwich for Angela, and a hatchet \"as sharp as the Devil himself\". Ted is invited to join their challenge: Chester's friend Norman ([[Paul Calder\u00f3n]]) has bet he can light his [[Zippo]] cigarette lighter ten times in a row; if Norman succeeds, he will win Chester's car, but if he fails, his pinky will be cut off. Ted, asked to \"wield the hatchet\" should Norman fail, tries to leave, but Chester offers $100 to hear them out and another $900 to perform this assigned role. Norman's lighter fails on the first try, and Ted immediately chops off his pinky, sweeps up the money, and leaves the penthouse with an energetic step. As the credits roll, Chester and company frantically prepare to take a screaming Norman to the hospital.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Tim Roth]] as Ted\n*[[Marc Lawrence]] as Sam\n\n===\"The Missing Ingredient\"===\n*[[Sammi Davis]] as Jezebel\n*[[Amanda de Cadenet]] as [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]]\n*[[Valeria Golino]] as Athena\n*[[Madonna]] as Elspeth\n*[[Ione Skye]] as Eva\n*[[Lili Taylor]] as Raven\n*[[Alicia Witt]] as Kiva\n\n===\"The Wrong Man\"===\n*[[David Proval]] as Siegfried\n*[[Jennifer Beals]] as Angela\n*[[Lawrence Bender]] as Long Hair Yuppie Scum\n*Paul Skemp as Real Theodore\n*Quinn Thomas Hellerman as Baby Bellhop\n\n===\"The Misbehavers\"===\n*[[Antonio Banderas]] as Husband\n*[[Tamlyn Tomita]] as Wife\n*[[Lana McKissack]] as Sarah\n*Danny Verduzco as Juancho\n*[[Patricia Vonne]] as Corpse\n*[[Salma Hayek]] as TV Dancing Girl\n\n===Betty's house===\n*[[Kathy Griffin]] as Betty\n*[[Marisa Tomei]] as Margaret\n*Julie McClean as Left Redhead\n*Laura Rush as Right Redhead\n\n===\"The Man from Hollywood\"===\n*[[Quentin Tarantino]] as Chester Rush\n*[[Jennifer Beals]] as Angela\n*[[Paul Calder\u00f3n]] as Norman\n*[[Bruce Willis]] as Leo (uncredited)\n*Kimberly Blair as Hooker (uncredited)\n\n==Crossovers between rooms==\nThe four segments are shown chronologically, except for \"The Misbehavers\", the events of which both precede and succeed the events of \"The Wrong Man\".\n\nThere are some connections between the four segments:\n*In \"The Wrong Man\", Ted recalls the witches' ritual in \"The Missing Ingredient\" with the expression \"weird voodoo thing\".\n*Ted can be seen with the two cherries from \"The Missing Ingredient\" at the beginning of \"The Misbehavers\".\n*Sarah in \"The Misbehavers\" calls a random room to ask a question. The man who picks up happens to be Siegfried from \"The Wrong Man\".\n*Angela appears in both \"The Wrong Man\" and \"The Man from Hollywood\".\n*When calling his boss, just before the beginning of \"The Man from Hollywood\", Ted recalls the events of the first three segments.\n\n==Production==\nMiramax presold Japanese distribution rights to [[Shochiku]] along with  [[Gary Fleder]]\u2019s ''[[Things to Do in Denver When You're Dead|Things to Do in Denver When You\u2019re Dead]]'', [[George T.
