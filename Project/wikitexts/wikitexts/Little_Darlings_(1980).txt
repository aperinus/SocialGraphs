The film was marketed with the tagline \"Don't let the title fool you\", a reference to a scene in which Randy comments on Angel's name, to which Angel replies, \"Don't let the name fool you.\"\n\nFilm critic [[Roger Ebert]] said of the film that it \"somehow does succeed in treating the awesome and scary subject of sexual initiation with some of the dignity it deserves.\"<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web |last=Ebert |first=Roger |author-link=Roger Ebert |date=25 March 1980 |title=Little Darlings |url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/little-darlings-1980 |url-status=live |access-date=2021-12-17 |website=Rogerebert.com}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nA group of teenage girls from [[Atlanta]] go to summer camp, and, unbeknownst to the adults, two of them make a bet as to which one will lose her virginity first, with all the girls in camp betting money on the contest. The girls involved in the contest are opposites and rivals: cynical, suspicious and streetwise poor girl Angel Bright and naive, prissy and romantic rich girl Ferris Whitney. The rest of the girls divide into two \"teams\", each rooting for and egging on either Ferris or Angel.  The two girls then choose guys they want to lose their virginity with. Angel targets Randy, a boy from the camp across the lake, and Ferris attempts to seduce Gary Callahan, the (much older) camp counselor.\n\nThe girls also engage in typical teenage camp behavior, like food fights and singing around a campfire. Both girls discover that sex is not what they thought it would be. Ferris thinks of sex as love and romance and wine and flowers and poetry.  She imagines herself swept off her feet by Gary.  When she lies about \"making love\" with him, Gary gets in trouble for having sex with a fifteen-year-old. She discovers that physical sex can have ugly consequences.  Her attitude is now more grounded in reality; she has become more like street-wise Angel.\n\nMeanwhile, street-wise Angel approaches the same issue from the other side and learns the opposite lesson. She views winning the contest as a purely biological act, \"no big deal\" and \"nothing,\" as her mother told her. But when she tries to do \"it\" with Randy in a boathouse, she becomes confused by scary feelings she did not know she had. She behaves defensively, like she doesn't want it. Randy, now also confused, is put off by her recalcitrance and leaves.\n\nAngel sees that sex is more than just a mechanical function she can cynically turn on and off. It involves feelings and caring and love. Sex is important, and something she deeply wants. As Randy leaves, she tearfully protests, \"But I ''like'' you!\"\n\nShe meets Randy a few days later with a much improved attitude\u2014one closer to Ferris's.  This time she pays attention, not to condoms and clothing, but to Randy and her feelings about him. As the novel adapted from the film's screenplay describes it, \"All her fear and resistance melted as they kissed. Soon, she didn't know who was touching whom, only that it was wonderful and right and fine.\"<ref>{{cite book |last1=Pilcer |first1=Sonia |title=Little Darlings |date=1980 |publisher=Ballantine Books |isbn=978-0345288943}}</ref>\n\nAngel has sex (offscreen) with Randy in the boathouse, but she doesn't tell the other girls. Ferris remains a virgin and lies about an evening of romantic passion (\"We had chilled Chablis; the darkness enveloped us.\").\n\nIn the end, Ferris discovers that sex is not just a fantasy of poetry and flowers and moonlight or something from a novel. The biological aspect is not necessarily romantic.  Angel discovers that biological sex involves powerful emotions that touch her deeply and transform her soul. Neither girl is quite ready for the emotional aspects that sex brings: When Randy seeks her out, Angel admits that while she likes him, and she is not ready for that kind of a relationship (he says they can start over, but Angel observes that it's too late and wouldn't be enough), while Ferris apologizes to Gary.  Together, the girls talk with the camp director and confess the situation, saving Gary's job.\n\nAngel and Ferris, the two outsiders, discover they are more alike than different, and as they return home to their parents, they become best friends.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Tatum O'Neal]] as Ferris Whitney\n* [[Kristy McNichol]] as Angel Bright\n* [[Armand Assante]] as Gary Callahan\n* [[Matt Dillon]] as Randy Adams\n* [[Maggie Blye]] as Ms. Bright\n* [[Nicolas Coster]] as Mr. Whitney\n* [[Marianne Gordon]] as Mrs. Whitney\n* [[Krista Errickson]] as Cinder Carlson\n* [[Alexa Kenin]] as Dana\n* Mary Betten as Miss Nichols\n* Abby Bluestone as Chubby\n* Troas Hayes as Diane\n* [[Cynthia Nixon]] as Sunshine Walker\n* Simone Schachter as Carrots\n* Jenn Thompson as Penelope Schubert\n\n==Production==\nThe film was made by Stephen Friedman's Kings Road Productions.
