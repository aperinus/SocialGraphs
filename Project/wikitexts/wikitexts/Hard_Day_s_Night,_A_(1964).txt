En route, they meet [[Paul McCartney]]'s trouble-making grandfather for the first time. The band play cards and entertain some schoolgirls before arriving at the London station, where they are quickly driven to a hotel and begin to feel cooped up. Their manager Norm tasks them with answering all their fan mail, but they sneak out to party, only to be caught by Norm and taken back. They then find out that Paul's grandfather went to a gambling club using an invitation sent to Ringo, and bring him back to the hotel.\n\nThe next day, the Beatles arrive at a TV studio for a performance. After the initial rehearsal, the producer assumes bad faith in them due to something Paul's grandfather said. After a mundane press conference, they leave through a fire escape and cavort in a field until forced off by the owner. Back in the studio, they are separated when a woman named Millie recognizes [[John Lennon]] but cannot recall who he is. [[George Harrison]] is lured into a trendmonger's office to audition for an advertisement with a popular female model. The band return to rehearse a second song and, after a quick trip to makeup, smoothly go through a third and earn a break.\n\nAn hour before the final run-through, [[Ringo Starr]] is forced to chaperone Paul's grandfather and takes him to the canteen for tea while he reads [[Anatomy of a Murder|a book]]. The grandfather manipulates Ringo into going outside to experience life rather than reading books, passing a surprised John and Paul on the way out. He tries to have a quiet drink in a pub, takes pictures, walks alongside the river and rides a bicycle along a railway station platform.{{Efn-la|This scene was filmed at {{rws|Crowcombe Heathfield}} on the [[West Somerset Railway]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.west-somerset-railway.co.uk/Crowcombe_Heathfield.html |title=Crowcombe Heathfield |access-date=3 April 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513171103/http://www.west-somerset-railway.co.uk/Crowcombe_Heathfield.html |archive-date=13 May 2008 |url-status=dead}}</ref>}} After nearly injuring a parrot and accidentally causing a woman to fall into a newly dug hole, Ringo is apprehended by a policeman as a troublemaker, and is joined by Paul's grandfather shortly after for attempting to sell Beatles photos with forged signatures. The grandfather runs back to the studio and tells the others about Ringo. Norm sends John, Paul and George to retrieve him. While doing so, the boys wind up in a [[Keystone Cops]]-style foot chase before arriving back at the studio with Ringo, with only minutes to spare before airtime. The televised concert goes on as planned, after which the Beatles are whisked away to another performance via helicopter.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{col-begin}}{{col-break}}\n* [[John Lennon]] as himself\n* [[Paul McCartney]] as himself\n* [[George Harrison]] as himself\n* [[Ringo Starr]] as himself\n* [[Wilfrid Brambell]] as John McCartney, Paul's grandfather\n* [[Norman Rossington]] as Norm, the Beatles' manager\n* [[John Junkin]] as Shake, the Beatles' road manager\n* [[Victor Spinetti]] as the TV director\n* [[Anna Quayle]] as Millie\n* [[Deryck Guyler]] as police sergeant\n* [[Richard Vernon]] as Johnson, the gentleman on the train\n* [[Edward Malin]] as the hotel waiter\n* [[Robin Ray]] as the TV floor manager\n* [[Lionel Blair]] as the TV choreographer\n* Alison Seebohm as Dolly, Simon Marshall's secretary\n* [[David Janson]] (as David Jaxon) as Charley, a young boy Ringo encounters\n{{col-break|gap=4em}}\n'''Uncredited:'''\n* [[Kenneth Haigh]] as Simon Marshall\n* [[Julian Holloway]] as Adrian, Simon's assistant\n* [[John Bluthal]] as a car thief\n* [[Michael Trubshawe]] as the casino manager\n* [[Margaret Nolan]] as the buxom girl at the casino\n* [[Pattie Boyd]] as Jean, a blonde schoolgirl on the train\n* Prudence Bury as Rita, a brunette schoolgirl on the train\n* [[Jeremy Lloyd]] as a nightclub dancer\n* [[Charlotte Rampling]] as a nightclub dancer\n* [[Phil Collins]] as a schoolboy watching the Beatles' TV performance\n* [[Marianne Stone]] as Society Reporter at theatre\n* [[Derek Nimmo]] as Leslie Jackson, the magician\n* Terry Hooper as casino croupier\n{{col-end}}\n\n== Songs ==\nThe film's credits incorrectly state that all songs are composed by [[Lennon\u2013McCartney|John Lennon and Paul McCartney]].

For instance, at one point a fan, played by [[Anna Quayle]], apparently recognises [[John Lennon]], though she does not actually mention Lennon's name, saying only \"you are...\". He demurs, saying his face is not quite right for \"him\", initiating a surreal dialogue ending with the fan, after she puts on her glasses, agreeing that Lennon doesn't \"look like him at all\", and Lennon saying to himself that \"she looks more like him than I do\".<ref name=\"HardDaysNightScript\" /> Other dialogue is derived from actual interviews with the Beatles.

Director Richard Lester said, \"The general aim of the film was to present what was apparently becoming a social phenomenon in this country.

The film was meant to be released in July 1964, and since it was already March when Lester got to filming, the entire film had to be produced over a period of sixteen weeks.

We'd almost finished making the film, and this fun bit arrived that we'd not known about before, which was naming the film. So we were sitting around at Twickenham studios having a little brain-storming session ... and we said, 'Well, there was something Ringo said the other day.'
