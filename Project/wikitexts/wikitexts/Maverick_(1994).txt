Based on the [[Maverick (TV series)|1957\u20131962 television series of the same name]] created by [[Roy Huggins]] and originally starring James Garner, the film stars Gibson as [[Maverick (TV series)#James Garner as Bret Maverick|Bret Maverick]], a [[card player]] and con artist who collects money in order to enter a high-stakes poker game. He is joined in his adventure by Annabelle Bransford (Foster), another con artist, and Marshal Zane Cooper (Garner), a lawman. The supporting cast features [[Graham Greene (actor)|Graham Greene]], [[James Coburn]], [[Alfred Molina]] and many cameo appearances by [[Western (genre)|Western]] film actors, country music stars and other actors.\n\nReleased theatrically by [[Warner Bros.]] on May 20, 1994, the film was both a critical and commercial success, having grossed over $183 million worldwide. It was nominated for an [[Academy Award for Best Costume Design]].\n\n==Plot==\nIn the [[American Old West]], gambler Bret Maverick is on his way to a major [[five-card draw]] [[poker tournament]] being held on the [[paddle steamer]] ''Lauren Belle''. Maverick wants to prove he is the best card player of his time. Short $3,000 of the $25,000 tournament entry fee, Maverick travels to the town of Crystal River, intending to make up the remainder by collecting debts and winning at poker. During one game, he encounters the ill-tempered gambler Angel, and the young con artist Annabelle Bransford. He wins a massive pot from Angel, but must flee without collecting his winnings.\n\nMaverick and Bransford share a stagecoach with Marshal Zane Cooper, and together the three set out of Crystal River. They narrowly escape a fatal plunge into a ravine after their elderly driver suddenly dies, and later aid a group of missionary settlers who have been robbed by bandits disguised as [[Native Americans in the United States|Indians]]. The settlers offer Maverick a percentage of the recovered money they desperately need to start their mission, while one spinster missionary suggests marriage to Cooper, but both men turn down their offers. The trio and the settlers are then suddenly cornered by a large band of real Indians whose leader, Joseph, is an old friend of Maverick; however, no one else in the group is aware of this fact. Maverick feigns sacrificing himself to allow the others to escape, then tries to collect the $1,000 that Joseph owes him. The two [[Fraud|swindle]] a [[Imperial Russia|Russian]] [[Archduke]] out of the needed amount with a scheme that \"allows\" him to hunt and kill an Indian (Maverick, in disguise).\n\nStill seething over his loss in the Crystal River game, Angel receives a telegram instructing him to stop Maverick. Angel and his mercenaries catch Maverick and try to hang him, but he escapes after they have departed. Still $2,000 short, he makes his way to the ''Lauren Belle'' and finds Bransford, who is still $4,000 short herself. Spotting the Archduke aboard, Maverick poses as a [[Bureau of Indian Affairs]] agent investigating the shooting of Indians for game, conning the Archduke out of $6,000 to cover his and Bransford's entry.\n\n[[Commodore (rank)|Commodore]] Duvall welcomes the competitors to the tournament, with Cooper overseeing the security of the game and the $500,000 prize money and watching for any cheaters, who are summarily thrown overboard when discovered. Eventually, only Maverick, Angel, Bransford, and Duvall are left to play the winner-take-all final game. During a break before this game, Maverick and Bransford have a [[Human sexual activity|tryst]] in his quarters. After Bransford leaves, Maverick finds he has been locked in to attempt to make him forfeit the game, but manages to climb outside the steamer to reach the table on time. After Bransford has been eliminated, but Maverick notices that the dealer is engaging in [[bottom dealing]] and has Angel give him the top card from the deck in order to prevent further cheating. All three men bet their remaining chips; Angel and Duvall reveal strong hands, but Maverick has received the one card he needs to complete a [[royal flush (poker hand)|royal flush]]. Angel and his men try to shoot and kill Maverick, but Cooper and Maverick shoot first, killing them.\n\nDuring the closing ceremony, Cooper steals the prize money and escapes instead of giving it to Maverick. Later that night, Cooper secretly meets with Duvall, revealing that the two had struck a deal to steal the money for themselves and that Angel was working for Duvall. As Duvall draws a gun and tries to break the deal, Maverick appears and takes back the money, having tracked them down. Some time Later, Cooper corners Maverick while the latter is enjoying a hot bath; the two are father and son and had planned this scheme long in advance. As both men relax in the baths, Bransford arrives, having discerned their relationship from their similar physiques and mannerisms. She takes the satchel containing the prize money and departs, after which Maverick reveals to Cooper that he had followed the latter's advice and hidden half of it in his boots. He muses that retrieving the stolen $250,000 will be fun.\n\n==Cast==\n<!--- Cast and order per tombstone opening credits, roles per closing credits scroll --->\n* [[Mel Gibson]] as [[Maverick (TV series)#James Garner as Bret Maverick|Bret Maverick]]\n* [[Jodie Foster]] as Annabelle Bransford\n* [[James Garner]] as Zane Cooper\n* [[Graham Greene (actor)|Graham Greene]] as Joseph\n* [[Alfred Molina]] as Angel\n* [[James Coburn]] as Commodore Duvall \n* [[Dub Taylor]] as Room Clerk\n* [[Dan Hedaya]] as Twitchy\n* [[Paul L.
