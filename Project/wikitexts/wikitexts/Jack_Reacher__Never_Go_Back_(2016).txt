A sequel to the 2012 film ''[[Jack Reacher (film)|Jack Reacher]]'', the film stars [[Tom Cruise]] and [[Cobie Smulders]], with supporting roles by [[Patrick Heusinger]], [[Aldis Hodge]], [[Danika Yarosh]], [[Holt McCallany]], and [[Robert Knepper]]. The plot follows Reacher going on the run with an Army major who has been framed for espionage, as the two reveal a dark conspiracy.\n\n[[Principal photography]] began on October 20, 2015, in [[New Orleans]], and the film was released on October 21, 2016, in [[IMAX]] and conventional formats.<ref>[http://www.imax.com/movies/jack-reacher-never-go-back Jack Reacher: Never Go Back - The IMAX Experience]</ref> It grossed $162 million worldwide and received mixed reviews from critics, who praised Cruise's performance and the film's action sequences, but criticized the plot.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://screenrant.com/tom-cruise-best-movies-of-the-decade-imdb/2/?v=6&n=f|title=Jack Reacher: Never Go Back - 6.1|date=2019-12-06|website=SCREENRANT |access-date=2019-12-06}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nAfter helping the 110th [[United States Army|US Army]] [[United States Army Criminal Investigation Division|CID]] [[Military Police Corps (United States)|Military Police]] arrest a corrupt Oklahoma County Sheriff Raymond Wood, local deputy and bust a [[human trafficking]] ring operating on US Army land, drifter and ex-US Army [[Military Police Corps (United States)|Military Police]] Investigator and  [[Major]], [[Jack Reacher]], returns to his old military headquarters in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington, DC]], to meet Major Susan Turner, holding his former command, with whom he has been working by phone during his travels. He learns from [[Colonel]] Sam Morgan that Turner has been accused of espionage and arrested.\n\nTurner's lawyer, Colonel Moorcroft, reveals that some evidence shows that Turner is involved in the murders of two US Army Military Police soldiers in [[Afghanistan]], but Reacher believes she is being framed. Moorcroft also reveals an old acquaintance of Reacher's, Candice Dutton, has filed a [[Paternity law|paternity suit]] against him, claiming he is the biological father of her 15-year-old daughter, Samantha. Reacher tries to reach out to Samantha, but she rebuffs him.\n\nMoorcroft is later killed by an ex-[[United States Special Operations Command|SOCOM]] operator-turned mercenary known as the Hunter, framing Reacher for the murder. Reacher is arrested by the Military Police and transported to the prison where Turner is being detained. When two hitmen arrive, Reacher neutralizes them, then escapes with Turner. They go to Morgan's house, having deduced he is involved in the conspiracy, and extract information. The Hunter, revealed to be working with Morgan, later kills Morgan and again frames Reacher.\n\nReacher and Turner uncover surveillance pictures of Samantha and surmise she is in danger, arriving at her home to find her foster parents killed and Samantha hiding. The three travel to Turner's old private school for protection, but discover that Samantha has her mobile phone with her, which the enemy has likely tracked. They make a quick exit, during which Samantha steals credit cards from one of the students.\n\nThe trio goes to New Orleans in search of Daniel Prudhomme, the only eyewitness to the murders for which Turner has been framed. En route, Reacher admits to Samantha he might be her father while Samantha reveals that she's the one who filed the paternity suit in order to gain financial support from him for her mother. Reacher and Turner find Prudhomme in a derelict warehouse filled with drug addicts, and learn that Prudhomme is connected to Parasource, a rogue [[Private military company|private military organization]] that is trying to cover up the murders. Reacher contacts Turner's friend, Captain Anthony Espin, to move Prudhomme into custody, but they are ambushed by Parasource operatives and Prudhomme is killed, while Reacher rescues a wounded Espin. Parasource's CEO, [[General officer|General]] James Harkness, sends the Hunter to capture Samantha after she uses a stolen credit card to purchase food.\n\nReacher, Turner, Espin and a team of Military Police officers, acting on information from Prudhomme, intercept a shipment of weapons due to enter the country, where they confront Harkness and his men, and accuse them of [[corruption]].  Espin finds [[Anti-tank warfare|antitank weapons]], though, as declared in the flight manifest. Before Turner can be rearrested, Reacher opens up one of the weapons and dumps out bags of pure [[opium]]. They learn that Harkness framed Turner, who had been investigating his activities, for the murders of the two Military Police soldiers who had discovered that Harkness was selling weapons to insurgents, then smuggling opium into the [[United States]]. Espin and his MPs arrest Harkness.\n\nThe Hunter and his men chase Samantha through the streets of New Orleans to lure Reacher into a confrontation. Turner kills one of the assassins, while Reacher takes out another one. The Hunter captures Samantha on a rooftop, but when Reacher arrives, she manages to escape. Reacher tackles the Hunter and they have a vicious fight, ending with Reacher breaking the Hunter's arm, leg, and neck, before dumping his body off the rooftop.\n\nFollowing Harkness' arrest, Turner is reinstated to her command. Reacher promises to keep in touch, then goes to meet Samantha at a diner. He tells Samantha he will recognize her mother, if he knows her, as he remembers every woman he has slept with. Samantha reveals that the waitress that had been serving him is, in fact, her mother, and that Reacher cannot be her father, as neither had recognized the other. Reacher and Samantha then reluctantly part.\n\nAs Reacher is walking along a road, he is surprised when a phone Samantha had slipped into his pocket rings. He finds a text message from her reading, \"Miss me yet?\". Reacher smiles as he sticks out his thumb to hitch a ride.\n\n==Cast==\n<!--- Cast and order per tombstone closing credits, plus two named in synopsis, roles per closing credits scroll --->\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Tom Cruise]] as Jack Reacher, a former [[U.S. Army]] Military Police Officer\n* [[Cobie Smulders]] as Major Susan Turner\n* [[Aldis Hodge]] as Captain Espin\n* [[Danika Yarosh]] as Samantha, Jack Reacher's assumed biological daughter\n* [[Jessica Stroup]] as Lieutenant  Sullivan\n* [[Patrick Heusinger]] as The Hunter\n* [[Holt McCallany]] as Colonel Sam Morgan\n* [[Robert Knepper]] as General James Harkness\n* Madalyn Horcher as Sergeant Leach\n* Robert Catrini as Colonel Moorcroft\n* Austin H\u00e9bert as Daniel Prudhomme\n* [[Jason Douglas]] as Sheriff Raymond Wood\n* Judd Lormand as Local deputy\n}}\n\nIn addition, Lee Child, author of the ''[[Jack Reacher (book series)|Jack Reacher]]'' novel series, makes a brief appearance as a [[Transportation Security Administration|TSA agent]].\n\n==Production==\nWhile ''Jack Reacher'' was intended to be a [[Tent-pole (entertainment)|tent-pole]] for a film series,  a sequel was initially reported to be unlikely due to its lackluster run at the North American box office.<ref>{{cite web|last=McClintock|first=Pamela|title=Tom Cruise's 'Jack Reacher' Unlikely to Get Sequel|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/tom-cruises-jack-reacher-sequel-412465|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|publisher=[[Prometheus Global Media]]|access-date=May 24, 2015|date=January 14, 2013}}</ref> In February 2013, a sequel became more likely after the film surpassed a gross of $200 million worldwide.<ref>{{cite web|last=Trumbore|first=Dave|title=JACK REACHER Sequel Possibly in the Works at Paramount and Skydance|url=https://collider.com/jack-reacher-sequel/|work=[[Collider (website)|Collider]]|access-date=May 24, 2015|date=February 22, 2013}}</ref> On December 9, 2013,  [[Paramount Pictures]] and [[Skydance Media]] announced they were moving forward with the development of a second film, reportedly based on the 2013 Jack Reacher novel ''Never Go Back''.<ref>{{cite web|last=Fleming|first=Mike Jr.|title=Jack Reacher\u2019s Back; Tom Cruise Developing New Bestseller \u2018Never Go Back\u2019|url=https://deadline.com/2013/12/jack-reachers-back-tom-cruise-developing-new-bestseller-never-go-back-649488/|work=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|publisher=[[Penske Media Corporation]]|access-date=May 24, 2015|date=December 9, 2013}}</ref>  On May 14, 2014, Tom Cruise was reported to be reprising his role as Jack Reacher.<ref>{{cite web|title=Jack Reacher 2 Movie To Bring Back \u2018Top Gun\u2019 Star Tom Cruise With A \u2018Teenage Female Sidekick\u2019 Based On Lee Child\u2019s Novel \u2018Never Go Back\u2019|url=http://www.kpopstarz.com/articles/91535/20140514/jack-reacher-2-movie.htm|work=KpopStarz|access-date=May 24, 2015|date=May 14, 2014}}</ref>\n\nOn May 19, 2015, ''Deadline'' reported that Edward Zwick would reteam with Cruise, and direct the film.
