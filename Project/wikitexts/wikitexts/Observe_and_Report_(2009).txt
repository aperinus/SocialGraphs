It was released on April 10, 2009 and grossed $27 million.\n\n==Plot==\nAn anonymous flasher [[Indecent exposure|exposes himself]] to shoppers in the Forest Ridge Mall parking lot. The head of mall security, Ronnie Barnhardt, makes it his mission to apprehend the offender. However, while Ronnie is ostensibly well-intentioned and valiant in his own mind, in reality he is emotionally unstable with [[vigilante]] tendencies, apparently experiencing [[bipolar disorder]] and displaying [[homicidal ideation|violent ideation]], among other problems.\n\nThe criminal activity at the mall continues as the flasher exposes himself to make-up counter worker Brandi and a masked robber causes property damage at a shoe store. In both instances, Detective Harrison, a police detective, arrives to investigate. The two dislike each other, as Ronnie believes Harrison is taking over his proper role as investigator and Harrison believes that Ronnie is disrupting the investigation.\n\nRonnie decides to take steps to become a police officer. As part of his preparations, Ronnie decides to ride along with Detective Harrison. Harrison tricks him into walking into the most dangerous part of town and drives off. Ronnie then confronts and subsequently assaults several drug dealers, victoriously returning to the police station with a dealer's son and thanking the detective for the opportunity to prove himself.\n\nEmboldened, Ronnie arranges a date with Brandi. On their date, she sees him taking a prescription [[clonazepam]] and assumes that Ronnie takes them [[Recreational drug use|recreationally]]. She asks him to share and he gives her the entire bottle, believing he does not need his prescription anymore. Ronnie takes her home and has sex with her while she is semi-conscious.\n\nRonnie passes the background check and physical examination for the police officer job, but fails the psychological examination. Nell, a friendly food court worker, tearfully shares that her coworker, Trina, and her boss, Roger, tease her for having her leg in a cast. Ronnie then beats up Roger and warns him and Trina not to harass Nell again. Depressed, he is persuaded by fellow security officer Dennis to spend the day doing a wide variety of drugs and assaulting [[skateboard]]ing teenagers. At the end of the day, Dennis reveals that he is the one who has been stealing from the mall. Ronnie insists this is wrong and, after a brief argument, Dennis knocks him unconscious and flees.\n\nRonnie decides to go [[undercover]] in order to catch the flasher, but when he catches Brandi having sex with Harrison in the parking lot, he confronts her in front of onlookers at the mall the next day, blowing his cover and destroying a display case. The police are summoned and Ronnie fights them off, defeating the regular officers, until he is overpowered by Harrison and arrested.\n\nA few days later, Ronnie's mother gives him a postcard from Dennis in Mexico, who respects Ronnie for caring so much. Ronnie returns to the mall, despondent that he no longer works security. He discovers that Nell's cast has been removed. She kisses him just before the flasher arrives and exposes himself to the food court.\n\nAfter a brief chase, Ronnie incapacitates the flasher by shooting him in the shoulder. As he picks the bleeding flasher up, Brandi thanks him, but he rejects and publicly humiliates her for sleeping with Harrison. Ronnie brings the flasher to the police station, gloating that he has won by apprehending him. Ronnie is subsequently interviewed by the local news, having regained his job and begun dating Nell.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Seth Rogen]] as Ronnie Barnhardt\n* [[Ray Liotta]] as Detective Harrison Jones\n* [[Collette Wolfe]] as Nell Jones\n* [[Anna Faris]] as Brandi Gaffney\n* [[Michael Pe\u00f1a]] as Dennis Chavante\n* [[Jesse Plemons]] as Charles Gaffney\n* [[Aziz Ansari]] as Saddamn\n* [[Dan Bakkedahl]] as Mark\n* [[John Yuan]] as John Yuen\n* [[Matthew Yuan]] as Matt Yuen\n* [[Celia Weston]] as Mrs. Barnhardt\n* [[Randy Gambill]] as Pervert\n* [[Patton Oswalt]] as Roger\n* [[Ben Best]] as Detective Okarski\n* [[Danny McBride]] as Caucasian Crackhead\n* [[Lauren Miller Rogen|Lauren Miller]] as Trina\n* Alston Brown as Bruce\n* Cody Midthunder as D-Rock\n\n==Production==\nThe film was shot on location in the largely abandoned [[Winrock Town Center|Winrock Shopping Center]] in [[Albuquerque, New Mexico|Albuquerque]], [[New Mexico]].<ref name=\"Observe and Report ReviewVariety Review\">[https://www.variety.com/review/VE1117939886.html?categoryid=31&cs=1] ''Observe and Report Review'' 18 Mar 2009.
