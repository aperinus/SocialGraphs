It is based on the life and writings of [[14th Dalai Lama|Tenzin Gyatso, the 14th Dalai Lama]], the exiled political and spiritual leader of [[Tibet]]. Tenzin Thuthob Tsarong, a grandnephew of the Dalai Lama, stars as the adult Dalai Lama, while Tencho Gyalpo, a niece of the Dalai Lama, appears as the Dalai Lama's mother.\n\n\"Kundun\" (\u0f66\u0f90\u0f74\u0f0b\u0f58\u0f51\u0f74\u0f53\u0f0b {{bo|w=sku mdun}} in [[Tibetan script|Tibetan]]), meaning \"presence\", is a title by which the [[Dalai Lama]] is addressed. ''Kundun'' was released only a few months after ''[[Seven Years in Tibet (1997 film)|Seven Years in Tibet]]'', sharing the latter's location and its depiction of the Dalai Lama at several stages of his youth, though ''Kundun'' covers a period three times longer. It is the final film to be released during Melissa Mathison's lifetime prior to her passing in 2015 months after she completed her final project, ''[[The BFG (2016 film)|The BFG]]'', which was posthumously released a year later.\n\n==Plot==\n\n[[File:Kundun3.jpg|upright|thumb|At the beginning of the film the two-year-old boy (Tenzin Yeshi Paichang) is visited at his rural birthplace in Amdo by the searching [[lama]]s and undertakes a test to confirm his identity as the \"Bodhisattva\".]]\nThe film has a linear chronology with events spanning from 1937 to 1959;<ref name=\"nyt\">[https://movies.nytimes.com/mem/movies/review.html?res=9C06E2D8123EF937A15751C1A961958260 December 24, 1997 Review] from ''[[The New York Times]]''</ref> the setting is [[Tibet]], except for brief sequences in China and India. It begins with the search for the 14th [[mindstream]] [[Nirm\u0101\u1e47ak\u0101ya|emanation]] of the [[Dalai Lama]]. After a [[vision (religion)|vision]] by [[Reting Rinpoche]] (the [[regent]] of Tibet) several lamas disguised as servants discover a promising candidate: a child born to a farming family in the province of [[Amdo]], near the Chinese border.\n\nThese and other [[lama]]s administer a test to the child in which he must select from various objects the ones that belonged to the previous Dalai Lama. The child passes the test, and he and his family are brought to [[Potala Palace]] in [[Lhasa]], where he will be installed as Dalai Lama when he [[Coming of age|comes of age]].\n\nDuring the journey, the child becomes homesick and frightened, but is comforted by Reting, who tells him the story of the first Dalai Lama\u2013whom the lamas called \"Kundun\". As the film progresses, the boy matures in both age and learning. After a brief power struggle in which Reting is imprisoned and dies, the Dalai Lama begins taking a more active role in governance and religious leadership.\n\nMeanwhile, the [[Chinese communists]], recently victorious in their revolution, are proclaiming Tibet a traditional part of [[History of China#Imperial China|Imperial China]] and express their desire to reincorporate it with the newly formed People's Republic of China. Eventually, despite Tibet's pleas to the United Nations, the United States, the United Kingdom, and India for intervention, Chinese Communist forces invade Tibet. The Chinese are initially helpful, but when the Tibetans resist Communist reorganization and reeducation of their society, the Chinese become oppressive.\n\nFollowing a series of atrocities suffered by his people, the Dalai Lama resolves to meet with [[Mao Zedong|Chairman Mao Zedong]] in Beijing. While Mao publicly expresses his sympathies to the Tibetan people and the Dalai Lama, and insists that changes must be made as the Dalai Lama sees fit, relations inevitably deteriorate. During their face-to-face meeting on the final day of the Dalai Lama's visit, Mao makes clear his view that \"religion is poison\" and that the Tibetans are \"poisoned and inferior\" because of it.\n\nUpon his return to Tibet, the Dalai Lama learns of more horrors perpetrated against his people, who have by now repudiated their [[Seventeen Point Agreement|treaty]] with China and begun [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla action]] against the Chinese. After the Chinese make clear their intention to kill him, the Dalai Lama is convinced by his family and his Lord Chamberlain to flee to India.\n\nAfter consulting the [[Nechung Oracle]] about the proper escape route, the Dalai Lama and his staff put on disguises and slip out of Lhasa under cover of darkness. During an arduous journey, throughout which they are pursued by the Chinese, the Dalai Lama becomes very ill and experiences two personal visions, first that their trip to India will be propitious and that, similarly, their eventual return to Tibet will also be propitious. The group eventually makes it to a small mountain pass on the Indian border. As the Dalai Lama walks to the guard post, an Indian [[Border guard|guard]] approaches him, salutes, and inquires: \"Are you the [[Gautama Buddha|Lord Buddha]]?\" The Dalai Lama replies with the film's final line: \"I think that I am a reflection, like the moon on water. When you see me, and I try to be a good man, you see yourself.\" Once the Dalai Lama arrives at his new residence, he unpacks his telescope and steps outside. Erecting it and removing his spectacles, he gazes through it toward the Himalayas\u2013and toward Tibet. The film concludes with two lines printed on screen: \"The Dalai Lama has not yet returned to Tibet. He hopes one day to make the journey.\" The words shimmer into a dissolve upon the black screen as the credits begin.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Kundun1.jpg|thumb|The Dalai Lama as portrayed in the film as a young man.]]\n[[File:Kundun2.jpg|upright|thumb|The young Dalai Lama as portrayed in the film.]]\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* Tenzin Thuthob Tsarong as the [[14th Dalai Lama|Dalai Lama]] (Adult)\n** Gyurme Tethong as the Dalai Lama (Age 12)\n** Tulku Jamyang Kunga Tenzin as the Dalai Lama (Age 5)\n** Tenzin Yeshi Paichang as the Dalai Lama (Age 2)\n* Tencho Gyalpo as [[Diki Tsering|Diki Tsering, the Dalai Lama's mother]]\n* Tenzin Topjar as Lobsang (age 5 to 10)\n* Tsewang Migyur Khangsar as the Dalai Lama's father\n* Tenzin Lodoe as [[Thubten Jigme Norbu|Takster Rinpoche, brother of the Dalai Lama]]\n* Tsering Lhamo as Tsering Dolma\n* Geshi Yeshi Gyatso as the Lama of Sera\n* Losang Gyatso as The Messenger (as Lobsang Gyatso)\n* Sonam Phuntsok as [[Jamphel Yeshe Gyaltsen|Jamphel Yeshe Gyaltsen, 5th Reting Rinpoche]]\n* Gyatso Lukhang as Lord Chamberlain\n* [[Lobsang Samten]] as Master of the Kitchen\n* Jigme Tsarong as Taktra Rinpoche (as Tsewang Jigme Tsarong)\n* Tenzin Trinley as [[Ling Rinpoche]]\n* Robert Lin as chairman [[Mao Zedong]]\n* Jurme Wangda as Prime Minister Lukhangwa\n* Jill Hsia as Little Girl\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\nThe project began when screenwriter [[Melissa Mathison]] met with the [[14th Dalai Lama|Dalai Lama]] and asked him if she could write about his life.
