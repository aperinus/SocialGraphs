It was directed by [[J. Lee Thompson]] and written by Norman Aladjem, Robert Gosnell and Jeffrey M. Rosenbaum. This was the first comedic role for Norris, giving him a chance to poke fun at his action persona.<ref name=\"HandsomeHokum\">{{cite news|title= 'Firewalker' Is Handsome Hokum |newspaper= [[The Los Angeles Times]]|date=1986-11-24|url= https://articles.latimes.com/1986-11-24/entertainment/ca-12881_1_chuck-norris|access-date=2010-08-30 | first=Kevin | last=Thomas}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nMax Donigan and Leo Porter are two \"seasoned\" [[treasure hunting|treasure hunters]] whose adventures rarely result in any notable success. After their latest stint gone wrong, they are recruited by a seemingly-psychic woman, Patricia Goodwin, owner of a treasure map. She convinces them that the map leads to a huge stockpile of gold belonging to the \"Firewalker.\" She then says that someone, or thing, else is searching for the map: a red [[cyclops]].\n\nThe map leads them to a cave on a local [[Native American Reservation]]. Patricia warns them that the cave is home to \"old people, sleeping\"; they later discover it is a mass grave filled with skeletons. They find a [[Spain|Spanish]] [[Conquistador]] [[helmet]] and [[mural]] depicting [[Aztec]] and [[Maya civilization|Mayan]] art, with an [[anachronistic]] date of 1527. As Leo studies the mural, Max finds a [[ruby]]-pommeled [[dagger]] hidden inside a skull. They are ambushed inside the cave by a small group of men and Patricia is taken by one of them. After killing their attackers, Max and Leo confront the [[kidnapper]]; upon seeing the dagger, he screams and throws himself into a pit.\n\nWhile discussing the nature of the dagger at a local bar, Max, Leo and Patricia hear from the barkeep about ''El Coyote'': a local that believes himself descended from the Aztecs \u2014and also happens to be a one-eyed man with an eye patch. The barkeep also directs them to Tall Eagle, a local [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]]. He tells them that the Firewalker was a powerful being that flew away to walk in the fires of the sun and gives Patricia a small bag of \"magic\" to protect her. While trying to figure out where to go next, Patricia stabs the dagger into a map, then faints, giving them a location of San Miguel. Max is later drugged by a woman; El Coyote chants while holding a snake as the woman attempts to murder Max. A chanting Tall Eagle causes Patricia to suddenly wake and rush to Max's defense; she and Leo stop the woman from succeeding. They capture her, but she disappears overnight and a snake appears in her cell.\n\nThey travel to San Miguel and barter for information. A man named Boggs directs them to a contact in a village named Chajal; Boggs is later seen to have been working for, and is killed by, El Coyote. Dressed as priests and a nun to avoid detection, the trio make it to Chajal and find it completely deserted. Local militia chase them into the jungle on foot; they escape and make camp for the night. They are found in the morning by a friend of Max's: Corky Taylor, leader of a small group of [[Central American]] freedom fighters, who provides them with a vehicle to finish their journey. When they stop that night, Leo disappears; Patricia and Max believe him dead when they find blood and his glasses by the [[alligator]]-infested river.\n\nThe next morning, Patricia and Max find the temple they have been searching for. Inside, they find Leo alive and dangling from a rope, along with El Coyote. He offers Leo in exchange for the dagger, claiming he has no use for the three of them. After suggesting that Patricia can go free, she leaves and is sealed in a passageway. El Coyote laughs and explains that he will kill them and sacrifice Patricia to appease the gods and become the Firewalker. Max throws the dagger at El Coyote to kill him, but he catches it and leaves the chamber. Max rescues Leo as El Coyote prepares to kill Patricia. They reach her just in time; Max shoots El Coyote in the chest, seemingly killing him. Patricia finds the gold by placing the dagger in a slot on the altar, opening a chamber below it. After gathering the gold, El Coyote attacks them. Patricia stabs him in the back with the dagger just as he prepares to kill Max. With El Coyote stunned, Max is able to fight back, kicking him onto the altar. Patricia then sprinkles the magic bag on El Coyote's body; he bursts into flame as they leave the temple with the gold and the trio reap the rewards of their successful journey.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Chuck Norris]] as Max Donigan\n* [[Louis Gossett Jr.]] as Leo Porter\n* [[Melody Anderson]] as Patricia Goodwin\n* [[Will Sampson]] as Tall Eagle\n* [[Sonny Landham]] as \"El Coyote\"\n* [[John Rhys-Davies]] as \"Corky\" Taylor\n* [[Ian Abercrombie]] as Boggs\n* Richard Lee-Sung as The General\n* [[Zaide Silvia Guti\u00e9rrez]] as Indian Girl\n* \u00c1lvaro Carca\u00f1o as Willie\n* John Hazelwood as Tubbs\n* Dale Payne as Pilot\n* Kevin Zinter as Co-Pilot\n* M\u00e1rio Ar\u00e9valo as Guerilla Leader\n* Miguel \u00c1ngel Fuentes as Big Man (as Miguel Fuentes)\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\nChuck Norris wanted to write a comedy and was recommended to writer Robert Gosnell.

But Norris had a seven year deal with Cannon and was their leading box office star along with [[Charles Bronson]]. \"Whether I do more lighter-type films beyond this one will be determined by how ''Firewalker'' does,\" said Norris. \"The audience tells you what you'll be doing or not doing.

He said the bottom line is if you get the best reviews in the world and the movie bombs, you're not going to get work. But if it's a huge success, whether the criticism is good or bad, you'll work.
