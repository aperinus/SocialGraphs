Reilly]], [[William H. Macy]], [[Philip Seymour Hoffman]], and [[Heather Graham]].\n\nThe film premiered at the [[1997 Toronto International Film Festival|Toronto International Film Festival]] on September 11, 1997, and was theatrically released on October 10, 1997, garnering critical acclaim. It was nominated for three [[Academy Awards]], including [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay|Best Original Screenplay]] for Anderson, [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]] for Moore, and [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Supporting Actor]] for Reynolds. The [[Boogie Nights (soundtrack)|film's soundtrack]] also received acclaim.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1977, high-school dropout Eddie Adams is living with his father and emotionally abusive mother in [[Torrance, California]]. He works at a [[Reseda, Los Angeles|Reseda]] nightclub owned by Maurice Rodriguez, where he meets [[Pornographic film|porn filmmaker]] Jack Horner. Interested in bringing Eddie into porn, Jack auditions him by watching him have sex with Rollergirl, a porn starlet who always wears skates.\n\nAfter a fight with his mother, Adams moves in with Horner at his [[San Fernando Valley]] home. Adams gives himself the [[Stage name|screen name]] \"Dirk Diggler\" and becomes a star because of his good looks, youthful charisma, and unusually large penis. His success allows him to buy a new house, an extensive wardrobe, and a \"competition orange\" [[Chevrolet Corvette (C3)|1977 Chevrolet Corvette]]. With his friend and co-star Reed Rothchild, Dirk pitches a series of successful [[action fiction|action]]-themed porn films. He works and socializes with others from the porn industry, and they live carefree lifestyles in the late 1970s [[disco]] era. While attending a [[New Year's Eve]] party at Horner's house on December 31, 1979, assistant director Little Bill Thompson discovers his adulterous wife having sex with another man. Bill, tired of being repeatedly [[cuckold]]ed, shoots the pair dead and commits suicide.\n\nDirk and Reed begin using [[cocaine]] on a regular basis. Due to his drug use, Dirk finds it increasingly difficult to achieve an [[erection]], falls into violent mood swings, and becomes irritated with Johnny Doe, a rival leading man Jack has recently recruited. Dirk worries that Johnny is displacing him. In 1983, after arguing with Jack, Dirk is fired and takes off with Reed to start a music career along with Scotty, a [[Boom operator (media)|boom operator]] who is in love with Dirk. Jack rejects business overtures from Floyd Gondolli, a theater magnate who insists on cutting costs by shooting on [[videotape]] because Jack believes that video will diminish the quality of his films.\n\nAfter his friend and financier, Colonel James, is incarcerated for causing an underage girl to overdose on cocaine, along with possession of [[child pornography]], Jack cooperates with Gondolli but becomes disillusioned with the work he is expected to churn out. One of these projects involves Jack and Rollergirl riding in a limousine, searching for random men for her to have sex with while being taped by a crew. After they pick up a man, he recognizes Rollergirl as a former high-school classmate. After a failed attempt at intercourse, he insults her and Jack. Both Jack and Rollergirl attack the man, leaving him bloodied on the sidewalk.\n\nLeading lady Amber Waves lands in a custody battle with her ex-husband. The court determines that she is an unfit mother due to her involvement in the porn industry, criminal record, and cocaine addiction. Buck Swope marries fellow porn star Jessie St. Vincent, who becomes pregnant. Because of his past as a pornographer, Buck is disqualified from a bank loan and cannot open his own stereo equipment store. That night, he finds himself in the middle of a holdup at a donut shop in which the clerk, the robber, and an armed customer are killed. Buck is the sole survivor and escapes with the money.\n\nHaving wasted their money on drugs, Dirk and Reed cannot pay a recording studio for demo tapes they believe will enable them to become music stars. Desperate for money, Dirk resorts to [[male prostitution|prostitution]] but is assaulted and robbed by three men. Dirk, Reed, and their friend Todd Parker attempt to scam local drug dealer Rahad Jackson by selling him a half-kilo of baking soda disguised as cocaine. Dirk and Reed want to leave quickly before Rahad's bodyguard inspects it, but Todd attempts to steal more drugs and money from Rahad. In the ensuing gunfight, Todd kills Rahad's bodyguard and is killed by Rahad, while Dirk and Reed narrowly escape. Dirk goes back to Jack's home and they reconcile.\n\nIn 1984, Jessie gives birth to her and Buck's son, Amber shoots the television commercial for the opening of Buck's store, Reed performs a magic act at a [[strip club]], Colonel James remains in prison, Maurice opens a nightclub, and Rollergirl takes a [[General Educational Development|GED]] class. Dirk and Amber prepare to start filming again.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast list|\n* [[Mark Wahlberg]] as Eddie Adams / Dirk Diggler\n* [[Julianne Moore]] as Maggie / Amber Waves\n* [[Burt Reynolds]] as Jack Horner\n* [[Don Cheadle]] as Buck Swope\n* [[John C.

Show-biz stories are all pretty much the same: ambition, stardom, drugs, disillusionment. Add the home video revolution to this mix and curiosity about the size of the boy wonder's equipment; throw in a few topical references like the soft drink [[Fresca]], and you have the bare bones of the story.\" He gave the film three and a half stars out of a possible four.<ref>{{cite web | last=Siskel | first=Gene | title='Boggie' Grooves to an Off Beat | website=chicagotribune.com | date=October 17, 1997 | url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1997-10-17-9710170183-story.html | access-date=December 29, 2020 | archive-date=August 9, 2020 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200809215220/https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1997-10-17-9710170183-story.html | url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n===Accolades===\n[[File:Red Bandit Jacket.jpg|thumb|upright|Reynolds received over ten accolades, including his only [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nomination and a nomination for a [[Screen Actors Guild Award]].
