It stars [[Kim Novak]] as a witch who casts a spell on her neighbor, played by [[James Stewart]]. The supporting cast features [[Jack Lemmon]], [[Ernie Kovacs]], [[Hermione Gingold]], [[Elsa Lanchester]], and [[Janice Rule]]. The film is considered Stewart's final role as a romantic lead.\n\n== Plot ==\n[[File:Bell, Book and Candle.jpg|thumb|right|300px|[[Kim Novak]] as Gillian]]\nGillian Holroyd is the owner of a rare African art store in [[Greenwich Village]], New York City, and secretly a witch. Bored with her routine life, she takes an interest in her new neighbor, publisher Shep Henderson. On [[Christmas Eve]], Shep arrives home to discover Gillian's aunt, Queenie, inside his apartment. Offended at being ushered out, Queenie \u2013 also a witch \u2013 casts a hex on Shep's telephone. He visits Gillian to use her phone, and they discuss the best-selling book ''Magic in Mexico'' and his desire to meet the author, Sidney Redlitch. As Shep leaves, Queenie invites them both to the Zodiac Club. Having perused his letters, Queenie reports that Shep is engaged, but encourages Gillian to use her magic to pursue him anyway.\n\nThat night, Shep brings his fianc\u00e9e Merle Kittridge to the Zodiac Club, meeting Gillian, Queenie, and Gillian's brother Nicky, a [[bongo drum]]-playing warlock. Recognizing Merle as an old college enemy, Gillian torments her with the club band until Merle flees, followed by Shep. Returning to Gillian's apartment, the Holroyds exchange Christmas gifts; Nicky gives Gillian an enchanted liquid, with which they attempt to summon Redlitch. Queenie and Nicky depart when Shep arrives, and he reveals that he and Merle are eloping later that day. Gillian uses her [[Siamese cat]] and [[Familiar spirit|familiar]], [[Pyewacket (familiar spirit)|Pyewacket]], to cast a [[Love magic|love spell]] on Shep, who becomes immediately enamored of her.\n\nAfter spending all night out on the town with Gillian, the infatuated Shep breaks up with Merle. Redlitch arrives at Shep's office, having been magically compelled to meet him, and explains that he is researching witches in New York City for his next book. The oblivious Shep introduces him to the Holroyds, and Nicky later reveals his powers to Redlitch, offering him access to the witch community in exchange for half the book's profits. Reveling in her romance with Shep, Gillian is torn when he proposes to her; although witches lose their magic if they fall in love, she agrees to marry him.\n\nGillian and Nicky quarrel about his exposing their world to Redlitch, and about her preparing to renounce magic and marry Shep. Using her powers to make Shep lose all interest in publishing Nicky and Redlitch's book, Gillian confesses that she is a witch and their relationship is the result of her spell. Shep refuses to believe her, but runs into Queenie, who confirms Gillian's version of events. Believing she enchanted him purely to spite Merle, Shep leaves Gillian heartbroken. He goes to Nicky, who brings him to Bianca De Pass, a very powerful witch, who brews a potion for him to drink, breaking Gillian's spell over him.\n\nShep confronts Gillian and cruelly presents her with a broom. She threatens to curse Merle, but Pyewacket runs away, and Shep is unable to convince Merle that he was bewitched. Queenie finds Pyewacket, but the cat rejects Gillian, who is now able to cry \u2013 proof she has fallen in love and is no longer a witch. Weeks later, Mrs. De Pass has become Redlitch's new collaborator, and Queenie confides to Nicky that she is worried about Gillian. Pyewacket is sent to Shep's office, and he returns the cat to Gillian at her transformed store. She explains that Pyewacket is no longer her cat; Shep realizes from Gillian's tears that she truly loves him, and they reconcile with a passionate kiss. Watching through the window with Queenie, Nicky celebrates by casting a spell on the entire street.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[James Stewart]] as Shepherd \"Shep\" Henderson\n* [[Kim Novak]] as Gillian \"Gil\" Holroyd\n* [[Jack Lemmon]] as Nicky Holroyd\n* [[Ernie Kovacs]] as Sidney Redlitch\n* [[Hermione Gingold]] as Bianca De Pass\n* [[Elsa Lanchester]] as Aunt Queenie Holroyd\n* [[Janice Rule]] as Merle Kittridge\n* [[Bek Nelson]] as Tina, Shep's secretary\n* [[Howard McNear]] as Andy White, Shep's co-publisher\n* [[Dick Crockett]] as ad-lib bit (uncredited)\n}}\n\n== Production ==\n[[David O. Selznick]] purchased the rights to Van Druten's play in 1953,{{efn|Selznick's former wife [[Irene Mayer Selznick|Irene]] produced the play on Broadway.<ref name=VanDruten1951 />}} planning to cast his wife, [[Jennifer Jones]], in the part of Gil. At the urging of Daniel Taradash and Julian Blaustein,<ref name=McGilligan1997 /><ref name=Eliot2006 /> [[Columbia Pictures|Columbia]] purchased the property from Selznick in 1956.<ref name=Green2011 />\n\nTaradash, who had adapted ''[[From Here to Eternity]]'' (1953) for Columbia with great success, augmented the story slightly by incorporating characters who are only names in the play (notably Mrs. De Pass, and Shep's fianc\u00e9e Merle) and expanding the action to locations beyond Gil's apartment.<ref name=ErskineWelsh />\n\nFor the lead roles, Taradash and Blaustein hoped to get [[Rex Harrison]] and [[Lilli Palmer]], who had starred in the play, but Columbia chief Harry Cohn decided on Kim Novak for the female lead.<ref name=Dick2015 /> Novak was on loan to Paramount making ''[[Vertigo (film)|Vertigo]]'' and the scheduling conflict put Harrison out of consideration as well.<ref name=McGilligan1997 /> Taradash and Blaustein also suggested [[Cary Grant]] and [[Grace Kelly]] as the leads and [[Alexander Mackendrick]] to direct; Kelly got married, however, and there were creative differences between the studio and both Grant and Mackendrick.<ref name=McGilligan1997 /> Since the arrangement with Paramount for Novak's appearance in ''Vertigo'' included reciprocity, Cohn advanced James Stewart for the role of Shep.<ref name=Eliot2006 /> ''Bell, Book and Candle'' is generally recognized as Stewart's final romantic leading role.<ref name=Quirk1999 />\n\nEarly in 1957, producers also launched a somewhat promotional search for Siamese cats to play Pyewacket.<ref name=Mosby /> According to one release, as many as 12 cats were needed to perform the number of stunts in the film.<ref name=12cats /> The primary cat used for the role in close-ups was owned by animal trainer [[Frank Inn]], who reportedly gave the cat to Novak when he saw she'd formed a close bond with him.  Pyewacket's name was derived from testimony given in a 17th-century witch trial in England, and referred to a witch's familiar.\n\nProduction began on February 3, 1958, and was completed on April 7.<ref name=AFI />\n\n=== Music ===\nThe film was scored by [[George Duning]], another Columbia veteran who earned praise for his work on ''From Here to Eternity''. The main theme melds bongos and violins, evoking elements of the plot;<ref name=Hischak2015 /> heard during the opening credits, a few staves of \"Jingle Bells\" are incorporated to set the Christmas tone of the initial action. Each witch, including Pyewacket the cat, is identified by a musical signature. Duning used creative means such as recording sounds and replaying them at high speed to achieve an eerie background effect for the score.<ref name=Hischak2015 />\n\nThe soundtrack was released in January 1959 by [[Colpix]] (CT-506).<ref name=Billboard />{{efn|Re-issued by Citadel Records in 1976 (CT-6006) and 1978 (CT-7006).<ref name=Pitts2010 />}} Most of the recording took place in [[Munich]] with Duning conducting the [[Graunke Symphony Orchestra]]. The segments featuring the [[Pete Candoli|Brothers Candoli]], who appear in the film playing at the Zodiac Club, were recorded in Hollywood at Columbia; on these tracks, [[John Williams]] can be heard on piano.<ref name=CT7006 />\n\n[[Philippe Clay]] makes a cameo appearance in the film performing \"Le Noy\u00e9 Assassin\u00e9\" at the Zodiac Club, but this performance is not included on the soundtrack album. However, Harkit Records in England (harkitrecords.com) have reissued the soundtrack album as HRKCD 8099 which does include the Phillippe Clay track.\n\n==Home media==\nThe film was released on DVD on March 28, 2000.
