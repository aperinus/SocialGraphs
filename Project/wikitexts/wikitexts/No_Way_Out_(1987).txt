Woodstock, New York: [[The Overlook Press]]. {{ISBN|0-87951-479-5}}</ref> [[political cinema|political]] [[action thriller film]] directed by [[Roger Donaldson]] and starring [[Kevin Costner]], [[Gene Hackman]], [[Will Patton]] and [[Sean Young]]. [[Howard Duff]], [[George Dzundza]], [[Jason Bernard]], [[Fred Thompson]], and [[Iman (model)|Iman]] appear in supporting roles. The film is based on the 1946 novel ''[[The Big Clock]]'' by [[Kenneth Fearing]], previously filmed as ''[[The Big Clock (film)|The Big Clock]]'' (1948) and ''[[Police Python 357]]'' (1976).\n\n==Plot==\nIn the opening scene of the movie, set in a house in Washington, near the Pentagon, Lt. Cdr. Tom Farrell of the [[Office of Naval Intelligence]] is shown being debriefed by 2 other men.  He is tired and bloodied.  His interrogators press him on how Farrell came to meet the [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]] David Brice.\n\nThe story flashes back 6 months, showing Farrell attending an [[inaugural ball]], invited by Scott Pritchard, a his college buddy who intends to introduce him to [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]] David Brice. There, Farrell also meets Susan Atwell, and the two begin an affair. Brice and Pritchard, his second-in-command, later hire Farrell to get secret information from other government agencies, such as the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]], and pass it on to Brice. Farrell finds that he may be at times working with Sam Hesselman, an old friend now working as a programmer/analyst in [[the Pentagon]]'s new computer center. Atwell eventually tells Farrell that she is Brice's mistress.\n\nAfter Atwell and Farrell return from a romantic weekend, Brice visits her unexpectedly and becomes suspicious that she has another lover. When Atwell tells Brice to leave, he becomes enraged and accidentally pushes her to her death over an upstairs railing. Brice confesses what has happened to Pritchard, who suggests that if Atwell's other lover were alleged to be a suspected [[KGB]] [[sleeper agent]] code-named \"Yuri\", then investigating her death could be made a matter of national security and \"Yuri\" could be killed \"in the line of duty\" by operatives under Pritchard's control. At Atwell's house, Pritchard discovers the negative of a photograph she had earlier taken of Farrell. The negative is blurry and does not show a recognizable face, but Hesselman attempts to have the image enhanced by computer, a process that may take days.\n \n[[United States Army Criminal Investigation Command|Army CID]] officers, commanded by Major Donovan, scour Atwell's apartment for evidence. Meanwhile, as his initial shock begins to wear away, Farrell realizes that Brice is the real murderer and that Pritchard is helping him cover up the crime. At the same time, Farrell also becomes aware that the evidence gathered so far makes him the prime suspect. Farrell determines to play along with the bogus investigation until he can develop evidence linking Brice to Atwell, so that he can defend himself against being charged with both murder and [[espionage]] (as \"Yuri\").\n\nFarrell learns that one piece of evidence is a Moroccan jewel box, a gift to Atwell from Brice. As any foreign gift must be registered with the [[U.S. Department of State|State Department]], Farrell gets Hesselman to \"raid\" State's computerized registry of such items, which should link the gift to Brice. However, the plan begins unraveling when Pritchard finds Atwell's address book, which Pritchard uses to track down and question her friend Nina. She pretends not to recognize Farrell, but reveals that she knows that Atwell was dating Brice. Pritchard sends two former CIA assassins to eliminate her. Overhearing this, Farrell delays the assassins while warning Nina, who goes into hiding. This activity raises Pritchard's suspicions of Farrell's loyalty to Brice and himself, as well as his motives for attempting to disrupt the coverup.\n\nFarrell convinces Hesselman to delay the photo enhancement by confiding to him that Farrell is the person in the photo, that he was in love with Atwell, and that Brice killed Atwell. The CID begins a search of the Pentagon on grounds that \"Yuri\" is somewhere in the building, but Farrell eludes the search by climbing into a ceiling vent. Believing that Farrell is delusional, Hesselman informs Pritchard about what he has told him. Hesselman is then killed by Pritchard. Knowing that Farrell has a printout of the gift registry data connecting him to Atwell, Brice improvises a different story: Pritchard, who is [[gay]], killed Atwell out of jealousy of Brice's relationship with her. The devastated Pritchard commits [[suicide]] and, when guards break in, Brice identifies Pritchard as \"Yuri,\" concluding the search for the spy.\n\nFarrell quietly sends the printout by courier to the [[Director of the Central Intelligence Agency|Director of the CIA]], an enemy of Brice, then leaves the Pentagon as the finished image enhancement of the photograph positively reveals Farrell as Atwell's lover. Later, Farrell is picked up by two men while sitting despondently at Atwell's grave, the men shown at the beginning of the story.  They begin to interrogate Farrell about why things were so \"poorly handled.\"\n\nFarrell angrily confronts the chief interrogator who is revealed to be, not American, but Russian, and that Farrell ''has'' actually been \"Yuri\" the entire time, a deep cover Soviet agent passing as an American and working as a high level [[Mole (espionage)|mole]] inside the Pentagon. The KGB ordered Farrell to seduce Brice's mistress to gather intelligence from her. Farrell's handler, his landlord, tells \"Yuri\" that America is no longer safe for him and that it is time for him to return to the [[Soviet Union]]. Revealing that he genuinely loved Susan Atwell, Farrell refuses and tells his handlers that he is finished being a spy. Though the other KGB are ready to kill Farrell, his handler orders to them to allow Farrell to escape, believing that Farrell will return on his own.  In the final scenes, Farrell is seen driving away from the house, to meet an uncertain fate.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Castlist|\n* [[Kevin Costner]] as Lieutenant Commander Tom Farrell, U.S. Navy\n* [[Gene Hackman]] as Secretary of Defense David Brice\n* [[Sean Young]] as Susan Atwell\n* [[Will Patton]] as Scott Pritchard, general counsel to Brice\n* [[Howard Duff]] as Senator Duvall\n* [[George Dzundza]] as Dr. Sam Hesselman\n* [[Jason Bernard]] as Major Donovan, [[United States Army Criminal Investigation Command|CID]]\n* [[Iman (model)|Iman]] as Nina Beka\n* [[Fred Thompson|Fred Dalton Thompson]] as CIA Director Marshall\n* Michael Shillo as Schiller\n* [[David Paymer]] as Technician\n* [[Robert Kerman]] as CID Man\n* [[Brad Pitt]] as Party Guest (uncredited)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://movieclips.com/Rar7S-no-way-out-movie-videos/ |title=No Way Out |access-date=July 11, 2022 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130601095002/http://movieclips.com/Rar7S-no-way-out-movie-videos/ |archive-date=June 1, 2013 |website=MovieClips}}</ref>\n}}\n\n==Production==\n===Writing===\nThe screenplay is based on [[Kenneth Fearing]]'s 1946 novel ''[[The Big Clock]]''.\n\n===Filming===\nExteriors were shot on location in [[Baltimore]], [[Annapolis, Maryland|Annapolis]], [[Arlington County, Virginia|Arlington]], [[Washington, D.C.]], and [[Auckland]], [[New Zealand]], between April 1986 and June 1986.
