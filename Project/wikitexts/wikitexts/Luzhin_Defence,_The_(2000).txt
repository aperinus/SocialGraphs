The film centres on a mentally tormented [[Grandmaster (chess)|chess grandmaster]] and the young woman he meets while competing at a [[chess tournament|world-class tournament]] in Italy. The [[screenplay]] was based on the novel ''[[The Defense]]'' (or ''The Luzhin Defence'') by [[Vladimir Nabokov]].\n\nEmily Watson received best actress nominations <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bifa.film/awards/nominations/2000|title=Nominations 2000|website=www.bifa.film|access-date=2018-06-03}}</ref> at the [[British Independent Film Awards]] and the [[London Film Critics Circle]] Awards.\n\n==Plot==\nIt's the early 1920s and Aleksandr Ivanovich 'Sascha' Luzhin (Turturro), a gifted but tormented chess player, arrives in a Northern Italian city to compete in an international chess competition. Prior to the tournament he meets Natalia Katkov (Watson) and he falls in love with her almost immediately. She in turn finds his manner to be appealing and they begin to see each other in spite of her mother's disapproval.\n\nCompeting alongside Luzhin in the championship is Dottore Salvatore Turati ([[Fabio Sartor]]), who is approached by Leo Valentinov ([[Stuart Wilson (actor)|Stuart Wilson]]), a Russian, who is Luzhin's former chess tutor from pre-revolutionary Russia. Valentinov tells the Italian that Luzhin cannot handle pressure and he intimates he will make sure that his former prodigy will be unsettled off-table, giving Turati a winning chance.\n\nThe competition starts badly for Luzhin, who is unsettled by the presence of his former friend and coach. He struggles through the early rounds but he soon begins to win again as his relationship with Katkov becomes closer and intimate. She then informs her parents that she is going to marry him. Meanwhile, Luzhin goes on to reach the final and face Turati.\n\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Luzhin Defence 2.jpg|left|thumb|Luzhin and Turati<br/>{{deletable image-caption|Friday, 27 April 2018|PROD}}]] -->\nBut in the finals the Russian [[\u00c9migr\u00e9]] loses out to the time clock, forcing the game to adjourn. However, outside the venue, he is whisked away by an accomplice of Valentinov who abandons him in the countryside. His former teacher knows that this will completely unhinge him because of the memory of his parents' abandonment many years ago. Luzhin wanders aimlessly until he collapses and is found by a group of [[Blackshirts]].\n\nLuzhin is taken to the hospital suffering from complete mental exhaustion. The doctor informs Katkov that he will die if he keeps playing chess as he is addicted to the game and it's consuming his very being. Nevertheless, even while recuperating Valentinov comes around with a chess board encouraging Luzhin to finish the match with the Italian, Turati. Natalia defends her beloved but urges him to break off with the game. Luzhin seems to agree.\n\nEventually Luzhin leaves the hospital. He and Natalia then agree to marry at the earliest opportunity. However, on the morning of the wedding, Luzhin is put into a car with Valentinov, who tells him that there is the small matter of finishing the competition. In terror, Luzhin leaps from the car. Dazed, cut and mentally confused, he stumbles back to the hotel where he tries to dig up the rest of the glass chess pieces he buried on the grounds years ago, (1:36:39 \"I've got the King but I need the whole army...\") but he does not find them.\n\nLuzhin, who is in his muddied wedding suit, sits in his room as Natalia and the hotel staff try to open the door. But before they can get in, the troubled chess grandmaster throws himself out of his bedroom window and dies. The tragic death is witnessed by Valentinov who has just arrived by car.\n\nThe film then concludes in the competition hall where Natalia completes the competition using her fianc\u00e9's notes. She discovers the papers in his pocket and an experienced chess player explains to her the matter of the notes. In an arranged meeting without  public she plays against  Turati who does exactly what Luzhin expected and loses. Katkov and Turati then leave acknowledging the [[Pyrrhic victory]] and the genius of Luzhin.\n\n==Production notes==\nNabokov based ''[[The Defense]]'' on the life of German [[chess master]] [[Curt von Bardeleben]], who seemingly committed [[suicide]]  by leaping from a window in 1924.<ref>\"In all probability suffering from severe arteriosclerosis, he has had a slight dizzy spell or a rush of blood to the head, and in seeking some fresh air by opening a low silled window he fell out.\"  Mieses and Kagan in ''Nachrufe'' in ''Kagans Neueste Schachnachrichten,'' Sonderheft No. ''2,'' 1924</ref>\n\nThe film was shot entirely in Europe. [[Budapest]], Hungary was used for outdoor scenes as they were set in [[St Petersburg]], these included the  [[Sz\u00e9chenyi Chain Bridge]], [[Hungarian National Museum]] and [[H\u0151s\u00f6k tere|Heroes' Square]]. The chess tournament (although in Italy) was shot inside the main hall of the [[Ethnographic Museum (Budapest)|Museum of Ethnography]], Budapest. In Italy, the hotel scenes were filmed at [[Villa Erba]], [[Cernobbio]], on the [[Lake Como]]. The scene at the railway station is in Brenna-Alzate, near [[Como]].\n\nIn the novel, Valentinov's first name is never mentioned;<ref name=Toker>Leona Toker.

Cornell University Press, Ithaca, New York, 1989. {{ISBN|0-8014-2211-6}}</ref> on the contrary, Luzhin's  first name is revealed only in the closing sentences.<ref name=Toker/> Another dissimilarity is that the novel ends up by Luzhin's suicide, thereby his game would be never finished.\n\n==The finale==\n{{chess notation}}\n{{Chess diagram small\n| tright\n|Turati vs. Luzhin\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |kd|  |  \n|  |  |  |  |  |pd|  |pd\n|pd|  |  |  |  |  |pd|  \n|  |  |bd|  |  |  |  |  \n|pl|  |  |  |  |pl|  |  \n|  |pl|nl|  |rd|kl|  |  \n|  |  |  |  |bl|  |pl|pl\n|  |  |rl|  |  |  |  |  \n| White to move\n}}\nThe [[chess]] position they play for the final between Turati and Luzhin is already a winning position for Black (Luzhin), even though Black is down on [[material (chess)|material]].

Kg4 this leads to a heavy material loss for White and an easy game for Black:\n* '''1. Kf2 Rxc3+'''\n* '''2.

The tournament had been paused after Luzhin had a nervous breakdown which had been caused by extreme strain. On the same day he was going to get married he committed suicide by jumping from the hotel balcony. His fianc\u00e9 later found a piece of paper inside his jacket where he had written down his intended final moves against Turati.\n\n==Cinematic error==\n{{Chess diagram small\n| tright\n|Luzhin vs. Unknown\n\n|  |  |  |  |rl|  |kd|  \n|  |  |  |  |  |pd|bd|  \n|  |pd|  |nl|  |  |  |pd\n|pd|  |  |  |  |  |pd|  \n|  |  |  |  |  |qd|  |  \n|ql|  |  |  |  |  |  |pl\n|pl|pl|  |  |  |  |  |  \n|  |  |rd|rl|  |  |  |kl\n| Black to move\n}}\nIn Luzhin's previous game, on his way to the final, the film shows an inaccurate [[checkmate|checkmating]] move.
