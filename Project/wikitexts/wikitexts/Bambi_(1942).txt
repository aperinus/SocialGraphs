Current count is 392 words.-->\nA doe gives birth to a fawn named [[Bambi (character)|Bambi]], who will one day take over the position of Great Prince of the Forest, a title currently held by Bambi's father, who guards the woodland creatures against the dangers of hunters. The fawn is quickly befriended by an eager, energetic rabbit named [[Thumper (Bambi)|Thumper]], who helps to teach him to walk and speak. Bambi grows up very attached to his mother, with whom he spends most of his time. He soon makes other friends, including a young skunk he mistakenly calls \"Flower\" (who is so flattered, he keeps the name) and a female fawn named Faline. Curious and inquisitive, Bambi frequently asks about the world around him and is cautioned about the dangers of life as a forest creature by his loving mother. One day out in a meadow, Bambi briefly sees The Great Prince but does not realize that he is his father. As the Great Prince wanders uphill, he discovers the human hunter, named \"Man\" by all the animals, is coming and rushes down to the meadow to get everyone to safety. Bambi is briefly separated from his mother during that time but is escorted to her by the Great Prince as the three of them make it back in the forest just as Man fires his gun.\n\nDuring Bambi's first winter, he and Thumper play in the snow while Flower hibernates. One day his mother takes him along to find food when Man shows up again. As they escape, his mother is shot and killed by the hunter, leaving the little fawn mournful and alone. Taking pity on his abandoned son, the Great Prince leads Bambi home as he reveals to him that he is his father. Next year, Bambi has matured into a young stag, and his childhood friends have also entered young adulthood. They are warned of \"twitterpation\" by Friend Owl and that they will eventually fall in love, although the trio views the concept of romance with scorn. However, Thumper and Flower soon encounter their beautiful romantic counterparts and abandon their former thoughts on love. Bambi himself encounters Faline as a beautiful doe. However, their courtship is quickly interrupted and challenged by a belligerent older stag named Ronno, who attempts to force Faline away from Bambi. Bambi successfully manages to defeat Ronno in battle and earn the rights to the doe's affections.\n\nBambi is awakened afterward by the smell of smoke; he follows it and discovers it leads to a hunter camp. His father warns Bambi that Man has returned with more hunters. Although Bambi is separated from Faline in the turmoil and searches for her along the way, the two flee to safety. He soon finds her cornered by Man's vicious hunting dogs, which he manages to ward off. Bambi escapes them and is shot by Man, but survives. Meanwhile, at the \"Man's\" camp, their campfire suddenly spreads into the forest, resulting in a wildfire from which the forest residents flee in fear. Bambi, his father, Faline, and the forest animals manage to reach shelter on a riverbank. The following spring, Faline gives birth to twins under Bambi's watchful eye as the new Great Prince of the Forest.\n\n==Cast==\n<!--please make sure you are linking to the proper actor when editing this section-->\n[[File:Bambi 1942 trailer- 00 min 29 s.png|thumb|400px|Screenshot of Bambi, Thumper and Flower from the January 1942 theatrical trailer for the film]]\n* [[Bambi (character)|Bambi]], the film's title character and protagonist:\n** Bobby Stewart as Baby Bambi\n** [[Donnie Dunagan]] as Young Bambi\n** [[Hardie Albright]] as Adolescent Bambi\n** [[John Sutherland (producer)|John Sutherland]] as Young Adult Bambi{{ref|a}}\n* [[Thumper (Bambi)|Thumper]], a [[rabbit]] friend of Bambi's:\n** Peter Behn as Young Thumper\n** Tim Davis as Adolescent Thumper\n** [[Sam Edwards]] as Young Adult Thumper\n* [[Paula Winslowe]] as Bambi's Mother and the Pheasant\n* Flower, a [[striped skunk]] and another friend of Bambi's:\n** Stan Alexander as Young Flower\n** Tim Davis as Adolescent Flower\n** [[Sterling Holloway]] as Young Adult Flower\n* [[Will Wright (actor)|Will Wright]] as Friend Owl\n* Faline, a female deer whom Bambi eventually falls in love with:\n**[[Cammie King]] as Young Faline\n** [[Ann Gillis]] as Young Adult Faline\n* Fred Shields as Great Prince of the Forest\n* Margaret Lee as Mrs. Rabbit\n* Mary Lansing as Aunt Ena and Mrs. Possum\n* [[Perce Pearce]] as Mr. Mole\n* [[Thelma Boardman]] as Girl Bunny, Quail Mother, Female Pheasant\n\n===Notes===\n{{note|a}}Sources differ on whether Sutherland actually voiced Young Adult Bambi.<ref>{{cite web|author=Tom Heintjes|url=http://cartoonician.com/animating-ideas-the-john-sutherland-story/|title=Animating Ideas: The John Sutherland Story|publisher=Cartoonician.com|date=May 24, 2012|access-date=April 13, 2014|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140413155243/http://cartoonician.com/animating-ideas-the-john-sutherland-story/|archive-date=April 13, 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Production==\n\n===Development===\nIn 1933, [[Sidney Franklin (director)|Sidney Franklin]], a producer and director at [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]], purchased the film rights to [[Felix Salten]]'s novel ''[[Bambi, a Life in the Woods]]'', intending to adapt it as a live-action film. After years of experimentation, he eventually decided that it would be too difficult to make such a film and he sold the film rights to [[Walt Disney]] in April 1937.<ref name=\"Barrier, Michael 1999\">Barrier, Michael, 1999, ''Hollywood Cartoons'', Oxford University Press, United Kingdom</ref> Disney began work on crafting an animated adaptation immediately, intending it to be the company's second feature-length animated film and their first to be based on a specific, recent work.<ref name=\"Barrier, Michael 1999\"/> However, the original novel was written for an adult audience, and was considered too \"grim\" and \"somber\" for a regular light-hearted Disney film.<ref name=\"Barrier, Michael 1999\"/> The artists also discovered that it would be challenging to animate deer realistically.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">''The Making of Bambi: A Prince is Born'', Bambi Blu-Ray, 2011</ref> These difficulties resulted in Disney putting production on hold while the studio worked on several other projects.<ref name=\"Barrier, Michael 1999\"/> In 1938, Disney assigned Perce Pearce and Carl Fallberg to work on the film's storyboards, but attention was soon drawn away as the studio began working on ''[[Fantasia (1940 film)|Fantasia]]''.<ref name=\"Barrier, Michael 1999\"/> Finally, on August 17, 1939, production on ''Bambi'' began in earnest, but progressed slowly owing to changes in the studio personnel, location, and methodology of handling animation at the time.<ref name=\"Barrier, Michael 1999\"/>\n\n===Writing===\nThere were many interpretations of the story. As [[Mel Shaw]] claimed {{cquote|The story of ''Bambi'' had a so many possibilities, you could go off on a million tangents. I remember one situation when Walt became involved with himself. He said 'Suppose we have Bambi step on an ant hill and we cut inside and see all the damage he's done to the ant civilization'. We spent weeks and weeks developing the ants, and then all of a sudden we decided, you know, we're way off the story, this has got nothing to do with the story of ''Bambi''. We also had a family of grasshoppers, and they get into a family squabble of this or that, and Bambi is watching all of this, and here's the big head of Bambi in the grasshoppers. And what's that got to do with the story, and this would go on many times.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>}}\n\nOriginally the film was intended to have six individual bunny characters, similar to the dwarfs in ''Snow White''. However Perce Pearce suggested that they could instead have five generic rabbits and one rabbit with a different color than the rest, with one tooth, would have a very distinct personality.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">''Inside Walt's Story Meetings'', Bambi 2011 Blu-ray</ref> This character later became known as Thumper.\n\nThere originally was a brief shot in the scene where Bambi's mother dies after jumping over a log and getting shot by a man. Larry Morey, however, felt the scene was too dramatic, and that it was emotional enough to justify having her death occur off screen.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/><ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> Walt Disney was also eager to show the man burned to death by his fire that he inadvertently started, but this was discarded when it was decided not to show the man at all.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> There was also a scene involving two autumn leaves conversing like an old married couple before parting ways and falling to the ground, but Disney found that talking flora did not work in the context of the film, and instead a visual metaphor of two realistic leaves falling to the ground was used instead.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> Disney and his story team also developed the characters consisting of a squirrel and a chipmunk that were to be a comic duo reminiscent of [[Laurel and Hardy]]. However, after years of experimentation, Walt felt that the story should focus on the three principal characters: Bambi, Thumper and Flower.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> The squirrel and chipmunk make only brief appearances in the final film.\n\nThe writing was completed in July 1940, by which time the film's budget had increased to $858,000.<ref name=\"Barrier, Michael 1999\"/>\n\n===Animation===\nAlthough the animators had animated deer in ''Snow White'', they were animated, in the words of [[Eric Larson]], \"like big flour sacks\".<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> Disney wanted the animals in ''Bambi'' to be more realistic and expressive than those in ''Snow White''. He had Rico LeBrun, a painter of animals, come and lecture to the animators on the structure and movement of animals.<ref name=\"thomas\">{{cite book|last=Thomas|first=Bob|chapter=6: Expansion and War: ''Bambi''|pages=90\u20131|title=Disney's Art of Animation: From Mickey Mouse to Hercules|year=1997|isbn=978-0-7868-6241-2}}</ref> The animators visited the [[Los Angeles Zoo]] and Disney set up a small zoo at the studio with animals such as rabbits, ducks, owls, and skunks, and a pair of fawns named Bambi and Faline so that the artists could see first-hand the movement of these animals.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/><ref name=\"thomas\"/><ref>{{cite web|title=Walt Disney Collection: Walt's Masterworks |url=http://disney.go.com/disneyatoz/familymuseum/collection/masterworks/bambi/index.html |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070228102553/http://disney.go.com/disneyatoz/familymuseum/collection/masterworks/bambi/index.html |archive-date=February 28, 2007 }}</ref> Rico LeBurn's sketches depicted realistic animals, but as characters they lacked personality.

After her death, Wyler's husband sold the rights to Twin Books, a publishing company which subsequently filed a [[lawsuit]] against Disney, claiming Disney owed it money for the continued licensing for the use of the book. Disney countered by claiming that Salten had published the story in 1923 without a copyright notice, thus it immediately entered into the [[public domain]]. Disney also argued that if the claimed 1923 publication date was accurate, then the copyright renewal filed in 1954 had been registered after the deadline and was thus invalid. The courts initially upheld Disney's view; however, in 1996, the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit|Ninth Circuit]] Court reversed the decision on appeal in ''Twin Books Corp. v. Walt Disney Co.'', 83 [[F.3d]] 1162 (1996).<ref>{{cite web|title=Bambi, the Austrian Deer |url=http://courseweb.stthomas.edu/paschons/language_http/essays/salten.html |last=Schons |first=Paul |publisher=Germanic-American Institute |access-date=August 26, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080808113400/http://courseweb.stthomas.edu/paschons/language_http/essays/salten.html |archive-date=August 8, 2008 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref name=\"Findlaw 2020\">{{cite web | title=FindLaw's United States Ninth Circuit case and opinions. | website=Findlaw | date=2020-06-03 | url=https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-9th-circuit/1304377.html | access-date=2022-01-14}} {{PD-notice}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite book|last=Gabler|first=Neal|title=Walt Disney: The Triumph of American Imagination|year=2006|url=https://archive.org/details/waltdisneytriump00gabl|url-access=registration|publisher=Alfred A.
