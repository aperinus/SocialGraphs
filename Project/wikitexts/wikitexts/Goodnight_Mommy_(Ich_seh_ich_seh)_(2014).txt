The boys begin to question the woman's identity, believing that she isn't the same person as the one who went to surgery, and therefore wondering if she is their real mother.\n\n''Goodnight Mommy'' had its world premiere at the [[71st Venice International Film Festival]] on 30 August 2014 and was theatrically released on 5 January 2015, by Stadtkino Verleih. The film grossed $2 million worldwide and received generally positive reviews from critics, with praise for its performances, direction and screenplay. It was selected as the Austrian entry for the [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film|Best Foreign Language Film]] at the [[88th Academy Awards]], but it was not nominated.<ref name=\"Austria\">{{cite web|url=http://kurier.at/kultur/film/oscars-oesterreich-reicht-ich-seh-ich-seh-ein/150.412.911 |title=Oscars: \u00d6sterreich reicht \"Ich seh, ich seh\" |work=Kurier |date=2 September 2015 |access-date=2 September 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"FNE\">{{cite web|url=http://www.filmneweurope.com/news/austria-news/item/111179-austria-selects-goodnight-mommy-as-oscar-bid |title=Austria Selects Goodnight Mommy as Oscar Bid |work=Film New Europe |date=8 September 2015 |access-date=8 September 2015}}</ref>\n\nAn [[Goodnight Mommy (2022 film)|American remake of the film]] starring [[Naomi Watts]] was released on [[Amazon Prime Video]] on September 16, 2022.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://deadline.com/video/goodnight-mommy-trailer-naomi-watts-led-reimagining-of-austrian-thriller/ | title='Goodnight Mommy' Trailer: Naomi Watts Leads Amazon's Reimagining of Austrian Psychological Thriller | date=24 August 2022 }}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nAfter undergoing [[cosmetic facial surgery]], a woman (Susanne Wuest), who was formerly a choir member famous on local television, returns home to her modern, isolated lakeside house and to her nine-year-old [[identical twin]] sons, Elias and Lukas (Elias and Lukas Schwarz), who entered the house after playing outside in a cornfield and the nearby lake. Her head is swathed in bandages, with only her eyes and mouth visible. The twins are unnerved by their mother's appearance and are further taken aback when she begins to exhibit strange behavior. She pointedly ignores Lukas and appears to only acknowledge Elias in conversation and meal preparations. Though it is the middle of summer, the mother orders the twins to keep the blinds closed during the day (as recommended by her doctor to avoid sunlight) and not allow any visitors or any animals in the house, imposes a strict rule of silence inside the house (as she\u2019s required to rest after the surgery), and allows them to only play outdoors in the garden. The mother also acts cruelly and lashes out at Elias physically and verbally when he is mischievous or disobedient. The boys comment that this is something their mother would never do.\n\nThe twins begin to suspect that beneath her bandages, their mother may not be the same person. These doubts are confirmed when they find an old picture in the photo album that shows the mother with another unknown woman who is wearing identical clothes and shares similar physical traits (it is revealed by the woman that the other woman in the photo is her friend who dresses in the same clothes as her). With the suspicion that the woman residing in their house is an impostor, the twins escape from the house and go to a church in a nearby town, where they try to get help from the priest. The priest drives them home, and is satisfied with the woman's explanation that she is their mother, as well as the separation from her husband, and a tragic accident.\n \nThe boys tie the woman to the bed with bandages and tape and refuse to let her go until she tells them where their real mother is. The woman insists that she is their mother, and the twins use a magnifying glass to burn her face to compel her to reveal where their real mother is. They then seal her mouth with tape.\n\nTwo employees of the [[International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement|Red Cross]] arrive to collect donations. Although they initially await the return of the mother, they finally leave the house after receiving a large amount of cash from Elias, which he discreetly stole from his mother's purse. Meanwhile, the woman breaks free from the adhesive tape around her mouth and yells for help, but is too late to attract the attention of the Red Cross employees. The twins seal her lips with [[Cyanoacrylate|super glue]], only to realize that she is unable to eat. The twins cut open her lips with a small pair of scissors, slicing her mouth in the process.\n\nAs the woman is still bound and trapped, she [[Bedwetting|wets her bed]]. The twins briefly set her free from her shackles to change the bedding, allowing her to subdue the boys and escape. The twins, however, have set up a booby trap that causes her to fall, knocking her unconscious. The woman wakes glued to the living room floor. Elias starts to burn down the house to pressure her into telling them the truth about their mother. The woman firmly insists that she is the twins' real mother. As Lukas holds a candle to the curtains, Elias asks her to tell him what he is doing, claiming that if she was really their mother, she would know.\n\nDesperate, the woman breaks down and says she will play along with pretending that Lukas is there, revealing that Lukas in fact drowned during the opening sequence of the film. Lukas has been merely a [[hallucination]] as a result of [[dissociative identity disorder]] and is suffering from [[Capgras delusion]], incapable of accepting his other half's demise. Elias ignores her, allowing Lukas to set fire to the house. The flames spread, presumably killing them both.\n\nAs firefighters attempt to put out the fire, the woman, now unharmed and wearing a yellow dress that was previously shown in a happy family photo, leaves the house and walks into the woods. The final shot of the film shows Elias and Lukas walking through the cornfield and emerging to be with their mother, the three of them smiling and embracing, singing Lukas's favorite song.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Susanne Wuest]] as Mother\n* Elias Schwarz as Elias\n* Lukas Schwarz as Lukas\n* Hans Escher as Priester\n* Elfriede Schatz as Rotkreuz Sammlerin\n* Karl Purker as Rotkreuz Sammler\n* Georg Deliovsky as Pizzalieferant\n* Christian Steindl as Mesner\n* Christian Schatz as Bauer\n* Erwin Schmalzbauer as Akkordeongott\n\n==Reception==\nThe film generally received positive reviews from critics.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Catsoulis|first1=Jeannette|title=Review: Twin Terrors Haunt 'Goodnight Mommy'|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/11/movies/review-twin-terrors-haunt-goodnight-mommy.html|access-date=13 October 2015|work=The New York Times|date=10 September 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Dowd|first1=A.A.|title=Guessing the twist won't save you from the horrors of Goodnight Mommy|url=http://www.avclub.com/review/guessing-twist-wont-save-you-horrors-goodnight-mom-225022|access-date=13 October 2015|work=[[The A.V.
