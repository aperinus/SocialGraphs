Muriel secretly plans to knock out a wall and remodel their apartment for $7,000. After rejecting this idea, Jim comes across an ad for new homes in [[Connecticut]] and they get excited about moving. Planning to purchase and \"fix up\" an old home, they contact a real estate agent, who convinced them to buy \"the old Hackett Place\" in (fictional) Lansdale County, Connecticut\u2014a leaning, dilapidated, nearly 200-year old farmhouse on some 35 acres where, they are told, [[Horatio Gates|General Gates]] stopped to water his horses during the Revolutionary War. They buy the property for five times the going rate per acre for locals, provoking Jim's friend and lawyer Bill Cole to chastise him for following his heart rather than his head.\n\nThe old house, dating from the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]] era, turns out to be structurally unsound and must be torn down before the previous owner's mortgage is paid off. The Blandings hire architect Henry Simms to design and supervise the construction of a new home for $18,000, which Muriel insists must have four bedrooms and four bathrooms. From the original purchase to the completion of the new home, a long litany of unforeseen troubles and setbacks\u2014including digging a deep well only to find a spring just a few feet under the foundation\u2014beset the hapless Blandings. The demolished house's owner also sues them for the balance of his mortgage. Meanwhile, back in the city, Jim is given the task of creating a slogan for WHAM Ham, an account that has destroyed the careers of the previous executives assigned to it. Jim also suspects that Muriel is cheating on him when Bill spends a night in the house during a violent thunderstorm, with Muriel being the only other person present.\n\nWith mounting pressure, skyrocketing costs, and the encroaching deadline for his assignment, Jim starts to wonder why he wanted to live in the country. Bill observes that although he has been the voice of doom, pointing out all the ways they were being cheated, when he looks at what they have finally built, he realizes that some things \"you ''do'' buy with your heart and not your head. Maybe those are the things that really count.\u201d Gussie, a Black maid working for the Blandings, provides Jim with the perfect WHAM slogan\u2014\"If you ain't eating WHAM, you ain't eating ham\"\u2014and saves his job. The Blandings reward her with a $10 raise, and her likeness is used in the WHAM ad campaign.<ref>{{cite book |last=Regester |first=Charlene B. |date=14 June 2010 |title=African American Actresses: The Struggle for Visibility, 1900\u20131960 |location=Bloomington |publisher=Indiana University Press |page=103 |isbn=978-0253221926}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Palmer |first=Phyllis  |date=8 August 1991 |title=Domesticity And Dirt: Housewives and Domestic Servants in the United States, 1920-1945 |series=Women In The Political Economy  |location=Philadelphia\t|publisher=Temple University Press |page=40 |isbn=0877229015}}</ref> The film ends with the family and Bill enjoying the beautiful front yard.
