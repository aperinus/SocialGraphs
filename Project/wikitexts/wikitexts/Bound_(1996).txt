Violet ([[Jennifer Tilly]]), who longs to escape her relationship with her [[American Mafia|mafioso]] boyfriend Caesar ([[Joe Pantoliano]]), enters into a clandestine affair with alluring ex-con Corky ([[Gina Gershon]]), and the two women hatch a scheme to steal $2 million of Mafia money.\n\n''Bound'' was the first film directed by the Wachowskis, and they took inspiration from [[Billy Wilder]] to tell a noir story filled with sex and violence. Financed by [[Dino De Laurentiis]], the film was made on a tight budget with the help of frugal crew members including cinematographer [[Bill Pope]]. The directors initially struggled to cast the lesbian characters of Violet and Corky before securing Tilly and Gershon. To choreograph the sex scenes, the directors employed sex educator [[Susie Bright]], who also made a [[cameo appearance]] in the film.\n\n''Bound'' received positive reviews from film critics who praised the humor and style of the directors as well as the realistic portrayal of a lesbian relationship in a mainstream film. Detractors of the film found its plot superficial and criticized the violence as excessive. The film won several festival awards.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 to 700 words. -->\nCorky, a [[lesbian]] ex-con, is hired as a painter and plumber at an apartment building. She encounters Violet and Caesar, the couple who live next-door to the apartment she is renovating. While Caesar is gone, Violet deliberately drops an earring down the sink; the building owner sends Corky to retrieve it. Violet admits to purposely dropping the earring and starts to seduce Corky. They are interrupted by Caesar's arrival and Corky returns to work. When she leaves for the day, Violet follows her to her truck, and they have sex in Corky's apartment. The next morning, Violet tells Corky that Caesar is a [[money laundering|money launderer]] for the [[Italian-American Mafia|Mafia]] and they have been together for five years.\n\nLater, Violet overhears Caesar and his mob associates beating and torturing Shelly, a man who has been [[embezzlement|skimming]] money from the business. Upset by the violence, Violet confides to Corky that she wants to make a new life for herself, but that she needs her help. Knowing that Caesar will bring the nearly $2 million that Shelly embezzled back to the apartment, the two women hatch a scheme to steal the money. After Mafia boss Gino Marzzone's son Johnnie shoots and kills Shelly, Caesar returns to the apartment with a bag of bloody money. Angry at Johnnie for furiously killing Shelly and splattering blood everywhere, Caesar proceeds to wash, iron and hang the money to dry.\n\nViolet explains to Corky that Caesar and Johnnie hate each other, and that Gino and Johnnie will be coming to pick up the money from Caesar. Corky devises a plan: when Caesar has finished counting the money, he will shower to unwind. While he does, Violet will purposely drop a bottle of [[The Glenlivet distillery|Glenlivet]] scotch that Gino prefers and tell Caesar that she is going to buy more. As she leaves the apartment, Corky will enter, steal the money from a briefcase, and leave. Violet will then return with the scotch and tell Caesar that she just saw Johnnie leave. Suspicious, Caesar will check the briefcase, find the money gone, and assume Johnnie has taken it. Corky and Violet think Caesar will be forced to flee because Gino will assume he has been robbed by Caesar, not Johnnie.\n\nWhen Caesar finds the money gone, he realizes Gino will think he stole it if he runs and decides to retrieve the money from Johnnie. Panicking, Violet threatens to leave, but Caesar forces her to stay, suspecting she and Johnnie may have stolen the money and framed him. Corky waits next-door with the money while Gino and Johnnie arrive. After Johnnie flirts with Violet and taunts him, Caesar pulls out a gun and tells Gino that his son stole the money. He kills Gino, Johnnie and Roy, Gino's bodyguard. Caesar tells Violet that they must find the money, dispose of the bodies, and pretend Gino and Johnnie never arrived lest their mob pals discover their absence. Unable to find the money at Johnnie's apartment, Caesar telephones Mickey, a mob buddy, telling him that Gino has yet to arrive.\n\nAfter discovering Corky and Violet stole the money, Caesar ties them up, threatens to torture them, and demands to know where it is. When Mickey arrives at the apartment, Caesar makes a deal with Violet to help him stall. Violet calls their landline from Johnnie's cell phone and convinces Caesar to feign a conversation with Gino explaining that he and Johnnie are in the hospital after a car accident. The ruse fools Mickey, who leaves for the hospital. Corky tells Caesar she has hidden the money in the next-door apartment and he goes to retrieve it. Violet escapes and calls Mickey, telling him that Caesar stole the money and forced her to keep quiet. Corky tries to stop Caesar from taking the money, but he assaults her. Violet arrives and holds Caesar at gunpoint; she informs him Mickey is coming and that he should run while he can. When Caesar refuses, Violet kills him.\n\nLater, Mickey, who believes Violet's story, tells her that he will find Caesar. Mickey wants Violet to be his girlfriend, but she tells him that she needs a clean break\u2014which she makes by driving off hand-in-hand with Corky.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Gina Gershon]] as Corky\n* [[Jennifer Tilly]] as Violet\n* [[Joe Pantoliano]] as Caesar\n* [[Mary Mara]] as Bartender\n* [[Susie Bright]] as Jesse\n* [[Margaret Smith (comedian)|Margaret Smith]] as Woman Cop\n* [[Barry Kivel]] as Sheldon 'Shelly'\n* [[Christopher Meloni]] as Johnnie Marzzone\n* [[John P.

He and the Wachowskis drew inspiration from their love of comics and were particularly influenced by [[Frank Miller's]] neo-noir ''[[Sin City]]'' series.<ref name=\"Marx\" /> Pope's sound counterpart was sound director [[Dane Davis]]. In the scene where Corky and Violet plan the theft, he chose to give Corky a [[cat]]-like quality, by supplying a \"swishing\" sound each time she walked past the camera.<ref name=\"DVD\" />\n\nThe Wachowskis asked Joe Pantoliano to watch [[John Huston]]'s ''[[The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (film)|The Treasure of the Sierra Madre]]'' and to focus on [[Humphrey Bogart]]'s character in order to portray Caesar's  paranoia.<ref name=\"DVD\" /> Gershon's role was influenced by [[James Dean]], [[Marlon Brando]] and [[Clint Eastwood]].<ref name=\"DVD\" /> Both Gershon and Tilly were nervous about the sex scenes, and prepared for filming by drinking [[tequila]].<ref name=\"diva\" />\n\nVery little improvisation took place during the filming due to the directors' extensive planning and clear vision for the film.<ref name=\"DVD\" /> Despite their planning, the physical exchanges in the script caused some injuries. Barry Kivel was injured, when his head was banged against a toilet, in the scene where Shelly was violently beaten in Caesar's bathroom. Gina Gershon was also injured. In a scene between Corky and Caesar, near the end of the film, Gershon struck a gun from Joe Pantoliano's hand so violently, that she required [[surgical suture|stitches]].<ref name=\"DVD\" />\n\n===Sex scenes===\nThe sex scenes were choreographed by feminist writer and sex educator [[Susie Bright]]. The Wachowskis were fans of Bright and sent her a copy of the script with a letter asking her to be an extra in the film. Bright loved the script, particularly as it was about women unapologetically having and enjoying sex. Disappointed by the lack of description in the sex scenes, she offered to be a sex consultant for the film, and they accepted.<ref name=\"DVD\" /> The main sex scene, set in Corky's apartment, was filmed in one long shot. The Wachowskis believed that the continuous shot would be more realistic than several shots edited together.<ref name=\"DVD\" /> Although it was intended to be a closed set, there were actually many people present, moving the walls of the set in order to allow full movement of the camera around the actors.<ref name=\"DVD\" />\n\nBright appeared as Jesse, the woman Corky tries to talk to in the bar. Comedian [[Margaret Smith (comedian)|Margaret Smith]] played Jesse's girlfriend and the extras in the bar scene were Bright's friends\u2014\"real life San Francisco [[Dyke (slang)|dykes]]\".<ref name=\"DVD\" />\n\n==Themes==\nThe Wachowskis describe several themes present in ''Bound''. They say that the film is about \"the boxes people make of their lives\", that it is not only gay people who \"live in [[Closeted|closets]]\". They wanted to define all of ''Bound''{{'s}} characters by the \"sort of trap that they were making out of their lives\".<ref name=\"gadfly\" /> Violet is trapped in her life with Caesar, and in the first scene, Corky is literally inside Violet's closet, bound and gagged by Caesar.<ref name=\"DVD\" /> This scene is echoed later in the film when Violet says \"I had this image of you inside of me...\"<ref name=\"DVD\" /> This theme of being trapped is exacerbated by the claustrophobic feeling created by the fact that most of the film takes place in Violet and Casear's apartment, or the apartment next door where Corky is working.<ref name=\"DVD\" />\n\nSusie Bright described some of the specifically lesbian themes of the film. One is the concept of the hand as a sex organ, highlighted by lingering camera shots of Corky and Violet's hands.<ref name=\"DVD\" /> Another is the repeated use of water as a symbolic [[Motif (visual arts)|motif]] to represent women, present for example when Corky is retrieving Violet's earring from the sink.<ref name=\"DVD\" /> Bright describes it as a movie that is \"wet\" (feminine) as opposed to \"hard\" (masculine).<ref name=\"DVD\" /> She says the scene where Corky and Violet have their first conversation is full of \"lesbian signs\". She highlights the fact that Violet, away from Caesar, is wearing jeans and able to be less overtly feminine. Jennifer Tilly says that whenever Violet is talking to men, her voice becomes high-pitched and \"girly\"\u2014making her seem vulnerable and ensuring she is taken care of. Joe Pantoliano agrees, saying that the result is that \"everyone in the film wants to be with Violet\".<ref name=\"DVD\" /> When she is with Corky, Violet can drop the act and talk at a more natural pitch. According to Bright, the more subtle lesbian themes of the film were noticed and appreciated at the [[LGBT]] film festival screenings.<ref name=\"DVD\" />\n\n==Release==\n===Rating===\n''Bound'' was rated by the [[Motion Picture Association of America]] (MPAA) as R for \"strong sexuality, violence and language.\" To achieve that rating, the directors had to cut part of the first sex scene between Corky and Violet.<ref name=\"DVD\" /> The MPAA were most concerned with the images of what Lana Wachowski called \"hand-sex\".<ref name=\"MM\">{{cite book | last =Merck | first =Mandy | title =In Your Face: 9 Sexual Studies | publisher =NYU Press | year =2000 | pages =124\u2013147 | isbn =0-8147-5639-5 }}</ref> It was rated R in Australia, R18 in New Zealand and 18 in the United Kingdom.
