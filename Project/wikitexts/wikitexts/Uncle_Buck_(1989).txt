Brown]] and [[Elaine Bromka]]. The film tells the story of a bachelor who babysits his brother's rebellious teenage daughter and her younger brother and sister while the parents are away.\n\n''Uncle Buck'' was released in theaters on August 16, 1989, by [[Universal Pictures]] and grossed $79.2 million against a $15 million budget. The film was met with mixed reviews.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 to 700 words. -->\nBob and Cindy Russell and their three children, teen Tia, 8 y.o. Miles, and 6 y.o. Maizy, have recently moved from [[Indianapolis]] to the [[Chicago metropolitan area|Chicago suburbs]] due to Bob's promotion.\n\nBob's brother Buck, on the other hand, lives in a small apartment in [[Wrigleyville]] with no responsibilities. He drinks, smokes, has rarely held down a job and drives a dilapitated car. Buck's girlfriend of eight years, Chanice, wants to get married and start a family, but Buck is resistant to change. To appease her, he has grudgingly agreed to work at her tire shop.\n\nCindy's aunt in Indianapolis call at midnight, informing them that her father has had a heart attack. So Bob and Cindy want to leave immediately to be with him. When Tia hears the news, bitter about being forced to move, blames Cindy saying she had abandoned her father. Bob suggests asking Buck to come and watch the children, to which Cindy objects as she considers him to be unsuitable.\n\nAs neither parent finds another alternative, they end up calling Buck. He cheerfully accepts then, when he informs Chanice that he cannot start the job yet due to the family emergency, she assumes Buck is lying to get out of working.\n\nUpon arriving, Buck deals with Cindy's coldness and finds himself cropped out of Bob and Cindy's wedding picture. Nevertheless, he quickly befriends Miles and Maizy, but Tia is brash and hostile as they engage in a battle of wills. When Buck meets her boyfriend Bug, he warns her that he is only interested in one thing and repeatedly thwarts her plans to sneak off with him.\n\nOver the next few days, Buck takes the kids bowling, makes enormous pancakes for Miles' birthday, removes the drunk party clown from the property, berates Maisy's school's assistant principal for critizing her behavior in class, and handles the laundry when the washing machine does not work.\n\nEventually, Tia exacts revenge on Buck for meddling in her relationship by interfering in his. She tricks Chanice into thinking that he is cheating on her with a neighbor. The next day, Chanice comes over to confront Buck about what she heard, but is furious to find Buck dancing with Marcie in the living room, so she dumps him.\n\nThe following weekend, concerned after Tia sneaks out to a party, Buck decides to find her rather than go to the track for a sure win. He begs Chanice to watch Miles and Maizy as he searches for Tia. \n\nAt the party, believing Bug is taking advantage of her in a bedroom, Buck forces the door open by drilling out the lock, but walks in on Bug with another girl. Finding Tia wandering the streets, she tearfully apologizes to him and acknowledges he was right about Bug. Buck then reveals that he is bound and gagged, in the trunk of his car. After intimidating him, Buck lets him out to apologize to her. When Bug is finally released, he threatens to sue Buck and retracts his apology, but flees in fear after Buck strikes him with a golf ball.\n\nAt home, Tia helps Buck reconcile with Chanice by admitting her lie and telling her that Buck would be a good husband and father. Buck also agrees to start his job at the garage, and he and Chanice reunite.\n\nCindy's father recovers and she and Bob return home from Indianapolis. Upon entering the house, Tia surprises her mother with a hug. The entire Russell family says farewell to Buck and Chanice as they leave for Chicago, with Buck and Tia exchanging a loving wave goodbye.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[John Candy]] as Buck Russell, a bachelor who babysits his brother's kids.\n* [[Jean Louisa Kelly]] as Tia Russell, the oldest daughter of Bob and Cindy.\n* [[Laurie Metcalf]] as Marcie Dahlgren-Frost, the neighbor of the Russells who lives across the street.\n* [[Jay Underwood]] as Bug, Tia's boyfriend.\n* [[Amy Madigan]] as Chanice Kobolowski, the girlfriend of Buck and proprietor of a tire shop.\n* [[Macaulay Culkin]] as Miles Russell, the only son of Bob and Cindy.\n* [[Gaby Hoffmann]] as Maizy Russell, the youngest daughter of Bob and Cindy.\n* [[Elaine Bromka]] as Cindy Russell, the wife of Bob.\n* [[Garrett M.

Filming began on January 4, 1989, in [[Chicago]]. The company decided to keep the production facilities and locations as close as possible. The vacant [[New Trier High School]] in [[Northfield, Illinois|Northfield]], [[Illinois]], was chosen for the production facility. Three of its gyms were converted into sound stages on which several sets were constructed including the two-leveled interior of the Russell House, Buck's bedroom, and smaller sets. The school was also equipped to suit the needs of the cast and crew behind-the-scenes, classrooms for the young actors, offices, dressing rooms, wardrobe department, editing facilities, a special effects shop, equipment storage areas, and a projection booth. Production designer [[John Corso]] began designing the sets in October 1988 and within seven weeks his construction crew of twelve carpenters and five painters began work on the two levels of the Russell house. The elementary school corridor, the boys' restroom, the principal's office, and a classroom were filmed at Wilmette's Romona Elementary School. A colonial-style house in [[Evanston, Illinois|Evanston]] was chosen for the exterior of the Russell house. The exteriors and practical locations were shot in Chicago, [[Cicero, Illinois|Cicero]], [[Skokie, Illinois|Skokie]], [[Northbrook, Illinois|Northbrook]], [[Wilmette, Illinois|Wilmette]], [[Winnetka, Illinois|Winnetka]], [[Glencoe, Illinois|Glencoe]], and [[Riverwoods, Illinois|Riverwoods]].\n\n==Reception==\n===Box office===\nThe film earned $8.8 million on its opening weekend in 1,804 theaters and was placed No. 1 at the box office.<ref>{{cite web|date=August 23, 1989|title='Uncle Buck' Is No. 1 At the Movie Box Office|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/08/23/movies/uncle-buck-is-no-1-at-the-movie-box-office.html?src=pm|access-date=October 22, 2011|work=[[The New York Times]]}}</ref> The film stayed in first place for three more weeks before being bumped down to second by ''[[Sea of Love (film)|Sea of Love]]''.
