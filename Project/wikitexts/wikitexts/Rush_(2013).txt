Lauda takes a large bank loan from Austria's [[Raiffeisen Bankengruppe|Raiffeisen Bank]] to buy his way into the [[British Racing Motors|BRM]] [[Formula One]] team, meeting teammate [[Clay Regazzoni]] for the first time. Meanwhile, [[Hesketh Racing]], the fledgling racing team Hunt drives for, enters Formula One. Lauda then joins [[Scuderia Ferrari]] with Regazzoni and wins his first [[1975 Formula One season|championship in 1975]]. Hesketh closes down after failing to secure a sponsor, but Hunt joins the [[McLaren]] team. During this time, Hunt marries supermodel [[Suzy Miller]], while Lauda develops a relationship with German socialite Marlene Knaus.\n\nThe [[1976 Formula One season|1976 season]] starts with Lauda dominating the first two races while Hunt struggles to catch up. Hunt wins the [[1976 Spanish Grand Prix|Spanish Grand Prix]], but is disqualified after a post-race inspection results in a ruling that the width of his car greater than permitted. Struggling to comply with F1 rules, McLaren suffers a series of racing setbacks, and Hunt's situation is further exacerbated when Suzy starts a relationship with actor [[Richard Burton]]. Following his divorce, Hunt regains his competitive spirit and, when his disqualification in Spain is overturned, the restored points put him into championship contention. Lauda marries Marlene in a private ceremony but begins to have concerns about the effects of his newfound happiness, worrying that he has become vulnerable as a racer, as he now has something to lose.\n\nOn the day of the [[1976 German Grand Prix|German Grand Prix]], Lauda calls a drivers' meeting, urging the F1 committee to cancel the race due to heavy rain on the notoriously dangerous [[N\u00fcrburgring|N\u00fcrburgring Nordschleife]]; the vote goes against cancellation after Hunt argues that Lauda is trying to personally benefit in competition by reducing the number of remaining races at a time where Lauda already has a significant points lead towards the season's championship. Most drivers start the race with wet weather tyres, which becomes a costly tactic due to most of the track quickly drying. They all change tyres during the second lap, pushing Hunt ahead of Lauda; the latter's attempts to catch up result in a suspension arm in his Ferrari breaking, causing a loss of control and crash of the car into an embankment, where it bursts into flames. Lauda is airlifted to hospital with third-degree burns to his head and face and internal burns to his lungs. For six weeks, Lauda is treated for his injuries while he watches Hunt dominate the races in his absence. Despite his doctor's orders, he decides to return to drive his Ferrari at the [[1976 Italian Grand Prix|Italian Grand Prix]], finishing fourth while Hunt fails to finish.\n\nThe 1976 season comes to a climax at the rain-soaked [[1976 Japanese Grand Prix|Japanese Grand Prix]]. Hunt's late rally in Lauda's absence has pulled him within three points of Lauda. At the end of the second lap, after his car has slid several times, Lauda returns to the pits and decides to retire from the race, considering it too dangerous and opting to stay with Marlene instead. This allows Hunt to win the championship if he can finish third or better. After facing stiff competition under gruelling conditions, tyre problems and a hand injury due to the gear shifter knob breaking, Hunt finishes third, winning the championship by a single point.\n\nHunt spends the rest of the year revelling with fame, sex and drugs, while Lauda takes an interest in flying private planes. At a private airfield in [[Bologna]], Lauda suggests to Hunt that he focus on the next racing season to defend his title, but Hunt argues that his glamorous lifestyle is the highlight of being world champion; furthermore, Lauda later realises that Hunt no longer feels he needs to prove himself to anyone. Hunt continues to race until his retirement in 1979, and becomes a motorsport broadcast commentator until his death in 1993 at the age of 45.\n\nLauda reflects on how their great rivalry and personality differences spurred each other on to their finest achievements, and states that Hunt was the only person he ever envied.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Daniel Br\u00fchl, Niki Lauda and Peter Morgan.jpg|thumb|right|Daniel Br\u00fchl, Niki Lauda and Peter Morgan at the premiere of ''Rush'' in Vienna, Austria.]]\n<!--- Cast and order per tombstone closing credits, roles per closing credits scroll --->\n{{div col}}\n* [[Chris Hemsworth]] as [[James Hunt]], a British F1 driver who races for [[McLaren]]\n* [[Daniel Br\u00fchl]] as [[Niki Lauda]], an Austrian F1 driver and Hunt's main rival who races for [[Scuderia Ferrari]]\n* [[Olivia Wilde]] as [[Suzy Miller]], Hunt's wife\n* [[Alexandra Maria Lara]] as Marlene Lauda, Niki Lauda's wife\n* [[Pierfrancesco Favino]] as [[Clay Regazzoni]], Niki Lauda's teammate\n* [[David Calder (actor)|David Calder]] as [[Louis Stanley]], chairman of BRM \n* [[Natalie Dormer]] as Nurse Gemma, a nurse who checks Hunt's injuries and is one of Hunt's girlfriends\n* [[Stephen Mangan]] as [[Alastair Caldwell]]\n* [[Christian McKay]] as [[Alexander Fermor-Hesketh, 3rd Baron Hesketh|Lord Hesketh]]\n* [[Alistair Petrie]] as [[Stirling Moss]] \n* [[Colin Stinton]] as [[Teddy Mayer]]\n* [[Julian Rhind-Tutt]] as Anthony 'Bubbles' Horsley\n{{Div col end}}\n\nHunt and Lauda appear as themselves, in the 1970s and 1980s, in [[archive footage]] at the end of the film, while Lauda is then seen for a few seconds in contemporary (2013) footage.\n\n==Production==\nThe film was shot on location in the [[United Kingdom]], [[Germany]] and [[Austria]].<ref name=official>{{cite web |title=Rush - Official Movie Site - 2013 |url=http://www.rushmovie.com/ |access-date=26 June 2012}}</ref> [[Blackbushe Airport]] in [[Hampshire]], the [[Snetterton Motor Racing Circuit|Snetterton]] ([[Norfolk]]), [[Cadwell Park]] ([[Lincolnshire]]), the former [[Crystal Palace circuit|Crystal Palace]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://filmlondon.org.uk/what-we-do/news/location_of_the_month_2013/september2013|title=Film London|work=filmlondon.org.uk}}</ref> and [[Brands Hatch]] ([[Kent]])<ref>{{cite web|author=Kent Film Office|url=http://kentfilmoffice.co.uk/2013/09/rush-2013/|title=Kent Film Office Rush Film Focus}}</ref> motor racing circuits in Britain, and at the [[N\u00fcrburgring]] in [[Germany]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.horncastlenews.co.uk/community/people/hollywood-director-gets-a-real-rush-filming-at-cadwell-1-3833649|title=Hollywood director gets a real Rush filming at Cadwell|newspaper=Horncastle News|publisher=Johnston Publishing|date=11 May 2012|access-date=11 May 2012}}</ref> Both vintage racing cars and replicas were used in the filming.\n\nThe financiers include [[H\u00fcrth]]-based action concept Film- und Stuntproduktion, Egoli Tossell Film, Revolution Films (GB) and [[Cross Creek Pictures]] (US).
