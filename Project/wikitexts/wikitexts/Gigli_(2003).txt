It was also one of the most expensive [[List of biggest box-office bombs|box-office bomb]]s in history, grossing $7.2 million against a $75.6 million budget. To date, it is the most recent film Brest directed.\n\n== Plot ==\nLarry Gigli is a low-ranking [[Los Angeles]] mobster who is not nearly as tough as he likes to act.  Louis, a higher-ranking member of Gigli's organization, commands him to [[Kidnapping|kidnap]] the [[Mental retardation|mentally challenged]] younger brother of a powerful [[federal prosecutor]] to use as a bargaining chip to save New York-based mob boss Starkman from prison.\n\nGigli successfully convinces the young man, Brian, to go off with him by promising to take him \"to the Baywatch\", apparently a reference to the [[Baywatch|television show of that name]], which seems to be Brian's singular obsession. Louis does not trust Gigli to get the job done right, so he hires a woman calling herself Ricki to take charge.\n\nGigli is attracted to Ricki, but he resents both Louis' lack of faith in him and having to take orders from a woman. He is also frustrated by Brian's insistence on going to \"the Baywatch\" and by the fact that Ricki is a [[lesbian]]. A suspicious detective comes to the apartment to question Gigli in reference to Brian's disappearance. He is further annoyed when his mother immediately bonds with Ricki and they team up to needle him.\n\nEvents take a darker turn when Gigli and Ricki receive orders to cut off Brian's thumb, something neither wants to do. Worse, her ex-girlfriend, Robin, shows up at the apartment, accusing Ricki of changing [[Sexual fluidity|sexual orientation]]. Robin attempts suicide by [[self-mutilation]] and is rushed to the hospital, where she survives. There, Gigli sneaks into the morgue and cuts off a corpse's thumb, which he sends to the prosecutor as Brian's. Gigli and Ricki go back to his apartment, where he confesses his love and they sleep together.\n\nThey are summoned to meet with the mob boss. Starkman reveals that he did not approve of the plan to kidnap a federal prosecutor's brother or cut off Brian's thumb. He nevertheless rages at them because it didn't match Brian's [[fingerprint]], and therefore not only failed to increase pressure on the prosecutor but even undermined their credibility.\n\nStarkman then kills Louis, in retaliation for the kidnapping and associated scrutiny by law enforcement. He is about to kill Ricki and Gigli, but she talks him out of it. She points out that only they know where Brian is and only they can silence and prevent him from revealing Starkman's organization's involvement in the kidnapping.\n\nThey leave Starkman's, decide to leave the mob, and discuss taking Brian back to where they found him. On the way, they discover a ''Baywatch''-like music video filming on the beach. Brian begs to be let off there and finally, they consent.\n\nGigli convinces Ricki to take his car to escape to parts unknown; but at the last minute, she returns to pick him up, and they leave town together.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Ben Affleck]] as Larry Gigli\n* [[Jennifer Lopez]] as Ricki/Rochelle\n* [[Justin Bartha]] as Brian\n* [[Lainie Kazan]] as Mrs. Gigli\n* [[Al Pacino]] as Starkman\n* [[Lenny Venito]] as Louis\n* [[Christopher Walken]] as Detective Stanley Jacobellis\n* Missy Crider as Robin\n* [[Terry Camilleri|Terrence Camilleri]] as Man in Dryer\n\n== Production ==\n[[Halle Berry]] was invited as the female lead before dropping due to scheduling conflicts with ''[[X2 (film)|X2]]'', being replaced with Jennifer Lopez, who signed in late 2001 for a reported $12 million.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Swanson |first=Tim |last2=Fleming |first2=Michael |date=2001-10-29 |title=Lopez is getting 'Gigli' |url=https://variety.com/2001/film/news/lopez-is-getting-gigli-1117855030/ |access-date=2019-05-03 |website=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |language=en}}</ref>\n\nGigli began shooting in Los Angeles on December 10, 2001.<ref>{{Cite web |date=Jun 17, 2012 |title=The Stax Report: Script Review of Gigli |url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2002/03/12/the-stax-report-script-review-of-gigli |access-date=June 1, 2022 |work=IGN}}</ref> The original ending featured Gigli being killed, but after negative response to a test screening, the ending was re-shot and re-edited.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Meslow |first=Scott |date=August 1, 2018 |title=15 Years Later, Was Gigli Really That Bad? |url=https://www.gq.com/story/was-gigli-really-that-bad |access-date=May 3, 2019 |website=GQ |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite magazine |last=Travers |first=Peter |date=August 1, 2003 |title=Gigli |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/movie-reviews/gigli-255819/ |magazine=[[Rolling Stone]] |language=en-US |access-date=May 3, 2019}}</ref>\n\n== Release and reception ==\n\n=== Critical reception ===\nOn [[Rotten Tomatoes]], ''Gigli'' has an approval rating of 6% based on 187 reviews with an average rating of 3.10/10.

Berardinelli gave it two stars, saying, \"This isn't a good film, but, when set alongside the likes of ''[[Dumb and Dumberer: When Harry Met Lloyd|Dumb and Dumberer]]'' and ''[[Legally Blonde 2: Red, White & Blonde|Legally Blonde 2]]'', Jen & Ben offer less pain.\"<ref>{{Cite web |last=Barardinelli |first=James |title=Gigli Movie Review |url=http://preview.reelviews.net/movies/g/gigli.html |website=ReelViews.net}}</ref>\n\n[[Joel Siegel]] of ''[[Good Morning America]]'' awarded the film with a \"D\" rating and stated in his review \"To qualify as a historic failure, a film needs a measure of pretension and all ''Gigli'' ever wanted to be was a romantic comedy.
