It follows a group of teenagers in a Northern California town who are forced to deal with their friend's murder of his girlfriend and the subsequent disposal of her body. Jimenez partially based the script on the [[Murder of Marcy Renee Conrad|1981 murder of Marcy Renee Conrad]] in [[Milpitas, California]].\n\nShot in [[Los Angeles]] in 1986, the film premiered that year at the [[Toronto International Film Festival]] before Island Pictures purchased it for distribution, theatrically releasing it in the United States in May 1987. Several critics praised the film's performances, and its subject matter resulted in several critics classifying it as a contemporary [[horror film]]. It was awarded Best Picture at the 1986 [[Independent Spirit Awards]].\n\nContemporary film scholars have noted ''River's Edge'' as an example of the \"killer kid\" film, as well as one of the most polarizing youth-oriented films of the 1980s.<ref name=history/>{{sfn|Levy|1999|p=286}} In a 2015 retrospective, ''[[Salon (website)|Salon]]'' deemed it \"the darkest teen film of all time.\"<ref name=salon/> The film has an original score by [[J\u00fcrgen Knieper]], as well as a soundtrack featuring songs from various punk and metal bands, including [[Slayer (band)|Slayer]], [[Fates Warning]], [[Agent Orange (band)|Agent Orange]], and the [[Wipers (band)|Wipers]].\n\n== Plot ==\n{{Long plot|date=March 2022}}\nIn [[Northern California]], as pre-teen Tim throws his sister's doll into a river, he sees a teenager, John, smoking on the other side, next to the naked corpse of his girlfriend Jamie. Tim returns home, where his older brother Matt and mother are searching for the doll. Matt's friend Layne arrives, and the two drive to meet Feck, a neurotic ex-[[Motorcycle club|biker]] and drug dealer, for [[marijuana]]. On the way, Layne recounts a party from the night before, where John and Jamie were arguing.\n\nAt school, Layne and Matt smoke with their friends Clarissa, Maggie, and Tony. Matt talks about wanting to run away to [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]], which Clarissa dismisses. John arrives and says he killed Jamie. Clarissa and Maggie leave for class, thinking he's joking. John brings Layne and Matt to see Jamie's body; Matt is disturbed, while Layne is focused on covering up the crime.\n\nThe group go see Jamie's body, with Layne's older brother Mike driving them there in his truck. Later, Clarissa calls Matt, but he is reluctant to talk to her. Meanwhile, Layne returns to the scene and pushes Jamie's body into the river. After noticing police cars near John's house, they drive to Feck's house, where John stays to hide out. Matt directs the police to the river, where they find Jamie's body. The police interrogate him, threatening to charge him as an [[Accessory (legal term)|accessory after the fact]]. Matt returns home and argues with his mother and her boyfriend. When he sees that Tim has defaced the grave marker for her lost doll that their sister made, Matt hits Tim in the face. Tim goes to his friend Moko's house and they go to Feck's to obtain a gun.\n\nIn the middle of the night, Layne, Clarissa and Matt drive to Tony's house, but Tony's father chases them off with a shotgun. Layne argues with Clarissa and kicks her out of his car. Matt gets out and walks with her. They stop at a convenience store and run into John and Feck. Tim and Moko break into Feck's house looking for a gun, but instead find his marijuana, which they use to get [[Substance intoxication|stoned]] and pass out. Matt and Clarissa talk in the park, where they discuss their conflicting feelings of grief and apathy over Jamie's murder. John and Feck go to the river's edge to drink, with Feck bringing along his [[sex doll|blow-up doll]], Ellie. Feck confesses to murdering his own girlfriend years earlier, despite having deeply loved her. John drunkenly brags about killing Jamie, recounting his strangling of her with a relish that disturbs Feck. Matt and Clarissa have sex in the park nearby, then fall asleep. Layne drives around town in a panic, compulsively taking pills.\n\nAt dawn, after John falls asleep on the riverbank, Feck shoots him in the head. He returns home, where Tim and Moko knock him out and steal his gun. The police find Layne and bring him in for questioning. At school, reporters interview Maggie and Tony, who seem dispassionate. The police arrest Feck in his house. The teenagers go to the river together. Matt admits to Layne he told the police that John murdered Jamie. Layne runs off and finds John's body. Tim arrives and points Feck's gun at Matt, threatening to kill Matt for hitting him the night before, but Matt dissuades him.\n\nThe police arrive and escort the teenagers and Tim away. In the hospital, Feck admits to killing John \"because there was no hope for him,\" and confesses to murdering his girlfriend. Matt, Clarissa, Tony, and Maggie attend Jamie's funeral, where they show emotion at seeing her for the last time.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Crispin Glover]] as Layne\n* [[Keanu Reeves]] as Matt\n* [[Ione Skye|Ione Skye Leitch]] as Clarissa\n* [[Daniel Roebuck]] as Samson 'John' Tollet\n* [[Dennis Hopper]] as Feck\n* [[Joshua John Miller]] as Tim\n* [[Roxana Zal]] as Maggie\n* [[Josh Richman]] as Tony\n* Phillip Brock as Mike\n* [[Tom Bower (actor)|Tom Bower]] as Detective Bennett\n* Yuzo Nishihara as Moko\n* [[Constance Forslund]] as Madeleine\n* [[Leo Rossi]] as Jim\n* [[Jim Metzler]] as Mr. Burkewaite\n* Richard Richcreek as Kevin\n* [[Taylor Negron]] as Checker\n* [[Danyi Deats]] as Jamie\n* [[Christopher Peters (actor)|Christopher Peters]] as Tom\n}}\n\n==Themes==\nFilm scholar [[Emanuel Levy]] writes that the film \"addresses the alienation and moral vacancy among American kids growing up in a drug-oriented, valueless culture. ''River's Edge'' has the disturbing quality of a collective fear\u2014the cherished, eagerly awaited adolescence is presented as confusing and vacuous.
