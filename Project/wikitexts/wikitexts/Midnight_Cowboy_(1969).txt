The film was written by [[Waldo Salt]], directed by [[John Schlesinger]], and stars [[Dustin Hoffman]] and [[Jon Voight]], with notable smaller roles being filled by [[Sylvia Miles]], [[John McGiver]], [[Brenda Vaccaro]], [[Bob Balaban]], [[Jennifer Salt]], and [[Barnard Hughes]]. Set in [[New York City]], ''Midnight Cowboy'' depicts the unlikely friendship between two hustlers: na\u00efve [[Male prostitution|sex worker]] Joe Buck (Voight), and ailing [[Confidence trickster|con man]] Enrico \"Ratso\" Rizzo (Hoffman).\n\nAt the [[42nd Academy Awards]], the film won three awards: [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]] and [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Adapted Screenplay]].

Initially unsuccessful, he manages to bed a middle-aged woman, Cass, in her posh [[Park Avenue]] apartment. The encounter ends badly as he gives ''her'' money after she is insulted when he requests payment and it is implied that she is a high class prostitute herself.\n\nJoe meets Enrico Salvatore \"Ratso\" Rizzo, a [[Confidence trick|con man]] with a limp who takes $20 from him for introducing him to a [[Procuring (prostitution)|pimp]]. After discovering that the alleged pimp is actually an unhinged [[Religious fanaticism|religious fanatic]], Joe flees in pursuit of Ratso but cannot find him. Joe spends his days wandering the city and sitting in his hotel room. Soon broke, he is locked out of his hotel room and his belongings are impounded.\n\nJoe tries to make money by receiving [[oral sex]] from a young man in a movie theater, but learns after the act that the young man has no money. Joe threatens him and asks for his watch, but eventually lets him go unharmed. The next day, Joe spots Ratso and angrily shakes him down. Ratso offers to share the apartment in a condemned building where he is [[squatting]]. Joe reluctantly accepts his offer, and they begin a \"business relationship\" as hustlers. As they develop a friendship, Ratso's health grows steadily worse.\n\nIn a series of [[Flashback (narrative)|flashbacks]], Joe's grandmother raises him after his mother abandons him. He also has a tragic relationship with a girl named Annie. The film has successive flashbacks to an experience in which he and Annie were jumped while naked in a parked car and raped by a gang of cowboys. The rape affects Annie's mental stability to the point that she becomes insane and is driven away in the back of an ambulance taking her to a psychiatric institution. The viewer gains more information about the experience as the flashbacks accumulate.\n\nRatso tells Joe his father was an illiterate Italian immigrant [[shoeshiner]] whose job led to a bad back and lung damage from long-term exposure to [[shoe polish]]. Ratso learned shoeshining from his father but considers it degrading and generally refuses to do it, although he does shine Joe's cowboy boots to help him attract clients. Ratso harbors hopes of moving to [[Miami]], shown in daydreams in which he and Joe frolic carefree on a beach and are surrounded by dozens of adoring middle-aged women.\n\nA Warhol-like filmmaker and an extrovert female artist approach Joe in a diner, taking his [[Instant camera|Polaroid]] photograph and handing him an invitation to a [[The Factory|Warhol-esque]] art event (which incorporates actual [[Warhol superstars]], including [[Viva (actress)|Viva]], [[Isabelle Collin Dufresne|Ultra Violet]], [[Taylor Mead]], [[Joe Dallesandro]] and the Warhol-related filmmaker [[Paul Morrissey]]<ref>Blake Gopnik, Warhol:  A Life as Art London: Allen Lane. March 5, 2020. {{ISBN|978-0-241-00338-1}} p. 629</ref>). Joe and Ratso attend, but Ratso's poor health and hygiene attract unwanted attention from several guests. Joe mistakes a [[Joint (cannabis)|joint]] for a cigarette and starts to hallucinate after taking several puffs, along with \"uppers\" he is offered. He leaves the party with Shirley, a [[socialite]] who agrees to pay him $20 for spending the night, but Joe cannot perform sexually. They play ''[[Scribbage]]'' together and the resulting [[Word play|wordplay]] leads Shirley to suggest that Joe may be gay; suddenly he is able to perform. The next morning, she sets up her female friend as Joe's next client and it appears that his career is finally taking off.\n\nWhen Joe returns home, Ratso is bedridden and feverish. He refuses medical help and begs Joe to put him on a bus to [[Florida]]. Desperate, Joe picks up a man in an amusement arcade and robs him during a violent encounter in the man's hotel room where Joe brutally beats the man. Joe buys bus tickets with the money he robbed from the man so he and Ratso can board a bus to Florida. During the trip, Ratso's health deteriorates further as he becomes [[Urinary incontinence|incontinent]] and sweat-drenched.\n\nAt a rest stop, Joe buys new clothing for Ratso and himself and discards his cowboy outfit. On the bus, Joe muses that there must be easier ways to earn a living than hustling, and tells Ratso he plans to get a regular job in Florida. When Ratso fails to respond, Joe realizes that he has died. The driver tells Joe there is nothing to do but continue to Miami and asks Joe to close Ratso's eyelids. Joe, with tears welling in his eyes, sits with his arm around his dead friend, alone.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Dustin Hoffman]] as Enrico Salvatore \"Ratso\" Rizzo\n* [[Jon Voight]] as Joe Buck\n* [[Sylvia Miles]] as Cass\n* [[John McGiver]] as Mr. O'Daniel\n* [[Brenda Vaccaro]] as Shirley\n* [[Barnard Hughes]] as Towny\n* [[Ruth White (actress)|Ruth White]] as Sally Buck\n* [[Jennifer Salt]] as Annie\n* [[Gilman Rankin]] as Woodsy Niles\n* [[Georgann Johnson]] as Rich Lady\n* [[Anthony Holland (actor)|Anthony Holland]] as TV Bishop\n* [[Bob Balaban]] as Young Student\n* [[Viva (actress)|Viva]] as Gretel McAlbertson, the [[Warhol]]-like [[The Factory]] party/happening giver\n* Paul Rossilli (aka Gastone Rossilli) as Hansel McAlbertson, The Factory party/happening filmmaker\n* Craig Carrington as Charlie Dealer\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\nThe opening scenes were filmed in [[Big Spring, Texas]] in 1968.
