The film stars an [[ensemble cast]] that includes [[Mila Kunis]], [[Kristen Bell]], [[Kathryn Hahn]], [[Jay Hernandez]], [[Annie Mumolo]], [[Jada Pinkett Smith]], and [[Christina Applegate]].\n\n[[Principal photography]] began on January 11, 2016, in [[New Orleans]]. The film premiered on July 19, 2016, in [[New York City]] and was theatrically released on July 29, 2016, by [[STX Entertainment]]. It received mixed reviews from critics and grossed over $183 million worldwide, becoming the first film from STX to gross $100 million domestically.\n\nA sequel, titled ''[[A Bad Moms Christmas]]'', was released on November 1, 2017.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2017/09/bad-moms-christmas-trailer-susan-sarandon-justin-hartley-1202162573/|title='A Bad Moms Christmas' Trailer: Santa Lap Dancing, Susan Sarandon & Naked Justin Hartley|website=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|date=September 6, 2017|access-date=September 15, 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nAmy Mitchell is a 32-year-old woman who is married and is living in the [[Chicago]] [[suburbs]] with her kids, Jane and Dylan, overworked and overcommitted. She is a sales rep for a coffee company, prepares healthful lunches for her children, does their homework, goes to all of their extracurricular activities, and is active in the [[Parent-Teacher Association#PTA|PTA]], run by the domineering Gwendolyn James and her cronies, Stacy and Vicky.\n\nWhen Amy catches her husband Mike cheating on her with a [[Webcam model|camgirl]], she kicks him out and attempts to keep everything together. However, after a particularly stressful day, Amy publicly quits the PTA due to Gwendolyn's overzealous bake sale. At a nearby bar, she meets Carla, a laid-back, sexually active single mom, and Kiki, a stay-at-home mom of four who admires Amy's dissent. Amy and Carla are irritated to see that Kiki's husband is domineering, expecting her to take care of all the kids and the house without help, while Amy and Kiki are taken aback by Carla's very hands-off approach to parenting.\n\nThe trio embark on an all-night bender, inspiring Amy to loosen up with her kids: she takes them for rides in Mike's sportscar, gets them lunch from [[Arby's]], forces Dylan to fend for himself to prevent him from being lazy and entitled, and takes the overachieving and constantly stressed Jane for a spa day. Amy herself wants to start dating but is inexperienced as she had a shotgun marriage at 20. She ultimately strikes up a conversation with Jessie a handsome widower at the school who's had a crush on her, leading to them kissing. The next morning she receives a text from him showing interest.\n\nWhen Amy brings store-bought donut holes to the bake sale, she draws the ire of Gwendolyn, who uses her PTA authority to get Jane benched from the soccer team. Angered, Amy decides to run for PTA president against her. A meet-and-greet at Amy's draws only one visitor, who tells them Gwendolyn has launched a rival party at her own house, catered by [[Martha Stewart]]. In spite of this, the other moms, and Martha, swiftly abandon Gwendolyn's party when it becomes clear that she intends to lecture them all evening, leading to a successful party at Amy's house. Afterwards it is revealed that Carla had \u201cbooty texted\u201d Jessie from Amy\u2019s phone. After explaining she hadn't sent it, he asks Amy if she wants him to leave, which she doesn't, prompting them to sleep together.\n\nMeanwhile, Gwendolyn responds to Amy\u2019s antics by putting joints in Jane's locker, framing her and getting her kicked out of all extracurricular activities. Not only do Jane and Dylan both go to stay with Mike (who has agreed to an amicable divorce), but Amy loses her job because she's taken much time off. Unable to cope with her sadness, she becomes reclusive and [[Depression (mood)|depressed]].\n\nA despondent Amy stays home during the PTA election but is fired up by Carla and Kiki (who finally stands up to her husband, ordering him to deal with everything alone until after the election). At the event, Amy gives an inspiring speech about how overworked moms need to take time off, do fewer and less stressful events, and most importantly, allow themselves to make mistakes. She wins by a landslide and winds up comforting a devastated Gwendolyn, who reveals she's going through a divorce as well and bossing around the PTA was her outlet for venting her anger.\n\nWeeks later, Amy's approach has led to positive changes: Jane has been reinstated to the soccer team and is stressing out less, Dylan is applying himself, Kiki makes her husband help out with the kids, Carla is more responsible and hands-on, Gwendolyn is kinder with everyone, and all of the other moms, including Stacy and Vicky, are feeling more energized. Amy herself has gotten her job back with much better compensation after her boss sees how much he had taken her for granted, and she continues to see Jessie. Gwendolyn invites Amy, Carla, and Kiki for a day of fun on her husband's private jet.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Mila Kunis]] as Amy Mitchell\n* [[Kristen Bell]] as Kiki\n* [[Kathryn Hahn]] as Carla Dunkler\n* [[Christina Applegate]] as Gwendolyn James\n* [[Jada Pinkett Smith]] as Stacy\n* [[Annie Mumolo]] as Vicky\n* [[Jay Hernandez]] as Jessie Harkness\n* [[Oona Laurence]] as Jane Mitchell\n* [[Emjay Anthony]] as Dylan Mitchell\n* [[David Walton (actor)|David Walton]] as Mike Mitchell\n* [[Clark Duke]] as Dale Kipler\n* [[Wanda Sykes]] as Dr. Elizabeth Karl\n* [[Wendell Pierce]] as Principal Daryl Burr\n* [[J.
