It is based on the novel of the same name by [[Nora Johnson]], who co-wrote the screenplay with her father, [[Nunnally Johnson]].\n\nThe original story was inspired in part by Nora Johnson's own experiences as a schoolgirl, as well as by a real-life incident involving singer [[Tony Bennett]] and two teenaged fans.\n\n==Plot==\nIn early 1960s New York City, concert pianist Henry Orient ([[Peter Sellers]]) pursues an affair with a married woman, Stella Dunnworthy ([[Paula Prentiss]]), while two adolescent private-school girls, Valerie \"Val\" Boyd ([[Tippy Walker]]) and Marian \"Gil\" Gilbert ([[Merrie Spaeth]]), stalk him and write their fantasies about him in a diary. Orient's paranoia leads him to believe that the two girls, who seem to pop up everywhere he goes, are spies sent by his would-be mistress's husband.\n\nIn reality, fourteen-year-old Val, the bright and imaginative daughter of wealthy international trade expert Frank Boyd ([[Tom Bosley]]) and his unfaithful, snobbish wife Isabel ([[Angela Lansbury]]), has developed a teenage crush on Henry after seeing him in concert, and has involved her best friend Gil. Although Gil's parents are divorced, she lives a relatively happy and stable life in a townhouse in the city with her mother and her mother's also-divorced female friend, while Val, whose parents are still married (albeit unhappily), sees a psychiatrist daily and lives with paid caretakers while her parents travel the world. \n \nVal's parents return for Christmas, and Val becomes concerned that her mother Isabel is having an extramarital affair with a young pianist. Val's interference leads her mother to find and read Val's diary. Isabel chastises Val and seeks out Henry, ostensibly to tell him to stay away from her underage daughter. The cheating Isabel and the womanizing Henry are quickly attracted to each other and begin an affair, which Val and Gil accidentally discover while stalking Henry outside his apartment. Val's devastation and Isabel's attempts to cover up her own behavior cause Frank to figure out what happened. Frank and Isabel separate, while the paranoid Henry flees the country.  However, positive changes for Val result as Frank, who unlike Isabel genuinely cares about his daughter, resolves to stop traveling so much and establish a real home where he and Val can spend more time together. In the end, Val and Gil have matured and moved on from fantasy play to makeup, fashion and boys their own age.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Peter Sellers]] as Henry Orient\n* [[Tippy Walker]] as Valerie \"Val\" Campbell Boyd\n* [[Merrie Spaeth]] as Marian \"Gil\" Gilbert\n* [[Angela Lansbury]] as Isabel Boyd\n* [[Tom Bosley]] as Frank Boyd\n* [[Paula Prentiss]] as Stella Dunnworthy\n* [[Phyllis Thaxter]] as Mrs. Avis Gilbert\n* [[Bibi Osterwald]] as Erica \"Boothy\" Booth\n* [[John Fiedler]] as Sidney\n* [[Al Lewis (actor)|Al Lewis]] as Store Owner\n* [[Peter Duchin]] as Joe Daniels\n* Fred Stewart as Doctor\n* [[Philippa Bevans]] as Emma Hambler\n* Jane Buchanan as Lillian Kafritz\n{{div col end}}\nThis was the first film appearance for both Tippy Walker and Merrie Spaeth.\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nThe novel was published in 1958.

New York Times 10 Aug 1958: BR18.</ref>\n\nThe pianist's unusual surname, \"Orient\", came about because Nora Johnson based the character on [[Oscar Levant]], a real-life concert pianist, raconteur, and film actor on whom she had a crush as a teenager.<ref name=colapinto>{{cite magazine |last=Colapinto |first=John |author-link=John Colapinto |date=2012-04-03 |title=A Star is Born, Lost, and Found |url=http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/a-star-is-born-lost-and-found |magazine=[[The New Yorker]] |location=[[New York City]] |access-date=2015-12-12 }}</ref> Since the word \"levant\" means Orient in French (literally the direction from which the sun rises), the name is a play on words.  In the film, several allusions to the pianist's unusual name occur when his two teenage fans put on [[Conical Asian hat|Chinese conical hats]], address their idol as \"Oriental Henry,\" [[kowtow]] to an Asian-style altar, and adopt vaguely Japanese-sounding names for themselves.\n\nNora Johnson's father Nunnally was a noted screenwriter but he said for three years, \"it never \noccurred to me that it could be filmed, because I couldn't think of two girls to do it. \"<ref name=\"Johnson p 451\">Johnson p 451</ref> Johnson said his point of view changed when he saw [[Hayley Mills]] in a film and felt it could be done with Mills and [[Patty Duke]].

Chicago Daily Tribune 7 Apr 1962: a6.</ref>\n\nJohnson says his daughter had written a script herself but felt it did not work as she was too inexperienced as a dramatist and too faithful to the book. He purchased the screen rights from her and they agreed to split the screenplay fee fifty-fifty.<ref>Johnson p 452-453</ref>\n\nUnited Artists were interested in buying the script. [[Henry Koster]], who had directed several comedies written by Johnson at Fox, read the script and loved it and pressured [[Richard Zanuck]] at Fox to buy it; Zanuck was keen but wanted his father [[Darryl Zanuck|Daryl]] to read it first. Daryl did not get around to reading it and Johnson decided to sell to United Artists. This upset Daryl Zanuck who felt he had been misled and ended the formerly close relationship between him and Johnson.<ref>Johnson p 370-371</ref>\n\nIn April 1963, George Roy Hill announced that he and producer Jerome Hellman had bought the screen rights and would film it for their Pan Arts company which had a deal with United Artists.<ref>BY WAY OF REPORT: 'Orient' in Manhattan --Other Film Matters Of 'Charlemagne'\nBy A.

Los Angeles Times 4 Aug 1963: d8.</ref>\n\nAccording to a 2012 article in ''[[The New Yorker]]'' by [[John Colapinto]], director George Roy Hill handpicked Walker from hundreds of actresses who auditioned for the role of \"Val\". The filmmakers were so impressed with her performance that they reshaped the film during editing to focus more on her character, and shot the scene of her walking through a snowy [[Central Park]] months after production had wrapped. According to Colapinto, in the 2000s Walker revealed through a series of posts on [[IMDb]] that she and Hill fell in love during the filming, and that the relationship lasted throughout most of Walker's senior year in high school, despite the fact that Hill was married with children and, at age 44, was nearly 30 years older than Walker. Walker claimed that the resulting Hollywood gossip made others reluctant to cast her and contributed to her decision to stop acting in the early 1970s.<ref name=colapinto />\n\n[[Eddie Duchin]]'s son [[Peter Duchin|Peter]] made his acting debut in the film.<ref>Peter Duchin Gets Film Role In 'World of Henry Orient'\nNew York Times 28 June 1963: 18.</ref>\n\n===Shooting===\nFilming started on July 29, 1963, at the Long Island studios at Roosevelt Field. It wrapped that October.\n\nJohnson said Hill made some notable contributions to the film including \"those runs through the park. He used trampolines and some kind of slow motion, and it gave it a real quality of soaring childhood, released, all the way through. He's one of these dedicated directors, one that takes trouble.

[[Pia Zadora]] also appeared in the role of a student. The show ran for 80 performances and closed on December 31, 1967, receiving less than stellar reviews.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.ibdb.com/broadway-production/2963 |title=''Henry, Sweet Henry'' |website=IBDB.com |publisher=[[Internet Broadway Database]] }}</ref> [[William Goldman]], in his study of the 1967\u201368 theater year, ''[[The Season: A Candid Look at Broadway]]'', claimed that the musical was of high quality but was old fashioned, and \"had the misfortune\" to open just a week after all the critics \"were overcome by ''[[Hair (musical)|Hair]]'',\" which had a modern sound.\n\nAlthough the show was not a success, one of its performers, [[Alice Playten]], received a 1968 [[Theatre World Award]], and was nominated for a [[Tony Award]] for \"Best Featured Actress in a Musical\" for playing the role of Kafritz, which was enlarged substantially for the play.
