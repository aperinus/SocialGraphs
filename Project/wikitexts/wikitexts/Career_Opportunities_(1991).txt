It was written and co-produced by [[John Hughes (filmmaker)|John Hughes]] and directed by [[Bryan Gordon]]. In the film, Whaley plays Jim Dodge, a persuasive but irresponsible young man who lands a job as an overnight janitor at a local [[Target Corporation|Target]] store. One evening after hours, he finds himself alone with the affluent but mistreated Josie McClellan (Connelly).\n\nHughes chose Gordon to direct his screenplay after he was impressed with one of Gordon's short films. The film was shot at a Target store located outside [[Atlanta]]. The film grossed $11 million at the box office, and received mostly negative reviews from critics. Hughes distanced himself from the film.\n\n==Plot==\nTwenty-one-year-old Jim Dodge is a self-proclaimed \"people person\" and dreamer, perceived as lazy and good-for-nothing. After being fired from numerous low-paying jobs, Jim is given the choice by his father, Bud Dodge, to either land a job at the local [[Target Corporation|Target]] or be sent to St. Louis to work for his uncle.\n\nJim is hired as a night cleanup boy at Target. On his first shift at his new job, Jim is locked alone in the store by his boss, the head custodian, who leaves him there until his shift ends at 7 am. He encounters beautiful Josie McClellan, a stereotypical \"spoiled rich girl\" whom he has known all his life. Josie had spent the past several hours asleep in a dressing room after backing out of shoplifting some merchandise in a half-hearted attempt to run away from her abusive father, Roger Roy McClellan.\n\nJosie and Jim begin to connect with each other, realizing they are not so different. They begin to form a romantic relationship, and proceed to enjoy the freedom of having such a large store to themselves. Josie, having $52,000 in her purse, convinces Jim to run away with her to Los Angeles as soon as they leave the store in the morning. Meanwhile, Roger teams up with the town sheriff to search for his runaway daughter all night.\n\nThings become complicated when two incompetent crooks, Nestor Pyle and Gil Kinney, break in and hold the two hostage. Eventually, Josie seduces one of the crooks and convinces him to take her with them after robbing the store. While the criminals are loading stolen merchandise into their car, Josie jumps into the front seat and drives away, leaving the two men stranded in the parking lot. Meanwhile, in the building, Jim loads up a shotgun found in the head custodian's locker and tricks Nestor and Gil by luring them to the back of the store and holding them at gunpoint.\n\nIn the morning, the sheriff arrives and stumbles upon the two crooks, having been tied up by Jim. Jim and Josie run away and are then seen lounging next to a pool in Hollywood.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Frank Whaley]] as Jim Dodge\n* [[Jennifer Connelly]] as Josie McClellan\n* [[Dermot Mulroney]] as Nestor Pyle\n* [[Kieran Mulroney]] as Gil Kinney\n* [[John M.

John Hughes approached him to direct after having been impressed by Gordon's short film, ''[[Ray's Male Heterosexual Dance Hall]]'', which won the [[Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Best Live Action Short Film|Best Live Short]] in 1987. Gordon said he took the job of ''Career Opportunities'' to \"learn about myself and how to make a movie.\"<ref>{{cite news|title=Handling the Pressure|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=November 18, 1990|page=T32}}</ref>\n\nFrank Whaley, cast in the lead, said his character was \"a little akin to [[Ferris Bueller]].\"<ref>{{cite news|title=Whaley Had Long Apprenticeship Before 'Opportunities' Knocked|last=Mills|first=Bart|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=April 6, 1991|page=F2}}</ref>\n\nAfter a nationwide search, the filmmakers chose the rural area of [[Monroe, Georgia]], for the film's locale.<ref name=\"afi\"/> The [[Target Corporation|Target]] store was number T-378, and was located at 4000 Covington Highway in [[Decatur, Georgia|Decatur]], just outside of [[Atlanta]]. The store had formerly been a [[Richway]] location, which was renovated after Target's [[Southeastern United States|Southeast]] expansion in the late 1980s. Whaley went to the location with the director before shooting and \"looked for bits. So all those little montages, that was stuff that we came up with.\" He says he and Connelly \"got along really well and, people remember certain shots from that movie.\"<ref name=\"av\"/> The store has since closed.\n\n[[Principal photography]] began on November 13, 1989, with an estimated seven-week filming schedule. It was shot over the [[Christmas]] holiday shopping season; a writer at the [[American Film Institute]] noted that \"Some store employees remained after hours, and several were chosen to be background actors, while others restocked departments utilized by the production crew.\"<ref name=\"afi\"/> Shooting at night \"does something to your psyche\", said Whaley.<ref name=\"av\"/> The filmmakers created an additional \"Garden of Eden\" set within the store, designed for an emotional scene between the film's leads.<ref name=\"afi\">{{cite web|url=https://catalog.afi.com/Catalog/MovieDetails/58794|title=AFI Catalog \u2013 ''Career Opportunities''|publisher=[[American Film Institute]]|access-date=September 13, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190913043401/https://catalog.afi.com/Catalog/MovieDetails/58794|archive-date=September 13, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe film was released in the United Kingdom as ''One Wild Night''.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Career Opportunities (1991)|url=https://www2.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b7b4b551d|access-date=2022-02-23|publisher=[[British Film Institute]]}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n===Box office===\n''Career Opportunities'' was a box office disappointment at the time of its release.

He says he tried to take his name off the film but Universal refused in the wake of the success of ''[[Home Alone]]''. \"Suddenly I'm a commodity\", he said. \"If ''Home Alone'' hadn't come out my name wouldn't be on ''Career Opportunities'' four times.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/08/04/magazine/him-alone.html|title=Him Alone: John Hughes, prolific auteur of the under-aged, is a veritable studio unto himself.

He added:\n\n<blockquote>I think if they made that movie today it would be kind of cool, but it just lacked a little bit of the reverence of other movies written by John Hughes. The soundtrack was certainly classic John Hughes fare. I mean, I happen to think it's kind of a cool movie. I think it's different than his other movies, and I think that casting me was a daring move. [Laughs.] Because I didn't sort of fit into that mold. I played it a little bit different. I was just\u2026 slightly off. And I think that might've been part of the demise of the whole thing.<ref name=\"av\">{{cite web |website= [[The A.V.
