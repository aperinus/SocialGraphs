A Love Story''''' is a 1993 [[United States|American]] [[romantic comedy]] [[film]] written and directed by [[Albert Pyun]]. It stars [[Andrew \"Dice\" Clay]] as Ed \"The Brainsmasher\" Malloy and [[Teri Hatcher]] as Samantha Crain.<ref>{{cite news|title=Review: 'Brain Smasher\u2026 \u2013 A Love Story'|url=https://variety.com/1992/film/reviews/brain-smasher-a-love-story-1200431363/|accessdate=23 March 2014|newspaper=Variety|date=December 31, 1992}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nEd Malloy, a tough bouncer from [[Portland, Oregon]], is dragged into a twisted web of lies, magic and kung fu.  Samantha Crain is a glamorous [[supermodel]] who has everything\u2014except for true love.  Her sister Cammy is an \"[[Indiana Jones (character)|Indiana Jones]]\" styled botanist in search of a very rare lotus flower.\n\nMeanwhile, a group of Chinese [[Shaolin monks]] with high-flying martial arts powers are in search of the [[lotus flower|lotus]] as well, because they believe that whoever eats its petals will gain infinite powers. (They also indignantly protest, \"We are NOT [[ninjas]]!\" when anyone mischaracterizes them.)\n\nSamantha receives a package from her sister, who is trying to escape back to [[America]], with the Shaolin monks hot on her tail. The package is the rare lotus flower. It's arranged for the Crain sisters to meet in Portland.  But the monks intervene, and the Crain sisters flee separately. While racing through the streets of Portland, Samantha seeks refuge in a bar that employs Ed Malloy ([[Andrew \"Dice\" Clay]]), who is notoriously nicknamed \"The Brainsmasher.\"\n\nMalloy sees the monks and decides to help Samantha. While on the chase from the monks (and occasionally, Malloy's mother), the two fall in love.\n\nDesperate, the monks capture Malloy and hold him for ransom: His life for the lotus. The Crain sisters agree, but then double-cross the monks, and Malloy saves the day by living up to his 'Brainsmasher' moniker.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Andrew \"Dice\" Clay]] as Ed \"The Brainsmasher\" Malloy\n* [[Teri Hatcher]] as Samantha Crain\n* [[Deborah Van Valkenburgh]] as Cammy Crain\n* [[Yuji Okumoto]] as Wu, Leader of The Shaolin Monks\n* Peter Kwong as Red Monk\n* [[Brion James]] as Detective Brown\n* [[Tim Thomerson]] as Detective Black\n* [[Charles Rocket]] as Detective Jones\n* [[Nicholas Guest]] as Detective Smith\n* Ralph Monaco as Pops Malloy\n* [[Liz Sheridan]] as Ma Malloy\n* Dorothy Dells as Miss Bellows\n* [[Dee Booher]] as Bertha\n* Galen Schrick as Jimmy Romeo\n* Steve Tancora as Bob Brisco\n* Russ Fast as Ted\n* Kelsi Pollard as Ted's Date\n* Karrie Grove as Waitress At Bar None\n* [[Lin Shaye]] as Makeup Artist\n* [[Sonia Satra]] as Model #1\n* Anahit Minasyan as Model #2\n* Nichole McAuley as Veronica (uncredited)\n}}\n\n==Release==\n\nThe movie was released directly to videocassette in 1993 by Vidmark Entertainment.
