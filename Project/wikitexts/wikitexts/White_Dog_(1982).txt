The film depicts the struggle of a dog trainer named Keys ([[Paul Winfield]]), who is [[African Americans|black]], trying to retrain a stray dog found by a young actress ([[Kristy McNichol]]), that is a \"white dog\"\u2014a dog trained to make vicious attacks upon, and to kill, any black person. Fuller uses the film as a platform to deliver a message against racism as it examines the question of whether racism is a treatable problem or an incurable condition.\n\nThe film's theatrical release was suppressed for a week in the United States by [[Paramount Pictures]] out of concern over negative press after rumors began circulating that the film was racist. Prior to the date, it was released internationally in France in July 1982. Its first official American home video release came in December 2008 when [[The Criterion Collection]] released the original uncut film to DVD.<ref>[https://www.criterion.com/films/861-white-dog The Criterion Collection]</ref><ref>[https://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/35575/white-dog-criterion-collection/ DVD Talk]</ref>\n\nCritics praised the film's hard-line look at racism and Fuller's use of [[melodrama]] and metaphors to present his argument, and its somewhat disheartening ending that leaves the impression that while racism is learned, it cannot be cured. Reviewers consistently questioned the film's lack of wide release in the United States when it was completed and applauded its belated release by Criterion.\n\n==Plot==\nWhile driving through the Los Angeles hills at night, white actress Julie Sawyer accidentally runs over a stray White Shepherd dog. After the veterinarian treats him, Julie takes him home while trying to find his owners. A rapist breaks into her house and tries to attack her, but the dog protects her. She decides to adopt him, against the wishes of her boyfriend Roland Graele. Unbeknownst to her, the dog was trained by a white [[racist]] to attack [[black people]] on sight.  The dog sneaks out of the house, and kills a black truck driver. Later, Julie takes the dog to work with her, and he mauls a black actress on the set.\n\nJulie takes the dog to a trainer, Carruthers, who tells her to euthanize the dog. Another dog trainer, Keys, who is black, decides to try to retrain the dog. He dons protective gear and keeps the dog in a large enclosure, taking him out on a chain and exposing himself to the dog each day and making sure he is the only one to feed or care for the dog.\n\nThe dog escapes and kills an elderly black man in a church. Keys recovers him, and opts not to turn him over to authorities to continue the training, over Julie's protests. He warns her that the training has reached a tipping point, where the dog might be cured or go insane. He believes that curing the dog will discourage white racists from training dogs like this.\n\nEventually, the dog becomes friendly towards Keys. Julie confronts the dog's original owner, who has come to claim him. She angrily tells him the dog has been cured by a black person in front of his grandchildren who knew the dog to be a loving pet. Just as Julie and Keys celebrate their victory, the dog, without warning, turns its attention to Carruthers and attacks him. To save his employer's life, Keys is forced to shoot and kill the dog.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Kristy McNichol]] as Julie Sawyer\n* [[Paul Winfield]] as Keys\n* [[Burl Ives]] as Carruthers\n* [[Jameson Parker]] as Roland Grale\n* [[Parley Baer]] as Wilber Hull\n\n==Production==\n''White Dog'''s roots lie with a 1970 autobiographical novel written by [[Romain Gary]] of the same name.<ref name=\"Chicago Tribune\">{{cite journal |title=Fuller's fable 'White Dog' has its day at last |first=Dave |last=Kehr |journal=[[Chicago Tribune]] |date=November 29, 1991 |page=C |issn=1085-6706 }}</ref> The story was purchased for use by Paramount in 1975, with [[Curtis Hanson]] selected to write the screenplay and [[Roman Polanski]] hired to direct. Before shooting commenced, Polanski was charged with rape and fled the country, leaving the production in limbo.<ref name=\"Every Dog\" /> Over a span of six years, the project was given to various writers and producers, who all focused on the stray dog story from Gary's original work.<ref name=\"Every Dog\" /><ref name=\"Hoberman\" /> Gary's activist wife was replaced in the script with a young, unmarried actress because Paramount wanted to contrast the dog's random attacks with a loving relationship between the protagonist and the dog. Paramount executives noted that they wanted a ''\"[[Jaws (film)|Jaws]]'' with paws\" and indicated that they wanted any racial elements to be downplayed. In one memo, the company noted: \"Given the organic elements of this story, it is imperative that we never overtly address through attitude or statement the issue of racism per se.\"<ref name=\"Every Dog\" />\n\nBy 1981, Gary's wife, and then Gary himself, had both committed [[suicide]]. At the same time, [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] was under threat of strikes by both the [[Writers Guild of America|Writers']] and [[Directors Guild of America|Directors']] Guilds.<ref name=\"Every Dog\" /><ref name=\"Hoberman\" /> Needing enough films to carry the studio through in case the strikes happened, ''White Dog'' was one of 13 films considered to be far enough along to be completable in a short time frame. With a push from [[Michael Eisner]], ''White Dog'' was one of seven that Paramount put on a fast track for production.<ref name=\"paramount\">{{cite news|title=How Paramount 'Seven' Fared at the Box Office|first=Aljean|last=Harmetz|newspaper=New York Times|date=23 May 1983|page= C13}}</ref> Eisner pushed for the film to be one of the selected ones because of its social message that hate was learned. Producer [[Jon Davison]] was less certain and, early on, he questioned how the film was being marketed.<ref name=\"Every Dog\" /> Hanson, back on board as the film's screenwriter, suggested that [[Samuel Fuller]] be named the film's director as he felt Fuller was the only one available with the experience needed to complete the film on such a short schedule and with a low budget, while still doing so responsibly with regard to the sensitive material.<ref name=\"Every Dog\" /><ref name=\"Hoberman\">{{cite web |url=http://www.criterion.com/current/posts/847 |title=White Dog: Sam Fuller Unmuzzled |first=J |last=Hoberman |publisher=[[The Criterion Collection]] |date=November 28, 2008 |access-date=January 26, 2009 }}</ref> Davison agreed after visiting Fuller and seeing Fuller act out how he would shoot the film.<ref name=\"Every Dog\">{{cite journal |title=Every Dog Has Its Day: The Muzzling of Samuel Fuller's White Dog |first=Lisa |last=Dombrowski |journal=[[Film Comment]] |date=Nov\u2013Dec 2008 |volume=44 |issue=6 |pages=46\u201349}}</ref>\n\nFuller readily agreed, having focused much of his own career on racial issues.<ref name=\"Every Dog\" /> Already familiar with the novel and with the concept of \"white dogs\", he was tasked with \"reconceptualizing\" the film to have the conflict depicted in the book occur within the dog rather than the people. In an earlier ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' magazine interview, Fuller stated that viewers would \"see a dog slowly go insane and then come back to sanity.\"<ref name=\"Hoberman\" /> Before filming began, the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] (NAACP), the Black Anti-Defamation Coalition (BADC), and other civil-rights leaders began voicing concerns that the film would spur racial violence. In an editorial in the ''[[Los Angeles Times]],'' Robert Price, executive director of the BADC, criticized the studio for producing the film based on a book by a white man and using a primarily white cast and crew, rather than producing the film with African Americans in key positions. He also considered Gary's work to be a \"second-rate novel\" and questioned its use when \"bookshelves are laden with quality novels by black writers who explore the same social and psychological areas with far more subtlety?\"<ref name=\"Every Dog\" />\n\nFuller, however, was confident in his work and the idea that the film would be strongly anti-racist, particularly with the changes he had made to the original work. The original novel's hate-filled Muslim black trainer, who had deliberately retrained the dog to attack white people, was converted into the character of Keys, who genuinely wished to cure the animal. Fuller also changed the novel's original ending into a more pessimistic film ending.<ref name=\"Every Dog\" /><ref name=\"Hoberman\" /> The film was shot in only forty-five days at a cost of US$7 million. Five white German Shepherd Dogs played the unnamed central character.<ref name=\"Hoberman\" />\n\n{{quote box |width=25em | bgcolor=#c6dbf7 |align=right  | quote=Shelve the film without letting anyone see it?

Crippens, the vice president and stage manager of the local [[PBS]] affiliate.<ref name=\"New York Times\" /><ref name=\"Every Dog\" /><ref name=\"Hoberman\" /> In the end, they walked away with different views of the film. Crippens did not find the film to have any racist connotations, while Edwards found it inflammatory and felt it should not have been made, particularly not during that year, when [[Atlanta murders of 1979\u20131981|a series of murders of black children was occurring in Atlanta]].<ref name=\"Every Dog\" /> The two men provided a write-up of their views for the studio executives, which were passed to Davison along with warnings that the studio feared a film boycott.<ref name=\"Every Dog\" /> But Fuller was neither told of these discussions, nor given the notes, until two weeks before filming was slated to conclude.<ref name=\"Every Dog\" /> Known for being a staunch [[integrationist]] and for his regularly giving black actors non-stereotypical roles, Fuller was furious, finding the studio's actions insulting.<ref name=\"Every Dog\" /> He reportedly had both representatives banned from the set afterwards, though he did integrate some of the suggested changes into the film.<ref name=\"New York Times\" /><ref name=\"Every Dog\" />\n\nThe film was completed in 1981, but Paramount was hesitant to release the film out of continuing concerns that the film would be misconstrued.<ref name=\"Chicago Tribune\" /><ref name=\"Every Dog\" /><ref name=\"Hoberman\" /> Though no one from the organization had viewed the completed film, the NAACP threatened boycotts.<ref name=\"Every Dog\" /> In early 1982, the studio finally held a preview screening in [[Seattle, Washington|Seattle]] and later, in August, in [[Denver, Colorado|Denver]], with mixed responses.<ref name=\"AFI\">{{AFI film|59435|White Dog}} Retrieved June 10, 2020.</ref> It was finally released in the US at five [[Detroit, Michigan|Detroit]] theatres on November 12, 1982, for just one week, with no trailer, no poster and no promotion at all. It did no business and was shelved as uncommercial by Paramount. Dumbfounded and hurt by the film's shelving, Fuller moved to France and never directed another American film.<ref name=\"AFI\" />\n\nLater in April 1987, during an interview held in Milan, Fuller stated that Paramount shelved the film also because they feared negative reactions from the [[Ku Klux Klan]].<ref>{{cite news |last1=Marmiroli |first1=Adriana |title=Sam Fuller l'implacabile |url=https://archivio.unita.news/issue/1987/04/07 |access-date=June 10, 2020 |work=[[l'Unit\u00e0]] |date=April 7, 1987 |location=Italy |page=13 |language=it |format=PDF|issn=0391-7002}}</ref>\n\n==Themes==\n''White Dog'' is a \"blunt, highly cinematic parable about race relations\" that questions whether racism is a curable mental illness or learned behavior, or if it is an untreatable disease.<ref name=\"Chicago Tribune\" /><ref name=\"Entertainment Weekly\" /> The unnamed white German Shepherd is the metaphor of racism, with his radically contrasting moments of innocent, typical dog behavior when not around black persons, and his snarling viciousness when he sees a target.<ref name=\"Chicago Tribune\" /><ref name=\"Slant Magazine\" /> Paul Winfield's character Keys, who believes he can help the dog unlearn this behavior, represents the view that racism can be unlearned.<ref name=\"Chicago Tribune\" /><ref name=\"Video Business\" /> Keys's attempts to reprogram the dog become a \"bold literalization of the race war,\"<ref name=\"Slant Magazine\" /> and as the film progresses Keys becomes obsessed with the idea that he can cure the dog. Much like [[Ahab (Moby-Dick)|Captain Ahab]], he declares that if he fails with this dog, he will find another and another until he succeeds.<ref name=\"Hoberman Book\" /> Keys's counterpart, Carruthers, a white trainer, believes the dog is irredeemable and should be killed, representing the view that racism cannot be cured.<ref name=\"New York Times\">{{cite journal |title=White Dog 1982 |first=Charles |last=Taylor |journal=New York Times |location=New York City, New York |date=November 2, 2008 |page=MT. 16 }}</ref>\n\n{{blockquote|The snarling dog, its white fur stained with bright red stage blood, becomes a typically imposing, outscale Fuller image \u2013 the embodiment of snarling, irrational and implacable hatred.

Hoberman argues that the film \"naturalizes racism in an unnatural way\" in the contrasting depictions of white characters horrified by the dog's behavior, and black characters who grimly accept it as a fact of life.<ref name=\"Hoberman Book\" /> The film's ending has been argued to emphasize Fuller's own view that racism is something that is learned, but that once learned is a \"poison\" that can never truly \"be banished from those it infects.\" But on the other hand, the dog is actually cured of attacking blacks, but not cured of his own hatred since the last thing he does is to attack a white man, and without being provoked into doing so at that. The ending implies therefore that it is hatred (and not racism) that cannot be banished from those it infects.<ref name=\"New York Times\" />\n\nIn Romain Gary's original novel, this was not the story that was told\u2014the dog started to attack white people because a black man embittered by white racism deliberately retrained him to do so.<ref>{{cite web|title=White Dog|work=[[Kirkus Reviews]]|url=https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/romain-gary-3/white-dog/}}</ref>\n\n==Distribution==\nParamount felt the film was too controversial for release, giving it only a few preview showings and a one-week run in Detroit before shelving it.<ref name=\"Chicago Tribune\" /><ref name=\"Hoberman\" /> The film's first theatrical release occurred in France on July 7, 1982.

It received positive reviews in both countries.<ref name=\"Every Dog\" /> Lisa Dombrowski of ''[[Film Comment]]'' notes, \"In the end, Sam Fuller's ''White Dog'' was muzzled by a collision of historically specific economic and political interests, as support for freedom of expression took a back seat to Paramount's bottom line and the NAACP's ongoing battles with Hollywood over representation and employment. A Sam Fuller thriller was simply not the kind of antiracist picture that a major studio knew how to market in 1981 or that African-American organizations wanted Hollywood to make at the time.\"<ref name=\"Every Dog\" />\n\nIn 1983, ''White Dog'' was edited for a direct-to-television broadcast and made available for purchase by cable channels. The following year, NBC bought broadcast rights for $2.5 million and slated the film to air during the February [[sweeps]], then canceled the broadcast two days later due to pressure from the continuing NAACP campaign and concerns of a negative reaction by both viewers and advertisers.<ref name=\"Every Dog\" /> The film was eventually aired on other cable channels such as [[HBO]], [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]], and [[The Movie Channel]] sporadically and without fanfare.<ref name=\"Chicago Tribune\" /><ref name=\"Entertainment Weekly\" /><ref name=\"Hoberman\" /> It was also infrequently screened at independent film houses and film festivals.<ref name=\"Chicago Tribune\" />\n\nIn 1991, Michael Schlesinger, then head of Paramount's repertory division, convinced his bosses to let him book the film as part of a complete Fuller retrospective at New York's [[Film Forum]]. He did ''not'' tell them that it would be a full one-week booking, instead of the usual single day, and billed as its New York premiere. The film received rave reviews and crowds packed the theatre; at year's end, [[The Village Voice]] called it the best film of the year. Demands to play the film increased. After some deliberation, Paramount said he could continue to accept dates provided that there would be no \"racial\" outcry; if there were, he would have to stop. He accepted the deal, and it successfully played revival houses in the rest of the country without incident.\n\nIts first official American home video release came on December 2, 2008, when [[The Criterion Collection]] released the film to DVD.<ref name=\"Video Business\" /><ref name=\"Criterion Collection\" /> The DVD has the uncut version of the film, video interviews from the original producer and writer, an interview with the trainer of the dog used in the film, and a booklet of critical essays.<ref name=\"Criterion Collection\">{{cite web |url=http://www.criterion.com/asp/release.asp?id=455 |title=White Dog (1982) |publisher=[[The Criterion Collection]] |access-date=January 12, 2009 }}</ref> The [[National Society of Film Critics]] bestowed the distributor with a special film heritage award for releasing the film.<ref>{{cite press release |url=http://www.criterion.com/current/posts/999 |title=Critics Honor White Dog Release |publisher=[[The Criterion Collection]] |date=January 6, 2009 |access-date=January 12, 2009 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.today.com/news/national-society-film-critics-picks-bashir-wbna28508310 |title=National Society of Film Critics picks Bashir |publisher=[[Today.com]] |date=January 5, 2009 |access-date=January 12, 2009 }}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\nBecause of its limited release, it only grossed $46,509.<ref name=\"BoxOfficeMojo\">{{cite web |url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=whitedog.htm |title=White Dog |publisher=[[Box Office Mojo]] |access-date=January 26, 2009 }}</ref> The film was praised by critics upon its release, particularly for its treatment of racism and Fuller's directorial talents.
