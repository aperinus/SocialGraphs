It is directed by [[Richard Lester]] from a screenplay by [[George MacDonald Fraser]], and produced by [[Ilya Salkind]]. It stars [[Michael York]], [[Oliver Reed]], [[Frank Finlay]], and [[Richard Chamberlain]] as the titular musketeers, with [[Raquel Welch]], [[Geraldine Chaplin]], [[Jean-Pierre Cassel]], [[Charlton Heston]], [[Faye Dunaway]], [[Christopher Lee]], [[Simon Ward]], [[Georges Wilson]] and [[Spike Milligan]].\n\nThe film adheres closely to the novel, and also injects a fair amount of humor. It was originally proposed in the 1960s as a vehicle for [[The Beatles]], whom Lester had directed in ''[[A Hard Day's Night (film)|A Hard Day's Night]]'' and ''[[Help! (film)|Help!]]''. It was shot by [[David Watkin (cinematographer)|David Watkin]], with an eye for period detail, in [[Madrid]] and [[Segovia]], [[Spain]]. The fight scenes were choreographed by master swordsman [[William Hobbs (choreographer)|William Hobbs]]. The musical score was composed by [[Michel Legrand]].\n\n''The Three Musketeers'' premiered in France on December 11, 1973. It was both a critical and commercial success and was nominated for several awards, including five [[BAFTA Awards|BAFTAs]]. Raquel Welch won a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress \u2013 Motion Picture Comedy or Musical|Golden Globe]] for her performance. A sequel shot back-to-back with its predecessor, [[The Four Musketeers (1974 film)|''The Four Musketeers'']], was released the following year.\n\n==Plot==\nHaving learned [[swordsmanship]] from his father, the young country bumpkin [[d'Artagnan]] arrives in [[Paris]] with dreams of becoming a king's musketeer. Unaccustomed to the city life, he makes a number of clumsy ''faux pas''. First he finds himself insulted, knocked out and robbed by the [[Comte de Rochefort]], an agent of [[Cardinal Richelieu]], and once in Paris comes into conflict with three musketeers, [[Athos (character)|Athos]], [[Porthos]], and [[Aramis]], each of whom challenges him to a duel for some accidental insult or embarrassment. As the first of these duels is about to begin, Jussac arrives with five additional swordsmen of Cardinal Richelieu's guards. D'Artagnan sides with the musketeers in the ensuing street fight and becomes their ally in opposition to the Cardinal, who wishes to increase his already considerable power over the king, [[Louis XIII of France|Louis XIII]]. D'Artagnan also begins an affair with his landlord's wife, Constance Bonacieux, who is dressmaker to the Queen, [[Anne of Austria]].\n\nMeanwhile, the [[George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham|Duke of Buckingham]], former lover of the Queen, turns up and asks for something in remembrance of her; she gives him a necklace with twelve settings of diamonds, a gift from her husband. From the Queen's treacherous lady-in-waiting, the Cardinal learns of the rendezvous and suggests to the none-too-bright King to throw a ball in his wife's honor, and request she wear the diamonds he gave her. The Cardinal also sends his agent [[Milady de Winter]] to England, who seduces the Duke and steals two of the necklace's diamonds.\n\nMeanwhile, the Queen has confided her troubles in Constance, who asks d'Artagnan to ride to England and get back the diamonds. D'Artagnan and the three musketeers set out, but on the way the Cardinal's men attack them. Only d'Artagnan and his servant make it through to Buckingham, where they discover the loss of two of the diamond settings. The Duke replaces the two settings, and d'Artagnan races back to Paris. Porthos, Athos, and Aramis, wounded but not dead as d'Artagnan had feared, aid the delivery of the complete necklace to the Queen, saving the royal couple from the embarrassment which the Cardinal had plotted.\n\n[[Comte de Troisville|Captain Tr\u00e9ville]] eventually inducts d'Artagnan into the Musketeers of the King's Guard.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Michael York]] as [[d'Artagnan]]\n* [[Oliver Reed]] as [[Athos (fictional character)|Athos]]\n* [[Frank Finlay]] as [[Porthos]] / O'Reilly\n* [[Richard Chamberlain]] as [[Aramis]]\n* [[Raquel Welch]] as Constance Bonacieux\n* [[Jean-Pierre Cassel]] as King [[Louis XIII of France]] {{small|(dubbed by [[Richard Briers]])}}\n* [[Geraldine Chaplin]] as [[Anne of Austria]]\n* [[Charlton Heston]] as [[Cardinal Richelieu]]\n* [[Faye Dunaway]] as [[Milady de Winter]]\n* [[Christopher Lee]] as the [[Comte de Rochefort|Count De Rochefort]]\n* [[Simon Ward]] as the [[George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham|Duke of Buckingham]]\n* [[Spike Milligan]] as M.

The Beatles idea fell by the wayside but Lester stayed.<ref name=\"fraser\"/> It would be Lester's first film in five years, although he had been busy directing commercials and had sought finance for other projects in that time, including an adaptation of the novel ''[[Flashman (novel)|Flashman]]'' by [[George MacDonald Fraser]].<ref name=\"back\"/>\n\nLester says he had \"never heard of\" the Salkinds. They asked him if he was interested in doing ''The Three Musketeers'' and asked if he had read it. Lester said \"Yes, I have read it, everybody's read it\". He read \"the first 200 pages, got excited and said yes\".<ref name=\"back\"/>\n\nLester said the producers \"wanted it to be a sexy film and they wanted it to be with big sexy stars\" such as [[Leonard Whiting]] and [[Ursula Andress]]. He said \"I just didn't say no to anything in the early stages\" and that the \"die was cast\" when he was allowed to hire [[George MacDonald Fraser]] to write the script.<ref>Soderbergh p109</ref>\n\nFraser had never written a script before but thought that ''Flashman'' had the tone he was going for. In late 1972 Lester offered Fraser the job.<ref name=\"Soderbergh109\">Soderbergh p 109</ref> According to Fraser, Lester originally said he wanted to make a four-hour film and cast Richard Chamberlain as Aramis. It was later decided to turn the script into two films.<ref name=\"fraser\">George MacDonald Fraser, ''The Light's On at Signpost'', HarperCollins 2002 p1-16</ref> Fraser says he wrote them as two films, but no one told the actors.<ref name=\"Buckley\">At the Movies: Costs of making 'Superman' go up, up and away.\nBuckley, Tom.

She announced she would instead make a film ''''Decline and Fall of a Very Nice Lady''.<ref>MOVIE CALL SHEET: Bart Signs Paramout Pact\nMurphy, Mary. [[Los Angeles Times]] 8 Aug 1973: d13.</ref> However Welch wound up rejoining the film.\n\n===Filming===\nThe film was originally meant to be shot in Hungary. However after visiting the country Lester felt this would not be feasible, in part because of restrictions of the government on filming.<ref>Soderbergh p110</ref>\n\nThe movie ended up being shot in Spain<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.movie-locations.com/movies/t/Three-Musketeers-1973.php|title=Filming Locations for The Three Musketeers (1973), in Spain.|website=The Worldwide Guide to Movie Locations}}</ref> over seventeen weeks. Locations included [[Segovia]], where Lester had made [[A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum (film)|''A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum'']].\n\nLester says the producers assembled twenty minutes of footage and sold the film to [[20th Century Fox]].<ref>Sodeberg p 110</ref>\n\nLester says Michel Legrand \"had about a week and a half\" to write the music.<ref>Soderbergh p 113</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n===Critical response===\nOn [[Rotten Tomatoes]] the film has an approval rating of 83% based on reviews from 12 critics.<ref>{{cite web |title= The Three Musketeers (1973) |url= https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1021340_three_musketeers |website= [[Rotten Tomatoes]] |access-date= November 26, 2019 }}</ref>\n\n[[Variety (magazine)|''Variety'']] gave the film a positive review, and wrote: \"The Three Musketeers take very well to Richard Lester\u2019s provocative version that does not send it up but does add comedy to this adventure tale\". They praised the various performances, but noted that although Dunaway is underused she gets to make up for it in the sequel.<ref>{{cite news|title= The Three Musketeers - The Queen's Diamonds |work= Variety|date=1972-12-31|url= https://variety.com/1972/film/reviews/the-three-musketeers-the-queen-s-diamonds-1200422900/ |access-date= 2010-10-11 }}</ref>\n\n[[Vincent Canby]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote: \"Mr. Lester seems almost exclusively concerned with action, preferably comic, and one gets the impression after a while that he and his fencing masters labored too long in choreographing the elaborate duels.

Screenwriter George MacDonald Fraser records the evening, \"That not all the actors knew about this I didn't discover until the Paris premiere, which began with a dinner for the company at Fouquet's and concluded in the small hours with a deafening concert in what appeared to be the cellar of some ancient Parisian structure (the Hotel de Ville, I think).  Charlton Heston knew, for when we discussed it before dinner he shrugged philosophically and remarked: 'Two for the price of one.'\"<ref>{{cite book |last1=Fraser |first1=George MacDonald |title=The Light's on at Signpost |date=2002 |publisher=HarperCollins |location=London |isbn=0007136463 |page=8 |edition=First }}</ref>  This incensed the actors and crew, since they were being paid for one film, and their original contracts made no mention of a second feature, resulting in lawsuits being filed to receive compensation for salaries associated with the sequel.\n\nThis led to the [[Screen Actors Guild]] requiring all future actors' contracts to include what has become known as the \"Salkind clause\" (named after producers [[Alexander Salkind|Alexander]] and [[Ilya Salkind]]), which stipulates that single productions cannot be split into film instalments without prior contractual agreement.<ref>{{cite magazine|title= Franchise This|magazine= Entertainment Weekly|date=2004-04-09|url= http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,607128,00.html|access-date=2010-10-10|first=Tom|last=Russo}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title= FILM VIEW; THE SALKIND HEROES WEAR RED AND FLY HIGH|work= The New York Times|date=1983-07-17|url= https://www.nytimes.com/1983/07/17/movies/film-view-the-salkind-heroes-wear-red-and-fly-high.html|access-date=2010-10-10|first=Sandra|last=Salmans}}</ref>\n\n==Sequels==\n\n''[[The Four Musketeers (1974 film)|The Four Musketeers]]'' was released the following year, with footage originally intended to combine with this film's to be part of a much longer film.\n\nIn 1989, much of the cast and crew of the original returned to film ''[[The Return of the Musketeers]]'', loosely based on Dumas' 1845 novel ''[[Twenty Years After]]''.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n* {{cite book |title= Getting away with it : or, The further adventures of the luckiest bastard you ever saw |url= https://archive.org/details/gettingawaywithi00sode |url-access= registration |last1= Soderbergh |first1= Steven |last2= Lester |first2= Richard |year= 1999 |publisher= Faber and Faber |isbn= 9780571190256 }}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wikiquote|The Three Musketeers (1973 film)}}\n* {{IMDb title|0072281}}\n* {{Amg movie|49690}}\n* {{tcmdb title|id=22501}}\n* {{AFI film|55291}}\n* {{rotten-tomatoes|1021340_three_musketeers}}\n\n{{Richard Lester}}\n{{George MacDonald Fraser}}\n{{The Three Musketeers}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Three Musketeers, The}}\n[[Category:1970s historical adventure films]]\n[[Category:American historical adventure films]]\n[[Category:American swashbuckler films]]\n[[Category:British historical adventure films]]\n[[Category:British swashbuckler films]]\n[[Category:Cultural depictions of Cardinal Richelieu]]\n[[Category:Cultural depictions of Louis XIII]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Michel Legrand]]\n[[Category:Films based on The Three Musketeers]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Richard Lester]]\n[[Category:Films featuring a Best Musical or Comedy Actress Golden Globe winning performance]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Madrid]]\n[[Category:Films set in France]]\n[[Category:Films set in Paris]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by George MacDonald Fraser]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Segovia]]\n[[Category:1970s English-language films]]\n[[Category:1970s American films]]\n[[Category:1970s British films]]"}]}}}}
