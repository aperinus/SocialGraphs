The film is based on historical figures but fictionalizes their story in dramatized form. It was nominated for three [[Academy Awards]], and won a [[Golden Globe Awards|Golden Globe Award]] for ''Best Film Promoting International Understanding.''  Film historians have said that the movie was one of the first major [[Western (genre)|Westerns]] since the Second World War to portray the [[Native Americans in the United States|Indians]] sympathetically.<ref>John H. Lenihan, ''Showdown: Confronting Modern America in the Western Film'', Urbana: University of Illinois Press, 1980, pp. 55\u201389.</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n[[Tom Jeffords]] comes across a wounded, 14-year-old [[Apache]] boy dying from [[buckshot]] wounds in his back. Jeffords gives the boy water and treats his wounds. The boy's tribesmen appear and are initially hostile, but decide to let Jeffords go free. However, when a group of gold prospectors approaches, the Apache gag Jeffords and tie him to a tree. Helpless, he watches as they attack the prospectors and torture the survivors. The warriors then let him go but warn him not to enter Apache territory again.\n\nWhen Jeffords returns to Tucson, he encounters a prospector who escaped the ambush. He corrects a man's exaggerated account of the attack, but Ben Slade is incredulous and does not see why Jeffords did not kill the Apache boy. Instead, Jeffords learns the Apache language and customs and plans to go to [[Cochise]]'s stronghold on behalf of his friend, Milt, who is in charge of the mail service in Tucson. Jeffords enters the Apache stronghold and begins a parley with Cochise, who agrees to let the couriers through. Jeffords meets a young Apache girl, Sonseeahray, and falls in love.\n\nA few of Cochise's warriors attack an army wagon train and kill the survivors. The townsfolk nearly lynch Jeffords as a traitor before he is saved by General [[Oliver Otis Howard]] who recruits Jeffords to negotiate peace with Cochise. Howard, the \"Christian General\" condemns racism, saying that the Bible \"says nothing about pigmentation of the skin.\u201d Jeffords makes a peace treaty with Cochise, but a group led by [[Geronimo]], oppose the treaty and leave the stronghold. When these renegades ambush a stagecoach, Jeffords rides off to seek help from Cochise and the stagecoach is saved.\n\nJeffords and Sonseeahray marry in an Apache ceremony and have several days of tranquility. Later, Ben Slade's son spins a story to Jeffords and Cochise about two of his horses stolen by Cochise's people. Cochise says that his people did not take them and doubts his story, as he knows the boy's father is an Apache hater. They then decide to go along with the boy up the canyon but are ambushed by the boy's father and a gang of men from Tucson. Jeffords is badly wounded and Sonseeahray is killed but Cochise kills most of the men, including Ben Slade. Cochise forbids Jeffords to retaliate, saying that the ambush was not done by the military and that Geronimo broke the peace no less than Slade and his men, and that peace must be maintained. Jeffords rides off with the belief that \"the death of Sonseeahray had put a seal upon the peace, and from that day on wherever I went, in the cities, among the Apaches and in the mountains, I always remembered, my wife was with me.\u201d\n\n==Cast==\n* [[James Stewart]] as Tom Jeffords\n* [[Jeff Chandler]] (in [[brownface]]) as Cochise\n* [[Debra Paget]] as Sonseeahray\n* [[Basil Ruysdael]] as Gen.

Before we found Chandler we were even considering [[Ezio Pinza]].\"<ref>{{Cite news|title=Steigers Act Out Breakup of a Marriage: Breakup Acted Out by Steigers|author=Loynd, Ray.|date=June 27, 1969|work=Los Angeles Times|page=d1}}</ref>\n\nJeff Chandler was cast in May 1949 on the basis of his performance in ''[[Sword in the Desert]]''. He was working in several radio series at the time, ''Michael Shayne'' and ''Our Miss Brooks'', and had to be written out of them for several weeks.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Big Chief Cochise Set; Sidney to Direct 'Keys;' Trevor 'Package' Looms|author=Schallert, Edwin|date=May 18, 1949|work=Los Angeles Times|page=A7}}</ref>\n\nFilming started on June 6, 1949. It was primarily shot on location in northern [[Arizona]], approximately 30 miles south of [[Flagstaff, Arizona|Flagstaff]]. Apaches from the Whiteriver agency on the [[Fort Apache Indian Reservation]] played themselves.<ref>Frank Daugherty, \"Story of Apache Treaty Being Filmed in Arizona\", ''[[The Christian Science Monitor]]'' July 29, 1949: 5.</ref> [[Debra Paget]] was only 15 years old when she played the love interest to 42-year-old [[James Stewart]]. Canadian Mohawk actor [[Jay Silverheels]] portrayed [[Geronimo]].\n\nThe movie was based on the 558-page novel ''Blood Brother'' (1947) by [[Elliott Arnold]], which told the story of the peace agreement between the Apache leader [[Cochise]] and the U.S. Army, 1855\u20131874. The studio employed nearly 240 Indians from Arizona's [[Fort Apache Indian Reservation]]; many location scenes were shot in [[Sedona, Arizona]]. (The story of [[Cochise]] actually occurred in what is now the [[Dragoon Mountains]] in the Douglas Ranger District of the [[Coronado National Forest]] in southeastern Arizona.)  The studio attempted to portray Apache customs in the film, like the Social Dance and the Girl's Sunrise Ceremony (the girl's puberty rite). For the character of [[Cochise]], director Daves eliminated the traditional style of broken English and replaced it with conventional English so that whites and Indians would sound alike.<ref>{{cite book|last=Aleiss|first=Angela|title=Making the White Man's Indian: Native Americans and Hollywood Movies|year=2005|publisher=Praeger|location=Westport, Conn./London|isbn=027598396X|url=https://archive.org/details/makingwhitemansi00alei}}</ref>\n\n==Portrayal of Indians==\nAlthough many westerns of the pre-World War II period portrayed American Indians as hostile to the European settlers, others did show Indians in a positive light. ''Broken Arrow'', however, is noteworthy for being one of the first post-war westerns to portray Native Americans in a balanced, sympathetic way. However, most of the Indians were played by European American actors, with Brooklyn-born Jeff Chandler portraying [[Apache]] leader [[Cochise]]. An exception was that Native Canadian Mohawk actor [[Jay Silverheels]] was noted for his role as [[Geronimo]] in the film.<ref>{{cite web| url= http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2013/07/04/geronimo-hollywoods-favorite-native-over-100-years-150287| title= Geronimo: Hollywood's Favorite Native for Over 100 Years| access-date= April 3, 2016| archive-date= July 9, 2016| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20160709111211/http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2013/07/04/geronimo-hollywoods-favorite-native-over-100-years-150287| url-status= dead}}</ref>\n\nSome scholars have said that the film appealed to an ideal of tolerance and racial equality that would influence later westerns and indicate Hollywood's response to the Indian's evolving role in American society.<ref>Angela Aleiss, \"Hollywood Addresses Postwar Assimilation: Indian/White Attitudes in ''Broken Arrow''\", ''American Indian Culture and Research Journal'', 11(1), pp. 67\u201379.</ref> ''Chronicle of the Cinema'' praised the film: \"Based on verifiable fact, it faithfully evokes the historical relationship between Cochise and Jeffords, marking a historical rehabilitation of Indians in the cinema.\"<ref>Robyn Karney (editor), ''Chronicle of the Cinema''; London: Dorling Kindersley, 1995; p.&nbsp;400.</ref>\n\nIn 1950, [[Rosebud Yellow Robe]], a Native American folklorist, educator, and author, was hired by [[Twentieth-Century Fox]] to undertake a national tour to promote the film.
