Although it is a fictional film loosely based on real events of [[James Jesus Angleton]], it is advertised as telling the untold story of the birth of [[counterintelligence]] in the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA).\n\nThe film was released on December 22, 2006, to mixed reviews. It grossed $100 million against an estimated $80 million production budget.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1961, senior CIA officer Edward Wilson receives a photograph and tape recording after the failed [[Bay of Pigs Invasion]], and obtains a coded signal from \"Cardinal.\u201d Then the film flashes back to 1939.\n\nAttending [[Yale University]], Edward is invited to join [[Skull and Bones]]. During his initiation, he reveals that he discovered but never read the suicide note left by his father, Thomas Wilson, an admiral who was to be named [[United States Secretary of the Navy|Secretary of the Navy]] until his loyalties were questioned. [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] agent Sam Murach recruits Edward to expose professor Dr. Fredericks as a [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]] spy, leading to Fredericks' resignation. Edward dates a fellow Yale student he meets in the library named Laura, who is hearing impaired. He's starting to fall for Laura when he meets Margaret \u201cClover\u201d Russell, the sister of a fellow Skull and Bones brother, and daughter of the head of the anti-Interventionist [[America First Committee]], at a party in 1940. General Bill Sullivan offers Edward a post in London, in what would later become one of the first branches of the [[Office of Strategic Services|OSS]].\n\nClover's brother John tells Edward that Clover is pregnant with Edward's child; Laura, reading their lips, leaves. Edward marries Clover and accepts Sullivan\u2019s offer, leaving his new wife for London where he finds Dr. Fredericks, actually a [[Secret Intelligence Service|British intelligence]] operative who recommended Edward for [[Counterintelligence|counter-espionage]] training. [[Special Operations Executive]] officer Arch Cummings tells Edward that Fredericks' indiscreet liaisons pose a security risk; Fredericks refuses to retire quietly and is killed.\n\nIn post-war Berlin, Edward collaborates with Soviet counterpart \"Ulysses\". Learning Clover is having an affair, Edward sleeps with his interpreter Hanna Schiller; he realizes she is a Soviet operative and she is killed. After six years, Edward returns home to a distant Clover, now calling herself Margaret, and helps Sullivan form the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] with colleague Richard Hayes under Phillip Allen.\n\nMonitoring Soviet activity in Central America, Edward recognizes Ulysses, who sends him an agent\u2019s severed finger after the CIA unleashes locusts on a Soviet fronted coffee company. Valentin Mironov convinces Edward he is a high-ranking [[KGB]] defector. Edward encounters Laura and rekindles their romance, until Margaret confronts him with compromising photographs, and he ends the affair. Another Soviet defector claims he is the real Mironov and the imposter is a double-agent. Tortured and administered liquid [[LSD]], he ridicules his interrogators before hurling himself out a window. The first defector, watching with Edward, offers to take LSD to prove his innocence, but Edward declines.\n\nAt Yale, his son Edward Jr. also joins Skull and Bones and is approached by the CIA. Despite Margaret\u2019s pleas, Edward Jr. joins the agency. When he overhears Edward and Hayes discuss the upcoming Bay of Pigs invasion, Edward warns him to remain silent. Margaret moves out.\n\nIn 1961, the tape recording leads CIA specialists to deduce the photograph may have been taken in [[L\u00e9opoldville]]. There, Edward realizes the photograph and tape are of his son. He meets Ulysses, who plays the unedited tape of Edward Jr. repeating the conversation he overheard to his lover Miriam, a Soviet spy, unknowingly leaking the upcoming invasion. Encouraged to spy for the Soviets in exchange for his son\u2019s protection, Edward confronts his son, who refuses to believe Miriam is a spy.\n\nEdward exposes Mironov as a double-agent and Cummings as a co-conspirator, who flees to Moscow. Ulysses\u2019 aide is revealed to be \u201cCardinal,\u201d Edward's mole. Edward and Margaret arrive separately in the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congo]] for Edward Jr.'s wedding to Miriam; flying to the ceremony, Miriam is thrown out of a plane. Edward informs his son of her death and denies responsibility, but is shaken to learn she was pregnant.\n\nEdward meets Hayes at the new CIA [[George Bush Center for Intelligence|headquarters]], noting the lobby\u2019s Biblical inscription: \"And ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free ([[John 8:32]]).\" Allen is resigning in disgrace, and the [[President of the United States|President]] has named Hayes the new [[Director of the Central Intelligence Agency|Director of the CIA]], and appoints Edward the first head of [[CIA Counterintelligence|counter-intelligence]].\n\nEdward finally reads his father\u2019s suicide note, learning that he had betrayed his country but urged his son to live a life of decency and truth. Edward burns the note, and leaves his old office for his new wing in the CIA.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:DamonDeNiroGedeckHuttonBerlinFeb07.jpg|thumb|right|Damon, De Niro, Gedeck and Hutton at the February 2007 premiere of the film in Berlin]]\n* [[Matt Damon]] as Edward Wilson Sr. He is the film's main character, partly based on [[James Jesus Angleton]] and partly on [[covert operations]] specialist [[Richard M.

Robinson]] and [[Jane Rosenthal]]. Academy Award Winning screenwriter, [[Eric Roth]], began work on the movie after abandoning his attempt to adapt [[Norman Mailer]]'s ''[[Harlot's Ghost]]'' for the big screen. Just like De Niro's project, Mailer's novel, ''Harlot's Ghost'', is a fictionalized chronicle of the CIA.\n\n[[Eric Roth]] originally wrote the screenplay in 1994 for [[Francis Ford Coppola]], and [[Columbia Pictures]].<ref name=\"Stewart\" /> After reading [[Norman Mailer]]'s ''[[Harlot's Ghost]]'', Roth became intrigued by the inner-workings of the people who created the CIA.<ref name=\"Hart\">{{cite news | last = Hart | first = Hugh | title = Soup o the CIA | work = [[San Francisco Chronicle]] | date = December 31, 2006 | url = http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2006/12/31/PKGL7N6CIV1.DTL&type=printable | access-date = 2009-09-16 }}</ref> Coppola ultimately departed from the project, citing his inability to relate to the main characters due to their lack of emotion, but is credited as Co-Executive Producer.<ref name=\"Stewart\"/> Following Coppola's departure, [[Wayne Wang]] was tapped to Direct, and was in the midst of Pre-Production location scouting when personnel changes in Columbia's production department ended his involvement. Columbia's new production team opted to give Roth a list of Directors to choose from; one of them being [[Philip Kaufman]]. Kaufman and Roth worked together on the project for a year overhauling the story's narrative structure that was originally linear (chronological order), adapting it to its final non-linear structure, going backward and forward in time. Kaufman, who believed this change would \"give it a more contemporary feeling,\" helped give this complex story a more cohesive narrative context, and provided subtext for characters' motivations.<ref name=\"Crowdus\">{{cite news | last = Crowdus | first = Gary | title = Living in a wilderness of mirrors: an interview with Eric Roth | work = [[Cineaste (magazine)|Cineaste]] | date = June 22, 2007 }}</ref> However, neither this partnership nor the project would survive another dramatic shake-up at the studio, when the new studio head halted production due to his lack of interest in making a spy film that fell outside the action genre.\n\nThe project languished until [[John Frankenheimer]] signed on to make the film with [[MGM]] agreeing to purchase the rights. He wanted Robert De Niro to star, having just worked together on ''[[Ronin (film)|Ronin]]''. De Niro had been developing his own spy story about the CIA from the Bay of Pigs Invasion to the fall of the [[Berlin Wall]] in 1989 and agreed to appear in the film.<ref name=\"Crowdus\"/> During pre-production in 2002, Frankenheimer died. According to producer [[Jane Rosenthal]], this had been Robert De Niro's pet project for nine years, but it proved difficult to produce in a pre-[[September 11, 2001|9/11]] world and had to compete with his busy schedule as an actor. The actor said in an interview, \"I had always been interested in the Cold War. I was raised in the Cold War. All of the intelligence stuff was interesting to me\".<ref name=\"Horn, John\">{{cite news | last = Horn | first = John | title = Intelligence Design | work = [[Los Angeles Times]] | date = November 5, 2006 | url = https://articles.latimes.com/2006/nov/05/entertainment/ca-shepherd5 | access-date = 2007-04-06 }}</ref> De Niro and Roth ended up making a deal: Roth would turn De Niro's idea into a screenplay if the actor would direct Roth's existing script. If ''The Good Shepherd'' proved to be a commercial success then their follow-up would be De Niro's pitch.<ref name=\"Stewart\"/>\n\nDe Niro took the project to [[Universal Pictures]] where Producer, [[Graham King]], agreed to help finance the $110 million budget. Initially they had a deal with [[Leonardo DiCaprio]], who was interested in playing the film's protagonist, Edward Wilson.<ref name=\"Horn, John\"/> De Niro planned to being production in early 2005, but DiCaprio had to back out due to his scheduling conflict filming ''[[The Departed]]'' for [[Martin Scorsese]].<ref name=\"Stewart\">{{cite news | last = Stewart | first = Ryan | title = Junket Report: ''The Good Shepherd'' | work = Cinematical | date = December 11, 2006 | url = http://www.cinematical.com/2006/12/11/junket-report-the-good-shepherd/ | access-date = 2009-09-16 }}</ref> At this point, King left the project, as did his backers. De Niro approached Matt Damon, who was also doing ''The Departed'' but would be done earlier than DiCaprio and De Niro would only have to wait six months to do the film with him.<ref name=\"Horn, John\"/> Initially, Damon had to turn down De Niro's offer because he was scheduled to shoot [[Steven Soderbergh]]'s ''[[The Informant!]]'', but was able to sign on to star as Edward Wilson after Soderbergh agreed to delay filming. James Robinson's Morgan Creek Productions agreed to help finance the film with a budget under $90 million, which meant that many of the principal actors, Damon included, would have to waive their usual salaries to keep costs down.<!-- page 2 --><ref name=\"Horn, John\"/>\n\nDe Niro was not interested in making a spy movie featuring excessive amounts of violence and exciting car chases. \"I just like it when things happen for a reason. So I want to downplay the violence, depict it in a muted way. In those days, it was a gentleman's game\".<ref name=\"Horn, John\"/> He and Roth were also interested in showing how absolute power corrupted the leaders of the CIA. Early on during production, De Niro said in an interview, \"they tried to do what they thought was right. And then, as they went on, they became overconfident and started doing things that are not always in our best interests\".<ref name=\"Horn, John\" /> In preparation for the film, De Niro watched spy films like ''[[The Spy Who Came in from the Cold (film)|The Spy Who Came In From the Cold]]'', ''[[The Third Man (film)|The Third Man]]'', and the ''[[Smiley's People (miniseries)|Smiley's People]]'' miniseries.<ref name=\"Thomson\">{{cite news | last = Thomson | first = David | title = Spies Like Us | work = [[The Guardian]] | date = June 22, 2007 | url = https://www.theguardian.com/film/2007/jun/22/robertdeniro | access-date = 2009-09-16 }}</ref>\n\nHe also hired retired CIA agent [[Milton Bearden]] to serve as a technical adviser on the film.

Three-time [[Academy Award]]-nominated [[art director]] [[Jeannine Oppewall]] was assigned art director for ''The Good Shepherd'', which would eventually earn Oppewall her fourth Oscar nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Art Direction|Best Art Design]].<ref name=\"ProdNotes\"/> She conducted a large amount of research for the film that filled ten to twelve {{convert|6|in|mm|adj=mid|-thick}} three-ring binders. It took her a week to organize the number of set locations due to the large amounts of settings in the script, which included Cuba, L\u00e9opoldville, London, [[Guatemala]], Moscow, New York City and [[New Haven, Connecticut]], among other places.\n\nAlthough the vast majority of the movie was filmed in New York, the only scenes that are actually set in New York were filmed at the Kirby Hill Estate on [[Long Island]]. As a result, many sets had to be constructed under Oppewall's direction, including a Skull and Bones headquarters and the Berlin set, which was built on the [[Brooklyn Navy Yard]].<ref name=\"ProdNotes\" /> The interiors of the CIA were built in the Brooklyn Armory, a large edifice built in 1901 for the United States Cavalry. She also visited the CIA's headquarters in Washington, D.C. and worked with Bearden to create sets for the CIA's offices, Technical Room and Communications Room.\n\nSince the lead character originally aspired to be a poet, Oppewall incorporated many visual poetic symbols into the film, including a large number of mirrors to represent the duplicity of the CIA, [[full-rigged ship]]s as symbols of the state, and [[eagle]] symbols, which were used in ironic situations such as suspect interrogations. Her team tracked down the right set dressings and also found authentic [[Teletype Corporation|Teletype]] machines, reel-to-reel tape recorders and radios used in the CIA during that time.<ref name=\"ProdNotes\" />\n\n===Music===\nThe music for the film was by  [[Bruce Fowler]] and [[Marcelo Zarvos]].

In May, 2007, the Center for the Study of Intelligence ([https://web.archive.org/web/20100706212154/https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/ Center for the Study of Intelligence]), a history group of the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]], held a round-table with a number of on-staff historians to discuss the film. The discussion was publicly released as an article; it covered the film's depiction of the OSS and CIA, the accuracy of the film's depiction of both the events and atmosphere of the period, and discussed factual details surrounding the actual persons on whom some of the film's characters were based. According to the article, the film was meticulous in getting small details (especially artifacts) correct, but the overall depiction of the atmosphere and motivations of the time was flawed. Nicholas Dujmovic said:<blockquote>A film can take a strictly documentary approach ... If that's the standard, then anyone with historical sense is going to dislike the liberties ''The Good Shepherd'' takes. If one approaches the film as a work of art, one must still ask if there is truth in the story-telling. Does it convey the sense of the time: the atmosphere, the motivations, the tone, and the challenges? I think we all agree that the film fails that test as well. It fails because it inserts themes we know from our studies of the period were not there: the overarching economic interest, the WASP mafia dominance, the cynicism, the dark perspective. In reality, the stakes were high during the Cold War; the Soviets were seen to be on the march and very dangerous. It was serious business, and there were many personal costs. And yet, most CIA people were enjoying their work at the same time, as any number of oral history interviews and memoirs will attest.<ref name=\"Robarge\" /></blockquote>\nThe same article also describes the depiction of Yale's infamous secret society, [[Skull and Bones]], as being an incubator of the [[United States Intelligence Community|U.S. Intelligence Community]] as \"inaccurate.\"\n\nThe film depicts the [[Bay of Pigs Invasion]] failure as the result of a leak within the CIA. [[James K. Galbraith]] wrote that the Taylor Report on the invasion confirmed the existence of a leak:<blockquote>One of the great travesties of the Cold War surfaced on April 29, 2000 when the Washington Post reported the declassification in full of General [[Maxwell D. Taylor|Maxwell Taylor]]'s June, 1961 special report on the Bay of Pigs invasion. Partial versions of this document have been available for decades. But only now did its darkest secret spill. Here is what Taylor reported to [[John F. Kennedy|Kennedy]]. The Russians knew the date of the invasion (Therefore, [[Fidel Castro|Castro]] also knew.) The CIA, headed by [[Allen Dulles]], knew that the Russians knew (Therefore, they knew the invasion would fail). The leak did not come from the invasion force; it had happened before the [[Cuban exile]]s were themselves briefed on the date. Kennedy was not informed. Nor, of course, were the exiles. And knowing all this, Dulles ordered the operation forward.<ref>{{harvnb|Galbraith|2000}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nOne of the panel of CIA historians who discussed the movie in a round table strongly disagreed that the leak was crucial, saying:<blockquote>Even if the operation had initially succeeded, the idea that this paramilitary battalion would have melted into the jungles and mountains to spawn a general uprising against Castro is fatuous. CIA's own analysts judged that Castro's popular support was strong and that he controlled the army and the security services. Even if the group had secured the beachhead, its members eventually would have been hunted down. The supposed leak had nothing to do with historical reality.<ref name=\"Robarge\" /></blockquote>\n\n===Accolades===\nIn 2007, the cast of ''The Good Shepherd'' won the Silver Bear of the [[Berlin International Film Festival]] for outstanding artistic contribution.
