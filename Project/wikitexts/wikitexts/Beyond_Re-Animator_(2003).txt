It is the third and final installment in the [[Re-Animator (film series)|''Re-Animator'' film series]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/280078/Beyond-Re-Animator/overview|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071017043724/http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/280078/Beyond-Re-Animator/overview|url-status=dead|archive-date=2007-10-17|department=Movies & TV Dept.|work=[[The New York Times]]|publisher=[[Baseline (database)|Baseline]] & [[All Movie Guide]]|author=Jason Buchanan|date=2007|title=Beyond Re-Animator}}</ref>\n\nAn international co-production of Spain and the United States, ''Beyond Re-Animator'' premiered on the [[Sci-Fi Channel]], though it was produced independently and acquired by the channel only as a distributor; this showing was cut to a TV-PG rating. The film received a limited theatrical run in the U.S. and was assigned an R rating, and a slightly longer unrated cut was released on home media in some countries.\n\n==Plot==\nFor the past 13 years, [[Dr. Herbert West]] has been serving a prison sentence due to a murder at the hands of one of his zombies.\n\nWith what scant supplies he has on hand in the prison medical center, Dr. West has been capable of performing only extremely basic experiments on rats. However, his lack of supplies does not prevent him from uncovering a key element in his re-animation process. Dr. West has discovered \"NPE\" (Nano-Plasmic Energy), an energy that can be extracted from the brain of a living organism through an electrocution-like process, to be stored in a capsule resembling a small light bulb. The capsule can then be connected to a corpse and used in conjunction with West's previously developed reagent to restore the former dead to a lifelike state. The NPE prevents the degeneration seen in previous instances, where the reanimated are nothing more than mindless zombies. Used together with the re-agent, reanimated corpses regain their skills, memories, and motor functions and nearly fully resemble normal humans.\n\nWhen a young doctor named Howard Phillips comes to work at the prison, West is assigned to assist the new doctor. Due to Phillips' interest in Dr. West's research, West is able to attain the supplies and tools needed to bring his experiments to the next level. It is revealed that Phillips is the younger brother of the teenage girl who was killed by West's zombie (he is shown watching West being taken away by the cops) and came to the prison for the explicit purpose of working with him. Despite his interest, Phillips still maintains an ethical reluctance to allow West's research to full completion. In the meantime, journalist Laura Olney, covering a story for her newspaper at the prison, meets and begins an affair with Dr. Phillips, and they fall in love. This new romance only temporarily postpones West's experiment, however. After the warden of the prison, also infatuated with Laura, attempts to seduce Laura himself, she resists and he angrily kills her.\n\nCrushed by Laura's death, Dr. Phillips succumbs to Dr. West's wishes and his experiments are allowed to literally take on new life. West & Phillips revive Laura with the NPE, although it is quickly seen that the dangerous side effects of West's past work are still present with the NPE. Eventually, the warden of the prison uncovers West's experiments and moves to put an end to them, but he is killed by West, and subsequently re-animated. West uses the NPE from a prisoner's pet rat, causing some unexpected side effects in the warden's behavior. It quickly manifests itself as the prison descends into utter chaos as a riot breaks out, with vials of the reagent circulating through the population. Soon, it is unclear who is dead, who is alive, and who has been exposed to the agent.\n\nWhen the chaos finally settles from the bloody prison riot, West escapes captivity before the guards appear by stealing Phillips' I.D. when he comes across Phillips weeping over Laura's decapitated body. As police and authorities take control of the prison, Phillips is dragged away as he and Laura's head start laughing. Herbert West is shown putting on his glasses outside the prison and disappears into the night to continue his research.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Jeffrey Combs]] as [[Dr. Herbert West]]\n* [[Jason Barry]] as Dr. Howard Phillips\n* [[Elsa Pataky]] as Laura Olney\n* [[Sim\u00f3n Andreu]] as Warden Brando\n* [[Santiago Segura]] as \"Speedball\"\n* Lolo Herrero as Sergeant Moncho\n* [[Enrique Arce]] as Cabrera\n* [[B\u00e1rbara Elorrieta]] as Emily Phillips\n* Raquel Gribler as Nurse Vanessa\n* Daniel Ortiz as Winni\n* Joaqu\u00edn Ortega as Officer Falcon\n\n==Reception==\nOn the review aggregator website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film holds an approval rating of 55% based on 11 critics, with an average rating of 5.30/10 <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/beyond_reanimator/|title=Beyond Reanimator|work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|access-date=May 6, 2022}}</ref>  [[AllRovi|Allmovie]] gave the film a mixed review, calling it \"almost a remake of the original\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.allmovie.com/movie/beyond-re-animator-v280078/review |title=Beyond Re-Animator (2003) |author=Jason Buchanan |work=[[AllRovi|Allmovie]] |access-date=1 July 2012}}</ref>  Jonathan Holland of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' writes that the film is \"sometimes shocking but rarely scary\" and \"calculated to appeal only to hardcore gore hounds.\"<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://variety.com/2003/film/reviews/beyond-re-animator-1200540105/|title=Review: 'Beyond Re-Animator'|last=Holland|first=Jonathan|journal=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=2003-08-04|access-date=2013-11-09}}</ref>  In a mixed review, Patrick Naugle of [[DVD Verdict]] called it \"somewhat of a letdown\" but \"worth at least one viewing\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dvdverdict.com/reviews/beyondreanimator.php|title=Beyond Re-Animator|last=Naugle|first=Patrick|work=[[DVD Verdict]]|date=2004-01-05|access-date=2013-11-09|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131109113731/http://www.dvdverdict.com/reviews/beyondreanimator.php|archive-date=2013-11-09}}</ref>  Writing for [[Bloody Disgusting]], Brad Miska rates the film 2.5/5 stars and called it \"a fun movie, but nothing special\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bloody-disgusting.com/film/108631/beyond-re-animator/?tab=bd-review|title=Beyond Re-Animator|last=Miska|first=Brad|work=[[Bloody Disgusting]]|date=2004-10-22|access-date=2013-11-09}}</ref>\n\nIn their book ''Lurker in the Lobby: A Guide to the Cinema of H.

Blumberg wrote that \"''Beyond Re-Animator'' is better than its immediate predecessor\" and that \"Combs slips back into the white shirt and black tie, wielding the hypo of green goo like he never put it down, but his performance is nicely tempered by the passage of time, giving us a West that lacks some of his youthful confidence but none of his single-minded desire to pursue 'The Work.'\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Blumberg|first=Arnold|title=Zombiemania: 80 Movies to Die For|publisher=[[Telos Publishing]]|year=2006|isbn=9781845830038|page=45 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Oia_BAAAQBAJ}}</ref> Bruce G. Hallenbeck, in his book ''Comedy-Horror Films: A Chronological History, 1914-2008'', again described Brian Yuzna's direction as \"competent but uninspired\", but said the film's biggest problem is that most of the cast are Spanish actors whose voices were obviously [[Dubbing|dubbed]] over to conceal their accents, resulting in a lack of both tension and comedy. He commented that Jeffrey Combs is still outstanding in the role of Herbert West, but his performance is muted due to a complete lack of strong co-stars to play off of.<ref>{{cite book |title=Comedy-Horror Films: A Chronological History, 1914-2008 |url=https://archive.org/details/comedyhorrorfilm00hall|url-access=limited |last=Hallenbeck |first=Bruce G.|publisher=[[McFarland & Company]]|year=2009 |isbn=9780786453788|pages=199\u2013201}}</ref>\n\n==Home media==\nIn 2011 [[Arrow Video]] released a Special Edition DVD of the film, with the following special features:\n* Audio commentary with director Brian Yuzna\n* 'All in the Head' Brian Yuzna on the Re-Animator Chronicles (50 mins)\n* Original trailer\n* Reversible cover sleeve with original and newly commissioned artwork by Tom Hodge 'The Dude Designs'\n* Double-sided fold-out poster featuring new artwork\n* Collector's booklet featuring 'World of Lovecraft' and an interview with star Jeffrey Combs by author and critic Calum Waddell, as well as an extract from H.
