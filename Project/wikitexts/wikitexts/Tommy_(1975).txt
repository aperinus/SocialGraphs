After his leave ends, Walker goes off to fight in [[World War II]] as a [[bomber pilot]], but is shot down during a mission. \"Captain Walker\" is listed as missing in action and is presumed dead, although\u2014unknown to his family\u2014the badly burnt Walker is still alive. Back in England, Nora goes into labour and gives birth to a son, Tommy, on [[V-E Day]] (\"Captain Walker/It's a Boy\"). Five years later, Nora has begun a new relationship with Frank, a holiday worker she and Tommy meet on their holiday. Tommy looks up to his \"Uncle\" Frank who expresses his desires to run his own [[holiday camp]] someday (\"Bernie's Holiday Camp\"). In the 1950s, Nora and Frank dream of their future (\"1951 / What About the Boy?\"), but, late that evening, the returning Captain Walker surprises the couple in bed, leading to a struggle where Frank kills the Captain (in the original album synopsis, the Captain kills Frank).<ref>{{Cite book|last=Atkins|first=John|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/43060511|title=The Who on record : a critical history, 1963-1998|date=2000|publisher=McFarland|isbn=0-7864-0609-7|location=Jefferson, N.C.|oclc=43060511}}</ref> The heat of the moment panics Tommy into a [[psychedelia]]-like \"Amazing Journey\", where he outwardly appears \"deaf, dumb, and blind\". Later, at a Christmas party, Nora is distressed that Tommy \"doesn't know what day it is\" (\"Christmas\").\n\nOver 16 years, Nora and Frank make several fruitless attempts to bring the now older Tommy out of his state (\"[[Eyesight to the Blind]]\" / \"[[The Acid Queen]]\") and place him with some questionable babysitters (\"Cousin Kevin\" / \"Fiddle About\"). They become increasingly lethargic at the lack of effect and leave Tommy standing at the mirror one night, allowing him to wander off. He follows a vision of himself to a junkyard [[pinball machine]]. Tommy is recognized by Frank and the media as a pinball prodigy (\"Extra, Extra, Extra\"), which is made even more impressive with his sensory-impaired state. During a championship game, Tommy faces the \"[[Pinball Wizard]]\" with The Who as the backing band. Nora watches her son's televised victory and celebrates his (and her) success and luxury, but finds she can't fully enjoy it because of Tommy's extreme condition (\"Champagne\").\n\nFrank finds a specialist for Tommy (\"There's a Doctor\") who concludes that Tommy's state is triggered emotionally rather than physically and explains the only hope is to continue having Tommy face his reflection (\"[[Go to the Mirror!]]\"). An increasingly frustrated Nora promptly throws Tommy through the mirror (\"Smash the Mirror!\") causing him to snap to full consciousness and run away momentarily (\"[[I'm Free (The Who song)|I'm Free]]\"). Tommy reveals that his experiences have transformed him and decides that he wants to transform the world (\"Mother and Son\" / \"Miracle Cure\").\n\nTommy goes on lecture tours that resemble glam-rock gospel shows and spreads a message of enlightenment by hang glider, gaining friends and followers everywhere he goes (\"Sally Simpson\" / \"Sensation\"). Tommy and a more enlightened and elated Nora and Frank welcome converts to their house, which quickly becomes too crowded to accommodate everyone. Tommy opens an extension for his religious campus (\"Welcome\" / \"Tommy's Holiday Camp\").\n\nThe converts, confused about Tommy's odd practices and his family's commercial exploitation of the compound, wrathfully demand Tommy teach them something useful. Tommy does so, deliberately deafening, muting, and blinding everyone, only to inadvertently invoke a riot. The followers kill Nora and Frank and destroy the camp in a fire (\"[[We're Not Gonna Take It (The Who song)|We're Not Gonna Take It]]\"). Tommy finds his parents in the debris and mourns before escaping into the mountains from the beginning of the film. He ascends the same peak where his parents celebrated their honeymoon, celebrating the rising sun (\"[[We're Not Gonna Take It (The Who song)|Listening to You]]\").<ref name=\"SM FM/LTY\" />\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Ann-Margret]] as Nora Walker, Tommy's mother who's obsessed with glamour and luxury but who also has a deep love for her son.\n* [[Oliver Reed]] as \"Uncle\" Frank Hobbs, Nora's brute boyfriend with a (subtle) soft side.\n* [[Roger Daltrey]] as Tommy Walker, a catatonic lad who develops messianic delusions.  \n** Barry Winch as young Tommy and Alison Dowling as young Tommy's singing voice.\n* [[Elton John]] as The Pinball Wizard, the cocky pinball champion of the world in four-and-a-half-foot high boots.\n* [[Tina Turner]] as The Acid Queen, an erratic prostitute who deals in prophetic LSD.\n* [[Eric Clapton]] as The Preacher, the leader of a Marilyn Monroe-themed cult.\n* [[Keith Moon]] as Uncle Ernie, Frank's clownish perverted pimp friend.\n* [[Paul Nicholas]] as Cousin Kevin, Tommy's sadomasochist relative with a biker punk aesthetic.\n* [[Jack Nicholson]] as The Specialist/Dr A.

They were not about a deaf dumb and blind boy's spiritual journey from darkness to light.\"<ref name=\"Russell p 118\">Russell p 118</ref>\n\nRussell did up his own treatment of the story as he saw it. He said \"This in no way deviated from his [Townshend's] original but plugged in the gaps where I found the story obscure or just non existent.\"<ref name=\"Russell p 118\"/> Russell said Townshend liked most of his suggestions and wrote new material.\n\nRussell and Townshend worked on the film together for a year.<ref name=\"blazes\">What the Blazes Is Ken Russell Up to Now?

In his [[Audio commentary|commentary]] for the 2004 DVD release of the film, [[Ken Russell]] stated that the opening and closing outdoor scenes were shot in the [[Borrowdale]] valley of the English [[Lake District]], near his own home, the same area that he had used to double for rural [[Austria]] and [[Bohemia]] in his earlier film ''[[Mahler (film)|Mahler]]'', in which Robert Powell had starred.\n\nMuch of the film was shot on locations around [[Portsmouth]], including the scene near the end of the film featuring the giant 'pinballs', which were, in fact, obsolete [[buoy]]s found in a British Navy yard, which were simply sprayed silver and filmed in situ. The Bernie's Holiday Camp ballroom sequence was shot inside the Gaiety Theatre on [[South Parade Pier]]. Exterior shots were filmed at [[Hilsea Lido]]<ref name=news20>{{cite news |title=Sparkling blue water of Hilsea Lido at its best|url=http://www.portsmouth.co.uk/community/remember-when/sparkling-blue-water-of-hilsea-lido-at-its-best-1-3352838 |newspaper=The News|date=20 December 2011 |access-date=14 August 2012}}</ref> (Russell had worked there before making ''The Boy Friend'').<ref>Russell p 123</ref> The Sally Simpson interior sequence was filmed in the Wesley Hall in Fratton Road, Portsmouth. The exterior intro sequence to the scene, however, shows Sally Simpson buying a badge and entering South Parade Pier.\n\nOn 11 June 1974, the pier caught fire and was badly damaged while the production was filming there.  According to Russell, the fire started during the filming of the scene of Ann-Margret and Oliver Reed dancing together during the \"Bernie's Holiday Camp\" sequence; smoke from the fire can be seen drifting in front of the camera in several shots. Russell also used a brief exterior shot of the building fully ablaze during the scenes of the destruction of Tommy's Holiday Camp by his disillusioned followers.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite video |title=Ken Russell commentary from  ''Tommy'' DVD|publisher=Umbrella Entertainment|year=2004}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.theheritagetrail.co.uk/piers/southsea%20south%20parade%20pier.htm |title=Southsea South Parade Pier |publisher=Theheritagetrail.co.uk |date=11 June 1974 |access-date=29 November 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20021228020507/http://www.theheritagetrail.co.uk/piers/southsea%20south%20parade%20pier.htm |archive-date=28 December 2002 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nThe [[Pinball Wizard]] sequence was shot at the [[Kings Theatre, Southsea|Kings Theatre in Southsea]] and the two pinball machines used were a 1965 Kings & Queens by Gottlieb\u2014used by Roger Daltrey\u2014and a Gottlieb Buckaroo also from 1965, used by Elton John.

All Saints in Commercial Road was used for the Sally Simpson wedding scene, whilst the meeting in the same sequence was filmed at the Wesley Hall in Fratton Road. The Eyesight to the Blind sequence was filmed at St Andrews Church in Henderson Road in Southsea. The other church featured was Warblington Church near Havant in Hampshire.\n\nThe famous scene in which Ann-Margret's character hallucinates that she is cavorting in detergent foam, baked beans, and chocolate reportedly took three days to shoot. According to Russell, the detergent and baked bean sequences were \"revenge\" parodies of real-life TV advertisements he had directed early in his career, although the baked bean sequence also references one of the cover photos and a parody radio ad from The&nbsp;Who's 1967 album ''[[The Who Sell Out]]''. Russell also recalled that Ann-Margret's husband, [[Roger Smith (actor)|Roger Smith]], strongly objected to the scene in which she slithers around in melted chocolate.\n\nDuring the filming, Ann-Margret accidentally struck her hand on the broken glass of the TV screen, causing a severe laceration, and Russell had to take her to hospital to have the wound stitched, although she was back on set the next day.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> The film also includes a scene in which Mrs. Walker watches a parodic TV advertisement for the fictional product \"Rex Baked Beans\"; the costumes in this segment were originally made for the lavish masked ball sequence in [[Richard Lester]]'s version of ''[[The Three Musketeers (1973 live-action film)|The Three Musketeers]],'' and the dress worn by the Queen in the Rex ad is that worn by [[Geraldine Chaplin]] in the earlier film.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0073812/trivia|title=IMDb \u2013 ''Tommy'' (1975) \u2013 Trivia|website=[[IMDb]] |access-date=23 December 2011}}</ref>\n\nRussell recalled that Townshend initially baulked at Russell's wish to have The&nbsp;Who performing behind Elton in the sequence (they did not perform the audio here), and also objected to wearing the pound-note suits, which were in fact stitched together from novelty pound-note tea-towels.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> On The Who's involvement with the film, members Daltrey played the title character; Moon played, in essence, a dual role as both Uncle Ernie and as himself along with Entwistle and Townshend miming on their respective instruments in the \"Eyesight to the Blind\" and \"Pinball Wizard\" segments. About his role as the Specialist, Jack Nicholson stated: \"In my whole career there was only one time when a director said to me, 'OK, come right down the pike and just look beautiful, Jack.'

Some of these were so-called matrix systems that combined the four original channels into two, which could be recorded on or transmitted by, existing two-channel stereo systems such as [[LP record]]s or [[FM radio]]. John Mosely used one of these systems ([[QS Regular Matrix]] from Sansui) to record front left, front right, back left, and back right channels on the left and right tracks of a four-track magnetic striped print of the [[Cinemascope]] type. A discrete centre channel was also recorded on the centre track of the print. The fourth (surround) track on the striped print was left unused. In addition, John Mosely used [[dbx (noise reduction)|dbx]] noise reduction on the magnetic tracks.\n\nUnlike the usual multiple small surround speakers used in cinemas, the Quintaphonic system specified just two rear speakers, but of the same type as those used at the front.\n\nOne problem that arose was that by the 1970s the four-track magnetic sound system was largely moribund. Only a few theatres were equipped with the necessary magnetic playback heads and other equipment; of those that did in many cases, it was not in working order. Thus, in addition to installing the extra electronics and rear speakers, John Mosely and his team had to repair and align the basic magnetic playback equipment. Each theatre that showed ''Tommy'' using the Quintaphonic system accordingly had to be specially prepared to take the film. In this respect there is a similarity between ''Tommy'' and [[Walt Disney]]'s ''[[Fantasia (1940 film)|Fantasia]]'', for which a special sound system ([[Fantasound]]) had been devised and required each theatre that showed it in the original release to be specially prepared. Also, like Fantasound, Quintaphonic Sound was never used again (five-channel stereo, in the form of [[5.1 surround sound]], eventually made a comeback).\n\n''Tommy'' was later released with mono, conventional four-track magnetic and [[Dolby]] Stereo soundtracks.\n\n==Changes from the album==\nUnlike other filmed rock operas (such as that of [[Pink Floyd]]'s ''[[Pink Floyd \u2013 The Wall|The Wall]]''), the album is never dubbed over the film.  All the songs were rerecorded featuring the film's cast \u2013 including Nicholson and Reed, neither of whom were known for their singing ability (Reed's character's songs were cut from ''[[Oliver! (film)|Oliver!]]'', and Nicholson's in ''[[On a Clear Day You Can See Forever (film)|On a Clear Day You Can See Forever]]'' appeared only in the now-lost roadshow version) \u2013 performing the songs in character.  Of The Who, Daltrey performs as Tommy and Townshend sings narration in place of [[recitative]].\n\nThe song order is shuffled around considerably; this and the addition of several new songs and links creates a more balanced structure of alternating short and long sequences. A large number of songs have new lyrics and instrumentation, and another notable feature is that many of the songs and pieces used on the film soundtrack are alternate versions or mixes from the versions on the [[Tommy (soundtrack)|soundtrack album]].\n\n===Differences between 1969 and 1975 versions===\n* The film opens with a new instrumental, \"Prologue\u20131945\" (partly based on the 1969 \"[[Overture (The Who song)|Overture]]\"), which accompanies the opening sequences of Captain Walker's romance and disappearance.\n* \"It's a Boy\" is separated from \"Overture\" and becomes the medley \"Captain Walker/It's A Boy\"; in the film this medley narrates the aftermath of Walker's disappearance, the end of the war and the birth of Tommy.\n* A new song, \"Bernie's Holiday Camp\", which follows \"Captain Walker/It's a Boy\", portrays Tommy's childhood and his mother's romance with Hobbs (Oliver Reed). The song also features the melody from, and even foreshadows, \"Tommy's Holiday Camp\".\n* The story's setting is updated so that the action goes through modern times (modern as of the 1970s). From this, the track \"1921\"  from the album is changed to \"1951\" and is made a medley, being titled \"What About the Boy?\" on the soundtrack, in which Capt. Walker dies instead of the lover (Frank, in this context).\n* \"The Amazing Journey\" (shortened to three minutes) has almost completely different lyrics, and the \"guide\" from the album is depicted as Tommy's dead father, rather than the \"tall stranger\" in a \"sparked, glittering gown\" from the album. A new introduction is also added in lieu of the \"Deaf, dumb, and blind boy; he's in a quiet vibration land...\" from the album. The movie version also ends with different fantastic lyrics, going \"His eyes are the eyes that transmit all he knows, The truth burns so bright it can melt winter snows. A towering shadow, so black and so high, A white sun burning the earth and the sky.\".\n* The running order of \"Christmas\" and \"Eyesight to the Blind\" is reversed; references to pinball are removed from \"Christmas\" and the character of The Hawker becomes The Preacher (Clapton), leader of the Marilyn Monroe cult. [[Arthur Brown (musician)|Arthur Brown]] is cast as the character The Priest in the film, and sings a verse in the song but is not featured on the soundtrack. According to Russell's DVD audio commentary, the concept of people literally worshipping celebrities (in this case Marilyn Monroe) and several other elements in the film were adapted from his pre-existing treatment for a film about false religions, which he had developed prior to ''Tommy'' but for which he had never been able to secure financial backing.\n* The running order of \"The Acid Queen\" and \"Cousin Kevin\" is reversed.\n* \"Underture\" is removed but parts from it have been re-arranged as \"Sparks\".\n* \"The Acid Queen\", \"Cousin Kevin\", \"Fiddle About\", and \"Sparks\", linked by three renditions of \"Do You Think It's Alright?\" form an extended sequence depicting Tommy's inner journey and his trials.\n* A three-minute version of the \"Sparks\" theme (with, then new, synthesizer orchestration) precedes \"Extra, Extra, Extra\" and \"Pinball Wizard\". In the film, it is used behind the sequence of the dazed Tommy wandering into a junkyard and discovering a pinball machine. The music on the film soundtrack (for this and many other songs) is heavily edited, however, and is a noticeably different mix from the version on the soundtrack album.\n* A new linking theme, \"Extra, Extra, Extra\", narrates Tommy's rise to fame and introduces the battle with the pinball champ. It is set to the tune of \"Miracle Cure\" and precedes \"Pinball Wizard\".\n* \"Pinball Wizard\" has extra lyrics and movements. It features guitar and keyboard solos (the guitars are only readily discernible on the soundtrack album), and an outro with a riff reminiscent of the Who's first single, \"[[I Can't Explain]]\".\n* A new song, \"Champagne\", which follows \"Pinball Wizard\", covers the sequence of Tommy's stardom and wealth and his parents' greed. Like many other songs, it features Tommy singing \"See Me, Feel Me\" interludes: this is the first song with ''Daltrey'' singing for Tommy. In the film (but not on the soundtrack), the song is introduced by a mock TV commercial\u2014reminiscent of the Who's early years when they made [[jingle]]s.\n* \"Go to the Mirror\" is shortened, not featuring the elements of \"Listening To You\", nor the phrase \"Go to the mirror, boy.\"\n* \"I'm Free\" is moved earlier, and now follows \"Smash The Mirror!\" (as was done on the 1972 symphonic album); it covers the lavish [[Psychedelia|psychedelic]] sequence depicting Tommy's reawakening.\n* \"I'm Free\" is followed by a new song, \"Mother and Son\", which depicts Tommy's rejection of [[materialism]] and his vision for a new faith based around pinball.\n* \"Sensation\", featuring extra lyrics, is moved forward and covers the spread of Tommy's new religion. In the film it occurs between \"Sally Simpson\" and \"Welcome\". (On the soundtrack album, it occurs between \"Mother and Son\" and \"Miracle Cure\"\u2014with the extra [narration] lyrics and guitar solo included on the [[Compact Cassette|cassette]] and CD versions, but not the [[LP record|LP]] version.)\n* \"Sally Simpson\" is re-arranged with a [[Bo Diddley]] beat and in the film is preceded by \"Miracle Cure\"\u2014which features an extra verse.\n* In \"Sally Simpson\", the album version mentions her father's [[Rolls-Royce (car)|Rolls-Royce]] as blue, but the film changes the lyrics to black (the Rolls-Royce in the film is also black).\n* In \"Sally Simpson\", the album version describes Tommy giving a lesson. In the film, Tommy gives a lesson, and the lyrics are changed to the words of the lesson.\n* In the album version of \"Sally Simpson\", the title character jumps on the stage and brushes Tommy's cheek, but in the movie she is kicked off the stage before she can get close to Tommy.\n* A new linking piece, \"T.V. Studio\", is used between \"Welcome\" and \"Tommy's Holiday Camp\".\n* The 1969 album's closing track \"We're Not Gonna Take It\" is split into two pieces, \"We're Not Gonna Take It\" and medley \"See Me Feel Me/Listening To You\";<ref name=\"SM FM/LTY\">\"See Me, Feel Me/Listening To You\" is the name given in the song book for the soundtrack album; the soundtrack album itself calls it \"Listening To You/See Me, Feel Me\".</ref> this covers the climactic film sequences of Tommy's fall from grace and his final redemption and opens with an extra chorus sung by the crowd (\"These pricey deals don't teach us...\").\n* The CD reissue of the soundtrack album opens with a version \"Overture From Tommy\" previously released on a vinyl single in 1975, but not included either in the film or on the original soundtrack LP. Although the track is listed in the CD's song credits as being performed by The Who, it is actually a Pete Townshend solo number with him playing all the instruments (as with \"Prologue \u2013 1945\" and other tracks)\u2014neither John Entwistle or Keith Moon appear on it, as they do on all other selections on the soundtrack credited to \"The Who,\" regardless of whether Roger Daltrey performs as vocalist.\n\n==Soundtrack==\n\n{{Main|Tommy (soundtrack)}}\n\n===Sales chart performance===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Year\n!Chart\n!Position\n|-\n|1975\n|Australia ([[Kent Music Report]])<ref name=aus>{{cite book|last=Kent|first=David|author-link=David Kent (historian)|title=Australian Chart Book 1970\u20131992|edition=illustrated|publisher=Australian Chart Book|location=St Ives, N.S.W.|year=1993|isbn=0-646-11917-6|page=282}}</ref>\n|style=\"text-align: center;\"|6\n|-\n|1975\n|''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' Pop Albums\n|style=\"text-align: center;\"|2\n|-\n|1975\n|UK Chart Albums\n|style=\"text-align: center;\"|21\n|}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Notes==\n* {{cite book|title=Altered states|url=https://archive.org/details/alteredstatesaut00russ|url-access=registration|first=Ken |last=Russell|year=1991|publisher=Bantam Books|isbn=9780553078312 }}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|0073812|Tommy}}\n* {{tcmdb title|id=28193}}\n* {{amg movie|50339}}\n* {{AFI film|55692}}\n* {{mojo title|tommy|Tommy}}\n* {{rotten-tomatoes|1021648-tommy|Tommy}}\n* {{YouTube|lF-kVn4ICUs|Keith Moon capture the Rock Music Award for Best Rock Movie of the Year 1975}}\n\n{{Tommy}}\n{{The Who}}\n{{Ken Russell}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Tommy (1975 Film)}}\n[[Category:Tommy (rock opera)]]\n[[Category:1975 films]]\n[[Category:1970s musical fantasy films]]\n[[Category:British musical fantasy films]]\n[[Category:Films about blind people]]\n[[Category:Films based on albums]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Ken Russell]]\n[[Category:Films featuring a Best Musical or Comedy Actress Golden Globe winning performance]]\n[[Category:Films set in the 1940s]]\n[[Category:Films set in the 1950s]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Cumbria]]\n[[Category:Pete Townshend]]\n[[Category:British rock music films]]\n[[Category:Rock operas]]\n[[Category:Sung-through musical films]]\n[[Category:The Who soundtracks]]\n[[Category:Columbia Pictures films]]\n[[Category:Films produced by Robert Stigwood]]\n[[Category:Films about deaf people]]\n[[Category:Films about disability]]\n[[Category:Films about dysfunctional families]]\n[[Category:British World War II films]]\n[[Category:Films shot in England]]\n[[Category:Films set in England]]\n[[Category:1975 independent films]]\n[[Category:British independent films]]\n[[Category:Cultural depictions of Elton John]]\n[[Category:1970s English-language films]]\n[[Category:1970s British films]]"}]}}}}
