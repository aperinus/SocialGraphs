She hitches a ride with Frank Lloyd ([[James Belushi]]), who is traveling with his abused wife, Rayanne Lloyd ([[Shannon Whirry]]), on his way to sell stolen computer chips. They are briefly stopped by a state trooper ([[Sherman Howard]]) who gives Frank a ticket for speeding, and are passed on the road by a tow truck driver ([[Jesse Borrego]]). They make a stop at a gas station belonging to Frank's friend, Sam ([[M. Emmet Walsh]]), who gives Frank evidence of Rayanne's cheating on him with the tow truck driver, Jesse. Tensions rise; Frank shoots Rayanne and attempts the same with Karen, but Karen escapes into the desert where she stumbles upon a laboratory where Brian, a scientist, is testing a [[time machine]] on mice. The machine goes off by accident, sending Karen back to where she was twenty minutes earlier.\n\nKaren awakes in Frank's car, just after she was picked up. This time when the trooper stops their car, Karen asks the state trooper for help, which causes the situation to worsen \u2014 Frank kills Rayanne, the state trooper and Jesse. Karen escapes to the laboratory, where she explains to Brian what she knows. They agree to go back in time together, so Brian can call the police on Frank.\n\nKaren awakes in Frank's car and takes his gun, causing a struggle. Rayanne reveals a gun of her own, but misses when she tries to shoot Frank. Despite Karen's preemptive knowledge, Frank kills Rayanne, Jesse, the state trooper and the vacationing parents of a boy named Paul (Robbie Thibaut Jr.). Brian, who was unable to convince the police to come, arrives on the scene and explains to Frank about the time machine. Frank, using Paul as hostage, forces Brian to send them back in time.\n\nFrank and Paul awake ten minutes earlier, in the middle of the fight. Paul helps Karen, but he and his parents are killed. When Brian arrives, Karen tells him that they have to go back again. They return to the laboratory, chased by Frank, but succeed in overloading the whole system to go back 60 minutes.\n\nKaren awakes in her car, before Frank has picked her up. When Frank and Rayanne drive by, Karen politely refuses a lift. The state trooper comes by next, and Karen warns him about Frank. Brian then arrives to pick Karen up, and they arrive at the gas station after it's all over: Frank has killed Sam and Jesse, and has been shot dead by Rayanne, who is arrested by the state trooper.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[James Belushi]] as Frank Lloyd\n* [[Kylie Travis]] as Karen Warren\n* [[Shannon Whirry]] as Rayanne Lloyd\n* [[Frank Whaley]] as Brian\n* [[Jesse Borrego]] as Jesse\n* [[M.

Like the most memorable of these, it's lifted out of the rut by a quirky, imaginative script. True, Belushi's performance is overbearing and M. Emmet Walsh turns in yet another sweaty cameo; true, too, that the frequent visual emphasis on Travis' cleavage flags the movie's compromised ambitions. Nevertheless, there's more than enough energy, bravado and invention to engage the attention throughout.\"<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.timeout.com/london/film/retroactive|title=Retroactive|newspaper=Time Out London|access-date=2016-11-05}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of films featuring time loops]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{IMDb title|0117468|Retroactive}}\n*{{Rotten Tomatoes|id=retroactive|title=Retroactive}}\n\n[[Category:1997 films]]\n[[Category:American adventure films]]\n[[Category:American science fiction action films]]\n[[Category:Orion Pictures films]]\n[[Category:1990s action films]]\n[[Category:1990s adventure films]]\n[[Category:1990s science fiction films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Louis Morneau]]\n[[Category:Time loop films]]\n[[Category:1990s English-language films]]\n[[Category:1990s American films]]"}]}}}}
