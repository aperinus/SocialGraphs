It tells the story of abrasive, selfish young [[wikt:wheeler-dealer|wheeler-dealer]] Charlie Babbitt ([[Tom Cruise]]), who discovers that his estranged father has died and bequeathed virtually all of his multimillion-dollar estate to his other son, Raymond ([[Dustin Hoffman]]), an [[Autism spectrum|autistic]] [[Savant syndrome|savant]], of whose existence Charlie was unaware. Charlie is left with only his father's beloved vintage car and rosebushes. [[Valeria Golino]] also stars as Charlie's girlfriend Susanna.

In addition, per WP:FILMPLOT, the plot summary should be kept between 400-700 words. -->\nCollectibles dealer Charlie Babbitt is in the middle of importing four [[Grey import vehicle|grey market]] [[Lamborghini]]s to [[Los Angeles]] for resale. He needs to deliver the cars to impatient buyers, who have already made down payments, in order to repay the loan he took out to buy them, but the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|EPA]] is holding the cars at the port because they have failed [[Vehicle emission standard|emissions tests]]. Charlie directs an employee to lie to the buyers while he stalls his creditor.\n\nWhen Charlie learns that his estranged father Sanford Babbitt has died, he and his girlfriend Susanna travel to [[Cincinnati]] in order to settle the estate. He inherits only a group of rosebushes and a classic 1949 [[Buick Roadmaster#1949\u20131953|Buick Roadmaster]] convertible over which he and his father clashed, while the remainder of the $3{{nbsp}}million estate is going to an unnamed [[trustee]]. He learns that the money is being directed to a local [[Psychiatric hospital|mental institution]], where he meets his elder brother, Raymond, of whom he was unaware his whole life.\n\nRaymond has [[autism]] and [[savant syndrome]] and adheres to strict routines. He has [[Eidetic memory|superb recall]], but he shows little emotional expression except when in distress. Charlie spirits Raymond out of the mental institution and into a hotel for the night. Susanna becomes upset with the way Charlie treats his brother and leaves him. Charlie asks Raymond's doctor, Dr. Gerald Bruner, for half the estate in exchange for Raymond's return, but Bruner refuses. Charlie decides to attempt to gain custody of his brother in order to get control of the money.\n\nAfter Raymond [[Fear of flying|refuses to fly]] to Los Angeles, he and Charlie resort to driving there instead. They make slow progress because Raymond insists on sticking to his routines, which include watching ''[[The People's Court]]'' on television every day, getting to bed by 11:00 PM, and refusing to travel when it rains. He also objects to traveling on the [[Interstate Highway System|interstate]] after they encounter a car accident. During the course of the journey, Charlie learns more about Raymond, including his ability to instantly [[mental calculator|perform complex calculations]] and [[Subitizing|count hundreds of objects at once]], far beyond the normal range of human abilities. He also realizes Raymond had lived with the family as a child and was the \"Rain Man\", a comforting figure that Charlie had falsely remembered as an imaginary friend. Raymond had saved an infant Charlie from being scalded by hot bathwater one day, but their father had blamed him for nearly injuring Charlie and committed him to the institution, as he was unable to speak up for himself and correct the misunderstanding.\n\nCharlie's creditor [[repossession|repossesses]] the Lamborghinis, forcing him to refund his buyers' down payments and leaving him deeply in debt. Having passed [[Las Vegas]], he and Raymond return to [[Caesars Palace]] on the [[Las Vegas Strip|Strip]] and devise a plan to win the needed money by playing [[blackjack]] and [[card counting|counting cards]]. Though the casino bosses obtain videotape evidence of the scheme and ask them to leave, Charlie successfully wins $86,000 to cover his debts and reconciles with Susanna, who has rejoined the brothers in Las Vegas.\n\nReturning to Los Angeles, Charlie meets with Bruner, who offers him $250,000 to walk away from Raymond. Charlie refuses and says that he is no longer upset about being cut out of his father's will, but he wants to have a relationship with his brother. At a meeting with a court-appointed psychiatrist, Raymond proves unable to decide for himself what he wants. Charlie stops the questioning and tells Raymond he is happy to have him as his brother. As Raymond and Bruner board a train to return to the institution, Charlie promises to visit in two weeks.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Dustin Hoffman]] as Raymond \"Ray\" Babbitt\n* [[Tom Cruise]] as Charles \"Charlie\" Babbitt\n* [[Valeria Golino]] as Susanna\n* [[Gerald R.

Prior to the conception of Rain Man, Morrow had formed a friendship with the intellectually disabled Sackter, and in doing so ended up taking some situational aspects from his friendship and using them to help craft the relationship between Charlie and Raymond. Following the success of the made-for-TV movie he had written about Sackter, ''[[Bill (1981 film)|Bill]]'', Morrow met the notorious Kim Peek and was wildly intrigued by his Savant Syndrome. Initially going into the creation of the film, Morrow was essentially unaware of the intricacies of the condition, as well as of autism itself, deciding instead the movie was less about Raymond's intellectual disability and more about the relationship formed between Raymond and Charlie.<ref name=\":24\">{{Cite web |date=2018-12-13 |title=Rain Man at 30: damaging stereotype or 'the best thing that happened to autism'? |url=http://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/dec/13/rain-man-at-30-autism-hoffman-cruise-levinson |access-date=2022-05-09 |website=the Guardian |language=en}}</ref>\n\n[[Roger Birnbaum]] was the first studio executive to give the film a [[green-light|green light]]; he did so immediately after Barry Morrow pitched the story.

Hoffman had some experience with disabled individuals prior to filming, having worked at the New York Psychiatric Institute when he was younger. Inspiration for the portrayal of Raymond Babbitt's mannerisms was drawn from a multitude of sources, including Kim Peek and the autistic brother of a Princeton football player with whom Hoffman was in touch with at the time. Part of Hoffman's research into the role also included in-person meetings with savant Kim Peek, wherein he would observe and mimic Peek's actions in order to attempt to give an accurate portrayal at what an individual with Savant Syndrome might act like. His mimicry of Peek's Savant Syndrome was deemed a poor fit for the character by Hoffman, resulting in Hoffman deciding to make Babbitt not only a man with Savant Syndrome, but also a man with autism.<ref name=\":24\"/> This decision was one that proved to only further the misunderstanding of autism spectrum disorder among the general public: though autism is, in itself, a varying condition with numerous ways in which it is characterized, having both autism and Savant Syndrome is an incredibly rare occurrence.<ref name=\"Prochnow 2014 133\u2013149\">{{Cite journal |last=Prochnow |first=Alexandria |date=2014 |title=AN ANALYSIS OF AUTISM THROUGH MEDIA REPRESENTATION |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/24761922 |journal=ETC: A Review of General Semantics |volume=71 |issue=2 |pages=133\u2013149 |issn=0014-164X}}</ref> Even so, audiences were swayed into thinking that most autistic individuals were intellectually capable of savant abilities largely by the Hoffman's portrayal of Raymond Babbitt.\n\n[[Principal photography]] included nine weeks of [[filming location|filming on location]] in [[Cincinnati]] and throughout northern [[Kentucky]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.wcpo.com/entertainment/local-a-e/rain-man-then-and-now-a-look-back-at-rain-man-in-cincinnati-and-northern-kentucky |title= Then and Now: A look back at 'Rain Man' in Cincinnati and Northern Kentucky |author1=Alter, Maxim |author2=Maxwell, Emily |work=WCPO |date=February 28, 2014 |access-date=January 10, 2022}}</ref> Other portions were shot in the desert near [[Palm Springs, California]].<ref name=Niemann>{{Cite book\n | last = Niemann\n | first = Greg\n | title = Palm Springs Legends: creation of a desert oasis\n | publisher = [[Sunbelt Publications]]\n | year = 2006\n | location = San Diego, CA\n | pages = 286\n | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=RwXQGTuL1M0C&q=palm+springs+film+locations&pg=PA169\n | isbn = 978-0-932653-74-1\n | oclc = 61211290\n }}<!-- {{LCC|F869 P18 N45 2006}} {{ASIN|093265374X}}--> ([http://catdir.loc.gov/catdir/toc/ecip0516/2005021837.html here for Table of Contents] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304111950/http://catdir.loc.gov/catdir/toc/ecip0516/2005021837.html |date=March 4, 2016 }})</ref>{{rp|168\u201371}}\n\nThere was originally a different ending to the movie drafted by Morrow which differed from Raymond going back to the institution.

#63\n\n== Legacy ==\nAfter its release in 1988, ''Rain Man'' saw funding for medical research and diagnoses of individuals for autism spectrum disorder increase tenfold. Rain Man is a movie famous in particular for its portrayal of a man with both autism and Savant Syndrome, leading much of its viewing audience to understand the intellectual capabilities of those with autism in an incorrect way.<ref name=\":24\"/>\n\nThe character of Raymond Babbitt has been criticized for fitting into the [[stereotype]] of the \"Magical/Savant\" autistic character. Characters like these are portrayed as having an otherworldly intellectual ability that, rather than disable them from living a \"normal\" life, instead assists them in a nearly magical way, causing those around them to be in awe and wonder as to how a person might have this capability. While having Savant Syndrome is certainly a possibility for autistic individuals, it is incredibly rare.<ref name=\"Prochnow 2014 133\u2013149\"/>\n\n== In popular culture ==<!-- Two or three prominent examples are enough to illustrate the film's role in popular culture. Popular culture sections are *not* exhaustive lists of every single reference to the subject of the article. -->\n''Rain Man''{{'}}s portrayal of the main character's condition has been seen as creating the erroneous media stereotype that people on the [[autism spectrum]] typically have savant skills, and references to ''Rain Man'', in particular Dustin Hoffman's performance, have become a popular shorthand for autism and savantism. Conversely, ''Rain Man'' has also been seen as ''dispelling'' a number of other misconceptions about autism, and improving public awareness of the failure of many agencies to accommodate autistic people and make use of the abilities they do have, regardless of whether they have savant skills or not.<ref>{{cite web |title= Rain Man, the Movie/Rain Man, Real Life |url= https://www.wisconsinmedicalsociety.org/professional/savant-syndrome/resources/articles/rain-man-the-movie-rain-man-real-life/ |first= Darold |last= Treffert |access-date= September 29, 2014 |archive-date= August 27, 2015 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20150827173420/https://www.wisconsinmedicalsociety.org/professional/savant-syndrome/resources/articles/rain-man-the-movie-rain-man-real-life/ |url-status= dead }}</ref>\n\nThe film is also known for popularizing the misconception that [[card counting]] is illegal in the United States.<ref name=\"bjlaw\">{{cite book |title=Blackjack and the Law |last1=Rose |first1=I. Nelson |last2=Loeb |first2=Robert A. |isbn=978-0-910575-08-9 |year=1999 |publisher=Rge Pub}}</ref>\n\nThe Babbitt brothers appear in ''[[The Simpsons]]'' season 5 episode [[$pringfield (or, How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love Legalized Gambling)|''$pringfield'']]. The film is mentioned in numerous other films such as ''[[Miss Congeniality (film)|Miss Congeniality]]'' (2000), ''[[21 (2008 film)|21]]'' (2008), ''[[Tropic Thunder]]'' (2008) (in which Tom Cruise made an appearance), ''[[The Hangover]]'' (2009), ''[[Escape Room (2019 film)|Escape Room]]'' (2019), and also in the television series ''[[Breaking Bad]]''.\n\nRaymond Babbitt was caricatured as a rain cloud in the animated episode of ''[[The Nanny]]'', \"[[The Nanny (season 3)|Oy to the World]]\". During the episode, Fran fixes up CC the Abominable Babcock with the Rain Man. He is portrayed as a cloud of rain mumbling about weather patterns and being an excellent driver.\n\n===Qantas and airline controversy===\nDuring June 1989, at least fifteen major airlines showed edited versions of ''Rain Man'' that omitted a scene involving Raymond's [[fear of flying|refusal to fly]], mentioning the crashes of [[American Airlines Flight 625]], [[Delta Air Lines Flight 191]], and [[Continental Airlines Flight 1713]], except on Australia-based [[Qantas]]. Those criticizing this decision included film director Barry Levinson, co-screenwriter Ronald Bass, and [[George Kirgo]] (at the time the President of the [[Writers Guild of America, West]]). \"I think it's a key scene to the entire movie,\" Levinson said in a telephone interview. \"That's why it's in there. It launches their entire odyssey across country \u2013 because they couldn't fly.\" While some of those airlines cited as justification avoiding having airplane passengers feel uncomfortable in sympathy with Raymond during the in-flight entertainment, the scene was shown intact on flights of Qantas, and commentators noted that Raymond mentions ''it'' as the only airline whose planes have \"never crashed\".<ref name=ny>{{cite news|title=Airlines Cut Scene From 'Rain Man'|date=June 29, 1989|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/06/29/movies/airlines-cut-scene-from-rain-man.html|access-date=June 6, 2015|archive-date=June 13, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150613035239/http://www.nytimes.com/1989/06/29/movies/airlines-cut-scene-from-rain-man.html|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=la>{{cite news|last=Weinstein|first=Steve|title=Uneasy Airlines Get Final Cut on 'Rain Man'|date=June 29, 1989|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|url=https://articles.latimes.com/1989-06-29/entertainment/ca-3726_1_airlines-plane-rain-man|access-date=June 6, 2015|archive-date=June 16, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150616024746/http://articles.latimes.com/1989-06-29/entertainment/ca-3726_1_airlines-plane-rain-man|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe film is credited with introducing Qantas' safety record to U.S. consumers.<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Kamenev|first=Marina|title=Qantas: Airline Safety's Golden Child No More?|date=November 24, 2010|magazine=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|url=http://content.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,2032492,00.html|access-date=June 6, 2015|archive-date=May 24, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150524233906/http://content.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,2032492,00.html|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Is Qantas still the world's safest airline?|date=January 7, 2014|publisher=[[News.com.au]]|url=http://www.news.com.au/travel/travel-updates/is-qantas-still-the-worlds-safest-airline/story-e6frfq80-1226796848267|access-date=June 6, 2015|archive-date=January 7, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140107130955/http://www.news.com.au/travel/travel-updates/is-qantas-still-the-worlds-safest-airline/story-e6frfq80-1226796848267|url-status=live}}</ref> However, contrary to the claims made in the film, Qantas aircraft have been involved in a number of [[List of Qantas fatal accidents|fatal accidents]] since the airline's founding in 1920, though none involving jet aircraft, with the last incident taking place in December 1951.<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Palmer|first=Brian|title=Is Qantas The World's Safest Airline?|date=1 November 2011|magazine=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/explainer/2011/11/airline_safety_does_qantas_airlines_crash_free_record_make_it_th.html|access-date=5 May 2022|archive-date=24 May 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150524232929/http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/explainer/2011/11/airline_safety_does_qantas_airlines_crash_free_record_make_it_th.html|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===The Buick convertible===\nTwo 1949 Roadmaster convertibles were used in the filming, one of which had its rear suspension stiffened to bear the additional load of camera equipment and a cameraman.
