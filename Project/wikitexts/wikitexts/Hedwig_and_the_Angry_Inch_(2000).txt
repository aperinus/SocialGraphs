The film follows Hedwig and her backing band, the Angry Inch, as they shadow Tommy's tour, while exploring Hedwig's past and her forced [[gender identity]]. Mitchell reprises his role as Hedwig from the original production.\n\nDespite largely positive reviews from critics and audiences, the film's limited release only grossed $3.6 million from an estimated $6 million budget. The musical has since developed a devoted [[cult following]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/hedwig-and-the-angry-inch,35004/ |title=''The A.V.

Mitchell received a [[Golden Globe]] nomination for [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor \u2013 Motion Picture Musical or Comedy|Best Actor \u2013 Motion Picture Musical or Comedy]] and the ''[[Premiere (magazine)|Premiere]]'' magazine Performance of the Year Award.\n\n==Plot==\nHansel Schmidt is a gay, [[East Germany|East German]] teenager who loves rock music and is stuck in East Berlin until he meets [[Sergeant]] Luther Robinson, an American soldier. Luther proposes marriage to Hansel, persuading him to change his sex in order to leave [[Communist]] East Germany for [[West Germany|the West]] as his wife, as that was the only legal solution. Hansel's mother, Hedwig, gives her child her name and passport and finds a doctor to perform a genital surgery. The operation is botched, however, leaving Hansel \u2013 now Hedwig \u2013 with a dysfunctional one-inch mound of flesh between her legs, the titular \"Angry Inch\".\n\nHedwig goes to live in [[Junction City, Kansas]] as Luther's wife. On their first wedding anniversary, Luther leaves Hedwig for a man. That same day, it is announced that the [[Berlin Wall]] has fallen and East Germans are flooding freely into the West, meaning as material gains go, Hedwig's sacrifices have been for nothing. Hedwig recovers from the separation by confidently accepting her identity as a woman, picking up some \"odd jobs,\" and returning to her \"first love\" of music by forming a rock band composed of Korean-born Army wives. Babysitting for \"the commander of the nearby fort,\" she befriends Tommy Speck, a shy and misunderstood teenager questioning his Christian upbringing. For six months, she teaches him \"rock history, lyrics, grooming, and vocal training\" taking him from playing the occasional guitar masses to the two of them \"out-grossing monster trucks in Wichita.\" Hedwig gives him the stage name \"Tommy Gnosis\" (stating that ''[[Gnosis]]'' is the Greek word for \"knowledge\") for his graduation. Upon discovering her \"inch,\" Tommy leaves Hedwig and goes on to become a wildly successful rock star by stealing Hedwig's songs.\n\nHedwig and her band, the Angry Inch (now composed of Eastern Europeans including her husband, Yitzhak), are forced to support themselves by playing in a chain of failing seafood restaurants called Bilgewater's and other small venues. Hedwig is following Tommy's tour while pursuing a copyright lawsuit. In between songs, she reflects on her life's story through flashbacks and stories told directly to either uninterested restaurant patrons or her small, but loyal group of fans.\n\nThroughout the film, Hedwig refers to [[Aristophanes]]' speech in [[Plato]]'s ''[[Symposium (Plato)|Symposium]]''. This myth, retold by Hedwig in the song \"[[The Origin of Love (song)|The Origin of Love]]\", explains that human beings were once round, two-faced, four-armed, and four-legged beings. Angry gods split these early humans in two, leaving the separated people with a lifelong yearning for their other half.\n\nNear the end of the film, Hedwig is down and out, her band and manager having abandoned her in disgust after she tears up Yitzhak's passport. While working as a streetwalker, she finally reunites with Tommy and they reconcile. After the two of them accidentally drive Tommy's limo into a news truck, paparazzi burst onto the scene, Hedwig becomes famous and Gnosis' popularity tanks. Reunited with her band, Hedwig performs at [[Times Square]], culminating in a violent removal of her drag.\n\nEntering the final chapter of the film, it seems to take place in a non-real space, perhaps Hedwig's mind. Now in male form, Hedwig discovers herself alone in front of Tommy on a huge stage. Tommy sings to Hedwig, pleading forgiveness and saying goodbye; she realizes that she created her \"other half\" from within herself. Hedwig then finds herself back at Times Square, but the space seems transformed, with ambient white lighting. The band members, dressed all in white, are already in their places on stage. Hedwig gives Yitzhak her blonde wig, allowing Yitzhak to take her place, and sings in solidarity with \"all the misfits and losers\" of the world. A brief animated sequence symbolizing the union of the separated Platonic halves leads to the final shot: Hedwig walking naked down a dark alley and into the street.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[John Cameron Mitchell]] as Hedwig Robinson/Hansel Schmidt\n** Ben Mayer-Goodman as young Hansel\n* [[Miriam Shor]] as Yitzhak\n* [[Stephen Trask]] as Skszp\n* [[Andrea Martin]] as Phyllis Stein, Hedwig's manager\n* [[Michael Pitt]] as Tommy Speck/Tommy Gnosis\n* Theodore Liscinski as Jacek\n* [[Rob Campbell]] as Krzysztof\n* [[Michael Aronov]] as Schlatko\n* [[Alberta Watson]] as Hedwig Schmidt, Hansel's mother\n* Maurits Niggebrugge as Hansel's father\n* [[Sook-Yin Lee]] as Kwahng-Yi\n* [[Maurice Dean Wint]] as Sergeant Luther Robinson\n* [[Rosie O'Donnell]] as herself\n* [[Dar Williams]] as singer on main stage\n* [[Karen Hines]] as Tommy's publicist\n\n==Soundtrack==\n{{further|Hedwig and the Angry Inch (soundtrack)}}\n# \"Tear Me Down\"\n# \"Random Number Generation\" (excerpt only)\n# \"Tear Me Down\" (Tommy Gnosis version) (excerpt only)\n# \"The Origin of Love\"\n# \"Sugar Daddy\"\n# \"Angry Inch\"\n# \"Wig in a Box\"\n# \"The Origin of Love\" (Tommy Gnosis version) (excerpt only)\n# \"Wicked Little Town\"\n# \"I Will Always Love You\" (excerpt only)\n# \"The Long Grift\" (excerpt only, full version on soundtrack)\n# \"Freaks\" (excerpt only, full version on soundtrack, with [[Girls Against Boys]])\n# \"In Your Arms Tonight\"\n# \"Hedwig's Lament\"\n# \"Exquisite Corpse\"\n# \"Wicked Little Town (Reprise)\"\n# \"Midnight Radio\"\n\n;Songs only on the soundtrack\n# \"Nailed\" (on soundtrack only)\n\nFor the soundtrack, Hedwig's songs were recorded by [[John Cameron Mitchell]] (lead vocals), [[Stephen Trask]], [[Miriam Shor]], [[Bob Mould]] (of [[H\u00fcsker D\u00fc]]), Ted Liscinski, Perry L.

It benefited the [[Hetrick-Martin Institute]] and was named after one of the musical's most popular songs \"Wig in a Box\". [[Goth-metal]] band [[Type O Negative (band)|Type O Negative]] recorded a cover of \"Angry Inch\" on their 2003 album ''[[Life Is Killing Me]]''.\n\n==Production==\nMitchell had been approached during the Off-Broadway run of the musical with the offer to adapt ''Hedwig'' into a film. He developed parts of the script at the [[Sundance Institute|Sundance film labs]], notably the trailer scene with Tommy Speck. Later, the film was entered into the [[Sundance Film Festival]].\n\nAccording to the [[Audio commentary|DVD commentary]], most of the lead vocals were recorded \"live\" as the scenes were shot, to capture the intensity of a live performance.<ref name=\":0\">Mitchell, John Cameron and Frank DeMarco. \"Commentary.\" ''Hedwig and the Angry Inch''.

Also in the DVD commentary, Mitchell mentions that Pitt was somewhat uncomfortable with their prolonged kissing scene, complaining about being scratched by Mitchell's stubble. Mitchell mentioned Pitt consuming onion and garlic directly before shooting the scene.\n\n==Release==\n\n===Marketing===\nMitchell and Trask performed twice on ''[[The Rosie O'Donnell Show]]'' (the second time with [[Dean DeLeo]] of [[Stone Temple Pilots]]). At first, the studio objected to a \"drag\" performance on the daytime family show, but relented at the insistence of O'Donnell. Mitchell and his band performed \"[[The Origin of Love (song)|The Origin of Love]]\". A clip from this show was used in the ''Hedwig'' film, with O'Donnell's blessing.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nMitchell said that his performance on the ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]'' as Hedwig was interesting: \"During rehearsal, a disembodied voice emanating from the control booth gently told me that I couldn't rip my wig off during the song (\"[[Tear Me Down]]\"). I asked why, but there was only silence from on high. So when we taped, I ripped it off ''after'' the song. They edited it out. I think they wanted people to think I was a woman, and not a man in drag.\"<ref>{{cite news |title='Hedwig': David Letterman |url=https://www.nytimes.com/video/multimedia/100000002905726/8216hedwig8217-david-letterman.html |newspaper=The New York Times |date=May 28, 2014 |access-date=24 February 2019 |archive-date=February 24, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190224175017/https://www.nytimes.com/video/multimedia/100000002905726/8216hedwig8217-david-letterman.html |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n===Critical reception===\nOn [[review aggregator]] [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film holds an approval rating of 92% based on 113 reviews, with an average rating of 7.9/10.
