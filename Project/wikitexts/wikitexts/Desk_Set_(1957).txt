The screenplay was written by [[Phoebe Ephron]] and [[Henry Ephron]] from the 1955 play of the same name by [[William Marchant (playwright)|William Marchant]].\n\n==Plot==\nBunny Watson is in charge of the reference library at the Federal Broadcasting Network in [[Midtown Manhattan]]. It is responsible for researching facts and answering questions from the general public on all manner of topics, great and small. She has been romantically involved for seven years with rising network executive Mike Cutler, but with no marriage in sight.\n\nMethods Engineer and [[ergonomics|efficiency expert]] Richard Sumner is the inventor of EMERAC (\"'''E'''lectromagnetic '''ME'''mory and '''R'''esearch '''A'''rithmetical '''C'''alculator\"), a powerful early generation [[computer]] (referred to then as an \u201celectronic brain\u201d).  He is brought in to see how the library functions, and size it up for installation of one of his massive machines.\n\nShucking off Bunny\u2019s initial intransigence, he is surprised and intrigued to discover how stunningly capable and engaging she is.\n\nWhen her staff finds out the computer is coming, they jump to the conclusion they are being replaced. Their fears seem to be confirmed when everyone on the staff receives a [[Pink slip (employment)|pink \u201clayoff\u201d slip]] printed out by a similar new EMERAC already installed in payroll. It turns out to have been a mistake - the machine fired everybody in the company, including the president!\n\nAfter an innocuous but seemingly salacious situation Cutler walks in on at Bunny\u2019s apartment he recognizes the older Sumner has emerged as a romantic rival, and begins to whipsaw ambivalently towards Bunny.\n\nMeanwhile, it is revealed that the network is secretly negotiating a merger with another company. It has kept everything hush-hush to avoid tipping off competitors. Rather than replace the research staff, \u201cEmmy\u201d has been installed to help the employees cope with the extra work that will result from the combined businesses.\n\nWith the threat of displacement  out of the way, Sumner reveals his romantic interest to Watson, but she believes that EMERAC will always be his first love. He denies it, but then Watson puts him to the test, pressing the machine beyond its limits. Sumner resists the urge to fix it as long as possible, but finally gives in and forces an emergency shutdown. Watson then accepts his marriage proposal.\n\n==Cast==\n{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n* [[Spencer Tracy]] as Richard Sumner\n* [[Katharine Hepburn]] as Bunny Watson\n* [[Gig Young]] as Mike Cutler\n* [[Joan Blondell]] as Peg Costello, Bunny's friend and co-worker\n* [[Dina Merrill]] as Sylvia Blair, reference desk worker\n* [[Sue Randall]] as Ruthie Saylor, reference desk worker\n* [[Neva Patterson]] as Miss Warriner\n* Harry Ellerbe as Smithers\n* Nicholas Joy as Mr. Azae\n* [[Diane Jergens]] as Alice\n* [[Merry Anders]] as Cathy\n* [[Ida Moore]] as Old Lady\n* [[Rachel Stephens]] as Receptionist\n* [[Shirley Mitchell]] as Myra Smithers\n* [[Sammy Ogg]] as Kenny mail boy (B 1939)\n}}\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Tracy Hepburn Desk Set.jpg|thumb|right|Spencer Tracy with Katharine Hepburn in a promotional image for ''Desk Set'' (1957)]]\nIn the play, Watson (played by [[Shirley Booth]], who was originally intended for the film as well) had only brief interactions with Sumner, and somewhat hostile. Screenwriters Phoebe and Henry Ephron (the parents of [[Nora Ephron]]) built up the role of the efficiency expert and tailored the interactions between him and the researcher to fit Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn.<ref>[http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/72868/Desk-Set/notes.html ''Turner Classic Movies'' Notes: Entry for ''Desk Set'']</ref>\n\nThe exterior shots of the \"Federal Broadcasting Network\" seen in the film is actually the [[Radio Corporation of America|RCA]] Building (now known as the [[Comcast]] Building) at [[30 Rockefeller Center]] in [[Rockefeller Center]], the headquarters of [[NBC]].\n\nThe character of Bunny Watson was based on Agnes E. Law, a real-life librarian at [[Columbia Broadcasting Service|CBS]] who retired about a year before the film was released.<ref>{{cite book\n  |last=Duralde\n  |first=Alonso\n  |title=Have Yourself a Movie Little Christmas\n  |page=[https://archive.org/details/haveyourselfmovi0000dura/page/61 61]\n  |location=Wisconsin\n  |publisher=Limelight Editions\n  |year=2010\n  |isbn=978-0879103767\n  |url=https://archive.org/details/haveyourselfmovi0000dura/page/61\n  }}</ref><ref>[http://fultonhistory.com/newspaper%202/Richfield%20Springs%20NY%20Mercury/Richfield%20Springs%20NY%20Mercury%201957-1958.pdf/Richfield%20Springs%20NY%20Mercury%201957-1958%20-%200198.pdf \"Former Teacher Receives Honor\" June 20, 1957.

Following ''Desk Set'' their last film together would be 1967's ''[[Guess Who's Coming to Dinner]]''.\n\nThe computer referred to as EMERAC is a [[wikt:Special:Search/homoiophone|homoiophone]] [[Metonymy|metonym]] for [[ENIAC]] (\"'''E'''lectronic '''N'''umerical '''I'''ntegrator '''A'''nd '''C'''omputer\"), which was developed in the 1940s and was the first electronic general-purpose computer. Parts of the EMERAC computer, particularly the massive display of moving square lights, would later be seen in various [[20th Century Fox]] science fiction productions, including both the [[Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea|motion picture (1961)]] and [[Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea (TV series)|TV (1964-68) versions]] of ''Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea''.\n\nThe researchers furnish incorrect information about the career of baseball player [[Ty Cobb]].  Miss Costello claims his major league career lasted for 21 years, and that he played only for the [[Detroit Tigers]].  In fact, he played for 24 years\u201422 with Detroit, and his final two seasons with the [[Philadelphia Athletics]].\n\n==Reception==\n[[Bosley Crowther]], film critic of ''[[The New York Times]]'', felt the film was \"out of dramatic kilter\", inasmuch as Hepburn was simply too \"formidable\" to convincingly play someone \"scared by a machine\", resulting in \"not much tension in this thoroughly lighthearted film\".<ref>{{cite news |title=Desk Set (1957) |author=Bosley Crowther |newspaper=The New York Times |date=May 16, 1957 |url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9D03E3D91631E63ABC4E52DFB366838C649EDE}}</ref>\n\nToday the film is seen far more favorably, with the sharpness of the script praised in particular. It has achieved a rare 100% rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on 22 reviews, with a [[weighted arithmetic mean|weighted average]] of 6.78/10. The site's consensus reads: \"''Desk Set'' reunites one of cinema's most well-loved pairings for a solidly crafted romantic comedy that charmingly encapsulates their timeless appeal\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/desk_set/|title=Desk Set|publisher=Rotten Tomatoes|access-date=30 June 2019}}</ref> Dennis Schwartz of Osuz' World Movie Reviews called it an \"inconsequential sex comedy\", but contended \"the star performers are better than the material they are given to work with\" and that \"the comedy was so cheerful and the banter between the two was so refreshingly smart that it was easy to forgive this bauble for not being as rich as many of the legendary duo's other films together.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://homepages.sover.net/~ozus/deskset.htm |title=So Refreshingly Smart |author=Dennis Schwartz |publisher=Osuz's World Movie Reviews |date=March 9, 2005 |access-date=October 1, 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\nA [[Canada|Canadian]] radio program, ''[[Bunny Watson]]'', was named for and inspired by Hepburn's character.\n\nThe film is recognized by [[American Film Institute]] in these lists:\n* 2002: [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Passions]] \u2013 Nominated<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.afi.com/Docs/100Years/passions400.pdf |title=AFI's 100 Years...100 Passions Nominees |access-date=2016-08-18}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of American films of 1957]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|Desk Set (film)}}\n* {{IMDb title|0050307}}\n* {{amg movie|13391}}\n* {{tcmdb title|id=72868}}\n* {{AFI film|52153}}\n\n{{Walter Lang}}\n{{Tracy Hepburn films}}\n\n[[Category:1957 films]]\n[[Category:1957 romantic comedy films]]\n[[Category:20th Century Fox films]]\n[[Category:American films based on plays]]\n[[Category:American romantic comedy films]]\n[[Category:Films about computing]]\n[[Category:Films about technological impact]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Walter Lang]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Cyril J.
