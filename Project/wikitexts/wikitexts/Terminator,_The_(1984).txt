It stars [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] as the [[Terminator (character)|Terminator]], a [[cyborg]] assassin sent back in time from 2029 to 1984 to kill [[Sarah Connor (Terminator)|Sarah Connor]] ([[Linda Hamilton]]), whose unborn son will one day save mankind from extinction by [[Skynet (Terminator)|Skynet]], a hostile [[artificial intelligence]] in a [[Apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction|post-apocalyptic]] future. [[Kyle Reese]] ([[Michael Biehn]]) is a soldier sent back in time to protect Sarah. The screenplay is credited to Cameron and producer [[Gale Anne Hurd]], while co-writer [[William Wisher Jr.]] received an \"additional dialogue\" credit.\n\nCameron stated he devised the premise of the film from a fever dream he experienced during the release of his first film, ''[[Piranha II: The Spawning]]'' (1982), in Rome, and developed the concept in collaboration with Wisher. He sold the rights to the project to fellow [[New World Pictures]] alumna Hurd on the condition that she would produce the film only if he were to direct it; Hurd eventually secured a distribution deal with [[Orion Pictures]], while executive producers [[John Daly (producer)|John Daly]] and Derek Gibson of [[Hemdale Film Corporation]] were instrumental in setting up the film's financing and production. Originally approached by Orion for the role of Reese, Schwarzenegger agreed to play the title character after befriending Cameron. Filming, which took place mostly at night on location in Los Angeles, was delayed because of Schwarzenegger's commitments to ''[[Conan the Destroyer]]'' (1984), during which Cameron found time to work on the scripts for ''[[Rambo: First Blood Part II]]'' (1985) and ''[[Aliens (film)|Aliens]]'' (1986). The film's special effects, which included [[miniature effect|miniatures]] and [[stop-motion animation]], were created by a team of artists led by [[Stan Winston]] and [[Gene Warren Jr.]]\n\nDefying low pre-release expectations, ''The Terminator'' topped the United States [[box office]] for two weeks, eventually grossing $78.3 million against a modest $6.4 million budget. It is credited with launching Cameron's film career and solidifying Schwarzenegger's status as a [[leading man]]. The film's success led to [[Terminator (franchise)|a franchise]] consisting of [[Terminator (franchise)#Films|several sequels]], [[Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles|a television series]], [[List of Terminator comics|comic books]], [[T2 (novel series)|novels]] and [[List of Terminator video games|video games]]. In 2008, ''The Terminator'' was selected by the [[Library of Congress]] for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] as \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Plot summaries for feature films are set between 400-700 words. Before editing this section, please see WP:FILMPLOT for more information. Thank you. -->\n\nTwo men arrive separately in 1984 [[Los Angeles]], having [[time travel]]ed from 2029. One is  a [[cyborg|cybernetic]] assassin known as the [[Terminator (character)|Terminator]], programmed to hunt and kill a woman named [[Sarah Connor (Terminator)|Sarah Connor]]. The other is a human soldier named [[Kyle Reese]], intent on stopping it. They both steal guns and clothing. The Terminator systematically kills women bearing its target's name, having found their addresses in a [[telephone directory]]. It tracks the last Sarah Connor, its actual target, to a nightclub, but Reese rescues her. The pair steal a car and escape, with the Terminator pursuing them in a stolen police car.\n\nAs they hide in a parking lot, Reese explains to Sarah that an artificially intelligent defense network known as [[Skynet (Terminator)|Skynet]], created by Cyberdyne Systems, will become self-aware in the near future and trigger a [[Nuclear holocaust|global nuclear war]] to exterminate the human race. Sarah's future son [[John Connor|John]] will rally the survivors and lead a successful [[resistance movement]] against Skynet and its army of machines. On the verge of the resistance's victory, Skynet sent the Terminator back in time to kill Sarah and prevent John from being born. The Terminator is an efficient and relentless killing machine with perfect voice-mimicking ability and a robust metal [[endoskeleton]] covered by living tissue that disguises it as a human.\n\nPolice apprehend Reese and Sarah after another encounter with the Terminator. The Terminator attacks the police station, killing police officers while hunting for Sarah. Reese and Sarah escape, steal another car, and take refuge in a motel, where they assemble [[pipe bomb]]s and plan their next move. Reese admits that he has adored Sarah since he saw her in a photograph John gave him and that he traveled through time out of love for her. Reciprocating his feelings, Sarah kisses him, and they have sex, conceiving John.\n\t\nThe Terminator locates Sarah by intercepting a call intended for her mother. She and Reese escape the motel in a pickup truck while it pursues them on a motorcycle. In the ensuing chase, Reese is wounded by gunfire while throwing pipe bombs at the Terminator. Sarah knocks the Terminator off its motorcycle but loses control of the truck, which flips over. The Terminator, now bloodied and badly damaged, hijacks a [[tank truck]] and attempts to run down Sarah, but Reese slides a pipe bomb into the tanker's hose tube, causing an explosion that burns the flesh from the Terminator's endoskeleton. It pursues them into a factory, where Reese activates machinery to confuse it. He jams his final pipe bomb into its midsection, blowing it apart at the cost of his life. Its still-functional torso grabs Sarah, but she breaks free and lures it into a [[hydraulic press]], crushing and finally destroying it.\n\nMonths later, Sarah, pregnant with John, travels through Mexico, recording [[cassette tape|audio tapes]] to pass on to him. At a gas station, a boy takes a [[instant film|polaroid]] of her, and she buys it. It is the exact photograph that John will one day give to Reese.\n\n==Cast==\n{{See also|List of Terminator (franchise) characters|l1=List of ''Terminator'' characters}}\n{{multiple image\n| align   = right\n| total_width = 500\n| image1  = Arnold Schwarzenegger by Gage Skidmore 4.jpg\n| image2  = Linda Hamilton by Gage Skidmore.jpg\n| image3  = Michael Biehn by Gage Skidmore.jpg\n| footer  = [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]], [[Linda Hamilton]] and [[Michael Biehn]] (pictured in 2019, 2019, and 2016 [[San Diego Comic-Con]], respectively) played the film's leads.\n}}\n* [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] as the [[Terminator (character)|Terminator]], a cybernetic android disguised as a human being sent back in time to assassinate Sarah Connor.\n* [[Michael Biehn]] as [[Kyle Reese]], a human Resistance fighter sent back in time to protect Sarah.\n* [[Linda Hamilton]] as [[Sarah Connor (Terminator)|Sarah Connor]], a young diner waitress and the Terminator's target, who is soon to be the mother of the future Resistance leader [[John Connor]].\n* [[Paul Winfield]] as Ed Traxler, a police Lieutenant who tries to protect Sarah.\n* [[Lance Henriksen]] as Vukovich, a member of the [[LAPD]].\n* [[Bess Motta]] as Ginger, Sarah's roommate whom the T-800 murders after mistaking her for Sarah.\n* [[Rick Rossovich]] as Matt, Ginger's boyfriend whom the T-800 also murdered.\n* [[Earl Boen]] as Dr. Silberman, a criminal [[psychologist]].\n\nAdditional actors included Shawn Schepps as Nancy, Sarah's co-worker at the diner; [[Dick Miller]] as a gun shop clerk; professional bodybuilder [[Franco Columbu]] as a Terminator in the future; [[Bill Paxton]] and [[Brian Thompson]] as punks whom the Terminator confronts and kills; [[Marianne Muellerleile]] as one of the other women with the name \"Sarah Connor\" whom the Terminator shoots; [[Rick Aiello]] as a bouncer at Tech-Noir; and [[Bill Wisher]] as the police officer who reports a hit-and-run felony on Reese, only to be knocked unconscious and have his car stolen by the Terminator soon thereafter.\n\n==Production==\n\n===Development===\n<!--development of the concept and script, as well as the securing of financing and producers -->\nIn [[Rome, Italy]], during the release of ''[[Piranha II: The Spawning]]'' (1982), director Cameron fell ill and had a dream about a metallic torso holding kitchen knives dragging itself from an explosion.<ref name=\"Keegan34\">Keegan, 2009. p. 34</ref> Inspired by director [[John Carpenter]], who had made the [[slasher film]] ''[[Halloween (1978 film)|Halloween]]'' (1978) on a low budget, Cameron used the dream as a \"launching pad\" to write a slasher-style film.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.denofgeek.com/movies/the-terminator/31391/why-the-terminator-is-a-horror-classic#ixzz38LjAc8Xn|title=Why The Terminator is a horror classic|last=Lambie|first=Ryan|work=[[Den of Geek]]|date=July 23, 2014|access-date=23 July 2014|archive-date=January 7, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200107155042/https://www.denofgeek.com/movies/the-terminator/31391/why-the-terminator-is-a-horror-classic#ixzz38LjAc8Xn|url-status=live}}</ref> Cameron's agent disliked the early concept of the horror film and requested that he work on something else.

During the waiting period, Cameron was contracted to write the script for ''[[Rambo: First Blood Part II]],'' refined the ''Terminator'' script, and met with producers [[David Giler]] and [[Walter Hill (filmmaker)|Walter Hill]] to discuss a sequel to ''[[Alien (film)|Alien]],'' which became ''[[Aliens (film)|Aliens]]'', released in 1986.<ref name=\"Keegan46\" /><ref name=\"Keegan47-79\">Keegan, 2009. pp. 47\u201349</ref>\n\nThere was limited interference from Orion Pictures.

These pieces were then sanded, painted and then chrome-plated. Winston sculpted reproduction of Schwarzenegger's face in several poses out of silicone, clay and plaster.<ref name=\"Keegan51\" />\n\nThe sequences set in 2029 and the [[Stop motion|stop-motion]] scenes were developed by Fantasy II, a special effects company headed by Gene Warren Jr.<ref name=\"French24\">French, 1996. p. 24</ref> A stop-motion model is used in several scenes in the film involving the Terminator's skeletal frame. Cameron wanted to convince the audience that the model of the structure was capable of doing what they saw Schwarzenegger doing. To allow this, a scene was filmed of Schwarzenegger injured and limping away; this limp made it easier for the model to imitate Schwarzenegger.<ref>French, 1996. pp. 25\u201326</ref>\n\nOne of the guns seen in the film and on the film's poster was an [[AMT Hardballer|AMT Longslide]] pistol modified by Ed Reynolds from [[SureFire]] to include a [[List of laser applications#Laser sight|laser sight]]. Both non-functioning and functioning versions of the prop were created. At the time the movie was made, [[Laser diode|diode lasers]] were not available; because of the high power requirement, the [[helium\u2013neon laser]] in the sight used an external power supply that Schwarzenegger had to activate manually.
