(film series)|2002 and 2004 live-action films]]), as well as the first ''Scooby-Doo'' production since ''[[Scooby-Doo and the Cyber Chase]]'' not to feature original Shaggy voice actor [[Casey Kasem]] in any capacity. This was also the last ''Scooby-Doo'' DVD to be released in Standard Version. This marked the final acting role of [[John Stephenson (actor)|John Stephenson]] before his death in 2015.\n\nThe animation is now in a different format, with a darker, more realistic look similar to ''[[Scooby-Doo on Zombie Island|Zombie Island]]'' and ''[[Scooby-Doo! and the Witch's Ghost|Witch's Ghost]]'', and the characters are now in their original outfits and designs from the ''[[Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!|Where Are You!]]'' series.\n\n==Plot==\n{{Long plot|date=March 2021}}\nAfter wrapping up their latest mystery, Velma gets a call from her mother asking she check on her younger sister Madelyn, who attends a college for magicians. The gang heads to the Whirlen Merlin Magic Academy, located in an old Irish castle. Once they reach the castle they meet the owner, Whirlen Merlin, along with his brother Marlon, who acts as cook and butler, and Crystal, Whirlen's former stage assistant. The gang learns a giant [[griffin]] has been scaring away the students and staff.\n\nLater that evening, Madelyn, who has had a crush on Shaggy for years, takes him on a romantic walk to in the gardens and show him an ancient sun-dial. Madelyn explains the gryphon was meant to protect the school, but then the gryphon chases them from the garden. The rest of the students leave, so the gang starts taking classes themselves. Meanwhile, Calvin Curdles, a powerful ice-cream guru, continually offers to buy Whirlen's castle from him. The gang promises to investigate to see if Curdles is behind the Gryphon.\n\nVelma and Daphne stumble on a secret passageway leading to the attic of the school, where they discover Alma Rumblebuns, the school's head maid, used to date Calvin Curdles. Meanwhile, Shaggy and Scooby discover the special effects room of the castle, where they are discovered by Ms. Rumblebuns and knock over some chemicals, creating a fog. Madelyn then finds a book about the ancient staff of O'Flannery, the original owner of the castle, which is said to control the gryphon. Even though Amos warns them the island where the staff rests is haunted by a [[Banshee]], the gang travels to O'Flannery's crypt and recover the staff, but they are chased away by the Banshee and narrowly escape.\n\nAfterwards, the gryphon quickly appears again. As the gang runs to the castle, Shaggy and Madelyn bump into Amos and misplace the staff with Amos' pitchfork. When Madelyn runs outside to recover the staff, she is kidnapped by the gryphon. Meanwhile, the gang finds out that Amos has been secretly working for Calvin Curdles to try to get Whirlen to sell the castle. While the gang goes to rescue Madelyn, Calvin tries to convince Whirlen to sign over the castle.\n\nThey get into the tower with the staff, but they are separated in the process when the gryphon attacks. Shaggy and Scooby are left alone while the others get help, and Shaggy discovers the staff is a key to the roost where they rescue Madelyn. But, their reunion is quickly cut short again when the gryphon attacks, but they are able to escape. Shaggy also throws the staff at the gryphon during the process, causing it to go out of control. Everybody else rushes outside including Curdles. The gryphon crashes to the ground, where they discover it is actually a giant puppet, controlled from a blimp hidden by a fog machine run by Whirlen's brother Marlon. He had discovered Lord O'Flannery had mechanical devices imitating a gryphon's beak and talons hidden in the Gryphon's Roost, hoping it would make everyone think a real gryphon lived there. Marlon fixed them, and used the devices to scare trespassers away. He was also behind the banshee, which was only a hologram.\n\nTired of doing all the real work but getting none of the credit, Marlon decided to use his puppets and illusions to become a famous magician himself, but he needed money to start and the only way was to get Whirlen to sell the castle. So, Marlon had his gryphon puppet scare everyone away. He apologizes for trying to make Whirlen fail, knowing how much the school meant to him, not wanting to take away his dream. Whirlen forgives Marlon, and all is well. Velma reveals Amos found Marlon rebuilding the Gryphon and told Curdles about it. Curdles reveals he wanted to buy the castle to win back Alma's heart.\n\nAlma accepts him back and they become a couple again. The Merlin brothers decide to make Madelyn their apprentice and soon after Calvin Curdles sponsors the reopening of the Merlin Brothers' Academy of Magic, where Madelyn performs with Daphne Blake acting as her assistant.\n\n==Voice cast==\n* [[Frank Welker]] as [[Fred Jones (Scooby-Doo)|Fred Jones]] and [[Scooby-Doo (character)|Scooby-Doo]]\n* [[Matthew Lillard]] as [[Shaggy Rogers]]\n* [[Grey DeLisle]] as [[Daphne Blake]]\n* [[Mindy Cohn]] as [[Velma Dinkley]]\n* [[Danica McKellar]] as Madelyn Dinkley\n* [[James Patrick Stuart]] as Whirlen Merlin\n* [[Brian Posehn]] as Marlon Merlin\n* [[Diane Delano]] as Alma Rumblebuns \n* [[Jeffrey Tambor]] as Calvin Curdles\n* Crystal Scales as Crystal\n* [[John DiMaggio]] as Amos\n* [[Dave Attell]] as G.P.S.\n* [[Olivia Hack]] as Treena\n* [[Dee Bradley Baker]] as Sherman\n* Melique Berger as Maxwell's Mother\n* [[John Stephenson (actor)|John Stephenson]] as Sheriff\n\n==EP==\nAn [[Extended play|EP]] [[soundtrack]] was released exclusively to [[iTunes Store]]s in the U.S. on September 14, 2010.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/scooby-doo!-abracadabra-doo/id385204809|title=Scooby Doo!
