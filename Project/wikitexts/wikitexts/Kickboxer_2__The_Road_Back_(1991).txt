Goyer]]. The film is the second entry into the [[Kickboxer (film series)|''Kickboxer'' film series]], and stars [[Sasha Mitchell]] in the role of David Sloan (unlike Sloane in the first film), the brother of ''Kickboxer''{{'}}s lead character Kurt, portrayed by [[Jean-Claude Van Damme]].\n\n==Plot==\nOne year after the events of the first film, it is revealed that kickboxing brothers Kurt and Eric Sloane have been killed by Tong Po in Thailand shortly after his loss to Kurt. David Sloan, the last surviving brother, struggles to keep the family's Los Angeles [[kickboxing]] gym afloat with his business partner, Jack. He offers free kickboxing lessons to local kids, often demonstrating a technique he calls the \"rock and the river\" which allows him to defend against attacks while blindfolded.\n\nAlthough his will to compete has waned since the loss of his brothers, financial problems eventually force David to fight again in a new organization run by a crooked promoter, Justin Maciah. His surprising comeback ultimately attracts the attention of Po who, disgraced by his previous defeat to Kurt, seeks to defeat David in the ring and regain his honor. But when David announces his retirement after a victory against Neil Vargas, Po's manager Sanga (who is later revealed as helping to fund Maciah's kickboxing organization) hires a group of thugs to burn down the gym; Vargas goes with them to enact petty revenge for his defeat. Although David attempts to fight them off, he is beaten down and suffers a gunshot wound to the leg. The injury prevents him from aiding a young student trapped in the blaze, who dies as a result.\n\nWhile recovering in the hospital, David is visited by Xian Chow, the Muay Thai Kru who trained his brother Kurt in [[Thailand]]. Though David initially wants nothing to do with him, he finally relents and allows Xian to nurse him back to health. Meanwhile, one of David's most promising students, Brian Wagner, has secured a championship bout and invites David to watch the fight. However, the champion is unexpectedly replaced by Po, as a part of a deal made between Maciah and Sanga. Tong Po pummels Wagner with illegal blows and kills him in the ring despite David's efforts to intervene. The bout leaves Justin in financial and professional ruin, while Sanga declares their partnership is over. Afterwards, Xian reveals to David that the main reason he is helping him is because Tong Po had also murdered his niece Mylee along with David's brothers. He guiltily admits that part of him wants revenge for her death, and is willing to sacrifice David to get it.\n\nInsisting that the fight is his own, David accepts Po's challenge. In a bloody bout reminiscent of the \"ancient way\" of fighting in Thailand, (using tape covered in resin and broken glass) David is beaten badly and has clouded vision. Utilizing his \"rock and the river\" technique, however, David gains the upper hand and ultimately defeats his rival. Having lost his honor, Sanga confronts David in the ring at gunpoint, but thanks to a distraction by his friend Jack, David is able to disarm and incapacitate him.\n\nThe next day, David unsuccessfully teaches Xian to drive a car. When his students introduce him to the new neighborhood bully, David once again demonstrates the \"rock and the river\", but the lesson is cut short when the ice cream truck arrives, and Xian treats the kids.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Sasha Mitchell]] as David Sloan\n* [[Peter Boyle]] as Justin Maciah\n* Dennis Chan as Xian Chow, David's Muay Thai Kru\n* [[Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa]] as Sanga\n* [[John Diehl]] as Jack\n* [[Michel Qissi]] as \"Tiger\" Tong Po\n* [[Heather McComb]] as Jo\n* [[Vince Murdocco]] as Brian Wagner\n* [[Vincent Klyn]] as Thai Thug\n* [[Gene LeBell]] as The Referee\n* Don Familton as Brian's Cornerman\n* [[Matthias Hues]] as Neil Vargas\n* Humberto Ortiz as Joey\n* Emmanuel Kervyn as Kurt Sloane\n* [[Casey Stengel]] as Eric Sloane\n* Joe Restivo as The Ring Announcer\n* [[Brian Austin Green]] as Tommy\n* Brent Kelly as Carl\n* Amy Arthur as Kristen Wagner\n* Annie O'Donnell as Mrs. Wagner\n* Robert Gottlieb as Lou Lescano\n* Debrae Barensfeld as Maciah's Girlfriend\n* Ed Anders as Brian's Opponent\n\n==Release==\n===Theatrical===\n''Kickboxer 2'' was given a [[limited release]] theatrically in the United States by [[Trimark Pictures]] in June 1991, grossing $1,250,712 at the box office.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=kickboxer2.htm|title=Kickboxer 2|publisher=boxofficemojo.com|date=April 7, 2011}}</ref>\n\n===Home media===\n[[HBO Home Video]] released it on [[VHS]] and [[laserdisc]] the same year.
