It mostly focuses on John Mark Byers, the father of one of the victims who has grown increasingly obsessed with the West Memphis Three, and on a support group who is convinced that the three are innocent. The film was nominated for a [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Documentary or Nonfiction Special|Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Nonfiction Special]], and was later followed by a third film, ''[[Paradise Lost 3: Purgatory]]'', in 2011.\n\n==Description==\nIn ''Paradise Lost 2'', [[Bruce Sinofsky]] and [[Joe Berlinger]] visit support groups for [[Damien Echols]], sentenced to [[lethal injection]] in the first film, and revisit [[John Mark Byers]], who is facing gossip about his possible involvement with the murder of his son. Echols is appealing his sentence and his defense attorney notices what he believes to be bite marks in a photograph of the face of one of the victims; the prosecution argues that the marks are from a belt buckle and not teeth.\n\nThe three boys convicted in the first film are all tested and do not match the alleged \"bite marks\" on the victim.  The support groups for Echols want Byers to have his bitemark compared to the one on the photo, but Byers has had false teeth since four years after his son's murder. Byers gave the Defense copies of his dental records and they didn't match the \"bite marks\" either. Byers takes a [[polygraph]] to prove his innocence but is on a variety of medications that could affect the outcome of the test, including [[Alprazolam|Xanax]] and [[Haldol]]; he passes the polygraph test.<ref name=Ebert />\n\n==Production==\n[[Metallica]] allowed their music to be used in the movie.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1432105/19980528/metallica.jhtml | title=Metallica May Give Music To \"Paradise Lost\" Sequel |publisher=[[MTV]] | date=May 28, 1998  | access-date = 2010-11-24}}</ref> Another sequel was produced: ''[[Paradise Lost 3: Purgatory]]'', which was initially scheduled for release in autumn 2011, but was delayed until January 2012 after the [[West Memphis Three]] were released from prison while the film was in post-production, requiring new material to be added, and ''[[West of Memphis]]'', which was released at the [[Sundance Film Festival]] days after Paradise Lost 3 aired on HBO and, based on new evidence, implicates a new suspect in the murders at Robin Hood Hills.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1632489/20100223/story.jhtml | title='Paradise Lost' Team Plans Two More West Memphis Three Documentaries |publisher=[[MTV]] | date=Feb 23, 2010  | access-date = 2010-11-24}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n*[https://www.hbo.com/documentaries/paradise-lost-2-revelations ''Paradise Lost 2: Revelations''] at [[HBO]]\n*{{IMDb title|0239894}}\n*{{curlie|Arts/Movies/Titles/P/Paradise_Lost_Movies/|''Paradise Lost'' movies}}\n\n{{Joe Berlinger and Bruce Sinofsky}}\n{{HBO documentaries}}\n{{West Memphis Three}}\n\n[[Category:2000 films]]\n[[Category:American documentary films]]\n[[Category:Films about miscarriage of justice]]\n[[Category:Films set in Arkansas]]\n[[Category:Documentary films about crime in the United States]]\n[[Category:HBO documentary films]]\n[[Category:West Memphis Three]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Bruce Sinofsky]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Joe Berlinger]]\n[[Category:2000 documentary films]]\n[[Category:Films produced by Joe Berlinger]]\n[[Category:2000s English-language films]]\n[[Category:2000s American films]]"}]}}}}
