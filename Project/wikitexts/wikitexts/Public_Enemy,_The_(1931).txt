Wellman]] and stars [[James Cagney]], [[Jean Harlow]], [[Edward Woods]], [[Donald Cook (actor)|Donald Cook]] and [[Joan Blondell]]. The film relates the story of a young man's rise in the [[organized crime|criminal underworld]] in [[Prohibition in the United States|prohibition]]-era urban America. The supporting players include [[Beryl Mercer]], [[Murray Kinnell]], and [[Mae Clarke]]. The screenplay is based on an unpublished novel\u2014''Beer and Blood'' by two former newspapermen, [[John Bright (screenwriter)|John Bright]] and [[Kubec Glasmon]]\u2014who had witnessed some of [[Al Capone]]'s murderous gang rivalries in [[Chicago]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Whiteley |first1=Chris |title=The Public Enemy (1931) |url=http://www.hollywoodsgoldenage.com/movies/the_public_enemy.html |website=Hollywood's Golden Age 2010-18 |access-date=June 10, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://catalog.afi.com/Catalog/moviedetails/3860?sid|title=AFI&#124;Catalog|website=catalog.afi.com}}</ref> In 1998, ''The Public Enemy'' was selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".\n\n==Plot==\n[[File:Cagney Harlow The Public Enemy Publicity.jpg|thumb|left|[[James Cagney]], [[Jean Harlow]], [[Leslie Fenton]] in a [[publicity still]] for the film.]]\nAs youngsters in 1900s [[Chicago]], Irish-Americans Tom Powers and his lifelong friend Matt Doyle engage in petty theft, selling stolen items to \"Putty Nose\". Putty Nose persuades them to join his gang on a fur warehouse robbery, assuring them he will take care of them if anything goes wrong. When Tom is startled by a stuffed bear, he shoots it, alerting the police, who kill gang member Larry Dalton. Chased by a cop, Tom and Matt gun him down. However, when they go to Putty Nose for help, they find he has left town.\n\nTom's straitlaced older brother Mike Powers tries and fails to talk Tom into giving up crime. Tom keeps his activities secret from his doting mother. When America enters [[United States in World War I|World War I]] in 1917, Mike enlists in the Marines.\n\nIn 1920, with [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]] about to go into effect, Paddy Ryan recruits Tom and Matt as beer \"salesmen\" (enforcers) in his [[Rum-runner|bootlegging]] business. He allies himself with noted gangster Samuel \"Nails\" Nathan. As the bootlegging business becomes ever more lucrative, Tom and Matt flaunt their wealth.\n\nMike finds out that his brother's money comes not from politics, as Tom claims, but from bootlegging, and declares that Tom's success is based on nothing more than \"beer and blood\". Tom retorts in disgust: \"Your hands ain't so clean. You killed and liked it. You didn't get them medals for holding hands with them Germans.\"\n\nTom and Matt acquire girlfriends, Kitty and Mamie, respectively. Tom eventually tires of Kitty; when she complains once too often, he angrily pushes half a grapefruit into her face. He then drops her for Gwen Allen. At a restaurant on the night of Matt's wedding reception to Mamie, Tom and Matt recognize Putty Nose and follow him home. Begging for his life, Putty plays a song on the piano that he had entertained Tom and Matt with when they were children. Tom shoots him in the back.\n\nTom gives his mother a large wad of money, but Mike rejects the gift. Tom tears up the banknotes and throws them in his brother's face. \"Nails\" Nathan dies in a horse-riding accident, prompting Tom to find the horse and shoot it. A rival gang headed by \"Schemer\" Burns takes advantage of the disarray resulting from Nathan's death, precipitating a gang war.\n\nLater, Matt is gunned down in public, with Tom narrowly escaping the same fate. Furious, Tom takes it upon himself to single-handedly settle scores with Burns and some of his men. Tom is seriously wounded in the shootout and ends up in the hospital. When his mother, brother, and Matt's sister Molly come to see him, he reconciles with Mike and agrees to reform. However, Paddy warns Mike that Tom has been kidnapped by the Burns mob from the hospital. Later, his dead body is returned to the Powers home.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[James Cagney]] as Tom Powers\n* [[Jean Harlow]] as Gwen Allen\n* [[Edward Woods]] as Matt Doyle\n* [[Joan Blondell]] as Mamie\n* [[Donald Cook (actor)|Donald Cook]] as Mike Powers\n* [[Leslie Fenton]] as Nails Nathan\n* [[Beryl Mercer]] as Ma Powers\n* [[Robert Emmett O'Connor]] as Paddy Ryan\n* [[Murray Kinnell]] as Putty Nose\n* [[Mae Clarke]] as Kitty (uncredited) \n* [[Frank Coghlan Jr.]] as Tom as a Boy (uncredited) \n* [[Frankie Darro]] as Matt as a Boy (uncredited) \n* [[Robert Homans]] as Officer Pat Burke (uncredited) \n* [[Sam McDaniel]] as Headwaiter (uncredited)\n* [[William H.

Thew was based on a novel which was never published called ''Beer and Blood'', by [[John Bright (screenwriter)|John Bright]] and [[Kubec Glasmon]]. Bright and Glasmon based their novel on actual people, having witnessed some of [[Al Capone]]'s murderous gang rivalries in [[Chicago]]. [[Warner Bros.]] studio head [[Darryl F. Zanuck]] bought the rights to the novel and assigned director [[William A. Wellman]] to direct the film. Wellman, who had served in World War I like the brother of the main character, told Zanuck: \"I'll bring you the toughest, most violent picture you ever did see\".\n\n===Casting===\n[[Edward Woods]] was originally cast in the lead role of Tom Powers and [[James Cagney]] was cast as Tom's best friend Matt Doyle, until director Wellman decided Cagney would be more effective in the part and switched the two actors<ref name=greatest_films/> but never reshot the sequences with the characters as children, which is why the child playing Cagney's role looks like Woods while the one playing Woods' role looks like Cagney. Another reason for the switch is that the sound technology used in ''The Public Enemy'' was superior to that used in earlier films, making it no longer imperative to have an actor in the lead role who had impeccable enunciation.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}\n\n[[Louise Brooks]] was the original choice for Gwen Allen, a woman with self-confessed weakness for bad men. She refused the role, which went to a younger actress, [[Jean Harlow]]. Brooks' name was in studio records/casting call lists playing \"Bess\" in this movie, but she and her character did not appear. Brooks later explained herself to Wellman (who had directed her in ''[[Beggars of Life]]'' (1928)) by saying that she hated making pictures because she simply \"hated [[Hollywood (film industry)|Hollywood]]\".<ref name=\"paris359\">Paris (1989), p. 359</ref> In the opinion of Brooks's biographer [[Barry Paris]], \"turning down ''Public Enemy'' marked the real end of Louise Brooks's film career\".<ref name=\"paris359\"/>\n\nTom's first girlfriend Kitty was played by [[Mae Clarke]], who was uncredited. Kitty is eventually dropped off by Tom for Gwen after he pushes half a grapefruit into her face, the most famous scene in the movie. [[Joan Blondell]] played Mamie, Matt's girlfriend. She had already worked with Cagney in ''[[Sinners' Holiday]]'' (1930) and would work with him on two films which also came out this year: ''[[Other Men's Women]]'' and ''[[Blonde Crazy]]''. Other films that they worked together on were ''[[The Crowd Roars (1932 film)|The Crowd Roars]]'' (1932), ''[[Footlight Parade]]'' (1933) and ''[[He Was Her Man]]'' (1934). Cagney once said that Blondell was the only woman he loved besides his wife. [[Donald Cook (actor)|Donald Cook]] played Tom's brother, Mike.\n\n===Filming===\nFilming took place in January and February 1931, with a small budget of $151,000.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0022286/business|title=Business Data for The Public Enemy (1931)|access-date=December 9, 2006|work=[[IMDb]]}}</ref> During filming, Cagney also made ''[[Smart Money (1931 film)|Smart Money]]'', co-starring [[Edward G. Robinson]], who had finished his breakthrough film ''[[Little Caesar (film)|Little Caesar]]''.\n\nIn the scene where Mike Powers punches his brother Tom,  Wellman privately took Donald Cook aside and, explaining his desire for authenticity in Tom's reaction, asked the actor to really hit Cagney. Cook played his part a bit too well, and he struck Cagney in the mouth with such force, he actually broke one of Cagney's teeth.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} Yet in spite of his genuine shock and pain, Cagney stayed in character and played out the rest of the scene. In another incident, live ammunition was used in a scene where Tom Powers ducks around the corner of a building to take cover from machine gun fire; the use of live ammunition was common practice at the time.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} The bullets struck the wall of the building at the position where Cagney's head had been just a moment before.<ref>Watson, Teresa.

Since she always had a grapefruit for breakfast, he always wanted to put the grapefruit into her face just to get a reaction out of her, so she would show some emotion; he felt that this scene gave him the opportunity to rid himself of that temptation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.filmlinc.com/fcm/online/wellmanextra.htm|title=1978 interview with Wellman|access-date=June 5, 2008|work=Film Comment|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080609102549/http://www.filmlinc.com/fcm/online/wellmanextra.htm|archive-date=June 9, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/653428/the-men-who-made-the-movies-william-wellman#overview|title=The Men Who Made the Movies: William Wellman|access-date=September 17, 2022|work=[[Turner Classic Movies]]}}</ref>\n\nSome, such as film critic [[Ben Mankiewicz]], have asserted that Mae Clarke's surprised and seemingly somewhat angry reaction to the grapefruit was genuine, as she had not been told to expect the unscripted action.<ref>[[Turner Classic Movies]] (October 17, 2010). ''The Public Enemy''</ref> However, in her autobiography, Clarke stated that Cagney had told her prior to that take what he planned to do.
