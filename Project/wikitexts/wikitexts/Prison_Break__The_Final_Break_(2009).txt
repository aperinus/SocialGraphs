The movie covers the events which occurred in between the downfall of [[The Company (Prison Break)|The Company]], and the revelation of [[Michael Scofield]]'s ([[Wentworth Miller]]) death. It details the manipulated arrest and incarceration of [[Sara Tancredi]] ([[Sarah Wayne Callies]]) for the murder of Christina Scofield, the final escape plan which Michael devises for Sara, and the details surrounding Michael's death. It also reveals the ultimate fate of [[Gretchen Morgan]] ([[Jodi Lyn O'Keefe]]). This was the initial ending for Prison Break, until the release of [[Prison Break (season 5)|season 5]].\n\n== Plot ==\nSara is arrested for the murder of [[Christina Rose Scofield|Christina (Scofield) Hampton]]. She is held in the Miami-Dade State Penitentiary, where overcrowding necessitates that the female prison and jail inmates are housed in the same building. Prisoner [[Gretchen Morgan]] watches from a distance.<ref name=s416>\"[[The Sunshine State (Prison Break)|The Sunshine State]]\", ''Prison Break'' season 4 episode 16.</ref> Across the yard, Krantz and [[Theodore \"T-Bag\" Bagwell|T-Bag]] are being held in the men's facility.\n\nThe General offers a $100,000 bounty for Sara's death. Sara is poisoned, but is saved by the prison doctor, who informs her that her baby will be taken away shortly after its birth.\n\n[[Michael Scofield|Michael]] asks Warden Simms to protect Sara, but she refuses. Michael decides that he must break Sara out, enlisting [[Lincoln Burrows]] and [[Fernando Sucre]]'s help. Gretchen sees Lincoln and Sucre scoping out the prison, and demands Sara include her in any escape.\n\nMichael discovers a blind spot in the security cameras. [[Alexander Mahone]], offered reinstatement with the FBI if he finds evidence incriminating Michael, offers to help Michael. FBI Agent Todd Wheatley breaks into Michael's apartment and sees the prison diagrams. When Michael returns, he says he was looking for weaknesses to report to Simms in the hopes that she grants him visitation.\n\nSara's attorney secures a court order allowing Michael to visit. Leaving the prison, he sees the cameras being adjusted to eliminate the blind spot.\n\nSara joins the \"Family\" of inmate Daddy, who gets her work in the motor pool, making Wife and other Family members suspicious.\n\nMichael devises a new plan based on parachuting into the prison. Lincoln offer T-Bag $5,000 to help by setting off a fire alarm. T-Bag demands $100,000, suggesting they rob the bounty money from the General's agent, Joe Daniels. Lincoln and Sucre carry out the theft.\n\nGretchen kills a Family member who is attacking Sara. Gretchen again demands Sara include her in the escape because she wishes to see her daughter, Emily, and give her a gift. Daddy becomes infuriated when she hears what Sara and Gretchen have done.\n\nIt is revealed that Mahone has informed Wheatley about Michael's parachute plot. Michael continues to trust Mahone, giving him material to pass to Sara in the event of his death. Michael visits Sara and cryptically tells her the new plan; she must get to the chapel, which Michael has discovered has an emergency escape tunnel.\n\nJust before the escape begins, Gretchen distracts a guard, and Sara confronts Daddy. Sara pushes Daddy into inmate Skittlez, instigating a larger altercation. Gretchen grabs the guard's keys, then hides in the kitchen with Sara.\n\nHaving been tipped off, Wheatley orders all lights shut off and positions armed officers near Michael's planned landing site. They shoot the parachutist, which turns out to be a dummy, while Michael sneaks out from under Wheatley's car.\n\nGretchen is spotted by guards, but she stalls them and covers Sara's presence, who makes it into the chapel. The guards take Gretchen away, but Sara retrieves the necklace that Gretchen made for Emily.\n\nMichael reaches Sara, and they wait for T-Bag to get confirmation of the $100,000 and trip the fire alarm. Sucre reaches the money transfer store to find it closed; when T-Bag finds out that the money wasn't deposited, he reveals the plot to Simms. Wheatley responds by turning off the fire alarm and other systems that could cover escape noises.\n\nMichael had predicted T-Bag's double-cross. With the alarms off, he burns through a locked door with a blowtorch. When the electronic lock on the next door stymies him, he instructs Sara to proceed as he goes elsewhere to short circuit the door. Sara refuses, but Michael emphasizes that this allows her to keep their baby. Michael is electrocuted while causing the short circuit. Sara escapes to a waiting Lincoln, Sucre, and Mahone. Mahone reveals he was part of Michael's true plan, and that Michael knew it required the deadly short circuit.\n\nWhen Lincoln and Sara board a boat to the Dominican Republic, Sucre gives Sara the $100,000. Mahone gives Sara and Lincoln the material from Michael. On the boat, the two watch Michael's video, where he tells then that his terminal brain tumor had returned. He asks Lincoln to always be there for the child, and he asks Sara to watch out for Lincoln.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{See also|List of Prison Break characters}}\n\n===Starring===\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Dominic Purcell]] as [[Lincoln Burrows]]\n* [[Wentworth Miller]] as [[Michael Scofield]] \n* [[Amaury Nolasco]] as [[Fernando Sucre]]\n* [[Robert Knepper]] as [[Theodore \"T-Bag\" Bagwell]]\n* [[Jodi Lyn O'Keefe]] as [[Gretchen Morgan]]\n* [[Sarah Wayne Callies]] as [[Sara Tancredi]]\n* [[William Fichtner]] as [[Alexander Mahone]]\n}}\n\n===Guest starring===\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Leon Russom]] as [[List of Prison Break minor characters#Jonathan Krantz|General Jonathan Krantz]]\n* [[Chris Bruno]] as FBI Agent Todd Wheatley\n* [[Barbara Eve Harris]] as [[List of Prison Break minor characters#Felicia Lang|FBI Agent Felicia Lang]]\n* [[Kim Coates]] as [[List of Prison Break minor characters#Richard Sullins|Richard Sullins]]\n* [[Aisha Hinds]] as Guard Cowler\n* [[Lori Petty]] as \"Daddy\"\n* [[David Starzyk]] as Blue Phillips \n* [[Amy Aquino]] as Warden Alice Simms\n*Dendrie Taylor as Guard\n* Richmond Arquette as Attorney Joe Daniels\n*Damien Leake as Detective Marlin\n* [[Alicia Lagano]] as Agatha Warren\n* [[Joseph Will]] as Doctor\n* Sufe Bradshaw as Wife\n* [[Dot-Marie Jones]] as Skittlez (credited as Dot Marie Jones)\n* Rainbow Borden as Seags\n* Livia Trivino as Hucks\n* Ian Patrick Williams as Bearded man\n* Peggy Dunne as Guard\n}}\n\n== Release ==\nIn the [[United States]] and [[Canada]], the movie was first released on DVD and Blu-ray on July 21, 2009.
