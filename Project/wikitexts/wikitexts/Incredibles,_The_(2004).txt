However, Bob's desire to help people draws the entire family into a confrontation with a vengeful fan-turned-foe.\n\nBird, who was Pixar's first outside director, developed the film as an extension of the 1960s comic books and [[spy film]]s from his boyhood and personal family life. He pitched the film to Pixar after [[Warner Bros.]]' box office disappointment of his first feature, ''[[The Iron Giant]]'' (1999), and carried over much of its staff to develop ''The Incredibles''. The animation team was tasked with animating an all-human cast, which required creating new technology to animate detailed human anatomy, clothing, and realistic skin and hair. [[Michael Giacchino]] composed the [[The Incredibles (film score)|film's orchestral score]].\n\n''The Incredibles'' debuted at the [[El Capitan Theatre]] on October 24, 2004, and was released in theaters in the United States on November 5. It earned $632{{nbsp}}million worldwide, finishing its theatrical run as the [[2004 in film#Highest-grossing films|fourth-highest-grossing film of 2004]]. ''The Incredibles'' received widespread acclaim from critics and audiences, with praise for its animation, screenplay, action sequences, humor, voice acting, themes, music, and appeal to different age groups, and is frequently considered to be one of the greatest superhero movies of all time. It won two [[Academy Awards]] for [[Academy Award for Best Animated Feature|Best Animated Feature]] and [[Academy Award for Best Sound Editing|Best Sound Editing]] with two additional nominations for [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay|Best Original Screenplay]] and [[Academy Award for Best Sound Mixing|Best Sound Mixing]], as well as winning the [[Annie Award for Best Animated Feature]]. It was the first entirely animated film to win the prestigious [[Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation]]. A sequel, ''[[Incredibles 2]]'', was released in June 2018.\n\n== Plot ==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 to 700 words. Current wordcount 602. Please check wordcount with each edit/addition. -->\nOn the day of his wedding with [[Elastigirl|Helen Truax]] (alias Elastigirl), [[Bob Parr (The Incredibles)|Bob Parr]] (alias Mr. Incredible) rescues Oliver Sansweet from committing suicide by tackling him through a window of a skyscraper. Discovering supervillain Bomb Voyage robbing the building, Bob confronts him, but is distracted by his devoted fan [[Syndrome (The Incredibles)|Buddy Pine]] pretending to be his sidekick \"Incrediboy\". After Bob rejects Buddy, Bomb Voyage clips a bomb to Buddy's cloak. Bob pulls the bomb off, but it destroys an [[elevated train|el-train]] track, though Bob manages to stop the train from falling off.\n\nAfter Bob and Helen marry, Sansweet and the train passengers sue Bob for collateral damage. These lawsuits spread to other superheroes, turning public opinion against them, and the government initiates the Superhero Relocation Program, forcing \"supers\" to adhere to their secret identities and abandon their exploits.\n\nFifteen years later, Bob and Helen live with their children, [[Violet Parr|Violet]], [[Dash Parr|Dash]], and baby [[Jack-Jack]], in Metroville. Although he loves his family, Bob resents the mundanity of his suburban lifestyle and job as an [[claims adjuster]], and [[side job|moonlights]] as a [[vigilante]] with his best friend [[Lucius Best]], formerly known as Frozone.\n\nOne day, after his supervisor prevents him from stopping a mugging, a frustrated Bob injures him and is dismissed. A woman named [[Mirage (The Incredibles)|Mirage]] secretly offers him a mission to destroy a savage multi-limbed robot called the [[Omnidroid]] on Nomanisan island. Bob succeeds by manipulating the machine into ripping out its power source. Rejuvenated by the action and pay, Bob trains to get back in shape while awaiting another assignment. He visits superhero costume designer [[Edna Mode]] when he discovers a tear in his super-suit. Incorrectly assuming Helen knows Bob's new job, Edna makes new suits for the Parrs.\n\nBack on Nomanisan, Bob discovers Mirage is working for Buddy. Now wealthy and calling himself Syndrome, he has invented many devices that mimic superpowers. He has been perfecting the Omnidroid by hiring superheroes to fight it, killing them in the process. Syndrome intends to send a rebuilt Omnidroid to Metroville, where he will secretly manipulate its controls to defeat it publicly. He then plans to sell his inventions to the world to make the term \"super\" irrelevant.\n\nHelen visits Edna and learns what Bob has been up to. To find Bob, Helen activates a [[homing beacon|beacon]] Edna built into the suits, inadvertently causing Bob to be captured while infiltrating Syndrome's base. Helen borrows a private plane to fly to Nomanisan. Violet and Dash stow away, leaving Jack-Jack with babysitter Kari. Despite knowing that the children are on the plane, Syndrome shoots it down, but Helen and the kids escape to the island. Syndrome also reveals his indifference to Mirage's life, and a disillusioned Mirage releases Bob and informs him of his family's survival. Syndrome's guards pursue Dash and Violet, who fend them off with their powers and reunite with their parents. Syndrome imprisons the family while he transports the Omnidroid to Metroville.\n\nThe Parrs escape to Metroville with Mirage's help. The Omnidroid shoots the remote control off Syndrome's wrist and knocks him unconscious. The Parrs and Lucius fight the Omnidroid; Helen and the kids retrieve the remote control, allowing Bob to destroy the robot's power source. Returning home, the Parrs find Syndrome retaliating by abducting Jack-Jack, with the intention of raising him as a sidekick. As Syndrome flies up toward his plane, Jack-Jack's superpowers manifest, and he escapes in midair. Helen catches the baby, while Bob knocks Syndrome into one of his plane's engines.<!-- Syndrome's death is only implied, not explicity shown. -->\n\nThree months later, the Parrs witness the arrival of supervillain the Underminer.

He brought up a core group of people he worked with on ''The Iron Giant''. Because of this, many 2D artists had to make the shift to [[3D computer graphics|3D]], including Bird himself. Bird found working with [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] \"wonderfully malleable\" in a way that traditional animation is not, calling the camera's ability to easily switch angles in a given scene \"marvelously adaptable.\" He found working in computer animation \"difficult\" in a different way than working traditionally, finding the software \"sophisticated and not particularly friendly.\"<ref name=\"aniworld\" /> Bird wrote the script without knowing the limitations or concerns that went hand-in-hand with the medium of computer animation. As a result, this was to be the most complex film yet for Pixar.<ref name=\"dvdint1\" /> The film's characters were designed by Tony Fucile and [[Teddy Newton]], whom Bird had brought with him from Warner Bros.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=223}} Like most computer-animated films, ''The Incredibles'' had a year-long period of building the film from the inside out: modeling the exterior and understanding controls that would work the face and the body\u2014the articulation of the character\u2014before animation could even begin.<ref name=\"aniworld\" /> Bird and Fucile tried to emphasize the graphic quality of good 2D animation to the Pixar team, who had only worked primarily in CGI. Bird attempted to incorporate teaching from [[Disney's Nine Old Men]] that the crew at Pixar had \"never really emphasized.\"<ref name=\"aniworld\">{{cite web |url=http://www.awn.com/articles/reviews/brad-bird-pixar-tackle-cg-humans-true-superheroes |title=Brad Bird & Pixar Tackle CG Humans Like True Superheroes |publisher=AnimationWorld |date=November 5, 2004 |access-date=July 31, 2012 |author=Bill Desowitz}}</ref>\n\nFor the technical crew members, the film's human characters posed a difficult set of challenges.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=222}} Bird's story was filled with elements that were difficult to animate with CGI back then. Humans are widely considered to be the most difficult things to execute in animation.

Although the technical team had some experience with hair and cloth in ''[[Monsters, Inc.]]'' (2001), the amount of hair and cloth required for ''The Incredibles'' had never been done by Pixar up until this point. Moreover, Bird would tolerate no compromises for the sake of technical simplicity. Where the technical team on ''Monsters, Inc.'' had persuaded director [[Pete Docter]] to accept pigtails on Boo to make her hair easier to animate, the character Violet had to have long hair that obscured her face; in fact, this was integral to her character.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=222}} Violet's long hair, which was extremely difficult to animate, was only successfully animated toward the end of production. In addition, animators had to adapt to having hair both underwater and blowing through the wind.<ref name=\"aniworld\" /> Disney was initially reluctant to make the film because of these issues, thinking that a live-action film would be preferable, but Lasseter denied this.{{sfn|Paik|2007|p=238\u2013251}}\n\n{{Quote box\n|quote = ''The Incredibles'' was everything that computer-generated animation had trouble doing. It had human characters, it had hair, it had water, it had fire, it had a massive number of sets. The creative heads were excited about the idea of the film, but once I showed story reels of exactly what I wanted, the technical teams turned white. They took one look and thought, \u201cThis will take ten years and cost $500 million. How are we possibly going to do this?\u201d\n\nSo I said, \u201cGive us the black sheep. I want artists who are frustrated. I want the ones who have another way of doing things that nobody's listening to.

Another team, dubbed the \"character team,\" digitally sculpted, rigged, and shaded all of the characters, and a simulation team was responsible for developing simulation technology for hair and clothing.<ref name=\"aniworld\" /> There were at least 781 visual effects shots in the film, and they were quite often visual gags, such as the window shattering when Bob angrily shuts the car door. Additionally, the effects team improved their modeling of clouds, using volumetric rendering for the first time.<ref name=\"aniworld\" />\n\nThe skin of the characters gained a new level of realism from a technology to mimic \"[[subsurface scattering]].\"{{sfn|Price|2008|p=223}} The challenges did not stop with modeling humans. Bird decided that in a shot near the film's end, baby Jack-Jack would have to undergo a series of transformations, and in one of the five planned he would turn himself into a kind of goo. Technical directors, who anticipated spending two months or even longer to work out the goo effect, stealing precious hours from production that had already entered its final and most critical stages, petitioned the film's producer, John Walker, for help. Bird, who had himself brought Walker over from Warner Bros. to work on the project, was at first immovable, but after arguing with Walker in several invective-laced meetings over the course of two months, Bird finally conceded.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=224}} Bird also insisted that the [[storyboard]]s define the blocking of characters' motions, lighting, and camera movements, which had previously been left to other departments rather than storyboarded.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=222}}\n\nBird admitted that he \"had the knees of [the studio] trembling under the weight\" of ''The Incredibles'', but called the film a \"testament to the talent of the animators at Pixar,\" who were admiring the challenges the film provoked.<ref name=\"aniworld\" /> He recalled, \"Basically, I came into a wonderful studio, frightened a lot of people with how many presents I wanted for Christmas, and then got almost everything I asked for.\"{{sfn|Paik|2007|p=238\u2013251}}\n\n=== Music ===\n{{Main|The Incredibles (soundtrack)}}\n''The Incredibles'' is the first Pixar film to be scored by [[Michael Giacchino]]. Brad Bird was looking for a specific sound as inspired by the film's [[retrofuturistic]] design&nbsp;\u2013 the future as seen from the 1960s. [[John Barry (composer)|John Barry]] was the first choice to do the film's score, with a [[trailer (film)|trailer]] of the film given a rerecording of Barry's theme to ''[[On Her Majesty's Secret Service (soundtrack)|On Her Majesty's Secret Service]]''.

Wallin noted that brass instruments, which are at the forefront of the film's score, sound better on analog equipment rather than digital. Wallin came from an era in which music was recorded, according to Giacchino, \"the right way\", which consists of everyone in the same room, \"playing against each other and feeding off each other's energy\". Many of Giacchino's future soundtracks followed suit with this style of mixing, which has divided [[International Film Music Critics Association|critics]] who feel that the recordings sometimes don't sound natural.
