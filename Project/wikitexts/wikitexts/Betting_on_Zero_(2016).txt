It investigates the allegation that [[Herbalife]] is a [[pyramid scheme]], and follows [[Bill Ackman]]'s [[short (finance)|short]] investment in Herbalife, which is ostensibly a billion-dollar bet that the company will soon collapse.\n\n== Synopsis ==\nThe documentary follows billionaire [[hedge fund]] titan [[Bill Ackman]] and several former Herbalife distributors after Ackman takes a billion dollar short position in [[Herbalife]], alleging it is a pyramid scheme destined to collapse.  The film also chronicles Ackman's feuds with Herbalife CEO [[Michael O. Johnson]] and investor [[Carl Icahn]], and the resulting controversy over both the short and Herbalife's business practices.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-04-14/ackman-herbalife-feud-gets-fresh-scrutiny-at-tribeca-film-fest|title=Ackman-Herbalife Feud Gets Fresh Scrutiny at Tribeca Film Fest|last=Townsend|first=Matthew|work=[[Bloomberg News]]|date=2016-04-14|accessdate=2016-11-08}}</ref>\n\n== Production ==\nIn addition to filming countless hours of [[cin\u00e9ma v\u00e9rit\u00e9]] footage tracking Bill Ackman, anti-Herbalife activist Julie Contreras and others, Director Ted Braun approached Herbalife CEO Michael Johnson, majority investor Carl Icahn, and current Herbalife distributors, but all declined to appear on film or on record.

However, subsequent to the FTC formally charging Herbalife in July, 2016, [[John Fichthorn]], co-founder of Dialectic Capital Management, revealed that he had financed ''Betting on Zero''.  Fichthorn previously held a short position in Herbalife, and when asked on CNBC's ''Fast Money Halftime Report'' if he would consider shorting the stock again he said he \"absolutely\" would. But since early 2014, when ''Betting On Zero'' went into production, he's had no position in Herbalife.<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/halftime/|title=Fast Money Halftime Report|work=[[CNBC]]|date=2016-08-09}}</ref>  An open critic of [[multi-level marketing]] companies, Fichthorn's firm, Dialectic Capital, held short positions in [[Nu Skin Enterprises|Nu Skin]] and [[Primerica]] as of August 2016.<ref name=\"auto\"/>  Bill Ackman, however, had no part in funding the film.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2017/apr/07/stakes-high-as-film-targets-herbalife-2/?f=entertainment|title=Stakes high as film targets Herbalife|date=7 April 2017|publisher=}}</ref> Fichthorn financed ''Betting on Zero'' through Biltmore Films, a company he co-founded along with Burke Koonce to finance and produce business and financial films.\n\n==Controversy==\n\nIt was reported that Podesta and Partners, a lobbying firm run by [[Heather Podesta]] and retained by Herbalife bought 173 tickets to an October 2016 screening of ''Betting On Zero'' at the Washington D.C.
