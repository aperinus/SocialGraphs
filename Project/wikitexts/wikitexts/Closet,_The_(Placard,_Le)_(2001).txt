It is about a man who pretends to be [[homosexuality|homosexual]] to keep his job, with absurd and unexpected consequences.\n\n==Plot==\nFran\u00e7ois Pignon, an unassuming divorced man with a teenage son who ignores him, lives a quiet and unremarkable life. When he learns he will be fired from his job as an [[Accountancy|accountant]] in a [[rubber]] factory, he contemplates [[suicide]], but his new neighbor Jean-Pierre Belone, a former industrial [[psychologist]], dissuades him from jumping from his balcony and suggests a way to keep his position. Belone proposes that Pignon start a rumor he is homosexual by inserting his image in sexually provocative snapshots of a gay couple in a bar and anonymously mailing them to his boss, Mr. Kopel. The factory's primary product is [[condom]]s, so the gay community's support is essential, and Kopel will have to keep Pignon on the payroll to avoid charges of anti-homosexual bigotry.\n\nPignon does not change his usual mild and self-effacing behavior and mannerisms in any way as part of his masquerade. But his supervisors and co-workers begin to regard him in a new light, seeing him as exotic rather than dull, and his life becomes unexpectedly and dramatically better. F\u00e9lix Santini, a homophobic co-worker who used to harass him, is warned he could be fired for discrimination if he continues to belittle Pignon, so he begins to make friendly overtures.\n\nThe company enters a float in a local [[gay pride parade]], and Pignon is coerced into riding on it; his estranged son sees him in the televised broadcast of the parade and tells his mother. The son is thrilled to learn his father, whom he has always considered bland and boring, has a wilder side, and expresses an interest in spending more time with him. His suspicious ex-wife invites Pignon to dinner and demands an explanation. He has by this point gained enough self-confidence to tell her exactly what he thinks of her.\n\nMeanwhile, Santini's charade of friendship has developed into an obsessive attraction; his wife suspects him of having an affair when she finds a receipt for an expensive pink [[Cashmere wool|cashmere]] sweater, and leaves him when he buys Pignon chocolates.  After this, Santini invites Pignon to move in with him. When Pignon turns him down, Santini snaps, a fight ensues, and Santini is institutionalized to recover from his emotional breakdown.\n\nEventually, Pignon's ruse is discovered when Kopel catches him making love in the office to his co-worker, Mlle Bertrand. However, he has become so assertive that he keeps his job, relates to his son, patches up his relationship with Santini, cheers up Belone, and lives [[Happy ending|happily ever after]].\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Daniel Auteuil]] as Fran\u00e7ois Pignon\n* [[G\u00e9rard Depardieu]] as F\u00e9lix Santini\n* [[Thierry Lhermitte]] as Guillaume\n* [[Michel Aumont]] as Jean-Pierre Belone\n* [[Mich\u00e8le Laroque]] as Mademoiselle Bertrand\n* [[Jean Rochefort]] as Kopel\n* [[Laurent Gamelon]] as Alba\n* [[Alexandra Vandernoot]] as Christine\n* [[Mich\u00e8le Garcia]] as Madame Santini\n* [[Edgar Givry]] as Mathieu\n* [[Armelle Deutsch]] as Ariane\n* [[Vincent Moscato]] as Ponce\n* Thierry Ashanti as Victor\n* Stanislas Crevill\u00e9n as Franck\n\n==Production==\nExteriors were filmed in [[Chaville]], [[Clamart]], [[Suresnes]], and central [[Paris]].

The target of its blunt lusty humor is as much exaggerated political correctness and the panic it can engender as it is bigotry.\"<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2001/06/29/arts/29CLOS.html ''New York Times'', June 29, 2001]</ref>\n\n[[Roger Ebert]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' said, \"The movie passes the time pleasantly and has a few good laughs ... But the screenplay relies too much on the first level of its premise and doesn't push into unexpected places. Once we get the setup, we can more or less anticipate the [[situation comedy|sitcom]] payoff, and there aren't the kinds of surprises, reversals and explosions of [[slapstick]] that made ''[[La Cage aux Folles (film)|La Cage Aux Folles]]'' so funny. In the rating system of the [[Michelin Guide]], it's worth a look, but not a detour or a journey.\"<ref>[http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20010706/REVIEWS/107060301/1023 ''Chicago Sun-Times'', July 6, 2001]</ref>\n\n[[Peter Travers]] of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' called the film \"a bonbon spiked with mirth and malice\" and noted, \"Auteuil and Depardieu spar hilariously, and writer-director Francis Veber, following ''[[Le D\u00eener de Cons (film)|The Dinner Game]]'', offers another delicious treat.\"<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20071120020937/http://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/movie/5949337/review/5949338/the_closet ''Rolling Stone'', July 19, 2001]</ref>\n\nLisa Schwarzbaum of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' rated the film A\u2212, calling it a \"cagey, high gloss comedy\" and a \"perfectly built French tickler.\"<ref>[http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,167252,00.html ''Entertainment Weekly'', July 11, 2001]</ref>\n\n===Box office===\nThe film grossed an estimated $25 million in France from more than 5 million admissions.<ref name=open>{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=30 April 2001|page=60|title=Gallic B.O. top 10}}</ref> It was the third highest-grossing film in France during 2001 behind ''[[Am\u00e9lie]]'' and ''[[La V\u00e9rit\u00e9 si je mens !|La V\u00e9rit\u00e9 si je mens ! 2]]''.<ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|page=7|date=24 December 2001|title=Homegrown pix gain in Europe|last=James|first=Alison}}</ref> It grossed $6,678,894 in the US and Canada and $18 million in other foreign markets for a worldwide box office of $50,104,745.<ref>{{mojo title|id=closet.htm}}</ref>\n\n==Awards and nominations==\nDaniel Auteuil was named Best Actor at the [[Shanghai International Film Festival]].\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{Official website|http://www.miramax.com/movie/the-closet}}\n*{{IMDb title|id=0243493|title=The Closet}}\n*{{rotten-tomatoes|closet}}\n\n{{Francis Veber}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Closet, The}}\n[[Category:2001 films]]\n[[Category:2001 comedy films]]\n[[Category:French comedy films]]\n[[Category:2000s French-language films]]\n[[Category:French LGBT-related films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Francis Veber]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Vladimir Cosma]]\n[[Category:Films shot in France]]\n[[Category:2000s French films]]"}]}}}}
