It was released on [[DVD]] on August 22, 2006 which was on the same day that [[Poseidon (film)|Poseidon]] was released on [[DVD]]. The movie served as the [[Television pilot|pilot]] for the television series ''[[Tom and Jerry Tales]]'', which premiered the following month. It was later re-released on [[Blu-ray]] on March 12, 2013.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.blu-ray.com/movies/Tom-and-Jerry-Shiver-Me-Whiskers-Blu-ray/60984/|title=Tom and Jerry: Shiver Me Whiskers Blu-ray|publisher=[[Blu-ray]].com|access-date=April 4, 2020}}</ref>\n\n== Production==\n\nThe film was scripted in 2002, before release of two other films. However, its animation was delayed; it was instead animated from February 2005 to April 2006.\n\n== Plot ==\nThe film starts in the ocean, where an intense thunderstorm is raging. A group of jolly [[Piracy|pirates]] are sailing on their ship, and Red Pirate Ron, who speaks in a language only understood by his [[parrot]], Stan, warns his pirates to lower the sails. Later, [[Tom Cat|Tom]] and [[Jerry Mouse|Jerry]] travel aboard the same pirate ship. It is soon revealed that Ron is searching for the \"Lost Treasure of the Spanish Mane\" and by chance, a wave carries the map to the treasure aboard. Tom hides the map, but is warned by the [[ghost]] of the Spanish Mane's captain, Don Diego de Clippershears, that if the map is not put back into its bottle by sunset, a curse will begin. However, the bottle is swept off the ship, leaving Tom with no way to elude the curse.\n\nAt one point, Tom and Jerry escape from a [[giant squid]] knocking it out with a cannon. The ship is then attacked by Ron's brother, Blue Pirate Bob, who also speaks with the help of '''his''' parrot, Betty (with credit for the attack due to Jerry). Jerry tells them about the map to avoid being eaten by [[Spike and Tyke (characters)|Spike]]. Bob's crew manages to steal the map, but Ron retrieves it and shoots down his brother's ship. Ron's crew celebrates but Jerry stops them by grabbing the treasure bottle from the ship, explaining the reason Tom lost the treasure bottle.\n\nThe sun sets and the ghost appears and begins the curse as a crew of skeleton pirates are called forth. Ron's crew abandons ship, and their lifeboat lands on top of the giant squid that Tom and Jerry fought earlier. Tom and Jerry approach the island and make it a campsite for the night while the Pirates search for the treasure. After being rapidly chased by Spike, Tom finds the ghost, who angrily abandons him for not telling him about the curse. Jerry finds the treasure chest just as the Pirates find the same way and they argue over the treasure map, causing it to fly into the sea and sink into the squid's hungry mouth. With no way to stop the curse, Tom hopelessly leaves back to the pirate ship only to discover that it bumped into a jagged rock and got stuck near the sand.\n\nWhen Tom arrives, he meets Purple Pirate Paul, Ron and Bob's brother who tells him the way to stop the curse. Leading him to a tomb, he explains that it is a shelter to stop the curse and to retrieve the treasure bottle. Jerry arrives and takes refudge that night while the Pirates grieve over the loss of the treasure map. The very next morning, Tom realizes that the giant squid having spat out the treasure map, has broken the curse.\n\nTom and Jerry rush back to the pirate ship and rally the Pirates to find the treasure chest. and retrieve a stone egg, which is the key to unlocking the tomb's entrance, though Tom ends their partnership due to Jerry using him as live bait. Because the entrance's lock resembles a frying pan, the duo solve the puzzle by cracking open the egg and placing it on the stone pan. After maneuvering through many traps and tests (including crushing pillars and a memory game), they reach the cave that contains the treasure. Don Diego urges Jerry to take it, but this makes Jerry suspicious, as he knows that it seems too easy. His suspicions are proven correct when he sees that he must deal with the treasure's guardian first. Tom rushes inside and is shocked to see the same giant squid from earlier standing guard. When it recognizes Tom, it shrieks in fear and a [[stalactite]] crushes it. Tom and Jerry retrieve some of the treasure. When they exit the tomb, Ron, Paul and Bob (after dismissing their parrots) begin to fight over the treasure. Jerry seizes this opportunity to sneak it away and onto Bob's ship, which has been fully repaired. Tom follows Jerry by catapulting himself onto the ship.\n\nIn the pirate ship, Jerry, Tom, and Spike take full control of it with Jerry being made to be the captain, Spike being made to pilot the ship, and Tom being made to swab the deck (with Spike ensuring that he doesn't slack) while Stan, Betty, and Chuck join the trio. While Tom, Jerry, and Spike's new pirate ship sets sail and leaves Ron, Bob, Paul and their crews behind and stranded on the island, the group run from the stone chicken, which somehow reassembled itself.\n\n== Voice cast ==\n* [[William Hanna]] as [[Tom Cat]] and [[Jerry Mouse]] (archive recordings, uncredited)\n* [[Kevin Michael Richardson]] as Red Pirate Ron, Blue Pirate Bob and Purple Parrot Chuck \n* [[Kathy Najimy]] as Blue Parrot Betty\n* [[Charles Nelson Reilly]] as Red Parrot Stan\n* [[Wallace Shawn]] as Purple Pirate \"Barnacle\" Paul and the Narrator\n* [[Mark Hamill]] as spirit of Don Diego de Clippershears as skull\n* [[Dan Castellaneta]] as Spike Bulldog and Additional Voices\n\n== Widescreen ==\n''Tom and Jerry: Shiver Me Whiskers'' was the third ''Tom and Jerry'' film to be filmed in widescreen and the third one to be filmed in the [[High-definition video|high-definition]] format (the first being ''[[Tom and Jerry: Blast Off to Mars]]'' and ''[[Tom and Jerry: The Fast and the Furry]]''), although the Region 1 DVD and the U.S. version of [[Boomerang (TV network)|Boomerang]] were in [[Full screen (cinema)|full screen]] (cropping the left and right of the image) though not [[pan and scan]] as the camera stays directly in the center of the image. Like other television shows and films filmed in high-definition, the monitor the animation team would have worked from would have 16:9 and 4:3 safe areas so that the full screen version would not crop off too much of any important visual elements (such as characters). However, the film is broadcast in widescreen on [[Cartoon Network]] in the United States and released in widescreen on the Region A Blu-ray.\n\n== Reception ==\nDavid Cornelious of [[DVD Talk]] gave a positive review saying \"has enough chuckles in it that it comes recommended to families and fans alike.\"<ref>{{Cite web|last=Cornelious|first=David|date=August 22, 2006|title=Tom and Jerry - Shiver Me Whiskers|url=https://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/23448/tom-and-jerry-shiver-me-whiskers/|access-date=June 10, 2020|website=DVD Talk}}</ref>\n\n== Follow-up film ==\n''[[Tom and Jerry: A Nutcracker Tale]]'' was released on October 2, 2007.\n\n== External links ==\n* {{IMDb title|0808508}}\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n{{Tom and Jerry}}\n{{H-B films}}\n{{Warner Bros. animation and comics}}\n\n[[Category:2006 films]]\n[[Category:Tom and Jerry films]]\n[[Category:2006 animated films]]\n[[Category:2006 direct-to-video films]]\n[[Category:2000s American animated films]]\n[[Category:2006 action comedy films]]\n[[Category:2000s historical films]]\n[[Category:2000s children's animated films]]\n[[Category:American children's animated action films]]\n[[Category:American children's animated adventure films]]\n[[Category:American children's animated comedy films]]\n[[Category:American children's animated fantasy films]]\n[[Category:American fantasy adventure films]]\n[[Category:American action adventure films]]\n[[Category:American adventure comedy films]]\n[[Category:Films set on ships]]\n[[Category:Slapstick films]]\n[[Category:Pirate films]]\n[[Category:Treasure hunt films]]\n[[Category:American swashbuckler films]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Mark Watters]]\n[[Category:Warner Bros.
