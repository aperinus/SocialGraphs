Directed by [[Kevin Yagher]] and [[Joe Chappelle]], the film stars [[Doug Bradley]] as [[Pinhead (Hellraiser)|Pinhead]], reprising his role and now the only remaining original character and cast member. It also features [[Bruce Ramsay]], [[Valentina Vargas]], [[Kim Myers]] and [[Adam Scott (actor)|Adam Scott]] in his first major film role. It was the last ''Hellraiser'' film to be released theatrically, the last to have any major official involvement with series creator [[Clive Barker]] until [[Hellraiser (2022 film)|2022 reboot]] and the final installment in the original series chronologically.\n\nIn the 18th century, a celebrated toymaker (Ramsay) is hired to create his greatest work, the Lament Configuration<!--Any link redirects to the original novella.-->, not knowing that it will allow the summoning of the demonic [[Cenobite (Hellraiser)|Cenobites]], including Pinhead (Bradley) and Angelique (Vargas). Hundreds of years in the future, the toymaker's descendant (also played by Ramsay), an engineer, has designed a space station that he believes can trap and destroy the Cenobites. Major themes include time, toys and game-playing, adultery and slavery.\n\nThe film had a troubled history and, after completing the film, original director Yagher left the production when distributor [[Miramax]] demanded new scenes be shot. It was subsequently completed by Chappelle. The new scenes and re-shoots changed several characters' relationships, gave the film a happy ending, introduced Pinhead earlier, and cut 25 minutes. Yagher felt the changes diverged too strongly from his vision and was granted the [[Alan Smithee]] pseudonym, an alias used by directors who want to go uncredited. Miramax released it in the United States on March 8, where it grossed $9 million. It was not screened for critics and received negative reviews.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 2127, Dr. Paul Merchant, an engineer, seals himself in a room aboard The Minos, a [[space station]] that he designed. As armed guards attempt to break through the door, Merchant manipulates a robot into solving the [[Lemarchand's box|Lament Configuration]], destroying the robot in the process. The guards break through the door and apprehend Merchant, who agrees to explain his motivations to their leader, Rimmer.\n\nThe film flashes back to Paris, France, 1796. Dr. Merchant's ancestor, Phillip LeMarchand, a French toymaker, makes the Lament Configuration on commission from the [[libertine]] aristocrat Duc de L'Isle. Unbeknownst to LeMarchand, L'Isle's specifications for the box make it a portal to [[Hell]]. Upon delivering the box to L'Isle, LeMarchand watches as he and his assistant Jacques sacrifice a peasant girl and use her flayed-off skin to summon a demon, Angelique, through the box. LeMarchand runs home in terror, where he begins working on blueprints for a second box which will neutralize the effects of the first. Returning to L'Isle's mansion to steal the box, LeMarchand discovers that Jacques has killed L'Isle and taken control over Angelique, who agrees to be his slave so long as he does not impede the wishes of Hell. The pair kill LeMarchand, and Jacques informs him that his bloodline is now cursed for helping to open a portal to Hell.\n\nIn 1996, LeMarchand's descendant, John Merchant, has built a skyscraper in Manhattan that resembles the Lament Configuration. Seeing an article on the building in a magazine, Angelique asks Jacques to take her to the United States so that she can confront him. When Jacques denies her request, Angelique kills him, as Merchant poses a threat to Hell. Angelique travels to the United States, where she fails to seduce Merchant. Discovering the Lament Configuration in the building's foundation, Angelique tricks a security guard into solving it, which summons [[Pinhead (Hellraiser)|Pinhead]]. The two immediately clash, as Pinhead represents a shift in the ideologies of Hell, which she left behind two hundred years ago: while Angelique believes in corrupting people through temptation, Pinhead is fanatically devoted to pain and suffering. Despite their conflicting views, the pair forge an uneasy alliance to kill Merchant before he can complete the Elysium Configuration, an anti-Lament Configuration that creates perpetual light and would serve to permanently close all gateways to Hell.\n\nAngelique and Pinhead initially collaborate to corrupt Merchant, but Pinhead grows tired of Angelique's seductive techniques and threatens to kill Merchant's wife and child. Having grown accustomed to a decadent life on Earth, Angelique wants no part of Hell's new fanatical austerity, and she intends to force Merchant to activate the Elysium Configuration and destroy Hell, thus freeing her from its imperatives. However, Merchant's flawed prototype fails. Pinhead kills Merchant, but his wife opens Angelique's Lament Configuration, sending Pinhead and Angelique back to Hell.\n\nIn 2127, Rimmer disbelieves Dr. Merchant's story and has him locked away. Pinhead and his followers - now including an enslaved Angelique - have already been freed after Merchant opened the box. Upon learning of Dr. Merchant's intentions, they kill the entire crew of the ship, save for Rimmer and Dr. Merchant, who escape. Dr. Merchant reveals that the Minos is, in fact, the final, perfected form of the Elysium Configuration, and that by activating it, he can kill Pinhead and permanently seal the gateway to Hell.\n\nDr. Merchant distracts Pinhead with a hologram while he boards an escape pod with Rimmer. Once clear of the station, he activates the Elysium Configuration. A series of powerful lasers and mirrors create a field of perpetual light, while the station transforms and folds around the light to create a massive box. The light is trapped within the box, killing Pinhead and his followers, thus ending Pinhead's existence, this time, permanently.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Doug Bradley]] as [[Pinhead (Hellraiser)|Pinhead]]. In the shooting script, Pinhead had a violently antagonistic relationship with Angelique. This was softened during editing and [[Pick-up (filmmaking)|pick-ups]], and a hinted sexual attraction between them was introduced.{{sfn|Kane|2013|p=141}}\n* [[Bruce Ramsay]] as Philippe \"Toymaker\" Lemarchand / John Merchant / Doctor Paul Merchant. Ramsay called Philippe an ambitious but good man who is seduced by Angelique's power. He described John as more self-aware and mature; Paul, he said, is weathered.{{sfn|Kane|2013|p=137\u2013138}}\n* [[Valentina Vargas]] as Angelique / Peasant Girl. Vargas said she was reluctant to take the role because of nightmares about Pinhead, but she soon became interested in exploring her character's seductive and evil nature.{{sfn|Kane|2013|p=138}} Originally a demon summoned through black magic who commissions the Lament Configuration, her origin was changed to be dependent on the box.{{sfn|Kane|2013|p=133, 149}}\n* [[Kim Myers]] as Bobbi Merchant. Bobbi was written to mirror Larry from the first film, both of whom suspect their spouses of infidelity.{{sfn|Kane|2013|p=138}}\n* [[Adam Scott (actor)|Adam Scott]] as Jacques, de L'Isle's assistant. Jacques initially had a smaller role, but he was rewritten and expanded upon when Angelique's origin changed.{{sfn|Kane|2013|p=151}}\n* [[Christine Harnos]] as Rimmer. Originally male, Rimmer was rewritten in a later draft after several female characters were streamlined out, including a descendant of Kirsty Cotton who would serve as Paul's love interest.{{sfn|Kane|2013|p=135}}\n* [[Charlotte Chatton]] as Genevieve Lemarchand. In the script, Genevieve is also depicted as more suspicious of her husband, whom she suspects to be having an affair. This was mostly removed during editing.{{sfn|Kane|2013|p=149}}\n* Mickey Cottrell as Duc de L'Isle. In the script, de L'Isle had a larger part, but some of his scenes were given to Jacques when Angelique's origin changed.{{sfn|Kane|2013|p=151}} He is modeled after the [[Marquis de Sade]] and [[Gilles de Rais]].{{sfn|Kane|2013|p=154}}\n* Jody St. Michael as [[Chatterer|Chatterer Beast]], a Cenobite. The script describes it as pieced together from the remains of a dog and a man after a car accident.{{sfn|Kane|2013|p=135}} St. Michael played the Chatter Beast as an animal.{{sfn|Kane|2013|p=147}}\n* [[Courtland Mead]] as Jack Merchant\n* [[Polish brothers|Mark and Michael Polish]] as Siamese Twins{{sfn|Kane|2013|p=139}}\n\n==Production==\n=== Pre-production ===\nClive Barker, acting as executive producer, wanted a fresh turn for the series after two sequels to his original 1987 film. The initial premise for the film, a shape-changing structure used to trap Pinhead, was inspired by the ending of ''Hellraiser III'', which featured a building whose architecture resembled the Lament Configuration. Barker suggested a three-part film set in different time periods, and Peter Atkins added the Lemarchand storyline, going back to Barker's novella. Atkins had previously written ''Hellraiser II'' and co-written ''Hellraiser III''. Atkins and Barker pitched the idea to Miramax, who greenlit it without requiring an outline.{{sfn|Kane|2013|p=132}}\n\nIn ''The Hellraiser Films and Their Legacy'', author [[Paul Kane (writer)|Paul Kane]] described the screenplay as ambitious and \"one of the best of the ''Hellraiser'' sequels\".{{sfn|Kane|2013|p=136}} This screenplay featured a linear timeline, more special effects, and violent confrontations between Pinhead and Angelique. When Miramax was unwilling to provide a budget to realize these scenes, the film was scaled back. [[Stuart Gordon]], known for his low-budget horror films, was approached to direct but backed out after artistic disagreements. Special effects technician [[Kevin Yagher]] was subsequently hired after his cost-saving directing work on ''[[Tales from the Crypt (TV series)|Tales from the Crypt]]'' for [[Joel Silver]]. Yagher was initially hesitant about taking the job, as he did not want to do a retread of the previous installments of the series. However, he was impressed with the script and became enthusiastic after Barker described his vision for the film.{{sfn|Kane|2013|p=136\u2013137}}\n\nDoug Bradley, who had played Pinhead in all the previous films, joined the cast first. Bradley agreed the film should focus more on the other characters, and several lesser-known actors joined in major roles, including Canadian Bruce Ramsay and Chilean Valentina Vargas. As the script was scaled back once again to save money, the number of characters was reduced, and several were rewritten to have simpler motivations and origins. [[Gary J. Tunnicliffe]] of Image Animation, who had previously worked on ''Hellraiser III'', was recruited to perform special effects. Tunnicliffe was worried that Yagher would want to perform the effects himself, but Yagher wanted to collaborate with Image Animation and believed their experience with prior films in the series would be valuable. Yagher himself only contributed to the Chatter Beast. For Angelique's appearance, Tunnicliffe was inspired by [[Morticia Addams]] and ''[[Sister Act]]'', converting the imagery of a [[Religious habit|nun's habit]] to flayed skin. In ''Hellraiser III'', Bradley's make-up as Pinhead had changed to make it easier to apply and take off at the cost of increased discomfort. Tunnicliffe reverted to the old make-up, which he believed looked better.{{sfn|Kane|2013|p=138\u2013139}}\n\n=== Filming and post-production ===\nFilming began in Los Angeles in August 1994. Locations included the I. Magnin Building, which was rumored to be haunted, and an abandoned factory, which was converted into the space station. Problems began early and continued throughout production. Bradley called it \"the shoot from hell\".{{sfn|Kane|2013|p=141}} [[Gerry Lively]], who had shot ''Hellraiser III'', replaced the original cinematographer, the assistant director was called away on an emergency, several people suffered from illnesses, and Bradley said the art department and camera crew were all dismissed within the first week. Despite the issues, ''Hellraiser IV'' was completed on time and within its budget. The initial cut of the film, shown to studio executives in early 1995, was 110 minutes.{{sfn|Kane|2013|p=140\u2013141}}\n\nMiramax's reaction was negative, however, and they demanded that Pinhead receive a more prominent role and appear earlier. Atkins said they knew about the script but possibly panicked when they saw the reality. Miramax's demands required rewrites; Pinhead was inserted into the opening of the film, which was changed so that the 22nd century Paul Merchant narrates his ancestors' story, and a happy ending was added. Yagher, coming off the difficult shoot, declined to direct the new scenes and left the production, citing a lack of time and energy. Though he was not necessarily opposed to Miramax's suggested changes, Yagher said he also did not want to see the film slowly morph into a different product after spending so much effort on it.{{sfn|Kane|2013|p=140\u2013141}}\n\nDirector [[Joe Chappelle]] was brought in to complete the film.{{sfn|Kane|2013|p=141-142}} Atkins wrote three new scenes, and, when he became unavailable, Barker recommended [[Rand Ravich]], who had previously worked on ''[[Candyman: Farewell to the Flesh]]''. New footage was shot in April and May 1995. Bradley said they consisted of entirely new material and were not truly re-shoots. Angelique's origin and relationships with Pinhead and the Lemarchand line were changed. Many scenes were removed during editing, especially from the Lemarchand storyline. Angelique and Pinhead originally had a more violent and adversarial relationship; Angelique represented an older, more chaotic version of Hell that favors drawn-out temptation, and Pinhead represented an ascetic, results-based order that takes over. The theatrical cut makes this more ambiguous and replaces some of their hostility with sexual tension. The final cut was 85 minutes long. When Yagher saw the finished film, he felt it strayed too far from his original vision and had his name removed from the credits, using the [[Directors Guild of America|DGA]] pseudonym [[Alan Smithee]].{{sfn|Kane|2013|p=142}}\n\n==Themes==\n{{Undue weight section|date=December 2016}}\nKane identifies several themes in the film. The first, time, is evident in the film's non-linear narrative, which takes place in the past, present, and future. Kane compares the flashbacks told from the future with time travel stories. Though Paul does not travel through time, he succeeds in his task, Kane writes, because of his knowledge of the past, including his ancestors' plans and their failings. The characters frequently reference time in dialog, and clocks are a common background element, especially in Phillip's toy shop. In the space station, a countdown announces the time until the Elysium Configuration will kill Pinhead and his fellow Cenobites. Before he dies, Pinhead announces, \"I am forever!\"{{sfn|Kane|2013|p=144\u2013145}}\n\nToys and game-playing are a common theme in the film series, all of which feature the Lament Configuration, a mystical puzzle box created by a toymaker. Kane identifies these themes as \"much more blatant\" in ''Bloodline''. In the original shooting script, demonic gamblers served Angelique. She plays sexual games with her victims, and Pinhead toys with mortals for amusement. Kane draws parallels to video games when John uses a computer to design the Elysium Configuration, and Kane compares the space station scenes to a [[shoot 'em up]] game in which Paul insists only he can win the endgame. Pinhead makes many references to game-playing, including when he kills John, and John's wife, Bobbi, references game-playing when she sends Pinhead back to Hell.{{sfn|Kane|2013|p=145\u2013148}}\n\nKane identifies sex, death, and adultery as frequently intertwined, though he says this is somewhat weakened in the theatrical cut. Angelique tempts the Lemarchand bloodline, and adultery results in their death. Due to cuts made during editing, Kane says this is most evident in Angelique's relationship with John; in the shooting script, Phillip's obsession with Angelique and the Lament Configuration more explicitly mirrored that of a marital affair. Kane writes that Paul avoids death by ignoring relationships and is rewarded with a relationship once he redeems his bloodline. Jacques orders Angelique to kill Phillip out of jealousy, and it is this same jealousy that later causes his death at Angelique's hands.{{sfn|Kane|2013|p=148\u2013150}}\n\nAccording to Kane, many of the characters' relationships are based on slavery and bondage. Angelique is a slave to de L'Isle, then Jacques. When she rebels against the new austerity in Hell, she comes into conflict with Pinhead, who eventually puts her under his control. Pinhead himself is a slave to the will of Hell, though Kane says he exercises more independence than Angelique. The Lemarchand bloodline are slaves to the Lament Configuration; John, and, to a lesser extent, Phillip are also slaves to their obsession with Angelique. Mirror images feature prominently in the film, including the twin cenobite and literal mirrors that Angelique and Paul use. In Kane's analysis, Paul not only mirrors his ancestors but also Pinhead, whom he emulates to become stronger. Kane describes how darkness and light also show up in the film, sometimes literally, as when light kills Pinhead, and sometimes metaphorically, as when Angelique and Pinhead show elements of their underlying humanity.{{sfn|Kane|2013|p=151\u2013154}}\n\n==Soundtrack==\nThe score was composed by [[Daniel Licht]] and was released on March 19, 1996.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/hellraiser-4-bloodline-original-soundtrack-mw0000183921|title=Hellraiser 4: Bloodline (Original Soundtrack) - Daniel Licht|work=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=2016-07-03}}</ref> Kane wrote of it: \"The whole score is powerful, blending unconventional instrumentation occasionally augmented by a chorus\".{{sfn|Kane|2013|p=143}} Kane highlighted the chase sequence music in the Chatter Beast's scenes.{{sfn|Kane|2013|p=143}}\n\n==Release==\n''Bloodline'' was not screened for critics.<ref name=lat/> It was released on March 8, 1996, in the United States and Canada, where it grossed $4.5 million in its opening weekend and came in fifth place.

Atkins said he was uninterested in exploring more ''Hellraiser'' stories, as he could not see anywhere for the series to go creatively, but he recognized Miramax had a financial interest in keeping the series alive. Bradley said he was open to reprising his role, but Barker's reaction was more negative.{{sfn|Kane|2013|p=158}} \n\n===Home media===\n''[[Hellraiser: Inferno]]'' followed in October 2000, going direct-to-video.{{sfn|Kane|2013|p=166}} Dimension released ''Bloodline'' on VHS and DVD in 1996<ref name=ew/> and 2001,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dvdverdict.com/reviews/hellraiserbloodline.php|title=Hellraiser: Bloodline|last=Naugle|first=Patrick|work=[[DVD Verdict]]|date=2001-06-29|access-date=2016-05-25|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160404123252/http://www.dvdverdict.com/reviews/hellraiserbloodline.php|archive-date=2016-04-04}}</ref> and [[Echo Bridge Home Entertainment]] released it on Blu-ray for the first time in 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/movies/hellraiser-bloodline/blu-ray-104401|title=Hellraiser: Bloodline|work=[[IGN]]|access-date=2016-05-25}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.blu-ray.com/movies/Hellraiser-Bloodline-Blu-ray/22170/ | title=Hellraiser: Bloodline Blu-ray (Hellraiser IV)}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n''Bloodline'' received negative reviews on release.
