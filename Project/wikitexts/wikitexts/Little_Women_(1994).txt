The screenplay by [[Robin Swicord]] is based on [[Louisa May Alcott]]'s [[Little Women|1868-69 two-volume novel of the same title]], the fifth [[feature film]] adaptation of the classic story. After a limited release on December 25, 1994, the film was released nationwide four days later by [[Columbia Pictures]].\n\nThe film received three [[Academy Award]] nominations for [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]] (Ryder), [[Academy Award for Best Costume Design|Best Costume Design]], and [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Best Original Score]]. It was followed by a loose sequel, ''[[Little Men (1998 film)|Little Men]]'', without Ryder's involvement.\n\n==Plot==\nThe March sisters: responsible Meg, [[Wiktionary:tempestuous|tempestuous]] Jo, tender Beth, and romantic Amy, are growing up in [[Concord, MA]] during and after the [[American Civil War]]. Their father is fighting in the war and, with their strong-willed mother, Marmee (pronounced \"Mahmee\") they struggle with major and minor problems in 19th century New England. The girls revel in performing Jo's romantic [[play (theatre)|plays]] in their attic theater.\n\nNext door neighbor, wealthy Mr. Laurence's grandson Theodore (\"Laurie\") moves in, becoming a close friend of the Marches, particularly Jo. Mr. Laurence mentors Beth, whose exquisite piano-playing reminds him of his deceased daughter, and Meg falls in love with Laurie's tutor John Brooke.\n\nWhen Mr. March is wounded, Jo sells her hair so Marmee can go by train to nurse him back to health. While she is away, Beth continues visiting a struggling immigrant family, providing food and firewood. She contracts [[scarlet fever]] from them. Awaiting Marmee's return, Meg and Jo, who both previously survived scarlet fever, send Amy away to live safely with their Aunt March. Amy laments to Laurie that she may die without ever being kissed. He promises to kiss her before she dies if she becomes ill.\n\nPrior to Beth's illness, Jo had been Aunt March's companion for several years, and although she didn't enjoy it, she hoped she would take her to [[Europe]]. Beth gets worse, so Marmee returns home, nursing her to recovery in time for Christmas, but the illness has severely weakened her. Mr. Laurence gives his daughter's piano to Beth, Meg accepts John Brooke's proposal and Mr. March surprises them, returning home from the war.\n\nFour years pass; Meg (now 20) and John marry, and Beth's health is worsening. Graduating from college, Laurie proposes to Jo (now 19) and asks her to go to [[London]] with him but, seeing him more as a brother than a lover, she refuses. Jo is disappointed when Aunt March decides to take 17-year-old Amy with her to Europe instead of her. She has been Aunt March's companion and wishes to further her artistic training in Europe. Crushed, Jo departs for [[New York City]] to pursue writing and experience life. There she meets Friedrich Bhaer, a [[Germany|German]] [[professor]] who challenges and stimulates her intellectually, introducing her to [[opera]] and [[philosophy]], and encouraging her to write better stories than the lurid [[Victorian era|Victorian]] [[melodrama]]s she has penned so far.\n\nIn Europe, Amy is reunited with Laurie. Disappointed to find he has become dissolute and irresponsible; she scolds him for pursuing her merely to become part of the March family. In return, he bitterly rebukes her for courting one of his wealthy college friends to marry into money. He asks Amy to wait for him in a letter while he works in London for his grandfather and makes himself worthy.\n\nJo is called home for eighteen-year-old Beth, who finally dies of the after-effects of [[scarlet fever]] (presumably [[rheumatic heart disease]]) that plagued her for the past four years. A saddened Jo retreats to the comfort of the attic, writing her [[narrative|life story]]. Upon completion, she sends it to Professor Bhaer. Meanwhile, Meg has [[Twins#Dizygotic (fraternal) twins|fraternal twins]] Demi and Daisy.\n\nA letter from Amy tells them Aunt March is too ill to travel, so Amy must remain in Europe with her. In London, Laurie receives a letter from Jo about Beth's death, saying Amy is in [[Vevey]], unable to come home. He immediately goes to be at Amy's side. They finally return to the March home as spouses, to Jo's surprise and eventual delight.\n\nAunt March dies, leaving Jo her house. She turns it into a school. Professor Bhaer arrives with the printed galley proofs of her [[manuscript]] but, believing Jo is married, he departs to catch a train to the West, to accept a professorship. Jo runs after him, explaining the misunderstanding. She begs him not to go, he proposes, and she happily accepts.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Winona Ryder]] as Josephine \"Jo\" March, an ambitious young woman, who longs to become a successful author.\n* [[Gabriel Byrne]] as Friedrich Bhaer, an older professor who falls in love with Jo while he works as a tutor in New York and eventually marries her.\n* [[Trini Alvarado]] as Margaret \"Meg\" March, the oldest March sister. She marries Laurie's tutor, John Brooke, and gives birth to fraternal twins: a boy, John (nicknamed \"Demijohn\" by Jo, which is shortened to \"Demi\"); and a girl, Margaret, called \"Daisy\" at home \"so as to not have two Megs\".\n* [[Kirsten Dunst]] and [[Samantha Mathis]] as Amy March, the youngest March child and quick-witted daughter. Instead of the brown hair and brown or green eyes of her three older sisters, she has golden curls and blue eyes. She later marries Laurie and becomes a successful painter. Amy was the only character played by two different actresses - Dunst portrayed her at twelve years old in the first half of the movie, Mathis as a seventeen-year-old in the second half of the movie.\n* [[Claire Danes]] as Elizabeth \"Beth\" March, the third March daughter and the pianist of the family. She is shy, good, sweet, kindly, and loyal. At the young age of fourteen, she contracted scarlet fever, which weakened her heart and resulted in her death four years later at the age of eighteen.\n* [[Christian Bale]] as Theodore \"Laurie\" Laurence, the young neighbor who becomes Jo's best friend in their youth. Later, he tries, but fails, to convince her to marry him. He eventually falls in love with and marries Amy.\n* [[Eric Stoltz]] as John Brooke, Laurie's tutor and Meg's eventual husband.\n* [[John Neville (actor)|John Neville]] as Mr. James Laurence, Laurie's grandfather and a kind neighbor of the Marches.\n* [[Mary Wickes]] as Aunt Josephine March, the only March family member who still has a lot of money. Upon her death, her estate is left to adult Jo, who transforms it into a school for boys.\n* [[Susan Sarandon]] as Abigail \"Marmee\" March, the mother of the March daughters and the loving wife of Mr. March.\n* [[Matthew Walker (Canadian actor)|Matthew Walker]] as Robert March, the father of the four March daughters, Marmee's loving husband, and long-time devoted spouse.\n* [[Florence Paterson]] as Hannah Mullet, the loyal housekeeper of the March family since Meg was born. The girls think of her more as a good friend than a servant.\n* [[Janne Mortil]] as Sally Moffat, Meg's one and only good friend, who is quite rich and prosperous.\n* [[Donal Logue]] as Jacob Mayer\n\n==Development==\nIt took ''Little Women'' 12 years to find a studio. According to writer Robin Swicord and producer Denise Di Novi \"people just weren't interested in a movie with a lot of women...\". One executive suggested a modern version. \"...the Marches are in the 90s and not happy about not having a car for Christmas\". In the industry films like ''Little Women'' were referred to as \"needle in the eye\" pictures. They were assumed to have no appeal to male audiences and deemed not worth the risk of production. Eventually, Columbia agreed to consider the project under the condition that Winona Ryder was to play Jo.<ref name=\"Spencer NYT\">{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/12/movies/little-women.html|title=Little Women - Movie|access-date=29 November 2020|date=12 September 2019|last=Spencer|first=Ashley|work=The New York Times}}</ref>\n\nOriginally, Gillian Armstrong wasn't on board with directing ''Little Women''. She rejected the offer several times due to the similarities between ''Little Women'' and her previous film, [[My Brilliant Career (film)|''My Brilliant Career'']]. However, with persuasion from Denise DiNovi and Amy Pascal (the producers), Armstrong came to realize that the two films were different after all.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Murray |first1=Scott |title=Passionate Women |url=https://issuu.com/libuow/docs/cinemapaper1995marno103_60c4dc78a238cc |website=Issuu |publisher=Cinema Papers |access-date=21 November 2020}}</ref> With the help of screenwriter, Robin Swicord, they aimed to portray more mature themes than the previous adaptations\u2014 such as, family, growing up, and progressive feminism.<ref>Francke, Lizzie. \"WHAT ARE YOU GIRLS GOING TO DO?\" Sight and Sound Apr 01 1995: 28. ProQuest. Web. 21 Nov. 2020 .</ref> When co-writing, Armstrong chose not to look back at the previous films for inspiration but instead decided to stay true to the novel.\n\n===Casting===\nAlong with Winona Ryder, already signed on to play Jo, offers for the roles of Marmee and Laurie were sent out to Susan Sarandon and Christian Bale. Sarandon almost turned down the role because \"... it was towards the end of the school year, and I had a pretty strict policy about not leaving my young kids\". \n\nThe part of Amy was the most difficult casting decision to be made. This adaptation was the first and only to have two different actresses play Amy over the course of the film. According to producer Denise Di Novi, there was something \"weird\" about having one actress playing first a child and then an adult: \"It just didn't work.\" \n\nAmong those to read for the role of Amy were the then-unknown [[Natalie Portman]], and [[Thora Birch]] who had already filmed ''[[Hocus Pocus (1993 film)|Hocus Pocus]]'' and ''[[Patriot Games (film)|Patriot Games]]''. In the end, Kirsten Dunst was chosen - Armstrong mentioned in a 2019 interview that \"Kirsten Dunst really blew [other young Amy candidates] out of the water\". The decision for the role of the older Amy was close between [[Reese Witherspoon]] and Samantha Mathis. Armstrong's first pick, if the production had decided on casting one actress to play Amy, was Witherspoon, \"... the very best person we auditioned was Witherspoon. She was also short...\". However, casting director Carrie Frazier finally decided to settle on Mathis.\n\nThe initial candidate to play Bhaer, for di Novi, was [[Hugh Grant]]. \"We all had a huge crush on Hugh\". However, Frazier was not on board the idea, claiming that the option was a bit \"off the rails\". Grant was too young and confident to play the Bhaer of the book that Frazier, Di Novi, and Armstrong wanted. [[John Turturro]] also lobbied persistently for the role, but Frazier wanted a deeper and more poetic Bhaer, and decided on Gabriel Byrne.<ref name=\"Spencer NYT\" />\n\n=== Filming ===\nThe 1994 adaptation of ''Little Women'' was filmed primarily in parts of Canada, such as Vancouver Island and Vancouver, both in the province of British Columbia. However, certain scenes were shot in the United States, throughout Massachusetts.<ref>{{cite web |title=Little Women (1994) Locations |url=https://www.latlong.net/location/little-women-1994-locations-263#:~:text=Filming%20locations%20were%20British%20Columbia%2C%20Canada%2C%20and%20Deerfield%2C%20Massachusetts. |website=LatLong |access-date=21 November 2020}}</ref> Gillian Armstrong was adamant about creating a look that remained faithful to ''Little Women's'' time period.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Murray|first1=Scott|title=Passionate Women|url=https://issuu.com/libuow/docs/cinemapaper1995marno103_60c4dc78a238cc|access-date=21 November 2020|website=Issuu|publisher=Cinema Papers}}</ref> The overall film aesthetic for the 1994 ''Little Women'', was heavily influenced by photographs, paintings, and drawings from the era. Armstrong and cinematographer Geoffrey Simpson sought inspiration from artwork that was created during the Civil War Era, when Little Women was written. In collaboration with the rest of the crew including art director Jan Roelfs, they used these works of art as guidelines for the sets, costumes, colour coordination, and even camera lighting.\n\nThe film is dedicated to murder victim [[Murder of Polly Klaas|Polly Klaas]] and literary agent Judy Scott-Fox.<ref name=\"McCarthy\">{{Cite web |date = December 14, 1994 |author=Todd McCarthy |title = Little Women |url=https://variety.com/1994/film/reviews/little-women-3-1200439688/ |work=Variety }}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n===Critical reception===\nOn [[Rotten Tomatoes]], 93% of 42 reviews were positive, with an average rating of 7.3/10.
