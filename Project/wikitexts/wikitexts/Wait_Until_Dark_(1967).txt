When she disembarks, Lisa becomes worried upon seeing a man watching her at the airport and gives the doll to a fellow passenger, professional photographer Sam Hendrix ([[Efrem Zimbalist Jr.]]), for safekeeping. She is roughly escorted away by the other man.\n\nA few days later, con artists Mike Talman ([[Richard Crenna]]) and Carlino ([[Jack Weston]]) arrive at the apartment of Sam and his blind wife, Susy ([[Audrey Hepburn]]), believing it to be Lisa's residence. Harry Roat ([[Alan Arkin]]), the man who met Lisa at the airport, arrives to persuade Talman and Carlino to help him find the doll. After the con men discover Lisa's body, Roat [[blackmail]]s them into helping him dispose of it and convinces them to help him find the doll. While Sam is on a photography assignment, the criminals begin an elaborate [[Confidence trick|con game]], using Susy's blindness against her and posing as different people to win her trust. Implying that Lisa has been murdered and that Sam will be suspected, the men persuade Susy to help them find the doll. Mike gives her the number for the phone booth across the street as his own after falsely warning her of a police car outside.\n\nGloria (Julie Herrod), a girl who lives upstairs and who had borrowed the doll earlier, sneaks in to return it. She reveals to Susy that there is no police car outside. After calling Mike and realizing it is the phone booth's number, Susy realizes that the three are criminals and hides the doll. She tells them that the doll is at Sam's studio and the three leave after Roat cuts the telephone cord. Carlino stays behind to stand guard outside the building. Susy sends Gloria to the bus station to wait for Sam. When she discovers that the telephone cord has been cut, she prepares to defend herself by breaking all the lightbulbs in the apartment except for that of the [[safelight]]. When Mike returns, he realizes that she knows the truth and demands the doll, but she refuses to cooperate. Mike admits to Susy that he and his confederates are part of a criminal plot, while Roat is the particular danger. He assures her that he has sent Carlino to kill Roat. However, having anticipated their plan, Roat has killed Carlino instead, and he then kills Mike on the doorstep of Susy's apartment.\n\nIntent on acquiring the doll, Roat threatens to set the apartment on fire. Susy finally agrees to give him the doll but throws a chemical at Roat's face and unplugs the safelight as the apartment is plunged into darkness. Roat uses matches to see, but Susy douses him with gasoline, forcing him to put out the match. Roat finally produces light by opening the refrigerator. Susy, realizing that she has lost the battle, pulls the doll out from its hiding place and hands it to him. While Roat is distracted with it, Susy is able to arm herself with a kitchen knife. Roat then tries to walk Susy to the bedroom, but she stabs him and flees. She is unable to escape the chained front door and stumbles toward the kitchen window to scream for help, but Roat leaps from the darkness and grabs her ankle. She wrenches free and conceals herself behind the refrigerator door. Just as he stands to stab her, she unplugs the refrigerator, leading to total darkness yet again. The police arrive with Sam and Gloria. Susy is found, unharmed, behind the refrigerator door, while the dead Roat rests nearby, disabled by a toppled shelf.\n\n== Cast ==\n===(credited cast)===\n* [[Audrey Hepburn]] as Susy Hendrix\n* [[Alan Arkin]] as Roat / Harry Roat Jr. /  Harry Roat Sr.\n* [[Richard Crenna]] as Mike Talman\n* [[Efrem Zimbalist Jr.]] as Sam Hendrix\n* [[Jack Weston]] as Carlino\n* Samantha Jones as Lisa\n* Julie Herrod as Gloria\n\n===(uncredited cast)===\n* [[Jean Del Val]] as The Old Man\n* Frank O'Brien as Shatner\n* [[Gary Morgan (actor)|Gary Morgan]] as Teenage Boy on Street\n* Bill Walters as BG with Dog\n* [[Mel Ferrer]] as French-Canadian Radio Speaker\n\n==Music==\n===Soundtrack===\n{{More citations needed section|date=August 2016}}\n{{Tracklist\n| collapsed = yes\n| headline  = ''2007 Film Score Monthly Album''<ref>{{cite magazine | url = http://www.filmscoremonthly.com/cds/detail.cfm/CDID/383/Wait-Until-Dark/ | title = ''Wait Until Dark'' | magazine = [[Film Score Monthly]] | access-date = October 20, 2012 }}</ref>\n| title1    = Come On Louie/The Doll \n| length1   = 1:49\n| title2    = Main Title \n| length2   = 4:11\n| title3    = Don't Make Waves/Big Drag for Lisa  \n| length3   = 3:26\n| title4    = Light Relief \n| length4   = 1:09\n| title5    = Radio Source/He's Got Time \n| length5   = 3:04\n| title6    = World's Champion Blind Lady \n| length6   = 1:24\n| title7    = Phono Source I \n| length7   = 3:02\n| title8    = Phono Source II \n| length8   = 1:43\n| title9    = Pick Up Sticks \n| length9   = 2:24\n| title10   = The Doll Again \n| length10  = 3:19\n| title11   = Watch the Booth/It's for You \n| length11  = 1:25\n| title12   = Chair Kicker \n| length12  = 4:42\n| title13   = Bulbus Terror \n| length13  = 3:53\n| title14   = Gassy!/Strum Along/The Doll \n| length14  = 3:37\n| title15   = Cutting Roat a New One \n| length15  = 1:50\n| title16   = You're Doing Fine \n| length16  = 1:15\n| title17   = Wait Until Dark \n| length17  = 2:15\n| title18   = Bonus Track: Alternate Main Title \n| length18  = 2:06\n| title19   = Bonus Track: He's Got Time (alternate) \n| length19  = 0:39\n| title20   = Bonus Track: Piano Tests \n| length20  = 2:30\n}}\n\n==Exhibition==\n{{unreferenced section|date=April 2018}}\nTo immerse viewers in the suspense of the climactic scene, movie theater owners dimmed their lights to the legal limits, and then turned them off, one by one until the audiences were in complete darkness.\n\n==Reception==\nThe film was one of the more popular of its year, earning North American rentals of $7,350,000.<ref>\"Big Rental Films of 1968\", ''Variety'', 8 January 1969 p 15.
