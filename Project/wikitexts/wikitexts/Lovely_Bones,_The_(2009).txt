It is based on [[Alice Sebold]]'s [[The Lovely Bones|2002 novel of the same name]] and stars [[Saoirse Ronan]], [[Mark Wahlberg]], [[Rachel Weisz]], [[Susan Sarandon]], [[Stanley Tucci]] and [[Michael Imperioli]].

One day, Ray, a boy she has a crush on, asks her out. As Susie walks home through a cornfield, she runs into her neighbor, George Harvey, who coaxes her into an underground \"kid's hideout\" he has built. Inside, Susie grows uncomfortable and attempts to leave; Harvey grabs her and the scene fades until she is seen rushing past her alarmed classmate Ruth Connors, seemingly fleeing Harvey's den.\n\nThe Salmons become worried when Susie fails to return home from school. Her father, Jack, searches for her, while her mother, Abigail waits for the police. In town, Susie sees Jack, who does not respond to her when she calls. Susie runs home to find Harvey soaking in a bathtub. After seeing the bloody bathroom and her bracelet hanging on the sink faucet, Susie realizes she never escaped the underground hideout because Harvey murdered her. Screaming, she is pulled into the \"[[Limbo|In-Between]]\", which is neither Heaven nor Earth. From there, Susie watches over her loved ones, and resists her new afterlife friend Holly's urging her to let go.\n\nInvestigating Susie's disappearance with Detective Fenerman, Jack believes Susie was murdered by someone she knew. He researches neighbors and eventually suspects Harvey is the killer. Fenerman is unable to find proof, as Harvey has carefully concealed the evidence. Susie's sister, Lindsey, agrees with Jack's suspicions, but their casework takes a toll on Abigail. Abigail's alcoholic mother, Lynn, moves into the house. Feeling alienated from her husband, Abigail goes to California. Susie, in her afterlife, learns that Harvey, who has targeted Lindsey as his next victim, has [[Serial killer|murdered six other girls]], including Holly, and that he stuffed Susie's body into a large safe in his basement.\n\nOne night, Jack, carrying a baseball bat, trails Harvey into the cornfield. However, Jack accidentally stumbles across a teen couple named Clarissa and Brian. Brian, thinking they will be assaulted, bludgeons Jack nearly to death as Harvey watches nearby while Clarissa begs him to stop. As Jack recuperates, Lindsey breaks into Harvey's house looking for evidence that he killed Susie. Upstairs, she finds a notebook containing a sketch of the underground den, a lock of Susie's hair, and news articles about Susie's disappearance. Harvey returns and almost catches Lindsey, but she escapes and rushes home to discover that her mother has returned. She gives the notebook to her grandmother, who contacts the police. Harvey has already fled his home &ndash; taking the safe containing Susie's body with him.\n\nSusie's afterlife begins expanding into a larger heaven, and she is greeted by Harvey's other victims. She resists Holly's urging her to enter Heaven along with the others, claiming she has one final thing to do. Meanwhile, Susie's classmates Ruth and Ray are present when Harvey drives up to dispose of the safe at a sinkhole dump site on the Conners' property. Susie returns to Earth and [[Spirit possession|enters Ruth's body]], causing Ruth to faint. Ray rushes to Ruth's aid only to realize she has become Susie. They kiss, completing Susie's last wish, and she returns to Heaven. Meanwhile, Harvey dumps the safe in the sinkhole, leaving it to disappear in the muddy water as he drives away.\n\nSometime later, Harvey meets a young woman outside a diner and offers her a ride, but she rejects him and leaves. A large icicle falls from an overhead branch, hitting Harvey's shoulder, causing him to fall backward over a steep cliff to his death. Time passes, and Susie sees that her family is healing, which Susie refers to as \"the lovely bones\" that grew around her absence. Susie finally enters Heaven, telling the audience: \"My name is Salmon, like the fish; first name Susie. I was 14 years old when I was murdered on December 6, 1973. I was here for a moment and then I was gone. I wish you all a long and happy life.\"\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Saoirse Ronan]] as Susie Salmon, the main character and narrator.<ref name=\"weisz\"/> She is a 14-year-old girl, who is killed by her neighbor.

He was also critical of the film's portrayal of Heaven, which he compared to \"a happy gathering of new [[Facebook]] friends\". However, he praised the acting, stating that \"this whole film is Jackson's fault\".<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/the-lovely-bones-2010 |date=2010-01-13 |title=The Lovely Bones |work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]] |access-date=2010-01-14}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the [[British Board of Film Classification]] (BBFC), the rating given to ''The Lovely Bones'' received 24 objections, more than any other movie in 2010. The BBFC report states, \"Many found the film to be a shocking and upsetting experience. The scene in which young Susie is entrapped by the killer, and the subsequent sequence in which the killer soaks in a bath after the murder, were compared by some complainants to scenes in '18' rated horror films.\" The BBFC rated the movie a 12A, and many complained that the movie was upsetting for a younger audience. Nevertheless, the BBFC defended its rating: \"The Lovely Bones lacked any explicit detail of the murder and any sexual elements were downplayed. The audience's sympathies remain entirely with the family and the film had many positive messages about life.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://uk.movies.yahoo.com/14062011/35/most-complained-film-2010-0.html |title=The most complained about film of 2010 |website=Yahoo!
