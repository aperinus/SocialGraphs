To keep him out of it, Hiro's older brother Tadashi takes him to his research lab at the San Fransokyo Institute of Technology. Hiro meets Tadashi's friends Go Go, Wasabi, Honey Lemon, and Fred, as well as his creation Baymax \u2014 an [[Soft robotics|inflatable]] healthcare robot \u2014 and his mentor, Professor Robert Callaghan. Inspired, Hiro applies to the university and impresses the school's [[talent show|showcase]] with his project: a swarm of tiny [[microbots]] that can link together in any configuration using a [[brain-computer interface|neural transmitter]]. Callaghan accepts him into the school, and Hiro rejects tech giant Alistair Krei's offer to buy the microbots. When a fire erupts, Tadashi rushes inside to save Callaghan, but dies due to the building collapsing after an explosion resulting from the fire.\n\nTwo weeks later, Hiro inadvertently activates Baymax and they follow his only remaining microbot to an abandoned warehouse, where they discover someone has been mass-producing the microbots. A man wearing a [[Kabuki]] mask attacks them with the microbot swarm, but they escape, and Hiro suspects the masked man set the fire to cover his theft of the microbots. Determined to avenge his brother's death, Hiro equips Baymax with armor and a chip programmed with martial arts moves, and they return to find the warehouse empty. At the nearby docks, Baymax summons Tadashi's friends, and the group is attacked by the masked man but escapes after driving into a lake. At Fred's mansion, Hiro upgrades Baymax's armor and he and the others weaponize their various inventions to take on the masked man, whom they suspect is Krei.\n\nThey track the masked man to Krei's abandoned island lab, which they discover was used for [[teleportation]] research until a test pilot disappeared inside a portal, leading the government to shut down Krei's experiment and seal off the island.  The masked man suddenly attacks the group, but Hiro knocks off the man's mask, revealing him to be Callaghan, who was [[Faked death|thought to be dead]]. Callaghan reveals that he had actually escaped using the microbots to shield himself from the flames. Shocked and enraged that Tadashi died in vain, Hiro removes Baymax's healthcare chip and orders him to kill Callaghan, but his friends intervene and Honey re-installs the chip at the last second. Callaghan escapes with the microbots, and Hiro, angered by his friends\u2019 actions against Callaghan, flies off with Baymax, still intent on avenging Tadashi.\n\nWhen they return home, Hiro tries to remove the healthcare chip again, but Baymax blocks his access port and shows him footage of Tadashi's numerous tests during Baymax's development, reminding Hiro that his brother's goal was to help others. Hiro apologizes to Baymax and his friends; through research, they discover the lost test pilot was Callaghan's daughter, Abigail.\n\nHaving stolen the microbots to seek revenge on Krei, Callaghan reactivates the teleportation portal to destroy Krei and his headquarters during a ceremony, but Hiro, Baymax, and their friends defeat Callaghan and save Krei. Baymax detects Abigail alive inside the portal, and despite Krei\u2019s attempts to keep them away from the portal because of its instability, Hiro and Baymax leap through and find Abigail trapped in hyper-sleep in her rocket. While helping Hiro transport Abigail out of the portal, Baymax is struck by debris, disabling his thrusters and forcing him to fire his rocket fist, leaving him behind while propelling Hiro and Abigail back through the portal before it is destroyed. Abigail regains consciousness, and Callaghan is arrested.\n\nHiro joins his friends at the university, and discovers Baymax's healthcare chip clenched in the rocket fist. He rebuilds Baymax, and they and their friends continue to protect the city as a team of high-tech superheroes, known as Big Hero 6.\n\nIn a [[post-credits scene]], Fred stumbles upon a secret superhero lair in his family mansion and is reunited with his father, who tells him they have a lot to talk about.\n\n==Voice cast==\n{{Further|List of Disney's Big Hero 6 characters}}\n*[[Scott Adsit]] as [[Baymax (Disney)|Baymax]], an inflatable robot built by Tadashi as a medical assistant.

One is a soft plastic 10-inch version that includes a series of projected stills from the film on his stomach, which can be changed when the figure's arm is moved, and which emits accompanying sounds. Deluxe Flying Baymax, which retails for $39.99, depicts the armored version of the character and features lights and sounds that activate at the push of a button. Placing the Hiro figurine on his back changes the sounds into speech and when the figure is tilted, the sounds are those of flying. The Armor-Up Baymax (original retail cost $19.99) comes with 20 pieces of armor that can be assembled onto the robot by the owner. The other characters from the film, including the other members of team and Professor Callaghan (who is called Yokai) are issued in 4-inch action figures, each of which have eight points of articulation.<ref name=\"auto\">Robertson, Andy (July 16, 2014).
