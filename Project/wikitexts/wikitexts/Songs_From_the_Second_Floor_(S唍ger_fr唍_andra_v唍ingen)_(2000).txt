It presents a series of disconnected vignettes that together interrogate aspects of modern life. It uses quotations from the work of Peruvian poet [[C\u00e9sar Vallejo]] as a recurring motif.\n\nIt is the first film in a trilogy, followed by ''[[You, the Living]]'' (2007) and ''[[A Pigeon Sat on a Branch Reflecting on Existence]]'' (2014).\n\n==Plot==\nA man is standing in a subway car, his face dirty with soot. In his right hand he carries a plastic bag with documents, or rather, the charred leftovers of them. In a corridor a man is clinging desperately to the legs of the boss who just fired him. He is screaming: \"I've been here for thirty years!\" In a coffee shop someone is waiting for his father, who just burned his furniture company for insurance money. Traffic jams and self-flagellating stock brokers are filling up the streets while an economist, desperate for a solution to the problem of work becoming too expensive, gazes into the crystal ball of a [[scryer]]. The main men all have goals but their destinations change during the story.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Lars Nordh]] as Kalle\n* Stefan Larsson as Stefan\n* [[Bengt C. W.

Hoberman]] from ''[[The Village Voice]]'' concluded about the film: \"Easier to respect than enthuse over, Andersson's rigorous personal vision is not only distanced but distancing.\"<ref>Hoberman, J. (2002-06-02) \"[https://www.villagevoice.com/2002/07/02/suspended-animation/ Suspended Animation]\"</ref> [[Roger Ebert]] of ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' gave the film four stars out of four and wrote, \"You may not enjoy it but you will not forget it.\"<ref>rogerebert.com, \"[http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/songs-from-the-second-floor-2002 Songs from the Second Floor]\".
