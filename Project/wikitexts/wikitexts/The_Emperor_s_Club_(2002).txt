Based on [[Ethan Canin]]'s 1994 short story \"The Palace Thief\", the film follows a [[University-preparatory school|prep school]] teacher and his students at a fictional boys' prep school, St. Benedict's Academy, near [[Washington, D.C.]]\n\n==Plot==\nWilliam Hundert works at a boarding school for boys called Saint Benedict's in the 1970s, where he is a passionate classics teacher who attempts to impart wisdom and a sense of honor to his students; he begins the school year by having new student Martin Blythe read a plaque that hangs over his door which contains a statement made by an ancient Mesopotamian ruler, [[Shutruk-Nakhunte|Shutruk Nahunte]]. The plaque sings Shutruk Nahunte's praises, but Hundert explains that he contributed nothing of value to his kingdom, and as a result is virtually forgotten today.\n\nHundert's disciplined life and classroom are shaken when a new student, Sedgewick Bell, is enrolled late in the class. Sedgewick possesses none of Hundert's principles and is the son of a [[U.S. senator]]. He frequently disrupts class and does poorly in his homework. Hundert meets with Sedgewick's father to talk about his behavior, only to discover that the senator totally lacks interest in Sedgewick, beyond knowing he is passing his classes.\n\nHundert decides to help Sedgewick, they develop a friendship, and Sedgewick's grades improve. The traditional end-of-the-year \"Mr. [[Julius Caesar]] contest\", in which the top three students compete in a classics quiz in front of the entire school, is approaching. Sedgewick, very hard to earn a spot, but ends up in fourth place. Hundert doesn't want his efforts to be for naught, so he raises his grade to qualify; Hundert later observes Martin, the rightful third place contestant, Martin Blythe, despondently withdrawn under a tree. During the competition Hundert spies Sedgewick using [[crib notes]], but the [[headmaster]] orders Hundert to ignore it. Hundert then deliberately asks Sedgewick a question on [[Hamilcar Barca]] which was not covered in class; it is answered correctly by another contestant, Deepak Mehta (having been seen earlier by Hundert reading a book on [[military science]] on his own initiative), who is crowned \"Mr. Julius Caesar\". The cheating is never publicized, but the trust Sedgewick and Hundert had in each other is broken. Sedgewick returns to his old ways and barely graduates, with Hundert expressing deep disappointment that he failed Sedgewick.\n\nTwenty-five years later, Hundert is poised to become the new headmaster, but resigns in shock when a less experienced teacher gets the position due to his fundraising ability. Hundert is later told that Sedgewick will make a tremendous donation to Saint Benedict's, contingent upon Hundert hosting a Mr. Julius Caesar rematch at Sedgewick's resort hotel on the [[Gold Coast, Long Island]]. The new members of Sedgewick's graduating class are also invited, and all enjoy the reunion. The three original contestants begin the competition, but as it progresses, Hundert realizes that Sedgewick is being fed answers by an assistant through an earpiece. Hundert asks a question about Shutruk Nahunte, which all the students find laughably easy; however, Sedgewick is unable to answer it. Deepak answers correctly and once again wins. Afterward, Sedgewick formally announces that he is running for a seat in the U.S. Senate. While the men applaud, Hundert is appalled that he was used for political grandstanding.\n\nShortly after the announcement, Hundert and Sedgewick run into each other in the men's room, where Hundert confronts Sedgewick. Sedgewick tells Hundert that the real world is full of dishonesty, and that Hundert has let life pass him by. The tirade is overheard by one of Sedgewick's young sons, who is shocked to learn the truth about his father. That evening, at the hotel bar, Hundert apologizes to Martin and admits that he gave his spot to Sedgewick in the competition years ago. Martin forgives him, but his body language makes his feelings toward Hundert ambiguous. The following morning, the resort is apparently empty; however, Hundert is then greeted by a [[surprise party]], held in his honor by his former students, who present an award engraved with a quote about education. The guys wave goodbye as the helicopter carrying Hundert departs, and he reflects that while he failed with Sedgewick, he succeeded with others.\n\nHundert returns to his old job teaching classics in the present-day Saint Benedict's, which is now coeducational and more diverse. A boy then enters the class: the son of Martin Blythe, whose name is also Martin Blythe (IV). Hundert peers outside the window to see Blythe gladly waving to his old teacher. Hundert has the younger Blythe read the plaque above the door.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Kevin Kline]] as William Hundert\n* [[Emile Hirsch]] as Sedgewick Bell\n** [[Joel Gretsch]] as adult Sedgewick\n* [[Embeth Davidtz]] as Elizabeth\n* [[Rob Morrow]] as James Ellerby\n* [[Edward Herrmann]] as Headmaster Woodbridge\n* [[Harris Yulin]] as Senator Hiram Bell\n* [[Paul Dano]] as Martin Blythe\n** [[Steven Culp]] as adult Martin\n* [[Jesse Eisenberg]] as Louis Masoudi\n** [[Patrick Dempsey]] as adult Louis\n* Rishi Mehta as Deepak Mehta\n** [[Rahul Khanna]] as adult Deepak\n* [[Caitlin O'Heaney]] as Mrs. Woodbridge\n* Gabriel Millman as Robert Brewster\n* Tim Realbuto as Jackson Pheiffer\n* Chris Morales as Eugene Field\n* Luca Bigini as Copeland Gray\n* Michael Coppola as Russell Hall\n* Sean Fredricks as Mr. Harris\n* Katherine O'Sullivan as The Nun\n* Jimmy Walsh as Robert Bell\n* Nick Hagelin as Martin Blythe IV\n}}\n\n==Reception==\nThe film was nominated at the [[24th Young Artist Awards]] in 2003 for Best Family Feature Film \u2013 Drama, and [[Emile Hirsch]] for Best Performance in a Feature Film \u2013 Supporting Young Actor.\n\nThe film received mixed reviews from critics. {{As of|2020|07}}, the film holds a 50% approval rating on review aggregator [[Rotten Tomatoes]], based on 127 reviews with an average rating on 5.78/10.
