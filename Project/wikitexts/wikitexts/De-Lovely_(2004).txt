The screenplay by [[Jay Cocks]] is based on the life and career of [[Cole Porter]], from his first meeting with his wife, [[Linda Lee Thomas]], until his death. It is the second biopic about the composer, following 1946's ''[[Night and Day (1946 film)|Night and Day]]''.\n\n==Plot==\nAs he is about to die, Porter's life flashes before him in the form of a [[musical theatre|musical production]] staged by the [[archangel]] [[Gabriel]] in the [[Indiana]] theater where the composer first performed on stage.\n\nHe recalls the night he met his wife, [[Linda Lee Thomas]], a recent divorcee and stunning beauty. From the start, they click and become a devoted couple. Linda is well aware that Cole is gay. Her first husband was abusive to her, but, as she confesses to him on their wedding day, Cole is completely different. Because he loves her and is publicly affectionate, Linda tolerates his extramarital dalliances. During their marriage, Cole's career flourishes. Linda begins the tradition of presenting Cole with a custom designed and engraved Cartier cigarette case at the opening of each new show.\n\nTo cheer Linda after she experiences a miscarriage, the couple move to Hollywood. After an initial period of excitement, Cole's flings become too overt and indiscreet and they create tension. Cole is photographed in an amorous embrace with another man in the [[Public toilet|restroom]] of a gay [[nightclub]]. Both he and Linda are blackmailed into paying a large sum to suppress publication of the pictures. When he shrugs off the [[blackmail]], she goes to [[Paris]], leaving him bereft.\n\nIt is not until Cole is seriously injured in a horseback riding accident that Linda returns to his side, willing to forgive, but still finding difficulty in coping with his extramarital affairs. She is eventually diagnosed with [[emphysema]], and in an attempt to provide Cole with a new partner once she is gone, she introduces him to her decorator and estate advisor. The match is successful.\n\nWhen Linda dies in 1954, Cole is devastated. He continues working until 1958 when degeneration of his right leg finally requires amputation, affecting his creative output. He never writes again, but does participate in productions of his earlier works. Cole dies in 1964 at age 73.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/movies/news/2004-06-29-porter-side-linda_x.htm | work=USA Today | title=The woman beside the man | first1=Elysa | last1=Gardner | date=2004-06-30 | access-date=2010-05-01}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/movies/news/2004-06-29-delovely-main_x.htm | work=USA Today | title='De-Lovely' examines unsanitized Porter | first1=Elysa | last1=Gardner | date=2004-06-30 | access-date=2010-05-01}}</ref>\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Kevin Kline]] as [[Cole Porter]]\n* [[Ashley Judd]] as [[Linda Lee Thomas|Linda Lee Thomas/Porter]]\n* [[Jonathan Pryce]] as [[Gabriel|Gabriel the archangel]]\n* [[Kevin McNally]] as [[Gerald and Sara Murphy|Gerald Murphy]]\n* [[Sandra Nelson]] as [[Gerald and Sara Murphy|Sara Murphy]]\n* [[Allan Corduner]] as [[Monty Woolley]]\n* [[Peter Polycarpou]] as [[Louis B.

He stayed in character by limiting his vocal range. Most of his singing was recorded live on the set, and the actor played the piano himself in the scenes where Porter plays.\n\nAccording to Winkler's commentary on the DVD release of the film, he had considered numerous actresses for the role of Linda when [[Ashley Judd]]'s agent advised him she was interested in the part. Winkler was certain her salary demand would exceed that allowed by the budget, but the actress was so anxious to portray Linda she was willing to lower her usual asking price. Judd is twenty years younger than Kline, although the composer's wife was eight years older than he.\n\nFilming locations included [[Chiswick House]] and [[Luton Hoo]].\n\nThe film premiered at the [[2004 Cannes Film Festival]].<ref name=\"festival-cannes.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/4183985/year/2004.html |title=Festival de Cannes: De-Lovely |access-date=2009-12-05 |work=festival-cannes.com |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120805005539/http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/4183985/year/2004.html |archive-date=2012-08-05 }}</ref> It was shown at the CineVegas International Film Festival, the [[Sydney Film Festival]], and the [[San Francisco International Lesbian and Gay Film Festival]] before going into limited release in the US.\n\n==Reception==\nThe film grossed $13,337,299 in the US and $5,059,083 in other markets for a total worldwide box office of $18,396,382.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.the-numbers.com/movies/2004/DLOVE.php|title=De-Lovely (2004) \u2013 Financial Information|website=the-numbers.com|access-date=16 August 2017}}</ref>\n\nCritically, the film had a mixed reception.

In their highly stylized ways, ''[[All That Jazz (film)|All That Jazz]]'' ([[Bob Fosse]]'s morbidly manic screen [[autobiography]]), [[Ken Russell]]'s surreal portraits of composers or any of [[Federico Fellini]]'s libidinous self-explorations have delved deeply into the muck of artistic creativity.

Director Irwin Winkler's highly stylized technique is difficult to connect with emotionally. His film also suffers from shockingly sloppy editing for a studio production. If nothing else, the composer . . . deserves a movie that has rhythm. But ''De- Lovely'' lurches along like a car with a missing spark plug.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2004/07/02/DDG347ESHP1.DTL|title='De-Lovely' dances with two left feet|website=sfgate.com|date=2 July 2004|access-date=16 August 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', [[Peter Travers]] rated the film three out of a possible four stars and commented, \"In voice, manner, patrician charm and private torment, Kevin Kline is perfection as legendary composer Cole Porter . . .

You can't make a good movie about a 1930s composer using a 1970s film conceit while hiring 21st century recording artists to perform Porter's classic songs. A tribute CD, maybe, but not a movie . . . [it] plays like a cabaret review rather than a motion picture, a sublime collection of songs linked by scripted banter barely scratching the surface of its subject. Not delightful, not delicious, just disappointing.\"<ref>[http://www.sptimes.com/2004/07/15/Weekend/_De_Lovely__isn_t_pre.shtml ''St. Petersburg Times'' review]</ref>\n\n''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' reported that the film \"has inspired a Cole Porter renaissance on Top Jazz albums\". By the end of July 2004, the film's soundtrack reached 4\u20133 on Top Soundtracks and 77\u201358 on The Billboard 200.
