The film explores the issues and difficulties in the world of professional dance, and how each individual copes with the stresses. This movie was [[Zoe Salda\u00f1a|Zoe Saldana]]'s and [[Amanda Schull]]'s film debut.\n\nThe single from the film's soundtrack \"[[I Wanna Be with You (Mandy Moore song)|I Wanna Be with You]]\" is performed by [[Mandy Moore]]. The song became Moore's highest charting song in the US at number 24, becoming her only top 40 song in the nation. It spent 16 weeks on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], and peaked during its 9th week on the chart.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite web |url=https://www.billboard.com/music/mandy-moore/chart-history |title=Mandy Moore Chart History &#124; Billboard |website=www.billboard.com |access-date=17 January 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190513180147/https://www.billboard.com/music/mandy-moore/chart-history |archive-date=13 May 2019 |url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nAfter a series of countrywide auditions, twelve young [[dance]]rs gain entry to the American Ballet Academy (which is loosely based on the [[School of American Ballet]]), the affiliate school of the American Ballet Company (which appears to be based on either the [[American Ballet Theatre]] or the [[New York City Ballet]]). They work hard, attending classes every day for weeks to make them the best dancers they can possibly be, and in preparations for a final dance workshop which will determine the three boys and three girls who will be asked to join the company. The workshop will also provide an opportunity for the students to showcase their talent to other ballet companies across the country. Gaining a leading part in the workshop is therefore essential.\n\nTensions mount between Jonathan Reeves ([[Peter Gallagher]]), the company's aging [[choreography|choreographer]] and director, and Cooper Nielson ([[Ethan Stiefel]]), his [[solo (dance)|best dancer]], who also wants to choreograph. They also have issues because Kathleen Donahue ([[Julie Kent (dancer)|Julie Kent]]), Cooper's ex-girlfriend and fellow dancer, left him to wed Jonathan. Star student Maureen ([[Susan May Pratt]]), a closet bulimic who seems poised for success, discovers that life is passing her by when she meets a pre-med student ([[Eion Bailey]]) who shows her the merits of a life without ballet, to the dismay of her controlling stage mother ([[Debra Monk]]), herself a failed ballet dancer and current ABC employee. Sweet Jody Sawyer ([[Amanda Schull]]), despite underdeveloped turn out, body type issues, and poor footwork, is determined to dance professionally, but it appears less and less likely as the movie progresses that she will be good enough. Jody's parents, Jonathan, Maureen, and ballet teacher Juliette Simone ([[Donna Murphy]]) try to convince Jody to move on from dance and attend college. Jody refuses to give up on her dream of being in a professional ballet company. Talented, but smart aleck Eva Rodriguez ([[Zoe Salda\u00f1a|Zoe Saldana]]; doubled by SAB alumna and former NYCB member [[Aesha Ash]]) from Boston loves to dance but seems destined to be stuck in the back of the [[corps de ballet|corps]] because of her bad attitude. Tensions also arise between Charlie ([[Sascha Radetsky]]), a naturally gifted fellow advanced student from Seattle, and Cooper over Jody; Charlie has a crush on Jody, who had a one-night stand with Cooper and remains infatuated with him.\n\nDespite Jonathan's objections, Cooper choreographs a rock/pop music-based ballet for the workshop. Three ballets are presented; Jonathan and another choreographer create the other two respectively\u2014the two more \"traditional\" ballets are not danced to actual ballet music, however. The first (not shown, beyond entrances of the corps and soloist from the wings) is to [[Felix Mendelssohn|Mendelssohn]]'s ''[[Italian Symphony]]'', while Jonathan's ballet (choreographed by [[Christopher Wheeldon]]) is set to [[Rachmaninov]]'s 2nd Piano Concerto. Cooper's ballet (choreographed by [[Susan Stroman]]) mirrors the relationship between himself, Jonathan, and Kathleen. Jody, Charlie, and their gay friend Erik ([[Shakiem Evans]]) are set to dance the three lead roles when Erik sprains his ankle in a final rehearsal. To Jonathan's protests and Jody's apprehension, Cooper steps in to fill the role, and the tensions between Jody, Charlie, and Cooper play out on the stage.\n\nAfter the final workshop, Cooper starts his own dance company, much to Jonathan's chagrin, as Cooper's financial backer is a wealthy widow (played by [[Elizabeth Hubbard]]) who Jonathan was hoping would donate to American Ballet Company. Cooper asks Jody to be a [[principal dancer]], as her dancing style, though technically deficient, is perfect for his company. He also asks to date her, but Jody turns him down in favor of Charlie. Maureen decides to give up ballet because she finally realizes that ballet is just something she does well and not what she wants in life. She decides to attend regular [[university]] and also seek help for her eating disorder. Eva is picked by Jonathan to join ABC after proving her worth in the workshop, surprising everyone by dancing in place of Maureen as the lead in Jonathan's ballet. When Nancy confronts Maureen for quitting, she calls her mother out for her behavior. She points out that ballet was Nancy's passion and that she only did ballet to make Nancy proud because she never got the chance to be a ballet dancer herself. After realizing how unhappy she is, Maureen decided she wants a normal life in attending college and follow her own dreams away from Nancy. Charlie, and fellow advanced students and friends Anna (who was always favored by Jonathan and who danced \"[[Gelsey Kirkland]]'s part\" as the lead in the ''Italian Symphony'' ballet; played by SAB alumna and former NYCB corps member Megan Pepin) and Erik are also asked to join the American Ballet Company, and Sergei ([[Ilia Kulik]]), Charlie and Erik's roommate and friend, joins his girlfriend Galina in the San Francisco Ballet Company.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast list|\n* [[Amanda Schull]] as Jody Sawyer\n* [[Zoe Salda\u00f1a|Zoe Saldana]] as Eva Rodr\u00edguez\n* [[Susan May Pratt]] as Maureen Cummings\n* [[Peter Gallagher]] as Jonathan Reeves\n* [[Debra Monk]] as Nancy Cummings\n* [[Ethan Stiefel]] as Cooper Nielson\n* [[Sascha Radetsky]] as Charles \"Charlie\" Sims\n* [[Donna Murphy]] as Juliette Simone\n* [[Julie Kent (dancer)|Julie Kent]] as Kathleen Donahue\n* [[Ilia Kulik]] as Sergei\n* [[Eion Bailey]] as James \"Jim\" Gordon\n* [[Shakiem Evans]] as Erik \"O.

Scott wrote for the film:\n{{blockquote|The script, by Carol Heikkinen, has a lot of business to take care of before the Big Show, which is its mandatory climax, and it steamrolls through its expository scenes with more efficiency than grace, as though in a desperate hurry to reach the next commercial break.

As do unfortunate lines like, 'I'm not dancing for them anymore; I'm dancing for me.' The only solace from such schlock is the fact that the film makes it clear from the start that it exists simply to showcase the dancing itself. As such, it's no shock when the choreography upstages the screenwriting. Ultimately the story line here is as stupid as the final \"rock\" ballet. The characters are one-dimensional, as are their \"struggles.\" In fact, the territory is so familiar that it's almost excusable. With that said it's still hard to watch Center Stage and be able to get the familiar opening music to Fame out of your head; it's also hard to remember why you're not simply watching that film instead.<ref>[http://www.contactmusic.com/new/film.nsf/reviews/centerstage \"Center Stage Movie Review\"].
