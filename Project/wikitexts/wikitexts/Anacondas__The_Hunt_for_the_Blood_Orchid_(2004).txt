It is a [[stand-alone sequel]] to the film ''[[Anaconda (film)|Anaconda]]'' (1997) and the second installment of the [[Anaconda (film series)|''Anaconda'' film series]]. The film follows a team of researchers set for an expedition into the Southeast Asian tropical island of [[Borneo]], to search for a sacred flower for which they believe will bring humans to a longer and healthier life, but soon become stalked and hunted by the deadly giant anacondas inhabiting the island.\n\nIt was released on August 27, 2004, and the last film in the series to be released theatrically. Like its predecessor, the film received negative reviews, but was a financial success. The film was followed by a sequel, ''[[Anaconda 3: Offspring]]'' in 2008.\n\n== Plot ==\n<!-- Per [[WP:FILMPLOT]], film plots must be between 400 and 700 words.  Please do not expand the plot beyond 700 words. It is currently 637 words. -->\nA team of researchers funded by New York pharmaceutical firm Wexel Hall, including Dr. Jack Byron, Gordon Mitchell, Sam Rogers, Gail Stern, Cole Burris, and Dr. Ben Douglas, leave for a jungle in [[Borneo]] to search for a flower called ''Perrinnia immortalis''--\"''the Blood Orchid''\"\u2014that they believe contains a [[fountain of youth]]. Jack convinces guide Captain Bill Johnson and his partner Tran Wu to take an unsafe path despite their misgivings. Their boat goes over a waterfall and breaks apart. A giant anaconda emerges from the water and swallows Ben whole. The rest of the team reach shore. Bill assures them that it was the largest snake he has ever seen and that it should take weeks for it to grow hungry again. However, most of the team demand that the expedition be called off. They call for Bill's friend, John Livingston, who lives on the river, to join them, only to find Livingston attacked and his boat wrecked.\n\nThey find a small native village and a disembowelled anaconda, a pair of human legs hanging out of the snake's abdomen, and an orchid remain. Evidently, the orchids are a part of the food chain, and these snakes grow over unusually long lives. Jack realizes the orchids must be nearby, while Gail contends that the orchids may not work on humans. Jack tries to bully Sam, but she rebels and the group starts building an escape raft.\n\nGordon discovers that Jack has hid Livingston's radio and gun. Jack fails to convince him to continue with the expedition, so he paralyzes Gordon using a previously collected spider. Jack joins the others at the raft, but a suspicious Sam discovers Gordon and the spider bite. An anaconda swallows Gordon alive as she informs the others, who arrive as it finishes. Bill sets the building on fire but notices the snake has escaped. Jack, left alone, steals the raft.\n\nUnable to make another raft, they hack through the jungle to beat Jack to the orchids and retrieve their raft. On the way they fall into a cave trying to escape from an anaconda. Cole gets lost and finds human skeletons. He is found by Tran, who then gets pulled under and eaten. Bill, looking for the two, finds Tran's lost flashlight floating in bloody water. A terrified Cole escapes from the cave, seconds ahead of the snake, which gets stuck in the hole. Sam beheads it with a machete, but another snake captures the hysterical Cole. The team follows to find him being constricted. Bill throws his knife and impales the snake through the head, freeing Cole.\n\nThe group finds Jack and his raft. Jack shoots Bill in the arm and forces the party to accompany him to the orchids, which grow above a pit in which a ball of male anacondas are mating with the female. Sam is forced to cross the pit via a thin log to fill a backpack with orchids. As she returns, the log cracks. Jack orders her to throw him the backpack. Sam threatens to drop the flowers into the pit. Jack threatens to shoot the others. The log breaks. As the others try to reach her, Jack reaches for the backpack. The spider he used earlier escapes from its jar and bites him. He falls into the pit and is devoured. The vine holding Sam also gives way, but she climbs out of the pit, as one of the anacondas tries to get her. Gail tricks the snake into biting their fuel container. Bill shoots it, but the gun is empty. Cole shoots a flare, setting the anaconda on fire and exploding the container, killing the other snakes. An ensuing landslide buries the blood orchids. The survivors\u2014Bill, Sam, Cole and Gail\u2014make it back to the raft and head to Kota Bharu.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Johnny Messner (actor)|Johnny Messner]] as Bill Johnson\n* [[KaDee Strickland]] as Sam Rogers\n* [[Matthew Marsden]] as Dr. Jack Byron\n* [[Eugene Byrd]] as Cole Burris\n* [[Salli Richardson-Whitfield]] as Gail Stern\n* [[Morris Chestnut]] as Gordon Mitchell\n* [[Karl Yune]] as Tran Wu\n* [[Nicholas Gonzalez]] as Dr. Ben Douglas\n* [[Andy Anderson (actor)|Andy Anderson]] as John Livingston\n\n== Soundtrack ==\n{{Infobox album\n| name       = Anacondas: The Hunt for the Blood Orchid (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack)\n| type       = [[Film score]]\n| artist     = [[Nerida Tyson-Chew]]\n| cover      =\n| alt        =\n| released   = August 30, 2004\n| recorded   =\n| venue      =\n| studio     =\n| genre      = [[Soundtrack]]s<br>[[Film score]]s\n| length     = 60:57\n| label      = [[Var\u00e8se Sarabande]]\n| producer   =\n| chronology = ''Anaconda'' soundtrack\n| prev_title = [[Anaconda (film)#Soundtrack|Anaconda]]\n| prev_year  = 1997\n| next_title =\n| next_year  =\n}}\nThe soundtrack for the film was composed by [[Nerida Tyson-Chew]] and released by [[Var\u00e8se Sarabande]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/anacondas-the-hunt-for-the-blood-orchid-original-motion-picture-soundtrack-mw0000391158|title=Anacondas: The Hunt for the Blood Orchid (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack)|website=AllMusic|access-date=April 16, 2018}}</ref>\n\n; Track listing\n# Opening Titles / Jungle Floor (2:12)\n# Elixir Perrinia Immortalis (1:40)\n# Kong Attacks Gail (2:04) \n# Stealing the Fruit / Kong Terrified (3:06)\n# Almost a Kiss (1:20)\n# Predator in the Water (3:53)\n# Enter the Jungle (0:56)\n# Foreboding Path (2:22)\n# Crossing the Bog (3:29)\n# Spider of Anaesthesia (2:58)\n# Livingston's Death (1:05)\n# All Hope is Lost (1:58)\n# Lopaks (1:36)\n# It's Mating Season (3:15)\n# Totem (1:34)\n# Jack's Devious Deal Uncovered (1:23)\n# Betrayal of Trust (2:28)\n# The Cavern (6:31)\n# Climbing to the Light (6:02)\n# Discovering the Orchids / Face Off (11:14)\n\n== Reception ==\n=== Box office ===\n''Anacondas: The Hunt for the Blood Orchid'' debuted at second place in the box office, earned $32,238,923 in the United States and the international gross of $38,753,975, bringing a worldwide total of $70,992,898.<ref name=mojo/>\n\n=== Critical reception ===\n[[Rotten Tomatoes]] reports that the film received a 26% based on 121 reviews, with an average rating of 4.20 out of 10.
