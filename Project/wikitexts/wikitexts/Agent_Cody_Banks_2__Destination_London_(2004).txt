Directed by [[Kevin Allen (director)|Kevin Allen]] and written by [[Don Rhymer]], the film stars [[Frankie Muniz]], [[Anthony Anderson]], [[Hannah Spearritt]] and [[Keith David]]. The film takes place in [[London]] with Cody and his buffoonish adult partner, Derek, trying to recover a stolen software and stop the activation of the government's mind control project.\n\nThe film was released in the [[United States]] on March 12, 2004, and grossed $28&nbsp;million worldwide, against its $26&nbsp;million budget.<ref name=boxofficemojo1/>\n\n==Plot==\nAgent Cody Banks ([[Frankie Muniz]]) attends summer camp, actually a secret facility for training CIA teenage agents. When a group of CIA soldiers attempt to abduct head counselor Victor Diaz ([[Keith Allen (actor)|Keith Allen]]), Cody helps him escape, mistaking the CIA operation for a training exercise. The director informs Cody that Diaz stole disks containing plans for a secret mind-control device, and sends Cody to recapture him.\n\nIn the [[United Kingdom]], Cody poses as a summer orchestra student at the Kenworth estate to spy on owner Lord Duncan Kenworth ([[James Faulkner (actor)|James Faulkner]]), suspected of working with Diaz, supported by his handler, Derek ([[Anthony Anderson]]) and Kumar (Rod Silvers), Derek's right-hand man, who are disguised as a chef hired by Lady Josephine Kenworth ([[Anna Chancellor]]) and a taxi driver respectively. Whilst keeping his mission a secret from his fellow students, Cody sneaks around the estate and confirms that Diaz and Duncan are working together and that they have a working prototype of the mind control device, evidenced when Duncan makes a dog serve drinks and play the piano.\n\nThe next day, Cody breaks into a lab owned by Duncan, where he sees the finished device: a microchip inserted as a filling into a tooth cavity by dentist Santiago ([[Santiago Segura]]). Shortly afterward Cody and Derek chase Diaz, armed with a rocket gun, through London streets, but Cody is captured by the [[Metropolitan Police Service]] and taken to [[Scotland Yard]]. He is later freed by Emily ([[Hannah Spearritt]]), a fellow student who, similar to Cody, is actually a British [[Scotland Yard]] [[Secret Intelligence Service|undercover operative]]. While Emily buys coffee and soda, henchmen sneak up on Cody, knocking him unconscious by drugging him with spray. They capture him and implant him with the microchip.\n\nUnder Duncan, Santiago, and Diaz's influence, Cody meets the CIA director on a London bus who is then also converted. Unknown to them and Cody this is witnessed by Emily from a bus in front. Emily then explains things to Derek that the director alongside Cody is both converted and that they need to get the microchip out of Cody. After knocking out Cody by elbowing him in the face Derek carefully cuts up one of Cody's gadgets, exploding Mentos mints, into a precisely minuscule amount to safely remove it. The group later realizes Diaz's plan: to implant all of the world leaders, who are all in London for a [[G7]] summit at Buckingham Palace, effectively giving him control of the world. He tries to do something to stop him from controlling the world including London but, constantly fails.\n\nDeducing that with the CIA director under Diaz's control, they may be put on a most wanted list, Cody, Derek, and Emily infiltrate the party before the summit. There, they realize that most of the dignitaries have already been implanted due to bizarre behavior and Duncan being appointed director of the Royal Mint by the British Prime Minister (upon accepting this, Duncan cruelly states to Josephine that he is leaving her). They explain the truth to the other students, who perform for the guests and urge them to keep the world leaders from attending the G7 summit. They later proceeded to do so with an impromptu but rousing performance of [[War (Edwin Starr song)|War]], accompanied by dancing and clapping from the assembled dignitaries and Queen Elizabeth herself, whilst Cody, Emily, and Derek search for the villains. Derek is implanted with the microchip and is set on Cody by Santiago. Before Santiago can kill him through Derek, Emily finds and subdues him, disabling the mind control software and rescuing the U.S. President, who was to be implanted.\n\nShortly after Cody kicks out Derek's microchip, the two of them remove the CIA director's microchip. Diaz, realizing that his plan has failed attempts to flee, ends up fighting, and being defeated by Cody in the [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen]]'s gift room, destroying numerous priceless artifacts in the process. Duncan also attempts to escape but is tripped by Trivial Jenkins ([[David Kelly (actor)|David Kelly]]), his apparently senile and blind butler, who turns out to be Emily's handler. Duncan is arrested with Diaz and Santiago.\n\nAfter the villains are arrested, Cody and Emily kiss each other on the cheek before Cody sets off to return to America. Both promised to keep in contact. Alongside Cody returning to America as a reward, Derek also returned to the camp and replaced Diaz as head counselor. Cody's parents pick him up, none the wiser about his dangerous exploits. Alex ([[Connor Widdows]]), Cody's younger brother tries to eat a few of his explosive Mentos, but Cody tosses them into the pond where they explode harmlessly.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Frankie Muniz]] as Cody Banks\n* [[Anthony Anderson]] as Derek Bowman, Cody's new partner\n* [[Hannah Spearritt]] as Emily Sommers\n* [[Keith Allen (actor)|Keith Allen]] as Victor Diaz\n* [[Cynthia Stevenson]] as Mrs. Banks\n* [[Daniel Roebuck]] as Mr. Banks\n* [[Anna Chancellor]] as Lady Josephine Kensworth\n* [[James Faulkner (actor)|James Faulkner]] as Lord Duncan Kensworth\n* [[David Kelly (actor)|David Kelly]] as Trival Jenkins\n* [[Santiago Segura]] as Dr. Santiago\n* [[Connor Widdows]] as Alex Banks, Cody's brother\n* [[Keith David]] as the CIA Director\n* [[Paul Kaye]] as Neville\n* [[Mark Williams (actor)|Mark Williams]] as Inspector Crescent\n* Rod Silvers as Kumar\n* Jack Stanley as Ryan\n* Olivia Adams as Gabrielle\n* Don Jones as George\n* Joshua Brody as Bender\n* Sarah McNicholas as Marisa\n* Leilah Isaac as Sabeen \u2013 Bassoon Player\n* [[Alfie Allen]] as Johan Berchamp\n* Keiron Nelson as Habu \u2013 French Horn Player\n* [[Ray Donn]] as Soldier (uncredited)\n\n==Production==\nThe director of the first Cody Banks film, Harald Zwart, was initially poised to return but left over financial disagreements. MGM executives disputed Zwart\u2019s figures, saying that twice they had bumped up the film\u2019s budget during negotiations to meet his expectations. The proposed budget had moved north of $30 million, with the price rising moderately, as often happens with sequels.<ref>{{Cite web|last1=McNary|first1=David Bloom,Dave|last2=Bloom|first2=David|last3=McNary|first3=Dave|date=2003-04-24|title='Banks 2' suffers helmer withdrawal|url=https://variety.com/2003/film/markets-festivals/banks-2-suffers-helmer-withdrawl-1117885055/|access-date=2021-07-21|website=Variety|language=en-US}}</ref> Director Kevin Allen was offered the directing job after MGM brass were impressed with his indie comedies.
