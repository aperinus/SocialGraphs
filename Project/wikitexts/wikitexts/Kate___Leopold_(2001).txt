The \"Leopold\" in this film is entirely fictional; in fact, Leopold recites his full name in the film as \"Leopold Alexis Elijah Walker Gareth Thomas Mountbatten. -->[[Duke of Albany]], is a stifled dreamer. He has created a design for a primitive [[elevator]], and has built a small model of this device. His strict Uncle Millard has no patience for what he sees as Leopold's frivolous interest in the sciences and new inventions, having brought him to [[New York City]] in order to marry a wealthy American heiress, as the [[Mountbatten family]] is heavily indebted.\n\nWhile sketching the [[Brooklyn Bridge]] during a public meeting dedicated to the completion of its Manhattan tower, Leopold notices Stuart Besser taking photographs with an anachronistically [[Minox|small camera]]. Stuart is an amateur [[physicist]] (and great\u2011great\u2011grandson of Leopold) from 21st\u2011century New York who has discovered the existence of gravitational [[time portal]]s. Later, Leopold catches Stuart in the Duke's study, photographing his schematic diagrams. When Stuart attempts to flee, Leopold follows and tries to save him from falling off the unfinished bridge, only to fall with him into the time portal.\n\nLeopold awakens on a Wednesday morning in the year 2001 in Stuart's apartment at 88 White Street, [[Manhattan]]. Stuart explains that the portal they have travelled through has closed, but will reopen on the next Monday, until which time Leopold should stay in Stuart's apartment. As Stuart takes his dog out, he is injured by falling into the empty elevator shaft and, after ranting about his scientific discovery in the hospital, is involuntarily committed to a mental institution. According to Stuart's concept, Leopold's unintentional time travel to the 21st century has caused a widespread \"occlusion\" of elevators, and may cause the disappearance of Stuart himself if Leopold doesn't go back to 1876 on Monday.\n\nLeopold is intrigued by the cynical and ambitious Kate McKay, Stuart's ex-girlfriend who lives downstairs. He says that she produces the impression of a \"career woman\" and, upon learning that she works in [[market research]], ironically remarks, \"Mm. A fine avocation for women, research. Perfect for the feminine mind.\" (Later on, Kate's boss tells her the same thing, \"You skew male. You're like a man. A man who understands women\u2014their desires, their needs. You understand them but you're not really one of them.\") Kate shrugs it off and demands that Leopold take Stuart's dog for a walk. Back at the apartment, he befriends Charlie\u2014Kate's brother and an aspiring actor, who believes him to be an actor as well, steadfast to his character.\n\nOn Thursday morning, Kate becomes impressed by Leopold's eloquent exposition of how important the tastiness of food is to the quality of human life. She takes him to an audition for a TV commercial pitching a fat-free butter, Farmer's Bounty, produced by the English company Jansen Foods, which is being taken over by Kate's company, Camden Research Group. After the successful audition, Kate and Leopold stop by a horse-drawn tourist carriage to hail a taxi, at which moment a thief snatches Kate's briefcase and flees into [[Central Park]]. Seeing Kate run after the purse-snatcher, Leopold borrows one of the horses and hurries to help her. Riding together with Kate, he drives the thief into an impasse and forces him to drop the briefcase. Bedazzled by the sight of Leopold riding on a white horse to her rescue, Kate begins to admit that his 19th century dukedom may be \"for real\".\n\nOn Friday, Leopold hires a violinist and invites Kate to a rooftop dinner, which ends with a waltz and the first kiss.\n\nOn Saturday, they take a stroll about [[Lower Manhattan]] and come across Uncle Millard's home at [[1 Hanover Square]], where Leopold retrieves a metal box with his boyhood treasures, including his mother's ring, from a secret drawer hidden in his room's wall. In the evening, he tries to propose to Kate, but she falls asleep on his lap.\n\nOn Sunday, Leopold acts in a Farmer's Bounty commercial, but walks off the set upon finding the diet margarine disgusting. Leopold chastises Kate about integrity, to which she counters that he lacks connection with reality. Realizing that their time together is nearly over, both spend the evening in subdued contemplation.\n\nOn Monday morning, Stuart escapes from the asylum and sends Leopold to his own time, which makes the elevators work again. Charlie notices Kate in a photo taken at Leopold's ball on 28 April 1876, and shows the picture to Stuart, who realizes that Kate's future is in the past. That night, when Kate is about to accept her promotion at the Anglo-American merger meeting held, to her surprise, at [[1 Hanover Square]], Stuart and Charlie tell her that in order to be with Leopold she has to jump off the Brooklyn Bridge within the next 23 minutes. Kate rejects their suggestion as absurd and goes to give her acceptance speech, during which she sees herself, wearing the same evening dress, in one of Stuart's photos. She abruptly ends the speech, and the three of them rush to the bridge.\n\nHaving made it through the portal, Kate appears in 1876 and runs to [[1 Hanover Square]], where the Anglo-American engagement is to take place. Just when Leopold is about to announce his bride of convenience, Kate storms into the ballroom, and he instead announces her name, styled as \"Kate McKay, of the McKays of [[Massapequa, New York|Massapequa]]\". Among the shocked guests, Kate and Leopold reunite with a kiss and dance a bridal waltz. Thus Kate turns out to be Stuart's great\u2011great\u2011grandmother.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Meg Ryan]] as Kate McKay\n* [[Hugh Jackman]] as His Grace Leopold Alexis Elijah Walker Thomas Gareth Mountbatten, 3rd Duke of Albany\n* [[Liev Schreiber]] as Stuart Besser\n* [[Breckin Meyer]] as Charlie McKay\n* [[Natasha Lyonne]] as Darci\n* [[Bradley Whitford]] as J.
