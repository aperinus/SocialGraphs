Jackson]]. It is the second collaboration of Travolta and Jackson, following 1994's ''[[Pulp Fiction]]''. The story follows a DEA agent solving the mystery of a bungled training exercise that leads to the deaths of multiple Army Ranger cadets and their instructor. ''Basic'' received negative reviews from critics regarding its overall plot and numerous twist endings. It was a [[box-office bomb]], grossing only $42.8 million worldwide against a $50 million budget.\n\n==Plot==\nDuring a [[live fire exercise]] in the jungles of [[Panama]], a team of [[United States Army Rangers|Army Rangers]] trainees is led by the fearsome instructor [[Master Sergeant]] Nathan West. [[Sergeant]] Ray Dunbar emerges from the jungle carrying wounded [[Second Lieutenant]] Levi Kendall. The two men are pursued by Sergeant Mueller, whom Dunbar kills in [[self-defense]]. Although no other bodies are found, West's team is presumed dead.\n\nDunbar refuses to talk to [[Military Police Corps (United States)|Military Police]] investigator [[Captain]] Julia Osborne and insists on speaking to a fellow Ranger from outside the base, drawing an '8' on a piece of paper. The [[base commander|post commander]] [[Colonel]] Bill Styles calls in his friend: experienced interrogator, ex-Ranger and now [[Drug Enforcement Administration|DEA]] agent Tom Hardy, and assigns him to aid Osborne.\n\nDuring interrogations of the survivors, they learn that West was infamous for being a ruthless, tough-as-nails sergeant. One of the trainees, Jay Pike, earned West's wrath for not following orders, and may have staged the murder.\n\nKendall, son of a [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]] general and a [[homosexual]], claims West hated him and may have ordered a \"training accident\" on him. He claims West died when hit in the back with a [[smoke grenade|phosphorus grenade]]. When Pike confessed to the crime, Dunbar wanted to turn him in; a firefight ensued and most of the trainees were killed.\n\nDunbar claims Kendall is lying and that Mueller and his fellow trainee Castro were illegally selling prescription drugs and West became aware of their drug dealing. Mueller used Pike's grenade to kill West and tried to frame Pike since Pike uses drugs to numb his pain. A firefight broke out and several trainees were killed. Dunbar claims that Dr. Peter Vilmer supplied the drugs and falsified drug tests so that soldiers came out clean. Shocked that her own boyfriend could done such a thing, Osborne and Hardy confront the doctor. Vilmer denies the accusation but is struck in the head by Osborne with a book until he confesses and is placed under arrest.\n\nStyles orders Osborne and Hardy not to talk to Kendall again. They disobey and interrogate Kendall once more, but he suddenly begins vomiting blood. Before dying, he draws an '8' with his own blood on Osborne's hand. Hardy explains a rumor about a group of ex-Rangers in Panama calling themselves \"[[Section 8 (military)|Section 8]]\". They apparently trained under West, turned rogue and became drug dealers.\n\nStyles is furious since Kendall's father will go after his throat for the death of his son; he relieves Osborne of duty and tells Hardy to leave. He considers the investigation closed and a [[United States Army Criminal Investigation Command|CID]] transport from Washington arrives to take Vilmer and Dunbar away.\n\nVilmer accidentally reveals that 'Dunbar' is actually Pike, and Hardy removes Pike from the plane just before takeoff. Pike explains that West learned about the actual operation going on at the base: cocaine smuggling. He confronted the Rangers and threatened to turn them in to authorities. After a brief firefight, West and the other trainees were killed. Pike took Dunbar's [[dog tag]]s and carried Kendall to the [[extraction (military)|extraction]] point. He then gives Hardy, Osborne, and Styles the number of a crate where Vilmer had stowed cocaine.\n\nHardy confronts Styles, determining he was behind the drug-dealing operation the whole time. When West reported the operation to Styles, Styles ordered Mueller and Kendall to kill him in the jungle, then poisoned Kendall to silence him. Styles tries to bribe Hardy before attempting to shoot him; Styles is instead shot and killed by Osborne, who was eavesdropping on their talk.\n\nAs the investigation concludes, Osborne suspects that Hardy is somehow involved in the incident; this is confirmed when she watches Pike sneak into Hardy's car. She follows them into Panama City, where they enter a bar with a big [[eight-ball]] hanging above. After going inside, she is greeted by West and the missing members of the team \u2014 Castro, Dunbar, and Nu\u00f1ez, who Hardy reveals as his 'colleagues'.\n\nThey explain that Section 8 is a covert [[Black operation|black-ops]] anti-drug unit led by Colonel Tom Hardy; the \"insane mercenary\" story is a cover to spook the cartels. The agents infiltrated the base undercover to investigate cocaine trafficking and discovered Mueller, Kendall and Vilmer were responsible. West, not realizing Styles was also involved, informed him of the drug dealing. The training mission became a covert Section 8 operation to circumvent Mueller and Kendall and fake West's death in order to extract West from leadership and transfer him to Section 8. Hardy was called in to confirm Styles' and Vilmer's involvement.\n\nImpressed by her work, Hardy offers Osborne a job in the unit.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[John Travolta]] as DEA Agent (later Colonel) Tom Hardy\n*[[Connie Nielsen]] as Captain Julia Osborne\n*[[Samuel L.
