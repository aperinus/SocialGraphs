The film was [[film producer|produced]] by Todd Black, [[Randa Haines]], and Washington and features a [[soundtrack]] by [[Mychael Danna]].\n\nBlack was first inspired to make the film upon hearing the story from Fisher, who was then working as a [[security guard]] at [[Sony Pictures Studios]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}\n\n==Plot==\nThe film focuses on Antwone \"Fish\" Fisher, a temperamental young man from [[Cleveland, Ohio]] with a violent history who is serving in the [[U.S. Navy]]. His father was killed before he was born and his teenage mother, Eva Mae Fisher, ended up arrested soon after and put in jail, where she gave birth to him. He was then placed in an orphanage until such time as she was released and could claim him. Since she had not yet claimed him, at the age of two Antwone was placed in a foster home run by a couple, Mr. and Mrs. Tate. Antwone suffers years of physical and emotional abuse at Mrs. Tate's hands, and is [[child sexual abuse|molested]] by her adult niece Nadine. He finally leaves the home at age 14. After living out on the streets for the next few years, he decides to join the U.S. Navy to make something out of his life.\n\nThe rough life he had as a child has caused him to have a violent temper; after getting into a fight with a fellow sailor, Antwone is sentenced at a [[Mast (naval)|captain's mast]] to be demoted, fined, and restricted to the ship for 45 days. His commanding officer also orders him to go to psychiatric treatment. Antwone goes in to meet Dr. Jerome Davenport, who attempts to get him to open up. Antwone is at first extremely resistant, but gradually comes to trust Davenport and opens up about his traumatic childhood. Meanwhile, Antwone develops feelings for fellow Navy sailor Cheryl. With Antwone still getting into altercations, Davenport tries to explore his feelings for Cheryl in order to channel Antwone's feelings into something positive. Antwone finally goes on a date with Cheryl and establishes a relationship with her.\n\nWhile on leave in Mexico, Antwone gets into a fight with a sailor who insinuates that he is gay, and is thrown into jail. Davenport meets him in jail, where Antwone confides the sexual abuse he suffered as a child. Antwone eventually reveals to Cheryl that he sees a psychiatrist.\n\nAt a [[Thanksgiving]] dinner, Davenport advises Antwone to find his real family. Antwone refuses, but thanks Davenport before inviting him to a graduation ceremony. Following the graduation ceremony, Davenport tells Antwone that he's ending the sessions and feels Antwone needs to progress on his own. Antwone breaks down, feeling everyone has abandoned him. He reveals his best friend Jesse was killed while attempting a robbery, and that he resents Jesse for leaving him behind. Realizing he needs to find his parents to find closure, Antwone asks Cheryl to go with him to Cleveland. After a dead end at social services, Antwone decides to return to the Tate household. There he confronts Nadine and Mrs. Tate about their abuse. Mrs. Tate ultimately reveals Antwone's father's name: Edward Elkins.\n\nAfter looking through multiple telephone books, Antwone comes into contact with his aunt Annette and visits her. Antwone learns his mother lives nearby, and goes to visit her. Antwone finds closure, forgives her, and leaves. When he returns to the Elkins household, he finds a feast prepared for him and finds the family he lost.\n\nAntwone visits Davenport and thanks him for everything. Davenport then replies that it is he who should be thanking Antwone. Davenport confesses that he had been failing to deal with his own problems, and that treating Antwone prompted him to finally confront his demons. The film draws to a close as Davenport and Antwone go to eat.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Derek Luke]] as Ship's Serviceman Third Class/Seaman [[Antwone Fisher|Antwone \"Fish\" Fisher]]\n**[[Malcolm David Kelley]] as Antwone Fisher (age 7)\n**Cory Hodges as Antwone Fisher (age 14)\n*[[Joy Bryant]] as Petty Officer Second Class Cheryl Smolley\n*[[Denzel Washington]] as Lt.

The film generally follows the plot of the novel. However, the book proceeds in a linear fashion while the movie is explained through various flashbacks. The movie stresses Antwone's relationship with his doctor as opposed to the book, which chronicles Antwone's entire life.\n\n==Production==\nAntwone Fisher explains in his novel ''[[Finding Fish]]'', that he took a free screenwriting class at Bethel A.M.E. Church after a chance encounter with a limo driver. The class was taught by Chris Smith, who delivered an introduction to a producer named [[Todd Black]]. Black was impressed with Fisher's story. Black reviewed the script for a week and told Fisher that though he couldn't make a deal, he wanted to hire him full-time as a screenwriter. Fisher wrote 41 drafts until the script was sold by Black to [[20th Century Fox]], who ultimately released it under their [[Fox Searchlight Pictures]] banner. The film marks the directorial debut of Denzel Washington, the first screenwriting credit for Antwone Fisher, and the first feature film-role for [[Derek Luke]]. Washington was brought the script originally just to play the part of Jerome Davenport. But Washington's agent called Black and told him he not only wanted to act in the film, he wanted it to be his directorial debut.\n\nFisher had known Luke as a young actor working at the [[Sony Pictures]] gift shop while he was writing the screenplay. Fisher encouraged Luke to try out for the part. An audition with casting director Robi Reed-Humes went well enough that Luke was called in to meet with Washington.<ref>[http://www.newsday.com/lifestyle/for-director-washington-his-spirit-fit-derek-luke-was-a-natural-for-the-role-of-antwone-fisher-1.461717 \"For Director Washington, His Spirit Fit/Derek Luke was a natural for the role of Antwone Fisher\"], \"Newsday\", Jan. 5, 2003</ref> Washington was impressed with Luke's audition and asked that he personally deliver the good news. Washington (aware that he was working with an unknown) stated that he wanted to give a younger generation of black actors their chance to come alive on-screen. To prepare the cast, Washington required each actor to know his/her character's history and story inside out before coming to the set. This mandate included everyone from Luke in the title role to key cast members like [[Vern\u00e9e Watson Johnson]], who plays Fisher's long-lost Aunt Annette, [[Novella Nelson]] in the role of Fisher's foster mother, Mrs. Tate, [[Viola Davis]] as Fisher's mother, newcomer De'Angelo K. Wilson, seen opposite rapper [[Eminem]] in ''[[8 Mile (film)|8 Mile]]'', as the grown-up Jesse, [[Malcolm David Kelley]] as the young Antwone, and Corey Hodges as the teenage Antwone. Washington repeatedly told the cast and crew \u201cWe\u2019re doing it for Antwone.\u201d\n\nInspired by the story of a man who found hope and love through the help of an outstretched hand. In turn, the filmmakers sought to give back to the communities that supported them during the shoot. In the Cleveland neighborhood where the scenes of Fisher's youth and homecoming were shot, the filmmakers went out of their way to leave the urban area and its people in a better place than when they arrived. Structures like the apartment building where Eva Mae Fisher lived in the film and the house that was shot as Fisher's foster home were renovated and/or reinforced. Members of the community were hired to work on the production or as part of its preparation, and Washington was often out and about meeting people, shaking hands and offering thanks for their help.<ref name=\"prod\">{{cite web|url=http://www.cinema.com/articles/1509/antwone-fisher-production-notes.phtml|title=Antwone Fisher:Production Notes|access-date=2011-02-11}}</ref>\n\n==''The Slave Community''==\n{{further|The Slave Community}}\n\nThe book ''The Slave Community'', written by American historian [[John W. Blassingame]] and referenced in the film, was one of the first historical studies of slavery in the United States. The book contradicted others which suggested that African American slaves were largely submissive. Blassingame used psychology to determine the mentality developed by slaves during the era and possibly passed on to generations after.\n\nDavenport suggests that Antwone read the book to understand why Mrs. Tate abused him. Davenport does not intend to justify her actions, but he seeks to help Antwone understand where her mentality of beatings and verbal abuse to keep the foster children subservient came from. Antwone is seen briefly reading the book in the next scene.\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Author's reaction to the film===\n<blockquote>When I saw the film for the first time, I was overwhelmed by a mixture of feelings: fear, joy, pride and satisfaction\u2014all of which still linger, and I am certain they will for the rest of my life. I hope others, too, walk away with those same feelings and the courage to do something to better the lives of children in general. I hope that after seeing the movie and reading my memoir that people will see that every child has value and boundless potential and that even if all one has to give is an encouraging word as a genuine gesture of care. ... that gift alone can save a child's life and give hope for the future.\n:\u2014 Antwone Fisher<ref name=\"prod\" /></blockquote>\n\n===Reviews===\nReview aggregate website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reported that 78% of critics gave the film positive write-ups based on 150 reviews. The website critic consensus says, \"Washington's directing debut is a solidly crafted, emotionally touching work.\" Praise was given especially towards Washington's directing and Luke's performance.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/antwone_fisher/|title=Antwone Fisher|website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |access-date=2022-03-15}}</ref> [[Metacritic]] gave the movie a score of 62 based on 30 reviews, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.metacritic.com/movie/antwone-fisher|title= Antwone Fisher Reviews|website=Metacritic}}</ref> Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film a rare \"A+\" grade.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thewrap.com/movies-a-plus-cinemascore-lord-of-rings-harry-potter-black-panther-photos/|title=53 Movies With A+ CinemaScore Since 2000, From 'Remember the Titans' to 'Just Mercy' (Photos)|date=2020-01-12|website=TheWrap|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-02}}</ref>\n\n===Awards===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"font-size: 100%;\"\n|-  style=\"background:#ccc; text-align:center;\"\n! scope=\"col\" | Year\n! scope=\"col\" | Ceremony\n! scope=\"col\" | Category\n! scope=\"col\" | Nominee\n! scope=\"col\" | Result\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"6\"| 2002\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | American Film Institute Awards\n| Top 10 of 2000\n| ''Antwone Fisher''\n| {{won}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | National Board of Review\n| Breakthrough Performance\n| [[Derek Luke]]\n| {{won}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"2\" | Producers Guild of America\n| rowspan=\"2\" | Stanley Kramer Award \n| [[Denzel Washington]]\n| rowspan=\"2\" {{won}}\n|-\n| [[Todd Black]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Writers Guild of America Award\n| Best Original Screenplay\n| [[Antwone Fisher]]\n| {{nom}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"10\" | 2003\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"7\" | Black Reel Awards\n| Best Film\n| ''Antwone Fisher''\n| {{won}}\n|-\n| Best Director\n| [[Denzel Washington]]\n| {{won}}\n|-\n| Best Actor\n| [[Derek Luke]]\n| {{won}}\n|-\n| Best Supporting Actor\n| [[Denzel Washington]]\n| {{nom}}\n|-\n| Best Supporting Actress\n| [[Joy Bryant]]\n| {{nom}}\n|-\n| Best Screenplay, Adapted or Original\n| [[Antwone Fisher]]\n| {{won}}\n|-\n| Best Breakthrough Performance\n| [[Derek Luke]]\n| {{won}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"2\" | Independent Spirit Awards\n| Best Male Lead\n| [[Derek Luke]]\n| {{won}}\n|-\n| Best Supporting Female\n| [[Viola Davis]]\n| {{nom}}\n|-\n|}\n\n==Resources==\n*Blassingame, John W.
