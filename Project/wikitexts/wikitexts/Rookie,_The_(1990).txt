Kazanjian]], Steven Siebert and David Valdes. It was written from a screenplay conceived by [[Boaz Yakin]] and [[Scott Spiegel]]. The film stars [[Charlie Sheen]], Clint Eastwood, [[Raul Julia]], [[S\u00f4nia Braga]], [[Lara Flynn Boyle]], and [[Tom Skerritt]]. Eastwood plays a veteran police officer teamed up with a younger detective played by Sheen (the rookie), whose intent is to take down a German crime lord in downtown Los Angeles, following months of investigation into an exotic car theft ring.\n\n''The Rookie'' premiered in the United States and Canada on December 7, 1990, grossing $21,633,874 in ticket receipts, just under its budget of $30 million. The film was overshadowed by the continuing success of ''[[Home Alone (film)|Home Alone]]'', which opened three weeks earlier and ended up being one of the top 100 highest-grossing films of all time. A financial disappointment, ''The Rookie'' was met with generally lackluster reviews. Critics considered it formulaic and shallow, and expressed bewilderment at the casting of the Puerto Rican Julia and the Brazilian Braga as Germans; a scene in which Eastwood is raped by Braga also generated some controversy. There was, however, some praise for the stunts and special effects.\n\n==Plot==\nNick Pulovski and his partner are assigned to the case of taking down the criminal empire of a German felon, Strom, who engages in [[Motor vehicle theft|grand theft auto]] for his [[chop shop]] operations. During an encounter with Strom and his men, who are loading a semi-trailer truck with stolen cars, Pulovski's partner is shot dead by Strom. Nick, despite efforts to catch the criminals on the highway, ends up losing them and is subsequently taken off the case by Lt. Raymond Garcia, who assigns him a new partner, David Ackerman, a rookie cop only recently promoted to detective.\n\nAgainst orders, Nick continues investigating Strom's gang and dealing with David's lack of experience, particularly a bar brawl during which David's badge is stolen by one of Strom's men, Loco. While attending the birthday party of David's mother, Nick meets David's wealthy father, Eugene, who attempts to bribe Nick to protect David no matter what. Nick threatens one of Strom's men, Morales, into helping him. Morales manages to plant a two-way radio inside Strom's house, but he is found out and killed by Strom and his lover, Liesl. While listening in on Strom's plans to flee the country, Nick and David ambush Strom at a casino, but David botches the operation when he cannot bring himself to shoot Liesl. He is shot in the back, but survives with his bulletproof vest, while Strom takes Nick hostage and demands a $2 million ransom.\n\nHaunted by accidentally causing his little brother's death during their childhood and by his failure to help Nick, David finally snaps and goes on a brutal rampage, interrogating as many of Strom's associates as possible. He finds another of Strom's men, Little Felix, garroted to death in his own shop, and barely escapes the same fate by Loco, who escapes before David can subdue him. In desperation, David approaches his father to supply the ransom money in case he fails. David calls his girlfriend, Sarah, who tells him that Garcia is waiting to speak to him at their home, but detectives sent by Garcia intercept David for police brutality. Realizing that Loco is posing as Garcia, David escapes and races home to intercept Loco before he kills Sarah. They clash violently until Sarah shoots Loco dead. Though David needed Loco alive, Loco's car directs him to a garage where he and Nick had previously seen it.\n\nAt Strom's garage, Nick manages to free himself, steals a revolver and attempts to escape but is cornered by Strom and Liesl. David arrives and chases them off, and they barely escape the garage before Strom detonates the explosives inside it. Catching Strom's contact sent to collect the money, Nick and David reach Strom at the airport and a long chase ensues. Strom's pilot is shot in the head, causing him to crash into another plane, while Nick and David pursue Strom and Liesl into the airport. David shoots and kills Liesl, while Nick runs out of bullets and is shot by Strom. David shoots Strom in the shoulder while Strom shoots David in the leg. Heedless to Strom's request for medical aid, Nick shoots him dead.\n\nSometime later, Nick, David and Garcia have been promoted. As the new lieutenant, Nick assigns David another rookie partner.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Clint Eastwood]] as Sergeant Nick Pulovski\n* [[Charlie Sheen]] as Detective David Ackerman\n* Seth Allen as Young David Ackerman\n* [[Raul Julia]] as Ulrich Sigmund Strom\n* [[S\u00f4nia Braga]] as Liesl Strom; Braga previously co-starred with Julia as his lover in ''[[Kiss of the Spider Woman (film)|Kiss of the Spider Woman]]''\n* [[Tom Skerritt]] as Eugene Ackerman\n* [[Lara Flynn Boyle]] as Sarah Ackerman\n* [[Pepe Serna]] as Lieutenant Raymond Garcia\n* Donna Mitchell as Laura Ackerman\n* [[Coleby Lombardo]] as Joey Ackerman\n* [[Marco Rodr\u00edguez (actor)|Marco Rodriguez]] as \"Loco\" Martinez\n* [[Xander Berkeley]] as Ken Blackwell\n* [[Roberta Vasquez]] as Officer Heather Torres\n* [[Hal Williams]] as Detective Powell\n* [[Paul Ben-Victor]] as Felix \"Little Felix\"\n* [[Tony Plana]] as Morales\n* David Sherrill as Max\n* Pete Randall as Cruz\n* [[Matt McKenzie]] as Detective Wang\n* [[Joel Polis]] as Detective Lance\n* Robert Harvey as Detective Whalen\n* George Orrison as Detective Orrison\n* Paul Butler as Captain Hargate\n* Anthony Charnota as Romano\n* Nick Ballo as Vito\n* Jay Boryea as Sal\n* Anthony Alexander as Alphonse\n* Jeanne Mori as Reporter Connie Ling\n* [[Jordan Lund]] as The Bartender\n* [[Kyle Eastwood]] as Band Member At Ackerman's House Party (uncredited)\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n\n===Sets and equipment===\nWithin California, filming was done primarily on location in [[Saratoga, California|Saratoga]], [[San Jose, California|San Jose]] and Los Angeles.<ref name=\"Hughes78\">Hughes, Howard (September 1, 2009).

Green]]. [[Stunt coordinator]] Terry Leonard and second unit director [[Buddy Van Horn]], oversaw the task of integrating the scope of [[stunt]] people working to produce the action which numbered over twice as many actors in the film (said to be over 80 stuntmen),<ref name=\"Hughes78\"/><ref>Rausch, Andrew J.

He detailed how the crew would \"go in with these little ceiling units, as close to the ceiling as we could get them, little accent lights onto the place the actors would be. It would look like it was coming from those practicals but, again, at a dramatic angle.\"<ref name=\"Slam\" /> Describing a stunt-related sequence early in the film performed by Eastwood himself, Van Horn, who had been a stunt associate for almost 35 years, took the opportunity to commend the actor on his contributions saying, \"Clint likes to do everything live, ... When you read the script, you know everything is going to be pretty much live action. Sometimes you have to talk him out of something that just might be a little too risky. Not that he couldn't do it, but if something even minor should happen, you couldn't afford to suspend the production.\"<ref name=\"Rookie\" /> The sequence which Van Horn alluded to, was a scene that involved Eastwood behind the driver's seat racing a Chevrolet Blazer through stop-and-go traffic, while swerving to avoid oncoming cars from the opposite direction. The scene included 20 other stunt drivers operating a carefully rehearsed formation through a head-on collision course. According to Van Horn, who engineered the sequence with Leonard, he noted, \"The whole thing is like a football play, ... We all sit down and figure out where the cars are, where Clint makes the break out of traffic, where the other cars are going, and just the whole cause and effect for how and why he pulls into (the intersection) and decides to head on through. That's all worked out ahead of time.\"<ref name=\"Rookie\" /> Leonard added, \"In a situation where your rehearsal time is extremely limited, it becomes that old expression: experience, ... It becomes a seat of the pants kind of thing, about 20 drivers and Clint who know where the close calls are going to be and who's going to be in what position when. But once you get going, there's always the element of surprise, where maybe a car is 10 feet closer than it was expected to be, and a driver must react to that.\"<ref name=\"Rookie\" />\n\nSpeaking on the origins of the film, Eastwood mentioned \"I have a project for this spring that will be full of action. It's another cop picture, very different from this one. It has its own character and if it's done well it can turn out to be something good. Charlie Sheen will play the rookie and I'll play the mature cop.\"<ref>Kapsis, Robert E. and Coblentz, Kathie (May 1, 1999). ''Clint Eastwood: Interviews''.

For the scene, a 1,500 pound Mercedes auto mock-up was connected by 150 feet of quarter-inch pulleyed cable to a Ford 4\u00d74 pickup on the ground.<ref name=\"Rookie\" /> The truck would drive straight ahead and pull the Mercedes through the windows as the cable that connected the two vehicles exhibited a tensile strength of 8,000 pounds.<ref name=\"Rookie\" /> Once the pull on the cable started, both vehicles would move in precise proportion to one another. After the mock-up launched through the windows, the hook connecting the Mercedes would drop. As Frazier explained, \"The hook is very similar to the kind used to launch jets on aircraft carriers, ... Once the hook falls away, the Mercedes is propelled by its own momentum.\"<ref name=\"Rookie\" /> [[Aerodynamics]] played a key role in the execution, as Frazier referred to the stunt saying, \"When the car left the building it was very important that it exit and travel flat, ... A lot of times it doesn't matter. In this case, if the car didn't travel flat, you would know that the car could not have survived into the next sequence where it landed on the rooftop. We had to set up aerodynamics on that car, so that every time it went out the window, including the tests, it flew out without the nose dipping down.\"<ref name=\"Rookie\" /> The explosion filled destruction of the warehouse was produced by 9 separate 18-inch steel mortars on each of the 4 floors. When fully discharged, all 36 mortars produced the largest orchestrated explosion ever allowed in Los Angeles city limits permitted at the time.<ref name=\"Rookie\" />\n\n{|class=\"toccolours\" style=\"float: right; margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 2em; font-size: 85%; color:black; width:40em; max-width: 35%;\" cellspacing=\"5\"\n|style=\"text-align: left;\"|\"''When the car left the building it was very important that it exit and travel flat, ...

We had to set up aerodynamics on that car, so that every time it went out the window, including the tests, it flew out without the nose dipping down.''\"\n|-\n|style=\"text-align: left;\"|\u2014John Frazier, stunt supervisor\n|}\nAnother major stunt sequence consisted of a {{convert|50|ft|m|adj=mid|-long}}, 21-ton two-tiered automobile carrier flipping over on its side, flinging its automotive cargo onto a freeway of traffic. In the sequence, the carrier is scripted to disconnect from the primary cab at highway speed, so that the carrier veers off to one side while eventually flipping over. Frazier explained how \"Clint did not want the car carrier rolling over and over down the freeway, ... He just wanted it to go over on its side and then slide until it stopped. It would have been easier to load that thing up (with cars), get up to speed and 'barrel' roll it down the freeway. But it wouldn't have looked realistic for his character to have survived it.\"<ref name=\"Rookie\" /> A semi-truck which was trailing 150 feet behind the carrier, held on to it by means of a cable. After the carrier became detached from the passenger cab, the semi-truck came to a stop yanking the carrier from the cab.<ref name=\"Rookie\" /> Frazier demonstrated how [[gravity]] played a significant and key role during the scene. He noted, \"By itself, the carrier would not have come off the (cab), ... It could ride there forever, even though it's been released, just due to the weight of the carrier. So we needed the 'holdback' cable to the truck behind, and on cue, the driver locked his brakes.\"<ref name=\"Rookie\" /> After the carrier disengaged from the cab, steel castor wheels attached to the underside of the carrier directed it to the center embankment. A stuntman who was riding in the carrier fired 3 cannons to physically lift it over on its side.<ref name=\"Rookie\" />\n\nA small jet aircraft, ([[Hamburger Flugzeugbau HFB-320 Hansa Jet|Hansa-Jet]]), pursuing the lead characters played by Eastwood and Sheen, complements another tightly coordinated stunt scene (aerial coordinators James W. Gavin and Eric W. Gray). After chasing the two detectives through a grassy area, the Hansa-Jet is hit by a [[Convair 880]] depicted as landing, (the initial sequence showing the aircraft on approach uses a [[BAe 146]]).<ref name=\"Rookie\" /> Both the San Jose and Mojave airports were scripted as LA International Airport during filming of the scene.<ref name=\"Rookie\" /> Right before the impact, the Hansa-Jet was actually stationary being pulled by a 150-foot steel cable attached to a 4-wheel drive pickup truck right before the explosion erupted. Frazier explained, \"The reason we did that is because if the planes collide first, it's likely they'll upend all our wires and the explosion wouldn't occur at all. Another reason is that had the Hansa-Jet not demolished before impact, it could have spun the other plane around, and we might have ended up with the 880 in our shot instead.<ref name=\"Rookie\" /> The ensuing explosion after the Convair dissects the Hansa-Jet was powered by 10 gallons of gasoline and 4 separate 18-inch mortars. The detonation device included a 125-foot electrical cable set off by a bull switch to help achieve the desired effect.<ref name=\"Rookie\" />\n\n===Music===\nThe [[Film score|score]] for the film which included elements of [[jazz]] music and considerable use of the trumpet, was originally composed by American [[saxophonist]] [[Lennie Niehaus]].<ref name=\"DVD\" /> The music score was mixed by Robert Fernandez and edited by Donald Harris. The sound effects in the film were supervised by [[Robert G. Henderson]] and [[Alan Robert Murray]].<ref name=\"DVD\" /> The mixing of the sound effects were orchestrated by Donald F. Johnson and Michael Evje.<ref name=\"DVD\" /> Although not officially released, music from the soundtrack included songs entitled ''\"All The Things You Are\"'' written by [[Jerome Kern]] and [[Oscar Hammerstein II]] as well as the ''\"Red Zone\"'' written by [[Kyle Eastwood]] and Michael Stevens.<ref name=\"DVD\" />\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Critical response===\nThe film received mostly negative reviews from critics.

It's all there on the screen, but lifeless.\" On another negative front, Ebert also criticized Sheen's performance, saying he kept \"a poker face and laconic voice through much of the movie, and doesn't generate the kind of vigor and intensity the role needs; a more nervous actor might have been a better choice.\"<ref>Ebert, Roger (December 7, 1990).
