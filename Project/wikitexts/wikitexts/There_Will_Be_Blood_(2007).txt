Dragging himself from the pit, he takes a sample to an assay office and receives a silver and gold [[land claim|claim]]. In 1902, [[history of oil in California through 1930|he discovers oil near Los Angeles]] and establishes a drilling company. Following the death of a worker in an accident, Daniel adopts the man's orphaned son. The boy, H.W., becomes his nominal business partner, allowing Daniel to present himself to potential investors as a family man.\n\nIn 1911, Daniel is approached by Paul Sunday, a young man who tells him of an oil deposit under his family's property in Little Boston, California. Daniel visits the Sundays' property and meets Paul's [[identical twin]] brother Eli, who is a local preacher. Daniel attempts to purchase the farm from the Sundays at a bargain price under the ruse of using it to hunt quail, but his motives are questioned by Eli who knows the land has drilling potential. In exchange for the rights to the property, Eli demands $10,000 for his church. An agreement is made and Daniel acquires all the available land in and around the Sunday property, save for one holdout, William Bandy, after he neglected to negotiate with him.\n\nEli asks for permission to bless the well before drilling begins; Daniel initially agrees, but then refuses to allow it when the time comes. Oil drilling begins and a series of misfortunes occur: an accident kills one worker and a [[blowout (well drilling)|gas blowout]] deafens H.W. and destroys the drilling infrastructure. Eli blames the disasters on the well not having been properly blessed. When Eli publicly demands the money still owed to him, Daniel beats and humiliates him. At the dinner table that night, Eli attacks and berates his father for having trusted Daniel.\n\nA man arrives at Daniel's doorstep claiming to be his half-brother, Henry. Daniel hires him and the two grow close. A jealous H.W. sets fire to their house, intending to kill Henry. Daniel sends H.W. away to a school for the deaf in [[San Francisco]]. A representative from [[Standard Oil]] offers to buy out Daniel's local interests, but, after a perceived slight, Daniel refuses and instead strikes a deal with [[Union Oil]] to build a pipeline to the California coast. However, Bandy's ranch remains an impediment.\n\nReminiscing about their childhood home, Daniel becomes suspicious of Henry's story and confronts him one night at gunpoint. \"Henry\" confesses that he was a friend of the real Henry, who had in fact died of [[tuberculosis]], and that he had impersonated Henry in the hope that Daniel could give him a job. In a fit of rage, Daniel murders the impostor and buries his body. Daniel then drinks heavily and weeps.\n\nThe next morning, Daniel is awakened by Bandy, who knows of Daniel's crime and wants Daniel to publicly repent in Eli's church in exchange for being given an [[easement]] for the pipeline running across  his land. As part of his [[baptism]], Eli humiliates Daniel and coerces him into confessing that he had abandoned his son. Some time later, while the pipeline is being built, H.W. is reunited with Daniel, and Eli leaves Little Boston to go do missionary work.\n\nIn 1927, H.W. marries Mary Sunday, the younger sister of Paul and Eli. He visits Daniel, who is now a wealthy, [[alcoholism|alcoholic]] recluse living in a large mansion. Through a [[language interpretation|sign language interpreter]], H.W. asks his father to dissolve their partnership so that he can establish his own independent drilling company in [[Mexico]]. Daniel reacts angrily and mocks H.W.'s deafness before revealing his true origins as a \"bastard from a basket\". H.W. tells Daniel he is glad that they are not related and walks out; Daniel continues to jeer at H.W. as he departs.\n\nWhile Daniel, drunk, is in the private [[bowling alley]] in his mansion, he is visited by Eli, who is now a radio preacher. Eli offers to sell Daniel the property rights to the Bandy ranch, since Bandy has recently died. Daniel agrees on condition that Eli denounces his faith and his own credibility. Eli acquiesces, after which Daniel coldly reveals that the property is now worthless because Daniel's neighboring wells have already tapped and drained the same oil reservoir. Desperate, Eli confesses to having lost money in the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929|1929 stock market crash]] and having strayed morally. Daniel taunts Eli before chasing him around the bowling alley and beating him to death with a bowling pin. When his butler appears to ask about the commotion, Daniel announces, \"I'm finished.\"\n\n== Cast ==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Daniel Day-Lewis]] as Daniel Plainview\n* [[Paul Dano]] as Paul & Eli Sunday\n* [[Kevin J.

Although he had read Sinclair's book ''[[The Jungle]]'', he did not know about his other works or anything about Sinclair himself. He decided to read most of Sinclair's works, and eventually read the novel ''[[Oil!]]'', which he loved. Schlosser, who found the book to be exciting and thought it would make a great film, sought out the Sinclair estate and purchased the film rights. He thought that he would try to find a director who was as passionate about the book as he was, but director Paul Thomas Anderson approached him first.<ref name=\"ES-TNYT-2008\">{{cite news |author=Schlosser, Eric  |date=February 22, 2008 |title='Oil!' and the History of Southern California |newspaper=The New York Times}}</ref>\n\nAnderson had been working on a screenplay about two fighting families.

It was so cohesive, the way Upton Sinclair wrote about that period, and his experiences around the oil fields and these independent oilmen. That said, the book is so long that it's only the first couple hundred pages that we ended up using, because there is a certain point where he strays really far from what the original story is. We were really unfaithful to the book. That's not to say I didn't really like the book; I loved it. But there were so many other things floating around. And at a certain point, I became aware of the stuff he was basing it on. What he was writing about was the life of [oil barons] [[Edward L.

In a career defined by transcendent performances, Daniel Day-Lewis creates a character so rich and so towering, that \"Daniel Plainview\" will haunt the history of film for generations to come.<ref>[https://www.afi.com/tvevents/afiawards07/movies07.aspx \"AFI Movies of the Year Official Selections\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605081634/http://www.afi.com/tvevents/afiawards07/movies07.aspx |date=2011-06-05 }}.

Daniel Day-Lewis gave the best and ballsiest performance of the past 10 years. As Daniel Plainview, a prospector who loots the land of its natural resources in silver and oil to fill his pockets and gargantuan ego, he showed us a man draining his humanity for power. And Anderson, having extended Plainview's rage from Earth to heaven in the form of a corrupt preacher (Paul Dano), managed to \"drink the milkshake\" of other risk-taking directors. If I had to stake the future of film in the next decade on one filmmaker, I'd go with PTA. Even more than ''Boogie Nights'' and ''Magnolia''\u2014his rebel cries from the 1990s\u2014''Blood'' let Anderson put technology at the service of character. The score by Radiohead's Jonny Greenwood was a sonic explosion that reinvented what film music could be. And the images captured by Robert Elswit, a genius of camera and lighting, made visual poetry out of an oil well consumed by flame. For the final word on ''Blood'', I'll quote Plainview: \"It was one goddamn hell of a show.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/photos/gallery/31234572/peter_travers_10_best_movies_of_t/photo/10ml |title=Peter Travers' 10 Best Movies of the Decade |work=Rolling Stone Magazine |date=December 10, 2009 |access-date=December 10, 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100114150503/http://www.rollingstone.com/photos/gallery/31234572/peter_travers_10_best_movies_of_t/photo/10ml |archive-date=January 14, 2010 }}</ref></blockquote>\n\n''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' and ''[[At the Movies (1986 TV program)|At the Movies]]'' critic [[Michael Phillips (critic)|Michael Phillips]] named ''There Will Be Blood'' the decade's best film. Phillips stated:\n<blockquote>This most eccentric and haunting of modern epics is driven by oilman Daniel Plainview, who, in the hands of actor Daniel Day-Lewis, becomes a Horatio Alger story gone horribly wrong. Writer/director Paul Thomas Anderson's camera is as crucial to the film's hypnotic pull as the performance at its center. For its evocation of the early 1900s, its relentless focus on one man's fascinating obsessions, and for its inspiring example of how to freely adapt a novel\u2014plus, what I think is the performance of the new century\u2014''There Will Be Blood'' stands alone. The more I see it, the sadder, and stranger, and more visually astounding it grows\u2014and the more it seems to say about the best and worst in the American ethos of rugged individualism. Awfully good!<ref>{{cite web |url=http://bventertainment.go.com/tv/buenavista/atm/specials/bestofthedecade/index.html |title=Best of the Decade |date=December 28, 2009 |access-date=December 28, 2009}}{{dead link|date=November 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' critic Lisa Schwarzbaum named ''There Will Be Blood'' the decade's best film as well. In her original review, Schwarzbaum stated:\n<blockquote>Anyhow, a fierce story meshing big exterior-oriented themes of American character with an interior-oriented portrait of an impenetrable man (two men, really, including the false prophet Sunday) is only half Anderson's quest, and his exciting achievement. The other half lies in the innovation applied to the telling itself. For a huge picture, ''There Will Be Blood'' is exquisitely intimate, almost a collection of sketches. For a long, slow movie, it speeds. For a story set in the fabled bad-old-days past, it's got the terrors of modernity in its DNA. Leaps of romantic chordal grandeur from Brahms' Violin Concerto in D Major announce the launch of a fortune-changing oil well down the road from Eli Sunday's church\u2014and then, much later, announce a kind of end of the world. For bleakness, the movie can't be beat\u2014nor for brilliance.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20168259,00.html |title=There Will Be Blood Review |magazine=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |date=January 9, 2008 |access-date=January 9, 2008 |archive-date=January 7, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080107070307/http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20168259,00.html |url-status=live }}</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn December 2009, the website [[Gawker.com]] determined that ''There Will Be Blood'' is film critics' consensus best film of the decade when aggregating all Best of the Decade lists, stating: \"And when the votes were all in, by a nose, ''There Will Be Blood'' stood alone at the top of the decade, its straw in the whole damn cinema's milkshake.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=https://gawker.com/5428998/there-will-be-blood-wins-the-decade |title=There Will Be Blood Wins the Decade |work=Gawker |date=December 18, 2009 |access-date=February 7, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100203203506/http://gawker.com/5428998/there-will-be-blood-wins-the-decade |archive-date=February 3, 2010 }}</ref>\n\nThe list of critics who lauded ''There Will Be Blood'' in their assessments of films from the past decade include:\n\n{{Col-begin}}\n{{Col-2}}\n* ''[[The A.V.
