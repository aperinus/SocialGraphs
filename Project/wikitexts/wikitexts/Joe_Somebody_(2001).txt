The film stars [[Tim Allen]] as an ordinary man forced into violence by a workplace [[Bullying|bully]]. The film also stars [[Julie Bowen]], [[Kelly Lynch]], [[Greg Germann]], [[Hayden Panettiere]], [[Patrick Warburton]] and [[Jim Belushi]].\n\nScreenwriter John Scott Shepherd wrote the script based on his experiences working in [[advertising]]. Though originally offered to [[Jim Carrey]], the role of Joe Scheffer would eventually be taken by Allen. The film marked Allen and Pasquin's third feature together, after 1994's ''[[The Santa Clause]]''  and 1997's ''[[Jungle 2 Jungle]]''. The entire film was shot over a nearly eight-week span in [[Minnesota]].\n\nThe film was released in the U.S. on December 21, 2001, to mixed reviews. Produced on a $38 million budget, the film ended its theatrical run with $24.5 million worldwide, making it a financial failure. The film received one award nomination, which went to young Panettiere's performance as the title character's daughter.\n\n==Plot==\nJoe Scheffer is a recently [[divorce]]d [[single parent]], and a talented audio/visual specialist at STARKe Pharmaceuticals. One day Joe pulls into the parking lot at work to find his co-worker Mark McKinney  parking in a spot that has been reserved for those who have worked for the company for ten years. However, McKinney has only worked there for seven years. When Joe confronts McKinney about this, McKinney assaults him in front of his young daughter Natalie.\n\nJoe falls into a state of self-pity until Meg Harper, the Wellness Coordinator at STARKe, accidentally ignites a fuse in him when, in a fit of frustration, she asks Joe, \"What do you want?\" Joe is suddenly stirred to action by this question, and decides he wants a rematch to reclaim his dignity and self-respect, which he felt McKinney took from him.\n\nAfter issuing the challenge to McKinney, Joe begins to find himself becoming very popular around the office for his bravery. Meg and Natalie, however, do not feel fighting McKinney will solve anything, and both attempt to tell Joe as much, to no avail. Joe seeks out the aid of an ex [[B movie]] star-turned-[[martial arts]] instructor named Chuck Scarett to teach him to defend himself. Things seem to finally be going right for Joe, as he has begun to see Meg and has even been given a promotion at work he had been hoping for. When Meg realizes Jeremy, a colleague she works closely with for the company (who also happens to be attracted to her), only gave Joe a non-existing position at the office to prevent him from suing the company, she resigns in fear that she might one day have to demote or even fire Joe. Meg again tries to persuade Joe not to fight McKinney, and finally gives him an ultimatum: if he does not call off the fight with McKinney, their relationship is over.\n\nThe day of the fight, Joe makes it all the way to the school where the brawl is to take place. However, he finally realizes it would be immature to fight, and not worth the price he would have to pay. When Joe tells McKinney and his other co-workers the fight is off, McKinney offers him an apology, which Joe accepts. Joe then goes and makes up with Meg for not understanding her reasoning before.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Tim Allen]] as Joe Scheffer, Natalie's father and the film's main [[protagonist]].\n* [[Julie Bowen]] as Meg Harper, the Wellness Coordinator at STARKe Pharmaceuticals, and Joe's romantic interest.\n* [[Kelly Lynch]] as Callie Scheffer, Joe's ex-wife and Natalie's mother.\n* [[Greg Germann]] as Jeremy, an executive at STARKe Pharmaceuticals, who is also romantically interested in Meg.\n* [[Hayden Panettiere]] as Natalie Scheffer, Joe and Callie's daughter.\n* [[Patrick Warburton]] as Mark McKinney, an employee at STARKe Pharmaceuticals and the film's main [[antagonist]].\n* [[Jim Belushi]] as Chuck Scarett, Joe's [[martial arts]] instructor and personal [[confidant]].\n* [[Ken Marino]] as Rick Raglow, Callie's boyfriend.\n* [[Wolfgang Bodison]] as Cade Raymond, a co-worker who befriends Joe after he decides to take on McKinney.\n* [[Cristi Conaway]] as Abby Manheim, one of Joe's co-workers at STARKe Pharmaceuticals.\n* [[Robert Joy]] as Pat Chilcutt, the head of Joe's department at STARKe Pharmaceuticals.\n* [[Tina Lifford]] as Cassandra Taylor, a counselor at Natalie's school.\n* [[Jesse Ventura]] as Himself\n\n==Production==\n\n===Development===\nJohn Scott Shepherd, who wrote the film's script, had previous experience in [[advertising]] as a [[Film producer|film]] and [[Video production|video producer]]. Shepherd was inspired to write a screenplay about those experiences and the people who have to work behind the scenes in corporate America. \"It occurred to me that we all expect to be special, if not famous,\" recalled Shepherd.<ref name=\"CnmaPrdctnNts\">{{cite news|url=http://www.cinema.com/articles/690/joe-somebody-production-notes.phtml|title=Joe Somebody: Production Notes|accessdate=April 12, 2009|work=Cinema.com}}</ref> The screenplay caught the attention of Kopelson Entertainment executive Matthew Gross, who first read the script while working on a [[television pilot]] with Shepherd.
