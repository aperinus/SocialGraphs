O is taught to be constantly available for oral, vaginal, and anal intercourse. She is regularly [[Sexual bondage|stripped, blindfolded, chained and whipped]]. She leaves Roissy wearing an iron ring as a sign of her initiation and indicator to men in the society that she is a sex slave.\n\nO meets a vain model named Jacqueline, whom she photographs and grows enamored with. Ren\u00e9 introduces O to his much older step-brother, Sir Stephen, and the two men share O, as Ren\u00e9 wishes O to learn to obey and serve someone whom she does not love. While Sir Stephen proves to be a more severe and strict master than Ren\u00e9, O soon believes he is in love with her.\n\nAt Sir Stephen's direction, O is sent to an all-female country house in Samois, run by a woman named Anne-Marie, where she undergoes further beatings and training in submission. O's visit concludes with having rings pierced into her labia at the request of Sir Stephen, and receiving a brand with his initials.\n\nSir Stephen tells O that Ren\u00e9 is in love with Jacqueline, and that O must seduce her and get her to undergo training at Roissy. While at first resistant to getting Jacqueline to go to Roissy, O eventually agrees. Jacqueline moves into O's flat, and is seduced by her. O reveals her BDSM lifestyle and describes her stay at Roissy to Jacqueline, who is initially repulsed and disbelieving.\n\nSir Stephen shares O with two other men of his acquaintance, one simply known as \"the commander\" and the other a young man named Ivan. After one sexual encounter with O, Ivan believes himself to be in love with her and requests Sir Stephen release her. However O refuses to leave Sir Stephen.\n\nO takes Jacqueline to Roissy where she will be trained to serve Ren\u00e9. Later Sir Stephen and O visit the commander's home in Brittany for a party, where O is treated as a visual spectacle, wearing nothing but chains and an owl mask. Watching O at the party, Sir Stephen feels that his ownership of her is complete.\n\nSome time after that, O asks Sir Stephen if he would endure the same punishments and experiences that she has undergone to show her unconditional love for him. When he says \"I suppose so\", she suddenly burns his hand with a hot cigarette holder, leaving there a circle, or an O.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Corinne Cl\u00e9ry]] as O\n* [[Udo Kier]] as Ren\u00e9\n* [[Anthony Steel (actor)|Anthony Steel]] as Sir Stephen\n* [[Jean Gaven]] as Pierre\n* Li Sellgren as Jacqueline\n* Albane Navizet as Andree\n* [[Christiane Minazzoli]] as Anne-Marie\n* [[Alain Noury]] as Ivan\n* {{ill|Martine Kelly|fr}} as Therese\n* {{ill|Jean-Pierre Andr\u00e9ani|fr}} as Eric, ma\u00eetre\n* [[Gabriel Cattand]] as The commander\n* {{ill|Henri Pi\u00e9gay|fr}} as Ma\u00eetre\n* {{ill|Florence Cayrol|fr}} as Yvonne\n}}\n\n==Production==\n''Story of O'' was the first in a series of sex-oriented films for Anthony Steel, although he was always clothed.<ref name=\"vagg\">{{cite magazine|magazine=Filmink|first=Stephen|last=Vagg|url=https://www.filmink.com.au/the-emasculation-of-anthony-steel-a-cold-streak-saga/|title=The Emasculation of Anthony Steel: A Cold Streak Saga|date=23 September 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\nThe film was refused a UK theatrical release certificate from the [[BBFC]] in 1975,<ref name=bbfc /><ref>Our Arts Reporter. \"Ban on a controversial French film by GLC\".
