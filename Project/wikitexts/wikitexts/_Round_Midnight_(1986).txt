While the film is fictionalized, it is drawn directly from the memoir/biography ''Dance of the Infidels'' written by French author Francis Paudras, who had befriended Powell during his Paris expatriate days and on whom the character Francis was based. The film is a wistful and tragic portrait that captures the Paris jazz scene of the 1950s.<ref>{{cite web|last=KOENIGSBERG|first=LARRY|title=Book Reviews|url=http://www.allaboutjazz.com/php/article.php?id=1335#.U1GSdj_3HTg|work=Dance of the Infidels: A Portrait of Bud Powell|publisher=All About Jazz|access-date=18 April 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Ratliff|first=Ben|title=Francis Paudras, 62, Patron Of Jazz Pianist Bud Powell|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/12/17/arts/francis-paudras-62-patron-of-jazz-pianist-bud-powell.html|access-date=18 April 2014|newspaper=New York Times|date=December 17, 1997}}</ref>\n\nGordon was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Actor]] and won a Grammy for the film's soundtrack entitled ''The Other Side of Round Midnight'' in the category for Best Instrumental Jazz Performance, Soloist. Hancock won the [[Academy Award for Best Original Score]]. The soundtrack was released in two parts: ''[[Round Midnight (Soundtrack)|Round Midnight]]'' and ''[[The Other Side of Round Midnight]]''.\n\n==Synopsis==\nIn 1950s New York, Dale Turner is an accomplished saxophone player barely getting by playing at local jazz clubs and struggling with substance abuse, particularly of alcohol. After talking with a fellow musician who is currently disabled by illness, Dale decides to try to improve his life by traveling to Paris and making a living playing at {{ill|Le Blue Note|fr|Blue Note (Paris)}} jazz club until his luck gets better.\n\nTurner arrives in Paris and is befriended by Francis, a struggling French graphic designer specializing in film posters and who lives with his daughter, his marriage having broken up. He idolizes the musician and tries desperately to help him escape alcohol abuse. With time, and after Francis allows Turner to move in with him and his daughter, Turner manages to put himself on his own feet again and starts to get by without a reliance on alcohol. He eventually decides it is time to go home to New York to see his old friends and to re-acquaint himself with his own daughter.\n\nFrancis accompanies Dale, and the music community in New York is ready to accept the musician back. He writes a song dedicated to his daughter in the hope of strengthening their relationship after much time apart. He invites her to the club to hear its debut, but manages to confuse her true age and tells the audience she has just turned 15; she is actually 14, and she makes note of this to Francis, who is seated next to her in the audience. Later in the week, when Dale tries to further his bond with her by sharing a meal at a local diner, an old drug dealer recognizes him there, re-introduces himself and implies his supplies are still available to Dale.\n\nFrancis tries to intervene a few times to keep Dale protected from his old suppliers, and attempts to keep up with all of them. When Francis eventually leaves and returns to Paris and his daughter, he receives a telegram from Dale's music manager saying that the musician has died in a local hospital.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Dexter Gordon]] as Dale Turner\n* [[Fran\u00e7ois Cluzet]] as Francis Borler\n* Gabrielle Haker as Berangere\n* [[Sandra Reaves-Phillips]] as \"Buttercup\"\n* [[Lonette McKee]] as Darcey Leigh\n* [[Christine Pascal]] as Sylvie\n* [[Herbie Hancock]] as Eddie Wayne\n* [[Bobby Hutcherson]] as \"Ace\"\n* [[Liliane Rov\u00e8re]] as [[Stephanie St. Clair|Madame Queen]]\n* [[Pierre Trabaud]] as Francis's Father\n* Fr\u00e9d\u00e9rique Meininger as Francis's Mother\n* Hart Leroy Bibbs as Hershell\n* Ged Marlon as Beau\n* [[Beno\u00eet R\u00e9gent]] as Psychiatrist\n* [[Victoria Platt|Victoria Gabrielle Platt]] as Chan Turner\n* [[Arthur French (actor)|Arthur French]] as Booker\n* [[John Berry (film director)|John Berry]] as Ben\n* [[Martin Scorsese]] as Goodley\n* [[Philippe Noiret]] as Redon\n* [[Alain Sarde]] as Terzian\n* [[Eddy Mitchell]] as L'ivrogne Au Bar Du Blue Note\n* [[Billy Higgins]] as Drums (Blue Note, Davout Studio)\n* \u00c9ric Le Lann as Trumpet (Blue Note)\n* [[John McLaughlin (musician)|John McLaughlin]] as Guitar (Blue Note)\n* [[Pierre Michelot]] as Bass (Blue Note)\n* [[Wayne Shorter]] as Tenor Saxophone (Blue Note), Soprano Saxophone (Davout Studio, Lyon)\n* [[Ron Carter]] as Bass (Davout Studio, New York)\n* [[Palle Mikkelborg]] as Trumpet (Davout Studio)\n* [[Mads Vinding]] as Bass (Davout Studio, Lyon)\n* [[Cheikh Fall]] as Percussion (Lyon)\n* Michel P\u00e9rez as Guitar (Lyon)\n* [[Tony Williams (drummer)|Tony Williams]] as Drums (Lyon, New York)\n* [[Freddie Hubbard]] as Trumpet (New York)\n* [[Cedar Walton]] as Piano (New York)\n}}\n\n==Production==\n''Round Midnight'' was filmed in Paris and New York City. It was produced by [[Irwin Winkler]].\n\nTavernier defied the film studio by insisting that real-life jazz tenor saxophonist [[Dexter Gordon]] play the role of Turner. Gordon, who himself played with Bud Powell in Paris in the early 1960s (and earlier in their careers), helped to revise and rewrite the script. The supporting cast is likewise composed of jazz musicians (mainly from the generation which followed Gordon and Powell) such as [[Herbie Hancock]], [[Bobby Hutcherson]], [[John McLaughlin (musician)|John McLaughlin]], and [[Wayne Shorter]], among others who perform the music throughout the film. The musicians are joined by actors Fran\u00e7ois Cluzet, Gabrielle Haker, Sandra Reaves-Phillips, [[Lonette McKee]], and [[Christine Pascal]].\n\n==Soundtrack==\n{{Main|Round Midnight (soundtrack)}}\nThe score for the film was composed by Hancock. The soundtrack was in two parts \u2013 ''[[Round Midnight (Soundtrack)|Round Midnight]]'' and ''[[The Other Side of Round Midnight]]'' \u2013 released under Dexter Gordon's name and featuring his last recordings, although he does not appear on all tracks. Both albums were produced and arranged by Hancock.\n\n==Reception==\n''Round Midnight'' received a 96% rating at [[Rotten Tomatoes]] from 23 reviews.\n\n==Accolades==\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n!
