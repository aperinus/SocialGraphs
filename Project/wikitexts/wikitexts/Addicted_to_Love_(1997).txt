Its title is based on [[Robert Palmer (singer)|Robert Palmer]]'s song \"[[Addicted to Love (song)|Addicted to Love]]\", a cover of which by [[Neneh Cherry]] is featured in the film.\n\n==Plot==\nThe story begins in a small town, where Sam works as an astronomer and enjoys an idyllic life with his childhood sweetheart Linda, who is a schoolteacher. She wants more experiences than can be offered in their small town, so goes to [[New York City]] for a two-month teaching fellowship.\n\nInstead of returning home, Linda sends Sam a [[Dear John letter]] announcing that she is staying in New York. He leaves almost immediately for the city, convinced he can get her back.\n\nSam quickly discovers Linda's living with a new lover, French restaurant owner Anton. Sam breaks into an abandoned building across from Anton's residence, and converts his astronomy equipment to surveillance equipment. He sets up house (and a [[camera obscura]]), watching her interactions with Anton in the hopes of finding out more information about them, as well as predicting when they will break up.\n\nSam's surveillance operation is later discovered by Maggie, a photographer and [[motorcyclist]], determined to get revenge on Anton, her ex-fiance. She sets up in a nearby room, and soon has sound equipment set up to eavesdrop on the couple.\n\nOut of money and to find out more about him, Sam takes a job at Anton's restaurant as a dishwasher. As the men talk they become friends, Anton unaware of Sam's connection to Linda. Partnering with Maggie in the hopes of driving them apart, a comedy of errors ensues, in which Maggie and Sam try several unethical and nasty tricks to break apart their respective former partners, including: identity theft, assault, embarrassing him in public with a street performer's monkey, paying children to spray him with women's perfume in the street, planting women's underwear and receipts for expensive gifts and getting Anton's restaurant shut down by bringing in cockroaches on a busy night with a food critic there.\n\nMutually hostile at first, Sam and Maggie eventually warm up to each other in their quest to break up Linda and Anton, complicating their original mission to win their former partners back. When Maggie's nan visits, she insists they kiss for a photo (she believes he is her fianc\u00e8), and they obviously share a moment. But suddenly they discover Linda has left Anton. He really had slept with another woman, someone in the bank to help with a loan.\n\nMaggie pushes Sam out, as Linda is now gone, and he runs into a desolate Anton, who talks him into joining him at his place. Maggie watches as they interact. The next day, she's there to spy on Sam when he sees and kisses Linda, and again spies on him that night as he helps a severely discapacitated Anton he unintentionally got put into an upper body cast. Sam mentions Linda, which makes Anton realise something  is fishy about Sam, and he attacks him.\n\nThe upshot of it all is, Maggie makes peace with Anton, Sam comes clean with Linda and in the closing there are two couples:  Sam and Maggie, Anton back with Linda.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast list|\n* [[Meg Ryan]] as Maggie\n* [[Matthew Broderick]] as Sam\n* [[Kelly Preston]] as Linda\n* [[Tch\u00e9ky Karyo]] as Anton\n* [[Maureen Stapleton]] as Nana\n* [[Remak Ramsay]] as Professor Wells\n* [[Lee Wilkof]] as Carl\n* [[Dominick Dunne]] as Matheson\n* [[Larry Pine]] as Street Comic\n* [[Daniel Dae Kim]] as Undergrad Assistant\n* [[Bill Timoney]] as Restaurant Patron\n}}\n\n==Reception==\n===Box office===\nThe film, marking actor Griffin Dunne's full-length directorial debut, was released on May 23, one week before the highly competitive [[Memorial Day]] weekend in the United States.{{citation needed|date=September 2019}}\n\nThe film opened at No. 2 at the North American box office making US$11.4&nbsp;million in its opening weekend, behind ''[[The Lost World: Jurassic Park]]''.<ref name=\"wordpress\">{{cite web|url=https://comedymoviesreview.wordpress.com/|title=Comedy Movie Reviews &#124; latest and classic comedies in review|website=comedymoviesreview.wordpress.com|accessdate=September 6, 2017}}</ref>{{Failed verification|date=April 2020}}\n\nThe film only managed to gross $34,673,095 at the box office,<ref name=\"NUM\">{{cite web | url = http://www.the-numbers.com/movies/1997/ADDIC.html | title = ''Addicted to Love'' performance | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20030821122601/http://www.the-numbers.com/movies/1997/ADDIC.html |archive-date=August 21, 2003 |work= The-Numbers.com }}</ref> several million less than either Ryan<ref>[http://www.the-numbers.com/people/MRYAN.html Meg Ryan performance] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030825070518/http://www.the-numbers.com/people/MRYAN.html |date=August 25, 2003 }} from The-Numbers.com</ref> or Broderick's averages.<ref>[http://www.the-numbers.com/people/MBROD.html Matthew Broderick's performance] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030803152254/http://www.the-numbers.com/people/MBROD.html |date=August 3, 2003 }} from The-Numbers.com</ref>\n\n===Critical response===\nOn [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film has an approval rating of 55% based on reviews from 33 critics.<ref>{{cite web |title= Addicted to Love (1997) |url= https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/addicted_to_love |website= [[Rotten Tomatoes]] |access-date= April 10, 2020 }}</ref> On [[Metacritic]], it has a score of 49 out of 100 based on reviews from 19 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".<ref>{{cite web |title= Addicted to Love |url= https://www.metacritic.com/movie/addicted-to-love |website= [[Metacritic]] |access-date= April 10, 2020 }}</ref> Audiences surveyed by [[CinemaScore]] gave the film a grade B on scale of A to F.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.cinemascore.com/publicsearch/index/title/ |title= ADDICTED TO LOVE (1997) B |work= [[CinemaScore]] |url-status= dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20181220122629/https://www.cinemascore.com/publicsearch/index/title/ |archive-date= December 20, 2018 }}</ref>\n\n''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' film critic [[Roger Ebert]] panned it as immature, implausible and imbecilic, giving it two stars out of a possible four.<ref name=\"suntimes\">{{cite web |date= May 23, 1997 |first= Roger |last= Ebert |author-link= Roger Ebert |url= https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/addicted-to-love-1997 |title= Addicted to Love Movie Review (1997) |website= [[Chicago Sun-Times]]|via=[[RogerEbert.com]]|accessdate=September 6, 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''<nowiki>'</nowiki> Kevin Thomas called the film \"creepy\", writing:\n\n{{cquote|It is exceedingly difficult to find what's funny in the calculated, obsessive, relentless destruction of Anton, especially when he proves to be the most likable and mature of all four of these people.
