The tribe is led by a hunter who has killed a mammoth single-handedly and earned the White Spear, and venerate Old Mother, an elderly woman with shamanistic powers. The mammoths begin to dwindle, and the village chief finds a young girl named Evolet who survived a massacre of her village, perpetrated by what Old Mother calls \"four-legged demons\" who will come when \"the Yagahl go on their last hunt\". She prophesies that whoever kills the leader of the \"demons\" will win both Evolet and the White Spear, becoming the next village chief. The tribe believe that the \"demons\" are mammoths, whose return will save them from starvation. The chief, however, does not believe the prophecy and leaves to find another way to save his people. He entrusts the White Spear, his son D'Leh, and the true purpose of his quest to his friend Tic'Tic. The rest of the tribe, including D'Leh's rival Ka'Ren, believe that D'Leh's father was a coward and fled. Over time, D'Leh and Evolet fall in love.\n\nWhen the mammoths finally return, D'Leh hunts them with the men of the tribe under Tic'Tic's leadership and manages to kill one by accident, inadvertently winning both the White Spear and marriage to Evolet. The village believes Old Mother's prophecy is coming true, but D'Leh is consumed by guilt for not earning the White Spear fairly. After speaking with Tic'Tic, he gives up the White Spear, forfeiting his marriage to Evolet. The next day, horse-raiders attack the camp, enslaving Evolet and several others and killing many of the tribe. D'Leh, Tic'Tic, Ka'Ren, and young boy Baku set out to rescue their fellow Yagahl, but Evolet is recaptured with Ka'Ren and Baku during an attack on the slavers by [[Phorusrhacidae|terror birds]], and Tic'Tic is wounded. While hunting, D'Leh falls into a pit, where he rescues a ''[[Smilodon]]'' ([[saber-toothed cat|saber-toothed tiger]]) before escaping himself. After Tic'Tic recovers, they make their way to a village of [[Agrarian society|sedentary farmers]] and learn of a prophecy from the Naku, another tribe; whoever talks to a Smilodon they call the \"Spear-Tooth\" will help free their people. D'Leh realizes the prophecy is about him when the Smilodon he rescued arrives and refuses to kill him. They also learn that D'Leh's father was a guest of the Naku until the slavers captured him. Tic'Tic finally reveals to D'Leh that his father did not abandon the tribe. Rather he set out to save it, but let the others believe he had fled to prevent them from following him.\n\nSeveral tribes form a coalition to pursue the raiders with D'Leh as their leader. They find the ships holding Evolet and their families but fail to reach them before the raiders cast off. The war party nearly dies out while journeying through a treacherous desert, but D'leh learns to use the [[Polaris|North Star]] to navigate the dunes. On the other side of the desert, they discover an advanced civilization, ruled by an enigmatic [[god-king]] known as the \"Almighty\". Here it is discovered that the kidnapped Yagahl are used as slave labor to build a pyramid. The warlord who kidnapped Evolet tries unsuccessfully to win her love, only to be arrested by the Almighty's priests when they find he has taken her without permission. During a night scouting raid, D'Leh learns of the Almighty and the fate of his father, who perished as a slave. The party is spotted by the guards, who are killed by Tic'Tic before he succumbs to his wounds. Meanwhile, the Almighty's priests believe that Evolet is destined to kill The Almighty, based on the whip scars on her hands matching the stars they call the \"Mark of the Hunter\" and an ancient prophecy foreseeing their civilization's downfall. The Almighty deduces that Evolet is merely the herald of the true Hunter, which leaves him and his priests unsettled. D'Leh starts a rebellion among the slaves, killing many of the Almighty's forces, though Ka'Ren is killed.\n\nThe Almighty offers Evolet and the other hunters to D'Leh in exchange for abandoning his rebellion. D'Leh feigns acceptance but kills the Almighty with a spear, breaking his illusion of godhood. During the ensuing battle, Evolet is killed by the warlord who is then killed by D'Leh, but is restored to life when Old Mother sacrifices herself. With the Almighty dead and his civilization destroyed, the Yagahl bid farewell to the other tribes and return home with seeds given to them by the Naku to start a new life.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n*[[Steven Strait]] as D'Leh, a mammoth hunter.\n*[[Camilla Belle]] as Evolet, D'Leh's wife and the only survivor of a tribe which was killed off by the \"four-legged demons\" (fierce warriors on horseback); she was spared because of her blue eyes, which marked her as unique.\n*[[Cliff Curtis]] as Tic'Tic, D'Leh's mentor and friend.<ref>{{cite news | author=Shawn Adler | url=http://moviesblog.mtv.com/2007/06/29/emmerich-heads-back-in-time-for-10000-bc/ | title=Emmerich Heads Back In Time For '10000 B.C.' |publisher=MTV | date=June 29, 2007 | access-date=July 11, 2007 | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20070702164347/http://moviesblog.mtv.com/2007/06/29/emmerich-heads-back-in-time-for-10000-bc/| archive-date= July 2, 2007 <!--Added by DASHBot-->}}</ref>\n*Joel Virgel as Nakudu, leader of the Naku tribe.\n*[[Affif Ben Badra]] as Warlord, the leader of the \"Four Legged Demons\".\n*Mo Zinal as Ka'Ren.\n*Nathanael Baring as Baku.\n*[[Marco Khan]] as One-Eye, Warlord's main henchman.\n*[[Mona Hammond]] as Old Mother, the Yagahl wise old woman.\n*[[Joel Fry (actor)|Joel Fry]] as Lu'Kibu\n*[[Reece Ritchie]] as Moha.\n*Piers Stubbs as Young Moha.\n*Junior Oliphant as Tudu, Nakudu's son.\n*Kristian Beazley as D'Leh's father, who had lived with the Naku tribe and learned agriculture from them.\n*Boubacar Babiane as Quina, leader of another tribe.\n*Farouk Valley-Omar as the High Priest.\n*[[Tim Barlow]] as The Almighty, a tall, blue-eyed man who dresses in long white robes and a face-concealing veil.
