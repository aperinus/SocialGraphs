The film stars [[Jodie Foster]] and [[Kristen Stewart]] as a mother and daughter whose new home is invaded by burglars, played by [[Forest Whitaker]], [[Jared Leto]], and [[Dwight Yoakam]]. The script was written by [[David Koepp]], whose screenplay was inspired by news coverage in 2000 about [[safe room|panic rooms]].\n\nThe film was Fincher's fifth feature film, following ''[[Fight Club]]'' (1999). Fincher and Koepp brought together a crew of people with whom each had worked before. The house and its panic room were built on a [[Raleigh Studios]] lot. [[Nicole Kidman]] was originally cast as the mother, but she left after aggravating a previous injury. Her departure threatened the completion of the film, but Foster quickly replaced Kidman. The filmmakers used computer-generated imagery to create the illusion of the film camera moving through the house's rooms. Foster became pregnant during the shooting schedule, so filming was suspended until after she gave birth. The film's production cost {{nowrap|$48 million}}.\n\nThe film was commercially released in the United States and Canada on {{nowrap|March 29}}, 2002. The film grossed {{nowrap|$30 million}} on its opening weekend. In the United States and Canada, it grossed {{nowrap|$96.4 million}}. In other territories, it grossed {{nowrap|$100.7 million}} for a worldwide total of {{nowrap|$197.1 million}}. The film was well-received by critics, who praised Foster's performance and the film's suspense. ''Panic Room'' has been assessed for its portrayal of childhood and [[feminism]], the elements of [[video surveillance]] and [[diabetes]], and its thematic approach to [[death|mortality]].\n\n==Plot==\nRecently divorced Meg Altman and her eleven-year-old daughter, Sarah, move into a four-story [[brownstone]] in New York City's [[Upper West Side]]. The house's previous owner, a reclusive millionaire, installed a \"[[safe room|panic room]]\" to protect the occupants from intruders. The room is reinforced by concrete and steel on all sides and a thick steel door. There is also an extensive security system with multiple [[surveillance cameras]] and a [[public address system]].\n\nOn Meg and Sarah's first night, three men break into the home: Junior, the previous owner's grandson; Burnham, an employee of the home's security company; and Raoul, a thug Junior has recruited. They intend to steal [[bearer bond]]s locked inside a floor safe inside the panic room by the previous owners, as Junior doesn't want to share them with his extended family when his grandfather's estate is settled in [[probate]].\n\nWhen Meg awakes during the night to use the bathroom, she sees the men on the security cameras, and she and Sarah rush to the panic room. To force them out, the men pump propane gas into the room's air vents. Meg ignites the gas while she and Sarah cover themselves with fireproof blankets; the ignited propane leaves Junior badly burned. Meg taps into the main telephone line and calls her ex-husband, Stephen. As she attempts to explain their situation, the intruders cut the line, abruptly ending the call.\n\nWhen all attempts to breach the room fail, Junior gives up on the robbery, while letting slip that there is more money in the safe than he initially disclosed. When he attempts to leave, Raoul fatally shoots him then forces Burnham to continue with the robbery. Stephen arrives and is immediately taken hostage. Raoul severely beats him, making sure Meg sees it on the security camera. Sarah, a [[diabetes|diabetic]], then suffers a seizure as her [[glucagon]] syringes are in her bedroom.\n\nRaoul tricks Meg into thinking it is safe to temporarily leave the panic room and, when she leaves to retrieve Sarah's medication, the men enter the room with Sarah inside. Meg manages to throw the med kit in just as Burnham closes the door, inadvertently crushing Raoul's hand. She pleads with the men to give Sarah her medication, which Burnham does. Two policemen later arrive at the house following up on Stephen's earlier 911 call and complaints from the neighbors. To protect Sarah, Meg convinces the officers everything is fine and they leave. Meanwhile, Burnham opens the safe and finds $22&nbsp;million in bearer bonds inside.\n\nAs the men prepare to leave using Sarah as a hostage, Meg leads them into an ambush where she uses a sledgehammer to knock Raoul over a banister and into a stairwell. As Burnham flees, the injured Raoul crawls back up and overpowers Meg, preparing to bludgeon her with the sledgehammer. Burnham, hearing Sarah's terrified screams, rushes back and shoots Raoul, killing him. The police, alerted by Meg's earlier odd behavior, arrive back at the house in force and apprehend Burnham, who is forced to drop the bearer bonds, which scatter in the wind.\n\nA few days later, Meg and Sarah search the newspaper for a new, smaller home, having recovered from their harrowing ordeal.\n\n==Cast==\n{| class=\"infobox\" style=\"font-size:100%;\"\n|-\n!

[[Nicole Kidman]] was originally cast as Meg,<ref name=\"swallow150\" /> but she left the project due to a knee injury.<ref name=\"swallow152\" /> Foster, who almost joined the cast of Fincher's 1997 film ''[[The Game (1997 film)|The Game]]'', replaced Kidman. Fincher said Kidman's portrayal was \"about glamour and physicality\", while Foster's portrayal was \"more political\". Meg was originally written to be helpless, but with Foster's involvement, the character was revised to be stronger.<ref name=\"swallow153\" /> The casting change also led to Meg's being rewritten to be similar to her daughter, whereas Meg had been different from her before.<ref name=\"swallow153\" /> Foster became pregnant soon after she started filming. She told the filmmakers, and they decided to keep filming her scenes but with a wardrobe that would conceal her pregnancy.<ref name=\"swallow154\" /> Studio executives did not like the [[dailies]] and suspended production until Foster gave birth and returned to perform re-shoots.<ref name=\"swallow156\" /> Foster was reportedly paid {{nowrap|$12 million}} for her role.<ref name=\"swallow153\" />\n\n[[Kristen Stewart]] stars as Sarah, Meg's diabetic daughter. [[Hayden Panettiere]] was originally cast as Sarah,<ref name=\"swallow150\" /> but when she left the project toward the end of 2000, Stewart was cast in the role.<ref name=\"swallow151\" /> ''Panic Room'' was Stewart's second feature film after ''[[The Safety of Objects]]'' (2001).<ref name=\"swallow161\" /> When Kidman was cast as Meg, Fincher said Stewart was \"to complement [Kidman's portrayal], to be her antithesis, tomboyish, androgynous, dismissive, a teenager at ten years old. It was about the daughter being a parent to her mother.\"<ref name=\"swallow151\" /> When Foster replaced Kidman, the character Meg was rewritten so she and Sarah would be similar.<ref name=\"swallow153\" />\n\n[[Forest Whitaker]], [[Jared Leto]], and [[Dwight Yoakam]] star as the film's burglars, Burnham, Junior, and Raoul, respectively. Whitaker's character Burnham was originally written to be \"a slick, technical type\" and the designer of the panic room in Meg and Sarah's home. Fincher did not think a designer could be persuaded to break into a home, so he rewrote the character to be a [[blue-collar worker]] who installs panic rooms for a living. The director told Whitaker to watch ''[[Key Largo (film)|Key Largo]]'' (1948) and to emulate [[Humphrey Bogart]]'s character. Whitaker said he liked Burnham's \"conflicted\" nature and preferred it to Raoul's villainy.<ref name=\"swallow162\" /> Raoul was originally written to be \"a giant scary hulking guy\", but Fincher rewrote him to be \"this wiry, mean kind of ex-con white trash guy\".<ref name=\"swallow150\" /> In one revised instance, Raoul punches Meg instead of slapping her to be reinforced as \"an appalling character\".<ref name=\"swallow168\" /> The role of Raoul was originally offered to [[Maynard James Keenan]], whom Fincher had directed in a music video for [[A Perfect Circle]]'s \"[[Judith (A Perfect Circle song)|Judith]]\". Keenan was too busy as the lead singer for [[Tool (band)|Tool]],<ref name=\"swallow150\" /> so Fincher then offered the role to Yoakam, knowing him from his performance in ''[[Sling Blade]]'' (1996). For the role of Junior, Fincher cast Leto, who was in the cast of Fincher's previous film ''Fight Club'' (1999).<ref name=\"swallow162\" /> As part of atypical class division, Junior is \"the uptown rich kid\", where Burnham is blue-collar, and Raoul is undefinable.<ref name=\"swallow167\" />\n\nPatrick Bauchau had a minor role as Meg's ex-husband Stephen. Kidman, though she left the primary role due to her knee injury, had an uncredited off-screen role as the voice of Stephen's supermodel girlfriend.<ref name=\"swallow154\" /> Screenwriter [[Andrew Kevin Walker]], who was a credited writer for ''[[Seven (1995 film)|Seven]]'' and ''The Game'' and an uncredited writer for ''Fight Club'', had a cameo in ''Panic Room'' as a sleepy neighbor.<ref name=\"swallow163\" />\n\n==Production==\n[[File:David Fincher (2012) 3.jpg|upright|thumb|right|Director David Fincher]]\n{{Div col}}\n* [[David Fincher]] \u2013 director<ref name=\"swallow146\" />\n* [[David Koepp]] \u2013 screenwriter, producer<ref name=\"swallow146\" />\n* [[Ce\u00e1n Chaffin]] \u2013 producer<ref name=\"swallow146\" />\n* Judy Hofflund \u2013 producer<ref name=\"swallow146\" />\n* [[Gavin Polone]] \u2013 producer<ref name=\"swallow146\" />\n* [[Howard Shore]] \u2013 composer<ref name=\"swallow146\" />\n* [[Conrad W.

Fincher included as producer Ce\u00e1n Chaffin, with whom he had worked on commercials and music videos. Fincher also included in his initial crew people with whom he had worked before: cinematographer Darius Khondji, production designer Arthur Max, costume designer Michael Kaplan, and editors James Haygood and Angus Wall.<ref name=\"swallow149\" />\n\nFincher envisioned ''Panic Room'' as a [[wikt:popcorn movie|popcorn movie]] about survival. His previous film ''Fight Club'' had 400 scenes and 100 locations, so he wanted to simplify the production of ''Panic Room''.<ref name=\"swallow148\" /> To this end, he wanted to focus production on a single set and to plan the scenes and shots thoroughly before the start of filming. Despite the preparation, he experienced difficulty in production with changes in the cast and the crew as well as the inherent inflexibility of his initial planning.<ref name=\"swallow145\" />\n\n===Development===\nScreenwriter David Koepp was inspired by news coverage in 2000 about how [[safe room]]s were becoming prevalent among the wealthy living in urban areas. He sold the script to [[Sony Pictures]] for {{nowrap|$4 million}}.<ref name=\"swallow150\" /> Before Fincher's involvement, director [[Ridley Scott]] was briefly connected to the project,<ref name=\"swallow149\" /> and actor-director [[Forest Whitaker]] studied the script before declining the opportunity to direct.<ref name=\"swallow150\" /> Fincher said he was interested in the script's omniscience and that he was reminded of \"the specific subjectivity\" of ''[[Rear Window]]'' (1954).<ref name=\"swallow149\" /> He also saw ''Panic Room'' as a cross between ''Rear Window'' and ''[[Straw Dogs (1971 film)|Straw Dogs]]'' (1971), though he was concerned \"a modern audience\" would compare ''Panic Room'' more to ''[[Home Alone]]'' (1990) than to ''Rear Window''.<ref name=\"swallow168\u2013169\" />\n\nFincher also saw ''Panic Room'' as a crime thriller similar to ''[[The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (film)|The Treasure of the Sierra Madre]]'' (1948), where money is \"an object that everyone's after for the wrong reasons\".<ref name=\"swallow150\" /> The director was also interested in the story's conciseness of happening in one place and in one night,<ref name=\"swallow150\" /> and how the screenplay was well-laid out to let the director decide a variety of shots and use of set-pieces.<ref name=\"swallow159\" /> Fincher also saw the project as a way to be \"in lock-step with the audience\" in a change of pace from his previous films.<ref name=\"swallow149\u2013150\" />\n\nKoepp's screenplay emphasized pace over exposition. Koepp and Fincher agreed to streamline the film so the opening would introduce the characters as soon as possible. Fincher also sought to lay out the film so audiences could see characters make plans and thus be ahead of them, calling the tense foresight \"a very cinematic notion\".<ref name=\"swallow166\" /> He wanted to track the different characters' agendas and to also keep scenes chronological, so he set up \"computer-generated motion-control shots\" to move the camera around the set. He planned scenes in which parallel scenes could be seen through the panic room's video monitors and also intercut between different characters.<ref name=\"swallow166\u2013167\" /> The final screenplay was similar in outline to the original one; there were minor changes in dialogue and specific moments, especially in the interaction between Meg and Sarah Altman due to Foster replacing Kidman.<ref name=\"swallow169\" /> Explicit mention of Sarah's diabetes, such as the emergency syringe containing [[glucagon]], were removed from the dialogue. Careful beverage intake, refrigerated medicine bottles, and Sarah's [[glucometer]] watch were intended as evidence of her diabetes.<ref name=\"swallow169\u2013170\" />\n\n===Pre-production===\nThe house was built on a soundstage on a [[Raleigh Studios]] lot. The set was designed by production designer Arthur Max,<ref name=\"swallow158\" /> and it cost {{nowrap|$6 million}} to build.<ref name=\"swallow156\" /> The panic room was {{convert|6|ft|m}} by {{convert|14|ft|m}}. Three versions of the room were built so Fincher could film scenes from multiple angles.<ref name=\"swallow159\" /> A 3D computer model of the set on the soundstage was designed. Fincher, who had done pre-visualization for ''Fight Club'', used the model to design shots and decide their sequence.<ref name=\"swallow151\" /> The computer model also enabled the camera to have \"total freedom to travel\" inside the house. Fincher said, \"What we were just trying to do with CG was to say, there's no camera operator, there's no crew, there's no track, and the camera can go everywhere.\"<ref name=\"swallow158\" /> The crew applied [[photogrammetry]]\u2014\"mapping still images over the surface of computer-generated 'sets'\".<ref name=\"swallow163\" /> The filming schedule was also shortened since camera setups could be evaluated and discarded virtually. Fincher had two-thirds of ''Panic Room''{{'}}s shots planned before the start of filming. Director [[Steven Soderbergh]] reviewed Fincher's test footage and warned him that excessive planning would make actual production difficult for him and his crew.<ref name=\"swallow151\" />\n\nFincher sought to light his film less than most other films; he believed darkness contributed to the scare factor. Entering production, he initially planned to film the first half of the film in near-total darkness but decided that it required too much patience from audiences. Instead, he chose a \"shadowy ambience\" as a backdrop for Meg and Sarah Altman.<ref name=\"swallow163\" />\n\n===Filming===\n[[File:Jodie Foster C\u00e9sars 2011 2 (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Jodie Foster]] was cast in the lead role after original star [[Nicole Kidman]] exited due to injury. Foster learned she was pregnant five weeks into filming her scenes.]]\nCasting began in 2000, with [[Nicole Kidman]] and [[Hayden Panettiere]] cast as Meg and Sarah Altman, the film's mother and daughter. [[Forest Whitaker]], [[Jared Leto]], and [[Dwight Yoakam]] were also cast as the film's burglars.<ref name=\"swallow150\" /> In December 2000, before the start of filming, Panettiere left the project, and was replaced by [[Kristen Stewart]].<ref name=\"abcnews.go.com\">{{Cite web |url=https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/story?id=110382 |title=Kidman Injury Jars Panic Shoot |publisher=[[ABC News]] |access-date=June 28, 2020 |date=January 6, 2006 |archive-date=August 15, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180815024250/https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/story?id=110382 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=\"swallow151\" /> Filming began in January 2001.<ref name=\"swallow152\" /> Shortly after the start of filming, cinematographer [[Darius Khondji]] was fired from the film. Khondji said he was fired after a conflict with a crew member that he did not want to name, but David Fincher said he and Khondji could not agree \"on aspects of production\".<ref name=\"swallow156\" /> Much of the film was already planned in pre-production, and Khondji could not be given flexibility. Fincher replaced Khondji with [[Conrad W. Hall]], with whom he found \"a balance\".<ref name=\"swallow157\" /> Khondji said he supported Hall as his replacement.<ref name=\"swallow156\" />\n\nAfter two weeks of filming, at the end of January 2001, Kidman was injured on set. An x-ray revealed a hairline fracture underneath one of her knee joints. The fracture was an injury from Kidman's filming of ''[[Moulin Rouge!]]'' (2001), and the fracture had never fully healed.<ref name=\"abcnews.go.com\"/> When Kidman left the project, Fincher continued filming scenes that did not include her character. During the same time of Kidman's departure, the [[Writers Guild of America]] and the [[Screen Actors Guild]] were threatening to strike over contractual disputes, so Fincher was pressured to re-cast the role of Meg Altman before it took place. Since the film was early in production, Fincher was ready to shut down, but the studio wanted to continue production and find a replacement. If the studio had shut down production permanently, it would have collected {{nowrap|$3 million}} from insurance. If production was shut down then restarted, it would cost the studio {{nowrap|$10 million}}, necessitating a quick replacement for Kidman.<ref name=\"swallow152\" /> Rumored actors included [[Sandra Bullock]], [[Angelina Jolie]], and [[Robin Wright]]. [[Jodie Foster]] was previously occupied with directing duties of ''Flora Plum'' before its star [[Russell Crowe]] was injured and left the project, leading to that production's shutdown.<ref name=\"swallow152\" /> To join ''Panic Room'', Foster also stepped down as head of the awards jury at the [[2001 Cannes Film Festival]].<ref name=\"swallow152\u2013153\" />{{#tag:ref|James Swallow says Cannes festival organizers were reportedly unhappy with Foster's decision to step down and as a result, they removed ''[[The Dangerous Lives of Altar Boys]]'', which she produced and starred in, from the festival schedule.<ref name=\"swallow152\u2013153\" />|group=\"nb\"}} Foster had a week to prepare for her role before filming resumed.<ref name=\"swallow153\" />\n\nFive weeks after Foster began filming ''Panic Room'', she learned she was pregnant. She informed Fincher and his producer Chaffin of her pregnancy, and they decided to continue filming. Fincher did not want to rush production, so Foster changed her wardrobe from a tank top to a heavy sweater to disguise indications of her pregnancy. For action scenes, stunt double Jill Stokesberry replaced Foster.<ref name=\"swallow154\" />\n\nIn the film's progression, the house degrades in quality, so Fincher filmed scenes in continuity as the set changed.<ref name=\"swallow154\" /> He also filmed many sequences twice due to their near-parallel appearance on the panic room's video monitors.<ref name=\"swallow155\" /> Editor Wall said there were {{nowrap|2,073 set-ups}} for the film with most set-ups having two cameras.<ref name=\"swallow160\" /> One repeated take was when Raoul attempts to break into the panic room through the plaster ceiling below it. The plaster took 45 minutes to replace, so combined with repeated takes, a scene that was an eighth of a page in the script took two days to film.<ref name=\"swallow159\" /> Another repeated take was one five-second shot being filmed over a hundred times: Meg being attacked by Raoul and dropping Sarah's medical kit. The shot was repeated so it would look like Meg did not toss the kit but instead lost it. Simultaneously, the kit needed to land in frame and in focus for the audience. Fincher argued for repeated takes so he could combine performances by the actors for \"fluid\" scenes. He also repeated takes with Stewart to ensure that her acting would be comparable to Foster's veteran performance.<ref name=\"swallow155\" />\n\nThe studio planned to release ''Panic Room'' in February 2002, but it determined that production could not be completed by then.<ref name=\"swallow155\" /> Executives reviewed dailies of the film's opening scene and did not like Foster \"hiding her stomach under a coat and purse\".<ref name=\"swallow156\" /> (Foster was also suffering from a sprained hip from distended ligaments due to her pregnancy.)<ref name=\"swallow155\" /> The studio suspended production until after Foster's childbirth and rescheduled for the film to be released in March 2002. Foster gave birth in September 2001, and she returned to perform re-shoots, including the opening scene. She also returned two months later for additional filming,<ref name=\"swallow156\" /> which concluded that November.<ref name=\"swallow170\" /> Columbia Pictures screened the film for test audiences, who rated poorly the ending with the SWAT raid and Burnham's capture. By the screening, the set had been deconstructed due to storage costs, and Fincher estimated that it would cost {{nowrap|$3 million}} to rebuild enough of the set to reshoot the ending. Instead, editors Haygood and Wall revisited Burnham's scenes and chose takes in which the character would appear less sympathetic. The final production budget for ''Panic Room'' was {{nowrap|$48 million}}.<ref name=\"swallow156\" />\n\n===Visual and practical effects===\n<!--{{Rquote|right|[The title sequence] was just graphic fun. I was playing around. For years we'd joke: 'When you see the credits for a movie, what is that type? Is it supposed to be a projection over the scene or is it supposed to be there? Let's ask that question.' So we started playing around with that idea. The sequence takes a trip up the island of Manhattan through quick shots of buildings to get the idea of, 'You're downtown, you're midtown, you're traversing the park, you're moving to the west side: here's where the story takes place.' This was the same idea as the title sequence to ''West Side Story'', so we had to do something a little different.|David Fincher<ref name=\"Perkins\"/> }}\n-->\nA seamless shot at the beginning of ''Panic Room'' took nine days to film on set but took several months to complete in post-production. The shot was a combination of camera footage and computer-generated effects. Koepp originally wrote the opening scene to be a series of shots that would zero in on the brownstone house, but Fincher instead chose a sequence of landmarks in New York City with credits hovering in front of them before the sequence transited seamlessly to introduce the film's main characters.<ref name=\"swallow164\" /> The opening titles were inspired by those seen in ''[[The Trouble with Harry]]'' (1955) and ''[[North by Northwest]]'' (1959).<ref name=\"swallow168\u2013169\" /> The scene of Burnham's arrest also used computer-generated effects. Several scenes also involved practical effects: Junior's injuries from a flaming gas burn and Stephen Altman's bloodied, beaten self. A team of puppeteers was used to move Stephen's sticking-out collarbone. Fincher also sent the film reel to be digitally color-corrected as he had done for ''Fight Club'' and ''[[Seven (1995 film)|Seven]]''.<ref name=\"swallow165\" />\n\n==Analysis==\n===Conspiracy thrillers and feminism===\nAcademic Jyotsna Kapur identifies ''Panic Room'' as one of several American conspiracy thrillers in the 2000s that re-cast the subject of childhood as \"one of horror and alarm\",{{#tag:ref|Kapur's other examples of such thrillers include: ''[[Crash (2004 film)|Crash]]'' (2004), ''[[The Forgotten (2004 film)|The Forgotten]]'' (2004), ''[[Flightplan]]'' (2005), ''[[Syriana]]'' (2005), ''[[Babel (film)|Babel]]'' (2006), ''[[Children of Men]]'' (2006), and ''[[The Good Shepherd (film)|The Good Shepherd]]'' (2006).<ref name=\"kapur44\" />|group=\"nb\"}} where it had previously been a subject of celebration in family films dating back to the early 1980s.<ref name=\"kapur44\" /> Kapur also says the depiction of paranoia in the decade's conspiracy thrillers is divided by gender, describing the male protagonist as \"an idealized subject who thinks fast on his feet and cuts through fear to find the conspirators\". In contrast, the female protagonist \"gives in to her fear, turns delusional and vulnerable to suggestion\"; Kapur cites Meg Altman in ''Panic Room'' as such a depiction with her divorcee status and her residence in a home too big for her and her daughter Sarah. The academic says calling this depiction merely a sexist stereotype is too dismissive: \"It is logical that anxieties around the home and loss of children would privilege women because the [[Separate spheres|domestic sphere]] has remained a gendered space.\" Kapur recalls 1940s films wherein a woman enters the husband's home as a stranger, with \"the house and the husband as sources of dependence and dread\".{{#tag:ref|Such 1940s films include ''[[Rebecca (1940 film)|Rebecca]]'' (1940), ''[[Gaslight (1944 film)|Gaslight]]'' (1944), ''[[The Two Mrs. Carrolls]]'' (1947), ''[[Secret Beyond the Door]]'' (1948), and ''[[Caught (1949 film)|Caught]]'' (1949).<ref name=\"kapur47\u201349\" />|group=\"nb\"}} She contrasts them with films like ''Panic Room'', in which the female protagonists instead defend against dangerous intruders. She writes, \"They are not economically dependent on the marriage. Yet they portray for most of the film an image of feminized vulnerability, replaying the racist trope of diminutive white women in need of protection from outsider threats.\"<ref name=\"kapur47\u201349\" />\n\n===Medicine and technology as themes===\n''Panic Room'' is one of several films at the turn of the 21st century that use video surveillance as a key element.{{#tag:ref|Kammerer also references the following films: ''[[The End of Violence]]'' (1997), ''[[Lost Highway (film)|Lost Highway]]'' (1997), ''[[Enemy of the State (film)|Enemy of the State]]'' (1998), ''[[Snake Eyes (1998 film)|Snake Eyes]]'' (1998), and ''[[The Truman Show]]'' (1998). He also mentions older examples: ''[[Peeping Tom (1960 film)|Peeping Tom]]'' (1960) and ''[[The Osterman Weekend (film)|The Osterman Weekend]]'' (1983).<ref name=\"kammerer468\" />|group=\"nb\"}} In particular, video surveillance is featured to illustrate aspects of a \"[[Mass surveillance|surveillance society]]\".<ref name=\"kammerer468\" /> The home is wired with a [[closed-circuit television]] system, and the images are displayed in the home's panic room. Since the burglars want to access the safe in the panic room where Meg and her daughter Sarah are hiding, there is an irreconcilable contradiction of freedom and safety. Dietmar Kammerer says there is no closed system within the home for the characters: \"There is always communication; every action provokes a reaction.\"<ref name=\"kammerer471\" /> In contrast, the film's \"camera eye\" can travel unimpeded throughout the home, passing through walls. The surveillance footage in the film is never the camera eye; the camera eye itself observes the footage on the monitors. Of the cameras, Kammerer says, they are \"Extremely mobile, but unstable: the surveillance technology in ''Panic Room'' is useful and harmful, good and evil at once.\" When the cameras are destroyed, Meg and Sarah are able to overcome the burglars. Kammerer says the cameras reflect ambivalence in the film, between \"freedom and security, openness and closedness\".<ref name=\"kammerer472\" />\n\nIn the film, Sarah is diabetic. Kevin L. Ferguson says, \"With diabetes, this self-aware focus on the ethics of the body is drawn sharply by films that also raise the older form of direct, punitive power. This is the reason why diabetics appear with frequency in films involving criminality and law.\" In a review of nearly forty films with diabetes as a key element,<ref name=\"ferguson192\u2013193\" /> ''Panic Room'' is one of the only three that shows a [[glucometer]] (a device diabetics use to measure their [[glucose]]; Sarah wears a glucometer as a watch.) Sarah's diabetes in the film is never explicitly outlined for audiences, but they hear dialogue about moderating beverage intake and see the glucometer count down. Ferguson says, \"The glucometer arranges the viewer's acknowledgement of diabetic selfcare, thus implicating the viewer in the process of control. The pure watchfulness of cinemagoers mimics the controlling relationship diabetic characters must endure.\"<ref name=\"ferguson194\u2013195\" /> Though mother and daughter bond in the film, the mother actively monitors her daughter's health. Ferguson says, \"''Panic Room''{{'}}s emphasis on vision and technology necessitates a paternalistic, monitoring attitude towards the diabetic character.\"<ref name=\"ferguson196\" /> He also notes that the glucometer parallels the overarching surveillance system in the film in being read \"excessively\".<ref name=\"ferguson200\u2013201\" />\n\n===Approach to mortality===\nAcademic John Kitterman says audiences see ''Panic Room'' as a way to confront their fears and to achieve catharsis, but he argues that the film cannot provide that experience authentically.<ref name=\"kitterman239\" /> He notes that the film's protagonist Meg Altman is reminded by the panic room of author [[Edgar Allan Poe]], who wrote several short stories related to [[premature burial]]. Kitterman highlights one story, \"[[The Premature Burial]]\", as synonymous with ''Panic Room''.<ref name=\"kitterman237\" /> He says, in both works, \"It is in the representing or acting out of such fears of being buried alive or being the victim of a home invasion that the protagonist actually calls for that trauma to happen.\"<ref name=\"kitterman238\u2013239\" /> He says that Meg's nervous recognition of the panic room guarantees that her fear will come to pass.<ref name=\"kitterman239\" /> Though the home \"looks like a mausoleum\", the combination of the panic room's being able to monitor all the rooms and the unbounded movement of the film's camera leads audiences to believe they have some control over confronting their fears.<ref name=\"kitterman240\" /> Kitterman says the confrontation is unauthentic because of the function of [[Jacques Lacan]]'s [[The Symbolic|symbolic order]], \"We can never find what we are looking for because truth and reality exist on a different plane of discovery... Truth is hidden in the symbolic order, and no panoptical vision is going to reveal it to us.\"<ref name=\"kitterman240\u2013241\" /> Kitterman says the film hides the truth of mortality, especially by making everywhere in the film visible to audiences. He concludes, \"[Fincher] hides the truth behind a veil of visibility, using the camera to create a hegemony of vision that brainwashes us all into believing that what we are seeing is real. But the real of death cannot be symbolized.\"<ref name=\"kitterman241\" />\n\n==Theatrical run==\nColumbia Pictures marketed ''Panic Room'' as being produced by the same director who produced ''[[Seven (1995 film)|Seven]]'' and ''[[Fight Club]]''. Fincher disagreed with the approach because he believed that ''Panic Room'' did not match the tone of his previous two films and that it would not appeal to the same audiences. He believed ''Panic Room'' would appeal more to audiences who saw ''[[Kiss the Girls (1997 film)|Kiss the Girls]]'' (1997) and ''[[The Bone Collector]]'' (1999). He also disagreed with the studio's marketing materials for ''Panic Room'', which advertised it as \"the most terrifying movie ever made\". Fincher also argued with the studio about the poster design, which he believed reflected the film's themes, and the studio relented in publishing Fincher's poster.<ref name=\"swallow171\" />\n\n''Panic Room'' had its world premiere on {{nowrap|March 18}}, 2002 in Los Angeles.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.cbsnews.com/pictures/kristen-stewart/27/ | title=2002 \u2013 Kristen Stewart (Panic Room Premiere) | publisher=[[CBS News]] | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210119020804/https://www.cbsnews.com/pictures/kristen-stewart/27/ | archive-date=January 19, 2021 | access-date=January 19, 2021 | url-status=live }}</ref> Fincher refused to edit the film to receive a PG-13 rating (parental guidance for children under 13) from the [[Motion Picture Association of America]],<ref name=\"swallow170\" /> so the MPAA gave the film an R rating (restricted to filmgoers at least 17 years old) for violence and language.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.filmratings.com/filmRatings_cara/reports/s10637929.htm | title=Panic Room | work=filmratings.com | publisher=[[Motion Picture Association of America]] | access-date=December 14, 2012 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924012909/http://www.filmratings.com/filmRatings_cara/reports/s10637929.htm | archive-date=September 24, 2015 | url-status=dead }}</ref> It was commercially released in the United States and Canada on March 29, 2002.
