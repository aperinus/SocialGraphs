[[Edward Bond]] wrote the screenplay, which is loosely based on the 1959 novel [[Walkabout (novel)|''Walkabout'']] by [[James Vance Marshall]]. Set in the [[Australian outback]], it centres on two white schoolchildren who are left to fend for themselves in the Australian outback and who come across a teenage [[Aboriginal Australians|Aboriginal]] boy who helps them to survive.\n\nRoeg's second feature film, ''Walkabout'' was released internationally by [[20th Century Fox]], and was one of the first films in the [[Australian New Wave]] cinema movement. Alongside ''[[Wake in Fright]]'', it was one of two Australian films entered in competition for the [[Palme d'Or|Grand Prix du Festival]] at the [[1971 Cannes Film Festival]].<ref name=cannes1971>\n{{cite web\n| url         = http://www.festival-cannes.fr/en/archives/1971/inCompetition.html\n| title       =  Official Selection 1971\n| website= Festival de Cannes \n| location    = France\n| archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20101202195148/http://www.festival-cannes.fr/en/archives/1971/inCompetition.html\n| archive-date = 2 December 2010\n| quote       = Official Selection 1971....WALKABOUT directed by Nicolas ROEG\n}}</ref> It was subsequently released in the United States in July 1971, and in Australia in December 1971.\n\nIn 2005, the [[British Film Institute]] included it in their list of the \"50 films you should see by the age of 14\".\n\n== Plot ==\nA white teenage girl and her younger brother live with their parents in a modest high rise apartment in [[Sydney]]. One day their father drives them into the [[Outback]], still in their school uniforms, ostensibly for a picnic. As they prepare to eat, the father draws a gun and begins firing at the children. The boy believes it to be a game, but the daughter realises her father is attempting to murder them, and flees with her brother, seeking shelter behind rocks. She watches as her father sets their car on fire and shoots himself in the head. The girl conceals the suicide from her brother, retrieves some of the picnic food, and leads him away from the scene, attempting to walk home through the desert.\n\nBy the middle of the next day, they are weak and the boy can barely walk. Discovering an oasis with a small water hole and a fruit tree, they spend the day playing, bathing, and resting. By the next morning, the water has dried up. They are then discovered by an Aboriginal boy. He does not speak English, much to the girl's frustration, but her brother mimes their need for water and the newcomer cheerfully shows them how to draw it from the drying bed of the oasis. The three travel together, with the Aboriginal boy sharing [[kangaroo]] meat he has caught from hunting. The boys learn to communicate to some extent using words from each other's languages and gestures; the girl makes no such attempts.\n\nWhile in the vicinity of a [[plantation]], a white woman walks past the Aboriginal boy, who simply ignores her when she speaks to him. She appears to see the other children, but they do not see her, and they continue on their journey. The children also discover a [[weather balloon]] belonging to a nearby research team working in the desert. After drawing markings of a modern-style house, the Aboriginal boy eventually leads them to an abandoned farm, and takes the small boy to a nearby road. The Aboriginal boy hunts down a [[water buffalo]] and is wrestling it to the ground when two white hunters appear in a truck and nearly run him over. He watches in shock as they wantonly shoot several buffalo with a rifle. The boy then returns to the farm, but passes by without speaking.\n\nLater, the Aboriginal boy lies in a trance among a slew of buffalo bones, having painted himself in ceremonial markings. He returns to the farmhouse, catching the undressing girl by surprise, and initiates a [[Courtship|mating ritual]] by performing a [[courtship dance]] in front of her.{{sfn|Roeg|1998|loc=1:20:00}} Although he dances outside all day and into the night until he becomes exhausted, she is frightened and hides from him, and tells her brother they will leave him the next day. In the morning, after they dress in their school uniforms, the brother takes her to the Aboriginal boy's body, hanging in a tree. Showing little emotion, the girl wipes ants from the dead boy's chest. Hiking up the road, the siblings find a nearly-deserted mining town where a surly employee directs them towards nearby accommodation.\n\nYears later, a man arrives home from work as the now adult girl prepares dinner. While he embraces her and relates office gossip, she either imagines or remembers a time in which she, her brother, and the Aboriginal boy are playing and [[nude swimming|swimming naked]] in a [[billabong]] in the [[outback]].\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast list|\n* [[Jenny Agutter]] as Girl\n* [[Nicolas Roeg#Personal life|Luc Roeg]] (credited as Lucien John) as White Boy\n* [[David Gulpilil]] (miscredited as David Gumpilil) as Black Boy\n* [[John Meillon]] as Father\n* [[Robert McDarra]] as Man\n* Pete Carver as No Hoper\n* John Illingsworth as Husband\n* Hilary Bamberger as Woman\n* Barry Donnelly as Australian Scientist\n* [[Noeline Brown]] as German Scientist\n* Carlo Manchini as Italian Scientist\n}}\nNone of the characters are named.\n\n==Themes==\nActress Jenny Agutter regards the film as multilayered, in one regard being a story about children lost in the outback finding their way, and in the other, an [[allegory|allegorical]] tale about modern society and the loss of innocence.<ref name=criterionint/> Australian filmmaker [[Louis Nowra]] noted that [[Bible|biblical]] imagery runs throughout the film; in one scene there is a cut to a subliminal flashback of the father's suicide, but the scene plays in reverse and the father rises up as if he has been \"[[resurrection|resurrected]]\". Many writers have also drawn a direct parallel between the depiction of the [[Outback]] and the [[Garden of Eden]], with Nowra observing that this went as far as to include \"portents of a snake slithering across the bare branches of the tree\" above Agutter's character as she sleeps.{{sfn|Nowra|2003|p=36}}\n\nGregory Stephens, an associate professor of English, sees the film framed as a typical \"back to Eden\" story, including common motifs from 1960s [[counterculture]]; he offers the [[skinny-dipping]] sequence as an example of a \"symbolic shedding of the clothes of the over-civilized world\".{{Sfn|Stephens|2018|p=142}} By way of the girl's rejection of the Aboriginal boy and his subsequent death the film paints the Outback as \"an Eden that can only ever be lost\".{{sfn|Goldsmith|Lealand|2010|p=210}} Agutter shares a similar interpretation, noting \"we cannot go back and have that Garden of Eden. We cannot go back and make it innocent again.\" Agutter considers the ages of the two adolescents, who are on the cusp of adulthood and losing their childhood innocence, as a metaphor for the irreversible change wrought by [[Western civilisation]].<ref name=criterionint>{{cite interview |subject=Agutter, Jenny |title=Jenny Agutter on Walkabout |publisher=[[The Criterion Collection]] |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JHjmTXbc3w |access-date=13 November 2019|quote=It has to be that particular age [adolescence of the European girl and the aboriginal boy] where the innocence is just going. Because of course what Nick Roeg... Nick Roeg is talking about many things - the film has lots of layers to it. There is the story about children lost in the outback, finding their way. There is a story about society and the loss of innocence. And the film is about losing one's innocence and not being able to go back, once you have gone to a certain stage. And that is our Western society: we go to a certain place, and then we are spoiled, we are changed. Whatever it is, we cannot go back and have that Garden of Eden. We cannot go back and make it innocent again. We cannot go back once we have got to a certain stage.|via=YouTube}}</ref>\n\n== Production ==\nThe film was the second feature directed by Nicolas Roeg, a British filmmaker. He had long planned to make a film of the novel ''[[Walkabout (novel)|Walkabout]]'', in which the children are Americans stranded by a plane crash. After the indigenous boy finds and leads them to safety, he dies of [[influenza]] contracted from them, as he has not been immunised. Roeg had not been able to find a script he was happy with, until the English playwright [[Edward Bond]] did a minimal 14-page screenplay. Roeg then obtained backing from two American businessmen, [[Max Raab]] and Si Litvinoff, who incorporated a company in Australia but raised the budget entirely in the US and sold world rights to [[20th Century Fox]].\n\nFilming began in Sydney in August 1969 and later moved to [[Alice Springs]],{{sfn|Pike|Cooper|1998|p=258}} and Roeg's son, Luc, played the younger boy in the film. Roeg brought an outsider's eye and interpretation to the Australian setting, and improvised greatly during filming. He commented, \"We didn\u2019t really plan anything\u2014we just came across things by chance\u2026filming whatever we found.\"<ref name=\"harma\">{{cite web\n|author= Fiona Harma\n|url= http://wwwmcc.murdoch.edu.au/ReadingRoom/film/dbase/2001/walkabout.html\n|title= Walkabout\n|access-date=18 February 2008\n|year= 2001\n|work= The Oz Film Database\n|publisher= Murdoch University\n}}\n</ref> The film is an example of Roeg's well-defined directorial style, characterised by strong visual composition from his experience as a [[cinematographer]], combined with extensive [[cross-cutting]] and the juxtaposition of events, location, or environments to build his themes.<ref>{{cite web\n|author= Chuck Kleinhans\n|title= Nicholas Roeg\u2014Permutations without profundity\n|url=http://www.ejumpcut.org/archive/onlinessays/JC03folder/RoegKleinhans.html \n|publisher= Jump Cut: A Review of Contemporary Media\n|access-date=17 February 2008 }}\n</ref> The music was composed and conducted by [[John Barry (composer)|John Barry]], and produced by [[Phil Ramone]], and the poem read at the end of the film is ''[[:s:A Shropshire Lad/XL|Poem 40]]'' from [[A.

He wanted me to be uninhibited \u2013 which I wasn\u2019t. I was a very inhibited young woman. I didn\u2019t feel uncomfortable about the intention of the scene, but that doesn\u2019t make you feel any better. There was no one around, apart from Nic in the distance with his camera.

The [[Protection of Children Act 1978]] prohibited distribution and possession of indecent images of people under the age of 16 so the issue of potential indecency had not been considered on previous occasions. However, the [[Sexual Offences Act 2003]] raised the age threshold to 18 which meant the BBFC was required to consider the scenes of nudity in the context of the new law when the film was re-submitted in 2011. The BBFC reviewed the scenes and considered them not to be indecent and passed the film uncut.<ref name=bbfc />\n\nThe film features several scenes of animal hunting and killing, such as a kangaroo being speared and bludgeoned to death. The [[Cinematograph Films (Animals) Act 1937]] makes it illegal in the United Kingdom to distribute or exhibit material where the production involved inflicting pain or terror on an animal. Since the animals did not appear to suffer or be in distress the film was deemed not to contravene the Act.<ref name=bbfc />\n\n== Reception ==\n''Walkabout'' fared poorly at the box office in Australia. Critics debated whether it could be considered an Australian film, and whether it was an embrace of or a reaction to the country's cultural and natural context.<ref name=\"harma\"/> In the US, the film was originally [[Motion Picture Association film rating system#MPA film ratings|rated]] R by the [[MPAA]] due to nudity, but was reduced to a GP-rating (PG) on appeal.\n\nCritic [[Roger Ebert]] called it \"one of the great films\".<ref>{{cite web \n| date = 13 April 1997\n| last = Ebert\n| first = Roger\n| author-link = Roger Ebert\n| title = Walkabout (1971) \n| website = RogerEbert.com\n| url = https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/great-movie-walkabout-1971 \n| access-date = 18 November 2018\n}}</ref><ref name=\"ebert\">{{cite web\n| last = Ebert\n| first = Roger\n| author-link = Roger Ebert\n| title =  Walkabout by Nicolas Roeg\n| publisher = [[The Criterion Collection]]\n| url = http://www.criterion.com/asp/release.asp?id=10&eid=25&section=essay1\n| access-date = 17 February 2008 }}</ref> He writes that it contains little moral or emotional judgement of its characters, and ultimately is a portrait of isolation in proximity. At the time, he stated: \"Is it a [[parable]] about [[noble savage]]s and the crushed spirits of city dwellers? That's what the film's surface suggests, but I think it's about something deeper and more elusive: the mystery of communication.\"<ref name=\"ebert\" /> Film critic Edward Guthmann also notes the strong use of exotic natural images, calling them a \"chorus of lizards\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/1997/01/03/DD10146.DTL |title= Intriguing 'Walkabout' in the Past |access-date=18 February 2008 |author= Guthmann, Edward |date= 3 January 1997 |work= [[San Francisco Chronicle]]}}\n</ref> In ''Walkabout'', an analysis of the film, author [[Louis Nowra]] wrote: \"I was stunned.

The Outback was beautiful and haunting.\"{{sfn|Nowra|1998|p=5}}\n\n=== Legacy ===\nCommenting on the film's enduring appeal, Roeg described the film in 1998 as \"a simple story about life and being alive, not covered with sophistry but addressing the most basic human themes; birth, death, mutability.\"<ref>{{citation|title=Walkabout: An Outsider's Vision Endures|date=27 March 1998|author=Danielsen, Shane|work=The Australian}}\n</ref>\n\nMore than 50 years after its release, on review aggregator [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film holds a score of 85% based on reviews from 40 critics, with an average rating of 8.2 out of 10.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/walkabout/|title=Walkabout|work= [[Rotten Tomatoes]] |access-date=16 August 2022}}</ref> In the 2012 [[British Film Institute|BFI]] survey of the world's greatest films, Walkabout featured in 4 critics' and 4 directors' choices of their favourite films.<ref>[https://www2.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b6ba2864d Walkabout at BFI]</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n*{{cite book |editor1-first=Ben |editor1-last=Goldsmith |editor2-first=Geoffrey |editor2-last=Lealand |title=Australia and New Zealand |series=Directory of world cinema |year=2010 |publisher=Intellect Books |isbn=978-1-841-50373-8 |location=Bristol, England}}\n*{{cite book |first=Louis |last=Nowra |author-link=Louis Nowra |title=Walkabout |series=Australian Screen Classics |year=2003 |publisher=[[Currency Press]] |isbn=978-0-868-19700-5|location=London, England}}\n*{{cite book|last1=Pike|first1=Andrew|last2=Cooper|first2=Ross|year=1998|title=Australian Film 1900\u20131977: A Guide to Feature Film Production|location=Melbourne, Australia|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn= 978-0-195-54332-2}}\n* {{Cite AV media |last=Roeg|first=Nicolas|author-link=Nicolas Roeg| title = Walkabout | medium = [[Audio commentary]] | publisher = [[The Criterion Collection]] | location = United States | year = 1998  | isbn = 0780020847}}\n*{{cite book |first=Gregory |last=Stephens |title=Trilogies as Cultural Analysis: Literary Re-imaginings of Sea Crossings, Animals, and Fathering |year=2018 |publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing |isbn=978-1-527-51911-4 |location=Cambridge, England}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{IMDb title|0067959}}\n* {{Amg movie|115855}}\n* {{Rotten-tomatoes|walkabout}}\n* {{Metacritic film}}\n* [https://www.criterion.com/current/posts/1466-walkabout-landscapes-of-memory ''Walkabout: Landscapes of Memory''] an essay by Paul Ryan at the [[Criterion Collection]] \n* [https://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4fc75e3b0cfe7 ''Walkabout'' Q & A with Nic Roeg, Lucien Roeg and Jenny Agutter at BFI in 2011]\n* [http://www.ozmovies.com.au/movie/walkabout ''Walkabout''] at Oz Movies\n\n{{Nicolas Roeg}}\n{{Films and television series about Indigenous Australia}}\n\n[[Category:1971 films]]\n[[Category:1970s adventure drama films]]\n[[Category:Australian adventure drama films]]\n[[Category:British adventure drama films]]\n[[Category:Fiction about familicide]]\n[[Category:Films about Aboriginal Australians]]\n[[Category:Films about siblings]]\n[[Category:Films based on British novels]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Nicolas Roeg]]\n[[Category:Films about hunters]]\n[[Category:Films scored by John Barry (composer)]]\n[[Category:Films set in deserts]]\n[[Category:Films set in the Outback]]\n[[Category:Films shot in the Northern Territory]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by Edward Bond]]\n[[Category:British survival films]]\n[[Category:20th Century Fox films]]\n[[Category:1970s English-language films]]\n[[Category:1970s British films]]"}]}}}}
