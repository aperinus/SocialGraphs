The townspeople found out the father and son duo had been ripping out the patients' hearts \u2014 in an attempt to bring back the doctor's dead wife. The townspeople [[stoning|stoned]] Dr. Rendell to death, but his son Evan Jr. disappeared.\n\nThirty-five years later, the adult Evan Jr. (now nicknamed \"Dr. Giggles\" for his hideous laugh and insatiable obsession to follow in his father's footsteps) escapes from a mental asylum, killing everyone in his path. In Moorehigh, 19-year-old Jennifer Campbell, her boyfriend Max Anderson, and their friends are planning their summer break. Jennifer, already upset by family trouble, is further distressed from having a heart condition and being forced to wear a heart monitor. Dr. Giggles returns to his childhood home, goes through Evan Sr.'s files, and gathers a list of names. He begins stalking and killing several residents, including Jennifer's friends.\n\nAfter the party, Jennifer becomes fed up with her heart monitor and dumps it in a fish tank. Jennifer's father finds it and leaves to look for her. Dr. Giggles shows up and kills his girlfriend (Jennifer's prospective stepmother). Jennifer returns to the party and sees Max kissing another girl. Distraught, she runs into the house of mirrors. Dr. Giggles notices Jennifer has the same heart condition as his mother and goes after her. He kills the girl Max was kissing, but Jennifer sees him coming and escapes. Officers Magruder and Reitz find her and take her to the police station.\n\nOfficer Magruder explains to Reitz how Evan Jr. escaped. He was on guard duty at the morgue housing the bodies of Dr. Rendell and his wife. Investigating a giggle, he witnessed Evan Jr. cutting his way out of his mother's body with a scalpel. He realized that Rendell had cut open his wife's body, stuffed his son in and sewn it shut. Upon being threatened by Evan Jr., Magruder passed out from shock. When he woke up, Rendell's wife's corpse had been re-sewn, and all traces of the event at the morgue had been wiped clean.\n\nDr. Giggles makes his way to Jennifer's house and attacks her father. Officer Magruder goes to investigate Jennifer's house and finds her father there, lying in a pool of blood. Dr. Giggles mortally wounds Magruder who, recognizing Evan Jr., shoots and wounds him before dying. Reitz arrives soon after, finding his partner dead and Jennifer's father wounded but alive.\n\nMeanwhile, Dr. Giggles returns to his hideout, performing surgery on himself to remove the bullet. He kidnaps Jennifer and tells her his plan to replace her \"broken\" heart with one he took from her friends. Reitz and Max arrive. While Reitz distracts Dr. Giggles, Max and Jennifer escape. Dr. Giggles kills Reitz, but his father's house explodes and collapses on him.\n\nAt the hospital, Jennifer learns that the events of the evening have damaged her heart, requiring immediate surgery. While she is being prepped, Dr. Giggles reappears and cuts a bloody path through the hospital staff. He chases her to a janitor's closet. Jennifer ambushes and finally kills Dr. Giggles with his own instruments. Dr. Giggles [[fourth wall|breaks the fourth wall]], staring at the camera and weakly asking, \"Is...there a...doctor in the house?\" before he collapses and dies.\n\nRecovering in the hospital, Jennifer is visited by Max and her father.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Larry Drake]] as Dr. Evan Rendell Jr. / Dr. Giggles\n* [[Holly Marie Combs]] as Jennifer Campbell\n* [[Cliff DeYoung]] as Tom Campbell\n* [[Glenn Quinn]] as Max Anderson\n* [[Keith Diamond (actor)|Keith Diamond]] as Officer Joe Reitz\n* [[Richard Bradford (actor)|Richard Bradford]] as Officer Hank Magruder\n* [[Michelle Johnson (actress)|Michelle Johnson]] as Tamara\n* [[John Vickery (actor)|John Vickery]] as Dr. Chamberlain\n* Nancy Fish as Elaine Henderson\n* [[Doug E.
