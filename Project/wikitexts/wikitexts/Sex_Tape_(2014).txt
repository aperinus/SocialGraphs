After he [[Erectile dysfunction|struggles to get an erection]], she suggests making a [[sex tape]]. They film themselves having sex in every position listed in ''[[The Joy of Sex]]''.\n\nWhen done, Annie asks Jay to delete the recording, which they hate, but he ends up instead inadvertently synchronizing the video to several [[iPad]]s the couple had given away over time. After failing to get it out of [[Cloud computing|the cloud]], they set out to get back all of the gifted iPads, leading to a series of awkward encounters and close calls.\n\nAfter collecting the iPads and deleting the videos, their friend's son, Howard, threatens to upload a copy of their sex tape to [[YouPorn]] unless they give him $25,000. After failing to get the money, they break into the YouPorn headquarters and begin to destroy their [[web server]]s. Their plan is quickly thwarted when an alarm sounds. The owner and his guards confront them and threaten to call the police, but agree not to do so in exchange for $15,000 to cover the damage. He also removes their video and explains that all they had to do to have a video removed was send him an e-mail request for such removal.\n\nAfter they have deleted all videos, Howard comes over to the house and gives Jay the only existing copy of the video on a USB flash drive in exchange for being allowed to hang out with their son, Clive, since he is his only friend.\n\nAs the film comes to a close, Jay and Annie decide to watch the video once themselves. Afterwards, they take the [[USB flash drive]] containing the video and go outside to smash it with a hammer, blend it, burn it with fire, and bury the remains.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Cameron Diaz]] as Annie Hargrove\n* [[Jason Segel]] as Jay Hargrove\n* [[Rob Corddry]] as Robby Thompson\n* [[Ellie Kemper]] as Tess Thompson\n* [[Rob Lowe]] as Hank Rosenbaum, Annie's boss\n* Harrison Holzer as Howard\n* [[Nat Faxon]] as Max\n* [[Nancy Lenehan]] as Linda\n* [[Randall Park]] as Edward\n* [[Jack Black]] (''uncredited cameo'') as Lamont, the owner of [[YouPorn]]\n* [[Jolene Blalock]] as Catalina, the wife of the owner of YouPorn\n* [[Dave Allen (actor)|Dave \"Gruber\" Allen]] as Mailman\n* [[Kumail Nanjiani]] as Punit\n* [[Artemis Pebdani]] as Kia\n}}\n\n==Production==\n\n===Development===\n[[Sony Pictures]] acquired the script in June 2011,<ref>{{cite web|author1=Fleming, Mike|title=Sony Pictures Pays Big Bucks To Buy 'Sex Tape' |url=https://www.deadline.com/2011/06/sony-pictures-pays-big-bucks-to-buy-sex-tape/ |website=[[Deadline Hollywood]] |access-date=August 6, 2014|date=June 3, 2011}}</ref> which was based on an original story created by Kate Angelo.
