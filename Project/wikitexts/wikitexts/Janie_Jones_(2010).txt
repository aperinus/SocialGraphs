Rosenthal (director)|David M. Rosenthal]]. It stars [[Abigail Breslin]] as the title character, as well as [[Alessandro Nivola]], [[Elisabeth Shue]], [[Brittany Snow]], and [[Peter Stormare]]. The story is about a fading, alcoholic rock star meeting his daughter for the first time after being left by her drugged-up mother, and the growing relationship they have while on tour. Rosenthal based the film's storyline on his real-life meeting with his own daughter.\n\nThe film makes extensive use of original music created by [[Gemma Hayes]] and [[Eef Barzelay]], and is performed by Breslin and Nivola. It was shot in Des Moines in September 2009. It premiered at the [[2010 Toronto International Film Festival]] on September 17, 2010, got picked up by [[Tribeca Film]] to show at their [[Tribeca Film Festival|festival]] on April 29, 2011, and was given a limited release on October 28. ''Janie Jones'' received mixed reviews from critics who gave praise to the two main leads but found Rosenthal's storytelling and direction lacking in terms of originality and tonal pacing.\n\n==Plot==\n{{More plot|date=January 2021}}\nA 13-year-old girl is abandoned by her meth-addicted former-groupie mother, after she informs Ethan Brand, an alcoholic, on-the-road, fading rock star, that Janie is his daughter, and he is not happy about it.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Abigail Breslin]] as Janie Jones\n*[[Alessandro Nivola]] as Ethan Brand\n*[[Elisabeth Shue]] as Mary Ann Jones\n*[[Brittany Snow]] as Iris\n*[[Peter Stormare]] as Sloan\n*[[Joel David Moore]] as Dave\n*[[Frances Fisher]] as Lily Brand\n*[[Frank Whaley]] as Chuck\n*[[Rodney Eastman]] as Billy\n\n==Production==\nDavid M.
