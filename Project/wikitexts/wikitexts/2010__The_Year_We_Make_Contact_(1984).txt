It is a sequel to [[Stanley Kubrick]]'s 1968 film ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]'' and is based on [[Arthur C. Clarke]]'s 1982 sequel novel, ''[[2010: Odyssey Two]]''. The film stars [[Roy Scheider]], [[Helen Mirren]], [[Bob Balaban]] and [[John Lithgow]], along with [[Keir Dullea]] and [[Douglas Rain]] of the cast of the previous film.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 to 700 words. -->\nNine years after the [[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|failure]] of the ''[[Discovery One]]'' mission to [[Jupiter]] in 2001, in which the crew of five including mission commander David Bowman were lost, an international dispute causes tension between the United States and the Soviet Union while both nations prepare space missions to determine what happened to the ''Discovery''. The Soviet spacecraft ''Leonov'' will be ready a year before the American ''Discovery Two'', but the Soviets need Americans to board the ''Discovery'' and reactivate the ship's [[sentience|sentient]] computer, [[HAL 9000]], apparently responsible for the disaster. Upon learning that ''Discovery'' will crash into Jupiter's moon [[Io (moon)|Io]] before the American mission can launch, Dr. Heywood Floyd, ''Discovery'' designer Walter Curnow, and HAL 9000's creator Dr. Chandra are permitted to join the Soviet mission.\n\nArriving at Jupiter, the crew detects organic molecules on Jupiter's icy moon [[Europa (moon)|Europa]]. A probe sent to investigate is destroyed by an energy burst, which the Soviets believe to be [[Electrostatic discharge|electrostatic build-up]], but which Floyd suspects is a warning to stay away from Europa. Finding ''Discovery'' adrift in orbit over Io, Curnow reactivates the ship, and Chandra restarts HAL. Cosmonaut Max Brailovsky investigates the nearby giant [[Monolith (Space Odyssey)|Monolith]] at which Bowman disappeared while exploring, but the Monolith destroys his EVA pod with a burst of energy, killing him.\n\nOn Earth, Dave Bowman, now an [[incorporeality|incorporeal]] being, appears through his former wife's television to say goodbye, telling her that \"something wonderful\" is going to happen. He then visits his comatose mother in a nursing home. She briefly awakens in delight at her son's presence, before dying peacefully.\n\nChandra discovers the reasons for HAL's malfunction: the [[United States National Security Council|National Security Council]] ordered HAL to conceal information about the Monolith from the ''Discovery''{{'}}s crew and programmed him to complete the mission alone; this conflicted with HAL's programming of open, accurate processing of information, causing the computer equivalent of a [[paranoia|paranoid]] [[mental breakdown]]. When Bowman and copilot Frank Poole discussed deactivating the malfunctioning computer, HAL judged that the human crew was endangering the mission, and terminated them. Although the NSC's order bears his signature, Floyd angrily denies having known of it.\n\nBack on Earth, the United States and the Soviet Union are on the brink of war. The Americans are ordered to leave the ''Leonov'' and move to the ''Discovery'', with no further communication between the crews. Both ships plan to leave Jupiter in several weeks' time, but Bowman appears to Floyd, and says that everyone must leave within two days. Floyd confers with the skeptical Soviet captain, Tanya Kirbuk. The crews agree to cooperate for an emergency departure when the Monolith suddenly disappears, and a growing black spot appears in Jupiter's atmosphere. Neither ship has the fuel to reach Earth if they leave ahead of schedule, so the ships are docked together, and placed under the control of HAL 9000. ''Discovery''{{'}}s remaining fuel will be burned to propel the ''Leonov'' away from Jupiter; then ''Discovery'' will be undocked and left behind.\n\nHAL determines that the spot is a vast group of Monoliths, multiplying exponentially and altering Jupiter's density and chemical composition. He suggests canceling the launch in order to study the changes occurring to Jupiter. Floyd worries that HAL will prioritize his mission over the humans' survival, but Chandra admits to the computer that there is a danger, and that ''Discovery'' may be destroyed. HAL thanks Chandra for telling him the truth, and ensures the ''Leonov''{{'}}s escape. Before ''Discovery'' is destroyed, Bowman asks HAL to transmit a priority message, assuring him that they will soon be together. The Monoliths engulf Jupiter, which undergoes [[nuclear fusion]], becoming a new star. HAL transmits this message to Earth:\n\n{{center|<samp><poem>\nALL THESE WORLDS\nARE YOURS EXCEPT\nEUROPA\nATTEMPT NO\nLANDING THERE\nUSE THEM TOGETHER\nUSE THEM IN PEACE\n</poem></samp>}}\n\nThe ''Leonov'' survives the shockwave from Jupiter's ignition, and returns home. Floyd narrates how the new star's miraculous appearance, and the message from a mysterious alien power, inspire the American and Soviet leaders to seek peace. Under its infant sun, icy Europa transforms into a humid jungle, covered with life, and watched over by a Monolith.\n\n==Cast==\n<!--- Cast and order per tombstone opening credits, roles per closing credits scroll --->\n{{castlist|\n* [[Roy Scheider]] as Heywood Floyd\n* [[John Lithgow]] as Walter Curnow\n* [[Helen Mirren]] as Tanya Kirbuk\n* [[Bob Balaban]] as R.

[[Candice Bergen]], credited as \"Olga Mallsnerd\", voices the SAL 9000.\n\n[[Arthur C. Clarke]], author of the novels for ''2001'' and ''2010'', appears as a man on a park bench feeding pigeons outside the [[White House]] (visible in the [[letterboxed]] and [[widescreen]] versions). In addition, a ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine cover about the American\u2013Soviet tension is briefly shown, in which the [[President of the United States]] is portrayed by Clarke and the [[Premier of the Soviet Union|Soviet Premier]] by the ''2001'' film's writer, producer and director, [[Stanley Kubrick]].\n\n==Production==\n\n===Development and filming===\nWhen Clarke published his novel ''2010: Odyssey Two'' in 1982, he telephoned Stanley Kubrick, and jokingly said, \"Your job is to stop anybody [from] making it [into a movie] so I won't be bothered.\"<ref name=\"LoBrutto\">{{cite book |last1=LoBrutto |first1=Vincent |title=Stanley Kubrick: A Biography |date=1997 |publisher=D.I.

However, [[Peter Hyams]] was interested and contacted both Clarke and Kubrick for their blessings:\n{{blockquote|I had a long conversation with Stanley and told him what was going on. If it met with his approval, I would do the film; and if it didn't, I wouldn't. I certainly would not have thought of doing the film if I had not gotten the blessing of Kubrick. He's one of my idols; simply one of the greatest talents that's ever walked the Earth. He more or less said, 'Sure. Go do it. I don't care.' And another time he said, 'Don't be afraid. Just go do your own movie.'<ref name=\"LoBrutto\"/>}}\n\nWhile he was writing the screenplay in 1983, Hyams (in [[Los Angeles]]) began communicating with Clarke (in [[Sri Lanka]]) via the then-pioneering medium of e-mail using [[Kaypro|Kaypro II]] computers and direct-dial modems. They discussed the planning and production of the film almost daily using this method, and their informal, often humorous correspondence was published in 1984 as ''The Odyssey File''. As it focuses on the screenwriting and pre-production process, the book terminates on February 7, 1984, just before the movie is about to start filming, though it does include 16 pages of behind-the-scenes photographs from the film.<ref name=\"File\">Arthur C.

The majority of the film was shot on MGM's soundstages in [[Culver City, California]], with the exception of a week of location work in [[Washington, D.C.]], [[Rancho Palos Verdes, California]], and at the [[Very Large Array]] in [[New Mexico]].<ref>{{cite AV media |date= 1984 |title= 2010: The Odyssey Continues |medium=video}}</ref> Originally, Hyams had intended to film the opening scene at the [[Arecibo Observatory]] in [[Puerto Rico]], home of the world's largest radio telescope, but after visiting there in 1983, he told Clarke that the site was \"truly filthy\" and unsuitable for filming.<ref name=\"File\"/>\n\n===Music===\nInitially, [[Tony Banks (musician)|Tony Banks]], keyboardist for the band [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]], was commissioned to do the soundtrack for ''2010: The Year We Make Contact''. However, Banks' material was rejected<ref>[http://www.worldofgenesis.com/TonyBanksInterview2004.htm Tony Banks interview], ''WorldOfGenesis.com''</ref> and [[David Shire]] was then selected to compose the soundtrack, which he co-produced along with [[Craig Huxley]]. The soundtrack album was released by [[A&M Records]].\n\nUnlike many film soundtracks up until then, the soundtrack for ''2010: The Year We Make Contact'' was composed for and played mainly using digital synthesizers. These included the [[Synclavier]] by the [[New England Digital]] company and a [[Yamaha DX1]]. Only two compositions on the soundtrack album feature a symphony orchestra. Shire and Huxley were so impressed by the realistic sound of the Synclavier that they placed a disclaimer in the album's liner notes stating \"No re-synthesis or sampling was employed on the Synclavier.\"<ref>2010 Official Soundtrack Album (cat: AMA 5038). Liner notes: All of the original music, with the exception of \"New Worlds\" and the second half of \"New Worlds Theme\" was entirely synthesized using the New England Digital Synclavier II, Yamaha DX-1 and Roland Jupiter-8. The Blaster Beam was used on \"Reactivating Discovery\". No resynthesis or sampling was employed on the Synclavier. All electronic music was recorded with an Amek 3500 mixing desk and Otari MTR 90 24-track recorder and remixed to a Mitsubishi X-80 digital recorder.</ref>\n\n[[Andy Summers]], guitarist for the band [[The Police]], performed a track entitled \"2010\", which was a modern new-wave pop version of Richard Strauss's ''Also Sprach Zarathustra'' (which had been the main theme from ''2001: A Space Odyssey''). Though Summers' recording was included on the soundtrack album and released as a single, it was not used in the film. For the B-side to the single, Summers recorded another ''2010''-based track entitled \"To Hal and Back\", though this appeared in neither the film nor the soundtrack album.<ref>Andy Summers \"2010\" (AM 2704)</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/Andy-Summers-2010/master/278909|title=Andy Summers - 2010|website=Discogs}}</ref>\n\n==Release==\n\n===Box office===\n''2010: The Year We Make Contact'' debuted at number two at the North American box office, taking $7,393,361 for its opening weekend.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/weekend/chart/?yr=1984&wknd=49&p=.htm|title=Weekend Box Office Results for December 7-9, 1984 - Box Office Mojo|work=boxofficemojo.com}}</ref> It was held off from the top spot by ''[[Beverly Hills Cop]]'', which became that year's highest-grossing film in North America. During its second week, the film faced competition from two other new sci-fi films; John Carpenter's ''[[Starman (film)|Starman]]'' and David Lynch's ''[[Dune (1984 film)|Dune]]'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/weekend/chart/?view=&yr=1984&wknd=50&p=.htm|title=Weekend Box Office Results for December 14-16, 1984 - Box Office Mojo|work=boxofficemojo.com}}</ref> but ultimately outgrossed both by the end of its domestic theatrical run.

It was re-issued (with different artwork) in September 2000. Both releases are presented with the soundtrack remastered in Dolby 5.1 surround sound and in the original 2.35:1 aspect ratio, though a packaging error appears on the 2000 Warner release, claiming that the film is presented in [[Anamorphic DVD|anamorphic widescreen]] when, in reality, it is simply 4:3 letterboxed and not anamorphic (the MGM version of the DVD makes no such claim). The R1 and R4 releases also include the film trailer and a 10-minute ''behind-the-scenes'' featurette ''2010: The Odyssey Continues'' (made at the time of the film's production), though this is not available in other regions.\n\nThe film was released on Blu-ray Disc on April 7, 2009. It features a BD-25 single-layer presentation, now in high-definition 16:9 (2.40:1) widescreen with 1080p/VC-1 video and English Dolby TrueHD 5.1 Surround audio. In all regions, the disc also includes the film's original \"making of\" promotional featurette (as above) and theatrical trailer in standard definition as extras.\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Critical reception===\nCritical reaction to ''2010: The Year We Make Contact'' was generally positive. It holds a 66% \"Fresh\" rating with an average score of 5.78/10 on [[Rotten Tomatoes]], based on 35 reviews. The critical consensus reads, \"''2010'' struggles to escape from the shadow of its monolithic predecessor, but offers brainy adventure in a more straightforward voyage through the cosmos.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/2010_the_year_we_make_contact/ |title=2010: The Year We Make Contact Movie Reviews, Pictures |website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |access-date=2011-02-18}}</ref> [[Roger Ebert]] gave ''2010: The Year We Make Contact'' three stars out of four, writing that \"It doesn't match the poetry and the mystery of the original film, but it does continue the story, and it offers sound, pragmatic explanations for many of the strange and visionary things in ''2001''.\" Ebert also wrote it \"has an ending that is infuriating, not only in its simplicity, but in its inadequacy to fulfill the sense of anticipation, the sense of wonder we felt at the end of ''2001''\". He concluded, however: \"And yet the truth must be told: This is a good movie. Once we've drawn our lines, once we've made it absolutely clear that ''2001'' continues to stand absolutely alone as one of the greatest movies ever made, once we have freed ''2010'' of the comparisons with Kubrick's masterpiece, what we are left with is a good-looking, sharp-edged, entertaining, exciting space opera\".<ref>{{cite news |url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19840101/REVIEWS/401010302/1023 |title=2010 |work=RogerEbert.suntimes.com |access-date=2011-02-18 |date=January 1, 1984 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120513141404/http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F19840101%2FREVIEWS%2F401010302%2F1023 |archive-date=May 13, 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n[[James Berardinelli]] also gave the film three stars out of four, writing that \"''2010'' continues ''2001'' without ruining it.
