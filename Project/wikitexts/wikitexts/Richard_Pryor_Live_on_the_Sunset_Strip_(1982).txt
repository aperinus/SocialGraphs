The film stars and produced by [[Richard Pryor]], who also wrote the film with [[Paul Mooney (comedian)|Paul Mooney]]. The film is released alongside [[Richard Pryor: Live on the Sunset Strip|Pryor's album of the same name]] in 1982, and was the most financially lucrative of the comedian's concert films. The material includes Pryor's frank discussion of his drug addiction and of the night that he caught on fire while [[freebasing]] cocaine in 1980.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Richard Pryor]] as Himself\n* Gene Cross as Stoned Hippie \n* Julie Hampton as Herself \n* [[Jesse Jackson]] as Himself (audience member, uncredited)\n\n==Production==\nThe film cost $4.5 million of which $3 million went to Pryor.<ref name=\"rich\"/>\n\n==Reception==\n''Richard Pryor: Live on the Sunset Strip'' has received positive reviews.

Pryor, on stage, plays the very caricature of the irresponsible black man, the embodiment of almost every single stereotypical trait that traditionally consigned him to the bottom of the country's social order. But he transcends the character. We have had [[Stepin Fetchit]] and [[Butterfly McQueen]] playing seemingly bonafide black idiots. We have had [[Bill Cosby]] and [[Dick Gregory]] \"talking white\" to white audiences. (We have even had [[Flip Wilson]] and [[Redd Foxx]], amiable but insignificant black comics\u2014neither here nor there.) But Richard Pryor for the first time has taken the \u201cblack\u201d character at its socially most regressive, and made us laugh in a new way\u2014as if behind this performance is a high intelligence.<ref name=Grenier>[https://www.commentary.org/articles/richard-grenier/black-comedy/Grenier, Richard, \"Black Comedy,\" ''Commentary'', June 1982.]</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe film grossed $36.3 million, the highest-grossing concert film of all-time until surpassed by ''[[Eddie Murphy Raw]]'' in 1988.<ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=January 13, 1988|page=7|title='Raw' Passes 'Pryor' As Top Concrt Pic}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{IMDb title|0084597|Richard Pryor: Live on the Sunset Strip}}\n* {{rotten-tomatoes|richard_pryor_live_on_sunset_strip}}\n* [https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/richard-pryor-live-on-the-sunset-strip-1982  Roger Ebert's review]\n\n{{Richard Pryor}}\n\n[[Category:1982 films]]\n[[Category:1982 comedy films]]\n[[Category:African-American comedy films]]\n[[Category:African-American films]]\n[[Category:American comedy films]]\n[[Category:Columbia Pictures films]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by Richard Pryor]]\n[[Category:Richard Pryor]]\n[[Category:Stand-up comedy concert films]]\n[[Category:1980s English-language films]]\n[[Category:1980s American films]]\n\n\n{{1980s-comedy-film-stub}}"}]}}}}
