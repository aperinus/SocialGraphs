The film stars most of the same cast from the original, including [[Charlie Sheen]], [[Tom Berenger]], and [[Corbin Bernsen]]. Absent from this film is [[Wesley Snipes]], who played Willie Mays Hayes in the first film and who had become a film star in his own right by 1994. [[Omar Epps]] took over his role. Several new cast members appear in ''Major League II''. [[David Keith (actor)|David Keith]] plays Jack Parkman, a selfish superstar [[catcher]] who is looking to replace the aging Jake Taylor ([[Tom Berenger]]) as the starter. [[Takaaki Ishibashi]], of [[Japan]]ese comedic duo [[Tunnels (owarai)|Tunnels]], is [[outfielder]] Isuro \"Kamikaze\" Tanaka who helps excite the team. [[Eric Bruskotter]] is [[rookie]] catcher Rube Baker who is getting used to the [[Major League Baseball|MLB]] life. Unlike the first film, which was rated R, ''Major League II'' was rated PG and released by [[Warner Bros.]] instead of [[Paramount Pictures]].<!-- DO NOT CHANGE -->\n\n==Plot==\n{{long plot|section|date=September 2018}}\nIn the previous season, the [[Cleveland Guardians|Cleveland Indians]] won the [[American League East|division]] title by beating the [[New York Yankees]] in a one-game playoff, but were defeated in the [[American League Championship Series|ALCS]] by the [[Chicago White Sox]].\n\nThe success of last season has changed the attitudes of the Indians. Pitching sensation Rick \"Wild Thing\" Vaughn has become a media sensation and is now more concerned about his public image than his pitching, causing him to lose the edge on his fastball. Instead, he begins to rely on highly ineffective breaking balls, to which he gives nicknames such as \"Eliminator\" and \"Humiliator.\" Home run hitter Pedro Cerrano becomes a [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] and adopts a more placid, carefree style as opposed to the angry and aggressive player he was before. Center fielder Willie Mays Hayes has become a Hollywood actor and now fancies himself a power hitter, due to a sprained knee he suffered while shooting his new film, a box office flop. Aging catcher and team leader Jake Taylor has also returned, but once again is dealing with injuries to his knees.\n\nRachel Phelps, the owner who previously attempted to sabotage them last season, sells the team to Roger Dorn, who has retired as an active player to take the job. One of his first acts is to sign arrogant [[Oakland Athletics]] all-star catcher Jack Parkman, which forces Jake to compete for his old position. To further complicate things, [[Minor League Baseball|minor-league]] catcher Rube Baker has also been invited to camp despite his inability to throw the ball back to the pitcher with any consistency. As the team breaks camp, manager Lou Brown informs Taylor that he is keeping him on as a coach rather than a player. Jake is upset at first but reluctantly accepts the position.\n\nThe Indians get off to a slow start, with various complications and conflicts between the players. Parkman quickly becomes a divisive figure in the clubhouse due to his ego, for which Lou suspends him after Parkman criticizes the team in the local papers. Parkman then informs Lou that the suspension is moot as he has been traded to the White Sox. Lou confronts Dorn for not consulting him about the trade. Dorn explains that he could no longer afford to pay Parkman's salary and had no choice but to trade him. In return, Japanese import Isuro \"Kamikaze\" Tanaka, a gifted left fielder with a penchant for crashing into the fence, is sent to the Indians.\n\nFinally out of options, Dorn sells the Indians back to Rachel Phelps. Rachel keeps Dorn on as the Indians general manager and his first order of business is to re-activate himself as a player. Phelps bought the team back as revenge for ruining her plan to move the team to Miami. With the Indians now in last place, she has another chance to do so. Lou suffers a heart attack in the clubhouse due to his frustration over the team's performance and Jake takes over in his stead.\n\nWhen Rube is [[Hit by pitch|hit by a pitch]] in his ankle during a doubleheader against the [[Boston Red Sox]], Hayes is called upon to run for him but refuses to do so, which angers Jake. Vaughn quarrels with Hayes and the two begin fighting, which leads to the entire team fighting each other and getting [[Ejection (sports)|ejected]]. After the game, Tanaka criticizes Cerrano for not having any \"marbles\" due to his struggles and Hayes makes a wisecrack at Baker about his injury, leading Rube to chastise Hayes and the rest of the team for their lack of passion. Inspired by the speech, Hayes volunteers to run for the injured Baker in the bottom of the ninth inning of the second game and promptly steals second, third and home to tie the score. Cerrano, also inspired, demands that Jake insert him into the game to pinch hit. As he bats, other players hold bags of marbles to help Cerrano who responds by hitting the [[Walk-off home run|game-winning home run]].\n\nThe win sparks a hot streak that the Indians ride all the way to a second straight division title, clinched by beating the [[Toronto Blue Jays]] on the last day of the season. Despite this, Vaughn continues to slump as his ineffective breaking pitches have caused him to lose confidence in his best pitch, his fastball. To make matters worse, he refuses to finish games he starts and has allowed the heckling fans to get into his head.\n\nIn the ALCS, the Indians meet the White Sox again and win the first three games of the series. This inspires Rachel to give the team a phony pep talk before Game 4, which is purposely designed to get in the heads of the players and distract them. It works, as a still struggling Vaughn gives up a game-winning home run to Parkman in the bottom of the ninth. With strong offense by Parkman, the White Sox defeat the Indians in the next two games, forcing a seventh game in Cleveland. The night before the game, Jake goes to visit Vaughn at his home and tells him that he might be called on to pitch in relief in Game 7. Vaughn nonchalantly tells Taylor he will be ready, which infuriates Jake. He calls Vaughn out for having lost his edge and strongly advises him to find it again before the upcoming game.\n\nThe White Sox jump out to an early 2\u20131 lead in Game 7 after Parkman bowls over Rube on a play at the plate. With the Indians down by one, Hayes reaches base on a walk and taunts Parkman by saying he is going to score on the play without sliding. Rube then lines a drive to the left field corner and Hayes rounds the bases and heads for home. The ball gets to Parkman first, but Hayes, making good on his promise not to slide, leaps over Parkman and lands on home plate, taunting him saying \"I told you I wasn't going to slide.\" Parkman responds, however, by hitting a three-run home run in the seventh inning and the White Sox take a 5\u20133 lead into the bottom of the eighth.\n\nAlthough the Indians get a runner on, two quick outs are recorded and Jake is forced to make a strategic move. He calls upon Dorn to \"take one for the team\" and sends him up to pinch hit. Dorn takes the first pitch off his lower back and is pulled for a pinch runner. Cerrano steps in, having apparently reverted to his more placid self. After taking two pitches, Cerrano's teammates begin shaking little bags of [[Marble (toy)|marble]]s at him. With this, a refocused Cerrano hits a three-run homer to give the Indians a 6\u20135 lead.\n\nHowever, the go-ahead runs reach base with two outs in the top of the ninth. Jake calls on Vaughn to get the final out and to the crowd's delight, Vaughn has taken Jake's message to heart and rediscovered his edge. To further this, he tells Jake that he intends to walk the current batter and pitch to Parkman instead, who is on deck. Knowing that an intentional walk will load the bases, Jake initially balks but takes confidence in Vaughn and allows him to face Parkman. Vaughn then strikes out Parkman, sending the Indians to the [[World Series]].\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Charlie Sheen]] as Rick \"Wild Thing\" Vaughn\n* [[Tom Berenger]] as Jake Taylor\n* [[Corbin Bernsen]] as Roger Dorn\n* [[Dennis Haysbert]] as Pedro Cerrano\n* [[James Gammon]] as Lou Brown\n* [[Omar Epps]] as Willie Mays Hayes\n* [[Bob Uecker]] as Harry Doyle\n* [[David Keith (actor)|David Keith]] as Jack Parkman\n* [[Takaaki Ishibashi]] as Isuro \"Kamikaze\" Tanaka\n* [[Margaret Whitton]] as Rachel Phelps\n* [[Eric Bruskotter]] as Rube Baker\n* [[Alison Doody]] as Rebecca Flannery\n* [[Michelle Burke]] as Nicki Reese\n* [[Rene Russo]] as Lynn Wells\n* [[Jay Leno]] as himself\n* [[Randy Quaid]] as Johnny\n* [[Richard Schiff]] as a commercial director\n* [[Jesse Ventura]] as himself\n* [[Steve Yeager]] as Coach Duke Temple\n* [[Kevin Hickey]] as Schoup\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Reception==\n===Box office===\nThe movie debuted at [[List of 1994 box office number-one films in the United States|number 1 at the US box office]], knocking out ''[[D2: The Mighty Ducks]]'', another sports comedy featuring ''Major League'' star Charlie Sheen's brother, [[Emilio Estevez]].<ref>{{cite news|title= Weekend Box Office : A Good Turnout for 'Four Weddings' |work= The Los Angeles Times|url= https://articles.latimes.com/1994-04-12/entertainment/ca-45151_1_weekend-box-office|access-date=2011-01-01}}</ref> In the [[United States]] and Canada, the movie grossed a total of $30,626,182 at the box office.<ref>{{cite web|title=Major League II (1994)- Movie Info- Yahoo!

[[Oriole Park at Camden Yards]] in Baltimore replaced [[Milwaukee County Stadium]] as the stand-in for the team's home. Although Oriole Park bore a stronger resemblance to the stadium that the Indians were playing in when ''Major League II'' was released (the now-[[Progressive Field]]), like Milwaukee County Stadium it was designed to represent Cleveland Stadium in the film as the new ballpark was not yet named at the time of the filming.  The outfield scoreboard at Oriole Park reads \"Welcome to Cleveland Stadium\" at various points and scenes in the outfield are played in front of a blue wall, which Cleveland Stadium had (Oriole Park and Progressive Field both have dark green outfield walls). In one scene, a sign for the \"Sheraton Inner Harbor\" can be seen above an outfielder's head. The Sheraton Inner Harbor is a hotel located in Baltimore's Inner Harbor, not Cleveland.\n\nA year after this film was released, the actual [[1995 Cleveland Indians season|Cleveland Indians]] team made it to the [[1995 World Series]], which was the team's first playoff appearance in 41 years. The Indians ended up losing in six games to the [[1995 Atlanta Braves season|Atlanta Braves]]. In the lead-up to Game 3, the first World Series game played in Cleveland in 41 years, the public address system played \"The House Is Rockin\", the song from the end of ''Major League II''. In another coincidence, [[Bob Uecker]] served as a commentator for the 1995 World Series television coverage on [[Major League Baseball on NBC|NBC]], which [[The Baseball Network|shared broadcasting rights]] with rival network [[Major League Baseball on ABC|ABC]], thanks to a [[1994\u201395 Major League Baseball strike|strike]] that cancelled the final two months of the [[1994 Major League Baseball season|1994 season]], as well as the postseason and [[1994 World Series|World Series]]. Two years after that, the [[1997 Cleveland Indians season|Indians]] made it to the [[1997 World Series|World Series]] again (also telecast by NBC and again with Uecker as a commentator) ended up with the same result, this time losing to the [[1997 Florida Marlins season|Florida Marlins]] in seven games. It would be 19 years before the [[2016 Cleveland Indians season|Indians]] returned to the [[2016 World Series|World Series]] (this time broadcast on [[Major League Baseball on Fox|Fox]]), which they would once again lose in seven games to the [[2016 Chicago Cubs season|Chicago Cubs]]; this came a mere four months after the city's [[National Basketball Association|NBA]] team, the [[2015-16 Cleveland Cavaliers season|Cavaliers]], had defeated the heavily-favored [[2015-16 Golden State Warriors season|Golden State Warriors]] in the [[2016 NBA Finals|NBA Finals]] that also went seven games, and brought an end to a [[Cleveland sports curse|52-year championship drought]].\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Portal|Baseball|Film}}\n{{wikiquote}}\n* {{IMDb title|0110442}}\n* {{Rotten-tomatoes|id=major_league_2}}\n* {{amg movie|133495}}\n* {{tcmdb title|id=824491}}\n\n{{David S.
