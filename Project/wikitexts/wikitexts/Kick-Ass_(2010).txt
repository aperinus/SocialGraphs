It is based on the [[Kick-Ass (comic book)|comic book of the same name]]{{efn|name=BookOne|Later retitled to ''Book One'' of ''Kick-Ass: The Dave Lizewski Years''}} by [[Mark Millar]] and [[John Romita, Jr.]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.allmovie.com/movie/v468124|title=Kick-Ass (2010) - Matthew Vaughn {{!}} Synopsis, Characteristics, Moods, Themes and Related|website=[[AllMovie]]|language=en-us|access-date=2020-03-14}}</ref>\n\nIt tells the story of an ordinary teenager, [[Kick-Ass (character)|Dave Lizewski]] ([[Aaron Taylor-Johnson|Aaron Johnson]]), who sets out to become a [[real-life superhero]], calling himself \"Kick-Ass\". Dave gets caught up in a bigger fight when he meets Big Daddy ([[Nicolas Cage]]), a former cop who, in his quest to bring down the crime boss Frank D'Amico ([[Mark Strong]]) and his son Red Mist ([[Christopher Mintz-Plasse]]), has trained his eleven-year-old daughter ([[Chlo\u00eb Grace Moretz]]) to be the ruthless vigilante [[Hit-Girl]].\n\n<!-- NOTE: Intro summarizes article. There is no need to repeat the citations again here so long as they are verifiable in the article. See [[Wikipedia:LEAD#Citations]] -->\nThe film was released in the United Kingdom on 26 March 2010, by [[Universal Pictures]], and in the United States on 16 April, by [[Lionsgate Films|Lionsgate]]. Despite having generated some controversy for its profanity and violence performed by a child, ''Kick-Ass'' was well received by both critics and audiences. In 2011 it won the [[Empire Award]] for [[Empire Award for Best British Film|Best British Film]]. The film has gained a strong [[cult following]] since its release on [[DVD]] and [[Blu-ray Disc|Blu-ray]].\n\nA [[Kick-Ass 2 (film)|sequel]], written and directed by [[Jeff Wadlow]] and produced by Vaughn, was released in August 2013, with Johnson, Mintz-Plasse, and Moretz reprising their roles. In 2018, Vaughn announced his intentions to reboot the series.\n\n==Plot==\n[[Kick-Ass (character)|Dave Lizewski]] is an ordinary teenager who lives in [[Staten Island, New York]]. Inspired by comic books, Dave plans to become a real-life superhero. He purchases and modifies a scuba diving suit and arms himself with batons. During his first outing, he gets stabbed and hit by a car. After recovering, he gains a capacity to endure pain and enhanced durability due to having some bones replaced with metal. In his absence from school, a rumor spreads that he is gay. As a result, his longtime crush, Katie Deauxma, immediately attempts to become his friend. Unhappy with the misunderstanding, Dave nevertheless appreciates the opportunity to get closer to Katie. \n\nDave returns to crime-fighting and gains notoriety after saving a man from a gang attack. Calling himself \"Kick-Ass\", he sets up a [[Myspace]] account where he can be contacted for help. Responding to a request from Katie, he confronts a drug dealer, Rasul, who has been harassing her. At Rasul's place, Kick-Ass is quickly overwhelmed by Rasul's thugs. Before they can kill him, two costumed vigilantes, [[Hit-Girl]] and her father, Big Daddy, intervene, easily slaughter the thugs and leave with their money. After coming home, Dave realizes he is in over his head and plans to give up crime-fighting. However, Hit-Girl and Big Daddy pay him a visit and encourage him. \n\nBig Daddy's real identity is Damon Macready, formerly an honest cop. Framed by Mafia boss Frank D'Amico, he was jailed. His wife committed suicide, leaving behind his daughter Mindy. Against the protest of his former partner Marcus Williams, Damon trains himself and Mindy as preparation for getting revenge on Frank. They have been undermining Frank's operations by raiding his warehouses, robbing his money and destroying his drugs. Frank believes Kick-Ass is responsible for the attacks and targets him, though he mistakenly kills a party entertainer who is dressed like Kick-Ass. Frank's son Chris suggests a different approach and poses himself as a new vigilante named \"Red Mist\" and befriends Kick-Ass. \n\nChris plans to lure Kick-Ass into Frank's lumber warehouse and unmask him. However, they find the warehouse on fire and Frank's men dead. Red Mist retrieves a hidden camera he earlier placed in the warehouse, and he sees recorded footage of Big Daddy killing the men and burning the warehouse. Red Mist and Kick-Ass part ways. Frank watches the footage and learns of Big Daddy. Following the event, Dave decides to quit being Kick-Ass. He reveals his identity to Katie and clears up the misunderstanding about him being gay. She forgives him and becomes his girlfriend. However, Red Mist contacts him again and tricks him into revealing Big Daddy and Hit-Girl's location. \n\nAt one of Big Daddy's safe houses, Red Mist shoots Hit-Girl out of a window, and Frank's men capture Big Daddy and Kick-Ass. Frank intends to have his thugs torture and execute his captives in a live Internet broadcast. While Kick-Ass and Big Daddy are being beaten by Frank's gangsters, Hit-Girl, having survived the shooting, storms the hideout and kills all of the gangsters. During the fight, one thug sets Big Daddy on fire. Big Daddy and Mindy say a tearful farewell before he dies of his burns. Kick-Ass and Hit-Girl resolve to defeat Frank D'Amico once and for all. Hit-Girl infiltrates Frank's headquarters and kills numerous guards and henchmen before running out of bullets. \n\nWhen Hit-Girl is cornered by the thugs, Kick-Ass arrives on a jet pack fitted with miniguns and kills the remaining thugs. Kick-Ass and Hit-Girl then take on Frank and Red Mist. Kick-Ass fights Red Mist, which results in them knocking each other out. Frank overpowers an exhausted Hit-Girl. Before he can kill her, Kick-Ass regains consciousness and blasts Frank out of the window with a bazooka, killing him. Red Mist then regains consciousness, grabs his father's Samurai sword and pursues Kick-Ass in order to continue their fight just in time to see Kick-Ass and Hit Girl fly away on the jet pack. \n\nDave and Mindy retire from crime-fighting; Marcus becomes Mindy's guardian, and she enrolls at Dave's school. Meanwhile, Chris sits in his father's office, dressed in an upgraded suit, preparing to seek his revenge on Kick-Ass for killing his father. Facing the camera, he says, \"as a great man once said, wait'll they get a load of me\", before firing a gun at the screen.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Aaron Taylor-Johnson|Aaron Johnson]] as [[Kick-Ass (character)|Dave Lizewski / Kick-Ass]]\n* [[Christopher Mintz-Plasse]] as Chris D\u2019Amico / Red Mist\n* [[Mark Strong]] as Frank D\u2019Amico\n* [[Chlo\u00eb Grace Moretz]] as [[Hit-Girl|Mindy Macready / Hit-Girl]]\n* [[Nicolas Cage]] as Damon Macready / Big Daddy\n* [[Lyndsy Fonseca]] as Katie Deauxma\n* [[Clark Duke]] as Marty Eisenberg\n* [[Evan Peters]] as Todd Haynes\n* [[Sophie Wu]] as Erika Cho\n* [[Omari Hardwick]] as Sergeant Marcus Williams\n* Stu Riley as Huge Goon\n* [[Michael Rispoli]] as Big Joe\n* [[Dexter Fletcher]] as Cody\n* [[Jason Flemyng]] as Lobby Goon\n* [[Xander Berkeley]] as Detective Gigante\n* Kofi Natei as Rasul\n* [[Corey Johnson (actor)|Corey Johnson]] as Sporty Goon\n* [[Adrian Martinez (actor)|Adrian Martinez]] as Ginger Goon\n* Katrena Rochell as Female Junkie\n* Omar Soriano as Leroy\n* [[Garrett M.
