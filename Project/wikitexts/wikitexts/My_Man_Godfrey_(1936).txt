Hatch]]. The story concerns a socialite who hires a derelict to be her family's butler, and then falls in love with him.\n\nIn 1999, the original version of ''My Man Godfrey'' was deemed \"culturally significant\" by the United States [[Library of Congress]] and selected for preservation in the [[National Film Registry]]. The film was [[My Man Godfrey (1957 film)|remade in 1957]] with [[June Allyson]] and [[David Niven]] in the starring roles.\n\n==Plot==\nDuring the [[Great Depression]], Godfrey \"Smith\" Parke is unemployed, living with other homeless men down on their luck at a New York City dump in a [[Hooverville]] on the East River near the [[59th Street Bridge]]. One night, a spoiled socialite named Cornelia Bullock offers him $5 to be her \"[[forgotten man]]\" for a [[scavenger hunt]]. The annoyed Godfrey refuses, causing Cornelia to retreat and fall on a pile of ashes, much to the glee of her younger sister and rival Irene. After talking with Irene, Godfrey finds her to be kind and offers to go with her to help her beat Cornelia, as well as satisfy his own curiosity regarding their scavenger hunt.\n\nIn the ballroom of the Waldorf-Ritz Hotel, Irene's businessman father Alexander Bullock waits resignedly as his wife Angelica and her mooching prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Carlo play the game. Godfrey arrives and is authenticated as a \"forgotten man\", allowing Irene to win the game. However, Godfrey takes the opportunity to address his contempt for the audience's antics before leaving in a huff. Realizing what she brought him into, an apologetic Irene offers Godfrey to be her prot\u00e9g\u00e9 by hiring him as the new family butler, which he gratefully accepts.\n\nOn his first day as the new butler, Godfrey is warned by the Bullocks' maid Molly that he is merely the latest in a long line of butlers who didn't last long due to the Bullocks' conflicting personalities and antics. Despite this, Godfrey proves to be surprisingly competent and resourceful in his duties, but Cornelia holds a grudge against him, intending to get him in trouble and have him dumped back into the streets. In the meantime, Irene proves herself to be far kinder and more empathetic than her family, particularly her sister, but just as spoiled and altogether na\u00efve, becoming infatuated with Godfrey through no more than basic interaction and general allure. She even goes as far as to kiss him, causing a job-anxious Godfrey to politely but firmly outline the boundaries of their employee-employer relationship.\n\nEventually, Godfrey is recognized by his longtime friend Tommy Gray at a tea party thrown by Irene. Godfrey makes up a story that he was Tommy's valet at Harvard, to which Tommy plays along by embellishing Godfrey's story with a nonexistent wife and five children. Upon hearing this, a dismayed Irene impulsively announces her engagement to the surprised Charlie Van Rumple but breaks down in tears and flees after being congratulated by Godfrey. Over lunch the next day, Tommy is curious to know what one of the elite \"Parkes of Boston\" is doing as a servant. Godfrey explains that a broken love affair left him broke and considering suicide, but the undaunted attitude of the homeless men living at the dump rekindled his spirits.\n\nEventually, Irene breaks her engagement with Charlie. Cornelia attempts to seduce Godfrey on his day off, but when he rebuffs her, she plants her pearl necklace under Godfrey's mattress and calls the police, intending to have him arrested. However, the police couldn't find the pearls inside the mattress, and Mr. Bullock (having deduced what Cornelia did) furiously informed Cornelia that the pearls are not insured and that she will lose a great deal of money if she doesn't find the necklace, distressing her. The Bullocks send their daughters to Europe to get Irene away from her now-broken engagement, but when they return, Cornelia implies that she intends to seduce Godfrey again. A worried Irene stages a fainting spell and swoons into Godfrey's arms, but he rebuffs her after realizing that she's faking. Having enough of Irene's behavior, Godfrey announces his resignation as the butler.\n\nBefore Godfrey is about to leave, Mr. Bullock throws Carlo out (literally), and announces to the family that their business is failing and that he tried to recoup the losses with his stockholders' money behind their backs, which will land him in prison on embezzlement charges and leave the rest of the family penniless. However, Godfrey provides good news: he had [[Short (finance)|sold short]], using some of the money raised by pawning Cornelia's pearl necklace to buy up the stock that Bullock had sold. He gives the stock back to Mr. Bullock, saving the family from financial ruin. Godfrey also returns the necklace to Cornelia, who concedes defeat by confessing to planting the necklace in the mattress and humbly expressing her gratitude and remorse for her behavior. As Godfrey leaves, the grateful Molly and the Bullocks are saddened to see him go, but Irene is determined to follow him.\n\nWith Godfrey's remaining profits, Godfrey and Tommy become business partners as they convert the now-filled-in dump into a fashionable nightclub called \"The Dump\", creating new jobs for the other homeless men, with a housing plan for new [[Single room occupancy|SRO]] apartments for them. Upon hearing of Godfrey's new occupation during The Dump's grand opening, a determined Irene finds Godfrey and convinces him to marry her by persuading the Mayor (who is the guest of honor) to perform a civil wedding while her chauffeur serves as a witness.\n\n==Cast==\n[[Image:My Man Godfrey.jpg|thumb|right|285px|[[Eugene Pallette]], [[Mischa Auer]] and [[Alice Brady]] in ''My Man Godfrey'']]\n\n* [[William Powell]] as Godfrey \n* [[Carole Lombard]] as Irene Bullock\n* [[Alice Brady]] as Angelica Bullock\n* [[Gail Patrick]] as Cornelia Bullock\n* [[Jean Dixon]] as Molly\n* [[Eugene Pallette]] as Alexander Bullock\n* [[Alan Mowbray]] as Tommy Gray\n* [[Mischa Auer]] as Carlo\n* [[Pat Flaherty (actor)|Pat Flaherty]] as Mike Flaherty\n* Robert Light as Faithful George\n* [[Fred Coby]] as Investigator\n* [[Grady Sutton]] as Charlie Van Rumple ''(uncredited)''\n* [[Franklin Pangborn]] as Scavenger Hunt Judge ''(uncredited)''\n*[[Bess Flowers]] as Mrs. Merriweather ''(uncredited)''\n* Grace Field as a socialite ''(uncredited)''\n* [[Jane Wyman]] as a socialite ''(uncredited)''\n\n==Production==\nThe film was based on a 1935 novel by Eric S.

Rogers|Charles Rogers]], head of Universal, called it \"a sure-fire laugh-getting novel\".

However the studio did not have any major stars under contract apart from [[Buck Jones]], [[Boris Karloff]] and [[Edward Everett Horton]], and needed to borrow some from other studios.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Associated Press|author-link=Associated Press|title=Star Scarcity Still Is Acute Studio Problem: Only Fifty Real Winners in Harness and That Is Not Enough|date=August 24, 1936|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|page=X9}}</ref>\n\nThe studio's original choice to play Irene, the part eventually played by [[Carole Lombard]], was [[Constance Bennett]], and [[Miriam Hopkins]] also was considered, but the director [[Gregory La Cava]] would only agree to Bennett if [[Universal Pictures|Universal]] borrowed William Powell from [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]]. Powell, for his part, only would take the role if Carole Lombard played Irene.

When he and Powell hit a snag over a disagreement about how Godfrey should be portrayed, they settled things over a bottle of Scotch. The next morning, La Cava showed up for shooting with a headache, but Powell didn't appear. Instead, the actor sent a telegram stating: \"WE MAY HAVE FOUND GODFREY LAST NIGHT BUT WE LOST POWELL.

Considering the end of the film, however, he notes that \"the social conscience is a little confused\" and he wishes for a more \"dignified exit\".<ref>{{cite news|last= Greene|first= Graham|author-link= Graham Greene|date= October 2, 1936|title= Maria Bashkirtseff/My Man Godfrey|newspaper= [[The Spectator]]}} (reprinted in: {{cite book|editor-last= Taylor|editor-first= John Russell|editor-link= John Russell Taylor|date= 1980|title= The Pleasure Dome|url= https://archive.org/details/pleasuredomegrah00gree/page/104|pages= [https://archive.org/details/pleasuredomegrah00gree/page/104 104\u2013106]|isbn= 0192812866}})</ref>\n\n== Awards and honors ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=\"95%\"\n|-\n! width=\"5%\"| Year\n! width=\"25%\"| Award ceremony\n! width=\"40%\"| Category\n! width=\"20%\"| Nominee\n! width=\"10%\"| Result\n|-\n|rowspan=\"6\"|1937\n|rowspan=\"6\"|[[9th Academy Awards|Academy Awards]]<ref name=\"oscars\">[http://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/1937 \"The 9th Academy Awards (1937) Nominees and Winners.\"] Academy Awards website.
