In a major change, it stars [[Ving Rhames]] as an outsider who comes into Rosewood and inspires residents to self-defense, wielding his pistols in a fight. The supporting cast includes [[Don Cheadle]] as Sylvester Carrier, a resident who was a witness, defender of his family and victim of the riot; and [[Jon Voight]] as John Wright, a sympathetic white store owner who lives in Rosewood. The three characters become entangled in an attempt to save people from racist White people attacking the blacks of Rosewood.\n\nDespite generally favorable reviews the film was not a commercial success, and was unable to recoup its $17 million budget at the box office. The film was entered into the [[47th Berlin International Film Festival]].<ref name=\"Berlinale\">{{cite web |url=http://www.berlinale.de/en/archiv/jahresarchive/1997/02_programm_1997/02_Programm_1997.html |title=Berlinale: 1997 Programme |access-date=2012-01-12 |work=berlinale.de}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nMann is a mysterious [[World War I]] veteran who is scouting out land to buy. He comes to the town of [[Rosewood, Florida|Rosewood]], a small and predominantly black town in [[Florida]]. Rosewood is home to the Carriers, an upwardly mobile black family, led by a matriarch, Aunt Sarah and her proud, headstrong son, Sylvester. Mann soon meets Beulah \"Scrappie\" Carrier, Sylvester's young cousin and the two quickly fall in love.\n\nAunt Sarah works as a housekeeper for James Taylor and his wife, Fanny, a white couple who lives in the white side of Rosewood. Fanny, who has a history of cheating her husband, has a rendezvous with her lover while her husband is at work. Fanny argues with her lover, who ends up beating her. Aunt Sarah and her granddaughter, Lee Ruth, overhear the argument and the subsequent beating but do not intervene. A distraught Fanny, despairing of explaining her injuries to her husband, leaves her house and calls for help. She then tells several townspeople that she has been beaten by a black man. The white residents readily believe Fanny's claim. Hearing of an escaped black [[convict]] named Jesse Hunter, a [[Posse comitatus|posse]] from Sumner and nearby towns goes to Rosewood to investigate. The black residents of Rosewood are quickly targeted by a white mob, including men from out of state and members of the [[Ku Klux Klan]].\n\nAs a stranger, Mann is afraid that he will be accused of attacking Fanny and [[lynching|lynch]]ed. He plans to leave town over the protests of several Rosewood residents who have met in church to discuss plans to defend their community. Outside the church, Mann clashes with John Wright, a [[United States Navy|Navy]] [[Spanish American War]] veteran and the owner of a general store, one of the few white residents of Rosewood. Wright is also engaging in a torrid extramarital affair with Sylvester's cousin, Jewel; Mann leaves.\n\nWhen the posse arrives at the Carrier home, Aunt Sarah attempts to placate the angry crowd. When she announces that Fanny Taylor's attacker had been a white man, someone in the crowd shoots her and she dies of her injuries. The posse comes and Sylvester shoots and kills two of its members. The posse falls back and a shootout erupts. After Aunt Sarah's murder, the posse attacks Rosewood. Mann is on his way out of town when he witnesses the lynching of Sam Carter, the blacksmith. Changing his mind about leaving, Mann returns to Rosewood to fight alongside the residents. Some decent white men who live in Rosewood help black Rosewood residents escape. Railroad conductors smuggle people out of town on trains. Wright asks the train conductors to pick up the women and children while his wife hides several other African-Americans in their home. Other whites attempt to stop the violence with no success.\n\nThe posse swells in number. Believing that James Carrier held information about the escaped convict, they seek him out. After making an unsuccessful attempt to intervene on James' behalf, Wright reluctantly allows Sheriff Walker to take Carrier into custody because the officer said he only wanted to question him. When Carrier says he doesn't have any information, he is immediately shot by one of the members of the mob. Wright gets upset and the mob accuses him of being soft on blacks.\n\nThe violence escalates and spills out into neighboring towns. When the posse gets to the border of Alachua County, a group of armed deputized white men and a sheriff block the roads and turn them back. Surviving members of the Carrier family eventually escape on a train, which had been arranged by Wright. Scrappie and Mann finally share a kiss before Mann departs with Sylvester. The two plan to meet up later. After the violence dies down, James Taylor confronts his wife, Fanny. He realizes that Fanny has lied to him about the true cause of her injuries and had affairs with other men, after being told by the sheriff and the townspeople. Officially the final death toll was eight people, two white and six black. Other accounts by survivors and several African-American newspapers estimated a higher death toll.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Ving Rhames]] as Mann\n*[[Don Cheadle]] as Sylvester Carrier\n*[[Jon Voight]] as John Wright\n*[[Bruce McGill]] as Duke Purdy\n*[[Loren Dean]] as James Taylor\n*[[Esther Rolle]] as Aunt Sarah\n*[[Elise Neal]] as Beulah (Scrappie)\n*Bridgid Coulter as Gertrude\n*[[Robert Patrick]] as Fanny's Lover\n*[[Michael Rooker]] as Sheriff Walker\n*[[Catherine Kellner]] as Fanny Taylor\n*[[Akosua Busia]] as Jewel\n*[[Paul Benjamin]] as James Carrier\n*Kevin Jackson as Sam Carter\n*[[Mark Boone Junior]] as Poly\n*[[Muse Watson]] as Henry Andrews\n*[[Badja Djola]] as John Bradley\n*Kathryn Meisle as Mary Wright\n*[[Jaimz Woolvett]] as Deputy Earl\n*[[Vanessa Baden]] as Lee-Ruth\n*Andrew \"JR\" Tarver as The Preacher\n\n==Production==\nMinnie Lee Langley, a survivor, served as a source for the set designers, and Arnett Doctor, son of a survivor, was hired as a consultant.<ref name=\"persall\"/><ref name=\"sylbert\">\"Raising 'Rosewood'\", ''TCI'' (March 1997), pp. 40\u201343.</ref> Recreated sets of the towns of Rosewood and Sumner were built in Central Florida, far away from Levy County, where the events took place. The film version, written by screenwriter [[Gregory Poirier]], created a character named Mann, who enters Rosewood as a type of reluctant Western-style hero. Composites of historic figures were used as characters, and the film offers the possibility of a happy ending.\n\nAsked about why he decided to tackle this subject, Singleton said: \"I had a very deep\u2014I wouldn't call it fear\u2014but a deep contempt for the [[Southern United States|South]] because I felt that so much of the horror and evil that black people have faced in this country is rooted here&nbsp;...

What makes it more is the way it shows how racism breeds and feeds, and is taught by father to son. ... it's not easily summarized in ads and does not obviously appeal to either blacks (since it documents such a depressing chapter) or whites (depicted as murderous or ineffectual).

Color, class and sex were woven together on a level that [[William Faulkner|Faulkner]] would have appreciated.\"<ref>Crouch, Stanley (August 26, 2001). \"[https://www.nytimes.com/2001/08/26/movies/film-a-lost-generation-and-its-exploiters.html?sec=&spon=&pagewanted=all Film; A Lost Generation and its Exploiters]\", ''[[The New York Times]]''. Retrieved on April 17, 2009.</ref>\n\n[[E.R. Shipp]] in ''The New York Times'' suggests that Singleton's youth and his background in California contributed to his willingness to take on the story of Rosewood. She notes Singleton's rejection of the image of blacks as victims and portrayal of \"an idyllic past in which black families are intact, loving and prosperous, and a black superhero who changes the course of history when he escapes the noose, takes on the mob with double-barreled ferocity and saves many women and children from death\".<ref name=\"shipp\" /> Shipp commented on Singleton's creating a fictional account of Rosewood events, saying that the film \"assumes a lot and then makes up a lot more\".<ref name=\"shipp\">Shipp, E. R. (March 16, 1997). \"Film View: Taking Control of Old Demons by Forcing Them Into the Light\", ''The New York Times'', p. 13.</ref>  The film version alludes to many more deaths than the highest counts by eyewitnesses. Journalist Gary Moore, who reported the events in 1982, breaking open decades of silence, believed that Singleton's creating Mann, an outside character who inspires the citizens of Rosewood to fight back, was condescending to survivors. He also criticized the inflated death toll, saying the film was \"an interesting experience in illusion\".<ref name=\"persall\">Persall, Steve, (February 17, 1997) \"A Burning Issue\", ''The St. Petersburg Times'', p. 1D.</ref>\n\nIn retrospect, Gregory Poirier, who wrote the film said: \u201cRosewood didn\u2019t do much box office. The reviews were generally good, and Siskel and Ebert raved about it, but John [Singleton] was right; it was in many ways too difficult to watch, a chapter of American\nhistory most Americans don\u2019t want to be confronted with.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2020/07/john-singleton-rosewood-reminiscence-screenwriter-gregory-poirier-1202983660/|title = John Singleton and the Making of 'Rosewood:' Screenwriter Gregory Poirier on Memories & Regrets|date = 12 July 2020}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* ''[[Banished (film)|Banished]]''\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n*D'Orso, Michael.
