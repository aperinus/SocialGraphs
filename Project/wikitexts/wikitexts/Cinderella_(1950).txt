Based on the [[fairy tale]] [[Cinderella|of the same name]] by [[Charles Perrault]], it is the [[List of Walt Disney Animation Studios films|12th Disney animated feature film]]. The film was directed by [[Wilfred Jackson]], [[Hamilton Luske]], and [[Clyde Geronimi]]. [[Mack David]], [[Jerry Livingston]], and [[Al Hoffman]] wrote the songs, which include \"Cinderella\", \"[[A Dream Is a Wish Your Heart Makes]]\", \"Oh, Sing Sweet Nightingale\", \"The Work Song\", \"[[Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Boo]]\", and \"[[So This is Love (Cinderella song)|So This is Love]]\". It features the voices of [[Ilene Woods]], [[Eleanor Audley]], [[Verna Felton]], [[Rhoda Williams]], [[Jimmy MacDonald (sound effects artist)|James MacDonald]], [[Luis van Rooten]], [[Don Barclay (actor)|Don Barclay]], [[Mike Douglas]], [[William Edward Phipps|William Phipps]], and [[Lucille Bliss]].\n\nDuring the early 1940s, [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Walt Disney Productions]] had suffered financially after losing connections to the European film markets due to the outbreak of [[World War II]]. Because of this, the studio endured [[box office bomb]]s such as ''[[Pinocchio (1940 film)|Pinocchio]]'' (1940), ''[[Fantasia (1940 film)|Fantasia]]'' (1940), and ''[[Bambi]]'' (1942), all of which would later become more successful with several re-releases in theaters and on home video. By 1947, the studio was over $4 million in debt and was on the verge of bankruptcy. Walt Disney and his animators returned to feature film production in 1948 after producing a string of [[anthology film|package films]] with the idea of adapting Charles Perrault's ''[[Cinderella#Cendrillon ou la petite pantoufle de Verre, by Perrault|Cendrillon]]'' into an animated film.<ref name=mf>{{cite web|title=25 Things You Never Knew About Disney's 'Cinderella'|url=https://www.moviefone.com/2015/02/15/disney-cinderella-facts/|website=Moviefone|access-date=August 22, 2017|date=February 15, 2015}}</ref>\n\nAfter two years in production, ''Cinderella'' was released by [[RKO Pictures|RKO Radio Pictures]] on February 15, 1950.

This article is currently at 681.  -->\nWhen [[Cinderella (Disney character)|Cinderella]] is a young girl, her widowed father marries [[Lady Tremaine]], a widow with two daughters of her own. He dies shortly thereafter. Lady Tremaine, jealous of her stepdaughter's beauty and determined to forward her own daughters' interests, orders Cinderella to become a [[Domestic worker|scullion]] in her own [[ch\u00e2teau]], overburdening her with chores. Cinderella's stepsisters, [[Anastasia Tremaine|Anastasia]] and [[Drizella Tremaine|Drizella]], also take advantage of her meekness, mocking her and adding to her workload. Despite this, Cinderella remains kind of heart, obediently doing her chores whilst taking care of the mice and birds that live in the ch\u00e2teau, making friends of them, mainly of two mice named [[Jaq and Gus]]. She also protects them from being eaten by her stepmother's cat [[List of Disney's Cinderella characters#Lucifer|Lucifer]], who makes her duties even harder in retaliation.\n\nOne day, the local King becomes impatient for his son to provide him with grandchildren. Despite the objections of the [[List of Disney's Cinderella characters#The Grand Duke|Grand Duke]], the King invites all the eligible maidens in the kingdom to a [[Ball (dance party)|royal ball]], so that the Prince will choose one as his wife. Wanting to attend, Cinderella finds a dress of her late mother's to fix up. Her stepmother and stepsisters, afraid she will upstage them at the ball, deliberately keep her busy with no time to spare. Jaq, Gus, and the other animals decide to fix up the dress for Cinderella, using beads and a sash discarded by the stepsisters. However, when Cinderella attempts to go to the ball with her family, her stepsisters recognize their belongings and angrily tear the dress into rags, before leaving Cinderella behind.\n\nA distraught Cinderella storms out to the garden in tears, kneeling by a stone bench. There, she is met by her [[List of Disney's Cinderella characters#The Fairy Godmother|Fairy Godmother]], who has come to help. She transforms Jaq, Gus, and two other mice into four white horses, a pumpkin into a coach, and Cinderella's old horse Major and [[bloodhound]] Bruno into a [[coachman]] and [[footman]], respectively. The fairy godmother also gives Cinderella a shimmering ball gown and glass slippers, but warns her that the magic will all end on the stroke of midnight.\n\nCinderella arrives at the ball, and is not recognized by her stepsisters, though her stepmother believes something is familiar about her. The Prince is instantly smitten, so the King orders the Grand Duke to make sure the romance goes without a hitch. The Duke prevents anyone from interfering as Cinderella and the Prince dance a waltz and wander out to the palace grounds, falling deeper in love. However, when Cinderella hears the [[Striking clock|clock tolling]] midnight, she runs away before she and the Prince can exchange names. Despite the efforts of the Grand Duke, Cinderella flees the palace, losing one of her slippers on the staircase. The palace guards pursue, but when the magic ends on the stroke of 12, Cinderella and the animals revert to their former appearances and hide in the woods. Cinderella discovers the other glass slipper is still on her foot, and takes it home with her.\n\nThe Prince promises he will marry none but the girl who fits the glass slipper. Elated, the King orders the Grand Duke to try the shoe on every girl in the kingdom until he finds a match. When the news reaches the chateau, Cinderella is shocked to realize it was the Prince she met. Hearing Cinderella humming the waltz from the ball, Lady Tremaine realizes the truth and locks Cinderella in her [[attic]] bedroom. While the stepsisters unsuccessfully try on the slipper, Jaq and Gus steal the key back from Lady Tremaine. As they take the key to Cinderella, Lucifer attempts to stop them by trapping Gus and battling the other mice. The birds summon Bruno, who scares Lucifer out of the house, and a freed Cinderella hurries to meet the Grand Duke.\n\nIn a last effort to prevent Cinderella from overshadowing her daughters, Lady Tremaine causes a [[page (servant)|page]] to trip and break the glass slipper. Cinderella reveals she has the other slipper, which the Grand Duke places on her foot, much to Lady Tremaine's shock. Cinderella and the Prince are married, and share a kiss as they set off in a carriage for their honeymoon.\n\n== Cast ==\n*[[Ilene Woods]] (voice); [[Helene Stanley]] (live-action model) as [[Cinderella (Disney character)|Cinderella]]\n*[[Eleanor Audley]] as [[Lady Tremaine]]\n*[[Verna Felton]] (voice); [[Claire Du Brey]] (live-action model) as the [[Fairy Godmother]]\n*[[William Edward Phipps]] (speaking voice); [[Mike Douglas]] (singing voice); [[Jeffrey Stone]] (live-action model) as [[Prince Charming]]\n*[[Lucille Bliss]] (voice); Helene Stanley (live-action model) as Anastasia\n*[[Rhoda Williams]] as Drizella\n*[[Jimmy MacDonald (sound effects artist)|Jimmy MacDonald]] as Jaq, Gus and Bruno \n*[[Luis van Rooten]] as The King and the Grand Duke\n*[[June Foray]] as Lucifer\n*[[Betty Lou Gerson]] as the Narrator\n\n== Animators ==\n* [[Marc Davis (animator)|Marc Davis]], [[Eric Larson]], and [[Les Clark]] were the supervising animators of [[Cinderella (Disney character)|Cinderella]].\n* [[Frank Thomas (animator)|Frank Thomas]] was the supervising animator of Lady Tremaine.\n* [[Milt Kahl]] was the supervising animator of Fairy Godmother.\n* [[Ollie Johnston]] was the supervising animator of Drizella Tremaine and Anastasia Tremaine.\n* [[Ward Kimball]], [[Wolfgang Reitherman]], and [[John Lounsbery]] were the supervising animators of Jaq and Gus.\n* Ward Kimball, John Lounsbery, and [[Norm Ferguson (animator)|Norm Ferguson]] were the supervising animators of Bruno and Lucifer.\n* Milt Kahl and Norman Ferguson were the supervising animators of The King.\n* Frank Thomas, Milt Kahl, and Norman Ferguson were the supervising animators of The Grand Duke.\n\n==Production==\n===Story development===\nIn 1922, Walt Disney produced a [[Laugh-O-Gram Studio|Laugh-O-Gram]] cartoon based on \"Cinderella\", and he had been interested in producing a second version in December 1933 as a [[Silly Symphony]] short. [[Burt Gillett]] was attached as the director while [[Frank Churchill]] was assigned as the composer. A story outline included \"white mice and birds\" as Cinderella's playmates. To expand the story, storyboard artists suggested visual gags, some of which ended up in the final film.<ref>{{cite AV media notes|title=The \"Cinderella\" that Never Was|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SCJddWARUs |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211212/3SCJddWARUs| archive-date=2021-12-12 |url-status=live|publisher=Walt Disney Home Entertainment|via=[[YouTube]]|year=2005|type=Documentary film|format=DVD}}{{cbignore}}</ref> However, by early 1938, the story proved to be too complicated to be condensed into a short so it was suggested as a potential animated feature film, starting with a fourteen-page outline written by Al Perkins.{{sfn|Barrier|1999|p=397}}{{sfn|Barrier|2008|pp=208, 361}} Two years later, a second [[Film treatment|treatment]] was written by Dana Cofy and [[Bianca Majolie]], in which Cinderella's stepmother was named Florimel de la Pochel; her stepsisters as Wanda and Javotte; her pet mouse Dusty and pet turtle Clarissa; the stepsisters' cat Bon Bob; the Prince's aide Spink, and the stepsisters' dancing instructor Monsieur Carnewal. This version stuck closely to the original fairy tale until Cinderella arrives home late from the second ball. Her stepfamily then imprisons Cinderella in a dungeon cellar. When Spink and his troops arrive at the la Pochel residence, Dusty takes the slipper and leads them to free Cinderella.{{sfn|Koenig|1997|p=74}}\n\nBy September 1943, Disney had assigned [[Dick Huemer]] and [[Joe Grant]] to begin work on ''Cinderella'' as story supervisors and given a preliminary budget of $1 million.{{sfn|Barrier|1999|pp=397\u2013398}} However, by 1945, their preliminary story work was halted.<ref>{{cite book|first=John|last=Canemaker|title=Two Guys Named Joe: Master Animation Storytellers Joe Grant & Joe Ranft|publisher=Disney Editions|year=2010|isbn=978-1-423-11067-5|pages=165\u2013166}}</ref> During the writing stages of ''[[Song of the South]]'' (1946), Dalton S. Reymond and [[Maurice Rapf]] quarreled, and Rapf was reassigned to work on ''Cinderella''.<ref>{{cite book|last=Beck|first=Jerry|title=The Animated Movie Guide|url=https://www.google.com/books/edition/_/fTI1yeZd-tkC|publisher=Chicago Review Press|page=[https://www.google.com/books/edition/_/fTI1yeZd-tkC?hl=en&gbpv=1&pg=PA260 260]|year=2005|isbn=978-1-556-52683-1|via=Google Books}}</ref> In his version, Cinderella was written to be a less passive character than [[Snow White (Disney character)|Snow White]], and more rebellious against her stepfamily. Rapf explained, \"My thinking was you can't have somebody who comes in and changes everything for you. You can't be delivered on a platter. You've got to earn it. So in my version, the Fairy Godmother said, 'It's okay till midnight but from then on it's up to you.' I made her earn it, and what she had to do to achieve it was to rebel against her stepmother and stepsisters, to stop being a slave in her own home. So I had a scene where they're ordering her around and she throws the stuff back at them. She revolts, so they lock her up in the attic. I don't think anyone took (my idea) very seriously.\"{{sfn|Koenig|1997|p=75}}\n\nIn spring 1946, Disney held three story meetings, and subsequently received treatment from [[Ted Sears]], Homer Brightman, and Harry Reeves dated March 24, 1947. In the treatment, the Prince was introduced earlier in the story reminiscent of ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]'' (1937),{{sfn|Barrier|1999|p=398}} and there was a hint of the cat-and-mouse conflict. By May 1947, the first rough phase of storyboarding was in the process, and an inventory report that same month suggested a different approach with the story \"largely through the animals in the barnyard and their observations of Cinderella's day-to-day activities\".{{sfn|Barrier|1999|p=398}}\n\nFollowing the theatrical release of ''[[Fun and Fancy Free]]'' (1947), Walt Disney Productions' bank debt declined from $4.2 million to $3 million.{{sfn|Barrier|2008|p=205}} Around this time, Disney acknowledged the need for sound economic policies but emphasized to the loaners that slashing production would be suicidal. To restore the studio to full financial health, he expressed his desire to return to producing full-length animated films. By then, three animated projects\u2014''Cinderella'', ''[[Alice in Wonderland (1951 film)|Alice in Wonderland]]'' (1951), and ''[[Peter Pan (1953 film)|Peter Pan]]'' (1953)\u2014were in development. Disney felt the characters in ''Alice in Wonderland'' and ''Peter Pan'' were too cold, while ''Cinderella'' contained elements similar to ''Snow White'', and greenlit the project. Selecting his top-tier animation talent, [[Ben Sharpsteen]] was assigned as supervising producer while [[Hamilton Luske]], [[Wilfred Jackson]], and [[Clyde Geronimi]] became the sequence directors.{{sfn|Thomas|1994|p=209}} Nevertheless, production on ''Alice'' resumed so that both animation crews would effectively compete against each other to see which film would finish first.{{sfn|Gabler|2006|p=459}}\n\nBy early 1948, ''Cinderella'' had progressed further than ''Alice in Wonderland'', and was fast-tracked to become the first full-length animated film since ''Bambi'' (1942).{{sfn|Barrier|1999|p=398}} During a story meeting on January 15, 1948, the cat-and-mouse sequences began to grow into an important element in the film so much that Disney placed veteran story artist [[Bill Peet]] in charge of the cat-and-mouse segments.{{sfn|Barrier|2008|p=219}}\n\nBy the late 1940s, Disney's involvement during production had shrunken noticeably. As he was occupied with trains and the filming of ''[[Treasure Island (1950 film)|Treasure Island]]'' (1950), the directors were left to exercise their own judgment more on details.{{sfn|Barrier|2008|p=220}} Although Disney no longer held daily story meetings, the three directors still communicated with him by mailing him memoranda, scripts, Photostats of storyboards, and acetates of soundtrack recordings while he was in England for two and a half months during the summer of 1949. When Disney did not respond, work resumed and then had to be undone when he did.{{sfn|Barrier|1999|pp=399\u2013400}} In one instance, when Disney returned to the studio on August 29, he reviewed Luske's animation sequences and ordered numerous minor changes, as well as a significant reworking of the film's climax. Production was finished by October 13, 1949.{{sfn|Barrier|2008|p=221}}\n\n===Casting===\nMack David and Jerry Livingston had asked [[Ilene Woods]] to sing on several demo recordings of the songs. They had previously known her from her eponymous radio show, which was broadcast on [[ABC Radio Network|ABC]].

Additionally, the animators were instructed to draw from a certain directorial perspective to avoid difficult shots and angles.{{sfn|Gabler|2006|p=460}} Frank Thomas explained, \"Anytime you'd think of another way of staging the scene, they'd say: 'We can't get the camera up there'!
