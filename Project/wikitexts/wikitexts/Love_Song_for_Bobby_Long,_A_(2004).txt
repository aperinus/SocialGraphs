It stars  [[John Travolta]] as the title character, an aging alcoholic, and [[Scarlett Johansson]] as a headstrong young woman who returns to [[New Orleans]], [[Louisiana]] after her estranged mother's death.\n\nThe film had its world premiere at the [[61st Venice International Film Festival]] on September 2, 2004. It began a [[Limited theatrical release|limited release]] in the United States on December 29, 2004, followed by a [[wide release]] on January 21, 2005, by [[Lionsgate Films|Lions Gate Films]]. Johansson received her third [[Golden Globe Awards|Golden Globe Award]] nomination for her performance.\n\n==Plot==\nAfter her mother Lorraine, a jazz singer whom she felt neglected her for her career, dies from a drug overdose, 18-year-old Purslane \u201cPursy\u201d Hominy Will leaves a [[Florida]] [[trailer park]], where she lives with an abusive boyfriend, to return to her hometown of [[New Orleans]], after having dropped out of high school and left the city.\n\nShe is surprised to find strangers living in her mother's dilapidated home: Bobby Long, a former professor of literature at [[Auburn University]], and his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 and former teaching assistant, Lawson Pines, a struggling writer. Both heavy drinkers and smokers, they pass time quoting poets, playing chess, and spending time with the neighbors; Long also sings country-folk songs. The two convince Pursy that her mother left the house to all three of them. More exactly, the truth is that Pursy is the sole heir, and her mother's will limits how long the other two can stay in the house.\n\nPursy moves in, acting as the most responsible member of the evolving [[dysfunctional family]]. The men's efforts to drive her away decline as they grow more fond of her. Bobby - slovenly and suffering from ailments he prefers to ignore - tries to improve Pursy by introducing her to the novel ''[[The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter]]''; he also encourages her to return to high school and get her degree. Lawson is attracted to her but hesitates to become involved. The three have memories of Lorraine, especially Pursy, who feels that her mother ignored her to pursue her jazz career. When she finds a cache of letters her mother wrote to her but never mailed, Pursy learns more about how Lorraine felt about her, and the identity of her biological father.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[John Travolta]] as Bobby Long \n*[[Scarlett Johansson]] as Purslan \"Pursy\" Hominy Will\n*[[Gabriel Macht]] as Lawson Pines \n*[[Deborah Kara Unger]] as Georgianna \n*[[Clayne Crawford]] as Lee\n*[[Sonny Shroyer]] as Earl\n*[[Carol Sutton (actress)|Carol Sutton]] as Ruthie\n*[[Warren Kole]] as Sean (as Warren Blosjo)\n*[[Nick Loren]] as Merchant\n\n==Production ==\nAccording to the film credits, it was shot on location in New Orleans and [[Gretna, Louisiana]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=A Love Song for Bobby Long |url=https://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/533749/a-love-song-for-bobby-long |access-date=13 September 2021 |website=[[Turner Classic Movies|Turner Classic Movie Database]]}}</ref>\n\n== Soundtrack ==\nThe soundtrack includes \"Someday\" by [[Los Lobos]], \"Bone\" by [[Thalia Zedek]], \"Lonesome Blues\" by [[Lonnie Pitchford]], \"Different Stars\" and \"Lie in the Sound\" by [[Trespassers William]], \"All I Ask is Your Love\" by [[Helen Humes]], \"Rising Son\" by [[Big Bill Morganfield]], \"Praying Ground Blues\" by [[Lightnin' Hopkins]], and \"Blonde on Blonde\" by [[Nada Surf]].

It's unusual to find an American movie that takes its time. It's remarkable to listen to dialogue that assumes the audience is well-read. It is refreshing to hear literate conversation. These are modest pleasures, but real enough.\"<ref>{{cite web |last=Ebert |first=Roger |date=January 27, 2005 |title=More than a drunkard's tale |url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/a-love-song-for-bobby-long-2005 |accessdate=22 September 2017 |website=RogerEbert.com}}</ref>\n\nCarina Chocano of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' wrote that the film \n<blockquote>is, deep-down, a redemptive makeover story drenched in alcohol, [[Southern literature]] and the damp romanticism of the bohemian lush life in New Orleans. A lovely noble rot pervades the film in much the same way that it does the city, a longtime repository of lost-cause romanticism. If there's something a little bit moldy about the setup (drunken literary types, hope on the doorstep, healing from beyond the grave), the movie is no less charming or involving for it, and it's no less pleasant to succumb to its wayward allure and wastrel lyricism. Among other things, the characters . . . really know how to turn a phrase, in itself a pleasure so rare it all but demands any flaws be forgiven.<ref>{{cite web |last=Chocano |first=Carina |date=December 29, 2004 |title=\u2018Love Song\u2019 of books and booze |url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2004-dec-29-et-bobby29-story.html |accessdate=22 September 2017 |website=[[Los Angeles Times]]}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n[[Peter Travers]] of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' rated the film two out of four stars, calling it \"an elegant mess.\" He added \"The actors labor to perform a rescue operation...It's the stunning location photography of camera ace [[Elliot Davis (cinematographer)|Elliot Davis]] that provides what the movie itself lacks: authenticity.\"<ref name=\"rollingstone\">{{cite web |last=Travers |first=Peter |date=January 6, 2005 |title=A Love Song for Bobby Long |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/tv-movies/tv-movie-reviews/a-love-song-for-bobby-long-118823/ |url-access=subscription |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220913194411/https://www.rollingstone.com/tv-movies/tv-movie-reviews/a-love-song-for-bobby-long-118823/ |archive-date=13 September 2022 |accessdate=22 September 2017 |website=[[Rolling Stone]]}}</ref>\n\n==Awards and nominations==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!
