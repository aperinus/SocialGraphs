It is a sequel to Wang's 1971 film ''[[One-Armed Boxer]]'', and thus the film is also known as '''''One-Armed Boxer 2''''' and '''''The One-Armed Boxer vs. the Flying Guillotine'''''.<ref name=\"thomas2002\">{{cite news|title= A 'Master' of Style in Martial Arts|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=2002-05-24|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2002/may/24/entertainment/et-master24|access-date=2010-12-23|first=Kevin|last=Thomas}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nThe film concerns Wang's one-armed martial arts master being stalked by an imperial assassin, the master of two fighters (the Tibetan lamas) who were killed in the previous film. The title refers to the assassin's weapon, the \"[[Flying guillotine (weapon)|flying guillotine]]\", which resembles a hat with a bladed rim attached to a long chain. Upon enveloping one's head, the blades cleanly decapitate the victim with a quick pull of the chain. The Boxer's adversary is the assassin Fung Sheng Wu Chi, who is blind, is an expert user of the Flying Guillotine, and relies on others to identify one-armed men, whom he then kills. When the One-Armed Boxer is invited to attend a martial arts tournament, his efforts to lie low are unsuccessful, and the assassin soon tracks him down with the help of his three subordinates competing in the tournament: a [[Muay Thai|Thai boxer]], a [[yoga]] master, and a [[Okinawan kobud\u014d|kobojutsu]] user.\n\nThe One-Armed Boxer leaves the tournament and, using a series of traps, defeats the assassin's subordinates. Unable to directly confront the deadly assassin himself, the One-Armed Boxer devises a plan that uses misdirection. Taking advantage of the assassin's blindness by using bamboo poles as a lure, each time the blind assassin throws his weapon, it becomes snagged on one of the bamboo poles effectively removing the inner blades of the assassin's deadly weapon; however, as it still contains a jagged outer edge it is still a formidable weapon. The One-Armed Boxer then proceeds to convert a coffin-maker's shop into an elaborate trap. Once the weapon is finally destroyed, the One-Armed Boxer engages the assassin in a duel and defeats him.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n*[[Jimmy Wang Yu (actor)|Jimmy Wang Yu]] as Yu Tien Lung, known as the One-Armed Boxer\n*Kam Kong as Fung Sheng Wu Chi\n*Doris Lung as Wu Shao Tieh, a daughter of Wu Chang Sang\n*Sham Chin-bo as Nai Men, the [[Muay Thai|Thai boxer]]\n*Lung Fei as Yakuma\n*Wong Wing-sang as Yogi Tro Le Soung, known as [[Indian martial arts|Indian Fighter]] (The film gives him the name Yogi Tro Le Soung)\n*Sit Hon as Tournament Referee\n*[[Lau Kar-wing]] as Chang Chia Yu, known as fighter with a three-section staff\n*Wong Fei-lung as One-armed boxer's student\n*Yu Chung-chiu as Wu Chang Sang\n*Shan Mao as bamboo cutter\n*Wang Tai-lang as Ma Wu Kung, Monkey stylist\n*Shih Ting-ken as One-armed boxer's student\n*Lung Sai-ga as Wang Jiang\n*[[Philip Kwok]] as Ho Po Wei\n*Lung Fong as Lee Kun Man, known as Tiger Fists / Nose-Picking fight\n*Sun Jung-chi as Daredevil Lee San\n*Wong Lik as Tornado Knives Lei Kung\n*Hau Pak-wai as Cheung Shung, known as fighter with a long braid\n*Ho Wai-hung as Tieh Cheng\n*Chi Fu-Chiang as Iron Skin Niu Sze\n*Ma Chin-Ku as So Leong\n*Chin Lung as Flying Rope Chao Wu\n*Tang Tak-Cheung as Tung Erh, known as Praying Mantis\n*Hsieh Hsing as One Armed Snake Fist Hsieh Hsing\n}}\n\n==Reception==\n[[Rotten Tomatoes]], a [[review aggregator]], reports that 90% of 20 surveyed critics gave the film a positive review; the average rating was 6.9/10.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/master_of_the_flying_guillotine/ |title=Master of the Flying Guillotine |publisher=Rotten Tomatoes |access-date=2012-03-25}}</ref>  [[Metacritic]] rated the film 57/100 based on eleven reviews.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/master-of-the-flying-guillotine-re-release|title=Master of the Flying Guillotine (re-release)|work=[[Metacritic]]|access-date=2014-07-14}}</ref>  Elvis Mitchell of ''[[The New York Times]]'' called it \"near-great\" and \"a venerable example of the kung fu genre\".<ref name=nytimes>{{cite news|title=FILM REVIEW; An Avenger Rampages, and Chop!
