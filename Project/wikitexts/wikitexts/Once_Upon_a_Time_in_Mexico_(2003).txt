It is the final film in Rodriguez's ''[[Mexico Trilogy]]'', and it is a sequel to 1992's ''[[El Mariachi]]'' and 1995's ''[[Desperado (film)|Desperado]]''. The film features [[Antonio Banderas]] in his second and final performance as El Mariachi. In the film, El Mariachi is recruited by [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] agent Sheldon Sands ([[Johnny Depp]]) to kill a corrupt general responsible for the death of his wife, Carolina ([[Salma Hayek]]).\n\nIt was the first 'big budget' film to be shot in digital [[High-Definition Video|HD]]{{Citation needed|date=October 2021}}.  ''Once Upon a Time in Mexico'' received mixed reviews from critics, with praise for Depp's performance, but criticism for reducing its protagonist to an almost secondary character in his own trilogy and a convoluted plot. In the special features of the film's DVD, Rodriguez explained this was intentional, as he wanted this to be his ''[[The Good, the Bad and the Ugly]]'' of the trilogy. ''Once Upon a Time in Mexico'' grossed $98 million.\n\n==Plot==\nEl Mariachi is recruited by [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] officer Sheldon Jeffrey Sands to kill General Emiliano Marquez, a corrupt [[Mexican Army]] officer who has been hired by Mexican drug lord Armando Barillo to assassinate the [[President of Mexico]] and overthrow the government during a period of unrest in [[Culiac\u00e1n]] (the capital of [[Sinaloa]]) which is testing the presidency. Many years before, El Mariachi and his wife Carolina confronted Marquez in a shootout and wounded the general; in retaliation, Marquez took the lives of Carolina and their daughter in an ambush. In addition to El Mariachi, Sands persuades former [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] agent Jorge Ram\u00edrez to come out of retirement and kill Barillo, who had murdered his partner Archuleta in the past. Furthermore, AFN operative Ajedrez is assigned by Sands to tail Barillo.\n\nWhile monitoring Barillo's activities, Ram\u00edrez meets Billy Chambers, an American fugitive who has been living under the protection of Barillo, but can no longer stomach the horrible tasks he's been forced to carry out for him. Ram\u00edrez convinces Chambers he will provide him protection in exchange for getting closer to Barillo by tagging Chambers' pet chihuahua with a hidden microphone, and Chambers agrees to complete the deal by surrendering to U.S. authorities once Barillo has been taken down. Sands' agent, Cucuy, originally hired to keep an eye on El Mariachi, instead turns and tranquilizes El Mariachi and turns him over to Barillo, also offering to reveal the details of Sands's plan. Cucuy, however, is promptly killed by Chambers while El Mariachi escapes from captivity and calls his friends Lorenzo and Fideo to assist him in his mission.\n\nWhile monitoring Barillo's activity outside a hospital, Ram\u00edrez notices armed men storming the building and follows suit. He discovers that a group of doctors have been gunned down and Barillo has bled to death as a result of a botched [[plastic surgery|facial reconstruction]], but realizes that the corpse on the operating table is a [[body double]] before he is knocked out and kidnapped by the real Barillo and Ajedrez, who reveals herself to be Barillo's daughter. Sands realizes that his mission has been compromised, but is too late, as he is captured by Barillo and Ajedrez \u2014 who drill out his eyes before sending him out. Despite his blindness, he manages to gun down a hitman tailing him with the aid of a ''[[chicle]]'' boy.\n\nAs [[Culiac\u00e1n]] celebrates the [[Day of the Dead]] during the President's visit, Marquez and his army storm in and attack the presidential palace. Marquez's troops, however, are met with resistance from not only the President's bodyguards, but also the citizens of Culiac\u00e1n and the Mariachis. Sands had instructed El Mariachi to allow the President to be killed before attacking Marquez, but the Mariachis, concluding that the President is a good man, intervene early and protect him.  Marquez enters the presidential palace, only to once again confront El Mariachi, who shoots out his kneecaps before killing him with a headshot. Ram\u00edrez, who was released from captivity by Chambers, faces Barillo. After Barillo guns down Chambers, Ram\u00edrez and El Mariachi kill the drug lord. Sands manages to shoot the sadistic Ajedrez dead outside the presidential palace. Ultimately, Lorenzo and Fideo walk away with the cash that Barillo was using to pay Marquez, and help the president safely escape the attempted [[coup]]. Ram\u00edrez says goodbye to Sands and walks away, having avenged his partner's death. El Mariachi then gives his share of the cash to his home village before walking into the sunset.\n\n==Cast==\n<!--Johnny Depp did not receive top billing in the film or on its promotional materials and shouldn't here, either--->\n{{Cast listing|\n<!-- opening title cards -->\n* [[Antonio Banderas]] as \"El Mariachi\"\n* [[Salma Hayek]] as Carolina \n* [[Johnny Depp]] as CIA Agent Sands \n* [[Mickey Rourke]] as Billy Chambers\n* [[Eva Mendes]] as Ajedrez \n* [[Danny Trejo]] as \"Cucuy\"\n* [[Enrique Iglesias]] as Lorenzo\n* [[Marco Leonardi]] as Fideo\n* [[Cheech Marin]] as Belini\n* [[Julio Oscar Mechoso]] as Nicholas, Presidential Advisor <!-- Jorge Ramirez? -->\n<!-- with -->\n* [[Rub\u00e9n Blades]] as Jorge Ramirez \n<!-- and -->\n* [[Willem Dafoe]] as Armando Barillo\n<!-- end title cards -->\n}}\n<!-- supporting roles\n* [[Pedro Armend\u00e1riz, Jr.]] as President\n* Tony Valdes as Chicle Boy\n* Gerardo Vigil as General Marquez\n* Miguel Couturier as Dr. Guevera\n-->\nIn a 2003 issue of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', Depp was named as one of its \"People of the Year\", and gave an interview in which he briefly discussed his role as Sands:\n\n<blockquote>The idea behind him is there was this guy I used to know in [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]], in the business, who on the outside was very charming &ndash; soft-spoken and almost hypnotic in the rhythm he used to speak.

Impressed, Rodriguez chose to shoot digitally, but he knew he did not have enough time to shoot ''Spy Kids 2''. Instead, he pitched a sequel to ''Desperado'' to [[Miramax]] and wrote a script in six days. The initial draft was 65 pages long, which he padded with a subplot borrowed from an unproduced short film. When Miramax expressed hesitation over the added subplot, he readily removed it. His primary influence was [[Sergio Leone]]'s ''[[Dollars Trilogy]]'', specifically ''[[The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly]]''. Rodriguez said shooting digitally saved time and money, simplified the filming process, and rendered [[35 mm movie film|35&nbsp;mm film]] obsolete for him.<ref>{{cite book|title=Robert Rodriguez: Interviews|last1=McKernan|first1=Brian|last2=Zahn|first2=Bob|editor-last=Ingle|editor-first=Zachary|publisher=[[University Press of Mississippi]]|year=2012|isbn=9781617032721|pages=75\u201382}}</ref>\n\n==Soundtrack==\n{{Infobox album\n| name       = Original Motion Picture Soundtrack: Once Upon a Time in Mexico\n| type       = soundtrack\n| artist     = various artists\n| released   = September 2003\n| genre      = [[Soundtrack]]<br>[[Rock music|Rock]]<br>[[Chicano rock|Latin rock]]\n| length     = 51:44\n| label      = [[Milan Records]]\n| chronology = [[Robert Rodriguez]] film soundtrack\n| prev_title = [[Spy Kids 3-D: Game Over#Soundtrack|Spy Kids 3-D: Game Over]]\n| prev_year  = 2003\n| next_title = [[Sin City (soundtrack)|Sin City]]\n| next_year  = 2005\n}}\n{{Album ratings\n| rev1       = [[AllMusic]]\n| rev1Score  = {{Rating|4.5|5}} [{{AllMusic|class=album|id=r655546|pure_url=yes}} link]\n| noprose    = yes\n}}\nThe film's score includes songs composed by director [[Robert Rodriguez]] and performed by a group of musicians gathered specifically for the soundtrack recording.
