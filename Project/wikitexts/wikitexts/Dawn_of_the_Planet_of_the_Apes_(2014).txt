It is the sequel to ''[[Rise of the Planet of the Apes]]'' (2011), and the second installment in the [[Planet of the Apes#Reboot film series|''Planet of the Apes'' reboot franchise]]. It stars [[Andy Serkis]] as [[Caesar (Planet of the Apes)|Caesar]], alongside [[Jason Clarke]], [[Gary Oldman]], [[Keri Russell]], [[Toby Kebbell]], and [[Kodi Smit-McPhee]]. In ''Dawn of the Planet of the Apes'', human survivors are battling to stay alive in the wake of a deadly [[pandemic]] which has lasted for a decade, while Caesar tries to maintain control over his expanding ape community. But when both species cross into each other, they try and make a truce to maintain peace with one another and hope to prevent a war between apes and humans.\n\nA sequel to ''Rise of the Planet of the Apes'' was announced in 2011, with the returns of both Serkis and [[Rupert Wyatt]] confirmed that November. Wyatt departed the film in September 2012, and Reeves was hired that October. Casting took place between February and March 2013, with no additional original main cast members returning. [[Principal photography]] commenced that April and lasted until that July, with filming locations including [[Campbell River, British Columbia|Campbell River]], [[Vancouver Island]], and [[New Orleans]]. The apes were created using visual effects and [[motion capture|performance capture]] as commissioned by [[Weta Digital]], with the film featuring greater use of these components during action sequences and to create other animals.\n\n''Dawn of the Planet of the Apes'' premiered on June 26, 2014 at the [[Palace of Fine Arts]] in [[San Francisco]] and was theatrically released worldwide by [[20th Century Fox]] on July 11. The film received highly positive reviews, with praise for Reeves' direction, visual effects, the performances of the cast, [[Michael Giacchino]]'s score, action sequences, and emotional depth. ''Dawn of the Planet of the Apes'' was a commercial success, grossing over $710 million, making it the [[2014 in film#Highest-grossing films|eighth-highest grossing film of 2014]] and the highest-grossing film in the franchise. It also received [[List of accolades received by Dawn of the Planet of the Apes|numerous awards and nominations]], including an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Visual Effects|Best Visual Effects]]. The sequel, ''[[War for the Planet of the Apes]]'', was released in 2017.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films are to be between 400 to 700 words! -->\nYears<!-- No calendar year, like 2021 or 2026, is given in the film. --> after the global pandemic of a deadly Simian Flu,{{efn|As depicted in ''[[Rise of the Planet of the Apes]]'' (2011)<ref>{{cite web|url=https://heavy.com/movies/2017/07/war-for-the-planet-of-apes-how-many-years-before-original-timeline-is-set-year/|title='War for the Planet of the Apes': What Year Does the Original Take Place?|last=Morrow|first=Brendan|work=[[Heavy.com|Heavy]]|date=July 13, 2017|access-date=June 24, 2018}}</ref>|name=|group=}} the worldwide human population is drastically reduced, with only about one in 500 genetically immune. This causes [[societal collapse]] among humans. The apes, all bestowed with genetically enhanced intelligence by the virus, establish a colony in the [[Muir Woods National Monument|Muir Woods]] near [[San Francisco]].\n\nA group of humans, led by a man named Malcolm, trespass the apes' territory, in search of a [[hydroelectric]] [[dam]] that would restore power to San Francisco. An encounter with the apes, ends with a man named Carver badly hurting the chimpanzee Ash. Malcolm manages to prevent further escalation, and [[Caesar (Planet of the Apes)|Caesar]], the apes' leader, orders the humans to leave. Prompted by [[Koba (Planet of the Apes)|Koba]], a scarred bonobo, Caesar brings his army to the humans' community as a display of strength. Caesar announces to the community that, despite the apes not wanting war, he will fight the humans if he is forced to. He demands the humans to stay in their territory. Malcolm convinces his fellow leader Dreyfus to give him time to take a small team to the forest, reconcile with the apes and access the dam. Eventually, Caesar allows them to work on the generator on the condition that they surrender their guns. While working together, Malcolm, his wife Ellie, and his son Alexander bond with the apes. The fragile relationship briefly falls apart when Carver is discovered to have kept a hidden gun and is thus forcibly sent away, but it is greatly restored when Ellie, a [[nurse]], effectively treats Caesar's wife Cornelia's illness.\n\nDreyfus arms his community with the [[Fort Point, San Francisco|Fort Point]] armory. Koba, who has a [[Feud|vendetta]] against humans for his mistreatment as a [[laboratory]] test subject, discovers the armory and confronts Caesar, accusing him of loving humans more than apes. Caesar beats Koba in response but refrains from killing him. Koba later returns to the armory, kills two guards, and secretly kills Carver after the humans succeed in repairing the generator. Koba takes advantage of their celebration to covertly set fire to the apes' home. He then shoots Caesar, who falls into an underbrush. Koba frames the humans for Caesar's apparent death and the fire to justify war. Taking command, he leads the ape army to San Francisco, where they plunder the armory and mount a full-scale assault on the humans. Despite taking heavy casualties, the apes breach the building and imprison the humans as Dreyfus flees underground. While refusing orders to kill unarmed humans, Ash cites Caesar's teachings, and Koba throws him to his death. He also has any other ape who is loyal to Caesar imprisoned, including Maurice, Luca, and Rocket.\n\nMalcolm's family finds a severely wounded Caesar and transports him to his former house in San Francisco. After sneaking back into the settlement to find medical supplies, Malcolm encounters Blue Eyes, Caesar's son. Blue Eyes spares him before learning that his father is still alive and accompanies Malcolm to Caesar's place. After learning that it was Koba who shot Caesar, Blue Eyes reconciles with his father, returns to the tower and frees every human and ape imprisoned there. After escorting the apes into the tower, Malcolm finds Dreyfus. Apparently, the return of electricity allowed Dreyfus' men to make radio contact with survivors from a military base, who are now coming to fight the apes. Caesar confronts Koba at the top of the tower; as they fight, Dreyfus, in a suicide mission, detonates bombs that destabilize the building in a failed attempt to kill the apes. Willing to shoot at the apes that want to help Caesar, Koba eventually looses. While clinging on a metal girder, he is disowned as an ape by Caesar and dropped to his death.\n\nMalcolm warns Caesar of the approaching human military. Caesar responds \"War has already begun\" because of Koba's violent reign. Believing that the humans will never forgive the apes for their attack, Caesar convinces Malcolm to leave with his family before the fighting begins. He then adresses the apes, preparing for the upcoming war.<!--Do NOT include info on the post-credits sounds of an ape moving through the rubble, as they add nothing to the plot.-->\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:SDCC13 - Dawn of the Planet of the Apes (9348023398).jpg|thumb|right|200px|Cast and crew of ''Dawn of the Planet of the Apes'' (from left): director [[Matt Reeves]] and stars [[Jason Clarke]], [[Keri Russell]] and [[Andy Serkis]]]]\n\n===[[Ape]]s===\n* [[Andy Serkis]] as [[Caesar (Planet of the Apes)|Caesar]], a [[chimpanzee]] who is leader to a tribe of enhanced apes.\n* [[Toby Kebbell]] as [[Koba (Planet of the Apes)|Koba]], a treacherous [[bonobo]].\n* [[Judy Greer]] as Cornelia, Caesar's chimpanzee wife.\n* [[Nick Thurston]] as Blue Eyes, Caesar's eldest chimpanzee son.\n* [[Terry Notary]] as Rocket, a chimpanzee and Caesar's loyal lieutenant.\n* [[Karin Konoval]] as Maurice, a [[Bornean orangutan]] and Caesar's loyal friend and adviser.\n* [[Doc Shaw]] as Ash, Rocket's chimpanzee son.\n* [[Lee Ross (actor)|Lee Ross]] as Grey, a chimpanzee and Koba's henchman.\nScott Lang appears as Luca, a [[western lowland gorilla]] in Caesar's tribe.\n\n===[[Human]]s===\n* [[Jason Clarke]] as Malcolm, the leader of the small group that forms a strong bond with Caesar and the other apes, Alexander's father, and Ellie's husband.\n* [[Gary Oldman]] as Dreyfus, an ex-police officer and the leader of the remaining human survivors.\n* [[Keri Russell]] as Ellie, a former nurse at the Centers for Disease Control, Malcolm's wife, and Alexander's stepmother.\n* [[Kodi Smit-McPhee]] as Alexander, Malcolm's son from a previous marriage and Ellie's stepson.\n* [[Kirk Acevedo]] as Carver, a former San Francisco water worker and a member of Malcolm's group.\n* Jon Eyez as Foster, a member of Malcolm's group.\n* [[Enrique Murciano]] as Kemp, a member of Malcolm's group.\n* [[Keir O'Donnell]] as Finney, an ally of Dreyfus.\n* [[Kevin Rankin (actor)|Kevin Rankin]] as McVeigh, a guard at the colony's armory.\n* [[Jocko Sims]] as Werner, the colony's radio operator.\n\nAdditionally, [[James Franco]] makes an uncredited appearance as Will Rodman, Caesar's owner, utilizing a combination of new and unused footage from ''Rise of the Planet of the Apes''.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.cinemablend.com/new/James-Franco-Dawn-Planet-Apes-Here-How-43833.html | title=James Franco is in Dawn of the Planet of the Apes -- Here's How | date=July 10, 2014 }}</ref>\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Rampart St Planet of the Apes May 2013 3.JPG|right|thumb|Film set on Rampart Street, New Orleans, May 2013]]\n\n===Development===\nAfter the release of ''[[Rise of the Planet of the Apes]]'', director [[Rupert Wyatt]] commented on possible [[sequel]]s: \"I think we're ending with certain questions, which is quite exciting.
