Alex, a strait-laced [[White Anglo-Saxon Protestant|WASP-ish]] type, meets Isabel Fuentes, a free-spirited Mexican-American photographer. Alex and Isabel are overtaken by lust at first sight and spend the night together; however, their immediate attraction does not last, and in the cold morning light, Isabel quietly slips away while Alex is still asleep.\n\nThree months later, they meet again when Isabel has some interesting news for Alex: she is pregnant with his child. Isabel is keeping and raising the child alone, knowing it will disappoint her family. She invites Alex to a family dinner so they can meet her baby's father at least once. Alex agrees, and despite some cultural differences, finds himself more attracted to Isabel. Though Isabel is prepared to say goodbye, Alex suggests they pursue a relationship. He proposes and they quickly marry at a Las Vegas wedding chapel (with an Elvis impersonator serving as a witness), but gradually, both wonder if they belong together, especially as Alex struggles to balance his New York career with Isabel's desire to stay in Nevada.\n\nIsabel suffers from a medical complication. While in the hospital, she tells Alex she lost the baby and says they're not meant to be together. Disappointed, Alex returns to New York while Isabel, who is still pregnant, goes to Mexico to stay with her great-grandmother. After being served with divorce papers, Alex realizes he loves Isabel and wants her more than his career. He travels to rural Mexico to find Isabel, unaware she is still pregnant. Her great-grandmother, who only speaks Spanish, reveals that Isabel loves Alex and is driving back to Las Vegas to have her baby (which he only understands as she has returned to Las Vegas). He intercepts her at the [[Hoover Dam]] and says he loves her, then realizes she is still pregnant. She suddenly goes into labor and gives birth to a daughter which coincides with their divorce becoming finalized. Soon after they remarry with both families present, atop a cliff overlooking the [[Grand Canyon]].\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Matthew Perry]] as Alex Whitman\n* [[Salma Hayek]] as Isabel Fuentes-Whitman\n* [[Jon Tenney]] as Jeff\n* [[Carlos G\u00f3mez (actor)|Carlos G\u00f3mez]] as Chuy\n* [[Tomas Milian]] as Tomas Fuentes\n* [[Siobhan Fallon Hogan|Siobhan Fallon]] as Lainie\n* [[John Bennett Perry]] as Richard Whitman\n* [[Stanley DeSantis]] as Judd Marshall\n* [[Suzanne Snyder]] as Cathy Stewart\n* [[Anne Betancourt]] as Amalia Fuentes\n* [[Jill Clayburgh]] as Nan Whitman\n* [[Garret Davis]] as Stan\n* [[Annie Combs]] as Dr. Lisa Barnes, Ob-Gyn\n* [[Annetta Ray]] as minister performing marriage\n* [[Debby Shively]]  as Donna, construction manager\n* [[Robert Arevalo]] as Miguel Fuentes\n\n==Soundtrack==\nThe following list of titles represents the music used in sequence with the movie.\n\n# Santa Claus is Comin' to Town \u2013 [[Burl Ives]] (office Christmas party scene)\n# [[Jailhouse Rock (song)|Jailhouse Rock]] \u2013 [[Elvis Presley]] (Alex gets excited about Las Vegas)\n# Las Abaje\u00f1as \u2013 Mariachi Reyes de Aserradero\n# Two to Tango \u2013 [[Vanessa Daou]] (one-night stand/morning after)\n# Para Donde Vas \u2013 [[The Iguanas (Louisiana band)|The Iguanas]] (playing while Alex follows Isabel in his car, just after she announces she's pregnant)\n# El Pichon\n# La Martiniana\n# Ain't That a Kick in the Head \u2013 [[Dean Martin]] (Elvis impersonator wedding/honeymoon scene)\n# Linda Guerita \u2013 [[Brave Combo]]\n# Si Tu Te Vas \u2013 [[Enrique Iglesias]]\n# Mi Tierra \u2013 [[Gloria Estefan]]\n# La Virgen de la Macarena \u2013 [[P\u00e9rez Prado]]\n# Nothing is Permanent \u2013 [[Brave Combo]]\n# [[La Bamba (song)|La Bamba]] \u2013 Mariachi Vargas de Tecalitl\u00e1n\n# Los Machetes \u2013 Mariachi Vargas de Tecalitl\u00e1n\n# [[Fever (1956 song)|Fever]] \u2013 [[Peggy Lee]] (Alex's parents leaving Las Vegas scene)\n# Talk to Me \u2013 [[Wild Orchid (band)|Wild Orchid]] (\"Boulevard Club\" opening night scene)\n# Naked Eye \u2013 [[Luscious Jackson]] (\"Boulevard Club\" opening night scene/Isabel walks out)\n# I Wonder \u2013 [[Chris Isaak]] (Isabel on her way to her grandmother's house)\n# [[Danke Schoen]] \u2013 [[Wayne Newton]] (Alex's \"epiphany\"/leaving New York)\n# [[It's Now or Never (song)|It's Now or Never]] \u2013 [[Elvis Presley]] (Alex on the trail to find Isabel)\n# [[Can't Help Falling in Love]] \u2013 [[Elvis Presley]] (The \"real wedding\"/closing credits)\n\n==Reception==\n''Fools Rush In'' received mixed reviews from critics.
