His mother died when he was a child and his father Neil was physically and psychologically abusive. During his adolescence, Stephen has lived most of his life behaving very destructively and abusing drugs (of which [[Adderall]] is an example) and committing petty vandalism.\n\nNow in his 30s, Stephen accepts a deal to write his next book about Hans Reiser, a software guru who developed the [[ReiserFS|Reiser filesystem]]. Hans had a volatile marriage and his wife has recently gone missing. Despite Hans' claims that his wife has simply gone into hiding to hurt him, the police arrested him on suspicion of murder, where he awaits trial. In attendance to the trial is Stephen who is hoping to make Hans' memoir a best seller.\n\nStephen's previous book is an autobiography about his childhood that is about to get released. At a press release, Stephen reads a part from the book talking about how his estranged father hurt and abused him only for Neil to stand out and brand him a liar. This causes Stephen to question his childhood memories. In despair, Stephen hooks up on recreational drugs, goes to a club, and sleeps with a random person. The next morning, a hungover Stephen checks his voicemails, which include his publisher dropping him for missing an important meeting, and Lana Edmond, a woman he was starting a relationship with, dumping him. To make matters worse, Stephen realizes that he also slept through the jury announcing their verdict on Hans, finding him guilty of murder.\n\nStephen reconnects with Neil where he finds out about his cancer diagnosis. While talking, Stephen figures out that while Neil made some parenting mistakes, Stephen is falsely remembering his father being downright abusive. A recurring memory of Neil handcuffing him until he bled was because Stephen was trying to commit suicide and Neil was desperately trying to restrain him.\n\nIn the end, Stephen writes over the course of two days about making amends with his father. Stephen's agent approves of the newly written manuscript and agrees to have it published. Meanwhile, it is revealed in the news that Hans has finally admitted to killing his wife because she was going to leave him and take his children. He has shown the cops where her body is buried in exchange for a lesser sentence.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Castlist|\n* [[James Franco]] as [[Stephen Elliott (author)|Stephen Elliott]]\n** [[Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet]] as young Stephen Elliott\n* [[Ed Harris]] as Neil Elliott\n* [[Amber Heard]] as Lana Edmond\n* [[Jim Parrack]] as Roger\n** [[Daniel Flaherty]] as young Roger\n* [[Christian Slater]] as [[Hans Reiser]]\n* [[Cynthia Nixon]] as Jen Davis\n* [[Adam LeFevre]] as Bill DuBois\n* [[Michael Cristofer]] as Paul Hora\n* [[Wilmer Valderrama]] as Josh\n}}\n\n==Production==\n\n===Development===\nDirector [[Pamela Romanowsky]] met [[James Franco]] at [[New York University]] while attending the MFA Film Program.
