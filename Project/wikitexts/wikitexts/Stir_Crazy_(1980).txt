While in prison they befriend other prison inmates. The film reunited Wilder and Pryor, who had appeared previously in the 1976 comedy thriller film ''[[Silver Streak (film)|Silver Streak]]''. The film was released in the United States on December 12, 1980 to mixed critical reviews, but was a major financial success.\n\n== Plot ==\nAspiring [[actor]] Harry Monroe (Pryor) is working as a waiter in a rich woman's penthouse, but is fired when the cooks accidentally use his stash of [[marijuana]] as [[oregano]] at a dinner party. His friend, [[playwright]] Skip Donahue (Wilder), is working as a shop detective when he thinks he sees a well-known actress shoplifting, and his accusation gets him fired. Skip, the optimist of the two, spins their shared unemployment positively and convinces Harry that they should travel to California. They leave [[New York City]] in a battered Dodge camper-van, taking odd jobs along the way.\n\nIn [[Arizona]], Skip and Harry perform a song and dance routine dressed as woodpeckers as part of a promotion for a bank. While the duo are on a break, two men steal the costumes and rob the bank. However, Harry and Skip are arrested and convicted of the crime, and given 125-year jail sentences. Their court-appointed lawyer, Len Garber, advises them to wait until he can appeal their case.\n\nThe two are transferred to a maximum-security prison. After a failed attempt at faking [[insanity]], they make friends with Jesus Ramirez, a bank robber, and Rory Schultebrand, an overtly [[gay]] man who killed his stepfather. After three months, Skip and Harry visit Warden Walter Beatty and Deputy Warden Ward Wilson, the head guard, to perform a \"test\" on a [[mechanical bull]]. To everyone's surprise, Skip is able to ride the bull at full power, so Beatty selects him to compete in the prison's annual rodeo competition.\n\nJesus and Rory inform Harry and Skip that the rodeo is a crooked operation run by Beatty and Warden Henry Sampson, who heads the neighboring prison. The money from the rodeo, which is supposed to go to the prisoners, ends up in the wardens' pockets. Realizing Skip will be selected as the prison's new champion, Jesus and Rory hatch a plan for escape involving Skip refusing to participate until the warden provides concessions. They warn Skip that he will be tortured by the warden first. Skip, however, has a blas\u00e9 attitude towards everything the guards throw at him, including a week in the \"hot box\" and forcing him and Harry to share a cell with hulking, seemingly-mute serial killer Grossberger.\n\nHarry and Skip are visited by Garber, who introduces them to his law partner, his cousin Meredith, to whom Skip is immediately attracted. Later, Skip meets with Beatty to make a deal: In exchange for his participation in the rodeo, Skip requests his own crew (Harry, Jesus, Rory and Grossberger), along with a shared cell for the five of them. Beatty agrees, later ordering Wilson to have a guard watch them at all times. Wilson reveals to his esteemed colleague, former rodeo champion Jack Graham, that Skip will not leave the rodeo alive.\n\nWhile practicing for the rodeo, Skip, Harry, Jesus, Rory, and Grossberger acquire tools they need for their escape, while Meredith gets a job as a waitress in a country western [[strip club]] searching for possible suspects and encounters the real bank robbers. At the stadium where the rodeo is being held, each member of Skip's team but Grossberger escape through a secret path, taking them through air vents to be met by either Jesus' wife or brother. Once through, they put on their disguises and re-enter the grounds as audience members.\n\nSkip competes against rival champion Caesar Geronimo to swipe the prize: a bag of money from the horns of a large, [[Brahman (cattle)|Brahman]] bull. Skip suggests that they give the money to the prisoners, and offers to help Caesar win if he agrees to do so. Caesar wins, and throws the bag to the inmates, while Skip escapes and joins his friends.\n\nAt a secret meeting spot, Jesus and Rory bid Harry and Skip farewell as they leave for [[Mexico]]. Harry and Skip get in their car, but are intercepted by Garber and Meredith. She tells Harry and Skip that the police have collared the real crooks, and Harry and Skip intend to resume their original idea of going to Hollywood. Skip asks Meredith to go with him, and she agrees to it.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Gene Wilder]] as Skip Donahue\n* [[Richard Pryor]] as Harry Monroe\n* [[Georg Stanford Brown]] as Rory Schultebrand\n* [[JoBeth Williams]] as Meredith\n* [[Miguel \u00c1ngel Su\u00e1rez]] as Jesus Ramirez\n* [[Craig T.
