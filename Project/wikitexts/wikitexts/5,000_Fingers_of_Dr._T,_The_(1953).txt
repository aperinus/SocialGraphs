It was the only [[feature film]] written by Theodor Seuss Geisel ([[Dr. Seuss]]), who wrote the story, [[screenplay]], and [[lyrics]]. It was directed by [[Roy Rowland (film director)|Roy Rowland]], with many uncredited takes directed by producer [[Stanley Kramer]]. The film stars [[Peter Lind Hayes]], [[Mary Healy (entertainer)|Mary Healy]], [[Hans Conried]], and [[Tommy Rettig]].\n\n==Plot==\nYoung Bart Collins ([[Tommy Rettig]]) lives with his widowed mother Heloise ([[Mary Healy (entertainer)|Mary Healy]]). The bane of Bart's existence is the hated piano lessons he endures under the tutelage of the [[autocratic]] Dr. Terwilliker ([[Hans Conried]]). Bart feels that his mother has fallen under Terwilliker's influence, and gripes to their [[plumber]], August Zabladowski ([[Peter Lind Hayes]]), without result. While hammering at his lessons, Bart dozes off and enters a musical dream.\n\nIn the dream, Bart is trapped at the surreal Terwilliker Institute, where the piano teacher is a madman dictator who has imprisoned non-piano-playing musicians. He built a piano so large that it requires Bart and 499 other boys (hence, 5,000 fingers) to play it. Bart's mother has become Terwilliker's hypnotized assistant and bride-to-be, and Bart must dodge the Institute's guards as he scrambles to save his mother and himself. He tries to recruit Mr. Zabladowski, who was hired to install the Institute's lavatories ahead of a vital inspection, but only after skepticism and foot-dragging is Zabladowski convinced to help. The two construct a noise-sucking contraption which ruins the mega-piano's opening concert. The enslaved boys run riot, and the \"atomic\" noise-sucker explodes in spectacular fashion, bringing Bart out from his dream.\n\nThe movie ends on a hopeful note for Bart, when Mr. Zabladowski notices Heloise and offers to drive her to town in his jeep. Bart escapes from the piano and runs down the street to play, with his dog Sport joyfully capering at his heels.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Peter Lind Hayes]] as August Zabladowski\n* [[Mary Healy (entertainer)|Mary Healy]] as Heloise Collins\n* [[Hans Conried]] as Dr. Terwilliker\n* [[Tommy Rettig]] as Bart Collins\n* John Heasley as Uncle Whitney\n* Robert Heasley as Uncle Judson\n* Noel Cravat as Sgt.

In 2001, [[Glenn Erickson]] wrote that the film was \"another flop that has since gained the reputation of an artsy classic - a real cult film.

In 2002, [[Peter Bradshaw]] said the film \"has charm, a riotous imagination, and some very weird dream-like sets by production designer [[Rudolph Sternad]] and art director [[Cary Odell]]\"; it's \"surreal, disturbing, strong meat for young stomachs.\"<ref>{{cite web |first=Peter |last= Bradshaw| title= The 5,000 Fingers Of Dr T| url= https://www.theguardian.com/film/2002/mar/29/culture.reviews6 |date=March 28, 2002 | work=The Guardian |access-date=2014-08-02}}</ref>  In 2005, Violet Glaze of the ''[[Baltimore City Paper]]'' called the film \"refreshingly tart and defiant for a children's film, its [[Space Age|space-age]]-by-way-of-[[The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari|Caligari]] world parks right on the delicious side of creepy.
