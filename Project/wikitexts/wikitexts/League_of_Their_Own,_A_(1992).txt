She sees many former teammates and friends, prompting a flashback to 1943.\n\nWhen [[World War II]] threatens to shut down [[Major League Baseball]], [[Chicago Cubs]] owner Walter Harvey persuades his fellow owners to bankroll a women's league. Ira Lowenstein is put in charge. Scout Ernie Capadino attends an industrial-league softball game in [[Oregon]] and likes what he sees in Dottie, the catcher for a local dairy. She is happy with her life while waiting for her husband Bob to return from the war. Her younger sister Kit, however, is desperate to get away and make something of herself. Capadino is unimpressed by Kit's batting and refuses to evaluate her pitching, but agrees to take her along if she changes Dottie's mind. Dottie agrees for her sister's sake.\n\nDottie and Kit travel to [[Wrigley Field|Harvey Field]] in Chicago for the tryout. They meet [[taxi dancer]] Mae \"All the Way Mae\" Mordabito and her best friend, bouncer Doris Murphy, soft-spoken right fielder Evelyn Gardner, illiterate left fielder Shirley Baker, pitcher/shortstop and former Miss Georgia beauty queen Ellen Sue Gotlander, left field/relief pitcher Betty \"Spaghetti\" Horn, second baseperson Marla Hooch, first baseperson Helen Haley, and superstitious Alice \"Skeeter\" Gaspers. They and five others are selected to form the [[Rockford Peaches]], while 48 others make up the [[Racine Belles]], [[Kenosha Comets]], and [[South Bend Blue Sox]].\n\nThe Peaches are managed by former star Cubs slugger Jimmy Dugan, a cynical alcoholic. He initially treats the whole thing as a joke, forcing Dottie to take over as on-field leader for much of the early part of the season. Dugan is also abrasive toward his players. The team travels with Evelyn's spoiled bratty son Stillwell and tightly wound team chaperone Miss Cuthburt. With a [[Life (magazine)|''Life'']] magazine photographer in the stands, Lowenstein begs the players to do something spectacular, as the league has attracted little attention. Dottie obliges, catching a popped-up ball behind home plate while doing a [[Split (gymnastics)|split]]. The resulting photograph makes the magazine cover. A publicity campaign draws more people to the ballgames, but the owners remain unconvinced.\n\nThe teammates bond. Marla marries a man named Nelson whom she met on a raucous roadhouse outing and leaves the team, Mae teaches Shirley to read, and Evelyn writes a team song. As Dottie is made the face of the league, Kit becomes resentful and their sibling rivalry intensifies, resulting in Kit's trade to the Racine Belles.\n\nThe Peaches end the season with the league's best record, qualifying for the World Series. Jimmy gives Betty a telegram informing her that her husband was killed in action in the [[Pacific War|Pacific Theater]]. Grief-stricken, she leaves the team. That evening, Dottie receives a surprise when Bob shows up, having been wounded and discharged from the Army. Jimmy discovers that Dottie is going home with Bob. Unable to persuade her to play in the World Series, he tells her she will regret her decision.\n\nThe Peaches face the Belles in the World Series, which goes the full seven games. Dottie rejoins the Peaches for the seventh game, while Kit is the starting pitcher for the Belles. With the Belles leading by a run in the top of the ninth, Dottie drives in the go-ahead run. Kit is distraught, but gets a second chance when she comes to bat with two outs in the bottom of the ninth. She gets a hit and ignoring the third base coach's sign to stop, scores the winning run by knocking her sister over at the plate and dislodging the ball from Dottie's hand.\n\nThe sellout crowd convinces Harvey to give Lowenstein the owners' support. After the game, the sisters reconcile before Dottie leaves with Bob.\n\nIn the present, Dottie is reunited with the other players, including Kit, as well as Capadino and Lowenstein, but she learns from an older Stillwell that Evelyn is dead. Bob and Dugan are revealed to be dead too. The surviving Peaches sing Evelyn's team song and pose for a photo. During the closing credits, they play baseball at Doubleday Field.\n\n==Cast==\n\n===Rockford Peaches===\n{{div col}}\n* [[Tom Hanks]] as Jimmy Dugan (manager)\n* [[Geena Davis]] as Dorothy \"Dottie\" Hinson (#8, catcher/assistant manager)\n** [[Lynn Cartwright]] as Older Dottie\n* [[Madonna]] as \"All the Way\" Mae Mordabito (#5, center field)\n** [[Eunice Anderson]] as Older Mae\n* [[Lori Petty]] as Kit Keller (#23, pitcher)\n** Kathleen Butler as Older Kit\n* [[Rosie O'Donnell]] as Doris Murphy (#22, third base)\n** Vera Johnson as Older Doris\n* [[Anne Ramsay]] as Helen Haley (#15, first base)\n** Barbara Pilavin as Older Helen\n* [[Megan Cavanagh]] as Marla Hooch (#32, second base)\n** Patricia Wilson as Older Marla\n* Freddie Simpson as Ellen Sue Gotlander (#1, shortstop/pitcher)\n** Eugenia McLin as Older Ellen Sue\n* [[Tracy Reiner]] as Betty \"Spaghetti\" Horn (#7, left field/relief pitcher)\n** Betty Miller as Older Betty\n* [[Bitty Schram]] as Evelyn Gardner (#17, right field)\n* [[Ren\u00e9e Coleman]] (credited as Renee Coleman) \u2013 Alice \"Skeeter\" Gaspers (#18, left field/center field/catcher)\n** [[Shirley Burkovich]] as Older Alice\n* [[Ann Cusack]] as Shirley Baker (#11, left field)\n** Barbara Erwin as Older Shirley\n* Robin Knight as Linda \"Beans\" Babbitt (shortstop)\n* Patti Pelton as Marbleann Wilkinson (second base)\n* Kelli Simpkins as Beverly Dixon (#4, outfield)\n* Connie Pounds-Taylor as Connie Calhoun (Outfield)\n{{div col end}}\n\n===Others===\n{{div col}}\n* [[Jon Lovitz]] as Ernie Capadino, AAGPBL scout\n* [[David Strathairn]] as Ira Lowenstein, AAGPBL general manager\n** Marvin Einhorn as Older Ira\n* [[Garry Marshall]] as Walter Harvey, candy bar mogul and AAGPBL founder (Based on [[Philip K.
