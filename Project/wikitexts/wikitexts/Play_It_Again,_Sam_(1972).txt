The film was directed by [[Herbert Ross]], instead of Allen, who usually directs his own written work.\n\nThe film is about a recently divorced film critic, Allan Felix, who is urged to begin dating again by his best friend and his best friend's wife.  Allan identifies with the 1942 film ''[[Casablanca (film)|Casablanca]]'' and the character Rick Blaine as played by [[Humphrey Bogart]]. The film is liberally sprinkled with clips from the movie and ghost-like appearances of Bogart ([[Jerry Lacy]]) giving advice on how to treat women.\n\n==Plot==\nSet in [[San Francisco]], ''Play It Again, Sam'' begins with the closing scenes of ''[[Casablanca (film)|Casablanca]]'', with [[Humphrey Bogart]] and [[Ingrid Bergman]]. The main character, Allan Felix, is seen watching the film in a cinema, mouth agape. He leaves the cinema regretting that he will never be like Rick.\n\nApart from apparitions of Bogart, Allan also has frequent flashbacks of conversations with his ex-wife, Nancy, who constantly ridiculed his sexual inadequacy. Allan has just been through a messy divorce. His best friend, Dick Christie, and Dick's wife, Linda, try to convince him to go out with women again, setting him up on a series of blind dates, all of which turn out badly. Throughout the film, he is seen receiving dating advice from the ghost of Bogart, who is visible and audible only to Allan. Allan's ex-wife Nancy also makes fantasy appearances, as he imagines conversations with her about the breakdown of their marriage. On one occasion, the fantasy seems to run out of control, with both Bogart and Nancy appearing.\n\nWhen it comes to women, he attempts to become sexy and sophisticated, in particular he tries to be like his idol, Bogart, only to end up ruining his chances by being too clumsy.  Eventually, he develops feelings for Linda, around whom he feels relatively at ease and does not feel the need to put on the mask. At the point where he finally makes his move on Linda (aided by comments from Bogart), a vision of his ex-wife appears and shoots Bogart, leaving him without advice. He then makes an awkward move. Linda runs off but returns, realizing that Allan loves her. The song \"[[As Time Goes By (song)|As Time Goes By]]\" and flashes from ''Casablanca'' accompany their kiss.\n\nHowever, their relationship is doomed, just as it was for Rick and Ilsa in ''Casablanca''. Dick returns early from Cleveland and confides to Allan that he thinks Linda is having an affair, not realizing that her affair is with Allan. Dick expresses to Allan his love for Linda.\n\nThe ending is an allusion to ''Casablanca'''s famous ending.  Dick is catching a flight to Cleveland, Linda is after him, and Allan is chasing Linda.  The fog, the aircraft engine start-ups, the trenchcoats, and the dialogue are all reminiscent of the film, as Allan nobly explains to Linda why she has to go with her husband, rather than stay behind with him.\n\nAllan quotes a closing line from ''Casablanca'', saying, \"If that plane leaves the ground and you're not on it, you'll regret it; maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but soon, and for the rest of your life.\" \"That is beautiful\", Linda says, causing Allan to admit, \"It's from ''Casablanca''. ... I've waited my whole life to say it!\"  His journey is complete. Bogart praises him, saying that since he has learned how to be himself now, he doesn't need him for advice anymore. The music from the scene in ''Casablanca'' resumes the theme \"As Time Goes By\", and the film ends.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Woody Allen]] as Allan Felix, a neurotic, recently divorced writer\n* [[Diane Keaton]] as Linda Christie, Dick's wife, with whom Allan falls in love\n* [[Tony Roberts (actor)|Tony Roberts]] as Dick Christie, Allan's best friend and Linda's husband, a workaholic businessman in real estate\n* [[Jerry Lacy]] as [[Humphrey Bogart]]\n* [[Susan Anspach]] as Nancy, Allan's ex-wife\n* [[Jennifer Salt]] as Sharon\n* [[Joy Bang]] as Julie\n* [[Viva (actress)|Viva]] as Jennifer\n\n[[Humphrey Bogart]] and [[Ingrid Bergman]] appear in [[archive footage|archival appearances]] from ''[[Casablanca (film)|Casablanca]]'' as Richard \"Rick\" Blaine and Ilsa Lund respectively.\n\n==Reception==\n''Play It Again, Sam'' received positive reviews.
