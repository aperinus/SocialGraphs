It stars [[Wendy Hiller]] and [[Roger Livesey]], and features [[Pamela Brown (actress)|Pamela Brown]] and [[Finlay Currie]].\n\n==Plot==\nJoan Webster is a 25-year-old middle-class Englishwoman with an ambitious, independent spirit. She knows where she's going, or at least she thinks she does. She travels from her home in [[Manchester]] to the [[Hebrides]] to marry Sir Robert Bellinger, a wealthy, much older industrialist, on the (fictitious) Isle of Kiloran.\n\nWhen bad weather postpones the final leg of her journey (the boat trip to Kiloran), she is forced to wait it out on the [[Isle of Mull]], among a community of people whose values are quite different from hers. There she meets Torquil MacNeil, a naval officer trying to go home to Kiloran while on [[shore leave]]. They are sheltered for the night in the nearby home of Torquil's friend, Catriona Potts.\n\nThe next day, on their way to catch a bus to [[Tobermory, Mull|Tobermory]] to find a telephone, they come upon the ruins of [[Moy Castle]]. Joan wants to take a look inside, but Torquil refuses to go in. When she reminds him that the terrible curse associated with it only applies to the [[laird]] of Kiloran, Torquil introduces himself: he ''is'' the laird, and Bellinger has only leased his island. On the bus, the locals recount several disparaging stories about Bellinger. At the coastguard station in Tobermory, Joan is able to contact Bellinger on Kiloran. She and Torquil stay at the Western Isles Hotel in Tobermory. She asks him to eat at separate tables to avert gossip. As the bad weather worsens into a full-scale gale, Torquil spends more time with Joan, who becomes increasingly torn between her ambition and her growing attraction to him.\n\nFrom there, they go to [[Achnacroish]], where Joan is surprised to re-encounter Torquil, who feigns not to know her in the presence of others. They attend a [[ceilidh]] celebrating a diamond wedding anniversary. The pipers at the ceilidh are there by default as they are also trapped en route to Kiloran and were to play at Joan's wedding.\n\nJoan suggests to Catriona that she could sell her property to get money. Catriona says, \"money isn't everything\".\n\nDesperate to salvage her carefully laid plans, Joan tries to persuade Ruairidh Mh\u00f3r to take her to Kiloran immediately, but he knows conditions are far too dangerous. Joan manages to bribe young Kenny into attempting it by offering him \u00a320: enough money to buy a half-share in Ruairidh's boat and marry Ruairidh's daughter Bridie. Torquil learns of the scheme and tries to talk Joan out of it, but she is adamant. When Catriona tells Torquil that Joan is actually running away from him, he races to the quayside and invites himself aboard. En route, the boat's engine is flooded and they are nearly caught in the [[Gulf of Corryvreckan|Corryvreckan whirlpool]], but Torquil is able to restart the motor just in time, and they return safely to Mull.\n\nAt last the weather clears. Joan asks Torquil for a parting kiss before they go their separate ways. Torquil enters Moy Castle, and the curse takes effect almost immediately. Centuries earlier, Torquil's ancestor had stormed the castle to capture his unfaithful wife and her lover. He had them bound together and cast into a water-filled dungeon with only a small stone to stand on. When their strength gave out, they dragged each other into the water, but not before she placed a curse on the lairds of Kiloran. From the [[battlement]]s, Torquil sees Joan, accompanied by three bagpipers, marching resolutely toward him. They meet in the castle, and embrace. An inscription describes the curse: if a MacNeil of Kiloran dares step over the threshold of Moy, he shall be chained to a woman to the end of his days, \"and will die in his chains\".\n\nTorquil and Joan walk away together along the lane arm in arm. \"[[I Know Where I'm Going (folk song)|I Know Where I'm Going]]\" is sung as the end credits roll.\n\n==Cast==\n\n* [[Wendy Hiller]] as Joan Webster\n* [[Roger Livesey]] as Torquil MacNeil aka Kiloran\n* [[Pamela Brown (actress)|Pamela Brown]] as Catriona Potts\n* [[Finlay Currie]] as Ruairidh Mh\u00f3r\n* [[George Carney]] as Mr Webster\n* [[Nancy Price]] as Mrs Crozier\n* [[Catherine Lacey]] as Mrs Robinson, a chatterbox friend of Bellinger's who is on holiday in the area\n* [[Jean Cadell]] as the Postmistress\n* [[John Laurie]] as John Campbell, son of the couple whose [[Diamond Jubilee|diamond anniversary]] [[c\u00e9ilidh]] Torquil and Joan attend\n* [[Valentine Dyall]] as Mr. Robinson, a business associate of Bellinger's and Mrs. Robinson's husband\n* [[Norman Shelley]] as Sir Robert Bellinger (voice)\n* Margot Fitzsimons as Bridie\n* Murdo Morrison as Kenny\n* Captain [[C.W.R.

(Technicolor cameras and technical specialists were mostly in Hollywood during the Second World War.)\n\nPressburger suggested that instead they make a film that was part of the \"crusade against materialism\", a theme they had tackled in ''A Canterbury Tale'', only in a more accessible romantic comedy format.<ref>MacDonald p 242</ref>\n\nThe story was originally called ''The Misty Island''. Pressburger wanted to make a film about a girl who wants to get to an island, but by the end of the film no longer wants to. Powell suggested an island on Scotland's west coast. He and Pressburger spent several weeks researching locations and decided on the Isle of Mull.\n\nPressburger wrote the screenplay in four days. \"It just burst out, you couldn't hold back,\" he said.<ref>{{Cite book | author = Kevin Macdonald | author-link = Kevin Macdonald (director) | title = Emeric Pressburger: The Life and Death of a Screenwriter | page = [https://archive.org/details/emericpressburge00macd/page/243 243] | year = 1994 | publisher = [[Faber and Faber]] | isbn = 978-0-571-16853-8 | url-access = registration | url = https://archive.org/details/emericpressburge00macd/page/243 }}</ref>\n\nThe movie was originally meant to star [[Deborah Kerr]] and [[James Mason]] but Kerr could not get out of her contract with MGM, so they cast Wendy Hiller.<ref>MacDonald p 245</ref> Hiller was originally cast in the three roles Kerr played in ''The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp'' but had to withdraw because she got pregnant.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article59326759 |title=Ginger Rogers' Return to Musical Comedy|newspaper=[[Sunday Times (Perth)]] |issue=2442 |location=Western Australia |date=3 December 1944 |access-date=29 October 2017 |page=11 (SUPPLEMENT TO \"THE SUNDAY TIMES\") |via=[[National Library of Australia]]}}</ref><ref name=\"sight\">Powell and Pressburger: the war years\nBadder, David.

[[Roger Livesey]] read the script and asked to play the role. Powell thought he was too old and portly but Livesey lost \"ten or twelve pounds\" (four or five kilos) and lightened his hair; Powell was convinced,<ref>Powell (1986) p 476</ref> but Livesey was appearing in a [[West End theatre|West End]] play, ''The Banbury Nose'', during the shoot, so he was unable to go on location.<ref>MacDonald p 243</ref>\n\n===Filming===\nShooting took place on the Isle of Mull and at Denham Studios.\n\nIt was the second and last collaboration between the co-directors and [[cinematographer]] [[Erwin Hillier]] (who shot the entire film without a [[light meter]]).<ref name=\"IKWIG Revisited\">In the documentary ''I Know Where I'm Going Revisited'' (1994) on the Criterion DVD</ref>\n\nFrom various topographical references and a map briefly shown in the film, it is clear that the Isle of Kiloran is based on [[Colonsay]]. The name Kiloran was borrowed from one of Colonsay's bays, Kiloran Bay. The heroine of the film is trying to get to \"Kiloran\" (Colonsay), but nobody ever gets there. No footage was shot on Colonsay.\n\nOne of the most complex scenes shows the small boat battling the Corryvreckan whirlpool. This was a combination of footage shot at Corryvreckan between the Hebridean islands of [[Scarba]] and [[Jura, Scotland|Jura]], and Bealach a'Choin Ghlais ([[Sound (geography)|Sound]] of the Grey Dogs) between Scarba and [[Lunga, Firth of Lorn|Lunga]].<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.whirlpool-scotland.co.uk/ | title = The Corryvreckan Whirlpool - Scotland's maelstrom | access-date=17 January 2020}}</ref>\n*There are some long-distance shots looking down over the area, shot from one of the islands.\n*There are some middle-distance and close-up shots that were made from a small boat with a hand-held camera.\n*There were some model shots, done in the tank at the studio. These had gelatin added to the water so that it would hold its shape better and would look better when scaled up. \n*The close-up shots of the people in the boat were all done in the studio, with a boat on gimbals being rocked in all directions by some hefty studio hands while others threw buckets of water at them. These were filmed with the shots made from the boat with the hand-held camera projected behind them.\n*Further trickery joined some of the long- and middle-distance shots together with those made in the tank into a single frame.<ref name=Powell480>{{cite book|last=Powell|first=Michael|title=A Life in Movies|publisher=[[Heinemann (publisher)|Heinemann]]|location=London|year=1986|page=480|isbn=978-0-434-59945-5}}</ref>\n\nThough much of the film was shot in the Hebrides, Livesey was not able to travel to Scotland because he was performing in a [[West End theatre|West End]] play, ''The Banbury Nose'' by [[Peter Ustinov]], at the time of filming. Thus all his scenes were shot in the studio at [[Denham Film Studios|Denham]], and a double (coached by Livesey in London) was used in all of his scenes shot in Scotland. These were then mixed so that the same scene would often have a middle-distance shot of the double and then a closeup of Livesey, or a shot of the double's back followed by a shot showing Livesey's face.<ref>Powell (1986): 476</ref>\n\nThe film was budgeted at [[Pound sterling|\u00a3]]200,000 ({{Inflation|UK|200000|1945|r=0|fmt=eq|cursign=\u00a3}}) and went \u00a330,000 over. The actors received \u00a350,000, of which one third went to Hiller. The whirlpool cost \u00a340,000.<ref>MacDonald</ref>\n\nPowell shot a scene at the end of the film where Catriona follows Torquil into the castle, to emphasise her love for him, but decided to cut it.<ref name=\"sight\"/>\n\n===Music===\nJohn Laurie was the choreographer and arranger for the [[c\u00e8ilidh]] sequences.<ref>Powell (1986: 537\u2013538)</ref> The [[puirt \u00e0 beul]] \"Macaphee\"<ref>[http://www.powell-pressburger.org/Reviews/45_IKWIG/Macaphee.html Macaphee song]</ref> was performed by Boyd Steven, Maxwell Kennedy and Jean Houston of the [[Glasgow Orpheus Choir]].<ref>{{cite web |title=I Know Where I&#039;m Going!; (1945) |url=https://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b6ace5f91 |publisher=[[British Film Institute]] |access-date=11 December 2019 |language=en}}</ref> The song sung at the c\u00e8ilidh that Torquil translates for Joan is a traditional [[Scottish Gaelic|Gaelic]] song \"Ho ro, mo nighean donn bh\u00f2idheach\", originally translated into English as \"Ho ro My Nut Brown Maiden\" by [[John Stuart Blackie]] in 1882.
