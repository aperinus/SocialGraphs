The film showcases the then-new technology of [[nuclear submarine]]s, and follows the crew and scientists aboard the atomic-powered USS ''Tigershark'', which has been ordered to hunt down the mysterious underwater saucer and stop its disruption of sea commerce.\n{{TOC limit|limit=2}}\n\n==Plot==\n<!--Per WP:FILMPLOT, this section should always fall between 400-700 words.-->\nA submarine is destroyed near the [[North Pole]] by a mysterious undersea light. The loss of this and several other ships in the Arctic alarms the world. Governments temporarily close the polar route and convene an emergency meeting at [[the Pentagon]]. Present is [[Commander (United States)|Commander]] Dan Wendover (Dick Foran), the [[Captain (naval)|captain]] of the atomic submarine ''Tigershark'', and [[Nobel Prize]]-winning scientist Sir Ian Hunt (Tom Conway). The [[United States Secretary of Defense]] ([[Jack Mulhall]]) leads the meeting; he explains all that is known about the [[Arctic Ocean|Arctic]] disasters, and then describes the high-tech capabilities of ''Tigershark''. These include a special hull and a minisub (''Lungfish'') that can be stored inside the submarine. The secretary finishes by telling Wendover that he is to take Hunt, ''Tigershark'', and her crew to resolve the ship sinkings, and if possible, eliminate their cause.\n\n[[Lieutenant Commander (United States)|Lieutenant Commander]] Richard \"Reef\" Holloway (Arthur Franz), ''Tigershark''{{'}}s [[executive officer]], learns that his bunkmate is to be Dr. Carl Neilson Jr. (Brett Halsey), a pacifistic scientist whom he dislikes. A [[montage (filmmaking)|montage]] then follows, spotlighting the day-to-day life aboard ''Tigershark'', which eventually discovers the cause of the disasters, an underwater [[flying saucer|saucer-shaped]] craft with a sole light atop its upper dome. One of ''Tigershark''{{'}}s scientists, Dr. Clifford Kent (Victor Varconi), briefly shows a photo of an [[unidentified flying object]], pointing out its similarity to this underwater UFO. The submariners begin to realize that their quarry is extraterrestrial. The crew nicknames the saucer \"[[Cyclops]]\" because of its single light.\n\nCommander Wendover orders the submarine's most powerful torpedoes fired. They reach the saucer, but do not explode, being stopped by a gel-like extrusion coming from within the UFO. The captain orders ''Tigershark'' to ram the alien saucer. The submarine's bow tip breaks through its lower side and becomes trapped.\n\nDr. Neilson pilots ''Lungfish'', taking Lt. Commander Holloway and a small party to board the UFO. Holloway has the boarding party cut free the bow with [[blow torch]]es. Meanwhile, he explores the saucer's dark hallways after receiving telepathic messages from its sole occupant, an octopus-like creature with a single, very large eye. The alien kills all the boarding party except Holloway. The creature explains that, unlike humanity, what they create is made of living tissue. The saucer is a living creature and (as Holloway understands) is healing. The creature announces that it plans on bringing Holloway and several other specimens back to its home [[exoplanet|planet]] for further study. The aliens plan to modify themselves, based on what they learn about the human specimens. Once finished, they will return to colonize Earth.\n\nHolloway attacks by firing a [[Very pistol]] into the alien's single eye, temporarily blinding it. While the eye rapidly heals, Holloway races back to ''Lungfish'' and returns to the ''Tigershark''. When Dr. Neilson asks about the remainder of their boarding party, Holloway says, \"Fortunes of war\".\n\nThe now-healed saucer sails to the North Pole to recharge its energy in preparation for leaving. Holloway tells Wendover, \"Captain, if that thing ever gets back to where it came from, the Earth and everyone on it is doomed\".\n\nThe submariners hold an emergency meeting of ''Tigershark''{{'}}s on-board scientists, and they develop a plan to adapt a torpedo's guidance system to convert it into a guided water-to-air missile. When the saucer rises from the ocean, ''Tigershark'' fires the missile, destroying the UFO. Holloway and the young Neilson are reconciled, with the latter realizing that his pacifism was no match for a hostile alien.<ref>[https://archive.org/details/theatomicsubmarine1959 Internet Archive]</ref>\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Arthur Franz]] as Lieutenant Commander Richard 'Reef' Holloway\n* [[Dick Foran]] as Commander Dan Wendover\n* [[Brett Halsey]] as Dr. Carl Neilson\n* [[Paul Dubov]] as Lieutenant David Milburn\n* [[Bob Steele (actor)|Bob Steele]] as CPO 'Grif' Griffin\n* [[Victor Varconi]] as Dr. Clifford Kent\n* [[Joi Lansing]] as Julie\n* [[Selmer Jackson]] as Admiral Terhune\n* [[Jack Mulhall]] as Secretary of Defense Justin Murdock\n* [[Jean Moorhead]] as Helen Milburn\n* [[Dick Tyler|Richard Tyler]] as Seaman Don Carney\n* [[Sid Melton]] as Yeoman Chester Tuttle\n* Kenneth Becker as Seaman Al Powell\n* Frank Watkins as Watkins\n* [[Tom Conway]] as Sir Ian Hunt\n* [[John Kenneth Hilliard|John Hilliard]] as Voice of Spaceman\n* Pat Michaels as Narrator\n\n==Production==\nPrincipal photography for ''The Atomic Submarine'' took place from mid-June to early July 1959.<ref>[http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/67768/The-Atomic Submarine/original-print-info.html \"Original print information: The Atomic Submarine.\"] ''Turner Classic Movies''.

Chief among the unusual elements is \"a headier-than-expected socio-political debate between a young principled pacifist and the career military man and WWII veteran sub captain over the merits of war and peace\".<ref name=\"Criterion\"/>\n\n==Related films==\nTwo later science fiction films also \"starred\" nuclear submarines: the [[USOS Seaview|USOS ''Seaview'']] in [[Irwin Allen]]'s ''[[Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea]]'' (1961)<ref>[https://www.starburstmagazine.com/reviews/dvd-review-the-atomic-submarine STARBURST Magazine]</ref> and the submarine ''Atragon'' in the [[Japan]]ese film ''[[Atragon]]'' (1963). In all three, a high-tech nuclear submarine of the near-future travels to the deepest part of the ocean to save the Earth from destruction.\n\nActor Arthur Franz, who played  Holloway in ''The Atomic Submarine'', guest-starred five years later on an episode of Irwin Allen's 1964 submarine TV series ''[[Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea (TV series)|Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea]]''.\n\n==Availability==\nThe film was released by the [[Criterion Collection]] as part of their \"Monsters and Madmen\" DVD set on January 23, 2007.<ref>[https://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/26303/monsters-and-madmen-criterion-collection/ Monsters and Madmen - Criterion Collection : DVD Talk]</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of films in the public domain in the United States]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{Refbegin}}\n* Meehan, Paul.
