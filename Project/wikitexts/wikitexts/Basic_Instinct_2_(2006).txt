The film was directed by [[Michael Caton-Jones]] and produced by [[Mario Kassar]], [[Joel B. Michaels]], and [[Andrew G. Vajna]]. The screenplay was by Leora Barish and [[Henry Bean]]. It stars [[Sharon Stone]], who reprises her role of crime mystery author [[Catherine Tramell]] (from the original ''Basic Instinct''), and [[David Morrissey]]. The film is an [[international co-production]] of German, British, American, and Spanish producers.\n\nThe film follows novelist and suspected [[serial killer]] Catherine Tramell, who is once again in trouble with the authorities, this time in [[London, England|London]]. Now [[Scotland Yard]] (Greater London's [[Metropolitan Police Service]]) appoints psychiatrist Dr. Michael Glass to evaluate her after. As with SFPD Detective [[Nick Curran (Basic Instinct)|Nick Curran]] in the first film, Dr. Glass becomes a victim of Tramell's psychological manipulation.\n\nAfter being in [[development limbo]] for several years, the sequel film was finally shot in London from April to August 2005, and was released on 31 March 2006. Following numerous cuts, it was released with an [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system|R rating]] for \"strong sexuality, nudity, violence, language, and some drug content\". Unlike its predecessor, the film received extremely negative reviews and flopped at the box office.\n\n== Plot ==\nSet in London, the film opens with American best-selling author Catherine Tramell in a speeding car with her companion, famous English [[association football|football]] star Kevin Franks. Tramell takes Franks's hand and begins masturbating herself with it, simultaneously increasing her vehicle's speed, but the semi-unconscious Franks is seemingly unaware of what is happening. At the point of [[orgasm]], Tramell veers off the road and crashes into the [[West India Docks]] in [[Canary Wharf]] on the [[River Thames]]. She attempts to save Franks, but while being questioned later by the police, she says, \"When it came down to it, I guess my life was more important to me than his.\"\n\nTramell's interrogator, Scotland Yard Detective Superintendent Roy Washburn, notes that [[Tubocurarine|D-tubocurarine]] (DTC), a [[neuromuscular]] blocking agent used to relax muscles during [[general anaesthesia]] for medical surgery, was found in her car and in her companion's body, and the companion was not breathing when the crash occurred (according to the autopsy), and that \"Dicky Pep\" said that he sold Tramell \"15 milliliters of DTC last Thursday\". Tramell counters by saying Dicky Pep must be lying because, \"you've got him on some other charge and he's trying to deal his way out, if he even exists\".\n\nTramell begins therapy sessions with Dr. Michael Glass, who has conducted a court-ordered psychiatric examination and given testimony in her case. Dr. Glass strongly suspects Tramell is a [[Narcissistic personality disorder|narcissist]], unable to differentiate between right and wrong. Tramell begins to manipulate Glass, who becomes increasingly frustrated and intrigued by her. Meanwhile, the journalist boyfriend of Glass's ex-wife, who was writing a story criticising Glass, is found strangled to death. More murders begin to surface around Dr. Glass, including his own ex-wife, as his obsession with Tramell grows; when his career and life are threatened, he begins to suspect that Tramell is really committing the murders and attempting to frame him for them.  Glass increasingly cannot distinguish himself between right and wrong, and the London police begin to suspect him. He confronts Tramell at her apartment, where they have passionate sex. Tramell gives Glass a copy of the draft of her next novel, titled ''The Analyst''. After reading it, he realises that Tramell has novelised most of the recent events, with Glass and herself as characters. A character based on Glass's female colleague, Dr. Milena Gardosh, is depicted as the next murder victim in the novel.\n\nGlass runs to Dr. Gardosh's apartment to warn her, finding Tramell already there. Gardosh informs him that he is no longer in charge of Tramell's therapy and that his license will be revoked. He and Gardosh struggle, and she is knocked unconscious. Tramell then threatens Glass with a gun she carries, but Glass confiscates it from her. When Detective Superintendent Washburn arrives at the scene, Tramell manipulates Dr. Glass into shooting him.\n\nIn the final scene, Tramell visits Dr. Glass, now institutionalised at a local [[mental hospital]], and informs him that the novel has become a best seller. Tramell claims that she manipulated Glass into committing all those murders, and flashbacks are shown of Glass committing the murders. Tramell leaves with a smirk on her face, while Glass continues to sit silently in his wheelchair.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Sharon Stone]] as [[Catherine Tramell]]\n* [[David Morrissey]] as Dr. Michael Glass\n* [[Charlotte Rampling]] as Dr. Milena Gardosh\n* [[David Thewlis]] as Roy Washburn\n* [[Indira Varma]] as Denise Glass\n* [[Flora Montgomery]] as Michelle Broadwin\n* [[Heathcote Williams]] as Dr. Jakob Gerst\n* [[Hugh Dancy]] as Adam Towers\n* Anne Caillon as Laney Ward\n* [[Iain Robertson]] as Peter Ristedes\n* [[Stan Collymore]] as Kevin Franks\n* [[Kata Dob\u00f3]] as Magda\n* [[Jan Chappell]] as Angela\n\n== Development ==\nMGM had planned to produce the sequel for release in 2002, but announced in 2001 that they would no longer be making the film.
