The film is a [[autobiography|semi-autobiography]] of poet/author [[Charles Bukowski]] during the time he spent [[alcoholic beverage|drinking]] heavily in [[Los Angeles]], and it presents Bukowski's alter ego [[Henry Chinaski]]. The screenplay, written by Bukowski, was commissioned by the [[French people|French]] film director [[Barbet Schroeder]], and it was published (with illustrations by the author) in 1984, when film production was still pending.<ref>Bukowski, Charles.

An intelligent man and keenly aware of his circumstance, he finds solace in expressing his feelings and perceptions of the world through writing poetry and short stories which he submits to magazines and papers for a few extra dollars.\n\nHenry frequents a bar called The Golden Horn, where he drinks, hangs out with other down and out alcoholics, and gets into altercations with the tough guy bartender he hates, Eddie. One night, Henry gets into a fight with Eddie and loses. The next day, he delivers sandwiches to two patrons in the bar. Realizing he needs to eat before fighting (to gain energy) to win, he grabs the sandwich out of one of the patrons' hands and eats it, disgusting the patron and angering the bar owner, Jim, one of Henry's best friends. Jim tells Henry to go lie down in his apartment for a few hours. After an afternoon nap, Henry steals bread, bologna, and wine from another apartment to eat and drink in preparation to fight Eddie.\n\nHenry returns to The Golden Horn later that evening, and antagonizes Eddie until he finally challenges him to another fight. Henry jumps over the bar and drinks beer out of the tap, infuriating Eddie. Jim puts a wager on Henry to beat Eddie. Henry wins the fight, and is then kicked out of the bar. Jim wins his bet, which he then gives to Henry so that he can buy a couple of drinks for the night.\n\nHenry then staggers on to another establishment down the street called the Kenmore, where he continues his imbibement. There, he meets Wanda, a fellow alcoholic and a [[kept woman]]. Wanda is initially annoyed with Henry, telling him she \"hates people,\" but is intrigued by his sarcastic and witty responses. The two buy liquor at a store across the street, and Wanda then steals corn from a cornfield, attracting the attention of the police. The two run to her apartment, evading them. Wanda boils the corn but discovers it is green and inedible, and then freaks out, saying that nothing in her life ever works out. Henry comforts her.\n\nThe next day, Henry sets out to get a job to finance their booze-soaked life together. Henry then takes Wanda back to The Golden Horn to meet Jim as well as to cash an income tax rebate he received working six months in a toy factory.\n\nHowever, things become acrimonious between Henry and Wanda when Henry discovers that Wanda has slept with Eddie. After he chastises her for it, Wanda beats Henry with her purse, knocking him unconscious. Later, a detective following Henry sees him covered in blood and calls 911. Two paramedics arrive and are unfazed by Henry's being covered in blood, telling him not to waste their time. Wanda returns later, and the two apologize to one another. Later that night, Wanda claims to be dying in bed, seeing angels. Henry calls 911 and the same two paramedics arrive, much to his surprise, and they claim Wanda is just drunk and \"too fat.\"\n\nAfter Wanda leaves to look for a job the next morning, Henry is tracked down by Tully Sorenson, a wealthy female book publisher, who has been impressed with his writing and is interested in publishing some of his work. She finds him through the detective she has hired. Knowing Henry is destitute, Tully pays him an \"advance\" of $500. Henry then breaks into another apartment after hearing a man abusing his wife. After the man threatens to cut his wife's throat, he and Henry get into an altercation which results in the man being stabbed. Henry scrambles out of the apartment building and goes for a drive in L.A. with Tully. At one point, he rams a car where a man and woman are making out while the light is green. Tully tells him he was immature and reckless in his response. She then takes him back to her home where, after drinks, the two sleep together.\n\nAt first, Henry is impressed with the promise of wealth and security, including an endless supply of booze that working for Tully could provide. However, he begins to realize that he is uncomfortable being involved with Tully, romantically or professionally, because of class differences, telling her that she is \"trapped in a cage with golden bars\". Henry determines he must leave, that returning to his life of destitution and alcoholism is the only truth he knows.\n\nAfter leaving Tully's house, Henry returns to his usual bar and to Wanda. Henry buys drinks for all of his \"friends\" at the bar. Eddie suspects Henry has no money and is itching for a fight, so he tells Henry that he owes him $40 for the drinks. To Eddie's surprise, Henry pays with some of the advance he received from Tully and sarcastically leaves a tip for Eddie, saying \"Buy a drink on me.\" Tully heads out to see if she can change his mind, and finds him at the bar where a drunken, jealous Wanda proceeds to beat her up. When Henry does not intercede, Tully realizes that Henry does not care about her and does not want her help. So she leaves the bar and gives up on publishing his work, realizing that her pursuit of him was futile.\n\nEddie calls Henry out, and they go out behind the bar for another fight. As Henry and the other barflies follow Eddie out the door, the camera pans out to the front of the bar to the sound of punches and the crowd cheering the two men.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{Div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Mickey Rourke]] as [[Henry Chinaski]]\n* [[Faye Dunaway]] as Wanda Wilcox\n* [[Alice Krige]] as Tully Sorenson\n* [[Jack Nance]] as Detective\n* J.C.

In an interview in the 2003 documentary film ''Born into This'', Bukowski says that Rourke \"didn't get it right... He had it all kind of exaggerated, untrue. He was a little bit showoff about it. So, no, it was kind of misdone.\u201d Yet the original 1987 press kit for the film included a letter by Bukowski apropos the film, titled \"A Letter from a Fan\", in which the writer stated \"Part of my luck was the actor who played Henry Chinaski. Mickey Rourke stayed with the dialogue to the word and the sound intended. What surprised me was that he added another dimension to the character, in spirit. Mickey appeared to really love his role, and yet without exaggeration he added his own flavor, his zest, his madness, his gamble to Henry Chinaski without destroying the intent or the meaning of the character. To add spirit to spirit can be dangerous but not in the hands of a damned good actor. Without distorting, he added, and I was very pleased with the love and understanding he lent to the role of the BARFLY\".<ref name=\"A Letter from a Fan\">{{cite web|url=http://www.lettersofnote.com/2010/09/barfly-i-love-you.html |title=Barfly, I love you |publisher=Letters of Note |date=2010-09-24 |access-date=2014-07-17}}</ref> Bukowski had confided to the film critic Roger Ebert, in an interview conducted on the set of the film, that he thought Rourke was \"doing a good acting job.
