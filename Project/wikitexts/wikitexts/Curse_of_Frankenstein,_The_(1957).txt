He tells the story of his life to a visiting priest.\n\nAt age 15, the death of Victor's mother leaves him in sole control of the Frankenstein estate. He agrees to continue to pay a monthly allowance to his impoverished aunt Sophia and his young cousin Elizabeth. Soon afterwards, he engages scientist Paul Krempe to tutor him. After two years of intense study, the two begin collaborating on scientific experiments. One night, after a successful experiment in which they bring a dead puppy back to life, Victor suggests that they create a perfect human being from body parts. Paul assists Victor at first but eventually withdraws, unable to tolerate the continued scavenging of human remains, particularly after Victor's fianc\u00e9e\u2014his now grown-up cousin Elizabeth\u2014comes to live with them.\n\nVictor assembles his creation, with a robber's corpse found on a [[gibbeting|gibbet]], and both hands and eyes purchased from [[charnel house]] workers. For the brain, Victor seeks out an ageing and distinguished professor, so that the creature can have a sharp mind and the accumulation of a lifetime of knowledge. He invites the professor to his house in the guise of a friendly visit but pushes him over a stair banister and kills him, making it look like an accident. After the professor is buried, Victor proceeds to the vault and removes his brain. Paul attempts to stop him, and the brain is damaged in the ensuing scuffle. Paul also tries to persuade Elizabeth to leave the house, as he has before, but she refuses.\n\nWith all of the parts assembled, Victor brings the creature to life. Unfortunately, the creature's damaged brain leaves it violent and psychotic, without the professor's intelligence. Victor locks up the creature, but it escapes and kills an old blind man that it encounters in the woods. After Paul shoots the creature in the eye, he and Victor bury it in the woods. However, after Paul leaves town, Victor digs up the creature and brings it back to life. Justine, with whom Victor has been having an affair, claims that she is pregnant by him and threatens to tell the authorities about his strange experiments if he refuses to marry her. He has her killed by the monster.\n\nPaul returns to the house at Elizabeth's invitation the evening before she and Victor are to be married. Victor shows him the revived creature, and Paul threatens to report him to the authorities. The monster escapes up on to the roof where it threatens Elizabeth. Victor arrives with a gun and accidentally shoots Elizabeth after seeing the monster grabbing her. She falls unconscious, and without any more bullets, Victor throws an oil lamp at it, causing it to fall through the roof-light and into a vat of acid, destroying all evidence that it existed.\n\nThe priest does not believe Victor's story. When Paul visits him, Victor begs Paul to testify that it was the creature who killed Justine, but he refuses and denies all knowledge of the mad experiment. Paul joins Elizabeth, who is waiting outside, and tells her there is nothing they can do for Victor. After they leave, Victor is led away to the [[guillotine]].\n\n== Cast ==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Peter Cushing]] as [[Victor Frankenstein|Baron Victor Frankenstein]]\n** [[Melvyn Hayes]] as Young Victor\n* [[Robert Urquhart (actor)|Robert Urquhart]] as Paul Krempe\n* [[Hazel Court]] as [[Elizabeth Lavenza|Elizabeth]]\n** Sally Walsh as Young Elizabeth\n* [[Christopher Lee]] as [[Frankenstein's monster|The Creature]]\n* [[Valerie Gaunt]] as Justine\n* [[Noel Hood]] as Aunt Sophia\n* [[Paul Hardtmuth]] as Professor Bernstein\n* Fred Johnson as Grandpa\n* Alex Gallier as Priest\n* Claude Kingston as Little Boy\n* Michael Mulcaster as Warder\n* Andrew Leigh as Burgomaster\n* Ann Blake as Wife\n* Middleton Woods as Lecturer\n* Raymond Ray as Uncle\n{{Div col end}}\n\n== Production ==\n{{expand section|date=October 2014}}\nProducer [[Max Rosenberg]] originally approached [[Michael Carreras]] at Hammer Films with a deal to produce ''Frankenstein and the Monster'' (Rosenberg claims that he came up with the title) from a script by [[Milton Subotsky]]. Later, both men were cut out of their profit participation making only a $5000 fee for bringing the production to Hammer.<ref>Interview with Max Rosenberg for the Blu-ray of \"Asylum\", December 2017</ref> Rosenberg and Subotsky later established [[Amicus Films]], Hammer's main rival in the production of horror films during the 1960s.\n\nScreenwriter Jimmy Sangster, who adapted Mary Shelley's novel for Hammer, never mentioned seeing Subotsky's script or being aware of Rosenberg's involvement. Sangster had worked as a production manager and said that he was keenly aware of production costs and kept the budget in mind when writing the script. Sangster said that his awareness of cost influenced him to not write scenes involving the villagers storming the castle that was typically seen in the Universal horror films \"because we couldn't afford it\". Sangster in an interview with film historian Jonathan Rigby indicated that he hadn't seen any of the Frankenstein films that Universal made. He just adapted the book \"the way I saw it\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://historyproject.org.uk/interview/jimmy-sangster|title=The British Entertainment History Project - Jimmy Sangster -|website=historyproject.org.uk|access-date=31 December 2017|archive-date=31 December 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171231212052/https://historyproject.org.uk/interview/jimmy-sangster|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nPeter Cushing, who was then best known for his many high-profile roles in British television, had his first lead part in a movie with this film. Meanwhile, Christopher Lee's casting resulted largely from his height (6' 5\"), though Hammer had earlier considered the even taller (6 '7\") [[Bernard Bresslaw]] for the role. Hammer refrained from duplicating aspects of Universal's [[Frankenstein (1931 film)|1931 film]], and so it was down to make-up artist [[Phil Leakey]] to design a new look for the creature bearing no resemblance to the [[Boris Karloff]] original created by [[Jack Pierce (makeup artist)|Jack Pierce]].
