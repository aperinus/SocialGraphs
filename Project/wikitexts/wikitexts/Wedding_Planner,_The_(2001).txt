Ellis|Michael Ellis]] and Pamela Falk, and starring [[Jennifer Lopez]] and [[Matthew McConaughey]].\n\n==Plot==\nAmbitious [[San Francisco]] wedding planner Mary Fiore is re-introduced to childhood acquaintance Massimo by her father Salvatore, who wants them to marry, but Mary declines. Hoping to persuade her boss, Geri, to make her a partner at their company, Mary is hired to plan catering heiress Fran Donolly's society wedding to long-term boyfriend \"Eddie\". While reporting her success on the phone, Mary's shoe heel gets stuck in a manhole cover. As she struggles to free herself, a taxicab collides with a dumpster which comes hurtling towards her. A nearby man pulls her out of the way of the speeding dumpster just in time, and she manages to thank him before fainting.\n\nWaking up in the hospital, Mary meets her rescuer, [[Pediatrics|pediatrician]] Steve Edison. Her colleague Penny persuades Steve to attend an outdoor movie with them, but makes up an excuse to leave the pair alone together. Mary and Steve dance, but are interrupted by a heavy downpour before they can kiss.\n\nAt a dance lesson with a client, Mary encounters Fran, who introduces her to her fianc\u00e9 \"Eddie\", none other than Steve. Fran leaves them to dance together, and Mary angrily rebukes Steve for leading her on behind Fran's back.\n\nPenny persuades Mary that her career is more important than her feelings and to continue planning Fran and Steve's wedding, and Steve's colleague assures him that his connection with Mary is only due to pre-wedding nerves.\n\nOn a visit to a potential wedding venue in [[Napa Valley]], Massimo appears and, to Mary's horror, introduces himself as her fianc\u00e9. While riding through the estate with Fran's parents, Mrs. Donelly's singing frightens Mary's horse. Steve rescues Mary again and admonishes her for condemning his actions when she was also engaged.\n\nAt home, Mary scolds her father for trying to set her up with Massimo. Salvatore reveals that his marriage to her mother, which Mary has viewed as the perfect relationship, was arranged and only became a loving relationship months later, leaving Mary conflicted.\n\nWhile visiting another potential venue, Fran reveals she is going on a week-long business trip and leaves Mary and Steve to continue preparations. They apologize for their angry words, and soon become friends. They run into Wendy and Keith, whom Mary reveals was once her fianc\u00e9 until she caught him cheating with Wendy, his secret high-school girlfriend, on the night of their rehearsal dinner.\n\nAfter getting drunk and struggling to get back into her apartment, Mary breaks down, lamenting that Keith is married and expecting a baby while she is alone and miserable. Steve manages to get Mary inside and comforts her as she sobers up, insisting that Keith was a fool to pick Wendy over her. Steve leaves, but quickly returns and confesses his feelings for Mary. She sadly replies that she respects Fran too much to let anything happen between them, and sends Steve away.\n\nFran confesses to Mary that she is unsure if she is still in love with Steve. Ignoring her own heart, Mary convinces Fran to continue with the wedding. At a birthday party, Massimo offers Mary a heartfelt proposal and she reluctantly accepts; the two couples prepare for their same-day weddings. Leaving Penny to coordinate the Donelly wedding, Mary goes to marry Massimo at the town hall. Steve asks Fran if they are doing the right thing, and she admits that she does not want to get married. They part as friends, Fran leaving to enjoy their honeymoon alone. Penny reveals Mary's marriage plans to Steve, and he rushes to stop her.\n\nAt the town hall, Massimo and Mary prepare to marry but her father stops the ceremony, realizing the wedding is not what Mary wants. Mary, having given up on true love, insists that life is not a fairy tale and marrying Massimo is the right thing to do, but realizes he is not the one for her and leaves.\n\nSteve arrives to find Salvatore and Massimo, who reveals that he could not go ahead with the wedding knowing Mary was actually in love with Steve. Steve reveals his feelings to Salvatore, who tells him to go and get her. Steve and Massimo ride off on Massimo's scooter to the park, where another outdoor movie is starting. Steve finds Mary, asks her to dance, and they kiss.\n\n==Cast==\n<!-- Cast and order per opening tombstone credits, roles per closing credits scroll -->\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Jennifer Lopez]] as Mary Fiore \n* [[Matthew McConaughey]] as Steve Edison\n* [[Bridgette Wilson|Bridgette Wilson-Sampras]] as Fran Donelly\n* [[Justin Chambers]] as Massimo Lenzetti\n* [[Judy Greer]] as Penny Nicholson\n* [[Alex Rocco]] as Salvatore Fiore\n* [[Joanna Gleason]] as Mrs. Donelly\n* [[Charles Kimbrough]] as Mr. Donelly\n* [[Fred Willard]] as Basil St. Mosely\n* [[Lou Myers (actor)|Lou Myers]] as Burt Weinberg\n* [[Frances Bay]] as Dottie\n* [[Kevin Pollak]] as Dr. John Dojny\n* [[Kathy Najimy]] as Geri\n}}\n\n==Production==\n\n=== Casting ===\nThe original actors set to play Mary and Steve were [[Jennifer Love Hewitt]] and [[Brendan Fraser]], respectively.
