Somewhere on the island of [[Isla Escudo de Veraguas|Escudo]] off the coast of [[Panama]], a male [[pygmy three-toed sloth]]s settles on a [[mangrove]] tree from whence he heard a female sloth's mating call. The male sloth ventures off to find the call emanating as he swims across the sea before encountering a mother and her cub while continuing his search for a lone female. On the [[Komodo (island)|Komodo]] island of [[Indonesia]], male [[Komodo dragon]]s compete with each other to earn the sole mating right. Isolated from the continent of Africa, [[Madagascar]] provides a home to several species of lemur which includes [[indri]]s, [[ring-tailed lemur]]s, [[bamboo lemur]]s, and [[sifaka]]s. At the [[Fernandina Island]] of the [[Gal\u00e1pagos Islands|Gal\u00e1pagos]], a newly hatched [[marine iguana]] miraculously escapes from the clutches of predatory [[Galapagos racer]]s before joining the adults. From the sub-Antarctic of [[New Zealand]], [[Snares penguin]]s perform their sub-breeding season, [[Subantarctic shearwater|shearwater]]s fly off to collect food for their young, and a male [[Buller's albatross]] tries to find a female to mate with and succeeds. A female [[white tern]] from [[Seychelles]] nestles her egg on a bare branch and incubates it while [[Brown noddy|brown noddie]]s settle their nest on a [[Pisonia sechellarum|pisonia]] tree. A [[Seychelles fody]] consumes the tern's egg and the young noddy is entangled by the pisonia's seeds. Located on the [[Indian Ocean]], [[Christmas Island]] is infested with numerous species of crabs, including a cast of million [[Christmas Island red crab]]s as they migrate across the island to reach the feeding shore. Some are attacked by a swarm of invasive [[yellow crazy ant]]s. Millions of [[chinstrap penguin]]s settle on an isolated volcanic island called the [[Zavodovski Island]] off the coast of the [[Southern Ocean]], enduring hostile environments such as extreme mass waves, violent storms, ravaging [[skuas]], and noxious volcanic gases. The mother penguin guards her chicks against the skuas while her partner returns to them with food after his fifty miles journey from fishing before she switches places.\n\nThe ''Planet Earth II Diaries'' explains the teams' one-year expedition camp on Zavodovski Island while filming penguins before they departed from harsh weather.\n |LineColor       = #000000\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 2\n |Title           = Mountains\n |Aux1            = Justin Anderson\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2016|11|13|df=y}}\n |Viewers         =  13.14\n |ShortSummary    =\n\nThe second episode starts with the [[Himalayas]] where endangered [[snow leopards]] roam across the range for survival. Across the steep sun-baked mountains of the [[Arabian Peninsula]], [[Nubian ibex]]es settles on the steepest cliff to raise their young while avoiding predators. The ibexes climb down the slope to drink while the kids learn to evade [[Arabian red fox]]es. A female [[golden eagle]] glides 100 miles across the [[Alps]] slopes in a single day to find food in winter before spotting fox carrion, infested with scavenging crows, that can sustain her days. However, the carrion attracts other eagles forcing her to continue her search. Meanwhile, thousands of [[avalanche]]s from the [[Rocky Mountains]] occur every year resulting in catastrophic effects of debris; [[grizzly bear]]s make their dens for hibernation at 10,000 feet in the deep snow of leeward slope. In spring, a mother bear and her cubs descend into the valley in search of food and to evade avalanche debris. As [[marmot]]s make warning calls, the bears scratch themselves on trees, marking their scents before they continue their foraging. Winter in the [[Rocky Mountains|Rockies]] will reach the temperature of at least -54\u00b0 degrees Celsius following the creation of diamond dust. A [[bobcat]] leaves its territory to hunt and finds a suitable valley where the river doesn't freeze and volcanic hot springs where other animals have arrived to feed. From the equator of Africa lies the snowy [[Mount Kenya]] which is 30 degrees colder than the African savanna, and is also the home of [[Erica (plant)|giant heather]]s, [[Lobelia]]s, and [[Dendrosenecio keniodendron|groundsel]]s growing on the upper slope as they adapt hot summer day and freezing night. As the sun rises on the [[Andes]] of [[Bolivia]], [[southern viscacha]]s settle at the sun's ray to get warm while the largest colonies of [[Andean flamingo]]s are trapped in the icy alkali lake at night as they struggle to break free. But as the sun gets hotter, the viscachas retreat towards the shade, and the flamingoes who are immune to the sun's heat start parading across the lake for breeding. Human activities and climate changes start to affect the mountainous ecosystem, resulting in infrastructure buildings in the Alps, shortening hibernation seasons in the Rockies, and melting glaciers in the Andes, including snow decline in the Himalayas. The mother snow leopard and her cub wander through the slope of the Himalayas as the mother marks her scent to avoid detection by male leopards. Despite this, the two males encounter them as the mother tries to fend off the males by diverting their attention resulting in her injuries, allowing her cub to escape and survive. After recovering from injuries and disappearing, the mother reappears as she ventures off on her own while departing her cub who is now old enough to take care of herself, the narrator states that they will soon be reunited before facing their time alone.\n\nThe ''Planet Earth II Diaries'' reveals the team's exploration of the Alps while filming golden eagles. The teams use paragliders to follow the eagle's flight pattern while wearing a helmet camera to focus on the eagle's perspective. Due to unpredictable weather and mountainous terrains, the paragliders face difficult obstacles of avoiding peaks and clouds before they safely land.\n\n |LineColor       = #000000\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 3\n |Title           = Jungles\n |Aux1            = Emma Napper\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2016|11|20|df=y}}\n |Viewers         = 11.60\n |ShortSummary    = \n\nThe third episode introduces the jungle ecosystem that covers less than 6% of the earth's surface, where plants and animals live. An indri roams across the jungles of Madagascar while facing the competition of survival based on niche. High up on the treetops in [[Guatemala]], a curious young [[spider monkey]] gets stuck and is rescued by her father. A young [[Draco (lizard)|Draco lizard]] searches for ants on a tree but larger male challenges him, to which the young male chooses to glide to safety. 300 years ago, a giant [[Hura crepitans|hura tree]] began to grow taller as it races to absorb water and sunlight for survival, which it carries 1000 other plants within its branches. Hundreds of [[hummingbird]] species in [[Ecuador]] compete with each other to feed nectar. [[Sword-billed hummingbird]]s avoid competition with other hummingbirds by using their long beaks to reach the nectar in the deepest flowers which are inaccessible to the other hummingbirds. The rainforest trees provide transpiration as the moisture vaporized causing rainfall, and supporting all life. Deep in the [[Amazon Rainforest]] of [[Brazil]], the trees are suddenly submerged from flooding caused by seasonal rainfall while [[Araguaian river dolphin]]s, a newly discovered species, use their sonars to hunt in the murky waters. Even though the rainfall cause mass flooding, the jungle provides abundant food within a shallow margin for large animals that thrive through lush vegetation like the mighty [[jaguar]], which ambushes and kills a [[caiman]].  Deep in the jungle, animals provide camouflages and mimicry to help evade predators, such as a [[Uroplatus|leaf-tailed gecko]] which disguises itself as lichen. A male [[glass frog]] from [[Costa Rica]] fiercely protects his eggs from predatory [[wasp]]s. Some of the newly hatched tadpoles escape by falling into the stream below. At night, insects glow to search for mates while fungi use bioluminescent light to attract insects like [[click beetle]]s to disperse their spores. A [[railroad worm]] hunts [[millipede]]s by turning off its bioluminescence light and deceive it. Several male [[Red bird-of-paradise|red birds-of-paradise]] dance to attract females on the canopy. Meanwhile, on the forest floor, a solitary [[Wilson's bird-of-paradise]] seeks his mate as he furbishes his 'display court' and successfully impresses a female with his colorful display. Back in Madagascar, the family of indris gather together as they sing to deter other indris from their territory in which the narrator specifies that the Jungle is their sanctuary and their protection for all life on Earth.\n\nThe ''Planet Earth II Diaries'' reveals that the jungle is the least explored place to visit for simple reasons. The teams' exploration of Brazil took them five weeks of finding the rare Araguaian river dolphins while filming them both on the surface and underwater.\n |LineColor       = #000000\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 4\n |Title           = Deserts\n |Aux1            = Ed Charles\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2016|11|27|df=y}}\n |Viewers         = 11.88\n |ShortSummary    =\n\nThe fourth episode focuses on deserts which cover one-third of the planet as plants and animals perform survival strategies. A pride of [[lion]]s in the [[Namib]] desert attempt to hunt a herd of [[gemsbok]] and a [[giraffe]] but fail. In the [[Western United States|American West]], thunderstorms arrive after two months of drought causing multiple floods. Million years ago, the formation of [[slot canyon]]s and mountain-type canyons were the results of ravage floodwaters and soil erosions, making them one of the most iconic landscapes on the planet. In the [[Sonoran Desert]] of [[Arizona]], [[cactus|cacti]] are able to store water within their stems and sport spines for defense. [[Harris's hawk]]s, however, are able to perch on a cactus' spines while hunting [[round-tailed ground squirrel]]s in packs. The [[loggerhead shrike]] or butcherbird hangs its prey on the cactus' spines for storage while dismembering them and feeding them to his offspring. Amongst the driest deserts in [[Peru]], plants began to flourish due to seasonal changes which provide a land of opportunity for all life. In south-west Madagascar, billion swarm of [[migratory locust]]s, caused by heavy rainfall, began to flourish from breeding as they savagely infest the entire area and consume mass amounts of vegetation. In the arid shrublands of the [[Kalahari Desert]], herds of [[plains zebras]] and [[desert elephant]]s gather at a waterhole to drink after their long migration. Male [[sandgrouse]] fly 120 miles every morning to provide water for their families.  They can soak up water in their breast feathers, but also have to escape the talons of a [[gabar goshawk]]. At the [[Mojave Desert]] during [[July]], a herd of wild [[mustang]]s gather at a waterhole. A lead stallion tries to assert dominance over the waterhole but is defeated by a newly rival male. Standing on the scorching dunes, a [[shovel-snouted lizard]] raises each foot off the ground one at a time to cool itself. At night, a nocturnal [[golden mole]] stalks across the sand dunes to locate [[termite]]s with its hearing. In the [[Negev]] desert of [[Israel]], a [[desert long-eared bat]] hunts on the ground, defeating a venomous [[deathstalker]] scorpion after a short confrontation. At dawn, fog from the Atlantic coast is blown over to the dunes, creating a source of moisture. [[Stenocara dentata|Darkwing beetle]]s arrive at the top of the dunes to extract the fog's condensing moisture, which also attract a neighboring [[Pachydactylus rangei|Namib web-footed gecko]] and a hungry [[Namaqua chameleon]].\n\nThe ''Planet Earth II Diaries'' reviews the teams' two weeks encounter with migratory locusts in Madagascar which were easy to find but elusive for filming. With the [[United Nations|UN]]'s [[Food and Agriculture Organization]]'s and localist aid, the team manage to film both the swarms of nymphs and the winged adults.\n\n |LineColor       = #000000\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 5\n |Title           = Grasslands\n |Aux1            = Chadden Hunter\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2016|12|04|df=y}}\n |Viewers         = 11.54\n |ShortSummary    =\n\nThe penultimate episode focuses on grasslands that cover one-quarter of Earth's land. At the [[Terai\u2013Duar savanna and grasslands]] in [[India]], the tallest grassland in the world, herds of [[Indian elephant]]s plow through tall grasses during seasonal changes which provide an open area for other large animals to roam. During spring, herds of endangered [[saiga antelope]] migrate across [[Eurasian Steppe]] in search of fresh grass. Two newly born twins are left hidden in the grass by their mother until they are able to stand up. During the rainy season, thunderstorms occur rapidly in grassland which became more sporadic for forests to thrive allowing the grasses to grow annually for rainfall. In [[Botswana]], the flooded rainwater from the storm transforms the grassland into the lush [[Okavango Delta]]. A pride of lions, however, find it more challenging to run down their prey in flooded areas of the delta as they attempt to hunt an [[African buffalo]]. A female [[Eurasian harvest mouse]] leaves her nest as she treks across the meadows foraging for food. She encounters a [[barn owl]] before escaping its grasp and returns home safely to her offspring. In the African [[savannah]], [[southern carmine bee-eater]]s struggle to catch insects hidden within grass while a [[kori bustard]] and [[common ostrich|ostrich]]es provide lack of support. While flying in front of a bull [[African bush elephant]], the bee-eaters gain a perfect opportunity to grab their prizes before the dry season begins. During the dry season, the grasslands begin to wither providing less food for the herbivores, while specialised predators find another opportunity. A [[serval]] uses her large ears to detect prey like [[Southern African vlei rat]]s. In the [[Serengeti]], herds consisting of millions of [[blue wildebeest]] migrate across the savanna in pursuit of rain along with [[Jackson's widowbird]]s, not only to seek food but to mate. A male widowbird tears off grasses to create an even surface and a centerpiece stage to attract females while facing competition with rivals. [[Leafcutter ant]] colonies in South America continuously harvest vast amounts of grasses to furnish their agriculture with fungi providing enough nutrients for them to feed. In northern [[Australia]], colonies of [[Amitermes meridionalis|compass termite]]s build multiple giant mounds that serve as a compass facing the north-south axis, which also protects them from flooding and extreme heat. On the plains of [[South America]], a [[giant anteater]] digs up a termite mound and consumes 2000 of them a day. As fire ravages the grassland, the grass stems survive underground and continue to recover before raining season. In the [[prairie]]s of North America during winter, [[American bison]] wrestle with starvation and endure frigid conditions as they shovel thick snow for buried grasses while a [[American red fox|red fox]] finds a [[vole]] hidden within the snow. In the [[Arctic]] [[tundra]] during spring, 500 miles from the prairies, female [[reindeer|caribou]] migrate to the north to give birth as the calves learn to sprint and gallop while joining their mothers and set off for the next feeding ground. As the herd ventures across the tundra, a pack of [[Arctic wolf|Arctic wolves]] ambush the herd and one of the wolves manages to separate a calf but the calf uses its stamina to outrun the wolf before rejoining the herd. As the caribous travel onward to find their feeding ground, the narrator speculates that the grassland provides a great gathering of wildlife on Earth.\n\nThe ''Planet Earth II Diaries'' review the teams' exploration in [[Kaziranga]] of [[North India]], using hidden camera traps to avoid their encounter with Indian elephants, [[water buffalo]]s, [[Bengal tiger]]s and [[Indian rhinoceros]] while filming them.\n |LineColor       = #000000\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 6\n |Title           = Cities\n |Aux1            = Fredi Devas\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2016|12|11|df=y}}\n |Viewers         = 11.10\n |ShortSummary    =\n\nThe last episode focuses on the urban environment as animals struggle to contend with their coexistence with humans. In [[Jodhpur]], a bachelor gang of [[gray langur]]s jump across the rooftops to compete with an alpha male as he successfully expels them from his territory. Aftermath, they settle on the sacred temple garden which serves as a feeding ground for them and peaceful coexistence with [[Hindus]] resulting in increased breeding. [[Peregrine falcon]]s settle on the highest perches in [[New York City]] as they soar across the street to hunt down [[pigeon]]s. At night, an [[Indian leopard]] prowls across the streets of [[Mumbai]] looking for prey as it hunts feral urban [[pig]]s. During the hot summer of [[Rome]], a flock of one million [[common starling]]s gather in the evening after feeding as they return to their roosting tree while performing aerobatic murmurations. While building a bower for glamour to impress a female, a male [[great bowerbird]] settles on the golf course of [[Townsville]] to collect man-made objects for support as it raids the rival's collection before being deceived. During springtime in [[Toronto]], a family of urban [[raccoon]]s settle in the chimney for warmth as they explore urban areas while searching for their new home, under their mother's supervision. A troop of [[rhesus macaque]]s settles in the crowded marketplace of [[Jaipur]], as they raid food from the market. At night, a clan of [[Spotted hyenas in Harar|spotted hyena]]s compete with each other for food as they venture into the walled city of [[Harar]]. As the clans wander across the city streets, the [[Harari people]] have established a traditional coexistence with the hyenas by feeding them with fresh meat and bones which took place since 400 years ago. Pigeons in [[Albi]] gather at the river to preen their feathers and are ambushed by a [[wels catfish]], a species that was introduced in the area since the 1970s. As cities began to expand, they also provide electricity resulting in light pollution that affect wildlife activities. On the coastline of [[Barbados]] at night, endangered [[hawksbill sea turtle]] hatchlings used their instinct to follow the moonlight before reaching the sea while others wander aimlessly into the city streets because of the confusion of city lights. Unlike other cities that decimated wildlife, there are other urban areas that cope with nature's coexistence. In [[Milan]], [[Italy]], residents present a solution to support nature by building urban forestation like the [[Bosco Verticale]] that contains more than 900 trees. In [[Singapore]], two million trees have been planted over 45 years in urban areas, including the Supertree Grove in [[Gardens by the Bay]], which are home to several exotic ferns and vines among other plants. It is also a suitable settlement for wildlife, such as [[smooth-coated otter]]s. The episode ends with [[David Attenborough]] standing at the top of [[The Shard]] in [[London]] discussing the future for all life on Earth.\n\nThe ''Planet Earth II Diaries'' shows the teams' work in Jaipur while filming rhesus macaques raiding marketplaces.\n\n |LineColor       = #000000\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = \u2013\n |Title           = A World of Wonder\n |Aux1            = Elizabeth White\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2017|01|01|df=y}}<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b087y9wf|title=BBC One \u2013 Planet Earth II, A World of Wonder|access-date=12 December 2016}}</ref>\n |Viewers         = 12.02\n |ShortSummary    = A compilation of the wildlife series presented by [[David Attenborough]].\n |LineColor       = #000000\n}}\n}}\n\n{{quotation|\"Now, over half of us live in an urban environment. My home, too, is here, in the city of London. Looking down on this great metropolis, the ingenuity with which we continue to reshape the surface of our planet is very striking.

Yet, it's on this connection that the future of both humanity and the natural world will depend.
