It was produced as the [[List of Doctor Who Christmas specials|''Doctor Who'' Christmas special]] for 2006, broadcast on 25 December, and aired between the [[Doctor Who (series 2)|second]] and [[Doctor Who (series 3)|third series]] of the relaunched show.\n\nIn the episode, set in London, the alien Racnoss Empress ([[Sarah Parish]]) and the human resources head [[List of Doctor Who henchmen#Lance Bennett|Lance]] ([[Don Gilet]]) attempt to use Lance's fianc\u00e9e, the secretary [[Donna Noble]] ([[Catherine Tate]]), as a \"key\" to awaken the Racnoss children hibernating at the centre of the Earth by gradually and secretly poisoning Donna with an alien particle the Racnoss use as an energy source.\n\n==Plot==\nThe [[Tenth Doctor]] is shocked when [[Donna Noble]], in a wedding dress, appears within the [[TARDIS]] while in flight. The Doctor returns Donna to her wedding. At the reception, the Doctor determines that Donna must have absorbed a great deal of dangerous huon particles that drew her to the TARDIS. The reception is attacked by robots dressed as [[Santa Claus]]. The Doctor uses his sonic screwdriver to manipulate the sound system to destroy the robotic Santas, and discovers something is controlling them remotely from space.\n\nLearning that Donna and her fianc\u00e9 [[List of Doctor Who henchmen#B|Lance Bennett]] work for a security firm secretly owned by the [[Torchwood Institute]], the Doctor asks Lance to take them there. Underneath the building, the Doctor finds a long tunnel under the [[Thames Barrier]], and a secret laboratory producing huon particles, along with a pit that leads to the centre of the Earth. Their presence brings forth the spider-like Empress of the Racnoss, a species that the Time Lords drove to the brink of extinction in the Dark Times, because they devoured whole worlds. The Empress, who had been hiding in hibernation at the edge of the universe, awoke and secretly used the Torchwood company to gain the equipment to make huon particles. Lance reveals he has been working for the Empress the whole time and purposely fed huon particles to Donna (by adding them to her coffee) to help free the Empress' children and resurrect the species. Donna and the Doctor escape, and the Empress decides to use Lance as a substitute, force-feeding him huon particles and then throwing him into the pit, where he is eaten by the Racnoss children.\n\nThe Doctor takes Donna to his TARDIS and travels back billions of years to discover that an inert Racnoss ship became the core of the Earth as the planet formed around it; the Empress is now trying to wake her children aboard that ship with the huon particles. The Doctor and Donna return to the present as other Racnoss start emerging from the pit. The Empress uses her ship to start firing on Earth. The Doctor attempts to offer a peaceful solution but the Empress refuses, and the Doctor is then forced to remotely detonate explosive baubles used by the Santas at the walls of the base, flooding the pit with water from the Thames and wiping out the Racnoss children. The Doctor is prepared to die, but Donna urges him to escape with her, just as the Empress teleports to her ship to try to escape. However, the ship's earlier attacking of London has weakened its defences, and the ship is destroyed by human forces under the direction of \"[[Harold Saxon|Mr. Saxon]]\". The Doctor offers Donna the opportunity to travel with him. She declines, but suggests he needs a companion to keep his temperament in check.\n\n[[File:280808-032 CPS (3997999369).jpg|thumb|right|The redesigned Robotic Santa Clauses, as shown at the Doctor Who Experience]]\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Doctor Who Experience (3176748368).jpg|thumb|left|Racnoss prop, as displayed at the Doctor Who Experience]]\nRussell T Davies had the idea for this episode from the very beginning of his association with the programme, and he planned to air it in Series Two. With the public announcement of two Christmas specials and the private knowledge of [[Billie Piper]] leaving at the end of Series Two, Davies decided to elevate this story to the Christmas special, not introducing the new companion immediately, and filling the slot with \"[[Tooth and Claw (Doctor Who)|Tooth and Claw]]\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/news/cult/news/drwho/2006/08/07/35509.shtml|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060813231831/http://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/news/cult/news/drwho/2006/08/07/35509.shtml|archive-date=13 August 2006|title=Wedding Plans: Russell reveals Runaway Bride origins in DWM special|publisher=BBC|date=2006-08-07|access-date=2011-12-04}}</ref>\n\nThe end of \"[[Doomsday (Doctor Who)|Doomsday]]\" is featured as part of the pre-title sequence, although the scene was actually refilmed. In his online podcast commentary for the episode, David Tennant explained that this was due to a change in lighting supervisors, and the one hired for this episode liked to light the TARDIS interior differently; the scene therefore had to be refilmed in order to match. The ''Doctor Who'' logo in the opening credits has been slightly redesigned from the previous one, with more background detail and flare on the \"lozenge\" that the words \"Doctor Who\" sit on.<ref name=\"new logo\">{{cite web |url=http://www.gallifreyone.com/forum/showpost.php?p=3358848&postcount=18|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071206141156/http://www.gallifreyone.com/forum/showpost.php?p=3358848&postcount=18 |archive-date=6 December 2007|title=New logo |work=Outpost Gallifrey (registration required) |date=2006-12-26 |access-date=2006-12-28}}</ref>\n\nFor legal reasons, the production team made obviously [[Prop#Money|fake banknotes]] for the scene where money comes flying out of a cashpoint.

As broadcast, after Donna finds a piece of Rose's clothing and challenges the Doctor about it, he angrily snatches it from her and sets a course for the TARDIS. As originally filmed, the Doctor first opens the TARDIS doors and throws the garment into space. Gardner said it was cut as it was too melodramatic a moment.<ref name=\"commentary\"/>\n\nThe TARDIS chase scene down the [[A4232 road|A4232 Grangetown Link Road]] was shown at a [[Children in Need]] concert,<ref name=\"Grangetown Link\">{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/southeast/sites/doctorwho/pages/runawaybride.shtml?7 |publisher= BBC |title=Doctor Who The Runaway Bride|access-date=2008-03-07}}</ref> which featured a live orchestra performing many of the music themes from Doctor Who, including the Dalek music and Rose's theme. The clip was leaked online shortly after the event and the concert and clip were shown earlier before the episode officially aired on Christmas Day on a ''[[Doctor Who Confidential]]'' special at 1:00&nbsp;p.m.\n\n===Cast notes===\nSarah Parish has co-starred with David Tennant in two other [[BBC One]] dramas: ''[[Blackpool (TV serial)|Blackpool]]'' (2004) and ''[[Recovery (TV drama)|Recovery]]'' (2007).

[[Jacqueline King]] and Howard Attfield are introduced in this episode, and were both due to return in  \"[[Partners In Crime (Doctor Who)|Partners In Crime]]\", the first episode of the 2008 season.
