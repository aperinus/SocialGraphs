P. Lovecraft's Re-Animator''''') is a 1985 American [[comedy horror]] film loosely based on the 1922 [[H. P. Lovecraft]] serial novelette \"[[Herbert West\u2013Reanimator]]\".<ref>Stephen Jones. ''The Essential Monster Movie Guide''. Billboard Books. 2000. Pg. 313</ref> Directed by [[Stuart Gordon]] and produced by [[Brian Yuzna]], the film stars [[Jeffrey Combs]] as [[Herbert West]], a medical student who has invented a reagent which can [[Undead|re-animate]] deceased bodies. He and his classmate Dan Cain ([[Bruce Abbott]]) begin to test the serum on dead human bodies, and conflict with Dr. Carl Hill ([[David Gale (actor)|David Gale]]), who is infatuated with Cain's fianc\u00e9e ([[Barbara Crampton]]) and wants to claim the invention as his own.\n\nOriginally devised by Gordon as a theatrical stage production and later a half-hour television pilot, the television script was revised to become a feature film. Filmed in [[Hollywood, Los Angeles|Hollywood]], the film originally was released without a rating from the [[Motion Picture Association of America]], and was later edited to obtain an [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system|R rating]]. It garnered its largest audience through the unrated cut's release on home video.\n\n''Re-Animator'' is the first film collaboration between Gordon and Combs, the second being ''[[From Beyond (film)|From Beyond]]'', released in 1986. It is the first film in the [[Re-Animator (film series)|''Re-Animator'' film series]], followed by ''[[Bride of Re-Animator]]'' in 1990 and ''[[Beyond Re-Animator]]'' in 2003. Released to mostly positive reviews, ''Re-Animator'' has since been considered a [[cult film]].\n\n==Plot==\nAt the [[University of Zurich]] Institute of Medicine in Switzerland, [[Herbert West]] brings his dead professor, Dr. Hans Gruber, back to life. There are horrific side-effects, however; as West explains, the dosage was too large. When accused of killing Gruber, West counters: \"I gave him life!\"\n\nWest arrives at [[Miskatonic University]] in [[Arkham|Arkham, Massachusetts]] in order to further his studies as a medical student. He rents a room from fellow medical student Dan Cain and converts the house's basement into his own personal laboratory. West demonstrates his reanimating reagent to Dan by reanimating Dan's dead cat Rufus.  The cat behaves viciously that night forcing Dan to kill it again before West reanimates what is left of it. Dan's fianc\u00e9e Megan Halsey, daughter of the medical school's dean, walks in on this experiment and is horrified.\n\nDan tries to tell the dean about West's success in reanimating the dead cat, but the dean does not believe him. When Dan insists, the dean implies that Dan and West have gone mad. Barred from the school, West and Dan sneak into the morgue to test the reagent on a human subject in an attempt to prove that the reagent works, and thereby salvage their medical careers. The corpse they inject comes back to life, but in a frenetic and violent [[zombie]]-like state. Dr. Halsey stumbles upon the scene and is killed by the reanimated corpse, which West then kills with a bone-saw. Excited at the prospect of working with a freshly dead specimen, West injects Dr. Halsey's body with his reanimating reagent. Dr. Halsey returns to life, also in a zombie-like state. Megan chances upon the scene, and is hysterical. Dan collapses in shock.\n\nDr. Halsey's colleague Dr. Carl Hill, a professor and researcher at the hospital, takes charge of Dr. Halsey, whom he puts in a padded observation cell adjacent to his office. He carries out a surgical operation on him, lobotomizing him. During the course of this operation, he discovers that Dr. Halsey is not sick, but dead and reanimated.\n\nDr. Hill goes to West's basement lab and attempts to blackmail him into surrendering his reagent and notes, hoping to take credit for West's discovery. West offers to demonstrate the reagent and puts a few drops of it onto a microscope slide with dead cat tissue. As Dr. Hill peers through the microscope at this slide, West clobbers him from behind with a shovel, and then decapitates him with it. West then reanimates Dr. Hill's head and body separately. While West is questioning Dr. Hill's head and taking notes, Dr. Hill's body sneaks up behind him and knocks him unconscious. The body carries the head back to Dr. Hill's office, with West's reagent and notes.\n\nIn his re-animated state, Dr. Hill acquires the ability to control other re-animated corpses telepathically, after conducting brain surgery on them. He then directs Dr. Halsey to snatch Megan away from Dan. While being carried to the morgue by her reanimated father, Megan faints. When she arrives, Dr. Hill strips her naked and straps her unconscious body to a table. She regains consciousness as Hill's body and bloody, severed head begin to sexually assault her.\n\nHill's body starts to place his head between Megan's legs, but is interrupted by the arrival of West and Dan. West distracts Dr. Hill while Dan frees Megan. Dr. Hill reveals that he has reanimated and lobotomized several corpses from the morgue, rendering them susceptible to mind control as Halsey is. However, Megan's voice reawakens a protectiveness in her father, who fights off the other corpses as Dan and Megan escape. In the ensuing chaos, West injects Dr. Hill's body with a lethal overdose of the reagent. Dr. Hill's body mutates rapidly and attacks West, who screams out to Dan to save his work before being pulled away by Dr. Hill's monstrous entrails.\n\nDan retrieves the satchel containing West's reagent and notes. As Dan and Megan flee the morgue, one of the reanimated corpses attacks and strangles Megan. Dan takes her to the hospital emergency room and tries to revive her, but she is dead. In despair, he injects her with West's reagent. After the scene fades to black, Megan, apparently revived, can be heard screaming.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Jeffrey Combs]] as [[Herbert West]]\n* [[Bruce Abbott]] as Daniel Cain\n* [[Barbara Crampton]] as Megan Halsey\n* [[David Gale (actor)|David Gale]] as Dr. Carl Hill\n* [[Robert Sampson (actor)|Robert Sampson]] as Dean Alan Halsey\n* Al Berry as Dr. Hans Gruber\n* Carolyn Purdy-Gordon as Dr. Harrod\n* Ian Patrick Williams as the Swiss Professor\n* Gerry Black as Mace\n* Peter Kent as Melvin the Re-Animated\n* Craig Reed as the One Arm Man Corpse a.k.a. the Burn Victim\n\n==Production==\nThe idea to make ''Re-Animator'' came from a discussion [[Stuart Gordon]] had with friends one night about [[vampire]] films.<ref name= \"Brody\">{{cite news | last = Brody | first = Meredith | title = We Killed 'Em in Chicago | work = [[Film Comment]] | pages = 70 | date = February 1987 }}</ref> He felt that there were too many [[Dracula]] films and expressed a desire to see a [[Frankenstein]] film. Someone asked if he had read \"[[Herbert West\u2013Reanimator]]\" by [[H. P. Lovecraft]]. Gordon had read most of the author's works, but not that story, which was long out of print. He went to the [[Chicago Public Library]] and read their copy.<ref name= \"Brody\"/><ref name=Hallcom>{{cite book |title=Comedy-Horror Films: A Chronological History, 1914-2008 |url=https://archive.org/details/comedyhorrorfilm00hall|url-access=limited |last=Hallenbeck |first=Bruce G.|publisher=[[McFarland & Company]]|year=2009 |isbn=9780786453788|pages=142\u2013145}}</ref>\n\nOriginally, Gordon was going to adapt Lovecraft's story for the stage, but eventually decided along with writers [[Dennis Paoli]] and William Norris to make it as a half-hour television pilot.<ref name= \"Brody\"/> The story was set around the turn of the century, and they soon realized that it would be too expensive to recreate. They updated it to the present day in [[Chicago]] with the intention of using actors from the Organic Theater company. They were told that the half hour format was not saleable and so they made it an hour, writing 13 episodes.<ref name= \"Brody\"/> Special effects technician Bob Greenberg, who had worked on [[John Carpenter]]'s ''[[Dark Star (film)|Dark Star]]'', repeatedly told Gordon that the only market for horror was in feature films, and introduced him to producer [[Brian Yuzna]]. Gordon showed Yuzna the script for the pilot and the 12 additional episodes. The producer liked what he read and convinced Gordon to shoot the film in [[Hollywood, Los Angeles|Hollywood]], because of all the special effects involved. Yuzna made a distribution deal with [[Charles Band]]'s [[Empire Pictures]] in return for post-production services.<ref name= \"Brody\"/><ref name=GallaDire>{{cite book |last=Gallagher |first=John Andrew |chapter=Stuart Gordon |title=Film Directors on Directing |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group |year=1989 |pages=92\u201393 |isbn=9780275932725 |chapter-url-access=registration |chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/filmdirectorsond00gall/page/92}}</ref> However, after viewing the initial [[dailies]] Empire became involved in the actual production, making a number of suggestions, including the recruitment of [[Mac Ahlberg]] as cinematographer.<ref name=GallaDire/>\n\nAccording to Paoli, the first draft of the script contained no humor whatsoever, and the film's comedic elements only came out over further revisions and during the actual production.<ref name=Hallcom/>\n\nYuzna described the film as having the \"sort of shock sensibility of an ''[[The Evil Dead|Evil Dead]]'' with the production values of, hopefully, ''[[The Howling (film)|The Howling]]''.\"<ref name= \"Fischer\">{{cite news | last = Fischer | first = Dennis | title = A Moist Zombie Movie | work = [[Fangoria]] | pages = 44 | date = August 1985 }}</ref> Gordon cited ''[[The Revenge of Frankenstein]]'' as a major inspiration for the film.<ref name=Hallcom/> John Naulin worked on the film's gruesome makeup effects, using what he described as \"disgusting shots brought out from the [[Cook County]] morgue of all kinds of different [[Livor mortis|lividities]] and different corpses.\"<ref name=\"Fischer2\">Fischer 1985, p. 45.</ref> The morgue set was based on the aforementioned Cook County morgue, which was newly built and featured cutting edge technology; Gordon opted for this look since he felt old morgues had been overdone in horror films.<ref name=GallaDire/> Naulin and Gordon also used a book of [[forensic pathology]] in order to present how a corpse looks once the blood settles in the body, creating a variety of odd skin tones. Naulin said that ''Re-Animator'' was the bloodiest film he had ever worked on: in the past, he had never used more than a couple of gallons (7.6{{tsp}}liters) of blood on a film, but on ''Re-Animator'' he used twelve times as much.<ref name= \"Fischer2\"/>\n\n[[Jeffrey Combs]] was cast as Herbert West. Combs had never read any H. P. Lovecraft before his casting and was taken aback by the script; he later said he only took the role because he needed the work and assumed the film would never reach a large audience.<ref name=Hallcom/>\n\n[[Principal photography]] began on November 28, 1984, with a six-week shooting schedule,<ref name=\"AFI\"/> though Gordon has boasted that they finished shooting the film in just four weeks.<ref name=GallaDire/> The biggest makeup challenge in the film was the headless Dr. Hill zombie.<ref name= \"Fischer2\"/> Tony Doublin designed the mechanical effects and was faced with the problem of proportion once the 9&ndash;10&nbsp;inches of the head were removed from the body. Each scene forced him to use a different technique. For example, one technique involved building an upper torso that actor [[David Gale (actor)|David Gale]] could bend over and stick his head through so that it appeared to be the one that the walking corpse was carrying around.<ref name= \"Fischer2\"/>\n\nThe \"reanimating agent\" was simply [[luminol]].<ref name=GallaDire/>\n\n==Soundtrack==\nThe score for the film was composed by [[Richard Band]], and has been noted for its similarities to [[Bernard Herrmann]]'s score for [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s 1960 film ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://comingsoon.net/horror/news/748928-interview-composer-richard-band-music-re-animator|title=Interview: Composer Richard Band on the Music of RE-ANIMATOR|location=[[CraveOnline|ComingSoon.net]]|author=Chris Alexander|date=18 March 2016|access-date=10 December 2016}}</ref> The score took about three and a half weeks to complete, and was recorded in Italy with the [[Accademia Filarmonica Romana|Rome Philharmonic]].<ref name=larson>{{cite web|url=https://cnmsarchive.wordpress.com/2015/08/03/richard-band-on-scoring-re-animator/|title=Richard Band on Scoring Re-Animator|publisher=Soundtrack|author=Randall D.

However, this presented advertising restrictions, since many media outlets had policies against promoting unrated films.<ref name=AFI/> In early 1986, the filmmakers submitted a re-edited version of ''Re-Animator'' to the MPAA, which received an R rating.<ref name=AFI/> In the USA, the vast majority of home media releases of the film used the unrated version.<ref name=Hallcom/><ref name=cens/>\n\nThe R-rated version runs 93 minutes and has much of the gore edited out and replaced with various scenes which had been deleted for pacing purposes, including a subplot involving Dr. Hill hypnotizing several of the characters to make them more suggestible to his will (in this version, Dean Halsey is hypnotized early on to turn him against West, and then later is hypnotized again after he has been re-animated; in the theatrical film, the re-animated Halsey's submission is merely a result of the lobotomy). In addition, a short scene was added showing Herbert West injecting himself with small amounts of the reagent to stay awake and energized; this may have affected his thinking over the course of the film.<ref>{{cite AV media|title=Re-Animator|date=October 18, 1985|medium=Film|publisher=[[Empire International Pictures]]|trans-title=R-Rated Cut|people=[[Stuart Gordon]] (Director)}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dreadcentral.com/reviews/246321/re-animator-blu-ray-2/|title=Re-Animator (Blu-ray)|publisher=[[Dread Central]]|first=Anthony|last=Arrigo|date=August 10, 2017|access-date=November 11, 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe unrated version is often labeled as a \"[[director's cut]]\", which strictly speaking is false; director Stuart Gordon was not allowed to determine the final cut on any version of the film.

Fans thought the film a desecration of Lovecraft; their literary hero would never write such obvious exploitation! But the final criticism of the film might have been a bit more muted if these fans had actually read the 'West' stories, which are pure exploitation.
