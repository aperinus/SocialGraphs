The film was directed by [[Jonathan Lynn]]. In addition to Murphy, the film stars [[Lane Smith]], [[Sheryl Lee Ralph]], [[Joe Don Baker]], [[James Garner]], [[Victoria Rowell]], [[Grant Shaud]], [[Kevin McCarthy (actor)|Kevin McCarthy]], [[Charles S. Dutton]], Victor Rivers, [[Chi McBride]], Sonny Jim Gaines, and [[Noble Willingham]].\n\nThe film's plot is centered on politics, specifically what members of Congress and lobbyists do to get what they want in Washington, D.C. This is the first film of [[Eddie Murphy]] not to be distributed by [[Paramount Pictures]].\n\n==Plot==\nA Florida [[con man]] named Thomas Jefferson Johnson ([[Eddie Murphy]]) schemes to use the passing of the longtime Congressman from his district, Jefferson Davis \"Jeff\" Johnson ([[James Garner]]) (who died of a heart attack while having sex with his secretary), to get elected to the [[United States Congress]] as a freshman Congressman, where the money flows from [[Lobbying|lobbyists]]. Omitting his first name, and abbreviating his middle name, he calls himself \"Jeff\" Johnson.  He then manages to get on the ballot by pitching a seniors organization, the Silver Foxes, to endorse him.\n\nOnce on the election ballot, he uses the dead Congressman's old campaign material and runs a low budget campaign that appeals to [[name recognition]], figuring most people do not pay much attention and simply vote for the \"name you know.\"  He wins a slim victory and is off to Washington, a place where the \"streets are lined with gold.\"\n\nInitially, the lucrative donations and campaign contributions roll in, but as he learns the nature of the con game in Washington D.C., he starts to see how the greed and corruption makes it difficult to address issues such as [[Campaign finance reform in the United States|campaign finance reform]], [[environmental protection]], and the possibility that [[Electromagnetic field#Health and safety|electromagnetic fields]] from [[overhead power line]]s may be giving kids in a small town [[cancer]], which the electric power company is concealing.\n\nIn trying to address these issues, Congressman Johnson finds himself double-crossed by the powerful chairman of the [[United States House Committee on Energy and Commerce|Committee on Power and Industry]], Rep. Dick Dodge ([[Lane Smith]]). Johnson decides to fight back the only way he knows how: with a con. Johnson succeeds and exposes Dodge as corrupt. As the film ends, it appears likely that Johnson will be thrown out of Congress on account of his previously unknown criminal record, but he defiantly declares, \"I'm gonna run for [[U.S. President|President]]!\" then [[breaking the fourth wall]].\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Eddie Murphy]] as Thomas Jefferson Johnson\n*[[Lane Smith]] as Dick Dodge\n*[[Sheryl Lee Ralph]] as Loretta Hicks\n*[[Joe Don Baker]] as Olaf Andersen\n*[[James Garner]] as Jeff Johnson\n*[[Victoria Rowell]] as Celia Kirby\n*[[Grant Shaud]] as Arthur Reinhardt\n*[[Kevin McCarthy (actor)|Kevin McCarthy]] as Terry Corrigan\n*[[Charles S.
