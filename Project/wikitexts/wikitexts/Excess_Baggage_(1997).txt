Adams]], [[Dick Clement]], and [[Ian La Frenais]], and directed by [[Marco Brambilla]] about a neglected young woman who stages her own kidnapping to get her father's attention, only to be actually kidnapped by a car thief. The film stars [[Alicia Silverstone]] (who was also an uncredited producer), [[Benicio del Toro]], and [[Christopher Walken]].\n\n==Plot==\n{{more plot|date=November 2015}}\nEmily Hope ([[Alicia Silverstone]]) stages her own [[kidnapping]] to get the attention of her wealthy, corrupt father. She puts herself in the trunk of her [[BMW 850]]i with taped legs and mouth, and handcuffs. After calling the police to come \"rescue\" her, a car thief named Vincent Roche ([[Benicio del Toro]]) unknowingly steals the car with her in it. [[Christopher Walken]] shows up as Emily's Uncle Ray, [[Jack Thompson (actor)|Jack Thompson]] as Emily's father and [[Harry Connick, Jr.]], as Greg, Vincent's car-stealing partner.\n\n==Background==\nThe script for ''Excess Baggage'' was the winner of the first annual Austin Film Festival Screenplay Competition where it was picked up by Barry Josephson when he was at Sony.<ref name=background>{{Cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/austin-film-festival-spotlight-screenwriters-151217|title=Austin Film Festival spotlight screenwriters|website=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=28 September 2007}}</ref>\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Alicia Silverstone]] as Emily Hope, a rich girl with a black belt in karate and a tendency for trouble. She had burned down her school library, perhaps to get the attention of her father when she was younger. Her relationship with her father is quite cold, but she has a solid friendship with her Uncle Ray and builds one with Vincent after he accidentally abducts her.\n* [[Benicio del Toro]] as Vincent Roche, a successful and experienced car thief who supports himself with his work. He is referred to as \"an innocent thief\" who happens to steal the car with Emily in the trunk. After this his entire life is turned upside down as he gets implicated in several schemes and becomes dependent on his \"hostage\" to survive.\n* [[Christopher Walken]] as Raymond \"Uncle Ray\" Perkins, Emily's uncle and cares for her well-being much more than her own father. He also suspects that this kidnapping situation is not a real kidnapping and might be one of Emily's \"games\" to get some much craved attention from her dad. His first encounters with Vincent are rather hostile, but the two eventually form a camaraderie.\n* [[Jack Thompson (actor)|Jack Thompson]] as Alexander T. Hope, Emily's father and a very rich and successful businessman. He also pays little to no attention to his daughter, which often leads to her performing such outrageous stunts to get it as burning down her school library or staging her own kidnapping; these tend to backfire as the more effort she invests in trying to get him to pay attention to her, the less he sees fit to pay to her. It is hinted that his business deals may be corrupt.\n* [[Harry Connick Jr.]] as Greg Kistler, Vincent's partner-in-crime, but it appears that Vincent does most of the work. They steal cars and sell them to people like Gus and Stick, which eventually lands them into trouble when their operation is burned down and Vincent is on the lam.\n* [[Nicholas Turturro]] and [[Michael Bowen (actor)|Michael Bowen]] as Stick and Gus, two hoodlums who have had business transactions with Vincent and Greg but eventually turn on them.\n* [[Leland Orser]] and Robert Wisden as Detectives Bernaby and Sims, two detectives who are investigating Emily's \"kidnapping\".\n* [[Sally Kirkland]] as Louise Doucette, a bartender/waitress at a cafe near Vincent's home. Ray gets information about Vincent from her during his investigation of the kidnapping. She only appears in two scenes.\n\nThe film features [[cameo appearance]]s by voice actor [[David Kaye (voice actor)|David Kaye]] and [[April Telek]] both of whom are uncredited.\n\n==Production==\nThis was the first film produced by [[Alicia Silverstone]] under her production company First Kiss and was filmed in Vancouver and Victoria, British Columbia. Silverstone was nominated for a [[Razzie Award for Worst Actress]] where she lost to [[Demi Moore]] for ''[[G.I. Jane]]''.<ref name=autogenerated2>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119086/awards Excess Baggage awards list]</ref>\n\n===Casting===\n[[Benicio del Toro]] was hand-picked for the role by producer Silverstone after she had seen ''[[The Usual Suspects]]'' (1995). It is also reported that Silverstone and del Toro dated around the time of filming.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywood.com/celebrity/Alicia_Silverstone/189243 |title=AliciaSilverstone at |publisher=Hollywood.com |access-date=2010-10-09}}</ref> Del Toro was nominated for an [[ALMA Award]] for Outstanding Individual Performance in a Crossover Role in a Feature Film.<ref name=autogenerated2 />\n\n[[Christopher Walken]] previously worked with del Toro in two other 1996 films, ''[[Basquiat (film)|Basquiat]]'' and ''[[The Funeral (1996 film)|The Funeral]]''. He would later star in ''[[Blast from the Past (film)|Blast from the Past]]'' (1999) with Silverstone two years later. \"I don't know why everybody thinks he's so crazy,\" Silverstone noted. \"I think he seems so adorable.
