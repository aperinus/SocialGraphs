The film stars [[Tom Hardy]] as Michael Peterson, known from 1987 as [[Charles Bronson (prisoner)|Charles Bronson]]. The film follows the life of this prisoner, considered Britain's most violent criminal, who has been responsible for a dozen or so cases of hostage taking while incarcerated.<ref name=\"Maher\">{{cite news|last=Maher|first=Kevin|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/charles-bronson-i-am-being-slowly-dehumanised-kept-in-a-concrete-coffin-6tbq702b5q7|title=Charles Bronson: I am being slowly dehumanised, kept in a concrete coffin|work=The Times|date=18 March 2009|access-date=6 June 2019}} {{subscription required}}</ref> He was given the name Charles Bronson by his fight promoter, for his bare-knuckle fighting years.\n\nBorn into a respectable middle-class family, Peterson became known as one of the United Kingdom's most dangerous prisoners. Because of his violence, Bronson was repeatedly put into isolation or [[solitary confinement]], which may have contributed to his emotional problems.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 to 700 words. -->\nThe film begins with scenes from Peterson's delinquent early life which he narrates with self-deprecating humor. Initially he addresses the camera dressed in prison garb; other times, he tells his tale in a [[vaudeville|vaudeville-style]] theatre with a live audience. The film's story unfolds as a [[Surrealism|surreal]] narrative of connected vignettes punctuated by vaudeville interludes.\n\nHe recounts episodes of crime and violence leading to his first prison sentence of seven years. At sentencing, his mother hopes he will be out in four but his violence in prison extends his sentence beyond seven years. He is sent to a [[psychiatric hospital]], where he continues to rebel and is administered drugs which he claims make him physically weak. His first escape attempt is to walk sluggishly toward the exit, where he is waved back to a chair by a staffer. He decides to escape by earning a transfer back to prison and attempts to strangle a detainee that revealed himself to be a [[pedophile]], but is apprehended before killing the man. He comments to the audience that despite all his prison time and [[solitary confinement]], he has never killed anyone.\n\nIn the vaudeville theatre, he shows film footage of a rooftop protest during which he claims to have caused \"tens of millions of pounds' damage\". He credits this destruction with the government's decision to declare him \"sane\" and have him released. After a brief reunion with his parents, he sets off to see his flamboyant Uncle Jack. He is welcomed and reintroduced to an old prison mate who promises to set him up as a [[bare-knuckle boxer]], and gives him the name Charles Bronson, after [[Charles Bronson|the American actor]].\n\nBronson enjoys the violence and showmanship of bare-knuckle boxing. Not content with his meagre winnings, he ups the stakes by fighting two opponents at once and even fights a dog. He proposes to a woman and steals a thousand-pound ring in the hope that she will marry him. She declines; after sixty-nine days of freedom, Bronson is sent back to jail.\n\nHe takes the prison librarian hostage and waits for reinforcements to arrive, alternately screaming at his hostage and peaceably enquiring after his family. When other guards arrive, he strips naked and forces the librarian to assist in applying his \"body armor\" of [[petroleum jelly]], to make him harder to grab in the imminent brawl. After being restrained, he is warned by the prison governor that he will die inside if his behavior does not improve. Encouraged by a prison art teacher, who notices something special in his drawings, he becomes a model prisoner for a while, channeling his confusion and pain into vivid imagery of birds and grotesque creatures. When told that the art studio will be closing, Bronson attacks the teacher and holds him hostage.\n\nWhile prison officials wait outside, he demands music be played. He paints his naked body black and ties the teacher to a post. He paints a moustache onto the teacher's face, forces an apple into his mouth and removes his hat and glasses to put on the teacher's head. After this human [[still-life]] has been arranged to his satisfaction, he accepts his fate, calling for the prison guards to burst in for yet another brawl, for which he will be sent back to solitary confinement.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Tom Hardy]] as [[Charles Bronson (prisoner)|Michael Gordon Peterson / Charles Bronson]]\n* [[Matt King (comedian)|Matt King]] as Paul Daniels, nightclub owner and former fellow prisoner\n* [[James Lance]] as Phil Danielson, prison art teacher\n* [[Amanda Burton]] as Charlie's mother\n* [[Kelly Adams]] as Irene Peterson, Charlie's wife\n* Juliet Oldfield as Alison, Charlie's lover\n* [[Jonathan Phillips (actor)|Jonathan Phillips]] as the Prison Governor\n* [[Mark Powley]] as Prison Officer Andy Love\n*  [[Hugh Ross (actor)|Hugh Ross]] as Uncle Jack\n* Luing Andrews as Prison Officer\n* Joe Tucker as John White, fellow patient in Rampton\n* Gordon Brown as Screw, the first guard Bronson fights\n* Charlie Whyman as fellow patient in Rampton\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Tom Hardy & Nicolas Winding Refn.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Hardy and director Nicolas Winding Refn promoting ''Bronson'' in 2009]]\nFor the role, Hardy had telephone conversations with Charles Bronson, before meeting him.

Can you imagine how you'd cringe if the film ended in a flashback of little Mickey undergoing childhood trauma? There is some human behavior beyond our ability to comprehend. I was reading a theory the other day that a few people just happen to be pure evil. I'm afraid I believe it. They lack any conscience, any sense of pity or empathy for their victims.

According to Refn's DVD [[audio commentary]], his mother said she loved it. On 15 November 2011, he was granted permission to view it. Describing it as \"theatrical, creative, and brilliant\", Bronson heaped praise upon Hardy, but disagreed on the implied distance between himself and his father; and the portrayal of Paul Edmunds, a former prisoner and nightclub owner (portrayed in the film by [[Matt King (comedian)|Matt King]] as Paul Daniels) as \"a bit of a ponce\". Bronson challenged his own family's reaction to the portrayal of his Uncle Jack, stating that he \"loved\" it, as would Jack himself. Bronson's trust in Hardy's acting grew such that once he had seen the film, he said, \"If I were to die in jail then at least I live on through Britain's No 1 actor\".<ref>{{cite web|last=Bronson | first=Charlie|date=16 November 2011|url=http://thecharliebronsonappealfund.co.uk/charlies-reaction-to-bronson/4557668873 |title=Charlie's reaction to 'Bronson'|publisher=The Charlie Bronson Appeal Fund |access-date=26 January 2019 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130421103935/http://thecharliebronsonappealfund.co.uk/charlies-reaction-to-bronson/4557668873 |archive-date=21 April 2013 }}</ref> Bronson had been originally displeased with the choice of Hardy as star, but during their first meeting in person, Hardy assured him that he would \"fix it\".<ref>[http://uk.askmen.com/entertainment/special_feature_250/267_tom-hardy-becoming-charles-bronson.html \"Tom Hardy: Becoming Bronson\"].
