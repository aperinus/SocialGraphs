Considered the conclusion to Cooper's \"Harlem Trilogy\" (the preceding films being ''[[New Jack City]]'' (1991) and ''[[Sugar Hill (1994 film)|Sugar Hill]]'' (1994)), the film tells the story about a promising [[New York City]] high school basketball star and his relationships with a [[drug dealer]] and a former basketball star, now employed as a security guard at the high school he was a promising young star at years ago.\n\nThe film mostly took place in [[Harlem]], with various scenes filmed at the [[Manhattan Center for Science and Mathematics]] in [[East Harlem]]. Some of the basketball scenes were filmed at [[Samuel J. Tilden High School]] in Brooklyn, New York.\n\n==Plot==\nKyle-Lee Watson is a talented [[basketball]] player who is about to graduate from [[high school]]. While he waits to find out if he will receive a scholarship to [[Georgetown University]], he finds himself in a difficult dilemma over a playground basketball [[tournament]]. He must decide whether to play for and follow his widely beloved basketball [[Coach (sport)|coach]] Mike Rollins and Birdie, a local drug dealer in the neighborhood. Thomas \"Shep\" Sheppard, a former standout player himself, now works as a high school security guard. Kyle feels resentment towards the security guard, because Kyle's own mother is falling in love with Shep.\n\nCoincidentally, Kyle's coach also wants Shep to coach his team when he feels it is time for him to retire. It is later revealed to Kyle that Shep is Birdie's older brother. Kyle makes a decision to run with Birdie's team until he decided to come back to his old team, because of Birdie's wrongful actions against Flip and Kyle's friend Bugaloo. In the tournament, both Kyle's and Birdie's teams march to the finals, with Kyle's team playing solid team basketball, while Birdie's team plays a very rough & dirty style.\n\nBefore the finals, Birdie threatens Kyle, demanding Kyle to throw away the game, so that Birdie's team would win. Kyle is brutalized throughout the game, with Birdie's team having a solid lead. Shep, unable to watch any longer, joins Kyle's team. Despite being aggressively attacked throughout, Shep helps the team come back. In the final seconds, he passes the ball to Kyle, who dunks the ball and Kyle's team wins the game.\n\nAfter the loss, Birdie orders Motaw, his star player and gang member, to kill Kyle. Shep protects Kyle by jumping on him and Motaw shoots Shep. A security guard then fatally shoots Motaw twice. At a club, Bugaloo walks near Birdie and shoots Birdie, killing him, as revenge for previous humiliations. In the end, Kyle is revealed to have gotten the scholarship to [[Georgetown University]]. During a televised game, Kyle hits the game winner, while a recovered Shep watches with a smile.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Duane Martin]] as Kyle-Lee Watson, a talented basketball player who is determined to be accepted to Georgetown University, to play for their basketball team, the Hoyas. He is seen as cocky and hot tempered but later changes his ways during the course of the film. He is loosely based on [[Allen Iverson]], who also went to Georgetown.\n* [[Leon Robinson|Leon]] as Thomas \"Shep\" Sheppard, a quiet, bitter, introvert who used to be an incredible high school basketball player. He was later arrested after his best friend, Nutso, accidentally jumps off a high rise building while playing basketball.\n* [[Tupac Shakur]] as Birdie, a local thug and Shep's younger brother.\n* [[Bernie Mac]] as Flip, a homeless crackhead who played basketball in high school with Shep and Nutso.

She develops a relationship with Shep.\n* [[Marlon Wayans]] as Bugaloo, Kyle's womanizing yet goofy best friend who spent a year in juvenile detention for an unknown crime. He is often bullied by Birdie and his gang members.\n* [[David Bailey (actor)|David Bailey]] as Mike Rollins, a respected coach for Kyle's team, who tries to get Shep to play basketball again.\n* [[Wood Harris]] as Motaw, Birdie's teenaged lieutenant and star player on his team.
