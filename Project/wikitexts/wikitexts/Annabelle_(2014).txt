A prequel, titled ''[[Annabelle: Creation]]'', was released on August 11, 2017. A sequel, titled ''[[Annabelle Comes Home]]'', was released on June 26, 2019.\n\n==Plot==\nIn [[Santa Monica, California]], John Form, a doctor, presents his expectant wife Mia with a rare vintage [[porcelain]] doll as a gift for their first child to be placed in a collection of dolls in their daughter's nursery.\n\nThat night, the couple is disturbed by the sounds of their next door neighbors, the Higgins, being murdered during a home invasion. While Mia calls the police, she and John are attacked by the Higgins' killers. The police arrive and shoot one killer, a man, dead while the female killer kills herself by slitting her throat inside the nursery while holding the doll. News reports identify the assailants as the Higgins' estranged daughter, Annabelle, and her unidentified boyfriend, both members of a cult.\n\nIn the days following the attack, a series of paranormal activities occur around the Forms' residence. Afterwards, Mia gives birth to a healthy baby girl. She and John name their child Leah. The family rents an apartment in [[Pasadena, California|Pasadena]] and, after finding the doll that John had discarded since Annabelle's previous attack in one of their boxes, another set of paranormal events plague Mia and her daughter. \n\nMia calls back Detective Clarkin to gather information about Annabelle and the cultists and learns that the cult intends to [[Evocation|summon a demonic spirit]]. With the help of bookseller and fellow tenant Evelyn, Mia realizes that the cult practiced [[Theistic Satanism|devil worship]], which summoned a [[demon]] who followed the family after they moved to their apartment so as to claim a soul. Upon returning home, Mia and Leah are attacked by the demon who reveals itself while manipulating the doll. Mia and John contact their parish priest, Father Perez, who informs them that demons sometimes attach themselves to inanimate objects as an advantage to accomplish their goals and that a human soul must be offered for a purpose. Without any hopes of exorcising the demon out of the doll, Father Perez decides to take it away to seek help from [[Ed and Lorraine Warren|the Warrens]] for investigation. But before he can enter the church, the demon impersonating Annabelle's spirit attacks him and grabs the doll.\n\nFather Perez is hospitalized the next day and, when John checks on him, the priest warns him  that after sensing its powerful presence, the demon's true intention is to claim Mia's soul. That night, while Evelyn is visiting Mia, the demon uses Father Perez's physical form to sneak into the apartment and abduct Leah for her mother's soul. To spare her daughter, Mia attempts to jump out of the window with the doll but John arrives in time along with Evelyn to stop her. Evelyn decides to take her life in Mia's place instead as atonement for causing a car accident that resulted in the death of her daughter Ruby years ago. As Evelyn lies dead on the road, the demon and the doll disappear. Mia and John never saw or heard of the doll again and Leah is safely inside her crib.\n\nSix months later, the doll is bought from an antique shop by a mother as a gift for her daughter Debbie, a nursing student, and is seen stored and locked away into a glass case in the Warren's artifact room.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Annabelle Wallis]] as Mia Form\n* [[Ward Horton]] as John Form\n* [[Alfre Woodard]] as Evelyn\n* [[Tony Amendola]] as Father Perez\n* Kerry O'Malley as Sharon Higgins<ref name=\"Sharon\">{{cite web |title=Annabelle |url=https://dreadcentral.com/news/85087/85087/ |access-date=October 31, 2014 |work=Film Music Reporter |date=September 17, 2014}}</ref>\n* [[Brian Howe (actor)|Brian Howe]] as Pete Higgins\n* [[Eric Ladin]] as Detective Clarkin\n* [[Ivar Brogger]] as Dr. Burgher\n* [[Gabriel Bateman]] as Robert\n* Shiloh Nelson as Nancy\n* Geoff Wehner as Neighbor\n* Tree O'Toole as Annabelle \"Janice\" Higgins\n** Keira Daniels as 7-year-old Annabelle Higgins \n* [[Robin Pearson Rose]] as the Mother\n* Camden Singer as Clerk\n* Morganna May as Debbie\n* [[Amy Tipton]] as Camilla\n* Zach Pappas as Rick\n* Sasha Sheldon as Nurse\n* Christopher Shaw as Fuller\n* [[Joseph Bishara]] as Demon\n}}\n\n==Production==\n\n===Development===\nThe film is a spin-off of the 2013 horror film ''[[The Conjuring]]'', focusing on the origins of the Annabelle doll found in that film.<ref>{{Cite web |last=staff |first=Lexy Perez,THR |last2=Perez |first2=Lexy |last3=staff |first3=T.
