Nardo goes after her to get her back, but on his way he is carjacked and left naked. He calls Jason for help. Jason puts Evan in the car while he is asleep and heads towards Mexico. They stop in California to get a fake ID because Jason has lost his.\n\nNardo arrives at a town in Mexico and calls again, he is next to a wire service company and Evan offers to send him money through it. They go to a casino to meet a friend who can help them transfer the money. Evan hits on a girl in the casino, but she drugs him and takes him to a room to steal his kidney. Jason finds Evan and eventually rescues him from the criminals. While escaping, one of the criminals shoot them with burning arrows and one arrow hits the car, the car then burns and explodes.\n\nFailing to get any money, the woman who agreed to help Nardo gets angry and he runs from her naked and jumps right into a cocaine [[pickup truck]].

He gets to see Tracy through a hotel window but before he gets to her, he gets caught by a guard and sent to jail.\n\nAfter that, Nardo sends for help by making a phone call to Evan.
