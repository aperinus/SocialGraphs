Linz]] and [[Haviland Morris]]. The film tells the story of an 8-year-old boy who defends his home from a dangerous band of international criminals working for a terrorist organization. It is the third film in the [[Home Alone (franchise)|''Home Alone'' franchise]], and the first not to feature actor [[Macaulay Culkin]], director [[Chris Columbus (filmmaker)|Chris Columbus]], or composer [[John Williams]]. It is also the final film in the ''Home Alone'' franchise to receive a theatrical release.\n\nThe film was met with mixed reviews.\n\nThe film was followed by a [[television film|made-for-television]] sequel, ''[[Home Alone 4: Taking Back the House]]'', in 2002.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 to 700 words only. -->\nPeter Beaupre, Alice Ribbons, Burton Jernigan, and Earl Unger are four internationally wanted criminals who work for a terrorist organization. In [[Silicon Valley, California]], they steal a $10 million missile-cloaking [[Integrated circuit|microchip]] and hide it inside a remote control toy car to sneak it past security at [[San Francisco International Airport]]. However, a luggage mix-up causes a [[Chicago]]-bound elderly passenger named Mrs. Hess to inadvertently take the thieves' bag containing the car. The four thieves arrive in Chicago and systematically search every house in Mrs. Hess's suburban neighborhood to find the chip.\n\nEight-year-old Alex Pruitt is given the remote control car by Mrs. Hess for shoveling her driveway, but she lectures him for scratching in public. He returns home and discovers that he has [[chickenpox]] and must stay out of school. The next day, Alex discovers the thieves while spying on his neighbors. After two failed attempts at reporting them, Alex attaches a camera to the remote control car and uses it to spy on them, leading to the thieves chasing it when they spot it. Wondering what they want with the toy car, Alex opens it and discovers the stolen chip. He informs the local Air Force Recruitment Center about the discovery and asks if they can forward the information about the chip to the right authorities.\n\nThe thieves finally deduce that Alex has been watching them and decide to break into his house. Alex rigs the house with [[booby trap]]s with help from his pet rat Doris and his brother's loud-mouthed parrot. Beaupre, Alice, Jernigan and Unger break in, spring the traps, and suffer various injuries. While the four pursue Alex around the house, he flees and rescues Mrs. Hess, who has been duct taped to a chair in her garage by Alice. Beaupre ambushes Alex, but the latter uses a bubble gun resembling a [[Glock]] to scare him off.\n\nMeanwhile, FBI agents and Chicago PD officers arrive at Alex's siblings' school after a tipoff from the recruitment center. Alex's family brings the agents and the police to their house, where they arrest Alice, Jernigan, and Unger. However, Beaupre hides in the [[snow fort]] in the backyard. The parrot drives the remote control car into the fort and threatens to light fireworks, which are lined around the inside. Beaupre offers a cracker in exchange for silence, but the parrot demands two. Since Beaupre has only one, the parrot then lights the fireworks and flees. Beaupre is discovered and arrested.\n\nLater, the Pruitts, Hess, and the authorities hold a celebration for Alex as the Pruitt house is being repaired, with Jack returning home from a business trip. Beaupre's group are shown to have contracted Alex's chickenpox during their mugshots.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Alex D.
