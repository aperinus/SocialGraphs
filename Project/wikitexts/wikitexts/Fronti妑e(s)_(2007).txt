It follows a group of young criminals from [[Paris]] who lodge at a countryside inn run by [[Neo-Nazism|neo-Nazis]] in the aftermath of riots spurred by a controversial presidential election.\n\nAfter its premiere in [[France]] at the Agde Film Festival in 2007, the film was given a [[limited release]] with an [[NC-17]] rating in the United States on May 9, 2008, as part of the [[After Dark Horrorfest]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Horror's New Frontiers|url=http://www.eyeforfilm.co.uk/feature.php?id=447|work= EyeForFilm|accessdate=18 November 2017|author=Amner, Darren|archivedate=September 21, 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150921172834/http://www.eyeforfilm.co.uk/feature/2007-10-24-xavier-gens-interview-about-frontieresfrontiers-feature-story-by-darren-amner}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nA [[Far-right politics|far-right]] candidate reaches the second round of the election for the [[President of France|French presidency]], sparking riots in [[Paris]]. Hoping to escape Paris but needing cash, a street gang made up of [[Muslims in France|Muslim]] [[Arabs in France|Arab]] youths; Alex, Tom, Farid, the pregnant Yasmine, and her brother Sami take advantage of the chaos to pull off a robbery. Sami is shot, and the group splits up: Alex and Yasmine take Sami to a hospital, and Tom and Farid take the money to a family-run inn near the border. Innkeepers Gilberte and Klaudia claim their rooms are free and seduce the two men.\n\nAt the hospital, the emergency room staff report Sami's injury to the police. Sami insists Yasmine run before the police catch her. His dying wish is that Yasmine not have an abortion. Alex and Yasmine flee, leaving the fatally wounded Sami behind. Alex and Yasmine phone their friends for directions to the inn. Tom and Farid give them directions but soon after are brutally attacked by Gilberte, Klaudia, and Goetz. When Tom and Farid try to escape, Goetz runs their car off a cliff. The injured men wander into a mine shaft, where Tom is quickly recaptured. Farid must fend for himself with the family's rejected children in the mine. Unaware of the danger, Alex and Yasmine arrive at the inn and are captured by the family.\n\nAlex and Yasmine are chained in a muddy-floored pigpen. Alex breaks Yasmine's chains and allows her to escape. When the captors discover Yasmine's escape, the family patriarch, von Geisler, cuts Alex's [[Achilles tendons]]. Meanwhile, in the mine, Farid finds the storage area for the victims. The family realizes something is amiss in the mine, and Hans chases Farid into a boiler where Farid is cooked alive. Yasmine flees from the inn but is quickly picked back up by Goetz. Back in the pigpen, von Geisler personally grants Alex's last wish to be put down quickly. Initially, von Geisler wishes for Karl to \"wed\" Yasmine to carry on the family lineage, but when von Geisler learns she is already pregnant, he entrusts her to the meek Eva, who tells Yasmine that she came to the family in a very similar manner and that she is obedient because the family promised her that her parents would return for her some day. Eva also tells Yasmine of the rejected homeless children she and Hans care for in the mine.\n\nEventually, Eva leads Yasmine down to dinner, where the family awaits her. Von Geisler is revealed to be a former (and still practicing) [[Nazism|Nazi]] who's lived at the inn since the end of [[World War II|WWII]]. Von Geisler offers up a toast to the new blood, and Yasmine quickly grabs a large knife and takes von Geisler hostage. Hans grabs a shotgun and shoots von Geisler in the confusion; Karl shoots Hans dead in turn. Yasmine escapes and is chased by Karl and Goetz into the mine. Yasmine eventually makes her way into one of the body storage rooms, where she fights with Goetz. After a bloody struggle, she repeatedly hits him with an axe before impaling him on a rotating [[table saw]]. Karl catches Yasmine as she tries to return to the surface, but Eva comes to the rescue, blowing off Karl's head with a shotgun. Yasmine searches for car keys to escape but is ambushed by Gilberte and Klaudia bearing sub-machine guns. Yasmine hits a gas tank during the shootout, blowing up the room. Gilberte survives the explosion and attempts to kill Yasmine, only to have her throat torn out by her. With everyone else in the neo-Nazi family dead, Yasmine tries to persuade Eva to leave with her, but Eva stays to take care of the children in the mine. On the road, one hears on the radio that the far-right candidate in the election has won the second round, thus becoming the new French President. Yasmine runs into a police blockade near the border, where she surrenders to the authorities.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Karina Testa]] as Yasmine\n* [[Estelle Lef\u00e9bure]] as Gilberte\n* [[Aur\u00e9lien Wiik]] as Alex\n* [[Samuel Le Bihan]] as Goetz\n* David Saracino as Tom\n* [[Chems Dahmani]] as Farid\n* [[Adel Bencherif]] as Sami\n* [[Maud Forget]] as Eva\n* Am\u00e9lie Daure as Klaudia\n* Rosine Favey as The mother\n* Jo\u00ebl Lefran\u00e7ois as Hans\n* Patrick Ligardes as Karl\n* Jean-Pierre Jorris as Von Geisler\n\n==Release==\n''Frontier(s)'' was intended to be one of the [[8 Films to Die For]] at Horrorfest 2007, but when the [[Motion Picture Association of America|MPAA]] gave the film an [[NC-17]] rating, it was instead released unrated to ten US theaters for one weekend, grossing $9,913.
