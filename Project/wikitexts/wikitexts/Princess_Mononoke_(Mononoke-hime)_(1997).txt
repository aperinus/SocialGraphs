The film stars the voices of [[Y\u014dji Matsuda]], [[Yuriko Ishida]], [[Y\u016bko Tanaka]], [[Kaoru Kobayashi (actor)|Kaoru Kobayashi]], [[Masahiko Nishimura]], [[Tsunehiko Kamijo]], [[Akihiro Miwa]], [[Mitsuko Mori]] and [[Hisaya Morishige]].\n\n''Princess Mononoke'' is set in the late [[Muromachi period]] of Japan (approximately 1336 to 1573 CE), but it includes fantasy elements. The story follows a young [[Emishi]] prince named Ashitaka, and his involvement in a struggle between the gods of a forest and the humans who consume its resources. The term {{Nihongo|''[[mononoke]]''|{{linktext|\u7269\u306e\u602a}}}}, or {{lang|ja|\u3082\u306e\u306e\u3051}}, is not a name, but a Japanese word for supernatural, shape-shifting beings that possess people and cause suffering, disease, or death.\n\nThe film was released in Japan on July 12, 1997 by [[Toho]], and in the United States on October 29, 1999. It was a critical and commercial [[blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbuster]], becoming the highest-grossing film in Japan of 1997, and also held Japan's box office record for domestic films until 2001's ''[[Spirited Away]]'', another Miyazaki film. It was [[dubbing (filmmaking)|dubbed]] into English with a script by [[Neil Gaiman]] and initially distributed in North America by [[Miramax]], where it sold well on DVD and video, despite a poor box office performance. The film greatly increased Ghibli's popularity and influence outside Japan.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for films should be between 400 to 700 words. Please check the word count before making any additions. Please go to the talk page before making any major changes. -->\nIn [[Muromachi period|Muromachi]] Japan, an [[Emishi]] village is attacked by a hideous demon. The last Emishi prince, Ashitaka, kills it before it reaches the village, but it manages to grasp his arm and curse him before its death. The curse grants him superhuman strength, but it also causes him pain and will eventually kill him. The villagers discover that the demon was a boar god, corrupted by an iron ball lodged in his body. The village's wise woman tells Ashitaka that he may find a cure in the western lands that the demon came from, and that he cannot return to his homeland.\n\nHeading west, Ashitaka meets Jigo, an opportunistic monk who tells Ashitaka he may find help from the Great Forest Spirit, a deer-like animal god by day and a giant [[Daidarabotchi|Night Walker]] by night. Nearby, men on a cliffside herd oxen to their home of Iron Town, led by Lady Eboshi, and repel an attack by a wolf pack led by the wolf goddess Moro, whom Eboshi wounds with a gun shot. Riding one of the wolves is San, a human girl. Down below, Ashitaka encounters San and the wolves, who rebuff his greeting. He then manages to rescue two of the men fallen from the cliff and transports them back through the forest, where he briefly glimpses the Great Forest Spirit.\n\nAshitaka and the survivors arrive at Iron Town, where he is greeted with fascination. Iron Town is a refuge for outcasts and [[leper]]s employed to process iron and create firearms, such as [[hand cannon]]s and [[Matchlock|matchlock muskets]]. Ashitaka learns that the town was built by [[clearcutting]] forests to mine the iron, leading to conflicts with Asano, a local [[daimy\u014d]], and a giant boar god named Nago. Eboshi admits that she shot Nago, incidentally turning him into the demon that attacked Ashitaka's village. She also reveals that San, dubbed ''Princess Mononoke'', was raised by the wolves and hates humankind.\n\nSan infiltrates Iron Town to kill Eboshi. Ashitaka intervenes and quickly subdues Eboshi and San while they are locked in combat. Amidst the hysteria he is shot by a villager, but the curse gives him strength to carry San out of the village. San awakens and prepares to kill the weakened Ashitaka, but hesitates when he tells her that she is beautiful. She decides to trust him after the Forest Spirit heals his bullet wound that night. The next day, a boar clan led by the blind god Okkoto plans to attack Iron Town to save the forest. Eboshi sets out to kill the Forest Spirit with Jigo; Eboshi intends to give the god's head to the [[Emperor of Japan|Emperor]] (who believes it will grant him immortality) in return for protection from Lord Asano, while Jigo desires the large reward being offered.\n\nAshitaka recovers and finds Iron Town besieged by Asano's [[samurai]]. The boar clan has also been annihilated in battle, and Okkoto is badly wounded. Jigo's men trick Okkoto into leading them to the Forest Spirit. San tries to stop Okkoto but is swept up as his pain corrupts him into a demon. As everyone clashes at the pool of the Forest Spirit, Ashitaka saves San while the Forest Spirit euthanizes Moro and Okkoto. As it begins to transform into the Night Walker Eboshi decapitates it. Jigo steals the head, while the Forest Spirit's body bleeds ooze that spreads over the land and kills anything it touches. The forest and [[Kodama (spirit)|kodama]] begin to die; Moro's head briefly comes alive and bites off Eboshi's right arm, but she survives. Enraged, San attempts to kill Eboshi again, but is stopped by Ashitaka, who consoles her and encourages her not to give up.\n\nAfter Iron Town is evacuated, Ashitaka and San pursue Jigo and retrieve the head, returning it to the Forest Spirit. The Spirit dies but its form washes over the land, healing it and lifting Ashitaka's curses. Ashitaka stays to help rebuild Iron Town, but promises San he will visit her in the forest. Eboshi vows to build a better town. The forest begins to regrow as a single Kodama emerges from the brush.\n\n==Cast and characters==\n* [[Y\u014dji Matsuda]] voices {{nihongo|Ashitaka|\u30a2\u30b7\u30bf\u30ab}}, the last [[Ainu people|Ainu]] prince of the Emishi tribe whose traveling companion is {{nihongo|Yakul|\u30e4\u30c3\u30af\u30eb|Yakkuru}}, a {{nihongo|red elk|\u30a2\u30ab\u30b7\u30b7|Akashishi}}, a fictional species of [[elk]] that Miyazaki created for the film.

Speaking at the International Symposium on Leprosy / Hansen's Disease History in Tokyo, Miyazaki explained that he was inspired to portray people living with leprosy, \"said to be an incurable disease caused by bad karma\", after visiting the [[Tama Zenshoen Sanatorium]] near his home in Tokyo.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://ajw.asahi.com/article/behind_news/social_affairs/AJ201601290032 |title=Hayao Miyazaki: Leprosy scene in 'Mononoke Hime' inspired by real-life experience |last=Kitano |first=Ryuichi |newspaper=[[Asahi Shimbun]] |date=January 29, 2016 |access-date=January 29, 2016 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160130093058/http://ajw.asahi.com/article/behind_news/social_affairs/AJ201601290032 |archive-date=January 30, 2016 }}</ref> Lady Eboshi is driven by her compassion for the disabled, and believes that blood from the Great Forest Spirit could allow her to \"cure [her] poor lepers\".<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Wendi|first1=Sierra|last2=Alysah|first2=Berwald|last3=Melissa|first3=Guck|last4=Erica|first4=Maeder|date=January 1, 2015|title=Nature, Technology, and Ruined Women: Ecofeminism and Princess Mononoke|url=http://digitalcommons.brockport.edu/sfd/vol1/iss1/5/|journal=The Seneca Falls Dialogues Journal|language=en|volume=1|issue=1}}</ref> Michelle Jarman, Assistant Professor of Disability Studies at the [[University of Wyoming]], and Eunjung Kim, Assistant Professor of Gender and Women's Studies at the [[University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison]], said the disabled and gendered sexual bodies were partially used as a transition from the feudal era to a hegemony that \"embraces modern [[social system]]s, such as [[industrialization]], gendered division of labor, [[institutionalization]] of people with diseases, and [[militarization]] of men and women.\" They likened Lady Eboshi to a [[monarch]].{{Sfn|Kim|Jarman|2008|p=54}} Kim and Jarman suggested that Eboshi's disregard of ancient laws and curses towards sex workers and lepers was enlightenment reasoning and her exploitation of disabled people furthered her modernist viewpoints.{{Sfn|Kim|Jarman|2008|pp=56\u201357}} Kim and Jarman conclude that Lady Eboshi's supposed benevolence in incorporating lepers and sex workers into her society leverages the social stigma attached to marginalized groups, pointing out that the hierarchical structures within Irontown still support the stigmatization of lepers and sex workers.{{Sfn|Kim|Jarman|2008|p=58}}\n\nAn additional theme is the morally ambiguous conflict between humankind's growth and development and Nature's need for preservation. According to the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]''{{'}}s [[Roger Ebert]], \"It is not a simplistic tale of good and evil, but the story of how humans, forest animals and nature gods all fight for their share of the new emerging order.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/princess-mononoke-1999|title=Princess Mononoke |last=Ebert |first=Roger |publisher=Rogerebert.com |date=October 29, 1999 |access-date=January 29, 2016}}</ref> Billy Crudup, who provided the English voice for Ashitaka, said \"The movie was such an entirely different experience; it had a whole new sensibility I had never seen in animation. It also had something profound to say: that there has to be a give and take between man and nature. One of the things that really impressed me is that Miyazaki shows life in all its multi-faceted complexity, without the traditional perfect heroes and wicked villains. Even Lady Eboshi, who Ashitaka respects, is not so much evil as short-sighted.\" Minnie Driver, the English voice actress for Lady Eboshi, commented similarly: \"It's one of the most remarkable things about the film: Miyazaki gives a complete argument for both sides of the battle between technological achievement and our spiritual roots in the forest. He shows that good and evil, violence and peace exist in us all. It's all about how you harmonize it all.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ex.org/4.7/06-event_mononoke.html |title=The Remaking of a Myth: Princess Mononoke in America |last=McCarter |first=Charles |publisher=Ex.org \u2013 EX: The Online World of Anime & Manga |date=October 20, 1999 |access-date=January 29, 2016 |url-status=unfit |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100806214532/http://www.ex.org/4.7/06-event_mononoke.html |archive-date=August 6, 2010}}</ref> Anime historian [[Susan Napier]] said there is no clear good vs. evil conflict in ''Princess Mononoke'', unlike other films popular with children. Based on the multiple point of views the film adopts, San and Lady Eboshi can simultaneously be viewed as heroic or villainous. San defends the forest and viewers empathize with her. But she also attacks innocent people, complicating how we evaluate her. Opposed to San, Eboshi tries to destroy the forest and could be considered a villain. But everything she does is out of a desire to protect her village and see it prosper. San and Lady Eboshi survive until film's end, defying the usual convention of good triumphing over evil with the antagonist defeated. Napier concluded that the resolution of the conflict is left ambiguous, implying that Lady Eboshi and San will be able to come to some sort of compromise. The ambiguity suggests that there are no true villains or heroes.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Napier|first1=Susan J.|title=Anime from Akira to Princess Mononoke|url=https://archive.org/details/animefromakirato00napi|url-access=registration|date=2001|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan US|isbn=9780312238636|pages=[https://archive.org/details/animefromakirato00napi/page/175 175\u2013192]}}</ref>\n\nDan Jolin of ''[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]'' said that a potential theme could be that of lost innocence. Miyazaki attributes this to his experience of making his previous film, ''[[Porco Rosso]]'', and the [[Yugoslav Wars|wars in the former Yugoslavia]], which he cites as an example of mankind never learning, making it difficult for him to go back to making a film such as ''[[Kiki's Delivery Service]]'', where he has been quoted as saying \"It felt like children were being born to this world without being blessed. How could we pretend to them that we're happy?\"<ref>{{cite magazine|author=Dan Jolin|date=September 2009|title=Miyazaki on Miyazaki: The animation genius on his movies|url=https://www.empireonline.com/movies/features/hayao-miyazaki/|magazine=[[Empire (film magazine)|Empire]]|access-date=May 6, 2015}}</ref>\n\nDuality is central to Eboshi's characterization. Benjamin Thevenin, Assistant Professor of Theater and Media Arts at [[Brigham Young University]], said Eboshi does not fully understand the harm she does to the spirits. Her focus is on creating a safe home for her people. She holds no malicious intent toward nature and its spirits until they begin attacking her people. Once nature attacks, she gathers her soldiers to protect the inhabitants of her town, a place where all are welcome. Irontown is a haven for former sex workers and lepers. She brings them to Irontown and gives them jobs, hospitality, and a kindness that they have never experienced before. The same treatment goes for all Irontown's inhabitants, not just the sickly and the scorned. Lady Eboshi treats everyone equally, no matter the race, sex, or history of the individual, creating a caring community. While Eboshi hates San and the forest spirits, she keeps a garden in her town. Her care for the garden implies that her intention is not to ravage nature to no end, but rather to help her own people. Thevenin concluded that although Eboshi can be seen as the film's villain, she is also a hero to the citizens of Irontown and to humankind in general.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Thevenin |first1=Benjamin |title=Princess Mononoke and beyond: New nature narratives for children |journal=Interactions: Studies in Communication & Culture |date=1 October 2013 |volume=4 |issue=2 |pages=147\u2013170 |doi=10.1386/iscc.4.2.147_1 }}</ref>\n\nAnother theme in this film is between [[individualism]] and societal [[conformity]]. According to [[University of Bristol]] professors Christos Ellinas, Neil Allan and Anders Johansson, this struggle can be seen between San, a strong individualistic force, and Eboshi, the leader of a great society. San has fully committed to living with the wolves in the forest and to renouncing her association with the human race. Eboshi has vowed to sustain her society of Irontown by any means including destroying the environment. The people of Irontown have a cohesive ideology and agree with Eboshi to protect Irontown at the cost of the environment's destruction. This conformity can be found within their society, because \u201ceven though there is an envisioned culture at which an organization abides to [sic], achieving coherence at lower aggregation levels (e.g. individuals) is increasingly challenging due to its emergent nature\u201d.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Ellinas|first1=Christos|last2=Allan|first2=Neil|last3=Johansson|first3=Anders|date=June 30, 2017|title=Dynamics of organizational culture: Individual beliefs vs. social conformity|journal=PLOS ONE|volume=12|issue=6|pages=e0180193|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0180193|pmid=28665960|pmc=5493361|issn=1932-6203|arxiv=1708.06736|bibcode=2017PLoSO..1280193E|doi-access=free}}</ref>\n\n== Release ==\n''Princess Mononoke'' was released theatrically in Japan on July 12, 1997.{{sfn|Galbraith IV|2008|p=414}} The film was extremely successful in Japan and with both [[anime]] fans and [[arthouse]] moviegoers in English-speaking countries.

The music was performed by Tokyo City Philharmonic Orchestra and conducted by Hiroshi Kumagai. The soundtrack was released in Japan by Tokuma Japan Communications on July 2, 1997, and the North American version was released by [[Milan Records]] on October 12, 1999.\n\nThe titular theme song was performed by [[counter-tenor]] [[Yoshikazu Mera]].
