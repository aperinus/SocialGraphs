Directed by [[Raoul Walsh]] and starring [[Errol Flynn]], the film was made by [[Warner Bros.]] immediately after the raid.\n{{TOC limit|limit=2}}\n\n==Plot==\n[[File:Errol Flynn in Operation Burma.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Errol Flynn]] playing Captain Nelson, the group's heroic leader. ]]\nA group of [[U.S. Army|United States Army]] paratroopers led by Captain Nelson are dropped into Burma to locate and destroy a camouflaged [[Imperial Japanese Army|Japanese Army]] radar station that is detecting Allied aircraft flying into China. For their mission, they are assigned [[Gurkha]] guides, a [[Chinese Army in India|Chinese Army]] Captain and an older [[war correspondent]] whose character is used to explain various procedures to the audience.\n\nThe mission is an overwhelming success as the 36-man team quickly take out the station and its personnel. But when the airborne troops arrive at an old airstrip to be taken back to their base, they find the Japanese waiting for them at their rendezvous site. Captain Nelson makes the hard decision to call off the rescue planes, and hike out on foot.\n\nTo reduce the likelihood of detection, the group then splits up into two smaller units to meet up at a deserted Burmese village. But when Nelson arrives at the meeting place, he finds that the other team had been captured, tortured and mutilated by the Japanese. Only Lt. Jacobs survives, and he too dies after telling Nelson what had happened.  The surviving soldiers are then attacked and are forced again to retreat into the jungle. The men must then cross the swamps in their attempt to make it back to safety through enemy-occupied jungle.\n\nFighting an almost constant rearguard action, Nelson's paratroopers also succeed as decoys leading Japanese troops away from the site of the [[British Army|British]] [[Chindits#Operation Thursday|1944 aerial invasion of Burma]].\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Errol Flynn]] as Captain Nelson\n* [[James Brown (actor)|James Brown]] as SSgt.
