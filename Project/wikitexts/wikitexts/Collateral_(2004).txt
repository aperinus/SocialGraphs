The supporting cast includes [[Jada Pinkett Smith]], [[Mark Ruffalo]], [[Peter Berg]], [[Javier Bardem]], and [[Bruce McGill]]. The film follows Max Durocher, a Los Angeles cab driver, and his customer, Vincent. When offered a high fare for driving to several locations, Max agrees but soon finds himself taken hostage by Vincent who turns out to be a hitman on a contract killing spree.\n\nScreenwriter Beattie first conceived the idea for the film when taking a [[taxicab]] home from [[Sydney]] airport. Beattie shared the idea with producer Julie Richardson, who showed it to director [[Frank Darabont]]. The film was pitched to [[HBO]] but was declined. It was purchased by [[DreamWorks Pictures|DreamWorks]] but would not see development for three years. Before the trio of Mann, Cruise and Foxx joined the film, [[Mimi Leder]], [[Janusz Kami\u0144ski]] and [[Fernando Meirelles]] were each considered as director, and [[Russell Crowe]] and [[Adam Sandler]] were in talks to star as Vincent and Max, respectively. Filming primarily took place throughout [[Los Angeles]], and was the first feature film to be shot with a [[Viper FilmStream High-Definition Camera]]. The musical score was composed by [[James Newton Howard]], with additional songs from [[Audioslave]] and [[Paul Oakenfold]].\n\n''Collateral'' was released in the United States on August 6, 2004, and grossed over $220 million worldwide. The film received critical acclaim in particular for the performances of Cruise and Foxx, Mann's direction and the editing, although the overall pacing and second half of the film received a mixed reception. ''Collateral'' was chosen by the [[National Board of Review]] as one of the [[National Board of Review Awards 2004#Top 10 Films|top ten films of 2004]]. At the [[77th Academy Awards]], Foxx received a nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Supporting Actor]]; while film editors [[Jim Miller (film editor)|Jim Miller]] and [[Paul Rubell]] were nominated for [[Academy Award for Best Film Editing|Best Film Editing]].\n\n==Plot==\nMax Durocher is a meticulous Los Angeles cab driver trying to earn enough to start his own limousine business. One of the evening's fares is federal prosecutor Annie Farrell, who works for the U.S. Attorney for the [[United States District Court for the Central District of California|Central District of California]]. On the drive to her office, they strike up a conversation and Annie gives Max her business card.\n\nMax's next fare is Vincent. Vincent tells Max that he is in Los Angeles for one night to complete a real estate deal, and offers Max $600 to drive him to several locations. Initially reluctant to violate regulations, Max eventually agrees. As Max waits at the first stop, a corpse falls onto his car. Vincent reveals himself to be a [[Contract killing|hitman]] and the body is one of five targets. He forces Max to hide the body in the trunk and continue driving. LAPD undercover narcotics detective Ray Fanning arrives at the building where Vincent made the kill, and reveals the victim was a police informant.\n\nAt the second stop, Vincent restrains Max's hands to the steering wheel. Max asks a group of young men for help, but two of them rob him and seize Vincent's briefcase. Vincent shoots them both dead and retrieves the briefcase. Fanning arrives at the hospital morgue to see the bodies of criminal lawyer Sylvester Clark, Vincent's second target, and two dead robbers, and realizes that this is the work of a hitman.\n\nVincent orders Max to a jazz club. At the club, Vincent engages the owner Daniel in conversation. Vincent then reveals Daniel to have been his third target, as Daniel is set to testify against Vincent's client. Max pleads with Vincent to let Daniel go, causing Vincent to offer a compromise, betting Daniel cannot answer a question about [[Miles Davis]]. Daniel seemingly gives a correct answer, but Vincent unexpectedly shoots Daniel in the head, dissatisfied with his answer.\n\nLearning of Max's nightly visits to the hospital to see his mother, Vincent insists that Max proceed with the visit, where they inadvertently encounter Fanning in the hospital elevator but remain anonymous to each other. At the hospital, Ida is dismissive of her son's efforts but acts warmly around Vincent. She proudly tells Vincent that Max has his own limousine company, revealing Max has been lying to her for her approval.\n\nOverwhelmed, Max leaves, steals Vincent's briefcase, and hurls it onto a freeway where it is destroyed by a passing truck. With the information on his last two targets destroyed, Vincent coerces Max to meet drug lord Felix Reyes-Torrena to re-obtain the information. Max, posing as Vincent, acquires the information but Reyes-Torrena orders his men to kill \"Vincent\" if he does not complete the job.\n\nMax heads with Vincent to a nightclub, seeking the next target, Peter Lim. Fanning, while seeking a connection between the three victims, visits FBI agent Frank Pedrosa. Pedrosa identifies the victims as witnesses in a federal grand jury indicting Reyes-Torrena the following day. Pedrosa thinks that Max is the hitman, based on FBI surveillance of Max entering and leaving Reyes-Torrena's bar, and orders the FBI agents to protect Lim. At the nightclub, Vincent kills Reyes-Torrena's hitmen, Lim, and his bodyguards. Fanning rescues Max and smuggles him outside, but Vincent fatally shoots Fanning and coerces Max back into the cab.\n\nFollowing their getaway, Max and Vincent trade insults before Max deliberately crashes the cab. Vincent escapes, but a police officer tries to arrest Max after seeing the corpse in the trunk. Max notices Vincent's open laptop, revealing that his final target is Annie. Max overpowers the police officer with Vincent's gun and rushes toward Annie's office building.\n\nStealing a bystander's phone, Max calls Annie to warn her. Max reveals details about Vincent's previous victims, urging her to call 911. Vincent, who has armed himself with a gun from a security guard, corners Annie but is shot and wounded by Max, who escapes with Annie on foot. Vincent pursues the pair onto a [[Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority|metro rail train]]. Cornered on the train, Max engages Vincent in a sudden shootout. Vincent, fatally wounded, slumps into a seat. Max and Annie get off at the next station, as a deceased Vincent continues riding alone on the train.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Tom Cruise]] as Vincent\n* [[Jamie Foxx]] as Max Durocher\n* [[Jada Pinkett Smith]] as Annie Farrell \n* [[Mark Ruffalo]] as Ray Fanning\n* [[Peter Berg]] as Richard Weidner\n* [[Bruce McGill]] as Frank Pedrosa\n* [[Irma P.
