The film is about a bumbling male [[fairy godmother]] named Murray (Short), who tries to help Annabel (Wilson) fulfill her wish that her father, a carriage driver, wins the leading role in a [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] musical.\n\nIt was the last film from director Michael Ritchie before his death in 2001.<ref name=\"nat\">Nat Segaloff, ''Final Cuts: The Last Films of 50 Great Directors'', Bear Manor Media 2013 p 247-248</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nNYC horse carriage driver Oliver Greening ([[Robert Pastorelli]]) aspires to perform on Broadway and, despite an outstanding audition for ''[[A Tale of Two Cities]]'' musical, he loses out to seasoned Tony Sable ([[Alan Campbell (actor)|Alan Campbell]]), as he is considered more bankable, as Oliver's reputation as an actor is non-existent.\n\nLater that night, Annabel ([[Mara Wilson]]), Oliver's young daughter, doesn't convince her elder brother Charlie ([[Francis Capra]]) that fairy godmothers exist, and after they fall asleep, she awakens to find Murray ([[Martin Short]]), a male fairy godmother, in her room. Offering her one wish, she uses it to secure her father a role in the play so they don't have to move to Nebraska.\n\nHortence ([[Ruby Dee]]), the head fairy godmother, is holding the North American Fairy Godmothers Association (NAFGA)'s annual meeting. Her rule is, all participants must check in their wands before the meeting. Claudia ([[Kathleen Turner]]), former fairy godmother turned evil witch, has come to the meeting uninvited to steal all the wands. Putting Hortence's receptionist Rena ([[Teri Garr]]) to sleep with a witch's apple, she casts a spell on Hortence turning the head fairy paper-thin and binding her mouth. She then locks all the fairy godmothers downstairs on her way to stealing the wands. However Murray arrives late and never checks his wand, making it the only one Claudia doesn't have.\n\nWhen Annabel sees Murray has forgotten his magic wand, she plans to return it to him, but Charlie breaks it. Murray and Annabel end up in [[Nebraska]], by way of a his misconstrued spell to get out quickly. After unsuccessfully turning a selfish motel owner they meet into a rabbit (instead into a giant rabbi), they end up back in [[Central Park]]. As Annabel disappeared mysteriously, the school closes early. Charlie finds them.\n\nAnnabel begs Murray to grant her wish as they are near her father, but he accidentally turns Oliver into a statue. To fix it, the three go to NAFGA and ask Hortence for help, who is still under Claudia's spell. While Murray, Charlie and Rena (finally woken from the sleeping spell) fix Murray's wand, Hortence tells Annabel of Claudia's plot: the spell must be lifted before midnight, or Oliver will remain a statue forever. Claudia, meanwhile, has been searching for her wand. After going through them, she realizes it is missing, now belongs to Murray, so she is determined to recover it.\n\nAt the theatre, Annabel and Murray see Tony Sable, the selfish and conceited actor auditioning for Oliver's part. Knowing this could ruin her father's chances of being in the show, she asks Murray to sabotage the audition. First he tries to make it rain on the stage but it is dismissed as a simple technical problem and the audition continues. Then she asks him to give Sable a frog in his throat to impair his singing. He takes this too literally, and frogs start hopping out of Sable's mouth, shocking everyone.\n\nAnnabel and Murray celebrate, but Sable gets the part, as Oliver has not appeared. Boots ([[Amanda Plummer]]), Claudia's terrier turned lackey who has been seeking Murray, finds them. Murray mentions the story of [[Brer Rabbit]] to Annabel and together they beg her not to take them to Claudia's lair, so she does.\n\nClaudia confronts them, demanding her wand. When Murray tries to persuade Annabel not to tell her, as punishment, Claudia changes her and Murray into [[ballerina]]s, making them dance uncontrollably until one of them agrees to tell her.\n\nAnnabel keeps Claudia distracted until Charlie can give Murray his wand. Murray wins Boots' allegiance long enough to convince her to give it to him. Claudia attempts to attack him, but he tricks her into firing a spell that draws her into a mirror, which is subsequently shattered.\n\nMurray, Charlie, and Annabel return to Central Park and restore Oliver just in time. He is given the part of Sable's [[understudy]]. To finally grant Annabel's wish, Murray appears backstage and causes Sable to slip on a bucket and twist his ankle. The resultant temper tantrum gets him fired and Oliver, his understudy, takes over. Charlie and Annabel watch the show with Murray and the other fairy godmothers.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Martin Short]] as Murray\n* [[Mara Wilson]] as Annabel Greening\n* [[Robert Pastorelli]] as Oliver Greening\n* [[Francis Capra]] as Charlie Greening\n* [[Kathleen Turner]] as Claudia\n* [[Amanda Plummer]] as Boots\n* [[Ruby Dee]] as Hortence: The Head Of The Fairy Godmothers\n* [[Teri Garr]] as Rena\n* [[Jonathan Hadary]] as Lord Richard\n* [[Deborah Odell]] as Jeri\n* [[Alan Campbell (actor)|Alan Campbell]] as Tony Sable\n* [[Jack McGee (actor)|Jack McGee]] as Officer York\n* [[Lanny Flaherty]] as Duane\n\n==Reception==\nReception to the movie was negative, with Pixelated Geek's Cinerina stating that while the movie's jokes might not appeal to adults, the movie would have appeal for a younger audience.<ref>[http://pixelatedgeek.com/1997/07/a-simple-wish/ A Simple Wish] PixelatedGeek</ref> [[Roger Ebert]] gave the film one and half stars, saying \"When family audiences avoid inspired films like ''[[The Secret Garden (1993 film)|The Secret Garden]]'', ''[[A Little Princess (1995 film)|The Little Princess]]'' and ''[[Shiloh (film)|Shiloh]]'', why would they choose a pallid exercise like this?\"<ref>[http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19970711/REVIEWS/707110303/1023 A SIMPLE WISH (PG)]</ref> [[ReelViews]] and the Austin Chronicle both reviewed the film,<ref>[http://www.reelviews.net/movies/s/simple.html Review: A Simple Wish] ReelViews</ref> with the Chronicle stating that \"The concept's good...
