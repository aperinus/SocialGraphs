It is the third installment in the [[Jackass (franchise)#Films|''Jackass'' film series]], and the sequel to ''[[Jackass Number Two]]'' (2006). The film stars the regular ''Jackass'' cast of  [[Johnny Knoxville]], [[Bam Margera]], [[Ryan Dunn]], [[Steve-O]], [[Dave England]], [[Jason Acu\u00f1a|Wee Man]], [[Preston Lacy]], [[Ehren McGhehey|Danger Ehren]], and [[Chris Pontius]]. This is the last ''Jackass'' film to feature Dunn before his death in 2011 and Margera as a principal member before his departure in 2020 (Margera is briefly in ''[[Jackass Forever]]''). This is also the last ''Jackass'' film to feature a guest appearance by [[Rip Taylor]], who died in October 2019.\n\nThe film was theatrically released in the United States in the [[3D film|3D]] format on October 15, 2010, by [[Paramount Pictures]], marking the tenth anniversary of the [[Jackass (TV series)|''Jackass'' television series]]. It received generally positive reviews from critics. The film grossed $171.7 million worldwide against a production budget of $20 million. A sequel, titled ''[[Jackass Forever]]'', was released on February 4, 2022 to positive reviews.<ref name=\"2022Date\">{{Cite web |last1=D'Alessandro |first1=Anthony |last2=Tartaglione |first2=Nancy |title='Top Gun: Maverick' Flies From Thanksgiving To Memorial Day Weekend; 'Mission: Impossible 7' Ignites In Fall 2022 |url=https://deadline.com/2021/09/top-gun-maverick-flies-from-thanksgiving-to-memorial-day-weekend-mission-impossible-7-ignites-in-fall-2022-1234825624/ |website=[[Deadline Hollywood]] |access-date=September 1, 2021 |date=September 1, 2021}}</ref>\n\nUnused material of the film was released on a separate movie titled ''Jackass 3.5'', which was released on [[DVD]] and [[Blu-ray]] on June 14, 2011.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- DO NOT remove this notice. DO NOT DO A SUMMARY OF EACH STUNT IN THE MOVIE -->\n[[Beavis]] and [[Butt-Head]] open the film with an explaination of 3D technology; in a matter typical for the characters, they start arguing and quickly get into a slap-fight, with several of the moves especially animated to come out of the screen in a 3D setting. The opening sequence features the members lining up, standing in each color of the rainbow while an opera version of the ''Jackass'' theme song \"[[Corona (song)|Corona]]\" plays. Once [[Johnny Knoxville]] introduces the film, each cast member does small stunts by various objects in [[slow-motion]] to \"The Kids are Back\" by [[Twisted Sister]]. The opening sequence, as well as many of the stunts, were filmed with [[Vision Research Phantom|Phantom high speed cameras]] which shoot at 1,000 [[frames per second]].\n\nThe most notable stunts and pranks include; [[Johnny Knoxville]] being camouflage-painted as a bull charges at him, [[Bam Margera]] falling into a pit filled with snakes, [[Ryan Dunn]] playing the tuba while a male sheep rams him, [[Steve-O]] drinking [[Preston Lacy]]'s sweat after riding an elliptical, [[Jason Acu\u00f1a|Wee Man]] participating in a bar brawl with other [[dwarfism|little people]], Preston Lacy getting a football kicked against his face, [[Chris Pontius]] flying an [[RC helicopter]] as it's tied to his penis, [[Ehren McGhehey]] getting his crooked tooth pulled by Bam's [[Lamborghini Murci\u00e9lago|Lamborghini]], and [[Dave England]] playing [[tetherball]] with a beehive against Steve-O.\n\nThe final stunt involves Steve-O being launched in the air while inside a port-a-potty connected to bungee cords. The following closing skit is done in a similar fashion as the introduction, as Knoxville announces he's about to \"end the movie\", then triggers an old-fashioned dynamite plunger; after the rest of the crew is disappointed by the initial explosion being a mere puff of air out of a nearby [[pi\u00f1ata]], everything in the room is destroyed in a series of large explosions as the blown-up objects are thrown at the cast (like the opening, all shown in slow-motion) to the tune of [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky]]'s [[1812 Overture]]. After the explosions are finished, the cast members are flushed away by a wave pool. As in the past two ''Jackass'' films, comedian [[Rip Taylor]] makes an appearance before the credits roll, celebrating the end of the film in overly dramatic fashion.\n\n==Cast==\nThe entire cast from the previous movies returned for the third movie.\n* [[Johnny Knoxville]]\n* [[Bam Margera]]\n* [[Ryan Dunn]]\n* [[Steve-O]]\n* [[Jason Acu\u00f1a|Wee Man]]\n* [[Preston Lacy]]\n* [[Chris Pontius]]\n* [[Ehren McGhehey|Danger Ehren]]\n* [[Dave England]]\nGuest appearances:\n* [[The Dudesons]]\n* [[Loomis Fall]]\n* [[Brandon Novak]]\n* [[April Margera]], [[Phil Margera]], and [[Jess Margera]]\n* [[Rake Yohn]]\n* [[Terra Jol\u00e9]]\n* [[Mike Judge]] (as the voices of [[Beavis]] and [[Butt-head]])\n* [[Will Oldham]]\n* [[Rip Taylor]]\n* [[Half Pint Brawlers]]{{efn-ua|[[Stevie Lee]], 54, American professional wrestler and actor (''Puppet the Psycho Dwarf'', ''[[The Babe]]'', ''[[Oz the Great and Powerful]] '') who died on September 12, 2020.<ref>[https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/world-news/jackass-star-wrestler-stevie-lee-18917091 Jackass star and wrestler Stevie Lee dies 'unexpectedly' at 54]</ref><ref name=\"Hunt\">{{cite news |url=https://www.yahoo.com/news/jackass-star-stevie-lee-dies-101417990.html |title=Celebrity: 'Jackass' star Stevie Lee dies at the age of 54|first1=Julia |last1=Hunt |work=Yahoo Celebrity UK |date=September 11, 2020 |publisher=[[Yahoo!]]}}</ref>}}\n* Will \"The Farter\" Bakey\n* Animal experts [[Manny Puig]], David Weathers, Jason Deeringer, and [[Jules Sylvester]]\n* American Football players [[Erik Ainge]], [[Jared Allen]], and [[Josh Brown (American football)|Josh Brown]]\n* [[Wheelchair rugby]] player [[Mark Zupan (athlete)|Mark Zupan]]\n* Extreme sport athletes [[Mat Hoffman]], [[Tony Hawk]], [[Kerry Getz]], [[Eric Koston]] and [[Parks Bonifay]]\n* Actors [[Seann William Scott]], [[Edward Barbanell]], Jack Polick, John Taylor, Angie Simms and Dana Michael Woods\n* From ''[[Nitro Circus]]''; [[Andy Bell (freestyle motocross rider)|Andy Bell]], Erik Roner and Tommy \"Streetbike Tommy\" Passemante\n* From [[Weezer]]; [[Rivers Cuomo]], [[Brian Bell]] and [[Scott Shriner]]\n* Knoxville's daughter Madison and his son Rocko appear in the end credits\n\n=== Crew ===\nCrew members who appear in this movie:\n* Director and producer [[Jeff Tremaine]]\n* Producer [[Spike Jonze]]\n* Executive producer Trip Taylor\n* Associate producer Greg Wolf\n* Co-producer and [[cinematographer]] Dimitry Elyashkevich\n* Co-producer and photographer Sean Cliver\n* Cameramen [[Lance Bangs]], [[Rick Kosick]], and Greg Iguchi\n* Boom operator Seamus Frawley\n* Set decorator Mike Kassak\n* Art directors and production designers J.P.

based on a stunt originally done by Knoxville on the television show).<ref>The Making of Jackass 3D \u2013 MTV Special</ref> The stunt, \"The Lamborghini Tooth Pull\" was originally shot for ''[[Jackass Number Two]]'' with Margera's uncle, [[Vincent Margera]] (also known as Don Vito) but after [[Vincent Margera#Arrest, trial, and conviction|Margera's arrest]] back in 2006, the stunt was pulled from the final cut of the movie and was not shown in ''Jackass 2.5'', so it was re-shot with [[Ehren McGhehey]] for this film, and the elder Margera was declared persona non grata among the cast and crew for a time.\n\nIn April 2010, JackassWorld.com was closed, leaving a posting that said \"gone filmin',\" and \"Thanks for the support the past two years.
