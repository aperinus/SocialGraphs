He asks for Stanley Schupak (Bree's [[deadname]]), claiming to be her son. Bree was previously unaware she had a son; she now wants to break with her past and renounce him. However, Bree's [[psychotherapist|therapist]] refuses to sign off for her operation if she does not face up to her past ties.\n\nBree flies from [[Los Angeles]] to [[New York City]] to bail Toby out of jail. Toby is a foul-mouthed [[runaway (dependent)|runaway]] who is a small-time [[Substance abuse|drug user]] and [[male prostitute|male \"hustler\"]]. His mother committed [[suicide]] when he was a child after which he was raised by his stepfather, whom he says he does not want to see. Bree pretends to be a [[Christianity|Christian]] [[missionary]] and persuades Toby to ride with her back to the West Coast, secretly planning to leave him at his stepfather's along the way. When they arrive in the town of Callicoon, Kentucky,<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.catskillmountainkeeper.org/node/798 | title = Films set, or filmed in, the Catskills | work = Catskill Mountainkeeper | location = Youngsville, New York | access-date = 2011-05-23 | quote = Parts of the movie Transamerica (2005) starring Felicity Huffman were filmed in Callicoon, NY though in the movie it's referred to as Callicoon, KY | url-status = dead | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110625053320/http://catskillmountainkeeper.org/node/798 | archive-date = June 25, 2011 | df = mdy-all }}</ref> it turns out that Toby's stepfather was very [[abusive]] and he [[child sexual abuse|molested him]] several times in his youth. Bree and Toby continue driving to [[Los Angeles]] together. They also stop by a house in [[Dallas]] where a group of transgender women (many of whom are old friends of Bree's) are hosting a gender pride gathering. Later on in the trip, when Bree goes to the restroom, Toby accidentally discovers that Bree has [[male genitalia]]. He tries to be open-minded about it but is angry that Bree had not told him prior.\n\nAfter their car and money are stolen by a young hitchhiking [[hippie]] who calls himself a \"[[peyote]] [[Plastic shaman|shaman]]\", Toby makes some money by prostituting himself to a truck driver. To Bree he pretends that he got the money from selling some drugs he had taken along for his own use. They get a ride with a kindly rancher, Calvin Many Goats to Bree's parents' house in [[Phoenix, Arizona]]. Calvin and Bree hit it off and flirt a little, which disturbs Toby. Here they find her pampered and self-centred mother Elizabeth, her [[Jewish]] father Murray who seems to be dominated by Elizabeth, and her rebellious and sarcastic sister Sydney. Elizabeth disapproves of Bree's transition (it is mentioned that she has been estranged for some time), but is astonished to find out she has a grandson. She is kind to Toby and invites him to stay and live with them. Toby enjoys the luxury and kindness, but hesitates because he does not like how disrespectful they are to Bree. Misunderstanding his feelings for Bree, he tries to seduce her, saying that he will marry her if she wants. Bree realizes she must tell Toby the truth immediately, saying that she was his real father. Toby is appalled and infuriated that Bree had not disclosed this earlier. Overnight he steals money and valuable antiques from the house and disappears. Heartbroken, Bree returns to Los Angeles via a plane ticket bought by her parents. Her family finally accepts her calling herself Bree and she has a successful surgery, but is unhappy because she feels she will never again see or hear from Toby. The therapist visits Bree in recovery. After she confesses she made a mistake, Bree sobs on her shoulder.\n\nSome months later, Bree is surprised to see Toby at her front door. Bree invites him inside and he reveals to her he has turned 18, bleached his hair blonde, and has become an adult actor in [[Gay pornography|gay pornographic]] films in Los Angeles. Bree is also vibrant, happy, and enjoying her job as a waitress at the restaurant where she was formerly a busser; She has also dyed her hair blonde and now wears more colorful clothes. Bree and Toby reconcile, seemingly happy to have each other.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Felicity Huffman]] as Sabrina Claire \"Bree\" Osbourne \n* [[Kevin Zegers]] as Toby Wilkins, Bree's son\n* [[Graham Greene (actor)|Graham Greene]] as Calvin Many Goats\n* [[Fionnula Flanagan]] as Elizabeth Schupak, Bree's mom\n* [[Burt Young]] as Murray Schupak, Bree's dad\n* [[Carrie Preston]] as Sydney Schupak, Bree's sister\n* [[Elizabeth Pe\u00f1a]] as Margaret, Bree's psychiatrist\n* [[Venida Evans]] as Arletty\n* [[Teala Dunn]] as Little Girl\n* [[Calpernia Addams]] as Calpernia\n* [[Stella Maeve]] as Taylor\n* [[Raynor Scheine]] as Bobby Jensen, Toby's step-father\n* [[Danny Burstein]] as Dr. Spikowsky\n* [[Andrea James]] as the voice coach\n* Forrie J.
