It is a remake of the 1972 [[Bruce Lee]] film ''[[Fist of Fury]]''. \n\nSet in the [[Shanghai International Settlement]] in 1937, the film follows Chen as he investigates his old master [[Huo Yuanjia]]'s death at the hands of the [[Imperial Japanese Army|Imperial Japanese]] occupation forces.<ref>{{cite news |date=March 7, 2000 |title=Fist of Legend |work=[[IGN]] |url=http://uk.dvd.ign.com/articles/037/037106p1.html |access-date=2010-09-15}}</ref> The film co-stars [[Chin Siu-ho]], [[Yasuaki Kurata]], [[Shinobu Nakayama]], [[Billy Chow]] and [[Paul Chun]].

Thugs from the ultranationalist [[Black Dragon Society|Black Dragon Clan]] burst in and attempt to force him out because he is Chinese. Mitsuko, one of Chen's classmates who is in a romantic relationship with him, along with Chen's professor and classmates, defend his presence. The thugs turn violent but Chen easily defeats them using a variety of controlled [[Chin Na]] techniques. The Japanese thugs' [[sensei]], Fumio Funakoshi, who is also Mitsuko's uncle, arrives to take control of the situation and apologizes for his students' behavior. Funakoshi is impressed by Chen's skill and converses with him, and Chen learns that his [[sifu|master]], [[Huo Yuanjia]], has died after losing in a match against a Japanese [[karate]]ka named Akutagawa. Chen is distraught after hearing the bad news and he leaves [[Kyoto]] for [[Shanghai International Settlement|Shanghai]] immediately.\n\nChen returns to [[Chin Woo Athletic Association|Jingwu School]] and learns that his master's son, Ting'en, has become the new master. The next day, Chen goes to the Japanese [[dojo]] to challenge Akutagawa, who honorably accepts. Chen defeats Akutagawa easily and concludes that Akutagawa was not capable of defeating Huo, after which he suspects [[crime|foul play]] in his master's death. Chen has Huo's corpse exhumed for an autopsy against the wishes of Ting'en and his fellow Jingwu members. It is revealed that Huo was poisoned and weakened before his match against Akutagawa. Over the next few days, word of Chen's victory against Akutagawa spreads and Chen becomes a local celebrity in Shanghai. The Jingwu members begin to look up to Chen as their new instructor, which incurs the jealousy of Ting'en. Ting'en remains silent and seeks comfort in a brothel, where he becomes romantically involved with a prostitute.\n\nMeanwhile, Akutagawa confronts General Fujita of the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] after suspecting that his match against Huo had been rigged, which he considers dishonorable. After a heated argument, Fujita kills Akutagawa by breaking his back in front of the Japanese ambassador, and then places the blame on Chen. Enraged by their master's death, Akutagawa's students attack the Jingwu School, culminating in a fight that is eventually stopped by the local police. Chen is arrested and placed on trial for allegedly murdering Akutagawa. Several bribed witnesses provide false and conflicting accounts of the murder, but the court refuses to accept testimony from any Chinese defense witnesses on the grounds of bias towards Chen. Mitsuko shows up and testifies that Chen is innocent because he spent the night with her, and the court accepts her false testimony because she is Japanese. Chen is exonerated, but his apparent relationship with Mitsuko ruins his reputation because the Chinese view it as an act of betrayal against his fellow Chinese. Ting'en and the senior Jingwu members demand that Chen leaves either Mitsuko or the school. Huo uses the opportunity to settle his personal vendetta against Chen by challenging him to a fight. Although Chen defeats Ting'en, he still chooses to leave with Mitsuko. Huo feels humiliated by his defeat so he gives up his position as master of Jingwu before leaving to join his lover. Jingwu's members eventually discover Huo's relationship with her and reprimand him. Huo learns his lesson and returns to Jingwu.\n\nChen and Mitsuko face hostility from the locals and are forced to take shelter in an abandoned hut near Huo Yuanjia's grave. At the same time, Funakoshi arrives from Japan, as requested by Fujita, to eliminate Chen. Funakoshi engages Chen in a fight, which ends in a draw and the conclusion that if Chen learns to adapt to his opponent's moves, he will be unbeatable. Funakoshi leaves after warning Chen about Fujita's ill intentions and brutal methods. Days later, Huo Ting'en visits Chen and apologizes for his earlier behavior, saying that Jingwu School accepts Chen and Mitsuko's relationship now. Huo teaches Chen the [[Mizongyi|Mizong Fist]] that night while Mitsuko leaves secretly, leaving behind a message for Chen that she will wait for him in Japan.\n\nThe next day, Chen and Huo confront Fujita at his dojo, where Fujita exposes a traitor from Jingwu who played a role in Huo Yuanjia's death, and shoots him. Huo Ting'en then fights Fujita, who appears to be incredibly strong and resilient, and Huo suffers grave injuries. Chen engages Fujita in a long and exhausting fight, and eventually defeats him. Just as Chen and Huo are about to leave, the enraged Fujita comes after them with a [[katana]]. Huo pushes Chen out of the katana's way but is stabbed in the arm, and Chen is forced to kill Fujita. Japanese soldiers surround them and prepare to open fire. The Japanese ambassador, who is a [[pacifist]] against rising [[Japanese militarism|militarism in his country]], arrives and orders his soldiers to stand down. He agrees with Chen's actions as he has been aware that Fujita is a madman, but also warns them that the Japanese government will use Fujita's death as an excuse to start a war with China, unless the Chinese can account for Fujita's death by executing the murderer. Chen expresses his willingness to accept the blame for Fujita's death in order to prevent war, earning the ambassador's further admiration. Instead of ordering Chen's death, the ambassador stages a fake execution and substitutes the dead Jingwu's traitor's body for Chen's. Meanwhile, Chen secretly leaves Shanghai for [[Manchuria]].\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Jet Li]] as [[Chen Zhen (character)|Chen Zhen]] ({{lang-zh|\u9673\u771f}})\n* [[Chin Siu-ho]] as Huo Ting'en ({{lang-zh|\u970d\u5ef7\u6069|labels=no}})\n* [[Yasuaki Kurata]] as {{nihongo|Fumio Funakoshi|\u8239\u8d8a\u6587\u592b|Funakoshi Fumio|lead=yes}}\n* [[Shinobu Nakayama]] as {{nihongo|Mitsuko Yamada|\u5c71\u7530\u5149\u5b50|Yamada Mitsuko}}\n* [[Billy Chow]] as {{nihongo|General G\u014d Fujita|\u9678\u8ecd\u5927\u5c06 \u85e4\u7530|Rikugun-Taish\u014d Fujita G\u014d}}\n* Jackson Lau Hok-Yin as {{nihongo|Ry\u016bichi Akutagawa|\u82a5\u5ddd\u9f8d\u4e00|Akutagawa Ry\u016bichi}}\n* [[Paul Chun]] as Uncle Nong Jinsun ({{lang-zh|\u8fb2\u52c1\u84c0}})\n* [[Yuen Cheung-yan]] as Inspector Jie Yun-kui ({{lang-zh|\u63a2\u9577}})\n* [[Ada Choi]] as Xiao-hong ({{lang-zh|\u6653\u7ea2}})\n* Wong San as Uncle Kan\n* Toshimichi Takahashi as Japanese ambassador\n* [[Wallis Pang]] as Lan-fen\n* Lee Man-biu as Biu\n* Michael Lam Gong as Xiang\n* Tai Wooh-dang as Master Ngai\n* Tum Suk-mui as Wei\n* Gary Mak as Lun\n* Marco Lo as Sakamoto\n* Cheung Chun-Hung as Lin\n* Noel Rands as Dr. Smith\n* Kenji Tanigaki as Japanese fighter\n}}\n== Reception ==\n\n=== Box office ===\nThough ''Fist of Legend'' is widely considered one of Li's best films, during the downturn period of the Hong Kong film industry, its HK$14,785,382 box office gross was considered a disappointment. By comparison, Li's ''[[Fong Sai-yuk (film)|Fong Sai-yuk]]'' grossed over HK$30 million, and ''[[Fong Sai-yuk II]]'' grossed HK$23 million. However, its overall box office from other countries was good.\n\nIn South Korea, the film sold 181,760 tickets in [[Seoul City]].<ref>{{cite web |title=\uc601\ud654\uc815\ubcf4 |trans-title=Movie Information |url=http://www.kobis.or.kr/kobis/business/mast/mvie/searchMovieList.do |website=KOFIC |publisher=[[Korean Film Council]] |quote=First Of Legend |language=ko |access-date=26 August 2019 }}</ref>\n\n=== Critical response ===\nThe film holds a 100% rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]].<ref>[http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/fist-of-legend/ \"Jing wu ying xiong (Fist of Legend) (1994)\"]. [[Rotten Tomatoes]]. Retrieved 24 July 2013.</ref>\n\n=== Television ===\nIn the United Kingdom, the film (released as ''Jet Li's Fist of Legend'') was watched by {{Nowrap|1.1 million}} viewers on television in 2004, making it the year's seventh most-watched foreign-language film on television (below six other [[Hong Kong action films]]).<ref>{{Cite news |title=UK Film Council Statistical Yearbook: Annual Review 2004/05 |pages=74 |publisher=[[UK Film Council]] |url=https://www2.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/downloads/uk-film-council-statistical-yearbook-annual-review-2004-2005.pdf |access-date=21 April 2022 |via=[[British Film Institute]]}}</ref>\n\n==Alternate versions==\n\n===Miramax===\nThe English-dubbed U.S. release by [[Miramax Films|Miramax]] and [[Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures|Buena Vista Distribution]] contains four specific mistranslations that drastically alter the meaning of the film as a whole.\n\n# Before Chen leaves Japan, Mitsuko asks him if he hates the Japanese. In the U.S. version he replies, \"I don't hate.\" In the Hong Kong version he replies, \"I don't know.\"\n# In the U.S. version of the scene where Chen fights Fumio, Fumio asks him what the most effective way to defeat an enemy is. Chen replies that the most effective way is to focus one's energy and strike, and Fumio agrees with him. In the Hong Kong version, they begin by discussing their match. Chen says that the purpose of martial arts is to defeat an enemy. Fumio says, \"No, you're wrong. The best way to defeat your enemy is to use a gun. Martial arts is about personal development.\" The original line was a nod to [[Bruce Lee]], who was quoted during the production of ''[[Enter the Dragon]]'' as \"Nowadays you don't go around on the street kicking people, punching people \u2014 because if you do (makes gun shape with hand), well that's it \u2014 I don't care how good you are.\"<ref>{{Cite web |last=Jenness |first=Kirik |title=7 things you didn't know about Bruce Lee |url=https://www.mixedmartialarts.com/vault/7-things-didnt-know-bruce-lee |access-date=2022-11-01 |website=MMA Underground |language=en}}</ref>\n# Prior to the final fight sequence in the U.S. version, Chen and Huo face Fujita who holds up a sign reading ''Dongya Bingfu'' (\u6771\u4e9e\u75c5\u592b) and he tells them that the sign says, \"Jingwu is closed\". The Chinese characters are commonly translated to \"[[Sick man of Asia|Sick men of the East]]\" and is used as a famous reference to ''[[Fist of Fury]]''. The subtitles in the Hong Kong version translate the sign correctly.\n# At the end in the U.S. version, Chen's driver asks him if he will go to be with Mitsuko. Chen responds, \"If I no longer have a country, at least I can still be with the woman I love.\" His response in the Hong Kong version is, \"Where is war with Japan most likely to break out?\" The driver says, \"Manchuria\" and he says, \"We'll go to Manchuria then.\"\n\nWith regard to footage, this version deletes the final moments of students training and contains a brand new set of opening (animated) and closing credits in English, abandoning the previous ones completely.\n\n===Taiwan===\nCompared to the Hong Kong version, the 106-minute Mandarin-dubbed Taiwanese version contains the following footage:\n\n# An extension to the scene where Fujita gives a harsh lecture to several men, prior to his order to spy on certain Japanese individuals.\n# An extension of the scene with Chen after bowing to his master's shrine where Liu Zhensheng then hands over a suitcase to Chen and the latter proceeds to leave. Prior to following him, Mitsuko also respectfully bows.\n# An entire scene where Hill Hung is looking for Huo Ting'en at a brothel, only to find him smoking [[opium]] with a prostitute.\n# An entire scene where Hill Hung brings tea to Huo Ting'en, the night prior to the final match.\n# An extension of Fumio talking with the ambassador, prior to the former winning the Renju game.\n# After the final fight ends, a very small extension sees the Japanese soldiers pause for a moment prior to entering the Dojo.\n\nIn the Mandarin soundtracks of the film, there is background music when Chen fights Huo. However, in the Cantonese soundtrack, the music only plays after Chen performs a Capoeira-style kick later on in the fight.\n\n===Hong Kong===\nThe Hong Kong version in return, has the following unique footage:\n\n# A reaction shot of the cook in the kitchen (followed by a shot from Huo Yuanjia's shrine) after Uncle Nong dispatches students to search for Huo Ting'en.\n# A few seconds of Chen Zhen feigning death to Fujita.\n# After the credits finish, we see the crew waving to the camera.\n\nBoth Hong Kong and Taiwanese version have slightly different end credits.\n\n==Home media==\n\n===DVD===\n\n====Ritek====\nIn 1997, the first DVD was released by Ritek in [[Republic of China|Taiwan]], which fans later reported to be an \"uncut\" version. This has been a widely held misconception - whilst this version does carry some more footage (as a Taiwanese version), it is in turn missing a few moments that the Hong Kong version has.\n\n====Miramax====\nOn 15 February 2000, Miramax issued a DVD of this film in the [[United States|U.S.]] (later in the [[United Kingdom|U.K.]] too by [[Hollywood Pictures]] on VHS first, then DVD later on 29 March 2002). Whilst it featured better visual quality than any other release (some agree even to this day), it immediately caused an uproar with the [[Cinema of Hong Kong|Hong Kong Cinema]] fan community because it contained only a new English dub/score with alterations to the original dialogue and no original Cantonese option - a defect shared with many of their Hong Kong-acquired titles (not to mention the edits).\n\n====HKVideo====\nOn 20 March 2002, the first official DVD of the Hong Kong version with a Cantonese soundtrack was issued by HKVideo in [[France]]. However, it contained no English subtitles. One notable difference to other versions carrying a Chinese/Taiwanese version is that it doesn't contain the ending text describing the aftermath of Jingwu School, but is otherwise the same and, bar a few missing frames, uncut.\n\n====Maxam====\nA lesser-known DVD was issued on 25 March 2005 by Japanese [[Film distributor|distributor]] Maxam which contains the Hong Kong version (and its ending text) in complete form, but no English subtitles.\n\n====Dragon Dynasty====\nA [[Regional lockout|R1]] 2-DVD \"Ultimate Edition\" was finally released on 9 September 2008<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.collider.com/dvd/reviews/article.asp/aid/9245/tcid/3|title=FIST OF LEGEND Ultimate Edition DVD Review|last=Dellamorte|first=Andre|date=September 22, 2008|work=Collider|access-date=2010-09-15|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120814021914/http://www.collider.com/dvd/reviews/article.asp/aid/9245/tcid/3|archive-date=August 14, 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref> from [[The Weinstein Company]]'s [[Dragon Dynasty]] label in America, which features many extras and the original Cantonese soundtrack with English subtitles, marking the first official DVD release to do so. This version was also released in Australia ([[Regional lockout|Region 4]]), in single disk.\n\nHowever, this is still visually the previous US version with the Cantonese soundtrack edited to fit its visuals. Matters are worsened when the subtitles revert to [[dubtitle]]s towards the end - relying on the previous incorrectly transcribed \"Sick Men Of Asia\" sign and story-changing ending (see [[#Miramax|above]]) from Miramax's English dub.\n\n====New Age 21/HMH====\n[[Germany|German]]-issued DVDs from distributor 'New Age 21' (released 12 November 2008) and 'HMH' (released 20 November 2008) were released in an uncut state and contain a Cantonese soundtrack with English subtitles.\n\n====Other releases====\nOther uncut English-subtitled releases of the Hong Kong Cantonese-language versions (now [[Out of print|OOP]]) include the US Tai Seng [[VHS]] (released 20 October 2000), the [[Australia]]n Chinatown Video VHS, the [[United Kingdom|U.K.]] Made in Hong Kong VHS (released 1 October 1999), and the [[Mei Ah Entertainment|Mei Ah]] [[Video CD|VCD]], VHS and [[Laserdisc|LD]].\n\nThe [[Malaysia]]n Speedy VCD also contains a similar version, but enforces cuts to some scenes for violence:\n\n# Fujita kneeing Ry\u014dichi Akutagawa's back.\n# Huo Ting'en hitting his head on a window during the finale.\n# Chen Zhen hitting his head on a window during the finale.\n\nThe [[Spanish language|Spanish]] Manga Films DVD titled ''El Mejor Luchador'' (released 24 October 2001) and a slightly edited Indian Diskovery VCD titled ''The Hitter: Fist of the Legend'' contain an English-dubbed version intended for export to English-speaking territories. Strangely, this version has aired occasionally on US TV with a Miramax [[Station identification|ident]] instead of their own produced version.\n\n===Blu-ray===\nCine Asia released a Blu-ray version 22 March 2010 in the UK and on 20 April 2010 in USA.\n\n== Legacy ==\n''Fist of Legend'' inspired [[the Wachowskis]] to hire [[Choreography|choreographer]] [[Yuen Woo-ping]] for the fight scenes in ''[[The Matrix]]'' (1999). The style of fighting in the two films bears some resemblance.\n\nIn 1996, an unofficial sequel titled ''Fists of Legends 2: Iron Bodyguards'' was released starring Jet Le (not Jet Li).<ref>{{cite web |title=Jing wu ying xiong 2: Tie bao biao (1996) |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0217493/ |access-date=15 March 2015 |publisher=[[IMDb]]}}</ref>\n\nLater films have also been influenced by ''Fist of Legend''. ''[[Hitman (1998 film)|Hitman]]'' contains a scene involving the main character using a belt as a weapon as seen in ''Fist of Legend''. The more realistic and less [[wire fu|wire-driven]] fight choreography seen in ''[[Kiss of the Dragon]]'' was a result of fan criticism to [[Corey Yuen]]'s choreography in ''[[Romeo Must Die]]'' and preference for the style seen in ''Fist of Legend''.\n\nIn 2006, Jet Li played his character's teacher, [[Huo Yuanjia]], in ''[[Fearless (2006 film)|Fearless]]''.\n\nIn 2010, [[Gordon Chan]] and [[Andrew Lau]] produced a continuation of this film named ''[[Legend of the Fist: The Return of Chen Zhen]]'' with [[Donnie Yen]] as [[Chen Zhen (character)|Chen Zhen]] in his thirties.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Jet Li filmography]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|id=0110200|title=Fist Of Legend}}\n* {{Amg movie|154218|Fist Of Legend}}\n* {{rotten-tomatoes|id=fist_of_legend|title=Fist Of Legend}}\n* [http://www.blackbelttv.com Fist of Legend] at BLACK BELT TV The Martial Arts Network\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20080905072536/http://www.dragondynasty.com/films/show/109 Dragon Dynasty's ''Fist Of Legend'' page]\n([[Wayback Machine]] copy)\n* [http://www.beijingwushuteam.com/articles/fists.html A further examination between the differences of ''Fist Of Fury'' and ''Fist Of Legend'']\n* [http://www.bulletsnbabesdvd.com/forums/viewtopic.php?t=4819 A DVD image comparison between Dimension, Dragon Dynasty and HKVideo]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20120213134947/http://www.kungfucinema.com/reviews/review-fist-of-legend-1994 Kung Fu Cinema's review]\n(Wayback Machine copy)\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20120213135000/http://www.kungfucinema.com/reviews/review-fist-of-legend-dvd-dragon-dynasty Kung Fu Cinema's review of the Dragon Dynasty DVD]\n(Wayback Machine copy)\n* [http://dvdcompare.net/comparisons/film.php?fid=1859 DVD comparison list]\n* [http://www.schnittberichte.com/schnittbericht.php?ID=1062 Pictured differences between the Hong Kong and Taiwanese versions (in German)]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20090921165643/http://www.asiamovies-tvshows.com/480/fist-of-legend/ Fist of Legend Movie Synopsis]\n(Wayback Machine copy)\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20120128173408/http://martiallife.com/index.php/component/content/article/9-martial-arts-movie/63-fist-of-lengend-review-one-of-jet-lis-finest-movie.html Martiallife review of Fist of Legend]\n\n{{Jet Li}}\n{{Gordon Chan}}\n{{Huo Yuanjia and Chen Zhen}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Fist Of Legend}}\n[[Category:1994 films]]\n[[Category:1994 martial arts films]]\n[[Category:1990s Cantonese-language films]]\n[[Category:1990s Hong Kong films]]\n[[Category:1990s Japanese-language films]]\n[[Category:Films about race and ethnicity]]\n[[Category:Films about racism]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Gordon Chan]]\n[[Category:Films set in Japan]]\n[[Category:Films set in Kyoto]]\n[[Category:Films set in Shanghai]]\n[[Category:Golden Harvest films]]\n[[Category:Hong Kong films about revenge]]\n[[Category:Hong Kong martial arts films]]\n[[Category:Jeet Kune Do films]]\n[[Category:Kung fu films]]\n[[Category:Remakes of Hong Kong films]]\n[[Category:Second Sino-Japanese War films]]\n[[Category:Wushu films]]"}]}}}}
