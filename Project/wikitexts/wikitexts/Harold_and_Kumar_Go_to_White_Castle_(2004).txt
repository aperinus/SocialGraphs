The first installment in the [[Harold & Kumar|''Harold & Kumar'' franchise]], the film follows Harold Lee (Cho) and Kumar Patel (Penn) on their adventure to a [[White Castle (restaurant)|White Castle]] restaurant after smoking [[cannabis (drug)|marijuana]].\n\nHurwitz and Schlossberg developed ''Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle'' based on experiences and people from when they attended [[Randolph High School (New Jersey)|Randolph High School]]. The filmmakers received license permission from White Castle in 2002, after also consulting with [[Krispy Kreme]]; White Castle also contributed to the film's marketing campaign, releasing tie-in products at their restaurants. Cho and Harris (who portrays a fictionalized version of himself) were cast early, whereas Penn attended seven auditions. [[Principal photography]] began in 2003, with filming primarily done in [[Toronto]].\n\n''Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle'' was theatrically released in the U.S. on July 30, 2004, by [[New Line Cinema]]. The film received positive critical reception, with praise for the performances of its leads (particularly Harris) and subversion of racial and comedic stereotypes. It was also a commercial success, grossing over $23 million worldwide. The sequel, ''[[Harold & Kumar Escape from Guantanamo Bay]]'', was released internationally in April 2008.\n\n==Plot==\nInvestment banker cubicle worker Harold Lee is pressured by his colleagues to do their work while they leave for the weekend. Meanwhile, his roommate Kumar Patel attends a medical school interview, where he is highly qualified but intentionally botches it to avoid getting accepted. Harold is attracted to his neighbor, Maria, but is unable to admit his feelings. After smoking marijuana and seeing an advertisement for [[White Castle (restaurant)|White Castle]], the pair decide to get its hamburgers. After traveling to the nearest White Castle in [[New Brunswick, New Jersey|New Brunswick]], they find it replaced by \"Burger Shack\". The drive-thru employee informs them of another White Castle in [[Cherry Hill, New Jersey|Cherry Hill]].\n\nKumar suggests stopping at [[Princeton University]] to buy more marijuana. Kumar buys marijuana from one of the students and they are discovered by campus security and forced to flee, losing their marijuana. They resume their drive, and when Kumar pulls over to urinate, a raccoon gets in the car and bites Harold.  Kumar takes Harold to a hospital to check him for rabies; Harold is cleared, but Kumar's father and older brother - who work there as doctors - see them and Kumar's father confronts Kumar over his failed medical interview. Kumar fakes an apology and steals ID badges from them to obtain [[medical cannabis|medical marijuana]]. However, Kumar is then mistaken for his brother by other doctors and is forced to perform emergency surgery on a gunshot victim. To the amazement of Harold and the nurses, Kumar effortlessly saves the patient's life in the nick of time; afterwards, the patient tells them how to reach White Castle.\n\nKumar spots Maria at a movie theater and decides to get her attention so Harold can talk to her, but Harold panics and crashes the car. They are rescued by Freakshow, a tow-truck driver covered with oozing boils, who takes them to his house to repair their car. Harold and Kumar are propositioned by Freakshow's surprisingly alluring wife, but after Freakshow suggests a [[foursome (group sex)|foursome]], Harold and Kumar flee in disgust. Kumar picks up a hitchhiker, [[Neil Patrick Harris]], who is high on [[MDMA|ecstasy]]. Harold and Kumar go into a convenience store to get directions and Harris drives away in their car. The duo are then harassed by a racist police officer for jaywalking. Harold attempts to punch Kumar for antagonizing the officer, but ends up punching the officer instead, resulting in his arrest.\n\nKumar makes a 911 call to distract the police and breaks into the station to free Harold. After Harold and Kumar flee, they encounter an escaped cheetah. After smoking marijuana with it, they decide to ride it to White Castle. Harold hits his head on a branch, destroying his laptop containing all the work that he just completed for his coworkers. Harold and a reluctant Kumar decide to not continue on their trek, but after encountering a group of extreme sports punks who have been harassing the pair, the duo change their mind and steal their truck. A state trooper spots the speeding truck and chases them. They are trapped when they reach the edge of a cliff. Spotting the White Castle below, Harold and Kumar use a hang glider from the truck to reach their destination.\n\nThe pair place their orders but are disheartened to find they have no money. Harris suddenly appears, having craved the food when hearing them talk about it and pays for their meal as an apology for stealing their car; he also further pays for \"repairs\". Kumar realizes he wants to be a doctor, but is afraid of conforming to the stereotype of Indians becoming doctors. Harold then notices his co-workers and two women pull up and gets angry at them because they said they had to work with clients but were actually out partying. He tells them off and threatens to get them fired if it happens again.\n\nAfter returning to their apartment they encounter Maria, Harold professes his feelings for her and they kiss. She informs Harold that she is leaving for [[Amsterdam]], but will return in ten days. When Harold tells Kumar that Maria is going to Amsterdam, Kumar convinces him to go with him to Amsterdam to pursue Maria, reminding him that marijuana is legal in the [[Netherlands]].\n\n==Cast==\n{{Anchor|Cast}}\n{{castlist|\n* [[John Cho]] as Harold Lee, a second-generation [[Korean-Americans|Korean-American]] man working at his first job in [[investment banking]].\n* [[Kal Penn]] as Kumar Patel, a second generation [[Indian American|Indian-American]] whose family thinks that he will become a doctor like his father and brother.\n* [[Paula Garc\u00e9s]] as Maria Perez, Harold and Kumar's neighbor, on whom Harold has a crush.\n* [[Neil Patrick Harris]] as a fictionalized version of himself.\n* [[Ryan Reynolds]] as an OR nurse\n* [[David Krumholtz]] as Goldstein, Harold and Kumar's neighbor and Rosenberg's roommate\n* [[Eddie Kaye Thomas]] as Rosenberg, Harold and Kumar's neighbor and Goldstein's roommate\n* [[Brooke D'Orsay]] as Clarissa, twin sister student at Princeton University who agreed to smoke weed with Kumar\n* [[Kate Kelton]] as Chrissy, twin sister student at Princeton University who agreed to smoke weed with Kumar\n* [[Steve Braun (actor)|Steve Braun]] as Cole, the leader of a recurring gang of five obnoxious [[Extreme sport|extreme-sports]]-obsessed delinquents who often harass the pair or others around them.\n* [[Christopher Meloni]] as Randy/Freakshow, a car mechanic with infected pimples on his face and neck who fixed Harold and Kumar's car\n* Sandy Jobin Bevans as Officer Palumbo, a racist police officer who bullies Harold and Kumar.\n* [[Fred Willard]] as Dr. Willoughby, medical school dean who interviewed Kumar\n* [[Robert Tinkler]] as J.D.\n* [[Anthony Anderson]] as the Burger Shack Employee\n* Albert Howell as Security Guard\n* [[Angelo Tsarouchas]] as Mean Tollbooth Guy\n* [[Jordan Prentice]] as Giant Bag of Weed\n* Siu Ta as Cindy Kim, student at Princeton University who has a crush on Harold\n* [[Bobby Lee]] as Kenneth Park\n* [[Malin \u00c5kerman]] as Liane, Freakshow's wife\n* [[Shaun Majumder]] as Saikat Patel, Kumar's older brother\n* [[Errol Sitahal]] as Dr. Patel, Kumar and Saikat's father\n* [[Dov Tiefenbach]] as Bradley Thomas, student at Princeton University who sold weed to Kumar\n* [[Gary Anthony Williams]] as Tarik Jackson, a philosophical black man who has been arrested for being black\n* [[Boyd Banks]] as E.R.
