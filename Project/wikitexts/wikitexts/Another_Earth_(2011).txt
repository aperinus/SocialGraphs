It premiered at the [[2011 Sundance Film Festival]] in January, and was given a [[limited theatrical release]] on July 22, 2011, by [[Fox Searchlight Pictures]]. The film earned two nominations at the [[38th Saturn Awards]] for Marling's performance and for Cahill and Marling's writing. The critical consensus on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] calls it slow paced but soulful.\n\n==Plot==\nRhoda Williams ([[Brit Marling]]), a brilliant 17-year-old girl who has spent her young life fascinated by astronomy, is delighted to learn that she has been accepted into [[MIT]]. She celebrates, drinking with friends, and in a reckless moment, drives home intoxicated. Listening to a story on the radio about a recently discovered [[Earth]]-like planet, she gazes out her car window at the stars and inadvertently hits a stopped car at an intersection, putting John Burroughs ([[William Mapother]]) in a coma and killing his pregnant wife and young son. After serving her four-year prison sentence, Rhoda becomes a janitor at her former high school and struggles with guilt and regret.\n\nHearing more news stories about the mirror Earth, Rhoda enters an essay contest sponsored by a millionaire entrepreneur who is offering a civilian space flight to the mirror Earth.\n\nOne day Rhoda sees John laying a toy at the accident site. She visits his house, intending to apologize. He answers the door and she loses her nerve. Instead, she pretends to be a maid offering a free day of cleaning as a marketing tool for a cleaning service. John, who has dropped out of his [[Yale]] music faculty position, has been letting his home and himself go, and accepts Rhoda's offer. He has no idea who she is, and when she finishes asks her to come back the next week. In time, a caring relationship develops and they have sex.\n\nRhoda wins the essay contest and is chosen to be one of the first to travel to the other Earth. John asks her not to go, believing they might have a future together. She finally decides to tell him the truth about who she is. He is upset and throws her out of the house.\n\nRhoda hears an [[astrophysics|astrophysicist]] talking on television, describing a \"broken mirror\" hypothesis which states that upon the sighting of the twin-Earth the [[synchronicity]] of events happening in both the earths was broken. Rhoda rushes back to John's house, but he refuses to let her in. She breaks into his house, and he begins to strangle her. He stops, and when she recovers she tells him about the theory and that there might be a possibility for his family to still be alive on the other Earth. She leaves him the ticket. In time, she learns that John accepted the gift and becomes one of the first civilian space travelers to the other Earth.\n\nFour months later, on a foggy day, Rhoda approaches her house, discovering her other self from Earth 2 standing in front of her.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Brit Marling]] as Rhoda Williams\n* [[William Mapother]] as John Burroughs\n* [[Jordan Baker (actor)|Jordan Baker]] as Kim Williams\n* [[Robin Lord Taylor]] as Jeff Williams\n* Flint Beverage as Robert Williams\n* [[Kumar Pallana]] as Purdeep\n* [[Diane Ciesla]] as Dr. Joan Tallis\n* [[Rupert Reid]] as Keith Harding\n* [[Richard Berendzen]] as himself (narrator)<ref>{{cite news|last=Dargis|first=Manohla|title=Living in a Different World, Searching for a Second Chance|url= https://movies.nytimes.com/2011/07/22/movies/another-earth-with-brit-marling-review.html |access-date=July 21, 2011|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|quote=... the filmmakers tapped the astrophysicist Dr. Richard Berendzen ... to provide the mellifluous voice-over that wends through the movie, provocatively speculating on life beyond our planetary horizons, while Rhoda walks alone in a world in which she has become a near alien.|date=July 21, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Taylor|first=Ella|title=Another Chance At Life On 'Another Earth'|url= https://www.npr.org/2011/07/22/138507293/another-chance-at-life-on-another-earth |access-date=July 29, 2011|newspaper=[[NPR]]|date=July 21, 2011|author-link=Ella Taylor|quote=''Another Earth'' is cluttered with unnecessary debris, a philosophizing voice-over from real-life scientist Richard Berendzen and an elderly janitor (Kumar Pallana) who dispenses opaque wisdom every time he opens his mouth.| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110727152441/http://www.npr.org/2011/07/22/138507293/another-chance-at-life-on-another-earth | archive-date= 27 July 2011 | url-status= live}}</ref>\n\n==Production==\nThe idea behind ''Another Earth'' first developed out of director Mike Cahill and actress Brit Marling speculating as to what it would be like were one to encounter one's own self. In order to explore the possibility on a large scale, they devised the concept of a duplicate Earth. The visual representation of the duplicate planet was deliberately made to evoke the Moon, as Cahill was deeply inspired by the 1969 [[Apollo 11]] lunar landing.<ref name=cinedork>{{cite web|last=Soistmann |first=Billy |title=Interview: Mike Cahill discusses &#91;intertwining&#93; science fiction and drama in Another Earth |url=http://cinedork.com/2011/07/25/interview-mike-cahill-discusses-intertwing-science-fiction-and-drama-in-another-earth/ |publisher=Cinedork.com |access-date=July 31, 2011 |date=July 25, 2011 |quote=We started with the bigger concept.

His childhood home was used as Rhoda's home and his bedroom as Rhoda's room. The scene of the car collision was made possible through the help of a local police officer with whom Cahill was acquainted, who cordoned off part of a highway late one night. The scene in which Rhoda leaves the prison facility was filmed by having Marling walk into an actual prison posing as a yoga instructor and then exiting.<ref>{{cite news|last=Smith|first=Abbe|title=Hamden filmmaker returns to his roots|url=http://www.greenwichtime.com/default/article/Hamden-filmmaker-returns-to-his-roots-267347.php|access-date=August 8, 2011|newspaper=[[Greenwich Time (newspaper)|Greenwich Time]]|date=November 26, 2009|location=[[New Haven]]|quote=Scenes were shot at West Haven's high school and police department, a local home, a street in West Haven and dozens of other places in the New Haven area.}}</ref>\n\n{{Anchor|Casting}}\nAccording to Brit Marling, she approached [[William Mapother]] for the role of John after \"being haunted\" by his performance in ''[[In the Bedroom]]'' (2001).
