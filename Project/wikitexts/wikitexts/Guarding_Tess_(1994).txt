MacLaine plays a fictional former [[First Lady of the United States|First Lady]] protected by an entourage of [[United States Secret Service|Secret Service]] agents led by one she continually exasperates (Cage).\n\nThe film is set in [[Somersville, Ohio]] (in reality [[Parkton, Maryland]]<ref>[http://www.epodunk.com/cgi-bin/genInfo.php?locIndex=2723 \"Parkton Community Profile\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170702073303/http://www.epodunk.com/cgi-bin/genInfo.php?locIndex=2723 |date=2017-07-02 }}, ePodunk</ref>) and was nominated for a [[Golden Globe]] award in 1995 (Best Performance by an Actress in a Motion Picture&nbsp;\u2013 Comedy/Musical: Shirley MacLaine).\n\n==Plot==\nDoug Chesnic is a [[United States Secret Service|Secret Service]] agent who takes great pride in his job, performing his duties with the utmost professionalism. His assignment for the last three years has been a severe test of his patience. Doug is in charge of a team stationed in [[Ohio]] to protect Tess Carlisle, the widow of a former U.S. President.\n\nTess is well known for her diplomatic and philanthropic work, but seems to regard Doug less as a security officer and more as a domestic servant\u2014not unlike her chauffeur, Earl, or her nurse, Frederick.\n\nDoug's assignment with Tess comes to an end, so he is eager to be given a more exciting and challenging assignment. Tess decides that she wants him to stay, and Doug's assignment is extended.\n\nDoug regards it as beneath his professional dignity to perform little chores around the house or bring Tess her breakfast in bed. Tess orders him to do so, even to fetch her ball during a round of golf. When Doug defies her, Tess contacts a close friend\u2014the current President of the United States\u2014to express her displeasure. The annoyed President\u2014under the impression Doug is substandard\u2014chastises him by phone.\n\nThe bickering between Doug and Tess continues, even in the car. While alone with Earl, Tess orders him to drive off, stranding her bodyguards. A humiliated Doug must phone the local sheriff\u2014not for the first time\u2014to be on the lookout for her. He fires Earl when they return, but Tess countermands that decision.\n\nAfter returning from a hospital checkup, Tess watches old television footage of her husband's funeral, concentrating on a momentary glimpse of Doug among the mourners, overcome with grief. She makes an effort to get on his good side, sharing a drink and a late-night conversation. She explains that she is not close to her children, in part due to the awkward upbringing they had as a political family. Morale for the agents improves when Tess tells them that the President will be visiting her late husband's presidential library, but his subsequent cancellation lowers her spirits.\n\nDuring a day out, Tess and Earl take off again without Doug on another apparent joy ride. When they don't return that night, Doug and his security detail realize Tess was likely kidnapped and contact the FBI. The FBI's investigation reveals Tess' recent dizzy spells were caused by an inoperable brain tumor (which she had indirectly told Doug about) and eventually, the car is found with an unconscious Earl but no Tess. Earl is found with small crescent-shaped burns on the back of his neck which Doug soon suspects was caused by Tess, fighting back with the car's cigarette lighter.\n\nIn Earl's hospital room, Doug and FBI agent Schaeffer question the chauffeur. He gets nervous and defensive when he sees Doug holding the lighter and attempts to frame him for the kidnapping. Furious, Doug threatens to shoot off the chauffeur's toes, one by one, until he confesses to them where Tess is being held, even going so far as to shoot one toe.<ref>[http://www.script-o-rama.com/movie_scripts/g/guarding-tess-script-transcript-cage.html Guarding Tess Script] Scriporama</ref> Earl admits that Tess is being held captive by his sister and her husband.\n\nThe FBI and Secret Service raid the kidnappers' home and arrest them. When they find Tess buried, but alive, beneath the floor of the farmhouse, Doug and his agents volunteer to do the digging. Tess then insists that her Secret Service detail accompany her to the hospital.\n\nUpon being released from the hospital, Tess refuses to obey the hospital rule that patients must be discharged in a wheelchair. Doug tells her, using her first name for the first time, \"Tess, get in the God damn chair.\" After a brief pause, Tess complies, pats Doug's hand and says, \"Very good, Douglas. You're going to be all right.\"\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Shirley MacLaine]] as First Lady Tess Carlisle\n* [[Nicolas Cage]] as Secret Service Agent Doug Chesnic\n* [[Austin Pendleton]] as Earl Fowler\n* [[Edward Albert]] as Barry Carlisle\n* [[James Rebhorn]] as FBI Agent Howard Schaeffer\n* [[Richard Griffiths]] as Frederick\n* [[John Roselius]] as Secret Service Agent Tom Bahlor\n* [[David Graf]] as Secret Service Agent Lee Danielson\n* Don Yesso as Secret Service Agent Ralph Buoncristiani\n* James Lally as Secret Service Agent Joe Spector\n* Brant von Hoffman as Secret Service Agent Bob Hutcherson\n* [[Harry J.
