Do not add fan fiction. --> is a 2006 [[action film]] directed by [[Justin Lin]] and written by [[Chris Morgan (filmmaker)|Chris Morgan]]. It is the [[standalone sequel]] to ''[[The Fast and the Furious (2001 film)|The Fast and the Furious]]'' (2001) and ''[[2 Fast 2 Furious]]'' (2003) and is the third installment in the ''[[Fast & Furious]]'' franchise. The film stars [[Lucas Black]] and [[Bow Wow (rapper)|Bow Wow]] <!-- PER POSTER BILLING BLOCK --> and follows high school car enthusiast Sean Boswell (Black) who is sent to live in [[Tokyo]] with his estranged father and finds solace exploring the city's [[drifting (motorsport)|drifting]] community.\n\nA third ''Fast & Furious'' film was confirmed in June 2005, when Lin was selected as director. Morgan was hired after an [[open call]] soon after, thus marking the first film in the franchise's longtime association with Lin, Morgan, actor [[Sung Kang]], and composer [[Brian Tyler]].<ref name=\"about.com\">{{cite web |url=http://movies.about.com/od/moviesinproduction/a/fastfurus060805.htm |title=Justin Lin Will Direct \"The Fast and the Furious 3\" |publisher=About.com |access-date=29 July 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130414120607/http://movies.about.com/od/moviesinproduction/a/fastfurus060805.htm |archive-date=14 April 2013 }}</ref> Unable to secure the returns of any of the original cast, development instead increased focus on car culture and [[street racing]].<ref name=\"thr\" /> [[Principal photography]] began in August 2005 and lasted until that November, with filming locations including [[Los Angeles]] and Tokyo, making ''Tokyo Drift'' the first film in the franchise to feature an international filming location.\n\n''The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift'' was released in the United States on June 16, 2006. The film received mixed reviews with praise for its driving sequences, but criticism for its screenplay and acting performances. ''Tokyo Drift'' grossed $159 million worldwide, making it the lowest-grossing film in the franchise. Within the series' continuity, the film is set between ''[[Fast & Furious 6]] '' and ''[[Furious 7]]''.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per [[WP:FILMPLOT]], plot summaries should be between 400 to 700 words. Please check the word count before making any additions. -->\nTroubled [[high school student]] Sean Boswell and athlete Clay race their cars, a 1971 [[Chevrolet Monte Carlo#1971|Chevrolet Monte Carlo]], and a 2003 [[Dodge Viper#Models|Dodge Viper]]. Sean cuts through a structure and catches up to Clay. Desperate to win, Clay hits Sean's car repeatedly until they reach a high-speed turn, which causes both cars to crash; Clay's Viper hits a cement pipe, and Sean's Monte Carlo rolls. Clay's wealthy family helps him escape punishment, but because Sean is a [[repeat offender]], to avoid [[Youth detention|jail]] he is sent to live in Japan with his father, a [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] officer stationed in [[Tokyo]].\n\nIn Tokyo, Sean befriends Twinkie, a [[military brat]] who introduces him to the world of [[Drifting (motorsport)|drift racing]]. After driving to an underground car show in Twinkie's 2005 [[Hulk]]-themed [[Volkswagen Touran]], Sean has a confrontation with Takashi\u2014the Drift King (DK) who drives a 2003 [[Nissan 350Z]]\u2014over Sean talking to Takashi's girlfriend, Neela. Though barred from driving, Sean decides to race against Takashi, who has ties to the [[Yakuza]], in a 1999 [[Nissan Silvia#S15|Nissan Silvia S15 Spec-S]] loaned by a racer named Han, but loses his first race with Takashi due to his unfamiliarity with drifting.\n\nTo repay his debt for the car he destroyed, Sean agrees to work for Han, who drives a 1994 [[Veilside]] Fortune [[Mazda RX-7#FD|Mazda RX-7]]. They become friends, and Han offers to teach Sean how to drift, explaining that he is helping Sean as he is the only person willing to stand up to Takashi. Sean soon masters drifting by practicing in a 2006 [[Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution#Evolution IX|Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution IX]], gaining respect after defeating DK's right-hand man, Morimoto. Sean soon asks Neela out on a date, and learns that after her mother died, she moved in with Takashi's grandmother, which resulted in their relationship. An enraged Takashi beats Sean up the next day, telling him to stay away from Neela; Neela subsequently leaves Takashi and moves in with Sean and Han.\n\nTakashi's uncle Kamata, the head of the [[Yakuza]], reprimands Takashi for allowing Han to steal from him. Takashi and Morimoto confront Han, Sean, and Neela about the thefts. Twinkie causes a distraction, allowing Han, Sean, and Neela to flee, who are then pursued by Takashi and Morimoto. During the chase, Morimoto crashes, leaving Takashi to pursue the trio on his own. Han allows Sean to overtake him to hold Takashi off, but the chase ends when Sean and Neela crash. Meanwhile, moments after escaping, Han's car is [[Side collision#Broadside or T-bone collision|broadsided]] and the car explodes before Sean has a chance to save Han.\n\nTakashi, Sean, and his father become involved in an armed standoff which is resolved by Neela agreeing to leave with Takashi. Sean's father prepares to send him back but Sean pleads him to let him fix his own mess. His father agrees and they make amends. Twinkie gives his money to Sean to replace the money Han stole from Takashi, which Sean then returns to Kamata. Sean proposes a race against Takashi, with the loser having to leave Tokyo. Kamata agrees to the challenge, on the condition that the race take place on the mountain which Takashi himself has been the only person to descend successfully. Sean and Han's crew restore a 1967 [[Ford Mustang (first generation)#1967\u20131968|Ford Mustang Fastback]] that Sean's father was working on to drift specification, using several components of the previously wrecked Silvia, including the engine.\n\nThat night, on the mountain, crowds gather to see the race; Takashi takes the lead initially, but Sean's training allows him to catch up. Takashi repeatedly rams Sean's car, eventually misses, and drives off the mountain while Sean crosses the finish line, with Takashi's car almost falling on him in the process. Kamata keeps his word, and lets Sean remain in Tokyo; Sean is dubbed the new Drift King. Later, Neela, Twinkie, and Sean, now driving a 2001 [[Nissan Silvia#S15|Nissan Silvia S15 Spec R]], are enjoying themselves at another car show. [[Dominic Toretto]] shows up to challenge Sean in a 1970 [[Plymouth Road Runner#1970|Plymouth Road Runner]], and Sean accepts after Dom proclaims himself as Han's family.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Lucas Black]] as [[Sean Boswell]], a young man interested in street racing.\n* [[Bow Wow (rapper)|Bow Wow]] as Twinkie, Sean's first friend he meets in Tokyo and who sells various consumer goods and introduces Sean to drift racing.\n* [[Sung Kang]] as [[Han Lue]], DK's business partner and old friend of Dominic Toretto, who befriends Sean and teaches him how to drift.\n* [[Brian Tee]] as Takashi, Sean's enemy who is acknowledged as the best drift racer and given the title \"Drift King\", or simply \"D.K.\".\n* [[Nathalie Kelley]] as Neela, Takashi's girlfriend who later falls for Sean.\n* [[Sonny Chiba]] (credited as JJ Sonny Chiba) as Kamata, Takashi's uncle who is the head of the Yakuza.\n* [[Leonardo Nam]] as Morimoto, Takashi's right-hand man.\n* [[Brian Goodman]] as Major Boswell, Sean's father.\n* [[Zachery Ty Bryan]] as Clay, the quarterback of Sean's school whom Sean races at the beginning of the film.\n* [[Lynda Boyd]] as Ms. Boswell, Sean's mother who is fed up with moving them around and sends him to [[Tokyo]], [[Japan]] to live with his father.\n* [[Jason Tobin]] as Earl Hu, one of Han's friends who specializes in tuning the cars, along with Reiko.\n* [[Keiko Kitagawa]] as Reiko, Earl's friend and fellow tuner.\n* Nikki Griffin as Cindy, Clay's girlfriend, who suggests that Clay and Sean race to win her.\n* [[Satoshi Tsumabuki]] as Exceedingly Handsome Guy, who starts the first race between Sean and Takashi (cameo)\n* [[Keiichi Tsuchiya]] as an elderly fisherman (uncredited cameo)<ref name=\"bfi\"/>\n* [[Kazutoshi Wadakura]] as an elderly fisherman (uncredited cameo)<ref name=\"bfi\"/>\n* [[Vin Diesel]] as [[Dominic Toretto]] (uncredited cameo)<ref name=\"bfi\"/>\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\n{{quote box\n| align = right\n| width = 35%\n| quote = \"After I'd seen ''[[Better Luck Tomorrow]]'', I knew Justin was a director I wanted to do business with.
