The film was written and directed by [[Frank Darabont]]. Darabont had been interested in adapting ''The Mist'' for the big screen since the 1980s. The film features an [[ensemble cast]], including [[Thomas Jane]], [[Marcia Gay Harden]], [[Nathan Gamble]], [[Andre Braugher]], [[Sam Witwer]], [[Toby Jones]], [[Frances Sternhagen]], [[Buck Taylor]], Robert Treveiler, [[William Sadler (actor)|William Sadler]], [[Alexa Davalos]], David Jensen, [[Chris Owen (actor)|Chris Owen]], [[Andrew Stahl|Andy Stahl]], and future ''[[The Walking Dead (TV series)|The Walking Dead]]'' stars [[Jeffrey DeMunn]], [[Laurie Holden]], [[Melissa McBride]], and [[Juan Gabriel Pareja]].\n\nThe director revised the ending of the film to be darker than the novella's ending, a change to which King was amenable. Darabont also sought unique creature designs to differentiate them from his creatures in past films. Although a [[monster movie]], the central theme explores what ordinary people are driven to do under extraordinary circumstances. The plot revolves around members of the small town of [[Bridgton, Maine]], who after a severe [[thunderstorm]] causes the power to go out the night before, meet in a [[supermarket]] to pick up supplies. While they struggle to survive, an unnatural [[mist]] envelops the town and conceals vicious, [[Lovecraftian horror|Lovecraftian]] monsters as extreme tensions rise among the survivors.\n\nFilming of ''The Mist'' began in [[Shreveport, Louisiana]] in February 2007. The film was released in the United States and Canada on November 21, 2007; it performed well at the box office and received mixed reviews.<ref name=\"Metacritic\"/> \n\nDarabont has since revealed that he had \"always had it in mind to shoot ''The Mist'' in black and white\", a decision inspired by such films as ''[[Night of the Living Dead]]'' (1968) and the pre-color work of [[Ray Harryhausen]]. While the film's theatrical release was in color, the director has described the black-and-white print (released on [[DVD]] and [[Blu-ray]] in 2008) as his \"[[director's cut|preferred version]].\"<ref>{{cite AV media |last=Darabont |first=Frank |title=Director's Introduction |work=The Mist |date=2008 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-64pR2ARecY | archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211117/-64pR2ARecY| archive-date=2021-11-17 | url-status=live|publisher=Harry Knowles |via=[[YouTube]]}}{{cbignore}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nA severe thunderstorm strikes [[Bridgton, Maine]], sending a tree through into the lakeside home of artist David Drayton, his wife Stephanie, and their eight-year-old son Billy. While surveying the damage the next morning, they notice a thick mist advancing over the lake. David and Billy leave for the town with their neighbor Brent Norton to buy supplies.\n\nFrom inside the supermarket, they watch police cars speed down the street. A terrified local, Dan Miller, runs into the store and warns of a danger lurking in the mist. As a civil alert siren sounds, store managers Ollie Weeks and Bud Brown close off the supermarket, and the mist envelops the store. Against David's advice, [[bagger]] Norm starts to go outside to fix the store's emergency generator, but he is grabbed by a tentacled creature and dragged into the mist. David and Ollie direct the customers to barricade the storefront windows, but one woman leaves to go home to her children. Mrs. Carmody, a religious woman, begins preaching about an impending [[Armageddon]], while Brent leaves the store to seek outside help and is killed.\n\nDavid forms connections with several people in the store, including Amanda Dunfrey and Irene Reppler, two teachers who came into conflict with Mrs. Carmody over her religious take on the ongoing disaster. Amanda carries a revolver in her purse and gives it to Ollie, who is a former regional shooting champion. As night falls, enormous flying insects, attracted to the lights, swarm to the store windows and are preyed on by [[pterodactyl]]-like creatures. One of the predators smashes a window, allowing both species inside. In the ensuing panic, Sally and another are killed while Joe receives fatal burns while attempting to incinerate the insects. Meanwhile, Mrs. Carmody is miraculously spared from an insect, which convinces her to [[Proselytism|proselytize]] more fervently and gain followers among the survivors.\n\nA small group led by David goes to the neighboring pharmacy in search of medical supplies but is attacked by giant spiders that kill two men, forcing them to retreat. Mrs. Carmody, who had opposed the expedition on the grounds that it would waste more lives, uses this failure to increase her influence by offering protection from divine wrath to new converts.\n\nThe next day, following the suicides of two soldiers from the local military base, a third soldier, Jessup, reveals that a government project to discover [[Multiverse|other dimensions]] was underway at the base and that scientists accidentally opened a doorway into a dimension that's home to the creatures invading the town. Believing that the monsters would not attack the store as long as they received a \"meal\", Mrs. Carmody's followers offer Jessup as a sacrifice, stabbing him and expelling him from the supermarket, where he is immediately devoured by a giant [[praying mantis]]-like creature.\n\nAs David and his group prepare to leave the store the next morning, they are stopped by Mrs. Carmody. Billy has been chose by her group to be delivered as the next sacrifice to appease the monsters. As the crowd descends on Amanda and Billy, Ollie shoots and kills Mrs. Carmody. The traumatized survivors then allow the group to leave. As the group makes its way through the parking lot, Myron, Ambrose, and Ollie are killed by the spider-creatures from the pharmacy, and Bud runs back to the store. David, Billy, Dan, Amanda, and Irene reach David's car and leave.\n\nDriving through the mist, David finds his home destroyed and Stephanie dead. Devastated, he drives away from town, passing a colossal six-legged beast and eventually running out of gas. With no means of escaping the mist, the adults decide to end their lives. Aiding their suicide, David shoots Billy and the other three survivors with his four remaining bullets before leaving the car to be taken by the creatures. The mist suddenly dissipates, revealing the [[vanguard]] of an [[U.S. Army]] [[Armoured fighting vehicle#Tank|armored]] [[Column (formation)|column]] beginning the process of exterminating the creatures and restoring order. David, seeing that the Army has also rescued survivors, including the woman who left to get to her children, realizes that he killed his son and fellow survivors as they were just moments away from rescue. He drops to his knees, screaming in despair.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Thomas Jane]] as David Drayton, a painter who ends up trapped in the supermarket with his son Billy\n* [[Marcia Gay Harden]] as Mrs. Carmody, a [[religious fanaticism|religious fanatic]] who believes the mist to be the wrath of God\n* [[Laurie Holden]] as Amanda Dunfrey, a new teacher at the local school.

Darabont conceived of a new ending in translating the novella for the big screen. Author King praised Darabont's new ending, describing it as one that would be unsettling for studios. King said, \"The ending is such a jolt\u2014wham! It's frightening. But people who go to see a horror movie don't necessarily want to be sent out with a [[Pollyanna]] ending.\"<ref>{{cite news |first=Anthony |last=Breznican |url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/movies/news/2007-06-20-stephen-king-movies_N.htm |title=Stephen King adapts to Hollywood |newspaper=[[USA Today]] |date=2007-06-20 |access-date=2007-11-19}}</ref>\n\nDarabont described ''The Mist'' as quaint in its elements of monsters and fear of the unknown compared to the contemporary popularity of films with [[torture porn]]. The director saw ''The Mist'' as a throwback to [[Paddy Chayefsky]] and [[William Shakespeare]], explaining, \"It's people at each other.\" He highlighted the element of fear in the film in how it compelled people to behave differently. Darabont said, \"How primitive do people get? It's ''[[Lord of the Flies]]'' that happens to have some cool monsters in it.\"<ref name=sdcc /> He also drew parallels to ''[[The Twilight Zone (1959 TV series)|The Twilight Zone]]'' episode \"[[The Monsters Are Due on Maple Street]]\" and the 1944 film ''[[Lifeboat (1944 film)|Lifeboat]]''.<ref name=shock/>\n\nIn the novella, the character David Drayton\u2014who is married\u2014has a sexual encounter with Amanda Dumfries, who is also married. Darabont did not want to attempt conveying on screen the protagonist being involved in an extramarital affair. The characters in the film, portrayed by Thomas Jane and Laurie Holden, instead share a more emotional relationship. Jane explained, \"We kind of form a little family, sort of surrogate family where my son and I'm a father and she becomes the mother to the son. We become a little unit as we're trying to get through this nightmare together.\" Holden compared the nightmare to [[Effect of Hurricane Katrina on the Louisiana Superdome|what refugees experienced]] at the [[Louisiana Superdome]] during [[Hurricane Katrina]].<ref name=about/>\n\nWhile the origin of the mist in the film is never explained in great detail, Frank Darabont did write an opening scene in a draft dated 5 August 2005, in which the thunderstorm causes a malfunction at the Arrowhead Project's lab that allows the portal to another dimension to stay open too long. The scene was never filmed.\n\n===Production===\nIn December 2006, Jane finalized negotiations with the studio to join the cast.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://movies.ign.com/articles/749/749742p1.html |title=The Punisher Enters The Mist |website=[[IGN]] |date=2006-12-06 |access-date=2007-05-17}}</ref> In January 2007, actors [[Andre Braugher]] and [[Laurie Holden]] joined Jane for the cast of ''The Mist''.<ref name=\"float\">{{cite news |first=Borys |last=Kit |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/search/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003538158 |title=Braugher, Holden float to 'Mist' |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |date=2007-01-26 |access-date=2007-05-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070217054105/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/search/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003538158 |archive-date=2007-02-17 |url-status=dead}}</ref> Production began the following February at StageWorks of Louisiana, a sound stage and film production facility in [[Shreveport, Louisiana]].<ref>{{cite news |first=Alexandyr |last=Kent |title='The Mist' creeping into Shreveport |newspaper=[[The Times (Shreveport)|The Times]] |date=2007-01-19}}</ref> [[Marcia Gay Harden]] and [[Toby Jones]] joined the cast later in the month.<ref>{{cite magazine |date=2007-02-21 |first=Michael |last=Fleming |url=https://variety.com/2007/film/markets-festivals/actors-will-emerge-from-king-s-mist-2-1117959912/ |title=Actors will emerge from King's 'Mist' |magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |access-date=2019-08-11}}</ref>\n\n[[William Sadler (actor)|William Sadler]], Jeffrey DeMunn, and Brian Libby, each of whom appeared in Darabont's previous Stephen King adaptations ''The Shawshank Redemption'' and ''The Green Mile'', were cast in supporting roles.

Darabont wanted to cast King in the supporting role that eventually went to Brian Libby, an offer that King turned down because he did not want to travel to film the part''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.movieweb.com/news/97/24397.php |title=INTERVIEW: Stephen King and Director Frank Darabont Talk The Mist |date=November 13, 2007 |website=Movieweb.com |access-date=2008-02-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080216181705/http://www.movieweb.com/news/97/24397.php |archive-date=2008-02-16 |url-status=dead}}</ref>''\n\nDarabont sought to pursue \"a more fluid, ragged [[Documentary film|documentary]] kind of direction\" with ''The Mist'',<ref name=about/> so he contacted the camera crew from the television series ''[[The Shield]]'', after having directed one episode, to use their style in the film.<ref name=con>{{cite news |first=Edward |last=Douglas |url=http://www.shocktillyoudrop.com/news/comicconnews.php?id=903 |title=Comic-Con '07: Two Clips From ''The Mist''! |website=ShockTillYouDrop.com |date=2007-07-27 |access-date=2007-07-30 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716061433/http://www.shocktillyoudrop.com/news/comicconnews.php?id=903 |archive-date=2011-07-16}}</ref> Darabont attempted to film ''The Mist'' [[digital cinematography|digitally]] but found that it \"wound up looking too beautiful\". He instead chose to film with 400 ASA from [[Fujifilm]], which gave footage a [[film grain|grainy effect]].<ref name=\"shock\" />\n\nIn the opening shot, David is seen finishing a painting based on King's ''[[The Dark Tower (series)|Dark Tower]]'' series, and was painted by film poster designer [[Drew Struzan]]. Darabont also included reproductions of Struzan's posters and illustrations for ''The Shawshank Redemption'', ''The Green Mile'', [[John Carpenter]]'s ''[[The Thing (1982 film)|The Thing]]'', and [[Guillermo del Toro]]'s ''[[Pan's Labyrinth]]''. Struzan went on to produce a poster for ''The Mist'', but this image was not used in the film's marketing campaign.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.drewstruzan.com/illustrated/documents/img/gl0812090739458973.jpg |title=Poster for \"The Mist\" |first=Drew |last=Struzan |date=2007 |website=drewstruzan.com}}</ref>\n\nDarabont collaborated with the production designer to create a mix of eras to avoid appearing as a [[period piece]], but also not looking so contemporary. Cell phones were used by characters in ''The Mist'', but the [[military police]] in the film did not dress in modern attire. While an MP drives an old [[Jeep]] instead of a [[Humvee]], other cars seen in the film are modern models.<ref name=shock/> The city police cars in the beginning of the film are a 1987 [[Chevrolet Caprice]] and a 1988 [[Ford LTD Crown Victoria]], cars that were standard police vehicles in the late 1980s, but have not been used in force since the late 1990s.\n\nOver 100 [[Extra (actor)|extra]]s from Shreveport, Louisiana, were used in ''The Mist''. Unlike conventional application of extras in the background of a film, 60 extras were interwoven with the film's ensemble cast.<ref>{{cite news |first=Alexandyr |last=Kent |url=http://www.shreveporttimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20071118/LIVING/711150360/1004/LIVING |title=The core of a horror flick: 'The Mist' features dozens of local extras |newspaper=[[The Times (Shreveport)|The Times]] |date=2007-11-18 |access-date=2007-11-20 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080112003210/http://www.shreveporttimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F20071118%2FLIVING%2F711150360%2F1004%2FLIVING |archive-date=January 12, 2008}}</ref> Additional elements giving the film a local flavor include the prominence of local Louisiana brands such as Zapp's potato chips. Exterior shots of the house at the beginning were in Shreveport. Exterior shots of the supermarket were in [[Vivian, Louisiana]]. Shields on the  passing firetrucks early in the film identify them as part of the [[Caddo Parish]] fire department.\n\n===Music===\nDarabont chose to use music to minimal effect in ''The Mist'' to capture the \"heavier feel\" of the darker ending he had written to replace the one from the novella. The director explained, \"Sometimes movie music feels false. I've always felt that silent can be scarier than loud, a whisper more frightening than a bang, and we wanted to create a balance. We kept music to a minimum to keep that ''v\u00e9rit\u00e9'', documentary feel.\" Darabont chose to overlay the song \"The Host of Seraphim\" by the band [[Dead Can Dance]], a spiritual piece characterized by wailing and chanting. As a fan of Dead Can Dance, Darabont thought that the song played \"as a [[requiem mass]] for the human race.\"<ref>{{cite news |first=David |last=Frese |url=http://www.kansascity.com/entertainment/story/362931.html |title=Frank Darabont dares to alter a Stephen King classic: 'The Mist' |newspaper=[[Kansas City Star]] |date=2007-11-17 |access-date=2007-11-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071121023627/http://www.kansascity.com/entertainment/story/362931.html |archive-date=2007-11-21 |url-status=dead}}</ref><!-- archive copy seems to be invalid --> The original score was composed by Academy Award-nominated composer [[Mark Isham]].\n\n===Effects===\nDarabont hired artists [[Jordu Schell]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://atthamovies.com/the-most-realistic-grand-moff-tarkin-bust-ever-made/ |title=The Most Realistic Grand Moff Tarkin Bust Ever Made |website=At Tha Movies |date=2014-01-27 |access-date=2014-01-27}}</ref> and [[Bernie Wrightson]] to assist in designing the creatures for the film.<ref name=con /> [[Greg Nicotero]] worked on the film's creature design and make-up effects, while Everett Burrell served as the visual effects supervisor.

When the project was greenlit, Nicotero, Burrell, and Darabont collaborated on the creature design at round-table meetings at Caf\u00e9FX.<ref name=about/> The studio for visual effects had been recommended to Darabont by Guillermo del Toro after Darabont asked the director who created the visual effects for ''Pan's Labyrinth''.\n\nBecause the creatures were described in only a few sentences in the novella, Darabont sought to create new designs, but specifically designs which felt unique.
