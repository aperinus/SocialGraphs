The film features [[Katie Featherston]], who starred in the first film, and had cameos in the other two. The film was released in theaters and [[IMAX]] on October 17, 2012, in the United Kingdom and was released on October 19, 2012, in the United States, by [[Paramount Pictures]]. It is the fourth installment in the [[Paranormal Activity (film series)|''Paranormal Activity'' series]], and a sequel to ''[[Paranormal Activity 2]]'', set several years later.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- On May 5, 2021, this plot section was reduced from 696 to 422 words. Per WP:FILMPLOT, you must keep plot sections between 400 to 700 words and concise so that they're not just a sequence of all the film's events. -->\nOn October 9, 2006, Kristi Rey and her husband Daniel were killed by her demon-possessed sister Katie, who then abducts Kristi's one-year-old son, Hunter. The police are still unable to find Katie and Hunter. In November 2011, Alex Nelson is living in a wealthy suburb of [[Henderson, Nevada]] with her father Doug, mother Holly, and little brother Wyatt. Alex records footage with a laptop [[webcam]] before Alex and her best friend Ben set up cameras all over the house after many strange occurrences, which escalate into several cars parked outside a neighbor's house, and objects such as chandeliers, kitchen knives, the family car, and garage doors becoming sentient.\n\nThe neighbor has a son, Robbie, who stays at the Nelsons' home while his mother is hospitalized. Wyatt tells Alex about Robbie's [[imaginary friend]] Toby,<ref>{{cite web |title=Paranormal Activity 4 (2012) Movie Script |url=https://www.springfieldspringfield.co.uk/movie_script.php?movie=paranormal-activity-4 |website=Springfield! Springfield! |access-date=October 28, 2019}}</ref> and Alex finds Robbie in a closet saying \"He doesn't like you watching us\". Wyatt also tells Alex and Ben about meeting \"him\", revealing a green symbol on his back identical to an ancient [[Hittites|Hittite]] symbol, one that would prepare a victim for [[demonic possession]]. They learn that the possession ritual requires a [[Virginity|virgin]] [[human sacrifice|blood sacrifice]]. It is then revealed than Robbie's mother is actually Katie. Wyatt is told by her that he and Robbie were adopted and that his other family needs him back. He argues with an unseen, unheard presence about his real name, declaring, \"I'm not Hunter!\". As the month progresses, there are even more odd activities, such as Wyatt going in a [[trance]] and levitating Alex. One night, a possessed Katie sneaks into the house and tells Wyatt she'll wait until he is \"ready\". Alex tries to show her parents the footage, but it has been mysteriously erased.\n\nThe next night, while Doug and Alex are at a dinner, two deaths occur at the home. Holly is violently thrown against the ceiling, and Ben, visiting the home to inform Alex about the symbol's relation to a [[witch|coven]], has his neck twisted by Katie. Alex and Doug arrive home and Doug goes next door, believing he saw Holly and Wyatt. Alex finds Ben's body and is suddenly knocked down by a force. She flees to Katie's home and finds Doug being dragged out of sight. She searches for him when she hears Wyatt's voice, before a demonic Katie runs towards her. Alex escapes from Katie by jumping through a window into the yard, where she finds Wyatt and dozens of women walking towards her. Katie lunges at her, the camera falls to the ground and the footage is cut off.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Kathryn Newton]] as Alex Nelson\n* [[Matt Shively]] as Ben\n* Aiden Lovekamp as Wyatt Nelson / Hunter Rey\n* Brady Allen as Robbie\n* [[Stephen Dunham]] as Doug Nelson\n* [[Alexondra Lee]] as Holly Nelson\n* [[Katie Featherston]] as Katie\n* [[Alisha Boe]] as Tara\n* [[Frank Welker]] as Vocal Effects / Tobi\n\n==Production==\nA fourth ''Paranormal Activity'' film was first hinted by Paramount domestic distribution head Don Harris in an interview with ''[[TheWrap]]'' published on October 23, 2011, two days after the United-States-wide release of the [[Paranormal Activity 3|third film]]. As of that day, [[Paranormal Activity (film series)|the entire franchise]] grossed $450 million on a budget of $8,015,000, the third movie grossing $54 million.
