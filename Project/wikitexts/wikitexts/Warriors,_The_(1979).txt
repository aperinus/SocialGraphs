Based on [[Sol Yurick]]'s [[The Warriors (Yurick novel)|1965 novel of the same name]], it was released in the United States in February 1979. The film centers on a fictitious [[New York City]] street gang who must travel {{convert|30|mi}}, from the north end of [[the Bronx]] to their home turf in [[Coney Island]] in southern Brooklyn, after they are framed for the murder of a respected gang leader.\n\nAfter reports of vandalism and violence, Paramount temporarily halted their advertising campaign and released theater owners from their obligation to show the film. Despite its initially negative reception, ''The Warriors'' has since become a [[cult film]] and has been reappraised by film critics. The film has spawned several spinoffs, including video games and a comic book series.\n\nIn his book about the film, author Sean Egan summarized its appeal: \"Whereas the milieu of ''The Warriors'' was one normally only depicted in motion pictures as an examination of a social problem, this movie portrayed life from the street gang\u2019s point of view. It was an obvious but revolutionary approach that struck a chord with the urban working class, especially its adolescent subset.\"<ref>Egan, Sean. ''Can You Dig It: The Phenomenon of The Warriors. BearManor Media, 2021, p. 2.</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nCyrus, leader of the [[Gramercy Park|Gramercy]] Riffs, the most powerful gang in New York City, requests that each of the city\u2019s gangs send nine unarmed delegates to [[Van Cortlandt Park]] for a midnight summit. The Warriors, a gang from [[Coney Island]], attend the summit. Cyrus proposes to the assembled crowd a citywide truce and alliance that would allow the gangs to control the city together, since they collectively outnumber the police by three to one.\n\nMost of the gang members applaud this idea, but Luther, the unbalanced and sadistic leader of the Rogues, shoots Cyrus dead as police officers arrive to raid the summit. In the ensuing chaos, Luther realizes that one of the Warriors, Fox, appears to suspect him, and makes a [[false accusation]] which leads the vengeful Riffs to attack the \"Warlord\", Cleon. Meanwhile, the other Warriors escape, unaware that they have been implicated in Cyrus's killing. The Riffs put out a hit on the Warriors through a radio [[Disc jockey|DJ]]. Swan, the \"War Chief,\" takes charge of the group as they try get home, though the Warriors's main enforcer and brawler Ajax disagrees with Swan being leader over him.\n\nThe Turnbull ACs spot the Warriors and try to run them down with a modified [[school bus]] but the Warriors escape and board an [[MTA New York City Subway|elevated train]]. On the ride to Coney Island, the train is stopped by a building fire alongside the tracks, stranding the Warriors in [[Tremont, Bronx|Tremont]]. Setting out on foot, they encounter the Orphans, who are insecure about their low status in the gang hierarchy as they were excluded from Cyrus's meeting. After Mercy, the girlfriend of the Orphans' leader, instigates a confrontation, Swan throws a [[Molotov cocktail]] and the Warriors run to the nearest subway station. Impressed and desperate to escape her depressed neighborhood, Mercy follows the Warriors.\n\nWhen the group arrives at the [[96th Street station (IRT Broadway\u2013Seventh Avenue Line)|96th Street and Broadway]] station in Manhattan, they are pursued by police and separated. Three of them, Vermin, Cochise and Rembrandt, escape by boarding a subway car. Fox, struggling with a police officer, is thrown onto the tracks and is fatally hit by a passing train as Mercy flees the scene. Swan, Ajax, Snow and Cowboy are chased by the Baseball Furies into [[Riverside Park (Manhattan)|Riverside Park]] but defeat them in a brawl. After the fight, Ajax sees a lone woman sitting on a park bench and leaves the group despite Swan's objections. When Ajax becomes sexually aggressive, the woman, revealed to be an undercover police officer, handcuffs him to the bench and arrests him.\n\nUpon arriving at [[14th Street\u2013Union Square station|Union Square]], Vermin, Cochise and Rembrandt are seduced by an all-female gang called the Lizzies and invited into their hideout. They narrowly escape the Lizzies' subsequent attack, learning in the process that the gangland community believes the Warriors murdered Cyrus. Acting as a lone scout, Swan decides to return to the 96th Street station, where Mercy joins him (although he spurns her promiscuity). After reaching the Union Square station, they reunite with the remaining Warriors and engage in a fight with a [[roller skates|roller-skating]] gang, the Punks. Mercy proves herself formidable in combat. A member of a different gang visits the Riffs and tells them that he saw Luther shoot Cyrus.\n\nAt dawn, the Warriors finally reach Coney Island, only to find Luther and the Rogues waiting for them. Swan challenges Luther to single combat but Luther pulls a gun. Swan dodges his shot and throws a [[switchblade]] (taken from one of the Punks) into Luther's wrist, disarming him. The Riffs arrive, acknowledging the Warriors' courage and skill before apprehending the Rogues. As the Riffs descend upon him, Luther screams. The radio DJ announces that \"the big alert has been called off\" and salutes the Warriors with a song, \"[[In the City (Joe Walsh song)|In the City]].\" The film ends with Swan, Mercy and the rest of the gang walking down a Coney Island beach, illuminated by the rising sun.\n\n==Cast==\n<!--- Cast and order per opening tombstone credits, roles per closing credits scroll, adjustments as footnoted --->\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Michael Beck]] as Swan\n* [[James Remar]] as Ajax\n* [[Deborah Van Valkenburgh]] as Mercy\n* [[Marcelino S\u00e1nchez]] as Rembrandt\n* [[David Harris (American actor)|David Harris]] as Cochise\n* Tom McKitterick as Cowboy\n* Brian Tyler as Snow\n* [[Dorsey Wright]] as Cleon\n* [[Terry Michos]] as Vermin\n* [[David Patrick Kelly]] as Luther\n* [[Roger Hill (actor)|Roger Hill]] as Cyrus\n* Edward Sewer as Masai{{refn|name=SewerCredits|group=N|The credits incorrectly identify Gregory as Masai and Sewer as an unnamed Gramercy Riff.}}\n* [[Lynne Thigpen]] as the D.J.\n* [[Thomas G.

Gordon had made ''Hard Times'' (1975) and ''The Driver'' (1978) with Walter Hill; he sent the script to Hill with a copy of Sol Yurick's novel. Hill recalls, \"I said 'Larry, I would love to do this, but nobody will let us do it.' It was going to be too extreme and too weird.\"<ref name=\"hill5\">[http://www.dga.org/Craft/VisualHistory/Interviews/Walter-Hill.aspx?Filter=Full+Interview \"Interview with Walter Hill \u2013 Chapter 5\" ''Directors Guild of America''] accessed June 12, 2014</ref><ref name=\"ducker\">{{Cite news\n | last = Ducker\n | first = Eric\n | title = New York Mythology\n | work = Fader\n | date = October 3, 2005\n | url = http://www.thefader.com/blog/articles/2005/10/03/new-york-mythology\n | access-date = September 28, 2008 }}</ref>\n\nGordon and Hill were originally going to make a western but when the financing on the project failed to materialize, they took ''The Warriors'' to [[Paramount Pictures]] because they were interested in youth films at the time and succeeded in getting the project financed. Hill remembers \"it came together very quickly. Larry had a special relationship with Paramount and we promised to make the movie very cheaply, which we did. So it came together within a matter of weeks. I think we got the green light in April or May 1978 and we were in theaters in February 1979. So it was a very accelerated process.\"<ref name=\"esquire\"/>\n\nHill was drawn to the \"extreme narrative simplicity and stripped down quality of the script\".<ref name=\"ducker\"/> The script, as written, was a realistic take on street gangs but Hill was a huge fan of comic books and wanted to divide the film into chapters and then have each chapter \"come to life starting with a splash panel\".<ref name=\"ducker\"/> However, Hill was working on a low budget and a tight post-production schedule because of a fixed release date as the studio wanted to release ''The Warriors'' before a rival gang picture called ''[[The Wanderers (1979 film)|The Wanderers]]''. Hill was finally able to include this type of scene transition in the Ultimate Director's Cut released for home video in 2005.<ref name=\"ducker\"/>\n\n===Casting===\nThe filmmakers did extensive casting in New York City.<ref name=\"ducker\"/> Hill was considering hiring [[Sigourney Weaver]] from ''[[Alien (film)|Alien]]'' and watched a movie she'd filmed in [[Israel]] called ''Madman'' where the male lead opposite Weaver was played by Michael Beck. The director was impressed with Beck's performance and cast him in ''The Warriors''. Hill initially wanted a Puerto Rican actress for the role of Mercy, but Deborah Van Valkenburgh's agent convinced the film's casting directors to see her and she was eventually cast. The filmmakers wanted to cast [[Tony Danza]] in the role of Vermin but he was cast in the sitcom ''[[Taxi (TV series)|Taxi]]'' and Terry Michos was cast instead. While there were white characters in Yurick's book, none of the central characters or protagonists were white: according to Hill, Paramount did not want an all-black cast for \"commercial reasons\".<ref name=\"ducker\"/>\n\nWalter Hill saw [[Thomas G. Waites]] as the next James Dean and the director \"invited the young actor to the Gulf and Western to watch movies like ''[[Rebel Without a Cause]]'' and ''[[East of Eden (film)|East of Eden]]'' for inspiration.\"<ref name=Remember>{{cite news |last=Connor |first=Jackson |title=Remember the Warriors: Behind the Chaotic, Drug-Fueled, and Often Terrifying Making of a Cult Classic |url=http://www.villagevoice.com/news/remember-the-warriors-behind-the-chaotic-drug-fueled-and-often-terrifying-making-of-a-cult-classic-7607043 |newspaper=[[The Village Voice]] |date=September 8, 2015 |access-date=April 2, 2018}}</ref> During the screening, Hill offered Waites a drink, which Waites refused, resulting in a rift between the two that grew worse during the grueling summer shoot. At one point, Waites threatened to report the working conditions to the [[Screen Actors Guild]], forcing [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]] to provide a second trailer for the eight Warriors to share.<ref name=Remember/>\n\nFinally, after eight weeks into principal photography, when the tension on set between Waites and Hill reached the breaking point, Hill demanded that stunt coordinator Craig Baxley improvise a stunt scene in which Waites' character would be killed. \"Stunned, Baxley demurred. Such a critical scene would take careful planning. But Hill was insistent. 'I don't give a shit how you kill him,' Baxley recalls the director saying. 'Kill him.'\" Baxley found a crew member who resembled Waites and staged a scene in which the character is thrown off a subway platform in front of an approaching train. \"It was like someone cut my soul out and left a shell\", Waites remembers. He would later demand that his name be removed from the cast altogether; he remains uncredited to this day.<ref name=Remember/>\n\n===Filming===\n[[File:Coney Island beach and amusement parks (June 2016).jpg|thumb|Scenes from the film were shot in Coney Island (pictured in 2016)]]\nStunt coordinator [[Craig R. Baxley]] put the cast through stunt school because Hill wanted realistic fights depicted in the film.<ref name=\"ducker\"/> In preparation for his role, [[James Remar]] hung out at Coney Island to find a model for his character. The entire film was shot on the streets in New York City with some interior scenes done at [[Astoria Studios]]. They would shoot from sundown to sunrise. The film quickly fell behind schedule and went over budget. Although The Conclave scene at the beginning was supposed to be in The Bronx. It was actually filmed in Riverside Park in Manhattan. Other than the Bathroom Fight scene against The Punks being shot in a Studio. The entire Movie was only filmed in Manhattan, Brooklyn & Queens. Actor Joel Weiss remembers that filming of his scene on [[Avenue A (Manhattan)|Avenue A]], in Manhattan's notorious [[Alphabet City, Manhattan#20th century|Alphabet City]], was canceled because there was a double homicide nearby. For the big meeting at the beginning of the film, Hill wanted real gang members in the scene with off duty police officers also in the crowd so that there would be no trouble.<ref name=\"ducker\"/>\n\nThe studio would not allow Baxley to bring any stunt men from [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] and he needed someone to double for the character of Cyrus so he did the stunt himself dressed as the character.<ref name=\"ducker\"/> Actual gang members wanted to challenge some of the cast members but were dealt with by production security. The actors playing The Warriors bonded early in the shoot, on and off the set. Originally, the character of Fox was supposed to end up with Mercy, while Swan was captured by a rival, homosexual gang known as the Dingos, only to escape later. However, Hill watched the dailies and realized that Beck and Van Valkenburgh had great chemistry; the script was rewritten so that their characters ended up together.<ref name=\"ducker\"/>\n\nThe Rogues' car in the Coney Island confrontation was a 1955 Cadillac [[hearse]].<ref>{{cite web |author=Time to create page: 0.196 seconds |url=http://www.v8tvshow.com/forum/index.php?action=printpage;topic=9768.0 |title=V8tvshow.com |publisher=V8tvshow.com |access-date=January 26, 2015 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140103135431/http://www.v8tvshow.com/forum/index.php?action=printpage;topic=9768.0 |archive-date=January 3, 2014 }}</ref> Originally, at the Coney Island confrontation at the end of the film, actor [[David Patrick Kelly]] wanted to use two dead pigeons but Hill did not think that would work.<ref name=\"ducker\"/> Instead, Kelly improvised by clinking three bottles in his right hand and ad-libbing his famous line, \"Waaaaarriors, come out to plaaaay\". Kelly was influenced by a man he knew in downtown New York who would make fun of him.\n\nHill wanted [[Orson Welles]] to do a narrated introduction about [[Ten Thousand|Greek themes]] but the studio did not like this idea and refused to pay for it.<ref name=\"ducker\"/> However, this sequence was finally included in the 2005 Ultimate Director's Cut, with Hill providing the narration himself. \"I wanted to take it into a fantasy element, but at the same time add some contemporary flash\", said Hill. \"Those were some of the hard ideas we had to get the studio to understand. But we did not get along very well with our parent company. After the movie came out and it did well, everybody was sort of friends. But up until then there was a lot of misunderstanding.

Presented them as a neutral or positive aspect of their lives. As soon as you said in the old days gang movies it was how do we cure the pestilence and how do we fix the social waste. We want to take these kids, make sure they go to college... This was just a movie that conceptually was different. Accepted the idea of the gang, didn't question it, that was their lives, they functioned within that context. And the social problem wasn't were they going to college, but were they going to survive. It's the great Hawksian dictum, where is the drama? Will he live or die? That's the drama.<ref name=\"hill5\"/></blockquote>\n\n\"Hollywood forgives a lot when you have a hit,\" he added. \"I don't know what to say about it, other than the fact that it was just a gift in terms of getting it.
