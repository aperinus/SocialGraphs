Each box plays a subtly different version of \"The Swagman\". At the auction each is purchased by a different buyer.\n\n[[Dr. Watson]]'s friend Julian Emery, a music box collector, pays him and [[Sherlock Holmes]] a visit and tells them of an attempted burglary in his house the previous night of a plain cheap box (similar to the one he bought at auction) while leaving other much more valuable ones. Holmes and Watson ask to see and are shown Emery's collection. After they leave, Emery welcomes a female acquaintance, Hilda Courtney, who tries unsuccessfully to buy the auctioned box; when he declines, a male friend of Courtney's who has sneaked in murders Emery.\n\nAt this murder Holmes becomes even more curious and learns to whom else the boxes were auctioned off. Holmes and Watson arrive at the house of the person who bought the second one, just as a strange maid (Courtney in disguise) is on her way \"to go shopping\"; they later realize it was not a maid, she locked a child in a closet in order to steal the box from the child.\n\nHolmes is able to buy the third box, and upon examination, discovers that its variant musical notes' numbers correlate to letters of the alphabet. Scotland Yard fills him in on the stolen bank plates to which the music boxes connect, but all three are needed to decipher the message.\n\nBack at home, the flat is found ransacked, and a cigarette with a distinct type of tobacco is the sole clue. Holmes tracks down the woman who bought the tobacco, Courtney.\n\nWhile confronting her, Holmes is ambushed by her accomplices, handcuffed, taken to a warehouse, hung by a rafter, and left with poison gas filling the room. While Holmes is narrowly escaping death, Courtney steals the box from Watson.\n\nHolmes manages to make it back in one piece and while conversing, Watson offhandedly mentions a quote from [[Samuel Johnson|Dr. Samuel Johnson]]. Thinking about this quote, Holmes makes a connection as to where the stolen plates may be hidden.\n\nHaving stolen all the boxes and deciphered their message, Courtney and gang join a tour group at Dr. Samuel Johnson's house, now a museum, where they slip away and find the plates hidden within a bookshelf. Courtney is stealing the plates when Holmes ambushes the group. Scotland Yard officers arrest them, and the plates are returned to the bank.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Basil Rathbone]] as [[Sherlock Holmes]]\n* [[Nigel Bruce]] as [[Dr. Watson|Dr. John H.
