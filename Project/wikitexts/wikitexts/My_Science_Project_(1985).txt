Betuel. It followed on heels of other teen sci-fi/comedy films released the same year, such as ''[[Back to the Future]]'', ''[[Real Genius]]'', and ''[[Weird Science (film)|Weird Science]]'', though it did not perform as well as those films.\n\n== Plot ==\nIn 1957, the [[Military of the United States|United States military]] secures a crashed [[Unidentified flying object|UFO]] in a hangar bay. President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] (Robert Beer) enters to see the craft and simply orders his men to \"get rid of it\".\n\nIn 1985, a high school senior named Michael Harlan ([[John Stockwell (actor)|John Stockwell]]), whose only interest is [[muscle car]]s, reluctantly searches for something to turn in for his science class project final. While on what his [[Bibliophilia|bookworm]] friend Ellie Sawyer ([[Danielle von Zerneck]]) thinks is a date, Michael breaks into a government [[aircraft boneyard]] and stumbles upon a hidden [[fallout shelter]]. There, he finds a glowing, [[plasma globe]]-like piece of scientific equipment and grabs it just as a military guard approaches and chases him away.\n\nThe next day, Michael cleans up the device in auto shop class and unwittingly activates it, causing it to leech power from a nearby [[boombox]]. His friend, Vince Latello ([[Fisher Stevens]]), tries to talk him out of attaching the device to an [[automotive battery]], whereupon the device emits a swirl of colorful energy that manifests into an [[Ancient Greek]] vase as the battery melts. The two leave the auto shop for their next class, but soon realize they inexplicably lost two hours of time and missed their final science exam.\n\nAfter more strange occurrences with the machine, Michael takes the device, referred to as \"the gizmo\", to his ex-[[hippie]] science teacher Dr. Roberts ([[Dennis Hopper]]). Believing it is a portal to another dimension, he plugs it into an electrical outlet. While bathing in the cosmic energy of the gizmo and contemplating the wonders of the universe, Roberts suddenly disappears, leaving behind his [[Peace symbols|peace symbol]] medallion. Michael is unable to disconnect the machine from the outlet and decides his only solution is to destroy the [[Electric power transmission|power lines]] leading to town.\n\nMichael and Vince obtain [[dynamite]] from the backroom of a hardware store owned by Michael's father ([[Barry Corbin]]), and race to outrun a wave of energy traveling along the lines before it reaches the local power plant. They blow up a tower, stopping the wave and causing a blackout, but upon returning to town are arrested for Dr. Roberts' disappearance. Michael calls Ellie and asks her to go to the school to retrieve the gizmo, hoping to prove his innocence by showing it to the police. At the school, she runs into Sherman ([[Raphael Sbarge]]), an obnoxious nerd, who hooks the gizmo up to the outlet again, creating a massive time warp over the school and causing a blackout in town, allowing Vince and Michael to escape the police. Returning to the school, they find the whole building consumed in a vortex of space/time as objects and people from the past and future manifest around them and a crazed Sherman, who fears the world is ending and tells them that Ellie is in danger.\n\nDragging Sherman along, Mike and Vince grab weapons from a platoon of fallen [[Vietnam War]] soldiers and make their way to the science lab, battling a [[Tyrannosaurus|T-rex]] in the gymnasium and a mob of [[Apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction|post-apocalypse]] [[mutant (fiction)|mutant]]s along the way. They reach Ellie and successfully deactivate the gizmo, causing time to return to normal just as emergency crews and police show up. Moments later, Dr. Roberts reappears, rejoicing in an unexpected trip to [[Woodstock]], and proudly gives Michael an \"A\" grade on his science project under the condition that he gets rid of the machine, saying it's not something mankind is ready for. Roberts is then arrested by the local sheriff ([[Richard Masur]]), who thinks he blew up the power lines - as Michael had accidentally left Robert's peace medallion at the hardware store.\n\nAs promised, Michael returns the gizmo back to the junkyard where he found it. On the way back, the car runs out of gas and he and Ellie leave it by the side of the road; in contrast to his previous devotion to it, he says \"It's just a car.\"\n\n== International release ==\nThe distributors of the movie in Sweden thought it should be marketed as a mix of ''[[Ghostbusters]]'' and ''Back to the Future''. It was subsequently renamed ''TimeBusters''.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}\n\n== Reception ==\nThe film holds a rating of 11% on [[Rotten Tomatoes]], based on 9 reviews.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/my_science_project |title=''My Science Project'' |publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] }}</ref> \n[[The New York Times|New York Times]] critic [[Stephen Holden]] wrote on August 10, 1985; \"''My Science Project'' is a cheerful teen-age adventure film that in its snappier moments resembles a far less clever and less expensive ''[[Back to the Future]]''. Despite a plot that has few interesting twists and a shoestring budget, the film glimmers with moments of drollery.\"<ref>{{cite news|title= FILM: 'SCIENCE PROJECT,' FROM JONATHAN BETUEL|work= [[The New York Times]]|author-link=Stephen Holden |last=Holden |first=Stephen |date=August 10, 1985|url= https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9F0DE4DF1E38F933A2575BC0A963948260 |access-date=2021-06-05}}</ref>\n\n=== Box office ===\nThe film was not a success.
