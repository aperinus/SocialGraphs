Rhodes ultimately rises to great fame and influence on national television. The character was inspired by Schulberg's acquaintance with [[Will Rogers Jr.|Will Rogers Jr]]. The successes of [[Arthur Godfrey]] and [[Tennessee Ernie Ford]] were also acknowledged in the screenplay.\n\nThe film launched Griffith into stardom but got mixed reviews upon its original release. Later decades have seen favorable reappraisals of the movie. In  2008 it was selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] as \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".<ref>{{Cite web|title=Cinematic Classics, Legendary Stars, Comedic Legends and Novice Filmmakers Showcase the 2008 Film Registry|url=https://www.loc.gov/item/prn-08-237/2008-entries-to-national-film-registry-announced/2008-12-30/|access-date=2020-09-30|website=Library of Congress}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Complete National Film Registry Listing |url=https://www.loc.gov/programs/national-film-preservation-board/film-registry/complete-national-film-registry-listing/|access-date=2020-09-30|website=Library of Congress}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nIn late 1950s America, radio journalist Marcia Jeffries encounters a drunken drifter, Larry Rhodes, while recording a segment at a rural [[Arkansas]] jail. She invites him to speak to the audience and sing while playing his [[guitar]], and his raw voice, folksy humor and personal charm make him instantly popular. Marcia [[Pseudonym|dubs him]] \"Lonesome\" Rhodes and fast-tracks him onto his own [[radio program]].\n\nMarcia enlists the support of the show's staff writer Mel Miller and witnesses the charismatic Rhodes ad-lib his way to [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]]-area popularity, effectively criticizing local politicians along the way.\n\nWhen he pokes fun at his sponsor, a mattress company, it initially pulls its ads, but when his adoring audience revolts, burning mattresses in the street, the sponsor discovers that Rhodes's irreverent pitches actually increased sales by 55%, and Rhodes returns to the air with a new awareness of his persuasive power. He begins an affair with Marcia and proposes to her.\n\nAn ambitious office worker at the mattress company, Joey DePalma, puts together a deal for Rhodes to star in a new TV show in New York City. The sponsor is Vitajex, an energy supplement that Rhodes ingeniously reimagines as a yellow pill marketed as a [[Penis enlargement|male enhancement]] product. As his fame, influence, and ego increase, Rhodes is enlisted to improve the appeal of presidential hopeful Senator Worthington Fuller of [[California]], and rebrands the stuffy conservative as an [[everyman]] with the folksy nickname \"Curly\".\n\nIn contrast to his friendly onscreen persona, Rhodes has privately become an egomaniac who berates his staff. Marcia's hopes of marrying Rhodes are dashed, first when a woman turns up claiming to be his legitimate wife, and then when he returns from alleged divorce proceedings in Mexico, newly married to 17-year-old drum majorette Betty Lou. Rhodes and Marcia enter into a profit-sharing agreement after she reminds him of her role in his success.\n\nUltimately, Rhodes's ascent into fame and arrogance begins to turn on him. Joey has an [[affair]] with Rhodes's young wife. Rhodes dumps her and sends her back to Arkansas, but can't get out of his business arrangement with Joey, who [[Blackmail|threatens]] to reveal Rhodes's secrets.\n\nRhodes visits Marcia, who has come to regret her role in making him famous while he proposed his \"Fighters for Fuller\" proposal. While Rhodes gets comfortable, Marcia leaves in the rain. To destroy him, she activates a [[Microphone gaffe|live microphone]] over the end credits of his TV show that reveals Rhodes contemptuously mocking Fuller and the station's \"idiot\" viewers. His popularity and the show's ratings plummet, and the advertisers cancel their sponsorships, as Rhodes descends in an elevator to the ground floor.\n\nRhodes returns to his penthouse, where he was scheduled to address the nation's business and political elite, only to find the room empty, except for his friend, Beanie, and a few Black servants, whom he dismisses when they don't respond to his demands. He discovers the truth during a phone call with Mel and Marcia and threatens suicide, but Marcia only goads him on. When the pair arrive at Rhodes's home, they find him speaking with an applause machine replacing the people whose support he lost. Marcia tells Rhodes that she was responsible for his open-microphone incident and demands that he never call her again.\n\nBefore they leave, Mel lays out a prediction of Rhodes's future: his career is not completely over, and he will likely find further TV work soon, but never again enjoy the same level of popularity and prestige. After leaving the building, Mel and Marcia hear Rhodes screaming from the penthouse, for Marcia to return to him, but ignore him as they depart into the night in a taxi, as a [[Coca-Cola]] sign in [[neon light]]s flashes continuously.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Andy Griffith]] as Larry \"Lonesome\" Rhodes\n* [[Patricia Neal]] as Marcia Jeffries\n* [[Anthony Franciosa]] as Joey DePalma\n* [[Walter Matthau]] as Mel Miller\n* [[Lee Remick]] as Betty Lou Fleckum\n* [[Percy Waram]] as Gen.
