The second installment in the [[Ted (franchise)|''Ted'' franchise]], it serves as a [[sequel]] to the [[Ted (film)|2012 film of the same name]]. The film stars [[Mark Wahlberg]] and MacFarlane, and follows the talking teddy bear Ted as he fights for his civil rights in order to be recognized as a person and not as property. The film also stars [[Amanda Seyfried]], with [[Giovanni Ribisi]] and [[Jessica Barth]] reprising their roles and [[John Slattery]] and [[Morgan Freeman]] joining the cast.\n\n[[Principal photography]] began in [[Massachusetts]] in July 2014. ''Ted 2'' was released on June 26, 2015, by [[Universal Pictures]]. Despite the film failing to achieve the critical and commercial success of its predecessor and receiving mixed reviews from critics, it still became a box office success, grossing $215.9 million on a $68 million budget.\n\n==Plot== \nThree years after the events of the first film, Ted marries his girlfriend, Tami-Lynn. Meanwhile, his best friend, John Bennett has been divorced from Lori Collins for six months. Following a heated argument after being married a year, they decide to have a child. As Ted does not have sperm, John agrees to help find a donor. They ask [[Sam J. Jones]] but he declines due to a sperm count of one. Then they unsuccessfully try to break into [[Tom Brady]]'s house and [[sperm theft|steal his sperm]]. Ultimately, John offers to donate his sperm.\n\nDespite Ted and John's efforts, Tami-Lynn's history of drug use has rendered her infertile (despite having been clean for an extended period of time) and they decide to adopt. The background checks put Ted's legal status as a person into question. The state authorities of [[Massachusetts]] declare Ted property rather than a person; consequently, he loses his job at Bay Colony Grocery Store, his credit card and bank accounts are terminated and his marriage to Tami-Lynn is forcibly annulled.\n\nJohn suggests that they take the state to court. They ask the best lawyer they can find, but he offers to assign their case ''[[pro bono]]'' to his niece Samantha \"Sam\", a novice lawyer. They are initially reluctant due to her lack of pop culture knowledge, but bond over their love of marijuana as they prepare to present the case.\n\nMeanwhile, Donny, Ted's life-long stalker, is a janitor at the headquarters of toy company [[Hasbro]], in [[New York City]]. He convinces the company CEO to hire an expert attorney to ensure that Ted maintains his status as property, leaving him open to seizure by the firm to create more living teddy bears.\n\nDespite Sam's best efforts, the court rules against Ted. Disheartened and desperate, the trio contact Patrick Meighan, a highly respected civil rights attorney, to help overturn the court's decision. Driving to Manhattan, the trio meet Meighan, who is sympathetic to Ted's plight but ultimately refuses the case, as he believes Ted has not significantly contributed to humanity due to his lifestyle.\n\nFurious at the injustice and jealous of Sam and John's relationship, Ted takes his frustrations out on them and angrily storms off, wandering into the [[New York Comic-Con]]. However, Donny discreetly follows him. Once inside, Donny disguises himself as [[Raphael (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Raphael]] and tries to kidnap Ted, who runs off, takes refuge under a [[Bumblebee (Transformers)|Bumblebee]] statue, and contacts John for help. John and Sam arrive and find Ted, just as Donny is about to cut him open. Ted apologizes to John and Sam for snapping at them and make their leave, but Donny severs the cables holding up a model of the [[USS Enterprise (NCC-1701-D)|USS ''Enterprise'']] with a knife and it swings towards Ted. John pushes Ted out of the way, takes the hit, gets knocked unconscious, and falls into a coma. Ted identifies Donny from a group of Ninja Turtle cosplayers through his irresistible urge to dance to \"[[I Think We're Alone Now]]\" by [[Tiffany Darwish|Tiffany]] and Donny is arrested.\n\nAt the hospital, John is still in a coma, and he flatlines. The next day, the doctor informs Sam, Ted and Tami-Lynn that John \"[[Death|didn't make it]]\", shocking the group. The doctor also suggests they can go in and say goodbye to John. In the room, the group is tearfully saying goodbye to John. However, he unexpectedly wakes up and scares the group, and Ted realizes that John had faked being dead as payback for [[Ted (film)|Ted pretending to be brain dead]] and Ted applauds John for his realistic acting. Although Sam is initially furious over this, she and John kiss as the group rejoices. Meighan decides to take the case, inspired by John's selflessness and Ted's emotions over John, who managed to avoid death. Meighan successfully gets the ruling overturned by demonstrating that Ted is self-aware, that he feels complex emotions, and is capable of empathy. Outside the courthouse, Ted re-proposes to Tami-Lynn. After they are legally remarried, Ted and Tami-Lynn adopt the surname of \"[[Clubber Lang]]\", and adopt a baby boy, who they name [[Apollo Creed]], while John and Sam happily pursue their own relationship.\n\n==Cast==\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Seth MacFarlane]] as Ted Clubber-Lang {{small|(voice and motion capture)}}\n* [[Mark Wahlberg]] as John Bennett\n* [[Amanda Seyfried]] as Samantha Leslie Jackson\n* [[Jessica Barth]] as Tami-Lynn McCafferty\n* [[Giovanni Ribisi]] as Donny<ref>[http://www.wearemoviegeeks.com/2015/02/jurassic-world-seventh-son-ted-2-fifty-shades-grey-super-bowl-spots/ JURASSIC WORLD, SEVENTH SON, TED 2, FIFTY SHADES OF GREY Super Bowl Spots]</ref>\n* [[Morgan Freeman]] as Patrick Meighan\n* [[John Slattery]] as Shep Wild<ref name=\"EW\">{{cite magazine|url=http://insidemovies.ew.com/2014/09/25/john-slattery-joins-ted-2/|title=John Slattery joins 'Ted 2'|magazine=Entertainment Weekly|access-date=September 27, 2014}}</ref>\n* [[Patrick Warburton]] as Guy<ref name=\"Warburton\" />\n* [[Michael Dorn]] as Rick<ref name=\"MichaelDorn\">{{cite web |first=Seth |last=MacFarlane |author-link=Seth MacFarlane |url=https://twitter.com/SethMacFarlane/status/512053501720272896 |title=Hilarious work in Ted 2 today by @paddywarbucks and @akaWorf! |publisher=[[Twitter]] |date=September 16, 2014 |access-date=September 23, 2014}}</ref>\n* [[Bill Smitrovich]] as Frank\n* [[Cocoa Brown]] as Joy\n* [[John Carroll Lynch]] as Tom Jessup\n* [[Ron Canada]] as Judge Matheson\n* [[Jessica Szohr]] as Allison\n* [[Jay Patterson]] as Karl Jackson\n* [[Tara Strong]] as Ted's \"I Love You\" function\n* [[Sam J.
