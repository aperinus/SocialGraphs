Emotionally adrift, Judy tells her story on a radio call-in show and meets another caller, Army recruiter SFC James Ballard, who leads her to believe military life will provide the \"family\" she seeks. He also pitches the service as a getaway, comparing it to a spa vacation, but Judy has a rude awakening upon arriving at [[basic training]], realizing the recruiter conned her. She wants to quit almost immediately, but is astonished to find out, contrary to the assertions of her recruiting sergeant, that she cannot leave.\n\nArmy regulations and the continual disapproval of both Captain Doreen Lewis and SFC L. C. Ross, the [[Drill instructor|drill sergeant]], frustrate Judy\u2014but when her parents arrive at Fort Biloxi to take her home, berating her for \"punishing\" them with her decisions, she decides to stay and finish basic training. Judy does complete her training after a war games exercise in which her squad exposes an affair between a member of her training platoon and a rival company officer (with whom Lewis was also having an affair), and takes the leaders of both sides hostage. Upon completion of basic training, Judy and her friends spend the weekend on leave in New Orleans, where she meets Henri Tremont, a French doctor there for a medical conference. After a brief romance, Henri returns to Paris and Judy begins training with an elite paratrooper unit, the Thornbirds.\n\nJudy quickly discovers she was chosen for paratrooper training because the unit's commander finds her attractive; after the other trainees have jumped from the plane, he attempts to sexually assault her. When Judy jumps out of the plane rather than comply, he attempts to have her transferred far from Biloxi as soon as possible. Rather than accept what she sees as an undesirable post in [[Greenland]] or [[Guam]], Judy negotiates an assignment to [[Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe]] in [[Belgium]], and meets up with Henri again on a visit to Paris. He proposes marriage and she accepts, but when Captain Lewis discovers that Tremont is a communist, Judy is forced to choose between the Army and love.\n\nAfter she chooses Henri and gets engaged, he reveals his childish, controlling nature. He tries to \"remake\" Judy, and also insists she sign a prenuptial agreement to protect his centuries-old family home. Finally, when Henri sleeps with the house maid and also makes it obvious that he has not got over his ex-girlfriend Clare, Judy has a change of heart. On her wedding day, in the middle of the ceremony, she realizes she is on the verge of a huge mistake. Judy abandons Henri at the altar and heads off into the unknown, empowered by her newfound freedom and excited about what may lie ahead.\n\n==Cast==\n\n* [[Goldie Hawn]] as Private Judith Benjamin\n* [[Eileen Brennan]] as Captain Doreen Lewis\n* [[Armand Assante]] as Henri Alan Tremont\n* [[Robert Webber]] as Colonel Clay Thornbush\n* [[Sam Wanamaker]] as Theodore Benjamin, Judy's father\n* [[Barbara Barrie]] as Harriet Benjamin, Judy's mother\n* [[Mary Kay Place]] as Private/2nd Lieutenant Mary Lou Glass\n* [[Harry Dean Stanton]] as Sergeant First Class Jim Ballard\n* [[Albert Brooks]] as Yale Goodman\n* [[Richard Herd]] as Brigadier General Foley\n* [[Toni Kalem]] as Private Gianelli\n* [[Damita Jo Freeman]] as Private Gloria Moe\n* Alston Ahern as Private P.
