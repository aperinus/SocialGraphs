A ''[[Mickey Mouse Works]]'' short, ''Pluto Gets The Paper: Spaceship'', was shown in theaters with it. The film received negative reviews from critics and was a [[box office bomb]], grossing $36.8 million against a $65 million budget.\n\n==Plot==\nThe film opens on [[Mars]], showing the last moments of a Mars rover's mission. As the rover prepares to sample Martian rock, it sadly \"''kicks the bucket''\". The mission controllers congratulate themselves on a \"''successful''\" mission, while back on Mars the scene pans up from the dead rover to show a huge undiscovered [[Martian]] city. A spaceship is seen quickly rocketing from the city and accelerating into space.\n\nNews producer Tim O'Hara is fired for unwittingly \"''compromising''\" reporter Brace Channing, the daughter of his boss, Mr. Channing, during a live broadcast of the first [[Space Shuttle]] launch from [[Vandenberg Air Force Base]]. His assistant, Lizzie tries to comfort him and she apparently has a crush on him.\n\nLater that night, while driving, Tim witnesses a small Martian [[spacecraft]] crash landing. Realizing his chance to deliver a story that will \"rock the Earth,\" he brings Brace to show her the ship, but by the time he reaches the crash site, the ship has been shrunk to toy size. Nearby, its only occupant hides in the bushes. Tim takes the now-shrunken spaceship home with him and the Martian follows him to retrieve it. After a confrontation, Tim is knocked out and the Martian disguises himself with a \"''nerplex''\", a piece of alien [[Chewing gum|gum]] that can transform anyone into another life form, to look like Tim and ends up kissing Lizzie when she visits.\n\nWhen Tim confronts the Martian the next morning, he finds out that a small device called an \"electron accelerator,\" which powers the control systems of the ship, is damaged beyond repair and the Martian needs Tim's help to find a replacement. The Martian takes the name \"Uncle Martin\" and explores the city with Tim, unaware that they are being watched by [[Search for extraterrestrial intelligence|SETI]], which discovered [[DNA]] left by Martin while hiding out at Tim's. While exploring Tim's neighborhood, Martin tells him about a friend of his named \"''Neenert''\", one of his planet's most gifted Martian scientists, who came to Earth in 1964, but never came back. Brace is captured by the SETI gang and is interrogated.\n\nTim secretly tapes Martin and his sentient suit, Zoot, with hidden cameras to back up his story and impress the television station staff in hopes of getting his job back, but he eventually decides not to reveal the tapes, as he has become fond of Martin. Meanwhile, Martin and Zoot discover a subsystem of the ship called the Interstellar Safety System, which is prepared to self-destruct.\n\nBrace discovers the footage of Martin in his Martian form and she steals the tape. Lizzie shows up at Tim's house to discover Brace stealing the tape. Thinking that Tim cheated on her, Lizzie rejects him and storms out, only to be distracted by the now-full-sized spaceship and is pulled into the cockpit by Zoot. Martin and Tim go after the Martian evidence, shrinking the ship (along with Zoot and Lizzie) and racing down to the station, where Tim admits to Martin that he has been videotaping him, but says he likes Martin and apologizes. Accepting Tim's apology, Martin subdues Brace, disguising himself as her so he can take her place on the news and Martin's alien form is almost exposed during the broadcast, which is carefully watched by Elliott Coleye, head of SETI.\n\nAs footage from another news report is aired, Tim and Martin escape the station, pursued by SETI through the sewers in Tim's car, shrunken using Martin's device. They eventually end up in the hands of Coleye, who takes them back to SETI for investigation. At the lab, Tim tricks one of the scientists into growing Martin's ship to normal size, breaching security, and allowing Lizzie and Zoot to escape. However, the trio's escape is blocked by two security guards, one of whom shoots and injures Zoot. With the help of a black spiked nerplex, Lizzie transforms into a hideous monster from \"Veenox 7,\" kills the guards, spits out the nerplex and turns back into a human.\n\nThe three eventually succeed in locating Martin, who has undergone surgery involving the removal of his antennae and putting him in a deathlike comatose state. When Martin and Zoot reunite, he comes back to life and wakes up. They then escape SETI headquarters and Tim and Lizzie prepare to bid farewell to Martin, installing a car alternator in place of the ship's damaged electron accelerator. However, they are interrupted by Coleye, who attempts to stop him from escaping; declaring that he will stop at nothing to prove the existence of aliens, even if it means killing Martin in the process. A SETI official named Armitan, revealed to be Martin's old friend Neenert, saves Martin by destroying Coleye's gun and then tossing Coleye wildly in the air. After a reunion, Martin and Neenert fly back to Mars on their ship; much to Coleye's dismay.\n\nBy chance, Coleye catches hold of the piece of nerplex left behind by Neenert. Believing that he can still prove his cause, while ignoring warnings from Tim and Lizzie, Coleye chews on it and he is turned into an Martian. Laughing in excitement and delight, Coleye accidentally swallows the gum (presumably leaving his new form permanent). He ends up caught and tranquilized by his own organization, as Tim and Lizzie escape the scene.\n\nIn the end, Martin and Zoot decide to return to Earth and stay with Tim and Lizzie, while Neenert flies Martin's spacecraft back to Mars. Tim expresses initial reluctance to Martin's staying at first, but Lizzie convinces Tim to change his mind.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Christopher Lloyd]] as Uncle Martin/The Martian, a hapless alien stranded on Earth who must work with Tim to find a way to escape SETI and return to Mars.\n* [[Jeff Daniels]] as Tim O'Hara, a down-on-his luck news producer who inadvertently becomes Martin's roommate and is soon drawn into danger when SETI becomes aware of Martin's presence.\n* [[Elizabeth Hurley]] as Brace Channing, a serious reporter who will do anything to get ahead; she seduces Tim and steals information about Martin's true identity.\n* [[Daryl Hannah]] as Lizzie, Tim's innocent, good-natured camera operator who is in love with him and is drawn into adventure once realizing Martin is from another world.\n* [[Wallace Shawn]] as Dr. Elliott Coleye, a mischievous SETI scientist who will stop at nothing to capture Martin.\n* [[Wayne Knight]] as Zoot, Martin's sentient, wise-cracking metallic suit.
