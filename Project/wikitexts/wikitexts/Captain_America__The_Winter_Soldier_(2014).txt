It is the sequel to ''[[Captain America: The First Avenger]]'' (2011) and [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe films|the ninth film]] in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU). The film was directed by [[Russo brothers|Anthony and Joe Russo]] from a screenplay by the writing team of [[Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely]]. It stars [[Chris Evans (actor)|Chris Evans]] as [[Steve Rogers (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Steve Rogers / Captain America]] alongside [[Scarlett Johansson]], [[Sebastian Stan]], [[Anthony Mackie]], [[Cobie Smulders]], [[Frank Grillo]], [[Emily VanCamp]], [[Hayley Atwell]], [[Robert Redford]], and [[Samuel L. Jackson]]. In the film, Captain America joins forces with [[Natasha Romanoff (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Black Widow]] (Johansson) and [[Sam Wilson (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Falcon]] (Mackie) to uncover a conspiracy within the spy agency [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] while facing a mysterious assassin known as the [[Bucky Barnes (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Winter Soldier]] (Stan).\n\nMarkus and McFeely began writing the sequel around the release of ''The First Avenger'' in July 2011. The script draws from the Winter Soldier story arc in the comic books written by [[Ed Brubaker]] as well as [[conspiracy fiction]] from the 1970s such as ''[[Three Days of the Condor]]'' (1975). The film explores S.H.I.E.L.D., similarly to how the first film explored the U.S. military, after Rogers was shown working for the agency in the MCU crossover film ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]'' (2012). The Russo brothers signed to direct in June 2012 and casting began the following month. Filming began in April 2013 in Los Angeles, California, before moving to Washington, D.C., and [[Cleveland]], [[Ohio]]. The directors used [[practical effect]]s and intense stunt work, but also 2,500 visual effects shots created by six companies.\n\n''Captain America: The Winter Soldier'' premiered in Los Angeles on March 13, 2014, and was released in the United States on April 4, as part of [[Marvel Cinematic Universe: Phase Two|Phase Two]] of the MCU. The film recieved positive reviews with praise for the performances, stunts, direction, screenplay, score, action sequences, and the darker and more serious tone compared to other MCU projects, with many considering it to be the best film in the franchise. It was a box office success, having grossed over $714 million worldwide, making it the [[2014 in film#Highest-grossing films|seventh-highest-grossing film of 2014]], and received an [[Academy Award]] nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Visual Effects|Best Visual Effects]]. A sequel titled ''[[Captain America: Civil War]]'', also directed by the Russos, was released in 2016.\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Plot==\n<!--Per WP:FILMPLOT, plots should be 400 to 700 words only.-->\nTwo years after the [[Battle of New York (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Battle of New York]],{{refn|name=Timeline|group=N|As depicted in ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]'' (2012).<ref name=\"CapTWSSynopsis1\" />}} [[Steve Rogers (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Steve Rogers]] works in [[Washington, D.C.]], for the espionage agency [[S.H.I.E.L.D. (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|S.H.I.E.L.D.]], while adjusting to contemporary society. During a mission alongside Agent [[Natasha Romanoff (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Natasha Romanoff]] and S.H.I.E.L.D.'s [[counter-terrorism]] [[S.T.R.I.K.E. (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|S.T.R.I.K.E.]] team led by Agent [[Brock Rumlow (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Brock Rumlow]] to free hostages aboard a S.H.I.E.L.D. vessel from pirates led by [[Georges Batroc (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Georges Batroc]], Rogers discovers Romanoff has another agenda: to extract data from the ship's computers. Returning to the [[Triskelion (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Triskelion]], S.H.I.E.L.D.'s headquarters, Rogers confronts Director [[Nick Fury (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Nick Fury]] and is briefed about Project Insight: three [[Helicarriers (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Helicarriers]] linked to spy satellites, designed to preemptively eliminate threats. Unable to decrypt Romanoff's data, Fury becomes suspicious about Insight and asks senior S.H.I.E.L.D. official and Secretary of Internal Security [[Alexander Pierce (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Alexander Pierce]] to delay the project.\n\nOn his way to rendezvous with [[Maria Hill (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Maria Hill]], Fury is ambushed by assailants led by an assassin called the Winter Soldier. Escaping to Rogers' apartment, Fury warns him that S.H.I.E.L.D. is compromised, but is wounded by the Winter Soldier, before handing Rogers a [[USB flash drive|flash drive]] containing the ship's data. Fury is pronounced dead during surgery, and Hill recovers the body. The next day, Pierce summons Rogers to the Triskelion. When Rogers withholds Fury's information, Pierce brands him a fugitive. Hunted by S.T.R.I.K.E., Rogers meets with Romanoff. Using the data, they discover a secret S.H.I.E.L.D. bunker in New Jersey, where they activate a [[supercomputer]] containing the [[mind uploading|preserved consciousness]] of [[Arnim Zola (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Arnim Zola]]. Zola informs them that after being captured by Rogers during [[World War II]],{{refn|name=film|group=N|As depicted in ''[[Captain America: The First Avenger]]'' (2011).}} he [[Operation Paperclip|was recruited]] to S.H.I.E.L.D., where he secretly reformed [[Hydra (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Hydra]] within its ranks, sowing global chaos to make humanity surrender its freedom in exchange for security, using the Winter Soldier as their primary assassin. The pair narrowly escape death when a S.H.I.E.L.D. missile destroys the bunker, and realize that Pierce is Hydra's leader within S.H.I.E.L.D.\n\nRogers and Romanoff enlist the help of [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs|VA]] employee and former [[United States Air Force Pararescue|USAF pararescueman]] [[Sam Wilson (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Sam Wilson]], whom Rogers befriended, and acquire a powered \"[[EXO-7 Falcon|Falcon]]\" [[Wingsuit flying|wingpack]] used by Wilson while he was in the Air Force. They capture S.H.I.E.L.D. agent [[Jasper Sitwell (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Jasper Sitwell]], a Hydra [[Mole (espionage)|mole]], forcing him to divulge that Zola developed a [[data-mining]] algorithm that can identify individuals becoming threats to Hydra. The Insight Helicarriers will sweep the globe, using satellite-guided guns to eliminate them. Sitwell is killed in an ambush by the Winter Soldier, whom Rogers recognizes as [[Bucky Barnes (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Bucky Barnes]], his longtime best friend previously thought dead; he had survived due to Zola's experimentation, and has been repeatedly brainwashed and cryogenically frozen to perform Hydra's missions. Hill manages to extract the trio to a safehouse where Fury, who had faked his death, plans to sabotage the Helicarriers by replacing their controller chips.\n\nAfter the [[World Security Council]] members arrive for the Helicarriers' launch, Rogers broadcasts Hydra's plot to everyone at the Triskelion. Romanoff, disguised as one of the Council members, disarms Pierce. Fury arrives and forces Pierce to unlock S.H.I.E.L.D.'s database so that Romanoff can leak classified information, exposing Hydra to the public. Following a struggle, Fury fatally shoots Pierce. Rogers and Wilson storm two Helicarriers and replace the controller chips, but Barnes destroys Wilson's suit and fights Rogers on the third. Rogers fends him off and replaces the final chip, allowing Hill to take control and have the vessels destroy each other. Rogers refuses to fight Barnes in an attempt to reach his friend, but as the ship collides with the Triskelion, Rogers falls into the [[Potomac River]]. Barnes rescues the unconscious Rogers before disappearing into the woods. With S.H.I.E.L.D. in disarray, Romanoff appears before a Senate subcommittee to defend her and Rogers' actions, while Fury, under the cover of his apparent death, heads to Eastern Europe in pursuit of Hydra's remaining cells. Rogers and Wilson decide to find Barnes, while Rumlow, who was a Hydra agent, is hospitalized following the Triskelion's destruction.\n\nIn a [[mid-credits scene]], [[Wolfgang von Strucker (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Baron Wolfgang von Strucker]], at a Hydra lab, proclaims that the \"age of miracles\" has begun as scientists examine an energy-filled scepter{{refn|name=scepter|group=N|Identified off-screen as [[Loki's scepter|the scepter]] used by [[Loki (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Loki]] in ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]''.<ref name=\"CraveLoki\" />}}<!-- NOTE!

It's more about the societal differences. He's gone from the '40s to today; he comes from a world where people were a little more trusting, the threats not as deep. Now, it's harder to tell who's right and wrong. Actions you take to protect people from threats could compromise liberties and privacy. That's tough for Steve to swallow.\"<ref name=\"SlashFilm\" /> Evans trained in \"[[parkour]], [[Brazilian jiu-jitsu]], [[karate]], and [[boxing]]\", as the Russo brothers believed that Rogers being brought to the present \"also meant that he had studied and mastered modern fighting styles and techniques\".

He's not a boy scout, but he is reserved and has a moral center, whereas her moral center moves.\"<ref name=\"MarkusMcFeelyApril2013Collider\" /> The Russos added, \"She's a character who lies for a living. That's what she does. He's a character who tells the truth. Give them a problem and they'll have different ways of approaching it. She's pushing him to modernize, and he's pushing her to add a certain level of integrity to her life.\"<ref name=\"IGNMar2014pg3\" /> When asked about Romanoff's relationship with Rogers, Johansson responded, \"By a series of unfortunate encounters, they will be in a situation in which their friendship becomes more intimate. They share many similarities because they live on the defensive without relying on anyone. Also, the two have been working for the government throughout their professional careers. With their friendship they begin to question what they want and what is their true identity.\"<ref name=\"Refinery29\" />\n* [[Sebastian Stan]] as [[Bucky Barnes (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Bucky Barnes / Winter Soldier]]:<br />Steve Rogers' childhood best friend who has re-emerged as an enhanced brainwashed assassin after supposedly being [[killed in action]] during World War II.<ref name=\"StitchKingdom\" /><ref name=\"StanMackie\" /> Regarding the character, Feige said, \"Winter Soldier has been methodically, almost robotically, following orders for 70 years.\"<ref name=\"EWFeige\" /> Stan said despite his nine-picture deal with Marvel Studios including his appearance in ''The First Avenger'', he was not sure that Bucky would make an imminent return,<ref name=\"StanContract\" /> and only heard the sequel's official title was \"The Winter Soldier\" through a friend attending San Diego Comic-Con.<ref name=SlashFilm2/> Stan endured five months of physical training to prepare for the role and did historical research, stating, \"I dove into the whole [[Cold War]] thing. I looked at the [[KGB]]. I looked at all kinds of spy movies, and all kinds of documentaries about that time, and what it was about. I grabbed anything from that time period. Anything about brainwashing.\"<ref name=\"Stan\" /> Stan also practiced daily with a plastic knife in order to be able to do the Winter Soldier's knife tricks without the aid of a stuntman.<ref name=\"FrontlineFeaturette\" /> Regarding Bucky's transition into the Winter Soldier, Stan said, \"You know, the truth of the situation is although he looks very different and there's different things about him, it still comes from the same person. I think you'll get to see that no matter what. I think part of my goal here was to make sure that you see an extension of that version but just a different color of that same version in a way. I think he's still the same guy; he's cut from the same cloth.\"<ref name=\"Stan2\" /> Stan said he felt the character's introduction in ''The Winter Soldier'' was \"a preview of the guy\", with more aspects of the character being explored in the film's sequel ''[[Captain America: Civil War]]''.<ref name=\"StanCollider\" />\n* [[Anthony Mackie]] as [[Sam Wilson (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Sam Wilson / Falcon]]:<br />A former U.S. Air Force [[United States Air Force Pararescue|pararescueman]] trained by the military in aerial combat using a specially designed wing pack.<ref name=\"StitchKingdom\" /> About the role, Mackie said \"[Wilson is] a really smart guy who went through major military training and becomes a tactical leader.\"<ref name=\"Mackie4\" /> He also remarked, \"He's the first African-American superhero. It makes me feel all the work I've done has been paying off. I have a son, nephews and nieces, and I love the idea that they can dress up as the Falcon on Halloween. They now have someone they can idolize. That's a huge honor for me.\"<ref name=\"Mackie\" /> Marvel, who cast Mackie because of his \"energy and sense of fun\",<ref name=\"IGNMar2014pg3\" /> did not let him read a script before signing on.<ref name=\"Mackie2\" /> Mackie spent five months doing [[Two-a-days (football)|two-a-day]] workouts and eating an 11,000-[[Food energy|calorie]]-per-day diet to get into shape for the role.<ref name=\"Mackie3\" /> Commenting on Rogers' relationship with Wilson, Evans said, \"Meeting Mackie's character, he used to serve, now he works at the [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs|VA]] counseling guys who come home with [[PTSD]]\u2014they connect on that level. I think they're both wounded warriors who don't bleed on other people. Cap has no one to bleed on. I think Mackie knows how to handle people like that. ...

You're only allowed to do certain stunts. There is an amazing team of stunt people that do most of the work in this film. But, I studied a lot of [[tae kwon do]]. I also did a lot of training just with weapons because I'm not very comfortable around guns. I had to get comfortable because that's my character's thing...

We're just sort of introducing her. When we first see her we realize she's living next to Captain America... they sort of have a little thing going on and as we all know in the comic books they had a love affair off and on for years. They had a very complicated relationship. It's almost as if they are planting the seeds now. Sort of leaving room to go wherever they want to go with it.\"<ref name=\"ScreenRant\" /> Regarding her casting, Joe Russo said, \"We wanted someone that Cap would have an immediate interest in. It had to be a strong-willed person, and we felt that Emily's work on ''[[Revenge (TV series)|Revenge]]'' was a great test tube for what this character could be.

He has to ask, is he even lying to himself, too? He has a very good idea of what's going on but his paranoia keeps him from believing some of it.\"<ref name=\"SlashFilm\" /> Jackson added, \"You see Nick Fury the office guy, him going about the day-to-day work of S.H.I.E.L.D. and the politics as opposed to that other stuff. It's great to have him dealing with Captain America in terms of being able to speak to him soldier to soldier and try to explain to him how the world has changed in another way while he was frozen in time.

They don't always agree on how S.H.I.E.L.D. ought to be used.\"<ref name=\"IGNMar2014pg3\" /> The writers gave Fury a more prominent role in ''The Winter Soldier'', since within a plot featuring S.H.I.E.L.D. being dismantled, Fury would \"take the brunt of it\". They also intended on depicting a character that had so far been depicted as a self-assured, commanding man as vulnerable, to enhance the sense of danger in the Hydra conspiracy.<ref name=\"AudioCommentary\" />\n\nAdditionally, [[Toby Jones]],<ref name=\"Jones\" /> [[Maximiliano Hern\u00e1ndez]],<ref name=\"Hernandez\" /> and [[Garry Shandling]]<ref name=\"Shandling\" /> reprise their roles from previous MCU films as [[Arnim Zola (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Arnim Zola]], [[Jasper Sitwell (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Jasper Sitwell]], and Senator [[Stern (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Stern]], respectively.

Gary Gray withdrew his name from consideration, choosing instead to direct the [[N.W.A]] biographical film ''[[Straight Outta Compton (2015 film)|Straight Outta Compton]]''.<ref name=\"Deadline\" />\n\n====Writing====\nMcFeely said the writing began in the middle of 2011, around the release of ''The First Avenger'', with him and Markus \"noodling on in hopes that there would be a second one and we did a lot of just throwing stuff at the wall and seeing what stuck\".<ref name=SlashFilm3/> The first few months of writing were a back and forth process with Marvel, but after an outline was finished, the story did not change much.<ref name=\"MarkusMcFeelyApril2013SlashFilm\" /> They opted to set the story in the present day, and, after \"experimenting with flashback elements for more period World War II stuff\",<ref name=\"ScreenJunkies\" /> decided to abandon the flashbacks as \"it became unwieldy.\"<ref name=SlashFilm3/> The film would be \"Cap versus the world we all live in today\",<ref name=\"Vulture\" /> while averting excessive comedy regarding the hero's time displacement, as Markus considered the Captain \"the most adaptive man on the planet.\"<ref name=SlashFilm3/> The tone would be more grounded in reality despite the advanced technology to contrast the fantasy elements from both the first ''Captain America'' and ''The Avengers''.<ref name=\"Vulture\" /> Despite that, the comic book origins guaranteed that the film would have no [[Verisimilitude (narrative)|verisimilitude]].<ref name=\"AudioCommentary\" /> This still proved a challenge in the reveal of Arnim Zola, that had to be extensively rewritten to convey how \"this grounded espionage paranoid thriller suddenly screeches to a halt and you switch gears really quickly with this [[ghost in the machine]]\" that introduces more science fiction elements.<ref name=\"EmpireSecrets\" />\n\nMarkus and McFeely wanted to adapt [[Ed Brubaker]]'s Winter Soldier storyline from the comics, which they described as \"the tone of Cap's modern franchise\",<ref name=\"SFXAug2014\" /> but it took the duo six months to convince themselves they could do it.<ref name=\"SlashFilm2\" /> In the meantime, while thinking how to progress from the [[war film]] tone of ''The First Avenger'', the writers settled on the [[Conspiracy fiction|conspiracy genre]] for the screenplay, and cited ''[[Three Days of the Condor]]'', ''[[The Parallax View]]'', and ''[[Marathon Man (film)|Marathon Man]]'' as influences, feeling it better conveyed Captain America's trust issues and contrasting values in the new world he was living in,<ref name=\"SlashFilm2\" /> with Markus saying, \"If you put that 1940s man into present day geo-politics everything is going to seem like a conspiracy. It's just going to seem dirty and underhanded and shifty, and people won't be telling the truth.\"<ref name=\"SFXAug2014\" /> ''Three Days of the Condor'' in particular was used as the main source of the script structure, following the idea that the protagonist is being chased by a threat they, along with the audience, only discover halfway through the film.<ref name=\"AudioCommentary\" />\n\nThe writers felt this approach was similar to how [[Stan Lee]] reinvented Captain America in the 1960s and 1970s, with \"the Captain dealing with all sorts of the same things that the country [was] dealing with\u2014[[Vietnam War|Vietnam]], [[Watergate scandal|Watergate]] and all that stuff\u2014so he gets to have opinions on that\", thus making the \"guy who is ostensibly from the more black and white 1940s react to this ultimately grey world that we live in.\"<ref name=\"SuperheroHypeMarkusMcFeely\" /> Marvel Studios president [[Kevin Feige]] described the film as a [[political thriller]],<ref name=\"Variety\" /> and as the duo struggled to figure out a third act, Feige suggested that S.H.I.E.L.D. be brought down and have Captain America fight the agency. The writers thought this was a great story point, for implementing \"the physical manifestation of Cap changing the world.\"<ref name=\"DenWriters\" /> Markus even noted how the 1970s comics had similar conspiracies.<ref name=\"SFXAug2014\" /> The Hydra reveal made sure to include returning characters among the undercover villains, as well as references to the comics such as Arnim Zola being kept alive as a machine.<ref name=\"Vulture\" /> Feige later elaborated on the political thriller nature of the film saying, <blockquote>In our attempt to make all of our films feel unique and feel different we found ourselves going back to things like [''Three Days of the Condor'']. Also the other political thrillers of the '70s: ''The Parallax View'', ''[[All the President's Men (film)|All the President's Men]]''. This was a time that Cap existed in the comics. He found himself in the swinging '60s followed by the [[Watergate scandal|Watergate]] Era followed by the [[Reagan Era]] followed by where we are today. In the comics it was a hell of a journey for Steve. And we couldn't take him through those years because in our cinematic universe he was asleep. But we wanted to force him to confront that kind of moral conundrum, something with that '70s flavor. And in our film that takes the form of S.H.I.E.L.D.<ref name=\"Empire\" /></blockquote>\n\nFeige said that Steve Rogers would be paired with other characters from ''The Avengers'' like [[Natasha Romanoff (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Black Widow]] and [[Nick Fury (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Nick Fury]], because unlike [[Tony Stark (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Tony Stark]] and [[Thor (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Thor]], who could return to their own supporting casts, Rogers had nowhere else to go, \"and it just made sense that he was the one that stayed with what remains of the Avengers at the end of the film.\"<ref name=\"MTV3\" /> The writers considered including [[Clint Barton (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Hawkeye]], but \"he didn't have enough to do and suddenly it seemed like we were giving him short shrift\", leading all of his parts to be fulfilled by Black Widow,<ref name=\"SFXAug2014\" /> and Joe Russo added that [[Jeremy Renner]]'s schedule could not be worked out for him to appear.<ref name=\"RussoHawkeye\" /> As to why the [[Red Skull (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Red Skull]] from ''The First Avenger'' did not appear in ''The Winter Soldier'', Joe Russo explained, \"I know we have a guy in a computer, but the tone we were chasing was sort of that conspiracy thriller. And we wanted to try and ground the movie as much as we could. And Red Skull, he's a fantastical character and didn't necessarily fit for ''Cap 2'' and especially because it was about the fall of S.H.I.E.L.D. Certainly Hydra exists and that's his legacy, but there's something interesting about the fact that his legacy outlived the skull. And they're still dealing with the demons of it, but not necessarily him.\"<ref name=\"RedSkull\" /> [[Chris McKenna (writer)|Chris McKenna]], who worked with the Russo brothers on the sitcom ''[[Community (TV series)|Community]]'', contributed to the script by writing jokes for the film.<ref name=\"McKenna\" /> The inclusion of the passage \"[[Book of Ezekiel|Ezekiel]] 25:17\" on Fury's tombstone references the character [[Jules Winnfield]], from the 1994 film ''[[Pulp Fiction]]'', also played by [[Samuel L.

Joe even noted how during [[principal photography]], the issues became more topical due to the disclosure of several [[National Security Agency]] [[Global surveillance disclosures (2013\u2013present)|surveillance-related documents]].<ref name=\"MotherJones\" /> At the 2012 [[San Diego Comic-Con International]], it was announced that the official title for the sequel was

Commission announced that ''Captain America: The Winter Soldier'' would film in [[Cleveland]], Ohio after the production was approved for a $9.5 million [[tax credit]].<ref name=\"Cleveland\" /> Producer Nate Moore said that after also serving as a location in ''The Avengers'', [[Government of Cleveland|Cleveland's government]] was helpful in providing large locations for filming, which \"provided production value which we probably could not have built in a backlot.\" McFeely joked that while writing ambitious action scenes \"I did not realize a great American metropolis would say 'Sure, shut down three miles of freeway and go to town'.\"<ref name=\"FrontlineFeaturette\" /> Portions of the film were also scheduled to be shot in California and [[Washington, D.C.]]<ref

Opaloch said that while attempting to emulate the 1970s thrillers that served as inspiration for the writers and directors, the staging and lighting tried to bring realism through \"classic framing and naturalistic lighting\", and the filming was done with [[hand-held camera]]s. To achieve this, Opaloch used [[Arri Alexa]] Plus 4:3 cameras with [[Panavision]] [[anamorphic format|anamorphic]] lenses and [[Codex Digital]] recorders.<ref name=\"Codex\" /> Stunt work aimed for realistic action, prioritizing practical effects. The fight scenes were staged for months, with a choreography that aimed to highlight Captain America's superhuman qualities, and \"move away from impressionistic action into specificity\": the raid on the S.H.I.E.L.D. vessel had stealthiness as the Captain knocked out enemies to avert detection, and the freeway fight with Winter Soldier was more \"last minute\" to highlight the characters' struggle to survive.<ref name=\"FrontlineFeaturette\" />\n\nIn contrast to the quick editing and moving cameras of modern action films, ''The Winter Soldier'' aimed to feature longer action scenes that felt more visceral and dangerous.<ref name=\"AudioCommentary\" /> The Russos mentioned the bank robbing scene of ''[[Heat (1995 film)|Heat]]'' as a major influence, which they described as \"the most intense eight minutes of filmmaking I've seen in a movie theater\",<ref name=\"FrontlineFeaturette\" /> and action scenes directed by [[Brian De Palma]], such as the vault heist in ''[[Mission: Impossible (film)|Mission: Impossible]]'', where \"very likable characters are put in impossible situations that the audience is put on the edge on how they'd escape\". Examples of these types of scenes include the ambushes on Nick Fury in the street and Captain America in the elevator.<ref name=\"AudioCommentary\" />\n\n===Post-production===\n[[File:Hayley Atwell aging VFX in Captain America The Winter Soldier.jpg|thumb|left|Hayley Atwell as Peggy Carter before (top) and after (bottom) she was digitally altered to appear older in the film]]\nAdditional photography was filmed in December 2013 and January 2014,<ref name=\"Reshoots\" /> in order for the Russos to accurately show the state of each character after the defeat of S.H.I.E.L.D., having read the script of ''[[Avengers: Age of Ultron]]'' to guide their choices.<ref name=\"AudioCommentary\" /> [[Joss Whedon]], director of ''The Avengers'' and ''Avengers: Age of Ultron'', wrote and directed the [[post-credits scene|mid-credits scene]],<ref name=\"PostCredits\" /> which featured [[Wanda Maximoff (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Wanda Maximoff]], [[Pietro Maximoff (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Pietro Maximoff]],<ref name=\"OlsenTaylorJohnson\" /> and Baron Wolfgang von Strucker.<ref name=\"Kretschmann\" /> The title sequences were created by design firm Sarofsky, who had worked with the Russos since ''Community''. Sarofsky collaborated with comic book artist [[David W. Mack]] on the sequences.<ref name=\"ScreenMagCredits\" />\n\nAnthony Mackie said the Russo brothers relied on minimal use of [[computer-generated imagery]], stating, \"The Russos, what they did that was so great was, they wanted to stay with live action, which is a dying art form. If they can build it, they built it. If we could do it, we did it. They wanted to do as little CGI as possible. That's why the movie looks so great.\"<ref name=\"MTV2\" /> Nevertheless, six special effects companies are involved in creating the visual effects of the film, including [[Industrial Light & Magic]] (ILM), [[Scanline VFX]], Lola VFX, [[Luma Pictures]], Whiskytree and [[The Embassy Visual Effects|The Embassy]], with [[previsualization]] completed by Proof.<ref name=\"Fxguide\" /> The film contained 2,500 visual effects shots, with 900 worked on by ILM.<ref name=\"ILM\" /> The film featured extensive use of [[Virtual actor|digital doubles]]. Russell Earl, ILM visual effects supervisor, said, \"The character that we did the most work on was Falcon. We knew we were going to do CG wings. We also did some shots with wires and some with stunt doubles and head replacement. And we needed a very good digital double.\"<ref name=\"ILM\" />\n\nLola VFX, who worked on the pre-serum Steve Rogers scenes in this film and ''Captain America: The First Avenger'', also worked on shots featuring an elderly Peggy Carter. This involved digitally transposing the facial features of an elderly actress onto the face of actress [[Hayley Atwell]] who had performed her lines with no make-up and only a few tracking markers.<ref name=\"Fxguide\" />\n\nThe Helicarriers in the film were completely digital. Earl said, \"In [''The Avengers''] it was more like an aircraft carrier, now it's an aircraft carrier with the addition of battle ship-sized guns. We were all over the carriers [with the virtual camera]. We were on the decks; we were flying next to them. We had a lot of close ups and different angles. And we didn't just have one; we had three. On top of that, we had to destroy them all.\" This CGI environment was also used in close ups. Earl said, \"The challenge was to get in all of the detail to make it feel like it is a real, working ship. We created details down to the railings and all the human-scale stuff. ... For the shots in which we were destroying them, we had to have the internals as well\u2014the hallways, the storage areas.\"<ref name=\"ILM\" /> Many of the shots of Washington, D.C. were digitally created due to [[Prohibited airspace#United States|numerous flight restrictions in the city]] which necessitated that locations be recreated by computer.<ref name=\"ILM\" /> However, aerial footage of the city was filmed and used for live action plate photography for shots involving the Triskelion, which is located on [[Theodore Roosevelt Island]] on the Potomac River.<ref name=\"Fxguide\" />\n\n350 different versions of the film were made, to accommodate for the different formats it would be released in domestically, while also accounting for international localization and formats. The versions had to be completed in 17 days, versus a normal turnaround time of three to four weeks for contemporary films, to make its theatrical release date.<ref name=\"DifferentVersions\" /> One of the various changes for localization was the contents of Captain America's notebook list seen at the beginning of the film. The first five items were different depending on where the film was released, while the final five items were the same across all prints.<ref name=\"NotebookList\" /> Marvel held online polls allowing fans to select the items featured in each country's release.<ref name=\"NotebookFeaturette\" />\n\n==Music==\n{{main|Captain America: The Winter Soldier (soundtrack)}}\nIn June 2013, [[Henry Jackman]] announced that he would compose the film's [[Sheet music|score]].<ref name=\"Jackman\" /> About the score Jackman said, \"...it's 50% production and all the tricks I've learnt from spending years in the record industry but then it's also got the kind of injection of symphonic, thematic, heroic music that all kind of merges into one musical, and hopefully coherent piece\".<ref name=\"Jackman2\" /> A soundtrack album was released by [[Hollywood Records]] on April 1, 2014.<ref name=\"soundtrack\" />\n\n==Marketing==\nIn July 2013, Marvel Studios released a teaser poster depicting a damaged and discolored Captain America shield.<ref name=\"Teaser\" /> The ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' said, \"the image suggests that [Captain America] might see some serious battle in the sequel\" while ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' said, \"the image hints at darker themes in the sequel\".<ref name=\"LATimes2\" /><ref name=\"RollingStone\" /> Later that month, Marvel Studios head and producer Kevin Feige, directors Joe and Anthony Russo, and cast members Chris Evans, Scarlett Johansson, Samuel L.
