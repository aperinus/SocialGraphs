Randal Johnson]]  wrote it. The film stars [[Val Kilmer]] as lead singer and songwriter [[Jim Morrison]], [[Meg Ryan]] as [[Pamela Courson]] (Morrison's girlfriend), [[Kyle MacLachlan]] as keyboardist [[Ray Manzarek]], [[Frank Whaley]] as lead guitarist [[Robby Krieger]], [[Kevin Dillon (actor)|Kevin Dillon]] as drummer [[John Densmore]], [[Billy Idol]] as Cat and [[Kathleen Quinlan]] as journalist [[Patricia Kennealy-Morrison|Patricia Kennealy]]. The film tells the story and life of Jim Morrison, the lead singer of the American rock band [[the Doors]], and the band's success of their music and influential counterculture.\n\nThe film portrays Morrison as a larger-than-life icon of 1960s [[rock and roll]] and [[counterculture]], including portrayals of Morrison's [[recreational drug use]], [[free love]], [[hippie]] lifestyle, [[alcoholism]], interest in [[hallucinogen|hallucinogenic drugs]] as [[entheogen]]s, and, particularly, his growing [[fascination with death|obsession with death]], presented as threads which weave in and out of the film.\n\nReleased by [[TriStar Pictures|Tri-Star Pictures]] on March 1, 1991, ''The Doors'' grossed $34 million worldwide against its $32 million production budget and received mixed reviews from critics, audience and fans of the band alike. Kilmer's performance as Morrison was widely praised as well as the supporting cast, the cinematography, the production design and Stone's directing. However, it received backlash for its historical inaccuracy and how Morrison was portrayed.\n\n== Plot ==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, the plot summary should be 400-700 words. -->\nIn 1949, young [[Jim Morrison]] and his family are traveling on a desert highway in New Mexico where they encounter an auto wreck and see an elderly Native American dying by the roadside. In 1965, Jim arrives in California and is assimilated into the [[Venice, Los Angeles|Venice Beach]] culture. During his tenure studying at [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]], he meets [[Pamela Courson]] and they fall in love, becoming a couple. He also meets [[Ray Manzarek]] for the first time, as well as [[Robby Krieger]] and [[John Densmore]], all of whom form \"[[The Doors]]\" with Morrison.\n\nJim convinces his bandmates to travel to [[Death Valley]] and experience the effects of [[psychedelic drug]]s. Returning to Los Angeles, they play several shows at the famous [[Whisky a Go Go]] nightclub and develop a rabid fanbase. Jim's onstage antics and lewd performance of the group's song \"[[The End (The Doors song)|The End]]\" upset the club's owners, and the band is ejected from the venue. After the show, they are approached by producer [[Paul A. Rothchild]] and [[Jac Holzman]] of [[Elektra Records]] and are offered a deal to record their [[The Doors (album)|first album]]. The Doors are soon invited to perform on ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'', only to be told by one of the producers that they must change the lyric \"girl we couldn't get much higher\" in the song \"[[Light My Fire]]\", due to a reference to drugs. Despite this, Morrison performs the original lyric during the live broadcast and the band is not allowed to perform on the show again.\n\nAs the Doors' success continues, Jim becomes increasingly infatuated with his own image as \"The Lizard King\" and develops an addiction to alcohol and drugs. Jim meets [[Patricia Kennealy]], a rock journalist involved in [[witchcraft]], and participates in [[Mysticism|mystical]] ceremonies with her, including a [[Handfasting (Neopaganism)|handfasting]] ceremony. Meanwhile, an elder spirit watches these events.\n\nThe rest of the band grows weary of Jim's missed recording sessions and absences at concerts. Jim arrives late and intoxicated to a Miami, Florida concert, becoming increasingly confrontational towards the audience and allegedly exposing himself onstage. The incident is a low point for the band, resulting in criminal charges against Jim, cancellations of shows, breakdowns in Jim's personal relationships, and resentment from the other band members.\n\nIn 1970, following a lengthy trial, Jim is found guilty of [[indecent exposure]] and ordered to serve time in prison. However, he is allowed to remain free on bail, pending the results of an appeal. Patricia tells Jim that she is pregnant with his child, but Jim convinces her to have an abortion. Jim visits his bandmates for the final time, attending a birthday party hosted by Ray where he wishes the band luck in their future endeavors and gives each of them a copy of his poetry book ''[[An American Prayer]]''. As Jim plays in the front garden with the children, he sees that one of them is his childhood self and comments, \"This is the strangest life I've ever known\" (a lyric from the Doors song \"Waiting for the Sun\"), before passing out.\n\nIn 1971, Jim and Pam move to Paris, France to escape the pressures of the L.A. lifestyle. One evening, on July 3, 1971, Pam finds Jim dead in the bathtub of their apartment. The film's final scenes before the credits roll are of Jim's gravesite in [[P\u00e8re Lachaise Cemetery]] in Paris, while \"[[Adagio in G minor#In popular culture|A Feast of Friends]]\" ([[Adagio in G minor|Adagio]]) plays in the background. Just before the closing credits, the screen whites out and text appears stating that \"Jim is said to have died of [[heart failure]]. He was 27. Pam joined him three years later.\"\n\nDuring the closing credits, the band is shown recording the song \"[[L.A. Woman (song)|L.A. Woman]]\" in the studio.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{div col}}\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Val Kilmer]] as [[Jim Morrison]]\n* [[Kevin Dillon (actor)|Kevin Dillon]] as [[John Densmore]]\n* [[Kyle MacLachlan]] as [[Ray Manzarek]]\n* [[Kathleen Quinlan]] as [[Patricia Kennealy-Morrison|Patricia Kennealy]]\n* [[Meg Ryan]] as [[Pamela Courson]]\n* [[Frank Whaley]] as [[Robby Krieger]]\n* [[Josh Evans (film producer)|Josh Evans]] as [[Bill Siddons]]\n* [[Crispin Glover]] as [[Andy Warhol]]\n* [[Kelly Hu]] as Dorothy\n* [[Dennis Burkley]] as Dog\n* [[Billy Idol]] as Cat\n* [[Patricia Kennealy-Morrison]] as [[Celtic neopaganism|Celtic Pagan]] priestess\n* [[Michael Madsen]] as [[Tom Baker (American actor)|Tom Baker]]\n* [[Costas Mandylor]] as Italian Count\n* [[Debi Mazar]] as Whiskey girl\n* [[Mimi Rogers]] as Magazine photographer\n* [[Jennifer Rubin (actress)|Jennifer Rubin]] as [[Edie Sedgwick]]\n* Sean Stone as young Jim\n* Jerry Sturm and Gretchen Becker as Mr. and Mrs. Morrison\n* [[Floyd Westerman]] as a [[Spirit guide|Native American Spirit]]\n* [[Paul Williams (songwriter)|Paul Williams]] as Warhol [[Public relations|PR agent]]\n* [[Christina Fulton]] as [[Nico]]\n* [[Michael Wincott]] as [[Paul A.

Producer Sasha Harari wanted filmmaker Oliver Stone to write the screenplay but never heard back from his agent. After two unsatisfactory scripts were produced, Imagine Films replaced Columbia. Harari contacted Stone again and the director met with the surviving band members, telling them he wanted to keep a particularly wild scene from one of the early drafts. The group was offended by this and exercised their right of approval over the director, rejecting Stone.\n\nBy 1989, [[Mario Kassar]] and [[Andrew Vajna]], who owned [[Carolco Pictures]], had acquired the rights to the project and wanted Stone to direct it.{{sfn|Riordan|1996|p=308}} The Doors had seen Stone's film ''[[Platoon (film)|Platoon]]'' (1986) and were impressed with what he had done,{{sfn|Riordan|1996|p=310}} and Stone agreed to make the film after his next project, ''[[Evita (1996 film)#Oliver Stone: 1987\u20131994|Evita]]''. After spending years working on ''Evita'' and courting both [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] and [[Meryl Streep]] to play the titular role, the film fell apart over salary negotiations with Streep and Stone quickly moved into pre-production for ''The Doors''.{{sfn|Riordan|1996|p=310}}\n\nGuitarist Robby Krieger had always opposed a Doors biopic until Stone signed on to direct.<ref name=\"Mitchell\">{{cite news | last = Mitchell | first = Justin | title = Opening Up a Closed Door | newspaper = [[St. Petersburg Times]] | page =19 | date = December 28, 1990 }}</ref> Conversely, keyboardist Ray Manzarek had traditionally been the biggest advocate of immortalizing the band on film but opposed Stone's involvement.<ref name=\"Mitchell\"/> He was not happy with the direction that Stone was going to take with the film and refused to give his approval.

I didn't want Ray to be dominant, but Ray thought he knew better than anybody else\".{{sfn|Riordan|1996|p=312}} As Krieger revealed in his book ''Set the Night on Fire'', Manzarek was also jealous of Stone because he wanted to direct the film himself.{{sfn|Krieger|2021|pp=287\u2013288}}\n\n=== Screenplay ===\nStone first heard the Doors in 1967, when he was a 21-year-old soldier in [[Vietnam]].<ref name=\"McDonnell\">{{cite news | last = McDonnell | first = D. | title = Legendary Rocker Lives Again | newspaper = [[Herald Sun]] | page =27 | date = March 2, 1991 }}</ref> Before filming started, Stone and his producers had to negotiate with the three surviving band members and their label, [[Elektra Records]], as well as the parents of both Morrison and his girlfriend Pamela Courson. Morrison's parents would only allow themselves to be depicted in a dream-like flashback sequence at the beginning of the film. The Coursons wanted there to be no suggestion in any way that Pamela caused Morrison's death. Stone found the Coursons the most difficult to deal with because they wanted Pamela to be portrayed as \"an angel\".<ref name=\"McDonnell\"/> While researching the film, Stone read through transcripts of interviews with over 100 people.<ref name=\"Economist\">{{cite news | title = Oliver Stone and ''The Doors'' | newspaper = [[The Economist]] | date = March 16, 1991 }}</ref> Stone finally penned the film script in the summer of 1989, later stating that \"''The Doors'' script was always problematic. Even when we shot, but the music helped fuse it together\".{{sfn|Riordan|1996|p=311}} Stone first picked the songs he wanted to use and then wrote \"each piece of the movie as a mood to fit that song\".{{sfn|Riordan|1996|p=311}} The Coursons did not like Stone's script and tried to slow the production down by refusing to allow any of Morrison's later poetry to be used in the film. (When Morrison died, Courson acquired the rights to Morrison's poetry; when she died, her parents got the rights.){{sfn|Riordan|1996|p=311}}\n\n=== Casting ===\nFor nearly 10 years prior to production, the project went through [[development hell]] after being considered by many studios and directors. Several actors, including [[Tom Cruise]], [[Johnny Depp]], [[John Travolta]] and [[Richard Gere]], were each considered for the role of Morrison when the project was still in development in the 1980s,<ref name=\"McDonnell2\">{{cite news | last = McDonnell | first = D. | title = Rider on the Storm | newspaper = [[The Courier-Mail]] | date = March 16, 1991 }}</ref> with [[Bono]] of [[U2]] and [[Michael Hutchence]] of [[INXS]] also expressing interest in the role. Stone initially offered the role to [[Ian Astbury]] of [[the Cult]], who declined the role because he was not happy with the way Morrison was going to be represented in the film.{{sfn|Riordan|1996|p=308}}\n\nWhen Stone began talking about the project in 1988, he had Val Kilmer in mind to play Morrison, after seeing him in the [[Ron Howard]] fantasy film ''[[Willow (film)|Willow]]''.<ref name=\"McDonnell\"/><ref name=\"Green\">{{cite news | last = Green | first = Tom | title = Kilmer's Uncanny Portrait of Morrison Opens Career Doors | newspaper = [[USA Today]] | pages =4D | date = March 4, 1991 }}</ref> Kilmer had the same kind of singing voice as Morrison and, to convince Stone that he was right for the role, spent several thousand dollars of his own money and made his own eight-minute audition video, singing and looking like Morrison at various stages of his life.<ref name=\"Hall\">{{cite news | last = Hall | first = Carla | title = Val Kilmer, Lighting the Fire | newspaper = [[Washington Post]] | pages =G1 | date = March 3, 1991 }}</ref> To prepare for the role, Kilmer lost weight and spent six months rehearsing Doors songs every day; the actor learned 50 songs, 15 of which are actually performed in the film. Kilmer also spent hundreds of hours with the Doors' producer [[Paul A. Rothchild]], who related \"anecdotes, stories, tragic moments, humorous moments, how Jim thought{{nbsp}}... interpretation of Jim's lyrics\".<ref name=\"Hall\"/> Rothchild also took Kilmer into the studio and helped him with \"some pronunciations, idiomatic things that Jim would do that made the song sound like Jim\".<ref name=\"Hall\"/> Kilmer also met with Krieger and Densmore but Manzarek refused to talk to him.<ref name=\"Hall\"/> When the Doors heard Kilmer singing they could not tell whether the voice was Kilmer's or Morrison's.{{sfn|Riordan|1996|p=314}}\n\nStone auditioned approximately 60 actresses for the role of Pamela Courson.{{sfn|Riordan|1996|p=316}} The role required nudity and the script featured sex scenes, which generated a fair amount of controversy. Casting director Risa Bramon felt that [[Patricia Arquette]] auditioned very well and should have gotten the role.{{sfn|Riordan|1996|p=316}} To prepare for the role, Meg Ryan talked to the Coursons and people that knew Pamela.<ref name=\"McDonnell\"/> Before doing the film, she was not familiar with Morrison and \"liked a few songs\", adding, \"I had to reexamine all my beliefs about [the 1960s] in order to do this movie\".{{sfn|Riordan|1996|p=322}} In doing research, she also encountered several conflicting views of Pamela.{{sfn|Riordan|1996|p=316}}\n\nKrieger acted as a [[technical advisor]] on the film, chiefly to show his cinematic alter ego, Frank Whaley, where to put his fingers on the guitar [[fretboard]] during the [[Miming in instrumental performance|mimed]] performance sequences.<ref name=\"Mitchell\"/> Similarly, Densmore also acted as a consultant on the film, tutoring Kevin Dillon.<ref name=\"McDonnell2\"/>\n\n=== Principal photography ===\nWith a budget set at $32 million, ''The Doors'' was filmed over 13 weeks, predominantly in and around Los Angeles, California; Paris, France; [[New York City, New York]]; and the [[Mojave Desert]].<ref name=\"Broeske\"/>{{sfn|Riordan|1996|p=317}} Stone originally hired [[Paula Abdul]] to choreograph the film's concert scenes, who dropped out of the project because she did not understand Morrison's on-stage actions and was not familiar with the time period. Abdul recommended Bill and Jacqui Landrum, who watched hours of concert footage before working with Kilmer and got him to do dance exercises to loosen up his upper body and jumping routines to develop his stamina.<ref name=\"Thomas\">{{cite news | last = Thomas | first = Karen | title = Helping Stage ''The Doors'' | newspaper = USA Today | pages =2D | date = March 12, 1991 }}</ref>\n\nDuring the concert scenes, Kilmer did his own singing, performing over the Doors' master tapes without Morrison's lead vocals, avoiding [[lip-synching]].{{sfn|Riordan|1996|p=318}} Kilmer's endurance was put to the test during the concert sequences, which took several days to film, with Stone stating \"his voice would start to deteriorate after two or three takes.

An upset Stone contacted Kilmer's agent and the actor claimed it was all a huge misunderstanding and that the memo was for his own people and not the film crew.{{sfn|Riordan|1996|p=326}}\n\n=== Soundtrack ===\n{{Main|The Doors (soundtrack)}}\nThe film contains over two dozen of the Doors' songs, although only half of these appear on the accompanying [[The Doors (soundtrack)|soundtrack]] album. In the film, original recordings of the band are combined with vocal performances by Kilmer himself,<ref>{{cite web |first=Kevin |last=Burwick |url=https://movieweb.com/amp/the-doors-movie-1991-val-kilmer-rehearsal-video-jim-morrison/ |title=Val Kilmer Shares Rare Doors Movie Rehearsal Video |website= [[MovieWeb]] |date=June 14, 2017 |access-date=November 17, 2021}}</ref>  although none of Kilmer's performances appear on the soundtrack album.

Yeah!\" into the television camera.{{sfn|Goldsmith|Willson|Fonseca|2016|p=205}} However, during the actual broadcast, Morrison had simply sung the vocal with the same emphasis as on the record. Morrison later said the inclusion of \"higher\" in the live version was an accident, and that he had meant to change the lyric but was so nervous about performing on live television that he simply forgot to change it. Conversely, Ray Manzarek said the Doors only pretended to agree to the changing of words and deliberately played the song as they always had, albeit without any added emphasis on the offending words.{{sfn|Manzarek|1998|pp=251\u2013252}} Kilmer as Morrison is also shown wearing a black shirt in the scene, when in reality Morrison had wore a white shirt and black leather jacket for his performance on the show.\n\nAnother inaccuracy can be found in the character of a seductive female magazine photographer played by [[Mimi Rogers]], who appears to be based on ''[[16 (magazine)|16]]'' magazine editor [[Gloria Stavers]]. (The dialogue in this scene is based on a conversation Stavers had with Morrison during a photo session in her [[Manhattan]] apartment.){{sfn|Hopkins|Sugerman|1980|p={{page needed|date=July 2022}}}} This character is portrayed as having taken the famous \"young lion\" picture of Jim Morrison in New York City in 1967, when in fact this particular photograph (as well as nearly all the other publicity photographs for [[The Doors (album)|the Doors' first album]]) were taken by a male photographer, [[Joel Brodsky]], in Los Angeles in November 1966.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/arts/music/story/2007/04/02/joel-brodsky.html |title=Album Photographer Joel Brodsky Dies \u2013 Arts & Entertainment |date=April 2, 2007 |newspaper=[[CBC News]] |access-date=November 17, 2021}}</ref>\n\nSeveral acts of violence portrayed in the film are also disputed: Morrison is depicted as locking Pamela Courson in a closet and setting it on fire, which has been denied by people;<ref>{{cite magazine |first=Steven P. |last=Wheeler |title=A Conversation with Frank Lisciandro |magazine=ROKRITR.com |date=April 10, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |first=Patrick |last=Goldstein  |title=Ray Manzarek Slams 'The Doors' |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=March 7, 1991}}</ref> having a violent argument with Courson at a [[Thanksgiving]] celebration, where they both threaten each other with a knife; and angrily throwing a television set at Manzarek for licensing the use of \"Light My Fire\" in a [[Buick]] television commercial.<ref>{{cite web  |url=http://www.crystal-ship.com/entrevues.php?cht=03 |title=Chat with Ray Manzarek |date=November 17, 1997}}</ref> Even though Manzarek was frank about Morrison's tendency to go into senseless rages,{{sfn|Manzarek|1998|pp=180, 205-207, 305-308}} participants in the film agree that Stone took many liberties in fabricating events and that none of these incidents actually occurred.

Similarly, in an earlier scene of a press conference set in New York City in 1967, when Kennealy is first introduced to Morrison, the singer is asked a question regarding \"the dreadful reviews your new poetry book has received\"; at that time, Morrison had not yet published any volumes of his poetry.{{citation needed|date=May 2021}}\n\nJohn Densmore is portrayed as hating Morrison when the singer's personal and drug problems begin to dominate his behavior. However, Densmore states in his biography ''Riders on the Storm'' that he never directly confronted Morrison about his behavior.{{sfn|Densmore|1991|p=268}} Other questionable portrayals include those of [[Andy Warhol]], who is presented as a leering homosexual caricature.{{citation needed|date=May 2021}}\n\nKrieger, Densmore and Kennealy are all credited as technical advisors for the film; however, they have all commented that, although they may have given advice, Stone often chose to ignore it in favor of his own vision of the story. The settings for the film, particularly the concert sequences, are depicted in mostly chronological order, although the crowd scenes contain many blatant exaggerations, such as portrayals of public nudity, bonfires, and group revelries that did not occur.<ref>{{cite magazine |first=Alex von |last=Tunzelmann |date=February 17, 2011 |title=Oliver Stone's The Doors: a flash in the pan that won't light anyone's fire |url=https://amp.theguardian.com/film/2011/feb/17/reel-history-oliver-stone-the-doors |magazine=[[The Guardian]] |access-date=November 18, 2021}}</ref> For example, in the concert sequences naked women are shown prancing around onstage, when in reality Densmore said that didn't happen in any of the Doors' concerts.<ref>{{cite magazine |first=Jim |last=Clash |date=January 25, 2015 |title=Doors Drummer John Densmore On Oliver Stone, Cream's Ginger Baker (Part 3) |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/jimclash/2015/01/25/doors-drummer-john-densmore-on-oliver-stone-creams-ginger-baker-part-3/amp/\n|magazine=[[Forbes]] |access-date=July 9, 2022}}</ref>\n\nIn the film's climactic scene of the infamous concert at the [[Dinner Key Auditorium]] in [[Miami]] on March 1, 1969, Morrison is shown as leaving the stage to join the audience for a singalong medley of \"Break on Through\" and \"Dead Cats, Dead Rats\", a portrayal which is likewise exaggerated and inaccurate. Previously in the scene, Morrison is also heard shouting to the audience \"You're all bunch of fucking slaves!\" but in reality he actually said \"You're bunch of fucking idiots!\",{{sfn|Welsh|Walkey|2013|p=155}} although he did call the audience \"slaves\" later in his rant.<ref>{{cite AV media |medium=Amateur Audience Recording |title=Dinner Key Auditorium |location=Miami, Florida |date=March 1, 1969}}</ref>  Also, prior to the concert, a reporter on the scene makes a derogatory comment about the band's fourth studio album, ''[[The Soft Parade]]'', which had not yet been completed and would not be released until July of that year.{{citation needed|date=May 2021}} Additionally, Krieger said that he didn't take acid prior to the start of the concert as depicted in the film.<ref>{{cite news |first=Steve |last=Knopper |date=April 15, 1991 |title=Ex-Doors Disagree on Oliver Stone Film |newspaper=[[Knight Ridder]]}}</ref>\n\nThe surviving Doors members were all, to one degree or another, unhappy with the final film, and were said to have heavily criticized Stone's portrayal of Morrison as an \"out of control [[antisocial personality disorder|sociopath]].\" In a 1991 interview with Gary James, Manzarek criticized Stone for exaggerating Morrison's alcohol consumption in the movie: \"Jim with a bottle all the time. It was ridiculous{{nbsp}}... It was not about Jim Morrison. It was about Jimbo Morrison, the drunk. God, where was the sensitive poet and the funny guy? The guy I knew was not on that screen.\"<ref>[http://www.classicbands.com/RayManzarekInterview.html Interview with Ray Manzarek at Classic Bands]</ref> In the afterword of his book ''Riders on the Storm'', Densmore says that the movie is based on \"the myth of Jim Morrison\" and criticizes the film for portraying Morrison's ideas as \"muddled through the haze of the drink [alcohol].\"{{sfn|Densmore|1991|p=Afterword}} In a 1994 interview, Krieger said that the film doesn't give the viewer \"any kind of understanding of what made Jim Morrison tick.\" Krieger added, \"They left a lot of stuff out. Some of it was overblown, but a lot of the stuff was very well done, I thought.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.classicbands.com/RobbyKriegerInterview.html |title=Interview With Robby Krieger |website=Classicbands.com |access-date=2014-05-19}}</ref>\n\nIn Manzarek's biography of the Doors, ''Light My Fire'', he often criticizes Stone and also includes myriad details that discredit Stone's account of Morrison. For example, in Stone's \"re-creation\" of Morrison's student film at UCLA, he has Morrison watching a [[Normandy landings|D-Day]] sequence on television and shouting profanities in [[German language|German]], with a near-nude [[Germans|German]] exchange student dancing on top of the television sporting a [[swastika]] armband. According to Manzarek, the only similarity between Stone's version and Morrison's was that the girl in question was indeed German.{{sfn|Manzarek|1998|pp=55-57}} Furthermore, Manzarek described Stone's version as a \"grotesque exaggeration\", and recalled that Morrison's film was actually a \"much lighter, much friendlier, much funnier kind of thing.\"{{sfn|Manzarek|1998|pp=55-57}}\n\nAs the credits point out and as Stone emphasizes in his DVD commentary, some characters, names, and incidents in the film are fictitious or amalgamations of real people.<ref name=dvd/> In the [[1997 in film|1997]] [[documentary film|documentary]], ''The Road of Excess'', Stone states that Quinlan's character, Patricia Kennealy, is a composite, and in retrospect should have been given a fictitious name.<ref>{{cite AV media | first =Charles | last =Kiselyak | year =1997 | title =The Road of Excess | type =documentary}}</ref> Kennealy in particular was hurt by her portrayal in the film and strongly objected to a scene in the film where Morrison states that he did not take their handfasting ceremony seriously. In addition, Kennealy is credited as a [[Wiccan]] priestess for her cameo role, when in reality her appearance in the marriage involved into [[Celtic paganism]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Kennealy |first=Patricia |year=1998 |title=Blackmantle - A Book of The Keltiad |location=New York |publisher=HarperPrism |isbn=0-06-105610-3}}</ref>\n\nRyan's character, Pamela Courson, involves liberties of a different sort. The former Doors think the movie depiction of her is not accurate at all, as their book ''The Doors'' describes this version of Courson as \"a cartoon of a girlfriend\".{{sfn|Fong-Torres|The Doors|p=232}} Courson's parents had inherited Morrison's poems when their daughter died, and Stone had to agree to restrictions about his portrayal of her in exchange for the rights to use the poetry. In particular, Stone agreed to avoid any suggestion that Courson may have been responsible for Morrison's death.<ref>{{cite news |first=Pat H. |last=Broeske |date=January 7, 1990 |title=Jim Morrison: Back to the Sixties Darkly |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]}}</ref> However, Alain Ronay and Courson herself had both said that she was responsible. In ''Riders on the Storm'', Densmore says Courson said she felt terribly guilty because she had obtained drugs that she believed had either caused or contributed to Morrison's death.{{sfn|Densmore|1991|p={{page needed|date=November 2021}}}}\n\n== Release and reception ==\n''The Doors'' was entered into the [[17th Moscow International Film Festival]].<ref name=\"Moscow1991\">{{cite web |url=http://www.moscowfilmfestival.ru/miff34/eng/archives/?year=1991 |title=17th Moscow International Film Festival (1991) |access-date=2013-03-02 |work=MIFF |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140403102003/http://www.moscowfilmfestival.ru/miff34/eng/archives/?year=1991 |archive-date=2014-04-03}}</ref> In April 2019, a restored version of the film was selected to be shown in the Cannes Classics section at the [[2019 Cannes Film Festival]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Cannes Classics 2019 |url=https://www.festival-cannes.com/en/press/press-articles/communique/articles/cannes-classics-2019-1 |website=Festival de Cannes |access-date=26 April 2019 |date=26 April 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn a contemporary review, [[Roger Ebert]] gave ''The Doors'' two-and-a-half out of four stars.
