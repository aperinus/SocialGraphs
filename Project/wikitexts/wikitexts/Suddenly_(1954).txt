Claiming to be [[FBI]] agents checking up on security before the president\u2019s arrival, three men arrive at the home of the Bensons: Ellen, a widow, her young son \u201cPidge,\u201d and her father-in-law, \u201cPop\u201d Benson.  The house is on top of a hill that looks down on the station where the presidential train is scheduled to stop, making it a perfect perch from which to shoot the president when his train stops. However, it soon becomes clear that the men are not Government agents but assassins, led by the ruthless John Baron, who take over the house and hold the family hostage, planning to shoot the president from a window in the home which has a good view of the railway station.\n\nSheriff Tod Shaw arrives with Dan Carney, the [[United States Secret Service|Secret Service]] agent in charge of the president's security detail. When he does, Baron and his gangsters shoot Carney dead and a bullet fractures Shaw's left arm. Baron straightens his arm and lets him go to the bedroom. Mrs Benson puts his arm in a sling and they all return to watch the events unfold.\n\nBaron boasts about the Silver Star he won in the war for killing 16 Japs. (He later changes the story to killing 27 Jerries.) They set up a [[Gewehr 43|G/K.43]] service rifle at the window, secured to a metal table. Baron explains he has nothing against the president but he is being paid $500,000 to kill him and money is his only motive. He has been paid half up front.\n\nPop broke the TV earlier and the TV repair man arrives amid the scene. All are threatened that the kid will be shot if they do not obey.\n\nBaron sends Benny, one of his two henchmen, to check on the president's schedule, but shortly after confirming to Baron that the train is scheduled to stop in Suddenly at 5 p.m., Benny is killed in a shootout with the police. Meanwhile, Jud, a television repairman, has shown up at the house and also becomes a hostage. Pidge goes to his grandfather's dresser to get some medication and notices a fully loaded revolver which he replaces with his toy cap gun.\n[[File:Suddenly (1954).webm|thumb|thumbtime=60|upright=1.3|''Suddenly'']]\nWhen the hostages try to appeal to Baron\u2019s patriotism, it becomes clear that he has none: he has been hired to kill the president for money. But when Baron is confronted by the sheriff on the risks of killing the president, including whether he will ever see (let alone live to enjoy) his money, Baron's remaining henchman begins to show some reluctance to go through with the assassination. For Baron, however, these are the very least of his concerns, and it soon becomes clear that he is a psychopath whose pleasure comes from killing{{spaced ndash}}who he kills and for what reason being of little importance to him.\n\nIn the meantime, the assassins have mounted a WWII German sniper rifle onto a metal table by the window overlooking the train station. Jud, under the guise of fixing the TV, discreetly hooks the table up to the 5000-volt plate output of the family television. Pop Benson then intentionally spills a cup of water on the floor beneath the table. Although the hope is that Baron will be shocked and killed in this way, it is his remaining henchman who touches the table first and is electrocuted, reflexively firing the rifle repeatedly and attracting the attention of police at the train station. Baron shoots and mortally wounds Jud, disconnects the electrical hook-up and aims the rifle as the president's train arrives at the station, only to see the train pass straight through. As an utterly surprised Baron says \u201c[i]t didn\u2019t stop,\u201d Ellen Benson shoots Baron in the abdomen, and Shaw picks up a gun and shoots him a second time. Baron, having dropped to the floor, begs for mercy \u2014\u2014 \"No, don't...no, please...no, no, no\" \u2014\u2014 and dies.\n\nIn the aftermath of the harrowing incident, outside the local hospital Shaw confirms to Ellen that Jud \u201cdidn\u2019t make it.\u201d Telling Ellen that he needs to go back to his office, Shaw then makes plans to meet Ellen after church the next day, and they kiss. After she leaves, a driver stops to ask for directions and then asks for the name of the town.  When Shaw says it is \u201cSuddenly,\u201d the driver notes that \u201cthat\u2019s a funny name for a town.\u201d After the driver pulls away, Shaw says to himself, \"Oh, I don't know. I don't know about that.\"\n\n==Cast==\n{{col-begin|width=80%}}{{col-break}}\n* [[Frank Sinatra]] as John Baron\n* [[Sterling Hayden]] as Sheriff Tod Shaw\n* [[James Gleason]]  as Peter \"Pop\" Benson\n* [[Nancy Gates]] as Ellen Benson\n* Kim Charney as Peter \"Pidge\" Benson III\n* [[Willis Bouchey]] as Dan Carney, Chief Secret Service Agent\n* [[Paul Frees]] as Benny Conklin (also voice of TV announcer)\n* [[Christopher Dark]] as Bart Wheeler\n* [[James O'Hara (actor)|James O'Hara]] as Jud Hobson (credited as James Lilburn)\n* Ken Dibbs as Wilson\n{{col-break}}\n* [[Clark Howat]] as Haggerty\n* [[Charles Smith (actor)|Charles Smith]] as Bebop\n* [[Paul Wexler (actor)|Paul Wexler]] as Deputy Sheriff Slim Adams\n* [[Dan White (actor)|Dan White]] as Burg\n* Richard Collier as Ed Hawkins\n* [[Roy Engel]] as first driver\n* Ted Stanhope as second driver\n* Charles Wagenheim as Kaplan\n* [[John Berardino]] as trooper\n{{col-end}}\n\n===Cast notes===\n* Frank Sinatra's role in ''Suddenly'' was the first occasion on which he was cast as a \"heavy\" in a dramatic film.<ref name=tcmart />\n* Actor [[Paul Frees]], who plays one of Sinatra's henchmen, is best known for his voiceover work, such as for the character [[Boris Badunov]] in the ''[[Rocky and Bullwinkle]]'' cartoons.\n\n==Production==\nWriter Richard Sale got his idea for the short story that was the basis of the film from articles in the newspaper about [[President Dwight D. Eisenhower]]'s visits to Palm Springs, California, by train.<ref name=tcmart /> There were differences between the story and the film, the most thematically important being that the mother in the story was not bitter about her husband's death in World War II, and in fact, was not present during the assassination attempt,<ref name=afi /> so never had to make the choice the mother in the film has to make: whether to shoot and kill the assassin when the opportunity arises.\n\nThe exterior scenes for ''Suddenly'' were filmed in [[Saugus, California]], which is now part of the city of [[Santa Clarita]].<ref name=afi /> Saugus Railway Station, which features  prominently, still exists, though not in its original location. At the time of filming Saugus was served by a spur line that branched off from the main Southern Pacific coast line, terminating at [[Ventura, California|Ventura]]. The spur line operated for almost a century but was decommissioned and torn up during the 1970s. Saugus station closed permanently in 1978, but local residents saved the historic building (opened in 1888) and had it moved to a new location, where it now serves as a museum. The building was subsequently also used as a location in the 1990 film ''[[The Grifters (film)|The Grifters]]'', starring [[Angelica Huston]] and [[John Cusack]].\n\nThe production company, Libra Productions, was producer Robert Brassler's company, and ''Suddenly'' was his first independent film. Previously, Brassler had worked for [[Twentieth Century Fox]].<ref name=afi />\n\n[[File:Sterling Hayden in the movie &quot;Suddenly&quot;.jpg|thumb|left|275px|Sterling Hayden as Sheriff Tod Shaw]]\n\n==Reception==\n[[Image:Suddenlyimage109.jpg|thumb|right|325px|Frank Sinatra as John Baron, berating a hostage.]]\n\nWhen the film was released, [[Bosley Crowther]], film critic for ''[[The New York Times]]'', liked the direction of the film and the acting, and writing \"Yet such is the role that Mr. Sinatra plays in ''Suddenly!'', a taut little melodrama that... [it] shapes up as one of the slickest recent items in the minor movie league... we have several people to thank\u2014particularly Richard Sale for a good script, which tells a straight story credibly, Mr. Allen for direction that makes both excitement and sense, Mr. Bassler for a production that gets the feel of a small town and the cast which includes Sterling Hayden, James Gleason and Nancy Gates.\" Crowther especially liked Sinatra's performance. He wrote, \"Mr. Sinatra deserves a special chunk of praise...In ''Suddenly!'' he proves it in a melodramatic tour de force.\"<ref>[[Bosley Crowther|Crowther, Bosley]] (October 8, 1954) [https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?_r=1&res=9802E6D8103FE33BBC4053DFB667838F649EDE&oref=slogin \"Film review: Suddenly\"]. ''[[The New York Times]]''</ref>\n\nThe staff reviewer at ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' gave the film a good review and praised the acting. He wrote \"[Sinatra] inserts plenty of menace into a psycho character, never too heavily done, and gets good backing from his costar, Sterling Hayden, as sheriff, in a less showy role but just as authoritatively handled. Lewis Allen's direction manages a smart piece where static treatment easily could have prevailed.\"<ref>Staff (January 1, 1954) [https://www.variety.com/review/VE1117795305.html?categoryid=31&cs=1&p=0 \"Suddenly\" (review)], ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]''</ref>\n\nThe reviewer for ''[[Newsweek]]'' wrote about Sinatra's performance that he \"superbly refutes the idea that the straight-role potentialities which earned an Academy Award for him in ''[[From Here to Eternity]]'' were one-shot stuff. In ''Suddenly'', the happy-go-lucky soldier of ''Eternity'' becomes one of the most repellent killers in American screen history.\"<ref name=tcmart/> Film critic Carl Mazek  in ''Film Noir: An Encyclopedic Reference to the American Style'' (1982) makes the case that the \"Machiavellian attitude\" of John Baron links the picture with the brutal films noir of the 1950s like ''[[The Big Night (1951 film)|The Big Night]]'' (1951) and ''[[Kiss Me Deadly]]'' (1955).<ref name=\"SilverWard\">Silver and Ward (1982), p. 275</ref> Moreover, he continued:\n<blockquote>The sense of claustrophobia and despair unleashed by the assassins in ''Suddenly'' is completely amoral, and totally opposite of the style of harassment found in such non-noir, socially redemptive films as ''The Desperate Hours'' [1955]...There are no reasons given, or asked for, regarding the assassination \u2014 the entire incident functions as a nightmare, a very real nightmare that invades the serenity of a small town. At the end of the film, it is apparent that the Benson family will never be the same, suddenly scarred by people out of nowhere who irrevocably disrupt their middle-class tranquility.<ref name=tcmart /><ref name=\"SilverWard\"/></blockquote>\n\nOn [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film holds a contemporary approval rating of 100% based on nine reviews, with an average rating of 6.78/10.<ref>{{cite web|title=Suddenly (1954)|url= https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1020415_suddenly |website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|access-date=June 22, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n===Influence===\n\nIn 1959, five years after the release of ''Suddenly'', ''[[The Manchurian Candidate]]'', a novel written by [[Richard Condon]], a former Hollywood press agent, was published. As with ''Suddenly'', Condon's book features a mentally troubled former war hero who, at the climax of the story, uses a rifle with a scope to shoot at a politician, in the case of the novel, a presidential candidate. ''The Manchurian Candidate'' was released as [[The Manchurian Candidate (1962 film)|a film in 1962]], starring Sinatra, but this time he was trying to prevent an assassination being committed by [[Laurence Harvey]].<ref name=tcmart /> Paul Frees, who plays Benny Conklin in ''Suddenly'', served as the narrator of ''The Manchurian Candidate'' (1962).\n\nSinatra asked United Artists to withdraw ''Suddenly'' from circulation because he heard the rumor that [[Lee Harvey Oswald]] had seen it before [[Assassination of John F.
