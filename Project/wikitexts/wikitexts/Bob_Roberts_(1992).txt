Roberts is well financed, due mainly to past business dealings, and is well known for his [[folk music]], which presents conservative ideas with gusto.\n\nThe film is Robbins' directorial debut, and is based on a short segment of the same title and featuring the same character that Robbins portrayed on ''[[Saturday Night Live]].''<ref>[https://www.allmovie.com/movie/bob-roberts-v6418 AllMovie]</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n''Bob Roberts'' takes place in Pennsylvania in 1990. It depicts a fictitious senatorial race between a [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] folk singer, Bob Roberts, and the incumbent [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]], Brickley Paiste. The film is shot through the perspective of Terry Manchester, a British documentary filmmaker who is following the Roberts campaign. Through his lens we see Roberts travel across the state, performing songs about drug users, lazy people and the triumph of traditional family values over the rebelliousness of the 1960s. As the campaign continues, Paiste remains in the lead until a scandal arises involving him and a young woman who was seen emerging from a car with him. Paiste claims that she was a friend of his granddaughter whom he was driving home, but he cannot shake the accusations.\n\nThroughout the campaign, reporter Bugs Raplin attempts to use the documentary being made about Roberts as a way to expose him to the public as a fraud. Raplin believes that Roberts' anti-drug charity, Broken Dove, is connected to an old [[Allegations of CIA drug trafficking|CIA drug trafficking scheme]]. As the election approaches, Roberts is asked to appear on a network's sketch comedy show. When Roberts announces that he will not be playing the song he had originally proposed, a dispute breaks out between the cast and producers of the show. This new song turns out to be nothing more than a thinly veiled campaign endorsement, and an angry staff member of the network pulls the plug mid-performance. As Roberts is leaving the studio, he is seemingly shot by a would-be assassin. Raplin, who has been causing problems for the campaign, is initially linked to the shooting, but he is later cleared when it is found that due to constrictive [[:wikt:palsy|palsy]] in his right hand he physically could not have fired the gun. Following the incident, Raplin contends that Roberts was never actually shot and that the gun was fired into the ground.\n\nThe campaign is boosted by public support following the assassination attempt, and Roberts wins the election with 52 percent of the vote. Although Roberts claims that his wounds have left him paralyzed from the waist down, he is seen tapping his feet at a celebration party. While Terry Manchester is interviewing Roberts' supporters outside the new senator's hotel, a boy runs up shouting, \"He's dead, he's dead, they got him!\" When Manchester asks him what he is talking about, the boy shouts, \"Bugs Raplin! He's dead! They got him!\" A joyful celebration breaks out among Roberts' supporters, the shot changes to an image of his hotel room, and an upright walking shadow suggesting Roberts' profile passes the window before the lights go out. The film ends with a radio news report about Raplin's death at the hands of a [[right-wing politics|right-wing]] fanatic and a shot of Manchester standing in the [[Jefferson Memorial]], looking at the words, \"I have sworn upon the altar of God eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over the mind of man\", inscribed there.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Tim Robbins]] as Robert \"Bob\" Roberts Jr., a folksinger and businessman who runs for the U.S. Senate\n* [[Giancarlo Esposito]] as John Alijah \"Bugs\" Raplin, a journalist determined to expose Roberts \n* [[Ray Wise]] as Chet MacGregor, Roberts' campaign manager\n* [[Gore Vidal]] as Senator Brickley Paiste, the incumbent Senator against whom Roberts campaigns\n* [[John Cusack]] as ''Cutting Edge Live'' host \n* [[Peter Gallagher]] as Dan Riley, host of ''Good Morning, Philadelphia''\n* [[Alan Rickman]] as Lukas Hart III, Roberts' campaign chairman\n* [[Susan Sarandon]] as Tawna Titan, a local news anchor for WFAC-TV News\n* [[James Spader]] as Chuck Marlin, a local news anchor for station WLNO\n* [[Fred Ward]] as Chip Daley, co-anchor at WFAC-TV News\n* [[Brian Murray (actor)|Brian Murray]] as Terry Manchester, a British [[documentary film]]-maker\n* [[Rebecca Jenkins]] as Delores Perrigrew, a member of Roberts' campaign staff\n* [[Harry Lennix]] as Franklin Dockett, a Roberts campaign aide\n* [[Robert Stanton (actor)|Robert Stanton]] as Bart Macklerooney, a Roberts campaign aide\n* [[Kelly Willis]] as Clarissa Flan, a folk musician and Miss Broken Dove 1989\n* [[Tom Atkins (actor)|Tom Atkins]] as Dr. Caleb Menck, Roberts' personal doctor\n* [[David Strathairn]] as Mack Laflin, Raplin's attorney\n* [[Pamela Reed]] as Carol Cruise, Chuck Marlin's co-anchor at WLNO\n* [[Helen Hunt]] as Rose Pondell, a field reporter at WLNO\n* [[Lynne Thigpen]] as Kelly Noble, an interviewer on ''Good Morning, Philadelphia''\n* [[Bingo O'Malley]] as Robert Roberts, Sr.\n* [[Kathleen Chalfant]] as Constance Roberts, Bob Roberts' mother\n* [[Matt McGrath (actor)|Matt McGrath]] as Burt, a friend and bandmate of Davis\n* [[Jack Black]] as Roger Davis, a fan of Roberts' music and politics (film debut)\n* [[Anita Gillette]] as Mrs. Davis, wife of the mayor of Harrisburg, mother of Roger\n* [[Fisher Stevens]] as Rock Bork, a field reporter at WFAC-TV News\n* [[Bob Balaban]] as Michael Janes, ''Cutting Edge Live'' producer\n* [[Allan F.

Not only does Roberts' character draw from 1960s-era iconography of [[Bob Dylan]], it also contains scenes inspired by the 1967 documentary, ''[[Dont Look Back]]''<!-- sic -->, made about the singer, employing a similar [[cinema verit\u00e9]] style.<ref>Ansen, D.

(1992) \"Tim Robbins campaigns for Bob Roberts and political change (interview).\" ''The Tech.'' 112 (44) pg. 8</ref> and directly references this during the scene in which Roberts gets lost in an auditorium attempting to find the stage before his performance. In the case of [[Gore Vidal]]'s character, the majority of the lines were not scripted, and instead Vidal based his role upon his own political beliefs, and his real-life positions on many of the fictional election topics.<ref>Johnson, B.

W. Bush]] and Pennsylvania senator [[Rick Santorum]], Robbins has said that the film related more to the political system in general than any specific politician. Much of Robbins' commentary addresses the role of the media in election campaigns.<ref>Roberge, C. (1992) Tim Robbins campaigns for Bob Roberts and political change (interview).
