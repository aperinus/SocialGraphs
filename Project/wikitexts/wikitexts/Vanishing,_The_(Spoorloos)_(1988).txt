It stars [[Gene Bervoets]] as a man who searches obsessively for his girlfriend following her disappearance at a [[rest area]].\n\n''The Vanishing'' was released on 27 October 1988, and received positive reviews. Sluizer [[The Vanishing (1993 film)|remade the film]] in English in 1993; the remake was poorly received.<ref name=\"RT1993\">{{cite web |url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1042295-vanishing/ |title=The Vanishing (1993) |access-date=2008-08-10 |publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] }}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nA young Dutch couple, Rex and Saskia, are on holiday in France. As they drive, Saskia shares a recurring dream in which she is drifting through space in a golden egg. In the most recent dream, another egg containing another person appeared; she feels the collision of the two eggs would signify the end of something.\n\nTheir car runs out of petrol and they stop at a [[rest area]], where a man in another car dons a false sling and [[orthopedic cast]]. Rex promises to never abandon Saskia and they bury two coins at the base of a tree as a symbol of their romance. Saskia enters the petrol station to buy drinks and does not return. Rex frantically searches for her.\n\nSome time earlier, Raymond, a wealthy family man, secretly plots to abduct a woman. He buys an isolated house, experiments with [[chloroform]], and rehearses methods of enticing women into his car. When his initial attempts at abduction fail, he poses as an injured motorist in need of assistance and goes to the rest area out of town, where he will not be recognised.\n\nThree years after Saskia's disappearance, Rex is still searching for her. He has received several postcards inviting him to meet the kidnapper at a cafe in [[N\u00eemes]], but the kidnapper never comes. Unknown to Rex, the cafe is directly opposite Raymond's apartment, where he watches Rex wait. Rex's new girlfriend, Lieneke, reluctantly helps him search for Saskia. One day, Rex has a dream similar to Saskia's in which he is trapped in a golden egg. Unable to endure his obsession, Lieneke leaves him.\n\nRex makes a public appeal on television, saying he only wants to know the truth about what happened to Saskia. Raymond confronts Rex and admits to the kidnapping; he says he will reveal what happened to her if Rex comes with him. As they drive, Raymond says he has known from a young age that he has no conscience, and is therefore capable of anything. After saving a young girl from drowning, he resolved to commit the worst crime he could imagine in order to test if he was worthy of his daughter's admiration; in his view, one can only be a truly good person if one is capable of doing something evil, but chooses not to do it. He describes how he kidnapped Saskia at the rest stop by posing as a traveling salesman and enticing her into his car.\n\nRaymond takes Rex to the rest area. He dismisses Rex's threats of police action, saying there is no evidence connecting him to the crime. Pouring a cup of drugged coffee, Raymond tells Rex the only way to learn what happened to Saskia is to experience it himself. As Raymond waits in the car, Rex rages, unsure of what to do. After digging up the coins he and Saskia buried years earlier, he drinks the coffee and [[Premature burial|awakens buried in a box underground]].\n\nOn a sunny day, Raymond relaxes at his country home, surrounded by his wife and children. A newspaper sitting in his car features a headline about the double disappearance of Saskia and Rex.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Bernard-Pierre Donnadieu]] as Raymond Lemorne (his surname means 'the gloomy one'), a French chemistry professor, who in his teens realized he was a [[antisocial personality disorder|sociopath]]. To prove to himself that he is capable of \"the ultimate [[evil]]\", he decides to kidnap and murder a young woman.\n*[[Gene Bervoets]] as Rex Hofman, a Dutch traveler on a holiday with his girlfriend Saskia Wagter in France. Three years after Saskia vanishes at a service station, Rex is still searching for her, obsessed with finding out what happened to her.\n*[[Johanna ter Steege]] as Saskia Wagter, Rex's Dutch girlfriend who travels with him through France until she goes missing at a service station.\n*Gwen Eckhaus as Lieneke, whom Rex is dating three years after Saskia's disappearance.\n*Bernadette Le Sach\u00e9 as Simone Lemorne, Raymond's wife. Like the rest of her family, she is completely unaware of Raymond's crime.\n*Tania Latarjet as Denise Lemorne, the elder daughter of Simone and Raymond.\n*Lucille Glenn as Gabrielle Lemorne, the younger daughter of Simone and Raymond.\n\n==Production==\n===Writing===\nBefore working on ''The Vanishing'', Sluizer became familiar with journalist [[Tim Krabb\u00e9]] through his articles about filmmaking in the United States.{{sfn|Sluizer|2014|loc=0:00:23}} These articles eventually became a novel, which Sluizer adapted into his film ''Red Desert Penitentiary'' (1985).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://explore.bfi.org.uk/4ce2b7600be69|publisher=[[British Film Institute]]|access-date=September 4, 2015|title=Red Desert Penitentiary}}{{dead link|date=July 2020|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>{{sfn|Sluizer|2014|loc=0:00:41}} After ''Red Desert Penitentiary'', Krabb\u00e9 began writing a novel called ''Het Gouden Ei'' ({{Literal translation}} ''[[The Golden Egg]]'').{{sfn|Sluizer|2014|loc=0:00:51}} As the film was set in France, Krabb\u00e9 asked Sluizer about names of towns, and Sluizer advised him on town names as well as family names.{{sfn|Sluizer|2014|loc=0:01:02}} Sluizer had access to the early manuscripts of the novel, and after reading the first few chapters he stated that he wanted to buy the film rights.{{sfn|Sluizer|2014|loc=0:01:21}}\n\nKrabb\u00e9 initially offered to write the script for Sluizer after he had finished the book.{{sfn|Sluizer|2014|loc=0:01:35}} Sluizer described the script's first draft as \"not bad, but not good\" and wrote the second draft with Krabb\u00e9.{{sfn|Sluizer|2014|loc=0:01:45}} The two worked on a third draft together, and Sluizer stated they began to have what he described as a \"difference of opinion\" over what should happen in the film, the placing of scenes, and how to dramatically tell the story.{{sfn|Sluizer|2014|loc=0:01:51}} Sluizer stopped working with Krabb\u00e9, stating that he had bought the film rights and he would finish the script himself, which angered Krabb\u00e9.{{sfn|Sluizer|2014|loc=0:02:25}} The completed film accurately portrays the narrative within the novel, apart from two factors: first, the film's narrative is more complicated than that of the novel, making extensive use of flashbacks and gradually revealing personality traits of the central characters;{{sfn|Mathijs|2004|p=178}} and, second, Rex and Raymond spend more time together following their meeting in the film than they do in the novel.{{sfn|Mathijs|2004|p=178}}\n\n===Casting===\nA casting agent suggested Sluizer see [[Johanna ter Steege]], who was in a student play, for the role of Saskia Wagter.{{sfn|Sluizer|2014|loc=0:02:44}} When Sluizer saw that Steege's hair was a similar color to his daughter's, he decided she would be right for the character.{{sfn|Sluizer|2014|loc=0:03:20}}\n\nFor the role of Rex, there was a choice between two actors: a Dutch actor and Belgian actor [[Gene Bervoets]].{{sfn|Sluizer|2014|loc=0:04:05}} Sluizer chose Bervoets because his French was stronger, but later felt unsure he had chosen the right actor, which led him to have a slightly uncomfortable relationship with Bervoets on set.{{sfn|Sluizer|2014|loc=0:04:40}}\n\n[[Jean-Louis Trintignant]] was Sluizer's initial choice for the role of Raymond Lemorne, but he was unavailable.{{sfn|Sluizer|2014|loc=0:05:38}} After thinking about other French actors who could play the part, Sluizer thought of [[Bernard-Pierre Donnadieu]], who had a small role in his film ''Twice a Woman'' (1979).{{sfn|Sluizer|2014|loc=0:05:55}} Sluizer discovered Donnadieu had worked in television and had leading roles in films since appearing in ''Twice a Woman'' and got him signed to play Raymond.{{sfn|Sluizer|2014|loc=0:06:45}}\n\n==Release==\n[[File:Johanna ter Steege.jpg|thumb|right|Johanna ter Steege (shown here in 2008) won a [[European Film Awards|European Film Award]] for Best Supporting Actress for her role in ''The Vanishing''.<ref name=\"SaskiaAward\" />]]\n''The Vanishing'' was released in the Netherlands on 27 October 1988.<ref>{{cite book|title=Dutch Film 1987-1988|year=1988|publisher=The Hague: Government Pub.
