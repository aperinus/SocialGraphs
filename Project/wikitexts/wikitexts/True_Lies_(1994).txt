It stars [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]], [[Jamie Lee Curtis]], [[Tom Arnold (actor)|Tom Arnold]], [[Art Malik]], [[Tia Carrere]], [[Bill Paxton]], [[Eliza Dushku]], [[Grant Heslov]] and [[Charlton Heston]]. It is based on the 1991 French [[comedy film]] ''[[La Totale!]]''<ref name=EGM61>{{cite magazine |title=Schwarzenegger Heats Up the Summer with Action-Packed True Lies|magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|issue=61|publisher=Sendai Publishing |date=August 1994|page=169}}</ref> The film follows U.S. government agent Harry Tasker (Schwarzenegger), who struggles to balance his double life as a spy with his familial duties.\n\nFor her performance, Curtis won the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress \u2013 Motion Picture Musical or Comedy]] and the [[Saturn Award for Best Actress]], while Cameron won the [[Saturn Award for Best Director]]. The film ultimately grossed $378 million worldwide at the box-office, becoming the [[1994 in film|third-highest-grossing film of 1994]], behind ''[[The Lion King]]'' and ''[[Forrest Gump]]''.<ref name=\"TVReboot\">{{cite web|url=https://ew.com/tv/2017/09/15/fox-reboot-james-cameron-true-lies/|title=Fox to reboot James Cameron's True Lies for TV|website=[[Entertainment Weekly]]}}</ref> It was also nominated at the [[Academy Award for Best Visual Effects|Academy Awards]] and [[BAFTA Award for Best Special Visual Effects|BAFTAs]] in the Best Visual Effects category, and also for seven [[Saturn Awards]].\n\n''True Lies'' was the first [[Lightstorm Entertainment]] project to be distributed under Cameron's multimillion-dollar production deal with [[20th Century Fox]], as well as the first major production for the visual effects company [[Digital Domain]], which was co-founded by Cameron. It was also [[List of most expensive films|the first film to cost $100 million]].\n\n==Plot==\nHarry Tasker leads a double life: to his legal secretary wife Helen and his rebellious daughter Dana, he is a boring computer salesman often away on business trips, while in actuality he is a secret agent for Omega Sector, a top-secret U.S. [[counterterrorism]] agency. Harry, along with fellow agents Albert \"Gib\" Gibson and Faisil, infiltrate a party in [[Switzerland]] hosted by billionaire Jamal Khaled, where Harry meets beautiful art dealer Juno Skinner. Eventually they learn that Juno is not only Khaled's art dealer, but that she is being paid by an [[Islamic terrorist|Islamic terrorism]] group called \"Crimson Jihad\", led by Salim Abu Aziz. Harry visits her undercover as a potential buyer to learn more, leading Aziz and his men to attempt to kill him. Harry fights them off, but loses Aziz in pursuit. As a result, he misses the birthday party that his wife and daughter had planned for him.\n\nHarry goes to Helen's office the next day to smooth things over and surprise her for lunch, but overhears her making secret arrangements to meet a man named Simon. Suspecting Helen is having an affair, he uses Omega Sector resources to learn that Simon is a used car salesman who pretends to be a covert agent to flirt with women. In disguise, Harry and other Omega agents kidnap Helen and Simon. After terrifying Simon into keeping away from Helen, Harry and Gib interrogate Helen using a voice masking device and learn that she is desperately seeking adventure because of Harry's constant absences. Harry thus arranges for Helen to participate in a staged spy mission, where she is to seduce a mysterious figure (who is actually Harry himself) and plant a bug in his hotel room. Aziz's men suddenly burst in, kidnap the couple, and take them to an island in the [[Florida Keys]].\n\nOn the island, Harry's suspicions about Juno are confirmed: Crimson Jihad paid her to help them smuggle four stolen [[Multiple independently targetable reentry vehicle|MIRV]] nuclear warheads into the country by hiding them in priceless antique statues. Aziz demands that the United States remove all [[U.S. military]] forces from the [[Arab states of the Persian Gulf|Persian Gulf]] forever or else he will detonate a warhead each week in a major U.S. city. He also says he will detonate one warhead on the uninhabited island to demonstrate that Crimson Jihad is a nuclear power. Before he and Helen are tortured, Harry is administered a [[truth serum]] and confesses his double life to Helen. They escape to watch as one warhead is set to explode in 90 minutes and the others are loaded onto vehicles to be taken into the U.S. via the [[Overseas Highway]], thus bypassing U.S. [[Customs]]. Harry and Helen get separated in the ensuing melee where Harry kills most of the terrorists, but Aziz gets away with one of the warheads. Helen is caught by Juno and taken in a limousine following the convoy. Gib and other Omega agents pick up Harry and they use two [[United States Marine Corps|Marine]] [[Harrier jump jet]]s to stop the convoy by destroying part of the [[Seven Mile Bridge]]. Harry rescues Helen from Juno's limo before it topples off the Highway.\n\nThe warhead left on the island detonates in front of the public without killing anyone. Gib tells Harry that Aziz and his men are holding Dana hostage in a downtown [[Miami]] skyscraper and are threatening to detonate their last warhead. Harry commandeers one of the Harriers to rescue his daughter. Faisil gets into the building by posing as part of a news team requested by Aziz. When he kills several of Aziz's men, Dana steals the missile control key and flees to the building's roof, eventually climbing a tower crane and threatening to drop the key to the street. Aziz pursues and nearly catches her before Harry arrives. Harry rescues a shocked Dana and after a tense struggle with Aziz, he eventually has him ensnared on the end of one of the plane's missiles, which Harry fires at a terrorist helicopter, killing Aziz and the remnants of Crimson Jihad. Harry, Helen, and Dana are then safely reunited.\n\nA year later, Harry and Helen are working together as Omega agents. While on a mission at a formal party, they encounter Simon, working as a waiter and pretending to be a spy as before. He runs away in fear after they reveal themselves and threaten to kill him. They dance a passionate [[tango]] while waiting for their contact and with Gib pleading with them to take their work seriously.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] as Harry Tasker\n* [[Jamie Lee Curtis]] as Helen Tasker\n* [[Tom Arnold (actor)|Tom Arnold]] as Albert \"Gib\" Gibson\n* [[Art Malik]] as Salim Abu Aziz\n* [[Bill Paxton]] as Simon\n* [[Tia Carrere]] as Juno Skinner\n* [[Eliza Dushku]] as Dana Tasker\n* [[Grant Heslov]] as Faisil\n* [[Charlton Heston]] as Spencer Trilby\n* [[Marshall Manesh]] as Jamal Khaled\n* James Allen as Colonel\n* [[Ofer Samra]] as Yusef\n{{Div col end}}\n\n==Production==\nArnold Schwarzenegger stated that while filming a scene with a horse, a camera boom hit the horse and \"it went crazy, spinning and rearing\" near a drop of 90 feet.
