The film co-stars [[Roger Moore]], [[James Remar]] and [[Janet Gunn]]. ''The Quest'' premiered in Turkey on April 19, 1996, and was released in the United States on April 26, 1996.\n\nThe plot, set in 1925, revolves around a [[martial arts]] tournament in the mysterious \"Lost City\", located deep in [[Tibet]], with martial artists from around the world fighting to earn the winner's prize, the \"Golden Dragon\", a valuable statue made of solid gold. Claims by [[Frank Dux]] that the film was a reworking of a script he had written in 1991, entitled \"Enter the New Dragon: The Kumite,\" were rejected by a jury.<ref>{{Cite news|title= Van Damme Cleared in Suit Over 'Quest' |work= The Los Angeles Times|date=1998-11-11|url= https://articles.latimes.com/1998/nov/11/entertainment/ca-41432|accessdate=2010-08-23}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title= Van Damme Victor in Clash|work=[[People (magazine)|People]]|url= http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,615023,00.html|accessdate=2011-03-12}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nLate night in an empty bar in the present day (the mid-1990s), an old man enters and awaits service, and not long after, a group of thugs arrive and attempt to rob the till. The old man defeats them easily one by one with hand-to-hand combat. Amazed, the bartender asks how he learned to fight. The old man replies \"it was long ago...\" He tells him the story.\n\nChristopher Dubois is a [[pickpocketing|pickpocket]] in his mid-twenties, living in 1925 [[New York City]]. Orphaned as a child, Dubois looks after a large group of young orphans by performing cons and stealing. After stealing a large sum of money from a group of gangsters, Dubois and the children are found by the gangsters. Dubois is able to subdue the gangsters, but the struggle draws the attention of the police. After promising to return to the children, Dubois escapes the police by stowing away on a boat. He is found out by the crew and imprisoned by gun [[smuggling|smuggler]]s and [[piracy|pirate]]s and forced into physical labor. Eventually, the crew decides Dubois is no longer needed, but before he can be killed, the pirate ship is attacked and boarded by a [[mercenary]] Englishman, Lord Edgar Dobbs. After saving each other's lives, Dobbs agrees to help Dubois return home, but deceives him and sells Dubois into slavery on an island off the coast of [[History of Thailand|Siam]], where Dubois is trained in [[Muay Thai]] fighting.\n\nAfter six months, Dobbs and his partner Harry Smythe find Dubois fighting in a Muay Thai match and see that he has become a skilled fighter. Dobbs later assists (and exploits) Dubois, buying his freedom so the now-expert fighter can represent the U.S in a Kumite-like [[tournament]] called the Ghang-gheng, held in the Lost City of [[Tibet]]. There representatives of [[Germany]], [[Soviet Union]], [[Scotland]], [[Spain]], [[Turkey]], [[Brazil]], [[Korea]], [[History of Thailand|Siam]], [[Greece]], [[France]], [[China]], [[Japan]], [[Okinawa Prefecture|Okinawa]], [[Africa]], and [[Mongolia]] fight in elimination bouts. The winner of the tournament receives a valuable statue made of solid gold, the Golden Dragon. Along for the journey are American reporter Carrie Newton and heavyweight boxing champion Maxie Devine.\n\nDubois ultimately wins the tournament by defeating Khan, the representative of [[Mongolia]], and he is given a medal and proclaimed the greatest fighter, but does not accept the Golden Dragon. Instead he trades it for the lives of Dobbs and his comrade Harry, who were sentenced to death for previously trying to steal the Golden Dragon.\n\nBack in the bar, Dubois explains he returned to New York and helped the children get off the streets. Ultimately, things turned out for the best. Devine helped to train many great fighters, while Dobbs and Harry opened a trading post deep in the Amazon. In the final scene, a book closes, revealing its title, 'The Quest', and that it was written by Carrie Newton.\n\n==The Ghang-gheng==\n''Winners in bold.''\n\n;First-round matches\n*Soviet Union vs '''Spain'''\n*'''Japan''' vs Okinawa\n*France vs '''Brazil'''\n*'''China''' vs Korea\n*'''Turkey''' vs Scotland\n*'''Siam''' vs Africa\n*Germany vs '''United States'''\n*'''Mongolia''' vs Greece\n\n;Second-round matches\n*'''Japan''' vs Turkey\n*Brazil vs '''China'''\n*'''Mongolia''' vs Siam\n*Spain vs '''United States'''\n\n;Semi-final matches\n*'''United States''' vs China\n*'''Mongolia''' vs Japan\n\n;Final match\n*'''United States''' vs Mongolia\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Jean-Claude Van Damme]] as Chris Dubois, United States fighter\n* [[Roger Moore]] as Lord Edgar Dobbs\n* [[James Remar]] as Maxie Devine, United States Heavyweight Boxing Champion \n* [[Janet Gunn]] as Carrie Newton\n* [[Jack McGee (actor)|Jack McGee]] as Harry Smythe\n* [[Aki Aleong]] as Khao Prahan\n* [[Louis Mandylor]] as Riggi\n* Chang Ching Peng Chaplin as Master Tchi\n* [[Ryan Cutrona]] as Officer O'Keefe\n* [[Abdel Qissi]] as Khan, Mongolian fighter\n* Jen Sung as Phang Prahan, Siamese fighter\n* Stefanos Miltsakakis as Greek fighter \n* Ong Soo Han as Korean fighter \n* Peter Wong as Chinese fighter\n* [[K\u014dji Kitao]] as Kyoshiro Yama, Japanese fighter\n* C\u00e9sar Carneiro as Brazilian fighter\n* Habby Heske as German fighter\n* [[Peter Malota]] as Spanish fighter\n* Azdine Nouri as Turkish fighter\n* [[Brick Bronsky]] as Russian fighter\n* Winston Ellis as African fighter\n* Takis Triggelis as French fighter\n* Mike Lambert as Scottish fighter\n* Choi-Nam Yip as Okinawa fighter\n}}\n\n==Production==\nThe re-written script was revealed in 1993 by Quintano.<ref name=\"scratch\">{{cite magazine |date=9 July 1993 |first=Christian |last=Moerk |title=Quintano builds from 'Scratch' |url=https://variety.com/1993/film/news/quintano-builds-from-scratch-108558/ |magazine=Variety }}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Box office===\n''The Quest'' opened at #1 and earned $7 million in its first weekend in the US.<ref>{{Cite news|title='The Quest' Finds Its Audience |work= The Los Angeles Times|date=1996-04-30|url= https://articles.latimes.com/1996-04-30/entertainment/ca-64135_1_weekend-box|accessdate=2010-08-24|first=Robert W.|last=Welkos}}</ref> It fell to third in the week of May 6.<ref>{{cite news|title='The Craft' Has the Knack for Scaring Up an Audience|work= [[Los Angeles Times]]|date=1996-05-06|url= https://articles.latimes.com/1996-05-06/entertainment/ca-1108_1_sony-pictures|accessdate=2012-06-03|first=Judy|last=Brennan}}</ref> It ultimately grossed $21.6 million at the American box office and $35.8 million internationally, for a grand total of $57.4 million.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=quest.htm|title=The Quest|work=[[Box Office Mojo]]|accessdate=December 26, 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Critical response===\nThe reaction of many professional film critics was negative, citing the movie's thin script, Jean-Claude Van Damme's direction, and too much resemblance to Van Damme's previous hit ''[[Bloodsport (film)|Bloodsport]]''.
