A wrench is thrown into the system when DiNorscio fires his lawyer and decides to represent himself. The film also stars [[Peter Dinklage]], [[Linus Roache]], [[Alex Rocco]], and [[Ron Silver]].\n\n==Plot==\nIn the mid 1980s, Mafia soldier Jackie DiNorscio ([[Vin Diesel]]) and 19 of his peers have been waiting a year for their federal racketeering trial to begin. While out on bail, Jackie is shot by his drug addict cousin Tony Compagna ([[Ra\u00fal Esparza]]). Afraid of being killed by the extended mob family run by Nick Calabrese ([[Alex Rocco]]), Tony agrees to be a government witness for district attorney Sean Kierney ([[Linus Roache]]). Shortly after, Jackie is arrested and sentenced to 22\u201330 years in prison after being set up in an unrelated drug sting by the [[DEA]]. Kierney tries to pressure Jackie into cooperating with the government against his codefendants in order to get an early release date, but Jackie flatly refuses.\n\nUpset over the results of his previous trial, Jackie fires his lawyer and decides to represent himself. This adds to the burdens of the court, already having to deal with 20 defendants and their lawyers. Judge Sidney Finestein ([[Ron Silver]]) strongly advises against it, but lead defense attorney Ben Klandis ([[Peter Dinklage]]) agrees to assist Jackie. Both Klandis and Kierney recognize Jackie's ability to charm the jury, but his arrogant, vulgar behavior eventually start irritating everyone. As revenge, Kierney arranges for Jackie to have all of his prison privileges revoked. No one is more upset than Nick, who believes Jackie will cost them the trial and threatens to sever himself from the case. As weeks turn into months, the court case evolves into a marathon affair. Kierney wants Jackie kicked off the case, but Judge Finestein reluctantly agrees to keep the trial going. Jackie realizes he has gone too far and apologizes to the judge.\n\nWanting to remove the possibility that even one defendant gets acquitted, Kearny offers a final plea deal to all the defendants. In return for pleading guilty, they will all get shorter sentences than they would be facing if found guilty. Jackie tells his codefendants that he refuses to take a deal even though he is already serving a long sentence for drug trafficking. This convinces Nick and the others to turn down the deal too. The final witness is Jackie's cousin Tony. Klandis is able to use Tony's heavy drug use to discredit him as a witness and Jackie emotionally cross-examines his cousin and asks why he betrayed his love for him.\n\nAfter 21 months of testimony, the trial concludes with closing arguments. The prosecution and defense teams return to their homes expecting the jury to deliberate for at least a week. However, after only 14 hours of deliberation the jury returns a verdict of not guilty on all charges. While the rest of the defendants leave the courtroom with their families, Jackie returns to prison to finish his sentence. He receives a hero's welcome at the correctional facility, where fellow prisoners chant his name and reach out to shake his hand.\n\nThe end title cards explain that the real Jackie DiNorscio served 17 and a half years before being paroled in 2002. He died of natural causes during filming.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Vin Diesel]] as [[Jackie DiNorscio]]\n* [[Peter Dinklage]] as Ben Klandis\n* [[Linus Roache]] as Sean Kierney ([[Samuel Alito]])\n* [[Ron Silver]] as Judge Sidney Finestein\n* [[Annabella Sciorra]] as Bella DiNorscio\n* [[Alex Rocco]] as Nick Calabrese ([[Anthony Accetturo]])\n* [[Jerry Adler]] as Rizzo\n* [[Ra\u00fal Esparza]] as Tony Compagna\n* [[Richard Portnow]] as Max Novardis\n* [[Aleksa Palladino]] as Marina DiNorscio\n* [[Robert Stanton (actor)|Robert Stanton]] as Chris Newberger\n* [[Marcia Jean Kurtz]] as Sara Stiles\n* [[Domenick Lombardozzi]] as Jerry McQueen\n* [[Josh Pais]] as Harry Bellman\n* [[Peter McRobbie]] as Peter Petraki\n* [[Chuck Cooper (actor)|Chuck Cooper]] as James Washington\n* Frank Pietrangolare as Carlo Mascarpone ([[Michael Taccetta]])\n* Richard DeDomenico as Tom \"Nappy\" Napoli\n* Jerry Grayson as Jimmy \"The Jew\" Katz\n* Tony Ray Rossi as Joe Bellini\n* [[Vinny Vella]] as Graziedei\n* Paul Borghese as Gino Mascarpone ([[Martin Taccetta]])\n* [[Frank Adonis]] as Phil Radda\n* Nick Puccio as Alessandro Tedeschi\n* Frankie Perrone as Henry Fiuli\n* Salvatore Paul Piro as Mike Belaggio\n* [[James Biberi]] as Frank Brentano\n* Oscar A.

It was the first time in New Jersey history that an entire organized crime family had been indicted in one prosecution. However, this crime family proved to be only a faction of the Lucchese crime family, only operating in New Jersey. But due to the crew's membership and 20 defendants, U.S. law enforcement recognized the crew as its own crime family.\n\nThe case went to trial in November 1986, based on a 65-page indictment. It started in March 1987 at the federal courthouse in [[Newark, New Jersey|Newark]]. It ended on August 26, 1988. The U.S. Clerk\u2019s Office in Newark confirmed that officially ''The United States v. Anthony Accetturo et al.'' was the longest criminal case on record in the federal courts of the nation.\n\nThe jury found a verdict of not guilty in favor of all the defendants. The trial followed a ten-year investigation and generated 240 volumes and 850 exhibits of evidence. It cost taxpayers millions of dollars, and was the result of a 76 count [[Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act]] (RICO) indictment.\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of American films of 2006]]\n* [[The Jersey Crew]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|0419749}}\n* {{AFI movie|63815}}\n* {{TCMDb movie|629186}}\n* {{AllMovie movie|318355}}\n* {{TV Guide movie|<!-- find-me-guilty/ -->2030142658}}\n* {{Box Office Mojo|findmeguilty}}\n* {{Rotten Tomatoes|m/find_me_guilty}}\n* {{Metacritic film}}\n* [http://www.screenit.com/movies/2006/find_me_guilty.html ''Find Me Guilty''] at Screen It!\n\n{{Sidney Lumet}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Find Me Guilty}}\n[[Category:2006 films]]\n[[Category:2000s crime comedy-drama films]]\n[[Category:American courtroom films]]\n[[Category:American crime comedy-drama films]]\n[[Category:American films based on actual events]]\n[[Category:Biographical films about gangsters]]\n[[Category:2000s English-language films]]\n[[Category:Juries in fiction]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Sidney Lumet]]\n[[Category:Films produced by Robert Greenhut]]\n[[Category:Films set in New York City]]\n[[Category:Films set in the 1980s]]\n[[Category:Films shot in New Jersey]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Newark, New Jersey]]\n[[Category:Mafia comedy films]]\n[[Category:One Race Films films]]\n[[Category:2000s American films]]"}]}}}}
