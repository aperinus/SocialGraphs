Divided into a series of seasonal vignettes, starting with Summer 1903, it relates the story of a year in the life of the Smith family in [[St. Louis]] leading up to the opening of the [[Louisiana Purchase Exposition]] (more commonly referred to as the [[World's fair|World's Fair]]) in the spring of 1904.<ref>''[[Variety Film Reviews|Variety]]'' film review; November 1, 1944, page 10.</ref><ref>''[[Harrison's Reports and Film Reviews|Harrison's Reports]]'' film review; November 4, 1944, page 178.</ref> The film stars [[Judy Garland]], [[Margaret O'Brien]], [[Mary Astor]], [[Lucille Bremer]], [[Tom Drake]], [[Leon Ames (actor)|Leon Ames]], [[Marjorie Main]], [[June Lockhart]] and [[Joan Carroll]].\n\nThe film was adapted by [[Irving Brecher]] and [[Fred F. Finklehoffe]] from a [[Meet Me in St. Louis (novel)|series of short stories]] by [[Sally Benson]] originally published in ''[[The New Yorker]]'' magazine called \"The Kensington Stories\"<ref name=\"Schatz\" /> and later in novel form as ''[[Meet Me in St. Louis (novel)|Meet Me in St. Louis]]''. The film was directed by [[Vincente Minnelli]], who met Garland on the set and later married her. [[Tony Award]]-winning designer [[Lemuel Ayers]] served as the film's art director.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1955/09/11/archives/lemuel-ayers.html?searchResultPosition=1|title= Obituary: Lemuel Ayers|date=September 11, 1955|work=[[The New York Times]]|author=Arnold Saint-Subber}}</ref>\n\nUpon its release, ''Meet Me in St. Louis'' was both a critical and a commercial success.

In 1994, the film was deemed \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\" by the [[Library of Congress]] and selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]].\n\nGarland debuted the [[Standard (music)|standards]] \"[[The Trolley Song]]\", [[The Boy Next Door (song)|\"The Boy Next Door\"]] and \"[[Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas]]\", all of which became hits after the film was released. The film's producer [[Arthur Freed]] also wrote and performed one of the songs.\n\n==Plot==\n[[File:Meet-Me-in-St-Louis-LIFE-1944.jpg|thumb|300px|left|[[Margaret O'Brien]] and [[Judy Garland]] perform the song \"Under the Bamboo Tree\" in ''Meet Me in St. Louis'']]\n\nThe backdrop for the film is St. Louis, Missouri, in the year preceding the 1904 [[Louisiana Purchase Exposition]] [[World's fair|World's Fair]].\n\nIn the summer of 1903, the Smith family leads a comfortable upper-middle class life. Alonzo Smith and his wife Anna have four daughters: Rose, Esther, Agnes and Tootie, and a son, Lon Jr. Esther, the second-oldest daughter, is in love with the boy next door, John Truett, although he does not notice her at first. Tootie rides with iceman Mr. Neely and debates whether St. Louis is the nation's top city. Rose, the eldest daughter, hopes in vain to receive a marriage proposal from Warren Sheffield.\n\nEsther finally meets John properly when he is a guest at the Smiths' party and hopes to meet him again on a trolley ride to the construction site of the World's Fair.\n\nOn [[Halloween]], Tootie and Agnes attend a bonfire. Later, after Tootie appears with a split lip and lost tooth, she claims that John tried to kill her. Esther confronts John, physically attacking and scolding him. After Esther returns, Tootie and Agnes confess the truth: John was trying to protect them from the police after a dangerous prank went wrong. Upon learning the truth, Esther apologizes to John and they share their first kiss.\n\nMr. Smith announces that he is to be sent to [[New York City]] on business and they will all move there after Christmas. The family is devastated by the news, especially Rose and Esther, whose romances, friendships and educational plans are threatened. Esther is also aghast because they will miss the World's Fair. Although Mrs. Smith is also upset, she reconciles with her husband and they sing a tender duet at the piano.\n\n[[File:Meet-Me-in-St-Louis-1.jpg|thumb|270px|right|Margaret O'Brien and Judy Garland in ''Meet Me in St. Louis'']]\nAn elegant ball takes place on Christmas Eve. John cannot take Esther because he was too late to pick up his tuxedo. Esther is relieved when her grandfather offers to take her to the ball instead. At the ball, Esther and Rose plot to ruin the evening of Warren's date Lucille Ballard by filling her [[dance card]] with losers. They are surprised to find that Lucille is warm, friendly and not a snob. She suggests that Warren should be with Rose, allowing her to be with Lon. Esther switches her dance card with Lucille's and takes on the clumsy and awkward partners. After being rescued by Grandpa, Esther is overjoyed when John appears in a tuxedo, and they dance for the rest of the evening. Later, John proposes to Esther and she accepts, but their future is uncertain because she must still move to New York.\n\nEsther returns home to find Tootie waiting impatiently for [[Santa Claus]] and worrying about whether she can bring all her toys with her to New York. After Esther's poignant rendition of \"[[Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas]]\", an inconsolable Tootie destroys the [[snowmen]] that they must leave behind. Esther reassures Tootie that they will be together no matter where they go. Mr. Smith, who has witnessed the girls outside, begins to have second thoughts. After thinking in the living room, he summons the family downstairs and announces that they will not move to New York, much to everyone's surprise and joy. Warren rushes into the Smith home, declares his love for Rose, and announces that they will marry at the first possible opportunity. Realizing that it is now Christmas, the Smiths celebrate.\n\nAt the World's Fair, the family gathers overlooking the Grand Lagoon just as thousands of lights around the grand pavilion are illuminated.\n\n== Production ==\nThe film is based on \"The Kensington Stories\", a series of sentimental family stories by [[Sally Benson]] that appeared in ''[[The New Yorker]]'' in 1942 and later in novel form as ''[[Meet Me in St. Louis (novel)|Meet Me in St. Louis]]''. Shortly after the publication of the stories, [[Arthur Freed]], who had enjoyed previous success with Judy Garland in MGM musicals, convinced studio head [[Louis B. Mayer]] to purchase the film rights for $25,000, and Benson was also hired to work on the screen adaptation. The idea for the film was also inspired by ''[[Life with Father]]'', a nostalgic family play that had been running on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] to great success and acclaim since 1939.<ref name=\"Schatz\">{{Cite book|last=Schatz|first=Thomas|title=The Genius of the System: Hollywood Filmmaking in the Studio Era|publisher=Pantheon Books|year=1989|isbn=0805046666|location=New York}}</ref>\n\nWhile Freed and his writers developed the script, director [[Vincente Minnelli]], whose background was in set and costume design, prepared the film's design. Minnelli worked with designer [[Lemuel Ayers]] on set design and with art director [[E. Preston Ames]] to capture the evocative quality of paintings by [[Thomas Eakins]], a popular artist and illustrator at the time in which the story takes place.<ref name=\"Schatz\" />\n\nA staff of six writers worked with Benson to capture the essence of her stories. Freed hired the husband-and-wife team of [[Victor Heerman]] and [[Sarah Y. Mason|Sarah Mason]] in mid-1942 to add an element of intrigue to the script. They introduced a [[blackmail]] plot involving Esther Smith, which Freed found inappropriate, so he tasked staff writer [[William Ludwig (screenwriter)|William Ludwig]], a specialist in adolescent romance, to excise the blackmail plot and weave courtship stories into the screenplay. By February 1943, Freed was satisfied with Ludwig's script and distributed copies around MGM and to the principal cast members. However, Garland was dissatisfied with the script, feeling its plot to be weak and her character too juvenile. Mayer agreed, and Freed brought in a pair of writers to revise Ludwig's script who added the storyline of the family's looming move to New York. Freed liked the changes but Garland remained unhappy with the script.<ref name=\"Schatz\" />\n\nFreed's conflict with producer [[Joseph L. Mankiewicz]], Garland's lover who was developing what would become ''[[The Pirate (1948 film)|The Pirate]]'' with Garland in mind for the lead role, nearly caused ''Meet Me in St. Louis'' to be indefinitely postponed. The situation was resolved when Mankiewicz left MGM for Fox, and Freed's project was given the green light with a preliminary budget of $1,395,000 and plans to begin production in early October 1943. However, production was delayed because of studio problems and Technicolor Inc.'s heavy schedule, and the project finally entered production on December 7, 1943, with shooting scheduled for 58 days and a budget that had increased to $1,500,000. Nearly half of the film's budget was devoted to sets ($497,000) and music ($234,000). Story and continuity costs exceeded $132,000 because of the numerous rewrites. Garland was paid $2,500 per week, [[Margaret O'Brien]] $250 per week and Minnelli $1,000 per week while producing the film.<ref name=\"Schatz\" />\n\nGarland, unhappy with the script and unsure of herself as a leading lady, also suffered severe emotional problems, an acute addiction to [[Substituted amphetamine|amphetamines]] and numerous physical ailments such as recurring [[migraine]] headaches. Production reports show that she disrupted the schedule with fits of hysteria, habitual lateness and occasional absences, missing an entire week of shooting because of what she claimed to be an ear infection. Garland also balked at Minnelli's heavy schedule of rehearsals and prerecording sessions in the months preceding filming, but Minnelli won her confidence and the two became lovers, cohabiting by the time of the film's post-production and marrying soon after its release.<ref name=\"Schatz\" /> Earlier in the production, Garland had a brief affair with her costar [[Tom Drake]].<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Clarke |first=Gerald |date=2000-04-01 |title=Till MGM Do Us Part |url=https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2000/04/judy-garland-excerpt-200004 |journal=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]}}</ref>\n\nProduction delays were also caused by illnesses suffered by O'Brien, [[Mary Astor]] ([[pneumonia]]) and [[Joan Carroll]] ([[appendicitis]]), but Minnelli used the delays to prepare O'Brien's most demanding and important scenes. Severe rains and flooding in the Los Angeles region caused further delays in the production of exterior scenes. Filming completed on April 7, 1944, behind schedule and with a final budget near $1.8 million. The first rough cut ran exceeded two hours in length, so the writers suggested edits that brought the film down to 113 minutes for its preview screenings in the summer of 1944. MGM, encouraged by overwhelmingly positive audience previews, held the film's release for the Christmas season. The [[premiere]] was held in [[St. Louis]] on November 22, 1944 and at New York's [[Astor Theatre (New York City)|Astor Theatre]] one week later.<ref name=\"Schatz\" />\n\nMinnelli's idea to introduce each season segment with a greeting-card illustration dissolving into live action was most likely influenced by a similar technique used in [[Orson Welles]]' 1942 film ''[[The Magnificent Ambersons (film)|The Magnificent Ambersons]]''.<ref name=\"Schatz\" />\n\nFreed's process for ''Meet Me in St. Louis'' established a pattern for Minnelli's future musicals: budgets in excess of $1 million, preproduction schedules sometimes exceeding a full year, shooting schedules of three to six months and postproduction phases of six months or longer.<ref name=\"Schatz\" />\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Meet Me In St Louis Judy Garland Margaret O'Brien 1944.jpg|thumb|right| [[Margaret O'Brien]] and [[Judy Garland]]  ]]\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Judy Garland]] as Esther Smith\n* [[Margaret O'Brien]] as \"Tootie\" Smith\n* [[Mary Astor]] as Mrs. Anna Smith\n* [[Lucille Bremer]] as Rose Smith\n* [[Leon Ames]] as Mr. Alonzo Smith\n* [[Tom Drake]] as John Truett\n* [[Marjorie Main]] as Katie (Maid)\n* [[Harry Davenport (actor)|Harry Davenport]] as Grandpa\n* [[June Lockhart]] as Lucille Ballard\n* Henry H.

The song's lyrics were originally different. Lyricist Hugh Martin's opening lyrics were deemed too depressing by Judy Garland, Tom Drake, and Vincente Minnelli, and Martin changed them. The lyrics originally were: \"Have yourself a merry little Christmas / It may be your last / Next year we may all be living in the past.\" Years after the film's release, additional lyric changes were made for [[Frank Sinatra]], who objected to the song's generally downbeat tone.\n\n===Deleted song===\nGarland's prerecording of \"Boys and Girls Like You and Me\" survives, but the cut film footage has been lost.
