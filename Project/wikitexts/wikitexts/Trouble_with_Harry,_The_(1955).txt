The screenplay by [[John Michael Hayes]] was based on the 1950 novel by [[Jack Trevor Story]]. It starred [[Edmund Gwenn]], [[John Forsythe]], [[Mildred Natwick]], [[Jerry Mathers]] and [[Shirley MacLaine]] in her film debut. ''The Trouble with Harry'' was released in the United States on September 30, 1955, then re-released in 1984 once the distribution rights had been acquired by [[Universal Pictures]].\n\nThe action in ''The Trouble with Harry'' takes place during a sun-filled autumn in the [[Vermont]] countryside. The [[fall foliage]] and the beautiful scenery around the village, as well as [[Bernard Herrmann]]'s light-filled score, all set an idyllic tone. The story is about how nine residents of a small Vermont village react when the dead body of a man named Harry is found on a hillside. The film is, however, not a murder mystery: it is a light comedy-drama with a touch of romance, in which the corpse serves as a [[MacGuffin]]. Four village residents end up working together to solve the problem of what to do with Harry. In the process, the younger two (an artist and a very young, twice-widowed woman) fall in love and become a couple, soon to be married. The older two residents (a captain and a spinster) also fall in love.\n\nThe film was one of Hitchcock's few true comedies (though most of his films had some element of tongue-in-cheek or macabre humor). The film also contained what was, for the time, frank dialogue. One example of this is when John Forsythe's character unabashedly tells MacLaine's character that he would like to paint a nude portrait of her. The statement was explicit compared with other contemporary movies.\n\n== Plot ==\nThe quirky but down-to-earth residents of the small hamlet of Highwater, Vermont, are faced with the freshly dead body of Harry Worp (Philip Truex), which has inconveniently appeared on the hillside above the town. The problem of who the person is, who was responsible for his sudden death, and what should be done with the body is \"the trouble with Harry\".\n\nCaptain Wiles ([[Edmund Gwenn]]) is sure that he killed the man with a stray shot from his rifle while hunting, until it is shown he actually shot a rabbit. Jennifer Rogers ([[Shirley MacLaine]]), Harry's estranged wife, believes she killed Harry because she hit him hard with a milk bottle. Miss Gravely ([[Mildred Natwick]]) is certain that the man died after a blow from the heel of her hiking boot when he lunged at her out of the bushes, while still reeling from the blow he received at the hands of Jennifer. Sam Marlowe ([[John Forsythe]]), an attractive and nonconformist artist, is open-minded about the whole event, and is prepared to help his neighbors and new-found friends in any way he can. In any case, no one is upset at all about Harry's death.\n\nHowever, they all are hoping that the body will not come to the attention of \"the authorities\" in the form of cold, humorless Deputy Sheriff Calvin Wiggs ([[Royal Dano]]), who earns his living per arrest. The Captain, Jennifer, Miss Gravely and Sam bury the body and then dig it up again several times throughout the day. They then hide the body in a bathtub before finally putting it back on the hill where it first appeared, in order to make it appear as if it was just discovered.\n\nFinally it is learned that Harry died of natural causes; no foul play at all was involved. In the meantime, Sam and Jennifer have fallen in love and wish to marry, and the Captain and Miss Gravely have also become a couple. Sam has been able to sell all his paintings to a passing millionaire, although Sam refuses money, and instead requests a few simple gifts for his friends and himself.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Edmund Gwenn]] as Capt.

In an interview for ''[[The New York Times]]'' on June 18, 1971, Hitchcock stated that the score was his favorite of all his films. Herrmann rerecorded a new arrangement of highlights from the film's score for [[Phase 4 Stereo]]<ref>MUSIC FROM THE GREAT MOVIE THRILLERS \u2013 MUSIC COMPOSED BY BERNARD HERRMANN FROM THE MOTION PICTURES DIRECTED BY ALFRED HITCHCOCK \u2013 Bernard Herrmann conducting the London Philharmonic Orchestra, London Phase 4 Stereo SP 44126</ref> with Herrmann calling the arrangement ''A Portrait of Hitch''.\n\nA song sung by John Forsythe's character, \"Flaggin' the Train to Tuscaloosa\", was written by [[Raymond Scott]] and [[Mack David]]. Forsythe is not the performer, however. The song is also played over the opening credits, performed by Ray McKinley & Orchestra and released as a single on Decca Records.\n\nA \"cash-in\" song titled \"The Trouble with Harry\" was written by [[Floyd Huddleston]] with Herb Wiseman and Mark McIntyre. A recording of the song by [[Ross Bagdasarian Sr.]] (using the pseudonym of \"Alfi & Harry\") was released as a single in early 1956, reaching No. 44 on the [[Billboard 200|US ''Billboard'']] chart and No. 15 on the UK singles chart. A competing version by [[Les Baxter]] reached No. 80 on the ''Billboard'' chart.

[[Bosley Crowther]], in a mixed verdict for ''[[The New York Times]]'', wrote: \"It is not a particularly witty or clever script that John Michael Hayes has put together from a novel by Jack Trevor Story, nor does Mr. Hitchcock's direction make it spin. The pace is leisurely, almost sluggish, and the humor frequently is strained ... But it does possess mild and mellow merriment all the way. The performers are beguiling in a briskly artificial style, and there's an especially disarming screwball blandness about the manner of Miss MacLaine.\"<ref>{{cite journal |last=Crowther |first=Bosley |date=October 18, 1955 |title=Screen: 'The Trouble With Harry' |journal=[[The New York Times]] |page=46 }}</ref> ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' called the film \"a blithe little comedy\" with Edmund Gwenn \"a delight\" in the lead role.<ref>{{cite journal |date=October 12, 1955 |title=The Trouble With Harry |journal=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |page=6 }}</ref> ''[[Harrison's Reports]]'' called it \"a whacky, off-beat type of film, well directed and acted and quite amusing throughout\", though the review cautioned that \"it may be received with mixed audience reaction\" because of the subject matter.<ref>{{cite journal |date=October 8, 1955 |title=Film Review: The Trouble With Harry |journal=[[Harrison's Reports]] |page=162 }}</ref> [[Richard L.
