Day by day, he toils away in a harsh, dull, and dehumanizing job, his only savior being the memories of the bliss of childhood. But at night, he works secretly on an invention that could help him relive those memories and spread their joy to everyone in his despair-filled life.\n\nWhen he finishes the invention, it changes the way people look at the world. His success changes him, however, because he loses an important part of himself.<ref>[https://archive.org/details/1998More 1998 More: Free Download, Borrow, and Streaming: Internet Archive]</ref>\n\n==Production and publication==\n''More'' was written and directed by [[Mark Osborne (filmmaker)|Mark Osborne]], and created by a team that included, among others, Keith and Shannon Lowry, Rick Orner, Nick Peterson, and David Candelaria. Although it was only a 6-minute [[short film|short]], it was, as Osborne put it, an \"absolutely massive undertaking\"\u2014as it was the first short to be shot using the [[IMAX]] format.<ref name= \"VOTD\">{{cite news |last=Sciretta |first=Peter |url= http://www.slashfilm.com/votd-mark-osbornes-more/ |title=VOTD: Mark Osborne's More |work=[[/Film]] |date=June 8, 2009 |access-date=July 2, 2018}}</ref> In addition, it was filmed using [[stop motion]], a much more time-consuming method than live-action filming techniques.\n\n[[File:More short 11c.png|thumb|right|116px|Nameless main character of ''More'']]\nFilming ''More'' took nine months, and it was first screened in fall of 1998. While it had a positive critical reception\u2014including an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nomination\u2014commercial options proved limited once the initial hype died down.\n\nAlthough ''More'' was subsequently included in the ''Short Cinema Journal #7: Utopia'' DVD, Osborne was receiving e-mails daily, asking for the short to be released on DVD. One of these was a writer <!-- name? --> from [[Despair, Inc.]], complimenting him on his work, which led to an offer for Despair to fund DVD production and to sell DVDs on their website. The DVD thus created included three commentaries and an hour-long documentary on the creation of ''More''. The film was also released on disk in the second issue of ''[[Wholphin (DVD)|Wholphin Magazine]]''.<ref>[https://www.ebay.com/itm/MORE-1998-Short-Film-Created-by-Mark-Osborne-Using-Stop-Motion-Animation-DVD-/132349325779 MORE: 1998 Short Film Created by Mark Osborne Using Stop Motion Animation DVD]</ref>\n\n==Soundtrack==\nThe song featured as background music is titled \"[[Elegia (New Order song)|Elegia]]\".<ref name= \"indie\">{{cite news |last=Delgado |first=Lisa |url= https://www.wired.com/2001/09/indie-filmmakers-push-for-more/ |title=Indie Filmmaker's Push for 'More |work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] |date=September 20, 2001 |access-date=July 2, 2018}}</ref> It was recorded by the band [[New Order (band)|New Order]] on the 1985 album ''[[Low-Life]]''.\n\n==Legacy==\nThe film ''More'' was adapted into the music video for the song \"Hell Bent\" by [[Kenna (musician)|Kenna]].\n\n==Awards==\n''More'' was awarded the following honors:\n*[[Sundance Film Festival]] - Special Jury Prize for Short Films\n*[[South by Southwest]] - Best Animated Short\n*Nominated - [[Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film]]<ref>[http://shortsbay.com/film/more Shorts Bay]</ref>\n*ResFest \u2013 Audience Award for Best Film, Grand Audience Prize for Best Film\n*Aspen Shorts Fest - Special Jury prize\n*World Fest Houston - Gold / Special Jury Prize for Shorts\n*USA Film Festival - Dallas - Grand Jury Prize for Shorts\n*Toronto International Short Film Fest - Best Animated Short, Best Short Overall\n*Stony Brook Film Fest - Best Short Film\n*''[[Message to Man]]'' International Film Festival - Russia \u2013 Best International Debut Film\n*PhilaFilm - Philadelphia \u2013 Best Animated Short\n*Nominated - [[Annie Award for Best Animated Short Subject]]\n*St. Louis International Film Festival - Best Short Film\n*Uppsala International Short Film Festival/Sweden - Audience Award for Best Film\n*San Francisco Indie Fest \u2013 Audience Award\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of stop-motion films]]\n*[[IMAX]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{IMDb title|id=0188913|title=More}}\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCeeTfsm8bk ''More'' on YouTube]\n* [https://www.shortoftheweek.com/2008/09/16/more/ Short of the Week article]\n\n{{Mark Osborne}}\n\n[[Category:1998 films]]\n[[Category:Stop-motion animated short films]]\n[[Category:IMAX short films]]\n[[Category:1998 short films]]\n[[Category:Clay animation films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Mark Osborne]]\n[[Category:American animated short films]]\n[[Category:1998 animated films]]\n[[Category:1990s stop-motion animated films]]\n[[Category:1990s American films]]"}]}}}}
