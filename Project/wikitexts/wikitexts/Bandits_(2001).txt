It stars [[Bruce Willis]], [[Billy Bob Thornton]], and [[Cate Blanchett]]. Filming began in October 2000 and ended in February 2001. It helped Thornton earn a [[National Board of Review of Motion Pictures|National Board of Review]] Best Actor Award for 2001. Thornton and Blanchett's performances earned praise, as each was nominated for Best Actor and Best Actress [[Golden Globe Awards]] for their performances in this film, while Blanchett was nominated for Best Supporting Actress at the [[Screen Actors Guild Awards]]. It first opened in theaters on October 12, 2001.\n\n==Plot==\nTwo friends and convicts, Joe and Terry, break out of [[Oregon State Penitentiary]] in a concrete mixing truck and start a bank robbing spree, hoping to fund a dream they share. They become known as the \"Sleepover Bandits\" because of their ''[[modus operandi]]'': they [[Tiger kidnapping|kidnap the manager of a target bank]] the night before a planned robbery, then spend the night with the manager's family; early the next morning, they accompany the manager to the bank to get their money. Using dim-witted would-be [[stunt man]] Harvey Pollard as their [[crime scene getaway|getaway driver]] and lookout, the three successfully pull off a series of robberies that gets them recognition on the [[FBI]]'s [[FBI Ten Most Wanted Fugitives|Ten Most Wanted]] list, and ultimately the reward for information leading to their capture is increased to $1 million.\n\nWhen Kate, a housewife with a failing marriage, decides to run away, she ends up in the hands of the criminals. Initially attracted to Joe, she also ends up in bed with Terry and a confused [[love triangle]] begins.\n\nThe three of them go on the lam and manage to pull off a few more robberies, but after a while the two begin to fight over Kate, and she decides to leave them. The two criminals then decide to pull off one last job.\n\nThe story is told in [[Flashback (narrative)|flashbacks]], framed by the story of the pair's last robbery of the Alamo Bank, as told by ''Criminals at Large'', a fictional [[reality television]] show, with which they taped an interview stating that Kate was only a hostage, not a participant.  The show tells the story of their last job, which is known to be a failure when Kate tips off the police and the two are caught in the act. The two then begin to argue when Joe tells the police \"You won't take us alive!\" and the argument gets to the point where the two of them shoot each other dead.\n\nAt the end of the film the real story behind the last job is revealed: Harvey used some of his special effects to make it seem as though Terry and Joe were shooting each other. Dressed as paramedics, Harvey and his girlfriend Claire then run in and place the stolen money, Terry, and Joe in body bags while Kate (who was in on the plan) distracts the police by pretending to pass out in shock upon seeing the \"bodies.\"  In the ambulance, Harvey used electronics to blow out his tires which sent the ambulance into a junkyard. Under his jumpsuit, Harvey was wearing a fire suit. He lit himself on fire and rigged a bomb to go off. Harvey, Claire, Terry, and Joe flee the scene, leading officials to believe that the bodies were burned beyond recognition. Kate receives the $1 million reward for having turned them in.\n\nReunited, Joe, Terry, Harvey, and Kate make it to Mexico to live out their dream. The last scene shows Harvey and Claire getting married in Mexico and Kate kissing Joe and Terry passionately.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Bruce Willis]] as Joe Blake\n* [[Billy Bob Thornton]] as Terry Collins\n* [[Cate Blanchett]] as Kate Wheeler\n* [[Troy Garity]] as Harvey Pollard\n* [[Br\u00edan F.
