Reilly]]. It follows Brennan (Ferrell) and Dale (Reilly), two grown men who are forced to live together as brothers after their single parents, with whom they still live, marry each other. [[Richard Jenkins]], [[Mary Steenburgen]], [[Adam Scott (actor)|Adam Scott]], and [[Kathryn Hahn]] also star.\n\nThe film was released by [[Sony Pictures Releasing]] on July 25, 2008, two years after ''[[Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby]]''. Both films feature the same main actors, as well as the same producing and writing team. It grossed $128.1 million and received mixed reviews.\n\n==Plot==\nBrennan Huff and Dale Doback are 40 year old [[Peter Pan syndrome|immature adults]] still living at home. Brennan lives with his [[divorce]]d mother, Nancy, and Dale lives with his [[widow]]ed father, Robert. Robert and Nancy meet, fall in love, and get married; forcing Brennan and Dale to live with each other as [[Stepsibling|step brother]]s. Brennan and Dale despise each other for interfering with each other's lifestyles. Dale warns Brennan not to touch his [[drum kit|drum set]], which Brennan later does (twice, once with his testicles) anyway. He is confronted by Dale, and the argument erupts into a violent brawl between the two. They are grounded with no television for a week following the incident and told they must find jobs within a month, or they will be evicted.\n\nWhen Brennan's younger and more successful brother Derek, a [[helicopter]] leasing agent, comes to visit with his family, he openly ridicules them for their lack of ambition, enticing Dale to punch him in the face. Brennan is awed that Dale stood up to Derek, while Derek's wife Alice finds Dale's courage attractive, and begins a sexual [[affair]] with him. Brennan and Dale discover their shared interests and develop a brotherly friendship. Robert schedules several job interviews for Brennan and Dale, in which they perform poorly. They are attacked and beaten up by school children on their way home and are made to lick dog feces. Robert and Nancy reveal their plans, with help from Derek, to sell the house, retire and travel the world on Robert's [[sailboat]]. They also demand that Brennan and Dale attend therapy and find other living arrangements. Brennan becomes attracted to his therapist, Denise.\n\nDale and Brennan start an [[entertainment company]], \"Prestige Worldwide\". They present their first [[music video]], \"Boats 'N Hoes\", which they filmed on Robert's boat, at Derek's birthday party. The presentation backfires when the video shows the boat crashing, shattering Robert and Nancy's sailing dreams. Robert is furious and conjures up an argument and insults Brennan, prompting Brennan to berate Robert as Nancy attempts to calm him down. On [[Christmas]], Robert and Nancy announce they are getting divorced, upsetting Brennan and Dale. Blaming each other for the divorce, Brennan and Dale decide to go their separate ways. Brennan works for Derek's helicopter leasing firm and Dale works for a [[catering]] company.\n\nWeeks later, Brennan and Dale are living independently as functioning adults and are doing well at their new jobs. Wanting to reunite the family, Brennan volunteers to oversee a prestigious event, the [[Santa Catalina Island (California)|Catalina]] Wine Mixer, for Derek's company and invites Robert and Nancy. They hire the catering company that employs Dale. The party is a success until the lead singer of the hired [[cover band]] loses his temper and is ejected. With the stage empty, Derek fires Brennan, blaming him for the debacle, and Robert ultimately encourages Brennan and Dale to be their eccentric child-at-heart selves again. Brennan and Dale take the stage and perform \"[[Con te partir\u00f2|Por Ti Volar\u00e9]]\". Derek is so moved by the performance that he and Brennan make amends. Dale ends his relationship with Alice, to her dismay.\n\nSix months later, Robert and Nancy are back together living in their old house, while Brennan and Dale have turned \"Prestige Worldwide\" into a successful entertainment company that hosts [[karaoke]] events. Robert has his boat turned into a [[tree house]] in the backyard and Denise confesses her attraction for Brennan.\n\nDuring the [[ending credits]], Dale and Brennan confront the school children who beat them up previously, and exact their revenge.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast list|\n* [[Will Ferrell]] as Brennan Huff\n** Bryce Hurless as young Brennan Huff\n* [[John C.
