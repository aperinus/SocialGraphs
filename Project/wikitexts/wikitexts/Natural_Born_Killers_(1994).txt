The film tells the story of two victims of traumatic childhoods who become lovers and [[mass murder]]ers, and are irresponsibly glorified by the mass media.\n\nThe film is based on an [[Quentin Tarantino's unrealized projects#Tarantino's Natural Born Killers|original screenplay]] by [[Quentin Tarantino]] that was heavily revised by Stone, writer David Veloz, and associate producer Richard Rutowski. Tarantino received a story credit though he subsequently disowned the film. [[Jane Hamsher]], [[Don Murphy]], and Clayton Townsend produced the film, with [[Arnon Milchan]], [[Thom Mount]], and Stone as executive producers.\n\n''Natural Born Killers'' was released on August 26, 1994 in the United States, and screened at the [[51st Venice International Film Festival|Venice Film Festival]] on August 29, 1994. It was a box office success, grossing $110 million against a production budget of $34 million, but received polarizing reviews. Some critics praised the plot, acting, humor, and combination of action and romance, while others found the film overly violent and graphic. Notorious for its violent content and inspiring [[Natural Born Killers copycat crimes|\"copycat\" crimes]], the film was named the eighth most controversial film in history by ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' in 2006.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20141006124153/http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,1202224_4,00.html 25 Most Controversial Movies Ever], Entertainment Weekly, 9 June 2006</ref>\n\n== Plot ==\nMickey Knox and his wife Mallory stop at a diner in the [[New Mexico]] desert. A duo of [[rednecks]] arrive and begin [[sexual harassment|sexually harassing]] Mallory as she dances by a jukebox. She initially encourages it before beating one of the men viciously. Mickey joins her, and the couple murder everyone in the diner, save one customer, to whom they proudly declare their names before leaving. The couple camp in the desert, and Mallory reminisces about how she met Mickey, a meat deliveryman who serviced her family's household. After a whirlwind romance, the couple had murdered Mallory's [[child sexual abuse|sexually abusive]] father and neglectful mother before having an unofficial marriage ceremony on a bridge.\n\nLater, Mickey and Mallory hold a woman hostage in their hotel room. Angered by Mickey's desire for a threesome, Mallory leaves, and Mickey rapes the hostage. Mallory drives to a nearby gas station, where she flirts with a mechanic. They begin to have sex on the hood of a car, but after Mallory suffers a [[Flashback (psychology)|flashback]] of being raped by her father and the mechanic recognizes her as a wanted murderer, Mallory kills him. The pair continue their killing spree, ultimately claiming 52 victims in New Mexico, [[Arizona]] and [[Nevada]]. Pursuing them is detective Jack Scagnetti, who became obsessed with mass murderers at the age of eight after having witnessed the murder of his mother at the hand of [[Charles Whitman]]. Beneath his heroic fa\u00e7ade, he is also a violent psychopath and has murdered prostitutes in his past. Following the pair's murder spree is self-serving tabloid journalist Wayne Gale, who profiles them on his show ''American Maniacs'', soon elevating them to cult-hero status.\n\nMickey and Mallory become lost in the desert after taking [[psilocybin|psychedelic mushrooms]], and they stumble upon a ranch owned by Warren Red Cloud, a [[Navajo people|Navajo]] man who provides them food and shelter. As Mickey and Mallory sleep, Warren, sensing evil in the couple, attempts to [[exorcism|exorcise]] the demon that he perceives in Mickey, chanting over him as he sleeps. Mickey, who has nightmares of his abusive parents, awakens during the exorcism and shoots Warren to death. As the couple flee, they feel inexplicably guilty and come across a giant field of [[rattlesnake]]s, where they are badly bitten. They reach a drugstore to purchase [[Antivenom|snakebite antidote]], but the store is sold out. A pharmacist recognizes the couple and triggers an alarm before Mickey kills him. Police arrive shortly after and accost the couple and a shootout ensues. The police end the showdown by beating the couple while a news crew films the action.\n\nOne year later, the imprisoned Mickey and Mallory are thought to be [[criminally insane]] and are scheduled to be transferred to [[psychiatric hospital]]s, with Scagnetti overseeing their transfer. Warden Dwight McClusky tells the detective that he should kill the Knoxes during their transfer and claim they had tried to escape. \n\nMeanwhile, Gale has persuaded Mickey to submit to a live interview that will air after the [[Super Bowl]]. During the interview, Mickey declares himself a \"natural born killer\", inspiring the other inmates to start a [[prison riot]]. After McClusky terminates the interview, Mickey is left alone with Gale, the film crew and several guards. He manages to overpower a guard and kill most of the people in the room, taking Gale and several others hostage. Gale and his crew give a live television report that profiles the riot. Meanwhile, when Scagnetti attempts to seduce Mallory in her cell, she beats him viciously before another guard subdues her with [[tear gas]]. Mickey and Gale reach Mallory's cell, where Mickey kills the guards and engages in a [[Mexican standoff]] with Scagnetti before Mallory kills Scagnetti.\n\nGale's entire television crew is killed trying to escape the riot, while Gale himself begins indulging in violence, shooting at prison guards. Mickey and Mallory steal a van and escape into the woods with Gale, to whom they give a final interview before declaring that he must die. He attempts various arguments to change their minds, appealing to their trademark practice of leaving one survivor. Mickey informs him that they are leaving a witness to tell the tale: his camera. Gale accepts his fate and is shot to death. Unbeknownst to the three, the entire exchange is transmitted to a horrified news anchor through Gale's in-ear microphone.\n\nSeveral years later, Mickey and Mallory, still fugitives, travel in an [[Recreational vehicle|RV]], as a pregnant Mallory watches their two children play.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{cast list|\n* [[Woody Harrelson]] as Mickey Knox\n* [[Juliette Lewis]] as Mallory Wilson Knox\n* [[Robert Downey Jr.]] as Wayne Gale\n* [[Tom Sizemore]] as Detective Jack Scagnetti\n* [[Tommy Lee Jones]] as Warden Dwight McClusky\n* [[Rodney Dangerfield]] as Ed Wilson\n* [[Edie McClurg]] as Mrs. Wilson\n* [[Sean Stone]] as Kevin Wilson\n* [[Russell Means]] as Old [[Native Americans in the United States|Indian]] Man\n* [[Lanny Flaherty]] as Earl\n* [[Evan Handler]] as David\n* [[Balthazar Getty]] as Gas station attendant\n* [[Richard Lineback]] as Sonny\n* [[Kirk Baltz]] as Roger\n* [[Steven Wright]] as Dr. Emil Reingold\n* [[Pruitt Taylor Vince]] as Deputy Warden Kavanaugh\n* [[Joe Grifasi]] as Deputy Sheriff Duncan Homolka\n* Everett Quinton as Deputy Wurlitzer\n* [[Marshall Bell]] as Deputy\n* [[Peter Crombie]] as Intense cop\n* [[Grand L.

He was keen to find something more straightforward than his previous production, ''[[Heaven & Earth (1993 film)|Heaven & Earth]]'' (1993), a difficult shoot which had left him exhausted.\n\nDavid Veloz, associate producer Richard Rutowski, and Stone rewrote Tarantino's script, keeping much of the dialogue but changing the focus of the film from journalist Wayne Gale to Mickey and Mallory.

Bramesco wrote, \"With every public bloodbath [in the news today], discourse inches closer to accepting their root cause as a combination of lax [[Overview of gun laws by nation|gun laws]] and an undercurrent of psychosis endemic to those feeling marginalized from society. Stone\u2019s inquest may have been a shock to the system at the time, but his tracing of that psychosis back to the evils of television scans as borderline reactionary to present-day sensibilities.\"<ref name=\"problem\" /> Bramesco also noted the film's inclusion of Native American mysticism into its plot felt like a \"white understanding of native culture.\"<ref name=\"problem\" />\n\nIn contrast, critic [[Owen Gleiberman]] said the film still \"captures how our parasitical relationship to pop culture can magnify the cycle of violence...'''Natural Born Killers''<nowiki/>' was the movie that glimpsed the looking glass we were passing through, the new psycho-metaphysical space we were living inside \u2014 the roller-coaster of images and advertisements, of entertainment and illusion, of demons that come up through fantasy and morph into daydreams, of vicarious violence that bleeds into real violence.\u201d<ref name=\"spectacle\" />\n\n=== Home media ===\n''Natural Born Killers'' was released on [[VHS]] in 1995 by [[Warner Home Video]].<ref>{{Cite book |title=Natural Born Killers [VHS] |asin=6303327982 }}</ref> A director's cut version of the film was released the following year on VHS by [[Trimark Pictures|Vidmark]]/[[Lionsgate Films|Lionsgate]], who also released a non-anamorphic DVD of the director's cut in 2000.<ref name=\"dvdtalk\">{{Cite web |last=Hartel, Nick |date=October 29, 2009 |title=Natural Born Killers: The Director's Cut |url=https://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/38562/natural-born-killers-directors-cut/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091104104305/https://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/38562/natural-born-killers-directors-cut/ |archive-date=November 4, 2009 |website=[[DVD Talk]]}}</ref> Distribution rights to Stone's director's cut reverted from Lionsgate to Warner Bros. in 2009, after which Warner issued an anamorphic DVD edition<ref name=dvdtalk /> as well as a [[Blu-ray]].<ref>{{Cite web |last=Dellamorte |first=Andrew |date=October 30, 2009 |title=NATURAL BORN KILLERS Unrated Director's Cut Blu-ray Review |url=http://collider.com/natural-born-killers-unrated-directors-cut-blu-ray-review/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190325232427/http://collider.com/natural-born-killers-unrated-directors-cut-blu-ray-review |archive-date=March 25, 2019 |website=[[Collider (website)|Collider]]}}</ref>\n\n== Controversies ==\n=== Quentin Tarantino ===\nAfter Quentin Tarantino attempted to publish his original screenplay to ''Natural Born Killers'' as a paperback book, as he had done with his scripts for ''[[True Romance]]'' and his own directorial efforts, ''[[Reservoir Dogs]]'' and ''[[Pulp Fiction]]'', the producers of ''Natural Born Killers'' filed a lawsuit against Tarantino, claiming that when he sold the script to them, he had forfeited the publishing rights; eventually, Tarantino was allowed to publish his original script.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Cinema: Tarantino v Stone |website=[[Independent.co.uk]] |date=October 23, 2011 |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/cinema-tarantino-v-stone-1592900.html |access-date=September 22, 2018 |archive-date=June 15, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180615005912/https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/cinema-tarantino-v-stone-1592900.html |url-status=live }}</ref> Tarantino disowned the film, saying, \"I hated that fucking movie.
