The title itself refers to the [[Olympic symbols#Motto and creed|Olympic motto]]: \"Faster, higher, stronger\", also a play on WWE's [[WrestleMania III]] theme \"Bigger, Better, Badder\".  The tagline also evokes the lines of the opening sequence of [[The Six Million Dollar Man]], \"Better, Stronger, Faster.\"{{Citation needed|date=June 2021}}\n\n==Synopsis==\nThe documentary examines the steroid use of director Christopher Bell's two brothers, Mark \"Smelly\" Bell and [[Mike Bell (wrestler)|Mike \"Mad Dog\" Bell]], who grew up idolizing [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]], [[Hulk Hogan]], and [[Sylvester Stallone]] (who all confessed to using steroids or growth hormones to achieve their physiques), and also features professional athletes, medical experts, fitness center members, and US Congressmen talking about the issue of [[anabolic steroid]]s.<ref name=mc/>\n\nBeyond the basic issue of anabolic steroid use, ''Bigger, Stronger, Faster*'' examines the lack of consistency in how the US views drugs, cheating, and the lengths people go to achieve success. The film looks beyond the steroid issue to such topics as [[Tiger Woods]]' laser eye correction to 20/15 vision, professional musicians use of blood pressure reducing drugs, or athletes' dependence on cortisone shots, which are a legal steroid. It takes a skeptical view of the health risks of steroids and is critical of the legal health [[supplement industry]].\n\nChristopher Bell on steroid regulation:  \"If you look at all the laws in our country, and at how and why things get banned, they don\u2019t actually fit into that category: They\u2019re not addictive, they don\u2019t actually kill people. I don\u2019t condone the stuff, but after three years of researching this, it seems like we should take another look.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vulture.com/2008/05/filmmaker_christopher_bell_on.html|title=Filmmaker Christopher Bell on 'Bigger, Stronger, Faster*,' Steroids, and How to Cheat at the Olympics|website=Vulture}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\nThe film received highly positive reviews from critics. The [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] surveyed {{nowrap|76 critics}} and, categorizing the reviews as positive or negative, assessed 73 as positive and 3 as negative for a 96% rating. Among the reviews, it determined an average rating of 7.70 out of 10.
