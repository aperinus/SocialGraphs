It is adapted from the first half of [[Bibhutibhushan Bandopadhyay|Bibhutibhushan Bannerjee's]] novel ''Aparajito.''<ref name=\"r94\">{{Harvnb|Robinson|2003|p=94}}</ref> It starts off where the previous film ''[[Pather Panchali]]'' (1955) ended, with Apu's family moving to [[Varanasi]], and chronicles Apu's life from childhood to adolescence in college.\n\nWhen Ray started making ''Pather Panchali'', he had no plans of following it up with a sequel. The critical and commercial success of the film prompted him to start making ''Aparajito''.{{sfn|Ray|2013|p=63}}{{Broken footnote|date=February 2020}} Unlike his previous venture, where he stayed faithful to the novel, Ray took some bold artistic decisions here, such as portraying the relationship between Apu and his mother in a very different manner from the book. As a result, in contrast to its predecessor, the film was not received well locally; Ray recalled that \"as for the suburban audience, it was shocked by the portrayal of the mother and son relationship, so sharply at variance with the conventional notion of mutual sweetness and devotion\".{{sfn|Ray|2013|p=42}}{{Broken footnote|date=February 2020}}\n\nCritical reception outside of India, however, was overwhelmingly positive.

Harihar is making headway in his new pursuits: praying, singing, and officiating among the [[ghat]]s on the sacred river [[Ganges]]. Harihar catches a fever and soon dies, however, and his wife Sarbajaya is forced to begin work as a maid. With the assistance of a great-uncle, Apu and his mother return to Bengal and settle in the village Mansapota. There Apu apprentices as a priest, but pines to attend the local school which his mother is persuaded to allow. He excels at his studies, impressing a visiting dignitary, and the headmaster takes special interest in him.\n\nWithin a few years, the teenaged Apu has done well enough to receive a scholarship to go to [[Kolkata]] for further studies. Sarbajaya feels abandoned and frightened by this, but gives in and lovingly packs his suitcase. Apu travels by train to the city and starts working at a printing press, after school hours, to subsist. He becomes more accustomed to the city life and feels out of place in the village. Sarbajaya expects visits from him, but he visits only a few times. Her loneliness and yearning for her son grow. She becomes seriously ill, but does not disclose her illness to Apu, lest his studies be disturbed. When Apu finally realises her poor health, he returns to the village to find that she has died. Bhabataran, Apu's great uncle, requests that he stay there and perform last rites of his mother. Apu replies that he will perform the last rites in [[Kolkata]] and begins his journey back to the city.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Still from Aparajito.jpg|thumb|Smaran Ghosal in ''Aparajito'']]\n* Pinaki Sengupta as Apurba \"Apu\" Roy (boy)\n* Smaran Ghosal as Apu (adolescent)\n* [[Kanu Banerjee]] as Harihar Roy, Apu's father\n* [[Karuna Banerjee]] as Sarbajaya Roy, Apu's mother\n* Ramani Ranjan Sengupta as Bhabataran, Sarbajaya's uncle and Apu's great uncle\n* Charu Prakash Ghosh as Nanda Babu\n* Subodh Ganguly as Headmaster\n\n==Production==\n\n=== Origin and development ===\n\n''Aparajito'' was based on the last fifth of the novel ''[[Pather Panchali (novel)|Pather Panchali]]'' and the first third of the novel ''Aparajito'' by Banerjee.{{sfn|Robinson|2003|p=94}} The novel ''Pather Panchali'' is a classic [[bildungsroman]] (a type of [[coming-of-age story]]) in the canon of [[Bengali literature]].{{sfn|Gokulsing|Dissanayake|2013|p=277}}{{sfn|Gugelberger|1996|p=173}} It first appeared as a [[serial (literature)|serial]] in a Calcutta periodical in 1928{{sfn|Robinson|1989|p=74}} and was published as a book the next year.<ref>{{cite book |last=Sekhar |first=Saumitra |year=2012 |chapter=Pather Panchali |chapter-url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Pather_Panchali |editor1-last=Islam |editor1-first=Sirajul |editor1-link=Sirajul Islam |editor2-last=Jamal |editor2-first=Ahmed A. |title=Banglapedia: National Encyclopedia of Bangladesh |edition=Second |publisher=[[Asiatic Society of Bangladesh]]}}</ref> According to Ray's biographer, Robinson, among the three films of the [[Apu trilogy]], ''Aparajito'' bears the closest resemblance with its literary source. Banerjee's depiction of the mother-son relation fascinated Ray. Robinson writes: \"Their relationship had some echoes on a purely psychological plane for him\". Ray was in particular moved by Banerjee's \"daring and profound revelation\", that \"for some time after Sarbajaya's death Apu becomes familiar with a strange sensation&nbsp;... his immediate reaction had been one of pleasure, like a surge of release&nbsp;... a delight in the breaking of bonds&nbsp;... there was no doubt he loved his mother, but the news of her death had at first brought him pleasure\u2014he couldn't avoid the truth.\"<ref name=\"r94\" /> Ray's wife [[Bijoya Ray|Bijoya]] also voiced her concerns when she discovers the plot, asking him \"Do you think people in our country will accept a son's relief at having won his freedom at his mother's death?\" Ray was aware of the risk, saying \"let's see what happens. After all, later Apu was full of regret at his initial reaction upon his mother's death. And as he realized, her death actually came as a very big blow to him.\"{{sfn|Ray|2012|pp=153}}\n\n===Script and crew===\nThe novels had a female character named Leela who influenced Apu's alienation from his mother when he was living in Calcutta. After rejecting two aspirants, Ray found one actress to portray the character, but the actress was not allowed to act in the film by her fianc\u00e9. Eventually, Ray removed the character from the script reluctantly.{{sfn|Robinson|2003|p=94}} Ray himself later commented that he thought Leela, with whom Apu had an understated affair, was a strong reason behind Apu's attraction of Calcutta, and that without Leela's presence in the film, Apu's attraction to Calcutta may seem to some extent artificial. \"I'm never sure,\" he said, \"whether Apu's attachment to the city without the element of the girlfriend is strong enough, the pull that the city exerts is a bit abstract.\" However, when he watched the movie later, he did not feel the absence of Leela.{{sfn|Robinson|2003|pp=94\u201395}}\n\n[[Subrata Mitra]], the cinematographer for ''The Apu Trilogy'', made his first technical innovation with this film: the application of [[Reflector (photography)#Bounce lighting|bounce lighting]] on large scale diffusers to match studio sets with location shooting. According to the Internet Encyclopedia of Cinematographers:<ref name=\"cinematographers\">{{Citation |title=Subrata Mitra |publisher=Internet Encyclopedia of Cinematographers |url=http://www.cinematographers.nl/GreatDoPh/mitra.htm |access-date=22 May 2009}}</ref>\n\n<blockquote>The fear of monsoon rain had forced the art director, Bansi Chandragupta, to abandon the original plan to build the inner courtyard of a typical Benares house in the open and the set was built inside a studio in Calcutta. Mitra recalls arguing in vain with both Chandragupta and Ray about the impossibilities of simulating shadowless diffused skylight. But this led him to innovate what became subsequently his most important tool\u2014bounce lighting. Mitra placed a framed painter white cloth over the set resembling a patch of sky and arranged studio lights below to bounce off the fake sky.</blockquote>\n\n==Critical reception==\nThe film has been enthusiastically received by critics. [[James Berardinelli]] wrote:\n\n<blockquote>''Aparajito'' was filmed forty years ago, half way around the world, yet the themes and emotions embedded in the narrative are strikingly relevant to modern Western society (thus explaining why it is called a \"timeless classic\").&nbsp;... ''Aparajito'' is an amazing motion picture. Its rich, poetic composition is perfectly wed to the sublime emotional resonance of the narrative. For those who have seen ''Pather Panchali'', ''Aparajito'' provides a nearly-flawless continuation of the journey begun there. Yet, for those who missed Ray's earlier effort, this film loses none of its impact. On its own or as part of the Apu Trilogy, ''Aparajito'' should not be missed.<ref>James Berardinelli. [http://preview.reelviews.net/movies/a/aparajito.html Reel Reviews] URL accessed on 3 April 2006</ref></blockquote>\n\n[[Roger Ebert]] said, \"the relationship between Apu and his mother observes truths that must exist in all cultures: how the parent makes sacrifices for years, only to see the child turn aside and move thoughtlessly away into adulthood.&nbsp;... It is about a time, place and culture far removed from our own, and yet it connects directly and deeply with our human feelings. It is like a prayer, affirming that this is what the cinema can be, no matter how far in our cynicism we may stray.\"<ref name=\"ebert\" />\n\nDuring the [[Venice Film Festival]], [[Penelope Houston (film critic)|Penelope Houston]], who was among the jury, broke protocol and told Ray personally: \"I think it was magnificent\".{{sfn|Ray|2012|pp=167}} The chairman of the award ceremony, [[Ren\u00e9 Clair]], was initially reluctant to give it the coveted prize; he eventually acquiesced, but not before saying to Houston: \"I hope Ray will go away and learn how to make films!\" {{sfn|Robinson|2003|pp=105}} The Japanese director [[Akira Kurosawa]] had an important film entered in that year's festival competition, ''[[Throne of Blood]]'' (''Kumonosu-j\u014d''), which lost to Ray's film. However, many years later, Kurosawa's daughter generated a list of 100 films admired by him; this list quoted him as having affirmed the jury's choice as \"Absolutely right\" (though he misidentified the winning film as ''Pather Pancheli'').<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.movieforums.com/community/showthread.php?t=23480 |title=Akira Kurosawa's Top 100 Films \u2013 Movie Forums |access-date=2015-05-20}}</ref>\n\n[[Emanuel Levy]] said: \"Made in 1956 (and released in many countries a year later), 'Aparajito' indicates India's processes of modernization and industrialization and their inevitable impact on both individual and culture.
