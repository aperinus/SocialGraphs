The screenplay, by [[Sarah Y. Mason]] and [[Victor Heerman]], is based on the 1868-69 two-volume novel [[Little Women|of the same name]], by [[Louisa May Alcott]].\n\nThis is the third screen adaptation of the book. It follows two [[Silent film|silent versions]], the [[Little Women (1917 film)|first]] released in 1917 with [[Minna Grey]] and the [[Little Women (1918 film)|second]] in 1918 with [[Dorothy Bernard]]. After this 1933 sound version came the 1949 ''[[Little Women (1949 film)|Little Women]]'', with [[June Allyson]], [[Elizabeth Taylor]] and [[Peter Lawford]], the 1994 film ''[[Little Women (1994 film)|Little Women]]'', starring [[Winona Ryder]], and the 2019 film ''[[Little Women (2019 film)|Little Women]]'' featuring [[Saoirse Ronan]].\n\n==Plot==\nSet in [[Concord, Massachusetts]], during and after the [[American Civil War]], the film is a series of [[vignette (literature)|vignette]]s focusing on the struggles and adventures of the four March sisters and their mother, affectionately known as Marmee ([[Spring Byington]]), while they await the return of their father ([[Samuel S. Hinds]]), who serves as a colonel and a chaplain in the [[Union Army]]. Spirited [[tomboy]] Jo ([[Katharine Hepburn]]), who caters to the whims of their well-to-do Aunt March ([[Edna May Oliver]]), dreams of becoming a famous author, and she writes plays for her sisters to perform for the local children. Amy ([[Joan Bennett]]) is pretty but selfish, Meg ([[Frances Dee]]) works as a governess, and sensitive Beth ([[Jean Parker]]) practices on her [[clavichord]], an aging instrument sorely in need of tuning.\n\nThe girls meet Laurie ([[Douglass Montgomery]]), who has come to live with his grandfather, Mr. Laurence ([[Henry Stephenson]]), the Marches' wealthy next-door neighbor. The Laurences invite them to a lavish party, where Meg meets Laurie's tutor, John Brooke ([[John Davis Lodge|John Lodge]]). During the next several months John courts Meg, Jo's first short story becomes published, and Beth often takes advantage of Mr. Laurence's offer for her to practice on his piano.\n\nMarmee learns that her husband is recuperating in a hospital in Washington, D.C., after an injury, so she goes to Washington to care for him. During her absence Beth contracts [[scarlet fever]] from a neighbor's baby. She recovers, albeit in a weakened condition. The March parents return, and Meg marries John. Laurie confesses his love to Jo, who rejects him. When he snubs her in return, Jo moves to New York City to pursue her writing career, and she lives in a [[boarding house]]. There she meets Professor Bhaer ([[Paul Lukas]]), an impoverished German [[Linguistics|linguist]]. With his help and encouragement Jo improves her writing, and she resolves her confused feelings about Laurie.\n\nBeth, debilitated, is near to death, so Jo returns to Concord to be with Beth and her family during this time. After Beth dies, a grieving Jo learns that Amy, who accompanied Aunt March to Europe, has fallen in love with Laurie, accepted his proposal and they return, having married. Upon their return, Jo is happy for Laurie and Amy, indicating it has turned out as it always should have been.  Professor Bhaer then arrives from New York City, and with him he brings Jo's manuscript for Little Women, which is soon to be published. He confesses his love to Jo and proposes. Jo accepts, welcoming him to the family.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Katharine Hepburn]] as Josephine \"Jo\" March\n* [[Joan Bennett]] as Amy March\n* [[Frances Dee]] as Margaret \"Meg\" March \n* [[Jean Parker]] as Elizabeth \"Beth\" March\n* [[Spring Byington]] as Marmee March\n* [[Douglass Montgomery]] as Theodore \"Laurie\" Laurence\n* [[Paul Lukas]] as Professor Bhaer\n* [[Edna May Oliver]] as Aunt March\n* [[Henry Stephenson]] as Mr. Laurence\n* [[John Davis Lodge]] as Brooke\n* [[Samuel S.

It matters not that this chronicle is without a hero, or even a villain, for the absence of such worthies, usually extravagantly drawn, causes one to be quite contented to dwell for the moment with human hearts of the old-fashioned days.

By the time the 1933 film was made the United States was in the midst of [[Great Depression in the United States|Great Depression]] and would be fighting in [[World War II]] in the near future. References that were once meant to be about the Civil War became all too relatable for audiences. Especially at the beginning of the film, the constant emphasis on food, frugality, conservation, activism, social reform, and want for family and morality are just a short list of the ideals that transferred directly from the Civil War era to the mindsets of Americans in the Great Depression. Cukor's focus on hardship and relief partnered with intense familial commitment creates a nostalgic and sentimental picture of joyfulness, moral improvement, and social progression. The 1933 film became a trademark of&nbsp; \u201can activist spirit grounded in unbreakable ties to family and community\u201d as the March girls represent the hope and determination that was prominent during both the Civil War and the Great Depression.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n*Koszarski, Richard. 1976.
