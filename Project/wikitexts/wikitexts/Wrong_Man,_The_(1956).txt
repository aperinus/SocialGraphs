When he visits the office of a life insurance company to borrow money against Rose's policy, he is mistaken by the staff there for a man who had twice held them up.\n\nHe is questioned by the police, who call him \"Chris\" rather than Manny, and tell him that they are looking for a man who had robbed the insurance company and other businesses and that he ''might'' be their man. Manny is instructed to walk in and out of a liquor store and a [[delicatessen]] which had also been robbed by the same man. He is then asked to write the words from a stick-up note used by the robber in the insurance company robbery; he misspells the word \"drawer\" as \"draw\"{{snd}}the same mistake made in the robber's note. After being picked out of a [[police lineup]] by an employee of the insurance company who had witnessed the robberies he is arrested on charges of armed robbery.\n\nAttorney [[Frank D. O'Connor|Frank O'Connor]] ([[Anthony Quayle]]) sets out to prove that Manny cannot possibly be the right man: at the time of the first hold-up he was on vacation with his family, and at the time of the second his jaw was so swollen that witnesses would certainly have noticed. Of three people who saw the boy fall at the vacation hotel, two have died and the third cannot be found. All this devastates Rose, whose resulting [[depression (mood)|depression]] forces her to be hospitalized.\n\nDuring Manny's trial he prays the [[rosary]] after his mother urges him to pray for strength. A juror's remark forces a [[trial (law)#Mistrials|mistrial]]. While awaiting a second trial Manny is exonerated when the true robber is arrested holding up a grocery store. Manny visits Rose at the hospital to share the good news, but, as the film ends, she remains severely depressed; a textual epilogue explains that she recovered two years later.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Henry Fonda]] as Christopher Emmanuel \"Manny\" Balestrero\n* [[Vera Miles]] as Rose Balestrero\n* [[Anthony Quayle]] as [[Frank D.
