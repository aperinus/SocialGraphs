It was released in theaters on March 9, 2012, four years after it was filmed, to negative reviews from critics, receiving a [[List of films with a 0% rating on Rotten Tomatoes|0% rating]] on review aggregator [[Rotten Tomatoes]]. It was a [[Box-office bomb|box office bomb]], having grossed just $22 million worldwide on a $40 million budget.\n\n== Plot ==\n[[Literary agent]] Jack McCall uses his \"gift of gab\" to get various book deals, and he is not afraid to stretch the truth to get them. While he is trying to get a deal from New Age self-help guru Dr. Sinja, he sees through Jack's deceit and agrees to the deal, only to later deliver a five-page book.\n\nThat night, a [[Bodhi Tree]] appears in Jack's backyard. Dr. Sinja goes to his house and they discover that for every word Jack speaks, a leaf falls off of the tree. When the tree runs out of leaves, it will die, as will Jack. He finds that even written words and gestures towards words count towards his limit; plus anything that happens to the tree also affects him. When Jack tries to cut it down with an axe, a wound appears on him. When squirrels climb the tree, it tickles him. When a gardener tries to poison it with [[DDT]], Jack gets high on the fumes and when the gardener tries to water it, Jack starts to sweat and perspire profusely.\n\nWith Jack forced to choose his words carefully, communication becomes difficult and full of misunderstandings. These cost him two book deals, his job, his wife Caroline and his son, Tyler. She walks out on him when she thinks his sudden silence is due to him not loving her anymore. When he tries to explain the tree to her, she doesn't believe him. Only Jack's assistant Aaron Weisberger realizes he is telling the truth, and goes to his house to keep track of how many leaves remain. Jack tries to break the curse by being a better person by giving food to the homeless, and donating some of his money to charity, but that plan fails. Jack drinks a lot of alcohol in the night, causing him to sing a lot, thus making the tree lose most of its leaves. Only when Aaron confronts him and tackles him to the ground does he stop speaking and fall asleep.\n\nWith his life falling apart and the tree running out of leaves, Jack confronts Dr. Sinja and asks how to end the curse. The guru tells him to make peace in all of his relationships. With just one branch of leaves left, Jack tries to reconcile with his wife, but she remains hesitant. He visits his mother Annie, who lives in an assisted-living center and has dementia. Annie tells Jack, who she thinks is his late father Raymond, that she wishes Jack would stop being angry at his father for walking out on them when he was a kid. Realizing this is the relationship that needs the most mending, he goes to visit his father's grave. Jack expends the last three leaves of the tree with the words \"I forgive you\". With no leaves remaining, he suffers a heart attack in a storm and appears to die. Aaron then calls Jack on his cell phone. Still alive, Jack answers his phone. Aaron tells him the tree's leaves have magically reappeared and Jack can now talk freely again.\n\nJack and Caroline get back together, with him buying the family-friendly house Caroline had asked for, with the tree in their front yard. Although he does not get his job back (Aaron was promoted to Jack's old position), he writes a book about his experience, called ''A Thousand Words'', and gets Aaron to make the deal. Unfortunately for Aaron, the promotion causes him to be like Jack was, thus he gets his own smaller office Bodhi Tree.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Eddie Murphy]] as  Jack McCall\n* [[Kerry Washington]] as Caroline McCall\n* [[Clark Duke]] as Aaron Wiseberger\n* [[Cliff Curtis]] as Dr. Sinja\n* [[Allison Janney]] as Samantha Davis\n* [[Ruby Dee]] as Annie McCall (Jack's Mother)\n* [[Jack McBrayer]] as [[Starbucks]] coffee employee\n* [[Steve Little (actor)|Steve Little]] as Co-worker\n* [[John Witherspoon (actor)|John Witherspoon]] as Blind old man\n* [[Kayla Blake]] as Emily\n* Lennie Loftin as Robert Gilmore\n* [[Alain Chabat]] as Christian L\u00e9ger de la Touffe\n* Ted Kennedy as Homeless man\n* Emanuel Ragsdale as Tyler McCall\n}}\n\n== Production ==\n''A Thousand Words'' was filmed in August 2008 in [[Los Angeles, California]] and was supposed to be released in 2009,  but was repeatedly delayed after being caught up in the separation of [[DreamWorks Pictures]] from [[Paramount Pictures]] and [[Viacom (2005\u2013present)|Viacom]].<ref name=\"Slashfilm\">{{cite web |url=https://www.slashfilm.com/shelved-eddie-murphy-film-a-thousand-words-january-2012-release-date |title=Shelved Eddie Murphy Film 'A Thousand Words' Gets January 2012 Release Date |work=[[/Film]] |date=2011-04-21 |access-date=2012-03-09}}</ref> During an interview for ''[[Fred: The Movie]]'', director [[Brian Robbins]] stated that the film would be released in 2011.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://collider.com/brian-robbins-interview-fred-the-movie-lucas-cruikshank/48767 |title=Director Brian Robbins Exclusive Interview FRED: THE MOVIE; Plus an Update on A THOUSAND WORDS Starring Eddie Murphy |work=Collider.com |access-date=November 12, 2011}}</ref> Reshoots were done on the film early in 2011.<ref name=\"Slashfilm\" />\n\nThe film was then scheduled for a January 2012 release, but after Murphy was announced as the host of the 2012 [[Academy Award|Oscar]] ceremony (he later stepped down),<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/nov/09/eddie-murphy-quits-oscars-homophobia-row |title=Eddie Murphy quits Oscars after homophobia row |access-date=November 20, 2011 | location=London |work=The Guardian |first=David |last=Batty |date=November 9, 2011}}</ref> the film was given a date of March 23, 2012;<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.slashfilm.com/paramount-realizes-oscar-hosting-gig-huge-commercial-eddie-murphy-movies-moves-a-thousand-words-march-2012 |title=Paramount Realizes Oscars Are Huge Commercial For Eddie Murphy, Moves 'A Thousand Words' to March 2012 |work=[[/Film]] |date=16 September 2011 |access-date=November 12, 2011}}</ref> this was later pushed to April 20, 2012,<ref>[https://www.deadline.com/2012/01/paramount-shifts-release-dates-for-hansel-and-gretel-two-other-pics \"'Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters' Delays To 2013 So Jeremy Renner More Of Global Draw\"].
