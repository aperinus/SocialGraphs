Based on le Carr\u00e9's  [[The Tailor of Panama|1996 novel of the same name]], it stars [[Pierce Brosnan]] and [[Geoffrey Rush]]. Rush portrays the title character, a former convict turned tailor who is strong-armed by an amoral [[Secret Intelligence Service|MI6]] agent (Brosnan) into spying on the [[Panama]]nian government. [[Jamie Lee Curtis]], [[Brendan Gleeson]], [[Catherine McCormack]], [[Leonor Varela]], and [[Harold Pinter]] co-star, along with [[Daniel Radcliffe]] in his film debut.\n\nThe film premiered at the [[Berlin International Film Festival]] on February 11, 2001, and was released theatrically in the United States by [[Columbia Pictures]] on March 30. It received positive reviews, with praise for the performances of Brosnan and Rush, and grossed $28 million on a $21 million budget.\n\n== Plot ==\nAndy Osnard is an [[Secret Intelligence Service|MI6]] spy reassigned to [[Panama]] after having an affair in Madrid with the foreign minister's mistress. His superior warns him of the corruption present in Panama, but Osnard views that as an opportunity. Consulting a list of British citizens residing in Panama, he meets Harry Pendel, the tailor to many of Panama's elite, including the President. Pendel, a gifted storyteller, passes himself off as being formerly of [[Savile Row]], but is in fact an ex-con who used to run scams with his late uncle Benny. Pendel's American wife Louisa, the assistant to the administrator of the [[Panama Canal Authority]], is unaware of his criminal record. While Harry is a superb tailor, he is a bad businessman; his tailor shop is constantly in debt, and he owes $50,000 of Louisa's money to the bank for a farming business that failed.\n\nKnowing that Pendel needs money, Osnard offers to help him, if Pendel feeds him information about the elite of Panama City. Pendel agrees, and uses the money to pay off his debts and help his friend Mickie, a down-on-his-luck [[alcoholic]], and his assistant Marta, who was raped and disfigured by [[Manuel Noriega]]'s soldiers. However, Osnard soon requires better information, threatening to cut off the money and reveal that Pendel has been spying for a foreign government if he does not get what he wants.\n\nPendel starts \"tailoring\" his stories, escalating the roles of friends to make them appear more significant than they are. He casts Mickie as a revolutionary who still holds sway over the youth of Panama, and his shop manager as the leader of an opposition movement. After fixing the suit of the President of Panama (whose conversation consisted of his suit being too tight), he comes up with a tale that the president intends to sell the canal to China. When an incredulous Osnard asks which, [[Beijing]] or [[Taiwan]], Pendel replies \"both\". Osnard knows that Pendel is making up these stories, but does not care as long as his superiors believe them.\n\nAs he passes along this misinformation (bypassing the embassy staff, apart from Francesca, a staffer he is sleeping with), it makes its way to [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]], where military and government officials are alarmed and plan an invasion to prevent the canal from falling into Chinese hands. Pendel, meanwhile, seeks to end his spying, saying the opposition won't listen to him because it needs $10 million. He thinks the figure will put Osnard off, but Osnard relays a request to fund the opposition as a means to control Panama after this supposed revolution; he asks for $''15'' million, which is granted by the [[The Pentagon|Pentagon]]. Osnard's superior arrives with a briefcase containing the money, ready to meet with the opposition, while American attack helicopters are preparing for an assault on the city.\n\nThe British Ambassador uncovers what Osnard has been up to, and threatens to reveal everything. Osnard pays for his silence and cooperation with $1.25 million. Osnard manages to ditch his superior and make off with the briefcase. Meanwhile, Pendel gets a call from Marta, who tells him that Mickie has committed suicide out of fear that he would go to prison for his supposed revolutionary ties. Pendel blames himself for Mickie's death, and resolves to thwart Osnard's plans. He waylays Osnard as he flees to the airport, but Osnard gives him the slip.\n\nLouisa finds out what Pendel has been doing and races to the Administrator's office. The Administrator contacts the President of Panama, who is able to contact the U.S. government and have the invasion called off shortly after it began. During the confusion, Osnard makes it to the airport, where he meets the Ambassador and hands him his bribe. The Ambassador allows Osnard to make it to an airplane.\n\nPendel returns home to Louisa and tells her about his criminal past, and she forgives him. Osnard, meanwhile, escapes the country with the money.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Pierce Brosnan]] as Andrew \"Andy\" Osnard\n* [[Geoffrey Rush]] as Harold \"Harry\" Pendel\n* [[Jamie Lee Curtis]] as Louisa Pendel\n* [[Leonor Varela]] as Marta\n* [[Brendan Gleeson]] as Michelangelo \"Mickie\" Abraxas\n* [[Harold Pinter]] as Uncle Benny\n* [[Catherine McCormack]] as Francesca Deane\n* [[Martin Ferrero]] as Teddy, The Reporter\n* [[Daniel Radcliffe]] as Mark Pendel\n* Lola Boorman as Sarah Pendel\n* [[David Hayman]] as Luxmore\n* [[Mark Margolis]] as Rafi Domingo\n* [[John Fortune]] as Maltby\n* [[Jon Polito]] as Ramon Rudd\n* [[Dylan Baker]] as General Dusenbake\n* [[Jonathan Hyde]] as Cavendish\n* [[Lisa Dwan]] as Stewardess \n}}\n\n== Production ==\n''The Tailor of Panama'' was shot at the [[Ardmore Studios]] in [[County Wicklow]], Ireland, and on location in [[Panama City]], [[Lake Gatun]], and [[Gamboa, Panama]]. It was produced by Boorman's Irish production company Merlin Films, with financial support from [[Columbia Pictures]].\n\nLike the novel, the film is inspired by [[Graham Greene]]'s 1958 novel ''[[Our Man in Havana]]'', which depicts intelligence agencies believing reports from local informants in [[Cuba]]. Whereas the novel was set in the 1990s, before the American withdrawal from the [[Panama Canal Zone]], the film moves the time period to the 21st century.\n\nIn the original ending of the film Osnard is shot by Pendell. This was changed to allow Osnard to escape.\n\n== Reception ==\nThe film holds a 76% approval rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] with an average rating of 6.80/10 based on 117 reviews. The site's consensus states: \"''The Tailor of Panama'' is a smart, darkly satirical thriller with exuberant performances from Pierce Brosnan and Geoffrey Rush.\"<ref>{{Rotten Tomatoes}}</ref> On [[Metacritic]], it holds a score of 66 out of 100 based on reviews from 31 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".<ref>{{Metacritic film}}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{IMDb title}}\n* {{allrovi movie|239449|The Tailor of Panama}}\n\n{{John Boorman}}\n{{John le Carr\u00e9}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Tailor Of Panama, The}}\n[[Category:2001 films]]\n[[Category:2000s spy films]]\n[[Category:2000s thriller drama films]]\n[[Category:American thriller drama films]]\n[[Category:Irish drama films]]\n[[Category:English-language Irish films]]\n[[Category:2000s Spanish-language films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by John Boorman]]\n[[Category:Films based on works by John le Carr\u00e9]]\n[[Category:Films about the Secret Intelligence Service]]\n[[Category:Films set in Panama]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Ireland]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Panama]]\n[[Category:Films shot in the Republic of Ireland]]\n[[Category:Columbia Pictures films]]\n[[Category:2001 drama films]]\n[[Category:2000s English-language films]]\n[[Category:2000s American films]]"}]}}}}
