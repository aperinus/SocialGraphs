It stars [[John Travolta]] as Tony Manero, a young [[Italian-American]] man from the [[Brooklyn]] borough of [[New York City|New York]]. Manero spends his weekends dancing and drinking at a local [[Nightclub|discoth\u00e8que]] while dealing with social tensions and disillusionment, feeling directionless and trapped in his [[working-class]] ethnic neighborhood. The story is based on \"[[Tribal Rites of the New Saturday Night]]\", a mostly fictional article by music writer [[Nik Cohn]], first published in a June 1976 issue of ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' magazine. The film features music by the [[Bee Gees]] and many other prominent [[disco|artists of the disco era]].\n\nA major critical and commercial success, ''Saturday Night Fever'' had a tremendous impact on [[popular culture]] of the late 1970s. The film helped to popularize [[disco music]] around the world and initiated a series of collaborations between film studios and record labels. It also made Travolta, already well known from his role in the TV sitcom ''[[Welcome Back, Kotter]]'', a household name. He was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Actor]] for his performance, becoming the [[List of oldest and youngest Academy Award winners and nominees#Best Actor in a Leading Role|fifth-youngest nominee]] in the category. The film showcases aspects of the music, dancing, and [[subculture]] surrounding the disco era, including symphony-orchestrated melodies, [[haute couture]] styles of clothing, pre-[[AIDS]] sexual promiscuity, and graceful choreography. The [[Saturday Night Fever (soundtrack)|''Saturday Night Fever'' soundtrack]], featuring disco songs by the [[Bee Gees]], is one of the best-selling soundtracks in history.<ref>[https://www.usatoday.com/life/music/news/2003-01-12-maurice-gibbs-obit_x.htm Bee Gees' Maurice Gibb dies]. USA Today (January 12, 2003).</ref>  John Travolta reprised his role of Tony Manero in ''[[Staying Alive (1983 film)|Staying Alive]]'' in 1983, which was panned by critics despite being successful at the box office.\n\nIn 2010, ''Saturday Night Fever'' was deemed \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\" by the [[Library of Congress]] and selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]].\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for featured film articles should be 400-700 words. -->\nTony Manero is a 19-year-old [[Italian-American]] from the [[Bay Ridge]] neighborhood of [[Brooklyn]], New York. He lives with his parents, grandmother, and younger sister, and works at a [[dead-end job]] in a small [[paint store]]. To escape his day-to-day life, Tony goes to 2001 Odyssey, a local [[discotheque]], where he is king of the dance floor and receives the admiration and respect he craves. Tony has four close Italian-American friends from the neighborhood: Joey, Double J, Gus, and Bobby C. A fringe member of his group of friends is Annette, a neighborhood girl who is infatuated with Tony; however, he is not attracted to her.\n\nTony and his friends ritually stop on the [[Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge]] to clown around. The bridge has special significance for Tony as a symbol of escape to a better life.\n\nTony agrees to be Annette's partner in an upcoming dance contest, but her happiness is short-lived when Tony is mesmerized by another woman at the club, Stephanie Mangano, whose dancing skills exceed Annette's. Although Stephanie rejects Tony's advances, she eventually agrees to be his partner in the dance competition, provided that their partnership remains professional.\n\nFrank Jr., Tony's older brother and the pride of the family as a Roman Catholic priest, brings despair to their parents and grandmother when he tells them he has quit the priesthood. Tony shares a warm relationship with Frank Jr., but Tony feels pleased that he is no longer the [[black sheep]] of the family.  Frank Jr. tells Tony that he never wanted to be a priest and only did it to make their parents happy. He also encourages Tony to do something with his dancing.\n\nWhile on his way home from the grocery store, Gus is attacked by a gang and hospitalized. He tells Tony and his friends that his attackers were the Barracudas, a Puerto Rican gang.  Meanwhile, Bobby C. has been trying to get out of his relationship with his devout Catholic girlfriend, Pauline, who is pregnant with his child. Facing pressure from his family and others to marry her, Bobby asks Frank Jr. if the [[Pope]] would grant him [[Papal dispensation|dispensation]] for an abortion. When Frank tells him such a thing would be highly unlikely, Bobby's feelings of desperation increase.\n\nEventually, the group gets their revenge on the Barracudas and crash Bobby C's car into their hangout. Tony, Double J, and Joey get out of the car to fight, but Bobby C. runs away when a gang member tries to attack him in the car. When the group visits Gus in the hospital, they are angry when he tells them that he may have identified the wrong gang. Later, Tony and Stephanie dance at the competition and end up winning first prize. However, Tony believes that a Puerto Rican couple performed better, and that the judges' decision was ethnically motivated. He gives the Puerto Rican couple his trophy and award money and leaves with Stephanie. Once inside Bobby's car, Stephanie mocks Tony and tells him she was using him.  Tony tries to rape Stephanie, but she resists and runs from him.\n\nTony's friends come to the car along with an intoxicated Annette. Joey says she has agreed to have sex with everyone. Tony tries to lead her away but is subdued by Double J and Joey and sullenly leaves with the group in the car. Joey has sex with Annette in the back seat of the car. After Joey finishes with Annette, he switches places with Double J who then proceeds to rape Annette despite her loud protests, with Tony clearly uncomfortable with the situation in the front seat. Bobby C. pulls the car over on the Verrazzano\u2013Narrows Bridge for their usual cable-climbing antics. Instead of abstaining as usual, Bobby performs stunts more recklessly than the rest of the gang. Realizing that he is acting recklessly, Tony tries to get him to come down. Bobby's strong sense of despair, the situation with Pauline, and Tony's broken promise to call him earlier that day all lead to a suicidal tirade about Tony's lack of caring, before Bobby slips and falls to his death in the water below.\n\nDisgusted and disillusioned by his friends, his family, and his life, Tony angrily storms off, leaving Double J, Joey, and Annette behind. He spends the rest of the night riding the graffiti-riddled subway into [[Manhattan]]. Morning has dawned by the time he appears at Stephanie's apartment. He apologizes for his bad behavior, telling her that he plans to relocate from Brooklyn to Manhattan to try to start a new life. Stephanie forgives Tony, and tells him that she was wrong to say she was using him, and that she danced with him because he gave her respect and moral support.  Tony and Stephanie salvage their relationship and agree to be friends.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col}}\n* [[John Travolta]] as Anthony \"Tony\" Manero\n* [[Karen Lynn Gorney]] as Stephanie Mangano\n* [[Barry Miller (actor)|Barry Miller]] as Bobby C.\n* [[Joseph Cali]] as Joey\n* [[Paul Pape]] as Double J.\n* [[Donna Pescow]] as Annette\n* [[Bruce Ornstein]] as Gus\n* [[Val Bisoglio]] as Frank Manero, Sr.\n* [[Julie Bovasso]] as Flo Manero\n* [[Martin Shakar]] as Frank Manero, Jr.\n* [[Lisa Peluso]] as Linda Manero\n* Nina Hansen as Grandmother\n* [[Sam Coppola]] as Dan Fusco\n* [[Denny Dillon]] as Doreen\n* Bert Michaels as Pete\n* [[Fran Drescher]] as Connie\n* [[Monti Rock|Monti Rock III]] as the [[Disc jockey|DJ]]\n* Robert Weil as Becker\n* Shelly Batt as Girl in Disco\n* Donald Gantry as Jay Langhart\n* Ellen March as Bartender\n* William Andrews as Detective\n* [[Robert Costanzo]] as paint store customer\n* Helen Travolta (John's mother) as paint store customer\n* Ann Travolta (John's sister) as pizza girl\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Music==\n===Soundtrack===\n{{Main|Saturday Night Fever (soundtrack)}}\n\n# \"[[Stayin' Alive]]\" performed by the [[Bee Gees]] \u2013 4:45\n# \"[[How Deep Is Your Love (Bee Gees song)|How Deep Is Your Love]]\" performed by Bee Gees \u2013 4:05\n# \"[[Night Fever]]\" performed by Bee Gees \u2013 3:33\n# \"[[More Than a Woman (Bee Gees song)|More Than a Woman]]\" performed by Bee Gees \u2013 3:17\n# \"[[If I Can't Have You (Bee Gees song)|If I Can't Have You]]\" performed by [[Yvonne Elliman]] \u2013 3:00\n# \"[[A Fifth of Beethoven]]\" performed by [[Walter Murphy]] \u2013 3:03\n# \"[[More Than a Woman (Bee Gees song)|More Than a Woman]]\" performed by [[Tavares (group)|Tavares]] \u2013 3:17\n# \"Manhattan Skyline\" performed by [[David Shire]] \u2013 4:44\n# \"Calypso Breakdown\" performed by [[Ralph MacDonald]] \u2013 7:50\n# \"[[Night on Bald Mountain|Night on Disco Mountain]]\" performed by David Shire \u2013 5:12\n# \"Open Sesame\" performed by [[Kool & the Gang]] \u2013 4:01\n# \"[[Jive Talkin']]\" performed by Bee Gees \u2013 3:43 (*)\n# \"[[You Should Be Dancing]]\" performed by Bee Gees \u2013 4:14\n# \"[[Boogie Shoes]]\" performed by [[KC and the Sunshine Band]] \u2013 2:17\n# \"Salsation\" performed by David Shire \u2013 3:50\n# \"[[K-Jee]]\" performed by [[MFSB]] \u2013 4:13\n# \"[[Disco Inferno]]\" performed by [[The Trammps]] \u2013 10:51\n:With the exception of (*) track 12 \"''Jive Talkin''\", all of the songs are played in the film.\n:The novelty songs \"Dr. Disco\" and \"[[Disco Duck]]\", both performed by Rick Dees, are played in the film but not included on the album.\n\nAccording to the DVD commentary for ''Saturday Night Fever'', the producers intended to use the song \"Lowdown\" by [[Boz Scaggs]] in the rehearsal scene between Tony and Annette in the dance studio, and choreographed their dance moves to the song. However, representatives for Scaggs' label [[Columbia Records]] refused to grant legal clearance for it, as they wanted to pursue another disco movie project, which never materialized. Composer [[David Shire]], who scored the film, had to in turn write a song to match the dance steps demonstrated in the scene and eliminate the need for future legal hassles. However, this track does not appear on the movie's soundtrack.\n\nThe song \"K-Jee\" was used during the dance contest with the Puerto Rican couple that competed against Tony and Stephanie. Some VHS cassettes used a more traditional Latin-style song instead. The DVD restores the original recording.\n\nThe album, like its parent film, has been added to the [[Library of Congress]] via the [[National Recording Registry]]. <ref>{{cite web|last=Richards |first=Chris |url=http://www.mercurynews.com/entertainment/ci_22840673/library-congress-adds-saturday-night-fever-simon-and |title=Library of Congress adds 'Saturday Night Fever,' Simon and Garfunkel, Pink Floyd to audio archive \u2013 San Jose Mercury News |website=Mercurynews.com |access-date=2013-06-06}}</ref>\n\n==Source material==\n[[Norman Wexler]]'s screenplay was adapted from a 1976 ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' magazine article by British writer [[Nik Cohn]], \"[[Tribal Rites of the New Saturday Night]]\".

Avildsen]] was originally hired as the film's director, but was replaced one month before principal photography by [[John Badham]] over \"conceptual disagreements.\"<ref name=\":0\" /> Badham was a lesser-known director who, like his star, had mostly worked in television. His sole prior film credit, ''[[The Bingo Long Traveling All-Stars & Motor Kings]]'', was released while ''Saturday Night Fever'' was already well into production.\n\nThe film went through several different titles, including ''Tribal Rites of the New Saturday Night'' and ''Saturday Night.'' Badham chose the final title after the Bee Gees' track \"[[Night Fever]]\", which they submitted for the soundtrack.\n\n==Production==\n===Casting===\nThe film's relatively low budget ($3.5 million) meant that most of the actors were relative unknowns, many of whom were recruited from New York's theatre scene. For more than 40% of the actors it was their film debut. The only actor in the cast who was already an established name was [[John Travolta]], thanks to his role on the sitcom ''[[Welcome Back, Kotter]]''. His performance as Tony Manero brought him critical acclaim and helped launch him into international stardom. Travolta researched the part by visiting the real 2001 Odyssey discotheque, and claimed he adopted many of the character's swaggering mannerisms from the male patrons. He insisted on performing his character's own dance sequences after producers suggested he be substituted by a [[body double]], rehearsing his choreography with [[Lester Wilson]] and [[Deney Terrio]] for three hours every day, losing 20 pounds in the process.\n\n[[Karen Lynn Gorney]] was nine years older than Travolta when she was cast as his love interest Stephanie. Although Gorney had dance experience before she was cast, she found it difficult to keep up with her co-star due to injuries sustained in a motorcycle accident some years before. After the success of ''Saturday Night Fever''<nowiki/>, Gorney took a hiatus from film acting to work as a dance instructor at a performing arts academy in [[Brooklyn]]. [[Jessica Lange]], [[Kathleen Quinlan]], [[Carrie Fisher]], and [[Amy Irving]] were all considered for the part before Gorney was cast.\n\n[[Donna Pescow]] was considered almost \"too pretty\" by Paramount heads [[Michael Eisner]] and [[Jeffrey Katzenberg]] for the role of Annette. She corrected this matter by putting on weight. She also had to relearn her native Brooklyn accent, which she had overcome while studying drama at the [[American Academy of Dramatic Arts]].<ref>{{Cite news|last=Gelder|first=BY Lawrence Van|date=1978-01-06|title=New race: Donna Pescow (Published 1978)|language=en-US|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1978/01/06/archives/new-race-donna-pescow-elocution-lessons-in-brooklynese-a-solution-a.html|access-date=2020-11-09|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>\n\n===Filming===\nThe film was shot entirely on-location in [[Brooklyn]], [[New York City|New York]]. The 2001 Odyssey Disco was a real club located at 802 64th Street, which has since been demolished. The interior was modified for the film, including the addition of a $15,000 lighted floor, which was inspired by a [[Birmingham, Alabama]] establishment Badham had visited. A similar effect was achieved on the club's walls using [[tinfoil]] and [[Christmas lights]]. Since the Bee Gees were not involved in the production until after principal photography wrapped, the \"Night Fever\", \"You Should Be Dancin'\", and \"More Than a Woman\" sequences were shot with [[Stevie Wonder]] tracks that were later overdubbed in the sound mix. During filming, the production was harassed by local gangs over use of the location, and was even firebombed.\n\nThe dance studio was Phillips Dance Studio in [[Bensonhurst, Brooklyn|Bensonhurst]], the Manero home was a house in [[Bay Ridge, Brooklyn|Bay Ridge]],<ref>{{Cite web|date=2012-12-14|title=Bay Ridge Still Has Saturday Night Fever, 35 Years Later|url=https://brooklynbased.com/2012/12/14/bay-ridge-still-has-saturday-night-fever-35-years-later/|access-date=2021-03-31|website=brooklynbased.com|language=en-US}}</ref> the paint store was Pearson Paint & Hardware, also in Bay Ridge. Other locations included the [[Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge]], [[John J. Carty Park]], and the [[Brooklyn Heights Promenade]].\n\nTo try to throw off Travolta's fans who might disrupt filming, Badham and his team took to shooting exterior scenes as early in the morning as possible before people caught on \u2013 often at the crack of dawn. They would also generate fake [[Daily call sheet|call sheets]]. The tactics worked well enough that Badham was usually able to get the scenes done before significant crowds had time to gather.\n\n==Release==\n===Theatrical===\n{{More citations needed section|date=December 2017}}\n[[File:Saturday night fever pg version movie poster.jpg|thumb|right|Movie poster of the PG version of ''Saturday Night Fever'']]\nTwo theatrical versions of the film were released: the original [[R rating (Motion Picture Association of America)|R-rated]] version and an edited [[PG-Rating|PG-rated]] version in 1979.<ref name=\"AFI\"/>\n\nThe R-rated version released in 1977 represented the movie's [[First run (film)|first run]], and totaled 119 minutes. After the success of the first run, the film's content was re-edited into a 112-minute, toned down, PG-rated version, not only to attract a wider audience, but also to capitalize on attracting the target audience of the teenagers who were not old enough to see the film by themselves, but who made the film's soundtrack album a monster hit. The R-rated version's profanity, nudity, fight sequence, and a multiple rape scene in a car, were all de-emphasized or removed from the PG version. Numerous profanity-filled scenes were replaced with alternate [[Take#Film|takes]] of the same scenes, substituting milder language initially intended for the network television cut.\n\nParamount planned to theatrically release the PG-rated version, which was being shown by airlines, in 1978; however, [[Motion Picture Association|MPAA]] rules at the time did not allow for two different rated versions of a film to be shown in U.S. theaters at the same time. This required the film to be withdrawn from exhibition for 90 days before a different rated version could be shown, delaying Paramount's release plans.<ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=May 31, 1978|last=Segers|first=Frank|page=3|title=Par Asks, Then Drops, Request MPAA Give Two Ratings Of Pic, With No 90-Day Withdrawal}}</ref> The PG-rated version was eventually released in 1979 and was later paired by Paramount in a [[double feature]] along with its other John Travolta blockbuster, ''[[Grease (film)|Grease]]''.<ref>{{cite news |title=Tower Ticker |last=Gold |first=Aaron |date=1979-03-27 |work=[[Chicago Tribune]] |pages=A7 }}</ref> In the [[A&E (TV network)|A&E]] documentary ''The Inside Story: Saturday Night Fever'', producer [[Robert Stigwood]] critiqued of the PG-rated version:\n{{quote|It ruined the film.

[[Fathom Events]] hosted special screenings of this version in 2017. \n\n===Home media===\n{{More citations needed section|date=December 2017}}\nBoth theatrical versions were released on [[VHS]]. The PG-rated version never had a [[home video]] release on [[Laserdisc]]. The R-rated special-edition [[DVD]] release includes most of the deleted scenes present on the PG version, as well as a director's commentary and \"Behind the Music\" featurettes. \n\nOn May 5, 2009, Paramount released ''Saturday Night Fever'' on [[Blu-ray|Blu-ray Disc]] in [[16:9 aspect ratio|1.78:1]] aspect ratio. This release retains the R-rated version of the film, in addition to including many special features new to home media.<ref>{{cite web|website=Blu-ray.com|last=Terrence|first=Sir|title=Saturday Night Fever Blu-ray Review|url=http://www.blu-ray.com/movies/Saturday-Night-Fever-Blu-ray/478/#Review|publisher=Blu-ray.com|access-date=November 25, 2013|date=May 8, 2009}}</ref>\n\nThe [[4K resolution|4K]] director's cut (122 minutes) was released on Blu-ray on May 2, 2017. This disc includes both the director's cut and the original theatrical version, as well as the bulk of the bonus features from the prior release.\n\n===Television broadcast===\nWhen [[HBO]] acquired the [[pay television]] rights to ''Saturday Night Fever'' in 1980, both versions of the film were aired by the network: the PG version during the day, and the R version during the evening. (HBO, which had primarily operated on a late afternoon-to-early overnight schedule at the time, had maintained a programming policy restricting the showing of R-rated films to the nighttime hours, a rule that continued long after it switched to a 24-hour schedule full-time in December 1981.) The R-rated theatrical version premiered on the network at midnight [[Eastern Time Zone|Eastern Time]] on January 1, 1980.\n\nFor the film's network television premiere, airing on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] on November 16, 1980, a new milder version was created to conform with network broadcast standards. The network television version\u2014which is among the longest cuts of the film\u2014was basically a slightly shortened cut of the PG-rated version, but to maintain runtime, a few additional scenes deleted from both theatrical releases were restored to make up for the lost/cut material (including Tony dancing with Doreen to \"[[Disco Duck]]\", Tony running his finger along the cables of the [[Verrazzano\u2013Narrows Bridge]], and Tony's father getting his job back). The last two deleted scenes were included in the 2017 director's cut.\n\nStarting in the late 1990s, [[VH1]], [[TBS (American TV channel)|TBS]] and [[TNT (American TV network)|TNT]] began showing the original R-rated version with a [[TV Parental Guidelines|TV-14 rating]], although with nudity removed/censored, and the stronger profanity either being edited or (on recent airings) silenced. However, this version of the TV cut included some innuendo included in the original theatrical release that was edited or removed from the PG version.
