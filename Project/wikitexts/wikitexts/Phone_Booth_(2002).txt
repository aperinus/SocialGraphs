In the film, a malevolent hidden [[sniper]] calls a [[phone booth]], and when a young publicist inside answers the phone, he quickly finds his life is at risk. The film received generally positive reviews from critics and was a box office hit, grossing $97 million worldwide against a production budget of $13 million.\n\nThe film was premiered at the [[2002 Toronto International Film Festival]], and was set to be theatrically released in November 2002, but the [[D.C. sniper attacks]] in October 2002 prompted [[20th Century Fox]] to delay the release of the film, and it opened in the United States on April 4, 2003.\n\n==Plot==\n\nStuart Shepard is an arrogant and dishonest New York City publicist who has been having an affair with Pamela McFadden behind the back of his wife Kelly. While in [[Times Square]], Stuart uses a public phone booth to contact Pam, allowing him to avoid detection by Kelly. During the call, he is interrupted by a pizza delivery man who attempts to deliver a free pizza to him, but Stuart aggressively turns him away. As soon as Stuart completes his call, the phone rings. Stuart answers; a man on the other end, who knows his name, warns him not to leave the booth, threatening to tell Kelly about Pam.\n\nThe caller tells Stuart that he has tested two previous individuals who have done wrong deeds in a similar manner, giving each a chance to reveal the truth to those they wronged, but in both cases they refused and were killed. Stuart must confess his feelings to both Kelly and Pam to avoid the same fate. To demonstrate the threat, the caller fires a suppressed sniper rifle with pinpoint accuracy. The caller then contacts Pam and connects her to Stuart, who admits that he is married.\n\nThe booth is approached by three sex workers demanding to use the phone, but Stuart refuses to leave, without revealing his dilemma. Leon, a pimp, breaks the glass side of the booth, grabs Stuart and pummels him while the sex workers cheer. The caller offers to \"make him stop\" and in Stuart's confusion, he inadvertently asks for this; the caller shoots Leon dead. The sex workers immediately blame Stuart, accusing him of having a gun, as the police and news crews converge on the location.\n\n[[New York City Police Department|NYPD]] Captain Ed Ramey seals off the area and negotiates to make Stuart leave the booth, but he refuses. Stuart tells the caller that there is no way they can incriminate him, but the caller draws his attention to a handgun planted in the roof of the phone booth. As Kelly and Pam both arrive on the scene, the caller demands that Stuart tell Kelly the truth, which he does. The caller then orders Stuart to choose between Kelly and Pam, and the woman he does not choose will be shot.\n\nStuart secretly uses his cell phone to call Kelly, allowing her to overhear his conversation with the caller; she quietly informs Ramey of this. Meanwhile, Stuart continues to confess to everyone that his whole life is a lie, to make himself look better than he really is. Stuart's confession provides sufficient distraction to allow the police to trace the payphone call to a nearby building. Stuart warns the caller that the police are on the way, and the caller replies that if he is caught, he will kill Kelly. Desperate, Stuart grabs the handgun and leaves the booth, begging for the sniper to kill him instead. The police fire upon Stuart, while a [[SWAT]] team breaks into the room that the caller was tracked to, only to find a rifle and a man's corpse.\n\nStuart regains consciousness; the police fired only [[rubber bullet]]s, stunning but not harming him. Stuart and Kelly happily reconcile. As the police bring down the body, Stuart identifies it as the pizza delivery man from earlier. Stuart gets medical treatment at a local ambulance; as he does, the real caller passes by, warning Stuart that if his newfound honesty does not last, he will return, before disappearing into the crowd. Later, the pay phone rings and another man answers.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Colin Farrell]] as Stuart \"Stu\" Shepard, a selfish and dishonest publicist who becomes a victim of a mysterious caller who threatens to kill him\n* [[Kiefer Sutherland]] as The Caller, an unnamed, malevolent, but scheming killer and trained [[sniper]], who calls Stu in the phone booth, and starts to threaten his life\n* [[Forest Whitaker]] as Captain Ed Ramey, a police captain who gives assistance to Stu in his conflict against The Caller, but suspects him as the killer\n* [[Katie Holmes]] as Pamela  \"Pam\" McFadden, Stu's girlfriend\n* [[Radha Mitchell]] as Kelly Shepard, Stu's wife\n* [[Paula Jai Parker]] as Felicia\n* [[Tia Texada]] as Asia\n* [[John Enos III]] as Leon\n* [[Richard T.

Hitchcock liked the idea, but the project did not move forward, because the two men were unable to devise a plot which explained why the action had to be restricted to the one location.<ref name = Cohen>{{Cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2003-mar-30-ca-cohen30-story.html|title='Phone Booth': A 30-year project wouldn't hang up|last=Cohen|first=Larry|date=March 30, 2003|website=Los Angeles Times|access-date=December 3, 2019}}</ref> Cohen recalled that Hitchcock would ask him if he had a solution to the problem when they periodically met over the following years, but was not until the late 1990s, some two decades after Hitchcock's death, when he came up with the answer of a sniper forcing the protagonist to remain within the phone booth, and was able to write a script.<ref name = Cohen />\n\n[[Creative Artists Agency]] signed a contract with Cohen and the script appealed to several [[A-list]] actors, such as [[Tom Cruise]], [[Will Smith]], [[Mel Gibson]], [[Robin Williams]], [[Anthony Hopkins]], and [[Nicolas Cage]]; directors placed in contention included Gibson, [[Steven Spielberg]], the [[Hughes brothers]], and Michael Bay; according to Cohen, Bay was removed from consideration after the first question he asked about the script was, \"OK, how do we get this thing out of the damn telephone booth?\"<ref name = Cohen /> Eventually, [[Joel Schumacher]], who had been considered early in development, was brought back on to direct the film. [[Jim Carrey]] was originally cast as Stu Shepard, but he dropped out. Schumacher said: \"We were going to shoot it that summer and he was fitted for the suit. But I got a call from Jim one night and told me he had cold feet. He really didn't feel comfortable with it. Actors never give up their role. If an actor gives up a part then it's not right for them.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Evans|first=Bradford|title=The Lost Roles of Jim Carrey|date=March 17, 2011|publisher=Vulture.com|website=[[Splitsider]]|url=http://splitsider.com/2011/03/the-lost-roles-of-jim-carrey/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180603084824/http://www.vulture.com/2011/03/the-lost-roles-of-jim-carrey.html|archive-date=June 3, 2018|access-date=August 10, 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===Filming===\n{{more citations needed|section|date = April 2022}}\nThe principal photography on the film was completed in ten days, with an additional two days of establishing shots, pickups, and re-shoots. This accelerated filming schedule was aided by the adoption of [[French hours]], a work schedule that skips the typical one-hour production shutdown for lunch break, in exchange for making food available all throughout the shooting day.<ref>{{cite news |title=French Hours |first=Seth |last=Godin |author-link=Seth Godin |newspaper=[[Fast Company (magazine)|Fast Company]] |date=August 1, 2004 |url=http://www.fastcompany.com/magazine/85/sgodin.html |access-date=May 3, 2010}}</ref>\n\nThis was costume designer Daniel Orlandi's second feature with Joel Schumacher, having previously worked together on ''[[Flawless (1999 film)|Flawless]]''. According to him, [[Dolce & Gabbana]] created the suit and shirt worn by Colin Farrell. Though the fashion house was tasked with making additional suit copies for filming, they unfortunately would not arrive until the last day of shooting. Thankfully, the film was shot chronologically and thus the costume could sustain damage without slowing down production. Orlandi was able to keep one of the suit copies for himself as he and Farrell were the same size.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Brooker |first1=Pete |title=Costume Designer Daniel Orlandi talks Phone Booth |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwSfc8S-_40  |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211221/SwSfc8S-_40 |archive-date=2021-12-21 |url-status=live|website=From Tailors With Love |publisher=YouTube |access-date=27 November 2020}}{{cbignore}}</ref>\n\nThe film is set in [[Real-time (media)|real time]], so the timespan in which the film takes place is as long as it takes to watch it, much like the television series ''[[24 (TV series)|24]]'', which also stars [[Kiefer Sutherland]]. Like ''24'', it also uses [[split screen (film)|split screens]]. Although the film is set in New York City, it was filmed in front of what is now the CB1 Gallery in downtown Los Angeles, in November 2000.
