His girlfriend, Janine ([[Wendy Moniz]]), a backup singer feels that he never places her as a priority. Mitch is consistently doing six things at once. One evening, while on the telephone with Janine, Mitch flips through TV channels and lands on an edition of ''[[Nightline]]'' where he sees his former professor [[Morrie Schwartz]] ([[Jack Lemmon]]) being interviewed by [[Ted Koppel]]. Morrie discusses his current health and lets everyone know he is dying of [[Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis]], often referred to as \"[[Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis|Lou Gehrig's disease]]\" or [[ALS]]. Morrie, a retired [[sociology]] professor from [[Brandeis University]], comes on the show to describe his final journey.\n\nAs life goes on with work and balancing his relationship with Janine, Mitch feels bothered he never got a chance to visit his old professor. Feeling so moved by the interview, Mitch reaches out for a visit with Morrie after sixteen years of no contact. Morrie has an affinity with food and it becomes a regular endeavor with his visits with Mitch. Office hours during university were on Tuesdays, Morrie would grade papers and critique student\u2019s assignments, Mitch now makes it a habit to visit him every Tuesday. Connie ([[Caroline Aaron]]), Morrie\u2019s home nurse, is his primary care taker. After leaving Morrie, Mitch continues working and can\u2019t find a groove with Janine.\n\nMitch returns and witnesses a \u201cliving funeral\u201d where friends and family come to honor Morrie while he is still alive, per Morrie\u2019s request. As the two get reacquainted, they participate in several thoughtful and reflective conversations about various substantial topics. Morrie divulges in many stories on his time as a young boy and how his relationships unfolded between his mother, stepmother, and father. Back home Mitch continues with his impressive and busy [[journalism]] career, and while out on a story he receives a call from Janine breaking up with him.\n\nAnother visit prompts Mitch to officially bring a recording device to capture all of Morrie\u2019s powerful pieces of advice and all his anecdotes. Morrie and Mitch grow closer and closer with each visit, some significant topics that were explored were death, love, marriage, family, and relationships. The time spent with Morrie starts to affect Mitch\u2019s position at work, he argues with his boss and decides to prioritize his visits with Morrie. Mitch, being so immersed in this new world asks Connie to teach him a few skills to aid Morrie when no one else is around. New tasks Mitch learns include: helping Morrie in and out of his [[wheelchair]], using his oxygen tank, feeding Morrie, and even special [[massage]]s.\n\nFinding value and meaning in Morrie\u2019s advice, Mitch proposes to Janine via letter. She rejects him and comes along on one of his visits to Morrie\u2019s home. Janine notices a change in Mitch\u2019s personality in the way he knows what to do around Morrie from the oxygen tank assistance to cleaning Morrie\u2019s crying eyes. Janine and Morrie speak without Mitch in the room. Later, on an airplane on their way home Mitch and Janine make up and decide a proper proposal should take place.\n\nOn a rainy visit, Mitch brings Morrie food, but learns he has not been able to eat solid foods for some time. Charlotte ([[Bonnie Bartlett]]), Morrie\u2019s wife advises Mitch that his visits have a great impact on Morrie. Mitch notices how the illness is progressing in a devastating way. They continue to go back and forth on difficult topics, regret, spiritual life, forgiveness, and love. Morrie reiterates that we all, as humans, must love one another or die. He recounts the story of his father\u2019s death. Mitch receives a call from Walter ([[John Carroll Lynch]]), his boss, and they find middle ground to allow Mitch to write again. Mitch takes Janine to the islands and proposes to her there. Once back home, Mitch requests to have all of his Tuesdays off to continue his visits with Morrie.\n\nOn a snowy visit, Mitch asks Morrie what a perfect day would be like. Morrie gives a simple answer with friends, family, food, dancing, and choosing his burial site. Morrie asks Mitch to visit once he has passed, breaking his heart. Mitch cries and hugs his old friend. Mitch promises to come back next [[Tuesday]]. Morrie dies Saturday morning, Janine and Mitch receive a call. Charlotte keeps his [[funeral]] small, and all the people in his perfect day are included. The funeral is held on a Tuesday.<ref>{{Citation|last=luispucela84|title=Tuesdays with Morrie (TV 1999)|date=2013-05-19|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E463tZdAGn4 |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211215/E463tZdAGn4 |archive-date=2021-12-15 |url-status=live|access-date=2019-04-26}}{{cbignore}}</ref>\n\n==Cast and characters==\n* [[Jack Lemmon]] \u2013 [[Morrie Schwartz]]\n* [[Hank Azaria]] \u2013 [[Mitch Albom]]\n* [[Wendy Moniz]] \u2013 Janine, Mitch's girlfriend\n* [[Caroline Aaron]] \u2013 Connie, Morrie's home nurse\n* [[Bonnie Bartlett]] \u2013 Charlotte Schwartz, Morrie's wife\n* [[Aaron Lustig]] \u2013 Rabbi Al Axelrod\n* Bruce Nozick \u2013 Mr. Schwartz\n* Ivo Cutzarida \u2013 Armand\n* [[John Carroll Lynch]] \u2013 Walter Moran, Mitch's boss from the sports column\n* [[Kyle Sullivan]] \u2013 Young Morrie\n* Dan Thiel \u2013 Shawn Daley\n* [[Christian Meoli]] \u2013 Aldo\n* [[John Billingsley]] \u2013 Sports Fan #1\n\n==Reception==\nThe review aggregator [[Rotten Tomatoes]] give it a 71% rating based on 7 reviews.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Tuesdays With Morrie (1999) |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/tuesdays_with_morrie |work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |access-date=2022-04-01 }}</ref> Fred Topel from About.com says, \"Movie of the week with film caliber performances\".<ref>{{Citation|title=Tuesdays With Morrie (1999)|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/tuesdays_with_morrie|language=en|access-date=2019-04-26}}</ref> Common Sense Media Editors states, \"Oprah Winfrey presents a three-hanky weepfest\".<ref>{{cite web |title=Tuesdays with Morrie Movie Review {{!}} Common Sense Media |url=http://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/tuesdays-with-morrie |website=[[Common Sense Media]] }}</ref>\n\n===Ratings===\nThe film brought in a 15.2/22 rating/share, and was watched by 22.5 million viewers, ranking as the most watched program that week.<ref>http://americanradiohistory.com/Archive-BC/BC-1999/BC-1999-12-13.pdf {{Bare URL PDF|date=March 2022}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/WPcap/1999-12/08/075r-120899-idx.html| title = Rudolph Sleighs 'em in the Ratings| newspaper = [[The Washington Post]]}}</ref>\n\n===Awards and nominations===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n!
