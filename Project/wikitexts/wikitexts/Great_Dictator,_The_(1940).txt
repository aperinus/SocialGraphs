Having been the only [[Hollywood (film industry)|Hollywood]] filmmaker to continue to make [[silent film]]s well into the period of [[sound film]]s, Chaplin made this his first true sound film.\n\nChaplin's film advanced a stirring condemnation of [[Adolf Hitler]], [[Benito Mussolini]], [[fascism]], [[antisemitism]], and the [[Nazism|Nazis]]. At the time of its first release, the United States was still formally at peace with [[Nazi Germany]] and neutral during what were the early days of World War II. Chaplin plays both leading roles: a ruthless fascist dictator and a persecuted Jewish barber.\n\n''The Great Dictator'' was popular with audiences, becoming Chaplin's most commercially successful film.<ref name=\"trampdict\"/> Modern critics have  praised it as a historically significant film, one of the greatest comedy films ever made and an important work of [[satire (film and television)|satire]]. Chaplin's climactic monologue has frequently been listed by critics, historians and film buffs as perhaps the greatest monologue in film history, and possibly the most poignant recorded speech of the 20th century.{{Citation needed|date=July 2021}} In 1997, it was selected by the [[Library of Congress]] for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".<ref name=\":0\"/><ref>{{Cite web|title=New to the National Film Registry (December 1997) \u2013 Library of Congress Information Bulletin|url=https://www.loc.gov/loc/lcib/9712/nfr.html|access-date=2020-06-23|website=www.loc.gov}}</ref> ''The Great Dictator'' was nominated for five [[Academy Awards]]&nbsp;\u2013 [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Outstanding Production]], [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]], [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay|Best Writing (Original Screenplay)]], [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Supporting Actor]] for [[Jack Oakie]], and [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Best Music (Original Score)]].\n\nIn his 1964 autobiography, Chaplin stated that he could not have made the film if he had known about the true extent of the horrors of the [[Nazi concentration camps]] at that time.<ref name=\"ChaplinLager\">{{cite book |last=Chaplin|first=Charlie|author-link=Charlie Chaplin|date=1964|title=My Autobiography|url=https://archive.org/details/myautobiography00chaprich|url-access=registration|page=[https://archive.org/details/myautobiography00chaprich/page/392 392]|publisher=New York, Simon and Schuster|quote=Had I known of the actual horrors of the German concentration camps, I could not have made ''The Great Dictator'', I could not have made fun of the homicidal insanity of the Nazis}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n\nOn the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] in 1918, a Jewish Private ([[Charlie Chaplin]]) fighting for the [[Central Powers]] nation of [[German Empire|Tomainia]]<ref>The spelling of the country's name is derived from the numerous local newspapers flashed onscreen between 14 and 15 minutes into the film that indicate the end of World War I, such as ''The Tomainian past'', thus establishing the proper spelling.</ref> valiantly saves the life of a wounded pilot, Commander Schultz ([[Reginald Gardiner]]), who carries valuable documents that could secure a Tomainian victory. However, after running out of fuel, their plane crashes into a tree and the Private subsequently suffers memory loss. Upon being rescued, Schultz is informed that Tomainia has officially surrendered to the [[Allies of World War I|Allied Forces]], while the Private is carried off to a hospital.\n\n[[File:Dictator charlie2.jpg|thumb|left|Chaplin as Adenoid Hynkel]]\nTwenty years later, still suffering from amnesia, the Private returns to his previous profession as a [[barber]] in a [[Jewish ghettos in Europe|ghetto]]. The ghetto is now governed by Schultz who has been promoted in the Tomainian regime, which transformed into a [[Nazi Germany|fascist dictatorship]] under the ruthless [[Adolf Hitler|Adenoid Hynkel]] (also Chaplin).\n\nThe Barber falls in love with a neighbor, Hannah ([[Paulette Goddard]]), and together they try to resist persecution by military forces. The [[Schutzstaffel|storm troopers]] capture the Barber and are about to hang him, but Schultz recognizes him and restrains them. By recognizing him, and reminding him of [[World War I]], Schultz helps the Barber regain his memory.\n\nMeanwhile, Hynkel tries to finance his ever-growing military forces by borrowing money from a Jewish banker called Hermann Epstein, leading to a temporary ease on the restrictions on the ghetto. However, ultimately the banker refuses to lend him the money. Furious, Hynkel orders a purge of the Jews. Schultz protests against this inhumane policy and is sent to a [[Nazi concentration camps|concentration camp]]. He escapes and hides in the ghetto with the Barber. Schultz tries to persuade the Jewish family to assassinate Hynkel in a [[suicide attack]], but they are dissuaded by Hannah. Troops search the ghetto, arrest Schultz and the Barber, and send both to a concentration camp. Hannah and her family flee to freedom at a vineyard in the neighboring country of [[Austria|Osterlich]].\n\nHynkel has a dispute with the dictator of the nation of [[Fascist Italy (1922\u20131943)|Bacteria]], [[Benito Mussolini|Benzino Napaloni]] ([[Jack Oakie]]), over which country should [[Anschluss|invade]] Osterlich. The two dictators argue over a treaty to govern the invasion, while dining together at an elaborate buffet, which happens to provide a jar of [[English mustard]]. The quarrel becomes heated and descends into a food fight, which is only resolved when both men eat the hot mustard and are shocked into cooperating. After signing the treaty with Napaloni, Hynkel orders the invasion of Osterlich. Hannah and her family are trapped by the invading force and beaten by a squad of arriving soldiers.\n\n[[File:Dictator charlie6.jpg|thumb|right|Chaplin as Adenoid Hynkel (right) with [[Jack Oakie]] as Benzino Napaloni (left).]]\nEscaping from the camp in stolen uniforms, Schultz and the Barber, dressed as Hynkel, arrive at the [[Austria|Osterlich]] frontier, where a victory parade crowd is waiting to be addressed by Hynkel. The real Hynkel is mistaken for the Barber while out [[Waterfowl hunting|duck hunting]] in civilian clothes and is knocked out and taken to the camp. Schultz tells the Barber to go to the platform and impersonate Hynkel, as the only way to save their lives once they reach Osterlich's capital. The Barber has never given a public speech in his life, but he has no other choice. He announces that he (as Hynkel) has had a change of heart, he makes an impassioned speech for brotherhood and goodwill, encouraging soldiers to fight for liberty, and unite the people in the name of [[democracy]].\n\nHe then addresses a message of hope to Hannah: \"Look up, Hannah. The soul of man has been given wings, and at last he is beginning to fly. He is flying into the rainbow, into the light of hope, into the future, the glorious future that belongs to you, to me, and to all of us.\" Hannah hears the Barber's voice on the radio.

[[Nazi Germany]]'s repressive nature and [[militarist]] tendencies were well known at the time. [[Ernst Lubitsch]]'s 1942 ''[[To Be or Not to Be (1942 film)|To Be or Not To Be]]'' dealt with similar themes, and also used a mistaken-identity Hitler figure.

He was mobbed by fans on a 1931 trip to Berlin, which annoyed the Nazis. Resenting his style of comedy, they published a book titled ''The Jews Are Looking at You'' (1934), describing the comedian as \"a disgusting Jewish acrobat\" (although Chaplin was not Jewish). [[Ivor Montagu]], a close friend of Chaplin's, relates that he sent the comedian a copy of the book and always believed that Chaplin decided to retaliate with making ''Dictator''.<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Stratton |first=David |date=February 21, 2002 |url=https://variety.com/2002/film/reviews/the-tramp-and-the-dictator-1200551216/ |title=The Tramp and the Dictator |magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |access-date=December 28, 2020 }}</ref>\n\nIn the 1930s, cartoonists and comedians often built on Hitler and Chaplin having similar mustaches.

He wrote:\n\n<blockquote>\nTheir destinies were poles apart. One was to make millions weep, while the other was to set the whole world laughing.

Willson's task was to re-record it with the full studio orchestra, fitting the music to the action. They had planned to do it painstakingly, recording eight measures or less at a time, after running through the whole scene to get the overall idea.

How can the master's music simultaneously signify a desire for lost emotional integrity and for authoritative grandeur?\n\nChaplin's dual use of ''Lohengrin'' points towards unsettling conjunctions of Nazi culture and Hollywood entertainment. Like [[Adorno]], Chaplin understands Wagner as a signifier of both: the birth of [[fascism]] out of the spirit of the total work of art and the origin of mass culture out of the spirit of the most arduous aesthetic program of the 19th century. Unlike Adorno [who identifies American mass culture and fascist spectacle], Chaplin wants his audience to make crucial distinctions between competing Wagnerianisms. Both...rely on the driving force of utopian desires, on...the promise of self-transcendence and authentic collectivity, but they channel these mythic longings in fundamentally different directions. Although [Chaplin] exposes the puzzling modernity of Nazi politics, Chaplin is unwilling to write off either Wagner or industrial culture. [Chaplin suggests] Hollywood needs Wagner as never before in order to at once condemn the use of fantasy in fascism and warrant the utopian possibilities in industrial culture.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Dark Mirror: German Cinema between Hitler and Hollywood |url=https://archive.org/details/darkmirrorgerman00koep |url-access=limited |last=Koepnick |first=Lutz Peter |year=2002 |publisher=University of California Press |isbn= 978-0-520-23311-9 |page=[https://archive.org/details/darkmirrorgerman00koep/page/n153 141] }}</ref>}}\n\n==Reception==\n[[File:Buenos Aires - Publicidad ambulante en 1941.jpg|thumb|Billboard bicycle of the movie with its title in Spanish, ''El gran dictador'', in [[Buenos Aires]], 1941.]]\nChaplin's film was released nine months after Hollywood's first parody of Hitler, the short subject ''[[You Nazty Spy!]]'' by the [[Three Stooges]], which premiered in January 1940.<ref>{{cite book |title=Fighting the War of Ideas Like a Real War |last=Waller |first=J.

However, in the majority of his so-called tramp films, he was not literally playing a tramp. In his review of the film years after its release, [[Roger Ebert]] says, \"Chaplin was technically not playing the Tramp.\" He also writes, \"He [Chaplin] put the Little Tramp and $1.5 million of his own money on the line to ridicule Hitler.\"<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/great-movie-the-great-dictator-1940 |title=The Great Dictator (1940) [review] |first=Roger |last=Ebert |date=September 27, 2007 |newspaper= Chicago Sun-Times |access-date=December 31, 2010}}</ref>\n\nCritics who view the barber as different include Stephen Weissman, whose book ''Chaplin: A Life'' speaks of Chaplin \"abandoning traditional pantomime technique and his little tramp character\".<ref>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/chaplinlife0000weis|title=Chaplin: A Life|author=Weissman, Stephen|year=2008|publisher=Arcade|isbn=978-1-55970-892-0|url-access=registration}}</ref> DVD reviewer Mark Bourne asserts Chaplin's stated position: \"Granted, the barber bears more than a passing resemblance to the Tramp, even affecting the familiar bowler hat and cane.

The similar nature of the Tramp and Barber characterizations may have been an effort by Chaplin to maintain his popularity with filmgoers, many of whom by 1940 had never seen a [[silent film|silent picture]] during the silent era.
