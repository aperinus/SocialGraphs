Thatcher]] featuring [[The Muppets]] in a Christmas mission to personally deliver three letters to [[Santa Claus]], accidentally diverted by [[Gonzo (Muppet)|Gonzo]], to the North Pole. The special, shot in [[Brooklyn]] and [[Midtown Manhattan]], was released by [[Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment]] on DVD.<ref>[https://www.amazon.com/Muppets-Christmas-Letters-Steve-Whitmire/dp/B002DLB15W Amazon.com: Muppets Christmas: Letters to Santa: Steve Whitmire, Dave Goelz, Bill Barretta, Eric Jacobson, Mayor Michael Bloomberg, Whoopi Goldberg, Richard Griffiths, Jane Kr...<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nOn [[Christmas Eve]] in [[New York City]], the Muppets go to the post office to deliver each of their letters to [[Santa Claus]] with [[Mayor]] [[Michael Bloomberg]] denying [[Miss Piggy]]'s offer to move the line along as people in New York should be polite. The Muppets deliver their letters as [[Gonzo (Muppet)|Gonzo]] accidentally speeds up the letter conveyor belt as a postal worker ([[Jesse L. Martin]]) has the Muppets delivered back to their apartment building.\n\nWhen they head back to their apartment, Gonzo discovers that three letters wound up in his coat from a mishap there. One of those letters he recognizes as being written by his friend, a neighbor girl named Claire ([[Madison Pettis]]). With the post office closed early and [[Sam Eagle]] warning Gonzo and [[Fozzie Bear]] about the pitfalls of opening someone else's mail, the Muppets try different attempts like a pigeon delivery service and the enlistment of two Mafia members ([[Steve Schirripa]] and [[Tony Sirico]]). On Gonzo's insistence, the principal Muppets decide to go to the [[North Pole]] and deliver them personally. They get their in a taxi while scavenging money to pay the taxi cab driver ([[Whoopi Goldberg]])\n\nThe Muppets end up getting tickets from a North Pole Airlines [[clerk]] named Joy ([[Uma Thurman]]) and getting caught by a bitter [[security guard]] Officer Frank Meany ([[Nathan Lane]]) who, for being a bully in his youth, perpetually ended up on Santa's naughty list. It's also because of his appearance that people often fear him. He and [[List of Muppets#Bobo the Bear|Bobo the Bear]] allow the Muppets to pass through.\n\nThey eventually reach the North Pole, only to find out from the Chief [[Christmas elf|Christmas Elf]] ([[Paul Williams (songwriter)|Paul Williams]]) that Santa has already left to deliver the presents. The real Santa ([[Richard Griffiths]]) overhears their grieving and returns.\n\nWhile on a sleigh ride after being helped by Joy, they hand him Claire's letter and the other two which are revealed to have come from Pepe the King Prawn and Frank Meany. Pepe wanted to become an expert opera singer which Santa grants. Frank wanted to be taken off the naughty list. Santa grants this wish enabling Frank to finally get that red tricycle he wanted.\n\nSanta brings them home to New York in time to spend the rest of the holiday with Claire and her mom ([[Jane Krakowski]]), which was all Claire wanted in the first place. All the Muppets show up after cancelling their vacations where they celebrate Christmas with Claire and her mom as they decorate her apartment.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Madison Pettis]] - Claire\n* [[Jane Krakowski]] - Claire's Mom\n* [[Richard Griffiths]] - [[Santa Claus]]\n* [[Nathan Lane]] - Officer Frank Meany\n* [[Uma Thurman]] - Joy\n\n===Muppet performers===\n{{main|List of Muppets}}\n* [[Steve Whitmire]] - [[Kermit the Frog]], [[Rizzo the Rat]] (most scenes), [[Beaker (Muppet)|Beaker]], [[Statler and Waldorf|Statler]]\n* [[Dave Goelz]] - [[Gonzo (Muppet)|Gonzo the Great]], [[Bunsen Honeydew|Dr. Bunsen Honeydew]], [[Dr. Teeth and the Electric Mayhem#Zoot|Zoot]], [[Statler and Waldorf|Waldorf]], [[List of Muppets#Beauregard|Beauregard]]\n* [[Bill Barretta]] - [[Pepe the King Prawn]], [[List of Muppets#Bobo the Bear|Bobo the Bear]], [[Rowlf the Dog]], [[Swedish Chef]], [[Dr. Teeth and the Electric Mayhem#Dr. Teeth|Dr. Teeth]], Pigeon Dad\n* [[Eric Jacobson]] - [[Fozzie Bear]], [[Miss Piggy]], [[Animal (Muppet)|Animal]], [[Sam Eagle|Sam the Eagle]]\n* [[David Rudman]] - [[Scooter (Muppet)|Scooter]], [[Dr. Teeth and the Electric Mayhem#Janice|Janice]] \n* [[Matt Vogel (puppeteer)|Matt Vogel]]  - [[Dr. Teeth and the Electric Mayhem#Floyd Pepper|Floyd Pepper]], [[List of Muppets#Camilla the Chicken|Camilla the Chicken]], [[List of Muppets#Lew Zealand|Lew Zealand]], [[List of Muppets#Crazy Harry|Crazy Harry]], [[List of Muppets#Robin the Frog|Robin the Frog]], Pigeon Son\n* [[Noel MacNeal]] - [[List of Muppets#Sweetums|Sweetums]]\n* [[Tyler Bunch]] - Pigeon Mom, Rizzo the Rat (one scene)\n* [[Leslie Carrara-Rudolph]] - Penguin\n* [[Martin P.
