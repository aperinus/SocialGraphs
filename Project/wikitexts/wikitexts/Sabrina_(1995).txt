It is a remake of the 1954 [[Billy Wilder]] film [[Sabrina (1954 film)|of the same name]], which in turn was based upon the 1953 play ''[[Sabrina Fair]]''.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Sabrina {{!}} film by Pollack [1995] {{!}} Britannica |url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Sabrina-film-by-Pollack |access-date=2022-04-08 |website=www.britannica.com |language=en}}</ref>\n\nThe film stars [[Harrison Ford]] as Linus Larrabee, [[Julia Ormond]] as Sabrina and [[Greg Kinnear]] (in his first starring film role) as David Larrabee. It also features [[Angie Dickinson]], [[Richard Crenna]], [[Nancy Marchand]], [[Lauren Holly]], [[John Wood (English actor)|John Wood]], [[Dana Ivey]], and French actress [[Fanny Ardant]].\n\n''Sabrina'' was released on December 15, 1995, by [[Paramount Pictures]]. The film was a [[box office disappointment]], but earned mostly positive reviews from critics.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Before editing this section, see WP:FILMPLOT. The word count should be 400-700 words. -->\nSabrina Fairchild is the young daughter of the Larrabee family's chauffeur, Thomas, and has been in love with David Larrabee all her life. David is a playboy, constantly falling in love, yet he has never noticed Sabrina, much to her dismay.\n\nSabrina travels to Paris for a fashion internship at ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'' and returns to the Larrabee estate as an attractive, sophisticated woman. David, after initially not recognizing her, is quickly drawn to her despite being newly engaged to Elizabeth Tyson, a doctor and billionaire.\n\nDavid's workaholic older brother Linus fears that David's imminent wedding to the very suitable Elizabeth might be endangered. If the wedding were to be canceled, so would a lucrative merger with the bride's family business, Tyson Electronics, run by her father Patrick. This could cost the Larrabee Corporation, run by Linus and his mother Maude, over a billion dollars.\n\nAfter Linus manipulates David into sitting on champagne glasses in his back pocket, resulting in injuries that require David to be on painkillers, Linus redirects Sabrina's affections to himself in order to keep David's wedding on track. Sabrina falls in love with Linus, even though she quotes others as calling him \"the world's only living heart donor\" and someone who \"thinks that morals are paintings on walls and scruples are money in Russia.\"\n\nIn the process, Linus, surprising himself, also falls in love with Sabrina. Unwilling to admit his feelings, Linus confesses his scheme to Sabrina at the last minute and sends her back to Paris. Before she gets on the plane to Paris, her father informs her that over the years of chauffeuring the father of David and Linus, the partition was always open in the car and he was able to listen to Larrabee senior's business dealings. When Mr. Larrabee sold stock, the chauffeur would also sell and when Mr. Larrabee bought, the chauffeur would also buy. He then reveals that this has allowed him to amass a personal wealth of over $2 million although he continued to work as a chauffeur since he had a happy home and situation for the family. He is now able to give Sabrina the life he and her mother dreamed for her.\n\nMeanwhile, Linus realizes his true feelings for Sabrina, and is induced to follow her to Paris by chiding from his mother and an unexpectedly adult and responsible David, who steps into his shoes at the Larrabee Corporation with detailed plans for the merger with Tyson. Linus arrives in Paris and reunites with Sabrina, revealing his love to her and kissing her.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Harrison Ford]] as Linus Larrabee\n* [[Julia Ormond]] as Sabrina Fairchild\n* [[Greg Kinnear]] as David Larrabee\n* [[Angie Dickinson]] as Ingrid Tyson\n* [[Richard Crenna]] as Patrick Tyson\n* [[Nancy Marchand]] as Maude Larrabee\n* [[Lauren Holly]] as Elizabeth Tyson\n* [[John Wood (English actor)|John Wood]] as Thomas Fairchild\n* [[Dana Ivey]] as Mack\n* [[Fanny Ardant]] as Irene\n* [[Val\u00e9rie Lemercier]] as Martine\n* [[Paul Giamatti]] as Scott\n* [[Elizabeth Franz]] as Joanna \n* [[M\u00edriam Col\u00f3n]] as Rosa \n* [[Patrick Bruel]] as Louis \n* [[Becky Ann Baker]] as Linda\n* [[Margo Martindale]] as Nurse\n}}\n\n==Production==\nThe music was composed by [[John Williams]] and includes a song performed by [[Sting (musician)|Sting]]; both were nominated for [[Academy Awards]].\n\nIn contrast to the 1954 film the modern version was filmed in more authentic locations. While the original used Hollywood sound stages for all its Paris scenes with the actors, except for a few stock shots, this remake made extensive ''[[in situ]]'' use of outdoor locations in Paris and the final scene in the film is of the reunited lovers on the iconic [[Pont des Arts]]. Likewise, the earlier movie used a Beverly Hills mansion to substitute for the Long Island estate but in the 1995 movie the location used to portray the Larrabee family's mansion was the 'Salutation' estate, which is on Long Island in [[Glen Cove, New York]].<ref name=\"betweennapsontheporch.net\">{{cite web|url=http://betweennapsontheporch.net/sabrina-tour-the-beautiful-glen-cove-estate-in-the-movie/|title=Sabrina: Beautiful Glen Cove|date=23 April 2013}}</ref> This home was built around 1929 for [[Junius Spencer Morgan III]], who was a director of the [[Morgan Guaranty Trust Company]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.movie-locations.com/movies/s/sabrina95.html#.UyR6HGdOU5s|title=Filming Locations for Sydney Pollack's 1995 remake of Sabrina, in New York, Massachusetts and Paris.|first=Tony|last=Reeves}}</ref> His father was [[J.
