The film was an account of the complex realities of the situation in Iraq during 2003\u20132004 amidst the [[Iraqi insurgency (Iraq War)|Iraqi insurgency]] not seen on the nightly news. Told first-hand by [[United States Army|American troops]] stationed in the middle of Baghdad, ''Gunner Palace'' presents a portrait of a dangerous and chaotic war.\n\n==Synopsis==\nThe film documents the operations of 2nd Battalion, 3rd Field Artillery Regiment, an element of the 1st Brigade Combat Team, [[1st Armored Division (United States)|1st Armored Division]] beginning in the late summer of 2003 until the unit was relieved by [[3rd Battalion, 153rd Infantry Regiment]], of the [[39th Brigade Combat Team]], an element of the [[1st Cavalry Division (United States)|1st Cavalry Division]] in April 2004.  The soldiers were stationed in the [[Adhamiyah]] neighborhood of Baghdad which lies between the Tigris river on the west and Sadr City on the east. The unit's Forward Operating Base was at a former Presidential Palace, known as Adhamiyah Palace.\n\n===Adhamiyah Palace, a.k.a. Fort Apache, a.k.a. JSS Apache===\nAdhamiyah Palace, which is the backdrop for the documentary, was the scene of the last major firefight during the fall of Baghdad.<ref>the Washington Times, U.S. poised to let Iraqis take lead, By Richard Tomkins, Retrieved 4 Feb 2010,  http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2009/jun/29/us-poised-to-let-iraqis-take-lead/</ref>  The palace, which was known as Gunner Palace during its occupation by 2-3rd FA was eventually handed over to the Iraqi Army, except for three buildings which were retained by the following on the unit, Company C, 3-153rd IN and were renamed Patrol Base Apache. The patrol base was closed and the palace was completely handed over to the Iraqi Army in 2005. The Palace was reoccupied during the \"Surge\" of 2006-2007 and was then known as Joint Security Station Apache. SPC [[Ross McGinnis]], assigned to C Company, 1st Battalion, 26th Infantry Regiment, 2nd Brigade, [[1st Infantry Division (United States)|1st Infantry Division]], stationed at JSS Apache was awarded the [[Medal of Honor]] for his actions in the Adhamiyah neighborhood when he threw himself on a grenade in order to protect his fellow soldiers.<ref>http://www.ARMY.MIL, The Official Homepage of the United States Army, Medal of Honor Recipient honored, Army Birthday Celebrated at National Infantry Museum, By Lori Egan, Retrieved 4 February 2010, http://www.army.mil/-news/2009/06/16/22751-medal-of-honor-recipient-honored-army-birthday-celebrated-at-national-infantry-museum/</ref>\n\n==MPAA rating==\nThe rating is cited as \"rated PG-13 on appeal for strong language throughout, violent situations and some drug references.\" The documentary was originally given an R rating by the [[Motion Picture Association of America|MPAA]] for its language. However, Tucker asked the MPAA to reconsider, saying as it goes: \"The video shows real life in the army overseas and the importance of the younger audiences to connect and understand what soldiers have to go through.\" A petition was also started. Considering the combat conditions facing the human subjects of a war documentary, the language, while strong, did not constitute constant profanity. A PG-13 rating was granted on appeal. The documentary contains 42 uses of \"[[fuck]]\" and its derivatives, more than any other PG-13 film.\n\nThe film has also been given a PG-13 equivalent M rating in Australia (recommended for adolescent audiences though any age is still allowed access). It also got a 15 rating in the UK (illegal for those under 15 to see in cinemas), 14A in most provinces of Canada (under 14s require guardian) and an M rating in New Zealand (Recommended for 13 and over).\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.pepperandbones.com Filmmaker website]\n* {{official website|http://www.gunnerpalace.com/}}\n* {{IMDb title|0424129|Gunner Palace}}\n* {{allrovi movie|314099|Gunner Palace}}\n* {{mojo title|gunnerpalace|Gunner Palace}}\n* {{rotten-tomatoes|gunner_palace|Gunner Palace}}\n* {{Metacritic film|title=Gunner Palace}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070227065341/http://dev.epic-usa.org/files/EPIC/the_Ground_truth_Powers.pdf Interview with Cpt.
