Her interpersonal relationships are almost completely online and on the phone, with the exception of forgettable interactions with her neighbors and visits to her mother, who is institutionalized with [[Alzheimer's disease]] and often forgets who Bennett is. Bennett's co-worker Dale sends her a [[floppy disk]] of the game \"Mozart's Ghost\" with a [[backdoor (computing)|backdoor]] labeled \"[[Pi|\u03c0]]\" that permits access to a commonly used computer security system called \"Gatekeeper\" sold by Gregg Microsystems, a software company led by CEO Jeff Gregg. Dale and Bennett agree to meet, but the navigation system in Dale's private aircraft malfunctions and it crashes into a tower, killing him.\n\nBennett travels to [[Cozumel]] on vacation, where she meets Jack Devlin. After seducing Bennett, Devlin pays a [[Robber|mugger]] to steal her purse as they walk along the beach. He chases the mugger into the foliage, catches the mugger, and roots through the purse to find the disk before shooting the mugger. He takes Bennett out on his speedboat to kill her as well, but she finds his gun and confronts him. While fleeing with the disk and Devlin's wallet, Bennett's [[dinghy]] collides with rocks. She is unconscious in the hospital for three days.\n\nWhen Bennett wakes up, she finds that the disk was ruined by the sun and all records of her life have been deleted: She was checked out of her hotel room in Cancun, her car is no longer at the airport parking lot, and her credit cards are invalid. Bennett's home is now empty and listed for sale. Moreover, because none of the neighbors remember her, they cannot confirm her identity. Bennett's [[Social Security number]] is now assigned to a \"Ruth Marx\", for whom Devlin has entered an arrest record by using the Gatekeeper backdoor to hack the police computer system. When Bennett calls her own desk at Cathedral Software, an imposter answers and offers Bennett her old life back in exchange for the disk. She contacts the only other person who knows her by sight, psychiatrist and former lover Alan Champion. He checks her into a hotel, offers to contact a friend at the [[FBI]], and arranges to have her mother moved for her safety.\n\nUsing her knowledge of the backdoor and a password found in Devlin's wallet, Bennett logs into the [[Bethesda Naval Hospital]]'s computers and learns that Under Secretary of Defense Bergstrom, who had opposed Gatekeeper's use by the federal government, was murdered by altering the results of his HIV test leading to a misdiagnosis. Fellow hacker \"Cyberbob\" connects \u03c0 with the \"Praetorians\", a notorious group of [[cyberterrorist]]s linked to recent computer failures around the country. Bennett and Cyberbob plan to meet, but the Praetorians intercept their online chat. Bennett escapes from Devlin&mdash;a [[contract killer]] for the cyberterrorists, but the Praetorians kill Champion by tampering with pharmacy and hospital computer records. After Bennett is arrested by the [[California Highway Patrol]], a man identifying himself as Champion's FBI friend frees her from jail. She realizes he is an imposter and escapes again.\n\nNow wanted for murder and thought to be Ruth Marx, Bennett hitchhikes to Cathedral's office where, using her imposter's computer, she connects the cyberterrorists to Gregg Microsystems and uncovers their scheme: once the Praetorians sabotage an organization's computer system, Gregg sells Gatekeeper to it and gains unlimited access through the backdoor. Bennett [[email]]s evidence of the backdoor and Gregg's involvement with the Praetorians to the FBI from the [[Moscone Center]] and tricks Devlin into releasing a [[Computer virus|virus]] into Gregg's mainframe, destroying Gatekeeper and undoing the erasure of her identity. During a battle on the catwalks of the convention center, in which Devlin accidentally kills the Bennett imposter from Cathedral Software (the real Ruth Marx), Bennett ambushes Devlin with a fire extinguisher, causing him to fall to his death. Bennett regains her identity, home, and life. She then reunites with her mother, and the conspiracy is exposed, with Jeff Gregg being arrested by the FBI, live on television.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Sandra Bullock]] as Angela Bennett\n* [[Jeremy Northam]] as Jack Devlin\n* [[Dennis Miller]] as Dr. Alan Champion\n* [[Diane Baker]] as Mrs. Bennett\n* Wendy Gazelle as Imposter (Ruth Marx)\n* [[Ken Howard]] as Bergstrom\n* [[Ray McKinnon (actor)|Ray McKinnon]] as Dale\n* Gerald Berns as Jeff Gregg\n}}\n\n==Production==\nIn October 1994, Bullock committed to filming ''The Net'' from mid-January through April 10, 1995.<ref>{{cite news |newspaper= [[Chicago Sun Times]] |date=October 24, 1994|title=Thriller may 'Net' Actress Over $2 Million |page=38 |accessdate=October 2, 2012 |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-4253931.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140611131812/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-4253931.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=June 11, 2014}}</ref> ''The Net'' was filmed in San Francisco's [[Moscone Center]] and [[Macworld \u2013 iWorld|Macworld]] on January 5, 1995,<ref>{{cite news |newspaper= [[San Francisco Examiner]] |date=January 6, 1995 |title= She Parked The Bus Outside |page=A25 }}</ref> as well as at [[Washington, D.C.]], locations in April 1995.<ref>{{cite news |newspaper= [[Los Angeles Daily News]] |date=March 1, 1995 |title=At Work On 2 Projects, Bullock Going Full-Speed Ahead |page=L2 |author= Marilyn Beck & Stacy Jenel Smith|accessdate=October 2, 2012|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-24994524.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140611131806/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-24994524.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=June 11, 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Box office===\nWith an estimated budget of $22 million and a release date of {{nowrap|July 28, 1995}}, ''The Net'' grossed $50.7 million in the United States and Canada.
