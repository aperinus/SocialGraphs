It stars [[Clint Eastwood]] as Jed Cooper, an innocent man who survives a [[lynching]]; [[Inger Stevens]] as a widow who helps him; [[Ed Begley]] as the leader of the gang that lynched Cooper; and [[Pat Hingle]] as the federal judge who hires him as a Deputy [[U.S. Marshal]].\n\n''Hang 'Em High'' was the first production of [[Malpaso Productions|The Malpaso Company]], Eastwood's production company.\n\nHingle portrays a fictional [[judge]] who mirrors Judge [[Isaac Parker]], labeled the \"Hanging Judge\" due to the large number of men he sentenced to be executed during his service, during the late 1800s, as District Judge of the United States District Court of the Western District of Arkansas.\n\nThe film also depicts the dangers of serving as a Deputy U.S. Marshal during that period, as many federal marshals were killed while serving under Parker. The fictional Fort Grant, base for operations for that district judge seat, is also a mirror of the factual [[Fort Smith, Arkansas]], where Judge Parker's court was located.\n\n==Plot==\nIn [[Oklahoma Territory]] in 1889, retired lawman Jed Cooper is surrounded by a [[Posse comitatus (common law)|posse]] of nine men: Captain Wilson, Reno, Miller, Jenkins, Stone, Maddow, Tommy, Loomis, and Charlie Blackfoot. They demand the receipt for the cattle Cooper is driving. The cattle seller is a robber who killed the rancher. Cooper explains that he knew nothing about the murder, but only Jenkins expresses doubts about his guilt. After Reno takes Cooper's horse and saddle and Miller takes his wallet, the men [[Lynching|hang]] him from a tree and ride away.\n\nShortly afterward, [[US Marshal|Marshal]] Dave Bliss rescues a half-dead Cooper and takes him to Fort Grant, where the territorial [[judge]], Adam Fenton, determines that Cooper is innocent, sets him free, and warns him not to [[vigilante|take his own revenge]]. As an alternative, Fenton offers Cooper a job as a marshal. Cooper accepts, and Fenton warns him not to kill the lynchers, but to bring them in for trial.\n\nWhile picking up a prisoner, Cooper sees his horse and saddle in front of a local saloon. He finds Reno inside and tries to arrest him, but Reno draws his gun, forcing Cooper to gun him down. Jenkins, learning of Reno's death at the hands of a marshal with a hanging scar, turns himself in and provides the names of the rest of the posse. Cooper finds Stone in the town of Red Creek, arrests him, and has the local sheriff, Ray Calhoun, put him in jail. Most of the men Cooper seeks are respected citizens of Red Creek, but Calhoun honors Cooper's warrants for their arrest.\n\nWhile en route to arrest the other men, Cooper and Calhoun come across the murder of two men and the rustling of their herd. Cooper forms a posse of his own to pursue the stolen herd, and discovers that the rustlers are Miller and two teenage brothers, Ben and Billy Joe. He prevents the rustlers from being lynched themselves, then takes them to Fort Grant single-handedly when the posse deserts him. He frees Ben and Billy Joe from their bonds after they insist that only Miller committed the murders. Miller attacks Cooper after slipping his own bonds, but Cooper subdues him.\n\nFenton sentences all three rustlers to be hanged, despite Cooper's defense of the teenagers. Fenton insists that the public will resort to lynching if they see rustlers going unpunished, threatening Oklahoma's bid for statehood. Some time later, Calhoun arrives at Fort Grant and offers to pay Cooper for his lost cattle with money from Captain Wilson and the other lynchers. Cooper makes it clear that while they are alive he still intends to arrest them. With the bribe rejected, Blackfoot and Maddow flee, while Tommy and Loomis remain loyal to Wilson and agree to help him kill Cooper.\n\nDuring a public hanging for Miller, the brothers, and three other men, the lynchers ambush Cooper in a brothel, seriously wounding him. Cooper survives and is slowly nursed back to health by a widow, Rachel Warren. Rachel reveals she is hunting for the outlaws who killed her husband and raped her. She and Cooper begin an affair; he says that she might never find her rapists. Cooper tries to resign, but Judge Fenton gives him the location of Wilson's ranch, where Wilson, Tommy, and Loomis are hiding.\n\nCooper survives another ambush, stabs Loomis to death, shoots Tommy, and nearly apprehends Wilson before he commits suicide. After returning to Fort Grant, Cooper hands in his marshal's star and demands that Fenton sign a pardon for Jenkins, who is both contrite and seriously ill. The two men debate the merits of territorial justice; Fenton insists that he is doing as well as he can, cursing the fact that his is the only court in the territory with little recourse for plaintiffs, and that if Cooper disagrees with him, then the best thing he can do is to help Oklahoma become a state (and thus get proper courts) by continuing to serve as a marshal. Cooper takes back his star in exchange for Jenkins' release. Fenton then gives Cooper fresh warrants for Blackfoot and Maddow, telling him, \"The law still wants 'em.\"\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Clint Eastwood]] as Marshal Jed Cooper\n* [[Inger Stevens]] as Rachel Warren\n* [[Ed Begley]] as Captain Wilson\n* [[Pat Hingle]] as Judge Adam Fenton\n* [[Ben Johnson (actor)|Ben Johnson]] as Marshal Dave Bliss\n* [[Charles McGraw]] as Sheriff Ray Calhoun\n* [[Ruth White (actress)|Ruth White]] as Madame \"Peaches\" Sophie\n* [[Bruce Dern]] as Miller\n* [[Alan Hale Jr.]] as Matt Stone\n* [[Arlene Golonka]] as Jennifer\n* [[James Westerfield]] as Prisoner\n* [[Dennis Hopper]] as The Prophet\n* [[L.

Eastwood, however, did not approve and preferred the script for ''Hang 'Em High'', but had one complaint which he voiced to the producers: the scene before the six-man hanging, where the hero is attacked by the enemies. Eastwood believed that the scene would not be believable if set in a saloon. They eventually agreed to introduce a scene with Cooper taking a prostitute upstairs during the hanging, and having the attack take place afterwards as Eastwood enters the bordello's bar.<ref name=\"McGillagan160\">McGillagan (1999), p.160-1</ref> Eastwood signed for the film with a salary of $400,000 and 25% of the net earnings of the film, playing the character of Jed Cooper, a man accused by vigilantes of a rancher's murder, lynched and left for dead, who later seeks revenge.<ref name=\"Hughes18\"/><ref name=\"Munn69\"/><ref name=\"McGillagan160\"/>\n\nWith the wealth generated by the ''Dollars'' trilogy, Irving Leonard helped set up Eastwood's long-desired new production company, [[Malpaso Productions|The Malpaso Company]], named after [[Malpaso Creek]], which flows through property Eastwood formerly owned in [[Monterey County, California]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Rancho Ca\u00f1ada Village|url=http://www.pineconearchive.com/ranchocanada.pdf|newspaper=Carmel Pine Cone|access-date=December 7, 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"McGillagan162\">McGillagan (1999), p.162</ref> Leonard became the company's president and arranged for ''Hang 'Em High'' to be a joint production with United Artists.<ref name=\"McGillagan162\"/> Directors [[Robert Aldrich]] and [[John Sturges]] were considered for the director's helm, but on the request of Eastwood, old friend [[Ted Post]] was brought in to direct, against the wishes of Freeman, whom Eastwood overruled.<ref name=\"McGillagan163\">McGillagan (1999), p.163</ref> Post was important in casting for the film and arranged for Inger Stevens of ''[[The Farmer's Daughter (TV series)|The Farmer's Daughter]]'' fame to play the role of Rachel Warren. She had not heard of Eastwood or [[Sergio Leone]] at the time, but instantly took a liking to Clint and accepted.<ref name=\"McGillagan163\"/> Clint Eastwood and Inger Stevens began a short relationship during filming.\n\n===Score===\nComposer [[Dominic Frontiere]] was given eight days to compose an [[Ennio Morricone]] type score.
