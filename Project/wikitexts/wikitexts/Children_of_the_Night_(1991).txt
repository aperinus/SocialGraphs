Its plot follows a young woman and a local schoolteacher who attempt to rid their small community of [[vampire]]s that have been inadvertently unleashed.\n\n==Plot==\nBefore going away to college, two childhood friends, Cindy Thompson and Lucy Barrett, decide to symbolically cleanse themselves of the \"dirt\" of their small town by swimming laps in a flooded, abandoned church crypt.  Lucy drops her [[crucifix]], which drifts down onto the submerged remains of an ancient vampire, Czakyr. Czakyr awakes and kills Cindy.\n\nMark Gardner ([[Peter DeLuise]]), a school teacher from a nearby town, gets directed to Allburg by an old friend of his, Father Frank Aldin (Evan Mackenzie). Once there he tries to help Lucy, as she has now become the target of a town-turned-vampires, due to her \"virgin blood\". Lucy, Mark, and a drunken preacher make camp in an abandoned building outside of town and make plans to fight the vampire army. Utilizing the preacher's \"cross mobile\" they battle Allburg's entire vampire populace, ultimately taking on the evil Czakyr. Once Czakyr has been killed, the town's folk return to normal, with some complaining of \"splinters in their chests\".\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n*[[Karen Black]] as Karen Thompson\n*Evan MacKenzie as Father Frank Aldin\n*[[Peter DeLuise]] as Mark Gardner\n*[[Ami Dolenz]] as Lucy Barrett\n*Maya McLaughlin as Cindy Thompson \n*David Sawyer as Czakyr\n*[[Garrett Morris]] as Matty\n*Shirley Spiegler Jacobs as Grandma\n*Josette DiCarlo as Officer Gates\n*Lloyd J.
