He has just finished his sixth year playing \"The Tall Guy\", a [[straight man]] in a two-man, long-running comedy [[revue]] starring (and dominated by) Ron Anderson (Rowan Atkinson, playing a role based on himself).<ref name=\"C4Film\">{{cite web|url=http://www.channel4.com/film/reviews/film.jsp?id=109065|title=The Tall Guy Review|work=Channel 4 Film|publisher=Channel 4|access-date=23 August 2008}}</ref>\n\nChronic [[hay fever]] prompts him to see a doctor, where he meets and falls quickly in love with Kate (played by Emma Thompson), who works there as a nurse.\n\nSoon after meeting Kate, Dexter is fired by Ron. After being rejected for a role in a new [[Steven Berkoff]] play for \"lacking anger\", Dexter wins the title role in a new [[Royal Shakespeare Company]] [[musical theater|musical]] based on ''[[The Elephant Man (play)|The Elephant Man]]''. It's \"a sparkily nasty send-up of [[Andrew Lloyd Webber]]\"<ref name=\"guard\"/> called ''Elephant!'' which features a song called \"He\u2019s Packing His Trunk\" and a finale which ends with the lyric \"Somewhere up in heaven there's an angel with big ears!\"\n\nDuring rehearsal, Dexter succumbs to the advances of a married co-star (played by [[Kim Thomson]]). On the new musical's opening night, Kate puts together evidence of the affair from a few subtle clues, and leaves Dexter without further ado.\n\nAfter seeing a scene in a televised award show that suggests Ron is now dating Kate, Dexter impulsively gives up his role in ''Elephant!'' just before the curtain rises, with plans to make an impassioned plea to Kate to take him back. With Ron's involuntary help (Dexter ties him up in his dressing room and steals his car), Dexter presents his case to Kate in a busy hospital ward. Kate agrees to give him another chance.\n\n==Cast==\nThe cast includes:\n{{div col}}\n* [[Jeff Goldblum]] as Dexter King\n* [[Rowan Atkinson]] as Ron Anderson\n* [[Emma Thompson]] as Kate Lemmon\n* [[Geraldine James]] as Carmen\n* [[Anna Massey]] as Mary\n* [[Kim Thomson]] as Cheryl\n* [[Hugh Thomas (actor)|Hugh Thomas]] as Dr. Karabekian\n* [[Emil Wolk]] as Cyprus Charlie\n* [[Tim Barlow]] as Mr. Morrow\n* [[Harold Innocent]] as Timothy\n* [[Joanna Kanska]] as Tamara\n* [[Angus Deayton]] as Actor in Agent's Office\n* [[Jason Isaacs]] as 2nd Doctor\n{{div col end}}\nThe film also includes [[cameo appearance]]s from [[John Inman]], [[Melvyn Bragg]], [[Suggs (singer)|Suggs]], [[Jonathan Ross]] and director [[Mel Smith]].\n\n==Production==\n[[Principal photography]] occurred in 1988.<ref>{{cite web | title= What Jeff loves about London | last= Curtis | url= http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/theatre/article-23434731-what-jeff-loves-about-london.do | date= 29 January 2008 | publisher= [[London Evening Standard]] | access-date= 14 October 2010 | url-status= dead | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110606112046/http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/theatre/article-23434731-what-jeff-loves-about-london.do | archive-date= 6 June 2011 | df= dmy-all }}</ref> Nearly twenty years later, Mel Smith, calling his directorial debut the high point of his career, commented on the directing experience:  \"I didn't know enough about the film business, and so it seemed wonderfully easy.\"<ref>{{cite news| url= https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2007/feb/06/comedy.television | title= Portrait of the artist | work= The Guardian | date= 6 February 2007 | access-date=14 October 2010 | location=London | first=Natalie | last=Hanman}}</ref>\n\n==Critical reception==\nUpon its September 1990 US release, ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' gave it a B\u2212, describing it as \"mildly charming and mostly too broad\" and accusing it of overplaying \"Dexter's dorkiness in the same way it overplays the big sex scene, the romantic montage, the breakup scene\u2026\"<ref>{{cite news| url= http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,318262,00.html | title=The Tall Guy | date=28 September 1990 |  first= Owen | last=Gleiberman  | publisher= [[Entertainment Weekly]]| access-date=14 October 2010}}</ref> Caryn James of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote \"even when its bright theatrical satire gives way to men dressed as nuns dancing in wimples and red sequined shorts, this modest comedy is always wickedly endearing, thanks to the off-kilter characters played by Mr. Goldblum and Emma Thompson as the unlikely woman of his dreams.\"<ref>{{cite news| url= https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9C0CE2DD1E31F932A1575AC0A966958260 | title= Nuns!
