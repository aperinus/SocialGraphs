Set in 1944 during the [[Second World War]], it was filmed in England at [[MGM-British Studios]] and released by [[MGM]]. The film was a box office success and won the [[Academy Award for Best Sound Editing]] at the [[40th Academy Awards]] in 1968. In 2001, the [[American Film Institute]] placed it at number 65 on their [[100 Years... 100 Thrills]] list. The screenplay is based on the 1965 bestseller by [[E. M. Nathanson]] which was inspired by a real-life WWII unit of behind-the-lines demolition specialists from the [[101st Airborne Division]] named the \"[[Filthy Thirteen]]\". Another possible inspiration was the public offer to President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] by 44 prisoners serving life sentences at the [[Oklahoma State Penitentiary]] to serve in the Pacific on suicide missions against the Japanese.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://fultonhistory.com/Login_18/New%20York%20NY%20PM%20%20Daily/New%20York%20NY%20PM%20Daily%201942/New%20York%20NY%20PM%20Daily%201942%20-%201926.pdf|title=44 Life-Termers Ask to Fight Japs as Suicide Squad}} PM, May 3, 1942</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nIn March 1944, [[Office of Strategic Services|OSS]] officer Major John Reisman is ordered by the commander of [[ADSEC]] in Britain, Major General Sam Worden, to undertake Project Amnesty, a top-secret mission to train some of the Army's worst prisoners and turn them into [[commando]]s to be sent on a virtual [[suicide mission]] just before [[D-Day]]. The target is a [[ch\u00e2teau]] near [[Rennes]] where dozens of high-ranking German officers will be eliminated in order to disrupt the chain of command of the [[Wehrmacht]] in Northern France before the Allied invasion. The prisoners who survive the mission will receive pardons for their crimes.\n\nFive prisoners are condemned to death while the others face lengthy sentences which include hard labor. With a detachment of MPs led by Sgt. Bowren acting as guards, the prisoners gradually learn how to operate together when they are forced to build their own training camp. However, when an act of insubordination is instigated by the rebellious Franko, all shaving and wash kits are withheld as punishment which leads to their nickname \"The Dirty Dozen.\" During their training the prisoners are psychoanalyzed by Capt. Kinder who warns Reisman that they would all quite likely kill him if given the chance; and rapist/killer Maggott is by far the most dangerous.\n\nWith their commando training almost complete, the \"Dirty Dozen\" are sent for parachute training at a facility commanded by Reisman's nemesis Colonel Everett Dasher Breed of the 101st Airborne Division. When Reisman's men run afoul of Breed, especially after Pinkley \u2013 under Reisman's orders \u2013 poses as a general to inspect Breed's best troops, the Airborne colonel attempts to discover Reisman's mission by having two of his men beat a confession out of one of the prisoners. The convicts blame Reisman for the attack but realize their mistake after Breed and his men arrive at their camp looking for answers. Reisman infiltrates his own camp and the convicts disarm Breed's paratroops forcing the colonel to leave in humiliation.\n\nUpon the men's completion of their training, Reisman rewards them with prostitutes, which raises the ire of General Worden and his chief of staff, Brigadier General Denton. Termination of the project is considered, which would result in sending the men back to prison for execution of their sentences. However, Reisman ferociously defends the prisoners saying each one is worth ten of Breed's best troops. Reisman's friend, Major Max Armbruster, suggests a test. During upcoming military maneuvers in southwest England, the \"Dirty Dozen\" will attempt to capture Colonel Breed's headquarters. The unit successfully infiltrates and captures Breed's war games headquarters using various unorthodox tactics. An impressed General Worden green-lights Reisman's mission.\n\nThe men parachute into northern France, but Jiminez breaks his neck during the jump. With a man down, the mission proceeds with German-speaking Wladislaw and Reisman infiltrating the chateau disguised as German officers. Pinkley stands outside posing as a German officer. Gilpin is on the roof of the building, but his leg breaks through and gets stuck. However, all surprise is lost when the psychopathic Maggott breaks cover and sets off an alarm. Gilpin with his leg stuck in the roof sacrifices himself by blowing up the antenna with hand grenades. Pinkley shoots and kills several officers before he himself is gunned down. Maggot is then shot and killed by Jefferson to protect the mission. The sound of gunfire makes the Wehrmacht officers and their companions retreat to a locked underground bomb shelter, but after gasoline has been poured down ventilation shafts, Jefferson throws the hand grenades down the shafts and runs for his life but is shot dead. \n\nAfter extensive fighting, only Reisman, Sgt Bowren, and Wladislaw escape alive. Back in England, a voiceover from Armbruster confirms that General Worden exonerated the sole surviving member of the Dirty Dozen and communicated to the next of kin of the rest that \"they lost their lives in the line of duty\".\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Lee Marvin]] as Major John Reisman\n* [[Ernest Borgnine]] as Major General Sam Worden\n* [[Charles Bronson]] as Joseph Wladislaw (prisoner #9)\n* [[Jim Brown]] as Robert T.

Nathanson's novel ''The Dirty Dozen'' while it was just an outline, [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] succeeded in May 1963. On publication, the novel became a best-seller in 1965. It was adapted to the screen by veteran scriptwriter and producer [[Nunnally Johnson]], and [[Lukas Heller]]. A repeated rhyme was written into the script where the twelve actors verbally recite the details of the attack in a rhyming chant to help them remember their roles while approaching the mission target:\n# Down to the road block, we've just begun.\n# The guards are through.\n# The Major's men are on a spree.\n# Major and Wladislaw go through the door.\n# Pinkley stays out in the drive.\n# The Major gives the rope a fix.\n# Wladislaw throws the hook to heaven.\n# Jiminez has got a date.\n# The other guys go up the line.\n# Sawyer and Gilpin are in the pen.\n# Posey guards Points Five and Seven.\n# Wladislaw and the Major go down to delve.\n# Franko goes up without being seen.\n# Zero Hour: Jiminez cuts the cable; Franko cuts the phone.\n# Franko goes in where the others have been.\n# We all come out like it's Halloween.\n\n=== Casting ===\nThe cast included many World War II US veterans including Lee Marvin, Robert Webber and Robert Ryan ([[US Marine Corps]]); Telly Savalas and George Kennedy ([[US Army]]); Charles Bronson ([[US Army Air Forces]]); Ernest Borgnine ([[US Navy]]); and Clint Walker ([[US Merchant Marine]]).\n\n[[John Wayne]] was the original choice for Reisman, but he turned down the role because he objected to the adultery present in the original script, which featured the character having a relationship with an Englishwoman whose husband was fighting on the Continent.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Roberts |first1=Randy |last2=Olsen |first2=James Stuart |title=John Wayne: American |year=1997 |publisher=University of Nebraska Press |location=Omaha |page=537}}</ref> [[Jack Palance]] refused the \"Archer Maggott\" role when they would not rewrite the script to make his character lose his racism; Telly Savalas took the role instead.<ref>{{cite journal| title=Actor Jack Palance Won't Play Racist for $141,000| page=59| journal=Jet| date=March 10, 1966| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bbkDAAAAMBAJ&dq=%22jack+palance%22+%22dirty+dozen%22&pg=PA59| volume=XXIX| number=22| access-date=February 6, 2020| archive-date=March 15, 2020| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200315155342/https://books.google.com/books?id=bbkDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA59&dq=%22jack+palance%22+%22dirty+dozen%22| url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nSix of the dozen were experienced American stars, while the \"Back Six\" were actors resident in the UK, Englishman [[Colin Maitland]], Canadians Donald Sutherland and [[Tom Busby]], and Americans [[Stuart Cooper]], [[Al Mancini]], and [[Ben Carruthers]].

He was unable to find any corroboration in the archives of the US Army in Europe. He instead turned his research of convicted felons into the subsequent novel. He does not state where he acquired the name, but Arch Whitehouse coined the name \"Dirty Dozen\" as the 12 enlisted men of the airborne section that became the \"Filthy Thirteen\" after the lieutenant joined their ranks. In Arch Whitehouse's article in ''True Magazine'', he claimed that all the enlisted men were full-blood Indians, but in reality only their leader Jake McNeice was one-quarter Choctaw. The parts of the Filthy Thirteen story that carried over into Nathanson's book were not bathing until the jump into Normandy, their disrespect for military authority, and the pre-invasion party. The Filthy Thirteen was actually a demolitions section with a mission to secure bridges over the [[Douve]] on D-Day.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Yardley |first1=William |title=Jake McNiece, Who Led Incorrigible D-Day Unit, Is Dead at 93 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/14/us/jake-mcniece-a-leader-of-wwiis-filthy-13-dies-at-93.html |access-date=April 8, 2016 |work=The New York Times |date=February 13, 2013 |archive-date=March 12, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160312103536/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/14/us/jake-mcniece-a-leader-of-wwiis-filthy-13-dies-at-93.html |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=World War II soldier John (Jack) Agnew, whose unit inspired 'Dirty Dozen,' dies at 88 |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/world-war-ii-soldier-john-jack-agnew-unit-inspired-dirty-dozen-dies-88-article-1.169241 |access-date=April 8, 2016 |work=[[New York Daily News]] |agency=[[Associated Press]] |date=April 12, 2010 |archive-date=April 5, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160405202701/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/world-war-ii-soldier-john-jack-agnew-unit-inspired-dirty-dozen-dies-88-article-1.169241 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nA unit called the \"[[Filthy Thirteen]]\" was an airborne demolition unit documented in the eponymous book,<ref>{{cite book |title=The Filthy Thirteen: From the Dustbowl to Hitler's Eagle's Nest: The True Story of the 101st Airborne's Most Legendary Squad of Combat Paratroopers |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N5TU2t6GuaUC&q=The+Filthy+Thirteen:+From+the+Dustbowl+to+Hitler%27s+Eagle%27s+Nest:+The+True+Story+of+the+101st+Airborne%27s+Most+Legendary+Squad+of+Combat+Paratroopers |first1=Richard |last1=Killblane |first2=Jake |last2=McNiece |date=May 19, 2003 |publisher=Casemate |isbn=978-1935149811 |access-date=February 6, 2020 |archive-date=April 20, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210420234938/https://books.google.com/books?id=N5TU2t6GuaUC&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+Filthy+Thirteen:+From+the+Dustbowl+to+Hitler's+Eagle's+Nest:+The+True+Story+of+the+101st+Airborne's+Most+Legendary+Squad+of+Combat+Paratroopers&hl=en&newbks=1&newbks_redir=0&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiE3aTj2LznAhXFnOAKHTzQDSYQ6AEwAHoECAIQAg#v=onepage&q&f=false |url-status=live }}</ref> and this unit's exploits inspired the fictional account.

[[Roger Ebert]], who was in his first year as a film reviewer for the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'', wrote sarcastically:\n\n<blockquote>I'm glad the Chicago Police Censor Board forgot about that part of the local censorship law where it says films shall not depict the burning of the human body. If you have to censor, stick to censoring sex, I say...but leave in the mutilation, leave in the sadism and by all means leave in the human beings burning to death. It's not obscene as long as they burn to death with their clothes on.<ref>{{cite web | first=Roger| last=Ebert |author-link=Roger Ebert | title=The Dirty Dozen| url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19670726/REVIEWS/707260301/1023| date=July 26, 1967| newspaper=[[Chicago Sun-Times]] | access-date=2010-03-29| archive-date=September 23, 2012| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120923100019/http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F19670726%2FREVIEWS%2F707260301%2F1023| url-status=dead }}</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn another contemporaneous review, [[Bosley Crowther]] called it \"an astonishingly wanton [[war film]]\" and a \"studied indulgence of [[Sadomasochism|sadism]] that is morbid and disgusting beyond words\"; he also noted:\n\n<blockquote>It is not simply that this violent picture of an American military venture is based on a fictional supposition that is silly and irresponsible. ... But to have this bunch of felons a totally incorrigible lot, some of them psychopathic, and to try to make us believe that they would be committed by any American general to carry out an exceedingly important raid that a regular commando group could do with equal efficiency\u2014and certainly with greater dependability\u2014is downright preposterous.<ref name=\"nyt67\">{{cite news| first=Bosley| last=Crowther| title=The Dirty Dozen (1967)| newspaper=The New York Times| date=June 16, 1967| url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=EE05E7DF173DE267BC4E52DFB066838C679EDE| access-date=2010-03-29| archive-date=June 3, 2021| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210603101515/https://www.nytimes.com/reviews/movies| url-status=dead }}</ref></blockquote>\n\nCrowther called some of the portrayals \"bizarre and bold\":\n\n<blockquote>Marvin's taut, pugnacious playing of the major ... is tough and terrifying. John Cassavetes is wormy and noxious as a psychopath condemned to death, and Telly Savalas is swinish and maniacal as a religious fanatic and sex degenerate. Charles Bronson as an alienated murderer, Richard Jaeckel as a hard-boiled military policeman, and Jim Brown as a white-hating Negro stand out in the animalistic group.<ref name=\"nyt67\"/></blockquote>\n\nArt Murphy of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' was more positive, calling it \"an exciting World War II pre-D-Day drama\" with an \"excellent cast\" and a \"very good screenplay\" with \"a ring of authenticity to it\".<ref name=varrev>{{cite magazine| title=Film Reviews: The Dirty Dozen| magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]| url=https://variety.com/1966/film/reviews/the-dirty-dozen-1200421273/| archive-url=https://archive.today/20130205133757/http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117790448.html| archive-date=February 5, 2013|date=June 21, 1967|page=6|last=Murphy|first=A.D.| access-date=March 29, 2010}}</ref>\n\nThe ''Time Out Film Guide'' notes that over the years, \"''The Dirty Dozen'' has taken its place alongside that other commercial classic, ''[[The Magnificent Seven]]''\". The review then states:\n\n<blockquote>The violence which liberal critics found so offensive has survived intact. Aldrich sets up dispensable characters with no past and no future, as Marvin reprieves a bunch of death row prisoners, forges them into a tough fighting unit, and leads them on a suicide mission into Nazi France. Apart from the values of team spirit, cudgeled by Marvin into his dropout group, Aldrich appears to be against everything: anti-military, anti-Establishment, anti-women, anti-religion, anti-culture, anti-life. Overriding such nihilism is the super-crudity of Aldrich's energy and his humour, sufficiently cynical to suggest that the whole thing is a game anyway, a spectacle that demands an audience.<ref>{{cite news| title=The Dirty Dozen| url=https://www.timeout.com/london/film/the-dirty-dozen| journal=[[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out]]| access-date=2017-06-13| archive-date=June 7, 2017| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170607142937/https://www.timeout.com/london/film/the-dirty-dozen| url-status=live}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n=== Accolades ===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n!
