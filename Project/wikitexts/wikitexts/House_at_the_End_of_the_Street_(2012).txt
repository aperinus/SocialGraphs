The film's plot revolves around a teenage girl, Elissa, who along with her newly divorced mother Sarah, moves to a new neighborhood only to discover that the house at the end of the street was the site of a gruesome double homicide committed by a thirteen-year-old girl named Carrie Anne who had disappeared without a trace four years prior. Elissa then starts a relationship with Carrie Anne's older brother Ryan, who lives in the same house, but nothing is as it appears to be.\n\nAlthough filming had been completed in 2010, the film was not released until 2012 by [[Relativity Media]]. Despite a negative response from critics, the film was a moderate commercial success.\n\n==Plot==\nNewly divorced medical doctor Sarah Cassidy ([[Elisabeth Shue]]) and her 17-year-old daughter Elissa ([[Jennifer Lawrence]]) move to a small, upscale [[suburb]]. They are disturbed to discover the house they are moving into is on the same street as a house in which a family used to live until the parents were murdered. The story of the massacre is told to them by the neighbors. Four years prior, a girl named Carrie-Anne Jacobson killed her parents, then fled into the forest and was never seen again, leaving her brother Ryan ([[Max Thieriot]]) as the sole survivor. Ryan now lives alone and is hated by his neighbors; Bill Weaver ([[Gil Bellows]]), a local police officer, appears to be Ryan's only supporter.\n\nTheir mother-daughter relationship becomes rocky and Elissa starts seeing Ryan against her mother's wishes, finding Ryan to be lonely but a sweet boy. Ryan confides in her that he accidentally injured Carrie-Anne by allowing her to fall from a [[Swing (seat)|swing]] when they were little; he was supposed to be watching her while their parents were getting high on drugs. The resulting [[brain damage]] from the accident made her extremely aggressive, leading to their parents' murder.  Ryan is revealed to have been secretly taking care of a seemingly now-grown Carrie-Anne (Eva Link) in a hidden room. Carrie-Anne manages to escape and approaches a young couple in a car while brandishing a kitchen knife. Ryan catches up to her before she can reach the couple but accidentally kills her while trying to hide her. In grief, he goes to a diner, where he meets a kind waitress named Peggy Johns ([[Jordan Hayes]]).\n\nLater, some unruly high school boys pick a fight with Ryan and he flees, and Elissa drives to his house and subdues a fire the boys started. She finds tampons in the kitchen garbage and explores the house with suspicion until she finds the secret room and is attacked by Carrie-Anne, who is revealed to actually be Peggy. Ryan restrains \"Carrie-Anne\" while frantically screaming at Elissa to leave. Elissa finds blue contact lenses and Peggy Johns's wallet in the kitchen. Ryan has kidnapped the waitress and attempted to make her look like Carrie-Anne. Elissa tells Ryan she has to go home but Ryan hits her, knocking her unconscious.\n\nElissa wakes to find herself tightly tied to a chair. Ryan reveals to her that Carrie Anne didn't kill their parents. In fact, she died during the accident on the swing set. It was Ryan who killed their parents, after suffering years of abuse because they blamed him for his younger sister's death. This leads to the final revelation: The \"Carrie Annes\" he has been keeping in the basement were kidnapped women who he made up to look just like his younger sister.\u00a0\nHe explains that he wants Elissa, but that he needs Carrie-Anne and knows that he cannot have both. Officer Weaver goes to Ryan's house to look for Elissa, but Ryan stabs him to death. Elissa frees herself and tries to escape in Ryan's car, but Ryan knocks her out with [[chloroform]] and traps her in his car trunk with Peggy's body. Sarah arrives and is also stabbed by Ryan. Elissa struggles out of the car and ultimately shoots Ryan with Weaver's gun. When she approaches him, he suddenly wakes up and grabs her wrist. When Ryan attempts to stab Elissa with the knife, Sarah strikes him in the head with the hammer.\n\nElissa and Sarah move out and Ryan is placed in a [[Psychiatric hospital|psychiatric ward]]. A [[Flashback (psychology)|flashback]] had depicted Young Ryan in girl's clothing about to blow out birthday candles. His mother calls him \"Carrie-Anne\" and when Ryan protested that his name is Ryan, she just slapped him violently. While doing a puzzle, Ryan begins to [[Auditory hallucination|hear the voices of his deceased parents]] saying that he is Carrie-Anne.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Jennifer Lawrence]] as Elissa Cassidy\n* [[Max Thieriot]] as Ryan Jacobson\n** Bobby Osborne as Young Ryan\n* [[Elisabeth Shue]] as Dr.Sarah Cassidy\n* [[Gil Bellows]] as Officer Bill Weaver\n* Eva Link as \"Carrie Anne\" \n* Grace Tucker-Duguay as Carrie Anne Jacobson (flashbacks)\n* [[Nolan Gerard Funk]] as Tyler Reynolds\n* [[Allie MacDonald]] as Jillian\n* [[Jordan Hayes (actress)|Jordan Hayes]] as Peggy Johns\n* Krista Bridges as Mary Jacobson (flashbacks)\n* John Healy as Johnathon \"John\" Jacobson (flashbacks)\n}}\n\n==Production==\nThe film was originally announced in 2003 with [[Jonathan Mostow]] directing and [[Richard Kelly (director)|Richard Kelly]] writing.<ref>{{cite web |date=22 June 2004 |last1=Soong |first1=Jennifer |title=Richard Kelly's Second Chance: The Director Reflects on How Donnie Darko Became a Cult Hit |url=https://www.moviemaker.com/richard-kellys-second-chance-2922/ |website=MovieMaker Magazine }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |date=21 September 2012 |last1=Taylor |first1=Drew |title=Review: 'House At The End Of The Street' Is Like 'Twilight' Meets 'The Devil's Rejects' (And Totally Awful) |url=https://www.indiewire.com/2012/09/review-house-at-the-end-of-the-street-is-like-twilight-meets-the-devils-rejects-and-totally-awful-105775/ |website=IndieWire |quote=originally supposed to be a collaborative horror movie, written and directed by \u201cDonnie Darko\u201d filmmaker Richard Kelly and Jonathan Mostow }}</ref> The film went through [[development hell]] for seven years until production was revived in 2010 with [[Mark Tonderai]] directing and [[David Loucka]] writing, instead.\n\nPrincipal photography and filming mostly took place in [[Metcalfe, Ontario]] and [[Carp, Ontario]] from August 2, 2010, until September 3, 2010.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ottawasun.com/entertainment/movies/2010/07/27/14845706.html |title=Horror flick to film in Ottawa |work=[[Ottawa Sun]] |publisher=[[Postmedia Network]] |date=July 27, 2010 |access-date=January 7, 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303235235/http://www.ottawasun.com/entertainment/movies/2010/07/27/14845706.html |archive-date=March 3, 2016|first=Doug|last=Hempstead}}</ref>\n\n==Release==\nThe film was originally scheduled to be released in February 2012,<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.movieweb.com/news/house-at-the-end-of-the-street-gets-february-2012-release-date | title=House at the End of the Street Gets February 2012 Release Date |work=[[MovieWeb]] |publisher=Watchr Media |date=April 22, 2011 |first=Brian |last=Gallagher | access-date=October 6, 2011}}</ref> but was moved to a September 2012 release.

The extended edition increased the length of certain scenes in the final cut by a few seconds and the amount of violence, blood, and gore was increased by a small amount.\n\nThe extended cut also included an additional twist, in which Bill Weaver was actually a close family friend of the Jacobsons and was aware of Carrie-Anne's fate, and he also knew about Ryan's abuse but did nothing to help him. On the day of Carrie-Anne's accident, he supplied John and Mary Jacobson with drugs and actually could have prevented Carrie-Anne's death if he had not sold them the drugs, as they had prevented John and Mary from heeding the cries of their only son, and he was then disowned as a close friend by John Jacobson.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Box office===\nThe film debuted at number one at the US box office on its opening Friday and Saturday nights.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://boxofficemojo.com/daily/chart/?sortdate=2012-09-21&p=.htm |title=Daily Box Office for Friday, September 21, 2012 |work=[[Box Office Mojo]]|publisher=[[IMDb]]|access-date=July 3, 2018}}</ref> In what was one of the tightest races in years for first place at the box-office weekend, the film finished the weekend at number two with $12.3 million, just less than a million behind ''[[End of Watch]]'', which included takings from Thursday night through Monday morning, where that movie finished at number one, with $13.1 million.<ref name=\"Subers\" /> The film went on to gross over $44 million worldwide, from a budget of $6.9-10 million.<ref name=\"Numbers\"/><ref name=\"BoxOfficeMojo\">{{cite web |title=House at the End of the Street |url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/title/tt1582507/ |website=[[Box Office Mojo]]}}</ref>\n\n===Critical reception===\nOn [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film has an approval rating of 13% based on 66 reviews with an average rating of 3.72/10.
