[[Claudine West]], [[George Froeschel]], and [[Arthur Wimperis]] adapted the novel for the screen, and received an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nomination. The novel keeps the true identity of Paula/Margaret a secret until the very end, something that would have been impossible in a film, where characters\u2019 faces must be seen. This meant that the movie had to take a very different approach to the story. The film stars [[Ronald Colman]] as a [[Combat stress reaction|shellshocked]], [[amnesia]]c World War I veteran, and [[Greer Garson]] as his love interest.\n\nThe film was an instant commercial success and was nominated for seven [[Academy Awards]], including [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] for Colman, [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]] for [[Susan Peters]], [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]] for [[Mervyn LeRoy]] and [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]]. Garson, whose performance was well-received, was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Actress]] (and won) that year for her role in ''[[Mrs. Miniver]]''.\n\n==Plot==\nIn England in November 1918, \"John Smith\" is a British officer who was [[Poison gas|gassed]] in the [[Trench warfare|trenches]] during the [[World War I|First World War]]. Having lost his memory, and apparently with no means of identification, he is confined to an asylum as an unidentified inmate. A couple visits him, only to see that he is not their missing son, which disappoints him as much as them. On the day the war ends, the gatekeepers abandon their posts to join the celebration in the nearby Midlands town of Melbridge, and Smith wanders out of the asylum.\n\n[[File:Greer Garson in Random Harvest trailer 2.jpg|left|thumb|200px|Greer Garson from the trailer for ''Random Harvest'']]\nIn town, he is befriended by a singer with the stage name Paula Ridgeway. She guesses he is from the asylum, but as he seems harmless, she arranges for him to join her traveling theatrical group. After an incident that threatens to bring unwanted attention, Paula takes Smith to a secluded country village in Devon, where they stay at an inn run by Mrs. Deventer. As time passes, they fall in love and happily marry, renting a small cottage and eventually having a son.\n\n\"Smithy\", as Paula calls him, discovers he has some literary talent. Paula remains home with their newborn son while Smithy goes to [[Liverpool]] for a job interview with a newspaper. He is struck by a taxi, and when he regains consciousness, his past memory is restored, but his life with Paula is now forgotten. His true identity is Charles Rainier, the son of a wealthy businessman. None of his meager possessions, including a key, provide any clue about where he has been. Charles returns home on the day of his father's funeral. Kitty, the stepdaughter of one of Charles' siblings, becomes infatuated with her \"uncle\". Charles wants to return to college, but the mismanaged family business needs him, and he puts off his own desires to safeguard the jobs of his many employees and restore the family fortune. After a few years, a newspaper touts him as the \"Industrial Prince of England\".\n\nMeanwhile, Paula has been searching frantically for her Smithy. Their son died as an infant, and she now works as a secretary. One day, she sees Charles' picture and story in a magazine. Paula gets hired as his executive assistant under her real name, Margaret Hanson, hoping that her presence will jog his memory. Dr. Jonathan Benet, an employee at the asylum from which Charles escaped, has become her confidant and admirer. He warns her that revealing her identity would only cause Charles to resent her. As Kitty grows up, she sends Charles love letters, and they become engaged. However, a hymn that Kitty is considering for their upcoming wedding triggers a vague memory in Charles. Kitty, realizing that Charles still loves someone else, sadly breaks off the engagement.\n \nMargaret joins Charles in Liverpool, where he is trying one last time to piece together his lost years. They recover his suitcase from a hotel, but he recognizes nothing. Charles is approached to stand for [[Parliament of England|Parliament]]. After his election, in which Margaret provides invaluable assistance, he feels the need for a wife in his new role. He proposes to her, more as a business proposition than a romantic one, and she accepts. They become an ideal couple, at least to all outward appearances, with Margaret a perfect society hostess. In a moment of reflection, they discuss his lost past, and she tells him of her own lost love, without revealing that it is Charles. He hopes their life together can fill the void they both feel.\n\nAfter three years of marriage, Margaret still has no success in triggering her husband's memories. To cope with her frustration, she decides to take an extended solo vacation abroad. Before her [[Ocean liner|liner]] sails, she revisits the village where she and Smithy lived. When Charles sees her off at the train station, he is summoned to mediate a strike at the Melbridge Cable Works. After the successful negotiation, he walks through the town, and the surroundings and celebrations begin to unlock his memories, leading him to the nearby village and the cottage he and Paula shared. Hesitantly, he tries the old key he kept, and finds that it unlocks the door. Margaret, about to leave for her boat, makes a casual remark to the innkeeper about her predecessor, Mrs. Deventer. The innkeeper tells her that a gentleman just that morning had inquired about Mrs. Deventer, and had mentioned that he used to rent a cottage near a church. Margaret hurries to the cottage and finds Charles standing at the front door. She tentatively calls out \"Smithy?\" Charles turns to see her behind him, and his face slowly lights up with recognition. As he rushes to embrace her, he calls her Paula, his memories finally returning.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Ronald Colman]] as Charles Rainier/\"Smithy\"\n*[[Greer Garson]] as \"Paula Ridgeway\"/Margaret Hanson\n*[[Philip Dorn]] as Dr. Jonathan Benet\n*[[Susan Peters]] as Kitty Chilcet\n*[[Henry Travers]] as Dr. Sims\n*[[Reginald Owen]] as Biffer\n*[[Bramwell Fletcher]] as Harrison\n*[[Rhys Williams (Welsh-American actor)|Rhys Williams]] as Sam\n*[[Una O'Connor (actress)|Una O'Connor]] as Tobacco Shopkeeper\n*[[Aubrey Mather]] as Sheldon\n*[[Margaret Wycherly]] as Mrs. Deventer\n*[[Arthur Margetson]] as Chetwynd Rainier\n*[[Melville Cooper]] as George Rainier\n*[[Alan Napier]] as Julian Rainier\n*[[Jill Esmond]] as Lydia Rainier\n*[[Ivan F.
