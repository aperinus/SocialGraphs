An adaptation of [[John Willard (playwright)|John Willard]]'s 1922 [[black comedy|black-comedy]] play [[The Cat and the Canary (play)|of the same name]], the film stars [[Laura La Plante]] as Annabelle West, [[Forrest Stanley]] as Charlie Wilder, and [[Creighton Hale]] as Paul Jones. The plot revolves around the death of Cyrus West, who is Annabelle, Charlie, and Paul's uncle, and the reading of his [[last will and testament|will]] twenty years later. Annabelle inherits her uncle's fortune, but when she and her family spend the night in his haunted mansion, they are stalked by a mysterious figure. Meanwhile, a [[lunatic]] mainly known as the Cat escapes from an asylum and hides in the mansion.\n\nThe film is part of the genre of [[List of comedy horror films|comedy horror films]] inspired by 1920s [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] stage plays. Leni's adaptation of Willard's play blended expressionism with humor, a style for which Leni was notable and recognized by critics as unique. His directing style made ''The Cat and the Canary'' influential in the \"old dark house\" genre of films popular from the 1930s through the 1950s. The film was one of [[Universal Studios|Universal]]'s early horror productions and is considered \"the cornerstone of Universal's school of horror\".<ref name=\"Clarens\">Carlos Clarens, ''An Illustrated History of Horror and Science-Fiction Films: The Classic Era, 1895\u20131967'' (New York: Da Capo Press, 1997), p. 56, {{ISBN|0-306-80800-5}}.</ref> The play has been filmed five other times, [[The Cat and the Canary (1939 film)|most notably in 1939]], starring [[Bob Hope]] and [[Paulette Goddard]].\n\n== Plot ==\n<!-- Please help keep this section brief. Every detail about the plot does not need to appear here. -->\nIn a decaying mansion overlooking the [[Hudson River]], millionaire Cyrus West approaches death. His greedy family descends upon him like \"cats around a canary\", causing him to become [[Insanity|insane]]. West orders that his [[Will (law)|last will and testament]] remain locked in a safe and go unread until the 20th anniversary of his death. As the appointed time arrives, West's lawyer, Roger Crosby ([[Tully Marshall]]), discovers that a second will mysteriously appeared in the safe. The second will may only be opened if the terms of the first will are not fulfilled. The caretaker of the West mansion, Mammy Pleasant ([[Martha Mattox]]), blames the manifestation of the second will on the ghost of Cyrus West, a notion that the astonished Crosby quickly rejects.\n\nAs midnight approaches, West's relatives arrive at the mansion: nephews Harry Blythe ([[Arthur Edmund Carewe]]), Charles \"Charlie\" Wilder ([[Forrest Stanley]]), Paul Jones ([[Creighton Hale]]), his sister Susan Sillsby ([[Flora Finch]]) and her niece Cecily Young ([[Gertrude Astor]]), and niece Annabelle West ([[Laura La Plante]]). Cyrus West's fortune is bequeathed to the most distant relative bearing the name \"West\": Annabelle. The will, however, stipulates that to inherit the fortune, she must be judged sane by a doctor, Ira Lazar ([[Lucien Littlefield]]). If she is deemed insane, the fortune is passed to the person named in the second will. The fortune includes the West diamonds which her uncle hid years ago. Annabelle realizes that she is now like her uncle, \"in a cage surrounded by cats.\"\n\nWhile the family prepares for dinner, a guard ([[George Siegmann]]) barges in and announces that an escaped [[lunatic]] called the Cat is either in the house or on the grounds. The guard tells Cecily, \"He's a maniac who thinks he's a cat, and tears his victims like they were canaries!\" Meanwhile, Crosby suspects someone in the family might try to harm Annabelle and decides to inform her of her successor. Before he speaks the person's name, a hairy hand with long nails emerges from a secret passage in a bookshelf and pulls him in, terrifying Annabelle. When she explains what happened to Crosby, the family immediately concludes that she is insane.\n\nAlone in her assigned room, Annabelle examines a note slipped to her which reveals the location of the family jewels, fashioned into an elaborate necklace. She follows the note's instructions and soon discovers the hiding place, in a secret panel above the fireplace. She retires for the night, wearing the diamond-encrusted necklace.\n\n[[File:CatandtheCanaryHand.jpg|left|thumb|A hand reaches for the necklace worn by Annabelle West.]]\n\nWhile Annabelle sleeps, the same mysterious hand emerges from the wall behind her bed and snatches the diamonds from her neck. Once again, her sanity is questioned, but as Harry and Annabelle search the room, they discover a hidden passage in the wall and in it the corpse of Roger Crosby. Mammy Pleasant leaves to call the police, while Harry searches for the guard; Susan runs away in [[Hysteria|hysterics]] and hitches a ride with a milkman ([[Joe Murphy (actor)|Joe Murphy]]). Paul and Annabelle return to her room to search for the missing envelope, and discover that Crosby's body is missing. Paul vanishes as the secret passage closes behind him. Wandering in the hidden passages, Paul is attacked by the Cat and left for dead. He regains consciousness in time to rescue Annabelle. The police arrive and arrest the Cat, who is actually Charlie Wilder in disguise; the guard is his accomplice. Wilder is the person named in the second will; he had hoped to drive Annabelle insane so that he could receive the inheritance.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{Cast list|\n* [[Laura La Plante]] as Annabelle West\n* [[Creighton Hale]] as Paul Jones\n* [[Forrest Stanley]] as Charles Wilder\n* [[Tully Marshall]] as Roger Crosby\n* [[Gertrude Astor]] as Cecily\n* [[Flora Finch]] as Susan\n* [[Arthur Edmund Carewe]] as Harry\n* [[Martha Mattox]] as Mammy Pleasant, housekeeper\n* [[George Siegmann]] as the Guard\n* [[Lucien Littlefield]] as Dr. Ira Lazar\n* Hal Craig as Policeman\n* [[Billy Engle]] as Taxi Driver\n* [[Joe Murphy (actor)|Joe Murphy]] as Milkman\n}}\n\n== Production ==\n''The Cat and the Canary'' is the product of early 20th-century [[German Expressionism]]. According to art historian Joan Weinstein, expressionism includes the art styles of [[Die Br\u00fccke]] and [[Der Blaue Reiter]], [[cubism]], [[Futurism (art)|futurism]], and [[Abstract art|abstraction]]. The key element that connects these styles is the concern for the expression of inner feelings over [[verisimilitude]] to nature.<ref>Joan Weinstein, ''The End of Expressionism: Art and the November Revolution in Germany, 1918\u20131919'' (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1990), p. 3, {{ISBN|0-226-89059-7}}.</ref> Film historian Richard Peterson notes that \"[[Cinema of Germany|German cinema]] became famous for stories of psychological horror and for uncanny moods generated through lighting, set design and camera angles.\" Such filmmaking techniques drew on expressionist themes. Influential examples of German expressionist film include [[Robert Wiene]]'s ''[[The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari (1920 film)|The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari]]'' (1920) about a deranged doctor and Paul Leni's ''[[Waxworks (film)|Waxworks]]'' (1925) about a [[wax museum|wax figure display]] at a fair.<ref name=\"LinerNotes\">Richard Peterson, liner notes, ''The Cat and the Canary'' (DVD, Image Entertainment, 2005).</ref>\n\n''Waxworks'' impressed [[Carl Laemmle]], the German-born president of [[Universal Pictures]]. Laemmle was struck by Leni's departure from expressionism by the inclusion of humor and playfulness during grotesque scenes.<ref name=\"LinerNotes\" /> Meanwhile, in the United States, [[D. W. Griffith]]'s ''[[One Exciting Night]]'' (1922) began a [[Gothic fiction|Gothic horror]] film trend that Laemmle wanted to capitalize on; subsequent films in the genre like [[Alfred E. Green]]'s now lost ''[[The Ghost Breaker (1922 film)|The Ghost Breaker]]'' (1922), [[Frank Tuttle]]'s ''[[Puritan Passions]]'' (1923), [[Roland West]]'s ''[[The Monster (1925 film)|The Monster]]'' (1925) and ''[[The Bat (1926 film)|The Bat]]'' (1926), and [[Alfred Santell]]'s ''[[The Gorilla (1927 film)|The Gorilla]]'' (1927)\u2014all comedy horror film adaptations of [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] stage plays\u2014proved successful.<ref name=\"Neale95\">Steve Neale, ''Genre and Hollywood'' (London: Routledge, 2000), p. 95, {{ISBN|0-415-02606-7}}.</ref><ref>Ian Conrich, \"Before Sound: Universal, Silent Cinema, and the Last of the Horror Spectaculars\", in ''The Horror Film'', ed.

Willard hesitated in permitting Laemmle to film his play because, as historian Douglas Brode explains, \"that would have exposed to virtually everyone the trick ending, ... destroying the play's potential as an ongoing moneymaker.\" Nevertheless, Willard was convinced and the play was adapted into a screenplay by [[Alfred A. Cohn]] and [[Robert F. Hill]].<ref name=\"BrodeP32\">Douglas Brode, ''Edge of Your Seat: The 100 Greatest Movie Thrillers'' (New York: Citadel Press, 2003), p. 32, {{ISBN|0-8065-2382-4}}.</ref>\n\n=== Casting ===\n''The Cat and the Canary'' features veteran silent film stars [[Laura La Plante]], [[Creighton Hale]], and [[Forrest Stanley]]. According to film historian [[Gary Don Rhodes]], La Plante's part in ''The Cat and the Canary'' was typical for women in horror and mystery films: \"The female in the horror film ... becomes the hunted, the quarry. She has little to do, and so the question becomes 'What will be done ''with'' her?'\" Rhodes adds, \"The heroines are young and beautiful, but represent more a prize to be possessed\u2014whether \"stolen\" by a villain or \"owned\" by a young hero at the films' conclusions.\"<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oHApAwAAQBAJ |title=White Zombie.

Historian Bernard F. Dick observes that \"Leni reduced German expressionism, with its weird [[chiaroscuro]], asymmetric sets, and excessive stylization, to a format compatible with American film practice.\"<ref name=\"Dick56\" /> Jenn Dlugos argues that \"many stage play movie adaptations [of the 1920s] fall into the trap of looking like 'a stage play taped for the big screen' with minimal emphasis on the environment and plenty of stage play overacting.\"<ref>Jenn Dlugos, review of ''The Cat and the Canary'' DVD, at [http://classic-horror.com/reviews/catcanary27.shtml Classic-Horror]; last accessed January 4, 2007.</ref> This, however, was not the case for Leni's film. Richard Scheib notes that \"Leni's style is something that lifts ''The Cat and the Canary'' up and away from being merely a filmed stage play and gives it an amazing visual dynamism.\"<ref>Richard Scheib, review of ''The Cat and the Canary'', at [http://www.moria.co.nz/horror/cat&canary27.htm The SF, Horror and Fantasy Film Review] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061110005018/http://www.moria.co.nz/horror/cat%26canary27.htm |date=November 10, 2006 }}; last accessed January 4, 2007.</ref>\n\nLeni used similar camera effects found in German expressionist films such as ''The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari'' to set the atmosphere of ''The Cat and the Canary''. The film opens with a hand wiping cobwebs away to reveal the title credits. Other effects include \"dramatic shadows, portentous [[superimposition]]s and moody sequences in which the camera glides through corridors with billowing curtains.\"<ref name=\"LinerNotes\" /> Film historian Jan-Christopher Horak explains that a \"[[Film transition|matched dissolve]] from an image of the mansion and its oddly shaped towers to the oversized bottles of medicine that the dearly departed has been forced to consume functions as a double image of a prison, dwarfing the old man who sits alive with his will in a corner of the frame.\"<ref name=\"HorakP241\">Jan-Christopher Horak, \"Sauerkraut and Sausages with a Little Goulash: Germans in Hollywood, 1927.\" ''Film History'' 17 (2005): pp. 241.</ref> Leni worked with the cast to add to the mood created by lighting and camera angles. [[Cinematographer]] [[Gilbert Warrenton]] recalled that Leni used a [[gong]] to startle the actors. Warrenton mused, \"He beat that thing worse than the [[Salvation Army]] beat a drum.\"<ref>Gilbert Warrenton, quoted in Kevin Brownlow, \"Annus Mirabilis: The Film in 1927\", ''Film History'' 17 (2005): p. 173.</ref>\n\nWhile the film contains elements of horror, according to film historian Dennis L. White it \"is structured with an end other than horror in mind. Some scenes may achieve horror, and some characters dramatically experience horror, but for these films conventional clues and a logical explanation, at least an explanation plausible in hindsight, are usually crucial, and are of necessity their makers' first concern.\"<ref>Dennis L. White, \"The Poetics of Horror: More than Meets the Eye\", ''Cinema Journal'' 10 (No. 2, Spring 1971): p. 5.</ref>\n\nBesides directing, Leni was a painter and set designer. The sets of the film were designed by Leni and fabricated by [[Charles D. Hall]], who later designed the sets of ''[[Dracula (1931 English-language film)|Dracula]]'' (1931) and ''[[Frankenstein (1931 film)|Frankenstein]]'' (1931).<ref>John T.

He wrote, \"It is not extreme reality that the camera perceives, but the reality of the inner event, which is more profound, effective and moving than what we see through everyday eyes ....\"<ref name=\"LinerNotes\" /> Leni went on to direct the [[Charlie Chan]] film ''[[The Chinese Parrot (film)|The Chinese Parrot]]'' (1927), ''[[The Man Who Laughs (1928 film)|The Man Who Laughs]]'' (1928), and ''[[The Last Warning]]'' (1929) before his death in 1929 from [[Bacteremia|blood poisoning]].<ref>Graham Petrie, ''Hollywood Destinies: European Directors in America, 1922\u20131931'' (Detroit: Wayne State University Press, 2002), pp. 186\u2013189 {{ISBN|0-8143-2958-6}}.</ref>\n\n== Reception and influence ==\n[[File:CatandtheCanaryPoster.jpg|thumb|right|Theatrical poster emphasizing aspects of the film, particularly the \"cat and the canary\" and the mysterious, sinister hand]]\n\n''The Cat and the Canary'' debuted in New York City's Colony Theatre on September 9, 1927,<ref name=\"ReidP39\" /><ref>\"Projection Jottings\", ''New York Times'', May 15, 1927, p.
