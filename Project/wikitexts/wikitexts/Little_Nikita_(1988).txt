The film marks the first collaboration between Phoenix and Poitier (the second being ''[[Sneakers (1992 film)|Sneakers]]'' in 1992).\n\n==Plot==\nJeffrey Nicolas Grant ([[River Phoenix]]), a brash hyperactive [[high school]] student, lives in a [[San Diego]] suburb with his parents, who own a successful [[garden center]]. Keen to fly, he has applied for entry to the Air Force Academy.\n\nDuring a routine background check on Jeff, [[FBI]] agent Roy Parmenter (Poitier) finds evidence they may be [[sleeper agent]]s for the [[Soviet Union]]. Unable to arrest them as they have not done anything illegal, Roy continues his investigation, moves into the house across the street from the Grant family, and worms his way into their confidence.\n\nHe eventually confronts Jeff with his suspicions and seeks Jeff's cooperation to learn more about his parents. Initially unbelieving, Jeff is soon forced to accept the facts and discovers that even his name is fictitious and that his real name is Nikita.\n\nRoy confides to Jeff that twenty years earlier, his partner was killed by a Soviet agent, known only as 'Scuba' ([[Richard Lynch]]), and that he is still at large. 'Scuba' is now a rogue agent, killing [[KGB]] agents one by one, including \"sleepers\". Meanwhile, a Soviet spy-catcher, Konstantin Karpov ([[Richard Bradford (actor)|Richard Bradford]]), has been sent from the Soviet embassy in [[Mexico City]] to 'reel in' Scuba.\n\nJeff is captured and held as a hostage at gunpoint by Karpov, as he and 'Scuba' make their way to the Mexican border on the [[San Diego Trolley]]. Roy has also confronted them and is holding Karpov at gunpoint. At the border, the situation resolves itself; Karpov and 'Scuba' cross into Mexico, and the Grant family remain in the United States.\n\n==Cast==\n<!--- [[WP:NOTDATABASE]] - cast and order per opening stand-alone credits, roles per closing credits scroll --->\n* [[Sidney Poitier]] as Roy Parmenter\n* [[River Phoenix]] as Jeff Grant / Nikita\n* [[Richard Jenkins]] as Richard Grant\n* [[Caroline Kava]] as Elizabeth Grant\n* [[Richard Bradford (actor)|Richard Bradford]] as Konstantin Karpov\n* [[Loretta Devine]] as Verna McLaughlin\n* [[Richard Lynch (actor)|Richard Lynch]] as Scuba\n* [[Lucy Deakins]] as Barbara Kerry\n\nIn addition, the film co-starred [[Jerry Hardin]] as Brewer, [[Albert Fortell]] as Bunin, Ronald Guttnan as Spassky and [[Jacob Vargas]] as Miguel.\n\n==Reception==\nThe movie received mixed reviews and holds a \"Rotten\" score of 57% on [[Rotten Tomatoes]]. Walter Goodman said that Benjamin's directing strategy in the film \"seems to have been to paper over the holes in the plot with routine moves from spy shows past, in hopes of making the improbable passable.\"<ref>{{cite news|last=Goodman |first=Walter |url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=940DE0DD1530F93BA25750C0A96E948260 |title=Movie Review - Little Nikita - Review/Film; Poitier in 'Little Nikita' - NYTimes.com |publisher=Movies.nytimes.com |date=1988-03-18 |accessdate=2012-06-26}}</ref> [[Roger Ebert]] awarded the film one and a half stars, suspecting that Poitier and the makers of the film had no idea of how to use a computer, and that \"it turns all of the characters into chess pieces, whose relationships depend on the plot, not on human chemistry.
