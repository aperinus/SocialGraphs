It has since gone on to be considered a [[cult film]].\n\n==Synopsis==\nIn 1996 in [[Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin]], [[Mark Borchardt]] dreams of being a filmmaker. Currently however, he delivers papers for a living, is deeply indebted, still lives with his parents, is a borderline alcoholic, and is estranged from his ex-girlfriend, who is threatening to move out of state with their three children. He acknowledges his various failures, but aspires to one day make more of his life.\n\nHoping to jump-start his amateur filmmaking career, Mark restarts production on ''Northwestern'', a feature-length film he has been planning for most of his adult life. Initially, the project attracts some interest from the group of amateur actors with whom Mark has produced some radio plays, but by the fourth production meeting almost no one shows up and Mark is forced to acknowledge that he currently lacks the resources to move ''Northwestern'' past the pre-production phase.\n\nTo drum up the attention and financial resources needed to film ''Northwestern'', Mark decides to finally complete ''[[Coven (1997 film)|Coven]]'' (which Borchardt mispronounces with a long 'o'), a horror short that he began shooting on [[16 mm film]] in 1994, but ultimately abandoned. He receives financing from his Uncle Bill, a wise, but increasingly senile, eighty-two-year-old retiree who lives in a dilapidated trailer despite having $280,000 in his bank account. Bill hesitantly agrees to invest in ''Coven'', with the goal of selling three thousand [[VHS]] tapes, which Mark says will raise enough capital to finance ''Northwestern''.\n\nMark restarts production on ''Coven'', but suffers numerous mishaps. Although he is hard-working and knowledgeable about film making, he is also poor at planning ahead and inarticulate as a director. Additionally, he builds his production crew out of friends and neighbors, many of whom are incompetent at the tasks to which he assigns them. Particular attention is given to his best friend, guitarist [[Mike Schank]], an amiable recovering alcoholic and drug addict with [[Reduced affect display|reduced affect]] who is one of the most reliable members of the crew (and also recorded the music for the soundtrack of the documentary). In their adolescence, Mark and Mike bonded over their shared love of [[vodka]], but Mike is now sober and has joined [[Alcoholics Anonymous]], though he has become a [[compulsive gambling|compulsive gambler]], buying [[scratchcard|scratch-off]] lottery tickets from the gas station, sometimes accompanied by his AA sponsor, who then drives them both to Gamblers' Anonymous meetings; Mike reasons that, while you sometimes win and sometimes lose the lottery, you always lose with drugs and alcohol.\n\nAs the work on ''Coven'' moves forward, Mark faces the skepticism of his family and his own burgeoning alcoholism, though he does eventually wrap principal photography. At Thanksgiving dinner and, later, a family party to watch [[Super Bowl XXXI]], he gets drunk and becomes alternately agitated, cheery, and despondent. At one point, he wistfully watches footage he shot for ''Northwestern'' back in 1990 and contemplates whether or not he is a failure.\n\nAfter an extended post-production process during which Mark, and sometimes Mike and Mark's children, occasionally sleep in an editing room at [[University of Wisconsin\u2013Milwaukee]], Mark finally finishes work on ''Coven'' minutes before its premiere at a local theater in [[Milwaukee]] in summer of 1997. The screening sells out, and Mark's family and friends are happy that the project has finally been completed.\n\nIn the final scene, Mark goes to visit Uncle Bill and discusses the prospect of future fame and wealth and realizing the [[American Dream]]. Bill's response is a combination of rambling, cryptic, and poetic, but he seems to be advising Mark to focus on spiritual matters and bringing happiness into other people's lives. The closing text reveals that Bill died on September 13, 1997, and left Mark $50,000 in his will for the completion of ''Northwestern''.{{efn|Decades later, ''Northwestern'' remains uncompleted.}}\n\n==Reception==\nOn the [[Review aggregator|review aggregation]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film has an approval rating of 94% based on 49 reviews, with a [[weighted arithmetic mean|weighted average]] of 8.28/10; the site's consensus reads: \"Well worth watching for film buffs and anyone who believes in following your dreams, ''American Movie'' is a warm, funny, and engrossing ode to creative passion\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/american_movie/|title=American Movie (1999)|website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|access-date=July 3, 2019}}</ref> [[Janet Maslin]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote that the film conveys Borchardt's passion \"Insightfully and stirringly, not to mention hilariously\", and that \"For anyone wondering where the spirit of maverick independent filmmaking has its source, you need look no further\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9C07E3DA1E3BF936A35752C1A96F958260|title=FILM REVIEW; Seat-of-the Pants Director: Lights!
