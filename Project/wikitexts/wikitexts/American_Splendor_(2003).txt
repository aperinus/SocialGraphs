It's [[Halloween]] and an 11-year-old Harvey Pekar refuses to dress up as a [[superhero]] while trick-or-treating. The scene shifts to an adult, walking the gritty [[Cleveland]] streets. Then real [[Harvey Pekar]] appears in a documentary-style setup.\n\nThe narrative picks up again in 1975, as a scratchy-voiced Harvey visits a throat doctor and exhibits [[hypochondria]]. Harvey's wife decides their \"[[plebeian]]\" lifestyle just isn't working for her anymore; without being able to speak, Harvey is powerless to convince her not to leave him. A few months later, a depressed Harvey is at his file clerk job at the [[VA hospital]]. Mr. Boats comes by to offer advice: the words of an [[Elinor Wylie]] poem.\n\nIn a documentary scene, the real Harvey Pekar talks about his years as a part-time used-record collector/salesman. The narrative flashes back to 1962. While searching for old records at a yard sale, Harvey meets shy [[greeting card]] illustrator [[Robert Crumb]]. A friendship is formed over a shared love of [[jazz]] and [[comic books]].\n\nReturning to 1975, a now famous Crumb is back in Cleveland for a visit. His marriage over, Harvey is lonely and frustrated \u2014 he wants to leave a mark on the world. Afterward, a sobering moment in the VA hospital's \"deceased\" files section leads Harvey to try drawing his own stories, but his lack of drawing talent stops him. An incident at the supermarket revives him, as his animated subconscious goads him: \"Are you going to stand there in silence, or are you going to make a mark?\" Inspired, Harvey stays up all night writing. At a diner with Crumb, Harv makes a pitch for a new kind of comics. He shows Bob the scripts he's been working on, and Crumb offers to illustrate them for him.\n\nA montage of classic Pekar quotidian moments culminates with Harvey proudly showing off ''[[American Splendor]]'' #1 to his [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs|VA]] co-workers. The narrative moves forward to 1984. Harvey has published eight issues of ''American Splendor'' to critical acclaim but little financial gain; he's still a \"flunky file clerk.\" Harvey runs into Alice Quinn, a woman he briefly knew in college. They catch up on each other's lives and talk about [[Theodore Dreiser]]'s novel ''[[Jennie Gerhardt]]''. Harvey leaves their encounter feeling more alone than ever before.\n\nMeanwhile, in [[Delaware]], Joyce is frustrated with her partner in the comic book store, who has sold her copy of ''American Splendor'' #8 out from under her. She writes to Harvey, he responds, and they discover they are kindred spirits. Joyce travels to Cleveland to meet Harvey in person. The date begins with a handshake and dinner at a local family restaurant. Back at Harvey's apartment, Joyce is overcome with a bout of nausea and vomiting. A concerned Harvey offers her [[chamomile tea]]. Charmed, Joyce suggests they \"skip the whole courtship thing\" and get married.\n\nIt's one week later, and Harvey sees his VA colleague [[Toby Radloff]] sitting in his car eating [[White Castle (restaurant)|White Castle]] [[Slider (sandwich)|sliders]]. Toby is on his way to [[Toledo, Ohio|Toledo]] to see the new movie ''[[Revenge of the Nerds]]''. Meanwhile, Harvey is on his way to Delaware to marry Joyce and help her move out to Cleveland.\n\nSitting alongside the real Harvey, the real [[Joyce Brabner]] talks about what it was like to become a character in Harvey's stories.\n\nNow married, Harvey and Joyce go to a screening of ''Revenge of the Nerds'' with Toby. Joyce and Toby found the film inspiring, and Harvey found it insipid. Back at their apartment, Joyce struggles with feeling at home amidst all of Harvey's stuff. Their spat is interrupted by a message from a theater producer who wants to make ''American Splendor'' into a play. Harvey and Joyce travel to [[Los Angeles]] to see ''American Splendor: The Play''. Things are finally breaking Harvey's way. But his ascendancy is complicated by Joyce's emotional struggles. She wants a family. Her desires are put aside again because a producer calls to offer Harvey a chance to be a guest on ''[[Late Night with David Letterman]]''.\n\nAlmost despite himself, Harvey is a hit on the show and comes back for multiple appearances. Meanwhile, Toby becomes an [[MTV]] star. Back in Cleveland, a man recognizes Harvey from the Letterman show, but not for the \"right\" reasons. Harvey is angry and unfulfilled. Meanwhile, Joyce is looking for fulfillment of her own, as a creator and as an activist. Against Harvey's wishes, she goes away to a peace conference, leaving him at loose ends. One lonely night, Harvey discovers a mysterious lump on his groin.\n\nJoyce is still away on her mission, and a scared and bitter Harvey makes another appearance on the Letterman show. He dons an \"On Strike Against [[NBC]]\" shirt and the show goes downhill from there, winding up in chaos. Joyce finally returns, but she discovers Harvey's lump. Harvey is diagnosed with [[lymphoma]]. Joyce suggest he make a comic book of the whole thing, but Harvey just wants to die. Undeterred, Joyce enlists Fred, an artist, to illustrate the experience. Fred brings along his daughter Danielle on their first brainstorming session, and Joyce is smitten with the girl. Harvey reluctantly agrees to participate in the comic, and asks Fred to keep bringing Danielle along.\n\nHarvey's treatment is traumatic and tumultuous. One night, an addled Harvey wonders if he's real or if he is just a character in a comic book, and whether the story will end or continue if he dies. In one continuous take, Harvey wanders through a dreamscape, musing about other individuals he finds in the Cleveland telephone book that are also named Harvey Pekar.\n\nOne year later, Harvey and Joyce sign the completed ''[[Our Cancer Year]]''. Harvey is declared cancer-free. They adopt Danielle, and Harvey adjusts to being a parent. The real Harvey retires from the VA hospital, and the movie ends with a group hug.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Paul Giamatti]] as [[Harvey Pekar]]\n** [[Daniel Tay]] as young Harvey\n** [[Donal Logue]] as stage actor Harvey\n* [[Hope Davis]] as [[Joyce Brabner]]\n** [[Molly Shannon]] as stage actor Joyce\n* [[Judah Friedlander]] as [[Toby Radloff]]\n* [[James Urbaniak]] as [[Robert Crumb]]\n* [[Harvey Pekar]] as himself\n* [[Joyce Brabner]] as herself\n* [[Toby Radloff]] as himself\n* [[Earl Billings]] as Mr. Boats\n* Maggie Moore as Alice Quinn\n* [[James McCaffrey (actor)|James McCaffrey]] as Fred\n* [[Madylin Sweeten]] as Danielle\n* [[Gary Dumm]] (a long-time illustrator for ''[[American Splendor]]'') as The Extra (in a suede jacket), who asks Pekar for his autograph in the ''Our Cancer Year'' book-signing scene \n* [[Eytan Mirsky]] as The Guitarist\n* [[Josh Hutcherson]] as Kid dressed as [[Robin (comics)|Robin]] (his first feature film appearance)<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1242688/ Hutcherson entry] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190717103257/https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1242688/ |date=July 17, 2019 }}, Internet Movie Database.

We actually went to Cleveland and spent time with Harvey and Joyce, and spoke to them on the phone a lot. Once we spent some time with both of them, we were like, 'Oh my God, we have to put them in the movie!' That was a case where we were still using our documentary instincts and had to figure out a way to include him in it that was a natural fit for the material.\"<ref name=\"creativescreenwriting\"/>\n\nAt one point, Pekar meta-references the structure of the film by doing a voice-over for a one-shot of Paul Giamatti playing him by saying \"There's our guy. Well, it's me. Or the guy playing me. Though he don't look nothing like me, but whatever.\" (Pekar and Brabner had been approached previously by actors interested in playing Pekar on film, including [[Rob Schneider]].)<ref>Morrow, Fiona.
