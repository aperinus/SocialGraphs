The supporting cast features [[Hank Azaria]], [[Janeane Garofalo]], [[Cloris Leachman]], and [[Bonnie Hunt]], among many others. The plot follows four women who recount a pivotal summer they shared together as adolescents in 1970.\n\nIt was filmed largely in the Country Walk subdivision off Coffee Bluff Road in [[Savannah, Georgia]] (called Shelby, Indiana in the movie), using the Gaslight Addition and Old Town Cemetery, highlighting the downtown area. Additional filming was done in [[Statesboro, Georgia]] in locations including the Bulloch County Court House (also featured in the film ''[[1969 (film)|1969]]'') and the building now housing the Averitt Center for the Arts.\n\nThough the film received unfavorable reviews upon release, it was a box office success, grossing $37.5 million against a $12 million budget. The film is considered a [[Cult following|cult classic]] for its depiction of girlhood and centering of female friendships.<ref name=NYT/>\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1995, four women and childhood friends reunite in their hometown of [[Shelby, Indiana]]. They include sci-fi author Samantha Albertson, glitzy actress Tina \"Teeny\" Tercell, dry-humored gynecologist Dr. Roberta Martin, and content homemaker Chrissy DeWitt, who is heavily pregnant and expecting to give birth to her first child any day.\n\nThe story flashes back to 1970 as Samantha recounts the memorable summer shared by them as young adolescents. Twelve-year-old Samantha seeks to earn enough money to purchase a [[tree house]] to place in Chrissy's backyard in their affluent suburban neighborhood, the Gaslight Addition.\n\nEach of the four girls is going through her own individual struggles. Samantha\u2019s parents are in the midst of a divorce, Teeny is in pursuit of stardom and is boy-crazy, tomboy Roberta experiences embarrassment due to her developing [[breast]]s, and Chrissy is naive about sex and life in general due to her mother's overprotectiveness.\n\nMotivated by Samantha's interest in the occult, the girls regularly sneak out at night to hold seances in the cemetery. During one, a cracked tombstone convinces them they have resurrected the spirit of a young boy identified only as Dear Johnny, who died in 1945. This sets the girls on a quest to find out what happened to him.\n\nAt a library in a nearby town, Roberta discovers an article about her mother\u2019s death due to a car accident: she was hit head on, trapped in her car for an hour, and then later died of massive head trauma and internal bleeding\u2014facts previously unknown to her. Samantha finds an obituary that briefly mentions Johnny and his mother tragically dying, but many of the pages are missing, leaving their cause of their deaths a mystery.\n\nMeanwhile, the girls get into all sorts of other adventures, including an ongoing prank war with a group of neighborhood boys called the Wormer brothers and a fight at a softball game after a local boy insults Roberta. Roberta has her first kiss with Scott Wormer and makes him swear not to tell anyone.\n\nOne night after some tension prompted by her mother dating someone new, Samantha storms out of her home. She and Teeny hang out in the tree house display at the store, where Samantha confides her parents are getting a divorce. Teeny comforts her and breaks her favorite necklace in two, giving one half to Samantha as a \"best friends for life\" bracelet.\n\nA thunderstorm breaks out as the girls head home, and Samantha accidentally drops her bracelet in a storm drain. She nearly drowns trying to retrieve it, but is rescued by Crazy Pete, a local old man who only comes out at night to ride his bike. This causes the girls to change their impression of Crazy Pete, who admits he only goes out at night because he prefers not to be around people.\n\nLater, at Samantha\u2019s grandmother\u2019s, as she refuses to tell them what happened to Johnny, they sneak into the attic. They discover old newspapers that reveal Jonathan Sims and his mother, Beverly Anne, were shot and killed when they interrupted a burglary; father and husband, Peter, came home to find their bodies.\n\nRoberta becomes upset and angry that two innocent people were killed and that her mother died violently, contrary to what she was told. Samantha tells them her parents are divorcing, and the girls make a pact to always be there for one another.\n\nThey go to the cemetery to perform one last seance to put Dear Johnny's soul to rest. His tombstone suddenly rises surrounded by bright light and a figure appears from behind. It turns out to just be the groundskeeper, who chastises the girls for \"playing\" in the cemetery and explains the damaged tombstone is being replaced because he was the one who cracked it. Chrissy then refuses to participate in future seances, deeming them a waste of time. The entire ordeal prompts Samantha to realize her childhood is coming to an end.\n\nWhile leaving, Samantha notices Crazy Pete going to the tombstone. Realizing he is Peter, she comforts him, while he advises her not to dwell on things. Some time after, the tree house is finally bought, and Samantha narrates, \"The treehouse was supposed to bring us more independence. But what the summer actually brought was independence from each other.\"\n\nThe film returns to 1995, where Chrissy goes into labor and gives birth to a baby girl. Later, in their old tree house, Roberta reveals that Crazy Pete died the previous year and Samantha confesses Pete was Dear Johnny's father. The friends reaffirm their pact and vow to remain close.\n\n==Cast==\n\n===Main characters===\n* '''Samantha Albertson''' ([[Gaby Hoffmann]]/[[Demi Moore]]) narrates the film. She believes in the paranormal and conducts the seances in the cemetery with her friends, who for the most part believe it to be all pretend. From the outside, her home life appears normal with her parents and younger sister, Angela. However, her parents had been having marital issues for some time now, much to the point that it had reached a level of consistency that never seemed to bother her. However, this came to an abrupt change when one night, her father moves out, and within a few weeks she learns her mother is seeing another man named Bud Kent. As an adult, she is a popular science-fiction author who has commitment issues. At age 12, she was the most invested in the mystery of Dear Johnny, whose spirit the girls believe they have resurrected from his tombstone. She alone learns the truth behind his death, and receives valuable advice that later helps her come to terms with her current struggles in life.\n* '''Roberta Martin''' ([[Christina Ricci]]/[[Rosie O'Donnell]]) is the proclaimed tomboy of the girls, stemming primarily from her upbringing in a family consisting of her father and three older brothers, her mother having been killed in a car accident when she was four. She tapes her breasts to flatten them, plays sports, and never hesitates to fight a boy. She usually leads the girls in their rivalry with the Wormer brothers, but eventually shares a kiss with Scott. Afterward, she no longer tapes her breasts, indicating that she accepts that she is growing into a woman. Her struggle to come to terms with her mother's death is highlighted in the film when she fakes her own death before her friends by pretending to have drowned while they were swimming, as well as in another instance in which Samantha recalls her having jumped off the roof and pretended to have broken her neck earlier that summer. As an adult, she is an [[obstetrician]] and lives with her boyfriend. At the end of the film, she delivers Chrissy's baby. Although it is never shown or mentioned who her boyfriend is the film hints that it might be Scott.\n* '''Chrissy DeWitt''' ([[Ashleigh Aston Moore]]/[[Rita Wilson]]) was raised by an overbearing, fastidious mother ([[Bonnie Hunt]]) who sheltered her. Her naivete, particularly about all things sexual, is often laughed at by her friends. She is the \"good girl\", who chastises the others for cussing (as children and adults). Being the most responsible, she closely monitors the \"tree house money\" they are saving. She always questions the others' schemes, but is fiercely loyal to them.  As an adult, she marries the nerdy Morton Williams, and they live in her childhood home and later have a baby girl. The pending birth of her first child brings Samantha and Teeny back to their hometown.\n* '''Tina \"Teeny\" Tercell''' ([[Thora Birch]]/[[Melanie Griffith]]) lives with her rich country club parents who are rarely around, which according to Samantha's narration is, \"a typical upbringing for actors and pathological liars\". She loves glamour, dressing up, and using makeup, and watches the films at the drive-in movie from her rooftop. Among the girls, she is the most interested in sexuality and boys and often flirts. She desires a bigger bust, and has breast implants when she's an adult. She is now a successful actress and has had multiple marriages. The limousine she arrives in is later used to transport Chrissy to the hospital when she goes into labor.\n\n===Supporting===\n{{Div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Devon Sawa]] as Scott Wormer, one of the Wormer brothers who bullies the girls but later reforms and shares a kiss with Roberta.\n* [[Lolita Davidovich]] as Mrs. Albertson, mother of Samantha and Angela who recently got divorced and gets a new boyfriend, Bud Kent.\n* [[Rumer Willis]] as Angela Albertson (credited as Willa Glen), sister of Samantha who misses her father dearly but takes a quick liking to her mother's new boyfriend, Bud Kent.\n* [[Cloris Leachman]] as Grandma Albertson, mother of Mr. Albertson and grandmother of Samantha and Angela.
