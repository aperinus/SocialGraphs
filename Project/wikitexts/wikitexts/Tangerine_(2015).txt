The story follows a [[transgender]] [[Prostitution|sex worker]] who discovers her boyfriend and [[Procuring (prostitution)|pimp]] has been cheating on her. The film was shot with three [[iPhone 5S]] smartphones.<ref name=\"nash\">[http://www.nashvillescene.com/nashville/beyond-using-progressive-filming-techniques-and-casting-tangerine-is-expressive-and-warm/Content?oid=5381312 \"Beyond using progressive filming techniques and casting, Tangerine is expressive and warm\"]. ''Nashville Scene'', By Jason Shawhan</ref>\n\n''Tangerine'' premiered at the [[2015 Sundance Film Festival]] on January 23, 2015. It had a [[limited release]] on July 10, 2015, through [[Magnolia Pictures]].<ref name=\"cweekly\" /> It received critical acclaim for its screenplay, direction, performances and portrayal of transgender individuals.\n\n== Plot ==\n[[Transgender sex worker]] Sin-Dee Rella, who has just finished a 28-day jail sentence, meets her friend Alexandra, another trans sex worker, at a donut shop in [[Hollywood, Los Angeles|Hollywood]] on Christmas Eve. Alexandra reveals that Sin-Dee's boyfriend and [[Procuring (prostitution)|pimp]] Chester has been cheating on her with a [[cisgender]] woman. Sin-Dee storms out to search the neighborhood for Chester and the woman.\n\nAlexandra hands out flyers for her musical performance that evening, and argues with a client who refuses to pay; their argument is broken up by the police. Razmik, an Armenian cab driver, picks up a prostitute, but ejects her from his cab when he discovers she is not transgender. He meets Alexandra and fellates her in a car wash, then goes home to eat Christmas dinner with his family. Alexandra goes to the bar for her performance, but no customers have arrived.\n\nSin-Dee finds the woman she is looking for, Dinah, at a brothel in a motel. She hauls her onto a bus to find Chester. Dinah taunts her for believing she is Chester's only girlfriend. Sin-Dee realizes she is late for Alexandra's performance and drags Dinah there instead. She reconciles with Dinah as they smoke [[Methamphetamine|crystal meth]] in the bar bathroom, and Sin-Dee applies Dinah's make-up. Alexandra performs to a mostly empty bar.\n\nRazmik leaves his family to attend Alexandra's performance, saying he has to work, but discovers he is too late and searches for Sin-Dee. Suspicious, his mother-in-law, Ashken, hails another Armenian cab driver, Karo. The driver knows about Razmik's interests, and while initially hesitant, Karo agrees to help her track down Razmik.\n\nSin-Dee, Alexandra and Dinah go to the donut shop, where Sin-Dee confronts Chester. He insists Dinah means nothing to him and reveals that he and Sin-Dee are engaged. Razmik arrives to solicit Sin-Dee, but he is followed by his mother-in-law. Ashken at first thinks Razmik's secret is that he is smoking marijuana, but Chester accidentally explains that he only has sex with prostitutes. She calls Razmik's wife, who arrives with their infant daughter. An argument between the eight escalates until the shop owner kicks them out. Razmik's wife is upset, but she tells her mother to mind her own business. He and his family go back to their apartment. Dinah walks back to the brothel but is told there is no room for her.\n\nOutside the donut shop, Chester tells Sin-Dee that he also slept with Alexandra. Hurt, Sin-Dee leaves and tries to pick up some clients; they throw urine in her face and drive away shouting [[Transphobia|transphobic]] slurs. Alexandra takes Sin-Dee to a laundromat to clean her clothes and wig, and gives her her own wig to wear while they wait.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Kitana Kiki Rodriguez]] as Sin-Dee Rella, Transgender Sex Worker\n* [[Mya Taylor]] as Alexandra, Transgender Sex Worker\n* [[James Ransone]] as Chester, Drug Dealer and Pimp\n* [[Mickey O'Hagan]] as Dinah, Sex Worker\n* Karren Karagulian as Razmik, Armenian Cab Driver\n* Richard-Lael Lillard as Miss Willy\n* [[Alla Tumanian]] as Ashken, Razmik's Mother-In-law\n* [[Louisa Nersisyan]] as Yeva, Razmik's Wife\n* [[Arsen Grigoryan (singer, born 1982)|Arsen Grigoryan]] as Karo, Armenian Cab Driver\n* Ian Edwards as Nash\n* [[Scott Krinsky]] as Parsimonious John\n* [[Clu Gulager]] as The Cherokee, Fare In Razmik's Cab\n* [[Josh Sussman]] as Retch Chunder\n* Ana Foxxx as Selena\n* Chelcie Lynn as Madam Jillian\n* [[Jason Stuart]] as Joey, The Doorman\n* Katja Kassin as John's Prostitute\n* [[Shih-Ching Tsou]] as Mamasan, Mananger of Donut Time\n* Julie Cummings as Officer Jules\n* Rae L.
