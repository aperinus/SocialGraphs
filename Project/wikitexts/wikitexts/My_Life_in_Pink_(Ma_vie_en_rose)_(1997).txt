It tells the story of Ludovic, a [[transgender girl]], and depicts her family and community struggling to accept her [[gender identity]].\n\nThe film received largely positive reviews and was selected as the Belgian entry for the [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film|Best Foreign Language Film]] at the [[70th Academy Awards]], but was not accepted as a nominee.<ref>Margaret Herrick Library, Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences</ref><ref name=\"70thSubmissions\">{{cite web|title=44 Countries Hoping for Oscar Nominations |publisher=[[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] |date=24 November 1997 |url=//www.oscars.org/pressreleases/97.11.24.html |access-date=13 October 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19980213090309/http://www.oscars.org/pressreleases/97.11.24.html |archive-date=13 February 1998 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nPierre and Hanna Fabre move into their dream house with wonderful neighbors and an idyllic community. Their youngest child, Ludovic, identifies as a girl and wants to live as one, despite being assigned male.\n\nOne day, Ludovic befriends J\u00e9r\u00f4me, the son of Pierre's boss whose family lives across from the Fabres, and expresses a desire to marry him. When visiting J\u00e9r\u00f4me's house, Ludovic enters J\u00e9r\u00f4me's sister's bedroom and puts on one of her dresses, unaware that his parents were preserving the room after her death. J\u00e9r\u00f4me's mother finds Ludovic, and she and the rest of the neighbors are horrified.\n\nThe community turns against Ludovic and, by extension, the rest of the Fabre family. After Ludovic stands in as [[Snow White]] in a school play, the rest of the parents collectively sign a petition to have Ludovic expelled. Pierre, under strain as an employee of J\u00e9r\u00f4me's father, is unable to cope and causes conflict within the family. Ludovic is assaulted by the boys on the soccer team in the locker room after a match. Her brother Jean tries to stop it, but is held back.\n\nFollowing a particularly bad argument, Ludovic attempts [[suicide]] by hiding in a freezer, but is found in time and allowed to wear a skirt to a neighborhood party. While the other neighbors greet Ludo warmly, Pierre is fired the next day and finds his house graffitied. Ludovic flees, distraught. Hanna blames Ludovic for all that has gone wrong. In order to set her child straight, she cuts Ludovic's hair short. Resentful of her mother, Ludovic goes to live with grandmother \u00c9lisabeth. When Ludovic and \u00c9lisabeth visit Pierre and Hanna one weekend, Pierre announces that he has a new job, but it is out of town and they have to move.\n\nAt their new house, Ludovic is befriended by Chris (born Christine) Delvigne, a masculine child. Chris' mother invites Ludovic to Chris' dress-up birthday party, which Ludo attends in a musketeer outfit. Chris, unhappy in a princess outfit, asks Ludo to swap and has the other young party guests force Ludo to do so upon refusal. When Ludovic's mother sees them, she fears that their troubles are beginning again and lashes out by hitting Ludo until the other party guests restrain her.\n\nHanna follows Ludovic to a billboard where she is shocked to see Ludo in the picture, running away with Pam, the [[Barbie]]-like protagonist. When she tries to follow her, she falls through the ground and awakens at home. She and Pierre assure Ludo that they will no longer try to control her gender expression. In turn, Ludo assures her mother that she never really intended to run away with Pam. Hanna, happy to see her, accepts Ludo's identity and says Ludo will always be her child.\n\n==Cast==\n{{columns-list|colwidth=20em|\n* {{Interlanguage link multi|Georges Du Fresne|fr}} as Ludovic \"Ludo\" Fabre\n* [[Mich\u00e8le Laroque]] as Hanna Fabre\n* [[Jean-Philippe \u00c9coffey]] as Pierre Fabre\n* [[H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Vincent]] as \u00c9lisabeth\n* {{Interlanguage link multi|Daniel Hanssens|fr}} as Albert\n* {{Interlanguage link multi|Laurence Bibot|fr}} as Lisette\n* {{Interlanguage link multi|Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Gallotte|fr}} as Jeannot\n* Julien Rivi\u00e8re as J\u00e9r\u00f4me\n* Gregory Diallo as Thom Fabre\n* Erik Cazals De Fabel as Jean Fabre\n* Cristine Barget as Zo\u00e9 Fabre\n* Delphine Cadet as Pam\n* Raphaelle Santini as Christine \"Chris\" Delvigne\n* {{Interlanguage link multi|Marine Jolivet|fr}} as Fabienne Delvigne\n* [[Anne Coesens]] as Teacher\n* [[Vincent Grass]] as Principal\n}}\n\n==Production==\nAlthough internationally presented as a [[Cinema of Belgium|Belgian film]] because of the nationality of Berliner, its director and co-screenwriter, the film is an [[international co-production]] between companies in Belgium, the United Kingdom and France \u2013 the majority of the production work was done by the French [[independent film]] house Haut et Court and the shooting took place south of Paris, France, near the commune of [[\u00c9vry, Essonne|\u00c9vry]].\n\nThe [[color timing]] in the film is significant: it changes as parents exit from the school play, switching to cold blue tones.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\n==Release==\nIn the United States, the film received an [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system#Ratings|R rating]] by the [[Motion Picture Association of America]], an unusual decision due to the film's minimal sexual content, minimal violence and mild language.
