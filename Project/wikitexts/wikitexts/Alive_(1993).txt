One of the survivors, [[Nando Parrado]] (portrayed by Hawke in the film), served as the technical advisor for the film.\n\n== Plot ==\nThe film opens with a group of photographs of the [[Stella Maris College (Montevideo)|Stella Maris College]]'s [[Old Christians Club|Old Christians Rugby Team]]. [[Carlitos P\u00e1ez]] points out several members of the team and reflects on the accident in a brief monologue.\n\n[[Uruguayan Air Force Flight 571]] flies over the [[Andes]] on October 13, 1972. The raucous rugby players and a few of their relatives and friends are eagerly looking forward to an upcoming match in Chile.\n\nUpon emerging from clouds, the plane encounters turbulence and collides with a mountain. The wings and tail are separated from the fuselage, which slides down a mountain slope before coming to a stop. Six passengers and one flight attendant are ejected from the plane and die. Antonio, the team captain, coordinates efforts to help the injured. [[Roberto Canessa]] and [[Gustavo Zerbino]], both medical students, aid the injured. Another six passengers soon die, including both pilots and Nando's mother, Eugenia. Nando, who sustained a head injury, falls into a coma, and his sister Susana has suffered harsh internal injuries.\n\nAs the sun sets, the survivors make preparations for the night. Canessa discovers that the seat covers can be unzipped and used as blankets. The survivors go inside the fuselage and curl up beside one another to stay warm. Antonio, [[Roy Harley]], and Rafael Cano plug the gaping hole at the end of the fuselage with luggage to keep out the wind. Two passengers die overnight. With nothing to hunt or gather on the mountain, Antonio declares they will use rationing when the survivors find a tin of chocolates and a case of wine. After seeing a plane fly past, they think it dipped its wings, and the survivors celebrate. Expecting to be rescued the next day, everyone except Javier, his wife Liliana, and Antonio eat the remaining chocolates. This causes a quarrel among Antonio and several others.\n\nNando regains consciousness. After learning of his mother's death, Nando watches over Susana vigilantly. Knowing she will die of her injuries within a few days, he vows to set off on foot and find a way out of the mountains. When Carlitos reminds him that he will need food, Nando suggests eating the flesh of the deceased pilots to give him the strength to survive the journey to find help. Susana dies from her injuries. The survivors listen to a radio for word of their rescue but are devastated to hear the search called off after nine days.\n\nAfter great debate, the starving passengers decide to eat the flesh of their dead relatives and friends. Zerbino, Rafael, and Juan Martino set off to search for the tail of the plane in hopes of finding batteries for the plane's radio to transmit their location. Among pieces of the wreckage, the teammates find additional corpses, but return to the group with news that the tail of the plane is likely a little farther away. Later in the week, an avalanche strikes the plane and fills much of the interior with snow. Eight of the survivors, including Antonio and Liliana, are smothered to death by the snow. The remaining 19 survivors are forced to stay inside the plane when they realize there is a blizzard outside.\n\nA second team, made up of Nando, Canessa, and [[Antonio Vizintin|Antonio \"Tintin\" Vizintin]], sets out and find the tail of the plane. Unable to bring the batteries to the fuselage, they return to the fuselage to get Roy, who is thought to have experience with electrical equipment. They bring him to the tail of the plane to see if he could fix the radio. When Roy is unsuccessful, the team decides to return to the fuselage.\n\nFederico and Alberto die from their injuries, as does Rafael, leading Nando to convince a reluctant Canessa to search for a way out of the mountains, taking Tintin with them. Two days into the journey, they send Tintin back to the fuselage so they can appropriate his rations and continue on their own. After a 12-day trek, the two escape the mountains and alert the authorities to their companions' location. Two helicopters, one of which have Nando and Canessa onboard, appear overhead of the survivors on the mountain, leading the remaining 14 survivors to celebrate their impending rescue.\n\nIn the present, Carlitos describes how the survivors later returned to the site of the crash and buried the corpses under a pile of stones, marked with a cross. The memorial to the 29 deceased and 16 survivors is shown.\n\n== Cast ==\nThe film opens with a monologue by an older Carlitos Paez played by John Malkovich (uncredited). The names of the people who died in the disaster were changed for the film. There were three key exceptions: Eugenia and Susana Parrado ([[Nando Parrado]]'s mother and sister, respectively), and Liliana Methol ([[Javier Methol]]'s wife).\n\n=== Survivors ===\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Ethan Hawke]] as [[Nando Parrado]]\n* [[Josh Hamilton (actor)|Josh Hamilton]] as [[Roberto Canessa]]\n* [[John Haymes Newton]] as Antonio \"Tintin\" Vizintin\n* [[Bruce Ramsay]] (elder one: [[John Malkovich]]) as [[Carlos P\u00e1ez Rodr\u00edguez|Carlitos P\u00e1ez]]\n* David Kriegel as Gustavo Zerbino\n* [[Jack Noseworthy]] as Bobby Francois\n* Kevin Breznahan as Roy Harley\n* [[David Cubitt]] as Adolfo \"Fito\" Strauch\n* Gian DiDonna as Eduardo Strauch\n* [[John Cassini]] as Daniel Fern\u00e1ndez\n* [[Richard Ian Cox]] as Ram\u00f3n \"Moncho\" Sabella\n* Nuno Antunes as \u00c1lvaro Mangino\n* [[Gordon Currie (actor)|Gordon Currie]] as Jos\u00e9 Luis \"Coche\" Inciarte\n* [[Sam Behrens]] as Javier Methol\n* Michael Tayles as Alfredo Delgado\n* Steven Shayler as Jos\u00e9 Pedro Algorta\n}}\n\n=== Deceased ===\n{{Cast listing|\n* Michael Sicoly as the Pilot (Col.

He praised the \"first-rate cast\" and cinematography. Yet he wrote: \"There are some stories you simply can't tell.
