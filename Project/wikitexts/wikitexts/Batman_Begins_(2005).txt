Goyer]]. The film is based on the [[DC Comics]] character [[Batman]], it stars [[Christian Bale]] as [[Bruce Wayne (Dark Knight trilogy)|Bruce Wayne / Batman]], with [[Michael Caine]], [[Liam Neeson]], [[Katie Holmes]], [[Gary Oldman]], [[Cillian Murphy]], [[Tom Wilkinson]], [[Rutger Hauer]], [[Ken Watanabe]], and [[Morgan Freeman]] in supporting roles. The film [[reboot (fiction)|reboots]] the [[Batman in film|''Batman'' film series]], telling the [[origin story]] of [[Bruce Wayne (The Dark Knight trilogy)|Bruce Wayne]] from the death of his parents to his journey to become Batman and his fight to stop [[Ra's al Ghul]] and the [[Scarecrow (DC Comics)|Scarecrow]] from plunging [[Gotham City]] into chaos.\n\nAfter [[Batman & Robin (film)|''Batman & Robin'']] was panned by critics and underperformed at the box office, Warner Bros. Pictures cancelled future ''Batman'' films, including [[Joel Schumacher]]'s planned ''[[Batman in film#Batman Unchained|Batman Unchained]].'' Between 1998 and 2003, several filmmakers collaborated with Warner Bros. in attempting to [[Reboot (fiction)|reboot]] the franchise. After the studio rejected a ''Batman'' origin story reboot [[Joss Whedon]] pitched in December 2002, Warner Bros. hired Nolan in January 2003 to direct a new film as Nolan and Goyer began development on the film in early 2003. Aiming for a darker, more realistic tone compared to the previous films, a primary goal for their vision was to engage the audience's emotional investment in both the Batman and Bruce Wayne identities of the lead character. The film, which was principally shot in the United Kingdom, Iceland and Chicago, relied heavily on traditional [[stunt]]s and [[miniature effect]]s, with [[computer-generated imagery]] being used in a minimal capacity compared to other action films. Comic book storylines such as ''[[The Man Who Falls]]'', ''[[Batman: Year One]]'' and ''[[Batman: The Long Halloween]]'' served as inspiration.\n\nExpectations for ''Batman Begins'' ranged from moderate to low, which originated from the poor reception of ''Batman & Robin'' that was credited with stalling the ''Batman'' film series in 1997. After premiering in Tokyo on May 31, 2005, the film was released on June 15, 2005. It received highly positive reviews from critics, who deemed the film an improvement over the Schumacher films, with praise aimed at the more mature tone and character-driven storyline, Bale's performance, musical score, direction, the deeper psychological focus and added layers of depth to the titular character's motives and the emotional weight compared to previous Batman films. The film grossed over $371.9 million worldwide, becoming [[2005 in film|the ninth-highest-grossing film of 2005]] and was the second highest grossing ''Batman'' film at the time behind [[Tim Burton]]'s [[Batman (1989 film)|''Batman'' (1989)]]. Receiving a nomination for the [[Academy Award for Best Cinematography]], the film elevated Bale to leading man status while it made Nolan a high-profile director.\n\nSince its release, ''Batman Begins'' has been critically reassessed and it has been considered to be one of the best superhero films ever made, one of the best ''Batman'' films ever made, and has often been cited as one of the most influential films of the 2000s. It was credited for revitalizing the Batman character in popular culture, shifting its tone towards a darker and more serious tone and style. The film helped popularized the term reboot in Hollywood, inspiring studios and filmmakers to revive franchises with realistic and serious tones. It was followed by ''[[The Dark Knight]]'' (2008) and ''[[The Dark Knight Rises]]'' (2012), with the three films constituting ''[[The Dark Knight Trilogy]]''.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FilmPlot, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 and 700 words. -->\nIn [[Gotham City]], a young [[Bruce Wayne (The Dark Knight trilogy)|Bruce Wayne]] falls down a dry well and is attacked by a swarm of bats, developing a [[chiroptophobia|fear of them]]. Attending the opera with his parents, [[Thomas Wayne|Thomas]] and [[Martha Wayne|Martha]], Bruce becomes frightened by performers masquerading as bats and asks to leave. Outside, mugger [[Joe Chill]] murders Bruce's parents in front of him, and the orphaned Bruce is raised by the family butler, [[Alfred Pennyworth]]. 14 years later, Chill is paroled after testifying against mafia boss [[Carmine Falcone]]. Bruce intends to murder Chill to avenge his parents, but one of Falcone's assassins does so first. Bruce's childhood friend [[Rachel Dawes]] berates him for acting outside the justice system, saying that his father would be ashamed. After confronting Falcone, who tells him that real power comes from being feared, Bruce spends the next seven years traveling the world training in combat and immersing himself in the criminal underworld.\n\nIn a [[Bhutan]] prison, he meets Henri Ducard, who recruits him to the [[League of Assassins|League of Shadows]] led by [[Ra's al Ghul]]. After completing his training in ninja methods and purging his fears, Bruce learns that the League knows about Gotham and, believing the city is beyond saving, intends to destroy it. Bruce rejects the League and its edict that killing is necessary, burning down their temple during his escape. Ra's is killed by falling debris, while Bruce saves the unconscious Ducard. Returning to Gotham intent on fighting crime, Bruce takes an interest in his family's company, [[Wayne Enterprises]], which is being taken public by the unscrupulous William Earle. Company archivist [[Lucius Fox]], a friend of Bruce's father, allows Bruce access to prototype defense technologies, including a protective bodysuit and a heavily armored vehicle called a [[Batmobile|Tumbler]]. Bruce poses publicly as a shallow [[Playboy (lifestyle)|playboy]], even to Rachel for a moment; while setting up a base in the [[Batcave|caves]] beneath [[Wayne Manor]] and taking up the [[vigilante]] identity of \"[[Batman]]\", inspired by his childhood fear, which he has now conquered.\n\nIntercepting a drug shipment, Batman provides Rachel, now a Gotham Assistant District Attorney, with evidence against Falcone and enlists Sergeant [[James Gordon (comics)|James Gordon]], one of Gotham's few honest cops, to arrest him. In prison, Falcone meets [[Scarecrow (DC Comics)|Dr. Jonathan Crane]], a corrupt psychologist whom he has helped smuggle drugs into Gotham. Donning a scarecrow mask, Crane sprays Falcone with a [[Scarecrow (DC Comics)#Fear gas|fear-inducing hallucinogen]] which drives him insane, and has him transferred to [[Arkham Asylum]]. While investigating his crimes, Batman is sprayed with the hallucinogen and set on fire by Crane but manages to escape and is saved by Alfred, who gives him an antidote for the hallucinogen developed by Fox. When Rachel accuses Crane of corruption, he reveals to her that he has introduced his drug into Gotham's water supply. Crane then drugs Rachel with the hallucinogen, but Batman subdues him and sprays Crane with his own chemical to interrogate him, where Crane claims to work for Ra's al Ghul.\n\nBatman evades the police by attracting a large horde of bats using a high-pitched sound, to get Rachel to safety, administering her the antidote and giving her a vial of it for Gordon and another for mass production. At Bruce's birthday party, Ducard reappears and reveals himself to be the true Ra's al Ghul; the dead Ra's was a decoy. Having stolen a powerful microwave emitter from Wayne Enterprises, he plans to vaporize Gotham's water supply, rendering Crane's drug airborne and causing mass hysteria that will destroy the city. He sets Wayne Manor aflame and leaves Bruce to die, but Alfred rescues him. Ra's loads the microwave emitter onto Gotham's [[monorail]] system to release the drug at the city's central water source. Batman rescues Rachel from a drugged mob and indirectly reveals his identity to her. Confronting Ra's on the monorail, as Gordon uses the Tumbler's cannons to destroy a section of the track, Batman refuses to kill Ra's but chooses not to save him, gliding from the train as it crashes, killing Ra's.\n\nBruce gains Rachel's respect and love, but she decides she cannot be with him now, telling him if Gotham should no longer need Batman, they can be together. Batman becomes a public hero and Bruce reveals he has purchased a controlling stake in Wayne Enterprises, firing Earle and replacing him with Fox. Sergeant Gordon is promoted to Lieutenant, shows Batman the [[Bat-Signal]], and tells him about a criminal who leaves behind [[Joker (playing card)|Joker playing cards]].{{efn|Identified off-screen as the [[Joker (The Dark Knight)|Joker]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Moore |first1=Trent |title=Nolan explains how Batman Begins wasn't meant to set up a sequel |url=https://www.syfy.com/syfywire/nolan_explains_how_batman |website=[[SyFy]] |access-date=August 21, 2018 |date=January 14, 2013 |archive-date=August 21, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180821223120/https://www.syfy.com/syfywire/nolan_explains_how_batman |url-status=live }}</ref>}} Batman promises to look into it, and disappears into the night.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Christian Bale]] as [[Bruce Wayne (Dark Knight trilogy)|Bruce Wayne / Batman]]:<br />A billionaire socialite who, after witnessing his parents' death in a mugging at age 8, travels around the world seven years before returning home to inherit his family company [[Wayne Enterprises]] whilst operating at night as a [[bat]]-masked [[vigilante]] bringing [[justice]] upon the criminal underworld of [[Gotham City]].

The film's ninety-piece orchestra<ref name=knightmusic/> was developed from members of various London orchestras, and Zimmer chose to use more than the normal number of cellos. Zimmer enlisted a boy soprano to help reflect the music in some of the film's scenes where tragic memories of Bruce Wayne's parents are involved. \"He's singing a fairly pretty tune and then he gets stuck, it's like froze, arrested development,\" said Zimmer. He also attempted to add a human dimension to Batman, whose behavior would typically be seen as \"psychotic\", through the music. Both composers collaborated to create 2 hours and 20 minutes worth of music for the film,<ref name=\"zimmer\"/> with Zimmer composing the action sequences and Howard focusing on the dramatic scenes.<ref name=knightmusic/>\n\n==Special effects and design==\n\n===Design===\nNolan used the 1982 [[science fiction film]] ''[[Blade Runner]]'' as a source of inspiration for ''Batman Begins''. He screened ''Blade Runner'' to Pfister and two others to show the attitude and style that he wanted to draw from the film. Nolan described the film's world as \"an interesting lesson on the technique of exploring and describing a credible universe that doesn't appear to have any boundaries\", a lesson that he applied to the production of ''Batman Begins''.<ref>{{cite news|first=Pat|last=Jankiewicz|title=Dark Knight Resurrected|work=[[Starlog]]|date=August 2005|issue = 337|pages = [https://archive.org/details/starlog_magazine-337JPG/page/n53 53]\u201357|url = https://archive.org/details/starlog_magazine-337JPG}}</ref>\n\nNolan worked with production designer Nathan Crowley to create the look of [[Gotham City]]. Crowley built a model of the city that filled Nolan's garage.<ref name=rise>''Gotham City Rises'' [DVD, 2005]</ref> Crowley and Nolan designed it as a large, modern metropolitan area that would reflect the various periods of architecture that the city had gone through. Elements were drawn from New York City, Chicago, and Tokyo; the latter for its elevated freeways and monorails. The Narrows was based on the [[slum]]mish nature of the (now demolished) [[Kowloon Walled City|walled city of Kowloon]] in Hong Kong.<ref>{{cite web|first=Jeff|last=Otto|url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2005/06/06/interview-christopher-nolan-2|title=Interview: Christopher Nolan|publisher=IGN|date=June 5, 2006|access-date=November 6, 2006|archive-date=March 31, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120331134903/http://movies.ign.com/articles/622/622719p1.html|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Tumbler===\n{{See also|Batmobile}}\nCrowley started the process of designing the Tumbler for the film by [[kitbashing|model bashing]]. Crowley used the nose cone of a [[Lockheed P-38 Lightning|P-38 Lightning]] model to serve as the chassis for the Tumbler's [[turbine]] engine. Six models of the Tumbler were built to 1:12 scale in the course of four months. Following the scale model creation, a crew of over 30 people, including Crowley and engineers Chris Culvert and Annie Smith, carved a full-size replica of the Tumbler out of a large block of [[Styrofoam]] in two months.<ref name=\"batmobile\">{{cite web|first=Marshall|last=Brain|url=http://entertainment.howstuffworks.com/arts/comic-books/batmobile.htm|title=How the Batmobile Works|date=June 16, 2005|publisher=[[HowStuffWorks]]|access-date=April 23, 2010|archive-date=June 25, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130625125343/http://entertainment.howstuffworks.com/arts/comic-books/batmobile.htm|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe styrofoam model was used to create a steel \"test frame\", which had to stand up to several standards: have a speed of over {{convert|100|mph}}, go from 0 to {{convert|60|mph}} in 5 seconds, possess a [[steering]] system to make sharp turns at city corners, and withstand a self-propelled launch of up to {{convert|30|ft|m}}. On the first jump test, the Tumbler's front end collapsed and had to be completely rebuilt. The basic configuration of the newly designed Tumbler included a [[Chevrolet small-block engine|5.7-liter Chevy V8 engine]], a truck axle for the rear axle, front tires by [[Hoosier Racing Tire|Hoosier]] (which are actually dirt racing tires used on the right rear of open wheel sprint cars), 4 rear 44/18.5-16.5 Interco Super Swamper TSL tires (44\" tall, 18.5\" wide, mounted on a 16.5\" wheel) and the [[suspension (vehicle)|suspension]] system of [[Trophy Truck|Baja racing trucks]]. The design and development process took nine months and cost several million dollars.<ref name=\"batmobile\"/>\n\nWith the design process complete, four street-ready race cars were constructed, with each vehicle possessing 65 panels and costing $250,000 to build. Two of the four cars were specialized versions. One version was the flap version, which had hydraulics and flaps to detail the close-up shots where the vehicle propelled itself through the air. The other version was the jet version, in which an actual jet engine was mounted onto the vehicle, fueled by six [[propane]] tanks. The visibility inside the vehicle was poor, so monitors were connected to cameras on the vehicle body. The professional drivers for the Tumblers practiced driving the vehicles for six months before they drove on the streets of Chicago for the film's scenes.<ref name=\"batmobile\"/>\n\nThe interior of the Tumbler was an immobile studio set and not actually the interior of a street-capable Tumbler. The cockpit was oversized to fit cameras for scenes filmed in the Tumbler interior. In addition, another version of the Tumbler was a [[radio-controlled car|miniature model]] that was 1:6 scale of the actual Tumbler. This miniature model had an electric motor and was used to show the Tumbler flying across ravines and between buildings. However, the actual Tumbler was used for the waterfall sequence.<ref name=\"batmobile\"/>\n\n===Batsuit===\n[[File:Bale as Batman.jpg|upright|thumb|The Batsuit, worn by Christian Bale.|alt=A man in a batsuit, with a cowl on his head, a utility belt, and a cape flowing behind him.]]\n\nThe filmmakers intended to create a very mobile [[Batsuit]] that would allow the wearer to move easily to fight and crouch. Previous film incarnations of the Batsuit had been stiff and especially restrictive of full head movement. [[Costume design]]er [[Lindy Hemming]] and her crew worked on the Batsuit at an FX workshop codenamed \"Cape Town\", a secured compound located at Shepperton Studios in London. The Batsuit's basic design was a [[neoprene]] undersuit, which was shaped by attaching molded cream latex sections. Christian Bale was molded and sculpted prior to his physical training so the team could work on a full body cast. To avoid imperfections picked up by sculpting with clay, plastiline was used to smooth the surface. In addition, the team brewed different mixtures of foam to find the mixture that would be the most flexible, light, durable, and black. The latter presented a problem, since the process to make the foam black reduced the foam's durability.<ref name=\"batsuit\" />\n\nFor the cape, director Christopher Nolan wanted to have a \"flowing cloak... that blows and flows as in so many great graphic novels\". Hemming's team created the cape out of their own version of parachute nylon that had electrostatic flocking, a process shared with the team by the [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|British Ministry of Defence]]. The process was used by the London police force to minimize night vision detection. The cape was topped by a [[cowl]], which was designed by Nolan, Hemming, and costume effects supervisor Graham Churchyard. The cowl was created to be thin enough to allow motion but thick enough to avoid wrinkling when Bale turned his head in the Batsuit. Churchyard explained the cowl had been designed to show \"a man who has angst\", so his character would be revealed through the mask.<ref name=\"batsuit\" />\n\n===Fight choreography===\nFight choreographers for ''Batman Begins'', Justo Dieguez and Andy Norman, trained actors and stunt performers using the Spanish ''Keysi Fighting Method'',<ref>{{cite web|first=KFOrigin|last=Gould|url=http://www.fullcontactmartialarts.org/keysi-fighting-method.html|title=Keysi Fighting Method Origin|access-date=July 28, 2018|archive-date=September 13, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180913015725/http://www.fullcontactmartialarts.org/keysi-fighting-method.html|url-status=live}}</ref> which itself gained fame after it was used in the film and its sequel, ''[[The Dark Knight (film)|The Dark Knight]]''; however, the method was modified in ''[[The Dark Knight Rises]]'' due to Batman's age and physical condition and in order to match Bale's fighting style.

Bruce's real father died before they could establish an adult relationship, and [[Liam Neeson]]'s Ducard is stern and demanding, didactic and challenging, but not a father figure with any sympathy.

Alfred provides a maternal figure of unconditional love, despite the overall lack of focus on a mother figure in Bruce's life.<ref>{{cite news|last=Fisher|first=Mark|title=Gothic Oedipus: subjectivity and Capitalism in Christopher Nolan's Batman Begins|publisher=Department of English at the University of Florida|year=2006|url=http://www.english.ufl.edu/imagetext/archives/v2_2/fisher/#13|access-date=October 13, 2007|archive-date=December 19, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081219050624/http://www.english.ufl.edu/imagetext/archives/v2_2/fisher/#13|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nFingeroth also argues that a major theme in the film is fear, which supports the story of Bruce Wayne becoming a hero. Director Christopher Nolan stated that the idea behind the film was \"a person who would confront his innermost fear and then attempt to become it\". Fingeroth referred to this film's depiction as \"the man with fear\u2014but who rises above it\". The theme of fear is further personified by the Scarecrow.<ref name=fingerothvfx/> The film depicts how fear can affect all creatures regardless of might. Allusions to fear are seen throughout, from Bruce's conquering of his demons, to becoming Batman, to the Scarecrow and his deadly fear toxin. The macabre, distorted images presented in the Scarecrow's toxin-induced hallucinations also express the idea of terror to an extreme.<ref name=\"rebuilds\">{{cite web|access-date=July 13, 2008 |url=http://english.ohmynews.com/articleview/article_view.asp?at_code=261720 |title=Thrilling 'Batman Begins' Rebuilds Franchise |publisher=OhmyNews |date=June 14, 2005 |last=Orndorf |first=Brian |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151006014859/http://english.ohmynews.com/articleview/article_view.asp?at_code=261720 |archive-date=October 6, 2015 |df=mdy }}</ref>\n\n<!-- comparisons -->\nCritic Brian Orndorf considered ''Batman Begins'' \"fierce\" and \"demonstrative in brood\", giving the film an abundance of gravitas and energy. It strays away from the lighter fare of [[Joel Schumacher]]'s 1997 Batman film, ''[[Batman & Robin (film)|Batman & Robin]]'', which contained [[Camp (style)|camp]] one-liners throughout. The theme of fear is intensified with the help of the musical score by Zimmer and Howard, which also \"eschews traditional heroic themes\".<ref name=\"rebuilds\" /> Also contrary to previous ''Batman'' films, a psychological investigation of Bruce Wayne's split personality in the bat suit is only lightly touched upon. Orndorf noted that Bruce is a \"character constantly striving to do the right thing, not worn down by incessant reexamination\".<ref name=\"rebuilds\" />\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Film|United States|Speculative fiction|United Kingdom}}\n\n* [[Vigilante film]]\n* [[Neo-noir]]\n* ''[[The Shadow (1994 film)|The Shadow]]'' \u2013 A 1994 superhero film based on [[The Shadow|the character]] that partially inspired Batman with a similar storyline of an American millionaire being trained in the East to fight crime\n* [[List of films shot in Iceland]]\n\n{{clear}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wikiquote}}\n{{Commons category}}\n* {{Official website|https://www.warnerbros.com/movies/batman-begins/}} (Warner Bros.)\n* {{Official website|https://www.dccomics.com/movies/batman-begins-2005}} (DC Comics)\n* {{IMDb title|0372784}}\n* {{isfdb title|id=980113|title=Batman Begins}}\n* {{tcmdb title|546292|Batman Begins}}\n* {{AllRovi title|289465}}\n* {{Curlie|Arts/Movies/Titles/B/Batman_Series/Batman_Begins}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20150909231537/http://www.cinemareview.com/production.asp?prodid=3001 ''Batman Begins'' Production Notes, page 1] and [https://web.archive.org/web/20150909231630/http://www.cinemareview.com/production.asp?prodid=3002 pages 2\u20136].
