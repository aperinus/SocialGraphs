Directed by  [[Tina Hirsch]], the film editor for ''[[Gremlins]]'', the film features a similar plotline.{{citation needed|date=June 2020}}\n\n==Plot==\nThe protagonist, space archaeologist Simon Watterman, discovers a fossilized \"Munchie\" in a cave in [[Peru]] and accidentally reanimates it. Bringing the specimen back to the United States, Watterman's son and girlfriend name it Arnold. Cecil Watterman, Simon's evil twin brother and snack food entrepreneur, kidnaps Arnold while Cindy and Paul are making out.\n\nWhen Arnold is hurt by his kidnappers, it becomes aggressive and attacks Cecil's adopted son. Attempting to kill Arnold, they chop him into quarters, but instead of dying, Arnold multiplies into four new Munchies. The quartet of creatures develop a love of women, attacking people, beer, and [[junk food]] in the process.\n\n==Cast==\n*Charlie Stratton (Charles Stratton) as Paul Watterman\n*[[Nadine Van der Velde]] as Cindy\n*[[Harvey Korman]] as Cecil Watterman and Simon Watterman\n*Alix Elias as Melvis Macintosh Watterman\n*[[Hardy Rawls]] as Big Ed\n*[[Robert Picardo]] as Bob Marvelle\n*[[Wendy Schaal]] as Marge Marvelle\n*[[Paul Bartel]] as Dr. Crowder\n*[[Ellen Albertini Dow]] as Little Old Lady\n*Steven Bernstein as Dean\n*[[Frank Welker]] as the voice of Munchie\n*[[Fred Newman (actor)|Fred Newman]] as the voice of Munchie<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0093582/fullcredits#cast |title=Munchies (1987) - Full cast and crew |access-date=2007-12-19 |publisher=[[Internet Movie Database]]}}</ref>\n\n==Production==\nTina Hirsch had edited three films for Corman in the 1970s and in the mid 80s told him that she wanted to direct. Corman wanted to make a ''Gremlins'' knock off, which were profitable at the time, and, since Hirsch had edited that film, it seemed a good fit. ''Munchies'' was shot over 12 days, followed by three days of filming puppets and inserts.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s3jpDAAAQBAJ&q=%22big+bad+mama%22+wynorski+interview&pg=PA163|page=163|title=It Came from the 80s!: Interviews with 124 Cult Filmmakers|first=Francesco|last= Borseti|publisher=McFarland|date=12 August 2016|isbn=9781476625638}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{wikiquote}}\n*{{IMDb title|id=0093582|title=Munchies}}\n* {{Amg movie|33772|Munchies}}\n{{Roger Corman}}\n\n[[Category:1987 films]]\n[[Category:1980s comedy horror films]]\n[[Category:American comedy horror films]]\n[[Category:1980s monster movies]]\n[[Category:1987 horror films]]\n[[Category:Puppet films]]\n[[Category:Films produced by Roger Corman]]\n[[Category:American monster movies]]\n[[Category:1987 comedy films]]\n[[Category:1980s English-language films]]\n[[Category:1980s American films]]\n\n\n{{comedy-horror-film-stub}}"}]}}}}
