It was nominated for two [[Academy Awards]], winning [[Academy Award for Best Original Song|Best Original Song]] for [[Michel Legrand]]'s \"[[The Windmills of Your Mind]]\". [[The Thomas Crown Affair (1999 film)|A remake]] was released in 1999.\n\n==Plot==\nMillionaire businessman-sportsman Thomas Crown accomplishes a [[perfect crime]] by orchestrating four men to steal $2,660,527.62 from a [[Boston]] bank (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|2660527.62|1968}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars {{inflation-fn|US}}), along with a fifth man who drives the [[Crime scene getaway|getaway]] car with the money and dumps it in a cemetery trash can. None of the men ever meets Crown face to face, nor do they know or meet each other before the robbery. Crown retrieves the money from the trash can after secretly following the driver of the getaway car. He deposits the money into an anonymous Swiss bank account in Geneva, making several trips, never depositing the money all at once so as not to draw undue attention to his actions.\n\nIndependent insurance investigator Vicki Anderson is contracted to investigate the heist; she will receive 10% of the stolen money if she recovers it. When Thomas first comes to her attention as a possible suspect, she intuitively recognizes him as the mastermind behind the robbery, and shortly thereafter guesses that he organized the robbers so none of the men knew him or met each other.\n\nThomas does not need the money, and in fact masterminded the robbery as a game. Vicki makes it clear to him that she knows that he is the thief and that she intends to prove it. They start a [[cat and mouse|game of cat and mouse]], with the attraction between them evident. Their relationship soon evolves into an affair, complicated by Vicki's vow to find the money and help detective Eddy Malone bring the guilty party to justice.\n\nA reward offer entices the wife of the bank robbery's getaway driver, Erwin Weaver to \"fink\" on him for $25,000 (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|25000|1968}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars {{inflation-fn|US}}). Vicki finds out that he was hired by a man he never saw, but whose voice he heard (via a microphone). She tries putting Erwin in the same room as Thomas, but there is no hint of recognition on either one's part.\n\nHowever, while Vicki is clearly closing in on Thomas, using the [[Internal Revenue Service]] (IRS) as leverage against his liquid assets, he forces her to realize that she is also becoming hemmed-in by her emotions. When she (seemingly) persuades him to negotiate an end, his point is proven when Eddie stubbornly refuses to make any deal.\n\nThomas organizes another robbery exactly like the first with different accomplices and tells Vicki where the \"drop\" will be, because he has to know for sure that she is on his side. The robbery is successful, but there are gunshots and the viewer is left with the impression that people might have been killed, raising the stakes for Vicki's decision.\n\nVicki and the police stake out the cemetery, where they watch one of the robbers make the drop and they wait for Thomas to arrive so they can arrest him. However, when his [[Rolls-Royce Silver Shadow|Rolls Royce]] arrives, she sees that Thomas has sent a messenger in his place, with a [[telegraphy|telegram]] asking her to bring the money and join him \u2013 or if not, \"you keep the car\". She tears the telegram to bits and throws the pieces to the wind, looking up at the sky with tears in her eyes. Crown flies away in a jet.\n\n==Cast==\n<!--- [[WP:NOTDATABASE]] - cast and order per opening stand-alone credits, roles per closing credits scroll --->\n{{Cast listing|\n*[[Steve McQueen]] as Thomas Crown\n*[[Faye Dunaway]] as Vicki Anderson\n*[[Paul Burke (actor)|Paul Burke]] as Eddy Malone\n*[[Jack Weston]] as Erwin\n*[[Biff McGuire]] as Sandy\n*[[Addison Powell]] as Abe\n*[[Gordon Pinsent]] as Jamie\n*[[Yaphet Kotto]] as Carl\n*[[Sidney Armus]] as Arnie\n*[[Richard Bull (actor)|Richard Bull]] as Booth Guard\n*Peg Shirley as Honey\n*[[Tom Rosqui]] as Private Detective\n*Michael Shillo as Swiss Banker\n*Astrid Heeren as Gwen\n}}\n\n==Production==\nThe photography is unusual for a mainstream Hollywood film, using a split-screen mode.

Director Norman Jewison had hoped to hire [[Henry Mancini]] for the project, but he was unavailable and recommended Legrand; he wrote his music as long pieces rather than specifically to scene timings, with the film later edited to the music by Legrand, Jewison and editor [[Hal Ashby]]. In addition, Legrand also had to prepare an original song to replace \"[[Strawberry Fields Forever]],\" used as the temporary track for the glider scene. Taking [[Quincy Jones]]' advice, Legrand worked with the Bergmans to compose \"[[The Windmills of Your Mind]]\" and a second song, \"His Eyes, Her Eyes\"; [[Noel Harrison]] recorded \"The Windmills of Your Mind\" after Jewison failed to get his friend [[Andy Williams]] to do it, while Legrand performed \"His Eyes, Her Eyes\". While the film's score was recorded in Hollywood, featuring [[Vincent DeRosa]], [[Bud Shank]], [[Carol Kaye]], [[Emil Richards]], [[Ray Brown (musician)|Ray Brown]] and [[Shelly Manne]], the album re-recording issued by [[United Artists Records]] on LP was done in France under the composer's baton; Jewison said it was the favourite score for any of his films.<ref>St\u00e9phane Lerouge, \"Michel Legrand: The Windmills of His Mind,\" liner notes, expanded MGM motion picture soundtrack, Quartet QR 158</ref>\n\nThe original album was later reissued by Rykodisc in 1998 on compact disc, with five dialogue excerpts and the inclusion of \"Moments Of Love\" and \"Doubting Thomas.\" [[Var\u00e8se Sarabande]] re-released the album in 2004 (without the dialogue excerpts). In 2014, Quartet Records issued a limited edition CD featuring the previously released album tracks (1\u201313 below) and the premiere release of the film version.\n\n===Expanded album track listing===\n# \"[[The Windmills of Your Mind]]\", performed by [[Noel Harrison]] \u2013 2:24\n# \"Room Service\" \u2013 1:41\n# \"A Man's Castle\" \u2013 2:41\n# \"The Chess Game\" \u2013 5:58\n# \"Cash and Carry\" \u2013 2:35\n# \"His Eyes, Her Eyes\", performed by [[Michel Legrand]] \u2013 2:17\n# \"Playing the Field\" \u2013 5:48\n# \"Moments of Love\" \u2013 2:19\n# \"The Boston Wrangler\" \u2013 2:49\n# \"Doubting Thomas\" \u2013 3:48\n# \"The Crowning Touch\" \u2013 2:59\n# \"The Windmills of Your Mind\" \u2013 2:22\n# \"His Eyes, Her Eyes\" \u2013 2:15\n# \"The Windmills of Your Mind\", performed by Noel Harrison \u2013 2:25\n# \"Knock, Knock\" \u2013 0:50\n# \"The Gang\" \u2013 3:02\n# \"Getaway\" \u2013 0:52\n# \"Escapeline\" \u2013 1:28\n# \"Cemetery\" \u2013 1:20\n# \"More Cemetery\" \u2013 1:19\n# \"Enter Vicky\" \u2013 0:25\n# \"The Windmills of Your Mind\", performed by Noel Harrison \u2013 1:25\n# \"Polo\" \u2013 0:47\n# \"Brandy\" \u2013 1:33\n# \"Chess Anyone?\" \u2013 4:26\n# \"Let's Play Something Else\" \u2013 1:18\n# \"Togetherness\" \u2013 1:38\n# \"Don't Bug Me\" \u2013 1:15\n# \"Beach House\" \u2013 1:01\n# \"Love Montage\" \u2013 1:21\n# \"No Deals\" \u2013 1:01\n# \"All My Love, Tommy\" \u2013 3:07\n\n==In popular culture==\nThe film's famous kissing scene, which is depicted on the film's poster, is famously used in [[Hal Ashby]]'s [[Being There]] (1979).  Ashby was ''The Thomas Crown Affair'''s associate producer and editor. In 1998, pop star [[Madonna]] released a video for her single \"[[The Power of Good-Bye]]\", based on the chess scene from the movie.\n\n==Remakes==\n{{Main|The Thomas Crown Affair (1999 film)}}\nThe 1999 remake stars [[Pierce Brosnan]] as Crown, [[Rene Russo]] as the insurance investigator, and [[Denis Leary]] as the detective. The original film's co-star Faye Dunaway also appears as Crown's therapist.\n\nThis version is different from the original in that it is set in New York rather than Boston and the robbery is of a priceless painting, a [[San Giorgio Maggiore at Dusk|''Monet'']], instead of cash, among other story line differences, including the complete lack of violence in Thomas Crown's crimes.{{citation needed|date=April 2022}}\n\nIn 2016, ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' announced that actor [[Michael B.
