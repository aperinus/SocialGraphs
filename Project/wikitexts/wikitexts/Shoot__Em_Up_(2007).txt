It stars [[Clive Owen]], [[Paul Giamatti]], [[Monica Bellucci]], and [[Stephen McHattie]]. The film follows Smith (Owen), a drifter who rescues a newborn from being killed by assassin Hertz (Giamatti) and his henchmen. Smith flees from the gang, enlisting the help of prostitute Donna Quintano (Bellucci) to keep the baby safe as he unravels the conspiracy.\n\nAccording to Davis, the idea for the film came about after he saw a gun-battle scene from [[John Woo]]'s critically acclaimed ''[[Hard Boiled]]'' in which [[Chow Yun-fat]] rescues newborn babies from gangsters. Desiring to make an action film centering on guns, he expanded the idea into a screenplay in 2000, accompanied by an animated footage with 17,000 drawings for the action scenes. After a deal with [[New Line Cinema]], filming began in [[Toronto]]. The film was photographed by Hong Kong cinematographer [[Peter Pau]].\n\nBefore its September 2007 release, the film was previewed at that year's [[San Diego Comic-Con]] and received a positive response. Despite a mediocre commercial performance (recouping less than its budget), critical reception to the film was largely favorable.\n\n==Plot==\nAt a bus stop in a rough part of town, a carrot-eating [[Drifter (person)|drifter]] and military veteran named Smith sees a pregnant woman on the verge of giving birth while fleeing a [[hitman]]. Following them into a warehouse, Smith kills the hitman by stabbing him in the face with a carrot and retrieves the woman's pistol. As more thugs, led by a ruthless man named Hertz, arrive, the woman goes into labor and Smith delivers her baby boy during a shootout. Pursued by Hertz, the woman is shot dead; Smith narrowly escapes with the newborn. Leaving the baby in a park, Smith hopes someone will adopt the child, but a passing woman is killed with a shot from Hertz's sniper rifle. Realizing that Hertz is trying to kill the baby, Smith saves him and tries unsuccessfully to leave him with a [[prostitute]] named Donna Quintano. \n\nHertz soon arrives at the brothel and tortures Donna for information; Smith returns and kills Hertz's henchmen. After a brief confrontation, Smith shoots Hertz and leaves with Donna and the baby. Having secretly worn a [[bulletproof vest]], however, Hertz is alive albeit wounded. Taking Donna to his hideout, Smith realizes that the baby (whom he names Oliver) stops crying when he hears heavy metal music; he concludes that Oliver's mother lived near a heavy metal club. Pursued by Hertz, Smith shoots his way out of the hideout, and he and Donna head to a nearby club. Above the club they discover an apartment with medical equipment and two dead, pregnant women; Smith concludes that the women were all impregnated with one man's sperm in order to give birth to matching [[bone marrow]] donors. \n\nWhile they are having a chat in a motel room, Smith and Donna are attacked by masked men, where he notices that his assailants' weapons are Hammerson models, unavailable to the public. Smith brings Donna and Oliver to a war museum and hides them in a [[M24 Chaffee]] tank for safekeeping. Smith infiltrates the Hammerson factory, and hears Hertz and Hammerson saying that they do not want the next president to repeal [[Right to keep and bear arms in the United States|the right to bear arms]]. He also notices that Hammerson owns a [[German Shepherd dog]] named Duchess. Smith booby-traps the facility with an array of firearms, allowing him to kill the thugs and escape. During a shootout, Heinz reveals that he had conducted an investigation about Smith's identity and it turned out Smith is a former Army Ranger whose wife and kid were killed in a shootout in a burger joint. Smith sees an article about Senator Rutledge, a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] presidential candidate who favors stricter gun laws. Smith deduces that Rutledge has cancer and requires a bone-marrow transplant. \n\nDue to which, Rutledge had impregnated the woman with his sperm (and why Hertz and Hammerson want Oliver dead). If the infants die, the senator would not receive a transplant and would be unable to run for president. Smith tells Donna to leave town and contacts one of Rutledge's henchmen to request an appointment. Meeting on an airplane, the senator confirms Smith's suspicions and Smith notices dog hair on Rutledge's trousers. Deducing that the hair belongs to Duchess and that the senator made a deal with Hammerson, Smith takes Rutledge hostage. Hertz appears and reveals that he agreed to help Rutledge find a bone-marrow donor, on the condition that Rutledge protects Hertz's constitutional right to bear arms when elected president. Smith kills the senator, whose assassination he explains \"will cause public outrage and trigger immense support\" for his [[gun control]] proposals. \n\nSmith parachutes from the airplane and kills several pursuing henchmen, but is himself shot and collapses after he lands, where he awakens in Hammerson's mansion; Hertz tortures him, breaking his fingers in an attempt to learn where Smith sent Donna and Oliver. As Hertz prepares to cut Smith's eyes, Smith breaks free and kills Hammerson and several thugs. Cornered and struggling to use his gun, Smith places live bullets between his broken fingers and detonates them with a fireplace, critically wounding Hertz. As they grab pistols and struggle, Smith fires first and kills Hertz. Smith boards a bus with Duchess, and stops at an ice-cream parlor where Donna works as a waitress while watching Oliver. Surprised to see each other alive, he and Donna kiss passionately. A group of amateur armed robbers suddenly enters the parlor; his hands in bandages, Smith shoots them by using a carrot to pull the trigger.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Clive Owen]] as Mr. Smith<ref name=\"bfi\">{{cite web|title=Shoot 'em Up (2007)|url=http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b8c24257f|publisher=[[British Film Institute]]|access-date=December 7, 2017|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171207143750/http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b8c24257f|archive-date=December 7, 2017|df=mdy-all}}</ref>  \n* [[Paul Giamatti]] as Mr. Karl Hertz<ref name=\"bfi\"/>\n* [[Monica Bellucci]] as Donna Quintano<ref name=\"bfi\"/>\n* [[Stephen McHattie]] as Hammerson<ref name=\"bfi\"/>\n* [[Greg Bryk]] as Go-To Guy<ref name=\"bfi\"/>\n* [[Daniel Pilon]] as Senator Rutledge<ref name=\"bfi\"/>\n* [[Ramona Pringle]] as Baby's mother<ref name=\"bfi\"/>\n* [[Julian Richings]] as Hertz's driver<ref name=\"bfi\"/>\n* [[Stephen R.
