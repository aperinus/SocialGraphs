It is a [[remake]] of [[Hideo Nakata]]'s 1998 [[Japanese horror]] film ''[[Ring (film)|Ring]]'', based on [[Koji Suzuki (writer)|Koji Suzuki]]'s [[Ring (Suzuki novel)|1991 novel]] of the same name. Watts portrays a journalist who investigates a cursed videotape that seemingly kills the viewer seven days after watching it.\n\n''The Ring'' was released theatrically on October 18, 2002, and received mostly positive reviews, with critics praising the atmosphere, visuals, and Watts's performance. The film grossed over $249 million worldwide on a $48 million production budget, making it one of the highest-grossing horror remakes. It is the first installment of the [[The Ring (franchise)#American films|English-language ''Ring'' series]], and is followed by ''[[The Ring Two]]'' (2005) and ''[[Rings (2017 film)|Rings]]'' (2017).\n\n''The Ring'' paved the way for English-language remakes of Asian horror films, such as ''[[The Grudge]]'' and ''[[Dark Water (2005 film)|Dark Water]]''.\n\n==Plot==\nTeenagers Katie and Becca discuss an urban legend about a cursed videotape; whoever watches it dies seven days later. Katie confesses that she watched the tape with her friends the previous week. That night, Katie is killed by an unseen force.\n\nAt Katie's funeral, Katie's mother Ruth asks her sister [[Rachel Keller|Rachel]], a [[Seattle]] journalist, to investigate the death. Rachel discovers that Katie's friends were killed in bizarre accidents on the night of her death. She also learns that Becca has been institutionalized after witnessing Katie's death. Rachel goes to Shelter Mountain Inn, the mountain retreat where Katie and her friends watched the tape. She rents the same cabin and watches the tape; it contains strange and disturbing imagery. After the tape ends, she receives a phone call from an unknown caller who whispers \"seven days\".\n\nRachel recruits the help of her video analyst ex-boyfriend Noah. He watches the tape and Rachel makes him a copy so they can both investigate where it came from. Rachel begins to see images from the tape appear in the real world. She discovers hidden imagery of a lighthouse and identifies a woman on the tape: a horse breeder, Anna Morgan, who committed suicide after some of her horses drowned themselves off Moesko Island. Rachel finds their son, Aidan, watching the videotape.\n\nLeaving Aidan in Ruth's care, Rachel heads for Moesko Island to speak to Anna's widower, Richard, while Noah travels to Eola Psychiatric Hospital to view Anna's medical files. On the ferry to the island, a horse is spooked by Rachel and leaps to its death. On the island, she discovers Anna had an adopted daughter, [[Sadako Yamamura|Samara]], but Richard denies it. Rachel speaks to the island doctor, who explains that Anna adopted Samara due to her [[infertility]]. Samara possessed the ability to [[Thoughtography|psychically etch images]] onto objects and into minds, tormenting her parents and their horses. Noah finds a psychiatric file on Samara which mentions a missing video record last seen by Richard.\n\nReturning to the Morgan home, Rachel finds the missing video, watching it to discover Samara explaining her powers during a psychotherapy session. Discovering Rachel, Richard strikes her and then electrocutes himself in the bathtub, insisting that Samara is evil and that Rachel's actions have endangered them all. Noah arrives and he and Rachel enter the barn. In a loft converted to a bedroom to isolate Samara from her mother, they find an image of a tree behind the wallpaper; Rachel recognizes it as a tree at the Shelter Mountain Inn.\n\nRachel returns with Noah to the cabin at Shelter Mountain Inn, where they are led to a [[water well|well]] beneath the floorboards. They remove the lid and Rachel is pushed inside. A hand grabs her, and Rachel experiences a vision of Anna suffocating and dumping Samara into the well, where she survived for seven days. Samara's corpse surfaces from the water. After Rachel is rescued from the well, they arrange a proper burial for Samara. Noah tells Rachel that they are now safe as more than seven days have passed since she watched the videotape.\n\nAidan warns Rachel that it was a mistake to try to help Samara. Rachel realizes that Noah's seven days are up and rushes to save him, but the vengeful ghost of Samara materializes on his TV screen, crawls out of it and kills him. Rachel finds his disfigured corpse and returns home to destroy the tape. Unable to deduce why she was spared, she realizes that the videotape seen by Noah and Aidan was a copy she'd created. Rachel has Aidan make a copy of the copy to show to someone else, saving him from Samara.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n*[[Naomi Watts]] as [[Rachel Keller]]\n*[[David Dorfman]] as Aidan Keller\n*[[Martin Henderson]] as Noah Clay\n*[[Daveigh Chase]] as [[Samara Morgan]]\n*[[Brian Cox (actor)|Brian Cox]] as Richard Morgan\n*[[Shannon Cochran]] as Anna Morgan\n*[[Jane Alexander]] as Dr. Grasnik\n*[[Lindsay Frost]] as Ruth Embry\n*[[Amber Tamblyn]] as Katherine \"Katie\" Embry\n*[[Rachael Bella]] as Rebecca \"Becca\" Kotler\n*[[Richard Lineback]] as Innkeeper\n*[[Pauley Perrette]] as Beth\n*[[Sara Rue]] as Babysitter\n*[[Sasha Barrese]] as Girl Teen #1\n*Tess Hall as Girl Teen #2\n*[[Adam Brody]] as Kellen (Male Teen)\n*[[Michael Spound]] as Dave Embry\n*[[Chris Cooper]] as a child murderer (uncredited)\n*[[Joe Chrest]] as Dr. Scott (uncredited)\n*[[Maury Ginsberg]] as a video store clerk (DVD deleted scenes) (uncredited)\n}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\n''The Ring'' went into production without a completed script.<ref name=iwgv>{{cite web|url=http://www.curseofthering.com/gore.php|title=Interview with Gore Verbinski|date=2002|publisher=curseofthering.com|access-date=March 2, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170302113145/http://www.curseofthering.com/gore.php|archive-date=March 2, 2017}}</ref> [[Ehren Kruger]] wrote three drafts of the screenplay before [[Scott Frank]] came on to do an uncredited rewrite. Verbinski was initially inspired to do a remake of ''Ring'' after [[Walter F.
