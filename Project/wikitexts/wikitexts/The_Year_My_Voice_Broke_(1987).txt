Set in 1962 in the rural [[Southern Tablelands]] of [[New South Wales]], it was the first in a projected [[trilogy]] of films centred on the experiences of an awkward Australian boy, based on the childhood of writer/director [[John Duigan]]. The film itself is a series of interconnected segments narrated by Danny who recollects how he and his best friend Freya grew apart over the course of one year. Although the trilogy never came to fruition, it was followed by a 1991 sequel, ''[[Flirting (film)|Flirting]]''. The film was the recipient of the 1987 [[Australian Film Institute Award for Best Film]], a prize which ''Flirting'' also won in 1990.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1962 in rural New South Wales, Australia, Danny is a thin, socially awkward 15-year-old boy who has been best friends with Freya since childhood. Freya was adopted as a baby; as a result, she is the subject of town gossip and rumors about her possible biological parents. The two spend their days at their childhood hangout on the outskirts of town, experimenting with telepathy and hypnosis.\n\nDanny has grown feelings for Freya, but unfortunately for him, Freya becomes attracted to Trevor, a high school rugby star, [[larrikin]] and petty criminal who helps Danny with the school bullies. Danny begrudgingly befriends Trevor, and the trio discover an abandoned house that is rumored to be haunted. The three teens spend a night in the house, with Trevor and Freya sleeping together while Danny is off in a corner, faking being asleep. The next day, Trevor steals a car for a [[Joyride (crime)|joyride]].  He is arrested and sent to [[juvenile detention]]; during his time away, Freya reveals to Danny that she is pregnant. Danny offers to marry her and claim the child is his, but Freya refuses, saying that she does not want to marry anyone. Meanwhile, intrigued by a locket left to Freya by an elderly friend of theirs who recently died\u2014engraved \"SEA\"\u2014Danny begins to investigate the town's past, and discovers a lone cross in the cemetery bearing those initials, belonging to a \"Sara Elizabeth Amery,\" who died days after Freya was born. Through inquiries with his parents, Danny learns that Sara was well known for her sexual promiscuity years ago, and that she was Freya's biological mother, who died trying to give birth by herself at the abandoned house.\n\nMeanwhile, Trevor breaks out of detention, steals another car, and severely wounds a store clerk during an [[armed robbery]]. Trevor returns to town long enough to reunite with Freya at the abandoned house, where he learns of her pregnancy. The police arrive at the house, but Danny aids in Trevor's escape. The police then run Trevor's car off the road during the course of the pursuit, and Trevor dies the next day. Freya disappears, and later suffers a [[miscarriage]] and hypothermia until Danny finds her at the abandoned house and takes her to the hospital. Hesitantly, Danny reveals the identity of Freya's mother to her. Realising the stigma now hanging over her, Freya decides to leave on the night train for the city. At the station, Danny gives her his life's savings to support herself and sees her off\u2014promising their friendship to one another and to keep in touch. Later, Danny travels to their favourite hangout spot and carves the names of Freya, Trevor and his own into a rock, as his adult self informs the audience that he never saw Freya again.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Noah Taylor]] as Danny Embling\n* [[Loene Carmen]] as Freya Olson\n* [[Ben Mendelsohn]] as Trevor Leishman\n* [[Graeme Blundell]] as Nils Olson\n* [[Lynette Curran]] as Anne Olson\n* Malcolm Robertson as Bruce Embling\n* [[Judi Farr]] as Sheila Embling\n\n== Production ==\nJohn Duigan wrote a script based on his experiences going to a [[boarding school]] in the mid-1960s called ''Flirting''. Unable to get the film funded, he wrote a prequel, ''The Year My Voice Broke'', based on the leading character growing up in a country town. Duigan had worked with [[Kennedy Miller Mitchell|Kennedy Miller]] making the miniseries ''Vietnam'' and they agreed to make the film as one of four [[Television film|telemovies]] they were making for the [[Network 10|Channel Ten]] network. Duigan was allowed to make the film on [[35 mm movie film|35 mm]].<ref name=\"stratton2\">{{cite book |first=David |last=Stratton |title=The Avocado Plantation: Boom and Bust in the Australian Film Industry |publisher=Pan MacMillan |year=1990 |pages=348\u2013350 |isbn=0-7329-0250-9}}</ref><ref name=\"duigan\">{{cite journal |first=Scott |last=Murray |title=John Duigan: Awakening the Dormant |journal=[[Cinema Papers]] |date=November 1989 |pages=31\u201335, 77}}</ref> The film was shot, but not set, in [[Braidwood, New South Wales]].<ref name=\":0\" /> It had several working titles, including ''Reflections of a Golden Childhood''<ref>{{Cite web |date=21 November 2018 |title=Ben Mendelsohn Breaks Down His Most Iconic Characters {{!}} GQ |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IpbcKzs03j8 |access-date=8 April 2022 |website=[[YouTube]]}} [timestamp at 0:13]</ref> and ''Museum of Desire.''\n\n==Music==\nThe main theme used in the film is \"[[The Lark Ascending]]\" by English composer [[Ralph Vaughan Williams]].
