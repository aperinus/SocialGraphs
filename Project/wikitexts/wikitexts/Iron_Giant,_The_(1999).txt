Feature Animation]] and directed by [[Brad Bird]] in his [[List of directorial debuts|directorial debut]]. It is based on the 1968 novel ''[[The Iron Man (novel)|The Iron Man]]'' by [[Ted Hughes]] (which was published in the United States as ''The Iron Giant'') and was scripted by [[Tim McCanlies]] from a story treatment by Bird. The film stars the voices of [[Jennifer Aniston]], [[Harry Connick Jr.]], [[Vin Diesel]], [[James Gammon]], [[Cloris Leachman]], [[John Mahoney]], [[Eli Marienthal]], [[Christopher McDonald]], and [[M. Emmet Walsh]]. Set during the [[Cold War]] in 1957, the film centers on a young boy named Hogarth Hughes, who discovers and befriends a giant alien robot. With the help of a [[beatnik]] artist named Dean McCoppin, Hogarth attempts to prevent the U.S. military and Kent Mansley, a paranoid federal agent, from finding and destroying the Giant.\n\nThe film's development began in 1994 as a [[Musical film|musical]] with the involvement of [[the Who]]'s [[Pete Townshend]], though the project took root once Bird signed on as director and hired McCanlies to write the screenplay in 1996. The film was animated using [[traditional animation]], with [[computer-generated imagery]] used to animate the Iron Giant and other effects. The understaffed crew of the film completed it with half of the time and budget of other animated features. [[Michael Kamen]] composed the film's score, which was performed by the [[Czech Philharmonic]].\n\n''The Iron Giant'' premiered at [[TCL Chinese Theatre|Mann's Chinese Theater]] in Los Angeles on July 31, 1999, and was released in the United States on August 6. The film significantly underperformed at the box office, grossing $31.3 million worldwide against a production budget of $50 million, which was blamed on Warner Bros.' unusually poor marketing campaign and skepticism towards animated film production following the mixed critical reception and box office failure of ''[[Quest for Camelot]]'' in the preceding year. Despite this, the film was praised for its story, animation, characters, the portrayal of the title character and the voice performances of Aniston, Connick Jr., Diesel, Mahoney, Marienthal and McDonald. The film was nominated for several awards, winning nine [[Annie Awards]] out of 15 nominations. Through [[home video]] releases and television syndication, the film gathered a [[cult following]] and is widely regarded as a modern animated classic, and one of the greatest animated films ever made.<ref name=remastered>{{cite news|url=https://variety.com/2015/film/news/iron-giant-new-scenes-remastered-edition-release-date-1201601135/|title=Duncan Studios Adds New 'Iron Giant' Scenes for Remastered Re-release|quote=Brad Bird\u2019s 1999 '''animated classic''' ''The Iron Giant''...|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=September 24, 2015|access-date=October 5, 2015|first=Terry|last=Flores|archive-date=October 6, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151006024108/http://variety.com/2015/film/news/iron-giant-new-scenes-remastered-edition-release-date-1201601135/|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.oregonlive.com/movies/2014/01/the_iron_giant_a_modern_classi.html|title='The Iron Giant,' a modern classic of animation returns: Indie & art house films|publisher=[[OregonLive.com]]|quote=Released in 1999, this '''modern classic''' of hand-drawn animation|date=January 20, 2014|access-date=October 5, 2015|first=Jamie S.|last=Rich|archive-date=October 7, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151007182823/http://www.oregonlive.com/movies/2014/01/the_iron_giant_a_modern_classi.html|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://blogs.indiewire.com/theplaylist/5-things-you-might-not-know-about-brad-birds-the-iron-giant-20120806|title=5 Things You Might Not Know About Brad Bird's 'The Iron Giant'|quote=is now widely recognized as a '''modern classic'''|work=[[IndieWire]]|date=August 6, 2012|access-date=October 5, 2015|first=Oliver|last=Lyttelton|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151006043238/http://blogs.indiewire.com/theplaylist/5-things-you-might-not-know-about-brad-birds-the-iron-giant-20120806|archive-date=2015-10-06|url-status=dead}}</ref> In 2015, an extended, [[remaster]]ed version of the film was re-released theatrically,<ref name=remastered /><ref>[https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=doSJxiYp9yo        Official 2015 re-release trailer - Rotten Tomatoes Trailers on YouTube]</ref> and on home video the following year.<ref name=\"BOBuz\" /><ref name=\"BR\" />\n\n== Plot ==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, the plot summary should be 400-700 words. -->\nDuring the [[Cold War]], an object from space crashes in the ocean just off the coast of [[Maine]] and then enters the forest near the town of Rockwell.\n\nThe following night, nine-year-old Hogarth Hughes investigates and finds the object, a 50-foot tall alien [[robot]] attempting to eat the transmission lines of an electrical substation. Hogarth eventually befriends the Giant, finding him docile and curious. When he eats railroad tracks in the path of an oncoming train, the train collides with him and derails; Hogarth leads the Giant away from the area, discovering that he can self-repair. While there, Hogarth shows the Giant comic books and compares him to the hero [[Superman]].\n\nThe incidents lead a [[xenophobic]] U.S. government agent named Kent Mansley to Rockwell. He suspects Hogarth's involvement after talking with him and his widowed mother, Annie, and rents a room in their house to keep an eye on him. Hogarth evades Mansley and leads the Giant to a junkyard owned by [[beatnik]] artist Dean McCoppin, who reluctantly agrees to keep him. Hogarth enjoys his time with the Giant but is compelled to explain the concept of death to the Giant after he witnesses hunters killing a deer.\n\nHogarth is interrogated by Mansley when he discovers evidence of the Giant after finding a photo of him next to Hogarth and summons a U.S. Army contingent led by General Shannon Rogard to the scrapyard to prove the Giant's existence, but Dean (having been warned by Hogarth earlier) tricks them by pretending that the Giant is one of his art pieces. Later, while playing with a toy gun, Hogarth inadvertently activates the Giant's defensive system; Dean yells at him for nearly killing Hogarth, and the saddened Giant runs away with Hogarth giving chase. Dean quickly realizes that the Giant was only acting in self-defense and catches up to Hogarth as they follow the Giant.\n\nThe Giant saves two boys falling from a roof when he arrives, winning over the townspeople. Mansley spots the Giant in the town while leaving Rockwell and has the Army attack the Giant after he has picked up Hogarth, forcing the two to flee together. They initially evade the military by using the Giant's flight system, but the Giant is shot down and crashes to the ground.\n\nHogarth is knocked unconscious, but the Giant gives in to his defensive system in a fit of rage and grief, transforming into a war machine and returning to Rockwell. Mansley convinces Rogard to prepare a nuclear missile launch from the [[USS Nautilus (SSN-571)|USS ''Nautilus'']], as conventional weapons prove to be ineffective. Hogarth awakens and returns in time to calm the Giant while Dean clarifies the situation to Rogard.\n\nRogard is ready to stand down and order the ''Nautilus'' to deactivate its primed nuke, but a panicked Mansley impulsively orders the missile launch, causing the missile to head towards Rockwell, where it will destroy the town upon impact in the resulting [[nuclear detonation]]. Mansley tries escaping after being lectured by Rogard, but the Giant intervenes, and Rogard has Mansley arrested. To save the town, the Giant bids farewell to Hogarth and flies off to intercept the missile. As he soars directly into the missile's path, the Giant remembers Hogarth's words, \"You are who you choose to be,\" smiles contentedly, and says \"Superman\" as he collides with the weapon. The missile explodes in the atmosphere, saving Rockwell, its population, and the military forces nearby, while the Giant is presumably destroyed, leaving Hogarth, Dean, Annie, and Rogard devastated.\n\nMonths later, a memorial of the Giant stands in Rockwell. Dean and Annie begin a relationship. Hogarth is given a package from Rogard containing a screw from the Giant, which is the only remnant found. That night, Hogarth finds the screw trying to move on its own and, remembering the Giant's ability to self-repair, happily allows the screw to leave.\n\nThe screw joins many other parts as they converge on the Giant's head on the [[Langj\u00f6kull]] glacier in [[Iceland]], and the Giant smiles as he begins reassembling himself.\n\n== Voice cast ==\n<!--- Cast, order and roles per tombstone closing credits --->\n[[File:Iron Giant, LA Animation Festival, Christopher McDonald, Brad Bird, Eli Marienthol.jpg|thumb|[[Christopher McDonald]], [[Brad Bird]] and [[Eli Marienthal]] in March 2012 at the ''Iron Giant'' screening at the LA Animation Festival]]\n* [[Eli Marienthal]] as Hogarth Hughes, an intelligent, curious, energetic, and courageous 9-year-old boy with an active imagination.

In the 1980s, rock musician [[Pete Townshend]] chose to adapt the book for a [[concept album]]; it was released as ''[[The Iron Man: The Musical by Pete Townshend|The Iron Man: A Musical]]'' in 1989.<ref name=\"productionotes\">{{cite web|url=http://movies.warnerbros.com/irongiant/cmp/makingof-fr.html |title=The Making of ''The Iron Giant'' |publisher=[[Warner Bros.]] |access-date=January 14, 2008 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20060321055611/http://movies.warnerbros.com/irongiant/cmp/production.html |archive-date=March 21, 2006 |url-status=dead}}</ref> In 1991, Richard Bazley, who later became the film's lead animator, pitched a version of ''The Iron Man'' to [[Don Bluth]] while working at [[Sullivan Bluth Studios|his studio]] in [[Ireland]].

He credited his time working on ''[[Family Dog (TV series)|Family Dog]]'' as essential to team-building, and his tenure on ''[[The Simpsons]]'' as an example of working under strict deadlines.<ref name=\"birdint09\" /> He was open to others on his staff to help develop the film; he would often ask crew members their opinions on scenes and change things accordingly.<ref name=\"lat99\" /> One of his priorities was to emphasize softer, character-based moments, as opposed to more frenetic scenes\u2014something Bird thought was a problem with modern filmmaking. \"There has to be activity or sound effects or cuts or music blaring.

Newton's first assignment on staff involved being asked by Bird to create a film within a film to reflect the \"hygiene-type movies that everyone saw when the bomb scare was happening.\" Newton came to the conclusion that a musical number would be the catchiest alternative, and the \"[[Duck and Cover (film)|Duck and Cover]]\" sequence came to become one of the crew members' favorites of the film.<ref name=\"commentary\" /> Nicknamed \"The X-Factor\" by story department head Jeffery Lynch, the producers gave him artistic freedom on various pieces of the film's script.<ref name=\"dvdint\">{{cite video| people = Brad Bird, Jeffery Lynch | title =''The Iron Giant'' Special Edition.

Although the production was watched closely, Bird commented \"They did leave us alone if we kept it in control and showed them we were producing the film responsibly and getting it done on time and doing stuff that was good.\" Bird regarded the trade-off as having \"one-third of the money of a [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Disney]] or [[DreamWorks Animation|DreamWorks]] film, and half of the production schedule,\" but the payoff as having more creative freedom, describing the film as \"fully-made by the animation team; I don't think any other studio can say that to the level that we can.\"<ref name=\"awm99\" /> A small part of the team took a weeklong research trip to [[Maine]], where they photographed and videotaped five small cities. They hoped to accurately reflect its culture down to the minutiae; \"we shot store fronts, barns, forests, homes, home interiors, diners, every detail we could, including the bark on trees,\" said production designer Mark Whiting.<ref name=\"aa99.3\" />\n\nBird stuck to elaborate scene planning, such as detailed [[animatics]], to make sure there were no budgetary concerns.<ref name=\"awm99\" /> The team initially worked with [[Macromedia]]'s [[Adobe Director|Director]] software, before switching to [[Adobe After Effects]] full-time. Bird was eager to use the then-nascent software, as it allowed for storyboard to contain indications of camera moves.
