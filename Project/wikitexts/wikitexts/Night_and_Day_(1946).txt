Warner]] as executive producer. The screenplay was written by [[Charles Hoffman (screenwriter)|Charles Hoffman]], [[Leo Townsend]] and [[William Bowers]].\n\nThe music score by [[Ray Heindorf]] and [[Max Steiner]] was nominated for an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]]. The film features several of the best-known Porter songs, including the title song \"[[Night and Day (song)|Night and Day]],\" \"[[Begin the Beguine]],\" and \"[[My Heart Belongs to Daddy]].\"\n\n[[Alexis Smith]] plays [[Linda Lee Thomas|Linda Lee Porter]], Porter's wife of 35 years. [[Monty Woolley]] and [[Mary Martin]] appear as themselves.\n\n== Production ==\n[[Jack L. Warner|Jack Warner]] paid $300,000 for the rights to Cole Porter's best known songs, and viewed the film as a \"big-budget extravaganza\" that would celebrate Warner Brothers' twenty years in sound films.  The scriptwriters knew that the film would need to be fictionalized, because he lacked the \"rags to riches\" quality common to subjects of biographical films, and was gay. Depictions of homosexuality were prohibited by film industry's [[Motion Picture Production Code|Production Code]].<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|last=Glancy|first=Mark|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3vQTEAAAQBAJ&dq=monty+woolley+miss+otis+regrets+night+and+day&pg=PA265|title=Cary Grant, the Making of a Hollywood Legend|date=2020-09-25|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-005313-0|pages=263\u2013266|language=en}}</ref>\n\nWarner paid Grant $100,000 and bought out his contract at [[Columbia Pictures]] at a considerably greater sum. Grant and Curtiz clashed often, with much of the fighting over a script Grant viewed as weak, with \"lousy characterizations.\" Much of the script was rewritten at his behest. Grant sometimes refused to act in scenes that he felt were poorly written, and was critical of other aspects of production. He later recalled that Curtiz lost his temper so much that the director sometimes lost his train of thought.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nGrant sings several of the songs, which made ''Night and Day'' the closest he came to making a musical after the end of his stage career. He was described by his biographer as a \"competent though not a very expressive singer.\"<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nProduction of the film was impeded by a 1945 strike of the Conference of Studio Workers, who represented film [[Set construction|set builders]].<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Cary Grant]] as [[Cole Porter]]\n* [[Alexis Smith]] as [[Linda Lee Thomas|Linda Lee Porter]]\n* [[Monty Woolley]] as himself \n* [[Ginny Simms]] as Carole Hill\n* [[Jane Wyman]] as Gracie Harris \n* [[Eve Arden]] as Gabrielle\n* [[Victor Francen]] as Anatole Giron \n* [[Alan Hale Sr.]] as Leon Dowling \n* [[Dorothy Malone]] as Nancy \n* [[Tom D'Andrea]] as Tommy \n* [[Selena Royle]] as Kate Porter \n* [[Donald Woods (actor)|Donald Woods]] as Ward Blackburn \n* [[Henry Stephenson]] as Omar Cole \n* [[Paul Cavanagh]] as Bart McClelland \n* [[Sig Ruman]] as Wilowski \n* [[Mary Martin]] as herself \n* [[Gordon Richards (actor)|Gordon Richards]] as Cochran (uncredited)\n}}\n\n== Plot summary ==\nThe film is an almost entirely fictionalized<ref name=\":1\" /> version of the life of Cole Porter from his college days at Yale University, where he is studying law at the encouragement of his grandfather. One of his law professors, Monty Woolley, playing himself, encourages his song-writing.\n\nPorter abandons study of law and Woolley leaves Yale as well. Porter's songwriting is interrupted by [[French Foreign Legion]] service in the First World War, in which he is wounded. He resumes music after the war, and weds Linda, a longtime family friend. Their marriage suffers due to Porter's dedication to his songwriting, which leaves him little time for a personal life.\n\nAt the height of his career, after many successes, Porter suffers a serious accident while horseback riding, fracturing both his legs and remaining crippled. Despite many operations he cannot walk without assistance. In the end, he reunites with Linda, who had left him.\n\nUnsurprisingly, the film completely omits any mention of Porter's homosexuality. \n\n== Reception ==\nIn a review upon release of the film, ''[[The New York Times]]'' called the film \"a generally pleasant and musically exciting show.\" The Times praised the musical numbers and the performances by Grant and Woolley, but noted the straying from historical fact and the thin and conventional scenario the scenarists concocted about the fabulous Mr. Porter.\"<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|date=1946-07-26|title=THE SCREEN; 'Night and Day,' Warner Version of Cole Porter's Life, Opens at Hollywood--Cary Grant and Monty Woolley in Leads|language=en-US|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1946/07/26/archives/the-screen-night-and-day-warner-version-of-cole-porters-life-opens.html|access-date=2021-04-13|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> In 2004, at the debut of another film on Porter's life, ''[[De-Lovely]]'', the ''Times'' called Night and Day \"so-bad-it's-almost-good.\" The newspaper recounted that when Night and Day was being filmed, \"Orson Welles cracked: 'What will they use for a climax?
