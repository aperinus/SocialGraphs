The film stars [[Bruce Lee]], [[John Saxon]] and [[Jim Kelly (martial artist)|Jim Kelly]]. It was Lee's final completed film appearance before his death on 20 July 1973 at the age of 32. An American and Hong Kong co-production, it premiered in [[Los Angeles]] on 19 August 1973, one month after Lee's death. The film is estimated to have grossed over {{US$|400 million}} worldwide (estimated to be the equivalent of over {{US$|2 billion|long=no}} adjusted for inflation {{as of|2022|lc=y}}), against a budget of $850,000.

Lee is persuaded to attend a high-profile martial arts tournament on Han's private island to gather evidence that will prove Han's involvement in [[drug trafficking]] and [[prostitution]]. Shortly before his departure, Lee also learns that the man responsible for his sister's death, O'Hara, is working as Han's bodyguard on the island. Also fighting in the competition are Roper, an indebted [[gambling]] addict, and fellow [[Vietnam War]] veteran Williams. At the end of the first day, Han gives strict orders to the competitors not to leave their rooms. Lee makes contact with [[covert operative]] Mei Ling and sneaks into Han's underground compound, looking for evidence. He is discovered by several guards, but manages to escape.\n\nThe next morning, Han orders his giant enforcer Bolo to kill the guards in public for failing in their duties. After the execution, the competition resumes with Lee facing O'Hara. Lee beats O'Hara in humiliating fashion, then kills him after he attacks Lee with a pair of broken bottles. Han abruptly ends the day's competition after stating that O'Hara's treachery has disgraced them. Han confronts Williams, who had also left his room the previous night to exercise. Han believes Williams to have knowledge of the intruder and after a destructive brawl, beats Williams to death with his iron [[prosthetic]] hand. Han then reveals his drug operation to Roper, hoping that he will join his organisation. Han also implicitly threatens to imprison Roper, along with all the other martial artists who joined Han's tournaments in the past, if Roper will not join his operation. Despite being initially intrigued, Roper refuses after learning of Williams's fate.\n\nLee sneaks out again that night and manages to send a message to Braithwaite, but he is captured after a prolonged battle with the guards. The next morning, Han arranges for Roper to fight Lee, but Roper refuses. As a punishment, Roper has to fight Bolo instead, whom he manages to overpower and beat after a grueling battle. Enraged by the unexpected failure, Han commands his remaining men to kill Lee and Roper. Facing insurmountable odds, they are soon aided by the island's prisoners and the other invited martial artists, who had been freed by Mei Ling. Han escapes and is pursued by Lee, who finally corners him in his [[museum]]. After a brutal fight, Han runs away into a hidden mirror room. The mirrors initially give Han an advantage, but Lee smashes all the room's mirrors to reveal Han's location and eventually kills him. Lee returns outside to the main battle, which is now over. Bruised and bloodied, Lee and Roper exchange a weary [[Thumb signal|thumbs-up]] as the military finally arrives to take control of the island.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Bruce Lee]] as Lee, a martial artist who instructs pupils at the [[Shaolin Temple]]. He is given an assignment to infiltrate Han's island.\n* [[John Saxon]] as Roper, a martial artist and gambling addict who is invited to Han's island.\n* [[Jim Kelly (martial artist)|Jim Kelly]] as Williams, a martial artist who is invited to Han's island.
