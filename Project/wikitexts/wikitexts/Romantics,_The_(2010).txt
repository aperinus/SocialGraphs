Before he got involved with Lila, Tom was in a serious relationship with Laura (the two relationships overlapped). Laura is a bridesmaid at the wedding, and having a hard time disguising her emotional upset and disappointment over how things worked out.\n\nWhile the other friends joke, amiably bicker, and erotically cavort, Lila and Tom deal with their uncertainties over the impending nuptials, while Laura, much more restrained and buttoned down than the others, tries to talk Tom out of going through with it. The night before the wedding, they have an intense conversation, where he tells her that their romance was emotionally exhausting for him, too many highs and lows. She believes he's betraying his ideals, but it's not clear he ever had any.  Later, they have sex.\n\nThe next morning, Laura tells Lila what happened, claiming that she wants to save her friend from a bad marriage.  Lila understandably insists Laura did what she did out of jealousy, and is simply trying to break her and Tom up.  She still has every intention of going through with the wedding, in spite of her own doubts.\n\nDuring the exchange of vows at the outdoor service, held by the ocean, Tom enters into a rambling improvised monologue about how he has nothing to say.  Then a thunderstorm hits, and everyone runs back to the house laughing, except for him and Laura, who smile at each other over the humor of the situation.  It is unclear whether or not the wedding will proceed.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Katie Holmes]] as Laura Rosen<ref>{{cite web | date = September 23, 2009 | author = Jill Goldsmith | url = https://www.variety.com/article/VR1118009076 | title = ICM's Bartlett boosts young talent | work = Variety }}</ref>\n* [[Anna Paquin]] as Lila Hayes\n* [[Josh Duhamel]] as Tom McDevon\n* [[Dianna Agron]] as Minnow Hayes\n* [[Adam Brody]] as Jake\n* [[Malin \u00c5kerman]] as Tripler\n* [[Elijah Wood]] as Chip Hayes\n* Rebecca Lawrence as Weesie\n* [[Jeremy Strong (actor)|Jeremy Strong]] as Pete\n* [[Annabel Brooks]] as Sky Rosen\n* [[Candice Bergen]] as Augusta Hayes\n* James K.
