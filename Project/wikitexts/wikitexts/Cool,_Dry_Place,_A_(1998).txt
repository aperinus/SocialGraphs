Smith]]. The film stars [[Vince Vaughn]], [[Monica Potter]], [[Joey Lauren Adams]] and Bobby Moat.\n\n== Plot ==\nSingle father Russ balances work as a lawyer with caring for his five-year-old son Calvin after wife and mother Kate left them two years ago. Russ and Calvin have moved to small-town [[Kansas]] from [[Chicago]] after Russ's corporate law firm fired him for spending more time with his son. Grandpa sends Calvin a jellyfish from Florida. It is obviously dead but the boy wants to keep it, calling it \"Mom\".\n\nWhile working at a smaller law firm, Russ also coaches the local high school basketball team. He benches the disrespectful Noah for his frequent absences from practice. In retaliation, Noah's older sister and guardian Beth dumps a bag of dog food on Russ's windshield. She frightens Calvin, but in making it up to the boy she and Russ are drawn into a romantic relationship.\n\nTheir new relationship is interrupted when wife Kate reappears, wanting to reassert herself in her son's life. Russ feels torn between the two women and about what to do with Calvin. Kate clouds Russ's ability to raise his son on his own, which leads Russ to doubt in his own parenting skills. As Russ starts to think he might reconcile with Kate, she confesses that not only has she fallen in love with someone else, but that she probably never even loved Russ.\n\nWhile Russ is in [[Dallas]] interviewing for his dream job at a major law firm, Kate runs off with Calvin to [[Cincinnati]]. When he realizes the boy is missing, he talks to Beth, who convinces him that Calvin needs him and he must try to get him back. Russ turns down the job in Dallas, Kate relinquishes the boy back to Russ, and Russ and Calvin return to Kansas and Beth.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n*[[Vince Vaughn]] as Russell Durrell\n*[[Joey Lauren Adams]] as Beth Ward\n*[[Monica Potter]] as Kate Durrell\n*Bobby Moat as Calvin Durrell\n*[[Devon Sawa]] as Noah Ward\n*[[Dean McDermott]] as Deputy Sheriff Pritchard\n*[[Ben Bass (actor)|Ben Bass]] as Placement Agent\n*[[Nicholas Campbell]] as Frankie Gooland\n*[[Siobhan Fallon Hogan|Siobhan Fallon]] as Charlotte\n*Jenny Robertson as Joyce Ives\n*[[Todd Louiso]] as Bob Harper\n*[[Skipp Sudduth]] as Jack Newbauer\n*[[Jennifer Irwin]] as Connie Harper\n*[[Aleksa Palladino]] as  Bonnie\n*[[Melanie Nicholls-King]] as Dallas Desk Clerk\n*[[Beth Littleford]] as Suzanne\n*[[Chris Bauer]] as Larry Ives\n*[[Janet Kidder]] as Crystal\n*[[John Lefebvre]] as Cob Whitman\n}}\n\n==Production==\nAuthor Michael Grant Jaffe first wrote the manuscript for his novel ''Dance Real Slow'' in the early 1990s while working as a reporter at ''[[Sports Illustrated]]''.<ref name=\"EW\" /> Before the novel was published in 1996, [[Fox 2000 Pictures|Fox 2000]] secured the movie rights for six figures.<ref name=\"EW\" /> Matthew McDuffie then adapted the book into a screenplay.
