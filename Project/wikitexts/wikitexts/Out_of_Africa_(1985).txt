The film is based loosely on the 1937 autobiographical book ''[[Out of Africa]]'' written by [[Isak Dinesen]] (the pseudonym of Danish author [[Karen Blixen]]), with additional material from Dinesen's 1960 book ''Shadows on the Grass'' and other sources.\n\nThe book was [[Film adaptation|adapted into a screenplay]] by the writer Kurt Luedtke, and filmed in 1984. Streep played Karen Blixen, Redford played [[Denys Finch Hatton]], and [[Klaus Maria Brandauer]] played Baron [[Bror von Blixen-Finecke|Bror Blixen]]. Others in the film include [[Michael Kitchen]] as Berkeley Cole, Malick Bowens as Farah, Stephen Kinyanjui as the Chief, [[Michael Gough]] as [[Hugh Cholmondeley, 3rd Baron Delamere|Lord Delamere]], [[Suzanna Hamilton]] as Felicity, and the model and actress [[Iman (model)|Iman]] as Mariammo. The film received generally positive reviews from critics. It was also a commercial success and won seven [[Academy Awards]] including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]] and [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]] for Pollack.\n\n==Plot==\nKaren Blixen recalls her life in Africa where she moved in 1913 as an unmarried wealthy Dane. After having been spurned by her Swedish nobleman lover, she asks his brother, Baron [[Bror von Blixen-Finecke|Bror Blixen]], to marry out of mutual convenience, and they move to the vicinity of [[Nairobi]], [[East Africa Protectorate|British East Africa]].  Using her funds, he is to set up a dairy ranch, with her joining him a few months later, at which time they will marry. En route to Nairobi, her train is hailed by a [[big-game hunter]] named [[Denys Finch Hatton]], who knows her fianc\u00e9 and entrusts his haul of ivory to her.\n\nShe is greeted at the railway station by Farah, the [[Somalis|Somali]] headman hired by Bror, who is nowhere to be found. She is taken to the recently founded [[Muthaiga Country Club|Muthaiga Club]]. She enters the men-only salon to ask for her husband and, because of her gender, is asked to leave. Karen and Bror marry before the day is out, and she becomes Baroness Blixen.\n\nShe then learns that Bror has changed their agreed-upon plan, and has spent her money to establish a coffee farm. She quickly learns that the farm is at too high an elevation to offer much of a chance of success. She needs Bror's help in building and managing this farm, but his interest is more in guiding game hunting safaris than in farming.\n\nKaren comes to love Africa and the African people, and is taken in by the breathtaking view of the nearby [[Ngong Hills]] and the [[Great Rift Valley]] beyond. Meanwhile, she looks after the [[Kikuyu people]] who are squatting on her land. Among other things, she establishes a school, helps with their medical needs, and arbitrates their disputes. She also attempts to establish a formal European homelife on par with the other upper class colonists in the area. Meanwhile, she becomes friends with a young woman, Felicity (whose character is based on a young [[Beryl Markham]]). Eventually, Karen and Bror develop feelings for each other. But Bror continues to pursue other sexual relationships because their marriage is still a partnership based on convenience.\n\nAs the [[First World War]] reaches East Africa, the colonists form a [[militia]] led by the colonial [[patriarch]] [[Hugh Cholmondeley, 3rd Baron Delamere|Lord Delamere]], which includes Denys and Bror among their number. A military expedition sets out in search of the forces from the neighboring German colony of [[German East Africa]]. Responding to the militia's need for supplies, Karen leads a difficult expedition to find them and returns safely. Shortly after the end of the war, in the evenings, Karen makes up exotic and imaginative stories to entertain her visitors.\n\nKaren discovers that Bror has given her [[syphilis]]. As she is unable to receive proper treatment in Nairobi, she returns to Denmark for treatment and recuperation. Bror agrees to manage the farm while she is away. When she returns, now unable to bear children, Bror resumes his safari work and they begin to live separately.\n\nThe relationship between Karen and Denys develops, and he comes to live with her. Denys acquires a [[de Havilland DH.60 Moth|Gipsy Moth]] biplane and often takes Karen flying. Karen and Bror get a divorce on the grounds of Bror's infidelity. When Karen learns that Denys has taken one of her female acquaintances on a private safari, Karen comes to realize that Denys does not share her desire for a monogamous, domestic relationship. He assures her that when he is with her he wants to be with her, and states that a marriage is immaterial to their relationship. Eventually, this drives them apart and, refusing to be tied down, he moves out.\n\nThe farm eventually yields a good harvest, but a fire destroys much of the farm and factory, forcing her to sell out. She prepares for her departure from [[Kenya Colony|Kenya]] to Denmark by appealing to the incoming governor to provide land for her Kikuyu workers to allow them to stay together, and by selling most of her remaining possessions at a [[rummage sale]].  Denys visits the now-empty house and Karen comments that the house should have been (empty) all-along and, as with her other efforts, the returning of things to their natural state is as it should be. Denys says that he was just getting used to her things.\n\nAs he is about to depart for a safari scouting trip in his airplane, they agree that the following Friday he will return and fly her to [[Mombasa]]; with Karen then continuing on to Denmark. Friday comes and Denys does not appear. Bror then arrives to tell her that Denys' [[biplane]] has crashed and burned in [[Tsavo]].  During Denys' funeral, Karen recites an excerpt of a poem by [[A. E. Housman]] about a lauded athlete dying young who, as with Denys, is not fated to decline into old age. Later, as she is about to depart, she goes to the Muthaiga Club to complete arrangements for forwarding any mail. The members, having come to admire her, invite her into the men-only salon for a toast. At the railway station, she gives Farah the compass that Denys had given to her, and says goodbye to Farah, then turns back to ask him to say her name so she can hear his voice one last time. Later, Farah writes to Karen in Denmark, telling her that a pair of lions often visit Denys' grave.\n\nAs the movie ends, the on-screen narrative notes that Karen later became a published author under the pen name Isak Dinesen. Among her work is the memoir about her experiences in Africa, ''[[Out of Africa]]'', the first line from which is used to introduce this film. She never returned to Africa.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Robert Redford]] as [[Denys Finch Hatton]]\n* [[Meryl Streep]] as [[Karen Blixen|Baroness Karen von Blixen (n\u00e9e Dinesen)]]\n* [[Klaus Maria Brandauer]] as [[Bror von Blixen-Finecke|Baron Bror von Blixen]] and [[Hans von Blixen-Finecke|Baron Hans von Blixen]]\n* [[Michael Kitchen]] as [[Reginald Berkeley Cole|Berkeley Cole]]\n* [[Shane Rimmer]] as Belknap\n* Malick Bowens as Farah Aden\n* Joseph Thiaka as Kamante\n* Stephen Kinyanjui as Chief Kinanjui\n* [[Michael Gough]] as [[Hugh Cholmondeley, 3rd Baron Delamere|Hugh Cholmondeley, Lord Delamere]]\n* [[Suzanna Hamilton]] as Felicity Spurway\n* [[Rachel Kempson]] as Sarah, Lady Belfield\n* [[Graham Crowden]] as Henry, Lord Belfield\n* [[Leslie Phillips]] as [[Joseph Aloysius Byrne|Sir Joseph Aloysius Byrne]]\n* [[Annabel Maule]] as Lady Byrne\n* [[Donal McCann]] as Doctor in Nairobi\n* [[Benny Young]] as Minister\n* [[Iman (model)|Iman]] as Mariammo\n* [[Job Seda]] as Kanuthia\n}}\n\n==Production==\nThe film tells the story as a series of six loosely coupled episodes from Karen's life, intercut with her narration. The final two narrations, the first a reflection on Karen's experiences in Kenya and the second a description of Finch Hatton's grave, were taken from her book ''[[Out of Africa]]'', while the others were written for the film in imitation of her very lyrical writing style. The pace of this film is often rather slow, reflecting Blixen's book, \"Natives dislike speed, as we dislike noise...\"<ref>''[[Out of Africa]]'', p. 252</ref>\n\n[[Klaus Maria Brandauer]] was director Sydney Pollack's only choice for Bror Blixen, even having trouble to pick a replacement when it appeared that Brandauer's schedule would prevent him from participating. [[Robert Redford]] became Finch Hatton, with Pollack thinking Redford had a charm no British actor could convey. [[Meryl Streep]] landed the part by showing up for her meeting with the director wearing a low-cut blouse and a [[push-up bra]], as Pollack had originally thought the actress did not have enough sex appeal for the role.<ref>\"Song of Africa\", ''Out of Africa'' DVD</ref>\n\n''Out of Africa'' was filmed using descendants of several people of the Kikuyu tribe who are named in the book, including the grandson of chief Kinyanjui who played his grandfather. Much of it was filmed in the [[Karen, Kenya|Karen]] / [[Lang'ata]] area near the actual [[Ngong Hills]] outside Nairobi. The [[Chyulu Hills]] stood in for the less picturesque Ngong Hills. As Karen's farmhouse was at the time of filming a part of a local nursing school, the filming took place in her nearby first house \"Mbogani\", which is a dairy today. Her actual house, known as \"Mbagathi\" is now the [[Karen Blixen Museum (Kenya)|Karen Blixen Museum]]. A substantial part of the filming took place in the Scott house and in a recreation of 1910s Nairobi built in an area of unoccupied land in Langata.\n\nThe scenes depicting the [[Government Houses of the British Empire and Commonwealth|Government House]] were shot at [[Nairobi School]] with the administration block providing a close replica of British colonial governors' residences.<ref>{{Cite web|title = The thinking behind Nairobi's grand schools|url = http://www.nation.co.ke/Features/DN2/The-thinking-behind-Nairobis--grand-schools-/-/957860/1625562/-/128vpwfz/-/index.html|website = www.nation.co.ke|access-date = 2015-11-05}}</ref> The train sequences were filmed along a section of abandoned track some {{convert|97|km|abbr=on}} from Nairobi. The scenes set in [[Denmark]] were actually filmed in [[Surrey]], [[England]].\n\n==Historical differences==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2018}}\nAlthough bearing the name of Dinesen's book, the picture was actually taken from two other books (not written by her) as well.  It quotes the start of the Dinesen's book, \"I had a farm in Africa, at the foot of the Ngong Hills\" [p.&nbsp;3], and Karen recites, \"He prayeth well that loveth well both man and bird and beast\" from ''[[The Rime of the Ancient Mariner]]'', which becomes the epitaph inscribed on Finch Hatton's grave marker [p.&nbsp;370].\n\nThe film omits much of Dinesen's book, such as a devastating locust swarm, some local shootings, and her writings about the German army. The production also plays down the size of her {{convert|4,000|acre|km2}} farm, which had 800 [[Kikuyu people|Kikuyu]] workers and an 18-oxen wagon. Scenes show Karen as owning only one dog, but actually, she had two similar dogs named Dawn and Dusk.\n\nThe movie also takes liberties with Denys and Karen's romance. They met at a hunting club, not in the plains. Denys was away from Kenya for two years on military assignment in [[Egypt]], which is not mentioned. Denys took up flying and began to lead [[safari]]s after he moved in with Karen. The film also ignores that Karen was pregnant at least once with Finch Hatton's child but suffered from [[miscarriage]]s. Furthermore, Denys was an English aristocrat, but this fact was minimized by the hiring of the actor [[Robert Redford]], an inarguably all-American actor who had previously worked with Pollack. When Redford accepted the contract to play, he did so fully intending to play him as an Englishman. Pollack, however, felt an English accent would be distracting for the audience, and told Redford to use his real accent. In fact, Redford reportedly had to re-record some of his lines from early takes in the filming, in which he still spoke with a trace of English accent.\n\nThe title scenes of the film show the main railway, from [[Mombasa]] to [[Nairobi]], as traveling through the [[Kenyan Rift Valley]], on the steep back side of the actual [[Ngong Hills]]. However, the real railway track is located on the higher, opposite side of the Ngong Hills. The passenger car was actually a small combination office/sleeper that was originally used by supervisors during the building of the [[Uganda Railway]] and was the actual car from which a man was taken and killed by a marauding lioness.\n\n==Soundtrack==\n{{Infobox album\n| name       = Out of Africa\n| type       = soundtrack\n| artist     = [[John Barry (composer)|John Barry]]\n| cover      =\n| alt        =\n| released   = 1985 (US) / 1986 (UK)\n| recorded   = 1985\n| venue      =\n| studio     =\n| genre      = soundtrack\n| length     = 12 at 33:27<br>18 at 38:42\n| label      = [[MCA Records]]<br>[[Var\u00e8se Sarabande]]\n| producer   =\n| prev_title =\n| prev_year  =\n| next_title =\n| next_year  =\n}}\nThe music for ''Out of Africa'' was composed and conducted by veteran English composer [[John Barry (composer)|John Barry]].

In his director's notes, Pollack stated that prior to the filming of ''Out of Africa'', he made [[motion picture]]s exclusively in the anamorphic 2.39:1 widescreen format and style, and that he did not resume the [[Anamorphic format#2.39:1|anamorphic 2.39:1]] widescreen format, due to the rise of pan and scan which had affected the compositions of many anamorphic movies, until his last movie, ''[[The Interpreter]]'', in 2005.\n\n==Release==\n===Critical reception===\nOn [[review aggregator]] [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film holds an approval rating of 61% based on 88 reviews, with an average rating of 6.90/10.
