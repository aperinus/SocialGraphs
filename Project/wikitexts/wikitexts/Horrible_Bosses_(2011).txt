It stars [[Jason Bateman]], [[Charlie Day]], [[Jason Sudeikis]], [[Jennifer Aniston]], [[Colin Farrell]], [[Kevin Spacey]], and [[Jamie Foxx]]. The plot follows three friends, played by Bateman, Day, and Sudeikis, who decide to murder their respective overbearing, abusive bosses, portrayed by Spacey, Aniston, and Farrell.\n\nMarkowitz's script was bought by [[New Line Cinema]] in 2005 and the film spent six years in various states of pre-production, with a variety of actors attached to different roles. By 2010, Goldstein and Daley had rewritten the script, and the film finally went into production.\n\nThe film premiered in [[Los Angeles]] on June&nbsp;30, 2011, and was released on July&nbsp;8, 2011. The film exceeded financial expectations, accruing over $28&nbsp;million in the first three days, making it the number two film in the United States during its opening weekend. The film grossed over $209&nbsp;million worldwide by the end of its theatrical run.\n\nThe film received generally mixed-to-positive reviews, with critics praising the [[ensemble cast]], and each lead being singled out for their performances across reviews. Some reviewers gave praise to the premise and plot, while others commented on the quality of the joke-writing.<ref name=\"ReviewSalon\" /><ref name=\"ReviewIndependent\" /> A sequel, ''[[Horrible Bosses 2]]'', was released on November 26, 2014.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- PER WP:FILMPLOT, PLOT SUMMARIES FOR FEATURE FILMS SHOULD BE BETWEEN 400 AND 700 WORDS. -->\n\nNick Hendricks and Dale Arbus are friends who despise their bosses. Nick works at a financial firm for the [[sadistic personality disorder|sadistic]] Dave Harken, who hints at a possible promotion for Nick for months, only to award it to himself. Dale is a dental assistant being [[Sexual harassment|sexually harassed]] by his boss, Dr. Julia Harris, who threatens to tell his fianc\u00e9e Stacy that he had sex with her unless he actually has sex with her. Nick and Dale's friend, accountant Kurt Buckman, enjoys working for Jack Pellit at a chemical company, but after Jack unexpectedly dies of a heart attack, the company is taken over by Jack's [[cocaine]]-addicted son Bobby, whose apathy and incompetence threaten the future of the company.\n\nAt night, over drinks, Kurt jokingly suggests that their lives would be happier if their bosses were no longer around. Initially hesitant, they eventually agree to kill their employers. In search of a [[hitman]], the trio meet Dean \"Motherfucker\" Jones, an ex-con who agrees to be their \"murder consultant.\" Jones suggests that Nick, Kurt, and Dale kill each other's bosses to hide their motivations, while making the deaths look like accidents.\n\nThe three reconnoiter Bobby's house, and Kurt steals his phone. They next go to Harken's house, where Kurt and Nick go inside while Dale waits in the car. Harken returns home and confronts Dale for littering, but then has an allergy attack from the peanut butter on the litter. Dale saves Harken by stabbing him with an [[EpiPen]]. Nick and Kurt think Dale is stabbing Harken to death and flee, with Kurt accidentally dropping Bobby's phone in Harken's bedroom. The next night, Kurt watches Julia's home, but she seduces and has sex with him. Nick and Dale wait outside Bobby's and Harken's houses, respectively, to commit the murders. Harken discovers Bobby's phone in his bedroom and uses it to find his address, suspecting his wife Rhonda is having an affair. He drives over and kills Bobby, while Nick secretly witnesses the murder.\n\nNick flees at high speed, setting off a [[traffic camera]]. The trio meet to discuss their reservations about continuing with their plan. They are questioned by the police, who believe the camera footage makes them suspects in Bobby's murder. Lacking evidence, the police are forced to let the trio go free. The trio consult with Jones again, but learn that he never actually killed anyone, having been imprisoned for [[bootleg recording|bootlegging]] [[Snow Falling on Cedars (film)|a movie]]. Jones suggests that they get Harken to confess and secretly tape it. The three accidentally crash Harken's surprise birthday party, where Nick and Dale get Harken to confess to the murder before realizing that Kurt, who has the audio recorder, is elsewhere having sex with Rhonda. Harken threatens to kill all three for attempting to [[blackmail]] him. They flee by car, but Harken gives chase and repeatedly rams their vehicle.\n\nBelieving they have committed a crime, the car's navigation-system operator remotely disables Kurt's car, allowing Harken to catch and hold them at gunpoint. Harken shoots himself in the leg as he boasts about his plan to frame them for murdering Bobby and attempting to kill him to get rid of the witness. The police initially arrest Nick, Dale and Kurt, but the navigation-system operator, Gregory, reveals that it is his company's policy to record all conversations for quality assurance. Gregory plays the tape that has Harken confessing to Bobby's murder. Harken is sentenced to 25 years to life in prison, while the friends get their charges waived. Nick is promoted to president of the company with a raise under a nice, but crazy CEO, Kurt remains in his position under a promoted co-worker, and Dale, with the help of Jones, blackmails Julia into ending her harassment.\n<!-- PER WP:FILMPLOT, PLOT SUMMARIES FOR FEATURE FILMS SHOULD BE BETWEEN 400 AND 700 WORDS. -->\n\n==Cast==\n{{multiple image\n| direction = vertical\n| width     = 175\n| footer    = Top to bottom: Aniston, Farrell and Spacey, who portray the titular bosses.\n| image1    = JenniferAnistonFeb09.jpg\n| alt1      = \n| caption1  = \n| image2    = Colin Farrell by Gage Skidmore.jpg\n| alt2      = \n| caption2  = \n| image3    = Kevin Spacey @ San Diego Comic-Con 2008 - b.jpg\n| alt3      = \n| caption3  = \n}}\n\n* [[Jason Bateman]] as Nick Hendricks\n:An executive at a financial firm who is manipulated into jumping through hoops in order to get a promotion that his boss never intended to give him.<ref name=\"markowitzcharacters\"/> Markowitz wrote the role specifically for Bateman.<ref name=\"AnistonCharacter\"/>\n\n:\n* [[Charlie Day]] as Dale Arbus\n:A dental assistant who is sexually harassed by his boss.<ref name=\"markowitzcharacters\" /> Described as a \"hopeless romantic\" in love with his fianc\u00e9e.<ref name=\"ProductionNotes\"/> Day was considered for the role following his co-starring performance with Sudeikis in the 2010 film ''[[Going the Distance (2010 film)|Going the Distance]]'', a performance which [[Reuters]] reported that industry insiders believed overshadowed the main stars.<ref name=\"earlyCasting\" />\n*[[Jason Sudeikis]] as Kurt Buckman<ref name=\"SlashFilmCasting\" />\n:An account manager at a chemical company dealing with a new, drug-addicted boss after his beloved former boss dies.<ref name=\"SFCasting\" /> Sudeikis was cast in May 2010.<ref name=\"SudeikisCasting\" />\n* [[Jennifer Aniston]] as Dr. Julia Harris, D.D.S.\n:Markowitz based the character on a former boss, claiming she was \"very sexually aggressive with everybody\".

Each environment is a reflection of the person who controls it.\"|source=\u2013 Production designer Shepherd Frankel on the approach to set design.<ref name=\"ProductionNotes\" />|style=padding:10px; background-color: #EFEFEF;}}\nProduction designer Shepherd Frankel specifically set out to create distinctly different environments for the three employees and their respective bosses' homes and offices. Nick and Harken's workplace is the \"Comnidyne\" bullpen, which was designed to \"enhance the discomfort and anxiety of lower-level employees clustered in the center of the room where every movement is monitored by the boss from his corner office.\" The design team met with financial strategists and management companies to learn about the architecture of their office layouts to visually represent the experience of starting from a low-ranking position in a cubicle and aspiring to an office. Costume designer Carol Ramsey worked with Frankel and set decorator [[Jan Pascale]] to match Harken's suit to that of the surrounding \"cold grey and blue\" color palette of his office. Harken's home was described as \"equally lacking in warmth\" as the office but more lavishly decorated and \"for show\", including an intentionally oversized portrait of him with his \"trophy wife\".<ref name=\"ProductionNotes\" />\n\nDesigning Julia's office was described as a \"challenge\", infusing a \"sensual vibe\" into a dental office. Frankel approached the design through Julia's mentality, stating, \"She's a Type A professional at the top of her game, who likes to play cat-and-mouse, so it's a completely controlled environment, with apertures and views into other rooms so she always knows what's going on\". \"It's highly designed, with rich wallpaper and tones, sumptuous artwork and subtle lighting\u2014all very\ndisarming till you step into her private office. The blinds close, the door locks and you think, 'It's the Temple of Doom.'\" Similarly approaching the character's home, the design allowed for wide windows which face onto a public street \"which afford her the opportunity to put on the kind of show she couldn't get away with at work.\"<ref name=\"ProductionNotes\" />\n\nBobby's environments were designed with more contrast, the character being new to the work area. Frankel described the contrast as \"the company reflects [Jack Pellitt's] human touch, whereas [Bobby Pellitt's] home is a shameless shrine to himself and his hedonistic appetites.\" Frankel continued, \"It features a mishmash of anything he finds exotic and erotic, mostly Egyptian and Asian motifs with an '80s [[Studio 54]] vibe, a makeshift dojo, lots of mirrors and a massage table.\" Some parts of the house design were provided by Farrell and Gordon's interpretation of the character and his \"infatuation\" with martial arts and \"his delusions of prowess\".<ref name=\"ProductionNotes\" />\n\n===Filming===\nFilming of ''Horrible Bosses'' took place in and around [[Los Angeles]].<ref name=\"FilmingLocPop\" /> The production team attempted to find locations \"that people haven't already seen a hundred times in movies and on TV\", aiming for the film to appear as if it could be taking place anywhere in America \"where people are trying to pursue the American dream but getting stopped by a horrible boss.\" \"Comnidyine\" was represented by an office building in [[Torrance, California]], with the crew building the set on a vacant floor.<ref name=\"ProductionNotes\" /> For \"Pellitt Chemical\", the production team found a \"perfect landscape of pipes and containers\" in [[Santa Fe Springs]], surrounding an unoccupied water cleaning and storage facility. To take advantage of the surrounding imagery, the warehouse required an extensive series of overhauls, including cutting windows into concrete walls and creating new doorways to allow for visuals of the warehouse exterior and provide a setting for the final scene of Sutherland's character.<ref name=\"ProductionNotes\" /> A [[T.G.I. Friday's]] in [[Woodland Hills, Los Angeles]], was used as a bar frequented by Nick, Dale, and Kurt, while the bar scene where they meet with Jones was staged in downtown Los Angeles.<ref name=\"ProductionNotes\" />\n\nThe film was shot [[digital cinematography|digitally]] using the [[Genesis (Panavision)|Panavision Genesis]] camera.<ref name=\"DigitalShooting\" /> Gordon encouraged the actors to improvise, though Aniston claimed to not have taken advantage of the offer as much as her co-stars, stating, \"My dialogue was just so beautifully choreographed that there wasn\u2019t much that I needed to do\".<ref name=\"AnistonImprovisation\" />\n\n===Music===\nThe soundtrack was composed by award-winning composer [[Christopher Lennertz]], with music contributed by [[Mike McCready]] of [[Pearl Jam]], [[Stefan Lessard]] of [[Dave Matthews Band]] and [[Money Mark]]\u2014a collaborator with the [[Beastie Boys]].<ref name=\"soundtrack\" /> McCready, Lessard, and Mark worked with musicians [[Matt Chamberlain]], David Levita, Aaron Kaplan, [[Victor Indrizzo]], [[Chris Chaney]], Davey Chegwidden and [[DJ Cheapshot]]<ref name=\"MusicPressRelease\" /> to develop the music.<ref name=\"soundtrack\" /> Major contributions were provided by Mark on keyboard, McCready and Levita on guitar, Chaney and Lessard on bass, Indrizzo on drums and DJ Cheapshot on turntables.\n\nLennertz recorded the soundtrack at [[The Village (studio)|The Village]] recording studio in West Los Angeles and [[Capitol Records]]. Lennertz attempted to remain \"authentic\" to the characters' progression from average worker to calculated killer. To achieve this aim, he decided against recording digitally, instead recording the tracks on two-inch [[Magnetic tape sound recording|analog tape]], intending each musical cue to sound as if it was emanating from a [[Gramophone record|vinyl record]].<ref name=\"MusicPressRelease\" /> He explained, \"The idea was to put together a band that would record the score together the same way that they would make an album. It isn't over-produced or shiny and digital in any way. It's brash, noisy, and full of bravado and swagger. I knew that if we could harness some of this sonic magic in the score, then the toughness and confidence of the music would play against Bateman, Sudeikis, and Charlie Day to really emphasize and elevate the humor in the situations that transpire.\"<ref name=\"MusicPressRelease\" /> Lennertz continued, \"We tracked through tape before [[Pro Tools]] to get that fat sound, and made every choice based on feel rather than perfection. We even used the same [[Wurlitzer]] that Money Mark played on Beck's classic \u2018[[Where It's At (Beck song)|Where It's At]]\u2019. At the end of the day, Seth [Gordon] and I wanted to produce a score that is as irreverent and full of attitude as the movie itself. I think we did it...and most of all, everyone had a blast in the process.\"<ref name=\"MusicPressRelease\" />\n\n''Horrible Bosses: The Original Motion Picture Soundtrack'' was released in physical

The website's critical consensus reads, \"It's nasty, uneven, and far from original, but thanks to a smartly assembled cast that makes the most of a solid premise, ''Horrible Bosses'' works.\"<ref name=\"RottenTomatoScore\" /> Review aggregate [[Metacritic]] gave the film a score of 57 out of 100, based on 40 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".<ref name=\"MetacriticScore\" /> On [[CinemaScore]], audiences gave the film an average grade of \"B+\" on an A+ to F scale.<ref name=\"CinemaScore\"/> Male audience members gave the film an \"A\u2212\" compared to females giving it an average rating of \"B+\".<ref name=\"CinemaScore2\"/>\n\n[[Roger Ebert]] gave the film three and a half stars out of&nbsp;four, calling it \"well-cast\" and commending it for playing to each actor's strengths. Ebert gave particular praise to Spacey, labeling him \"superb\", and Aniston, judging her performance to be a \"surprise\" and a return to form, stating \"she has acute comic timing and hilariously enacts alarming sexual hungers\". Ebert called ''Horrible Bosses'' \"cheerful and wicked\".<ref name=\"ReviewEbert\" /> Lisa Schwarzbaum of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' reacted positively, calling the film \"a&nbsp;bouncy, well-built, delightfully nasty tale of resentment, desperation, and amoral revenge\" and complimented the casting of the protagonists and antagonists.<ref name=\"ReviewEW\" /> ''[[The A.V. Club]]''{{'}}s [[Nathan Rabin]] also praised the cast, stating that the picture \"succeeds almost entirely on the chemistry of its three leads, who remain likeable even while resorting to homicide\", adding the \"acting more than compensates for the film's other failings.\" Rabin singled out Day's performance as \"a&nbsp;potent illustration of how a brilliant character actor with a spark of madness can elevate a ramshackle lowbrow farce into a solid mainstream comedy through sheer force of charisma.\"<ref name=\"ReviewAVClub\" /> Edward Douglas of [[ComingSoon.net]] credited director Seth Gordon with having assembled \"the perfect cast\", claiming \"the six leads kill in every scene\", but echoed Nathan Rabin's sentiments that Day is the \"real standout\". Douglas summarized the picture as \"dark fun that works better than expected due to a well-developed script, an impeccable cast and a director who knows how to put the two together\".<ref name=\"ReviewComingSoon\" /> [[A. O. Scott]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' stated \"the timing of the cast...is impeccable\" and appreciated that the script did not attempt \"to cut its coarseness with a hypocritical dose of sweetness or respectability\". The review concluded that \"in the ways that count and even when it shouldn\u2019t, ''Horrible Bosses'' works.\"<ref name=\"ReviewNYT\" />\n\n''[[USA Today]]''{{'}}s Scott Bowles awarded the film three out of four stars, labeling it a \"surprising comedy that rivals ''[[Bridesmaids (2011 film)|Bridesmaids]]'' as the funniest film of the summer, if not the year.\" Bowles added that \"the characters are so likable\", giving particular credit to Sudeikis though also adding praise for the performances of Bateman and Day. The dialogue was also lauded by Bowles, which commented that \"Seth Gordon has a deft touch with water-cooler talk\u2014even when the water cooler might be spiked with poison.\"<ref name=\"ReviewUSAToday\" /> [[Leonard Maltin]] of [[indieWire]] considered Day to have had the \"breakout role\" and offered praise to the performances of the cast, but lamented the lack of screen time for Farrell's character. Maltin concluded \"the movie has just enough raunchiness to identify it as a 2011 comedy, just enough cleverness to admire, and just the right camaraderie among its three male stars, which turns out to be the movie\u2019s greatest strength.\"<ref name=\"ReviewMaltin\" /> ''[[Rolling Stone]]''{{'}}s [[Peter Travers]] gave kudos to the \"killer cast\", with specific credit given to Bateman and Day, but was critical of the movie, stating \"it wussies out on a sharp premise\" and that it is a \"hit-and-miss farce that leaves you wishing it was funnier than it is\"<ref name=\"ReviewRollingStone\" /> ''[[The Guardian]]''{{'}}s Philip French called ''Horrible Bosses'' \"a&nbsp;lumbering, misogynistic affair\", but admitted \"I&nbsp;laughed frequently, probably to the detriment of my self-respect.\"<ref name=\"ReviewGuardian\" /> Nicholas Barber of ''[[The Independent]]'' gave a positive review, complimenting Gordon for not allowing the actors' improvisation to be detrimental to the pacing, but felt the movie was not as \"dark\" as its premise required, saying \"what edginess the film does have comes instead from the inordinate quantity of swearing, plus a smattering of homophobia and misogyny.\"<ref name=\"ReviewIndependent\" />\n\n''[[Salon.com|Salon]]''{{'}}s Andrew O'Hehir offered a mixed response, characterizing the film as a \"lot funnier in theory than in practice, but it won't ruin your Saturday night\". ''Salon'' appreciated the \"effortless comic chemistry\" between Sudeikis, Bateman and Day and singled out Bateman, Aniston and Spacey for their performances. O'Hehir was however critical of the perceived homophobia, sexism and racism.<ref name=\"ReviewSalon\" /> ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]''{{'}}s Kirk Honeycutt responded negatively, stating the jokes failed to be funny, stating \"Seth Gordon shows no flair for turning the absurdities and cartoonish characters in the script...into anything more than a collection of moments in search of laughs.\"<ref name=\"ReviewTHR\" /> Karina Longworth of ''[[The Village Voice]]'' was critical of the premise, which she felt lacked any legitimate \"rage\" against the characters' bosses, stating \"...there's every sign that, even without these particular emasculators, Dale, Kurt and Nick would still be\u2014for lack of a better word\u2014total pussies.\" Longworth felt that the humor was \"rarely actually laugh-out-loud funny, and never truly dark or daring\". She particularly criticized the all-white, male protagonists and a plot she deemed racist and filled with \"stereotypes\".<ref name=\"ReviewVillageVoice\" /> Justin Chang of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' praised the performance of the ensemble cast, but considered the plot to be \"predictably moronic, vulgar and juvenile\". Chang echoed the sentiments of ''The Village Voice'' in lamenting that the film failed to pursue the premise to \"darker, more daring territory\" and faulted it for falling back on \"over-the-top comic exaggeration\".<ref name=\"ReviewVariety\" />\n\n===Accolades===\nThe film received several award nominations, including a [[Satellite Award for Best Supporting Actor - Motion Picture|Satellite Award for Best Supporting Actor]] for Colin Farrell,<ref name=\"AccoSatellite\" /> and three nominations from the 2012 [[The Comedy Awards|Comedy Awards]], including Comedy Actor for Bateman, Comedy Actress for Aniston, and best Comedy Film.<ref name=\"AccoComedy\" /> Farrell and Aniston were both nominated for Best On-Screen Dirt Bag at the 2012 [[MTV Movie Awards]], with Aniston claiming the award.
