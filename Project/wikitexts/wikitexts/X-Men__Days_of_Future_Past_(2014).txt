The film is based on the [[Marvel Comics]] [[superhero]] team The [[X-Men]], the fifth mainline installment of the [[X-Men (film series)|''X-Men'' film series]], a sequel to ''[[X-Men: The Last Stand]]'' (2006) and ''[[X-Men: First Class]]'' (2011), a follow-up to ''[[The Wolverine (film)|The Wolverine]]'' (2013), and the seventh installment overall. It stars an [[ensemble cast]], including [[Hugh Jackman]], [[James McAvoy]], [[Michael Fassbender]], [[Jennifer Lawrence]], [[Halle Berry]], [[Anna Paquin]], [[Elliot Page]],{{efn|name=Elliot}} [[Peter Dinklage]], [[Ian McKellen]], and [[Patrick Stewart]]. The story, inspired by the 1981 ''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'' storyline \"[[Days of Future Past]]\" by [[Chris Claremont]] and [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]], focuses on two time periods, with [[Logan (film series character)|Logan]] traveling back in time to 1973 to change history and prevent an event that results in unspeakable destruction for both humans and mutants.\n\nVaughn had directed ''[[X-Men: First Class]]'' and was set to return in ''Days of Future Past'' before leaving for ''[[Kingsman: The Secret Service]]'' and the 2015 version of ''[[Fantastic Four (2015 film)|Fantastic Four]]''. Thus Singer, who had directed the first two ''X-Men'' films, made his return as a director, and brought along most of the crew from those productions. With a budget of $205&nbsp;million [[principal photography]] began in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]] in April 2013 and concluded in August the same year, with additional filming and [[Pick-up (filmmaking)|pick-ups]] taking place in November 2013 and February 2014. Twelve companies handled the [[visual effects]].\n\n''X-Men: Days of Future Past'' premiered in New York City on May 10, 2014, and was theatrically released on May 23 by [[20th Century Fox]]. The film received praise for its story, visual effects, action sequences, acting, and thematic elements, with many considering it to be one of the best films in the franchise. During its theatrical run, the film earned over $746&nbsp;million worldwide, making it the [[2014 in film#Highest-grossing films|sixth-highest-grossing film of 2014]], as well as the third-highest- grossing film in the series behind ''[[Deadpool (film)|Deadpool]]'' and ''[[Deadpool 2]]''. The film received an [[87th Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Visual Effects|Best Visual Effects]], making it the first ''X-Men'' film to be nominated for an Oscar. A sequel, titled ''[[X-Men: Apocalypse]]'', was released on May 27, 2016.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/release-date-announced-x-men-663154 |title=Release Date Announced for X-Men: Apocalypse |last1=Ford| first1=Rebecca| first2=Borys |last2=Kit|date=December 5, 2013 |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |access-date=May 25, 2016 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20141027111510/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/release-date-announced-x-men-663154 | archive-date= October 27, 2014| url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n== Plot ==\n<!-- As per WP:FILMPLOT, limit plot summaries for featured film articles between 400 and 700 words. -->\nIn a dystopian future, [[Sentinel (comics)|Sentinels]] have been programmed to identify and hunt down [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutants]] and any humans who help them. In [[Moscow]], they attack a small band of X-Men survivors consisting of [[Kitty Pryde]], [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]], [[Blink (comics)|Blink]], [[Warpath (comics)|Warpath]], [[Bishop (comics)|Bishop]], [[Iceman (Marvel Comics)|Iceman]] and [[Sunspot (comics)|Sunspot]], who sacrifice themselves to give Kitty moments to send Bishop's consciousness [[Time travel|back in time]] a few days to warn the others as to ensure their survival.\n\nThe group retreats to a remote Chinese temple where they meet with [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]], [[Logan (film series character)|Wolverine]], [[Charles Xavier (film series character)|Professor Charles Xavier]], and [[Magneto (film series character)|Magneto]]. Xavier explains the history of the Sentinels, which were designed by [[Bolivar Trask]], a military scientist whom [[Mystique (comics)|Raven Darkh\u00f6lme]] assassinated in 1973. In response, government forces captured Raven and experimented on her, using her [[DNA]] to advance the Sentinel program, allowing Sentinels to adapt to nearly every mutant power. Xavier plans to go back in time and prevent Trask's assassination in hopes of changing their future, but since Xavier would not survive going back decades, Wolverine volunteers instead because his regenerative powers allow him to survive the process.\n\nAwakening in his younger body in 1973, Wolverine goes to the [[X-Mansion]], learning from [[Beast (comics)|Hank McCoy]] that the school has been closed for years due to many students and staff being drafted into the [[Vietnam War]], and Lehnsherr (Magneto) being falsely arrested for assassinating fellow mutant [[John F. Kennedy]]. A young, broken Xavier turned to [[alcoholism]] and frequently uses a specialized serum that allows him to walk but suppresses his telepathic abilities. Hoping to reunite with Mystique, Xavier agrees to help Wolverine. Aided by the newly recruited [[Peter Maximoff]], the trio infiltrate and break Lehnsherr out of [[The Pentagon]].\n\nRaven discovers Trask has been experimenting on mutants, and in revenge, she plots to assassinate him at the [[Paris Peace Accords]], but Xavier, McCoy, and Logan foil her attempt. Lehnsherr attempts to kill Raven, believing this could prevent the Sentinel takeover. An alarmed McCoy fights him, allowing Raven to escape but publicly exposing the three as mutants. Trask takes advantage of this and successfully convinces President [[Richard Nixon]] to initiate the Sentinel program.\n\nLehnsherr retrieves his helmet from military custody, using it to block Xavier's psychic powers, and secretly takes control of Trask's Sentinel prototypes by infusing them with metal. Returning to the X-Mansion, Xavier abandons the serum, regaining his mutant power, and communicates with his future self, who inspires him to protect the relationship between mutants and humans. After Xavier uses his mutant-tracking computer [[Cerebro]] to find Mystique, he, McCoy and Logan travel to [[Washington, D.C.]] to stop Raven's continuing plan to assassinate Trask.\n\nAt a ceremony where Nixon unveils the Sentinels, the three search for the disguised Raven. Magneto appears, controlling the Sentinels, and barricades the [[White House]] within the outer structure of [[Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium]]. During the battle, Magneto impales Logan with rebar and throws him into the [[Potomac River]]. Nixon, Trask, and a disguised Raven retreat to the [[Presidential Emergency Operations Center|White House Bunker]], but Magneto rips reinforcing steel bars out of the building with the intention of killing Nixon. In the future, the X-Men make their last stand as an onslaught of Sentinels attack them. Many mutants perish while attempting to buy more time, with Magneto being seriously injured. In 1973, Raven, openly showing herself as a mutant, subdues Magneto with a plastic gun, saving Nixon and his cabinet. She goes to kill Trask but Xavier convinces Raven to spare him. As a mutant was publicly seen saving the president, the Sentinel program is decommissioned, altering history and erasing the future Sentinels from existence. The mutants in the past depart separately; Trask is later imprisoned for attempting to sell military secrets to foreign military officials.\n\nWolverine awakens at the school to find Iceman, Colossus, Kitty, Hank, Storm, [[Rogue (Marvel Comics)|Rogue]], [[Jean Grey]], [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops]] and Xavier alive. Logan asks Xavier for information about modern history from 1973 to the present, and, realizing that the Wolverine from the original timeline has returned, the professor assents. Back in 1973, the younger Logan is rescued by Raven, who is disguised as Major [[William Stryker]].\n\nIn a [[post-credits scene]] set in [[ancient Egypt]], a crowd is seen chanting to [[Apocalypse (comics)|En Sabah Nur]], who telekinetically elevates building blocks to build [[Egyptian pyramids|pyramids]], as [[Horsemen of Apocalypse|four horsemen]] observe him from afar.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Tall image|X-Men DOFP cast.jpg|150|590|The cast of ''X-Men: Days of Future Past'' promoting the film at the 2013 [[San Diego Comic-Con]].

almost the gateway to getting the look we like in film\". Sigel added that the Arri Alexa-M camera's small size was a big advantage to the film's main unit, which carried three 3D rigs. The film also used the Alexa XTs for the production's 2D work.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.arri.de/news/alexa-xt-on-x-men/ |title=ARRI Group: News |access-date=June 22, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140727192335/http://www.arri.de/news/alexa-xt-on-x-men/ |archive-date=July 27, 2014 |url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nProduction designer John Myhre said his work load was \"six months squeeze[d] down in to 3-4 months\", given the sets were massive but he did not have the usual time to design and build before principal photography began. The lue underground hallways and Cerebro sets were faithful recreations of the sets seen in the first ''X-Men'', albeit ransacked and damaged to imply the government had raided the mansion.<ref name=myrhe/> The sets had many hidden \"Xs\", including the staircase of the X-Mansion. Myrhe said he wanted to embrace the 1970s setting in the same way ''First Class'' embraced its 1960s setting,<ref name=\"Collider set visit\"/> and costume designer Louise Mingenbach also drew heavily from 1970s styles for the clothing seen in the 1973 scenes. Hoult wore corduroys, Jackman a wooden-paneled buckle and a peacock-print shirt, and McAvoy wore a brown leather jacket. Peters wore 1981-inspired clothing; this was Mingenbach's way of showing Quicksilver's irreverence for the exact time and place. In one scene, Mingenbach gave Fassbender as the younger Erik Lehnsherr a fedora as a nod to the one the character wore in the first X-Men film.<ref name=louise>{{cite web|url=https://www.gq.com/entertainment/fashion/201405/x-men-days-of-future-past-costumes |title=GQ+A with Louise Mingenbach: The Days of Future Past Costume Designer on X-Men |date=May 23, 2014| work= [[GQ (magazine)|GQ]] |access-date=June 22, 2014 |first=Phili|last= Stelios}}</ref> For the future period of the film, Mingenbach wanted a darker, slightly futuristic and tactical look for the characters. This included changing the suit Patrick Stewart had previously worn as Xavier to battle fatigues.<ref name=louise/>\n\nThe Sentinels had two separate versions, to depict how the earlier prototypes built by Trask in the 1970s evolved into the adaptable killing machines of the dystopian future.<ref name=sentinels>{{cite video|title=Sentinels: For a Secure Future|location=''X-Men: Days of Future Past'' Blu-ray|year=2014|publisher=20th Century Fox Home Entertainment|type=Featurette}}</ref> Singer described the 1973 version as \"a little fun and stylish but also a little retro\", with a key element being that they are made of plastic to be unaffected by Magneto's powers. Myhre used styles from molded plastics from the 1970s to design Sentinels from that period,<ref name=\"Collider set visit\"/> and cited inspiration from both the cars of the decade and \"those wonderful TV sets that were round with smoked glass panels\". The overall style was bulky to fit \"the traditional idea of a robot looks like\",<ref name=sentinels/> and drew the most from the comics version, such as the purple color and a humanoid shape, while trying to stand out on its own with its retro design.<ref name=\"Myhre Interview\">{{cite web|url=https://collider.com/johny-myhre-x-men-days-of-future-past-interview/ |title=John Myhre Talks X-Men Days of Future Past, Sentinels and Easter Eggs |first=Steve  |last=Weintraub|website=[[Collider (website)|Collider]] |access-date=June 24, 2014}}</ref> The robots' ability to fly was compared to a [[Harrier jump jet]], as the Sentinels had [[V/STOL|vertical takeoff]] and could glide. Life-sized Sentinels were built by [[Legacy Effects]] to be featured on the set, and had articulated joints to be fully poseable. The sound effects averted metallic noises, while adding [[Woofer|woof]] effects on the Sentinels' footsteps to display its weight on the ground.<ref name=sentinels/>\n\nOn the other hand, the future Sentinels would resemble \"giant versions of Mystique\" to show how their technological development was based on studying the shapeshifting mutant's DNA. Thus their design is sleek and feminine, with a body covered in mechanical scales that move during the process of adapting to a mutant's attack, while also featuring angular and dark faces to enhance the intimidation. The future robots would feature what Singer described as \"biomechanical technology to transform to adapt to other mutants, to take on their physicality and some of their powers to use against mutantkind\", which the director imagined to be fueled by [[nanotechnology]] and \"the ability to really change things almost at a molecular level\". The Sentinels' heads would also open up as an extra weapon, and for straighter combat the robots could create blades and spikes out of their limbs. The crackling sound of the robots' scales was made by rubbing riveted belts on [[shale]] rocks.<ref name=fxguide>{{cite web|url=http://www.fxguide.com/featured/future-threat-x-men-days-of-future-past/|title=Future threat \u2013 X-Men: Days of Future Past|work=Fxguide|first=Ian|last=Failes|date=May 27, 2014|access-date=October 16, 2014}}</ref><ref name=sentinels/>\n\nFor the future setting of the film, a set featuring a hillside monastery was built. Myhre was inspired by Chinese temples built on the sides of cliffs. The future set also featured a mixture of architectural styles from China, India, and Indonesia. Part of the set was a big wall, which was inspired by the [[Great Wall of China]].<ref name=\"Myhre Interview\"/>\n\n===Visual effects===\n''X-Men: Days of Future Past'' had 1,311 visual effects shots produced by twelve studios. Richard Stammer served as the overall effects supervisor based on his work for ''[[Prometheus (2012 film)|Prometheus]]''.<ref name=\"Richard Stammers\"/> The leading company was [[Moving Picture Company]], who created the future Sentinels and worked on the sequences involving the X-Jet and Cerebro's red virtual world.<ref name=\"Richard Stammers\"/> The Sentinels' scaled bodies were created by adapting a tool originally developed to create hair and fur, which would later evolve into creating a proxy representation of each individual scale as a \"[[hair follicle|follicle]]\".<ref name=fxguide/> Another major contributor was [[Digital Domain]], with effects from the 1973 portion that encompassed nearly a third of the work. These included the Sentinels, Mystique's transformations and eyes, and various digital environments. Digital augmentation turned a remote airstrip into a Vietnam prisoner camp and added Paris' famed [[mansard roof]]tops to the Montreal locations. The environment work based on Washington, D.C. required the team to study period references of the [[National Mall]] and [[White House]], and photograph almost all of RFK Stadium to create a detailed digital replica.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.artofvfx.com/?p=8066|title=X-MEN \u2013 DAYS OF FUTURE PAST: Lou Pecora \u2013 VFX |first=Vincent |last=Frei|work=Art of VFX|date=May 28, 2014|access-date=February 8, 2015}}</ref>\n[[Rising Sun Pictures]] created a sequence considered by many reviewers the centerpiece of the film's effects, where Quicksilver uses his super speed in the Pentagon kitchen. Depicting how, to a speedster, actions in real time come down to a virtual standstill, objects float around in [[slow motion]].

Here's Details!] Rama's Screen, June 22, 2015</ref>\n\nIn the ''Rogue Cut'', Rogue's role is more consequential, and the narrative is more complex: when Kitty Pryde is accidentally wounded after Wolverine's consciousness experiences a phase between past and future from seeing Stryker in 1973, Bobby Drake (Iceman) proposes breaking into the heavily guarded remains of Cerebro at the former X-Mansion, the one place where Xavier's mind cannot reach others from the outside, in order to rescue Rogue, who is being held captive there. Xavier, Magneto, and Iceman succeed in rescuing Rogue, but at the cost of Iceman's life. Rogue uses her power to take over for Kitty in regards to keeping Wolverine's mind in 1973, for the remaining time until the moment history is changed, with a suggestion that Wolverine is aware of the switch as he appears to feel Rogue's presence. The Sentinels are able to find the X-Men through a tracking device inside a Sentinel's hand that was severed from the X-Jet during their escape. In another major scene, Mystique stops at the X-Mansion the night before the Sentinel-unveiling ceremony, revisits her previous romance with Beast, and destroys Cerebro the following morning in order to prevent Xavier from finding her. A new mid-credits scene shows Bolivar Trask imprisoned at Magneto's former prison cell beneath the Pentagon for selling military secrets to foreign countries.\n\n==Reception==\n[[File:Fan BingBIng &
