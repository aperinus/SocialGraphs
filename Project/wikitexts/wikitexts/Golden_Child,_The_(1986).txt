The film stars [[Eddie Murphy]] as Chandler Jarrell, a Los Angeles social worker who is informed that he is \"[[The Chosen One (trope)|The Chosen One]]\", and is destined to save \"The Golden Child\", a kidnapped Tibetan boy with mystical powers who is said to be the savior of all humankind. Alongside Murphy, the film's cast includes [[Charlotte Lewis]] and [[Charles Dance]].\n\nRated PG-13,  Murphy's first film not to be rated R by the [[Motion Picture Association of America]] (MPAA), ''The Golden Child'' was produced and distributed by [[Paramount Pictures]]<ref name=\"Maslin\" /> and received a total [[Gross profit|gross]] of $79,817,937 at the United States domestic [[box office]].<ref name=\"numbers\" /><ref name=\"mojo\" />\n\n==Plot==\nIn a remote temple in Tibet, a young boy with mystical powers \u2013 the Golden Child \u2013 receives badges of station and demonstrates his power to the monks of the temple by reviving a dead [[eastern rosella]], which becomes a constant companion and [[familiar spirit|familiar]]. A mysterious man, Sardo Numspa, has his men break into the temple, slaughter the monks and abduct the boy.\n\nA young woman, Kee Nang, watches a [[Los Angeles]] TV show in which social worker Chandler Jarrell talks about his latest case, a missing girl named Cheryll Mosley. Kee seeks him out and informs him of the kidnapping of the Golden Child and that he is the \"chosen one\" who would save the Child. Chandler does not take this seriously, even after a bird begins following him, and him seeing an [[astral projection]] of the Child. The next day, Cheryll Mosley is found dead near an abandoned house smeared with Tibetan graffiti and a pot full of blood-soaked oatmeal. Kee reveals to Chandler that this house was a holding place for the Child and introduces him to Doctor Hong, a mystic expert, and Kala (a creature half dragon, half woman, who remains hidden behind a screen).\n\nChandler and Kee track down a [[Outlaw motorcycle club|motorcycle gang]], the Yellow Dragons, which Cheryll had joined, and Chinese restaurant owner Tommy Tong, a henchman of Numspa, to whom Cheryll had been \"sold\" for her blood, a way to make the Child vulnerable to earthly harm. However, Tong is killed by Numspa as a potential traitor. Numspa then communes with his master, a unseen powerful demon, who informs him of how to kill the child. Still not taking the case too seriously, Chandler is drawn by Numspa into a controlled dream, where he receives a burn mark on his arm. Numspa presents his demands: the Ajanti Dagger (a mystic weapon capable of killing the Child) in exchange for the boy. Chandler finally agrees to help, and he and Kee spend the night together.\n\nChandler and Kee travel to Tibet, where Chandler is swindled by an old amulet seller, later revealed as the High Priest of the temple where the dagger is kept hidden (and, subsequently, Kee's father). In order to obtain the knife, Chandler has to pass a test: an obstacle course in a bottomless cavern whilst carrying a glass of water without spilling a drop. With luck and wits, Chandler recovers the blade and even manages to bring it past customs into the United States.\n\nThat night, Numspa and his henchmen attack Chandler and Kee. The Ajanti Dagger is lost to the villains, and Kee takes a crossbow bolt meant for Chandler, dying in his arms while confessing her love for him. Doctor Hong and Kala offer him hope: as long as the sun shines upon Kee, the Child might be able to save her. With the help of the Child's familiar, Chandler locates Numspa's hideout, retrieves the dagger with the help of Til, one of Numspa's men converted to good by the Child, and frees the boy. When Chandler confronts Numspa, he reveals himself as a winged demon. Chandler and the Child escape, only to be trapped inside a warehouse. Chandler loses the dagger when the warehouse collapses, with Numspa buried under falling masonry.\n\nChandler and the Child head to Doctor Hong's shop, where Kee is being kept. As the two approach Kee's body, a badly injured but berserk Numspa attacks Chandler, but the amulet the Old Man sold Chandler protects him, then blasts the dagger from Numspa's hand. The Child uses his magic to place the dagger back into Chandler's hands, and Chandler stabs Numspa through the heart, destroying him. The Child then uses the last rays of sunlight and his powers to bring Kee back from the dead. The three later take a walk discussing the Child's return to Tibet.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Eddie Murphy]] as Chandler Jarrell\n* [[Charles Dance]] as Sardo Numspa\n* [[Charlotte Lewis]] as [[Kee Nang]]\n* J.

However, during post-production, Barry also left the project when both differences with the producers and [[test screening]] feedback presented considerable challenges for the composer.<ref name=\"Friendly\" /><ref name=\"afi\" /> The test audience reaction had led the producers replacing Barry's score with new music by [[Michel Colombier]] that, in contrast to Barry's work, was mostly \"[[synthpop]]\" (although there were some brief orchestral passages throughout). Some of Barry's [[musical cue]]s remain in the final cut of the film and one track, \"Wisdom of the Ages\", appeared on the first [[Soundtrack album|soundtrack]] release issued by [[Capitol Records]].\n\nIn 2011, La-La Land Records released a limited-edition 3-CD soundtrack set containing the entirety of both Barry's mostly unused score (on disc one), and Colombier's final theatrical score (on disc two), in addition to an exclusive Barry-composed song, sung by emerging composer [[Randy Edelman]].
