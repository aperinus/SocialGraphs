The film is based on the 1985 West End English translation of the [[Les Mis\u00e9rables (musical)|1980 French musical]] by Boublil and Sch\u00f6nberg, which itself is adapted from the 1862 French [[Les Mis\u00e9rables|novel of the same name]] by [[Victor Hugo]]. The film is a British-American venture distributed by [[Universal Pictures]]. The film stars an [[ensemble cast]] led by [[Hugh Jackman]], [[Russell Crowe]], [[Anne Hathaway]], [[Eddie Redmayne]], [[Amanda Seyfried]], [[Helena Bonham Carter]], and [[Sacha Baron Cohen]].\n\nSet in France during the early nineteenth century, the film tells the story of [[Jean Valjean]] who, while being hunted for decades by the ruthless policeman [[Javert]] after breaking parole, agrees to care for a factory worker's daughter. The story reaches resolution against the background of the [[June Rebellion]] of 1832.\n\nFollowing the release of the 1980 musical, a film adaptation was mired in \"development hell\" for over ten years, as the rights were passed on to several major studios, and various directors and actors considered. In 2011, producer [[Cameron Mackintosh]] sold the film rights to [[Eric Fellner]], who financed the film through Working Title Films. In June 2011, production of the film officially began, with Hooper and Mackintosh serving as director and producer, and the main characters were cast later that year. [[Principal photography]] began in March 2012, with a budget of $61{{nbsp}}million.<ref name=\"FirstDay\"/> Filming took place on locations in Greenwich, London, Chatham, Winchester, Bath, and Portsmouth, England; in [[Gourdon, Alpes-Maritimes|Gourdon, France]]; and on soundstages in [[Pinewood Studios]].\n\n''Les Mis\u00e9rables'' premiered at [[Leicester Square]] in London on 5 December 2012, and was theatrically released on 25 December 2012 in the United States and on 11 January 2013 in the United Kingdom.<ref name=\"premiere\"/><ref name=\"BOM\">{{cite web |url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=lesmiserables2012.htm |title=Les Mis\u00e9rables (2012) |work=Box Office Mojo |access-date=19 April 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"usreleasedate\"/> It grossed over $441{{nbsp}}million worldwide.

However, Crowe's performance as Javert was heavily criticized; his singing, in particular, was almost universally panned.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.broadwaytour.net/why-is-russell-crowe-so-reviled-in-les-miserables/ |title=Why is Russell Crowe so Reviled in 'Les Miserables'? |date=19 July 2015 |access-date=20 December 2021}}</ref> The film was nominated for eight awards at the [[85th Academy Awards]], winning three, and received [[List of accolades received by Les Mis\u00e9rables (2012 film)|numerous other accolades]].\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be set between 400 to 700 words! -->\nIn 1815, French prisoner [[Jean Valjean]] is released from the [[Bagne of Toulon]] after a nineteen-year sentence for stealing bread for his nephew. His [[parole]]d status prevents him from finding work or accommodation, but he is sheltered by the kindly [[Bishop Myriel|Bishop of Digne]]. Valjean attempts to steal his silverware and is captured by [[National Gendarmerie|police]], but the bishop claims he gave him the silver, and tells him to use it to begin an honest life. Moved, Valjean breaks his parole and assumes a new identity, intending to redeem others.\n\nEight years later, Valjean is a respected factory owner and mayor of [[Montreuil, Pas-de-Calais]]. He is startled when [[Javert]], formerly a Toulon prison guard, arrives as his new chief of police. Witnessing Valjean rescuing a worker trapped under a cart makes Javert suspect the former's true identity. Meanwhile, one of Valjean's workers, [[Fantine]], is fired by the foreman when she is revealed to have an illegitimate daughter, [[Cosette]], living with the greedy [[Th\u00e9nardier]] family, to whom Fantine sends her earnings.\n\nOut on the streets and increasingly unwell, Fantine sells her hair, teeth, and eventually her sexual favors to support Cosette. Javert arrests her when she attacks an abusive customer, but Valjean recognises her and takes her to the hospital. Learning that a man has been wrongly identified as him, Valjean reveals his identity to the court before returning to the dying Fantine, promising to care for Cosette. Javert arrives to arrest him but he escapes to the Th\u00e9nardiers' inn. Valjean pays Fantine's debts, then flees from Javert with Cosette. They hide in a [[convent]], aided by the worker he had rescued.\n\nNine years later, Valjean has become a [[philanthropist]] to the poor in [[Paris]]. [[Jean Maximilien Lamarque|General Lamarque]], the only government official sympathetic to the poor, dies, and the revolutionist group [[Friends of the ABC]] plot against the [[July Monarchy|monarchy]]. [[Marius Pontmercy]], a member of the Friends, falls in love with Cosette at first sight and asks [[\u00c9ponine]], the Th\u00e9nardiers' daughter, to find her. He and Cosette meet and confess their love; \u00c9ponine, herself in love with Marius, is heartbroken.\n\nTh\u00e9nardier attempts to rob Valjean's house, but \u00c9ponine stops him. Fearing Javert is near, Valjean plans to flee to [[England]] with Cosette. She leaves Marius a letter, which \u00c9ponine hides from him. During Lamarque's [[funeral procession]], the revolt begins and barricades are built across Paris. Javert poses as an ally to spy on the rebels, but the street urchin [[Gavroche]] exposes him as a policeman. During the first skirmish against the soldiers, \u00c9ponine takes a bullet for Marius and dies in his arms, giving him Cosette's letter and confessing her love. Marius' answer to Cosette is intercepted by Valjean, who joins the revolt to protect him.\n\nValjean offers to execute the imprisoned Javert, but releases him instead, pretending he shot him. By dawn, the soldiers storm the barricade and kill everyone except Marius and Valjean, who escape into the sewers. Th\u00e9nardier comes across an unconscious Marius and steals his ring, before Valjean threatens him into revealing the way out. Valjean finds Javert waiting for him, but seeing that Marius is close to death, he lets them go. Morally disturbed by the mercy of his nemesis and his own in return, Javert kills himself by throwing himself in the [[Seine]]. Marius recovers, traumatized by the death of his friends.\n\nMarius and Cosette are reunited but Valjean, concerned his past would threaten their happiness, makes plans to leave. He reveals his past to Marius, who promises to remain silent. At Marius and Cosette's wedding, the Th\u00e9nardiers crash the reception to blackmail him; Th\u00e9nardier claims he witnessed Valjean carrying a murdered corpse and shows the stolen ring, which Marius recognises as his own. Realizing Valjean saved him from the barricade, Marius forces Th\u00e9nardier to reveal where he is, and the Th\u00e9nardiers are thrown out of the wedding. At the convent, Cosette and Marius find the dying Valjean, who gives them letters of confession before dying peacefully. His spirit is guided by visions of Fantine and the Bishop to join \u00c9ponine, Gavroche and the Friends of the ABC in the afterlife.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Hugh Jackman]] as [[Jean Valjean]], a Frenchman released from [[Toulon]] [[Bagne of Toulon|prison]] after 19 years of imprisonment for stealing bread and attempting to escape the prison.<ref name=\"ComingSoon\"/> Around June 2011, Jackman met with producer [[Cameron Mackintosh]] to audition in New York.<ref name=\"THR\"/> To prepare for the role, Jackman lost {{convert|15|lbs}} and later regained {{convert|30|lbs}} to mirror his character's success.<ref name=\"THR\">{{cite news |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/les-miserables-anne-hathaway-russell-398099?page=2 |title=Inside the Fight to Bring ''Les Mis'' to the Screen |last=Galloway |first=Stephen |date=5 December 2012 |access-date=27 December 2012 |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]}}</ref> He avoided drinking [[coffee]], warmed up at least 15 minutes every day, kept [[Ricola]] lozenges, drank as much as seven litres of water per day, sat in steam three times a day, took cold baths and used a wet washcloth over his face while flying, citing the musical's original co-director [[Trevor Nunn]] for his training.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/envelope/moviesnow/la-en-les-miserables-hugh-jackman-20121227,0,3437263.story |title=''Les Miz'': Hugh Jackman prepped with weights, washcloths, desire |last=Dawn |first=Randie |date=27 December 2012 |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |access-date=27 December 2012}}</ref> He worked extensively with vocal coach [[Joan Lader]], and managed to extend his vocal range, which he originally categorised a high [[baritone]], up to [[tenor]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.vulture.com/2012/12/hugh-jackman-on-les-miz-and-his-javert-past.html |title=Hugh Jackman on Les Mis\u00e9rables, His Brutal Training Regimen, and His Javert Past |access-date=28 January 2013}}</ref>\n* [[Russell Crowe]] as [[Javert]], a police inspector dedicating his life to imprisoning Valjean once again.<ref name=\"ComingSoon\">{{cite web |url=https://www.comingsoon.net/news/movienews.php?id=81882 |title=Russell Crowe Joins Les Mis\u00e9rables |work=ComingSoon.net |date=8 September 2011 |access-date=10 September 2011}}</ref> Before being cast as Javert, Crowe was initially dissatisfied with the character.
