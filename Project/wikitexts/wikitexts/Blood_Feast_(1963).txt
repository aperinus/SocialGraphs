It was composed, shot, and directed by [[Herschell Gordon Lewis]], written by Allison Louise Downe from an idea by Lewis and David F. Freidman, and stars Mal Arnold, William Kerwin, [[Connie Mason]], and Lyn Bolton. The plot focuses on a psychopathic food caterer named Fuad Ramses (Arnold) who kills women so that he can include their body parts in his meals and perform sacrifices to his \"[[Egypt]]ian goddess\" [[Ishtar]].\n\n''Blood Feast'' is considered the first [[Splatter film|splatter]] [[slasher film]], a sub-genre of horror noted for its graphic depictions of on-screen gore. It was highly successful, grossing $4 million against its minuscule $24,500 budget, while receiving poor reviews from critics, who criticized it as amateurish and vulgar. The film was followed by a belated sequel, ''[[Blood Feast 2: All U Can Eat]]'', in 2002.\n\n== Plot ==\nA woman comes home to her [[Miami Beach, Florida|Miami Beach]] apartment and hears of a recent murder in Rogers Park. She herself is then murdered while taking a bath. Before leaving, the killer hacks off her leg above the knee with a [[machete]] and bags it. A copy of a book titled ''Ancient Weird Religious Rites'' is seen near the body.\n\nAt the police station the next morning, Detective Pete Thornton consults with the chief of the homicide bureau about the killings, who says that the killer follows a pattern of mutilating his victims by removing their limbs and organs. Elsewhere in town, Dorothy Fremont hires a caterer named Fuad Ramses to arrange a dinner party for her daughter, Suzette. Ramses \u2013 who is the serial murderer \u2013 tells Mrs. Fremont he will prepare an ancient Egyptian feast for the affair. Mrs. Fremont is delighted, as Suzette has an interest in [[Egyptology]]. After Mrs. Fremont leaves Ramses' store, he goes to a back room, where he has enshrined a statue of the goddess [[Ishtar]]. Ramses is preparing a \"blood feast\" \u2013 a stew made from his victims' blood and body parts intended to resurrect Ishtar.\n\nLater that day, Thornton tells the chief he interviewed the latest victim's acquaintances, and that she was a member of a book club. That evening, teenagers Tony and Marcy are on a nearby beach. Ramses arrives, knocks Tony unconscious, and removes Marcy's brain from her skull. Thornton and the chief arrive on the scene but are unable to get any useful information from a hysterical Tony. They later question Marcy's mother, who tells them Marcy belonged to a book club. Some time later, Ramses stakes out a motel. He knocks on a woman's door and attacks her when she answers, ripping her tongue out as another ingredient to his \"blood feast\".\n\nAt the local university, Suzette attends an Egyptian studies lecture with her boyfriend, Detective Thornton. The lecturer, Dr. Flanders, tells them about the [[pharaoh]]s [[Ramesses I|Ramses I]] and [[Ramesses II|Ramses II]] and the cult of Ishtar that thrived during [[Nineteenth Dynasty of Egypt|their rule]] five thousand years prior. He describes a ritual in which women were sacrificed to the goddess on an altar, their body parts prepared and served as dishes in the feast; this was said to cause Ishtar to be reborn. After the lecture, Suzette and Thornton learn that a victim has been found near death and taken to a hospital. Thornton drives Suzette home and rushes to the hospital. The victim, identified as Janet Blake, recounts her attacker saying something that sounded like \"Etar\", and dies.\n\nRamses receives a letter from Suzette's friend Trudy Sanders, requesting a copy of ''Ancient Weird Religious Rites'' he advertised in the newspaper; he kidnaps Trudy that evening. The next day, Trudy awakens in Ramses's back room. Ramses lashes Trudy with a [[scourge]], collecting her blood in a silver chalice. Suzette informs Thornton that a Fuad Ramses will be catering her dinner party and serving an authentic Egyptian feast in honor of Ishtar. Noting the similarity between the name Ishtar and the word \"Etar\", Thornton calls Dr. Flanders and learns that Ramses is the author of ''Ancient Weird Religious Rites''. Deducing Ramses to be the killer, Thornton and the police race to Ramses' store, where they discover the Ishtar shrine, Trudy's body, and other human remains. The police head to the Fremont house to arrest Ramses and stop the guests from partaking in the feast.\n\nRamses arrives at the dinner party and asks Suzette to help him make the feast \"more authentic.\" He has Suzette lie on a kitchen countertop, and tells her to close her eyes and offer a prayer to Ishtar. As he raises his machete to decapitate her, Mrs. Fremont enters the kitchen, and he flees. The police chase Ramses through a dump, and he climbs into the back of a garbage truck. The unaware truck driver turns on the trash compactor, crushing Ramses. Thornton explains to the chief how he deduced the killer's identity, and says Ramses must have kept a list of people who requested his book as potential victims. The detectives return to their headquarters to file a report; elsewhere, the statue of Ishtar sheds tears of blood.\n\n==Cast (in credits order)==\n* [[William Kerwin]] as Detective Pete Thornton (credited as Thomas Wood)\n* Mal Arnold as Fuad Ramses\n* [[Connie Mason]] as Suzette Fremont\n* Lyn Bolton as Mrs. Dorothy Fremont \n* Scott H.

Lewis, previously a teacher at [[Mississippi State College]], had quit his job in order to enter the film business, and directed several \u201cnudie cutie\u201d films in the early 1960s, produced by [[David F. Friedman]] (who would later produce ''Blood Feast'' and several other splatter films that Lewis would direct). Lewis had seen ''Psycho'' and felt that the film had cheated by showing the results of the murders in the film but not the action, because Hitchcock could not risk getting turned down by theaters. The main idea behind ''Blood Feast'' was that bathtubs of blood would be spilled in an effort to portray an Egyptian meal cooked with the bodies of virgins and the tongue of a woman being ripped out of a woman\u2019s mouth.<ref name=\"Shock Value: How A Few Eccentric Outsiders Gave Us Nightmares, Conquered Hollywood, and Invented Modern Horror\">{{cite book|last1=Zinoman|first1=Jason|title=The Problem with Psycho|date=2011|publisher=Penguin Press|location=New York|pages=33\u201334}}</ref>\n\n=== Filming ===\nFilming took place in Miami, Florida over a period of four days, with a budget of $24,000.<ref name=\"Shock Value: How A Few Eccentric Outsiders Gave Us Nightmares, Conquered Hollywood, and Invented Modern Horror\"/> Director Lewis wanted a realistic prop for the scene where a woman gets her tongue ripped out; in order to accommodate this, a sheep\u2019s tongue was imported from [[Tampa Bay]] and used in the scene. All other limbs and organs used during production were imported locally. Lewis filmed ''Blood Feast'' in color in order to show the red blood used in the film.<ref name=\"Shock Value: How A Few Eccentric Outsiders Gave Us Nightmares, Conquered Hollywood, and Invented Modern Horror\"/>\n\n== Release ==\n\nDistributed by [[Box Office Spectaculars]], the film was released July 6, 1963 at the Bellevue Drive-In in Bellevue (now Peoria) Illinois.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://bbfc.co.uk/releases/blood-feast-1963|title=''BLOOD FEAST'' (18)|publisher=[[British Board of Film Classification]]|access-date=29 March 2018}}</ref>{{failed verification|date=September 2018}} The film was advertised as ''Egyptian Blood Feast'' at [[drive-in theater|drive-ins]] in New York.<ref name=\"IMDb\">{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0056875/trivia |title=Blood Feast (1963) \u2013 Trivia |work=[[Internet Movie Database]] |access-date=12 July 2012}}</ref>{{unreliable source?|date=June 2018}}\n\nProducer Friedman came up with some publicity stunts for the film, such as giving theater-goers \"vomit bags\" and intentionally taking out an [[injunction]] against the film in [[Sarasota]], [[Florida]], in order to gain publicity.

It is often cited erroneously as one of the first films to show people dying with their eyes open (earlier examples include [[D. W. Griffith]]'s 1909 film ''[[The Country Doctor (1909 film)|The Country Doctor]]'', [[William A. Wellman]]'s 1931 film ''[[The Public Enemy]]'' and 1960's ''Psycho'').{{sfn|Palmer|2000|p=41}}\n\nFuad Ramses was described by author Christopher Wayne Curry \u2013 in his book ''A Taste of Blood: The Films of Herschell Gordon Lewis'' \u2013 as \"the original machete-wielding madman\" and the forerunner to similar characters in ''[[Friday the 13th (1980 film)|Friday the 13th]]'' and ''[[Halloween (1978 film)|Halloween]]''. Lewis said of the film, \"I've often referred to ''Blood Feast'' as a [[Walt Whitman]] poem. It's no good, but it was the first of its type.\"{{sfn|Palmer|2000|p=7}} \"One of the all-time greats,\" enthused [[The Cramps|Cramps]] singer and horror aficionado [[Lux Interior]]. \"It was the first gore movie\u2026 Now, it looks kind of funny, but it's still really sick.\"<ref>{{cite magazine|last=M\u00f6rat|title=Splattermania!|magazine=[[Kerrang!]]|date=20 September 1997|page=54}}</ref>\n\n''Blood Feast'' is the first part of what the director's fans call \"The Blood Trilogy\". Rounding out the trilogy are ''[[Two Thousand Maniacs!]]'' (1964) and ''[[Color Me Blood Red]]'' (1965). After the third, producer Friedman said, \"I think that for now we're going to abandon making any more 'super blood and gore' movies, since so many of our contemporaries are launching similar productions, causing a risk that the market will quickly reach a saturation point.\"{{sfn|Romer|Silver|2000|pp=63\u201364}}\n\n== Critical reception ==\n''Blood Feast'' received generally negative reviews. ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' declared the film to be a \"totally inept shocker\", \"incredibly crude and unprofessional from start to finish\" and \"an insult even to the most puerile and salacious of audiences\".<ref name=\"variety-book\" /> The review labeled the entire production a \"fiasco\", calling the screenplay (credited to Louise Downe) \"senseless\", and the acting \"amateurish\". Of Lewis' direction, camerawork, and musical composition, the review judged that he had \"failed dismally on all three counts\".<ref name=\"variety-book\">{{cite book|title=Variety's Film Reviews 1964-1967|volume=11|publisher=R.
