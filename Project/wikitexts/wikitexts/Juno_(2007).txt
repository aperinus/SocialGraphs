[[Elliot Page]]{{efn|name=Elliot}} stars as the title character, an independent-minded teenager confronting an unplanned pregnancy and the subsequent events that put pressures of adult life onto her. [[Michael Cera]], [[Jennifer Garner]], [[Jason Bateman]], [[Allison Janney]] and [[J. K. Simmons]] also star. Filming spanned from early February to March 2007 in [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]]. It premiered on September 8 at the 2007 [[Toronto International Film Festival]], receiving a [[standing ovation]].\n\n''Juno'' won the [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] for [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay|Best Original Screenplay]] and earned three other Oscar nominations, including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]] and [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]] for 20-year old Page (the [[List of oldest and youngest Academy Award winners and nominees#Best Actress in a Leading Role|fifth-youngest nominee]] in the category). The film's soundtrack, featuring several songs performed by [[Kimya Dawson]] in various guises, was the first chart-topping soundtrack since ''[[Dreamgirls: Music from the Motion Picture|Dreamgirls]]'' and [[Searchlight Pictures|Fox Searchlight]]'s first number-one soundtrack. ''Juno'' earned back its initial budget of $6.5 million in twenty days, the first nineteen of which were when the film was in [[limited release]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=juno.htm |title=Juno (2007)&nbsp;\u2013 Daily Box Office Results |access-date=January 17, 2008 |website=[[Box Office Mojo]]}}</ref> It went on to earn $231 million worldwide.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=juno.htm |title=Juno (2007) \u2013 Box Office Mojo |website=Box Office Mojo |language=en |access-date=August 18, 2017}}</ref> ''Juno'' received acclaim from critics, many of whom placed the film on their top-ten lists for the year. It has received criticism and praise from members of both the [[United States anti-abortion movement|anti-abortion]] and [[Abortion-rights movements|abortion rights]] communities regarding its treatment of abortion.\n\n==Plot==\nIn [[Elk River, Minnesota]], sixteen year old high-schooler Juno MacGuff discovers she is pregnant by her friend and longtime admirer Paulie Bleeker. She initially considers an [[abortion]]. Going to a local clinic run by a women's group, she encounters a schoolmate outside who is holding a one-person [[anti-abortion]] vigil.  Once inside, Juno decides to give the baby up for adoption instead. With the help of her friend Leah, Juno searches the ads in the ''[[Pennysaver]]'' and finds a childless married couple she feels will provide a suitable home. She tells her father Mac and stepmother Bren, who offer their support. With Mac, Juno meets the couple, Mark and Vanessa Loring, in their expensive [[Saint Cloud, Minnesota|Saint Cloud]] home, and agrees to a [[closed adoption]].\n\nJuno visits Mark a few times, and finds they share tastes in [[punk rock]] and [[horror film]]s. Mark, who has set aside his rock band youth (now confined to memorabilia displayed in the one room of the house that Vanessa has designated for Mark's personal belongings), works at home composing commercial jingles. Juno and Leah happen to see Vanessa in a shopping mall being completely at ease with a child, and Juno encourages Vanessa to talk to the baby in Juno's womb, which kicks for Vanessa.\n\nAs the pregnancy progresses, Juno struggles with the emotions she feels for the baby's father Paulie. Juno maintains an outwardly indifferent attitude toward Paulie, but when she learns Paulie has asked another girl to the upcoming prom, she confronts him in a jealous rage. Paulie reminds Juno that it is at her request they remain distant and tells her she broke his heart.\n\nNot long before her baby is due, Juno is again visiting Mark when their interaction becomes emotional. Mark then tells her he will be leaving Vanessa to figure his life out. Juno is horrified by this revelation, with Mark asking Juno, \"How do you think of me?\", revealing he is starting to develop feelings for her. Vanessa arrives home, and Mark tells Vanessa he does not feel ready to be a father. Juno drives away and breaks down in tears by the side of the road. Returning to the Lorings' house, Juno leaves a note and disappears as the Lorings answer the door.\n\nAfter a heartfelt discussion with her father, Juno accepts that she loves Paulie. Juno then tells Paulie she loves him, and Paulie's actions make it clear her feelings are very much reciprocated. Not long after, Juno goes into labor and is rushed to the hospital, where she gives birth to a baby boy. She had deliberately not told Paulie because of his track meet. Seeing her missing from the stands, Paulie rushes to the hospital, finds Juno has given birth to their son, and comforts Juno as she cries.\n\nVanessa comes to the hospital, where she joyfully claims the newborn boy as a single adoptive mother. On the wall in the baby's new nursery, Vanessa has framed Juno's note, which reads: \"Vanessa: If you're still in, I'm still in. \u2014Juno.\" The film ends in the summertime with Juno and Paulie playing guitar and singing together, in a happy relationship.\n\n== Cast ==\n<!--- Cast and order per tombstone opening credits, roles per closing credits scroll --->\n* [[Elliot Page]]{{efn|name=Elliot}} as Juno MacGuff, the birth mother, Paulie's girlfriend\n* [[Michael Cera]] as Paulie Bleeker, the father of Juno's child, and Juno's boyfriend\n* [[Jennifer Garner]] as Vanessa Loring, Mark's wife and the prospective adoptive mother of Juno's child\n* [[Jason Bateman]] as Mark Loring, Vanessa's husband and the prospective adoptive father of Juno's child\n* [[Allison Janney]] as Bren MacGuff, Juno's stepmother\n* [[J.
