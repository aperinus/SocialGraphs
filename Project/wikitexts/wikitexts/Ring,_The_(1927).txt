Bob's manager is impressed with Jack's performance and offers him the chance to become Bob's full-time sparring partner, on the condition that he win a trial fight to be arranged at a later date.\n\nBob begins spending more time with Jack's girlfriend Mabel (Lillian Hall-Davis) and buys a bracelet for her to express his feelings. The two kiss but Mabel reluctantly puts a stop to it. The next day when Jack inquires about the bracelet, Mabel lies to Jack, telling him that Bob bought it for her because he didn't want to take the money.\n\nJack wins his trial fight and is made Bob's official sparring partner. Keeping his earlier promise to Mabel, he agrees to marry her the next day. Mabel goes through with the wedding, although somewhat reluctantly due to her new-found feelings for Bob. At the wedding reception Bob jokingly states that he wishes Mabel had been the prize at his and Jack's original fight. Jack boldly states that he would defend his wife in a fight against any man. A friendly exhibition match is arranged between the two fighters which Bob wins. After the fight Jack sees his bride flirting with Bob and suspects that they are having an affair. Jack declares his intent to fight Bob for the heavyweight championship, but is told he is not yet ranked high enough in the league to challenge Bob. Training intensively, Jack works his way up the rankings and eventually becomes the number one contender.\n\nJack arranges a party with his friends in his apartment as a way to surprise Mabel and let her know that he has won his latest fight and will now be fighting for Bob's title. Jack and his friends wait long into the night but Mabel does not show up. After Jack's friends leave, Jack stays up and waits for Mabel and eventually he sees her getting out of Bob's car. Jack angrily confronts Mabel about her liaisons with Bob and smashes a framed picture of him. Jack then goes to the club where Bob is and confronts him. Bob throws a punch but Jack knocks him out before he connects. Jack informs Bob that he is officially the number one contender and they will settle their differences in the ring.\n\nOn the day of the fight, the two fighters seem evenly matched until the final rounds where Bob starts to dominate Jack. Jack considers giving up until Mabel, seeing him in pain, runs over to his corner and declares that she wants to be with him, not Bob. Jack musters up his remaining energy and unleashes a flurry of punches in the final round, eventually knocking Bob out and winning the fight. Jack and Mabel embrace as Bob accepts defeat.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Carl Brisson]] as 'One-Round' Jack Sander\n* [[Lillian Hall-Davis]] as Mabel (as Lilian Hall Davis)\n* [[Ian Hunter (actor)|Ian Hunter]] as Bob Corby\n* [[Forrester Harvey]] as James Ware\n* [[Harry Terry]] as Showman\n* [[Gordon Harker]] as Jack's Trainer\n* [[Charles Farrell (Irish actor)|Charles Farrell]] as Second {{small|(uncredited)}}\n* [[Clare Greet]] as Fortune Teller {{small|(uncredited)}}\n* [[Tom Helmore]] {{small|(uncredited)}}\n* [[Minnie Rayner]] as Boxing Contestant's Wife {{small|(uncredited)}}\n* Brandy Walker as Spectator {{small|(uncredited)}}\n* [[Billy Wells]] as Boxer {{small|(uncredited)}}\n\n==Production==\nThe film was made at [[Elstree Studios (Shenley Road)|Elstree Studios]] by the newly established [[Associated British Picture Corporation|British International Pictures]], which emerged as one of the two British major studios during the late 1920s and began hiring leading directors from Britain and abroad. It was Hitchcock's first film for the company after joining from [[Gainsborough Pictures]]. It was also the first film to be released by the company.<ref name=\"Ryall\">{{cite book|last=Ryall|first=Tom|title=Alfred Hitchcock and the British Cinema, p. 93-94|year=1996|publisher=Athlone Press}}</ref>\n\n===Inception===\nHitchcock was 28 years old when he directed ''The Ring'', and this was the young filmmaker's fourth film. Hitchcock regularly attended boxing matches in London where he lived, and he was struck by the fact that a good number of the spectators appeared to be from good backgrounds and dressed in white. He also noticed that fighters were sprinkled with champagne at the end of each round. These details persuaded Hitchcock to start work on ''The Ring''.\n\n===Screenplay===\nAfter directing ''[[Downhill (1927 film)|Downhill]]'' and ''[[Easy Virtue (1928 film)|Easy Virtue]]'', two stage adaptations for the [[Gainsborough Pictures|Gainsborough company]], Hitchcock was frustrated and jumped at the chance to develop an idea of his own. ''The Ring'' is commonly described as Hitchcock's only original screenplay although it actually had input from at least [[Eliot Stannard]], who wrote all of Hitchcock's other silent films.<ref name=\"RingGuide\">{{cite web|url=http://www.brentonfilm.com/articles/alfred-hitchcock-collectors-guide-the-ring-1927|title=Alfred Hitchcock Collectors' Guide: The Ring|publisher=Brenton Film}}</ref> Colleagues at the studio were impressed by the neatness of Hitchcock's script and his grasp of structure. What's more, writing for silent films came naturally to a director who already thought in visual terms. He was much less comfortable with dialogue, which goes some way to explain why he took no sole writing credit in any later films and worked extensively alongside other writers throughout his career.\n\n===Directing===\nThe film, was considered a major technical work by [[Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut]] in the book ''[[Hitchcock/Truffaut]]'' and by [[Thomas Chabrol]] and [[Eric Rohmer]] in their book about Hitchcock. It features use of the [[Sch\u00fcfftan process]] to simulate a large audience in climactic scenes set in the [[Royal Albert Hall]]. Hitchcock returned to this technique years later in films like ''[[The Man Who Knew Too Much (1934 film)|The Man Who Knew Too Much]]'' in its Royal Albert Hall sequence.\n\n==Reception==\nThe film was a major success with critics; however, when it went on general release it was considered a box-office failure.<ref>Ryall</ref>\n\n==Preservation and home video status==\nA restoration of ''The Ring'' was completed in 2012 as part of the [[British Film Institute|BFI]]'s \u00a32 million \"Save the Hitchcock 9\" project to restore all of the director's surviving silent films.<ref name=\"HitchcockGuide\">{{cite web|url=http://www.brentonfilm.com/articles/alfred-hitchcock-collectors-guide|title=Alfred Hitchcock Collectors' Guide|publisher=Brenton Film}}</ref>\n\nLike Hitchcock's other British films, all of which are copyrighted worldwide,<ref name=HitchcockGuide/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brentonfilm.com/articles/alfred-hitchcock-dial-c-for-copyright|title=Alfred Hitchcock: Dial \u00a9 for Copyright|publisher=Brenton Film}}</ref> ''The Ring'' has been heavily [[Bootleg recording|bootlegged]] on home video.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brentonfilm.com/articles/bootlegs-galore-the-great-alfred-hitchcock-rip-off|title=Bootlegs Galore: The Great Alfred Hitchcock Rip-off|publisher=Brenton Film}}</ref> Despite this, various licensed, restored releases have appeared on DVD, Blu-ray, and video-on-demand services from [[StudioCanal UK|Optimum]] in the UK as well as [[Lionsgate]] and [[Kino International (company)|Kino Lorber]] in the US, and many others.<ref name=RingGuide/>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|id=0018328|title=The Ring}}\n* {{rotten-tomatoes|id=1057839-ring|title=The Ring}}\n* [http://www.screenonline.org.uk/film/id/437772/index.html ''The Ring''] at the [[British Film Institute]]'s [[Screenonline]]\n* [http://www.brentonfilm.com/articles/alfred-hitchcock-collectors-guide-the-ring-1927 ''Alfred Hitchcock Collectors\u2019 Guide: The Ring'' at Brenton Film]\n\n{{Alfred Hitchcock}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Ring, The}}\n[[Category:1927 films]]\n[[Category:1920s sports drama films]]\n[[Category:British boxing films]]\n[[Category:Films shot at British International Pictures Studios]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Alfred Hitchcock]]\n[[Category:British black-and-white films]]\n[[Category:British silent feature films]]\n[[Category:British sports drama films]]\n[[Category:Films set in England]]\n[[Category:1927 drama films]]\n[[Category:1920s English-language films]]\n[[Category:1920s British films]]\n[[Category:Silent drama films]]"}]}}}}
