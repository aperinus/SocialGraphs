Desperate for any kind of income, he meets Luther Fox, an Englishman who runs an exclusive [[escort service]] called Elysian Fields, and is offered a job.\n\nHiding his new employment from his wife, Byron finds that one of his clients, Andrea, is married to a much older, ill Pulitzer Prize-winning author whom Tiller greatly admires. Complications develop as he develops a relationship with the author, essentially cowriting his latest book.  Tiller faces new challenges as he tries to separate a professional obligation to the wife, his client, from a professional interest and responsibility to a fellow writer, her spouse.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Andy Garcia]] as Byron Tiller\n* [[Mick Jagger]] as Lucius Fox<ref>{{Cite web|last=Clark|first=Ashley|date=2016-02-08|title=Gimme celluloid: a history of Mick Jagger on film|url=http://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/feb/08/mick-jagger-hbo-vinyl-acting-roles|url-status=live|access-date=2021-10-19|website=the Guardian|language=en}}</ref>\n* [[Julianna Margulies]] as Dena Tiller\n* [[Olivia Williams]] as Andrea Alcott\n* [[James Coburn]] as Tobias Alcott\n* [[Anjelica Huston]] as Jennifer Adler\n* [[Michael Des Barres]] as Nigel Halsey\n* [[Richard Bradford (actor)|Richard Bradford]] as Edward Rodgers\n\n==Reception==\nOn review aggregation website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] the film had a rating of 51% based on 70 reviews, with an average of 5.9/10.
