Jasper has just found out he has another son named Eli (again, played by Dale), who lives in [[Philadelphia]].\n\nIt turns out that years ago, Jasper's crazy ways were too much for his bride from England, so she left\u2014leaving behind one twin\u2014and returned to England. With the help of his English butler Mansfield, he writes a new will that mentions Eli, then fakes his death by pretending to fall off a cliff in front of Bloodshy's corrupt mayor Ragsdale (McGavin) and sheriff Denver Kid (Knotts), both of whom he has just told about his second son.\n\nEli turns out to be the opposite of Wild Billy. He works as a [[Salvation Army]] [[missionary]] in Philadelphia with [[orphan]]s named Roxanne (Debbie Lytton) and Marcus ([[Michael Sharrett]]). When Eli receives a [[telegram]] informing him about his father's death, a father that he did not know existed, he decides to accept the invitation to come to Bloodshy for his inheritance, bringing Marcus and Roxanne with him.\n\nTheir stagecoach is held up by the Snead brothers, a group of outlaws that Ragsdale has sent to run off Eli. Unfortunately, nobody was told that Jasper's other son was a twin, so they mistake Eli for Wild Billy (the first of many to mistake the two brothers for one another). The Sneads return to Bloodshy, but cause the stagecoach to run off, leaving Eli, Marcus and Roxanne stranded. On their way to Bloodshy (by foot), they meet a woman named Jenny (Valentine) who is also headed for Bloodshy to start a school. They head for the town together.\n\nMansfield brings the will to Sheriff Denver to deliver to Ragsdale. From there, it is learned that a contest is involved in the inheritance. The contest is a miles-long obstacle course known as the Bloody Bloodshy Trail that involves operating train engines, crossing a gorge using a rope, climbing a mountain and driving a wagon.\n\nDuring the contest both Eli and Billy realize that Ragsdale has set them up to kill each other so that he would collect the entire fortune. Both brothers make up and expose Ragsdale for what he really is. Soon after, Ragsdale is imprisoned and Denver Kid becomes the new mayor.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Jim Dale]] as Jasper/Wild Billy/Eli Bloodshy\n* [[Karen Valentine]] as Jenny, a teacher\n* [[Don Knotts]] as Sheriff Denver Kid\n* [[Darren McGavin]] as Mayor Ragsdale\n* [[Jack Elam]] as Rattlesnake\n* [[Dallas McKennon]] as Saloon Man\n* [[John Williams (actor)|John Williams]] as Mansfield\n* [[Warren Vanders]] as Boss Snead\n* Debbie Lytton as Roxanne\n* [[Michael Sharrett]] as Marcus\n* David Cass as Jack\n* Richard Wright as Pete\n* [[Don \"Red\" Barry]] as Bartender\n* Jimmy Van Patten as Jake\n* [[Gregg Palmer]] as Jeff\n* [[Ed Bakey]] as Joshua\n* [[John Steadman (actor)|John Steadman]] as Old Codger \n* [[Eric Server]] as Cowboy \n* [[Paul Lukather]] as Cowboy \n* Hap Lawrence as Cowboy \n* Robert Rothwell as Cowboy \n* Terry Nichols as Prisoner \n* [[Stanley Clements]] as Saloon Man \n* [[Don Brodie]] as Saloon Man \n* Warde Donovan as Saloon Man \n* Ron Honthaner as Saloon Man \n* Norland Benson as Farmer \n* [[Jack Bender]] as Farmer\n* Jim Whitecloud as Indian Chief\n* Brad Weston as Indian \n* Russ Fast as Official \n* Mike Howden as Official \n* Art Burke as Official\n* James Michaelford as Dead-Eye\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Official website|http://movies.disney.com/hot-lead-and-cold-feet}}\n* {{IMDb title|0077698}}\n* {{allmovie title}}\n* {{rotten-tomatoes|hot_lead_and_cold_feet}}\n* {{tcmdb title|78432|Hot Lead and Cold Feet}}\n\n{{Robert Butler}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Hot Lead And Cold Feet}}\n[[Category:1978 films]]\n[[Category:1970s Western (genre) comedy films]]\n[[Category:Walt Disney Pictures films]]\n[[Category:American Western (genre) comedy films]]\n[[Category:1970s English-language films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Robert Butler]]\n[[Category:Films produced by Ron W.
