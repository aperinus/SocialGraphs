Starring Pegg, [[Nick Frost]], [[Timothy Dalton]], and [[Jim Broadbent]], the film centres on two police officers investigating a series of mysterious and gruesome deaths in a [[West Country]] village. It is the second and most successful film in the ''[[Three Flavours Cornetto trilogy|Three Flavours Cornetto]]'' trilogy, succeeding ''[[Shaun of the Dead]]'' (2004) and followed by ''[[The World's End (film)|The World's End]]'' (2013).\n\nOver 100 [[action film]]s were used as inspiration for developing the script. [[Principal photography]] took place in [[Wells, Somerset]] \u2013 Wright's hometown \u2013 over eleven weeks in early 2006. [[Visual effect]]s were developed by ten artists to expand on or add explosions, gore and gunfire scenes. The film opened on 16 February 2007 in the United Kingdom and 20 April in the United States to box office success, grossing US$80 million worldwide against a budget of $12\u201316 million. The film was praised by critics. In 2020, [[Empire (film magazine)|''Empire'']] named it the 67th greatest film of the 21st century.<ref>{{Cite web|title=The 100 Greatest Movies Of The 21st Century: 70 - 61|url=https://www.empireonline.com/movies/features/best-movies-century-page-4/|access-date=2021-04-01|website=Empire}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- STOP! Per [[WP:FILMPLOT]], plot summaries should not exceed 700 words. Please don't expand this summary. -->\nPC Nicholas Angel, a high-achieving [[Metropolitan Police Service|Metropolitan Police]] officer, is promoted to Sergeant, but his resentful colleagues arrange for him to be reassigned to the small rural town of Sandford, [[Gloucestershire]], a regular \"Village of the Year\" winner. Angel is soon frustrated by the mundanity of the village, his lazy and incompetent colleagues, and local police and [[Neighbourhood Watch|Neighbourhood Watch Alliance]] (NWA) commitment to low crime statistics rather than law enforcement. His partner, PC Danny Butterman, whom he arrested for [[drink-driving]], is a fan of [[buddy cop film]]s and the son of Inspector Frank Butterman, Angel's superior.\n\nMartin Blower and Eve Draper, the two lead actors of an [[amateur dramatics|am-dram]] production of ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'', whom Angel had pulled over for speeding, are murdered by a cloaked axe-wielding figure, who stages it as a car accident. Angel is the only officer who suspects foul play. Sent to resolve a small dispute, Angel discovers an illegal weapons stash, including an old [[sea mine]], and confiscates it. Angel warms to Danny, and they binge-watch action movies at Danny's home. That night, wealthy land developer George Merchant is attacked in his home by a cloaked figure and killed in a deliberate gas explosion.\n\nAngel suspects that the killings are connected to a recent property deal. A local journalist, Tim Messenger, approaches Angel at a village fete, claiming to have information, but another cloaked figure dislodges masonry atop the church's tower, which falls and kills Messenger. Whilst buying Danny a late birthday gift, Angel learns from Leslie Tiller, the village florist, about her plans to sell her land to Merchant's business partners. While Angel retrieves his notebook, she is stabbed in the neck with her garden shears; Angel gives chase but loses the killer. Angel suspects Simon Skinner, a supermarket manager, as the property deal would have built a rival supermarket, but Skinner has an alibi.\n\nAngel is attacked in his hotel room by one of Skinner's employees, Michael \"Lurch\" Armstrong. Angel knocks him out and learns of a secret NWA meeting at Sandford Castle. Angel confronts the NWA, led by Frank, who reveal that they committed the murders, staged as accidents, for various petty reasons as each victim threatened Sandford's chances of winning Village of the Year. Frank's motive is his late wife Irene; she put everything into helping Sandford win the first \"Village of the Year\", but [[New Age travellers|travellers]] ruined their chances the night before the judges arrived, driving her to suicide. Angel flees and falls into the castle's [[catacombs]], where he finds the corpses of the NWA's other victims. Danny appears and fakes killing Angel. Pretending to dispose of the body, Danny drives Angel away and urges him to return to London for his own safety. At a petrol station, Angel sees a rack of the films he and Danny bonded over and decides to return to Sandford.\n\nAngel arms himself with the confiscated guns, then he and Danny engage in a shootout with the NWA. When Frank orders the other officers to arrest them, Angel and Danny convince them that Frank is the culprit. Frank flees and the officers besiege the supermarket, with Skinner fleeing in a car with Frank. Angel corners Skinner at Sandford's [[miniature park|model village]], and Skinner is impaled through the jaw by a miniature church steeple. Frank attempts to escape in Angel's car but is attacked by a missing swan that Angel and Danny had recaptured earlier.\n\nAngel's former superiors arrive and ask him to return to London, as the crime rate has risen heavily in his absence, but Angel decides to remain in Sandford. While the Sandford Police are going over the paperwork of the arrests, the elderly Tom Weaver, the last NWA member, bursts into the station wielding a [[blunderbuss]]. He shoots at Angel, but Danny jumps in front. In the resulting struggle, Weaver accidentally activates the sea mine, killing himself and destroying the station.\n\nOne year later, Angel has been promoted to Inspector and head of the Sandford police, and Danny is Sergeant. After visiting Irene's grave, the two drive off to their next crime scene.\n<!-- STOP! Per [[WP:FILMPLOT]], plot summaries should not exceed 700 words.

references===\n\n====Self-references====\nWright has said that ''Hot Fuzz'' takes elements from his final amateur film, ''[[Dead Right (film)|Dead Right]]'', which he described as both \"''[[Lethal Weapon]]'' set in Somerset\" and \"a ''[[Dirty Harry]]'' film in Somerset\".<ref name=\"comedy map\" /> He uses some of the same locations in both films, including the [[Somerfield]] supermarket, where he used to work as a shelf-stacker.<ref name=\"comedy map\" />\n\nReferences to ''Shaun of the Dead'' are also present in the film. In one scene, Nicholas wants to chase a shoplifter by jumping over several garden fences; however, Danny is reluctant. Nicholas says, \"What's the matter, Danny? You never taken a shortcut before?\" He smiles assuredly before jumping over three in a row (according to the DVD commentary, Pegg vaulted over three fences, and a stunt man did a [[back flip]] over the fourth). When Danny attempts it, he trips and falls through the fence. This is almost identical to a scene in ''Shaun of the Dead'', including the fall-through-fence gag, albeit with the pratfalling role reverse: in ''Shaun of the Dead'' it happens to Pegg's character rather than Frost's, and he falls over the fence rather than through it. The DVD commentary says that Frost purposely looked back at the camera after crashing through the fence, to show that he had done the stunt rather than someone else.\n\nFrost's characters (Danny in ''Hot Fuzz'', Ed in ''Shaun of the Dead'') have a liking for [[Cornetto (ice cream)|Cornetto]] ice cream.<ref name=\"ZombiesParty\">{{cite news |title=Simon Pegg and Nick Frost |publisher=CraveOnline |url=http://www.craveonline.com/lifestyle/articles/157660-simon-pegg-and-nick-frost |date=9 April 2007 |access-date=6 September 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160221000858/http://www.craveonline.com/site/157660-simon-pegg-and-nick-frost |archive-date=21 February 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Pegg and Wright have referred to ''Hot Fuzz'' as being the second film in the \"[[Three Flavours Cornetto trilogy]]\", with ''[[Shaun of the Dead]]'' being the first and ''[[The World's End (film)|The World's End]]'' being the third.<ref name=\"BloodIce\">{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/7642129.stm |title=Interview with Simon Pegg |access-date=23 March 2009 |publisher=BBC |date=1 October 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170804052649/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7642129.stm|archive-date=4 August 2017|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"BloodIceSavour\">{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/apr/03/news.uk |last=Brown |first=Mark |title=Spaced duo savour sweet taste of success |access-date=23 March 2009 |date=3 April 2008 |work=[[guardian.co.uk]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160306144933/http://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/apr/03/news.uk|archive-date=6 March 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n====Other films====\nVarious scenes in ''Hot Fuzz'' feature a variety of action film DVDs such as ''[[Police Story 3: Super Cop]]'' and scenes from ''[[Point Break]]'' and ''[[Bad Boys II]]''.

On the topic of perceived gun fetishes in these movies, Pegg has said, \"Men can't do that thing, which is the greatest achievement of humankind, which is to make another human, so we make metal versions of our own penises and fire more bits of metal out of the end into people's heads... It's our turn to grab the gun by the hilt and fire it into your face.\"<ref name=\"culture\" /> Despite this, Pegg maintains that the film is not a spoof, in that \"They lack the sneer that a lot of parodies have that look down on their source material.

For one of the final scenes of the film, the Sandford police station is destroyed by an explosion. Part of the explosion was created by using a set model that showed its windows being blown out, while the building remained intact. The actual destruction of the building was depicted by exploding a miniature model of the station.<ref name=\"HotFuzzDVD\" />\n\nSimilar to the work in ''Shaun of the Dead'', blood and gore was prevalent throughout the film. [[Visual effects]] supervisor Richard Briscoe revealed the rationale for using the large amounts of blood: \"In many ways, the more extreme you make it, the more people know it is stylised and enjoy the humour inherent in how ridiculous it is. It's rather like the (eventually) limbless [[Black Knight (Monty Python)|Black Knight]] in [''[[Monty Python and the Holy Grail]]''].\"<ref name=\"VFX\" /> The most time-consuming gore sequence involved a character's head being crushed by a section of a church. A dummy was used against a [[Chroma key|green screen]] and the head was detonated at the point when the object was about to impact the body. Throughout the film, over seventy gunfight shots were digitally augmented; Briscoe's rationale for adding the additional effects was that \"The town square shootout, for example, is full of extra little hits scattered throughout, so that it feels like our hero characters really do have it all going off, all around them. It was a great demonstration of [how] seemingly very trivial enhancements can make a difference when combined across a sequence.\"<ref name=\"VFX\" />\n\n==Promotion==\nThe first two [[Trailer (promotion)|teaser trailers]] were released on 16 October 2006.
