Warshawski''''' is a 1991 American [[Action film#Action-comedy|action-comedy]] [[crime film]] directed by [[Jeff Kanew]] and starring [[Kathleen Turner]], [[Jay O. Sanders]], [[Charles Durning]], [[Lynnie Godfrey]], [[Anne Pitoniak]], Geof Prysirr, [[Angela Goethals]], [[Stephen Meadows]], [[Frederick Coffin]], [[Stephen Root]] and [[Wayne Knight]].\n\n==Plot==\nVictoria Iphigenia \"V.I\" Warshawski ([[Kathleen Turner]]) is a [[Chicago]]-based, [[freelance]] [[private investigator]] who lives the part of the hard-boiled detective, but below the surface, she is a softy. One night, while she is drinking at her favorite bar, she meets an ex-[[Chicago Blackhawks|Blackhawks]] hockey player named \"Boom-Boom\" Grafalk ([[Stephen Meadows]]). The two connect and a romance appears to be in the making, but Warshawski is surprised when \"Boom-Boom\" appears at her doorstep later that night with his 13-year-old daughter Kat ([[Angela Goethals]]) in tow.\n\nHe asks Warshawski if she could watch her, and Warshawski agrees. Later that night, \"Boom-Boom\" is killed in a boat explosion, and Kat hires Warshawski to track down her father's killer. In doing so, she befriends the victim's daughter; together they set out to crack the case.\n\n==Principal cast==\n* [[Kathleen Turner]] as Victoria Iphigenia \"V.I.\" Warshawski\n* [[Jay O. Sanders]] as Murray Ryerson\n* [[Charles Durning]] as Lieutenant Bobby Mallory\n* [[Lynnie Godfrey]] as Sal\n* [[Anne Pitoniak]] as Lotty\n* Geof Prysirr as Ron Whartley\n* [[Robert Clotworthy]] as Philip Pugh\n* [[Angela Goethals]] as Katherine \"Kat\" Grafalk, Bernard's Daughter\n* Nancy Paul as Paige Wilson-Grafalk\n* [[Stephen Meadows]] as Bernard \"Boom-Boom\" Grafalk\n* [[Frederick Coffin]] as Horton Grafalk\n* [[Charles McCaughan]] as Trumble Grafalk\n* [[John Fujioka]] as Sumitora\n* [[John Beasley (actor)|John Beasley]] as Ernie\n* [[Stephen Root]] as Mickey\n* [[Wayne Knight]] as Earl \"Bonehead\" Smeissen\n* [[Lee Arenberg]] as \"Flesh\"\n* [[Mike Hagerty]] as \"Babe\"\n* Tom Allard as Eddie \"Big Eddie\"\n* Herb Muller as Contreras\n* [[Everett Smith]] as McGraw \n* Gene Hartline as Thug\n\n==Production==\n===Writing===\nThe film was based on [[V. I. Warshawski|a series of books]] by [[Sara Paretsky]]. Screenwriters Edward Taylor, David Aaron Cohen, and Nick Thiel adapted only one of Sara Paretsky's novels, ''[[Deadlock (novel)|Deadlock]]'', for the script for this movie, which took at least one liberty with the story. Whereas Paretsky had written the novel as a serious mystery, the screenwriters took an almost comedic approach. Paretsky was especially angry over the original script that had the independent female detective subordinate to a male counterpart for fear that a female character could not hold the lead role.\n\nThe film's plot is very different from that of ''Deadlock''. In the book the ex-Blackhawks player Boom-Boom was the protagonist detective's cousin and lifelong companion, rather than a chance-met stranger; he had no daughter; and \"Grafalk\" was the family name of another character altogether, a devious shipping magnate who had a major role in the book but was dropped from the film.\n\n===Casting===\nInitially, the producers wanted to set the film in Baltimore and cast either [[Amy Madigan]], [[Bette Midler]] or [[Jane Fonda]] as Warshawski. Kathleen Turner reprised her character V.I. Warshawski in a series of radio plays on [[BBC Radio 4]], the radio version of ''Deadlock'' itself being broadcast in 1993.\n\n===Filming===\nPrincipal production began in Chicago in November 1990. Scenes were filmed at [[Wrigley Field]], Chicago; [[Green Mill Cocktail Lounge]] - 4802 N. Broadway Avenue, Chicago, (used as the Golden Glow Cocktail Lounge); San Pedro, California, Long Beach, California; Fire Station 23 - 225 E. 5th Street, Los Angeles, and Warner Bros Studios. Completed shooting February 27, 1991.\n\n==Reception==\nJanet Maslin of ''The New York Times'' had mixed thoughts about the film but commended the acting: \"It's too bad that ''V.I. Warshawski'' is itself a lot less glamorous than Ms. Turner's performance, since the character could easily be the centerpiece of a more appealing film...''V.I. Warshawski'' has a breezy style and a serviceable, even surprising detective plot. And it has Ms. Turner, who makes the most of [[V.I. Warshawski]]'s sardonic humor.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?_r=1&res=9D0CEEDB1330F935A15754C0A967958260 |title=V.I.

Her laugh seems aged by whiskey, her smile is brave in the face of trouble, she kisses guys as if she'll never see them again, and she's usually right.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19910726/REVIEWS/107260303/1023 |title=V.I.
