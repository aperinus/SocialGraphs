It features [[Film score|original music]] by [[Danny Elfman]].\n\n==Plot==\nSuzanne Stone has always been obsessed with being on television, aspiring to become a world-famous broadcast journalist. She marries Larry Maretto, using his family restaurant business to keep herself financially stable, and takes a job as an assistant at WWEN, a local cable station, in hopes of climbing the network ladder. Through relentless persistence, she's eventually promoted to doing the station's evening weather report.\n\nWhen Larry starts asking her to give up her career in favor of helping out at the restaurant and starting a family with him, Suzanne immediately begins plotting to get rid of him. She manipulates the high-schooler subjects of the TV documentary she has been making, ''Teens Speak Out'', into doing her bidding, seducing Jimmy Emmett and coercing him and his friends, the [[Juvenile delinquency|delinquent]] Russell Hines and the shy Lydia Mertz, into killing Larry. With the help of Russell and Lydia, Jimmy ultimately commits the murder.\n\nThough Larry's death is ruled the result of a botched [[burglary]], the police stumble across a ''Teens Speak Out'' clip of Suzanne at their school which points to her sexual involvement with Jimmy. The teens are arrested and connected to the crime scene. Lydia makes a deal with the police to converse with Suzanne while wearing a [[wiretap|wire]], and Suzanne unwittingly reveals her hand in the murder. However, despite this damning evidence, Suzanne argues that the police resorted to [[entrapment]] and is released on [[bail]]. All the charges against Suzanne are dropped.\n\nBasking in the media spotlight, however, Suzanne fabricates a story about Larry being a [[cocaine]] addict who was murdered by Jimmy and Russell, his purported dealers. Jimmy and Russell are sentenced to [[life in prison]]. Russell gets his sentence reduced while Lydia is released on [[probation]]. Meanwhile, Larry's father, Joe, realizes Suzanne was behind his son's death and uses his [[Italian-American Mafia|mafia]] connections to have her murdered. A [[hitman]] lures Suzanne away from her home by posing as a movie studio executive, kills her, and conceals her body beneath a frozen lake.\n\nLydia tells her side of the story in a televised interview and gains national attention, becoming a celebrity. Janice, Larry's sister who always hated Suzanne, practices her [[figure skating]] on the frozen lake where Suzanne's corpse lies.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Nicole Kidman]] as Suzanne Stone-Maretto\n* [[Joaquin Phoenix]] as Jimmy Emmett\n* [[Matt Dillon]] as Larry Maretto\n* [[Casey Affleck]] as Russell Hines\n* [[Illeana Douglas]] as Janice Maretto\n* [[Alison Folland]] as Lydia Mertz\n* [[Dan Hedaya]] as Joe Maretto\n* [[Maria Tucci]] as Angela Maretto\n* [[Wayne Knight]] as Ed Grant\n* [[Kurtwood Smith]] as Earl Stone\n* [[Holland Taylor]] as Carol Stone\n* [[Susan Traylor]] as Fay Stone\n* [[Tim Hopper]] as Mike Warden\n* [[Michael Rispoli]] as Ben DeLuca\n* [[Buck Henry]] as Mr. H.
