It was released in the United Kingdom as '''''Closely Observed Trains'''''. It is a [[coming-of-age story]] about a young man working at a train station in [[German occupation of Czechoslovakia|German-occupied Czechoslovakia]] during [[World War II]]. The film is based on a 1965 novel by [[Bohumil Hrabal]]. It was produced by [[Barrandov Studios]] and filmed on location in Central Bohemia. Released outside Czechoslovakia during 1967, it won the [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film|Best Foreign Language Oscar]] at the [[40th Academy Awards]] in 1968.<ref name=\"Oscars1968\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/1968 |title=The 40th Academy Awards (1968) Nominees and Winners |access-date=2011-11-12|work=oscars.org}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nThe young Milo\u0161 Hrma, who speaks with misplaced pride of his family of misfits and [[Wiktionary:malinger#English|malingerers]], is engaged as a newly-trained [[train dispatcher]] at a small railway station near the end of the [[Second World War]] and the [[German occupation of Czechoslovakia]]. He admires himself in his new uniform and looks forward, like his prematurely retired [[train driver]] father, to avoiding real work. The sometimes pompous stationmaster is an enthusiastic pigeon-breeder who has a kind wife, but is envious of train dispatcher Hubi\u010dka's success with women. The [[Wiktionary:idyll#Pronunciation|idyll]] of the railway station is periodically disturbed by the arrival of councilor Zedn\u00ed\u010dek, a Nazi collaborator who spouts propaganda at the staff, though he does not influence anyone with it.\n\nMilo\u0161 is in a budding relationship with the pretty, young conductor M\u00e1\u0161a. The experienced Hubi\u010dka presses for details and realizes that Milo\u0161 is still a virgin. At her initiative, M\u00e1\u0161a spends the night with Milo\u0161, but in his youthful excitability he ejaculates prematurely and is unable to perform sexually. The next day, despairing, he attempts suicide, but is saved. A young doctor at the hospital explains to Milo\u0161 that [[Premature ejaculation|''ejaculatio praecox'']] is normal at his age, recommending that Milo\u0161 \"think of something else\", such as football, and seek out an experienced woman to help him through his first sexual experience.\n\nDuring the nightshift, Hubi\u010dka flirts with the young telegraphist, Zdeni\u010dka, and imprints her thighs and buttocks with the office's rubber stamps. Her mother sees the stamps and complains to Hubi\u010dka's superiors.\n\nThe Germans and their collaborators are on edge, since their trains and railroad tracks are being attacked by [[Resistance in the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia#Partisan warfare|partisans]]. A glamorous resistance agent, code-named Viktoria Freie, delivers a time bomb to Hubi\u010dka for use in blowing up a large ammunition train. At Hubi\u010dka's request, the \"experienced\" Viktoria also helps Milo\u0161 to resolve his sexual problem.\n\nThe next day, at the crucial moment when the ammunition train is approaching the station, Hubi\u010dka is caught up in a farcical disciplinary hearing, overseen by Zedn\u00ed\u010dek, over his rubber-stamping of Zdeni\u010dka's backside. In Hubi\u010dka's place, Milo\u0161, liberated from his former passivity by his experience with Viktoria, takes the time bomb and drops it onto the train from a [[railway signal#Signal mounting|semaphore gantry]], which extends transversely above the tracks. A machine-gunner on the train, spotting Milo\u0161, sprays him with bullets, and his body falls onto the train.\n\nZedn\u00ed\u010dek winds up the disciplinary hearing by dismissing the Czech people as \"nothing but laughing hyenas\" (a phrase actually employed by the senior Nazi official [[Reinhard Heydrich]]<ref name=\"Hames, Peter 2005\">Hames, Peter. ''The Czechoslovak New Wave''. Second Edition, 2005, London and New York, Wallflower Press.</ref>). The stationmaster is despondent because the scandal with Hubi\u010dka and Zdeni\u010dka seems to have frustrated his ambition of being promoted to inspector. Then a huge series of explosions happens just around a bend in the track as the train is destroyed by the bomb.<ref>{{cite book |title=\u010cesk\u00fd hran\u00fd film IV./Czech Feature Film IV.

Menzel considered playing the role himself, but he concluded that, at almost 28, he was too old. Fifteen non-professional actors were then tested before the wife of Ladislav Fikar (a poet and publisher) came up with the suggestion of the pop singer [[V\u00e1clav Neck\u00e1\u0159]].<ref name=\"Hames\"/> Menzel has related that he himself only took on the cameo role of the doctor at the last minute, after the actor originally cast failed to show up for shooting.\n\nFilming began in late February and lasted until the end of April 1966.

Crowther wrote:<blockquote>What it appears Mr. Menzel is aiming at all through his film is just a wonderfully sly, sardonic picture of the embarrassments of a youth coming of age in a peculiarly innocent yet worldly provincial environment. ... The charm of his film is in the quietness and slyness of his earthy comedy, the wonderful finesse of understatements, the wise and humorous understanding of primal sex. And it is in the brilliance with which he counterpoints the casual affairs of his country characters with the realness, the urgency and significance of those passing trains.<ref>{{Cite web|author-link=Bosley Crowther|last=Crowther|first=Bosley|date=1967-10-16|url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9804E0D9123BE53BBC4E52DFB667838C679EDE|title=Closely Watched T/rains (1966)|work=[[The New York Times]]|access-date=2011-10-07}}</ref></blockquote> ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]''{{'}}s reviewer wrote:<blockquote>The 28-year-old Jiri Menzel registers a remarkable directorial debut. His sense for witty situations is as impressive as his adroit handling of the players. A special word of praise must go to [[Bohumil Hrabal]], the creator of the literary original; the many amusing gags and imaginative situations are primarily his. The cast is composed of wonderful types down the line.<ref>{{Cite web|author=Staff writer|year=1966|url=https://www.variety.com/review/VE1117793773?refcatid=31|title=Ostre Sledovane Vlaky|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|access-date=2011-10-07}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn his study of the [[Czechoslovak New Wave]], Peter Hames places the film in a broader context, connecting it to, among other things, the most famous anti-hero of Czech literature, [[Jaroslav Ha\u0161ek]]'s ''[[The Good Soldier \u0160vejk]]'', a fictional [[World War I]] soldier whose artful evasion of duty and undermining of authority are sometimes held to epitomize characteristic Czech qualities:\n\n<blockquote>In its attitudes, if not its form, ''Closely Observed Trains'' is the Czech film that comes closest to the humour and satire of ''The Good Soldier \u0160vejk'', not least because it is prepared to include the reality of the war as a necessary aspect of its comic vision. The attack on ideological dogmatism, bureaucracy and anachronistic moral values undoubtedly strikes wider targets than the period of Nazi Occupation. However, it would be wrong to reduce the film to a coded reflection on contemporary Czech society: the attitudes and ideas derive from the same conditions that originally inspired Ha\u0161ek. Insofar as these conditions recur, under the Nazi Occupation or elsewhere, the response will be the same.<ref name=\"Hames\"/></blockquote>\n\n==Awards and honors==\n[[File:Oscar statue.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Academy Award]] statue awarded to this film.]]\n\nThe film won several international awards:\n\n* The [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film]], awarded in 1968 for films released in 1967<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6gyakVlsyc \"Closely Watched Trains\" Wins Foreign Language Film: 1968 Oscars]</ref>\n* The Grand Prize at the 1966 [[International Filmfestival Mannheim-Heidelberg|Mannheim-Heidelberg International Filmfestival]]\n* A nomination for the 1968 [[BAFTA Award]]s for Best Film and Best Soundtrack\n* A nomination for the 1968 [[DGA Award]] for Outstanding Directorial Achievement in Motion Pictures\n* A nomination for the 1967 [[Golden Globe]] for Best Foreign-Language Foreign Film\n\n==See also==\n* [[Czechoslovak New Wave]]\n* [[List of submissions to the 40th Academy Awards for Best Foreign Language Film]]\n* [[List of Czechoslovakia submissions for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film]]\n\n==References==\n;Notes\n{{Reflist}}\n\n;Bibliography\n* Hames, Peter.
