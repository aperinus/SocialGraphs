It stars [[Hilary Swank]] as [[Julie Pierce]] (in her first theatrical appearance in a starring role) and [[Pat Morita]] as [[Mr. Miyagi]].\n\n''The Next Karate Kid'' was directed by [[Christopher Cain]], written by Mark Lee, produced by [[Jerry Weintraub]], and with music by [[Bill Conti]]. It is the first film in the series not to feature [[Ralph Macchio]] in the lead role as [[Daniel LaRusso]], and was released on September 9, 1994.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, the plot summary should be 400-700 words. -->\n[[Mr. Miyagi]] travels to [[Arlington National Cemetery]] for a commendation for [[Japanese-Americans]] who fought in the [[442nd Infantry Regiment (United States)|442nd Regimental Combat Team]] during [[World War II]]. He meets Louisa Pierce, the widow of his commanding officer, Jack. At Pierce's home in [[Boston]], they catch up. Miyagi is also introduced to Pierce's granddaughter, [[List of The Karate Kid characters#Julie Pierce|Julie]], a teen struggling with anger issues due to her parents' death in a car accident. Her behaviour has led to friction between Julie and her grandmother, along with her fellow students and teachers. She sneaks into the school at night to care for an injured [[Harris's hawk]] named \"Angel\", which she keeps in a pigeon coop on the roof.\n\nMiyagi invites Louisa to stay at his house in Los Angeles to enjoy peace and quiet tending his garden while he remains in Boston as Julie's caretaker. At school, Julie meets and befriends Eric McGowen, a teenage security guard-in-training and a pledge for a shady school security [[fraternity]], the Alpha Elite. The members are taught to enforce the school rules, mostly using physical force, by a self-styled colonel, Paul Dugan. His toughest and most aggressive student is the short-fused Ned Randall, who makes unwelcome sexual advances upon Julie.\n\nWhen Julie survives almost being hit by a car by jumping into a [[Taekwondo stances|tiger position]], she finally learns to confide in Miyagi when he recognizes her skill. She reveals she was taught karate by her father, who learned from her grandfather, Miyagi's student.\n\nWhile trying to feed Angel one night, Julie is detected by the Alpha Elite who chase her through the school. Although she escapes them, she is arrested by the police and gets suspended for two weeks by Dugan. Miyagi uses this time to take Julie to a [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] [[monastery]] to teach her the true ways of karate and how to handle her anger issues. Julie learns through direct lessons about balance, coordination, awareness and respect for all life. She befriends the monks, who eventually have a birthday party for her, giving her a cake and an arrow that Miyagi had caught in mid-flight in a demonstration of [[Zen in the Art of Archery|Zen archery]]. They also concede to her wish that they visit her in Boston, where they go bowling with Miyagi. A local player challenges them, loses the match, and accepts their tutelage in how to bowl a strike blind.\n\nUpon returning to school, Julie discovers that Angel was found by Ned who called animal control. Miyagi assists Julie in releasing the bird back to the wild, using [[Reiki|the pain suppression technique from the first film]] to heal her broken wing. In preparation for the [[prom]], Miyagi teaches Julie how to dance, and buys her a dress. Julie goes to the prom with Eric, but under Dugan's orders, the Alpha Elite bungee jump in. When one of the members breaks his arm, Eric shows concern, but Ned tells him to stay out of it.\n\nEric drives Julie home and kisses her. Ned follows them and smashes the windows of Eric's car with a baseball bat. Ned challenges him to a fight at the docks, and is joined there by Dugan and the Alpha Elite. They set fire to Eric's car and severely beat him, but he is saved by Julie and Miyagi. Ned tries to grab Julie, but she challenges him to a fight. She holds her own, using the karate she has learned, even when Ned throws sand in her face. Julie defeats Ned and turns her back on him. Dugan bullies the rest of the group to continue the fight, but they refuse. Miyagi challenges Dugan to fight and wins, leading the Alpha Elite to abandon him. The film concludes with Angel flying freely above the water.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Main|List of The Karate Kid and Cobra Kai characters}}\n* [[Pat Morita|Noriyuki \"Pat\" Morita]] as [[Mr. Miyagi]]\n* [[Hilary Swank]] as [[List of The Karate Kid and Cobra Kai characters#Julie Pierce|Julie Pierce]]\n* [[Michael Ironside]] as [[List of The Karate Kid and Cobra Kai characters#Colonel Dugan|Colonel Paul Dugan]]\n* [[Constance Towers]] as [[List of The Karate Kid and Cobra Kai characters#Louisa Pierce|Louisa Pierce]]\n* [[Chris Conrad (actor)|Chris Conrad]] as [[List of The Karate Kid and Cobra Kai characters#Eric McGowen|Eric McGowen]]\n* Michael Cavalieri as [[List of The Karate Kid and Cobra Kai characters#Ned Randall|Ned Randall]]\n* Tom Downey as [[List of The Karate Kid and Cobra Kai characters#Morgan|Morgan]]\n* [[Walton Goggins]] as [[List of The Karate Kid and Cobra Kai characters#Charlie|Charlie]]\n* [[Frank Welker]] as Angel the Hawk (voice)\n* Arsenio 'Sonny' Trinidad as [[List of The Karate Kid and Cobra Kai characters#Abbot|Abbot Monk]]\n* [[Daniel Inouye]] as Senator\n\n==Reception {{anchor|Critics}}==\n''The Next Karate Kid'' was critically panned upon release in 1994,<ref>{{cite news|title= 'Last': A Clear Remembrance of 'Karate Kid' Past |work= Los Angeles Times|date=1994-09-12|url= https://articles.latimes.com/1994-09-12/entertainment/ca-47633_1_karate-kid|access-date=2010-08-25}}</ref> although many critics praised Swank\u2019s performance, and it is still considered to be her breakout role.\n\nAt the [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], it holds an approval of 7% with an average score of 3.70/10 based on 27 reviews.
