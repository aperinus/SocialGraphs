Stalingrad received the I3DS (International 3D and Advanced Imaging Society) Jury Award for Russia in 2014.\n\nThe film is a love story set in November 1942 during the [[Battle of Stalingrad]], three months into the six month battle that caused nearly 2,000,000 total casualties (wounded, killed, captured) for the two opponents, including tens of thousands of Russian civilians.  The story follows soldiers from both sides as they fight to survive while saving the lives of their loves, and struggle with retaining their humanity in the face of certain death and the unspeakable horrors of war. The plot seems to be somewhat influenced{{clarify|date=January 2019}} by Chapter 57 of ''[[Life and Fate|Life And Fate]]'', by writer and journalist [[Vasily Grossman]], and therefore does have a literary antecedent.\n\n==Plot==\nThe film opens in Japan in the wake of the [[2011 T\u014dhoku earthquake and tsunami]].  As emergency personnel work to reach some victims trapped underground, one rescuer tries to keep the victims calm by telling the story of how he came to have five fathers, all killed during [[Eastern Front (World War II)|the Great Patriotic War]] (World War II).  The trapped victims are young German students and the rescuers are Russian.\n\nIn 1942, after the initial attack on Stalingrad, a small group of Russian soldiers take cover in a large five story residential building that happens to provide cover for a Russian crossing point on the [[Volga River]]. Five of these soldiers become the five fathers in the story: Polyakov (\"Angel\") who had become embittered when his wife and daughter were killed in an air raid; Chvanov, whose hatred of the Germans comes from their cruel treatment and methodical murder of his family; Nikiforov, a talented [[tenor]] singer before the war, who had become a cruel and vicious fighter; Sergey, drafted into the war as a spotter; and Captain Gromov, a veteran and hero who leads the group after finding them.  The soldiers encounter a young girl named Katya, living alone in the building after her family had been killed. As they spend the next few days together, the soldiers grow fond of her, and she of them.\n\nGermans encamped near the crossing are led by [[Hauptmann]] Kahn; a highly decorated, but disillusioned soldier who falls in love with a Russian woman named Masha, who resembles his late wife. She at first detests him, but soon begins to reciprocate his love, although they cannot speak each other's language. [[Oberstleutnant]] Henze arrives to take command of the Germans. He chides Kahn both for his attraction to Masha, as well as his failure to eradicate the Russian soldiers. Henze decides to set an example by rounding up the Russian civilians living in the bombed out buildings, then burning a woman and her daughter alive. This enrages the Russian soldiers who ambush the Germans, killing several, but losing several of their own men in the process. The Germans and Russians then retreat to their own shelters to wait the others out. One afternoon, Chvanov teaches Katya how to aim her gun at a German washing himself at a water faucet and startled, accidentally shoots him, which causes retaliation that injures Chvanov.\n\nDuring one of his visits to Masha, Kahn promises to take her to safety when the time comes. On her 19th birthday, Katya is presented with a handmade cake from the soldiers, with a song by Nikiforov, whom she had earlier recognized as a famous singer. She is then given the gift of a bathtub filled with hot water, a luxury no one has experienced since the siege began.  Sergey takes Katya to his old lookout spot, located in a building not occupied by either the Germans or the Russians.  The two spend the night together, creating the narrator of our story.\n\nAfter Polyakov ricocheted an artillery shell into the German complex, Kahn is ordered to begin the attack on them; he takes Masha to an abandoned building, hoping to save her from the coming fight. As she begs him to stay with her, she is shot by Chvanov for being a collaborator, enraging Kahn. Nikiforov is taken captive by the Germans, where he manages to brutally stab Henze before being killed himself. Henze's death puts Kahn back in charge.\n\nGerman reinforcements arrive with [[Panzer IV|tanks]] that have the range to take out the Russian soldiers and their building. They open fire, fatally injuring Chvanov. Kahn and his soldiers attack, shooting Polyakov to death. Kahn then finds Gromov on the second floor trying to use a radio. The two of them shoot each other several times before collapsing. Sergey reaches them and uses the radio to order an air strike on their building, which is being overrun by German soldiers. Katya watches with a broken heart as the building is leveled, leaving no one inside alive.\n\nBack in the present day, the Germans are freed from the building. The girl to whom Sergey (who had been named after his biological father) had told his story seeks him out, and they share a moment of understanding before he is driven away.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Pyotr Fyodorov]] as Capt.

During that time, two key episodes of the battle were shot, in which 900 extras and historical reenactors took part in crowd scenes. The main shooting process began at the end of May 2012 and ran until 27 July 2012.<ref name=\"rian3d\"/><ref name=\"FB\"/>\n\nColossal scenery was constructed especially for Stalingrad filming at the former factory \"Krasny Treugolnik\" in [[Saint Petersburg|St. Petersburg]], and the Third North Fort near [[Kronstadt]]. Every detail for the movie sets depicting the centre of [[Stalingrad]] and the east bank of the [[Volga]] were faithfully and painstakingly reproduced, reflecting the vast scale of the battle. The budget for its construction was more than 120 million [[Russian ruble|rubles]] (US$3.5 million), and it took over 400 people working for 6 months to build. Unusually though, for all the attention to detail the film-makers took, the Panzers reproduced for a major scene late in the film were modeled on a much different later type of the German Mk.IV that did not enter service until around a year after the battle (the Mk.IV G/H)- a major oversight by the historical advisors and production team.<ref name=\"rian3d\"/><ref name=\"FB\"/>\n\nThe film was produced in [[3D film|3D]] using equipment provided by a Hollywood company, [[3ality Technica]].
