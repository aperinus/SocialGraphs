The film was directed by [[Spike Lee]] and premiered on the first [[anniversary]] of the March.<ref name=\"nytimes\">{{cite news | date = October 16, 1996 | author = JANET MASLIN | title = An Anniversary Tribute To the Million Man March | url = https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9502E4D61731F935A25753C1A960958260 | work = [[The New York Times]] }}</ref><ref name=\"latimes\">{{cite news | title = The 'Bus' Stopped Here | date = October 16, 1996| author = JUDY BRENNAN | url = http://articles.latimes.com/1996-10-16/entertainment/ca-54227_1_producer | work = [[Los Angeles Times]] }}</ref> This is the first film directed by Lee in which he does not appear.\n\n==Plot==\n\nFifteen disparate [[African American]] men board a bus in Los Angeles bound for Washington, D.C., where they plan on attending the [[Million Man March]]. Other than their race, destination, and gender, the men have nothing in common: George is the trip organizer; Xavier is an aspiring filmmaker hoping to make a documentary of the March; Flip is the vain but charismatic and openly homophobic and sexist actor; Kyle and Randall are a homosexual couple; Gary, a biracial police officer; Jamal is a former [[gang|gang banger]] turned devout [[Muslim]] who has evaded prosecution for the murders he committed; Evan Jr., is a petty criminal who has been permitted to break probation to attend the march on the condition that he remain handcuffed to his father, Evan Sr.\n\nAs the bus travels across country, Xavier conducts interviews with the various attendees, allowing them to express their views on race, religion, and politics. The interviews often provoke outbursts from other men on the bus, invariably leading to many political confrontations. Jeremiah, the eldest member of the group, is an 80-year-old former alcoholic who lost his job and family, has found new meaning in life and is energized by the Million Man March, and embraces his African heritage; his philosophies on the black experience and stories of precolonial Africa serve to unite the men and ease tensions and the infighting among them.\n\nEn route the bus breaks down and the men are forced to board another bus, driven by an ethnically [[Jewish]] white man named Rick. A couple of the passengers harass Rick as a white man, and Rick ultimately refuses to drive any further, citing the group's prejudice and his opposition to antisemitic remarks made by the leader of the march, [[Louis Farrakhan]]. George, himself a bus driver, accuses Rick of cultural [[racism]], but begrudgingly agrees to cover for Rick, who leaves. George takes over driving for the remainder of the trip, with help from Evan Sr.\n\nAs the bus passes through the American south, the men are greeted hospitably by several white southerners at various restaurants and rest stops. At one stop, the men pick up Wendell, a wealthy African American [[Lexus]] salesman who sees attending the march as a way to make business connections. Wendell, a self-proclaimed conservative Republican, makes disparaging remarks about whom he sees as lazy and stupid African Americans. Though he gets some agreement from Kyle, ultimately the other men perceive Wendell as too insulting and just wanting to make money off the march; they forcibly toss him out of the bus.\n\nIn [[Knoxville]], Tennessee, the bus is pulled over by a pair of racist state troopers, who accuse the men of using the bus to smuggle drugs. The bus and its passengers are checked by a drug-sniffing police dog, turning up no evidence of drugs; the troopers then condescendingly allow the bus to resume its journey.\n\nAs the bus nears Washington, Jeremiah passes out and is rushed to a hospital. The doctors there discover that Jeremiah is suffering from advanced [[coronary artery disease]], which made the stress of the trip potentially deadly for him. Evan Sr. and Jr., Gary, Jamal, and Xavier opt to stay with Jeremiah at the hospital and watch the march on television while the rest of the men leave in the bus to attend. Shortly after they leave, Jeremiah dies. The rest of the group returns to the hospital, saying that, to stay true to the spirit of the March, they chose not to attend the march but to return and be with Jeremiah.\n\nAs the bus prepares to return to Los Angeles, the men find a [[prayer]] that Jeremiah wrote with the intention of praying it when the bus arrived at Washington, D.C. The men drive to the [[Lincoln Memorial]], where George leads the men in Jeremiah's prayer, and the film ends with Evan Jr. and Senior's handcuffs left at the Lincoln memorial.\n\n==Characters==\n* George ([[Charles S.
