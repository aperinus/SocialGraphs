For his performance, Meaney was nominated for the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor \u2013 Motion Picture Musical or Comedy]].\n\n== Plot ==\nSoon after a wild night at the pub, twenty-year-old Sharon Curley finds herself expecting a little \"snapper\" by a man she loathes.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.empireonline.com/movies/reviews/snapper-review/|title=The Snapper|date=2000-01-01|website=Empire|language=en|access-date=2020-03-02}}</ref> Her refusal to name the father sets in motion a family drama involving her three brothers, two sisters, and her parents, along with her employers and all her friends. Kellegher, playing the role as a coarse, earthy, yet remarkably sensible young woman soon discovers who her friends really are, as some people tease and torment her, some make remarks to her siblings, some force her father to take direct action in her defence, and all spread gossip. She decides to keep the baby (\"snapper\") and her family, each in their own way, eventually decides to support her. Her father particularly studies up on childbirth and female anatomy (with gratifying results for his wife as a bonus).\n\nDes Curley,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ifi.ie/film/the-snapper/|title=The Snapper|website=Irish Film Institute|language=en|access-date=2020-03-02}}</ref> Sharon's father, shows the whole world in his face, his emotions ranging from outrage toward Sharon for embarrassing the family to tender concern as her time draws near. As the eight-member family trips all over each other emotionally (symbolised in their battles for the one bathroom, often occupied by Sharon), the tensions within the family grow more intense. Widespread speculation about who the father disrupts the neighbourhood, with some hotheads visiting their own brand of justice on the Curleys. The arrival of the baby offers a chance at resolution.\n\nIt turns out that Sharon's friend's father, Georgie Burgess, got her pregnant after he had sex with a severely inebriated Sharon in a car park. It is suggested that this encounter was nonconsensual. As an inebriated person cannot consent to sex, it was in fact nonconsensual.  Her story is that it was a Spanish sailor, but the whole town suspects the truth that it is Burgess as he writes a letter to his wife apologising for getting a young girl pregnant.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Tina Kellegher]] as Sharon Curley\n* [[Colm Meaney]] as Des Curley\n* [[Brendan Gleeson]] as Lester\n* [[Pat Laffan]] as George Burgess\n* [[Rynagh O'Grady]] as the Neighbour\n* [[Stanley Townsend]] as the Anaesthetist\n* [[Stuart Dunne]] as Bertie\n* [[Barbara Bergin]] as Dawn\n* [[Birdy Sweeney|Birdie Sweeney]] as the Loner\n* [[Cathleen Delany]] as the Oul'One\n* [[Cathy Belton]] as the Desk Nurse\n* [[Tom Murphy (actor)|Tom Murphy]] as the Pal\n* [[Stephen Kennedy (actor)|Stephen Kennedy]] as the Supermarket Trainee Manager\n* [[Roddy Doyle]] as Himself\n* Karen Woodley as Yvonne Burgess\n* [[Virginia Cole]]\tas Doris Burgess\n* Denis Menton as Pat Burgess\n* Peter Rowen as Sonny Curley\n* Eanna MacLiam as Craig Curley\n* Colm O'Byrne as Darren Curley\n* Joanne Gerrard as Lisa Curley\n* Ciara Duffy as Kimberley Curley\n* Deirdre and Dierdre O'Brien as Mary Curley\n* Aisling Conlan and Alannagh McMullen as Baby Curley\n* Sheila Flitton as Missis Twix\n* Jack Lynch as Cancer\n* Ronan Wilmot as Paddy\n* Fionnuala Murphy as Jackie O'Keefe\n{{div col end}}\n\n== Production ==\n\nThe surname of the Rabbitte family in the book had to be changed to Curley as [[20th Century Fox]] owns the rights to the Rabbitte name from ''[[The Commitments (film)|The Commitments]]'' (1991), which featured the same characters.
