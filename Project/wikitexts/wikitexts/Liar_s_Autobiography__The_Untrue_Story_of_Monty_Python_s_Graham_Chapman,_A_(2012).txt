The film is loosely based on ''[[A Liar's Autobiography: Volume VI]]'', a book written by Chapman and [[David Sherlock]]. It received a [[Limited release|limited theatrical release]] on 2 November 2012 in the United States, and aired on the [[Epix (TV channel)|Epix]] TV channel on the same day.\n\n==Voice cast==\n* [[Graham Chapman]] as himself\n* [[Terry Gilliam]] as Graham's psychiatrist\n* [[John Cleese]] as [[David Frost]]\n* [[Michael Palin]] as Graham's father\n* [[Terry Jones]] as Graham's mother\n* [[Cameron Diaz]] as [[Sigmund Freud]]\n* Philip Bulcock as [[David Sherlock]]\n* [[Justin McDonald]] as young David Sherlock\n* Andr\u00e9 Jacquemin as himself\n* Margarita Doyle as [[Sylvia Kristel]]\n\nVarious characters voiced by Palin, Jones, Cleese, [[Carol Cleveland]], and [[Stephen Fry]].\n\n==Production==\nIn June 2011, it was announced that Bill and Ben Productions were making ''A Liar's Autobiography'', an animated 3D film based on the memoir.<ref name=\"Tribute\">{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/27/movies/graham-chapman-tribute-from-monty-python.html | work=The New York Times | first=Michael | last=Cieply | title=Graham Chapman Tribute From Monty Python | date=26 June 2011}}</ref> The full name is ''A Liar's Autobiography: The Untrue Story of Monty Python's Graham Chapman''. Although not a Monty Python film, all but one of the remaining Pythons are involved in the project. Asked what was true in a deliberately fanciful account by Chapman of his life, [[Terry Jones]] joked: \"Nothing... it's all a downright, absolute, blackguardly lie.\"\n\nThe film uses Chapman's own voice&mdash;from a reading of his autobiography shortly before he died of cancer&mdash;and entertainment channel [[Epix (TV channel)|EPIX]] has announced that the film is in both 2D and 3D formats. Produced and directed by London-based Bill Jones, Jeff Simpson, and Ben Timlett, the film used 14 animation companies, each working on chapters that range from 3 to 12 minutes in length, with each chapter in a different style similar to ''[[Op\u00e9ra imaginaire]]''.\n\n[[John Cleese]] recorded dialogue which was matched with Chapman's voice. [[Michael Palin]] voiced Chapman's father and [[Terry Jones]] voiced his mother. [[Terry Gilliam]] voiced his psychiatrist. They all play various other roles. Among the original Python group, only [[Eric Idle]] was not involved, although he can be seen during footage of John Cleese's eulogy at Chapman's memorial service near the end of the film.<ref name=\"Tribute\"/>\n\n==Release==\n''A Liar's Autobiography'' was first screened at the [[2012 Toronto International Film Festival]] in September 2012 and premiered in the UK on 16 October 2012 as part of the [[BFI London Film Festival]]. The film's [[Trailer (promotion)|official trailer]] claims that Chapman said, \"This is the best film I've been in since I died.\"<ref name=\"Tribute\"/>\n\n==Reception==\nThe film received mixed reviews from critics. {{RT data|as of|y|m}}, it holds {{a or an|{{RT data|score}}}} approval rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]], based on {{RT data|count}} reviews with an average rating of {{RT data|average}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/a_liars_autobiography_the_untrue_story_of_monty_pythons_graham_chapman|title=A Liar's Autobiography - The Untrue Story of Monty Python's Graham Chapman (2012)|website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|publisher=[[Fandango Media|Fandango]]|access-date={{RT data|access date|df=dmy}}}}{{RT data|edit}}</ref> On [[Metacritic]], the film has a 45/100 rating, signifying \"mixed or average reviews\".<ref>{{Metacritic film|title=A Liar's Autobiography: The Untrue Story of Monty Python's Graham Chapman}} Retrieved 15 July 2013</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|1979172|A Liar's Autobiography: The Untrue Story of Monty Python's Graham Chapman}}\n* {{mojo title|liarsautobiography|A Liar's Autobiography: The Untrue Story of Monty Python's Graham Chapman}}\n* {{rotten-tomatoes|a_liars_autobiography_the_untrue_story_of_monty_pythons_graham_chapman|A Liar's Autobiography: The Untrue Story of Monty Python's Graham Chapman}}\n* {{Metacritic film|title=A Liar's Autobiography: The Untrue Story of Monty Python's Graham Chapman}}\n\n{{Monty Python}}\n{{Graham Chapman}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Liar's Autobiography: The Untrue Story Of Monty Python's Graham Chapman, A}}\n[[Category:Monty Python]]\n[[Category:2012 films]]\n[[Category:2012 3D films]]\n[[Category:3D animated films]]\n[[Category:2012 animated films]]\n[[Category:2012 comedy films]]\n[[Category:British 3D films]]\n[[Category:British animated films]]\n[[Category:British LGBT-related films]]\n[[Category:British comedy films]]\n[[Category:2012 LGBT-related films]]\n[[Category:British independent films]]\n[[Category:Animated comedy films]]\n[[Category:LGBT-related animated films]]\n[[Category:Animated films based on literature]]\n[[Category:Male bisexuality in film]]\n[[Category:Biographical films about LGBT people]]\n[[Category:2010s English-language films]]\n[[Category:2010s British films]]"}]}}}}
