It was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Picture]], and Stuhlbarg was nominated for a [[Golden Globe Award]].\n\n==Plot==\nA [[Jewish]] man in a 19th-century Eastern European [[shtetl]] tells his wife that he was helped on his way home by Reb Groshkover, whom he has invited in for soup. She says Groshkover is dead and the man he invited must be a [[dybbuk]]. Groshkover arrives and laughs off the accusation, but she plunges an ice pick into his chest. Bleeding, he exits their home into the snowy night.\n\nIn 1967, Larry Gopnik is a professor of physics living in [[St. Louis Park, Minnesota]]. His wife, Judith, tells him that she needs a [[Get (divorce document)|''get'']] so she can marry widower Sy Ableman, with whom she has fallen in love. Meanwhile, their son Danny owes twenty dollars to an intimidating [[Hebrew school]] classmate for marijuana. He has the money, but it is hidden in a transistor radio that was confiscated by his teacher. Their daughter, Sarah, is always washing her hair, going out and avoiding school. Larry's brother, Arthur, is homeless and sleeps on the couch, spending his free time filling a notebook with what he calls a \"probability map of the universe\" or a \"mentaculus\".\n\nClive Park, a South Korean student worried about losing his scholarship, meets with Larry in his office to argue he should not fail the class. After he leaves, Larry finds an envelope stuffed with cash. When Larry attempts to return it, Clive's father threatens to sue Larry either for defamation if Larry accuses Clive of bribery, or for keeping the money if he does not give him a passing grade. Larry faces an impending vote on his application for tenure, and his department head informs him that anonymous letters have urged the committee to deny him.\n\nAt the insistence of Judith and Sy, Larry and Arthur move into a nearby motel. Judith empties the couple's bank accounts, leaving Larry penniless, so he enlists the services of a divorce attorney. Larry learns that Arthur faces charges of solicitation and sodomy.\n\nLarry turns to his Jewish faith for consolation. He consults a junior rabbi, who advises Larry to change his \"perspective\". Larry and Sy are involved in separate, simultaneous car crashes. Larry is unharmed, but Sy dies. Larry consults a second rabbi for solace, who recounts a parable about a dentist who finds Hebrew inscriptions on a patient's teeth. Larry also tries to contact Marshak, the synagogue's senior rabbi, who isn't available. At Judith's insistence, Larry pays for Sy's funeral. At the funeral, Sy is eulogized as \"a serious man\".\n\nLarry calls on his neighbor, Vivienne Samsky, whom he has seen sunbathing naked. She introduces him to marijuana. He later dreams that he is having sex with her, but this turns into a nightmare.\n\nArthur is despondent about the charges levied at him, and Larry consoles him. Larry then has another nightmare in which he gives Arthur the money Clive left him and drives him to cross into Canada by boat, whereupon his neighbors shoot Arthur in the neck. Larry is proud and moved by Danny's [[Bar and Bat Mitzvah|Bar Mitzvah]], unaware that his son is under the influence of marijuana. During the service, Judith apologizes to Larry for all the recent trouble and informs him that Sy respected him so much that he even wrote letters to the tenure committee. Danny meets with Marshak, a brief encounter in which Marshak only quotes [[Jefferson Airplane]]'s \"[[Somebody to Love (Jefferson Airplane song)|Somebody to Love]]\", names some members of the band, returns the radio, and tells Danny to \"be a good boy\".\n\nLarry's department head compliments him on Danny's Bar Mitzvah and hints that he will receive tenure. The mail brings a $3,000 bill from Arthur's lawyer. Larry decides to change Clive's grade from F to C\u2212, whereupon Larry's doctor calls, asking to see him immediately about the results of a chest X-ray. Meanwhile, Danny's teacher struggles to open the emergency shelter as a massive tornado closes in on the school.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Michael Stuhlbarg]] as Lawrence \"Larry\" Gopnik\n* [[Richard Kind]] as Arthur Gopnik\n* [[Fred Melamed]] as Sy Ableman\n* [[Sari Lennick]] as Judith Gopnik\n* Aaron Wolff as Danny Gopnik\n* Jessica McManus as Sarah Gopnik\n* [[Alan Mandell]] as Rabbi Marshak\n* [[Adam Arkin]] as Don Milgram\n* [[George Wyner]] as Rabbi Nachtner\n* [[Amy Landecker]] as Mrs. Vivienne Samsky\n* Peter Breitmayer as Mr. Brandt\n* Brent Braunschweig as Mitch Brandt \n* Katherine Borowitz as Mimi Nudell\n* Allen Lewis Rickman as Velvel\n* Yelena Shmulenson as Dora\n* [[Fyvush Finkel]] as Traitl Groshkover\n* [[Simon Helberg]] as Rabbi Scott Ginsler\n* [[Raye Birk]] as Dr. Shapiro\n* [[Michael Lerner (actor)|Michael Lerner]] as Solomon Schlutz\n* David Kang as Clive\n* [[Steve Park (comedian)|Steve Park]] as Clive's father\n* [[Ari Hoptman]] as Arlen Finkle\n* Amanda Day as Art Student\n* Landyn Banx as Actor{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\nConsiderable attention was paid to the setting; it was important to the Coens to find a neighborhood of original-looking suburban [[ranch-style house|rambler homes]] as they would have appeared in [[St. Louis Park, Minnesota]], in the late 1960s.
