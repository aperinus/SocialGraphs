[[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] Regional Bureau Chief [[List of Twin Peaks characters#Gordon Cole|Gordon Cole]] sends agents [[List of Twin Peaks characters#Chester Desmond|Chester Desmond]] and [[List of Twin Peaks characters#FBI Special Agent Sam Stanley|Sam Stanley]] to investigate. At a small airport where Lil, a woman wearing a red dress with a blue rose pinned to the chest, performs a cryptic \"dance\". Desmond later explains to Stanley this contains coded information about the case, but refuses to explain the rose.\n\nThe agents meet the local law enforcement, Sheriff Cable and Deputy Cliff, who are hostile to the FBI. While examining Teresa's body at the morgue, the agents notice that a ring is missing from her finger, and find a small piece of paper with the letter \"T\" inserted under the fingernail. Past 3 AM, the agents interview the elderly owner of Hap's Diner, then the decrepit waitress, Irene, who recalls that Teresa's arm went numb before she died. At dawn, the agents visit Fat Trout Trailer Park and awaken the manager, [[List of Twin Peaks characters#Carl Rodd|Carl Rodd]], to inspect Teresa's trailer. Inside, Desmond notices a photo of Teresa wearing a strange ring. Later, the agents arrange for Teresa's body to be taken to Portland, defying Sheriff Cable. At dusk, Desmond returns to Fat Trout alone and finds Teresa's ring on a mound under a trailer. He reaches out to take it.\n\nAt FBI headquarters in [[Philadelphia]], Agent [[Dale Cooper]] tells Cole of his foreboding dream, while [[List of Twin Peaks characters#Albert Rosenfield|Agent Albert Rosenfield]] sits nearby. Their long-lost colleague, [[List of Twin Peaks characters#Phillip Jeffries|Agent Phillip Jeffries]], materializes out of the elevator and marches into Cole's office and insanely rants about a meeting he witnessed involving mysterious spirits. A vision of these spirits\u2014The Jumping Man, [[The Man from Another Place]], [[Killer BOB]], Mrs. Chalfont and her grandson\u2014appears briefly before Jeffries vanishes. Albert reports from the front desk that Jeffries was never there and Desmond has disappeared. Cole sends Cooper to Deer Meadow after Desmond. Aside from finding Desmond's abandoned vehicle at Fat Trout, he learns nothing.\n\n===The Last Seven Days of Laura Palmer===\nOne year later in Twin Peaks, high school homecoming queen [[Laura Palmer]] and her best friend [[Donna Hayward]] attend school. Laura uses [[cocaine]] and cheats on her boyfriend [[List of Twin Peaks characters#Bobby Briggs|Bobby Briggs]] with biker [[List of Twin Peaks characters#James Hurley|James Hurley]]. She discovers that pages are missing from her secret diary, and gives the rest of it to her [[agoraphobic]] friend [[List of Twin Peaks characters#Harold Smith|Harold Smith]] for safekeeping.\n\nOutside the Double-R Diner, Mrs. Chalfont and her grandson appear to Laura. They present a small framed picture for her wall, and warn her that the \"man behind the mask\" is in her bedroom. Laura runs home, where she sees BOB behind her dresser. She rushes outside in terror and sees her father, [[Leland Palmer|Leland]], emerge from the house. That evening before dinner, Leland accusingly questions Laura about her romances and screams at her to wash her hands. At bedtime, he offers her a tearful apology.\n\nAt bedtime, Laura hangs the picture on her wall. She dreams about entering the [[Black and White Lodges|Lodge]]. Cooper and the Man from Another Place appear in her dream. The Man from Another Place identifies himself as the arm and offers Teresa's ring to Laura. Cooper tells her not to take it. Laura sees [[List of Twin Peaks characters#Annie Blackburn|Annie Blackburn]] next to her in bed, covered in blood. Annie tells Laura to write in her diary that \"the good Dale is in the Lodge and cannot leave,\" then disappears. Laura sees the ring in her hand, but when she wakes up, it is gone.\n\nThat night, Laura goes to The Roadhouse, a bar in Twin Peaks, where she works as an [[underage]] [[prostitute]]. From there, Laura and her [[pimp]] [[List of Twin Peaks characters#Jacques Renault|Jacques Renault]], along with two of their clients, relocate to The Power and Glory, a bar just over the border in Canada. Donna, who is naive to prostitution and hard drug use, follows Laura there and crashes the group. Laura is disturbed and upset once after spotting Donna is still present. [[List of Twin Peaks characters#Ronette Pulaski|Ronette Pulaski]], another underage prostitute, joins them there. Ronette remembers Teresa Banks' murder and discusses it with the group. When Laura sees a drugged and topless Donna making out with her \"John\", she drags her off and begs Donna not to become like her.\n\nThe next morning, while Leland and Laura drive to breakfast, Philip Gerard, the one-armed man possessed by the spirit [[MIKE]], pulls up alongside the car. He shows Teresa's ring to Laura while accosting Leland about canned corn. Leland remembers his affair with Teresa. He had asked Teresa to set up a [[Foursome (group sex)|foursome]] with her friends, but fled after glimpsing Laura among them. Teresa realized who he was and plotted to blackmail him, but Leland murdered her. Laura watches as her father and MIKE yell and rev their car engines, producing screeching noise and burning the rubber of their car tires. Laura appears greatly disturbed and ultimately screams at them to stop. MIKE peels off and drives away.\n\nThat night, Bobby and Laura are alone together in a forest, waiting for Jacques' drug contact. They are approached by Deputy Cliff, who produces a package of white powder. He fumbles to draw a gun, but Bobby shoots first, splattering Cliff's brains and killing him.\n\nThe next night at bedtime, while Laura is high on cocaine, the spirit BOB comes through Laura's window and rapes her. She asks, \"Who are you?\" and sees that BOB is her father.\n\nLaura attends school in distress. Later, Bobby decides Laura is using him for cocaine access and breaks up with her. Laura is increasingly erratic and disturbed. At night, she meets with James in the forest and they engage in a cryptic and distressed conversation. After ending her relationship with him, she jumps off his motorcycle and escapes to a cabin in the woods, where Ronette, Jacques, and [[List of Twin Peaks characters#Leo Johnson|Leo Johnson]] are waiting. The four take cocaine and have sex. In the process, Jacques ties Laura up against her will. She is screaming and wants to leave, but Jacques rapes her. Leland shows up and beats Jacques unconscious. Leo flees. Leland takes Laura and Ronette to an abandoned train car. Laura asks Leland if he is going to kill her. BOB tells her that he wants to be her. BOB pummels Ronette unconscious. MIKE, having tracked Leland to the train, rescues Ronette and tosses Teresa's ring into the train car. Laura wears it. Enraged, BOB kills Laura. BOB-possessed Leland sends Laura's body, wrapped in plastic, floating down a river, then enters a circle of saplings. He passes into the [[Red Room (Twin Peaks)|Red Room]], where he encounters MIKE and the Man from Another Place. Together they demand their \"garmonbozia\" (translated onscreen as \"pain and sorrow\") from BOB, as a separated Leland floats beside, unaware.\n\n===Epilogue===\n[[Pilot (Twin Peaks)|Laura's dead body is discovered and unwrapped by the residents of Twin Peaks]]. Agent Cooper stands beside and comforts Laura in the Red Room. Laura sees her angel floating above and cries tears of joy.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Further|List of Twin Peaks characters}}\n{{Cast list|\n* [[Sheryl Lee]] as [[Laura Palmer]]\n* [[Ray Wise]] as [[Leland Palmer]]\n* [[Kyle MacLachlan]] as Special Agent [[Dale Cooper]]\n* [[M\u00e4dchen Amick]] as [[Shelly Johnson (Twin Peaks)|Shelly Johnson]]\n* [[Dana Ashbrook]] as [[List of Twin Peaks characters#Bobby Briggs|Bobby Briggs]]\n* [[Phoebe Augustine]] as [[List of Twin Peaks characters#Ronette Pulaski|Ronette Pulaski]]\n* [[David Bowie]] as Special Agent [[List of Twin Peaks characters#Phillip Jeffries|Phillip Jeffries]]\n* [[Eric Da Re]] as [[List of Twin Peaks characters#Leo Johnson|Leo Johnson]]\n* [[Miguel Ferrer]] as Special Agent [[List of Twin Peaks characters#Albert Rosenfield|Albert Rosenfield]]\n* [[Pamela Gidley]] as [[List of Twin Peaks characters#Teresa Banks|Teresa Banks]]\n* [[Heather Graham]] as [[List of Twin Peaks characters#Annie Blackburn|Annie Blackburn]]\n* [[Chris Isaak]] as Special Agent [[List of Twin Peaks characters#Chester Desmond|Chester Desmond]]\n* [[Moira Kelly]] as [[Donna Hayward]]\n* [[Peggy Lipton]] as [[List of Twin Peaks characters#Norma Jennings|Norma Jennings]]\n* [[David Lynch]] as Bureau Chief [[List of Twin Peaks characters#Gordon Cole|Gordon Cole]]\n* [[James Marshall (actor)|James Marshall]] as [[List of Twin Peaks characters#James Hurley|James Hurley]]\n* [[J\u00fcrgen Prochnow]] as Woodsman\n* [[Harry Dean Stanton]] as [[List of Twin Peaks characters#Carl Rodd|Carl Rodd]]\n* [[Kiefer Sutherland]] as Special Agent [[List of Twin Peaks characters#FBI Special Agent Sam Stanley|Sam Stanley]]\n* [[Lenny Von Dohlen]] as [[List of Twin Peaks characters#Harold Smith|Harold Smith]]\n* [[Grace Zabriskie]] as [[List of Twin Peaks characters#Sarah Palmer|Sarah Palmer]]\n* [[Frances Bay]] as Mrs. Tremond / Mrs. Chalfont\n* [[Catherine E.

MacLachlan's reluctance was also caused by a decline of quality in the second season of the show. He said \"David and Mark [Frost] were only around for the first season...
