He is concerned that his 1863 [[Emancipation Proclamation]] may be discarded by the courts after the war and that the proposed [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Thirteenth Amendment]] will be defeated by the returning [[slave states]]. He feels it imperative to pass the amendment beforehand, to remove any possibility that freed slaves might be re-enslaved.\n\nThe [[Radical Republicans]] fear the amendment will be defeated by some who wish to delay its passage; support from Republicans in the [[Border states (American Civil War)|border states]] is not yet assured. The amendment also requires the support of several [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] congressmen to pass. With dozens of Democrats being [[Lame duck (politics)|lame ducks]] after losing their [[1864 and 1865 United States House of Representatives elections|re-election campaigns in the fall of 1864]], some of Lincoln's advisors believe he should wait for a new Republican-heavy [[38th United States Congress|Congress]]. Lincoln remains adamant about having the amendment in place before the war is concluded and the southern states are re-admitted.\n\nLincoln's hopes rely upon [[Francis Preston Blair]], a founder of the Republican Party whose influence could win over members of the border state conservative faction. With [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] victory in the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] highly likely but not yet secured, and with two sons serving in the Union Army, Blair is keen to end hostilities quickly before the spring thaw arrives and the armies march again. Therefore, in return for his support, Blair insists that Lincoln allow him to engage the [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] government in peace negotiations. However, Lincoln knows that significant support for the amendment comes from Radical Republicans, for whom negotiated peace is unacceptable. Unable to proceed without Blair's support, Lincoln reluctantly authorizes Blair's mission.\n\nIn the meantime, Lincoln and [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[William H. Seward|William Seward]] work to secure Democratic votes for the amendment. Lincoln suggests they concentrate on the lame-duck Democrats, as they will feel freer to vote as they choose and soon need employment; Lincoln will have many federal jobs to fill as he begins his second term. Though Lincoln and Seward are unwilling to offer monetary [[bribe]]s to the Democrats, they authorize agents to contact Democratic congressmen with offers of federal jobs in exchange for their support. Meanwhile, Lincoln's son, [[Robert Todd Lincoln|Robert]], returns from [[Harvard Law School|law school]] and announces his intention to discontinue his studies and enlist in the Union Army, hoping to earn a measure of honor and respect outside of his father's shadow before the war's end. Lincoln reluctantly secures an officer's commission for Robert. [[Mary Todd Lincoln|The First Lady]] is aghast, fearing that he will be killed. She furiously presses her husband to pass the amendment and end the war, promising woe upon him if he should fail.\n\nAt a critical moment in the debate in the House of Representatives, racial-equality advocate [[Thaddeus Stevens]] agrees to moderate his position and argue that the amendment represents only ''legal'' equality, not a declaration of ''actual'' equality. Meanwhile, Confederate envoys are ready to meet with Lincoln to discuss terms for peace, but he instructs they be kept out of [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]] as the amendment approaches a vote on the House floor. Rumor of their mission circulates, prompting both Democrats and conservative Republicans to advocate postponing the vote. In a carefully worded statement, Lincoln denies there are envoys ''in Washington'', and the vote proceeds, passing by a margin of just two votes. Black visitors to the gallery celebrate, and Stevens returns home to [[Lydia Hamilton Smith|his \"housekeeper\" and lover]], a biracial woman.\n\nWhen Lincoln [[Hampton Roads Conference|meets with the Confederates]], he tells them slavery cannot be restored, as the North is united for ratification of the amendment, and several of the southern states' reconstructed legislatures would also vote to ratify. As a result, the peace negotiations fail, and the war continues. On April 3, Lincoln visits [[Petersburg National Battlefield|the battlefield]] at [[Petersburg, Virginia]], where he exchanges a few words with Lieutenant General [[Ulysses S. Grant]]. On April 9, Grant receives General [[Robert E. Lee]]'s surrender at [[Battle of Appomattox Court House|Appomattox Courthouse]]. On April 14, a cheerful Lincoln expresses to his wife that they will be happy in the future and later meets members of his cabinet to discuss future measures to [[enfranchisement|enfranchise]] blacks, before [[Assassination of Abraham Lincoln|leaving for Ford's Theatre]]. That night, while Lincoln's son [[Tad Lincoln|Tad]] is watching ''[[Aladdin|<!-- don't delink -->Aladdin and the Wonderful Lamp]]'' at [[National Theatre (Washington, D.C.)|Grover's Theatre]], the manager suddenly stops the play to announce that the President has been shot. The next morning, at the [[Petersen House]], Lincoln dies with a peaceful expression across his face; in a flashback, Lincoln finishes his [[Abraham Lincoln's second inaugural address|second inaugural address]] on March 4.\n\n== Cast ==\n'''Lincoln household'''\n* [[Daniel Day-Lewis]] as [[President of the United States|United States President]] [[Abraham Lincoln]]<ref name=Slashfilm>{{cite web |url=https://www.slashfilm.com/daniel-day-lewis-lincoln-steven-spielberg |title=Daniel Day-Lewis to Star in Steven Spielberg's ''Lincoln''|author=Fischer, Russ |date=November 19, 2010 |work=[[/Film]] |access-date=June 28, 2011}}</ref>\n* [[Sally Field]] as [[First Lady of the United States|First Lady]] [[Mary Todd Lincoln]]<ref>{{cite web |url=https://collider.com/sally-field-lincoln/85875 |title=Sally Field Set to Play Mary Todd Lincoln in Steven Spielberg's LINCOLN |author=Chitwood, Adam |date=April 13, 2011 |work=Collider.com |access-date=June 28, 2011}}</ref>\n* [[Gloria Reuben]]<ref name=screenrant>{{cite web | url=https://screenrant.com/steven-spielberg-lincoln-cast-sandy-114090/ | title=Spielberg's ''Lincoln'' Casts Every Other Good Actor Under The Sun | website=[[Screen Rant]] | date=May 6, 2011 | access-date=November 25, 2011}}</ref> as [[Elizabeth Keckley]], a former slave who was [[dressmaker]] and [[confidant]]e to Mary Todd Lincoln\n* [[Joseph Gordon-Levitt]] as [[Robert Todd Lincoln]]<ref name=\"Jones&Gordon-Levitt\">{{cite web|url=http://themoviemash.com/2011/05/tommy-lee-jones-joseph-gordon-levitt-join-spielbergs-lincoln|title=Tommy Lee Jones & Joseph Gordon-Levitt Join Spielberg's ''Lincoln''|author=Goetz, Barrett |date=May 5, 2011 |work=TheMovieMash.com |access-date=June 28, 2011}}</ref>\n* [[Gulliver McGrath]] as [[Tad Lincoln]]<ref name=EW>{{cite magazine | last = Labrecque | first = Jeff | title = 'Lincoln': Meet the Cast |magazine=Entertainment Weekly | date = November 28, 2011 | url = https://www.ew.com/ew/gallery/0,,20483133_20548946,00.html | access-date =December 1, 2011}}</ref>\n* [[Stephen McKinley Henderson]] as Lincoln's valet [[William Slade (valet)|William Slade]]<ref name=Mania/>\n* [[Elizabeth Marvel]] as Mrs. Jolly<ref name=Mania/>\n* [[Bill Camp]] as Mr. Jolly\n\n'''Union Army'''\n* [[Adam Driver]] as [[Samuel Beckwith]], Lincoln's telegraph operator, historically Grant's operator<ref name=Mania/>\n* [[Jared Harris]] as [[Lieutenant General (United States)|Lieutenant General]] [[Ulysses S.
