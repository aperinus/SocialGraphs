It was directed by [[Wayne Wang]] and stars [[Tsai Chin (actress)|Tsai Chin]], [[Kieu Chinh]], [[Lisa Lu]], [[France Nuyen]], [[Rosalind Chao]], [[Lauren Tom]], [[Tamlyn Tomita]], and [[Ming-Na Wen]]. The film is based on the 1989 [[The Joy Luck Club (novel)|novel of the same name]] by [[Amy Tan]],<ref>{{cite book|title=The Joy Luck Club|first=Amy|last=Tan|author-link= Amy Tan|publisher=[[G. P.

The film was produced by Bass, Tan, Wang and [[Patrick Markey]] while [[Oliver Stone]] served as an executive producer.<ref name=\"Club\">{{cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/79925/The-Joy-Luck-Club/full-credits.html|title=The Joy Luck Club|work=[[Turner Classic Movies]]|publisher=[[Turner Broadcasting System]]|location=United States|access-date=26 May 2018}}</ref> Four older women, all Chinese immigrants living in [[San Francisco]], meet regularly to play [[mahjong]], eat, and tell stories. Each of these women has an adult Chinese-American daughter. The film reveals the hidden pasts of the older women and their daughters and how their lives are shaped by the clash of Chinese and American cultures as they strive to understand their family bonds and one another.\n\nDevelopment of the project began when Wang approached Tan in 1989 at the time of the novel's release. Concerned about the novel's complex storytelling and character development, they teamed up with Bass in January 1990, who added a farewell party not in the original novel and [[voice-over]]s to compress the film's storytelling without changing the main plot. [[Carolco Pictures]] initially supported the project until 1990, when the filmmakers turned down the contract for not receiving the creative control that they demanded. After the first draft was written between August and November 1991, the filmmakers shifted to [[Hollywood Pictures]] in spring 1992. [[Principal photography]] took place in San Francisco, the novel and the film's main setting, in October 1992 and then in [[China]] in February 1993; filming ended in March 1993.\n\nThe film was privately screened in sneak previews in spring 1993 and film festivals in August and September 1993. It premiered in [[Los Angeles]], [[New York City]], and San Francisco on September 8, 1993. With the film's $10.5 million budget, it was moderately successful in the box office, earning $32.9&nbsp;million in the United States. It received positive critical reaction, but also criticism for its negative portrayal of Asian American and Asian male characters.<ref name=\"HarvardCrimson-Soong\"/><ref name=\"slate-joyluckclub\">{{cite web |url=https://slate.com/culture/2018/08/the-joy-luck-club-needs-to-be-forgiven-by-asian-americans.html |title=It's Time to Forgive The Joy Luck Club |last=Kang |first=Inkoo |publisher=Slate |date=August 17, 2018 |access-date=August 23, 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"HyphenMagazine\">{{cite web |url=https://hyphenmagazine.com/blog/2014/4/24/20th-anniversary-joy-luck-club |title=On The 20th Anniversary Of 'The Joy Luck Club' |last=Cho |first=Noah |publisher=HyphenMagazine |date=April 24, 2014 |access-date=August 23, 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn 2020, the film was selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Do not add details that were neither mentioned nor used in the film adaptation, even from the original novel. -->\n{{Further|The Joy Luck Club (novel)#Plot|The Joy Luck Club (novel)#Characters}}\n{{hatnote|The film presents the stories in different narratives. The following are mostly linear versions of the story sagas.}}\n\nThe Joy Luck Club was formed by four women in [[San Francisco]]: Lindo Jong, Ying-Ying St. Clair, An-Mei Hsu, and Suyuan Woo. The members have mainly played [[mahjong]] and told each other stories over the years. They emigrated from China, their native country, remarried, and gave birth to [[Chinese American|children in America]]. Suyuan's daughter June replaced her when Suyuan died four months before the time the film is set. The mothers have high hopes for their daughters' successes, but the daughters struggle through \"anxieties, feelings of inadequacy, and failures.\" Throughout the film, the mothers and daughters bond by learning to understand each other and by overcoming their conflicts.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gVbRZdvw9ZUC&pg=PA51|title=Multicultural films: a reference guide|pages=50\u201351|authors=Janice R. Welsch, J. Q. Adams|year=2005|publisher=Greenwood Press|isbn=9780313319754}}</ref>\n\n===Prologue===\nIn the prologue tale, narrated by June, a woman bought a swan in China from a market vendor who was selling it as \"a duck that stretched its neck [to become] a goose.\" She kept it as her pet and brought it to the United States. When the immigration officials took it away from her, she struggled to grab the swan away but was only able to retrieve one feather. For a long time, the woman had kept the feather, planning to give it to her daughter someday.\n\nThen the film [[film transition|transitions]] to June's farewell surprise party in San Francisco for her upcoming reunion with her long-lost twin sisters in China. Among the guests are members of The Joy Luck Club, their daughters, other relatives, and friends. The following characters below narrate their journeys to the audience while they reflect upon their pasts.\n\n===Lindo and Waverly Jong===\nIn China, four-year-old Lindo was arranged by her mother and the matchmaker to be married to Mrs. Huang's son when she grows up. When Lindo turns 15, her peasant family transfers Lindo to the wealthy Huangs in order for her to marry Huang's son, Tyan Hu, a prepubescent boy who has no interest in her. She spent four years in the childless and loveless marriage, enduring Mrs. Huang's abuse for not producing her a grandson.\n\nOnce, Lindo eavesdrops on the servant girl Ping telling her lover that she is pregnant, prompting him to abandon her. Plotting to leave the marriage without dishonoring herself, her family, and her in-laws, Lindo claims having a nightmare in which Tyan Hu's ancestor threatened to punish her, Tyan Hu, and the matchmaker. Lindo further claims the ancestor impregnating Ping with Tyan Hu's child, which Mrs. Huang verifies through inspection, and being offended by the marriage. Then Lindo further claims the matchmaker intentionally and wrongly pairing Lindo and Tyan Hu for money. Furious, Mrs. Huang orders the matchmakers out of the Huangs' lives, allows Ping to marry Tyan Hu, and eventually gets the grandson she has desired. Lindo finally leaves the house and then moves to [[Shanghai]].\n\nYears later in America, Lindo has a new husband, a son,<!-- only one son is shown in the film; two sons are mentioned in the novel --> and a daughter named Waverly. Aged between six and nine, Waverly has become a [[chess]] champion. Annoyed by Lindo using her to \"show off\" to people on the streets, Waverly decides to quit chess. When she tries to play it again, Waverly has lost her confidence, prompting her to retire from chess.\n\nWaverly, now an adult, has a daughter Shoshana from her Chinese ex-husband<!-- still unnamed in film; do not use the character's name from novel --> and is going to [[Interracial marriage in the United States#Asian and White|marry a White man]], Rich, much to Lindo's chagrin. In order to make Lindo like Rich, Waverly brings him to a family dinner, but he improperly uses chopsticks and inadvertently insults Lindo's cooking, humiliating Waverly.\n\nSome time later, Lindo and the reluctant Waverly go to a hair salon to get their hair done for Waverly's upcoming wedding. After Lindo's shampooing, when Waverly directs the stylist on how Lindo's hair needed to be done, Lindo is offended that her daughter would be embarrassed by her and becomes reluctant to attend the wedding. When Waverly becomes devastated, Lindo then tells her about one of her moments with her own mother. When Waverly asked whether Lindo likes Rich, Lindo admits that she likes Rich very much as her son-in-law and then gives Waverly and Rich her blessings, leading her and Waverly to reconcile. Back at June's farewell party, Rich almost successfully uses chopsticks (but accidentally drops a piece) and impresses Lindo by trying to respect [[Customs and etiquette in Chinese dining|Chinese table manners]].\n\n===Ying-Ying and Lena St. Clair===\nIn China, Ying-Ying St. Clair was married to Lin-Xiao with a baby boy. Then Lin-Xiao is revealed to be a very abusive man and begins to have multiple affairs while completely disassociating himself from her. Overwhelmed by her depression, Ying-Ying begins to dissociate and accidentally drowns their baby son in the bathtub during one of these episodes, which haunts her afterwards. Years later, she has emigrated to America and suffers from bouts of depression from the trauma as well as worrying her daughter Lena will suffer as well.\n\nAfter Ying-Ying finally resolved her years of trauma, Lena shows Ying-Ying around her new apartment with her husband Harold, who is also Lena's boss. Ying-Ying learns that Lena is uncomfortable with her financial arrangements with Harold. They split the costs of their life evenly with a list of things that they share, making their home life contentious. However, Harold predominates the arrangements and forgoes most of Lena's needs.\n\nSeeing that Lena is unhappy with her marriage, Ying-Ying reasserts herself by knocking over a table in the bedroom and causing a vase to fall from the table and break. Hearing the sudden noise, Lena goes to her mother and admits her unhappiness. Ying-Ying tells Lena she should leave and not come back until Harold gives her what she wants. Shifting to June's farewell party, Lena is seen with her new vibrant fianc\u00e9 Ken, who has given Lena what she wants and is accepting of Ying-Ying as she is of him.\n\n===An-Mei and Rose Hsu===\nNine-year-old An-Mei Hsu has been raised by her relatives and grandmother. She is reunited with her long-lost mother, who was disowned by her family for her \"[[affair|dalliance]]\" with a wealthy middle-aged man named Wu-Tsing, who has three other wives, making An-Mei's mother [[Concubinage|the Fourth Wife]] shortly after her husband's death. An Mei's mother also arrives to see her dying mother. In order to not lose her again, An-Mei moves out with her mother to Wu-Tsing's house against her relatives' wishes for her to remain with them.\n\nYears later in America, we learn about An-Mei's daughter Rose who met her husband, Ted Jordan, in college. Ted is initially attracted to Rose's assertive, forthright nature. She agrees to marry him when he confronts his aristocratic mother for making racist comments towards her. Over the course of their marriage, however, Rose and Ted become distant from each other, mainly because Rose, desperate to prove herself to Ted's milieu, becomes submissive and demure at the cost of her own identity and interests. They have a daughter, Jennifer, but this doesn't resolve their marital problems. To complicate matters more, Rose suspects that Ted has cheated on her with another woman, which he asserts is not the main reason for their problems.\n\nSome time later, An-Mei comes for a visit and relays the story of her own mother's fate to Rose. When An-Mei arrives at Wu-Tsing's house, the Second Wife gives An-Mei a \"pearl\" necklace as a gift to win her over. Moments later, An-Mei's mother destroys the necklace, which turns out to be made of glass. Later, An-Mei learns the truth of how her mother became a Fourth Wife: While her mother was at the temple mourning the death of her husband, the Second Wife met and befriended her, enticing her to meet Wu-Tsing who raped and impregnated her. The mother's relatives refused to believe she had been raped and kicked her out of the house. With nowhere else to go, the mother reluctantly agreed to become Wu-Tsing's Fourth Wife. After the mother gave birth to a boy, An-Mei's half-brother, the Second Wife took him, claiming him as her own. After telling An-Mei the truth about her situation, the mother commits suicide by eating \"sticky sweet dumplings\" laced with opium, choosing the day of her death carefully to threaten Wu-Tsing with the vengeance of her angry ghost. Afraid of this curse, Wu-Tsing vows to honor An-Mei's mother as an honorable First Wife and promises to raise An-Mei and her half-brother accordingly. When Second Wife tries to pay respects to An-Mei's late mother, An-Mei screams at the Second Wife, destroys her faux pearl necklace. As An-Mei narrates, the Second Wife's hair starts turning white after that day.\n\nBack to Rose's story setting, An-Mei encourages Rose to stand up to Ted for herself and for Jennifer, or nothing will change. To avoid the fate of An-Mei's mother, Rose reclaims her strength and confronts Ted face to face, telling him that he will leave the house and that he will not take their daughter away from her. Rose then confides in him that she was wrong to consider her love for him as less worthy than his love for her, compelling Ted to take her seriously and stop taking her for granted. At June's farewell party, Rose and Ted are seen briefly kissing and sharing a slice of cake, although their current marital status is not revealed onscreen.\n\n===Suyuan and June Woo===\nWhen [[Operation Ichi-Go|the Japanese invaded China]] during [[World War II]], Suyuan Woo escaped the invasion with her twin baby daughters. When Suyuan became ill during her quest for refuge, her cart breaks down, causing the babies to fall. Near death, Suyuan was unable to carry the babies herself and abandoned them along with all of her other possessions, including a photo of herself. Suyuan survived but was haunted by guilt over the loss of her daughters and not knowing their fates.\n\nAfter remarrying in America, Suyuan has high hopes for her new daughter June, but June constantly fails to meet Suyuan's expectations out of June's lack of interest. She performs badly during a piano recital at age nine. Suyuan pushes June to continue June's piano training, but June refuses.\n\nThe story moves ahead to one year before Suyuan's passing. June, now an adult, has been freelancing for her long-time rival Waverly. In a dinner party, Waverly rejects June's business proposals, prompting Suyuan to comment that June and Waverly are not alike in that ''style'' is something one cannot be taught but must be born with. June understands her mother to say that Waverly has ''style'' while June does not and feels humiliated, believing that her mother has betrayed her being a failure in her mother's eyes.\n\nThe following day, June berates Suyuan for her remarks and admits she could never live up to her high expectations. June laments that Suyuan has always been disappointed in June because of her disappointing academic grades, her lack of a serious relationship, and her less-than-successful job. Then Suyuan gives her the necklace that Suyuan has worn since June's birth, which Suyuan asserts can help guide June's heart as it has done hers. Suyuan also assures June that she is the one who has the unteachable ''style'', admitting that while Waverly has been the better of the two in competitions, June always has had the best heart, which is the reason Suyuan is so proud to have June as her daughter. Since that day, June has worn the necklace her mother gave her.\n\nOn [[Easter]], before her farewell party, June receives the news from the Club that the long-lost twins are alive. When June cannot understand the twins' letter written in Chinese, Lindo purportedly mistranslates the letter, claiming that the twins acknowledge Suyuan's death and their half-sister June. Back in the present, when the farewell party ends, Lindo confesses that she wrote letters to the twins and then signed Suyuan's name. June begs Lindo to tell them the truth, but Lindo tells her that it is too late because the twin sisters are anticipating their mother, still believing that Suyuan is alive. A short while later, June's father<!-- do not add his name from the novel --> retells the war story of Suyuan and her long-lost twin daughters. Then he gives her the swan feather (as described earlier in the prologue) from Suyuan's swan, saying that the feather looks worthless but carries with it all of her mother's \"good intentions.\" When she arrives in China to meet her sisters, June tells them the truth about Suyuan and herself. The sisters finally embrace.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Joy luck club movie cast.jpg|upright=1.1|thumb|''from left'': Suyuan ([[Kieu Chinh]]), June ([[Ming-Na Wen]]), Waverly ([[Tamlyn Tomita]]), Lindo ([[Tsai Chin (actress)|Tsai Chin]]), Ying-Ying ([[France Nuyen]]), Lena ([[Lauren Tom]]), An-Mei ([[Lisa Lu]]), and Rose ([[Rosalind Chao]])]]\n\n'''Mothers'''\n* [[Tsai Chin (actress)|Tsai Chin]] as Lindo Jong\n** Age 4: Ying Wu<!-- not to be confused with victim of similar name-->\n** Age 15: [[Irene Ng (actress)|Irene Ng]]\n* [[Kieu Chinh]] as Suyuan Woo\n* [[Lisa Lu]] as An-Mei Hsu\n** Age 4: Emmy Yu\n** Age 9: [[Yi Ding (actress)|Yi Ding]]\n* [[France Nuyen]] as Ying-Ying St. Clair\n** Age 16\u201325: [[Faye Yu]]\n\n'''Daughters'''\n* [[Rosalind Chao]] as Rose Hsu Jordan\n* [[Lauren Tom]] as Lena St. Clair\n* [[Tamlyn Tomita]] as Waverly Jong\n** Age 6\u20139: Mai Vu\n* [[Ming-Na Wen]] as June Woo\n** Age 9: Melanie Chang\n\n'''Other characters'''\n* [[Michael Paul Chan]] as Harold, Lena's Husband\n* [[Andrew McCarthy]] as Ted Jordan\n* [[Christopher Rich (American actor)|Christopher Rich]] as Rich\n* [[Russell Wong]] as Lin Xiao\n* [[Vivian Wu]] as An-Mei's Mother\n* [[Victor Wong (actor born 1927)|Victor Wong]] as Old Chong the Piano Teacher\n* [[Xi Meijuan]] as Lindo's Mother\n* Hsu Ying Li as the matchmaker\n* [[Diane Baker]] as Mrs. Jordan\n* [[Wu Tianming]] as Wu-Tsing\n* [[Elizabeth Sung]] as Second Wife\n* [[Chao-Li Chi]] as June's Father\n* [[Philip Moon (actor)|Philip Moon]] as Ken\n\n==Production==\n{{multiple image\n|image1=Lauren wiki.jpg|caption1=[[Lauren Tom]]|width1=149\n|alt1=Long-haired Asian-American woman smiling to a camera\n|image2=Ming-Na 4.jpg|caption2=[[Ming-Na Wen]]|width2=140\n|alt2=Asian-American woman in a red dress smiling to a camera\n|footer=Before ''The Joy Luck Club'', cast members Tom and Wen were relatively unknown to American audiences.\n}}\n[[Amy Tan]] and [[Academy Award for Best Writing (Original Screenplay)|Academy Award]] winner [[Ronald Bass]] wrote the film adaptation.

Stone and Wang reconciled their differences enabling them to work together and finally agreed to produce the film together<ref name=dutkapg1/> along with other producers.\n\n[[Carolco Pictures]] initially agreed to support the project in spring 1990, but the company had fiscal problems, and the filmmakers turned down the contract six months later in fall 1990 due to not receiving the level of creative control that they demanded.<ref name=dutkapg1/><ref name=amytan93p3/> Therefore, Tan, Wang, and Bass outlined the screenplay themselves \"in a narrative format\" over three days in January 1991.<ref name=amytan93p3/> Tan and Bass completed the first draft between August and November 1991.<ref name=amytan93p3/> When they returned to Ixtlan in March 1992,<ref name=dutkapg1/><ref name=amytan93p3/> [[Jeffrey Katzenberg]], chairman of [[The Walt Disney Studios (production company)|Walt Disney Studios]], approved the project as proposed by Stone and Yang, and gave them full creative control.<ref name=amytan93p3/><ref name=nytimespg2/> In spring 1992, the [[Hollywood Pictures]] agreed to assist production and distribute the film.<ref name=amytan93p3/><ref name=1993june27/>\n\nDespite that she lacked filmmaking experience, \"[Amy] Tan found the process not nearly as bad as she had feared.
