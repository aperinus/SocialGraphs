Ford and [[Edward James Olmos]] reprise their roles from the original film. Gosling plays K, a Nexus-9 [[replicant]] \"blade runner\" who uncovers a secret that threatens to destabilize society and the course of civilization.\n\nIdeas for a ''Blade Runner'' sequel were first proposed in the 1990s, but licensing issues stalled their development. [[Andrew Kosove]] and [[Broderick Johnson]] obtained the film rights from [[Bud Yorkin]]. [[Ridley Scott]] stepped down as the film's initial director and worked as an executive producer, while Villeneuve was later appointed to direct. ''Blade Runner 2049'' was financed through a partnership between [[Alcon Entertainment]] and [[Sony Pictures Releasing|Sony Pictures]], as well as a Hungarian government-funded tax rebate. [[Warner Bros. Pictures|Warner Bros.]], on behalf of Alcon, distributed the film in North America, while Sony handled distribution in international markets. [[Principal photography]] took place mostly at two soundstages in [[Budapest]] over four months from July to November 2016.\n\n''Blade Runner 2049'' premiered in Los Angeles on October 3, 2017, and was released in the United States in 2D, 3D, and [[IMAX]] on October 6, 2017. The film received acclaim from critics, who praised its performances, direction, cinematography, editing, musical score, production design, visual effects, and faithfulness to the original film, although its runtime was criticized. It was widely considered among the best films of 2017. However, it was a [[box office disappointment]], grossing $259.3{{nbsp}}million worldwide against a production budget between $150\u2013185{{nbsp}}million.<ref name=\"BOM\" /><ref name=\"Bomb/Film\" /><ref name=\"BombForbes\" /> ''Blade Runner 2049'' was nominated for and won several [[List of accolades received by Blade Runner 2049|accolades]]: at the [[90th Academy Awards]], the film won [[Academy Award for Best Cinematography|Best Cinematography]] and [[Academy Award for Best Visual Effects|Best Visual Effects]], and was nominated for [[Academy Award for Best Production Design|Best Production Design]], [[Academy Award for Best Sound Editing|Best Sound Editing]], and [[Academy Award for Best Sound Mixing|Best Sound Mixing]]. It also received eight nominations at the [[71st British Academy Film Awards]], including [[BAFTA Award for Best Direction|Best Director]], and won [[BAFTA Award for Best Cinematography|Best Cinematography]] and [[BAFTA Award for Best Special Visual Effects|Best Special Visual]].

[[List of Blade Runner characters#K|K]] (short for his serial number, KD6-3.7), a Nexus-9 replicant, works for the [[Los Angeles Police Department]] (LAPD) as a \"blade runner\", an officer who hunts and \"retires\" (kills) rogue replicants. He retires Nexus-8 replicant [[List of Blade Runner characters#Sapper Morton|Sapper Morton]] and finds a box buried under a tree at Morton's protein farm. The box contains the remains of a female replicant who died during a [[caesarean section]], demonstrating that replicants can reproduce biologically, previously thought impossible. K's superior, [[List of Blade Runner characters#Lt. Joshi|Lt. Joshi]], fears that this could lead to a war between humans and replicants. She orders K to find and retire the replicant child to hide the truth.\n\nK visits the headquarters of the Wallace Corporation, the successor to the defunct Tyrell Corporation in the manufacture of replicants. Wallace staff members identify the deceased female from DNA archives as [[List of Blade Runner characters#Rachael|Rachael]], an experimental replicant designed by [[List of Blade Runner characters#Dr. Eldon Tyrell|Dr. Eldon Tyrell]]. K learns of Rachael's romantic ties with former blade runner [[Rick Deckard]]. Wallace Corporation CEO [[List of Blade Runner characters#Niander Wallace|Niander Wallace]] wants to discover the secret to replicant reproduction to expand [[Space colonization|interstellar colonization]]. He sends his replicant enforcer [[List of Blade Runner characters#Luv|Luv]] to steal Rachael's remains and follow K to Rachael's child.\n\nAt Morton's farm, K finds 6.10.21 carved into the tree trunk and recognizes it from a childhood memory of a wooden toy horse. Because replicant memories are artificial, K's [[Hologram|holographic]] [[A.I.]] girlfriend [[List of Blade Runner characters#Joi|Joi]] believes this is evidence that K was born, not created. He searches LAPD records and discovers twins born on that date with identical DNA aside from the [[Allosome|sex chromosome]], but only the boy is listed as alive. K tracks the child to an orphanage in ruined [[San Diego]] but discovers the records from that year to be missing. K recognizes the orphanage from his memories and finds the toy horse where he remembers hiding it.\n\n[[List of Blade Runner characters#Ana Stelline|Dr. Ana Stelline]], a replicant memory designer, confirms that the memory of the orphanage is real, leading K to conclude that he is Rachael's son. At LAPD headquarters, K fails a post-traumatic baseline test, marking him as a rogue replicant; he lies to Joshi by implying he killed the replicant child. Joshi gives K 48 hours to pass the baseline test or he will be 'retired.' Joi hires Mariette, a prostitute replicant, as a surrogate for Joi to have sex with K. Mariette, who is part of the replicant freedom movement, leaves a tracker on K. At Joi's request, K reluctantly transfers her to a mobile emitter so he cannot be tracked through her console memory-files. He has the toy horse analyzed, revealing traces of radiation that lead him to the ruins of [[Las Vegas]]. He finds Deckard, who tells him that he is the father of Rachael's child and scrambled the birth records to protect the child's identity; Deckard left the child in the custody of the replicant freedom movement.\n\nLuv kills Joshi and tracks K to Las Vegas. She kidnaps Deckard, destroys Joi, and leaves K to die. Using Mariette's tracker, the replicant freedom movement rescues K. When their leader, [[List of Blade Runner characters#Freysa Sadeghpour|Freysa]], tells him that she helped deliver Rachael's child and that the child was a girl, K understands that he is not Rachael's child, deduces that Stelline is her daughter and that the memory of the toy horse is hers, one she implanted amongst those of other replicants whose memories she designed. To prevent Deckard from leading Wallace to Stelline or the freedom movement, Freysa asks K to kill Deckard for all replicants' greater good.\n\nLuv takes Deckard to Wallace Corporation headquarters to meet Wallace. Wallace offers Deckard a clone of Rachael in exchange for revealing what he knows. Deckard refuses, and Luv kills the clone. As Luv transports Deckard to be tortured and interrogated off-world, K intercepts Luv's shuttle and tries to rescue Deckard. He fights Luv and ultimately drowns her, but he is badly wounded. He stages Deckard's death to protect him from Wallace and the replicant freedom movement before taking Deckard to Stelline's office and handing him her toy horse. As K lies on the steps, looking up at snow falling from the sky, Deckard enters the building and meets his daughter for the first time.{{efn|In an interview with ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'', ''Blade Runner 2049'' screenwriter Michael Green confirmed that K dies as he lies on the steps.<ref name=\"GreenEW\" />}}\n\n== Cast ==\n{{See also|List of Blade Runner characters}}\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Ryan Gosling]] as K / Joe\n* [[Harrison Ford]] as [[Rick Deckard]]\n* [[Ana de Armas]] as Joi\n* [[Sylvia Hoeks]] as Luv\n* [[Robin Wright]] as Lt.

The terms of Alcon's acquisition prohibited the remake of the original ''Blade Runner'' film, but entitled the company rights to syndication, franchising, and derivative media such as prequels and sequels.<ref name=\"Rebootio9\" /> No longer satisfied with the profits of their smaller-budget features, and with investor funding scarce, Kosove and Johnson sought to increase Alcon's output of [[blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbuster]] films: \"If you don't have repetitive cash flow, which is a fancy way of saying being in the sequel business, you are going to be in trouble eventually.\"<ref name=\"AlconTHR\" /> Progress on a new ''Blade Runner'' feature soon intensified when Kosove named [[Christopher Nolan]] one of his ideal choices to direct.<ref name=\"Kosoveio9\" /> However, Nolan said he never planned to direct, despite being an admirer of the [[Blade Runner (franchise)|''Blade Runner'' franchise]].<ref name=\"NolanLATimes\" />\n\nBy August 2011, Alcon announced Ridley Scott's signing as the film's director to the press.<ref name=\"AlconDeadline\" /> The British filmmaker had long desired a sequel to expand upon the subject matter.<ref name=\"NYTimesDiscussion\" /> After securing Scott's services, the studio assigned [[Michael Green (writer)|Michael Green]] and a returning [[Hampton Fancher]] the responsibility for writing the script.<ref name=\"GreenDeadline\" /><ref name=\"FancherDeadline\" /> Alcon producers provided some insight of their vision but were unsure of how to approach the ''Blade Runner'' story,<ref name=\"ScottBBC\" /><ref name=\"ScottVariety\" /> hence they and the normally candid Scott were tight-lipped when questioned further about the sequel's artistic direction in interviews conducted during the pre-production.<ref name=\"ScottWSJ\" /><ref name=\"FordIGN\" /><ref name=\"ScottMTV\" /> Ultimately, Scott resigned from his duties once his existing commitment to ''[[Alien: Covenant]]'' (2017) took precedence, and retained partial oversight as an executive producer.<ref name=\"NYTimesDiscussion\" /><ref name=\"ScottResignVerge\" /> He also made significant contributions to the screenplay, albeit in an uncredited role.<ref name=\"ScottVulture\" />\n\n''Blade Runner 2049'' was Alcon's second collaboration with director [[Denis Villeneuve]], who they called for a meeting at a cafe in rural New Mexico to negotiate an offer. They had an existing professional relationship from ''[[Prisoners (2013 film)|Prisoners]]'' (2013).<ref name=\"VilleneuveDeadline\" /> Villeneuve credits ''Blade Runner'' for inspiring his passion for filmmaking,<ref name=\"NYTimesDiscussion\" /> but hesitated to accept the assignment at first as he feared tarnishing the franchise's legacy.<ref name=\"VilleneuveDeadline\" /> Nevertheless, he liked the screenplay and was assured by Fancher's investment in the project.<ref name=\"VilleneuveDeadline\" /><ref name=\"ConceptArtEW\" /> Villeneuve preserved elements of the original film by modernizing ''Blade Runner''{{'s}} [[retrofuturism|retrofuturistic]] onscreen world, which he saw as imperative for an authentic story.<ref name=\"NYTimesDiscussion\" />\n\nA scene from [[Steven Spielberg]]{{'s}} ''[[Ready Player One (film)|Ready Player One]]'' (2018) set in the ''Blade Runner'' universe was excluded from the film's finished cut.

It really makes you question your idea of the hero and the villain, the idea of what it means to be human.\"<ref name=\"NYTimesDiscussion\" /> ''Blade Runner 2049'' proved challenging for Gosling because of the production's scope.<ref name=\"GoslingEQ\" />\n\n[[Ana de Armas]] auditioned several times before landing the film's female lead. De Armas was an actress of national renown in Spain, aspiring to break into English-speaking roles.<ref name=\"deArmasW\" /> After working in her first Hollywood film in ''[[Hands of Stone]]'' (2016), she settled in Los Angeles in pursuit of a role that did not [[Typecasting|typecast]] her ethnicity. De Armas underwent four months of rigorous speech training to master her English before auditioning. Once the studio commenced production of ''Blade Runner 2049'', the actress said her fitness training provided the necessary mental space to prepare for the intense shooting schedule.<ref name=\"deArmasW\" />\n\nVilleneuve considered [[David Bowie]], one of the franchise's core influences, for the part of Niander Wallace, but the musician died before filming began.<ref name=\"BowieIW\" /> Instead, he and the producers looked at [[Jared Leto]], fresh off the filming of ''[[Suicide Squad (film)|Suicide Squad]]'' (2016) because they felt he exuded Bowie's rockstar sensibility.<ref name=\"BowieIW\" /><ref name=\"LetoVariety\" /> Leto refrains from naming specific sources that shaped certain aspects of his character's persona, rather the actor cites real-life friends that work in [[information technology|tech]] as a general influence.<ref name=\"LetoVox\" /> Leto is notorious in the film industry for his unorthodox preparation for his roles, and he continued his unusual practices in ''Blade Runner 2049'' by wearing custom opaque contact lenses to work the set completely blind.<ref name=\"LetoIW\" /> Villeneuve recalled his first day shooting with the actor, \"He entered the room, and he could not see at all. He was walking with an assistant very slowly. It was like seeing Jesus walking into a temple. Everybody became super silent, and there was a kind of sacred moment. Everyone was in awe.

(One in five women is now childless by the age of 45; the rates are higher among women who have been to university.) Feminism is one potential solution to this problem: removing the barriers which make women feel that motherhood is a closing of doors.

The normalization of women\u2019s roles as things to be consumed, there\u2019s products that are made, just like there are now, the idea of the semi-sentient sex doll is really in line with what\u2019s going on in this Blade Runner universe, about having a thing that fulfills everything you want, but doesn\u2019t talk back and can\u2019t argue with you, but can be a loving, supporting companion and also fulfill all your sexual needs feels like something that\u2019s very contemporary and something the movie is very self-aware about. And then I think that there are female roles in different castes of this society that are able to be more embodied and powerful in conventional ways, and also have cracks in their facade where you see their vulnerabilities. But it seems like this world is so dependent on this caste system of humans perform these roles; replicants perform these roles, human superiors, creators, and those are the ways that women sort of travel between.
