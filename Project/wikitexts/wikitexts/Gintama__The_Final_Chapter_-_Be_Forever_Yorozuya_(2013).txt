It was directed by the director from the anime series [[Yoichi Fujita]] and based on a story by [[Hideaki Sorachi]], ''Gin Tama''{{'}}s original author.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2012-12-22/gintama-2nd-film-slated-for-next-summer|title=Gintama's 2nd Film Slated for Next Summer |publisher=[[Anime News Network]] |date=December 22, 2012 |access-date=March 13, 2013}}</ref> It stars [[Tomokazu Sugita]], [[Daisuke Sakaguchi]], [[Rie Kugimiya]] among others. The film focuses on the freelancer samurai [[Gintoki Sakata]] in a [[time travel]]ling story where he encounters older personas of the people he met in Edo.\n\n''The Final Chapter'' was first announced August 2012 although major details were not released until early 2013. Although the film has been marketed as \"Final Chapter\" Sorachi and Fujita did not confirm it was the last anime production from ''Gin Tama''; the former wrote the story with the concept of the series' ending. Two themes were provided by the bands [[SPYAIR]] and [[Tommy heavenly6]], with latter's song having already been used in the television series.\n\n==Plot==\nWhile working in a cinema, Gintoki comes upon a \"movie thief\" (a figure in Japanese culture often depicted as a man with a video camera as a head, stand in as someone who illegally film in cinemas). After scolding the movie thief for his actions, he finds himself warped into another world via the camera lens. In this world, 5 years have passed, and not only has the land of Edo changed into an apocalyptic wasteland, but it is stated Gintoki has died. The movie thief, or Time Thief the time machine, explains mankind is close to extinction, and gives Gintoki an item to disguise himself. After the Time Thief is damaged by criminals, Gintoki encounters his freelancer comrades:  [[List of Gin Tama characters#Shinpachi Shimura|Shinpachi Shimura]], who has turned into a cool samurai with no trace of tsukkomi, and [[List of Gin Tama characters#Kagura|Kagura]], who has changed into a beautiful woman with no Chinese speech pattern. The future's Gintoki is assumed to have died as a result of the \"White Curse.\" Kagura and Shinpachi have been trying to deal with their leader's disappearance and Gintoki, disguised thanks to the Time Thief, tries to help them overcome their sadness.\n\nGintoki, Kagura and Shinpachi go to the execution of the Shinsengumi leader [[List of Gin Tama characters#Kagura|Isao Kondo]], Joi terrorist [[List of Gin Tama characters#Kotaro Katsura|Kotaro Katsura]] and mechanic [[List of Gin Tama characters#Gengai Hiraga|Gengai Hiraga]]. Kondo and Katsura are saved by their underlings [[List of Gin Tama characters#Sougo Okita|Sogo Okita]], [[List of Gin Tama characters#Toshiro Hijikata|Toshiro Hijikata]] and [[List of Gin Tama characters#Elizabeth|Elizabeth]] who have joined forces to form a new group opposing the bakufu while Gengai is revealed to be an imposter. Interacting with the new group Gintoki learns the White Curse was started by a group of sorcerers known as {{nihongo|Enmi|\u53ad\u9b45}} who Gintoki's Joi faction fought in a previous war. Gintoki was infected with a virus which had undergone an incubation period and the future's Gintoki disappeared while fighting it. One victim of the White Curse is Shinpachi's sister, [[List of Gin Tama characters#Tae Shimura|Tae]], who is close to her death. In order to cure her, Gintoki's friends go to search for the Emmi. Gintoki finds and kills the Emmi who is revealed to be the future's Gintoki who set this series of events off to be killed by his past self.\n\nDespite the death of the future Gintoki, the White Curse does not stop. Gintoki used the repaired Time Thief to go back to the past and kill his past self from the war, the White Demon, before the virus goes into incubation. However, the White Demon is actually [[List of Gin Tama characters#Taizo Hasegawa|Taizo Hasegawa]] in disguise. It is revealed that Tama is the Time Thief who was used by the people from the future to stop Gintoki from erasing his existence and help him defeat the Emmi before the curse starts. Together with his friends and the last generation of the old Jouishi (Katsura, Takasugi, Sakamoto, and the white demon otherwise known as the Gintoki from the past) fight against the Emmi. Finally, Gintoki and the white demon defeat the Emmi, stopping them from starting the curse. Gintoki reunites with the Yorozuya and then him and his friends return to their own timeline, all promising to meet again. The ending scene consists of the original members of the J\u014di watching from a cliff. At the end of the story, after the credits end, it shows that Gintoki, Shinpachi, and Kagura meeting together even after the past is changed.\n\n==Cast==\n{{multiple image\n | footer    = Daisuke Sakaguchi (left) and Rie Kugimiya expressed difficulties with their alternative incarnations of Shinpachi and Kagura, respectively.\n | image1    = FanimeCon 2016 (Daisuke Sakaguchi).jpg\n | alt1      = Daisuke Sakaguchi\n | caption1  =  \n | width1    = 180\n | image2    = 26th Tokyo International Film Festival Kugimiya Rie from DOKIDOKI PRETTY CURE!

SPYAIR read the script of the movie and later had a talk with Fujita in order to get an idea for \"Genj\u014d Destruction.\" They learned the theme was going to be used in a fight scene and thus worked to compose a high quality song in order to make it match with the movie.<ref name=\"okwave\">{{cite web|url=http://okstars.okwave.jp/vol279.html|title=Vol.279 \u30ed\u30c3\u30af\u30d0\u30f3\u30c9 SPYAIR|publisher=OKWave|access-date=August 19, 2013|archive-date=July 9, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150709103607/http://okstars.okwave.jp/vol279.html|url-status=dead}}</ref> A twenty-three theme CD soundtrack was released on July 3, 2013 by [[Aniplex]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/B00CHQZ9LA/|title=\u5287\u5834\u7248\u9280\u9b42 \u5b8c\u7d50\u7bc7 \u4e07\u4e8b\u5c4b\u3088\u6c38\u9060\u306a\u308c \u30aa\u30ea\u30b8\u30ca\u30eb\u30fb\u30b5\u30a6\u30f3\u30c9\u30c8\u30e9\u30c3\u30af Soundtrack|access-date=August 5, 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Changes===\nThe Anime Book for the 2nd Gintama movie had a bonus part where it showed off the storyboards of the original version of movie 2 where there were 3 additional scenes that were cut from the final version.

A conversation with Gintoki and Gengai after Gintoki met his future self, and the most important one, a cut scene that would have explained how the memories of Gintoki came back to the others, with Tama, having saved pictures of Gintoki and using it to show everyone around giving them back the memories of Gintoki. Additionally, there were two further changes made, a different version of the opening and a different version of how Gintoki and Future Gintoki talk would have gone down.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://bookwalker.jp/de013cea51-8661-44b0-84ee-33a8a12253ce/|title = \u9280\u9b42 \u30a2\u30cb\u30e1\u30b3\u30df\u30c3\u30af\u30b9 \u5287\u5834\u7248\u9280\u9b42 \u5b8c\u7d50\u7bc7 \u4e07\u4e8b\u5c4b\u3088\u6c38\u9060\u306a\u308c \u7a7a\u77e5\u82f1\u79cb\u30cd\u30fc\u30e0\u672c\uff06\u305d\u3053\u304b\u3089\u8d77\u3053\u3057\u305f\u30a2\u30cb\u30e1\u30b3\u30df\u30c3\u30af\u30b9}}</ref>\n\n==Release==\nIn December 2012 at [[Jump Festa]] the cast from the ''Gintama'' anime series commented they were not sure when the film was going to be released due to delays from the script.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2012-12-22/gintama-2nd-film-slated-for-next-summer|title=Gintama's 2nd Film Slated for Next Summer|publisher=[[Anime News Network]] |date=December 22, 2012 |access-date=August 5, 2013}}</ref> The delay to Summer 2013 was confirmed in January 2013 in an episode from the TV series.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.crunchyroll.com/anime-news/2013/01/10-1/gintama-anime-confirms-movie-delay|title=\"Gintama\" Anime Confirms Movie Delay |publisher=[[Crunchyroll]] |date=January 10, 2013 |access-date=August 5, 2013}}</ref> An anime event titled \"Soul of Silver\" was made to promote the movie in Osaka.
