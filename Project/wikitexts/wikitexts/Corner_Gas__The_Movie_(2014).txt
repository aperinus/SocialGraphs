The film stars [[Brent Butt]], [[Gabrielle Miller]], [[Fred Ewanuick]], [[Eric Peterson]], [[Janet Wright]], [[Lorne Cardinal]], [[Tara Spencer-Nairn]], [[Nancy Robertson (actress)|Nancy Robertson]], Cavan Cunningham, Gwen Seed and Jean Freeman all reprising their roles from the television series. The film also features new characters played by [[Don Lake]], [[Reagan Pasternak]], [[Graham Greene (actor)|Graham Greene]], [[Will Sasso]] and Karen Holness.    The original series aired on  [[CTV Television Network|CTV]] from 2004 to 2009.\n\nThe film gained a limited release, and was later released on [[DVD]] and [[Blu-ray]]. Fans of the television series reacted positively to the film, which led it to gain a [[cult following]].\n\nThis is Janet Wright's final Performance before her death in 2016.\n\n==Plot==\nThe film opens with perpetually unemployed Hank Yarbo dreaming about an armed robbery at Corner Gas, in which station owner Brent Leroy and retail clerk Wanda Dollard turn out to be robots, while the robber changes into a werewolf whom Wanda fights. Hank wakes up with a ''National Star'' judge in front of him at the [[Regina International Airport|Regina Airport]]. They depart for Dog River, where the town is in a riot. Hank proceeds to explain the events that caused the town to fall apart.\n\nFive years after the original series finale, Mayor Fitzy has blown the town's money on a bad real estate investment in [[Detroit]], leaving the town without electricity or water. A box that Sergeant Davis Quinton checked on his contract allows the town to force him to retire on his 25th anniversary of police service. He leaves Wanda to watch his house which, with its two diesel-powered backup generators, is the only place in Dog River with reliable electrical power. Wanda turns Davis' garage into an illegal bar and later a casino. Officer Karen Pelly, married and pregnant, begins issuing tickets in order to improve her stats and her job prospects should Dog River close and thus require her to find a job in another community's police department. Brent's father Oscar becomes a [[survivalism|survivalist]] and trades his car for a horse-drawn cart, which is confiscated by Karen and repeatedly stolen back. An epiphany leads Davis to become a private detective and begin solving anything that he can determine to be a \"mystery\".\n\nAfter realizing that the crisis won't blow over and Lacey Burrows, the owner of local diner The Ruby, will move away if Dog River goes bankrupt, Brent buys the closed town bar and enters Dog River into a \"Quaintest Town in Canada\" competition, hoping that the $75,000 prize can save the town. Brent's mother Emma invites Lacey and Brent to dinner to spark a romance in a bid to acquire grandchildren. Hank has a falling-out with Brent after Brent refuses to invest in his plan to bring a corporate Coff-Nuts franchise to Dog River, which would hurt Lacey's restaurant. After Lacey advises a Coff-Nuts representative named Jerome that the town is broke, a woman representing a company called CN Holdings attempts to convince the townspeople to sell their homes. Hank overhears the woman and Jerome scheming, so he takes Jerome to Dog River's rival town Wullerton in hopes that Coff-Nuts will change its plan and ruin the rival town. Davis receives word and pursues Hank. Hank abandons Jerome and runs into Davis before Wullerton's astonishingly friendly citizens drive the two back to Dog River. Both distracted\u2014Brent by repairs to the bar, and Lacey by a quest to restore the town's electricity\u2014Brent and Lacey forget to attend Emma's dinner.\n\nAt the bar, Jerome announces that CN Holdings, a Coff-Nuts subsidiary, intends to use the bankrupt town's infrastructure to build a regional distribution centre. However, as he leaves the bar, he suffers an injury, causing him to file a lawsuit against Brent. Wanda volunteers to represent Brent, but she loses the case, causing Corner Gas to be confiscated and the bar to be condemned.\n\nFitzy later returns with a plan to allow Wullerton to annex Dog River, which proves unpopular. Brent and Lacey then rally the town to prepare for the \"Quaintest Town in Canada\" contest judge, Tina Fuller, to enter Dog River, but a series of mishaps creates the appearance of a riot in the middle of town. Everyone then gathers at The Ruby, where Lacey encourages everyone to financially support Brent, but Brent declines their aid due to the judgment against him. Tina sympathizes with the town's predicament and writes an article to garner public support for Dog River. The media attention forces Coff-Nuts to drop the lawsuit. Between the proceeds from Wanda's casino, Karen's tickets, and a fundraising drive by residents of Wullerton, the town is saved. Catastrophe averted, Lacey and Brent kiss, shocking everyone at The Ruby. Oscar encourages Brent to ask Lacey out, but they reveal that they have been dating for two years. Emma rejoices at the prospect of grandchildren but is distraught when Brent explains that he and Lacey have decided against having children.<ref name=CBC /><ref name=TorStar />\n\n==Cast==\nAll members of the regular television series cast reprised their roles for the film.<ref name=CBC />\n\n* [[Brent Butt]] as Brent Leroy\n* [[Gabrielle Miller]] as Lacey Burrows\n* [[Fred Ewanuick]] as Hank Yarbo\n* [[Eric Peterson]] as Oscar Leroy\n* [[Janet Wright]] as Emma Leroy\n* [[Lorne Cardinal]] as Davis Quinton\n* [[Tara Spencer-Nairn]] as Karen Pelly\n* [[Nancy Robertson (actress)|Nancy Robertson]] as Wanda Dollard\n* [[Don Lake]] as Jerome, the film's antagonist\n* [[Reagan Pasternak]] as Sasha, Jerome's associate\n* Cavan Cunningham as Fitzy Fitzgerald, mayor of Dog River\n* Karen Holness as Tina Fuller, a ''National Star'' reporter\n* Jean Freeman as Fitzy's grandma\n* Gwen Seed as Mertyl Runciman, a neighbour of Oscar and Emma Leroy\n* Russell Yuen as Won Hu\n* [[Michael Boisvert]] as Survivan Ivan\n\n[[Graham Greene (actor)|Graham Greene]], [[Will Sasso]], [[Jon Montgomery]], and sportscasters [[Jay Onrait]], [[Dan O'Toole]], and [[Darren Dutchyshen]] make [[cameo appearance]]s.\n\n==Production==\nShooting occurred in [[Rouleau, Saskatchewan]] from 22 June \u2013 22 July 2014.<ref name=CBC>{{cite news | url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/plot-unveiled-for-brent-butt-s-corner-gas-the-movie-1.2684981 | title=Plot unveiled for Brent Butt's Corner Gas: The Movie | publisher=CBC News | date=23 June 2014 | accessdate=19 November 2014 }}</ref><ref name=Global>{{cite news | url=http://globalnews.ca/news/1467424/filming-for-corner-gas-the-movie-wraps-up-in-sask/ | title=Filming for Corner Gas: The Movie wraps up in Sask. | first=Kim | last=Smith | publisher=Global Television | date=22 July 2014 | accessdate=19 November 2014 }}</ref>\n\nApproximately three-quarters of the $8.5 million budget was supported by government funding and credits.<ref name=NP /> This included $2.5 million from [[Telefilm Canada]], and approximately $2 million from Saskatchewan provincial sources ($1.5 million from Tourism Saskatchewan, $0.5 million from Creative Saskatchewan), plus $1.15 million in tax credits from the federal and Ontario provincial government.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/public-dollars-for-corner-gas-movie-cover-two-thirds-of-film-s-budget-1.2649025 | title=Public dollars for Corner Gas movie cover two-thirds of film's budget | publisher=CBC News | date=21 May 2014 | accessdate=1 January 2015 }}</ref> $285,840 was raised through individual donations during a [[Kickstarter]] campaign in May and June 2014, with $150,000 of this raised during the campaign's first two days.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://globalnews.ca/news/1501541/kickstarter-campaign-allows-california-family-to-tour-corner-gas/ | title=Kickstarter campaign allows California family to tour 'Corner Gas' | first=Jennifer | last=Graham | date=10 August 2014 | publisher=Global News | accessdate=6 January 2015 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1776228079/corner-gas-the-movie | title=Corner Gas: The Movie | publisher=Kickstarter | accessdate=6 January 2015 }}</ref><ref name=NP>{{cite news | url=http://news.nationalpost.com/2014/05/21/corner-gas-movies-8-5m-budget-is-75-from-government-funding-despite-success-of-the-original-tv-series/ | title=Corner Gas movie's $8.5M budget is 75% from government funding despite success of the original TV series | first=Tristin | last=Hopper | newspaper=National Post | date=21 May 2014 | accessdate=6 January 2015 }}</ref> A number of individuals who donated to the Kickstarter campaign appear as Dog River residents in the film.<ref>''Corner Gas: The Movie'', DVD executive producer commentary, 2014</ref>\n\n==Release==\nThe film's first public screening was 25 November 2014 in Regina at [[Canada Saskatchewan Production Studios]], followed by a gala in Ottawa on 1 December.<ref name=TorStar /> The film was screened in cinemas in Canada for a limited run from 3\u20149 December 2014, later extended to 14 December due to public demand.<ref>{{cite web|title=Back by Popular Demand -
