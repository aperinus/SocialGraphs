It stars [[Robert Montgomery (actor)|Robert Montgomery]], [[Claude Rains]] and [[Evelyn Keyes]].\n\nThe film script, based on [[Harry Segall]]'s 1938 play ''Heaven Can Wait'' (originally called ''It was Like This''),<ref>[https://books.google.no/books?id=8sxqowNQEdMC&pg=PA2&dq=%22under+the+title+It+was+Like+This%22&hl=no&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjerpHZ_6TrAhXkpIsKHY1hCGkQ6AEwAXoECAIQAg#v=onepage&q=%22under%20the%20title%20It%20was%20Like%20This%22&f=false Heaven Can Wait: Comedy-fantasy in Three Acts by Harry Segall]</ref> was written by [[Sidney Buchman]] and [[Seton I.

[[Warren Beatty]] later remade the film in 1978 as ''[[Heaven Can Wait (1978 film)|Heaven Can Wait]]''. The 2001 film ''[[Down to Earth (2001 film)|Down to Earth]]'', starring [[Chris Rock]], is also based on the play.\n\nColumbia was planning to release ''Here Comes Mr. Jordan'' on [[VHS]] and [[Betamax]] in November 1979 as one of [[Sony Pictures Home Entertainment|Columbia Pictures Home Entertainment]]'s launch titles, but for business reasons they did not release the film on home video until 1982. It was restored and released on [[DVD]] and [[Blu-ray]] by [[The Criterion Collection]] in 2016.\n\n{{TOC limit|limit=2}}\n\n==Plot==\nOn May 11, 1941, boxer and amateur pilot Joe Pendleton, affectionately known as \"the Flying Pug\", flies his small aircraft to his next fight in [[New York City]], but crashes when a control cable severs. His soul is retrieved by 7013, an officious angel who assumed that Joe could not have survived. Joe's manager, Max \"Pop\" Corkle, has his body cremated. In the [[afterlife]], the records show his death was a mistake; he was supposed to live for 50 more years. The angel's superior, Mr. Jordan, confirms this, but since there is no more body, Joe will have to [[Walk-in (concept)|take over a newly dead corpse]]. Jordan explains that a body is just something that is worn, like an overcoat; inside, Joe will still be himself. Joe insists that it be someone in good physical shape, because he wants to continue his boxing career.\n\nAfter Joe turns down several \"candidates\", Jordan takes him to see the body of a crooked, extremely wealthy banker and investor named Bruce Farnsworth, who has just been drugged and drowned in a bathtub by his wife Julia and his secretary, Tony Abbott. Joe is reluctant to take over a life so unlike his previous one, but when he sees the murderous pair mockingly berating Bette Logan, whose father's name has been misused by Farnsworth to sell worthless securities,<ref name=afi>[https://catalog.afi.com/Catalog/moviedetails/26737 Here Comes Mr. Jordan (1941) > Synopsis, catalog.afi.com] Retrieved 13 May 2018</ref> he changes his mind and agrees to take over Farnsworth's body.{{#tag:ref|The audience continues to see Montgomery as Pendleton, but everyone in the film, including his wife and secretary (who are astonished to see that the murder was not successful after all), see and hear Farnsworth.|group=Note}}\n\nAs Farnsworth, Joe repays all the investors and has Bette's father exonerated.<ref name=afi/> He sends for Corkle and convinces him that he is Joe (by playing his saxophone just as badly as he did in his previous incarnation). With Farnsworth's money to smooth the way, Corkle trains him and arranges a bout to decide who will next fight the current heavyweight champion, but Jordan returns to warn Joe that, while he is destined to be the champion, it cannot happen that way. Joe has just enough time to tell Bette, with whom he has fallen in love, that if a stranger (especially if he is a boxer) approaches her, to give him a chance. Then he is shot by Tony. While Joe returns to a ghostly existence, Farnsworth's body is hidden, with everyone believing Farnsworth has simply disappeared. Corkle hires a private investigator to find him.\n\nAccompanied by Jordan, Joe goes to retrieve his lucky saxophone he left on Farnsworth's piano and finds the police conducting a group interrogation. Corkle, talking to himself, wanders the room looking for Joe or Jordan. Corkle has explained about Joe, Mr. Jordan and the body-switching, to the police detective ([[Donald MacBride]]) who thinks he is a nut. Joe manages to mentally nudge Corkle into turning on the radio to hear the championship fight and hears that Murdock has collapsed from a slight grazing punch. Jordan reveals that the boxer was shot by gamblers because he refused to throw the fight. Joe takes over Murdock's body and wins the title. Back at the mansion, Corkle hears one of the radio announcers mention a saxophone hanging by the ringside and seeing the saxophone gone from the room, realizes Joe has assumed Murdock's body.\n\nCorkle races down to the dressing room. There, Joe passes along information from Jordan that Farnsworth's body is in a refrigerator in the basement of the mansion. Corkle tells the detective, who promptly has Julia and Tony arrested. As Murdock, Joe fires his old, crooked manager and hires Corkle. Jordan reveals to Joe that this is his destiny; he can be Murdock and live his life.\n\nHealing the gunshot wound and at the same time removing Joe's memory of his [[past life (reincarnation)|past life]], Jordan hangs around for a bit longer until Bette arrives. She wanted to see Corkle, but runs into Murdock instead. The pair feel they have met before. The two go off together, while Jordan smiles and says \"So long, champ.\"\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Robert Montgomery (actor)|Robert Montgomery]] as Joe Pendleton\n* [[Evelyn Keyes]] as Bette Logan\n* [[Claude Rains]] as [[God in Christianity|Mr. Jordan]]\n* [[Rita Johnson]] as Julia Farnsworth\n* [[Edward Everett Horton]] as Messenger 7013\n* [[James Gleason]] as Max \"Pop\" Corkle\n* [[John Emery (actor)|John Emery]] as Tony Abbott\n* [[Donald MacBride]] as Insp.
