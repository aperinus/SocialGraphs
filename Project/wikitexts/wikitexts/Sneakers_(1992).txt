Present 686 -->\nIn 1969, students Martin Brice and Cosmo are computer hackers who use their skills to finance left wing organizations. When Martin leaves for a pizza, Cosmo gets arrested, forcing Martin to become a fugitive.\n\nIn present-day San Francisco, Martin, now called Martin Bishop, heads a security specialists team undertaking [[penetration test]]ing. The team includes Donald Crease, a former [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] officer and family man; Darren \"Mother\" Roskow, a [[conspiracy theorist]] and electronics technician; Carl Arbogast, a young hacking genius; and Irwin \"Whistler\" Emery, a blind phone [[Phreaking|phreak]].\n\nAfter performing their services for a bank, Martin is approached by [[National Security Agency|NSA]] officers Dick Gordon and Buddy Wallace. He is asked to recover a \"black box\" from mathematician Dr. Gunter Janek, developed under the name \"Setec Astronomy\" supposedly for the Russian government. Martin is hesitant but agrees when the agents reveal that they are aware of his true identity and offer to clear his past in exchange. With help from his former girlfriend, Liz, Martin and his team secure the box, which is disguised as a telephone answering machine. During their subsequent celebration party, Whistler, Mother, and Carl investigate the box, finding it capable of breaking the encryption of nearly every computer system. Martin works out that \"Setec Astronomy\" is an anagram of \"too many secrets\", and issues a lockdown until they can deliver the box the next day.\n\nMartin hands the box to Gordon and Wallace but barely escapes being killed by them after Crease discovers that Janek was killed the night before. His friend, Gregor in the Russian consulate, confirms that the officers were rogue agents and that Janek was working for the NSA. Before Gregor can elaborate further, fake FBI agents kill him and kidnap Martin, taking him to a remote location where he is reunited with Cosmo, who Martin thought had died in prison. While imprisoned, Cosmo developed ties with organized crime, who recognized his talents and later installed him as their money launderer and paymaster. Cosmo plans to use Janek's box to destabilize the world economy and offers Martin the chance to join him. Martin refuses, whereupon Cosmo uses the box to break into the FBI's mainframe and connect Martin's current identity with his former name. Cosmo has Martin knocked out and taken back to the city.\n\nMartin, now a fugitive from the law again, relocates his team to Liz's apartment. They contact NSA agent Abbott, who wants the box but cannot offer safety until it is in Martin's possession. Whistler analyzes the sounds that Martin heard during his kidnapping and can identify the geographic area where Martin was taken, a toy company acting as a front for Cosmo's operation. They research the building's security systems and identify Werner Brandes, an employee whose office is next to Cosmo's. They set Liz up on a fake computer date with Brandes to obtain his keycard and vocal recognition codes, which Martin and the other team members use to initiate the recovery of the box.\n\nBrandes begins to suspect Liz during the date and brings her to Cosmo at his office. Nothing appears amiss, and Cosmo lets Liz go, but when she comments on this being a computer date, Cosmo recognizes Martin's handiwork, and locks down the facility. Martin is apprehended and Cosmo once again tries to convince him to join him. Martin refuses and instead turns over the box. The team escapes before Cosmo realizes that he is holding an empty duplicate.\n\nBack at their own offices, Martin's team is surrounded by Abbott and his agents. After Martin points out how important the secrecy of the box is to the NSA, who could use it to spy on other agencies, Abbott agrees to clear Martin's record and grant the requests of the rest of his team. After Abbott and the agents leave with the box, Martin shows he has rendered the box useless by removing the main processor.\n\nIn a postscript, a news report describes the sudden bankruptcy of the [[Republican National Committee]], and the simultaneous receipt of large anonymous donations to [[Amnesty International]], [[Greenpeace]], and the [[United Negro College Fund]].\n\n== Cast ==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Robert Redford]] as Martin Bishop / Martin Brice\n* [[Ben Kingsley]] as Cosmo\n* [[Sidney Poitier]] as Donald Crease\n* [[David Strathairn]] as Irwin 'Whistler' Emery\n* [[Dan Aykroyd]] as Darren 'Mother' Roskow\n* [[River Phoenix]] as Carl Arbogast\n* [[Mary McDonnell]] as Liz Ogilvy\n* [[Stephen Tobolowsky]] as Werner Brandes\n* [[Timothy Busfield]] as Dick Gordon\n* [[Eddie Jones (actor)|Eddie Jones]] as Buddy Wallace\n* [[George Hearn]] as Gregor \"Greg\" Ivanovich\n* [[Donal Logue]] as Dr. Gunter Janek\n* [[Lee Garlington]] as Dr. Elena Rhyzkov\n* [[James Earl Jones]] as NSA Agent Bernard Abbott}}\n\n== Production ==\nLawrence Lasker and Walter F. Parkes first conceived the idea for ''Sneakers'' in 1981, while doing research for ''[[WarGames]]''.<ref name=\"Weidman\">{{cite news | last=Weidman | first=Sara | title=A Decade Later, 'Sneakers' is Complete | work=The Michigan Daily | date=October 8, 1992 | page=8}}</ref> In early drafts, the character of Liz was a bank employee, rather than Martin's ex-girlfriend. The role was changed because Lasker and Parkes believed that it took too long for her character to develop.<ref name=\"Weidman\" />\n\nOnce Robert Redford was attached to the picture, his name was used to recruit other members of the cast and crew, including the director Robinson, who had little initial interest in the project but had always wanted to work with Redford.<ref name=\"Weidman\" />\n\nAt one point during the project, Robinson received a visit from men claiming to be representatives of the [[Office of Naval Intelligence]], who indicated that for reasons of national security, the film could not include any references to \"a hand-held device that can decode codes\". Robinson was highly concerned, as such a device was a key to the film's plot, but after consulting with a lawyer from the film studio he realized that the \"visit\" had been a prank instigated by a member of the cast, possibly Aykroyd or Redford.<ref name=\"Weidman\" />\n\n\"I can't remember having so much fun on a movie,\" Stephen Tobolowsky recalled in 2012 for a 20th-anniversary piece about the film for ''[[Slate (website)|Slate]]''. He had initially scoffed at the script based on its title alone, but his agent persuaded him to read it, and he reconsidered.

It set the tone for the rest of the shoot,\" he recalls. \"I played with my food. I made up lines (including one about pounding chicken breasts in the kitchen during our second date).\" The rest of the cast and crew felt similarly. Near the end of the shoot, Robinson said the only way it could have been better would have been if the lab lost the film, so they would have had to do it all over again.<ref name=\" Tobolowsky\" />\n\n[[Leonard Adleman]] was  the mathematical consultant on this movie.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Sneakers|url = http://www.usc.edu/dept/molecular-science/fm-sneakers.htm|website = www.usc.edu|access-date = 2015-11-24|url-status = dead|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20151101121012/http://www.usc.edu/dept/molecular-science/fm-sneakers.htm|archive-date = 2015-11-01}}</ref>\n\n== Release ==\nThe film's [[press kit]] was accompanied by a [[floppy disk]] containing a custom program explaining the movie.

He singled out Redford and Poitier as looking and acting too old to be in this kind of film now. He calls the plot \"feeble,\" resulting in a film that is \"jokey without being funny, breathless without creating suspense\". He calls the ensemble an \"all-star gang,\" but says the \"performances are generally quite bad.\"<ref>{{cite news|title=Reviews/Film; A 1970's Caper Movie With Heroes of the Time|url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9E0CE6D6103EF93AA3575AC0A964958260|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=1992-09-09|access-date=2012-06-03|archive-date=2012-09-10|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120910184553/http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9E0CE6D6103EF93AA3575AC0A964958260|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nOn [[Rotten Tomatoes]] the film has an approval rating of 80% based on reviews from 54 critics.
