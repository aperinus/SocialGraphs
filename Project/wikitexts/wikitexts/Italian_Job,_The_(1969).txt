The film's plot centres around Cockney criminal Charlie Croker, recently released from prison, who forms a gang for the job of stealing a cache of [[gold bullion]] being transported through the city of [[Turin]], [[Italy]] in an armoured security truck. In addition to Caine, the film's cast also included [[Benny Hill]], [[Raf Vallone]], [[Tony Beckley]], and [[No\u00ebl Coward]]; the film was Coward's last before his retirement from acting. The soundtrack was composed by [[Quincy Jones]], featuring the songs \"[[On Days Like These]]\", sung by [[Matt Monro]] over the opening credits, and \"Getta Bloomin' Move On\" (usually referred to as \"The Self-Preservation Society\", after its chorus) during the climactic car chase, which featured Caine among its singers.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.theitalianjob.com/the_film_soundtrack.htm | title = The Film \u2013 Soundtrack | work=The Italian Job.com | access-date = 9 September 2007 }}</ref>\n\nThe film proved a success upon its release, earning critical acclaim amongst critics for the performances by Caine and Coward, the film's reflection of British culture from the period, and the film's climactic car chase. ''The Italian Job'' became a cult symbol of British filmography and was ranked favourably in the top 100 British films by the [[British Film Institute]]. Several elements from the film became symbolic cult features, including the film's [[cliffhanger]] ending,<ref>{{cite news |title=I had a better idea': writer's original finish for 'Italian Job |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/news/i-had-a-better-idea-writers-original-finish-for-italian-job-435666.html |access-date=19 August 2019 |work=The Independent}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title= At last Michael Caine reveals ending to the Italian Job|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/celebritynews/3533647/At-last-Michael-Caine-reveals-ending-to-the-Italian-Job.html |access-date=19 August 2019 |work=The Telegraph}}</ref> and Caine's infamous line from the film.\n\nThe popularity of ''The Italian Job'' led to several parodies and allusions in other films and productions, including the 2005 episode of ''[[The Simpsons]]'' titled \"[[The Italian Bob]]\", and a re-enactment of the [[Mini (marque)|Mini Cooper]] car-chase in the ''[[MacGyver (1985 TV series, season 1)#Episodes|MacGyver]]'' episode \"Thief of Budapest\".<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.tv.com/as-if/312-italian-job/episode/117505/summary.html | title = As If: 312 (Italian Job) | work = [[TV.com]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] | access-date = 4 January 2009 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.tv.com/the-simpsons/the-italian-bob/episode/425857/trivia.html | title = The Simpsons: The Italian Bob | work = [[TV.com]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] | access-date = 4 January 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090328151402/http://www.tv.com/the-simpsons/the-italian-bob/episode/425857/trivia.html|archive-date=28 March 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.tv.com/macgyver/thief-of-budapest/episode/47206/summary.html | title = MacGyver: 103 (Thief of Budapest) | work = [[TV.com]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] | access-date = 4 January 2009 }}</ref> The film itself was later given a [[The Italian Job (2001 video game)|video game adaptation]] in 2001, before receiving [[The Italian Job (2003 film)|a remake]] in 2003.

Meanwhile, his friend and fellow thief Charlie Croker is released from prison, reuniting with his girlfriend Lorna to enjoy his first taste of freedom. Leaving her to meet with Beckermann for a job he was planning in [[Italy]], Croker is shocked to meet his widow instead. She insists he continues with her late husband's plans, which he had completed before his death and involves a strategic heist of $4 million in gold bullion from a security convoy intended as a down payment to the [[Government of Italy|Italian government]] by [[China]] for a car factory.\n\nCroker approaches British nationalist crime lord Mr. Bridger for financial backing, while they are serving time in his former prison. Initially unconvinced, Bridger soon offers support when he learns of the heist's target. With help from Bridger's organisation, run by his right-hand man Camp Freddie, Croker recruits a crew of specialists, including Lorna and computer expert Professor Peach &nbsp;\u2013 the latter for sabotaging Turin's [[Advanced Traffic Management System|traffic control system]]. After finalizing preparations, Croker and his team are summoned by Bridger to a faked funeral ceremony, where he informs them that the Mafia killed Beckermann because of his planned heist, advising them to be careful but not to return without the gold.\n\nAfter leaving for Italy, Croker and some of his crew split off from the others while enroute to Turin, to avoid raising suspicion. However, the small group soon encounter the Mafia waiting for them in the Alps, led by their boss Altabani, who attempts to dissuade them from their plans, effectively destroying the getaways cars they had set aside for an emergency. Despite the confrontation, Croker goes ahead with the heist. His crew infiltrate the Turin traffic control centre later that night, whereupon Peach replaces one of the computer's [[magnetic tape data storage]] reels with a duplicate designed to sabotage Turin's traffic control system on the day of the heist. The next day, as the gold arrives and the crew prepare for the heist, Croker sends Lorna to [[Geneva]] to protect her and the plan. At the same time, Peach absconds from the crew, and is later arrested for molesting a woman on a tram.\n\nAfter ensuring the [[closed circuit television]] traffic monitoring cameras are sabotaged, the Turin traffic control system begins to malfunction and creates a massive traffic jam. The crew swiftly ambush the gold convoy outside the [[Museo Egizio]] as it is stalled by the traffic jam. Subduing the police and moving the van inside the building, they divide the gold between the boots of three [[Mini Cooper]]s. Most of the crew then escape the building disguised as football fans, as Croker leads the rest out of the city in the Minis as the police move to stop them. Following a set route designed by Beckermann, the crew escape from Turin with the gold, and rendezvous with a coach to collect the Minis before they reach the Alps. Once aboard, the group unload the gold, dispose of the Minis in the Alps, and collect the rest of the crew.\n\nAs Bridger celebrates with his fellow prisoners and staff back home in England upon hearing of their success, the crew celebrate with beer as they go along the twisting mountain road. However, the coach suddenly loses control and teeters over a cliff, with the gold balancing over the edge. Croker soon contemplates how to save themselves and the gold (which slides further away as he tries to get it), and claims he has a \"great idea\" as the film concludes on a literal cliffhanger.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast list|\n* [[Michael Caine]] as Charlie Croker\n* [[No\u00ebl Coward]] as Mr. Bridger\n* [[Benny Hill]] as Professor Simon Peach\n* [[Raf Vallone]] as Altabani\n* [[Tony Beckley]] as Camp Freddie\n* [[Rossano Brazzi]] as Roger Beckermann\n* [[Maggie Blye]] as Lorna\n* [[Irene Handl]] as Miss Peach\n* [[John Le Mesurier]] as the Prison Governor\n* [[Fred Emney]] as Birkinshaw\n* [[John Clive]] as Garage manager\n* [[Graham Payn]] as Keats\n* [[Michael Standing (actor)|Michael Standing]] as Arthur\n* [[Stanley Caine]] as Coco\n* Barry Cox as Chris <!-- NOT the Barry Cox (born 1977) -->\n* [[Harry Baird (actor)|Harry Baird]] as Big William\n* [[George Innes]] as Bill Bailey\n* [[John Forgeham]] as Frank\n* [[Robert Powell]] as Yellow\n* [[Derek Ware (actor)|Derek Ware]] as Rozzer\n* [[Frank Jarvis (actor)|Frank Jarvis]] as Roger\n* David Salamone as Dominic\n* Richard Essame as Tony\n* Mario Valgoi as Manzo\n* Renato Romano<sup>([[:it:Renato Romano|in Italian]])</sup> as Cosca\n* Franco Norvelli as Altabani's driver\n* [[Robert Rietti]] as Police chief\n* [[Timothy Bateson]] as Dentist\n* [[David Kelly (actor)|David Kelly]] as Vicar\n* [[Arnold Diamond]] as Senior computer room official\n* [[Simon Dee]] as Shirtmaker\n* Alistair Hunter as Warder\n* Lana Gatto as Mrs. Cosca\n* [[Louis Mansi]] as Computer room official\n* [[Henry McGee]] as Tailor\n* [[Lelia Goldoni]] as Mrs Beckermann\n* [[Valerie Leon]] as Hotel Receptionist\n}}\n\n==Production==\n===Ending===\nAccording to a \"Making Of\" documentary,<ref name = \"makingof\">{{IMDb title|id=0392391|title=The Making of \"The Italian Job\"}}</ref> producer Deeley was unsatisfied with the four written endings and conceived the current ending as a literal [[cliffhanger]] appropriate to an action film which left an opportunity for a [[sequel]].

A contemporary review in ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine felt that the film spent too much time focusing on the film's caper as opposed to building the characters; it also criticised the car chases as 'dull and deafening'.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,901493,00.html | title = Cinema: Britannia Waives the Rules | work = [[Time (magazine)|Time]] | access-date = 16 October 2011 | date=19 September 1969}}</ref>\n\nThe movie was the 14th most popular at the UK box office in 1969.<ref>{{cite news|title=The World's Top Twenty Films |work=[[Sunday Times]] |date=27 September 1970 |via=The Sunday Times Digital Archive }}</ref> Although it received a [[Golden Globe Award|Golden Globe]] nomination for \"Best English-Language Foreign Film\", the film was not a success in the US. The film remains popular, however. James Travers of Films de France believes that the film's enduring appeal rests in the 'improbable union' of Michael Caine, No\u00ebl Coward and [[Benny Hill]], whom he considers \"three of the best known [British] performers... in the late 1960s\". He states that the film has a [[cult following|cult status]] and stands as a 'classic of its genre'.<ref name=\"france\"/>\n\n==Legacy==\nSince 2000, there have been two remakes of the film. The first was released in 2003 and also called ''[[The Italian Job (2003 film)|The Italian Job]]'', set in [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]] and starring [[Mark Wahlberg]] as Charlie Croker. It features [[Donald Sutherland]] as John Bridger, played as more of a father figure to Croker. It employs the updated [[Mini (BMW)|Mini Cooper]] for a chase towards the end. An official [[Bollywood]] remake of the 2003 film, called ''[[Players (2012 film)|Players]]'', was released in 2012.<ref>{{cite web|title=India to Remake 'The Italian Job'|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/india-remake-italian-job-48404|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|publisher=[[Prometheus Global Media]]|access-date=11 July 2018|first=Nyay|last=Bhushan|date=23 November 2010}}</ref>\n\n[[File:De La Warr Pavilion, 28 August 2012 (6).jpg|thumb|right|The artwork ''Hang On A Minute Lads, I've Got A Great Idea'' by [[Richard Wilson (sculptor)|Richard Wilson]] on the [[De La Warr Pavilion]] in [[Bexhill-on-Sea]], East Sussex, England.]]\nThere is a [[The Italian Job (2001 video game)|video game]] based on the 1969 film, released for the [[PlayStation]] [[Video game console|game console]] in 2001 and [[Microsoft Windows]] in 2002 and published by [[Rockstar Games]].
