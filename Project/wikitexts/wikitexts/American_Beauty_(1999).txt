[[Kevin Spacey]] stars as Lester Burnham, an advertising executive who has a [[midlife crisis]] when he becomes infatuated with his teenage daughter's best friend, played by [[Mena Suvari]]. [[Annette Bening]] stars as Lester's materialistic wife, Carolyn, and [[Thora Birch]] plays their insecure daughter, Jane. [[Wes Bentley]], [[Chris Cooper]], and [[Allison Janney]] co-star. Academics have described the film as satirizing how beauty and personal satisfaction are perceived by the American middle class; further analysis has focused on the film's explorations of romantic and paternal love, sexuality, materialism, self-liberation, and redemption.\n\nAfter being filmed in California from December 1998 to February 1999, ''American Beauty'' was released in North America on September 17, 1999, receiving widespread critical and popular acclaim. It was the second-best-reviewed American film of the year behind ''[[Being John Malkovich]]'' and grossed over $350&nbsp;million worldwide against its $15-million budget. Reviewers praised most aspects of the production, with particular emphasis on Mendes, Spacey and Ball; criticism tended to focus on the familiarity of the characters and setting. DreamWorks launched a major campaign to increase ''American Beauty''{{'}}s chances of [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] success following its controversial [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]] snubs for ''[[Saving Private Ryan]]'' (1998) the previous year. \n\nAt the [[72nd Academy Awards]], the film won several Oscars, including Best Picture, along with [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]] for Mendes, [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] for Spacey, [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay|Best Original Screenplay]] for Ball, and [[Academy Award for Best Cinematography|Best Cinematography]] for Hall. The film was nominated for and won many other awards and honors, mainly for directing, writing, and acting. Retrospective reviews have been more mixed, with criticism towards the screenplay, social commentary, and parallels between the film's protagonist and allegations of sexual misconduct against Spacey.<ref name=\"HuffPost 20th anniversary story\">{{cite web |last=Jacobs |first=Matthew |title=The Steady Cultural Demise Of 'American Beauty' |url=https://www.huffpost.com/entry/american-beauty-legacy-20-years-later_n_5d5c344fe4b0d1e1136902be |website=[[The Huffington Post]] |date=September 9, 2019 |access-date=September 10, 2019 |archive-date=September 10, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190910080054/https://www.huffpost.com/entry/american-beauty-legacy-20-years-later_n_5d5c344fe4b0d1e1136902be |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=\"Time magazine\">{{cite magazine |last1=Zacharek |first1=Stephanie |title=American Beauty Was Bad 20 Years Ago and It's Bad Now.

Their 16-year-old daughter, Jane, abhors her parents and has low self esteem. Retired [[United States Marine Corps|US Marine]] [[Colonel (United States)|colonel]] Frank Fitts, his near-catatonic wife Barbara, and their teenage son Ricky, move in next door. Ricky documents the world around him with a camcorder, collecting recordings on videotapes in his bedroom, while using his part-time catering jobs as a front for dealing cannabis. A strict disciplinarian, Frank has previously had Ricky committed to a psychiatric hospital and sent to military academy. Gay couple Jim Olmeyer and Jim Berkley, also neighbors to the Burnhams, welcome the Fitts family. Frank reveals his animus towards homosexuality later when angrily discussing the encounter with Ricky.\n\nDuring a dance routine at a school basketball game, Lester becomes infatuated with Jane's cheerleader friend, Angela. He starts having sexual fantasies about her in which red rose petals are a recurring motif. Carolyn begins an affair with married business rival Buddy Kane. Lester is informed by his supervisor that he is to be laid off; Lester blackmails him into giving him an indulgent [[severance package]] and starts working at a [[Drive-through#Drive through restaurants|drive-through restaurant]]. He buys his dream car, a 1970 [[Pontiac Firebird#Second generation (1970\u20131981)|Pontiac Firebird]], and starts working out after overhearing Angela teasing Jane that she would have sex with him if he improved his physique. He begins smoking cannabis supplied by Ricky and flirts with Angela. The girls' friendship wanes when Jane starts a relationship with Ricky whom Angela scoffs at. Ricky and Jane bond over what Ricky considers the most beautiful image he has ever filmed: a plastic bag blowing in the wind.\n\nLester discovers Carolyn's infidelity when she and Kane unknowingly go to Lester's drive-through but reacts indifferently. Fearing a costly divorce, Buddy ends the affair, while Carolyn is humiliated and simultaneously frustrated by her lack of professional success. Frank, suspicious of Lester and Ricky's friendship, finds footage Ricky captured by chance of Lester lifting weights naked and wrongly concludes they are sexually involved. He viciously accuses Ricky of prostitution which the latter falsely admits in order to goad his father into expelling him. Carolyn, sitting distraught in her car, withdraws a handgun from the glove box. At home, Jane is arguing with Angela over her flirtation with Lester when Ricky interrupts to ask Jane to leave with him for New York City. He calls Angela ugly, boring, and ordinary.\n\nFrank tentatively approaches Lester then breaks down and tearfully embraces him. Lester begins to comfort Frank until Frank attempts to kiss him. Lester gently rebuffs him, saying he had misunderstood, and Frank walks back out into the rain. Lester finds Angela sitting alone in the dark. He consoles her, saying she is beautiful and anything but ordinary. He asks what she wants and she says she does not know. She asks him what he wants and he says he has always wanted her. He takes her to the couch and as he begins to undress her, Angela reveals her virginity. Lester is taken aback to realize her apparent experience was a veil for her innocence and he cannot continue.\n\nLester comforts her as they share their frustrations in life. Angela goes to the bathroom as Lester smiles at a family photograph, when an unseen figure (who turns out to be Frank due to the [[pistol]] being the same as the one in his collection; a [[SIG Sauer P226]]) shoots Lester in the back of the head at [[point-blank range]]. Ricky and Jane find Lester's body. Carolyn is in her closet discarding her gun, and crying hysterically as she hugs Lester\u2019s clothing. A bloodied Frank, wearing surgical gloves, returns home: a gun is missing from his collection.\n\nLester's closing narration describes meaningful experiences during his life; he says that, despite his death, he is happy there is still so much beauty in the world.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col}}\n*[[Kevin Spacey]] as Lester Burnham\n*[[Annette Bening]] as Carolyn Burnham\n*[[Thora Birch]] as Jane Burnham\n*[[Wes Bentley]] as Ricky Fitts\n*[[Mena Suvari]] as Angela Hayes\n*[[Peter Gallagher]] as Buddy Kane\n*[[Allison Janney]] as Barbara Fitts\n*[[Chris Cooper]] as Col.

Mendes is indecisive, saying the script seemed to be about something different each time he read it: \"a mystery story, a kaleidoscopic journey through American suburbia, a series of love stories;&nbsp;... it was about imprisonment,&nbsp;... loneliness, [and] beauty. It was funny; it was angry, sad.\"<ref name=\"booth 126\"/> The literary critic and author [[Wayne C. Booth]] concludes that the film resists any one interpretation: \"[''American Beauty''] cannot be adequately summarized as 'here is a satire on what's wrong with American life'; that plays down the celebration of beauty. It is more tempting to summarize it as 'a portrait of the beauty underlying American miseries and misdeeds', but that plays down the scenes of cruelty and horror, and Ball's disgust with mores. It cannot be summarized with either Lester or Ricky's philosophical statements about what life is or how one should live.\"<ref name=\"booth 129\"/> He argues that the problem of interpreting the film is tied with that of finding its center\u2014a controlling voice who \"[unites] all of the choices\".{{refn|Some postmodernist readings would posit no need for an identified voice; see [[Death of the Author]].|group=\"nb\"}}<ref name=\"booth 126\">{{harvnb|Booth|2002|p=126}}</ref> He contends that in ''American Beauty''{{'}}s case, it is neither Mendes nor Ball.<ref name=\"booth 128\">{{harvnb|Booth|2002|p=128}}</ref> Mendes considers the voice to be Ball's, but even while the writer was \"strongly influential\" on set,<ref name=\"booth 126\"/> he often had to accept deviations from his vision,<ref name=\"booth 128\"/> particularly ones that transformed the cynical tone of his script into something more optimistic.<ref name=\"booth 126\u2013128\">{{harvnb|Booth|2002|pages=126\u2013128}}</ref> With \"innumerable voices intruding on the original author's,\" Booth says, those who interpret ''American Beauty'' \"have forgotten to probe for the elusive center\". According to Booth, the film's true controller is the creative energy \"that hundreds of people put into its production, agreeing and disagreeing, inserting and cutting\".<ref name=\"booth 129\"/>\n\n===Imprisonment and redemption===\n[[Image:American Beauty jail cell.png|thumb|alt=A computer monitor on a busy cubicle desk: The monitor displays a spreadsheet in seven columns which span the height of the screen. The monitor also shows the reflection of a middle-aged man in a shirt and tie, sitting close to the desk and wearing a telephone headset. The contrasts\u2014the monitor's dark background, and the lightness of the text and the man's shirt\u2014make the reflection more prominent between and behind the numbers.| The theme of imprisonment is evoked in this scene showing Lester's reflection in the monitor behind columns of data, which resembles an inmate in a [[jail cell]].<ref name=\"chapter 1\"/><ref name=\"anker 348-349\"/>]]\nMendes called ''American Beauty'' a rite of passage film about imprisonment and escape from imprisonment. The monotony of Lester's existence is established through his gray, nondescript workplace and characterless clothing.<ref name=\"chapter 1\"/> In these scenes, he is often framed as if trapped, \"reiterating rituals that hardly please him\". He masturbates in the confines of his shower;<ref name=\"hausmann 118\">{{harvnb|Hausmann|2004|p=118}}</ref> the shower stall evokes a jail cell and the shot is the first of many where Lester is confined behind bars or within frames,<ref name=\"chapter 1\"/><ref name=\"anker 348-349\">{{harvnb|Anker|2004|pp=348\u2013349}}</ref> such as when he is reflected behind columns of numbers on a computer monitor, \"confined [and] nearly crossed out\".<ref name=\"hausmann 118\"/> The academic and author Jody W. Pennington argues that Lester's journey is the story's center.<ref name=\"pennington 104\"/> His sexual reawakening through meeting Angela is the first of several turning points as he begins to \"[throw] off the responsibilities of the comfortable life he has come to despise\".<ref name=\"Munt 264-265\"/> After Lester shares a [[joint (cannabis)|joint]] with Ricky, his spirit is released and he begins to rebel against Carolyn.<ref>{{harvnb|Mendes|Ball|2000|loc=chapter 8}}</ref> Changed by Ricky's \"attractive, profound confidence\", he is convinced that Angela is attainable and sees that he must question his \"banal, numbingly materialist suburban existence\"; he takes a job at a fast-food outlet, which allows him to regress to a point when he could \"see his whole life ahead of him\".<ref name=\"hausmann 118-119\">{{harvnb|Hausmann|2004|pages=118\u2013119}}</ref>\n\nWhen Lester is caught masturbating by Carolyn, his angry retort about their lack of intimacy is the first time he says aloud what he thinks about her.<ref name=\"chapter 11\"/> By confronting the issue and Carolyn's \"superficial investments in others\", he is trying to \"regain a voice in a home that [only respects] the voices of mother and daughter\".<ref name=\"hausmann 118-119\"/> His final turning point comes when he and Angela almost have sex;<ref name=\"chapter 25\"/> after she confesses her virginity, he no longer thinks of her as a sex object, but as a daughter.<ref name=\"pennington 105\"/> He holds her close and \"wraps her up\". Mendes called it \"the most satisfying end to [Lester's] journey there could possibly have been\". With these final scenes, Mendes intended to show him at the conclusion of a \"mythical quest\". After Lester gets a beer from the refrigerator, the camera pushes toward him, then stops facing a hallway down which he walks \"to meet his fate\".<ref name=\"chapter 25\"/><ref name=\"kemp 26\"/> Having begun to act his age again, Lester achieves closure.<ref name=\"pennington 105\">{{harvnb|Pennington|2007|p=105}}</ref> As he smiles at a family photo, the camera pans slowly from Lester to the kitchen wall, onto which blood spatters as a gunshot rings out; the slow pan reflects the peace of his death.<ref>{{harvnb|Mendes|Ball|2000|loc=chapter 26}}</ref> His body is discovered by Jane and Ricky. Mendes said that Ricky's staring into Lester's dead eyes is \"the culmination of the theme\" of the film: that beauty is found where it is least expected.<ref>{{harvnb|Mendes|Ball|2000|loc=chapter 27}}</ref>\n\n===Conformity and beauty===\nLike other [[List of American films of 1999|American films of 1999]]\u2014such as ''[[Fight Club]]'', ''[[Bringing Out the Dead]]'' and ''[[Magnolia (film)|Magnolia]]'', ''American Beauty'' instructs its audience to \"[lead] more meaningful lives\".<ref>Desowitz, Bill (December 12, 1999).

''[[The New York Times]]'': 215.</ref> The film argues the case against conformity, but does not deny that people need and want it; even the gay characters just want to fit in.<ref name=\"Munt 265\"/> Jim and Jim, the Burnhams' other neighbors, are a satire of \"gay bourgeois coupledom\",<ref name=\"munt 274\">{{harvnb|Munt|2006|p=274}}</ref> who \"[invest] in the numbing sameness\" that the film criticizes in heterosexual couples.{{refn|Despite their desire to conform, Jim and Jim are openly, proudly gay, a contradiction that [[Sally Rowena Munt|Sally R. Munt]] says may seem strange to heterosexual audiences.<ref name=\"Munt 265\"/>|group=\"nb\"}}<ref>{{harvnb|Hausmann|2004|p=112}}</ref> The feminist academic and author [[Sally Rowena Munt|Sally R. Munt]] argues that ''American Beauty'' uses its \"art house\" trappings to direct its message of nonconformity primarily to the middle classes, and that this approach is a \"''clich\u00e9'' of bourgeois preoccupation;&nbsp;... the underlying premise being that the luxury of finding an individual 'self' through denial and renunciation is always open to those wealthy enough to choose, and sly enough to present themselves sympathetically as a rebel.\"<ref name=\"Munt 264-265\">{{harvnb|Munt|2006|pp=264\u2013265}}</ref>\n\nProfessor Roy M. Anker argues that the film's thematic center is its direction to the audience to \"look closer\". The opening combines an unfamiliar viewpoint of the Burnhams' neighborhood with Lester's narrated admission that this is the last year of his life, forcing audiences to consider their own mortality and the beauty around them.<ref name=\"anker 345\">{{harvnb|Anker|2004|p=345}}</ref> It also sets a series of mysteries; Anker asks, \"from what place exactly, and from what state of being, is he telling this story? If he's already dead, why bother with whatever it is he wishes to tell about his last year of being alive? There is also the question of how Lester has died\u2014or will die.\" Anker believes the preceding scene\u2014Jane's discussion with Ricky about the possibility of his killing her father\u2014adds further mystery.<ref name=\"anker 347\">{{harvnb|Anker|2004|p=347}}</ref> Professor Ann C. Hall disagrees; she says by presenting an early resolution to the mystery, the film allows the audience to put it aside \"to view the film and its philosophical issues\".<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2006|p=24}}</ref> Through this examination of Lester's life, rebirth and death, ''American Beauty'' satirizes American middle class notions of meaning, beauty and satisfaction.<ref name=\"anker 347\u2013348\">{{harvnb|Anker|2004|pp=347\u2013348}}</ref> Even Lester's transformation only comes about because of the possibility of sex with Angela; he therefore remains a \"willing devotee of the popular media's exaltation of pubescent male sexuality as a sensible route to personal wholeness\".<ref name=\"anker 348\">{{harvnb|Anker|2004|p=348}}</ref> Carolyn is similarly driven by conventional views of happiness; from her belief in \"[[House Beautiful|house beautiful]]\" domestic bliss to her car and gardening outfit, Carolyn's domain is a \"fetching American millennial vision of Pleasantville, or [[Garden of Eden|Eden]]\".<ref name=\"anker 349\u2013350\">{{harvnb|Anker|2004|pp=349\u2013350}}</ref> The Burnhams are unaware that they are \"materialists philosophically, and devout consumers ethically\" who expect the \"rudiments of American beauty\" to give them happiness. Anker argues that \"they are helpless in the face of the prettified economic and sexual stereotypes&nbsp;... that they and their culture have designated for their salvation.\"<ref name=\"anker 350\"/>\n\nThe film presents Ricky as its \"visionary,&nbsp;... spiritual and mystical center\".<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2006|p=27}}</ref> He sees beauty in the minutiae of everyday life, videoing as much as he can for fear of missing it. He shows Jane what he considers the most beautiful thing he has filmed: a plastic bag, tossing in the wind in front of a wall. He says capturing the moment was when he realized that there was \"an entire life behind things\"; he feels that \"sometimes there's so much beauty in the world I feel like I can't take it... and my heart is going to cave in.\" Anker argues that Ricky, in looking past the \"cultural dross\", has \"[grasped] the radiant splendor of the created world\" to see God.<ref name=\"anker 356\">{{harvnb|Anker|2004|p=356}}</ref> As the film progresses, the Burnhams move closer to Ricky's view of the world.<ref>{{harvnb|Anker|2004|p=360}}</ref> Lester only forswears personal satisfaction at the film's end. On the cusp of having sex with Angela, he returns to himself after she admits her virginity. Suddenly confronted with a child, he begins to treat her as a daughter; in doing so, Lester sees himself, Angela, and his family \"for the poor and fragile but wondrous creatures they are\". He looks at a picture of his family in happier times,<ref name=\"anker 358\u2013359\">{{harvnb|Anker|2004|pp=358\u2013359}}</ref> and dies having had an epiphany that infuses him with \"wonder, joy, and soul-shaking gratitude\"\u2014he has finally seen the world as it is.<ref name=\"anker 347\u2013348\"/>\n\nAccording to Patti Bellantoni, colors are used symbolically throughout the film,<ref name=\"color 25\">{{harvnb|Bellantoni|2005|p=25}}</ref> none more so than red, which is an important thematic signature that drives the story and \"[defines] Lester's arc\". First seen in drab colors that reflect his passivity, Lester surrounds himself with red as he regains his individuality.<ref name=\"color 27\">{{harvnb|Bellantoni|2005|p=27}}</ref> The [[Rosa 'American Beauty'|American Beauty rose]] is repeatedly used as symbol; when Lester fantasizes about Angela, she is usually naked and surrounded by rose petals. In these scenes, the rose symbolizes Lester's desire for her. When associated with Carolyn, the rose represents a \"fa\u00e7ade for suburban success\".<ref name=\"pennington 104\"/> Roses are included in almost every shot inside the Burnhams' home, where they signify \"a mask covering a bleak, unbeautiful reality\".<ref name=\"anker 350\">{{harvnb|Anker|2004|p=350}}</ref> Carolyn feels that \"as long as there can be roses, all is well\".<ref name=\"anker 350\"/> She cuts the roses and puts them in vases,<ref name=\"pennington 104\"/> where they adorn her \"meretricious vision of what makes for beauty\"<ref name=\"anker 350\"/> and begin to die.<ref name=\"pennington 104\"/> The roses in the vase in the Angela\u2013Lester seduction scene symbolize Lester's previous life and Carolyn; the camera pushes in as Lester and Angela get closer, finally taking the roses\u2014and thus Carolyn\u2014out of the shot.<ref name=\"chapter 25\"/> Lester's epiphany at the end of the film is expressed by rain and the use of red, building to a crescendo that is a deliberate contrast to the release Lester feels.<ref name=\"shohan\"/> The constant use of red \"lulls [the audience] subliminally\" into becoming used to it; consequently, it leaves the audience unprepared when Lester is shot and his blood spatters on the wall.<ref name=\"color 27\"/>\n\n===Sexuality and repression===\nPennington argues that ''American Beauty'' defines its characters through their sexuality. Lester's attempts to relive his youth are a direct result of his lust for Angela,<ref name=\"pennington 104\">{{harvnb|Pennington|2007|p=104}}</ref> and the state of his relationship with Carolyn is in part shown through their lack of sexual contact. Also sexually frustrated, Carolyn has an affair that takes her from \"cold perfectionist\" to more of a carefree soul who \"[sings] happily along with\" the music in her car.<ref name=\"pennington 105-106\"/> Jane and Angela constantly reference sex, through Angela's descriptions of her supposed sexual encounters and the way the girls address each other.<ref name=\"pennington 105-106\">{{harvnb|Pennington|2007|pp=105\u2013106}}</ref> Their nude scenes are used to communicate their vulnerability.<ref name=\"chapter 25\"/><ref name=\"chapter 18\"/> By the end of the film, Angela's hold on Jane has weakened until the only power she has over her friend is Lester's attraction to her.<ref name=\"chapter 23\">{{harvnb|Mendes|Ball|2000|loc=chapter 23}}</ref> Col. Fitts reacts with disgust to meeting Jim and Jim; he asks, \"How come these faggots always have to rub it in your face? How can they be so shameless?\" To which Ricky replies, \"That's the thing, Dad\u2014they don't feel like it's anything to be ashamed of.\" Pennington argues that Col. Fitts' reaction is not homophobic, but an \"anguished self-interrogation\".<ref name=\"pennington 106\">{{harvnb|Pennington|2007|p=106}}</ref>\n\nWith other turn-of-the-millennium films such as ''[[Fight Club]]'' (1999), ''[[In the Company of Men]]''&nbsp;(1997), ''[[American Psycho (film)|American Psycho]]''&nbsp;(2000), and ''[[Boys Don't Cry (1999 film)|Boys Don't Cry]]''&nbsp;(1999), ''American Beauty'' \"raises the broader, widely explored issue of masculinity in crisis\".<ref name=\"Hausmann 117\">{{harvnb|Hausmann|2004|p=117}}</ref> Professor Vincent Hausmann charges that in their reinforcement of masculinity \"against threats posed by war, by consumerism, and by feminist and queer challenges\", these films present a need to \"focus on, and even to privilege\" aspects of maleness \"deemed 'deviant{{'\"}}. Lester's transformation conveys \"that he, and not the woman, has borne the brunt of [lack of being]\"{{refn|According to Hausmann, \"These films appear to suggest that [the film theorist] [[Kaja Silverman]]'s wish 'that the typical male subject, like his female counterpart, might learn to live with lack'\u2014namely, the 'lack of being' that remains 'the irreducible condition of subjectivity'\u2014has not yet been fulfilled.\"<ref name=\"Hausmann 117\"/> See Silverman, Kaja (1992). ''Male Subjectivity at the Margins'' (New York: [[Routledge]]): 65+20. {{ISBN|9780415904193}}.|group=\"nb\"}} and he will not stand for being emasculated.<ref name=\"Hausmann 117\"/> Lester's attempts to \"strengthen traditional masculinity\" conflict with his responsibilities as a father.

Although the plot spans one year, the film is narrated by Lester at the moment of his death. Jacqueline Furby says that the plot \"occupies&nbsp;... no time [or] all time\", citing Lester's claim that life did not flash before his eyes, but that it \"stretches on forever like an ocean of time\".<ref name=\"Furby 2006 22\">{{harvnb|Furby|2006|p=22}}</ref> Furby argues that a \"rhythm of repetition\" forms the core of the film's structure.<ref>{{harvnb|Furby|2006|p=25}}</ref> For example, two scenes have the Burnhams sitting down to an evening meal, shot from the same angle. Each image is broadly similar, with minor differences in object placement and body language that reflect the changed dynamic brought on by Lester's new-found assertiveness.<ref>{{harvnb|Mendes|Ball|2000|loc=chapter 17}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Furby|2006|pp=25\u201326}}</ref> Another example is the pair of scenes in which Jane and Ricky film each other. Ricky films Jane from his bedroom window as she removes her bra, and the image is reversed later for a similarly \"voyeuristic and exhibitionist\" scene in which Jane films Ricky at a vulnerable moment.<ref name=\"Furby 2006 22\"/>\n\n[[File:American Beauty gymnasium.ogv|thumb|275px|alt=In a school gymnasium, a cheerleading squad dances in front of bleachers which host a crowd of parents; the camera follows one of the cheerleaders.

While the cheerleaders perform their half-time routine to \"[[On Broadway (song)|On Broadway]]\", Lester becomes increasingly fixated on Angela.

This [[diegesis|nondiegetic]] score is important to creating the narrative stasis in the sequence;<ref>{{harvnb|Link|2004|pp=84\u201385}}</ref> it conveys a moment for Lester that is stretched to an indeterminate length. The effect is one that Stan Link likens to \"vertical time\", described by the composer and music theorist [[Jonathan Kramer]] as music that imparts \"a single present stretched out into an enormous duration, a potentially infinite 'now' that nonetheless feels like an instant\".{{refn|Kramer uses the analogy of looking at a sculpture: \"We determine for ourselves the pacing of our experience: we are free to walk around the piece, view it from many angles, concentrate on some details, see other details in relationship to each other, step back and view the whole, see the relationship between the piece and the space in which we see it, leave the room when we wish close our eyes and remember, and return for further viewings.\"<ref name=\"link 86\"/>|group=\"nb\"}} The music is used like a visual cue, so that Lester and the score are staring at Angela. The sequence ends with the sudden reintroduction of \"On Broadway\" and [[teleology|teleological]] time.<ref name=\"link 86\">{{harvnb|Link|2004|p=86}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Drew Miller of ''[[Stylus Magazine|Stylus]]'', the soundtrack \"[gives] unconscious voice\" to the characters' psyches and complements the subtext. The most obvious use of pop music \"accompanies and gives context to\" Lester's attempts to recapture his youth; reminiscent of how the [[counterculture of the 1960s]] combated American repression through music and drugs, Lester begins to smoke cannabis and listen to rock music.{{refn|Another example comes with the songs that Carolyn picks to accompany the Burnhams' dinners\u2014upbeat \"[[elevator music]]\" which is later replaced with more discordant tunes that reflect the \"escalating tension\" at the table. When Jane plays \"[[Cancer for the Cure]]\", she switches off after a few moments because her parents return home. The moment reinforces her as someone whose voice is \"cut short\", as does her lack of association with as clearly defined genres as her parents.<ref name=\"miller\"/>|group=\"nb\"}} Mendes' song choices \"progress through the history of American popular music\". Miller argues that although some may be over familiar, there is a parodic element at work, \"making good on [the film's] encouragement that viewers look closer\". Toward the end of the film, [[Thomas Newman]]'s score features more prominently, creating \"a disturbing tempo\" that matches the tension of the visuals. The exception is \"[[Don't Let It Bring You Down]]\", which plays during Angela's seduction of Lester. At first appropriate, its tone clashes as the seduction stops. The lyrics, which speak of \"castles burning\", can be seen as a metaphor for Lester's view of Angela\u2014\"the rosy, fantasy-driven exterior of the 'American Beauty{{'\"}}\u2014as it burns away to reveal \"the timid, small-breasted girl who, like his wife, has willfully developed a false public self\".<ref name=\"miller\">{{Cite web|title=A Kiss After Supper: American Beauty|url=http://stylusmagazine.com/articles/a_kiss_after_supper/american-beauty.htm|last=Miller|first=Drew|date=2004-07-20|website=[[Stylus Magazine|Stylus]]|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100113232928/http://stylusmagazine.com/articles/a_kiss_after_supper/american-beauty.htm|archive-date=2010-01-13|access-date=2020-05-09}}</ref>\n\n==Production==\n\n===Development===\nBall began writing ''American Beauty'' as a play in the early 1990s, partly inspired by the media circus that accompanied the [[Amy Fisher]] trial in 1992.<ref name=\"kazan 25\" />  He shelved the play after deciding that the story would not work on stage.

The production deliberately minimized the use of red, as it was an important thematic signature elsewhere. The Burnhams' home uses cool blues, while the Fitts' is kept in a \"depressed military palette\".<ref name=\"shohan\"/>\n\nMendes' dominating visual style was deliberate and composed, with a minimalist design that provided \"a sparse, almost surreal feeling\u2014a bright, crisp, hard edged, near [[Ren\u00e9 Magritte|Magritte]]-like take on American suburbia\"; Mendes constantly directed his set dressers to empty the frame. He made Lester's fantasy scenes \"more fluid and graceful\",<ref name=\"kemp 26\"/> and Mendes made minimal use of [[steadicam]]s, feeling that stable shots generated more tension. For example, when Mendes used a slow push in to the Burnhams' dinner table, he held the shot because his training as a theater director taught him the importance of putting distance between the characters. He wanted to keep the tension in the scene, so he only cut away when Jane left the table.{{refn|The shot references a similar one in ''[[Ordinary People]]''&nbsp;(1980). Mendes included several such homages to other films; family photographs in the characters' homes were inserted to give them a sense of history, but also as a nod to the way [[Terrence Malick]] used still photographs in ''[[Badlands (film)|Badlands]]''&nbsp;(1973).<ref name=\"chapter 2\"/> A shot of Lester's jogging was a homage to ''[[Marathon Man (film)|Marathon Man]]''&nbsp;(1976) and Mendes watched several films to help improve his ability to evoke a \"heightened sense of style\": ''[[The King of Comedy (film)|The King of Comedy]]''&nbsp;(1983), ''[[All That Jazz (film)|All That Jazz]]''&nbsp;(1979) and ''[[Rosemary's Baby (film)|Rosemary's Baby]]''&nbsp;(1968).<ref>{{harvnb|Mendes|Ball|2000|loc=chapter 21}}</ref>|group=\"nb\"}}<ref name=\"chapter 2\"/> Mendes used a hand-held camera for the scene in which Col.

He also went hand-held for the excerpts of Ricky's camcorder footage.<ref name=\"chapter 18\">{{harvnb|Mendes|Ball|2000|loc=chapter 18}}</ref> Mendes took a long time to get the quality of Ricky's footage to the level he wanted.<ref name=\"chapter 2\"/> For the plastic-bag footage, Mendes used wind machines to move the bag in the air. The scene took four takes; two by the [[second unit]] did not satisfy Mendes, so he shot the scene himself. He felt his first take lacked grace, but for the last attempt, he changed the location to the front of a brick wall and added leaves on the ground. Mendes was satisfied by the way the wall gave definition to the outline of the bag.<ref>{{harvnb|Lowenstein|2008|p=268}}</ref>\n\nMendes avoided using [[close-up]]s, believing the technique was overused.

Mendes said, \"I wanted that not just because it was funny&nbsp;... but because I didn't want it to seem rehearsed. I wanted it to seem like he was blurting it out of his mouth without thinking.

Mendes and an assistant edited the film for ten days between the appointments.<ref>{{harvnb|Lowenstein|2008|p=270}}</ref> Mendes realized during editing that the film was different from the one he had envisioned. He believed he had been making a \"much more whimsical,&nbsp;... kaleidoscopic\" film than what came together in the edit suite. Instead, Mendes was drawn to the emotion and darkness; he began to use the score and shots he had intended to discard to craft the film along these lines.<ref name=\"kemp 25-26\">{{harvnb|Kemp|2000|pages=25\u201326}}</ref> In total, he cut about 30 minutes from his original edit.<ref name=\"chapter 19\"/> The opening included a dream in which Lester imagines himself flying above the town. Mendes spent two days filming Spacey against [[chroma key|bluescreen]], but removed the sequence as he believed it to be too whimsical\u2014\"like a [[Coen brothers]] movie\"\u2014and therefore inappropriate for the tone he was trying to set.<ref name=\"chapter 2\"/> The opening in the final cut reused a scene from the middle of the film where Jane tells Ricky to kill her father.<ref name=\"chapter 1\"/> This scene was to be the revelation to the audience that the pair was not responsible for Lester's death, as the way it was scored and acted made it clear that Jane's request was not serious. However, in the portion he used in the opening\u2014and when the full scene plays out later\u2014Mendes used the score and a reaction shot of Ricky to leave a lingering ambiguity as to his guilt.<ref>{{harvnb|Mendes|Ball|2000|loc=chapter 20}}</ref> The subsequent shot\u2014an aerial view of the neighborhood\u2014was originally intended as the plate shot for the bluescreen effects in the dream sequence.<ref name=\"chapter 2\"/>\n\nMendes spent more time recutting the first ten minutes than the rest of the film taken together. He trialed several versions of the opening;<ref name=\"chapter 1\"/> the first edit included bookend scenes in which Jane and Ricky are convicted of Lester's murder,<ref name=\"chapter 12\">{{harvnb|Mendes|Ball|2000|loc=chapter 12}}</ref> but Mendes excised these in the last week of editing<ref name=\"chapter 1\"/> because he felt they made the film lose its mystery,<ref>Staff (July 7, 2000). {{\"'}}Beauty' mark: DVD due with 3 hours of extras\". ''The Hollywood Reporter''.</ref> and because they did not fit with the theme of redemption that had emerged during production. Mendes believed the trial drew focus away from the characters and turned the film \"into an episode of ''[[NYPD Blue]]''\". Instead, he wanted the ending to be \"a poetic mixture of dream and memory and narrative resolution\".<ref name=\"kemp 26\">{{harvnb|Kemp|2000|p=26}}</ref> When Ball first saw a completed edit, it was a version with truncated versions of these scenes. He felt that they were so short that they \"didn't really register\".  Mendes and he argued,<ref name=\"kazan 35\"/> but Ball was more accepting after Mendes cut the sequences completely; Ball felt that without the scenes, the film was more optimistic and had evolved into something that \"for all its darkness had a really romantic heart\".<ref name=\"wolk\"/>\n\n===Cinematography===\n[[Conrad Hall]] was not the first choice for director of photography; Mendes believed he was \"too old and too experienced\" to want the job, and he had been told that Hall was difficult to work with. Instead, Mendes asked [[Frederick Elmes]], who turned the job down because he did not like the script.<ref name=\"lowenstein 259\">{{harvnb|Lowenstein|2008|p=259}}</ref> Hall was recommended to Mendes by [[Tom Cruise]], because of Hall's work on ''[[Without Limits]]''&nbsp;(1998), which Cruise had executive produced. Mendes was directing Cruise's then-wife [[Nicole Kidman]] in the play ''[[The Blue Room (play)|The Blue Room]]'' during preproduction on ''American Beauty'',<ref name=\"impeccable 75\"/> and had already [[storyboard]]ed the whole film.<ref name=\"fanshawe\"/> Hall was involved for one month during preproduction;<ref name=\"impeccable 75\"/> his ideas for lighting the film began with his first reading of the script, and further passes allowed him to refine his approach before meeting Mendes.<ref name=\"probst 80\">{{harvnb|Probst|2000|p=80}}</ref> Hall was initially concerned that audiences would not like the characters; he only felt able to identify with them during cast rehearsals, which gave him fresh ideas on his approach to the visuals.<ref name=\"impeccable 75\"/>\n\nHall's approach was to create peaceful compositions that evoked [[classicism]], to contrast with the turbulent on-screen events and allow audiences to take in the action. Hall and Mendes first discussed the intended mood of a scene, but he was allowed to light the shot in any way he felt necessary.<ref name=\"probst 80\"/> In most cases, Hall first lit the scene's subject by \"painting in\" the blacks and whites, before adding [[fill light]], which he reflected from [[rigid panel|beadboard]] or white card on the ceiling. This approach gave Hall more control over the shadows while keeping the fill light unobtrusive and the dark areas free of spill.<ref name=\"probst 81\"/> Hall shot ''American Beauty'' in a [[Aspect ratio (image)|2.39:1 aspect ratio]] in the [[Super 35]] format, primarily using [[List of motion picture film stocks#Vision color negative (ECN-2 process 1996\u20132002)|Kodak Vision 500T 5279]] [[35mm movie film|35&nbsp;mm film stock]].<ref name=\"impeccable 76\"/> He used Super 35 partly because its larger scope allowed him to capture elements such as the corners of the petal-filled pool in its overhead shot, creating a frame around Angela within.<ref name=\"chapter 5\"/> He shot the whole film at the same [[T-stops|T-stop]] (T1.9);<ref name=\"impeccable 76\">{{harvnb|Probst|Heuring|Holben|Thomson|2000|p=76}}</ref> given his preference for shooting that wide, Hall favored high-speed stocks to allow for more subtle lighting effects.<ref name=\"probst 81\"/> He used [[Panavision cameras|Panavision Platinum]] cameras with the company's Primo series of [[prime lens|prime]] and [[zoom lens]]es. Hall employed Kodak Vision 200T 5274 and [[List of motion picture film stocks#EXR color negative (ECN-2 process 1989\u20131996)|EXR 100T 5248]] stock for scenes with daylight effects. He had difficulty adjusting to Kodak's newly introduced Vision release print stock, which, combined with his contrast-heavy lighting style, created a look with too much contrast. Hall contacted Kodak, who sent him a batch of 5279 that was five percent lower in contrast. Hall used a 1/8th strength [[Tiffen (company)|Tiffen]] Black ProMist [[Photographic filter|filter]] for almost every scene, which he said in retrospect may not have been the best choice, as the optical steps required to blow Super 35 up for its [[anamorphic format|anamorphic]] release print led to a slight amount of degradation; therefore, the [[Photon diffusion|diffusion]] from the filter was not required. When he saw the film in a theater, Hall felt that the image was slightly unclear and that had he not used the filter, the diffusion from the Super 35\u2013anamorphic conversion would have generated an image closer to what he originally intended.<ref name=\"impeccable 76\"/>\n\nA shot where Lester and Ricky share a cannabis joint behind a building came from a misunderstanding between Hall and Mendes. Mendes asked Hall to prepare the shot in his absence; Hall assumed the characters would look for privacy, so he placed them in a narrow passage between a truck and the building, intending to light from the top of the truck. When Mendes returned, he explained that the characters did not care if they were seen. He removed the truck and Hall had to rethink the lighting; he lit it from the left, with a large light crossing the actors, and with a soft light behind the camera. Hall felt the consequent wide shot \"worked perfectly for the tone of the scene\".<ref name=\"impeccable 76\"/> Hall made sure to keep rain, or the suggestion of it, in every shot near the end of the film. In one shot during Lester's encounter with Angela at the Burnhams' home, Hall created rain effects on the foreground cross lights; in another, he partly lit the pair through French windows to which he had added material to make the rain run slower, intensifying the light (although the strength of the outside light was unrealistic for a night scene, Hall felt it justified because of the strong contrasts it produced). For the close-ups when Lester and Angela move to the couch, Hall tried to keep rain in the frame, lighting through the window onto the ceiling behind Lester.<ref name=\"probst 81\">{{harvnb|Probst|2000|p=81}}</ref> He also used rain boxes to produce rain patterns where he wanted without lighting the entire room.<ref name=\"probst 82\">{{harvnb|Probst|2000|p=82}}</ref>\n\n===Music===\n{{further|American Beauty (soundtrack)|American Beauty: Original Motion Picture Score}}\n[[Thomas Newman]]'s score was recorded in [[Santa Monica, California]].<ref name=\"weinraub\"/> He used mainly percussion instruments to create the mood and rhythm, the inspiration for which was provided by Mendes.<ref name=\"burlingame\"/> Newman \"favored pulse, rhythm, and color over melody\", making for a more minimalist score than he had previously created.

He said that Mendes worked the script's intricacies smoothly, to the ensemble's strengths, and staged the tonal shifts skillfully.<ref name=\"jackson\"/> McCarthy believed ''American Beauty'' a \"stunning card of introduction\" for film d\u00e9butantes Mendes and Ball. He said Mendes' \"sure hand\" was \"as precise and controlled\" as his theater work. McCarthy described Hall's involvement as fortunate for Mendes, as the cinematographer was \"unsurpassed\" at conveying the themes of a work.<ref name=\"mccarthy\"/> Turan agreed that Mendes' choice of collaborators was \"shrewd\", naming Hall and Newman in particular. Turan suggested that ''American Beauty'' may have benefited from Mendes' inexperience, as his \"anything's possible daring\" made him attempt beats that more seasoned directors might have avoided. Turan felt that Mendes' accomplishment was to \"capture and enhance [the] duality\" of Ball's script\u2014the simultaneously \"caricatured&nbsp;... and painfully real\" characters.<ref name=\"turan\"/> Hentzi, while critical of many of Mendes and Ball's choices, admitted the film showed off their \"considerable talents\".<ref name=\"hentzi 50\"/>\n\nTuran felt Ball's lack of constraint when writing the film was the reason for its uniqueness, in particular the script's subtle changes in tone.<ref name=\"turan\"/> McCarthy said the script was \"as fresh and distinctive\" as any of its American film contemporaries, and praised how it analyzed the characters while not compromising narrative pace. He called Ball's dialogue \"tart\" and said the characters\u2014Carolyn excepted\u2014were \"deeply drawn\". One other flaw, McCarthy said, was the revelation of Col.

Nevertheless, Hentzi believed that the film's themes of materialism and conformity in American suburbia were \"hackneyed\".<ref name=\"hentzi 46\"/> McCarthy conceded that the setting was familiar, but said it merely provided the film with a \"starting point\" from which to tell its \"subtle and acutely judged tale\".<ref name=\"mccarthy\"/> Maslin agreed; she said that while it \"takes aim at targets that are none too fresh\", and that the theme of nonconformity did not surprise, the film had its own \"corrosive novelty\".\n\n===Retrospective===\nA few months after the film's release, reports of a backlash appeared in the American press,<ref name=\"backlash\"/> and the years since have seen its critical regard wane in [[post-9/11]] society and after Spacey's sexual allegations.<ref>{{cite news|first=Joel|last=Brown|date=June 22, 2001|title=The Tube Has Few Intriguing Choices to Offer|newspaper=[[The Tuscaloosa News]]|page=14}}</ref><ref name=\"lowenstein 271-272\">{{harvnb|Lowenstein|2008|pages=271\u2013272}}</ref> In 2005, ''[[Premiere (magazine)|Premiere]]'' named ''American Beauty'' as one of 20 \"most overrated movies of all time.\"<ref>{{cite magazine|date=September 2005|title=The 20 most overrated movies of all time|magazine=[[Premiere (magazine)|Premiere]]|volume=19|issue=1|pages=103\u2013108}}</ref> Mendes accepted the inevitability of the critical reappraisal, saying in 2008, \"I thought some of it was entirely justified\u2014it was a little overpraised at the time.\"<ref name=\"lowenstein 271-272\"/>\n\nIn 2019, on the occasion of the twentieth anniversary of the film's release, ''[[The Huffington Post]]''{{'}}s Matthew Jacobs wrote that \"the film's reputation has tumbled precipitously,\" adding, \"Plenty of classics undergo cultural reappraisals [...] but few have turned into such a widespread punchline.\"<ref name=\"HuffPost 20th anniversary story\"/>\n\n===In popular culture===\nThe film was spoofed by the [[animated sitcom]] ''[[Family Guy]]'',<ref>[https://www.huffpost.com/entry/american-beauty-legacy-20-years-later_n_5d5c344fe4b0d1e1136902be The Steady Cultural Demise Of 'American Beauty'|HuffPost Entertainment]</ref> the [[Todd Solondz]] film ''[[Storytelling (film)|Storytelling]]'', the teen movie spoof ''[[Not Another Teen Movie]]'', and in the [[DreamWorks Animation|DreamWorks animated film]] ''[[Madagascar (2005 film)|Madagascar]]''.<ref>[https://www.ign.com/articles/2005/12/08/madagascar Madagascar - IGN]</ref>\n\n==Accolades==\n{{main|List of accolades received by American Beauty}}\n''American Beauty'' was not considered an immediate favorite to dominate the American awards season.

Its campaign combined traditional advertising and publicity with more focused strategies. Although [[advertising mail|direct mail]] campaigning was prohibited, DreamWorks reached voters by promoting the film in \"casual, comfortable settings\" in voters' communities. The studio's candidate for [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]] the previous year, ''[[Saving Private Ryan]]'', lost to ''[[Shakespeare in Love]]'', so the studio took a new approach by hiring outsiders to provide input for the campaign. It hired three veteran consultants, who told the studio to \"think small\". Nancy Willen encouraged DreamWorks to produce a special about the making of ''American Beauty'', to set up displays of the film in the communities' bookstores, and to arrange a question-and-answer session with Mendes for the [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts]]. [[Dale Olson]] advised the studio to advertise in free publications that circulated in [[Beverly Hills]]\u2014home to many voters\u2014in addition to major newspapers. Olson arranged to screen ''American Beauty'' to about 1,000 members of the Actors Fund of America, as many participating actors were also voters. Bruce Feldman took writer Alan Ball to the [[Santa Barbara International Film Festival]], where Ball attended a private dinner in honor of [[Anthony Hopkins]], meeting several voters who were in attendance.<ref>Wallace, Amy (March 28, 2000). \"Aggressive campaign may have helped 'Beauty's' win\".
