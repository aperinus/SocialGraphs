G. Wells' The Time Machine''''') is a 1960 American [[period film|period]] [[science fiction film]] based on the 1895 [[The Time Machine|novella of the same name]] by [[H. G. Wells]]. It was produced and directed by [[George Pal]], and stars [[Rod Taylor]], [[Yvette Mimieux]], and [[Alan Young]]. The story is set in [[Victorian England]] and follows an inventor who constructs a machine that enables him to travel into the distant future. Once there, he discovers that mankind's descendants have [[speciation|divided into two species]], the passive, childlike, and [[vegetarian]] Eloi and the underground-dwelling Morlocks, who feed on the Eloi.\n\nThe film was originally released on August 17, 1960, and was distributed by [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://catalog.afi.com/Catalog/moviedetails/53322#3 |title=The Time Machine - Details |website=AFI Catalog of Feature Films |access-date=July 6, 2018 |archive-date=May 23, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180523101202/https://catalog.afi.com/Catalog/moviedetails/53322#3 |url-status=live }}</ref> It received the [[Academy Award for Best Visual Effects|Academy Award for Best Special Effects]]<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/1961 |title=The 33rd Academy Awards |publisher=[[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] |access-date=2019-07-16 |archive-date=2018-09-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180914193700/http://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/1961 |url-status=live }}</ref> for its [[time-lapse]] photographic effects, which show the world changing rapidly as the time traveler journeys into the future.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for featured film articles should be between 400-700 words. -->\nOn January 5, 1900, four friends arrive for a dinner at the [[London]] home of their inventor friend George. He is absent, then suddenly appears, bedraggled and exhausted. He recounts what happened to him.\n\nAt the group's earlier dinner on [[New Year's Eve]], George says time is \"the fourth dimension\". He shows David Filby, Dr. Philip Hillyer, Anthony Bridewell, and Walter Kemp a scale model time machine. When a tiny lever on it is pressed, the device disappears. George says it went forward in time, but his friends are doubtful. The groups leaves George's house, Filby reluctantly, as he senses George is not himself. Shortly thereafter, George retires to his private laboratory which holds a full-size time machine.\n\nGeorge travels forward in the machine, first in small increments and then to 1917. He meets Filby's son, James, who says Filby died in a [[World War I|war]]. George returns to the time machine and stops in 1940 during [[the Blitz]], finding himself in the midst of \"[[World War II|a new war]]\". A disillusioned George then travels to 1966. People are rushing to [[fallout shelter]]s as [[Civil defense siren|air raid sirens]] are blaring. An elderly James Filby urges George to take cover. George barely makes it back to his time machine as an \"atomic satellite\" detonates, causing a [[Volcano|volcanic eruption]]. The approaching lava rises, cools, and hardens, trapping George as he travels far into the future. Eventually the lava wears away, revealing a lush, unspoiled landscape.\n\nGeorge stops at October 12, 802,701, near the base of a [[sphinx]]. He encounters young men and women wearing simple clothing gathered at a stream. One woman, carried off by the current, screams for help. When her indifferent companions do nothing, George rescues her. The girl is [[Weena (The Time Machine)|Weena]] and her people are the [[Eloi]]; they do not operate machines, work, or read, and know little of their history. Their food is always provided for them.  One young male shows George a library, but the books crumble to dust when touched. Outraged, he decides to leave, but his machine has been dragged into the closed sphinx. Weena, who stays with him, says that [[Morlock]]s are responsible and they only come out at night. A hideous-looking Morlock jumps out and tries to drag Weena away, but is warded off by George's torch fire.\n\nThe next day, Weena shows George domed structures dotting the landscape: air shafts lead down to the Morlocks' caverns. Weena then shows George an ancient museum where \"talking rings\" tell of long-ago war between east and west that lasted 326 years and contaminated the atmosphere. Another ring describes humanity's struggle for survival; many lived [[Underground living|underground]], while some eventually returned to the surface. George realizes this was the beginning of the [[speciation]] that resulted in the Morlocks and Eloi. He starts to climb down a shaft, but stops when sirens emerge and blare from the sphinx. The Eloi go into a trance-like state and head for the opened doors at the sphinx's base. The sirens stop and the doors close, trapping Weena and others inside, while those outside merely walk away.\n\nGeorge enters the caverns through the air shafts. He discovers that the Morlocks raise the Eloi as food. He finds Weena and fights off the creatures, finally inspiring the Eloi to defend themselves. George sets fires and urges the Eloi to climb to the surface. He directs them to drop tree branches down the shafts. The resulting fires cause the caverns to collapse.\n\nThe next morning, the sphinx's doors are open. George's time machine is inside. Upon his entering, the doors close, and George is attacked by Morlocks. He escapes in his machine and returns to 1900.\n\nAfter George recounts his story, his friends remain skeptical. He produces a flower Weena gave him, and Filby, an amateur [[botany|botanist]], identifies it as an unknown species. George bids his guests good evening. Filby returns shortly after to find George and his time machine gone. His housekeeper, Mrs. Watchett, notes that nothing is missing except three books that she is unable to identify. When Mrs. Watchett wonders if George will ever return, Filby knowingly remarks that \"he has all the time in the world\".\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Rod Taylor]] as H.

Unable to sell Hollywood on the concept of the film, he found MGM's British studio (where he had filmed ''[[Tom Thumb (film)|Tom Thumb]]'') open to his proposal.{{Citation needed|date=February 2016}}\n\nThe name of the film's main character (alluded to in dialogue only as \"George\") connects him both with George Pal and with the story's original science fiction writer H. G. (George) Wells. The name \"H. George Wells\" can be seen on a brass plaque on the time machine.<ref name=\"hughes\">{{cite book |first=Howard |last=Hughes |title=Outer Limits: The Filmgoers' Guide to the Great Science-Fiction Films |publisher=I.B.

He later changed his mind and selected the younger Australian actor [[Rod Taylor]] to give the character a more athletic, idealistic dimension.

Live-action scenes were filmed from May 25 to June 30, 1959, in [[Culver City, California]], with the backgrounds often filled in by virtue of [[matte painting]]s & models.{{Citation needed|date=February 2016}} Some of the costumes and set were re-used from ''[[Forbidden Planet]]'' (1956) such as the Civil Defence air raid officer uniform which was the [[C-57D|C-57-D]] crew uniform and the large acrylic sphere in the talking rings room, a prop from the C-57-D's control bridge.\n\n==Home media releases==\nReleased multiple times on [[Betamax|Beta]] and [[VHS]] video cassette, [[Capacitance Electronic Disc]] (CED), and both [[Letterboxing (filming)|letterboxed]] and [[open matte]] [[LaserDisc]], the film was released on [[DVD]] in October 2000 and on [[Blu-ray Disc]] in July 2014 from [[Warner Home Video]].\n\n==Soundtrack==\nAn original film score [[compact disc|CD]] was released in 1987 produced by [[Arnold Leibovit]], the original soundtrack recording was composed and conducted by [[Russell Garcia (composer)|Russell Garcia]] himself.

[[Bosley Crowther]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote a mixed review, praising the \"familiar polish and burnish\" of the production values but finding that \"the drama, for all its invention, is creaky and a bit pass\u00e9. (Apparently there has still been no contact with other planets in 800,000 A.D.) And the mood, while delicately wistful, is not so flippant or droll as it might be in a fiction as fanciful and flighty as this one naturally is\".<ref>{{cite journal |last=Crowther |first=Bosley |date=August 18, 1960 |title=Screen: Glimpse of Life in 800,000 A.D. |journal=[[The New York Times]] |page=19 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1960/08/18/archives/screen-glimpse-of-life-in-800000-adthe-time-machine-opens-at-warner.html |access-date=September 12, 2019 |archive-date=September 4, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200904081615/https://www.nytimes.com/1960/08/18/archives/screen-glimpse-of-life-in-800000-adthe-time-machine-opens-at-warner.html |url-status=live }}</ref> A generally positive review in ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' praised the special effects as \"fascinating\" and wrote that \"Rod Taylor definitely establishes himself as one of the premium young talents on today's screen\", but faulted the pacing of the film, finding that \"things slow down to a walk\" once the protagonist arrives in the far distant future.<ref>{{cite journal |date=July 20, 1960 |title=The Time Machine |journal=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |page=6 }}</ref> ''[[Harrison's Reports]]'' called the film \"an excellent science-fiction melodrama ... jammed full of suspense, action and out-of-this-world special effects\", although the review lamented a lack of comic relief.<ref>{{cite journal |date=July 23, 1960 |title='The Time Machine' with Rod Taylor, Alan Young, Yvette Mimieux and Sebastian Cabot |journal=[[Harrison's Reports]] |page=118 }}</ref> [[Whitney Balliett]] of ''[[The New Yorker]]'' wrote in a negative review that the film \"converts this good simple-minded material into bad simple-minded material\", by including such Hollywood touches as a love interest.
