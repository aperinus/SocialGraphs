The film is about the struggles of independent game developers [[Edmund McMillen]] and [[Tommy Refenes]] during the development of ''[[Super Meat Boy]]'', [[Phil Fish]] during the development of ''[[Fez (video game)|Fez]]'', and also [[Jonathan Blow]], who reflects on the success of ''[[Braid (video game)|Braid]]''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Indie Game: The Movie About|url=http://www.indiegamethemovie.com/about/|access-date=17 April 2012|work=Indiegamethemovie.com}}</ref>\n\nAfter two successful [[Kickstarter]] funds,<ref>{{cite web | url= http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/blinkworks/indie-game-the-movie| title= Indie Game: The Movie by BlinkWorks| date = 20 July 2010| publisher= Kickstarter| access-date = 9 August 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url= http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/blinkworks/indie-game-the-movie-the-final-push| title= Indie Game: The Movie - The Final Push by BlinkWorks| date= 23 July 2011| publisher= Kickstarter| access-date= 9 August 2015}}</ref> interviews were conducted with prominent indie developers within the community.

He also talks about the aftermath of the game: When ''Braid'' comes out, it receives widespread critical acclaim, but Blow is disillusioned, when a large portion of players don't \"get\" the underlying message and themes of the game. He makes attempts to influence the audience's impression of the game through forum posts and blog comments, but this eventually turns him into something of a comic figure, which he feels uncomfortable with. The game remains a commercial and critical success.\n\n''Super Meat Boy'' developers Team Meat ([[Edmund McMillen]] and [[Tommy Refenes]]) set out to do a platform game that harkens back to their own childhood video game experiences. McMillen talks about his lifelong goal of communicating to others through his work. He goes on to talk about his 2008 game ''[[Aether (video game)|Aether]]'' that chronicles his childhood feelings of loneliness, nervousness, and fear of abandonment. He also sheds light on the level design techniques he uses, on how he teaches players to play without extensive tutorials.\n\nAbout a year into development, Microsoft offers Team Meat a chance to take part in an [[Xbox Live Arcade]] promotion called \"Game Feast\", under the condition that they finish the game in a month, which they reluctantly accept because of their dire financial situation. The development goes into [[wikt:crunch time|crunch time]], and takes its toll on McMillen's marriage, and on the health of Refenes, who bears the brunt of the work. Refenes also laments how he sacrificed his social life to get the game done, but expresses gratitude for his family being supportive of his goal. The team successfully delivers the game, but come release day, the game is nowhere to be found on Xbox Live, which greatly upsets Refenes, who predicts low sales as a result. The game does eventually appear on the marketplace, and doubles ''Braid''{{'}}s sales, selling 20,000 units in the first 24 hours. McMillen is surprised by both the sales and touched by the fan reaction, and although Refenes, exhausted and cynical, is less enthusiastic, his joy shows through when he sees videos of people enjoying the game. The game eventually goes on to sell a million copies, providing a level of financial security to both developers.\n\n''Fez'' developer Polytron ([[Phil Fish]] and [[Renaud B\u00e9dard]]) is in the fourth year of the game's development: the game was first announced at [[Independent Games Festival|Independent Games Festival 2008]], which thrust Fish into the limelight as an \"indie developer celebrity\", but little was heard of the game since. The development is troubled casting doubt on the future of the project. Fish himself admits to his perfectionism protracting the development, as well as losing perspective over time about how good the game really is. Similar to Refenes, Fish also notes that he does not see himself doing anything else other than indie games, saying that ''Fez'' has become his identity over time.\n\nPolytron prepares to present ''Fez'' at [[Penny Arcade Expo]], despite the possibility of a lawsuit lingering: Fish's original business partner (Jason DeGroot,<ref name=\"Destructoid DeGroot\">{{cite web | url=http://www.destructoid.com/indie-game-the-movie-s-new-credits-put-end-to-conflict-229538.phtml |title=Indie Game: The Movie's new credits put end to conflict |date=14 June 2012 |publisher=Destructoid |access-date=2013-08-17}}</ref><ref name=\"Phil Fish DigitalTrends\">{{cite web |url=https://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/goodbye-phil-fish-we-hardly-knew-ye/ |first=Michael |last=Rougeau |date=July 30, 2013 |publisher=[[Digital Trends]] |title=The rise, and completely predictable fall of game developer Phil Fish}}</ref> who does not participate in the film) is yet to sign his side of a final separation deal, and as such, he could potentially block Polytron from presenting at PAX. This causes Fish to suffer anxiety attacks over the course of the preparation. The ''Fez'' kiosk is set up nevertheless, but the show runs into problems, when last minute changes in the build cause the game to often hang up or crash, forcing Fish to occasionally restart the game. The players are unfazed and continue to enjoy the game nevertheless; Fish gives a number of interviews, and [[Jerry Holkins]] expresses his excitement about the product as well. Towards the closing of the show, Fish's new partner Ken Schachter announces that he and the former business partner had a meeting and have come to an agreement, which relieves Fish, who in the end is satisfied with the results of the show, and vows to continue working on the game and releasing it in 2012 (which would ultimately occur).\n\nThe film bookends itself with Jonathan Blow's opening monologue about how indie gaming differs by offering flaws and vulnerabilities, making the games more personal. During the [[closing credits]], videos of other upcoming indie games are interspersed.\n\n==Reception==\n[[File:Indie Game The Movie directors Lisanne Pajot and James Swirsky at the 2012 XOXO Festival (7991638723).jpg|thumb|Directors Lisanne Pajot and James Swirsky, 2012]] \n''Indie Game: The Movie'' received a high level of interest from the gaming community almost from its inception.<ref>{{cite news| title=Indie Game: The Movie Trailer Likely to Make You Tear Up| url=http://www.giantbomb.com/news/indie-game-the-movie-trailer-likely-to-make-you-tear-up/3405/|work=[[Giant Bomb]]|last=Klepeck|first=Patrick|date=21 June 2011|access-date=9 August 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| title=Check out ''Indie Game: The Movie''| url=http://uk.ign.com/articles/2011/08/08/check-out-indie-game-the-movie|work=[[IGN]]|date=8 August 2011|access-date=9 August 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Support, Money Wanted For Spectacular Looking ''Indie Game: The Movie''|url=http://www.g4tv.com/thefeed/blog/post/704781/support-money-wanted-for-spectacular-looking-indie-game-the-movie/|access-date=9 August 2015|work=G4 TV|date=18 May 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=McElroy|first1=Griffin|title=Be a big Hollywood producer by funding Indie Game: The Movie|url=https://www.engadget.com/2010/05/19/be-a-big-hollywood-producer-by-funding-indie-game-the-movie/|access-date=9 August 2015|work=Engadget|date=19 May 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Devore|first1=Jordan|title=Indie Game: The Movie bound for Sundance|url=http://www.destructoid.com/indie-game-the-movie-bound-for-sundance-217041.phtml|access-date=9 August 2015|work=Destructoid|date=12 January 2011}}</ref> [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reports 93% approval based on reviews from 26 critics, with an average rating of 7.7/10.<ref>{{cite web|title=Indie Game: The Movie (2012)|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/indie_game_the_movie_2012/|website=Rotten Tomatoes|access-date=9 August 2015}}</ref> The film also holds a 73/100 average on [[Metacritic]].<ref>{{Citation|title=Indie Game: The Movie|url=https://www.metacritic.com/movie/indie-game-the-movie|access-date=2019-11-09}}</ref> [[G4 (U.S. TV channel)|G4 TV]] praised the film saying \"''Indie Game: The Movie'' is definitely worth your time, and should be seen by everyone in the video game industry on the publisher, developer, and consumer sides.\"<ref>{{cite web|last1=Kelly|first1=Kevin|title=Indie Game: The Movie - The Review|url=http://www.g4tv.com/thefeed/blog/post/720442/indie-game-the-movie-the-review/|website=G4 TV|access-date=9 August 2015|date=2 February 2012}}</ref> [[Ain't It Cool News]] echoed these statements, stating that \"there are victories, defeats, tears and smiles.
