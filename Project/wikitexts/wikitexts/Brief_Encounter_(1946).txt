The protagonist is Laura, a married woman with children, whose conventional life becomes increasingly complicated after a chance meeting at a railway station with a married stranger with whom she subsequently falls in love.\n\nThe film premiered in London on 13 November 1945, and was theatrically released on 25 November to widespread critical acclaim. It received three nominations at the [[19th Academy Awards]], [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]], [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]] (for Johnson), and [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Adapted Screenplay]].\n\nMany critics, historians, and scholars cite the film as [[List of films considered the best|one of the greatest of all time]]. In 1999, the [[British Film Institute]] ranked it as the [[BFI Top 100 British films|second-greatest British film of all time]]. In 2017, a ''[[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out]]'' poll of 150 actors, directors, writers, producers, and critics ranked it the 12th-best British film ever.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://www.timeout.com/london/film/100-best-british-films#tab_panel_4 |title=The 100 best British films |first=Tom |last=Huddleston |magazine=[[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out]] |access-date=24 October 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nLaura Jesson, a respectable middle-class British woman in an affectionate but rather dull marriage, tells her story while sitting at home with her husband, imagining that she is confessing her affair to him.\n\nLike many women of her class at the time, Laura visits a nearby town every Thursday for shopping and a matin\u00e9e movie. Returning from one such excursion to Milford, while waiting in the railway station's [[Railway refreshment room|refreshment room]], she is helped by another passenger, who solicitously removes a piece of grit from her eye. The man is Alec Harvey, an idealistic [[general practitioner]] who also works Thursdays as a consultant at the local hospital. Both are in their late thirties or early forties, married, and with children (although Alec's wife Madeleine and their two sons are unseen).\n\n[[File:BriefEncounter-TrainWindow.jpg|thumb|250px|left|[[Celia Johnson]] and [[Trevor Howard]]]]\nThe two accidentally meet again outside [[Boots UK|Boots the Chemist]], and then on a third meeting share a table at lunch, then, both having free time, go to an afternoon performance at the Palladium Cinema. They are soon troubled to find their innocent and casual relationship developing into something deeper, approaching infidelity.\n\nThey meet openly until they run into friends of Laura's and the perceived need to deceive others arises. The second lie comes more easily. They eventually go to a flat belonging to Stephen, a friend of Alec's and a fellow doctor, but are interrupted by Stephen's unexpected and judgmental return. Humiliated and ashamed, Laura runs down the back stairs and into the streets. She walks and walks, and sits on a bench for hours, smoking, until a concerned policeman encourages her to get out of the cold. She arrives at the station just in time for the last train home.\n\nThe recent turn of events makes the couple realise that an affair or a future together is impossible. Understanding the temptation and not wishing to hurt their families, they agree to part. Alec has been offered a job in [[Johannesburg]], South Africa, where his brother lives.\n\nTheir final meeting occurs in the railway station refreshment room, now seen for a second time with the poignant perspective of their story. As they await a heart-rending final parting, Dolly Messiter, a talkative acquaintance of Laura's, invites herself to join them and begins chattering away, oblivious to the couple's misery.\n\nAs they realise that they have lost their chance for a final goodbye, Alec's train arrives. With Dolly still chattering, Alec departs without the passionate farewell for which they both long. After shaking Dolly's hand, he discreetly squeezes Laura on the shoulder and leaves. Laura waits for a moment, anxiously hoping that Alec will walk back into the refreshment room, but he does not. As the train is heard pulling away, Laura is galvanised by emotion, and, hearing an approaching express train, dashes out to the platform. The train's lights flash across her face as she conquers a [[suicide methods#Rail|suicidal]] impulse. She then returns home to her family.\n\nLaura's kind and patient husband, Fred, shows that he has noticed her distance, though whether he has guessed the reason is not clear. He thanks her for coming back to him. She cries in his embrace.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Celia Johnson]] as Laura Jesson\n* [[Trevor Howard]] as Dr Alec Harvey\n* [[Stanley Holloway]] as Albert Godby, the ticket inspector\n* [[Joyce Carey]] as Myrtle Bagot, the cafe owner\n* [[Cyril Raymond]] as Fred Jesson\n* [[Everley Gregg]] as Dolly Messiter\n* [[Margaret Barton]] as Beryl Walters, tea-room assistant\n* Marjorie Mars as Mary Norton\n* [[Alfie Bass]] (''uncredited'') as the waiter at the Royal\n* [[Wallace Bosco]] (''uncredited'') as the doctor at Bobbie's accident\n* [[Sydney Bromley]] (''uncredited'') as Johnnie, second soldier\n* [[No\u00ebl Coward]] (''uncredited'') as the railway station announcer\n* Nuna Davey (''uncredited'') as Herminie Rolandson, Mary's cousin\n* [[Valentine Dyall]] (''uncredited'') as Stephen Lynn, Alec's friend\n* [[Irene Handl]] (''uncredited'') as cellist and organist\n* [[Richard Martin (British director)|Richard Thomas]] (''uncredited'') as Bobby Jesson, Fred and Laura's son\n* Henrietta Vincent (''uncredited'') as Margaret Jesson, Fred and Laura's daughter\n}}\n\n==Adaptation==\n{{main|Still Life (play)}}\n\n===''Still Life''===\nThe film is based on [[No\u00ebl Coward]]'s [[one-act play]] ''[[Still Life (play)|Still Life]]'' (1936), one of ten short plays in the cycle ''[[Tonight at 8.30]]'', designed for [[Gertrude Lawrence]] and Coward himself, and to be performed in various combinations as triple bills. All scenes in ''Still Life'' are set in the refreshment room of a railway station (the fictional Milford Junction).\n\nAs is common in films based on stage plays, the film depicts only places mentioned in the play: Dr. Lynn's [[Apartment|flat]], Laura's home, a [[Movie theatre|cinema]], a restaurant and a branch of [[Boots the Chemist]]. There are also several scenes that are not in the play: a scene on a lake in a rowing boat where Dr Harvey gets his feet wet; Laura wandering alone in the dark, sitting down on a park bench, smoking in public and being confronted by a police officer; and a drive in the country in a hired car.\n\nSome scenes are made less ambiguous and more dramatic in the film. The scene in which the two lovers are about to commit [[adultery]] is toned down: in the play it is left for the audience to decide whether they actually [[consummate]] their relationship; in the film it seems that they do not. In the film, Laura has only just arrived at Dr Lynn's flat when the owner returns and is immediately led out by Dr Harvey via the kitchen service door. Later, when Laura seems to want to throw herself in front of an express train, the film makes the intention clearer by means of [[voice-over]] narration.\n\nAlso, in the play, the characters at the Milford station\u2014Mrs Baggot, Mr Godby, Beryl and Stanley\u2014are very much aware of the growing relationship between Laura and Alec, and sometimes mention it in an offhand manner; in the film, they take barely any notice of them or what they are doing. The final scene of the film, showing Laura embracing her husband after he shows that he has noticed her distance in the past few weeks and perhaps even guessed the reason, is not in the original Coward play.\n\nThere are two editions of Coward's original screenplay for the film adaptation, both listed in the bibliography.\n\n==Production==\nMuch of the film version was shot at [[Carnforth railway station]] in Lancashire, then a junction on the [[London, Midland and Scottish Railway]]. While a busy station, it was far enough away from major cities to avoid the [[Blackout (wartime)|blackout]] for film purposes, shooting taking place in early 1945 before [[World War II]] had ended. At two points in the film, the station location is indicated by platform signs referring to local destinations including [[Leeds]], [[Bradford]], [[Morecambe]] and [[Lancaster, Lancashire|Lancaster]]. Coward makes the station announcements in the film. The station refreshment room was a studio recreation. [[Carnforth]] Station still retains many of the period features present at the time of filming and remains a place of pilgrimage for fans of the film.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/cumbria/features/cumbria_on_film/brief_encounter.shtml |title=Cumbria on Film \u2013 Brief Encounter (1945) |date=28 October 2014 |website=BBC |access-date=10 March 2016}}</ref> Some of the urban scenes were shot in London, [[Denham, Buckinghamshire|Denham]], and [[Beaconsfield]], near [[Denham Film Studios|Denham Studios]], where the film was made.<ref>{{cite book |last=Whitaker |first=Brian |title=Notes & Queries |publisher=Fourth Estate |year=1990 |isbn=1-872180-22-1 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/notesqueries01whit}}</ref>\n\nThe country bridge the lovers visit twice (including on their final day) is Middle Fell Bridge at [[Dungeon Ghyll]] in [[Cumbria]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.waymarking.com/waymarks/WM9HRH_Brief_Encounter_Middle_Fell_Bridge_Dungeon_Ghyll_Cumbria_UK |title=Brief Encounter, Middle Fell Bridge, Dungeon Ghyll, Cumbria, UK |website=Waymarking.com |access-date=30 October 2021}}</ref>\n\nThe poem that Fred asks Laura to assist him with for his [[crossword]] is by [[John Keats]]: \"[[When I have Fears that I may Cease to Be]]\". The quote Fred recites is \"When I behold, upon the night's starr'd face, huge cloudy symbols of a high romance\".\n\nIn addition to the Keats reference, there is a visual reference to an Arabic love poem.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} In Dr Lynn's apartment, a wall hanging is prominently displayed twice.

In 2004, the magazine ''[[Total Film]]'' named it the 44th greatest British film of all time. [[Derek Malcolm]] included the film in his 2000 column ''The Century of Films''. The British historian Thomas Dixon notes that ''Brief Encounter'' \"has become a classic example of a very modern and very British phenomenon\u2014weeping over the [[stiff upper lip]], crying at people not crying. The audiences for these wartime weepies could, through their own tears, provide something that was lacking in their own lives as well as those of the on-screen stoics they admired.\"<ref>{{cite book |last=Dixon |first=Thomas |title=Weeping Britannia: Portrait of a Nation in Tears |location=Oxford, UK |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2015 |isbn=978-0-19-967605-7}}</ref>\n\nThe British play and film ''[[The History Boys]]'' features two of the main characters reciting a passage of the film. (The scene portrayed, with Posner as Johnson and Scripps as Raymond, is in the closing minutes of the film where Laura begins, \"I really meant to do it.\")\n\nDirector [[Robert Altman]]'s wife Kathryn Altman said, \"One day, years and years ago, just after the war, [Altman] had nothing to do and he went to a theater in the middle of the afternoon to see a movie. Not a Hollywood movie: a British movie. He said the main character was not glamorous, not a babe. And at first he wondered why he was even watching it. But twenty minutes later he was in tears, and had fallen in love with her. And it made him feel that it wasn't just a movie.\" The film was ''Brief Encounter''.<ref>A quote from the final scene in the 2014 documentary ''[[Altman (film)|Altman]]''.</ref>\n\nThe episode \"Grief Encounter\" of the British comedy series ''Goodnight Sweetheart'' features the Coward character and shooting a similar scene in Milford railway station. ''[[Mum's Army]]'', an episode of ''Dad's Army'', also seems loosely inspired by ''Brief Encounter''.\n\n''Brief Encounter'' serves as a plot device in ''[[Mrs. Palfrey at the Claremont]]'', a 2005 comedy-drama film based on [[Mrs. Palfrey at the Claremont (novel)|the 1971 novel]] by [[Elizabeth Taylor (novelist)|Elizabeth Taylor]]. The aging widow Mrs. Palfrey reminisces that ''Brief Encounter'' was her and her deceased husband's favorite film, which leads her young friend, the writer Ludovic Meyer, to meet and bond with his eventual girlfriend.\n\nIn the 2012 ''[[Sight & Sound]]'' polls of the world's greatest films, ''Brief Encounter'' received the votes of 11 critics and three directors.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b6a66b375/sightandsoundpoll2012 |title=Votes for Brief Encounter (1946) |website=[[British Film Institute]] |access-date=28 January 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Social context==\n{{tone|section|date=March 2017}}\nFrances Gray acknowledges a common criticism of the play: why do the characters not consummate the affair? Gray argues that their problem is [[class consciousness]]: the working classes can act in a vulgar way, and the upper class can be silly; but the middle class is, or at least considers itself, the moral backbone of society\u2014a notion whose validity Coward did not really want to question or jeopardise, as the middle classes were his principal audience.<ref>{{cite book |last=Gray |first=Frances |title=Noel Coward |series=Macmillan Modern Dramatists |location=London, UK |publisher=Macmillan International Higher Education |year=1987 |isbn=1-3491-8802-6}}</ref>\n\nBut in her narration, Laura stresses that what holds her back is her horror at the thought of betraying her husband and her morals, tempted though she is by the force of her feelings. Indeed, this very tension has made the film such an enduring favourite.\n\nThe values Laura precariously, but ultimately successfully, clings to were widely shared and respected (if not always observed) at the time of the film's original setting (the status of a divorced woman, for example, remained sufficiently scandalous in the UK to cause [[Edward VIII]] to abdicate in 1936). Updating the story might have left those values behind and with them vanished the plot's credibility, which may be why [[Brief Encounter (1974 film)|the 1974 remake]] could not compete.<ref>{{cite book |last=Handford |first=Peter |title=Sounds of Railways |location=[[Newton Abbot]] |publisher=[[David & Charles]] |year=1980 |isbn=0-7153-7631-4}}</ref>\n\nThe film was released amid the social and cultural context of the Second World War, when 'brief encounters' were considered commonplace and women had far greater sexual and [[economic freedom]] than before. In ''British National Cinema'' (1997), Sarah Street argues that \"''Brief Encounter'' thus articulated a range of feelings about infidelity which invited easy identification, whether it involved one's husband, lover, children or country\" (p. 55). In this context, [[feminist]] critics read the film as an attempt at stabilising relationships to return to the status quo.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}\n\nIn his 1993 BFI book on the film, [[Richard Dyer]] notes that owing to the rise of [[homosexual]] law reform, gay men also saw the characters' plight as comparable to their own social constraints in forming and maintaining relationships. [[Sean O'Connor (producer)|Sean O'Connor]] considers the film an \"allegorical representation of forbidden love\" informed by Coward's experiences as a closeted gay man.{{sfnp|O'Connor|1998|p=157}}\n\n==Further adaptations==\n\n===Radio===\n[[File:Brief Encounter.JPG|thumb|alt=ALT TEXT|Jenny Seagrove and Nigel Havers rehearsing]]''Brief Encounter'' was adapted as a radio play on 20 November 1946 episode of ''[[Academy Award Theater]]'', starring [[Greer Garson]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Greer Garson Stars in \"Brief Encounter\" On Academy Award\u2014WHP |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/3225864/harrisburg_telegraph/ |newspaper=Harrisburg Telegraph |date=16 November 1946 |page=17 |via=[[Newspapers.com]]|access-date=14 September 2015}} {{Open access}}</ref> It was presented three times on [[The Screen Guild Theater]], on 12 May 1947 with [[Herbert Marshall]] and [[Lilli Palmer]], on 12 January 1948 with Marshall and [[Irene Dunne]], and on 11 January 1951 with [[Stewart Granger]] and [[Deborah Kerr]].
