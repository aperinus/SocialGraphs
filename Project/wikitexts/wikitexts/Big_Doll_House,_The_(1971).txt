The film follows six female inmates through daily life in a gritty, unidentified tropical prison. Later the same year, the film ''[[Women in Cages]]'' featured a similar story and setting and much the same cast, and was shot in the same abandoned prison buildings. A nonsequel follow-up, titled ''[[The Big Bird Cage]]'', was released in 1972.<ref>{{IMDb title|0066830}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nCollier (Brown) enters [[prison]], having been found guilty of killing her husband. She is introduced to the beautiful occupants of her cell, doing time for crimes ranging from political insurgency to [[heroin]] addiction. The women often clash, which leads to their [[torture]] by sadistic guard Lucian (Kathryn Loder). The torture ceremonies are viewed by an impassive cloaked figure.\n\nCollier's cellmates Alcott and Bodine (Collins and Woodell) plan to escape. Collier and another cellmate Ferina (Gina Stuart) agree to go along. Assisting is their other lesbian cellmate Grear ([[Pam Grier]]), though  doubts exist  Grear's heroin-addict girlfriend Harrad (Brooke Mills) will be equipped to escape.\n\nFerina, Alcott, and Bodine break from the solitary-confinement sauna and take their revenge on Lucian. The escapees wield guns, attitude, and sexuality to free themselves.\n\nDuring their escape, they round up various personnel from the prison as hostages, taking elegant prison warden Miss Dietrich ([[Christiane Schmidtmer]]), sympathetic prison medic Dr Phillips ([[Jack Davis (actor)|Jack Davis]]), and two local men regularly allowed access to the prison to sell market produce, Harry ([[Sid Haig]]) and Fred (Jerry Franks).\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Pam Grier]] as Grear\n* Judy Brown as Collier \n* [[Roberta Collins]] as Alcott\n* [[Sid Haig]] as Harry\n* Brooke Mills as Harrad\n* [[Pat Woodell]] as Bodine\n* [[Christiane Schmidtmer]] as Miss Dietrich\n* Kathryn Loder as Lucian\n\n==Production==\nThis was one of the first films made by [[B movie]] giant [[Roger Corman]] for his company New World Pictures. According to [[Stephanie Rothman]], Corman originally purchased a screenplay by James Gordon White, which he then asked to be rewritten. Rothman says  her husband [[Charles S. Swartz]], New World story editor Frances Doel, and she pitched story proposals to Jack Hill, who did not like any of them. They then plotted a new storyline themselves and hired Don Spencer to write the screenplay. Rothman also says that Corman wanted her to direct the picture, but she turned it down, so Corman hired Jack Hill, instead.<ref>[http://templeofschlock.blogspot.com.au/2010/07/stephanie-rothman-sets-record-straight.html 'Stephanie Rothman Sets Record Straight', ''Temple of Schlock'' July 31, 2010]</ref>\n\n[[John Ashley (actor)|John Ashley]] says Corman originally intended to make the film in Puerto Rico, but he persuaded them to make it in the Philippines. Ashley and his partners went on to put up the above-the-line part of the budget, with Corman providing the rest.<ref>Tom Weaver, \"Interview with John Ashley\", ''Interviews with B Science Fiction and Horror Movie Makers: Writers, Producers, Directors, Actors, Moguls and Makeup'', McFarland 1988 p 43</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|first=Stephen|last=Vagg|url=https://diaboliquemagazine.com/the-nine-lives-of-john-ashley/url=https://diaboliquemagazine.com/the-nine-lives-of-john-ashley/|magazine=Diabolique Magazine|title=A Hell of a Life: The Nine Lives of John Ashley|date=December 2019}}{{Dead link|date=October 2022 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\nThe film earned $3 million in rentals.<ref name=\"roger\">Roger Corman & Jim Jerome, ''How I Made a Hundred Movies in Hollywood and Never Lost a Dime'', Muller, 1990 p 183</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of American films of 1971]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|0066830}}\n* {{rottentomatoes|big_doll_house}}\n* [http://www.trailersfromhell.com/trailers/110 Jack Hill on ''The Big Doll House''] at [[Trailers From Hell]]\n\n{{Jack Hill}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Big Doll House, The}}\n[[Category:1971 films]]\n[[Category:1970s prison drama films]]\n[[Category:1970s English-language films]]\n[[Category:American exploitation films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Jack Hill]]\n[[Category:Philippine drama films]]\n[[Category:1970s exploitation films]]\n[[Category:American prison films]]\n[[Category:Women in prison films]]\n[[Category:New World Pictures films]]\n[[Category:Films shot in the Philippines]]\n[[Category:American sexploitation films]]\n[[Category:American crime thriller films]]\n[[Category:American LGBT-related films]]\n[[Category:LGBT-related thriller films]]\n[[Category:Films about prison escapes]]\n[[Category:1970s American films]]"}]}}}}
