Julie Newmar''''' is a 1995 American [[Road film|road]] [[comedy film]] directed by [[Beeban Kidron]] and starring [[Wesley Snipes]], [[Patrick Swayze]], and [[John Leguizamo]] as three [[New York City]] [[drag queen]]s who embark on a [[road trip]]. Its title refers to an iconic [[autograph]]ed photo of [[Julie Newmar]] that they carry with them on their journey. Newmar additionally appears in the film as herself.\n\nThe film was notable for being the first major [[Major film studios|Hollywood studio]] movie to center on drag queens. The film was released on September 8, 1995 and was in the number 1 spot in the North American box office for two weeks with a worldwide gross of $47.8 million. Critical response was mixed, with particular criticism towards the plot and its familiar elements, but Swayze, Snipes, and Leguizamo\u2019s performances were lauded. Swayze and Leguizamo both earned [[53rd Golden Globe Awards|Golden Globe Award]] nominations as [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor \u2013 Motion Picture Musical or Comedy|Best Actor]] and [[Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor \u2013 Motion Picture|Best Supporting Actor]], respectively.\n\n==Plot==\nAfter tying for the win in New York City's \"Drag Queen of the Year\" contest, Noxeema Jackson and Vida Boheme win a trip to [[Hollywood, Los Angeles|Hollywood]] to take part in the even bigger \"Miss Drag Queen of America Pageant\". Before they depart, Vida persuades Noxeema to take along the inexperienced \"drag princess\" Chi-Chi Rodriguez as their prot\u00e9g\u00e9 (they initially refer to him simply as a \"boy in a dress\" rather than as a full-fledged drag queen). To do this, they cash in their plane tickets to a friend, John Jacob Jingleheimer Schmidt, and use the money to buy a yellow convertible 1967 Cadillac DeVille. They set off for [[Los Angeles]] in it, carrying with them an iconic autographed photo of Julie Newmar (signed \"To Wong Foo, Thanks for Everything! Julie Newmar\") that Vida took from a restaurant wall.\n\nWhile on the road, they are pulled over by Sheriff Dollard, who hurls racial slurs, then forces Vida out of the car and tries to rape her. Vida strikes him and he is knocked unconscious. He is presumed dead and the queens drive off. At a rest stop, they recover from the incident but their car breaks down. Bobby Ray, a young man from the nearby small town of Snydersville, happens to pass by and gives them a ride to a bed and breakfast inn. The inn is owned by Carol Ann and her abusive car repairman husband, Virgil.\n\nThey are stranded in the town for the weekend waiting for the replacement part for their car. Chi-Chi is harassed by a group of roughnecks but is saved by Bobby Ray. While volunteering to help with the town's Strawberry Social, they decide the town's women need a day with them getting their hair done, picking out new outfits, and talking in a caf\u00e9. While searching for the new outfits, they are ecstatic to find vintage fashions from the 1960s in the town's clothing store and give the female residents (and themselves) a makeover.\n\nFollowing their makeover, they are abused by the same roughnecks that attempted to harass Chi-Chi. Fed up, Noxeema handles the situation in a typically New York City manner and teaches their ringleader a lesson in manners. Vida, Noxeema, and Chi-Chi do what they can to be positive, and they set out to improve the lives of the townspeople, including offering assistance in organizing the Strawberry Social. Meanwhile, Sheriff Dollard is ridiculed by his colleagues, who believe he was beaten up by a girl. He goes in search of the drag queens.\n\nVida becomes acutely aware of Carol Ann's abuse at the hands of Virgil, and one night decides to intervene and beats Virgil up before throwing him out of the house. Carol Ann is able to repair their car, but they remain for the Strawberry Social. Carol Ann reveals to Vida that she knew she was a drag queen all along due to her [[Adam's apple]].\n\nVirgil runs into Sheriff Dollard at a bar, and they realize that the newcomers are the same people Dollard has been searching for. They head back to Snydersville, and Dollard demands that the townspeople turn them over. The other townspeople, who now realize that their new friends are not women, devise a ruse to protect them. One by one, they confront Dollard, each one claiming to be a drag queen (in a similar fashion to ''[[Spartacus (film)|Spartacus]]''). Dollard is humiliated and flees. The Strawberry Social commences with everyone dressed in vibrant red outfits. The townspeople then say goodbye to Noxeema, Vida, and Chi-Chi as they prepare to leave. In honor of their friendship, Vida gives Carol Ann the autographed photo of Julie Newmar that has accompanied them on their trip.\n\nThey eventually make it to Los Angeles where Chi-Chi, after having received many tips from Vida and Noxeema during their ordeal, wins the title of Drag Queen of the Year. The crown is presented by Julie Newmar herself.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Wesley Snipes]] as Noxeema Jackson\n* [[Patrick Swayze]] as Vida Boheme\n* [[John Leguizamo]] as Chi-Chi Rodriguez\n* [[Stockard Channing]] as Carol Ann\n* [[Blythe Danner]] as Beatrice\n* [[Arliss Howard]] as Virgil\n* [[Jason London]] as Bobby Ray\n* [[Chris Penn]] as Sheriff Dollard\n* [[Melinda Dillon]] as Merna\n* [[Marceline Hugot]] as Katina\n* [[Mike Hodge]] as Jimmy Joe\n* Jamie Harrold as Billy Budd\n* [[Beth Grant]] as Loretta\n* [[Alice Drummond]] as Clara\n* [[Michael Vartan]] as Tommy\n* [[Jennifer Milmore]] as Bobbie Lee\n}}\n\n===Cameo appearances===\n{{castlist|\n* [[Julie Newmar]] as Herself\n* [[Naomi Campbell]] as Girl at China Bowl\n* [[Joey Arias|Joseph Arias]] as Joey Arias\n* [[Lady Catiria]] as Herself\n* [[Miss Understood|Alexander Heimberg]] as Miss Understood\n* [[Candis Cayne]] as Herself (credited as Brendan McDanniel)\n* [[Miss Coco Peru|Clinton Leupp]] as Miss Coco Peru\n* [[Hedda Lettuce|Steven Polito]] as Hedda Lettuce\n* [[Lady Bunny|Jon Ingle]] as The Lady Bunny\n* [[Quentin Crisp]] as NY pageant judge\n* [[Jos\u00e9 Sarria]] as NY pageant judge\n* [[RuPaul]] as Rachel Tensions\n* [[Robin Williams]] as John Jacob Jingleheimer Schmidt\n}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nWriter [[Douglas Carter Beane]] originally envisioned the script as a [[Play (theatre)|stage play]], but changed his mind when he realized putting a car on stage might not work.<ref name=\"Today.com\" /> Beane was inspired by an [[LGBT stereotypes|anti-gay]] [[propaganda film]] called ''The Gay Agenda''.
