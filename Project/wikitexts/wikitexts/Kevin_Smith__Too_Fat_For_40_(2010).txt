The title is a reference to his feud with [[Southwest Airlines]].{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} In the film, Smith's announced attempt to answer a multitude of questions quickly is derailed entirely when the first, and ultimately only, question posed is about working with [[Bruce Willis]], which begins a near-two-hour rant in which he discusses, among other things, the adult use of [[Cannabis (drug)|marijuana]], the highs and lows of making his 2008 film ''[[Zack and Miri Make a Porno]]'' and the stress of working with Willis during ''[[Cop Out (2010 film)|Cop Out]]''.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n\nThe special was filmed at the [[Count Basie Theatre]] in Smith's hometown of [[Red Bank, New Jersey]]. The stage background was a recreation of the storefronts from the [[Quick Stop Groceries]] (renamed \"Middle Age Stop Groceries\" and with the sign \"I Assure You I'm 40\" in place of the \"I Assure You We're Open\" sign) and [[Leonardo, New Jersey#In media|RST Video]] as seen in ''[[Clerks (1994 film)|Clerks]]'' and ''[[Clerks II]]''.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n\nOn October 18, 2011, [[Shout! Factory]] released ''Too Fat for 40'' on DVD and Blu-ray in the full 3.5-hour version of the special, which was cut down for broadcast. It is being sold both individually and as part of two special boxed sets, the first which includes the ''[[SModcast#SModimations|SModimations]]: Season One'' DVD and an exclusive DVD featuring a fully filmed episode of Kevin's ''[[Hollywood Babble-On]]'' podcast (which he co-hosts with [[Ralph Garman]]).<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.shoutfactorystore.com/prod.aspx?pfid=5257507&sid=D02CA3129BFF4EDD93AB313CF32A0FC0 |title=Shout!
