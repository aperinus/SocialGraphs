The film stars [[Robin Williams]], Damon, Affleck, [[Minnie Driver]], and [[Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd]].\n\n''Good Will Hunting'' received positive reviews from critics and grossed over $225&nbsp;million during its theatrical run against a $10&nbsp;million budget. At the [[70th Academy Awards]], it received nominations in nine categories, including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]] and [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]], and won in two: [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Supporting Actor]] for Williams and [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay|Best Original Screenplay]] for Affleck and Damon. In 2014, it was ranked at number 53 in ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]''{{'}}s \"100 Favorite Films\" list.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/person/good-will-hunting|title=Best Hollywood Movies of All Time - Hollywood Reporter|work=The Hollywood Reporter|date=June 25, 2014 |access-date=2014-11-22|archive-date=2014-11-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141126114246/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/person/good-will-hunting|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nTwenty-year-old Will Hunting of [[South Boston]] is a natural genius who is self-taught and been recently paroled from jail. He works as a janitor at [[MIT]] and spends his free time drinking with his step-brother Chuckie and his friends Billy and Morgan. When Professor Gerald Lambeau posts a difficult [[combinatorial]] mathematics problem on a blackboard as a challenge for his graduate students, Will solves the problem anonymously, stunning both the students and Lambeau. As a challenge to the unknown genius, Lambeau posts an even more difficult problem; he later catches Will writing the solution on the blackboard late at night, but initially thinks Will is vandalizing it and chases him off.\n\nAt a bar, Will meets Skylar, a British woman about to graduate from [[Harvard College]], who plans on attending medical school at [[Stanford University School of Medicine|Stanford]].\n\nThe next day, Will and his friends fight a gang that contains a member who used to bully Will as a child. Will is arrested after he attacks a responding police officer. Lambeau sits in on his court appearance and watches Will defend himself. He arranges for him to avoid jail time if he agrees to study mathematics under Lambeau's supervision and participate in psychotherapy sessions. Will tentatively agrees but treats his therapists with mockery. In desperation, Lambeau calls on Dr. Sean Maguire, his college roommate, who now teaches psychology at [[Bunker Hill Community College]]. Unlike other therapists, Sean actually challenges Will's [[defense mechanism]]s. During the first session, Will insults Sean's deceased wife, and Sean threatens him\u2014but after a few unproductive sessions, Will finally begins to open up.\n\nWill is particularly struck by Sean's story of how he met his wife, who later died of cancer, by giving up his ticket to [[1975 World Series#Game 6|the historic game six]] of the [[1975 World Series]], after falling in [[love at first sight]]. Sean's explanation for surrendering his ticket was to \"see about a girl,\" and he does not regret his decision. This encourages Will to build a relationship with Skylar, though he lies to her about his past and is reluctant to introduce her to his friends or show her his rundown neighborhood. Will also challenges Sean to take an objective look at his own life, since Sean cannot move on from his wife's death.\n\nLambeau sets up a number of job interviews for Will, but Will scorns them by sending Chuckie as his \"chief negotiator\", and by turning down a position at the [[National Security Agency|NSA]] with a scathing critique of the agency's moral position. Skylar asks Will to move to California with her, but he refuses and tells her he is an orphan, and that his foster father physically abused him. Will breaks up with Skylar and later storms out on Lambeau, dismissing the mathematical research he has been doing. Sean points out that Will is so adept at anticipating future failure in his interpersonal relationships that he deliberately sabotages them in order to avoid emotional pain. Chuckie likewise challenges Will over his resistance to taking any of the positions he interviews for, telling Will he owes it to his friends to make the most of opportunities they will never have, even if it means leaving one day. He then tells Will that the best part of his day is a brief moment when he waits on his doorstep thinking Will has moved on to something greater.\n\nWill walks in on a heated argument between Sean and Lambeau over his potential. Sean and Will share and find out that they were both victims of [[child abuse]]. Sean helps Will to see that he is a victim of his own inner demons and to accept that it is not his fault, causing him to break down in tears in Sean\u2019s arms. Will accepts one of the job offers arranged by Lambeau. Having helped Will overcome his problems, Sean reconciles with Lambeau, deciding to take a sabbatical. Will's friends present him with a [[Chevrolet Nova]] for his 21st birthday so he can commute to work. Later, Chuckie goes to Will's house to pick him up, only to find that he is not there, much to his happiness. Will sends Sean a letter telling him to tell Lambeau that he had to go \"see about a girl,\" revealing he passed on the job offer and instead is heading to California to reunite with Skylar.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Robin Williams]] as Dr. Sean Maguire\n* [[Matt Damon]] as Will Hunting\n* [[Ben Affleck]] as Chuckie Sullivan\n* [[Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd]] as Professor Gerald Lambeau\n* [[Minnie Driver]] as Skylar\n* [[Casey Affleck]] as Morgan O'Mally\n* [[Cole Hauser]] as Billy McBride\n* [[John Mighton]] as Tom\n* [[Scott William Winters]] as Clark\n* [[Jimmy Flynn]] as Judge George H.

[[Terrence Malick]] told Affleck and Damon over dinner that the film ought to end with Will's decision to follow his girlfriend Skylar to California, not them leaving together.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://tomshone.blogspot.com/2011/01/how-good-will-hunting-got-its-ending.html|title=THESE VIOLENT DELIGHTS: Malick gave Good Will Hunting its ending|date=2011-01-05|website=THESE VIOLENT DELIGHTS|access-date=2018-05-08|archive-date=2018-07-16|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180716111732/http://tomshone.blogspot.com/2011/01/how-good-will-hunting-got-its-ending.html|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nAt Reiner's request, screenwriter [[William Goldman]] read the script.

As a last resort, Affleck passed the script to his ''Chasing Amy'' director Kevin Smith, who read it and promised to walk the script directly into [[Harvey Weinstein]]'s office at Miramax. Weinstein read the script, loved it, and paid Castle Rock their due, while also agreeing to let Damon and Affleck star in the film. Weinstein asked that a few scenes be removed, including an out-of-place, mid-script [[oral sex]] scene that Damon and Affleck added to trick executives who were not looking closely.<ref name=\"boston\" />\n[[File:Dunkin' Donuts, Cambridge, MA.JPG|thumb|right|The [[Baskin-Robbins]]/[[Dunkin' Donuts]], in front of which Will mocked Harvard student Clark]]\n\nAfter buying the rights from Castle Rock, Miramax put the film into production.

When asked for a problem that Will could solve, Kleitman and Bohman suggested the unsolved computer science [[P versus NP problem]], but the movie used other problems.\n\nPatrick O'Donnell, professor of physics at the [[University of Toronto]], served as the mathematical consultant for the film.<ref>O'Donnell relied on ''Graph Theory and Theoretical Physics'' by [[Frank Harary]] where at page 63 P.W. Kasteleyn wrote on \"Graph theory and crystal physics\".</ref>\n\nThe main hallway blackboard is used twice to reveal Will Hunting's talent, first to the audience, second to Professor Lambeau. Matt Damon based it on his artist brother Kyle visiting MIT's [[Infinite Corridor]] and writing \"an incredibly elaborate, totally fake, version of an equation\" on a blackboard, which lasted for months. Kyle returned to Matt, saying that MIT needed those blackboards \"because these kids are so smart they just need to, you know, drop everything and solve problems!\"<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://news.mit.edu/2016/matt-damon-commencement-address-0603|title=Matt Damon's Commencement address|work=MIT News|access-date=2018-05-11|archive-date=2018-04-30|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180430161028/http://news.mit.edu/2016/matt-damon-commencement-address-0603|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===The first blackboard problem===\nNear the start of the film, Will sets aside his mop to study a difficult problem posed by Lambeau on the blackboard.<ref>[[Burkard Polster]] & Marty Ross (2012) ''Math goes to the Movies'', [[Johns Hopkins University Press]], page 9, {{ISBN|1-4214-0483-4}}</ref> The problem has to do with intermediate-level [[graph theory]], but Lambeau describes it as an advanced \"[[Fourier analysis|Fourier]] system.\"\n\nTo answer the first part of the question, Will chalks up an [[adjacency matrix]]:\n:<math>A=\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 & 0& 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 & 2 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 2 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}.</math> \nTo answer the second part, he determines the number of 3-step [[walk (graph theory)|walks]] in the graph, and finds the third power matrix:\n:<math>A^3=\\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 7 & 2 & 3 \\\\ 7 & 2 & 12 & 7 \\\\ 2 & 12 & 0 & 2 \\\\ 3 & 7 & 2 & 2 \\end{pmatrix}.</math>\nThe third and fourth parts of the question concern [[Generating function#Example: Spanning trees of fans and convolutions of convolutions|generating functions]]. The other characters are astounded that a janitor shows such facility with [[matrix (mathematics)|matrices]].\n\n===The second blackboard problem===\nLambeau subsequently poses a new challenge on the blackboard: state [[Cayley's formula]] and \"draw all the homeomorphically irreducible trees with <math>n=10</math>.\" Will writes eight of the ten trees correctly before Lambeau interrupts.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cantorsparadise.com/the-math-problems-from-good-will-hunting-w-solutions-b081895bf379|title=The Math Problems from Good Will Hunting, w/ solutions|author=Jorgen Veisdal|date=31 July 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n===Box office===\nIn the film's opening weekend in limited release, it earned $272,912.
