When an American [[submarine]] sinks in the Caribbean, a US search and recovery team works with an [[oil platform]] crew, racing against Soviet vessels to recover the boat. Deep in the ocean, they encounter something unexpected.\n\nThe film was released on August 9, 1989, receiving generally positive reviews and grossed $89.8 million. It won the [[Academy Award for Best Visual Effects]] and was nominated for three more Academy Awards.\n\n==Plot==\nIn January 1994, the U.S. {{sclass|Ohio|submarine|2}} USS ''Montana'' has an encounter with an [[unidentified submerged object]] and sinks near the [[Cayman Trough]]. With Soviet ships moving in to try to salvage the sub and a [[tropical cyclone|hurricane]] moving over the area, the U.S. government sends a [[United States Navy SEALs|SEAL]] team to ''Deep Core'', a privately owned experimental underwater [[drilling platform]] near the Cayman Trough to use as a base of operations. The platform's designer, Dr. Lindsey Brigman ([[Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio]]), insists on going along with the SEAL team, even though her estranged husband Virgil \"Bud\" Brigman ([[Ed Harris]]) is the current foreman.\n\nDuring the initial investigation of the ''Montana'', a power cut in the team's submersibles leads to Lindsey seeing a strange light circling the sub, which she later calls a \"non-terrestrial intelligence\" or \"NTI\". Lt. Hiram Coffey ([[Michael Biehn]]), the SEAL team leader, is ordered to accelerate their mission and takes one of the mini-subs without ''Deep Core''{{'}}s permission to recover a [[Trident (missile)|Trident missile]] warhead from the ''Montana'' just as the storm hits above, leaving the crew unable to disconnect from their surface support ship in time. The cable crane is torn from the ship and falls into the trench, dragging the ''Deep Core'' to the edge before it stops. The rig is partially flooded, killing several crew members and damaging its power systems.\n\nThe crew waits out the storm so they can restore communications and be rescued. As they struggle against the cold, they find the NTIs have formed an animated column of water to explore the rig, which they equate to an alien version of a [[Remotely operated underwater vehicle|remotely operated vehicle]]. Though they treat it with curiosity, Coffey is agitated and cuts it in half by closing a pressure bulkhead on it, causing it to retreat. Realizing that Coffey is suffering paranoia from [[high-pressure nervous syndrome]], the crew spies on him through an ROV, finding him and another SEAL arming the warhead to attack the NTIs. To try and stop him, Bud fights Coffey but Coffey escapes in a mini-sub with the primed warhead; Bud and Lindsey give chase in the other sub, damaging both. Coffey is able to launch the warhead into the trench, but his sub drifts over the edge and implodes from the pressure, killing him. Bud's mini-sub is inoperable and taking on water; with only one functional diving suit, Lindsey opts to enter deep hypothermia and trigger her [[diving reflex|mammalian diving reflex]] when the ocean's cold water engulfs her. Bud swims back to the platform with her body; there, he and the crew use a [[Defibrillation|defibrillator]] and administer [[CPR]], they are able to revive her.\n\nIt is decided that the warhead needs to be disarmed, which is more than 2 miles below them. One SEAL, Ensign Monk (Adam Nelson), helps Bud use an experimental diving suit equipped with a [[liquid breathing]] apparatus to survive to that depth, though he will only be able to communicate through a keypad on the suit. Bud begins his dive, assisted by Lindsey's voice to keep him coherent against the effects of the mounting pressure, and reaches the warhead. Monk guides him in successfully disarming it. With little oxygen left in the system, Bud explains he knew it was a one-way trip, and tells Lindsey he loves her. As he waits for death, an NTI approaches Bud, takes his hand, and guides him to a massive alien city deep in the trench. Inside, the NTIs create an atmospheric pocket for Bud, allowing him to breathe normally. The NTIs then play back Bud's message to his wife and they look at each other with understanding.\n\nOn ''Deep Core'' the crew is waiting for rescue when they see a message from Bud that he met some friends and warns them to hold on. The base shakes and lights from the trench herald the arrival of the alien ship. It rises to the ocean's surface, with ''Deep Core'' and several of the surface ships run aground on its hull. The crew of ''Deep Core'' exit the platform, surprised they are not [[decompression sickness|dead from the sudden decompression]]. They see Bud walking out of the alien ship and Lindsey races to hug him.\n\n===Special Edition===\nIn the [[Director's cut#Extended cuts and special editions|extended version]], the events in the film are played against a backdrop of conflict between the United States and the Soviet Union, with the potential for all-out war; the sinking of the ''Montana'' additionally fuels the aggression. There is more conflict between Bud and Lindsey in regard to their former relationship. The primary addition is the ending: when Bud is taken to the alien ship, they start by showing him images of war and aggression from news sources around the globe. The aliens then create massive [[megatsunami]]s that threaten the world's coasts, but stop them short before they hit. Bud asks why they spared the humans and they show Bud his message to Lindsey.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Ed Harris]] as Virgil \"Bud\" Brigman, Deep Core's foreman and Lindsey's estranged husband.\n* [[Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio]] as Dr. Lindsey Brigman, designer of the rig and Bud's estranged wife.\n* [[Michael Biehn]] as US Navy SEAL Lieutenant Hiram Coffey, the commander of the Navy SEAL team.\n* [[Leo Burmester]] as Catfish De Vries, a worker on the rig and a [[Vietnam veteran]] [[United States Marine Corps|Marine]] who is skeptical of the SEALs.\n* [[Todd Graff]] as Alan \"Hippy\" Carnes, a [[conspiracy theorist]] who believes that the NTIs have been covered up by the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]].\n* [[John Bedford Lloyd]] as Jammer Willis\n* J.C.

The basic idea did not change, but many of the details were modified over the years. Once Cameron arrived in Hollywood, he quickly realized that a group of scientists was not that commercial and changed it to a group of blue-collar workers.{{sfnp|Blair|1989|p=40}} While making ''[[Aliens (film)|Aliens]]'', Cameron saw a ''[[National Geographic Magazine|National Geographic]]'' film about remote operated vehicles operating deep in the North Atlantic Ocean. These images reminded him of his short story.{{sfnp|Smith|2001|p=106}} He and producer [[Gale Anne Hurd]] decided that ''The Abyss'' would be their next film.<ref name=\"Walker\"/> Cameron wrote a treatment combined with elements of a shooting script, which generated a lot of interest in Hollywood. He then wrote the script, basing the character of Lindsey on Hurd and finished it by the end of 1987.<ref name=\"Walker\"/> Cameron and Hurd were married before ''The Abyss'', separated during pre-production, and divorced in February 1989, two months after principal photography.<ref name=\"Harmetz\">{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/08/06/movies/film-the-abyss-a-foray-into-deep-waters.html?sec=&spon=&pagewanted=all |last=Harmetz |first=Aljean |title=A Foray into Deep Waters |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |page=15 |date=August 6, 1989 |access-date=2009-08-14 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101027195842/http://www.nytimes.com/1989/08/06/movies/film-the-abyss-a-foray-into-deep-waters.html?sec=&spon=&pagewanted=all |archive-date=October 27, 2010 }}</ref>\n\n===Pre-production===\nThe cast and crew trained for underwater diving for one week in the [[Cayman Islands]].{{sfnp|Blair|1989|p=38}} This was necessary because 40% of all live-action principal photography took place underwater. Furthermore, Cameron's production company had to design and build experimental equipment and develop a state-of-the-art communications system that allowed the director to talk underwater to the actors and dialogue to be recorded directly onto tape for the first time.{{sfnp|Blair|1989|p=39}}\n\nCameron had originally planned to shoot on location in the [[Bahamas]] where the story was set but quickly realized that he needed to have a completely controlled environment because of the stunts and special visual effects involved.{{sfnp|Blair|1989|p=39}} He considered shooting the film in [[Malta]], which had the largest unfiltered tank of water, but it was not adequate for Cameron's needs.{{sfnp|Smith|2001|p=106}} Underwater sequences for the film were shot at a unit of the [[Earl Owensby Studios|Gaffney Studios]], situated south of [[Cherokee Falls, South Carolina|Cherokee Falls]], outside [[Gaffney, South Carolina]], which had been abandoned by [[Duke Power]] officials after previously spending $700 million constructing the [[Cherokee Nuclear Power Plant]], along Owensby Street, Gaffney, South Carolina.{{sfnp|Blair|1989|p=38}}\n\nTwo specially constructed tanks were used. The first one, based on the abandoned plant's primary reactor containment vessel, held {{convert|7.5|e6USgal|m3}} of water, was 55 feet (18 m) deep and 209 feet (70 m) across. At the time, it was the largest fresh-water filtered tank in the world. Additional scenes were shot in the second tank, an unused turbine pit, which held {{convert|2.5|e6USgal|m3}} of water.{{sfnp|Blair|1989|p=39}} As the production crew rushed to finish painting the main tank, millions of gallons of water poured in and took five days to fill.{{sfnp|Smith|2001|p=107}} The Deepcore rig was anchored to a 90-ton concrete column at the bottom of the large tank. It consisted of six partial and complete modules that took over half a year to plan and build from scratch.{{sfnp|Blair|1989|p=58}}\n\nCan-Dive Services Ltd., a Canadian commercial diving company that specialized in [[saturation diving]] systems and underwater technology, specially manufactured the two working craft (Flatbed and Cab One) for the film. Two million dollars was spent on set construction.{{sfnp|Blair|1989|p=40}}\n\nFilming was also done at the largest underground lake in the world\u2014a mine in [[Bonne Terre, Missouri]], which was the background for several underwater shots.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bonneterrebiz.com/items/attractions/bonne-terre-mine-tour/ |title=Bonne Terre Mine Tour |work=bonneterrebiz.com |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130528182328/http://www.bonneterrebiz.com/items/attractions/bonne-terre-mine-tour/ |archive-date=2013-05-28}}</ref>\n\n===Principal photography===\nThe main tank was not ready in time for the first day of principal photography. Cameron delayed filming for a week and pushed the smaller tank's schedule forward, demanding that it be ready weeks ahead of schedule.{{sfnp|Smith|2001|p=107}} Filming eventually began on August 15, 1988, but there were still problems. On the first day of shooting in the main water tank, it sprang a leak and {{convert|150,000|USgal|m3}} of water a minute rushed out.<ref name=\"Walker\"/> The studio brought in dam-repair experts to seal it. In addition, enormous pipes with elbow fittings had been improperly installed. There was so much water pressure in them that the elbows blew off.<ref name=\"Walker\"/>\n\nCameron's cinematographer, [[Mikael Salomon]], used three cameras in watertight housings that were specially designed.{{sfnp|Blair|1989|p=58}} Another special housing was designed for scenes that went from above-water dialogue to below-water dialogue. The filmmakers had to figure out how to keep the water clear enough to shoot and dark enough to look realistic at 2,000 feet (700 m), which was achieved by floating a thick layer of plastic beads in the water and covering the top of the tank with an enormous [[tarpaulin]].{{sfnp|Blair|1989|p=58}} Cameron wanted to see the actors' faces and hear their dialogue, and thus hired Western Space and Marine to engineer helmets which would remain optically clear underwater and installed state-of-the-art aircraft quality microphones into each helmet. Safety conditions were also a major factor with the installation of a decompression chamber on site, along with a diving bell and a safety diver for each actor.{{sfnp|Blair|1989|p=58}}\n\nThe [[liquid breathing|breathing fluid]] used in the film actually exists but has only been thoroughly investigated in animals.<ref name=\"Kylstra\"/> Over the previous 20 years it had been tested on several animals, who survived.

He held his breath inside a helmet full of liquid while being towed 30 feet (10 m) below the surface of the large tank. He recalled that the worst moments were being towed with fluid rushing up his nose and his eyes swelling up.<ref name=\"Harmetz\"/>\n\nActors played their scenes at 33 feet (11 m), too shallow a depth for them to need decompression, and rarely stayed down for more than an hour at a time. Cameron and the 26-person underwater diving crew sank to 50 feet (17 m) and stayed down for five hours at a time. To avoid decompression sickness, they would have to hang from hoses halfway up the tank for as long as two hours, breathing pure oxygen.<ref name=\"Harmetz\"/>\n\nThe cast and crew endured over six months of grueling six-day, 70-hour weeks on an isolated set. At one point, Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio had a physical and emotional breakdown on the set and on another occasion, Ed Harris burst into [[Hysteria|spontaneous sobbing]] while driving home. Cameron himself admitted, \"I knew this was going to be a hard shoot, but even I had no idea just how hard. I don't ''ever'' want to go through this again\".{{sfnp|Blair|1989|p=40}}\n\nFor example, for the scene where portions of the rig are flooded with water, he realized that he initially did not know how to minimize the sequence's inherent danger. It took him more than four hours to set up the shot safely.<ref name=\"Harmetz\"/> Actor Leo Burmester said, \"Shooting ''The Abyss'' has been the hardest thing I've ever done. Jim Cameron is the type of director who pushes you to the edge, but he doesn't make you do anything he wouldn't do himself.\"{{sfnp|Blair|1989|p=38}} A lightning storm caused a 200-foot (65 m) tear in the black tarpaulin covering the main tank.{{sfnp|Smith|2001|p=107}} Repairing it would have taken too much time, so the production began shooting at night.{{sfnp|Smith|2001|p=108}} In addition, blooming algae often reduced visibility to 20 feet (6 m) within hours. Over-chlorination led to divers' skin burning and exposed hair being stripped off or turning white.{{sfnp|Smith|2001|p=108}}\n\nAs production went on, the slow pace and daily mental and physical strain of filming began to wear on the cast and crew. Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio remembered, \"We never started and finished any one scene in any one day\".<ref name=\"Harmetz\"/> At one point, Cameron told the actors to relieve themselves in their wetsuits to save time between takes.{{sfnp|Smith|2001|p=108}} While filming one of many takes of Mastrantonio's character's resuscitation scene\u2014in which she was soaking wet, topless and repeatedly being slapped and pounded on the chest\u2014the camera ran out of film, prompting Mastrantonio to storm off the set yelling, \"We are not animals!\"<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Hibberd |first=James |title=Ed Harris discusses his 9 best movie roles |date=29 November 2016 |magazine=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |url=http://ew.com/article/2016/11/29/ed-harris-movies/ |access-date=23 June 2018 |archive-date=June 24, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180624010553/http://ew.com/article/2016/11/29/ed-harris-movies/ |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nFor some shots in the scene that focus on Ed Harris, he was yelling at thin air because Mastrantonio refused to film the scene again. Michael Biehn also grew frustrated by the waiting. He claimed that he was in South Carolina for five months and only acted for three to four weeks.<ref name=\"Harmetz\"/> He remembered one day being ten meters underwater and \"suddenly the lights went out. It was so black I couldn't see my hand. I couldn't surface. I realized I might not get out of there.\" Harris recalled: \"One day we were all in our dressing rooms and people began throwing couches out the windows and smashing the walls. We just had to get our frustrations out.\"<ref name=\"McLean\"/>\n\nCameron responded to these complaints, saying, \"For every hour they spent trying to figure out what magazine to read, we spent an hour at the bottom of the tank breathing compressed air.\"<ref name=\"Harmetz\"/> After 140 days and $4 million over budget, filming finally wrapped on December 8, 1988.{{sfnp|Smith|2001|p=108}} Before the film's release, there were reports from South Carolina that Ed Harris was so upset by the physical demands of the film and Cameron's dictatorial directing style that he said he would refuse to help promote the motion picture. Harris later denied this rumor and helped promote the film.<ref name=\"Harmetz\"/> However, after its release and initial promotion, Harris publicly disowned the film, saying \"I'm never talking about it and never will.\" Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio also disowned the film, saying, \"''The Abyss'' was a lot of things.

As chronicled in the 1993 [[LaserDisc]] Special Edition release and later in the 2000 DVD, the pressure to cut the film's running time stemmed from both distribution concerns and [[Industrial Light & Magic]]'s then-inability to complete the required sequences. From the distributor's perspective, the looming three-hour length limited the number of times the film could be shown each day, assuming that audiences would be willing to sit through the entire film, though 1990's ''[[Dances with Wolves]]'' would shatter both industry-held notions. Further, test audience screenings revealed a surprisingly mixed reaction to the sequences as they appeared in their unfinished form; in post-screening surveys, they dominated both the \"Scenes I liked most\" and \"Scenes I liked least\" fields. Contrary to speculation, studio meddling was not the cause of the shortened length; Cameron held final cut as long as the film met a running time of roughly two hours and 15 minutes. He later noted, \"Ironically, the studio brass were horrified when I said I was cutting the wave.\"<ref>''The Abyss Special Edition DVD, The Restoration''</ref>\n\n<blockquote>What emerges in the winnowing process is only the best stuff. And I think the overall caliber of the film is improved by that. I cut only two minutes of ''Terminator''. On ''Aliens'', we took out much more. I even reconstituted some of that in a special (TV) release version.\n\nThe sense of something being missing on ''Aliens'' was greater for me than on ''The Abyss'', where the film just got consistently better as the cut got along. The film must function as a dramatic, organic whole. When I cut the film together, things that read well on paper, on a conceptual level, didn't necessarily translate to the screen as well. I felt I was losing something by breaking my focus. Breaking the story's focus and coming off the main characters was a far greater detriment to the film than what was gained. The film keeps the same message intact at a thematic level, not at a really overt level, by working in a symbolic way.<ref name=\"starlog\">{{cite magazine |title=James Cameron: Filmmaker Under Pressure |last=Spelling |first=Ian |date=January 1990 |magazine=[[Starlog]] |issue=150}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n[[File:8.23.12BiehnBlancByLuigiNovi17.jpg|thumb|Star [[Michael Biehn]] signing a copy of the film's DVD cover during an August 23, 2012, appearance at [[Midtown Comics]] in Manhattan.]]\nCameron elected to remove the sequences along with other, shorter scenes elsewhere in the film, reducing the running time from roughly two hours and 50 minutes to two hours and 20 minutes and diminishing his signature themes of nuclear peril and disarmament. Subsequent test audience screenings drew substantially better reactions.\n\nStar Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio publicly expressed regret about some of the scenes selected for removal from the film's theatrical cut: \"There were some beautiful scenes that were taken out. I just wish we hadn't shot so much that isn't in the film.\"<ref name=\"starlog\" />\n\nShortly after the film's premiere, Cameron and video editor Ed Marsh created a longer video cut of ''The Abyss'' for their own use that incorporated [[dailies]]. With the tremendous success of Cameron's ''[[Terminator 2: Judgment Day]]'' in 1991, [[Lightstorm Entertainment]] secured a five-year, $500 million financing deal with 20th Century Fox for films produced, directed or written by Cameron.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/04/22/movies/fox-locks-in-cameron-with-a-5-year-deal-worth-500-million.html |title=Fox Locks In Cameron With a 5-Year Deal Worth $500 Million |last=Weinraub |first=Bernard |date=April 22, 1992 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |access-date=27 October 2019 |archive-date=May 15, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180515115636/https://www.nytimes.com/1992/04/22/movies/fox-locks-in-cameron-with-a-5-year-deal-worth-500-million.html |url-status=live }}</ref> The contract allocated roughly $500,000 of the amount to complete ''The Abyss''.<ref>''The Toronto Star'', ''Starweek Magazine''</ref> ILM was commissioned to finish the work they had started three years earlier, with many of the same people who had worked on it originally.\n\nThe [[computer-generated imagery|CGI]] tools developed for ''Terminator 2: Judgment Day'' allowed ILM to complete the rumored [[tsunami|tidal wave]] sequence, as well as correcting flaws in rendering for all their other work done for the film.\n\nThe tidal wave sequence had originally been designed by ILM as a physical effect, using a plastic wave, but Cameron was dissatisfied with the end result, and the sequence was scrapped.

The Special Edition was completed in December 1992, with 28 minutes added to the film, and saw a limited theatrical release in [[New York City]] and [[Los Angeles]] on February 26, 1993, and expanded to key cities nationwide in the following weeks.
