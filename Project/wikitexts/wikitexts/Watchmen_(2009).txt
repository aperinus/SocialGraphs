A dark and dystopian deconstruction of the superhero genre, the film is set in an [[alternate history]] in the year 1985 at the height of the [[Cold War]], as a group of mostly retired American [[superheroes]] investigates the murder of one of their own before uncovering an elaborate and deadly conspiracy, while their [[Moral ambiguity|moral limitations]] are challenged by the complex nature of the circumstances.\n\nFrom October 1987 until October 2005, a [[live-action film]] adaptation of the ''Watchmen'' series became stranded in [[development hell]]. Producers [[Lawrence Gordon (producer)|Lawrence Gordon]] and [[Joel Silver]] began developing the project at [[20th Century Fox]], later moving it to [[Warner Bros. Pictures]], the sister company of ''Watchmen'' publisher DC Comics, and hiring director [[Terry Gilliam]], who eventually left the production and deemed the complex comic \"[[unfilmable]]\". During the 2000s, Gordon and [[Lloyd Levin]] collaborated with [[Universal Pictures]], [[Revolution Studios]] and [[Paramount Pictures]] to produce the film. Directors [[David Hayter]], [[Darren Aronofsky]] and [[Paul Greengrass]] were attached to the project before it was cancelled over budget disputes. In October 2005, the project returned to Warner Bros., where Snyder was hired to direct. Paramount remained as its international distributor, whereas Warner Bros. would distribute the film in the United States. However, Fox sued Warner Bros. for copyright violation arising from Gordon's failure to pay a buy-out in 1991, which enabled him to develop the film at the other studios. Fox and Warner Bros. settled this before the film's release, with Fox receiving a portion of the gross. [[Principal photography]] began in [[Vancouver]], September 2007. As with his previous film ''[[300 (film)|300]]'', Snyder closely modelled his [[storyboard]]s on the comic, but chose not to shoot all of ''Watchmen'' using [[chroma key|green screens]] and opted for real sets instead.\n\nFollowing its world premiere at [[Odeon Leicester Square]] on February 23, 2009,<ref>{{cite news|last=Hardie|first=Beth|title=Watchmen premiere: The stars come out in London \u2013 video and pics|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/watchmen-premiere-the-stars-come-out-379010|newspaper=[[Daily Mirror]]|access-date=May 22, 2014|date=February 24, 2009|archive-date=November 16, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201116174157/https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/watchmen-premiere-the-stars-come-out-379010|url-status=live}}</ref> the film was released in both conventional and [[IMAX]] theaters on March 6, 2009, and grossed $55 million on its opening weekend and over $185 million at the worldwide [[box office]].

[[Rorschach (character)|Rorschach]], a vigilante detective who operates illegally, discovers that the dead man was Edward Blake, better known as the [[Comedian (character)|Comedian]], a costumed hero who worked for the government.

Rorschach visits Jon Osterman ([[Doctor Manhattan]]), a physicist whose accidental superpowers make him a national security asset, but Osterman is preoccupied with energy research and ignores him.\n\nAt Blake's funeral, Osterman, Veidt and Dreiberg each recall the Comedian's cynicism in his later years about the Watchmen's<!-- see above --> mission. After the service, a lone mourner pays his respects. Rorschach tracks down and questions the mourner, former supervillain Edgar Jacobi (Moloch). Jacobi says that Blake had recently broken into his apartment while he was sleeping \u2014 tearful, unmasked and incoherent. Rorschach is astonished, but doubts that Jacobi would tell a lie so bizarre. During a press interview with Osterman, an investigative journalist tells him that several people who had contact with him have developed cancer, including his former girlfriend. As other reporters mob Osterman with questions, he shouts to be left alone and teleports them out of the studio. Escaping to Mars, he reflects on his existence as Doctor Manhattan and his regrets at being turned into a weapon. In his absence the [[Warsaw Pact]] countries make aggressive moves and Nixon prepares for war.\n\nVeidt survives an assassination attempt, suggesting that Rorschach's \"mask-killer\" theory is correct. Dreiberg takes in Laurie Jupiter ([[Silk Spectre]] II), a second-generation vigilante and estranged friend of Osterman, for protection. Rorschach's investigation of the assassin leads him back to Jacobi. While attempting to question Jacobi again, Rorschach is framed for his murder, arrested, and unmasked as a low-born vagrant. In prison he defends his vigilantism to a psychiatrist, saying that he cannot ignore evil and the people who cause it. Dreiberg and Jupiter, growing nostalgic for their crime-fighting days, put on their costumes and break Rorschach out of prison. Osterman teleports Jupiter to Mars while Dreiberg joins Rorschach's investigation of the Blake murder. Evidence points them to Veidt as the mastermind; they find him at an Antarctic hideout, where he has just overseen activation of Osterman's energy reactors in New York and other world cities. On Mars, Jupiter struggles to convince Osterman that humanity is worth saving, and succeeds only when he learns that Jupiter is Blake's illegitimate daughter, a fact so unlikely that it restores his faith.\n\nVeidt admits orchestrating Osterman's exile, hiring the assassin, framing Rorschach, and killing Blake who was spying on his activities. He has also executed the final step of his plan: turning the world against Osterman by rigging his reactors to explode, killing 15 million people. Osterman returns with Jupiter to a devastated New York, pieces together what has happened and teleports to Veidt's hideout. After a brief struggle, Veidt shows him that the countries of the world have put aside their rivalries to focus on a common enemy. Realizing the logic of Veidt's plan, the Watchmen<!-- see above --> agree to keep his secret, with the exception of Rorschach, whom Osterman kills to preserve the new global peace. Osterman departs permanently for another galaxy, Dreiberg rebukes Veidt's moral sacrifice, and Jupiter finally comes to terms with her parentage. A New York tabloid editor, disgusted that there is no war to report on, tells a reporter to grab something from a box of crank submissions that contains Rorschach's journal.\n\n== Cast and characters ==\n{{See also|List of Watchmen characters}}\n[[File:Watchmen cast.png|325px|thumbnail|right|The main cast of ''Watchmen'' (from left to right): The Comedian, Silk Spectre II, Doctor Manhattan, Ozymandias, Nite Owl II, and Rorschach]]\nProduction for ''Watchmen'' began casting in July 2007 for look-alikes of the era's famous names for the film\u2014something director [[Zack Snyder]] declared would give the film a \"satirical quality\" and \"create this '80s vibe.\"<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.mtv.com/news/movies//2009/03/02/lee-iacocca-is-alive-and-well-and-not-looking-forward-to-watchmen-movie/|title=Lee Iacocca Is Alive and Well&nbsp;\u2014 And Not Looking Forward to ''Watchmen'' Movie|first=Larry|last=Carroll|publisher=MTV|date=March 2, 2009 |access-date=June 18, 2009|archive-date=November 16, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201116174159/http://www.mtv.com/news/movies//2009/03/02/lee-iacocca-is-alive-and-well-and-not-looking-forward-to-watchmen-movie/ |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite news | url=https://www.comingsoon.net/news/movienews.php?id=21712|title=Look-Alikes Being Cast for ''Watchmen''|work=ComingSoon.net|date=July 3, 2007|access-date=July 3, 2007|archive-date=November 16, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201116174225/https://www.comingsoon.net/movies/news/21712-look-alikes-being-cast-for-watchmen|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |last=Larry |first=Carroll |title='Watchmen' Set Visit: Zack Snyder's Enthusiasm, The Owl Ship And ...
