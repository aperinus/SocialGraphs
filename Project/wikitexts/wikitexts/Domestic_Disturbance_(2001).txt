Danny, Susan and Frank's twelve-year-old son, is clearly unhappy that his mother is remarrying. Susan asks Frank to allow Rick to go sailing with him and Danny, to help Danny bond with and accept Rick as a stepfather.\n\nAfter the wedding, Danny and Rick play a game of catch, where Rick clearly becomes agitated with Danny's ambivalent playing style and starts criticizing him harshly. The revelation that Susan and Rick are having a baby worsens the situation. After finding out about the baby, Danny stows away in Rick's [[Chevrolet Suburban|Chevy Suburban]], planning to drop off it en route and visit his father. But while Danny is inside, he sees Rick murdering mysterious stranger Ray Farmer, who earlier attended the wedding unannounced, claiming to be an ex-business associate of Rick.\n\nDanny reports the murder to his father and to the local police. Rick, however, has managed to dispose of most of the evidence, and is widely considered a pillar of the local community as he invested his money in the area, whereas Danny has a history of lying and misdemeanors. Frank believes his son, though, stemming from Rick's notable unease around Ray at the ceremony and the fact that Danny never lies to him.\n\nFrank does some investigating of his own and unearths Rick's criminal past, which now stands to put his son and ex-wife at risk. Frank learns that Rick's true identity is Jack Parnell, a criminal who was acquitted while his partners, Ray among them, were convicted because he framed them all for the crime. Ray had planned to get revenge on Jack by exposing him at the wedding. Jack tries to kill Frank by setting his boathouse on fire, but Frank manages to escape and expose Jack's true identity to the police, who begin heading for Susan's house.\n\nAt the house, Susan also realizes the truth when she sees a large burn on Jack's arm, having heard about the fire at the boathouse minutes earlier. She tries to escape with Danny, but Jack knocks her out and takes Danny as a hostage, intending to flee. Frank arrives to confront Jack, and they both engage in a vicious fight, ending when a tied-up Danny pushes Jack into a fuse box, [[electric shock|electrocuting]] and killing him. Susan has no serious physical injury from the conflict, aside from suffering a [[miscarriage]]. The police apologize to both Danny and Frank for not believing them about Jack, and the reunited father and son follow Susan as she is taken to the hospital via ambulance.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[John Travolta]] as Frank Morrison\n*[[Vince Vaughn]] as Rick Barnes/Jack Parnell\n*[[Teri Polo]] as Susan Morrison\n*[[Matt O'Leary]] as Danny Morrison\n*[[Steve Buscemi]] as Ray Farmer\n*[[Susan Floyd]] as Diane\n*[[Ruben Santiago-Hudson]] as Sgt.
