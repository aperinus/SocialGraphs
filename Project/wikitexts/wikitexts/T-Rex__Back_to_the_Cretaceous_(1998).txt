The film is directed by [[Brett Leonard]]. Executive producer/co-writer Andrew Gellis and producers Antoine Compin and Charis Horton also make up the production team. Liz Stauber and [[Peter Horton]] star, alongside Kari Coleman, [[Tuck Milligan]], and Laurie Murdoch. When a museum accident transports teenager Ally Hayden on an adventure back in time, she explores the terrain and territory of life-sized dinosaurs, even during a nose-to-nose encounter with a female ''[[Tyrannosaurus]]''. The film is among the few IMAX films that are considered \"pure entertainment\", though it still is considered rather educational by the mainstream audience.\n\n==Plot==\n16-year-old Ally Hayden is the daughter of Dr. Donald Hayden, a world-famous [[paleontologist]] and [[museum curator]]. She loves dinosaurs and longs to be able to accompany him to one of the nearby paleontological digs, but her father thinks this is too dangerous and she has to settle for giving museum tours instead.\n\nA mysterious accident at the lab revolving an oblong fossil egg happens while Ally's father is away at a dig site with his assistant, and Ally is [[Time travel|magically transported back in time]]. Among the various time periods she visits are the [[Late Cretaceous]], when the ''[[Tyrannosaurus rex]]'' and ''[[Pteranodon]]'' existed. Ally is also transported to the early 20th century where she meets renowned historical figures in the world of paleontology. These include dinosaur painter [[Charles R. Knight|Charles Knight]] and [[Barnum Brown]], arguably one of the most famous paleontologists in early fossil-hunting history.\n\nThe shining moment of her trip to the past, however, is when Ally discovers a ''[[Tyrannosaurus rex]]'' nest (with up to five eggs) and then defends the nest from an ''[[Ornithomimus]]'', earning the mother ''T. rex'''s respect to the point where Ally actually strokes the mother ''T. rex'' (and befriends her). That is, before the meteoroid (at the [[K-T Extinction|end of the Cretaceous Period]]) impacts Earth, blasting Ally back into the present day. There, she is reunited with her father. As they leave the museum, the fossil egg begins to shake and, with only the museum kitten watching, it hatches into a living dinosaur egg and breaks apart, revealing a still living baby ''Tyrannosaurus''.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Liz Stauber]] as Ally Hayden\n* [[Peter Horton]] as Dr. Donald Hayden\n* [[Kari Coleman]] as Elizabeth Sample\n* [[Charlene Sashuk]] as Jesse Hayden\n* [[Dan Libman]] as The Guard\n* [[Tuck Milligan]] as [[Charles R.

Filming began by capturing the scenes in which Ally Hayden time-travels back to the turn of the century to go on expedition with famous bone-hunter Barnum Brown.\n\nFilming continued for two weeks on location in Dinosaur Provincial Park. Yet the filmmakers faced a challenge in finding a realistic environment to set the live-action filming portion for the Cretaceous period sequences when Ally finds herself wandering amidst the lush vegetation of 66 million years ago. The location used to film Cretaceous period scenes in the end was in the Olympia rain forest in upper [[Washington state]].\n\nThe special considerations that must be made when working with IMAX 3D presentation also made it crucial that the background features of the shooting locations were ideal.\n\nBesides shooting locations, extensive computer-generated imagery was also employed to ensure the realism of the dinosaurs depicted in the film. Models had to be sculpted and digitized, with details such as texturing crucial to the process. The filmmakers of the next year's television documentary series ''[[Walking with Dinosaurs]]'' also faced similar challenges.\n\n==Reception==\n{{expand section|date=May 2016}}\nThe film received positive notices from critics. On [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film has a 70% rating from 20 critics, with an average rating of 6.2/10.<ref>{{rotten-tomatoes|t_rex_back_to_the_cretaceous|T-Rex: Back to the Cretaceous}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Official website|http://www.imax.com/t-rex/main2.html}}\n* {{IMDb title|0163862|T-Rex: Back to the Cretaceous}}\n* {{rotten-tomatoes|t_rex_back_to_the_cretaceous|T-Rex: Back to the Cretaceous}}\n\n{{Brett Leonard}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:T-Rex: Back To The Cretaceous}}\n[[Category:1998 films]]\n[[Category:1990s 3D films]]\n[[Category:1990s adventure films]]\n[[Category:American 3D films]]\n[[Category:American adventure films]]\n[[Category:1990s English-language films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Brett Leonard]]\n[[Category:Films about dinosaurs]]\n[[Category:Films about time travel]]\n[[Category:Films scored by William Ross]]\n[[Category:1990s American films]]"}]}}}}
