Artificial Intelligence''''' (also known as '''''A.I.''''') is a 2001 American [[science fiction film]] directed by [[Steven Spielberg]]. The screenplay by Spielberg and screen story by [[Ian Watson (author)|Ian Watson]] were based on the 1969 short story \"[[Supertoys Last All Summer Long]]\" by [[Brian Aldiss]]. The film was produced by [[Kathleen Kennedy (producer)|Kathleen Kennedy]], Spielberg and [[Bonnie Curtis]]. It stars [[Haley Joel Osment]], [[Jude Law]], [[Frances O'Connor]], [[Brendan Gleeson]] and [[William Hurt]]. Set in a futuristic post-[[climate change]] society, ''A.I.'' tells the story of David (Osment), a childlike [[Android (robot)|android]] uniquely programmed with the ability to love.\n\nDevelopment of ''A.I.'' originally began after producer/director [[Stanley Kubrick]] acquired the rights to Aldiss' story in the early 1970s. Kubrick hired a series of writers until the mid-1990s, including Brian Aldiss, [[Bob Shaw]], Ian Watson, and [[Sara Maitland]]. The film languished in [[development hell]] for years, partly because Kubrick felt that [[computer-generated imagery]] was not advanced enough to create the David character, whom he believed no child actor would convincingly portray. In 1995, Kubrick handed ''A.I.'' to Spielberg, but the film did not gain momentum until Kubrick's death in 1999. Spielberg remained close to Watson's [[film treatment]] for the screenplay, and dedicated the film to Kubrick.\n\n''A.I. Artificial Intelligence'' was released on June 29, 2001 in North America by [[Warner Bros. Pictures]] and internationally by [[DreamWorks Pictures]]. It received generally positive reviews from critics, and grossed approximately $235 million against a budget of $90\u2013100 million. It was also nominated for [[Academy Award for Best Visual Effects|Best Visual Effects]] and [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Best Original Score]] (for [[John Williams]]) at the [[74th Academy Awards]]. In a 2016 [[BBC]] poll of 177 critics around the world, ''A.I. Artificial Intelligence'' was voted the eighty-third greatest film since 2000.<ref name=\"BBC\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20160819-the-21st-centurys-100-greatest-films |title=The 21st Century's 100 greatest films |work=BBC |date=August 23, 2016 |access-date=July 31, 2017 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170131124228/http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20160819-the-21st-centurys-100-greatest-films |archive-date=January 31, 2017  }}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for featured film articles should be 400-700 words. -->\n\nIn the 22nd century, [[Sea level rise|rising sea levels]] from [[global warming]] have wiped out coastal cities, reducing the world's population. Mecha humanoid robots, seemingly capable of complex thought but lacking in emotions, have been created.\n\nIn [[Madison, New Jersey]], David, a prototype Mecha child capable of experiencing love, is given to Henry Swinton and his wife Monica, whose son Martin contracted a rare disease and has been placed in [[suspended animation]]. Monica initially feels uneasy with David, but eventually warms to him and activates his [[Imprinting (psychology)|imprinting]] protocol, causing him to have an enduring, childlike love for her. David seeks to have Monica express the same love towards him, and also befriends Teddy, Martin's robotic teddy bear. Martin is unexpectedly cured of his disease and brought home. Martin becomes jealous of David and goads him to perform worrisome acts, such as cutting off the locks of Monica's hair while she is sleeping. At a pool party, one of Martin's friends pokes David with a knife, triggering his self-protection programming. David grabs onto Martin, and they both fall to the bottom of the pool, with David holding Martin tightly. Others jump in and save Martin before he drowns, and David is accused of being a danger to living people. Henry convinces Monica to return David to his creators to be destroyed, thinking that if David can love, he also can hate. On the way there, Monica has a change of heart and spares David from destruction by leaving him in the woods. With Teddy as his only companion, David recalls ''[[The Adventures of Pinocchio]]'' and decides to find the [[The Fairy with Turquoise Hair|Blue Fairy]] so that she may turn him into a real boy, which he believes will win back Monica's love.\n\nDavid and Teddy are captured by a \"Flesh Fair\", a traveling circus-like event where obsolete Mecha are destroyed before jeering crowds who hate Mecha, believing them to be both dangerous and a cause of human unemployment. About to be destroyed himself, David pleads for his life, and the audience, deceived by David's realistic nature, revolts and allows David to escape alongside Gigolo Joe, a male prostitute Mecha on the run from authorities after being framed for murder. David, Teddy, and Joe go to the decadent [[resort town]] of Rouge City, where \"Dr. Know\", a [[Holography|holographic]] answer engine, directs them to the top of [[Rockefeller Center]] in the flooded ruins of [[Manhattan]] and also provides fairy tale information interpreted by David as suggesting that a Blue Fairy has the power to help him. Above the ruins of Manhattan, David meets Professor Hobby, his creator, who tells him that their meeting demonstrates David's ability to love and desire. David finds many copies of himself, including female variants called \"Darlene\", boxed and ready to be shipped. Disheartened by his lost sense of individuality, David attempts suicide by falling from a skyscraper into the ocean. While underwater, David catches sight of a figure resembling the Blue Fairy before Joe rescues him in an amphibious aircraft. Before David can explain, Joe is captured via [[electromagnet]] by authorities. David and Teddy take control of the aircraft to see the Fairy, which turns out to be a statue from an attraction on [[Coney Island]]. The two become trapped when the [[Wonder Wheel]] falls on their vehicle. Believing the Blue Fairy to be real, David asks the statue to turn him into a real boy and repeats this request until his internal power source is depleted.\n\nTwo thousand years later, humanity has become [[Human extinction|extinct]] and [[Manhattan]] is now [[Ice age|buried under glacial ice]]. The Mecha have evolved into an advanced form, and a group of them called the Specialists have become interested in learning about humanity. They find and revive David and Teddy. David walks to the frozen Blue Fairy statue, which collapses when he touches it. The Specialists reconstruct the Swinton family home from David's memories and explain to him, via an interactive image of the Blue Fairy, that it is impossible to make David a real boy. However, at David's insistence, they use their scientific knowledge to recreate Monica through genetic material from the strand of hair that Teddy kept. This Monica can live for only one day, and the process cannot be repeated. David spends his happiest day with Monica, and as she falls asleep in the evening, she tells David that she has always loved him: \"the everlasting moment he had been waiting for\", the narrator says; \"David falls asleep as well and goes to that place 'where dreams are born.'\"\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Haley Joel Osment]] as David.
