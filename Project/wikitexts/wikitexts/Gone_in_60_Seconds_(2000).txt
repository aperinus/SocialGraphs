The film was directed by [[Dominic Sena]], written by [[Scott Rosenberg]], and produced by [[Jerry Bruckheimer]]. The film is a loose [[remake]] of the 1974 [[H. B. Halicki]] film [[Gone in 60 Seconds (1974 film)|of the same name]].\n\nThe film was shot throughout [[Los Angeles]] and [[Long Beach, California]]. It was released on June 9, 2000, by [[Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures|Buena Vista Pictures]] (through its [[Touchstone Pictures]] label). Upon release, ''Gone in 60 Seconds'' received generally negative reviews from critics, with criticism for its writing, its direction, as well as the acting and the action sequences. Despite the critical response, the film grossed $237 million against an estimated production budget of $90 million.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, the plot summary should be 400-700 words. -->\n[[Motor vehicle theft|Car thief]] Kip Raines works with his gang to steal fifty high-end cars for Raymond Calitri, a British gangster in [[Long Beach, California]]. After stealing a [[Porsche 996]] from a showroom, Kip unwittingly leads the police to his crew's warehouse, forcing the thieves to flee. Detectives Castlebeck and Drycoff impound the stolen cars and open an investigation. Atley Jackson, Calitri's associate, reaches out to Kip's older brother Randall \"Memphis\" Raines, a notorious but reformed car thief. Memphis meets with Calitri, who has kidnapped Kip and intends to kill him in a [[car crusher]]. Memphis agrees to steal the fifty cars within 72 hours, and Kip is released; Calitri warns that if the cars are not delivered on time, Kip will be killed.\n\nMemphis visits his mentor Otto Halliwell and they assemble a crew of old associates: Donny Astricky, now a driving instructor; Sphinx, a mute mortician; and Sara \"Sway\" Wayland, a mechanic and bartender. Kip and his crew volunteer to help, and the group tracks down the cars, giving each a code name; Memphis insists on saving a 1967 [[Ford Shelby GT500]], dubbed \"[[Eleanor (car)|Eleanor]]\"\u2014which he has attempted to steal before\u2014for last. While scouting the cars, he and Kip narrowly avoid being killed by a rival gang. Hoping to deliver the cars before they can be traced, the crew plans to steal all fifty cars in one night.\n\nCastlebeck and Drycoff learn that Kip bribed a [[Mercedes-Benz|Mercedes]] dealership employee to order laser-cut [[immobiliser|transponder keys]], enabling the detectives to [[stakeout]] the Mercedes cars on the crew's list. A member of Kip's crew impulsively steals a [[Cadillac Eldorado]] not on the list, and the crew discovers a stash of [[heroin]] in the trunk. Castlebeck arrives, forcing the crew to distract him while they dispose of the drugs. He leaves, having ascertained that the heist is happening that night.\n\nThe crew sets their heist in motion, stealing the various cars and delivering them to Atley on the docks. As they prepare to use the transponder keys to steal the Mercedes cars, Memphis spots Castlebeck and Drycoff watching from a surveillance van. Abandoning the cars under surveillance, the crew breaks into the police impound lot, distracting the guard and stealing the Mercedes cars originally stolen by Kip's crew; the plan is hampered temporarily when Otto's dog eats, and eventually passes, the keys. Memphis and Sway rekindle their past romance while stealing a [[Lamborghini Diablo]]. Castlebeck and Drycoff return to the warehouse seized from Kip's crew. Having found pieces of a broken [[blacklight]] lamp, the detectives discover the crew's list of fifty cars written in ultraviolet-sensitive paint. With too many cars to track, Castleback focuses on the Shelby GT500, knowing Memphis will steal it last, and determines the location of the only 1967 Shelby in the area. When the crew steals a [[Cadillac Escalade]], security is alerted, and a member of Kip's crew is injured. Memphis steals Eleanor just as the detectives arrive, and leads police on a chase through the city and into a [[shipyard]]. Reaching the [[Vincent Thomas Bridge]], blocked by an accident, Memphis jumps Eleanor off the ramp of a tow truck and lands on the other side, evading the police.\n\nMemphis arrives at Calitri's [[wrecking yard|junkyard]] twelve minutes late, and Calitri refuses to accept the slightly damaged Shelby, ordering his men to crush the car and kill Memphis. Kip and Atley use the junkyard crane to knock out the henchmen, and an armed Calitri pursues Memphis into the warehouse as the detectives arrive. Calitri prepares to shoot Castlebeck, but Memphis kicks Calitri over a railing to his death. A grateful Castlebeck lets Memphis go free, and Memphis tells him where to find the container ship full of stolen cars.\n\nThe crew celebrates with a barbecue, and Kip reveals that he has bought Memphis a dilapidated 1967 Shelby GT500 which Memphis also calls \"Eleanor\". Otto promises to restore the car, and Memphis invites Sway on a ride, but the car breaks down just as they drive away.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Nicolas Cage]] as Randall \"Memphis\" Raines, a former car thief who comes out of retirement to steal 50 cars in exchange for his brother's life\n* [[Angelina Jolie]] as Sara \"Sway\" Wayland, a mechanic and bartender who becomes Memphis' girlfriend\n* [[Robert Duvall]] as Otto Halliwell, Memphis' former mentor\n*[[Will Patton]] as Atley Jackson, Raymond Calitri's associate\n* [[Delroy Lindo]] as Detective Roland Castlebeck, a police detective investigating stolen cars, who goes after Memphis\n* [[Giovanni Ribisi]] as Kip Raines, a car thief and Memphis' brother\n* [[Christopher Eccleston]] as Raymond Calitri, a British gangster and Kip's former boss who gives Memphis the task of delivering 50 stolen cars for him in exchange for Kip's life\n* [[Vinnie Jones]] as \"Sphinx\", a mute mortician\n* [[Scott Caan]] as \"Tumbler\"\n* T.J.
