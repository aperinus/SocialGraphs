It was theatrically released by [[Paramount Pictures]] on October 5, 1961, to critical and commercial success.\n\nNominated for five [[34th Academy Awards|Academy Awards]] (winning two), with the music (including \"[[Moon River]]\") nominated for six [[4th Annual Grammy Awards|Grammy Awards]] (winning five), the film was selected in 2012 for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] as being \"culturally, historically or aesthetically significant\".\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- PER WP:FILMPLOT, PLOT SUMMARIES FOR FEATURE FILMS SHOULD BE BETWEEN 400 AND 700 WORDS. -->\nEarly one morning, a taxi pulls up in front of the [[Tiffany & Co. flagship store]] and from it emerges elegantly dressed Holly Golightly, carrying a paper bag containing her breakfast. After looking into the store's window displays, she strolls to her apartment and has to fend off her date from the night before. Once inside, Holly cannot find her keys, so she buzzes her landlord, [[I. Y. Yunioshi|Mr. Yunioshi]], to let her in. Later, she is awakened by new neighbor Paul Varjak, who rings her doorbell to get into the building. The pair chat as she dresses to leave for her weekly visit to mobster Sally Tomato, who is currently incarcerated at [[Sing Sing]]. Tomato's lawyer pays her $100 a week to deliver \"the weather report\".\n\nAs she is leaving, Holly is introduced to Paul's \"decorator\", wealthy older woman Emily Eustace Failenson, whom Paul nicknames \"2E\". That night, when Holly goes out onto the fire escape to elude an over-eager date, she peeks into Paul's apartment and sees 2E leaving money and kissing him goodbye. Visiting Paul afterward, she learns he is a writer who has not had anything published since a book of vignettes five years before. Holly, in turn, explains she is trying to save money to support her brother Fred after he completes his Army service. The pair fall asleep but are awakened when Holly has a nightmare about her brother. When Paul questions her about this, Holly chides him for prying. She later buys Paul a [[typewriter ribbon]] to apologize and invites him to a wild party at her apartment. There, Paul meets her Hollywood agent, who describes Holly's transformation from a country girl into a Manhattan socialite, along with wealthy Brazilian politician Jos\u00e9 da Silva Pereira, and Rusty Trawler, the \"ninth richest man in America under 50\".\n\n[[File:Audrey Hepburn Tiffany's.jpg|thumb|left|[[Audrey Hepburn]] as Holly Golightly]]\nSome time later, 2E enters Paul's apartment, worried she is being followed. Paul tells her he will investigate and eventually confronts Holly's husband, Doc Golightly, who explains that Holly's real name is Lula Mae Barnes and that they were married when she was approaching 14. Now he wants to take her back to rural Texas. After Paul reunites Holly and Doc, she informs Paul that the marriage was [[annulled]]. At the [[Greyhound Lines|Greyhound]] bus station, she tells Doc she will not return with him, and he leaves broken-hearted.\n\nAfter drinking at a club, Paul and Holly return to her apartment, where she drunkenly tells him that she plans to [[Marriage of convenience|marry Trawler for his money]].  A few days later, Paul learns that one of his short stories will be published. On the way to tell Holly, he sees a newspaper headline stating that Trawler has married someone else. Holly and Paul agree to spend the day together, taking turns doing things each has never done before.  At Tiffany's, Paul has the ring from Doc Golightly's box of [[Cracker Jack]] engraved as a present for Holly. After spending the night together, he awakens to find her gone. When 2E arrives, Paul ends their relationship. She calmly accepts, having earlier concluded that he was in love with someone else.\n\nHolly now schemes to marry Jos\u00e9 for his money, but after receiving a telegram notifying her of her brother's death in a jeep accident, she trashes her apartment. Months later, she invites Paul to dinner, as she is leaving the next morning for Brazil to continue her relationship with Jos\u00e9. However, the pair are arrested in connection with Sally Tomato's drug ring, and Holly spends the night in jail.\n\nThe next morning, Hollywood friend O.J. Berman pays Holly's bail. Paul is waiting for her in a cab, bringing her pet, \"Cat\", and a letter from Jos\u00e9 explaining that he must end their relationship due to her arrest. Holly insists that she will go to Brazil anyway; she asks the cab to pull over and pushes Cat out into the pouring rain. Just after they get underway again, Paul storms out of the cab, tossing the engraved ring into her lap and telling her to examine her life. She goes through a decision-making moment, puts on the ring and runs after Paul, who has gone looking for Cat. Finally, Holly finds Cat sheltering in an alley and, with it tucked into her coat, she and Paul embrace.\n\n==Cast==\n<!--- Cast and order per opening tombstone credits --->\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Audrey Hepburn]] as Holly Golightly\n* [[George Peppard]] as Paul Varjak\n* [[Patricia Neal]] as Mrs. Emily Eustace \"2E\" Failenson\n* [[Buddy Ebsen]] as Doc Golightly\n* [[Martin Balsam]] as O.J.

Changes were made to fit the medium of cinema and to correspond to the filmmakers' vision. Capote, who sold the film rights of his novella to Paramount Studios, wanted [[Marilyn Monroe]] to play Holly Golightly, whom he had described perfectly in the book. Barry Paris cites Capote's own comments on the choice of actress: \"Marilyn was always my first choice to play the girl, Holly Golightly.\" Screenwriter Axelrod was hired to \"tailor the screenplay for Monroe\". When [[Lee Strasberg]] advised Monroe that playing a \"lady of the evening\" would be bad for her image, she turned it down and performed in ''[[The Misfits (1961 film)|The Misfits]]'' instead. When Hepburn was cast instead of Monroe, Capote remarked: \"Paramount double-crossed me in every way and cast Audrey\".<ref name=\"Paris\">{{cite book|last=Paris|first=Barry|title=Audrey Hepburn|publisher=[[Berkley Books]]|year=1996|isbn=978-0399140563}}</ref> [[Shirley MacLaine]] was also offered the part of Holly, but she turned it down and performed in ''[[Two Loves]]'' instead.<ref>{{cite news|last=Foerster|first=Jonathan|title=Shirley MacLaine isn't getting old, she's just advanced|date=9 February 2011|newspaper=[[Naples Daily News]]|url=http://archive.naplesnews.com/entertainment/shirley-maclaine-isnt-getting-old-shes-just-advanced-ep-392244535-334584291.html/|access-date=27 June 2017}}</ref> [[Kim Novak]] also turned down the role of Holly.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.interviewmagazine.com/film/new-again-kim-novak|title = New Again: Kim Novak|date = February 15, 2012}}</ref> [[Steve McQueen]] was offered the role of Paul Varjak, but declined the offer due to being under contract.<ref>[https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/73079/18-hearty-facts-about-breakfast-tiffanys 18 Hearty Facts About 'Breakfast at Tiffany's']</ref>\n\nAxelrod worked with the original director of the film [[John Frankenheimer]] for a period of three months, but Hepburn's agent wanted a more known director, with the result that Frankenheimer was removed from the project.<ref>Wasson, Sam ''Fifth Avenue, 5 A.M.: Audrey Hepburn in Breakfast at Tiffany's'' Aurum Press, 25 Sep 2011</ref>\n\n===Principal photography===\n[[File:Audrey Hepburn in Breakfast at Tiffany's.jpg|thumb|left|Hepburn in the opening scene]]\nFilming began on Fifth Avenue outside the Tiffany & Co. flagship store on October 2, 1960.<ref>{{cite web|last=Gristwood|first=Sarah|title=Breakfast at Tiffany's: 50 Years On|work=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]|date=30 September 2010|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/classic-movies/8032801/Breakfast-at-Tiffanys-50-years-on.html |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20220112/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/classic-movies/8032801/Breakfast-at-Tiffanys-50-years-on.html |archive-date=January 12, 2022 |url-access=subscription |url-status=live}}{{cbignore}}</ref> Most of the exteriors were filmed in [[New York City]], and all of the interiors, except for portions of the scene inside Tiffany & Company, were filmed on the [[Paramount Studios lot]] in Hollywood.<ref>{{cite web | url =https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0054698/locations?ref_=ttfc_ql_5 | title =Breakfast at Tiffany's (1961): Filming and Production | website =imdb.com | access-date =2019-12-03}}</ref>\n\nAccording to one report, the film's on-location opening sequence, in which Holly gazes into a [[Tiffany & Co.|Tiffany's]] [[display window]], was extremely difficult for director [[Blake Edwards]] to shoot.

Those that didn't like it, I forgive them and God bless America, God bless the universe, God bless Japanese, Chinese, Indians, all of them and let's have peace.\"<ref name=\"scripps08\" />\n\nThe film continues to draw criticism for this character, now widely considered to be a racist caricature, particularly when the movie is selected as a \"classic\" screened in public spaces, supported by tax dollars. In 2011, a [[SyFy]] and  Brooklyn Bridge Park Corporation screening inspired petitions.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/07/13/brooklyn-breakfast-at-tiffanys_n_897557.html|title='Breakfast At Tiffany's' Brooklyn Screening Sparks Protests From Asian-American Group|date=July 13, 2011|via=Huff Post}}</ref>\n\nFilm historian and [[Turner Classic Movies]] host [[Robert Osborne]] stated in a Q&A that he would recast Rooney from the picture saying, \"that was such a racial slur, out of nowhere, and I blame Blake Edwards for that decision, the caricature was totally embarrassing\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thefilmsinmylife.com/2015/11/robert-osborne-recasts-breakfast-at.html?m=1|title= Robert Osborne recasts Breakfast at Tiffany's|website= thefilmsinmylife|access-date= April 13, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Awards and honors==\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n!
