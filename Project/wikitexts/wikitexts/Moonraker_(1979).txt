The carrier is destroyed but no wreckage of the shuttle is found. [[M (James Bond)|M]], head of [[MI6]], assigns James Bond, Agent 007, to investigate. En route to England, Bond is attacked and pushed out of an aeroplane by the mercenary assassin [[Jaws (James Bond)|Jaws]]. He survives by stealing a parachute from the pilot, while Jaws lands on a [[Flying trapeze|trapeze]] net within a circus tent. At the Drax Industries spaceplane-manufacturing complex in California, Bond meets the owner of the company, Hugo Drax, and his henchman Chang. Bond also meets Dr. Holly Goodhead, an astronaut, and survives an assassination attempt while inside a [[High-G training|centrifuge chamber]]. Drax's personal pilot, Corinne Dufour, helps Bond find blueprints for a glass vial made in Venice; Drax discovers her involvement and has her killed by his pet dogs.\n\nIn Venice, Bond encounters Goodhead and observes her snooping around a door near the glass factory, then is chased through the canals by Drax's henchmen. He returns to the factory at night to investigate and discovers a secret biological laboratory, and learns that the glass vials are to hold a [[nerve gas]] deadly to humans, but harmless to plants and animals. Chang attacks Bond, but Bond hurls him through the stained glass clockface of the Saint Mark's clocktower, killing him; during the fight, Bond finds evidence that Drax is moving his operation to Rio de Janeiro. Rejoining Goodhead, he deduces that she is a [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] agent spying on Drax. Bond has saved one of the vials he found earlier, as the only evidence of the now-empty laboratory; he gives it to M for analysis, who permits him to go to Rio de Janeiro under the pretense of being on leave.\n\nBond survives attacks by Jaws, Chang's replacement, during [[Rio Carnival]] and on the [[Sugarloaf Cable Car]]. After Jaws' cable car crashes, he is rescued from the rubble by Dolly, a young woman, and the two fall in love. Drax's forces capture Goodhead, but Bond escapes; he learns that the toxin comes from a rare orchid indigenous to the Amazon jungle. Bond travels the Amazon River and comes under attack from Drax's forces, before eventually locating his base. Captured by Jaws, Bond is taken to Drax and witnesses four Moonrakers lifting off. Drax explains that he stole back the loaned Shuttle because another in his fleet had developed a fault during assembly. Bond and Goodhead are locked in a room under the launch platform, and narrowly escape being burned alive by the exhausts of ''Moonraker 5'', which is carrying Drax, and pose as pilots on ''Moonraker 6''. The shuttles dock with Drax's space station, hidden from radar by a [[cloaking device]].\n\nBond and Goodhead disable the [[Radar jamming and deception|radar jamming]] cloaking device; the United States sends a platoon of [[United States Marine Corps|Marines]] aboard another shuttle to intercept the now-visible space station. Jaws captures Bond and Goodhead, to whom Drax reveals his plan to destroy human life by launching 50 globes that would disperse the nerve gas into Earth's atmosphere. Drax had transported several dozen genetically perfect young men and women of varying races to the space station in the shuttles. They would live there until Earth was safe again for human life, their descendants a \"new master race\". Bond persuades Jaws to switch his allegiance by getting Drax to admit that anyone not measuring up to his physical standards, including him and Dolly, would be exterminated. Jaws attacks Drax's guards, and a laser battle ensues between Drax's forces and Bond, Jaws, and the Marines. Drax's forces are defeated as the station is destroyed, while Bond shoots and [[Space exposure|ejects Drax into space]]. Bond and Goodhead use Drax's laser-armed ''Moonraker 5'' to destroy the three launched globes and return to Earth. Jaws and Dolly, who ejected themselves in one of Drax's [[escape pod]]s, are recovered by the Marines. Bond's superiors get a video feed of ''Moonraker 5'' and are bemused to see Bond and Goodhead making love in zero gravity.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Roger Moore]] as [[James Bond filmography|James Bond 007]], an MI6 agent assigned to look into the theft of a shuttle from the \"Moonraker\" space programme.\n* [[Lois Chiles]] as [[Holly Goodhead]], an astronaut scientist on loan from NASA working at Drax Industries.

Drax has a plan for a master race in the film, but in the novel actually had been a Nazi (unbeknownst to the British). The dramatic scene of Bond and his female companion being trapped in an exhaust duct under a rocket where they are nearly burned to death also appears in the film. Otherwise the film is more in keeping with contemporary trends in science fiction. The 2002 Bond film ''[[Die Another Day]]'' makes further use of some ideas and character names from the novel. [[Tom Mankiewicz]] wrote a short outline for ''Moonraker'' that was mostly discarded. According to Mankiewicz, footage shot at Drax's lairs was considerably more detailed than the edited result in the final version.<ref name=\"MI6\">{{cite web|title=Moonraker:Cut Scenes & Alternate Versions|url=http://www.mi6-hq.com/sections/movies/mr.php3|access-date=3 October 2008|publisher=mi6-hq.com}}</ref> Some scenes from Mankiewicz's script were used in subsequent films, including the Acrostar Jet sequence, used in the pre-credit sequence for ''[[Octopussy]]'', and the [[Eiffel Tower]] scene in ''[[A View to a Kill]]''.<ref name=\"Inside Moonraker\"/>\n\nIn 1978 [[Steven Spielberg]] offered to direct the film after the release of ''[[Close Encounters of the Third Kind]]'', but [[Albert R.

Jaws was intended to be a villain against Bond to the bitter end, but director Lewis Gilbert stated on the DVD documentary that he received so much fan mail from small children saying \"Why can't Jaws be a goodie not a baddie\", that as a result he was persuaded to gradually transform Jaws into Bond's ally by the end of the film.<ref name=\"Inside Moonraker\"/>\n\nOriginally Jaws's girlfriend was going to be portrayed as even more massive than him, but Kiel insisted on a rewrite.<ref name=\":0\" /> Diminutive French actress [[Blanche Ravalec]], who had recently begun her career with minor roles in French films such as [[Michel Lang]]'s ''[[Holiday Hotel]]'' (1978) and [[Claude Sautet]]'s ''[[A Simple Story (1978 film)|A Simple Story]]'' (1978), was cast as the bespectacled Dolly, the girlfriend of Jaws.

The main shooting was switched from the usual [[007 Stage]] at the Pinewood Studios to France, because of the high taxation in Britain at the time. Only the cable car interiors and space battle exteriors were filmed at Pinewood.

The skydiving sequence was coordinated by Don Calvedt under the supervision of second unit director [[John Glen (director)|John Glen]] and was shot above [[Lake Berryessa]] in northern California. As Calvedt and skydiving champion B.J. Worth developed the equipment for the scene, which included a {{convert|1|in|mm|adj=mid|-thick}} parachute pack that could be concealed beneath the suit to give the impression of the missing parachute, and equipment to prevent the freefalling cameraman from suffering whiplash while opening his parachute, they brought in stuntman Jake Lombard to test it all. Lombard eventually played Bond in the scene, with Worth as the pilot from whom Bond takes a parachute, and Ron Luginbill as Jaws. Both Lombard and Worth became regular members of the stunt team for aerial sequences in later Bond films.<ref name=\"Inside Moonraker\"/><ref name=freefall>{{cite video|title=Learning to Freefall|format=DVD|publisher=MGM|url=http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/778849231}}</ref><ref>{{cite video|title=Double O Stunts|format=DVD|publisher=MGM|url=http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/778849231}}</ref> When the stuntmen opened their parachutes at the end of every shoot, custom-sewn [[velcro]] costume seams separated to allow the hidden parachutes to open.<ref name=\"DVD booklet\"/> The skydiver cinematographer used a lightweight [[Panavision]] experimental plastic anamorphic lens, bought from an old pawn shop in Paris, which he had adapted, and attached to his helmet to shoot the entire sequence.
