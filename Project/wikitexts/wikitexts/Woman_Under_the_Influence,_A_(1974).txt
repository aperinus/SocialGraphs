The story follows a woman ([[Gena Rowlands]]) whose unusual behavior leads to conflict with her [[blue-collar]] husband ([[Peter Falk]]) and family.<ref>[https://www.newyorker.com/culture/richard-brody/seeing-john-cassavetes Seeing John Cassavetes|The New Yorker]</ref> It received two [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nominations, for Best Actress<ref>[https://www.oscars.org/governors-awards/2015/gena-rowlands Gene Rowlands|Oscars.org]</ref> and Best Director.<ref>[https://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/1975 1975|Oscars.org]</ref>\n\nIn 1990, the film was selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\", one of the first fifty films to be so honored.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Gamarekian|first=Barbara|last2=Times|first2=Special To the New York|date=1990-10-19|title=Library of Congress Adds 25 Titles to National Film Registry|language=en-US|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/10/19/movies/library-of-congress-adds-25-titles-to-national-film-registry.html|access-date=2020-05-15|issn=0362-4331}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Complete National Film Registry Listing |url=https://www.loc.gov/programs/national-film-preservation-board/film-registry/complete-national-film-registry-listing/|website=Library of Congress|access-date=2020-05-15}}</ref>\n\n== Plot ==\nMabel Longhetti, a [[Los Angeles]] housewife and mother, sends her three children to spend the night with her mother-in-law but is extremely hesitant to do so. She is a heavy drinker and exhibits strange behavior. That night, she meets a man at a bar and spends the night with him. She wakes up the next morning seemingly confused and briefly argues with him before he leaves. Her construction foreman husband, Nick, argues with his crew over bringing them to his house, saying he is ashamed of his 'crazy' wife. He succumbs to their cajoling and brings them over without being able to call Mabel beforehand. She makes everyone spaghetti, which Nick seems strangely critical of. The meal is superficially pleasant, then sours once Nick snaps at Mabel for flirting and dancing with the men.\n\nMabel's strange mannerisms and increasingly odd behavior continue to be a source of concern for Nick. She hosts a birthday party, but one of the child's parents becomes disturbed by her behavior and is reluctant to leave his children alone with her, asking if she's been drinking. When Nick comes home, he gets into a fistfight with the child's father, who then leaves with his children. Nick also angrily slaps Mabel in front of the children. He brings a doctor to evaluate her mental health. Mabel grows increasingly angry and suspicious and Nick fights off the doctor when he attempts to sedate her. Convinced she has become a threat to herself and others, the doctor [[Involuntary commitment|institutionalizes]] her.\n\nNick returns to work and is annoyed by the workers' interest in Mabel's situation. He gets into an altercation with a worker named Eddie, who falls down a hill and is severely injured. He picks up the children from school in the middle of the day to go to the beach and allows them to sip his beer, proving himself to be an equally unsuitable parental figure.\n\nSix months later, Nick plans a large surprise welcome home party for Mabel's return from the institution. However, his mother points out that this may be overwhelming for her. Nick overreacts by sending off all of the non-family guests with screams and shouts. When Mabel arrives, she is apprehensive and quiet, in great contrast to her former outgoing and eccentric personality. Nick tries to make her feel comfortable, but to no avail. The evening degenerates in yet another emotional and psychologically taxing event for Mabel. She reveals she underwent [[electroshock therapy]] in the mental hospital and becomes increasingly distraught.\n\nAfter the guests leave, Mabel has a breakdown and cuts herself. When she stands on a sofa and refuses to come down, Nick slaps her and causes her to fall. She appears to recover somewhat and puts the kids to bed while they express their love for her. Nick and Mabel prepare their bed together as the credits roll.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Gena Rowlands]] as Mabel Longhetti \n* [[Peter Falk]] as Nick Longhetti\n* [[Fred Draper]] as George Mortensen\n* [[Lady Rowlands]] as Martha Mortensen\n* [[Katherine Cassavetes]] as Margaret Longhetti\n* [[Matthew Laborteaux]] as Angelo Longhetti\n* Matthew Cassel as Tony Longhetti\n* Christina Grisanti as Maria Longhetti\n\n== Production ==\nJohn Cassavetes was inspired to write ''A Woman Under the Influence'' when his wife [[Gena Rowlands]] expressed a desire to appear in a play about the difficulties faced by contemporary women. His completed script was so intense and emotional she knew she would be unable to perform it eight times a week, so he decided to adapt it for the screen. When he tried to raise funding for the project, he was told \"No one wants to see a crazy, middle-aged dame.\"<ref name=TCM>[http://www.tcm.com/thismonth/article.jsp?cid=138056&mainArticleId=138051 Turner Classic Movies]</ref>\n\nLacking studio financing, Cassavetes mortgaged his house and borrowed from family and friends, one of whom was [[Peter Falk]], who liked the screenplay so much he invested $500,000 in the project.<ref name=\"TCM\" /> The crew consisted of professionals and students from the [[American Film Institute]], where Cassavetes was serving as the first \"filmmaker in residence\" at their Center for Advanced Film Studies. Working with a limited budget forced him to shoot scenes in a real house near [[Hollywood Boulevard]], and Rowlands was responsible for her own hairstyling and makeup.<ref name=\"TCM\" />\n\nUpon completion of the film, Cassavetes was unable to find a distributor, so he personally called theater owners and asked them to run the film. According to college student Jeff Lipsky, who was hired to help distribute the film, \"It was the first time in the history of motion pictures that an independent film was distributed without the use of a nationwide system of sub-distributors.\" It was booked into art houses and shown on college campuses, where Cassavetes and Falk discussed it with the audience.<ref name=\"TCM\" /> It was shown at the [[San Sebasti\u00e1n Film Festival]], where Rowlands was named Best Actress and Cassavetes won the Silver Shell Award for Best Director, and the [[New York Film Festival]], where it captured the attention of film critics like [[Rex Reed]]. When [[Richard Dreyfuss]] appeared on ''[[The Mike Douglas Show]]'' with Peter Falk, he described the film as \"the most incredible, disturbing, scary, brilliant, dark, sad, depressing movie\" and added \"I went crazy. I went home and vomited,\" which prompted curious audiences to seek out the film capable of making Dreyfuss (who is himself bipolar) ill.<ref name=\"TCM\" />\n\n== Critical reception ==\nOn [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film has an approval rating of 91% based on 32 reviews, with a rating average of 8.1/10. The website\u2019s critical consensus reads: \"Electrified by searing performances from Gena Rowlands and Peter Falk, ''A Woman Under the Influence'' finds pioneering independent filmmaker John Cassavetes working at his artistic peak.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/woman_under_the_influence/ |title=Rotten Tomatoes |access-date=2022-10-22}}</ref>\n\n[[Nora Sayre]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' observed \"Miss Rowlands unleashes an extraordinary characterization....The actress\u2019s style of performing sometimes shows a kinship with that of the early [[Kim Stanley]] or the recent [[Joanne Woodward]], but the notes of desperation are emphatically her own....Peter Falk gives a rousing performance...and the children are very well directed. But the movie didn't need to be 2 hours and 35 minutes long: there's too much small talk, which doesn't really reveal character. Still, the most frightening scenes are extremely compelling, and this is a thoughtful film that does prompt serious discussion.\"<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9402E6D7143DE63BBC4C52DFB667838F669EDE ''The New York Times'' review]</ref>\n\n[[Roger Ebert]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' rated the film four out of four stars and called it \"terribly complicated, involved and fascinating \u2013 a revelation.\" He added \"The characters are larger than life (although not less convincing because of that), and their loves and rages, their fights and moments of tenderness, exist at exhausting levels of emotion. [...] Cassavetes is strongest as a writer and filmmaker at creating specific characters and then sticking with them through long, painful, uncompromising scenes until we know them well enough to read them, to predict what they'll do next and even to begin to understand why.\"<ref>[http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/a-woman-under-the-influence-1974 ''Chicago Sun-Times'' review]</ref> Ebert later added the film to his \"Great Movies\" list, in which he called the film \"perhaps the greatest of Cassavetes' films.\"<ref>[http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/great-movie-a-woman-under-the-influence-1974 Ebert 1998 review]</ref>\n\n''[[Time Out London]]'' wrote \"The brilliance of the film lies in its sympathetic and humorous exposure of social structure. Rowlands unfortunately overdoes the manic psychosis at times, and lapses into a [[melodrama]]tic style which is unconvincing and unsympathetic; but Falk is persuasively insane as the husband; and the result is an astonishing, compulsive film, directed with a crackling energy.\"<ref>[http://www.timeout.com/film/reviews/64768/A_Woman_Under_the_Influence.html ''Time Out London'' review] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100108152211/http://www.timeout.com/film/reviews/64768/A_Woman_Under_the_Influence.html |date=January 8, 2010 }}</ref>\n\n''[[TV Guide]]'' rated the film four out of four stars, calling it \"tough-minded\" and \"moving\" and \"an insightful essay on sexual politics.\"<ref>[http://movies.tvguide.com/woman-influence/review/115465 ''TV Guide'' review]</ref>\n\nIn [[Sight & Sound|''Sight and Sound''<nowiki/>'s]] 2012 poll on the greatest films of all time, the film placed 59th in the directors' poll and 144th in the critics' poll.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Votes for A Woman under the Influence (1974) {{!}} BFI|url=https://www2.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b6bb2414d/sightandsoundpoll2012|access-date=2021-03-25|website=www2.bfi.org.uk}}</ref> In 2015, the BBC named ''A Woman Under the Influence'' the 31st greatest American film ever made.<ref name=bbc>[http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20150720-the-100-greatest-american-films \"The 100 Greatest American Films\"], [[bbc.com]], July 20, 2015</ref>\n\n[[Pauline Kael]] of ''[[The New Yorker]]'',<ref>[https://www.thecrimson.com/article/1975/3/6/the-obsessed-ppauline-kael-reviewed-john/ The Obsessed|News|The Harvard Crimson]</ref> however, condemned the film as a \"didactic illustration of [[R.D.
