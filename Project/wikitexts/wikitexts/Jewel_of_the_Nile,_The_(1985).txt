It is the [[sequel]] to the 1984 action-adventure romantic comedy film ''[[Romancing the Stone]]''.\n\nLike ''Romancing the Stone'', the opening scene takes place in one of Joan's novels. This time, instead of Jesse and Angelina in Joan's wild-west scenario, Joan and Jack are about to be [[married]] when pirates attack their [[ship]]. ''The Jewel of the Nile'' sends its characters off on a new adventure in a fictional African desert, in an effort to find the fabled \"Jewel of the [[Nile]]\".\n\nThe song performed by [[Billy Ocean]], \"[[When the Going Gets Tough, the Tough Get Going (song)|When the Going Gets Tough, the Tough Get Going]]\", became a major international hit, reaching #1 in the UK and #2 in the US.<ref name=\"Feaster\"/>{{TOC limit|limit=2}}\n\n==Plot==\nSix months after the events in ''Romancing the Stone'', Joan Wilder's ([[Kathleen Turner]]) and Jack Colton's ([[Michael Douglas]]) romance has grown stale. While moored at a port in the [[Southern France|South of France]], Joan, suffering [[writer's block]], wants to return to New York, while Jack prefers aimlessly sailing the world on his boat, the ''Angelina''. At a book signing engagement, Joan meets Omar Khalifa ([[Spiros Foc\u00e1s]]), a charming [[Arabs|Arab]] ruler who wants Joan to write his biography.\n\nJoan accepts and leaves with Omar over Jack's protests. Jack later runs into Ralph ([[Danny DeVito]]), the swindler from Jack and Joan's previous adventure in [[Colombia]], who demands Jack turn over the stone Jack and Joan found. Shortly after, an Arab, Tarak (Paul David Magid), informs Jack about Omar's true intentions and claims that Omar has the \"Jewel of the Nile\"; just as Tarak finishes his explanations, the ''Angelina'' explodes from a bomb set by one of Omar's men. Ralph and Jack team up to find Joan and the fabled jewel.\n\nJoan soon discovers that Omar is a brutal dictator rather than the enlightened ruler he claimed will unite the Arab world. In the palace jail, Joan encounters ''Al-Julhara'' ([[Avner the Eccentric|Avner Eisenberg]]), a holy man who is, in fact, the \"Jewel of the Nile\" and whom Omar fears.{{#tag:ref|Al-Julhara in [[Arabic]]|group=Note}} Al-Julhara tells Joan that Omar plans to declare himself ruler of all of the Arab world at a ceremony in the city of Kadir.\n\nRealizing that Al-Julhara is the only one who can stop Omar, Joan decides to escort him to Kadir herself. The pair escape and find Jack, and they flee into the desert in Omar's hijacked [[General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon|F-16]] fighter jet. Ralph is captured by Tarak's rebel [[Sufism|Sufi]] tribe who are sworn to protect the Jewel so he can fulfill his people's destiny.\n\nAfter encountering a [[Nubians|Nubian]] mountain tribe, Joan and Jack's romance is rekindled. Joan tells Jack that the jewel is not a gem stone but Al-Julhara. In Kadir, Omar intends to use a smoke-and-mirror special effect provided by a British rock promoter to convince onlookers that he is the prophet who will unite the Arab world. Jack, Joan, and Al-Julhara arrive to expose Omar but are captured. Omar suspends Jack and Joan with ropes over a deep pit (a scenario taken from Joan's biggest-selling novel, ''The Savage Secret'') while Al-Julhara is in a stockade. Ralph, along with the Sufi tribe, arrives in time to rescue the three prisoners.\n\nAs Omar takes center stage to address the Arab people, Jack and Joan disrupt the ceremony while the Sufi battle Omar's guards. A fire breaks out, engulfing Omar's stage. Jack and Joan are separated, and Omar corners Joan atop the burning scaffolding. Ralph, using a giant crane, helps Jack reach Joan in the nick of time; he kicks Omar over the side and down into the flames, killing him. Al-Julhara rises and safely walks through the blazing inferno, fulfilling the prophecy that he is the true spiritual leader.\n\nThe following day, Jack and Joan are married by Al-Julhara. While Ralph is genuinely happy for Jack and Joan, he laments once again having gained nothing for his efforts, but Tarak acknowledges that he is a true Sufi friend and presents him with a jeweled dagger as Jack and Joan happily sail away down the Nile.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Michael Douglas]] as Jack Colton\n* [[Kathleen Turner]] as Joan Wilder Colton\n* [[Danny DeVito]] as Ralph\n* [[Spiros Foc\u00e1s]] as Omar Khalifa\n* [[Avner the Eccentric|Avner Eisenberg]] as Al-Julhara\n* Hamid Fillali as Rachid\n* [[Daniel Peacock]] as Rock Promoter\n* [[Holland Taylor]] as Gloria Horne\n* [[Guy Cuevas]] as Le Vasseur\n* Peter DePalma as Missionary (as Peter De Palma)\n* Mark Daly Richards as Pirate\n* [[The Flying Karamazov Brothers]]\n:* Paul David Magid as Tarak\n:* Howard Jay Patterson as Barak\n:* Randall Edwin Nelson as Karak\n:* Samuel Ross Williams as Arak\n:* Timothy Daniel Furst as Sarak\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\nWith a $21 million budget, principal photography began April 22, 1985 with filming wrapped on July 25, 1985.<ref name=\"Notes\">[http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/79756/Jewel-of-the-Nile/misc-notes.html \"Notes: 'The Jewel of the Nile'.\"] ''Turner Classic Movies''.

After one massive night scene that was hours in setup, and cast and crew in place, it was only then that someone noticed that there was no film in the cameras.
