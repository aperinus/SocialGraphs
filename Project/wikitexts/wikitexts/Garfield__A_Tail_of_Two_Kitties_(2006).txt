It is the [[sequel]] to the 2004 film ''[[Garfield: The Movie]]''. The film stars [[Breckin Meyer]] and [[Jennifer Love Hewitt]] reprising their roles as [[Jon Arbuckle]] and [[Dr. Liz Wilson]] respectively, and [[Bill Murray]] reprising his role as the voice of Garfield. New cast members include [[Billy Connolly]], [[Ian Abercrombie]], [[Roger Rees]], [[Lucy Davis]] and [[Oliver Muirhead]] in live-action roles and [[Tim Curry]], [[Bob Hoskins]], [[Rhys Ifans]], [[Vinnie Jones]], [[Joe Pasquale]], [[Richard E. Grant]], and [[Jane Leeves]] as the voices of the film's new animal characters. In the film, Garfield, Odie, Liz and Jon travel to the United Kingdom, where Prince, another cat that [[doppelganger|looks exactly]] like Garfield, is ruling over a castle after the death of his owner. His reign is soon jeopardized by an evil aristocrat, who plans to remodel the castle into condominiums, destroy the estate, and get rid of Prince.\n\nProduced by [[Davis Entertainment|Davis Entertainment Company]] for [[20th Century Fox]], it was released in the United States on June 16, 2006. Although it became a commercial success, grossing $143 million against its $60 million budget, like [[Garfield: The Movie|its predecessor]], the film also received generally negative reviews from critics. A video game [[Garfield: A Tail of Two Kitties (video game)|of the same name]] was developed by [[The Game Factory]].\n\n==Plot==\nTwo years after [[Garfield: The Movie|the events of the first film]], Jon Arbuckle plans to propose to his girlfriend, veterinarian Dr. Elizabeth \"Liz\" Wilson, who is going on a business trip to [[London]]. Jon follows Liz to the United Kingdom as a surprise; after escaping from a kennel, Jon's two pets, Garfield and Odie, sneak into Jon's luggage and join him on the trip. Garfield and Odie break out of the hotel room due to boredom, and subsequently get lost in the streets of London.\n\nMeanwhile, at Carlyle Castle in the English countryside, the late Lady Eleanor Carlyle's will is read by the solicitors, Mr. Hobbs, Mr. Greene and Mrs. Whitney. She bequeaths Carlyle Castle to Prince XII, her beloved cat who lives a strong life of luxury, and bears a strong resemblance to Garfield. This enrages the Lady's greedy nephew, Lord Manfred Dargis, who will now only receive a stipend of \u00a350 a week and inherit the grand estate once Prince passes away. Lord Dargis traps Prince in a picnic basket and throws him into the river. Jon finds Prince climbing out of a drain and takes him to the hotel after mistaking him for Garfield, while Prince's butler, Smithee, finds Garfield in the street and takes him to Carlyle Castle after mistaking him for Prince.\n\nIn the grand estate, Garfield receives a great deal of special treatment, including a butler and a group of four-legged followers, lead by Prince's loyal bulldog servant, Winston. Winston convinces the animals to tolerate and protect Garfield in order to prevent Lord Dargis from getting his hands on the estate, which he plans to turn into a SPA resort by demolishing the area and slaughtering the animals. With Garfield's presence, Dargis thinks Prince has returned and fears that the solicitors will not sign the estate over for him. He makes many attempts to kill Garfield, but fails every time due to the animals interfering. Garfield befriends the animals and teaches them how to make lasagna while Prince learns how to be an ordinary pet. Despite both of them enjoying their new lifestyles, they soon begin to missing their old lives, Garfield especially after overhearing the animals complaining about his slobby and selfish attitude for a royal cat.\n\nEventually, Garfield and Prince meet each other for the first time after both attempting to return to their old lives. Garfield, having understand of what is at stake for Prince and his subjects, convinces them to help him defeat Dargis. Jon and Odie discover the mix-up and go to the castle, which Liz is coincidentally visiting. \nGarfield and Prince taunt Dargis, whose plan is exposed, and the two cats are seen by the solicitors. Dargis barges in, holding a [[blunderbuss]] and threatening the solicitors if they do not sign the papers giving him ownership of the estate while also taking Liz hostage. Jon attempts to force Dargis to release Liz by holding a crossbow at him, only for Dargis to threaten to kill Jon for getting involved in the first place. Garfield and Prince, with the help of Odie and Jon, save the day while Smithee alerts the authorities and Dargis is arrested for his crimes. Garfield, who had been trying to stop Jon from proposing to Liz, has a change of heart: he helps Jon propose to Liz, and she accepts.\n\n==Cast==\n===Live action===\n* [[Breckin Meyer]] as [[Jon Arbuckle]], the owner of [[Garfield (character)|Garfield]] and [[Odie]].\n* [[Jennifer Love Hewitt]] as [[Dr. Liz Wilson]], Jon's veterinarian girlfriend/fianc\u00e9e.\n* [[Billy Connolly]] as Lord Manfred Dargis, an evil lord who wants to remodel Carlyle Castle into condominiums.\n* [[Ian Abercrombie]] as Smithee, the Carlyle Castle butler.\n* [[Roger Rees]] as Mr. Hobbs, a solicitor.\n* [[Lucy Davis]] as Abby Westminister, a solicitor.\n* [[Jane Carr]] as Mrs. Whitney, a solicitor.\n* [[Oliver Muirhead]] as Mr. Greene, a solicitor.\n* [[Ben Falcone]] as an American tourist.\n\n===Voice cast===\n* [[Bill Murray]] as [[Garfield (character)|Garfield]], an orange [[tabby cat]] who loves lasagna and has a lazy attitude.\n* [[Tim Curry]] as Prince XII, an English cat who is a twin counterpart of Garfield.\n* [[Bob Hoskins]] as Winston, an [[English bulldog]] who is Prince's servant.\n* [[Rhys Ifans]] as McBunny, a Scottish-accented [[Belgian hare]].\n* [[Vinnie Jones]] as Rommel, a [[rottweiler]] who is Lord Dargis's former companion.\n* [[Jim Piddock]] as Bolero, a [[Spanish Fighting Bull]].\n* [[Joe Pasquale]] as Claudius, a [[rat]].\n* [[Greg Ellis (actor)|Greg Ellis]] as Nigel, a [[ferret]].\n* [[Richard E.
