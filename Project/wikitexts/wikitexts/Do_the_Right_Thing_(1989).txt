It stars Lee, [[Danny Aiello]], [[Ossie Davis]], [[Ruby Dee]], [[Richard Edson]], [[Giancarlo Esposito]], [[Bill Nunn]], [[John Turturro]], and [[Samuel L. Jackson]], and is the feature film debut of [[Martin Lawrence]] and [[Rosie Perez]]. The story explores a [[Brooklyn]] neighborhood's simmering [[Ethnic conflict|racial tension]] between its [[African Americans|African-American]] residents and the [[Italian Americans|Italian-American]] owners of a local pizzeria, culminating in tragedy and violence on a hot summer day.\n\nThe film was a critical and commercial success and received numerous accolades, including [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nominations for [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay|Best Original Screenplay]] and [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Supporting Actor]] for Aiello's portrayal of Sal the pizzeria owner. It is often listed among the [[List of films considered the best|greatest films of all time]].<ref>[http://www.afi.com/100years/movies10.aspx \"AFI's 100 Years... 100 Movies (10th Anniversary Edition)\"].

As of July 21, 2021, the word count for this plot summary is 700 words. -->\nTwenty-five-year-old Mookie lives in [[Bedford\u2013Stuyvesant]] with his sister Jade, has a toddler son named Hector with his girlfriend Tina, and works as a delivery man at a local pizzeria that has been owned and operated for 25 years by Sal, an [[Italian-American]] who lives in [[Bensonhurst, Brooklyn|Bensonhurst]]. Sal's racist eldest son Pino is antagonistic towards Mookie, clashing with both his father, who refuses to move his business out of the [[African-American neighborhood|majority African-American]] neighborhood, and his younger brother Vito, who is friendly with Mookie.\n\nMany distinctive residents are introduced, including friendly drunk Da Mayor; Mother Sister, who watches the neighborhood from her [[brownstone]]; [[Radio Raheem]], who blasts [[Public Enemy (group)|Public Enemy]]'s \"[[Fight the Power (Public Enemy song)|Fight the Power]]\" on his [[boombox]] wherever he goes; and Smiley, a [[mentally disabled]] man who meanders around the neighborhood trying to sell hand-colored pictures of [[Malcolm X]] and [[Martin Luther King Jr.]]\n\nAt Sal's, Mookie's friend Buggin' Out questions Sal about his \"Wall of Fame\", decorated with photos of famous Italian-Americans, and demands that Sal put up pictures of Black celebrities since the pizzeria is in a Black neighborhood. Sal replies that it is his business, and that he can have whoever he wants on the wall. Buggin' Out attempts to start boycotting the pizzeria.\n\nDuring the day, local teenagers open a fire hydrant and douse the other neighbors to beat the heat wave before officers Mark Ponte and Gary Long intervene. After a phone call, Mookie and Pino debate race. Mookie confronts Pino about his contempt towards African-Americans, although Pino's favorite celebrities are Black. Various characters express racial insults: Mookie against Italians, Pino against African-Americans, Latino Stevie against Koreans, white officer Gary Long against Puerto Ricans, and Korean store owner Sonny against Jews. Pino expresses his hatred for African-Americans to Sal, who insists on staying in the neighborhood.\n\n[[File:Radio Raheem's Boombox.jpg|thumb|Radio Raheem's boombox as seen in \"Do the Right Thing\".  Image courtesy of Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture.]]That night, Buggin' Out, Radio Raheem, and Smiley march into Sal's and demand that Sal change the Wall of Fame. Sal demands that Radio Raheem turn his boombox off, but he refuses. Buggin' Out calls Sal and his sons \"[[Anti-Italianism|Guinea bastards]]\" and threatens to shutter the pizzeria until they change the Wall of Fame. An angered Sal calls Buggin' Out a \"[[nigger]]\" and destroys Raheem's boombox with a bat. Raheem attacks Sal, igniting a fight that spills out into the street and attracts a crowd. While Raheem is strangling Sal, the police arrive, including Officer Long and Ponte from earlier in the movie, who break up the fight, and apprehend Raheem and Buggin' Out. As the officers attempt to restrain an enraged Raheem, suddenly Long throws Raheem in a chokehold with his nightstick. Despite the pleas of his partner Ponte and onlookers to stop, Long instead tightens his chokehold on Raheem, killing him. Realizing their error, the officers place his body in the back of a [[police car]] and drive off.\n\nThe onlookers, devastated and enraged about Radio Raheem's death, blame Sal and his sons. Da Mayor tries to convince the crowd that Sal did not cause his death but the crowd remains stationary. In a brief fit of anger and grief, Mookie grabs a trash can and throws it through the window of Sal's pizzeria, sparking the crowd to rush into and destroy the pizzeria. Smiley sets the building on fire, and Da Mayor pulls Sal and his sons away from the mob, which then turns towards Sonny's store, preparing to destroy it too. However, a panicked Sonny eventually dissuades the group. The police return to the site, along with firemen and riot patrols to extinguish the fire and disperse the crowd. After they issue a warning, the firefighters turn their hoses on the rioters, leading to more fighting and arrests, while Mookie and Jade watch in shock from the curb. Smiley wanders back into the smoldering building and hangs one of his pictures on the remnants of Sal's Wall of Fame.\n\nThe next day, after arguing with Tina, Mookie returns to Sal. He feels that Mookie had betrayed him, but Mookie demands his weekly pay. The two men argue and cautiously reconcile, and Sal finally pays Mookie. Local DJ Mister Se\u00f1or Love Daddy dedicates a song to Radio Raheem.\n\nBefore the credits, two quotations expressing different views about violence, one by Martin Luther King and one by Malcolm X, appear, followed by a photograph of both leaders shaking hands.  Lee then dedicates the film to the families of six victims of brutality or racial violence: [[Eleanor Bumpurs]], [[Michael Griffith (manslaughter victim)|Michael Griffith]], Arthur Miller Jr., [[Edmund Perry]], Yvonne Smallwood, and [[Death of Michael Stewart|Michael Stewart]].\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Spike Lee]] as Mookie\n* [[Danny Aiello]] as Sal\n* [[Ossie Davis]] as Da Mayor\n* [[Ruby Dee]] as Mother Sister\n* [[Giancarlo Esposito]] as Buggin' Out\n* [[Bill Nunn]] as [[Radio Raheem]]\n* [[John Turturro]] as Pino\n* [[Richard Edson]] as Vito\n* [[Roger Guenveur Smith]] as Smiley\n* [[Rosie Perez]] as Tina\n* [[Joie Lee]] as Jade\n* [[Steve White (actor)|Steve White]] as Ahmad\n* [[Martin Lawrence]] as Cee\n* [[Leonard L.

Aiello eventually played Sal and his son Rick played Gary Long, the police officer who kills Radio Raheem.

Lee originally wanted Nunn to play the role of Mister Se\u00f1or Love Daddy, but later recast him as Radio Raheem.

Perez decided to take the part because her sister lived four blocks from the set. She had never been in a film before and became upset during the filming of Radio Raheem's death scene.<ref name=ew/>\n\n===Filming===\nThe film was shot entirely on Stuyvesant Avenue between Quincy Street and Lexington Avenue in the [[Bedford\u2013Stuyvesant]] neighborhood of [[Brooklyn]]. Production designer Wynn Thomas altered the street's color scheme, using a great deal of red and orange paint to convey the sense of a heatwave. The Korean grocery store and Sal's pizzeria were built from scratch on two empty lots. The pizzeria was fully functional and the actors cooked pizzas in the ovens. During filming, the neighborhood's [[crack cocaine|crack]] dealers threatened the film crew for disturbing their business there.
