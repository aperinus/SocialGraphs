Based on the 1983 [[The Witches (novel)|book of the same name]] by [[Roald Dahl]], the story features evil [[Witchcraft|witches]] who masquerade as ordinary women, and a boy and his grandmother who must find a way to foil their plans.\n\nThe film was produced by [[The Jim Henson Company]] for [[Lorimar Television|Lorimar Film Entertainment]] as the last theatrical film to be produced by Lorimar before the company was merged into [[Warner Bros.]] in 1993. Even though Dahl disliked ''The Witches'' for its ending's differing from his source material, the film was very well received by critics, and it developed a [[cult following]] over the years.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Alfar |first1=Paolo |title=The Witches (1990): 10 Behind-The-Scenes Facts About It |url=https://screenrant.com/the-witches-1990-behind-the-scenes-facts/ |website=ScreenRant |date=October 25, 2020}}</ref>\n\n== Plot ==\nDuring a vacation with his grandmother Helga in [[Norway]], seven-year-old American boy, Luke Eveshim, is warned about witches, female [[demon]]s who immensely hate children and use various methods to destroy or transform them. Helga tells Luke that unlike ordinary women, real witches have claws instead of fingernails which they hide by wearing gloves, bald heads which they cover by wearing wigs that give them rashes, square feet with no toes which they hide by wearing sensible shoes, a purple tinge in their pupils and a powerful sense of smell which they use to sniff out children. To a witch, clean children stink of dog's droppings; the dirtier the children, the less likely she is to smell them. Helga says her childhood friend, Erica, fell victim to a witch and was [[curse]]d to spend the rest of her life trapped inside a painting, aging gradually until finally disappearing a few years earlier.\n\nAfter Luke's parents are killed in a car accident, Helga becomes Luke's legal guardian and they move to England. While playing outside in a treehouse, Luke is approached by a witch trying to lure him with a snake and a chocolate bar, so he stays in his treehouse for protection and the witch goes away. On Luke's ninth birthday, Helga falls ill with [[diabetes]]. Her doctor advises they spend the summer by the sea. At their seaside hotel in [[Bournemouth]],<ref>{{Cite web|title=The Witches - paperback|url=https://www.roalddahl.com/shop/books/the-witches--paperback|access-date=2021-12-23|website=www.roalddahl.com}}</ref> Luke meets and befriends a gluttonous but friendly boy, Bruno Jenkins. Luke unintentionally antagonizes the hotel manager, Mr. Stringer, after his pet [[Mouse|mice]] frighten his maid girlfriend. Also at the hotel is a [[Coven|convention]] of witches, masquerading as the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children. The [[Grand High Witch]], the all-powerful leader of the world's witches, is attending under the name Eva Ernst.\n\nLuke hides inside the ballroom and spies on the witches' meeting. Eva unveils her latest creation: a magic [[potion]] to turn all the world's children into mice, which will be used in confectionery products in [[Confectionery store|sweet shops]] and candy stores to be purchased using money provided by Eva. Bruno, who was given the potion earlier, is brought into the room, turns into a mouse, and flees. Luke is discovered and runs to Helga in their room but finds her resting after having a diabetes-induced dizzy spell. The witches seize Luke in the room and take him back to the ballroom, where he is forced to drink the potion and turned into a mouse before escaping. He finds Bruno and reunites with Helga, who has since recovered. Luke devises a plan to defeat the witches by sneaking into Eva's room to steal a bottle of the potion, then sneaking into the kitchen and puts it into the soup for the special RSPCC party. Luke and Helga try to get Bruno to his parents, but they do not believe her story and are frightened by the mouse.\n\nMr. Jenkins orders the soup, though Helga stops him from consuming it. The Jenkinses finally realize Bruno is a mouse when he speaks up. As the witches enter the banquet, Miss Susan Irvine, Eva's long-suffering and mistreated assistant, quits upon being banned from the celebration. The formula turns all the witches into mice, and the staff and hotel guests join in killing them, unknowingly ridding England of its witches. Amidst the chaos, Helga spots the transformed Eva and traps her under a water jug before helpfully pointing her out to Mr. Stringer, who chops her in two with a meat cleaver. She then returns Bruno to his bewildered parents. Luke and Helga return home to where Eva's trunk full of money and an address book of all witches in the United States is delivered, allowing them to plan an operation to wipe out all the witches in America. That night, Miss Irvine, now a good witch (having reformed after Eva's death), drives to Luke and Helga's house and returns Luke to human form, as well as his pet mice and glasses. She leaves to pay Bruno a visit, as Luke and Helga wave goodbye.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Anjelica Huston]] as [[Grand High Witch|Eva Ernst / The Grand High Witch]], the all-powerful leader of the world's witches.

As a gesture of conciliation, Henson offered to film two versions before he made his final choice: the book version where Luke remains a mouse, and the \"happier\" version where he is transformed back into a human. During the editing process, Dahl watched an early cut of the film with his original ending, and the final scene brought him to tears. However, Henson and Roeg decided to go with the \"happier\" ending, which resulted in Dahl stating that he would launch a publicity campaign against the film if his name was not removed from the credits. He was only dissuaded from this on the urging of Henson.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.slantmagazine.com/house/article/summer-of-90-the-witches| title=Summer of '90: The Witches| author=Louis Jordan| publisher=Slant Magazine| date=20 August 2015| access-date=24 November 2018| archive-date=29 June 2018| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180629211253/https://www.slantmagazine.com/house/article/summer-of-90-the-witches| url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n== Release ==\nThe film was slated to be distributed by [[Lorimar Television]], but when the company dissolved their theatrical distribution operation, it wound up sitting on the shelf for more than a year after filming was completed.<ref name=\"Cinefantastique\">{{cite journal | title = The Witches: Warner Bros takes Jim Henson's puppet film swan song off the shelf | journal = Cinefantastique | volume = 21| page = 22 | date = September 1990 }}</ref> The film premiered on 25 May 1990, in London and was scheduled to open the same day in the United States,<ref name=\"Cinefantastique\"/> but following Florida test screenings earlier that year [[Warner Bros.]] delayed the American release until August.<ref name=\"Cinefantastique\"/> The film took in $10,360,553 in the United States, and 266,782 in Germany.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.saltypopcorn.co.uk/charts/box-office.php?chart=19900525|title=May 25th, 1990 - May 27th, 1990|publisher=www.25thframe.co.uk|access-date=31 December 2018|archive-date=1 January 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190101002732/https://www.25thframe.co.uk/charts/chart.php?chart=19900525|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n=== Home media ===\n[[Warner Home Video]] first released the film on VHS and LaserDisc in 1991.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Witches VHS|asin=6302877571}}</ref> The second release (and first re release) was on VHS and for the first time on DVD in 1999.
