Milio) and Matthew E. Chausse and written by Ronnie Christensen and Amy Sorlie. The film is based on a story by Amy Sorlie and stars [[Halle Berry]], [[Olivier Martinez]], and [[Ralph Brown]]. The film was a critical failure and a [[box-office bomb]].\n\n==Plot==\nKate is a shark expert whose business has been failing since a shark attack killed a fellow diver under her command. Once dubbed \"the shark whisperer\", Kate is haunted by the memory of the attack and unable to get back into the water. With bills piling up and the bank about to foreclose on Kate's boat, Kate's estranged husband, Jeff, presents her with a lucrative opportunity: to lead a thrill-seeking millionaire businessman and his teenage son on a dangerous shark dive - outside the cage. Battling her self-doubts and fear, Kate accepts the proposal and sets a course for the world's deadliest feeding ground, \"Shark Alley\".\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Halle Berry]] as Kate Mathieson\n* [[Olivier Martinez]] as Jeff Mathieson\n* [[Ralph Brown]] as William Brady\n* Luke Tyler as Luke Brady\n* Mark Elderkin as Tommy Phillips\n* Sizwe Msutu as Themba\n* [[Thoko Ntshinga]] as Zukie\n\n==Production==\nProduction began in July 2010 in [[False Bay]], [[Cape Town]], [[South Africa]], and shot for six weeks on a small boat with real [[great white shark]]s. The production then moved to the UK for three weeks filming in [[Pinewood Studios]] on the underwater stage and at Black Hangar Studios on their external water tank. The soundtrack was written and performed by Mark Sayfritz.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://thefilmstage.com/trailer/dark-tide-trailer-halle-berry-becomes-shark-attack-expert/|title='Dark Tide' Trailer: Halle Berry Becomes Shark Attack Expert|last=Raup|first=Jordan|date=15 June 2011|website=The Film Stage|access-date=16 May 2019}}</ref><ref>[http://dvd-copy.com/movies/Misc/2011/Dark-Tide/1507563/summary.htm/ Dark Tide (2011) Movie/Film Bio: Shark, Diving Instructor, Diver Filme].
