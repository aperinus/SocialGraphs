The film was executive produced by [[George Lucas]] and written by [[Bob Dolman]] from a story by Lucas. The film stars [[Warwick Davis]], [[Val Kilmer]], [[Joanne Whalley]], [[Jean Marsh]], and [[Billy Barty]].\n\nLucas conceived the idea for the film in 1972, approaching Howard to direct during the [[post-production]] phase of ''[[Cocoon (film)|Cocoon]]'' in 1985. [[Bob Dolman]] was brought in to write the screenplay, coming up with seven drafts before finishing in late 1986. It was then set up at [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] and [[principal photography]] began in April 1987, finishing the following October. The majority of filming took place in [[Dinorwic quarry]] in [[Wales]] with some at [[Elstree Studios (Shenley Road)|Elstree Studios]] in [[Hertfordshire]], as well as a small section in [[New Zealand]]. [[Industrial Light & Magic]] created the visual effects sequences, which led to a revolutionary breakthrough with digital [[morphing]] technology.\n\nThe film was released in 1988 to mixed reviews from critics with some praising the special effects and character designs while some criticized the direction and plot. It grossed $137.6 million worldwide against a $35 million budget. While not the blockbuster some expected, it turned a profit based on international box office returns and strong home video and television returns. Additionally, it received two [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nominations.\n\nA [[Willow (TV series)|television series]] that will serve as a [[sequel]] to the film is scheduled to be released in [[Disney+]] on November 30, 2022.\n\n==Plot==\nTo prevent the fulfillment of a prophecy that a child with a special [[runes|rune]] birthmark will bring about her downfall, the evil sorceress Queen Bavmorda of Nockmaar imprisons all pregnant women in her domain. The foretold child is born, but her mother persuades the [[midwife]] to smuggle the baby out of the castle. Bavmorda executes the mother and sends her [[wolf]]-like Nockmaar hounds after the midwife. After evading the hounds for months, the midwife is forced to set the baby adrift on a grass raft in a river before she is killed by the dogs. Bavmorda then sends her daughter, Sorsha, and an army, led by General Kael, to hunt down the baby.\n\nSome distance downriver, a village of Nelwyn ([[dwarfism|little people]]) prepares for a festival. The baby is found by the children of farmer and aspiring sorcerer Willow Ufgood, and his family takes her in and comes to love her. At the festival, a Nockmaar hound arrives and attacks all the cradles it finds. After the Nelwyn warriors kill it, Willow presents the baby to the village leader, the High Aldwin, as the probable reason for the dog's appearance. The High Aldwin orders the baby must return to a Daikini (tall people) family, so Willow and a party of volunteers set out to find one.\n\nAt a [[intersection (road)|crossroads]], they find Madmartigan, a [[mercenary]] trapped in a [[Gibbeting|crow's cage]], who offers to take the baby in exchange for his freedom. The majority of the Nelwyn think they should give the baby to him, but Willow and his friend Meegosh refuse, causing the others to abandon them and go home. After meeting Madmartigan's old comrade Airk, on his way with an army to attack Bavmorda, Willow relents and agrees to Madmartigan's terms.\n\nOn the way home, Willow and Meegosh discover that some [[brownie (folklore)|brownies]] have stolen the baby, and pursue them. They are captured by the brownies, but Fairy Queen Cherlindrea frees them and explains the baby is Elora Danan, the foretold Princess of Tir Asleen. She gives Willow a magic wand and sends him to find Fin Raziel, an aging enchantress.\n\nWillow sends Meegosh home, and continues the journey in the company of two of the brownies, Franjean and Rool. On the way, he re-encounters Madmartigan, who is disguising himself as a woman to hide from his mistress's husband Llug. Sorsha and Kael's army arrives, but Madmartigan is revealed as a man to Llug, who starts a brawl which helps Willow and Madmartigan escape with the baby.\n\nMadmartigan, seemingly reluctantly, leads Willow to the lake where Raziel lives. They are captured soon thereafter, along with Raziel, who has been turned into a [[brushtail possum]] by Bavmorda. Willow tries to restore her, but he turns her into a [[rook (bird)|rook]].\n\nFranjean accidentally doses Madmartigan with Love Potion. Madmartigan declares undying love for Sorsha, but she is skeptical. Willow's party flees, finding Airk and the remnants of his army after Bavmorda defeated them. When the Nockmaar army pursues, Madmartigan takes Sorsha hostage, and they flee once more. However, Sorsha escapes.\n\nWillow's party arrives at Tir Asleen, only to find it cursed and overrun with [[troll]]s. Kael's army arrives, and Madmartigan and Willow attempt to fend them off. Sorsha, realizing she has fallen in love with Madmartigan, defects to his side. Willow accidentally turns a troll into a two-headed Eborsisk monster with the wand, and in the chaos that ensues, Kael kidnaps Elora and takes her back to Nockmaar Castle. Bavmorda orders preparation of a ritual to banish Elora from the world forever.\n\nAirk's army arrives and Willow's party joins them, but Bavmorda casts a spell to turn them all to pigs. Willow uses the wand to protect himself before finally restoring Raziel to her humanoid form. She breaks Bavmorda's spell over the army, and they trick their way into the castle. Kael slays Airk, but Madmartigan avenges him, and Willow, Sorsha, and Raziel confront Bavmorda in the ritual chamber. After a grueling fight, Bavmorda incapacitates Raziel and Sorsha. Willow uses [[sleight of hand|sleight-of-hand]] to trick Bavmorda into thinking he has made Elora disappear. Bavmorda moves to attack him, but, unnerved, accidentally completes the ritual in the process, banishing herself.\n\nAt the restored Tir Asleen, Willow is gifted a spellbook by Raziel. Leaving Elora in the care of Madmartigan and Sorsha, Willow returns home to his village and family in triumph.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Warwick Davis]] as Willow Ufgood, a Nelwyn ([[Dwarf (folklore)|dwarf]]) farmer and aspiring [[Magician (fantasy)|sorcerer]].\n*[[Val Kilmer]] as Madmartigan, a boastful [[mercenary]] swordsman who helps Willow on his quest.\n*Kate and Ruth Greenfield and Rebecca Bearman as [[Elora Danan]], an infant princess who is prophesied to bring about Bavmorda's downfall.\n*[[Joanne Whalley]] as Sorsha, Bavmorda's warrior daughter.\n*[[Jean Marsh]] as Bavmorda, the villainous queen of Nockmaar, a powerful black sorceress and the mother of Sorsha.\n*[[Patricia Hayes]] as Fin Raziel, the aging sorceress who is turned into a [[brushtail possum]] due to a curse from Bavmorda.\n*[[Billy Barty]] as High Aldwin, the Nelwyn wizard who commissions Willow to go on his journey.\n*[[Pat Roach]] as Kael, the villainous associate of Bavmorda and high commander of her army.\n*[[Gavan O'Herlihy]] as Airk Thaughbaer, the military commander of the destroyed kingdom of Galladoorn who shares a mixed friendship with Madmartigan.\n*Maria Holv\u00f6e as Cherlindrea, the fairy queen who resides in the forest and updates Willow on the importance of his quest.\n*[[Kevin Pollak]] and [[Rick Overton]] as Rool and Franjean, a [[Brownie (folklore)|brownie]] duo who also serve as [[comic relief]] in Willow's journey.\n*[[David J.

Howard nominated [[Bob Dolman]] to write the screenplay based on Lucas's story. Dolman had worked with him on a 1983 [[television pilot]] called ''Little Shots'' that had not resulted in a series, and Lucas admired Dolman's work on the [[Situation comedy|sitcom]] ''[[WKRP in Cincinnati]]''.<ref name=Howard/>\n\nDolman joined Howard and Lucas at [[Skywalker Ranch]] for a series of lengthy story conferences, and wrote seven drafts of his script between the spring and fall of 1986.<ref name=Howard>Hearn, p.154-155</ref> [[Pre-production]] began in late 1986. Various major film studios turned down the chance to distribute and cofinance it with [[Lucasfilm]] because they believed the fantasy genre was unsuccessful.

The script called for Willow to restore Fin Raziel (Patricia Hayes) from a goat to her human form. Willow recites what he thinks is the appropriate spell, but turns the goat into an ostrich, a peacock, a tortoise and, finally, a tiger, before returning her to normal. I.L.M. supervisor [[Dennis Muren]] considered using CGI [[stop-motion]] animation for the scene.<ref>Baxter, p.367</ref> He also explained that another traditional and practical way in the late 1980s to execute this sequence would have been through the use of an [[optical printer|optical dissolve]] with [[cutaway (filmmaking)|cutaway]]s at various stages.<ref name=digital/>\n\nMuren found both stop motion and optical effects to be too technically challenging and decided that the transformation scene would be a perfect opportunity for ILM to create advances with digital [[morphing]] technology. He proposed filming each animal, and the actress [[Body double|doubling]] for Hayes, and then feeding the images into a computer program developed by Doug Smythe.<ref name=digital/> The program would then create a smooth transition from one stage to another before outputting the result back onto film.
