An adaptation of [[John Grisham|John Grisham's]] 1996 novel ''[[The Runaway Jury]]'',<ref>[https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9A06E2D6173EF934A25753C1A9659C8B63 \"Runaway Jury (2003) Film Review; Courtroom Confrontation With Lots of Star Power\"] ''[[The New York Times]]''</ref> the film pits lawyer Wendell Rohr (Hoffman) against shady jury consultant Rankin Fitch (Hackman), who uses unlawful means to stack the jury with people sympathetic to the defense. Meanwhile, a high-stakes cat-and-mouse game begins when juror Nicholas Easter (Cusack) and his girlfriend Marlee (Weisz) appear to be able to sway the jury into delivering any verdict they want in a trial against a gun manufacturer. The film was released October 17, 2003.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 to 700 words. -->\nIn [[New Orleans]], an ex-employee perpetrates a mass shooting with a [[machine pistol]] at a stock brokerage firm. 11 people are killed and several others wounded in the incident. Among the dead is Jacob Wood. Two years later, with attorney Wendell Rohr, Jacob's widow Celeste takes Vicksburg Firearms to court on the grounds that the company's [[gross negligence]] led to her husband's death. During jury selection, jury consultant Rankin Fitch and his team communicate background information on each of the jurors through electronic surveillance to defense attorney Durwood Cable, who is in the courtroom.\n\nIn the jury pool, Nicholas (Nick) Easter attempts to get himself excused from jury duty. Judge Frederick Harkin refuses, claiming he's giving him a lesson in civic duty, and Fitch tells Cable that the judge has now given them no choice but to select Nick as a juror. Nick's congenial manner wins over his fellow jurors, but Frank Herrera, a [[Marine (military)|Marine]] veteran, who takes an instant dislike to him.\n\nA woman named Marlee makes an offer to Fitch and Rohr by phone: she will deliver the desired verdict to the first bidder. Rohr dismisses the offer, assuming it to be a tactic by Fitch to obtain a mistrial. Fitch asks for proof that she can deliver, though, which Nick provides by getting a juror expelled. By observing the jurors' behaviour through concealed cameras, Fitch identifies Nick as the influencer and orders his apartment to be searched, but finds nothing. \n\nMarlee retaliates by getting one of Fitch's jurors bounced. Fitch then blackmails three jurors, leading Rikki Coleman, to attempt suicide. He also sends his men to find a concealed storage device in Nick's apartment with key information, after which they set fire to it. Nick shows the judge video footage of Fitch's men breaking into his apartment, and the judge orders the jury sequestered.\n\nRohr's key witness, a former Vicksburg employee, doesn't show up. After confronting Fitch, Rohr decides that he cannot win the case. He asks his firm's partners for $10&nbsp;million to pay Marlee. Fitch sends an operative, Janovich, to kidnap Marlee, but she fights him off and raises the price to $15&nbsp;million. On principle, Rohr changes his mind and refuses to pay. After the CEO of Vicksburg Firearms loses his temper under cross-examination as a witness and makes a bad impression on the jury, Fitch agrees to pay Marlee to be certain of the verdict.\n\nFitch's subordinate Doyle, who is investigating Nick, finds that Nick is, in fact, Jeff Kerr, a law school drop-out. He then travels to Gardner, Indiana, where Jeff and his law school girlfriend Gabby (ie. Marlee) both come from. Doyle gently quizzes Gabby's mother, who reveals that Gabby's sister died in a shooting years ago when she was in high school. At the time, the town of Gardner sued the manufacturer of the guns used and lost; Fitch had helped the defense win the case. Doyle concludes that Nick and Marlee's offer is a set-up, and he calls Fitch, but it is too late as the money has already been paid.\n\nNick receives confirmation of receipt of payment, and he makes a speech, asking them to review the facts. Saying they owe it to Celeste Wood to deliberate, much to the chagrin of Herrera. He launches into a rant against the plaintiff, which undermines his support. The gun manufacturer is found liable, with the jury awarding $110&nbsp;million in [[general damages]] to Celeste Wood.\n\nAfter the trial, Nick and Marlee confront Fitch with a receipt for the $15&nbsp;million bribe which they will make public unless he retires. Fitch asks how they got the jury to vote for the plaintiff, to which Nick replies that he didn't; clarifying he stopped Fitch from stealing the trial by getting the jury to vote with their hearts. Nick and Marlee inform an indignant Fitch that the $15&nbsp;million \"fee\" will benefit the shooting victims in Gardner.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[John Cusack]] as Nicholas \"Nick\" Easter\n* [[Gene Hackman]] as Rankin Fitch\n* [[Dustin Hoffman]] as Wendell Rohr\n* [[Rachel Weisz]] as Marlee\n* [[Bruce Davison]] as Durwood Cable\n* [[Bruce McGill]] as Judge Frederick Harkin\n* [[Jeremy Piven]] as Lawrence Greene\n* [[Nick Searcy]] as Doyle\n* [[Stanley Anderson]] as Henry Jankle\n* [[Marguerite Moreau]] as Amanda Monroe\n* [[Leland Orser]] as Lamb\n* [[Gerry Bamman]] as Herman Grimes\n* [[Nestor Serrano]] as Janovich\n* [[Joanna Going]] as Celeste Wood\n* [[Cliff Curtis]] as Frank Herrera\n* [[Jennifer Beals]] as Vanessa Lembeck\n* [[Bill Nunn]] as Lonnie Shaver\n* [[Juanita Jennings]] as Loreen Duke\n* [[Nora Dunn]] as Stella Hulic\n* [[Guy Torry]] as Eddie Weese\n* [[Rusty Schwimmer]] as Millie Dupree\n* [[Rhoda Griffis]] as Rikki Coleman\n* [[Henry Darrow]] as Sebald\n* [[Corri English]] as Lydia Deets\n* [[Lori Heuring]] as Maxine\n* [[Dylan McDermott]] (uncredited) as Jacob Wood\n}}\n\n==Production==\nIn August 1996, Arnon Milchan and distribution partner [[Warner Bros.]] paid a record $8 million for the rights to the novel and first-look rights to Grisham's next novel.<ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Screen International]]|date=August 30, 1996|page=16|title=Holding Court|last=Carver|first=Benedict}}</ref> Directors slated to helm the picture included [[Joel Schumacher]] and [[Mike Newell (director)|Mike Newell]], with the lead being offered to [[Edward Norton]] and [[Will Smith]].<ref name=ew>[http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,474743,00.html The Runaway Jury]</ref> The novel's focus on big tobacco was retained until the 1999 film ''[[The Insider (film)|The Insider]]'' was released, necessitating a plot change from tobacco to gun companies.<ref name=ew/>\n\n==Revenue==\nThe film grossed $49,443,628 in the United States and $80,154,140 worldwide.<ref name=\"numbers\">[http://www.the-numbers.com/movies/2003/RJURY.php Runaway Jury - Box Office Data, Movie News, Cast Information - The Numbers]</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n''Runaway Jury'' received generally positive reviews from critics.
