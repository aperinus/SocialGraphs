The film co-stars [[Shu Qi]], [[Tony Leung Chiu-wai|Tony Leung]] and [[Wakin Chau|Emil Chau]]. The film performed well at the Hong Kong box office.\n\n==Plot==\nBu ([[Shu Qi]]) is a beautiful young girl from a small [[Taiwan]]ese fishing village who discovers a romantic [[message in a bottle]]. She heads for [[Hong Kong]] to find its writer, only to learn that it was in fact written by Albert ([[Tony Leung Chiu-wai]]), a lonely gay man. She then meets a wealthy recycling company owner, C.N. ([[Jackie Chan]]). They fall in love with each other. The plot is soon thickened by the rivalry between Howie Lo ([[Wakin Chau|Emil Chau]]) and C.N., who are both businessmen who have known each other since their childhood days.\n\nIn the English dubbed version, some of the dialogues are changed and a few scenes are edited out. These scenes included one at the airport where [[Sandra Ng]]'s and [[Sam Lee (actor)|Sam Lee]]'s characters conned and robbed Long Yi ([[Richie Jen]]) who supposedly is engaged to Bu and another where [[Stephen Chow]]'s policeman character came to investigate after C.N. fought off Howie Lo's masked goons and Albert's friends who on Bu's request pretended to be gangsters attacking her who in turn is pretending to be the reported missing girlfriend of a Taiwan gangster leader.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Jackie Chan]] as C.N.

Ho had argued that to ensure success in his films, Chan should play to his fanbase by only doing action movies and avoiding the love scenes that may alienate certain markets (notably [[Japan]]).\nHo died on 16 February 1998<ref>{{cite web\n  | title = MSN Movies\n  | work = Leonard Ho: Overview\n  | url = http://movies.msn.com/celebs/celeb.aspx?c=26095\n  | archive-url = https://archive.today/20130129045937/http://movies.msn.com/celebs/celeb.aspx?c=26095\n  | url-status = dead\n  | archive-date = 2013-01-29\n  | access-date = 2008-04-07\n  }}</ref> and Chan left Golden Harvest soon after, seeking a change and a new freedom to make the films he really wanted to. This coincided with his growing fame in the West, due to the international success of the film ''[[Rush Hour (1998 film)|Rush Hour]]''.\n\n''Gorgeous'' was originally conceived purely as a love story, with Chan as [[Film producer|producer]], but not as one of the film's cast. In order to secure the actress Shu Qi, the script of the film was re-written and a role for Chan was created. This soon developed into a starring role, and elements of action crept in. However, ''Gorgeous'' remains primarily a romantic comedy and so it differs from his usual all-out action films. The action scenes are fewer and there is no real bad guy character \u2013 the fight with the nominal enemy (played by [[Brad Allan]]) is a pre-arranged bout and both fighters wear boxing gloves \u2013 competitive rather than motivated by revenge or the fight for survival.\n\nThe director had wanted to use Chan's office as the set for C.N.'s apartment, but this proved impractical, particularly as that section of the office is on the third floor. However, many props from Chan's office were used including his own training dummy.\nChan said of his character C.N., that he was \"60-70% Jackie Chan\". The clothing the character wears, the training routine he undergoes and healthy lifestyle he maintains, his general good nature and his environmental role are all traits and actions of Chan himself.\n\nChan summarised the difference between the films ''Rush Hour'' and ''Gorgeous'', stating the former was a job, and the latter was his baby. In ''Rush Hour'' his role was restricted to actor and [[Stage combat|action director]]. In ''Gorgeous'', he was also the producer, [[Film editing|editor]] and was involved in [[Casting (performing arts)|casting]].<ref>{{cite video\n  | people = Jackie Chan\n  | title = Gorgeous, commentary track\n  | medium = DVD\n  | publisher = Uca Catalogue\n  | date = 1999}}</ref>\n\nAlthough a romantic comedy, the only significant kissing scene was dropped from the main film for fear that it would alienate certain [[East Asia]]n markets who may not want to see Chan in such a relationship. The underwater kiss scene was retained and appeared amongst the out-takes that accompany the film's [[closing credits]].\n\nThe film is notable for casting numerous, then, unknown actors who went on to achieve national and in some cases multi-national success.  These include: [[Sam Lee (actor)|Sam Lee]], [[Daniel Wu]], [[Richie Jen]] and [[Stephen Fung]].\n\n==Release==\n''Gorgeous'' was released in Hong Kong on 12 February 1999. In the Philippines, the film was released as ''High Risk'' in early September 2002.<ref>{{cite news|title=Jackie Chan strikes again|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=548VAAAAIBAJ&sjid=yQoEAAAAIBAJ&pg=6654%2C3397492|access-date=30 January 2022|work=[[Manila Standard]]|publisher=Kamahalan Publishing Corp.|date=31 August 2002|page=19|quote=In his upcoming film ''High Risk''...}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Movie Guide|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=8cBNEdFwSQkC&dat=20020904&printsec=frontpage&hl=en|access-date=January 30, 2022|work=[[Manila Standard]]|publisher=Kamahalan Publishing Corp.|date=September 4, 2002|page=21|quote=5 Dolby Surround [-] High Risk}}</ref>\n\n===Box office===\n''Gorgeous'' was a box office success in Hong Kong, grossing [[Hong Kong dollar|HK $]]40,545,889 during its theatrical run.\n\n===Awards and nominations===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!
