It was produced by [[George Pal]], directed by [[Rudolph Mat\u00e9]], and stars [[Richard Derr]], [[Barbara Rush]], [[Peter Hansen (actor)|Peter Hansen]], and [[John Hoyt]]. The film is based on the [[When Worlds Collide|1933 science fiction novel of the same name]], co-written by [[Edwin Balmer]] and [[Philip Wylie]].<ref>{{cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/When-Worlds-Collide-BALMER/dp/B001DABHPS/|title=When Worlds Collide|first1=Philip|last1=Wylie|author-link1=Philip Wylie|first2=Edwin|last2=Balmer|author-link2=Edwin Balmer|publisher=[[J.

Lippincott & Co.|Lippincott]]|location=[[New York City]]|year=1932|asin=B001DABHPS}}</ref>\n\nThe film's storyline concerns the coming destruction of the Earth by a [[Intergalactic star|rogue star]]{{#tag:ref|In the novel, the object that destroys the Earth is another planet. The change to a star makes the film's title inaccurate, as is the film's poster's wording: \"Planets destroy Earth!\"|group=Note}} called Bellus and the desperate efforts to build a [[space ark]] to transport a group of men and women to Bellus' single planet, Zyra.\n{{TOC limit|limit=2}}\n\n==Plot==\n<!--Per WP:FILMPLOT, this section should be from 400 to 700 words long.-->\nIn the [[prologue]], quotes from the [[Book of Genesis]] are shown and narrated, describing God's decision to wipe out humanity.\n \nPilot David Randall flies top-secret photographs from [[Union of South Africa|South African]] astronomer Dr. Emery Bronson to Dr. Cole Hendron in the United States. Hendron, with the assistance of his daughter Joyce, confirms their worst fears: Bronson has discovered that a rogue star named Bellus, accompanied by an Earth-sized planet named Zyra, is on a collision course with Earth.\n\nHendron warns the [[United Nations]] that the end of the world is little more than eight months away, with a close pass first by Zyra, before Bellus destroys the Earth nineteen days later. He pleads for the construction of \"[[Space ark|arks]]\" to transport a lucky few to Zyra in the faint hope that [[human extinction|humanity can be saved from extinction]]. With other scientists scoffing at his claims, his proposal is rejected.\n\nTwo wealthy humanitarians arrange for a start to construction and a lease on a former Army [[proving ground]] to build an ark. To finance the rest, Hendron meets wheelchair-using business magnate Sidney Stanton. Stanton demands the right to select the passengers in exchange for his money, but Hendron insists that he is not qualified to make those choices; all he can buy is a seat on the ark. Stanton capitulates. Groups in other nations start building their own spaceships.\n\nJoyce tells her father she is attracted to Randall, so he finds an excuse to keep him around, much to the annoyance of her boyfriend, medical doctor Tony Drake. As Bellus nears, [[martial law]] is declared and residents in coastal regions are evacuated inland.\n\nZyra makes a close approach first, causing massive earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, and [[tsunami]]s that wreak havoc around the world. Dr. Bronson is killed by a falling crane. Afterward, Drake and Randall travel by helicopter to drop off supplies to people in distress in the surrounding area. When Randall gets off to rescue a little boy stranded on a rooftop in a flooded area, Drake flies away, but reconsiders and returns.\n\nAs the day of doom approaches, the passengers are selected by lottery, though Hendron reserves seats for himself, Stanton, Joyce, Drake, pilot Dr. George Frey, and Randall, for his daughter's sake. He also includes the young boy who was rescued, for a total of 45 passengers. Randall, feeling he lacks any needed skills, rejects his guaranteed seat and instead pretends to draw a lottery number, but Hendron knows better. For Joyce's sake, Drake later tells Randall that Frey has a \"heart condition\" that may kill him during liftoff, convincing Randall he is needed as  co-pilot.\n\nThe cynical Stanton fears what the desperate lottery losers will do, so he stockpiles weapons. When a young man turns in his winning number because his sweetheart was not selected, Ferris{{snd}}Stanton's longsuffering assistant{{snd}}claims it at gunpoint, but is shot dead by Stanton. Shortly before liftoff, many of the lottery losers riot, seizing Stanton's weapons to try to force their way aboard. Hendron  initiates the launch prematurely while he and Stanton are still outside in order to conserve fuel and raise the chance of a successful landing. With an effort born of ultimate desperation, Stanton stands up and walks in a futile attempt to board the departing spaceship.\n\nThe crew are rendered unconscious by the [[g-force]] of acceleration, and do not witness Earth's collision with Bellus. When Randall comes to and sees Dr. Frey already awake and piloting the ship, he realizes he has been deceived.\n\nAfter the spaceship enters Zyra's atmosphere, the fuel runs out. Randall takes control and glides it to a safe landing. Zyra turns out to be habitable. Randall and Joyce walk hand-in-hand down the ramp with their fellow survivors as a new day dawns. In the background is an artificial structure.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Richard Derr]] as David Randall\n* [[Barbara Rush]] as Joyce Hendron\n* [[Peter Hansen (actor)|Peter Hansen]] as Dr. Tony Drake\n* [[John Hoyt]] as Sydney Stanton\n* [[Larry Keating]] as Dr. Cole Hendron\n* [[Rachel Ames]] as Julie Cummings (as Judith Ames)\n* [[Stephen Chase (actor)|Stephen Chase]] as Dr. George Frye\n* [[Frank Cady]] as Harold Ferris\n* [[Hayden Rorke]] as Dr. Emery Bronson\n* Sandro Giglio as Dr. Ottinger\n* [[James Seay]] as Donovan (uncredited)\n* [[Kirk Alyn]] as Rioter bringing guns (uncredited)\n* [[Stuart Whitman]] as Rioter by bank (uncredited)\n* [[John Ridgely]] as Chief Customs Inspector (uncredited)\n* [[Paul Frees]] as Narrator/U.S. President (uncredited)\n* [[Art Gilmore]] as Paul (uncredited)\n\n==Production==\nOriginally, producer-director [[Cecil B. DeMille]] considered adapting the novels ''[[When Worlds Collide]]'' and its sequel ''[[After Worlds Collide]]'' when they were first serialized in ''[[Blue Book (magazine)|Blue Book]]'' magazine in 1933. Film rights accordingly were held by Paramount, who often worked with De Mille.\n\nIn 1949 it was announced [[George Pal]] had purchased the screen rights.
