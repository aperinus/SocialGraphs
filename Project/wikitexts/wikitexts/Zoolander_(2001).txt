The film contains elements from a pair of short films directed by Russell Bates and written by [[Drake Sather]] and Stiller for the ''[[VH1]] Fashion Awards'' television specials in 1996 and 1997. The earlier short films and this film feature Derek Zoolander (Stiller), a dimwitted [[supermodel]]. It is the last film from [[Paramount Pictures]] with the involvement of [[Village Roadshow Pictures]].\n\nIn the film, top people in the fashion industry, Jacobim Mugatu ([[Will Ferrell]]) and Derek's agent Maury Ballstein ([[Jerry Stiller]]), are hired by other executives to assassinate the [[Prime Minister of Malaysia]] (Woodrow Asai), who will pass [[progressivism|progressive]] laws that would harm their businesses. Mugatu and Ballstein plan to [[Brainwashing|brainwash]] Zoolander into killing him. Meanwhile, Zoolander has several personal and career issues, including declining popularity, disappointment in his career choice from his family, and trying to find his true purpose which he suspects is not being a model. Through much research, journalist Matilda Jeffries ([[Christine Taylor]]) becomes aware of the planned assassination and informs Derek about it. After Derek reconciles with the competing male model Hansel ([[Owen Wilson]]), the three try to stop the Prime Minister's assassination from happening.\n\nA [[satire (film and television)|satire]] on the [[Fashion#Fashion industry|fashion industry]], the film received mixed reviews from critics, though it was a box-office success.  A sequel, ''[[Zoolander 2]]'', was released in February 2016,<ref name=\"zoo2\">{{cite web|title='Zoolander 2' Coming February 2016|url=https://www.slashfilm.com/zoolander-2-announced/|website=SlashFilm|date=March 10, 2015|access-date=March 10, 2015}}</ref> to negative reviews. An animated series, ''[[Zoolander: Super Model]]'', was released on Netflix UK in August 2016.<ref name=\"exclaim.ca\">{{cite web |title=Watch the Trailer for the 'Zoolander' Cartoon Movie |url=http://exclaim.ca/comedy/article/watch_the_trailer_for_the_zoolander_cartoon_movie/ |website=Exclaim |access-date=August 19, 2016 }}</ref>\n\n== Plot ==\n<!-- On an edit on May 1, 2021, this plot section was reduced from 705 to 461 words. Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot sections must be between 400 to 700 words. Discuss on the talk page before removing or adding details you feel are essential. -->\nIn New York City, male model Derek Zoolander is at a low point; he is ousted as the top male fashion model by the rising star Hansel, his roommates and colleagues are killed in a \"freak gasoline-fight accident\", and an attempt to reconnect with his [[South Jersey|southern New Jersey]] working class relatives ends with the family rejecting him. Meanwhile, fashion mogul Jacobim Mugatu and Derek's agent Maury Ballstein are charged by the fashion industry with finding a model who can be [[Brainwashing|brainwashed]] into assassinating the new progressive-leaning [[Prime Minister of Malaysia]], whose policies will prohibit them from retaining cheap [[Child labour|child labor]] in the country. Mugatu hires Derek, whom he normally doesn't work with, to star in the next [[Fashion show|runway show]] for his brainwashing plan. It involves Derek being [[Ivan Pavlov#Reflex system research|conditioned]] to attempt the assassination when the song \"[[Relax (song)|Relax]]\" by [[Frankie Goes to Hollywood]] is played.\n\nMatilda Jeffries, feeling responsible for Derek's downfall as she wrote a critical ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' article about him, becomes suspicious of Mugatu's offer. She tells her concerns to Derek, but he ignores her. After receiving info through calls from former [[hand model]] J.P. Prewett, Matilda and Derek meet him in a cemetery. Prewett reveals that the fashion industry has been behind several of history's political assassinations, including [[Assassination of Abraham Lincoln|Abraham Lincoln]] and [[Assassination of John F. Kennedy|John F. Kennedy]] and the brainwashed models are soon killed after they have completed their task. Mugatu's cronies attack the group, forcing Derek and Matilda to flee. They go to Hansel's home, the last place they believe Mugatu will think to look. Derek, Hansel, and Matilda bond, the two male models resolving their differences while partaking of Hansel's collection of narcotics and participating in group sex with Matilda and others. Derek and Hansel break into Maury's office to find evidence of the assassination plot, but they cannot operate his computer to find them.\n\nDerek goes to the runway, and Mugatu's [[disc jockey]] plays a remix version of \"Relax\". This activates Derek's mental programming, only for it to stop after Hansel breaks into the DJ booth and shuts off the turntable. Despite Hansel bringing the computer with him and smashing the computer on the floor (which he does out of taking Matilda's words of the files being in the computer literally), Maury admits to the conspiracy. Mugatu then attempts to kill the Prime Minister himself by throwing a [[shuriken]], but Derek stops it by unleashing his ultimate model look, \"Magnum\". In Derek's rural hometown, his father Larry watches the event on television, and proudly acknowledges Derek as his son. A few years later, Derek, Hansel, and Maury start ''\"The Derek Zoolander Center for Kids Who Can't Read Good and Who Wanna Learn to Do Other Stuff Good Too\"''. Derek and Matilda have a son named Derek Zoolander Jr., who has already [[Zoolander 2|developed his first modeling look]].\n\n== Cast ==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Ben Stiller]] as Derek Zoolander\n* [[Owen Wilson]] as Hansel McDonald \n* [[Christine Taylor]] as Matilda Jeffries\n* [[Will Ferrell]] as Jacobim Mugatu\n* [[Milla Jovovich]] as Katinka Ingabogovinana\n* [[Jerry Stiller]] as Maury Ballstein\n* [[David Duchovny]] as J.P.
