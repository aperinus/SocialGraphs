Word count as of 5 August 2021 is 684. -->\nIn 2019, following many catastrophic [[Natural disaster|natural disasters]], an international coalition commissions a system of [[Weather modification|climate-controlling]] satellites called \"Dutch Boy\". After Dutch Boy neutralizes a [[typhoon]] in [[Shanghai]], a [[United States Senate]] sub-committee reprimands chief architect Jake Lawson because he brought Dutch Boy online without authorization and replaces him with his brother Max, who works under [[United States Secretary of State]] Leonard Dekkom.\n\nThree years later, a [[United Nations]] team stationed in the [[Registan Desert]] comes across a frozen village. Makmoud Habib, an Indian engineer working on the International Climate Space Station (ICSS), copies data from the satellite responsible for [[Afghanistan]] onto a hard drive before he is killed in a supposed accident. After convincing [[President of the United States|President]] Andrew Palma to conduct an investigation, Max persuades Jake to go to the ICSS to investigate. In [[Hong Kong]], a satellite severely increases city temperatures and causes [[Fire whirl|fire whirls]] and the collapse of multiple buildings.\n\nJake arrives at the ICSS to examine the malfunctioning satellites, which were damaged and their data erased. He works with station commander Ute Fassbinder and her crew, which consists of engineer Eni Adisa, systems specialist Duncan Taylor, technician Al Hernandez, and security officer Ray Dussette. They recover the hard drive but hide it from the crew, suspecting a traitor, and examine the data, leading to the discovery that a [[computer virus]] has been introduced, causing the malfunctions and has wiped out the login access of key senior people to the satellite. Suspecting Palma is using Dutch Boy as a weapon, Jake tells Max he needs to reboot the system to eliminate the virus, which requires the kill code held by Palma. The ICSS staff neutralize malfunctioning satellites by deliberately knocking them offline via collisions with replacement satellites.\n\nBack on Earth, Cheng Long discovers that he and Max have lost login access and warns Max of a global cataclysm known as a \"Geostorm\" if the malfunction continues. Cheng is pursued to [[Washington, D.C.]] by a team of rogue government agents, who kill him in a traffic incident, but not before he says \"Zeus.\" Discovering Project Zeus simulates extreme weather patterns to create a Geostorm, Max enlists his girlfriend, [[United States Secret Service|Secret Service]] agent Sarah Wilson, to acquire the code. During this time, the ICSS team loses control of all operations as the virus initiates the [[self-destruct]] program.\n\nDuring the [[Democratic National Convention]] in [[Orlando, Florida]], Max discovers Orlando is next to be targeted after a massive [[hailstorm]] hits [[Tokyo]] and an offshore [[Flash freezing|cold snap]] takes out a portion of [[Rio de Janeiro]]. Max requests Dekkom's help, but Dekkom instead tries to kill Max unsuccessfully, revealing himself as the saboteur; Max immediately informs Sarah. The two kidnap Palma to protect him from Dekkom's agents and secure the kill code. As they escape from the arena before a lightning storm destroys it, Max reveals their activities and Dekkom's treachery to Palma. After outsmarting Dekkom's mercenaries, the three arrest Dekkom and confront him about his plans: to eliminate the other elected officials in America's line of succession, allowing him to dominate the world while eliminating America's enemies at the same time. Max and Sarah escort Palma to the [[Kennedy Space Center]], where they transmit the code but learn that the self-destruct sequence cannot be stopped.\n\nAs more disasters strike around the world (including [[tornado]]es in [[Mumbai]], a major [[Heat wave|heatwave]] in [[Moscow]], and a [[megatsunami]] in [[Dubai]]), Jake realizes that Duncan is the traitor who masterminded Habib's death and created the storms on Dekkom's orders and confronts him. Duncan reveals that his doings are for the big paycheck from Dekkom by joining his scheme compared to the meager salary he receives as a software engineer. Jake mocks Duncan for his foolishness as if he does not stop the Geostorm, there will be nothing left on Earth for him to spend his millions but Duncan sadistically states that he is curious to see how the world would end. Jake escapes in the ensuing confrontation, but Duncan accidentally ejects himself into space. As the crew evacuates the station, Jake and Ute stay behind to ensure the system's reboot, eliminating the virus and transferring satellite control to [[NASA]], thus preventing the Geostorm at the last second.\n\nThey then escape in a replacement satellite, where they take shelter as the self-destruct sequence completes. They use the replacement satellite's thrusters as a beacon, and a nearby shuttle piloted by Hernandez picks them up.\n\nSix months later, Jake is working as the head engineer for Dutch Boy once more, which an international committee now administers.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Gerard Butler]] as Jacob \"Jake\" Lawson, a satellite designer, former ICSS commander, and Hannah's father \n* [[Jim Sturgess]] as [[United States Assistant Secretary of State|Assistant Secretary of State]] Max Lawson, Jake's younger brother and Hannah's uncle\n* [[Abbie Cornish]] as U.S. [[United States Secret Service|Secret Service]] Agent Sarah Wilson, Max's fianc\u00e9e\n* [[Alexandra Maria Lara]] as Ute Fassbinder, the commander of the space station and [[German Aerospace Center|DLR]] Astronaut\n* [[Ed Harris]] as U.S. [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] Leonard Dekkom\n* [[Andy Garc\u00eda]] as [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] Andrew Palma\n* [[Richard Schiff]] as [[Virginia]] Senator Thomas Cross\n* [[Robert Sheehan]] as Duncan Taylor, a British crew member of the ICSS and [[UK Space Agency|UKSA]] Astronaut\n* [[Eugenio Derbez]] as Al Hernandez, a Mexican crew member of the ICSS and [[Agencia Espacial Mexicana|AEM]] Astronaut\n* [[Adepero Oduye]] as Eni Adisa, a Nigerian crew member of the ICSS and [[National Space Research and Development Agency|NASRDA]] Astronaut\n* [[Amr Waked]] as Ray Dussette, a French crew member of the ICSS and [[CNES]] Astronaut\n* [[Daniel Wu]] as Cheng Long, the Hong Kong-based supervisor for the Dutch Boy Program\n* [[Zazie Beetz]] as Dana, a cybersecurity expert, and good friends with Max\n* [[Talitha Bateman]] as Hannah Lawson, Jake's daughter and Max's niece.
