The film stars [[Hanna Schygulla]] as Maria, whose marriage to the soldier Hermann remains unfulfilled due to [[World War II]] and his post-war imprisonment. Maria adapts to the realities of post-war Germany and becomes the wealthy mistress of an industrialist, all the while staying true to her love for Hermann.\n\nThe film was one of the more successful works of Fassbinder and shaped the image of the [[New German Cinema]] in foreign countries. It is the first installment of Fassbinder's [[BRD Trilogy]], followed by ''[[Lola (1981 film)|Lola]]'' (1981) and ''[[Veronika Voss]]'' (1982).\n\n==Plot==\nThe film starts in Germany in 1943. During an Allied bombing raid Maria marries the soldier Hermann Braun. After \"half a day and a whole night\" together, Hermann returns to the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern front]] the following day. Following the end of the war, Maria is informed that Hermann has been killed. Maria starts work as a prostitute in a bar frequented by American soldiers. She has a relationship with African-American soldier Bill, who supports her and gives her nylon stockings and cigarettes. She becomes pregnant by Bill.\n\nHowever, Hermann was not killed, and returns home to discover Maria and Bill undressing each other. A fight between Hermann and Bill ensues. When Hermann seems in danger, Maria unintentionally kills Bill, striking his head with a full bottle. Maria is tried by a military tribunal and expresses her love for both Bill and Hermann; Hermann is so struck with Maria's devotion that he takes the blame for the killing and is imprisoned. Maria has a [[stillbirth]] and asks her doctor to promise to maintain the grave. On the train home, Maria positions herself to catch the eye of a wealthy industrialist, Karl Oswald. Oswald, an older man, offers her a position as his assistant, and shortly thereafter Maria becomes his mistress as she had planned. Maria visits Hermann again and tells him about the development, promising that their life will start as soon as he is released. Maria becomes wealthy and buys a house.\n\nOswald visits Hermann and offers to make him and Maria heirs to his wealth if Hermann deserts Maria after his release. Neither man tells Maria of their agreement. On release, Hermann emigrates to [[Canada]] and sends Maria a red rose each month to remind her he still loves her.\n\nFollowing Oswald's death, Hermann returns to Germany and to Maria. When Oswald's will is read by Senkenberg, the executor, Maria hears about Oswald's agreement with Hermann. Distressed, Maria and Hermann briefly argue about how they supposedly sacrificed through their whole life for each other, then she goes into the kitchen to light a cigarette from the burner of the stovetop. Maria is offscreen as Hermann is seen watching her, when he lurches away and screams \"''Nein''\". Before this, Maria had left the gas stove opened after lighting up a cigarette in the same place. A moment later, the apartment suffers a gas explosion from the stove, killing Maria and Hermann.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n*[[Hanna Schygulla]] as Maria Braun\n*[[Klaus L\u00f6witsch]] as Hermann Braun\n*[[Ivan Desny]] as Karl Oswald\n*[[Gisela Uhlen]] as Mother\n*[[Elisabeth Trissenaar]] as Betti Klenze\n*[[Gottfried John]] as Willi Klenze\n*[[Hark Bohm]] as Senkenberg\n*[[George Byrd]] as Bill\n*[[Claus Holm]] as Doctor\n*[[G\u00fcnter Lamprecht]] as Hans Wetzel \n*[[Anton Schiersner]] as Grandpa Berger\n*[[Sonja Neudorfer]] as Red Cross nurse\n*[[Volker Spengler]] as Train conductor\n*[[Isolde Barth]] as Vevi\n*[[Lilo Pempeit]] as Mrs. Ehmke\n*[[Bruce Low]] as American at the conference\n*[[G\u00fcnther Kaufmann]] as American on the train\n*[[Karl-Heinz von Hassel]] as Prosecuting attorney \n*[[Hannes Kaetner]] as Justice of the Peace\n*[[Kristine de Loup]] as Notary\n}}\n\n==Production==\n\n===Writing and pre-production===\nThe idea for ''The Marriage of Maria Braun'' can be traced to the collaboration of Rainer Werner Fassbinder and [[Alexander Kluge]] on the unrealized television project ''The Marriage of our Parents'' (''Die Ehen unserer Eltern''), which was developed after the critical success of the [[Anthology film|omnibus film]] ''[[Germany in Autumn]]''. Fassbinder worked on a draft screenplay together with Klaus-Dieter Lang and [[Kurt Raab]] and presented it in the early summer of 1977 to his longtime collaborator [[Peter M\u00e4rthesheimer]], who at that time was working as a dramaturge at the [[Bavaria Film|Bavaria Film Studios]]. In August 1977, M\u00e4rthesheimer and his partner [[Pea Fr\u00f6hlich]], a professor of psychology and pedagogics, were commissioned to write a screenplay based on the draft together.<ref name=\"wunderbarezeit\">{{cite book|last=M\u00e4rthesheimer|first=Peter|author2=Pea Fr\u00f6hlich|title=Die Ehe der Maria Braun: Ein Drehbuch fur Rainer Werner Fassbinder|editor=Michael T\u00f6teberg|publisher=Belleville Verlag|year=1997|chapter=Eine wunderbare Zeit|page=5|isbn=3-923646-58-5|language=de}}</ref> Although it was M\u00e4rthesheimer's and Fr\u00f6hlich's first screenplay their knowledge of Fassbinder's works allowed them to match the screenplay to the characteristic style and structure of Fassbinder's other works.<ref>{{cite book|last=T\u00f6teberg|first=Michael|title=Rainer Werner Fassbinder|publisher=Rowohlt Taschenbuch Verlag|date=June 2002|pages=116&ndash;117|language=de}}</ref> Fassbinder changed only a few details in the completed screenplay, including some dialogue and the end of the film.

Albatros Filmproduktion only contributed 42,500 [[Deutsche Mark|DM]], the public broadcaster [[Westdeutscher Rundfunk]] 566,000 DM, the {{Interlanguage link multi|Filmf\u00f6rderungsanstalt|de|3=Filmf\u00f6rderungsanstalt|lt=German Federal Film Board}} 400,000 DM and the distributor guaranteed another 150,000 DM. This forced Fengler to find another financing partner, offering [[Hanns Eckelkamp]]'s Trio-Film a share in the film in December 1977.<ref name=\"marthesheimer-page-155\">{{cite book|last=M\u00e4rthesheimer|first=Peter|author2=Pea Fr\u00f6hlich|title=Die Ehe der Maria Braun: Ein Drehbuch fur Rainer Werner Fassbinder|editor=Michael T\u00f6teberg|publisher=Belleville Verlag|year=1997|page=155|chapter=Schwarzmarkt der Gef\u00fchle|isbn= 3-923646-58-5|language=de}}</ref> Fengler had promised Fassbinder's Tango-Film a share of 50 percent of the film profits, but as Fengler - by offering Trio-Film a share in the film - effectively oversold the rights only 15 percent of the film right ultimately remained with Fassbinder. Fassbinder subsequently referred to Fengler as gangster and it led to litigations against Fengler that continued even after Fassbinder's death.<ref name=\"elsaesser-page-98\">{{cite book|last=Elsaesser|first=Thomas|title=Fassbinder's Germany: History, Identity, Subject|url=https://archive.org/details/fassbindersgerma00elsa|url-access=limited|publisher=Amsterdam University Press|date=June 1996|page=[https://archive.org/details/fassbindersgerma00elsa/page/n98 98]|isbn=90-5356-059-9}}</ref>\n\nShooting began in January 1978 in [[Coburg]]. Bad-tempered and quarrelsome, Fassbinder shot the film during the day and worked on the script to ''Berlin Alexanderplatz'' during the night.<ref>{{cite book|last=Berling|first=Peter|title=Die 13 Jahre des Rainer Werner Fassbinder. Seine Filme, seine Freunde, seine Feinde|publisher=Bastei L\u00fcbbe|year=1972|pages=336|isbn=3-7857-0643-X|language=de}}</ref> In order to sustain his work schedule he consumed large quantities of cocaine, supplied by the production manager [[Harry Baer]] and the actor [[Peter Berling]]. According to Berling this was the main reason why the film went over the budget, as the cash for the cocaine was coming from Fengler.<ref name=\"elsaesser-page-98\"/>\n\nIn February 1978 the budget was reaching 1.7 million DM, and two most expensive scenes - the explosions at the beginning and at the end of the film - had not yet been shot. By this time Fassbinder had learned about Fengler's deal with Eckelkamp and the overselling of the film rights. He felt deceived and broke with his longtime collaborator Fengler. He demanded the status of a co-producer for himself and obtained an injunction against Fengler and Eckelkamp. Fassbinder fired most of the film crew, ended the shooting in Coburg at the end of February and then moved to [[Berlin]], where he finished shooting the last scenes.<ref name=\"marthesheimer-page-155\" /> Consequently, the biographer Thomas Elsaesser called the production of the film \"one of Fassbinder's least happy experiences\" and Berlin \"one of the decisive self-destructive episodes in Rainer's life\".<ref name=\"elsaesser-page-97\" />\n\n==Distribution and reception==\n\n===Release===\nIn parallel to the preparations for the production of ''Berlin Alexanderplatz'' Fassbinder worked with film editor [[Juliane Lorenz]] on the editing and post-production of ''The Marriage of Maria Braun''. The failure of ''[[Despair (film)|Despair]]'' at the [[1978 Cannes Film Festival|Cannes Film Festival]] in May 1978 spurred Fassbinder to prepare an [[answer print]] overnight and to present the film on 22 May 1978 to German film producers in a private screening. Attended by, among others [[Horst Wendlandt]], [[Sam Waynberg]], [[Karl Spiehs]], [[G\u00fcnter Rohrbach]] and the majority shareholder of the [[Filmverlag der Autoren]], [[Rudolf Augstein]] the screening was a success.<ref>{{cite book|last=Berling|first=Peter|title=Die 13 Jahre des Rainer Werner Fassbinder.

Commissioned by Eckelkamp, the author [[Gerhard Zwerenz]] novelized the film. It was published in several weekly installments in the magazine ''[[Stern (magazine)|Der Stern]]'' from March over a period of three months, thus increasing public interest in the film.<ref>{{cite book|last=M\u00e4rthesheimer|first=Peter|author2=Pea Fr\u00f6hlich|title=Die Ehe der Maria Braun: Ein Drehbuch fur Rainer Werner Fassbinder|editor=Michael T\u00f6teberg|publisher=Belleville Verlag|year=1997|pages=163&ndash;165|chapter=Schwarzmarkt der Gef\u00fchle|isbn=3-923646-58-5|language=de}}</ref> The official premiere of the film was on 20 February 1979 during the [[29th Berlin International Film Festival]].

He received a financing agreement for one of his favorite projects based on [[Pitigrilli]]'s novel ''Cocaine'' and was able to increase the budget for ''Berlin Alexanderplatz''. Several German commercial film producers expressed an interest in making films with Fassbinder. The seasoned film producer [[Luggi Waldleitner]] would produce the Fassbinder film ''[[Lili Marleen (film)|Lili Marleen]]'' with Hanna Schygulla in the main role. [[Horst Wendlandt]] would produce the two other films in the BRD Trilogy, ''[[Lola (1981 film)|Lola]]'' and ''[[Veronika Voss]]''.

Eckelkamp saw himself as the sole owner of all rights, but sent a check in the amount of 70,000 DM to Fassbinder in 1982 to appease the director. After Fassbinder's death his mother and heiress Liselotte Eder revived the claims, but was rejected by Eckelkamp. In the course of legal proceedings Eckelkamp was ordered in 1986 to disclose the film's finances to the newly founded Rainer Werner Fassbinder Foundation. Eckelkamp's Trio Film disclosed a budget of almost 2 million DM, additional marketing costs of 1 million DM and a net profit of 1 million DM. When Trio-Film was ordered to pay to Fassbinder's heirs 290,000 DM Eckelkamp refused. At the request of the Rainer Werner Fassbinder Foundation Trio Film had to declare bankruptcy in 1988. In the course of the continuing legal proceedings, the [[Oberlandesgericht]] [[D\u00fcsseldorf]] certified in 1990 that Fassbinder was not a co-producer of the film.
