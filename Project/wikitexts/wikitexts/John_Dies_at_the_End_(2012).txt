In the present day, he meets with a reporter, Arnie Blondestone, to recount the supernatural events that plagued the small, undisclosed city David lives in.\n\nSome time ago, David is at a party with his friend John, with acquaintances Fred Chu, Justin White, and Amy Sullivan, who has an [[amputee|amputated]] hand. David learns that Amy's dog, Bark Lee, has gone missing after biting Robert Marley, a drug dealer who pretends to be Jamaican. The dealer claims to have powers and knows things about David that he shouldn't. As he leaves the party, David sees Bark next to his car.\n\nJohn calls Dave, demanding he come over at once. At John's apartment, David, oblivious to a bizarre creature only John can see, finds a syringe containing a black-colored drug, John tells David that the drug, \"Soy Sauce\", given to him by Marley, grants inhuman knowledge when taken, along with dumping the user in alternate dimensions and timestreams, as demonstrated by a past version of John calling present Dave.\n\nAs they drive off, David accidentally stabs himself with the syringe, propelling him through alternate dimensions. Returning to the present, a strange man, Roger North, appears in the backseat. Roger puts a strange creature down David's shirt and tells him to drive. David uses the cigarette lighter to burn off the creature and use the commotion to stop the car and threaten Roger, who disappears.\n\nDetective Lawrence Appleton questions the two at a police station about the party. Appleton reveals that John and Justin White were the only survivors of a drug-fueled afterparty thrown by Robert Marley. Everyone else either disappeared, or suffered grisly, bizarre deaths.\n\nIn the present, an incredulous Arnie tries to leave, but Dave convinces him to stay after showing him a strange monster in his car that can't be easily seen.\n\nDuring questioning by the cops, John dies for unknown reasons. While one of the interrogators leaves to investigate John's death, John telepathically contacts Dave. John helps Dave realize the other cop in the room is a ghost and helps him escape from the police station. Dave is then guided to Marley's house. Marley's Soy Sauce knocks Dave unconscious. He wakes up to see Appleton preparing to burn down the trailer, who tells him John's body disappeared and that the Soy Sauce is letting in some kind of evil force. Appleton shoots David, who survives by time-traveling and tampering with the round he was shot with. Bark, controlled by John, drives David's car through the wall, allowing him to escape.\n\nJustin White, possessed, appears in David's apartment and subdues him. Dave tries to kill him but he's infected. Justin kidnaps David, Fred, Amy, Bark, and John and takes them to an abandoned mall, hoping to use a ghostly door inside to travel to another dimension. John manipulates White into going outside, where a waiting Appleton kills him. Appleton then explodes into a swarm of demonic insects who then possess Fred, causing David to kill him. Amy opens the ghost door with her [[phantom limb]], allowing John and Dave passage. There they meet celebrity psychic and exorcist North and Albert Marconi, who say the source of the strange happenings is Korrok, an eldritch biological supercomputer who has turned into a genocidal god that wants to travel to new dimensions and conquer them. Marconi gives David and John an LSD-laced C4 explosive to incapacitate Korrok with.\n\nThe two step through a portal to an alternate Earth. Disciples of Korrok greet them as \"chosen ones\" and present a brutal [[totalitarian]] society, where dissenters are horribly maimed by Korrok's monsters. The duo are brought before Korrok, who plans to devour them, absorb their knowledge of dimensional travel, and conquer their dimension. John tries to activate the bomb but fumbles. Bark Lee, who followed the two, grabs the bomb and flings himself into Korrok, detonating it and destroying the two of them.\n\nUpon escaping, David and John meet Marconi and learn that Bark was meant to defeat Korrok all along. After biting a Soy Sauce-addled Marley, it linked him to Marconi and Roger North. Amy becomes David's girlfriend. With Marconi's help, David and John become exorcists and demon hunters.\n\nIn the present, Arnie decides to publish the story. Dave realizes he perceives Arnie differently than how he really looks, and the two find the real Arnie decapitated in the trunk of his car, who was killed after first contacting Dave. Dave tells Arnie that Dave's mind projected his current shape. Arnie tries to deny this but soon vanishes into thin air.\n\nLater, John and Dave play basketball and inadvertently throw their ball into a post-apocalyptic dimension. After going in after it, a paramilitary organization informs them they are chosen ones who will restore the world, but an annoyed John and Dave walk off.\n\n==Cast==\n<!--- Cast and order per tombstone closing credits, roles per closing credits scroll --->\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Chase Williamson]] as Dave\n* [[Rob Mayes]] as John\n* [[Paul Giamatti]] as Arnie Blondestone\n* [[Clancy Brown]] as Dr. Albert Marconi\n* [[Glynn Turman]] as Detective\n* [[Doug Jones (actor)|Doug Jones]] as Roger North\n* [[Daniel Roebuck]] as Largeman\n* [[Fabianne Therese]] as Amy\n* [[Jonny Weston]] as Justin White\n* Allison Weissman as Shelly\n* [[Jimmy Wong]] as Fred Chu\n* Tai Bennett as Robert Marley\n* [[Ethan Erickson]] as Sergeant McElroy\n* [[Angus Scrimm]] as Father Shellnut\n}}\n\n==Production==\nIn 2007, [[Don Coscarelli]] optioned the film rights to the [[Comic novel|comedic]] [[Horror fiction|horror novel]] ''[[John Dies at the End]]''.<ref name=\"aintitcoolnews1\" /> The novel, written by [[David Wong (author)|David Wong]], was first published online as a [[webserial]] beginning in 2001, then as an edited [[ebook|manuscript]] in 2004, and then as a paperback edition in 2007. Coscarelli stated, \"I was greatly impressed by David Wong's crazed originality and impressive imagination. He's like a mash-up of [[Douglas Adams]] and [[Stephen King]], both smart and goofy, scary and funny \u2013 it really spoke to me. [It] is as addictive as the 'Soy Sauce' street drug that kicks the plot into gear.\"<ref name=\"dreadcentral1\" />\n\n[[Executive producer|Executive produced]] by Daniel Carey and [[Paul Giamatti]], with producers Don Coscarelli, Brad Baruh, Andy Meyers, Roman Perez, [[Aaron Godfred]], and Josh Lewin, M3 Alliance, M3 Creative, and Midnight Alliance \"secretly\" began [[principal photography]] in October 2010.<ref name=\"aintitcoolnews1\" /> This was confirmed after hints posted by Coscarelli on his [[Twitter]] page were verified.<ref name=\"fangoria1\"/><ref name=\"dreadcentral3\" /><ref name=\"twitch1\" /> Filming took place on locations in [[Southern California]].

Literally, when I read the email, I thought, 'This would make a great movie.'\"<ref name=\"JDE\"/>\n\nGiamatti called the novel \"an embarrassment of riches\" and said: \"what's going to be tragic is what's going to have to go, because stuff is going to have to go and [...] it will kill me whatever goes, because you want it all to be in there and you've still got to have this stuffed bag of stuff.\" He also praised the actors and Coscarelli's choices, stating, \"Don cast it brilliantly.
