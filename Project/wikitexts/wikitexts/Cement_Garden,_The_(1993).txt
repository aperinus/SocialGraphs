One day, while unloading large bags of cement to resurface the garden path of their home, the father collapses from a heart attack and dies. Only a few months after this tragedy, Jack\u2019s mother takes ill and becomes bedridden and frail, prompting Jack and Julie to take control of the household.\n\nThough Jack and Julie initially clash due to Jack\u2019s immaturity and selfishness, the pair\u2019s tension gradually shifts to a romantic one as Jack develops an incestuous crush on Julie. In their new roles as the parental figures in the family, Jack finds himself escorting Sue and Tom to and from school, while Julie takes up the cooking and cleaning duties.\n\nJack\u2019s mother informs him that her illness has become worse and she will have to go to the hospital for a couple of months. She tells Jack and Julie not to tell anyone about her absence, or else the remaining family members will be forced into foster care and their home will be torn down. Shortly afterwards, the mother dies at home of her illness. In an attempt to conceal their mother\u2019s death from authorities and thus evade placement into foster care, Jack and Julie entomb their mother's body in the basement, in a cement sarcophagus made from the leftover bags of cement that Jack's father had bought.\n\nThe children become more withdrawn and their mental states further disintegrate as time passes with no adult supervision following their mother's death. Though Jack slowly matures, he stops bathing. Sue becomes more introverted, distancing herself from her siblings and confiding only in her diary. Julie forms a relationship with an older man named Derek, whom Jack starts to view with jealousy and hostility. Tom, attempting to remodel himself as a girl, takes up cross-dressing, then later starts to behave like an infant, sleeping in Julie's room in a crib and drinking from a bottle. Derek becomes suspicious of what is inside the basement due to the smell. When forced to explain the sarcophagus to Derek, Jack lies and tells Derek that the cement block contains a dead dog, subtly referencing his mother in the process.\n\nTom reveals to Jack that Derek has told him that the cement block actually contains their mother. Jack then realizes Julie has told Derek the truth of what\u2019s inside. Julie wakes up Jack, and sitting together on her bed, Julie tells Jack that she and Derek are not physically intimate and that he is an immature adult who lives with his mother. Their conversation becomes more intimate, with Julie undressing and the two cuddling while contemplating the future now that someone else knows their family's secret. Jack predicts they will be taken into foster care, and their house will be torn down like the other prefabs in the area, saying \"one day, someone will come rooting round. All they will find will be a few broken bricks in the long grass.\" Derek walks in on the two in bed together and is horrified by what he sees. He demands to know how long \"this\" has been going on, and Julie simply replies, \"ages and ages.\"\n\nUnperturbed, Jack and Julie lie back down on the bed and converse further regarding whether what they did was right. Jack states that what they are doing \"seems natural to me.\" Julie agrees with a smile and shortly after the two begin to make love as the sound of Derek smashing up the cement tomb containing their mother reverberates around the house. The film ends showing Jack and Julie asleep together, while blue lights from a police car are seen flickering against the walls.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Andrew N.
