''Frida'' received generally positive reviews from critics, and won two [[Academy Awards]] for [[Academy Award for Best Makeup and Hairstyling|Best Makeup]] and [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Best Original Score]] among six nominations.\n\n==Plot==\n{{hatnote|Throughout the film, various scenes start as a shot of one of Kahlo's real-life paintings before slowly dissolving into a [[live action]] scene with actors.}}\n\nIn 1925, [[Frida Kahlo]] suffers a [[Psychological trauma|trauma]]tic accident at the age of 18 onboard a wooden-bodied bus that collides with a streetcar. Impaled by a metal pole, the injuries she sustains plague her for the rest of her life. To help her through [[convalescence]], [[Guillermo Kahlo|her father]] brings her a canvas to paint on.\n\nOnce regaining the ability to walk with a cane, Frida visits [[mural]]ist [[Diego Rivera]], demanding an honest critique of her paintings. Rivera falls in love with her work, and they begin a dysfunctional relationship. When he proposes, she tells him she expects loyalty from him, if not fidelity. Throughout the marriage, Rivera has affairs with a wide array of women. At the same time, the [[bisexuality|bisexual]] Kahlo takes on male and female lovers, including, in one case, the same woman as Rivera.\n\nThe couple travels to New York City in 1934, so Rivera may paint the mural ''[[Man at the Crossroads]]'', at the behest of the [[Rockefeller family]], inside [[Rockefeller Center]]. While living in the United States, Kahlo suffers a [[miscarriage]] and travels back to Mexico for her mother's funeral. Rivera refuses to compromise his [[communist]] vision of the work to the needs of the patron, [[Nelson Rockefeller]]; as a result, the mural is destroyed. The pair return to Mexico, with Rivera more reluctant.\n\nKahlo's sister, [[Cristina Kahlo|Cristina]], moves in with them at their [[San \u00c1ngel]] studio home as Rivera's assistant. Soon afterward, Kahlo discovers Rivera is sleeping with her. Leaving him, she subsequently sinks into [[alcoholism]] after moving back to her family's [[Coyoac\u00e1n]] home. They reunite during a ''[[Day of the Dead|D\u00eda de los Muertos]]'' celebration where he asks her to welcome and house [[Leon Trotsky]], who has been granted [[political asylum]] in Mexico. Trotsky expresses his love for Kahlo's work during an excursion to [[Teotihuacan]], and they begin an affair. Soon, Trotsky's wife learns of the affair, forcing the couple to leave the safety of Kahlo's home.\n\nKahlo leaves for Paris when Diego realizes she was unfaithful to him with Trotsky. However, Rivera had little problem with Kahlo's other affairs, as Trotsky was too important to be intimately involved with his wife. When she returns to Mexico, he asks for a divorce. In 1940, Trotsky is murdered in [[Mexico City]]. Initially, Rivera is suspected by police of orchestrating the assassination. When they fail to locate him, Kahlo is arrested. Cristina arrives and escorts Kahlo out of prison, explaining that Rivera convinced [[L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas|President C\u00e1rdenas]] to release her.\n\nKahlo has her toes removed when her doctor notices they have become [[gangrene|gangrenous]]. Rivera remorsefully asks Kahlo to remarry him, and she agrees. Her health worsens, leading to the amputation of a leg and bronchopneumonia, which leaves her bedridden. In 1953, Kahlo's bed is carried from her home to a museum to attend her first [[solo exhibition]] in her native country.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Salma Hayek]] as [[Frida Kahlo]]\n* [[Alfred Molina]] as [[Diego Rivera]]\n* [[Geoffrey Rush]] as [[Leon Trotsky]]\n* [[M\u00eda Maestro]] as [[Cristina Kahlo]]\n* [[Ashley Judd]] as [[Tina Modotti]]\n* [[Antonio Banderas]] as [[David Alfaro Siqueiros]]\n* [[Edward Norton]] as [[Nelson Rockefeller]]\n* [[Diego Luna]] as Alejandro Gonzalez Arias\n* Margarita Sanz as [[Natalia Sedova]]\n* [[Patricia Reyes Sp\u00edndola]] as Matilde Kahlo\n* [[Roger Rees]] as [[Guillermo Kahlo]]\n* [[Valeria Golino]] as [[Guadalupe Mar\u00edn|Lupe Mar\u00edn]]\n* Omar Rodriguez (aka Omar Chagall) as [[Andr\u00e9 Breton]]\n* Felipe Fulop as [[Jean Van Heijenoort]]\n* [[Saffron Burrows]] as Gracie\n* [[Karine Plantadit|Karine Plantadit-Bageot]] as [[Josephine Baker]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Allusions and paintings==\nThe passengers in the bus Kahlo rides in that crashes with a streetcar are based on subjects in the painter's 1929 portrait, ''The Bus''. Other Kahlo paintings either shown directly or depicted in the film by the characters include ''[[Frieda and Diego Rivera]]'' (1931), ''[[What the Water Gave Me (painting)|What the Water Gave Me]]'' (1938), ''[[The Two Fridas]]'' (1939), ''[[The Broken Column]]'' (1944), and ''[[The Wounded Deer]]'' (1946).\n\n[[Brothers Quay|The Brothers Quay]] created the [[stop motion]] animation sequence in the film depicting the initial stages of Kahlo's recovery at the hospital after the accident are inspired by the Mexican holiday [[Day of the Dead]]. The gown [[Valeria Golino]] wears at Kahlo's 1953 Mexican solo art exhibition is a replica of the dress that her character, [[Lupe Mar\u00edn]], wore in Rivera's 1938 portrait of her.\n\n==Production==\n\nThe film version of [[Frida Kahlo]]'s life was initially championed by [[Nancy Hardin]], a former book editor and Hollywood-based literary agent, turned early \"female studio executive\", who, in the mid-1980s wished to \"make the transition to independent producing.\"<ref name=\"Book LA\"/> Learning of [[Hayden Herrera]]'s biography of Kahlo, Hardin saw Kahlo's life as very contemporary, her \"story ... an emblematic tale for women torn between marriage and career.\"<ref name=\"Book LA\"/> Optioning the book in 1988, Hardin \"tried to sell it as an epic love story in the tradition of ''[[Out of Africa (film)|Out of Africa]]'', attracting tentative interest from actresses such as [[Meryl Streep]] and [[Jessica Lange]], but receiving rejection from the film studios. As Kahlo's art gained prominence, however \"in May 1990 one of Kahlo's self-portraits sold at Sotheby's for $1.5 million, the highest price ever paid at auction for a Latin American painting.\"<ref name=\"Book LA\"/> [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] \"announced her plans to star in a film based on Frida's life\", and [[Robert De Niro]]'s [[Tribeca Productions]] reportedly \"envisioned a joint biography of [[Diego Rivera|Rivera]] and Kahlo.\"<ref name=\"Book LA\"/> In the spring of 1991, director [[Luis Valdez]] began production on a [[New Line]] feature about Frida Kahlo starring [[Laura San Giacomo]] in the lead. San Giacomo's casting received objections due to her non-[[Hispanic]] ethnicity, and New Line complied with the protesters' demands, and left the then-titled ''Frida and Diego'' in August 1992 citing finances.<ref name=\"Book LA\">[http://thebookla.com/s_2000_hayek.html The Book LA SUMMER 2000 Selma & Frida<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090113181511/http://thebookla.com/s_2000_hayek.html |date=2009-01-13 }}</ref> Hardin's project found itself swamped by similar ones:\n\n<blockquote>When I first tried to sell the project ... there was no interest because nobody had heard of Frida. A few years later, I heard the exact opposite{{spaced ndash}}that there were too many Frida projects in development, and nobody wanted mine.<ref name=\"Book LA\"/></blockquote>\n\nValdez was contacted early on by Salma Hayek, then unknown in the U.S., who sent \"her [promo] reel to the director and phoned his office\", but was ultimately told she was then too young for the role.<ref name=\"Writing\"/> By 1993, Valdez had retitled the film ''The Two Fridas'' with San Giacomo and [[Ofelia Medina]] both playing the portraitist.<ref>[https://www.variety.com/article/VR106879.html?categoryid=19&cs=1 Kahlo biopic gets new wakeup call{{spaced ndash}}Entertainment News, International News, Media{{spaced ndash}}Variety<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> [[Ra\u00fal Juli\u00e1]] was cast as Diego Rivera, but his death further delayed the movie. At the same time, Hardin approached [[HBO]], and with \"rising young development executive and producer\" Lizz Speed (a former assistant to [[Sherry Lansing]]) intended to make a [[television movie]], hopeful that [[Brian Gibson (director)|Brian Gibson]] (director of \"''[[What's Love Got to Do with It (1993 film)|What's Love Got to Do With It]]'', the story of [[Tina Turner]]\" and ''The [[Josephine Baker]] Story'') would direct.<ref name=\"Book LA\"/> Casting difficulties proved insurmountable, but Speed joined Hardin in advocating for the project, and after four years in [[Filmmaking#Development|development]], the two took the project from HBO to [[Trimark]] and producer [[Jay Polstein]] (with assistant [[Darlene Caama\u00f1o]]). At Trimark, [[Salma Hayek]] became interested in the role, having \"been fascinated by Kahlo's work from the time she was 13 or 14\"{{spaced ndash}}although not immediately a fan:\n\n{{blockquote|At that age I did not like her work ... I found it ugly and grotesque. But something intrigued me, and the more I learned, the more I started to appreciate her work. There was a lot of passion and depth. Some people see only pain, but I also see irony and humor. I think what draws me to her is what Diego saw in her. She was a fighter. Many things could have diminished her spirit, like the accident or Diego's infidelities. But she wasn't crushed by anything.<ref name=\"Book LA\"/>}}\n\nHayek was so determined to play the role that she sought out [[Dolores Olmedo|Dolores Olmedo Patino]], longtime-lover of Diego Rivera, and, after his death, administrator to the rights of Frida and Rivera's art, which Rivera had \"willed ... to the Mexican people\", bequeathing the trust to Olmedo.<ref name=\"Writing\"/> Hayek personally secured access to Kahlo's paintings from her, and began to assemble a supporting cast, approaching Alfred Molina for the role of Rivera in 1998. According to Molina, \"She turned up backstage [of the [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] play ''[['Art']]''] rather sheepishly, and asked if I would like to play Diego\". Molina went on to gain 35 pounds to play Rivera.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://film.guardian.co.uk/interview/interviewpages/0,,544397,00.html | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Jo | last=Tuckman | title=That Frida feeling | date=August 30, 2001}}</ref> When producer Polstein left Trimark, however, the production faltered again, and Hayek approached [[Harvey Weinstein]] and [[Miramax]], and the company purchased the film from Trimark; [[Julie Taymor]] came onto the project as director.
