Produced and distributed by [[Toho|Toho Co., Ltd.]], it is the fourth film in the [[Godzilla (franchise)|''Godzilla'' franchise]]. The film stars [[Akira Takarada]], [[Yuriko Hoshi]], [[Hiroshi Koizumi]], [[Kenji Sahara]], and [[The Peanuts|Emi and Yumi It\u014d]], with [[Haruo Nakajima]] and [[Katsumi Tezuka]] as [[Godzilla]]. In the film, humans beseech the aid of the insect god [[Mothra]] to stop Godzilla from destroying Japan.\n\nDue to the success of ''[[Mothra (film)|Mothra]]'' (1961) and ''[[King Kong vs. Godzilla]]'' (1962), Toho chose to pair Godzilla against Mothra for the following film. The film was intended for children as well as adults, as a way to compete with television's growing popularity in Japan. A new Godzilla suit and Mothra prop were built although the 1962 Godzilla suit was used for water scenes. At Tsuburaya's insistence, Toho purchased an [[Optical printer|Oxberry 1900 optical printer]] to remove damages in composite photography shots. It is the final film in the franchise's [[Godzilla (franchise)#Sh\u014dwa era (1954\u20131975)|Sh\u014dwa era]] to depict Godzilla as the antagonist.\n\n''Mothra vs. Godzilla'' was released theatrically in Japan on April 29, 1964. An edited version titled ''Godzilla vs. the Thing'' was released by [[American International Pictures]] in the United States on August 26, 1964. The film received generally positive reviews from early and contemporary American critics. American film historians have praised the film's themes of unity, greed, and Honda's depiction of Godzilla as a \"specter of nuclear annihilation\" and a symbol of moral judgement.{{sfn|Ryfle|1998|p=105}}\n\nThe film was followed by ''[[Ghidorah, the Three-Headed Monster]]'', released on December 20, 1964.\n\n==Plot==\nKurata Beach is stricken by a typhoon. The following morning, reporter Ichiro Saki and his photographer Junko Nakanishi find a strange blue-gray object amongst the wreckage. Later, a giant egg is found floating near Nishi Beach in Shizunoura. Professor Miura attempts to investigate the egg, only to be pestered with questions by Saki. They soon learn that the villagers had sold the egg to businessman Kumayama for exploitation purposes for his firm Happy Enterprises. At a local hotel, Saki, Junko, and Miura discuss how to legally counter Kumayama's plans, and find him at the lobby. Kumayama meets with his financial backer Jiro Torahata, who reveals his plans to build the Shizunoura Happy Center around the egg. They are visited by the [[Mothra#Mothra's fairies|Shobijin]], tiny twin fairies, who attempt to convince them to return the egg but have to escape when the businessmen try to capture them. The Shobijin run into Saki, Junko, and Miura, and reveal to them that the egg belongs to the colossal insect god [[Mothra]], the recent typhoon caused it to wash up on Japanese waters, and destruction will follow when the larva emerges. The trio agree to help them retrieve the egg, and try to plead with Kumayama and Torahata but are met with resistance. The Shobijin eventually return home to Infant Island without the egg.\n\nLater, Saki writes scathing articles about Happy Enterprises' insensitivity towards the Shobijin. However, the firm dismisses the articles as slander and open the Shizunoura Happy Center to the public. Kumayama is confronted by the villagers for not paying in full for the egg and renting from their land. Torahata agrees to loan Kumayama additional funds in exchange for putting the egg up as collateral. Kumayama reluctantly accepts and begins incubating the egg. Miura decontaminates Saki and Junko after touching the object they found in the wreckage, revealing it to be highly radioactive. The trio return to Kurata beach to investigate further, but the giant reptilian monster [[Godzilla]] emerges from the buried mud. Citizens evacuate as Godzilla wrecks havoc on [[Yokkaichi]] and [[Nagoya]]. The [[Japan Self-Defense Forces]] (JSDF) are deployed to lead Godzilla to the coast to minimize casualties.\n\nAt the suggestion from a colleague, the trio travel to Infant Island to appeal with the Shobijin for Mothra's help. When they arrive, they are horrified by the desolation left behind by past nuclear tests. They are captured by the natives and reveal their intentions to ask for Mothra's help against Godzilla. The Shobijin and natives refuse, seeing it as divine retribution on outsiders for ravaging their island with nuclear tests, and not returning the egg. Junko and Saki plead that the innocent are also in danger, that they have no right to decide which lives deserve salvation, and that civilization is flawed, but is trying hard to make the world better. Mothra agrees to help, but the Shobijin warn that she is on her deathbed.\n\nBack in Japan, the JSDF launch multiple campaigns against Godzilla but to no avail. After losing his finances, Kumayama confronts Torahata at his hotel, attacks him, and steals his secret funds. Torahata shoots Kumayama, and attempts to escape with the money but is crushed as Godzilla destroys the hotel. Godzilla reaches Nishi Beach, and prepares to destroy the egg until Mothra intervenes and engages Godzilla in battle. Mothra initially gets the upper hand, but is defeated by Godzilla's atomic breath. Mothra uses her last strength to fly to the egg and die next to it.\n\nAs the JSDF resume their attacks on Godzilla, the trio and the Shobijin remain with the egg as the twins attempt to make the egg hatch quicker via musical incantations. Twin larvae emerge from the egg and follow Godzilla to Iwa island. As the monsters battle, the trio join a rescue party to retrieve students and their teacher left behind on Iwa Island. Godzilla is entrapped by the larva's silk, tumbles into the sea and sinks. The students and teacher are returned to safety, and the larvae and Shobijin return to Infant Island. Saki asserts that humanity will thank them by building a better world.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Akira Takarada]] as Ichiro Sakai\n* [[Yuriko Hoshi]] as Junko Nakanishi\n* [[Hiroshi Koizumi]] as Professor Shunsuke Miura\n* [[Y\u016b Fujiki]] as Jiro Nakamura\n* [[The Peanuts|Emi and Yumi It\u014d]] as the Shobijin\n* [[Kenji Sahara]] as Jiro Torahata\n* [[Jun Tazaki]] as Maruta\n* [[Yoshifumi Tajima]] as Kumayama\n* Akira Tani as Amimoto, the village leader<ref name=\"Toho\"/>\n* Ikio Sawamura as a ''[[kannushi]]''<ref name=\"Toho\"/>\n* [[Haruo Nakajima]] as [[Godzilla]]\n* [[Katsumi Tezuka]] as Godzilla<ref name=\"Toho\">{{cite web|url=http://toho.co.jp/library/system/movies/?824|title=\u30e2\u30b9\u30e9\u5bfe\u30b4\u30b8\u30e9|work=[[Toho]]|language=Japanese|access-date=March 22, 2022|url-status=dead|archive-date=March 25, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160325164645/http://toho.co.jp/library/system/movies/?824}}</ref>\n}}\nCast taken from ''Japan's Favorite Mon-Star'',{{sfn|Ryfle|1998|p=353\u2013354}} except where cited otherwise.\n\n==Themes==\nThe film historian Steve Ryfle calls ''Mothra vs. Godzilla'' a \"classic good-versus-evil stand-off\".{{sfn|Ryfle|1998|p=105}} He says the film raises philosophical questions about unity and humanity's will to put aside their differences for the greater good. Ryfle refers to Godzilla as a \"specter of nuclear annihilation\",{{sfn|Ryfle|1998|p=105}} metaphorically casting its shadow over Japan. Ryle also describes Godzilla as a symbol of moral judgement after indirectly killing the film's villains.{{sfn|Ryfle|1998|p=105}} The director [[Ishir\u014d Honda]] had directed the original ''[[Godzilla (1954 film)|Godzilla]]'' (1954) and ''[[Mothra (1961 film)|Mothra]]'' (1961) films, and the actor [[Hiroshi Koizumi]] said Honda was able to emphasize his themes better through Mothra than Godzilla, stating, \"Mothra's role was a messenger of peace\".{{sfn|Ryfle|Godziszewski|2017|p=208}} [[Kenji Sahara]] said his character Torahata symbolized greed.{{sfn|Ryfle|Godziszewski|2017|p=208}} Honda purposely chose to portray the film's version of Infant Island as a partial wasteland as a way to \"visualize the terror and the power of the atomic bomb\".{{sfn|Ryfle|Godziszewski|2017|p=211}}\n\nThe film historian David Kalat writes that the film brings the shame of civilized man to the forefront, and says that the film's Japanese character do little to nothing to return Mothra's egg yet travel to Infant Island to ask Mothra for more. Kalat writes that Mothra is the first to respond to Saki's speech about the brotherhood between mankind, adding that Mothra \"possesses a more developed faculty of forgiveness than her subjects,\"{{sfn|Kalat|2010|p=68\u201369}} thus making Mothra \"morally and spiritually superior\" than humans.{{sfn|Kalat|2010|p=68\u201369}}\n\n==Production==\n===Crew===\n{{Div col|colwidth=27em}}\n* [[Ishir\u014d Honda]]{{efn|Credited as \"Inoshiro Honda\" in the American version of the film.<ref name=\"Inoshiro\">{{cite web|last=Nakajima|first=Shinsuke|url=http://ishirohonda.com/messages/staff/s0020_nakajima002.html|title=\u30a4\u30b7\u30ed\u30a6\u3001\u305d\u308c\u3068\u3082\u30a4\u30ce\u30b7\u30ed\u30a6\uff1f|website=IshiroHonda.com|language=Japanese|date=May 7, 2013|access-date=April 3, 2022|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210513071240/http://ishirohonda.com/messages/staff/s0020_nakajima002.html|archive-date=May 13, 2021}}</ref>}} \u2013 director\n* [[Eiji Tsuburaya]] \u2013 special effects director\n* K\u014dji Kajita \u2013 assistant director\n* Boku Norimoto \u2013 production coordinator\n* Sadamasa Arikawa \u2013 special effects photography\n* [[Akira Watanabe (art director)|Akira Watanabe]] \u2013 special effects art director\n* Takeo Kita \u2013 art director\n* Hiroshi Mukoyama \u2013 optical effects\n{{Div col end}}\nPersonnel taken from ''Japan's Favorite Mon-Star''.{{sfn|Ryfle|1998|p=354}}\n\n===Development===\nAfter having success with ''[[King Kong vs. Godzilla]]'' (1962), [[Toho|Toho Co., Ltd.]] wanted to pair Godzilla with another popular monster and chose Mothra, the title character of a successful 1961 film.{{sfn|Ryfle|1998|p=103}} Honda and Toho aimed the film towards a general audience due to the rise of television at the time. To prepare for his role, Sahara spent time around \"pushy\" real-estate agents by posing as a buyer.{{sfn|Ryfle |Godziszewski|2017|p=208}} Tanaka cast the twin sisters Emi and Yumi It\u014d as the Shobijin due to their popularity as the singing duo [[The Peanuts]], as this would create publicity for the film.{{sfn|Ryfle|Godziszewski|2007|loc=00:13:28}}\n\nThe story in ''Mothra vs. Godzilla'' was originally intended to pick up after ''Mothra'', with the Rolisicans, the fictional people of the fictional country Rolisica, re-cast as the villains.{{sfn|Ryfle|1998|p=105}} The screenwriter [[Shinichi Sekizawa]]'s earlier drafts have several key difference from the final version: the villain Torahata did not exist; Sakai was accompanied by two scientists, a colleague and a friend's mentor; Godzilla's body washes ashore rather than Mothra's egg; the leads offer themselves as hostages to the Infant Island natives in exchange for Mothra's help; Rolisica was to be attacked by Godzilla; the Frontier Missiles were to be used by the Rolisican military; Himeji Castle was to be destroyed; Godzilla was to move East until reaching close to Tokyo; The artificial lightning tactic is conceived when Godzilla is repelled by electrical towers in Tokyo; Mothra attacks Godzilla when he becomes immune to electricity; Mothra engages Godzilla in a final battle when he stalks the lead characters on a beach. Honda changed much of Sekizawa's original script to accommodate his own vision.{{sfn|Ryfle|1998|p=111}} Saki's speech about the brotherhood of man was not in Sekizawa's script, but was later added by Honda during filming.{{sfn|Kalat|2010|p=69}} The film marks the last time Godzilla is depicted as the antagonist during the franchise's [[Godzilla (franchise)#Sh\u014dwa era (1954\u20131975)|Sh\u014dwa era]].{{sfn|Ryfle|Godziszewski|2017|p=206}}\n\n===Music===\nThe [[film score]] was composed by [[Akira Ifukube]].{{sfn|Ryfle|Godziszewski|2017|p=209}} Ifukube adapted elements from [[Yuji Koseki]]'s \"Song of Mothra\" theme from the 1961 film into his score. Honda and Ifukube were regular collaborators and held planning sessions to discuss which scenes would feature music. They had a disagreement over a scene which featured Godzilla rising behind a ridge-line. Honda asked for aggressive music for the scene but Ifukube refused, feeling that it was unnecessary due to Godzilla being \"impressive enough\".{{sfn|Ryfle|Godziszewski|2017|p=210}} Godzilla's theme was eventually added to the scene, which upset Ifukube.{{sfn|Ryfle|Godziszewski|2017|p=210}} The track \"The Sacred Springs\" was the only track Ifukube wrote for The Peanuts and was intended to lament Infant Island's destruction.{{sfn|Ryfle|Godziszewski|2007|loc=00:46:02}}{{sfn|Ryfle|Godziszewski|2007|loc=00:47:05}} For the 1980 re-release, the Japanese pop and rock band [[Talizman]] recorded a new song simply titled \"Godzilla\", which was later included as a bonus feature on Toho's 2014 Blu-ray.{{sfn|Nakamura|Shiraishi|Aita|Tomoi|2014|p=169}}\n\n===Special effects===\n''Mothra vs. Godzilla''{{'}}s special effects were directed by [[Eiji Tsuburaya]]. [[Teruyoshi Nakano]] served as the assistant special effects director.{{sfn|Kalat|2010|p=67}} Mechanical props and puppets were built for both monsters.{{sfn|Ryfle|1998|p=107}} The Godzilla suit was constructed by Teizo Toshimitsu two months prior to filming, with input from the actor [[Haruo Nakajima]] whenever he visited the workshop. The new suit was lighter than previous ones and allowed Nakajima to make more fluid movement. Reinforced heels gave Nakajima freedom to roll and flip without losing his footing.{{sfn|Ryfle|1998|p=108}} The 1962 Godzilla suit was recycled for water scenes and a shot with Godzilla tumbling off a cliff.{{sfn|Ryfle|Godziszewski|2007|loc=01:18:57}} For Mothra, a new prop was built, similar to the 1961 prop, with Y-shaped braces attached to the back that allowed the wings to flap. High-powered fans were used to create wind for Mothra's wings.{{sfn|Ryfle|1998|p=108}} The wing-span for the new Mothra prop was 15 feet.{{sfn|Ryfle|Godziszewski|2007|loc=00:51:55}} Mechanisms were added that allowed the prop's head and legs to move via remote control.{{sfn|Ryfle|Godziszewski|2007|loc=00:52:06}}\n\nThe larvae were a combination of hand puppetry and motor-driven mechanical props. The larvae's web was made of liquified [[polystyrene]]. When the web was shot off-screen, it was poured onto a cup stationed at the center of a heavy industrial fan. The cup was sealed with small gaps around the edges.{{sfn|Ryfle|Godziszewski|2007|loc=01:23:56}} To shoot the web out of the larvae's mouths, [[compressed air]] was run into a sealed tube of liquid polystyrene. At a high pressure level, the liquid polystyrene was forced through a tube that ran through the back of the larvae and into [[nozzle]]s in their mouths. As long as the nozzle was small, the solution vaporized when first emitted and solidified into the web.{{sfn|Ryfle|Godziszewski|2007|loc=01:24:42}} Gasoline had to be used to remove the webbing and the suit had to be thoroughly dried to prevent it from combusting.{{sfn|Ryfle|Godziszewski|2007|loc=01:25:23}}\n\nThe larva movements were designed by Soujiro Iijima and used a [[conveyor belt]] with rotating gears that allowed the bodies to move up and down.{{sfn|Ryfle|Godziszewski|2007|loc=01:19:12}} For the scenes with the Shobijin, furniture eight times their size was built to make the Shobijin appear to be 30 centimeters tall.{{sfn|Ryfle|1998|p=107}} Honda originally intended to depict the wasteland part of Infant Island with more realism and graphic imagery but this idea was dropped due to budgetary issues with the art department. Honda later regretted this decision, saying he should have been more stubborn.{{sfn|Ryfle|Godziszewski|2017|p=211}}\n\nTsuburaya had Toho purchase an [[optical printer|Oxberry 1900 optical printer]] which was used to remove damages in [[composite photography]] shots. The optical printer was also used to create Godzilla's atomic breath. For a scene where Godzilla destroys [[Nagoya Castle]], Nakajima was unable to completely destroy the model of the castle. He attempted to salvage the shot by having Godzilla appear enraged by the Castle's strong fortification, but the filmmakers chose to re-shoot the scene with a rebuilt model designed to crumble more easily. For a scene where Mothra drags Godzilla by the tail, the Godzilla suit was used for medium shots and a prop used for long shots.{{sfn|Ryfle|1998|p=108}} A sequence featuring the [[United States Armed Forces|United States military]] attacking Godzilla with frontier missiles was filmed for the American market, but omitted in the Japanese version of the film.{{sfn|Ryfle|Godziszewski|2017|p=209}}{{sfn|Iwabatake|Ono|1992|p=74}}\n\nThe Mothra prop used for the New Kirk City scenes in ''Mothra'' was recycled for the Infant Island scenes. This prop was smaller compared to the prop built for the new film's adult Mothra. The 1961 model had a motor built into it that flapped the wings at a rapid pace.{{sfn|Ryfle|Godziszewski|2007|loc=00:51:02}} For the scenes with Godzilla near the cliff face, part of the set's support structure was hidden by using matte painting.{{sfn|Ryfle|Godziszewski|2007|loc=00:53:35}} The miniature tanks used in the film were purchased from Ihara models rather than typically custom built. The tank models were built to a 1/15th scale and were constructed from aluminum. The antennas were used for remote control.{{sfn|Ryfle|Godziszewski|2007|loc=00:54:14}}\n\nFor the scene where Godzilla destroys the incubator, the scene proved difficult for Nakajima and the wire staff, which required coordination. Close ups of the tail were done with a prop that was operated by two people due to the heavy weight of the tail.{{sfn|Ryfle|Godziszewski|2007|loc=00:58:47}} The scenes with Godzilla thrashing wildly at Mothra were shot at high speed, then projected at a quicker speed. The end results have been compared to the movement of [[stop-motion animation]].{{sfn|Ryfle|Godziszewski|2007|loc=01:03:11}} The scene with Godzilla thrashing from the nets was shot with different cameras at once and as a result, the same scene plays over from different angles.{{sfn|Ryfle|Godziszewski|2007|loc=01:12:16}}\n\nA second egg was produced for the hatching scene. A styrofoam egg was molded and a [[calcium carbonate]] substance was mixed with glue and added on top. The styrofoam egg was removed from its interior with a heated wire, which left a hollow form.{{sfn|Ryfle|Godziszewski|2007|loc=01:16:29}} For the opening typhoon scene, Iijima built a shallow water tank to create the illusion of violent waves. Wider water scenes were filmed at massive pool at Toho's studios.{{sfn|Ryfle|Godziszewski|2007|loc=01:19:37}}\n\nRubber glue was blown onto Godzilla's suit by an electric fan for the scene where Mothra's larvae entrap him in silk. In the process of filming, the rubber glue hardened, making it difficult to remove afterwards.{{sfn|Mamiya|2000|p=97}}\n\n==Release==\n===Theatrical===\n''Mothra vs. Godzilla'' was released in Japan by [[Toho]] on April 29, 1964,{{sfn|Kalat|2010|p=67}} as a [[double feature]] with ''Operation Anti Hell''.{{sfn|Motoyama|Matsunomoto|Asai|Suzuki|2012|p=78}} Prior to the [[Golden Week (Japan)|Golden Week]], it sold 3.5 million tickets.{{sfn|Ryfle |Godziszewski|2017|p=211}} According to [[Henry G.
