It was written by [[Jeremy Brock]] and directed by [[John Madden (director)|John Madden]]. The film was produced by the [[BBC]] and [[Ecosse Films]] with the intention of being shown on [[BBC One]] and on [[WGBH-TV|WGBH]]'s ''[[Masterpiece Theatre]]''. However, it was acquired by [[Miramax]] and released to unexpected success, going on to earn over $13 million worldwide.\n\nThe film was screened in the [[Un Certain Regard]] section at the [[1997 Cannes Film Festival]] and released in the United Kingdom on 5 September 1997.<ref name=\"festival-cannes.com\">{{cite web |url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/4836/year/1997.html |title=Festival de Cannes: Mrs Brown |access-date=27 September 2009|work=festival-cannes.com}}</ref> Judi Dench won the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Motion Picture - Drama]] and the [[BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role]]; additionally, she was nominated for many other awards for her performance, including the [[Academy Award for Best Actress]] and the [[Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Leading Role]], but lost both awards to [[Helen Hunt]] for her role in ''[[As Good as It Gets]]''.\n\n==Plot==\n{{Anchor|Synopsis}}\nThe film shows the story of a recently widowed [[Queen Victoria]] and her relationship with a [[Scotland|Scottish]] servant, [[John Brown (servant)|John Brown]], a trusted servant of her deceased husband, and the subsequent uproar it provoked. Brown had served Victoria's Prince Consort, [[Albert, Prince Consort|Prince Albert]]; Victoria's Household thought Brown might help the Queen who had remained in mourning since the Prince Consort's death in 1861.\n\nIn 1863, hoping to subtly coax the Queen toward resuming public life after years of seclusion, Brown is summoned to court. The plan succeeds a little too well for the liking of Victoria's Chief Secretary Sir [[Henry Ponsonby]] and [[Edward VII|The Prince of Wales]] as well as other members of the [[British Royal Family|Royal Family]]; the public, press and politicians soon come to resent Brown's perceived influence over Victoria. Brown takes considerable liberties with court protocol, especially by addressing Her Majesty as ''\"woman\"''. He also quickly takes control over the Queen's daily activities, further aggravating the tensions between himself and the Royal Family and servants.\n\nThe [[moniker]] ''\"Mrs Brown\"'', used both at the time and in the film, implied an improper, and perhaps sexual, relationship. The film does not directly address the contemporary suspicions that Victoria and Brown had had a sexual relationship and perhaps had even secretly married, though cartoons from the satirical magazine ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'' are shown as being passed around in Parliament (one cartoon is revealed to the camera, showing an empty throne, with the sceptre lying unhanded across it).\n\nAs a result of Victoria's seclusion, especially at [[Balmoral Castle]] in Scotland (something initially encouraged by Brown), her popularity begins failing and [[republicanism|republican]] sentiment begins growing. Prime Minister [[Benjamin Disraeli]]'s hold over the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] is weakening and there is a fear of rising anti-monarchical sentiment in the country. He convinces Brown to use his influence with Victoria to persuade her to return to the performance of her public duties, especially the [[speech from the throne]] at the opening of Parliament.\n\nBrown is reluctant to do so, rightly fearing that Victoria will take this as a personal betrayal. When he urges her to return to London and fulfil her public duties, an argument ensues. Feeling betrayed by Brown, Victoria becomes visibly agitated. When Brown once again refers to her as ''\"woman\"'', she sharply rebukes him. Leaving the room, she turns to Ponsonby and Jenner requesting that they serve her needs, visibly demoting Brown's contact and influence. Their relationship was never to be the same again. Victoria's eventual acquiescence and her decision to return to public life leads to a revitalization of her popularity and a resurgence in public support of the monarchy.\n\nBrown continues to serve Victoria until his death in 1883. In his final years, his duties become reduced to head of security. The palace staff has become weary of Brown's dogmatic ways and they mock and rebuke his security efforts as paranoid delusions. Finally, during a public event, a gun-wielding assassin appears out of the crowd leaping toward the Royal Family. An ever-vigilant Brown successfully thwarts the assassination attempt. At dinner the next evening, the Prince of Wales retells the story, bragging to their dinner companions that he had been the one to warn Brown of the assassin. Seeing through her son's bragging, Victoria announces instead that a special medal for bravery, the \"Devoted Service Medal,\" will be minted and awarded to Brown.\n\nYears later, Brown becomes gravely ill with pneumonia after running through the woods late at night chasing a possible intruder. Hearing of his illness, Victoria visits his room and is shaken to see her old friend so ill. She confesses that she has not been as good a friend as she might have been in recent years, and the pneumonia proves fatal for Brown. During his years of service, Brown had kept a diary and, upon his passing, Ponsonby and Jenner discuss its contents stating that it must never be seen by anyone.\n\nThe film's closing notes state ''\"John Brown's diary was never found.\"'' Jenner also reveals that the Prince of Wales hurled the Queen's favourite bust of Brown over the palace wall, referencing the film's opening sequence.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Judi Dench]] as [[Queen Victoria]]\n* [[Billy Connolly]] as [[John Brown (servant)|John Brown]]\n* [[Geoffrey Palmer (actor)|Geoffrey Palmer]] as [[Henry Ponsonby]]\n* [[Antony Sher]] as Prime Minister [[Benjamin Disraeli]]\n* [[Gerard Butler]] as Archie Brown\n* [[David Westhead]] as [[Edward VII|Bertie, Prince of Wales]]\n* [[Richard Pasco]] as [[Sir William Jenner, 1st Baronet|Dr. Jenner]]\n* Bridget McConnell as [[Jane Loftus, Marchioness of Ely|Lady Ely]]\n* [[Georgie Glen]] as [[Jane Spencer, Baroness Churchill|Lady Churchill]]\n* [[Catherine O'Donnell]] as [[Elizabeth Wellesley, Duchess of Wellington|Lady in waiting]]\n\n==Reception==\n===Critical reception===\nOn [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] the film has an approval rating of 92% based on 50 reviews, with an average rating of 7.3/10.
