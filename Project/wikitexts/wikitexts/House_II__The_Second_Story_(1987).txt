It serves as the second installment in the [[House (film series)|''House'' film series]], and is a standalone sequel to [[House (1986 film)|the first movie]]. While the plots and characters are unrelated, ''House II'' involves a storyline centered around a new mansion with a supernatural connection. The tone is highlighted with a greater focus on comedy, with a tone even lighter than the original.\n\n''House II: The Second Story'' was released on August 28, 1987, grossing $10 million worldwide against a $3 million budget and received negative reviews from critics.\n\n==Plot==\nYoung urban professionals Jesse McLaughlin ([[Arye Gross]]) and his girlfriend Kate ([[Lar Park Lincoln]]) move into an old mansion that has been in Jesse's family for generations. They are soon joined by Jesse's goofy friend Charlie Coriell ([[Jonathan Stark (actor)|Jonathan Stark]]), who brought along his diva girlfriend Lana ([[Amy Yasbeck]]), in the hopes of being discovered by Kate, who works for a record company.\n\nJesse has returned to the old family mansion after his parents were murdered when he was a baby. While going through old things in the basement, Jesse finds a picture of his great-great-grandfather (and namesake) in front of an [[Aztec]] temple holding a [[crystal skull]] with sapphires in the eyes. In the background is a man Jesse learns is Slim Reeser, a former partner of his great-great-grandfather turned bitter enemy after a disagreement over who would get to keep the skull.\n\nReasoning that the skull must be buried with him, Jesse and Charlie decide to dig up Jesse's great-great-grandfather in the hopes of procuring the skull. They unearth the casket only to be attacked by the corpse ([[Royal Dano]]), who then shows himself to be friendly when Jesse reveals his identity as the senior Jesse's great-great-grandson. Jesse and Charlie take the cowboy zombie, nicknamed \"Gramps\", back to the house, where he is horrified to learn that the skull has not rejuvenated his body as he had hoped.\n\nGramps and Charlie go out drinking and driving, and later the boys listen for hours to Gramps' stories of the [[Old West]] and his outlaw life. Gramps explains that the house was built using stones from the Aztec temple, and that its rooms act as a hidden doorway across space and time, with the skull acting as a key. He charges Charlie and Jesse with defending the skull against the forces of evil, who are drawn to possess the skull.\n\nDuring an impromptu Halloween party thrown by Charlie, Gramps makes an appearance (though he is overlooked as it is a costume party), Kate leaves Jesse (taking Lana with her) after he is seen with an old girlfriend by her smarmy boss John Statman ([[Bill Maher]]), and Jesse and Charlie pick up two new pets in the [[Jurassic]] era, a baby [[pterodactyl]] and a caterpillar-dog that's dubbed a Cater-Puppy, after a barbarian/caveman arrives at the party and steals the skull.\n\nBill Towner ([[John Ratzenberger]]), an electrician and \"part-time adventurer\", arrives to inspect the house's old wiring. While seemingly a buffoon, he pulls a short-sword from his tool case and leads the boys through \"one of those time-portal things...you see these all the time in these old houses.\" In the mystic past, the three fight off a group of Aztec warriors and rescue an Aztec virgin who was about to be sacrificed.\n\nEventually, a zombified Slim Reeser makes his appearance. Still after the skull, Slim shoots Gramps who then gives Jesse his guns and reveals that it was Slim who shot and killed Jesse's parents when he was a baby. Jesse jumps through a window into the Old West, and eventually succeeds in killing Slim by blasting off his head with a rifle (or, maybe, a shotgun). Gramps, who has been mortally wounded, begins to pass away. Gramps says goodbye to Jesse and tells him he is so happy to have met his great-great-grandson. Gramps then gives a final warning about the power of the skull, encouraging Jesse to get what he wants from the enchanted object and then get rid of it. As Gramps passes, Jesse embraces him.\n\nThe film ends with the revelation that Jesse used the skull to travel back into the Old West, where he, Charlie and the rest of their friends drive off in a wagon on a new adventure, leaving the crystal skull behind, marking Gramps' new grave.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Arye Gross]] as Jesse McLaughlin\n* [[Jonathan Stark (actor)|Jonathan Stark]] as Charlie Coriell\n* [[Royal Dano]] as Gramps McLaughlin\n* [[Bill Maher]] as John Statmen\n* [[John Ratzenberger]] as Bill Towner\n* [[Lar Park Lincoln]] as Kate\n* [[Amy Yasbeck]] as Lana aka Puce Glitz\n* [[Dwier Brown]] as Clarence\n* [[Gregory Walcott]] as Sheriff\n* [[Jayne Modean]] as Rochelle\n* Lenora May as Judith\n* [[Kane Hodder]] as Gorilla (also stunt coordinator)\n* [[Frank Welker]] as the voices of Slim Reeser, Baby Pterodactyl and Cater Puppy\n* [[Devin DeVasquez]] as the virgin\n\n==Reception==\nOn [[Rotten Tomatoes]] the film has an approval rating of 9% based on reviews from 11 critics.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://rottentomatoes.com/m/house_2_the_second_story/ |title=House II: The Second Story |work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |access-date= July 21, 2019 }}</ref>\n\nRyan Pollard at ''[[Starburst (magazine)|Starburst]]'' wrote: \"''House II'' doesn't quite have anything similar to the strong performance of the original's Bill Katt anchoring the picture, but it still has plenty to make it a worthwhile follow-up that's definitely worth watching.\".<ref>{{cite web |title=HOUSE II: THE SECOND STORY |url=https://www.starburstmagazine.com/reviews/house-ii-second-story |website=STARBURST Magazine}}</ref> Creature Feature gave the movie two of five stars, finding it inferior to the first movie.<ref>Stanley, J.
