Directed by [[John Schlesinger]], it stars [[Tom Courtenay]] (who had understudied [[Albert Finney]] in the West End theatre adaptation of the novel) as Billy and [[Julie Christie]] as Liz, one of his three girlfriends. [[Mona Washbourne]] plays Mrs. Fisher and [[Wilfred Pickles]] plays Mr. Fisher. [[Rodney Bewes]], [[Finlay Currie]] and [[Leonard Rossiter]] also feature. The [[Cinemascope]] photography is by [[Denys Coop]] and [[Richard Rodney Bennett]] supplied the score.\n\nThe film belongs to the [[British New Wave]], inspired by both the earlier [[kitchen sink realism]] movement and the [[French New Wave]]. Characteristic of the style is a [[documentary film|documentary]]/''[[cin\u00e9ma v\u00e9rit\u00e9]]'' feel and the use of real locations (in this case, many in the city of [[Bradford]] in [[Yorkshire]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.reelstreets.com/index.php/component/films_online/?task=view&id=73&film_ref=billy_liar|title=Reel Streets|website=www.reelstreets.com|access-date=24 November 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170620014225/http://reelstreets.com/index.php/component/films_online/?task=view&id=73&film_ref=billy_liar|archive-date=20 June 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>). <!-- (\"pissed\" is slang for inebriated) One sequence includes a very early use of a swear word (\"pissed\"), which was unusual by commercial film standards of the time; the word is uttered by Mona Washbourne.-->\n\nThe film opened at the [[Vue West End|Warner Theatre]] in London's West End on 15 August 1963.<ref>The Times, 15 August 1963, p.  2</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n\nBilly Fisher ([[Tom Courtenay]]) lives in Yorkshire with his parents ([[Wilfred Pickles]] and [[Mona Washbourne]]) and grandmother ([[Ethel Griffies]]). Billy wishes to get away from his stifling job and family life. To escape the boredom of his humdrum existence, he constantly daydreams and fantasizes, often picturing himself as the ruler and military hero of an imaginary country called Ambrosia. In his fantasies, he gives speeches to large crowds in a manner resembling Hitler or Mussolini. He makes up stories about himself and his family, causing him to be nicknamed \"Billy Liar\". In reality, he lives in a lower-middle-class home with parents who constantly scold and nag him about his behaviour.\n\nBilly works as an undertakers' clerk overseen by the rigid Mr. Shadrack ([[Leonard Rossiter]]). At work, he is tasked with mailing out a large shipment of advertising calendars to potential customers, but instead hides the calendars and keeps the postage money. When he notices the calendars in his wardrobe, he dreams of being imprisoned in [[Wormwood Scrubs]] for the crime of pocketing the postage money. He is eventually found out by Shadrack, who refuses to let him resign from his position until he pays back the postage money.\n\nBilly aspires to get a more interesting job as a scriptwriter for comic Danny Boon ([[Leslie Randall (actor)|Leslie Randall]]), but when Boon comes to town, he is not interested in Billy's overtures. However, Billy tells everyone that Boon is very interested in his stories and that he will be moving to London very soon. Whenever Billy experiences something unpleasant, such as his parents scolding him or his boss harassing him, he imagines himself to be somewhere else. His fantasies generally involve himself as a hero with everyone very pleased with him. However, Billy shows himself to be happier fantasizing about being a great success than actually taking a risk to make something of himself.\n\nBilly has further complicated his life by proposing to two very different girls, the sheltered, virginal Barbara ([[Helen Fraser (actress)|Helen Fraser]]) and the tough, brassy Rita ([[Gwendolyn Watts]]). He has given the same engagement ring to each girl and lies constantly to get it back from one and give it to the other. Rita discovers he has lied about the ring being at the jeweller's and shows up at Billy's door but he lies to her again and she leaves. When Billy's father questions him about what he is doing with Rita, Billy yells at him and his shocked grandmother begins gasping for breath and has to lie down. Billy feels guilty but imagines himself as a general winning a difficult war.\n\nBilly also finds himself attracted to his former girlfriend Liz ([[Julie Christie]]), who has just returned to town from [[Doncaster]]. Liz is a free spirit who, unlike anyone else in town, understands and accepts Billy's imagination. However, she has more courage and confidence than Billy, as shown by her willingness to leave her home town and enjoy new and different experiences. Under pressure, Billy ends up making dates with both Barbara and Rita to meet each one on the same night at the same local ballroom. There, the two girls discover the double engagement and begin fighting with each other. All of Billy's lies seem to catch up with him as it's announced publicly that he is moving to London to work with Danny Boon, and Billy's friend scolds him for lying to his mother.\n\nDistraught, Billy encounters Liz outside and shares a romantic interlude with her, during which he shares his fantasies about Ambrosia. He proposes marriage to her and she accepts. She urges him to accompany her to London that evening, and he goes home to pack his bags, only to find his grandmother has fallen ill and been taken to hospital. Billy gets into an argument with his father, who has found out about Billy's problems at work and trashed Billy's room. Billy joins his mother at the hospital just in time to learn his grandmother has died. He then continues to the station to meet Liz, and the couple board the train, but at the last minute Billy disembarks with the excuse of buying some milk to drink on the journey. He delays returning to the train, and by the time he gets back it is pulling out, with an understanding Liz at the window and his suitcase left behind on the platform. Alone, Billy walks the dark deserted road back to his home, imagining himself leading the marching army of Ambrosia. Billy enters the house closing the door behind him. As the main floor lights can be seen turned off and as Billy's bedroom lights upstairs can be seen turned on, the camera pans away from the house as the national anthem of Ambrosia starts playing.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Tom Courtenay]] as William Terrence Fisher\n* [[Wilfred Pickles]] as Geoffrey Fisher\n* [[Mona Washbourne]] as Alice Fisher\n* [[Ethel Griffies]] as Florence, Billy's grandmother\n* [[Finlay Currie]] as Duxbury\n* [[Gwendolyn Watts]] as Rita\n* [[Helen Fraser (actress)|Helen Fraser]] as Barbara\n* [[Julie Christie]] as Liz\n* [[Leonard Rossiter]] as Emanuel Shadrack\n* [[Rodney Bewes]] as Arthur Crabtree\n* [[George Innes]] as Stamp\n* [[Leslie Randall (actor)|Leslie Randall]] as Danny Boon\n* [[Patrick Barr]] as Inspector MacDonald\n* [[Ernest Clark]] as Prison governor\n\n==Awards and recognition==\nThe film marked the breakthrough role of Julie Christie, who was nominated for a [[BAFTA Awards|BAFTA award]] for her performance as Liz.
