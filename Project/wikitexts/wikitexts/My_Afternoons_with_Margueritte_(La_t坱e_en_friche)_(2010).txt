As a child, he was bullied at school for being a slow reader, by both the teachers and other students. His mother kept reminding him that he was clumsy and an unwanted child, and did not give him much love. He is a loyal man, with a good heart. He lives in a trailer he parks close to his mother's house, where he cultivates a vegetable garden. He earns some extra money by selling his vegetables at the weekly farmers' market, borrowing a truck from the bar where he is a regular customer with his friends. His girl friend Annette is a younger woman who drives the local bus; she truly loves this sweet, simple and loving man.\n\nOne afternoon Germain meets Margueritte, a delicate, 95-year-old woman who sits on the same bench with him to feed pigeons. He has observed the 19 birds so often that he knows each and has named them. He sees that she is highly educated, and learns she had worked as a scientist with the [[World Health Organization]]. She lives in a retirement home in the village and reads frequently. They connect over a text from ''[[The Plague (novel)|The Plague]]'' by [[Albert Camus]]. Because  Germain is barely literate, Margueritte starts to read the book aloud to him. Slowly he starts to appreciate the beauty of words and sentences, because he is a good listener and he has a vivid imagination. Germain is affected by the symbolism Camus uses in this [[philosophical novel]], expanding his horizons. The pair meet every day to continue their reading sessions. A friendship develops. Margueritte eventually gives him her old dictionary. In it he tries to find words that he's interested in, but because he can't spell, he finds the dictionary too frustrating. He decides to return it when Margueritte invites him to her place for tea.\n\nShe tells him that her eyesight is gradually fading, and that she will soon no longer be able to walk unassisted. Germain decides to reverse roles and try to read to her, but first he must improve his reading skills. With Annette's support he learns to read a story aloud to Margueritte. Shortly thereafter, Germain finds his mother dead at home, and is distraught.\n\nAt the notary, he learns that his mother owned her house, which he had thought she rented. She had accumulated a  sizeable fortune from strict saving, and always intended to bequeath that to him, but had never told him. Meanwhile, Annette announces she is pregnant. Germain had hesitated to have children, believing he could not offer them enough. Annette tells him not to worry: he can give love. When Margueritte is forced to leave her retirement home for a lesser one in Flanders, she puts aside her dictionary for Germain. He traces her down and brings her back to live with him at his mother's house. On their return, he reads her a poem written for her.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[G\u00e9rard Depardieu]] as Germain Chazes\n* [[Gis\u00e8le Casadesus]] as Margueritte\n* [[Claire Maurier]] as Jacqueline\n* [[Maurane]] as Francine\n* [[Fran\u00e7ois-Xavier Demaison (actor)|Fran\u00e7ois-Xavier Demaison]] as Gardini\n* [[Anne Le Guernec]] as Jacqueline\n* [[Amandine Chauveau]] as Jacqueline\n* [[Sophie Guillemin]] as Annette\n* [[Florian Yven]] as Germain\n* [[Patrick Bouchitey]] as Landremont\n* [[R\u00e9gis Laspal\u00e8s]] as M.
