Three years later, as Donna gets ready for her senior prom, Fenton escapes from custody, follows her to the hotel hosting the prom, and kills anybody who gets in the way of his reunion with Donna.\n\n== Plot ==\nHigh school freshman Donna Keppel returns home one evening to find her father and younger brother have been murdered. She hides under her bed where she then witnesses her mother stabbed to death by Richard Fenton, her former biology teacher who has become obsessed with Donna.\n\nThree years later, Donna lives with her Uncle Jack and Aunt Karen. She and her friends prepare for their senior prom. Meanwhile, Detective Winn, who imprisoned Fenton three years earlier, learns Fenton has escaped from prison.\n\nAt the hotel where the prom is being held, Fenton arrives disguised as a man named Howard Ramsey and reserves a room on Donna's floor. In order to gain a master key, he stabs a housekeeper to death. Donna's friend Claire has an argument with her boyfriend Michael so Donna accompanies her to their room to calm her down. After Donna leaves, Fenton enters the room and kills Claire. Michael later goes up to the room to look for her and he is also murdered by Fenton.\n\nKnowing Fenton will come for Donna, Winn arrives at the hotel with his partner Detective Nash. Donna's friend Lisa and her boyfriend Ronnie bump into Fenton on their way up to their room; Lisa recognizes him but does not know where she has seen him before. Soon after, she realizes it\u2019s the assailant and flees the room to warn Donna, only to be trapped in the stairwell by the assailant. He chases her into the basement where he finds her and slits her throat.\n\nWinn finds the body of the real Howard Ramsey in his car trunk in the parking lot. He then goes up to the room booked under Ramsey's name and finds the housekeeper's body. He sounds the emergency alarm and has the hotel evacuated. Donna quickly goes back up to her room to retrieve her mother's shawl, but runs into Fenton. After a short altercation, Donna escapes. Winn orders the SWAT team to search the hotel, but they find no sign of Fenton.\n\nDonna and her boyfriend Bobby are escorted back to Donna's house, where Winn orders back up to keep Fenton away. Inside, Donna experiences a bad dream and awakens suddenly. She then discovers Bobby is dead after having his throat slashed. She sees a shadow in the hallway and retreats to her closet to hide, only to find it is Winn coming upstairs. Before she can leave, the intruder appears in the closet and prepares to kidnap her. Donna begins to fight him and a violent struggle ensues. As Fenton is about to stab Donna, Winn returns and shoots Fenton several times in the chest, killing him.\n\nAs Donna mourns over Bobby's body and is joined by her Aunt and Uncle, Winn consoles her and tells her it is finally over.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Brittany Snow]] as Donna Keppel\n* [[Scott Porter]] as Bobby Jones\n* [[Jessica Stroup]] as Claire Davis \n* [[Dana Davis]] as Lisa Hines\n* [[Collins Pennie]] as Ronnie Heflin\n* [[Kelly Blatz]] as Michael Allen\n* [[James Ransone]] as Detective Nash\n* [[Brianne Davis]] as Crissy Lynn\n* [[Kellan Lutz]] as Rick Leland\n* [[Mary Mara]] as Mrs. Waters\n* [[Ming-Na Wen]] as Dr. Elisha Crowe\n* [[Johnathon Schaech]] as Richard Fenton\n* [[Idris Elba]] as Detective Winn\n* [[Jessalyn Gilsig]] as Aunt Karen Turner\n* [[Linden Ashby]] as Uncle Jack Turner\n* [[Jana Kramer]] as April\n* [[Rachel Specter]] as Taylor\n* Valeri Ross as Mrs. Hines\n* [[Lori Heuring]] as Mrs. Keppel\n* [[Nicholas James (actor)|Nicholas James]] (credited as Nick James) as Denny Harper\n* [[Joshua Leonard]] as Bellhop\n}}\n\n== Production ==\nThe film was originally announced in 2004 with the script being written by [[Stephen Susco]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://variety.com/2004/film/markets-festivals/moritz-shingle-asks-scribe-to-prom-1117911521/ |title=Moritz shingle asks scribe to 'Prom' |last=LaPorte |first=Nicole |date=5 October 2004 |publisher=Variety.com |access-date=9 January 2018}}</ref> The final script was written by [[J.
