Parker, and starring [[John Ritter]], [[Pam Dawber]], [[Jeffrey Jones]], and [[Eugene Levy]]. The film is about a couple being sucked into a television world by an emissary of hell, and must survive for 24 hours in order to be released from it. ''Stay Tuned'' garnered mixed reviews from critics and grossed $12 million.\n\n==Plot==\nStruggling [[Seattle]] plumbing salesman, former fencing athlete, and couch potato Roy Knable lives with his neglected wife Helen, a vitamin product senior manager. After a fight (which involved Helen smashing the family television screen with one of Roy's fencing trophies as a wake-up call to reality), Mr. Spike, a mysterious salesman, appears at the couples' door, offering them a new high-tech [[satellite dish]] system filled with [[Number of the beast|666]] channels of programs one cannot view on regular television. Unbeknownst to Roy, Spike is an emissary from [[hell]] who wants to boost the influx of souls by arranging for TV junkies to be killed in the most gruesome and ironic situations imaginable. The 'candidates' are sucked into a hellish television world, called Hellevision, and put through a gauntlet where they must survive a number of demonic satirical versions of sitcoms and movies. If they can survive for 24 hours, they are free to go, but if they get killed, then their souls will become the property of [[Satan]].\n\nThe dish eventually sucks Roy and Helen into this warped world. Spike pursues them, entering some shows along with the Knables to halt their advance. Through tenacity, improvisation, and sheer luck, the Knables stay alive, and their young son Darryl recognizes his parents fighting for their lives on the TV set. He and his older sister Diane are able to provide assistance from the real world. This infuriates Spike to the point that he makes good on Roy's contract, releasing him, but not Helen, as she was not in the system under contract.\n\nHaving no choice, Roy re-enters the system to save Helen while bringing his own remote control with him, allowing them to control their journey. After being pursued by Spike through several more channels, Roy finally confronts his enemy in a [[Salt-N-Pepa]] music video, gets hold of Spike's remote, and uses it to save Helen from being run over by a train in a Western movie. By pressing the \"off\" button on the remote, they are evicted from the dish moments before it sucks their neighbor's abusive [[Rottweiler]] into the TV and destroys itself. In the end, Spike gets eliminated by the Rottweiler on the command of Crowley, a vengeful employee he banished to the system earlier, and is then succeeded in his executive position by Pierce, a younger upstart employee. Having learned a valuable lesson after his adventure, Roy dramatically cuts back on his TV viewing, quits his job as a plumbing salesman, and opens his own fencing school, in which he advises one of his students that watching too much TV can get you into trouble.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast list|\n* [[John Ritter]] as Roy Knable\n* [[Pam Dawber]] as Helen Knable\n* [[Jeffrey Jones]] as Johnny Spike\n* [[David Tom]] as Darryl Knable\n* [[Heather McComb]] as Diane Knable\n* [[Bob Dishy]] as Murray Seidenbaum\n* [[Eugene Levy]] as Crowley\n* [[Erik King]] as Pierce\n* [[Don Calfa]] as Wetzel\n* [[Susan Blommaert]] as Ducker\n* [[One Man Gang|George Gray]] as Mr. Gorgon\n* [[Faith Minton]] as Mrs. Gorgon\n* [[Don Pardo]] as Game Show Announcer\n* [[Lou Albano]] as Ring Announcer\n* [[Salt-N-Pepa]] as Themselves\n}}\n** The group's manager and primary producer [[Hurby Azor|Hurby \"Luv Bug\" Azor]] (credited under his birth name \"Herby Azor\") and his brother Steve Azor appear as dancers during the \"Start Me Up\" segment.\n\n==Production==\nIn 1990, [[Jim Jennewein]] and Tom S.
