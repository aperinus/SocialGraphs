Reviews for the film were mixed; critics praised its visual style and consistent humor, but felt it lacked a focused or substantial plot and developed characters.<ref name=\"rotten tomatoes\" />\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1760, young [[Barnabas Collins]] and his wealthy family set sail from [[Liverpool]] to the [[New World]], where they establish the town of [[Collinsport]] in [[Maine]] and construct [[Collinwood Mansion]], their grand estate. Fifteen years later, Barnabas spurns the advances of his servant, [[Angelique Bouchard Collins|Angelique]], who is secretly a witch. In response, she murders his parents using magic and curses Barnabas so that \"all he loves will die\".\n\nBarnabas becomes obsessed with dark magic to prove his parents were murdered. Under Angelique's spell, his fianc\u00e9e [[Josette du Pres|Josette]] jumps to her death from a cliff called \"Widow's Hill\". He throws himself after her, but survives, further cursed by Angelique to eternal suffering as a [[vampire]]. Angelique turns the town against Barnabas and gets him buried alive.\n\nIn 1972, almost 200-years-later, Maggie Evans, who bears an uncanny resemblance to Josette, travels to Collinwood to fill the position of [[governess]]. She assumes the [[Pseudonym|alias]] [[Victoria Winters]] and meets the dysfunctional current-residents of Collinwood: Collins matriarch Elizabeth and her teenage daughter Carolyn; Elizabeth's brother Roger and his young son David, who believes he is being visited by his late-mother's [[ghost]]; and a live-in alcoholic psychiatrist, Dr. [[Julia Hoffman]]. That night, Victoria is visited by the ghost of Josette.\n\nA construction crew building a [[McDonald's]] unwittingly frees Barnabas from his tomb. He apologetically feeds on their blood and then makes his way to Collinwood, perplexed by the modern-day technology and fashion he encounters.\n\nAt Collinwood, Barnabas hypnotizes the caretaker, Willie, into his service and reveals to Elizabeth that the legends of the family curse and her long-lost ancestor are true. He asks to rejoin the family and shows Elizabeth the manor's secret passages and hidden treasure. Though wary, she introduces him to the family as a distant relative from England.\n\nWhile adjusting to modern life and falling for Victoria, Barnabas uses his powers of persuasion and the family treasure to restore both the Collins Canning Company and Collinwood to their former glory. Dr. Hoffman learns of his true nature and offers to try to turn him mortal again. They start by removing his blood and giving him [[Blood transfusion|transfusions]] of human blood.\n\nAngelique, having survived through the centuries and now the owner of the dominant Angel Bay Seafood, is still in love with Barnabas. To protect Victoria, he gives in to Angelique's lust and they have sex in her office, but, afterwards, a remorseful Barnabas again rejects Angelique.\n\nBarnabas hosts a \"[[happening]]\" at Collinwood for the entire town, with [[Alice Cooper]] as entertainment. He finds Victoria alone, who reveals she has seen the ghost of Josette her entire life; her parents committed her to an asylum as a result, but she eventually escaped and Josette directed her to Collinwood. She returns Barnabas' affections and they kiss, to Angelique's dismay.\n\nMore eager than ever to be human, Barnabas goes to Dr. Hoffman's office, where he discovers her transfusing his blood into herself to try to stop her aging. He drains all the blood from her body, and he and Willie dump her at sea, telling everyone she went away on business.\n\nBarnabas confronts the greedy Roger and offers him a choice: to become a better father to David, or to leave Collinwood with enough money to live out his life elsewhere; Roger chooses the latter. Heartbroken, David is nearly struck by a falling disco ball, but Barnabas saves him with supernatural speed and catches fire in the daylight, revealing himself as a vampire. David, Carolyn, and Victoria are shocked.\n\nDesperate, Barnabas meets with Angelique, who goads him into confessing to his murders and demands he join her as her paramour. He refuses, so she again traps him in a coffin. Angelique destroys the Collins\u2019 cannery and, with a recording of Barnabas' confession, rallies the town against the family.\n\nDavid frees Barnabas, who confronts Angelique at Collinwood. They battle, and the townspeople see that she is a witch. Elizabeth and Carolyn, who reveals herself to be a [[werewolf]], join the fight, and Angelique enchants the house to turn against the Collins family. She admits she was responsible for the werewolf that bit Carolyn as an infant, and for the deaths of David's mother and Barnabas' parents. The ghost of David's mother appears and incapacitates Angelique, and the family escape the burning manor. Angelique offers Barnabas her heart, which crumbles as she dies.\n\nBarnabas races to Widow's Hill and finds Victoria, who says there is only one way for them to be together. When he refuses to turn her into a vampire, she steps off the cliff. He leaps after her, biting her neck on the way down. On the rocks, he holds her in his arms. Now a vampire, she awakens as Josette. As they kiss, a voiceover from Barnabas declares that his curse is now lifted.\n\nThough Barnabas thinks he is finally safe, Dr. Hoffman, bound and on the sea floor, opens her eyes.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Johnny Depp]] as [[Barnabas Collins]], an 18th-century [[vampire]] who awakens in 1972.<ref name=\"begins\" />\n** Justin Tracy as Young Barnabas\n* [[Eva Green]] as [[Angelique Bouchard Collins|Angelique \"Angie\" Bouchard]], a vengeful witch who plots a vendetta against Barnabas and his family.
