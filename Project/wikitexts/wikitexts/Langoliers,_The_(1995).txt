It was directed and written by [[Tom Holland (filmmaker)|Tom Holland]] and based on the [[The Langoliers|novella]] by [[Stephen King]] from the four-part anthology book ''[[Four Past Midnight]]''. The series was produced by Mitchell Galin and David R. Kappes, for Laurel Entertainment, Inc. The miniseries originally aired May 14\u201315, 1995 on the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] network.\n\n==Plot==\n{{Long plot|date=September 2022}}\nDuring a [[red-eye flight]] of a [[Lockheed L-1011]] from [[LAX|Los Angeles International Airport]] to [[Boston Logan International Airport]], the plane flies through a strange light, and most of the passengers and flight crew disappear, leaving behind only personal artifacts. Only those passengers who were asleep remain, discovering the predicament when they wake. Pilot Brian Engle, [[deadheading (employee)|deadheading]] on the flight, takes the controls; unable to contact any other airport, he lands the plane at [[Bangor International Airport]] because of its long runway and lighter traffic level.\n\nIn addition to Brian, the other passengers include: Nick Hopewell, a mysterious Englishman; Laurel Stevenson, a schoolteacher on vacation;  Don Gaffney, a [[tool and die]] worker on his way to meet his new granddaughter; Albert Kaussner, a violinist on his way to the [[Berklee College of Music]]; Bethany Sims, a girl whose estranged family is planning on sending her to a [[drug rehab]];  Bob Jenkins, a mystery-novel author; Dinah Bellman, a blind girl on her way to Boston to undergo optic surgery; Rudy Warwick, a perpetually sleepy businessman with a ravenous appetite; and Craig Toomy, a mentally unstable business executive agitated over missing a meeting in Boston. Dinah, who has some [[telepathic]] ability, warns the others about Craig. When he was young Craig suffered from psychological abuse from his overbearing father, who instilled in him a fear of the \"Langoliers\", creatures that devour the lazy and irresponsible.\n\nUpon arrival at Bangor the airport is deserted and without any power. The group soon discovers that everything seems dull and lifeless; they cannot light matches, sounds don't echo, and food is tasteless. Brian fears the jet fuel will fail to move the plane, while Dinah reports hearing a strange sound in the distance. Bob postulates they passed through an [[aurora borealis]] and entered a time rip, sending them a few minutes into the past and outside of the present time stream. Craig becomes more unstable and after finding a gun in an airport locker he takes Bethany hostage and demands they take off again. Albert subdues Craig and Nick ties him up after realizing the gun's bullets are affected by the strange environment. and thus harmless; a bullet bounces off Albert without hurting him.\n\nDinah warns the others that the noises in the distance are getting louder. Albert discovers that the \"present time\" is still on the plane, and objects brought from the airport regain their normal behavior once brought onboard. The group then determines they can indeed refuel, take off heading for the time rip, and hopefully return to normal time. As Brian prepares the plane for take off, the others go to bring Craig back, but find he has escaped his bonds. When found, he stabs Dinah and Don, killing the latter. Albert again subdues Craig, and the others leave him unconscious as they race back to the plane.\n\nAs they board, the group witnesses strange creatures consuming everything including the ground. Dinah (from conversation with Craig) calls these creatures Langoliers, which Bob deduces feed on time which has passed. As a panicked Craig runs out of the airport, a weak Dinah psychically convinces him that his meeting has moved from Boston to here. In a hallucinatory state, Craig gleefully admits to his boss that he cost his company $43 million, in hopes of escaping his father's abuse. The delay leaves Craig vulnerable and he is eaten by the Langoliers. The plane takes off just as the Langoliers consume the airport. As they fly through the void, Dinah dies while recalling to Laurel what she saw through her connection with Craig: \"everything was beautiful, even the things that were dead.\"\n\nAs the plane approaches the time rip, Bob sees a snoozing Rudy and recalls they survived their first trip into the rift while asleep, and could disappear if they pass through it awake. Brian suggests reducing cabin pressure, which will knock them unconscious, but someone needs to remain awake to fly the plane and restore the pressure. Nick volunteers, having revealed that he was a government assassin on a mission, but tells Laurel to travel to London to explain this to his estranged father. Nick disappears as the plane enters the rift, and Brian wakes shortly after to land the plane in Los Angeles.\n\nThe passengers are concerned that they seem to be in a similar state as they were in Bangor, but Bob, noting the return of sound and smell, believes they may be a few minutes ahead of the Present, and that the present time stream will catch up to them. As they watch, they see other people blur into view before they rejoin the normal flow of time.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Patricia Wettig]] as Laurel Stevenson, a [[school teacher]] who uncharacteristically answered a personal ad to meet a man in Boston.\n* [[Dean Stockwell]] as Bob Jenkins, a [[mystery novel|mystery]] writer with a strong ability for deduction.
