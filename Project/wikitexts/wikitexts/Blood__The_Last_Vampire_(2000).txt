The film premiered in theaters in Japan on November 18, 2000.\n\nA single-volume [[manga]] sequel, titled ''Blood: The Last Vampire 2000'' and written by [[Benkyo Tamaoki]], was published in Japan in 2001 by [[Kadokawa Shoten]], and in English by [[Viz Media]] in November 2002 under the title ''Blood: The Last Vampire 2002''. Three Japanese [[light novel]] adaptations have also been released for the series, along with a video game. It also spawned a fifty-episode anime series set in an alternate universe titled ''[[Blood+]]'' as well as a second anime series, ''[[Blood-C]]'', also set in another alternate universe. A [[live-action]] adaptation of the film [[Blood: The Last Vampire (2009 film)|with the same title]] was released in Japan in May 2009.\n\n==Plot==\nThe story is set in 1966. Its main protagonist is a girl named Saya, who hunts [[bat]]-like [[vampiric]] creatures called Chiropterans. Saya is introduced on a subway train, where she assassinates a man in a suit. Her American contacts or handlers arrive. One of them, David, begins to brief Saya on another mission, while the other, Louis, discovers that the man Saya has just killed was probably not a Chiropteran.\n\nSaya's next mission begins at the American [[Yokota Air Base]], which is active in the buildup to the [[Vietnam War]]. At least one Chiropteran has managed to infiltrate the air base, and it is only a matter of time before they feed again, go into hibernation, and become untraceable. Saya is to pose as a school girl, infiltrate the high school adjacent to the base, and then track and kill the Chiropterans.\n\nAt the school, Saya runs into a meek nurse, Amino Makiho, on the eve of the school's annual Halloween party. Two of Saya's classmates, Sharon and Linda, make a visit to Makiho at the nurse's office. Suddenly, Saya bursts into the room, killing Linda and wounding Sharon, breaking her sword in the process. Both girls are revealed to be Chiropterans. Makiho goes into shock at the revelation. Meanwhile, a third Chiropteran reveals itself and begins making its way to the base. Back at the school, Makiho regains her nerve and pursues Sharon into a room full of dancing Americans in costume, where she finds Sharon transformed. Saya saves her and both flee into a nearby motor pool. The Chiropterans trap them inside and attack.\n\nDavid delivers a new sword, and Saya uses it to kill Sharon. The final Chiropteran then decides to flee, attempting to stow away on a departing cargo plane. David and Saya give chase and she manages to strike the Chiropteran and mortally wound it. She then stands over the dying creature and lets some of her blood trickles into its mouth. Louis arrives and recovers Makiho before the local police reach her.\n\nAfterward, Makiho is seen in an interview with government officials who question her about the night's events. However, it's revealed that all evidence of the battle between Saya and the Chiropterans has been covered up and both David and Saya have disappeared, leaving Makiho with nothing to prove the veracity of her story. Her interviewer then asks her to identify Saya in a picture which has a girl that looks identical to her, except the picture was taken in 1892. The only other description of the picture is the word \"VAMPIRE\". Makiho then returns to the school, where she narrates that she never really discovered the full truth behind Saya and the Chiropterans, and wonders if she's still out there fighting them.\n\n==Characters==\n*'''{{nihongo|{{visible anchor|Saya}}|\u5c0f\u591c|Saya}}''' hunts chiropterans using a [[katana]]. It is implied that she is the last remaining vampire and called \"the only remaining original\". Saya has no weakness to sunlight, although it is unknown if she has any of the other [[Vampire literature#Traits of vampires in fiction|vulnerabilities]] often attributed to vampires. However, she does, become distressed when she encounters religious paraphernalia and angry when people mention God in her presence. Saya displays superhuman senses and strength, as well as cunning, resourcefulness, and skill. The manga series suggests that she was a [[Dhampir|human-vampire hybrid]]. Her age is unknown, but a picture of her with nine other people is shown in the film with the date 1892 and the word \"vampire\" attached to it. Though she holds most humans in contempt, she seems to have some sort of respect for David. Voiced by [[Youki Kudoh]].<ref name=\"StaffCast\" />\n*'''David''' is a man working for the U.S. government organization called the Red Shield. He relays missions to Saya and helps her at various points in the film. Voiced by [[Joe Romersa]].<ref name=\"StaffCast\" />\n*'''{{visible anchor|Chiroptera}}''' (chiropterans or, as spoken in the film, chiropterates), from the Greek for \"hand wings\" ({{eigo|\u7ffc\u624b|yokushu}} in Japanese), are [[Hematophagy|hematophagous]] [[bat]]-like creatures, comparable to humans in intelligence. They disguise themselves as people and can gradually transform, becoming large, monstrous, and long-limbed. In this form, a further transformation produces leathery wings that allow the creature to glide, but not fly freely. Chiroptera live by feeding on human [[blood]]. They possess extraordinary speed and strength. They heal almost instantly from any non-lethal wound. Because of this, the only way to easily kill them is to cause them to lose a sufficiently large amount of blood from one attack.\n\n==Production==\nProduction I.G's president [[Mitsuhisa Ishikawa]] wanted to produce a new project that was an original concept rather than being an adaptation of an existing anime or manga series. He approached [[Mamoru Oshii]], who ran a series of lectures known as the \"Oshii Jyuku\" for teaching new filmmakers how to create their own projects, about his idea and asked him to have his students submit ideas. The submissions of [[Kenji Kamiyama]] and [[Junichi Fujisaku]] became the basis for the upcoming film: a girl in a [[sailor suit]] wielding a [[samurai sword]].<ref name=\"Animerica\" /> Ishikawa suggested [[Yokota Air Base]] for the film's setting, referring to it as the \"state of California within Japan\".<ref name=\"Animerica\" /> [[Hiroyuki Kitakubo]] was selected as the film's director, a position he accepted on the condition he be given artistic license with the material.<ref name=\"Animerica\">{{cite journal |title=Animerica Interview: Hiroyuki Kitakubo |journal=[[Animerica]] |date=December 2001 |volume=9 |issue=12 |page=37 |publisher=[[Viz Media]] |location=San Francisco, California |issn=1067-0831 |oclc=27130932 }}</ref>\n\nAfter titling the work ''Blood: The Last Vampire'', Kitakubo chose video game designer [[Katsuya Terada]] to work on the character designs, and [[Kazuchika Kise]] as the animation director.<ref name=\"Animerica\" /> When asked why he chose Terada instead of a regular character designer, Kitakubo stated \"I personally felt he had an amazing talent; his characters have a feel to them that is universal and that is probably why he has drawn characters for video games played by people all over the world.\"<ref name=\"Animerica\" /> He goes on to note that he wanted both Terada and Kise together, and would not have hired Terada had Kise not agreed to work on the project.<ref name=\"Animerica\" /> The resulting film uses completely digital animation.

He sends her to Jink\u014dsen Sh\u016britsu Valley High School under the name of \"Saya Otonashi\". There, she learns that chiropterans co-existed with humans, until humans began experimenting on them in the 19th century to try to gain immortality. The experiments increased the chiropterans' killing instinct and removed their former regard for humanity. Scientists, in turn, developed twin anti-chiropteran weapons. Maya, a prototype, still required blood and could transform like other chiropteran. The second, Saya, did not need to drink blood and had no transformation abilities so she was considered the perfected weapon. Maya searches for Saya, desiring to have Saya eat her so they can become one pure-blood chiropteran. After this meeting, Maya's body cannot be found, but it is never shown if Saya granted her request. Saya kills her handler and walks off into the night.\n\n===Light novels===\nA [[trilogy]] of [[light novels]] have been created in relation to ''Blood: the Last Vampire'' and published by [[Kadokawa Shoten|Kadokawa]].
