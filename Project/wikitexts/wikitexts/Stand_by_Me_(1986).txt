Thank you. -->\nWriter Gordie Lachance reads a newspaper article about a fatal stabbing. As a youth, his parents were too busy grieving the loss of his older brother Denny to give 12-year-old Gordie much attention. He recalls a childhood incident when he, his best friend, Chris Chambers, and two other friends, Teddy Duchamp and Vern Tessio, journeyed to find the body of a missing boy near the town of [[Castle Rock (Stephen King)|Castle Rock]], Oregon, during [[Labor Day (United States)|Labor Day]] weekend in September 1959. \n\nWhile looking for money that he buried beneath his parents' porch, Vern overhears his older brother Billy talking with his friend Charlie about finding the body of the missing boy, Ray Brower, outside of town. Billy does not want to tell police because it could draw attention to a car theft he and Charlie committed.\n\nWhen Vern tells Gordie, Chris, and Teddy what he heard, the four boys\u2014hoping to become local heroes\u2014decide to go find the body. After Chris steals his father's pistol, he and Gordie run into local hoodlums \"Ace\" Merrill and Chris's older brother, \"Eyeball.\" Ace threatens Chris with a lit cigarette and steals Gordie's Yankees cap, which was a gift from Denny.\n\nThe four boys begin their trip. After stopping at a junkyard for water, they are caught trespassing by owner Milo Pressman and his dog, Chopper. Once they escape over a fence, Milo calls Teddy's mentally ill father a \"loony\" and refers to how he almost burned Teddy's ear off. An enraged Teddy tries to attack Milo but is restrained by the other boys.\n\nThe four continue their hike, and Chris encourages Gordie to fulfill his potential as a writer despite his father's disapproval. When they cross a railroad bridge, Gordie and Vern are nearly killed by an approaching train, but jump off the tracks and escape serious injury.\n\nThat evening, as the boys camp, Gordie tells a fictional story he created about \"David 'Lard-Ass' Hogan\", an obese boy who is constantly bullied. Seeking revenge, he enters a pie-eating contest and throws up deliberately, inducing mass vomiting among everyone there.\n\nThat night, Chris informs Gordie that he hates being associated with his family's reputation. He admits stealing school milk money but says he confessed to a teacher yet was still suspended as the teacher kept quiet and pocketed the money. Devastated by the teacher's betrayal, Chris breaks down and cries.\n\nThe next day, the boys swim across a swamp, discovering it filled with leeches. Gordie faints after finding one in his underwear. After more hiking, the boys locate the body. The discovery is traumatic for Gordie, who asks Chris why Denny had to die and cries about his father hating him. Chris comforts Gordie and asserts that his father simply does not know him.\n\nAce and his gang arrive, announce that they are claiming the body, and threaten to beat the four boys if they interfere. When Chris insults Ace and refuses to back down, Ace draws a switchblade. Gordie gets the gun, fires a warning shot, and stands beside Chris with the gun pointed at Ace. Ace demands the weapon, but Gordie refuses while insulting and threatening him. Ace and his gang retreat, vowing revenge. The four boys realize it is wrong to exploit Ray Brower's death by claiming to find his body and instead report it via an anonymous phone call. They walk back to Castle Rock and part ways.\n\nBack in the present day, an adult Gordie is writing a memoir of the journey. He states that Vern and Teddy drifted away from him and Chris in junior high. Vern married after high school, had four children, and became a forklift operator. Teddy tried to get into the Army several times but failed due to his eyesight and his ear.  He later served time in jail and was currently doing odd jobs around Castle Rock. Chris chose to take college prep courses with Gordie and, despite struggling, later became a lawyer, with the two eventually drifting apart. While recently attempting to break up a fight in a restaurant, Chris was stabbed to death. Gordie writes that while he has not seen Chris in over a decade, he will miss him forever. He ends his story with \"I never had any friends later on like the ones I had when I was twelve. Jesus, does anyone?\" before going outside to play with his son.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Wil Wheaton]] as Gordon \"Gordie\" Lachance (aged 12)\n** [[Richard Dreyfuss]] as adult Gordon\n* [[River Phoenix]] as Chris Chambers\n* [[Corey Feldman]] as Teddy Duchamp\n* [[Jerry O'Connell]] as Vern Tessio\n* [[Kiefer Sutherland]] as John \"Ace\" Merrill, gang leader\n* [[Casey Siemaszko]] as Billy Tessio, gang member and Vern's older brother\n* [[John Cusack]] as Dennis \"Denny\" LaChance, Gordie's older brother\n* [[Marshall Bell]] as Mr. LaChance\n* [[Frances Lee McCain]] as Mrs. LaChance\n* [[Gary Riley]] as Charlie Hogan, gang member and Billy's best friend\n* [[Bradley Gregg]] as Richard \"Eyeball\" Chambers, gang member and Chris's older brother\n* Jason Oliver Lipsett as Vince Desjardins, gang member\n* [[Bruce Kirby (actor)|Bruce Kirby]] as Mr. Quidacioluo\n* [[William Bronder]] as Milo Pressman\n* [[Scott Beach]] as Mayor Grundy\n}}\n\n==Production==\n\n===Development===\nThe film was adapted from the Stephen King novella ''[[The Body (novella)|The Body]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.etonline.com/all-the-stephen-king-easter-eggs-in-hulus-castle-rock-from-shawshank-to-sissy-spacek-106674|title=All the Stephen King Easter Eggs in Hulu's 'Castle Rock' \u2013 From Shawshank to Sissy Spacek|website=Entertainment Tonight|access-date=April 16, 2019|archive-date=February 15, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190215160028/https://www.etonline.com/all-the-stephen-king-easter-eggs-in-hulus-castle-rock-from-shawshank-to-sissy-spacek-106674|url-status=live}}</ref> [[Bruce A.

In response, Evans and Gideon pursued an established director, [[Adrian Lyne]], to help sell the project.<ref name=CT-861121 />\n\nAfter reading the novella, Lyne teamed up with Evans and Gideon, but all the studios the trio approached turned the project down except for Martin Shafer at [[Embassy Pictures]].

He basically became Stephen King.\"<ref name=Telegraph11 /></blockquote>\n\nReiner has said that he identified with Gordie, as he himself struggled with the shadow of fame cast by his comedian father, [[Carl Reiner]].<ref name=Variety /> The writers incorporated Reiner's suggestions, producing a new script by December 1984 for Embassy's review and approval.<ref name=CT-861121 />\n\nDays before the shooting started in the summer of 1985, Embassy was sold to [[Columbia Pictures]], which made plans to cancel the production.<ref name=CT-861121 /> [[Norman Lear]], one of the co-owners of Embassy and the developer of ''All in the Family'', gave {{no wrap|$7.5 million}} of his own money to complete the film, citing his faith in Reiner and the script.<ref name=\"Variety\" /> However, since Embassy also would have distributed the film, once the film was completed it had no distributor.
