Dawn reappears in two of Solondz's other films, ''[[Palindromes (film)|Palindromes]]'' and ''[[Wiener-Dog (film)|Wiener-Dog]]''.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per [[WP:FILMPLOT]], summary should not exceed 700 words. -->\nEleven-year-old Dawn Wiener is a shy and unpopular seventh-grader living in a middle-class suburban community in [[New Jersey]]. Her older brother Mark is a nerdy high school student who plays clarinet in a garage band and shuns girls in order to prepare for college. Her younger sister Missy is spoiled and manipulative; she pesters Dawn and dances around the house in a tutu. Her mother Marj is a shrewish woman who dotes on Missy and sides with her in disputes with Dawn. Her father Harv is a meek man who sides with Marj over Dawn. Her only friend is a feminine sixth-grade boy named Ralphy, with whom she shares a dilapidated clubhouse in her backyard.\n\nAt school, Dawn is ridiculed and her locker is covered in graffiti. At home, Marj punishes her for calling Missy a \"[[Lesbian|lesbo]]\" and refusing to apologize. Her teacher unfairly keeps her after school after one of her bullies Brandon McCarthy tries to copy her answers on a test. Later, Dawn gets in trouble again after accidentally hitting another teacher in the eye with a spitball in self-defense when Brandon and his friends bully her during an assembly.\n \nMark's classmate Steve Rodgers, a handsome and charismatic aspiring rock musician, agrees to join the band in exchange for Mark's help in school. Dawn pursues him romantically when they spend time together, though one of Steve's former girlfriends tells her that she has no chance of being with him.\n\nAfter Dawn calls Brandon a \"[[Intellectual disability|retard]]\" during a confrontation, he threatens her with rape. His first attempt to assault her after school fails, but shortly afterward, he phones her, ordering her to meet him again the next day. When she complies, he takes her to a junkyard, where he starts an earnest conversation with her and kisses her instead. At dinner that evening, when she refuses to tear down her clubhouse to make room for her parents' 20th anniversary party, Marj tells Mark and Missy to destroy it anyway, and gives them Dawn's share of dessert.\n\nDawn and Brandon spend time in her clubhouse, but she confesses to him her feelings for Steve, causing him to storm out. Ralphy, who was spying on them, tries to comfort Dawn, but she angrily rejects him when he insults Brandon, leaving her with no friends.\n \nAt the anniversary party, Dawn intends to proposition Steve, but gets cold feet and is rebuffed. Steve plays with Missy, who pushes Dawn into a kiddie pool. That evening, the family watches a videotape of the party, laughing when Dawn falls into the water. Later, Dawn smashes the tape and briefly brandishes her hammer over Missy as she sleeps.\n\nA few days later, Brandon is arrested and expelled from school for suspected drug dealing. Meanwhile, Harv's car breaks down and Marj has to pick him up. She instructs Dawn to tell Missy to get a ride home with her ballet teacher, but she chooses not to after arguing with Missy, who is kidnapped as a result.\n\nDawn visits Brandon's home and meets his mentally challenged brother and aggressive father. She tells Brandon that she wants to be his girlfriend, but he tells her that he is running away to [[New York City]] to avoid being sent to a [[reformatory]]. After they kiss, an argument about him dealing drugs ensues, with him saying that one of his friends is the real culprit. Regardless, he asks Dawn if she will come with him, but she declines and he leaves through his bedroom window.\n\nWhen Marj is informed that Missy's tutu was found in [[Times Square]], Dawn goes to New York City to look for her. After a night of searching, she phones home and Mark tells her that Missy was found alive and unharmed by police after being abducted by a [[Pedophilia|pedophilic]] neighbor. Dawn returns to town and her classmates ridicule her as she delivers a thank-you speech. Mark later tells her that she cannot expect school life to get any better until high school. On a bus ride to [[Walt Disney World]] for a concert tour, Dawn sits among her fellow choir members and unenthusiastically joins them in singing the school anthem.\n<!-- Per [[WP:FILMPLOT]], summary should not exceed 700 words. -->\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Heather Matarazzo]] as Dawn Wiener\n* [[Matthew Faber]] as Mark Wiener\n* Daria Kalinina as Missy Wiener\n* Angela Pietropinto as Marj Wiener\n* Bill Buell as Harv Wiener\n* [[Brendan Sexton III]] as Brandon McCarthy\n* [[Eric Mabius]] as Steve\n* Dimitri DeFresco as Ralphy\n* Victoria Davis as Lolita\n* Christina Brucato as Cookie\n* [[Christina Vidal]] as Cynthia\n* Amouris Rainey as Darla\n* Siri Howard as Chrissy\n* Telly Pontidis as Jed\n* Herbie Duarte as Lance\n* Jared Solano as Neko\n* Scott Coogan as Troy\n* Colleen Kelley Whitcombe as News Reporter\n* Josiah Trager as Kenny\n* [[Ken Leung]] as Barry\n}}\n\n==Reception==\nThe film was a surprise success, considering it was a relatively low budget, independently produced film.
