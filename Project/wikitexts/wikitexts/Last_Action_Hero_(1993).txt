Schwarzenegger also served as the film's executive producer and plays himself as the actor portraying Jack Slater.\n\n''Last Action Hero'' failed to meet the studio's expectations at the box office, and was both a critical and commercial disappointment.

Following his father's death, Danny takes comfort in watching action movies, especially a series featuring the indestructible Los Angeles cop, Jack Slater, at his local movie theater owned by Nick, who also acts as the projectionist. Nick gives Danny a golden ticket once owned by [[Harry Houdini]], to see an early screening of ''Jack Slater IV'' before its official release.\n\nDuring the film, the ticket stub magically transports Danny into the fictional world, interrupting Slater in the middle of a car chase. After escaping from their pursuers, Slater takes Danny to the LAPD headquarters, where Danny points out evidence of the fictional nature of Slater's world, such as the presence of numerous beautiful women and a cartoon cat detective named Whiskers, and says that Slater's friend John Practice should not be trusted as he \"killed [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]]\" (since he is played by the same actor as [[Antonio Salieri]] in ''[[Amadeus (film)|Amadeus]]''). Though Slater accepts all of this as part of Danny's wild imagination, Slater's supervisor, Lieutenant Dekker, assigns Danny as his new partner, and instructs them to investigate criminal activities related to mafia boss Tony Vivaldi.\n\nDanny guides Slater to Vivaldi's mansion, recognizing its location from the start of the movie. There, they meet Vivaldi's henchman, Mr. Benedict. Danny later claims that Vivaldi and Benedict were the ones who killed Slater's second cousin, but Slater has no evidence, and they are forced to leave; however, Benedict is curious as to how Danny knew, and he and several hired guns follow Slater and Danny back to Slater's home. There, Slater, his daughter Whitney, and Danny thwart the attack, though Benedict ends up getting the ticket stub. He discovers its ability to transport him out of the film and into the real world.\n\nSlater deduces Vivaldi's plan to murder the rival mob by releasing a lethal gas during a funeral atop a skyscraper. He and Danny go to stop it, but are waylaid by Practice, who reveals that Danny was right: he is working for Vivaldi. Whiskers kills Practice, saving Slater and Danny, and the two manage to prevent any deaths from the gas release. Learning that Vivaldi's plan has failed, Benedict kills him, and he uses the stub to escape into the real world, pursued by Slater and Danny.\n\nSlater becomes despondent upon learning the truth, as well as his mortality in the real world, but cheers up after spending some time with Irene. Meanwhile, Benedict devises a plan to kill the actor portraying Slater in the movie, [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]], after which he can bring other villains from other movies into the real world and take over. To help, Benedict brings the Ripper, the villain of ''Jack Slater III'', to the premiere of ''Jack Slater IV'' to assassinate Schwarzenegger. Danny and Slater learn of this and race there. Slater saves Schwarzenegger and kills the Ripper. Benedict appears and shoots Slater, critically injuring him. Danny subdues and disarms Benedict, allowing Slater to grab his revolver and shoot Benedict in his explosive [[glass eye]], killing him; however, the blast causes the stub to be lost. With Slater losing blood, Danny knows that the only way to save him is to return him to the fictional world, where he is indestructible.\n\nThe ticket stub falls in front of a theater playing the film ''[[The Seventh Seal]],'' where ''The Figure of Death'' from the film leaves. Death appears before Danny and Slater after they arrive at the theater in a hurry. Danny holds Death at gunpoint, but Death clarifies he was simply curious: Jack Slater is missing from his lists of when people will die, and Danny is slated to die as a grandfather. Death then suggests searching for the other half of the ticket. Danny finds it and is able to take Slater back into his movie, where his wounds instantly heal. Danny returns to the real world before the portal closes. A recovered Slater then enthusiastically embraces the true nature of his reality when he talks to Dekker about his new plan, appreciating the differences between the two worlds. Danny and Nick share a heartfelt moment reminiscing their past, while Slater drives away on the screen, waving goodbye.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] as Detective Jack Slater / Himself / [[Hamlet]], an LAPD officer who serves as the film's protagonist.\n* [[Austin O'Brien]] as Danny Madigan, a ten-year-old boy who is a big fan of the Slater franchise and the film's overarching protagonist.<ref>{{cite news|title= Limelight, Cameras, 'Action' for O.C.

Sony then destroyed the test cards and the word-of-mouth proved to be catastrophic for the film.\n* The shooting and editing schedule were so demanding and so close to the June 18 release date that after the movie's release, a source close to the film said that they \"shouldn't have had [[At the Movies with Ebert & Roeper|Siskel and Ebert]] telling us the movie is 10 minutes too long\".\n* Sony was even more humiliated the weekend after the film opened, when the movie lost 47% of its opening-weekend audience and had [[TriStar Pictures|TriStar]]'s ''[[Sleepless in Seattle]]'' open as the number-two movie at the box office.\n* The final declared financial loss for the film was $26 million.\n* ''Last Action Hero'' was the first film to be released using [[Sony Dynamic Digital Sound]], but only a few theaters were set up for the new format, and many of those experienced technical problems with the new system.

He told the authors of ''Hit And Run'' that while everyone involved with the production had given their best effort, their attempt to appeal to both action and comedy fans resulted in a film that appealed to neither audience and ultimately succumbed to heavy competition.<ref>{{cite news|title= Theaters Report 'Hero' Is Running on Short Legs|work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=June 30, 1993|url= https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1993-06-30-ca-8551-story.html |access-date=April 1, 2022 |first=David J.|last=Fox}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title= SUMMER SNEAKS : The Seasonal Sweats : 'Jurassic Park' and 'Last Action Hero' are going to take the summer, no problem.
