It stars [[Jeff Bridges]] as Jeffrey \"The Dude\" Lebowski, a [[Los Angeles]] [[slacker]] and avid [[Ten-pin bowling|bowler]]. He is assaulted as a result of mistaken identity, then learns that a millionaire also named Jeffrey Lebowski ([[David Huddleston]]) was the intended victim. The millionaire Lebowski's [[trophy wife]] is kidnapped, and millionaire Lebowski commissions The Dude to deliver the [[ransom]] to secure her release; the plan goes awry when the Dude's friend Walter Sobchak ([[John Goodman]]) conspires to keep the ransom money. [[Sam Elliott]], [[Julianne Moore]], [[Steve Buscemi]], [[John Turturro]], [[Philip Seymour Hoffman]], [[Tara Reid]], [[David Thewlis]], [[Peter Stormare]], [[Jon Polito]], and [[Ben Gazzara]] also appear, in supporting roles.\n\nThe film is loosely inspired by the work of [[Raymond Chandler]]. Joel Coen stated, \"We wanted to do a Chandler kind of story \u2013 how it moves episodically, and deals with the characters trying to unravel a mystery, as well as having a hopelessly complex plot that's ultimately unimportant.\"<ref name=\"The Big Sleep\" /> The [[film score|original score]] was composed by [[Carter Burwell]], a longtime collaborator of the Coen brothers.\n\n''The Big Lebowski'' received mixed reviews at the time of its release. Over time, reviews have become largely positive, and the film has become a [[cult film|cult favorite]],<ref name=\"avclub\" /> noted for its eccentric characters, comedic dream sequences, idiosyncratic dialogue, and eclectic soundtrack.<ref name=\"russell\" /> In 2014, the film was selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\". A spin-off, titled ''[[The Jesus Rolls]]'', was released in 2020, with Turturro reprising his role and also serving as writer and director.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/news/big-lebowski-ferris-buellers-day-off-added-to-national-film-registry-20141217 |title='Big Lebowski,' 'Ferris Bueller' Added to National Film Registry \u2013 Rolling Stone |work=Rolling Stone |access-date=July 19, 2015 |date=December 17, 2014 |archive-date=June 29, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180629122316/https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/news/big-lebowski-ferris-buellers-day-off-added-to-national-film-registry-20141217 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title = New Films Added to National Registry {{!}} News Releases \u2013 Library of Congress|url = https://www.loc.gov/today/pr/2014/14-210.html|website = Library of Congress|access-date = October 1, 2015|date = December 17, 2014|archive-date = December 25, 2020|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20201225022702/https://www.loc.gov/item/prn-14-210/|url-status = live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Complete National Film Registry Listing |url=https://www.loc.gov/programs/national-film-preservation-board/film-registry/complete-national-film-registry-listing/|website=Library of Congress|access-date=May 19, 2020|archive-date=March 5, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305191832/https://www.loc.gov/programs/national-film-preservation-board/film-registry/complete-national-film-registry-listing/|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n== Plot ==\nIn early 1990s [[LA County, California|Los Angeles]], Jeffrey \"The Dude\" Lebowski is attacked in his home by two enforcers for [[Pornography|porn]] kingpin Jackie Treehorn, to whom a different Jeffrey Lebowski's wife owes money. One of the thugs urinates on the Dude's rug before the two realize that they have the wrong man and leave.\n\nConsulting his bowling partners, [[Vietnam veteran]] Walter Sobchak and [[fall guy]] Donny Kerabatsos, the Dude visits wealthy philanthropist Jeffrey Lebowski (\"the big Lebowski\"), requesting compensation for the rug. Lebowski refuses, but the Dude tricks his assistant Brandt into letting him take a similar rug from the mansion. Outside, he meets Bunny, Lebowski's [[trophy wife]], and her German [[Nihilism|nihilist]] friend Uli.  Soon afterwards, Bunny is apparently kidnapped, and Lebowski hires The Dude to deliver the requested [[ransom]] money, one million dollars. That night, another group of thugs ambush the Dude, taking his replacement rug on behalf of Lebowski's daughter Maude, who has a sentimental attachment to it.\n\nThe kidnappers arrange to collect the ransom. Convinced that the kidnap was a ruse by Bunny, Walter schemes to keep the money, substituting it with a bag of his dirty laundry. The plan fails, the kidnappers leave with Walter's bag, and he and The Dude return to the bowling alley, leaving the briefcase of money in the car trunk. While they bowl, the car is stolen. The Dude is soon confronted by Lebowski, who hands him an envelope from the kidnappers containing a severed toe, supposedly Bunny's. Maude asks the Dude to help recover the money, which her father illegally withdrew from the family's foundation.\n\nThe Dude is abducted and taken to Jackie Treehorn's house. Treehorn demands to know where Bunny is and what happened to his money. The Dude tells Treehorn that Bunny faked her kidnapping and that his money is with Larry Sellers. The Dude passes out after his White Russian was spiked, and has an intense dream in which he envisions an elaborate, [[Busby Berkeley]]-style musical sequence featuring himself and Maude. When he comes to, he is arrested and taken to a local police station, where the police chief threatens him and warns him to stay out of Malibu. On the ride home, the Dude is thrown out of his taxi after complaining about the driver's selection of [[The Eagles]] on the car radio. Soon after, Bunny drives by in her car, with all her toes shown to be intact.\n\nReturning home, The Dude finds Maude, who has sex with him. She explains that she is trying to become pregnant with a father whom she will not have to interact with socially. She reveals that her father has no money of his own; his wealth came from her late mother.\n\nThe Dude and Walter confront Lebowski, and find that Bunny has returned, having simply gone out of town without telling anyone. He explains that Bunny's nihilist friends had taken the opportunity to try and blackmail Lebowski, who, in turn, had tried to embezzle money from the family charity, blaming its disappearance on the blackmailers. The briefcase given to the Dude never contained any money. An enraged Walter insists that Lebowski is faking his paralysis and lifts him out of his wheelchair, but discovers that the paralysis is real.\n\nIn a final confrontation outside of the bowling alley, the nihilists set fire the Dude's car, and demand the ransom money. Walter fights them off, but during the altercation, Donny dies from a [[Myocardial infarction|heart attack]]. Walter scatters Donny's ashes from a cliff overlooking the [[Pacific Ocean]], but they are blown back over himself and the Dude by an updraft. The two go bowling.\n\nAt the alley, the Dude encounters the Stranger, the film's narrator, who sums up everything that happened in the movie, noting that while he \"didn't like seeing Donny go\", he remains optimistic and reveals that Maude is pregnant with a \"little Lebowski on the way\".\n\n== Cast ==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Jeff Bridges]] as Jeffrey \"The Dude\" Lebowski\n* [[John Goodman]] as

Liberation Front|Seattle Seven]], liked to drink [[White Russian (cocktail)|White Russians]], and was known as \"The Dude\".<ref name=\"Green, Bill\" />{{rp|91\u201392}} The Dude was also partly based on a friend of the Coen brothers, Peter Exline (now a member of the faculty at [[University of Southern California|USC]]'s School of Cinematic Arts), a Vietnam War veteran who reportedly lived in a dump of an apartment and was proud of a little rug that \"tied the room together\".<ref name=\"Bergan, Ronald\" />{{rp|188}} Exline knew [[Barry Sonnenfeld]] from [[New York University]] and Sonnenfeld introduced Exline to the Coen brothers while they were trying to raise money for ''Blood Simple''.<ref name=\"Green, Bill\" />{{rp|97\u201398}} Exline became friends with the Coens and in 1989, told them all kinds of stories from his own life, including ones about his actor-writer friend Lewis Abernathy (one of the inspirations for Walter), a fellow Vietnam vet who later became a private investigator and helped him track down and confront a high school kid who stole his car.<ref name=\"Green, Bill\" />{{rp|99}} As in the film, Exline's car was impounded by the Los Angeles Police Department and Abernathy found an 8th grader's homework under the passenger seat.<ref name=\"Green, Bill\" />{{rp|100}}\n\nExline also belonged to an amateur softball league but the Coens changed it to bowling in the film, because \"it's a very social sport where you can sit around and drink and smoke while engaging in inane conversation\".<ref name=\"Bergan, Ronald\" />{{rp|195}} The Coens met filmmaker [[John Milius]] when they were in Los Angeles making ''[[Barton Fink]]'' and incorporated his love of guns and the military into the character of Walter.<ref name=\"Bergan,

Scott]], [[Jerry Falwell]], [[Gore Vidal]], [[Andy Griffith]], [[William F. Buckley]], and [[Ernest Borgnine]]. The Coens' top choice was [[Marlon Brando]], but he was unable to star in the film due to health issues.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/61708/21-things-you-might-not-know-about-big-lebowski |title=23 Huge Facts About The Big Lebowski |access-date=May 12, 2021 |archive-date=May 12, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210512094900/https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/61708/21-things-you-might-not-know-about-big-lebowski |url-status=live }}</ref> [[Charlize Theron]] was considered for the role of Bunny Lebowski.<ref>{{cite web| url = https://www.shortlist.com/news/50-things-you-probably-didnt-know-about-the-big-lebowski| title = The Big Lebowski: 50 facts you (probably) didn't know \u2013 Shortlist}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Julianne Moore, the character of Maude was based on artist [[Carolee Schneemann]], \"who worked naked from a swing\", and on [[Yoko Ono]].<ref name=\"Ciment, Michel\" />{{rp|156}} The character of Jesus Quintana, an opponent of The Dude's bowling team, was inspired in part by a performance the Coens had seen John Turturro give in 1988 at the Public Theater in a play called ''Mi Puta Vida'' in which he played a [[pederast]]-type character, \"so we thought, let's make Turturro a pederast. It'll be something he can really run with,\" Joel said in an interview.<ref name=\"Bergan, Ronald\" />{{rp|195}}\n\nThe film's overall structure was influenced by the detective fiction of [[Raymond Chandler]]. Ethan said, \"We wanted something that would generate a certain narrative feeling \u2013 like a modern Raymond Chandler story, and that's why it had to be set in Los Angeles ... We wanted to have a narrative flow, a story that moves like a Chandler book through different parts of town and different social classes.\"<ref name=\"Levine, Josh\" /> The use of the Stranger's voice-over also came from Chandler as Joel remarked, \"He is a little bit of an audience substitute. In the movie adaptation of Chandler it's the main character that speaks off-screen, but we didn't want to reproduce that though it obviously has echoes. It's as if someone was commenting on the plot from an all-seeing point of view. And at the same time rediscovering the old earthiness of a [[Mark Twain]].\"<ref name=\"Ciment, Michel\" />{{rp|169}}\n\nThe significance of the bowling culture was, according to Joel, \"important in reflecting that period at the end of the fifties and the beginning of the sixties. That suited the retro side of the movie, slightly anachronistic, which sent us back to a not-so-far-away era, but one that was well and truly gone nevertheless.\"<ref name=\"Ciment, Michel\" />{{rp|170}}\n\n=== Screenplay ===\nThe Coen Brothers wrote ''The Big Lebowski'' around the same time as ''[[Barton Fink]]''. When the Coen brothers wanted to make it, John Goodman was filming episodes for ''[[Roseanne (TV series)|Roseanne]]'' and Jeff Bridges was making the [[Walter Hill (filmmaker)|Walter Hill]] film ''[[Wild Bill (1995 film)|Wild Bill]]''. The Coens decided to make ''[[Fargo (1996 film)|Fargo]]'' in the meantime.<ref name=\"Bergan, Ronald\" />{{rp|189}} According to Ethan, \"the movie was conceived as pivoting around that relationship between the Dude and Walter\", which sprang from the scenes between Barton Fink and Charlie Meadows in ''Barton Fink''.<ref name=\"Ciment, Michel\" />{{rp|169}} They also came up with the idea of setting the film in contemporary L.A., because the people who inspired the story lived in the area.<ref name=\"Robertson, William\" />{{rp|41}} When Pete Exline told them about the homework in a baggie incident, the Coens thought that that was very Raymond Chandler and decided to integrate elements of the author's fiction into their script. Joel Coen cites [[Robert Altman]]'s ''[[The Long Goodbye (film)|The Long Goodbye]]'' as a primary influence on their film, in the sense that ''The Big Lebowski'' \"is just kind of informed by Chandler around the edges\".<ref name=\"Robertson, William\" />{{rp|43}} When they started writing the script, the Coens wrote only 40 pages and then let it sit for a while before finishing it. This is a normal writing process for them, because they often \"encounter a problem at a certain stage, we pass to another project, then we come back to the first script. That way we've already accumulated pieces for several future movies.\"<ref name=\"Ciment, Michel\" />{{rp|171}} In order to liven up a scene that they thought was too heavy on [[exposition (narrative)|exposition]], they added an \"effete art-world hanger-on\", known as Knox Harrington, late in the screenwriting process.<ref name=\"McCarthy, Phillip\" /> In the original script, the Dude's car was a [[Chrysler LeBaron]], as Dowd had once owned, but that car was not big enough to fit John Goodman so the Coens changed it to a [[Ford Torino]].<ref name=\"Green, Bill\" />{{rp|93}}\n\n=== Pre-production ===\n[[PolyGram Filmed Entertainment|PolyGram]] and [[Working Title Films]], which had funded ''Fargo'', backed ''The Big Lebowski'' with a budget of $15&nbsp;million. In casting the film, Joel remarked, \"we tend to write both for people we know and have worked with, and some parts without knowing who's going to play the role. In ''The Big Lebowski'' we did write for John [Goodman] and Steve [Buscemi], but we didn't know who was getting the Jeff Bridges role.\"<ref name=\"Woods, Paul\" /> [[Mel Gibson]] was originally considered for the role of The Dude, but he didn't take the pitch too seriously.<ref name=\"Greene, Andy\">{{cite web |date=September 4, 2008 |last=Greene |first=Andy |title='The Big Lebowski': The Decade of the Dude |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/movie-news/the-big-lebowski-the-decade-of-the-dude-231432/ |website=[[Rolling Stone]] }}</ref> In preparation for his role, Bridges met Dowd but actually \"drew on myself a lot from back in the Sixties and Seventies. I lived in a little place like that and did drugs, although I think I was a little more creative than the Dude.\"<ref name=\"Bergan, Ronald\" />{{rp|188}} The actor went into his own closet with the film's wardrobe person and picked out clothes that he had thought the Dude might wear.<ref name=\"Green, Bill\" />{{rp|27}} He wore his character's clothes home because most of them were his own.<ref name=\"Carr, Jay\" /> The actor also adopted the same physicality as Dowd, including the slouching and his ample belly.<ref name=\"Green, Bill\" />{{rp|93}} Originally, Goodman wanted a different kind of beard for Walter but the Coen brothers insisted on the \"Gladiator\" or what they called the \"Chin Strap\" and he thought it would go well with his [[flattop]] haircut.<ref name=\"Green, Bill\" />{{rp|32}}\n\nFor the film's look, the Coens wanted to avoid the usual retro 1960s clich\u00e9s like [[lava lamps]], [[blacklight poster|Day-Glo posters]], and [[Grateful Dead]] music<ref name=\"Robertson, William\" />{{rp|95}} and for it to be \"consistent with the whole bowling thing, we wanted to keep the movie pretty bright and poppy\", Joel said in an interview.<ref name=\"Bergan, Ronald\" />{{rp|191}} For example, the star motif, featured predominantly throughout the film, started with the film's production designer Richard Heinrichs' design for the bowling alley. According to Joel, he \"came up with the idea of just laying free-form neon stars on top of it and doing a similar free-form star thing on the interior\". This carried over to the film's dream sequences. \"Both dream sequences involve star patterns and are about lines radiating to a point. In the first dream sequence, the Dude gets knocked out and you see stars and they all coalesce into the overhead nightscape of L.A. The second dream sequence is an astral environment with a backdrop of stars\", remembers Heinrichs.<ref name=\"Bergan, Ronald\" />{{rp|191}} For Jackie Treehorn's Malibu beach house, he was inspired by late 1950s and early 1960s bachelor pad furniture. The Coen brothers told Heinrichs that they wanted Treehorn's beach party to be [[Inca]]-themed, with a \"very Hollywood-looking party in which young, oiled-down, fairly aggressive men walk around with appetizers and drinks. So there's a very sacrificial quality to it.\"<ref name=\"Robertson, William\" />{{rp|91}}\n\nCinematographer [[Roger Deakins]] discussed the look of the film with the Coens during pre-production. They told him that they wanted some parts of the film to have a real and contemporary feeling and other parts, like the dream sequences, to have a very stylized look.<ref name=\"Robertson, William\" />{{rp|77}} Bill and Jacqui Landrum did all of the choreography for the film. For his dance sequence, Jack Kehler went through three three-hour rehearsals.<ref name=\"Green, Bill\" />{{rp|27}} The Coen brothers offered him three to four choices of classical music for him to pick from and he chose [[Modest Mussorgsky]]'s ''[[Pictures at an Exhibition]]''. At each rehearsal, he went through each phase of the piece.<ref name=\"Green, Bill\" />{{rp|64}}\n\n=== Principal photography ===\nActual filming took place over an eleven-week period with location shooting in and around Los Angeles, including all of the bowling sequences at the [[Hollywood Star Lanes]] (for three weeks)<ref name=\"Wloszcyna, Susan\" /> and the Dude's [[Busby Berkeley]] dream sequences in a converted airplane hangar.<ref name=\"Levine, Josh\" /> According to Joel, the only time they ever directed Bridges \"was when he would come over at the beginning of each scene and ask, 'Do you think the Dude burned one on the way over?' I'd reply 'Yes' usually, so Jeff would go over in the corner and start rubbing his eyes to get them bloodshot.\"<ref name=\"Bergan, Ronald\" />{{rp|195}} Julianne Moore was sent the script while working on ''[[The Lost World: Jurassic Park]]''. She worked only two weeks on the film, early and late during the production that went from January to April 1997<ref name=\"Arnold, Gary\" /> while Sam Elliott was only on set for two days and did many takes of his final speech.<ref name=\"Green, Bill\" />{{rp|46}}\n\nThe scenes in Jackie Treehorn's house were shot in the [[Sheats-Goldstein Residence]], designed by [[John Lautner]] and built in 1963 in the Hollywood Hills.<ref name=\"AutoTR-1\" />\n\nDeakins described the look of the fantasy scenes as being very crisp, monochromatic, and highly lit in order to afford greater depth of focus. However, with the Dude's apartment, Deakins said, \"it's kind of seedy and the light's pretty nasty\" with a grittier look. The visual bridge between these two different looks was how he photographed the night scenes. Instead of adopting the usual blue moonlight or blue street lamp look, he used an orange sodium-light effect.<ref name=\"Robertson, William\" />{{rp|79}} The Coen brothers shot much of the film with wide-angle lens because, according to Joel, it made it easier to hold focus for a greater depth and it made camera movements more dynamic.<ref name=\"Robertson, William\" />{{rp|82}}\n\nTo achieve the point-of-view of a rolling bowling ball the Coen brothers mounted a camera \"on something like a barbecue spit\", according to Ethan, and then dollied it along the lane.

While the Coens were writing the screenplay they had [[Kenny Rogers]]' \"Just Dropped In (to See What Condition My Condition Was in)\", the [[Gipsy Kings]]' cover of \"[[Hotel California]]\", and several [[Creedence Clearwater Revival]] songs in mind.<ref name=\"Greene\" /> They asked [[T-Bone Burnett]] (who would later work with the Coens on ''[[O Brother, Where Art Thou?]]'' and ''[[Inside Llewyn Davis]]'') to pick songs for the soundtrack of the film. They knew that they wanted different genres of music from different times but, as Joel remembers, \"T-Bone even came up with some far-out Henry Mancini and Yma Sumac.\"<ref name=\"Altman\" /> Burnett was able to secure songs by Kenny Rogers and the Gipsy Kings and also added tracks by [[Captain Beefheart]], [[Moondog]] and [[Bob Dylan]]'s \"[[The Man in Me]]\".<ref name=\"Greene\" /> However, he had a tough time securing the rights to Townes Van Zandt's cover of [[the Rolling Stones]]' \"Dead Flowers\", which plays over the film's closing credits. Former Stones manager [[Allen Klein]] owned the rights to the song and wanted $150,000 for it. Burnett convinced Klein to watch an early cut of the film and remembers, \"It got to the part where the Dude says, 'I hate the fuckin' [[Eagles (band)|Eagles]], man!' Klein stands up and says, 'That's it, you can have the song!' That was beautiful.\"<ref name=\"Greene\" /><ref name=\"flowers\" /> Burnett was going to be credited on the film as \"Music Supervisor\", but asked his credit to be \"Music Archivist\" because he \"hated the notion of being a supervisor; I wouldn't want anyone to think of me as management\".<ref name=\"Altman\" />\n\nFor Joel, \"the original music, as with other elements of the movie, had to echo the retro sounds of the Sixties and early Seventies\".<ref name=\"Ciment, Michel\" />{{rp|156}} Music defines each character. For example, \"[[Tumbling Tumbleweeds]]\" by Bob Nolan was chosen for the Stranger at the time the Coens wrote the screenplay, as was \"Lujon\" by [[Henry Mancini]] for Jackie Treehorn. \"The German nihilists are accompanied by techno-pop and Jeff Bridges by Creedence. So there's a musical signature for each of them\", remarked Ethan in an interview.<ref name=\"Ciment, Michel\" />{{rp|156}}\nThe character Uli Kunkel was in the German electronic band Autobahn, an homage to the band [[Kraftwerk]]. The album cover of their record ''Nagelbett'' (''bed of nails'') is a parody of the Kraftwerk album cover for ''[[The Man-Machine]]'' and the group name Autobahn shares the name of a Kraftwerk [[Autobahn (song)|song]] and [[Autobahn (album)|album]]. In the lyrics the phrase \"We believe in nothing\" is repeated with electronic distortion. This is a reference to Autobahn's nihilism in the film.<ref name=\"burwell\" />\n{{track listing\n| extra_column = Performer\n| title1 = [[The Man in Me]]\n| writer1 = [[Bob Dylan]]\n| extra1 = Dylan\n| title2 = [[Clear Spot|Her Eyes Are a Blue Million Miles]]\n| writer2 = [[Captain Beefheart]]\n| extra2 = Beefheart\n| title3 = My Mood Swings\n| writer3 = [[Elvis Costello]] and [[Cait O'Riordan]]\n| extra3 = Costello\n| title4 = [[Voice of the Xtabay|Ataypura]]\n| writer4 = Moises Vivanco\n| extra4 = [[Yma Sumac]]\n| title5 = Traffic Boom\n| writer5 = [[Piero Piccioni]]\n| extra5 = Piccioni\n| title6 = I Got It Bad & That Ain't Good\n| writer6 = [[Duke Ellington]] and [[Paul Francis Webster]]\n| extra6 = [[Nina Simone]]\n| title7 = Stamping Ground\n| note7 = The track actually includes two songs, starting with \"Theme\", which then leads to \"Stamping Ground\"\n| writer7 = [[Moondog]]\n| extra7 = Moondog\n| title8 = [[Just Dropped In (To See What Condition My Condition Was In)]]\n| writer8 = [[Mickey Newbury]]\n| extra8 = [[Kenny Rogers]] & [[The First Edition (band)|The First Edition]]\n| title9 = Walking Song\n| writer9 = [[Meredith Monk]]\n| extra9 = Monk\n| title10 = [[Gl\u00fcck das mir verblieb]]\n| note10 = from ''[[Die tote Stadt]]&thinsp;''\n| writer10 = [[Erich Wolfgang Korngold]]\n| extra10 = Ilona Steingruber, [[Anton Dermota]] and the Austrian State Radio Orchestra\n| title11 = [[Lujon]]\n| writer11 = [[Henry Mancini]]\n| extra11 = Mancini\n| title12 = [[Hotel California]]\n| writer12 = [[Don Henley]], [[Glenn Frey]] and [[Don Felder]]\n| extra12 = The [[Gipsy Kings]]\n| title13 = Technopop\n| note13 = Wie Glauben\n| writer13 = [[Carter Burwell]]\n| extra13 = Burwell\n| title14 = [[Dead Flowers (Rolling Stones song)|Dead Flowers]]\n| writer14 = [[Mick Jagger]] and [[Keith Richards]]\n| extra14 = [[Townes Van Zandt]]\n| length9 = 2:55\n| length14 = 4:47\n| length13 = 3:21\n| length12 = 5:47\n| length11 = 2:38\n| length10 = 5:08\n| length3 = 2:10\n| length8 = 3:21\n| length7 = 5:11\n| length6 = 4:07\n| length5 = 3:15\n| length4 = 3:03\n| length2 = 2:54\n| length1 = 3:08\n| total_length = 51:45\n}}\n{{track listing\n| headline= Other music used (not on soundtrack album)\n| extra_column= Performer\n| title1= [[Tumbling Tumbleweeds]]\n| writer1= [[Bob Nolan]]\n| extra1= [[Sons of the Pioneers]]\n| title2= Mucha Muchacha\n| writer2= [[Juan Garc\u00eda Esquivel]]\n| extra2= Esquivel\n| title3= I Hate You\n| writer3= Gary Burger, David Havlicek, Roger Johnston, Thomas E.
