The film examines the events leading up to the [[assassination of John F. Kennedy]] in 1963 and its alleged cover-up, through the eyes of former New Orleans district attorney [[Jim Garrison]]. Garrison [[Trial of Clay Shaw|filed charges against Clay Shaw]] for his alleged participation in a [[John F. Kennedy assassination conspiracy theories|conspiracy to assassinate Kennedy]], for which [[Lee Harvey Oswald]] was found responsible by the [[Warren Commission]].\n\nThe film's screenplay was adapted by Stone and Zachary Sklar from the books ''[[On the Trail of the Assassins]]'' (1988) by Jim Garrison and ''Crossfire: The Plot That Killed Kennedy'' (1989) by [[Jim Marrs]]. Stone described this account as a \"counter-myth\" to the Warren Commission's \"fictional myth.\"\n\n''JFK'' became embroiled in controversy at the time of its release. Many major American newspapers ran editorials accusing Stone of taking liberties with historical facts, including the film's implication that Kennedy's vice president (and eventual successor) [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] was part of a ''[[coup d'\u00e9tat]]'' to kill Kennedy. Despite the controversy surrounding its historical depiction, ''JFK'' received critical praise for the performances of its cast, Stone's directing, score, editing, and cinematography. The film gradually picked up momentum at the box office after a slow start, earning over $205&nbsp;million in worldwide gross, making it the sixth highest-grossing film of 1991 worldwide.\n\n''JFK'' was nominated for eight [[Academy Awards]], including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], and won two for [[Academy Award for Best Cinematography|Best Cinematography]] and [[Academy Award for Best Film Editing|Best Editing]]. It was the first of three films Stone made about American presidents, followed by ''[[Nixon (film)|Nixon]]'' and ''[[W. (film)|W.]]''.\n\n== Plot ==\nDuring his [[Eisenhower's farewell address|farewell address]] in 1961, outgoing President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] warns about the build-up of the \"[[military-industrial complex]]\". He is succeeded by [[John F. Kennedy]] as president, whose time in office is marked by the [[Bay of Pigs Invasion]] and the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] until [[Assassination of John F. Kennedy|his assassination]] in [[Dealey Plaza]] on November 22, 1963. Kennedy's suspected assassin [[Lee Harvey Oswald]] is arrested for the murder of police officer [[J. D. Tippit]] but is killed by [[Jack Ruby]]. [[New Orleans]] [[District Attorney]] [[Jim Garrison]] and his team investigate potential New Orleans links to the JFK assassination, including private pilot [[David Ferrie]], but their investigation is publicly rebuked by the federal government and Garrison closes the investigation.\n\nThe investigation is reopened in 1966 after Garrison reads the [[Warren Report]] and notices what he believes to be multiple inaccuracies. Garrison and his staff interrogate people involved with Oswald and Ferrie. One such witness is Willie O'Keefe, a male prostitute serving five years in prison for [[soliciting]], who says he witnessed Ferrie discussing about assassinating the President, as well as briefly meeting Oswald, and romantically involved with a man called \"[[Clay Bertrand]]\". Garrison and his team theorize Oswald was an agent of the Intelligence Agency and was framed for the assassination.\n\nIn 1967, Garrison and his team talk to several witnesses to the Kennedy assassination, including [[Jean Hill]], a teacher who says she witnessed a gunman shooting from the grassy knoll, that [[United States Secret Service|Secret Service]] threatened her into saying three shots came from the book depository, and her testimony was altered by the [[Warren Commission]]. Garrison's staff also test fire an empty rifle from the Texas School Book Depository from which Oswald was alleged to have shot Kennedy and conclude that Oswald was too poor a marksman to make the shots, indicating more than one shooter were involved. Garrison comes to believe New Orleans-based international businessman [[Clay Shaw]] is the same man as Bertrand. When Shaw is interrogated, the businessman denies any knowledge of meeting Ferrie, O'Keefe or Oswald. Some key witnesses become scared and refuse to testify while others, such as Ruby and Ferrie, are killed in suspicious circumstances. Before his death, Ferrie tells Garrison that he believes people are after him, and reveals there was a conspiracy to kill Kennedy. Garrison meets a high-level figure in Washington D.C. who identifies himself as \"X\". He suggests a ''coup d'\u00e9tat'' at the highest levels of government, implicating members of the [[CIA]], the [[American Mafia|Mafia]], the military-industrial complex, [[United States Secret Service|Secret Service]], [[FBI]], and Kennedy's vice-president and then president [[Lyndon Baines Johnson]] as either co-conspirators or as having motives to cover up the truth of the assassination. X suggests that Kennedy was killed because he wanted to pull the United States out of the [[Vietnam War]] and dismantle the CIA. X encourages Garrison to keep digging and prosecute Shaw. Shaw is soon charged with conspiring to murder the President.\n\nSome of Garrison's staff begin to doubt his motives and disagree with his methods, and leave the investigation. Garrison's marriage is strained when his wife Liz complains that he is spending more time on the case than with his own family. After a sinister phone call is made to their daughter, Liz accuses Garrison of being selfish and attacking Shaw only because of his homosexuality. In addition, the media launches attacks on television and in newspapers attacking Garrison's character and criticizing the way his office is spending taxpayers' money. Garrison suspects a connection with the [[assassination of Martin Luther King Jr.]] and the [[assassination of Robert F. Kennedy]].\n\nThe [[trial of Clay Shaw]] takes place in 1969. Garrison presents the court with a dismissal of the [[single-bullet theory]], proposing a scenario involving three assassins firing six shots and framing Oswald for the murders of Kennedy and Tippit, but the jury acquits Shaw after less than one hour of deliberation. Members of that jury state publicly that they believe there was a conspiracy behind the assassination, but not enough evidence to link Shaw to that conspiracy.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{div col|colwidth=26em}}\n* [[Kevin Costner]] as [[Jim Garrison]]\n* [[Kevin Bacon]] as Willie O'Keefe\n* [[Tommy Lee Jones]] as [[Clay Shaw]] / [[Clay Bertrand]]\n* [[Laurie Metcalf]] as Susie Cox\n* [[Gary Oldman]] as [[Lee Harvey Oswald]]\n* [[Michael Rooker]] as Bill Broussard\n* [[Jay O.

He changed it from a scholarly book in the third person to \"a detective story \u2013 a whydunnit\" in the first person.<ref name= \"Crowdus, Gary\">{{cite news | last = Crowdus | first = Gary | title = Getting the Facts Straight: An Interview with Zachary Sklar | work = Cineaste | date = May 1992 }}</ref> Sklar edited the book and it was published in 1988. While attending the Latin American Film Festival in [[Havana]], [[Cuba]], Stone met Sheridan Square Press publisher Ellen Ray on an elevator. She had published Jim Garrison's book ''On the Trail of the Assassins''.<ref name=\"Riordan, James4\">Riordan 1996, p. 351.</ref> Ray had gone to New Orleans and worked with Garrison in 1967. She gave Stone a copy of Garrison's book and told him to read it.<ref name=\"Riordan, James5\">Riordan 1996, p. 352.</ref> He did and quickly bought the film rights with $250,000 of his own money to prevent talk going around the studios about projects he might be developing.<ref name= \"Salewicz, Chris2\">Salewicz 1998, p. 80.</ref>\n\nKennedy's assassination had always had a profound effect on Stone: \"The Kennedy murder was one of the signal events of the postwar generation, my generation.\"<ref name=\"Riordan, James5\"/> Stone met Garrison and grilled him with a variety of questions for three hours. Garrison stood up to Stone's questioning and then got up and left. His pride and dignity impressed the director.<ref name=\"Riordan, James6\">Riordan 1996, p. 353.</ref> Stone's impressions from their meeting were that \"Garrison made many mistakes. He trusted a lot of weirdos and followed a lot of fake leads. But he went out on a limb, way out. And he kept going, even when he knew he was facing long odds.\"<ref name=\"Riordan, James7\">Riordan 1996, p. 354.</ref>\n\nStone was not interested in making a film about Garrison's life, but rather the story behind the conspiracy to kill Kennedy. He also bought the film rights to [[Jim Marrs]]' book ''Crossfire: The Plot That Killed Kennedy''. One of the filmmaker's primary goals with ''JFK'' was to provide a rebuttal to the Warren Commission's report that he believed was \"a great myth. And in order to fight a myth, maybe you have to create another one, a counter-myth.\"<ref name=\"Riordan, James8\">Riordan 1996, p. 355.</ref> Even though Marrs' book collected many theories, Stone was hungry for more and hired Jane Rusconi, a recent [[Yale University]] graduate, to lead a team of researchers and assemble as much information about the assassination as possible while the director completed post-production on ''[[Born on the Fourth of July (film)|Born on the Fourth of July]]''. Stone read two dozen books on the assassination while Rusconi read between 100 and 200 books on the subject.<ref name= \"Crowdus, Gary2\">{{cite news | last = Crowdus | first = Gary | title = Clarifying the Conspiracy: An Interview with Oliver Stone | work = Cineaste | date = May 1992}}</ref>\n\nBy December 1989, Stone began approaching studios to back his film. While in pre-production on ''[[The Doors (film)|The Doors]]'', he met with three executives at [[Warner Bros.]] who wanted him to make a film about [[Howard Hughes]].<ref name=\"Riordan, James9\">Riordan 1996, p. 356.</ref> However, [[Warren Beatty]] owned the rights and so Stone pitched ''JFK''. Studio president and chief operating officer [[Terry Semel]] liked the idea. He had a reputation for making political and controversial films, including ''[[All the President's Men (film)|All the President's Men]]'', ''[[The Parallax View]]'' and ''[[The Killing Fields (film)|The Killing Fields]]''.<ref name=\"Riordan, James10\">Riordan 1996, p. 357.</ref> Stone made a handshake deal with Warner Bros. whereby the studio would get all the rights to the film and put up $20&nbsp;million for the budget. The director did this so that the screenplay would not be widely read and bid on, and he also knew that the material was potentially dangerous and wanted only one studio to finance it. Finally, Stone liked Semel's track record of producing political films.<ref name=\"Riordan, James10\"/>\n\n=== Screenplay ===\nWhen Stone set out to write the screenplay, he asked Sklar (who also edited Marrs' book) to co-write it with him and distill the Garrison and Marrs books and Rusconi's research into a script that would resemble what he called \"a great detective movie.\"<ref name=\"Riordan, James11\">Riordan 1996, p. 358.</ref> Stone told Sklar his vision of the film:\n{{blockquote|I see the models as ''[[Z (1969 film)|Z]]'' and ''[[Rashomon (film)|Rashomon]]'', I see the event in Dealey Plaza taking place in the first reel, and again in the eighth reel, and again later, and each time we're going to see it differently and with more illumination.<ref name=\"Crowdus, Gary\"/>}} Although he did employ ideas from ''Rashomon'', his principal model for ''JFK'' was ''Z'':\n{{blockquote|Somehow I had the impression that in ''Z'' you had the showing of the crime and then the re-showing of the crime throughout the picture until it was seen another way. That was the idea of ''JFK'' \u2013 that was the essence of it: basically, that's why I called it ''JFK''. Not J dot F dot K dot. JFK. It was a code, like ''Z'' was a code, for he lives, American-style. As it was written it became more fascinating: it evolved into four [[DNA]] threads.<ref name= \"Salewicz, Chris4\">Salewicz 1998, p. 81.</ref>}} Stone broke the film's structure down into four stories: Garrison investigating the New Orleans connection to the assassination; the research that revealed what Stone calls, \"Oswald legend: who he was and how to try to inculcate that\"; the recreation of the assassination at Dealey Plaza; and the information that the character of \"X\" imparts on Garrison, which Stone saw as the \"means by which we were able to move between New Orleans, local, into the wider story of Dealey Plaza.\"<ref name= \"Salewicz, Chris5\">Salewicz 1998, pp. 82\u201383.</ref>\n\nSklar worked on the Garrison side of the story while Stone added the Oswald story, the events at Dealey Plaza and the \"Mr. X\" character.<ref name=\"Riordan, James11\"/> Sklar spent a year researching and writing a 550-page triple-spaced screenplay and then Stone rewrote it and condensed it closer to normal screenplay length. Stone and Sklar used composite characters, most notably the \"Mr. X\" character played by Donald Sutherland. This was a technique that would be criticized in the press.<ref name=\"Riordan, James12\">Riordan 1996, p. 359.</ref> He was a mix of [[Richard Case Nagell]] and retired [[United States Air Force|Air Force]] colonel [[L. Fletcher Prouty|Fletcher Prouty]], another adviser for the film and who was a military liaison between the CIA and [[the Pentagon]]. Meeting Prouty was, for Stone, \"one of the most extraordinary afternoons I've ever spent. Pretty much like in the movie, he just started to talk.\"<ref name= \"Salewicz, Chris3\">Salewicz 1998, pp. 80\u201381.</ref> According to Stone, {{blockquote|I feel this was in the spirit of the truth because Garrison also met a [[Deep Throat (Watergate)|deep throat]] type named Richard Case Nagell, who claimed to be a CIA agent and made Jim aware of a much larger scenario than the microcosm of New Orleans.<ref name=\"Riordan, James13\">Riordan 1996, p. 360.</ref>}}\n\nThe screenplay's early drafts suggested a four and a half-hour film with a potential budget of [[United States dollar|$]]40&nbsp;million \u2013 double what Stone had agreed to with Warner Bros.<ref name=\"Riordan, James14\">Riordan 1996, p. 361.</ref> The director knew film mogul [[Arnon Milchan]] and met with him to help finance the film. Milchan was eager to work on the project and launch his new company, [[Regency Enterprises]], with a high profile film like ''JFK''.<ref name=\"Riordan, James15\">Riordan 1996, p. 365.</ref> Milchan made a deal with Warner Bros. to put up the money for the film. Stone managed to pare down his initial revision, a 190-page draft, to a 156-page shooting script.<ref name=\"Riordan, James16\">Riordan 1996, p. 374.</ref>\n\nThere were many advisers for the film, including [[Gerry Patrick Hemming|Gerald Hemming]], a former [[United States Marine Corps|Marine]] who claimed involvement in various CIA activities, and [[Robert Groden]], a self-proclaimed photographic expert and longtime JFK assassination researcher and author.<ref name= \"Stone, Oliver\">Stone 2000, p. 590.</ref>\n\nStone later published ''JFK: The Documented Screenplay'', a heavily annotated version of the screenplay in which he cites sources for nearly every claim made in the film ({{ISBN|1557831270}}).\n\n=== Casting ===\nTrying to cast the role of Garrison, Stone sent copies of the script to Costner, [[Mel Gibson]], and [[Harrison Ford]]. Initially, Costner turned Stone down. However, the actor's agent, [[Michael Ovitz]], was a big fan of the project and helped Stone convince the actor to take the role.<ref name= \"Riordan, James\">Riordan 1996, p. 363.</ref> Before accepting the role, Costner conducted extensive research on Garrison, including meeting the man and his enemies. Two months after finally signing on to play Garrison in January 1991, his film ''[[Dances with Wolves]]'' won seven Academy Awards and so his presence greatly enhanced ''JFK''{{'}}s bankability in the studio's eyes.<ref name=\"Riordan, James2\">Riordan 1996, p. 368.</ref>\n\nTommy Lee Jones was originally considered for another role that was ultimately cut from the film and Stone then decided to cast him as Shaw.<ref name=\"Riordan, James23\">Riordan 1996, p. 370.</ref> In preparation for the film, Jones interviewed Garrison on three different occasions and talked to others who had worked with Shaw and knew him.<ref name=\"Smith2\">{{cite news | last=Smith | first=Gavin | title=Somebody's gonna give you money, you do your best to make 'em a good hand | work=[[Film Comment]] | pages=33 | date=January\u2013February 1994}}</ref>\n\nStone originally wanted [[James Woods]] to play David Ferrie, but Woods wanted to play Garrison. Stone also approached [[Willem Dafoe]] and [[John Malkovich]], who both turned down the role.<ref name=\"Riordan, James3\"/>\n\nStone considered [[Marlon Brando]] for the role of Mr. X.<ref>[https://truthout.org/articles/the-oliver-stone-interview-part-ii-jfk/ The Oliver Stone Interview, Part II|Truthout]</ref>\n\nAccording to Gary Oldman, very little was written about Oswald in the script. Stone gave him several plane tickets, a list of contacts, and told him to do his own research.<ref name= \"Lawrence\">{{cite news | last=Lawrence | first=Will | title=In Conversation with Gary Oldman | work=[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]] | page=130 |date=August 2007}}</ref> Oldman met with Oswald's wife, [[Marina Oswald Porter|Marina]], and her two daughters to prepare for the role.<ref name= \"Salewicz, Chris\">Salewicz 1998, p. 83.</ref> Beata Po\u017aniak studied 26 volumes of the [[Warren Commission|Warren Report]] and spent time living with Marina Oswald. Since the script contained few lines for the Oswalds, Po\u017aniak interviewed acquaintances of the Oswalds in order to improvise her scenes with Gary Oldman.\n\nMany actors were willing to waive their normal fees because of the nature of the project and to lend their support.<ref name=\"Riordan, James3\">Riordan 1996, p. 369.</ref> [[Martin Sheen]] provided the opening narration. Jim Garrison played Chief Justice [[Earl Warren]], during the scene in which he questions Jack Ruby in a Dallas jail and in a TV appearance. Assassination witness [[Beverly Oliver]], who claims to be the \"[[Babushka Lady]]\" seen in the [[Zapruder film]], also appeared in a cameo in Ruby's club. [[Sean Stone]], Oliver Stone's son, plays Garrison's oldest son Jasper. [[Perry Russo]], one of the sources for the fictional character Willie O'Keefe, appeared in a cameo as an angry bar patron who says Oswald should get a medal for shooting Kennedy.\n\n=== Principal photography ===\nThe story revolves around Costner's Jim Garrison, with a large cast of well-known actors in supporting roles. Stone was inspired by the casting model of the documentary epic ''[[The Longest Day (film)|The Longest Day]]'', which he had admired as a child: \"It was realistic, but it had a lot of stars ... the supporting cast provides a map of the American psyche: familiar, comfortable faces that walk you through a winding path in the dark woods.\"<ref name=\"Riordan, James2\"/>\n\nCinematographer [[Robert Richardson (cinematographer)|Robert Richardson]] was a week and a half into shooting ''[[City of Hope (film)|City of Hope]]'' for [[John Sayles]] when he got word that Stone was thinking about making ''JFK''. By the time principal photography wrapped on ''City of Hope'', Richardson was ready to make Stone's film. To prepare, Richardson read up on various JFK assassination books starting with ''On the Trail of the Assassins'' and ''Crossfire: The Plot That Killed Kennedy''.<ref name= \"Fisher, Bob\">{{cite news | last = Fisher | first = Bob | title = The Whys and Hows of ''JFK''| work = [[American Cinematographer]] | date = February 1992 }}</ref>\n\nThe original idea was to film the opening sequence in 1.33:1 [[Aspect ratio (image)|aspect ratio]] in order to simulate the TV screens that were available at the time of the assassination, then transition to 1.85:1 when Garrison began his investigation, and finally switch to 2.35:1 for scenes occurring in 1968 and later. However, because of time constraints and logistics, Richardson was forced to abandon this approach.<ref name=\"Fisher, Bob\"/>\n\nStone wanted to recreate the Kennedy assassination in Dealey Plaza. His producers had to pay the Dallas City Council a substantial amount of money to hire police to reroute traffic and close streets for three weeks.<ref name=\"Riordan, James17\">Riordan 1996, p. 371.</ref> He only had ten days to shoot all of the footage he needed and so he used seven cameras (two 35&nbsp;mm and five 16&nbsp;mm) and 14 film stocks.<ref name=\"Fisher, Bob\"/> Getting permission to shoot in the [[Texas School Book Depository]] was more difficult. They had to pay $50,000 to put someone in the window from which Oswald was supposed to have shot Kennedy.<ref name=\"Riordan, James17\"/> They were allowed to film in that location only between certain hours with only five people on the floor at one time: the camera crew, an actor and Stone. Co-producer [[Clayton Townsend]] has said that the hardest part was getting the permission to restore the building to the way it looked back in 1963. It took five months of negotiation.<ref name=\"Riordan, James17\"/>\n\nThe production spent $4 million to restore Dealey Plaza to 1963 conditions.<ref name=\"Riordan, James18\">Riordan 1996, p. 375.</ref> Stone utilized a variety of film stocks. Richardson said, \"It depends whether you want to shoot in [[35mm movie film|35]] or [[16 mm film|16]] or [[Super 8 mm film|Super 8]]. In many cases the lighting has to be different.\"<ref name=\"Riordan, James19\">Riordan 1996, p. 377.</ref> For certain shots in the film, Stone employed multiple camera crews shooting at once, using five cameras at the same time in different formats. Richardson said of Stone's style of direction, \"Oliver disdains convention, he tries to force you into things that are not classic. There's this constant need to stretch.\"<ref name=\"Fisher, Bob\"/> This forced the cinematographer to use lighting in diverse positions and rely very little on classic lighting modes. Shooting began on April 15, 1991 and ended on July 31, lasting 78 days with filming finished four-and-a-half months before the release date.<ref name= \"Salewicz, Chris6\">Salewicz 1998, p. 84.</ref>\n\n=== Editing ===\n''JFK'' marked a fundamental change in the way that Stone constructed his films: a subjective lateral presentation of the plot, with the editing's rhythm carrying the story.<ref name= \"Salewicz, Chris7\">Salewicz 1998, p. 85.</ref> Stone brought in [[Hank Corwin]], an editor of commercials, to help edit the film. Stone chose him because his \"chaotic mind\" was \"totally alien to the film form.\"<ref name=\"Salewicz, Chris7\"/> \"But he had not developed the long form yet. And so a lot of his cuts were very chaotic.\"<ref name=\"Salewicz, Chris7\"/> Stone employed extensive use of flashbacks within flashbacks for a specific effect. He said in an interview, {{blockquote|I wanted to do the film on two or three levels \u2013 sound and picture would take us back, and we'd go from one flashback to another, and then that flashback would go inside another flashback&nbsp;... I wanted multiple layers because reading the Warren Commission Report is like drowning.<ref name=\"Crowdus, Gary2\"/>}} Because of being shot on various sized film stocks, conventional 35mm film editing was impossible.  Although digital editing was in nascent form, [[LightWorks]] and [[Avid Technology|AVID]] were still not available as editing systems when editing began on ''JFK''.  For that reason, all the footage was transferred to 3/4\" videotape and edited on videotape. The 35mm film negative, along with the other sized film stocks were then conformed to match the videotape edit.\n\nYears after its release, Stone said of the film that it \"was the beginning of a new era for me in terms of film making because it's not just about a conspiracy to kill John Kennedy. It's also about the way we look at our recent history ... It shifts from black and white to color, and then back again, and views people from offbeat angles.\"<ref name= \"carnes\">{{cite news | last = Carnes | first = Mark C | title = Past Imperfect: History According to the Movies | work = [[Cineaste (magazine)|Cineaste]] | date =Fall 1996 | volume = 22 | issue = 4 | url = http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/pastimperfect.html | access-date = September 9, 2008 | archive-date = October 16, 2017 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20171016145737/http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/pastimperfect.html | url-status = live }}</ref>\n\n=== Music ===\n{{Main|JFK (soundtrack)}}\nBecause of his enormous commitment to [[Steven Spielberg]]'s ''[[Hook (film)|Hook]]'', which opened the same month as ''JFK'', composer [[John Williams]] did not have time to compose a conventional score for the entire film. Instead he composed and conducted six musical sequences in full for ''JFK'' before he saw the film in its entirety.<ref name= \"Dyer\">{{cite news | last = Dyer | first = Richard | title = ''Hook'', ''JFK'' are latest hits with the John Williams touch | work = [[Boston Globe]] | pages = A5 | date = January 19, 1992 }}</ref> Soon after recording this music, he traveled to New Orleans where Stone was still shooting the film and saw approximately an hour's worth of edited footage and dailies.
