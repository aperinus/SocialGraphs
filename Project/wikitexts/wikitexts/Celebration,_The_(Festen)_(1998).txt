Gathered together amongst a large party of family and friends are his wife Else ([[Birthe Neumann]]), his sullen eldest son Christian ([[Ulrich Thomsen]]), his boorish younger son Michael ([[Thomas Bo Larsen]]), and his well-traveled daughter Helene ([[Paprika Steen]]). Another sibling, Linda, has recently taken her life at the hotel. Helene finds Linda's [[suicide note]], but hides it in a medicine bottle after becoming upset by the undisclosed contents. Michael fights with his wife, whom he had earlier abandoned on the roadside with their three children, and then has sex with her. He later beats Michelle, a waitress of the hotel, after she pulls him aside to discuss that he had impregnated her in an affair.\n\nAt Helge's birthday dinner, Christian makes a toast to his father. During the toast, he publicly accuses Helge of [[child sexual abuse|sexually abusing]] both him and his twin sister Linda as children. After an initial shocked silence, the party goes on as usual as guests decide to move past the moment in denial. Helge pulls Christian aside to engage in a baffled conversation about his accusations. He questions his motivations for [[slander]]ing him, and Christian appears to recant his accusation. However, Christian is spurred to further action by hotel chef Kim (Bjarne Henriksen), a childhood friend who knows about the abuse. Christian then continues his toast by accusing Helge of causing Linda's death through the trauma caused from the abuse. Helge speaks to Christian alone and makes threatening offers to bring up his troubled personal history, including his [[impotence]] with women and Christian's perhaps-[[incest]]uous relationship with Linda.\n\nFurther exacerbating the tensions of the day, Helene's black boyfriend Gbatokai (Gbatokai Dakinah) shows up, causing the racist Michael to lead most of the partygoers in singing the racist Danish song \"''[[Jeg har set en rigtig negermand]]''\" to offend him. Else later makes a toast where she makes insulting comments towards her children, and accuses Christian of having an overactive imagination. With this, she asks him to apologize for his earlier statements and accusations. Christian then accuses Else of knowing about the abuse yet not intervening. Michael and two other guests eject Christian from the hotel. When Christian walks back in, they beat him and tie him to a tree in the woods outside of the hotel. Christian unties himself and returns. Pia finds Linda's suicide note and gives it to Christian.\n\nChristian gives the note to Helene and she reads it aloud in front of the party guests. In the note, Linda states that she is overwhelmed by trauma from Helge's abuse. Helge admits to his misdeeds and leaves the dining room. Christian has a hallucination of Linda, causing him to faint. As he awakes, he learns from Helene that Michael is missing. Michael, also drunk, calls Helge outside and beats him severely. The following morning, the family and guests eat breakfast when Helge comes in and speaks to the group. He admits to his wrongdoing and declares his love for his children. Michael tells his father to leave the table.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n*[[Ulrich Thomsen]] as Christian Klingenfeldt-Hansen\n*[[Henning Moritzen]] as Helge, the father\n*[[Thomas Bo Larsen]] as Michael, the brother\n*[[Paprika Steen]] as Helene, the sister\n*[[Birthe Neumann]] as Else, the mother\n*[[Trine Dyrholm]] as Pia\n*{{ill|Helle Dolleris|af||da}} as Mette\n*{{ill|Therese Glahn|af||da}} as Michelle\n*[[Klaus Bondam]] as Helmut von Sachs, the toastmaster\n*[[Bjarne Henriksen]] as Kim\n*Gbatokai Dakinah as Gbatokai\n*{{ill|Lasse Lunderskov|af||da||de}} as The uncle\n*[[Lars Brygmann]] as Lars, the receptionist\n*{{ill|Lene Laub Oksen|da}} as Linda, the dead sister\n*{{ill|Linda Laursen|af||da}} as Birthe\n*John Boas as Grandfather\n*Erna Boas as Grandmother\n}}\n\n==Style==\n[[File:Dogme28.jpg|thumb|[[Dogme 95]] certificate of authenticity. ]]\n''Festen'' is best known for being the first [[Dogme 95]] film (its full title in Denmark is '''''Dogme #1 \u2013 Festen'''''). Dogme films are governed by a manifesto that insists on specific production and narrative limitations (such as banning any post-production sound editing), in part as a protest against the expensive Hollywood-style film-making.

We see that the son has been severely damaged by his boyhood abuse, and has been incapable of intimate relatedness throughout his life. His sister, who has committed suicide, was also deeply damaged.
