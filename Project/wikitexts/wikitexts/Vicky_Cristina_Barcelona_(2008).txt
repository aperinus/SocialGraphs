The film stars [[Javier Bardem]], [[Pen\u00e9lope Cruz]], [[Rebecca Hall]] and [[Scarlett Johansson]] in lead roles. The plot centers on two American women, Vicky and Cristina, who spend a summer in [[Barcelona]], where they meet an artist, Juan Antonio, who is attracted to both of them, while still enamored of his mentally and emotionally unstable ex-wife Mar\u00eda Elena. The film was shot in Spain in Barcelona, [[Avil\u00e9s]], and [[Oviedo]], and was Allen's fourth consecutive film shot outside the United States.\n\n''Vicky Cristina Barcelona'' premiered at the [[2008 Cannes Film Festival]], and then received a rolling worldwide general release that started on August 15, 2008, in the United States, and continued in various countries until its June 2009 release in Japan. The film emerged as a commercial success at the box office, becoming one of Allen's highest-grossing films. It received widespread critical acclaim upon release, with particular praise directed towards Cruz's performance.\n\nAt the [[66th Golden Globe Awards]], ''Vicky Cristina Barcelona'' received 4 nominations, including [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor \u2013 Motion Picture Musical or Comedy|Best Actor \u2013 Musical or Comedy]] (Bardem), [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress \u2013 Motion Picture Comedy or Musical|Best Actress \u2013 Musical or Comedy]] (Hall) and [[Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress \u2013 Motion Picture|Best Supporting Actress]] (Cruz), and won [[Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture \u2013 Musical or Comedy|Best Film \u2013 Musical or Comedy]]. Cruz also won both the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Academy Award]] and [[BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role|BAFTA Award]] for Best Supporting Actress, in addition to a [[Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Supporting Role|Screen Actors Guild Award]] nomination in the same category.\n\n==Plot==\nVicky and Cristina visit [[Barcelona]] for the summer, staying with Vicky's distant relative Judy and her husband Mark. While the two are great friends, Vicky is practical and traditional in her approach to love and commitment and is engaged to the reliable Doug, whereas Cristina imagines herself to be a nonconformist, spontaneous but unsure of what she wants from life or love.\n\nAt an art exhibition, Cristina is intrigued by artist Juan Antonio, who Judy says has suffered a violent relationship with his ex-wife. Later, he brazenly approaches Vicky and Cristina to invite them to join him right away for the weekend in the city of [[Oviedo]], in a small plane he flies himself, for sight-seeing, fine eating and drinking, and hopefully, lovemaking. Cristina is won over by the offer almost at once, but Vicky is unimpressed and reluctant; she, however, eventually decides to accompany her friend anyway, mainly to watch over her.\n\nAt the end of their first day, Vicky refuses to join Juan Antonio in his hotel room, citing her fidelity to Doug, but Cristina accepts his invitation immediately. Before the lovemaking starts, Cristina suddenly falls ill with digestive complaints, and is put to bed, with food poisoning. Vicky and Juan Antonio proceed to spend the weekend together alone while they wait for Cristina to recuperate. Vicky gradually changes her opinion of Juan Antonio as he tells her about his tumultuous relationship with his former wife, Mar\u00eda Elena. Vicky accompanies him to visit his father, an old poet, and then becomes deeply moved by a Spanish guitar performance later that evening. She finally succumbs to Juan Antonio's advances as they walk through a grove of trees in the dark. The next day, with Cristina recovered, the three of them fly back to Barcelona.\n\nFeeling guilty, Vicky does not mention the incident to Cristina, and the two begin to grow apart. Vicky starts throwing herself into her studies while Cristina and Juan Antonio take up a relationship. Cristina then moves in with Juan Antonio and begins to discover more about his past. After learning that Mar\u00eda Elena attempted to kill herself, Juan Antonio takes her to his home, where Cristina already lives. After some defiance, the two women grow fond of each other. Cristina realizes that the ex-spouses are still in love, and Mar\u00eda Elena suggests that Cristina may be the element that can give balance and stability to their relationship. All three become romantically involved with one another.\n\nIn the meantime, Vicky is joined in Spain by an enthusiastic Doug and the two get married. When Cristina describes her new life with Juan Antonio to Vicky, Vicky becomes secretly jealous, and after a few other awkward moments, she realizes she is unsatisfied in her married life and is still attracted to Juan Antonio. Learning that Judy is similarly unhappy in her marriage, she confides to her, and Judy, who sees her younger self in Vicky, decides to bring Juan Antonio and Vicky together. Meanwhile, Cristina becomes restless and at some point decides to leave Juan Antonio and Mar\u00eda Elena; without her, their relationship quickly falls apart again.\n\nAs the summer winds to a close, Judy arranges for Juan Antonio and Vicky to meet at a party. Juan Antonio begs Vicky to meet him again privately before leaving Spain, which she finally accepts, lying to Doug in the process. At his home, Juan Antonio seduces and wins Vicky over again, but they are interrupted by Mar\u00eda Elena who bursts in with a gun, firing wildly as Juan Antonio tries to calm her. Vicky gets shot in the hand in the process, and leaves, shouting they are insane and she could never live like this. She confesses the entire story to Cristina, who never realized how Vicky felt about Juan Antonio, and wishes she could have helped her. Doug, Vicky and Cristina return to the United States; Doug never learns what truly happened, Vicky goes back to her married life, and Cristina is back where she started, still unsure of what she wants from life or love.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Javier Bardem]] as Juan Antonio Gonzalo\n* [[Pen\u00e9lope Cruz]] as Mar\u00eda Elena\n* [[Rebecca Hall]] as Vicky\n* [[Scarlett Johansson]] as Cristina\n* [[Patricia Clarkson]] as Judy Nash\n* [[Kevin Dunn]] as Mark Nash\n* [[Chris Messina]] as Doug\n* [[Pablo Schreiber]] as Ben\n* [[Carrie Preston]] as Sally\n* [[Zak Orth]] as Adam\n* [[Julio Perill\u00e1n]] as Charles\n* [[Christopher Evan Welch]] as narrator\n}}\nSpanish actor Joan Pera, who dubbed Allen's voice in the Spanish-language versions of his previous films, makes a [[cameo appearance]].<ref>(2007-04-12).
