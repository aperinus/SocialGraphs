Mccollough), volunteer to fight with General [[Andrew Jackson]] and Major Tobias Norton in the [[Creek War]] (1813-1814). They return home after a successful battle, to make sure their families have enough provisions for the winter, rejoining a short time later to find the Americans at a stalemate against the [[Muscogee people|Creeks]], with Jackson having [[Battle of New Orleans|gone to New Orleans]]. Against Norton's orders, Crockett and Russell scout for Creek positions, and Russell is captured.\n\nCrockett tracks the Creeks to their camp, where he challenges the remaining Creek chief, Red Stick, to a [[Tomahawk (axe)|tomahawk]] duel for Russell's life. Crockett wins, but agrees to spare Red Stick's life in exchange for his signing [[Treaty of Fort Jackson|the American peace treaty]].\n\n===Off to Congress===\nCrockett and Russell head west to scout virgin territory being opened for settlement, planning to send for Davy's family once a cabin has been built. They acquire a claim after beating Bigfoot Mason in a shooting contest. They learn that Mason is running Native Americans off their land in order to resell it, and befriend a family of Cherokee  refugees Mason has victimized. Crockett offers to become the magistrate for the area. Crockett defeats Mason in hand-to-hand combat before arresting him and his surviving accomplice (the other one having been shot dead when he tried to shoot Crockett).\n\nCrockett is convinced to run for the state legislature against Amos Thorpe, a corrupt politician in league with men trying to claim [[Cherokee]] lands, who is running unopposed. He then receives a letter from his sister-in-law telling him that his wife has died of a fever. Crockett wins the election handily and becomes a popular member of the Tennessee General Assembly. He reunites with Norton and Andrew Jackson, who is running for [[President of the United States]] and convinces him to run for the [[United States House of Representatives]].\n\nAfter he enters Congress, Norton, trying to pass a bill to usurp Native American treaty lands, has Crockett embark on a speaking tour across the eastern United States to distract him, but Russell learns of the bill and brings Crockett back to Washington to argue against it. Crockett tears the bill in half before leaving, ending his political career.\n\n===The Alamo===\nCrockett decides to join the [[Battle of the Alamo]] (1836), joined by George Russell. While traveling to [[San Antonio]], they are joined by Thimblerig, a riverboat gambler, and Busted Luck, a [[Comanche]] tribesman. Reaching the Alamo, they join its defense, though Colonel [[James Bowie]] confides that their supplies are dangerously low. Russell manages to slip through the enemy lines to try to bring back help, only to return empty-handed. The Texan garrison withstands several attacks from Mexican troops before being overcome. George Russell, Thimblerig, Busted Luck, Travis, and a bedridden Colonel Bowie are all killed, leaving Crockett the sole defender standing. Crockett is last seen swinging his rifle against the encroaching Mexicans; the scene then fades to a shot of the [[Flag of Texas|Lone Star Flag]] and Crockett's journal closing on its last entry \"March 6, 1836 - Liberty and Independence Forever!\", accompanied by a reprise of \"[[The Ballad of Davy Crockett]]\".\n\n==Production==\nMost footage was shot in [[Tennessee]] and [[Wildwood Regional Park]] in [[Thousand Oaks, California]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.timeout.com/los-angeles/things-to-do/hiking-trails-in-la-the-best-hikes-with-waterfalls|title=5 Best Waterfall Hikes in Los Angeles for a Refreshing Trek}}</ref><ref>Schneider, Jerry L.
