[[Mary Kay Place]], [[Meadow Sisto]], and [[Benjamin Salisbury]] also star as his wife and children.\n\n==Plot==\nMartin Harvey is a middle-aged office worker who lives in  [[Chicago]] with his wife, Katherine, 16-year-old daughter, Caroline, and 11-year-old son, Ben. When he learns his recently deceased uncle has bequeathed him a 60-foot yacht once owned by [[Clark Gable]], he decides to take his family to the island of St. Pomme de Terre (\"Saint Potato\") to retrieve it so he can sell it. Katherine resists the idea, but agrees after Caroline announces she has just become engaged.\n\nWhen the Harveys arrive at the island, they discover that the yacht, ''Wanderer'', is in terrible condition. Upon hearing this, the yacht broker cancels his plan to send an experienced captain to help them sail it to Miami, and instead hires a local sailor, Captain Ron Rico, a one-eyed man with a very laid back attitude, and Navy veteran who claims to have piloted [[USS Saratoga (CV-60)|USS ''Saratoga'']]. He launches immediately when he sees the car he arrived in roll off the dock and sink. Its owner arrives at the dock and shoots at him.\n\nCaptain Ron takes Ben's money in a game of Monopoly, giving him beer to drink and charging him for it later, but shows loyalty to Martin, who he refers to as \"Boss\". Martin, who doesn't like him, calls him \"[[moron (psychology)|Moron]]\" in his diary, and believes that he doesn't know what he's doing.\n\nThe Harveys decide to stop off in the Caribbean, but learn that Captain Ron doesn't know how to navigate. While on a random island, Martin decides to go on a nature hike, but runs into [[guerrilla]]s led by General Armando. Captain Ron bargains for Martin's freedom by giving them a lift to the next island, and receiving some firearms in return to fight off pirates. This angers Martin, as he declares there will be no firearms on his yacht and tosses them overboard, before realizing that without them, he is going to have to give the guerrillas a lift.\n\nIn the yacht's cabin, Katherine shows Martin the initials of Clark Gable and [[Carole Lombard]] marked on the bedpost. They are so excited that they share their feelings and have passionate sex.\n\nWhen they arrive at their next destination, at a non-USA \"San Juan\", Martin and Katherine are arrested for smuggling the guerrillas. Caroline and Ben party with the locals and Captain Ron, which ends with Caroline getting a tattoo, Ben breaking his glasses, and Captain Ron losing his glass eye. Martin and Katherine are released from jail, but forced to leave that night. Martin decides to leave Captain Ron behind and they encounter pirates who steal the yacht, and are stuck floating in a raft.\n\nThey land in [[Cuba]] and discover the yacht there. The pirates find them, but with the help of Captain Ron, they are able to escape with the yacht. Captain Ron learns that they underrate Martin, and he decides to play hurt, forcing Martin to take control of the escape. Using the skills that Captain Ron taught them, they are able to get the sails up after the engine breaks from lack of oil to distance themselves from the pirates. The [[United States Coast Guard]], responding to a distress call from Ron, arrives and stops the pirates, creating a safe passage to Miami.\n\nThey arrive in Miami and part ways with Captain Ron. As they sail to their destination, they decide to turn the yacht around and keep it. In the final scene, Captain Ron appears to have cleaned up his appearance and has quickly taken on a new role as a captain for a wealthy couple and their small motorboat. Notably he is no longer wearing an eye patch.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Kurt Russell]] as Captain Ron Rico\n* [[Martin Short]] as Martin Harvey\n* [[Mary Kay Place]] as Katherine Harvey\n* [[Meadow Sisto]] as Caroline Harvey\n* [[Benjamin Salisbury]] as Ben Harvey\n* [[Sunshine Logro\u00f1o]] as General Armando (as Emannuel Logrono)\n* Jorge Luis Ramos as General Armando's Translator\n* [[J.A.
