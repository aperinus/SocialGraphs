Led by an [[ensemble cast]] consisting of many Leigh regulars, it stars [[Marianne Jean-Baptiste]] as Hortense, a well-educated black middle-class London [[Optometry|optometrist]], who was adopted as a baby and has chosen to trace her family history \u2013 and discovers that her birth mother, Cynthia, played by [[Brenda Blethyn]], is a working-class white woman with a dysfunctional family. [[Claire Rushbrook]] co-stars as Cynthia's other daughter Roxanne, while [[Timothy Spall]] and [[Phyllis Logan]] portray Cynthia's brother and sister-in-law, who have secrets of their own affecting their everyday family life.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Secrets & Lies |url=https://www.criterion.com/films/29202-secrets-lies |website=[[The Criterion Collection]] |language=en}}</ref>\n\nCritically acclaimed, the film won the [[1996 Cannes Film Festival]]'s [[Palme d'Or]], as well as the [[Best Actress Award (Cannes Film Festival)|Best Actress award]] for Blethyn. She also won the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Motion Picture \u2013 Drama]] for her portrayal. At the [[50th British Academy Film Awards]] (BAFTA), the film received seven nominations, winning both [[BAFTA Award for Best British Film|Best British Film]] and [[BAFTA Award for Best Original Screenplay|Best Original Screenplay]]. It also received five [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] nominations at the [[69th Academy Awards|69th Academy Awards ceremony]].\n\n==Plot==\nHortense Cumberbatch, a [[Black British|black]] [[Optometry|optometrist]] in London who was adopted as a child, has chosen to trace her family history after the death of her adoptive mother. Despite being warned by public officials about the troubles she could face by tracking down her birth mother, she continues her investigation and is surprised to learn that her birth mother is white.\n\nThe woman in question, Cynthia Purley, works in a cardboard box factory and lives in [[East London]] with her other daughter Roxanne, a street sweeper; the pair have a tense relationship. Cynthia's younger brother Maurice is a successful photographer who lives in the suburbs with his wife Monica. They also have domestic difficulties due to Monica's often distant temperament. Later scenes reveal that she suffers from depression over her inability to have children. Cynthia and Monica have never liked one another: Monica regards her sister-in-law as self-pitying and overly hysterical, while Cynthia deems Monica greedy and snobbish. For this reason, Maurice rarely sees Cynthia and Roxanne despite not living particularly far from them, but he and Monica both look forward to celebrating their niece's upcoming 21st birthday. When Maurice pays Cynthia a surprise visit, she breaks down in tears, berating her brother for his long absence. Before leaving, Maurice gives her money to pay for repairs on the house and tells her of his and Monica's wish to hold a barbecue for Roxanne's birthday.\n\nRoxanne is revealed to have a boyfriend, Paul, whom Cynthia has never met. This leads to an argument between mother and daughter; Roxanne storms out, leaving Cynthia in tears. Shortly thereafter, Hortense rings Cynthia and starts to enquire about \"baby Elizabeth Purley\", who she says was born in 1968. Cynthia realises that Hortense is the daughter she gave up for adoption as a teenager and hangs up the phone in distress; persevering, Hortense rings Cynthia again and eventually manages to persuade her to meet her. When they come face to face, Cynthia, not expecting Hortense to be black, insists that a mistake has been made with the birth records. Hortense convinces Cynthia to look at some documents pertaining to Hortense's birth. Cynthia remains convinced that Hortense is not her daughter until, suddenly, she retrieves a memory and begins to cry, stating that she is ashamed. Hortense then asks who her father was, to which Cynthia replies, \"You don't wanna know that, darling.\" The pair continue to converse, asking questions about one another's lives.\n\nSoon Hortense and Cynthia have struck up a friendship; Cynthia, who is not in the habit of going out, suddenly finds herself doing so frequently, catching the attention of Roxanne, who is confused by her mother's secrecy. On one of their meetings, Cynthia mentions to Hortense Roxanne's birthday party. She later asks Maurice if she can bring a \"mate from work\" to the barbecue; when he says yes, she relays this information to Hortense, who, despite her reservations, agrees to attend and pose as Cynthia's colleague.\n\nOn the day of the birthday party Monica tries to be welcoming, but she and Cynthia make passive-aggressive comments to one another. During the barbecue Hortense evasively answers the many questions that are put to her by the other guests. The party moves inside due to rain. While Hortense is in the bathroom, Cynthia, who has become increasingly nervous, reveals that she is Hortense's mother. Roxanne dismisses this claim, assuming that she has had too much to drink, but when Monica inadvertently confirms it as true, she is furious and storms out of the house. Maurice attempts to pacify the situation by confronting Roxanne at a nearby bus stop, and he and Paul manage to convince her to hear her mother out. Meanwhile, Cynthia and Monica quarrel. Cynthia says that Monica should try bringing up a child on her own, to which Monica, though visibly upset, says nothing. When Roxanne, Maurice and Paul return, Cynthia explains matters: she fell pregnant at fifteen and was sent away by her father; after the adoption she never expected Hortense to seek her out. Cynthia proceeds to berate Monica, and Maurice, coming to the latter's defence, reveals that she is physically incapable of having children. He loses his temper, exhorting those present to \"share [their] pain\" instead of harbouring resentments. He praises Hortense for having the courage to seek the truth. Monica breaks down crying after her secret has been revealed, and Cynthia goes to comfort Monica and the two women hug each other as a sign of them starting to reconcile. Cynthia then explains that Roxanne's father was an American medical student vacationing in Benidorm whom she met at a [[pub]]. One morning, Cynthia awoke and he had gone. Hortense again enquires as to the identity of her father. Cynthia replies, \"Don't break my heart, darling.\"\n\nAfter a while things have calmed down and Hortense pays a visit to Cynthia and Roxanne at their home. When Hortense reveals that she always wanted a sister, Roxanne says that she would be happy to introduce Hortense as her half-sister notwithstanding the long explanations that it would entail.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Timothy Spall]] as Maurice Purley\n* [[Brenda Blethyn]] as Cynthia Rose Purley\n* [[Marianne Jean-Baptiste]] as Hortense Cumberbatch\n* [[Phyllis Logan]] as Monica Purley\n* [[Claire Rushbrook]] as Roxanne Purley\n* [[Elizabeth Berrington]] as Jane\n* [[Michele Austin]] as Dionne\n* [[Lee Ross (actor)|Lee Ross]] as Paul\n* [[Lesley Manville]] as Jenny Ford, the Social Worker\n* [[Ron Cook]] as Stuart\n* [[Emma Amos (actress)|Emma Amos]] as Girl with Scar\n* Brian Bovell and [[Trevor Laird]] as Hortense's Brothers\n* [[Claire Perkins|Clare Perkins]] as Hortense's Sister-in-Law\n* [[Jonny Coyne]] as Fianc\u00e9\n}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nLeigh was inspired by \"people close to [him] who have had adoption-related experiences\" to make a film about [[adoption]].<ref name=\"indiewire\">{{cite web|url=http://www.indiewire.com/article/seven_questions_for_mike_leigh_director_of_secrets_lies|title=Seven Questions For Mike Leigh, Director Of 'Secrets & Lies'|date=27 September 1996|publisher=[[IndieWire]]|access-date=28 May 2013}}</ref> Speaking on the subject, he stated: \"I wanted for years to make a film which explored this predicament in a fictitious way. I also wanted to make a film about the new generation of young black people who are moving on and getting away from the ghetto stereotypes. And these were jumping off points for a film which turns out to be an exploration of roots and identity.\"<ref name=\"indiewire\"/>\n\nMany Leigh regulars make [[cameo appearance]]s in the film, most of whom serve as clients at Maurice's job, including [[Peter Wight (actor)|Peter Wight]] as the father in a family group, [[Gary McDonald (actor)|Gary McDonald]] as a boxer, [[Alison Steadman]] as a dog owner, [[Liz Smith (actress)|Liz Smith]] as a cat owner, [[Sheila Kelley (British actress)|Sheila Kelley]] as a fertile mother, [[Phil Davis (actor)|Phil Davis]] as a man in a suit, [[Anthony O'Donnell (actor)|Anthony O'Donnell]] as an uneasy man, [[Ruth Sheen]] as a laughing woman, and musician [[Mia Soteriou]] as a fianc\u00e9e.\n\n''Secrets and Lies'' was partly filmed in Whitehouse Way, [[Southgate, London]]. As in all of Leigh's films, the performances were created through months of intensive [[improvisation]]: Leigh and the individual actors created the characters at length. The emotional scene in the cafe, in which Cynthia realises that she is indeed Hortense's mother, was filmed in a [[long take|single uninterrupted take]] of just over seven minutes. It had been a common misunderstanding that Brenda Blethyn was not told before filming that Hortense was black, making her reaction in the scene more authentic. In a supplement on the [[Criterion Collection]] release of the film in March 2021, Leigh, in conversation with [[Gary Yershon]], clarified the method of improvisation and realisation of the scene.\n\n==Reception==\n[[File:Brenda Blethyn.jpg|thumb|[[Brenda Blethyn]] received positive reviews and the [[BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role]] for her performance.]]\nThe film was released to critical acclaim; on review aggregator [[Rotten Tomatoes]] it has an approval rating of 95% based on 40 reviews, with an average rating of 8.6/10; the site's critical consensus is: \"''Secrets & Lies'' delves into social issues with delicate aplomb and across-the-board incredible acting, and stands as one of writer-director Mike Leigh's most powerful works\".<ref>{{cite web |title=''Secrets & Lies'' (1996) |url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/secrets_and_lies/ |website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |publisher=[[Fandango Media]] |access-date=10 May 2021 }}</ref> On [[Metacritic]], the film holds a weighted average score of 91 out of 100 based on 27 reviews, indicating \"universal acclaim\".<ref>{{Metacritic film|title=Secrets & Lies |access-date=30 October 2012}}</ref>\n\nFilm critic [[Roger Ebert]], writing for the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' gave ''Secrets & Lies'' four out of four stars. He wrote that \"moment after moment, scene after scene, ''Secrets & Lies'' unfolds with the fascination of eavesdropping\", and added: \"[Leigh] finds a rhythm of life \u2013 not 'real life,' but real life as fashioned and shaped by all the art and skill his actors can bring to it \u2013 and slips into it, so that we are not particularly aware we're watching a film\". He called the film \"a flowering of his technique. It moves us on a human level, it keeps us guessing during scenes as unpredictable as life, and it shows us how ordinary people have a chance of somehow coping with their problems, which are rather ordinary, too\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/secrets-and-lies-1996 |first=Roger |last=Ebert |title=Secrets & Lies |publisher=RogertEbert.com |work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]] |date=25 October 1996 |access-date=30 October 2012 }}</ref> In 2009, he added the film to his ''[[The Great Movies|Great Movies]]'' collection.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20090128/REVIEWS08/901289993/1004 |title=Secrets and Lies Movie Review (1996) |author-link= Roger Ebert |first=Roger |last=Ebert |website=Rogerebert.suntimes.com |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090216013810/http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20090128/REVIEWS08/901289993/1004 |archive-date=2009-02-16 }}</ref>\n\nEdward Guthmann of the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' called the film Leigh's \"best and most accessible work to date\" and remarked that \"everyone's had these family skirmishes and confrontations in their lives, and it's remarkable to see them recorded so accurately and painfully on film. Leigh's marvelous achievement is not only in capturing emotional clarity on film, but also in illustrating the ways in which families start to heal and find a certain bravery in their efforts\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sfgate.com/movies/article/FILM-REVIEW-Secrets-Lies-Tells-the-Truth-2964567.php#ixzz2UhLmEq|first=Edward |last=Guthmann |title=FILM REVIEW \u2013 'Secrets & Lies' Tells the Truth|work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]|date=4 October 1996 |access-date= 30 October 2012}}</ref> Similarly, [[Kenneth Turan]] from the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' ranked the film among the best of the 14 features Leigh had written and directed by then. He found that ''Secrets & Lies'' was \"a piercingly honest, completely accessible piece of work that will go directly to the hearts of audiences who have never heard of him. If film means anything to you, if emotional truth is a quality you care about, this is an event that ought not be missed [...] Unforced, confident and completely involving, with exceptional acting aided by Dick Pope's unobtrusive camera work and John Gregory's telling editing, ''Secrets & Lies'' is filmmaking to savor\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1996-10-04/entertainment/ca-50161_1_palme-d-or |first=Kenneth |last=Turan |author-link=Kenneth Turan |title=Secrets & Lies|work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=4 October 1996 |access-date= 30 October 2020 }}</ref>\n\n''[[The Washington Post]]'' author [[Desson Howe]] felt that the film incorporated all the \"elements of humor, sweetness, cruelty and directness\" of Leigh's previous films but dubbed ''Secrets & Lies'' \"more emotional, tear-inducing and compassionate than its predecessors\".
