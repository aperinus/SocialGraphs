Lee]] resigns from the [[Union Army]] as [[Virginia in the American Civil War|Virginia]] votes to [[Secession in the United States|secede]] from the Union and join the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]], beginning the Civil War. Major Jackson, who is a professor at [[Virginia Military Institute]] in [[Lexington, Virginia|Lexington]] at the outset of the war, leaves his family behind to fight in the [[First Battle of Bull Run|Battle of Manassas]]. Jackson is asked by a retreating General [[Barnard Elliott Bee, Jr.|Barnard Bee]] for assistance against the Federal army who is pursuing them after a brief stand on Matthews Hill. In rallying his shaken troops, Bee launches the name of Stonewall into history and the [[Confederate States Army|Confederate Army]] routs the Federals at [[Henry House Hill]]. Jackson maintains steadfast discipline in his ranks during the battle despite suffering a wound to his left hand from a spent ball.\n\nMeanwhile, Chamberlain makes his transition from teacher to military officer and practices drilling his soldiers and is taught military tactics by Col. [[Adelbert Ames]], the commander of the [[20th Maine Volunteer Infantry Regiment]]. He is called to battle at the [[Battle of Fredericksburg|Union invasion of Fredericksburg]]. The Southern forces lead a fighting retreat as the Union army crosses the river to storm and loot [[Fredericksburg, Virginia|Fredericksburg]]. Outside the city, Lee, [[James Longstreet]] and Jackson have prepared an elaborate defense on [[Marye's Heights]] outside the town, and the movie focuses on Confederate defenses behind a formidable stone wall. Several Union brigades, including the [[Irish Brigade (U.S.)|Irish Brigade]], attempt to cross an open field and attack the wall, but are thrown back with heavy losses by Confederate rifle and artillery fire. At one point, two Irish units are forced into battle against one another, to the anguish of a Southern Irishman who believes he is killing his kin. Chamberlain leads an unsuccessful attack against Longstreet's defenses, led by Brig. Gen. [[Lewis Armistead]] and finds his unit pinned down in the open field. He survives by shielding himself with a corpse until nightfall; eventually he and surviving members of [[20th Maine Infantry Regiment|20th Maine]] are ordered to retreat and spend 2 nights on the battlefield, sleeping with the dead. Chamberlain and the defeated Union soldiers depart Fredericksburg. Jackson and Lee return to the city, and Lee is confronted by an angry citizen whose house has been destroyed by Union artillery.\n\nJackson spends the rest of the winter at a local [[Plantation complexes in the Southern United States|plantation]], [[Moss Neck Manor]], where he develops a friendship with a young girl who lives there. Later, Jackson discovers the child has died from [[scarlet fever]] and he begins to cry. Jackson's adjutant  asks why he weeps for this child but not for the thousands of dead soldiers, and Dr. [[Hunter McGuire]] states that Jackson is weeping for everyone. Jackson is soon reunited with his wife and newborn child just before the [[Battle of Chancellorsville]].\n\nOutside [[Chancellorsville, Virginia|Chancellorsville]], Lee identifies that the [[Army of Northern Virginia]] faces an opposing force almost twice their size. Jackson calls upon his chaplain, Beverly Tucker Lacy who knows the area, and asks him to find a route by which the Confederate forces can infiltrate in secret.  Jackson then leads his forces in a surprise attack on an unprepared [[XI Corps (Union Army)|Union 11th Corps]]. Although his men initially rout the opponents, they quickly become confused in the melee, and Jackson's attack is stalled. While scouting a path at night, Jackson is caught in no-mans-land between the 2 armies and badly wounded by his own men, who had mistaken him and his staff for Union [[cavalry]]. During his evacuation, his [[Litter (rescue basket)|litter]] bearers are targeted by artillery and drop Jackson on the ground. He is then taken to a field hospital where his arm is amputated. Lee remarks that while Jackson has lost his left arm, he (Lee) has lost his right. Jackson dies shortly after, of pneumonia he had contracted during recovery. Jackson's body is returned to Lexington, accompanied by VMI Cadets and covered by the new [[Flags of the Confederate States of America|Confederate flag]].\n\n==Cast==\n===Confederate Army (by rank)===\n* [[Robert Duvall]] as General [[Robert E.

Among them, [[2nd South Carolina String Band]] portrays the players of \"[[The Bonnie Blue Flag]]\" during a troops entertainment music show.

One scene towards the end of the extended cut of the film features Chamberlain and his wife, Fanny, attending a production of Shakespeare's ''[[Julius Caesar (play)|Julius Caesar]]'' in which Booth plays [[Marcus Junius Brutus]]. Chamberlain and his wife have a conversation with Booth and his fellow actors following the end of the play. Another scene cut from the film features a performance in Washington, D.C. in which Booth stars in ''[[Macbeth]]'', which is being seen by President Lincoln. When he gives the famous \"dagger of the mind\" soliloquy, he looks directly at Lincoln while reciting it. Later, when Booth is offered the chance to meet with Lincoln, he refuses.\n\nA sequence dealing with the [[Battle of Antietam]] was removed from the film. The battle was seen mostly from the perspectives of Jackson (who played a major strategic role in the battle) and Chamberlain (whose corps was held in reserve). In the Director's Cut the entire sequence at Antietam is shown; the Antietam battle scenes mostly depict the fighting in [[Miller's Cornfield]], where soldiers from the opposite sides fired at each other from just a few meters away.\n\n==Soundtrack==\n{{Main|Gods and Generals (soundtrack)}}\nIn 2003, the [[Gods and Generals (soundtrack)|film score]] was composed by [[John Frizzell (composer)|John Frizzell]], with some minor contributions by [[Randy Edelman]], who composed the score for the previous ''[[Gettysburg (1993 film)|Gettysburg]]''.  The soundtrack is notable for containing a new song commissioned for the movie and written and performed by [[Bob Dylan]], ''Cross the Green Mountain''. The track was later included on the compilation album ''[[The Bootleg Series Vol. 8: Tell Tale Signs]]''. The music of the [[2nd South Carolina String Band]] also appears on the soundtrack.\n\n==Video game==\n{{Main|Gods and Generals (video game)}}\nA video game based on the movie was released on March 1, 2003.

He also criticizes the relative lack of attention given to the motivations of Union soldiers fighting in the war. He excoriates the film for allegedly implying, in agreement with Lost Cause mythology, that the South was more \"sincerely [[Christianity in the United States|Christian]].\" Woodworth concludes that the film, through \"judicial omission,\" presents \"a distorted view of the Civil War.\"<ref name=\"Film Review: Gods and Generals\"/>\n\nHistorian William B.
