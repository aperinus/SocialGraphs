''Evil Dead II'' was produced by [[Robert Tapert]] and stars [[Bruce Campbell]] as [[Ash Williams]], who vacations with his girlfriend to a remote cabin in the woods. He discovers an audio tape of recitations from a book of ancient texts, and when the recording is played, it unleashes a number of [[demon]]s which [[Demonic possession|possess]] and torment him.\n\nAfter the critical and commercial failure of ''[[Crimewave]]'' (1985), Raimi, Tapert, and Campbell began work on a sequel to ''The Evil Dead'' at the insistence of their publicist [[Irvin Shapiro]]. Having endorsed the original film, author [[Stephen King]] brought the project to the attention of producer [[Dino De Laurentiis]], with whom he had been making his [[directorial debut]] ''[[Maximum Overdrive]]'' (1986); De Laurentiis agreed to provide financial backing, and assigned the filmmakers a considerably larger budget than they had worked with on the original film. Although Raimi had devised a premise set in the [[Middle Ages]] and involving [[time travel]], De Laurentiis requested that the film be similar to its predecessor.\n\n''Evil Dead II'' was shot in [[Wadesboro, North Carolina]] and [[Detroit, Michigan]] in 1986, and featured extensive [[stop-motion animation]] and [[prosthetic makeup]] effects created by a team of artists that included [[Mark Shostrom]], [[Greg Nicotero]], [[Robert Kurtzman]] and [[Tom Sullivan (special effects artist)|Tom Sullivan]], the latter of whom returned from the original film. The finished film was released in the United States on March 13, 1987; due to its high level of violence, it was released through a pseudonymous distributor to curb an anticipated [[X rating]] from the [[Motion Picture Association of America]]. Much like ''The Evil Dead'', it was widely acclaimed by critics, with praise being reserved for its humor, Raimi's direction and Campbell's performance - many having considered it superior to its predecessor and similarly as [[List of films considered the best|one of the greatest horror films ever made]]. Despite being given a somewhat [[limited release]], it was a minor box office success, grossing just under $6 million.\n\nAs with the first film, ''Evil Dead II'' has accumulated a large, international [[Cult film|cult following]]. A direct sequel utilizing Raimi's original premise, ''[[Army of Darkness]]'', followed in 1992. It was later followed by a [[Reboot (fiction)|soft reboot]] and continuation, ''[[Evil Dead (2013 film)|Evil Dead]]'', which was released in 2013, and a television series, ''[[Ash vs Evil Dead]]'', which aired from 2015 to 2018.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be set between 400 to 700 words only. -->\n[[Ash Williams]] and his girlfriend, Linda, take a romantic vacation to a seemingly abandoned cabin in the woods. While in the cabin, Ash plays a tape of [[archaeologist]] Raymond Knowby, the cabin's previous inhabitant, reciting passages from the \"Book of the Dead\", ''[[Necronomicon Ex-Mortis]]'', which he has discovered during an archaeological dig. The recorded incantation unleashes an evil force (also known as the Kandarian Demon) that kills and later possesses Linda, turning her into a \"deadite\". Ash is then forced to decapitate her with a shovel and bury her in a shallow grave near the cabin. At dawn, the evil force throws Ash through the woods. He briefly becomes possessed by the demon, but when day breaks, he is inexplicably returned to normal.\n\nHe attempts to flee the area but finds that the bridge to the cabin has been destroyed. The spirit chases him back to the cabin, where Linda's revived head attacks him and bites his hand. He runs to the shed, where her headless body attacks him with a chainsaw, but he overpowers and slashes the deadite Linda to death. His right hand becomes possessed and tries to kill him, and he severs it with the chainsaw before attempting to shoot it with a shotgun, but the hand mocks him and ultimately escapes. Meanwhile, Knowby's daughter Annie, and her research partner, Ed Getley, return from the dig with the missing pages of the ''Necronomicon'', only to find the destroyed bridge. They enlist repairman Jake and his girlfriend Bobby Joe to show them another route to the cabin, where they find an embattled Ash covered in blood. Thinking that he murdered his parents, Annie and the others lock him in the cellar.\n\nThe four new arrivals listen to the rest of Knowby's recording, detailing how his wife Henrietta was possessed by the Kandarian Demon, and that he killed her and buried her in the cellar. Henrietta, now a deadite, possesses Ed; Ash dismembers him with an axe. Bobby Joe tries to escape, but demonically possessed trees attack and drag her to her death. Annie translates two of the ''Necronomicon''{{'}}s pages before Jake turns on them and throws the pages into the cellar, forcing them at gunpoint to find Bobby Joe. Ash becomes possessed once again and attacks Jake. Annie retreats to the cabin and accidentally stabs Jake (mistaking him for the possessed Ash) before Henrietta kills him. Deadite Ash tries to kill Annie, but returns to his normal self upon seeing Linda's necklace.\n\nWith Annie's help, Ash modifies the chainsaw, attaches it to the stump of his right arm, and [[sawn-off shotgun|cuts the shotgun's barrel]]. After finding the missing pages of the ''Necronomicon'' in the cellar, Ash kills Henrietta. The trees outside begin to destroy the cabin. Annie reveals that she has only read the first half of the incantation and attempts to finish the second half. As she reads it, Ash's severed hand uses a Kandarian dagger to stab her in the back. She manages to complete the incantation before succumbing to her wound. The incantation opens up a whirling temporal vortex which not only draws in the demon, but also Ash and his [[Oldsmobile Delta 88]].\n\nAsh and his Oldsmobile land in the Middle Ages. A group of knights confront him and initially mistake him for a deadite, but are quickly distracted when a real harpy-like deadite appears. Ash blasts it with his shotgun and they hail him as a hero who has come to save them, causing him to break down and scream in anguish.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Bruce Campbell]] as [[Ash Williams]]\n* Sarah Berry as Annie Knowby\n* [[Dan Hicks (actor)|Dan Hicks]] as Jake\n* [[Kassie DePaiva|Kassie Wesley]] as Bobby Joe\n* Denise Bixler as Linda\n** Snowy Winters as Dancing demon Linda<ref>{{cite book|last=Mitchell|first=Charles P.|date=2001|title=The Complete H.

Working with screenwriter [[Sheldon Lettich]], Raimi settled on a story in which Ash was sucked through a [[time portal]] to the [[Middle Ages]], where he would encounter more [[deadites]]. Shapiro loved the concept, and in May 1984 took out advertisements in trade magazines to promote the project, then titled ''Evil Dead II: Evil Dead and the Army of Darkness''. After [[Universal Pictures]] and [[20th Century Fox]] passed on it, the sequel was shelved in favor of Raimi's next film, ''[[Crimewave]]'' (1985), a [[comedy film|comedy]]/[[crime film]] cowritten with [[Coen brothers|Joel and Ethan Coen]].<ref name=\"BookDead\">{{cite web|url=http://www.bookofthedead.ws/website/evil_dead_2_production.html|title=Evil Dead II - Production|publisher=Book of the Dead|access-date=March 26, 2020}}</ref>\n\nAfter ''Crimewave'' was released to critical and audience disinterest, Raimi and his partners at [[Renaissance Pictures]], producer [[Robert Tapert]] and actor/co-producer [[Bruce Campbell]], took Shapiro up on his sequel offer, knowing that another flop would further stall their already-lagging careers. Development of ''Evil Dead II'' initially began in collaboration with [[Embassy Pictures]], which had co-financed and distributed ''Crimewave'', but the filmmakers eventually felt that they were being stalled after five months' pre-production work, and began conducting interviews with prospective cast and crew members.<ref name=\"BookDead\" /> Around this time, producer [[Dino De Laurentiis]], the owner of production and distribution company [[De Laurentiis Entertainment Group]] (DEG), asked Raimi if he would be interested in directing an adaptation of the [[Stephen King]] novel ''[[Thinner (novel)|Thinner]]''. Raimi turned down the offer, but De Laurentiis remained in touch with the young filmmaker.<ref name=companion>{{cite book|title=The Evil Dead Companion|last=Warren|first=Bill|publisher=[[Macmillan Publishers]]|year=2001|isbn=9780312275013|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wBrJ3M71rUIC}}</ref>{{rp|135}}\n\nThe ''Thinner'' adaptation was part of a deal between De Laurentiis and King to produce several adaptations of King's successful [[horror fiction|horror]] novels and short stories. At the time, King was directing the first such adaptation, ''[[Maximum Overdrive]]'' (1986), based on his short story \"[[Trucks (short story)|Trucks]]\". He had dinner with a crew member who had been among those interviewed by Raimi and his colleagues about ''Evil Dead II'', and told King that the film was having trouble attracting funding. Upon hearing this, King, who had written a glowing review of the first film that helped it become an audience favorite at [[Cannes Film Festival|Cannes]], called De Laurentiis and asked him to fund the film.<ref name=companion/>{{rp|104}} Although initially skeptical, De Laurentiis met with Renaissance, who highlighted the first film's extremely high revenue in the Italian market. Within twenty minutes, De Laurentiis agreed to finance ''Evil Dead II'' for $3.6 million. Raimi and Tapert had desired $4 million for the production, but De Laurentiis requested a film that was similar to its predecessor instead of their original medieval-themed proposal, which was instead used for the second sequel, ''[[Army of Darkness]]'' (1992).<ref name=companion/>{{rp|106}}\n\n===Writing===\nThough they had only recently received the funding necessary to produce the film, the script had been written for some time, having been composed largely during the production of ''Crimewave''. Raimi contacted his old friend [[Scott Spiegel]], who had collaborated with Campbell and others on the [[Super 8 mm film]]s they had produced during their childhood in [[Michigan]]. Most of these films had been comedies, and Spiegel felt that ''Evil Dead II'' should be less straight horror than the first. Initially, the opening sequence included all five of the original film's characters; however, in an effort to save time and money, all but Ash and Linda were cut from the final draft. The film went through several other drafts, including a group of escaped convicts holding Ash captive in the cabin while searching for buried treasure.<ref name=companion/>{{rp|109\u2013110}}\n\nSpiegel and Raimi wrote most of the film in their house in [[Silver Lake, Los Angeles|Silver Lake, Los Angeles, California]], where they were living with the aforementioned Coen brothers, as well as actors [[Frances McDormand]], [[Kathy Bates]], and [[Holly Hunter]] (Hunter was the primary inspiration for the Bobby Jo character). Due both to the distractions of their house guests and the films they were involved with, ''Crimewave'' and [[Josh Becker (filmmaker)|Josh Becker]]'s ''[[Thou Shalt Not Kill... Except]]'', the script took a long time to finish.<ref name=companion/>{{rp|109}}\n\nAmong the film's many inspirations include the [[The Three Stooges|Three Stooges]] and [[slapstick comedy]] films; Ash's fights with his disembodied hand come from a film made by Spiegel as a teenager titled ''[[Attack of the Helping Hand]]'', which was itself inspired by television commercials advertising [[Hamburger Helper]]. The \"laughing room\" scene, where all the objects in the room seemingly come to life and begin to cackle maniacally along with Ash, came about after Spiegel jokingly used a gooseneck lamp to visually demonstrate a [[Popeye]]-esque laugh. Spiegel's humorous influence can be seen throughout the film, perhaps most prominently in certain visual jokes; for instance, when Ash traps his rogue hand under a pile of books, on top is ''[[A Farewell to Arms]]''.<ref name=companion/>{{rp|111}}\n\nWhile Raimi and Campbell have stated that ''Evil Dead 2'' was intended as a direct sequel, there are differences between the first movie and the recap at the beginning of the second: for example, the Necronomicon is destroyed in a fire by Ash during the conclusion of ''The Evil Dead'' yet remains intact in ''Evil Dead 2''. The corpses of Ash's friends from the first movie are absent, and they are never mentioned. The cabin itself remains perfectly intact until the events of this film despite much of it having been destroyed in the original film.\n\n===Filming===\nWith the script completed, and a production company secured, [[principal photography]] began. The production commenced in [[Wadesboro, North Carolina]], not far from De Laurentiis' offices in [[Wilmington, North Carolina|Wilmington]]. De Laurentiis had wanted them to film in his elaborate Wilmington studio, but the production team felt uneasy being so close to the producer, so they moved to Wadesboro, approximately three hours away. [[Steven Spielberg]] had previously filmed ''[[The Color Purple (film)|The Color Purple]]'' in Wadesboro, and the large white farmhouse used as an exterior location in that film became the production office for ''Evil Dead II''. Most of the film was shot in the woods near that farmhouse, or J.R. Faison Junior High School, which is where the interior cabin set was located.<ref name=companion/>{{rp|113}}\n\n[[Mark Shostrom]] served as the film's makeup effects supervisor, and delegated work to [[Robert Kurtzman]], [[Greg Nicotero]], and [[Howard Berger]] of [[KNB EFX Group]].{{sfn|Uram|1992|p=39}} The shot of undead Henrietta's flying eyeball was accomplished using a [[ping pong ball]] provided and painted by KNB EFX;{{sfn|Uram|1992|p=40}} effects artist Verne Hyde, who joined the North Carolina unit in 1986 after filming had already begun, experimented with various rigs in order to achieve the effect Raimi desired.{{sfn|Uram|1992|p=40}} It was ultimately achieved by mounting the eyeball on a small, spinning motor, attached to a wand bolted directly onto the camera.{{sfn|Uram|1992|p=40}}\n\n[[Ted Raimi]], director Sam's younger brother, had been briefly involved in the first film, acting as a [[fake Shemp]], but in ''Evil Dead II'' he plays a larger role as the undead Henrietta. Raimi wore a full-body, [[latex]] costume, and was also made to crouch in a small hole in the floor acting as a \"cellar\"; on one day, he did both. Raimi became extremely overheated, to the point that his costume was filled with liters of sweat; Nicotero describes pouring the fluid into several [[Dixie Cup|Dixie cups]] so as to get it out of the costume. The sweat is also visible on-screen, dripping out of the costume's ear, in the scene where Henrietta spins around over Annie's head.<ref name=companion/>{{rp|125}}\n\nFor Ash's chainsaw hand, effects artist Verne Hyde modified a real chainsaw, replacing its gasoline engine with a small, 12-volt [[electric motor]], leaving space for Campbell to insert his hand into the body of the saw.{{sfn|Uram|1992|p=40}} The teeth of the saw were filed down for safety purposes, and tobacco smoke was pumped through a plastic tube that ran up Campbell's leg to simulate chainsaw smoke.{{sfn|Uram|1992|p=40}}\n\nThe crew sneaked various [[in-joke]]s into the film itself, such as the clawed glove of [[Freddy Krueger]] (the primary antagonist of [[Wes Craven]]'s [[A Nightmare on Elm Street (franchise)|''A Nightmare on Elm Street'' series]] of [[slasher film]]s) which hangs in the cabin's basement and tool shed. This was, at least partially, a reference to a scene in the original ''[[A Nightmare on Elm Street]]'' where the character Nancy Thompson (portrayed by [[Heather Langenkamp]]) dozes off watching the original ''Evil Dead'' on a television set in her room. In turn, that scene was a reference to the torn ''[[The Hills Have Eyes (1977 film)|The Hills Have Eyes]]'' poster seen in the original ''Evil Dead'' film, which was itself a reference to a torn ''[[Jaws (film)|Jaws]]'' poster in ''The Hills Have Eyes''.{{citation needed|date=January 2020}} The real life clawed glove appearing in ''Evil Dead II'' has been attributed to Shostrom, who was also working on ''[[A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors]]'' at around the same time as ''Evil Dead II'', suggesting he borrowed it from the ''Dream Warriors'' set for a day.<ref>{{cite web | title=A Nightmare On Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors \u2013 Stalking Dreams 30 Years Later | url=https://crypticrock.com/nightmare-elm-street-3-dream-warriors-stalking-dreams-30-years-later/ | date=February 20, 2017 | access-date=January 1, 2020 | author=Jon Wamsley | website=Cryptic Rock}}</ref> The rat seen in the cellar was nicknamed \"Se\u00f1or Cojones\" by the crew (\"[[Spanish profanity#Cojones|cojones]]\" is [[Spanish language|Spanish slang]] for \"[[testicles]]\").{{citation needed|date=May 2022}}\n\nAt the film's [[wrap party]], the crew held a talent contest, where Raimi and Campbell sang [[the Byrds]]' \"[[Eight Miles High]]\", with Nicotero on [[guitar]].<ref>Mentioned in Evil Dead II audio commentary</ref>\n\n==Music==\nThe score was composed by [[Joseph LoDuca]] who also composed the other two scores in the Evil Dead trilogy.

As DEG was a signatory to the [[Motion Picture Association of America]] (MPAA), Raimi was contractually obliged to shoot the film with the intention of it earning an [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system#R rating|R rating]]. Upon reviewing the completed film, DEG's executives felt that ''Evil Dead II'' would almost certainly receive an [[X rating]], thereby limiting its commercial prospects.<ref name=\"BookDead\" /> Lawrence Gleason, the company's president of marketing and distribution, felt that if it were to be cut for an R, the film \"would have been about 62 minutes long\" and that both Raimi's vision and the audience's enjoyment would have been sabotaged as a result.<ref name=\"Los Angeles Times\">{{cite web | url = https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1987-03-13-ca-5536-story.html | title = How 'Evil Dead 2' doged the Kiss of Death--an X | author = Jack Mathews|  work =[[Los Angeles Times]] | date = March 13, 1987| access-date = March 26, 2020}}</ref>\n\nUltimately, DEG decided not to submit ''Evil Dead II'' to the MPAA for review or be credited onscreen for their involvement in it. Instead, a [[shell company]] run by De Laurentiis' son-in-law Alex De Benedetti, Rosebud Releasing Corporation, was set up to handle the film's US release, allowing it to be shown unrated. Although Rosebud technically did not have a distribution network, DEG had already booked the film in 340 cinemas across the country, and had created and paid for the film's advertising campaign.<ref name=\"Los Angeles Times\" /> Rosebud's logo, a rose blooming in [[time-lapse]] photography against a painted sky backdrop, was designed and shot by Raimi himself.<ref name=\"BookDead\" />\n\n===Home media===\nThe film was released on [[VHS]] by [[Vestron Video]] in 1987. Another VHS release came from [[Anchor Bay Entertainment]] on February 17, 1998.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Evil Dead 2 [VHS]|website=[[Amazon.com]]|asin = 6304819935}}</ref> In a similar fashion to the first ''Evil Dead'' film and ''Army of Darkness'', there have been numerous [[DVD]] releases of ''Evil Dead II''.
