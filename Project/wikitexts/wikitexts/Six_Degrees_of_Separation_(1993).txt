In October 1983, Hampton came to the New York apartment of [[Inger McCabe Elliott]] and her husband [[Osborn Elliott]], who allowed him to spend the night in the apartment. The next morning, Inger found Hampton in bed with another man and later called the police. The Elliotts told their friend, writer John Guare, the story, which inspired him to write the play years later.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=9ugCAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA43&lpg=PA43&dq=stockard+channing+inger+elliott&source=bl&ots=3rs0iOwbSe&sig=E-5y6DRK5DqvvPcvkkYW6hG1H7s&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CB8Q6AEwAGoVChMI4-vi7u36xgIVyFk-Ch0sMgD7#v=onepage&q=stockard%20channing%20inger%20elliott&f=false New York Mag The Story of David Hampton] accessed 7-27-2015</ref><ref name=\"gerston\">{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/03/06/movies/film-stockard-channing-goes-west.html| title=Stockard Channing Goes West |work=[[The New York Times]] |access-date=2013-09-19 |first=Jill |last=Gerston |date=6 March 1994}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n[[Fifth Avenue]] socialite Ouisa Kittredge and her art dealer husband Flan are parents of \"two at [[Harvard University|Harvard]] and a girl at [[Groton School|Groton]]\". However, the narrow world inhabited by the Kittredges and their public status as people interested in the arts make them easy prey for Paul. A skillful con-artist, Paul mysteriously appears at their door one night, injured and bleeding, claiming to be a close college friend of their [[Ivy League]] kids, as well as the son of [[Sidney Poitier]].\n\nOuisa and Flan are much impressed by Paul's fine taste, keen wit, articulate literary expositions and surprising culinary skill. His appealing facade soon has the Kittredges putting him up, lending him money and taking satisfaction in his praise for their posh lifestyle. Paul's scheme continues until, after he brings home a hustler, his actual [[indigence]] is revealed. The shocked Kittredges kick him out when it is revealed that they are but the most recent victims of the duplicity with which Paul has charmed his way into many upper-crust homes along the [[Upper East Side]].\n\nPaul's schemes become highbrow-legend, anecdotal ''onaccounta'', which are bantered about at their cocktail parties. In the end, Paul has a profound effect on the many individuals who encounter him, linking them in their shared experience.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Stockard Channing]] as Louisa \"Ouisa\" Kittredge\n*[[Will Smith]] as Paul\n*[[Donald Sutherland]] as Flanders \"Flan\" Kittredge\n*[[Ian McKellen]] as Geoffrey Miller\n*[[Mary Beth Hurt]] as Kitty\n*[[Heather Graham]] as Elizabeth\n*[[Bruce Davison]] as Larkin\n*[[Richard Masur]] as Dr. Fine\n*[[Anthony Michael Hall]] as Trent Conway\n*[[Daniel von Bargen]] as Detective\n*[[Eric Thal]] as Rick\n*[[Kelly Bishop]] as Adele\n*[[Anthony Rapp]] as Ben\n*[[Oz Perkins]] as Woodrow \"Woody\" Kittredge (as Osgood Perkins II)\n*[[Catherine Kellner]] as Talbot \"Tess\" Kittredge\n*[[J.
