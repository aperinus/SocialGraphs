It stars [[Roddy McDowall]], [[Kim Hunter]], [[Bradford Dillman]] and [[Ricardo Montalb\u00e1n]]. It is the third of five films in the original ''[[Planet of the Apes]]'' series produced by [[Arthur P. Jacobs]], the second being ''[[Beneath the Planet of the Apes]]'' (1970).<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.mediacircus.net/pota.html| title=Those Damned Dirty Apes!| access-date=2011-08-03| publisher=www.mediacircus.net}}</ref> Its plot centers on many social issues of the day including scientific [[experimentation on animals]], nuclear war and government intrusion. The film was well received by critics, getting the best reviews of the four ''[[Planet of the Apes (1968 film)|Planet of the Apes]]'' sequels. It was followed by ''[[Conquest of the Planet of the Apes]]''.\n\n==Plot==\n{{Long plot|date=February 2022}}\nDuring the events of the preceding film ''[[Beneath the Planet of the Apes]]'', occurring off-screen, [[Cornelius (Planet of the Apes)|Cornelius]] and [[Zira (Planet of the Apes)|Zira]] escaped Earth prior to its destruction when they accompanied their fellow chimpanzee [[Dr. Milo (Planet of the Apes)|Dr. Milo]] in salvaging and repairing the spaceship originally used by [[Taylor (Planet of the Apes)|Taylor]]. The shock wave of Earth's destruction sends the ship through a [[time warp (science fiction)|time warp]] that brings the apes to 1973 Earth, splashing down off the Pacific coast of the United States.\n\nThe apes are transported to a secluded ward of the [[Los Angeles Zoo]], under the observation of scientists Dr. Stephanie Branton and Dr. Lewis Dixon. With Dr. Milo explaining their situation in private, the apes decide not to let the humans know that they can speak while agreeing not to reveal Earth's destruction from the Ape War. However Zira's impatience exposes the apes' power of speech during an experiment and Dr. Milo is killed moments later by a zoo gorilla who became agitated by the chimpanzees' argument. Lewis tries to communicate with the apes that he is peaceful and he wishes to treat them as equals, winning their friendship as a result.\n\nA Presidential Commission is formed to investigate the return of Taylor's spaceship and determine how atypically intelligent apes came to be aboard it. The apes are brought before the Commission, where they publicly reveal their ability to speak. The council asks them about Taylor, but Cornelius and Zira tell them that they know nothing about him. They reveal that they came from the future and escaped Earth when war broke out. They are welcomed as guests of the government. Cornelius and Zira secretly tell Stephanie and Lewis that they did know about Taylor, explain how humans are treated in the ape-dominated future, and about the Earth's destruction. Stephanie and Lewis are shocked but still sympathetic, the latter advising the couple to keep this information secret until they can gauge the potential reaction of their hosts.\n\nThe apes become celebrities, and are lavished with gifts and media attention. They come to the attention of the President's Science Advisor [[Dr. Hasslein (Planet of the Apes)|Dr. Otto Hasslein]], who discovers Zira is pregnant. Fearing for the future of the human race, he offers her champagne (for which she has developed a taste) to loosen her inhibitions and questions her further while recording it. Her candid responses enable him to convince the Commission that Cornelius and Zira must be subjected to more rigorous questioning.\n\nHasslein insists that he simply wants to know how apes became dominant over men. Cornelius reveals that the human race will cause its own downfall and become dominated by simians, and that simian aggression against humans will lead to Earth's destruction by a weapon made by humans. Zira explains that the gorillas started the war, and the orangutans supported the gorillas, but the chimpanzees had nothing to do with it. Hasslein suspects that the apes are not speaking the whole truth.\n\nDuring the original hearing, Zira accidentally reveals that she dissected humans in the course of her work. Hasslein orders Lewis to administer a [[truth serum]] to her while Cornelius is confined elsewhere. Lewis assures Zira that the serum will have the same effect as champagne. As a result of the serum, Hasslein learns details about Zira's examination and experimentation on humans along with her knowledge of Taylor.\n\nZira joins Cornelius in confinement while Hasslein takes his findings to the [[President of the United States|President]], who reluctantly must abide by the council's ruling to have Zira's pregnancy be terminated and that both apes be sterilized. In their chambers, Cornelius labels Hasslein and the others savages for Zira's treatment as she reminds Cornelius that she did the same thing to humans and Taylor called them savages. Zira is relieved to have revealed the truth because she was tired of lying. Cornelius fears that the truth will get them killed. When an orderly arrives to offer the apes food, his playful reference to their unborn child as a \"little monkey\" makes Cornelius lose his temper and he knocks the orderly to the floor, before escaping with Zira. Cornelius assumes he merely knocked out the orderly, but he is actually dead. Hasslein uses the tragedy in support of his claim that the apes are a threat and calls for their execution, but is ordered by the President to bring them in alive as he will not endorse punishment for the orderly's death until due process has been served.\n\nBranton and Dixon help the apes to escape, taking them to a circus run by [[Armando (Planet of the Apes)|Se\u00f1or Armando]], where an ape named Heloise has just given birth. Zira gives birth to a son, whom she names Milo in honor of their deceased friend. When Hasslein, knowing that Zira's labor was imminent, orders a search of all circuses and zoos, Armando insists the apes leave for their safety. Lewis arranges for the apes to hide out in the shipyard in the Los Angeles harbor until the coast is clear to return to the circus as it heads to Florida, giving Cornelius a pistol as the couple does not want to be taken alive.\n\nHasslein tracks the apes to the shipping yard and mortally wounds Zira when she refuses to hand over the infant, firing several shots into the infant before being killed by Cornelius. Cornelius is shot by a sniper and falls. Zira tosses the dead baby over the side and crawls to die with her husband, witnessed by a grieving Lewis and Stephanie.\n\nAs Armando's circus prepares to leave for Florida, it is revealed that Zira switched babies with Heloise prior to leaving the circus and that Armando is aware. Milo then begins to talk.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Roddy McDowall]] as Dr. Cornelius\n* [[Kim Hunter]] as Dr. Zira\n* [[Bradford Dillman]] as Dr. Lewis Dixon\n* [[Natalie Trundy]] as Dr. Stephanie Branton\n* [[Eric Braeden]] as Dr. Otto Hasslein\n* [[William Windom (actor)|William Windom]] as President of the United States\n* [[Sal Mineo]] as Dr. Milo\n* [[Albert Salmi]] as E-1\n* [[Jason Evers]] as E-2\n* [[John Randolph (actor)|John Randolph]] as the Chairman\n* [[Harry Lauter]] as General Winthrop\n* [[M.

A new ape character of [[Dr. Milo (Planet of the Apes)|Dr. Milo]] is introduced played by actor [[Sal Mineo]]. [[Charlton Heston]], star of the first film and supporting actor in the second, appears in this third installment only in two brief flashback sequences.\n\n==Production==\nDespite ''[[Beneath the Planet of the Apes]]'' ending in a way that seemed to prevent the series from continuing, 20th Century Fox still wanted a sequel. Roddy McDowall, in the franchise documentary ''Behind the Planet of the Apes'', stated that [[Arthur P. Jacobs]] sent ''Beneath'' screenwriter [[Paul Dehn]] a telegram concerning the sequel that read \"Apes exist, Sequel required.\" and Dehn decided to create an out from the destructive ending of ''Beneath'' by having Cornelius and Zira going back in time with a [[Leonardo da Vinci]]-like ape after fixing Taylor's spaceship before the Earth was destroyed. Dehn also consulted [[Pierre Boulle]], writer of the ''[[Planet of the Apes (novel)|Planet of the Apes]]'' novel, to imbue his script with similar satirical elements. The screenplay, originally titled ''Secret of the Planet of the Apes'', accommodated the smaller budget by having fewer people in ape make-up, and attracted director [[Don Taylor (director born 1920)|Don Taylor]] by its humor and focus on the chimpanzee couple.\n\nDehn also added to the latter part of the film regarding the chase for Cornelius, Zira and their son references to racial conflicts and a few religious overtones to the story of Jesus - a line of dialogue even has the President comparing the plan to kill an unborn child to the [[Massacre of the Innocents]].<ref>\"The Secret Behind Escape\", ''Escape from the Planet of the Apes'' Blu-ray</ref><ref>Hofstede, David.

Hunter stated that despite the friendly atmosphere on the set, she and [[Roddy McDowall]] felt a sense of isolation for being the only people dressed as chimpanzees.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} Production was rushed due to the low budget, being filmed in only six weeks,<ref>[http://pota.goatley.com/magazines/starlog-1990-11.pdf Chimp Life], by Tom Weaver & Michael Brunas - ''[[Starlog]]'' (November 1990)</ref> from November 30, 1970 to January 19, 1971.<ref>''Planet of the apes : 40-year evolution'' / written by [[Lee Pfeiffer]] & [[Dave Worrall]].
