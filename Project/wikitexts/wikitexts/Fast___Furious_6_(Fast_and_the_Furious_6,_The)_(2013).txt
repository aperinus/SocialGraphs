'Furious 6'|website=[[Entertainment Weekly]]}}</ref>) is a 2013 American [[action film]] directed by [[Justin Lin]] and written by [[Chris Morgan (filmmaker)|Chris Morgan]]. It is the sequel to ''[[Fast Five]]'' (2011) and is the sixth installment in the ''[[Fast & Furious]]'' franchise. It stars [[Vin Diesel]] as [[Dominic Toretto]] and [[Paul Walker]] as [[Brian O'Conner]], alongside [[Dwayne Johnson]], [[Michelle Rodriguez]], [[Jordana Brewster]], [[Tyrese Gibson]], [[Ludacris|Chris \"Ludacris\" Bridges]], [[Sung Kang]], [[Luke Evans]], and [[Gina Carano]]. In the film, Toretto, O'Conner, and the team are offered amnesty for their crimes by helping [[Diplomatic Security Service|DSS]] agent Luke Hobbs to apprehend a mercenary group, one member of which is Toretto's presumed deceased lover, Letty Ortiz (Rodriguez).\n\nA sixth film was planned as early as February 2010, prior to the production of ''Fast Five''; this was confirmed in April 2011, after Morgan began writing the screenplay, while the returns of Diesel, Moritz, and Lin were confirmed that June. Discussions arose filming [[Back-to-back film production|alongside]] a potential seventh installment; these were abandoned once [[principal photography]] began in July 2012, which lasted until that December, with filming locations including [[Los Angeles]], [[London]], [[Glasgow]], and the [[Canary Islands]]. Similarly to its predecessor, ''Fast & Furious 6'' featured mostly practical stuntwork, which required designed specialty vehicles in order to be completed.\n\n''Fast & Furious 6'' premiered at [[Empire, Leicester Square|Empire]] in [[Leicester Square]] on May 7, 2013, and was first theatrically released in the United Kingdom on May 17, and worldwide on May 24 in conventional and [[IMAX]] theaters, by [[Universal Pictures]]. The film received generally positive reviews from critics, with praise for Lin's direction, cast performances and action sequences. It grossed $788.7 million, making it the [[2013 in film#Highest-grossing films|sixth-highest-grossing film of 2013]], the then-fourth highest grossing film distributed by Universal, and the then-highest grossing film in the franchise. The sequel, ''[[Furious 7]]'', was released in the United States in April 2015.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- PER WP:FILMPLOT, PLOT SUMMARIES FOR FEATURE FILMS SHOULD BE BETWEEN 400 AND 700 WORDS. -->\nFollowing their successful heist in Brazil,{{refn|name=Timeline|group=N|As depicted in ''[[Fast Five]]'' (2011).}} [[Dom Toretto]] and his professional criminal crew have fled around the world and are living peacefully: Dom lives with Elena Neves; his sister Mia lives with [[Brian O'Conner]] and their son, Jack; [[Gisele Yashar]] and [[Han Lue]] are together; and Roman Pearce and Tej Parker live in luxury. Meanwhile, [[Diplomatic Security Service|DSS]] agents Luke Hobbs and Riley Hicks investigate the destruction of a Russian military convoy by a crew led by former British [[Special Air Service|SAS]] Major and special ops soldier Owen Shaw. Hobbs persuades Dom to help capture Shaw by showing him a photo of his supposedly murdered wife, Letty Ortiz. Dom and his crew accept the mission in exchange for their amnesty, allowing them to return to the United States.\n\nIn London, Shaw's hideout is found, but is revealed to be a distraction, while Shaw's crew performs a heist at an [[Interpol]] building. Shaw flees by a custom car, detonating his hideout and disabling most of the police, leaving Dom, Brian, Tej, Roman, Han, Gisele, Hobbs, and Riley to pursue him. Letty arrives to help Shaw, shooting Dom without hesitation before escaping. Back at their headquarters, Hobbs tells Dom's crew that Shaw is stealing components to create a \"Nightshade\" device that can shut down all power, intending to sell it to the highest bidder. Meanwhile, Shaw's investigation into Dom's crew reveals Letty's relationship with Dom, but she is revealed to be suffering from amnesia. Dominic's crew learns that Shaw is connected to Arturo Braga, a drug lord whom Dom and Brian imprisoned.{{refn|name=Timeline2|group=N|As depicted in ''[[Fast & Furious (2009 film)|Fast & Furious]]'' (2009).}} While Tej purchases several cars from an [[Auto auction|auction]] for the mission, Brian returns to Los Angeles as a prisoner to question Braga, who reveals that Shaw helped him build his drug cartel and says Letty survived the explosion that seemingly killed her; Shaw took her in after discovering her amnesia.\n\nWith [[FBI]] help, Brian is released from prison, regrouping with the team in London. Dom challenges Letty in a street racing competition; afterward, he returns her cross necklace. After Letty leaves, Shaw offers Dom a chance to walk away, threatening to otherwise hurt his family, but Dom refuses. Tej tracks Shaw's next attack to a Spanish [[NATO]] base. Shaw's crew assaults a highway military convoy carrying a computer chip to complete \"Nightshade\". Dom's crew interferes while Shaw, accompanied by Letty, commandeers a [[tank]], destroying cars en route. Brian and Roman flip the tank before it causes further damage, resulting in Letty being thrown from the vehicle as Dom saves her. Shaw and his crew are captured, but reveal Mia has been kidnapped by Shaw's henchmen Vegh and Klaus. Hobbs is forced to release Shaw, and Riley, revealed to be Shaw's covert accomplice, leaves with him; Letty chooses to remain with Dom.\n\nShaw's group board a moving [[Antonov An-124]] as Dom's crew gives chase. Dom, Letty, and Brian board the craft; Brian rescues Mia and escapes. The plane attempts to take-off but is held down by excess weight as the rest of the team tether the plane to their vehicles. Gisele sacrifices herself to save Han from Shaw's henchman, Adolfson.  Letty kills Riley and escapes with Hobbs to safety, but Dom pursues Shaw and the computer chip. As the plane crashes, Shaw is thrown and seriously injured, and Dom drives a [[Dodge Charger (LX/LD)|Charger]] out of the exploding plane. Dom reunites with his crew and gives the chip to Hobbs to secure their pardons. Dom and the others return to his old family home in Los Angeles. Hobbs and Elena, now working together, arrive to confirm the crew's freedom; Elena accepts that Dom loves Letty as the group prepares to say grace.\n\nIn a [[mid-credits scene]], Han is involved in a car chase when he is suddenly broadsided by an [[Mercedes-Benz W140|oncoming car]].{{refn|name=Timeline3|group=N|As depicted in ''[[The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift]]'' (2006).}} The driver walks away after leaving Letty's cross necklace by the crash, and calls Dom, saying: \"You don't know me, but you're about to\", as Han's car explodes.\n<!-- PER WP:FILMPLOT, PLOT SUMMARIES FOR FEATURE FILMS SHOULD BE BETWEEN 400 AND 700 WORDS. -->\n\n==Cast==\n{{Further|topic=the characters|List of Fast & Furious characters}}\n<!-- list as billed in film per [[WP:CASTLIST]] -->\n<!-- Listed one card each in opening credits -->\n* [[Vin Diesel]] as [[Dominic Toretto]], a former criminal, and professional street racer who has retired after their successful heist of $100 million with his crew in Brazil and is now staying with Elena.\n* [[Paul Walker]] as [[Brian O'Conner]], a former [[FBI]] agent turned criminal and professional street racer who has retired and settled down with his wife, Mia, and their son, Jack.\n* [[Dwayne Johnson]] as [[Luke Hobbs]], a loyal agent working for the Diplomatic Security Service (DSS) who allies with Dom following his last encounter with Dom and his team in [[Rio de Janeiro]].\n* [[Michelle Rodriguez]] as [[Letty Ortiz]], Dom's wife who has suffered from amnesia and was presumed dead in ''[[Fast & Furious (2009 film)|Fast & Furious]]'' (2009) following an undercover assignment as Brian's informant\n* [[Jordana Brewster]] as [[Mia Toretto]], Dom's sister, a former member of his team, and Brian's girlfriend and mother of his child.\n* [[Tyrese Gibson]] as [[Roman Pearce]], a former criminal from [[Barstow, California|Barstow]] and Brian's childhood friend, as well as a member of Dom's team.\n* [[Ludacris|Chris \"Ludacris\" Bridges]] as [[Tej Parker]], an ex-street racer and mechanic, as well as Brian and Roman's friend who was introduced in [[Miami]], also a member of Dom's team. \n* [[Sung Kang]] as [[Han Lue|Han Seoul-Oh]], pseudonym of Han Lue, a professional street racer and Dom's former business partner in the [[Dominican Republic]], also a member of his team.

Moritz said more:<ref name=\"ColliderSequel\"/>\n<blockquote>In Vin's and my mind we already know what the sixth movie is, we've already been talking about it. Vin and I have had numerous conversations about what that might be. And we're starting to get serious about it right now. We just finished [''Fast Five''] like 4 or 5 weeks ago and we just needed a break, and now we're gonna start focusing on that.</blockquote>\nIn April 2011 it was confirmed that Chris Morgan had already begun work on a script for a potential sixth film at the behest of Universal Studios.<ref name=\"DeadlineSequel\"/> It was also confirmed that Universal intended to transform the series from street-racing action into a series of heist films with car chases in the vein of ''[[The Italian Job]]'' (1969) and ''[[The French Connection (film)|The French Connection]]'' (1971), with ''Fast Five'' as the transitional movie.<ref name=\"DeadlineSequel\"/> Universal chairman Adam Fogelson said:<ref name=\"DeadlineSequel\"/>\n<blockquote>The question putting ''Fast Five'' and ''Fast Six'' together for us was: Can we take it out of being a pure car culture movie and into being a true action franchise in the spirit of those great heist films made 10 or 15 years ago</blockquote>\nFogelson said that the racing aspect had put a \"ceiling\" on the number of people willing to see films in the series, and that, by turning it into a series where car driving ability is just one aspect of the film, he hoped to increase the series' audience.<ref name=\"DeadlineSequel\"/> On Johnson's character, Fogelson added \"[Johnson] also wants to appear in and be integral to the action in ''Fast Six''.\"<ref name=\"DeadlineSequel\"/>\n\nOn June 24, 2011, Universal Pictures announced that the anticipated sequel was scheduled for release on May 24, 2013.<ref name=\"FastSixEarlyDate\"/> Moritz and Diesel returned as producers and Lin returned to direct.<ref name=\"FastSixEarlyDate\"/> In an interview with ''[[Boxoffice Pro|Boxoffice]]'', Lin revealed that he had, after discussions with Diesel, storyboarded, [[Previsualization|previsualized]] and edited a twelve-minute finale for ''Fast Six'' before filming was completed on ''Fast Five''. Lin said he shot the footage as he was unsure at the time if there would be a sequel or if he would be able to direct it, but he wanted to have input on how any sequel would end.<ref name=\"SequelBoxOffice\"/> On October 21, 2011, the ''Los Angeles Times'' reported that Universal was considering filming two sequels\u2014''Fast Six'' and ''[[Fast Seven]]'' (2015)\u2014[[Back-to-back film production|back to back]] with a single story running through both films; both written by Morgan and directed by Lin.<ref name=\"SequelLaTimes\"/> On December 20, 2011, Diesel stated that ''Fast Six'' would be split into two parts, with writing for the two films occurring simultaneously. On the decision, Diesel said:<ref name=\"SequelDec20\"/>\n<blockquote>We have to pay off this story, we have to service all of these character relationships, and when we started mapping all that out it just went beyond 110 pages&nbsp;...&nbsp;The studio said, 'You can't fit all that story in one damn movie!'<ref name=\"SequelDec20\"/></blockquote>\nOn April 23, 2012, it was announced that [[mixed martial arts]] fighter Gina Carano was in negotiations to play a member of Hobbs's team.<ref name=\"SequelApr2312\"/> On May 1, 2012, Michelle Rodriguez was confirmed to be reprising her role as Letty Ortiz,<ref name=\"SequelMay112\"/> and it was announced that Welsh actor Luke Evans had been offered a role as a villain.<ref name=\"SequeEvans\"/> Evans was confirmed to join the cast on May 9, 2012, portraying the leader of a heist gang.<ref name=\"SequelMay912\"/> On July 27, 2012, [[Joe Taslim]] was confirmed to appear as a villain, Jah.<ref name=\"SequelJuly2712\"/> On February 15, 2012, Johnson confirmed that ''Fast Six'' would begin filming in May 2012, with some of the production to take place in the United Kingdom and Germany. Johnson stated that the two intended sequels would no longer be filmed simultaneously because of weather issues in filming locations, and that production on ''Fast Seven'' would only begin after the completion of ''Fast Six''.<ref name=\"SequelFeb1512\"/> However, filming did not officially begin until July 30, 2012.<ref name=\"SequelFilming1\"/> In February 2013, it was confirmed that the film would be titled ''Fast & Furious 6''.<ref name=\"TitleFinal\"/>\n\n===Principal photography===\nFilming began on July 30, 2012, in London, England,<ref name=\"SequelFilming1\"/><ref name=\"FilmingLondon\"/><ref name=\"FilmingLondon2\"/> and [[Shepperton Studios]] in [[Surrey]].<ref name=\"FilmingEngland\"/> While ''Fast & Furious 6'' became only the third production to be allowed to film in [[Piccadilly Circus]] (a scene involving Diesel and Rodriguez drag racing), Lin was unable to obtain permission to shoot an elaborate action sequence there involving an exploding oil tanker, and so a replica of the landmark was built at Shepperton.<ref name=\"FilmingEngland2\"/><ref name=\"InterviewLinApr\"/> The production were given only two minutes every hour to shut down the area for filming.<ref name=\"FilmingMay813\"/> Stunt and car chase scenes began filming on location in [[Glasgow]], Scotland on August 29, 2012, and were scheduled to conclude on September 16, 2012. The shoot took place entirely at night and involved approximately 250 crew, but none of the central cast. Sets were built on site for the scenes including a large car showroom.<ref name=\"FilmGlasgow\"/><ref name=\"FilmGlasgow2\"/> Filming was scheduled to take place at the former Royal Air Force base [[RAF Bentwaters]] in late August 2012 until early September 2012.<ref name=\"FilmSuff\"/>\n\nShooting also occurred on Spain's [[Canary Islands]] including the island of [[Tenerife]] and [[Gran Canaria]]. Filming had been intended to take place in [[Marseille]], France, but was relocated to the islands to take advantage of a larger tax rebate (38%) that was estimated to lower filming costs by $20 million.<ref name=\"FilmingSpain\"/>\n\nOn October 11, 2012, Walker suffered an [[ACL injury]] during a stunt, forcing the production to film around his scenes until he recovered.<ref name=\"FilmingLon1011\"/> A scene involving a plane crash began filming at the former [[RAF]] station [[RAF Bovingdon]], [[Hertfordshire]] on October 30, 2012, and was scheduled to conclude on November 9.<ref name=\"FilmingEngNov3\"/> Filming for a car chase scene took place on [[Dale Street]] in [[Liverpool City Centre]], and also the [[Queensway Tunnel]] over four days in November 2012.<ref name=\"FilmingMay813\"/><ref name=\"FilmLiverpool\"/><ref name=\"FilmBirkenhead\"/> Two days of filming were spent at [[HM Treasury]]'s [[Government Offices Great George Street]], which served as a nightclub.<ref name=\"FilmingTreasury\"/>\n\nThe final phase of filming took place in [[Echo Park, Los Angeles]] beginning on December 1, 2012. The shoot returned the series to the filming location of the original ''[[The Fast and the Furious (2001 film)|The Fast and the Furious]]'' (2001), and required the garage setting of that film to be rebuilt by carpenters.<ref name=\"FilmLA\"/> By December 17, 2012, it was reported that filming had concluded.<ref name=\"FilmOver\"/> Post-production was heavily condensed; by March 2013, Lin was attempting to complete approximately 18 months' worth of post-production in a 12-week period. Lin was aided by five film editors, specialist teams focused on visual effects and color timing, and sound mixers that required two movie-theater-sized stages alone.<ref name=\"InterviewLinApr\"/>\n\n===Stunts===\nFor Owen Shaw's Flip Car, Lin tasked the film's vehicle designer with developing a car capable of driving head first into moving vehicles and flipping them into the air. McCarthy and his team designed a fully functional, low to the ground, [[formula racing]] car with a ramp on its front that allowed it to catapult other cars into the air while keeping the Flip Car driver safe.<ref name=\"StuntFlip1\"/><ref name=\"StuntFlip2\"/>\n\nFor Rodriguez's and Carano's fight in the London Underground, producers refused to let the pair attempt a stunt where their characters battle over a stair rail and fall down a stairwell, fearing a serious injury would derail filming; stunt women performed the practical stunt. Morgan's scripted rendition of the fight was described as a [[catfight]] on steroids, but Rodriguez provided input to turn it into more of a street fight. Rodriguez said: \"Originally in the script, it was a lot more '[[The Terminator|Terminator]]'-esque\u2014too far-fetched to be believed... Things just happened so quick and then I'm on top? Justin and I had to bust our booties to get it more realistic. I was like, 'This [woman] needs to kick my ass!'\" Rodriguez and Carano rehearsed their fight choreography over two months, with trained fighter Carano undergoing extra practice to ensure her strikes looked credible without hitting hard enough to harm Rodriguez.<ref name=\"StuntGirlfight\"/> Under the direction of fight choreographer Olivier Schneider, the fight was designed to be brutal but realistic, representing Carano's \"cop with fight training\" and Rodriguez's street fighting.<ref name=\"StuntGirlfight2\"/>\n\nThe parkade explosion Shaw lures Dom's team into combined on-set pillars that could be detonated alongside dust mines which could be used as a reference for the digital artists to create the appearance of the structure sinking into itself.<ref name=\"FX1\"/> A scene involving Evans' character commandeering a tank was originally intended to use CGI to portray the vehicle crushing cars along a Spanish highway, but the final scene used practical effects as the tank really ran over approximately 250 cars during filming.<ref name=\"InterviewLinApr\"/> The scene was shot over a three-mile stretch of highway in Tenerife lined with holiday resorts that had to be digitally removed to create a desolate appearance. The segment's finale that sees Roman leap to a nearby car and the tank flip was created digitally.<ref name=\"FX1\"/>\n\nThe scene featuring Diesel smashing his car through the nose of a Soviet-era cargo aircraft during takeoff was conceived by Lin while producing ''Fast & Furious'' in 2009. At the time, the stunt was too expensive to film and did not fit into that film's story, but Lin commissioned digital pre-visualization artists to develop a mock-up of the idea. He attempted to revive the concept for ''Fast Five'' but the technology available proved insufficient and it still did not organically fit into the story.<ref name=\"InterviewLinApr\"/> Filming the climactic scene practically was considered unfeasible as it involved throwing tanks through the air and having cars race alongside the moving aeroplane at 100 miles per hour. Lin opted to build various plane sets instead: a thirty foot high, seventy five foot long, fifty foot wide replica of the [[fuselage]] complete with wheels; the tail of the plane with a ramp allowing the cars to drive in and out; and a full scale build of the central fuselage, with wings, engines and the nose, that could be set on fire. For Dom's car to explode through the plane's nose, a Dodge Charger was placed on a pneumatic cannon mounted inside a ramp which was then towed by a 4\u00d74 truck, all concealed behind the plane's nose replica. This was then clad in material soaked in flammable materials. The cannon fired the Charger through the nose as the material is ignited for the practical effect. The stunt driver had a burning 40-ton plane rig chasing them down the runway afterwards. The scene involved more than 200 crew members, and over 350 visual effects (VFX) artists at VFX studio [[Double Negative (VFX)|Double Negative]] to complete.
