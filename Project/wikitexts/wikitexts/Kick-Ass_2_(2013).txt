It stars [[Aaron Taylor-Johnson]], [[Christopher Mintz-Plasse]], [[Chlo\u00eb Grace Moretz]], and [[Jim Carrey]], with the former trio reprising their roles from the first film. The film follows [[Kick-Ass (character)|Dave Lizewski / Kick-Ass]] (Taylor-Johnson), who joins a vigilante team called \"Justice Forever\", while [[Hit-Girl (character)|Mindy Macready / Hit Girl]] (Moretz) attempts to live a normal life, and Chris D'Amico (Mintz-Plasse) taking up the mantle of The Motherfucker and forming a supervillain team to take revenge on Kick-Ass.\n\n''Kick-Ass 2'' was released on 14 August 2013 in the United Kingdom, 16 August in the United States, and 24 February 2014 in Japan by [[Universal Pictures]], [[United International Pictures]], and [[Toho|Toho-Towa]], respectively. The film earned $60.8 million on a $30 million budget. It received mixed reviews from critics, with many deeming it inferior to the first film.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- PER WP:FILMPLOT, PLOT SUMMARIES FOR FEATURE-LENGTH FILMS SHOULD BE BETWEEN 400 AND 700 WORDS! -->\n[[Kick-Ass (film)|Four years after the death of Damon Macready and defeating Frank D'Amico]], [[Kick-Ass (character)|Dave Lizewski]], bored after having retired from fighting crime as Kick-Ass, begins training with Hit-Girl [[Hit-Girl (character)|(Mindy Macready)]] to become a real hero. Following the death of his father, Chris D'Amico accidentally kills his own mother by kicking her tanning bed, causing it to short-circuit. Now in control of his father's criminal empire, Chris decides to become a supervillain named The Motherfucker, adapting a [[BDSM]] suit for his costume, and assembles a gang of supervillains called the Toxic Mega Cunts with his aide Javier and gains a cult following on [[Twitter]], swearing vengeance on Kick-Ass. The other leading members of the Toxic Mega Cunts include African-American [[UFC]] fighter Black Death, short-stature mob enforcer The Tumor, ex-Triad gang member Genghis Carnage, and the only woman on the team, former Russian bodyguard Mother Russia.\n\nMindy's guardian, Marcus, discovers she is still fighting crime and makes her promise to give it up. Dave resumes his life as Kick-Ass, joining the superhero team Justice Forever (which Dave had inspired), led by ex-mafia member and [[Born again (Christianity)|born-again Christian]], Colonel Stars and Stripes. Kick-Ass begins a sexual relationship with Night Bitch, one of the members (after breaking up with his girlfriend Katie Deauxma due to her mistakenly believing him to have been cheating on her with Mindy). He and Marty, who is also on the team as Battle Guy, alienate their friend Todd from participating in their heroics because Todd's superhero persona \"Ass-Kicker\" is an obvious knockoff of Kick-Ass. Mindy, attempting to lead a normal life, tries out for the dance team at school, and promptly asks a boy to take her on a date after declining to join Justice Forever. The date ends up as a cruel prank planned by bullies in her school, but Mindy gets her revenge the next day, resulting in her suspension from school and her grounding by Marcus when he finds out.\n\nDave's father discovers Dave is Kick-Ass after finding his superhero costume, and they have an argument which leads Dave to leave home. After his imprisoned uncle has Javier killed, a now-deranged Chris kills Colonel Stars and Stripes, and attempts to rape Night Bitch the following day, but fails due to impotence and has her beaten up instead. Chris's henchwoman Mother Russia kills the arriving authorities, resulting in a police clampdown on both costumed villains and vigilantes. When the police track Dave through his [[IP address]], Dave's father surrenders, claiming that he is Kick-Ass, in Dave's place. Chris, tipped off by Todd, who has joined the Toxic Mega Cunts unaware that they are psychopaths, has Mr. Lizewski murdered in police custody, revealing his true identity.\n\nThe Toxic Mega Cunts sabotage Mr. Lizewski's funeral and kidnap Dave, but Mindy rescues him. Afterwards, Dave, Mindy and the remaining members of Justice Forever, joined by a resurgence of masked do-gooders, battle and defeat the outnumbered Toxic Mega Cunts. Mindy, as Hit-Girl, defeats and kills Mother Russia with the help of an adrenaline dose in battle, while Dave and Chris fight on a rooftop. Chris crashes through a skylight, landing in a water tank where he is mauled by a shark.\n\nJustice Forever decides to take a break from its superhero duties, helping people in their ordinary lives instead. Mindy tells Dave that she is leaving New York due to being wanted for murder, but that the citizens need Kick-Ass. As police officers raid Marcus's home to investigate Mindy's whereabouts, Dave accepts the responsibility and begins training and upgrading his equipment.\n\nIn a [[post-credits scene]], Chris, who has survived the shark attack, and whose limbs and genitals were bitten off by the shark, complains for attention over an out of reach cup of water.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Aaron Taylor-Johnson]] as [[Kick-Ass (character)|Dave Lizewski / Kick-Ass]]\n* [[Christopher Mintz-Plasse]] as Chris D'Amico / The Motherfucker\n* [[Chlo\u00eb Grace Moretz]] as [[Hit-Girl|Mindy Macready / Hit-Girl]]\n* [[Clark Duke]] as Marty / Battle-Guy\n* [[Morris Chestnut]] as Detective Marcus Williams\n* [[Jim Carrey]] as Sal Bertolinni / Colonel Stars and Stripes\n* [[Donald Faison]] as Samuel Keers / Doctor Gravity\n* [[John Leguizamo]] as Javier\n* [[Augustus Prew]] as Todd / Ass-Kicker\n* [[Garrett M.
