The screenplay by Ethel Hill and Walter Ferris is loosely based on the 1905 novel ''[[A Little Princess]]'' by [[Frances Hodgson Burnett]]. The film was the first [[Shirley Temple]] movie to be filmed completely in [[Technicolor]].<ref name=\"variety\"/> It was also her last major success as a child star.<ref name=\"tcmarticle\"/>\n\nAlthough it maintained the novel's Victorian London setting, the film introduced several new characters and storylines and used the [[Second Boer War]] and the [[siege of Mafeking]] as a backdrop to the action. Temple and [[Arthur Treacher]] had a musical number together, performing the song \"[[Knocked 'Em in the Old Kent Road]]\". Temple also appeared in an extended ballet sequence. The film's ending was drastically different from the book.\n\nIn 1968, the film entered the [[List of films in the public domain in the United States|public domain in the United States]] because the claimants did not renew its [[copyright registration]] in the 28th year after publication.<ref>{{cite journal |first=David |last=Pierce |date=June 2007 |title=Forgotten Faces: Why Some of Our Cinema Heritage Is Part of the Public Domain  |journal=Film History: An International Journal |volume=19 |issue=2 |pages=125\u201343 |issn=0892-2160 |oclc=15122313 |jstor=25165419 |doi=10.2979/FIL.2007.19.2.125 |s2cid=191633078 }}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n[[File:The Little Princess (1939).webm|thumb|thumbtime=44|upright=1.2|''The Little Princess'' (full film)]]\nCaptain Crewe, called to fight in the [[Second Boer War]], has to leave his daughter Sara ([[Shirley Temple]]) with her pony at Miss Minchin's School for Girls. With all the money Captain Crewe can offer, Miss Minchin gives Sara a fancy, private room.\n\nAlthough worried about her father, Sara is distracted by riding lessons. It is during these riding lessons that Sara helps contrive meetings between Miss Rose, her teacher, and Mr. Geoffrey, the riding instructor, who is also the grandson of the mean-spirited next door neighbor, Lord Wickham. Mr. Geoffrey decides to volunteer to fight in the war and asks Miss Rose to marry him before leaving. Sara has him to tea before he ships out, using the excuse to convince Miss Minchin, but she catches Geoffrey and Rose together, not allowing them to say a proper goodbye. Sara later hears news that [[Mafeking, South Africa|Mafeking]] is free and expects her father will soon come home. Miss Minchin throws Sara a lavish birthday party on the request of her father. During the party, Captain Crewe's solicitor arrives with the sad news that Captain Crewe has died and his real estate, the basis for his wealth, has been confiscated. Miss Minchin ends Sara's party abruptly. Without her father's financial support, Sara becomes a servant, now working at the school she used to attend. Sara gains new solace in a friendship with Ram Dass, Lord Wickham's servant.  She also receives support from Miss Minchin's brother Bertie, who does not agree with her treatment. Miss Minchin confiscates a letter from Mr. Geoffrey to Rose and fires her. She intervenes with Geoffrey's grandfather who vows to never speak to him again. \n\nIn her new role, Sara gets hungrier and more tired from her arduous duties and sneaks off to veterans' hospitals, convinced her father is not dead. After a string of episodes, including a performance of the film's most well-known song \"[[Wot Cher! Knocked 'em in the Old Kent Road|Knocked 'em in the Old Kent Road]]\" with Bertie, Sara is at her wits end. Things start to worsen, when Sara gets into an argument with Miss Minchin, who cannot tolerate her faith in believing her father is still alive and tries forcing her to face reality. She is taunted by Lavinia the next day, eventually causing her to lose her temper and dump ashes on her. Miss Minchin arrives in the attic to punish Sara for \"hurting\" Lavinia. She discovers blankets, food and other items that Ram Dass and Lord Wickham left Sara, assumes they are stolen, and locks her in the attic, calling the police. Sara escapes and runs to the hospital with Minchin in hot pursuit.\n\nMeanwhile, the hospital is preparing to transfer a newly arrived unknown patient, who is unable to communicate except to repeatedly say, \"Sara, Sara\"; it is Captain Crewe. Sara bursts in upon a visit by Queen Victoria, who grants her permission to search for her father. During her search, she is reunited with a wounded Mr. Geoffrey and Miss Rose. Hiding from Miss Minchin and the police, she happens upon her father in the waiting room. Initially he doesn't respond to her but her cries bring him out of his stupor. \n\nA staff member announces Sara has found her father, and Miss Minchin exclaims: \"Captain Crewe is alive?!\" to which her brother retorts, \"Of course he's alive! How could she find him if he wasn't alive?\" The film ends with Sara helping her father stand as the Queen departs, smiling at Sara on the way out.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Shirley Temple]] as Sara Crewe\n* [[Richard Greene]] as Geoffrey Hamilton\n* [[Anita Louise]] as Rose\n* [[Ian Hunter (actor)|Ian Hunter]] as Captain Reginald Crewe\n* [[Cesar Romero]] as Ram Dass\n* [[Arthur Treacher]] as Hubert \"Bertie\" Minchin\n* [[Mary Nash (actress)|Mary Nash]] as Mistress Amanda Minchin\n* [[Sybil Jason]] as Becky\n* [[Miles Mander]] as Lord Wickham\n* [[Marcia Mae Jones]] as Lavinia\n* Deidre Gale as Jessie\n* Ira Stevens as Ermengarde\n* [[E.

This made the movie the most expensive Shirley Temple film to date.<ref name=\"temp\"/>\n\nAs part of the preparation for the movie, great pains were taken to make sure every aspect of it was true to 1899 and England, the time period and setting of the story. Props such as the doll had to be to the exact specifications of a doll made at that time. Clothing also had to be precise. Production was held up after it was discovered that one of the costumes Temple wore used snap fasteners that were not invented until 1908.<ref>{{cite book| first=Shirley Temple| last=Black| title=Child Star: An Autobiography| location=New York| publisher=McGraw-Hill| year=1988| pages=252\u2013253| url=https://archive.org/details/childstarautobio0000temp_d1g5/page/252/mode/2up?q=snap+fasteners| isbn=978-0-0700-5532-2| url-access=registration| access-date=February 13, 2022}}</ref>\n\nDuring the scene where Temple dumps ashes on Marcia Mae Jones' character, the original plan was to do it in one take. Temple, however, who was angry about the attention received by Sybil Jason in a previous scene, wanted to repeat it after the first take, likely just to \"let off steam,\" but when she asked Director Lang for a second ash-dump take, he said it was not necessary.{{sfn|Black|1988|p=[https://archive.org/details/childstarautobio0000temp_d1g5/page/254/mode/2up?q=dusty+coal 255]}}\n\nFor the ballet dance scene, Temple was trained by ballet dance instructor Ernest Belcher. Temple rented her pony Spunky to the studio to simply lie down in the stall. The artificial green coloration of the straw (which was green so it would show better In Technicolor) however caused the pony to become restless and resulted in him being removed and Temple losing his appearance fee.<ref>Black 1988, [https://archive.org/details/childstarautobio0000temp_d1g5/page/260/mode/2up?q=monkey 257-258,260]. <small font>Note \u2014 Black also states that in filming a scene where she was to pick up a small monkey belonging to Cesar Romero's character, the monkey was startled and bit her, causing her to require a tetanus shot. Black's recollection is mistaken: the monkey scene was in her earlier film, [[Heidi (1937 film)|''Heidi'']]. Romero's character in ''Little Princess'' had a colorful pet bird, a [[macaw]], not a monkey. Both films had some of the same actors, likely explaining the mistaken memory.</small font></ref>\n\nAs a way of fitting in with the rest of the crew, Temple wanted to have her own punch card for punching in and out of work for the day and was initially rebuffed. The director Lang eventually relented and gave her a card to use. IBM caught word of Temple's enthusiasm and provided a special custom-made punch card recorder embossed with her name along with punch cards with her photo on them. The machine sat unused while Temple continued using the regular machine. Her time cards were likewise ignored by the studio payroll person.{{sfn|Black|1988|p=254}}\n\n==Reception==\nAccording to ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'', \"Transposition of the Frances Hodgson Burnett several-generation favorite, Sara Crewe, is accomplished most successfully. The fairy-tale story is still [[saccharine]] to the nth degree, but once the basic premise is established, it rolls along acceptably. And, while the story has been changed for screen purposes, the general line is close enough.\"<ref name=\"variety\"/>\n\nBenjamin R. Crisler, who reviewed the film when it opened in New York City at [[Roxy Theatre (New York City)|Roxy Theatre]], said\n<blockquote>\"With any other child on earth, it is amazing to reflect, ''The Little Princess'' would stand out as one of the most glaring exhibits of pure [[wikt:hokum|hokum]] in screen history; with Mistress Temple, it may very well be, as Mr. Zanuck unflinchingly proclaims, the greatest picture with which Mr. Zanuck has ever been associated.\"</blockquote>\n\n[[Janet Maslin]], writing for ''[[The New York Times]]'' 44 years later, on the occasion of its [[VHS]] release by [[Media Home Entertainment]], called it \"antiquated enough to seem charming\" and concludes \"[t]he movie's music, its corny but likable [[wikt:histrionic|histrionic]]s and its rousing patriotism (it was made in 1939) culminate in a happy ending sure to make even grown-up viewers cry.\"<ref name=\"nyt1983\"/>\n\n==References==\n'''Notes'''\n{{Reflist|refs=\n<ref name=\"variety\">{{cite news| title=The Little Princess |url=https://www.variety.com/review/VE1117792650/| date=December 31, 1938| newspaper=Variety | access-date=2022-02-13}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"tcmarticle\">{{cite web |title=The Little Princess |url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/3959/The-Little-Princess/articles.html |first=Margarita |last=Landazuri |website=Turner Classic Movies |access-date=2012-07-30}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"nyt1939\">{{cite news |title=James Cagney Rides the Plains in ''Oklahoma Kid'' at the Strand \u2014 Shirley Temple Film at the Roxy |url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9904E4D71E3FE23ABC4952DFB5668382629EDE <!-- | archive-url= http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/f-chat/2204109/posts |archive-date=2009-03-11 -->| first= Benjamin R. |last=Crisler |date=March 11, 1939| newspaper=The New York Times |access-date=2012-07-30}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"nyt1983\">{{cite web| title= The Little Princess |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1983/11/13/arts/the-little-princess.html |first= Janet |last= Maslin |date= November 13, 1983 |newspaper=The New York Times |access-date=2012-07-30 }}</ref>\n}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|The Little Princess (1939 film)}}\n* {{IMDb title|id=0031580|title=The Little Princess}}\n* {{Internet Archive film|id=little_princess|name=The Little Princess}}\n* {{Amg movie|29595|The Little Princess}}\n* {{tcmdb title|id=3959|title=The Little Princess}}\n* {{AFI film|id=4170|title=The Little Princess}}\n* [http://www.watchconlines.com/2018/08/the-little-princess-1939.html Watch The Little Princess (1939)]\n\n{{A Little Princess}}\n{{Walter Lang}}\n{{Darryl F.
