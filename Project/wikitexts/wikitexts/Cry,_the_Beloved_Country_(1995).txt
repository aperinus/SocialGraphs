It stars [[James Earl Jones]] and [[Richard Harris]].\n\nThe film was made in 1995, shortly after the fall of [[apartheid]] and the free election of [[Nelson Mandela]] as President of South Africa.\n\n==Synopsis==\nSet in South Africa in October 1946, before the official implementation of [[apartheid]], this is the story of church minister Stephen Kumalo (James Earl Jones) who is requested from his village to [[Johannesburg]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0112749/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl |title=Cry, the Beloved Country summary |website=[[Imdb.com]] |access-date=2 July 2016}}</ref> There he discovers that his son Absalom has been arrested for the murder of a white man. Simultaneously, the white man's father, James Jarvis (Richard Harris), supports apartheid. When Stephen And James meet, they eventually come to unexpected understandings about their sons and their own shared humanity.\n\n==Selected cast==\n{{cast listing|\n*[[James Earl Jones]] as Rev.

It has been described by film score reviewer Christian Clemmensen of ''[[Filmtracks.com]]'' as \"one of Barry's last truly enjoyable efforts.\"<ref name=\"Filmtracks\" >{{cite web |first=Christian |last=Clemmensen |title=''Cry, the Beloved Country'' soundtrack review |orig-year=24 September 1996|date=25 August 2008 |url=http://www.filmtracks.com/titles/cry_beloved.html |publisher=[[Filmtracks.com]] |access-date=29 December 2013}}</ref> Barry, who had previously composed music for such African themed films as ''[[Zulu (1964 film)|Zulu]]'' (1964), ''[[Born Free]]'' (1966), and ''[[Out of Africa (film)|Out of Africa]]'' (1985), used predominantly western musical styles to complete the score. The music is notable for referencing themes from Barry's previous work on ''Zulu'', augmenting the original warlike compositions into a somber piano theme for travel scenes.<ref name=\"Filmtracks\" /><ref name=\"New York Times\" /> The film also features the song \"[[Exile (Enya song)|Exile]]\" by [[Enya]].\n\nThe music was performed by the [[English Chamber Orchestra]] and recorded in Studio One at the [[EMI]] [[Abbey Road Studios]], London.\n\n==Filming==\n\nThe film was shot on location in [[KwaZulu-Natal|KwaZulu Natal]], [[Cape Province]], and at [[Gauteng]], South Africa.\n\n==Reception==\n''Cry, the Beloved Country'' received a mostly positive response from critics and holds an 85% \"Fresh\" rating from the review aggregator [[Rotten Tomatoes]].<ref name=\"Rotten Tomatoes\">{{cite web |url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1068781-cry_the_beloved_country |title=Cry, the Beloved Country |access-date=29 December 2013 |work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]}}</ref>\n\nOnline critic [[James Berardinelli]] gave the film four out of four stars, and described the performances of Harris and Jones as \"superb,\" concluding \"Rarely does a motion picture touch the heart so deeply, with no hint of artifice or manipulation.\"<ref>{{cite web | last =Berardinelli | first =James | author-link=James Berardinelli | title =Cry, the Beloved Country  | work =ReelViews | url =http://preview.reelviews.net/movies/c/cry_beloved.html | access-date =29 December 2013}}</ref> [[Stephen Holden]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' also wrote favorably of the film, commenting \"In a moment as transcendent as it is risky, the screen erupts with a volcanic emotion that cuts through the prevailing high-minded contemplation. Why risky? Because movies have become so invested in the unleashing of violent emotion and the escalation of hostility, that expressions of restraint, reconciliation and forgiveness can easily be read as corny cop-outs. ''Cry, the Beloved Country'' is not corny, and it doesn't cop out.\"<ref name=\"New York Times\" >{{cite web | last =Holden | first =Stephen | title =Cry, the Beloved Country  | work =[[The New York Times]] | date =15 December 1995 | url =https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9806E0DD1739F936A25751C1A963958260 | access-date =29 December 2013}}</ref>\n\nConversely, [[Roger Ebert]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' had a less positive view of the film, giving it only two and half out of four stars, and commenting, \"The film has genuine qualities. Its photography and tone evoke a South Africa that is indeed beloved by its inhabitants ('If the climate and the landscape were not so beautiful, we would have had a revolution 50 years ago,' Paton is said to have observed). The performances by Jones and Harris have a quiet dignity, suitable to the characters if not reflecting a larger reality. But the film contains little that would have concerned the South African censors under apartheid. [...] ''Cry, the Beloved Country'' reflects a sentimentality that motivates many people, but it fails as a portrait of what it used to be like in South Africa, what happened and what it's like now.\"<ref>{{cite web | last =Ebert | first =Roger | author-link=Roger Ebert | title =Cry, the Beloved Country  | work =[[Chicago Sun-Times]] | date = 20 December 1995  | url =http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/cry-the-beloved-country-1995 | access-date =29 December 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Awards and nominations==\n\n*[[NAACP Image Awards]]\n**Outstanding Motion Picture (Nominated)\n**Outstanding Actor in a Motion Picture: James Earl Jones (Nominated)\n**Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Motion Picture: Charles S.
