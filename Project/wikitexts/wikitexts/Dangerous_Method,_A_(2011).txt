The film stars [[Keira Knightley]], [[Viggo Mortensen]], [[Michael Fassbender]], [[Sarah Gadon]], and [[Vincent Cassel]]. Its screenplay was adapted by writer [[Christopher Hampton]] from his 2002 stage play ''The Talking Cure'', which was based on the 1993 non-fiction book by [[John Kerr (author)|John Kerr]], ''A Most Dangerous Method: The Story of Jung, Freud, and Sabina Spielrein''.\n\nSet on the eve of [[World War I]], ''A Dangerous Method'' describes the turbulent relationships between [[Carl Jung]], founder of [[analytical psychology]]; [[Sigmund Freud]], founder of the discipline of [[psychoanalysis]]; and [[Sabina Spielrein]], initially a patient of Jung and later a physician and one of the first female psychoanalysts.<ref>Kerr, John. 1993. A Most Dangerous Method: The Story of Jung, Freud, and Sabina Spielrein, New York: Alfred A Knopf, 1993, p. 11.</ref>\n\nA co-production between British, Canadian and German production companies, the film marks the third consecutive collaboration between Cronenberg and Viggo Mortensen (after ''[[A History of Violence (film)|A History of Violence]]'' and ''[[Eastern Promises]]''). This is also the third Cronenberg film made with British film producer [[Jeremy Thomas]], after completing together the [[William Burroughs]] adaptation ''[[Naked Lunch (film)|Naked Lunch]]'' and the [[J. G. Ballard]] adaptation ''[[Crash (1996 film)|Crash]]''. Filming took place between May and July 2010 in [[Cologne]] on a soundstage, with exterior shots filmed in [[Vienna]].\n\n''A Dangerous Method'' premiered at the [[Venice Film Festival|68th Venice Film Festival]] and was also featured at the [[2011 Toronto International Film Festival]].<ref>{{cite news |title=TIFF 2011: U2, Brad Pitt, George Clooney Films Featured At 2011 Toronto International Film Festival |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2011/07/26/tiff-brad-pitt-2011-george-clooney-u2_n_909633.html#s316195&title=U2 |access-date=25 August 2011 |newspaper=Huffington Post|date=26 July 2011}}</ref><ref name=Evans2011>{{Citation|title = A Dangerous Method TIFF premiere photos| url = http://www.digitalhit.com/galleries/40/585/| year = 2011| author = Evans, Ian| website = DigitalHit.com| access-date = 2012-03-12 }}</ref> The film was theatrically released in Germany on 10 November 2011 by [[Universal Pictures International]], in Canada on 13 January 2012 by [[Entertainment One]] and in the United Kingdom on 10 February 2012 by [[Lionsgate UK|Lionsgate]]. The film grossed $24 million worldwide and received positive reviews from critics, many praising the performances of Mortensen and Fassbender and Cronenberg's direction. It appeared on several critics' year-end lists. At the [[70th Golden Globe Awards]], Mortensen was nominated for the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor \u2013 Motion Picture|Best Supporting Actor \u2013 Motion Picture]] for his portrayal of Freud.\n\n==Plot==\nIn August 1904, [[Sabina Spielrein]] arrives at the [[Burgh\u00f6lzli]], the pre-eminent psychiatric hospital in [[Z\u00fcrich]], suffering from [[hysteria]] and begins a new course of treatment with the young Swiss doctor [[Carl Jung]]. He uses [[word association]] and [[dream interpretation]] as part of his approach to psychoanalysis, and finds that Spielrein's condition was triggered by the humiliation and sexual arousal she felt as a child when her father spanked her naked.\n\nJung and chief of medicine [[Eugen Bleuler]] recognize Spielrein's intelligence and energy, and allow her to assist them in their experiments. She measures the physical reactions of subjects during word association, to provide [[empirical data]] as a scientific basis for psychoanalysis. She soon learns that much of this new science is founded on the doctors' observations of themselves, each other, and their families, not just their patients. The doctors, Jung and Freud, correspond at length before they meet, and begin sharing their dreams and analysing each other, and Freud himself soon adopts Jung as his heir and agent.\n\nJung finds in Spielrein a kindred spirit, and their attraction deepens due to [[transference]]. Jung resists the idea of cheating on his wife, [[Emma Jung|Emma]], and breaking the [[taboo]] of sex with a patient, but his resolve is weakened by the wild and unrepentant confidences of his new patient [[Otto Gross]], a brilliant, philandering, unstable psychoanalyst. Gross decries monogamy in general and suggests that resistance to transference is symptomatic of the repression of normal, healthy sexual impulses, exhorting Jung to indulge himself with abandon.\n\nJung finally begins an affair with Spielrein, including rudimentary [[Bondage (BDSM)|bondage]] and spanking. Things become even more tangled as he becomes her advisor to her dissertation; he publishes not only his studies of her as a patient but eventually her treatise as well. Spielrein wants to conceive a child with Jung, but he refuses. After his attempt to confine their relationship again to doctor and patient, she appeals to Freud for his professional help, and forces Jung to tell Freud the truth about their relationship, reminding him that she could have publicly damaged him but did not want to.\n\nJung and Freud journey to America. However, cracks appear in their friendship as they begin to disagree more frequently on matters of psychoanalysis. Jung and Spielrein meet to work on her dissertation in Switzerland, and begin their sexual relationship once more. However, after Jung refuses to leave his wife for her, Spielrein decides to go to Vienna. She meets Freud, and says that although she sides with him, she believes he and Jung need to reconcile for psychoanalysis to continue to develop.\n\nFollowing Freud's collapse at an academic conference, he and Jung continue correspondence via letters. They decide to end their relationship after increasing hostilities and accusations regarding the differences in their conceptualisation of psychoanalysis. Spielrein marries a Russian doctor and, while pregnant, visits Jung and his wife. They discuss psychoanalysis and Jung's new mistress. Jung confides that his love for Spielrein made him a better person.\n\nThe film's footnote reveals the eventual fates of the four analysts. Gross starved to death in Berlin in 1920. Freud died of cancer in London in 1939 after being driven out of Vienna by the [[Nazi]]s. Spielrein trained a number of analysts in the [[Soviet Union]], before she and her two daughters were shot by the Nazis in 1942. Jung emerged from a [[nervous breakdown]] to become the world's leading psychologist before dying in 1961.<ref>Zwei der im Abspann genannten Daten sind falsch: Otto Gross starb 1920, Sabina Spielrein 1942.</ref>\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Keira Knightley]] as [[Sabina Spielrein]]\n* [[Michael Fassbender]] as [[Carl Gustav Jung]]\n* [[Viggo Mortensen]] as [[Sigmund Freud]]\n* [[Vincent Cassel]] as [[Otto Gross]]\n* [[Sarah Gadon]] as [[Emma Jung]]\n* [[Andr\u00e9 Hennicke]] as [[Eugen Bleuler]]\n* [[:de:Arndt Schwering-Sohnrey|Arndt Schwering-Sohnrey]] as [[S\u00e1ndor Ferenczi]]\n}}\n\n==Production==\nHampton's earliest version of the screenplay, dating back to the 1990s, was written for [[Julia Roberts]] in the role of Sabina Spielrein, but the film was never realized.
