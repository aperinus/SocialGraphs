The man reveals that he can transform into a [[Japanese wolf|wolf]], and they later have two wolf/human children: A daughter named Yuki, and a son named Ame. Soon after, their father is killed in an accident while hunting food for the children.\n\nHana's life as a single mother is difficult; Yuki and Ame constantly switch between their human and wolf forms, get into fights, and Hana has to hide them from the world. After she receives noise complaints and a visit from social workers concerned that the children have not had vaccinations, Hana moves the family to the countryside away from prying neighbors. She works hard to repair a dilapidated house, but struggles to sustain the family on their own crops. With help from a strict old man named Nirasaki, she learns to farm sufficiently and becomes friends with some of the locals.\n\nOne winter day, Ame almost drowns in a river after trying to hunt a [[kingfisher]], but Yuki rescues him, and Ame becomes more confident in his wolf abilities. Yuki begs her mother to let her go to school like other children. Hana accepts on the condition that Yuki keeps her wolf nature secret. Yuki soon makes friends at school. Meanwhile, Ame is more interested in the forest and takes lessons from an elderly fox about survival in the wild.\n\nIn fourth grade, Yuki's class receives a new transfer student, S\u014dhei, who realizes something is strange about her. When he pursues the matter by cornering her, Yuki gets angry, transforms into a wolf, and inadvertently injures him, leaving a scar on his right ear. At the meeting with their parents and teachers, S\u014dhei tells them a wolf attacked him, absolving Yuki of the blame. The two become friends.\n\nYuki and Ame fight over whether they are human or wolf, especially after Yuki forces Ame to start going back to school, to which he refuses. Two years later, a fierce storm gathers and Yuki's school is let out early. As Hana is about to leave to pick her up, Ame disappears into the forest to help his dying fox teacher, so she follows him. The other children are picked up by their parents, leaving Yuki and S\u014dhei alone. Yuki shows S\u014dhei that she can transform into a wolf and it was really her who attacked him. He tells her he already knew, and promises to keep her secret.\n\nAs Hana searches for Ame, she slips and falls off a cliff. She sees a vision of the children's father, who tells her that Yuki and Ame will find their own paths in life, and that she raised them well. Ame finds Hana and carries her to safety. She awakens to see Ame fully transform into an adult wolf and run into the mountains. Realizing he has found his own path, she happily but tearfully accepts his goodbye.\n\nOne year later, Yuki leaves home to move into a middle school dormitory. Ame's wolf howls are heard far and wide in the forest. Hana, now living alone, reflects that raising her wolf children was like a fairy tale, and feels proud to have raised them well.\n\n==Voice cast==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! rowspan=2|Character\n! colspan=2|Cast\n|-\n!

Anime!'' in February 2013, Hosoda explained why he chose the setting of ''Wolf Children'' despite the fact that it is a story about raising a child: \"It is generally taken for granted that children are raised and then grow up. But for the actual people involved, it is not natural at all. In order for the audience to share this feeling, I thought it would be good if we all shared an experience that no one else had (raising a werewolf child).\"<ref>[https://animeanime.jp/article/2013/02/15/13015.html \u6620\u753b\u300e\u304a\u304a\u304b\u307f\u3053\u3069\u3082\u306e\u96e8\u3068\u96ea\u300f\u7d30\u7530\u5b88\uff08\u76e3\u7763\u30fb\u811a\u672c\u30fb\u539f\u4f5c\uff09\u30a4\u30f3\u30bf\u30d3\u30e5\u30fc \u524d\u7de8\uff08\u30a2\u30cb\u30e1\uff01\u30a2\u30cb\u30e1\uff01\uff09]</ref>\n\nIn an interview with ''[[Famitsu]]'', Hosoda said, \"I used to take it for granted that people would have children. However, after getting married, I began to realize that raising children in the city is a hardship in terms of the environment, such as public support, and that living in the countryside is not necessarily easy, and that there is a hardship of not having anyone of the same age. I wanted to make a film about such endurance.\" Human parenting cannot be done in complete isolation, and the reason for choosing wolves as the material for the project was that \"wolves are very family-oriented, and they are disciplined animals that have a leader who leads the pack and lives with the whole group in mind.\"<ref>[https://www.famitsu.com/news/201207/06017604.html \u7d30\u7530\u5b88\u76e3\u7763\u6700\u65b0\u4f5c\u300e\u304a\u304a\u304b\u307f\u3053\u3069\u3082\u306e\u96e8\u3068\u96ea\u300f\u76e3\u7763\u76f4\u6483\u30a4\u30f3\u30bf\u30d3\u30e5\u30fc\uff08\u30d5\u30a1\u30df\u901a.com\uff09]</ref>\n\nThe setting of the early part of the story, \"a national university on the outskirts of Tokyo,\" is modeled after [[Hitotsubashi University]] in [[Kunitachi, Tokyo]].<ref>{{Cite web|url= http://www.vis-kunitachi.jp/loketi/48222/ |title= \u3010\u516c\u958b\u4e2d\uff01\u3011\u6620\u753b\u300c\u304a\u304a\u304b\u307f\u3053\u3069\u3082\u306e\u96e8\u3068\u96ea\u300d\u3010\u56fd\u7acb\u3082\u821e\u53f0\u306e\u30e2\u30c7\u30eb\u306b\u3011 |website= \u30d3\u30b8\u30c6\uff01\u56fd\u7acb\u2015\u56fd\u7acb\u5e02\u306e\u5730\u57df\u30d7\u30ed\u30e2\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u30b5\u30a4\u30c8 |access-date= 2019-09-07 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20120824025723/http://www.vis-kunitachi.jp/loketi/48222/ |archive-date= 2012-08-24 |url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url= https://happyspot.jp/blog/ex-index.aspx?day=20120722&happyspotid=kunitachi&tempid=kunitachihappyspot |title= \u6620\u753b\u300c\u304a\u304a\u304b\u307f\u3053\u3069\u3082\u306e\u96e8\u3068\u96ea\u300d \u4e00\u6a4b\u5927\u5b66\u7de8 |website=\u56fd\u7acb\u30cf\u30c3\u30d4\u30fc\u30b9\u30dd\u30c3\u30c8 |date= 2012-07-22 |access-date= 2019-09-07 }}</ref> In addition, the countryside where Hana moves to is modeled after the undeveloped woodland in [[Toyama Prefecture]].
