The story involves a woman who hires a notorious gunman to protect her father's ranch, and later to avenge his murder, only to find that the gunman is not what she expected. The supporting cast features [[Tom Nardini]], [[Michael Callan]], [[Dwayne Hickman]], and [[Nat King Cole]] and [[Stubby Kaye]], who together perform the film's theme song, and who appear throughout the film in the form of travelling [[minstrel]]s or [[troubadour]]s as a kind of musical [[Greek chorus]] and [[framing device]].\n\nThe film was directed by [[Elliot Silverstein]] from a [[screenplay]] by [[Walter Newman (screenwriter)|Walter Newman]] and [[Frank Pierson]] adapted from the 1956 novel ''The Ballad of Cat Ballou'' by [[Roy Chanslor]], who also wrote the novel filmed as ''[[Johnny Guitar]]''. Chanslor's novel was a serious Western, and though it was turned into a comedy for the film, the filmmakers retained some darker elements. The film references many classic Western films, notably ''[[Shane (film)|Shane]]''. The film was selected by the [[American Film Institute]] as the 10th greatest Western of all time in its [[AFI's 10 Top 10]] list in 2008.\n\n==Plot==\nCatherine \"Cat\" Ballou, a notorious outlaw, is set to be executed in the small town of Wolf City, [[Wyoming]]. Two banjo-playing \"Shouters\", Professor Sam the Shade and the Sunrise Kid, sing the ballad of Cat Ballou and regale the audience with the tale of how she began her career of crime.\n\nSome months prior, Catherine, then an aspiring schoolteacher, is returning home from finishing school by train to Wolf City. On the way, she unwittingly helps accused cattle rustler Clay Boone elude his captor, Sheriff Maledon, when Boone's Uncle Jed, disguised as a preacher, distracts the lawman.\n\nArriving home at her father (Frankie Ballou)'s ranch, Catherine learns that the Wolf City Development Corporation is scheming to take his ranch. Frankie's sole defender is his ranch hand, educated [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]], Jackson Two-Bears. Clay and Jed appear and reluctantly offer to help Catherine. She hires legendary gunfighter Kid Shelleen to help protect her father from gunslinger Tim Strawn, the tin-nosed hired killer who is threatening him.\n\nShelleen arrives and proves to be a drunken bum who is a crack shot only when he is inebriated. His presence proves to be useless as Strawn abruptly kills Frankie. When the townspeople refuse to bring Strawn to justice, Catherine becomes a revenge-seeking outlaw known as Cat Ballou. She and her gang rob a train carrying the Wolf City payroll, then take refuge in the desperado hideout \"[[Hole-in-the-Wall]]\". Shelleen is shocked to discover the legendary outlaw [[Butch Cassidy|Cassidy]] is now a humble saloonkeeper in Hole-in-the-Wall. \n\nThe gang is thrown out when it is learned what they have done, due to Hole-in-the-Wall's continued existence being dependent on the sufferance of Wolf City. Strawn arrives and threatens Cat. Shelleen, motivated by his affection for Cat, works himself into shape. Dressed up in his finest gunfighter outfit, he goes into town and kills Strawn, then reveals he is Strawn's brother.\n\nCat poses as a prostitute and confronts Sir Harry Percival, the head of the Wolf City Development Corporation. She attempts to force him into confessing that he ordered her father's murder. A struggle ensues and Sir Harry is killed. Cat is then sentenced to be hanged. With Sir Harry dead,  Wolf City's future is hopeless, and the townspeople have no mercy for Cat. As the noose is placed around her neck, Uncle Jed, again disguised as a preacher, appears and cuts the rope just as the trapdoor opens. Cat safely falls through and onto a wagon. Her gang spirits her away in a daring rescue.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n*[[Jane Fonda]] as Catherine \"Cat\" Ballou\n*[[Lee Marvin]] as Kid Shelleen / Tim Strawn\n*[[Michael Callan]] as Clay Boone\n*[[Dwayne Hickman]] as Uncle Jed\n*[[Nat King Cole]] as Shouter \u2013 Sunrise Kid\n*[[Stubby Kaye]] as Shouter \u2013 Sam the Shade\n*[[Tom Nardini]] as Jackson Two-Bears\n*[[John Marley]] as Frankie Ballou\n*[[Reginald Denny (actor)|Reginald Denny]] as Sir Harry Percival\n*[[Jay C.
