When an [[oil well]] owned by an American company catches fire, the company hires four European men, down on their luck, to drive two trucks over mountain dirt roads, loaded with [[nitroglycerine]] needed to extinguish the flames.\n\nThe film brought Clouzot international fame\u2014winning both the [[Golden Bear]] and the [[Palme d'Or]] at the [[1953 Berlin Film Festival]] and [[1953 Cannes Film Festival|Cannes Film Festival]], respectively\u2014and enabled him to direct ''[[Les Diaboliques (film)|Les Diaboliques]]'' (1955). In France, it was the fourth highest-grossing film of the year with a total of nearly 7 million admissions.<ref name=\"JPBox Office\">{{cite web|url=http://www.jpbox-office.com/fichfilm.php?id=9602&affich=france |title=Le Salaire de la peur (1953)|work=jpbox-office.com|year=2014|access-date=8 August 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n[[French people|Frenchmen]] Mario and Jo, [[Germans|German]] Bimba and [[Italians|Italian]] Luigi are stuck in the isolated town of Las Piedras. Surrounded by desert, the town is linked to the outside world only by an airstrip, but the airfare is beyond the means of the men. There is little opportunity for employment aside from the American corporation that dominates the town, Southern Oil Company (SOC), which operates the nearby oil fields and owns a walled compound within the town. SOC is suspected of unethical practices such as exploiting local workers and taking the law into its own hands, but the townspeople's dependence upon it is such that they suffer in silence.\n\nMario is a sarcastic Corsican playboy, who treats his devoted lover, Linda, with disdain. Jo is an aging ex-[[gangster]] who just recently found himself stranded in the town. Bimba is an intense, quiet man whose father was murdered by the [[Nazis]], and who himself worked for three years in a [[salt mine]]. Luigi, Mario's roommate, is a jovial, hardworking man, who has just learned that he is dying from cement dust in his lungs. Mario befriends Jo due to their common background of having lived in [[Paris]], but a rift develops between Jo and the other cantina regulars because of his combative, arrogant personality.\n\nA massive fire erupts at one of the SOC oil fields. The only way to [[Oil well fire#Extinguishing the fires|extinguish]] the flames and cap the well is an explosion caused by [[nitroglycerine]]. With short notice and lack of proper equipment, it must be transported within [[jerrycan]]s placed in two large trucks from the SOC headquarters, 500&nbsp;km (300 miles) away. Due to the poor condition of the roads and the highly volatile nature of nitroglycerine, the job is considered too dangerous for the [[Trade Union|unionized]] SOC employees.\n\nThe company foreman, Bill O'Brien, recruits truck drivers from the local community. Despite the dangers, many of the locals volunteer, lured by the high pay: US$2,000 per driver. This is a fortune to them, and the money is seen by some as the only way out of their dead-end lives. The pool of applicants is narrowed down to four handpicked drivers: Mario, Bimba and Luigi are chosen, along with a German named Smerloff. Smerloff fails to appear on the appointed day, so Jo, who knows O' Brien from his bootlegging days, is substituted in his place. The other drivers suspect that Jo intimidated Smerloff in some way to facilitate his own hiring.\n\nJo and Mario transport the nitroglycerin in one vehicle; Luigi and Bimba are in the other, with thirty minutes separating them in order to limit potential casualties. The drivers are forced to deal with a series of physical and mental obstacles, including a stretch of extremely rough road called \"the washboard\", a construction barricade that forces them to teeter around a rotten platform above a precipice, and a boulder blocking the road. Jo finds that his nerves are not what they used to be, and the others confront Jo about his increasing cowardice. Finally, Luigi and Bimba's truck explodes without warning, killing them both.\n\nMario and Jo arrive at the scene of the explosion only to find a large crater rapidly filling with oil from a pipeline ruptured in the blast. Jo exits the vehicle to help Mario navigate through the oil-filled crater. The truck, however, is in danger of becoming bogged down and during their frantic attempts to prevent it from getting stuck, Mario runs over Jo. Although the vehicle is ultimately freed from the muck, Jo is mortally wounded. On their arrival at the oil field, Mario and Jo are hailed as heroes, but Jo is dead and Mario collapses from exhaustion. Upon his recovery, Mario heads home in the same truck, now freed of its dangerous cargo. He collects double the wages following his friends' deaths, and refuses the appointed chauffeur offered by SOC. Mario jubilantly drives down a mountain road, while a party is being held at the cantina back in town where Mario's friends eagerly await his arrival, which is expected to be in two hours. Mario swerves recklessly and intentionally, having cheated death so many times on the same road. Linda, dancing in the cantina, faints.  Mario takes one corner too fast and plunges through the guardrail to his death.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Yves Montand]] as Mario\n* [[Charles Vanel]] as Jo\n* [[Folco Lulli]] as Luigi\n* [[Peter van Eyck]] as Bimba\n* [[V\u00e9ra Clouzot]] as Linda\n* [[William Tubbs]] as Bill O'Brien\n* [[Dar\u00edo Moreno]] as Hernandez\n* [[Jo Dest]] as Smerloff\n* [[Luis De Lima]] as Bernardo\n* [[Antonio Centa]] as Camp Chief\n* [[Darling L\u00e9gitimus]] as Rosa\n\n==Reception and legacy==\n''The Wages of Fear'' was critically hailed upon its original release.
