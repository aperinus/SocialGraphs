Starring [[Eric Mabius]] as [[Crow (comics)|Alex Corvis]] and the third installment of [[The Crow (franchise)|''The Crow'' film series]], based on the [[The Crow|comic book character of the same name]] by [[James O'Barr]]. After its distributor cancelled the intended wide theatrical release due to ''[[The Crow: City of Angels]]''' negative critical reception, ''The Crow: Salvation'' was released [[direct-to-video]] after a limited theatrical run.\n\n==Plot==\n\nIn [[Salt Lake City]], Alexander \"Alex\" Frederick is framed for the murder of his girlfriend, Lauren Randall and sentenced to death. Three years later he is executed in the [[electric chair]] suffering a painful death due to lighting overriding the energy of the chair.\n\nThe Crow that was mysteriously resurrected after the events of [[The Crow: City of Angels|City of Angels]], resurrects Alex and gives him supernatural abilities that would allow him to avenge Lauren\u00b4s death. Alex follows the crow and finds evidences that Lauren was killed by a group of corrupt cops, including one that has a scar on his arm that match the one he saw just before his execution. Later he encounters Erin, Lauren\u00b4s sister, who believes that he is guilty, but he tells her that he will prove his innocence.\n\nLater Alex finds a witness in the trial who was bribed to give perjured testimony and forces him to confess that five members of the police forces, Detective Madden, Martin Toomey, Vincent Erlich, Stan Roberts and Phillip Dutton killed Lauren.\n\nAlex begin his road to vengeance killing Dutton while saving two young girls from being raped by him, then he provokes Erlich to die in a car crash, but he drops the list of the cops he is after, being found by Roberts and Toomey. With evidences found in Erlich\u00b4s car, Alex and Erin find out that, Nathan Randall, Erin and Lauren's father, is in business with the corrupt cops and is indirectly responsible for her death when Lauren uncovered the truth. Erin runs in horror from Nathan when he is confronted with the truth.\n\nErin confesses to Alex that she felts guilty for Lauren\u00b4s murder because she told the cops where they can find Lauren, thinking that they would only arrest Alex. With his powers, Alex shows that Lauren fought off her attackers and how Erin should forgive herself. When she comes back home she finds her father killed himself out of remorse. Later, Alex finds out from his lawyer, Peter Walsh, that one of Nathan's businesses was revealed as a front for a drug smuggling operation and Lauren had witnessed Roberts killing a man in the Key Club, leading to her death.\n\nMadden kills Walsh and Book kidnaps Erin. Alex starts a shootout at the Key Club in which he impales Roberts with a pipe he breaks off the ceiling, and kills the remaining police. Madden shows up and tries to kill Alex, but his shot accidentally shoots a broken gas pipe; the explosion kills Toomey. Alex walks out of the fire and sees an arm hanging out of the rubble with the scar on it and The Crow leaves him after he feels he \"fulfilled his duty\".\n\nHowever, Alex finds out that the man with the scarred arm had faked his death and heads to the police station to kill Book, but, without his powers he is stabbed by Book and dies from his wounds. In his agony, Alex begins to believe he caused Lauren\u00b4s death accepting his demise. Book brings Alex body to a room where Erin is tied with her mouth stitched shut and the body of Walsh is shown hanged and without an arm (that was used to make Alex believe his vengeance was fulfilled). Erin manages to drop Lauren\u00b4s locket and the Crow drops it next to Alex, being a promise a love and truth it makes Alex to revives, allowing him to set Erin Free and kill both Madden and the secretary while Book runs after Erin, Alex is able to catches up with them and exposes Book\u00b4s arm, showing the actual scar Alex saw during his execution.\n\nAlex and Erin take Book to the electric chair and execute him to the point to cremating him in the chair. Alex\u00b4s soul is finally released to reunite with Lauren and Erin keeps Lauren\u00b4s necklace with her.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n*[[Eric Mabius]] as [[Crow (comics)|Alexander \"Alex\" Frederick Corvis / The Crow]], Lauren's boyfriend, who is murdered via being framed and unfortunately wrongfully executed for her murder, then resurrected by a mystical crow and gifted supernatural abilities in order to clear his name and avenge her death.\n*[[Kirsten Dunst]] as Erin Randall, Nathan's daughter and Lauren's sister.\n*[[William Atherton]] as Nathan Randall, Erin and Lauren's father.\n*[[Grant Shaud]] as Peter Walsh\n*[[Jodi Lyn O'Keefe]] as Lauren Randall, Nathan's daughter, Erin's sister and Alex's girlfriend; who was killed by a group of corrupt cops, while her boyfriend Alex was framed and executed for her murder.\n*David H.
