It chronicles the early days of [[the Beatles]] in [[Hamburg]], [[West Germany|Germany]]. The film focuses primarily on the relationship between [[Stuart Sutcliffe]] ([[Stephen Dorff]]) and [[John Lennon]] ([[Ian Hart]]), and also with Sutcliffe's German girlfriend [[Astrid Kirchherr]] ([[Sheryl Lee]]). It has subsequently been made into a stage production.\n\n==Plot==\nThe film follows the Beatles through their pre-fame Hamburg days when [[Stuart Sutcliffe]], the band's bassist, meets German photographer [[Astrid Kirchherr]].\n\n==Cast==\n<!-- Cast and order per opening tombstone credits, roles per closing credits scroll -->\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Sheryl Lee]] as [[Astrid Kirchherr]]\n* [[Stephen Dorff]] as [[Stuart Sutcliffe]]\n* [[Ian Hart]] as [[John Lennon]]\n* [[Gary Bakewell]] as [[Paul McCartney]]\n* Chris O'Neill as [[George Harrison]]\n* [[Scot Williams]] as [[Pete Best]]\n* [[Kai Wiesinger]] as [[Klaus Voormann]]\n* [[Jennifer Ehle]] as [[Cynthia Lennon|Cynthia Powell]]\n}}\n\nIn addition, brief portrayals of other historical characters in these early days of the Beatles include Paul Duckworth as [[Ringo Starr]], Paul Humpoletz as [[Bruno Koschmider]], [[Wolf Kahler]] as [[Bert Kaempfert]] and James Doherty as [[Tony Sheridan]].\n\nHart had already played Lennon in the 1991 film ''[[The Hours and Times]]''.  Bakewell later reprised his role as McCartney in the 2000 [[television film]] ''[[The Linda McCartney Story]]''.  Williams reprised his role as Best in the 2000 television film ''[[In His Life: The John Lennon Story]]''.\n\n==Production==\n===Writing===\nThe original script was written by Iain Softley based on a series of 1988 interviews. After failing to secure funding, screenwriter Stephen Ward was brought in to completely rewrite the script in 1993. Ward interviewed Astrid Kirchherr and others who were close to the Beatles during their time in Hamburg. The project was [[Green-light|green-lit]] that year.\n\n===Soundtrack===\n{{Main|Backbeat (soundtrack)}}\nDue to the film's focus on the early days of the band, the [[Backbeat (soundtrack)|soundtrack]] includes no songs written by members of the Beatles but various songs the group performed in Hamburg, written and recorded by other artists. In this respect, rather than re-create the sounds of the period, iconoclastic, rebellious musicians were recruited (as a producer noted, the Beatles' pre-recording stage act was \"the [[punk rock|punk]] of its day\") to better convey the way the music was appreciated by audiences of the time. All musicians were members of contemporary American rock bands:\n \n* [[Dave Pirner]] ([[Soul Asylum]]): vocals (Paul McCartney)\n* [[Greg Dulli]] ([[The Afghan Whigs]]): vocals (John Lennon)\n* [[Thurston Moore]] ([[Sonic Youth]]): guitar\n* [[Don Fleming (musician)|Don Fleming]] ([[Gumball (band)|Gumball]]): guitar\n* [[Mike Mills]] ([[R.E.M.]]): bass guitar\n* [[Dave Grohl]] ([[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]]): drums\n* [[Henry Rollins]] ([[Black Flag (band)|Black Flag]]): vocals (Stuart Sutcliffe)\n\nThe film's distributor happened to be [[PolyGram Filmed Entertainment]] which was then under common ownership with [[Polydor Records]], the label that owned the rights to the Beatles' music from the Hamburg days.\n\n==Release==\nThe film premiered on 14 April 1994. It was then given a limited theatrical release.<ref>{{cite news |date=April 19, 1994 |title=Weekend Box Office : Hey, Chevy, the British Are Coming |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1994-04-19/entertainment/ca-47830_1_weekend-box-office |access-date=3 June 2012}}</ref> A DVD version was released by [[Universal Pictures|Universal]]  in 2005.\n\n==Reception==\n===Critics===\n''Backbeat'' holds a rating of 68% based on 40 reviews on [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the review aggregator site.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite web |title=Backbeat |url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/backbeat/ |website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]}}</ref> The site\u2019s consensus states, \"Its overly pretentious and melodramatic leanings notwithstanding, ''Backbeat'' explores the beginnings of the Fab Four with striking authenticity, soaring rock 'n' roll verve, and a strong admiration for its subjects.\"<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n[[Peter Travers]] of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' liked how the film captured the early 60s period through its visual style and use of music.<ref>{{cite web |last=Travers |first=Peter |author-link=Peter Travers |date=April 15, 1995 |title=Backbeat |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/movie-reviews/backbeat-101892/ |website=[[Rolling Stone]]}}</ref> Film critic [[Roger Ebert]] gave the film two out of four stars; although he thought the \"dialogue has real wit\", he felt the film is \"never able to convince us there's a story there\".<ref>{{cite web |last=Ebert |first=Roger |author-link=Roger Ebert |date=April 22, 1994 |title=Backbeat |url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/backbeat-1994 |website=www.rogerebert.com}}</ref>\n\n===The Beatles and others===\nAt the time of the film\u2019s release, [[Paul McCartney]] commented:<blockquote>One of my annoyances about the film ''Backbeat'' is that they've actually taken my rock 'n' rollness off me. They give John the song \"[[Long Tall Sally]]\" to sing and he never sang it in his life. But now it's set in cement. It's like the [[Buddy Holly]] and [[Glenn Miller]] stories. ''[[The Buddy Holly Story]]'' does not even mention [[Norman Petty]], and ''[[The Glenn Miller Story]]'' is a sugarcoated version of his life. Now ''Backbeat'' has done the same thing to the story of the Beatles.
