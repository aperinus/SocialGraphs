The film is about a trio of teenage girls who plot to break the heart of school [[basketball]] star John Tucker after they learn he has been secretly dating all three and pledging each is \"the one\". They recruit a shy, unpopular girl in their scheme to publicly humiliate him. Released in North America on July 28, 2006, the film made $68 million worldwide.\n\n==Plot==\nTeenaged Kate Spencer lives with her single mother, Lori, near [[Portland, Oregon]], where Kate works as a waitress. While at work, Kate sees popular local boy John Tucker on dates with three different girls: chronic [[Overachievement|overachiever]] Carrie, head [[cheerleader]] Heather, and promiscuous [[Veganism|vegan]] activist Beth. Kate learns from a co-worker that John dates girls from different [[clique]]s at his school so that they never interact. John convinces the girls to keep their relationships secret by claiming his father forbids him to date during basketball season.\n\nThe three girls learn about John's scheme after ending up on the same team in gym class. The girls enlist Kate's help in seeking revenge against John. The girls make several attempts to bring John down, but these initial pranks backfire. John breaks up with all three girls, and they agree that breaking his heart is the ideal revenge. They enlist Kate to be the heartbreaker.\n\nAfter a makeover, Kate joins the cheerleading squad to get John's attention. He tries to flirt with her, but Kate dismisses him. John is dismayed that a girl is impervious to his charms, being shy, and becomes determined to win her affections. He relentlessly chases after Kate, even driving by her house, much to the girls' amusement as they watch him fall for her.\n\nAfter a few dates, Beth notices that Kate is falling for John. To counteract this, Carrie secretly videotapes John bragging to his friends in the locker room, saying he will be \"scoring more than baskets\" at the upcoming [[away game]]. Upon seeing John's chauvinistic behavior, Kate recommits to the plan.\n\nAt a hotel on the night of the away game, Kate seduces John on a video-chat, instructing him to put on a lacy pair of girl's thong panties and climb out of his room and into hers. He mistakenly climbs into a teacher's room instead, and becomes the laughingstock of the school. John again uses this to his advantage, convincing the boys on his team that wearing the thong panties improves his game. Meanwhile, Kate's mother and Scott both discover the plan and lament the change in Kate's behavior.\n\nKate tells John that she heard about what he said in the locker room. John makes amends by giving her his watch and asking her to be his girlfriend. Kate tells Heather, Carrie, and Beth that she wants to be out of the plan, as whether they are dating or plotting to destroy John, it is still all about him. At John's birthday, the tape the girls made of John's destruction is played, and Kate reveals the entire plot in front of a devastated John.\n\nHeather, Beth, and Carrie defend Kate after a guest throws his drink at her. Still, John appears unfazed, and the party devolves into a cake fight. A few days later, John and Kate agree to be friends, and John resolves to be honest. Scott, happy that Kate confessed, becomes her lab partner again, and it is hinted the two will begin dating.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Brittany Snow]] as Kate Spencer\n* [[Jesse Metcalfe]] as John Tucker\n* [[Ashanti (singer)|Ashanti]] as Heather Montgomery \n* [[Sophia Bush]] as Beth McIntyre\n* [[Arielle Kebbel]] as Carrie Schaeffer\n* [[Penn Badgley]] as Scott Tucker\n* [[Fatso-Fasano]] as Tommy\n* [[Jenny McCarthy]] as Lori Spencer \n* [[Patricia Drake]] as Coach Williams\n* [[Taylor Kitsch]] as Justin\n* [[Kevin McNulty (actor)|Kevin McNulty]] as Basketball Coach\n* Amber Borycki as Jennifer \n* [[Meghan Ory]] as Jill\n* [[Greg Cipes]] as Guy at Party\n* Samantha McLeod as Holly\n* Nicole LaPlaca as Molly\n* [[People in Planes]] as themselves\n}}\n\n==Reception==\n===Box office===\nThe film premiered at [[Grauman's Chinese Theatre]], with Betty Thomas and Arielle Kebbel in attendance.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://variety.com/2006/scene/markets-festivals/tucker-finds-life-in-h-w-d-1200338969/ |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190430053726/https://variety.com/2006/scene/markets-festivals/tucker-finds-life-in-h-w-d-1200338969/ |archive-date=2019-04-30 |title='Tucker' finds life in H'w'd \u2013 Variety}}</ref>\nIn its opening weekend, the film grossed a total of $14.3 million, ranking third in the box office results for that weekend.

He praised [[Jenny McCarthy]], in a supporting role, saying she \"...is notably better than the rest of the cast.\" Medved concedes that his 17-year-old daughter was more the target demographic and that she liked the film enough to want to watch it again.<ref>{{cite web | first = Michael |last = Medved | author-link = Michael Medved | title = John Tucker Must Die | url = http://eyeonentertainment.net:80/ | quote = (Note: Click on \"READ MORE\" to expand the full text of the review.) | url-status = dead | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20060804031100/http://eyeonentertainment.net/ | archive-date = August 4, 2006 | access-date = February 7, 2020 }}</ref>\n[[James Berardinelli]] of ''ReelViews'' also disliked the film. He gave it 1.5 stars out of 4, saying \"The gulf is vast between what the studio wants us to think ''John Tucker Must Die'' is and what it really is. The marketers and publicists would have us believe this is a dark, edgy teen comedy about a band of two-timed girls taking revenge on the school's biggest hunk. Unfortunately, Betty Thomas' film is neither dark nor edgy (although it occasionally tries masquerading in those categories), nor is it particularly funny.\" He goes on to mention \"The movie may be able to bamboozle a few teen female fans into multiplexes, but it's hard to imagine any of them \u2013 even those who swoon at the sight of Jesse Metcalfe \u2013 labeling this as better than forgettable.
