A sequel to ''[[Journey to the Center of the Earth (2008 theatrical film)|Journey to the Center of the Earth]]'' (2008), the film is based on [[Jules Verne]]'s ''[[The Mysterious Island]]'' (1875). It stars [[Dwayne Johnson]], [[Michael Caine]], [[Josh Hutcherson]], [[Vanessa Hudgens]], [[Luis Guzm\u00e1n]], and [[Kristin Davis]]. The storyline was written by [[Richard Outten]], Brian Gunn and Mark Gunn, and the screenplay by Brian and Mark Gunn.\n\n''Journey 2: The Mysterious Island'' was released in cinemas on February 10, 2012, by [[Warner Bros. Pictures]], [[New Line Cinema]] and [[Walden Media]] to mixed reviews,<ref name=\"tomatoes\" /><ref name=\"metacritic\" /> but was a box office success with a worldwide gross of $335 million, surpassing its predecessor.<ref name=\"mojo\" /> It was released on DVD/Blu-ray on June 5, 2012.\n\n==Plot==\nFour years after his [[Journey to the Center of the Earth (2008 theatrical film)|adventure in the center of the earth]], 17-year-old Sean Anderson is arrested by the police for breaking into a satellite control center.\n\nHe did this in hopes of enhancing a coded signal that could have been sent by his long-missing grandfather, Alexander Anderson. Wanting to bond with Sean, his stepfather Hank helps decipher the code, which leads to three books: ''[[Treasure Island]]'', ''[[Gulliver's Travels]]'', and [[Jules Verne]]'s ''[[The Mysterious Island|Mysterious Island]]''. Using the books' individual maps, Hank uses a backlight to make them a single island, complete with the coordinates to its location. Hoping to prove to Sean that there is no mysterious island there, Hank agrees to take him to where the coordiantes point to.\n\nIn [[Palau]], Hank reluctantly hires helicopter tourism guide Gabato and his daughter Kailani (on whom Sean develops an immediate crush) to fly to the coordinates, as they are the only ones willing to take them. The helicopter gets caught in a [[Tropical cyclone|cyclone]] and they crash into the Pacific, waking up on the island.\n\nMoving inland, they are shocked to discover miniature elephants (which belong to a prehistoric species, the [[Palaeoloxodon falconeri|Dwarf sicilian elephant]]) and giant butterflies. After coming across an egg clutch, Gabato accidentally wakes up a giant frilled lizard, which chases them throughout the jungle. They nearly get eaten, but are saved by Alexander. He takes them to a hut he built from the wreckage of the ship that brought him to the island. He has a working radio, but due to the positioning of the satellite, it will be two weeks before they can call out.\n\nThe next morning, Alexander leads the group to the lost city of [[Atlantis]], which rises every 70 years and sinks again after a couple of days. Their only means of salvation seems to be the legendary ''[[Nautilus (Verne)|Nautilus]]'', [[Captain Nemo]]'s submarine. Kailani enters Nemo's crypt and finds his journal, which shows that ''Nautilus'' is in a cave at [[Poseidon]]'s Cliffs.\n\nTo go there, they mount giant bees and fly over a high ridge. When giant [[bee-eater]] birds try to devour them, Sean saves Kailani's life, but dislocates his ankle. Hank and Alexander reset Sean's ankle, then the group has a bonding moment when Hank sings his rendition of \"[[What a Wonderful World]]\" to ease Sean's pain.\n\nThe next morning, the water rises greatly and Hank deduces that the island will sink in a matter of hours. Gabato is missing, having gone toward the island's [[volcano]] in search of gold. While Alexander and Kailani go after him, Sean and Hank head for Poseidon's Cliffs.\n\nTo reach ''Nautilus''{{'}} underwater cave, Sean and Hank create makeshift oxygen tanks and dive down fifty feet, but are nearly killed by a giant [[electric]] [[moray eel]]. The 140-year-old batteries have run down, so they engineer a way to start the submarine with the eel's electricity.\n\nKailani and Alexander find Gabato and convince him to escape with them instead of trying for the volcano. As they near Poseidon's Cliffs, the volcano erupts. Sean and Hank arrive in ''Nautilus'' just in time to rescue the others from the water. Gabato pilots the submarine out of harm's way while Hank and Sean fire torpedoes into the path of falling debris. As they clear the dangers, Kailani kisses Sean for his bravery.\n\nSix months later, Kailani and Gabato are well off, as he runs the most popular tourist attraction on Palau{{snd}}tours aboard the ''Nautilus''. Kailani visits Sean on his birthday. While the family celebrates, Alexander arrives with a book for Sean's birthday present{{snd}}Jules Verne's ''[[From the Earth to the Moon]]'', Alexander's suggestion for the next new adventure with the family.\n\n==Cast==\n<!--- Cast and order and spelling per tombstone closing credits, plus remaining 4, roles per closing credits scroll --->\n* [[Dwayne Johnson]] as Hank, Sean's stepfather and a former Navy code breaker.\n* [[Michael Caine]] as Alexander, Sean's grandfather who is the father of Max and Trevor Anderson from the [[Journey to the Center of the Earth (2008 theatrical film)|previous film]].\n* [[Josh Hutcherson]] as Sean, Hank's stepson who wants to find his missing grandfather on the Mysterious Island.\n* [[Luis Guzm\u00e1n]] as Gabato, Kailani's father, who is part of the father-daughter tour guide team.\n* [[Vanessa Hudgens]] as Kailani, part of the father-daughter tour guide company and Sean\u2019s love interest.\n* [[Kristin Davis]] as Liz, Sean's mother and Hank's wife.

Brian Gunn and [[Mark Gunn (screenwriter)|Mark Gunn]] were chosen to revise Outten's script.
