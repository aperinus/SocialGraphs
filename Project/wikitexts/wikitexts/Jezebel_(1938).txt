It stars [[Bette Davis]] and [[Henry Fonda]], supported by [[George Brent]], [[Margaret Lindsay]], [[Donald Crisp]], [[Richard Cromwell (actor)|Richard Cromwell]], and [[Fay Bainter]]. The film was adapted by Clements Ripley, Abem Finkel, [[John Huston]], and [[Robert Buckner]], from the 1933 play by [[Owen Davis]] Sr.\n\nThe film tells the story of a headstrong young [[U.S. southern states|Southern]] woman during the [[Antebellum era|antebellum]] period whose actions cost her the man she loves.\n\n==Plot==\n[[Image:Henry Fonda and Bette Davis in Jezebel trailer.jpg|right|thumb|260px|Fonda and Davis in a trailer for the film.]]\n[[Image:Jezebel-1938.jpg|thumb|300px|At Halcyon, Julie puts on the white dress she had originally planned to wear to the Olympus Ball as she waits to humble herself before Pres on his return from the North. (George Brent is second from the left.)]]\nIn 1852 [[New Orleans]], spoiled, strong-willed [[Southern belle|belle]] Julie Marsden is engaged to banker Preston \"Pres\" Dillard. In an important meeting, Pres is trying to convince the board to invest in railroads, as Northerners are doing, and supporting Dr. Livingstone's plea for measures to prevent another outbreak of [[yellow fever]].\n\nIn retaliation for Pres refusing to leave the meeting and accompany her to the last fitting for a ball gown, Julie buys a brazen red satin dress ordered by a notorious woman. At the Olympus Ball, the most important social event of the year, unmarried women are expected to wear virginal white. All of Julie's friends are horrified, but no one can convince her to give up her whim.\n\nAt the Olympus Ball, Julie's attire is met with shock and disgust by all present. She begs Pres to take her away, but instead he forces her to dance with him while all the other couples leave the floor. When the orchestra stops playing at the instruction of one of the ball's sponsors, Pres tells the conductor to continue. Pres and Julie finish the dance.\n\nAfterwards, Pres takes his leave of Julie, implicitly breaking their engagement. In a final act of spite, Julie slaps him in the face. Aunt Belle Massey urges her to go after him, but she refuses, stating that he will return to her. Instead, he goes North on business. Julie shuts herself up in her house and refuses to see visitors.\n\nA year later, Pres finally returns, bringing his Northern<!-- Bostonian\u2014check --> wife, Amy to a homecoming party in his honor at Halcyon [[Plantation complexes in the Southern United States|Plantation]], Julie's estate. Aunt Belle cannot find Julie in time to warn her. Wearing a luminous white gown, before Pres can stop her, Julie humbles herself and begs for his forgiveness and a return of his love. Then Pres introduces her to Amy.\n\nJulie eggs on her longtime admirer, skilled [[Code duello|duellist]] Buck Cantrell, to quarrel with Pres, but the scheme goes awry. It is Pres's inexperienced brother Ted who is goaded into challenging Buck. In an unexpected twist, Ted kills Buck.\n\nThen, as Dr. Livingstone foretold, [[History of yellow fever#New Orleans, Louisiana: 1853|a deadly epidemic sweeps through the city]]. They fight it with cannon and smoke and, believing that yellow fever is highly contagious, a [[quarantine]] so rigid that people who try to escape\u00a0the city are shot. In New Orleans, Pres is stricken and, like all other victims, is to be quarantined in the [[leper colony]] on Lazaret Island. Julie goes to Dr. Livingstone's place and nurses Pres for a night and a day. The family arrives, thanks to a pass from the governor. When the wagon comes for Pres, Amy begs to go with him, but Julie tells her that she is not equipped to fight for Pres. She does not know the [[Creole language|creole]] words for food and water, or how to deal with the conditions or the people there. Julie begs to go in her place to try to redeem herself. Before agreeing, Amy asks if Pres still loves Julie. Julie declares that he loves only his wife. Amy blesses them, and Julie accompanies Pres on a wagon loaded with other victims and caregivers.\n\n==Cast==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| [[Image:Bette Davis in Jezebel trailer 1.jpg|70px]] ||[[Bette Davis]] as Julie Marsden || [[Image:Henry Fonda in Jezebel trailer.jpg|70px]] ||[[Henry Fonda]] as Preston Dillard\n|-\n| [[Image:George Brent in Jezebel trailer.jpg|70px]] ||[[George Brent]] as Buck Cantrell ||[[Image:Donald Crisp in Jezebel trailer.jpg|70px]] ||[[Donald Crisp]] as Dr. Livingstone\n|-\n| [[Image:Fay Bainter in Jezebel trailer.jpg|70px]] ||[[Fay Bainter]] as Aunt Belle Massey || ||\n|-\n|}\n\n* [[Margaret Lindsay]] as Amy Bradford Dillard\n* [[Richard Cromwell (actor)|Richard Cromwell]] as Ted Dillard\n* [[Henry O'Neill]] as General Theopholus Bogardus\n* [[Spring Byington]] as Mrs. Kendrick\n* [[John Litel]] as Jean La Cour\n* [[Gordon Oliver]] as Dick Allen\n* [[Janet Shaw (actress)|Janet Shaw]] as Molly Allen\n* [[Theresa Harris]] as Zette\n* [[Margaret Early]] as Stephanie Kendrick\n* [[Irving Pichel]] as Huger\n* [[Eddie Anderson (comedian)|Eddie Anderson]] as Gros Bat\n* [[Matthew \"Stymie\" Beard]] as Ti Bat (credited as Stymie Beard)\n* [[Lew Payton]] as Uncle Cato\n* George Renevant as De Lautruc\n* [[Ann Codee]] as Mme.

[[Frank Nugent|Frank S. Nugent]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote that the film \"would have been considerably more effective ... if its heroine had remained unregenerate to the end. Miss Davis can be malignant when she chooses, and it is a shame to temper that gift for feminine spite ...

In her commentary about Davis, Basinger relates that this film is distinctive in the realm of women's pictures because of [[Orry-Kelly]]'s brilliant costume designs for the actress. Basinger states that the viewer is compelled to watch Davis in four stylings in particular:  the riding crop/outfit in the beginning of the film, the scandalous scarlet red dress at the Olympus Ball, the virginal white dress she wears when she attempts to woo back Henry Fonda, and finally the cape she dons at the end of the film when she must go to help care for Fonda. In Basinger's opinion, this was the performance at the height of Davis's career and ''Jezebel'' is the quintessential American [[woman's film]].\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of American films of 1938]]\n\n==References==\n;Notes\n{{Reflist}}\n\n;Bibliography\n* {{cite book|author=Dunning, John|title=On the Air: The Encyclopedia of Old-Time Radio|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|year=1998|isbn=0-19-507678-8|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/onairencyclop00dunn}}.\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category}}\n* [https://www.loc.gov/static/programs/national-film-preservation-board/documents/Jezebel.pdf ''Jezebel''] essay by Gabriel Miller on the [[National Film Registry]] website\n* [https://books.google.com/books?id=PxMWDQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_similarbooks ''Jezebel''] essay by Daniel Eagan in America's Film Legacy, 2009-2010: A Viewer's Guide to the 50 Landmark Movies Added To The National Film Registry in 2009-10, Bloomsbury Publishing USA, 2011, {{ISBN|1441120025}} pages 56\u201359\n*{{tcmdb title|id=673|title=Jezebel}}\n* {{Amg movie|26159|Jezebel}}\n* {{IMDb title|id=0030287|title=Jezebel}}\n* {{AFI film|id=3971|title=Jezebel}}\n* {{Rotten Tomatoes|jezebel|Jezebel}}\n* [http://www.cosmopolis.ch/english/film/e00114/jezebel_e00114.htm Jezebel review and information in cosmopolis.ch]\n\n{{William Wyler}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Jezebel (Film)}}\n[[Category:1938 films]]\n[[Category:American romantic drama films]]\n[[Category:American black-and-white films]]\n[[Category:1938 romantic drama films]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Max Steiner]]\n[[Category:Films directed by William Wyler]]\n[[Category:Films featuring a Best Actress Academy Award-winning performance]]\n[[Category:Films featuring a Best Supporting Actress Academy Award-winning performance]]\n[[Category:Films set in New Orleans]]\n[[Category:Films set in 1852]]\n[[Category:Films set in 1853]]\n[[Category:United States National Film Registry films]]\n[[Category:Warner Bros. films]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by John Huston]]\n[[Category:American films based on plays]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by Clements Ripley]]\n[[Category:1930s English-language films]]\n[[Category:1930s American films]]"}]}}}}
