It is a  psychological, black-humored satire on corruption in high office,<ref>{{cite web |last1=Weber |first1=Bill |title=Blu-ray Review: Investigation of a Citizen Above Suspicion |url=https://www.slantmagazine.com/dvd/investigation-of-a-citizen-above-suspicion/ |access-date=6 September 2019 |website=www.slantmagazine.com}}</ref> telling the story of a top police officer who kills his mistress, and then tests whether the police would charge him for this crime. He begins manipulating the investigation by planting obvious clues while the other police officers ignore them, either intentionally or not.\n\nThe film was released in Italy by Euro International Pictures on 9 February 1970, to widespread acclaim from critics. It won the [[Jury Prize (Cannes Film Festival)|Jury Prize]] at the [[1970 Cannes Film Festival]], and the [[David di Donatello|David di Donatello Awards]] for [[David di Donatello for Best Film|Best Film]] for [[David di Donatello for Best Actor|Best Actor]] (Gian Maria Volont\u00e9).

He insinuates himself into the investigation, planting clues to steer his subordinate officers toward a series of other suspects, including the woman's [[homosexuality|gay]] husband and a student leftist radical. He then exonerates the other suspects and leads the investigators toward himself to prove that he is \"above suspicion\" and can get away with anything, even while being investigated. He eventually confesses to the crime in front of his superiors - who refuse to believe him. Sure that he is safe, he recants his confession, and receives the approval of the police commissioner. The interrogation at his home is revealed to be a dream sequence and the film ends with the actual arrival of the commissioner and other colleagues.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Gian Maria Volont\u00e9]] as \"Il Dottore\" ('the Doctor'), the Police Inspector\n* [[Florinda Bolkan]] as Augusta Terzi\n* Gianni Santuccio as the Police Commissioner\n* [[Orazio Orlando]] as Brigadier Biglia\n* Sergio Tramonti as Antonio Pace\n* [[Salvo Randone]] as the Plumber\n* [[Arturo Dominici]] as Mangani\n* Aldo Rendine as Nicola Panunzio\n* [[Massimo Foschi]] as Claudio Terzi\n* [[Vittorio Duse]] as Canes\n* Aleka Paizi as the Housekeeper\n* Pino Patti as the Wiretapping Supervisor\n* [[Gianfranco Barra]] as Agent Giusti\n}}\n\n==Release==\n''Investigation of a Citizen Above Suspicion'' was released in Italy on February 9, 1970, where it was distributed by Euro International Films.{{sfn|Curti|2013|p=39}} In Italy, the film had a domestic gross of 1,928,248,000 [[Italian lire]].{{sfn|Curti|2013|p=39}}\n\n== Critical reception ==\n''Investigation of a Citizen Above Suspicion'' was well received by critics and is widely considered one of the best international films of the 1970s. ''[[The New York Times]]'' called the film \"a suspense melodrama with the moral concerns of angry satire [...] When it opened in Italy early this year (and later, when it was shown at [[Cannes Film Festival|Cannes]]), ''Investigation'' was hailed for the ways in which it exposed the corrupt, authoritarian practices of the police, who place themselves above their own laws [...] The story moves forward with a relentless momentum. It is a political parable, and a stunning movie.\"<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1970/12/21/archives/film-investigation-of-a-citizen-above-suspicionsuspense-melodrama.html | work=[[The New York Times]] | first=Vincent | last=Canby | title=Film: 'Investigation of a Citizen Above Suspicion':Suspense Melodrama Opens at Baronet | date=1970-12-21}}</ref>\n\nThe film has a [[Rotten Tomatoes]] approval of 100% based on 15 reviews, with an average score of 8 out of 10.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/investigation_of_a_citizen_above_suspicion/ |title = Investigation of a Citizen Above Suspicion (1970) |work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |access-date=2022-04-01 }}</ref> On [[Metacritic]]  it has a score of 89 out of 100 based on 10 reviews.<ref>{{cite web |title=Investigation of a Citizen Above Suspicion [re-release] |url=https://www.metacritic.com/movie/investigation-of-a-citizen-above-suspicion-re-release |website=[[Metacritic]] |access-date=2022-01-01 }}</ref> \nDavid Fear of [[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out]] called it \"[a] paranoid [[police procedural]], a perverse parable about the corrupting elements of power, and a candidate for the greatest predated [[Patriot Act]] movie ever [...]\".<ref>{{Cite web |date= |author=David Fear |work=Timeout | url=https://www.timeout.com/us/film/investigation-of-a-citizen-above-suspicion |title = Investigation of a Citizen Above Suspicion }}</ref> [[Kenneth Turan]] called the film \"as troubling today as when it came out in 1970.
