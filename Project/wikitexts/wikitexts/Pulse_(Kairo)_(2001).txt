It features two parallel story lines.\n\n===First story===\n\nMichi Kudo ([[Kumiko As\u014d]]) has recently moved to [[Tokyo]] and begun working at a shop that sells plants. Her co-workers include Junko Sasano, Toshio Yabe, and Taguchi, who has been missing for several days while working on a [[computer disk]] for the shop's sales. Michi goes to Taguchi's apartment and finds him distracted and aloof; during their conversation, he casually makes a noose, goes into a other room, and hangs himself. Michi and her friends inspect the disk he left behind and discover it contains an image of Taguchi staring into his own computer monitor, on which Taguchi staring into his monitor can be seen - creating an endless series of images. In the other monitor on his desk, they discover a ghostly face staring out into Taguchi's room.\n\nYabe receives a phone call and hears a distorted voice saying \"help me.\" Upon checking his phone, he sees the same image found on Taguchi's disk. He goes to Taguchi's apartment and sees a black stain on the wall where he hanged himself, as well as a paper with \"how to make a forbidden room\" (akazu no heya no tsukurikata) written on it. He notices a door sealed with red tape and enters it, where he encounters a ghost. Yabe becomes depressed and tells Michi that he saw something horrible in \"the forbidden room.\"\n\nMichi receives a call like the one Yabe got. She goes check on Yabe and finds a black stain on the wall like the one in Taguchi's apartment. She panics when she realizes Junko has unsealed and entered a \"forbidden room.\" Inside, she witnesses Junko being cornered by a ghost, and rescues her. Junko becomes [[catatonic]] from the encounter. She later steps toward the wall and becomes a black stain, which then dissolves and scatters as Michi tries in vain to stop it. Worried, Michi goes to check on her mother, who lives outside Tokyo.\n\n===Second story===\n\nRyosuke Kawashima, a university [[economics]] student, has recently signed up to a new [[internet service provider]]. His computer accesses a website by itself, showing him disturbing images of people alone in dark rooms exhibiting bizarre behavior. That night, Ryosuke wakes up to find his computer on again with the disturbing images displaying and frantically unplugs it. The next day he goes to the university computer lab looking for answers and meets Harue Karasawa ([[Koyuki]]), a post-graduate computer science student, who suggests he either bookmark the page or [[Screenshot|screen capture]] the images for her to examine. Ryosuke attempts to do so, but finds that his computer will not follow his commands. Instead, a video plays of a man with his head in a plastic bag sitting in a room with the words \"HELP ME\" written all over the walls.\n\nA graduate student who Harue is working with explains to Ryosuke his theory that the souls of the dead have begun to invade the physical world. Harue confides her lifelong feelings of isolation to Ryosuke, then begins acting strangely, suggesting that ghosts would want to trap humans in their own loneliness rather than kill them. Ryosuke tries to escape with her to a faraway place on the train. However, their train stops, and Harue, seized by a desire to return home, runs away. Upon returning to her apartment, she witnesses the man with the plastic bag shoot himself on her computer. Harue then presses the \"enter\" key and sees a video of herself in the present moment on the screen. As she embraces the invisible figure watching her, Harue happily says that she is \"not alone\". When Ryosuke makes it to her apartment, she has vanished.\n\nAs people begin vanishing in great numbers, evacuations of Tokyo begin, and a full-scale invasion of the [[Kanto region]] by the ghosts is underway. Ryosuke meets Michi in her broken-down car, and after helping her repair it,, she goes with him to search for Harue. They find Harue in an abandoned factory, where she shoots herself. When Ryosuke and Michi's car runs out of gas, Ryosuke enters the warehouse to search for fuel. He drops the gas cap, which rolls through the open doorway of a \"forbidden room.\" When he goes to retrieve it, the door locks behind him and he encounters a ghost who insists that it is \"real\" and tells him that \"death was eternal loneliness\". Although he tries to resist the ghost's influence, Ryosuke loses the will to live, and Michi drags him to safety. They drive through a deserted, ravaged Tokyo, encountering [[Apocalypse|apocalyptic]] scenery as well as a [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] cargo plane that crashes from the sky. After locating a small motorboat, the pair are found and brought aboard a ship departing from Tokyo, crewed by a small group of survivors who tell them that similar events are happening worldwide.\n\nReturning to the first scene of the film, Michi and the captain of the ship talk on the lower deck. As the ship heads for [[Latin America]], the captain encourages Michi, telling her that she is doing the right thing by continuing to live. She returns to her room on the ship, where she sees Ryosuke sitting against the wall with his eyes closed. He fades into a shadow as Michi declares that she has found happiness, being alone with her last friend in the world.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Kumiko As\u014d]] as Michi Kudo\n* Haruhiko Kato as Ryosuke Kawashima\n* [[Koyuki]] as Harue Karasawa\n* Kurume Arisaka as Junko Sasano\n* Masatoshi Matsuo as Toshio Yabe\n* [[Shinji Takeda]] as Yoshizaki\n* [[Jun Fubuki]] as Michi's mother\n* [[Shun Sugata]] as Boss\n* [[K\u014dji Yakusho]] as Ship Captain\n* [[Show Aikawa]] as Employee\n* [[Kenji Mizuhashi]] as Taguchi\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Release==\n''Pulse'' was first released in Japan on February 3, 2001, where it was distributed by [[Toho]].<ref name=\"arrow-2\">{{Cite AV media notes\n| title       = Pulse\n| year        = 2017\n| page        = 2\n| type        = booklet\n| publisher   = [[Arrow Films|Arrow Video]]\n| ID          = FCD1396\n}}</ref>\n\n[[Distant Horizon]] purchased worldwide distribution rights to the film from [[Daiei Film|Daiei]].<ref name=\"variety-buy\" /> The film premiered in the [[Un Certain Regard]] category at the [[Cannes Film Festival]].<ref name=\"variety-buy\">{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|title=Distant Horizon Nabs Rights to Japan's 'Kairo'|date=April 25, 2001|volume=271|issue=40|page=28|issn=0011-5509|last=Harris|first=Dana}}</ref>\n\n==Home video==\nThe film was released on [[DVD]] by [[Magnolia Pictures|Magnolia Home Entertainment]] on February 21, 2006.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/20277/pulse-kairo/|title=Pulse (Kairo)|author=Bill Gibron|location=[[DVD Talk]]|date=20 February 2006|access-date=1 December 2016}}</ref> [[Arrow Video]] has announced a [[Blu-ray]] release of the film for December 2016.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://bloody-disgusting.com/home-video/3405977/kiyoshi-kurosawas-kairo-pulse-getting-arrow-video-treatment/|title=Kiyoshi Kurosawa's 'Kairo' ('Pulse') Getting the Arrow Video Treatment!|publisher=[[Bloody Disgusting]]|author=Jonathan Barkan |date=9 September 2016|access-date=1 December 2016}}</ref>\n\nAs of October 2019, it is included as part of the subscription service run by the [[British Film Institute|BFI]].\n\n==Critical reception==\nThe review aggregator [[Rotten Tomatoes]] gives the film a rating of 74% based on 54 reviews, and a rating average of 6.8/10.
