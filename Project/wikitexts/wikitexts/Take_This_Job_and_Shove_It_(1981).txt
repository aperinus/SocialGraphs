Keith|David Keith]], and [[Dale Cross]] in his big screen debut.\n\nThe film was named after a popular [[Country music|country]] song, \"[[Take This Job and Shove It]]\", which was written by [[David Allan Coe]] and sung by [[Johnny Paycheck]]; both men had minor roles in the film.\n\n==Plot==\nA corporate conglomerate called \"The Ellison Group\" acquires four breweries, all of them experiencing financial trouble. Enter Frank Macklin (Robert Hays), a young manager hired by Ellison to help reorganize one of the ailing breweries, a major employer in his home town. Initially his old friends, who work at the brewery, give him a cold welcome as they think he'll be unable to revitalize the brewery. But when Frank informs them that the brewery is drowning in red ink, and that they may be losing their jobs soon, they welcome him with open arms, and ramp up the brewery's sales and production. The brewery improves so much that the Ellison Group decides to sell it to a Texas oil millionaire, who doesn't know the first thing about running a brewery or \u2014 apparently \u2014 running a business.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Robert Hays]] as Frank Macklin\n* [[Art Carney]] as Charlie Pickett\n* [[Barbara Hershey]] as J.M. Halsted\n* [[David L. Keith|David Keith]] as Harry Meade\n* [[Tim Thomerson]] as Ray Binkowski\n* [[Martin Mull]] as Dick Ebersol\n* [[Eddie Albert]] as Samuel Ellison\n* [[Penelope Milford]] as Lenore Meade\n* [[David Allan Coe]] as Mooney\n* [[Lacy J. Dalton]] as Mrs. Mooney\n* [[Royal Dano]] as Beeber\n* [[Virgil Frye]] as Cleach\n* [[James Karen]] as Loomis\n* [[Len Lesser]] as Roach\n* Suzanne Kent as Charmaine\n* [[Joan Prather]] as Madelyn\n* [[George Lindsey]] as semitruck driver\n* [[Johnny Paycheck]] as Man with hamburger\n* [[Charlie Rich]] as Hooker\n* [[Fran Ryan]] as Mrs. Hinkle\n* Stephan Meyers as Harry Meade, Jr.\n* Bob Chandler as the race flagman\n\n==Production==\nMost of the film was shot in [[Dubuque, Iowa]], and the [[Dubuque Star Brewery]]; some minor scenes were shot in [[Minneapolis, Minnesota]]. The [[Dubuque Star Brewery]] still stands today in the same location. It has been renovated and is now a private bar and grill.\n\n=== Bigfoot ===\n''Take This Job and Shove It'' was the first film to feature [[monster truck]]s. Bob Chandler's [[Bigfoot (truck)|Bigfoot #1]] is seen throughout the movie as Ray's pick-up truck. Everett Jasmer's [[USA-1 (monster truck)|USA-1]], credited as \"Thunderin' Lightning\", is the blue truck at the starting line that (in the script) breaks down when the race starts. Jasmer's daily delivery truck was used as the rival truck to Bigfoot, known as Silver Bullet. Both trucks are shown with 48-inch tires that were the then-standard monster truck tire (as opposed to the 66-inch tires that became standard later). Bob Chandler is seen as the flagman at the beginning of the race, and his family can be seen throughout the picnic sequences.\n\n==Release==\nThe film was released by [[Avco Embassy]] in the United States on May 15, 1981, and became somewhat of a sleeper hit. The film's final box office total was $17,569,027.<ref>{{cite news|title=''Take This Job and Shove It'' |work=[[Box Office Mojo]] |url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=takethisjobandshoveit.htm |accessdate=2014-06-25}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of American films of 1981]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title}}\n* {{AllMovie title}}\n* {{Rotten Tomatoes}}\n\n{{Gus Trikonis}}\n\n[[Category:1981 films]]\n[[Category:1980s English-language films]]\n[[Category:1981 comedy films]]\n[[Category:American business films]]\n[[Category:American comedy films]]\n[[Category:1980s business films]]\n[[Category:Culture of Dubuque, Iowa]]\n[[Category:Embassy Pictures films]]\n[[Category:Films about beer]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Iowa]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Minnesota]]\n[[Category:Films based on songs]]\n[[Category:1981 independent films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Gus Trikonis]]\n[[Category:1980s American films]]"}]}}}}
