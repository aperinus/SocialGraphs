Westlake]], writing as Richard Stark.<ref name=afi>{{AFI film|23319|Point Blank}}</ref> Boorman directed the film at Marvin's request and Marvin played a central role in the film's development. The film was not a box-office success in 1967, but has since gone on to become a [[Cult film|cult classic]], eliciting praise from such critics as film historian [[David Thomson (film critic)|David Thomson]].\n\nIn 2016, ''Point Blank'' was deemed \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\" by the United States [[Library of Congress]], and selected for preservation in its [[National Film Registry]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/item/prn-16-209/with-20000-leagues-the-national-film-registry-reaches-700/2016-12-14/|title=With \"20,000 Leagues\", the National Film Registry Reaches 700|website=Library of Congress|access-date=2019-05-21}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nWalker works with his friend Mal Reese to rob a major crime operation, ambushing the courier on deserted [[Alcatraz Island]]. After counting the money, Reese shoots Walker, leaving him for dead. Reese takes the money and Walker's wife, Lynne. Walker recovers. With assistance from the mysterious Yost, Walker sets out to find Reese and recover his half of the robbery: $93,000. Reese used all of the money from the job to pay back a debt to a crime syndicate called \"The Organization.\" Walker goes to Los Angeles where he bursts in on Lynne and riddles her bed with bullets, only to find Reese has long since disappeared. Lynne is distraught; she takes an overdose of sleeping pills.\n\nWalker approaches car dealer Stegman for information, smashing a new car and terrorizing him until Stegman says Reese is with Walker's sister-in-law, Chris.\n\nBreaking in on Chris, he learns that she despises Reese and admires Walker. Willing to help in any way, Chris agrees to a sexual tryst with Reese inside his heavily guarded penthouse apartment where she will unbolt a door for Walker. Walker ties up some men in an apartment across from the penthouse and has a call made to police to report a robbery, creating a diversion that enables him to slip into the penthouse.\n\nWith a gun to Reese's head, Walker persuades him to give up the names of his Organization superiors \u2013 Carter, Brewster, and Fairfax \u2013 so he can make somebody pay back his $93,000. He then forces the naked, bedsheet covered, Reese to the balcony saying that both will go and meet Carter together. Suddenly, a bodyguard switches on the light in the room they just left, calling for Reese. Startled, Walker backs up quickly still holding on to Reese behind him by the bedsheet. Forced to back up himself, Reese accidentally goes over the side and plunges to his death. Walker, still grasping the bedsheet, watches him fall.\n\nAfter next confronting Carter for his money, Walker is set up. A sniper is assigned to kill him at a money-drop in the paved [[Los Angeles River]] bed. Walker, suspecting a trap, forces Carter to get the money instead. Carter and Stegman both get shot at the pickup. The sniper leaves; Walker tears open the package of money, but finds only slips of blank paper.\n\nYost takes Walker to a house belonging to Brewster. Walker visits Chris in her apartment, which has been trashed by The Organization. He brings her with him to Brewster's house, claiming she will be safer with him. While waiting for Brewster, Chris slaps and punches Walker as he regards her impassively, not defending himself. She leaves the room. Walker hears noises from the kitchen and goes in to turn off several appliances which Chris has apparently turned on. She taunts him as \u201cwashed up\u201d over a speaker system. He finds her playing pool; she turns on him and hits him in the head with a pool cue.  They fall to the floor in an embrace, then go to bed and make love. The following morning, Brewster comes home and is ambushed by Walker, who demands his money. Walker forces Brewster to call Fairfax, but Fairfax refuses to pay. Brewster says the only cash available for Walker is in San Francisco. \u201cThe drop has changed, but the run is still the same\u201d, he explains.\n\nAt [[Fort Point, San Francisco|Fort Point]], Walker refuses to show himself as the courier delivers the money. Hiding in the dark is the sniper who shoots Brewster. Yost emerges from the shadows, telling Brewster that it was not Walker who shot him. Brewster calls out to Walker, \u201cThis is Fairfax, Walker! Kill him!\u201d\n\nYost/Fairfax thanks Walker (who is still hiding in the darkness) for eliminating his dangerous underlings, telling him: \u201cOur deal's done, Walker. Brewster was the last one.\u201d He offers a partnership, but Walker remains silent. Yost/Fairfax and the hit man go away while leaving the money on the ground.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Lee Marvin]] as Walker\n* [[Angie Dickinson]] as Chris\n* [[Keenan Wynn]] as Yost\n* [[Carroll O'Connor]] as Brewster\n* [[Lloyd Bochner]] as Frederick Carter\n* [[Michael Strong]] as Stegman\n* [[John Vernon]] as Mal Reese\n* [[Sharon Acker]] as Lynne Walker\n* [[James Sikking]] as hired gun\n* [[Sandra Warner]] as Sandy\n* [[Sid Haig]] as penthouse lobby guard\n* [[Stu Gardner]] as nightclub singer ''(uncredited)''\n}}\n\n==Production==\nIt was the second film produced by [[Irwin Winkler]] who had just made ''[[Double Trouble (1967 film)|Double Trouble]]'' at MGM. Winkler and Judd Bernard became enthusiastic about the ''Point Blank'' script and felt it would be ideal for [[Lee Marvin]]. They struggled to get the script to Marvin, so sent it to [[John Boorman]], an emerging director he knew from his management days.<ref>{{cite book|first=Irwin|last=Winkler|title=A Life in Movies: Stories from Fifty Years in Hollywood|pages=306\u2013318/3917|edition=Kindle|publisher=Abrams Press|year=2019}}</ref>\n\nBoorman met Marvin in London, where the actor was shooting ''[[The Dirty Dozen]]''. Boorman and Marvin talked about a script based on the book ''The Hunter'' by [[Donald Westlake]]. Both hated the script but loved Walker the main character. When they agreed to work on the film, Marvin discarded the script and called a meeting with the head of the studio, the producers, his agent and Boorman. As Boorman recalled, \"[Marvin] said, 'I have script approval?' They said 'yes'. 'And I have approval of principal cast?'. 'Yes'. He said, 'I defer all those approvals to John [Boorman].' And he walked out. So on my very first film in Hollywood, I had [[Final cut privilege|final cut]] and I made use of it\".<ref name=Commentary>{{cite AV media | people=[[John Boorman]] and [[Steven Soderbergh]] | title=Point Blank audio commentary | medium=DVD | publisher=[[Turner Entertainment]] | date=2005}}</ref>\n\nMGM agreed to finance a budget of $2 million. MGM's head of production Robert Weitman wanted the female lead played by [[Stella Stevens]] but Boorman (and Marvin) insisted on Angie Dickinson. Winkler claims he was then not surprised to see Stevens cast in a subsequent MGM film, ''[[Sol Madrid]]''.<ref>Winkler p 344-362/3917</ref>\n\nThe unusual structure of the film was due in part to the original script which adhered to the non-linear structure of the novel and developments during the shooting of the film.<ref name=Commentary/><ref>Shea, Matt (February 6, 2009).

He would just show you\". So Boorman changed the lines in the script so that Acker would essentially ask and answer Marvin's questions and the result is in the finished film. \"It made a conventional scene something more\" added Boorman.<ref name=Commentary/>\n\nThis was the first film shot at Alcatraz, the infamous prison which had been shut since 1963, only three years before the production.

The film's Director [[John Boorman]] claims to not have an opinion on the matter. \"What it is,<!--not a mistake--> is what you see\", responded Boorman. While filmmaker [[Steven Soderbergh]] has described ''Point Blank'' as \"memory film\" for Marvin. Boorman believes the film is about Lee Marvin's brutalizing experiences in [[World War II]], which dehumanized him and left him desperately searching for his humanity.<ref name=Commentary/>\n\nCritic [[David Thomson (film critic)|David Thomson]] has written that the character of Walker is actually dead throughout the entire movie and the events of the film are a dream of the accumulating stages of revenge.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Thomson|first1=David|title=The Big Screen: The Story of the Movies|date=2012|publisher=Macmillan|location=New York|isbn=978-0-374-19189-4|page=406|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MeAkGAnNfJYC&q=point+blank+lee+marvin+ghost&pg=PA406|access-date=22 December 2014}}</ref> Others have also considered this concept; Brynn White has questioned whether or not Walker is a mortal or a ghost, \"a vaporous embodiment of bitter vengeance barely clinging to Boorman's variegated frames\" and Boorman has commented: \"He could just as easily be a ghost or a shadow\".<ref>{{cite book|last1=Ruffles|first1=Tom|title=Ghost Images: Cinema of the Afterlife|date=2004|publisher=McFarland|location=Jefferson, North Carolina|isbn=0-7864-2005-7|page=237|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=za8FamEz9wIC|access-date=22 December 2014}}</ref> Some critics consider ''Point Blank'', \"a haunted, dream-like film that draws upon the spatial and temporal experiments of modernist European art cinema\", especially the \"time-fractured\" films of French director [[Alain Resnais]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Danks|first1=Adrian|title=A Man Out of Time: John Boorman and Lee Marvin's Point Blank|url=http://sensesofcinema.com/2007/cteq/point-blank/#b1|website=Senses of Cinema|publisher=Film Victoria, Australia|access-date=22 December 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Erickson|first1=Glenn|title=Point Blank|url= https://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/26570/the-young-philadelphians#articles-reviews|website=TCM Classic Movies|access-date=5 November 2022}}</ref>\n\n==Style==\n''Point Blank'' combines elements of ''[[film noir]]'' with stylistic touches of the European ''[[nouvelle vague]]''. The film features a fractured time-line (similar to the novel's non-linear structure), disconcerting narrative rhythms (long, slow passages contrasted with sudden outbursts of violence) and a carefully calculated use of film space (stylized compositions of concrete riverbeds, sweeping bridges, empty prison cells).<ref>[https://www.press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/H/bo6035389.html The Hunter: A Parker Novel], University of Chicago Press, accessed 03 July 2020</ref><ref name=Applegate>{{cite journal|author=Applegate, Tim|year=2002|url=http://www.thefilmjournal.com/issue8/pointblank.html|title=Remaking ''Point Blank''|journal=The Film Journal|issue=8|access-date=2011-01-19}}</ref> Boorman credits Marvin with coming up with a lot of the visual metaphors in the film.<ref name=Commentary/> Boorman said that as the film progressed, scenes would be filmed monochromatically around one color (the chilly blues and grays of Acker's apartment, Dickinson's butter yellow bathrobe, the startling red wall in Vernon's penthouse) to give the proceedings a \"sort of unreality\".<ref name=Commentary/><ref name=Applegate/>\n\nTo establish Walker's mythic stature, Soderbergh noted in the commentary, the film cuts from a shot of Walker swimming from Alcatraz to a shot of him on a ferry overlooking the same island while a woman on the loudspeaker describes the impossibility of leaving the island. Soderbergh said that this contrast of the character's ease of escape with the loudspeaker's monologue makes the Walker character \"mythic immediately\".<ref name=Commentary/>\n\n==Legacy==\n''Point Blank'' is hailed in the book ''[[1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die]]'' as \"The perfect thriller in both form and vision.\"<ref>Schneider, Stephen Jay (Editor) (October 1, 2008).
