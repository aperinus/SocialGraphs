Using the framework of [[Charles Dickens]]' 1843 novella ''[[A Christmas Carol]]'', the film follows liberal filmmaker Michael Malone (a parody of [[Michael Moore]]) as he is visited by three spirits to teach him the importance of [[Independence Day (United States)|Independence Day]]. The film satirizes [[liberalism in the United States]], with focus on Moore's documentaries. It stars [[Kevin Farley]] as Malone, alongside an [[ensemble cast|ensemble supporting cast]] that includes [[Kelsey Grammer]], [[Leslie Nielsen]], [[Trace Adkins]], [[Robert Davi]], and [[Jon Voight]].\n\nTheatrically released on October 3, 2008, by [[Gaiam Vivendi Entertainment|Vivendi Entertainment]], ''An American Carol'' received negative reviews from most critics, who found the film's humor and satire to be ineffective. It also was a failure at the box office grossing only $7 million against a $20 million budget. The film marked the final onscreen appearance by [[Dennis Hopper]] before his death in 2010.\n\n==Plot==\n[[Left wing politics|Left-wing]] activist and filmmaker Michael Malone campaigns to end the celebration of the [[Fourth of July]] holiday. Malone holds pronounced anti-American views and truculently argues that America's past and present are both offensive, and therefore should not be celebrated. He has finished another film entitled \"Die, You American Pigs!\" and just won the [[Leni Riefenstahl]] Award at the MooveAlong.org awards. They rush Malone off the stage before he can give a speech and his trophy is remarkably small, insignificant\u2014and turns out to be a keychain. Then they start televising the program and give out the Award for \"Best Film Director\" overall. Malone is already working on another anti-American film called \"Fascist America\".\n\nOn the evening of July 3, Malone watches a speech from President [[John F. Kennedy]] and mistakenly interprets the speech to mean avoiding war at any cost. President Kennedy rises out of the television set, corrects Malone regarding the intent of the speech, and informs him that he will be visited by three spirits.\n\nThe following morning, Malone is visited by General [[George S. Patton]] ([[Kelsey Grammer]]), who shows him an alternate United States where [[slavery]] still exists because [[Abraham Lincoln]] (founder of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]]) chose not to fight the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]. Malone later sees [[George Washington]] ([[Jon Voight]]) who gives a passionate speech about God's gift of freedom and the price many people pay for others to have it. Malone is visited by the angel of death ([[Trace Adkins]]), who takes him to a future [[Los Angeles]] completely taken over by radical [[Islamism|Islamists]]. He is then taken to the ruins of his hometown in [[Michigan]], which has been destroyed by a [[nuclear bomb]] planted by [[Al Qaeda]]. In a mortuary, Malone learns that he will be killed in this attack, leaving nothing behind but his trademark hat and \"big ass.\"  Facing his death, Malone pleads for his life with the Angel, promising to change. However, all is not well after Malone's revelation, for Aziz, a Middle Easterner he had interviewed, is actually a terrorist who will bomb a 4 July rally along with his underlings Ahmed and Fayed. However, when Fayed and Ahmed learn they are going to be detonated along with the planned bomb, they figure their slim chance of survival is by seeking out Malone.\n\nLater, Malone arrives at an anti-Fourth of July protest rally and publicly renounces his former views. This triggers an outraged mob from which he is rescued, however, by American servicemen. Meeting up with Malone, Ahmed and Fayed defuse their own bomb, thus sparing the people at the anti-Independence Day rally and resulting in the capture of the terrorist Aziz. Safe inside a [[country music]] concert, the three are formally welcomed to \"the real America\" by Trace Adkins (this time as himself). A reformed Malone then goes to a Navy base to see his nephew Josh off to the [[Persian Gulf]]. He tells Josh how very proud he is of him and promises to look in on his wife and family during his deployment. In the final scene, Malone now decides to make films he feels people would appreciate, as well as Fayed and Ahmed as part of the crew, who have been pardoned for foiling the bombing. Malone is last seen working on a biographical film about President Kennedy.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth= Vicki Browne as Rosie O'Connell}}\n* [[Kevin Farley]] as Michael Malone, a satirical caricature of documentary filmmaker [[Michael Moore]]\n* [[Kelsey Grammer]] as General [[George S.
