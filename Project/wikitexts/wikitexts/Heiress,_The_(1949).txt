The film stars [[Olivia de Havilland]] as Catherine Sloper, a naive young woman who falls in love with a handsome young man despite the objections of her emotionally abusive father who suspects the man of being a fortune hunter. [[Montgomery Clift]] stars as Morris Townsend, and [[Ralph Richardson]] as Dr. Sloper.<ref>''[[Variety Film Reviews]]'', September 7, 1949, p. 11.</ref><ref>''[[Harrison's Reports and Film Reviews]]''</ref>\n\n''The Heiress'' premiered in Los Angeles on October 6, 1949 and was theatrically released by [[Paramount Pictures]] on December 28, 1949. Although a box office failure, grossing $2.3 million on a $2.6 million budget, the film garnered critical acclaim, with reviewers praising Wyler's direction, its screenplay and the performances of the cast. The film received a leading eight nominations at the [[22nd Academy Awards]], including for the [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], and won four awards (more than any other film nominated that year); [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]] (for de Havilland), [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Best Original Score]], [[Academy Award for Best Production Design|Best Production Design]], and [[Academy Award for Best Costume Design|Best Costume Design]].\n\nIn 1996, ''The Heiress'' was selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".<ref>{{Cite web|last1=Stern|first1=Christopher|date=1996-12-03|title=National Film Registry taps 25 more pix|url=https://variety.com/1996/scene/vpage/national-film-registry-taps-25-more-pix-1117466310/|access-date=2020-10-13|website=Variety|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Complete National Film Registry Listing |url=https://www.loc.gov/programs/national-film-preservation-board/film-registry/complete-national-film-registry-listing/|access-date=2020-10-13|website=Library of Congress}}</ref>\n\n[[Universal Pictures]], through its [[EMKA, Ltd.|EMKA]] division, currently handles distribution of the film.\n\n==Plot==\nIn [[New York City]], sometime in the 1840s, Catherine Sloper is a plain, painfully shy woman whose father, Dr. Austin Sloper, makes no secret of his disappointment in her. Catherine, as her father painfully reminds her, has limited talent and cannot \"hold a candle\" to her deceased mother. Catherine's gregarious Aunt Lavinia Penniman moves into the household after becoming widowed and attempts to prod Catherine into being more social and finding a husband. \n\nWhen she meets the handsome Morris Townsend at a [[Ball_(dance_party)|ball]], Catherine is taken by the attention he lavishes upon her. Catherine falls madly in love with Morris and they plan to marry. Dr. Sloper believes Morris, being far more attractive and charming than Catherine, but poor and with few prospects after he wasted his own [[inheritance]], is courting Catherine only to get her sizable income. Aunt Lavinia favors the match regardless, being both romantic and pragmatic enough to view this as Catherine's chance at a happy married life. Morris is genuinely fond of Catherine's honesty and kindness despite his largely monetary motivations, and treats her with respect, unlike her father.\n\nA frank discussion with Morris's sister confirms Dr. Sloper's opinion of Morris as a [[gold digger]]. The doctor takes his daughter to [[Europe]] for an extended time to separate them. When they return to New York, Dr. Sloper threatens to disinherit his daughter if she marries Morris and they have a bitter argument in which Catherine realizes how poorly he views her.\n\nCatherine and Morris make plans to [[elope]] with the help of Aunt Lavinia. She eagerly packs her bags and waits all night for Morris to come and take her away, but he never comes. She drags her luggage back upstairs and puts her belongings away. Catherine is heartbroken and grows cold. Soon afterward, Dr. Sloper reveals he is dying. He tells Catherine that he is proud she resisted Morris, but Catherine vengefully tells her father she still loves Morris and dares him to change his will if he is afraid they will waste his money after he dies. He does not alter the will and dies, fretful, leaving her his entire estate. Catherine refuses to see him on his deathbed.\n\nA few years later, Morris returns from [[California]] having made nothing of himself and having even fewer prospects. Aunt Lavinia arranges for Morris to visit Catherine, thinking this is Catherine's last chance. Catherine gives Morris a gift of ruby buttons that she had bought for him in Paris. Morris eagerly promises to come back for her that night and she tells him she will start packing her bags. After Morris leaves, Catherine informs her aunt that she has no intention of offering her love to him. Her aunt asks her if she can be so cruel, and Catherine coldly responds \"Yes, I can be very cruel. I have been taught by masters.\" When Morris arrives later that night with the promised carriage, he rings the bell, and Catherine orders the maid to bolt the door, leaving Morris locked outside, shouting her name and banging on the locked door. Catherine ascends the stairs with a faint smile of triumph.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Olivia de Havilland]] as Catherine Sloper\n* [[Montgomery Clift]] as Morris Townsend\n* [[Ralph Richardson]] as Dr. Austin Sloper\n* [[Miriam Hopkins]] as Lavinia Penniman\n* [[Vanessa Brown]] as Maria\n* Betty Linley as Mrs. Montgomery\n* [[Ray Collins (actor)|Ray Collins]] as Jefferson Almond\n* [[Mona Freeman]] as Marian Almond\n* [[Selena Royle]] as Elizabeth Almond\n* Paul Lees as Arthur Townsend\n* [[Harry Antrim]] as Mr. Abeel\n* [[Russ Conway (actor)|Russ Conway]] as Quintus\n* David Thursby as Geier\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\nAfter seeing ''The Heiress'' on Broadway, [[Olivia de Havilland]] approached William Wyler about directing her in a screen adaptation of the play.<ref name=\":1\">{{cite web |last1=Hutchinson |first1=Pamela |title=The Heiress: A Cruel Inheritance |url=https://www.criterion.com/current/posts/6337-the-heiress-a-cruel-inheritance |website=The Criterion Collection |language=en}}</ref> He agreed and encouraged executives at [[Paramount Pictures]] to purchase the rights from the playwrights ([[Ruth Goetz|Ruth]] and Augustus Goetz) for $250,000 and offer them $10,000 per week to write the screenplay.
