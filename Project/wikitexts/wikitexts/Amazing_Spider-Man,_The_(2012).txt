It is the fourth [[Spider-Man in film|theatrical ''Spider-Man'' film]] produced by [[Columbia Pictures]] and [[Marvel Entertainment]], a [[Reboot (fiction)|reboot]] of the series following [[Sam Raimi]]'s [[Spider-Man (2002 film series)|2002\u20132007 ''Spider-Man'' trilogy]], and the first of the two [[The Amazing Spider-Man (film series)|''The Amazing Spider-Man'' films]]. The film was directed by [[Marc Webb]] and written by [[James Vanderbilt]], [[Alvin Sargent]] and [[Steve Kloves]] from a story by Vanderbilt, and stars [[Andrew Garfield]] as [[Peter Parker (The Amazing Spider-Man film series)|Peter Parker / Spider-Man]] alongside [[Emma Stone]], [[Rhys Ifans]], [[Denis Leary]], [[Campbell Scott]], [[Irrfan Khan]], [[Martin Sheen]], and [[Sally Field]]. In the film, after Parker is bitten by a genetically altered spider, he gains newfound, spider-like powers and ventures out to save the city from the machinations of the [[Lizard (character)|Lizard]].\n\nDevelopment of the film began following the cancellation of ''Spider-Man 4'' in January 2010, ending director Sam Raimi's ''Spider-Man'' film series that originally featured [[Tobey Maguire]] as the titular [[superhero]]. Columbia Pictures opted to reboot the franchise with the same production team along with Vanderbilt to stay on with writing the next ''Spider-Man'' film, while Sargent and Kloves helped with the script as well. During [[pre-production]], the main characters were cast in 2010. New designs were introduced from the comics, such as artificial web-shooters. Using [[Red Digital Cinema Camera Company]]'s RED Epic camera, [[principal photography]] started in December 2010 in [[Los Angeles]] before moving to New York City. The film entered [[post-production]] in April 2011. [[3ality Technica]] provided 3D image processing, while [[Sony Pictures Imageworks]] handled [[computer-generated imagery|CGI]] effects. This was also the final American film to be scored by [[James Horner]] and released during his lifetime, three years before his death on June 22, 2015 from an aircraft accident, as well as the penultimate film for both production designer [[J. Michael Riva]] and one of the producers [[Laura Ziskin]], who died on June 7, 2012, and June 12, 2011, respectively. J. Michael Riva's last film as production designer was ''[[Django Unchained]]'', released five months later and Ziskin's last film as producer was ''[[The Butler]]'', released one year later in 2013.\n\nSony Pictures Entertainment built a promotional website, releasing many previews and launching a [[viral marketing]] campaign, among other moves. Tie-ins included a [[The Amazing Spider-Man (2012 video game)|video game]] by [[Beenox]] and [[Activision]]. The film premiered on June 30, 2012, in Tokyo, and was released in the United States on July 3, ten years after the release of ''[[Spider-Man (2002 film)|Spider-Man]]'' (2002), in 2D, [[3D film|3D]], and [[IMAX]] 3D formats. It received mostly positive reviews from critics, who praised Garfield's performance, Webb's direction, visual effects, James Horner's musical score, and the realistic re-imagining and portrayal of the title character. The film was a box office success, grossing $758 million worldwide, becoming the [[2012 in film#Highest-grossing films|seventh highest-grossing film of 2012]]. A sequel, ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man 2]]'', was released on May 2, 2014. Garfield and Ifans reprised their roles in the MCU film ''[[Spider-Man: No Way Home]]'' (2021) which dealt with the concept of the [[Multiverse (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|multiverse]] and linked that franchise to the Raimi and Webb installments.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per [[WP:FILMPLOT]], plot summaries for featured film articles should be between 400 and 700 words. -->\nA young [[Peter Parker (The Amazing Spider-Man film series)|Peter Parker]] discovers that his father, business tycoon [[Richard and Mary Parker|Richard Parker]]'s study has been burgled. Peter's parents gather hidden documents, take Peter to the home of his [[Aunt May]] and [[Uncle Ben]], then mysteriously leave. Years later, a teenage Peter attends [[Midtown High School (comics)|Midtown Science High School]]; he is intelligent but socially awkward and often bullied. He also has a crush on [[Gwen Stacy (The Amazing Spider-Man film series)|Gwen Stacy]], who returns his feelings.\n\nLearning that his father is friends with [[Curt Connors (The Amazing Spider-Man film series)|Dr. Curt Connors]], a scientist at [[Oscorp]] in the field of [[Genetic engineering|cross-species genetics]], Peter sneaks into Oscorp, where he is bitten by a genetically modified spider. He then discovers he has developed spider-like abilities, such as superhuman strength, sharp senses, agility, and speed. Peter studies his father's papers and visits Connors, whose right arm is amputated above the elbow. Peter reveals he is Richard's son and gives Connors his father's \"decay rate algorithm,\" the missing piece in Connors' experiments on regenerating limbs. At home, Peter and Ben argue, and Peter leaves. While searching for him, Ben tries to stop [[Burglar (comics)|a thief]] that Peter allowed to escape, and is shot, dying in Peter's arms. Peter uses his new abilities to track down criminals matching the killer's description. He creates a mask and [[spandex]] suit to hide his identity. He also builds mechanical web-shooters out of [[wristwatches]] to attach to his arms/wrists. At dinner with Gwen's family, he discovers her father is police captain [[George Stacy]], who dislikes the new vigilante hero.\n\nPeter reveals his identity to Gwen and they kiss. After seeing success with the lab rats using lizard DNA, Connors' superior Ratha demands Connors begin human trials immediately. Connors refuses to rush the drug-testing procedure and put innocent people at risk. Ratha fires Connors and decides to test his serum at a [[Veterans Administration]] hospital. In an act of desperation, Connors tries the formula on himself. After passing out, he awakens to find his missing arm has regenerated. Discovering that Ratha is on his way to the hospital, Connors goes to intercept him. By the time he gets to the [[Williamsburg Bridge]], he has become a violent humanoid reptile. Peter, now calling himself Spider-Man, saves the people on the bridge from Connors' attack. Following a battle in the [[Sewerage|sewer]], the Lizard learns Spider-Man's real identity and attacks Peter at school. Police start a manhunt for both Spider-Man and the Lizard. They eventually corner Spider-Man, leading Captain Stacy to discover that Spider-Man is Peter and lets him go to stop the Lizard. The Lizard plans to make all humans reptilian by releasing a chemical cloud from Oscorp's tower, to eliminate the weaknesses he believes plague humanity.\n\nGwen creates an antidote, which Peter disperses, restoring Connors and his victims to normal, but not before the Lizard fatally wounds Captain Stacy. Before his death, Captain Stacy asks that Peter avoid Gwen to keep her safe. Peter initially does so, but seeing as they're both unhappy, hints to her that he may see her after all.\n\nIn a [[post-credits scene|mid-credits scene]], an incarcerated Connors speaks with a [[Gentleman (character)|man in the shadows]] who asks if Peter knows the truth about his father. Connors does not know and demands that Peter be left alone, before the man disappears.{{efn|Ifans said of the scene, \"Connors is sent to an asylum, a high-security asylum...
