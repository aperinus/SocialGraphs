It stars [[Matthew Modine]], [[Catherine Keener]], and [[Maxwell Caulfield]]. The film is a [[satire (film and television)|satire]] on [[New York City|New York's]] [[fashion]] and [[entertainment industry|entertainment industries]].\n\n==Plot==\nJoe is an aspiring actor working as a bus boy in a high-class restaurant. His longtime girlfriend Mary works as a cosmetician for the fashion industry and largely supports him with her steady income. Joe is more concerned with expressing himself than getting a paying job, and has been unwilling to accept roles that do not live up to his artistic standard. Mary supports Joe, but urges him to accept any role to get his foot in the door. Meanwhile, his co-worker Bob lands a lucrative role on a [[soap opera]]. Bob is a classically trained actor, but is willing to overlook the quality of the material for the money. He also has a fetish for natural blonde women, leading him to date Sahara, a naive model, and then dump her after discovering that her hair is dyed.\n\nJoe swallows his artistic pride and meets with an agent, Dee Dee Taylor, who arranges for him to be an extra in a [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] [[music video|video]]. Mary is harassed as she walks to work each day and begins taking a self-defense and anger management class on the advice of her therapist. The instructor encourages her to express her anger, and she finds the class extremely empowering. Bob is successful in his soap opera role and begins a relationship with his beautiful co-star Kelly, a \"real blonde\".\n\nAt the Madonna video, the director treats Joe and the other extras like cattle. Joe meets Madonna's body double, Tina, a friendly aspiring actress, and gets himself fired for protesting an [[Holocaust denial|anti-Semitic statement]] made by the assistant director. Joe's firing sparks an argument between Joe and Mary. The pressure of Joe's career is straining their relationship, and they have not had sex in a long time. Mary's instructor, Doug, gives her a ride home from her class and makes a pass at her. She rebuffs him, but lies to cover up the incident to Joe. Meanwhile, Bob suffers from [[erectile dysfunction]] and is unable to have sex with Kelly. She mocks his inadequacy and leaves him.\n\nDee Dee takes pity on Joe and allows him to audition for the role of a \"sexy [[serial killer]]\". He reads his lines with Tina and begins to improvise his dialogue. He impresses the producers and lands the role. Tina invites him out for a drink and he resists her advances with some difficulty. Mary meets with her therapist and tells him about her experience with her self-defense instructor. He tells her that she must become comfortable with men showing their attraction to her and begins sharing his own sexual fantasies about her. She storms out of the session. Meanwhile, Bob is negotiating a longtime contract on the soap opera, but Kelly continues to taunt him on set. Bob threatens to quit the show and then forces the producer to kill off Kelly's character.\n\nBob goes back to dating Sahara, with whom he is miserable. Joe breaks the big news about his role to Mary and they rejoice. Mary asks him if she is wrong for feeling angry when men hit on her. Joe supports her and threatens to beat up her therapist if he ever sees him again. They have sex for the first time in months and drift off to sleep, happy and satisfied. Mary wraps her hand around Joe's finger, revealing that his improvised monologue had been about his feelings for her.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Matthew Modine]] as Joe, an aspiring actor with strong opinions\n*[[Catherine Keener]] as Mary, Joe's longtime girlfriend and a successful makeup artist\n*[[Maxwell Caulfield]] as Bob, an actor with a fetish for natural blondes\n*[[Daryl Hannah]] as Kelly, a blonde soap-opera star \n*[[Bridgette Wilson]] as Sahara, a naive model with dyed blonde hair\n*[[Marlo Thomas]] as Blair, a fashion photographer and Mary's boss\n*[[Kathleen Turner]] as Dee Dee Taylor, a prominent talent agent\n*[[Elizabeth Berkley]] as Tina, an aspiring actress who works as Madonna's double.\n*[[Denis Leary]] as Doug, Mary's self-defense instructor\n*[[Steve Buscemi]] as Nick, the director for Madonna's video\n*[[Dave Chappelle]] as Zee, the assistant director for Madonna's video\n*[[Christopher Lloyd]] as Ernst, a head waiter and Joe's boss\n*[[Beatrice Winde]] as Wilma\n\n==Reception==\nThe movie received mixed reviews from critics and currently holds a 34% approval rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]], with an average score of 5.4.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_real_blonde/?search=the%20real%20blon|title=The Real Blonde:: Reviews |publisher=Rotten Tomatoes|date= |access-date=2015-06-21}}</ref>\n\n''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' film critic [[Roger Ebert]] gave the film 3 out of 4 stars, and wrote:<blockquote>[Director/writer DiCillo] devises brief, sharply observed scenes. He notices, for example, the way a makeup artist makes up not only a model's face but also her attitude. The way the karate instructor, playing an aggressor, takes a sly pleasure in using sexist insults. The way people talk knowledgeably about movies they haven't seen. The way a guy who's embarrassed to be in a porno store will brazen it out. All of the actors are right for their roles because a degree of typecasting has been done, but Daryl Hannah brings a particularly focused energy to the role of a soap opera actress who is not impressed that a guy is impressed by her. And Catherine Keener brings a wry wit to her character; she sees models on Times Square billboards and knows what it took to get them there.<p>The characters are articulate enough to talk about what really moves them; they don't play sitcom games. DiCillo never puts two and two together, but somehow it all adds up.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/the-real-blonde-1998|title=The Real Blonde|author=[[Roger Ebert]]|website=RogerEbert.com|publisher=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]|date=February 27, 1998}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n[[Owen Gleiberman]] of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' awarded it a C+, commenting \"the movie, an attack on superficiality, never quite makes it out of the shallow end.\"<ref>{{cite magazine | url=https://ew.com/article/1998/03/06/real-blonde/ | title=The Real Blonde | magazine=[[Entertainment Weekly]] }}</ref> Marc Savlov of  ''[[The Austin Chronicle]]'' labelled it a \"very crowded movie that babbles endlessly without ever saying very much.\"<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.austinchronicle.com/events/film/1998-05-29/the-real-blonde/ | title=Movie Review: The Real Blonde }}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|id=0119987|title=The Real Blonde}}\n* {{amg title|id=158733|title=The Real Blonde}}\n* {{tcmdb title|443802|The Real Blonde}}\n* {{rotten-tomatoes|real_blonde|The Real Blonde}}\n* {{Mojo title|realblonde|The Real Blonde}}\n\n{{Tom DiCillo}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Real Blonde, The}}\n[[Category:1997 films]]\n[[Category:1997 comedy films]]\n[[Category:American comedy films]]\n[[Category:American satirical films]]\n[[Category:Films about actors]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Tom DiCillo]]\n[[Category:Films produced by Tom Rosenberg]]\n[[Category:Films set in New York City]]\n[[Category:Films shot in New York City]]\n[[Category:Lakeshore Entertainment films]]\n[[Category:Paramount Pictures films]]\n[[Category:1990s English-language films]]\n[[Category:1990s American films]]"}]}}}}
