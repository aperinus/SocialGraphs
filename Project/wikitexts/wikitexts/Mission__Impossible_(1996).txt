A continuation of [[Mission: Impossible (1966 TV series)|the 1966 television series of the same name]] and its [[Mission: Impossible (1988 TV series)|1988 sequel series]] ([[Canon (fiction)|canon]]ically set six years after the latter), it is the first installment in the [[Mission: Impossible (film series)|''Mission: Impossible'' film series]]. It also stars [[Jon Voight]], [[Emmanuelle B\u00e9art]], [[Henry Czerny]], [[Ving Rhames]], [[Kristin Scott Thomas]], [[Vanessa Redgrave]], and [[Jean Reno]]. In ''Mission: Impossible'', [[Ethan Hunt]] (Cruise) seeks to uncover who framed him for the murders of most of his [[Impossible Missions Force]] (IMF) team.\n\nNumerous efforts by [[Paramount Pictures]] to create a film adaptation of the television series stalled until Cruise founded [[Cruise/Wagner Productions]] and decided on ''Mission: Impossible'' as its inaugural project. Development initially began with filmmaker [[Sydney Pollack]] but most of the final screenplay was complete after De Palma, [[Steven Zaillian]], [[David Koepp]], and [[Robert Towne]] were hired; De Palma also designed most of the action sequences, while Cruise did most of his own stunts. [[Principal photography]] began in March 1995 and had lasted until that August, with filming locations including [[London]], [[Pinewood Studios]] in England, and [[Prague]] (a rarity in Hollywood at the time).\n\n''Mission: Impossible'' was theatrically released in the United States by Paramount on May 22, 1996. The film received generally mixed to positive reviews from critics, with praise for the action sequences, De Palma\u2019s direction and Cruise's performance but criticism for the convoluted plot; cast members of the original television series negatively received the film. The film grossed $457.7 million worldwide, making it the [[1996 in film|third highest-grossing film of 1996]], while the dance rendition of the [[Theme from Mission: Impossible|original theme song]] by [[Larry Mullen Jr.]] and [[Adam Clayton]] became a top-ten hit internationally and was nominated for the [[Grammy Award for Best Pop Instrumental Performance]]. The sequel, ''[[Mission: Impossible 2]]'', was released in 2000.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for featured films should be between 400 and 700 words. -->\nAfter finishing a mission in [[Kyiv|Kiev]], [[Jim Phelps]] and his latest [[Impossible Missions Force|IMF]] team are sent to [[Prague]] to stop rogue agent Alexander Golitsyn from stealing the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] [[non-official cover|NOC]] list. However, the mission unexpectedly fails after the list is stolen and the team is killed one by one, along with Golitsyn, leaving Phelps's pointman [[Ethan Hunt]] the only survivor.\n\nHunt is debriefed by IMF director Eugene Kittridge in a restaurant. Hunt realizes that another IMF team was present during the mission and learns that the operation was a setup to lure out a [[Mole (espionage)|mole]] within the IMF. The mole is believed to be working with an arms dealer named \"Max\" as part of \"Job 314\". Hunt, realizing that Kittridge suspects him of being the mole, escapes by using exploding chewing gum given to him by another agent before the mission.\n\nAfter returning to the Prague safe house, Hunt realizes \"Job 314\" actually refers to Bible verse [[Book of Job|Job]] {{bibleverse-nb|Job|3:14|9}}, \"Job\" being the mole's code name. Phelps's wife Claire, thought to have been killed during the mission, arrives at the safe house, explaining that before his death, Phelps contacted her saying that the mission was compromised, which enabled her to avoid getting killed. Hunt arranges a meeting with Max to warn her that the NOC list she has is fake and equipped with a tracking device. After Max realizes that Hunt was telling the truth, they escape together just as Kittridge and the other IMF team, following the tracking device, raid her apartment. Hunt convinces Max that he can obtain the real NOC list in exchange for $10 million and Job's true identity.\n\nHunt and Claire recruit two disavowed IMF agents, hacker [[Luther Stickell]] and helicopter pilot Franz Krieger. They infiltrate [[George Bush Center for Intelligence|CIA headquarters]] in [[Langley, Virginia|Langley]], steal the authentic list, and escape to London. Krieger takes the floppy disk containing the list, but Hunt tricks him into giving the list up. Hunt then gives the list to Stickell. Kittridge has Hunt's mother and uncle falsely arrested for drug trafficking in order to lure Hunt into surrendering. After learning about their arrests, Hunt contacts Kittridge from a payphone, intentionally allowing the IMF to trace the call. Phelps resurfaces unexpectedly, recounts surviving the shooting, and tells Hunt that Kittridge is the mole. However, Hunt deduces that Phelps is the mole after realizing that the Bible he found in Prague was taken from [[Chicago]]'s [[Drake Hotel (Chicago)|Drake Hotel]] by Phelps. Hunt pretends to believe Phelps but pieces together how he betrayed and killed his teammates with help from Krieger and possibly Claire. Hunt arranges to exchange the list with Max aboard the [[TGV]] train to Paris, secretly inviting Kittridge to the meeting.\n\nOn the train, Hunt directs Max to the list, and she sends him to the baggage car where the money and Job are located. Meanwhile, Stickell uses a jamming device to prevent Max from uploading the list to her servers. Claire goes to the car to collect her share of the money from Phelps, only to realize that he is really Ethan in disguise. When the real Phelps arrives and takes the money at gunpoint, Hunt sends a live video of Phelps to Kittridge, exposing him as the mole. Claire tries to talk her husband into surrendering, but Phelps kills her and climbs to the train's roof, where Krieger is waiting with a helicopter. As Phelps attempts to climb onto the helicopter using a tether, Hunt hooks it onto the train, preventing Krieger from flying away and forcing the helicopter into the [[Channel Tunnel]]. He uses another piece of exploding chewing gum to blow the chopper up, killing both men. Kittridge takes Max into custody and recovers the NOC list from Stickell. As he and Stickell are reinstated back in the IMF, Hunt is unsure about returning to the team. On the flight home, an attendant approaches him and asks, through a coded phrase, if he is ready to take on a new mission and that he has been promoted as team leader due to his actions during the crisis.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Tom Cruise]] as [[Ethan Hunt]], a young, inexperienced agent of the Impossible Missions Force (IMF) and protagonist of the film.\n* [[Jon Voight]] as [[Jim Phelps]]/Job 314, Hunt's mentor and a veteran who is secretly a mole working for Max.\n* [[Emmanuelle B\u00e9art]] as Claire Phelps, Phelps' wife and an IMF agent who works alongside Ethan, but conspires with her husband to steal the NOC list.\n* [[Ving Rhames]] as [[Luther Stickell]], a disavowed IMF agent and skilled computer hacker recruited by Ethan to assist him.\n* [[Vanessa Redgrave]] as Max, an illegal arms dealer and Job's contact.\n* [[Henry Czerny]] as Eugene Kittridge, director of IMF.\n* [[Jean Reno]] as Franz Krieger, a disavowed IMF agent and skilled pilot recruited by Ethan to assist him, but works secretly with Phelps.\n* [[Kristin Scott Thomas]] as Sarah Davies, an IMF agent and Ethan's partner who is a surveillance expert.\n* [[Emilio Estevez]] as Jack Harmon, an IMF agent and equipment technician assigned to Phelps' team. \n* [[Ingeborga Dapk\u016bnait\u0117]] as Hannah Williams, an IMF agent and field operative assigned to Phelps' team.\n* [[Rolf Saxon]] as William Donloe, a CIA analyst at Langley.\n* [[Marcel Iure\u015f]] as Alexander Golitsyn, a rogue IMF agent hired to steal the NOC list by Job.\n* [[Karel Dobr\u00fd]] as Max's henchman\n* [[Andreas Wisniewski]] as Max's henchman\n* [[Annabel Mullion]] as an IMF agent posing as the flight attendant on Ethan's plane.\n* [[Olegar Fedoro]] as an IMF agent during the Kiev sequence.\n* [[Morgan Deare]] as Donald Hunt, Ethan's uncle who is falsely arrested in an attempt to lure him out.\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development and writing===\n[[Paramount Pictures]] owned the rights to the television series and had tried for years to make a film version but had failed to come up with a viable treatment.
