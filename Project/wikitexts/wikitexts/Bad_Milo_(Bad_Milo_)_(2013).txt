One day, he schedules an appointment with a [[gastroenterologist]] after experiencing a rather serious level of gastric stress the night before. During the appointment, the doctor and nurse spot a large \"[[Polyp (medicine)|polyp]]\" in his intestinal tract. After seeing a large amount of stress at a very fast pace from work with his boss placing him in charge of firing employees, where a man his age is in a relationship with his mother, and his wife is making him see a very eccentric therapist who keeps asking about his father issues, something unusual happens. The polyp forms into a 2-foot-tall sentient being, and begins killing each person the creature sees as a source of stress with each day. The local news reports the attacks as having been committed by a rabid racoon.\n\nDuncan's [[therapist]] informs him that the creature is the living manifestation of his life's stress built up over time, and that mythology of this type of being states that the best way to eliminate it is to bond with it so it doesn't act so irrationally. In an effort to bond with it, Duncan names this strange anal-dwelling creature Milo.\n\nFirst, Milo kills his co-worker, then the E.D. doctor he didn't need, yet who wouldn't stop calling him. Soon enough, Milo kills Duncan's boss in an elevator during an investigation by the [[FBI]] at his office building. When it finally attacks his father, who apparently had a being of the same species, and begins killing the other being, Duncan loses his grip and moves Milo and himself to a hotel room far away and someplace safe. This doesn't work, much as it seems to at the outset and Milo tracks Sarah down to her house party where a violent battle ensues between Duncan and Milo. Ultimately Duncan dismembers Milo's left arm and legs, and finally saves its life, vowing to never ignore Milo's important influence and make amends with Milo, successfully doing so before Sarah reinserts Milo back up his anus.\n\nUltimately Milo's bloodline is discovered to be carried on through Duncan's unborn son, the embryo of the new creature being seen in the system of the unborn fetus.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Ken Marino]] as Duncan\n* [[Gillian Jacobs]] as Sarah\n* [[Stephen Root]] as Roger\n* [[Peter Stormare]] as Highsmith\n* [[Mary Kay Place]] as Beatrice\n* [[Patrick Warburton]] as Phil\n* [[Kumail Nanjiani]] as Bobbi\n* Michael Penfold as the Goblin\n\n==Release==\nThe film had its world premiere at the [[SXSW]] film festival on March 10, 2013.<ref name=\"johndefore\"/> Shortly after it was announced [[Magnet Releasing]] had acquired distribution rights to the film.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://hollywoodreporter.com/news/sxsw-magnet-picks-up-horror-429452|title=SXSW: Magnet Picks Up Horror/Comedy 'Milo,' About a Murderous Demon|author=Gregg Kilday|work=The Hollywood Reporter|accessdate=October 31, 2015}}</ref> The film went on to screen at the [[Karlovy Vary Film Festival]] on June 29, 2013.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fantasiafestival.com/2013/en/films-schedule/52/bad-milo|title=Bad Milo|publisher=|accessdate=October 31, 2015}}</ref> The film was released on August 29, 2013, through [[video on demand]], before being released in a [[limited release]] on October 4, 2013.<ref name=\"filmindependent.org\"/>\n\n==Reception==\nThe film holds a 58% rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on 36 reviews; the consensus states: \"''Bad Milo!'' sets some deliriously low expectations with its gross premise \u2013 and then manages to match most of them in sick, entertaining style.\"<ref>{{cite web | url=https://rottentomatoes.com/m/bad_milo/ | title=Bad Milo! | work=Rotten Tomatoes | publisher=[[Flixster]] | accessdate=February 27, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|2274570|Bad Milo!}}\n*{{ Official website|http://www.magnetreleasing.com/badmilo/}}\n\n[[Category:2013 films]]\n[[Category:2013 horror films]]\n[[Category:2013 comedy horror films]]\n[[Category:2010s monster movies]]\n[[Category:American comedy horror films]]\n[[Category:American monster movies]]\n[[Category:Duplass Brothers Productions films]]\n[[Category:2013 comedy films]]\n[[Category:2010s English-language films]]\n[[Category:2010s American films]]"}]}}}}
