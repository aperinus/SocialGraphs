It is a remake of the 1986 [[About Last Night (1986 film)|film of the same name]]; both films are based on the 1974 [[David Mamet]] play ''[[Sexual Perversity in Chicago]]''. The remake, featuring a predominantly Black cast, is directed by [[Steve Pink]] and written by [[Leslye Headland]]. It tells the story of Danny (Ealy) and Debbie (Bryant), and Bernie (Hart) and Joan (Hall), two couples who test how their relationships work in the real world.\n\nWhile the original film is set in [[Chicago, Illinois]], the remake is set in [[Los Angeles, California]] where filming took place in late 2012. It was produced on a budget of {{nowrap|$13 million}}. The film premiered at the [[Pan African Film Festival]] on {{nowrap|February 11}}, 2014 and was released in theaters on [[Valentine's Day]], {{nowrap|February 14}}, 2014. The film received generally positive reviews, with most critics praising the humor between Hart and Hall. The film grossed $50 million at the box office.\n\n==Plot==\n\nDanny is a salesman working in the restaurant supply business along with his friend, [[Lothario|ladies' man]] Bernie. Bernie invites Danny on a [[double date]], where he meets Debbie, a friend of Joan, Bernie's latest sexual partner. He is still pining over his ex-girlfriend Alison, but begins a relationship with Debbie. They have a more conventional romance, while Bernie and Joan are constantly antagonistic towards each other, and eventually mutually end their relationship.\n\nSeveral months later, Danny and Debbie move in together. Bernie regularly mocks Danny about his relationship, accusing him of being emasculated and under Debbie's control. Danny and Debbie begin to argue more frequently about a variety of topics, but particularly about Danny's apparent lack of commitment to their relationship. He is fired from his job for extending credit to bar owner Casey, and begins working at Casey's as a bartender.\n\nWhile working, Danny is surprised by Alison. After she gets too drunk and refuses to go to her own home, Danny brings her to his apartment, where she flirts with him. The same night, Debbie, who is on a business trip, is propositioned by her coworker and ex Steven; both reject their exes.\n\nAfter another argument at a New Year\u2019s Eve party, Debbie breaks up with Danny and moves out. Both of them continue to be emotionally affected by their relationship, and have difficulty being with other people. Meanwhile, Bernie and Joan rekindle their relationship, based on their mutual enjoyment of antagonizing each other. Danny calls Debbie hoping to meet up, but is rejected.\n\nBernie and Joan's relationship continues to grow, eventually leading them to move in together, despite both of them having had discouraged Danny and Debbie from moving in while together. Walking the dog that he and Debbie got as a couple, he runs into her, they having been set up to run into each other by Bernie and Joan. They talk and agree to give their relationship another chance.\n\n==Cast==\n\nThe film features the following actors:<ref>{{cite journal | last=Labuza | first=Peter | url=https://variety.com/2014/film/reviews/film-review-about-last-night-1201100328/ | title=Film Review: 'About Last Night' | journal=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date=February 13, 2014 }}</ref>\n{| style=\"width: 60%\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" style=\"width: 250px;\" |\n'''Main cast'''\n* [[Kevin Hart]] as Bernie\n* [[Michael Ealy]] as Danny\n* [[Regina Hall]] as Joan\n* [[Joy Bryant]] as Debbie\n| valign=\"top\" |\n'''Supporting cast'''\n* [[Christopher McDonald]] as Casey McNeil\n* [[Adam Rodr\u00edguez]] as Steven Thaler\n* [[Joe Lo Truglio]] as Ryan Keller\n* [[Paula Patton]] as Alison\n\n|}\n\nHart was cast in June 2012.<ref name=\"siegel\" /> In the following July, Ealy and Hall joined the cast.<ref>{{cite journal | last=Sneider | first=Jeff | url=https://variety.com/2012/film/news/michael-ealy-regina-hall-think-about-last-night-1118057116/ | title=Michael Ealy, Regina Hall think 'About Last Night' | journal=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date=July 26, 2012 }}</ref> Hart, Hall, and Ealy had previously starred together in the romantic comedy ''[[Think Like a Man]]'' (2012), which ''About Last Night''{{'}}s producer [[Will Packer]] also produced.<ref name=\"mccabe\" /> [[Joy Bryant]] was cast in August to round out the four key roles.<ref>{{cite journal | last=Kit | first=Borys | url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/parenthood-joy-bryant-about-last-night-remake-362800 | title='Parenthood' Star Joins 'About Last Night' Remake | journal=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] | date=August 15, 2012 }}</ref> In addition to McDonald, Rodr\u00edguez, Lo Truglio, and Patton making up the supporting cast, American football player [[Terrell Owens]] had a cameo appearance in the film.<ref>{{cite news | last=Mucha | first=Peter | url=http://www.philly.com/philly/sports/eagles/Before_his_roast_Terrell_Owens_talks_fans_Reid_McNabb_Super_Bowl_.html | title=Before his roast, Terrell Owens talks fans, Reid, McNabb, Super Bowl | work=Philly.com | date=February 20, 2014 | accessdate=May 2, 2014 }}</ref>\n\nHart and Hall played the characters that [[James Belushi]] and [[Elizabeth Perkins]] played in the original film.<ref name=\"mccabe\">{{cite news | last=McCabe | first=Joseph | url=http://www.comingsoon.net/news/movienews.php?id=109075 | title=From the Set of Steve Pink's About Last Night | work=ComingSoon.net | publisher=CraveOnline Media | date=September 23, 2013 | accessdate=February 9, 2014 }}</ref> While the character Joan was not very likable in the original film, Hall said the writers revised the character to be closer to the one depicted in the play.

The production did not qualify for a California film tax credit, but executives intended to film in Los Angeles regardless. The crew filmed in downtown Los Angeles, not traditionally depicted in films as a people-friendly community. The downtown area had been revitalized in recent years, and the crew chose to film most of ''About Last Night'' in a 10-block radius around 6th and Main Streets. Most films are filmed in different locations not near each other, so the setup for ''About Last Night'' was unconventional but helped minimize transportation costs. Filming locations in the area included [[Pacific Electric Building]], [[Cole's Pacific Electric Buffet]], Santa Fe Lofts, Casey's Irish Pub, and Broadway Bar. The crew's location manager approached the owner of the local businesses to depict their properties as-is and benefit from publicity in exchange for lower rental fees for use of the space. [[Dodger Stadium]] was the sole filming location outside of the radius. Filming lasted for seven weeks in late 2012, and production was completed with a budget of {{nowrap|$13 million}}.<ref name=\"verrier\">{{cite news | last=Verrier | first=Richard | url=http://www.latimes.com/business/la-et-ct-onlocation-downtown-la-20140205,0,3213674.story | title=A movie Valentine to downtown L.A. | work=[[Los Angeles Times]] | date=February 5, 2014 | accessdate=February 5, 2014 }}</ref>\n\n==Release==\n\n===Theatrical run===\n\n''About Last Night'' premiered at the [[Pan African Film Festival]] on {{nowrap|February 11}}, 2014 as the festival's centerpiece film.<ref>{{cite news | last=Obenson | first=Tambay A. | url=http://blogs.indiewire.com/shadowandact/about-last-night-will-world-premiere-at-pan-african-film-fest-as-centerpiece-film-see-full-lineup | title='About Last Night' Will World Premiere At Pan African Film Fest As Centerpiece Film | work=Shadow and Act | publisher=[[IndieWire]] | date=January 8, 2014 | accessdate=January 24, 2014 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140116110753/http://blogs.indiewire.com/shadowandact/about-last-night-will-world-premiere-at-pan-african-film-fest-as-centerpiece-film-see-full-lineup | archive-date=January 16, 2014 | url-status=dead }}</ref> It was released in {{nowrap|2,253 theaters}} in the United States and Canada on [[Valentine's Day]], {{nowrap|February 14}}, 2014.<ref name=\"subers\">{{cite news | last=Subers | first=Ray | url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/news/?id=3784&p=.htm | title=Forecast: 80s Remakes Battle Over President's Day Weekend | website=[[Box Office Mojo]] | date=February 13, 2014 | accessdate=February 15, 2014 }}</ref> The film grossed {{nowrap|$25.6 million}} over the opening weekend (not including the holiday [[Washington's Birthday]] on Monday).<ref name=\"bom\">{{cite web | url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=aboutlastnight14.htm | title=About Last Night (2014) | website=[[Box Office Mojo]] | accessdate=May 2, 2014 }}</ref> It ranked second after ''[[The Lego Movie]]'', which was in its second weekend and grossed {{nowrap|$49.8 million}}.
