It tells the story of two Japanese high school students who attempt to break into the competitive world of [[manga]]. ''Bakuman'' was produced by Minami Ichikawa, with music by the band [[Sakanaction]], and distributed by [[Toho]]. The film stars [[Takeru Satoh]], [[Ry\u016bnosuke Kamiki]], [[Shota Sometani]], [[Nana Komatsu]], [[Kenta Kiritani]], and [[Hirofumi Arai]].\n\n''Bakuman'' opened at number one at the Japanese box office on October 3, 2015, and has grossed over $13 million. It was nominated for several awards, winning Best Picture at the 25th [[Japanese Professional Movie Awards]]. It also earned \u014cne Best Director at the 35th [[Japanese Movie Critics Awards]] and Yasuyuki \u014czeki the [[Japan Academy Prize for Best Film Editing]].\n\n==Plot==\nHigh school classmates [[Moritaka Mashiro]] and [[Akito Takagi (Bakuman)|Akito Takagi]], one an illustrator, the other a writer, decide to team up to create a successful [[manga]] series. Moritaka desires to impress his crush, [[Miho Azuki]], with whom he makes a promise to have voice a character in the [[anime]] adaptation of one of his works and marry once he has a successful manga. Mashiro and Takagi successfully pitch a manga to ''[[Weekly Sh\u014dnen Jump]]'', the biggest manga magazine in Japan, which wins second place at the [[Tezuka Award]]s. The two make friends with [[Shinta Fukuda]], [[Kazuya Hiramaru]], and [[Takuro Nakai]], three manga creators who also entered the competition. But, it is fellow high school student [[Eiji Nizuma]] who bests them in the competition and becomes their rival.\n\nShortly following the other four, Mashiro and Takagi eventually get serialized in ''Weekly Sh\u014dnen Jump''. Under the wing of their editor [[Akira Hattori]], the two vow to beat Eiji and be the first to get to the top spot in the magazine's readers' ranking. When Mashiro has a health issue, ''Weekly Sh\u014dnen Jump'' editor-in-chief [[Hisashi Sasaki (Bakuman)|Sasaki]] decides to put their manga on hiatus until they graduate. However, with the help of their friends, Mashiro and Takagi create a chapter that not only has Sasaki change his mind, but also reaches number one in the rankings. However, their manga is cancelled shortly after. The film ends on Mashiro and Takagi's last day of high school, with the two enthusiastically discussing plans for their next manga.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Takeru Satoh]] as [[Moritaka Mashiro]]\n*[[Ry\u016bnosuke Kamiki]] as [[Akito Takagi (Bakuman)|Akito Takagi]]\n*[[Shota Sometani]] as [[Eiji Nizuma]], a high school manga artist who is considered a genius.\n*[[Nana Komatsu]] as [[Miho Azuki]], Mashiro's school crush who dreams of becoming a [[Voice acting in Japan|voice actress]].\n*[[Kenta Kiritani]] as [[Shinta Fukuda]]\n*[[Hirofumi Arai]] as [[Kazuya Hiramaru]]\n*[[Sarutoki Minagawa]] as [[Takuro Nakai]]\n*[[Kankur\u014d Kud\u014d]] as Taro Kawaguchi, Mashiro's uncle and the manga artist of ''Bakuman'', who died several years earlier due to overwork.\n*[[Takayuki Yamada]] as [[Akira Hattori]], an editor at ''Weekly Sh\u014dnen Jump'' who takes on Mashiro and Takagi.\n*[[Lily Franky]] as [[Hisashi Sasaki (Bakuman)|Sasaki]], editor-in-chief of ''Weekly Sh\u014dnen Jump''. He was Taro Kawaguchi's editor on ''Bakuman''.\n\n==Production==\nDirector and screenwriter Hitoshi \u014cne initially turned down the offer to adapt ''[[Bakuman]]'' to live-action film. He felt that the meta-aspect of a ''Weekly Sh\u014dnen Jump'' manga about ''Weekly Sh\u014dnen Jump'' manga would be lost in another medium. But after re-reading the series, he realized it is a [[coming-of-age story]] at heart and changed his mind. He also liked how there were many homages to [[Fujiko A. Fujio]]'s ''Manga Michi'', a personal favorite of his.<ref name=\"nat2\">{{cite web|url=https://natalie.mu/comic/pp/bakuman_eiga02|title=\u6620\u753b\u300c\u30d0\u30af\u30de\u30f3\u3002\u300d\u7279\u96c6 \u5c0f\u7551\u5065\u00d7\u5927\u6839\u4ec1\u5bfe\u8ac7|language=ja|publisher=[[Natalie (website)|Natalie]]|date=2015-09-25|access-date=2022-06-26}}</ref> \u014cne wanted ''Bakuman'' to be a story about \"friendship, effort, and victory\", the motto of ''Weekly Sh\u014dnen Jump'', and a buddy story between two men, but to also have a team feel.<ref name=\"nat1\">{{cite web|url=https://natalie.mu/eiga/pp/bakuman_eiga01|title=\u6620\u753b\u300c\u30d0\u30af\u30de\u30f3\u3002\u300d\u7279\u96c6 \u5927\u6839\u4ec1\u00d7\u4f50\u85e4\u5065\u00d7\u795e\u6728\u9686\u4e4b\u4ecb|language=ja|publisher=[[Natalie (website)|Natalie]]|date=2015-09-18|access-date=2022-06-26}}</ref> While writing the screenplay, he interviewed the ''Weekly Sh\u014dnen Jump'' editorial department and many manga artists, including [[Takeshi Obata]], illustrator of the original ''Bakuman'' manga. Obata drew some of the manga manuscripts seen in the film, as well as the images that appear on the blackboard in the final scene.<ref name=\"nat2\"/> The ''Weekly Sh\u014dnen Jump'' editorial office seen in the film is a faithful recreation of the magazine's actual editorial office.<ref name=\"nat3\">{{cite web|url=https://natalie.mu/music/pp/bakuman_eiga04|title= \u6620\u753b\u300c\u30d0\u30af\u30de\u30f3\u3002\u300d\u7279\u96c6 \u5c71\u53e3\u4e00\u90ce\uff08\u30b5\u30ab\u30ca\u30af\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\uff09\u00d7\u5927\u6839\u4ec1\u5bfe\u8ac7|language=ja|publisher=[[Natalie (website)|Natalie]]|date=2015-10-02|access-date=2022-06-26}}</ref>\n\n\u014cne said that while writing the script was difficult, having done over 20 drafts, preparing for and casting the film went smoothly.<ref name=\"nat2\"/><ref name=\"nat1\"/> When the cast was revealed, many people felt that [[Takeru Satoh]] and [[Ry\u016bnosuke Kamiki]] should have been cast in each other's role. The actors themselves were also initially surprised when they were first given their roles. But \u014cne decided from the beginning that \"manga ''[[otaku]]''\" Kamiki was more likely to think up a manga story, while the stoic Satoh would be able to show his heart honestly, and the actors eventually felt it was the right decision as well. Wanting someone who could draw for the part of Taro Kawaguchi, \u014cne saw [[Kankur\u014d Kud\u014d]] portray [[Shigeru Mizuki]] in ''[[GeGeGe no Ny\u014db\u014d]]'' and knew he could pull it off.<ref name=\"nat1\"/> \u014cne said of all the manga adaptations he has made, Eiji Nizuma might have been the most difficult character to portray. Due to the time restraint, Nizuma is more of a rival to Mashiro and Takagi in the film, compared to the manga where he becomes their friend too. Akira Hattori also differs from his manga counterpart, with \u014cne describing him as a mix of the original character and Monji, the real-life second editor of the ''Bakuman'' manga.<ref name=\"nat2\"/>\n\nSatoh practiced using a G-pen [[Nib (pen)|nib]] about two months before shooting began. The film has an action scene where Mashiro and Takagi \"battle\" Nizuma with large pens and pencils as swords. Satoh and Kamiki said their experience working opposite one another on ''[[Rurouni Kenshin: Kyoto Inferno]]'' and ''[[Rurouni Kenshin: The Legend Ends]]'' made it so that they were comfortable with each other in the fight scene. Satoh and Kamiki ''[[ad lib]]bed'' some of the parts in the film, such as the lines their characters make discussing what kind of manga they want to create when they initially team up, and Takagi's reference to ''[[Ky\u016bkyoku!! Hentai Kamen]]''.<ref name=\"nat1\"/> The scene where the manga artists gather after the award ceremony is an homage to a similar scene in ''Tokiwa-s\u014d no Seishun'', a 1996 film about [[Tokiwa-s\u014d]].<ref name=\"nat2\"/>\n\n==Soundtrack==\n{{Main|Motion Music of Bakuman}}\nThe soundtrack was written and performed by Japanese band [[Sakanaction]], including the theme song \"[[Shin Takarajima (song)|Shin Takarajima]]\", which they released as a single four days before the film's release.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://natalie.mu/music/news/155945|title=\u30b5\u30ab\u30ca\u30af\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u300c\u30d0\u30af\u30de\u30f3\u3002\u300d\u4e3b\u984c\u6b4c\u30b7\u30f3\u30b0\u30eb\u9650\u5b9a\u76e4\u306b\u5287\u4f34CD|publisher=[[Natalie (website)|Natalie]]|lang=ja|date=2015-08-04|accessdate=2021-07-24}}</ref> \u014cne decides who he wants to provide the music to his films before he starts writing the script or thinking about the cast.<ref name=\"nat3\"/> He feels that professional film composers are not suitable for his work, and prefers to hire actual artists for the job. Sakanaction were one of many acts he considered, saying he wanted to take advantage of their popularity. It was after seeing them perform live in 2012 that \u014cne decided to choose them for ''Bakuman''. Aware of \u014cne's reputation and work, being a particularly big fan of the [[Yura Yura Teikoku]] concert film ''Yura Yura Teikoku Live 2005-2009'', Sakanaction frontman [[Ichiro Yamaguchi]] said he felt that he and the director were both cut from the same cloth and was excited to work with him. After reading the script, Yamaguchi made and sent about 10 demos to \u014cne. The demos were then put to footage from the film and they discussed in detail changes to the music based on each scene. Unlike most films where the music is made to match the edited footage, \u014cne prefers to edit his films to the music. Yamaguchi said that Sakanaction had self-produced their music up to that point, so it was a new experience for them, as if they were working with a record producer.<ref name=\"nat3\"/>\n\n==Release==\nThe film was released in Japanese theaters on October 3, 2015 by [[Toho]].
