[[Jessica Walter]] and [[Donna Mills]] co-star. The screenplay, written by regular Eastwood collaborators [[Jo Heims]] and [[Dean Riesner]], follows a [[radio disc jockey]] (Eastwood) being stalked by an obsessed female fan (Walter).\n\nThe film was a critical and mild financial success, with Walter earning praise for her first major film role, earning a [[Golden Globe Awards|Golden Globe]] nomination for [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Motion Picture \u2013 Drama|Best Actress in a Motion Picture \u2013 Drama]].\n\n== Plot ==\nDave Garver is a [[KRML]] [[radio disc jockey]] who broadcasts nightly from a studio in [[Carmel-by-the-Sea, California]], often incorporating poetry into his program. After work at his favorite bar, playing a nonsensical game involving corks and bottle caps with the barman as a device, he deliberately attracts the attention of a woman named Evelyn Draper. Dave drives her home, where she reveals that her presence in the bar was not accidental; it was she in fact who sought him out after hearing the bar mentioned on his radio show. He guesses correctly that she is the recurring caller who always requests the jazz standard \"[[Misty (song)|Misty]].\" The two have sex.\n\nA casual relationship begins between Dave and Evelyn. But before long, Evelyn begins to display [[Fixation (psychology)|obsessive]] behavior. She shows up at Dave's house uninvited, follows him to work, and calls to demand that he not leave her alone for a single minute. The final straw comes when Evelyn disrupts a business meeting, mistaking Dave's lunch companion for his date.\n\nHis efforts to gently sever ties with Evelyn lead her to attempt suicide in his home by slashing her wrists. After Dave rejects her again, Evelyn breaks into his home and his housekeeper Birdie finds her vandalizing his possessions. Evelyn stabs the housekeeper (who is hospitalized but survives) and is subsequently committed to a [[psychiatric hospital]].\n\nDuring Evelyn's incarceration, Dave rekindles a relationship with his ex-girlfriend, Tobie Williams. A few months later, Evelyn again calls the studio to request \"Misty.\" She tells Dave that she has been released from the mental hospital and is moving to Hawaii for a fresh start in life. She then quotes an [[Edgar Allan Poe]] poem, \"[[Annabel Lee]].\" That night, while Dave is asleep, she sneaks into his house and tries to kill him with a large knife. He wakes up to see her standing over him wielding the knife, and as she screams and stabs downward, he rolls away from the descending knife (which plunges into his pillow) and he falls onto the floor; Evelyn flees, and he contacts the police.\n\nDave tells Tobie about Evelyn and cautions her to stay away from him until the woman is caught. For her safety, she goes home. There, she meets with a girl who answered her ad for a roommate: Evelyn, using the alias Annabel. Tobie eventually realizes that Annabel is Evelyn when she sees the fresh scars on Evelyn's wrists, but before Tobie can escape, Evelyn takes her hostage. Evelyn kills McCallum, a police detective who had come to check on Tobie.\n\nDave makes the connection between Tobie's roommate and the quote from \"Annabel Lee.\" When he calls Tobie to warn her, Evelyn answers and says she and Tobie are waiting for him. Dave switches from a live show to taped music and rushes to the house, where he finds Tobie bound and gagged. Evelyn attacks him with the butcher knife, slashing Dave multiple times. He punches Evelyn, knocking her through the window, over a railing, down onto the rocky shore below, killing her. He and Tobie leave the house as his voice on the radio show leads into the song \"Misty\".\n\n== Cast ==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Clint Eastwood]] as Dave Garver\n* [[Jessica Walter]] as Evelyn Draper\n* [[Donna Mills]] as Tobie Williams\n* [[John Larch]] as Sgt.

I stored away all the mistakes I made and saved up all the good things I learned, and now I know enough to control my own projects and get what I want out of actors.</blockquote>\n\nThe story line was originally set in Los Angeles, but at Eastwood's insistence, the film was shot in the more comfortable surroundings of the actual Carmel-by-the-Sea, where he could shoot scenes at the local radio station, bars and restaurants, and friends' houses.<ref name=\"McGilligan\"/>{{rp|193}} The idea of another love interest, with a level-headed girlfriend Tobie added to the plot, was a suggestion by Sonia Chernus, an editor who had been with Eastwood when he was initially spotted for ''[[Rawhide (TV series)|Rawhide]]''.<ref name=\"McGilligan\"/>{{rp|193}}\n\nFilming commenced in [[Monterey, California]], in September 1970, and although this was Eastwood's debut as film director, [[Don Siegel]] stood by to help and also had an acting role in the film as a bartender.
