She wants to race her friend Abdullah, a boy from her neighborhood, but riding bikes is frowned upon for girls and Wadjda's mother refuses to buy one for her. The bike is expensive, costing [[Saudi riyal|SR]]800 (~$213).\n\nWadjda begins to earn the money herself by selling [[mixtape]]s, hand-braiding [[bracelets]] for classmates, and acting as a [[go-between]] for an older student. These activities get her into trouble with the strict headmistress. Her mother, meanwhile, is dealing with a job that has a terrible commute with a driver who often gets angry with her for making him wait. He tells Wadjda's mother that he will no longer drive her to work, but Wadjda and Abdullah find where the driver lives and visit his house to tell him to take her mother's business. After Abdullah threatens to have his uncle deport the driver, he agrees.\n\nMeanwhile, Wadjda's grandmother on her father's side is looking for a second wife for her son because Wadjda's mother cannot have any more children and Wadjda's uncle wants a son. Wadjda's mother is angry and scared by this, so she tries on a beautiful red dress for her brother-in-law's wedding to gain support and to \"scare off\" any potential women who may consider marrying him.\n\nAt school, Wadjda decides to join the religion club to participate in a [[Quran]] recital competition featuring a [[Saudi riyal|SR]]1,000 cash prize (equivalent of about US$270<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.xe.com/currencyconverter/convert/?Amount=1&From=USD&To=SAR |title=1 Saudi Riyal equals 0.27 US Dollar |publisher=xe.com |access-date=2014-03-28}}</ref>). Meanwhile, two girls at the [[madrasa]] caught by the headmistress for adorning themselves with nail polish and marker-drawn ankle tattoos are surprised when Wadjda, in keeping with her new pious image, does not stand with them by testifying in their favor. Wadjda's efforts at memorization impress her teacher, and she wins the competition. The staff and students are shocked when Wadjda announces her intention to buy a bicycle with the prize money. The headmistress is furious, and instead donates the reward to [[State of Palestine|Palestine]] against Wadjda's will.\n\nWadjda returns home to find her father and begins crying when he says he is proud that she won the competition. After a brief conversation, he asks Wadjda to tell her mother that he loves her, and leaves the house to take a phone call. Later, Wadjda finds out that her father has taken a second wife as she joins her mother in viewing the wedding ceremony from their rooftop. Wadjda suggests that her mother could buy the red dress and win her father back again, but her mother reveals that she has instead spent the money on the green bike her daughter wants. The two hug as fireworks from the wedding light up the night sky behind them.\n\nThe next day, Wadjda rides down the street on her new bike. The owner of the bike shop sees her passing and smiles. She races Abdullah and wins.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Reem Abdullah]] as Mother\n*[[Waad Mohammed]] as Wadjda (\u0648\u062c\u062f\u0629)\n*[[Abdullrahman Al Gohani|Abdullrahman Al Juhani]] as Abdullah\n*[[Sultan Al Assaf]] as Father<ref name=\"Filmportal\">{{cite web|url=http://www.filmportal.de/en/movie/wadjda_|title=Filmportal: Wadjda|access-date=6 April 2013}}</ref>\n*[[Ahd Kamel]] as Ms Hussa (credited as Ahd)\n*Ibrahim Al Mozael as Toyshop Owner\n*Nouf Saad as Qu'ran Teacher\n*Rafa Al Sanea as Fatima\n*Alanoud Sajini as Fatin\n*Rehab Ahmed as Noura\n*Dana Abdullilah as Salma \n*Mohammed Zahir as Iqbal \u2013 the Driver\n\n==Production==\nAccording to the director [[Haifaa al-Mansour]], it took five years to make ''Wadjda''. She spent most of the time trying to find financial backing and getting filming permission, since she insisted on filming in Saudi Arabia for reasons of authenticity. She received backing from [[Rotana Group|Rotana]], the film production company of Prince [[Alwaleed bin Talal]]. However, she very much wanted to find a foreign co-producer because \"in Saudi there are no movie theatres, there is no film industry to speak of and, therefore, little money for investment\".<ref name=\"FT\">{{Citation | last =Grey | first =Tobias | title = The undercover director | newspaper = Financial Times| page =14 | date = 30\u201331 March 2013}}</ref> After her selection for a [[Sundance Institute]] writer's lab in Jordan, al-Mansour got in touch with the German production company Razor Film, which had previously produced films with Middle-Eastern topics (''[[Paradise Now]]'' and ''[[Waltz with Bashir]]'').<ref name=FT/> The production involved co-operation with two German public TV broadcasters, [[Norddeutscher Rundfunk]] and [[Bayerischer Rundfunk]].<ref name=Filmportal/> Additional funding came from {{Interlanguage link multi|Filmf\u00f6rderungsanstalt|de}} (FFA, Berlin); [[Medienboard Berlin-Brandenburg]] GmbH (MBB, Potsdam); Mitteldeutsche Medienf\u00f6rderung GmbH (MDM, Leipzig); and Filmfonds Babelsberg (ILB, Potsdam-Babelsberg).<ref name=Filmportal/>\n\nAl-Mansour's screenplay was influenced by [[Neorealism (art)|neorealist cinema]] such as [[Vittorio De Sica]]'s ''[[Bicycle Thieves]]'', [[Jafar Panahi]]'s ''[[Offside (2006 Iranian film)|Offside]]'' and the [[Dardenne brothers]]' ''[[Rosetta (film)|Rosetta]]''. The final scene recalls the final scene of [[Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut]]'s ''[[The 400 Blows]]''. Al-Mansour says that the original version of her screenplay was much bleaker than the finished product: \"I decided I didn't want the film to carry a slogan and scream, but just to create a story where people can laugh and cry a little.\"<ref name=FT/> Al-Mansour based the character of Wadjda on one of her nieces and also on her own experiences when growing up.<ref name=FT/> The main themes of the story are freedom, as represented by the bicycle, and the fear of [[Abandonment (emotional)|emotional abandonment]], as Wadjda's father wants to take a second wife who will provide him with a son.<ref name=FT/>\n\n''Wadjda'' was filmed on the streets of [[Riyadh]], which often made it necessary for the director to work from the back of a van, as she could not publicly mix with the men in the crew. Often, she could only communicate via walkie-talkie and had to watch the actors on a monitor. This made it difficult to direct: \"It made me realise the need to rehearse and to develop an understanding for each scene before we shot it.\"<ref name=FT/>\n\nWaad Mohammed, who plays Wadjda, was a first-time actress.<ref name=FT/>\n\n==Reception==\n''Wadjda'' received critical acclaim. The [[film-critic]]s aggregate [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reported 99% of critics gave the film a positive review based on 122 reviews, with an average score of 8/10. The critical consensus is: \"Transgressive in the best possible way, ''Wadjda'' presents a startlingly assured new voice from a corner of the globe where cinema has been all but silenced.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/wadjda_2013/|title=Wadjda \u2013 Rotten Tomatoes |access-date=13 November 2022|publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]}}</ref> [[Metacritic]], which assigns a standardized score out of 100, rated the film 81 based on 26 reviews, indicating \"universal acclaim\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/wadjda|title=Wadjda Reviews \u2013 Metacritic|access-date=16 October 2013|publisher=[[Metacritic]]}}</ref>\n\nFilm critics cite the ways ''Wadjda'' is able to grapple with important societal issues, while also accurately understanding the limits of large scale change. ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' film critic [[A. O. Scott|A.O. Scott]] states, \"With impressive agility, ''Wadjda'' finds room to maneuver between harsh realism and a more hopeful kind of storytelling\"; it accurately shows the immense challenges women face in Saudi Arabia, while also showing that there is room for change and growth.<ref name=\"nytimes.com\">{{Cite news |last=Scott |first=A.
