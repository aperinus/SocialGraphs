The film, based on [[Marc Behm]]'s novel of the same name and a [[remake]] of [[Claude Miller]]'s 1983 French thriller ''[[Deadly Circuit]]'', is directed and [[Film adaptation|adapted]] by [[Stephan Elliott]].\n\nStarring [[Ewan McGregor]] and [[Ashley Judd]], the film is an [[international co-production]] of [[Cinema of Canada|Canada]], the [[Cinema of the United Kingdom|United Kingdom]], and [[Cinema of Australia|Australia]].\n\n==Plot==\nStephen Wilson aka \"The Eye\" ([[Ewan McGregor]]) is an [[intelligence agent]] whose current assignment is to track down the socialite son of his wealthy boss and find out what trouble he has gotten himself into. This leads him to Joanna Eris ([[Ashley Judd]]), a [[serial killer]] who is in a relationship with the son, whom she murders. Stephen is a witness to the crime.\n\nAt [[Union Station (Pittsburgh)|Penn Station]] in [[Pittsburgh]], Eris commits yet another murder, enabling Stephen to finally corner her as he prepares to call for backup. Instead of turning her in, Stephen follows her in an effort to save her. He hallucinates constantly that his young daughter \u2013 whom he hasn't seen since his ex-wife took custody of her \u2013 is with him, and comes to think of Eris as a vulnerable, lost child.\n\nStephen follows her across the country and through several murders. He soon discovers that Eris and her father were very poor and that he had abandoned her, explaining her pathological hatred of men. When Eris helps a rich blind man ([[Patrick Bergin]]) in an airport, the two become involved, fall in love and become engaged, and it looks like they might even live a happy life together. Stephen, who has witnessed all of this, is desperate to keep her from killing again. While the couple is on the way to the chapel for the wedding, Stephen shoots out one of their tires and the car crashes, killing Eris' fianc\u00e9. Stephen follows a grief-stricken Eris as she takes off for the desert.\n\nA drug addict named Gary ([[Jason Priestley]]) picks up Eris when her car dies, and tries to seduce her; when she rebuffs his advances, he beats her unconscious and injects her with [[heroin]] so he can rape her while she is unconscious. Stephen arrives just in time to save Eris and gives Gary a thorough beating. Eris loses her unborn baby before fleeing to Alaska, with Stephen on her trail.\n\nIn Alaska, Stephen gains the courage to ask out Eris, as he is a frequent patron of the diner at which she waitresses. They have a few drinks in the evening, both getting emotional, and Eris mentions where she would like to be buried when she dies. She then says she has nothing to offer and that he should leave her alone. The next day the police, as well as Eris's psychiatrist ([[Genevi\u00e8ve Bujold]]), come to the diner to arrest her. Stephen tries to save her, taking her to his trailer. There she is horrified to find out that he has been following her. She shoots him with Stephen's revolver, although she doesn't realize that he had loaded it with blank cartridges. She flees and he follows her on a motorcycle. He catches up to her, but she crashes her car onto an ice-covered lake, breaking through the ice. He then quickly pulls her out of the car, but she is badly injured. Before she dies in his arms, she tells him, \u201cI wish you love\u201d.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Ewan McGregor]] as Stephen Wilson / \"The Eye\"\n* [[Ashley Judd]] as Joanna Eris\n* [[Patrick Bergin]] as Alexander Leonard\n* [[Genevi\u00e8ve Bujold]] as Dr. Jeanne Brault\n* [[Jason Priestley]] as Gary\n* [[k.d. lang]] as Hilary\n* [[Steven McCarthy (actor)|Steven McCarthy]] as Paul Hugo\n* [[Vlasta Vr\u00e1na]] as Mr. Hugo, Sr.\n* David Nerman as Mickey Argyle\n* Jeanine Thierault as Nathy\n* Don Jordan as Toohey\n* Anne-Marie and Kaitlin Brown as Lucy Wilson\n}}\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Box office===\nDespite opening in the United States at number-one during the [[Super Bowl]] weekend and grossing $6 million on its opening weekend, ''Eye of the Beholder'' was a [[Box office bomb|financial failure]] in theaters, grossing $16.5 million domestically and $1.1 million internationally for a worldwide total of $17.6 million against a $35 million budget.<ref name=\"mojo\">{{cite web | url= http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=eyeofthebeholder.htm | title=Eye of the Beholder | work=[[Box Office Mojo]] | publisher=[[IMDb]]| access-date=10 May 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Critical response===\nThe film received largely negative reviews, with critics panning the improbable and muddled plot, as well as Elliott's direction.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Travers|first1=Peter|title=Eye of the Beholder|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/reviews/eye-of-the-beholder-20000128|website=The Rolling Stone|access-date=11 July 2017|date=28 January 2000}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/library/film/012800eye-film-review.html|title='Eye of the Beholder': She's a Real Killer, and He's Smitten|website=www.nytimes.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1= Major |first1= Wade |title= Eye of the Beholder |url= http://pro.boxoffice.com/reviews/2008-08-eye-of-the-beholder?q=Eye+of+the+Beholder |website= BoxOffice |access-date = 11 July 2017 |url-status = dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20160307205828/http://pro.boxoffice.com/reviews/2008-08-eye-of-the-beholder?q=Eye+of+the+Beholder |archive-date= 7 March 2016 |date=28 January 2000 }}</ref> On [[Rotten Tomatoes]], it has an approval rating of {{RT data|score}} based on {{RT data|count}} reviews, with an average score of {{RT data|average}}.
