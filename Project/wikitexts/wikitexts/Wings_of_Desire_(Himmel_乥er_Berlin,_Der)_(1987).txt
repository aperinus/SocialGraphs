The film is about invisible, immortal [[angel]]s who populate Berlin and listen to the thoughts of its human inhabitants, comforting the distressed. Even though the city is densely populated, many of the people are isolated or estranged from their loved ones. One of the angels, played by [[Bruno Ganz]], falls in love with a beautiful, lonely [[trapeze]] artist, played by [[Solveig Dommartin]]. The angel chooses to become mortal so that he can experience human sensory pleasures, ranging from enjoying food to touching a loved one, and so that he can discover human love with the trapeze artist.\n\nInspired by art depicting angels visible around [[West Berlin]], at the time encircled by the [[Berlin Wall]], Wenders and author [[Peter Handke]] conceived of the story and continued to develop the screenplay throughout the [[Cinema of France|French]] and [[Cinema of Germany|German]] co-production. The film was shot by [[Henri Alekan]] in both colour and a sepia-toned black-and-white, the latter being used to represent the world as seen by the angels. The cast includes [[Otto Sander]], [[Curt Bois]] and [[Peter Falk]].\n\nFor ''Wings of Desire'', Wenders won awards for Best Director at both the [[Best Director Award (Cannes Film Festival)|Cannes Film Festival]] and [[European Film Award for Best Director|European Film Awards]]. The film was a critical and financial success, and academics have interpreted it as a statement of the importance of cinema, libraries, the circus, or [[German reunification|German unity]], containing [[New Age]], religious, secular or other themes.\n\nIt was followed by a sequel, ''[[Faraway, So Close!]]'', released in 1993. ''[[City of Angels (film)|City of Angels]]'', a U.S. remake, was released in 1998. In 1990, numerous critics named ''Wings of Desire'' as one of the best [[1980s in film|films of the 1980s]].\n\n==Plot==\nIn a [[Berlin]] divided by the [[Berlin Wall]], two [[angel]]s, Damiel and Cassiel, watch the city, unseen and unheard by its human inhabitants. They observe and listen to the thoughts of Berliners, including a pregnant woman in an ambulance on the way to the hospital, a young [[prostitution in Germany|prostitute]] standing by a busy road, and a broken man who feels betrayed by his wife. Their ''[[:wikt:raison d'\u00eatre|raison d'\u00eatre]]'' is, as Cassiel says, to \"assemble, testify, preserve\" reality. Damiel and Cassiel have always existed as angels; they were in Berlin before it was a city, and before there were any humans.\n\nAmong the Berliners they encounter in their wanderings is an old man named Homer, who dreams of an \"epic of peace\". Cassiel follows the old man as he looks for the then-demolished [[Potsdamer Platz]] in an open field, and finds only the [[graffiti]]-covered Wall. Although Damiel and Cassiel are pure observers, visible only to children, and incapable of any interaction with the physical world, Damiel begins to fall in love with a profoundly lonely circus trapeze artist named Marion. She lives by herself in a caravan in [[West Berlin]], until she receives the news that her group, the Circus Alekan, will be closing down. Depressed, she dances alone to the music of [[Crime & the City Solution]], and drifts through the city.\n\nMeanwhile, actor [[Peter Falk]] arrives in West Berlin to make a film about the city's [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]] past. Falk was once an angel, but, having grown tired of always observing and never experiencing, renounced his immortality to become a participant in the world. Also growing weary of infinity, Damiel's longing is for the genuineness and limits of human existence. He meets Marion in a dream, and is surprised when Falk senses his presence and tells him about the pleasures of human life.\n[[File:GWT 39, Boyenstra\u00dfe im Juni 1989.jpg|thumb|The graffiti on the [[Berlin Wall]] is depicted in the film.]]\n\nDamiel is finally persuaded to shed his immortality. He experiences life for the first time: he bleeds, sees colours, tastes food and drinks coffee. Meanwhile, Cassiel taps into the mind of a young man just about to commit suicide by jumping off a building. Cassiel tries to save the young man but is unable to do so, and is left tormented by the experience. Sensing Cassiel's presence, Falk reaches out to him as he had Damiel, but Cassiel is unwilling to follow their example. Eventually, Damiel meets the trapeze artist Marion at a bar during a concert by [[Nick Cave]], and she greets him and speaks about finally finding a love that is serious and can make her feel complete. The next day, Damiel considers how his time with Marion taught him to feel amazed, and how he has gained knowledge no angel is capable of achieving.\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\n[[File:Berlin Tiergarten Siegessaeule 2.jpg|thumb|Berlin art depicting angels served as an inspiration to the filmmakers.]]\nAfter living and working in the United States for eight years, director [[Wim Wenders]] returned to his native [[West Germany]] and wished to reconnect to it with a film about his favourite part of it, [[West Berlin]].<ref name=\"KennyWenders\"/> Planning to make ''[[Until the End of the World]]'' in 1985, he realised the project would not be ready for two years, and wishing to return to photography as soon as possible, he considered another project.{{sfn|Cook|1997|p=164}}\n\n[[Rainer Maria Rilke]]'s poetry partially inspired the story.

[[Powell and Pressburger]]'s ''[[A Matter of Life and Death (film)|A Matter of Life and Death]]'' presents an early example of spirits being jealous of the lives of humans.{{sfn|Kolker|Beicken|1993|p=141}} The shift from monochrome to colour, to distinguish the angels' reality from that of the mortals, was also used in Powell and Pressburger's film.{{sfn|Batchelor|2000|p=37}} While ''Wings of Desire'' does not portray Berliners as living in a utopia, academic Roger Cook wrote that the fact that people have pleasure \"gives, as the English title suggests, wings to desire\".{{sfn|Cook|1997|p=165}}\n\n[[Portrayals of God in popular media|God]] is not mentioned in the film,{{sfn|Graf|2002|p=115}} and is only referred to in the sequel ''[[Faraway, So Close!]]'' when the angels state a purpose to connect humans with \"Him\".{{sfn|Hasenberg|1997|p=54}} Scholars [[Robert P. Kolker|Robert Phillip Kolker]] and Peter Beickene attributed the apparent lack of God to [[New Age]] beliefs, remarking Damiel's \"[[fallen angel|fall]]\" is similar to the story of [[Lucifer]], though not related to evil.{{sfn|Kolker|Beicken|1993|p=148}} Reviewer [[Jeffrey Overstreet]] concurred that \"Wenders had left his church upbringing behind\", and the cinematic angels are \"inventions he could craft to his specifications\", with little regard for biblical beliefs. Overstreet characterized them as \"whimsical metaphors, characters who have lost the joy of sensual human experience\".{{sfn|Overstreet|2007|p=122}} Nevertheless, Professor [[Craig Detweiler]] believed the sky-level view of Berlin and the idea of [[guardian angel]]s evoke God.{{sfn|Detweiler|2009|p=124}} Authors Martin Brady and Joanne Leal added that even if Damiel is tempted by seemingly profane things, the atmosphere of Berlin means the human Damiel is still in \"a place of poetry, myth and religion\".{{sfn|Brady|Leal|2011|p=263}}\n\nIn one scene, Damiel and Cassiel meet to share stories in their observations, with their function revealed to be one of preserving the past.{{sfn|Graf|2002|p=116}} Professor Alexander Graf wrote this connects them to cinema, with Wenders noting ''Wings of Desire'' itself depicts or shows places in Berlin that have since been destroyed or altered, including a bridge, [[Potsdamer Platz]] and the [[Berlin Wall|Wall]].{{sfn|Graf|2002|pp=117-118}}\n\nThe closing titles state: \"Dedicated to all the former angels, but especially to Yasujiro, Fran\u00e7ois and Andrej\" (all references to Wenders' fellow filmmakers [[Yasujir\u014d Ozu]], [[Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut]], and [[Andrei Tarkovsky]]).{{sfn|Scheibel|2017|p=167}} These directors had all died before the release of the film, with Kolker and Beickene arguing they were an influence on Wenders: Ozu had taught Wenders order; Truffaut the observation of people, especially youth;{{sfn|Kolker|Beicken|1993|p=138}} and Tarkovsky, a less clear influence on Wenders, consideration of morality and beauty.{{sfn|Kolker|Beicken|1993|p=140}} Identifying directors as angels could tie in with the film characters' function to record.{{sfn|Graf|2002|p=118}}\n[[File:Ozu Yasujiro.jpg|left|thumb|[[Yasujir\u014d Ozu]], one of the film dedication's \"angels\".]]\n\nAcademic Laura Marcus believed a connection between cinema and print is also established in the angels' affinity for libraries, as Wenders portrays the library as a tool of \"memory, and public space\", making it a miraculous place.{{sfn|Marcus|2015|pp=205-206}} The depiction of Damiel, by using a pen or an immaterial pen, to write \"Song of Childhood\", is also tribute to print and literacy, introducing, or as Marcus hypothesized, \"perhaps even releasing, the visual images that follow\".{{sfn|Marcus|2015|p=206}} Kolker and Beickene interpreted the use of poetry as part of screenwriter Peter Handke's efforts to elevate language above common rhetoric to the spiritual.{{sfn|Kolker|Beicken|1993|p=147}} Reviewing the poetry, Detweiler remarked that Handke's \"Song of Childhood\" bears parallels to [[St. Paul]]'s [[1 Corinthians 13]] (\"''When I was a child, I spoke as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child ... ''\").{{sfn|Detweiler|2017}} Professor Terrie Waddell added that the poem established \"centrality of childhood\" as a key theme, noting that the children can see angels and accept them without question, tying them in with the phenomenon of [[imaginary friend]]s.{{sfn|Waddell|2015}}\n\nThe film has also been read as a call for [[German reunification]], which followed in 1990. Essayists David Caldwell and Paul Rea saw it as presenting a series of two opposites: East and West, angel and human, male and female.{{sfn|Graf|2002|p=114}} Wenders' angels are not bound by the Wall, reflecting East and West Berlin's shared space, though East Berlin remains primarily black and white.{{sfn|Byg|2014|p=28}} Scholar Martin Jesinghausen believed the film presumed reunification would never happen, and contemplated its statements on divides, including territorial and \"higher\" divides, \"physicality and spirituality, art and reality, black and white and colour\".{{sfn|Jesinghausen|2000|p=80}}\n\nResearcher Helen Stoddart, in discussing the depiction of the circus and trapeze artist Marion in particular, submitted that Marion is the classic circus character, creating an image of danger and then potential. Stoddart argued that Homer and Marion may find the future in what remains of history found in Berlin.{{sfn|Stoddart|2000|p=188}} Stoddart considered the circular nature of the story, including a parallel between the angel who cannot see the physical (Damiel), and the faux angel (Marion) who can \"see the faces\".{{sfn|Stoddart|2000|p=178}} Marion also observes that all directions lead to the Wall, and the final French dialogue \"We have embarked\" while the screen states \"[[To be continued]]\", suggests \"final movement to a new beginning\".{{sfn|Stoddart|2000|pp=179-180}}\n\nWriting in the journal ''[[Film and Philosophy]]'', Nathan Wolfson cites [[Roland Barthes]]'s work\u2014especially ''[[S/Z]]''\u2014as a model to argue that \"This 'angelic' portion of Wings of Desire deliberately invokes in the viewer a set of specific responses. These responses provide the foundation for the transformation that Damiel and Marion participate in. The film prepares the viewer for an analogous transformation, and invites the viewer to participate in this process, through an exploration of authorship and agency.\"<ref>Wolfson, Nathan. (2003).

In Singer's estimation, the cinematography is able to communicate the angels' \"invisible intimacy and empathy\".<ref name=\"Singer\"/> Professor Terrie Waddell described the \"dialogue and monologue\" as \"lyrical\", in the mold of Rilke's poetry.{{sfn|Waddell|2015}} Scholar Alexander Graf considered how these voice-overs and verbal exchanges are frequently combined with background radio and television sounds, and concluded the \"image and soundtrack\" that comprise the style convey a point of \"blindness\": \"men and women are plagued by their everyday problems; children are, like the angels, in their own dreamy world\".{{sfn|Graf|2002|p=119}}\n\nProfessor Russell J.A. Kilbourn judged the style as opposed to [[realism (arts)|realism]] and \"emphatically German\" in looking at particular situations of human life.{{sfn|Kilbourn|2013|p=83}} Authors Martin Brady and Joanne Leal remarked the storytelling shies away from an entirely [[narrative]] format, and the film's writing style is embodied in the Homer character as \"the angel of story-telling\".{{sfn|Brady|Leal|2011|p=263}} Perception of people becomes key to the storytelling, with Brady and Leal quoting Handke's vision for a new narrative: \"You have only interpreted and changed the world; what matters is to ''describe'' it\".{{sfn|Brady|Leal|2011|p=264}} Psychologist Ryan Niemiec wrote that, by focusing on \"the beauty of each moment\", ''Wings of Desire'' conveys \"awe and wonder\".{{sfn|Niemiec|2009|p=138}}\n\nAs Singer observed, ''Wings of Desire'' serves as a \"Symphony of a city\" in capturing a \"wintry, pre-unification Berlin\".<ref name=\"Singer\"/> Kilbourn said that the place highlighted in the German title ''Der Himmel \u00fcber Berlin'', like the desire referenced in the English title, is of great importance, and that the \"frequent angel's-eye-view shots of East and West Berlin\" allows for \"quasi-objective voyeuristic surveillance\".{{sfn|Kilbourn|2013|p=84}} Observing the angels' trench-coat fashion, sociologist [[Andrew Greeley]] wrote it fit the \"wet, blustery, cold northern Germany\" setting.{{sfn|Greeley|2017|p=118}} Looking at the coats and ponytails, Dr. Detweiler found the visualization of the angels \"so cool and stylish\".{{sfn|Detweiler|2017}}\n\nMusic is used in differing ways throughout the story. Musicologist Annette Davison argued Knieper's score in angel scenes is artistic, with elements of Eastern European and Orthodox Christian music, and Petitgand's music displays a \"slippery\" harmony frequently heard in circus entertainment.{{sfn|Davison|2017}} When Marion leaves the Circus Alekan, there is an increase in [[rock music]], particularly by Cave and [[Crime & the City Solution]]. Davison submitted this symbolizes \"utopian promise of the sensual mortal world\", and that lyrics echo the plot: Cave's \"[[The Carny]]\" suggests a disappearing carnival worker as the Circus Alekan closes, and \"[[From Her to Eternity]]\" suggests a desire for a woman's love.{{sfn|Davison|2017}} Professor Adrian Danks wrote that Cave's rock music symbolized \"the physical, worldly reality of Berlin\", with \"The Carny\" adding a feel of sorrow in the background, while Marion gives \"breathy accompaniment\".{{sfn|Danks|2016|p=114}}\n\n==Release==\n[[File:20150212 - Wim Wenders at Berlinale by sebaso 1.jpg|thumb|left|[[Wim Wenders]] attended the [[65th Berlin International Film Festival|2015 Berlin International Film Festival]].]]\nThe film debuted at the [[1987 Cannes Film Festival|Cannes Film Festival]] on 17 May 1987.{{sfn|Reimer|Reimer|2010|p=xxxvii}} ''Der Himmel \u00fcber Berlin'' subsequently opened in West Germany late in October 1987.<ref name=\"Filmlexikon\">{{cite web|url=https://www.zweitausendeins.de/filmlexikon/?sucheNach=titel&wert=1181|title=Der Himmel \u00fcber Berlin|work=Lexikon des internationalen Films|language=de|access-date=5 July 2017|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161010212949/http://www.zweitausendeins.de/filmlexikon/?sucheNach=titel&wert=1181|archive-date=10 October 2016}}</ref> With [[Orion Classics]] as its U.S. distributor,{{sfn|Tzioumakis|2012|p=74}} it opened in [[New York City]] as ''Wings of Desire'' on 29 April 1988 with a [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system|PG-13 rating]].<ref name=\"Maslin\"/> Sander said that it had a release in Japan, and that while angels do not appear in [[Japanese mythology]], Tokyo audiences would approach him after and share their impressions about the characters.<ref name=\"Sander\"/>\n\nAfter a videotape printing in Germany in 1988, Kinowelt released a DVD in Germany and [[DVD region code#2|Region 2]] in 2005.<ref name=\"Filmlexikon\"/> In 2009, [[The Criterion Collection]] released the film in [[DVD region code#1|Region 1]] on [[DVD]] and [[Blu-ray]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://collider.com/wings-of-desire-criterion-blu-ray-review/ |last=Dellamorte |first=Andre |date=11 November 2009 |title=Wings of Desire Criterion Blu-ray Review |work=[[Collider (website)|Collider]] |access-date=5 July 2017 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170903165044/http://collider.com/wings-of-desire-criterion-blu-ray-review/ |archive-date=3 September 2017 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.slantmagazine.com/dvd/review/wings-of-desire |last=Weber |first=Bill |date=2 November 2009 |title=Wings of Desire |work=[[Slant Magazine]] |access-date=19 December 2017 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171212062233/https://www.slantmagazine.com/dvd/review/wings-of-desire |archive-date=12 December 2017 }}</ref> It later screened at the [[65th Berlin International Film Festival]] in February 2015, to mark Wenders' Honorary [[Golden Bear]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.berlinale.de/en/archiv/jahresarchive/2015/08_pressemitteilungen_2015/08_pressemitteilungen_2015detail_1_24148.html |last=Press Office |date=21 August 2014 |title=Berlinale 2015: Homage and Honorary Golden Bear for Wim Wenders |publisher=[[Berlin International Film Festival]] |access-date=5 July 2017 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170903165650/https://www.berlinale.de/en/archiv/jahresarchive/2015/08_pressemitteilungen_2015/08_pressemitteilungen_2015detail_1_24148.html |archive-date=3 September 2017 }}</ref>\n\nThe Wim Wenders Foundation produced a digital [[4K resolution|4K]] [[film restoration|restoration]] using the original black-and-white and colour film stock.
