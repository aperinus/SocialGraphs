(Keitel) as he struggles to accept the secret hidden by his independent and free-spirited girlfriend (Bethune).\n\nThis film was a nominee at the [[1967 in film|1967]] [[Chicago International Film Festival|Chicago Film Festival]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Chicago International Film Festival (1967) |url=https://www.imdb.com/event/ev0000165/1967 |website=[[IMDb]] |access-date=11 July 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nJ.R. is a typical [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] [[Italian-American]] young man on the streets of [[New York City]]. Even as an adult, he stays close to home with a core group of friends with whom he drinks and carouses around. He gets involved with a local girl he meets on the [[Staten Island Ferry]], and decides he wants to get married and settle down. As their relationship deepens, he declines her offer to have sex because he thinks she is a [[Virginity|virgin]] and he wants to wait rather than \"spoil\" her.<ref name=Canby />\n\nOne day, his girlfriend tells him that she was once [[raped]] by a former boyfriend. This crushes J.R., and he rejects her and attempts to return to his old life of drinking with his friends. However, after a particularly wild party with friends, he realizes he still loves her and returns to her apartment one early morning. He awkwardly tells her that he forgives her and says that he will \"marry her anyway.\"<ref name=Canby /> Upon hearing this, the girl tells him marriage would never work if her past weighs on him so much. J.R. becomes enraged and calls her a [[whore]],<ref name=Canby /> but quickly recants and says he is confused by the whole situation. She tells him to go home, and he returns to the Catholic church, but finds no solace.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Zina Bethune]] as Girl\n* [[Harvey Keitel]] as J.R. \n* Ann Collette as Girl In Dream\n* Lennard Kuras as Joey \n* Michael Scala as Sally Gaga\n* [[Harry Northup]] as Harry \n* Tuai Yu-Lan as Girl In Dream\n* [[Saskia Holleman]] as Girl In Dream\n* [[Bill Minkin]] as Iggy At Party \n* Philip Carlson as Boy In Copake \n* Wendy Russell as Gaga's Girl \n* Robert Uricola as Boy With Gun\n* Susan Wood as Girl At Party \n* Marisa Joffrey as Girl At Party \n* [[Catherine Scorsese]] as Mother \n* Victor Magnotta as Boy In Fight\n* Paul DeBonde as Boy In Fight\n\n[[Martin Scorsese]] appears in an uncredited role as a gangster.\n\n==Production==\n''Who's That Knocking at My Door'' was filmed in [[New York City]] over the course of two years, undergoing many changes, new directions and different names along the way. The film began in 1965 by Scorsese as a student short film about J.R. and his do-nothing friends called ''Bring on the Dancing Girls''. In 1967, the romance plot with [[Zina Bethune]] was introduced and spliced together with the earlier film, and the title was changed to ''I Call First''. Haig Manoogian, Scorsese's professor at NYU, provided $5,000 in seed money before raising an additional $65,000 from independent investors. Apart from the three producers, no one who worked on the film was over the age of twenty-five.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://catalog.afi.com/Catalog/MovieDetails/21659|title=Who's That Knocking at My Door |website=[[AFI Catalog of Feature Films]]}}</ref>\n\nThe film was shot with a combination of [[35mm movie film|35 mm]] and [[16 mm]] cameras. Scorsese shot most of the 35&nbsp;mm footage with a Mitchell BNC camera, a very cumbersome camera that impeded mobility. He opted to shoot several scenes with the 16&nbsp;mm [[Eclair (camera)|Eclair NPR]] camera in order to introduce greater mobility, then blow up the footage to 35&nbsp;mm.{{Citation needed|date=October 2020}}\n\n==Release==\nThe film received its world premiere at the [[Chicago International Film Festival]] in November 1967. A year later, in 1968, exploitation distributor Joseph Brenner offered to purchase the film and distribute it on the condition that a sex scene be added so they can market the film as a sex exploitation.<ref name=Canby /> Scorsese shot and edited a technically beautiful but largely gratuitous montage of J.R. fantasizing about bedding a series of prostitutes (shot in [[Amsterdam]], the [[Netherlands]] with a visibly older Keitel). The film was re-titled ''Who's That Knocking at My Door'' (named for the 1959 song by The Genies which closes the film).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dvdverdict.com/reviews/whosthatknocking.php|title= DVD Verdict Review: \"Who's That Knocking at My Door\"|access-date=2007-11-01|website=DVD Verdict}}</ref>\n\nThe film was re-issued in February 1970 by Medford Film Distribution under the title ''J.R.''.<ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Daily Variety]]|date=February 11, 1970|page=2|title='Door' Retitled 'J.R.'}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/26/Martin-Scorsese.html|title=Martin Scorsese Biography (1942-)|access-date= 2007-11-01|website=Film Reference}}</ref> However, all subsequent releases have been published under the 1968 title.\n\n==Reception==\nAmerican critic [[Roger Ebert]] gave the film an extremely positive review after its world premiere at the [[Chicago International Film Festival]] in November 1967 (when it still went by the name ''I Call First''). He called the film \"a work that is absolutely genuine, artistically satisfying and technically comparable to the best films being made anywhere. I have no reservations in describing it as a great moment in American movies.\"<ref>{{Cite web |title=Who's That Knocking at My Door?

The review later stated, \"Scorsese occasionally brings the film to life, as in a weekend drive by J.R. and two buddies to an upstate village where the camera shows up their 'big city' shallowness in comparison to the townspeople. Generally, however, his script and direction lack any dramatic value and give far too much exposure to sexual fantasies on the part of the boy.\"<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://variety.com/1967/film/reviews/who-s-that-knocking-at-my-door-1200421457/ |title=Film Reviews: Who's That Knocking at My Door |magazine=Variety |date=September 11, 1968 |access-date=April 6, 2022}}</ref>\n\nWhen the film received its theatrical release two years later, Ebert admitted that he had been perhaps too eager with his first review, admitting that \"Scorsese was occasionally too obvious, and the film has serious structural flaws.\" However, he was still highly positive towards the film, and suggested that \"It is possible that with more experience and maturity Scorsese will direct more polished, finished films.\"<ref>{{Cite web |title=I Call First / Who's That Knocking at My Door?

The result is a movie that is as precise\u2014and as small\u2014as a contact print.\"<ref name=\"Canby\" />\n\nOn [[Rotten Tomatoes]] the film holds an approval rating of 70% based on 20 reviews, with an average rating of 6.6/10.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Who's That Knocking at My Door?

Mrs. Scorsese would continue to appear in many of her son's films until her death in 1997. Scorsese himself appears uncredited as one of the gangsters.
