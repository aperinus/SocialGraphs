When Tomas' mother finds out, she decides to send him to stay with his older brother Sombra, a student in Mexico City, and Sombra's roommate Santos. After a bus ride, he arrives at his brother's home late at night. The apartment is dark without electricity. The following morning there is no breakfast. Tomas witnesses how he and his roommate can obtain electricity though the neighbor below them by communicating with a girl with Down Syndrome, who will give them an extension cord in return for a story.\nTomas reads the newspaper and discovers a small note about Epigmenio Cruz, a Mexican folk rock musician, hospitalized for liver problems. Tomas, who idolizes Cruz since his father first brought a cassette of his music, suggests they search for and visit him. They get into a protest march of students, the 1999 student protests in Mexico City, and enter a hospital where Cruz had been admitted. Then they cross Mexico City to a zoo where Cruz had been working. His colleague tells them he no longer works there. They eventually find him in a bar. After Tomas heaps praise on him, Cruz falls asleep.\n\n==Reception==\nOn [[review aggregator]] [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film holds an approval rating of 92% based on 52 reviews, with an average rating of 7.54/10.
