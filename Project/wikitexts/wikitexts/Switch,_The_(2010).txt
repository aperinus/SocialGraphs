Despite the objections of her long-time best friend Wally Mars, she chooses to do so alone because she can't wait any longer. She also wants a face-to-face sperm donor, disdaining using a sperm bank.\n\nWally suggests he be the donor, but Kassie believes he is too [[neuroticism|neurotic]], pessimistic, and self-absorbed. Since they are best friends, she thinks \"that would be weird.\" He has always had feelings for Kassie, and they dated six years ago. His friend Leonard points out he missed his chance when she relegated him to the \"friend zone.\"\n\nKassie selects Roland Nilson as her sperm donor; he is a handsome, charming, and married assistant professor at [[Columbia University]]. She organizes an \"[[insemination]] party\", where Wally meets Roland and takes an instant dislike to him. Roland produces his sperm in the bathroom, leaving it in a sample cup. Wally uses the bathroom and sees the sample. Drunk, he plays with the cup and accidentally spills it into the sink. Panicking, he replaces the sperm with his own.\n\nThe next day at work, still [[hangover|hungover]], he remembers nothing. The insemination is successful and Kassie becomes pregnant. Wally is upset when she says that she is returning to her childhood home town in [[Minnesota]], as she thinks it would be a better place to raise a child than [[New York City]]. She leaves, and Wally sinks into a dreary period.\n\nSeven years later, Kassie returns to New York with Sebastian, her precocious and neurotic six-year-old. She wants to reconnect with Wally, and eagerly introduces her boy to him and Wally eventually bonds with Sebastian. Roland is in the picture, as he got divorced and Kassie has started dating him. She believes he is Sebastian's biological father and the relationship might work.\n\nWally notices the strong similarities between him and Sebastian and realizes the result of the switch seven years earlier. Just before Roland proposes to Kassie, Wally reveals to her that Sebastian is his biological son, and he loves her. Shocked and angry about the switch, she rejects him.\n\nAfter some time passes, Wally finds Kassie waiting for him one day after he leaves work. She says that Sebastian really misses and needs him. Wally admits he misses and needs Sebastian, too. Kassie says that she is no longer with Roland and has realized she loves Wally, so he proposes. The final scene shows a happily married Wally and Kassie giving Sebastian an eighth birthday party.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Jennifer Aniston]] as Kassie Larson\n* [[Jason Bateman]] as Wally Mars\n* Thomas Robinson as Sebastian Larson\n** Bryce Robinson as older Sebastian \n* [[Patrick Wilson (American actor)|Patrick Wilson]] as Roland Nilson\n* [[Juliette Lewis]] as Debbie Epstein\n* [[Jeff Goldblum]] as Leonard\n* [[Caroline Dhavernas]] as Pauline\n* [[Scott Elrod]] as Teddy Declan\n* [[Diane Sawyer]] as herself (cameo)\n\n==Production==\nAniston revealed in the DVD \"extras\" that she had known Bateman since she was 25, and the producers and directors noted their good chemistry in working together.\n\n==Release==\nThe film was released on August 20, 2010 in the United States by [[Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures]].\n\n===Critical reception===\nThe review aggregator website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reported that 52% of critics gave the film a positive rating, based on 155 reviews, with an average score of 5.50/10. Its consensus states \"''The Switch'' has an interesting premise and a charming cast; unfortunately, it also has a trite script that hews too close to tired rom-com formulas.\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_switch_2010/ |title=The Switch |work=Rotten Tomatoes |access-date=January 19, 2022}}</ref> On [[Metacritic]], which uses a normalized rating system, the film holds a 52/100 rating, based on 30 reviews, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".<ref>{{Metacritic film|title=The Switch|accessdate= 30 October 2012}}</ref> Aniston was nominated for a [[Golden Raspberry Awards|Razzie Award]] for [[Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Actress|Worst Actress]] for her performance in the film.\n\n[[File:JasonBateman-adjusted.jpg|thumb|160px|[[Jason Bateman]] was praised by critics for his performance.<ref name=\"detnews\"/>]]\n\nAnn Hornaday, writing for ''[[The Washington Post]]'' gave ''The Switch'' three out of four stars. She wrote that \"this disarmingly winning comedy turns into a warm, quirkily observant film, strengthened by some appealing performances and a low-key, easygoing vibe. Less reminiscent of the dreadful comedy ''[[The Back-up Plan]]'' than 2002's lovely ''[[About a Boy (film)|About a Boy]]'', this adaptation of a Jeffrey Eugenides story takes viewers down a path that, while by no means of least resistance, possesses a gratifying share of surprises.\"<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/gog/movies/the-switch,1159888/critic-review.html|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130412033640/http://www.washingtonpost.com/gog/movies/the-switch,1159888/critic-review.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=2013-04-12|first=Ann |last=Hornaday|title=Surprise!
