Claxton]] and produced by [[A. C. Lyles]]. Based upon [[Russell Braddon]]'s 1964 science fiction novel ''[[The Year of the Angry Rabbit]]'', the plot concerns an infestation of mutated rabbits.<ref>[https://entertainment.time.com/2010/08/20/top-10-killer-animal-movies/slide/night-of-the-lepus/ 'Night of the Lepus'|Top 10 Killer-Animal Movies|TIME.com]</ref><ref>[https://www.comingsoon.net/horror/features/839801-in-praise-of-night-of-the-lepus In Praise of Night of the Lepus - ComingSoon.net]</ref><ref>[https://www.shockcinemamagazine.com/lepus.html Shock Cinema Magazine]</ref>\n\nThe film was the first science fiction work for producer Lyles and for director Claxton, both of whom came from [[Western (genre)|Western film]] backgrounds. Character actors from Westerns the pair had worked on were brought in to star, including [[Stuart Whitman]], [[Janet Leigh]], [[Rory Calhoun]] and [[DeForest Kelley]]. Shot in Arizona, ''Night'' used [[domestic rabbit]]s filmed against miniature models and actors dressed in rabbit costumes for the attack scenes.\n\nWidely panned by critics for its silly premise, poor direction, stilted acting and bad special effects, the film's biggest failure is considered to be the inability to make the rabbits seem scary. ''Night of the Lepus'' has since gained [[cult following|cult status]] for its laughably poor quality.\n\n==Plot==\nRancher Cole Hillman seeks the help of college president Elgin Clark to combat thousands of [[rabbit]]s that have invaded the area after their natural predators, [[coyote]]s, were killed off. Elgin asks for the assistance of researchers Roy and Gerry Bennett because they respect Cole's wish to avoid using [[cyanide]] to poison the rabbits. Roy proposes using hormones to disrupt the rabbits' breeding cycle and takes some rabbits for experimentation. One is injected with a new serum believed to cause [[birth defect]]s. However, the Bennetts' daughter Amanda loves the injected rabbit, so she switches it with one from the [[Treatment and control groups|control group]]. Amanda is then given the injected rabbit as a pet, but it soon escapes.\n\nWhile inspecting the rabbits' old burrowing areas, Cole and the Bennetts find a large, unusual animal track. Meanwhile, Cole's son Jackie  and Amanda go to a [[Gold mining|gold mine]] to visit Jackie's friend Billy, but find him missing. Jackie finds more of the animal tracks in Billy's shed, while Amanda goes into the mine and runs into an enormous rabbit with blood on its face. Screaming in terror, she runs from the mine.\n\nMutilated bodies begin to crop up around town, including those of Billy, a truck driver, and a family of four. Elgin, the Bennetts, Cole, and Cole's two ranch hands Frank and Jud go to the mine to try to kill the rabbits with explosives. As Elgin and Frank set charges on top of the mine, Roy and Cole enter the shaft to get pictorial evidence. Outside, a rabbit surfaces and attacks Jud before Gerry can shoot it. Roy and Cole escape the rabbits in the mine and run outside as the explosives are detonated.\n\nThe explosives fail to kill the rabbits, and that night they attack Cole's ranch, killing Jud while Cole, Frank, Jackie, and Cole's housekeeper Dorothy escape into the [[Storm cellar|storm shelter]]. The rabbits make their way to the [[general store]], killing shopkeeper Mildred and eating and killing everyone else they find in the small town of Galanos before taking refuge in the buildings for the day. In the morning, Gerry and Amanda leave to avoid the coming press, but get stuck along a sandy stretch of road. Roy and Elgin update Sheriff Cody on the situation and, after realizing the rabbits have escaped the mine, call in the [[United States National Guard|National Guard]]. As night falls, the rabbits leave Galanos to continue their rampage, making their way to the main town of [[Ajo, Arizona|Ajo]] and eating and killing everyone in their path. Cole proposes using a half-mile wide stretch of electrified [[Track (rail transport)|railroad track]] as a fence to contain and kill the rabbits. They recruit a large group of people at a [[drive-in theater]] to help herd the rabbits with their car lights, with assistance from the machine gun fire of the National Guard.\n\nThousands of rabbits make their way into the trap, where they are shot and electrocuted. At the film's ending, Cole tells Roy that normal rabbits, as well as coyotes, have returned to the ranch.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Stuart Whitman]] as Roy Bennett\n* [[Janet Leigh]] as Gerry Bennett\n* [[Rory Calhoun]] as Cole Hillman\n* [[DeForest Kelley]] as Elgin Clark\n* [[Paul Fix]] as Sheriff Cody\n* [[Melanie Fullerton]] as Amanda Bennett\n* Chris Morrell as Jackie Hillman\n* [[Chuck Hayward]] as Jud\n* Henry Wills as Frank\n* Francesca Jarvis as Mildred\n* [[William Elliott (actor, born 1934)|William Elliott]] as Dr. Leopold\n* Robert Hardy as Professor Dirkson\n* Richard Jacome as Deputy Jason\n* Evans Thornton as Major White\n* Robert Gooden as Leslie\n* [[Don Starr]] as Cutler\n* [[David McCallum]] as Police Officer\n\n[[I.

Lyles]], known primarily for producing [[Western (genre)|western]] films, would make ''Night of the Lepus'' his first and only [[science fiction]] production. To craft the film, he pulled together people he had worked with on other Westerns. Gene R. Kearney and Don Holliday were tasked with converting the novel to a screenplay. In doing so, they removed nearly all aspects of the novel (a black comedy, the plot of which focused on Australia dominating the world with a superweapon inadvertently created through the rabbits), and moved its setting from Australia to Arizona.\n\n===Filming===\n[[Principal photography]] took place at the [[Old Tucson Studios]] in [[Tucson, Arizona]], a site well known for its use in [[Western (genre)|Western]] pictures.<ref name=\"TCM Behind the Scenes\">{{cite web |url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/article.jsp?contentId=181224 |title=Night of the Lepus: TCM Underground - Insider Info |first=David |last=Kalat |publisher=[[Turner Classic Movies]] |access-date=January 3, 2010}}{{dead link |date=May 2019}}</ref> Filming commenced at the end of January 1972 and concluded in early March.<ref name=\"TCM\">{{cite web |url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title.jsp?stid=807 |title=Night of the Lepus (1972) |publisher=[[Turner Classic Movies]] |access-date=January 4, 2010}}</ref>\n\nAccording to [[Turner Classic Movies]]' David Kalat, director Claxton also came from a Western film background. In directing ''Night of the Lepus'', he applied the same techniques used in his other films and declined the use of \"standard\" horror effects that would have enhanced the atmosphere, such as \"canted camera angles, dark shadows, [and] eerie music.\"\n\n[[Rory Calhoun]] was cast as rancher Cole Hilman, whose ranch would be the start of the rabbit explosion. Well known for his western work, ''Lepus'' put him in unfamiliar territory as it was his first science fiction role, however, he found familiarity in the Western film trappings and his role as a rancher.<ref name=\"TCM Behind the Scenes\" />\n\n[[Janet Leigh]], who played Gerry Bennett, accepted the role because filming was close to home, allowing her to travel on weekends and allowing her family to visit her on set. Though she felt the script \"read well\", she declined to allow her two children play minor roles as she did not want them to see or be part of any type of horror film.<ref>{{cite news |title=Callas' New Beau Dean At Juilliard |first=Jack |last=O'Brian |publisher=[[Sarasota Journal]] |date=May 16, 1972 |page=6-B |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ZHU0AAAAIBAJ&dq=night-of-the-lepus&pg=7417%2C2985205 }}</ref> She would later state the film lacked an \"ideal director\" to bring the script to life, and the film failed, in part, because it was impossible to make a \"bunny rabbit menacing\".<ref name=\"TCM Behind the Scenes\" />\n\nShe later reflected \"No one put a gun to my head and said I had to do it. What no one realized was that, no matter what you do, a bunny rabbit is a bunny rabbit [laughs]. A rat, that can be menacing\u2014 so can a frog.

In ''Night'', this was explained by stating that they were descended from recent rabbit farm escapees.<ref name=\"TCM Behind the Scenes\" /> To depict the rabbit attacks, a combination of techniques were used. For some scenes, the rabbits were filmed in close-up stomping on [[Scale model|miniature]] structures in [[slow motion]].<ref name=\"AllMovie Review\">{{cite web |url=https://allmovie.com/work/night-of-the-lepus-103974/review |title=Night of the Lepus Review |first=Jeremy |last=Wheeler |website=[[Allmovie]] |access-date=January 3, 2010 }}</ref> For attack scenes, they had [[ketchup]] smeared on their faces.<ref name=\"Stories\" /> For others, human actors were shown wearing rabbit costumes.<ref name=\"Stories\" /><ref name=\"TCM Behind the Scenes\" /><ref name=\"AllMovie Review\" />\n\n==Release and reception==\n''Night of the Lepus'' was theatrically released on July 26, 1972.<ref name=\"TCM\" />\n\nOriginally titled ''Rabbits'', [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] changed the title and avoided including any rabbits in most promotional materials to try to keep the featured mutant creatures a secret.

Noting that the film had \"a certain overall charm and several striking sequences\", he felt the film would have been more successful if it \"had the courage of its convictions \u2013 and its realism\". As an example, he points to the scene following the attack on the Calhoun ranch, in which Cole is walking into town, and tourists refuse to stop and pick him up because he has a gun. The tourists then go to the small town where the rabbits have killed Mildred and are hiding in the general store building. Rather than becoming the next victims, the family call it a [[ghost town]] and leave.<ref name=\"MFB\">{{cite journal |title=[[Monthly Film Bulletin]] |first=Tom |last=Milne |date=March 1973 |volume=40 |issue=468/479 |page=55 |issn=0027-0407 }}</ref> In the 1977 piece ''Dark Dreams 2.0: A Psychological History of the Modern Horror Film'', Charles Derry compared it to the earlier successful works ''[[The Birds (film)|The Birds]]'' and ''[[Willard (1971 film)|Willard]]'', particularly the former, noting that both featured a \"loveable creature\". Though he felt the special effects were poor, he felt ''Night of the Lepus'' successfully tied into ongoing fears of throwing [[ecology]] out of balance, with the rabbits serving as an appropriate [[metaphor]] for human fears about [[Human overpopulation|overpopulation]].<ref name=\"Dark Dream\">{{cite book |title=Dark Dreams 2.0: A Psychological History of the Modern Horror Film |first=Charles |last=Derry |publisher=McFarland |year=2009 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=loUaJC9VBMUC |isbn=978-0-7864-3397-1 |page=71 }}</ref>\n\n===Retrospective===\n[[AllMovie]]'s Jeremy Wheeler felt the film was \"all good, unintentionally campy fun\" and \"silly to its core\". Noting that the special effects were \"obvious\", he criticized the \"truly heinous dialogue\" and remarked that Leigh \"slums it\" by appearing in the film.<ref name=\"AllMovie Review\" /> In ''Stories Rabbits Tell: A Natural and Cultural History of a Misunderstood Creature'', Susan E. Davis and Margo DeMello considered the film an \"entertaining romp\", praising the \"alarmingly realistic\" circumstances behind the rabbit mutations, while criticizing the \"notoriously badly done\" special effects and the rabbits being made to \"roar\" during their attacks. Calling it \"one of [the] worse career moves\" for Kelley and Leigh, they criticized the ending in which all the rabbits were killed, calling them \"unwitting victims...of human attempts to control nature\".<ref name=\"Stories\" /> In his book ''Videohound's Horror Show: 999 Hair-Raising, Hellish, and Humorous Movies'', critic Mike Mayo panned the film, calling the script \"lame\", the scenes of the rabbits \"hopping around [[HO scale|H0 scale]] sets in slow motion\" humorous, and the rabbits just not scary. He also criticized the principal performers, stating that the film featured a \"group of so-so character actors\", except Leigh who he considered a \"star\", and that all gave \"wooden performances\".<ref name=\"HorrorShow\">{{cite book |last=Mayo |first=Mike |title=VideoHound's Horror Show: 999 Hair-Raising, Hellish and Humorous Movies |date=February 1, 1998 |publisher=Visible Ink Press |location=Detroit |isbn=1-57859-047-7 |oclc=39052368 |page=257 }}</ref>\n\nJohn J. Puccio of DVDTown.com felt ''Lepus'' would have been better had it been an intentionally humorous horror spoof, rather than a legitimate attempt at making a horror film with killer rabbits. Stating that it was in the \"so-bad-it's-good\" category for only two minutes, he found the actors to be \"stiff and uninvolved\" in delivering their lines, and that it seemed more like an \"old television horse opera\" than a horror film with more slow-paced filler than action sequences, and the few bits of action ruined by the \"corniest possible 'action' music\".<ref name=\"DVD Town\">{{cite web |url=http://www.dvdtown.com/review/night-of-the-lepus/dvd/3182 |title=Night Of The Lepus - DVD review |first=John J. |last=Puccio |publisher=DVDTown.com |date=October 9, 2005 |access-date=January 4, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110710160218/http://www.dvdtown.com/review/night-of-the-lepus/dvd/3182 |archive-date=July 10, 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref> [[AMC (TV channel)|AMC Film Critic]]'s Christopher Null states that it is famous as \"one of the worst films ever made\".

Like most critics, he pointed out that the rabbits were \"cute bunnies\" rather than \"fanged, disease-ridden mutated creatures\", but he felt the actors did the best they could with the material, and praised them for \"[keeping] straight faces as they heroically stand against the onslaught of the bunnies\".<ref name=\"Horror films\">{{cite book |title=Horror Films of the 1970s |first= John Kenneth |last=Muir |publisher=[[McFarland & Company]] |date=August 20, 2002 |isbn=0-7864-1249-6 |chapter=1972: Night of the Lepus |pages=216\u2013219 }}</ref>\n\n==Home media==\nThe film did not see a home video release until October 4, 2005 when [[Warner Bros.|Warner Home Video]] brought it out on DVD, with the only special features being the film's trailer and different language and subtitle options.
