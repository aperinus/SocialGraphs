Based on [[Alexandra Bracken]]'s 2012 [[young adult novel]] of the [[The Darkest Minds (book series)|same name]], it was produced by [[Shawn Levy]] and [[Dan Levine]]. The film stars [[Amandla Stenberg]], [[Harris Dickinson]], [[Mandy Moore]] and [[Gwendoline Christie]]. It follows a group of young children and teenagers who are on the run from the government after mysteriously obtaining superpowers.\n\nOn September 15, 2014, it was announced that [[20th Century Fox]] had bought the rights to the novel and that Levy would produce the film through his [[21 Laps Entertainment]]. Stenberg was cast two years later on September 26, 2016 and principal photography began in April 2017 in [[Atlanta|Atlanta, Georgia]].\n\n''The Darkest Minds'' was released in the United States on August 3, 2018, by 20th Century Fox. It received negative reviews from critics, with criticisms towards its acting, direction, screenplay, and \"lack of personality.\" The film was also a [[box-office bomb]], only grossing $41.1 million worldwide against a $34 million budget.<ref>{{Cite web |title=2018's Biggest Box Office Bombs, From 'Gotti' to 'Solo' |url=https://www.thewrap.com/10-biggest-box-office-bombs-of-2018-from-london-fields-to-solo-photos/ |access-date=July 21, 2022 |website=The Wrap}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nIn a dystopian future, a contagious disease called Idiopathic Adolescent Acute Neurodegeneration (IAAN) kills nearly 90 percent of all children and teenagers living in the United States, leaving the survivors with unusual abilities. These survivors with superpowers are imprisoned throughout the country. The children are divided into groups: Green (have increased intelligence), Blue ([[telekinesis]]), Yellow (can manipulate electricity), Red (can control fire), and Orange (have [[telepathy]] and [[Mind Control|mind control]] capabilities). Ruby Daly is an Orange, which means she has the psionic ability to get into people's mind. Children that are Red and Orange are considered too dangerous with their powers and supposed to be killed instantly, but she touches the doctor who is classifying her and puts the thought in his head that she is a Green.\n\nSix years later, Ruby is helped to escape her prison by a resistance group known as the Children's League to fight for her future. Cate, a worker at the camp, provides Ruby with a [[panic button]] that can be activated as a tracker if she is in danger. When Ruby gets visions while touching Rob, another League member, she becomes suspicious of their intentions. Ruby makes her escape with a mute little girl named Suzume (Zu), a Yellow. Zu takes Ruby to Liam, a Blue, and his friend Charles (Chubs), a Green. The three agree to let Ruby join them as they try to make their way to \"East River,\" a purported safe haven led by an Orange named the \"Slip Kid.\"\n\nThe four enter an abandoned mall to gather supplies, where they cross paths with another group of survivors. The others know where East River is, but the only clue they reveal \u2014 due to the subtle influence of Ruby's power \u2014 are the letters \"E.D.O.\". Ruby eventually deduces that this is a [[radio frequency]], which reveals a transmission that East River is in Lake Prince, Virginia.\n\nJourneying to East River, Ruby asks the group to drop her off at her former home in Salem, Virginia hoping she can reconcile with her parents. Seeing them through the glass door, she realizes she made them forget her and runs away. She meets up with Liam, who comforts her and they begin to develop a romantic connection, but Ruby refuses to touch him, fearing that her powers will hurt him. At East River, Slip Kid is revealed to be the president's son, Clancy Gray, who is an Orange. He teaches Ruby how to control her powers, and in return, has Ruby teach him how to erase people's memories. During this process, Clancy controls her mind and kisses her.\n\nIt is revealed that Clancy is using his powers to control the government, and wants to use his new memory-erasing powers to turn Ruby to his side and forget her friends, but she manages to escape with the others. Liam flees with all of the haven children, while Ruby faces off against Clancy, destroying the camp and making her escape with Chubs. Chubs is severely injured, leaving Ruby no choice but to use her panic button to call the League for help.\n\nThe League gets Chubs to a hospital and lets Zu leave with a protective family. Ruby convinces Cate to release Liam in return for taking his place as a soldier in the League. Knowing that Liam will never leave without her, Ruby kisses him and erases all of his memories of herself. Liam leaves the camp, while Ruby begins her training with her fellow powered children in the League. Elsewhere, Clancy looks over the [[United States Army|US Army]] and government forces.\n\n==Cast==\n<!--- Cast and order per tombstone closing credits, roles per closing credits scroll --->\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Amandla Stenberg]] as Ruby Daly\n** Lidya Jewett as 10 year old Ruby\n* [[Mandy Moore]] as Catherine \"Cate\" Connor\n* [[Bradley Whitford]] as President Gray\n* [[Harris Dickinson]] as Liam Stewart\n* [[Patrick Gibson (actor)|Patrick Gibson]] as Clancy Gray\n* [[Skylan Brooks]] as Charles \"Chubs\" Meriwether\n* [[Miya Cech]] as  Suzume \"Zu\" Kimura\n* [[Gwendoline Christie]] as Lady Jane\n* [[Wade Williams]] as Captain McManus\n* [[Mark O'Brien (actor)|Mark O'Brien]] as Rob\n* [[Wallace Langham]] as Dr. Viceroy\n* [[Golden Brooks]] as Molly Daly\n* [[Sammi Rotibi]] as Paul Daly\n}}\n\n==Production==\nOn September 15, 2014, it was announced that [[20th Century Fox]] had bought the film rights to [[Alexandra Bracken]]'s young adult novel ''The Darkest Minds'', the first book in her The Darkest Minds series.
