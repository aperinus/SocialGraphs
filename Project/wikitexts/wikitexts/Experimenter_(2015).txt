The film stars [[Peter Sarsgaard]], [[Winona Ryder]], [[Taryn Manning]], [[Kellan Lutz]], [[Anton Yelchin]], [[John Leguizamo]], [[Lori Singer]], [[Dennis Haysbert]], [[Anthony Edwards (actor)|Anthony Edwards]], and [[Jim Gaffigan]]. The film was released on October 16, 2015, by [[Magnolia Pictures]]. It is also one of the final films to feature Lori Singer before her retirement in 2017.\n\n==Plot==\nThe film is based on the true story of famed social psychologist [[Stanley Milgram]], who in 1961 conducted a series of [[Milgram experiment|radical behavior experiments]] at [[Yale University]] that tested the willingness of ordinary humans to obey an authority figure while administering electric shocks to strangers. In the first half of the film, it is shown how the experiments are conducted, with nearly every test subject succumbing to the pressure of the circumstances and administering shocks to a stranger, despite the stranger begging him to stop. Between the experiments, it is shown how Milgram meets Alexandra (or Sasha), who will become his wife and mother of two children.\n\nThe second half of the film shows how Milgram struggles with the public outcry about the ethics of the experiments and how his career advances as he becomes a professor in New York City and continues to study social interactions and social pressure in more benign experimental settings, including the [[small-world experiment]], the [[Stanley Milgram#Lost letter experiment|lost-letter experiment]], the street-corner (or gawking) experiment, the [[familiar stranger]] experiment, and various experiments that he makes his students carry out.\n\nArchive footage occurs frequently, either as recordings that Milgram watches or as a backdrop for entire scenes. Milgram's work continues until he dies from a heart attack at the age of 51. In the final scene, the street-corner experiment is repeated in the present day, with a cameo of the real-life Sasha Milgram. In a mid-credits scene, more archival footage is shown.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Peter Sarsgaard]] as [[Stanley Milgram]]\n* [[Winona Ryder]] as Alexandra \"Sasha\" Milgram\n* [[Edoardo Ballerini]] as [[Paul Hollander]]\n* [[Jim Gaffigan]] as James McDonough\n* [[Anthony Edwards (actor)|Anthony Edwards]] as Miller\n* John Palladino as John Williams\n* [[Ned Eisenberg]] as [[Solomon Asch]]\n* [[Lori Singer]] as Florence Asch\n* [[Taryn Manning]] as Mrs. Lowe\n* [[Anton Yelchin]] as Rensaleer\n* [[John Leguizamo]] as Taylor\n* [[Kellan Lutz]] as [[William Shatner]]\n* [[Dennis Haysbert]] as [[Ossie Davis]]\n* Emily Tremaine as Sheila Jarcho\n* [[Donnie Keshawarz]] as Bruno\n* [[Frank Harts]] as Washington\n* [[Danny A.
