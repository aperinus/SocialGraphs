Wagner.\n\nThe film stars [[Ryan Reynolds]] as the title character alongside [[Tara Reid]], [[Kal Penn]], and [[Tim Matheson]]. The film follows the misadventures of its lead character, Van Wilder, a seventh-year senior who has made it his life goal to help [[Undergraduate education|undergrads]] at Coolidge College succeed in the future.\n\nAfter an article is written about his legacy by fellow student, Gwen Pearson, played by Reid, Van Wilder's party lifestyle is brought to light. This attracts the attention of Van's father, played by Matheson, who cuts off his tuition. Van Wilder gets stuck in the middle of a [[love triangle]] between Gwen and her mean-spirited boyfriend, Richard \"Dick\" Bagg while struggling to graduate. Van tries various schemes to earn enough money to pay his tuition and graduate, with help from Gwen and the rest of the student body, except a couple of sinister enemies who attempt to sabotage his efforts.\n\nThe film grossed $21,305,259 in the domestic box office; $16,970,224 in the international box office; and $38,275,483 worldwide overall.\n\nA sequel, ''[[Van Wilder: The Rise of Taj]]'', was released on December 1, 2006. A prequel, ''[[Van Wilder: Freshman Year]]'', was released straight-to-DVD on July 14, 2009.\n\n==Plot==\nVance \"Van\" Wilder is a confident and sardonic seventh-year senior at Coolidge College who spends his days driving around campus in his customized golf cart, posing nude for [[figure drawing]] classes, and organizing soirees and fundraisers for his peers. Upon learning that his son is still in school, his father severs financial support. Van seeks a payment extension from the [[Registrar (education)|registrar]], Deloris Haver. After having sex with her, Deloris hands him the paperwork for an extension, which Van realizes he only needed to ask for in the first place.\n\nAfter a couple of attempts to get money fast, Van is approached by the Lambda Omega Omega [[fraternity]], offering to pay him a thousand dollars to throw them a blowout party to boost their popularity. Gwen Pearson, a reporter for the school paper, writes a story crediting Van as the host of the party. Van, who normally refuses to do interviews for the paper, realizes the article can be the \"cash cow\" he needs to stay in school and agrees to sit down with Gwen for a follow-up piece.\n\nGwen's boyfriend, Richard \"Dick\" Bagg, is a pre-medical student and the president of his fraternity Delta Iota Kappa, as well as of the student government. As he learns of Gwen's work with Van, suspecting a growing bond between them, he moves to sabotage their prospective romance. Van and Richard exchange escalating pranks.\n\nGwen learns that Van stopped attending classes years ago, 18 units short of graduation. Angry that she dug into such personal details, Van disassociates himself from Gwen, taking a contemplative look at his life.\n\nRichard arranges to sabotage Van's latest party with Jeannie, a member of a sister sorority, by smuggling underaged children in and getting them drunk, then calling campus police to the scene. Van is arrested for providing alcohol to minors and faces expulsion from Coolidge. He prepares to leave the college until his friend Taj inspires him to fight the charges.\n\nVan throws himself at the mercy of the court, asking that rather than expelling him, they force him to graduate; he offers to complete his remaining units before the semester ends, earning a [[Academic degree|degree]] in [[leisure studies]]. The academic board votes 3\u20132 in favor of Van's reinstatement, Professor McDougal's was the decisive vote for reinstatement, surprisingly. Van begins studying for the finals, which will be held in six days.\n\nOutside the court, Jeannie reveals Richard's plot to Gwen, as well as his infidelity. Angered by this, Gwen pretends to forgive Richard then spikes his protein shake with a powerful [[laxative]] just before his entrance exam to Northwestern Medical School. While taking the exam, Richard begins to have uncontrollable [[flatulence]] and hurries down the line with his exam. Richard then is intercepted by his future alumni intended to interview him for his entrance. Unable to hold it in any longer, Richard strips off his pants and proceeds to shit violently in a wastebasket in front of the medical doctors, much to their horror.\n\nVan uses the entire exam period for his last final with his least favorite professor, Prof. McDougal, who later delivers the news to Van that he passed. McDougal explains he had been so hard on him all those years because he believed Van was not living up to his potential, not because  Van had also hooked up with McDougal's daughter freshmen year. Gwen finishes her article on Van for the graduation issue revealing his many contributions to the students and staff of Coolidge in the last seven years, his superhuman accomplishment of doing a semester's worth of studying in just six days, and Richard's plot to have Van expelled; Richard is seen reading Gwen's article, his medical school dreams are ruined and his reputation is destroyed.\n\nThe university celebrates Van's graduation with a wild party held in his honor. His father, having read Gwen's article, admits he was wrong and expresses his pride in Van's success. Gwen arrives, lovingly reunites with Van.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Ryan Reynolds]] as Vance \"Van\" Wilder, Jr.\n* [[Tara Reid]] as Gwen Pearson\n* [[Kal Penn]] as Taj Mahal Badalandabad\n* [[Tim Matheson]] as Vance Wilder, Sr.\n* [[Paul Gleason]] as Professor McDougal\n* [[Daniel Cosgrove]] as Richard \"Dick\" Bagg\n* [[Teck Holmes]] as Hutch\n* [[Emily Rutherfurd]] as Jeannie\n* [[Curtis Armstrong]] as Campus Cop\n* [[Deon Richmond]] as \"Mini Cochran\"\n* Alex Burns as Gordon\n* [[Chris Owen (actor)|Chris Owen]] as Timmy\n* Ivana Bo\u017eilovi\u0107 as Naomi\n* [[Sophia Bush]] as Sally\n* Lydia Hull as Lindsey\n* Cynthia Fancher as Ms. Haver\n* [[Simon Helberg]] as Vernon\n* [[Quentin Richardson]] as \"Q\"\n* [[Michael Olowokandi]] as Leron\n* [[Darius Miles]] as Darius\n* [[Erik Estrada]] as Himself\n* [[Edie McClurg]] as Campus Tour Guide\n* [[Michael Waltman]] as Coach Ken Massey\n* [[Aaron Paul]] as Wasted Guy\n* Teresa Hill as Hot Female Doctor\n* [[Joyce Brothers|Dr. Joyce Brothers]] as Herself\n* [[Tom Everett Scott]] (''uncredited'') as Elliot Grebb\n* [[Walt Becker]] (''uncredited'') as Fireman\n* [[Lamar Odom]]  (''uncredited'') as Coolidge Chickandee Player\n}}\n\n==Soundtrack==\nThe soundtrack album was released on March 26, 2002.
