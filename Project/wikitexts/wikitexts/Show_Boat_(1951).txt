It was made by [[MGM]], adapted for the screen by [[John Lee Mahin]], produced by [[Arthur Freed]] and directed by [[George Sidney]].\n\nFilmed previously [[Show Boat (1929 film)|in 1929]] and [[Show Boat (1936 film)|in 1936]], this third adaptation of ''Show Boat'' was shot in [[Technicolor]] in the typical MGM lavish style, while the basic plot remains unchanged. The film stars [[Kathryn Grayson]], [[Ava Gardner]], and [[Howard Keel]], with [[Joe E. Brown]], [[Marge Champion]], [[Gower Champion]], [[William Warfield]], [[Robert Sterling]], [[Agnes Moorehead]] and [[Leif Erickson (actor)|Leif Erickson]]. Unlike the 1936 film, none of the members of the original Broadway cast of the show appeared in this version.\n\nThe 1951 ''Show Boat'' was the most financially successful of the film adaptations of the show: one of MGM's most popular musicals, it was the second highest-grossing film of that year.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Walker |first1=Lawrence |title=Show Boat (1951 film) |url=https://purehistory.org/show-boat-1951-film/ |website=Pure History}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nWhen the show boat ''Cotton Blossom'' arrives in a Mississippi town to give a performance, a fistfight breaks out between leading man Steve Baker and Pete, the boat's engineer who has been making passes at Steve's wife, leading lady Julie La Verne. Pete knows a dark secret about the couple: Julie is [[Multiracial people|part black]] and therefore their marriage is illegal. When Pete shows up with the town sheriff, Baker pricks Julie's finger and sucks blood from it, meaning he now has \"negro blood\" in him as well. Unfortunately, since black and white actors are not allowed onstage together, Cap'n Andy is forced to dismiss the Bakers along with Pete.\n\nJulie's best friend Magnolia becomes the new leading lady and riverboat gambler Gaylord Ravenal is hired as her leading man. The two become successful, fall in love, and marry. They leave the boat and move to [[Chicago]], where they live on Ravenal's gambling winnings until he goes broke and walks out on Magnolia.\n\nEllie Shipley and Frank Schultz, formerly the dance team on the show boat, take Magnolia to audition at the Trocadero nightclub, not realizing the club already has a singer: Julie Baker.  Julie overhears Magnolia audition, learns from the nightclub manager that Ravenal deserted her, and quits so that he will have no choice but to hire Magnolia. Cap'n Andy attends her opening night, where he helps Magnolia confidence conquer her [[stage fright]]. Magnolia reveals that she is pregnant with Ravenal's child. She returns to the show boat with Cap'n Andy, where she gives birth to a daughter, Kim.\n\nAbout five years pass. Ravenal is gambling on board a packet boat, on which a drunken Julie is trying to sing. After punching her escort because he slapped Julie, Ravenal goes out on deck. Julie, who has been keeping track of Magnolia, finds out who Ravenal is, and not realizing that he knew nothing of Magnolia's pregnancy, tells him off. Ravenal is overcome with guilt and returns to the show boat the next day, where he meets his little daughter Kim for the first time and returns to Magnolia, with whom he is reconciled.\n\n==Cast==\n(credited cast only)\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Kathryn Grayson]] as Magnolia Hawks\n* [[Ava Gardner]] as Julie LaVerne (singing voice dubbed by [[Annette Warren]])\n* [[Howard Keel]] as Gaylord Ravenal\n* [[Joe E.

The story was given a major overhaul, particularly near the end of the film. Changes included keeping the characters of Magnolia and Gaylord significantly younger at the end than in the play, and the expansion of the role of Julie to give her character greater depth. The film also somewhat sanitized the character of Gaylord Ravenal by having him leave Magnolia without finding out about her pregnancy. Kim (Magnolia and Ravenal's daughter) appears only as a baby and a little girl. Frank and Ellie, rather than being portrayed as unsophisticated, barely talented dancers as in the show, were made into a rather debonair couple in the style of [[Fred Astaire]] and [[Ginger Rogers]]. The aspects of the original stage version dealing with racial inequality, especially the story line concerning miscegenation, were highly sanitized and deemphasized, although the interracial subplot was retained.<ref name=\"Show Boat\">{{cite web |last1=Erickson |first1=Glenn |title=Show Boat |url=https://trailersfromhell.com/show-boat-1951/ |website=Trailers From Hell |access-date=7 February 2022 |date=2 March 2021}}</ref>\n\nNearly all of the purely comic scenes, retained in the 1936 film version, were removed in the 1951 film, as much of the comedy in the show has no direct bearing on the plot. According to William Bayer's book ''The Great Movies'', producer [[Arthur Freed]] maintained a strict policy of removing everything in the musicals that he produced if it did not advance the storyline.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Bayer |first1=William |title=The Great Movies |date=1 January 1973 |publisher=Grosset and Dunlap |isbn=978-0448221762}}</ref>\n\n==Production==\nAccording to George Sidney, MGM executives wanted [[Dinah Shore]] to play Julie. Sidney tested Shore but she \"wasn't right\" according to the director. So he tested Ava Gardner miming to a [[Lena Horne]] track and Gardner was cast.<ref>{{cite book|last=Davis|first=Ronald L.|page=[https://archive.org/details/justmakingmovies00davi/page/74 74]|title=Just Making Movies|url=https://archive.org/details/justmakingmovies00davi|url-access=registration|year=2005|publisher=University Press of Mississippi|isbn=9781578066902}}</ref>\n\nLena Horne was originally to have played Julie (after Dinah Shore and [[Judy Garland]] were passed over) as she had in the brief segment of the play featured in the 1946 Jerome Kern biopic ''[[Till the Clouds Roll By]]''. But studio executives were nervous about casting a glamorous black actress in one of the lead roles, so Gardner was chosen instead. After some unfavorable sneak previews using her real voice in her songs, Gardner's singing voice was [[Dubbing (filmmaking)|dubbed]] by vocalist [[Annette Warren]]. Gardner's vocals were included on the [[soundtrack]] album for the movie, and in an autobiography written not long before her death, Gardner reported she was still receiving royalties from the release.\n\nThe arrival of the boat was achieved by blending [[backlot]] footage showing the boat pulling in with location shots of crowds running along the bank of the real Mississippi River. The show boat itself remained moored on the [[MGM]] backlot. The full-scale [[Paddle steamer|stern-wheeler]] constructed on the backlot lake was sold off at the [[Film memorabilia|MGM property auctions]] for $15,000 in 1970 dollars.<ref name=\"Show Boat\"/>\n\n==Reception==\nContemporary reviews were positive. [[Bosley Crowther]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote a rave review, calling the film \"so magnificent in so many ways\" that it put the 1936 version \"in the shade,\" for no previous screen version of the stage musical had ever been presented \"in anything like the visual splendor and richness of musical score as are tastefully brought together in this brilliant re-creation of the show.\"<ref>{{cite journal |last=Crowther |first=Bosley |date=July 20, 1951 |title=The Screen: A Musical Favorite At Radio City |journal=[[The New York Times]] |page=14 }}</ref> ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' wrote that the film \"takes to Technicolor with an accord that makes it seem no other treatment would be possible. Freed has dealt out his physical production values with a lavish and elegant hand, dressing the presentation with a sight appeal in keeping with the tune worth, and they have been brilliantly captured on film by Charles Rosher's cameras.\"<ref>{{cite journal |date=June 6, 1951 |title=Show Boat |journal=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |page=6 }}</ref> ''[[Harrison's Reports]]'' called it \"excellent ... It has been filmed twice before, but the color photography makes this version far superior.\"<ref>{{cite journal |date=June 9, 1951 |title='Showboat' with Kathryn Grayson, Ava Gardner, Howard Keel and Joe E. Brown |journal=[[Harrison's Reports]] |page=91 }}</ref> [[Richard L.

Kathryn Grayson makes an indifferent Magnolia, Ava Gardner a bewildered and, at times, ludicrously over-empathic Julie. Only Howard Keel among the principal players suggests the dashing carefree charm needed for the part.\"<ref>{{cite journal |date=July 1951 |title=Show Boat |journal=[[The Monthly Film Bulletin]] |volume=18 |issue=210 |page=294 }}</ref>\n\nThe film was a commercial success. During its initial theatrical run it earned $5,293,000 in the US and Canada and $2,328,000 in the rest of the world, resulting in a profit of $2,337,000.<ref name=\"Mannix\"/>\n\nAmong recent critics, [[Garry Giddins]] stated that \"MGM made a brash, highly successful Technicolor show\", but \"cleansing the material of racial complexity, period authenticity, and general sophistication\" in contrast to other stage productions and the 1936 film. Giddins stated that it is \"not a terrible movie, but it\u2019s not much of a Show Boat, beyond introducing, in the greatly reduced part of Joe, the marvelous William Warfield (...)\".<ref>[https://www.criterion.com/current/posts/6875-show-boat-rollin-on-the-river Garry Giddins: Show Boat: Rollin on the River]</ref>\n\n==Television==\nThe film was first telecast on January 3, 1972, on ''[[The NBC Monday Movie]]''. This marked the first time any production of ''Show Boat'' was telecast, with the exception of an experimental telecast in 1931 of a scene from the 1929 film version. NBC repeated the film on Saturday June 17, 1972. Several years later, the film went to CBS, where it appeared twice as a holiday offering on ''[[The CBS Late Movie]]''. From there the film went to local stations and then to cable.\n\n==Radio adaptation==\n''Show Boat'' was presented on ''[[Lux Radio Theatre]]'' on February 11, 1952. The one-hour adaptation starred [[Ava Gardner]], [[Kathryn Grayson]], [[Howard Keel]], [[William Warfield]], [[Marge Champion]] and [[Gower Champion]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=Kirby|first1=Walter|title=Better Radio Programs for the Week|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/2540149/the_decatur_daily_review/|agency=The Decatur Daily Review|date=February 10, 1952|page=38|via=[[Newspapers.com]]|access-date=June 2, 2015|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150606204803/http://www.newspapers.com/clip/2540149/the_decatur_daily_review/|archive-date=June 6, 2015}} {{Open access}}</ref>\n\n==Music==\n* Main Title&nbsp;\u2014 MGM Studio Orchestra and Chorus (\"Cotton Blossom\" and an instrumental version of \"Make Believe\")\n* \"Cotton Blossom\" \u2014 [[Cotton Blossom Singers]] and Dancers\n* \"Capt' Andy's Ballyhoo\" \u2014 danced by Marge and Gower Champion (MGM Studio Orchestra)\n* \"Where's the Mate for Me\" \u2014 Howard Keel\n* \"[[Make Believe (Jerome Kern song)|Make Believe]]\" \u2014 Kathryn Grayson / Howard Keel\n* \"[[Can't Help Lovin' Dat Man]]\" \u2014 Ava Gardner\n* \"Can't Help Lovin' Dat Man\" (Reprise #1) \u2014 Kathryn Grayson / Ava Gardner\n* \"I Might Fall Back On You\" \u2014 Marge and Gower Champion\n* Julie Leaves the Boat (\"Mis'ry's Comin' Round\" \u2014 partial) - MGM Studio Orchestra and Chorus\n* \"[[Ol' Man River]]\" \u2014 William Warfield and MGM chorus\n* Montage sequence (\"Make Believe\") \u2014 MGM Studio Orchestra and Chorus\n* \"You Are Love\" \u2014 Kathryn Grayson / Howard Keel\n* \"Why Do I Love You\" \u2014 Kathryn Grayson / Howard Keel\n* \"[[Bill (Show Boat)|Bill]]\" \u2014 Ava Gardner\n* \"Can't Help Lovin' Dat Man\" (Reprise #2) \u2014 Kathryn Grayson\n* \"Life Upon the Wicked Stage\" \u2014 Marge and Gower Champion\n* \"After the Ball\" \u2014 Kathryn Grayson\n* \"Cakewalk\" \u2014 danced by Joe E.
