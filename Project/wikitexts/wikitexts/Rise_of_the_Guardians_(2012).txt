The film was directed by [[Peter Ramsey]] (in his feature directorial debut) from a screenplay by [[David Lindsay-Abaire]] based on the book series ''[[The Guardians of Childhood]]'' and the short film ''The Man in the Moon'' by [[William Joyce (writer)|William Joyce]]. It stars [[Chris Pine]], [[Alec Baldwin]], [[Jude Law]], [[Isla Fisher]], and [[Hugh Jackman]]. The film tells a story about Guardians [[Santa Claus]], the [[Tooth fairy|Tooth Fairy]], the [[Easter Bunny]], and the [[Sandman]], who enlist [[Jack Frost]] to stop the evil [[Bogeyman|Pitch Black]] from engulfing the world in darkness in a fight of dreams.\n\nThe film was released in the United States on November 21, 2012. It grossed $306.9 million worldwide against a budget of $145 million but lost an estimated $87 million due to marketing and distribution costs.<ref name=\"write-down\"/><ref name=\"layoffs\"/> It was nominated for the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Animated Feature Film]] and the [[Annie Award for Best Animated Feature]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Golden Globes 2013: full list of nominations|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/dec/13/golden-globes-2013-nominations-list|access-date=January 3, 2013|newspaper=guardian.co.uk|date=13 December 2012<!-- 14.32 GMT-->}}</ref>\n\nIt was the last DreamWorks Animation film to be distributed by Paramount Pictures.

Three hundred years later, Jack, as the Spirit of Winter, enjoys delivering snow days to schoolchildren, but still feels upset that they do not believe in him. At the [[North Pole]], the [[Man in the Moon]] warns [[Santa Claus|Nicholas St. North]] that [[Bogeyman|Pitch Black]] is threatening the children of the world with his nightmares. He calls [[Easter Bunny|E. Aster Bunnymund/Bunny]], the [[Sandman]], and the [[Tooth Fairy]] to arms. They are told that Jack Frost has been chosen to be a new Guardian, and Bunny brings him to the North Pole. North explains to Jack that every Guardian has a center, something they are the Guardian of, but a call for help from Tooth's fairies ends the conversation.\n\nVisiting Tooth's world, which resembles a palace in India, Jack learns that each and every [[baby teeth|baby tooth]] contains childhood memories of the children who lost it, Jack's teeth included. However, Pitch raids Tooth's home, kidnapping all of her subordinate tooth fairies except Baby Tooth and stealing all the teeth, thus preventing Tooth from sharing Jack's memories and weakening children's belief in her. In order to thwart Pitch's plan, the group decides to collect children's teeth. During their journey, a quarrel between North and Bunny awakens a boy, Jamie. Since he still believes, he can see everybody except for Jack. Pitch's nightmares then attack, provoking Sandy as the Guardian of Dreams. Jack tries to intervene, but Pitch overwhelms Sandy, who seemingly disappears.\n\nAs Easter approaches, the dejected Guardians gather in Bunny's home. With the unexpected aid of Jamie's little sister, Sophie, they begin the process of painting eggs for Easter. After Jack takes Sophie home, he is lured to Pitch's lair by a voice. Pitch taunts him with his memories and fear of non-belief, distracting him long enough for Pitch to destroy the eggs, causing children to stop believing in Bunny, who furiously berates Jack. With the Guardians' trust in him lost, a shamed Jack isolates himself in Antarctica, where Pitch tries to convince him to join his side. When Jack refuses, Pitch threatens to kill Baby Tooth unless Jack gives him his staff, the source of his magic. He agrees, but Pitch breaks Jack's staff and throws him down a chasm. Unlocking his memories inside his teeth, he learns that he was a mortal teenager who sacrificed himself to save his younger sister, dying from [[drowning]]. Inspired, Jack repairs his staff and returns to the lair to rescue the kidnapped tooth fairies.\n\nDue to Pitch, every child in the world except Jamie disbelieves, drastically weakening the Guardians. Finding Jamie's belief wavering, Jack makes it snow in his room, renewing Jamie's belief and letting him become the first person to ever believe in and see Jack. They gather Jamie's friends, whose renewed belief bolsters their fight against Pitch. He threatens them, but their dreams prove stronger than his nightmares, resulting in Sandy's resurrection and the Guardians reuniting. Defeated and no longer believed in, Pitch tries to retreat, but his nightmares, sensing his own fears, turn on him and drag him to the [[underworld]]. Afterward, Jamie and his friends bid goodbye to the Guardians as Jack accepts his place as the Guardian of Fun.\n\n==Cast and characters==\n* [[Chris Pine]] as [[Jack Frost]], the Spirit of Winter.<ref name=\"DreamWorks1\" /> Jack is a teenage hellion who enjoys creating mischief and has no interest in being bound by rules or obligations; he just wants to use his staff to spread his winter magic for the sake of fun, but also wants to be believed in.   Via his staff, he possesses potent [[Superpower (ability)|cryokinesis]]. At the end of the film, Jack became the Guardian of Fun. \n* [[Jude Law]] as [[Bogeyman|Pitch Black/The Boogeyman]], the essence of fear and the Nightmare King.

He lives at the [[North Pole]] in the Ice Castle and is served by loyal North Pole natives, the [[Yeti]]s (who built the castle and workshop) and the [[Christmas elf|Christmas Elves]].

And I also knew that during the progress of film production, a lot of things can change.
