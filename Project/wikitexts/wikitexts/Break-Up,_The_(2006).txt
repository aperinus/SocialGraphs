It was written by Jay Lavender and [[Jeremy Garelick]] and produced by [[Universal Pictures]].\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, the plot summary should be 400-700 words. -->\nGary Grobowski and Brooke Meyers meet at [[Wrigley Field]] during a [[Chicago Cubs]] game and begin dating, eventually buying a [[condominium]] together. Gary works as a [[tour guide]] in a family business with his brothers, Lupus and Dennis. Brooke manages an [[art gallery]] owned by eccentric artist Marilyn Dean.\n\nTheir relationship comes to a head after the latest in an escalating series of arguments. Brooke, feeling unappreciated, criticizes Gary's perceived immaturity and unwillingness to work on improving their relationship. Gary is frustrated by Brooke's perceived controlling, perfectionistic attitude, and expresses his desire to have a little more independence, particularly when arriving home from work, wanting to unwind.\n\nBrooke becomes irate when Gary fails to offer to help her clean up after a big dinner party at their home. Still frustrated from their earlier, unresolved argument, she breaks up with him (despite still being in love with him). Brooke seeks relationship advice from her friend Addie, while Gary goes to tell his side of things to friend Johnny Ostrofski.\n\nSince neither is willing to move out of their condo, they compromise by living as roommates; but each begins acting out to provoke the other in increasingly elaborate ways. Gary buys a pool table, litters the condo with food and trash, and even has a [[strip poker]] party with Lupus and a few women. Meanwhile, Brooke has Gary kicked off their \"couples-only\" bowling team and starts dating other men in an attempt to make Gary jealous.\n\nWhen their friend and [[realtor]] Mark Riggleman sells the condo, Gary and Brooke are given two weeks' notice to move out. Brooke invites Gary to an [[Old 97's]] concert, hoping that he will figure out that the gesture is meant to be her last-ditch attempt to salvage their relationship. Gary agrees to meet her there, but misses the hidden agenda, and misses the concert\u2014unwittingly breaking Brooke's heart. When Gary goes out for a drink with Johnny, his friend points out that Gary has always had his guard up, has been guilty of a lot of selfishness, and never gave Brooke a chance, emotional intimacy-wise.\n\nAfterwards, Brooke quits her job in order to spend time traveling [[Europe]]. When she brings a customer from the art gallery home one evening, Brooke finds the condo cleaned and Gary preparing a fancy dinner to win her back. He lays his heart on the line and promises to appreciate her more. Brooke becomes devastated and states that she just cannot give anymore, and, therefore, does not feel the same way. Gary seems to understand and kisses her before leaving. It is later revealed that Brooke's \"date\" (who initially asked her out, but she politely rejected) was actually a client interested in a piece of artwork she kept at the condo.\n\nBoth eventually move out of the condo. Gary begins taking a more active role in his tour guide business, while Brooke travels the world, eventually returning to Chicago. Sometime later, they meet again by chance on the street as Gary is bringing home groceries and Brooke is on her way to a meeting. After some awkward but friendly catching up, they part ways but each glances back over their shoulder and they share a smile.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Vince Vaughn]] as Gary Grobowski\n* [[Jennifer Aniston]] as Brooke Meyers\n* [[Jon Favreau]] as John \"Johnny O\" Ostrofski, a [[bartender]] and Gary's best friend.\n* [[Cole Hauser]] as Lupus Grobowski, Gary's brother and co-worker.\n* [[Joey Lauren Adams]] as Addie Jones, Brooke's best friend.\n* [[Judy Davis]] as Marilyn Dean, an artist, gallery owner, and Brooke's boss.\n* [[Justin Long]] as Christopher Hirons, a [[receptionist]] at Marilyn Dean's gallery.\n* [[Jason Bateman]] as Mark Riggleman, a realtor and friend of the couple.\n* [[Ivan Sergei]] as Carson Wingham, a client of the gallery who shows interest in Brooke.\n* [[Vincent D'Onofrio]] as Dennis Grobowski, Gary's other brother and boss.\n* [[John Michael Higgins]] as Richard Meyers, Brooke's brother.\n* Vernon Vaughn as Howard Meyers, Brooke's father.\n* [[Ann-Margret]] as Wendy Meyers, Brooke's mom.\n* [[Peter Billingsley]] as Andrew Jones, Addie's husband.\n* [[Mary-Pat Green]] as Mischa, Marilyn Dean's personal [[bikini waxing|waxer]].\n* [[Keir O'Donnell]] as Paul Grant, a friend of Andrew's and Brooke's date.\n* [[Geoff Stults]] as Mike Lawrence, another of Brooke's dates.\n* [[Linda Cohn]] as ESPN Sportscaster (voice)\n* [[Zack Shada]] as Mad Dawg Killa (voice)\n{{Div col end}}\n\n{{anchor|Box office|Critics}}\n\n==Reception ==\n===Box office===\nThe film grossed over $205 million worldwide, with a total of $118.7 million at the American box office.\n\n===Critical response===\n\nOn [[Rotten Tomatoes]] the film has an approval rating of 34% based on 192 reviews with an average rating of 5/10.
