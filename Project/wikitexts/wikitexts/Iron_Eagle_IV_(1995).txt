The film's opening scene is an alternate take on the scenario presented in ''[[Iron Eagle II]]'', wherein Masters survived after being shot down in Soviet airspace.{{TOC limit|limit=2}}\n\n==Plot==\nWhile on a routine [[F-16 Fighting Falcon variants#F-16C/D|F-16C]] fighter aircraft patrol in [[United States]] airspace west of [[Alaska]], Doug Masters and his wingman test the [[g-force]]s of their fighters but stray into [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] airspace. One of the Soviet aircraft has Doug on missile-lock, shooting him down. Doug safely ejects but is captured by Soviet soldiers.\n\nSeveral years later, Doug is still haunted by his days as a prisoner. Working as a [[crop duster]], he is recruited by old friend, retired Gen. Charles \"Chappy\" Sinclair as an instructor at his flight school. Chappy's school has teenagers who fly his [[North American T-6 Texan|Harvard IV]] trainers with no regard for safety. These teenagers in trouble with the law were taken in as a means of rehabilitating them.\n\nDuring an exhibition the young misfits face off against teens from the Air Force. Wheeler cons a drug dealer out of $2,000 by handing him a bag of sugar disguised as cocaine. With her co-pilot Rudy Marlowe she tries to  fly to Mexico. Doug pursues her and has her to land on an abandoned air force base. A platoon of armed men at the base try to kill them. Doug intervenes and tells Chappy about the incident. Chappy and Maj. Gen. Brad Kettle investigate the activity at a storage bunker revealed to be holding [[chemical weapons]].\n\nDoug leaves the school and Chappy is given a notice by the State Patrol that his flight program is terminated immediately with his students sent back to [[Youth detention center|juvenile hall]]. Wheeler steals a trainer, creating a diversion allowing students to hijack a bus and head back to the school. Chappy organizes the students to infiltrate the airbase and acquire enough resources to stop the convoy carrying the chemical weapons. Upon entering the airbase, Kitty Shaw and Chappy discover Operation Pandora was to use chemical weapons on hostile countries, like Cuba. They print out the data before leaving the premises and handing it to Kettle. Meanwhile, Dana Osborne and Rudy attempt to stop the convoy, but are shot down. As they attempt to escape on foot, Rudy is shot by Major Pierce, but Doug, Chappy and his team accompany Kettle to Craig Air Force Base, only to realize that Kettle is the ring-leader who captures the team.\n\nAfter Kettle leaves the chamber, Kitty hacks the computer setting off fire extinguishers, giving Chappy's team time to escape. A stray shot from one of the soldiers ruptures the canister, contaminating the chamber and killing Dr. Francis Gully and everyone inside. As Kitty and Peter sneak into the cargo plane carrying the chemical weapon, Chappy sends a radio message, warning everyone of a hostile aircraft heading to Cuba. Kettle orders his fighter squadron to shoot down the trainer aircraft. The squadron of two fighters attacks the trainers, only to be confronted by Doug, who has commandeered a fighter aircraft. Doug and the students shoot down the attackers.\n\nThe students approach the cargo plane and attack it. Inside, Peter Kane opens the cargo door, causing the soldiers aboard to fall out. Kitty assumes the controls. Peter then jettisons all of the canisters into the ocean. Seeing his mission as a failure, Kettle prepares to kill Chappy when Doug suddenly attacks the airbase, giving Chappy time to escape. As police arrive at the scene, Kettle enters the contaminated chamber - his fate unknown.\n\nDays later, Wheeler tells Doug she is heading to Mexico for a new start, but he convinces her to stay. The Iron Eagle Flight School then prepares for a new batch of students fresh out of juvenile hall.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Louis Gossett Jr.]] as Brigadier General Charles \"Chappy\" Sinclair (Ret.)\n* [[Jason Cadieux]] as Captain Doug \"Thumper\" Masters (Ret.)\n* [[Al Waxman]] as Major General Brad Kettle\n* [[Joanne Vannicola]] as Wheeler\n* [[Chas Lawther]] as Colonel Birkett\n* [[Marilyn Lightstone]] as Dr. Francis Gully\n* [[Victoria Snow]] as Amanda Kirke\n* [[Dean McDermott]] as Major Miles Pierce\n* [[Aidan Devine]] as Corporal Fincher\n* [[Jeff Pustil]] as Airman Cameron\n* Max Piersig as Peter Kane\n* Karen Gayle as Dana Osborne\n* [[Ross Hull]] as Malcolm Porter\n* [[Rachel Blanchard]] as Kitty Shaw\n* [[Dominic Zamprogna]] as Rudy Marlowe\n* [[Sean McCann (actor)|Sean McCann]] as Wilcox\n* [[Jason Blicker]] as Sergeant Osgood\n* J.D.
