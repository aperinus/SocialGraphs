It is a fictional tale about a young woman's desperate search for her fianc\u00e9 who might have been killed during [[World War I]]. It was based on the 1991 novel of the same name by [[S\u00e9bastien Japrisot]].\n\nThe film was nominated for the [[Academy Awards]] for [[Academy Award for Best Production Design|Best Art Direction]] and [[Academy Award for Best Cinematography|Best Cinematography]] at the [[77th Academy Awards]]. Marion Cotillard won the [[C\u00e9sar Awards|C\u00e9sar Award]] for Best Supporting Actress for her performance, and Gaspard Ulliel won the C\u00e9sar Award for Most Promising Actor.\n\n==Plot==\nFive French [[poilu|soldiers]] are convicted of self-mutilation in order to escape military service during [[World War I]]. They are condemned to face near-certain death in [[no man's land]] between the French and German [[Trench warfare|trench]] lines. It appears that all of them were killed in a subsequent battle, but Mathilde, the fianc\u00e9e of one of the soldiers, refuses to give up hope and begins to uncover clues as to what actually took place on the battlefield. She is all the while driven by the constant reminder of what her fianc\u00e9 had carved into one of the bells of the [[Church (building)|church]] near their home, MMM for ''Manech Aime Mathilde'' (Manech Loves Mathilde; a pun on the French word ''aime'', which is pronounced like the letter \"M\". In the English-language version, this is changed to \"Manech's Marrying Mathilde\").\n\nAlong the way, she discovers the brutally corrupt system used by the [[Cabinet of France|French government]] to deal with those who tried to escape the front. She also discovers the stories of the other men who were sentenced to no man's land as a punishment. She, with the help of a private investigator, Germain Pire, attempts to find out what happened to her fianc\u00e9. The story is told both from the point of view of the fianc\u00e9e in [[Paris]] and the French countryside\u2014mostly [[Brittany]]\u2014of the 1920s, and through flashbacks to the battlefield.\n\nEventually, Mathilde finds out her fianc\u00e9 is alive, but he suffers from amnesia. Seeing Mathilde, Manech seems to be oblivious of her. At this, Mathilde sits on the garden chair silently watching Manech with tears in her eyes and a smile on her lips.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Audrey Tautou]] \u2013 Mathilde Donnay\n* [[Gaspard Ulliel]] \u2013 Manech Langonnet, Mathilde's fianc\u00e9\n* [[Dominique Pinon]] \u2013 Sylvain, Mathilde's uncle\n* [[Chantal Neuwirth]] \u2013 B\u00e9n\u00e9dicte, Mathilde's aunt\n* {{ill|Jean-Pierre Becker|fr|Jean-Pierre Becker}} \u2013 Sergeant Daniel Esperanza\n* {{ill|Dominique Bettenfeld|fr|Dominique Bettenfeld}} \u2013 Angel Bassignano\n* [[Clovis Cornillac]] \u2013 Beno\u00eet Notre-Dame\n* [[Marion Cotillard]] \u2013 Tina Lombardi\n* [[Jean-Pierre Darroussin]] \u2013 Corporal Benjamin \"Biscotte\" Gordes\n* [[Julie Depardieu]] \u2013 V\u00e9ronique Passavant\n* [[Jean-Claude Dreyfus]] \u2013 Major Fran\u00e7ois Lavrouye\n* [[Andr\u00e9 Dussollier]] \u2013 Pierre-Marie Rouvi\u00e8res\n* [[Ticky Holgado]] \u2013 Germain Pire\n* [[Tch\u00e9ky Karyo]] \u2013 Captain Etienne Favourier\n* [[J\u00e9r\u00f4me Kircher]] \u2013 Kl\u00e9ber \"Bastoche\" Bouquet\n* [[Denis Lavant]] \u2013 Francis \"Six-Sous\" Gaignard\n* [[Urbain Cancelier]] \u2013 The monk\n* [[Jean-Paul Rouve]] \u2013 The postman\n* [[Michel Vuillermoz]] \u2013 P'tit Louis\n* [[Albert Dupontel]] \u2013 C\u00e9lestin Poux\n* [[Bouli Lanners]] \u2013 Corporal Urbain Chardolot\n* [[Philippe Duquesne]] \u2013 Favart\n* [[Fran\u00e7ois Levantal]] \u2013 Gaston Thouvenel\n* St\u00e9phane Butet \u2013 Julien Phillipot\n* {{ill|Thierry Gibault|fr|Thierry Gibault}} \u2013 Lieutenant Beno\u00eet Etrangin\n* [[Jodie Foster]] \u2013 \u00c9lodie Gordes\n* [[Rufus (actor)|Rufus]] \u2013 The Breton\n* [[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9rique Bel]] \u2013 A prostitute\n* [[Elina L\u00f6wensohn]] \u2013 German woman\n* [[Michel Robin]] \u2013 old man on the battlefield\n}}\n\n==Production and release==\n''A Very Long Engagement'' was filmed entirely in France over an 18-month period,<ref name=\"screendaily\">{{Cite web |last=Frater |first=Patrick |date=26 November 2004 |title=French court breaks off Engagement |url=https://www.screendaily.com/french-court-breaks-off-engagement/4021090.article |website=Screen Daily}}</ref> with about 30 French actors, approximately 500 French technicians and more than 2,000 French extras.<ref name=\"nyt2004\">{{cite web| title= Arts, Briefly | author= [[Ben Sisario]] (compiler)|  url= https://www.nytimes.com/2004/11/27/arts/movies/arts-briefly.html | agency= [[Agence France-Presse]]| date= November 27, 2004| work=The New York Times| access-date=2011-10-26}}</ref><ref name=\"screendaily\"/> Right before the film's New York City and Hollywood debut, the film's production company (\"2003 Productions\"), which is one-third owned by Warner Brothers and two-thirds owned by Warner France, was ruled an American production company by a French court, denying the studio $4.8 million in government incentives,.<ref name=\"nyt2004\"/> The ruling is consistent with the fact that Warner France is owned by Warner Spain,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=5545397|title=Warner Bros Entertainment France S.A.S.: Private Company Information - Bloomberg|website=www.bloomberg.com|access-date=2017-07-28}}</ref> which is owned by Warner Nederland,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=35419927|title=Warner Bros.Entertainment Espa\u00f1a, S.L.: Private Company Information - Bloomberg|website=www.bloomberg.com|access-date=2017-07-28}}</ref> itself a subsidiary of Warner Brothers.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=22987824|title=Warner Bros.
