Featuring a wealth of modern conveniences, the building allows its residents to become gradually uninterested in the outside world. The infrastructure begins to fail and tensions between residents become apparent, and the building soon descends into chaos.\n\nIn September 2015, the film received its world premi\u00e8re at the [[2015 Toronto International Film Festival|Toronto International Film Festival]] and its European premi\u00e8re at the 63rd [[San Sebasti\u00e1n International Film Festival|San Sebasti\u00e1n Film Festival]]. The film was released in the United Kingdom on 18 March 2016 by [[StudioCanal]]. Though a modest critical success, the film's theatrical box office failed to meet its production costs.<ref name=\"wsj\">{{cite news |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/high-rise-filming-the-unfilmable-ballard-1462469027 | title='High Rise': Filming the 'Unfilmable' Ballard| work=The Wall Street Journal | date=5 May 2016| access-date=4 August 2016| last1=Russell| first1=Anna}}</ref><ref name=\"mojo\" /> In 2017 it was nominated for the [[Empire Awards|Empire Award]] for [[Empire Award for Best British Film|Best British Film]].\n\n==Plot==\nThe film opens with Dr Robert Laing living in a ravaged high-rise [[tower block]], killing a dog and spit-roasting its leg.\n\nThree months earlier, the 40-story tower on the outskirts of [[London]], built by esteemed architect Anthony Royal, is the epitome of chic, modern living. Wealthy residents live on the top floors, and poorer residents live below. With amenities including a pool, gym, spa, supermarket, and primary school, the occupants have little reason to leave the building beyond working hours and become increasingly isolated from the outside world.\n\nLaing, who moves onto the 25th floor after his sister dies, begins a sexual relationship with single mother Charlotte Melville and becomes a father figure to her son, Toby. Laing also befriends documentary filmmaker Richard Wilder and his pregnant wife Helen, who live in a low-level apartment with their children.\n\nWhile Laing leads a [[physiology]] class in examining a severed head, a student named Munrow faints and is given a precautionary brain scan. The next day, Laing is taken to the 40th-story penthouse to meet Royal, who invites him to a party thrown by his snobby wife, Ann.\n\nThe gathering turns out to be an 18th-century [[costume party]] where Laing's everyday suit is ridiculed by Ann and other guests, including Munrow, who also lives in the building. Humiliated, Laing is thrown out of the party and becomes trapped in an elevator during a power outage. Such outages are becoming common, along with water being shut off and garbage chutes becoming blocked, to the annoyance of residents. Royal tells Laing these are simply growing pains of a new building.\n\nMunrow's brain scans come back clean, but a vengeful Laing leads him to believe he has a brain tumor. Another power outage ignites a night of decadent partying throughout the high-rise, and a drunk Munrow commits [[suicide]] by jumping off the 39th floor. Suspicious that no police arrive to investigate, Wilder becomes intent on exposing the injustices within the high-rise.\n\nLaw and order in the building disintegrate as violence and debauchery become commonplace, garbage piles up, food becomes scarce, and class warfare erupts between floors. Laing shows signs of mental disturbance, savagely beating a man, barricading himself in his apartment, and having sex with Helen.\n\nWilder, having been beaten by upper-floor residents, decides to kill Royal, believing him responsible for the chaos. It is implied that Royal has bribed authorities to ignore the disorder. Acquiring a gun from the Royal's former housekeeper, Wilder learns that Toby is Royal's illegitimate child. Breaking into Charlotte's apartment, Wilder tortures and rapes her for information on Royal. A television newsreader named Cosgrove, the only upper-floor resident who still leaves for work, is killed by a gang of lower-floor residents.\n\nSome upper-floor residents butcher Ann's horse for meat and ask Laing to [[lobotomy|lobotomize]] Wilder as a dangerous [[Demonstration (protest)|agitator]]. After conducting a [[Mental status examination|psychiatric examination]], Laing refuses, stating that Wilder is \"possibly the sanest man in the building\". Laing is nearly thrown off the tower, but Royal intervenes. He surmises to Laing that the failure of the high-rise may actually be a kind of success, a \"crucible for change\" that could lead residents to escape to a new life. Helen gives birth to her overdue baby. Wilder makes his way to the penthouse, and after a confrontation with Royal, shoots him dead. Wilder is then stabbed to death by Royal's women, as Toby looks on through his kaleidoscope.\n\nThe film ends as it began in the ravaged high-rise. Violence has abated somewhat since many residents are dead or have fled. Laing appears to have gone insane, speaking about himself and to others in the third person. He lies down with Charlotte, reflecting that what has happened will eventually occur in the second tower of the development. The film concludes with Toby listening to a radio broadcast of [[Margaret Thatcher]] declaring that \"where there is state capitalism there can never be political freedom.\"\n\n==Cast==\n<!--- Cast and order and their roles per tombstone closing credits --->\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Tom Hiddleston]] as Robert Laing\n* [[Jeremy Irons]] as Anthony Royal\n* [[Sienna Miller]] as Charlotte Melville\n* [[Luke Evans (actor)|Luke Evans]] as Richard Wilder\n* [[Elisabeth Moss]] as Helen Wilder\n* [[James Purefoy]] as Pangbourne\n* [[Keeley Hawes]] as Ann Royal\n* [[Peter Ferdinando]] as Cosgrove\n* [[Sienna Guillory]] as Jane\n* [[Reece Shearsmith]] as Steele\n* [[Enzo Cilenti]] as Adrian Talbot\n* [[Augustus Prew]] as Munrow\n* [[Dan Renton Skinner|Dan Skinner]] as Simmons\n* [[Stacy Martin]] as Fay\n* [[Tony Way]] as Robert the Caretaker\n* [[Leila Mimmack]] as Laura\n* [[Bill Paterson (actor)|Bill Paterson]] as Mercer\n* [[Victoria Wicks]] as Miriam\n}}\n\n==Production==\n\n===Development===\nBritish producer [[Jeremy Thomas]] had wanted to make a [[film adaptation]] of [[J.G.
