A [[Hairspray (2007 film)|second film version]] of ''Hairspray'', an [[Film adaptation|adaptation]] of the stage musical, was also released by [[New Line Cinema]] in 2007, which included many changes of scripted items from the original.\n\n==Plot==\nIn [[Baltimore]], [[Maryland]] in the year 1962, Tracy Turnblad and her best friend, Penny Pingleton, audition for ''The Corny Collins Show'', a popular Baltimore teenage dance show (based on the real-life ''[[The Buddy Deane Show|Buddy Deane Show]]'').<ref>John Waters Commentary ''Hairspray'' DVD</ref> Penny nervously stumbles over her answers, and another girl, Nadine Carver, is cut for being Black (the show has a \"Negro Day\" on the last Thursday of every month, she is told). However, despite being overweight, Tracy is a beautiful and strong enough dancer to become a regular on the show, infuriating the show's reigning queen, Amber Von Tussle, a mean, privileged, equally beautiful high school classmate whose racist parents, Velma and Franklin Von Tussle, own Tilted Acres Amusement Park which bans [[African American]]s. Tracy steals Amber's boyfriend, Link Larkin, and competes against her for the title of Miss Auto Show 1963, fuelling Amber's hatred of her.\n\nTracy's growing confidence leads to her being hired as a plus-size model for the Hefty Hideaway clothing store owned by Mr. Pinky. She is also inspired to bleach, tease, and rat her [[big hair]] into styles popular in the 1960s. At school, a geometry teacher brands her hairdo a \"hair-don't\" and sends her to the principal's office, from which Tracy is sent to [[special education]] classes, where she befriends Black classmates sent there to hold them back academically. The students introduce Tracy to Motormouth Maybelle, an [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]] record shop owner and host of the monthly \"Negro Day\" on ''The Corny Collins Show''. They teach Tracy, Penny, and Link dance moves such as ''The Bird'' and ''The Dirty Boogie'' and Penny begins an [[Interracial relationship|interracial romance]] with Motormouth Maybelle's son, Seaweed. This horrifies Penny's parents, Prudence and Paddy, who imprison her in her bedroom and hire [[quackery|quack]] [[Psychiatry|psychiatrist]] Dr. Frederickson to [[Brainwashing|brainwash]] her into dating White boys and opposing integration. Seaweed later helps her break out of the house and run away, and it is implied that her parents have disowned her.\n\nUndeterred, Tracy uses her newfound fame to advocate for [[racial integration]], aided by Motormouth Maybelle, Corny Collins, his assistant Tammy, and her own [[Agoraphobia|agoraphobic]], slightly overbearing, overweight mother, Edna. After a [[race riot]] at Tilted Acres, where ''The Corny Collins Show'' is live from that day, results in Tracy's arrest, the Von Tussles grow more defiantly opposed to racial integration. Their plot to sabotage the Miss Auto Show 1963 pageant with a bomb hidden in Velma's towering bouffant wig literally backfires when the bomb detonates prematurely, and the Von Tussles are captured by the Baltimore police for their [[hate crime]]s. Tracy, who had won the crown but was disqualified for being in reform school, dethrones Amber after the governor of Maryland pardons her. She then comes to the pageant, integrates ''The Corny Collins Show'', and encourages everyone to dance in celebration.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Ricki Lake]] as Tracy Turnblad, an optimistic, aspirational teenager who hopes to dance on a TV show as well as promote integration.\n* [[Divine (performer)|Divine]] as Edna Turnblad, Tracy's kind, plus-sized mother who is ashamed of her obesity and as Arvin Hodgepile, the rival TV station owner who is against racial integration for his studio.\n* [[Debbie Harry]] as Velma Von Tussle, Franklin's wife and Amber's mother.\n* [[Sonny Bono]] as Franklin Von Tussle, Velma's husband and Amber's father.\n* [[Jerry Stiller]] as Wilbur Turnblad, Tracy's loving, funny and encouraging father.\n* Leslie Ann Powers as Penelope \"Penny\" Pingleton, Tracy's shy best friend.\n* [[Vitamin C (singer)|Colleen Fitzpatrick]] as Amber Von Tussle, snobby dancer on ''The Corny Collins Show''.\n* [[Michael St. Gerard]] as Lincoln \"Link\" Larkin, a teenage heartthrob, Tracy's boyfriend, and Amber's ex-boyfriend.\n* Clayton Prince as Seaweed J.

''Hairspray'' was his only film with Waters in which he didn't play the lead. Originally, Divine was considered to play both Tracy Turnblad and her mother Edna. Executives from New Line Cinema, the film's distributor, discouraged this concept, and it was eventually dropped.<ref>{{cite book|last=Egan|first=James|title=John Waters: Interviews|date=13 September 2011|publisher=University Press of Mississippi|isbn=9781617031823|pages=xxiii |edition=Paperback}}</ref> Instead Divine played Edna Turnblad and Arvin Hodgepile, the racist TV station manager.\n\nAccording to BusinessInsider.com, ''Hairspray'' became the most popular movie set in Maryland.\n\n===Deleted scenes===\nA handful of scenes were cut while in post-production, some of which provided context for certain plot developments seen in the finished film.\n\nThe first scene occurs before Tracy and Penny go the Parkville VFW record hop. Tracy is required to start her first shift working in the Hardy-Har Joke Shop. But after managing to scare away all her customers she is excused to go to the hop. The joke shop customers are still listed in the end credits of the final cut.\n\nAn additional scene that was removed shows Tracy skipping school, stealing shoes from the Etta Gown Shop, breaking into the Von Tussles' home, and using a bottle of Amber's peroxide to bleach her hair in Amber's sink, thus explaining Tracy's subsequent change of hair color when she auditions for ''The Corny Collins Show''.<ref name=\"DVD Commentary\"/>\n\nAnother deleted scene involved cockroaches being placed in Tracy's hair. Although removed prior to the film's theatrical release, numerous references to the incident remain in the final edit, including the songs \"The Roach\" (1961) by Gene and Wendell and \"The Bug\" (1958) by Jerry Dallman and the Knightcaps, as well as Tracy arriving to be crowned \"Miss Auto Show\" wearing an evening gown appliqued with black satin cockroaches. When discussing his decision to ultimately cut the scene, Waters explained \"[[Robert Shaye|Bob Shaye]], the head of New Line, probably correctly, said 'This doesn't work. What is this, a [[Luis Bu\u00f1uel|Bu\u00f1uel]] movie?'...And he was probably right.\"<ref name=\"DVD Commentary\"/>\n\nThe final deleted scene was a musical number which depicted the teens performing an obscure 1960s dance called \"The Stupidity\" at the auto show just before Tracy's being released from reform school, but again, Waters ultimately decided it wasn't appropriate, stating \"I thought, you know, you don't want your leading man to look stupid right in the big finale.\"<ref name=\"DVD Commentary\"/>\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Critical response===\n''Hairspray'' received three stars from critics [[Gene Siskel]]<ref>{{Cite news |last=Siskel |first=Gene |author-link=Gene Siskel |date=February 26, 1988 |title=Flick of Week: `Frantic` is Tension and Slapstick |work=Chicago Tribune |url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1988-02-26-8804020590-story.html |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211222034755/https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1988-02-26-8804020590-story.html |archive-date=December 22, 2021}}</ref> and [[Roger Ebert]].<ref>{{cite news |last=Ebert |first=Roger |author-link=Roger Ebert |date=February 26, 1988 |title=Hairspray |work=RogerEbert.com |publisher=Ebert Digital LLC |url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/hairspray-1988 |access-date=April 10, 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe film holds a 98% \"certified fresh\" rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 42 reviews with an average rating of 7.8/10.
