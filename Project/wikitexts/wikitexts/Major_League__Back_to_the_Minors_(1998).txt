It is the third installment in the ''Major League'' film series (following 1989's ''[[Major League (film)|Major League]]'' and 1994's ''[[Major League II]]'') and is considered as a standalone sequel.\n\n== Plot ==\nAging minor league pitcher Gus Cantrell, who plays for the [[Fort Myers Miracle]], is ejected from the game following the \"frozen ball trick\". Roger Dorn, now the owner of the [[Minnesota Twins]], recruits Gus to be the manager of [[Salt Lake Bees|the Buzz]], the Twins' [[Triple-A (baseball)|AAA]] [[minor league]] affiliate. Gus's mission is to make a real team out of a bunch of players who include ballet dancer turned ballplayer Lance \"The Dance\" Pere, minor league lifer Frank \"Pops\" Morgan, Rube Baker, Taka Tanaka, Pedro Cerrano, pitcher Hog Ellis, home run hitter Billy \"Downtown\" Anderson, and pitcher Carlton \"Doc\" Windgate, a medical school graduate who throws the slowest fastball in the minors.\n\nHowever, Gus clashes with Leonard Huff, the snobby manager of the Twins. One night in Minnesota, Gus and his fiancee Maggie Reynolds are having dinner with Roger and Huff at an upscale restaurant, where Huff challenges Gus to a game between the Buzz and the Twins. Gus accepts the challenge.\n\nThe game is scheduled to take place at the [[Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome]] in Minnesota. The Twins take a 3-0 lead in the 6th inning, but Downtown hits a home run that ties the game at 3-3 in the 8th inning.  But with two outs in the bottom of the 9th inning, and with Doc one strike away from striking out home run hitter Carlos Liston, Huff has the stadium's lights turned off so the game can end with a tie rather than give the Buzz a chance to win in extra innings. However, the media reports that the Twins were still outplayed by the Buzz.\n\nHuff now wants to bring Downtown up to the Twins, even though Gus believes that he is not yet ready. However, Anderson jumps on the opportunity, turning his back on Gus. Without Downtown, the Buzz start losing again. With the Twins, Anderson starts hitting poorly, proving Huff wrong. Gus manages to get the Buzz back on track, and Downtown is sent back down to the Buzz, where Gus teaches him how to be a more well rounded hitter. Gus leads the Buzz to a division title in their league.\n\nGus issues a challenge for Huff to bring the Twins to Buzz Stadium for another game. If the Twins win, Gus will give his salary for the year to Huff. If Gus and the Buzz beat the Twins, Gus can take over as the manager of the Twins. Huff accepts the challenge and takes the Twins to play against the Buzz. This time, the Twins take a 4-0 lead in the 6th inning, but the Buzz still manage to come from behind with three runs, and then win the game, 5-4, thanks to a game-winning two-run home run by Downtown. Gus decides that he wants to stay with the Buzz so he can continue to work with minor league players on their skills and hopefully turn them into stars.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Corbin Bernsen]] as Roger Dorn\n* [[Scott Bakula]] as Gus Cantrell\n* [[Bob Uecker]] as Harry Doyle\n* [[Kenny Johnson]] as Lance \"The Dance\" Pere\n* [[Thom Barry]] as Frank \"Pops\" Morgan\n* [[Eric Bruskotter]] as Rube Baker\n* [[Takaaki Ishibashi]] as Taka Tanaka\n* [[Dennis Haysbert]] as Pedro Cerrano\n* [[Judson Mills]] as Hog Ellis\n* [[Walton Goggins]] as Billy \"Downtown\" Anderson\n* [[Peter Mackenzie]] as Carlton \"Doc\" Windgate\n* [[Ted McGinley]] as Leonard Huff\n* [[Jensen Daggett]] as Maggie Reynolds\n* [[Steve Yeager]] as Duke Temple\n* Lobo Sebastian as Carlos Liston\n}}\n\n== Reception ==\n===Box office===\nThe film [[Box-office bomb|flopped at the box office]], grossing only $3.6 million in ticket sales<ref>{{cite news |title= Angels Stays Aloft in Top Spot|work= [[Los Angeles Times]] |url= http://articles.latimes.com/1998/apr/21/entertainment/ca-41370|access-date=2012-07-08}}</ref> against a budget of $18 million.\n\n===Critical response===\nOn [[Rotten Tomatoes]] the film holds an approval rating of 21% based on 19 reviews.<ref name=\"tomatoes\">{{cite web |title= Major League: Back to the Minors (1998) |url= https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/major_league_back_to_the_minors |website= [[Rotten Tomatoes]] }}</ref> Audiences polled by [[CinemaScore]] gave the film an average grade of \"B\u2212\" on an A+ to F scale.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cinemascore.com|title=Find CinemaScore|format=Type \"Major League\" in the search box|publisher=[[CinemaScore]]|access-date=September 25, 2021}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title= FILM REVIEW; Ploys of Summer: Underdogs Make Miracles|work= The New York Times|url= https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9D0DEFDD123CF93BA25757C0A96E958260|access-date=2012-07-09}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title= MOVIE REVIEW:Major League: Back to the Minors|work= Los Angeles Times|url= http://www.latimes.com/cl-movie980420-1,0,7430068.story|archive-url= https://archive.today/20130127113955/http://www.latimes.com/cl-movie980420-1,0,7430068.story|url-status= dead|archive-date= 2013-01-27|access-date=2012-07-09}}</ref>\n\n==Possible sequel==\n[[David S.
