The film is an American remake of the 1975 [[France|French]] comedy ''[[Cousin Cousine]]'', directed by [[Jean-Charles Tacchella]]. It was filmed in [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]], Canada, but set in Seattle, Washington.\n\n== Plot ==\nLarry Kozinski (Danson) and Maria Hardy (Rossellini) meet at the wedding of Larry's uncle Phil and Maria's widowed mother Edie (Aleandro). The newly-made cousins-by-marriage begin talking before realizing both their spouses, Tish and Tom, are missing. Tish (Sean Young) and boorish Tom (Petersen) finally appear claiming Tom, an auto salesman, was showing Tish a car and it broke down. Tom, a serial cheater, breaks off all his illicit relationships, then visits Tish, a make-up consultant, wanting to sleep with her again, though she brushes him off. Shortly after the wedding, Phil suddenly passes away during a large family gathering. Phil's brother, Vince, arrives for the funeral. He offers to buy Phil's business from Edie, who he is immediately attracted to.\n\nA few weeks later, Maria meets with Larry to discuss Tish and Tom's affair. Larry initially acts nonchalant, then explodes in anger. When Maria arrives home, she tells Tom she had lunch with Larry, knowing it will upset him. Maria and Larry continue to meet, but commit to just being friends. They arrange to \"accidentally\" run into each other at a restaurant. Their spouses, Maria's mother, Edie, and Larry's dad, Vince, and son, Mitch are present. Everyone ends up sitting together. Tish abruptly leaves the table after seeing Larry and Maria flirtatiously gazing at each other. Maria follows Tish into the bathroom and sweetly explains that she and Larry were only playing a game to get back at her and Tom. She says it went too far and apologizes. Tish is touched by Maria's kindness.\n\nOver time, Larry and Maria realize they are falling in love, and, one afternoon, they finally consummate their affair. Maria returns home late, and Tom obviously knows where she was. She confronts him about his infidelities and admits she loves Larry. Tom then calls Larry's house and threatens him. Larry's father, Vince, who was sleeping, answers the phone, and believes it is his brother, Phil calling from beyond the grave to warn him away from Edie. Larry returns from his day with Maria to discover that Tish is leaving; she wishes him well and they part amicably. Tish and Tom meet up at a hotel, but Tish notices Tom's changed behavior, but realizes he only wants temporary affairs, storms out.\n\nMaria learns that her young daughter, Chloe has been instigating fights at school as a way of acting out. Maria ends her affair with Larry, saying she needs to devote herself to Chloe and her marriage.\n\nVince urges Larry to do what makes him happy, while he tells Edie that he loves her. At Vince and Edie's wedding, Larry sees Maria and asks her to dance, then to spend the rest of her life with him. Tom, overhearing this, angrily threatens to leave her. Maria chooses to be with Larry. In an epilogue, Larry and Maria are seen sailing away with their children, living a dream they both shared.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Ted Danson]] as Larry Kozinski\n* [[Isabella Rossellini]] as Maria Hardy\n* [[Sean Young]] as Tish Kozinski\n* [[William Petersen]] as Tom Hardy\n* [[Lloyd Bridges]] as Vincent Kozinski\n* [[Norma Aleandro]] as Edie Hardy Kozinski\n* [[Keith Coogan]] as Mitch Kozinski\n* Gina DeAngeles as Aunt Sofia\n* [[George Coe]] as Phil Kozinski\n* [[Katharine Isabelle]] as Chloe Hardy (as Katie Murray)\n\n== Production ==\nThe film was directed by Joel Schumacher, known mostly for his works ''[[St. Elmo's Fire (film)|St. Elmo's Fire]]'' and ''[[The Lost Boys]]''. Although not identified as such, the locations were primarily shot around [[Vancouver]], Canada, among the first times the city was featured so prominently, and led to the city being used as a film location much more.  The score was composed by [[Angelo Badalamenti]], who was extremely popular at the time from his work with ''[[Twin Peaks]]'' and ''[[Blue Velvet (film)|Blue Velvet]]'' director [[David Lynch]]. ''Film Score Monthly'' described Badalamenti's melodic score as a definite asset to the film, underscoring several scenes with comical, Henry Mancini-like cues, and others with a delicate, poignant theme that blossoms into a waltz over the end credits.<ref>[http://www.filmscoremonthly.com/articles/2002/14_Feb---Back_to_Beverly_Hills.asp Film Score Monthly] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080504111422/http://www.filmscoremonthly.com/articles/2002/14_Feb---Back_to_Beverly_Hills.asp |date=2008-05-04 }}</ref>\n\n== Reception ==\nThe film has received mixed reviews.
