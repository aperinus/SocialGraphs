The history presented is broken up into parts, approximately the length of a decade, each of which is introduced by paraphrasing the official attitude towards marijuana at the time (e.g. \"Marijuana will make you insane\" or \"Marijuana will make you addicted to heroin\"), and closed by providing a figure for the amount of money spent during that period on the \"[[War on Drugs|war on marijuana]].\"\n\nThe film places much of the blame for marijuana criminalization on [[Harry J. Anslinger|Harry Anslinger]] (the first American drug czar) who promoted false information about marijuana to the American public as a means towards abolition. It later shows how the federal approach to criminalization became more firmly entrenched after [[Richard Nixon]] declared a \"[[War on Drugs]]\" and created the [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] in 1973, and even more so a decade later and on, as [[First Lady of the United States|First Lady]] [[Nancy Reagan]] introduced the \"[[Just Say No]]\" campaign and [[President of the United States|President]] [[George H. W. Bush]] accelerated the War on Drugs. The film ends during the [[Bill Clinton]] administration, which had accelerated spending even further on the War on Drugs.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Ebert|first=Roger|title=Grass movie review & film summary (2000) {{!}} Roger Ebert|url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/grass-2000|url-status=live|access-date=2021-05-26|website=Roger Ebert|language=en}}</ref>\n\n''Grass'' is almost completely composed of archival footage, much of which is from [[public domain]] [[United States|U.S.]] [[propaganda film]]s and such feature films as ''[[Reefer Madness]]'',<ref>{{Cite web|title=Grass|url=https://ew.com/article/2000/06/09/grass/|access-date=2021-05-26|website=EW.com|language=en}}</ref> as it also served as a portrait of marijuana in popular media.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Grass|url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/527053/grass|access-date=2021-05-26|website=www.tcm.com|language=en}}</ref>\n\nThe art director and poster designer of the film was [[Paul Mavrides]].\n\n==Critical reception==\nThe film was generally well received by critics, scoring 64 out of 100 in [[Metacritic]],<ref>[https://www.metacritic.com/video/titles/grass?q=Grass Grass (2000): Reviews<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> and a rating of 75% on [[Rotten Tomatoes]].<ref>{{Citation|title=Grass (1999)|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/grass|work=Rotten Tomatoes|language=en|access-date=2021-05-26}}</ref>\n\nThe film won Canada's [[Genie Award]] for Best Documentary.<ref>{{Cite news|title=It's a Maelstrom at the Genie awards|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/its-a-maelstrom-at-the-genie-awards/article1029883/|access-date=2021-05-26}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Cannabis|Film}}\n* [[Decriminalization of marijuana in the United States]]\n* [[Legal and medical status of cannabis]]\n* [[Legal history of marijuana in the United States]]\n* [[Cannabis rescheduling in the United States|Marijuana rescheduling in the United States]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{Amg movie|181372|Grass}}\n*{{IMDb title|id=0214730|title=Grass}}\n*{{rotten-tomatoes|id=1097829-grass|title=Grass}}\n* [https://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=grass.htm ''Grass''] at [[Box Office Mojo]]\n* [https://vimeo.com/157757505 Trailer]\n\n{{ACCT Best Documentary Film}}\n{{Ron Mann}}\n{{Cannabis in Canada}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:1999 documentary films]]\n[[Category:Collage film]]\n[[Category:1999 films]]\n[[Category:1999 in cannabis]]\n[[Category:Best Documentary Film Genie and Canadian Screen Award winners]]\n[[Category:Canadian documentary films]]\n[[Category:Cannabis law reform]]\n[[Category:Documentary films about cannabis]]\n[[Category:English-language Canadian films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Ron Mann]]\n[[Category:Canadian films about cannabis]]\n[[Category:1990s English-language films]]\n[[Category:1990s Canadian films]]"}]}}}}
