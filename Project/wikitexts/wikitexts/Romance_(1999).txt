It stars [[Caroline Ducey]], [[Rocco Siffredi]], [[Sagamore St\u00e9venin]] and [[Fran\u00e7ois Berl\u00e9and]]. The film features explicit [[Sexual intercourse|copulation]] scenes,<ref>Anne Gillain, \"Profile of a Filmmaker: Catherine Breillat\" ''Beyond French Feminisms: debates on women, Politics and Culture in France, 1981 \u2013 2001'', edited by Roger C\u00e9lestin et al. New York: Macmillan (2003): 202. Catherine Breillat's \"film ''Romance'' had received much praise\u2014and criticism\u2014the previous year for using a porn-film actor and a scene showing a nonsimulated sexual act, including a shot of an erection in the foreground.\"</ref> especially one showing Ducey's coitus with Siffredi. ''Romance'' is one of several arthouse films featuring explicit, [[unsimulated sex]], along with ''[[The Brown Bunny]]'' (2003), ''[[9 Songs]]'' (2004)<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.findmesimilar.com/2013/05/movies-like-9-songs.html|title=Movies Like 9 Songs (2004)|date=2 March 2020}}</ref> and ''[[All About Anna]]'' (2005).\n\n==Plot==\n\nA young woman named Marie (Ducey) lives with her boyfriend, Paul (St\u00e9venin), who refuses to have sex with her. She searches for intimacy beyond the bounds of traditional sexual limitations. She has a sexual relationship with Paolo (Siffredi), whom she meets in a bar. Her frustration also drives her to a series of relationships, until she engages in [[sadomasochism]] with an older man.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Caroline Ducey]] as Marie\n* [[Sagamore St\u00e9venin]] as Paul\n* [[Fran\u00e7ois Berl\u00e9and]] as Robert\n* [[Rocco Siffredi]] as Paolo\n* Ashley Wanninger as Ashley\n* Emma Colberti as Charlotte\n* Fabien de Jomaron as Claude\n\n==Production==\nIn an interview with The Post, [[Catherine Breillat]] appeared to confirm the rumors of actual on-set sex. \"An actor never pretends,\" she said. \"At the same time, I'm not perverse. I don't impose on my actors or actresses any more than is absolutely necessary. But I don't pretend. I don't simulate. The deal was, we'd go as far as we had to, as far as the film required.\"<ref>{{cite news |title=A real 'Romance'? : This French flick'S graphic sex scenes aren't just acting, director says  |work=nypost.com |date=18 September 1999 |url=https://nypost.com/1999/09/18/a-real-romance-this-french-flicks-graphic-sex-scenes-arent-just-acting-director-says/ |access-date=12 February 2022 }}</ref>\n\n==Broadcasting and ratings==\nIn Europe, ''Romance'' was shown in mainstream cinemas; in the United States, it was reduced to a mainstream-acceptable [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system|R rating]], and the European original version is un-rated.
