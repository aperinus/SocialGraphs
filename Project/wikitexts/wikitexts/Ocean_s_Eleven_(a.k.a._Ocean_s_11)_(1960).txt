It includes cameo appearances by [[Shirley MacLaine]], [[Red Skelton]] and [[George Raft]].\n\nThe film served as the primary inspiration for the [[Ocean's (franchise)|''Ocean's'' film series]] (2001\u20132007), a collection of heist films directed, shot, or produced by [[Steven Soderbergh]] and featuring [[List of Ocean's characters|an ensemble cast]]. The first film of the series, ''[[Ocean's Eleven]]'', features Dickinson and Silva in cameo roles.\n\n==Plot==\n[[World War II]] veterans [[List of Ocean's characters#Danny Ocean|Danny Ocean]] and Jimmy Foster recruit nine comrades from their unit in the [[82nd Airborne Division]] to simultaneously rob five [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]] [[casino]]s: the [[Sahara Las Vegas|Sahara]], the [[Riviera (hotel and casino)|Riviera]], the [[Desert Inn]], the [[Sands Hotel and Casino|Sands]], and the [[Flamingo Las Vegas|Flamingo]].\n\n[[File:Ocean's Eleven1960.jpg|thumb|From left to right: Lester, Bishop, Davis, Sinatra, and Martin|alt=]]\nThe gang plans the elaborate [[New Year's Eve]] heist with the precision of a military operation. Josh Howard takes a job as a sanitation worker driving a garbage truck while others get jobs at the various casinos. Sam Harmon entertains in one of the hotel's lounges. Demolition charges are planted on a local [[electric power transmission]] tower and the backup electrical systems are covertly rewired in each casino. At midnight on New Year's Eve, the tower is blown up and the [[Las Vegas Strip]] goes dark, as the men sneak into the money cages, hold up the cashiers, and dump their collection bags into the hotels' garbage bins. A garbage truck driven by Josh picks up the bags and passes through the police blockade. Everything appears to have gone off without a hitch.\n\nThe gang's electrician, Tony Bergdorf, drops dead of a [[Myocardial infarction|heart attack]] in the middle of the Strip. This raises police suspicions, who wonder if there is any connection to the thefts. Reformed mobster Duke Santos offers to recover the casino bosses' money for a percentage. As the robbery was well organized, he assumes that it was a [[American Mafia|Mafia]] operation until his underworld connections deny any involvement. Duke is engaged to Foster's mother, who casually mentions that Foster and Ocean, having fought together in the army, are both unexpectedly in Las Vegas. Duke also learns about Bergdorf's military record from the police. By the time that Bergdorf's body arrives at the mortuary, Duke has pieced it all together.\n\nDuke confronts the thieves, demanding half of their take. In desperation, they hide the money in Bergdorf's coffin, setting aside $10,000 for his widow. The group plans to take back the rest, making no payoff to Duke, after the coffin is shipped to [[San Francisco]]. Their plan backfires when the funeral director talks Bergdorf's widow into having the funeral in Las Vegas. She has the body and coffin [[cremation|cremated]] along with all of the hidden cash.\n\n==Cast==\n===Ocean's 11===\nThe film derives its name from this group of 11:\n*[[Frank Sinatra]] as Danny Ocean\n*[[Dean Martin]] as Sam Harmon\n*[[Sammy Davis Jr.]] as Josh Howard\n*[[Peter Lawford]] as Jimmy Foster\n*[[Richard Conte]] as Tony Bergdorf\n*[[Joey Bishop]] as \"Mushy\" O'Connors\n*[[Henry Silva]] as Roger Corneal\n*[[Buddy Lester]] as Vince Massler\n*[[Richard Benedict]] as George \"Curly\" Steffans\n*[[Norman Fell]] as Peter Rheimer\n*[[Clem Harvey]] as Louis Jackson\n\n===Others===\n*[[Angie Dickinson]] as Beatrice Ocean\n*[[Cesar Romero]] as Duke Santos\n*[[Patrice Wymore]] as Adele Elkstrom\n*[[Akim Tamiroff]] as Spyros Acebos\n*[[Ilka Chase]] as Mrs. Restes\n*[[Jean Willes]] as Gracie Bergdorf\n*[[Hank Henry]] as Mr. Kelly, the mortician\n*[[Lew Gallo]] as Jealous Young Man\n*[[Robert Foulk]] as Sheriff Wimmer\n\n===Cameos===\n*[[George Raft]] as Jack Strager (Casino Owner)<ref name=\"raft\">Everett Aaker, ''The Films of George Raft'', McFarland & Company, 2013 p 171</ref>\n*[[Red Skelton]] as Himself\n*[[Shirley MacLaine]] as Inebriated woman<ref name=AFICatalog>{{cite web |url=https://catalog.afi.com/Film/53237-OCEANS-ELEVEN?sid=35f3ccae-cd9c-422d-b0c8-f73e52ba046d&sr=0.06255604&cp=1&pos=8 |title=OCEAN'S ELEVEN (1960) |work=[[AFI Catalog of Feature Films]] |access-date=2021-05-07}}</ref> (Martin's kisser)\n*[[Red Norvo]] as Himself/Hotel [[Vibraphone|Vibraphonist]] (Martin's band when he sings \"[[Ain't That a Kick in the Head?]]\")<ref name=AFICatalog/>\n* Shiva as snake dancer\n\n==Production==\nPeter Lawford was first told of the film's basic premise by director Gilbert Kay, who had heard the idea from a [[filling station]] attendant. Lawford bought the rights in 1958, envisioning [[William Holden]] in the lead.<ref name=\"ratpack\">pp.117\u2013121 Levy, Shawn ''Rat Pack Confidential'' 1998 Fourth Estate Ltd</ref> Frank Sinatra became interested in the idea, and a variety of writers worked on the project.

One segment was also filmed at the former [[Las Vegas station (Nevada)|Las Vegas Union Pacific station]].\n\nTwo [[Beverly Hills, California|Beverly Hills]] locations were used: the opening barber shop scene was filmed at 9740 [[Wilshire Boulevard]] and the scenes at Spyros Acebos's house were filmed at 230 Ladera Drive, which belonged to Hollywood agent Kurt Frings.\n\n==Reception==\nThe film received mixed reviews from critics. [[Bosley Crowther]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' disliked the film because \"there is no built-in implication that the boys have done something wrong. There is just an ironic, unexpected and decidedly ghoulish twist whereby they are deprived of their pickings and what seems their just desserts. This is the flaw in the picture&nbsp;\u2014 this and the incidental fact that a wholesale holdup of Las Vegas would not be so easy as it is made to look\".<ref>{{cite journal |last=Crowther |first=Bosley |date=August 11, 1960 |title=The Screen: 'Ocean's 11' |journal=[[The New York Times]] |page=19 }}</ref>\n\n''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' wrote that the film was \"frequently one resonant wisecrack away from turning into a musical comedy. Laboring under the handicaps of a contrived script, an uncertain approach and personalities in essence playing themselves, the Lewis Milestone production never quite makes its point, but romps along merrily unconcerned that it doesn't\".<ref>{{cite journal |date=August 10, 1960 |title=Ocean's Eleven |journal=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |page=6 }}</ref> Leo Sullivan of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' called the film \"nothing more than a whopping sick joke in Technicolor ...
