Described as \"''[[Beverly Hills, 90210|Beverly Hills 90210]]'' on [[Lysergic acid diethylamide|acid]]\", the film follows a day in the lives of a group of Los Angeles college students and the strange lives that they lead. It stars an [[ensemble cast]] led by [[James Duval]] and [[Rachel True]].\n\nThe film is Araki's sixth overall and third entry in his ''Teenage Apocalypse'' film trilogy, preceded by ''[[Totally Fucked Up]]'' (1993) and ''[[The Doom Generation]]'' (1995). Like the other films in the trilogy, it contains scenes of graphic violence and sexuality. The film notably includes several cast members on the verge of stardom, including  [[Ryan Phillippe]], [[Mena Suvari]], [[Kathleen Robertson]], and [[Denise Richards]].\n\nInitial reception was mixed, though in subsequent years it has garnered a [[Cult following|cult status]] and its reputation among critics has grown.\n\n==Plot==\n{{Long plot|date=February 2022}}\nDark and Mel are a bisexual couple in an open relationship. Mel is dating a girl named Lucifer, who Dark hates, while Dark is interested in a mysterious boy he keeps running into named Montgomery. The three of them meet up at a caf\u00e9 they frequent, where we're introduced to other teens they know, such as Alyssa, Dingbat and Egg and Dark's friend Cowboy, and they discuss a party being held that night by a man they know named Jujyfruit.  Egg runs into an unnamed TV star from ''[[Baywatch]]'' (played by ''Baywatch'' actor [[Jaason Simmons]]).\n\nCowboy tells Dark about the heroin addiction his boyfriend Bart suffers with. He offers Bart the chance to fix their relationship if he stops using drugs, but he declines.  Alyssa and Dingbat meet with Ducky, Egg's brother and Dingbat's crush, before Alyssa meets up with her boyfriend Elvis. While waiting at a bus stop, Dark sees three valley girls killed by an alien, which he tries to catch on video before it disappears.\n\nAt the ''Baywatch'' star's place, he and Egg watch TV together before he tries to make a move on her. She rejects his advances, angering him and leading to him raping her.  Dark and his friends play a drugged out game of hide and seek, during which Montgomery gets abducted by the same alien from earlier, who Dark runs into in a locker room. Egg and Bart both return home and watch the same televangelist, Moses Helper, on TV, who encourages the two to commit suicide in order to reach heaven.\n\nWhen he fails to convince Mel to become monogamous at Jujyfruit's party, Dark goes outside and is joined by Dingbat. Suddenly Ducky, after hearing about his sister's suicide, leaps into a swimming pool, with Dingbat using CPR to resuscitate him. Going back into the party, Dark enters a kitchen where he sees the same alien from earlier. He meets with Handjob and begins to tell him about his day before Alyssa and Elvis arrive. Elvis claims Handjob sold him cut drugs and beats him to death with a can of tomato soup.\n\nDark returns home and records a diary entry on his video camera, saying how he's \"totally doomed\". As he attempts to sleep, Montgomery knocks on his window. Dark lets him in as he explains that he was abducted and experimented on by aliens who intend to invade Earth. The two lie down in bed together and Montgomery asks if he can spend the night, with Dark agreeing only if he promises to never leave. The two close their eyes but are disturbed, as Montgomery goes into a coughing fit, then explodes into a shower of blood, leaving only a cockroach-like alien who exclaims, \"I'm outta here,\" before crawling out of the window. A blood-covered Dark turns to the audience, staring with his mouth wide open.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast listing|\n* [[James Duval]] as \"Dark\"\n* [[Rachel True]] as Mel\n* Nathan Bexton as Montgomery\n* [[Chiara Mastroianni]] as Kriss\n* [[Debi Mazar]] as \"Kozy\"\n* [[Kathleen Robertson]] as \"Lucifer\"\n* Joshua Gibran Mayweather as \"Zero\"\n* [[Jordan Ladd]] as Alyssa\n* [[Christina Applegate]] as \"Dingbat\"\n* [[Sarah Lassez]] as \"Egg\"\n* [[Guillermo D\u00edaz (actor)|Guillermo Diaz]] as \"Cowboy\"\n* [[Jeremy Jordan (singer, born 1973)|Jeremy Jordan]] as Bart\n* Alan Boyce as \"Handjob\"\n* [[Jaason Simmons]] as The Teen Idol\n* [[Ryan Phillippe]] as Shad\n* [[Heather Graham]] as Lilith\n* [[Scott Caan]] as \"Ducky\"\n* Thyme Lewis as Elvis\n* [[Mena Suvari]] as Zoe\n* [[Beverly D'Angelo]] as Dark's Mom\n* [[Denise Richards]] as Jana\n* [[Teresa Hill]] as Shannon\n* [[Traci Lords]] as Val-Chick 1\n* [[Shannen Doherty]] as Val-Chick 2\n* [[Rose McGowan]] as Val-Chick 3\n* [[John Ritter]] as Moses Helper\n* [[Charlotte Rae]] as Fortune Teller\n* [[Christopher Knight (actor)|Christopher Knight]] as Mr. Sighvatssohn\n* [[Eve Plumb]] as Mrs. Sighvatssohn\n* [[Lauren Tewes]] as Julie, The Newscaster\n* [[David Leisure]] as Egg and Ducky's Dad\n* [[Devon Odessa]] as \"What\"\n* [[Staci Keanan]] as \"Ever\"\n* [[Gibby Haynes]] as \"Jujyfruit\"\n* [[Gregg Araki]] as Cockroach Alien (voice, uncredited)\n}}\n\n==Reception==\nThe film received mixed reviews from critics.
