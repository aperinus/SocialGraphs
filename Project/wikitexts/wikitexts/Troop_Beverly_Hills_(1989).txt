It is produced by the [[Weintraub Entertainment Group]] and directed by [[Jeff Kanew]], starring [[Shelley Long]], [[Craig T. Nelson]], [[Betty Thomas]], [[Mary Gross]], [[Stephanie Beacham]] and introducing [[Jenny Lewis]] as Hannah Nefler. The film features a host of young actors, including [[Carla Gugino]], [[Kellie Martin]], [[Emily Schulman]], [[Ami Foster]], and [[Tori Spelling]].<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nThe film follows Beverly Hills housewife Phyllis Nefler (Shelley Long) as she decides to become a leader of a local troop of Wilderness Girls to prove to her husband she can finish anything she sets her mind to. Phyllis becomes an unlikely den mother to the girls, who aren\u2019t taken seriously by other troops. When Phyllis falls afoul of a rival troop leader, the girls face the possibility of having their group dissolved\u2014unless they can prove their wilderness skills at the annual jamboree.\n\nThough the film was not a financial success during its release, it has since acquired a cult following as a [[1980s in film|1980s]] [[Children's film|kids\u2019 movie]] with a [[Feminism|feminist]] message.<ref name=\":0\" /> In 2020, a [[sequel]] was announced to be in development.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Donnelly |first=Matt |date=4 September 2020 |title=\u2018Troop Beverly Hills\u2019 Sequel in the Works From Director Oran Zegman |url=https://variety.com/2020/film/news/troop-beverly-hills-sequel-1234759870/ |access-date=24 March 2022 |website=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nPhyllis Nefler is a [[socialite]] wife recently [[legal separation|separated]] from her husband Freddy, a wealthy owner of an auto shop chain. In an attempt to maintain the relationship with her daughter Hannah during the contentious divorce, Phyllis becomes the den mother of Hannah's unruly, leaderless local [[Girl Scouts of the USA|girl scout]] troop of Wilderness Girls.\n\nTheir first campout results in the troop getting caught in a rain squall, prompting Phyllis to take the girls to 'camp out' at the [[Beverly Hills Hotel]]. Despite her lack of wilderness skills, Phyllis demonstrates an unwavering commitment to the girls' well-being and becomes a surrogate mother to the troop. She resolves to teach the girls how to survive in \"the wilds of Beverly Hills\", even customizing new [[Scout badge|merit badges]] for her troop.\n\nPhyllis' unorthodox methods run afoul of another scout leader, Velda Plendor, a mean-spirited, retired army nurse who runs the Culver City \"Red Feathers\", of which her own daughter Cleo is a member of. Because Velda has considerable influence at the regional council level, she declares Phyllis' customized merit badges ineligible. Velda sends her assistant troop leader Annie Herman to infiltrate Troop Beverly Hills and sabotage them. Velda and Annie\u2019s attempts at sabotage prove unsuccessful, as Velda\u2019s boss and regional council leader Frances Temple states that while Phyllis may have unusual methods, she has taken an active interest in these girls and is trying to help them learn to survive their personal environment.\n\nTroop Beverly Hills can gain recognition from the regional council by passing a series of tests at an upcoming [[Jamboree (Scouting)|Jamboree]]. In order to qualify, the troop needs to sell 1,000 boxes of [[Girl Scout Cookies|cookies]]. To prevent this, Velda one-ups Troop Beverly Hills by selling cookies in their own neighborhood. Annie breaks ties with Velda and sides with Phyllis. The Troop ends up selling over 4,000 boxes of cookies, more than enough to qualify for the Jamboree. At a party for the Troop, Velda takes her anger out on Annie, who snaps back, standing up to her superior for the first time.\n\nMeanwhile, Phyllis reconnects with Freddy, who tells her he is proud she has accomplished something. However, Phyllis soon learns that Freddy still wants to proceed with the divorce, including seeking [[joint custody]] of Hannah, which devastates Phyllis. She decides to disband the troop, but Hannah and the other girls change her mind, telling Phyllis she has given them a new sense of self-esteem.\n\nDuring the Jamboree, the Red Feathers trick Troop Beverly Hills during the competition by misdirecting them into a snake-infested swamp. Luckily, a skunk scares them into running through a shortcut, making them first in the qualifying event. The next day, Velda cheats again by cutting a rope bridge after her troop crosses and by leading them into a restricted area used only for hunting. However, Velda falls and breaks her ankle. The Red Feathers, now led by Cleo, abandon Velda for the sake of winning. Troop Beverly Hills repairs the bridge and finds Velda. Tessa diagnoses her broken ankle (and a severe personality disorder). The girls reluctantly carry her to the finish line after Phyllis reminds them that they have to be considerate to those in need \u2014 especially a fellow Wilderness Girl.\n\nThough the Red Feathers cross the finish line first, they are disqualified because council law stipulates the leader must be with the troop. Troop Beverly Hills is declared the winners of the Jamboree and are recognized as Wilderness Girls. Frances fires Velda for cheating and for placing the Troop Beverly Hills girls in jeopardy. Freddy, intrigued by Phyllis's complete turnaround, shows interest in calling off the divorce and they reconcile.\n\nThe next year, Troop Beverly Hills is the designated Poster Troop. Velda is forced to take a job at [[Kmart (United States)|Kmart]] after her actions made her virtually unemployable, and a final scene shows her making a store-wide announcement about cookies.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Shelley Long]] as Phyllis Nefler, a [[Beverly Hills]] socialite and the new leader of Wilderness Girls Troop Beverly Hills\n* [[Craig T.
