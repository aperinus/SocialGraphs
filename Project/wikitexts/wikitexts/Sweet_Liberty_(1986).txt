During a visit to see his dying father, a nurse approached him with a [[head shot]] and [[r\u00e9sum\u00e9]]. In an interview prior to the film's UK release he said, \"It was the worst year of my life and I thought this is so miserable there must be a funny movie in it!\".<ref>{{cite web |title=Humouring Illusions |url=https://archive.list.co.uk/the-list/1986-09-19/8/ |publisher=The List |access-date=2019-06-24 |date=1986-09-19}}</ref>\n\nIt was Gish's penultimate film role; her first appearance on screen came in 1912.\n\n==Plot==\nCollege history professor Michael Burgess ([[Alan Alda]]) is about to have his fact-based [[historical novel]] about the [[American Revolution]] turned into a [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] [[motion picture]]. Set to star the egotistical [[Lothario]] Elliott James ([[Michael Caine]]) (who is portraying [[Banastre Tarleton]] in the film) and the seemingly sweet [[Method acting|Method actress]] Faith Healy ([[Michelle Pfeiffer]]), the production will be filmed in the fictional small college town of Sayeville, North Carolina where Burgess teaches.\n\nMichael's excitement is squelched by his increasing exasperation as the novel is changed by a low-brow scriptwriter ([[Bob Hoskins]]) and a condescending director ([[Saul Rubinek]]) into a steamy tale of lust and betrayal, complete with nudity and distortions of historical fact.\n\nWhile Michael navigates on-set politics, he is distracted by his mother Cecilia ([[Lillian Gish]]) and her delusions, including the belief that she is being poisoned and that the Devil lives in her kitchen. He has been trying unsuccessfully to convince his girlfriend Gretchen ([[Lise Hilboldt]]) to move in with him. He falls for Faith and begins an affair with her, believing her to be like the character she is portraying in the film.\n\nWhen Gretchen finds out, she begins welcoming the advances of Elliott James. The married actor is not only flirting with Gretchen but also pursuing the Mayor's wife ([[Lois Chiles]]). He humiliates Michael repeatedly in bouts of [[fencing]]. Elliott's wife ([[Linda Thorson]]) arrives on the set, complicating matters further.\n\nMichael becomes disillusioned when he realizes that Faith is not at all like her film character, and he is disgusted by the Hollywood process. When [[Extra (acting)|extra]]s from a local Revolutionary War reenactor company are bullied and mocked by the film crew, Michael persuades them to turn the tables on their tormentors. He deliberately sabotages the historically inaccurate film by injecting a little accuracy and a lot of chaos.\n\nThe locals use explosives during a horribly inaccurate recreation of the [[Battle of Cowpens]] and destroy a prop building before the director is ready with the shot. Michael, who had previously been lectured by the arrogant director that audiences want defiance of authority, destruction of property and nudity, reveals how he has undermined the production. He tells the extras to celebrate the battle by dancing naked before the camera.\n\nBy the time of the film's [[premiere]] in town, the Hollywood people are long gone and Michael and Gretchen are back together. They arrive to the screening with Gretchen very much pregnant. Michael can only respond with a strained look when he is asked by a Hollywood reporter how it feels \"to see history come alive\".\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Alan Alda]] as Michael Burgess\n* [[Michael Caine]] as Elliott James\n* [[Michelle Pfeiffer]] as Faith Healy\n* [[Bob Hoskins]] as Stanley Gould\n* [[Lise Hilboldt]] as Gretchen Carlsen\n* [[Lillian Gish]] as Cecelia Burgess\n* [[Saul Rubinek]] as Bo Hodges\n* [[Lois Chiles]] as Leslie\n* [[Linda Thorson]] as Grace James\n\n==Reception==\n\n=== Box Office ===\nReleased May 16, 1986, ''Sweet Liberty'' was the 3rd highest grossing movie of its debut week, behind [[Top Gun]], also released that week, and [[Short Circuit (1986 film)|Short Circuit]].

[[Vincent Canby]] in the ''[[New York Times]]'' called it a \"mildly satiric comedy so toothless it wouldn't even offend a mogul as sensitive and publicly pious as [[Louis B.
