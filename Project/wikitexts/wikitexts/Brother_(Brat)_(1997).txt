The film stars [[Sergei Bodrov Jr.]] as Danila Bagrov, a young ex-conscript who becomes embroiled with the [[Saint Petersburg]] mob through his criminal older brother. It appeared in the [[Un Certain Regard]] section at the [[1997 Cannes Film Festival]].<ref name=\"festival-cannes.com\">{{cite web |url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/4848/year/1997.html |title=Festival de Cannes: Traveling Companion |access-date=2009-09-26|work=festival-cannes.com}}</ref> \n\nAfter its release on VHS in June 1997, ''Brother'' unexpectedly became one of the most commercially successful [[Cinema of Russia|Russian films]] of the 1990s and quickly rose to [[cult film]] status throughout Russia. Due to the film's popularity and fan demand, a sequel, ''[[Brother 2]]'', was released in 2000.\n\n==Plot==\n{{Long plot|date=March 2022}}\nAfter Danila Bagrov ([[Sergei Bodrov Jr.]]), a recently discharged [[First Chechen War|Chechen War]] veteran, gets into a fight with security guards, his mother insists he travels to [[Saint Petersburg]] to seek out his successful older brother Viktor, whom his mother is confident will help him make a living. He does, and there he befriends Kat, an energetic drug addict, and \"The German\" Hoffman, a homeless street vendor whom Danila helps after a thug attempts to extort him.\n\nUnbeknown to their mother, Viktor is an accomplished hitman who goes by the street name \"The Tatar\" but is growing too independent and is starting to irritate his mob boss, Roundhead. His latest target is \"The Chechen\", a [[Chechen mafia]] boss who was recently released from prison and now runs a market. Roundhead, who is unhappy with the amount of money that Viktor demanded for the hit, orders his thugs to watch him in secret.\n\nDanila eventually meets up with Viktor. To avoid exposure, Viktor passes his assignment to his brother, gives him money to settle into the city, and then lies to him that the Chechen has been extorting from him, asking Danila to perform the hit, which he does. Roundhead's thugs spot and chase him, but he manages to escape by jumping into a freight tram, driven by a woman named Sveta.\n\nAfter Danila recovers, he decides to meet up with her, despite her being married to an abusive husband. With the money given to him by Viktor after the hit, he begins to enjoy Saint Petersburg, gives his provincial image a makeover and takes Sveta out to a concert of his favorite band [[Nautilus Pompilius (band)|Nautilus Pompilius]]. At the same time he also meets up with Kat to go to a nightclub, smokes cannabis in an afterparty and sleeps with her afterwards.\n\nMeanwhile, Roundhead is angry about losing one of his men and the fact that Viktor used someone else to carry out the hit, and decides to draw him into a combined raid. Viktor, again suspecting a trap, passes the job to Danila once more. The two thugs raid the apartment, but their main target is away. While they wait, in an apartment on the floor above, a party is taking place. A young radio director, Stepan, mistakes the raided flat for the party flat and is almost killed by the thugs, who take him captive. Bored of the waiting, Danila decides to go to the party above and relaxes in the friendly musical atmosphere. Some time afterward, he comes back to find the thugs killed their primary target, and are about to do the same with Stepan, but Danila kills them and, with Stepan's help, drags the bodies to the [[Smolensky Lutheran Cemetery]], where Hoffman helps dispose of them.\n\nRoundhead, furious finding out what happened, decides to track Danila and intercepts Sveta's tram. They later raid her apartment, where his men beat and rape her, and learn his phone number, as well as his address. A henchman nicknamed \"Mole\" ambushes Danila near his apartment building, but Danila manages to kill him. Realizing that staying home is unsafe, he travels to Sveta's house and is shocked at her state. He learns that Roundhead was responsible and realizes that the only way they could have tracked her was when he returned a phone call from her home telephone to his brother.\n\nAt the same time, Roundhead raids Viktor's apartment and forces him to call Danila at gunpoint, urging him to come over. Realizing the depth of the situation, Danila goes back to the communal room that he was renting, and buys a shotgun from his landlord. At Viktor's apartment, he takes out Roundhead and two of his henchmen and tells the surviving thug to warn the rest of the gang that he will kill anyone who hurts his brother.\n\nDanila forgives Viktor and gives him some of the money from Roundhead's suitcase, telling him to return home and to work for the [[militsiya]]. Before leaving for Moscow, he visits Sveta, and upon finding her husband beating her, he shoots him in his leg before leaving. He then says goodbye to Hoffman and Kat, before hitching a ride to [[Moscow]] on a passing truck.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Sergei Bodrov Jr.]] \u2013 Danila Bagrov\n* [[Viktor Sukhorukov]] \u2013 Viktor Bagrov (voiced by [[Aleksei Poluyan]])\n* Svetlana Pismichenko \u2013 Sveta\n* Maria Zhukova \u2013 Kat\n* [[Yury Kuznetsov (actor)|Yury Kuznetsov]] \u2013 \"The German\" Hoffman\n* Irina Rakshina \u2013 Zinka\n* Sergei Murzin \u2013 Roundhead (voiced by Aleksandr Stroev)\n* Andrey Fyodortsov \u2013 Stepan\n* Igor Shibanov \u2013 Militiaman\n*[[Andrey Krasko]] \u2013 Owner of the raided apartment\n*[[Aleksei Poluyan]] \u2013 \"Mole\" the bandit\n*[[Igor Lifanov]] \u2013 One of Roundhead's bandits (voiced by [[Aleksandr Bashirov]])\n*Tatiana Zakharova \u2013 Danila's and Viktor's mother (voiced by [[Nina Usatova]])\n*Sergei Debizhev \u2013 Music video director (voiced by [[Valery Kukhareshin]])\n*Konstantin Anisimov \u2013 Music video security guard (voiced by [[Viktor Bychkov (actor)|Viktor Bychkov]])\n*Anatoly Gorin \u2013 Sveta's roommate (voiced by Viktor Bychkov)\n\nThe film also features brief appearances from several Russian rock musicians:\n* [[Vyacheslav Butusov]], as well as other members of [[Nautilus Pompilius (band)|Nautilus Pompilius]]\n* [[Sergey Chigrakov]]\n* Nastya Poleva\n* Band members of [[Aquarium (band)|Aquarium]]\n* Band members of [[Kolibri (band)|Kolibri]]\n\n==Production crew==\n* [[Aleksei Balabanov]] \u2013 director, screenwriter\n* Sergei Astakhov \u2013 camera operator\n* [[Vladimir Kartashov]] \u2013 production designer\n* Nadezhda Vasilyeva \u2013 costumer\n* [[Vyacheslav Butusov]] \u2013 composer\n* Sergei Selyanov \u2013 producer\n\n==Release==\n''Brother'' was selected for screening at a number of Russian and international film festivals, where it won many awards.

The story's depiction revolves around the problems and attitudes of the 1990s Russia: crime, poverty (in face of the homeless Hoffman), the disaffection of the Russian youth (as with the character Kat), failing families (as with Sveta and her abusive husband) and of course, betrayal and hypocrisy even towards the most closest of relatives (such as Viktor first using Danila as cover, and then turning him over). All this was brought about in the aftermath of the Soviet collapse, which took place only six years prior. Yet, despite such negative connotation amid the social decay, it illustrates that there is still courage and good in the face of Danila, who is portrayed as having an acute sense of right and wrong, and appears to follow some semblance of a [[Morality|moral code]]. As such it carries a powerful psychological message to the Russian audience that even in such gloomy times there is still hope. \n\n===Critical response===\n''Brother'' has an approval rating of [[List of films with a 100% rating on Rotten Tomatoes|100%]] on [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], based on 5 reviews, and an average rating of 7.63/10.<ref>{{Citation|title=Brother (1997)|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/brother_1997|language=en|access-date=2021-01-08}}</ref>\n\n===Awards===\n\n\n== Sequel ==\nFollowing the film's success, Balabanov initially planned on making a ''Brother'' trilogy: the second instalment was to take place in Moscow and the third in [[United States|America]].
