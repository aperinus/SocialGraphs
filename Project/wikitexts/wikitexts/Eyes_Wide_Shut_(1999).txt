See also WP policy [[WP:UNDUE]]--> directed, produced, and co-written by [[Stanley Kubrick]]. It is based on the 1926 [[novella]] ''[[Dream Story|Traumnovelle]]'' (''Dream Story'') by [[Arthur Schnitzler]], transferring the story's setting from early twentieth-century Vienna to 1990s New York City. The plot centers on a doctor ([[Tom Cruise]]) who is shocked when his wife ([[Nicole Kidman]]) reveals that she had contemplated having an affair a year earlier. He then embarks on a night-long adventure, during which he infiltrates a masked orgy of an unnamed secret society.\n\nKubrick obtained the filming rights for ''Dream Story'' in the 1960s, considering it a perfect text for a film adaptation about sexual relations. He revived the project in the 1990s when he hired writer [[Frederic Raphael]] to help him with the adaptation. The film, which was mostly shot in England, apart from some exterior [[establishing shots]], includes a detailed recreation of exterior [[Greenwich Village]] street scenes made at [[Pinewood Studios]]. The film's production, at 400 days, holds the [[Guinness World Record]] for the longest continuous film shoot.\n\nKubrick died six days after showing the final cut of ''Eyes Wide Shut'' to [[Warner Bros.]], making it the final film he directed. He reportedly considered it his \"greatest contribution to the art of cinema\". In order to ensure a theatrical [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system#Ratings|R rating]] in the United States, Warner Bros. digitally altered several sexually explicit scenes during post-production. This version was released on July 16, 1999, to moderately positive reactions from film critics. Box office receipts for the film worldwide were about $162 million, making it Kubrick's highest-grossing film. The uncut version has since been released in [[DVD]], [[HD DVD]] and [[Blu-ray Disc]] formats. ''Eyes Wide Shut'' has been included in several lists of the greatest films of the 1990s.\n\n==Plot==\nDr. William \"Bill\" Harford and his wife Alice live in New York City with their daughter Helena. They attend a Christmas party hosted by wealthy patient Victor Ziegler, where Bill is reunited with Nick Nightingale, an old medical school classmate who dropped out and now plays the piano professionally. An older Hungarian guest attempts to seduce Alice, and two young models attempt to seduce Bill. He is interrupted by his host, who had been having sex with Mandy, a young woman who has overdosed on a [[Speedball (drug)|speedball]]. Mandy recovers with Bill's aid.\n\nThe following evening, while smoking marijuana, Alice and Bill discuss their episodes of unfulfilled temptation. Bill tells Alice he is not jealous of other men's attraction to her because he deems women naturally inclined to fidelity. She then discloses that during their vacation on [[Cape Cod]], she encountered a [[naval officer]] and fantasized about him enough that she considered leaving Bill and their daughter. Bill is disturbed by Alice's revelation before being called to the house of a patient who has just died. The patient's distraught daughter, Marion, unsuccessfully tries to seduce Bill.\n\nUpon leaving, he engages with a sex worker named Domino. Alice phones when they start kissing, prompting Bill to have a change of heart. He pays Domino for the sexless encounter and meets Nick at a jazz club. Nick describes an impending engagement where he must play piano blindfolded in events featuring beautiful women. It all takes place in a mysterious mansion in Shoreside Vale, in locality Cedar Grove, outside of New York. Invitees require a costume, a mask and a password. Bill goes to a costume shop and offers the owner, Milich, a generous amount of money to rent a costume. Inside the shop, Milich is outraged when he catches his young daughter with two men.\n\nBill takes a taxi to the country mansion mentioned by Nick. He gives the password and discovers a sexual ritual is taking place. One of the masked women warns him he is in terrible danger. Bill is ushered to a crowded room and unmasked by the master of ceremonies. The woman who had tried to warn Bill intervenes and insists on redeeming him, at an undisclosed personal cost. Bill is let off with a warning not to tell anyone about what happened.\n\nBill arrives home guilty and confused. He finds Alice laughing in her sleep and awakens her. She tearfully explains a dream in which she was having sex with the naval officer and many other men, and laughing at the idea of Bill witnessing the scene. The next morning, Bill goes to Nick's hotel. The desk clerk explains that a bruised and frightened Nick checked out hours earlier escorted by two dangerous-looking men. Bill returns the costume but seems to have misplaced the mask, and learns that Milich has sold his teenage daughter into sex slavery.\n\nThat afternoon, plagued by thoughts of his wife sleeping with the naval officer, Bill leaves his practice early to return to the site of the orgy. As he stands at the front gate, a man comes down to greet him and hands him an envelope addressed to him by name. Inside is an anonymous letter issuing him a second warning to stay away.\n\nBill calls Marion, but when her fianc\u00e9 answers he hangs up. Bill heads to Domino's apartment, apparently having decided to consummate his affair. However, he is greeted by a woman who claims that she is Domino's roommate, Sally. There is obvious sexual tension between Bill and Sally but she then reveals that Domino had received just that morning the results of a test that indicated that she was [[HIV]]-positive. Bill leaves.\n\nHaving left the apartment, Bill notices he is being followed by a mysterious figure. He sees the news about an ex-beauty queen's death from an overdose, goes to the morgue, and identifies her as Mandy. He is then summoned by Ziegler, who reveals he was a guest in the orgy and identified Bill through his connection with Nick. Ziegler claims the secret society's warnings are only intended to scare Bill from speaking about the orgy. However, he implies that the society is capable of acting on its threats. Bill asks about Nick's disappearance and Mandy's death, correctly identifying her as the masked orgy participant who sacrificed herself for him. Ziegler insists that Nick is safely back home in Seattle, and the punishment was part of the same charade of intimidation and had nothing to do with Mandy's death. He also says that Mandy was an addict who had died from another accidental drug overdose. Bill does not know whether Ziegler is telling the truth about Nick's whereabouts or Mandy's death.\n\nReturning home, Bill finds the rented mask on his pillow next to his sleeping wife. He breaks down in tears and tells Alice the whole truth of the past two days. The next morning, they go Christmas shopping with their daughter. Bill apologizes to Alice, and Alice muses that they should be grateful that their marriage and mutual love survived. She suggests that there is something they need to do \"as soon as possible\". When Bill asks what, she simply responds, \"[[Fuck]].\"\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast list|\n* [[Tom Cruise]] as Dr. William \"Bill\" Harford\n* [[Nicole Kidman]] as Alice Harford\n* [[Sydney Pollack]] as Victor Ziegler\n* [[Todd Field]] as Nick Nightingale\n* [[Marie Richardson]] as Marion Nathanson\n* [[Sky du Mont]] as Sandor Szavost\n* [[Rade \u0160erbed\u017eija]] as Mr. Milich\n* [[Thomas Gibson]] as Carl\n* [[Vinessa Shaw]] as Domino\n* [[Fay Masterson]] as Sally\n* [[Alan Cumming]] as Hotel Desk Clerk\n* [[Leelee Sobieski]] as Milich's daughter\n* [[Leon Vitali]] as gangster Hugo, dressed in a Red Cloak\n* [[Julienne Davis]] as Amanda \"Mandy\" Curran\n* Madison Eginton as Helena Harford\n* [[Abigail Good]] as Mysterious Woman\n* Gary Goba as Naval Officer\n}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\n''Eyes Wide Shut'' developed after Stanley Kubrick read Arthur Schnitzler's ''Dream Story'' in 1968, when Kubrick was looking for a project to follow ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]''.

The main characters are a couple named Fridolin and Albertina. The couple's home is a typical suburban middle-class home. Like the protagonist of the novel, Schnitzler was Jewish, lived in Vienna, and was a doctor, although he left medicine to write.\n\nKubrick frequently removed references to the Jewishness of characters in the novels he adapted.<ref name=\"cocks29\">{{harvnb|Cocks|2004|p=29}}</ref> In ''Eyes Wide Shut'', Frederic Raphael, who is Jewish, wanted to keep the Jewish background of the protagonists, but Kubrick disagreed and removed details that would identify characters as Jewish. Kubrick determined Bill should be a \"[[Harrison Ford]]-ish [[goy]]\" and created the surname of Harford as an allusion to the actor.{{sfn|Raphael|2000|p=59}} In the film, Bill is taunted with homophobic slurs. In the novella, the taunters are members of an [[anti-Semitic]] college fraternity.<ref name=\"cocks29\" /><ref>Lowenberg, Peter. \"Freud, Schnitzler, and Eyes Wide Shut,\" in ''[[#Depth|Depth of field: Stanley Kubrick, film, and the uses of history]]'' (2006), pp.&nbsp;255\u2013279.</ref> In an introduction to a Penguin Classics edition of ''Dream Story'', Raphael wrote that \"Fridolin is not declared to be a Jew, but his feelings of cowardice, for failing to challenge his aggressor, echo the uneasiness of Austrian Jews in the face of Gentile provocation.\"<ref>{{cite book |title=Dream Story |last=Schnitzler |first=Arthur |author2=Fredric Raphael |year=1999 |publisher=Penguin |isbn=978-0-14-118224-7 |page=xiii }}</ref>\n\nThe novella is set during the [[Carnival in Germany, Switzerland and Austria|Carnival]], when people often wear masks to parties. The party that both husband and wife attend at the opening of the story is a Carnival [[Masquerade ball]], whereas the film's story begins at Christmas time.<ref name=rs/>\n\nIn the novella, the party (which is sparsely attended) uses \"Denmark\" as the password for entrance; that is significant in that Albertina had her infatuation with her soldier in Denmark; the film's password is \"Fidelio\". In early drafts of the screenplay, the password was \"Fidelio Rainbow\". Jonathan Rosenbaum noted that both passwords echo elements of one member of the couple's behaviour, though in opposite ways.<ref>Rosenbaum, Jonathan. \"In Dreams Begin Responsibilities\"; in ''[[#Depth|Depth of field: Stanley Kubrick, film, and the uses of history]]'' (2006), pp.&nbsp;245\u2013254</ref> The party in the novella consists mostly of nude ballroom dancing.\n\nIn the novella, the woman who \"redeems\" Fridolin at the party, saving him from punishment, is costumed as a nun, and most of the characters at the party are dressed as nuns or monks; Fridolin himself used a monk costume. This aspect was retained in the film's original screenplay,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.godamongdirectors.com/scripts/eyeswshu.htm |title=Eyes Wide Shut original screenplay |publisher=Godamongdirectors.com |access-date=August 22, 2014 |archive-date=January 7, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140107074154/http://www.godamongdirectors.com/scripts/eyeswshu.htm |url-status=live }}</ref> but was deleted in the filmed version.\n\nThe novella makes it clear that Fridolin at this point hates Albertina more than ever, thinking they are now lying together \"like mortal enemies\". It has been argued{{who|date=December 2019}} that the dramatic climax of the novella is actually Albertina's dream, and the film has shifted the focus to Bill's visit to the secret society's orgy, whose content is more shocking in the film.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.clas.ufl.edu/ipsa/2003/Greenwich%20conference.html |title=Rainer J.

Whether this is to be believed or not, it is an exposition of Ziegler's view of the ways of the world as a member of the power elite.{{sfn|Cocks|2004 |p= 146}}\n\n===Casting===\nWhen Warner Bros. president [[Terry Semel]] approved production, he asked Kubrick to cast a movie star as \"you haven't done that since [[Jack Nicholson]] [in ''[[The Shining (film)|The Shining]]'']\".<ref name=\"time\" /> Kubrick considered casting both [[Alec Baldwin]] and [[Kim Basinger]] as Bill Harford and Alice Harford.<ref>{{Cite book|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=1SqXAAAAQBAJ&q=%22EYES+WIDE+SHUT%22+and+%22alec+baldwin%22&pg=PA82|title = Casting Might-Have-Beens: A Film by Film Directory of Actors Considered for Roles Given to Others|isbn = 9781476609768|last1 = Mell|first1 = Eila|date = 24 January 2015|access-date = June 25, 2021|archive-date = June 25, 2021|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20210625045908/https://books.google.com/books?id=1SqXAAAAQBAJ&q=%22EYES+WIDE+SHUT%22+and+%22alec+baldwin%22&pg=PA82|url-status = live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url = https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/60365/20-eye-opening-facts-about-eyes-wide-shut|title = 20 Eye-Opening Facts About Eyes Wide Shut|date = 16 July 2019|access-date = June 23, 2021|archive-date = June 24, 2021|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20210624210903/https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/60365/20-eye-opening-facts-about-eyes-wide-shut|url-status = live}}</ref> Cruise was in England as his wife [[Nicole Kidman]] was there filming ''[[The Portrait of a Lady (film)|The Portrait of a Lady]]'' (1996), and the pair eventually decided to visit Kubrick's estate.<ref>{{cite web|access-date=September 3, 2019|title=Eyes Wide Shut: 20 years on, Stanley Kubrick's most notorious film is still shrouded in mystery|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/features/eyes-wide-shut-stanley-kubrick-tom-cruise-nicole-kidman-marriage-film-plot-a9083926.html|date=September 1, 2019|website=The Independent|archive-date=March 4, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200304035044/https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/features/eyes-wide-shut-stanley-kubrick-tom-cruise-nicole-kidman-marriage-film-plot-a9083926.html|url-status=live}}</ref> After that meeting, the director awarded them the roles.<ref>{{cite video|title=Interview: Tom Cruise on Stanley Kubrick|work=Eyes Wide Shut Blu-Ray (2007)|date=1999|publisher=Warner Bros Home Entertainment}}</ref> Kubrick also managed to make both not commit to other projects until ''Eyes Wide Shut'' was completed.<ref name=closing/> [[Jennifer Jason Leigh]] and [[Harvey Keitel]] each were cast and filmed by Kubrick.

Some{{Who|date=August 2021}} have argued that the work which remained was minor and exclusively technical in nature, allowing the estate to faithfully complete the film based on the director's notes. However, decisions regarding sound mixing, scoring and color-correction would have necessarily been made without Kubrick's input. Furthermore, Kubrick had a history of continuing to edit his films up until the last minute, and in some cases even after initial public screenings, as had been the case with ''2001: A Space Odyssey'' and ''The Shining''.<ref>{{cite web|last=Allman|first=Marshall|title=Kubrick's Final Film Reimagined|url=https://www.eyeswidecut.com/inspiration/|access-date=August 24, 2018|archive-date=August 25, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180825041252/https://www.eyeswidecut.com/inspiration/|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nWriting for ''Vanity Fair'', Kubrick collaborator [[Michael Herr]] recalled a phone call from the director regarding the cut that would be screened for the Warner Bros. executives four days before his death:\n\n{{blockquote|text=... there was looping to be done and the music wasn't finished, lots of small technical fixes on color and sound; would I show work that wasn't finished?

But the truth is that&nbsp; ... let's put it this way, you've never seen two actors more completely subservient and prostrate themselves at the feet of a director.

It was one of the happiest weekends of his life, right before he died, after he had shown the first cut to Terry, Tom and Nicole. He would have kept working on it, like he did on all of his films.
