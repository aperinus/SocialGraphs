Her husband, Clay, is [[Residency (medicine)|training to be a doctor]] and is heavily in debt to a [[loan shark]]. He arranges to sell stolen pharmaceutical [[cocaine]] to two [[drug dealer]]s. The transaction becomes tense when the buyers pull a gun, but to Clay's surprise, they eventually pay him $700,000. Clay is left shaken, and on his return home he slaps Bridget after she insults him. She then flees their apartment with the cash while he is in the shower.\n\nOn her way to [[Chicago]], she stops in Beston, a small town near [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]]. There she meets Mike Swale, a local man back from a whirlwind marriage in Buffalo that he refuses to talk about. He tries to pick Bridget up, and she proceeds to use him for mere sexual gratification during her stay in town. Adept at word games and [[mirror writing]], and with an imminent return to her hometown in mind, Bridget changes her name to Wendy Kroy (as a reversal of 'New York') and gets a job at the insurance company where, coincidentally, Mike works. Their relationship is strained by her manipulative behavior and the fact he is falling for her.\n\nWhen Mike tells her how to find out if a man is cheating on his wife by reading his [[credit report]]s, Bridget invents a plan based on selling murders to cheated wives. She suggests they start with Lance Collier, a cheating, wife-beating husband residing in [[Florida]]. This proves to be the last straw for Mike, and he leaves her alone in his place after an argument. Meanwhile, Clay's thumb is broken by the loan shark for not repaying his loan. Fearing for his health and in dire financial straits, he hires a [[private detective]], Harlan, to retrieve the money from his wife.\n\nHarlan traces her phone area code, travels to Beston, and accosts Bridget at gunpoint right after her argument with Mike. Bridget purposely crashes her car after tricking Harlan into removing his seat belt, resulting in his death. Because Harlan was black, she uses local [[racial prejudice]] to persuade the police to close the case without further investigation. Bridget then resumes her manipulation of Mike and pretends to travel to Florida to kill Lance Collier. Instead, she goes to Buffalo to meet Mike's ex-wife, Trish. Upon returning, Bridget shows Mike the money she stole from Clay, claiming it is her cut of the life insurance payout from the new widow.\n\nBridget claims to have done it so they can live together, then tries to persuade him that he must also commit a similar murder so they will be even and to prove that he loves her. She tries to talk Mike into killing a [[tax lawyer]] in [[New York City]] who is cheating old ladies out of their homes. At first he refuses, but later agrees after receiving a letter from Trish saying she is moving to Beston. The letter was forged by Bridget to change his mind.\n\nMike goes to New York and breaks into the apartment of the supposed attorney, who turns out to be Clay. After Mike hand cuffs Clay, Clay realizes what is happening when Mike mentions Bridget's alias, and convinces Mike of the truth by showing him a photo of himself and Bridget together. They then hatch a plot to double-cross her, unaware that the tables will be turned on them. Bridget arrives and the still-immobilized Clay, who has been clever enough to predict most of Bridget's actions but fails to understand her [[sociopathy]], tries to make amends with her. Instead, she empties a [[pepper spray]] bottle down his throat, killing him. She tells a stunned Mike to [[rape]] her. When he refuses, she tells him she knows the truth about Trish, who is [[transgender]], and goads him by calling him a [[homophobic]] slur. This causes Mike to have rough sex with her while acting out a [[rape fantasy]]. Unbeknownst to Mike, Bridget has dialed [[9-1-1]] and she coaxes him into \"confessing\" to Clay's murder as part of the role play. Mike is arrested for rape and murder, while she escapes with the cash, later calmly destroying the only evidence that could have been used in Mike's defense.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Linda Fiorentino]] as Bridget Gregory\n* [[Peter Berg]] as Mike Swale\n* [[Bill Pullman]] as Clay Gregory\n* [[Bill Nunn]] as Harlan\n* [[J.

And I walked in the meeting with John Dahl, the director, and I said, 'John, you are not allowed to hire anyone but me for this film.'

Barancik recalled, \"Apparently, a guy from the company who was monitoring things and watching the dailies, saw the suspenders over Linda's nipples, and shouted out, 'Are we making an [[Art film|art movie]]?!' He shut down production and called the principals of the movie on the carpet and they all had to pledge that they had no artistic pretensions\".<ref name=CS/> The scene was cut and the sexual roleplaying theme was lost.<ref name=CS/>\n\nPeter Berg said it was a Linda Fiorentino's idea to shoot the chain-link-fence sex scene in that way. \"She said, 'John, get a camera,' and she climbed up on me against that fence and told John Dahl to shoot it, and that was the scene. She thought of it, she conceived it, she executed it.
