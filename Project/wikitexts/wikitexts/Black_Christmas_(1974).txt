Roy Moore. It stars [[Olivia Hussey]], [[Keir Dullea]], [[Margot Kidder]], [[Andrea Martin]], [[Lynne Griffin]] and [[John Saxon]]. The story follows a group of sorority sisters who receive threatening phone calls and are eventually stalked and murdered by a deranged killer during the [[Christmas]] season.\n\nInspired by the urban legend \"[[the babysitter and the man upstairs]]\" and a series of murders that took place in the [[Westmount, Quebec|Westmount neighbourhood]] of [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]], Moore wrote the screenplay under the title ''Stop Me''. The filmmakers made numerous alterations to the script, primarily the shifting to a university setting with young adult characters. It was shot in [[Toronto]] in 1974 on an estimated budget of $620,000, and was distributed by [[Warner Bros.]] in North America.\n\nUpon its release, ''Black Christmas'' received mixed reviews, but it has since received critical re-appraisal, with film historians noting it for being one of the earliest slasher films.<ref>{{Cite book |author= Paszylx, Bart\u0142omiej |title=The Pleasure and Pain of Cult Horror Films: An Historical Survey |year=2009 |publisher=McFarland |isbn=978-0-786-43695-8 |pages=135\u20136}}</ref> It is also praised for its influence on [[John Carpenter]]'s ''[[Halloween (1978 film)|Halloween]]'' (1978).

The house phone rings, and [[Jess Bradford]] answers to discover it is an [[obscene phone call]] from a person who has called before known as \"The Moaner\". Jess calls the other sorority girls and they listen as the caller rants, moans, and screams in strange voices. The girls are initially startled by the caller, but Barb, an inebriated student, insults the caller; after a moment of bickering, the caller threatens to kill them in a sudden low tone. A younger student, Clare Harrison, suggests that the caller could be a rapist before returning to her bedroom to pack her suitcase. Right when she leaves, Mrs. MacHenry, the [[housemaster|housemother]], arrives and is immediately given a [[negligee]] by the girls. As Clare packs her things upstairs, she fails to notice the intruder hiding behind a plastic dress bag; Clare eventually hears the cat meowing from the closet and slowly approaches it, only to be suffocated with a plastic dress bag. As the party wraps up, the killer carries Clare\u2019s body into the attic and places her into a rocking chair by the attic window.\n\nThe following morning, Clare's father arrives to take her home for Christmas break, but she fails to show up. Mrs. MacHenry assumes Clare went to the fraternity house for a party, and helps Mr. Harrison look for her. Later that day, Jess goes to a conservatory to meet her boyfriend, Peter, and explains to him that she is pregnant and planning to get an [[abortion]]. This angers Peter, and he forces her to continue this discussion later that night. In town, Mr. Harrison, Barb, and Phyl attempt to report Clare as missing to Sergeant Nash, who doesn\u2019t take them seriously. At the police station, they learn that a [[high school]] girl, Janice Quaife, has also vanished.\n\nAfter putting a drunken Barb to bed, Mr. Harrison, Chris{{Who|date=November 2022}}, Jess, and Phyl help search for the missing girl. Meanwhile, the [[housemaster|housemother]], Mrs. MacHenry, discovers Clare's body and the killer throws a crane hook into her face, hanging and killing her. In the park, the missing girl's disfigured body is found by the police. Jess answers another obscene phone call and decides to file a report with the police, only for Peter to surprise her. He attempts to persuade her into marriage, but she refuses and reaffirms her decision to have an abortion. Peter leaves angrily while Lieutenant Fuller arrives with a telephone lineman to bug the phone.\n\nJess stays up to pick up the phone, but leaves when she hears Barb having an [[asthma|asthma attack]]; Barb claims that she had a nightmare where she saw a man walk into her room. After calming her down, Jess hears Christmas Carolers at the front door and leaves Barb unattended. The killer walks into Barb's room and stabs her to death with a glass unicorn figurine; her cries for help are drowned out by the caroling. Jess experiences another unnerving phone call, in which the caller restates her argument with Peter. Lieutenant Fuller calls her to say the attempt to trace the call failed, and theorizes that Peter could be responsible, but Jess doubts this. After Jess and Phyl are spooked by a couple of search party members, they set out and lock up every door and window in the house. Phyl sees Barb\u2019s door close, and goes to check in on her, only for her to be killed off-screen.\n\nJess gets one final phone call in which the killer alludes to some sort of transgression between two children named Agnes and Billy. The call is long enough to be traced, and Sergeant Nash instructs Jess to leave the house immediately, as the calls are coming from within the house. Concerned for Barb and Phyl, she ventures upstairs, where she discovers their bodies. Jess sees the killer\u2019s eye through a door crack as he slowly begins to close it on her; she slams the door in his face and runs downstairs. Jess flees into the basement and locks it shut as the killer bangs on it. She then hears footsteps walking away and (presumably) the front door opening. However, when she walks downstairs into the basement, Jess sees Peter peek through a window and call her name; he breaks a window and enters the basement as he calls her name worriedly. Once Peter finds her, he begins to approach her as she backs away and clutches the fire poker.\n\nThe police arrive and hear Jess screaming; they discover her barely conscious in the basement with Peter's bloody body next to her. Believing that Peter was the killer, they put Jess to bed, sedated, in her room and leave her alone in the house, with a cop standing outside. The killer's voice is heard from the attic, implying that he is still alive. The still-undiscovered bodies of Clare and Mrs. MacHenry are seen through the attic window before the house's telephone begins to ring, leaving Jess' fate ambiguous.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Olivia Hussey]] as [[Jess Bradford|Jess]]\n* [[Keir Dullea]] as Peter\n* [[Margot Kidder]] as Barb\n* [[John Saxon]] as Lt.
