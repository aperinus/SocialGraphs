Co-written by Campion and [[Gerard Lee]], the film documents the contentious and chaotic relationships among a woman in her twenties, her parents, and her emotionally unstable sister. It was Jane Campion's first feature film. It was entered into the [[1989 Cannes Film Festival]]<ref name=\"festival-cannes.com\">{{cite web |url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/220/year/1989.html |title=Festival de Cannes: Sweetie |accessdate=1 August 2009|work=festival-cannes.com}}</ref> and won an [[Independent Spirit Award for Best International Film|Independent Spirit Award for Best Foreign Film]] in 1991.<ref>{{Cite web |date=19 November 2015 |title=Ten Groundbreaking Film Independent Spirit Awards Wins |url=https://www.filmindependent.org/blog/ten-groundbreaking-film-independent-spirit-awards-wins/ |url-status=live |access-date=17 December 2021 |website=[[Independent Spirit Awards|Film Independent]] |language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nThe story focuses on a dysfunctional Australian family that includes two daughters: Dawn (nicknamed \"Sweetie\"), a plump, lively, often delusional woman who fancies herself an actor, and her thin, sullen, superstitious sister Kay, a factory worker who has a boyfriend named Louis. Their parents, Flo and Gordon, are having serious marital problems.\n\nKay loves Louis because the words of a fortune teller portended she would end up with him. However, the couple's relationship begins to show signs of strain, with Kay uprooting and hiding a tree Louis attempts to plant in their yard because she feels a deep foreboding about it. After an absence, Sweetie returns home with her drug-addicted lover and \"manager\" Bob; she then proceeds to intimidate, control, and abuse the other members of her family. Gordon chooses to ignore Sweetie's mental illness and erratic, childish behavior because he loves her and thinks of her as a child. Throughout the film, there are flashbacks to Sweetie dancing, singing and performing small, circus-like tricks with Gordon's assistance. Flo admits he indulges her.\n\nSweetie's emotional volatility and physical destructiveness (ruining Kay's clothes, breaking furniture) reflects the disruption she has caused her family. Louis breaks up with Kay after mounting tension between the couple. After a series of circular fights (Sweetie rages, her family forgives her, her sweetness and fun persona return), Sweetie completely loses her mind. She strips off her clothes, paints her body black and holes up in her childhood [[tree house]]. Though her family begs her to come down, she refuses and keeps shaking the fort until it falls from the tree, killing her and injuring Flo. Trees continue to play a role even after Sweetie's death, as her private interment is briefly disrupted by a tree root that obstructs her grave.\n\nLouis and Kay get back together, while Kay's family achieves a sort of resolution. They no longer feel manipulated and agitated by Sweetie's presence. However, the best of her personality persists, as Kay and her parents maintain an image of her in her truest form, that of a little girl.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Genevi\u00e8ve Lemon]] as Dawn aka Sweetie\n* Karen Colston as Kay\n* Tom Lycos as Louis\n* Jon Darling as Gordon\n* Dorothy Barry as Flo\n* Michael Lake as Bob\n* Andre Pataczek as Clayton\n* Jean Hadgraft as Mrs. Schneller\n* [[Paul Livingston]] as Teddy Schneller\n* Louise Fox as Cheryl\n* Ann Merchant as Paula\n* Robyn Frank as Ruth (as Robin Frank)\n* Bronwyn Morgan as Sue\n* Sean Fennell as Boy clerk\n* Sean Callinan as Simboo\n\n==Production==\nCampion wanted to make a low-budget contemporary feature.
