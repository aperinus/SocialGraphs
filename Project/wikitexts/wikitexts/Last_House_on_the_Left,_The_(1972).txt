The film follows [[Mari Collingwood]] ([[Sandra Peabody]]), a [[hippie]] teenager who is abducted, raped, and tortured by a [[fugitive]] family on her seventeenth birthday. When they unwittingly seek refuge in her home, the killers face the vengeance of her parents.\n\nCraven based the film on the 1960 Swedish film ''[[The Virgin Spring]]'', directed by [[Ingmar Bergman]], which in turn is an adaptation of the Swedish ballad \"[[T\u00f6res d\u00f6ttrar i W\u00e4nge]]\".<ref>{{Cite web |date=31 August 2015 |title=Wes Craven: the mainstream horror maestro inspired by Ingmar Bergman |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2015/aug/31/wes-craven-the-mainstream-horror-maestro-inspired-by-ingmar-bergman |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150929185406/https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2015/aug/31/wes-craven-the-mainstream-horror-maestro-inspired-by-ingmar-bergman |archive-date=29 September 2015 |website=[[The Guardian]]}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |date=3 September 2015 |title=The Bergman Film That Inspired Wes Craven |url=https://www.criterion.com/current/posts/3688-the-bergman-film-that-inspired-wes-craven |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220823192410/https://www.criterion.com/current/posts/3688-the-bergman-film-that-inspired-wes-craven |archive-date=23 August 2022 |website=[[The Criterion Collection]]}}</ref> Craven developed the film with producer [[Sean S. Cunningham]] after working with him on ''[[Together (1971 film)|Together]]'' (1971) and once the filmmakers obtained small funding from Hallmark Releasing to make another feature film. Craven wrote a script (originally overtly [[Pornographic film|pornographic]]) on the concept of [[shock factor]], wanting to depict violence in a realistic matter. Once casting began, Craven promised the actors auditioning that the film would instead be a traditional [[horror film]].\n\nThe film was initially damaging to Craven's career and was controversial for its marketing, with the [[tagline]] \"Can a movie go too far?\", advertising its violence. While not being a massive box office draw at [[drive-in]]s, it grossed $3 million against a budget of under $90,000. Critics derided the film for its confrontational violence and Craven's use of [[black comedy]]\u2014scenes of [[slapstick]] [[comedy]] intercut with scenes of [[rape]] and [[humiliation]]. However, it has since achieved a [[cult following]] and was nominated for [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Thrills]]. The film was particularly troubling for lead actress Peabody, who recalled struggling filming due to a constantly changing script and suffering abuse from her male co-stars. Many of the other actors involved in the film have expressed regret for starring in it decades after its release.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Film plot summaries should be between 400 and 700 words. -->\n[[Mari Collingwood]] plans to attend a concert with her friend Phyllis Stone, for her seventeenth birthday. Her parents, Estelle and John, express their concern about her friendship with Phyllis, but let her go and give her a peace symbol necklace. Phyllis and Mari head into the city and on the way, they hear a news report of a recent prison escape involving criminals Krug Stillo, a sadistic rapist and serial killer; his [[heroin]]-addicted son, Junior; Sadie, a promiscuous psychopath and sadist; and Fred \"Weasel\" Podowski, a child molester, peeping Tom and murderer. Before the concert, Mari and Phyllis encounter Junior while he is trying to buy [[marijuana]]. He leads them to an apartment where they are trapped by the criminals. Phyllis tries to escape and reason with them, but she fails and is gang-raped. Meanwhile, Mari's unsuspecting parents prepare a surprise party for her.\n\nThe next morning, Mari and Phyllis are bound, gagged and put in the trunk of Krug's car and transported to the woods. Mari recognizes that the road is near her home. Phyllis is forced to urinate in her jeans and Mari and Phyllis are forced to perform sexual acts on each other. Phyllis distracts the kidnappers to give Mari an opportunity to escape but is chased by Sadie and Weasel, while Junior stays behind to guard Mari. Mari tries gaining Junior's trust by giving him her necklace and calling him \"Willow\". Phyllis stumbles across a [[cemetery]] where she is cornered and stabbed by Weasel. She crawls to a nearby tree and is stabbed to death. Mari convinces Junior to let her go, but her escape is halted by Krug. Krug carves his name into her chest, then rapes her. Mari vomits, quietly says a prayer and walks into a nearby lake, where Krug fatally shoots her.\n\nAfter they change out of their bloody clothes, the gang goes to the Collingwoods' home, masquerading as travelling salesmen. Mari's parents let them stay overnight. The gang finds photos of Mari and realize it is her home. Later, when Junior is in the midst of a [[Drug withdrawal|heroin withdrawal]], Estelle enters the bathroom to check on him and sees Mari's peace symbol necklace around his neck. She finds blood-soaked clothing in their luggage and overhears them talking about Mari's death, and of her disposal in a nearby lake.\n\nEstelle and her husband rush into the woods, where they find Mari's body and decide to take revenge. Estelle seduces Weasel, bites off his penis and swallows it, and then leaves him to bleed to death. John takes his shotgun and shoots at Krug and Sadie. Krug escapes into the living room and overpowers John, before manipulating Junior into killing himself. John fetches a chainsaw, and Krug attempts to flee but is incapacitated by an electrocution [[booby-trap]]. Sadie rushes outside and falls into the backyard swimming pool where Estelle slits her throat. The sheriff arrives just as John kills Krug with the chainsaw.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Sandra Peabody]] as [[Mari Collingwood]]\n* Lucy Grantham as Phyllis Stone\n* [[David Hess|David A.

Cunningham]] made his directorial debut with the 1970 [[Sexploitation#White coaters|white coater]] film ''[[The Art of Marriage]]'', which grossed $100,000. The film attracted the attention of Steve Minasian's company Hallmark Releasing,{{sfn|Corman|Cregan|2003|loc=event occurs at 1:26}} which had a distribution partnership with [[American International Pictures]].{{sfn|Lucas|2007|p=860}}{{sfn|Craig|2019|p=8}} Cunningham made the 1971 film ''[[Together (1971 film)|Together]]'' as a \"[[Remake|better version]]\" of ''The Art of Marriage''.{{sfn|Corman|Cregan|2003|loc=event occurs at 1:26}} [[Wes Craven]], who had no money at the time, was put on the job of synchronizing dailies for ''Together''{{sfn|Corman|Cregan|2003|loc=event occurs at 1:30}} and soon began editing the film with Cunningham, with whom he became good friends. Hallmark bought the film for $10,000, and it was considered a \"hit\", prompting the company to persuade Cunningham and Craven to make another film with a bigger budget; the company then gave them $90,000 to shoot a horror film.{{sfn|Corman|Cregan|2003|loc=event occurs at 5:33}}\n\nCunningham served as producer and Craven served as writer and director on the project.{{sfn|Corman|Cregan|2003|loc=event occurs at 1:20}} Written by Craven in 1971, the original script was intended to be a graphic \"[[Hardcore pornography|hardcore]]\" film, with all actors and crew being committed to filming it as such.{{sfn|Corman|Cregan|2003|loc=event occurs at 6:39}} However, after shooting began, the decision was made to edit the script to be less harsh. This script, written under the title ''Night of Vengeance'', has never been released; only a brief glimpse is visible in the featurette ''Celluloid Crime of the Century'', a 2003 documentary on the making of the film.{{sfn|Corman|Cregan|2003|loc=event occurs at 4:27}} The crux of the plot is based on the Swedish ballad \"[[T\u00f6res d\u00f6ttrar i W\u00e4nge]]\",{{sfn|Muir|2002|p=210}} which itself was the basis of [[Ingmar Bergman]]'s 1960 film ''[[The Virgin Spring]]'', of which Craven was an admirer.{{sfn|Corman|Cregan|2003|loc=event occurs at 3:39}} Craven envisioned a film in which the violence would be shown in detail onscreen, as he felt that many popular films of the era, such as [[Western film|Westerns]], glamorized violence and the \"vigilante hero\", and gave the public a misleading representation of death in the wake of the [[Vietnam War]].{{sfn|Corman|Cregan|2003|loc=event occurs at 2:40}}\n\n===Casting===\nThe majority of the cast of ''The Last House on the Left'' were inexperienced or first-time actors, with the exception of Richard Towers, Eleanor Shaw and [[Sandra Peabody]], who were all [[soap opera]] regulars and had prior film roles.{{sfn|Corman|Cregan|2003|loc=event occurs at 16:20}}{{sfn|Szulkin|2000|p=39}} Cunningham and Craven held casting calls for the film at Cunningham's office in [[Midtown Manhattan]] in late 1971.{{sfn|Corman|Cregan|2003|loc=event occurs at }} Peabody, who was returning to New York after a cross-country road trip, signed on to the film after responding to a casting notice in the trade publication ''Backstage''. Cunningham and Craven originally wanted her to read for the role of Phyllis; however, after meeting her, they decided to cast her in the lead role of Mari.{{sfn|Szulkin|2000|p=40}} Shaw was a prominent soap opera actress, and Towers worked as a talent agent in addition to acting.{{sfn|Szulkin|2000|p=39}} Although she did not recall the specific circumstances of how she became involved with the project, Lucy Grantham was ultimately cast in the role of Mari's best friend Phyllis.{{sfn|Corman|Cregan|2003|loc=event occurs at 6:57}}{{sfn|Szulkin|2000|p=40}} The role of the lead villain, Krug Stillo, was given to [[David Hess]], also a musician and songwriter.{{sfn|Corman|Cregan|2003|loc=event occurs at 11:50}} [[Jeramie Rain]], then twenty-one years old, was playing [[Susan Atkins]] in an [[Off-Broadway]] production based on the [[Manson family]] murders. Despite the fact that the original script called for an actress in her forties, Rain was awarded the part of Sadie.{{sfn|Corman|Cregan|2003|loc=event occurs at 8:13}} [[Fred J.

For example, for the sequence in which Phyllis is disemboweled, Lincoln helped craft fake [[intestine]]s with [[condom]]s filled with fake blood and sand.{{sfn|Corman|Cregan|2003|loc=event occurs at 24:47}} For the murder sequence of Sadie in the swimming pool, Rain had a pouch full of fake blood attached underneath her shirt, as well as blood capsules in her mouth, which she manually punctured.{{sfn|Corman|Cregan|2003|loc=event occurs at 24:12}} Grantham recalled that during the scene in which Hess's character tells her to \"piss her pants\", she in fact urinated in her jeans.<ref name=only/> [[Steve Miner]], who would later become a director himself, served as a production assistant on the film.<ref name=only>{{cite AV media|people=Carson, Greg (dir.)|title=It's Only a Movie|medium=DVD Documentary featurette|publisher=[[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] Home Video|year=2002}}</ref>\n\nHess recalled that much of the cast bonded heavily during the filming process since they were mostly inexperienced actors.{{sfn|Corman|Cregan|2003|loc=event occurs at 15:10}} In the 2003 documentary ''Celluloid Crime of the Century'', Lincoln, Rain and Sheffler recalled similar memories which recounted the making of the film. However, both Hess and director Craven recalled the on-set relationship between Hess and Peabody to be turbulent.{{sfn|Corman|Cregan|2003|loc=event occurs at 18:54}} Peabody was often treated differently than the rest of the cast to the point that Craven recalled there \"not being much acting\" during the shooting of the film's more violent scenes.{{sfn|Corman|Cregan|2003|loc=event occurs at 19:05}} Sheffler admitted during a one-on-one sequence with Peabody that he threatened to push her over a cliff if she failed to hit her marks.{{sfn|Corman|Cregan|2003|loc=event occurs at 20:39}}\n\nPeabody stated that she was genuinely upset during the filming of the more violent scenes as she felt unprepared: \"I was upset because I'm an emotional person, and I reacted to what was going on as if it were real. I had a really hard time with some of scenes, because I had come out of ''[[American Playhouse]]'', where it was all about preparation, and everything had to be real. I ended up doing a horrible job in the film. I was very upset, and I felt like I should have channeled that, but I couldn't... I was a young actress and I was still learning to balance any emotions I had from outside of the film into my scene work.\"{{sfn|Szulkin|2000|p=50}} Hess revealed that he actually got very physical with her during the filming of the rape scene, and that she could not do anything about it once the camera was running.{{sfn|Szulkin|2000|p=79}} During this particular shot, assistant director Yvonne Hannemann described it as an upsetting shoot, with her having to be consoled by Craven throughout filming.{{sfn|Szulkin|2000|p=79}} Peabody recalled, \"One of the characters was a method actor, so he was trying to live his part... he'd come after us with a knife at night, trying to freak us out. This was the guy with the dark curly hair [David Hess] - he tried to play his role on and off the set. It was like, 'Lock your doors and windows at night, you don't want him to come get you!' I was scared; I thought this guy had been a killer at some point in his past!\"{{sfn|Szulkin|2000|p=50}} Sandra states that although she was uncertain how a lot of the scenes would turn out, she trusted Craven and Cunningham and their vision for the film.{{sfn|Szulkin|2000|p=50}}\n\n===Music===\nThe film's soundtrack was written by Stephen Chapin and [[David Hess]] (who also played the main antagonist, Krug); Chapin wrote all the incidental music, arrangements and orchestration, as well as all the contracting and producing musicians. The music was deliberately written to break with established, conventional horror film scores at that point, employing a mix of 1960s [[folk rock]] and [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]]. It also ran counter to the horror film convention of punctuating moments of fright with shock effects; during some of the film's most violent scenes, music that is completely at odds with the visual content plays.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Lerner |first1=Neil |title=Music in the Horror Film: Listening to Fear |date=2009 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-1-135-28044-4 |url=https://www.google.com/books/edition/Music_in_the_Horror_Film/7VyOAgAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1 |access-date=12 February 2021 |language=en}}</ref>\n\nIn 2013, the soundtrack had a re-release on vinyl, compact disc, cassette, and digital download through One Way Static Records.
