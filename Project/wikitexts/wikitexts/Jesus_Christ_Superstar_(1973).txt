As they make their preparations and dance to the film's [[overture]], [[Carl Anderson (singer)|Carl Anderson]], already in character as [[Judas Iscariot]], wanders away from the group.\n\nJudas is worried about Jesus' popularity; he is being hailed as the son of God, but Judas feels he has too much faith in his own message and fears the consequences of their growing movement. He calls out Jesus' association with the likes of [[Mary Magdalene]] (historically accused of being a [[Prostitution|prostitute]]), as well as the fact that Jesus does not give to the poor despite having a lot of money. Meanwhile, temple priests including [[Caiaphas]], [[Annas]] and the [[Pharisees]] are worried that the [[Roman Empire|Romans]] will see Jesus's popularity as an uprising and all agree he must be executed.\n\nWhen Jesus and his followers joyfully arrive in [[Jerusalem]], he rejects both Caiaphas' orders to disband the crowd and the suggestions of [[Simon the Zealot|Simon]] and fellow Zealots to direct the crowd towards an uprising against their [[Iudaea Province|Roman occupiers]]. Jesus then visits a temple where he is furious to see it has been taken over by money changers and prostitutes and, to Judas's horror, destroys the stalls and forces the vendors to leave. While Jesus wanders in the desert and heals a [[leprosy|leper]] colony, Judas goes to the priests and expresses his concerns, along with his worries about the consequences of betraying Jesus. Taking advantage of Judas' doubts, the priests offer him money for leading them to Jesus. Judas reveals that Jesus will be at the [[Garden of Gethsemane]] on Thursday night.\n\nAt the [[Last Supper]] in the garden, Jesus expresses skepticism about his apostles loyalty, stating that [[Saint Peter|Peter]] will deny him and Judas will betray him. A bitter argument between Jesus and Judas ensues, as Judas angrily accuses Jesus of losing sight of their cause.\nJudas leaves and returns with guards, fulfilling his betrayal, while Peter denies being with Jesus to members of the populace. The guards take Jesus to Caiaphas, who finds him guilty of [[blasphemy]]. He is then sent to [[Pontius Pilate]], the Roman governor of Judea, but since he does not deal with Jews, Pilate sends Jesus to [[Herod Antipas|King Herod]]. Herod urges Jesus to perform various miracles, but dismisses him as a fraud when he does not. Blaming God for giving him the role of the betrayer, Judas is overcome by grief and regret and hangs himself.\n\nJesus is taken back to Pilate, who believes Jesus is delusional but has committed no actual crime, yet he is pressured by the crowd to condemn Jesus to death. Confused and enraged at Jesus' inexplicable resignation and refusal to defend himself, Pilate realizes he has no option but to have Jesus crucified to quell the angry masses. Jesus is led up to [[Golgotha]] and [[Sayings of Jesus on the cross|says his final words]] before dying on the cross. The film's cast, now out of costume, reunite and board the bus to leave, with [[Barry Dennen]], [[Yvonne Elliman]] and Carl Anderson the only ones who notice that [[Ted Neely]], who played Jesus, is missing.\n\n== Production ==\n[[File:Jesus Christ Superstar Elliman Neeley 1973.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Yvonne Elliman and Ted Neeley as Mary Magdalene and Jesus]]\n\n=== Development ===\nDuring filming of ''[[Fiddler on the Roof (film)|Fiddler on the Roof]]'' (1971), [[Barry Dennen]], who had a minor role in the film, provided a [[concept album]] by [[Andrew Lloyd Webber]] and [[Tim Rice]] to [[Norman Jewison]], ''[[Jesus Christ Superstar (album)|Jesus Christ Superstar]]'' (1970), where Dennen voiced Pilate. At that time, the LP, despite its [[Superstar (Jesus Christ Superstar song)|title song]] being a hit single, was \"met with a massive dose of British indifference, even condescension\", recalled Webber, and was thought of by ''Fiddler on the Roof'' producer Patrick Palmer as an \"obscure album from England\" when Jewison first obtained it.<ref name = \"Quillette\"/> Jewison described himself as \"curiously moved\" and \"flooded with exciting visual images\" when first hearing the record, amazed by its ability to execute so much without spoken lines.<ref name = \"Quillette\"/><ref name = \"NassourBroderick73\"/>{{rp|216}} He first publicly expressed interest in directing a film based on the album in an interview at the New York premiere of ''Fiddler on the Roof'': \"I could see it as an exciting innovative movie just as it was\u2014just music and lyrics, no dialogue.\"<ref name = \"NassourBroderick73\"/>{{rp|216}}\n\nJewison, after finding out [[MCA Records]] owned the film rights, contacted [[Lew Wasserman]] for the chance of directing a film adaptation of the musical. Although other directors were considered, Jewison's past filmography plus his blueprint for the film influenced Universal to hire him.<ref name = \"NassourBroderick73\"/>{{rp|216}} A meeting between Jewison, Webber, and [[Universal Pictures]] executive [[Ned Tanen]] soon followed.<ref name = \"Quillette\"/> Weber agreed to the film project, citing Jewison's experience with ''Fiddler on the Roof'', an adaptation of a musical with religious themes.<ref name = \"Quillette\"/>\n\nThe latest stage production of ''Jesus Christ Superstar'' before the film was a [[Robert Stigwood]]-produced Broadway run in 1970. Budgeted at more than $1,000,000, not counting Stigwood's own financial contributions, the show profited $700,000 with an overcall $8,557.83. However, its run was shorter than planned. Professional reviews were overwhelmingly abysmal, and, commercially, the show declined by its eighth month as a result of decrease in advance ticket purchases and prices being too high for the show's young fanbase. Within 11 months, the run sustained with Sunday matinees and discount prices for certain shows. Broadway insiders felt it would last up until the film adaptation's release.<ref name = \"NassourBroderick73\"/>{{rp|212}}\n\nWork on the script began with drafting from [[Tim Rice]]. His vision was an [[epic film]] in the style of ''[[Ben-Hur (1959 film)|Ben-Hur]]'' (1959), summarizing his workflow as figuring out \"which massive visual effect accompanied which song\".<ref name = \"Quillette\"/> However, Jewison's concept differed, and thus Rice's draft was scrapped.<ref name = \"Quillette\"/> Alongside [[Melvyn Bragg]], Jewison wrote a screenplay as a [[pastische]] that combined biblical and modern elements of culture, particularly with its theater group framing device.<ref name = \"Quillette\"/> Bragg, who had already established himself as a television writer, was a co-writer of the screenplay.

As he wrote, \"there is a spirit in the country and among its people that grabs you, and if you spend any time there you will never be the same.\"<ref name = \"Quillette\"/> Elliman, Neeley, and Anderson each received $16,500 for their roles ($108,624 in 2022), while Jewison was paid reduced fee of $15,000 ($98,749 in 2022), in exchange for 10% of the film's worldwide profits.<ref name = \"Quillette\"/>\n\nShooting began on August 18, 1972, in the caves of [[Eleutheropolis|Beit Gubrin]] (today the [[Beit Guvrin National Park]]), following days of cleaning up fecal matter from birds and bats. Used for the segments for \"What\u2019s the Buzz?\", \"Strange Thing Mystifying\", and \"Everything's Alright\", the location was chosen by Jewison to make Jesus and his Apostles look like an underground movement of rock artists; in fact, he cast little-known rock musicians for the Apostles, and only two of them had prior experience in film.<ref name = \"Quillette\"/> Production then moved to the [[West Bank]], which had been [[Israeli occupation of the West Bank|occupied by Israeli]] following the [[Six-Day War]]. Choreographer [[Robert Iscove]] recalled, \"Arabs with machine guns came over the hill, pointing at us. They were from a neighbouring village and there had been some tiff that had nothing to do with the actual war.\"<ref name = \"Quillette\"/> For most sequences, Iscove determined the location on the first day of its choreography, and the dancing and camerawork would be improvised based on the location. \"King Herod's Song\" and \"Superstar\" were the only ones that had their locations planned before production commenced.<ref name = \"Quillette\"/> The abandoned Nabataean city of [[Avdat]] was used for the scenes with the Roman priests.<ref name = \"Quillette\"/>\n\nFor most of the actors, who were secular [[hippies]], filming the musical submerged them in the religious setting. During breaks, they played the concept album loudly, read ''[[Aquarian Gospel of Jesus the Christ]]'' (1908), and had volleyball matches the teams being \"Judas\" and \"Jesus\".<ref name = \"Quillette\"/> The 46-year-old Jewison, when not filming, rarely interacted with the cast members.<ref name = \"Quillette\"/> Neeley wrote that, during filming of the crucifixion, the cast felt like they were walking on the path Christ took, and cried at Neeley's performance on the cross.<ref name = \"Quillette\"/>\n\n=== Companies ===\nAs producer [[Robert Stigwood]] was not yet known to have formed \"The Robert Stigwood Organization,\" ''Jesus Christ Superstar'' is not generally considered a production of '''RSO Films,''' the movies-and-television arm of that organization. Nor, in spite of Andrew Lloyd Webber having composed the musical score, is the film commonly identified with '''\"The Really Useful Company,\"''' through which Lloyd Webber was doing most of his stage and screen work as of late November 2020. The film '''''is''''' considered a [[Universal Pictures|Universal Picture]], since Universal did fund and distribute it.\n\n===Alterations===\nLike the stage show, the film gave rise to controversy even with changes made to the script. Some of the lyrics were changed for the film. The reprise of \"Everything's Alright\", sung before the song \"I Don't Know How to Love Him\" by Mary to Jesus, was abridged, leaving only the closing lyric \"Close your eyes, close your eyes and relax, think of nothing tonight\" intact, while the previous lyrics were omitted, including Jesus' \"And I think I shall sleep well tonight.\". In a scene where a group of beggars and lepers overwhelms Jesus, \"Heal yourselves!\" was changed to \"Leave me alone!\", and in \"Judas' Death\", Caiaphas' line \"What you have done will be the saving of Israel\" was changed to \"What you have done will be the saving of everyone.\"\n\nThe lyrics of \"Trial Before Pilate\" contain some notable alterations and additions. Jesus' line \"There may be a kingdom for me somewhere, if I only knew\" is changed to \"if you only knew.\" The film version also gives Pilate more lines (first used in the original Broadway production) in which he addresses the mob with contempt when they invoke the name of Caesar: \"What is this new/Respect for Caesar?/Till now this has been noticeably lacking!/Who is this Jesus? Why is he different?/You Jews produce messiahs by the sackful!\" and \"Behold a man/Behold your shattered king/You hypocrites!/You hate us more than him!\" These lines for Pilate have since been in every production of the show.\n\nThe soundtrack contains two songs that are not on the original concept album. \"Then We Are Decided\", in which the troubles and fears of Annas and Caiaphas regarding Jesus are better developed, is original to the film. The soundtrack also retains the song \"Could We Start Again Please?\" which had been added to the Broadway show and to stage productions. Most of the other changes have not been espoused by later productions and recordings, although most productions tend to retain the expanded version of \"Trial Before Pilate\".\n\n== Reception ==\n=== Context ===\n{{See also|1973 in film}}\n1972\u20131973 was a period of declining interest in religion worldwide, but also filled with movies with religious themes, such as ''Jesus Christ Superstar'', ''[[Godspell (film)|Godspell]]'', ''[[Gospel Road: A Story of Jesus]]'', ''[[Brother Sun, Sister Moon]]'', ''[[Siddhartha (1972 film)|Siddhartha]]'', ''[[Greaser's Palace]]'', ''[[Marjoe]]'', and ''[[The Exorcist (film)|The Exorcist]]''.<ref name = \"TheologyToday\">{{cite journal|last=Pomeroy|first=David W.|date=April 1, 1974|url=https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/004057367403100106|title=1973\u2014Year of the Religious Film|journal=[[Theology Today]]|volume=31|number=1|doi=10.1177/004057367403100106|pages=47\u201349|s2cid=170365840|access-date=November 17, 2021}}</ref> David W.
