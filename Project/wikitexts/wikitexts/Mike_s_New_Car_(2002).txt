Directed by [[Pete Docter]] and Roger L. Gould, it is the first Pixar short to use dialogue and the first to take characters and situations from a previously established work.\n\nThe short premiered on September 17, 2002, included in the [[DVD]] and [[VHS]] release of ''[[Monsters, Inc.]]''<ref name=\"DVD\" /> It was nominated for a 2002 Academy Award for [[Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film|Best Animated Short Film]].<ref>{{cite web|title=The 75th Academy Awards (2003) Nominees and Winners|url=http://www.oscars.org/awards/academyawards/legacy/ceremony/75th-winners.html|work=The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences|access-date=March 12, 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nMike is obsessed with his new [[six-wheel drive]] [[car]] and happily insists on showing it off to Sulley, who is confused about what happened to his old car, but Mike likes his new car. Unfortunately for Mike, [[Murphy's law|anything that can go wrong does go wrong]]. Sulley plays with the adjustable [[power seat]] until an annoyed Mike snaps at him to stop. Mike starts the [[engine]] and hears the seatbelt reminder tone sound chiming.\n\nAlthough Sulley manages to get his seatbelt on easily, Mike finds his seatbelt stuck and accidentally locks himself out of the car while falling out in an attempt to unstick it. Mike instructs Sulley to push a button so he can get back in. Sulley, confused by the massive amount of buttons on the dashboard, pushes the one that opens the [[Hood (vehicle)|hood]]. When Mike goes over to close it, he is unable to reach it. Sulley helps him close the hood but accidentally closes it on Mike's fingers causing him to scream in pain. Sulley helps Mike get free only to trap him in the engine compartment completely.\n\nMike calls Sulley on his [[cell phone]] and instructs him to open the hood again. When he does this, Mike manages to escape. When he reenters the car, he is annoyed by the continuous seatbelt reminder tone still chiming. Mike manages to put his seat-belt on, but the windshield wipers randomly turn on, annoying him even more. As Sulley tries to help, Mike tells him not to touch anything and decides to do it himself. Mike pushes a button that launches the entire car into chaotic malfunction, including [[Conga (music)|conga]] music playing loudly on the car's stereo system. Jerry Slugworth appears looking at the car and then running away.\n\nHowever, Mike finally ends the chaos by pulling the key out of the ignition, and Sulley adds insult to injury by accidentally breaking the rearview mirror in an attempt to realign it. Now at his wit's end, Mike forces Sulley out of the car and speeds away, resulting in the car's destruction. Sulley says: \"Huh, that's weird. The [[airbag]] didn't go off.\" Right after he finishes saying this, the airbag immediately inflates and its force sends Mike flying back up the street. Sulley catches Mike, who confesses to him that Mike says: \"I miss my old car.\" Following this, Mike reminisces about his old car before agreeing to walk to work as the end credits are displayed.\n\n==Voice cast==\n* [[Billy Crystal]] as Michael \"Mike\" Wazowski\n* [[John Goodman]] as James P. \"Sulley\" Sullivan\n\n==Home media==\n''Mike's New Car'' was released on September 17, 2002, attached as bonus feature on the ''Monsters, Inc.''
