Jake's visions are dismissed by his mother, stepfather, and psychiatrists as nightmares resulting from the trauma of his father's death the previous year.\n\nAt his apartment home in [[New York City]], a group of workers from an alleged [[psychiatric facility]] offer to rehabilitate Jake; recognizing them from his visions as monsters wearing human skin, Jake flees from them, and they give chase. Jake finds an abandoned house from one of his visions where he discovers a high-tech portal that leads to a [[Apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction|post-apocalyptic]] landscape called [[Mid-World]].\n\nIn Mid-World, Jake encounters the Gunslinger, [[Roland Deschain]], who has emerged in his visions. Roland is pursuing [[Randall Flagg|Walter Padick]] who has also appeared in Jake's dreams, seeking to kill him as revenge for the murder of his father, Steven, and all remaining Gunslingers. He explains to Jake that for decades, Walter has been abducting children with psychic powers, attempting to use their [[The Shining (novel)|\"shine\"]]<ref>{{Cite web|date=2020-09-16|title=The Shining: What \"The Shine\" Really Is Explained (Origins & Powers)|url=https://screenrant.com/shining-doctor-sleep-stephen-king-shine-origins-powers/|access-date=2022-02-12|website=ScreenRant|language=en-US}}</ref> to bring down the Dark Tower, a fabled structure located at the center of the Universe. This will allow [[Crimson King|monstrous being]]s from the darkness outside to invade and destroy reality.\n \nRoland takes Jake to a local village in order to have his visions interpreted by a seer. Having learned of Jake's escape, Walter investigates and discovers from his minion Sayre that Jake has \"pure Shine\", enough psychic potential to destroy the Dark Tower single-handedly. Walter kills Jake's stepfather; then he interrogates his mother about her son's visions.\n\nBack in Mid-World, the seer determines that the machine is six months away on foot and portal access is restricted to Walter's bases. Jake realizes that Walter has a base in New York that they can use to reach the machine. Suddenly, the Taheen, Walter's minions, attack the village \u2013 but Roland kills many of them. Roland and Jake return to Earth where Roland's injuries are treated at a hospital. Jake learns the location of Walter's base from a homeless man who helped him earlier. When Jake returns home to check in on his mother, he finds her charred remains and breaks down in tears. Seeing this, Roland vows to avenge her death. This leads to him teaching Jake the basics of gun fighting, as well as the Gunslinger's Creed, which he has not uttered since his own father's death.\n\nAs Roland replenishes his weapons supply at a gun store, he is attacked by Walter, who captures Jake and takes him through a portal at his base to a machine that will destroy the Dark Tower with Jake's powers. Jake uses these psychic powers to alert Roland to the portal code he needs and Roland battles his way through Walter's henchmen, reopening the portal, which Jake forces to stay open. Walter is forced to return to New York to fight Roland and wounds him. When Jake reminds him of the Gunslinger's Creed, Roland recovers and kills Walter with a trick shot after a brief fight. Finally he destroys the machine and saves the Dark Tower, Jake, and the other children.\n\nAs the film ends, Roland prepares to return to his own world and offers Jake a place by his side as his companion. Jake accepts the offer and the two head back to Mid-World together.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Idris Elba]] as [[Roland Deschain]], the last of the Gunslingers.<ref name=\"announcement\">{{cite magazine |url=http://www.ew.com/article/2016/02/29/dark-tower-rises-stephen-king-idris-elba-and-matthew-mcconaughey |last=Breznican |first=Anthony |title=The Dark Tower rises|magazine=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |access-date=March 11, 2016 |date=March 1, 2016 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160417081459/http://www.ew.com/article/2016/02/29/dark-tower-rises-stephen-king-idris-elba-and-matthew-mcconaughey |archive-date=April 17, 2016}}</ref> On the choice of Elba, director and co-writer [[Nikolaj Arcel]] stated, \"For me, it just clicked.

However, in May 2009, Abrams stated to IGN that he and Lindelof were planning on beginning work on ''The Dark Tower'' as soon as ''Lost'' finished its run.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://bloody-disgusting.com/news/16074/|title=J.J.

In an interview with ''[[USA Today]]'' in October 2009, Damon Lindelof stated: \"You'll be hard-pressed to find a huger fan of ''The Dark Tower'' than me, but that's probably the reason that I shouldn't be the one to adapt it. After working six years on ''Lost'', the last thing I want to do is spend the next seven years adapting one of my favorite books of all time.

The series was intended to provide the backstory of the film, being based on King's ''[[The Dark Tower IV: Wizard and Glass]]'', ''[[The Dark Tower: The Wind Through the Keyhole]]'' and elements of ''[[The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger]]'', with another actor playing young Roland, and Haysbert attached to return as Steven Deschain. Mazzara said that the series would explore \"how Walter became the Man in Black, and how their rivalry cost Roland everything and everyone he ever loved\", though McConaughey did not initially sign on for the series.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.ew.com/article/2016/09/21/dark-tower-tv-series-stephen-king-wizard-glass|title='The Dark Tower' TV Series Will Adapt Stephen King's 'Wizard and Glass'|magazine=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160922153401/http://www.ew.com/article/2016/09/21/dark-tower-tv-series-stephen-king-wizard-glass|archive-date=September 22, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://empireonline.com/people/stephen-king/walking-dead-veteran-glen-mazzara-run-dark-tower-tv-series/|title=Walking Dead Veteran Glen Mazzara To Run The Dark Tower TV Series|magazine=[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]|last=White|first=James|date=August 3, 2017|access-date=August 9, 2017}}</ref>\n\nWhile discussing the development of the series in the aftermath of the negative critical response to the film, King expressed \"we'll see what happens with that.
