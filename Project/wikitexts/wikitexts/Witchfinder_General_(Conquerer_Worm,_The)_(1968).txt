Hopkins and his assistant, [[John Stearne (witch-hunter)|John Stearne]], visit village after village, brutally torturing confessions out of suspected witches. They charge the local magistrates for the work they carry out.\n\nRichard Marshall is a young [[Roundhead]]. After surviving a brief skirmish and killing his first enemy soldier (and thus saving the life of his Captain), he rides home to [[Brandeston]], [[Suffolk]], to visit his lover Sara. Sara is the niece of the village priest, John Lowes. Lowes gives his permission to Marshall to marry Sara, telling him there is trouble coming to the village, and he wants Sara far away before it arrives. Marshall asks Sara why the old man is frightened. She tells him they have been threatened and become outcasts in their own village. Marshall vows to Sara, \"rest easy and no one shall harm you. I put my oath to that.\" At the end of his army leave, Marshall rides back to join his regiment and chances upon Hopkins and Stearne on the path. Marshall gives the two men directions to Brandeston then rides on.\n\nIn Brandeston, Hopkins and Stearne immediately begin rounding up suspects. Lowes is accused at his home and tortured. He has needles stuck into his back (in an attempt to locate the so-called \"[[Witches' mark|Devil's Mark]]\") and is about to be killed when Sara stops Hopkins by offering him sexual favours in exchange for her uncle's safety. However, soon Hopkins is called away to another village. Stearne takes advantage of Hopkins' absence by raping Sara. When Hopkins returns and finds out what Stearne has done, Hopkins will have nothing further to do with the young woman. He instructs Stearne to begin torturing Lowes again. Shortly before departing the village, Hopkins and Stearne execute Lowes and two women.\n\nMarshall returns to Brandeston and is horrified by what has happened to Sara. He vows to kill both Hopkins and Stearne. After \"marrying\" Sara in a ceremony of his own devising and instructing her to flee to [[Lavenham]], he rides off by himself. In the meantime, Hopkins and Stearne have become separated after a Roundhead patrol attempts to commandeer their horses. Marshall locates Stearne, but after a brutal fight, Stearne is able to escape. He reunites with Hopkins and informs him of Marshall's desire for revenge.\n\nHopkins and Stearne enter the village of Lavenham. On a patrol to locate the King, Marshall learns they are there and quickly rides to the village with a group of his soldier friends. However, having earlier learned that Sara was in Lavenham, Hopkins has set a trap to capture Marshall. Hopkins and Stearne frame Marshall and Sara as witches and take them to the castle to be interrogated. Marshall watches as needles are repeatedly jabbed into Sara's back, but he refuses to confess to witchcraft, instead vowing again to kill Hopkins. He breaks free from his bonds and stamps on Stearne's face while his army comrades approach the castle dungeon. Marshall grabs an axe and repeatedly strikes Hopkins. The soldiers enter the room and are horrified to see what their friend has done. One of them, Marshall's friend Trooper Swallow, puts the mutilated but still living Hopkins out of his misery by shooting him dead. Marshall's mind snaps, and he shouts, \"You took him from me! You took him from me!\" Sara, also apparently on the brink of insanity, screams uncontrollably over and over again.\n\n== Cast ==\n[[File:Vincent Price in House on Haunted Hill (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Photo of Vincent Price|Vincent Price in 1959]]\n{{castlist|\n* [[Vincent Price]] as [[Matthew Hopkins]]\n* [[Ian Ogilvy]] as [[Cornet (rank)|Cornet]] Richard Marshall\n* [[Hilary Dwyer]] as Sara Lowes\n* [[Rupert Davies]] as John Lowes\n* [[Robert Russell (English actor)|Robert Russell]] as [[John Stearne (witch-hunter)|John Stearne]]\n* [[Patrick Wymark]] as [[Oliver Cromwell]]\n* [[Nicky Henson]] as Trooper Swallow\n* [[Wilfrid Brambell]] as Master Loach\n* [[Tony Selby]] as Salter\n* [[Bernard Kay]] as Gore\n* [[Godfrey James]] as Webb\n* Michael Beint as Captain Gordon\n* John Trenaman as Trooper Harcourt\n* Bill Maxwell as Gifford\n* Paul Ferris as Paul\n* Maggie Kimberly as Elizabeth\n* [[Margaret Nolan]] as Girl at Inn\n}}\n== Production ==\n=== Background ===\n[[File:Matthew Hopkins.png|thumb|Matthew Hopkins confronting witches and their \"[[familiar|imps]]\"]]\nFrom 1645 to 1647, [[Matthew Hopkins]] and [[John Stearne (witch-hunter)|John Stearne]] travelled the east of England as [[witch-hunt|witch hunters]]. They harshly interrogated suspected witches (using methods such as [[sleep deprivation]]), examined them by [[pricking]] for a [[witch's mark]], or sometimes threw an accused witch into water for a \"[[cucking stool|swimming test]]\". Local authorities paid for these services, plus expenses. Shortly before his death from [[tuberculosis|consumption]] in 1647, Hopkins published ''The Discovery of Witches'', his treatise on witch hunting. In one of its illustrations, he was labeled the \"Witch Finder Generall\".\n\n[[Ronald Bassett]]'s ''[[Witchfinder General (novel)|Witchfinder General]]'', a novel loosely based on the historical Hopkins and Stearne, was published in 1966. [[Tony Tenser]], the founder and chief executive of [[Tigon British Film Productions]], read Bassett's book while it was still in [[galley proof|galley]] form and purchased the [[film rights]] on impulse before publication. Tenser felt it \"had some scope, had some breadth to it; there was canvas for a film\".{{sfn|Halligan|2003|p=107}}\n\n=== Writing ===\nMichael Reeves, who had just completed Tigon's ''[[The Sorcerers]]'' (1967) starring [[Boris Karloff]], provided a story outline which met with Tenser's enthusiastic approval. Tenser immediately began putting together a preliminary budget, and requested that Reeves quickly complete a full film script, stressing to Reeves that the production would need to commence by September of that year to avoid shooting during cold weather. Reeves called in his childhood friend Tom Baker (who had co-written ''The Sorcerers'' with Reeves) to assist him with the script.{{sfn|Halligan|2003|p=107}} Reeves and Baker began drafting a screenplay with [[Donald Pleasence]] firmly in mind as the film's star.{{sfn|Halligan|2003|pp=107\u2013108}} However, once [[American International Pictures]] became involved in the production, they insisted that their contract star, [[Vincent Price]], be given the lead, and Pleasence was dropped from the film.<ref name=\"Williams\">{{cite book |last= Williams |first=  Lucy Chase |title= The Complete Films of Vincent Price |publisher= Citadel Press |year= 1995 |isbn= 0-8065-1600-3}}</ref> With the abrupt change of star, Reeves and Baker had to rethink their original concept of presenting Hopkins as \"ineffective and inadequate&nbsp;\u2026 a ridiculous authority figure\", which they had believed Pleasence could play to perfection. They knew the tall, imposing Price, with his long history of horror roles, would have to be more of a straightforward villain, and they made changes to their script accordingly.{{sfn|Halligan|2003|p=118}}\n\nAs was required by law for British film productions of that time, the completed first draft of the screenplay was presented by Tenser to the [[British Board of Film Classification|British Board of Film Censors]] (BBFC) on 4 August to determine if any possible censorship issues could be anticipated. On the same day, a preliminary report was issued by a BBFC examiner, who, commenting that Tenser was an \"ape\", referred to the screenplay as \"perfectly beastly\" and \"ghoulish\". The script was returned to Tenser a few days later, with a more detailed report from the same examiner, which described the screenplay as \"a study in sadism in which every detail of cruelty and suffering is lovingly dwelt on&nbsp;\u2026 a film which followed the script at all closely would run into endless censorship trouble.\" After a second draft was written and sent to the BBFC only eleven days after the first draft, the reaction was nearly the same. It was returned to Tenser with an \"exhaustive list\" of requirements to reduce the film's possible offensiveness.{{sfn|Halligan|2003|pp=120\u2013122}}\n\nReeves and Baker completed a third and final draft that was \"substantially toned down\" in content from the previous attempts. This version of the screenplay, which was filmed with only a few minor revisions during the production, was missing many of the more explicit moments of violence described in the first submitted drafts: the death spasms of the [[pre-credit]]s hanging victim, Lowes getting stabbed fifteen times with a steel spike, and a sniper's victim somersaulting through the air and slamming into a tree. A sequence depicting the [[Battle of Naseby]] was to be filmed, during which a soldier's head was to be cut off on screen. Most significantly, the film's finale was completely altered. In the original ending, Stearne falls in with a group of gypsies and attempts to rape one of their women, who successfully fights off her attacker by plunging her thumbs into his eyes, blinding him. The gypsies then stake him to death. Marshall arrives and convinces the gypsies to assist him in ambushing Hopkins. Hopkins is viciously beaten by Marshall, who forces a \"confession\" out of the bloodied man. Marshall partially drowns Hopkins (whose thumbs have been tied to his feet), then finally hangs him. Tenser had previously expressed concerns regarding the scope of the Battle of Naseby sequence as well as the gypsy-ending, as these scenes would both require the employment of additional groups of extras. He asked Reeves and Baker to remove the battle sequence and simplify the ending for the final draft.{{sfn|Halligan|2003|p=124}}<ref name=\"Kelley2\">{{cite magazine |last=Kelley |first=Bill |title=Filming Reeves' Masterpiece: ''Witchfinder General'' |magazine=[[Cinefantastique]] |volume=22 |issue=1 |date=August 1991 |pages=39\u201345 |url=https://archive.org/details/cinefantastique_1970-2002/Cinefantastique%20Vol%2022%20No%201%20%28Aug%201991%29/page/n38/mode/1up}}</ref>\n\n=== Casting ===\nPrice was not Michael Reeves's choice to play Hopkins; this was the veteran horror star's 75th film and his 17th for American International Pictures. Some of the performances he provided for his previous AIP movies had elements of [[camp (style)|campy]] [[overacting]], but in ''Witchfinder'' he was subtle and deadly serious. The role was a great challenge for Price, as his frequent clashes with Reeves left him unsure as to what the director wanted. Despite this, Price felt he delivered \"one of the best performances I've ever given\".<ref name=\"hollywoodgothique.com\">{{cite web |url=http://www.hollywoodgothique.com/witchfindergeneral68.html |title=''Witchfinder General'': A Brilliant, Brutal Mini-Masterpiece of Historical Horror |last=Biodrowski |first=Steve |date=2005 |access-date=30 May 2006 |website=Hollywood Gothique |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060613225628/http://www.hollywoodgothique.com/witchfindergeneral68.html |archive-date=13 June 2006 |url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nOgilvy had been a friend of Reeves since they were teenagers, and the actor had appeared in many of the director's amateur short films. Ogilvy had also starred in both of Reeves's two previous feature films, ''[[The She Beast]]'' and ''The Sorcerers'', and was the natural first choice for the role of ''Witchfinder''{{'}}s heroic lead. Describing his working relationship with Reeves, Ogilvy observed that \"his mastery of the technical aspects was absolute\", but added \"Mike never directed the actors. He always said he knew nothing about acting, and preferred to leave it up to us.\" Ogilvy enjoyed working with Price, finding him to be \"very funny, in a 'queeny' sort of way.\"{{sfn|Halligan|2003|p=139}}\n\n''Witchfinder'' was Dwyer's debut feature film. With three years of television work behind her, she had been noticed by Tenser and put under contract with Tigon. She felt Reeves was \"just wonderful&nbsp;\u2026 He was really inspiring to work with. And because it was my first film I didn't know how lucky I was.\" At 21, she found appearing in the love and rape scenes \"stressful\". She would go on to make several more horror films for AIP, most of them co-starring Price, before retiring from acting in the late 1970s.<ref name=\"Halligan\">{{cite book |last=Halligan |first=Benjamin |title=Michael Reeves |publisher=Manchester University Press |year=2003 |isbn=0-7190-6351-5}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Actor Rupert Davies in 1966.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Photo of Rupert Davies|Rupert Davies in 1966]]\nAppearing as Dwyer's uncle, ''Witchfinder'' was only one of several horror films the British [[character actor]] [[Rupert Davies]] found himself in during the later stage of his career. Davies was not pleased when he discovered that the filming of his torture scenes was to be augmented with actual live rats placed on his body. The actor recalled Reeves instructing him, \"Don't move! Wait until one of them starts nibbling your jaw then you might move your head a little.\"<ref name=\"Halligan\" />\n\nAn often-reported anecdote states that Reeves found Russell's high-pitched voice unsuitable for such a rough character, and had all of his dialogue dubbed by [[Bernard Kay]] (who also played the fisherman). However, Billy Kelley doubts this story, noting that Russell's voice in ''[[Inspector Clouseau (film)|Inspector Clouseau]]'' (1968) is similar to that which appears in ''Witchfinder''.<ref name=\"Cooper\">{{cite book |last= Cooper |first= Ian |title= Witchfinder General |publisher= Columbia University Press |year= 2014 |page= 40}}</ref>\n\n=== Filming ===\nProduction began on 18 September 1967 with a budget of \u00a383,000. AIP contributed \u00a332,000, with \u00a312,000 for Price's expenditures and fees, and \u00a320,000 for production costs. Philip Waddilove, a former BBC radio and record producer, contributed \u00a35,000 in return for associate producer billing.<ref name=\"Kelley\">{{cite magazine |last=Kelley |first=Bill |title=Michael Reeves, Horror's James Dean |magazine=[[Cinefantastique]] |volume=22 |issue=1 |date= August 1991 |pages=32\u201338 |url=https://archive.org/details/cinefantastique_1970-2002/Cinefantastique%20Vol%2022%20No%201%20%28Aug%201991%29/page/n32/mode/1up}}</ref> Although the film would be the biggest-budgeted title in Tigon's history, AIP's costs represented a relatively small expenditure. AIP heads [[Samuel Z. Arkoff]] and [[James H.

Reeves kept it no secret from everyone associated with the production that the American actor was not his choice for the role, and the director's comments had reached the actor back in the US. Reeves refused the courtesy of meeting Price at [[Heathrow Airport]] when he arrived in England, a \"deliberate snub calculated to offend both Price and AIP\".{{sfn|Halligan|2003|p=[https://archive.org/details/michaelreeves0000hall/page/118/mode/2up 118]}} \"Take me to your goddamn young genius\", Price reportedly said to co-producer Philip Waddilove, who greeted the actor at the airport instead of Reeves.<ref name=\"McGee\">{{cite book |last=McGee |first=Mark Thomas |author-link=Mark Thomas McGee |title=Faster and Furiouser: The Revised and Fattened Fable of American International Pictures |publisher=McFarland & Company |year=1996 |isbn=0-7864-0137-0}}</ref> When Price went on location and met Reeves for the first time, the young director told the actor, \"I didn't want you, and I ''still'' don't want you, but I'm stuck with you!\"{{sfn|Halligan|2003|p=[https://archive.org/details/michaelreeves0000hall/page/118/mode/2up 119]}}\n\nAccording to [[Kim Newman]] in his book, ''Nightmare Movies'', when Reeves made a suggestion on the set, Price objected and told the director: \"I've made 87{{sic}} films. What have ''you'' done?\" And Reeves responded: \"I've made three good ones.\"<ref name=\"Newman\">{{cite book |last=Newman |first=Kim |author-link=Kim Newman |title= Nightmare Movies: A Critical Guide to Contemporary Horror Films |publisher=Harmony Books |year=1988 |isbn=0-517-57366-0}}</ref> \"Reeves hated me,\" Price later recalled. \"He didn't want me at all for the part.

He would stop me and say, 'Don't move your head like that.' And I would say, 'Like what? What do you mean?' He'd say, 'There\u2014you're doing it again. Don't do that'.\" Price reportedly became so upset with Reeves that he refused to watch the film's [[dailies]].<ref name=\"McGee\" />\n\nIn one scene, Reeves needed Price to shoot his [[flintlock]] between the ears of the horse he was riding. When Price realised that Reeves had ordered that an actual blank charge was to be used so the weapon's puff of smoke would be visible, he shouted, \"What? You want the gun to go bang between the ears of this fucking nag? How do you think he's going to react?\" However, Reeves insisted and, when the gun went off, the horse reared and sent Price tumbling onto the ground. Price was not hurt but he was extremely angered by the incident.{{sfn|Halligan|2003|p=[https://archive.org/details/michaelreeves0000hall/page/138/mode/2up 138]}}\n\nOn the final day of shooting, Price showed up on the set visibly intoxicated. Reeves seethed to Waddilove, \"He's drunk\u2014how dare he be drunk on my set! I'll kill the bastard.\" Waddilove soon discovered that Reeves planned to inflict painful revenge on the actor. During preparations for Price's violent death scene, the director was overheard instructing Ogilvy to \"really lay into Vincent\" with the stage axe. Although when the scene was filmed Ogilvy indeed responded with blows that were not faked, Waddilove had earlier found some foam padding and fitted Price's costume with it, protecting the actor from any injury.{{sfn|Halligan|2003|p=[https://archive.org/details/michaelreeves0000hall/page/146/mode/2up 147]}}\n\nDespite the tension between the two men during the production, when Price saw the film the following year, he admitted that he finally understood what Reeves had been after and wrote the young director a ten-page letter praising the film. Reeves wrote Price back, \"I knew you would think so.\" Years after Reeves's death, Price said, \"I realised what he wanted was a low-key, very laid-back, menacing performance. He did get it, but I was fighting him almost every step of the way. Had I known what he wanted, I would have cooperated.\"<ref name=\"McGee\" />\n\nIn addition to his difficult relationship with Price, Reeves had to deal with a few production problems during the shooting. On the first day, Price was thrown from his horse and sent back to his hotel to recover. The actor returned to work the following day.<ref name=\"Kelley2\" /> Towards the end of filming, a strike was called when the British technicians union learned the production company was not hiring a large enough crew as required by union rules. After an extra man was hired, the crew resumed working.<ref name=\"Kelley2\" /> On two occasions, Reeves was short of actors. Waddilove replaced an absent actor as a Roundhead officer during Wymark's one-day scene. Waddilove's wife, Susi, played one of the women in the animal enclosure during the witch-burning sequence.<ref name=\"Kelley2\" />\n\nThe film's violent ending deviated from the script due to a continuity problem. In the scene as written, Trooper Swallow was supposed to use both his and Harcourt's flintlock pistols to shoot both Hopkins and Richard dead. However, only Harcourt was depicted in previous scenes as carrying a pistol, and therefore only one person could be shot. When this [[plot hole]] was discovered, Reeves immediately told actor Nicky Henson, \"All right, just shoot Vincent and I'll get Ian to scream and shout and go mad and [[freeze frame shot|freeze frame]] on Hilary Dwyer screaming\".<ref name=\"Fleming\">{{cite journal |last= Fleming |first= John |journal= Hammer's House of Horror Magazine |issue= 1 |edition= US |title= Witchfinder General |pages= 16\u201319}}</ref>\n\nSeveral additional [[nude scenes]] were filmed during the production. Set in a [[pub]] and involving local \"wenches\", the sequences were reportedly solely intended for the film's German release version.<ref name=\"McGee\" /> Reeves refused to take part in the filming of these sequences and they were completed by the crew after the initial versions of the scenes had been shot, with Tigon's Tenser acting as director.{{sfn|Halligan|2003|pp=[https://archive.org/details/michaelreeves0000hall/page/132/mode/2up 132\u2013133]}} According to Waddilove, [[Louis M. Heyward]] appeared at the location only to ensure those additional scenes were filmed.<ref name=\"Kelley\" /> The credits read, \"Additional scenes by Louis M Heyward\". According to Ogilvy, this was an [[in-joke]] because for Reeves, \"additional scenes\" meant \"some prick of a producer putting his oar in and messing up what the director had done\".<ref name=\"Kelley\" />\n\n== Soundtrack ==\n{{Infobox album\n| name         = Witchfinder General\n| type         = soundtrack\n| artist       = [[Paul Ferris (composer)|Paul Ferris]]\n| cover        = blank\n| released     = {{start date|df=yes|2013|11|24}}<ref name=\"Soundtrack\">{{cite web |url=https://www.amazon.com/Witchfinder-General-Original-Picture-Soundtrack/dp/B00H2JAOSU/ref=tmm_msc_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=&sr= |title=Witchfinder General (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack) |publisher=[[Amazon (company)|Amazon]] |access-date=27 May 2019}}</ref>\n| recorded     = [[Olympic Studios]], February 1968\n| genre        = [[Film score]], [[contemporary classical music|contemporary classical]]\n| length       = 50:00\n| label        = [[De Wolfe Music]]\n| producer     = \n}}\n\n''Witchfinder General'''s celebrated [[film score|score]] was composed by Reeves' friend [[Paul Ferris (composer)|Paul Ferris]], who had previously scored ''The Sorcerers'', and acted in the film under the alias \"Morris Jar\" (a reference to his favourite composer, [[Maurice Jarre]]). He drew inspiration from the folk song \"[[Greensleeves]]\" in writing the romantic theme \"Peaceful Interlude\" as a means of evoking its time period, as well as to serve as a counterpoint to the film's violence.<ref name=\"DeWolfe\">{{cite web |url=https://www.dewolfemusic.com/page/witchfinder_general |title=Unleashing Witchfinder General |last=Hamilton |first=John |publisher=[[De Wolfe Music]] |access-date=27 May 2019}}</ref> Film critic [[Tim Lucas]] has compared the score to that of [[Marcello Giombini]]'s music for the [[swashbuckler film]] ''[[Knives of the Avenger]]'' (1966), noting that both films are \"historical melodrama[s] that [function as] metaphorical [[Western (genre)|Westerns]]\".<ref name=\"Lucas2\">{{cite book |last=Lucas |first=Tim |title=Mario Bava: All the Colors of the Dark |publisher=Video Watchdog |year=2007 |isbn=978-0-9633756-1-2|pages=654}}</ref>\n\nFerris' ambitions clashed with Tenser; the composer hoped to have the score performed with traditional [[Elizabethan music|Elizabethan instruments]], a creative choice that Tenser vetoed for budgetary reasons. He instead conducted a 55-piece orchestra with whom he recorded at [[Olympic Studios]] in February 1968; he paid most of the performers' wages with his own money when Tenser refused to sanction additional funds, although he was later reimbursed after Tenser was impressed with his efforts. Ferris sold the publishing and master rights for the soundtrack to [[De Wolfe Music]], who incorporated it into their large library of [[stock music]] and released the score, alongside [[Peter Knight (composer)|Peter Knight]]'s music for the Tigon/AIP film ''[[Curse of the Crimson Altar]]'', on their album ''Strange Location'', credited to the \"London Studio Orchestra\". Many of Ferris' tracks have been utilised in a wide variety of films and TV programmes.

British film censor [[John Trevelyan (censor)|John Trevelyan]] was reportedly a distant cousin of Michael Reeves<ref name=\"hollywoodgothique.com\" /> and accepted the director's good intentions when Reeves explained why he felt it was necessary to include such intense violence in the movie. Trevelyan nonetheless argued, \"The film gave the impression that it was exploiting violence, and in particular, sadism for commercial reasons.\" Consequently, the film was cut extensively by the British Board of Film Censors for its UK release. Nearly two complete minutes of what was described as \"excesses of sadistic brutality\" were removed. Reeves agreed to make some of the initial minor cuts himself, but when additional and more extensive demands were made he adamantly refused to take part in any further editing.<ref name=\"Halligan\" />\n\nTrevelyan claimed that Reeves later wrote him a letter admitting that the cuts were not as harmful as he had expected.<ref name=\"Fleming\" /> No copy of the letter has ever surfaced, and based on several other comments the director subsequently made about how the edits \"ruined the film\", Reeves's biographer Benjamin Halligan believes Trevelyan may have somehow \"misremembered\" the existence of this letter, confusing it with an earlier missive from the director in which he made a plea for the BBFC's leniency.<ref name=\"Halligan\" />\n\n== Themes ==\nIn a piece written for the [[British Film Institute|BFI]] commemorating the 50th anniversary of ''Witchfinder General'''s original release, Adam Scovell identified \"weaponised [[belief]]\"\u2014represented by Hopkins' exploitation of the irrationalities and superstitions of the populace as a means of gaining power and fulfilling his sexual and political ambitions\u2014as the film's primary thematic concern, stating that \"belief doesn't create [his] sword, but it most definitely sharpens it\". He also describes the use of \"[[pastoral]] violence\", whereby the beauty of the English countryside is juxtaposed with acts of extreme violence, notably in the opening scene depicting the hanging of a condemned witch.<ref name=BFIScovell /> Writing for ''Cine Outsider'', Jerry Whyte believes that the film \"brilliantly recreates that sense of [[social collapse]]\" and finds that its commentary not only has merit in critiquing the policies of historical [[witch-hunts]], but would have also resonated with contemporary audiences in the light of [[McCarthyism]] and the [[Vietnam War]].<ref name=CineOutsider />\n\nExpanding on [[Iain Sinclair]]'s assertion that \"The film's success lies in the tension between [Tom] Baker's [[Utopian]] permissiveness, his feel for the country, and Reeves' demonic fatalism\", Whyte concurs with Newman's categorisation of ''Witchfinder'' as an \"English [[Western (genre)|Western]]\",<ref>{{cite AV media|title= Witchfinder General ([[Eurotika!]] The Blood Beast: The Films of Michael Reeves)|type=Blu ray|publisher=Odeon Entertainment|year=2011|time=0:18:17| id =ODNBF001}}</ref> noting Reeves' long-standing love of the genre and the film's parallels to it, including its [[English Civil War|Civil War]] setting, frequent horse-riding sequences, clear distinctions between good and evil, and Marshall's pursuit of revenge against Hopkins. Responding to [[David Pirie]]'s acclamation of the film as \"One of the most personal and mature statements in the history of [[British Cinema]]\", he also considers the film to be one of the few fictionalised portrayals of the English Civil War (of which there are few such works) to feature a serious, positive depiction of the [[New Model Army]] and the [[Good Old Cause]] compared to such films as ''[[Cromwell (film)|Cromwell]]'' (1970) and ''[[To Kill a King]]'' (2003), which he described as \"detached travesties of truth, mere hagiographies of Cromwell, that lack the vim, vision, intensity and invention of Reeves' low-budget, improvised gem\".<ref name=CineOutsider>{{cite web |last= Whyte |first= Jerry| date=19 June 2011| work=Cine Outsider| url=http://www.cineoutsider.com/reviews/bluray/w/witchfinder_general.html|title=Landscape, horror, history| access-date = 8 June 2019}}</ref> In light of the brevity of Reeves' career, Halligan notes that the film suggests a pinnacle in his evolution as a filmmaker, with  ''The She Beast'' representing a straightforward approach to the trappings of the [[horror (genre)|horror genre]], ''The Sorcerers'' acting as an allegorical commentary on cinema itself, and ''Witchfinder'' serving as a work that transcends [[genre fiction]] by using its conventions to create \"something different altogether\".<ref>{{cite AV media|title= Witchfinder General ([[Eurotika!]] The Blood Beast: The Films of Michael Reeves)|type=Blu ray|publisher=Odeon Entertainment|year=2011|time=0:22:40| id =ODNBF001}}</ref>\n\n== Release ==\n=== UK reception ===\nEven the truncated version was met with considerable controversy by UK film critics. [[Dilys Powell]] in ''[[The Sunday Times (UK)|The Sunday Times]]'' complained \"17th-century hanging, burning, raping, screaming, and Vincent Price as England's prize torture-overseer. Peculiarly nauseating\".<ref name=\"Williams\" /> ''[[The Guardian]]'' felt the film was filled with \"gratuitous sadism\".<ref name=\"Fleming\" /> Margaret Hinxman of ''[[The Sunday Telegraph]]'' dismissed it as a \"sadistic extravaganza.\"<ref name=\"Fleming\" />\n\nNonetheless, several critics felt the film was worth accolades. [[John Russell Taylor]] in the London ''[[The Times|Times]] Saturday Review'' said the film \"is quite happily and deliberately a horror film: that is to say, it has no particular pretensions to being anything else&nbsp;\u2026 There is much in it which would win Michael Reeves an important reputation if he were dealing with some more pretentious, but fundamentally no more serious subject&nbsp;\u2026 Mr. Reeves is no longer merely promising. He already has real achievements behind him: not merely good horror films, but good films, period.\"<ref name=\"Williams\" /> ''[[Films and Filming]]'' stated: \"''Witchfinder General'' has no explicit 'message', but it does say something about the springs of despair and it says it forcefully. It is a very frightening film&nbsp;\u2026 Matthew Hopkins is the best of Price's recent performances. ''Witchfinder General'' is emphatically not a horror film; it is, however, a very horrifying one&nbsp;\u2026\"<ref name=\"Williams\" />\n\n''[[The Monthly Film Bulletin]]'' observed: \"Not since ''[[Peeping Tom (1960 film)|Peeping Tom]]'' has a film aroused such an outcry about nastiness and gratuitous violence as this one&nbsp;\u2026 the tone of the film is oddly muted, with torture and death in plenty, but viewed matter-of-factly and without stress&nbsp;\u2026 Throughout the whole film there is a vivid sense of a time out of joint, which comes as much from the stray groups of soldiers who skirmish against unseen attackers in the woods or hang wearily about by the wayside waiting for battle to commence, as from the bloody crimes committed in the name of religion by Matthew Hopkins\".<ref>{{cite magazine |first=Geoff |last=Brown |title=''Witchfinder General'' Review |magazine=[[The Monthly Film Bulletin]] |volume=25 |issue=414 |date=July 1968 |page=100}}</ref>\n\nPlaywright [[Alan Bennett]] was particularly repulsed by ''Witchfinder''. In his regular column in ''[[The Listener (magazine)|The Listener]]'', Bennett explained how he felt horror films should always be \"punctuated by belly laughs\" and attacked Reeves's completely humourless film as \"the most persistently sadistic and morally rotten film I have seen. It was a degrading experience by which I mean it made me feel dirty.\"{{sfn|Halligan|2003|pp=196\u2013197}}\n\nAlthough Reeves was infuriated, his response indicated that he believed Bennett's reaction was proof that his decision to include such extreme violence was the correct approach to the material. In his letter published in ''The Listener'', Reeves commented: \"Surely the most immoral thing in any form of entertainment is the conditioning of the audience to accept and enjoy violence&nbsp;\u2026 Violence is horrible, degrading and sordid. Insofar as one is going to show it on the screen at all, it should be presented as such\u2014and the more people it shocks into sickened recognition of these facts the better. I wish I could have witnessed Mr. Bennett frantically attempting to wash away the 'dirty' feeling my film gave him. It would have been proof of the fact that ''Witchfinder General'' works as intended.\"<ref name=\"Halligan\" />\n\n=== US reception ===\n[[File:TheConquerorWorm1968.jpg|thumb|US [[film poster]], which bore the title ''The Conqueror Worm'' to associate the film with AIP's earlier [[American International Pictures#The Corman-Poe cycle|Corman-Poe cycle]].]]\nAIP heads Arkoff and Nicholson had originally contributed their portion of the budget as a tax write-off, but when they were screened the completed film they were astonished by its quality. Nicholson told Louis Heyward, \"It is one of the best we have gotten from England. Everybody thinks this is about the best production in the Poe series for the past few years\". Arkoff noted that \"Michael Reeves brought out some elements in Vincent that hadn't been seen in a long time. Vincent was more savage in the picture. Michael really brought out the balls in him. I was surprised how terrifying Vincent was in that&nbsp;\u2026 I hadn't expected it\".<ref name=\"Halligan\" />\n\nIn the US, the film was not subject to any [[film censorship in the United States|censorship]] at all, and was released virtually intact to AIP's usual mix of [[Drive-in theater|drive-ins]] and [[grindhouse]]s on a [[Double feature|double bill]] with ''[[The Young, the Evil and the Savage]]'' (1968).<ref name=TCM>{{cite web |last= Stafford |first= Jeff| work=TCM| url=http://www.tcm.com/this-month/article/145618%7C0/The-Conqueror-Worm.html|title=The Conqueror Worm| access-date = 9 June 2019}}</ref> However, in an attempt to link the film with Roger Corman's earlier Edgar Allan Poe series of films, it was retitled ''The Conqueror Worm''. Brief [[prologue]] and [[epilogue]] narrations (by Price) taken from Poe's poem were added to justify the new title. As Danny Peary noted in his ''[[Cult Movies (book)|Cult Movies]]'' book, the film went nearly unnoticed by critics during its US release: \"The few snoozing trade reviewers who saw it treated it as just another entry in AIP's Edgar Allan Poe series&nbsp;\u2026 and gave it such dismal notices that future bookings were scarce\".<ref>{{cite book |last=Peary |first=Danny |author-link=Danny Peary |title=[[Cult Movies (book)|Cult Movies]] |publisher=Delta Books |year=1981 |isbn=0-517-20185-2 |page=55}}</ref>\n\nOf those who did see it, ''Hollywood Citizen News'' was appalled by the film: \"A disgrace to the producers and scripters, and a sad commentary on the art of filmmaking&nbsp;\u2026 a film with such bestial brutality and orgiastic sadism, one wonders how it ever passed customs to be released in this country\".<ref name=\"Williams\" /> The trade journal ''Box Office'' noted that: \"Fans of the horror film will be glad to know that Vincent Price is back to add another portrait to his gallery of arch-fiends&nbsp;\u2026 bathed in the most stomach-churning gore imaginable&nbsp;\u2026\"<ref name=\"Williams\" /> ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' opined that \"Dwyer gives evidence of acting talent, but she and all principals are hampered by Michael Reeves's mediocre script and ordinary direction\".<ref>{{cite news |url=https://variety.com/review/VE1117796427.html?categoryid=31&cs=1&query=The+Conqueror+Worm |title=Witchfinder General |work=Variety |date=1 January 1968}}</ref>\n\nIn a more favourable notice written for ''[[The New York Times]]'', [[Renata Adler]] expressed that the film featured \"any number of attractive young aspiring stars who seem to have been cast&nbsp;\u2026 mainly for their ability to scream.&nbsp;\u2026 Price has a good time as a materialistic witch-hunter and woman-disfigurer and dismemberer\u2026.

[[Robin Wood (critic)|Robin Wood]] wrote that \"''Witchfinder General'' is certainly [Reeves'] most successfully achieved work \u2026 what one is immediately struck by is the assurance and intensity of what is on the screen\u2026  the English countryside is felt as a real presence: it is difficult to think of other films in which it has been used so sensitively and meaningfully.

from [[Alex Cox]], who in his introduction to the film in a 1992 episode of [[BBC2]]'s ''[[Moviedrome]]'', praised Price's performance as being \"untroubled\" by his American accent, but otherwise described the film as a \"fairly routine Price horror film with none of the excessive genius of the Roger Corman/Edgar Allan Poe films\", finding its violence to be \"relatively tame\" compared to the ''[[Friday the 13th (franchise)|Friday the 13th]]'' and ''[[A Nightmare on Elm Street (franchise)|A Nightmare on Elm Street]]'' films.<ref name=Moviedrome>{{cite

that ''Witchfinder General'' \"did fantastic business and kicked off a second wave of Edgar Allan Poe movies\" produced by American International Pictures.<ref name=\"McGee\" /> For example, [[Gordon

one writer calling Russell's film \"the apex of the 'historical' witch-persecution films started by ''Witchfinder General''\".<ref>{{cite

Malcolm Gaskill, [[Fellow]] and former Director of Studies in history at [[Churchill College, Cambridge]], and author of ''Witchfinders: A 17th-Century English Tragedy'',<ref name=\"Gaskill\">{{cite book |last= Gaskill |first= Malcolm |title= Witchfinders: A 17th- Century English Tragedy |publisher= Harvard University Press |year= 2005 |isbn= 0-674-01976-8 |url-access= registration |url= https://archive.org/details/witchfinders00malc }}</ref> critiqued the film for the [[Channel 4]] History website, calling it \"a travesty of historical truth\" while acknowledging that \"there is much to be said in favour of ''Witchfinder General''\u2014but as a film, not as history\". Based purely on its level of historical accuracy, Gaskill gave the film \"3 stars\" on a scale of 0\u201310.<ref name=Gaskill2>{{cite web |last= Gaskill |first= Malcolm| work=Channel 4 History| url=http://www.channel4.com/history/microsites/H/history/e-h/film-witchfindergeneral.html|title=Witchfinder General| access-date = 26 September 2006}}</ref>\n\nGaskill had several complaints regarding the film's \"distortions and flights of fancy\". While Hopkins and his assistant John Stearne really did torture, try and hang John Lowes, the vicar of Brandeston, Gaskill notes that other than those basic facts the film's narrative is \"almost completely fictitious\". In the film, the fictional character of Richard Marshall pursues Hopkins relentlessly to death, but in reality the \"gentry, magistrates and clergy, who undermined his work in print and at law\" were in pursuit of Hopkins throughout his (brief) murderous career, as he was never legally sanctioned to perform his witch-hunting duties. Hopkins was also not axed to death, and instead \"withered away from [[Tuberculosis|consumption]] at his [[Essex]] home in 1647\". Price was 56 when he played Hopkins, but \"the real Hopkins was in his 20s\". According to Gaskill, one of the film's \"most striking errors is its total omission of court cases: witches are simply tortured, then hanged from the nearest tree\".<ref name=\"Gaskill2\" />\n\n== Home video versions ==\nCensorship and musical rights issues kept a complete, pristine version of ''Witchfinder General'' from being released on [[videotape]], [[LaserDisc]] or [[DVD]] for many years. Although uncensored theatrical prints have been available for archival showings in the US for several years, video releases of the title were repeatedly compromised.\n\nThe \"Export Version\", which contained both the previously cut violence and alternative shots of topless nudity filmed for overseas release, was passed uncut by the BBFC in 1995, and released on [[VHS]] by Redemption. In 2001, a DVD was released in the UK by Metrodome consisting of two versions, the complete \"Director's Cut\" containing the two minutes of previously censored violence, and the aforementioned \"Export Version\", also with the violence intact but including shots of nudity added to certain sequences. In both versions, the two minutes of violence have been taken from what has been described as \"a grainy VHS source\".<ref name=Swindoll>{{cite web | author=Swindoll, Jeff| work=DVD Savant| url=https://www.dvdtalk.com/dvdsavant/s354witch.html|title=Matthew Hopkins: Witchfinder General| access-date = 26 September 2006}}</ref> Some critics complained that watching the film in this manner was an often \"jarring\"<ref name=\"Swindoll\" /> or \"distracting\"<ref name=Jane>{{cite web | author=Jane, Ian| work=DVD Maniacs | url=http://www.dvdmaniacs.net/Reviews/U-Z/witchfinder_general.html|title=Witchfinder General| access-date = 26 September 2006|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20060905184731/http://www.dvdmaniacs.net/Reviews/U-Z/witchfinder_general.html |archive-date = 5 September 2006|url-status=dead}}</ref> viewing experience. In addition, the soundtrack of the newly inserted nude shots had \"brief snippets of audio repeating itself because of the timing involved in inserting the previously cut footage\".<ref name=\"Jane\" />\n\nIn the US, while censorship of the film has never been a factor, the film nonetheless experienced numerous delays in appearing on home video in its originally intended form. When [[Orion Pictures]] acquired the rights to many of AIP's titles in the 1980s, they were unwilling to also purchase rights to the musical soundtracks of some of the films, and added synthesizer scores by composer Kendall Schmidt in lieu of the original music; ''Witchfinder General'' was one of these \"problem\" titles.<ref name=\"Lucas\">{{cite book |last= Lucas |first= Tim |title= The Video Watchdog Book |publisher= [[Video Watchdog]] |year= 1992 |isbn= 0-9633756-0-1}}</ref> [[Tim Lucas]] has expressed vocal disapproval of Schmidt's rescoring, describing it as a \"betrayal to every effort the original film made to remain true to its time frame\" and \"the most abominable offense ever perpetuated by a home video company\".<ref name=\"Lucas2\" /><ref name=Lucas3>{{cite web | author=Lucas, Tim| year=2007| work=Video WatchBlog| url=http://videowatchdog.blogspot.com/2007/09/witchfinder-general-in-stores-tomorrow.html?m=1|title=Witchfinder General in Stores Tomorrow| access-date = 28 May 2019}}</ref> For years, Ferris's original score was not available in the US on home video releases, although it was included on theatrical and syndicated television prints. The [[HBO]] videotape release from the late 1980s used the Orion version, which also included the nude inserts. Lucas has noted that the spoken soundtrack to these newly added \"spicy\" shots \"doesn't match it correctly\".<ref name=\"Lucas\" />\n\nIn 2005, writer Steve Biodrowski reported that a \"definitive version\" of the film had been restored and would be released in the US on DVD by [[MGM]]-[[United Artists|UA]] in August of that year, as part of their Midnite Movies series.<ref name=\"hollywoodgothique.com\" /> After [[Sony]] purchased the rights to the MGM film library, James Owsley (Director of Restorations at MGM) advised Philip Waddilove (one of ''Witchfinder General''{{'}}s producers) that the date of the DVD release was postponed until October 2006. In an interview conducted in August 2005, Waddilove revealed that he had learned Sony had \"little interest\" in the film and no official announcement of any pending DVD release had ever been made. Waddilove noted that \"the principal at Sony doesn't greenlight DVDs of anything older than ten years!\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hometheaterforum.com/htf/showthread.php?t=233057|title=Sony says 'No' to 'Witchfinder General' DVD, Midnite Movies in Serious Trouble! |last=Reis|first=George|access-date = 19 July 2006|publisher=Home Theater Forum |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20070526195504/http://www.hometheaterforum.com/htf/showthread.php?t=233057 |archive-date= 26 May 2007}}</ref> However, the film was indeed released under the Midnite Movies banner on 11 September 2007 by [[20th Century Fox Home Entertainment]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://classic-horror.com/newsreel/midnite_movie_dvd_covers_galore|title=Midnite Movie DVD Covers Galore!\n|last=Yapp|first=Nate|access-date = 11 September 2007|publisher=Classic Horror}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dvddrive-in.com/|title=MGM Roars Again! |access-date = 7 June 2007|publisher=DVD Drive-In}}</ref> The release includes the complete, uncut version of the film with the Ferris score intact.
