Written by Kie\u015blowski and [[Krzysztof Piesiewicz]], the film explores the themes of identity, love, and human intuition through the characters of Weronika, a Polish choir soprano, and her double, V\u00e9ronique, a French music teacher. The two women do not know each other, and yet they share a mysterious and emotional bond that transcends language and geography.\n\n''The Double Life of V\u00e9ronique'' was Kie\u015blowski's first film to be produced partly outside his native Poland.<ref name=\"criterion\">{{cite web|title=The Double Life of V\u00e9ronique |publisher=Criterion |url=http://www.criterion.com/films/214 |access-date=11 January 2012}}</ref> It won the [[Prize of the Ecumenical Jury]] and the [[FIPRESCI Prize]] at the [[1991 Cannes Film Festival]], and the [[Best Actress Award (Cannes Film Festival)|Best Actress Award]] for Jacob.<ref name=\"cannes\">{{cite web|title=La Double vie de Veronique |publisher=Festival de Cannes |url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/83/year/1991.html |access-date=11 January 2012}}</ref> ''The Double Life of V\u00e9ronique'' was selected as the Polish entry for the [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film|Best Foreign Language Film]] at the [[64th Academy Awards]], but was not accepted as a nominee.<ref>Margaret Herrick Library, Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n{{long plot|section|date=September 2020}}\nIn Poland in 1968, a little girl is shown the stars in the winter sky. In France, a little girl is shown one of the first leaves of spring.\n\nIn 1990, a young Polish woman named Weronika ([[Ir\u00e8ne Jacob]]) is singing at an outdoor concert with her choir when a sudden downpour causes the singers to rush for cover. After Weronika holds the last note alone, she meets her boyfriend, Antek (Jerzy Gudejko), and they go to his apartment to make love. The next day she asks her father to tell Antek she is leaving to be with her sick aunt in [[Krak\u00f3w]]. Mentioning that lately she feels that she is not alone in the world.\n\nWeronika travels to Krak\u00f3w by train and meets up with her aunt, she later contacts a local friend who she meets up at her choir practice. As the choir rehearses, Weronika accompanies them in her soprano voice off-stage. Afterwards, the musical director asks her to audition. Overjoyed, Weronika rushes home with the sheet music. While walking through a square in the midst of a protest, Weronika notices a French tourist taking photos of the protestors\u2014a young woman who looks exactly like her. Weronika smiles as she watches her double board the tourist bus that soon pulls away.\n\nAt the audition, Weronika's singing impresses the musical director and conductor, and she is later told that she won the audition. While heading home after the audition, Weronika suffers a mild cardiac arrest but she recovers. The next day, Weronika reunites with Antek. That night during the concert, while singing a solo part, Weronika collapses onstage and dies of a heart attack.\n\nIn [[Clermont-Ferrand]], France that same day, V\u00e9ronique (Ir\u00e8ne Jacob), a young French woman and Weronika's double, becomes overwhelmed with grief after having sex with her boyfriend. She later goes to her music teacher, telling him she's quitting the choir. The next day, at the school where she teaches music, V\u00e9ronique attends a [[marionette]] performance with her class about a ballet dancer who breaks her leg and then turns into a butterfly. She then leads her class in a musical piece by an eighteenth-century composer, Van den Budenmayer\u2014the same piece performed by Weronika when she died. That night while driving home, she sees the puppeteer at a traffic light motioning to her not to light the wrong end of her cigarette. Later she is awakened by a phone call with no one speaking, only a choir singing the music of Van den Budenmayer. V\u00e9ronique visits her father the next day, where she reveals she is in love with someone she doesn't know, and that recently she felt that she lost someone from her life. Back in Clermont Ferrand, she receives a package containing a shoelace, which she compares to her [[EKG]] graph, and a stranger shines light on her using a mirror.\n\nV\u00e9ronique learns that the puppeteer is a children's book author named Alexandre Fabbri ([[Philippe Volter]]), who based the marionette on one of his books and has written another about a shoelace. In the coming days, V\u00e9ronique reads several of Alexandre's books. When V\u00e9ronique visits her father, he gives her a package addressed to her containing a cassette tape. She listens to the tape, which contains the recordings of a typewriter, footsteps, a door opening, a train station, and a fragment of music by Van den Budenmayer. There are also sounds of a car accident and explosion. The postage stamp on the envelope leads V\u00e9ronique to the [[Gare Saint-Lazare]] train station in Paris. She goes to a cafe in the station where she believes the recordings were made, and sees Alexandre. He tells her he's been waiting for her for two days, that he's working on a new book, and that he sent her the packages as  a kind of experiment to see if she would come to him. Angered at being manipulated, V\u00e9ronique leaves and checks into a nearby hotel. She runs into Alexandre, who asks for her forgiveness, and she brings him up to her room, where they both fall asleep. During the night, they confess their feelings for each other.\n\nThe next morning, while talking to Alexandre, V\u00e9ronique says that she feels that \"I was here and somewhere else at the same time\" and that someone has been guiding her life. V\u00e9ronique proceeds to show Alexandre the contents of her handbag, and he comes across a proof sheet of photos taken on V\u00e9ronique's recent trip to Poland. Alexandre notices what he thinks is a photo of V\u00e9ronique, but she assures him it is not her. She then sees the picture, realizing that it was Weronika in the picture. V\u00e9ronique is overwhelmed and breaks down crying as Alexandre comforts her. It becomes clear that Weronika's fate has somehow compelled V\u00e9ronique to stop singing and avoid the same death.\n\nSome time later at his apartment, V\u00e9ronique sees Alexandre working on a new marionette with her image. When asked about the purpose of a second identical marionette, Alexandre explains that he needs an additional puppet in case one becomes damaged. He shows her how to work the one marionette while the double lies lifeless on the table. Alexandre reads his new book to V\u00e9ronique about two women, born the same day in different cities, who have a mysterious connection. Later that day, V\u00e9ronique arrives at her father's house, stops at the front gate, and reaches out and touches an old tree trunk. Her father, who is inside the house, seems to sense her presence.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast list|\n* [[Ir\u00e8ne Jacob]] as Weronika, and V\u00e9ronique{{#tag:ref|Ir\u00e8ne Jacob's voice was overdubbed by Anna Gornostaj for the Polish dialogue.|group=Note}}\n* Halina Gryglaszewska as The aunt\n* [[Kalina J\u0119drusik]] as The Gaudy Woman\n* [[Aleksander Bardini]] as The Orchestra Conductor\n* W\u0142adys\u0142aw Kowalski as Weronika's father\n* [[Guillaume De Tonqu\u00e9dec]] as Serge\n* Jerzy Gudejko as Antek\n* [[Philippe Volter]] as Alexandre Fabbri\n* [[Sandrine Dumas]] as Catherine\n* Janusz Sterninski as The lawyer\n* Louis Ducreux as The professor\n* Claude Duneton as V\u00e9ronique's father\n* Lorraine Evanoff as Claude\n* Gilles Gaston-Dreyfus as Jean-Pierre\n* [[Chantal Neuwirth]] as The receptionist\n* Alain Fr\u00e9rot as The postman\n* Youssef Hamid as The railroader\n* Thierry de Carbonni\u00e8res as The teacher\n* Nausicaa Rampony as Nicole\n* Boguslawa Schubert as The woman in the hat\n* Jacques Potin as The Man in the gray coat<ref name=\"imdbcast\">{{cite web|title=Full cast and crew for The Double Life of Veronique |website=Internet Movie Database |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0101765/fullcredits#cast |access-date=11 February 2012}}</ref><ref name=\"allmovie\"/>\n}}\n\n==Production==\n===Filming style===\nThe film has a strong metaphysical element, though the supernatural aspect of the story is never explained. Like the later ''[[Three Colours: Blue]]'', it showcased Preisner's musical score as a major plot element, crediting his work to the fictional [[Van den Budenmayer]]. The [[cinematography]] is highly stylized, using color and camera filters to create an ethereal atmosphere; the cinematographer, [[S\u0142awomir Idziak]], had previously experimented with these techniques in one episode of ''[[Dekalog]]'', and Kie\u015blowski would later use colour for a wider range of effects in his ''[[Three Colours|Three Colours trilogy]]''. Kie\u015blowski had earlier used the idea of exploring different paths in life for the same person, in his Polish film ''Przypadek'' (''Blind Chance''), and the central choice faced by Weronika/V\u00e9ronique is based on a brief subplot in the ninth episode of ''Dekalog''.\n\n===Filming locations===\nThe film was shot at locations including [[Clermont-Ferrand]], [[Krak\u00f3w]] and [[Paris]].<ref name=\"imdblocations\">{{cite web|title=Filming locations for The Double Life of Veronique |website=Internet Movie Database |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0101765/locations |access-date=11 February 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Alternative ending===\nA [[Criterion Collection]] region 1 DVD was released in November 2006 in the United States and Canada, which includes an alternative ending which Kie\u015blowski changed in the edit at the request of [[Harvey Weinstein]] of Miramax for the American release. Kie\u015blowski added four brief shots to the end of the film showing V\u00e9ronique's father emerging from the house and V\u00e9ronique running across the yard to embrace him. The final image of the father and daughter embracing is shot from inside the house through a window.\n\n==Music==\nThe film was scored by Zbigniew Preisner. In the film his music is described as being by Van den Budenmayer, a fictitious 18th-century Dutch composer created by Preisner and Kie\u015blowski for attributions in screenplays. Music \"by\" the Dutch composer plays a role in two other Kie\u015blowski films: ''Dekalog'' (1988), and ''Three Colours: Blue'' (1993) in which a theme from his ''musique funebres'' is quoted in the ''Song for the Unification of Europe''. Its E minor soprano solo is prefigured in Weronika's final performance.<ref name=\"musicolog\">{{cite web|title=Zbigniew Preisner |publisher=Musicolog |url=http://www.musicolog.com/preisner.asp |access-date=12 February 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Puppetry==\nThe puppet acts in ''The Double Life of V\u00e9ronique'' were performed by American puppeteer and sculptor [[Bruce Schwartz]]. Unlike most puppeteers who usually hide their hands in gloves or use strings or sticks, Schwartz shows his hands while performing.\n\n==Reception==\n===Critical response===\n''The Double Life of Veronique'' received mostly positive reviews. In her review in ''Not Coming to a Theater Near You'', Jenny Jediny wrote, \"In many ways, ''The Double Life of Veronique'' is a small miracle of cinema; ... Kieslowski\u2019s strong, if largely post-mortem reputation among the art house audience has elevated a film that makes little to no sense on paper, while its emotional tone strikes a singular\u2014perhaps perfect\u2014key.\"<ref name=\"not\">{{cite web|last=Jediny |first=Jenny |title=The Double Life of V\u00e9ronique |publisher=Not Coming to a Theater Near You |url=http://www.notcoming.com/reviews/2xveronique/ |access-date=11 January 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn his review in ''[[The Washington Post]]'', Hal Hinson called the film \"a mesmerizing poetic work composed in an eerie minor key.\" Noting that the effect on the viewer is subtle but very real, Hinson concluded, \"The film takes us completely into its world, and in doing so, it leaves us with the impression that our own world, once we return to it, is far richer and portentous than we had imagined.\" Hinson was particularly impressed with Jacob's performance:\n{{blockquote|This is an actress with an uncanny openness and vulnerability to the camera. She's beautiful, but in a completely unconventional way, and she has such changeable features that our interest is never exhausted. What's remarkable about her performance is how quiet it is; as an actress, she seems to work almost off the decibel scale. And yet she is remarkably alive on screen, remarkably present.

The film suggests mysterious connections of personality and emotion, but it was never meant to yield any neat, summary idea about the two women's lives.\"<ref name=\"nytimes\">{{cite news|last=James |first=Caryn |title=The Double Life of Veronique (1991) |url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/14460/The-Double-Life-of-Veronique/overview |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071113010053/http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/14460/The-Double-Life-of-Veronique/overview |url-status=dead |archive-date=13 November 2007 |department=Movies & TV Dept. |work=[[The New York Times]] |publisher=[[Baseline (database)|Baseline]] & [[All Movie Guide]] |date=2007 |access-date=11 January 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn his review in the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'', Roger Ebert wrote, \"The movie has a hypnotic effect. We are drawn into the character, not kept at arm's length with a plot.\" Ebert singled out S\u0142awomir Idziak's innovative use of color and cinematography:\n{{blockquote|This is one of the most beautiful films I've seen. The cinematographer, Slawomir Idziak, finds a glow in Irene Jacob's pre-Raphaelite beauty. He uses a rich palette, including insistent reds and greens that don't \"stand\" for anything but have the effect of underlining the other colors. The other color, blending with both, is golden yellow, and then there are the skin tones. Jacob, who was 24 when the film was made, has a flawless complexion that the camera lingers near to.
