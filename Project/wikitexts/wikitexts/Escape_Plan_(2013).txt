The film is the first installment of the [[Escape Plan (film series)|''Escape Plan'' film series]].\n\nThe film was released in the United States on October 18, 2013, received mixed reviews and grossed $137 million worldwide against a $54 million budget.\n\n==Plot==\n{{Long plot|date=October 2021}}\nFormer [[prosecutor]] Ray Breslin is the founder and co-owner of Breslin-Clark, a security firm specializing in testing the security measures of [[supermax prison]]s. Posing as an inmate to study facilities from within and exploit their weaknesses to escape, Breslin is driven by the murders of his wife and child by an escaped convict he had successfully prosecuted, and has garnered a reputation as the man who can [[Escapology|escape any prison]].\n\nBreslin and his business partner, Lester Clark, receive a multimillion-dollar deal from [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] operative Jessica Miller to test a new, [[top secret]] prison for [[Forced disappearance|disappeared person]]s on the condition that Ray and his team cannot know the prison's true location. Although this violates his principles, Breslin agrees, allowing himself to be captured under the identity of a terrorist-for-hire. The plan goes awry when his captors remove a tracking microchip he had implanted in his arm and drug him, preventing his colleagues from knowing where he has been taken.\n\nBreslin wakes up inside the prison and realizes that the [[Prison warden|warden]], Hobbes, is not the same warden who was supposed to release him in an emergency. He befriends another inmate, Emil Rottmayer, who claims to be a security expert for Victor Mannheim, a faceless [[Robin Hood]]-type figure who steals from the wealthy. In order to be intentionally subjected to [[solitary confinement]], Breslin and Rottmayer stage a fight. Breslin quickly learns the cell in question is intended to disorient and dehydrate prisoners with high-powered lights. Realizing the cell floors have [[rivet]]s of [[steel]] instead of more secure [[aluminium]], Breslin has Rottmayer acquire a metal plate from Hobbes's office floor, before they and an inmate named Javed are again consigned to solitary cells.\n\nUsing the metal plate, Breslin focuses the reflection from the lights onto the steel rivets, heating them so that they loosen when the steel expands. Following a passageway below the floor, he discovers the prison is inside a massive [[cargo ship]] somewhere in the middle of an ocean. Breslin and Rottmayer continue to study the complex and learn the guards' routines. However, Hobbes then reveals to Breslin that he is aware of his ''true'' identity, has assigned his head of security Drake to monitor him at all times, and will ensure Breslin spends the rest of his life in the prison. Breslin offers Hobbes information on Mannheim from Rottmayer in exchange for his release; Hobbes agrees.\n\nWhile Breslin feeds Hobbes false information about Mannheim, his colleagues, Abigail Ross and Hush, grow suspicious of Clark when Breslin's paycheck for the job is frozen. Hush discovers that the prison, codenamed \"The Tomb,\" is owned by a for-profit organization linked to a notorious [[private security contractor]]. Clark is also revealed to be in contact with Hobbes about Breslin's imprisonment.\n\nRottmayer has Javed convince Hobbes that he is double-crossing them, and Javed is rewarded by being allowed to go above deck for his nightly prayer; this allows him to use a makeshift [[sextant]] to determine the ship's precise [[latitude]]. From this, Breslin and Rottmayer deduce they are somewhere in the [[Atlantic Ocean]] near [[Morocco]]. Breslin convinces the prison physician, Dr. Kyrie (who is also a prisoner), to help him and Rottmayer escape by sending an email to Mannheim, and transmits a false [[tap code]] message from his cell, convincing Hobbes that a riot will occur in Cell Block C. However, Javed instigates ''another'' riot at Cell Block A, allowing him, Breslin, and Rottmayer to flee to the top deck while a lockdown is initiated. Breslin kills Drake when he tries to stop them, but Javed is gunned down by Hobbes and his men. Breslin goes to the [[engine room]] to shut down the Tomb's electrical grid, giving Rottmayer time to open the deck hatch while a helicopter sent by Mannheim engages in a gunfight with the guards. Rottmayer boards the helicopter while Breslin is flushed to the bottom of the ship by the automated water system after Hobbes reboots the grid. Reaching the helicopter as Hobbes fires at him, Breslin shoots several leaking oil barrels, killing Hobbes in the explosion.\n\nThe helicopter lands on a Moroccan beach, where Rottmayer reveals he is actually Mannheim and \"Jessica Miller\" is in fact his daughter, who actually hired Breslin to mastermind her father's escape. Later, Ross informs Breslin that they discovered Clark was offered a $5 million salary to become CEO of the Tomb's security company, should Breslin's imprisonment prove the ship was indeed escape-proof. Hush explains that he tracked Clark to [[Miami]] and locked him in a car, which is in turn placed within a shipping container bound for an unknown destination.\n\n==Cast==\n<!-- Roles as listed in the film credits -->\n<!-- Billed before closing title cards -->\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Sylvester Stallone]] as Ray Breslin / Anthony Portos, a former prosecutor, businessman and skilled [[structural engineer]] who is best known for being the world's best escape artist.\n* [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] as Emil Rottmayer / Victor X.
