It is based on the 1966 [[Sweet Charity|stage musical of the same name]] &ndash; also directed and choreographed by Fosse &ndash; which in turn is based on [[Federico Fellini]], [[Ennio Flaiano]] and [[Tullio Pinelli]]'s screenplay for Fellini's film ''[[Nights of Cabiria]]'' (''Le Notti di Cabiria'', 1957). Whereas Fellini's film concerns the romantic ups-and-downs of an ever-hopeful prostitute, the musical makes the central character a [[taxi dancer|dancer-for-hire]] at a Times Square dance-hall.\n\nThe film has costumes by [[Edith Head]].\n\n==Plot==\nCharity Hope Valentine works as a [[taxi dancer]] along with her friends, Nickie and Helene. She longs for love, but has bad luck with men, first seen when her married boyfriend, Charlie, pushes her off [[List of arches and bridges in Central Park#Former structures|Gapstow Bridge]] in [[Central Park]] and steals her life savings of $427.  The Fandango Ballroom and its sleazily erotic setting are introduced by the song \"Hey, Big Spender\".  Charity shares her disappointment and hopes with her co-workers Nickie and Helene in several scenes throughout the film.\n\nSomewhat later, Charity meets famous movie star Vittorio Vitale, just as he breaks up with his girlfriend Ursula. Charity goes to a nightclub, where the guests perform the \"Rich Man's Frug,\" and later has dinner with Vittorio at his apartment.  When Vittorio leaves the room momentarily, Charity celebrates what seems to be her good fortune with the song \"If They Could See Me Now\". Right after, however, Ursula comes back to Vittorio, and Charity is forced to spend a humiliating night in a closet while Vittorio and Ursula make love and sleep together.  Charity again returns to the Fandango, where she, Nickie, and Helene commiserate on the building's rooftop with \"There's Got to Be Something Better Than This\".\n\nLooking for a more respectable and rewarding line of work, Charity goes to an employment agency, but she is forced to admit that she has no special skills and has to leave when she admits her status.  In the building's elevator, though, Charity meets shy and claustrophobic Oscar Lindquist, and the two are attracted to each other when the elevator halts, trapping them together for hours.  The two go out together several times, including a visit to an alternative church presided over by a preacher named Big Daddy and \"worshiping\" with the song \"The Rhythm of Life\".\n\nAlthough Charity has not told her background to the reserved and respectable Oscar, he proposes marriage and professes to be broadminded when she does finally tell him. Charity's hopes are once again lifted, celebrated in the huge production number \"I'm a Brass Band\".  Oscar meets Charity's friends at the Fandango when they throw a party for her. However at the marriage license bureau Oscar tells her that he has tried to accept her past but is unable to go through with the marriage.\n\nCharity returns to the bridge in Central Park where she first appeared in the film and seems ready to throw herself off it, but a passing group of young [[hippie]]s singing about love and peace hand her a flower, lifting her spirits.\n\n===Alternate ending===\nAn alternate ending, included on the Laserdisc, DVD and Blu-ray releases, picks up after Oscar leaves Charity. Oscar starts to go crazy in his apartment and, feeling suffocated, goes for a walk in the park. He sees Charity on their bridge in Central Park and thinks she is going to jump. Racing to rescue her, he trips and falls in the water. Charity jumps in after him, but can't swim so Oscar rescues her. Oscar realizes Charity is the only breath of fresh air in his life, proposes again, and she accepts. Fosse thought the ending was too corny, but filmed it anticipating that the studio would demand a happy ending. In the end, they agreed with Fosse and kept the original ending from the stage version.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Sweet Charity (1969) trailer 2.jpg|thumb|270px|{{center|[[Paula Kelly (actress)|Paula Kelly]] (third from right) and [[Chita Rivera]] (second from right) as dance hostess girls performing \"[[Big Spender]]\".}}]]\n[[File:John McMartin-Shirley MacLaine in Sweet Charity trailer.jpg|thumb|270px|{{center|[[John McMartin]] and [[Shirley MacLaine]] }}]]\n<!--- Cast and order per tombstone opening credits, roles per closing credits scroll --->\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Shirley MacLaine]] as Charity\n* [[John McMartin]] as Oscar\n* [[Chita Rivera]] as Nickie\n* [[Paula Kelly (actress)|Paula Kelly]] as Helene\n* [[Stubby Kaye]] as Herman\n* [[Barbara Bouchet]] as Ursula\n* [[Ricardo Montalb\u00e1n]] as Vittorio\n* [[Sammy Davis Jr.]] as Big Daddy\n* [[Alan Hewitt]] as Nicholsby\n* [[Dante DiPaolo|Dante D'Paulo]] as Charlie\n}}\n\n==Musical numbers==\n# \"My Personal Property\" *\n# \"[[Big Spender]]\"\n# \"The Pompeii Club\"\n# \"Rich Man's Frug\"\n# \"[[If My Friends Could See Me Now]]\"\n# \"The Hustle\"\n# \"There's Got to Be Something Better Than This\"\n# \"It's a Nice Face\" *\n# \"The Rhythm of Life\"\n# \"Sweet Charity\"\n# \"I'm a Brass Band\"\n# \"I Love to Cry at Weddings\"\n# \"Where Am I Going?\"\n\n<nowiki>*</nowiki> New song written for the film\n\n===Charts===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Chart (1970)\n!Position\n|-\n|Australia ([[Kent Music Report]])<ref name=aus>{{cite book|last=Kent|first=David|author-link=David Kent (historian)|title=Australian Chart Book 1970\u20131992|edition=illustrated|publisher=Australian Chart Book|location=St Ives, N.S.W.|year=1993|isbn=0-646-11917-6|page=281}}</ref>\n|align=\"center\"|13\n|}\n\n== Production ==\nShirley MacLaine, a friend of Fosse and his wife and partner [[Gwen Verdon]], had suggested the adaptation to [[Lew Wasserman]], the head of [[Universal Pictures]].  Verdon, who had starred as Charity in Fosse's original Broadway musical, had wanted to play the lead again but endorsed MacLaine to star in the film since she was a recognizable movie star.{{citation needed|date=May 2021}} Verdon did contribute to the film, without credit, as the assistant choreographer.  [[Chita Rivera]] and [[Paula Kelly (actress)|Paula Kelly]], who had appeared in a London stage production of the play, have supporting roles in the film.  [[John McMartin]] was the only lead actor from the Broadway version to reprise his role.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Miller|first=Frank|date=January 26, 2005|title=Sweet Charity|url=https://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/92067/sweet-charity#articles-reviews?articleId=87919|access-date=December 7, 2020|website=Turner Classic Movies}}</ref>\n\nDuring production, Fosse had conflicts with his original producer, [[Ross Hunter]], who was replaced by [[Robert Arthur (film producer)|Robert Arthur]].  [[I. A. L. Diamond|I.A.L.

While some praised Fosse's innovative approaches to the staging of some numbers and Shirley MacLaine's performance, others found it overlong, most of the songs ineffective, and the storyline ineffectively engaging. Reviewers familiar with the stage version were especially critical.  [[Vincent Canby]] in the [[The New York Times|New York Times]] was especially harsh, disparaging the film as \"so enlarged and so inflated that it has become another maximal movie: a long, noisy and, finally, dim imitation of its source material,\" and complaining that although MacLaine \"often looks like Miss Verdon, she never succeeds in re-creating the eccentric line that gave cohesion to the original\".<ref>{{Cite web|last=Canby|first=Vincent|date=April 2, 1969|title=Screen: A Blow-Up of 'Sweet Charity'|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1969/04/02/archives/screen-a-blowup-of-sweet-charity.html|access-date=December 7, 2020|website=New York Times}}</ref> The film has been reappraised over the years and has been reviewed positively. ''Sweet Charity'' has an 83% \"Fresh\" rating on [[Review aggregator|review aggregation]] site [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on 6 reviews, with an average rating of 6.40/10.<ref>{{rotten-tomatoes|sweet_charity|Sweet Charity}} Accessed December 24, 2020.</ref>\n\n===Box office===\nThe actual cost of the film's production has been disputed, amidst conflicting accounts by Universal Pictures, reports in ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'', and claims by Fosse himself, but estimates range from more than $20 million to just $8 million. Regardless of the actual cost, the film's returns were a huge disappointment for the studio. By January 1970, the film had made only $1.1 million, just a bit more than the cost of Shirley MacLaine's salary.<ref name=\":0\" /> By 1976, according to ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'', the film earned rentals of $4,025,000 in the US and Canada.<ref>\"All-time Film Rental Champs\", ''Variety'', 7 January 1976 p 50</ref>\n\n===Accolades===\nThe film was screened at the [[1969 Cannes Film Festival]], but outside of the main competition.<ref name=\"festival-cannes.com\">{{cite web |url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/2516/year/1969.html |title=Festival de Cannes: Sweet Charity |access-date=2009-04-10|work=festival-cannes.com}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n!
