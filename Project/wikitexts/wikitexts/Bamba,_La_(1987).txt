His family is poor, and he works as a [[farmworker]] after school. He loves music, especially rock and roll, and dreams of becoming a famous musician. Richie suffers from [[Fear of flying|aviophobia]] due to recurring nightmares about the [[1957 Pacoima mid-air collision|mid-air collision]] that occurred directly over his school, in which his best friend was crushed to death by the fallen aircraft, an event he did not witness due to attending his grandfather's funeral. One day, Richie's troubled half-brother Bob Morales arrives after being released from jail, surprising him and his mother. They all decide to leave the farm and move to a house in Southern California, along with Bob's girlfriend, Rosie.\n\nThree months later, Richie attends [[San Fernando High School]] where he falls in love with fellow student Donna Ludwig, and joins his friend Chino's band, The Silhouettes. Bob becomes an alcoholic and starts to abuse Rosie, shouting at her and raping her. When he learns that Rosie is pregnant, he refuses to take responsibility. Richie invites Donna to a garage party where he and the Silhouettes are performing. At the party, Richie performs on his guitar, but he doesn't get his turn to sing and Donna does not attend.\n\nRichie decides to host another party and becomes The Silhouettes\u2019 new leader after they vote out their original leader. However, a drunken Bob crashes the party and starts a brawl among the attendees. The next day, [[Bob Keane]], the owner and president of [[Del-Fi Records]] in [[Hollywood, Los Angeles|Hollywood]], auditions Richie after seeing him perform at the party and signs him to his label; Keane becomes his record producer and manager. Richie and Donna become a couple, despite Donna's father disapproving of his daughter dating a [[Hispanic]] boy, and Richie starts recording songs like \"[[We Belong Together (Robert & Johnny song)|We Belong Together]]\" and \"[[Come On, Let's Go]]\" at [[Gold Star Studios]]. Keane gives Richie his professional name of \"Ritchie Valens\", which Richie dislikes at first, but eventually accepts it. Ritchie starts releasing his songs on the radio and becomes an overnight sensation.\n\nDespite his increasing fame, Ritchie's relationship with Donna suffers with her father refusing to let Ritchie see her. He then gets the inspiration to write the song \"[[Donna (Ritchie Valens song)|Donna]]\", as a tribute to her. One night, Bob meets up with Ritchie, and they go to [[Tijuana|Tijuana, Mexico]]. At a brothel, Ritchie sees a band performing the Mexican folk song \"La Bamba\". He awakens the next day in a small village and is given a talisman by an old man called El Curandero to protect him from his fear of flying. Ritchie and Bob return home to discover that Rosie gave birth to a girl in their absence. Ritchie soon decides to make a rock and roll rendition of \"La Bamba\" as a single to go along with \"Donna\" and convinces Keane to release it.\n\nAt first, Ritchie avoids flying to his concerts and appearances, but eventually conquers his fear when invited to perform his song \"Donna\" on ''[[American Bandstand]]'' in Philadelphia. Keane helps him by giving him a little vodka to calm his nerves during the flight. Bob soon becomes jealous of Ritchie's success and drinks excessively while screaming and shouting at his family, wanting to see his daughter. Ritchie buys his family a brand new house and goes to [[New York City]] to perform at Alan Freed's 1st Anniversary Rock 'n' Roll Show at the [[Brooklyn Paramount Theater]], meeting [[Eddie Cochran]] and [[Jackie Wilson]] backstage. He then goes onstage to perform \"La Bamba\" to the crowd's adoration. Arriving home for Christmas, he is given a welcoming party by his family and friends, but Bob is resentful and later starts a fight with Ritchie, breaking his talisman in the process. Ritchie promises Donna that he will always love her and hopes that one day they will get married.\n\nRitchie later joins the [[The Day the Music Died|Winter Dance Party]] tour with [[Buddy Holly]] ([[Marshall Crenshaw]]) and [[The Big Bopper]] after \"La Bamba\" and \"Donna\" reach the top of the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' charts. While performing in [[Clear Lake, Iowa]], at the [[Surf Ballroom]], the tour bus' heating system breaks down, so Holly charters an airplane to fly to their next stop in [[Moorhead, Minnesota]]. Valens, Holly, and the Big Bopper take off in the airplane during a snowstorm on February 2, 1959. Before the flight, Ritchie makes a call to his brother, wherein they resolve their differences. He invites Bob to fly out to Chicago to join the tour for family support, which Bob accepts.\n\nThe next day, as Bob is fixing his mother's car, he hears on the radio that his brother's airplane crashed, killing everyone on board. Bob darts out of his driveway in an attempt to get to his mother before she hears the news, but is too late. The news hits the Valenzuela family, Bob Keane, and Donna very hard. After Ritchie's funeral procession at the [[San Fernando Mission Cemetery]], Bob walks across a bridge and screams out Ritchie's name, remembering all the good times they had together.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Lou Diamond Phillips]] as [[Ritchie Valens]]\n* [[Esai Morales]] as Roberto \"Bob\" Morales (Ritchie's half-brother)\n* [[Rosanna DeSoto]] as Connie Valenzuela (Ritchie's mother)\n* [[Elizabeth Pe\u00f1a]] as Rosie Morales\n* [[Danielle von Zerneck]] as Donna Ludwig\n* [[Joe Pantoliano]] as [[Bob Keane]]\n* [[Rick Dees]] as [[Ted Quillin]]\n* [[Stephen Lee (actor)|Stephen Lee]] as [[The Big Bopper]]\n* [[Sam Anderson]] as Mr. Ludwig (Donna's father)\n\nAlso featured are several members of the Valenzuela family and director Luis Valdez's family, including:\n* Concepcion Valenzuela (the real Connie Valenzuela, Ritchie's mother) as the older woman sitting next to Ritchie at a family party\n* [[Daniel Valdez]] (Luis' younger brother) as Ritchie's Uncle Lelo\n\n[[Brian Setzer]] has a cameo as [[Eddie Cochran]] performing \"Summertime Blues\" onstage, while [[Howard Huntsberry]] plays [[Jackie Wilson]] singing \"Lonely Teardrops\" onstage.
