J. Bowen]], [[Joe Swanberg]], [[Barbara Crampton]] and [[Rob Moran]]. The plot concerns an estranged family under attack by a group of masked assailants during a family reunion.\n\nThe film had its world premiere at the [[2011 Toronto International Film Festival]] Midnight Madness program<ref name=\"YoureNext-r1\"/><ref name=\"YoureNext-r2\"/> and was theatrically released on August 23, 2013, in the United States. The film grossed over $26 million from a $1 million production budget and has since gained a [[cult following]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://moviepilot.com/p/youre-next-writer-talks-about-cancelled-sequel/4098702|title='You're Next' Writer Spills Sequel Secrets|website=[[Moviepilot]]|publisher=Alex Aronson|access-date=January 7, 2017|archive-date=January 8, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170108094145/https://moviepilot.com/p/youre-next-writer-talks-about-cancelled-sequel/4098702|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Please see [[WP:FILMPLOT]] before expanding the plot.  It recommends plot summaries be between 400 and 700 words. -->\nThe film opens with a couple, Talia and Erik Harson, having sex. Afterwards, Talia walks around the house, not noticing that the motion sensor light outside had turned out. After a shower, Erik finds \"you're next\" written on the window in Talia's blood; her body is lying dead on the ground. An attacker wearing a lamb mask attacks Erik and kills him with a machete.\n\nErin accompanies her boyfriend, Crispin Davison, to his family reunion at their vacation home in rural [[Missouri]]. Present are Crispin's parents Aubrey and Paul, Crispin's older brother Drake and his wife Kelly, Crispin's younger siblings Felix and Aimee, and their partners, Zee and Tariq, respectively.\n\nDuring dinner, someone shoots crossbow bolts through the window, one of which hits Tariq in the head and kills him, with another wounding Drake. The survivors discover that their [[Mobile phone signal|cell phone reception]] has been jammed. Aimee runs outside for help but runs into a [[Garrote|garrote wire]] which slices her throat, killing her. Erin is briefly attacked by an attacker in a tiger mask in the kitchen, but she fights him off as he escapes through the kitchen door. Paul puts Aubrey to bed, but an intruder wearing a fox mask, who was hiding under the bed, murders Aubrey with a machete, leaving the words \"you're next\" in blood on the wall.\n\nKelly discovers Fox Mask, panics and flees the house, going to Erik's house nearby. Upon discovering Erik's corpse, Lamb Mask throws her through the window and kills her by driving an ax into the side of her head. Crispin leaves the house to look for help. Tiger Mask attacks Erin with an ax but she crushes his skull by beating him with a meat tenderizer.\n\nPaul finds sleeping bags and food wrappers that indicate the killers have been staying in the house for some time. He finds Felix and Zee and starts to explain it to them, only for Fox Mask to slit his throat with a machete. It is then revealed that Felix and Zee hired the assassins to murder the family so they could collect their inheritance. Lamb Mask finds Tiger Mask's corpse and flips the dinner table over in rage. He discovers a wounded Drake hiding, but retreats after Erin stabs him with a screwdriver. Erin sets up nail traps by the house's entrances, explaining to Zee that she grew up in a [[Survivalism|survivalist]] compound where she learned combat and survival skills. Felix meets Drake in the basement and kills him out of pity by stabbing him with multiple screwdrivers.\n\nOn the upper floor, Erin comes across Paul's body. She jumps through a window to escape Fox Mask, injuring her leg. Lamb Mask is injured by one of her nail traps. While hiding, Erin overhears an argument between Felix, Zee, Fox Mask, and Lamb Mask where it was revealed that Lamb Mask and Tiger Mask were brothers. Her cell phone beeps to indicate that her text to 911 has gone through, alerting the killers. She is able to ambush and kill Lamb Mask by stabbing him in the head.\n\nRealizing she cannot outrun Fox Mask with a wounded leg, Erin sets a trap at the front door where an ax would fall and kill anyone who opened the door. Fox Mask enters through a window, so Erin lures him into the basement, where she blinds him with a camera before cracking his skull with a log, killing him. Zee and Felix attempt to kill Erin themselves, but she kills Felix by shredding the top of his head with a blender before stabbing Zee in the top of the head with a knife. Felix's cell phone rings and Erin answers without speaking. Believing he is speaking to Felix, Crispin reveals his involvement in the scheme. Erin confronts him when he returns, and Crispin explains that she was never meant to be targeted. After he attempts to bribe her into staying quiet, she kills him in disgust by stabbing him in the neck and eye.\n\nA police officer arrives and shoots Erin in the shoulder, having seen her kill Crispin. After calling for backup, he attempts to enter the house and falls victim to Erin's front door trap, with the axe hitting him in the head just as the movie cuts to a blood splattered \"You're next\".\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Sharni Vinson]] as Erin\n* [[Nicholas Tucci]] as Felix Davison\n* [[Wendy Glenn]] as Zee\n* [[A.
