It stars [[Cindy Crawford]] as [[family law]] attorney Kate McQuean and [[William Baldwin]] as police officer Max Kirkpatrick. Kirkpatrick ends up on the run to protect McQuean when she is targeted for murder by ex-members of the [[KGB]] with interests in a ship owned by a Cuban man who may lose it in a divorce case being pursued by McQuean. Written by [[Charlie Fletcher]], ''Fair Game'' is based on [[Paula Gosling]]'s 1974 novel ''A Running Duck'', which was previously adapted into the 1986 film ''[[Cobra (1986 film)|Cobra]]''.\n\nLocations used for the film included [[Coral Gables, Florida]], [[Miami Beach, Florida|Miami Beach]], and the [[Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary]].\n\n''Fair Game'' was panned by critics and was a [[box office bomb]], recouping only $11 million of its $50 million budget.\n\n==Plot==\n\nKathryn \"Kate\" McQuean ([[Cindy Crawford]]) is a Miami lawyer who, in the course of a divorce proceeding, attempts to seize a 157-foot freighter docked off the Florida coast in lieu of unpaid alimony.\n\nThe freighter, which is owned by criminal Emilio Juantorena ([[Miguel Sandoval]]), is the current base of operations of Ilya Pavel Kazak ([[Steven Berkoff]]), a former KGB agent who has become an international money laundering expert, and has also become the leader of a group of rogue KGB members, including Stefan ([[Gustav Vintas]]), Leonide \"Hacker\" Volkov ([[Paul Dillon]]), Navigator (Marc Macaulay), Rosa ([[Jenette Goldstein]]) and Zhukov ([[Olek Krupa]]).\n\nWhen Kate is unintentionally hit by a stray bullet, Miami detective Max Kirkpatrick ([[William Baldwin]]) is assigned to the case. Then an attempt is made on Kate's life by Kazak, who \u2014 after killing Juantorena \u2014 assembles his team into tracking and killing Kate; Max then becomes her protector.\n\nKate, Max, and two of his colleagues stay at a hotel. They order pizza, but Volkov traces the order, and Rosa and two henchmen infiltrate the hotel and kill Max's colleagues. Max manages to kill the whole hit squad (except Rosa) and he and Kate then leave. After Max contacts his superior, Lt. Meyerson ([[Christopher McDonald]]), FBI agents are sent to escort them. The \"agents\" turn out to be henchmen working for Kazak, and Max's partner and long-time friend Detective Louis Aragon ([[John Bedford Lloyd]]) is killed in the process. After killing some of Kazak's men, Max and Kate travel throughout Florida, trying to avoid Kazak and find out why he wants Kate dead.\n\nHowever, their jeep breaks down on a freeway and they call a tow truck to come pick them up. Volkov and Stefan show up to kill them, while Kazak splits from them to deal with Max's cousin, who has been feeding them information regarding Kazak and his past activities in Cuba. Kate and Max are forced to run with the tow truck while their jeep is still hooked onto it. After a long chase and gunfight, Kate steps hard on the brakes while Max steers the wheel of the truck, unhooking their car and causing it to crash into Volkov's and Stefan's SUV, killing both of them.\n\nOne of Kate's clients is the ex-wife of Emilio Juantorena, and she is trying to repossess the boat to pay for her divorce settlement. She stumbled on something about the ship and is the main reason why Kazak and his crew put a target on Kate.\n\nRegardless, after having passionate sex with Max aboard a train car, Kate is kidnapped by Kazak and taken to the freighter while Rosa and Zhukov are sent to kill Max. They accidentally kill the Navigator and Max shoots both of them. Rosa, however, has a bulletproof vest on, and Max only kills her after a long fight. Max then boards the freighter in an attempt to rescue Kate. Max and Kate blow up the freighter, killing Kazak. They jump off of the boat just in time to watch it blow up and sink. They climb aboard the boat Max used to reach the freighter and start to kiss passionately. As the sun sets they ride off together.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[William Baldwin]] as Max Kirkpatrick, a Miami police detective\n* [[Cindy Crawford]] as Kate McQuean, a civil-law lawyer who becomes a target for murder\n* [[Steven Berkoff]] as Colonel Ilya Pavel Kazak, a rogue ex-KGB operative now heads a group of terrorists\n* [[Christopher McDonald]] as Lieutenant Meyerson, Max's boss\n* [[Miguel Sandoval]] as Emilio Juantorena, the owner of the freighter where Kazak's base of operations is at\n* [[Johann Carlo]] as Jodi Kirkpatrick, Max's cousin who is a forensics specialist\n* [[Salma Hayek]] as Rita, Max's ex-girlfriend\n* [[John Bedford Lloyd]] as Detective Louis Aragon, Max's partner\n* Frank Medrano as Detective Graybera\n* Don Yesso as Detective Beanpole\n* [[Jenette Goldstein]] as Rosa, Kazak's brutal henchwoman\n* [[Paul Dillon]] as Leonid 'The Hacker' Volkov, one of Kazak's henchmen\n* [[Olek Krupa]] as Zhukov, Kazak's henchman\n* Gustav Vintas as Stefan, one of Kazak's henchmen\n* [[Marc Macaulay]] as Navigator, one of Kazak's henchmen\n* [[Kane Hodder]] as One of Kazak's henchmen on train\n* [[Antoni Corone]] as Codebreaker, one of Kazak's henchmen\n* Sonny Carl Davis as Fake FBI Agent Baker, one of Kazak's henchmen\n* [[Scott Michael Campbell]] as Adam, salesman at computer store\n* [[Dan Hedaya]] as Walter Hollenbach (uncredited), Juantorena's attorney<ref>{{cite web |date=10 August 1995 |last=Archerd |first=Army |title='Clueless' Hedaya plays 'Game' |url=https://variety.com/1995/voices/columns/clueless-hedaya-plays-game-1117862752/ |website=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] }}</ref>\n\n==Production==\n{{unreferenced section|date=May 2019}}\nIn 1993 Sylvester Stallone was attached to the project.<ref>{{cite web |date=1 June 1993 |last=Moerk |first=Christian |title=Silver signs Stallone for 'Game' |url=https://variety.com/1993/film/news/silver-signs-stallone-for-game-107327/ |website=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] }}</ref> [[Geena Davis]], [[Julianne Moore]] and [[Brooke Shields]] were all offered the role of Kate McQuean, but they all passed as they were busy with other projects, before supermodel [[Cindy Crawford]] was ultimately cast.\n\nInitially, ''Fair Game'' ran for 95 minutes, but after re-edits and reshoots, the film came in four minutes shorter. After poor test screenings, [[Warner Bros.]] cut some scenes and reshot others. In the original version, [[Elizabeth Pe\u00f1a]] played the role of Rita, Max's ex-girlfriend, hence her name was included on the poster and the trailer. But when test audiences thought that Pena didn't seem right for the role, she was fired and [[Salma Hayek]] was brought in to replace her; Hayek said she took the part because she was allowed to rewrite the scenes she was in. Crawford and [[William Baldwin]] also shot additional scenes to help boost the relationship between their characters. Crawford also shot more scenes on her own in order to develop her character. [[Dan Hedaya]] had a bigger part in the original cut, but it was shortened to one scene and so he chose to go uncredited. The extra filming/additions and re-edit caused the film to be delayed by three months.\n\nThe theatrical trailer shows some deleted and alternate scenes cut from the original movie before it was partially re-shot and re-edited. For example, in the alternate interrogation scene, Kirkpatrick asks McQuean who's trying to kill her to which she responds that no one's trying to kill her. Also in an extended part of this scene, McQuean asks Kirkpatrick if he has problem with lawyers; he answers that he's a cop\u2014that it's \"written on the badge\". There is also alternate dialogue between the two while they're driving in which he says that they can't trust the cops and when she asks him why she should trust him he says because he hasn't shot her, adding that the \"night's still young\". In an additional scene, he gives her a gun, she says she doesn't know how to shoot, but he says it's like taking a picture: just point and shoot. In another added scene, Kirkpatrick asks McQuean if she'll hit him\u2014she says \"night's still young\", his line in the deleted scene from the trailer.\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Box office===\n''Fair Game'' is considered to be a [[box office bomb]], grossing only US$11.5 million against production budget of $50 million.<ref>{{cite news |date=1995-11-13 |author=Richard Natale |title= Ace Cashes In With $40.3-Million Opening : Movies: It's five box office smashes in a row for Jim Carrey as his new comedy is reported to be attracting a diverse audience. |work= [[Los Angeles Times]] |url= http://articles.latimes.com/1995-11-13/entertainment/ca-2664_1_jim-carrey |access-date=2021-02-02 }}</ref>\n\n===Critical response===\n''Fair Game'' was panned by critics.
