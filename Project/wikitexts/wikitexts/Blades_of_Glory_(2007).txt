Nelson]]. It tells the story of a mismatched pair of banned [[Figure skating|figure skaters]] who become teammates upon discovering a loophole that will allow them to compete in the sport again. The film's story was conceived by [[Busy Philipps]], who \"fleshed out the screenplay\".<ref name=\"vulture.com\">{{cite web |last1=Ivie |first1=Devon |title=Busy Philipps Was 'Gaslit' Into Thinking She Didn't Actually Dream Up Blades of Glory |url=https://www.vulture.com/2018/11/busy-philipps-talks-trauma-of-her-blades-of-glory-credit.html |website=New York mag |date=18 November 2018 |access-date=18 November 2018}}</ref> However, co-writers Jeff and Craig Cox dropped her name from the script.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Kile |first1=Meredith |title=13 of Busy Philipps' Best Celeb Stories From 'This Will Only Hurt a Little' |url=https://www.etonline.com/13-of-busy-philipps-best-celeb-stories-from-this-will-only-hurt-a-little-111604 |website=ET |access-date=18 November 2018}}</ref> The film was produced by [[DreamWorks Pictures]], [[MTV Films]], [[Red Hour Productions|Red Hour]], and Smart Entertainment and released on March 30, 2007, by [[Paramount Pictures]]. The film was met with positive reviews.\n\n==Plot==\nChazz Michael Michaels is a skillful [[Single skating|single skater]] but raunchy [[Sexual addiction|sex addict]]. Jimmy MacElroy is an equally talented and [[Effeminacy|effeminate]] but sheltered skater. From the start, the two rival skaters are clear polar opposites with different backgrounds. Chazz grew up on the streets and is a self-taught skater, while Jimmy was adopted by Darren MacElroy, a wealthy man who adopts children showing exceptional athletic ability.\n\nAt the 2002 World Winter Sport Games, Chazz and Jimmy tie for gold as Darren fires Jimmy's coach Darren Goddard over this. While standing on the awards podium after both skaters tie for gold, the two have an argument that escalates into a fight and ends with the World Games mascot being accidentally set on fire. As a result, Commissioner Ebbers of the National Figure Skating Association, despite their best defenses (Jimmy profusely and genuinely apologizing for his role, Chazz merely defending himself by picking up a sports magazine that declared, as did he, that \"Chazz Michael Michaels ''IS'' ice skating\"), strips both men of their medals and bans them from competitive skating for life. Darren immediately \"[[Disownment|unadopts]]\" Jimmy.\n\nThree and a half years later, both men have grudgingly taken on alternative occupations. Jimmy is working at a sporting goods store while Chazz performs on a children's [[ice show]] until he is fired for being drunk on the job and forcing a performance to be scrapped midway through when he puked first in his costume, then on the ice itself. Jimmy's obsessive stalker Hector tells him of a loophole in the ban which only bans him from men's single skating, allowing him to compete in [[pair skating]]. In hopes of entering the upcoming World Winter Sport Games, Jimmy contacts Coach Goddard. Jimmy's search for a last-minute partner leads him to Chazz, but the two men start a fight at the ice show which gets them both arrested. Coach Goddard visits them in jail in order to convince them to skate as the first-ever male-male pairs team.\n\nCoach Goddard informs them that to win, they will need to learn to get along and pull off a move that has never been performed successfully: the \"Iron Lotus\", an extremely complicated and dangerous maneuver that he had developed years ago. The only attempt of the maneuver was in [[North Korea]], and resulted in the man [[decapitating]] the woman with his skate blade. Nonetheless, they practice the maneuver as Coach Goddard is convinced that two males would be better suited to successfully perform the move. Over time, Chazz and Jimmy become friends.\n\nMeanwhile, brother and sister competitors Stranz and Fairchild Van Waldenberg, who are worried that their spot as the top team is threatened when Jimmy and Chazz perform well at the Winter Sports Games qualifiers, command their younger sister Katie Van Waldenberg to disrupt the duo by going out with Jimmy and then having sex with Chazz. When Katie falls in love with Jimmy after going on a date with him, her elder siblings threaten to harm him if she does not comply. Katie gets Chazz's attention after attending a sex addicts' meeting as the newest member, then invites Chazz to her room and tries to seduce him. Chazz refuses out of respect for Jimmy, delighting Katie, but cannot resist grabbing her breasts. Jimmy witnesses this and is outraged at their betrayals. Chazz attempts numerous times to apologize to Jimmy by voicemail.\n\nIn an attempt to sabotage the performance the following day, Stranz and Fairchild kidnap both Chazz and Jimmy, but both are able to escape. As Fairchild kidnapped Jimmy, she revealed to him that she and her brother commanded Katie to have sex with Chazz to make him jealous, and that he did not go through with it out of respect for him. Chazz and Jimmy arrive at the ice rink just in time to compete, where they reconcile quickly and begin their routine. Fairchild, seeing the two doing well, breaks her pearl necklace and throws a pearl onto the ice; Chazz skates over it and breaks his ankle, rendering him unable to perform his role in the Iron Lotus. Jimmy then offers to switch places with him. Although they have never practiced the other's roles, they perform it perfectly, and win the competition.\n\nJimmy reconciles with Katie, and the two pursue a relationship. Stranz and Fairchild are arrested for the foul play and desecrating a Canadian mascot. They begin arguing, then kissing each other [[incest]]uously before being handcuffed by the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]]. Jimmy and Chazz receive the gold medal and fly off into the sky via rockets on their skates.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast list|\n* [[Will Ferrell]] as Chazz Michael Michaels, a professional skater.

However, in an oral history about the movie for [[Nerdist]], Craig Cox fully attributed the idea of ''Blades of Glory'' to his brother, Jeff Cox. The oral history has since been updated with information about Philipps' contributions.<ref name=\"vulture.com\"/> Phillips discussed the incident in her memoir, ''This Will Only Hurt A Little'', stating that she should be credited as a co-writer in the credits and that she had registered the idea with the [[Writers Guild of America West]] at its inception, having come up with the concept{{snd}}even suggesting Ferrell as one of the two co-leads (alongside [[Ben Stiller]]){{snd}}while she and then-boyfriend Craig were watching television together when he visited her in [[Vancouver]], during production of ''[[White Chicks]]''.<ref>{{cite book |first=Busy |last=Philipps |author-link=Busy Philipps |date=2018 |title=This Will Only Hurt a Little |location=Toronto |publisher=Touchstone |pages=192\u2013197 |isbn=978-1-5011-8471-0}}</ref> [[Seth Rogen]] has also said that he and his writing partner [[Evan Goldberg]] wrote a draft of the screenplay that included some of the \"biggest jokes\" featured in the finished movie, but they were ultimately fired and did not receive any credit.<ref>{{cite podcast |url=https://omny.fm/shows/dead-eyes/09-neighbors-pals |title=Dead Eyes: Neighbors & Pals |publisher=Headgum |host=Connor Ratliff |date=June 25, 2020 |time=20:20 |access-date=March 13, 2022}}</ref>\n\nAll of the scenes at the National Figure Skating Championships and World Wintersport Games were shot at the [[Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena]].

[with] an obviousness to the set-ups, a no-nonsense compression, a sometimes clunky transition from one sequence to the next\" but that it was the film's ability to \"venture to fantastically absurd places \u2013 to set aside the rapid and hokey forward movement \u2013 and there to idle in neutral, in zones of pure comic exploration\" and offer \"moments of expansive hilarity ... that made the films worthwhile.\"<ref name=\"The Monthly\">{{cite magazine|url=http://www.themonthly.com.au/film-luke-davies-mind-bottling-will-speck-amp-josh-gordon-s-039blades-glory039-567?page=0%2C1|magazine= [[The Monthly]]|title=\"Mind Bottling: Will Speck & Josh Gordon's \"Blades of Glory\"}}</ref>\n\n==Home media==\nThe film was released on [[DVD]] and [[HD DVD]] on August 7, 2007, and released on [[Blu-ray Disc]] on May 20, 2008.\n\n==References==\n; Citations\n{{Reflist}}\n; General references\n{{Refbegin}}\n* {{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/movies/news/2007-02-04-blades-of-glory_x.htm |title=Heder, Ferrell skate for comedy gold |access-date=February 5, 2007 |last=Breznican |first=Anthony |date=February 5, 2007 |publisher=USA Today}}\n* {{cite web |url=http://news.bostonherald.com/localRegional/view.bg?articleid=187755 |title=Leap into Hollywood: Local skater subs for Will Ferrell in comedy \"Blades of Glory\" |access-date=March 11, 2007 |last=Tolson |first=Shaun |date=March 11, 2007 |publisher=Boston Herald |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070323010820/http://news.bostonherald.com/localRegional/view.bg?articleid=187755 |archive-date=March 23, 2007 }}\n{{Refend}}\n\n==External links==\n{{wikiquote}}\n* {{Allmovie title|341075}}\n* {{IMDb title|0445934}}\n* {{Metacritic film}}\n* {{rotten-tomatoes|blades_of_glory}}\n* {{cite web|url=https://lakeshorerecords.com/bladesofglory/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090105211149/http://www.lakeshore-records.com/bladesofglory/|url-status=dead|archive-date=2009-01-05|title=Blades of Glory Soundtrack|work=Lakeshore Records}}\n\n{{MTV Films}}\n{{Will Speck and Josh Gordon}}\n\n[[Category:2007 films]]\n[[Category:2000s sports comedy films]]\n[[Category:2000s English-language films]]\n[[Category:Figure skating films]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Montreal]]\n[[Category:American buddy films]]\n[[Category:American sports comedy films]]\n[[Category:Incest in film]]\n[[Category:Films set in Colorado]]\n[[Category:DreamWorks Pictures films]]\n[[Category:MTV Films films]]\n[[Category:Paramount Pictures films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Will Speck and Josh Gordon]]\n[[Category:Films produced by Ben Stiller]]\n[[Category:Red Hour Productions films]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Theodore Shapiro]]\n[[Category:2007 directorial debut films]]\n[[Category:2007 comedy films]]\n[[Category:2000s American films]]"}]}}}}
