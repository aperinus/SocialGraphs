It was filmed in London between January and May 1970 and directed by [[Ronald Neame]], and starred [[Albert Finney]] as [[Ebenezer Scrooge]]. The film's score was composed by [[Leslie Bricusse]] and arranged and conducted by [[Ian Fraser (composer)|Ian Fraser]]. With eleven musical arrangements interspersed throughout, the award-winning motion picture is a faithful musical retelling of the original.\n\nThe film was a follow-up to another Dickens musical adaptation, 1968\u2019s award-winning ''[[Oliver! (film)|Oliver!]]''. The posters for ''Scrooge'' included the tagline \"What the dickens have they done to Scrooge?\", designed to head off any criticism of an all-singing, all-dancing old skinflint.<ref name=\"Filming\">{{cite news |title=From Charles Dickens to Michael Caine, here are the five best Scrooges |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/features/best-scrooge-a-christmas-carol-muppets-charles-dickens-michael-caine-a8681446.html |access-date=1 December 2019 |work=The Independent}}</ref> Finney won the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor - Motion Picture Musical or Comedy|Golden Globe Award for Best Actor in a Musical/Comedy]] in 1971. The film received four Academy Award nominations, including for [[Academy Award for Best Original Song|Best Original Song]] for \"Thank You Very Much\".\n\n== Plot ==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 to 700 words only. -->\nOn Christmas Eve 1860, in London, [[Ebenezer Scrooge]], a surly money-lender, does not share the merriment of Christmas. He declines his nephew Harry's invitation for Christmas dinner and reluctantly gives his loyal employee Bob Cratchit Christmas Day off. Cratchit and his children go shopping and prepare for the holiday at home (\"Christmas Children\"). As Scrooge leaves his office, he declines two gentlemen's offer to collect money for charity and visits some of his clients including Tom Jenkins (\"I Hate People\"). As he makes his way home, he is accosted and mocked by street urchins (\"Father Christmas\").\n\nIn his house, Scrooge encounters the ghost of his deceased business partner [[Jacob Marley]], who warns him to repent his wicked ways or he will be condemned in the afterlife as he was, carrying a heavy chain forged by his own selfishness and greed (\"See the Phantoms\"). Before leaving, Marley informs him that three spirits will visit him.\n\nAt one o'clock, Scrooge is visited by the Victorian [[Ghost of Christmas Past]], who takes him back in time to his childhood and early adult life.  They visit his lonely school days, and then his time as an employee under Mr. Fezziwig. Attending a Christmas party held by Fezziwig (\"December the 25th\"), Scrooge falls in love with Fezziwig's daughter, Isabel (\"Happiness\"). However, the spirit shows Scrooge how Isabel left him when he chose money over her (\"You...\"). He dismisses the spirit as he finds himself back in his bed.\n\nAt two o'clock, Scrooge is visited by the [[Ghost of Christmas Present]], a jolly giant who shows him the joys and wonder of [[Christmas|Christmas Day]] (\"I Like Life\"). Scrooge and the spirit visit Bob's house, learning his family is surprisingly content with their small dinner, while Scrooge takes pity on Bob's ill son [[Tiny Tim (A Christmas Carol)|Tiny Tim]]. The spirit comments that Tiny Tim might not survive until next Christmas unless the course of events changes. They next visit Harry's Christmas party, where Harry defends his uncle from his guests' snide remarks. Before the spirit vanishes, Scrooge is warned that life is too short and to do as much as he can in what little time he has.\n\nAt three o'clock, Scrooge is visited by the [[Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come]], a silent, cloaked figure who shows him the next Christmas with Tom and the other citizens rejoicing at the death of Scrooge (\"Thank You Very Much\"), with Scrooge unaware of the reason they are celebrating. The spirit transports Scrooge to Bob's house, where he discovers that Tiny Tim has died. The spirit escorts Scrooge to a cemetery, where the spirit shows Bob mourning at Tim\u2019s grave, then points out Scrooge\u2019s own grave. A horrified Scrooge promises to change his ways before the spirit takes on a [[Grim Reaper]]-esque appearance and causes him to fall through his grave into the caverns of [[Hell]]. Scrooge is met there once again by Marley, who shows him to his ice-cold \"office\" to serve as [[Lucifer]]'s personal clerk. Scrooge is adorned with an enormous chain made from his lifetime of past sins by four masked demons before finding himself back in his bedroom.\n\nFinding it's Christmas Day, a gleeful Scrooge decides to bring happiness to the citizens of London (\"I'll Begin Again\"). He goes on a shopping spree, buying food and presents. He runs into Harry and his wife and gives them some overdue presents as well. They invite Scrooge to Christmas lunch, which he gladly accepts. Dressed as \"Father Christmas,\" Scrooge then delivers a giant turkey, presents and toys to the Cratchits, and after making his identity known, gives Bob a raise and promises that they will work to find the best doctors to make Tiny Tim better. Scrooge then frees all his clients from their debts, much to their delight (\"Thank You Very Much (Reprise)\"). Scrooge returns home to get ready for lunch with his family and thanks Marley for helping him at a second chance at life.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Albert Finney]] as [[Ebenezer Scrooge]]\n* [[Alec Guinness]] as [[Jacob Marley]]\n* [[Edith Evans]] as [[Ghost of Christmas Past]]\n* [[Kenneth More]] as [[Ghost of Christmas Present]]\n* Paddy Stone as [[Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come]]\n* [[David Collings]] as [[Bob Cratchit]]\n* [[Frances Cuka]] as Mrs. Cratchit\n* [[Richard Beaumont (actor)|Richard Beaumont]] as [[Tiny Tim (A Christmas Carol)|Tiny Tim]]\n* [[Michael Medwin]] as Harry, Scrooge's nephew <!-- While his name is Fred in the book and most film versions he is distinctly called Harry at several points in the film -->\n* [[Mary Peach]] as Harry's wife\n* [[Gordon Jackson (actor)|Gordon Jackson]] as Tom, Harry's friend\n* [[Anton Rodgers]] as Tom Jenkins\n* [[Laurence Naismith]] as [[Mr. Fezziwig]]\n* [[Kay Walsh]] as Mrs. Fezziwig\n* [[Suzanne Neve]] as Isabel\n* [[Derek Francis]] as charity gentleman\n* [[Roy Kinnear]] as charity gentleman\n* [[Geoffrey Bayldon]] as Pringle, the toyshop owner\n* [[Molly Weir]] as woman debtor\n* [[Helena Gloag]] as woman debtor\n* Reg Lever as Miller, the puppeteer\n* Karen Scargill as Kathy Cratchit\n* [[Keith Marsh]] as well wisher\n* [[Marianne Stone]] as party guest\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Soundtrack listing==\n# \"Overture\" (removed from current Blu-ray release)\n# \"A Christmas Carol\" \u2013 Chorus\n# \"Christmas Children\" \u2013 David Collings, Richard Beaumont, & Karen Scargill\n# \"I Hate People\" \u2013 Albert Finney\n# \"Father Christmas\" \u2013 Urchins\n# \"See the Phantoms\" \u2013 Alec Guinness\n# \"December the 25th\" \u2013 Laurence Naismith, Kay Walsh & Ensemble\n# \"Happiness\" \u2013 Suzanne Neve\n# \"A Christmas Carol\" (Reprise) \u2013 Chorus\n# \"You....You\" \u2013 Albert Finney\n# \"I Like Life\" \u2013 Kenneth More & Albert Finney\n# \"The Beautiful Day\" \u2013 Richard Beaumont\n# \"Happiness\" (Reprise)\n# \"Thank You Very Much\" \u2013 Anton Rodgers & Ensemble\n# \"I'll Begin Again\" \u2013 Albert Finney\n# \"I Like Life\" (Reprise) \u2013 Albert Finney\n# \"Finale: Father Christmas\" (Reprise) / \"Thank You Very Much\" (Reprise) \u2013 All\n# \"Exit Music\" (Bonus Track, not included on LP)\n\nA soundtrack album containing all the songs from the film was issued on [[Columbia Records]] in 1970.
