It also features [[Maxine Cooper]] and [[Cloris Leachman]] appearing in their feature film debuts. The film follows a private investigator in Los Angeles who becomes embroiled in a complex mystery after picking up a female hitchhiker. The screenplay was written by Aldrich and [[A. I. Bezzerides]], based on the 1952 crime novel ''[[Kiss Me, Deadly]]'' by [[Mickey Spillane]].\n\n''Kiss Me Deadly'' grossed $726,000 in the United States and $226,000 overseas. The film received the condemnation of the [[Kefauver Commission]], which accused it of being \"designed to ruin young viewers\", a verdict that director Aldrich protested. Despite initial critical disapproval, it is considered one of the most important and influential film noirs of all time.\n\nThe film has been noted as a stylistic precursor to the [[French New Wave]], and has been cited as a major influence on a number of filmmakers, including [[Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut]], [[Jean-Luc Godard]], [[Alex Cox]], and [[Quentin Tarantino]]. In 1999, ''Kiss Me Deadly'' was selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.\"<ref>{{Cite web|title=Preserving the Silver Screen (December 1999) - Library of Congress Information Bulletin|url=https://www.loc.gov/loc/lcib/9912/nfb.html|access-date=2020-07-20|website=www.loc.gov}}</ref><ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==Plot==\n[[Mike Hammer (character)|Mike Hammer]] is a tough private investigator who, with the assistance of his associate and lover Velda, typically works on \"penny-ante divorce cases.\" One evening, Hammer is forced to suddenly stop his sports car by Christina, an escapee from a nearby psychiatric hospital, who is running barefoot along the road, wearing nothing but a trench coat. Hammer gives her a ride. Christina asks him, whatever happens, to \"remember me,\" alluding to a poem by [[Christina Rossetti]]. Thugs waylay them, and Hammer hears Christina screaming as she is tortured to death. The thugs then push Hammer's car off a cliff with Christina's body and an unconscious Hammer inside. \n\nHammer comes to in a hospital with Velda hovering over him. He decides to investigate Christina's death, believing that it \"must be connected with something big.\" He retrieves a book of poetry from the dead woman's apartment and reads aloud several lines from Rosetti's poem, \"Remember\", as he tries to figure out what that something might be.\n\nHammer goes to the apartment of Lily Carver, who says she was Christina's roommate. Lily tells Hammer she is in hiding and asks him to protect her. She is after a mysterious box that, she believes, has contents worth a fortune. Hammer later arrives at the lavish mansion of gangster Carl Evello, who also seeks the box. Hammer fends off Charlie Max and Sugar Smallhouse, two of Evello's henchmen, and then confronts Evello, who is initially impressed by Hammer's brazenness and offers to work out a deal, but swiftly retracts the offer.\n\nHammer's friend, Nick the auto mechanic, who helped defuse bombs planted in Hammer's car, is then murdered. Carl's thugs kidnap Hammer and take him to an isolated beach house, where another of their associates, Dr. G. E. Soberin (revealed to be Christina and Nick's murderer), injects him with [[sodium pentothal]] before interrogating him. Hammer slips free of his bonds, kills Carl and Sugar, and escapes. He locates the suspiciously-hot box, which burns his arm, in a locker at the Hollywood Athletic Club, but when he goes to his friend Lieutenant Murphy for help, Murphy warns him off, hinting it has to do with a top-secret government experiment akin to the [[Manhattan Project]]. Hammer goes back to the [[beach house]]. Before he arrives, Lily, now revealed to be an imposter named Gabrielle, is there with Soberin. They have the box, and have Velda locked in a bedroom. Gabrielle shoots Soberin to get the box for herself. With his dying words, Soberin urges the insatiably curious Gabrielle not to open it.\n\nWhen Hammer comes into the room, Gabrielle says \"Kiss me, Mike\" and shoots him. She then opens the box, which emits a blinding light and piercing sound. Gabrielle screams and bursts into flames. Hammer, wounded, struggles to his feet, and looks for Velda. Together, the pair flee the burning house, helping each other along the beach to the ocean as the house explodes behind them and becomes consumed in flames.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Ralph Meeker]] as [[Mike_Hammer_(character)|Mike Hammer]]\n* [[Albert Dekker]] as Dr. G.E.

The stories would be ''[[Kiss Me, Deadly]]'' and ''[[My Gun Is Quick]]''. Saville turned over control to Aldrich because he was busy on ''[[The Silver Chalice (film)|The Silver Chalice]]''.<ref>{{Cite news |title=TRACY AND CLIFT TO STAR IN FILM: Metro Will Team Actors in 'Bannon' Against Background of U. S. Labor Movement |last=Pryors |first=Thomas M.|date=  September 3, 1954 |work=The New York Times}}</ref>\n\nThe screenplay was loosely adapted by [[A. I. Bezzerides]] with contributions from Aldrich, though it \"made no effort to follow the book\u2019s convoluted plot, [though] both are structured around [a] search for a mysterious box.\"{{sfn|Arnold|Miller|1986|p=38}}\n\n====Differences from the novel====\n''Kiss Me Deadly'' departs from other Mike Hammer films in that Hammer never carries a gun. This is explained when Lt. Murphy tells Hammer his PI license and gun permit have been revoked. Although he is held at gunpoint, pistol whipped, and even shot, he complies with the gun ban, relying only on his fists to hammer people into submission or worse.\n\nThe screenplay also departs from Spillane's novel, replacing the mafia conspiracy at the center of the novel with an apparent case of espionage and a mysterious suitcase serving as the film's [[MacGuffin]].\n\nThe film further departs from the book by portraying Hammer not so much as a sleuth of the [[hardboiled]] school than as a sleazy, narcissistic bully, perhaps the darkest private detective in film noir. Much to the derision of the local police, Hammer makes his living mostly by blackmailing adulterers, he or his secretary sometimes seducing and entrapping the targets themselves, a practice perhaps made even worse because Hammer seems to exploit the genuine affection that Velda feels for him in order to get her participation. He also readily resorts to violence, whether he's defending himself against the thugs Evello sends to kill him, breaking a potential informant's treasured record to get him to talk, or roughing up a coroner who has the temerity to demand payment in return for a key that Christina had apparently swallowed before her death. Bezzerides wrote of the script: \"I wrote it fast because I had contempt for it... I tell you Spillane didn't like what I did with his book. I ran into him at a restaurant and, boy, he didn't like me.\"<ref>Bergan, Ronald ''The Guardian'', Obituary, \"A.I. Bezzerides: Screenwriter victim of the Hollywood blacklist, he is renowned for three classic American film noirs,\" February 6, 2007.</ref>\n\n===Los Angeles locations===\n''Kiss Me Deadly'' is a time capsule of Los Angeles, much of it filmed in the downtown neighborhood of [[Bunker Hill, Los Angeles, California|Bunker Hill]].  Many of the locations disappeared in the urban development of the late 1960s, although a few remain.\n\n* The Hill Crest Hotel, NE corner of Third and Olive Streets (Italian opera singer's home)\n* The Donigan 'Castle', a Victorian mansion at 325 S. Bunker Hill Avenue (where Cloris Leachman's character lived, used for interior and exterior shots)\n* Apartment Building, 10401 Wilshire Boulevard, NW corner of Wilshire and Beverly Glen (Hammer's apartment building; still standing)\n* Carl Evello's Mansion, 603 Doheny Road, Beverly Hills, California\n* Clay Street, an alley on Bunker Hill beneath [[Angels Flight]] incline railway (still operating), where Hammer parks his Corvette and then takes the back steps up to the Hill Crest Hotel, although when he approaches the hotel's large porch, he is on the Third Street steps opposite Angels Flight\n* Club Pigalle, 4800 block of Figueroa Avenue (the black jazz nightclub that Hammer frequents)\n* Hollywood Athletic Club, 6525 W. Sunset Blvd. (where Hammer finds the radioactive box; still standing)\n\n==Release==\n===Critical response and analysis===\nCritics have generally viewed the film as a metaphor for the paranoia and fear of nuclear war that prevailed during the [[Cold War]] era.<ref>Prince, Stephen, ''Visions of Empire: Political Imagery in Contemporary American Film'', Praeger/Greenwood, 1992, {{ISBN|0-275-93662-7}}.</ref> \"The great whatsit,\" as Velda refers to the object of Hammer's quest, turns out to be a mysterious valise, hot to the touch because of the dangerous, glowing substance it contains, a metaphor for the atomic bomb. The film has been described as \"the definitive, apocalyptic, nihilistic, science-fiction film noir of all time \u2013 at the close of the classic noir period.\"<ref name=\"filmsite\">{{cite web |url=http://www.filmsite.org/kiss.html |title=Kiss Me Deadly |last=Dirks |first=Tim |work=Filmsite.org}}</ref>\n\nAlthough a leftist at the time of the [[Hollywood blacklist]], Bezzerides denied any conscious intention for this metaphor in his script, saying that \"I was having fun with it.

The gumshoe's subsequent investigation into the woman's death doubles as a lacerating indictment of modern society's dissolution into physical/moral/spiritual degeneracy \u2013 a reversion that ultimately leads to nuclear apocalypse and man's return to the primordial sea \u2013 with the director's knuckle-sandwich cynicism pummeling the genre's romantic fatalism into a bloody pulp.
