Wiest won Best Supporting Actress for her performance, the second time Allen directed her to an Academy Award. It is considered one of Allen's best works.\n\n==Summary==\nIn 1928, David Shayne is an idealistic young [[playwright]] newly arrived on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]]. Desperate to gain [[financing]] for his play, ''God of Our Fathers'', he is convinced by producer Julian Marx to cast actress Olive Neal, the girlfriend of gangster Nick Valenti, in a minor role.\n\nCompensating for his frustration with the demanding and talentless Olive, Shayne is thrilled to cast alcoholic faded star Helen Sinclair in the lead role, along with the dieting British thespian Warner Purcell. Rehearsals are soon thrown into chaos when Olive shows up escorted by Cheech, a mob henchman, who insists on watching rehearsals.\n\nEventually Cheech starts giving notes on the script to Shayne, who is initially angered by the intrusion but quickly realises the ideas are excellent. Cheech, who barely learned to read before burning down his school, has a natural talent for playwriting, but is not interested in taking any credit. The cast members herald the revised script as genius, disparaging his initial draft as dull and pompous.\n\nBuoyed by their imminent success, Shayne and the actors succumb to their vices. His [[Significant other|partner]], Ellen, catches him cheating on her with Helen. Warner indulges in overeating and begins an affair with Olive, which he attempts to break off when Cheech threatens his life. Growing increasingly frustrated with Olive's poor acting, Cheech tries to have her fired from the production. After Shayne reminds him he can't get rid of Olive, Cheech murders her and dumps her body in a river.\n\nOlive's murder is widely assumed to be part of an inter-gang conflict, but Shayne immediately senses the truth and argues with Cheech. Regretting his mistakes, Shayne is dismayed to learn that Ellen is leaving him for his hedonistic Marxist friend Sheldon Flender.\n\nOn opening night, Valenti accuses Cheech of the murder, which he denies. Henchmen Rocco and Aldo chase Cheech backstage while the play is being performed, shooting him. With his dying words, Cheech gives Shayne a new [[Plot twist|final line for the play]]. The play is a critical and commercial hit, but Shayne skips the after party to confront Flender. He confesses his lack of talent and proposes marriage to Ellen, who accepts his newfound desire to leave high society.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=18em}}\n* [[John Cusack]] as David Shayne\n* [[Dianne Wiest]] as Helen Sinclair\n* [[Jennifer Tilly]] as Olive Neal\n* [[Chazz Palminteri]] as Cheech\n* [[Mary-Louise Parker]] as Ellen\n* [[Jack Warden]] as Julian Marx\n* [[Joe Viterelli]] as Nick Valenti\n* [[Rob Reiner]] as Sheldon Flender\n* [[Tracey Ullman]] as Eden Brent\n* [[Jim Broadbent]] as Warner Purcell\n* [[Harvey Fierstein]] as Sid Loomis\n* [[Brian McConnachie]] as Mitch Sabine\n* [[Stacey Nelkin]] as Rita\n* [[Edie Falco]] as Lorna\n* [[Benay Venuta]] as Adoring Theatre Patron\n* [[Debi Mazar]] as Violet\n* [[Ma\u0142gorzata Zaj\u0105czkowska]] as Lili\n* [[Tony Sirico]] as Rocco\n* [[Tony Darrow]] as Aldo\n* [[Shannah Laumeister Stern]] as Movie Theatre Victim\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\nThe film's locales include the duplex co-op on the 22nd floor of 5 [[Tudor City]] Place in [[Manhattan]].<ref>Barbanel, Josh.
