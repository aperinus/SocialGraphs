The [[film adaptation]] was scripted by [[David Koepp]]. It stars [[Al Pacino]], [[Sean Penn]], [[Penelope Ann Miller]], [[Luis Guzm\u00e1n|Luis Guzman]], [[John Leguizamo]], [[Jorge Porcel]], [[Joseph Siravo]], and [[Viggo Mortensen]].\n\nThe film stars Pacino as Carlito Brigante, a [[Nuyorican]] criminal who vows to go straight and to retire in paradise. However, his criminal past proves difficult to escape, and he unwittingly ends up being dragged into the same activities that got him imprisoned in the first place. The film is based mainly on ''After Hours'', but used the title of the first novel to avoid it being confused with [[Martin Scorsese]]'s 1985 film of the [[After Hours (film)|same name]]. This is the second film collaboration between Pacino and De Palma, after 1983's film, ''[[Scarface (1983 film)|Scarface]]''.\n\n''Carlito's Way'' received a positive response from critics, with a lukewarm result at the box office, but has subsequently become a [[cult film]]. Both Penn and Miller received [[Golden Globe]] nominations for their performances. A [[prequel]] titled ''[[Carlito's Way: Rise to Power]]'', based on the first novel, was released [[direct-to-video]] in 2005.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1975 [[New York City|New York]], after having served five years of a 30-year prison sentence, career criminal Carlito Brigante is freed on a legal technicality exploited by his close friend and lawyer, Dave Kleinfeld. Carlito vows to end his unlawful activities but is persuaded to accompany his young cousin Guajiro to a drug deal held at a bar. Guajiro's suppliers betray and kill him, forcing Carlito to shoot his way out. Later, Carlito takes Guajiro's $30,000 from the botched deal and uses it to buy into a [[nightclub]] owned by a gambling addict named Saso, intending to save $75,000 to retire to the [[Caribbean]].\n\nAs nightclub co-owner, Carlito declines several offers for a business partnership with a hot-headed young gangster from [[the Bronx]] named Benny Blanco. Carlito also rekindles his romance with his former girlfriend Gail, a ballet dancer moonlighting as a stripper. Kleinfeld develops a love interest with Benny's girlfriend, Steffie, a waitress at the club. Benny's frustration with Carlito's constant rejections boils over and he confronts Carlito one night at his table. Carlito publicly humiliates Benny, who reacts by manhandling Steffie. Fueled by his now-extensive use of alcohol and [[cocaine]], Kleinfeld brazenly pulls out a gun and threatens to kill Benny, but Carlito intervenes. Despite being personally threatened by Benny himself, Carlito lets him go unharmed, a decision which alienates Carlito's bodyguard Pachanga.\n\nKleinfeld, who stole $1&nbsp;million in payoff money from his client, [[American Mafia|Mafia]] boss Anthony Taglialucci, is coerced into providing his yacht to help Taglialucci break out of the [[Vernon C. Bain Correctional Center|Rikers Island prison barge]]. Kleinfeld begs for Carlito's assistance in the prison break, and Carlito reluctantly agrees. That night, Carlito, Kleinfeld, and Taglialucci's son Frankie sail to a floating buoy outside of the barge where Taglialucci is waiting. As they pull Taglialucci aboard, Kleinfeld kills him and Frankie and dumps their bodies in the [[East River]], claiming that they would have killed him anyway. He then smugly admits to stealing Taglialucci's money. Knowing mob retaliation is imminent, Carlito immediately severs his ties with Kleinfeld and decides to leave town with Gail. The next day, Kleinfeld barely survives a retaliatory assassination attempt at his office.\n\nThe police apprehend Carlito and take him to the office of District Attorney Norwalk, where he is played a tape of Kleinfeld offering to testify to false criminal allegations against Carlito. Norwalk advises that he is aware that Carlito is an accomplice to the Taglialucci murders in an attempt to leverage him into betraying Kleinfeld, but Carlito refuses. In the hospital, Carlito visits Kleinfeld, who confesses to selling him out. Having noticed a suspicious man dressed in a police uniform waiting in the lobby, Carlito secretly unloads Kleinfeld's revolver and leaves. The man is Taglialucci's other son, Vinnie, seeking vengeance for his brother and father. After sending the officer already guarding Kleinfeld away, Vinnie enters Kleinfeld's room and shoots him dead.\n\nCarlito buys train tickets to [[Miami]] for himself and Gail, now pregnant. When he stops by his club to get the stashed money, Carlito is met by a [[East Harlem Purple Gang|group of East Harlem Italian gangsters]] led by Vinnie. The Italians plan to kill Carlito, but he manages to slip out through a secret exit. The Italians pursue him throughout the city's subway system and into [[Grand Central Terminal]], where they engage in a gunfight. Carlito kills all of his pursuers except Vinnie, whom the police shoot and kill. As Carlito runs to catch the train where Gail and Pachanga are waiting for him, Benny ambushes him and fatally shoots him several times with a [[suppressor|silenced gun]]. Pachanga admits to Carlito that he is now working for Benny, but Benny then shoots him dead as well. Carlito hands a tearful Gail the money and tells her to escape with their unborn child and start a new life. Carlito is wheeled away on a gurney to be taken to the hospital. As he dies, Carlito stares at a billboard with a Caribbean beach and a picture of a woman. The billboard then comes to life in his mind, and the woman, now Gail, starts dancing.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Al Pacino]] as Carlito Brigante (called \"Charlie\" by Gail). Pacino came to ''Carlito's Way'' directly from his Oscar-winning role in ''[[Scent of a Woman (1992 film)|Scent of a Woman]]''.<ref name=\"press pack p4\"/> To get into the character, he accompanied Torres through East [[Harlem]] to absorb the sights and atmosphere.<ref name=\"Torres\"/> Pacino first envisioned Carlito with a [[ponytail]], but, after visiting Harlem, he quickly realized such a hairstyle was uncommon among the local men. The beard was Pacino's idea. The black leather coat fit into the period setting.<ref name=\"hot dog p30\"/>\n* [[Sean Penn]] as David Kleinfeld. For the pivotal role of Carlito's sleazy lawyer and best friend, Penn was lured back from early retirement by the challenge of playing the corrupt lawyer. Taking the role meant that he could finance his movie ''[[The Crossing Guard]]'' and work with Pacino.<ref name=\"hot dog p33\"/> De Palma and Penn sat down and discussed what '70s mob lawyers looked like. Penn shaved the hair on the front of his forehead to give the appearance of a receding hairline. He permed the rest.<ref name=\"De Palma\"/> [[Alan Dershowitz]], believing that Penn was attempting to look like him, threatened the filmmakers with a [[defamation]] lawsuit.<ref>{{cite book |title=Sean Penn: His Life and Times |last=Kelly |first=Richard T. |year=2005 |publisher=[[Canongate Books]] |location=Edinburgh, Scotland |page=273 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gBb3v9GZMPQC&q=%22sean+Penn%22%2C+%22Alan+Dershowitz%22+%22carlito%27s+way%22&pg=PA273 |access-date=January 15, 2011 |isbn=9781841957395 |archive-date=September 11, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200911183949/https://books.google.com/books?id=gBb3v9GZMPQC&pg=PA273&lpg=PA273&dq=%22sean+Penn%22,+%22Alan+Dershowitz%22+%22carlito%27s+way%22&hl=en#v=onepage&q=%22sean%20Penn%22%2C%20%22Alan%20Dershowitz%22%20%22carlito%27s%20way%22&f=false |url-status=live}}</ref>\n* [[Penelope Ann Miller]] as Gail. At the time, Miller was 29 years old to Pacino's 53. Casting for Gail proved difficult because of the character's striptease scenes. The character needed someone who was both a talented dancer and actor.<ref name=\"De Palma\"/>\n* [[John Leguizamo]] as \"Benny Blanco from the Bronx\", an up-and-coming gangster who is determined to exceed Carlito's reputation but lacks any sense of ethics.<ref name=\"press pack p6\">''Carlito's Way'' Press Pack, p. 6.</ref>\n* [[Luis Guzm\u00e1n]] as Pachanga. In Koepp's first draft of the screenplay, Pachanga spoke in a very heavy slang style. Following rumbles from the Latino cast and crew, Koepp toned this down.<ref name=\"Koepp\"/>\n* [[\u00c1ngel Salazar]] as Walberto\n* [[Jorge Porcel]] as Reinaldo \"Ron\" Saso\n* [[Al Israel]] as Rolando Ruiz\n* Ingrid Rogers as Steffie\n* [[James Rebhorn]] as District Attorney Bill Norwalk\n* [[John Finn]] as Detective Duncan\n* [[Michael P.

Pacino was working out for his movie ''[[Serpico]]'' when he met [[New York state supreme court]] Judge [[Edwin Torres (judge)|Edwin Torres]] (the author who was writing the novels ''Carlito's Way'' and ''After Hours''). When the novels were completed Pacino read them and liked them, especially the character of Carlito.<ref name=\"hot dog p30\">''Hot Dog'' magazine, August 2000, P. 30.</ref> Inspiration for the novels came from Torres' background: the East Harlem barrio where he was born and its atmosphere of [[gangs]], drugs and [[poverty]].<ref name=\"press pack p2\">''Carlito's Way'' Press Pack, p. 2.</ref>  In 1989, Pacino faced a $6 million [[lawsuit]] from [[film producer|producer]] [[Elliott Kastner]]. Kastner claimed Pacino had gone back on an agreement to star in his version of a Carlito movie with [[Marlon Brando]] as criminal lawyer David Kleinfeld. The suit was dropped and the project was abandoned.<ref name=\"hot dog p30\"/>\n\nPacino went to producer [[Martin Bregman]] with the intention of getting a Carlito Brigante film made and showed him an early draft of a screenplay, which Bregman rejected.<ref name=\"Bregman\">{{cite video |people=Martin Bregman |title=The Making of Carlito's Way |medium=DVD |publisher=Universal |date=2004}}</ref> Both Bregman and Pacino agreed that the character of Brigante would provide a suitable showcase for Pacino's talents.<ref name=\"Bregman\"/> Bregman approached screenwriter David Koepp, who had just finished writing the script for Bregman's forthcoming ''[[The Shadow]],'' and asked him to write the script for ''Carlito's Way''.<ref name=\"press pack p4\">''Carlito's Way'' Press Pack, p. 4.</ref> The decision came that the screenplay would be based on the second novel ''After Hours''. Carlito at this stage would match closer with Pacino's age.<ref name=\"Torres\">{{cite video |people=Edwin Torres |title=The Making of Carlito's Way |medium=DVD |publisher=Universal |date=2004}}</ref> Although based primarily on the second novel, the title ''Carlito's Way'' remained,<ref name=\"Torres\"/> mainly because of the existence of Martin Scorsese's movie ''[[After Hours (film)|After Hours]]''.<ref name=\"press pack p4\"/> Bregman would work closely with Koepp for two years to develop the [[shooting script]] for ''Carlito's Way''.<ref name=\"press pack p4\"/>\n\nKoepp wrestled with the [[voice-over]] throughout the writing process. Initially the voice-over was to take place in the hospital, but De Palma suggested the train station platform.<ref name=\"Koepp\">{{cite video |people=David Koepp |title=The Making of Carlito's Way |medium=DVD |publisher=Universal |date=2004}}</ref>  The hospital scenes were written 25 to 30 times because the actors had trouble with the sequence, with Pacino even thinking that Carlito would not go to the hospital. With one final re-write Koepp managed to make the scene work to Pacino's satisfaction.<ref name=\"Koepp\"/> In the novels Kleinfeld does not die, but De Palma has a huge sense of justice and retribution. He could not have Carlito killed off and have Kleinfeld live.<ref name=\"Koepp\"/>\n\nAt one point, ''[[The Long Good Friday]]'' director, [[John Mackenzie (director)|John Mackenzie]], was linked with the film. When ''Carlito's Way'' and its sequel ''After Hours'' were [[optioned]], Martin Bregman had [[Abel Ferrara]] in mind. However, when Bregman and Ferrara parted ways, De Palma was brought in. Bregman explained that this decision was not about \"getting the old team back together\", rather than making use of the best talent available.<ref name=\"hot dog p30\"/> De Palma, reluctantly, read the script and as soon as [[Spanish-speaking]] characters cropped up he feared it would be ''Scarface'' all over again.<ref name=\"De Palma\">{{cite video |people=Brian De Palma |title=The Making of Carlito's Way |medium=DVD |publisher=Universal |date=2004}}</ref> He said that he did not want to make another Spanish-speaking [[gangster movie]].<ref name=\"hot dog p30\"/> When De Palma finally did read it all the way through, he realized it was not what he thought it was. De Palma liked the script and envisioned it as a [[film noir|noir]] movie.<ref name=\"press pack p4\"/> Bregman supervised casting throughout the various stages of [[pre-production]], and carefully selected the creative team who would make the film a reality. This included [[production designer]] Richard Sylbert, [[film editor|editor]] [[Bill Pankow]], [[costume designer]] Aude Bronson-Howard and [[director of photography]] Stephen Burum.<ref name=\"press pack p7\">''Carlito's Way'' Press Pack\", p. 7.</ref>\n\nInitially, filming began on March 22, 1993, though the first scheduled shoot, the Grand Central Station [[Climax (narrative)|climax]], had to be changed when Pacino showed up on crutches. Instead, the tension-building pool hall sequence, where Carlito accompanies his young cousin Guajiro on an ill-fated drug deal, started the production.<ref name=\"hot dog p33\">''Hot Dog'' magazine, August 2000, p. 33.</ref> Because the film was heavily character based and featured little action, the early pool sequence had to be elaborate and set up right. A huge amount of time was spent setting it up and filming it.<ref name=\"De Palma\"/> After the [[film studio]] had viewed a cut of the pool hall sequence, a note was passed onto the crew stating that they felt the scene was too long. De Palma spent more time adding to the sequence and with the help of editor Bill Pankow made it work. The producers came back saying \"much better shorter.\"<ref name=\"Koepp\"/>\n\nApart from the poster sequence, which was shot in Florida, the entire movie was filmed on [[Filming location|location]] in New York. De Palma roamed [[Manhattan]] searching for suitable visual locations. A tenement on 115th Street became the site of Carlito's homecoming: the barrio scene. The courtroom, in which Carlito thanks the prosecutor, was shot in Judge Torres's workplace, the State Supreme Court Building at 60 Centre Street.<ref name=\"hot dog p33\"/> The Club Paradise was initially in a West Side brownstone as the model for the book's postprandial premises. But this was considered too cramped for filming. A multi-level bistro club designed by De Palma took shape at the Kaufman-Astoria Studios in Long Island City, in a style of 1970's art deco disco.<ref name=\"press pack p8\">''Carlito's Way'' Press Pack\", p. 8.</ref>\n\nTony Taglialucci's escape from [[Rikers Island]], a night shoot mid-river, was considered impossible. Instead, the production used a [[Brooklyn]] shipyard where Kleinfeld's boat was lowered into an empty \"lock\" into which river water was pumped. Smoke machines and towers of space lights were installed.\n\nFor a climactic finale, De Palma staged a chase from the platform of the [[Harlem-125th Street (Metro-North)]] Station to the escalators of [[Grand Central Terminal]]. For the shoot, trains were re-routed and timed so that Pacino and his pursuers could dart from car to hurtling car.<ref name=\"press pack p8\"/> The length of the escalator scene during the climactic shoot out at Grand Central Station caused a headache for editor Pankow. He had to piece together the sequences so that the audience would be so tied up in the action that they would not be thinking about how long the escalator was running.<ref>{{cite video |people=Bill Pankow |title=The Making of Carlito's Way |medium=DVD |publisher=Universal |date=2004}}</ref>\n{{clear}}\n\n==Reception==\n''Carlito's Way'' wrapped on July 20, 1993, and was released on November 3, 1993.<ref name=\"hot dog p34\">''Hot Dog'' magazine, August 2000, p. 34.</ref> Critical response to the theatrical release was somewhat lukewarm.
