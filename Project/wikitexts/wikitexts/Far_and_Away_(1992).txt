Joseph tries killing Daniel, but he injures himself in the process and is nursed back to health by Nora, Daniel's wife, and her daughter, Shannon. Shannon plans to run away from home and travel to America, as there is land being given away for free there, taking Joseph with her as her servant.\n\nTogether on a ship bound for America, Shannon meets Mr. McGuire, who tells her and Joseph about free land being given away in [[Oklahoma Territory|Oklahoma]]. Shannon divulges that her collection of silver spoons will cover all expenses to get them to Oklahoma, and McGuire offers to help her find a shop to sell them to once they arrive. Upon arriving, McGuire is shot, and Shannon loses her spoons. Mike Kelly, a Boston [[ward boss]], finds Joseph and Shannon jobs and a room to rent. Joseph becomes a regular in [[bare-knuckle boxing]] matches at Boss Kelly's club to make extra cash.\n\nJoseph discovers that Shannon has gone to Kelly's club to dance [[American burlesque|burlesque]]. The Irish men surrounding the couple beg him to fight for $200, which would get them to Oklahoma. Joseph agrees and is winning until he notices one of his backers groping Shannon. Joseph pushes through the crowd to free her, but is pushed back into the ring where he is defeated by a [[sucker punch]]. Joseph returns to their room to find Kelly and his thugs taking the money he and Shannon saved, and Joseph and Shannon are thrown out into the streets, homeless.\n\nCold and famished, the pair stay in a seemingly abandoned house. The owners of the house return and chase them away, shooting Shannon in the back. Joseph, knowing the Christies are looking for her in Boston, brings Shannon to the home where they're staying. Deciding Shannon will be better cared for by them, Joseph leaves, despite his obvious feelings for her. Joseph heads west to the [[Ozarks]], and finds work laying train track. He sees a wagon train out the door of his boxcar. Knowing it is headed for the Oklahoma land rush, Joseph abandons the railroad and joins the wagon train, arriving in time for the [[Land Run of 1893]].\n\nJoseph finds Shannon, Chase, and the Christies already in Oklahoma. Chase, having seen Joseph talking to Shannon, threatens to kill him if he goes near Shannon again. Joseph outpaces everybody and catches up with Shannon and Chase.  Joseph is ready to plant his claim flag, but Chase rushes on horseback at Joseph. A fight breaks out, with Joseph being crushed by the horse. Shannon runs to his side and rejects Chase when he questions her actions. Joseph professes his love for Shannon and dies in her arms, but comes back to life fully revived when Shannon reciprocates Joseph's love. They both drive the land stake into the ground and claim their prize land together.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Tom Cruise]] as Joseph Donnelly\n* [[Nicole Kidman]] as Shannon Christie\n* [[Thomas Gibson]] as Stephen Chase\n* [[Robert Prosky]] as Daniel Christie\n* [[Barbara Babcock]] as Nora Christie\n* [[Cyril Cusack]] as Danty Duff\n* [[Eileen Pollock]] as Molly Kay \n* [[Colm Meaney]] as Kelly\n* Douglas Gillison as Dermody\n* [[Michelle Johnson (actress)|Michelle Johnson]] as Grace\n* [[Clint Howard]] as Flynn\n* [[Rance Howard]] as Tomlin\n* [[Niall T\u00f3ib\u00edn]] as Joseph Donnelly's father\n* [[James Jude Courtney]] as Boxer\n}}\n\n==Production==\nThe film was shot in Montana for business reasons, but the [[Oklahoma Historical Society]] was involved in its production.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://newsok.com/article/2395384|title=Oklahomans Become Extras in \"Far and Away\"|last=Davis|first=Sandi|work=[[The Oklahoman]]|date=1992-05-22|access-date=2016-08-31}}</ref> Imagine Production Co. toured the areas around Montana for a week.
