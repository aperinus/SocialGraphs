[[Film adaption|Based on]] the 1935 short story \"Opera Hat\" by [[Clarence Budington Kelland]], which appeared in serial form in ''[[The American Magazine]]'', the screenplay was written by [[Robert Riskin]] in his fifth collaboration with Frank Capra.<ref name=\"poague\">Poague 1975, p. 17.</ref><ref name=\"mcbride\">McBride 1992, pp. 332</ref>{{TOC limit|limit=2}}\n\n==Plot==\nDuring the [[Great Depression]], Longfellow Deeds, the co-owner of a tallow works, part-time greeting card poet, and tuba-playing inhabitant of the hamlet of Mandrake Falls, [[Vermont]], inherits 20 million dollars from his late uncle, Martin Semple. Semple's scheming attorney, John Cedar, locates Deeds and takes him to [[New York City]]. Cedar gives his cynical troubleshooter, ex-newspaperman Cornelius Cobb, the task of keeping reporters away from Deeds. Cobb is outfoxed by star reporter Louise \"Babe\" Bennett, who appeals to Deeds' romantic fantasy of rescuing a damsel in distress by masquerading as a poor worker named Mary Dawson. She pretends to faint from exhaustion after \"walking all day to find a job\" and worms her way into his confidence. Bennett proceeds to write a series of enormously popular articles on Longfellow, portraying him as a [[yokel]] who has suddenly inherited riches, and giving him the nickname \"Cinderella Man\".\n\nCedar tries to get Deeds' [[power of attorney]] in order to keep his own financial misdeeds secret. Deeds, however, proves to be a shrewd judge of character, easily fending off Cedar and other greedy opportunists. He wins Cobb's wholehearted respect and eventually Babe's love. She quits her job in shame, but before she can tell Deeds the truth about herself, Cobb finds it out and tells Deeds. Deeds is left heartbroken and decides to return to Mandrake Falls. After he has packed and is about to leave, a dispossessed farmer stomps into his mansion and threatens him with a gun. He expresses his scorn for the seemingly heartless, ultra-rich man, who will not lift a finger to help the multitudes of desperate poor. After the intruder comes to his senses, Deeds realizes what he can do with his troublesome fortune. He decides to provide fully equipped {{convert|10|acre|adj=on|0|abbr=off|lk=on}} farms free to thousands of homeless families if they will work the land for three years.\n\nCedar joins forces with Deeds' only other relative, Semple, and his domineering wife, in an attempt to have Deeds declared [[Competence (law)|mentally incompetent]]. A sanity hearing is scheduled to determine who should control the fortune. During the hearing, Cedar calls an expert who diagnoses Deeds with [[bipolar disorder|manic depression]] based on Babe's articles and witnesses to his recent behavior. Though Deeds has pledged to defend himself, he refuses to speak. Babe speaks up passionately on his behalf, castigating herself for what she did to him. When he realizes that she truly loves him, he begins speaking, systematically punching holes in Cedar's case and then landing one in his face. The judge declares him to be not only sane, but \"the sanest man who ever walked into this courtroom\". Victorious, Deeds and Babe kiss.\n\n==Cast==\n[[Image:Gary Cooper in Mr. Deeds Goes to Town trailer.JPG|thumb|[[Gary Cooper]] and Jean Arthur]]\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Gary Cooper]] as Longfellow Deeds\n* [[Jean Arthur]] as Babe Bennett\n* [[George Bancroft (actor)|George Bancroft]] as MacWade\n* [[Lionel Stander]] as Cornelius Cobb\n* [[Douglass Dumbrille]] as John Cedar\n* [[Raymond Walburn]] as Walter\n* [[H.

Thus, Capra began adapting ''Mr. Deeds Goes to Town''. As production began, the two lead actors were cast: Gary Cooper as Longfellow Deeds and Jean Arthur as Louise \"Babe\" Bennett/Mary Dawson. Cooper was Capra's \"first, last and only choice\" for the pivotal role of the eccentric Longfellow Deeds.<ref>McBride 1992, p. 342.</ref>\n\nArthur was not the first choice for the role, but [[Carole Lombard]], the original female lead, quit the film just three days before principal photography, in favor of a starring role in ''[[My Man Godfrey]]''.<ref name=\"scherle\">Scherle and Levy 1977, p. 137.</ref> The first scenes shot on the Fox Studios' New England street lot were in place before Capra found his replacement heroine in a rush screening.<ref name=\"Capra 1971, p. 184\">Capra 1971, p. 184.</ref> The opening sequences had to be reshot when Capra decided against the broad comedy approach that had originally been written.<ref name=\"scherle\"/>\n\nDespite his penchant for coming in \"under budget\", Capra spent an additional five shooting days in multiple takes, testing angles and \"new\" perspectives, treating the production as a type of workshop exercise. Due to the increased shooting schedule, the film came in at $38,936 more than the Columbia budget for a total of $806,774.<ref>McBride 1992, p. 346.</ref> Throughout pre-production and early principal photography, the project still retained Kelland's original title, ''Opera Hat'', although Capra tried out some other titles including ''A Gentleman Goes to Town'' and ''Cinderella Man'' before settling on a name that was the winning entry in a contest held by the Columbia Pictures publicity department.<ref>McBride 1992, p. 328.</ref>\n\n==Reception==\nThe film was generally treated as likable fare by critics and audiences alike. Novelist [[Graham Greene]], then also a film critic, was effusive that this was Capra's finest film to date, describing Capra's treatment as \"a kinship with his audience, a sense of common life, a morality\".<ref>Greene, Graham. \"Mr. Deeds\".
