The film received negative reviews.\n\nThe film's title is a reference to the 1963 [[My Boyfriend's Back (song)|song of the same name]] by [[The Angels (American group)|The Angels]] (which is used in the promotional trailers, but not featured in the film itself). The original title of the film, ''Johnny Zombie'', was changed shortly before the film's theatrical release. [[Philip Seymour Hoffman]], [[Matthew McConaughey]], and [[Matthew Fox (actor)|Matthew Fox]] appear in small roles in the film.\n\n==Plot==\nJohnny Dingle has been in love with Missy McCloud since they were kids. In his senior year of high school, he decides to fake a robbery at Missy\u2019s job with his best friend, Eddie. He hopes that by stopping the \"robbery\" he will impress her and she will go to the prom with him.\n\nDuring the \"robbery\" a real robber holds Johnny and Missy at gunpoint. Thinking it is Eddie, Johnny dies taking a bullet meant for Missy. After the funeral, Johnny rises from the grave. He is greeted by Murray the gravedigger, who warns him that he can\u2019t leave the cemetery. Johnny ignores him and goes back to his home.\n\nMissy is hesitant to be around Johnny, but changes her mind when her boyfriend Buck and his dim-witted friend Chuck discriminate against him for being a Zombie. They go on a date, which goes well until Missy accidentally rips Johnny\u2019s ear off.\n\nJohnny goes to the town doctor, Dr. Bronson, who refers him to a woman named Maggie, the widow of a zombie.  She tells Johnny that he needs to eat the flesh of the living to stop decaying.\n\nJohnny and Missy meet up at the library, where he\u2019s attacked by Buck and Chuck. Chuck accidentally hits himself in the head with an ax and dies. Johnny eats Chuck's body, invoking the wrath of Chuck\u2019s father, Big Chuck.\n\nMissy\u2019s father, the town sheriff, tells Johnny to leave town for his own safety. Johnny doesn\u2019t listen and returns to Missy at night, but leaves when he bites her arm. He\u2019s captured by Dr.Bronson, who attempts to dissect Johnny and create a youth formula from his zombie cells. Johnny escapes when Big Chuck leads a mob to kill him, with Missy and Eddie helping him. He flees to the cemetery, where Murray, his parents, Eddie, and Missy defend him, earning him the town and the sheriff\u2019s acceptance. Johnny and Missy dance, but Johnny begins to decay and dies.\n\nIn Heaven, he\u2019s told by the gatekeeper that he was not meant to die in the robbery, and he is sent back the moment before the robber entered. The events replay but Johnny survives this time due to the bullet hitting Missy\u2019s locket. Johnny and Missy go to the prom as a couple.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Andrew Lowery]] as Johnny Dingle\n* [[Traci Lind]] as Missy McCloud\n* Danny Zorn as Eddie\n* [[Edward Herrmann]] as Mr. Dingle\n* [[Mary Beth Hurt]] as Mrs. Dingle\n* [[Jay O.
