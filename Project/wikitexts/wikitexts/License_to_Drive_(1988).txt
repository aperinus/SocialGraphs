He fails the knowledge portion of the exam, but inadvertently causes a computer surge.\n\nLes' failing marks are thought to be irretrievable, but the Department of Motor Vehicles lets him pass the exam after comparing him to his twin sister's high marks. He eventually passes the road test, but his real test scores are finally retrieved and his license is revoked.\n\nLes tries concealing the truth from his parents, but his mother finds out the truth and his father grounds him for two weeks. Les made plans to drive his grandfather's prized 1972 [[Cadillac Sedan de Ville]] prior and decides to sneak away anyway for a joyride with Mercedes.\n\nMercedes gets drunk and then she and Les accidentally cave in the hood of the car after dancing on it. She passes out; Les panics and goes to his best friend Dean's house to have him fix the dent in the car's hood.\n\nDean persuades Les to continue the joyride along with their friend Charles, but are unaware Les still does not have his license. The three put Mercedes in the trunk of the car and continue their night on the town, causing even more damage to the Cadillac. Meanwhile, Mrs. Anderson wakes up her husband late in the night announcing she is in labor.\n\nThe next day, Les drops off Charles and Dean at their homes. Mercedes wakes up and believes that the night prior was a dream. Les drops her off at her house where they share a kiss. Les gets in trouble with his father Robert after returning home with the  damaged Cadillac.\n\nMrs. Anderson is still in labor, but since the car's transmission will not shift into drive he is forced to drive his family to the hospital in reverse. She is taken into the hospital but a crane fails outside and a falling steel girder crushes the Cadillac, much to the shock of Les and Robert.\n\nThe family tries to explain the state of the Cadillac to Les' grandfather, but Grandpa laughs it off as he reveals he has severely damaged his son's own [[BMW]] in an accident. Robert gives the BMW to Les and jokingly tells him to take good care of it.\n\nAlthough Les thanks his father, he has changed his mind and doesn't want it anymore. Mercedes pulls up in a white [[Volkswagen Golf Cabriolet]] and picks up Les, who gets in the driver's seat and drives away with her.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Corey Haim]] as Les Anderson\n* [[Corey Feldman]] as Dean\n* [[Carol Kane]] as Mrs. Anderson\n* [[Richard Masur]] as Mr. Robert Anderson\n* [[Heather Graham]] as Mercedes Lane\n* [[Michael Manasseri]] as Charles\n* [[Parley Baer]] as Grandpa\n* Harvey Miller as The Professor\n* Michael A.
