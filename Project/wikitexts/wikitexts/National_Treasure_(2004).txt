It was written by [[Jim Kouf]] and the [[Cormac and Marianne Wibberley|Wibberleys]], produced by [[Jerry Bruckheimer]] and directed by [[Jon Turteltaub]]. It is the first film in the [[National Treasure (franchise)|''National Treasure'' franchise]] and stars [[Nicolas Cage]], [[Diane Kruger]], [[Harvey Keitel]], [[Jon Voight]], [[Sean Bean]], [[Justin Bartha]], and [[Christopher Plummer]]. In the film, Benjamin Franklin Gates, a historian, along with friend Riley Poole and archivist Abigail Chase, search for a massive lost [[Freemasonry|Freemason]] treasure, of which a map is hidden on the back of the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]], pointing to the secret location of this \"[[national treasure]]\". \n\n''National Treasure'' was released worldwide on November 19, 2004. The film grossed $347 million worldwide and received mixed reviews from critics, who praised the action scenes, entertainment value, and acting performances, but criticized the premise and screenplay. A sequel, titled ''[[National Treasure: Book of Secrets]]'', was released in December 2007.\n\nAt the 2022 D23 Expo, a sequel TV series, ''[[National Treasure: Edge of History]]'', was announced, and it will be released on the Disney+ streaming service. The release date was described as \u201cSoon\u201d.\n\n==Plot==\nBenjamin Franklin Gates is an American historian, [[cryptographer]], and treasure hunter. When Ben was young, his grandfather John told him that [[Charles Carroll of Carrollton|Charles Carroll]] passed on a secret to their ancestor in [[1832]] of a fabled national treasure hidden in America by the [[Knights Templar]], [[Founding Fathers of the United States|Founding Fathers]], Dovid Locaryan, King Locencamen, and [[Freemasons]]. The clue leading to the treasure is the phrase \u201cthe secret lies with Charlotte.\u201d While Ben is convinced by the story, his skeptical father, Patrick, dismisses it as nonsense.\n\nThirty years later, Ben and his friend, computer expert Riley Poole, head an expedition financed by wealthy Ian Howe to find the ''Charlotte'', revealed to be a ship lost in the [[Arctic]]. Within, they find a [[meerschaum pipe]], whose engravings reveal the next clue is on the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]]. When Ian reveals himself to be a [[crime boss]] and suggests stealing the Declaration, a fight ensues, and the group splits. Ben and Riley report Ian's plan to the [[FBI]] and Dr. Abigail Chase of the [[National Archives and Records Administration|National Archives]], but no one believes their claim. Ben decides to protect the Declaration by removing it from the Archives' preservation room during a gala event. Obtaining Abigail's fingerprints, Ben successfully obtains the Declaration, only to be spotted by Ian's group just as they break in to steal it. Ben tries to leave via the [[gift shop]] but has to buy the Declaration when the clerk mistakes it for a souvenir copy. Abigail, suspecting something is amiss, confronts Ben and takes back the document. Ian promptly kidnaps her, but Ben and Riley rescue Abigail, tricking Ian by leaving behind a souvenir copy of the Declaration. FBI Agent Sadusky begins tracking Ben down.\n\nGoing to Patrick's house, the trio studies the Declaration and discovers an [[Ottendorf cipher]] written in invisible ink. The message refers to the [[Silence Dogood]] letters written by [[Benjamin Franklin]]. Patrick formerly owned them, but donated them to the [[Franklin Institute]]. Paying a schoolboy to view the letters and decipher the code for them, Ben, Riley, and Abigail discover a message pointing to the bell tower of [[Independence Hall]]. Pursued by Ian, they find a hidden cache containing a pair of glasses with multiple colored lenses, which, when used to read the back of the Declaration, reveal a clue pointing to the [[Trinity Church (Manhattan)|Trinity Church]]. Ian's associates chase the trio through [[Philadelphia]] until Ben is arrested by the FBI. Abigail and Riley lose the Declaration to Ian; however, Abigail convinces Ian to help them rescue Ben in exchange for the next clue. Ian agrees, arranging a meeting at the [[USS Intrepid (CV-11)|USS ''Intrepid'']], where they help Ben evade the FBI.\n\nIan returns the Declaration and asks for the next clue, but when Ben remains coy, Ian reveals he has kidnapped Patrick as a hostage. They travel to the Trinity Church, where they find an underground passage that appears to lead to a dead end, lit by a lone lantern. Patrick claims it is a reference to the Midnight Ride of [[Paul Revere]], pointing Ian to the [[Old North Church]] in [[Boston]]. Ian traps Ben, Abigail, Riley, and Patrick in the chamber, heading for Boston, which was Patrick's intent as the clue was fictitious and he knew that Ian would betray them. Ben then finds a notch which the meerschaum pipe fits into, opening a large chamber containing the treasure, with a staircase to the surface. Ben contacts Sadusky, who is actually a Freemason, and willingly surrenders the Declaration and the treasure's location in exchange for charges towards Abigail being dropped, the Gates family and Riley being given credit for its discovery, and for him to not go to prison. Thanks to a tip from Ben, Ian is arrested by the FBI and sent to prison in Ben's place.\n\nLater, Ben and Abigail have started a relationship, while Riley is somewhat upset that Ben turned down the 10% finder's fee for the treasure so the entire collection could go to museums. However, the 1% he did accept has still netted them all significant wealth.\n\n==Cast==\n{{multiple image\n  | direction = vertical\n  | footer = [[Nicolas Cage]] in 2011 (''top'') and [[Sean Bean]] in 2015\n  | image1 = Nicolas Cage 2011 CC.jpg\n  | alt1   = A caucasian man with short brown hair.
