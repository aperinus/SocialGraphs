The film primarily follows the events during the writing of Capote's 1965 nonfiction book ''[[In Cold Blood]]''. The film was based on [[Gerald Clarke (author)|Gerald Clarke]]'s 1988 biography ''Capote''. It was released September 30, 2005, coinciding with Capote's birthday.\n\nThe film became a box office success and received acclaim from critics for Hoffman's lead performance. It eventually won several awards, and was nominated for 5 [[Academy Awards]] including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]] for Miller, [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]] for [[Catherine Keener]], and [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Adapted Screenplay]], with Hoffman winning the [[Academy Award for Best Actor]].\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1959, [[Clutter family murders|the bodies of the Clutter family are discovered]] on their [[Kansas]] farm. While reading ''[[The New York Times]]'', [[Truman Capote]] is riveted by the story and calls ''[[The New Yorker]]'' magazine editor [[William Shawn]] to tell him that he plans to document the tragedy.\n\nCapote travels to Kansas, inviting childhood friend [[Harper Lee|Nelle Harper Lee]] to come along. He intends to interview those involved with the Clutter family, with Lee as his go-between and facilitator. [[Alvin Dewey]], the Kansas Bureau of Investigation's lead detective on the case, brushes him off. Still, Dewey's wife Marie is a fan of Capote's writing and persuades her husband to invite Capote and Lee to their house for dinner.\n\nCapote's stories of movie sets and film stars captivate Marie. Over time, her husband warms to Capote and allows him to view the photographs of the victims. The Deweys, Lee, and Capote are having dinner when the murder suspects, [[Perry Edward Smith|Perry Smith]] and [[Richard Hickock|Richard \"Dick\" Hickock]], are caught. Flattery, bribery, and a keen insight into the human condition facilitate Capote's visits to the prison where the accused are held.\n\nCapote begins to form an attachment to Smith. He informs Shawn of his intent to expand the story into a full-length book. Following the trial and conviction, after which both Smith and Hickock are sentenced to death, Capote gains continued access to the murderers by bribing Warden Marshall Krutch.\n\nCapote spends the following years regularly visiting Smith and learning about his life, excepting a year-long stint when he goes to Morocco and Spain to write the \"first three parts\" of the book, accompanied by his romantic partner [[Jack Dunphy]].\n\nThe story of Smith's life, his remorseful manner, and his emotional sincerity impress Capote, who becomes emotionally attached to him despite the gruesome murders. Capote aids Smith and Hickock by obtaining expert legal counsel for them and initiating an appeal. Still, he is frustrated, as Smith declines to relate exactly what happened the night of the murders.\n\nThough initially an effort to provide proper representation and extend Capote's opportunity to speak with the killers, the appeals process drags on for several years. Without the court case being resolved, Capote feels he is stuck with a story without an ending, and he is unable to complete his book. Eventually, he gets Smith to describe the killings and his thoughts at the time in great detail. He has what he wants from Smith, but he sees a callousness and selfishness in his own actions in the process.\n\nNow with everything in hand, Capote still must wait for the appeals process to conclude before he feels he can publish his work. Over time, Lee's best-selling novel ''[[To Kill a Mockingbird]]'' is turned into a movie, but Capote is unable to share in the joy of his friend's success, too caught up in drinking through his own misery.\n\nWith the last appeal rejected, Smith pleads for Capote to return before he is executed, but Capote cannot bring himself to do so. A telegram from Smith to Harper Lee ultimately compels Capote to return to Kansas. There he is an eyewitness as Smith and Hickock are executed.\n\nCapote talks to Lee about the horrifying experience and laments that he could not do anything to stop it. She replies, \"Maybe not. The fact is you didn't want to.\" While returning home, Capote looks through photos from the case and at the writings and drawings given to him by Smith.\n\nAn epilogue points out that ''In Cold Blood'' turned Capote into the most famous writer in America, also noting that he never finished another book. A postscript gives the [[epigraph (literature)|epigraph]] he would have chosen for the title of ''[[Answered Prayers: The Unfinished Novel|Answered Prayers]]'': \"More tears are shed over answered prayers than unanswered ones\",<ref>{{cite book |first=Peter |last=Shelley |title=Philip Seymour Hoffman.

The initial appeal was handled by public defenders and subsequent appeals by the [[Kansas Legal Aid Society]] after they were contacted by Hickock. This is mentioned in Capote's [[In Cold Blood|book]]<ref name=\"FAIR\" /> and there is no evidence he ever offered to help find a lawyer.<ref name=\"Guardian\" />\n\nCapote mainly corresponded with Hickock and Smith through letters, visiting them in person less than half a dozen times.

Most of their relationship was conducted by letter. Yet the film does capture and explore the peculiar tenor of that relationship. The powerful scene in which the betrayed Smith yells at Capote, \"What's the name of your book?\" is based on a letter the real Perry Smith wrote to Capote on 12 April 1964: \"I've been told that the book is to be coming off the press and to be sold after our executions.
