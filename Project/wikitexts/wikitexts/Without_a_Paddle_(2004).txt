The film stars [[Seth Green]], [[Matthew Lillard]], [[Dax Shepard]], [[Ethan Suplee]], [[Abraham Benrubi]], [[Rachel Blanchard]], [[Christina Moore]], [[Bonnie Somerville]], [[Ray Baker (actor)|Ray Baker]] and [[Burt Reynolds]]. It tells the story of three reunited childhood friends going on a trip up a remote river in order to search for the loot of long-lost airplane hijacker [[D. B. Cooper]].\n\nA direct-to-video sequel, entitled ''[[Without a Paddle: Nature's Calling]]'', was released in January 2009.\n\n==Plot==\n12 years after graduating from high school, three friends, Jerry, Dan, and Tom, find out that their childhood friend Billy has died in a [[Parasailing|parasailing]] accident. After the funeral, they revisit the group's old tree-house and find a map leading to [[D. B. Cooper]]'s lost treasure, which Billy had apparently been working on for his entire life. Dan takes a break from his job as a doctor and joins Jerry and Tom on a camping trip to find the treasure.\n\nCanoeing down the river, they eventually stop on the riverbank for the night. They realize that they forgot to bring food, so Tom goes out to catch some fish. However, the activity attracts a [[Grizzly bear|grizzly bear]] and it chases them. When Dan falls, the bear seemingly treats him like a cub until he breaks free, following the others up a tree. In the morning, they find all of their gear has been ripped up and completely destroyed by the bear.\n\nThe trio takes off into the river but are unable to read the damaged map, causing them to go the wrong way. They go over a waterfall, and although they survive, their canoe is wrecked. Venturing into the woods with a compass, they find themselves at a pot farm where rednecks Dennis and Elwood, mistake them for thieves and start shooting at them. They escape, burning the pot garden down in the process. This enrages Dennis and Elwood, who decide to hunt them down.\n\nLater, far into the forest, the trio meets [[hippie]] girls Flower and Butterfly, who treat them in their tree. Using a radio the farmers find them, but the women drop paper bags full of feces at the farmers to distract them while the trio escapes. They are saved from the thunderstorm by a mountain man who takes them to his hut and provides them with clothes. He later reveals himself to be Del Knox, Cooper's partner before his death.\n\nThe next morning, the farmers find them, assaulting the hut. The trio escapes while Del shoots at the two with his dual wield revolvers. The trio stumbles upon the site of Cooper's crash-landing, discovering his skeleton and the suitcase he used to hold the ransom money down an old mine shaft. They realize he burned his share of the money attempting to survive.\n\nAs Dan crawls through a small tunnel to find a way out, the farmers find Tom and Jerry, and a fistfight ensues. Eventually, Sheriff Briggs, who had earlier helped the trio, intervenes. He then reveals himself to be the farmers' employer. Jerry arms a grenade taken from Dennis and throws it at the pot dealers. It explodes, causing a tree to fall on the farmers and the sheriff, who are soon arrested.\n\nIn the closing scenes, Del gives Tom, Jerry and Dan what's left of D.B's non burnt money ($100,000) but Jerry and Dan decide Tom needs it more than they do, so they let Tom keep it, while Del gives D.B. a proper funeral. Jerry proposes to his girlfriend Denise, Dan starts a relationship with Flower, and Tom becomes a camp counselor for a children's summer camp where he tells his troop an exaggerated version of the trip.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Seth Green]] as Dan Mott\n** Jarred Rumbold as young Dan\n* [[Matthew Lillard]] as Jerry Conlaine\n** Andrew Hampton as young Jerry\n* [[Dax Shepard]] as Tom Marshall\n** Matthew Price as young Tom\n* [[Burt Reynolds]] as Del Knox\n* [[Bonnie Somerville]] as Denise\n* [[Ethan Suplee]] as Elwood\n* [[Ray Baker (actor)|Ray Baker]] as Hank Briggs\n* [[Abraham Benrubi]] as Dennis\n* [[Rachel Blanchard]] as Flower\n* [[Christina Moore]] as Butterfly\n* [[Antony Starr]] as Billy Newwood\n** Carl Snell as young Billy\n* [[Scott Adsit]] as Greasy man\n* [[Danielle Cormack]] as Toni\n* [[Bart the Bear 2]] as Grizzly bear\n** [[Frank Welker]] as Grizzly bear vocal effects\n\n==Reception==\n===Box office===\n''Without a Paddle'' ranked second in its opening weekend behind fellow newcomer ''[[Exorcist: The Beginning]]'', earning $13,528,946.
