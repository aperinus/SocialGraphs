A conditional 2016 release date was announced in May 2015, which led to a closer and faster pre-production relationship between writer and director. The film shares similarities to ''[[Battle for the Planet of the Apes]]'' (1973), with emphasis on the impact of [[psychosocial development]] and interaction of apes and humans. Casting began in August 2015 and finished that October, with [[principal photography]] commencing soon thereafter and concluding in March 2016, with filming locations including [[Lower Mainland]] and the [[Kananaskis Range]].\n\n''War for the Planet of the Apes'' premiered on 10 July 2017 at the [[School of Visual Arts|SVA Theatre]] in [[New York City]], and was theatrically released worldwide by 20th Century Fox on 14 July.<ref name=\"officialsite\">{{Cite web |title=Official website |url=http://www.foxmovies.com/movies/war-for-the-planet-of-the-apes/ |access-date=2 April 2017 |publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> The film received critical acclaim,<!--- as sourced: \"a level of critical praise that would make even the first lady of superhero movies jealous\" ---> with praise for Reeves' direction, Serkis' performance, visual effects, themes, emotional weight, [[Michael Giacchino]]'s score, and [[Michael Seresin]]'s cinematography.

A platoon assaults an ape outpost and several paramilitaries such as Preacher are captured. Caesar was not surprised when he was informed that there are apes derogatorily called \"donkeys\" serving the militia. The tribe releases the humans to show the colonel a desire for peace; the \"donkey\" named Red flees by injuring the ape Winter. Caesar's eldest son, Blue Eyes, and friend Rocket return from an [[oasis]] in a desert that is ideal for a safer home. The colonel leads a team in infiltrating the apes' home that night and kills Caesar's wife and Blue Eyes after mistaking him for Caesar. The apes are unable to find Winter, who betrayed them and had purposefully let Red go.\n\nRocket, Maurice and Luca accompany Caesar to serve as a decoy as the tribe journey. Caesar kills a paramilitary in self-defense and find the man's mute daughter whom Maurice befriends, giving her a rag doll. Winter is found serving as a \"donkey\" at a militia camp. He informs that the colonel has left and attempts to call out for help, but the other apes restrain Winter and Caesar accidentally suffocates him. Some paramilitaries were abandoned and left for dead. A man who was shot reveals that he is mute like the girl.\n\nCaesar's group chases someone who has stolen one of their horses and is surprised to see that he is another intelligent ape, named Bad Ape. Bad Ape informs them that the militia is at a quarantine facility with an arsenal in the mountains. Attempting to get close, Luca is killed and Caesar is captured. Caesar learns that his tribe was captured and is being forced to build a wall.\n\nCaesar deduces that the militia is barricading the facility to fend off the United States army. The colonel explains the \"[[holy war]]\": the simian flu has mutated and the infected become mute and [[Devolution (biology)|devolve]], and he had elected to kill his son and other carriers before they could infect other people. The U.S army is searching for a cure through the manipulation of nature again. The colonel publicly starves Caesar to force the tribe to work. The mute girl, named [[Chevrolet Chevy II / Nova|Nova]]<!--- named from car badging that Bad Ape had collected ---> by Maurice, sneaks into the facility to give Caesar water and her doll. Rocket allows himself to be captured to prevent Nova from being seen. The colonel later confiscates the doll.\n\nCaesar and Rocket manage to free the apes via an underground tunnel leading out of the facility. The facility comes under attack by the army and Caesar sneaks into the colonel's quarters and is about to shoot him but realizes the colonel has become mute after handling the doll. The colonel instead commits suicide.\n\nThe escaping apes are caught in the crossfire. Caesar attempts to blow up a fuel tank to take out the militia from behind but is shot by Preacher. Red has a change of heart and kills Preacher but is immediately killed by another paramilitary. This allows Caesar to blow up the tank, triggering an avalanche that kills the militia and the army while the apes carry Nova and survive by climbing nearby trees.\n\nThe apes and Nova reach the oasis. As Maurice and Caesar watch Nova and Caesar's son play in their new home, Maurice discovers Caesar's wound. He promises Caesar that his son will know who Caesar was and what he did for the apes before Caesar dies.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Andy Serkis]] as [[Caesar (Planet of the Apes)|Caesar]], a [[chimpanzee]] who is leader to a tribe of enhanced [[ape]]s.<ref name=\"Greer\" />\n* [[Woody Harrelson]] as the Colonel<!-- Most sources and Harrelson in the cited interview call the role The Colonel.

I think you've probably read that I sort of described it where in the first film was very much about his rise from humble beginnings to being a revolutionary. The second movie was about having to rise to the challenge of being a great leader in the most difficult of times.
