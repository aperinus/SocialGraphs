It was directed by [[Chris Sanders]] and [[Dean DeBlois]] from a screenplay by [[William Davies (screenwriter)|Will Davies]], Sanders, and DeBlois, and stars the voices of [[Jay Baruchel]], [[Gerard Butler]], [[Craig Ferguson]], [[America Ferrera]], [[Jonah Hill]], [[Christopher Mintz-Plasse]], [[T.J. Miller]], and [[Kristen Wiig]]. The story takes place in Berk, a mythical [[Vikings|Viking]] village; Hiccup, an undersized teen wishing to become a [[dragon slayer]] like the other Vikings, injures a rare Night Fury dragon but is unable to bring himself to kill it. He instead helps and befriends the dragon, and quickly discovers that things are not exactly as they seem in the Viking-Dragon conflict.\n\n''How to Train Your Dragon'' premiered at the [[Universal Amphitheater|Gibson Amphitheater]] on March 21, 2010,<ref name=\"HTTYDPremiere\" /> and was released in the United States five days later on March 26. The film was a commercial success, earning nearly $500 million worldwide. It was widely acclaimed, being praised for its animation, voice acting, writing, musical score, and 3D sequences. It was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Animated Feature]] and [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Best Original Score]] at the [[83rd Academy Awards]], but lost to ''[[Toy Story 3]]'' and ''[[The Social Network]]'', respectively. ''How to Train Your Dragon'' also won ten [[Annie Awards]], including [[Annie Award for Best Animated Feature|Best Animated Feature]]. ''How to Train Your Dragon'' is the first entry in what would become the [[How to Train Your Dragon|multimedia franchise of the same name]], which includes two more films\u2014''[[How to Train Your Dragon 2]]'' (2014) and ''[[How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World]]'' (2019).\n\n== Plot == \nThe [[Vikings|viking village]] of Berk is frequently attacked by [[dragon]]s, which steal livestock and endanger the villagers. Hiccup, the awkward fifteen-year-old son of the village chieftain, Stoick the Vast, is deemed too weak to fight the dragons. Instead, he creates mechanical devices under his apprenticeship with Gobber, the village blacksmith, though Hiccup's inventions often backfire. Hiccup uses a [[bolas]] launcher to shoot down a Night Fury, a rare and dangerous dragon, but cannot bring himself to kill the creature and sets him free.\n\nBefore leaving with his fleet to find and destroy the dragons' nest, Stoick enters Hiccup in a dragon-fighting class taught by Gobber with fellow teenagers Fishlegs, Snotlout, twins Ruffnut and Tuffnut, and Astrid, on whom Hiccup has a crush. Failing in training, Hiccup returns to the forest and finds the Night Fury trapped in a cove, unable to fly because Hiccup's bolas tore off half his tail fin. Hiccup gradually befriends the dragon, naming him 'Toothless' after his retractable teeth, and designs a harness and [[prosthetic]] fin allowing Toothless to fly with Hiccup riding him.\n\nLearning dragon behavior from Toothless, Hiccup is able to subdue the captive dragons during training, earning admiration from his peers but suspicion from Astrid. Stoick's fleet returns home unsuccessful, though he is gladdened by Hiccup's unexpected success in dragon training. Hiccup is judged the winner of his training class, and must kill a dragon for his final exam. He tries to run away with Toothless, but Astrid ambushes him in the forest and discovers the dragon. Hiccup takes Astrid for a sunset flight to demonstrate that Toothless is friendly, but Toothless is hypnotically drawn to the dragons' nest. There, a gargantuan dragon named the Red Death summons the smaller dragons to feed it live food to avoid being eaten themselves. Realizing the dragons have been forced to attack Berk to survive, Astrid wishes to tell the village, but Hiccup advises against it to protect Toothless.\n\nIn his final exam, Hiccup faces a captive Monstrous Nightmare dragon, and tries to subdue him to prove that dragons can be peaceful. When Stoick inadvertently angers the dragon into attacking, Toothless escapes the cove to protect Hiccup, but is captured by the Vikings. After Hiccup accidentally reveals that Toothless knows the location of the dragons' nest, Stoick ignores his son's warnings about the Red Death and disowns him, setting off for the nest with Toothless chained to the lead ship as a guide. Hiccup is devastated, but Astrid prompts him to realize that he spared Toothless out of compassion, not weakness. Regaining his confidence, Hiccup shows Astrid and their friends how to befriend the training dragons, and they set out after Toothless.\n\nStoick and his Vikings locate and break open the dragon's nest, awakening the Red Death, which soon overwhelms them. Hiccup, Astrid, and their friends fly in on the training dragons, distracting the Red Death. Hiccup attempts to free Toothless from the damaged ship; the two nearly drown, but Stoick rescues them, reconciling with his son. Toothless and Hiccup lure and kill the Red Death. In the ensuing explosion, Toothless shields Hiccup, but Hiccup loses his lower left leg and faints. \n\nAwakening some time later, Hiccup finds that Gobber has fashioned him a prosthetic, and he is now admired by his village, including Astrid, who kisses him. Berk begins a new era of humans and dragons living in harmony.\n\n== Voice cast ==\n* [[Jay Baruchel]] \u2013 Hiccup Horrendous Haddock III, the awkward son of Stoick the Vast.<ref name=cast>\"Viking-Sized Cast\", ''How to Train Your Dragon'' Blu-ray</ref> \n* [[America Ferrera]] \u2013 Astrid Hofferson, Hiccup's fellow student in dragon training and his love interest. \n* [[Gerard Butler]] \u2013 Stoick the Vast, the [[Tribal chief|chieftain]] of Berk and Hiccup's father.<ref name=cast/>\n* [[Craig Ferguson]] \u2013 Gobber the Belch, Berk's blacksmith, a close friend of Stoick's and teacher of the tribe's young dragon-training recruits.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.moviesonline.ca/movienews_17051.html |title=Gerard Butler Interview, Movies Online |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090722103059/http://www.moviesonline.ca/movienews_17051.html |archive-date=July 22, 2009 }}</ref><ref name=cast/>\n* [[Christopher Mintz-Plasse]] \u2013 Fishlegs Ingerman, an enthusiastic youth knowledgeable in dragon lore which he often relates in [[role-playing game]] style.<ref>{{cite news|title=Nadder, Zippleback and Gronckle Lessons From 'How to Train Your Dragon' |work=Lineboil |date=February 17, 2010 |url=http://lineboil.com/2010/02/nadder-zippleback-and-gronckle-lessons-from-how-to-train-your-dragon |access-date=February 17, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100223003151/http://lineboil.com/2010/02/nadder-zippleback-and-gronckle-lessons-from-how-to-train-your-dragon/ |archive-date=February 23, 2010}}</ref><ref name=cast/>\n* [[Jonah Hill]] \u2013 Snotlout Jorgenson, one of Hiccup's dragon-training classmates.

In the film, Toothless is an injured Night Fury, the rarest species of all dragons, far faster, aerodynamic and more powerful than the other species, and is large enough to serve as a flying mount for both Hiccup and Astrid. The filmmakers hired cinematographer [[Roger Deakins]] (known for frequently collaborating with [[the Coen brothers]]) as a visual consultant to help them with lighting and overall look of the film and to \"add a live-action feel\".<ref name=\"devusatoday\"/> Extensive research was done to depict both flight, as the directors knew they would be the biggest draw of the film's 3D effects, and fire, given animation could break away from the limitations seen in live-action films, where [[propane]] flames are usual due to being easier to extinguish. The dragons' designers made sure to create animals that were comical and also innovative compared to other dragon fiction. Toothless in particular tried to combine various dragon traits in a [[black panther]]-inspired design, that also had large ears and eyes to convey emotion better.<ref name=tech>\"The Technical Artistry of 'Dragon'\", ''How to Train Your Dragon'' Blu-ray</ref>\n\nThe directors made sure to cash in the improvisation abilities of the secondary cast\u2014Christopher Mintz-Plasse, Jonah Hill, Kristen Wiig and T.J Miller\u2014by frequently bringing them together in the recording sessions.<ref name=cast/>\n{{clear}}\n\n== Music ==\n{{Main|How to Train Your Dragon: Music from the Motion Picture}}\n[[John Powell (film composer)|John Powell]] returned to DreamWorks Animation to score ''How to Train Your Dragon'', making it his sixth collaboration with the studio, following ''[[Antz]]'', ''[[The Road to El Dorado]]'', ''[[Chicken Run]]'', ''[[Shrek]]'', and his previous score for ''[[Kung Fu Panda (film)|Kung Fu Panda]]'' (all of which he scored with either [[Harry Gregson-Williams]] and/or [[Hans Zimmer]]). Powell composed an orchestral score, combining bombastic brass with loud percussion and soothing strings, while also using exotic Scottish and Irish tones with instruments like the [[penny whistle]] and [[bagpipes]]. Additionally, Icelandic singer [[J\u00f3n \u00de\u00f3r Birgisson|J\u00f3nsi]] wrote and performed the song \"Sticks & Stones\" for the film. The score was released by [[Var\u00e8se Sarabande]] on March 23, 2010.\n\nOverall, the score was well received by film score critics.
