The film was also nominated for eight awards at the [[6th Irish Film and Television Awards|2009]] [[Irish Film and Television Awards|IFTAs]], winning six at the event.\n\nThe film stars Fassbender as [[Bobby Sands]], the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army]] (IRA) member who led the second IRA hunger strike and participated in the [[Dirty protest|no wash protest]] (led by [[Brendan Hughes|Brendan \"The Dark\" Hughes]]) in which [[Irish republican]] prisoners tried to regain political status after it had been revoked by the British government in 1976. It outlines events in the [[Maze (HM Prison)|Maze Prison]] in the period leading up to the hunger strike and its aftermath.\n\n==Plot==\nPrison officer Raymond Lohan prepares to leave for work, cleaning his wounded knuckles and checking his car for bombs. At the Maze prison, he puts on his uniform and ignores his comrades.\n\nA new [[Provisional Irish Republican Army|IRA]] inmate, Davey Gillen, is admitted and categorised as a \"non-conforming prisoner\" for his refusal to wear the prison uniform. He is sent to his cell naked except for a blanket. His cellmate, Gerry Campbell, has smeared the walls with excrement from floor to ceiling as part of the [[dirty protest|no wash protest]]. Gerry's girlfriend sneaks a radio in by wrapping it and storing it in her vagina.\n\nPrison officers forcibly and violently remove the prisoners from their cells and beat them before pinning them down to cut their long hair and beards, grown as part of the no-wash protest. The prisoners resist, with prisoner Bobby Sands spitting into Lohan's face. He responds by punching Sands in the face and then swings again, only to miss and punch the wall, causing his knuckles to bleed. He cuts Sands' hair and beard; the men throw Sands in the bathtub and scrub him clean before hauling him away again.\n\nLater, the prisoners are taken out of their cells and given second-hand civilian clothing. The guards snicker as they hand the clothes to the prisoners, who respond, after Sands' initial action, by tearing up the clothes and wrecking their cells. A large number of riot police enter the prison on a truck. The prisoners are hauled from their cells and forced to [[running the gauntlet|run the gauntlet]] between the lines of riot police, during which they are beaten with batons. Lohan and several of his colleagues then probe prisoners' rectums and mouths, using the same pair of latex gloves for each man.\n\nLohan visits his catatonic mother in a retirement home. He is shot in the back of the head by an IRA assassin and dies slumped onto his mother's lap.\n\nSands is visited by [[Priesthood in the Catholic Church|Father]] Dominic Moran and discusses the morality of a [[hunger strike]]. Sands tells the priest about a trip to [[County Donegal|Donegal]] where he and his friends found a [[foal]] by a stream. It had cut itself on the rocks and broken a back leg. Sands tells the priest that he drowned the foal and that although he got into trouble for it, he knew he had done the right thing by ending the animal's suffering. He says he knows what he is doing and what it will do to him but refuses to stand by and do nothing.\n\nSometime later, Sands is well into his hunger strike, suffering from weeping sores, kidney failure, low blood pressure, and stomach ulcers. While Sands lies in a bath, a large orderly comes in to give his usual orderly a break. The orderly sits next to the tub and shows Sands his knuckles, which are tattooed with the letters \"[[Ulster Defence Association|UDA]]\". Sands tries to stand on his own and eventually does so with all his strength, staring defiantly at the UDA orderly but crumples to the floor with no strength left to stand. The orderly carries him to his room. Sands' parents stay for his final days, his mother being at his side when he dies, 66 days after beginning the strike.\n\nA textual epilogue reveals that Sands was elected to the United Kingdom Parliament as [[Member of Parliament|MP]] for [[Fermanagh and South Tyrone (UK Parliament constituency)|Fermanagh and South Tyrone]] while he was on the hunger strike. Nine other men died with him during the seven-month strike before it was called off, and paramilitaries killed 16 prison officers during the protests. Shortly afterward, the British government conceded in one form or another to virtually all of the prisoners' five demands despite never officially granting them political status.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Michael Fassbender]] as [[Bobby Sands]]\n** Ciaran Flynn as 12-year-old Bobby\n* [[Liam Cunningham]] as Father Dominic Moran\n* [[Liam McMahon]] as Gerry Campbell\n* [[Stuart Graham (actor)|Stuart Graham]] as Raymond Lohan\n* [[Brian Milligan]] as Davey Gillen\n* Laine Megaw as Mrs Lohan\n* [[Karen Hassan]] as Gerry's girlfriend\n* Frank McCusker as the Governor\n* [[Lalor Roddy]] as William\n* Helen Madden as Mrs Sands\n* Des McAleer as Mr Sands\n* Geoff Gatt as Bearded man\n* Rory Mullen as Priest\n* [[Ben Peel]] as Riot Prison Officer Stephen Graves\n* Helena Bereen as Raymond's mother\n* Paddy Jenkins as Hitman\n* Billy Clarke as Chief Medical Officer\n* [[BJ Hogg|B.J.

After meeting with a nutritionist, he settled on a diet of berries, nuts, and sardines, and underwent periodic medical checks. In an interview with ''The Telegraph'', Fassbender said that he skipped, did yoga, and walked four and a half miles a day, but also added that he had difficulty sleeping, and stopped seeing friends. He also said that the experience made him feel \"grateful\" and \"strong\".<ref name=\"telegraph\">{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/3562289/Michael-Fassbender-on-playing-Bobby-Sands-in-Hunger.html|title=Michael Fassbender on playing Bobby Sands in Hunger|newspaper=The Telegraph|author=Garrat, Sherryl|date=18 October 2008|access-date=15 January 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe film is also notable for an unbroken 17-minute shot, in which a priest played by [[Liam Cunningham]] tries to talk [[Bobby Sands]] out of his protest. In it, the camera remains in the same position for the duration of the entire shot. To prepare for the scene, Cunningham moved into [[Michael Fassbender]]'s apartment for a time while they practiced the scene between twelve and fifteen times a day.
