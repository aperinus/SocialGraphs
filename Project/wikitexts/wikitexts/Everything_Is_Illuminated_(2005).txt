These guides have been escorting wealthy Americans in search of their roots for decades. They are generally not very knowledgeable about the subject of finding Jews, and usually just attempt to scam them by taking them on long journeys. However, after hearing Jonathan's compelling story, they decide they actually want to help him.\n\nAlong the way in [[Volhynia]], as they travel in search of the shtetl in the region around [[Lutsk]], they have a series of misadventures, many of them humorous and based on the culture shock Jonathan experiences as an American tourist in Ukraine.\n\nTraveling through much of rural western Ukraine, the three men eventually find Augustine's sister, Lista ([[Laryssa Lauret]]). She lives by herself in a house in the midst of a great sunflower field, isolated from technology and from news of the outside world. Lista tells them that Augustine was killed by Nazi soldiers after her father refused to spit on the Torah. And she leads them to the site where the town had been.\n\nThe next night Alex's grandfather quietly kills himself. Through flashbacks, it was revealed he was Jewish. During the [[Einsatzgruppen|massacre]] of the Jews of his town in the [[The Holocaust in Ukraine|Holocaust]], he was shot and thrown into a mass grave. But hours later, he regained consciousness and crawled out of the pit alive, and managed to survive the war himself by hiding his identity as a Jew. He abandoned this identity permanently, symbolically walking away from it.\n\nJonathan returns home to America after saying farewell to Alex, to whom he has grown close. They strike up a correspondence.\n\nBoth Jonathan and Alex sprinkle soil gathered from the site of the massacre on their respective grandfathers' graves. Alex's grandfather is given a Jewish tombstone.\n\n==Music==\nThe score for ''Everything Is Illuminated'' features eight original tracks composed by [[Paul Cantelon]],<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THSJ4DZAVTc ''Everything is Illuminated'' Soundtrack]</ref> along with songs by [[Russia]]n [[ska punk]] band [[Leningrad (band)|Leningrad]], [[Arkady Severny]], [[Cs\u00f3kolom]], [[Tin Hat Trio]], and [[Gogol Bordello]], whose lead singer [[Eugene H\u00fctz]] plays Alex. The band members of Gogol Bordello play the band in the train station where the character Alex has come to meet his US client, Jonathan Foer. [[DeVotchKa]]'s single \"How It Ends\" is featured in the trailer, but not in the official soundtrack.\n\n==Critical response==\n''American Chronicle'' counted the film among the \"rare films that encapsulate the emotion of discovery and drama with humor\",<ref>{{cite news|last=Simpson|first=Mary Anne|title=A Review of the Movie: Everything is Illuminated|url=http://www.americanchronicle.com/articles/19430|date=19 January 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120813135337/http://www.americanchronicle.com/articles/view/19430|archive-date=13 August 2012|access-date=2016-10-03|work=American Chronicle}}</ref> while ''[[Time Out (company)|Time Out New York]]'' called it Liev Schreiber's \"unbelievably assured debut as a director\".<ref>Rothkopf, Joshua (28 September 2005). \"[https://www.timeout.com/us/film/everything-is-illuminated Everything Is Illuminated]\" [film review].
