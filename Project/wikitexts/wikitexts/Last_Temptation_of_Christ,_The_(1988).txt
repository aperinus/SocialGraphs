Written by [[Paul Schrader]] with uncredited rewrites from Scorsese and [[Jay Cocks]], it is an [[film adaptation|adaptation]] of [[Nikos Kazantzakis]]' controversial 1955 [[The Last Temptation of Christ (novel)|novel of the same name]]. The film, starring [[Willem Dafoe]], [[Harvey Keitel]], [[Barbara Hershey]], [[Andre Gregory]], [[Harry Dean Stanton]] and [[David Bowie]], was shot entirely in [[Morocco]].\n\nThe film depicts the life of [[Jesus Christ]] and his struggle with various forms of temptation including fear, doubt, depression, reluctance and lust. The book and the film depict Christ being tempted by imagining himself engaged in sexual activities, which has caused outrage from some [[Christians]]. It includes a disclaimer stating \"This film is not based on the [[Gospel]]s, but upon the fictional exploration of the eternal spiritual conflict.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://stephenlawson.wordpress.com/2012/07/25/a-theological-critique-of-scorseses-the-last-temptation-of-christ/|title=A Theological Critique of Scorsese's The Last Temptation of Christ|last=stephen|date=July 26, 2012|website=Logos & Ekklesia|language=en|access-date=July 11, 2019|archive-date=May 6, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210506064016/https://stephenlawson.wordpress.com/2012/07/25/a-theological-critique-of-scorseses-the-last-temptation-of-christ/|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nLike the novel it was based on, the film generated controversy at the time of its release from Christian religious groups, who took issue with its departures from the gospel narratives. It received positive reviews from critics and some religious leaders, and Scorsese received a nomination for the [[Academy Award for Best Director]]. Hershey's performance as Mary Magdalene earned her a nomination for the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress \u2013 Motion Picture|Golden Globe for Best Supporting Actress]]. [[Peter Gabriel]]'s music score also received acclaim, including a nomination for the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Original Score]]. Dafoe's performance was praised, with some thinking he should have been nominated for [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]]. In stark contrast, Keitel's performance was not well received and he was nominated for [[Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Supporting Actor|Worst Supporting Actor]] at the [[Golden Raspberry Awards]].\n\n==Plot==\n[[Jesus]] of Nazareth, a [[Carpentry|carpenter]] in [[Roman Empire|Roman]]-occupied [[Judea]], is torn between his own desires and his knowledge of [[God]]'s plan for him. His friend [[Judas Iscariot]] is sent to kill him for collaborating with the Romans to crucify Jewish rebels, but suspects that Jesus is the [[Messiah]] and asks him to lead a liberation war against the Romans. While Jesus assures him that his message is love of mankind, Judas warns him not to harm the rebellion.\n\nJesus starts preaching after saving prostitute [[Mary Magdalene]] from a [[stoning]] and being baptized by [[John the Baptist]]. He acquires [[Disciple (Christianity)|disciples]], some who want freedom from the Romans while Jesus maintains people should tend to matters of the spirit. Jesus goes into the desert to test his connection to God, where he resists temptation by [[Satan]]. Returning from the desert, Jesus is nursed back to health by [[Martha]] and [[Mary of Bethany]], who encourage him to marry and have children. \n\nAfter performing miracles, including raising [[Lazarus of Bethany|Lazarus]] from the dead, Jesus's ministry reaches [[Jerusalem]], where he chases out money lenders from the temple. He begins bleeding from his hands, which he recognizes as a sign that he must die on the cross to bring salvation to mankind and instructs Judas to give him to the Romans. Jesus convenes his disciples for Passover seder, whereupon Judas leads a contingent of soldiers to arrest Jesus in the garden of [[Gethsemane]]. [[Pontius Pilate]] tells Jesus that he must be put to death as he represents a threat to the Roman Empire; he is subsequently [[Flagellation|flogged]], mocked and taken to be [[Crucifixion|crucified]].\n\nWhile on the cross, a young lady who claims to be Jesus's [[guardian angel]] tells him that, while he is the Son of God, he is not the Messiah and that God is pleased with him and wants him to be happy. She brings him down off the cross and, invisible to others, takes him to Mary Magdalene, whom he marries. They live a happy life when she abruptly dies and Jesus is consoled by his angel, going on to start a family with [[Mary, sister of Lazarus|Mary]] and [[Martha]], the sisters of Lazarus. As an older man, Jesus encounters the apostle [[Paul the Apostle|Paul]] preaching about the Messiah and tries to tell him that he is the man about whom Paul has been preaching. Paul repudiates him, saying that even if Jesus had not died on the cross, his message was the truth, and nothing would stop him from proclaiming that. Jesus debates him, stating that salvation cannot be founded on lies.\n\nNear the end of his life, with Jerusalem in the throes of rebellion, an elderly dying Jesus calls his former disciples to his bed. When Judas comes he reveals Jesus's guardian angel is actually Satan, who tricked him into believing he did not have to give himself up to save the world. Crawling back through the burning city, Jesus reaches the site of his crucifixion and begs God to let him fulfill his purpose, stating \"I ''want'' to be the Messiah!\" Jesus then finds himself once more on the cross, having overcome the \"last temptation\" of escaping death, being married and raising a family, and the ensuing disaster that would have consequently encompassed mankind. Jesus cries out \"It is accomplished!\" and dies.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col begin}}\n* [[Willem Dafoe]] as [[Jesus]]\n* [[Harvey Keitel]] as [[Judas Iscariot]]\n* [[Barbara Hershey]] as [[Mary Magdalene]]\n* [[Harry Dean Stanton]] as [[Paul of Tarsus|Saul/Paul of Tarsus]]\n* [[David Bowie]] as [[Pontius Pilate]]\n* [[Steve Shill]] as [[Centurion (Roman army)|Centurion]]\n* [[Verna Bloom]] as [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary, mother of Jesus]]\n* [[Roberts Blossom]] as Aged Master\n* [[Barry Miller (actor)|Barry Miller]] as Jeroboam\n* [[Gary Basaraba]] as [[Saint Andrew|Andrew]]\n* [[Irvin Kershner]] as [[Zebedee]]\n* [[Victor Argo]] as [[Saint Peter|Peter]]\n* [[Paul Herman]] as [[Philip the Apostle|Philip]]\n* [[John Lurie]] as [[James, son of Zebedee|James]]\n* [[Michael Been]] as [[John the Apostle|John]]\n* [[Leo Burmester]] as [[Bartholomew the Apostle|Nathaniel]]\n* [[Andre Gregory]] as [[John the Baptist]]\n* [[Tomas Arana]] as [[Lazarus of Bethany|Lazarus]]\n* [[Alan Rosenberg]] as [[Thomas the Apostle|Thomas]]\n* [[Nehemiah Persoff]] as Rabbi\n* [[Peter Berling]] as Beggar\n* [[Leo Marks]] as Voice of [[Satan]]\n* Juliette Caton as Girl Angel\n* [[Martin Scorsese]] (''uncredited'') as [[Isaiah]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\nScorsese had wanted to make a [[Film adaptation|film version]] of Jesus' life since childhood. While he was directing [[Barbara Hershey]] in the 1972 film ''[[Boxcar Bertha]]'', she gave him a copy of the Kazantzakis novel. Scorsese optioned the novel in the late 1970s, and he gave it to [[Paul Schrader]] to adapt. ''The Last Temptation of Christ'' was originally to be Scorsese's follow-up to ''[[The King of Comedy (film)|The King of Comedy]]''; production was slated to begin in 1983 for [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]], with a budget of about $14 million and shot on location in [[Israel]]. The original cast included [[Aidan Quinn]] as Jesus, [[Sting (musician)|Sting]] as Pontius Pilate, [[Ray Davies]] as Judas Iscariot,<ref>Revealed in an interview with Mark Lawson on ''Front Row'', [[BBC Radio 4]], September 23, 2008.</ref> and [[Vanity (performer)|Vanity]] as Mary Magdalene. Management at Paramount and its then parent company, [[Gulf+Western]] grew uneasy due to the ballooning budget for the picture and protest letters received from religious groups. The project went into [[Turnaround (filmmaking)|turnaround]] and was finally canceled in December 1983. Scorsese went on to make ''[[After Hours (film)|After Hours]]'' instead.\n\nIn 1986, [[Universal Studios]] became interested in the project. Scorsese offered to shoot the film in 58 days for $7 million,<ref name=\"Twenty-Five\"/> and Universal eventually [[greenlight]]ed the production as Scorsese agreed to direct a more mainstream film for the studio in the future (it eventually resulted in ''[[Cape Fear (1991 film)|Cape Fear]]'').<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.carseywolf.ucsb.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/MIP_TomPollock_Interview.pdf |title=Archived copy |website=www.carseywolf.ucsb.edu |access-date=12 January 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211003040133/https://www.carseywolf.ucsb.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/MIP_TomPollock_Interview.pdf |archive-date=3 October 2021 |url-status=dead}}</ref> Critic and screenwriter [[Jay Cocks]] worked with Scorsese to revise Schrader's script. [[Aidan Quinn]] passed on the role of Jesus, and Scorsese recast [[Willem Dafoe]] in the part. [[Sting (musician)|Sting]] also passed on the role of Pilate, with the role being recast with [[David Bowie]]. [[Principal photography]] began in October 1987. The location shoot in Morocco (a first for Scorsese) was difficult, and the difficulties were compounded by the hurried schedule. \"We worked in a state of emergency,\" Scorsese recalled. Scenes had to be improvised and worked out on the set with little deliberation, leading Scorsese to develop a minimalist aesthetic for the film. Shooting wrapped by December 25, 1987.\n\n==Music==\nThe film's musical [[soundtrack]], composed by [[Peter Gabriel]], received a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Original Score|Golden Globe Award nomination for Best Original Score - Motion Picture]] in 1988 and was released on CD with the title ''[[Passion (Peter Gabriel album)|Passion]]'', which won a Grammy in 1990 for Best New Age Album. The film's score itself helped to popularize [[world music]]. Gabriel subsequently [[Compilation album|compiled]] an album called ''[[Passion \u2013 Sources]]'', including additional material by various musicians that inspired him in composing the soundtrack, or which he sampled for the soundtrack. The original scores brought together many international artists including Pakistani Musician and vocalist [[Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan]], Egyptian Kanun player Abdul Aziz, Turkish [[Ney|Ney flute]] player [[Kudsi Erguner|Kudsi Erg\u00fcner]], \u00a0Armenian Doudouk players Antranik Askarian and Vatche Housepian.\n\n==Release==\nThe film opened on August 12, 1988.<ref name=Kelly>Kelly, M.
