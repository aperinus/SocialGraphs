Starring [[Bow Wow (rapper)|Lil' Bow Wow]], [[Morris Chestnut]], [[Jonathan Lipnicki]], [[Robert Forster]], [[Crispin Glover]] and [[Eugene Levy]], the film follows an orphan who gets basketball talents after finding an old pair of sneakers that once belonged to [[Michael Jordan]].\n\nIt was produced by NBA Productions, and features cameo appearances by NBA players. The film was released on July 3, 2002, by [[20th Century Fox]], three years after Jordan left the [[Chicago Bulls]], one year before Jordan retired for the third (and last) time from the [[NBA]], and during his playing career with the [[Washington Wizards]] (Jordan's first retirement was 1993).\n\nDespite receiving mixed reviews from critics, ''Like Mike'' was a moderate box office success, grossing $62.3 million worldwide against a $30 million budget. In later years, the film became a fan favorite among basketball fans.<ref>{{Cite web |title=How Bow Wow Energized a New Generation of NBA Fans with Like Mike |url=https://www.gq.com/story/like-mike-20th-anniversary-bow-wow |access-date=July 21, 2022 |website=Rolling Stone}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nCalvin Cambridge and his two best friends, Murph and Reg Stevens, live in an [[orphanage]]. Murph is the youngest of the trio, and has a very close bond with Calvin. At night they all have to sell chocolate for the troublesome orphanage director, Stan Bittleman, after each home game of the [[National Basketball Association|NBA]] team, the [[Los Angeles]] Knights (a parody of the [[Los Angeles Clippers]]). Calvin meets the team's coach, who is impressed by Calvin's knowledge of basketball and honesty about the chocolates, and offers Calvin tickets for the next game.\n\nInside a [[Charity shop|thrift store]] donation box, Calvin finds a pair of old sneakers with the initials \"MJ\" written on them; once worn by [[Michael Jordan]]. A jealous bully named Ox steals the sneakers and throws them onto an overhead power line. When Calvin tries to retrieve them that night during a rainstorm, he is shocked by a lightning bolt.\n\nCalvin and his friends attend the basketball game between the Knights and the [[Minnesota Timberwolves]]. After the second quarter ends, the team's star player, Tracy Reynolds, prepares for a halftime contest. Calvin's ticket number is called and he goes one on one with Tracy. Calvin ends the contest with a [[slam dunk]] after bouncing the ball off the backboard. After a long moment of stunned silence, Calvin receives a standing ovation from Reg and the crowd. Calvin is signed to a one-day contract by the Knights and prepares for his first game with them, but realizes that he is not there to play. When the Knights play the [[San Antonio Spurs]] they start losing badly and Coach Wagner decides to let Calvin play in the fourth quarter. Calvin leads a comeback against the Spurs and they win, leading to Calvin getting a season contract. Reynolds becomes his mentor since Calvin is still a minor. Calvin brings teamwork to the Knights and makes them one of the best teams in the league.\n\nTracy starts to respect Calvin after he gets himself into trouble when making sure that Tracy does not miss his curfew. Bittleman signs a contract with the team that all of Calvin's money will go to him until Calvin is eighteen, or adopted. When the second option is about to become true, Bittleman grows desperate, steals Calvin's shoes and bets $100,000 against the Knights. After the kids convince Ox and his cohorts that Bittleman is selfish, Ox takes the shoes out of Bittleman's safe. The kids head to the arena with Calvin's sneakers. Bittleman escapes and sends goons after Calvin in a failed attempt to retrieve the shoes.\n\nAfter the 3rd quarter ends with [[Vince Carter]] and the [[Toronto Raptors]] routing the Knights, 80-59, Calvin makes it back to the arena with the shoes. In the fourth and final quarter of the last regular season game, Calvin is put into the game by the coach and the Knights start to make a comeback. After a pile on towards the end of the game, Calvin's shoes are ruined with the Knights trailing the Raptors, 103-102. Without the shoes, and wanting to be a normal child, Calvin tells the team that, regardless of whether or not the Knights make the playoffs, it will be his last game. In the final play, Calvin manages to pump fake to get Carter to jump and pass the ball to Tracy. Tracy makes the game-winning shot at the final buzzer, and the Knights defeat the Raptors, 104-103, to clinch the Knights' first playoff appearance.\n\nAfter going back to his orphanage, Calvin and Murph get adopted by Tracy, and Reg by a different family, though they stay in touch. Bittleman, not having the money to pay off the bet, goes into hiding (presumably to either avoid getting killed by his goons, or to avoid getting arrested by the [[Los Angeles Police Department]]), and the orphanage is now sponsored by the Knights.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{Div col start}}\n* [[Bow Wow (rapper)|Bow Wow]] as Calvin Cambridge\n* [[Jonathan Lipnicki]] as Murph\n* [[Brenda Song]] as Reg Stevens\n* [[Morris Chestnut]] as Tracy Reynolds\n* [[Eugene Levy]] as Frank Bernard\n* [[Crispin Glover]] as Stan Bittleman\n* [[Jesse Plemons]] as Ox\n* [[Robert Forster]] as Coach Wagner\n* Julius Charles Ritter as Marlon\n* [[Anne Meara]] as Sister Theresa\n* [[Fred Armisen]] as New Age Dad\n* [[Julie Brown]] as New Age Mom\n* [[Vanessa Estelle Williams|Vanessa Williams]] as Pharmacist\n* [[Reginald VelJohnson]] as Mr. Boyd \n* [[Valarie Pettiford]] as  Mrs. Boyd\n* [[Reggie Theus]] and [[Geoff Witcher]] as the Knights Announcers\n* Roger Morrissey as Marvin Joad\n* [[Tucker Smallwood]]\n* [[Sandra Prosper]] as Janet\n\n=== NBA players ===\n* [[Vince Carter]]\n* [[Michael Finley]]\n* [[Steve Francis]]\n* [[Allen Iverson]]\n* [[Jason Kidd]]\n* [[Desmond Mason]]\n* [[Alonzo Mourning]]\n* [[Tracy McGrady]]\n* [[Steve Nash]]\n* [[Dirk Nowitzki]]\n* [[Gary Payton]]\n* [[Jason Richardson]]\n* [[David Robinson (basketball)|David Robinson]]\n* [[Gerald Wallace]]\n* [[Rasheed Wallace]]\n* [[Chris Webber]]\n\n=== NBA reporters ===\n* [[Tom Tolbert]]\n* [[Hannah Storm]]\n* [[Ahmad Rashad]]\n* [[Kenny Mayne]]\n* [[Rich Eisen]]\n* [[Pat Croce]]\n{{Div col end}}\n\n==Reception==\n===Box office===\n''Like Mike'' grossed $51.4 million in North America and $10.8 million overseas for a total worldwide gross of $62.3 million, against its budget of $30 million.<ref name=\"boxofficemojo1\"/> The film opened fifth at the box office with a three-day gross of $12.2 million from 2,410 theaters, and $19 million over its five-day opening.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/weekend/chart/?yr=2002&wknd=27&p=.htm |title=Weekend Box Office Results for July 5-7, 2002 |publisher=Box Office Mojo |access-date=2015-05-25}}</ref> The film was released in the [[United Kingdom]] on December 13, 2002, and opened on #4 with \u00a3246,169.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.25thframe.co.uk/charts/chart.php?chart=20021213|title=UK Weekend Box Office 13th December 2002 - 15th December 2002|publisher=www.25thframe.co.uk|access-date=9 June 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Critical response===\nOn [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film has an approval rating of 57% based on 97 reviews, and an average rating of 5.5/10.
