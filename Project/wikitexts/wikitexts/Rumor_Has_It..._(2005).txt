The concept of the screenplay by [[Ted Griffin]] is that a woman learns that her mother and grandmother may be the inspiration for the 1963 novel ''[[The Graduate (novel)|The Graduate]]'' by [[Charles Webb (author)|Charles Webb]]. The film received negative reviews from critics and was a box office disappointment, grossing $88.9 million against its $70 million budget.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1997, Sarah Huttinger, an obituary and wedding announcement writer for ''[[The New York Times]]'', travels to [[Pasadena, California]], for her sister Annie's wedding, accompanied by her fianc\u00e9 Jeff Daly. When Sarah tells her grandmother, Katharine Richelieu, that she is unsure about getting married, Katharine lets slip that her late daughter, Sarah's mother Jocelyn, ran off to [[Cabo San Lucas]] a week before her own wedding.\n\nSarah visits her mother's best friend, Aunt Mitsy, who confirms that Jocelyn spent time with their prep school classmate Beau Burroughs the week before her wedding to Sarah's father Earl, and that Beau was friends with [[Charles Webb (author)|Charles Webb]], the author of the novel ''[[The Graduate (novel)|The Graduate]]''.\n\nJeff points out Sarah's parents were married just short of nine months before her birth, leading her to wonder if Beau might really be her biological father. Sarah also accuses her grandmother of being the inspiration for Mrs. Robinson, the older character who seduced the young man in ''The Graduate'', who later ran away with Mrs. Robinson's daughter.\n\nAfter the wedding, Sarah decides to fly to San Francisco, where Beau, now a highly successful and very wealthy [[Silicon Valley]] Internet wizard, is giving a speech. She meets him; and he admits to sleeping with her mother and grandmother, but assures Sarah he couldn't be her father because he is sterile after having suffered blunt [[testicular]] trauma while playing a soccer game in high school. The two go out for drinks, and the following morning Sarah wakes up in Beau's bed in his [[Half Moon Bay]] home{{snd}}the third generation in her family to have sex with Beau.\n\nAlthough guilt-stricken by her behavior, Sarah allows Beau to convince her to be his date at a charity ball, where she meets Beau's son Blake. Beau explains his wife wanted a biological child and was artificially inseminated with a sperm donor to become pregnant. Mollified, Sarah kisses Beau and is caught by Jeff, who has returned to California to find her after not hearing from her since she met Beau. An argument ensues and Jeff leaves her.\n\nDejected, Sarah returns to visit Katharine, who flies into a rage when she learns Beau has slept with her granddaughter. The two learn Annie suffered an anxiety attack while flying to her honeymoon and wants to talk to Sarah. Sarah tells her sister about the sexual relationship three generations of Richelieu/Huttinger women have had with Beau. She reassures Annie she truly is in love with her husband, Scott, and in doing so, realizes she's ready to marry Jeff.\n\nIt is also revealed that Earl was the one who accidentally caused Beau's testicular trauma. This makes Beau somewhat nervous to be around Earl, though Katherine is quite pleased by the revelation. Earl reveals to Sarah he always knew about Jocelyn and Beau's affair. Jocelyn returned to Earl because she loved him and he was someone with whom she could build a life. On the night she returned, Sarah was conceived. This explained the slightly early timing between her parents' wedding and her own birth.\n\nDetermined to win Jeff back, Sarah returns to New York City and tells her fianc\u00e9 about her feelings. They reconcile on the condition that if they ever have a daughter, she will not be allowed anywhere near Beau. The film ends with Sarah and Jeff's wedding.\n\n==Cast==\n<!--- Cast and order per tombstone opening credits, roles per closing credits scroll --->\n{{castlist|\n* [[Jennifer Aniston]] as Sarah Huttinger\n* [[Kevin Costner]] as Beau Burroughs\n* [[Shirley MacLaine]] as Katharine Richelieu\n* [[Mark Ruffalo]] as Jeff Daly\n* [[Richard Jenkins]] as Earl Huttinger\n* [[Christopher McDonald]] as Roger McManus\n* [[Steve Sandvoss]] as Scott\n* [[Mena Suvari]] as Annie Huttinger\n* [[Mike Vogel]] as Blake Burroughs\n}}\n\nIn addition, [[Kathy Bates]] appears, uncredited, in the role of Aunt Mitsy, while [[George Hamilton (actor)|George Hamilton]] has a brief uncredited non-speaking cameo as himself.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Leo|first=Vince|date=May 14, 2006|title=Rumor Has It review (2005)|url=http://www.qwipster.net/rumorhasit.htm|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060613223817/http://www.qwipster.net/rumorhasit.htm|archive-date=June 13, 2006|access-date=2021-11-15|website=Qwipster's Movie Reviews}}</ref>\n\n==Production==\nScreenwriter [[Ted Griffin]] was the initial director, but problems arose soon after [[principal photography]] began on July 21, 2004.

O. Scott]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' said, \"I suppose ''Rumor Has It'' could be worse, though at the moment I'm at a loss to say just how.
