S. Anderson]] and starring [[Matthew Macfadyen]], [[Logan Lerman]], [[Ray Stevenson]], [[Milla Jovovich]], [[Luke Evans (actor)|Luke Evans]], [[Mads Mikkelsen]], [[Orlando Bloom]], and [[Christoph Waltz]]. It is based on [[Alexandre Dumas]]'s [[The Three Musketeers|1844 novel of the same title]] with [[Cyberpunk derivatives#Clockpunk|clock-punk]] elements.<ref>{{cite book |title=International Film Guide 2012 |first=Ian Hayden |last=Smith |year= 2012 |isbn= 978-1908215017 |page= 125 }}</ref>\n\nThe film was released on 1 September 2011 in Germany, 12 October 2011 in the United Kingdom and France and 21 October 2011 in the United States, Canada and Australia. Upon its release, it grossed $132 million against a production budget of $75 million and received negative critical reaction. Critics praised its action sequences, score, the performances of Macfadyen and Mikkelsen, and visual style but criticised its writing, direction and characters.\n\n==Plot==\nIn [[Venice]], the [[Musketeer#Musketeers in France|musketeers]] [[Athos (fictional character)|Athos]], [[Porthos]], and [[Aramis]], with the help of [[Milady de Winter]], steal airship blueprints made by [[Leonardo da Vinci]]. However, they are betrayed by Milady, who incapacitates them and sells the blueprints to the [[George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham|Duke of Buckingham]].\n\nA year later, [[Charles de Batz de Castelmore d'Artagnan|d'Artagnan]] leaves his village in [[Gascony]] for [[Paris]] in hopes of becoming a musketeer as his father was, only to learn that they were disbanded. At a rural bar, he challenges [[Comte de Rochefort|Captain Rochefort]], leader of [[Cardinal Richelieu]]'s guard, to a duel after being insulted by him, but Rochefort merely shoots him while he's distracted. Once in Paris, d'Artagnan separately encounters Athos, Porthos and Aramis and, accidentally offending all three, schedules separate duels with each. Athos brings Porthos and Aramis to the duel as his seconds, causing d'Artagnan to realise their true identities. Richelieu's guards arrive to apprehend them, but, inspired by d'Artagnan, the musketeers fight together and win. All four are summoned before the young [[Louis XIII of France|King Louis XIII]] and Richelieu urges him to execute them, but [[Anne of Austria|Queen Anne]] is impressed by their bravery and the king decorates them instead.\n\nRichelieu instructs Milady, now his accomplice, to plant false love letters among Queen Anne's possessions, steal her diamond necklace, and take it to the [[Tower of London]] in order to frame her as having an affair with Buckingham, which would force King Louis to execute her and declare war on [[England]]. At this point, the people would demand a more experienced leader: Richelieu himself. In order to secure her own position, Milady demands that Richelieu declare in a written authorisation that she is working on behalf of France.\n\nThe false letters are found and given to King Louis, who is advised by Richelieu to set up a ball at which Queen Anne would be forced to wear the necklace. If she doesn't, then her affair is real, and there will be war. Queen Anne's [[lady-in-waiting]] Constance Bonacieux discovers Richelieu's plan and pleads with the musketeers to stop him. They follow Milady and Buckingham to [[London]], while Constance is captured by Rochefort for helping the musketeers to escape from him.\n\nIn London, Milady tells Buckingham the musketeers have arrived to take revenge on him and exposes to him all their tendencies in battle. D'Artagnan is captured, but he is in fact acting as a decoy following the plan Milady would have ''expected'' the Musketeers to follow, allowing his associates to hijack Buckingham's airship and rescue him. Milady's getaway [[coachman]] reveals himself as the musketeers' manservant Planchet and delivers her to his masters, who retrieve the necklace from her. Athos prepares to execute Milady for her treachery, but she leaps off the airship, seemingly dying on her own terms.\n\nThe musketeers depart back to Paris, only to be intercepted by Rochefort in a much larger airship, for Milady had given Richelieu copies of da Vinci's blueprints. Rochefort offers to exchange Constance for the necklace, but captures d'Artagnan and mounts an assault as soon as he retrieves the jewels. His superior airship has the upper hand and severely damages the opposing vessel, but the musketeers use the clouds to rally and counterattack. The fight ends when both ships ram each other, crashing onto [[Notre Dame de Paris|Notre Dame]]. On the roof, d'Artagnan challenges and ultimately kills Rochefort, recovering the necklace in the process. Constance is sent ahead to quietly return the necklace to Queen Anne. The musketeers arrive at the ball and, for the sake of King Louis and his people, lie by claiming that Rochefort tried to sabotage an airship that Richelieu built for them, and that they executed him for his treason on Richelieu's permission. To convince the king, Athos presents Milady's authorisation, which the former accepts. Richelieu, satisfied, offers the musketeers a place in his guards, but they refuse, and Richelieu vows revenge.\n\nMeanwhile, Milady is found alive in the [[English Channel]] by Buckingham, who declares his intention to exact revenge. The camera then pulls back to show him advancing towards France with a massive fleet of battleships and airships.\n\n==Cast==\n[[Image:Three Musketeers balcony shot crop.jpg|thumb|right|Behind the scenes image of the filming of the movie.
