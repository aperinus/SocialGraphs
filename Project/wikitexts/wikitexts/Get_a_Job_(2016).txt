The film stars [[Miles Teller]], [[Anna Kendrick]], [[Brandon T. Jackson]], [[Nicholas Braun]], [[Christopher Mintz-Plasse]], [[Marcia Gay Harden]], [[Alison Brie]] and [[Bryan Cranston]].\n\nShot in 2012, the film remained unreleased until March 25, 2016, when it received a [[limited release|limited]] and [[video on demand]] release by [[Lionsgate Premiere]] and [[CBS Films]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lionsgatepublicity.com/theatrical/getajob/|title=Get a Job|publisher=LionsgatePublicity.com|accessdate=February 1, 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nAfter recently graduating from college, [[millennial]] Will Davis is set to work in video production for ''[[LA Weekly]]'' but when he arrives for his first day, he is informed that the position promised to him during an [[internship]] was lost due to downsizing. He is obligated to find another position quickly to appease his parents, success-driven girlfriend Jillian, and to make rent for the house he shares with his three friends: Luke, Ethan, and Charlie.\n\nWill asks his father Roger Davis for money, but Roger reveals that he recently lost the job he had for 30 years. In desperation, Will takes a position as the night manager for a disreputable motel. On his first night, Will allows a [[pimp]] named Skeezy D to use the motel for his [[prostitution ring]] causing him to lose his job when the police bust it. Meanwhile, his slacker roommates also struggle to fulfill their goals, Luke believes he has gained employment as a [[stock trader]] but instead is a poorly treated office clerk, Ethan fails to gain momentum with his questionable \"iStalkU\" [[mobile app]] idea, and [[Cannabis culture|stoner]] Charlie takes an undesirable job as a 6th grade chemistry teacher. Will interviews at a reputable [[Executive search|executive job placement firm]] and impresses the hiring manager, gaining employment as a [[video resume]] creator. Roger meanwhile struggles to find new employment, believing his age is to blame. Will thrives and is soon offered a promotion after gaining the favor of his [[narcissist]]ic manager, Katherine. Jillian loses her job and is forced to move in with Will and his friends.\n\nA video of Skeezy D that Will uploaded to [[YouTube]] goes [[viral video|viral]], attracting the attention of a [[startup company]] who offer him a job. Meanwhile, Luke becomes a stock trader but continues to struggle, Charlie begins coaching the school's basketball team, and Ethan fails to properly pitch his app idea to [[Warren Buffett]]. Roger takes refuge in a [[Hipster (contemporary subculture)|hipster]] coffee shop and becomes obsessed with gaining an interview at [[IBM]]. Unbeknownst to Roger, Will films him on a drunken rant about his job skills and later turns it into a video resume. Roger is nearly arrested for harassing the IBM hiring manager but is saved by Will and his friends, resulting in Roger gaining an interview and obtaining his dream employment.\n\nWith the support of Jillian, Will turns down the promotion and other job offers, instead opting to start his own video production company and he finds success. Luke eventually does well as a stock trader, Charlie realizes that the [[participation trophy]] ethos of his generation did more harm than good and finds new motivation, and Ethan finally achieves success with his app.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Miles Teller]] as Will Davis\n* [[Anna Kendrick]] as Jillian Stewart\n* [[Brandon T.
