It was directed by [[Sam Raimi]] from a [[screenplay]] by Raimi, his older brother [[Ivan Raimi|Ivan]] and [[Alvin Sargent]]. It is the final installment in Raimi's [[Spider-Man (2002 film series)|''Spider-Man'' trilogy]], and the sequel to ''[[Spider-Man (2002 film)|Spider-Man]]'' (2002) and ''[[Spider-Man 2]]'' (2004). The film stars [[Tobey Maguire]] as [[Peter Parker (Sam Raimi film series)|Peter Parker / Spider-Man]], alongside [[Kirsten Dunst]], [[James Franco]], [[Thomas Haden Church]], [[Topher Grace]], [[Bryce Dallas Howard]], [[James Cromwell]], [[Rosemary Harris]], and [[J. K. Simmons]]. The film also marks the final film appearance of [[Cliff Robertson]] before his retirement and death in 2011. Set a year after the events of ''Spider-Man 2'', the film follows Peter Parker as he prepares for his future with [[Mary Jane Watson (Sam Raimi film series)|Mary Jane Watson]], while facing three new villains: [[Uncle Ben]]'s true killer, Flint Marko, who becomes [[Sandman (Marvel Comics)|Sandman]] after a freak accident; [[Harry Osborn]], his best friend, who is now aware of Peter's identity and seeks to avenge his [[Norman Osborn|father]]; and [[Eddie Brock]], a rival photographer who subsequently transforms into [[Venom (Marvel Comics character)|Venom]]. Peter also faces his greatest challenge when he bonds with an extraterrestrial [[Symbiote (comics)|symbiote]] that increases his abilities but amplifies his anger and other negative traits.\n\nDevelopment of ''Spider-Man 3'' began immediately after the successful release of ''Spider-Man 2'' for a 2007 release. During pre-production, Raimi originally wanted two villains, Harry Osborn and Sandman. At the request of producer [[Avi Arad]], he added Venom to the list and the producers also requested the addition of [[Gwen Stacy]]. [[Principal photography]] for the film began in January 2006, and took place in [[Los Angeles]] and [[Cleveland]] before moving to [[New York City]] from May until July 2006. Additional pick-up shots were made after August and the film wrapped in October 2006. During post-production, [[Sony Pictures Imageworks]] created over 900 [[visual effects]] shots. With an estimated production budget of $258\u2013350 million, it was the [[List of most expensive films|most expensive film ever made]] at the time of its release.\n\n''Spider-Man 3'' premiered on April 16, 2007, in Tokyo, and was released in the United States in both conventional and [[IMAX]] theaters on May 4, 2007. The film grossed $894.9 million worldwide, making it the highest-grossing film of the trilogy, the [[2007 in film#Highest-grossing films|third-highest-grossing film of 2007]] and was the [[List of highest-grossing films#Highest-grossing franchises and film series|highest-grossing ''Spider-Man'' film]] until it was surpassed by ''[[Spider-Man: Far From Home]]'' in 2019. Unlike the previous installments, ''Spider-Man 3'' received generally mixed reviews from critics, who praised the action sequences and visual effects, but were polarized over the plot and pacing, while criticized the film's sheer number of villains and deemed it inferior to its two predecessors.\n\nA fourth installment, titled ''Spider-Man 4'', was set to be released on May 6, 2011, followed by a ''Venom'' spin-off film, but both were canceled. The ''Spider-Man'' film series was rebooted twice; first with ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man (film)|The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' (2012) by [[Marc Webb]] and starring [[Andrew Garfield]]; and later a new film series set within the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU) directed by [[Jon Watts]] and starring [[Tom Holland]], beginning with ''[[Spider-Man: Homecoming]]'' (2017). ''[[Spider-Man: No Way Home]]'' (2021) explored the concept of the [[Multiverse (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|multiverse]] to connect the previous films and characters to the MCU with Maguire and Church reprising their roles in the film.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per [[WP:FILMPLOT]], plot summaries for featured films are set between 400-700 words. -->\nA year after [[Otto Octavius (Sam Raimi film series)|Otto Octavius]]' sacrifice,{{efn|As depicted in ''[[Spider-Man 2]]'' (2004).}} [[Peter Parker (Sam Raimi film series)|Peter Parker]] plans to propose to [[Mary Jane Watson (Sam Raimi film series)|Mary Jane Watson]], who has made her [[Broadway theatre|Broadway musical]] debut. In [[Central Park]], a [[meteorite]] lands near the two, and an extraterrestrial [[Symbiote (comics)|symbiote]] follows Peter to his apartment by attaching to his [[motorbike]]. [[Harry Osborn (Sam Raimi film series)|Harry Osborn]], knowing Peter is Spider-Man, seeks to avenge his [[Norman Osborn (Sam Raimi film series)|father]]'s death. Using his father's performance-enhancing gas and [[Green Goblin]] technology, he battles Peter to an eventual stalemate, developing partial [[amnesia]]. Meanwhile, police pursue escaped convict [[Flint Marko]], who visits his wife and sick daughter before fleeing. Falling into an experimental [[particle accelerator]] that fuses his body with the surrounding sand, he gains the ability to control and reform his body with sand, becoming [[Sandman (Marvel Comics)|Sandman]].\n\nDuring a festival honoring Spider-Man for saving [[Gwen Stacy]]'s life, Peter kisses her to please the crowd, angering Mary Jane. Marko then robs an armored truck and escapes after defeating Spider-Man. [[NYPD]] Captain [[George Stacy]], Gwen's father, informs Peter and his [[aunt May]] that Marko is [[uncle Ben]]'s true killer; the deceased [[Burglar (comics)|Dennis Carradine]] was Marko's accomplice. At the apartment, the symbiote assimilates the Spider-Man suit as Peter sleeps in it while waiting for Marko to come out of hiding. Peter awakens on top of a building, discovering that the symbiote has colored his suit black and enhanced his powers; however, it also brings out darker parts of his personality.\n\nPeter locates and battles Marko in a subway tunnel. Discovering that water is his weakness, he opens a pipe, releasing water that reduces Marko to mud and washes him away in a sewer. Peter's changed demeanor alienates Mary Jane, who also receives negative reviews from critics. She shares a tender moment with Harry but leaves in regret. Urged by a hallucination of his father, Harry recovers from his amnesia and forces Mary Jane to break up with Peter. Harry later meets up with Peter and tells him that Mary Jane loves him. Under the symbiote's influence, Peter confronts Harry and spitefully claims that his father never loved him. As Peter leaves after an ensuing fight, Harry throws a pumpkin bomb at him; Peter deflects it back, disfiguring Harry's face.\n\nAt the ''[[Daily Bugle]]'', Peter exposes rival photographer [[Eddie Brock]], whose fake photos incriminate Spider-Man. Publisher [[J. Jonah Jameson (film character)|J. Jonah Jameson]] fires Brock and promotes Peter to staff photographer. Later, Peter brings Gwen to a jazz club where Mary Jane now works. In an attempt to make her jealous, Peter interrupts Mary Jane's performance and dances with Gwen in front of her. Upon realizing Peter's true intentions, Gwen apologizes to Mary Jane and leaves. After assaulting the bouncers and accidentally hitting Mary Jane, Peter realizes that the symbiote is corrupting him. Retreating to a church's bell tower and discovering that the sounds of clanging metal weaken the creature, Peter removes the symbiote. Brock is at the same church and becomes the symbiote's new host.\n\nAs [[Venom (Marvel Comics character)|Venom]], Brock locates a still-living Marko and convinces him to join forces to kill Spider-Man. Brock abducts Mary Jane and holds her captive from a web at a construction site, intending to kill her in revenge for Peter ruining him, while Marko keeps the police at bay. After Harry declines to help Peter, Harry's butler reveals that Norman's death was not Spider-Man's fault. While Brock and Marko pin Peter down, Harry arrives to help Peter and save Mary Jane. Brock attempts to impale Peter with Harry's [[glider (aircraft)|glider]], but Harry jumps in and is impaled instead. While remembering the symbiote's weakness, Peter assembles a perimeter of metal pipes to create a sonic attack, weakening it and allowing Peter to separate Brock from the symbiote.\n\nPeter activates a pumpkin bomb and throws it at the hostless symbiote. Having become addicted to its influence, Brock attempts to save the symbiote, and both are vaporized. Marko explains that Ben's death was an accident that has haunted him and that everything he has done was to help his daughter; Peter forgives Marko, allowing him to escape. Peter and Harry reconcile before the latter dies from his injuries. Sometime after Harry's funeral, Peter visits Mary Jane at the jazz club, where they embrace and share a dance.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Tobey Maguire]] as [[Peter Parker (Sam Raimi film series)|Peter Parker / Spider-Man]]: A superhero, a brilliant [[physics]] student at [[Columbia University]], and photographer for the ''Daily Bugle''.

Sony also reportedly considered inviting Raimi to do another solo trilogy with Tobey Maguire following the critically lukewarm reception and financial underperformance of ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man 2]]'' (2014), but the project was eventually scrapped.<ref name=\"Fritz\">{{cite web |date=December 10, 2014 |last=Fritz |first=Ben |title=Sony, Marvel Discussed Spider-Man Movie Crossover |url=https://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2014/12/09/sony-marvel-discussed-spider-man-movie-crossover/ |website=[[Wall Street Journal]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150218200339/http://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2014/12/09/sony-marvel-discussed-spider-man-movie-crossover/ |archive-date=2015-02-18 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Iacobucci |first=Jordan |title=10 Facts About The Canceled Amazing Spider-Man 3 Film |url=https://screenrant.com/amazing-spider-man-3-canceled-facts/ |website=Screen Rant |date=November 17, 2021 |publisher=Screen Rant |access-date=17 November 2021 |archive-date=November 23, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211123000440/https://screenrant.com/amazing-spider-man-3-canceled-facts/ |quote=there were at one point considerations for the Raimi and Webb versions of the character, played by Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield respectively, to meet on the big screen as far back as 2014. }}</ref>\n\n===Marvel Cinematic Universe===\n{{Main|Spider-Man: Homecoming|Spider-Man: Far From Home|Spider-Man: No Way Home}}\nFollowing the underwhelming critical and commercial reception of ''The Amazing Spider-Man 2'', Sony and [[Marvel Studios]] announced in February 2015 that a new iteration of Spider-Man would appear in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]], with the character appearing in ''[[Captain America: Civil War]]''.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2015/02/10/sinister-six-delayed-at-sony-spider-man-to-appear-in-captain-america-civil-war | title=Sinister Six Delayed at Sony, Spider-Man to Appear in ''Captain America: Civil War'' | publisher=IGN.com | date=February 10, 2015 | access-date=February 10, 2015 | archive-date=February 11, 2015 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150211063501/http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/02/10/sinister-six-delayed-at-sony-spider-man-to-appear-in-captain-america-civil-war | url-status=live }}</ref> As part of the agreement, Sony Pictures continued to finance, distribute, own and have final creative control of the ''Spider-Man'' films.
