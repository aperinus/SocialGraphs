It is also the first time that each character appeared on film in color and widescreen.{{sfn|Godziszewski|1979|p=35}} The film stars [[Tadao Takashima]], [[Kenji Sahara]], [[Y\u016b Fujiki]], [[Ichir\u014d Arishima]], and [[Mie Hama]], with [[Shoichi Hirose]] as King Kong and [[Haruo Nakajima]] as [[Godzilla]].

A heavily re-edited \"Americanized\" version of the film was released theatrically in the United States by [[Universal Pictures|Universal International Inc.]] on June 26, 1963.\n\nThe film was followed by ''[[Mothra vs. Godzilla]]'', released on April 29, 1964.{{sfn|Kalat|2010|p=67}}\n\n==Plot==\nMr. Tako, head of Pacific Pharmaceuticals, is frustrated with the television shows his company is sponsoring and wants something to boost his ratings. When a doctor tells Tako about a giant monster he discovered on the small Faro Island, Tako believes that it would be a brilliant idea to use the monster to gain publicity. Tako immediately sends two men, Osamu Sakurai and Kinsaburo Furue, to find and bring back the monster. Meanwhile, the American [[nuclear submarine]] ''Seahawk'' gets caught in an [[iceberg]]. The iceberg collapses, unleashing [[Godzilla]], who had been trapped within it since 1955.{{efn|As depicted in ''[[Godzilla Raids Again]]'' (1955)}} Godzilla then destroys the submarine and makes its way towards Japan, attacking a military base as he journeys southward.\n \nOn Faro Island, a gigantic octopus crawls ashore and attacks the native village in search of Farolacton juice, taken from a species of red berry native to the island. The mysterious Faro monster, revealed to be [[King Kong]], arrives and defeats the octopus. Kong then drinks several vases full of the juice while the islanders perform a ceremony, which both cause him to fall asleep. Sakurai and Furue place Kong on a large raft and begin to transport him back to Japan. Mr. Tako arrives on the ship transporting Kong, but a [[Japan Self Defense Force|JSDF]] ship stops them and orders them to return Kong to Faro Island. Meanwhile, Godzilla arrives in Japan and begins terrorizing the countryside. Kong wakes up and breaks free from the raft. Reaching the mainland, Kong confronts Godzilla and proceeds to throw giant rocks at Godzilla. Godzilla is not fazed by King Kong's rock attack and uses its atomic heat ray to burn him. Kong retreats after realizing that he is not yet ready to take on Godzilla and its atomic heat ray.\n \nThe JSDF digs a large pit laden with explosives and poison gas and lures Godzilla into it, but Godzilla is unharmed. They next string up a barrier of power lines around the city filled with 1,000,000 volts of electricity, which proves effective against Godzilla. Kong then approaches Tokyo and tears through the power lines, feeding off the electricity, which seems to make him stronger. Kong then enters Tokyo and captures Fumiko, Sakurai's sister, taking her to the [[National Diet Building]] which he then scales. The JSDF launches capsules full of vaporised Farolacton juice, which puts Kong to sleep, and are able to rescue Fumiko. The JSDF then decides to transport Kong via balloons to Godzilla, in hopes that they will kill each other.\n \nThe next morning, Kong is deployed by helicopter next to Godzilla at the summit of [[Mount Fuji]] and the two engage in a final battle. Godzilla initially has the advantage dazing Kong with a devastating dropkick and repeated tail blows to his head. Godzilla then attempts to burn Kong to death by using its atomic breath to set fire to the foliage around Kong's body. Suddenly, a bolt of lightning from thunder clouds strikes Kong, reviving him and charging him up, and the battle resumes. Godzilla and King Kong fight their way down the mountain and into [[Atami, Shizuoka|Atami]], where the two monsters destroy Atami Castle while trading blows, before falling off a cliff together into [[Sagami Bay]]. After a brief underwater battle, only Kong resurfaces from the water, victorious, and he begins to swim back toward his home island. There is no sign of Godzilla, but the JSDF speculates that it is possible it survived.\n\n==Cast==\n===Japanese version===\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Tadao Takashima]] as Osamu Sakurai\n* [[Kenji Sahara]]{{efn|Miscredited as \"Keji Sahaka\" in the American version of the film.{{sfn|Olave|1997|p=197}}}} as Kazuo Fujita\n* [[Y\u016b Fujiki]] as Kinsaburo Furue\n* [[Ichir\u014d Arishima]] as Mr. Tako\n* [[Mie Hama]] as Fumiko Sakurai\n* [[Jun Tazaki]] as General Masami Shinzo\n* [[Akiko Wakabayashi]] as Tamie\n* [[Akihiko Hirata]] as  Defense Minister Shigezawa\n* Somesho Matsumoto{{efn|Sometimes miscredited as \"Somekichi Matsumoto.\"{{sfn|Ryfle|1998|p=353}}}} as Dr. Ohnuki\n* [[Akemi Negishi]] as Chikiro's mother, Faro Island native\n* Senkichi Omura as Konno, TTV Translator \n* [[Sachio Sakai]] as Obayashi, Mr. Tako's assistant \n* Haruya Kato as Obayashi's assistant\n* Yoshio Kosugi as Faro Island chief \n* [[Yoshifumi Tajima]] as ship captain\n* Harold S.

O'Brien|Willis O'Brien]], animator of the [[King Kong|original stop-motion Kong]]. Around 1960,{{sfn|Ryfle|1998|p=80}} O'Brien came up with a proposed treatment, ''King Kong Meets Frankenstein'',{{sfn|Cotta Vaz|2005|p=361}} where Kong would fight against a giant [[Frankenstein's monster|Frankenstein Monster]] in [[San Francisco]].{{sfn|Archer|1993|pp=80\u201383}} O'Brien took the project (which consisted of some concept art{{sfn|Ackerman|1966|pp=58-60}} and a screenplay treatment) to [[RKO]] to secure permission to use the King Kong character. During this time, the story was renamed ''King Kong vs. the Ginko''{{sfn|Glut|1973|pp=242-244}} when it was believed that Universal had the rights to the Frankenstein name. O'Brien was introduced to producer John Beck, who promised to find a studio to make the film (at this point, RKO was no longer a production company). Beck took the story treatment and hired [[George Worthing Yates]] to write the screenplay for the film. The story was slightly altered and the title changed to ''King Kong vs. Prometheus'', returning the name to the original Frankenstein concept (''The Modern Prometheus'' was the alternate title of the [[Frankenstein|original novel]]).{{sfn|Ryfle|1998|p=80}} The November 2, 1960 issue of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' reported that Beck had even asked a filmmaker named Jerry Guran (a possible misspelling of filmmaker [[Nathan Juran]]'s pseudonym Jerry Juran) to direct the film.{{sfn|Ryfle|1998|pp=80-81}} Unfortunately, the cost of [[stop-motion animation]] discouraged potential studios from putting the film into production. After shopping the script around overseas, Beck eventually attracted the interest of the Japanese studio [[Toho]], which had long wanted to make a ''King Kong'' film.<ref name=\"Universal Blu-ray\">{{cite web|title=KING KONG VS GODZILLA and KING KONG ESCAPES on Blu-ray from Universal|url=http://www.scifijapan.com/articles/2014/02/07/king-kong-vs-godzilla-and-king-kong-escapes-on-blu-ray-from-universal/|archive-date=February 8, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140208074816/http://www.scifijapan.com/articles/2014/02/07/king-kong-vs-godzilla-and-king-kong-escapes-on-blu-ray-from-universal/|url-status=dead|access-date=April 3, 2022|website=SciFi Japan}}</ref>{{efn|According to special effects director [[Teruyoshi Nakano]], [[Tomoyuki Tanaka]] and [[Eiji Tsuburaya]] wanted to make a [[King Kong (franchise)|''King Kong'' film]] for Toho as early as 1954 because he was \"world-famous\".{{sfn|Homenick|Rainey|2005|pp=53-54}}}} After purchasing the script, they decided to replace the giant Frankenstein Monster with [[Godzilla]] to be King Kong's opponent and would have [[Shinichi Sekizawa]] rewrite Yates' script.{{efn|The concept of a giant Frankenstein Monster would be used later by Toho in ''[[Frankenstein Conquers the World]]'' (1965) and its sequel ''[[The War of the Gargantuas]]'' (1966).

Cooper]], the producer of the 1933 ''King Kong'' film, was bitterly opposed to the project, stating in a letter addressed to his friend Douglas Burden, \"I was indignant when some Japanese company made a belittling thing, to a creative mind, called ''King Kong vs. Godzilla''. I believe they even stooped so low as to use a man in a gorilla suit, which I have spoken out against so often in the early days of ''[[King Kong (1933 film)|King Kong]]''\".<ref>L. Tom Perry Special Collections. [[Brigham Young University]]. Cooper Papers. Box MSS 2008 Box 8 Folder 6</ref> In 1963, he filed a lawsuit to enjoin distribution of the movie against John Beck, as well as Toho and Universal (the film's U.S. copyright holder) claiming that he outright owned the King Kong character, but the lawsuit never went through, as it turned out he was not Kong's sole legal owner as he had previously believed.{{sfn|Cotta Vaz|2005|pp=361\u2013363}}\n\n===Themes===\nDirector Ishir\u014d Honda wanted the theme of the movie to be a satire of the television industry in Japan. In April 1962, TV networks and their various sponsors started producing outrageous programming and publicity stunts to grab audiences' attention after two elderly viewers reportedly died at home while watching a violent wrestling match on TV.{{sfn|Ryfle|Godziszewski|2017|p=185}} The various rating wars between the networks and banal programming that followed this event caused widespread debate over how TV would affect Japanese culture with [[S\u014dichi \u014cya]] stating TV was creating \"a nation of 100 million idiots\".{{sfn|Chun|2006|p=3}} Honda stated \"People were making a big deal out of ratings, but my own view of TV shows was that they did not take the viewer seriously, that they took the audience for granted...so I decided to show that through my movie\"{{sfn|Ryfle|Godziszewski|2017|p=185}} and \"the reason I showed the monster battle through the prism of a ratings war was to depict the reality of the times\".{{sfn|Ryfle|Godziszewski|2017|p=187}} Honda addressed this by having a pharmaceutical company sponsor a TV show and going to extremes for a publicity stunt for ratings by capturing a giant monster stating \"All a medicine company would have to do is just produce good medicines you know? But the company doesn't think that way. They think they will get ahead of their competitors if they use a monster to promote their product.\".{{sfn|Ryfle|1998|p=82}} Honda would work with screenwriter Shinichi Sekizawa on developing the story stating that \"Back then Sekizawa was working on pop songs and TV shows so he really had a clear insight into television\".{{sfn|Ryfle|Godziszewski|2017|p=187}}\n\n===Filming===\nSpecial effects director Eiji Tsuburaya was planning on working on other projects at this point in time such as a new version of a fairy tale film script called ''[[The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter|Princess Kaguya]]'', but he postponed those to work on this project with Toho instead since he was such a huge fan of King Kong.{{sfn|Ichikawa|1996|pp=48-53}} He stated in an early 1960s interview with the [[Mainichi Shimbun|Mainichi Newspaper]], \"But my movie company has produced a very interesting script that combined King Kong and Godzilla, so I couldn't help working on this instead of my other fantasy films. The script is special to me; it makes me emotional because it was ''King Kong'' that got me interested in the world of special photographic techniques when I saw it in 1933.\"{{sfn|Takeuchi|1991|pp=56-57}}\n\nEarly drafts of the script were sent back with notes from the studio asking that the monster antics be made as \"funny as possible\".{{sfn|Ryfle|Godziszewski|2017|p=188}} This comical approach was embraced by Tsuburaya, who wanted to appeal to children's sensibilities and broaden the genre's audience.{{sfn|Kabuki|1993|pp=115\u2013123}} Much of the monster battle was filmed to contain a great deal of humor but the approach was not favoured by most of the effects crew, who \"couldn't believe\" some of the things Tsuburaya asked them to do, such as Kong and Godzilla volleying a giant boulder back and forth. With the exception of the next film, ''[[Mothra vs. Godzilla]]'', this film began the trend to portray Godzilla and the monsters with more and more anthropomorphism as the series progressed, to appeal more to younger children. Ishir\u014d Honda was not a fan of the dumbing down of the monsters.{{sfn|Ryfle|1998|p=82}} Years later, Honda stated in an interview. \"I don't think a monster should ever be a comical character,\" and \"The public is more entertained when the great King Kong strikes fear into the hearts of the little characters.\"{{sfn|Honda|Yamamoto|Masuda|2010|pp=62-63}} The decision was also taken to shoot the film in a (2.35:1) scope ratio ([[TohoScope]]) and to film in color (Eastman Color), marking both monsters' first widescreen and color portrayals.{{sfn|Gakken Graphic Books|1996|pp=24-25}}\n\nToho had planned to shoot the film on location in [[Sri Lanka]], but abandoned the idea after being forced to pay RKO roughly {{\u00a5|80 million}} ($220,000) for the rights to the King Kong character, which forced the company to scale down their original production costs.{{sfn|Galbraith IV|1998|p=86}}{{sfn|Ryfle|Godziszewski|2017|p=186}} The bulk of the film was shot on the Japanese island of [[Izu \u014cshima]] instead.{{sfn|Galbraith IV|1998|p=86}} The movie's production budget came out to {{\u00a5|150 million}}{{sfn|Takeuchi|2000|p=27}} ({{US$|{{#expr:150000000/360 round -4}}|long=no}}).<ref name=\"currency\">{{cite web |title=Official exchange rate (LCU per US$, period average) - Japan |url=https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/PA.NUS.FCRF?end=1971&locations=JP&start=1960 |website=[[World Bank]] |access-date=May 29, 2020}}</ref>\n\nSuit actors [[Shoichi Hirose]] (as King Kong) and [[Haruo Nakajima]] (as Godzilla) were given mostly free rein by Tsuburaya to choreograph their own moves. The men would rehearse for hours and would base their moves on those of professional wrestling (a sport that was growing in popularity in Japan),{{sfn|Ragone|2014|p=70}} in particular the moves of [[Toyonobori]].{{sfn|Cirronella|2013|p=68}}\n\nDuring pre-production, Tsuburaya had toyed with the idea of using Willis O'Brien's [[stop-motion]] technique instead of the [[suitmation]] process used in the first two ''Godzilla'' films, but budgetary concerns prevented him from using the process, and the more cost-efficient suitmation was used instead. However, some brief stop-motion was used in a couple of quick sequences. Two of these sequences were animated by Minoru Nakano.{{sfn|Galbraith IV|1998|p=87}}\n\n[[File:kkvsgfilming.jpg|thumb|right|Eiji Tsuburaya directs Shoichi Hirose (in the King Kong suit) and Haruo Nakajima (in the Godzilla suit) on the Mount Fuji set during filming.]]\n\nA brand new Godzilla suit was designed for this film and some slight alterations were done to its overall appearance. These alterations included the removal of its tiny ears, three toes on each foot rather than four, enlarged central dorsal fins, and a bulkier body. These new features gave Godzilla a more reptilian/dinosaurian appearance.{{sfn|Yamada|Motoyama|Tsuchiya|1994|p=72}} Outside of the suit, a meter-high model and a small puppet were also built. Another puppet (from the waist up) was also designed that had a nozzle in the mouth to spray out liquid mist simulating Godzilla's atomic breath. However the shots in the film where this prop was employed (far away shots of Godzilla breathing its atomic breath during its attack on the Arctic Military base) were ultimately cut from the film.{{sfn|Kaneko|Nakajima|1983|p=103}} These cut scenes can be seen in the Japanese theatrical trailer.{{sfn|Ryfle|1998|p=84}} Finally, a separate prop of Godzilla's tail was also built for close-up practical shots when its tail would be used (such as the scene where Godzilla trips Kong with its tail). The tail prop would be swung offscreen by a [[stagehand]].{{sfn|Kaneko|Nakajima|1983|p=103}}\n\nSadamasa Arikawa (who worked with Tsuburaya) said that the sculptors had a hard time coming up with a King Kong suit that appeased Tsuburaya.{{sfn|Kabuki|1993|pp=115\u2013123}} The first suit was rejected for being too fat with long legs giving Kong what the crew considered an almost cute look.{{sfn|Kabuki|1993|pp=115\u2013123}} A few other designs were done before Tsuburaya would approve the final look that was ultimately used in the film. The suit's body design was a team effort by brothers Koei Yagi and Kanji Yagi and was covered with expensive yak hair, which Eiz\u014d Kaimai hand-dyed brown.{{sfn|Motoyama|Matsunomoto|Asai|Suzuki|2012|pp=66-69}} Because RKO instructed that the face must be different from the original's design, sculptor Teiz\u014d Toshimitsu based Kong's face on the [[Japanese macaque]] rather than a gorilla, and designed two separate masks.{{sfn|Motoyama|Matsunomoto|Asai|Suzuki|2012|pp=66-69}} As well, two separate pairs of arms were also created. One pair were extended arms operated by poles inside the suit to give Kong a gorilla-like illusion, while the other pair were at normal arms-length and featured gloves that were used for scenes that required Kong to grab items and wrestle with Godzilla.{{sfn|Yamada|1995|p=48}} Suit actor Hirose had to be sewn into the suit in order to hide the zipper. This would force him to be trapped inside the suit for large amounts of time and would cause him much physical discomfort. In the scene where Kong drinks the berry juice and falls asleep, he was trapped in the suit for three hours. Besides the suit with the two separate arm attachments, a meter-high model and a puppet of Kong (used for closeups) were also built.{{sfn|Kaneko|Nakajima|1983|p=67}}{{sfn|Kishikawa|1994|p=62}} As well, a huge prop of Kong's hand was built for the scene where he grabs [[Mie Hama]] (Fumiko) and carries her off.{{sfn|Kishikawa|1994|p=63}}{{sfn|Gakken Graphic Books|1996|p=25}}{{sfn|Mamiya|2000|p=90}}\n\nFor the attack of the giant octopus, four live octopuses were used.{{sfn|Morton|2005|p=126}} They were forced to move among the miniature huts by having hot air blown onto them.

He was able to line up a couple of potential distributors in [[Warner Bros.]] and [[Universal Studios|Universal-International]] even before the film began production. Beck, accompanied by two Warner Bros. representatives, attended at least two private screenings of the film on the Toho Studios lot before it was released in Japan.{{sfn|Ryfle|1998|p=87}}\n\nJohn Beck enlisted the help of two Hollywood writers, Paul Mason and Bruce Howard, to write a new screenplay.<ref name=\"Mason\"/>{{sfn|Ryfle|1998|p=88}} After discussions with Beck, the two wrote the American version and worked with editor [[Peter Zinner]] to remove scenes, recut others, and change the sequence of several events.{{sfn|Ryfle|1998|p=89}} To give the film more of an American feel, Mason and Howard decided to insert new footage that would convey the impression that the film was actually a newscast. The television actor Michael Keith played newscaster Eric Carter, a [[United Nations]] reporter who spends much of the time commenting on the action from the [[Headquarters of the United Nations|U.N. Headquarters]] via an [[Communications satellite|International Communications Satellite]] (ICS) broadcast. [[Harry Holcombe]] was cast as Dr. Arnold Johnson, the head of the Museum of Natural History in New York City, who tries to explain Godzilla's origin and his and Kong's motivations.{{sfn|Ragone|Tucker|1991|p=27}}\n\nBeck and his crew were able to obtain [[library music]] from a host of older films, including ''[[Creature from the Black Lagoon]]'' (1954).{{sfn|Ryfle|1998|p=90}}{{sfn|Galbraith IV|2008|p=194}} Cues from these scores were used to almost completely replace the original Japanese score by [[Akira Ifukube]] and give the film a more Western sound.{{sfn|Hirsch|2006|pp=4-9}} They also obtained stock footage from the film ''[[The Mysterians]]'' from RKO (the film's U.S. copyright holder at the time) which was used not only to represent the ICS, but which was also utilized during the film's climax.{{sfn|Ryfle|1998|p=90}} Stock footage of a massive earthquake from ''The Mysterians'' was employed to make the earthquake caused by Kong and Godzilla's plummet into the ocean much more violent than the tame tremor seen in the Japanese version. This added footage features massive tidal waves, flooded valleys, and the ground splitting open swallowing up various huts.{{sfn|Ryfle|1998|p=90}}\n\nBeck spent roughly $12,000 making his English version and sold the film to Universal-International for roughly $200,000 on April 29, 1963.{{sfn|Ryfle|1998|p=89}} The film was released theatrically in the United States on June 26 of that year,<ref name=\"Universal Blu-ray\"/> as a [[double feature]] with ''[[The Traitors (1962 film)|The Traitors]]''.{{sfn|Lees|Cerasini|1998|p=21}}\n\nStarting in 1963, Toho's international sales booklets began advertising an English dub of ''King Kong vs. Godzilla'' alongside Toho-commissioned, unedited international dubs of movies such as ''[[Varan the Unbelievable|Giant Monster Varan]]'' and ''[[The Last War (1961 film)|The Last War]]''.
