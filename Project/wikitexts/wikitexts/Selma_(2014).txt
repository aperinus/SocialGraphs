The film was re-released on March 20, 2015 in honor of the 50th anniversary of the historical march.\n\nThe film was nominated for [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]] and won [[Academy Award for Best Original Song|Best Original Song]] at the [[87th Academy Awards]].

Four black girls walking down stairs in the [[Birmingham, Alabama]] [[16th Street Baptist Church]] are killed by a [[16th Street Baptist Church bombing|bomb]] set by the [[Ku Klux Klan]].  [[Annie Lee Cooper]] attempts to register to vote in [[Selma, Alabama]], but is prevented by the white registrar. King meets with [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] and asks for federal legislation to allow black citizens to register to vote unencumbered, but the president responds that, although he understands Dr. King's concerns, he has more important projects. King travels to Selma with [[Ralph Abernathy]], [[Andrew Young]], [[James Orange]], and [[Diane Nash]]. [[James Bevel]] greets them, and other SCLC activists appear. FBI director [[J. Edgar Hoover]] tells Johnson that King is a problem, and suggests they disrupt his marriage. [[Coretta Scott King]] has concerns about her husband's upcoming work in Selma. King calls singer [[Mahalia Jackson]] to inspire him with a song.\n\nKing, other SCLC leaders, and black Selma residents march to the registration office to register. After a confrontation in front of the courthouse, a shoving match occurs as the police go into the crowd. Cooper fights back, knocking Sheriff [[Jim Clark (sheriff)|Jim Clark]] to the ground, leading to the arrest of Cooper, King, and others.\n\nAlabama Governor [[George Wallace]] speaks out against the movement. Coretta meets with [[Malcolm X]], who says he will drive whites to ally with King by advocating a more extreme position. Wallace and [[Albert J. Lingo|Al Lingo]] decide to use force at an upcoming night march in Marion, Alabama, using [[State police|state troopers]] to assault the marchers. A group of protesters runs into a restaurant to hide, but troopers rush in and beat and shoot [[Jimmie Lee Jackson]]. King and Bevel meet with Cager Lee, Jackson's grandfather, at the morgue. King speaks to ask people to continue to fight for their rights. Harassing phone calls with a recording of [[sexual activity]] implied to be King and another woman lead to an argument with Coretta; she knows it is a fabrication, but the strain of constant death threats has taken its toll on her. King is criticized by members of the [[Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee]] (SNCC).\n\nAs the [[Selma to Montgomery marches#First Selma-to-Montgomery March|Selma-to-Montgomery march]] is about to begin, King talks to Young about delaying it for a day so he can spend some time with his family, but Young convinces King to let the march begin as scheduled without him, saying he can join later. The marchers, including [[John Lewis]] of SNCC, [[Hosea Williams]] of SCLC, and Selma activist [[Amelia Boynton]], cross the [[Edmund Pettus Bridge]] and approach a line of state troopers who put on gas masks. The troopers order the marchers to turn back and, when the marchers hold their ground, the troopers attack with clubs, horses, [[tear gas]], and other weapons. Lewis and Boynton are among those badly injured. The attack is shown on national television and the wounded are treated at [[Brown Chapel A.M.E. Church (Selma, Alabama)|Brown Chapel]], the movement's headquarter church.\n\nMovement attorney [[Fred Gray (attorney)|Fred Gray]] asks federal Judge [[Frank Minis Johnson]] to let another attempt at the march go forward. President Johnson demands that King and Wallace cease their activities and sends Assistant Attorney General [[John Doar]] to convince King to postpone the next march. Numerous white Americans, including [[Viola Liuzzo]] and [[James Reeb]], arrive to join the second march. Marchers cross the bridge again and see the state troopers lined up, but the troopers turn aside to let them pass. King, after praying, turns around and leads the group away, which again draws sharp criticism from SNCC activists. That evening, Reeb is beaten to death by an angry white mob on a street in Selma.\n\nAfter a hearing, Judge Johnson approves the march. President Johnson speaks before a [[Joint session of the United States Congress#Historic joint sessions|Joint Session of Congress]] to ask for quick passage of a [[Voting Rights Act of 1965|bill to eliminate restrictions on voting]], praising the courage of the activists. The march on the highway to Montgomery takes place, and, when the marchers reach Montgomery, King [[How Long, Not Long|delivers a speech]] on the steps of the [[Alabama State Capitol|State Capitol]].\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[David Oyelowo]] as [[Martin Luther King Jr.]]<ref name=\"Oyelowo\" />\n* [[Carmen Ejogo]] as [[Coretta Scott King]]<ref name=\"Ejogo\" />\n* [[Oprah Winfrey]] as [[Annie Lee Cooper]]<ref name=\"Winfrey\" />\n* [[Tom Wilkinson]] as [[Lyndon B.

DuVernay drafted alternative speeches that evoke the historic ones without violating the copyright. She recalled spending hours listening to King's words while hiking the canyons of Los Angeles.
