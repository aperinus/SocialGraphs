The film stars [[Gene Hackman]] as a hard-nosed cop who is teamed up with a detective with multiple-personality disorder, played by [[Dan Aykroyd]], to uncover a long-lost [[Nazi]] [[sex tape]], featuring [[Adolf Hitler]], which would jeopardize the political future of the [[Chancellor of Germany|German chancellor-elect]]. The theme song features vocals by [[Katey Sagal]] and Aykroyd.\n\nUpon release by [[Tri-Star Pictures]] on February 9, 1990, the film was a critical and financial [[Box office flop|disaster]], bringing in only $5.5 million worldwide on a $15 million budget.\n\n==Plot==\nA film is found that features young German officer Kirk von Metz sleeping with [[Adolf Hitler]]. Years later, von Metz, running for chancellor of [[West Germany]], arranges for anyone who has seen the film to be murdered. The killings take place in the [[Washington D.C.]] area, and [[Metropolitan Police Department of the District of Columbia|Metropolitan Police]] officers MacArthur \"Mac\" Stern and Ellis Fielding are sent to investigate the crimes.\n\nEllis suffers from a [[multiple personality disorder|dissociative identity disorder]] stemming from a disastrous undercover drug sting, which is aggravated when he is confronted with violence. This results in several episodes where he blacks out and assumes the personalities of popular culture characters, including [[Popeye]], [[James T. Kirk|Captain Kirk]] and [[the Road Runner]].\n\nMac and Ellis attempt to track down the film through pornographer Harry \"The Hippo\" Gutterman, who informs them that to do so they need to get to [[New York City]]. They decide to take a train, but first must evade a team of [[FBI]] agents led by Bob Smiley, who must shield von Metz from embarrassment by intercepting the film before it goes public. They all meet up at Washington's [[Union Station (Washington, D.C.)|Union Station]], where Mac and Ellis trick Smiley and his team into boarding the New York-bound train they originally intended to take, while they jump off and hop onto one on the opposite track bound for [[Cleveland]] instead. While on board that train, Mac notices another undercover team that has been trailing them, which is revealed to be led by Rebecca \"Riva\" Lowengrin, a [[Mossad]] agent assigned to the [[Embassy of Israel in Washington, D.C.]]\n\nAfter surviving a helicopter attack on the train by Nazi sympathizers, Mac, Ellis and Gutterman jump off a bridge into a river and eventually make their way to New York. En route, Ellis confides in Mac his fear that if another episode occurs it could prove irrevocable, which would make him a dangerous liability, and wishes to return to the Benedictine Monks who originally looked after him during his recovery. Mac, however, reiterates his belief in Ellis and shows him that he is strong enough to persevere, move forward and recover; that the past is irrelevant and that the present and the future are what matter. Consequently, Ellis regains his courage and the will to fight. Mac finds the film in a locker on one of the upper levels of [[Grand Central Terminal]] and, during an exchange of gunfire with more Nazis, throws the film to Riva, who has just arrived on the main concourse below. It is screened that same evening during a speech that von Metz delivers. Mac, Ellis and Gutterman all suffer gunshot wounds and, as the movie ends, are seen recuperating in the same hospital. Mac jokes to Ellis that he is converting to [[Judaism]] that evening in order to move to [[Israel]] to join the Mossad but is uncomfortable about undergoing [[circumcision]]. Ellis catches on to the humor and points out that the reason that they work together so well as partners is because technically, Mac is crazier than he is.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Gene Hackman]] as Detective MacArthur 'Mac' Stern\n* [[Dan Aykroyd]] as Detective Ellis Fielding\n* [[Dom DeLuise]] as Harry 'The Hippo' Gutterman\n* [[Ronny Cox]] as Bob Smiley\n* [[Nancy Travis]] as Agent Rebecca 'Riva' Lowengrin\n* [[Paul Koslo]] as Grimmer\n* [[Dick O'Neill]] as Captain \n* [[Robert Prosky]] as Kirk Von Metz\n* [[Jan Triska]] as Steckler\n* [[Leon Rippy]] as Weskit\n* Robert Elliott as Monseigner\n* [[David Alan Grier]] as Drummond\n* [[S.
