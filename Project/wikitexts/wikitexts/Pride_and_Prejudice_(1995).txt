[[Jennifer Ehle]] and [[Colin Firth]] starred as [[Elizabeth Bennet]] and [[Mr Darcy]], respectively. Produced by [[Sue Birtwistle]] and directed by [[Simon Langton (television director)|Simon Langton]], the serial was a [[BBC]] production with additional funding from the American [[A&E Network]]. [[BBC One|BBC1]] originally broadcast the 55-minute episodes from 24 September to 29 October 1995. The A&E Network aired the series in double episodes on three consecutive nights beginning 14 January 1996.\n\nCritically acclaimed and a popular success, ''Pride and Prejudice'' was honoured with several awards, including a [[BAFTA Television Award]] for Jennifer Ehle for \"Best Actress\"<ref>{{Cite web|title=BAFTA Awards|url=http://awards.bafta.org/award/1996/television/actress|access-date=2022-01-17|website=awards.bafta.org}}</ref> and an [[Emmy]] for \"Outstanding Individual Achievement in Costume Design for a Miniseries or a Special\". The role of Mr Darcy elevated Colin Firth to stardom. A scene showing Firth in a wet shirt was recognised as \"one of the most unforgettable moments in British TV history\".<ref name=\"hunk\" /> ''[[The New York Times]]'' called the adaptation \"a witty mix of love stories and social conniving, cleverly wrapped in the ambitions and illusions of a provincial gentry\".<ref name=\"heart_and_purse\" /> The series inspired author [[Helen Fielding]] to write the popular ''[[Bridget Jones]]'' novels, and their screen adaptations subsequently featured Firth as Bridget's love interest, Mark Darcy.\n\n== Plot ==\n\n=== Episode one ===\nMr. Charles Bingley, a wealthy gentleman from the north of England, settles down at Netherfield estate near Meryton village in [[Hertfordshire]] for the autumn. Mrs. Bennet, unlike her husband, is excited at the prospect of marrying off one of her five daughters (Jane, Elizabeth, Mary, Kitty, and Lydia) to the newcomer. Mr. Bennet claims to have no intention of calling on Mr. Bingley; unless he does so, his wife and daughters are unable to socialise with Mr. Bingley. Mrs. Bennett, perturbed at Mr. Bennett's refusal to make Bingley's acquaintance, declares that she wishes the girls would stop talking about Mr. Bingley all together, as they will never meet him anyway. Mr. Bennet replies that he wishes he would have known that earlier, as he has already paid Mr. Bingley a visit. Mrs. Bennett and all the girls are shocked and ecstatic. Bingley takes an immediate liking to Jane at a local country dance, while his best friend Mr. Fitzwilliam Darcy, rumoured to be twice as rich, refuses to dance with anyone, including Elizabeth. Elizabeth's poor impression of his character is confirmed at a later gathering at Lucas Lodge, and she and Darcy verbally clash on the two nights she spends at Netherfield, caring for the sick Jane who fell ill after riding in the rain.\n\n=== Episode two ===\nMr William Collins, a sycophantic dimwitted clergyman, visits his cousins, the Bennets. As Mr and Mrs Bennett do not have a son, he is the [[Fee tail|entailed]] heir of their home and estate, Longbourn. He intends to marry a Bennet daughter as an act of benign goodwill, to reassure Mrs Bennet that she and her unwed daughters would not be rendered homeless once Mr Collins inherits the estate. He therefore invites himself for a two-week visit to get to know the Bennets better and select a daughter to marry. However, the Bennet girls judge Mr Collins to be a rather ridiculous man, an \"oddity\" with many peculiarities of speech and deportment. They nevertheless treat him civilly and take him to balls and social events in Meryton. One day, while on a walk around Meryton village, they meet members of a newly arrived militia regiment, including Mr George Wickham. At a social event, Wickham befriends Elizabeth and says that his father was the steward for Darcy's late father, and that he originally planned to join the clergy. However, Darcy denied Wickham the \"living\" (a [[curacy]]) that Mr Darcy's father promised him. At a ball at Netherfield, Darcy asks Elizabeth to dance, which she grudgingly but politely accepts. Mrs Bennet tells Mr Collins that she expects Jane to soon be engaged, so he instead proposes to Elizabeth. She resoundingly rejects him. While Mrs Bennet reacts angrily to Elizabeth's decision, her close friend, Charlotte Lucas, invites Mr Collins to visit at Lucas Lodge.\n\n=== Episode three ===\nElizabeth is stunned and appalled to learn that Charlotte Lucas has accepted Mr Collins' marriage proposal. When the Netherfield party departs for [[London]] in autumn, Jane stays with her modest London relatives, the Gardiners, but she soon notices that the Bingleys ignore her. After befriending Mr Wickham, Elizabeth departs for the Collins' home in [[Kent]] in the spring to visit Charlotte. They live near Rosings, the estate of the formidable Lady Catherine de Bourgh, Darcy's aunt. Elizabeth meets Darcy several times. Elizabeth learns of Darcy's direct responsibility for Jane and Bingley's separation. Soon after, Darcy unexpectedly tells her that he admires her and loves her, so much that in spite of her greatly inferior social standing, he proposes marriage. Elizabeth flatly rejects him, noting his arrogant, disagreeable, and proud character, and for his part in her sister's failed romance and Mr Wickham's misfortune.\n\n=== Episode four ===\nDarcy justifies his previous actions in a long letter to Elizabeth: he misjudged Jane's affection for Bingley, and he exposes Wickham as a gambler who once attempted to elope with his young sister, Georgiana, to obtain her inheritance. Back at Longbourn, Mr Bennet allows Lydia to accompany the militia to [[Brighton]] as a personal friend of the militia colonel's wife. Elizabeth joins the Gardiners on a sightseeing trip to [[Derbyshire]] and visits [[Pemberley]], Darcy's estate, during his absence. Greatly impressed by the immense scale and richness of the estate, Elizabeth listens to the housekeeper's earnest tales of her master's lifelong goodness, while Darcy refreshes from his unannounced journey home by taking a swim in a pond. After an unexpected and awkward encounter with Elizabeth, a damp Darcy is able to prevent the party's premature departure with an unusual degree of friendliness and politeness.\n\n=== Episode five ===\nElizabeth and the Gardiners receive an invitation to Pemberley, where Darcy and Elizabeth share significant glances. The next morning, Elizabeth receives two letters from Jane, revealing that Lydia has eloped with Wickham. As Elizabeth is about to return to Longbourn, Darcy arrives and offers help, but upon hearing the bad news about Lydia, becomes disturbed and leaves in haste. Elizabeth supposes she will never see him again. The Bennets are all dismayed by the scandal, until Mr Gardiner writes that Lydia and Wickham have been found. They are not married, but soon will be under the Gardiners' care. The Bennets are relieved, but Mr Bennet wonders what it cost Mr Gardiner to get Wickham to marry a girl with no fortune. Elizabeth tells Jane of her last meeting with Darcy, including her ambivalent feelings for him.\n\n=== Episode six ===\nAfter Lydia carelessly mentions Darcy's involvement in her wedding, Mrs Gardiner enlightens Elizabeth: Darcy found the errant couple and paid for everything, including a large payoff to Wickham. When Bingley and Darcy return to Netherfield in the autumn, Darcy apologises to Bingley for interfering in his relationship with Jane and gives his blessing for the couple to wed. Lady Catherine de Bourgh, who intends for Darcy to marry her sickly daughter, Anne, has heard rumours of an engagement between Darcy and Elizabeth. She calls on Elizabeth, demanding that she deny the engagement and renounce Darcy forever. Elizabeth confirms that there is no engagement, but refuses any pledge for the future. When Elizabeth thanks Darcy for his role in Lydia's marriage, he says that Lady Catherine's story had encouraged him to reconfirm his feelings for Elizabeth. Elizabeth admits the complete transformation of her feelings and agrees to an engagement, taking her family by surprise. The series ends with a double winter wedding: Jane to Bingley, and Elizabeth to Darcy.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{See also|Pride and Prejudice#Main characters}}\n{{colbegin|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Jennifer Ehle]] as [[Elizabeth Bennet]]\n* [[Colin Firth]] as [[Fitzwilliam Darcy|Mr Fitzwilliam Darcy]]\n* [[Adrian Lukis]] as [[George Wickham|Mr George Wickham]]\n* [[Alison Steadman]] as [[Bennet family#Mrs. Bennet|Mrs Bennet]]\n* [[Benjamin Whitrow]] as [[Bennet family#Mr. Bennet|Mr Bennet]]\n* [[David Bamber]] as [[Mr William Collins]]\n* [[Susannah Harker]] as [[Bennet family#Jane Bennet|Jane Bennet]]\n* [[Julia Sawalha]] as [[Bennet family#Lydia Bennet|Lydia Bennet]]\n* [[Polly Maberly]] as [[Bennet family#Catherine \"Kitty\" Bennet|Catherine (Kitty) Bennet]]\n* [[Lucy Briers]] as [[Bennet family#Mary Bennet|Mary Bennet]]\n* [[Crispin Bonham-Carter]] as Mr Charles Bingley\n* [[Lucy Scott]] as Charlotte Lucas\n* [[Anna Chancellor]] as Caroline Bingley\n* [[Lucy Robinson (actress)|Lucy Robinson]] as Mrs Hurst\n* [[Barbara Leigh-Hunt]] as [[Lady Catherine de Bourgh]]\n* [[Anthony Calf]] as Colonel Fitzwilliam\n* [[Joanna David]] as Mrs Gardiner\n* [[Tim Wylton]] as Mr Gardiner\n* [[Emilia Fox]] as Georgiana Darcy\n* [[Bridget Turner]] as Mrs Reynolds\n* [[David Bark-Jones]] as Lt Denny\n* [[Lynn Farleigh]] as Mrs Phillips\n* [[Lucy Davis]] as Maria Lucas\n* [[Christopher Benjamin (actor)|Christopher Benjamin]] as Sir William Lucas\n* [[Rupert Vansittart]] as Mr Hurst\n* [[Marlene Sidaway]] as Hill\n* [[Roger Barclay]] as Capt Carter\n* [[Kate O'Malley (actress)|Kate O'Malley]] as Sarah, the maid\n* [[Norma Streader]] as Lady Lucas\n* [[Paul Moriarty (actor)|Paul Moriarty]] as Col Forster\n* [[Victoria Hamilton]] as Mrs Forster\n* [[Nadia Chambers]] as Anne de Bourgh\n* [[Sarah Legg]] as Hannah\n* [[Christopher Staines]] as Lt Sanderson\n* [[Tom Ward]] as Lt Chamberlayne\n* [[Alexandra Howerd]] as Mary King\n* [[Peter Needham (actor)|Peter Needham]] as Fencing Master\n* [[Sam Beazley]] as Vicar at Longbourne\n{{colend}}\n\n== Casting ==\nWhen [[Casting (performing arts)|casting]] the many characters of ''Pride and Prejudice'', the producer [[Sue Birtwistle]] and director [[Simon Langton (television director)|Simon Langton]] were looking for actors with wit, charm and charisma, who could play the [[British Regency|Regency]] period. Their choices for the protagonists, 20-year-old [[Elizabeth Bennet]] and 28-year-old [[Mr Darcy]], determined the other actors cast. Hundreds of actresses between 15 and 28 auditioned for the younger female characters, and those with the right presence were [[screen test|screen-tested]], performing several prepared scenes in period costumes and makeup in a television studio. Straight offers were made to several established actors.<ref name=bc_15-21 />\n\n[[Jennifer Ehle]] was chosen from six serious candidates to play Elizabeth, the second Bennet daughter, the brightest girl, and her father's favourite. At the time in her mid-20s, Ehle had read ''Pride and Prejudice'' at the age of 12 and was the only actor to be present throughout the whole filming schedule.<ref name=bc_15-21 /><ref name=bc_27-34 /><ref name=bc_79-87 /> Sue Birtwistle particularly wanted [[Colin Firth]], a relatively unknown British actor in his mid-30s at the time, to play the wealthy and aloof Mr Darcy.<ref name=dvd_making>''Pride and Prejudice \u2013 The Making of...''.

[[BAFTA]]-nominated [[Alison Steadman]] was cast to play the [[parvenu]] Mrs Bennet, Elizabeth's mortifyingly affected social-climbing mother. Steadman was offered the role without auditions or screen tests. Elizabeth's four sisters, whose ages ranged between 15 and 22, were cast to look dissimilar from each other. [[Susannah Harker]] portrayed Elizabeth's beautiful older sister Jane, who desires to only see good in others. [[Lucy Briers]], [[Polly Maberly]], and [[Julia Sawalha]] played Elizabeth's younger sisters \u2013 the plain Mary, the good-natured but flighty and susceptible Kitty, and frivolous and headstrong Lydia. Being 10 years older than 15-year-old Lydia, Julia Sawalha, of ''[[Absolutely Fabulous]]'' fame, had enough acting experience to get the role without screen tests. [[Joanna David]] and [[Tim Wylton]] appeared as the Gardiners, Elizabeth's maternal aunt and uncle. [[David Bamber]] played the unctuous clergyman, Mr Collins, a cousin of Mr Bennet. [[Lucy Scott]] portrayed Elizabeth's best friend and Mr Collins's wife, Charlotte Lucas, and [[David Bark-Jones]] portrayed Lt Denny.<ref name=bc_15-21>Birtwistle and Conklin 1995, pp. 15\u201321.</ref>\n\nThe producers found [[Crispin Bonham-Carter]] to have the best physical contrast to Firth's Darcy and gave him his first major television role as the good-natured and wealthy Mr Charles Bingley.<ref name=bc_15-21 /> Bonham-Carter had originally auditioned for the part of Mr [[George Wickham]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.aetv.com/scenes/pride/pride3c.html |title=Behind the scenes: Crispin Bonham-Carter |publisher=aetv.com ([[A&E Network]]) |access-date=2004-04-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040407172926/http://www.aetv.com/scenes/pride/pride3c.html |archive-date=2004-04-07}}</ref> a handsome militia lieutenant whose charm conceals his licentiousness and greed, but [[Adrian Lukis]] was cast instead.

Casting the role of Darcy's young sister, Georgiana, proved hard as the producers were looking for a young actress who appeared innocent, proud and yet shy, had class and could also play the piano. After auditioning over 70 actresses, Simon Langton suggested [[Emilia Fox]], the real-life daughter of Joanna David (Mrs Gardiner), for the part. [[Barbara Leigh-Hunt]] was cast as Darcy's meddling aunt, Lady Catherine de Bourgh, without auditions or screen tests.<ref name=bc_15-21 />\n\n== Production ==\n=== Conception and adaptation ===\n{{See also|#Themes and style}}\n[[Jane Austen]]'s novel ''[[Pride and Prejudice]]'' had already been the subject of [[Jane Austen in popular culture#Pride and Prejudice|numerous television and film adaptations]], including [[BBC]] television versions in 1938, 1952, 1958, 1967 and 1980. In the autumn of 1986, after watching a preview of Austen's ''[[Northanger Abbey]]'', [[Sue Birtwistle]] and [[Andrew Davies (writer)|Andrew Davies]] agreed to adapt ''Pride and Prejudice'', one of their favourite books, for television.<ref name=bc_v-viii>Birtwistle and Conklin 1995, pp. v\u2013viii.</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.aetv.com/scenes/pride/pride3f.html |title=Behind the scenes: Sue Birtwistle |publisher=aetv.com ([[A&E Network]]) |access-date=2004-04-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040407174333/http://www.aetv.com/scenes/pride/pride3f.html |archive-date=2004-04-07}}</ref> Birtwistle in particular felt that a new adaptation on [[film stock|film]] would serve the drama better than the previous [[videotape]]d ''Pride and Prejudice'' television adaptations, which looked too \"undernourished\" and \"unpoetic\".<ref name=bc_v-viii /> The needs of TV scheduling forced Davies to change his original plan of a five-episode adaptation to six.<ref name=bc_1-13 /> Birtwistle and Davies then offered the first three scripts to [[ITV Network|ITV]] in late 1986 to build on the guaranteed BBC audience, but the recent TV adaptation led to a delay. When ITV announced its renewed interest in 1993, [[Michael Wearing]] of the BBC commissioned the final scripts with co-funding from the American [[A&E Network]].<ref name=bc_v-viii /> Director [[Simon Langton (television director)|Simon Langton]] and the art department joined pre-production in January and February 1994.<ref name=bc_79-87 /><ref name=bc_35-43 />\n\n{{Quote box | quote=\"We treated the story with great respect, but if we wanted to be utterly faithful, we would have got someone to recite it over the radio.\" | source =\u2014Director [[Simon Langton (television director)|Simon Langton]]<ref name=20thcent /> | width  =250px | align  =right}}\nAlthough Birtwistle and Davies wished to remain true to the tone and spirit of the novel,<ref name=bc_1-13 /> they wanted to produce \"a fresh, lively story about real people\",<ref name=bc_v-viii /> not an \"old studio-bound BBC drama that was shown in the Sunday teatime slot\".<ref name=nyt_tale>{{cite news |last=Grimes |first=William |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9905E2DF1139F937A25752C0A960958260&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=all |title=Cover Story: An Austen Tale of Sex and Money In Which Girls Kick Up Their Heels |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=14 January 1996 |access-date=2008-05-17}}</ref> Emphasising sex and money as the themes of the story,<ref name=bc_v-viii /> Davies shifted the focus from Elizabeth to Elizabeth and Darcy and foreshadowed Darcy's role in the narrative resolution. To portray the characters as real human beings, Davies added short backstage scenes such as the Bennet girls dressing up to advertise themselves in the marriage market. New scenes where men pursue their hobbies with their peers departed from Jane Austen's focus on women.<ref name=bc_1-13>Birtwistle and Conklin 1995, pp. 1\u201313.</ref> The biggest technical difficulty proved to be adapting the long letters in the second half of the story. Davies employed techniques such as [[voice-over]]s, [[Flashback (narrative)|flashbacks]], and having the characters read the letters to themselves and to each other.

[[Luckington]] Court nearby served as the interior and exterior of Longbourn. [[Lyme Hall]] in [[Cheshire]] was chosen as Pemberley but management problems forced production to film Pemberley's interiors at [[Sudbury Hall]] in [[Sudbury, Derbyshire]].<ref name=bc_22-26>Birtwistle and Conklin 1995, pp. 22\u201326.</ref>\n\nThe producers found [[Belton House]] in [[Grantham, Lincolnshire]] the best match for Rosings, Lady Catherine de Bourgh's estate,<ref name=bc_22-26 /> which needed to appear \"over-the-top\" to reflect her disagreeableness.<ref name=dvd_making /> Old Rectory at [[Teigh]] in [[Rutland]] was chosen as Hunsford parsonage, Mr Collins's home. [[Edgcote#Edgcote House|Edgcote House]] in south-west [[Northamptonshire]] served as the interior and exterior of Bingley's Netherfield, along with [[Brocket Hall]] in [[Welwyn Garden City, Hertfordshire]] as the Netherfield ballroom.

Wickham's and Georgiana's planned elopement in [[Ramsgate]] was filmed in the English seaside resort [[Weston-super-Mare]] in [[Somerset]].<ref name=bc_22-26 /> Wickham's wedding takes place in [[St Paul's, Deptford|St Paul's in Deptford, London]].\n\n=== Costumes and make-up ===\nBecause ''Pride and Prejudice'' was a period drama, the design required more research than contemporary films. The personality and wealth of the characters were reflected in their costumes; the wealthy Bingley sisters were never shown in print dresses and they wore big feathers in their hair.<ref name=dvd_making /> As the BBC's stock of early 19th century costumes was limited, costume designer Dinah Collin designed most of the costumes, visiting museums for inspiration while trying to make the clothes attractive to a modern audience (although some costumes, mostly worn by extras, were re-used from earlier BBC productions or hired). Elizabeth's clothes had earthy tones and were fitted to allow easy and natural movements in line with the character's activity and liveliness. In contrast, Collin chose pale or creamy white colours for the clothes of the other Bennet girls to highlight their innocence and simplicity and richer colours for Bingley's sisters and Lady Catherine de Bourgh. Colin Firth participated in the wardrobe decisions and wanted his character to wear darker colours, leaving the warmer colours for Bingley.<ref name=bc_47-60>Birtwistle and Conklin 1995, pp. 47\u201360.</ref>\n\nThe producers imagined Darcy to be dark despite no such references in the novel and asked Firth to dye black his light-brown hair, eyebrows and lashes; they instructed all male actors to let their hair grow before filming and shave off their moustaches. Three brunette wigs were made to cover Ehle's short, blonde hair and one wig for Alison Steadman (Mrs. Bennet) because of her thick, heavy hair. Susannah Harker's (Jane) hair was slightly lightened to contrast with Elizabeth's and was arranged in a classic Greek style to highlight the character's beauty. Mary's plainness was achieved by painting spots on Lucy Briers's face; her hair was greased to suggest an unwashed appearance and was arranged to emphasise the actress's protruding ears. As Kitty and Lydia were too young and wild to have their hair done by the maids, the actresses' hair was not changed much. Makeup artist Caroline Noble had always considered Mr Collins a sweaty character with a moist upper lip; she also greased David Bamber's hair and gave him a low parting to suggest baldness.<ref name=bc_47-60 />\n\n=== Music and choreography ===\n[[File:Five positions of dancing Wilson 1811.jpg|thumb|The five positions of [[Regency dance|Regency dancing]], 1811]]\n[[Carl Davis]] had been writing scores for BBC adaptations of classic novels since the mid-1970s and approached Sue Birtwistle during pre-production. Aiming to communicate the wit and vitality of the novel and its theme of marriage and love in a small town in the early 19th century, he used contemporary classical music as inspiration, in particular a popular [[Beethoven]] [[septet]] of the period, as well as a theme strongly reminiscent of the finale of Beethoven's Emperor Concerto. For control over the sound, the music was recorded in six hours by a group of up to 18 musicians and was then fed into tiny earpieces of the screen musicians, who mimed playing the instruments. The actresses whose characters played the piano, Lucy Briers (Mary) and Emilia Fox (Georgiana), were already accomplished pianists and were given the opportunity to practise weeks ahead of filming.<ref>Birtwistle and Conklin 1995, pp. 61\u201366.</ref> Among the songs and movements that were played in the serial were [[Handel]]'s \"Air con Variazioni\"  from Suite No. 5 in E Major HWV 430 and \"[[Ombra mai f\u00f9|Slumber, Dear Maid]]\" from his opera ''[[Xerxes (opera)|Xerxes]]'',(Note:  in 1813 these works by Handel would have been considered quite old-fashioned, adding to the perception that Mary's tastes are a bit out of fashion.) [[Mozart]]'s \"[[Rondo alla turca]]\", \"[[Voi che sapete]]\" and other music from his operas ''[[The Marriage of Figaro]]'' and ''[[Don Giovanni]]'', Beethoven's ''[[Andante favori]]'', the second movement from [[Muzio Clementi]]'s Sonatina No.4 and the traditional folk song \"[[The Barley Mow]]\". A soundtrack with Davis's themes was released on CD in 1995.  The text of Mozart's \"Voi, che sapete\"(sung in an English translation) is a particularly meaningful choice:  the original Italian is a love song, including the words \"You, who know what love is, tell me, is that what I feel in my heart?\" Lizzie sings this, and soon after, she graciously \"saves\" Georgiana from embarrassment at the mention of Wickham, and Darcy further realizes her good heart.  This musical theme is soon echoed, after that episode, as Darcy walks along the hall; tell me, is love what I feel in my heart?\n\nMany scenes in the book were set at dances or balls. Jane Gibson based her choreography on ''The Apted Book of Country Dances'' (1966) by W.S. Porter, which had several late-18th-century dances by Charles and Samuel Thompson such as \"The Shrewsbury Lasses\", \"A Trip to Highgate\" and \"Mr. Beveridge's Maggot\". Although these dances gave the story an impression of authenticity, they were anachronistic, being out of fashion by the time of the story. Some fifteen dances were choreographed and rehearsed before filming. Polly Maberly and Julia Sawalha, the dance-mad Kitty and Lydia, had three days to learn the dances. Three days were allotted for the filming of the ball at Netherfield, whose pace and style concentrated on elegance rather than the community enjoying themselves as at the dance at Meryton.<ref>Birtwistle and Conklin 1995, pp. 67\u201372.</ref> The musicians and dancers had earpieces with music playing to allow dialogue recording.<ref name=bc_79-87>Birtwistle and Conklin 1995, pp. 79\u201387.</ref> Many wide-shots of Elizabeth's and Darcy's dance at Netherfield later turned out to be unusable because of a hair in front of a lens so the editors resorted to [[close-up]] shots and material provided by a [[steadicam]].<ref name=bc_107-113>Birtwistle and Conklin 1995, pp. 107\u2013113.</ref>\n\n== Themes and style ==\n{{See also|Pride and Prejudice#Major themes|Pride and Prejudice#Style}}\nThe adaptation received praise for its faithfulness to the novel,<ref name=\"heart_and_purse\" /><ref name=bfi_top100 /> which highlights the importance of environment and upbringing on peoples' development, although privilege is not necessarily advantageous.<ref name=\"Pinion\">{{cite book |last=Pinion |first=F B |title=A Jane Austen Companion |page=145 |publisher=[[Macmillan Publishers]] |year=1973 |isbn=978-0-333-12489-5 }}</ref> Describing the adaptation as \"a witty mix of love stories and social conniving, cleverly wrapped in the ambitions and illusions of a provincial gentry\",<ref name=\"heart_and_purse\" /> critics noted that Davies's focus on sex and money and Austen's wry, incisive humour and the \"deft\" characterisation, prevented the television adaptation from \"descending into the realm of a nicely-costumed, brilliantly-photographed melodrama\".<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.reelviews.net/reelviews/pride-prejudice | title=Pride & Prejudice }}</ref>\n\n{{Quote box | quote=\"It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune must be in want of a wife.\" | source =\u2014First line of Austen's novel ''Pride and Prejudice'' | width  =250px | align  =right}}\nTo avoid a narrator, the serial delegates the novel's first ironic sentence to Elizabeth in an early scene.<ref name=morrison>{{cite web |last=Morrison |first=Sarah R. |url=http://www.jasna.org/persuasions/on-line/opno3/morrison.html |title=Emma Minus Its Narrator: Decorum and Class Consciousness in Film Versions of the Novel |publisher=Persuasions On-Line |date=Fall 1999 |access-date=2008-07-04 |archive-date=4 October 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081004224429/http://www.jasna.org/persuasions/on-line/opno3/morrison.html |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=times_supplement>{{cite news |last=Macinnes |first=Carolyn |url=http://www.friendsoffirth.com/periodicals/96tes.html |title=The Times Educational Supplement |newspaper=[[The Times]] |year=1995 |access-date=2008-07-04 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.today/20090112115222/http://www.friendsoffirth.com/periodicals/96tes.html |archive-date=12 January 2009 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The adaptation opens with a view of Darcy's and Bingley's horses as they race across a field toward the Netherfield estate, expressing vitality; Elizabeth watches them before breaking into a run.
