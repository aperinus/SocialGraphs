The film was directed by [[Scott Sanders (director)|Scott Sanders]] and co-written by White, Sanders, and Byron Minns, who also co-stars.\n\nThe plot centers on former CIA agent Black Dynamite, who must avenge his brother's death while cleaning the streets of a new drug that is ravaging the community. The film is a [[parody]] of and [[Homage (arts)|homage]] to the blaxploitation genre and its era.  It had a trailer and funding even before a script was written. ''Black Dynamite'' was shot in 20 days in [[16 mm film#Super 16 mm|Super 16]] format. The film was released in the United States on October 16, 2009, for only two weeks (with an \"official\" premiere at the [[Toronto After Dark]] film festival) and was well received by critics. It was released on home video on February 16, 2010.\n\n==Plot==\nIn the early 1970s, Black Dynamite, a [[Vietnam veteran|Vietnam War veteran]] and former [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] officer, skilled in kung fu, vows to clean up the streets of drug dealers and gangsters after his younger brother Jimmy is killed by a shady organization. O'Leary, Black Dynamite's former [[United States Army|army]] and CIA partner, reinstates him into the agency because they do not want him seeking vengeance by himself. While trying to get to the bottom of Jimmy's murder, he finds out that his brother was actually working undercover for the CIA. Black Dynamite also discovers the shady organization is filling the black orphanages with [[heroin]]. He declares war on local drug dealers and successfully cleans up the streets, earning him the affection of Gloria, a [[Black Power]] activist who works at the local orphanage.\n\nAfter discovering the government's involvement in the drug ring, Black Dynamite steals the ledger belonging to corrupt Congressman James which details illegal shipments to a warehouse. Black Dynamite and his team (consisting of close friend Bullhorn, street hustler Cream Corn, militant leader Saheed, and three militants) storm the warehouse to capture a big shipment. They learn of a top-secret operation called \"Code Kansas\", but there are no drugs in the warehouse. They find only \"Anaconda\" brand [[malt liquor]], a government-produced brand that, according to the advertising slogan, \"Gives You Ooooooo!\". In a diner, they decipher the slogan and uncover \"Code Kansas\" as a plan to literally [[emasculate]] African-American men through Anaconda Malt Liquor, which is formulated to \"give (you) a little dick\". The militant Gunsmoke, who has fallen victim to the liquor's effect, is killed to put him out of his misery. Returning to the warehouse, Black Dynamite finds O'Leary is part of the evil plan but is just following orders. He kills O'Leary before acquiring his next lead to find the source of the \"Code Kansas\" plan.\n\nBlack Dynamite heads to Kung Fu Island, where he discovers that his old nemesis, Fiendish Dr. Wu, is responsible for creating the secret formula found in Anaconda Malt Liquor. In a protracted battle which kills Saheed, the three militants, and Bullhorn, Black Dynamite discovers the true identity of the mastermind of the entire operation - the [[White House]].\n\nBlack Dynamite then travels to the White House (in the process, Cream Corn is killed by the [[United States Secret Service|Secret Service]]) and confronts [[President of the United States|President]] [[Richard Nixon]], who has been giving the orders from the beginning. Black Dynamite engages Nixon in a kung-fu battle. Nixon gets the upper hand when he dishonestly pulls [[John Wilkes Booth]]'s gun, but the [[Lincoln's ghost|ghost of Abraham Lincoln]] appears and disarms Nixon with kung-fu. After defeating Nixon in a fair fight, Black Dynamite threatens to [[Watergate scandal|expose Nixon]] as the subject of a series of [[Bondage (BDSM)|bondage]] and [[cross-dressing]] photographs. The president begs to be killed but Black Dynamite refuses to give him \"the easy way out\" and has Nixon watch out for his people. The film concludes with a monologue from Black Dynamite on his quest for justice as Gloria and [[Pat Nixon]] watch on rapturously.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Michael Jai White]] as Black Dynamite\n** Jon Kent Ethridge as 12-year-old Black Dynamite\n** Neil Lewis as 18-year-old Black Dynamite\n* [[Salli Richardson]] as Gloria Gray<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.fightsmackintheorphanage.org/about-us |title=Fight Smack in the Orphanage - About Us |access-date=July 27, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100715051422/http://www.fightsmackintheorphanage.org/about-us |archive-date=July 15, 2010 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n* [[Arsenio Hall]] as \"Tasty Freeze\"\n* [[Kevin Chapman]] as O'Leary\n* [[Tommy Davidson]] as \"Cream Corn\"\n* [[Obba Babatund\u00e9]] as Osiris\n* [[Richard Edson]] as Dino\n* [[Buddy Lewis (comedian)|Buddy Lewis]] as \"Gunsmoke\"\n* [[Brian McKnight]] as \"Sweetmeat\"\n* [[Nicole Ari Parker]] as Mahogany Black\n* Byron Minns as \"Bullhorn\"\n* James McManus as [[Richard Nixon]]\n* [[Phil Morris (actor)|Phil Morris]] as Saheed\n* [[Miguel A.

For example, in one scene where Black Dynamite stands up from his desk, a red [[Boom operator (media)|boom microphone]] appears above his head (which was common in [[Rudy Ray Moore]] films, such as ''[[Dolemite]]''). Some of the actors recite their stage directions before their intended dialogue; in one scene, an actor verbalizes the stage direction written into a film script (\"the militants turn startled\"), and continues saying the scripted dialogue \"How did you get in here?\" (which causes Ferrante Jones, the actor playing \"Black Dynamite,\" to [[break character]] and look offscreen to see if the director will realize the error and call \"cut\" - which the unseen director does not do).<ref name=\"chudinterview\" />\n\nDuring casting, White sent [[Arsenio Hall]] the script, and \"when he read that there's a [[Captain Kangaroo]] pimp in this thing,\" he accepted the role.<ref name=\"spoutinterview\">{{cite web |url=http://blog.spout.com/2009/01/24/michael-jai-white-and-scott-sanders-interview-black-dynamite-sundance-2009/ |title=Michael Jai White and Scott Sanders Interview, Black Dynamite, Sundance 2009 |author=Kelly, Kevin |work=Spoutblog.com |access-date=2010-03-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090131095718/http://blog.spout.com/2009/01/24/michael-jai-white-and-scott-sanders-interview-black-dynamite-sundance-2009/ |archive-date=January 31, 2009 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\n===Score===\n[[Adrian Younge]] plays all instruments and wrote the lyrics to every song on the soundtrack except \"Shine\", \"Cleaning Up The Streets\", and \"Gloria\".

Morricone greatly influenced Younge from the classical European funk music, while Wu-Tang Clan helped him focus on making music they would want to sample.
