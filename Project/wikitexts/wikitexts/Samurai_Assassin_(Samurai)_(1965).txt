He joins forces with the multiple clans against the Lord of Hikone, Sir Ii Kamonnokami Naosuke. Ii is the right hand of the shogunate and brought upon himself the wrath of the Satsuma, Mito, and Choshuu provinces after making an unpopular choice for the appointment of the 14th shogunate. Many critics arose after the controversial appointment, and Ii initiated the Ansei Purge to quiet critics of his choices. This, in turn, led to an assassination plot hatched by the three provinces in order to remove Ii from his position of power. The shoguns also weeding out Ii's spies from the plot. The film is based on a novel, which in turn was inspired by the historical [[Sakuradamon incident (1860)|Sakuradamon incident]], in which the feudal lord [[Ii Naosuke]] was assassinated outside the Sakurada Gate of [[Edo Castle]].\n\n== Cast ==\n*[[Toshiro Mifune]] - Tsuruchiyo Niiro\n*[[Keiju Kobayashi]] - Einosuke Kurihara\n*[[Michiyo Aratama]] - Okiku / Kikuhime\n*[[Y\u016bnosuke It\u014d]] - Kenmotsu Hoshino\n*[[Eijir\u014d T\u014dno]] - Masagoro Kisoya\n*Tatsuyoshi Ehara - Ichigoro Hayama\n*Tadao Nakamaru - Shigezo Inada\n*[[Kaoru Yachigusa]] - Mitsu\n*[[Haruko Sugimura]] - Tsuru\n*Nami Tamura - Yae\n*Shiro Otsuji - Kaname Kojima\n*[[Toshio Kurosawa (actor)|Toshio Kurosawa]] - Itamura Katsunoshin\n*[[Yoshio Inaba]] - Keijiro Sumita\n*[[Akihiko Hirata]] - Sohei Masui\n*[[Hideyo Amamoto]] - Matazaburo Hagiwara\n*[[Takashi Shimura]] - Narihisa Ichij\u014d\n*[[Matsumoto Haku\u014d I|Matsumoto K\u014dshir\u014d VIII]] - [[Ii Naosuke]]\n\n==Production==\n''Samurai Assassin'' was a production of both [[Toho]] and Mifune Productions.{{sfn|Galbraith IV|2008|p=216}} It is based on the book ''Samurai Japan'' by Jiromasa Gunji.{{sfn|Galbraith IV|2008|p=216}}\n\n==Release==\n''Samurai Assassin'' was released in Japan on January 3, 1965.{{sfn|Galbraith IV|2008|p=216}} The film was released in the United States on March 18, 1965 where it was distributed by Toho International.{{sfn|Galbraith IV|2008|p=216}} The film's title was apparently changed from ''Samurai'' to ''Samurai Assassin'' in the United States to avoid confusion with [[Hiroshi Inagaki]]'s film [[Samurai I: Musashi Miyamoto|''Samurai'' (''Miyamoto Musashi'')]] from 1954.{{sfn|Galbraith IV|2008|p=216}}\n\n==Reception==\nIn a contemporary review, \"Robe.\" of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' declared that samurai film was not \"superb\" but \"very good\", noting that [[Toshiro Mifune]] and \"the entire cast, particularly the men, give excellent portrayals\" and that Hiroshi Murai's \"crisp black and white photography is more effective in the outdoor, dead-of-winter panoramas and fight scenes\"<ref name=\"variety-book\">{{cite book|title=Variety's Film Reviews 1964-1967|volume=11|publisher=R.
