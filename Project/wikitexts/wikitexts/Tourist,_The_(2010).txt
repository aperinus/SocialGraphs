Henckel von Donnersmarck repeatedly stated it was neither genre, calling it \"a travel romance with thriller elements,\" but that if he had to choose between the two, he would choose comedy.<ref name=HR121410>Tim Appelo, [https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/blogs/race/globe-comedy-nom-tourist-funny-59606 Globe Comedy Nom for 'The Tourist': Now, That's Funny], ''The Hollywood Reporter'', December 14, 2010, accessed February 2, 2011.</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nA British woman, Elise Clifton-Ward ([[Angelina Jolie]]), is being followed through downtown [[Paris]] by French police who are working with [[Scotland Yard]] under the direction of Inspector John Acheson ([[Paul Bettany]]). Acheson has spent years hunting Alexander Pearce, Elise's lover, who owes \u00a3744 million in back taxes, and is believed to have received plastic surgery to alter his appearance. He is also being hunted by Reginald Shaw ([[Steven Berkoff]]), a mobster from whom Pearce stole $2.3 billion. At a Parisian cafe, Elise receives written instructions from Pearce: board the train to [[Venice]], [[Italy]]; pick out a man; and let the police believe that he is Pearce. Elise burns the note, evades the police, and boards the train.\n\nOn the train, Elise selects Frank Tupelo ([[Johnny Depp]]), a mathematics teacher from a community college in [[Wisconsin]]. Acheson salvages information about the plan from the remains of the burned note. Aware of her location, but not of the ruse, a policeman on Shaw's payroll alerts Shaw that Pearce is on the train to Venice with Elise. Shaw immediately proceeds to Venice.\n\nIn Venice, Elise invites Frank to stay with her at the [[Hotel Danieli]], where she receives instructions from Pearce to attend a ball. She abandons Frank, who is then chased by Shaw's men. While trying to escape, he is detained by the Italian police, and a corrupt inspector attempts to turn him over to Shaw's men for a bounty. Elise rescues Frank just before he is handed over, leading Shaw's men on an extended boat chase before finally escaping. She leaves Frank at the airport with his passport and money, urging him to go home for his own safety.\n\nElise goes to see Acheson, who has come to Venice, and is revealed to be an undercover Scotland Yard agent who was under suspension for her suspected sympathies with Pearce. She agrees to participate in a sting operation to bring Pearce to justice. As she tries to find Pearce at the ball, a man places an envelope on her table and disappears into the crowd. She tries to follow him, but is stopped by Frank, who claims to be in love with her and invites her to dance. The police arrive and take Frank into protective custody. Elise reads the note and leaves in her boat, tailed by Shaw and the police.\n\nWhen Elise gets to the house to which Pearce's note directed her, Shaw takes her hostage, threatening to harm her unless she reveals the location of a hidden safe where Pearce is keeping the stolen money. The police monitor the situation from outside, and Acheson repeatedly refuses to allow Italian police snipers to intervene to rescue Elise. While the police are distracted monitoring the situation, Frank escapes and confronts Shaw, claiming to be Pearce and offering to open the safe if Elise is allowed to leave. Shaw tells Frank to open the safe or he will have Elise tortured. Chief Inspector Jones arrives at the police stake-out, overrides Acheson, and orders the snipers to fire, killing Shaw and his men. Then, to Elise's obvious pleasure, Jones lifts her suspension and fires her.\n\nAcheson receives a message that Pearce has been found nearby, but, on arrival, he learns the police have detained an Englishman who says he is only a tourist being paid to follow instructions and is not Pearce. Elise tells Frank that she loves him, but she also loves Pearce. Frank opens the safe by entering the correct code, revealing that he was Alexander Pearce all along. When the police come back and open the safe with explosives, they find a check for \u00a3744 million. Acheson wants to keep pursuing Pearce, but, since the taxes are now paid, Jones closes the case. Pearce and Elise sail away together.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Angelina Jolie]] as Elise Clifton-Ward\n* [[Johnny Depp]] as Frank Tupelo/Alexander Pearce\n* [[Paul Bettany]] as Inspector John Acheson\n* [[Timothy Dalton]] as Chief Inspector Jones\n* [[Steven Berkoff]] as Reginald Shaw\n* [[Rufus Sewell]] as The Englishman/Lawrence Mason\n* [[Christian De Sica]] as Colonnello Lombardi\n* [[Alessio Boni]] as Sergeant Cerato\n* [[Daniele Pecci]] as Tenente Narduzzi\n* Giovanni Guidelli as Tenente Tommassini\n* [[Raoul Bova]] as Conte Filippo Gaggia\n* [[Bruno Wolkowitch]] as Capitaine Courson\n* [[Mhamed Arezki]] as Achmed Tchebali\n* [[Marc Ruchmann]] as Brigadier Kaiser\n* Julien Baumgartner as Brigadier Ricuort\n* Fran\u00e7ois Vincentelli as Brigadier Marion\n* [[Nino Frassica]] as Brigadier Mele\n* [[Igor Jijikine]] as Virginsky\n* [[Neri Marcor\u00e8]] as Alessio, the hotel concierge\n* [[Renato Scarpa]] as Arturo, a tailor\n* [[Maurizio Casagrande]] as Antonio, a waiter\n* [[Giovanni Esposito (comedian)|Giovanni Esposito]] as Coppa, an interpreter\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\nThe project went through a number of directorial and cast changes. Originally, [[Lasse Hallstr\u00f6m]] was set to direct, with [[Charlize Theron]] to play the female lead. After Hallstr\u00f6m left, allegedly over scheduling conflicts, [[Bharat Nalluri]] came on board, and then [[Tom Cruise]] was announced to play the male lead, though he was later replaced by [[Sam Worthington]]. When Jolie accepted her role, so did director [[Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck]], but he, along with Worthington subsequently left, citing \"creative differences\". After many other directors were considered, including [[Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n]], Henckel von Donnersmarck returned, re-wrote the script in two weeks, and shot the film in 58 days (including 2nd unit days), with [[Johnny Depp]] as the male lead.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\nFilming began in [[Paris]] with Jolie on February 23, 2010,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.popsugar.com/Pictures-Brad-Pitt-Angelina-Jolie-Date-Bosnia-His-Parents-Arriving-Venice-8049640 |title=See Brad and Angelina's Bosnia Date Night Before His Parents Arrived in Venice! |publisher=PopSugar.com |date=April 14, 2010 |access-date=October 8, 2010}}</ref> before moving to [[Venice]], where Depp joined the production on March 1.

In the DVD director's commentary, Henckel von Donnersmarck recounts that the film's one action sequence was devised by Crane to allow for the speed limitations imposed on boats in Venice. This speed limit was strictly enforced by the Venetian authorities, and there was a policeman on set at all times to make sure no wave movement caused the pillars on which the palazzi are built to be exposed to oxygen. Henckel von Donnersmarck and Crane felt that if one boat was towing the other, this could perhaps be a realistic reason for a slow speed chase.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\nThe whole film was made in only a little over 11 months, counting from the day Henckel von Donnersmarck came on board to re-write and direct to the day of the premiere in New York. It had to be shot so quickly because Depp had to leave for Hawaii to start filming the fourth film of the ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean (film series)|Pirates of the Caribbean]]'' franchise. The reason post-production had to happen so quickly was because all commercially interesting release dates in 2011 were reserved for the potential start of ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides]]''.\n\n==Themes==\n===Janus symbolism===\n[[File:Janus1.JPG|thumb|right|God Janus]]\n\nThe film repeatedly uses symbolism revolving around the Roman god [[Janus]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://newcityfilm.com/2010/12/10/review-the-tourist/ |title=Review: The Tourist |date=December 10, 2010 |website=NewCityFilm.com |publisher=Newcity Communications, Inc. |access-date=July 30, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pluggedin.com/videos/2011/q1/tourist.aspx |title=The Tourist: Video Review |year=2011 |author=Paul Asay |website=PluggedIn.com |publisher=[[Focus on the Family]] |access-date=July 30, 2013}}</ref> In particular:\n\n*At a dinner in Venice, Frank asks Elise about her bracelet, and she replies:\n\n{{blockquote|quote=It's the Roman god, Janus.
