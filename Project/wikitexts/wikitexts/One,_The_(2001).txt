Li plays a [[dual role]] as Yulaw and Gabe Law, an [[Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department|LASD]] deputy sheriff who teams up with a multiverse agent to prevent Yulaw from becoming the One.\n\nThe film was released in the United States by [[Columbia Pictures]] on November 2, 2001, and received negative critical reviews but grossed $78,5 million worldwide.\n\n==Plot==\nGabriel Yulaw ([[Jet Li]]), once an agent of the MultiVerse Authority (MVA) which polices [[dimension|interdimensional]] travel, seeks to hunt down all variations of himself in [[parallel universe (fiction)|alternate universes]]. By killing 124 versions of his other selves and absorbing their life energies, Yulaw believes that he will become a superpowered-godlike being called \"The One\".\n\nAfter killing Lawless, the 123rd variation in the Anubis Universe, Yulaw is captured by MVA agents Roedecker ([[Delroy Lindo]]) and Funsch ([[Jason Statham]]) and taken back to the MVA headquarters in the Alpha Universe. After he is sentenced to life in the [[Styx|Stygian]] penal colony in the Hades Universe, Yulaw manages to escape with the help of his lover and teleports to the Charis Universe where the last variation of himself lives.\n\nThe last known variation, Gabe Law, is a deputy sheriff working in the [[Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department]]. For two years, Gabe has been experiencing increases in strength, speed, and mental ability, but neither he nor his wife T.K. ([[Carla Gugino]]) can understand why. While transporting a prisoner, Gabe \"feels\" Yulaw's presence in time to avoid being shot. Gabe sustains an injury after falling from a wall which Yulaw scales with ease. Roedecker and Funsch arrive in time to stop Yulaw from finishing off Gabe.\n\nAlthough unfamiliar with interdimensional travel, Gabe realizes that Yulaw is identical to him in every way. Rodecker and Funsch track Yulaw to the hospital where Gabe is being examined. Yulaw deters them from shooting him because if he is killed, Gabe would then be left as the One. Dressed alike and identical to each other, Gabe and Yulaw's battle confuses the other police officers. Both Gabe and Yulaw manage to escape the hospital.\n\nThe MVA agents deviate from their orders and split up. Roedecker pursues and fights Yulaw but is killed when the latter breaks his neck, disabling a bomb Roedecker intended to use to finish both of them off. Funsch catches up with Gabe and explains to him that there are [[multiverse theory|multiple universes]] with wormholes briefly connecting them at uncontrollable times. Yulaw sneaks into Gabe's residence where T.K., believing him to be Gabe, agrees to hide him from the police. She realizes that Yulaw is deceiving her but not in time to avoid being captured. Gabe arrives, only to watch helplessly as Yulaw kills T.K. Funsch finds a guilt-ridden Gabe and both team up to find Yulaw at the next wormhole.\n\nGabe and Funsch arrive at an industrial plant, where they encounter and fight Yulaw. Funsch is easily defeated but Gabe and Yulaw are more evenly matched. Gabe manages to gain the upper hand but only seconds before the wormhole arrives. All three of them are sucked into it and collapse on the floor of the MVA headquarters. Yulaw is transported immediately to the Hades Universe after a failed attempt to switch places with Gabe. The MVA then prepares to send Gabe back to his own universe, where he will be arrested and put into prison for the crimes that Yulaw committed. Recalling an earlier conversation with Gabe, Funsch compassionately sends him to a different universe in which Gabe can have a normal life again from when he first met T.K.\n\nMeanwhile, Yulaw, now on the penal colony in the Hades Universe, declares that he will still become the One and then proceeds to battle a prison inmate. The camera then pulls back to show an army of other prison inmates taking on Yulaw on top of a [[ziggurat]].\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Jet Li]] as:\n** Gabriel Yulaw, a former [[Multiverse]] Authority (M.V.A.) agent from Alpha Universe and the [[main antagonist]] of the film.\n** Officer Gabe Law, an [[Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department|LASD]] [[deputy sheriff]] and [[martial artist]] from [[Charis]] Universe and the [[main protagonist]] of the film. \n** Lawless, a notorious and violent criminal from [[Anubis]] Universe and one of Yulaw's victims.\n** Tsang Law, one of Yulaw's victims from a unknown Universe.\n** Yu Fook Law, a [[rastafari]] from [[Monoceros]] Universe and one of Yulaw's victims.\n** Swen Law, a [[surfer]] from [[Tucana]] Universe and one of Yulaw's victims.\n** Ni Dilaw, one of Yulaw's victims from [[Canopus]] Universe.\n** Kia Jilaw, one of Yulaw's victims from [[Serpens]] Universe.\n** Seth Law, a long haired man and  one of Yulaw's victims from [[Procyon]] Universe.\n** Frum Law, one of Yulaw's victims from [[Shaula]] Universe.\n* [[Jason Statham]] as Agent Evan Funsch, a Multiverse Authority (M.V.A.) agent from Alpha Universe and Agent Rodecker's current partner.\n* [[Delroy Lindo]] as: \n** Agent Harry Rodecker, a [[Multiverse]] Authority (M.V.A.) agent from Alpha Universe who is Yulaw's [[archenemy]] and former partner.\n** Arri, a gas station attendant from Charis Universe.\n* [[Carla Gugino]] as:\n** T.K.
