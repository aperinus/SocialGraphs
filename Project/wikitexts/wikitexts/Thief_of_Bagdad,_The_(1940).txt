The screenplay is by [[Lajos B\u00edr\u00f3|Lajos Biro]] and [[Miles Malleson]], who also appears in the film as the Princess's father, the Sultan of Basra.\n\n==Plot==\nIn ancient [[Basra]], a blind, young beggar begins telling the film's story in [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]] (mimicking the style of the ''[[One Thousand and One Nights|Arabian Nights]]''), revealing that he is really Ahmad, the young, naive Sultan of [[Baghdad|Bagdad]]. Wanting to know more about his people, Ahmad is tricked by Jaffar, his evil [[Grand Vizier]], into going in disguise into the city. Jaffar then has him arrested and seizes the throne. In prison, Ahmad meets the young thief Abu, who arranges their escape. They flee to Basra, where Ahmad meets and falls in love with the Princess. Jaffar, however, also journeys to Basra, intent on having the Princess for himself.\n\nJaffar, a powerful [[Magician (fantasy)|sorcerer]], provides the toy-obsessed Sultan of Basra with a mechanical [[flying horse]] in exchange for the promise of marriage to his daughter. The Princess, now in love with Ahmad, runs away, but Jaffar blinds Ahmad and turns Abu into a dog. The Princess is captured for the slave market and is bought by Jaffar's agent. At the palace, though, she falls into a deep sleep and cannot be awakened. Halima, Jaffar's minion, tricks Ahmad into awakening the Princess. He is then dismissed with the dog to the city's docks, where he concludes his story.\n\nThe Princess is tricked into boarding a ship, where she is met by Jaffar who tells her that she can cure Ahmad's blindness only by allowing Jaffar to embrace her. She submits and the spells are lifted from both Ahmad and Abu. Jaffar prevents the two from following him by raising a storm that shipwrecks them. Returning to Basra, Jaffar uses a mechanical dancer to kill the Princess's father. He then goes back to Bagdad with the Princess.\n\nAbu awakes on a deserted beach, where he finds a bottle and opens it, releasing an enormous [[Djinn|genie]] so embittered by his long imprisonment he intends to kill the boy.  Abu tricks the genie into submitting to him and granting him three wishes. The first wish is wasted, but the genie helps Abu to steal a magical jewel that enables him to find Ahmad. With his second wish, Abu is reunited with Ahmad. With the jewel, Ahmad sees Jaffar using his magic to make the Princess forget her true love. Despondent, Ahmad quarrels with Abu, who inadvertently uses his third wish to send Ahmad back to Bagdad.\n\nIn Bagdad, Ahmad is reunited with the Princess who remembers him. They are imprisoned by Jaffar and condemned to death. Abu helplessly witnesses all this with the jewel's aid. In anger, he destroys the jewel, which frees the \"Old King\" of the \"Land of Legend.\"  Abu is given a magic crossbow as a reward. He steals the king's [[magic carpet]] and flies on it to Bagdad. Abu's appearance fulfills an ancient prophecy and sparks a revolt against Jaffar by the city's inhabitants. Abu kills the fleeing Jaffar with the crossbow. Ahmad is restored to power and reunited with the Princess. Abu, alarmed by Ahmad's plans to educate him to become the vizier, flies off on the carpet in search of fun and adventure.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Conrad Veidt]] as Jaffar\n* [[Sabu Dastagir|Sabu]] as Abu\n* [[June Duprez]] as the Princess\n* [[John Justin]] as Ahmad\n* [[Rex Ingram (actor)|Rex Ingram]] as the Djinn\n* [[Miles Malleson]] as the Sultan of Basra\n* [[Morton Selten]] as the Old King\n* [[Mary Morris]] as Halima, Jaffar's agent, and the \"Silver Maid\"\n* Bruce Winston as the Merchant\n* [[Hay Petrie]] as the Astrologer\n* [[Adelaide Hall]] as the Singer\n* [[Roy Emerton]] as the Jailor\n* [[Allan Jeayes]] as the Story Teller\n* [[Robert Greig]] as Man of Basra (uncredited)\n\nDuprez's character is unnamed; she is simply referred to as \"The Princess\", and addressed as \"Princess\", \"my dear\", etc.\n\nKorda had intended to cast [[Vivien Leigh]] as the Princess, but she went to Hollywood to be with [[Laurence Olivier]].<ref>[[Robert Osborne]], [[Turner Classic Movies]]</ref>\n\n==Production==\nProducer Alexander Korda, after a search for a director, chose German filmmaker [[Ludwig Berger (director)|Ludwig Berger]] in early 1939, but by the early summer became dissatisfied with Berger's overall conception of the movie\u2014feeling it was too small-scale and intimate\u2014and, specifically, the score that Berger proposed to use. Essentially behind Berger's back, British director [[Michael Powell]] was brought in to shoot various scenes\u2014and Powell's scheduled work grew in amount and importance while, in the meantime, Korda himself did his best to undercut Berger on his own set; and while publicly siding with Berger on the issue of the music, he also undercut Berger's chosen composer ([[Oscar Straus (composer)|Oscar Straus]]) by bringing in [[Miklos Rozsa]] and putting him into an office directly adjacent to Berger's with a piano, to work on a score. Eventually, Berger was persuaded to walk away from the project, and American filmmaker [[Tim Whelan]], who had just finished work on another Korda-produced movie (''[[Q Planes]]'') was brought in to help augment Powell's work. However, work was suspended with the outbreak of the Second World War in September 1939, for Powell was taken off the picture and put to work on the morale-boosting documentary ''[[The Lion Has Wings]]''.\n\nBy the end of the year, Korda found himself running out of money and credit, and in the spring of 1940 he arranged to move the entire production to Hollywood (where some shots of the movie's young star Sabu had to be redone, for he had grown more than {{convert|3|in}} during the year since shooting had commenced). Powell remained in England, so direction was taken up in Hollywood by [[William Cameron Menzies|Menzies]] and [[Zoltan Korda]] during the summer of 1940\u2014including shots of the heroes in the [[Grand Canyon]], [[Monument Valley]], [[Bryce Canyon]]<ref>{{cite book |last1=D'Arc |first1=James V. |title=When Hollywood came to town: a history of moviemaking in Utah |date=2010 |publisher=Gibbs Smith|location=Layton, UT |isbn=9781423605874 |edition=1st}}</ref>{{rp|287}} and the [[Painted Desert (Arizona)|Painted Desert]]; the scenes in the Temple of the Goddess of Light, among the last to be written, were done late in the summer, and the film was being edited and re-structured into the fall of 1940.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\nAt some point during production, the film was being written as a musical.

For example, the Disney film ''[[Aladdin (1992 Disney film)|Aladdin]]'' borrows freely from it, particularly the characters of the evil Vizier and the Sultan, both drawn with a marked similarity to the characters in ''The Thief of Bagdad''. The villain Jafar is named after the character played by Conrad Veidt, himself named after the historical vizier [[Ja'far ibn Yahya]], who served [[Harun ar-Rashid]].<ref>{{cite book |last =Rovin |first =Jeff |title =The Encyclopedia of Supervillains |publisher =Facts on File |date =1987 |location =New York |isbn = 0-8160-1356-X |pages=168\u2013169}}</ref> Like the sultan of the earlier film, Disney's Sultan is obsessed with toys.
