The film portrays the life of [[Sid Vicious]], bassist of the [[punk rock]] band the [[Sex Pistols]], and his destructive relationship with girlfriend [[Nancy Spungen]]. The film also features supporting performances from [[David Hayman]], [[Xander Berkeley]], and [[Courtney Love]].\n\nThe film premiered at the [[Cannes Film Festival]] in  May 1986, and was released theatrically in the United States in November of that same year.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1986-11-07-8603230774-story.html | title=LOVE STORY BRINGS WARMTH TO VIOLENT `SID & NANCY`}}</ref> Although it failed to recoup its production budget at the box office, the film was received positively by most critics and developed a [[cult following]].\n\n==Plot==\nOn 12 October 1978, police are summoned to the [[Hotel Chelsea]] in [[New York City]], where they find  [[Nancy Spungen]] dead. Her boyfriend, [[Sex Pistols]] bassist [[Sid Vicious]], is taken into custody. Sid is driven to a police station and told to describe what happened. \n\nA little more than a year earlier, in 1977, close friends and band members Sid and [[John Lydon|Johnny Rotten]] meet Nancy, a [[heroin]]-addicted American [[groupie]] who had come to [[London]] to bed the [[Sex Pistols]]. Sid dismisses her at first, as her intentions are obvious, but begins dating her after feeling sympathy for the rejection she faces from fellow punk performers. The two swiftly bond over heroin use, and it is implied that Nancy introduces Sid to the drug.\n\nSid and Nancy fall deeply in love, but their self-destructive, drug-fueled relationship frays Sid's relationship with the rest of the band. Nancy is distraught when Sid departs on a month-long American tour without her. The tour is notably disastrous, with Sid strung out of his mind, often drunk or on [[methamphetamine]], and physically violent. Phoebe, Sid's friend and road manager, unsuccessfully attempts to help him stop drinking. Meanwhile, Nancy remains in London, staying with her friend Linda, a [[dominatrix]]. Although several of Sid's friends and acquaintances warn him of Nancy's devastating effect on his life, Sid stubbornly ignores these warnings. On 17 January 1978, in the midst of the group's American tour, the band breaks up.\n\nSid reunites with Nancy in New York City, and he attempts to start a solo career with Nancy as his manager. The two visit [[Paris]] to begin recording sessions, but the trip is unfruitful. Sid is quickly dismissed in the music industry as a has-been, and he and Nancy descend deeper into heroin addiction; Nancy also begins suffering from severe [[Clinical depression|depression]], and the couple eventually make a [[suicide pact]]. Nancy brings Sid to [[Philadelphia]] to meet her family, who are horrified by the couple's reckless behavior and physical state. Sid and Nancy return to New York and settle in the Hotel Chelsea, where they live in squalor and depend on [[opiates]] supplied by their drug dealer, Bowery Snax.\n\nTheir love affair ends tragically one night when, during an argument in which Sid announces his plans to stop using heroin and return to [[England]] to restart his life, a suicidal Nancy begs him to kill her. She attacks him and they fight in a drug-induced haze, leading to him stabbing her, although whether it was intentional is left to interpretation. They fall asleep and later Nancy awakes and stumbles into the bathroom, where she collapses and dies. Sid is bailed out temporarily by his mother, who is also a heroin addict. After Sid wanders to a pizzeria and eats a pizza, some street kids convince him to dance with them. A taxi appears and picks Sid up, and he believes he finds Nancy alive in the back seat. The two embrace as the cab drives off.\n\nA [[postscript]] says that Vicious died of a [[drug overdose|heroin overdose]], and lastly reads: \"R.I.P. Nancy and Sid.\"\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast list|\n* [[Gary Oldman]] as [[Sid Vicious]]\n* [[Chloe Webb]] as [[Nancy Spungen]]\n* [[David Hayman]] as [[Malcolm McLaren]]\n* [[Debby Bishop]] as Phoebe\n* [[Andrew Schofield (actor)|Andrew Schofield]] as [[John Lydon|Johnny Rotten]]\n* [[Xander Berkeley]] as Bowery Snax\n* [[Perry Benson]] as [[Paul Cook]]\n* Tony London as [[Steve Jones (musician)|Steve Jones]]\n* [[Courtney Love]] as Gretchen\n* [[Edward Tudor-Pole]] as U.K. Hotelier\n* [[Kathy Burke]] as Brenda Windzor \n* [[Sara Sugarman]] as Abby National \n* Graham Fletcher-Cook as Wally Hairstyle\n* [[Sy Richardson]] as Methadone Case Worker\n* [[Anne Lambton]] as Linda\n* [[Mark Monero]] as Jah Clive\n* [[Biff Yeager]] as Detective\n* Michele Winstanley as Olive McBollocks\n* Andy Bradford as Dick Bent\n* [[Pete Lee-Wilson|Peter Lee-Wilson]] as Duke Bowman\n* [[Gloria LeRoy]] as Grandma \n* [[Milton Selzer]] as Grandpa \n* [[Iggy Pop]] as Prospective Guest\n* Barbara Coles as Reporter\n}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nThe film, originally titled ''Love Kills'', is largely based on the mutually destructive, drug- and sex-filled relationship between Vicious and Nancy. Vicious' mother, Anne Beverley, initially tried to prevent the film from being made. After meeting with director Cox, however, she decided to help the production; for example, Beverley gave Oldman Vicious' own heavy metal chain and padlock to wear in the film. Some of the supporting characters are composites, invented to streamline the plot.\n\n===Casting===\nAccording to director Cox, he had originally considered [[Daniel Day-Lewis]] for the part of Sid Vicious;<ref name=vt>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2013/mar/06/sid-nancy-reel-history-alex-cox|work=The Guardian|title=Sid and Nancy: an intriguing glimpse into a dysfunctional relationship|author=Von Tunzelmann, Alex|date=6 March 2013|access-date=16 May 2017}}</ref> however, Cox offered Oldman the part of Vicious after seeing him play the lead role of Scopey in a 1984 production of [[Edward Bond]]'s ''The Pope's Wedding''. Oldman twice turned down the role before accepting it, because, in his own words: \"I wasn't really that interested in Sid Vicious and the punk movement. I'd never followed it. It wasn't something that interested me. The script I felt was banal and 'who cares' and 'why bother' and all of that. And I was a little bit sort-of with my nose in the air and sort-of thinking 'well the theatre \u2013 so much more superior' and all of that.\" He reconsidered based on the salary and the urging of his agent.<ref>Gary Oldman interview by [[Terry Gross]].

The stabbing scene is fictionalized and based only on conjecture.

He used as his point of reference \u2013 of all the people on this earth \u2013 [[Joe Strummer]]! That guttural singer from [[The Clash]]? What the fuck did he know about Sid and Nancy? That\u2019s probably all he could find, which was really scraping the bottom of the barrel. The only time Alex Cox made any approach toward me was when he sent the [[Andrew Schofield (actor)|chap who was playing me]] over to New York where I was. This actor told me he wanted to talk about the script. During the two days he was there, he told me that the film had already been completed. The whole thing was a sham. It was a ploy to get my name used in connection with the film, in order to support it.\n\nTo me this movie is the lowest form of life. I honestly believe that it celebrates heroin addiction. It definitely glorifies it at the end when that stupid taxi drives off into the sky. That's such nonsense...&nbsp; It was so off and ridiculous. It was absurd. Champagne and baked beans for breakfast? Sorry. I don't drink champagne. He didn't even speak like me. He had a [[Scouse]] accent. Worse, there's a slur implied in the movie that I was jealous of Nancy, which I find particularly loathsome. There is that implication that I feel was definitely put there.

According to Cox, Lydon noticed that Schofield was, like Cox, a [[Liverpudlian]], rather than a Londoner like Lydon, and encouraged him to play the part as a [[Scouser]] rather than a Londoner. Cox took this as a sign that both of them agreed that it would be better to portray a more fictionalized version of the characters rather than a cold re-telling of facts. Cox claims that Lydon drank heavily at these meetings, which may explain why Lydon did not recall them. Cox stated in a book that contrary to Lydon's claims, his meeting with Schofield was not after the film's completion, but rather before Schofield had even been given the part. He was offered the part the next day.{{Sfn|Cox|2008|p=89}}\n\n==Awards and nominations==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n! Award\n! Category\n! Recipient(s)\n!

Much of the film's soundtrack (as opposed to soundtrack album) was composed by [[Dan Wool]] (of Pray for Rain) and [[Joe Strummer]], who was contractually limited to contribute only two songs. Strummer continued to contribute more (unpaid) work because of his interest in the project and composing for film in general. This additional material was credited to fictitious bands in the credits, so as to keep Strummer's label, [[Epic Records]], from knowing what he had done. Another large portion of the music was composed by [[The Pogues]].\n\n{| style=\"width:400px;\" class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! style=\"background:silver;\"| Song\n! style=\"background:gray;\"| Artist\n|-\n| \"Love Kills\" (Title Track) || [[Joe Strummer]]\n|-\n| \"[[Haunted (Pogues song)|Haunted]]\" || [[The Pogues]]\n|-\n| \"Pleasure and Pain\" || [[Steve Jones (musician)|Steve Jones]]  \n|-\n| \"Chinese Choppers\" || [[Pray for Rain (band)|Pray for Rain]]\n|-\n| \"Love Kills\" || [[Circle Jerks]]\n|-\n| \"Off the Boat\" || Pray for Rain  \n|-\n| \"Dum Dum Club\" || Joe Strummer \n|-\n| \"Burning Room\" || Pray for Rain \n|-\n| \"She Never Took No for an Answer\" || [[John Cale]]  \n|-\n| \"Junk\" || The Pogues\n|-\n| \"I Wanna Be Your Dog\" || [[Gary Oldman]]\n|-\n| \"My Way\" || Gary Oldman\n|-\n| \"Taxi to Heaven\" || Pray for Rain\n|}\n\n==Home media==\n''Sid and Nancy'' was first released on DVD by [[The Criterion Collection]] in the late 1990s; this version has since gone out of print.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.slantmagazine.com/house/article/the-criterion-collection-20-sid-nancy|work=Slant Magazine|title=Alex Cox's Sid & Nancy on Criterion|author=Wissot, Lauren|date=2 February 2009|access-date=12 May 2017}}</ref> [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] (the video distributor of the catalog of Embassy Pictures, which released the film on VHS) released the film on DVD in 2000.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/1417/sid-and-nancy/|work=DVD Talk|title=Sid and Nancy|author=Jawetz, Gil|date=19 December 2000|access-date=15 May 2017}}</ref> The Criterion Collection released the film on [[Blu-ray]] and DVD on 24 August 2017.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.criterion.com/films/535-sid-nancy|work=The Criterion Collection|title=Sid & Nancy (1986) | access-date=16 May 2017}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==Sources==\n*{{cite book | last = Cox | first = Alex | title = X Films: True Confessions of a Radical Filmmaker | publisher = [[Soft Skull Press]] | year = 2008 | isbn = 978-1-59376-193-6 }}\n\n==External links==\n{{wikiquote}}\n* {{IMDb title|0091954}}\n* {{Amg movie|44582}}\n* {{tcmdb title|id=90071}}\n* {{mojo title|sidandnancy}}\n* {{rotten-tomatoes|sid_and_nancy}}\n* [https://www.criterion.com/current/posts/28-sid-nancy ''Sid & Nancy''] an essay by Jon Savage at the [[Criterion Collection]]\n\n{{Sex Pistols}}\n{{Alex Cox}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Sid And Nancy}}\n[[Category:1986 films]]\n[[Category:1980s English-language films]]\n[[Category:1980s biographical drama films]]\n[[Category:1980s musical drama films]]\n[[Category:British biographical drama films]]\n[[Category:British independent films]]\n[[Category:British musical drama films]]\n[[Category:Biographical films about musicians]]\n[[Category:Films about heroin addiction]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Alex Cox]]\n[[Category:Films set in London]]\n[[Category:Films set in New York (state)]]\n[[Category:Films set in the 1970s]]\n[[Category:Films shot in California]]\n[[Category:Films shot in London]]\n[[Category:Films shot in New Jersey]]\n[[Category:Films about mental health]]\n[[Category:Drama films based on actual events]]\n[[Category:Musical films based on actual events]]\n[[Category:Punk films]]\n[[Category:Cultural depictions of the Sex Pistols]]\n[[Category:Films produced by Eric Fellner]]\n[[Category:The Samuel Goldwyn Company films]]\n[[Category:1986 drama films]]\n[[Category:1980s British films]]"}]}}}}
