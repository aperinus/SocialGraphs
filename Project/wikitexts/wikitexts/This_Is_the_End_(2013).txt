Please keep rewrites within this range! (It's a summary, not a competition to see who can remember the most detail.) --->\n[[Jay Baruchel]] arrives in [[Los Angeles]] to visit an old friend and fellow Canadian actor [[Seth Rogen]], who invites him to a housewarming party hosted by [[James Franco]]. There, Jay is uncomfortable at the crowded party, so Seth accompanies him to a [[convenience store]] for [[cigarette]]s. When [[rapture|beams of blue light come down and suck numerous people into the sky]], Seth and Jay flee back to James' house and find the party unharmed. An [[earthquake]] strikes, and the crowd rushes outside, witnessing a [[sinkhole]] opening up in James' yard. Several celebrities and party guests are killed as Seth, Jay, James, [[Jonah Hill]] and [[Craig Robinson (actor)|Craig Robinson]] run back inside the house, where Jay tells the remaining partygoers that the earthquake has destroyed most of Los Angeles. They take inventory of their supplies, set up a ration system, board up the house, and await help.\n\nThe next morning, [[Danny McBride]], who crashed the party and fell asleep, wakes up first and wastes much of the group's food and water due to his ignorance of the crisis. He disbelieves what the others tell him of the previous night's events until an unseen creature decapitates a man outside. Tensions rise due to various conflicts, including Jay and Seth's growing estrangement and the others' skepticism of Jay's belief that the disaster might be the [[Apocalypse]] predicted in the ''[[Book of Revelation]]''. [[Emma Watson]] makes her way back to James' house. However, she misinterprets an overheard conversation and, believing the group intends to rape her, flees with their remaining water.\n\nCraig goes for water stored in James' cellar but finds the doors locked. Outside he encounters an unknown being, causing him to believe Jay's theory. Jay and Seth dig through the floor and find water, but Danny wastes most of it out of spite, and the others kick him out of the house. Before leaving, Danny reveals that Jay was in town two months prior but stayed at a [[hotel]] instead of with Seth because of their strained friendship. Jonah annoys Jay, who then punches him in the face. That night, Jonah prays for Jay to die and is [[Demonic possession|possessed]] by a [[demon]]. While Craig and Jay venture to a neighbor's house for to scavenge for supplies, the possessed Jonah attacks Seth and James. Jay and Craig return and help subdue Jonah, tying him to a bed. During an [[exorcism]] attempt, Jay and Seth fight and knock over a candle, starting a fire that engulfs Jonah and the house and forces the others outside.\n\nJames suggests driving to his home in [[Malibu, California|Malibu]], but finds his car guarded by a demon. Craig volunteers to sacrifice himself and is raptured into [[Heaven]] when the plan succeeds; the others realize they can save themselves by performing a selfless act. On the way to Malibu, the three encounter cannibals led by Danny and his sex slave, [[Channing Tatum]]. When James volunteers to sacrifice himself, a blue beam begins to pull him to Heaven, but when he taunts and insults Danny, the beam vanishes, and Danny and the other cannibals eat James alive while Seth and Jay escape and encounter [[Satan]]. Jay apologizes to Seth for his wrongdoings while Satan attempts to eat them. A beam strikes Jay, and he begins to ascend while Seth does not. Jay grabs Seth's hand, but his presence prevents them from ascending into Heaven; Seth forces Jay to leave him behind, after which another beam appears around Seth, inadvertently skewering Satan and castrating him.\n\nThe pair arrive in Heaven and are reunited with Craig, who tells them that any wish comes true. After Jay wishes for the [[Backstreet Boys]], the band performs \"[[Everybody (Backstreet's Back)]]\" as everyone in Heaven dances.\n\n==Cast==\nMost of the film's cast portray fictional and exaggerated versions of themselves:<ref>{{cite web|first=Adam|last=Chitwood|title=First Red-Band Clip and Poster for Seth Rogen's THIS IS THE END Starring Jay Baruchel, James Franco, Danny McBride, Jonah Hill, and Many More|url=http://collider.com/this-is-the-end-red-band-trailer/219114/|publisher=Collider.com|date=December 20, 2012|access-date=December 20, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121230234623/http://collider.com/this-is-the-end-red-band-trailer/219114|archive-date=December 30, 2012|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref> {{cast listing|\n* [[James Franco]]\n* [[Jonah Hill]]\n* [[Seth Rogen]]\n* [[Jay Baruchel]]\n* [[Danny McBride]]\n* [[Craig Robinson (actor)|Craig Robinson]]\n* [[Michael Cera]]\n* [[Emma Watson]]\n* [[Mindy Kaling]]\n* [[David Krumholtz]]\n* [[Christopher Mintz-Plasse]]\n* [[Rihanna]]\n* [[Martin Starr]]\n* [[Paul Rudd]]\n* [[Channing Tatum]]\n* [[Kevin Hart]]\n* [[Aziz Ansari]]\n* [[Backstreet Boys]]\n** [[Nick Carter (musician)|Nick Carter]]\n** [[Howie Dorough]]\n** [[Brian Littrell]]\n** [[AJ McLean]]\n** [[Kevin Richardson (musician)|Kevin Richardson]]\n* [[Evan Goldberg]] (uncredited)\n* [[Jason Segel]] (uncredited)\n}}\nAdditionally, [[Brian Huskey]] portrays a survivor who attempts to enter Franco's home and Ricky Mabe appears as one of McBride's cannibals, dressed as [[Santa Claus]].<ref name=\"Feature\">{{cite AV media |people=[[Seth Rogen|Rogen, Seth]] and [[Evan Goldberg]] (directors) |year=2013 |title=This Is the End |medium=Motion picture |publisher = [[Sony Pictures Releasing]]}}</ref> [[Jason Trost]] makes an uncredited appearance as JTRO, a character he previously portrayed in ''[[The FP]]'' (2011).<ref>{{cite news |last=Francisco |first=Eric |title=Indie Director Jason Trost Wants His Rematch in 'The FP' Sequel |url=https://www.inverse.com/article/10997-indie-director-jason-trost-wants-his-rematch-in-the-fp-sequel |work=[[Inverse (website)|Inverse]] |date=February 4, 2016 |access-date=November 2, 2019}}</ref> [[Carol Sutton (actress)|Carol Sutton]] also appears as a gas station cashier in an early scene.
