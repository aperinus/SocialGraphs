The film earned [[US$]]28,881,266 at the box office, making it the fourth-highest-grossing film starring Pauly Shore (behind ''[[Encino Man]]'', ''[[Son in Law]]'' and ''[[A Goofy Movie]]'').\n\n==Plot==\n[[Slacker]]s Bones Conway ([[Pauly Shore]]) and Jack Kaufman ([[Andy Dick]]) work at \"Crazy Boys\" discount electronics store in [[Glendale, California]]. While goofing off on the job, both aspire to open their own electronics store in the future. Both are fired though after destroying a rack of television sets.\n\nLooking to score some quick start-up money for their store and believing that the commitment will be minimal (they are easily lured by the recruiting slogan \"[[One weekend a month, two weeks a year]]\"), the two join the [[United States Army Reserves]]. Bones chooses [[water purification]] for their field since his brother was an experienced [[Swimming pool sanitation|pool man]] and the field appeared to be devoid of [[combat]]. After surviving [[United States Army Basic Training|basic training]], they attend water purification training, meeting up with Christine Jones ([[Lori Petty]]), a female recruit longing for [[infantry]], and skittish dental student Fred Ostroff ([[David Alan Grier]]). Adopting the nickname of \"waterboys\", the group then returns to Glendale.\n\nUnbeknownst to Bones and Jack, [[Libya]] has been planning an invasion of [[Chad]], and they are consequently called up for service overseas. They first try to get a [[military discharge]] by pretending to be [[Sexual orientation and military service|homosexuals]], but they fail.\n\nUpon arriving in Chad, the four do not get along well with the full-time soldiers, particularly [[Special Forces (United States Army)|Special Forces]] [[Staff Sergeant#United States|Staff Sergeant]] Stern ([[Esai Morales]]). On a routine mission to resupply a [[Front line|forward]] base, their convoy is ambushed by a Libyan [[commando]] squad. The misfit reserves are thought to have been [[Killed in action|killed in action (KIA)]] and are left to fend for themselves. After a few days lost in the desert, they are captured by the Libyan forces and spend a night in a Libyan [[Prisoner-of-war camp|POW camp]]. There the reservists meet up with Staff Sergeant Stern who has been shot and captured in an ambush. He briefs them on his failed mission to rendezvous with two [[HALO jump|HALOed]] [[Desert Patrol Vehicle|Fast Attack vehicles]] and destroy [[Scud|mobile Scud launchers]] carrying missiles armed with [[Chemical warfare|chemical warheads]] aimed at American bases in the region.\n\nDuring an [[airstrike]], the four reservists and Stern escape and find the Fast Attack vehicles. They make contact with the American headquarters and are ordered to finish the Special Forces' mission. After locating the missiles, they have a difficult time holding off a battalion of Libyans while [[Laser guidance|painting]] the missiles with a [[laser]] for an incoming airstrike. The airstrike goes off-target, forcing the reservists to destroy the missiles themselves. Bones grabs an [[AT4]] [[anti-tank]] [[Shoulder-launched missile weapon|rocket launcher]] and destroys the Scud launcher base in one hit, but not before accidentally firing one rocket backwards, forcing the group to use the last rocket they have.\n\nThe \"waterboys\" return home as heroes. At the end of the film, they open up their electronics shop next to an Army recruiting station &mdash; where two men like themselves are looking skeptical about joining the reserves.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Pauly Shore]] as Private First Class Bones Conway\n* [[Lori Petty]] as Private Christine Jones\n* [[David Alan Grier]] as Private Fred Ostroff\n* [[Andy Dick]] as Private Jack Kaufman\n* [[Esai Morales]] as Staff Sergeant Stern\n* [[Lynn Whitfield]] as Drill Sergeant Ladd\n* [[Fabiana Udenio]] as Gabriella\n* [[Art LaFleur]] as First Sergeant Brandon T.
