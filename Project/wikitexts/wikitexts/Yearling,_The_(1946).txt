The screenplay by [[Paul Osborn]] and [[John Lee Mahin]] (uncredited) was adapted from [[Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings]]'s 1938 [[The Yearling|novel of the same name]]. The film stars [[Gregory Peck]], [[Jane Wyman]], [[Claude Jarman Jr.]], [[Chill Wills]], and [[Forrest Tucker]].\n\nThe story is about a young boy who adopts a trouble-making young deer. The story was later adapted as the 1994 TV film ''[[The Yearling (1994 film)|The Yearling]]'' starring [[Peter Strauss]] and [[Jean Smart]].<ref>{{IMDb title|0111792}}</ref>\n\n== Plot ==\nEzra \"Penny\" Baxter, once a [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] soldier, and his wife Ora, are pioneer farmers near [[Lake George (Florida)|Lake George, Florida]] in 1878. Their son, Jody, a boy in his pre-teen years, is their only surviving child. Jody has a wonderful relationship with his warm and loving father. Ora, however, is still haunted by the deaths of the other children of the family she had lost over the years. She is very sombre and is afraid that Jody will end up dying if she shows her parental love to him. Jody finds her somewhat unloving and unreasonable.\n\nWith all of his siblings dead and buried, Jody longs for a pet to play with and care for. Penny is sympathetic and understanding, but Ora is disgusted and believes that a pet is nothing but trouble. One morning, Jody and his parents discover that their old enemy, a bear named Old Slewfoot, has returned and killed a calf and young pig from among their stock. They set out after the bear, accompanied by Penny's dogs Perk, Rip, and Julia. They catch up with the bear, but Old Slewfoot is able to escape after Perk flees from the bear fight in terror, Penny's gun backfires, and Julia is badly injured. Upset over his best hunting dog injured from the fight, his gun useless, and his new dog Perk useless as a hunting dog, Penny decides to trade in Perk for a new gun with his neighbors, the Forresters. Jody becomes acquainted with Fodderwing, who is the youngest of the Forresters and keeps a menagerie of pets, and the two become fast friends. Lem Forrester trades Penny a new shotgun in exchange for the mongrel Perk.\n\nOne day, as Penny and Jody are tracking down their missing hogs that had been stolen by the Forresters, a [[rattlesnake]] bites Penny before he kills it with his new gun. Penny kills a [[deer|doe]] and uses its liver to draw out the [[Snake venom|venom]]. Jody asks to adopt the doe's orphaned [[deer|fawn]]. Penny permits it but warns Jody that the fawn will have to be set free when it grows up.\n\nWhen Jody goes to ask his only friend, Fodderwing, to name the fawn, Jody finds out that Fodderwing has just died. However, Buck Forrester tells Jody that Fodderwing had said that if he had a fawn he would name him Flag because of its white tail. Jody and his family attend Fodderwing's funeral, and at a generous request from the Forresters, Penny offers a eulogy about Fodderwing's kindness and wisdom with the wild animals and says that in the House of the Lord Fodderwing will be healed of his crippled body, walking around as easily as anyone else.\n\nAs the months pass, Jody and Flag are inseparable. One year later (now a \"yearling\"), Flag has grown up and become a nuisance to the household and farm; he eats newly-grown corn, destroys fences, and tramples on tobacco crops. After Penny is injured while trying to clear another field to make up for lost crops, Penny tells Jody that he and his mother have agreed that for Jody to keep Flag he must replant corn and build the fence around the field higher. Jody works hard and even receives help from Ora with the fence, but during the night, Flag manages to jump the new fence and destroys the new corn crop. Penny orders Jody to take the deer out into the woods and shoot it. Jody takes Flag out but does not have the heart to kill it.  He orders the deer to go away and never return, but Flag comes back to their property and again devours the crop. Ora (whom Jody believes had always hated his pet) shoots Flag with a [[double-barreled shotgun]], discharging one of the barrels but only wounding the deer. Penny orders Jody to put the deer out of its \"torment\". Rather than let his pet deer suffer an agonizing death, he follows his father's orders and kills Flag with the remaining shell.\n\nThe loss of Jody's beloved pet deer proves too much for him to handle: overwhelmed with anger and despair, he runs away from home. Three days later, he is rescued, unconscious and adrift on the river in a canoe, by a friendly boat captain and returns home. He and Penny quickly reconcile, but Ora is still out searching for him. Just before Jody goes to bed, Ora returns and sees that he is back. She becomes filled with happiness and emotion, knowing that her huge fear of losing her last child is now over. She happily runs into Jody's room and showers him with more affection than she has before. She is no longer afraid to show her maternal love to him.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/2523/The-Yearling/full-synopsis.html |title=The Yearling (1947) \u2013 Full Synopsis |publisher=TCM.com |access-date=December 18, 2012}}</ref>\n[[File:Theyearlingtrailentrance2006.jpg|right|thumb|Trailhead of The Yearling Trail]]\n\n== Cast ==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Gregory Peck]] as Ezra \"Penny\" Baxter\n* [[Jane Wyman]] as Ora Baxter\n* [[Claude Jarman Jr.]] as Jody\n* [[Chill Wills]] as Buck Forrester\n* [[Clem Bevans]] as Pa Forrester\n* [[Margaret Wycherly]] as Ma Forrester\n* [[Henry Travers]] as Mr. Boyles\n* [[Forrest Tucker]] as Lem Forrester\n* Donn Gift as Fodderwing Forrester\n* [[Arthur Hohl]] as Arch Forrester (uncredited)\n* [[June Lockhart]] as Twink, Oliver's Bride (uncredited)\n* [[George Mann (vaudeville performer)|George Mann]] as Pack Forrester (uncredited)\n* [[Houseley Stevenson]] as Mr. Ranger (uncredited)\n* [[Dan White (actor)|Dan White]] as Millwheel Forrester (uncredited)\n* Matt Willis as Gabby Forrester (uncredited)\n* Chick York as Doc Wilson (uncredited)\n* [[Jeff York]] as Oliver Hutto (uncredited)\n}}\n\n== Production ==\n[[File:Deer near Forrester Place farm (3586119972).jpg|thumb|Image from the pre-production and location scouting of MGM]]\n''The Yearling'' was filmed on location in the [[Juniper Prairie Wilderness]] in the [[Ocala National Forest]] in [[Florida]]. A hiking trail in the area, \"The Yearling Trail\", is named after the story, and gives access to sites where the family lived whose stories inspired the novel.\n\n[[MGM]] originally began production on ''The Yearling'' in 1941, with [[Spencer Tracy]] set to star as the patriarch, and with [[Victor Fleming]] chosen to direct. The studio also hired [[Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings]], the author of the novel ''[[The Yearling]]'', as a consultant and location scout.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2011/07/21/138561573/on-location-the-central-florida-of-the-yearling|title=On Location: The Central Florida Of 'The Yearling'|website=NPR.org|language=en|access-date=February 15, 2019}}</ref> Rawlings marked a forest service map with locations for filming, specifically referencing the clearing she named \"Baxter's Island.\" MGM moved to the filming location, renovated the cabin, and built surrounding buildings to create a town for a set. Once the actors arrived on location, a combination of the bugs, heat, and lack of enthusiasm for the plot made the actors leave.<ref name=\":0\" /> This led to the film being shelved after only three weeks of location shooting in Florida. (According to biographer Millicent Bell, famed novelist John P. Marquand was visiting MGM in 1941 and asked to sit in on a \"Yearling\" production meeting. He was amused to find that he was the only person in the meeting who had read the book.)\n\nProduction was resumed in 1945, after [[Clarence Brown]] was hired as the new director.<ref name=\":0\" /> Brown cast [[Gregory Peck]] to play Pa, [[Jane Wyman]] to play Ma, and after a long search, cast [[Claude Jarman Jr.]] to play Jody. Due to Brown's drive for perfection, the average take number for scenes was between 20\u201321. He also got real hunting dogs to film the bear fight scene after deciding the original city dogs were not good enough.<ref name=\":0\" /> Peck received the second of his five [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] nominations for ''The Yearling'', his fifth film.\n\n== Music ==\n[[Herbert Stothart]] made arrangements of [[Frederick Delius]]'s music, particularly ''Appalachia: Variations on an Old Slave Song'', for the film.<ref>[http://www.musicweb-international.com/classrev/2002/Jan02/Delius_North_Beecham.htm#ixzz4rN9BznfA Music Web International].
