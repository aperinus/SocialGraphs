The film stars [[Paul Rudd]] as a friendless man looking for a [[best man]] for his upcoming [[marriage in the United States|wedding]]. However, his new best friend ([[Jason Segel]]) is straining his [[Interpersonal relationship|relationship]] with his bride ([[Rashida Jones]]).\n\nThe film was released theatrically in the United States on March 20, 2009, to mostly positive reviews.<ref>{{cite web|last=Vilkomerson|first=Sara|date=March 10, 2009|url=http://observer.com/2009/03/a-romantic-comedy-about-two-straight-men-john-hamburgs-ii-love-you-mani-might-be-the-first-dude-flick-with-a-heart/|title= A Romantic Comedy About Two Straight Men: John Hamburg's I Love You, Man Might Be the First Dude Flick With a Heart|work=[[The New York Observer]]|access-date=March 20, 2018}}</ref> The film grossed $92 million on a $40 million budget. It marked the third collaboration between Segel and Rudd, after ''[[Knocked Up]]'' (2007) and ''[[Forgetting Sarah Marshall]]'' (2008).\n\n==Plot==\nPeter Klaven, a [[Los Angeles]] [[real estate]] agent, proposes to his girlfriend Zooey Rice, and she accepts. He doesn't have any close male friends to share the news with, only family and mainly female acquaintances. After overhearing her friends' concern over his lack of guy friends, Peter decides he needs to find some to have a [[Groomsman#Best man|best man]] for the wedding.\n\nPeter turns to his [[homosexuality|gay]] younger brother, Robbie, for advice on meeting men. He makes a series of overtures toward various men, including Barry, the persistently hot-headed husband of Zooey's friend Denise. Barry doesn't like Peter too much\u2014a problem which only escalates when Peter, after winning a [[beer]]-drinking contest, inadvertently projectile-vomits on Barry.\n\nFeeling rejected, Peter is about to give up when, at an open house at [[Lou Ferrigno]]'s mansion which he is trying to sell, he meets Sydney Fife, an investor who is attending the show to pick up divorced women and take advantage of the free food. They quickly become friends, bonding over their mutual adoration of the [[progressive rock]] band [[Rush (band)|Rush]]. Peter introduces Sydney to Zooey at their engagement party, but unfortunately a nervous Sydney makes a very awkward toast which includes veiled encouragement for Zooey to perform [[fellatio|oral sex]] on Peter more often.\n\nThe next night, Peter attends a Rush concert with Sydney, on the condition that he bring Zooey. During the concert, she feels ignored by them. The next day, while shopping for tuxedos, Sydney asks Peter why he is marrying Zooey, and also asks for an $8,000 loan. After some thought, Peter decides to lend Sydney the money, and later asks him to be his best man. Zooey, meanwhile, has become suspicious of Sydney. Peter tells her that he lent Sydney money and asks her if she knows why they are getting married, since he had no answer to Sydney's question (not aware the question was supposed to stay between him and Sydney). Hurt and angry, Zooey leaves.\n\nPeter goes to work the next morning, discovering Sydney has used the $8,000 loan to purchase several ridiculous [[billboard|billboard advertisements]] promoting Peter's real estate business (with photos of Peter he had taken). Still upset over his fight with Zooey, he confronts Sydney and ends their friendship. Peter then patches things up with Zooey, explaining that although he is nervous, he is ready to get married. As they prepare for the wedding, Sydney finds himself alone and desperate to hang with someone.\n\nAt work, Peter discovers that Sydney's billboard advertising campaign was successful. He won back the right to the lucrative Ferrigno listing and many others left messages, wanting him to sell their houses. Feeling encouraged, Peter finally stands up to his insufferable colleague, Tevin Downey, who had been badgering Peter for half the selling rights to the Ferrigno property. When he makes one final attempt to get a piece of it, Peter slaps him, telling him to back off.\n\nPeter feels bad about fighting with Sydney but does not re-invite him to the wedding. Instead, he assembles an array of random groomsmen that includes Robbie, father Oswald, and Ferrigno. Before the wedding, Zooey sees Peter looking forlorn, clearly missing Sydney. She calls and invites Sydney, who is, unbeknownst to them, already en route to the wedding. \n\nJust before the vows are to be taken, Sydney makes a dramatic entrance via [[Vespa]]. He reminds Peter and Zooey that he is, in fact, a successful investor and returns the money he borrowed from Peter, announcing the billboards were their wedding present. Peter and Zooey declare their love to each other, Sydney assumes the role of best man, and the wedding continues.\n\nAs the credits roll, we see the wedding reception, where Peter and Sydney join the hired band (played by [[OK Go]]) in a rendition of the Rush song \"[[Limelight (Rush song)|Limelight]]\" pulling Zooey on stage to join them. As the song ends, Sydney attempts to toast the newlyweds and Peter runs to frantically stop him as the screen cuts out (remembering Sydney's ill-advised toast at the engagement dinner).\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:IloveyoumanTXpremiereMarch09.jpg|thumb|right|[[Jon Favreau]], [[Jaime Pressly]], [[Jason Segel]], [[John Hamburg]], Larry Levin, [[Rashida Jones]], and [[Paul Rudd]] at the [[premiere]] in [[Austin, Texas]] in March 2009.]]\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Paul Rudd]] as Peter Klaven\n* [[Jason Segel]] as Sydney Fife\n* [[Rashida Jones]] as Zooey Rice\n* [[Andy Samberg]] as Robbie Klaven\n* [[Josh Cooke]] as Alan, Robbie's boyfriend\n* [[J.
