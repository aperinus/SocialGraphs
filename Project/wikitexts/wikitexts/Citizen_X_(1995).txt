The film is based upon the true story of [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] serial killer [[Andrei Chikatilo]], who was convicted in 1992 of the murder of 52 women and children committed between 1978 and 1990. It stars [[Stephen Rea]], [[Donald Sutherland]], and [[Max Von Sydow]].\n\nThe film is based on Robert Cullen's non-fiction book ''[[The Killer Department]]'', published in 1993.\n\n==Plot==\nA body is discovered on a [[collective farming|collective farm]] during harvesting in 1982. A subsequent search of adjacent woods, authorized by newly installed [[forensic science|forensic]] specialist, Viktor Burakov, turns up seven more bodies in varying stages of decomposition. The film tells the story of the subsequent eight-year hunt by Burakov for the serial killer responsible for the mutilation and murder of 53 people, 52 of them below the age of 35. Burakov is promoted to detective and eventually aided, covertly at first, by Col. Mikhail Fetisov, his commanding officer and the shrewd head of the provincial committee for crime, and, much later, by Alexandr Bukhanovsky, a psychiatrist with a particular interest in what he calls \"abnormal psychology\".\n\nAs well as taking on the form of a crime thriller, the movie depicts Soviet [[propaganda]] and [[bureaucracy]] that contributed to the failure of [[law enforcement]] agencies to capture the killer, [[Andrei Chikatilo]], for almost a decade. Chikatilo's crimes were not reported publicly for years. Local politicians were fearful such revelations would have a negative impact on the USSR's image, since serial killers were associated with \"[[Decadence|decadent]], [[Western world|Western]]\" moral corruption.\n\nChikatilo first came under scrutiny early in the search when he was spotted at a station and found holding a satchel bag containing a knife. He was promptly arrested. Unfortunately, he was shielded from investigation and released due to his membership in the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist Party]]. Additionally, the Soviet crime labs erroneously reported that his [[blood type]] did not match that found at the murders. All this changed under the political reforms of ''[[glasnost]]'' and ''[[Perestroika]]'', and the search for the killer began to make progress.\n\nWith the passage of time and easing of political restrictions, Burakov devises a plan to blanket almost all the railroad stations, where the serial killer preys upon the young and unsuspecting, with conspicuous uniformed men to discourage the killer. Three small stations, however, are left unattended, except for undercover agents. Chikatilo is eventually discovered and identified through the diligence of a local, plainclothes soldier.\n\nArrested, Andrei Chikatilo is interrogated for seven consecutive days by Gorbunov, a Soviet hardliner who insists that he be the one to extract a confession. Chikatilo will not yield and, under pressure from Fetisov and Burakov, Gorbunov agrees to another approach. Psychiatrist Bukhanovsky is introduced into the interview room. He recites from his lengthy analysis and speculation, made three years earlier, of the personality and tendencies of this sexually frustrated killer, whom he had entitled \"Citizen X\". Bukhanovsky eventually strikes a nerve, and a weeping Chikatilo finally admits his guilt and answers specific questions about the details of some murders. Afterwards, Chikatilo leads law enforcement officials to the crime scenes and three additional undetected graves.\n\nHeld in a metal cage during his trial, a wild-eyed Chikatilo is convicted and sentenced to death. The film concludes with Chikatilo being led to a nameless prison chamber and shows him staring in shock at a central drain in the room's floor as a uniformed soldier delivers a pistol shot to the back of the killer's head.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Stephen Rea]] as Lieutenant (later Colonel) Viktor Burakov\n* [[Donald Sutherland]] as Colonel (later General) Mikhail Fetisov\n* [[Jeffrey DeMunn]] as [[Andrei Chikatilo]]\n* [[Max von Sydow]] as Dr. Alexandr Bukhanovsky\n* [[Joss Ackland]] as Bondarchuk\n* [[John Wood (English actor)|John Wood]] as Gorbunov\n* [[Ion Caramitru]] as Tatevsky\n* [[Imelda Staunton]] as Ms. Burakova\n\n==Production==\n===Locations===\nThe film was shot in [[Hungary]].

Several other scenes were shot in the G\u00f6d\u00f6ll\u0151 Railway Station.\n\n===Director===\nThe film was directed by [[Chris Gerolmo]], who additionally wrote the screenplay (adapted from Robert Cullen's 1993 non-fiction book ''[[The Killer Department]]'') in addition to playing a minor role in the film as a militiaman.\n\n===Soundtrack===\nThe score for ''Citizen X'' was composed and conducted by [[Randy Edelman]].
