The film is highly regarded, ranking #2 in the [[Hong Kong Film Awards#Best 100 Chinese Motion Pictures|Best 100 Chinese Motion Pictures]]. Its success led to a sequel, ''[[A Better Tomorrow II]]'', also directed by Woo, and ''[[A Better Tomorrow 3|A Better Tomorrow 3: Love & Death in Saigon]]'', a [[prequel]] directed by [[Tsui Hark]]. It has been remade several times.\n\nThe film was Chow Yun-fat's breakout role and launched him as one of the top superstars in the Hong Kong film industry.

Ho is a respected member of the organization, entrusted with the most important transactions. Mark Lee<ref name=\"A better 20132\">{{cite web |title=A Better Tomorrow |url=http://www.asia.si.edu/events/films.asp?trumbaEmbed=view%3devent%26eventid%3d105496397 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131126214729/http://www.asia.si.edu/events/films.asp?trumbaEmbed=view%3devent%26eventid%3d105496397 |archive-date=26 November 2013 |access-date=2 July 2013 |publisher=Freer Gallery |df=dmy-all}}</ref> is his best friend, bodyguard, and business partner. The prologue follows a day in the life of Ho and Mark as they watch a fresh batch of counterfeit notes being printed and meet with foreign clients to trade their product for counterfeit Chinese bank notes.\n\nMeanwhile, Ho's younger brother, Kit, has just graduated high school and is currently training to join the police. Ho hides his criminal life from his brother and encourages Kit's career choice, while their ailing father pleads for Ho to leave his life of crime. Ho agrees, deciding that he will retire from the triad after his next deal in [[Taiwan]]. Shing, a low ranking triad, joins Ho after he agrees to mentor him. However, they are ambushed by the Taiwanese triads, leading to a shootout in which Ho and Shing flee into a sewage tunnel entrance, pursued by local law enforcement. Ho tells Shing to run, and surrenders to the police in order to buy time for him to escape, leading to a three year prison sentence.\n\nAfter learning of the deal, the triads attempt to kidnap Ho's father as leverage to ensure Ho's silence in prison; Ho's father is fatally stabbed before Kit and his girlfriend Jackie manage to subdue the attacker. With his dying breath, he pleads Kit to forgive his brother for his criminal actions, and an enraged Kit blames Ho for their father's death. Later, Mark travels to Taiwan to get answers from the Taiwanese triad. He visits a restaurant where the gangster who planned the ambush is dining, and kills him following a shootout with his bodyguards. However, Mark's leg is injured in the process, leaving him crippled and requiring a leg brace.\n\nAfter Ho is released from prison, he is approached by a policeman, who offers to take him back to triad headquarters so he can rejoin his old organization. Ho, determined to start a new life, declines the offer and instead begins working for a taxi company run by another ex-con named Ken. During one of his shifts, Ho encounters Mark, and he discovers that Mark has become bitter after Shing stripped him of his position in the triad and cast him aside in his rise to power. When they reunite, Mark urges Ho to confront Shing, but Ho refuses.\n\nHo then seeks out Kit, now a police officer, in hopes of reconciling. However, he is harshly rebuffed by Kit, who still blames Ho for their father's death and because his relation to Ho is preventing him from advancing his career. In an effort to prove himself and further distance himself from his brother, Kit becomes obsessed with bringing down Shing, despite Ho's warnings.\n\nShing, hearing of Ho's return to Hong Kong, tries to persuade him to return and help expand their triad into [[drug trafficking]], but Ho refuses. Shing then has his men attack the taxi company, severely beat Mark, and lure Kit into a trap that leaves him critically wounded. Though Ho is still hesitant to take action, Mark is eventually able to persuade Ho to retaliate.\n\nMark steals a [[Magnetic tape data storage|computer tape]] containing printing plate data from the counterfeiting business and they then discover that it was Shing who set up the ambush three years prior. Meanwhile, Shing sets up triad leader Yie and shoots him dead; the witnesses are told to lie to the police that Ho was the killer. Ho and Mark then use the tape to blackmail Shing in exchange for money and an escape boat. Ho ensures that the tape is passed to Kit as proof of Shing's crimes. Using Shing as a hostage, Ho and Mark take the money to a pier, where Shing's men await. There, Ho implores Mark to escape by himself in the boat, and Mark hesitantly agrees.\n\nAfter Mark's departure, Kit arrives on the scene intending to arrest Shing, but ends up being taken hostage. A deal is made to exchange Shing for Kit, but the negotiation spirals into first a standoff and eventually a shootout. Ho and Kit work together against Shing's men, and are overwhelmed. Mark, hearing the sounds of gunfire, quickly returns to the scene. Ho, Kit and Mark kill several of Shing's henchmen, but also suffer injuries in the process. During a lull in the gunfight, Ho attempts to make peace with Kit but is rebuffed again. Mark then reprimands Kit, telling him that Ho's present actions have atoned for the past. As the three are distracted however, Mark is fatally shot in the back by Shing.\n\nAs the police approach, Shing mocks Ho and Kit, proclaiming that once he enters police custody, his money and power will ensure his swift release. Kit then hands Ho his gun, allowing him to fatally shoot Shing. As Kit watches Shing's body fall to the ground, Ho suddenly handcuffs himself to Kit. The two brothers then begin walking together towards the gathered crowd of police.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Ti Lung]] as Sung Tse Ho\n* [[Leslie Cheung]] as Sung Tse Kit\n* [[Chow Yun-fat]] as Mark Lee, nicknamed \"Mark Gor\" (Brother Mark)\n* [[Emily Chu]] as Jackie, Kit's girlfriend\n* [[Waise Lee]] as Shing Dan\n* [[Shing Fui-On]] as Dao-Yi, Shing's right-hand man\n* [[Kenneth Tsang]] as Ken, the owner of the cab company Ho joins\n* [[Tien Feng]] as Mr. Sung, the father of Ho and Kit\n* [[John Woo]] as Inspector Wu, a Taiwanese police official\n* Sek Yin-Tsi as Mr. Yiu\n* Wang Hsieh as Boss Wang\n* Chan Chi-Fai as 'Little' Wang\n* Hing-Yin Kam as Inspector Mok, Kit's superior\n* Pierre Tremblay as Interpol officer\n* [[Tsui Hark]] as a music judge\n* [[Stephen Chow]] as a Taiwanese triad\n}}\n== Production ==\nThe film is an uncredited remake of the 1967 [[Patrick Lung|Lung Kong]] film [[Story of a Discharged Prisoner|\u82f1\u96c4\u672c\u8272]] ([[pinyin]] ''Y\u012bngxi\u00f3ng b\u011bns\u00e8'') which has the same Chinese name but a different English name: ''[[Story of a Discharged Prisoner]]'', which is No. 39 on the [[Hong Kong Film Awards]] list of the Top 100 Chinese Films.<ref>{{Cite web|date=19 August 2014|title=\"Burn That Film!

This scene was recreated in Woo's ''[[Bullet in the Head]],'' which was originally scripted as a prequel to ''A Better Tomorrow,'' before being changed to a standalone film.\n\nThe English title is from the [[Lo Ta-yu]] song [[Tomorrow will be Better|Tomorrow will be Better (\u660e\u5929\u4f1a\u66f4\u597d/\u660e\u5929\u6703\u66f4\u597d)]], which is traditionally sung during [[New Year's Eve]], and is featured in the film.\n\n=== Filming locations ===\n[[File:HK YMT \u6cb9\u9ebb\u5730 Yau Ma Tei \u4e0a\u6d77\u8857 Shanghai Street near \u7518\u8085\u8857 Kansu Street \u773e\u574a\u8857 Public Square March 2020 SS2 02.jpg|thumb|right|The Tin Hau Temple Complex.]]\n[[File:Tai Kwun Police Headquarters Block 201806.jpg|thumb|right|The former Central Police station building.]]\n==== [[Hong Kong]] ====\n\n* Jackson Road, [[Central, Hong Kong|Central]]\n* [[Central Police Station (Hong Kong)|Central Police Station]], Central\n* [[Kennedy Town]], [[Central and Western District|Central and Western]]\n* [[Wan Chai]], [[Wan Chai District]]\n* Saint Paul Seminary, [[Causeway Bay]]\n* [[Sunning Plaza]], Causeway Bay\n* [[Kowloon Peak]]\n* [[To Kwa Wan]], [[Kowloon City District|Kowloon City]]\n* [[Stonecutters Island]]\n* [[Tin Hau Temple Complex, Yau Ma Tei|Tin Hau Temple Complex]], [[Kowloon Peninsula]]\n* [[Wo Hop Shek Public Cemetery]]\n\n==== [[Taiwan]] ====\n\n* [[Ximending]], [[Taipei]]\n* [[Renai Road]], Taipei\n* Taichung Correctional Center, [[Taichung]]\n\n== Music ==\n\n* During the nightclub scene, the song being played in the background (\u5e7e\u8a31\u98a8\u96e8, Gei2 heoi2 fung1 jyu5) is the Cantonese version of a classic South Korean song called 'Hee Na Ree'(\ud76c\ub098\ub9ac) sung originally by Goo Chang-mo([[:ko:\uad6c\ucc3d\ubaa8]]) in 1985.

A direct sequel, ''[[A Better Tomorrow 2]]'', was released the following year. [[John Woo]] returned to direct, as did most of the main cast, with Chow Yun-fat playing Mark's hitherto-unmentioned twin brother Ken. A prequel, ''[[A Better Tomorrow III: Love & Death in Saigon]]'', was released in 1989, with Chow returning to play Mark. Woo was not involved in the prequel, due to a falling-out with [[Tsui Hark]], so Hark directed the film himself. Woo's unproduced screenplay draft was later made as ''[[Bullet in the Head]]'' (1990).\n\nThe film has two official remakes. ''[[A Better Tomorrow (2010 film)|A Better Tomorrow]]'' (2010) was produced in South Korea, directed by [[Song Hae-sung]], with John Woo serving as executive producer. ''[[A Better Tomorrow 2018]]'' (2018) was produced in Mainland China, directed by [[Ding Sheng (filmmaker)|Ding Sheng]].\n\n==Cultural impact==\n* After the film, teenage boys in Hong Kong wore long [[Duster (clothing)|dusters]] in emulation of Chow's character even though the climate was sub-tropical. In fact, in colloquial Cantonese, [[Trench coats in popular culture|trench coats]] are called \"Mark Gor Lau\" (literally, Brother Mark's coat).\n* The [[Wu-Tang Clan]] has a song named after the film on their 1997 album ''[[Wu-Tang Forever]].''\n* The [[Wu-Tang Clan]] 20th anniversary album also shares the name [[A Better Tomorrow (album)|''A Better Tomorrow'']].\n*The [[anime]] series ''[[Cowboy Bebop]]'' has many references to the film series, including the last fight between [[Spike Spiegel|Spike]] and [[List of Cowboy Bebop characters#Vicious|Vicious]] in the episode [[List of Cowboy Bebop episodes|\"The Real Folk Blues (Part 2)\"]] which parallels the final shoot out in \"A Better Tomorrow 2\".\n*The character Mr. Chang from the ''[[Black Lagoon]]'' is closely patterned after Chow's character Mark in both visual design and characterisation. \n*Chow wore [[Alain Delon]] sunglasses in the movie. After the movie, Hong Kong was sold out of Alain Delon's sunglasses. Delon sent Chow a personal thank you note.\n* The 1994 [[Bollywood]] film ''[[Aatish: Feel the Fire]]'' (1994), directed by [[Sanjay Gupta (director)|Sanjay Gupta]], was an unofficial remake combining elements of both the Bollywood classic ''[[Deewaar]]'' (1975)<ref name=\"Chaudhuri245\">{{cite book|last=Chaudhuri|first=Diptakirti|title=Written by Salim-Javed: The Story of Hindi Cinema's Greatest Screenwriters|date=2015|publisher=[[Penguin Books]]|isbn=9789352140084|page=245|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Cri9CgAAQBAJ&pg=PT245|language=en}}</ref> and John Woo's ''A Better Tomorrow''.<ref>{{cite book|last=Peirse|first=Alison|title=Korean Horror Cinema|date=2013|publisher=[[Edinburgh University Press]]|isbn=9780748677658|page=190|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RkurBgAAQBAJ&pg=PA190|language=en}}</ref> The film starred [[Sanjay Dutt]], [[Atul Agnihotri]], [[Aditya Pancholi]] and [[Shakti Kapoor]].\n*The theme song was covered in 2016 by [[Louis Koo]] and [[Leo Ku]] in memoriam of Leslie Cheung.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{wikiquote}}\n* {{IMDb title|0092263}}\n* {{Amg movie|5168}}\n* {{Rotten-tomatoes|better_tomorrow}}\n\n{{A Better Tomorrow}}\n{{John Woo}}\n{{Tsui Hark}}\n{{Best Film HKFA}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Better Tomorrow, A}}\n[[Category:1986 films]]\n[[Category:1980s crime action films]]\n[[Category:1980s crime drama films]]\n[[Category:1980s buddy films]]\n[[Category:Hong Kong buddy films]]\n[[Category:Hong Kong crime action films]]\n[[Category:Hong Kong gangster films]]\n[[Category:Triad films]]\n[[Category:Hong Kong films]]\n[[Category:Gun fu films]]\n[[Category:Films about families]]\n[[Category:Films about brothers]]\n[[Category:Films about criminals]]\n[[Category:Films about friendship]]\n[[Category:Films set in Hong Kong]]\n[[Category:Films set in Taipei]]\n[[Category:Films directed by John Woo]]\n[[Category:A Better Tomorrow films]]\n[[Category:Cantonese-language films]]\n[[Category:Best Film HKFA]]\n[[Category:Hong Kong neo-noir films]]\n[[Category:1986 drama films]]\n[[Category:Hong Kong New Wave films]]\n[[Category:Hong Kong action drama films]]"}]}}}}
