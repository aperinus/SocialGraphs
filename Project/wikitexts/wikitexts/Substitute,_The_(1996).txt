After a botched covert operation in [[Cuba]] in which three men from his platoon were killed, he returns home to [[Miami]]. He surprises his girlfriend, Jane Hetzko, at her apartment; she welcomes him warmly. Hetzko is a schoolteacher at inner-city Columbus High School, an institution with a considerable gang problem.\n\nShe is particularly disliked by Juan Lacas, leader of the Kings of Destruction gang (KOD). While jogging one morning, Hetzko is attacked and has her leg broken. Hetzko and Shale believe this to be related to the KOD, which prompts the latter to go undercover as an [[Ivy League]]-educated, government-affiliated substitute teacher for his girlfriend's class.\n\nShale arrives at Columbus High School and is taken aback at first by the lowly conditions. He is unable to control his class of poorly educated and poorly behaved students on the first day, but decides to use his street smarts and military tactics to gain the upper hand. Soon enough, he is able to take command of the students by displaying his combat self-defense techniques when students attack him.\n\nHe is warned not to use such methods by the principal, Claude Rolle, but gains the respect of his students when he bonds with them over the similarities between his early gang and [[Vietnam War]] experiences and their involvement in petty crime and [[street gangs]]. During this time, he befriends fellow schoolteacher Darrell Sherman and also crosses paths with Lacas, who is also one of his students.\n\nSuspicious of the odd conditions within the high school, Shale sets up surveillance cameras throughout the building. He discovers that Lacas orchestrated the attack on Hetzko. He also discovers that Lacas is secretly working with Rolle to distribute [[cocaine]] around Miami for a major narcotics ring. Shale and his team raid a drug deal, using the stolen money to buy music and sports equipment in the form of a \"school donation.\"\n\nWhile Sherman initially denies Shale's discovery, accusing him of being racist and trying to tear down the good works of Principal Rolle\u2014which he only does to keep himself at a distance and cover up a money-laundering avenue for Rolle's criminal enterprises\u2014Sherman and a female student inadvertently witness the drugs being loaded into one of the school buses later that day. Sherman tells the student to warn Shale and Hetzko, and creates a distraction, sacrificing himself.\n\nAware of Shale's interference at this point, Rolle orders a \"car accident\" for him, and sends Lacas after Hetzko. With the help of another student, Sherman is killed by Rolle. Shale and Brown save Hetzko by fighting and killing Lacas, and learn the full story from the female witness. Shale and his team garrison the school grounds to enter combat against the remaining KOD members, along with Johnny Glades, a Native American crime lord who wants his stolen money back from the busted deal; a rival mercenary company led by Janus; and Rolle himself. Ultimately, Shale and Joey Six kill all of the dealers and end up as the sole survivors of the battle. They walk away from the school grounds, discussing future operations as substitute teachers.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Tom Berenger]] as Jonathan Shale / James Smith\n* [[Ernie Hudson]] as Principal Claude Rolle\n* [[Diane Venora]] as Jane Hetzko\n* [[Glenn Plummer]] as Darrell Sherman\n* [[Marc Anthony]] as Juan Lacas\n* [[Cliff De Young]] as Matt Wolfson\n* Shar-ron Corley as Jerome Brown\n* [[Richard Brooks (actor)|Richard Brooks]] as Wellman\n* [[Raymond Cruz]] as Joey \"Six\"\n* [[Rodney A.
