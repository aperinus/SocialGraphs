G. Wells' War of the Worlds''''', also known as '''''Invasion''''' and '''''H. G. Wells' The Worlds in War''''' internationally, or simply as '''''War of the Worlds''''', is a [[direct-to-DVD]] [[science fiction film|science fiction]] war film produced by [[The Asylum]] and directed by David Michael Latt.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.grantland.com/story/_/id/8458773/a-look-how-ripoff-factory-called-asylum-makes-mockery-box-office|title=Mockbuster video|first=Tom |last=Breihan|publisher=Grantland.com|date=October 10, 2012|access-date=November 7, 2013}}</ref> It is a loose adaptation of the [[H. G. Wells]] [[The War of the Worlds|novel]], and a [[mockbuster]] of the [[DreamWorks Pictures|DreamWorks]]/[[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]] [[War of the Worlds (2005 film)|film based on the same source]], in addition to the third film adaptation overall.\n\nA contemporary translation of the novel set in the United States, ''War of the Worlds'' tells of an [[alien invasion|invasion of Earth]] by technologically-advanced [[Martian (War of the Worlds)|extraterrestrials]], from the perspective of an American astronomer trying to reunite with his family. It is the only adaptation besides the [[The War of the Worlds (1953 film)|1953 film]] in which the main character actively tries to repel the aliens. The film is loosely based on an unproduced screenplay called \"Invasion\", written by Carlos De Los Rios in 1997.\n\nThe DVD was released on June 28, one day before DreamWorks' film, and stars [[C. Thomas Howell]], [[Peter Greene]], and [[Jake Busey]]. The alternate title of ''Invasion'' is likely for the film's overseas distribution since [[Paramount Pictures]] claims to own exclusive film rights of the ''War of the Worlds'' title in the [[European Union]], but also derives from the original name of De Los Rios's screenplay. The film is The Asylum's most successful production to date, having sold over 250,000 copies from [[Blockbuster Inc.|Blockbuster]] upon its release.  A sequel, ''[[War of the Worlds 2: The Next Wave]]'', was released in 2008.\n\n==Plot==\nOn the surface of [[Mars]], the [[Mars Rover]] is destroyed by an unknown force. Astronomer George Herbert (Howell) and his wife Felicity (Van Wyk Loots) are packing for a trip to [[Washington, D.C.]] to celebrate their 10th wedding anniversary. George's son Alex spots a meteorite entering Earth's atmosphere. George is called to work about the incident, and his wife and son leave early for D.C. without him. As he drives to work, a meteorite lands. An [[Martian (War of the Worlds)|alien]] \"[[Tripod (War of the Worlds)|walker]]\" emerges from the crater and massacres the witnesses with an [[Heat-Ray|energy weapon]], George barely escaping with his life. George decides to meet with his brother Matt in Hopewell before moving on to Washington, D.C..\n\nDespite rumors that D.C. has suffered some of the worst of the invasion thus far, George moves onward and meets with Sgt. Kerry Williams, the last remaining member of his squad. George and Williams meet with Samuelson, a power-mad Lieutenant with unrealistic notions of resistance against the invaders, who rejects them as cowards. In Hopewell, the walkers launch a heavy insurrection and Matt dies in the trail of destruction. George and Williams are separated in the battle. A pastor, Victor, finds George and describes his belief that the invasion is a form of the [[Rapture]], but remains optimistic. The two go on together towards D.C.. Victor's faith is bruised when a hysterical member of his church curses God for the death of her children. George and Victor witness the final effort of the military against the walkers, who defeat them with [[Black smoke (The War of the Worlds)|toxic gas]].\n\nThe two seek refuge in the abandoned house of a veterinarian for food and medicine when the neighborhood is flattened by another meteorite, trapping them in the ruins. George observes the aliens harvesting humans while Victor becomes despondent, rejecting his faith. George finds rabies vaccines and plans to use it against the aliens. George successfully injects a curious alien, only for it to kill Victor and leave. Days later, the aliens vanish and George continues his journey on foot to D.C.. George reunites with Williams and a deranged Samuelson, who has given himself a [[battlefield promotion]]. Samuelson senselessly murders Williams, and George in turn murders Samuelson.\n\nGeorge finally reaches D.C., which is completely destroyed. George becomes suicidal until he finds that the aliens have all died, having no immunity to a human virus. George finds Felicity and Alex alive among the few human survivors.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[C. Thomas Howell]] as Dr. George Herbert\n* [[Andy Lauer]] as Sgt. Kerry Williams\n* Rhett Giles as [[Pastor]] Victor\n* [[Tinarie Van Wyk-Loots]] as Felicity Herbert\n* [[Jake Busey]] as Lt./General Samuelson\n* [[Peter Greene]] as Matt Herbert\n* Dashiell Howell as Alex Herbert\n* Edward DeRuiter as Max\n\n==Adapting the novel==\nDirector/editor/executive producer/co-writer [[David Michael Latt]] (who admits to never seeing the [[The War of the Worlds (1953 film)|Byron Haskin/George Pal version]] or the [[War of the Worlds (1988 TV series)|1988 television series]], but has been a fan of the H.G. Wells novel since childhood) made it clear that his film changed certain aspects from the source material in addition to the time and location. Most notable is that the [[Tripod (The War of the Worlds)|tripods]] have been changed to six-legged crab-like machines called \"walkers\" (a result of allowing the effects team creative freedom).\n\nThe aliens are indeed [[Martian (The War of the Worlds)|Martians]] (though the film never states this, it is suggested as an opening credit sequence uses shots of the Red Planet's landscape), but they bear little resemblance to their novel's counterparts. Whereas Wells described his invaders as bear-sized tentacled creatures, the film's Martians are insect-like with four tentacle-like legs. These aliens also have the ability to spit acid from their feet, which melts anything. At the end of the legs three tongue-like appendages closely resemble the Martian fingers from [[Byron Haskin]]'s 1953 film [[The War of the Worlds (1953 film)|version of ''The War of the Worlds'']] and the 1988 [[War of the Worlds (1988 TV series)|television series version]].\n\nThe war machines are [[crab]]-like \"walkers\" with six legs. A [[Heat Ray]] is built into the machine's \"head\", and is fired from a single eye. The fighting machines do not appear to have protection against modern artillery (avoiding the \"invisible shields\" seen in the [[The War of the Worlds (1953 film)|1953 film version]] and [[Steven Spielberg]]'s [[War of the Worlds (2005 film)|2005 film]]), leaving their ability to conquer unexplained. The aliens do have a substance similar to the [[Black smoke (The War of the Worlds)|black smoke]], but is more of a dense green [[toxic gas]] unable to rise above ground level, allowing survivors to escape by getting to high places.\n\nThe protagonist is George Herbert, a reference to [[H. G. Wells]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.egs.edu/library/herbert-george-wells/biography/|title=Herbert George Welles Biography|publisher=European Graduate School|access-date=November 10, 2013|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131110233428/http://www.egs.edu/library/herbert-george-wells/biography/|archive-date=November 10, 2013|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Rather than being a writer, as in the novel, he is an [[astronomer]]. The film leaves the ''eve of the war'' storyline and its characters almost completely absent. He also has a son, who is portrayed by Dashiell Howell, who is actually the son of George's actor [[C. Thomas Howell]].\n\nDespite these differences, George goes through much of what befalls the novel's protagonist, even in sacrificing himself to the Martians, only for them to drop dead of infection. He is also separated from his family and tries to reunite with them once the invasion begins, As in the novel, they are alive at the conclusion. George's brother, a [[United States Army Rangers|Ranger]], is less fortunate; he is seen only briefly after being fatally wounded in an attack by the invaders. In the book, the narrator's brother takes up a major narrative role.\n\nA major deviation from the text is that the protagonist actually tries to produce a means of stopping the Martians, but whether or not he is directly responsible for their downfall is ambiguous. There is a theme of disease throughout - George's son is seen suffering from a mild cold, while George himself suffers from a major fever which leaves him incapacitated for two days.\n\nThe novel's Artilleryman is divided into two characters. The first, Kerry Williams, exhibits the defeated status. He accompanies George as they move to unaffected areas, meeting soldiers oblivious to the danger they will soon face, until they become separated when George takes refuge underwater to evade the Martians. After his ordeal in the ruined house, George encounters the same defeatist Williams again. Instead, the other personality, portrayed in the novel's later stages, is Lt. Samuelson.\n\nThe novel's unnamed [[Curate]] is Victor in the film. While the two are very similar, Victor, a priest, is optimistic and is sure that the invasion is the [[Rapture]]. However, his faith is deeply shaken when he meets a congregant who screams against God for the loss of her family, causing Victor to question why he himself has yet to be taken. Unlike the Curate, Victor keeps his composure when he is trapped in the ruined house as he wrestles with his thoughts. Where the Curate had to be subdued in the novel, Victor regains his faith just before he is killed by the Martians.\n\nThe film includes homages to the [[The War of the Worlds (1953 film)|1953 film]]. The aliens' hands deliberately resemble those of the Martians of the 1953 film, and the protagonists of each film both actively try to weaken the aliens, another deviation from the novel.\n\n==Reception==\nFelix Vasquez Jr. of ''Cinema Crazed'' wrote: \"It really says something that it took three writers to produce such a piece of junk.\"<ref>{{cite web |date=2006 |author=Felix |title=H.G.
