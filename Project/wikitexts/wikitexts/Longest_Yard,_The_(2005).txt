A [[remake]] of 1974's ''[[The Longest Yard (1974 film)|The Longest Yard]]'', it stars [[Adam Sandler]] as a washed-up former professional quarterback who, in exchange for reduced prison sentence, is forced to assemble a [[American football|football]] team to play against the guards. The film co-stars [[Chris Rock]], [[James Cromwell]], [[Nelly]], [[William Fichtner]] and [[Burt Reynolds]], who played Sandler's role in the original.\n\nIt was released by [[Paramount Pictures]] in the United States and [[Sony Pictures Motion Picture Group#Sony Pictures Releasing|Sony Pictures Releasing]]\u2013under the [[Columbia Pictures]] label\u2013in other territories on May 27, 2005.\n\n== Plot ==\nPaul Crewe is a former [[National Football League|NFL]] [[quarterback]] who was accused of [[shaving points]], though it was never proven. Nevertheless, he was placed on federal probation for five years. One night, he gets drunk during a party and goes [[joyride (crime)|joyriding]] through [[San Diego]] in the [[Bentley]] of his girlfriend Lena, causing a police chase and the car to crash. His probation is revoked and he is sentenced to three years in prison as a result.\n\t\nUsing his influence and contacts, [[Texas]] warden Rudolph Hazen, an avid football fan, manages to have Crewe transferred into his prison as he wishes to use him as a coach for his personal football team composed of his prison guards to boost his reputation for future elections as State Governor. Using a week in a [[Box (torture)|hot box]] to coerce him, Crewe recommends that the Guards, led by head guard Captain Knauer, play a tune-up game, a game between the Guards and a team that they easily slaughter to boost morale. Hazen tasks Crewe with forming a team composed of the prison inmates, believing that he will be unable to unite the unruly prisoners, thus not only achieving his goals, but also exerting his power over the inmates.\n\nCrewe befriends Caretaker, who helps organize tryouts but finds a mostly inept roster due to Crewe's legacy. Seeing the team forming attracts former college football star Nate Scarborough, who decides to help coach the team by gathering several intimidating inmates, most of whom join in order to exact revenge against the abusive guards, bolstering his defense. Caretaker implores Crewe to seek out assistance from the black inmates to gain some much needed offensive strength and speed. Crewe challenges their leader, Deacon Moss, to a one-on-one basketball game but refuses to call any fouls on Deacon, despite them being blatant. Deacon wins and refuses to offer help, but Earl Megget is impressed by Crewe's resilience and joins as his [[running back]].\n\nAs the team gains strength, Hazen and the guards hinder Crewe's team in several ways, such as taunting Megget into attacking a guard by verbally harassing him at the library with [[ethnic slurs]]; Megget, however, does not retaliate. Deacon and the other black inmates witness this and decide to join Crewe's team to exact revenge. Meanwhile, inmate Unger spies on the activities of the inmates for the guards and is implored to use his \"talents\" to weaken their team. Unger rigs an incendiary explosive into the radio in Crewe's cell, which Caretaker accidentally sets off and is sealed within Crewe's cell by Unger, preventing anyone from rescuing him.\n\nOn game day, the inmates are revitalized in the wake of Caretaker's murder when they find he used his connections to his cousin at [[Reebok]] to supply the inmates with quality uniforms and gear as well as giving them the team name Mean Machine. Crewe deals with some difficulty getting the inmates to focus on winning the game during opening play, stating that a loss to them would be a far bigger mark of shame to the guards than any physical brutality they could inflict on them. Though the guards take an early lead, even having the referees call bogus fouls on them (which Crewe quickly amends by firing the football into the referee's crotch), by the end of the first half, the Mean Machines tie the game.\n\nHazen corners Crewe during half-time, during which he reveals that Unger killed Caretaker, and threatens to increase his prison sentence and pin Caretaker's death on him if he doesn't allow the guards a two-touchdown lead. Reluctantly, Crewe agrees. Hazen then orders Knauer to \"inflict as much damage as possible\" on the inmates once they get the lead. During the opening of the second half, Crewe deliberately throws the game and abandons his teammates despite their efforts to catch up in scoring. After earning a two touchdown lead on the Mean Machines, the Guards begin to brutally injure the inmates, spurring Crewe to re-enter the field. The inmates initially refuse to help him, allowing him to be [[Quarterback sack|sacked]] twice, but on 4th Down and long, Crewe completes a 1st Down on his own. Crewe confesses that he had threw the game that got him cut from the NFL, citing he owed debts to \u201cworse people\u201d. Informing the team of Hazen's threats, he declares that he would rather stay with the inmates than betray Caretaker's memory. The Mean Machines rally behind Crewe once more and with a decisive [[two-point conversion]], they win the game by a one-point margin.\n\nKnauer, having newfound respect for Crewe, congratulates him for the win and informs Crewe that he is aware that he had nothing to do with Caretaker's murder and would defend him. Hazen admonishes Knauer for losing a fixed game and notices that Crewe is heading towards the exit. Eagerly implying Crewe is trying to escape, Hazen orders that Crewe be shot. Knauer hesitates and at the last moment realizes, and scornfully informs Hazen, that Crewe is only picking up the game football. Crewe returns it to Hazen, telling him to \"stick it in [his] trophy case\". Deacon and Battle then [[Gatorade shower|dump Gatorade]] on Hazen, while Crewe and Scarbrough go to get information on where Unger is so that Switowski can deal with him.\n\n== Cast ==\n=== Cons ===\n{{castlist|\n* [[Adam Sandler]] as Paul \"Wrecking\" Crewe, QB\n* [[Chris Rock]] as James \"Caretaker\" Farrell\n* [[Nelly]] as Earl Megget, RB/KR\n* [[Burt Reynolds]] as Coach Nate Scarborough, TB\n* [[Bob Sapp]] as Switowski, DE\n* [[David Patrick Kelly]] as Unger\n* [[Terry Crews]] as \"Cheeseburger\" Eddy, TE\n* [[Nicholas Turturro]] as Brucie, WR/QB/K\n* [[Bill Goldberg]] as Joey \"Battle\" Battaglio, LB\n* [[Steve Reevis]] as Billy \"Baby Face Bob\" Rainwater\n* Lobo Sebastian as Torres, DB\n* [[The Great Khali|Dalip Singh Rana]] as Turley, FB\n* [[Joey Diaz|Joey \"Coco\" Diaz]] as Anthony \"Big Tony\" Cobianco, DL\n* [[Eddie Bunker]] as \"Skitchy\" Rivers\n* [[Tracy Morgan]] as Miss Tucker\n* [[Michael Irvin]] as Deacon Moss, WR\n* [[Stink Fisher]] as Cafeteria Prisoner, OL\n* [[D12]] as background cons\n}}\n\n=== Guards ===\n{{castlist|\n* [[William Fichtner]] as Captain Brian Knauer, QB\n* [[Bill Romanowski]] as Guard Lambert, LB\n* [[Brian Bosworth]] as Guard Garner, LB/TE \n* [[Kevin Nash]] as Sergeant Engleheart, DL\n* [[Stone Cold Steve Austin|Steve Austin]] as Guard Dunham, FB\n* [[Michael Papajohn]] as Guard Papajohn, KR/DB\n* [[Conrad Goode]] as Guard Webster\n* Brandon Molale as Guard Malloy, DL\n* Todd Holland as Guard Holland\n* John Hockridge as Guard Hock\n}}\n\n=== Other ===\n{{castlist|\n* [[James Cromwell]] as Warden Rudolph Hazen\n* [[Allen Covert]] as Walter\n* [[Rob Schneider]] as Punky\n* [[Chris Berman]] as Himself\n* [[Jim Rome]] as Himself\n* [[Patrick Bristow]] as Patrick\n* [[Lauren Sanchez]] as Herself\n* [[Dan Patrick (sportscaster)|Dan Patrick]] as Officer Jack Pugh\n* Christopher Neiman as Big Ear Cop\n* [[Ed Lauter]] as Duane\n* [[Sean Salisbury]] as Vic\n* [[Rob Moore (American football)|Rob \"Revolution\" Moore]] as Gavin\n* [[Big Boy (radio host)|Big Boy]] as Jesse\n* Marc S.
