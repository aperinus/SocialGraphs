The film is classified as part of the [[cin\u00e9ma du look]] movement.{{sfn|Austin|2008|page=147}}\n\n==Plot==\nHaving stolen some compromising documents from a powerful and successful [[entrepreneur]]/[[gangster]] at a party, a man known as Fred escapes from the police and takes refuge in the underground world of the [[Paris M\u00e9tro]] stations and tunnels. There he joins the dwellers and befriends several colourful characters, including others who are living under the subway to avoid police arrest. While the gangster's [[henchmen]] try to find Fred, he develops a romance with the gangster's young [[trophy wife]], H\u00e9l\u00e9na. She had originally invited Fred to the party featured at the opening of the film, and is bored with her gilded-caged life.\n\nFred forms a [[pop band]] with some of his friends, such as \"The Drummer\" and Enrico, who compose the songs. While Fred is working on this project, H\u00e9l\u00e9na's powerful husband pressures the police to find the fugitive. One of Fred's sidekicks, The Rollerskater, who has been wanted by the police for a long time, is captured by Commissioner Gesberg. Fred and his friend The Florist rob a train carrying money; The Florist escapes, leaving Fred with the loot.\n\nFred uses money from the robbery to pay off a chamber-music ensemble scheduled to perform in the subway station. His new band replaces them but, at their performance, Fred is searched for by both the police and a henchman of H\u00e9l\u00e9na's husband. The henchman shoots Fred while H\u00e9l\u00e9na is running towards him to warn him of the danger. The film ends with H\u00e9l\u00e9na kneeling beside Fred, who is lying on his back, looking content and singing along with the band. They are playing and being applauded by the audience in the background.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Isabelle Adjani]] as H\u00e9l\u00e9na Kerman\n*[[Christopher Lambert]] (as Christophe Lambert) as Fred\n*[[Richard Bohringer]] as The Florist\n*[[Michel Galabru]] as Commissioner Gesberg\n*[[Jean-Hugues Anglade]] as The Roller\n*[[Jean Bouise]] as The Station Master\n*[[Jean-Pierre Bacri]] as Inspector Batman\n*[[Jean-Claude Lecas]] as Robin\n*[[Pierre-Ange Le Pogam]] as Jean\n*[[Jean Reno]] as The Drummer\n*[[\u00c9ric Serra]] as Enrico (bassist)\n*[[Arthur Simms (singer)|Arthur Simms]] as Paul (singer)\n\n==Production==\n''Subway'' was filmed partially on location in the [[Paris M\u00e9tro]] and [[R\u00e9seau Express R\u00e9gional|Paris RER]], and partially on sets that were designed by [[Alexandre Trauner]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Konstantarakos|first=Myrto|date=1 January 2000|title=Spaces in European Cinema|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2XefIrfRuzkC&pg=PA14|publisher=Intellect Ltd|page=14|isbn=978-1841500041}}</ref> The opening car chase scene is said to pay homage to the 1971 film ''[[The French Connection (film)|The French Connection]]'', and the film's ending is based loosely on the ending of the 1960 film [[Breathless (1960 film)|''Breathless'']].{{sfn|Austin|2008|page=151}}\n\n===Soundtrack===\n[[\u00c9ric Serra]]'s score and other musical pieces from the soundtrack, such as Fred's band's song, \"It's Only Mystery\" (also written by Serra), were released on [[Vinyl record|vinyl]] and [[Cassette tape|cassette]] in 1985.
