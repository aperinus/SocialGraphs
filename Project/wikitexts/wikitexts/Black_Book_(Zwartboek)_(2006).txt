The film, credited as based on several true events and characters, is about a young [[Jewish]] woman in the [[Netherlands]] who becomes a spy for [[Dutch resistance|the resistance]] during [[World War II]] after tragedy befalls her in an encounter with the [[Nazi]]s. The film had its world premiere on 1 September 2006 at the [[Venice Film Festival]] and its public release on 14 September 2006 in the Netherlands. It is the first film that Verhoeven made in the Netherlands since ''[[The Fourth Man (1983 film)|The Fourth Man]]'', made in 1983 before he moved to the United States.\n\nThe press in the Netherlands was positive; with three [[Golden Calf (award)|Golden Calves]], ''Black Book'' won the most awards at the [[Netherlands Film Festival]] in 2006. The international press responded positively, as well, especially to the performance of Van Houten. It was nominated for the [[BAFTA Award for Best Film Not in the English Language]], and was the Dutch [[Submissions for the 79th Academy Award for Best Foreign Film|submission]] for the [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film|Best Foreign Language Film]] in 2007, but was not nominated.\n\nIt was [[List of most expensive Dutch films|three times more expensive than any Dutch film ever made]], and also the Netherlands' most commercially successful, with the country's highest box-office gross of 2006. In 2008, the Dutch public voted it the best Dutch film ever.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cinema.nl/artikelen/4084816/zwartboek-beste-film-aller-tijden |title=Zwartboek beste film aller tijden - Cinema.nl Nieuws |language=nl |publisher=Cinema.nl |access-date=25 November 2010}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1944, [[History of the Jews in the Netherlands|Dutch-Jewish]] singer Rachel Stein is hiding from the Nazi regime in the [[German occupation of the Netherlands|occupied Netherlands]]. When the farmhouse where she has been hiding is destroyed by an Allied bomber, she goes to see a lawyer named Smaal, who has been helping her family. He arranges for her to escape to the liberated southern part of the country. Aided by a man named Van Gein, Rachel is reunited with her family and boards a boat that is to take them and other refugees to the south. However, they are ambushed on the river by members of the German [[Schutzstaffel|SS]], who kill them and rob the bodies of valuables. Rachel alone survives, but does not manage to escape from occupied territory.\n\nUsing a non-Jewish alias, Ellis de Vries, Rachel becomes involved with a [[Dutch resistance]] group in the [[The Hague|Hague]], under the leadership of Gerben Kuipers and working closely with a doctor, Hans Akkermans. Smaal is in touch with this Resistance cell. When Kuipers's son and other members of the Resistance are captured, Ellis agrees to help by seducing local [[Sicherheitsdienst#Inland-SD|SD]] commander ''[[Hauptsturmf\u00fchrer]]'' Ludwig M\u00fcntze. At a party at the local SD headquarters, Ellis recognises ''[[Obersturmf\u00fchrer]]'' G\u00fcnther Franken, M\u00fcntze's brutal deputy, as the officer who had overseen the massacre of refugees on the boat. She obtains a job as a secretary at the SD headquarters while also falling in love with M\u00fcntze who, in contrast to Franken, is not abusive or sadistic. He realises that she is a Jew, but does not care.\n\nThanks to a [[Covert listening device|hidden microphone]] that Ellis plants in Franken's office, the Resistance realises that Van Gein is the traitor who betrayed Rachel, her family, and the other Jews to the SS. Against Kuipers's orders, Akkermans decides to abduct Van Gein to expose him. Their attempt goes wrong, and Van Gein is killed. Franken responds by planning to kill 40 hostages, including most of the plotters, but M\u00fcntze, who realises the war is lost and has been negotiating with the Resistance, countermands the order.\n\nM\u00fcntze forces Ellis to tell him her story. On her evidence, he confronts Franken with a superior officer, ''[[Obergruppenf\u00fchrer]]'' K\u00e4utner, who orders Franken to open his safe, expecting to find the valuables stolen from the Jews he had killed, this being a capital offence. However, the safe contains no valuables, and Franken then tells K\u00e4utner that M\u00fcntze has been negotiating with Dutch resistance \"terrorists\" for a truce. M\u00fcntze is imprisoned and condemned to death. The Resistance plots to rescue their imprisoned members; Ellis agrees to cooperate only on the condition that they also free M\u00fcntze. The plan is betrayed, and the would-be rescuers find the prisoners' cells filled with German troops. Only Akkermans and one other man manage to flee.\n\nEllis is subsequently arrested and taken to Franken's office. He knows about her and the bug and, knowing that the Resistance is listening in, he stages a confrontation to make them believe that Ellis is the [[Collaboration with the Axis Powers during World War II|Nazi collaborator]], responsible for the failure of the rescue. Kuipers and his companions swear to make her pay for her treason. Ronnie, a Dutch woman working at the SD headquarters to whom Ellis had confided her role in the Resistance, helps her and M\u00fcntze escape.\n\nWhen the country is liberated by the Allies, Franken attempts to escape by boat, but is killed by Akkermans, who takes the Jewish loot. Suspecting Smaal is the traitor, M\u00fcntze and Ellis return to confront him. Smaal states that the identity of the traitor is evidenced by his 'black book', in which he had detailed all his dealings with Jews. However, he refuses to discuss further, wanting to go to the Canadian authorities. When they are about to leave, Smaal and his wife are killed by an unknown assailant. M\u00fcntze chases him into the street, only to be recognised by the Dutch crowd and arrested by soldiers from the [[Canadian Army]]. The Dutch also recognise Ellis and arrest her as a collaborator, but not before she grabs the black book.\n\nM\u00fcntze is brought before the ranking Canadian officers and finds that K\u00e4utner is helping to keep order among the defeated German forces. K\u00e4utner convinces a Canadian colonel that under [[German military law|military law]], the defeated German military retains the right to punish its own soldiers. Due to the previously issued death warrant, M\u00fcntze is executed by a firing squad.\n\nEllis is imprisoned with other accused collaborators, and humiliated and tortured by the violently anti-Nazi volunteer jailers, but rescued by Akkermans, who is now a colonel in the [[Royal Netherlands Army|Dutch Army]]. Akkermans brings her to his medical office, and says that he killed Franken when the Nazi tried to escape. He shows her the valuables stolen from Jewish victims. When informed about M\u00fcntze's fate, Ellis goes into shock, and Akkermans administers a tranquilliser which is in fact an [[Drug overdose|overdose]] of [[insulin]]. Ellis, feeling dizzy, sees the bottle of insulin and survives by quickly eating a bar of chocolate. She realises then that Akkermans is the traitor who had collaborated with Franken and had killed the Smaals. While Akkermans is distracted, waving to a crowd that cheers him, she jumps from the balcony into the crowd below, and runs away. He tries to follow, but is blocked by the crowd.\n\nEllis proves her innocence to Canadian military intelligence and to the former Resistance leader Gerben Kuipers by means of Smaal's black book, which lists how many Jews had been taken to Akkermans for medical help just prior to their murders. Together, Ellis and Kuipers intercept the fleeing Akkermans, who is hiding in a coffin in a hearse with the stolen money, gold, and jewels. They kill the driver, and while Kuipers drives the hearse, Ellis screws down the coffin's secret air vents. They drive to [[Hollands Diep]] where the original SS trap had been sprung, and wait until Akkermans suffocates. Ellis and Kuipers wonder what to do with the stolen money and jewels.\n\nThe scene changes to [[Israel]] in 1956, reprising the opening scenes, and shows Rachel meeting her husband and their two children, and walking back into [[Kibbutz]] Stein, with a sign at the gate announcing that it was funded with recovered money from Jews killed during the war. In the final scene, the tranquility of Rachel and her family is interrupted by explosions heard in the distance; the siren announces an air attack and Israeli soldiers position themselves at the front of the kibbutz.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Black Book 2005 film set.jpg|thumb|Film set of ''Black Book'' in [[The Hague]] in 2005]]\n\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Carice van Houten]] as Rachel Stein, alias Ellis de Vries\n* [[Sebastian Koch]] as Ludwig M\u00fcntze (SS-Hauptsturmf\u00fchrer)\n* [[Thom Hoffman]] as Hans Akkermans\n* [[Halina Reijn]] as Ronnie\n* [[Waldemar Kobus]] as G\u00fcnther Franken (SS-Obersturmf\u00fchrer)\n* [[Derek de Lint]] as Gerben Kuipers\n* [[Christian Berkel]] as General (SS-Obergruppenf\u00fchrer) K\u00e4utner, superior of G\u00fcnther Franken and Ludwig M\u00fcntze in the [[Sicherheitsdienst]]\n* [[Dolf de Vries]] as Mr. Smaal, attorney who keeps the black book\n* [[Peter Blok]] as Mr. Van Gein, policeman who betrays those trying to leave occupied territory\n* [[Michiel Huisman]] as Rob, sailor who helps Rachel Stein\n* Ronald Armbrust as Tim Kuipers, son of Gerben Kuipers, a [[Communist Party of the Netherlands|communist]], and a member of the resistance group\n* [[Frank Lammers]] as Kees, member of the resistance group\n* [[Matthias Schoenaerts]] as Joop, member of the resistance group\n* [[Johnny de Mol]] as Theo, devout Christian and member of the resistance group\n* [[Xander Straat]] as Maarten, member of the resistance group\n}}\n\n==Production==\n===Writing===\n[[File:People of Eindhoven line the streets.jpg|thumb|People in [[Eindhoven]] watching the [[Allies of World War II|allied forces]] enter the city following its liberation, similar to the depiction of the liberation in ''Black Book'']]\nAfter 20 years of filmmaking in the United States, Verhoeven returned to his homeland, the Netherlands, for the making of ''Black Book''.
