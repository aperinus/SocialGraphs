Upon its initial 1974 release in West Germany and the United States, ''Blood for Dracula'' was released as '''''Andy Warhol's Dracula'''''.\n\nThe film involves [[Count Dracula]] arriving in Italy to feast upon the blood of virgins, only to find difficulty with this due to the lack of virgins present in Italy.\n\nFilming began shortly after the completion of ''[[Flesh for Frankenstein]]''. Italian director [[Antonio Margheriti]] is credited in Italian prints of the film despite not directing it. This misattribution led both producer [[Carlo Ponti]] and Margheriti to be put on trial for \"continued and aggravated fraud against the state\" by attempting to gain benefits by law for Italian films.{{sfn|Curti|2017|p=118}}\n\nAccording to the [[American Film Institute]], the film opened to mixed reviews.\n\n==Plot==\nIn the early 1920s, a sickly and dying [[Count Dracula]], who must drink virgin blood to survive, travels from [[Transylvania]] to pre-[[Fascist Italy (1922\u20131943)|Fascist]] Italy, following his servant Anton's plan and thinking he will be more likely to find a virgin in a [[Catholic countries|Catholic country]]. At the same time, all of Dracula's family has vanished because of two reasons: the lack of virgins in their hometown and how the family's reputation prevents any normal family from choosing to bring women to [[Castle Dracula|Dracula's castle]]. Shortly after arriving in Italy, Dracula befriends Il Marchese di Fiore (de Sica), an impecunious Italian landowner who, with a lavish estate falling into decline, is willing to marry off one of his four daughters to the wealthy aristocrat.\n\nOf di Fiore's four daughters, Saphiria and Rubinia regularly enjoy the sexual services of Mario, the estate's handyman, a proud peasant and staunch [[Marxist]] who believes that the [[socialist revolution]] will happen soon in his country. Esmeralda and Perla (eldest and youngest, respectively) are virgins; Esmeralda thought too plain and past her prime for marriage and Perla only 14 years old (portrayed by 23-year-old Dionisio). Dracula obtains assurances that all the daughters are virgins and drinks the blood of the two who are considered marriageable. However, their \"tainted\" blood reveals to him the truth and makes him even weaker. Nevertheless, he is able to turn the two girls into his telepathic slaves.\n\nSoon after the Marchese di Fiore travels out of Italy to pay his great debts, Mario discovers that Dracula is a vampire and what he has done to the di Fiore sisters. When he realizes the danger Dracula poses to Perla, the youngest, he uses the excuse of protecting her to [[rape]] her. Mario then warns di Fiore's wife, La Marchesa di Fiore, about Dracula's plan. Meanwhile, Dracula has drunk the blood of Esmeralda, turning her into a vampire and regaining strength. La Marchesa confronts, and is stabbed by, Anton, whom she shoots and kills before dying. Mario [[dismemberment|dismembers]] Dracula with an axe, killing him and Esmeralda with a stake, and becomes the [[de facto]] master and manager of the estate.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Udo Kier]] as [[Count Dracula]]\n* [[Joe Dallesandro]] as Mario Balato, the worker\n* Arno Juerging as Anton, Dracula's manservant\n* [[Vittorio de Sica]] as Il Marchese di Fiore\n* [[Maxime McKendry]] as La Marchesa di Fiore\n* [[Milena Vukotic]] as Esmeralda\n* [[Dominique Darel]] as Saphiria\n* [[Stefania Casini]] as Rubinia\n* [[Silvia Dionisio]] as Perla\n* [[Roman Polanski|Roman Pola\u0144ski]] (uncredited) as man in tavern<ref>{{cite news |author=Staff writer |date=25 July 1974 |title='Warhol's Dracula' to be Entered in Atlanta Festival |url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/166556480/ |volume=93 |edition=late final |at=Part IV, p. 17 |newspaper=Los Angeles Times|quote='Dracula' stars Joe Dallesando, Udo Kier, Arno Juerging, Vittoria de Sica, with a cameo appearance by Roman Polanski |via=[[Newspapers.com]]}}</ref>\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Stefania Casini and Joe Dallesandro (1974).jpg|thumb|From left to right: [[Stefania Casini]] and [[Joe Dallesandro]] in 1974, the year ''Blood for Dracula'' was released]]\n\nIn 1973, [[Paul Morrissey]] and [[Joe Dallesandro]] came to Italy to shoot a film for producers Andrew Braunsberg and [[Carlo Ponti]].{{sfn|Curti|2017|p=81}} The original idea came from director [[Roman Polanski]] who had met Morrissey when promoting his film ''[[What?
