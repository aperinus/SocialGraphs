In the film, two strong-minded women are forced to cooperate when budget cuts threaten to shut down a small-town choir.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gossipcop.com/dolly-parton-queen-latifah-joyful-noise/ |title=Dolly Parton Returns to Film, Stars with Queen Latifah |work=[[Gossip Cop]] |date=August 21, 2010 |access-date=December 7, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-date=October 8, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111008080539/http://www.gossipcop.com/dolly-parton-queen-latifah-joyful-noise/ |publisher=Gossip Cop Media}}</ref> The film received mixed reviews, with praise for its songs and acting but criticism of its script and tone.\n\n==Plot==\nAfter the untimely death of a small-town church choir director Bernard Sparrow, ([[Kris Kristofferson]]) in Pacashau, [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], Vi Rose Hill ([[Queen Latifah]]), a practical mother raising two teenagers alone, takes control of the choir using the traditional Gospel style that their Pastor Dale ([[Courtney B. Vance]]) approves of. However, the director's widow, G. G. Sparrow ([[Dolly Parton]]), the main benefactor to the church, believes she should have been given the position. As in previous years, the choir reaches the regional finals of the national amateur \"Joyful Noise\" competition, only to be disappointed when a rival choir beats them. Tough times in the town have led to budget problems that threaten to close down the choir, at a time when the town needs the choir's inspiring music more than ever.\n\nVi Rose has a son, Walter ([[Dexter Darden]]), who has [[Asperger syndrome]], and a talented, beautiful and independent daughter, Olivia ([[Keke Palmer]]), who detests being under her mother's household rules. G. G. has recently begun caring for her rebellious, drifter grandson, Randy ([[Jeremy Jordan (actor, born 1984)|Jeremy Jordan]]). A romance blossoms between Olivia and Randy, which is strongly opposed by Vi Rose. Olivia also has a rival suitor, Manny (Paul Woolfolk). At Randy's urging, G. G., Olivia and most of the choir come to believe that some more contemporary arrangements (prepared by Randy) would be more successful for the choir. It also turns out that the choir has a chance at the national finals of the competition when the rival choir is found to have cheated by hiring professionals. But the pastor says that the church will not sponsor the choir unless they continue to use their reverent, traditional style.\n\nVi Rose's husband, Marcus (Jesse L. Martin), enlisted in the army after having trouble finding work at home, but his prolonged absence has saddened his family and causes additional tension between Vi Rose and Olivia. Meanwhile, a vivacious member of the choir who choreographs their routines, Earla (Angela Grovey), after a long dry stretch, finds passion first with Mr. Hsu (Francis Jue), whose weak heart gives way by morning, and later with Justin (Roy Huang). The town's tough times forces another choir member, Caleb (Andy Karl), and his family out of business. Vi Rose and G. G. come to blows in a confrontation at a crowded diner where Vi Rose is then fired from her job, Olivia's frustration with her mother boils over, and G. G. threatens Pastor Dale with disendowing the church if the choir is not allowed to compete in the finals with the new arrangements.\n\nDuring the movie Randy befriends Walter and begins to teach him how to play the piano. One day, while at the quarry Randy and Walter are hanging out as Manny arrives. Randy and Manny begin to fight over Olivia ending with Randy giving Manny a bloody nose. When returning home Walter brags to Vi Rose about the fight. Angered by the news, she throws out Randy and tells him to leave her family alone. Randy, however, is able to befriend Manny and convince him to help out the choir with his guitar skills.\n\nThe choir travels to [[Los Angeles County, California|Los Angeles]] for the finals, feeling very unsettled. Vi Rose and Olivia have a fight and Vi Rose slaps Olivia. Tough competition presents itself in the form of a choir made up of cute pre-teens, with a charismatic young soloist (Ivan Kelley Jr.). But Vi Rose, G. G., Olivia and Randy pull the choir together and they give a rousing performance, using the new arrangements and choreography, capturing first place. The choir returns to town in triumph. One year later Earla and Justin get married and then Marcus comes back to his family.\n\n==Cast==\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Queen Latifah]] as Vi Rose Hill, Olivia's mother.\n* [[Dolly Parton]] as G. G.
