Marion]]), the alcoholic skipper of a coal barge in New York, receives a letter from his estranged twenty-year-old daughter Anna \"Christie\" Christofferson ([[Greta Garbo]]), telling him that she'll be leaving Minnesota to stay with him. Chris left Anna to be raised by relatives on a St. Paul farm 15 years before, and hasn't seen her since.\n\nAnna arrives an emotionally wounded woman with a dishonorable, hidden past: she has worked in a brothel for two years. One night, Chris rescues Matt ([[Charles Bickford]]) and two other displaced sailors from the sea. Anna and Matt soon fall in love and Anna has the best days of her life. But when Matt proposes to her, she is reluctant and haunted by her recent past. Matt insists and compels Anna to tell him the truth. She opens her heart to Matt and her father, disclosing her dark secrets.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Greta Garbo]] as Anna Christie\n* [[Charles Bickford]] as Matt Burke\n* [[George F.
