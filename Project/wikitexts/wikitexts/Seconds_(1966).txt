The screenplay by [[Lewis John Carlino]] was based on the 1963 novel of the same title by David Ely.\n\nFilmed in New York and [[Malibu, California]], in 1965, ''Seconds'' was entered into the [[1966 Cannes Film Festival]] and released by [[Paramount Pictures]]. The cinematography by [[James Wong Howe]] was nominated for an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]].<ref>[https://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/1967 1967|Oscars.org]</ref><ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LVl6zcYN4Kg Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? and A Man for All Seasons Wins Cinematography: 1967 Oscars]</ref>\n\nIn 2015, the United States [[Library of Congress]] selected the film for preservation in the [[National Film Registry]], finding it \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/ghostbusters-top-gun-enter-national-849092 |title='Ghostbusters,' 'Top Gun,' 'Shawshank' Enter National Film Registry |author=Mike Barnes |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |date=December 16, 2015 |access-date=December 16, 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nArthur Hamilton is a middle-aged banking executive in New York who, despite his professional success, remains profoundly unfulfilled. His love for his wife, Emily, has dwindled, and he seldom sees his only child, now grown.\n\nArthur is approached by a stranger who gives him an address. Later that day he receives a call from Charlie, his school friend from Harvard whom he believed to be dead. Charlie recounts personal anecdotes that only he could know. Charlie informs Arthur that he must go the address provided, and that the Company will save him from his empty life. \n\nArthur takes up Charlie's proposition, and travels to the address, then is redirected through a circuitous series of addresses. At one location, he is  drugged and tries to leave the complex. He wanders around until finding himself in a vulnerable woman's bedroom and, in his drugged state, he seemingly sexually assaults her. \n\nAfter waking, Arthur is informed by the Company's Mr. Ruby that their service costs $30,000. It will fake his death in a hotel fire using an anonymous cadaver, then reshape his appearance and provide a fresh start.  When Arthur is unsure, an older man, head of the Company, shows Arthur a film of the prior staged assault, ostensibly to make his decision easier.\n\nAfter considering the emptiness in his life, Arthur reluctantly accepts. He undergoes multiple extensive procedures by Dr. Innes that transform not only his facial features, but his vocal cords, teeth, and even fingerprints.\n\nAfter a lengthy healing period, the younger looking Arthur is conferred the identity Tony Wilson. Tony is relocated by the Company into a beachside community in California. He attempts to assimilate into his new life, in which he is able to live as an artist \u2014a career he had always aspired to\u2014 though he soon finds himself growing restless. While walking the beach one day, Tony encounters Nora. The two develop a swift attraction, and Nora recounts how she came to leave her former life behind.\n\nTony accompanies Nora to a Dionysian-themed party in Santa Barbara. There, the revelers dance, sing, and stomp grapes in a large trough and, after some initial discomfort, Tony finally begins to enjoy himself.\n\nTony and Nora host a cocktail party for neighbors. Tony gets drunk over the course of the night, and begins to speak openly about his former identity. The male guests  remove Tony to a bedroom, where he learns that they are also \"reborns\".\n\nTony receives a phone call from Charlie, who warns him that he has put himself in danger by violating the Company's rules. Charlie also reveals that Nora is an employee of the Company who covertly helps new \"reborns\" to a smooth transition.\n\nDisenchanted by his new contrived life, Tony defiantly returns to New York. He arranges a meeting with Emily at his former home, claiming that he was once a friend of Arthur's. Emily shares that she felt Arthur was emotionally disconnected from his life, and was in a constant state of longing that she could not understand. After the meeting, a melancholic Tony is met by associates of the Company, and he requests that they give him a different identity. They agree to do so, but only if he can provide them with another referral to the Company.\n\nReturning to the Company\u2019s headquarters, Tony is placed in a waiting room with various other men, including his friend Charlie, all of whom have asked to undergo another 'rebirth'. An elated Charlie is chosen and is escorted from the waiting room. Frustrated at the unknown amount of time the men have been waiting to be chosen, and being unable to think of anyone that he can refer to the Company, Arthur angrily demands that his procedure be performed without further delay.\n\nDuring the night, the owner of the Company discusses with Tony/Arthur his original purpose for founding the organization, and assures him that the issues he has brought up will be looked into. As he is wheeled into the operating room, Dr. Morris gives his last rites. As Dr. Innes sedates him, he tells Arthur that he is to be killed, with his body to be staged as the corpse for a new client to be reborn.\n\n==Cast==\n<!--- [[WP:NOTDATABASE]] - cast and order per opening stand-alone credits, roles per closing credits scroll --->\n{{cast list|\n* [[Rock Hudson]] as Antiochus \"Tony\" Wilson\n* [[Salome Jens]] as Nora Marcus\n* [[John Randolph (actor)|John Randolph]] as Arthur Hamilton\n* [[Will Geer]] as Old Man\n* [[Jeff Corey]] as Mr. Ruby\n* [[Richard Anderson]] as Dr. Innes\n* [[Murray Hamilton]] as Charlie\n* [[Karl Swenson]] as Dr. Morris\n* [[Khigh Dhiegh]] as Davalo\n* [[Frances Reid]] as Emily Hamilton\n* [[Wesley Addy]] as John\n* John Lawrence as Texan\n* [[Elisabeth Fraser]] as Plump Blonde\n* [[Dodie Heath|Dody Heath]] as Sue Bushman \n* [[Robert Brubaker]] as Mayberry\n* [[Dorothy Morris]] as Mrs. Filter\n* [[Barbara Werle]] as Secretary\n}}\n\n==Analysis==\nIn the film ''[[The Pervert's Guide to Ideology]]'', the psychoanalytical [[Marxist]] philosopher [[Slavoj \u017di\u017eek]] discusses the film as an example of what happens when desires are fulfilled.<ref name=\"Zizek\">{{cite AV media |people=Slavoj Zizek |year= 2012 |title=[[The Pervert's Guide to Ideology]] |medium=Motion picture |publisher=[[Zeitgeist Films]]}}</ref>\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nFrankenheimer had recently completed several successful films prior to his involvement with the project, namely ''[[Birdman of Alcatraz (film)|Birdman of Alcatraz]]'' (1962), ''[[The Manchurian Candidate (1962 film)|The Manchurian Candidate]]'' (1962), and ''[[Seven Days in May]]'' (1964). These last two films together with ''Seconds'' are sometimes referred to as Frankenheimer's '[[paranoia]] trilogy'.<ref name=\"Seconds\"/>\n\n===Casting===\nFor the central role of Antiochus \"Tony\" Wilson, Frankenheimer had sought [[Kirk Douglas]], whose company, [[Bryna Productions|Joel Productions]], was producing the film.<ref name=desowitz/> When Douglas was unavailable due to other commitments, Frankenheimer offered the role to [[Laurence Olivier]].<ref name=desowitz/> After reading the screenplay, Olivier agreed to take the part, but Paramount Pictures objected to the casting, believing that Olivier was not a big enough star at the time.<ref name=desowitz/> Hudson was ultimately cast in the feature, despite attempts by friends and colleagues to dissuade him.

While shooting the sequences inside The Company's headquarters (which were constructed on the Paramount Studios lot), Howe employed an innovative system, which featured \"complete lighting of sets for closeups, long shots, etc., sans separate setups, plus the use of ceilinged sets.\"<ref name=afi/> Filming was completed in August 1965.<ref name=afi/>\n\nIn Frankenheimer's commentary on the DVD, he notes:\n*An actual [[rhinoplasty]] operation was filmed to provide shots for inclusion in the depiction of Hamilton's plastic surgery. Frankenheimer shot some of the footage himself after the cameraman fainted.\n*The scenes in Wilson's Malibu beach house were filmed in Frankenheimer's own home.\n\n===Post-production===\nThe opening titles of the film were designed by [[Saul Bass]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.artofthetitle.com/title/seconds/ |title=Seconds |website=www.artofthetitle.com |access-date=February 7, 2019}}</ref><ref>[https://www.flavorwire.com/456683/art-house-science-fiction-films-you-might-have-missed Art House Science Fiction Films You Might Have Missed - Flavorwire]</ref> using [[Helvetica]] set in white over optically warped black-and-white motion picture photography.
