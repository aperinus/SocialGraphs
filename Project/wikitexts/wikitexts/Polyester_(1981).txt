It satirizes the melodramatic genre of [[woman's film|women's pictures]], particularly those directed by [[Douglas Sirk]], whose work directly influenced this film, as well as a satire of suburban life in the early 1980s involving [[divorce]], [[abortion]], [[adultery]], [[alcoholism]], [[foot fetishism]], and the [[Christian right|religious right]].\n\n''Polyester'' was filmed in Waters' native [[Baltimore, Maryland]], as with many of his other films, and features a gimmick called Odorama, whereby viewers can smell what they see on screen using [[scratch and sniff]] cards, in a stylistic tribute to the work of [[William Castle]], whose films typically featured attention-grabbing gimmicks.\n\nFollowing ''[[Stunts (film)|Stunts]]'', it was one of the first films that [[New Line Cinema]] produced.\n\n==Plot==\nEarly 1980s housewife Francine Fishpaw watches her upper-middle-class family's life crumble in their suburban Baltimore home. Her husband Elmer is a [[polyester]]-clad lout who owns an [[adult movie theater]], causing anti-[[pornography]] protesters to picket the Fishpaws' house. Francine's Christian beliefs are also offended by the behavior of her children&mdash;Lu-Lu, her spoiled, promiscuous daughter, and Dexter, her [[Juvenile delinquent|delinquent]], [[Inhalant abuse|glue-sniffing]] son who derives sexual pleasure from stomping on women's feet.\n\nFrancine's [[cocaine]]-snorting mother La Rue, a class-conscious snob, compounds her troubles by robbing her daughter blind, constantly deriding her [[Obesity in the United States|obesity]], and berating her for befriending her former housecleaner, Cuddles Kovinsky, a simple-minded woman who tries to console Francine with \"[[Carpe diem|seize-the-day]]\" [[Bromide (language)|bromides]] and has inherited a large sum of money from a very wealthy former employer.\n\nAfter Francine discovers Elmer having an affair with his secretary, Sandra Sullivan, she confronts them during a motel tryst and demands a divorce. Francine then falls into [[alcoholism]] and [[Depression (mood)|depression]], exacerbated by her children's behavior: Lu-Lu becomes [[Pregnancy|pregnant]] by her degenerate boyfriend Bo-Bo Belsinger ([[Stiv Bators]]) and announces she is getting an abortion, and after Dexter is arrested at a supermarket for stomping on a woman's foot, the media reveal that he is the Baltimore Foot Stomper who has been serially attacking and terrorizing local women.\n\nLu-Lu goes to a family planning clinic for an abortion, but [[Pro-life movement in the United States|anti-abortion]] picketers harass her. She returns home and tries to induce a [[miscarriage]], causing Francine to call an unwed mothers' home. Two nuns arrive, force Lu-Lu into the trunk of their car, and take her to a [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] home for unwed mothers. Bo-Bo and his friend, who have come to trash the Fishpaw house on [[Halloween]] night, shoot La Rue, but she retrieves the gun and shoots Bo-Bo dead. After Lu-Lu flees the unwed mothers' home, she returns home to find Bo-Bo's dead body and is so distraught that she attempts suicide. Francine comes home and faints after witnessing her daughter's suicide attempt&mdash;and the apparent suicide by hanging of the family dog, Bonkers, based on a [[suicide note]] left near the dog's dangling body.\n\nHowever, Francine's life soon starts to change. Dexter is released from jail, having been rehabilitated. Lu-Lu suffers a miscarriage from her suicide attempt and is contrite about her past, becoming an artistic [[flower child]] who embraces [[macram\u00e9]]. Francine quits drinking, confronts and rebukes her mother, and finds new romance with Todd Tomorrow. Todd proposes marriage to an elated Francine, but she soon discovers that Todd and La Rue are romantically involved and conspiring to embezzle her divorce settlement, drive her [[Insanity|insane]] and sell her children into [[Sex trafficking|prostitution]].\n\nElmer and Sandra break into the house to murder Francine, but Dexter and Lu-Lu kill them: Dexter steps on Sandra's foot, causing her to accidentally shoot Elmer, and Lu-Lu uses her macram\u00e9 to strangle Sandra. When Cuddles and her German chauffeur and fianc\u00e9 Heintz arrive, their car runs over La Rue and Todd, killing them. The film concludes with a happy ending for Francine, her children, and newlyweds Cuddles and Heintz.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Divine (performer)|Divine]] as Francine Fishpaw\n* [[Tab Hunter]] as Todd Tomorrow\n* David Samson as Elmer Fishpaw\n* [[Edith Massey (actress)|Edith Massey]] as Cuddles Kovinsky\n* [[Mink Stole]] as Sandra Sullivan\n* Ken King as Dexter Fishpaw\n* Mary Garlington as Lu-Lu Fishpaw\n* Joni Ruth White as La Rue\n* [[Stiv Bators]] as Bo-Bo Belsinger\n* Hans Kramm as Heintz\n* Rick Breitenfeld as Dr. Arnold Quackenshaw\n* [[Susan Lowe]] as Shirley Evans, mall victim\n* [[Cookie Mueller]] as Betty Lalinski\n* George Hulse as Principal Kirk\n* Michael Watson as Freddy Ashton\n* [[Mary Vivian Pearce]] and Sharon Niesp as Nuns\n* [[Jean Hill (actress)|Jean Hill]] as Gospel bus hijacker\n* [[Leo Braudy (academic)|Leo Braudy]] as Abortion picketer\n* [[Dorothy Braudy]] as Abortion picketer\n* [[George Figgs]] as Abortion picketer\n* Marina Melin as Supermarket Victim\n* [[Jay Leno]] as Journalist On TV News (Uncredited)\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n[[Image:John Waters by David Shankbone.jpg|thumb|[[John Waters]]]]\nWaters' usual troupe of actors, the [[Dreamlanders]], played minor roles in ''Polyester'' compared to Waters' previous films ''[[Desperate Living]]'', ''[[Female Trouble]]'', and ''[[Pink Flamingos]]'', which starred several Dreamlanders in major roles. Only two Dreamlanders, [[Divine (performer)|Divine]] and [[Edith Massey (actress)|Edith Massey]], received top billing in this film. This was also Massey's final collaboration with Waters before her death in 1984. Dreamlander perennials [[Mink Stole]], [[Mary Vivian Pearce]], [[Cookie Mueller]], Sharon Niesp, Marina Melin, [[Susan Lowe]], and Jean Hill played small roles in ''Polyester''. While their parts are integral to the plot, they are much smaller compared to their earlier roles.\n\nPrincipal photography for the film took place over the course of three weeks in October 1979.\n\n''Polyester'' was the first Waters film to skirt the mainstream, even garnering an [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system|R rating]] (his previous films were all unrated or rated X&mdash;the equivalent of the [[Motion Picture Association of America]]'s present-day NC-17 rating). The film was set in a middle-class suburb of Baltimore instead of its slums and bohemian neighborhoods, the setting of Waters' earlier films.\n\nDuring an interview on [[The Ghost of Hollywood]], cinematographer David Insley revealed that the helicopter used to shoot the opening scenes had to make an emergency landing on a nearby golf course     while it was open. After the helicopter was cleared for safety, it was subsequently towed from the fairway using a flatbed.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|date=2021-01-06|title=Episode Seven|url=https://kboo.fm/media/100189-episode-seven|access-date=2021-11-18|website=KBOO|language=en}}</ref><ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|title=Season One|url=https://theghostofhollywood.com/season-one-1|access-date=2021-11-18|website=The Ghost of Hollywood|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nThis was David Insley's third film working for John Waters and his first as lead cinematographer. He would go on to shoot [[Hairspray (1988 film)|Hairspray]] and [[Cry-Baby]] as well.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===Music===\nThese are the only songs known to be in the film:<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0082926/soundtrack|title=Polyester (1981)|work=IMDb|access-date=February 22, 2015}}</ref>\n# \"Polyester\" by [[Tab Hunter]] \u2013 words and music by [[Chris Stein]] and [[Debbie Harry]]\n# \"Be My Daddy's Baby (Lu-Lu's Theme)\" by [[Michael Kamen]] \u2013 words and music by Harry and Kamen\n# \"The Best Thing\" by [[Bill Murray]] \u2013 words and music by Harry and Kamen\n\n===Women's pictures===\n''Polyester'' was a send-up of [[Woman's film|women's pictures]], an [[Exploitation film|exploitative genre of film]] that was popular from the 1950\u201360s and typically featured bored, unfulfilled, or otherwise troubled women, usually middle-aged suburban [[Housewife|housewives]], finding release or escape through the arrival of a handsome younger man. Women's pictures were typically hackneyed B-movies, but Waters specifically styled ''Polyester'' after the work of the director [[Douglas Sirk]], asking David Insley to make use of similar lighting and editing techniques, even using film equipment and movie-making techniques from Sirk's era. By chance, Insley was able to view some of Sirk's films at a local screening celebrating the Director. He would use this experience when developing the visuals for Polyester.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===Odorama===\n[[File:Odorama-geruchskarte.jpg|thumb|Original German Odorama card for the film]]\nOdors, especially Francine's particularly keen sense of smell, play an important role in the film. To highlight this, Waters designed Odorama, a \"scratch-and-sniff\" gimmick inspired by the work of [[William Castle]] and the 1960 film ''[[Scent of Mystery]]'', which featured a device called [[Smell-O-Vision]]. Special cards with spots numbered 1 through 10 were distributed to audience members before the show, in the manner of [[Stereoscopy|3D glasses]]. When a number flashed on the screen, viewers were to scratch and sniff the appropriate spot. Smells included the scent of flowers, [[pizza]], glue, gas, grass, and feces. For the first DVD release of the film the smell of glue was changed due to, as Waters states, \"political correctness\".  The gimmick was advertised with the tag \"It'll blow your nose!\"<ref>[[Neil Gaiman]], [[Kim Newman]], ''[[Ghastly Beyond Belief]]'', [[Arrow Books]], 1985, {{ISBN|0-09-936830-7}}, p. 193</ref>\n\nAfter being prompted to scratch and sniff a bouquet of roses, viewers are subjected to a series of mostly foul-smelling odors, and thus fall victim to the director's  prank.\n\nThe ten smells (developed by 3M per John Waters in the supplements section of the DVD release) are:\n\n# Roses\n# Flatulence\n# Model airplane glue\n# Pizza\n# Gasoline\n# Skunk\n# Natural gas\n# New car smell\n# Dirty shoes\n# Air freshener\n\nA video release omits the numbers flashing onscreen as well as the opening introduction explaining Odorama. This version, created by [[Lorimar-Telepictures]], was shown on cable TV in the United States.\n\nThe [[IFC (U.S. TV channel)|Independent Film Channel]] released reproduction Odorama cards for John Waters [[film festival]]s in 1999.\n\nWaters expressed his delight at having the film's audiences actually \"pay to smell shit\" on the commentary track of the film's 2004 DVD release.\n\nProducers of ''[[Rugrats Go Wild]]'' ([[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]]) used the Odorama name and logo in 2003, somewhat upsetting Waters when he learned that [[New Line Cinema]] had let the copyright lapse.<ref>{{cite video|people=Waters, John|date=2006|title=The Simpsons The Complete Eighth Season DVD commentary for the episode \"Homer's Phobia\"|medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref><ref>{{cite video|people=Waters, John|date=2006|title=''[[This Filthy World]]''|medium=DVD|publisher=[[Red Envelope Entertainment]]}}</ref>\n\nThe 2011 film ''[[Spy Kids: All the Time in the World]]'' uses a scratch and sniff card now called \"Aromascope\", which is advertised as providing the fourth dimension in its \"4D\" format.\n\nThe film was re-screened by Midnight Movies at the [[Edinburgh International Film Festival]] in June 2011. The Odorama cards were recreated by Midnight Movies, Little Joe Magazine, and The Aroma Company to allow viewers to interact with the film as originally intended.\n\n==Critical response==\n''Polyester'' received some positive reviews from the mainstream press. Said [[Janet Maslin]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'':\n{{cquote|Ordinarily, Mr. Waters is not everyone's cup of tea &mdash; but ''Polyester'', which opens today at the National and other theaters, is not Mr. Waters' ordinary movie. It's a very funny one, with a hip, stylized humor that extends beyond the usual limitations of his outlook. This time, the comic vision is so controlled and steady that Mr. Waters need not rely so heavily on the grotesque touches that make his other films such perennial favorites on the weekend [[midnight movie|Midnight Movie]] circuit. Here's one that can just as well be shown in the daytime.<ref>{{cite news\n|work=New York Times\n|title='POLYESTER,' AN OFFBEAT COMEDY\n|last=Maslin|first=Janet\n|date=29 May 1981\n|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/05/29/movies/polyester-an-offbeat-comedy.html\n}}</ref>}}\n\nThe film holds a 93% rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on reviews from 27 critics.<ref>{{rotten-tomatoes|polyester|Polyester}}</ref>\n\n==In popular culture==\nThe 2000 single \"[[Frontier Psychiatrist]]\", by the Australian electronic music group [[The Avalanches]], [[Sampling (music)|samples]] the film.<ref>{{cite web |author1=David James Young |title=The Avalanches reflect on 20 years of 'Frontier Psychiatrist' |url=https://www.nme.com/news/music/the-avalanches-20-year-anniversary-frontier-psychiatrist-2785303 |website=[[NME]] |publisher=[[BandLab Technologies]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201015081534/https://www.nme.com/news/music/the-avalanches-20-year-anniversary-frontier-psychiatrist-2785303 |archive-date=15 October 2020 |date=15 October 2020 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{wikiquote|Polyester}}\n* {{IMDb title|0082926}}\n* [https://www.criterion.com/current/posts/6590-polyester-the-perils-of-francine ''Polyester: The Perils of Francine''] an essay by Elena Gorfinkel at the [[Criterion Collection]]\n\n{{John Waters}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Polyester}}\n[[Category:1981 films]]\n[[Category:1980s black comedy films]]\n[[Category:American black comedy films]]\n[[Category:American independent films]]\n[[Category:American satirical films]]\n[[Category:Adultery in films]]\n[[Category:Films about abortion]]\n[[Category:Films about dysfunctional families]]\n[[Category:Films directed by John Waters]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Michael Kamen]]\n[[Category:Films set in Baltimore]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Baltimore]]\n[[Category:Films with scents]]\n[[Category:1981 comedy films]]\n[[Category:1980s English-language films]]\n[[Category:1980s American films]]"}]}}}}
