Heinlein]]. Set in the 23rd century, the film follows the exploits of teenager, Johnny Rico, and his friends while serving in the military under the Earth [[world government]], the United Citizen Federation. Humanity's exploration and colonisation of outer space brings them into conflict with an alien species, known as Arachnids, leading to an [[interstellar war]]. It stars [[Casper Van Dien]], [[Dina Meyer]], [[Denise Richards]], [[Jake Busey]], [[Neil Patrick Harris]], [[Patrick Muldoon]], and [[Michael Ironside]].\n\nDevelopment of ''Starship Troopers'' began in 1991 as a separate project called ''Bug Hunt at Outpost 7'', written by Neumeier. Producer [[Jon Davison]] noticed many similarities between Neumeier's work and Heinlein's book and had him re-work the script to more closely follow the novel and gain more interest from studio executives. Even so, development was slow, with studios remaining non-committal on funding the expensive project up to the filming date. Filming began in April 1996 on a $100\u2013110{{nbsp}}million budget, nearly half of which was committed to the extensive computer-generated (CGI) and practical effects required to vivify the Arachnid creatures, before concluding that October.\n\n''Starship Troopers'' was released on November 7, 1997, to some initial box office success but negative reviews from critics who perceived the film as promoting fascism, including accusations against Verhoeven and Neumeier of being Nazis, as well as criticism over its violence and performances. The reviews and poor word-of-mouth led to box office grosses dropping week on week until it left theaters, as only the [[1997 in film|34th highest-grossing film]] of the year. Verhoeven believed the misconceptions about the film were the result of poor marketing that presented ''Starship Troopers'' as an action film instead of a satire.\n\nSince its release, ''Starship Troopers'' has been critically re-evaluated, and is now considered a [[Cult following|cult classic]], one of the greatest science fiction films ever made, and a prescient satire of fascism and authoritarian governance that has grown in relevancy. The film helped launch a [[Starship Troopers (franchise)|multimedia franchise]] that includes four sequels, ''[[Starship Troopers 2: Hero of the Federation]]'' (2004), ''[[Starship Troopers 3: Marauder]]'' (2008), ''[[Starship Troopers: Invasion]]'' (2012), and ''[[Starship Troopers: Traitor of Mars]]'' (2017), as well as an animated television series, ''[[Roughnecks: Starship Troopers Chronicles]]'' (1999), video games, comics, and a variety of merchandise.\n\n== Plot ==\n<!-- Per [[WP:FILMPLOT]], film plots should be between 400 and 700 words. -->\nIn the 23rd century,{{efn|In the director's commentary, available on the ''Starship Troopers'' DVD release, Paul Verhoeven confirmed the film takes place in the 23rd century.<ref name=\"ScreenRant15Things\"/><ref name=\"CBRFascism\"/>}} Earth is governed by the United Citizen Federation, a [[stratocracy|military organization]] founded generations earlier by the \"veterans\" after democracy and social scientists brought civilization to the brink of ruin. Citizenship is gained only through federal service, which grants rights restricted from ordinary civilians such as voting and breeding. Now spacefaring, humans conduct colonization missions throughout the galaxy, bringing them into conflict with a race of highly evolved insectoid creatures dubbed \"Arachnids\" or, derisively, \"bugs\".\n\nDespite the protestations of his parents about the risks, teenage sports jock Johnny Rico enlists for Federal Service as a mobile infantryman to remain close to his girlfriend, spaceship fleet pilot Carmen Ibanez. Their [[psychic]] friend Carl Jenkins joins [[Military Intelligence]], while Isabelle \"Dizzy\" Flores, who is in love with Rico, deliberately transfers to his squad. Carmen eventually breaks up with Rico because their career paths separate them and she has developed a mutual attraction with fellow pilot Zander Barcalow. During training, Rico impresses [[Drill instructor|drill sergeant]] Zim, earning a promotion to squad leader, but makes a mistake during a training exercise causing the death of one of his squad and the resignation of another, resulting in his demotion and [[flagellation]]. Rico resigns from the military, but reconsiders after learning that an asteroid sent by the Arachnids has destroyed [[Buenos Aires]], killing millions, including his parents.\n\nAn invasion force is deployed to Klendathu, the Arachnids' home planet, but the military intelligence underestimates the Arachnids' defensive abilities, leading to thousands of troop deaths. Badly wounded, Rico is rescued by lieutenant Jean Rasczak, his former high-school teacher, but is mistakenly reported dead, devastating Carmen. Following his recovery, Rico, Dizzy, and squadmate Ace Levy join Rasczak's [[special forces|special forces unit]], the \"Roughnecks\". Rico eventually earns the rank of Corporal for his feats against the Arachnids, including killing a gigantic \"Tanker Bug\" on Tango Urilla, and becomes romantically involved with Dizzy. The Roughnecks respond to a distress call on Planet P, where they reconnoitre an Arachnid-ravaged outpost but are quickly overwhelmed by the bugs. Carmen and Zander recover the surviving Roughnecks by dropship, but not before Dizzy is killed and Rico is forced to euthanize the mutilated Rasczak. The group returns to the fleet assembled in orbit above P, where Dizzy is eulogized.\n\nJenkins, now a high-ranking colonel, explains the Roughnecks were deliberately sent into the trap, justifying it as a necessary sacrifice to prove the existence of a \"Brain Bug\", an intelligent Arachnid strategically directing the others. He grants Rico command of the Roughnecks and [[Battlefield promotion|field-promotes]] him to lieutenant, ordering that he return to P to capture the Brain Bug. As the battle commences, Carmen's ship is destroyed by the Arachnids, forcing her and Zander to flee in an escape shuttle that crash lands into an underground tunnel system. The pair are captured by the Arachnids and the Brain Bug uses its [[proboscis]] to consume Zander's brain, absorbing his knowledge. Rico sends his squad to complete their mission while he, Ace, and their squadmate Watkins find Carmen and hold the Arachnids at bay with a [[Tactical nuclear weapon|miniature nuclear bomb]].\n\nThe Brain Bug escapes while the Arachnids attack and mortally wound Watkins, who sacrifices himself by detonating the bomb while his teammates escape. On the surface, they learn that Zim has captured the Brain Bug, and the assembled troops rejoice as Jenkins psychically detects it is afraid. A [[propaganda]] advertisement details how the Brain Bug is being invasively studied to learn its secrets and ensure humanity's victory. The advert encourages the viewers to enlist and do their part in the war so they can become like Carmen, now captain of her own ship, and Rico, who enthusiastically leads his troops into another battle.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{multiple image\n| total_width = 500\n| direction = horizontal\n| align = right\n| footer = (Left to right) [[Casper Van Dien]] (pictured in 2012), [[Dina Meyer]] (2012), and [[Denise Richards]] (2009)\n| image1 = Casper Van Dien by Gage Skidmore.jpg\n| alt1 = A photograph of Casper Van Dien\n| image2 = Dina Meyer by Gage Skidmore.jpg\n| alt2 = A photograph of Dina Meyer \n| image3 = Denise Richards 2009.jpg\n| alt3 = A photograph of Denise Richards\n}}\n* [[Casper Van Dien]] as Johnny Rico: A school sports star turned military infantryman<ref name=\"TheVergeRetro\"/><ref name=\"NewYorkerRetro\"/><ref name=\"ScreenRantWherearethey\"/>\n* [[Dina Meyer]] as Dizzy Flores: Rico's former classmate who joins the mobile infantry<ref name=\"NewYorkerRetro\"/><ref name=\"ScreenRantDizzy\"/>\n* [[Denise Richards]] as Carmen Ibanez: An aspiring starship pilot and Rico's girlfriend<ref name=\"WaPoReviewKempley\"/>\n* [[Jake Busey]] as Ace Levy: A military infantryman<ref name=\"ScreenRantWherearethey\"/>\n* [[Neil Patrick Harris]] as Carl Jenkins: A psychic who joins military intelligence.<ref name=\"NewYorkerRetro\"/><ref name=\"ScreenRantWherearethey\"/>\n* [[Clancy Brown]] as Sgt.

The pair eventually realized their writing partnership was no longer working and Neumeier began developing a story treatment called ''Bug Hunt at Outpost 7''.{{sfn|Sammon|1997|p=6}}<ref name=\"DeadspinRetro\"/><ref name=\"TheAtlanticMisunderstood\"/> He said, \"I wanted to do a big, silly, jingoistic, xenophobic, let's-go-out-and-kill-the-enemy movie, and I had settled on the idea that it should be against insects{{nbsp}}... I wanted to make a war movie, but I also wanted to make a teenage romance movie.\"{{sfn|Sammon|1997|p=6}}<ref name=\"LATimesSep1996\"/> Insects were chosen as the enemies based on Neumeier's wife's strong fear of the creatures.<ref name=\"LATimesSep1996\"/>\n\nIn December 1991, Neumeier brought his idea to Davison at [[Warner Bros. Studios, Burbank]], which also headquartered [[TriStar Pictures]], with whom Davison had a pre-existing development deal.{{sfn|Sammon|1997|p=6}} After discussing Neumeier's idea, Davison realized it bore many similarities to the 1959 science fiction novel, ''[[Starship Troopers]]'', by [[Robert A. Heinlein]].{{sfn|Sammon|1997|p=6}}<ref name=\"GuardianHowwemade\"/> The novel had received a strongly divided reception on its release for promoting military power and necessary violence while criticizing [[social liberalism|liberal social programs]], but it had remained an enduringly popular work for over four decades.{{sfn|Sammon|1997|p=vii}}\n\nNeumeier and Davison had both read the novel as children and considered directly adapting ''Starship Troopers'' instead of Neumeier's story. However, Davison believed the film adaptation rights would have already been purchased by that point and encouraged Neumeier to continue his original idea, later retitled ''Outpost 7''.{{sfn|Sammon|1997|pp=6\u20137}} By late 1992, Davison was working out of [[Sony Pictures Studios]], [[Culver City, California|Culver City]], when Neumeier brought him the finished ''Outpost 7'', alternately referred to as ''Bug Hunt''. Although Davison liked the treatment, it failed to impress TriStar executive [[Chris Lee (producer)|Chris Lee]], who rejected it. Undeterred, Neumeier and Davison decided to research the film rights to ''Starship Troopers'', believing the more well-known intellectual property would change Lee's mind. They learned the rights were available and instead pitched making ''Starship Troopers''. Lee was more receptive, but the pair also received broader support from other executives including TriStar head of production, [[Mike Medavoy]], who had been similarly supportive of making ''RoboCop''.{{sfn|Sammon|1997|p=7}} With the studio's support in place, the rights to ''Starship Troopers'' were purchased and Neumeier began adapting his ''Outpost 7'' script to more closely fit Heinlein's novel.{{sfn|Sammon|1997|p=7}}<ref name=\"DeadspinRetro\"/><ref name=\"ScreenRantRetro\"/>\n\n===Development as ''Starship Troopers''===\n[[File:Paul Verhoeven Cannes 2016.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=A 2016 photograph of Paul Verhoeven|left|[[Paul Verhoeven]] (pictured in 2016) was the only person considered to direct ''Starship Troopers'']]\nProgress of the ''Starship Troopers'' adaptation remained slow for the next few years as TriStar began regularly replacing executives, including Medavoy, and high-value or risky projects were more closely scrutinized.{{sfn|Sammon|1997|p=14}}<ref name=\"GuardianHowwemade\"/><ref name=\"NewYorkerRetro\"/> Even so, Davison spent much of 1993 securing several key crew including Tippett and their other ''RoboCop'' collaborator, [[Paul Verhoeven]].{{sfn|Sammon|1997|pp=8\u201310, 14}} According to Neumeier and Davison, they had only ever considered Verhoeven as the director because they determined the fantastical creatures, genre, and political subtext suited his creative sensibilities.{{sfn|Sammon|1997|pp=9\u201310}}<ref name=\"GuardianHowwemade\"/><ref name=\"NewYorkerRetro\"/><ref name=\"SyFyRetro\"/> Verhoeven said, \"I like science fiction movies. I mean, the ''[[Star Wars]]'' series is delightful, you know? ...{{nbsp}}but the main reason I decided to do ''Starship Troopers'' was Phil Tippett. I had worked with Phil on ''RoboCop'' and felt that was really interesting{{nbsp}}...\" Verhoeven considered himself the director of the live characters, and described Tippett as effectively his co-director, leading filming of the creatures.{{sfn|Sammon|1997|p=11}} Verhoeven also brought in [[Alan Marshall (producer)|Alan Marshall]] as a producer, having worked with him on ''[[Basic Instinct]]'' (1992) and his current project, ''[[Showgirls]]'' (1995).{{sfn|Sammon|1997|pp=11\u201320}} Verhoeven was in need of a promising project as, despite his previous successes leading into the early 1990s, his efforts to develop the pirate adventure, ''Mistress of the Seas'', and the [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]]-starring ''Crusade'', had failed, and ''Showgirls'' became a financial failure as well as earning him the worst reviews of his career.<ref name=\"SyFyRetro\"/>{{sfn|Sammon|1997|pp=10\u201311}}<ref name=\"EscapistRetro\"/>\n\nBy 1994, the studio had still not agreed to move ''Starship Troopers'' out of the development phase and into pre-production. Key crewmembers, including Davison and Verhoeven, decided to produce test footage to demonstrate their intended visual style and tone.{{sfn|Sammon|1997|p=16}}<ref name=\"LATimesSep1996\"/> Although still busy filming ''Showgirls'' at this point, Verhoeven was determined to direct the sequence himself. The scene was storyboarded and detailed enough that Tippett's design for the \"Warrior Bugs\" changed little by the time of actual filming.{{sfn|Sammon|1997|p=17}}<ref name=\"LATimesSep1996\"/> The resulting 40-second to 2-minute scene, dubbed the \"Bug Test\", was filmed on July 21, 1994, at [[Vasquez Rocks]] near Los Angeles at a cost of $225,000 provided by TriStar.{{sfn|Sammon|1997|pp=16\u201317}}<ref name=\"LATimesSep1996\"/> Filmed by [[John Hora]] with a 30-person crew, the sequence depicts a soldier (played by [[Mitch Gaylord]]) being pursued and killed by two Warrior Bugs; Neumeier makes a cameo appearance as a dead soldier.{{sfn|Sammon|1997|p=17}} The visual effects were finished by September, and the completed Bug Test screened for TriStar executives in early October.{{sfn|Sammon|1997|p=18}}\n\nExecutives including Lee and [[Mark Canton]] were impressed with the visual effects and did not realize they had been produced with [[computer-generated imagery]] (CGI) and approved moving into pre-production, but others remained non-committal on providing any substantial funding as, according to Neumeier, they did not understand the project.<ref name=\"LATimesSep1996\"/>{{sfn|Sammon|1997|p=18}} Development continued at a slow pace into early 1995 when Davison put together a detailed budget totalling $90{{nbsp}}million, based on Neumeier's third draft.{{sfn|Sammon|1997|pp=13, 18\u201319}} Davison said TriStar was reluctant to provide this amount, often bringing up the financial failure of the $200{{nbsp}}million-budgeted ''[[Waterworld]]'' (1995), which was seen by industry experts as an example of excessive spending and had led to the firing of many involved executives at [[Universal Pictures]].{{sfn|Sammon|1997|p=13}} TriStar executives determined that the only way for ''Starship Troopers'' to continue development was to identify a business partner with whom they could split the production costs.{{sfn|Sammon|1997|p=19}} Davison said he began screening the Bug Test for anyone he could, eventually attracting the interest of [[Walt Disney Studios (division)|Walt Disney Studios]].{{sfn|Sammon|1997|p=20}} A meeting was held with, among others, Canton and [[Marc Platt (producer)|Marc Platt]] from TriStar owner, Sony, Disney's head of motion pictures, [[Joe Roth]], Verhoeven, Davison, and Marshall.{{sfn|Sammon|1997|p=20}} An agreement was made that the studios would produce ''Starship Troopers'' via TriStar and Disney's [[Touchstone Pictures]], splitting the budget costs and box office profits evenly, in exchange for Touchstone receiving all distribution rights to the film outside of the United States (U.S.) and Canada.{{sfn|Sammon|1997|p=20}}<ref name=\"LAtimesTouchstoneSony\"/> Each studio was also given creative input on the film and its marketing.<ref name=\"LAtimesTouchstoneSony\"/>\n{{-}}\n\n===Writing===\n[[File:Edward Neumeier 2007.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=A photograph of Edward Neumeier|Writer [[Edward Neumeier]] (pictured in 2007)]]\nNeumeier began adapting the ''Starship Troopers'' novel at the beginning of 1993, working out of his office in [[Eagle Rock, Los Angeles]].{{sfn|Sammon|1997|pp=8\u20139}}<ref name=\"NewYorkerRetro\"/> He was initially concerned about how to translate the tone of Heinlein's work, recalling his awareness as a youth of the controversy surrounding the novel that identified Heinlein as alternately a [[Conservatism|conservative]], [[militarism|militarist]], [[Libertarianism|libertarian]], and [[fascism|fascist]].{{sfn|Sammon|1997|pp=3, 11\u201312}}<ref name=\"EmpireDutch\"/> The novel espouses the benefits of military service, citizenship, and masculinity.<ref name=\"EmpireDutch\"/> Heinlein described the central theme  as being \"that a man, to be truly human, must be unhesitatingly willing at all times to lay down his life for his fellow man. [This theme] is based on the twin conceps of love and duty-and how they are related to the survival of our race.\"{{sfn|Sammon|1997|p=4}} Neumeier was interested to write about fascism but was concerned it would be difficult to do so successfully. Even so, he and Davison wanted to faitfhully adapt the novel's and Heinlein's viewpoint, and Neumeier believed audiences would appreciate the concept of a failing democracy and stricter cultural controls. He said, \"you want a world that works? Okay, we'll show you one. And it really does work. It happens to be a military dictatorship, but it works. That was the original rhythm I was trying to play with, just to sort of mess with the audiences.\"{{sfn|Sammon|1997|p=12}}\n\nNeumeier struggled adapting certain aspects, finding the first and third acts to be narratively strong but the middle act, focusing on Rico's boot camp experience, to be a lengthy piece \"preaching to his readership,\" which would not make for an interesting film.{{sfn|Sammon|1997|p=12}} He identified the elements he considered essential, including the high school opening, boot camp, battles, and the underlying philosophy and sociopolitics, and compensated for the novel's second act by expanding on sequences such as the high school romance, basing it on his own experiences of chasing women with no interest in him.{{sfn|Sammon|1997|pp=12\u201313}} The first draft was completed on July 8, 1993.{{sfn|Sammon|1997|p=11}} It remained generally faithful to Heinlein's novel, including a secondary alien race known as the \"Skinnies,\" the \"Bounce\"\u2014a jet-assisted traversal method, and power armor, which granted the troops superhuman strength.{{sfn|Sammon|1997|p=13}} Rasczak's lecture on citizenship was also paraphrased from the novel.{{sfn|Sammon|1997|pp=65\u201366}} A copy was sent to Heinlein's wife who was pleased despite the minor differences to the novel.{{sfn|Sammon|1997|p=13}}\n\nHowever, as development progressed, many aspects would be changed or removed, in part because of financial reasons, but also Verhoeven's influence.{{sfn|Sammon|1997|pp=12, 30}}<ref name=\"DeadspinRetro\"/> Verhoeven tried to read the novel but \"stopped after two chapters because it was so boring{{nbsp}}... it is really quite a bad book{{nbsp}}... it's a very [[Right-wing politics|right-wing]] book.\"<ref name=\"EmpireDutch\"/><ref name=\"CBRRetro\"/><ref name=\"DeadspinRetro\"/> He had Neumeier summarize the narrative for him, and found it militaristic, fascistic, and overly supportive of armed conflict, which clashed with Verhoeven's childhood experiences in [[Netherlands in World War II|German-occupied Netherlands]] during [[World War II]].{{efn|Attributed to multiple references:<ref name=\"GuardianHowwemade\"/><ref name=\"NewYorkerRetro\"/><ref name=\"DeadspinRetro\"/><ref name=\"CBRRetro\"/><ref name=\"EmpireDutch\"/><ref name=\"ScreenRantRetro\"/>}} Verhoeven determined that he could use the basic plot to satirize and undermine the book's themes by deconstructing the concepts of [[totalitarianism]], fascism, and militarism, saying \"All the way through I wanted the audience to be asking, 'Are these people crazy?'\"<ref name=\"CBRRetro\"/><ref name=\"EmpireDutch\"/><ref name=\"SyFyRetro\"/>{{sfn|Sammon|1997|p=vii}}\n\nBy 1994, Verhoeven was still filming ''Showgirls'', but remained active in the second draft. Among his suggestions was to introduce a romantic subplot between Rico and Carmen, and combined the male character Dizzy with a Neumeier-created female called Ronnie who was romantically interested in Rico. This in turn led Neumeier to develop a romantic triangle between Dizzy, Rico, and Carmen, and Rico, Carmen, and Zander.{{sfn|Sammon|1997|p=19}} Other aspects were removed such as the Skinnies, because Verhoeven thought too many alien races would be confusing, while queen bugs and advanced canines called Neo-dogs were considered financially unviable.{{sfn|Sammon|1997|p=30}} Another financially motivated change was the removal of \"the Drop\", a method of dropping troops from orbit in capsules that shed consecutive layers during landing, leading to the nickname \"Cap Troopers\".{{sfn|Sammon|1997|p=30}} Preliminary designs were made of the capsules but were generally attached to parachutes which was did not match the intended aesthetic, and adding rockets was deemed impractical because it would have required numerous different visual effects and taken too much time to accomplish, so they settled for dropships.{{sfn|Sammon|1997|p=31}} The most substantial change was making the enemy more insect-like, as Verhoeven did not want to \"see a bug with a gun in his hand.\u201d<ref name=\"LATimesSep1996\"/>\n\nThe Bounce was also removed due to cost and because Marshall said they made the troops look like they were on pogo sticks and removed the threat of the Arachnids if troops could easily jump away.{{sfn|Sammon|1997|p=31}} The most controversial omission from the novel, for fans, was the power armor. Davison said that despite the importance of the armor, it was financially impossible to create hundreds of suits for the cast and extras.{{sfn|Sammon|1997|pp=32\u201333}} He and Verhoeven initially agreed to use the power armor sparingly, and integrate various different ideas such as the Bounce and weapons into them, but later determined it gave the troops too much of an advantage against the Arachnids. Additionally, as development continued, any further increase in costs risked the production being cancelled entirely.{{sfn|Sammon|1997|p=33}} The FedNet sequences, the main source of information in the future, was invented for the film. An intentional prediction of how Neumeier believed television and computers would eventually be combined, the sequences were depicted in a way that would excite a population with very patriotic narration.{{sfn|Sammon|1997|p=64}} Verhoeven described the final script as being about contemporary American politics, such as a lack of [[Gun politics in the United States|gun control]] and increasing [[Capital punishment in the United States|capital punishment]] under Texas governor [[George W. Bush]], which he believed could potentially lead to fascism.

Conscious that the Arachnids, among other CGI elements, would be added after filming, he wanted a detailed image of how each scene would be set out during filming.{{sfn|Sammon|1997|pp=19,36}} Storyboard artists, Robin Richesson and Giacomo Ghiazzi, refined Verhoeven's storyboards, the bulk of the comic-book\u2013style art being done by Ghiazzi.{{sfn|Sammon|1997|p=36}}\n\nMany key crew members were hired during 1996, including Verhoeven's long-time cinematographer, [[Jost Vacano]],<ref name=\"ASCMag\"/>{{sfn|Sammon|1997|pp=28, 42}} as well as [[Vic Armstrong]] ([[second unit director]] and [[stunt coordinator]]), [[Mark Goldblatt]] ([[film editor|editor]]), [[John Richardson (special effects designer)|John Richardson]] ([[special effects supervisor]]), [[Basil Poledouris]] ([[composer|music composer]]), Stacey McIntosh (construction coordinator), Karen Higgins (construction foreman), Gregg Goldstone (first assistanct director), Kenneth Silverstein (second assistant director), John Blake (makeup artist), Kathy Blondell (hair stylist), William Petrotta (prop master), Robert \"Rock\" Galotti (weapons coordinator),{{sfn|Sammon|1997|p=42}} production manager [[Robert Latham Brown]], production coordinator Daren Hicks, and assistant production coordinators Janet Campolito and Lisa Hackler.{{sfn|Sammon|1997|p=39}} Tippett also began hiring the nearly 100 additional staff required to realize the Arachnids, including Jules Roman ([[Tippett Studio]] visual effects producer), [[Craig Hayes]] (visual effects artist), [[Trey Stokes]] (Animation department head), Adam Valdez and Blake Clark (animators), Paula Luchessi (lead cg painter), \nJulie Newdoll (supervisor of CG lighting), Brennan Doyle (lead compositor), Desiree Mourad (lighting), and Joanna Ladolcetta (lead rotoscoper).{{sfn|Sammon|1997|p=28}} Davison's responsibilities focused mainly on the special effects, while Marshall was concerned more with the filming.{{sfn|Sammon|1997|p=24}}\n\nProduction designer Allan Cameron and location manager Bill Bowling scouted several locations but rejected most as they did not consider them unique enough. Others, such as the [[Valley of Fire State Park]] in Nevada had too many environmental restrictions which could impact filming. The situation was made more difficult by an [[1995\u20131996 United States federal government shutdowns|extended period of U.S. government shutdowns]], which made obtaining the necessary filming and associated permits protracted, so they intentionally avoided further scouting of national or state parks or government-owned land. This restriction limited their options, however, particularly for impactful scenery.{{sfn|Sammon|1997|p=52}} Bowling eventually discovered Hell's Half Acre, located just outside of the town of [[Casper, Wyoming]], which offered \"colorful buttes and pinnacles,\" which could portray the alien planets of Klendathu and Planet P.{{sfn|Sammon|1997|pp=52\u201353}}<ref name=\"StrangeHorizons\"/> The location was remote, however, being about {{cvt|45|mile|km}} from the Astaire Building or hotels and requiring an hour drive every morning at 5am. It offered other logistical challenges as it was generally undeveloped land, so the production had to build roads for the trucks carrying their gear into the canyons for filming.{{sfn|Sammon|1997|p=56}} Anything that could not be driven in had to be lowered by helicopter.<ref name=\"ASCMag\"/> Construction of some on-location sets such as Whiskey Outpost camp began in February 1996 and took six weeks.{{sfn|Sammon|1997|p=53}}<ref name=\"ASCMag\"/> The local government was supportive of the project, helping subsidized the costs of building the roads and camp.{{sfn|Sammon|1997|p=56}} They later learned that the area was rife with rattlesnakes, although no crew was bitten.{{sfn|Sammon|1997|p=56}}\n\nAnother, more easily accessible location, Barry Barber Ranch near [[Kadoka, South Dakota]] and the [[Badlands National Park]], featured little vegetations and smooth, undulating landscape, which could serve as Tango Urilla.{{sfn|Sammon|1997|p=53}}<ref name=\"VarietyTango\"/><ref name=\"StrangeHorizons\"/> Even as pre-production continued, Davison remained concerned about the studio's ongoing executive turnover and its inconsistent commitment to funding, saying \"I felt the plug could always be pulled on us any minute.\"{{sfn|Sammon|1997|p=53}} In contrast, Verhoeven believed the repeated regime changes at the studio meant the project was being overlooked until it was too late to cancel it.<ref name=\"GuardianHowwemade\"/><ref name=\"NewYorkerRetro\"/><ref name=\"AVClubVerhoevenInt\"/><ref name=\"RollingStoneVerho2016\"/>\n\n===Casting===\n{{multiple image|total_width=350\n| direction = horizontal\n| align = left\n| footer = (Left to right) [[Michael Ironside]] and [[Jake Busey]] (both pictured in 2009).

She thought she could convey the character's \"heart\" and vulnerability at being overlooked by Rico because her toughness makes her seem like just another guy.{{sfn|Sammon|1997|pp=47\u201348}}\n\nHarris was mainly known at the time for portraying a child doctor on ''[[Doogie Howser, M.D.]]'' (1989\u20131993), and wanted a project that would shed that image as he moved into his adult career.<ref name=\"SyFyRetro\"/> Describing playing Jenkins, Harris said, \"He's bipolar, in a sense. Almost two completely separate characters. When you first meet [Jenkins]{{nbsp}}... he's Johnny's best friend. A bit geeky, but also funny, with lots of energy and quips{{nbsp}}... when you finally see him again{{nbsp}}... he's worn and pale and has the whole weight of the world on his shoulders. He's also dressed like a [[Gestapo|German Gestapo officer]]!\"{{sfn|Sammon|1997|p=69}} ''Starship Troopers'' was the feature film debut for Patrick Muldoon, who was mostly known for ''Melrose Place''. Muldoon said Verhoeven and Neumeier saw Zander as having a dark side, but he considered him to be an \"ambiguous character{{nbsp}}... he's very competitive, and he gets what he wants. But what we finally ended up with, I think, is actually a slightly tougher version of the relationship between [[Han Solo]] and [[Princess Leia]] in the ''Star Wars'' movies.\"{{sfn|Sammon|1997|p=70}} Busey considered Ace Levy to be an integral part of the cast, who finds the humor in the most macabre situations, releasing the tension for the audience.{{sfn|Sammon|1997|p=78}} Seth Gilliam described his character as \"like the [[Vietnam War|[Vietnam war veteran]]] who kept reenlisting after every tour of duty was over. To my mind, Sugar couldn't deal with being 'back in the world,' as they used to call it.\"{{sfn|Sammon|1997|p=94}}\n\nClancy Brown portrays Sgt. Zim, a \"crusty, macho, jingoistic, ultimately admirable drill instructor.\" Brown based his performance on archetypical \"tough as nails\" instructors from older American films such as ''[[The D.I.]]'' (1957) and ''[[Full Metal Jacket]]'' (1987), as well as taking guidance from retired Marine captain [[Dale Dye]], who said that he should act as if his soldiers are watching every move he makes.{{sfn|Sammon|1997|p=77}} Verhoeven was a fan of Ironside, having attempted to cast him in ''RoboCop'' and giving him a central role in ''[[Total Recall (1990 film)|Total Recall]]'' (1990).<ref name=\"NewYorkerRetro\"/>{{sfn|Sammon|1997|p=66}} His Jean Rasczak character appears early in ''Starship Troopers'' to set the tone, and was an original character combining two characters from the novel: Rico's teacher, Lieutenant Colonel Jean V. Dubois, and Lieutenant Rasczak, a heroic soldier.<ref name=\"CBRRetro\"/>{{sfn|Sammon|1997|p=66}} Ironside said that after the character's family is killed in the destruction of Buenos Aires, \"there isn't a God in Rasczak's life anymore. That makes him a little suicidal.\"{{sfn|Sammon|1997|p=94}}\n\nAbout six main actors, including Van Dien, Meyer, Busey, Gilliam and Curnal Aulisio, as well as twenty-four extras undertook a 12-day boot camp training session under Dale Dye from April 17, 1996, to the first day of filming.{{sfn|Sammon|1997|pp=60\u201361}} Taking place in Hell's Half Acre, the boot camp taught basic combat skills and tactics as Dye perceived they may evolve centuries in the future.{{sfn|Sammon|1997|pp=61, 63}} Activities included a daily {{cvt|3|mile|km}} run and other physical training in the very thin air of the area which was {{cvt|6000|ft|m}} above sea level, how to march, perform maneuveurs, and handle weapons. Those involved slept in open-air military tents, dealing with the harsh conditions including {{cvt|2|ft|m}} of snow and ice following a blizzard, and windstorms, and some people did drop out. Extra Julia Rupkalvis later helped Dye train the hundreds of extras portraying troopers.{{sfn|Sammon|1997|p=63}} As Richards was not in the Infantry cast she did not have to participate, but she chose to anyway, remarking how she, Van Dien, and Busey bonded while huddling together for warmth during the blizzard.<ref name=\"GuardianHowwemade\"/>\n\n===Filming===\n[[Image:HellsHalfAcre.JPG|thumb|right|Badlands of [[Hell's Half Acre (Wyoming)|Hell's Half Acre]], Natrona County, Wyoming, where parts of ''Starship Troopers'' were filmed.]]\nPrincipal photography began on April 29, 1996, with six weeks of filming in Hell's Half Acre.{{sfn|Sammon|1997|pp=53,150}}<ref name=\"ASCMag\"/> The location featured extreme weather, with very warm days followed by frigid evenings that took a toll on much of the on-site equipment, requiring various replacements to be flown in on a regular basis.<ref name=\"ASCMag\"/> The location was also beset by torrential rain, blizzards, and wind storms up to {{cvt|80|mile|km}} per hour.{{sfn|Sammon|1997|p=56}} The site had to be evacuated temporarily after rain mixing with the bentonite in the ground created a slick surface. The crew took as much equipment as they could, and after the rain stopped two weeks later, miles of electrical cables, some equipment, and even cars had been lost under the mud. Even so, only a few days were lost to the weather as a local warehouse had been converted into a soundstage for backup scenes to be filmed.{{sfn|Sammon|1997|p=56}}<ref name=\"ASCMag\"/> Alongside the weather conditions, filming in Hell's Half Acre took its toll on the crew, with respiratory illnesses, exhaustion, and heat stroke from wearing heavy costumes in the {{cvt|115|F|C}}. Dozens of people per day were treated for the ailment, and production had to be shut down for a week at a cost of $1.5{{nbsp}}million a day after it affected Busey.{{sfn|Sammon|1997|p=150}}<ref name=\"CBRRetro\"/><ref name=\"EsquireBusey\"/> The location represented the Klendathu night battle and featured about 1,300 background trooper extras on each night of filming. Scenes were filmed mainly with a [[steadicam]] while handheld footage was occasionally used for battle scenes, inspired by the [[Normandy landings]] in 1944, to make the audience feel a part of the scene. It was designed to be disorienting and gory to set expectations of the film's future combat scenes.{{sfn|Sammon|1997|pp=57,65}}<ref name=\"GuardianHowwemade\"/>\n\nThe cast faced a lot of difficulty in interacting with creatures that were not present in the scene and had to learn how to act against invisible objects. Various methods were used to help including cardboard cutouts and tennis balls or flags on sticks to indicate their position, as well as Verhoeven wielding a broom.<ref name=\"CBRRetro\"/><ref name=\"ASCMag\"/><ref name=\"GuardianHowwemade\"/><ref name=\"LATimesSep1996\"/> A fatal accident occurred during the [[Memorial Day]] holiday weekend in May when some crew, returning to Casper from their vacation at Yellowstone park, were involved in a car crashed caused by an oncoming driver, killing the opposing driver and two crew members, and severely injuring the crew member's girlfriend [[Rachel Campos-Duffy|Rachel Campos]].{{sfn|Sammon|1997|pp=150\u2013151}} Counselling was offered for the remaining cast and crew, who provided donations towards Campos' recover, as did the studio.{{sfn|Sammon|1997|p=151}} Filming moved to Barry Barber Ranch on June 14, for scenes set on Klendathu and Tango Urilla,{{sfn|Sammon|1997|p=150}}<ref name=\"EmpireDutch\"/><ref name=\"ASCMag\"/><ref name=\"StrangeHorizons\"/> before returning to Capser on June 26.{{sfn|Sammon|1997|p=150}} The post Tango Urilla battle celebration was filmed separately at Vasquez Rocks.<ref name=\"StrangeHorizons\"/>\n\nObstacles continued as the crew boarded their return flight to Los Angeles on June 29, to begin filming on sets July 3. One crew member was intoxicated and refused further alcohol by flight attendants and uttered a remark about a bomb which resulted in the plane being evacuated, cargo searched, and all passengers being held in a holding area. The crew member was arrested for violating federal bomb threat laws while the remaining team had to wait another day for a flight, having to travel on a scheduled rest day and losing a day of filming in Los Angeles.{{sfn|Sammon|1997|p=150}} The Buenos Aires educated center classroom and biology lab sets were built on Sony Studios Stage 23 and filmed in late July.{{sfn|Sammon|1997|pp=65,67}} Jenkin's basement set was filmed on Stage 29; it involved a real ferret and features many of Heinlein's books in the background.{{sfn|Sammon|1997|pp=68\u201369}} The jumpball scene was filmed at the [[Walter Pyramid|Long Beach Pyramid]] arena.{{sfn|Sammon|1997|p=69}} Van Dien, Meyer, and Muldoon performed many of their own stunts for the scene apart from flips and somersaults, but otherwise encouraged each other to \"go for it, try to lay me out.\"{{sfn|Sammon|1997|p=70}} The exam results scene and the prom were both filmed at [[Kaiser Permanente]].{{sfn|Sammon|1997|pp=66,70}} The prom scene involved over four hundred extras.{{sfn|Sammon|1997|p=70}} The Federal Recruitment Center scene and the segment where Rico sees off Carmen were filmed over four days at the [[Los Angeles Convention Center]], which Verhoeven chose because he considered its architecture to be futuristic and clean.{{sfn|Sammon|1997|pp=70\u201371}} The scenes there involved the highest number of extras in ''Starship Troopers'', with about 400.{{sfn|Sammon|1997|p=71}} Some minor scenes were also filmed at the [[Park Plaza Hotel (Los Angeles)|Park Plaza Hotel]].{{sfn|Sammon|1997|p=101}}\n\nIt was difficult to find a location for the Camp Currie boot camp scenes until finding [[Mile Square Regional Park]] in [[Fountain Valley, California|Fountain Valley]]. Cameron liked it because it had an abandoned World War II blimp runway onto which they laid a top coat of tarmac and paint for a parade ground. It also fit their image of a low-pollution Earth, being surrounded by flat ground and many trees.{{sfn|Sammon|1997|p=72}} The entire structure was about {{cvt|500|by|300|ft|m}} and included an obstacle course and artillery ranges, as well as involving up to 300 extras.{{sfn|Sammon|1997|p=73}} About six weeks were spent transforming the site, including adding seventeen pre-fabricated buildings.{{sfn|Sammon|1997|p=73}} For the Rico flagellation scene, Teo was trained to use a bullwhip by Armstrong, who himself learned while doubling for [[Harrison Ford]] in the [[Indiana Jones]] film series. The tip of the whip was removed to avoid harm and the camera angle concealed that the whip ended a short distance away from Van Dien.{{sfn|Sammon|1997|p=85}}\n\nThe co-ed nude shower scene was filmed on a set at Sony Pictures and involved about fifteen cast. Verhoeven had them gather around him clothed before clearing the set of all crew but himself and Vacano, after which he told the cast to undress at their own pace.{{sfn|Sammon|1997|p=82}} Although some of the cast admitted to being nervous, they all undressed fairly quickly, but requested that Verhoeven and Vacano also be nude, to which they agreed.{{sfn|Sammon|1997|p=82}}<ref name=\"DigitalSpyat20\"/><ref name=\"EmpireDutch\"/> The scene would become one of ''Starship Troopers''{{'}} most infamous scenes, but Verhoeven remarked he had done a similar scene in ''RoboCop'' although few seemed to notice. For ''Starship Troopers'' he was intent that people would notice. He described the point of the scene as being that since all of the characters are fascists, they have no libido and only talk about their careers and combat.<ref name=\"EmpireDutch\"/> A separate nude scene was written for Richards but she refused to take part as she did not see the purpose.<ref name=\"GuardianHowwemade\"/>\n\nArmstrong filmed many of the film's action sequences as well as the complex stunts and special effect sequences that would be too consuming for the first unit. Also working as the stunt director, Armstrong delegated much of the first unit stunt work to Dickey Beer to avoid overworking himself.{{sfn|Sammon|1997|pp=58\u201360}} The fight between Rico and Zander was mainly performed by their actors while wearing padding suits.{{sfn|Sammon|1997|p=90}} Van Dien was injured during a stunt that involved him riding on the back of a gigantic, moving, fiberglass \"Tanker Bug\" shell. The movement kept slamming him into the shell as he was held in place with ropes, chipping one of his teeth and bruising his ribs over the {{frac|3|1|2}} days of filming, but he refused to mention the pain and interrupt filming.<ref name=\"LATimesSep1996\"/> One of the more dangerous stunts came near the end of filming, involving Van Dien, Busey, and Richards running out of an Arachnid tunnel followed by a real explosion. Only one take was done, and they were told that if someone tripped to pick them up and keep moving.<ref name=\"GuardianHowwemade\"/>\n\nDespite the difficult conditions and obstacles, principal photography concluded after six months of filming generally six days a week on October 16, 1996, not longer after the intended finishing date.{{sfn|Sammon|1997|pp=99\u2013100, 123}} Second unit filming concluded a week later on October 23, after filming various explosions and background scenery.{{sfn|Sammon|1997|p=99}} Armstrong estimated that about 40% of ''Starship Troopers'' constituted second unit-filmed scenes.{{sfn|Sammon|1997|p=100}} Most effects scenes shot early in the schedule so there was sufficient time for the effecs team to complete their work.{{sfn|Sammon|1997|p=123}}\n\n===Post-production===\nPost-production began in late October 1996, and concluded about August 1997, covering editing, music, and effects.{{sfn|Sammon|1997|pp=100,128}} ''Starship Troopers'' was edited by [[Mark Goldblatt]] with co-editor Caroline Ross.{{sfn|Sammon|1997|pp=122\u2013123}} Goldblatt described Verhoeven as very collaborative, allowing them to interpret his footage in their own way and even allowing them input during filming on how special effects may be staged. Even so, he said Verhoeven was conservative with what he filmed and generally only captured what he wanted with no coverage footage.{{sfn|Sammon|1997|p=123}} Some scenes were changed for the release, including trimming the scene of the Brain Bug sucking brains. Another scene, of Carmen kissing Rico at the end was cut because [[test audience]]s thought it was \"immoral\" after Zander's death, and were unconvinced that a woman could love both men simultaneously. The audiences were also unhappy with the Carmen character choosing her career over her relationship with Rico and wanted her to die at the end instead of Dizzy.<ref name=\"CBRRetro\"/>\n\nSeveral scenes were also filmed during this period, including some of the FedNet propaganda sequences as there was no time to complete these during principal photography. Filmed over a week in late January 1997, with many of the same crew including Verhoeven and Vacano, mainly on location in and around Los Angeles, these sequences included survivors digging through the remains of Buenos Aires, shot on a vacant lot in downtown Los Angeles that was dressed with broken concrete and flame effects. Some of the crew stood in for the cast including Davison, Neumeier, Stacy Lumbrezer, and Paul Sammon, author of the film's \"Making Of\" book. Another scene of a psychic with a third eye was filmed in a Delta Airlines hangar at the Los Angeles International Airport.{{sfn|Sammon|1997|p=101}} ''Starship Troopers'' is reported to have a final budget of $100\u2013$110{{nbsp}}million.<ref name=\"NYTimesNov1097\"/><ref name=\"LATimesSep1996\"/><ref name=\"SyFyRetro\"/>{{efn|The 1997 production budget of $100\u2013$110{{nbsp}}million is equivalent to ${{Format price|{{Inflation|US|100000000|1997}}}}\u2013${{Format price|{{Inflation|US|110000000|1997}}}} in {{Inflation/year|US}}.}}\n\nTwo [[rough cut]] screenings were held on May 29 and 30, 1997, for executives and the reaction was positive with discussions of a sequel.{{sfn|Sammon|1997|pp=131\u2013132}} Discussing the long development of ''Starship Troopers'', Marshall said that he was proud of it whether it was a success or not, but would be happiest if audiences appreciated the work that had gone into it.

Illusion.{{sfn|Sammon|1997|pp=104, 111, 114, 117}}<ref name=\"ASCMag\"/> Toward the end of production, visual effects supervisor Laura Buff recommended visual effects artist, [[Scott E.

Club'' wrote that ''Starship Troopers'' presents a society that has been convinced to trade its freedoms, rights, and identities for security from an alien threat.<ref name=\"AVClubBestof1990s\"/>\n\n''Starship Troopers'' was also Verhoeven's response to events he perceived in contemporary U.S. politics, such as limited gun restrictions and an increase of capital punishment, which he believed could eventually result in open fascism, as well as films that glorified U.S. military forces and depicted a casual attitude to violence.{{efn|Attributed to multiple references:<ref name=\"DOGVerhoevenInt\"/><ref name=\"ScreenRantRetro\"/><ref name=\"GuardianHowwemade\"/><ref name=\"BestSciFiPaste\"/><ref name=\"DOGAds\"/>}} ''Entertainment Weekly'' found similarities between ''Starship Troopers'' and the action film ''[[Top Gun]]'' (1986), which follows physically strong, young, and attractive United States Navy pilots combating a vague enemy. Several action films from the 1990s, such as ''[[Independence Day (1996 film)|Independence Day]]'' (1996) and ''[[Air Force One (film)|Air Force One]]'' (1997), also offered a similar American jingoism and pro-military message, with both films featuring a U.S. president character who is able to take an active role in the action because of their military backgrounds.<ref name=\"EWShowerScene\"/>\n\n===Citizenship and violence===\nIn the militaristic society depicted in ''Starship Troopers'', many rights are reserved only for citizens, those who have served in the military, and restricted to ordinary civilians.<ref name=\"EWShowerScene\"/><ref name=\"TheVergeRetro\"/> The boot camp shower scene involves several characters discussing their reason for enlistment, such as being able to serve as a politician, have children, receive a scholarship, or just not having to work on a farm.{{sfn|Sammon|1997|p=78}}<ref name=\"EWShowerScene\"/> Such options, typical of everyone within a democracy, are restricted by the military government governing Earth, because they must be earned through military service and thus through violence and force.<ref name=\"EWShowerScene\"/> Even voting is presented as an act of force, of supreme authority, a right that must be taken instead of given.<ref name=\"EWShowerScene\"/><ref name=\"TheVergeRetro\"/> As Rasczak tells his students, \"violence has resolved more conflicts than anything else. The contrary opinion that violence doesn't solve anything is merely wishful thinking at worst.\"<ref name=\"AVClubDecade\"/> The nudity in the shower scene was criticized, but Verhoeven believed such criticism was hypocritical, believing it was easier to depict extreme violence in American films without censorship than nudity. He wanted to convey that despite their nudity, the characters do not comment or react to the fact, implying that their libido was suppressed by their dedication to fascism, the war, and their careers.<ref name=\"EmpireDutch\"/>\n\nAlthough humanity is mainly presented as victims of the Arachnid threat, aspects of ''Starship Troopers'' reveal that humanity may have instigated the conflict by invading Arachnid worlds, and the creatures are defending themselves.<ref name=\"TheAtlanticMisunderstood\"/><ref name=\"SalonORourke\"/><ref name=\"CBRRetro\"/>  The Arachnid's asteroid that strikes Earth is used to justify a full-scale war.<ref name=\"SalonORourke\"/><ref name=\"CBRRetro\"/> This presents a cycle of war, in which Earth's youths are emboldened by the propaganda slogans to become readily disposable infantry.<ref name=\"TheAtlanticMisunderstood\"/>\n\nThese soldiers' only orders are to kill anything inhuman, and strategic failures are solved by using more soldiers.<ref name=\"ColliderRetro\"/> Writer, Lloyd Farley, considered the gory and explicit scenes depicting the dead were intended to overtly display the \"horrors of war\" in a society solely dedicated to conflict.<ref name=\"ColliderRetro\"/> The countless soldier deaths on Planet P are quickly forgotten as troops celebrate their victory and capture of the Brain Bug, with the potential promise this will lead to the end of the war, but no actual conclusion is offered in ''Starship Troopers''.<ref name=\"CBRRetro\"/><ref name=\"CBRFascism\"/> This violence is reinforced with rewards, such as Rico's repeated promotions, but these openings often arise because his predecessor was killed.<ref name=\"AVClub2010\"/><ref name=\"CBRFascism\"/> ''Starship Troopers'' culminates with the surviving protagonists not disagreeing with this system or choosing to fight against it, but becoming a part of it by appearing in recruitment propaganda to enlist the next generation of troops.<ref name=\"ColliderRetro\"/><ref name=\"CBRRetro\"/><ref name=\"TheAtlanticMisunderstood\"/>\n\n==Legacy==\n=== Critical reassessment ===\nDespite its initial negative reception, ''Starship Troopers'' has been re-evaluated and is now considered one of the best science fiction films ever made.{{efn|Attributed to multiple references:<ref name=\"BestSciFiIGN\"/><ref name=\"BestSciFiPaste\"/><ref name=\"BestSciFiRT\"/><ref name=\"BestSciFiThrillist\"/><ref name=\"TheAtlanticMisunderstood\"/>}} The film has grown in esteem in the decades since its release, with retrospective analyses describing it as among the most subversive and misunderstood Hollywood studio films ever made, undermined by critics and audiences who misinterpreted the anti-fascist satire as an \"endorsement of a fascist utopia.\"{{efn|Attributed to multiple references:<ref name=\"AVClubDecade\"/><ref name=\"ScreenRantAds\"/><ref name=\"TheAtlanticMisunderstood\"/><ref name=\"AVClub2010\"/><ref name=\"EscapistRetro\"/><ref name=\"CBRRetro\"/><ref name=\"SyFyRetro\"/><ref name=\"ScreenRant90s\"/><ref name=\"AVClub90s\"/>}} ''[[The Verge]]'' and ''[[The Atlantic]]'' described it as an obvious satire, in hindsight, that was released at the wrong time, amid an era of prosperity in the United States during the late 1990s when American audiences may not have seen, or wanted to see, the criticisms of their own society. The marketing was also blamed, which presented ''Starship Troopers'' as a typical science fiction action film, making it easy for audiences not expecting satire to misinterpret it.<ref name=\"TheAtlanticMisunderstood\"/><ref name=\"TheVergeRetro\"/> Other publications argued that ''Starship Troopers'' was an example of [[Poe's law]], where views are presented to such an extreme that it becomes impossible for audiences to understand if it is parody or serious.<ref name=\"EscapistRetro\"/><ref name=\"SyFyRetro\"/>\n\nOpinions on the film gradually changed alongside societal shifts, making the satire more obvious, particularly in the 2010s as its critiques of right-wing militarism, the [[military\u2013industrial complex]], reactionary violence, and American jingoism, made it seem ahead of its time.{{efn|Attributed to multiple references:<ref name=\"TheAtlanticMisunderstood\"/><ref name=\"TheVergeRetro\"/><ref name=\"EscapistRetro\"/>}} In a 2020 retrospective, for ''[[The New Yorker]]'', David Roth argued that ''Starship Troopers''{{'}} message had become more meaningful because it presents a narrative in which humanity, built on a culture of fascism and violence, \"gets its ass kicked,\" and its only solution is to inflict more violence, to little success. Roth further contrasted the culture of violence to contemporary police brutality against peaceful protests or government attempts to defeat the [[COVID-19 pandemic]] through will.<ref name=\"TheVergeRetro\"/> [[Syfy]] said it remained \"riveting,\" but was undermined by poor acting (even if that was intended) and melodrama.<ref name=\"SyFyRetro\"/>\n\nAlongside being looked on more favorably by critics, ''Starship Troopers'' is also considered a [[Cult following|cult classic]] and \"unsung masterpiece.\"{{efn|Attributed to multiple references:<ref name=\"NewYorkerRetro\"/><ref name=\"SlashFilmSequels\"/><ref name=\"SyFyRetro\"/><ref name=\"ScreenRantRetro\"/><ref name=\"TheAtlanticMisunderstood\"/>}} ''[[Empire (film magazine)|Empire]]'' called it the true spiritual successor to ''RoboCop''{{'}}s \"savage satire\" and \"gonzo violence,\" unlike that film's own sequels.<ref name=\"ActionEmpire2016\"/> ''Starship Troopers'' is now considered one of the best films of the 1990s.{{efn|Attributed to multiple references:<ref name=\"TheAtlanticMisunderstood\"/><ref name=\"AVClub90s\"/><ref name=\"AVClubBestof1990s\"/><ref name=\"Bestof90sRollingStone\"/><ref name=\"Bestof90sSlant\"/><ref name=\"Bestof90sTimeout\"/><ref name=\"Bestof90sIndieWire\"/>}} In 2021, the [[British Film Institute]] named it one of the 10 greatest science fiction adaptations.<ref name=\"BFIGreatAdapt\"/> Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes offers a {{RT data|score}} approval rating from the aggregated reviews of {{RT data|count}} critics, with an average score of {{RT data|average}}. The website's critical consensus reads, \"A fun movie...if you can accept the excessive gore and wooden acting.\"<ref name=\"RottenTomatoes\"/> The film has a score of 51 out of 100 on [[Metacritic]] based on 20 critics' reviews, indicating \"mixed or average reviews.\"<ref name=\"Metacritic\"/>\n\n===Cultural influence===\n''Starship Troopers'' has continued to generate interest in the decades since its release, in part because of its critical reassessment, but also because of its elements which came to reflect future events such as [[September 11 attacks|September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks]] and the subsequent actions of the U.S. government and president [[George W. Bush]] to convince the American people to surrender certain liberties to enable a war and defeat their enemies.<ref name=\"SyFyRetro\"/><ref name=\"AVClub2010\"/> Retrospectives in the late 2010s and early 2020s have described how a contemporary rise in fascist activity in the U.S. had made ''Starship Troopers'' seem prescient and more of a warning than satire.<ref name=\"SyFyRetro\"/><ref name=\"ColliderRetro\"/><ref name=\"DOGVerhoevenInt\"/> ''The A.V. Club'' described ''Starship Troopers'' as a \"brilliant dissection\" of wars and how propaganda is used to justify young people being set to their deaths against a dehumanized enemy.<ref name=\"AVClub2010\"/><ref name=\"ColliderRetro\"/>\n\nVerhoeven followed ''Starship Troopers'' with the 2000 science fiction horror ''[[Hollow Man]]'', a film that he believed lacked his own personal style as he acquiesced to studio demands. Disillusioned with the [[Hollywood studio system]], and compounded by the failures of ''Showgirls'' and ''Starship Troopers'', Verhoeven returned to Europe to work outside of the Hollywood film system, going on to earn acclaim for his subsequent works such as ''[[Black Book (film)|Black Book]]'' (2006) and ''[[Elle (film)|Elle]]'' (2016).<ref name=\"SyFyRetro\"/> In 2015, Van Dien remarked \"there has not been a week in my life since I did [''Starship Troopers''] where I can go down the street without someone going 'Rico!'\"<ref name=\"SyFyRetro\"/> Richards has said she loved her character and how people responded to her as a strong female.<ref name=\"GuardianHowwemade\"/>\n\nSeveral filmmakers have named it as an influence or among their favorite films, including [[Ari Aster]], [[Margaret Brown (film director)|Margaret Brown]], [[Macaulay Culkin]],<ref name=\"VultureCulkin\"/> [[David Lowery (director)|David Lowery]], [[Robert Rodriguez]], [[Eli Roth]], [[Riley Stearns]], [[Quentin Tarantino]], [[James Wan]], and [[Edgar Wright]].<ref name=\"IndieWire90sPros\"/><ref name=\"Inverse2021TVSeries\"/> A 2020 retrospective by ''[[The Guardian]]'' suggested that, with hindsight, ''Starship Troopers'' formed the final instalment of Verhoeven's unofficial science fiction action film trilogy about authoritarian governance, preceded by ''RoboCop'' (1987) and ''Total Recall'' (1990).<ref name=\"TheGuardianREtro\"/> Slogans used in the film, such as \"I'm doing my part!\", and \"Would you like to know more?\" have since become part of the cultural lexicon.<ref name=\"SyFyRetro\"/>\n\n== Sequels and remake ==\n{{main|Starship Troopers (franchise)}}\nVerhoeven had never developed a sequel to any of his films, but he was interested in directing a sequel to ''Starship Troopers'', depending on its performance, although he said \"I would need another three or four years of thinking to make sure the movie doesn't repeat itself.\"<ref name=\"NYTimesNov1097\"/> The relative failure of ''Starship Troopers'' derailed plans for a theatrical sequel and Verhoeven moved on to other projects.<ref name=\"SyFyRetro\"/> Even so, ''Starship Troopers'' was followed by two low-budget, direct-to-home media sequels. The first, ''[[Starship Troopers 2: Hero of the Federation]]'' (2004), was directed by Tippett from a script by Neumeier and featured no returning cast or characters. Neumeier wrote and directed the second sequel, ''[[Starship Troopers 3: Marauder]]'' (2008), which brought back Van Dien as an older Rico.<ref name=\"SlashFilmSequels\" /><ref name=\"SyFyRetro\"/> The series narrative was continued in two CGI animated films: ''[[Starship Troopers: Invasion]]'' (2012) sees the return of Rico, Jenkins, and Ibanez (with different voice actors), while ''[[Starship Troopers: Traitor of Mars]]'' (2017) was written by Neumeier and features voice acting by Van Dien and Meyer.<ref name=\"SyFyRetro\"/><ref name=\"THRTraitor\"/><ref name=\"IGNInvasion\"/>\n\nBeginning in 2011, reports suggested that producer [[Neal H.
