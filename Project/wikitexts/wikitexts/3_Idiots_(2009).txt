Rancho's carefree approach to education results in him being at odds with the college's director, Dr. Viru Sahastrabuddhe (nicknamed \"Virus\" by the students), who believes in a strict and competitive education system.\n\nWhen a student named Joy Lobo commits suicide after failing to meet a project deadline, Rancho confronts Virus about the extreme pressure placed on ICE students but is rudely rebuffed. One night, the trio gatecrash a wedding and meet Virus' youngest daughter, Pia, only later realizing that the wedding is for Pia's older sister, Mona. An infuriated Virus warns Farhan and Raju about the effects of them being friends with Rancho by pointing out the modest financial situations of their families, scaring Raju into bunking with Chatur \"Silencer\" Ramalingam, a competitive, arrogant student who believes in learning by rote memorization. To teach Chatur a lesson about memorization, Rancho and Farhan make obscene modifications in Chatur's teacher's day speech by changing certain words (like ''Chamatkar'' (Miracle) to ''Balatkar'' (Screw) and ''Dhan'' (Money) to ''Stan'' (Bosom)), leading to a furious Chatur to make a bet with Rancho to see who will be more successful in 10 years.\n\nThe night before their final exams, Raju's [[Paralysis|paralyzed]] father experiences a medical emergency and Rancho rushes him to the hospital on Pia's scooter with her help. After realizing that Rancho saved his father's life, Raju reconciles with him. At the end of the year, Rancho comes first in the class, while Farhan and Raju are last and second last, respectively. At the yearly class photo, Rancho makes a bet with Virus that if either Raju or Farhan gets a job from on-campus interviews, Virus will shave his mustache.\n\nOne night in their fourth year of college, Rancho tells his friends why they consistently place last: Farhan's passion is photography, not engineering, and Raju lacks self-confidence. After Farhan and Raju promise to confront their problems if Rancho confesses his feelings for Pia, the three of them drunkenly break into Virus' house. Virus spots Raju during their escape and, the next day gives him an ultimatum: to incriminate his friends or be expelled himself. A distraught Raju attempts suicide, but survives and recovers due to support and care from his friends and family, also leading to Virus revoking the expulsion. Raju is successful in a job interview, while Farhan convinces his father to let him become a photographer.\n\nVirus, in an attempt to protect his fragile ego, tries to sabotage Raju's chances of success by holding an unfairly difficult exam. With Pia's help, Rancho and Farhan break into Virus' office and steal the exam paper. Even though Raju refuses to cheat, the three of them are caught and expelled. Pia confronts her father over her brother's suicide, which was prompted by similar pressure placed on him by Virus. That night, during a heavy rainstorm, Mona, who is pregnant, goes into labor. Unable to drive to a hospital, Rancho modifies a vacuum cleaner into a [[ventouse]] and delivers the baby with the help of Pia, Farhan, and Raju. A grateful Virus acknowledges Rancho by giving him a valuable [[Space Pen|space pen]] and revokes the trio's expulsions. On graduation day, Rancho suddenly disappears.\n\n10 years later, Chatur, now the vice president at a reputable company, calls Farhan and Raju to remind them of the bet he made with Rancho about who would be more successful. The three of them set out to find Rancho. Upon reaching [[Shimla]], where Chatur has located Rancho's house, they come across a different man named Ranchhoddas Shyamaldas Chanchad. He explains that the \"Rancho\" at ICE was his family's gardener's son, who was incredibly intelligent and gifted. Ranchhoddas' father tasked Rancho with completing Ranchoddas' academics but told him to cut all contact with anyone at ICE after finishing college. Rancho, who was more interested in learning than getting a degree, agreed but said that two idiots would come looking for him one day. Ranchoddas gives them Rancho\u2019s address in [[Ladakh]].\n\nOn the way there, Farhan and Raju gatecrash Pia's wedding to her materialistic boyfriend Suhas in [[Manali, Himachal Pradesh|Manali]] and convince her to come with them to find Rancho. At the address in Ladakh, the group is astonished to find a thriving school and Millimeter, an errand boy at ICE whom Rancho has now made his assistant. They reunite with Rancho on a [[Shoal|sandbar]] and Rancho admits he is still in love with Pia who shares a kiss with him. Chatur assumes that Rancho is a schoolteacher and mocks him, but Rancho reveals himself to be Phunsukh Wangdu, a successful scientist and inventor that Chatur's company is interested in. A flabbergasted Chatur accepts defeat as the rest of the group run away from him laughing.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Aamir Khan]] as Ranchhoddas \"Rancho\" Shyamaldas Chanchad / Phunsukh Wangdu\n* [[R.

However, it was the pirate market that introduced ''3 Idiots'' to most Chinese audiences, becoming a [[cult film]] in the country among youths. Aamir Khan gained a large growing Chinese fanbase as a result. By 2013, China grew to become the world's second-largest film market (after the United States), paving the way for Aamir Khan's Chinese box office success, with ''[[Dhoom 3]]'' (2013), ''[[PK (film)|PK]]'' (2014), ''[[Dangal (film)|Dangal]]'' (2016) and ''[[Secret Superstar]]'' (2017).<ref name=\"forbes2\">{{cite news |last1=Cain |first1=Rob |title=How A 52-Year-Old Indian Actor Became China's Favorite Movie Star |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/robcain/2017/06/08/how-a-52-year-old-indian-actor-became-chinas-favorite-movie-star/?sh=4b6fae02516e |access-date=29 April 2022 |work=Forbes |date=8 June 2017 |language=en}}</ref> In 2011, a documentary film titled ''Big in Bollywood'' was released, which revolves about [[Omi Vaidya]]'s journey from a struggling [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] actor to a successful Bollywood breakthrough with this film.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Heymont |first=George |date=1 December 2011 |title=Big in Bollywood (That's What Friends Are For) |work=[[HuffPost]] |url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/george-heymont/big-in-bollywood-movie_b_1122412.html |access-date=22 October 2021}}</ref>\n\nAs of 2017, ''3 Idiots'' has been ranked China's 12th favourite film of all time according to ratings on popular Chinese film review site [[Douban]], with only one domestic [[Chinese film]] (''[[Farewell My Concubine (film)|Farewell My Concubine]]'') ranked higher.<ref name=\"forbes2\" /><ref name=\"theworldofchinese\">{{Cite web |date=19 May 2017 |title=China's Favorite Movies |url=http://www.theworldofchinese.com/2017/05/chinas-favorite-movies/ |website=[[The World of Chinese]]}}</ref> The film holds an average rating of 9.2 on Douban,<ref name=\"theworldofchinese\" /> with over 1.15&nbsp;million votes.<ref>{{Cite web |title=\u4e09\u50bb\u5927\u95f9\u5b9d\u83b1\u575e (\u8c46\u74e3) |url=https://movie.douban.com/subject/3793023/ |access-date=9 December 2017 |website=[[Douban]] |language=zh-cmn-Hans}}</ref> As of 2021, the film is ranked at No. 14 on the list with mostly youth voting.
