It also features [[Randolph Scott]], [[Harriet Nelson|Harriet Hilliard]], and [[Astrid Allwyn]], with music and lyrics by [[Irving Berlin]]. [[Lucille Ball]] and [[Betty Grable]] also appear, in supporting roles. The film was directed by [[Mark Sandrich]] with script by [[Allan Scott (American screenwriter)|Allan Scott]] and [[Dwight Taylor (writer)|Dwight Taylor]] based on the 1922 play ''Shore Leave'' by [[Hubert Osborne]].\n\n''Follow the Fleet'' was extremely successful<ref>Croce: \"with all its flaws ''Follow the Fleet'' was a shattering hit\", p.84</ref> at the box office, and during 1936, Astaire's recorded versions of \"[[Let Yourself Go (Irving Berlin song)|Let Yourself Go]]\", \"[[I'm Putting all My Eggs in One Basket]]\", and \"[[Let's Face the Music and Dance]]\" reached their highest positions<ref>Mueller p.412</ref> of 3rd, 2nd, 3rd respectively in the US Hit Parade. Harriet Hilliard and Tony Martin made their screen debuts in this film. RKO borrowed Randolph Scott from Paramount and Astrid Allwyn from Fox for the production.<ref>[http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title.jsp?stid=2785&category=Notes TCM.com]</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nSeaman \"Bake\" Baker and Sherry are former dance partners, now separated, with Baker in the Navy and Sherry working as a dance hostess in a San Francisco ballroom, ''Paradise''.\n\nBake visits the ballroom with his Navy buddy \"Bilge\" during a period of [[w:Shore leave|liberty]], reuniting with Sherry (but costing her job), while Bilge is initially attracted to Sherry's sister Connie. When Connie begins to talk about marriage, Bilge quickly diverts his attention towards a friend of Sherry's, Iris, a divorced socialite.\n\nThe sailors return to sea while Connie seeks to raise money to salvage her deceased sea-captain father's sailing ship. When the boys return to San Francisco, Bake attempts to get Sherry a job in a [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] show, but fails amidst a flurry of mistaken identities and misunderstandings. He redeems himself by staging a benefit show which raises the final seven hundred dollars needed to refurbish the ship \u2013 although he has to jump ship in order to do so. Bilge, now a [[Chief Petty Officer]], is ordered to locate and arrest him, but allows Bake to complete the show.\n\nAfter the concert, Bake and Sherry are offered a show on Broadway, which [[Desertion|A.W.O.L.]] Bake accepts on the proviso that Sherry asks him to marry her. Of course, he first has to be sent to the [[Military prison#Brig|brig]] and take his punishment.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Fred Astaire]] as Bake Baker \n* [[Ginger Rogers]] as Sherry Martin \n* [[Randolph Scott]] as Bilge Smith \n* [[Harriet Hilliard]] as Connie Martin\n* [[Astrid Allwyn]] as Mrs. Iris Manning \n* [[Betty Grable]] as trio singer \n* [[Harry Beresford]] as Captain Hickey \n* [[Russell Hicks (actor)|Russell Hicks]] as Nolan \n* [[Brooks Benedict]] as David Sullivan \n* Ray Mayer as Dopey Williams \n\n* [[Lucille Ball]] as Kitty Collins\n* [[Tony Martin (entertainer)|Tony Martin]] as sailor\n* [[Jane Hamilton (actress)|Jane Hamilton]] as Paradise Ballroom waitress \n* [[Doris Lloyd]] as Mrs. Courtney\n* [[Humphrey Bogart]] as sailor\n{{Div col end}}\n\n'''Cast notes:'''\n*Singer [[Harriet Hilliard]] was later well known as the wife of [[Ozzie Nelson]] and the mother of [[Ricky Nelson|Ricky]] and [[David Nelson (actor)|David]] Nelson, who all portrayed themselves on the TV series ''[[The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet]]''.\n\n==Musical numbers==\n[[Hermes Pan (choreographer)|Hermes Pan]] collaborated with Astaire on the choreography. Two songs, \"Moonlight Maneuvers\" and \"With a Smile on My Face\" were written for the film but unused.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}\n\n* \"[[We Saw The Sea]]\": The film  introduces Astaire with this song.<ref>A separate recording exists of Irving Berlin singing this song to his own piano accompaniment, a recording which was featured by Astaire's choreography partner Hermes Pan and rehearsal pianist [[Hal Borne]] in the 2004 [[Arte|ARTE]] documentary ''l'Art de Fred Astaire''.</ref>\n* \"[[Let Yourself Go (Irving Berlin song)|Let Yourself Go]]\": Backed by a trio which includes Betty Grable, a nautically-attired Rogers sings this Berlin [[Great American Songbook|standard]], which is followed, after an interlude (which includes the 'Get Thee Behind Me' song from Harriet Hilliard), by a comic tap duet with Astaire. This routine begins as a competitive challenge between Astaire-Rogers and another couple (Bob Cromer and Dorothy Fleischman, who soon withdraw) and develops into an energetic duet with much emphasis on galloping kicks, leg wiggling and scampering moves.<ref>Mueller p.92</ref>\n* \"[[Get Thee Behind Me Satan]]\": Sung by Harriet Hilliard, this number was originally intended for Rogers in ''[[Top Hat]]''. \n* \"I'd Rather Lead A Band\": After singing this number Astaire embarks on a tap solo in which he dances on, off and around the beat \u2013 an ability for which he had long been famous in theatre. After leading the band in the song, he discards the baton and begins the solo part of his routine. After this, he is joined by a chorus of sailors who are alternately led and challenged by him.\n* \"Let Yourself Go\" (solo dance): This is Ginger Rogers' only solo tap dance in her ten films with Astaire.\n* \"But Where Are You?\": Sung by Harriet Hilliard.\n* \"[[I'm Putting All My Eggs in One Basket]]\": As in the \"[[I Won't Dance]]\" number from ''[[Roberta (1935 film)|Roberta]]'', the song is preceded by a solo piano display by Astaire \u2013 a playing style he termed his \"feelthy piano\". Then Astaire and Rogers sing alternate choruses before embarking on a comic dance duet which plays on the notion of both dancers being unable to keep in step with each other. Incidentally, [[Lucille Ball]] appears just before this number to put a sailor admirer down with the line \"Tell me little boy, did you get a whistle or a baseball bat with that suit?\"\n* \"[[Let's Face the Music and Dance]]\": Astaire sings this to Rogers after which the dance begins slowly and culminates in a static exit pose. The dance is filmed in one continuous shot lasting two minutes and fifty seconds. During the first take, Rogers's dress, which was heavily weighted so as to achieve a controlled swirling action, hit Astaire in the face<ref>Astaire: \"I got the flying sleeve smack on the jaw and partly in the eye\", p.220</ref> midway through the routine, though the effect is barely discernible. He nonetheless selected<ref>Astaire: \"The No. 1 take was perfect. It was the one we all liked best.\", p.220</ref> this take out of twenty overall for the final picture. The set \u2013 designed by [[Carroll Clark]] under the direction of [[Van Nest Polglase]] \u2013 is frequently cited as a leading example of [[Art Deco]]-influenced [[art direction]] known as [[Hollywood Moderne]]. Film clips of this routine were featured in the 1981 film ''[[Pennies from Heaven (1981 film)|Pennies from Heaven]]'' \u2013 detested by Astaire,<ref>Satchell, p.251:\"I have never spent two more miserable hours in my life. Every scene was cheap and vulgar. They don't realise that the thirties were a very innocent age, and that should have been set in the eighties \u2014 it was just froth; it makes you cry it's so distasteful.\"</ref> \u2013 where it was also reinterpreted by [[Steve Martin]] and [[Bernadette Peters]] with revised choreography by [[Danny Daniels]].\n\n==Reception==\nContemporary reviews were positive. \"Even though it is not the best of (Astaire and Rogers') series it still is good enough to take the head of this year's class in song and dance entertainment\", wrote [[Frank Nugent|Frank S. Nugent]] in ''[[The New York Times]]''. \"They tap as gayly, waltz as beautifully and disagree as merrily as ever.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9403EEDC1730E13BBC4951DFB466838D629EDE |title=Movie Review \u2013 Follow the Fleet |last=Nugent |first=Frank S. |author-link=Frank Nugent |date=February 21, 1936 |website=[[The New York Times]]  |access-date=August 14, 2015 }}</ref> \"With Ginger Rogers once again opposite, and the Irving Berlin music to dance to and sing, Astaire once more legs himself and his picture into the big time entertainment class\", ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' wrote in a positive review, although it found the 110 minute running time \"way overboard\" and suggested it could have benefited from being cut by 20 minutes.<ref>{{cite news |date=February 26, 1936 |title=Follow the Fleet |journal=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |location=New York |page=15 }}</ref> \"Well loaded with entertainment for mass satisfaction\", reported ''[[Film Daily]]''.<ref>{{cite news |date=February 19, 1936 |title=Reviews of the New Films |journal=[[Film Daily]] |location=New York |page=4 }}</ref> [[John Mosher (writer)|John Mosher]] of ''[[The New Yorker]]'' wrote that \"Fred Astaire bobs at his best ...

Comparing the acting of Astaire to the animated character [[Mickey Mouse]], Greene suggests that the two are alike in \"break[ing] the laws of nature\". However, Greene draws the line at comparing Ginger Rogers to [[Minnie Mouse|Minnie]]. Greene also denounced the [[bleep censor]]ship introduced by the [[British Board of Film Censors]] in removing the word \"Satan\" from the Hilliard song, \"[[Get Thee Behind Me Satan]]\".<ref>{{cite journal |last= Greene|first= Graham|author-link= Graham Greene|date= 24 April 1936|title= Follow the Fleet/The Peace Film|journal= [[The Spectator]]}} (reprinted in: {{cite book|editor-last= Taylor|editor-first= John Russell|editor-link= John Russell Taylor|date= 1980|title= The Pleasure Dome|url= https://archive.org/details/pleasuredomegrah00gree/page/67|pages= [https://archive.org/details/pleasuredomegrah00gree/page/67 67\u201369]|isbn= 0192812866|url-access= registration}})</ref>\n\nDance commentators [[Arlene Croce]] and [[John Mueller]] point out that, aside from the obvious weakness,<ref>Croce: \"its plot is a dead weight\", p. 82; Mueller: \"bogged down by a sour, labored plot\", p. 89</ref> a discursive and overlong plot lacking quality specialist comedians,<ref>Mueller p. 90</ref> the film contains some of the Astaire-Rogers partnership's most prized duets, not least the iconic \"[[Let's Face the Music and Dance]]\". According to [[Arlene Croce]]: \"One reason the numbers in ''Follow the Fleet'' are as great as they are is that Rogers had improved remarkably as a dancer. Under Astaire's coaching she had developed extraordinary range, and the numbers in the film are designed to show it off.\"<ref>Croce, p. 82</ref> That this film's remarkable score <ref>Astaire: \"one of his best\" p. 218</ref> was produced immediately after his smash-hit score for ''[[Top Hat]]'' is perhaps testimony to Berlin's claim that Astaire's abilities inspired him to deliver some of his finest work.<ref>Mueller p. 78</ref> As an actor, however, Astaire makes an  unconvincing<ref>Mueller: \"no one is taken in\", p. 89</ref> attempt at shedding the wealthy man-about-town image by donning a sailor's uniform, while Rogers, in this her fifth pairing with Astaire, brings her usual comedic and dramatic flair to bear on her role as a nightclub entertainer.\n\nThe film is recognized by [[American Film Institute]] in these lists:\n* 2006: [[AFI's Greatest Movie Musicals]] \u2013 Nominated<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.afi.com/Docs/100Years/musicals_ballot.pdf |title= AFI's Greatest Movie Musicals Nominees |access-date=2016-08-13}}</ref>\n\n==Box office==\nThe film earned $1,532,000 in the US and Canada and $1,175,000 elsewhere making a profit of $945,000.
