Loosely based on the [[The Birds (story)|1952 short story of the same name]] by [[Daphne du Maurier]], it focuses on a series of sudden and unexplained violent bird attacks on the people of [[Bodega Bay, California]], over the course of a few days.\n\nThe film stars [[Rod Taylor]] and [[Tippi Hedren]] in her screen debut, alongside [[Jessica Tandy]], [[Suzanne Pleshette]], and [[Veronica Cartwright]]. The screenplay is by [[Evan Hunter]], who was told by Hitchcock to develop new characters and a more elaborate plot while keeping du Maurier's title and concept of unexplained bird attacks.\n\nAt the [[36th Academy Awards]], [[Ub Iwerks]] was nominated for [[Academy Award for Best Visual Effects|Best Special Effects]] for his work on the film.  The award, however, went to the only other nominee,  [[Emil Kosa Jr.]] for ''[[Cleopatra (1963 film)|Cleopatra]]''.\n\nIn 2016, ''The Birds'' was deemed \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\" by the United States [[Library of Congress]], and selected for preservation in its [[National Film Registry]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Complete National Film Registry Listing |url=https://www.loc.gov/programs/national-film-preservation-board/film-registry/complete-national-film-registry-listing/|access-date=2020-09-17|website=Library of Congress}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=With \"20,000 Leagues\", the National Film Registry Reaches 700|url=https://www.loc.gov/item/prn-16-209/with-20000-leagues-the-national-film-registry-reaches-700/2016-12-14/|access-date=2020-09-17|website=Library of Congress}}</ref>\n\n== Plot ==\nAt a [[San Francisco]] [[pet store]], socialite Melanie Daniels meets lawyer Mitch Brenner who is looking to buy [[lovebird]]s for his sister Cathy's 11th birthday. Recognizing Melanie from her court appearance regarding a practical joke gone awry, Mitch pretends to mistake her for a shop employee. Mitch tests Melanie's knowledge of birds, which she fails. He discloses his prior knowledge of her and that his ruse was intended to make her appreciate being on the other end of a joke. Mitch leaves without buying anything. Finding him attractive, Melanie buys the lovebirds to make amends and drives to [[Bodega Bay, California|Bodega Bay]] after she learns Mitch has gone to his family's farm for the weekend. Melanie is directed to the local teacher, Annie Hayworth, to learn Cathy's name. Annie previously dated Mitch but ended it due to Mitch's cold, overbearing mother, Lydia, who dislikes any woman in Mitch's life.\n\nMelanie rents a boat in town and crosses the bay to leave the lovebirds at the Brenner farm discreetly. Mitch spots Melanie during her retreat and drives into town to meet her at the dock. As Melanie approaches the wharf, a [[gull]] attacks her. Mitch tends to her head wound inside a diner. Lydia arrives, meets Melanie, and Mitch announces to Lydia that he is inviting Melanie to dinner. Melanie returns to Annie's house and asks to spend the night. At the farm, Lydia's hens are suddenly refusing to eat. Lydia expresses her disapproval of Melanie to Mitch due to her exaggerated reputation, as reported in gossip columns. Mitch calls Melanie and invites her to Cathy's birthday party being held the next day. Shortly after, there is a violent thud at Annie's front door. A dead gull is found at the threshold.\n\nAt Cathy's party, Melanie privately tells Mitch about her troubled past and her mother running off with another man when Melanie was Cathy's age. During a game, the children are attacked and some injured by gulls. Later that evening, as Melanie dines with the Brenners, [[American sparrow|sparrow]]s swarm the house through the chimney. Later, Mitch insists she delay driving back to San Francisco and stay the night. The next morning, Lydia visits her neighbor to discuss why their chickens will not eat. She discovers his eyeless corpse, pecked lifeless by birds, and flees in horror. As Lydia recovers at home, she fears for Cathy's safety, and Melanie offers to pick her up at school. As Melanie waits outside the schoolhouse, a large flock of [[American crow|crows]] slowly engulfs the [[jungle gym]] behind her. Anticipating an attack, she warns Annie. As they evacuate the children, the crows attack, injuring several children. Mitch finds Melanie at the diner. When gulls attack a gas station attendant, Mitch and several other men assist him outside. Spilled [[gasoline]] ignites, causing an explosion. During the escalating fire, Melanie and others rush out. More gulls attack, and Melanie takes refuge in a [[telephone booth]]. Mitch rescues her, and they get back inside the diner. A distraught woman blames Melanie for the attacks, claiming they began with her arrival.\n\nMitch and Melanie go to Annie's house to fetch Cathy. They find Annie's body outside, killed by the crows while protecting Cathy. That night, Melanie and the Brenners barricade themselves in the family home, which is attacked by waves of birds that nearly breach the boarded-up doors and windows. During a lull, Melanie investigates a fluttering sound in the attic bedroom. After discovering that the birds have pecked their way in through the roof, Melanie is violently attacked, trapping her until Mitch pulls her out. Melanie is badly injured and traumatized; Mitch insists they all drive to San Francisco to take Melanie to a hospital. As Mitch readies Melanie's car for their escape, a menacing sea of birds has quietly gathered around the Brenner house. The car radio reports bird attacks on nearby communities such as [[Santa Rosa, California|Santa Rosa]], and the military may intervene. Cathy retrieves her lovebirds (the only birds who do not attack) from the house and joins Mitch and Lydia as they carefully escort Melanie past a mass of birds and into the car. The car slowly drives away as thousands of birds are ominously perching.\n\n== Cast ==\n[[File:The Birds (1963) Trailer - Tippi Hedren attacked.png|thumb|[[Tippi Hedren]] as Melanie]]\n\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Rod Taylor]] as Mitch Brenner\n* [[Jessica Tandy]] as Lydia Brenner\n* [[Suzanne Pleshette]] as Annie Hayworth\n* [[Tippi Hedren]] as Melanie Daniels\n* [[Veronica Cartwright]] as Cathy Brenner\n* [[Ethel Griffies]] as Mrs. Bundy, ornithologist\n* [[Charles McGraw]] as Sebastian Sholes, fisherman\n* [[Ruth McDevitt]] as Mrs. MacGruder, owner of the bird shop\n* [[Lonny Chapman]] as Deke Carter, innkeeper\n* [[Joe Mantell]] as cynical businessman\n* [[Doodles Weaver]] as fisherman helping with rental boat\n* [[Malcolm Atterbury]] as Deputy Al Malone\n* John McGovern as postal clerk\n* [[Karl Swenson]] as drunken doomsayer in diner\n* [[Richard Deacon (actor)|Richard Deacon]] as Mitch's neighbor in San Francisco\n* [[Elizabeth Wilson]] as Helen Carter, Deke's wife\n* [[Bill Quinn|William Quinn]] as Sam\n}}\n\n[[Alfred Hitchcock]] makes his [[List of Alfred Hitchcock cameo appearances|signature cameo]] as a man walking dogs out of the pet shop at the beginning of the film.

The initial humor followed by horror would turn the suspense into shock.<ref name=\"hunt292\" /> At first, Hunter wanted the protagonist to be a school teacher, but this ended up being the basis for Annie Hayworth's character instead.<ref>{{harvnb|Raubicheck|Srebnick|2011|p=66}}</ref> Hunter organised his scripts by shots instead of scenes, although this did not affect the final film.<ref>{{harvnb|Raubicheck|Srebnick|2011|p=64}}</ref>\n\nHitchcock solicited comments from several people regarding the first draft of Hunter's screenplay. Consolidating their criticisms, Hitchcock wrote to Hunter, suggesting that the script (particularly the first part) was too long, contained insufficient characterization in the two leads, and that some scenes lacked drama and audience interest.<ref>{{harvnb|Auiler|1999|pp=207\u20139}}</ref> Hitchcock, at later stages, consulted with his friends, [[Hume Cronyn]] (whose wife [[Jessica Tandy]] was playing Lydia), and [[V.

Originally, he wanted the film to end without a \"The End\" card, but he was forced to include one before the film's full release.<ref name=\":12\" />\n\n=== Birds used in the film ===\nThe majority of the birds seen in the film are real, although it is estimated that more than $200,000 was spent on the creation of mechanical birds for the film.<ref>{{harvnb|Moral|2013|p=97}}</ref><ref name=\":02\" /> Ray Berwick was in charge of the live birds used in the production, training and catching many of them himself. Some of the \"crows\" were actually [[Common raven|ravens]]. The gulls were caught in the San Francisco garbage dump<ref>{{harvnb|Moral|2013|p=99}}</ref> and the sparrows were caught by John \"Bud\" Cardos. However, the captured sparrows had to be used alongside birds from pet shops to achieve full effect in the scene where they invade the house.<ref>{{harvnb|Moral|2013|pp=102\u2013103}}</ref>\n\n=== Soundtrack ===\n[[File:MIM Mixtur-Trautonium CN5834.jpg|right|thumb|Many of the sound effects were created on the [[Trautonium|Mixtur-Trautonium]], an electronic musical instrument developed by [[Oskar Sala]].]]\nHitchcock decided to do without any conventional incidental [[Film score|score]].<ref name=\"a516\">{{harvnb|Auiler|1999|p=516}}</ref> Instead, he made use of [[sound effect]]s and sparse [[source music]] in counterpoint to calculated silences. He wanted to use the electroacoustic [[Trautonium|Mixtur-Trautonium]] to create the bird calls and noises. He had first encountered this predecessor to the [[synthesizer]] on Berlin radio in the late 1920s. It was invented by Friedrich Trautwein, and further developed by [[Oskar Sala]] into the Trautonium, which would create some of the bird sounds for this film.<ref name=\"pinch\">{{harvnb|Pinch|Trocco|2004|p=54}}</ref>\n\nThe director commissioned Sala and Remi Gassmann to design an electronic soundtrack.<ref name=\"a516\" /> They are credited with \"electronic sound production and composition\", and Hitchcock's previous musical collaborator, [[Bernard Herrmann]], is credited as \"sound consultant\".\n\nSource music includes the first of [[Claude Debussy]]'s ''[[Arabesques (Debussy)|Deux arabesques]]'', which Tippi Hedren's character plays on [[piano]], and \"Nickety Nackety Now Now Now\" by [[Folk music|folk]] musician [[Chubby Parker]], which is sung by the schoolchildren.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://americanhistory.si.edu/collections/search/object/nmah_1335364|title=Nickety Nackety Now Now Now; King Kong Kitchie Ki-me-o|website=americanhistory.si.edu|access-date=2020-10-11}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://lomaxky.omeka.net/items/show/1098|title=The Lomax Kentucky Recordings|website=lomaxky.omeka.net|access-date=2020-10-11}}</ref><ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rt2ZKLlbVTE 1931 Chubby Parker recording on YouTube]</ref>\n\n=== Special effects ===\nOnce the crow attack and attic scenes were assembled by the film's editor, [[George Tomasini]], they were sent to the special effects department for enhancement.<ref>{{harvnb|Moral|2013|p=142}}</ref> The film required myriad special effects and Hitchcock commissioned the help of various studios. The special effects shots of the attacking birds were completed at [[Walt Disney Studios (Burbank)|Walt Disney Studios]] by animator/technician [[Ub Iwerks]], who used the [[sodium vapor process]] (\"yellow screen\"), which he had helped to develop. The SV process films the subject against a screen lit with narrow-spectrum sodium vapor lights. Unlike most compositing processes, SVP shoots two separate elements of the footage simultaneously using a beam-splitter. One reel is regular film stock and the other a film stock with emulsion sensitive only to the sodium vapor wavelength. This results in very precise [[Matte (filmmaking)|matte shots]] compared to [[Chroma key|blue screen]] special effects, necessary due to \"fringing\" of the image from the birds' rapid wing flapping.<ref>{{harvnb|Hitchcock|Gottlieb|1997|p=315}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://the.hitchcock.zone/wiki/Cinemafantastique_(1980)_-_The_Making_of_Alfred_Hitchcock's_The_Birds|title=Cinemafantastique (1980) \u2013 The Making of Alfred Hitchcock's The Birds|website=the.hitchcock.zone|access-date=19 October 2018}}</ref> At Disney, Iwerks worked on the following scenes: the children's party, Melanie driving to Bodega Bay, and the first two cuts of the crow attack sequence.<ref name=\":0\">{{harvnb|Moral|2013|p=143}}</ref> One of the biggest challenges facing Iwerks was the scene where a number of sparrows fly in through the chimney of the family home. Utilizing an [[optical printer]], his superposition of a group of small birds flying inside an enclosed glass booth made it possible to multiply the birds in the living room. Most of the special effects work done at Disney was completed in the Process Lab on printer 10, which was made from Iwerks' own original design.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nAt [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]], Bob Hoag was put in charge of the optical effects for the sequence where Melanie hides inside a telephone booth as it is attacked by the birds. Hitchcock had requested that Hoag remove any shot where Melanie looked placid and urged that she be in constant movement instead. Hoag, along with a team of 30, worked together on the blue backing and sodium matte shots.<ref name=\":0\" /> [[Linwood G. Dunn|Linwood Dunn]], a founder of Film Effects of Hollywood, was commissioned to work on the attic scene. He was asked to produce a rough cut of the sequence before Hitchcock left for Berlin in December 1962.<ref name=\":1\">{{harvnb|Moral|2013|p=144}}</ref> Bill Abbott, at [[20th Century Fox|Fox]], was in charge of the optical effects for the crow attack sequence, which would take six weeks to finish. Abbott organised two teams\u2014both working 11 hours a day\u2014to work on the sequence simultaneously. Abbott's biggest challenge was size ratio, as he had to ensure that the birds looked like they were attacking the children. He achieved this by placing the birds within frame and zooming in on them to make them the correct size in proportion to the children.<ref name=\":1\" /> At [[Universal Pictures|Universal-International Pictures]], associate editor Ross Hoffman and matte artist Albert Whitlock both worked on designing the town's backdrop, including the birds in the trees and the scenery for the river shots of Melanie's car arriving in Bodega Bay.<ref name=\":1\" /> ''The Birds'' featured 370 effects shots, the final shot being a composite of 32 separate elements.\n\n== Themes and style ==\n=== Themes ===\nAmong the central themes explored in ''The Birds'' are those of love and violence. The representation of the birds in the film constantly changes to reflect the development of these themes, and the story itself. At first, the lovebirds in the pet store signify the blossoming love between Melanie and Mitch, and the [[sexual tension]] between the two.<ref>{{harvnb|Paglia|1998|p=24}}</ref> However, the birds' symbolism changes once they begin to attack Bodega Bay. Hitchcock stated in an interview that the birds in the film rise up against the humans to punish them for taking nature for granted.<ref>{{harvnb|Paglia|1998|p=87}}</ref>\n\nAnother theme explored within the film is the entrapment of civilians.<ref>{{harvnb|Raubicheck|Srebnick|2011|p=140}}</ref> This is because the birds attack anyone who goes outside, consequently leaving people trapped inside their homes.\n\nHumanities scholar [[Camille Paglia]] wrote a monograph about the film for the BFI Film Classics series. She interprets it as an ode to the many facets of female sexuality and, by extension, nature itself. She notes that women play pivotal roles in it. Mitch is defined by his relationships with his mother, sister, and ex-lover\u2014a careful balance that is disrupted by his attraction to the beautiful Melanie.<ref>{{harvnb|Paglia|1998}}</ref>\n\n{{quote box\n| width = 30em\n| bgcolor = cornsilk\n| align = right\n| fontsize = 101%\n| salign = right\n| quote = ''\"The theme [of the film], after all, is complacency, as the director has stated on innumerable occasions. When we first meet each of the major characters, their infinite capacity of self-absorption is emphasized. Tippi Hedren's bored socialite is addicted to elaborately time-consuming practical jokes. Rod Taylor's self-righteous lawyer flaunts his arrogant sensuality, Suzanne Pleshette, his ex-fianc\u00e9e, wallows in self-pity, and Jessica Tandy, his possessive mother, cringes from her fear of loneliness''.<br />''With such complex, unsympathetic characters to contend with, the audience begins to identify with the point of view of the birds, actually the inhuman point of view...\"''\n| source = '''\u2013 Film historian [[Andrew Sarris]] (1998)'''<ref>{{harvnb|Sarris|1998|p=297}}</ref>\n}}\n\n=== Style ===\n[[Montage (filmmaking)|Montage editing]] and slow pacing are used within the film to build suspense and elicit a greater emotional response from the audience during the attack scenes: \"The pattern of ''The Birds'' was deliberately to go slow\".<ref>{{harvnb|Hitchcock|Gottlieb|1997|p=294}}</ref> This is exemplified in the scene where the birds gradually gather outside of the school, while an unobservant Melanie sits and waits on the bench. The camera then cuts between her and the increasing number of birds that swoop down onto the jungle gym behind her until they finally attack.\n\n[[Eyeline match]]es and [[Point-of-view shot|point-of-view]] (POV) shots within the film encourage audience identification with particular characters and their subjective experiences. This is achieved by cutting between the character and the object of their gaze. For example, when Melanie crosses the bay near the beginning of the film, the camera cuts between close-ups of her face and shots of the Brenner house from her perspective, as she watches Mitch fall for her prank.<ref>{{harvnb|Hitchcock|Gottlieb|1997|p=291}}</ref>\n\nThe focus on editing and visuals rather than dialogue is also an element of [[Cin\u00e9ma pur|pure cinema]] that Hitchcock largely uses throughout his work.<ref>{{harvnb|Hitchcock|Gottlieb|1997|p=290}}</ref>\n\n== Release and accolades ==\nThe film premiered March 28, 1963, in New York City. The [[Museum of Modern Art]] hosted an invitation-only screening as part of a 50-film retrospective of Hitchcock's film work. The MOMA series had a booklet with a [[monograph]] on the director written by [[Peter Bogdanovich]].
