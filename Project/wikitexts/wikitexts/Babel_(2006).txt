The [[multiperspectivity|multi-narrative]] drama completes Arriaga's and I\u00f1\u00e1rritu's ''Death Trilogy'', following ''[[Amores perros]]'' and ''[[21 Grams]]''.<ref>Liner notes for the US release of the original soundtrack album ([[Concord Records]] catalog number CCD2-30191-2)</ref> It is an [[international co-production]] among companies based in the United States, Mexico and France. The film features an [[ensemble cast]] and use of [[hyperlink cinema]], which portrays interwoven stories taking place in Morocco, Japan, Mexico, and the United States.\n\n''Babel'' was selected to compete for the [[Palme d'Or]] at the [[2006 Cannes Film Festival]], where Gonz\u00e1lez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu won the [[Best Director Award (Cannes Film Festival)|Best Director Award]]. The film was later screened at the [[Toronto International Film Festival]]. The film [[Limited release|opened in selected cities]] in the United States on 27 October 2006, and went into wide release on 10 November 2006. ''Babel'' received positive reviews and was a financial success, grossing $135 million worldwide. It eventually won the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture \u2013 Drama]], and received seven [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nominations, including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]], and [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]] for both [[Adriana Barraza]] and [[Rinko Kikuchi]], winning for [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Best Original Score]].\n\n== Plot ==\n''Babel'' has four main strains of actions and characters which are location-based. The film is not edited in a linear chronological order.\n\n=== Morocco ===\nIn a desert in Morocco, Abdullah, a [[goatherder]], buys a [[.270 Winchester]] [[Winchester Model 70|M70 rifle]] and a box of ammunition from his neighbor Hassan Ibrahim to shoot the jackals that have been preying on his goats. Abdullah gives the rifle to his two young sons, Yussef and Ahmed, and sends them out to tend to the herd. Ahmed, the older of the two, criticises Yussef for spying on their sister while she changes her clothes. Doubtful of the rifle's purported three-kilometer range, they decide to test it out, aiming first at rocks, a moving car on a highway below, and then at a bus carrying Western tourists. Yussef's bullet hits the bus, critically wounding Susan Jones, an American woman from [[San Diego]] who is traveling with her husband Richard on vacation.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Babel (Review) |last=Travers |first=Peter |date=20 October 2006 |magazine=[[Rolling Stone]] |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/movie/9387674/review/12087181/babel |access-date=11 December 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061211132639/http://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/movie/9387674/review/12087181/babel |archive-date=11 December 2006 |url-status=dead}}</ref> The two boys realize what has happened and flee the scene, hiding the rifle in the hills.\n\nGlimpses of television news programs reveal that the US government considers the shooting a terrorist act and is pressuring the Moroccan government to apprehend the culprits. Abdullah, who has heard about the shooting, asks the boys where the rifle is and beats the truth out of them. Finally, the three try to flee but are spotted. The police corner the father and boys on the rocky slope of a hill and open fire. After Ahmed is hit in the leg, Yussef returns fire, striking one police officer in the shoulder. The police continue shooting, hitting Ahmed in the back, severely injuring him. Yussef then surrenders, admitting responsibility for shooting the American and asking for medical assistance; the police are shocked to realise they were shooting at children.\n\n=== Richard/Susan ===\nRichard and Susan are an American couple who came on vacation to Morocco. When Susan is shot on the tour bus, Richard orders the bus driver to the nearest village, [[Tazarine]]. The other tourists wait for some time, but they eventually demand to leave, fearing the heat and that they may be the target of further attacks. Richard tells the tour group to wait for the ambulance, which never arrives, and eventually the bus leaves without them. The couple stays behind with the bus's tour guide, Anwar, still waiting for transport to a hospital. A helicopter arrives and carries Richard and Susan to a hospital in [[Casablanca]], where she is expected to recover.\n\n=== United States/Mexico ===\nRichard and Susan's Mexican nanny, Amelia, tends to their children, Debbie and Mike, in their San Diego, California home. When Amelia learns of Susan's injury, she is forced to take care of the children longer than planned and becomes worried that she will miss her son's wedding. Unable to secure any other help to care for them, she calls Richard for advice, who tells her that she has to stay with the children. Without his permission, Amelia decides to take the children with her to the wedding in a rural community near [[Tijuana]], Mexico. Rather than staying the night in Mexico with the children, Amelia decides to drive back to the States with Santiago. He has been drinking heavily and the border guards become suspicious of him and the American children in the car. Amelia has passports for all four travelers, but no letter of consent from the children's parents allowing her to take them out of the United States. Santiago gets irritated by the authoritative control that does not want to listen to his explanation, forces the barricade with the car and drives madly. He soon abandons Amelia and the children in the desert.\n\nRealizing that they will all die if she cannot get help, Amelia leaves the children behind to find someone, ordering them not to move. She eventually finds a [[US Border Patrol]] officer. After he places Amelia under arrest, she and the officer travel back to where she had left the children, but they are not there. Amelia is taken back to a Border Patrol station, where she is eventually informed that the children have been found and that Richard, while outraged, has agreed not to press charges. However, she is told she will be deported from the US where she has been working illegally. At the border, a tearful Amelia is greeted by her son.\n\n=== Japan ===\nChieko Wataya (\u7dbf\u8c37 \u5343\u6075\u5b50 ''Wataya Chieko'') is a rebellious teenage girl who is profoundly deaf and non-verbal. She is also self-conscious and unhappy because of her disability. While out with friends, she finds a teenage boy attractive, and following an unsuccessful attempt at socializing, exposes herself to him under a table. She has a dental appointment and tries to kiss the dentist, who sends her away. Chieko encounters two police detectives who question her about her father. She invites one of the detectives, Kenji Mamiya (\u771f\u5bae \u8ce2\u6cbb ''Mamiya Kenji''), back to the high-rise apartment that she shares with her father. Wrongly supposing that the detectives are investigating her father's involvement in her mother's suicide, she explains to Mamiya that her father was asleep when her mother jumped off the balcony and that she witnessed this herself. The detectives are actually investigating a hunting trip Yasujiro took in Morocco. Soon after learning this, Chieko approaches Mamiya nude and attempts to seduce him. He resists her approaches but comforts her as she bursts into tears.\n\nLeaving the apartment, Mamiya crosses paths with Yasujiro and questions him about the rifle. Yasujiro explains that there was no black market involvement; he gave his rifle as a gift to Hassan Ibrahim, his hunting guide on a trip in Morocco. About to depart, Mamiya offers condolences for the wife's suicide. Yasujiro, however, is confused by the mention of a balcony and angrily replies that his wife shot herself, and that Chieko was the first to discover her. As Mamiya sits in a restaurant, watching news of Susan's recovery, Yasujiro comforts his daughter with a hug as she stands at their balcony in mourning, before the scene pans out to the cityscape.\n\n== Themes  ==\n\n=== As a network narrative ===\n''Babel'' can be analyzed as a [[Networked narrative|network narrative]] in which its characters, scattered across the globe, represent different nodes of a network that is connected by various strands. The movie not only incorporates quite a large number of characters but they also are, as is typical for network narratives, equally important. It is noticeable that ''Babel'' has multiple protagonists who, as a consequence, make the plot more complex in relation to time and causality.\n\nOne of the central connections between all of the main characters is the rifle. Over the course of the movie, the viewer finds out that Yasujiro Wataya visits Morocco for a hunting trip and gifts the rifle to his guide, Hassan Ibrahim, who then sells it to Abdullah from where it gets passed on to his sons. Susan Jones, in turn, is shot with that very same rifle which also has a tragic impact on Amelia Hern\u00e1ndez' life. It is observable that \"all characters are affected by the connections created between them \u2013 connections that influence both their individual trajectories as characters and the overall structure of the plot\".<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Poulaki |first1=Maria |title=Network films and complex causality |journal=Screen |date=2014 |volume=55 |issue=3 |page=394 |doi=10.1093/screen/hju020 |url=https://academic.oup.com/screen/article-abstract/55/3/379/1624541?redirectedFrom=fulltext}}</ref>\n\nIt shows how a single object can serve as a connection between many different characters (or nodes in a network) who don't necessarily need to know each other. Even though the rifle is not passed on any further, it continues to influence the characters' lives in significant ways. This demonstrates how the smallest actions on one side of the world can ultimately lead to a complete change of another person's life elsewhere, without there being any form of direct contact between the two (also see [[Butterfly effect]]). \nIt also creates a small-world effect, in which \"characters will intersect again and again\"<ref>{{cite book |last1=Bordwell |first1=David |title=The Way Hollywood Tells It: Story and Style in Modern Movies |date=2006 |publisher=University of California Press |page=98}}</ref> either directly or indirectly and mostly by accident.

He made a life changing travel to Morocco at 17. In his previous travels to Japan he was convinced to return with a camera someday, and finally his own move from Mexico to the USA was also present in the film.\n\nAsked about the idea for the film, which is credited to Arriaga and Gonzalez Inarritu, the former said, \"It is credited to him because I had this story first placed only in two countries. He asked to have it in four and that\u2019s why he has the \u2018idea by\u2019 credit.\" Asked also if the idea of setting \u201cBabel\u2019s\u201d two other stories in Morocco and Japan was from Gonzalez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu, Arriaga answered \"No, he said put it wherever you want,\".<ref name=\"TheHollywoodReporter\">{{Cite web |url= https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/babel-beginnings-as-life-changing-129834/ |title= 'Babel' beginnings as life-changing day story  |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |date= 9 February 2007 |publisher=Victoria Alonso |accessdate=8 September 2022}}</ref>\n\n===Casting===\nWhen the 24-year-old [[Rinko Kikuchi]] auditioned for the role of Chieko, I\u00f1arritu was surprised by her talent but was reluctant due to her not being deaf.

After its completion, director Alejandro Gonz\u00e1lez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu and screenwriter Guillermo Arriaga had a falling-out regarding the authorship of their previous film, ''[[21 Grams]]''. Arriaga argued that cinema is a collaborative medium, and that both he and Gonz\u00e1lez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu are thus the authors of the films they have worked on together. Gonz\u00e1lez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu claimed sole credit as the ''[[auteur]]'' of those same films, minimizing Arriaga's contribution to the pictures. Following this dispute, I\u00f1\u00e1rritu banned Arriaga from attending the [[2006 Cannes Film Festival]] screening of ''Babel'', an act for which the director was criticized.<ref>{{cite web|title=Dueling auteurs: Whose movie is it? |last=Rafferty |first=Terrence |work=[[International Herald-Tribune]] |url=http://www.iht.com/articles/2006/10/19/news/auteur.php |access-date=16 November 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061116184107/http://www.iht.com/articles/2006/10/19/news/auteur.php |archive-date=16 November 2006|date=19 October 2006}}</ref>\n\n== Music ==\n{{main|Babel (soundtrack)}}\nThe film's original [[Film score|score]] and songs were composed and produced by [[Gustavo Santaolalla]].
