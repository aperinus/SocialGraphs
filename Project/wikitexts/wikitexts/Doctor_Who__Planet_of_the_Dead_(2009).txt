It was [[simulcast|simultaneously broadcast]] on [[BBC One]] and [[BBC HD]] on 11 April 2009.   The specials served as lead actor [[David Tennant]]'s denouement as the [[Tenth Doctor]]. He is joined in the episode by actress [[Michelle Ryan]], who plays Lady Christina de Souza, a one-off [[companion (Doctor Who)|companion]] to the Doctor. The episode was co-written by [[Russell T Davies]] and [[Gareth Roberts (writer)|Gareth Roberts]], the first writing partnership since the show's revival in 2005. \"Planet of the Dead\" serves as the 200th story of ''Doctor Who''.\n\nThe episode depicts Christina fleeing the police from a museum robbery by boarding a bus that accidentally travels from London to the desert planet of San Helios, trapping her, the Doctor, and several passengers on board the damaged vehicle. After the bus driver dies trying to return to Earth, the [[Unified Intelligence Taskforce]], headed by [[List of UNIT personnel#Captain Erisa Magambo|Captain Erisa Magambo]] ([[Noma Dumezweni]]) and scientific advisor [[List of UNIT personnel#Malcolm Taylor|Malcolm Taylor]] ([[Lee Evans (comedian)|Lee Evans]]), attempt to return the bus while preventing a race of metallic stingray aliens from posing a threat to Earth. At the end of the episode, one of the passengers delivers a warning to the Doctor that \"he will knock four times\", foreshadowing the remaining three specials.\n\n\"Planet of the Dead\" was the first ''Doctor Who'' episode to be filmed in [[high-definition television|high definition]], after a positive reaction to the visual quality of spin-off series ''[[Torchwood]]'' and the financial viability of HDTV convinced the production team to switch formats. To ensure that the desert scenes looked as realistic as possible, the production team filmed in Dubai for three days, sending several props, including a 1980 double-decker [[Bristol VR]] bus, to the United Arab Emirates for filming. After the bus was unintentionally damaged in Dubai by a shipping container, Davies rewrote the script to explain the damage in the narrative.\n\nThe audience gave the episode an [[Appreciation Index]] of 88<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.gallifreyone.com/cgi-bin/viewnews.cgi?id=EkFAZFkpkuSGfXfOKj&tmpl=newsrss&style=feedstyle |title=Outpost Gallifrey: Doctor Who RSS News Feed |publisher=Gallifreyone.com |date=2009-04-14 |access-date=2009-07-01}}</ref>\u2014considered excellent.\n\n==Plot==\n[[File:Cardiff April 2010 107 (4530718878).jpg|thumb|left|upright|The Tritovores and the costume of Lady Christina at the Doctor Who Experience.]]\nThe gentlewoman [[burglar]] Lady Christina de Souza steals a [[gold]] [[chalice]] once belonging to King [[\u00c6thelstan]] from a [[London]] [[museum]] and hops on a double-decker bus. The [[Tenth Doctor]] joins her and the other passengers, just before the bus passes through a [[wormhole]] and ends up on the sands of the planet San Helios. The Doctor studies the wormhole and determines that the bus protected them from its effects like a [[Faraday cage]], but he is unable to stop the driver from stepping back through the wormhole. When the driver's burnt [[skeleton]] appears on Earth, [[UNIT]] forces are alerted, led by [[List of UNIT personnel#Captain Erisa Magambo|Captain Erisa Magambo]] and aided by scientific adviser [[List of UNIT personnel#Malcolm Taylor|Malcolm Taylor]].\n \nWhile the others attempt to repair the bus, the Doctor and Christina scout ahead and spot what appears to be a sandstorm on the horizon. The Doctor contacts UNIT to get an analysis of the wormhole. The Doctor and Christina encounter two fly-themed Tritovores, named Sorvin and Praygat, who take them to their wrecked spaceship. They explain they were going to pick up supplies at San Helios, which had recently housed billions of people but now is totally desert. The Doctor has them scan the approaching sandstorm and finds that it is actually a swarm of [[stingray]]-themed aliens that are destroying the ecosystem. He suspects the swarm is generating the wormhole to travel to their next planet to feed upon, and they must hurry and close the wormhole before the aliens can reach Earth. Christina uses her burglary skills to retrieve a power crystal and its mounting from the Tritovore ship, but accidentally wakes an alien stingray, which consumes the Tritovores.\n \nWith the swarm nearly on them, the Doctor uses the crystal's mounting, an anti-gravity device, to enable the bus to fly. To control it, he persuades Christina to give him the gold chalice, which he smashes, using it to interface the bus's controls with the mountings. They fly back through the wormhole just as Malcolm closes it, but not before three stingrays sneak through, which UNIT quickly kill with Stinger missiles. Christina asks the Doctor to take her with him, but he refuses right before she is arrested; however, he allows her to escape from the police and fly off on the bus before they can stop her. As the Doctor is about to depart in his TARDIS, Carmen, a bus passenger who has low-level psychic abilities, tells him that his \"song\" is ending and \"he will knock four times\".\n\n==Production==\n\n===Writing and casting===\n[[File:David Tennant and Michelle Ryan.jpg|thumb|Ryan and Tennant reviewing the script before filming in [[Butetown]] at the [[A4232 road#Queen's Gate Tunnel|Queen's Gate Tunnel]] on 28 January 2009.]]\nRussell T Davies co-wrote the episode with [[Gareth Roberts (writer)|Gareth Roberts]], the first credited writing partnership for the show since its 2005 revival.<ref name=\"desertstorm\" /> \"Planet of the Dead\" was a departure from Roberts' usual stories\u2014Roberts had previously only written pseudo-historical stories\u2014and instead consisted of wild science fiction elements from his literary career and teenage imagination. The episode had no clear concept\u2014such as [[Shakespeare]] and [[Carrionite|witches]] in \"[[The Shakespeare Code]]\" or [[Agatha Christie]] and a [[murder mystery]] in \"[[The Unicorn and the Wasp]]\"\u2014and instead was a deliberate \"clash [of concepts] with many disparate elements\".

She said, \"there's been a little accident with the bus [...] it's a disaster; the bus is fucked.\" When I got into the office, I was handed a photograph\u2013and my initial reaction was absolute horror. We called an emergency meeting. Russell came in [...] and we discussed our options. We had bought an identical London bus to film on in Cardiff, so could we send that out to Dubai? We could have got it out in time if it'd left Cardiff, literally, the next day, but we'd have had to find a third bus, an exact replica, to film on in Cardiff a week later. It had taken us a month to find the one we had. It was even mooted that we'd have to forget Dubai and opt for a beach in the UK. But Russell's response was \"Okay, let's embrace it. Let's say that the bus was damaged on its way to the alien planet. [...] He wove it into the narrative. We're not trying to hide the damage at all. In fact, we show it off, enhancing it with special effects, smoke and sparks. It works rather marvellously.

Simon Brew of science fiction blog ''Den of Geek'' said the episode was \"by turns ambitious and predictable\" but \"still quite entertaining\". The first part of the review mentioned an objection from his wife that the bus trapped in the sand \"[looked] really fake\", despite the episode being actually filmed in Dubai, and then mentioned Brew's appreciation of the concept of people stranded in the desert and concluded that \"made a fair fist of it\". Brew positively reviewed Michelle Ryan's performance\u2014believing it similar to her role in ''[[Bionic Woman (2007 TV series)|Bionic Woman]]'' than to her role as [[Zoe Slater]] in ''[[EastEnders]]''\u2014and Lee Evans' performance as Malcolm Taylor, calling him the highlight of the episode because of his dialogue. He closed his review by saying that \"'Planet of the Dead' was passable enough\": he thought it \"never really gelled\" for him; but he thought it was overall entertaining and was excited for the remaining three specials as a result of Carmen's prophecy.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.denofgeek.com/television/234773/doctor_who_planet_of_the_dead_review.html|title=Doctor Who: Planet of the Dead review|last=Brew|first=Simon|date=14 April 2009|publisher=Den of Geek|access-date=18 April 2009}}</ref>\n\n[[Charlie Jane Anders]] of [[io9]] \"mostly loved 'Planet of the Dead'\", commenting that it was a standard Russell T Davies script:\n{{blockquote|POTD was pretty much everything you've come to expect from Russell T. Davies' Who: crazy adventures, slightly cartoony characters, clever dialogue, moments of sheer silly fun, a childlike solemnity, a miraculous save, bombastic music, and one woman who's held up as being the most special person ever.\n\nIt didn't hurt that POTD had all the elements of a cracking good story: The Doctor and friends trapped on an alien planet, on the other side of the universe, with no easy way to get home. Alien creatures who might be hostile. A deadly swarm coming to tear our heroes apart. And UNIT on the other side of the wormhole, trying to come to grips with this almost unimaginable threat.<ref name=\"charlie\" />}}\nShe compared it to two previous episodes, \"[[The Impossible Planet]]\" and \"[[Midnight (Doctor Who)|Midnight]]\", both of which she enjoyed. She criticised three aspects of the episode: Lady Christina, who was the \"first [Russell T Davies] heroine who actually filled [her] with revulsion\", leaving her hoping that the character would be killed off-screen, Malcolm's reluctance to close the wormhole and the implausibility of only three stingrays travelling through it. She thought that the episode was \"a pretty solid adventure with a cool set of monsters\".<ref name=\"charlie\">{{Cite web|url=http://io9.com/5209116/doctor-whos-easter-hit-parade|title=Doctor Who's Easter Hit Parade|last=Anders|first=Charlie Jane|author-link=Charlie Jane Anders|date=12 April 2009|publisher=[[io9]]|access-date=18 April 2009}}</ref>\n\nBen Rawson-Jones of entertainment website [[Digital Spy]] gave the episode two stars out of five. He characterised the episode as being \"as hollow as a big chocolate Easter egg\" because it was \"lacking in the enthralling drama and compelling characterisation that has been the lynchpin of the Russell T Davies era\". His main criticism was towards Ryan's character, describing the romantic tension between Christina and the Doctor as \"feeling forced\" and arguing that Ryan was \"utterly unconvincing\" as Christina. Conversely, he was appreciative of Strong's direction and the UNIT subplot. Specifically, he approved of Evans' performance, noting that \"the fact that Malcolm names a unit of measurement after himself is both inspired and hilarious\". His review ended by describing the episode as \"lifeless for much of the hour\" and expressing his hope that the ambiguous entity from Carmen's premonition would \"hurry up\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/cult/a152500/dr-who-planet-of-the-dead-the-verdict.html|title=Dr Who: 'Planet of the Dead' \u2013 The Verdict|last=Rawson-Jones|first=Ben|date=11 April 2009|work=Digital Spy|access-date=18 April 2009}}</ref>\n\nOrlando Parfitt of [[IGN]] gave the episode a 7.1 (Good) rating out of ten. Parfitt called it a \"straightforward story\" that did not elevate to the level of excitement typically seen in ''Doctor Who'' until the episode's climax, instead describing the majority of the story as being \"taken up with Tennant and Ryan standing in the desert, swapping flirtatious banter in between proclaiming how dire their situation is\", and criticised the writing of the part of the episode where the bus was on San Helios, claiming that plot devices such as the Tritovore or Taylor being held at gunpoint and ordered to close the wormhole as \"feel[ing] forced and unnaturally shoe-horned into the script\". His praise of the episode went to Ryan and Evans: although he thought of Christina as a \"shameless [[Lara Croft]] ripoff\", he said that the character \"still proves a sexy and wise-cracking counterpart to the Doctor\"; and Evans' acting alongside Dumezweni highlighted his \"undeniably great comic acting\" as opposed to his\n\"love-it-or-hate-it\" [[stand-up comedy]]. The last paragraph of his review focused on the climax, which he thought was \"a cracker [that] just-about makes up for the previously plodding plot\", and described the entire episode as having \"enough enjoyable moments\" to entertain fans before the transmission of \"The Waters of Mars\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://uk.tv.ign.com/articles/972/972550p1.html|title=Planet of the Dead Review|last=Parfitt|first=Orlando|date=14 April 2009|work=IGN.TV|access-date=19 April 2009}}</ref>\n\n\"Planet of the Dead\" was nominated for the [[Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation, Short Form]], but lost to \"The Waters of Mars\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thehugoawards.org/hugo-history/2010-hugo-awards/ |title=2010 Hugo Awards |publisher=World Science Fiction Society |access-date=20 April 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110507164821/http://www.thehugoawards.org/hugo-history/2010-hugo-awards/ |archive-date=7 May 2011 }}</ref>\n\n===International broadcast===\nThe special aired in Canada in July on [[Space (Canadian TV channel)|Space]],<ref name=\"NA\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.channelcanada.com/Article2990.html|title=BBC Worldwide and Space Wrap Up Sci-Fi|work=channelcanada.com|access-date=2009-06-01|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120223065056/http://www.channelcanada.com/Article2990.html|archive-date=23 February 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref> and in the US on [[BBC America]] on 26 July 2009.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbcamerica.com/content/123/doctor-who-planet-of-the-dead.jsp |title=Planet of the Dead \u2013 Doctor Who |publisher=BBC America |date=2009-04-06 |access-date=2009-07-01}}</ref> In Australia, the Special aired 31 May 2009, on [[ABC (Australian TV channel)|ABC1]].
