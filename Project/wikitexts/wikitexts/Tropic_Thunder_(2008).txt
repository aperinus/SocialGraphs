The film stars Stiller, [[Jack Black]], [[Robert Downey Jr.]], [[Jay Baruchel]], and [[Brandon T. Jackson]] as a group of [[prima donna]] actors making a [[Vietnam War]] film. When their frustrated director ([[Steve Coogan]]) drops them in the middle of a jungle, they are forced to rely on their acting skills to survive the real action and danger. ''Tropic Thunder'' [[parody|parodies]] many famous war films, specifically those based on the Vietnam War. The [[ensemble cast]] includes [[Tom Cruise]], [[Nick Nolte]], [[Danny McBride]], [[Matthew McConaughey]], and [[Bill Hader]].\n\nStiller developed ''Tropic Thunder''{{'s}} premise during the production of ''[[Empire of the Sun (film)|Empire of the Sun]]'' in the spring of 1987, and later enlisted Theroux and Cohen to complete a script. The film was [[Greenlight|green-lit]] in 2006 and produced by [[Stuart Cornfeld]], Stiller, and Eric McLeod for [[Red Hour Productions]] and [[DreamWorks Pictures]] as an international coproduction between the United States, Germany, and the United Kingdom. Filming took place in 2007 on the [[Hawaiian Islands|Hawaiian island]] of [[Kaua'i]] over thirteen&nbsp;weeks and was the largest film production in the island's history. The extensive marketing campaign included faux websites for three of the main characters and their fictional films, a fictional television special, and selling the [[energy drink]] advertised in the film, \"Booty Sweat\".\n\n[[Paramount Pictures]] and DreamWorks released ''Tropic Thunder'' in the United States on August 13, 2008. It received generally positive reviews for its characters, story, faux trailers, and cast performances. However, the depiction of the mentally handicapped and use of [[blackface]] makeup attracted controversy. The film opened at the top of the American box office and retained the number-one position for three consecutive weeks, ultimately grossing more than $195 million worldwide before its release on home media on November 18, 2008. Downey was nominated for an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]], a [[BAFTA Award]], and a [[Screen Actors Guild Award]], while both he and Cruise received nominations for a [[Golden Globe Award]].\n\n== Plot ==\nHook-handed [[Vietnam veteran]] Staff Sergeant John \"Four Leaf\" Tayback's memoir ''Tropic Thunder'' is being made into a film. With the exception of newcomer supporting actor Kevin Sandusky, the cast\u2014fading [[action hero]] Tugg Speedman, overbearing five-time [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]]-winning Australian [[Method acting|method actor]] Kirk Lazarus, loudmouthed rapper Alpa Chino, and drug-addicted comedian Jeff Portnoy\u2014all cause problems for the inexperienced director Damien Cockburn, who cannot control them, resulting in a million-dollar [[pyrotechnics]] scene being wasted. With the project months behind schedule, studio executive Les Grossman gives Damien an ultimatum: get the cast under control or the project will be cancelled.\n\nOn Four Leaf's advice, Damien drops the actors into the middle of the jungle, with hidden cameras and rigged special effects explosions to film \"[[Guerrilla filmmaking|guerrilla-style]]\". The actors have guns that fire [[Blank (cartridge)|blanks]], along with a map and scene listing that will lead to a helicopter waiting at the end of the route. Unknown to the actors and production, the group has been dropped in the middle of the [[Golden Triangle (Southeast Asia)|Golden Triangle]], the home of the [[heroin]]-producing Flaming Dragon gang. Just as the group is about to set off, Damien inadvertently steps on an old land mine and is blown up, stunning the actors. Tugg, believing Damien faked his death to encourage the cast to give better performances, assures the others that Damien is alive, and that they are still shooting the film. Kirk is unconvinced but joins them in their trek to get out of the jungle.\n\nWhen Four Leaf and pyrotechnics operator Cody Underwood try to locate the deceased director, they are captured by Flaming Dragon. Four Leaf is revealed to have hands; he confesses to Underwood that he actually served in the [[United States Coast Guard|Coast Guard]], has never left the United States, and that he wrote his \"memoir\" as a tribute. As the actors continue through the jungle, Kirk, who has become convinced that Tugg's ineptitude is putting them in jeopardy, and Kevin, the only actor who bothered to properly prepare for his role, discover that Tugg is leading them in the wrong direction. The resulting argument results in Kirk leading the rest of the cast back toward the resort they are staying at as an increasingly delirious Tugg is captured by Flaming Dragon. Taken to their base, Tugg believes it is a [[Prisoner-of-war camp|POW camp]] from the script. The gang discovers he is the star of their favorite film, the [[box-office bomb]] ''Simple Jack'', and forces him to reenact it several times a day, leading him to become [[Stockholm syndrome|brainwashed]].\n\nMeanwhile, in [[Los Angeles]], Tugg's agent, Rick \"Pecker\" Peck, confronts Les over an unfulfilled term in Tugg's contract that entitles him to a [[TiVo]]. Flaming Dragon calls during the discussion and demands a ransom for Tugg, but Les instead delivers a profanity-laden death threat. Les is uninterested in rescuing Tugg and is instead delighted at the prospect of a large insurance payout if Tugg dies. He attempts to convince Pecker to play along by promising a [[Gulfstream V]] jet and \"lots of money\".\n\nKirk, Alpa, Jeff, and Kevin discover Flaming Dragon's heroin factory. After witnessing Tugg being [[torture]]d, they plan a rescue attempt based on the film's script. Kirk impersonates a farmer towing a \"captured\" Jeff on the back of a [[water buffalo]], distracting the armed guards so Alpa and Kevin can infiltrate and find the prisoners, but a combination of broken Mandarin Chinese and inconsistencies in his story sets off the gang's boss. The actors, knowing their cover has been blown, begin firing, fooling the gang members into surrender. Their control of the gang falls apart when Jeff grabs the leader and heads for the drugs, and the gang, realizing the guns fire blanks, recover their guns and fight back.\n\nThe four actors locate Four Leaf, Underwood, and Tugg and cross a bridge rigged to explode to get to Underwood's helicopter. Tugg initially remains behind, believing Flaming Dragon to be his \"family\", but runs back screaming, chased by an angry horde. Four Leaf destroys the bridge, rescuing Tugg, but as the helicopter takes off, the gang boss fires an [[rocket-propelled grenade|RPG]] at the helicopter. Rick unexpectedly stumbles out of the jungle and saves them by throwing a TiVo box into the path of the rocket. The crew return to [[Hollywood, Los Angeles|Hollywood]] and footage from the hidden cameras is compiled into the feature film ''Tropic Blunder'', which becomes a major critical and commercial success. The film wins Tugg his first Academy Award, which Kirk presents to him at the ceremony. Les ends the film, dancing to \"Get Back\" by Ludacris as the credits start to roll.\n\n==Cast==\n<!--- Cast and order per tombstone closing credits, roles per closing credits scroll --->\n* [[Ben Stiller]] as Tugg Speedman: Once the highest-paid, highest-grossing action film star ever due to his ''Scorcher'' franchise, his career has stalled, and he now has a reputation for appearing in nothing but box office bombs. After drawing negative coverage for his portrayal in ''Simple Jack'', in which he plays a mentally-challenged farm boy who can talk to animals, he takes the role of Four Leaf Tayback in an attempt to save his career. Tugg's faux trailer at the film's start is a preview for ''Scorcher VI: Global Meltdown'', the latest in his series and a spoof of long-running summer action blockbuster franchises.\n* [[Jack Black]] as Jeff Portnoy: A [[Drug addiction|drug-addicted]] comedian-actor well known for portraying multiple parts in films that rely on [[Toilet humour|toilet humor]], particularly jokes about flatulence. In the [[Story within a story#film within a film|film-within-a-film]], he plays a raspy-voiced soldier named Fats. He fears he is only considered an actor because of his farts and nothing else. Portnoy's faux trailer for juvenile [[family film|family comedy]] ''The Fatties: Fart 2'', about a family (with each member played by Portnoy) that enjoys passing gas, spoofs [[Eddie Murphy]]'s portrayal of multiple characters in films such as ''[[Nutty Professor II: The Klumps]]''.<ref name=\"TrailerEddie\" /><ref name=\"CapeFatties\" /><ref name=\"EagleTFatties\" />\n* [[Robert Downey Jr.]] as Kirk Lazarus: An Australian [[Method acting|method actor]] and five-time [[Academy Award]] winner, Lazarus had a controversial \"[[Blackface|pigmentation alteration]]\" surgery to temporarily darken his skin for his portrayal of the black character, Staff Sergeant Lincoln Osiris. Lazarus refuses to break character until he has recorded the DVD commentary for a part and only speaks in his character's [[African American Vernacular English]]. Lazarus's faux trailer, ''Satan's Alley'', is about two gay monks in a 12th-century Irish monastery, parodying films like ''[[Brokeback Mountain]]'' and Downey's own scenes with [[Tobey Maguire]] (who in a cameo portrays himself playing the other monk) in ''[[Wonder Boys (film)|Wonder Boys]]''.<ref name=\"WonderBoysAlley\" /> Downey said he modeled Lazarus on three actors: [[Russell Crowe]], [[Daniel Day-Lewis]] and [[Colin Farrell]]. Lazarus was originally intended to be Irish, but Downey felt more comfortable using an Australian accent, since he had portrayed an Australian character in ''[[Natural Born Killers]]''.<ref name=\"18facts\" />\n* [[Nick Nolte]] as Four Leaf Tayback: The author of ''Tropic Thunder'', a fake memoir of his war experiences on which the film-within-a-film is based. He suggests the idea of dropping the actors in the middle of the jungle to get them looking and feeling like soldiers lost in a foreign land.\n* [[Steve Coogan]] as Damien Cockburn: The inexperienced British film director who is unable to control the actors in the film. The character was partly inspired by [[Richard Stanley (director)|Richard Stanley]], and his experience of directing the 1996 film ''[[The Island of Dr. Moreau (1996 film)|The Island of Dr. Moreau]]'', with [[Val Kilmer]] and [[Marlon Brando]].\n* [[Jay Baruchel]] as Kevin Sandusky: A novice actor, he is the only cast member to have read the script and book and attended the assigned [[Recruit training|boot camp]] prior to the film. Sandusky plays a young soldier named Brooklyn in the film-within-a-film. Brooklyn and Sandusky each occupy the position of [[straight man]] in character in the film-within-a-film and its cast, being the only actor without an internal conflict or deep-seated insecurity. He often serves as a mediator when tensions between the cast get high.\n* [[Danny McBride]] as Cody Underwood: The film's explosives expert and helicopter pilot. He has developed a reputation for being a dangerous [[pyromania]]c after an incident while working on [[Freaky Friday (2003 film)|Freaky Friday]] nearly blinded [[Jamie Lee Curtis]].\n* [[Brandon T. Jackson]] as Alpa Chino: A closeted homosexual rapper who is attempting to cross over into acting, portraying a soldier named Motown, while promoting his \"Bust-A-Nut\" candy bar and \"Booty Sweat\" energy drink. He feels his image as a rapper would not allow him to be openly gay.

Stiller wanted to make a film based on the actors he knew who, after taking part in boot camps to prepare for war film roles, became \"self-important\" and \"self-involved\" and appeared to believe they had been part of a real military unit.<ref name=\"FakeBoot\" /><ref name=\"HollySpo\" />\n\nCo-writer Theroux revealed that the initial script concept was to have actors go to a mock boot camp and return with [[posttraumatic stress disorder]].<ref name=\"DVDCommPTSD\" /> The final script was developed to satirize [[Vietnam War in film|Vietnam War films]] such as ''[[Apocalypse Now]]'', ''[[Rambo (film series)|Rambo]]'', ''[[Missing in Action (film)|Missing in Action]]'', ''[[Platoon (film)|Platoon]]'', ''[[Full Metal Jacket]]'', ''[[Hamburger Hill]]'', and ''[[The Deer Hunter]]''.<ref name=\"TelegraphReviewDeer\" /><ref name=\"MitchellFilms\" /> Theroux pointed out that since viewers had an increased awareness of the inner workings of Hollywood due to celebrity websites and Hollywood news sources, the script was easier to write.<ref name=\"HollySpo\" /> Dialogue for unscripted portions of the storyboard was developed on set by the actors or was improvised.<ref name=\"DVDCommImprovise\" />\n\n===Casting===\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| image1 = Robert Downey Jr 2014 Comic Con (cropped).jpg\n| width1 = 125\n| alt1 = A white man with a thin beard, wearing a suit, and looking to his right, smiling.\n| caption1 =\n| image2 = DowneyKirkLazarusTTCostume.jpg\n| width2 = 136\n| alt2 = A film screenshot showing the same man wearing extensive makeup to appear as an African American.\n| caption2 =\n| footer = Downey shown with his character Kirk Lazarus, himself in character as Lincoln Osiris.

Instead, Cruise suggested adding a studio head character, and the idea was incorporated into the script. Stiller and Cruise worked together to create the new character, Les Grossman, as a middle-aged businessman. The role required that Cruise don a [[fatsuit]], large prosthetic hands, and a bald cap.<ref name=\"TrailerEddie\" /><ref name=\"AustMate\" /> It was Cruise's idea to give the character large hands and dance to \"[[Low (Flo Rida song)|Low]]\".<ref name=\"CruiseHandLow\" /> Stiller intended to keep Cruise's role a secret until the film's release. In addition, [[Paramount Pictures]] refused to release promotional pictures of Cruise's character to the media.<ref name=\"cieply\" /> In November 2007, images of Cruise wearing a bald headpiece and a fatsuit appeared on ''[[Inside Edition]]'', as well as on the Internet.<ref name=\"FatSuitTom\" /><ref name=\"PeopleCameo\" /> Cruise's attorneys threatened a lawsuit if photos showing Cruise in costume were published.<ref name=\"ninemsn\" /> They approached various sites that were hosting the image and quickly had it removed.<ref name=\"SpoilSurprise\" /> A representative for Cruise stated: \"Mr. Cruise's appearance was supposed to be a surprise for his fans worldwide.

After filming was completed, it was deemed the largest production filmed on the island to date, and contributed more than $60 million to the local economy.<ref name=\"SoCal\" /><ref name=\"CutsImpact\" /> Tim Ryan, the executive editor of ''Hawaii Film & Video Magazine'', commented on the filming on the island: \"I think ''Tropic Thunder'' will give Kaua'i much needed and long idled publicity in the production arena ...&nbsp;It should put Kaua'i back on the production consideration radar.\"<ref name=\"GardenIsland\" /> Preliminary production crews were on the island starting in December 2006 and [[principal photography]] began in July 2007, with filming lasting thirteen&nbsp;weeks over seven&nbsp;separate locations on the island.<ref name=\"GardenIsland\" /><ref name=\"StillerVogue\" /> Much of the filming took place on private land as well as [[habitat conservation|conservation status]] designated areas.<ref name=\"CutsImpact\" /> Casting calls on the island sought 500 residents to portray the villagers in the film.<ref name=\"GardenIsland\" /> Two units shot simultaneously on the island from the ground, and an aerial unit shot from helicopters.<ref name=\"JohnTreks\" /> Many of the sets and the bridge used for one of the final scenes were built in three months.<ref name=\"DVDCommSets3\" /> The island's erratic weather hampered filming with rain and lighting issues.<ref name=\"DVDCommRain\" /><ref name=\"DVDCommLight\" /> The crew also faced complications in moving the equipment and cast due to the difficult terrain.<ref name=\"JohnKodak\" />\n\nThe film advising company [[Dale Dye|Warriors Inc.]] was enlisted to ensure the war scenes, including the attire worn by the actors, looked authentic.

These were at times altered weekly due to the reactions of test audiences in screenings.<ref name=\"VFXTT\" /> CIS Visual Effects Group assisted with the ''Scorcher VI'' faux trailer and twenty additional shots for the home media release.<ref name=\"VFXTDVD\" /> To expand on the comedy in the film, some of the explosions and crashes were embellished to look more destructive. The visual effects supervisor Michael Fink reflected on the exaggerated explosions: \"We worked really hard to make the [[Computer-generated imagery|CG]] crashing helicopter in the hot landing sequence look real. Ben was adamant about that, but at the same time he wanted the explosion to be huge. When you see it hit the ground, it was like it was filled with gasoline! It was the same thing with Ben's sergeant character, who almost intercepts a hand grenade&nbsp;...
