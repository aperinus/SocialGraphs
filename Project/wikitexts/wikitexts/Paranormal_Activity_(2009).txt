It centers on a young couple ([[Katie Featherston]] and [[Micah Sloat]]) who are haunted by a supernatural presence in their home. They then set up a camera to document what is haunting them. The film utilizes [[Found footage (film technique)|found-footage]] conventions that were mirrored in the later films of the series.\n\nOriginally developed as an [[Independent film|independent feature]] and given film festival screenings in 2007, the film was shot for $15,000. It was then acquired by [[Paramount Pictures]] and modified, particularly with a new ending that cost an additional $200,000. It was given a limited U.S. release on September 25, 2009, and then a nationwide release on October 16, 2009. The film earned nearly $108 million at the U.S. box office and a further $85 million internationally for a worldwide total of $193 million.<ref name=\"thenumbers\" /> Paramount/DreamWorks acquired the U.S. rights for $350,000.

A parallel sequel, ''[[Paranormal Activity 2]]'', was released in 2010. The success of the first two films would spawn additional films in the series: the prequel ''[[Paranormal Activity 3]]'' in 2011, and sequel to the second film, ''[[Paranormal Activity 4]]'' in 2012. The fifth installment and spin-off, [[Paranormal Activity: The Marked Ones|''The Marked Ones'']], was released in 2014, and the sixth installment, [[Paranormal Activity: The Ghost Dimension|''The Ghost Dimension'']], was released in 2015. A video game, [[Paranormal Activity (franchise)#Video game|''The Lost Soul'']], was released in 2017, while a seventh film, [[Paranormal Activity: Next of Kin|''Next of Kin'']], was released in 2021.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Please, only add to this synopsis if you spot a mistake or grammatical error. WP:FILMPLOT has a word limit of 400-700 for plot sections of film articles. -->\nYoung couple Katie and Micah move to a new house in [[San Diego]]. Katie claims an evil presence has been haunting her since she was a child, so Micah sets up a camera in their bedroom to record any paranormal activity that occurs while they sleep. Katie visits [[psychic]] Dr. Fredrichs, who suggests Katie is being haunted by a [[demon]] that feeds off of negative energy and is intent on tormenting her. He advises not to communicate with the demon without a [[Demonology|demonologist]], but Micah continues to film and seek it out.\n\nThe camera captures many strange occurrences during the night; they start off as minor noises, flickering lights, and bedroom door movements, but over time escalate into violent door slamming, loud thuds, and demonic grunts and screeches. One night, Katie appears to be in a trance; she gets up, stands beside the bed staring at Micah for two hours, and goes outside, none of which she recalls the next day.\n\nMicah brings home a [[Ouija board]]. When the couple leave the house, the camera records an unseen force moving the board's pointer on its surface, which then spontaneously catches fire. Katie is increasingly aggravated by Micah's flippant behavior and pleads to contact the demonologist, but he refuses. The couple find non-human footsteps on [[baby powder]] Micah sprinkled in the hallway; its path leads to a burnt photograph of a young Katie in the attic, thought to have been destroyed in a house fire. Outside intervention is unavailable, as the demonologist is out of the country and Dr. Fredrichs is afraid of making the demon angrier. That night, Katie is pulled out of the bedroom by an unseen force. Micah discovers a bite mark on Katie's back the morning after, motivating him to get out of the house, but Katie abruptly insists on staying.\n\nOn night twenty-one, Katie gets out of bed again and stares at Micah for two hours before going downstairs. Katie screams for Micah and he quickly rushes to help her. Afterwards, Micah screams in pain. After a moment of silence, Micah's body is violently hurled at the camera which is knocked off the tripod, revealing Katie standing in the doorway with blood on her shirt. She crawls to Micah's body, then looks up at the camera with a grin. As she lunges toward the camera, her face takes on a demonic snarl and the scene cuts to black. Epilogue text states Micah's body is discovered by the police, and Katie is missing.\n\n===Alternate endings===\nOnce Paramount acquired the film, the original ending was shown at only one public viewing before being scrapped; two new endings were developed, one theatrically released and the other available as an alternate ending on home releases.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.horrorsquad.com/2009/10/11/so-what-was-paranormal-activitys-original-ending/|title=So What Was 'Paranormal Activity's Original Ending?|last=Goss|first=William|website=Horror Squad|date=2010-01-31|access-date=2010-01-31|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091015123528/http://www.horrorsquad.com/2009/10/11/so-what-was-paranormal-activitys-original-ending/|archive-date=2009-10-15|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cinematical.com/2009/10/09/oren-peli-paranormal-activity-interview/|title=Interview: Oren Peli, Writer-Director of 'Paranormal Activity'|last=Hall|first=Peter|date=2009-10-09|work=Cinematical|access-date=2009-10-23}}</ref>\n\n====Original ending====\nKatie returns to the bedroom alone, covered in blood and holding a large kitchen knife. She sits on the floor against the bed and rocks back and forth. The next day, Katie's friend Amber leaves a concerned message at 2 PM, visits the house at 9 PM, discovers Micah's body downstairs, and runs away in panic. 30 minutes later, two policemen enter the house and reach the bedroom where they find the possessed Katie with the knife. Seeing them, Katie suddenly returns to her normal state and asks about Micah. After the attic door slams by itself, one of the officers panics and shoots and kills her. The camera fades to black as the police officers continue searching the house for the source of the sound. An epilogue text appears dedicating the film to the memory of Micah and Katie.\n\n====Alternate ending====\nAfter killing Micah off-screen, Katie comes back upstairs alone like in the original ending. She closes and locks the bedroom door, approaches the camera and promptly slits her own throat, before collapsing dead. The scene then fades to black.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Katie Featherston]] as Katie\n* [[Micah Sloat]] as Micah\n* Mark Fredrichs as Dr. Fredrichs\n* Amber Armstrong as Amber\n* [[Ashley Palmer (actress)|Ashley Palmer]] as Diane\n\n==Production==\nAttempting to focus on believability rather than action and gore, Peli chose to shoot the picture with a home video camera. In deciding on a more raw and stationary format (the camera was almost always sitting on a tripod or something else) and eliminating the need for a camera crew, a \"higher degree of plausibility\" was created for the audience as they were \"more invested in the story and the characters\".<ref name=\"interview\">{{cite web | url=http://www.shocktillyoudrop.com/news/slamdancenews.php?id=5123 | title=Exclusive Interview: Oren Peli| first=Ryan |last=Turek | date=2008-03-09 | access-date=2008-03-10}}</ref> Peli says that the dialogue was \"natural\" because there was no real script. Instead, the actors were given outlines of the story and situations to improvise, a technique known as \"[[retroscripting]]\" also used in the making of ''[[The Blair Witch Project]]''.<ref name=\"interview\" /> In casting the movie, Peli auditioned \"a few hundred people\" before finally meeting Katie Featherston and Micah Sloat. He originally auditioned them individually and later called them back to audition together. Peli was impressed with the chemistry between the actors, saying, \"If you saw the [audition] footage, you would've thought they had known each other for years.\"<ref name=\"interview\" /> During a guest appearance on ''[[The Jay Leno Show]]'' on November 3, 2009, Sloat and Featherston explained they each saw the casting call on LACasting.

Sloat, who controlled the camera for a good deal of the film, was a former cameraman at his university's TV station. \"It was a very intense week\", Peli said, stating that the film would be shot day and night, edited at the same time, and would have the visual effects applied to it as the acting footage was being finalized.<ref name=\"interview\" /> Multiple endings were conceived, but not all of them were shot.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://popwatch.ew.com/2009/10/30/paranormal-activity-three-super-scary-alternate-endings-spoiler-alert/|title='Paranormal Activity': Three super-scary alternate endings (SPOILER ALERT!)|last=Schwartz|first=Missy|magazine=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|date=2009-10-30|access-date=2014-06-03}}</ref>\n\nThe film was screened at 2007's [[Screamfest Horror Film Festival]], where it impressed an assistant at the [[Creative Artists Agency]], Kirill Baru, so much that CAA signed on to represent Peli. Attempting to find a distributor for the film and/or directing work for Peli, the agency sent out DVDs of the movie to as many people in the industry as they could, and it was eventually seen by [[Miramax Films]] Senior Executive Jason Blum, who thought it had potential. He worked with Peli to re-edit the film and submitted it to the [[Sundance Film Festival]], but it was rejected. The DVD also impressed [[DreamWorks Pictures|DreamWorks]] executives Adam Goodman, Stacey Snider, and finally [[Steven Spielberg]], who cut a deal with Blum and Peli.<ref name=\"latimes\" />\n\nDreamWorks' plan was to remake the film with a bigger budget and with Peli directing, and only to include the original version as an extra when the DVD was eventually released. \"They didn't know what to do with [the original]\", said Blum; they just wanted to be \"in business\" with Peli.<ref name=\"latimes\" /> Blum and Peli agreed, but stipulated a test screening of the original film before going ahead with the remake, believing it would be well received by a theatrical audience.<ref name=\"latimes\" />\n\nDuring the screening, people began walking out; Goodman thought the film was [[Box office bomb|bombing]], until he learned that the viewers were actually leaving because they were so frightened.
