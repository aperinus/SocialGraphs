It was adapted and directed by [[John Huston]] and starred [[Sean Connery]], [[Michael Caine]], [[Saeed Jaffrey]] and [[Christopher Plummer]] as Kipling (giving a name to the novella's anonymous narrator). The film follows two rogue ex-soldiers, former [[non-commissioned officer]]s in the [[British Army]], who set off from late 19th century [[British India]] in search of adventure and end up in faraway [[Kafiristan]], where one is taken for a god and made their king.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1885 in India, while working late at night in his newspaper office, the journalist [[Rudyard Kipling]] is approached by a ragged, seemingly crazed derelict who reveals himself to be Peachy Carnehan, an old acquaintance. Carnehan tells Kipling the story of how he and his comrade-in-arms [[Daniel Dravot|Danny Dravot]], ex-sergeants of the British Army who had become adventurers, travelled far beyond India into the remote land of [[Kafiristan]].\n\nThree years earlier, Dravot and Carnehan had met Kipling under less than auspicious circumstances. After stealing Kipling's pocket-watch, Carnehan found a masonic tag on the chain, and realising he had robbed a fellow [[Freemason]], felt he had to return it. At the time, he and Dravot were working on a plot to blackmail a local [[raja]], which Kipling foiled by getting the British district commissioner to intervene. In a comic relief turn, Carnehan obliquely blackmails the commissioner in order to avoid deportation.\n\nFrustrated at the lack of opportunities for lucrative criminal mischief, in an India becoming more civilised and regulated\u2014partly through their own hard efforts as soldiers\u2014and with little to look forward to in the [[United Kingdom]] except dreary, poorly paid jobs, the two turn up at Kipling's office with an audacious plan. Forsaking India, they will head with twenty rifles and ammunition to Kafiristan, a country virtually unknown to Europeans since its conquest by [[Alexander the Great]]. There they will offer their services to a ruler and then help him to conquer his neighbours, but proceed to overthrow him and loot the country. Kipling, after first trying to dissuade them, gives Dravot his masonic tag as a token of brotherhood.\n\nAfter signing a contract pledging mutual loyalty and forswearing women and drink, the two set off on an epic overland journey north beyond the [[Khyber Pass]]. Over the next few weeks, they travel through [[Afghanistan]], fighting off bandits, blizzards and avalanches, as they make their way into the unknown land of Kafiristan. They chance upon a [[Gurkha]] soldier, Billy Fish, the sole survivor of a years past, British expedition. Speaking English as well as the local language, Billy smooths their way as they begin their rise, first offering their services to the chief of a much-raided village. When a force has been trained in modern weapons and tactics, they lead it out against some hated neighbours. During the battle, an arrow pierces Dravot's jacket but he is unharmed.\n\nBoth sides take him to be a god, though in fact the arrowhead was stopped by his leather [[bandolier]]. Victory follows victory, with the defeated adding to the ranks of the swelling army. With their enemies vanquished, nobody is left to stand in their way, as they are summoned to the holy city of Sikandergul by the high priest of the region. He sets up a re-enactment of the arrow incident, to determine whether Dravot is a man or a god by seeing whether or not he bleeds. When his shirt is torn open, they are amazed to see the masonic tag around his neck. It contains the sacred symbol left by Sikander, their name for Alexander the Great, who had promised to send a son to rule over them.\n\nHailing Dravot as king as well as god, they show him the royal treasury, which is full of unimaginable amounts of gold and jewels that are now all his. Carnehan suggests that they leave with as much loot as they can carry as soon as the snows have melted on the mountain passes. Dravot, however, is beginning to enjoy the adulation of the locals, settling their disputes and issuing laws, and even dreams of visiting Queen [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Victoria]] as an equal. He is also struck by the beauty of a girl called [[Roxana|Roxane]], the name of Alexander's wife, and cancels their pact to avoid women, saying he will marry her in order to leave the people an heir. When she is reluctantly brought to him, he tries to kiss her, but she, terrified that the touch of a god means death to a mortal, bites his cheek. Seeing him bleed, the people realise he is only human and try to grab the British impostors.\n\nOutnumbered in the ensuing battle, Dravot is captured and is made to walk onto a rope bridge, where he lustily sings the hymn \"[[The Son of God Goes Forth to War]]\". When the ropes are cut, he falls thousands of feet to his death. Carnehan is crucified between two pine trees, but upon being found still alive the next morning, is freed. Crippled in body and unhinged in mind from his ordeal, he eventually makes his way back to India as a beggar. Finishing his story, he leaves Kipling's office after putting a bundle on the desk. When Kipling opens it, he finds Dravot's skull, still wearing a golden crown.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Sean Connery]] as [[Daniel Dravot]]\n* [[Michael Caine]] as Peachy Carnehan\n* [[Christopher Plummer]] as [[Rudyard Kipling]]\n* [[Saeed Jaffrey]] as Billy Fish\n* [[Shakira Caine]] as Roxanne\n* [[Larbi Doghmi|Doghmi Larbi]] as Ootah\n* [[Jack May]] as District Commissioner\n* Karroom Ben Bouih as Kafu Selim\n* Mohammad Shamsi as Babu\n* [[Albert Moses]] as Ghulam\n* Paul Antrim as Mulvaney\n* Graham Acres as Officer\n* PJ Retiree as Chief\n* The Blue Dancers of Goulamine as Dancers\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n''The Man Who Would Be King'' had been a pet project of John Huston's for decades after he had read the book as a child.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cliomuse.com/the-man-who-would-be-king.html|title=The Man Who Would be King director: John Huston|website=Cliomuse}}</ref> Huston had planned to make the film since the 1950s, originally with [[Clark Gable]] and [[Humphrey Bogart]] in the roles of Daniel and Peachy.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8h9vDpK88s TimesTalks: Michael Caine: Five Favorite Films | The New York Times] on ''YouTube''</ref> He was unable to get the project off the ground before Bogart died in 1957; Gable followed in 1960.

A key song, which figures within the plot of the movie, is a fusion of the music of the Irish song \"[[The Minstrel Boy]]\" with the lyrics of [[Reginald Heber]]'s \"[[The Son of God Goes Forth to War]]\". This song is heard at key moments in the score, notably being sung by Dravot as he is being executed and as he tumbles to his death.
