Cohen]] from [[Stephen King]]'s [[It (novel)|1986 novel of the same name]]. The story revolves around a predatory [[monster]] that can [[shapeshifting|transform itself]] into its prey's worst fears, allowing it to exploit the phobias of its victims. It mostly takes the humanoid form of [[It (character)|Pennywise]], a darkly comedic [[clown]]. The protagonists are The Lucky Seven, or The Losers Club, a group of outcast kids who discover Pennywise and vow to kill him by any means necessary. The series takes place over two different time periods, the first when the Losers first confront Pennywise as children in 1960, and the second when they return as adults in 1990 to defeat him a second time after he resurfaces.\n\nCast members included [[Tim Curry]] (Pennywise), [[Richard Thomas (actor)|Richard Thomas]], [[John Ritter]], [[Harry Anderson]], and others. Produced by Green/Epstein Productions, ''It'' was filmed over a period of three months in [[New Westminster, British Columbia]] in mid-1990 with a budget of $12 million, double the usual television budget. The miniseries was first broadcast during the November [[Nielsen ratings#Sweeps|sweeps month]]. Despite the risk factors, mixed pre-airing critical reviews, and coverage of [[President of the United States|President]] [[George H. W. Bush]]'s foreign trips cutting into the program; ''It'' was ABC's biggest success of 1990, pulling through with 30 million viewers for its two parts.\n\n''It'' was nominated for two [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Music Composition for a Miniseries, Movie, or a Special|Emmy Award]]s, one [[Eddie Award]], one [[Young Artist Award|Youth in Film]] award, and a best miniseries recognition from the [[People's Choice Awards]]; it won two of the nominations, an [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Music Composition for a Limited Series, Movie, or Special|Emmy Award for Outstanding Music Composition]] for [[Richard Bellis]]' score and an Eddie Award for the miniseries' editing.\n\nWhile divided critical perspectives towards ''It'' have continued in later years, the miniseries has become most known for Curry's version of Pennywise. In fact, his portrayal has been considered by several publications to be one of the scariest clown characters in film and television. ''It'' has also spawned an [[Indiegogo]]-funded [[documentary film]] about the miniseries' production, titled ''Pennywise: The Story of IT'' (2020); and an [[alternate history]] [[short film|sequel short]] named ''Georgie'', also by the producers of the documentary.\n\n==Plot==\nDuring a heavy rainstorm in [[Derry (Stephen King)|Derry, Maine]] in the spring of 1960, George Denbrough plays in the streets with a paper sailboat made by his stuttering older brother, [[Bill Denbrough|Bill]]. It goes down a storm drain, where Georgie encounters [[It (character)|Pennywise the Dancing Clown]]. Pennywise entices Georgie to reach in to retrieve his boat, only to tear his arm off and leave him to bleed to death. A few months later, Bill and asthmatic [[Eddie Kaspbrak]] befriend the chubby new kid [[Ben Hanscom]]. They are later joined by [[Beverly Marsh]], who lives with her abusive father, and she and Ben are introduced to Bill and Eddie's other friends: the comical Richie Tozier and skeptical, Jewish [[Boy Scout|boy scout]] Stan Uris. \n\nBen develops feelings for Beverly, and sends her an anonymous poem, but she has feelings for Bill. At school, by the creek and around town they are all bullied by Henry Bowers and his [[Greaser (subculture)|greaser]] gang. The children all have grotesque, frightening encounters with Pennywise. In July, the group is joined by Mike Hanlon, an African-American boy, as he is chased by Bowers' gang. The children, now dubbing themselves the \"Losers Club\", fend off Bowers gang with rocks. While looking through Mike's History of Derry school project scrapbook, the Losers realize that Pennywise, whom they refer to as \"It\", is not a human being, but rather an ancient creature that awakens every thirty years to hunt and feed.\n\nRealizing that ''It'' killed Georgie, Bill leads the Losers into Derry's sewers to kill the creature. Stan becomes separated from the group and is ambushed by Bowers and Belch Huggins. Belch is killed by It, and Henry is left traumatized, his hair turned white. Stanley regroups with the Losers in a large sewer drainage chamber, which fills with fog as the 7 join hands to form a circle, their united strength but Stan is grabbed by It. The Losers take advantage of It's ability to access their imaginations and use it against him. Eddie imagines his inhaler is full of battery acid, injuring half of the clown's face, then Beverly slingshots silver earrings at It, which seems to 'break' Pennywise's head open, his light force seeping out. Wounded ''It'' flees down a drain, where the kids hear moaning, and conclude ''It'' is dead. The group exits the sewers, but vows to return should ''It'' ever return. Bowers, now incoherent or possessed from ITs deadlights confesses to the child killings and is institutionalized.\n\nThirty years later in May 1990, It kills a little girl in her backyard, signalling another awakening and feeding spree. Mike, the only one to stay in Derry, contacts his old friends to fulfill their oath after hearing reports of missing children. All of the Losers, who have gone on to have successful careers, return, except Stan, who commits suicide. The other Losers reunite in Derry, later learning of Stan's suicide. Upon returning, they are all taunted and terrorized by Pennywise. Bowers, with ''ITS'' help, escapes from the asylum to murder the Losers. Bill's British wife, Audra, travels to Derry but is captured by It, hypnotized by the monster's \"Deadlights\". Bowers attacks and stabs Mike, but is fatally stabbed with his own knife when Eddie & Ben rush in. Mike is hospitalized, where he gives Bill the two silver earrings he retrieved from the sewers ten years ago. The five remaining Losers return to the sewers to confront It, where Bill realizes that ''It'' has Audra.\n\nThey reach It's inner sanctum, see the catatonic Audra engulfed in spider webs and discover It's true form of a gigantic, otherworldly spider. Bill, Ben, and Richie are entranced by the Deadlights emanating from ''Its'' underside, while Beverly retrieves the silver earring she overshot. Eddie attempts to repeat the wound he inflicted on It as a child, but is grabbed and mortally wounded. Beverly frees her friends, but Eddie dies. The others follow the injured demon spider, finishing it by ripping out its heart. They remove Eddie's body and the catatonic Audra from the sewers. \nMike recovers in the hospital, explaining how the Losers go their separate ways once again, their memories of It and each other fading over time, save for his journal; Beverly and Ben get married and are expecting their first child, and Richie is cast in a film. Bill is preparing to leave Derry, but pulls Audra out of her catatonia by riding her down a street on \"Silver\" his childhood [[Schwinn]] cruiser.\n\n== Cast and characters ==\n{{blockquote|I was at first a bit intimidated by my all-star cast, but my fears were unfounded \u2013 they all turned out to be generous and supportive team players.
