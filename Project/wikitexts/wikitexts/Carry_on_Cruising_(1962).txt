It was based on an original story by [[Eric Barker]]. [[P&O Cruises|P&O \u2013 Orient Lines]] were thanked in the credits. Regulars [[Sid James]], [[Kenneth Williams]] and [[Kenneth Connor]] appear in the film, whereas [[Joan Sims]] and [[Charles Hawtrey (actor, born 1914)|Charles Hawtrey]] do not. Sims took ill shortly before filming began and was replaced by [[Dilys Laye]], making her ''Carry On'' debut, at four days' notice. Hawtrey was dropped for demanding star billing,  but returned for the next entry, making this the only entry during Hawtrey's 23-film run which he missed. Sims returned two years later in ''[[Carry On Cleo]]''. [[Liz Fraser]] notches up the second of her four appearances here. [[Lance Percival]] makes his only appearance in the series in ''Carry On Cruising'', playing the ship's chef, the role originally designated for Hawtrey. The Australian actor [[Vincent Ball]] also makes his first, of two, ''Carry On'' appearances. This was the last film to have its screenplay written by [[Norman Hudis]]. This film was notable for being the first in the series to be filmed in colour.\n\n==Plot==\nCaptain Crowther ([[Sid James]]) has five of his crew replaced at short notice before a new cruise voyage begins. Not only does he get the five most incompetent crew men ever to sail the seven seas, but the passengers turn out to be a rather strange bunch too.\n\nThe SS ''Happy Wanderer'' is the cruise ship and after this voyage, Crowther hopes to get a job as captain on a transatlantic ship, promising the crew members their jobs will be safe under the new captain.  Starting off from England, the ''Happy Wanderer'' calls at unnamed ports in [[Spanish State|Spain]], Italy and North Africa before going home again.\n\nSingle ladies Gladys ([[Liz Fraser]]) and Flo ([[Dilys Laye]]) take the cruise, with Flo hoping to find a husband. Bridget ([[Esma Cannon]]) is her usual dotty and entertaining self, and one unnamed passenger ([[Ronnie Stevens (actor)|Ronnie Stevens]]) never disembarks but always goes straight to the bar to drink, to forget an unidentified woman. The crew and passengers settle in as the ship leaves port and head chef Wilfred Haines ([[Lance Percival]]) finds out he is seasick. [[Mario Fabrizi]] makes a quick appearance as one of the cooks under Haines. [[Ed Devereaux]], best known for the part of Matt Hammond in the Australian TV series 'Skippy', appears as a Young Officer.\n\nGladys and Flo fall for the PT instructor Mr Jenkins but nothing comes of it, especially when Flo turns out to be hopeless in the gym. Meanwhile, the new men try to impress Crowther but disaster follows disaster with him getting knocked out and covered in food at a party.\n\nMeanwhile, ship's doctor Dr. Binn ([[Kenneth Connor]]) has fallen for Flo, but she wants nothing to do with him so he serenades her with a song after leaving Italy (''Bella Marie'', sung by Roberto Cardinali), which she does not hear as she is asleep. Gladys, who has heard the song, realises that Flo is in love with Binn and with the help of First Officer Marjoribanks ([[Kenneth Williams]]) arranges a plot for Binn and Flo to get together. It works and the confident Binn finally confesses his feelings to a gobsmacked Flo, who returns his affections.\n\nCrowther lets the five newcomers know that they have improved since the cruise began, simply by doing their jobs and not by trying to impress him. They learn that the Captain has been in charge of the ''Happy Wanderer'' for ten years and decide to hold a surprise party for him, with the passengers. Haines bakes him a many-flavoured cake and the barman cables the former barman for the recipe of the Captain's favourite drink, the ''Aberdeen Angus''.\n\nThe party goes well and Crowther gets his telegram telling him he has the captaincy of the new ship. He turns it down as he recognises it does not have the personal touch of a cruise ship, and prefers the company of his own crew.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Sid James]] as Captain Wellington Crowther\n*[[Kenneth Williams]] as First Officer Leonard Marjoribanks\n*[[Kenneth Connor]] as Dr Arthur Binn\n*[[Liz Fraser]] as Glad Trimble\n*[[Dilys Laye]] as Flo Castle\n*[[Esma Cannon]] as Bridget Madderley\n*[[Lance Percival]] as Wilfred Haines, Ship's Cook.\n*[[Jimmy Thompson (actor)|Jimmy Thompson]] as Sam Turner\n*[[Ronnie Stevens (actor)|Ronnie Stevens]] as Drunk\n*[[Vincent Ball]] as Jenkins\n*[[Cyril Chamberlain]] as Tom Tree\n*[[Willoughby Goddard]] as Large Man\n*[[Ed Devereaux]] as Young officer\n*[[Brian Rawlinson]] as Steward\n*[[Anton Rodgers]] as Young man\n*[[Anthony Sagar]] as Cook\n*Terence Holland as Passer-by\n*[[Mario Fabrizi]] as Cook\n*Evan David as Bridegroom\n*Marian Collins as Bride\n*Jill Mai Meredith as Shapely miss\n*Alan Casley as Kindly seaman\n\n==Crew==\n*Screenplay \u2013 [[Norman Hudis]]\n*Story \u2013 [[Eric Barker]]\n*Music \u2013 [[Bruce Montgomery (composer)|Bruce Montgomery]] & [[Douglas Gamley]]\n*Director of Photography \u2013 [[Alan Hume]]\n*Art Director \u2013 [[Carmen Dillon]]\n*Editor \u2013 John Shirley\n*Production Manager \u2013 Bill Hill\n*Camera Operator \u2013 Dudley Lovell\n*Assistant Director \u2013 Jack Causey\n*Sound Editors \u2013 Arthur Ridout & Archie Ludski\n*Sound Recordists \u2013 Robert T MacPhee & Bill Daniels\n*Continuity \u2013 Penny Daniels\n*Make-up \u2013 George Blackler & Geoffrey Rodway\n*Hairdressing \u2013 Biddy Crystal\n*Costume Designer \u2013 Joan Ellacott\n*Casting Director \u2013 Betty White\n*Beachwear \u2013 [[Silhouette (lingerie)]]\n*Producer \u2013 [[Peter Rogers]]\n*Director \u2013 [[Gerald Thomas]]\n\n==Filming and locations==\n*Filming dates \u2013 8 January-16 February 1962\n\n'''Interiors''':\n* [[Pinewood Studios]], Buckinghamshire, England\n\n'''Exteriors'''\n* [[Port of Southampton|Southampton Docks]]\n\n==Reception==\nThe film was the 12th most popular film at the British box office in 1962.<ref>\"Money-Making Films of 1962.\" ''The Times'' [London, England] 4 January 1963: 4.
