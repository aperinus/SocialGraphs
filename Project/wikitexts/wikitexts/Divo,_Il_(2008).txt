It is based on the figure of former Italian Prime Minister [[Giulio Andreotti]]. It competed at the [[2008 Cannes Film Festival|Cannes Film Festival in 2008]], where it was awarded the [[Jury Prize (Cannes Film Festival)|Jury Prize]]. The film also screened at the [[2008 Toronto International Film Festival|Toronto International Film Festival]] and was nominated for the [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] for [[Academy Award for Best Makeup and Hairstyling|Best Makeup]] at the [[82nd Academy Awards]] in 2010.\n\n==Synopsis==\nThe film presents the story of [[Giulio Andreotti]], a seven-time [[Prime Minister of Italy]] notorious for his alleged ties to the [[Sicilian Mafia|Mafia]]. The narration covers Andreotti's seventh election in 1992, his failed bid for the [[President of Italy|presidency of the Italian Republic]], the bribe scandal ''[[Tangentopoli]]'' and his trial in 1995.\n\nAs the film opens, Giulio Andreotti gives an inner monologue observing how he has managed to survive his tumultuous political career while his various detractors have died. A montage shows the murders of various people connected to Andreotti, including journalist [[Mino Pecorelli]], [[Carabinieri]] general [[Carlo Alberto Dalla Chiesa]], bankers [[Michele Sindona]] and [[Roberto Calvi]], and former Prime Minister [[Aldo Moro]].\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Toni Servillo]] as [[Giulio Andreotti]]\n*[[Anna Bonaiuto]] as Livia Danese, Giulio Andreotti's wife\n*[[Flavio Bucci]] as [[Franco Evangelisti (politician)|Franco Evangelisti]]\n*[[Carlo Buccirosso]] as [[Paolo Cirino Pomicino]]\n*[[Piera Degli Esposti]] as Mrs. Enea, Giulio Andreotti's secretary\n*[[Alberto Cracco]] as Don Mario\n*[[Giorgio Colangeli]] as [[Salvo Lima]]\n*[[Massimo Popolizio]] as [[Vittorio Sbardella]]\n*[[Aldo Ralli]] as [[Giuseppe Ciarrapico]]\n*[[Giulio Bosetti]] as [[Eugenio Scalfari]]\n*[[Gianfelice Imparato]] as [[Vincenzo Scotti]]\n*[[Paolo Graziosi]] as [[Aldo Moro]]\n*[[Lorenzo Gioielli]] as [[Mino Pecorelli]]\n*[[Giovanni Vettorazzo]] as Magistrate Scarpinato\n*[[Cristina Serafini]] as Caterina Stagno\n*[[Achille Brugnini]] as [[Fiorenzo Angelini]]\n*[[Pietro Biondi]] as [[Francesco Cossiga]]\n*[[Fanny Ardant]] as French Ambassador's wife\n\n==Soundtrack==\n{{Infobox album\n| name       = Il Divo\n| type       = film score\n| artist     = [[Teho Teardo]]\n| cover      =\n| alt        =\n| released   = 2008\n| recorded   =\n| venue      =\n| studio     =\n| genre      = [[Film music]]\n| length     = 64:21\n| label      = [[Universal Music Group|Universal]]\n| producer   = Teho Teardo\n| prev_title =\n| prev_year  =\n| next_title =\n| next_year  =\n}}\nThe [[film score]] for ''Il Divo'' was composed by [[Teho Teardo]] in 2008 and released on compact disc by [[Universal Music Group|Universal]] in Italy.

Also, the inability to completely distinguish whether Andreotti was or was not affiliated with the Mafia murders conveys the lack of clarity in the mechanics of Italy's government. Andreotti's incumbency reveals the [[pentapartito]], which consisted of five parties ranging from centre-right to centre-left. This coalition formed to prevent a left majority and was able to secure a majority by strategic methods of give and take. By maintaining this system of taking turns, a \"systematic corruption\" formed where parties were no longer driven by the masses, but by their alignments, resulting in \"exchanging resources\".<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Bull|first1=Martin|last2=Rhodes|first2=Martin|title=Between crisis and transition: Italian politics in the 1990s|journal=West European Politics|volume=20|pages=1\u201313|doi=10.1080/01402389708425172|year=1997}}</ref>\n\n==Critical reception==\n''Il Divo'' received mostly positive reviews from critics.
