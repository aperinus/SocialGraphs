Brian later grows up into an idealistic young man who resents the continuing [[Iudaea province|Roman occupation of Judea]]. While listening to Jesus's [[Sermon on the Mount]], Brian becomes infatuated with an attractive young rebel, Judith. His desire for her and hatred of the Romans, further exaggerated by his mother revealing Brian himself is half-Roman, inspire him to join the \"People's Front of Judea\" (PFJ), one of many fractious and bickering [[Zealots|independence movements]] which spend more time fighting each other than they do the Romans.\n\nTo prove himself, Brian is tasked by the PFJ to paint slogans on  [[Roman governor]] [[Pontius Pilate|Pilate]]'s palace, but is interrupted by a [[Centurion|Roman officer]]. The officer however, is more concerned with Brian's appalling grammar and, after correcting the slogan, orders him to write it repeatedly. The next morning, Brian has finished writing out the slogan one hundred times and is subsequently chased away by a separate patrol of [[Legionary|legionaries]], unaware that Brian's act of vandalism had actually been ordered by one of their own Centurions. Brian then participates in an abortive attempt by the PFJ to kidnap Pilate's wife but is captured by the palace guards.\n\nEscaping when the guards suffer paroxysms of laughter over Pilate's speech impediment, Brian winds up trying to blend in among prophets preaching in a busy plaza, repeating fragments of Jesus' sermons. He stops his sermon mid-sentence when some Roman soldiers depart, leaving his small but intrigued audience demanding to know more. Brian grows frantic when people start following him to the mountains, and there they declare him to be the messiah. After spending a night in with Judith, Brian, still naked, discovers an enormous crowd assembled outside his mother's house. Her attempts at dispersing the crowd are rebuffed, so she consents to Brian addressing them. He urges them to think for themselves, but they parrot his words as doctrine.\n\nThe PFJ seeks to exploit Brian's celebrity status by having him minister to a thronging crowd of followers demanding [[Faith healing|miracle cures]]. Brian sneaks out the back, only to be captured by the Romans and is sentenced to [[crucifixion]]. In celebration of Passover, a crowd has assembled outside the palace of Pilate, who offers to pardon a prisoner of their choice. The crowd shouts out names containing the letter \"r\", mocking Pilate's [[rhotacism (speech impediment)|rhotacistic]] speech impediment. Eventually, Judith appears in the crowd and calls for the release of Brian, which the crowd echoes, and Pilate agrees to \"welease Bwian\".<ref name=\"Welease\"/>\n\nHis order is eventually relayed to the guards, but in a scene that parodies the climax of the film ''[[Spartacus (film)|Spartacus]]'', various crucified people all claim to be \"Brian\" so they can be freed and the wrong man is released. Other opportunities for a reprieve for Brian are denied as the PFJ and then Judith praise his martyrdom, while his mother expresses regret for having raised him. Hope is renewed when a crack suicide squad from the \"Judean People's Front\" charges and prompts the Roman soldiers to flee; however, the squad commits mass suicide as a form of political protest. Condemned to a slow and painful death, Brian finds his spirits lifted by his fellow sufferers, who cheerfully sing \"[[Always Look on the Bright Side of Life]].\"<ref>{{cite book |first1=Alan |last1=Parker |first2=Mick |last2=O'Shea |date=2006 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G49bRxbeH1kC&pg=PA106 |title=And Now For Something Completely Digital: The Complete Illustrated Guide to Monty Python CDs and DVDs |publisher=The Disinformation Company|isbn=9781932857313 }}</ref>\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Graham Chapman]] as Brian Cohen (of Nazareth), Biggus Dickus (who has a [[lisp]]), 2nd wise man\n* [[John Cleese]] as Reg, [[High Priest of Israel|High priest]], Centurion of the Yard, Deadly Dirk, Arthur, 1st wise man\n* [[Terry Gilliam]] as Another person further forward (at Mount \u2013 \"Do you hear that?

By coincidence Milligan was visiting his old [[Tunisia campaign|World War II battlefields in Tunisia]] where the film was being made.

Shortly after the release of ''[[Monty Python and the Holy Grail]]'' (1975), Eric Idle flippantly suggested that the title of the Pythons' forthcoming feature would be ''Jesus Christ: Lust for Glory'' (a play on the UK title for the 1970 American film ''[[Patton (film)|Patton]]'').<ref name=\"From Fringe to Flying Circus\">{{cite book |author=Wilmut, Roger |date=1980 |title=From Fringe to Flying Circus |location= London |publisher=Eyre Methuen Ltd |isbn=0-413-46950-6 |pages=247\u2013250}}</ref> This was after he had become frustrated at repeatedly being asked what it would be called, despite the troupe not having given the matter of a third film any consideration. However, they shared a distrust of organised religion, and, after witnessing the critically acclaimed ''Holy Grail''{{'}}s enormous financial turnover, confirming an appetite among the fans for more cinematic endeavours, they began to seriously consider a film lampooning the [[Christianity in the 1st century|New Testament era]] in the same way that ''Holy Grail'' had lampooned [[Arthurian legend]]. All they needed was an idea for a plot. Eric Idle and Terry Gilliam, while promoting ''Holy Grail'' in [[Amsterdam]], had come up with a sketch in which Jesus' cross is falling apart because of the idiotic carpenters who built it and he angrily tells them how to do it correctly. However, after an early [[brainstorming]] stage, and despite being non-believers, they agreed that Jesus was \"definitely a good guy\" and found nothing to mock in his actual teachings: \"He's not particularly funny, what he's saying isn't mockable, it's very decent stuff\", said Idle later.<ref name=\"autobiography\">{{cite book |author=Chapman, Graham |display-authors=4 |author2=Cleese, John |author3=Gilliam, Terry |author4=Idle, Eric |author5=Jones, Terry |author6=Palin, Michael |author7=with McCabe, Bob |date=2003 |title=The Pythons Autobiography by The Pythons |location= London |publisher=Orion Publishing Group |isbn=0-7528-5293-0 |pages=349\u2013387}}</ref> After settling on the name Brian for their new protagonist, one idea considered was that of \"the 13th disciple\".<ref name=\"From Fringe to Flying Circus\" /> The focus eventually shifted to a separate individual born at a similar time and location who would be mistaken for the Messiah, but had no desire to be followed as such.<ref name=\"Bevan\">{{cite news |first=Nathan |last=Bevan |date=5 March 2011 |url=https://www.walesonline.co.uk/lifestyle/showbiz/the-life-times-monty-pythons-1843865 |title=The life and times of Monty Python's Terry Jones |publisher=Western Mail |newspaper=Wales Online |access-date=19 August 2019 }}</ref>\n\n===Writing===\n\nThe first draft of the screenplay, provisionally titled ''The Gospel According to St. Brian'', was ready by Christmas 1976.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Dark Knights & Holy Fools|last=McCabe|first=Bob|publisher=Universe Publishing|year=1999|isbn=0-7893-0265-9|location=New York|pages=77|lccn=98-75217}}</ref> The final pre-production draft was ready in January 1978, following \"a concentrated two-week writing and water-skiing period in [[Barbados]]\".<ref name=\"MONTYPYTHONSCRAPBOOK\">{{cite book |author=Chapman, Graham |display-authors=etal |date=1979 |title=''Monty Python's The Life of Brian/MONTYPYTHONSCRAPBOOK'' |pages=scrapbook p. 4 |no-pp=true|title-link=Monty Python's The Life of Brian/MONTYPYTHONSCRAPBOOK }}</ref> The film would not have been made without Python fan Beatle [[George Harrison]], who set up [[HandMade Films]] to help fund it at a cost of \u00a33&nbsp;million.<ref name=\"grdn\">{{cite news |last1=Barber |first1=Nicholas |title=How George Harrison \u2013 and a very naughty boy \u2013 saved British cinema |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/apr/03/george-harrison-beatle-monty-python-life-of-brian-handmade-studios |access-date=3 April 2019 |newspaper=The Guardian |date=3 April 2019}}</ref> Harrison put up the money for it as he \"wanted to see the movie\"\u2014later described by Terry Jones as the \"world's most expensive cinema ticket.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/oct/30/george-harrison-little-malcolm-handmade|title=Eunarchy in the UK: George Harrison's first movie|first=John|last=Patterson|date=30 October 2011|via=The Guardian}}</ref>\n\nThe original backers\u2014[[EMI Films]] and, particularly, [[Bernard Delfont]]\u2014had been scared off at the last minute by the subject matter.<ref name=\"From Fringe to Flying Circus\" /><ref name=\"grdn\"/> The very last words in the film are: \"I said to him, 'Bernie, they'll never make their money back on this one'\", teasing Delfont for his lack of faith in the project.

Gilliam again contributed two animated sequences (one being the opening credits) and took charge of [[set design]]. However, this did not put an absolute end to their feuding. On the DVD commentary, Gilliam expresses pride in one set in particular, the main hall of [[Antonia Fortress|Pilate's fortress]], which had been designed so that it looked like an ancient synagogue that the Romans had converted by dumping [[Roman architecture|their structural artefacts]] (such as marble floors and columns) on top. He reveals his consternation at Jones for not paying enough attention to it in the [[cinematography]]. Gilliam also worked on the [[Matte (filmmaking)|matte]] paintings, useful in particular for the very first shot of the three wise men against a star-scape and in giving the illusion of the whole of the outside of the fortress being covered in graffiti. Perhaps the most significant contribution from Gilliam was the scene in which Brian accidentally leaps off a high building and lands inside a starship about to engage in an interstellar war. This was done \"in camera\" using a hand-built model starship and miniature pyrotechnics. Gilliam recounted in an interview: \"Well, we didn't know what to do with Brian. He got himself to the top of the tower and we had to rescue him somehow, so I said, 'OK, spaceship for that.' That was purely it.\"<ref>{{cite news |title=Terry Gilliam on making 'Don Quixote,' defending Johnny Depp and making fun of Donald Trump |url=https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/terry-gilliam-on-making-don-quixote-defending-johnny-depp-and-making-fun-of-donald-trump-192028341.html |access-date=10 December 2021 |agency=Yahoo}}</ref>\n\nThe film was shot on location in [[Monastir, Tunisia|Monastir]], [[Tunisia]], which allowed the production to reuse sets from [[Franco Zeffirelli]]'s ''[[Jesus of Nazareth (film)|Jesus of Nazareth]]'' (1977).<ref>{{cite news |author=Ebert, Roger|date=18 June 2004 |title=Monty Python's Life of Brian|publisher=Digital Chicago |url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/monty-pythons-life-of-brian-2004 |access-date=6 November 2006}}</ref> The Tunisian shoot was documented by [[Iain Johnstone]] for his BBC film ''[[The Pythons (film)|The Pythons]]''.

However, a number of them (of varying quality) were shown the following year on the [[Paramount Comedy Channel]] in the UK. The scenes shown included three shepherds discussing sheep and completely missing the arrival of the angel heralding Jesus's birth, which would have been at the very start of the film; a segment showing the attempted kidnap of Pilate's wife (a large woman played by John Case<!--Please don't change \"Case\" to \"Cleese\"; it's not a typo-->) whose escape results in a fistfight; a scene introducing hardline [[Zionist]] Otto, leader of the Judean People's Front (played by Eric Idle) and his men who practise a suicide run in the courtyard; and a brief scene in which Judith releases some birds into the air in an attempt to summon help.

The logo of the Judean People's Front, designed by Terry Gilliam,<ref name=\"immaculate\">{{cite video |date=2007 |title=The Story of Brian |medium=Monty Python's Life of Brian: The Immaculate Edition DVD |publisher= [[Sony Pictures Home Entertainment]]}}</ref> was a [[Star of David]] with a small line added to each point so it resembled a [[swastika]], most familiar in the West as the symbol of the anti-Semitic Nazi movement. The rest of this faction also all had the same thin moustaches, and wore a spike on their helmets, similar to those on [[Pickelhaube|Imperial German helmets]]. The official reason for the cutting was that Otto's dialogue slowed down the narrative. However, Gilliam, writing in ''The Pythons Autobiography by The Pythons'', said he thought it should have stayed, saying \"Listen, we've alienated the Christians, let's get the Jews now.\" Idle himself was said to have been uncomfortable with the character; \"It's essentially a pretty savage attack on rabid Zionism, suggesting it's rather akin to Nazism, which is a bit strong to take, but certainly a point of view.\"<ref name=\"autobiography\" /> [[Michael Palin]]'s personal journal entries from the period when various edits of ''Brian'' were being test-screened consistently reference the Pythons' and filmmakers' concerns that the Otto scenes were slowing the story down and thus were top of the list to be chopped from the final cut of the film.<ref name=\"autogenerated1969\" /> However, [[Oxford Brookes University]] historian David Nash says the removal of the scene represented \"a form of self-censorship\" and the Otto sequence \"which involved a character representative of extreme forms of [[Zionism]]\" was cut \"in the interests of smoothing the way for the film's distribution in America.\"<ref>{{cite book |last=Nash |first=David |title=Blasphemy in the Christian World: A History |publisher=Oxford University Press |date=2007 |page=214 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OIA_i8jviucC&pg=PA214 |access-date=18 May 2010 |isbn=978-0-19-925516-0}}</ref>\n\nThe only scene with Otto that remains in the film is during the [[crucifixion]] sequence. Otto arrives with his \"crack suicide squad\", sending the Roman soldiers fleeing in terror. Instead of doing anything useful, they \"attack\" by committing mass suicide in front of the cross (\"Zat showed 'em, huh?\" says the dying Otto, to which Brian despondently replies \"You silly sods!\"), ending Brian's hope of rescue (they do however show some signs of life during the famous rendition of \"[[Always Look on the Bright Side of Life]]\" when they are seen waving their toes in unison in time to the music). Terry Jones once mentioned that the only reason this excerpt was not cut too was due to [[continuity (fiction)|continuity]] reasons, as their dead bodies were very prominently placed throughout the rest of the scene.

Much of this material was first printed in the ''[[Monty Python's The Life of Brian / Monty Python Scrapbook]]'' that accompanied the original script publication of ''The Life of Brian'' and then subsequently reused. The song \"[[All Things Dull and Ugly]]\" and the parody scripture reading \"Martyrdom of St. Victor\" were performed on ''[[Monty Python's Contractual Obligation Album]]'' (1980). The idea of a violent rugby match between school masters and small boys was filmed in ''[[Monty Python's The Meaning of Life]]'' (1983). A sketch about a boy who dies at school appeared on the unreleased ''[[The Hastily Cobbled Together for a Fast Buck Album]]'' (1981).\n\n==Soundtrack==\n{{main|Monty Python's Life of Brian (album)}}\nAn album was also released by Monty Python in 1979 in conjunction with the film. In addition to the \"[[Brian Song]]\"  and \"[[Always Look on the Bright Side of Life]]\", it contains scenes from the film with brief linking sections performed by Eric Idle and Graham Chapman. The album opens with a brief rendition of \"[[Hava Nagila]]\" on Scottish bagpipes. A CD version was released in 1997.\n\nAn album of the songs sung in ''[[Monty Python's Life of Brian (album)|Monty Python's Life of Brian]]'' was released on the Disky label. \"Always Look on the Bright Side of Life\" was later re-released with great success, after being sung by British [[Association football|football]] fans. Its popularity became truly evident in 1982 during the [[Falklands War]] when sailors aboard the destroyer [[HMS Sheffield (D80)|HMS ''Sheffield'']], severely damaged in an Argentinean [[Exocet]] missile attack on 4 May, started singing it while awaiting rescue.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.icons.org.uk/nom/nominations/always-look-on-the-bright-side-of-life|title=Icons of England, \"Always Look on the Bright Side of Life\"|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717050535/http://www.icons.org.uk/nom/nominations/always-look-on-the-bright-side-of-life|archive-date=17 July 2011|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>\n{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/columnists/ben_macintyre/article2835095.ece|title=Always look on the bright side of strife: The sardonic humour of war|work=The Times |location=UK |date=9 November 2007 | access-date=5 April 2010 | first=Ben | last=MacIntyre}}</ref> Many people have come to see the song as a life-affirming ode to [[optimism]].

It consisted mostly of stock travelogue footage and featured arch comments from Cleese. For instance, a shot of Bulgarian girls in ceremonial dresses was accompanied by the comment \"Hard to believe, isn't it, that these simple happy folk are dedicated to the destruction of Western Civilisation as we know it!\", [[Communist Bulgaria]] being a member of the [[Warsaw Pact]] at the time. Not only was this a spoof of travelogues ''per se'', it was a protest against the then common practice in Britain of showing cheaply made banal short features before a main feature.\n\n''Life of Brian'' opened on 17 August 1979 in five North American theatres and grossed US$140,034 ($28,007 per screen) in its opening weekend.

Perhaps more importantly still, the film was shunned by the BBC and ITV, who declined to show it for fear of offending Christians in the UK.

Many Christian protesters said that it was mocking Jesus' suffering by turning it into a \"Jolly Boys Outing\" (such as when Mr Cheeky turns to Brian and says: \"See, not so bad once you're up!\"), capped by Brian's fellow sufferers suddenly bursting into song. This is reinforced by the fact that several characters throughout the film claim crucifixion is not as bad as it seems. For example, when Brian asks his cellmate in prison what will happen to him, he replies: \"Oh, you'll probably get away with crucifixion\". In another example, Matthias, an old man who works with the People's Front of Judea, dismisses crucifixion as \"a doddle\" and says being stabbed would be worse.\n\nThe director, Terry Jones, issued the following riposte to this criticism: \"Any religion that makes a form of torture into an icon that they worship seems to me a pretty sick sort of religion quite honestly.\"<ref name=\"Channel 4\" /> The Pythons also pointed out that crucifixion was a standard form of execution in ancient times and not just one especially reserved for Jesus.<ref>{{cite book |title=Ancient Jewish and Christian Perceptions of Crucifixion |first=David W. |last=Chapman |page=44 |publisher=Mohr Siebeck |date=2008 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EdbdQ-5fMr0C |isbn=978-3-16-149579-3}}</ref>\n\n===Responses from the cast===\nShortly after the film was released, Cleese and Palin engaged in a [[Friday Night, Saturday Morning#Monty Python's Life of Brian|debate]] on the [[BBC Two|BBC2]] discussion programme ''[[Friday Night, Saturday Morning]]'' with [[Malcolm Muggeridge]] and [[Mervyn Stockwood]], the [[Anglican Bishop of Southwark|Bishop of Southwark]], who put forward arguments against the film. Muggeridge and Stockwood, it was later claimed, had arrived 15 minutes late to see a screening of the picture prior to the debate, missing the establishing scenes demonstrating that Brian and Jesus were two different characters, and hence contended that it was a send-up of Christ himself.<ref name=\"autobiography\" /> Both Pythons later felt that there had been a strange role reversal in the manner of the debate, with two young upstart comedians attempting to make serious, well-researched points, while the Establishment figures engaged in cheap jibes and point scoring. They also expressed disappointment in Muggeridge, whom all in Python had previously respected as a satirist (he had recently converted to Christianity after meeting [[Mother Teresa]] and experiencing what he described as a miracle). Cleese stated that his reputation had \"plummeted\" in his eyes, while Palin commented, \"He was just being Muggeridge, preferring to have a very strong contrary opinion as opposed to none at all.\"<ref name=\"autobiography\" /> Muggeridge's verdict on the film was that it was \"Such a tenth-rate film that it couldn't possibly destroy anyone's genuine faith.\" In a 2013 interview on [[BBC Radio 4]], Cleese stated that having recently watched the discussion again he \"was astonished, first of all, at how stupid [the two members of the Church] were, and how boring the debate became\". He added: \"I think the sad thing was that there was absolutely no attempt at a proper discussion \u2013 no attempt to find any common ground.\"<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/av/entertainment-arts-25464820/cleese-and-palin-relive-the-1979-life-of-brian-debate |date=30 December 2013 |title=Cleese and Palin relive the 1979 Life of Brian debate |work=BBC News |access-date=5 September 2019 }}</ref>\n\n{{Quote box|width=29%|align=right|quote=\"We always stated Brian wasn't blasphemous, but heretical.

[[Stephen Green (Christian Voice)|Stephen Green]], the head of Christian Voice, insisted that \"You don't promote Christ to the community by taking the mick out of him.\" The Reverend Jonathan Adams, one of the church's clergy, defended his taste in comedy, saying that it did not mock Jesus, and that it raised important issues about the hypocrisy and stupidity that can affect religion.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article1343479.ece|title=Strife of Brian|work=The Times |location=UK |date=7 February 2007 |access-date=5 April 2010}}</ref> Again on the film's DVD commentary, Cleese also spoke up for religious people who have come forward and congratulated him and his colleagues on the film's highlighting of double standards among purported followers of their own faith.<ref name=\"autobiography\" />\n\nSome bans continued into the 21st century.

The infighting among revolutionary organisations is demonstrated most dramatically when the PFJ attempts to kidnap Pontius Pilate's wife, but encounters agents of the Campaign for a Free Galilee, and the two factions begin a violent brawl over which of them conceived of the plan first. When Brian exhorts them to cease their fighting to struggle \"against the common enemy,\" the revolutionaries stop and cry in unison, \"the Judean People's Front!\" However, they soon resume their fighting and, with two Roman legionaries watching bemusedly, continue until Brian is left the only survivor, at which point he is captured.\n\nOther scenes have the freedom fighters wasting time in debate, with one of the debated items being that they should not waste their time debating so much. There is also a famous scene in which Reg gives a revolutionary speech asking, \"What have the Romans ever done for us?\" at which point the listeners outline all forms of positive aspects of the Roman occupation such as [[sanitation]], medicine, education, wine, [[public order]], [[irrigation]], roads, a [[fresh water]] system, [[public health]] and [[peace]], followed by \"what have the Romans ever done for us except sanitation, medicine, education...\".

The resistance fighters leave the [[Sermon on the Mount]], which was a literal recital, angry because Jesus was too pacifistic for them. (\"Well, blessed is just about everyone with a vested interest in the status quo\u2026\")<ref>cf. Tatum, p. 157</ref> In addition to the respectful depiction of Jesus, the film does not state that there is no God or that Jesus is not the son of God. The appearance of a leper, who says he was healed by Jesus, is in line with the [[Gospels]] and their reports about Jesus performing miracles.<ref>cf. Tatum, pp. 151\u2013162</ref>\n\nAny direct reference to Jesus disappears after the introductory scenes, yet his life story partially acts as a framework and subtext for the story of Brian. Brian being a bastard of a Roman centurion could refer to the [[polemic]] legend that Jesus was the son of the Roman soldier [[Tiberius Julius Abdes Pantera|Panthera]]. Disguised as a prophet, Brian talks about \"the lilies on the field\" and states more clearly, \"Don't pass judgment on other people or else you might get judged yourself\": Brian incoherently repeats statements he heard from Jesus.<ref>cf. Tatum, p. 158</ref>\n\nAnother significant figure in the film who is named in the Gospels is [[Pontius Pilate]], who is humorously given [[Rhotacism (speech impediment)|rhotacism]]. Although there is a hint to [[Barabbas]] prior to the crucifixion, no character in ''Life of Brian'' bears any resemblances to [[Judas]] or [[Caiaphas]]. An anti-Semitic interpretation of the story is therefore excluded, according to scholars.<ref>cf. Tatum, p. 153</ref> The crucifixion scene, a central part of Christian iconography, is viewed from a historical context within the narrative style of the film. It depicts historically accurate enactment of a routinely done mass crucifixion.<ref>cf. Hewison</ref>\n\n==== Belief and dogmatism ====\n\nThe intended subject of the satire was not Jesus and his teachings but religious [[dogmatism]], according to film theorists and statements from Monty Python.<ref name=SinMPP>Shilbrack in ''Monty Python and Philosophy''. pp. 14\u201321.</ref><ref>cf. Tatum, pp.151\u2013162</ref> This is made clear in the beginning of the film during the Sermon on the Mount. Not only do the poor acoustics make it more difficult to hear what Jesus says, but the audience fails to interpret what was said correctly and sensibly. When Jesus said, \"blessed are the peacemakers\", the audience understands the phonetically similar word \"Cheesemakers\" and in turn interpret it as a metaphor and [[beatification]] of those who produce dairy products.<ref>Chapter 3 on ''Immaculate Edition DVD''</ref>\n\n''Life of Brian'' satirises, in the words of [[David Hume]], the \"strong propensity of mankind to [believe in] the extraordinary and the marvellous\".<ref>{{cite book |last1=Hume |first1=David |title=An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding : Englisch/Deutsch (Reclams Universal-Bibliothek) |publisher=Reclam Verlag |isbn=9783159611884}}</ref> When Brian cuts his sermon short and turns away from the crowd, they mistake his behaviour as not wanting to share the secret to eternal life and follow him everywhere.<ref name=\"SinMPP\"/> In their need to submit to an authority, the crowd declares him first a prophet and eventually a messiah. The faithful gather beneath Brian's window en masse to receive God's blessing. This is when Brian utters the main message of the film \"you don't need to follow anybody! You've got to think for yourselves!\" Monty Python saw this central message of the satire confirmed with the protests of practising Christians after the film was released.<ref name=\"Morgan\">{{cite book |last1=Morgan |first1=David |title=Monty Python speaks! |year=1999 |isbn=0380804794 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/montypythonspeak00morg/page/247 247-249] |url=https://archive.org/details/montypythonspeak00morg/page/247 }}</ref><ref name=\"Johnson\">{{cite book |last1=Johnson |first1=Kim \"Howard\" |title=The first 200 years of Monty Python |date=1990 |publisher=Plexus Publishing Limited |location=London |isbn=0-85965-107-X |pages=205\u2013213}}</ref>\n\n{{quote box|width=30%|bgcolor=#c6dbf7|align=right|quote=Stan: I want to be a woman.

He goes on to mention that \"Christ [is] saying all of these wonderful things about people living together in peace and love, and then for the next two thousand years people are putting each other to death in His name because they can't agree on how He said it, or in what order He said it.\"<ref name=\"Morgan\" />  The dispute among the followers about the correct interpretation of a sandal, which Brian lost, is in the words of Terry Jones the \"history of the Church in three minutes.\"<ref name=\"Morgan\" /> Kevin Shilbrack shares the view that you can enjoy the movie and still be religious.<ref name=\"SinMPP\" />\n}\nFor the most part, lost in the religious controversy was the film's mockery of factional dogmatism among [[Left-wing politics|left-wing]] parties. According to John Cleese, an almost unmanageable number of left-wing organisations and parties was formed back then in the United Kingdom. He said that it had been so important to each of them to have one pure doctrine that they would rather fight each other than their political opponent.<ref>John Cleese, Chapter 7 on ''Immaculate Edition DVD''</ref> In the film, rather than presenting a [[common front]] as their organisational names should imply, the leader of the People's Front of Judea makes it clear that their hate for the Judean Peoples's Front is greater than their hate for the Romans. They are so caught up in constant debates that the \"rather looney bunch of revolutionaries\"<ref>cf. Tatum, p.154</ref> indirectly accept the occupying forces as well as their execution methods as a fate they all have to endure. So, in the end, even though they have ample opportunity to rescue Brian, they instead leave Brian on the cross, thanking him for his sacrifice.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Schwebel |first1=Florian |title=Den Blumen eine Chance |journal=Schnitt-Das Filmmagazin |date=March 2007 |issue=47 |pages=27\u201328}}</ref>\n \nHardly mentioned in the discussion was the sideswipe at the [[women's movement]], which started to draw a lot of attention in the 1970s. In accordance with the language of political activists, resistance fighter Stan wants to exercise \"his right as a man\" to be a woman. The group accepts him from that moment on as Loretta, because the right to give birth was not theirs to take. Also as a result from that, the term sibling replaces the terms brother or sister.<ref>cf. Tatum, pp.151-162</ref>\n\n==== Individuality and meaninglessness ====\n\n{{quote box|width=40%|bgcolor=#c6dbf7|align=right|quote=Brian: \"Look, you\u2019ve got it all wrong. You don't need to follow me. You don't need to follow anybody. You've got to think for yourselves. You're all individuals.\"<br />Crowd in unison: \"YES. WE'RE ALL INDIVIDUALS.\"}}\nOne of the most commented-upon scenes in the film is when Brian tells his followers that they are all individuals and don\u2019t need to follow anybody.<ref>{{cite news |title=49 of Monty Python's most absurdly funny jokes and quotes |url=https://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/read-this/49-of-monty-pythons-most-absurdly-funny-jokes-and-quotes/ |access-date=9 February 2020 |work=Yorkshire Post}}</ref> According to Edward Slowik, this is a rare moment in which Monty Python puts a philosophical concept into words so openly and directly.<ref>Slowik in ''Monty Python and Philosophy'', p. 178</ref> ''Life of Brian'' accurately depicts the [[Existentialism|existentialist]] view that everybody needs to give meaning to their own life.<ref>Slowik in ''Monty Python and Philosophy'', p. 179</ref>\n\nBrian can thus be called an existentialist following the tradition of [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] and [[Jean-Paul Sartre]]. He is honest to himself and others and lives as authentic a life as he can. However, Brian is too na\u00efve to be called a hero based on the ideas of [[Albert Camus]]. For Camus, the search for the meaning of one's own life takes place in a deeply meaningless and abstruse world. The \"[[Absurdism|absurd]] hero\" rebels against this meaninglessness and at the same time holds on to their goals, although they know their fight leaves no impact in the long run. Contrary to that, Brian isn\u2019t able to recognize the meaninglessness of his own situation and therefore can\u2019t triumph over it.<ref name=\"Philosophy pp.14\">Shilbrack in ''Monty Python and Philosophy'', pp.14\u201321</ref>\n\nIn ''Monty Python and Philosophy'', Kevin Shilbrack states that the fundamental view of the film is that the world is absurd, and every life needs to be lived without a greater meaning. He points out that the second-last verse of the song the film finishes on, \"[[Always Look on the Bright Side of Life]]\", expresses this message clearly:\n\n{{poemquote|For life is quite absurd\nAnd death\u2019s the final word\nYou must always face the curtain with a bow.\nForget about your sin \u2013 give the audience a grin\nEnjoy it, it's your last chance anyhow.}}\n\nShilbrack concludes that the finale shows that the executions had no purpose since the deaths were meaningless and no better world was waiting for them.<ref>Shilbrack in ''Monty Python and Philosophy'', p.20</ref> On this note, some people  would claim that the film presents a [[nihilistic]] world view which contradicts any basis of religion.<ref name=\"Philosophy pp.14\"/> However, ''Life of Brian'' offers humour to counterbalance the nihilism, Shilbrack states in his text. He comments that \"religion and humour are compatible with each other and you should laugh about the absurdity since you can't fight it.\"<ref>Shilbrack in ''Monty Python and Philosophy'', p.23</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\n===Literature===\nSpin-offs include a script-book ''[[Monty Python's The Life of Brian / Monty Python Scrapbook|The Life of Brian of Nazareth]]'', which was printed back-to-back with ''[[Monty Python's The Life of Brian / Monty Python Scrapbook|MONTYPYTHONSCRAPBOOK]]'' as a single book. The printing of this book also caused problems, due to rarely used laws in the United Kingdom against blasphemy, dictating what can and cannot be written about religion. The publisher refused to print both halves of the book, and original prints were by two companies.<ref>See Hewison.</ref>\n\nJulian Doyle, the film's editor, wrote ''The Life of Brian/Jesus'', a book which not only describes the filmmaking and editing process but argues that it is the most accurate Biblical film ever made. In October 2008, a memoir by [[Kim \"Howard\" Johnson]] titled ''Monty Python's Tunisian Holiday: My Life with Brian'' was released. Johnson became friendly with the Pythons during the filming of ''Life of Brian'' and his notes and memories of the behind-the-scenes filming and make-up.<ref>[http://www.thomasdunnebooks.com/TD_TitleDetail.aspx?ISBN=0312533799 ''Monty Python's Tunisian Holiday'' by Kim \"Howard\" Johnson at ThomasDunneBooks.com].

The [[oratorio]], called ''[[Not the Messiah (He's a Very Naughty Boy)]]'', was commissioned to be part of the festival called [[Luminato]] in Toronto in June 2007, and was written/scored by Idle and [[John Du Prez]], who also worked with Idle on ''Spamalot''.
