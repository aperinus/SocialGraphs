The [[List of Walt Disney Animation Studios films|29th Disney animated feature film]] and the second movie to be produced during the [[Disney Renaissance]], it is the sequel to the 1977 film ''[[The Rescuers]]'', which was based on the novels by [[Margery Sharp]]. In ''The Rescuers Down Under'', Bernard and Bianca travel to the Australian [[Outback]] to save a boy named Cody from a villainous poacher who wants to capture an endangered [[bird of prey]] for money. Directed by Hendel Butoy and [[Mike Gabriel]] (in their feature directorial debuts) from a screenplay by Jim Cox, [[Karey Kirkpatrick]], Byron Simpson, and [[Joe Ranft]], the film features the voices of [[Bob Newhart]], [[Eva Gabor]] (in her final film role), [[John Candy]], and [[George C. Scott]].\n\nBy the mid-1980s, ''The Rescuers'' had become one of Disney's most successful animated releases. Under the new management of [[Michael Eisner]] and [[Jeffrey Katzenberg]], a feature-length sequel was approved, making it the first animated film sequel theatrically released by the studio.<ref>{{cite news |last=Solomon |first=Charles |title=Fantasy, Animation Soar in 'Rescuers Down Under' |url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1990-11-16-ca-4520-story.html |access-date=March 28, 2015 |work=Los Angeles Times |date=November 16, 1990}}</ref> Following their duties on ''[[Oliver & Company]]'' (1988), animators Butoy and Gabriel were recruited to direct the sequel.<ref name=\"Collider\">{{cite news |last=Taylor |first=Drew |url=https://collider.com/disney-rescuers-down-under-history-explained/ |title='The Rescuers Down Under': The Untold Story of How the Sequel Changed Disney Forever |website=[[Collider (website)|Collider]] |date=December 18, 2020 |access-date=December 28, 2020}}</ref> Research trips to Australia provided inspiration for the background designs.

However, it struggled at the box office, as it opened on the same day as ''[[Home Alone]]'' (which also features [[John Candy]]). The film went on to garner $47.4 million worldwide.\n\n== Plot ==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 and 700 words. Current length is 626 words. -->\nIn the Australian [[Outback]], a young boy named Cody rescues and befriends a rare [[golden eagle]] called Marahute, who shows him her nest and eggs and gives him one of her feathers. Later on, he falls into an animal trap set by Percival C. McLeach, a local [[poacher]] wanted by the [[Council ranger|Australian Rangers]]. McLeach has killed Marahute's mate; realizing Cody has Marahute's feather and must know her location, McLeach kidnaps the boy and throws his backpack to a float of [[crocodiles]]. The Rangers find it, and believe that Cody has been eaten.\n\nThe mouse who was the bait in the trap hurries to an outpost, from which a telegram is sent to the Rescue Aid Society headquarters in the [[United Nations]], [[New York City]]. Bernard and Miss Bianca, the RAS' elite field agents, are assigned to the mission, interrupting Bernard's attempts to propose marriage to Bianca. They go to find Orville the [[albatross]], who aided them before, and meet his brother Wilbur, who flies them to Australia. There, they meet Jake, a [[hopping mouse]] who is the RAS' local regional operative. Jake becomes infatuated with Bianca and flirts with her, much to Bernard's dismay. He serves as their \"tour guide\" and protector in search of the boy. Wilbur accidentally bends his [[Vertebra|spinal column]] out of shape trying to help them, so Jake sends him to the hospital (an old ambulance). Wilbur refuses to undergo surgery, but his back is straightened as he fights to escape the medical mice. He flies off in search of his friends.\n\nAt McLeach's hideout, Cody is imprisoned with a number of captured animals after refusing to divulge Marahute's whereabouts. Cody attempts to free himself and the animals, but is thwarted by Joanna, McLeach's pet [[goanna]]. Realizing that protecting Marahute's eggs is Cody's weak spot, McLeach tricks Cody into thinking someone else killed Marahute and releases him, knowing that Cody will go to her nest. Bernard, Bianca, and Jake arrive as McLeach departs in his [[Half-track|halftrack]] after Cody. The three hitch a ride on the vehicle and warn Cody upon arriving at the nest, but McLeach captures Cody, Marahute, Jake and Bianca. McLeach then sends Joanna to eat Marahute's eggs, but Bernard manages to trick her using egg-shaped stones. Wilbur arrives at the nest, and Bernard leaves Wilbur to sit on the real eggs while Bernard goes after McLeach.\n\nMcLeach takes his captives to Crocodile Falls, a huge [[waterfall]] at the end of the river he threw Cody's backpack into. He ties Cody up and hangs him over the float of crocodiles, intent on feeding Cody to them to eliminate him as a witness. Bernard, riding a wild [[razorback]] pig he tamed using a [[Horse whisperer|horse whispering]] technique he learned from Jake, arrives and disables McLeach's vehicle before he can succeed. McLeach then attempts to shoot the rope holding Cody above the water, but Bernard tricks Joanna into crashing into McLeach, sending both of them into the water. The crocodiles turn their attention to McLeach and Joanna; behind them, Cody falls into the water as the damaged rope breaks. As Joanna flees to the bank, McLeach fends off and taunts the crocodiles, forgetting about the waterfall until it is too late. He tries to swim to shore, but is washed over the edge to his death. Bernard dives into the water and holds Cody long enough for Jake and Bianca to free Marahute, allowing the eagle to save Cody and Bernard just as they go over the waterfall. \n\nBernard, desperate to prevent any further interruptions, proposes to Bianca; she immediately accepts, while Jake salutes him with new-found respect. Safe at last, the group departs for Cody's home. Meanwhile, Wilbur is still sitting on Marahute's eggs; they hatch, and one of the eaglets bites him, to his dismay.\n\n== Cast ==\n''The Rescuers Down Under'' features three characters from the first film; Bernard, Bianca and the Chairmouse, all of whom feature the same actors reprising their roles from [[The Rescuers|the original 1977 film]].\n\n* [[Bob Newhart]] as Bernard, a male grey mouse; the United States representative of the Rescue Aid Society, promoted from his role as janitor to full-fledged agent after proving a success with the previous rescue.\n* [[Eva Gabor]] as Miss Bianca, a female white mouse; the Hungarian representative of the Rescue Aid Society. This was Eva Gabor's last film role before her death in 1995.\n* [[John Candy]] as Wilbur, a comical [[albatross]]; named after [[Wilbur Wright]]. He is the brother of Orville, the albatross who appeared in the first film (named after [[Orville Wright]]).\n* Adam Ryen as Cody, a young boy able to converse with most animals, the same as Penny in the first film.\n* [[George C. Scott]] as Percival C. McLeach, a sadistic [[poaching|poacher]] who wants to capture Marahute for money.\n* [[Frank Welker]] as Marahute, a giant eagle. Welker also voiced Joanna, McLeach's pet [[goanna]], who enjoys intimidating her captives and has a fondness for eggs; and additional special vocal effects.\n* [[Tristan Rogers]] as Jake, a debonair, self-confident and charismatic [[hopping mouse]].\n* [[Peter Firth]] as Red, a male [[red kangaroo]] imprisoned by McLeach.\n* [[Wayne Robson]] as Frank, a fearful and erratic [[frill-necked lizard]] imprisoned by McLeach.\n* [[Douglas Seale]] as Krebbs, a pessimistic [[koala]] imprisoned by McLeach.\n* Carla Meyer as Faloo, a female red kangaroo who summons Cody to save Marahute. Meyer also voices Cody's mother.\n* [[Bernard Fox (actor)|Bernard Fox]] as Chairmouse, the chairman of the Rescue Aid Society. Fox also voices Doctor Mouse, the supervisor of the surgical mice who examine Wilbur when he is injured.\n* [[Russi Taylor]] as Nurse Mouse, the operator of Doctor Mouse's instructions and a competent second-in-command.\n* [[Billy Barty]] as Baitmouse.\n* [[Ed Gilbert]] as Francois, a [[cricket]] waiter who speaks with a French accent.\n* [[Peter Greenwood]] as The Airplane Captain and The Radio Announcer.\n\n== Production ==\n=== Development ===\nBy 1984, ''[[The Rescuers]]'' had become one of Disney's most successful recent animated films, earning $41 million in worldwide box office rentals.<ref>{{cite news|last=Thomas|first=Bob|author-link=Bob Thomas (reporter)|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1928&dat=19840919&id=PHsgAAAAIBAJ&pg=3804,3420618&hl=en|title=Walt Disney Productions returns to animation|newspaper=[[Sun Journal (Lewiston, Maine)|Lewison Daily Sun]]|page=28|date=September 19, 1984|access-date=February 4, 2021|via=[[Google News Archive]]}}</ref> Under the new studio management of then-CEO [[Michael Eisner]] and studio chairman [[Jeffrey Katzenberg]], it was decided that a feature-length sequel should be produced.<ref name=\"Collider\" /> Shortly after, the success of ''[[Crocodile Dundee]]'' (1986) had enhanced the appeal of Australian culture to a mainstream American audience.<ref name=\"Collider\" /> The new sequel would be set in Australia, for which writing began in 1986.<ref>{{cite book |last=Thomas |first=Bob |title=Disney's Art of Animation: From Mickey Mouse To Hercules |publisher=Disney Editions |page=121 |year=1997 |isbn=978-0-786-86241-2}}</ref>\n\nWhen ''[[Oliver & Company]]'' (1988) was nearly complete, [[Peter Schneider (film executive)|Peter Schneider]], then-president of Walt Disney Feature Animation, asked supervising animator [[Mike Gabriel]] if he would consider directing.

To animate the eagle, Keane and his animation crew enlarged the bird, shrank its head, elongated its neck and wings, and puffed out its chest. Additionally, Keane had to slow the bird's wing movements to about 25\u201330 percent of an eagle's flight speed. Because of the excessive details on Marahute, who carried 200 feathers, the character appeared for only seven minutes altogether, during the opening and ending sequences.<ref>{{cite news|title=Building Character From the Ground Up |last=Foster |first=R.

By 1990, the mania had long since subsided, and this film's Australian setting did nothing to enhance its box office appeal. Further, the film doesn't make particularly imaginative use of the location. Take away the accents and the obligatory kangaroos and koalas, and the story could have taken place anywhere. Another problem is that 'the rescuers' themselves don't even enter the action until a third of the film has passed. And when they do appear, they don't have much to do with the main plot until near the film's end. The characters seem grafted on to a story that probably would have been more successful without them. Finally, the film suffers from some action and plotting that is questionable in a children's film. The villain is far too malignant, the young vigilante hero seems to be a kiddie '[[John Rambo|Rambo]],' and some of the action is quite violent, if not tasteless.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.tvguide.com/movies/rescuers/review/128212/ |title=The Rescuers Down Under Review |work=TV Guide |date=November 3, 2009 |access-date=August 24, 2011}}</ref>\n\n[[Josh Spiegel]] echoes that point and expands on it, explaining, \"''The Rescuers Down Under'' tanked with barely $3.5 million in its opening-weekend take, Katzenberg removed all television advertisements for the film. By itself, that's not the worst possible fate, but it proves that he had zero confidence in its ability to perform at a seemingly ideal time of year. Here's the thing: the more demoralizing fact isn't that Katzenberg yanked the marketing. It's that Disney set ''The Rescuers Down Under'' up to fail, opening it on the same weekend as a little film called ''[[Home Alone]]'', otherwise known as the highest-grossing film of 1990. He may not have been able to predict its long-lasting impact on popular culture, but Katzenberg likely had enough tracking information to tip him off that ''Home Alone'' would be a monster laying waste to everything in its path. ''The Rescuers Down Under'' was forced to take the hit, then and afterwards.\"<ref>{{cite web |last=Spiegel |first=Josh |url=https://www.popoptiq.com/extended-thoughts-on-the-rescuers-down-under/ |title=Extended thoughts on 'The Rescuers Down Under' \u2013 Movie Review |website=PopOptiq |access-date=July 16, 2013|date=January 26, 2013}}</ref> Conversely, Ellen MacKay of [[Common Sense Media]] gave the film four out of five stars, writing, \"A rare sequel that improves on the original\".<ref>{{cite web |last=MacKay |first=Ellen |url=https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/the-rescuers-down-under |title=The Rescuers Down Under \u2013 Movie Review |website=Common Sense Media |access-date=May 27, 2012 |date=September 14, 2009}}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Wikiquote}}\n* {{Official website|https://movies.disney.com/the-rescuers-down-under}}\n* {{AllMovie title|40981}}\n* {{BCDB title|10}}\n* {{IMDb title|0100477}}\n* {{TCMDb title|24413|The Rescuers Down Under}}\n\n{{Navboxes\n|title = ''The Rescuers Down Under''\n|list =\n{{Disney theatrical animated features}}\n{{Walt Disney Animation Studios}}\n{{Disney Renaissance}}\n{{Mike Gabriel}}\n{{Karey Kirkpatrick}}\n}}\n{{Navboxes\n|title = Awards for ''The Rescuers Down Under''\n|list =\n{{Dallas\u2013Fort Worth Film Critics Association Award for Best Animated Film}}\n{{Los Angeles Film Critics Association Award for Best Animated Film}}\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Rescuers Down Under, The}}\n[[Category:1990 animated films]]\n[[Category:1990 directorial debut films]]\n[[Category:1990 films]]\n[[Category:1990s adventure films]]\n[[Category:1990s American animated films]]\n[[Category:1990s children's animated films]]\n[[Category:1990 comedy-drama films]]\n[[Category:1990s crime drama films]]\n[[Category:1990s crime comedy films]]\n[[Category:1990s fantasy-comedy films]]\n[[Category:1990s English-language films]]\n[[Category:American adventure drama films]]\n[[Category:American buddy films]]\n[[Category:American children's animated adventure films]]\n[[Category:American children's animated comedy films]]\n[[Category:American children's animated drama films]]\n[[Category:American children's animated fantasy films]]\n[[Category:American coming-of-age films]]\n[[Category:American crime drama films]]\n[[Category:American crime comedy films]]\n[[Category:American fantasy adventure films]]\n[[Category:American sequel films]]\n[[Category:Animated buddy films]]\n[[Category:Animated coming-of-age films]]\n[[Category:Animated films about birds]]\n[[Category:Animated films about reptiles and amphibians]]\n[[Category:Animated films based on children's books]]\n[[Category:Animated films set in New York City]]\n[[Category:Disney Renaissance]]\n[[Category:Films about child abduction]]\n[[Category:Films about animals]]\n[[Category:Films based on British novels]]\n[[Category:Films based on works by Margery Sharp]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Hendel Butoy]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Mike Gabriel]]\n[[Category:Animated films about mice]]\n[[Category:Films about animal rights]]\n[[Category:Films about hunters]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Bruce Broughton]]\n[[Category:Films set in New York City]]\n[[Category:Films set in the Outback]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by Joe Ranft]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by Karey Kirkpatrick]]\n[[Category:Walt Disney Animation Studios films]]\n[[Category:Walt Disney Pictures films]]"}]}}}}
