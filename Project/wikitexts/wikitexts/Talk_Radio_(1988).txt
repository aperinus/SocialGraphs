The film was based on the [[Talk Radio (play)|play of the same name]] by Bogosian and Tad Savinar. Portions of the film and play were based on the [[assassination]] of Denver radio host [[Alan Berg]] in 1984<ref>[https://www.nathanrabin.com/happy-place/2021/6/29/control-nathan-rabin-40-210-talk-radio-1988 Control Nathan Rabin 4.0 #210 Talk Radio (1988) - Nathan Rabin's Happy Place]</ref> and the book ''Talked to Death: The Life and Murder of Alan Berg'' by Stephen Singular.<ref>[https://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/talk-radio/Film?oid=1063608 Chicago Reader]</ref> The film was entered into the [[39th Berlin International Film Festival]], where it won the [[Silver Bear]].<ref name=\"Berlinale\">{{cite web |url=http://www.berlinale.de/en/archiv/jahresarchive/1989/03_preistr_ger_1989/03_Preistraeger_1989.html |title=Berlinale: 1989 Prize Winners |access-date=2011-03-13 |work=berlinale.de}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nBarry Champlain, a [[Jewish]] radio personality in [[Dallas, Texas]], is a host with a biting sense of humor and a knack for condescending to his audience with his controversial political views.\n\nChamplain's radio show is about to go nationwide.  A former suit salesman (real name:  Barry Golden), he achieves his rise to fame through guest shots on the Jeff Fisher radio show (using different pseudonyms, eventually landing on Champlain). Barry begins to steal the show with his acerbic sense of humor and sharp wit, which aggravates Fisher. Barry is subsequently given his own show, which rises to the top of the [[Arbitron]] radio ratings. Barry receives calls from people who appreciate him for what he does and how he does it, as well as people who seem to hate him. Attacking everyone from gays to drug addicts to rednecks to African Americans, he has a substantial number of hostile callers, from people who take offense to his attitude to radical right-wingers to hate groups phoning in to harass and intimidate him. He receives threatening [[fan mail]] when one caller makes a [[bomb threat]]. His rise to fame is accompanied not only by attention from [[Political radicalism|radical]] [[far-right]] elements, but also with the alienation of his wife.\n\nAs his show is going through a final audition to go into [[Radio syndication|national syndication]], Barry grows increasingly [[Social isolation|isolated]] and asks his ex-wife Ellen to come and visit him, saying he needs her input and that she's the only person he trusts. They attempt a return to their relationship. Using a fake name and calling from the radio studio, Ellen talks to Barry on the air\u2014the only place he seems to relate to people openly\u2014in an attempt to reach him, to bring him back from the [[Depression (mood)|depression]] he seems to be suffering from. She begs for him to come back, but Barry refuses, bitterly attacking her as the [[Radio producer|radio production staff]], all friends of Ellen, watch in horror; Ellen walks away. Barry confesses his true intentions, admitting he cares more for personal gain than the societal ills he addresses and refusing to apologize for his [[hypocrisy]]. He shouts that the American people scare him because of what has happened to his friends, family, and co-workers. He berates his callers that they have nothing worth saying and that they tolerate his [[abuse]] and return for more. He screams at them to go away, seemingly unaware of the apparent fact that he attracts his listeners and most of the ire he receives. Ultimately, he realizes he has made his bed and is as stuck with them as they are with him. Despite Barry's meltdown, his co-workers tell him it's now the highest-rated segment in the show's history, and his boss adds that the show will go national.\n\nWhile Barry is walking to his car, an apparent fan asks for his autograph. As Barry signs it, the \"fan\" pulls out a gun and shoots him several times, killing him. As the film ends, callers to Barry's show, his co-workers, and Ellen speak on air about him. They say that Barry was a talented, intelligent and funny man, but none of that mattered; he hated himself, and his death wish was finally granted.\n\n==Cast==\n<!--- Cast and order per closing tombstone credits, roles per closing credits scroll --->\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Eric Bogosian]] - Barry\n* [[Alec Baldwin]] - Dan\n* [[Ellen Greene]] - Ellen\n* [[Leslie Hope]] - Laura\n* [[John C.

Wincott, Levine, Trebor, and Corduner, each credited above for on-screen characters, also provided voices for callers.\n\n==Production==\nEric Bogosian wrote the screenplay with help from director Oliver Stone. The script was almost entirely based on Bogosian's [[Pulitzer Prize]]-nominated<ref>[https://www.pulitzer.org/finalists/eric-bogosian The Pulitzer Prizes]</ref> original play with some biographical information about [[Alan Berg]], a talk show host in Denver who was murdered in 1984 by white supremacists. In his research for the film version, Bogosian often watched the on-air production of [[Tom Leykis]]' talk show, then originating from Los Angeles station [[KFI]]. Bogosian's fictional character shares many speech patterns and mannerisms with Leykis.\n\nFilming took place mainly in [[Dallas, Texas]] and [[Irving, Texas]]. Unlike the film, the original play takes place entirely during the on-air broadcast, and there are no scenes outside the radio station.\n\n==Reception==\n''Talk Radio'' received mostly positive reviews from critics<ref>{{cite web |date=1 January 1988 |author=Variety Staff |title=Talk Radio |url=https://variety.com/1987/film/reviews/talk-radio-1200427448/ |website=Variety }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |date=1 January 2000 |title=Talk Radio |url=https://www.empireonline.com/movies/reviews/talk-radio-review |website=Empire }}</ref>\nOn [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film has a \"Certified Fresh\" approval rating of 82% based on 50 reviews, with an average rating of 7/10. The consensus summarizes: \"The gripping union of a director and star at the peak of their respective powers, ''Talk Radio'' offers the viewer a singularly unlikable character and dares you to look away.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/talk_radio/ |title=Talk Radio (1988) |website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |publisher=[[Fandango Media]] |access-date=29 October 2022 }}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of American films of 1988]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* Rossi, Umberto. \u201cAcousmatic Presences: From DJs to Talk-Radio Hosts in American Fiction, Cinema, and Drama\u201d, ''Mosaic'', 42:1, March 2009, pp.&nbsp;83\u201398.\n\n==External links==\n{{Wikiquote}}\n* {{IMDb title|id=0096219|title=Talk Radio}}\n* {{TCMDb title|20303|title=Talk Radio}}\n* {{Letterboxd film|talk-radio}}\n* {{Amg movie|48550|Talk Radio}}\n* {{rotten-tomatoes|talk_radio|Talk Radio}}\n* {{Mojo title|talkradio|Talk Radio}}\n\n{{Oliver Stone}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Talk Radio}}\n[[Category:1988 films]]\n[[Category:1988 drama films]]\n[[Category:1988 independent films]]\n[[Category:1988 thriller films]]\n[[Category:American drama films]]\n[[Category:American thriller films]]\n[[Category:American independent films]]\n[[Category:Biographical films about radio people]]\n[[Category:Films \u00e0 clef]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Stewart Copeland]]\n[[Category:American films based on plays]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Oliver Stone]]\n[[Category:Films set in Dallas]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Dallas]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by Oliver Stone]]\n[[Category:Universal Pictures films]]\n[[Category:Alliance Atlantis films]]\n[[Category:Films about radio people]]\n[[Category:1980s English-language films]]\n[[Category:1980s American films]]"}]}}}}
