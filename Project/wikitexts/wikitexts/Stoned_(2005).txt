The film was directed by [[Stephen Woolley]], and written by [[Neal Purvis and Robert Wade]]. [[Leo Gregory]] played the role of Brian Jones and [[Paddy Considine]] of Frank Thorogood.\n\n==Plot==\nThe film is a cinematic work of [[historical fiction]], taking as its premise the idea that Jones was murdered by Frank Thorogood, a builder who had been hired to renovate and improve Jones's house [[Cotchford Farm]] in [[East Sussex]], though there is a curious ghost-epilogue where Jones comes back to earth to thank chauffeur/minder Tom Keylock \u2013 not Thorogood \u2013 for making him into an immortal martyr. The film also paints a picture of Jones's use of alcohol and drugs, his estrangement from his bandmates, and his relationships with [[Anita Pallenberg]] and [[Anna Wohlin]].\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Leo Gregory]] as [[Brian Jones]]\n* [[Paddy Considine]] as Frank Thorogood\n* [[David Morrissey]] as Tom Keylock\n* [[Ben Whishaw]] as [[Keith Richards]]\n* [[Luke de Woolfson]] as [[Mick Jagger]]\n* [[Tuva Novotny]] as Anna Wohlin\n* [[Amelia Warner]] as Janet\n* [[Monet Mazur]] as [[Anita Pallenberg]]\n* [[Ras Barker]] as The Lodger\n* [[Gary Love]] as Jeff\n* [[Will Adamsdale]] as [[Andrew Loog Oldham]]\n* [[Josef Altin]] as [[Bill Wyman]]\n\n==Reception==\nThe film was poorly received by critics. On [[Rotten Tomatoes]], it holds a rating of 16% from 51 reviews with the consensus: \"Poorly cast and sloppily assembled, ''Stoned'' turns one of rock 'n' roll's most darkly fascinating mysteries into a cinematic tragedy all its own.\"<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/stoned | title=Stoned | website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] }}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://film.britishcouncil.org/stoned   ''Stoned''] at [[British Council|British Council\u2013Film]]\n*[http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b8afdf0d0  '' Stoned''] at [[British Film Institute|BFI]]\n*[http://lumiere.obs.coe.int/web/film_info/?id=24504  '' Stoned''] at [[Lumiere (database)|Lumiere]]\n*{{IMDb title|id= 0426627|title=Stoned}}\n*{{rotten-tomatoes|stoned}}\n\n[[Category:2005 films]]\n[[Category:2005 directorial debut films]]\n[[Category:2000s biographical films]]\n[[Category:Biographical films about musicians]]\n[[Category:British biographical films]]\n[[Category:British rock music films]]\n[[Category:Cultural depictions of the Rolling Stones]]\n[[Category:Films based on multiple works]]\n[[Category:Films scored by David Arnold]]\n[[Category:Films set in East Sussex]]\n[[Category:Films set in the 1960s]]\n[[Category:Films shot at Pinewood Studios]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by Neal Purvis and Robert Wade]]\n[[Category:Number 9 Films films]]\n[[Category:The Rolling Stones films]]\n[[Category:Vertigo Films films]]\n[[Category:2000s English-language films]]\n[[Category:2000s British films]]\n\n\n{{bio-film-stub}}"}]}}}}
