Agatha has severe burns to her face and body, requiring her to take a copious amount of medication. Benjie visits a child suffering from [[non-Hodgkin lymphoma]] in the hospital; the girl later dies, and Benjie is confronted by her ghost. Benjie's father, Dr. Stafford Weiss, is a TV psychologist who is treating aging actress Havana Segrand for abuse she suffered at the hands of her deceased mother, also an actress. Havana's agent struggles to get Havana a role in a remake of her mother's film ''Stolen Waters.'' Havana routinely hallucinates about the deceased younger version of her mother.\n\nBenjie and his mother, Cristina, negotiate a role for Benjie in a film as his comeback after drug rehabilitation. At the suggestion of [[Carrie Fisher]], Havana hires Agatha, whom Carrie had met on [[Twitter]], as a personal assistant. Agatha continues to see Jerome, and a romance forms, though Jerome appears resistant at first. Stafford learns through Havana that Agatha has returned to L.A. Agatha is Benjie's sister \u2013 however, she is shunned by her parents (Cristina and Stafford).\n\nUsing Havana's role in ''Stolen Waters'' to gain access to the production lot, Agatha visits Benjie on set. A schizophrenic, Agatha tells him that she has returned from a sanatorium to make amends for setting the fire that burned her and nearly killed him when he was seven. When Stafford learns Agatha visited Benjie, he finds her in her hotel room, gives her $10,000, and tells her to leave L.A. before she ruins everything.\n\nBenjie breaks his sobriety, getting high on [[Gamma-Hydroxybutyric acid|GHB]], and carelessly shoots the dog of his only friend. Agatha visits her mother, Cristina, and reveals that before she set the fire she had discovered that her parents were brother and sister, making Agatha and Benjie children of incest. Cristina tells her they were separated as children and didn't know they were related. Stafford comes home, and when Agatha tells him she knows about their familial relations, Stafford violently beats her, until Cristina intervenes. During the altercation, Agatha steals Cristina's wedding ring. On set, Benjie is haunted by the girl from the hospital and, during an hallucination, he strangles his young co-star. The child survives, though Benjie is now to be replaced in the film.\n\nHavana requests Jerome as a driver and seduces him in the backseat of his parked limo in the driveway of her home as Agatha watches from the window. Havana enters the house and berates Agatha for her poor performance at work and then verbally humiliates her when she finds that the girl has stained her expensive couch with menstrual blood. Agatha beats Havana to death with one of her awards.\n\nBenjie escapes the hospital and comes to Havana's house to find Agatha. Agatha tells him it all must end now. She shows him that she has their mother's wedding ring and instructs him to go get their father's ring.\n\nStafford returns home to see Cristina on fire outside beside the pool. As she screams, engulfed in flames, he uses a piece of pool furniture to push her into the pool where she dies. Benjie arrives and finds his father by the pool in a catatonic state. He takes his father's wedding ring off his finger, then reunites with Agatha at the site of their previous home that Agatha had burned down. On the fireplace hearth, the siblings perform an impromptu wedding ceremony with their parents' wedding rings.\n\nThey take an extreme amount of Agatha's pills together so that they may die by suicide, before lying down to watch the stars.\n\n=== Underlying theme ===\n\nThroughout the film, liberal quotings from [[Paul \u00c9luard]]'s poem \"[[Liberty (poem)|Libert\u00e9]]\" meander \"through each of the characters' lives,\" creating an underlying mantra for the film.<ref name=Collin >{{cite news |last=Collin |first=Robbie | author-link=Robbie Collin|date=September 26, 2014 |title=Maps to the Stars, review: 'tremendous' |work=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]] |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/filmreviews/11121111/Maps-to-the-Stars-review-tremendous.html |access-date=October 1, 2014 }}</ref>\n\n== Cast ==\n{{multiple image\n| direction = vertical\n| width     = 130\n| footer    = From top to bottom: Moore, Wasikowska, Cusack, Bird, Williams, Pattinson, and Gadon\n| image1    = Julianne Moore (15011443428).jpg\n| alt1      = Julianne Moore\n| image2    = Mia Wasikowska Cannes 2014.jpg\n| alt2      = Mia Wasikowska\n| image3    = John Cusack Cannes 2014.jpg\n| alt3      = John Cusack\n| image4    = Evan Bird Cannes 2014.jpg\n| alt4      = Evan Bird\n| image5    = Olivia Williams July 9, 2014 (cropped).jpg\n| alt5      = Olivia Williams\n| image6    = Robert Pattinson Cannes 2014.jpg\n| alt6      = Robert Pattinson\n| image7    = Sarah Gadon Cannes 2014.jpg\n| alt7      = Sarah Gadon\n}}\n\n;Main cast\n* [[Julianne Moore]] as Havana Segrand <br /> A famous but aging and fading actress living in the shadow of her legendary movie-star mother and feeling abused by her. Moore based the character on \"an amalgam of people I've known and observed. She is someone who lives completely isolated in this make-believe world. She doesn't really have a family and she's still very angry with her mother because she feels she was abused.

Wasikowska said, \"I love Agatha because she's dark inside but at the same time in a lot of ways she has this very positive outlook. There's something very sweet and sad about this girl who, in the midst of these celebrity-obsessed parents, and this troubled past, really just wants to connect with them. They've totally rejected her, but in a way, she's desperately trying to mimic their lives. She's desperately trying to find her identity.\" She further added, \"She has the gloves she wears over her burns, the facial scar, and all these rituals with the poem and the pills she takes, it's all very distinct to who she is.\"<ref name=\"pathefilms\" />\n* [[John Cusack]] as Stafford Weiss <br /> The head of the Weiss family, a TV psychologist with a number of high-profile celebrity clients, and immensely egoistic about the success of his son Benjie. Stafford exploits people's emotions and takes advantage of them. Stafford Weiss and his wife Cristina are brother and sister; they were separated at birth and discovered their relation after meeting in college and becoming a couple. According to Cusack, \"He sees himself as a healer. He's part [[Tony Robbins]], part [[Reiki|Reiki Master]], part shrink. But his son is the real star\u2014he's a massive teen star of [[Justin Bieber|Bieberesque]] proportions.\" Describing the script he said, \"It was the most savage destruction of Hollywood fame and secrets and that whole toxic brew that I'd ever seen.\"<ref name=\"pathefilms\" />\n* [[Evan Bird]] as Benjie Weiss <br /> A child actor sensation and controversial star who is trying to get his career on track after his stint at rehab while simultaneously battling demons from his past. Cronenberg was not sure that any child actor could play Benjie's character successfully until he saw Bird in the TV series ''[[The Killing (American TV series)|The Killing]]''. Bird said about his character, \"[H]e doesn't really have love and yet he doesn't really have limitations, either. So he's searching for both of those things. He's making way too much money, he's being taken advantage of by his parents, and he's really screwed up.\"<ref name=\"pathefilms\" />\n* [[Olivia Williams]] as Cristina Weiss <br /> Ambitious and controlling, she manages the career of her son. Cristina Weiss and her husband Stafford are sister and brother; they were separated at birth and discovered their relation after meeting in college and becoming a couple. According to Williams, \"She is a very ambitious woman and we get to see her downfall from the very heights of her power. She operates in a world where someone could be the nastiest person on earth and make your life hell, but you might still want them in your movie because they'll make you money.\"<ref name=\"pathefilms\" />\n* [[Robert Pattinson]] as Jerome Fontana <br /> A limousine driver and struggling actor who wants to be a successful screenwriter. Jerome is inspired by [[Bruce Wagner]], who, at the time when he conceived the idea for this story, was himself a struggling actor and writer working as a limo driver. Pattinson described the character as most sane and ordinary but like every LA dreamer in the story and said, \"Jerome would never accept that he is just a limo driver. I think he feels he's just waiting for his break. And yet, he's seemingly the only one in this story who's not going insane\u2014or who isn't a ghost.\" And about the script he added that \"It's really about people who lie to themselves\u2014right up until the end.\"<ref name=\"pathefilms\" />\n* [[Sarah Gadon]] as Clarice Taggart <br /> An iconic Hollywood movie star who died in a fire and appears as a twenty-something-year-old ghost to her daughter Havana.
