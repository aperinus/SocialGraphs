[[John Irvin]] directed and [[Jonathan Powell (producer)|Jonathan Powell]] produced this adaptation of [[John le Carr\u00e9]]'s novel ''[[Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy]]'' (1974). The serial, which stars [[Alec Guinness]], [[Alexander Knox]], [[Ian Richardson]], [[Michael Jayston]], [[Bernard Hepton]], [[Anthony Bate]], [[Ian Bannen]], [[George Sewell]] and [[Michael Aldridge]], was shown in the United Kingdom from 10 September to 22 October 1979, and in the United States beginning on 29 September 1980. The US version was {{Nowrap|re-edited}} from the original seven episodes to fit into six episodes.\n\nThe series was followed by ''[[Smiley's People (TV series)|Smiley's People]]'' in 1982.\n\n==Plot==\n[[George Smiley]], deputy to the head of the [[Secret Intelligence Service|British Secret Intelligence Service]], is forced into retirement in the wake of Operation Testify, a failed spy mission to Czechoslovakia. Veteran British agent [[Jim Prideaux]] has been sent to meet a Czech general, having been told the general had information identifying a deep-cover Soviet spy planted in the highest echelons of the British Secret Intelligence Service\u2014known as the Circus, because of its headquarters at [[Cambridge Circus, London|Cambridge Circus]] in London.\n\nThe mission proves to be a trap, and Prideaux is captured and brutally tortured by the Soviets. The Chief of the Circus, known only as [[Control (fictional character)|Control]], is disgraced for his role in Testify, and is replaced by his rival Percy Alleline. Control's obsession with the possibility of a Soviet mole at the Circus is not shared by others in the organization, who insist that any leaks and failures at the Circus were due to Control's incompetence. On the contrary, Alleline and the rest of the new leadership team at the Circus believe that ''they'' have a mole, code-named Merlin, working for them in Moscow Centre, the KGB headquarters, passing them secrets in an operation code-named Witchcraft. Others in the British and American intelligence communities have been impressed with the information produced by Witchcraft, and Alleline and his team are regarded as a refreshing change from Control.\n\nMore than a year after Testify and the shake-up at the Circus, [[Ricki Tarr]], a British agent gone missing in Lisbon, turns up in England with new evidence backing up Control's theory of a mole at the Circus. While on a routine mission Tarr had been approached by Irina, a low-level Soviet agent who claimed to know the identity of the mole and wanted to trade it for permission to defect. As soon as Tarr had informed the Circus of Irina's offer, she was abducted and spirited back to Russia. Tarr, convinced he had been betrayed by the mole Irina was going to identify, believed that he would also be targeted and murdered. Returning to London secretly, Tarr contacts Oliver Lacon, a senior civil servant who is the liaison between the Circus and the British Cabinet.\n\nBefore his ousting, Control had narrowed his list of suspects to five men \u2013 Roy Bland, Toby Esterhase, Bill Haydon, Percy Alleline, and George Smiley \u2013 all of whom occupied high positions in the Circus. Knowing the Soviet spy is highly placed in the Circus, Lacon cannot trust the Circus to uncover the mole or even allow its personnel to know of the investigation. Smiley, who had been fired along with Control while Control's other four suspects were promoted, is recalled by Lacon and given instructions to expose the mole. With the help of his [[prot\u00e9g\u00e9]], [[Peter Guillam]], who is still in the Circus, Smiley begins a secret investigation into the events surrounding Operation Testify, believing it will lead him to the identity of the mole, whom Moscow Centre has given the cover name ''Gerald''.\n\nSmiley learns that Operation Witchcraft uses a safe house to meet with Aleksey Aleksandrovich Polyakov, a Soviet agent. Polyakov appears to hand over valuable intelligence material, but this is actually \"chickenfeed\", and the operation is a cover by which Gerald passes valuable material to Polyakov. Smiley forces Toby Esterhase to reveal the location of the safe house. Tarr is sent to Paris, from where he sends a coded message to Alleline about \"information crucial to the well-being of the Service\". This triggers an emergency meeting between Gerald and Polyakov at the safe house, where Smiley and Guillam are lying in wait.\n\nThe mole is revealed to be Bill Haydon. Haydon is debriefed by Smiley but is killed by Jim Prideaux before he can be [[Prisoner exchange|exchanged]] with the Russians.\n\n==Cast==\n{{colbegin|colwidth=}}\n* [[Alec Guinness]] as [[George Smiley]] / \"Beggarman\"\n* [[Alexander Knox]] as [[Control (fictional character)|Control]]\n* [[Michael Jayston]] as [[Peter Guillam]]\n* [[Anthony Bate]] as Oliver Lacon\n* [[Bernard Hepton]] as [[Toby Esterhase]] / \"Poorman\"\n* [[Ian Richardson]] as [[Bill Haydon]] / \"Tailor\"\n* [[Ian Bannen]] as [[Jim Prideaux]]\n* [[Hywel Bennett]] as [[Ricki Tarr]]\n* [[Michael Aldridge]] as Percy Alleline / \"Tinker\"\n* [[Terence Rigby]] as Roy Bland / \"Soldier\"\n* [[George Sewell]] as Mendel\n* [[Beryl Reid]] as [[Connie Sachs]]\n* [[Joss Ackland]] as [[Jerry Westerby]]\n* [[Si\u00e2n Phillips]] as Ann Smiley\n* Frank Moorey as Lauder Strickland\n* [[Nigel Stock (actor)|Nigel Stock]] as Roddy Martindale\n* [[John Standing]] as Sam Collins\n* [[Thorley Walters]] as Tufty Thessinger\n* [[John Wells (satirist)|John Wells]] as Headmaster\n* [[Patrick Stewart]] as [[Karla (character)|Karla]]\n* Mandy Cuthbert as Molly Purcell\n* [[Warren Clarke]] as Alwyn\n* Joe Praml as Paul Skordeno\n* [[Susan Kodicek]] as Irina\n* [[Alec Sabin]] as Fawn\n* [[Hilary Minster]] as Boris\n* [[George Pravda]] as Polyakov\n* Duncan Jones as \"Jumbo\" Roach\n{{colend}}\n\n==Production==\nShortly before filming began, Alec Guinness asked author John le Carr\u00e9 to introduce him to a real spy to aid him in preparing for his role. Le Carr\u00e9 invited Guinness to lunch with Sir [[Maurice Oldfield]], who served as Chief of the British Intelligence Service from 1973 to 1978. During their meal, Guinness intently studied Oldfield for any mannerisms or quirks that he could use in his performance. When he saw Oldfield run his finger around the rim of his wine glass, he asked whether Oldfield was checking for poison\u2014much to Oldfield's astonishment, as he was only checking how clean the glass was.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2002/oct/11/artsfeatures |title=Over lunch, he turned himself into a spy |first=John |last=le Carr\u00e9 |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=11 October 2002 |location=London |issn=0261-3077 |oclc=60623878 |access-date=5 January 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe series was shot on location in London, including some of the intelligence agency scenes which were shot in the [[BBC]] offices; in [[Glasgow]] for scenes in [[Czechoslovakia]], at [[Oxford University]], at [[Bredon School]] in [[Gloucestershire]] where the character Jim Prideaux was a master, and elsewhere.<ref>{{cite AV media |people=Powell, Jonathan |date=25 October 2011 |title=Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy: Production Notes |medium=DVD |location=Disc 1 |publisher=[[Acorn DVD]]}}</ref>\n\n==Music==\nThe end credits music, an arrangement of \"[[Nunc dimittis]]\" (\"Lord, now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace\") from the ''[[Book of Common Prayer]] ''(1662), was composed by [[Geoffrey Burgon]] for organ, strings, trumpet, and [[Treble (voice)|treble]]; the score earned Burgon the [[Ivor Novello Award]] for 1979<ref>{{cite news |title=Geoffrey Burgon, British composer |url=http://archive.boston.com/bostonglobe/obituaries/articles/2010/09/24/geoffrey_burgon_british_composer/ |work=[[The Boston Globe]] |agency=[[Associated Press]] |access-date=12 September 2012 |date=24 September 2010}}</ref> and reached 56 on the [[UK Singles Chart]].
