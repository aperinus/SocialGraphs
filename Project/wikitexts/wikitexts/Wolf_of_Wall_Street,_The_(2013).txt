It recounts Belfort's perspective on his career as a [[stockbroker]] in New York City and how his firm, [[Stratton Oakmont]], engaged in rampant corruption and fraud on [[Wall Street]], which ultimately led to his downfall. [[Leonardo DiCaprio]], who was also a producer of the film, stars as Belfort, with [[Jonah Hill]] as his business partner and friend, [[Danny Porush|Donnie Azoff]], [[Margot Robbie]] as his wife, Naomi Lapaglia, and [[Kyle Chandler]] as [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] agent Patrick Denham, who tries to take Belfort down.\n\nRights for Belfort's memoir were secured in 2007 by DiCaprio and [[Warner Bros.]] and with Scorsese set to direct, but content restrictions stalled production. The project was later greenlit under an independent production house [[Red Granite Pictures]]. Filming took place in late 2012 in [[New York City]] and was shot mostly on [[film stock]].\n\nThe film premiered in New York City on December 17, 2013, and was released in the United States on December 25, 2013, by [[Paramount Pictures]], and was the first major American film to be released exclusively through [[digital distribution]].<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://newrepublic.com/article/119431/how-digital-cinema-took-over-35mm-film|title=The Triumph of Digital Will Be the Death of Many Movies - History|magazine=The New Republic|date=September 12, 2014|publisher=newrepublic.com|access-date=2021-06-22}}</ref> It was a major commercial success, grossing $392 million worldwide during its theatrical run, becoming Scorsese's highest-grossing film.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://boxofficemojo.com/yearly/chart/?view2=worldwide&yr=2013&p=.htm |title=2013 Yearly Box Office Results |website=[[Box Office Mojo]] |access-date=October 4, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151205230715/http://www.boxofficemojo.com/yearly/chart/?view2=worldwide&yr=2013&p=.htm|archive-date=December 5, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> The film was controversial for morally ambiguous depiction of events and lack of sympathy for victims, as well as explicit sexual content, extreme [[profanity]], depiction of hard drug use, and the [[Animals in film and television|use of animals]] during production. It set a [[Guinness World Records|Guinness World Record]] for the most instances of swearing in a film. The film's financing became implicated in the [[1Malaysia Development Berhad scandal|1Malaysia Development Berhad corruption scandal]], leading to Red Granite Pictures being investigated by the [[United States Department of Justice|U.S. Department of Justice]] and [[Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission]].\n\nThe film received positive reviews from critics (along with some moral censure) and appeared in several 'best of the year' lists. It was [[List of accolades received by The Wolf of Wall Street (2013 film)|nominated for several awards]], including five at the [[86th Academy Awards]] ceremony: [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]], [[Academy Award for Best Writing (Adapted Screenplay)|Best Adapted Screenplay]], [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] (for DiCaprio) and [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Supporting Actor]] (for Hill). DiCaprio won [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor \u2013 Motion Picture Musical or Comedy|Best Actor \u2013 Musical or Comedy]] at the [[71st Golden Globe Awards]], where the film was also nominated for [[Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture \u2013 Musical or Comedy|Best Picture \u2013 Musical or Comedy]].\n\n== Plot ==\nIn 1987, [[Jordan Belfort]] lands a job as a [[Wall Street]] [[stockbroker]] for [[L.F. Rothschild]], employed under Mark Hanna. He is quickly enticed into the drug-fueled stockbroker culture and Hanna's belief that a broker's only goal is to make money for himself. Jordan loses his job following [[Black Monday (1987)|Black Monday]], the largest one-[[Stock market crash|day stock market drop]] in history, and takes a job at a [[Boiler room (business)|boiler room brokerage firm]] on [[Long Island]] that specializes in [[penny stock]]s. Jordan makes a small fortune thanks to his aggressive pitching style and the high commissions.\n\nJordan befriends his neighbor [[Danny Porush|Donnie Azoff]], and the two found their own company. They recruit several of Jordan's friends, whom Jordan trains in the art of the \"hard sell.\" Jordan's tactics and salesmanship largely contribute to the success of his [[pump and dump]] scheme, which involves inflating the price of a stock by issuing misleading, positive statements in order to sell it at an artificially augmented price. When the scheme's perpetrators sell their overvalued securities, the price drops immensely, and those who were conned into buying at the inflated price are left with stock that is suddenly worth much less than what they paid. To cloak this, Jordan gives the firm the respectable-sounding name [[Stratton Oakmont]] in 1989.\n\nAfter an expos\u00e9 in ''[[Forbes]]'', hundreds of ambitious young financiers flock to his company. Jordan becomes immensely successful and slides into a decadent lifestyle of prostitutes and drugs. He has an affair with a woman named Naomi Lapaglia; when his wife finds out, Jordan divorces her and marries Naomi in 1991. Meanwhile, the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission|SEC]] and the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] begin investigating Stratton Oakmont.\n\nIn 1993, Jordan illegally makes $22 million in three hours after securing the [[Initial public offering|IPO]] of [[Steve Madden (company)|Steve Madden]]. This brings him and his firm further to the attention of the FBI. To hide his money, Jordan opens a [[Swiss bank account]] with corrupt banker Jean-Jacques Saurel in the name of Naomi's Aunt Emma, who is a British subject and thus outside the immediate reach of American authorities. He uses the wife and in-laws of his friend Brad Bodnick, who have European passports, to smuggle the cash into [[Switzerland]].\n\nDonnie and Brad get into a public brawl during a money exchange which results in Brad being arrested, but Donnie escapes. Jordan learns from his private investigator that the FBI is wiretapping his phones. Fearing for his son, Jordan's father advises him to leave Stratton Oakmont and lie low while Jordan's lawyer negotiates a deal to keep him out of prison. Jordan, however, cannot bear to quit and talks himself into staying in the middle of his farewell speech.\n\nIn 1996, Jordan, Donnie, and their wives are on a yacht trip to [[Italy]] when they learn that Aunt Emma has died. Jordan proceeds to Switzerland to [[forgery|forge her name]] and save the account. To bypass border controls, he orders his yacht captain to sail to [[Monaco]], but the ship capsizes in a storm. After their rescue, the plane sent to take them to [[Geneva]] is destroyed when a seagull flies into the engine; Jordan takes this as a sign from God and attempts to sober his drug addiction.\n\nIn 1998, the FBI arrests Jordan because Saurel (detained for an unrelated offense) has informed the FBI about Jordan. Since the evidence against him is overwhelming, Jordan agrees to gather evidence on his colleagues in exchange for leniency. Naomi tells Jordan she is divorcing him and wants full custody of their daughter and infant son. In a cocaine-fueled rage, Jordan hits Naomi and tries to drive away with his daughter but crashes his car in the driveway.\n\nLater, Jordan [[covert listening device|wears a wire]] to work but slips a note to Donnie, warning him. The FBI discovers this, arrests Jordan, and raids and shuts down Stratton Oakmont. Despite breaching his deal, Jordan receives a reduced sentence of 36 months in a [[minimum security prison]] for his testimony and is released in 2000 after serving 22 months. After his release, Jordan makes a living hosting seminars on sales techniques.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{cast list|\n* [[Leonardo DiCaprio]] as [[Jordan Belfort]]\n* [[Jonah Hill]] as Donnie Azoff\n* [[Margot Robbie]] as Naomi Lapaglia\n* [[Kyle Chandler]] as FBI Agent Patrick Denham\n* [[Rob Reiner]] as Max Belfort\n* [[Jon Bernthal]] as Brad Bodnick\n* [[Matthew McConaughey]] as Mark Hanna\n* [[Jon Favreau]] as Manny Riskin\n* [[Jean Dujardin]] as Jean-Jacques Saurel\n* [[Joanna Lumley]] as Aunt Emma\n* [[Cristin Milioti]] as Teresa Petrillo\n* [[Christine Ebersole]] as Leah Belfort\n* [[Shea Whigham]] as Captain Ted Beecham\n* [[Katarina \u010cas]] as Chantalle Bodnick\n* [[Stephanie Kurtzuba]] as Kimmie Belzer\n* [[P.
