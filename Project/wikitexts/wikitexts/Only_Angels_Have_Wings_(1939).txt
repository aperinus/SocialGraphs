It features supporting performances from [[Thomas Mitchell (actor)|Thomas Mitchell]], [[Richard Barthelmess]], [[Noah Beery Jr.]], and [[Rita Hayworth]], marking her first major role.<ref name= \"Articles\">Frankel, Mark.

Bonnie Lee, a piano-playing entertainer, arrives on a banana boat one day. After making her acquaintance, Joe Souther crashes and dies trying to land in fog later that day.  Bonnie becomes infatuated with Geoff, despite his [[fatalism|fatalistic]] attitude about the dangerous flying, and stays on in Barranca (''not'' at his invitation, as he insists on telling her).\n\nThe situation is complicated by the arrival of pilot Bat MacPherson and his wife (and Geoff's old flame) Judy. McPherson cannot find work in the United States because he once bailed out of an airplane, leaving his mechanic\u2014the brother of \"Kid\" Dabb, Carter's best friend\u2014to die in the ensuing crash.  When Geoff is forced to ground the Kid because of failing eyesight, he hires MacPherson on the understanding that he will get the most dangerous assignments.\n\nDutchy will secure a lucrative government contract if he can provide reliable mail service during a six-month trial. On the last day of the probation period, bad weather closes the mountain pass. Geoff decides to try to fly a new [[Ford Trimotor]] over the mountains instead. The Kid asks to go with him as co-pilot. Geoff refuses, but then lets the Kid toss a coin to decide the matter. When it lands on the floor, Geoff discovers that the coin has two heads. Geoff still agrees to take him along. Just before leaving, Bonnie tries to talk Geoff out of going.  She takes his gun out of his holster and points it at him.  When she realizes that she cannot stop him, she drops the gun on the table, but it accidentally fires, hitting Geoff in the shoulder.\n\nUnable to fly, Geoff lets MacPherson take his place. However, MacPherson and the Kid are unable to climb high enough; the plane stalls and drops thousands of feet before leveling off. Geoff tells them to turn around, but they decide to try to fly through the fogged-in pass. In the pass, they encounter a flock of [[condor]]s. One crashes through the windshield, paralyzing the Kid; another hits the No. 1 engine, setting it on fire. Later the No. 2 engine also catches fire. The Kid tells MacPherson to bail out, but he refuses. He turns around and returns to Barranca, managing to crash-land the burning Trimotor on the field. The Kid dies from a broken neck, but not before telling Geoff what MacPherson did. As a result, MacPherson is finally accepted by the other pilots.\n\nBonnie is torn between leaving and staying, and confronts Geoff in the hope he will ask her to stay. However, with mere hours to spare on the trial period, the weather clears and Geoff has to rush off to secure the all-important contract. Before he goes, he offers to toss a coin to decide: heads, Bonnie stays; tails, she leaves. The coin comes up heads, but Bonnie despairs that this is the result of chance, not love. Geoff leaves her with the coin. She then realizes that it is the Kid's trick coin, dispelling her sadness.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Only Angels Have Wings.jpg|thumb|350px|right|Promotional photo of Richard Barthelmess, Cary Grant and Thomas Mitchell]]\n\n{{col-begin|width=56%}}{{col-break}}\n* [[Cary Grant]] as Geoff Carter\n* [[Jean Arthur]] as Bonnie Lee\n* [[Richard Barthelmess]] as Bat MacPherson\n* [[Rita Hayworth]] as Judy MacPherson\n* [[Thomas Mitchell (actor)|Thomas Mitchell]] as \"Kid\" Dabb\n* [[Allyn Joslyn]] as Les Peters\n* [[Sig Ruman]] as John \"Dutchy\" Van Ruyter\n* [[Victor Kilian]] as \"Sparks\" Reynolds\n* [[John Carroll (actor)|John Carroll]] as \"Gent\" Shelton\n{{col-break}}\n* [[Don \"Red\" Barry|Don Barry]] as \"Tex\" Gordon\n* [[Noah Beery Jr.]] as Joe Souther\n* Manuel \u00c1lvarez Maciste as the singer\n* Milissa Sierra as Lily\n* Lucio Villegas as Doctor\n* [[Pat Flaherty (actor)|Pat Flaherty]] as Mike\n* [[Pedro Regas]] as Pancho\n* [[Pat West (actor)|Pat West]] as Baldy\n{{col-end}}\n\n==Production==\n\n===Pre-production and casting===\nThe film's original script outline was written by Anne Wigton; the working title originally was ''Plane No. 4''.

Barthelmess's career had gradually diminished since [[sound films]] became popular in the late 1920s, and he was a controversial choice, mainly because he had recently had a botched plastic surgery operation on the skin under his eyes that resulted in permanent X-shaped scars under both of his eyes. Barthelmess usually wore heavy make-up to hide the scars, but Hawks wanted to use the scars for the character.{{sfn|McCarthy|1997|p=270}}\n\nHawks had originally cast [[Dorothy Comingore]] in the role of Judy MacPherson, but studio head [[Harry Cohn]] had been grooming a young starlet that would be advanced for the role. With backing from Cohn, her agent then insisted that Hawks give Rita Hayworth a screen test, which eventually resulted in Hayworth being cast in the role.{{sfn|McCarthy|1997|p=271}}{{#tag:ref|Although Rita Hayworth had already appeared in a dozen films with [[Columbia Pictures|Columbia]], she had not made much of an impact until her role in ''Only Angels Have Wings''.<ref name= \"Articles\"/>|group=N}}\n\n===Filming===\nShooting of ''Only Angels Have Wings'' began on December 19, 1938 at the Columbia Studio Ranch{{sfn|McCarthy|1997|p=271}} and Hawks shot the film in chronological sequence whenever possible.{{sfn|McCarthy|1997|p=272}} Hawks and Arthur initially found working together difficult and Arthur would often argue with Hawks on set.<ref name= \"Articles\"/> Hawks was attempting to coach Arthur to play a variation of the classical \"Hawksian Woman Archetype\", but Arthur often felt uncomfortable with his direction.{{sfn|Oller|1997|p=112}} Eventually, she unhappily agreed to play the role as he directed her. Years later after Arthur saw [[Lauren Bacall]]'s performance in ''[[To Have and Have Not (film)|To Have and Have Not]]'', Arthur apologized to Hawks and told him that she finally understood what he had wanted from her (epitomized in Bacall's repetition and emphasis on the paradoxical line \"I'm hard to get ... all you have to do is ask me.\") Hawks later said that he considered Arthur to have been good in the film.{{sfn|McCarthy|1997|p=272}}\n\nInitial shooting was completed on March 24, 1939, 31 days over its shooting schedule. This was followed with several weeks of second unit shooting of aircraft flying in various locations in the western United States.

Two days of re-shoots with Rita Hayworth were also shot, but were directed by [[Charles Vidor]].{{sfn|McCarthy|1997|p=274}}\n\nIn a 1972 interview, Arthur revealed, \"I loved sinking my head into Cary Grant's chest\".<ref>Flatley, Guy.

The Metalplane was the airplane Joe Souther crashes while trying to land in heavy fog, and was only used for ground shots. In 2007, one of the Hamilton props used in the simulated flying scenes for this aircraft surfaced on an episode of ''[[Antiques Roadshow]]''; its owner had been able to screen match it, confirming its authenticity.<ref>[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/roadshow/archive/200706A37.html \" 'Only Angels Have Wings' Model Plane.\"] ''Roadshow Archive,'' 2008.

Its official world premiere occurred the next day at [[Radio City Music Hall]]. It was heavily promoted by Columbia Studios and ended up making $143,000 on its initial two-week run at radio City Music Hall, and earned over one million dollars overall. It was the third-highest-grossing film of 1939. The film was also Rita Hayworth's breakout role and helped make her a major Hollywood star, with Hayworth appearing on the cover of [[Look (American magazine)|''Look'' magazine]] after the film's success.{{sfn|McCarthy|1997|p=275}}\n\n''Only Angels Have Wings'' received good reviews on its release, with Abel Green of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' comparing it favorably to ''[[Flight From Glory]]'' and praised Barthelmess's performance. Frank S. Nugent in his review for ''[[The New York Times]]'' focused on the excitement found in the aerial scenes, also recognizing the talents of the star-studded cast, \"Mr. Hawks has staged his flying sequences brilliantly ...
