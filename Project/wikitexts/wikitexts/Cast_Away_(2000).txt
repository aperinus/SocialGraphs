Hanks plays a [[FedEx]] troubleshooter stranded on an [[desert island|uninhabited island]] after his plane crashes in the [[Pacific Ocean|South Pacific]], and the plot focuses on his desperate attempts to survive and return home. Initial filming took place from January to March 1999 before resuming in April 2000 and concluding that May.\n\n''Cast Away'' was released on December 22, 2000, by [[20th Century Fox]] in North America and [[DreamWorks Pictures]] in its international markets. It grossed $429&nbsp;million worldwide, making it the [[2000 in film#Highest-grossing films|third-highest-grossing film of 2000]]. The film received generally positive reviews from critics, who praised its screenplay and Hanks' performance, for which he won [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor \u2013 Motion Picture Drama|Best Actor \u2013 Motion Picture Drama]] at the [[58th Golden Globe Awards]] and was nominated for [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor in a Leading Role]] at the [[73rd Academy Awards]].<ref name=\"nytimes.com\">{{cite news|last=Kehr|first=Dave|date=December 17, 2000|title='Cast Away' Director Defies Categorizing|newspaper=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/12/17/movies/film-cast-away-director-defies-categorizing.html|access-date=October 18, 2012|archive-date=June 22, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180622140133/https://www.nytimes.com/2000/12/17/movies/film-cast-away-director-defies-categorizing.html|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n== Plot ==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for featured films are set between 400-700 words. -->\nIn 1995, Chuck Noland, a [[systems analyst]] executive, travels the world resolving productivity problems at [[FedEx|Federal Express]] depots. He lives with his girlfriend, Kelly Frears, in [[Memphis, Tennessee]]. The couple wants to get married, but Chuck's busy schedule prevents it.\nDuring a family Christmas dinner, Chuck is summoned to resolve a work problem in [[Malaysia]]. The Federal Express cargo plane he is on gets caught in a violent storm and crashes into the [[Pacific Ocean]]. Chuck is the only survivor of the crash and escapes with an inflatable life raft, losing the [[Emergency position-indicating radiobeacon|emergency locator transmitter]] in the process. The next day, he washes up on an uninhabited island.\n\nOver the next few days, several Federal Express packages wash ashore, as well as the corpse of one of the Federal Express pilots, whom Chuck buries. Chuck tries to signal a passing ship and escape in the damaged life raft, but the incoming surf tosses him onto a [[coral reef]], injuring his leg. He finds sufficient food, water, and shelter. Chuck opens most of the packages, finding several useful items, but does not open a package with a pair of golden angel wings painted on it. While attempting to [[Fire plough|start a fire]], Chuck cuts his hand. He furiously throws several objects from the packages, including a [[Wilson Sporting Goods]] [[Volleyball (ball)|volleyball]], leaving a bloodstained handprint. After calming down, Chuck draws a face into the smeared blood, names the ball Wilson, and begins talking to it. He continues to talk to it regularly during the rest of his time on the island.\n\nFour years later, in 1999, a now long-haired, bearded, and gaunt Chuck has moved into a cave. After a large section from a [[portable toilet]] enclosure washes up on the island, he builds a raft, using the plastic as a sail. Chuck successfully launches the raft that he has stocked with water and the unopened Federal Express package. Chuck and the raft survive a storm, but afterward, Wilson falls off the raft and floats away. Chuck awakens and futilely attempts to rescue Wilson but is left to grieve over his loss. Soon after, he is rescued by a passing container ship.\n\nUpon returning to civilization, Chuck learns that he was [[declared dead]] by his family and friends. Later, a spruced-up and clean-shaven Chuck returned to a hero\u2019s welcome home party at the Federal Express Headquarters in Memphis. Kelly has since married and has a daughter. Chuck goes to Kelly's house and reunites with her. They are both still in love with each other, but both know that Kelly cannot abandon her family. On a rainy night, she gives Chuck his old [[Jeep]], and they sadly part ways. Chuck drives to [[Texas]] to return the unopened Federal Express package to its sender. Finding no one home, he leaves the package at the door with a note saying that the package saved his life. He departs in his truck (where he has bought another Wilson volleyball and put it in the passenger seat) and stops at a remote crossroads. A woman in a pickup truck stops and gives information about where each road leads. As she drives away, Chuck notices an angel wing painted on the tailgate of her truck, identical to the one on the parcel. He looks down each road, trying to decide which way to go. In the end, Chuck then stares down the road the woman took and smiles.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{div col|colwidth=40em}}\n* [[Tom Hanks]] as Chuck Noland\n* [[Helen Hunt]] as Kelly Frears Lovett\n* [[Nick Searcy]] as Stan, Chuck's best friend and co-worker\n* [[Chris Noth]] as Jerry Lovett, Kelly's husband\n* [[Lari White]] as Bettina Peterson, the woman who sent the unopened FedEx package\n* [[Vince Martin (actor)|Vince Martin]] as Pilot Albert 'Al' Miller, who is buried by Chuck on the island\n* [[Michael Forest]] as Pilot Jack\n* [[Jay Acovone]] as Pilot Peter\n* Garret Davis as Pilot Blaine\n* [[Viveka Davis]] as Pilot Gwen\n* [[Jenifer Lewis]] as Becca Twig\n* [[Geoffrey Blake (actor)|Geoffrey Blake]] as Maynard Graham\n* [[Nan Martin]] as Kelly's Mother\n* [[Dennis Letts]] as Dennis Larson\n* [[Valerie Wildman]] as Virginia Larson\n* [[Steve Monroe]] as Steve Larson\n* [[Elden Henson]] as Elden Madden\n* [[Timothy Stack]] as Morgan Stockton\n* [[Joe Conley]] as Joe Wally\n* [[Frederick W.

It began on January 18, 1999 before halting two months later. Filming resumed on April 3, 2000, and finished the following month. Hanks gained {{convert|50|lb|kg}} during pre-production, for the purpose of making his transformation more dramatic. After most of the film was shot, production was paused so he could lose the weight and grow his hair and beard to look like he had been living on the island for years. Another four-month production halt preceded the filming of the return scenes. During the year-long hiatus, Zemeckis used the same film crew to make another film, ''[[What Lies Beneath]]''.<ref name=\"nytimes.com\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=https://catalog.afi.com/Film/61089-CAST-AWAY|title=Cast Away|publisher=American Film Institute|access-date=March 26, 2021|archive-date=September 14, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210914122359/https://catalog.afi.com/Film/61089-CAST-AWAY|url-status=live}}</ref> While the film was in production, Hanks nearly died when he suffered an infected cut on his leg.

The film's soundtrack is most notable for its lack of score and creature sound effects (such as bird song or insect sounds) while Chuck is on the island, which is intended to reinforce the feeling of isolation.<ref>''Cast Away'' DVD director's commentary</ref> ''Cast Away'' contains no original musical score until Chuck escapes the island. However, there is a Russian choral piece heard near the start of the film that was not composed or even recorded by Silvestri, so it does not appear on the film's soundtrack list. It is a traditional Russian song written by [[Lev Knipper]] called \"Oh, My Field\" [[Polyushko-polye|(\"Polyushko, Polye\")]] and it is available on various collections of Red Army hymns.\n\nThe official soundtrack CD is an anthology of musical pieces from all the films up to that point that were both directed by Zemeckis and scored by Silvestri.
