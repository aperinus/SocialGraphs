The trial occurs in the midst of deep [[anti-Japanese sentiment]]s following [[World War II]]. Covering the case is the editor of the town's one-man newspaper, Ishmael Chambers, a World War II veteran who lost an arm fighting the Japanese in the [[Pacific War]]. Ishmael struggles with his childhood, and continuing, love for Kabuo's wife, Hatsue, and his conscience, wondering if Kabuo is truly innocent.\n\nSpearheading the prosecution are the town's sheriff, Art Moran, and prosecutor, Alvin Hooks. Leading the defense is the old, experienced attorney Nels Gudmundsson. An underlying theme throughout the trial is prejudice. Several witnesses, including Carl's mother Etta, accuse Kabuo of murdering Carl for racial and personal reasons. This stance is not without irony, as Kabuo, a decorated war veteran of the [[442nd Infantry Regiment (United States)|442nd Regimental Combat Team]], experienced prejudice because of his ancestry following the [[Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor]]. By the same standard, Etta, a [[German American]], could be blamed for [[Nazi war crimes]].\n\nAlso involved in the trial is Ole Jurgensen, an elderly man who sold his strawberry field to Carl. The strawberry field is a contested issue during the trial. The land was originally owned by Carl Heine Sr. The Miyamotos lived in a house on the Heines' land and picked strawberries for Carl Sr.  Kabuo and Carl Jr. were close friends as children. Kabuo's father, Zenhichi, eventually approached Carl Sr. about purchasing {{convert|7|acre|m2}} of the farm. Though Etta opposed the sale, Carl Sr. agreed. The payments were to be made over a ten-year period. However, before the last payment was made, war erupted between the U.S. and Japan, and [[Japanese American internment|all islanders of Japanese ancestry were forced to relocate to internment camps]]. In 1944, Carl Sr. died and Etta sold the land to Ole. When Kabuo returned after the war, he was extremely bitter toward Etta for reneging on the land sale. When Ole suffered a stroke and decided to sell the farm, he was approached by Carl Jr., hours before Kabuo arrived, to try to buy the land back. During the trial, the land is presented as a family feud and the motivation behind Carl's murder.\n\nIshmael's search of the maritime records reveals on the night that Carl Heine died a freighter had passed through the channel where Carl had been fishing at 1:42am, five minutes before his watch had stopped. Ishmael realizes that Carl was thrown overboard by the force of the freighter's wake. Despite the bitterness he feels at Hatsue's rejection, Ishmael comes forward with the new information.  Further evidence is collected in support of the conclusion that Carl had climbed the boat's mast to cut down a lantern, been knocked from the mast by the freighter's wake, hit his head on his boat's gunwale, then fallen into the sea. The charges against Kabuo are dismissed. Hatsue thanks Ishmael by allowing him to hold her \"one last time.\"\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Ethan Hawke]] as Ishmael Chambers\n** [[Reeve Carney]] as young Ishmael\n* [[James Cromwell]] as Judge Fielding\n* [[Max von Sydow]] as Nels Gudmundsson\n* [[Youki Kudoh]] as Hatsue Miyamoto\n** [[Anne Suzuki]] as young Hatsue\n* [[Richard Jenkins]] as Sheriff Art Moran\n* [[James Rebhorn]] as Alvin Hooks\n* [[Sam Shepard]] as Arthur Chambers\n* [[Rick Yune]] as Kabuo Miyamoto\n** Seiji Inouye as young Kabuo\n* [[Celia Weston]] as Etta Heine\n* [[Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa]] as Zenhichi Miyamoto\n* [[Eric Thal]] as Carl Heine Jr.\n* [[Arija Bareikis]] as Susan Marie Heine\n* [[Zeljko Ivanek]] as Dr. Whitman\n* [[Daniel von Bargen]] as Carl Heine Sr.\n* Akira Takayama as Hisao Imada\n* [[Ako (actress)|Ako]] as Fujiko Imada\n* [[Zak Orth]] as Deputy Abel Martinson\n* [[Caroline Kava]] as Helen Chambers\n* [[Jan Rube\u0161]] as Ole Jurgensen\n* Sheila Moore as Liesel Jurgensen\n* [[Saemi Nakamura]] as Sumiko Imada\n* Mika Fujii as Yukiko Imada\n* [[Henry O]] as Nagaishi\n}}\n\n==Production==\nFilming took place primarily in locations around [[British Columbia]], Canada and [[Washington (state)|Washington]] state.
