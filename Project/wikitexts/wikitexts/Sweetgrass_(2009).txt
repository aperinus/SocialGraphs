It was directed by [[Lucien Castaing-Taylor]], a [[Harvard]] [[anthropologist]], and produced by his wife [[Ilisa Barbash]]. The title derives from [[Sweet Grass County]], one of several in which the film was shot.\n\n==Production and premiere==\nRecording first began in the spring of 2001, when Barbash and Castaing-Taylor first heard of a family of Norwegian\u2010American sheepherders in Montana. These herders were among the last to trail their band of sheep long distances through Montana's mountains.<ref>[http://sweetgrassthemovie.com/recordists-statement/ Recordist\u2019s Statement | Sweetgrass<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> After 8 years of filming and development, it premiered at the [[59th Berlin International Film Festival]]. Since then it has regularly screened worldwide and distributed theatrically by [[Cinema Guild]].
