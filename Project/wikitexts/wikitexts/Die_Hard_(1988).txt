Based on the 1979 novel, ''[[Nothing Lasts Forever (Thorp novel)|Nothing Lasts Forever]]'', by [[Roderick Thorp]], it stars [[Bruce Willis]], [[Alan Rickman]], [[Alexander Godunov]], and [[Bonnie Bedelia]].  ''Die Hard'' follows New York City police detective [[John McClane]] (Willis) who is caught up in a terrorist takeover of a Los Angeles skyscraper while visiting his estranged wife. [[Reginald VelJohnson]], [[William Atherton]], [[Paul Gleason]], and [[Hart Bochner]] feature in supporting roles.\n\nStuart was hired by [[20th Century Fox]] to adapt Thorp's novel into a screenplay in 1987. His finished draft was [[greenlit]] immediately by Fox, which was eager for a [[Blockbuster (entertainment)|summer blockbuster]] the following year. The role of McClane was turned down by a host of the decade's most popular actors, including [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] and [[Sylvester Stallone]]. Known mainly for work on television, Willis was paid $5{{nbsp}}million for his involvement, placing him among Hollywood's highest-paid actors. The deal was seen as a poor investment by industry professionals and attracted significant controversy towards the film prior to its release. Filming took place between November 1987 and March 1988, on a $25{{nbsp}}million\u2013$35{{nbsp}}million budget and almost entirely on location in and around [[Fox Plaza (Los Angeles)|Fox Plaza]] in Los Angeles.\n\nExpectations for ''Die Hard'' were low; some marketing efforts omitted Willis's image, ostensibly because the marketing team determined that the setting was as important as McClane. Upon its release in July 1988, initial reviews were mixed: criticism focused on its violence, plot, and Willis's performance, while McTiernan's direction and Rickman's charismatic portrayal of the villain [[Hans Gruber (character)|Hans Gruber]] were praised. Defying predictions, ''Die Hard'' grossed approximately $140{{nbsp}}million, becoming the year's tenth-highest-grossing film and the highest-grossing action film. Receiving four [[61st Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nominations, it elevated Willis to leading-man status and made Rickman a celebrity.\n\n''Die Hard'' has been critically re-evaluated and is now considered one of the [[List of films considered the best#Action|greatest action films]], and is also often named one of the [[List of films considered the best#Christmas|best Christmas films]]. It revitalized the action genre, largely due to its depiction of McClane as a vulnerable and fallible protagonist, in contrast to the muscle-bound and invincible heroes of other films of the period. Retrospective commentators also identified and analyzed its thematic concerns, including vengeance, masculinity, gender roles, and American anxieties over foreign influences. The film produced a host of imitators; the term \"''Die Hard''\" became a shorthand for plots featuring overwhelming odds in a restricted environment, such as \"''Die Hard'' on a bus\". It created a [[Die Hard (film series)|franchise]] comprising the sequels ''[[Die Hard 2]]'' (1990), ''[[Die Hard with a Vengeance]]'' (1995), ''[[Live Free or Die Hard]]'' (2007), and ''[[A Good Day to Die Hard]]'' (2013), plus [[Die Hard (film series)#Video games|video games]], comics, and other merchandise. Deemed \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\" by the United States [[Library of Congress]], ''Die Hard'' was selected for preservation in the [[National Film Registry]] in 2017.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- PER WP:FILMPLOT, PLOT SUMMARIES FOR FEATURE FILMS SHOULD BE BETWEEN 400 AND 700 WORDS. -->\nOn Christmas Eve, [[New York City Police Department]] (NYPD) Detective [[John McClane]] arrives in Los Angeles, hoping to reconcile with his estranged wife, Holly, at a party held by her employer, the Nakatomi Corporation. He is driven to Nakatomi Plaza by a limo driver, Argyle, who offers to wait for McClane in the garage. While McClane changes clothes, the tower is seized by German radical [[Hans Gruber (character)|Hans Gruber]] and his heavily armed team, including Karl and Theo. Everyone in the tower is taken hostage except for McClane, who slips away, and Argyle, who remains oblivious to events.\n\nGruber is posing as a terrorist to steal the $640 million in untraceable [[bearer bond]]s in the building's vault. He kills executive Joseph Takagi after failing to extract the access code from him, and tasks Theo with breaking into the vault. The terrorists are alerted to McClane's presence and one of them, Tony, is sent after him. McClane kills Tony and takes his weapon and radio, which he uses to contact the skeptical [[Los Angeles Police Department]] (LAPD). Sergeant [[Al Powell]] is sent to investigate. Meanwhile, McClane kills more terrorists and recovers their bag of [[C-4 (explosive)|C-4]] and detonators. Having found nothing amiss, Powell is about to leave until McClane drops a terrorist's corpse onto his car. After Powell calls for backup, a [[SWAT]] team attempts to storm the building but is assaulted by the terrorists. McClane throws some C-4 down an elevator shaft, causing an explosion that kills some of the terrorists and ends the assault.\n\nHolly's co-worker Harry Ellis attempts to negotiate on Gruber's behalf, but when McClane refuses to surrender, Gruber kills Ellis. While checking the explosives on the roof, Gruber encounters McClane and pretends to be an escaped hostage; McClane gives Gruber a gun. Gruber attempts to shoot McClane but finds the weapon is unloaded, and is saved only by the intervention of other terrorists. McClane escapes but is injured by shattered glass and loses the detonators. Outside, [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) agents take control. They order the power to be shut off which, as Gruber had anticipated, disables the final vault lock so his team can collect the bonds.\n\nThe FBI agrees to Gruber's demand for a helicopter, intending to send gunship helicopters to eliminate the group. McClane realizes Gruber plans to blow the roof to kill the hostages and fake his team's deaths. Karl, enraged by the death of his brother Tony, attacks McClane and is seemingly killed. Gruber sees a news report by Richard Thornburg on McClane's children and deduces that he is Holly's husband. The hostages are taken to the roof while Gruber keeps Holly with him. McClane drives the hostages from the roof just before Gruber detonates it and destroys the approaching FBI helicopters. Meanwhile, Theo retrieves an escape vehicle from the parking garage but is knocked out by Argyle, who has been following events on his car radio.\n\nA weary and battered McClane finds Holly with Gruber and his remaining henchman. McClane surrenders to Gruber and is about to be shot, but grabs his concealed service pistol taped to his back and uses his last two bullets to wound Gruber and kill his accomplice. Gruber crashes through a window but grabs onto Holly's wristwatch and makes a last-ditch attempt to kill the pair before McClane unclasps the watch and Gruber falls to his death. Outside, Karl ambushes McClane and Holly but is shot dead by Powell. Holly punches Thornburg when he attempts to interview McClane before Argyle crashes through the parking garage door in the limo and drives McClane and Holly away together.\n\n==Cast==\n{{multiple image|total_width=350\n | direction = horizontal\n | alt footer= Head shots of Bruce Willis and Alan Rickman |footer = [[Bruce Willis]] in 2018 (left) and [[Alan Rickman]] in 2011\n | image1 = Bruce Willis by Gage Skidmore 3.jpg\n | image2 = Alan Rickman cropped and retouched.jpg\n}}\n* [[Bruce Willis]] as [[John McClane]], a New York City police detective<ref name=\"ReviewLATimes\"/>\n* [[Alan Rickman]] as [[Hans Gruber (character)|Hans Gruber]], the ruthless leader of the terrorists<ref name=\"ReviewNYT\"/>\n* [[Alexander Godunov]] as Karl, Gruber's second-in-command<ref name=\"ReviewLATimes\"/>\n* [[Bonnie Bedelia]] as Holly Gennaro-McClane, a high-ranking Nakatomi executive and John's estranged wife<ref name=\"NewYorkerThemes\"/>\n* [[Reginald VelJohnson]] as [[Al Powell]], an LAPD sergeant<ref name=\"ReviewDesson\"/>\n* [[Paul Gleason]] as Dwayne T.

His script purchased by [[Columbia Pictures]] had been abandoned and a contract at [[Walt Disney Pictures]] was not providing him with sufficient income. Stuart had six weeks between contracted work so his agent [[Jeremy Zimmer]] contacted [[Lloyd Levin]], the head of development at the Gordon Company, a producing arm of [[20th Century Fox]].<ref name=\"VarietyBook\"/>\n\nLevin asked Stuart to work on an adaptation of the 1978 novel ''[[Nothing Lasts Forever (Thorp novel)|Nothing Lasts Forever]]'' written by former police officer [[Roderick Thorp]].<ref name=\"VarietyBook\"/><ref name=Independent1/> Thorp had been inspired to write ''Nothing Lasts Forever'' by a dream he had\u2014in which armed assailants chase a man through a building\u2014after watching the 1974 disaster film ''[[The Towering Inferno]]''.<ref name=\"VarietyBook\"/><ref name=\"VanityFairat30\"/> Fox had adapted the book's 1966 predecessor, ''[[The Detective (novel)|The Detective]]'', for the [[The Detective (1968 film)|1968 film]] starring [[Frank Sinatra]] as NYPD detective Joe Leland, and purchased the sequel rights before ''Nothing Lasts Forever'' had been written.<ref name=\"VarietyBook\"/><ref name=\"VanityFairat30\"/>\n\nLevin gave Stuart creative freedom as long as he retained the Christmas-in-Los-Angeles setting; the concept, he considered, would provide an interesting aesthetic.<ref name=\"VarietyBook\"/> The film was pitched as \"[[John Rambo|Rambo]] in an office building\", referring to the successful ''[[Rambo (franchise)|Rambo]]'' film series.<ref name=\"EbertSeitz\"/> Producers [[Lawrence Gordon (producer)|Lawrence Gordon]] and [[Joel Silver]] hired director [[John McTiernan]] because of his work with them on the successful 1987 action film ''[[Predator (1987 film)|Predator]]''.<ref name=\"NYTimesSalaryAftermath\"/><ref name=\"VultureRetro\"/><ref name=\"EmpireRetro\"/> McTiernan agreed to direct on the condition that the film would have \"some joy\" and not simply contain \"mean, nasty acts\", seen in other terrorist films.<ref name=\"VanityFairat30\"/>\n\nStuart began working 18-hour days at his office at [[Walt Disney Studios (Burbank)|Walt Disney Studios]] in [[Burbank, California|Burbank]], which left him exhausted and \"on edge\".<ref name=\"VarietyBook\"/> After an argument with his wife, he went for a drive and saw a box in his lane; unable to avoid it, he was forced to drive over it and discovered it to be empty. According to Stuart, he pulled over on the side of the freeway, his \"heart pounding\". From this, Stuart conceived a central theme of the story of a man who should have apologized to his wife before a catastrophe. He returned home to reconcile with his wife and wrote 35 pages that night.<ref name=\"VarietyBook\"/> To shape the McClanes' relationship, Stuart also drew upon the marital problems of his peers, including divorces and ex-wives reverting to use their maiden name.<ref name=\"VarietyBook\"/>\n\n[[File:Disney studios burbank team disney building buena vista.jpg|thumb|alt=Walt Disney Studios in Burbank, California.|[[Jeb Stuart (writer)|Jeb Stuart]] wrote his initial draft in his office at the [[Walt Disney Studios (Burbank)|Walt Disney Studios]] in [[Burbank, California]].]]\nJohn McClane was named John Ford initially, but 20th Century Fox felt this was disrespectful to the deceased director [[John Ford|of the same name]]. Stuart chose McClane as a \"good strong Scottish name\", based on his own Celtic heritage. He described the character as a flawed hero who learns a lesson in the worst possible situation and becomes a better, but not a different, person.<ref name=\"VarietyBook\"/> Having no experience writing action films, Stuart drew on his experience writing thrillers, focusing on making the audience care about McClane, Holly, and their reconciliation.<ref name=\"VarietyBook\"/> As Stuart pitched his story to executives, Gordon interrupted him, told him to complete a draft, and left the meeting. Stuart finished his first draft just under six weeks later.<ref name=\"VarietyBook\"/>\n\nStuart credits Levin for helping him understand ''Nothing Lasts Forever''.<ref name=\"VarietyBook\"/> He adapted many sequences faithfully, including a C-4 charge being thrown down an elevator shaft and the central character, Joe Leland, leaping from the roof. However, the novel is told entirely from Leland's perspective, and events he is not present for are not detailed.<ref name=\"VarietyBook\"/><ref name=\"CreativeScreenwriting\"/><ref name=\"AVNovel\"/> Its tone is also more cynical and [[Nihilism|nihilistic]]: Leland visits his drug-addicted daughter at the Klaxon building, and she dies having fallen from the building alongside villain Anton Gruber, who is using na\u00efve male and female guerrilla soldiers to rob the building because of Klaxon's support for a dictatorial government. This made their motivations less clear and Leland more conflicted about killing them, especially the women. Leland is written as an experienced older man working as a high-powered security consultant.<ref name=\"VarietyBook\"/><ref name=\"EmpireRetro\"/><ref name=\"AVNovel\"/> Stuart rejected the novel's tone for being \"too sad\", and believed an older action hero\u2014Leland being over 60\u2014was nonsensical. Stuart created new material for scenes when McClane is not present, expanding upon or introducing characters: he gave Powell a wife and children, allowing him to relate more closely to McClane; and Argyle, who disappears early in the novel, is present throughout Stuart's draft, supporting McClane by broadcasting rap music over the terrorists' radios. Among the script's original characters is the unscrupulous journalist Richard Thornburg.<ref name=\"VarietyBook\"/>\n\nA fan of prominent Western film actor [[John Wayne]], Stuart was inspired to carry a Western theme throughout the script, including cowboy lingo. He befriended a construction superintendent at the under-construction [[Fox Plaza (Los Angeles)|Fox Plaza]] in Los Angeles, allowing him access to the building to gain ideas on how to lay out the characters and scenes. He delivered the finished screenplay in June 1987. It was [[Green-light|greenlit]] the following day, in part because 20th Century Fox needed a [[Blockbuster (entertainment)|summer blockbuster]] for 1988.<ref name=\"VarietyBook\"/>\n\n===Casting===\n[[File:Bonnie Bedelia 1974.JPG|upright|left|thumb|alt=Portrait of Bonnie Bedelia looking directly at the camera |Actress [[Bonnie Bedelia]] in 1974. She was chosen by Willis to portray Holly Gennero-McClane after he saw her performance in ''[[Heart Like a Wheel (film)|Heart Like a Wheel]]'' (1983).]]\nAs ''Die Hard'' was based on the novel sequel to ''The Detective'' film, the studio was contractually obligated to offer Frank Sinatra the role. Sinatra, who was 70 at the time, declined.<ref name=Independent1/><ref name=\"VanityFairat30\"/><ref name=\"EmpireRetro\"/> The role was offered to various major stars including [[Sylvester Stallone]], [[Richard Gere]], [[Clint Eastwood]], [[Harrison Ford]],<ref name=\"VultureRetro\" /><ref name=\"DevOtherActors\" /> [[Burt Reynolds]],<ref name=\"CastReynolds\" /> [[Nick Nolte]], [[Mel Gibson]], [[Don Johnson]], [[Richard Dean Anderson]],<ref name=\"Independent1\" /> [[Paul Newman]],<ref name=\"CastNewman\" /> [[James Caan]],<ref name=\"DailyBeastCaan\" /> and [[Al Pacino]].<ref name=\"AlPacino\"/> The prevailing action archetype of the era was a muscle-bound, invincible macho man like [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]], who was offered the role, but he wanted to branch out into comedy and turned it down to star in ''[[Twins (1988 film)|Twins]]'' (1988).<ref name=Independent1/> Willis was known mainly for his comedic role in the romantic comedy television series ''[[Moonlighting (TV series)|Moonlighting]]'', starring opposite [[Cybill Shepherd]]. He declined the role because of his contractual obligations to ''Moonlighting'', but when Shepherd became pregnant, the show's production was stopped for eleven weeks, giving Willis enough time to take the role.<ref name=Independent1/>\n\nMcTiernan's girlfriend had a chance meeting with a representative of [[CinemaScore]] and asked them for analysis of Willis as the star. Their analysis showed that casting Willis would not have a negative impact; his participation was confirmed two weeks later.<ref name=\"lawrence20160830\"/> The choice was controversial as Willis had only starred in one other film, the moderately successful comedy ''[[Blind Date (1987 film)|Blind Date]]'' (1987).<ref name=Independent1/><ref name=\"LATimesJuly03\"/> At the time, there was also a clear distinction between film and television actors. Though films like ''[[Ghostbusters]]'' (1984) had demonstrated that television stars could lead a blockbuster film, other television actors like [[Shelley Long]] and [[Bill Cosby]] had failed in their recent attempts to make the transition.<ref name=\"VultureRetro\"/><ref name=\"VultureJul16\"/>\n\nWillis received $5{{nbsp}}million for the role, giving him a salary comparable to more successful, established film actors like [[Dustin Hoffman]], [[Warren Beatty]], and [[Robert Redford]].<ref name=\"NYTimesSalaryAftermath\" /> 20th Century Fox president [[Leonard Goldberg]] justified the figure by saying ''Die Hard'' needed an actor of Willis's potential,<ref name=\"NYTimesSalaryAftermath\"/> and Gordon said that Willis's [[everyman]] persona was essential to conveying the idea that the hero could actually fail.<ref name=\"NYTimesPostRelease\"/> Other Fox sources were reported as saying the studio was desperate for a star after being turned down by so many popular actors.<ref name=\"DevWillisSalary\"/> Willis said, \"They paid me what they thought I was worth for the film, and for them.\"<ref name=\"CloserWillis\"/> He described the character as unlike the larger-than-life characters portrayed by Stallone or Schwarzenegger, saying \"even though he's a hero, he is just a regular guy. He's an ordinary guy who's been thrown into extraordinary circumstances\".<ref name=\"LATimesJuly03\"/> Willis drew upon his working-class upbringing in [[South Jersey]] for the character, including \"that attitude and disrespect for authority, that [[Black comedy|gallows sense of humor]], the reluctant hero\".<ref name=Independent1/>\n\nRickman was already in his early 40s as he made his screen debut as Hans Gruber. He was cast by Silver, who had seen him perform in a Broadway version of ''[[Les Liaisons Dangereuses (play)|Les Liaisons Dangereuses]]'', playing the villainous Vicomte de Valmont.<ref name=Independent1/><ref name=\"LegacyEmpire\"/> Bedelia was cast at Willis's suggestion after he saw her in the 1983 biographical film ''[[Heart Like a Wheel (film)|Heart Like a Wheel]]''.<ref name=\"StartTVBedelia\"/> VelJohnson appeared as Al Powell in his first major film role at the suggestion of casting director Jackie Burch, with whom he had worked previously. [[Robert Duvall]], [[Gene Hackman]], [[Laurence Fishburne]], and [[Wesley Snipes]] were considered for the role.<ref name=\"SlashFilmVelJohnson\"/><ref name=\"MaximVelJohnson\"/><ref name=\"SlashSnipes\"/> Ellis is portrayed by Hart Bochner, an acquaintance of Silver. His role was shot in chronological order over three weeks. McTiernan had wanted the character to be suave like actor [[Cary Grant]], but Bochner conceived of the character's motivations coming from cocaine use and insecurity. McTiernan hated the performance initially until he noticed Gordon and Silver were entertained by Bochner's antics.<ref name=\"CastBochner\"/>\n\n===Re-write===\n[[File:Roy Rogers in The Carson City Kid.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Roy Rogers dressed in cowboy gear. | [[John McClane]]'s catchphrase \"Yippee-ki-yay, motherfucker\" was inspired by western actor [[Roy Rogers]]'s (pictured) own \"Yippee-ki-yay, kids\".]]\nScreenwriter [[Steven E. de Souza]] rewrote Stuart's script, as he had experience in blending action and comedy.<ref name=\"SlashFilmSouza\"/> He approached the story as if Gruber is the protagonist. He said, \"If [Gruber] had not planned the robbery and put it together, [McClane] would have just gone to the party and reconciled or not with his wife. You should sometimes think about looking at your movie through the point of view of the villain who is really driving the narrative.\"<ref name=\"CreativeScreenwriting\"/> De Souza used blueprints of Fox Plaza to help him lay out the story and character locations within the building.<ref name=\"SlashFilmSouza\"/>\n\nThe script continued to undergo changes up to and during filming. Several subplots and traits for characters other than McClane were created during the first few weeks of filming because Willis was still working on ''Moonlighting''. He would film the show for up to ten hours and then work on ''Die Hard'' at night. McTiernan gave Willis time off to rest and tasked De Souza with adding the new scenes. These included scenes with Holly's housekeeper, Holly confronting Gruber following Takagi's death, an introductory scene for Thornburg, and more moments between Powell and his fellow officers.<ref name=\"SlashFilmSouza\"/>\n\nSilver wanted a scene between McClane and Gruber before the film's denouement but De Souza could not think of a plausible scenario until he happened to overhear Rickman affecting an American accent. He realized this would allow Gruber to disguise himself when he met McClane, and the earlier scene of Takagi's murder was reworked to conceal Gruber's identity from McClane. Due to the addition of the Gruber/McClane meeting scene, a different one in which McClane kills Theo was excised.<ref name=\"SlashFilmSouza\"/>\n\nIn Stuart's original script, ''Die Hard'' took place over three days, but McTiernan was inspired to have it take place over a single night like Shakespeare's ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]''. He did not want to use terrorists as the villains, as he considered them to be \"too mean\", and avoided focusing on the terrorists' politics in favor of making them thieves driven by monetary pursuits; he felt this would make it more suitable summer entertainment.<ref name=\"DevMisc\"/>\n\nMcClane's character was not fully realized until almost halfway through production. McTiernan and Willis had determined that McClane is a man who does not like himself much but is doing the best he can in a bad situation.<ref name=\"DevMisc\"/> McClane's catchphrase, \"Yipee-ki-yay, motherfucker\", was inspired by old cowboy lingo, including cowboy actor [[Roy Rogers]]'s own \"Yippee-ki-yah, kids\", to emphasize his all-American character.<ref name=Independent1/><ref name=\"CreativeScreenwriting\"/> There was a debate over whether to use \"Yippee-ki-yay, motherfucker\" or \"yippee-ti-yay, motherfucker\"; Willis endorsed the former.<ref name=Independent1/>\n{{-}}\n\n===Filming===\n[[File:Foxplaza la.jpg|thumb|left|upright|alt=A high-rise building known as Fox Plaza | [[Fox Plaza (Los Angeles)|Fox Plaza]]\u2014in [[Century City]], [[Los Angeles]]\u2014which served as the setting for Nakatomi Plaza]]\n[[Principal photography]] began in November 1987, and concluded by early March 1988, with an approximate $25\u2013$35{{nbsp}}million budget.<ref name=Independent1/><ref name=\"LATimesJuly03\"/><ref name=\"BOMGeneral\"/><ref name=\"NYTimesPreview\"/><ref name=\"LATimesFilming\"/><ref name=\"afi\"/>{{efn|The 1988 budget of $25\u2013$35{{nbsp}}million is equivalent to ${{Format price|{{Inflation|US|25000000|1988}}}}\u2013${{Format price|{{Inflation|US|35000000|1988}}}} in {{Inflation/year|US}}.}} Filming took place almost entirely in and around Fox Plaza in [[Century City]], situated on the [[Avenue of the Stars, Century City|Avenue of the Stars]].<ref name=\"EmpireRetro\"/><ref name=\"SlashDeBont\"/><ref name=\"Gizmodo\"/> The location was chosen late in production by [[production designer]] Jackson De Govia.<ref name=\"DevMisc\"/> A mostly unoccupied building was needed which the under-construction Fox Plaza offered;<ref name=\"SlashDeBont\"/> it was secured with two main conditions: no filming during the day and no damage from explosions.<ref name=\"EmpireRetro\"/>\n\nCinematographer [[Jan de Bont]] said the building's design was distinct, making it a character on its own, and clear views of the building were available from a distance, enabling establishing shots as McClane approaches it. The surrounding city could be seen from within the building, enhancing the realism.<ref name=\"SlashDeBont\"/> De Bont frequently used handheld cameras to film closer to the characters, creating a more cinematic \"intimacy\". Very little of the film was [[storyboard]]ed beforehand because De Bont believed intricate storyboarding made his job redundant. Instead, he and McTiernan would discuss that day's filming in detail, and the feeling or sensation they wanted to convey. De Bont was more concerned with creating a dramatic rather than an attractive shot. He cited the use of real flares in the film that generated unpredictable smoke and sometimes obscured the image.<ref name=\"SlashDeBont\"/>\n\nWillis's first day on set was on November{{nbsp}}2, 1987. He came straight from filming ''Moonlighting'' to shoot one of his most pivotal scenes, where McClane leaps from a rooftop as it explodes behind him, saved only by a length of firehose.<ref name=Independent1/> Willis found acting in ''Die Hard'' difficult because it differed from previous experiences in that he was often alone, not having any personal encounters with others.<ref name=\"CloserWillis\"/> He did not spend much time with the rest of the cast between takes, opting to spend it with his new partner, [[Demi Moore]]. In contrast to their on-screen dynamics, Bedelia and VelJohnson spent most of their time between scenes with Rickman.<ref name=\"PeopleBedelia\"/><ref name=\"VultureTidbits\"/> When asked to throw Holly to the floor, Rickman refused because he believed it was not a fitting action for the \"civilized\" Gruber and that Holly, \"a self-possessed career woman,\" would not have let him.<ref name=\"BBCRickmanObit\"/>\n\nThe film's ending had not been finalized when filming began. In the finished film, Theo retrieves an ambulance from the truck the terrorists arrived in to use as an escape vehicle, but as this was a late addition, the truck the terrorists had been filmed arriving in was too small to hold an ambulance. Another scene, showing the terrorists synchronizing their [[TAG Heuer]] watches, also showed the truck was empty; this scene had to be deleted, leading to other necessary changes. As scripted, McClane realizes that the American hostage he encounters is Gruber because of the distinctive TAG Heuer watch he observed on the other terrorists; the watches were no longer an established plot point.<ref name=\"DevMisc\"/><ref name=\"NMERetro\"/> It necessitated the introduction of a heroic scene for Argyle, who gets to stop Theo's escape.

The stunt involved a {{convert|25|ft|m|adj=on}} leap from a five-story parking garage ledge onto an airbag as a {{convert|60|ft|m|adj=on}} wall of flame exploded behind him.

It was shot approximately halfway into the filming schedule so that all involved had gained more stunt experience. The window was made of fragile [[sugar glass]] that took two hours to set up, and there were only a few takes for this reason. Instead of a hoist, a team of stuntmen positioned below the window dragged the hose and pulled Willis towards the edge, as they could better control Willis's fall if he went over.<ref name=\"VultureRoofStunt\"/> Editor Frank Urioste kept the scene where McClane falls down a ventilation shaft and catches onto a lower opening; Willis's stuntman accidentally fell further than intended.<ref name=\"DevMisc\"/> During a scene where McClane shoots a terrorist through a table, Willis suffered a permanent two-thirds hearing loss in his left ear caused by firing loud [[Blank (cartridge)|blank cartridges]] close to his head.<ref name=\"GuardianHearing\"/><ref name=\"RadioTimesHearing\"/>\n\nFor Gruber's fall from Nakatomi Plaza, Rickman was dropped between {{convert|20|and|70|ft|0}}; reports are inconsistent.<ref name=\"DevMisc\"/><ref name=\"SlashDeBont\"/><ref name=\"Thrillist\"/> He was suspended on a raised platform and dropped onto a [[Chroma key|blue screen]] airbag.<ref name=\"DevMisc\"/><ref name=\"Thrillist\"/> This allowed the background behind him to be composited with footage taken from Fox Plaza and falling confetti that looked like bearer bonds. Rickman had to fall backward onto the bag, something stuntmen avoid to control their fall.<ref name=\"Thrillist\"/> McTiernan convinced Rickman by demonstrating the stunt himself and falling onto a pile of cardboard boxes.<ref name=\"VultureRoofStunt\"/> Rickman was told he would be dropped on a count of three, but he was let go earlier to elicit a genuine look of surprise. McTiernan said, \"there's no way he could fake that\".<ref name=\"DevMisc\"/><ref name=\"VultureRoofStunt\"/> The first take was used, but McTiernan convinced Rickman to perform a second one as backup.<ref name=\"Thrillist\"/>\n\nCapturing the stunt was difficult because it was impossible for a human operator to refocus the camera fast enough to prevent the image from blurring as Rickman fell away.<ref name=\"VultureRoofStunt\"/> Supervised by visual effects producer [[Richard Edlund]], [[Boss Film Studios]] engineered an automated system using a computer that rapidly refocused the camera via a motor on its [[Manual focus|focus ring]].<ref name=\"Thrillist\"/> A wide-angle lens camera shooting at 270{{nbsp}}frames per second was used, creating footage that played 10 times slower than normal. Despite these innovations, the camera struggled to keep Rickman entirely in focus during his 1.5-second fall; the scene cuts away from Rickman as the usable footage runs out.

He controlled these to create more dynamic and dramatic lighting. This gave him the opportunity to use unusual light positioning.

Alexander Boon compared Odysseus's tale to John McClane's quest to rescue his wife from the terrorists.]]\n''Die Hard'' has been described by critics such as [[Richard Brody]] and Chris Hewitt as a story about obtaining redemption through violence. McClane comes to Los Angeles to save his marriage, but makes the same mistakes that drove Holly away; Brody and Hewitt suggest that it is only after McClane defeats the terrorists through violence that their marriage is seemingly reconciled.<ref name=\"NewYorkerThemes\"/><ref name=\"EmpireRetro\"/> Similarly, Powell is haunted after accidentally shooting a child and finds redemption by drawing his gun to shoot Karl.<ref name=\"NewYorkerThemes\"/> Several male characters who are driven by rage or ego suffer for it including the FBI agents, Karl, Ellis, and McClane who nearly loses Holly by showing off after shooting Gruber. Ebert notes the more even-tempered characters\u2014often African American\u2014fare better.<ref name=\"EbertSeitz\"/> McClane identifies himself as a Roman Catholic, a religion requiring penance to earn redemption. Brody said that McClane endures physical punishment, including his feet being cut by glass shards to create a bloody \"[[stigmata]]\". In making these sacrifices, he salvages his family. In this sense, McClane can be seen as a modern, working-class [[Jesus|Christ]]-like figure.<ref name=\"NewYorkerThemes\"/>\n\nAlexander Boon compares McClane violently reclaiming his wife to the Greek figure [[Odysseus]] slaughtering [[Suitors of Penelope|his wife's suitors]]. McClane is rewarded for his masculinity, despite demonstrating negative male traits.{{sfn|Boon|2005}} Jeffrey Brown believed McClane's undershirt emphasizes his masculine physical form. This outfit is worn by other action characters like Rambo, and females displaying masculine traits such as [[Rachel McLish]] (''[[Aces: Iron Eagle III]]'') and [[Linda Hamilton]] (''[[Terminator 2: Judgment Day]]'').{{sfn|Brown|1996|p=63\u201364}} Powell and Argyle are not McClane's physical equals but they prioritize relationships, and when called on to act, they succeed.{{sfn|Abele|2002|p=449}} McClane possesses an imposing physicality but is clumsy and reliant on improvisation, and succeeds only because of the relationships with his allies.{{sfn|Abele|2002|p=449}} It is McClane and Powell's relationship that is particularly instrumental to McClane's success. The pair share a non-romantic intimacy that enables McClane to confess his failings as a husband in a way he did not with Holly, allowing McClane to grow as a person.{{sfn|Sandell|1996|pp=28\u201329}}{{sfn|Parshall|1991}}{{sfn|Lucas|1996|p=52}} Gruber fails because he is isolated, self-interested, and sacrifices his team for his own survival.{{sfn|Parshall|1991}}\n\nPeter Parshall observed that McClane and Gruber are reflections of each other.{{sfn|Parshall|1991}} Brody contrasts McClane\u2014an all-American stereotype compared to Western cowboy stars like Roy Rogers, John Wayne and [[Gary Cooper]]\u2014to Gruber, a classically educated, European villain who refers to America as a \"bankrupt\" culture.<ref name=\"NewYorkerThemes\"/><ref name=\"EmpireRetro\"/> Elizabeth Abele wrote that when compared to the superheroes of the previous decade in films like ''[[Superman (1978 film)|Superman]]'' (1978) and ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]]'' (1981), McClane is portrayed as physically but realistically masculine, conveying the idea of a \"real man\" who possesses independent, intrinsic strength.{{sfn|Abele|2002|p=448}} According to Justin Chang and Mark Olsen, this can be seen as a response to [[Reaganism]]\u2014the political positions of [[President of the United States|United States president]] [[Ronald Reagan]]\u2014promoting values of the [[American dream]], self-reliance, initiative, and technological advancement.<ref name=\"LATimesHoldUp\"/>{{sfn|Crowe|2011|p=15\u201316}}\n\nWillis believes that if given the choice, McClane would pass the responsibility of dealing with the terrorists on to anyone else, but he is forced to serve as a reluctant hero.<ref name=Independent1/> When the character is introduced, he is wearing his wedding ring. Scott Tobias wrote this serves as a symbol of his marital commitment. Holly is presented as the opposite; she uses her maiden name and is not wearing her wedding ring. Instead, she is gifted a [[Rolex]] watch by her employers, serving as a symbol of her commitment to her job and the division in her marriage. When McClane unclasps the watch at the film's end to free Holly from Gruber's grasp, the totem of their separation is broken, and they appear to have reconciled.{{sfn|Lucas|1996|p=52}}<ref name=\"TheGuardianThemes\"/>\n\nParshall describes the negative portrayals of female characters in ''Die Hard''. They appear sexualized in [[Pin-up model|pin-up posters]], suggest drinking while pregnant, or are away from their families on Christmas Eve at a work function. Holly takes a position of authority following her boss's death, but that power is delegated to her by Gruber, and it is used in traditionally feminine ways, to care for her colleagues. Takagi is replaced in Holly's life with a different dominant male, McClane.{{sfn|Parshall|1991}} Darin Payne wrote that ''Die Hard'' reflects the contemporary decline of men as the main household earner as more women joined the workforce and [[Blue-collar worker|blue-collar]] jobs were being lost to foreign countries. In response, an American cowboy saves the day, rescuing his captured wife from a foreign-owned tower.{{sfn|Payne|2017|p=109}}\n\n''Die Hard'' has elements that are anti-government, anti-bureaucracy and anti-corporation.<ref name=\"NewYorkerThemes\"/><ref name=\"EmpireRetro\"/><ref name=\"VanityFairat30\"/> A terrorist asserts McClane cannot harm him because there are rules for policemen, rules he intends to exploit. McClane responds \"so my captain keeps telling me\", suggesting that he operates outside of bureaucratically approved procedures.<ref name=\"NewYorkerThemes\"/><ref name=\"VanityFairat30\"/> Brody wrote that the police often present a bigger obstacle than the terrorists. They believe they are in control of events, unaware the terrorists have already anticipated their every action.<ref name=\"NewYorkerThemes\"/> The police chief is portrayed as incompetent, and the FBI is shown to be indifferent to the lives of the hostages as long as they kill the terrorists.<ref name=\"NewYorkerThemes\"/><ref name=\"PopMatters\"/> McClane is an everyman fighting against terrorists who are dressed like elite big-city workers.<ref name=\"EmpireRetro\"/> As Ellis states, the only difference between the corporate employees and the terrorists is that he uses a pen and Gruber uses a gun.{{sfn|Parshall|1991}} The police, the FBI, and an intrusive journalist are each punished for standing in McClane's way.<ref name=\"EmpireRetro\"/> Parshall noted the Christmas setting can be seen as an attack on traditional societal values. The corporation hosts a party on Christmas Eve, keeping employees away from their families, and the villains cynically appropriate Christmas iconographies. By defeating them, McClane upholds tradition and defends society.{{sfn|Parshall|1991}}\n\nAlongside the mainly German group of terrorists, Nakatomi Plaza is owned by a Japanese corporation, and the hostages are American.<ref name=\"NewYorkerThemes\"/>{{sfn|Payne|2017|p=109}}{{sfn|Shivers|1995|p=16}} Brody identified this as reflecting American anxieties about foreign powers at a time when Japanese technology firms threatened to dominate the American technology industry.<ref name=\"NewYorkerThemes\"/>{{sfn|Crowe|2011|p=15\u201316}}{{sfn|Payne|2017|p=109}} When McClane prevails, the suggestion is that American ingenuity will prevail.{{sfn|Shivers|1995|p=16}} America's old enemies, Germany and Japan, are portrayed as having forsaken their integrity in the pursuit of financial gain.<ref name=\"ReviewCanby\"/> Dave Kehr said the film embodies a resentful 1980s \"blue-collar rage\" against feminists, [[yuppie]]s, the media, the authorities and foreign nationals.<ref name=\"ReviewChicagoTribune\"/> Brody notes that the film can also be considered progressive in its portrayal of its African American characters, as cast members VelJohnson, Gilyard, and White are featured in prominent and important roles.<ref name=\"NewYorkerThemes\"/>\n\n''The A.V. Club'' noted that unlike many other 1980s films, ''Die Hard'' is not an allegory for the [[Vietnam War]]. The film mocks the idea when one FBI agent remarks that their helicopter assault is reminiscent of the war; his partner responds that at the time he was only in [[middle school]].<ref name=\"AVClubRetro\"/> Even so, ''[[Empire (film magazine)|Empire]]'' believed the film references Vietnam by showcasing an ill-equipped local taking on highly equipped foreign invaders; this time America wins.<ref name=\"EmpireRetro\"/> Drew Ayers described the complex layout of Nakatomi Plaza as analogous to the concealing jungles of Vietnam.{{sfn|Ayers|2008|p=53}}\n\n==Legacy==\n=== Influence on the film industry ===\n[[File:Foxstudiosentrance.jpg|thumb|alt=Entrance to the studio lot of 20th Century Fox in Century City, California | The entrance of the Fox Studio Lot in [[Century City]], where a giant mural of [[John McClane]] crawling through a vent was erected as part of the film's 25th-anniversary celebration in 2013]]\nBefore ''Die Hard''{{'}}s release, action films often starred muscle-bound men like Schwarzenegger and Stallone, who portrayed invincible, infallible, catchphrase-spouting heroes in unrealistic settings. Willis's portrayal of John McClane redefined the action genre, presenting a normal person with an average physique completely counter to that archetype. He is failing, both personally and professionally, and serves as a vulnerable, identifiable hero who openly sobs, admits his fear of death, and sustains lasting damage. Importantly, his one-liners do not come from a place of superiority over his foes, but as a nervous reaction to the extreme situation in which he finds himself, which he is only able to overcome through enduring suffering and using his own initiative.<ref name=Independent1/><ref name=\"EmpireRetro\"/><ref name=\"AVNovel\"/><ref name=\"AVClubRetro\"/>\n\nSimilarly, Rickman's portrayal of Gruber redefined action villains who had previously been bland figures or eccentric madmen. Gruber ushered in the clever nemesis; he is an educated, intelligent villain, who serves as the antithesis of the hero.<ref name=\"EmpireRetro\"/> He has been referred to as one of the most iconic villains in the genre.<ref name=\"AVClubRetro\"/> ''Empire'' magazine called Gruber one of the finest villains since [[Darth Vader]]. Rickman described the role as a \"huge event\" in his life.<ref name=\"EmpireRetro\"/> Though other more typical 1980s-style action films were released, the genre gradually shifted to a focus on smaller, more confined settings, everyman heroes, and charming villains with competent plans.<ref name=\"AVClubRetro\"/>\n\n''Die Hard'' raised Willis from television stardom to worldwide recognition and brought fame to Rickman.<ref name=Independent1/> Willis's salary was seen as the peak of the 1980s bidding wars between new and old managers vying for jobs. ''The New York Times'' described it as the salary equivalent of an \"earthquake\" and [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM/UA]] chairman [[Alan Ladd Jr.]] said that it threw \"the business out of whack ... like everybody else in town, I was stunned.\" It was seen as the most substantial change to salaries since Dustin Hoffman was paid $5.5{{nbsp}}million to star in ''[[Tootsie]]'' (1982) at a time when top salaries ranged from $2{{nbsp}}million\u2013$3{{nbsp}}million. It was expected that salaries for major stars would increase significantly to ensure they were paid more than a newer star like Willis.<ref name=\"NYTimesSalaryAftermath\"/><ref name=\"LATimesSalaryAftermath\"/> McTiernan transitioned his success into directing an adaptation of one of his favorite novels, ''[[The Hunt for Red October (film)|The Hunt for Red October]]'' (1990).<ref name=\"NYTimesMcTiernan\"/> VelJohnson's performance resulted in his casting in the 1989\u20131998 sitcom ''[[Family Matters]]''.<ref name=\"SlashFilmVelJohnson\"/>\n\n===Cultural impact===\nIn 2017, ''Die Hard'' was selected by the United States [[Library of Congress]] to be preserved in the [[National Film Registry]] for being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".<ref name=\"NationalFilmRegistry\"/><ref name=\"LOC\"/> In July 2007, Bruce Willis donated the undershirt worn in the film to the [[National Museum of American History]] at the [[Smithsonian Institution]].<ref name=\"Smithsonian\"/> The blood and sweat-stained vest is considered iconic, an emblem of McClane's difference from archetypal, invincible heroes.<ref name=Independent1/> Fox Plaza has become a popular tourist attraction, although the building itself cannot be toured.<ref name=\"Gizmodo\"/> A floor used for filming became Ronald Reagan's office.

''A Good Day to Die Hard'' is considered the weakest entry in the series.<ref name=\"DOGRankings\"/><ref name=\"SequelsScreenRant\"/><ref name=\"RTGoodday\"/> Although Willis expressed interest in a sixth and final film, plans for a prequel film were cancelled following the [[acquisition of 21st Century Fox by Disney]] in 2017, and Willis retired from acting in 2022, after being diagnosed with [[aphasia]], a condition which affects his ability to communicate.<ref name=\"DOGSequels\"/><ref name=\"PolyGonSequel\"/><ref name=\"GuardianSequels\"/>\n\n''Die Hard'' remains the most critically acclaimed film in the series based on aggregated reviews.<ref name=\"RTSequels\"/> As the sequels progressed, they increasingly hewed closer to the 1980s-style action films ''Die Hard'' had eschewed, McClane becoming an invincible killing machine surviving damage that would have killed his original incarnation.<ref name=\"AVNovel\"/><ref name=\"EsquireSequels\"/> [[NPR]] called ''Die Hard'' a \"genuinely great\" movie whose legacy has been tarnished by lackluster sequels.<ref name=\"SequelsNPR\"/> According to ''The Guardian'', the evolution of the action genre can be tracked by the differences in each ''Die Hard'' sequel, as McClane evolves from human into a superhuman.<ref name=\"TheGuardianThemes\"/> A comic book prequel and sequel have been released: ''[[Die Hard: Year One]]'' is set in 1976 and chronicles McClane as a rookie officer; ''A Million Ways to Die Hard'' is set 30 years after ''Die Hard'', and features a retired McClane seeking out a serial killer.<ref
