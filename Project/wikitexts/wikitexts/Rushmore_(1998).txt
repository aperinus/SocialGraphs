The film was co-written by Anderson and [[Owen Wilson]]. The soundtrack features several songs by bands associated with the [[British Invasion]] of the 1960s. Filming began in November 1997 around [[Houston, Texas]], and lasted 50 days, until late January 1998.\n\nWhile the box office results were modest, the film had a positive reception among film critics. The film helped launch the careers of Wes Anderson and Schwartzman while establishing a \"second career\" for Murray as a respected actor in [[Independent film|independent cinema]]. At the 1999 [[Independent Spirit Awards]], Anderson won the Best Director award and Murray won Best Supporting Male award. Murray also earned a nomination for the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor \u2013 Motion Picture]]. Starting from ''Rushmore'', Murray became one of Anderson's most frequent collaborators, appearing in his eight subsequent films. In 2016, the film was selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] as being deemed \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".\n\n==Plot==\nAlthough eccentric, 15-year-old scholarship student Max Fischer participates extensively in extracurricular activities at the prestigious Rushmore Academy in [[Houston]], he struggles academically. Max's middle-class background, which contradicts the wealthy and privileged lives of most Rushmore students, feeds his determination to make his name known. Headmaster Nelson Guggenheim places him on \"sudden death academic probation\", warning him that if he fails one more class, he will be expelled. At a school assembly, Max meets Herman Blume, a disillusioned parent and local industrialist who despises his twin sons Ronny and Donny, both students at Rushmore. Herman befriends Max and takes him under his wing.\n\nUpon reading an intriguing written message left in a book he read in the library, Max tracks down the book's previous borrower, Rosemary Cross, a widowed first-grade teacher at Rushmore, and soon becomes obsessed with her. Attempting to woo her, he successfully petitions to have the Latin curriculum kept at Rushmore, and later confesses his love for her; she rejects his affection due to their age difference. Rosemary and others, including Max's younger friend Dirk Calloway, are impressed by Max's tenacity, while other students, including the brash and aggressive Magnus Buchan, resent Max's ability to manipulate authority, seemingly on a whim, to the point where the entire school body is affected. Max then attempts to court Rosemary by building an aquarium on the school's baseball field, noting her interest in marine life due to the fish tanks in her classroom and the library book by Jacques Cousteau they had both read, but is stopped by Guggenheim at the ground-breaking ceremony and subsequently expelled from Rushmore for having never sought the school's approval for the project.\n\nAfterwards, Max enrolls at Grover Cleveland High School, a local public school. Classmate Margaret Yang shows interest in him, but he ignores her. Eventually, Max begins to settle in and participate in extracurricular activities again, with Rosemary and Blume supporting him. Blume encourages him to give up pursuing Rosemary but eventually becomes attracted to her himself and they begin to see each other behind Max's back.\n\nEventually, Dirk discovers the relationship between Rosemary and Blume and informs him as payback for a rumor Max started about his mother. Max confronts Blume, declaring their friendship over, and they soon begin scrapping. Max informs Blume's wife of her husband's affair, forcing him to move into a hotel. Then he puts bees in Blume's room, leading to his running over Max's bicycle with his car. Max is eventually arrested for cutting the brake lines on Blume's car. He later attempts to get revenge on Rosemary by taking damaging photos of her and Blume together but learns from Guggenheim that she had already resigned. \n\nMax eventually gives up, meeting Blume at the grave of his mother Eloise, who died of cancer when Max was seven years old. He explains that revenge no longer matters because even if he wins, Rosemary would still love Blume. Max becomes reclusive and begins to skip school to work at his father Bert's barbershop. One day, Dirk stops by the shop to apologize, bringing him a Christmas present. He then reveals to Max that Guggenheim suffered a stroke, and suggests he visit him at the hospital, knowing Blume will also be there. Max and a washed-up Blume meet and are courteous. Blume tells him that Rosemary broke up with him because she's still in love with her dead husband Edward Appleby, a former Rushmore student, whose death the previous year directly influenced her decision to teach there. Max eventually returns to school and begins to improve his grades.\n\nTaking his final shot at Rosemary, Max pretends to be injured in a car accident, but she sees through his ruse and rebuffs him again. He then decides to help Blume and Rosemary reconcile, first by inviting her to another aquarium groundbreaking ceremony, but she does not show up. Max then invites both of them to attend his [[Vietnam War]]-themed play at Grover Cleveland. The performance touches Blume, himself a Vietnam veteran, and he and Rosemary later appear to reconcile. At the after-play party, Max reveals to Blume and Rosemary that he and Margaret are dating. Max and Rosemary then share a dance together.\n\n==Cast==\n{{multiple image\n | align     = right\n | direction = horizontal\n | footer    = [[Jason Schwartzman]] (in 2008) and [[Bill Murray]] (in 2012) star as Max and Blume.\n | footer_align = left\n | width     =\n | image1    =Coconut-Records (cropped).jpg\n | width1    = 150\n | alt1      =\n | image2    = Hyde Park on Hudson 11.jpg\n | width2    = 128\n | alt2      =\n}}\n* [[Jason Schwartzman]] as Max Fischer\n* [[Bill Murray]] as Herman Blume\n* [[Olivia Williams]] as Rosemary Cross\n* [[Seymour Cassel]] as Bert Fischer\n* [[Brian Cox (actor)|Brian Cox]] as Nelson Guggenheim\n* [[Mason Gamble]] as Dirk Calloway\n* [[Sara Tanaka]] as Margaret Yang\n* [[Connie Nielsen]] as Mrs. Calloway\n* [[Luke Wilson]] as Peter Flynn\n* [[Stephen McCole]] as Magnus Buchan\n* [[Kumar Pallana]] as Mr. Littlejeans\n* [[Andrew Wilson (actor)|Andrew Wilson]] as Coach Beck\n* [[Marietta Marich]] as Mrs. Guggenheim\n* [[Alexis Bledel]] as Student\n* [[Owen Wilson]] as Edward Appleby, Rosemary's deceased husband (photograph, uncredited)\n\n==Production==\nWith ''Rushmore'', Wes Anderson and Owen Wilson wanted to create their own \"slightly heightened reality, like a [[Roald Dahl]] children's book\".<ref name=\"Winters\">{{cite news | last = Winters | first = Laura | title = An Original at Ease in the Studio System | work = [[The New York Times]] | date = January 31, 1999 | url = https://www.nytimes.com/1999/01/31/movies/film-an-original-at-ease-in-the-studio-system.html | access-date = October 7, 2008 }}</ref> Like Max Fischer, Wilson was expelled from his preparatory school, [[St. Mark's School of Texas]], in the tenth grade,<ref name=\"Winters\"/> while Anderson shared Max's ambition and lack of academic motivation, and also had a crush on an older woman.<ref name=\"O'Sullivan\">{{cite news | last = O'Sullivan | first = Michael | title = The Heads of ''Rushmore'' | work = [[The Washington Post]] | pages = N41 | date = February 5, 1999 | url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/1999/02/05/the-heads-of-rushmore/46ca3771-4a7c-4827-ac44-92e685fc63c0/ }}</ref> Anderson and Wilson began writing the screenplay for ''Rushmore'' years before they made ''[[Bottle Rocket]]''.<ref name=\"Winters\"/> They knew that they wanted to make a film set in an elite preparatory school, much like St. Mark's, which Owen had attended along with his two brothers, Andrew and Luke (Luke being the sole graduate), and [[St. John's School (Texas)|St. John's School]] in [[Houston, Texas]] which Anderson had attended.

The montage sequence near the beginning of the film is strongly influenced by the rapid transitions used by [[French New Wave]] film-makers. The shot of Max in the go-cart also resembles a photograph by [[Jacques Henri Lartigue]]. Disney executives almost cancelled the montage sequence as they did not believe that these short singular shots were necessary due to the film's restrictive budget and time frame.

Devin Orgeron claims that Anderson's auteurship is interesting in his consistent \"cinematic and extracinematic confrontation with the very question of auteurship\". In Anderson's films, and especially ''Rushmore,'' the protagonist is a \"flawed but ultimately redeemable\" auteur. However, in both the protagonists' and Anderson's ties to their communities, an idea of \"''collective'' auteurship\" is proffered.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Orgeron|first=Devin|year=2007|title=La Camera-Crayola: Authorship Comes of Age in the Cinema of Wes Anderson|journal=Cinema Journal|volume=46| issue = 2|pages=40\u201365| jstor=4137181|doi=10.1353/cj.2007.0016}}</ref>\n\nMark Olsen writes that Anderson observes his characters chasing \"their miniaturist renditions of the American Dream\" and that \"they embody both sides of [[William Carlos Williams]]' famous edict that the pure products of America go crazy\".<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Olsen|first=Mark|year=1999|title=If I can dream: The everlasting boyhoods of Wes Anderson|url=https://search.proquest.com/openview/05f17879d09dacfcce7c2482f99c67ce/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&cbl=24820|journal=Film Comment|volume=35| issue = 1|page=12 |location=New York}}</ref>\n\nDeborah J. Thomas argues that ''Rushmore'' has a certain level of deliberate artifice. She observes a tension between irony and affect, and the clash \"between these aesthetic modes destabilises normative assumptions and expectations in relation to character engagement.\" For her Anderson uses a \"series of strategies in relation to framing, camera angles, shot scales, sound and performance that are designed to unsettle the audience's experience of proximity to, and hence intimacy with, the characters\".<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Framing the 'melancomic': character, aesthetics and affect in Wes Anderson's Rushmore|first=Deborah J. |last=Thomas | doi=10.1080/17400309.2011.633785|journal=New Review of Film and Television Studies \n|volume=10|year= 2012 |issue= 1|pages=97\u2013117 |s2cid=56468686 }}</ref>\n\nIn the film, Anderson frequently employs the visual device of a stage, or stage curtains, to present the action. Rachel Joseph speculates that there is a link between these \"screened stages\" and the theme of mourning, for this \"framed theatricality ... parallels the grieving process of reenacting and repeating the traumatic\". She also draws a connection between this style of presentation and the \"cinema of attractions\" that Tom Gunning theorised.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Films of Wes Anderson: Critical Essays on an Indiewood Icon|last=Joseph|first=Rachel|publisher=Springer|year=2014|isbn=978-1-137-40312-4|editor-last=Kunze|editor-first=Peter|chapter='\"Max Fischer Presents\": Wes Anderson and the Theatricality of Mourning'}}</ref>\n\n==Soundtrack==\n{{further|Rushmore (soundtrack)}}\nWes Anderson originally intended for the film's soundtrack to be entirely made up of songs by [[The Kinks]], feeling the music suited Max's loud and angry nature, and because Max was initially envisioned to be a British exchange student.
