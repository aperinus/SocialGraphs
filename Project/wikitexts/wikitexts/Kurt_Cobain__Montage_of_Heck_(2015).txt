The film was directed by [[Brett Morgen]] and premiered at the [[2015 Sundance Film Festival]]. It received a limited theatrical release worldwide and premiered on television in the United States on [[HBO]] on May 4, 2015. The documentary chronicles the life of Kurt Cobain from his birth in [[Aberdeen, Washington]] in 1967, through his troubled early family life and teenage years and rise to fame as frontman of Nirvana, up to [[Suicide of Kurt Cobain|his suicide in April 1994]] in [[Seattle]] at the [[27 Club|age of 27]].\n\nThe film includes artwork by Cobain as well as music and sound collages composed by him. Much of music and sound collages were released on the film's soundtrack, ''[[Montage of Heck: The Home Recordings]]''. A companion book was also released containing animation stills from the film as well as transcripts of interviews, photographs, and pieces of Cobain's artwork not featured in the film.\n\n== Plot ==\nAfter Kurt Cobain was born in 1967, his parents moved to Aberdeen, Washington, shortly after his sister Kim is born. Kurt lived a normal childhood, although his father Don would pick on him. At the age of nine, his parents had divorced. He lived with Don for a while until Don married Jenny Westeby and they have kids together. He moved back in with his mom and as a teenager, he became unruly and started smoking pot with friends. He and his friends started to visit the home of a developmentally challenged high school classmate to steal her father's alcohol. It became a hard time for Cobain, who considered suicide for the first time. After he attempted to have sex with the girl, his classmates began insulting and shaming him. Cobain, who was unable to take the ridicule, lies down on train tracks and had the intention of ending his life, but the train traveled on a different railway.\n\nAfter Kurt had become homeless and living with friends, he eventually gets his own place at 17 and started a band with [[Krist Novoselic]]. [[Chad Channing]] eventually joined the band on drums and they chose the band name \"Nirvana\". Nirvana's first \"shows\" consists of playing for a few friends and random passersby at local house parties. They eventually start playing at clubs and radio stations and Kurt starts dating Tracy Marander. The band signs onto [[Sub Pop]] record company and they release their first album, ''[[Bleach (Nirvana album)|Bleach]]''. The band starts to have interviews and doing tours. After a short while, Kurt breaks up with Tracy. Chad leaves the band, Nirvana leaves the label to sign onto [[DGC Records]] and [[Dave Grohl]] becomes the new drummer.\n\nAfter recording their next album, ''Nevermind'', their song \"[[Smells Like Teen Spirit]]\" becomes a hit and the band is launched into the mainstream. Kurt meets [[Courtney Love]] and they start dating. In 1992, they get married after they find out she is pregnant, but at the same time Kurt gets into heroin. In an interview with ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'', Courtney mentions Kurt's heroin habit and that Courtney tried it as well; Lynn Hirschberg, the journalist for the magazine, writes that Courtney used the drug while pregnant, misquoting her. Shortly after Frances is born, they are confronted by the Los Angeles County Department of Children's Services, who take the Cobains to court, claiming that the couple's drug usage makes them unfit parents. Due to the claims made in the ''Vanity Fair'' article, Seattle child welfare agents remove the couple's baby daughter for around four weeks. The couple eventually obtain custody in an exchange for agreeing to provide urine tests and receive regular visits from a social worker. After months of legal negotiations, the couple are eventually granted full custody of their daughter.\n\nKurt's heroin use continues as the band record their new album ''[[In Utero (album)|In Utero]]'' in 1993. [[Pat Smear]] joins the band and they start doing arena tours. Cobain starts to turn pale while suffering withdrawal. Not long after returning home, Cobain's heroin use resumes. The band goes on to do an [[MTV]] Unplugged performance and they continue touring again in early 1994. After being diagnosed with bronchitis and severe laryngitis, he flies to Rome the next day for medical treatment, and is joined there by Courtney, on March 3, 1994. The next morning, Love awakes to find that Cobain has overdosed on a combination of champagne and Rohypnol. Cobain is immediately rushed to the hospital and spends the rest of the day unconscious. After five days in the hospital, Cobain is released and returns to Seattle.\n\nThe screen cuts to black and a text appears stating: \"One month after returning from Rome, Kurt Cobain took his own life. He was 27 years old.\" The credits then begin.\n\n== Production ==\n[[File:Nirvana around 1992 (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright|Kurt Cobain performing with [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]] at the MTV Video Music Awards in 1992]]\n\nThe documentary is directed by [[Brett Morgen]], who began work in 2007 when Cobain's widow [[Courtney Love]] approached him with the idea.<ref name=\"Gallo\">{{Cite news

That was kind of the whole premise of my movie, was that Kurt was very mercurial. He was always spinning tales. So I thought, rather than make a movie based on his interviews, I'm going to make a movie based on his art.

He was also critical of the film, notably about the \"fat retard girl\" story featured in the film, which he denounced that story as being not true, stating \"Like that story he tells about the 'fat retard girl,' that's totally fake. We would have known that story. Even talking to friends of mine from Aberdeen who saw it, it's like 'I never heard about that.' I mean, you can tell he's reading it from a piece of paper. He probably wrote it, but it's not about him. The names of the guys he mentions in there, 'Oh, I used to hang out with Bill and Bob and Jeff,' it's like, who? Those people don't exist.\"<ref>[https://www.mixcloud.com/JackAntonio/dale-crover-the-melvins-chats-with-jack-antonio-june-82015/ Dale Crover (The Melvins) Chats with Jack Antonio June 8/2015|Mixcloud]</ref>\n\nIn 2016, [[Krist Novoselic]] responded to Buzz's criticism of the film, stating \"That's just Buzz, he's always been like that, but we love him so we just accept him for that.
