The [[screenplay]] by [[Arnold Schulman]] is based on the [[Libretto|book]] of the 1975 [[A Chorus Line|stage production of the same name]] by [[James Kirkwood Jr.]] and [[Nicholas Dante]]. It is the first film adaptation of the stage production. The songs were composed by [[Marvin Hamlisch]] and [[Edward Kleban]]. The plot centers on a group of dancers auditioning for a part in a new [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] musical.\n\nReleased theatrically on December 13, 1985, by [[Columbia Pictures]], the film received mixed reviews from critics, who compared it unfavorably with the musical, and was a [[box office bomb]], grossing only $14 million from a $25 million budget.\n\n== Plot ==\nIn a Broadway theater, from a darkened place in the audience, director Zach ([[Michael Douglas]]) judges dozens of dancers and their performances. After initial eliminations, sixteen hopefuls remain. Arriving late is former lead dancer Cassie ([[Alyson Reed]]) who once had a tempestuous romantic relationship with Zach but left him for Hollywood. Now she has not worked in over a year, and is desperate enough to be part of the [[chorus line]].\n\nZach is looking for eight dancers (four men and four women) and has them introduce themselves. As they each step forward, he interviews them and coaxes the dancers into talking about a variety of topics. This includes how they began dancing, first sexual experiences, their families, and hardships they've faced. Through their stories, the group reveals how being a performer is a difficult profession.\n\nAs Cassie enters the stage, Zach tells Larry to take all the dancers to a rehearsal room. Cassie pleads to continue the audition. Zach relents and sends her to learn the routine with everyone else. Paul re-enters the stage and tells Zach about how he was sexually molested as a child while watching musicals on [[42nd Street (Manhattan)|42nd Street]]. Paul describes his first job at a [[Cross-dressing|drag]] cabaret. When his parents found out that he was gay and performing in drag, they couldn't look him in the eye. Zach embraces Paul, showing compassion for the first time in the audition.\n\nLarry brings the dancers back onstage to perform the newly learned routine. Zach shouts at Cassie, as she cannot blend in. They argue about their past romantic relationship while Larry leads the group in a tap combination. Suddenly, Paul slips, falls and injures his knee. As he is rushed to the hospital, Zach asks the dancers what they will do once they can no longer perform. Diana is the only one that can truly answer the question, telling him that she wants to be remembered, even just for dancing in a chorus, which all the hopefuls seem to agree with. Zach chooses Val, Cassie, Bebe, Diana, Mike, Mark, Richie, and Bobby to be in his line.\n\nMonths later, the eight performers are seen performing \"One\" in front of an audience. As the song progresses, the cut dancers also appear onstage and it becomes harder to identify each dancer. The dancer's reflections from the mirror joins them and soon the stage is filled with hundreds of dancers. As the credits roll, the song's tag vamps as the dancers continue dancing in a giant [[kickline]].\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Michael Douglas]] as Zach, choreographer\n* [[Alyson Reed]] as Cassie\n* [[Terrence Mann]] as Larry, assistant choreographer\n* [[Sharon Brown (actress)|Sharon Brown]] as Kim, Zach's secretary\n\n;Dancers\n{{Cast list|\n* Michael Blevins as Mark Tobori\n* Yamil Borges as Diana Morales\n* [[Jan Gan Boyd]] as Connie Wong\n* [[Gregg Burge]] as Richie Walters\n* Cameron English as Paul San Marco\n* [[Tony Fields]] as Al DeLuca\n* [[Audrey Landers]] as Val Clarke\n* [[Nicole Fosse]] as Kristine Evelyn Erlich-DeLuca\n* [[Vicki Frederick]] as Sheila Bryant\n* Michelle Johnston as Beatrice Ann \"Bebe\" Benson\n* [[Janet Jones]] as Judy Monroe\n* Pam Klinger as Maggie Winslow\n* Charles McGowan as Mike Cass\n* Justin Ross as Greg Gardner\n* Blane Savage as Don Kerr\n* [[Matt West]] as Bobby Mills\n}}\n\n== Musical numbers ==\n# \"[[I Hope I Get It]]\" \u2013 Entire cast\u2014Contains new sections of music not in the original stage version\n# \"Who Am I Anyway?\" \u2013 Paul\u2014his solo, originally part of \"I Hope I Get It\"\n# \"[[I Can Do That (A Chorus Line song)|I Can Do That]]\" \u2013 Mike\n# \"[[At the Ballet]]\" \u2013 Sheila, Bebe and Maggie\u2014the soundtrack contains an extended version not heard in the film\n# \"Surprise, Surprise\" \u2013 Richie and dancers\u2014replaces \"[[Hello Twelve, Hello Thirteen, Hello Love]]\" and \"Gimme the Ball\", although one verse of the song is heard in the film.

Bennett declined to participate when his proposal to present the film as an audition to cast the movie version of the stage play, instead of a literal translation of the play (cf. the 1971 film adaptation of ''[[The Boy Friend (musical)|The Boy Friend]]'') was rejected. Many directors turned down the project, insisting that not only was ''A Chorus Line'' too beloved, but it would not translate well to the screen. In addition, the requirement to start paying royalties after the gross reached $30 million\u2014by which time the film might not yet have broken even\u2014made the film a difficult financial prospect.<ref name=\"freedman\"/> When Attenborough accepted the project in 1984,<ref name=\"AFI\">{{cite web|url=https://catalog.afi.com/Catalog/moviedetails/57367|title=A Chorus Line|work=[[AFI Catalog]]|access-date=April 2, 2018}}</ref> there was some apprehension as to the treatment the British director would give the musical's quintessentially American story.\n\nUniversal sold the rights to [[PolyGram]] for $7.8 million in 1982 and in 1983 [[Embassy Pictures]] joined as co-producers,<ref name=\"AFI\" /> investing 20% in Embassy Film Associates, which financed the picture.<ref name=DDL />\n\nIn February 1984, according to Attenborough, the singer [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] auditioned at the [[Royale Theatre]] on [[Broadway (Manhattan)|Broadway]] for a dance role in the movie using her birth name of Ciccone. He rejected her.<ref>''Entirely Up To You, Darling'' by Diana Hawkins & Richard Attenborough; page 133; paperback; Arrow Books; published 2009. {{ISBN|978-0-099-50304-0}}</ref>\n\nThe dance numbers were choreographed by [[Jeffrey Hornaday]].\n\nMatt West, Vicki Frederick, Pam Klinger, Justin Ross, and Alyson Reed had all appeared in ''A Chorus Line'' on Broadway or in other major productions of the stage show prior to appearing in the film version. Gregg Burge, Charles McGowan, and Blane Savage joined stage productions of ''A Chorus Line'' after filming the movie.\n\n[[Audrey Landers]] could move well but was not a trained dancer as was the rest of the cast. Attenborough cast her in the film despite her lack of formal dance training. She is absent from some of the more difficult choreographed dance numbers.\n\nThe decision to tamper with the score disappointed fans of the show. \"Hello Twelve, Hello Thirteen, Hello Love,\" \"Sing!,\" and \"The Music and the Mirror\" were deleted (the first was touched on briefly) and new songs \"Surprise, Surprise\" and \"Let Me Dance For You\" were added. The show's breakout tune, \"What I Did for Love,\" was originally performed by Diana as a [[paean]] to dancers and their dedication to their craft, but in the film it becomes a wistful love song by Cassie about Zach as she leaves the stage. Another change from the stage show to the movie sees the character of Bebe being selected as one of the final eight dancers, rather than Judy.\n\nThe stage musical was one of the first productions to address the subject of gay actors within the theatre. However, the film version opted instead to make a more \"family friendly\" film by dealing less with the experiences of gay actors.\n\nSix months prior to release, Embassy Pictures was sold to [[The Coca-Cola Company]], who also owned [[Columbia Pictures]]. Five months later, [[Dino DeLaurentiis]] acquired Embassy but he did not acquire the 20% interest in Embassy Film Associates, which created some confusion over who would handle the film, which was already scheduled to be distributed by Columbia.<ref name=DDL>{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=November 13, 1985|page=3|title=Dino Cleans House At Embassy; 70 Staffers Are Canned On Coast|last=Greenberg|first=James}}</ref>\n\n== Reception ==\n=== Critical response ===\nIn his review in ''[[The New York Times]]'', [[Vincent Canby]] observed, \"Though it was generally agreed that ''[[Hair (film)|Hair]]'' would not work as a film, [[Milo\u0161 Forman]] transformed it into one of the most original pieces of musical cinema of the last 20 years.
