The film first appeared on January 20, 2008 at the [[2008 Sundance Film Festival]]. It was later shown at the [[Berlin International Film Festival]]. The film opened on February 22, 2008 in the United Kingdom and in North America.\n\nThe title is inspired by a phrase that was commonly displayed on video rental cassettes in America during the medium's heyday.<ref>[http://www.thedeadbolt.com/news/104016/jackblack_interview.php/ Deadbolt Interview with Jack Black] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.today/20110720073818/http://www.thedeadbolt.com/news/104016/jackblack_interview.php/ |date=July 20, 2011 }}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nIn 2003, [[Passaic, New Jersey]], the declining \"Be Kind Rewind\" VHS rental store owned by Mr. Elroy Fletcher is due to be demolished to make way for high-end development unless he can find the money to renovate his building, despite his claims that jazz pianist [[Fats Waller]] was born in that building. His building is condemned as a [[slum]] and the officials give him 60 days to upgrade the building to the required standards or they will demolish it.\n\nMr. Fletcher leaves on a trip for several days joining some friends to memorialize Waller, as well as visiting rental store chains to research efficient and modernized ways of running a video rental store, leaving his only employee, Mike, to tend to the store. Before leaving Mr. Fletcher cautions Mike to keep his [[paranoia|paranoid]] and klutzy conspiracy theorist friend, Jerry, away from the store. However, Mike reads it in reverse on the steamed up train window, and does not understand.\n\nAfter attempting to sabotage a nearby electrical substation, believing its energy to be melting his brain, Jerry receives an electrical shock which leaves him magnetized, and when he enters the store the next day, he inadvertently erases all the VHS tapes in the store (as well as making the TV not work correctly, whenever he walks past it). Mike quickly discovers the disaster, and is further pressed when Miss Falewicz, an acquaintance of Mr. Fletcher, wants to rent ''[[Ghostbusters]]''. To prevent her from reporting a problem to Mr. Fletcher, Mike comes up with an idea: as Miss Falewicz has never seen the movie, he proposes to recreate the film using himself and Jerry as the actors and cheap special effects hoping to fool her. They complete the movie just in time when another customer asks for ''[[Rush Hour 2]]''. Mike and Jerry repeat their filming, enlisting the help of Alma, a local woman, for some of the parts. Alma later makes Jerry a remedy that demagnetizes him.\n\nWord of mouth spreads through Miss Falewicz's nephew of the inadvertently hilarious results of Mike and Jerry's filming, and soon the store is seeing more requests for such movies. Mike, Jerry, and Alma quickly pass off the movies as being \"sweded\", insisting the films came from Sweden and thus able to demand long wait times and higher costs for the rental ($20 instead of $1). Soon, to meet demand, Mike and Jerry enlist the locals to help out in making the movies, using them as starring roles in their films. When Mr. Fletcher returns, intent on converting the store to a [[DVD]] rental outlet, he quickly recognizes that they are making more money from the sweded films than from normal rentals, and joins in with the process. However, the success is put to a halt when two court [[bailiff]]s arrive, insisting the sweded films are [[copyright infringement|copyright violations]], and seize the tapes and the store's assets, crushing the tapes with a [[steamroller]]. Without any money to renovate the building, Mr. Fletcher gives up hope, and is forced to reveal to Mike that he made up the connection of Fats Waller to their building. Mr. Fletcher is given a week to evacuate the building before it will be razed.\n\nJerry, with the help of the local townspeople, convinces Mr. Fletcher and Mike to give one last hurrah and put together an original documentary dedicated to the fake life of Fats Waller, and the two quickly warm up to the idea. They create ''Fats Waller Was Born Here''.\n\nOn the day the building is scheduled for demolition, Mr. Fletcher invites all the locals to watch the final film, but quietly reveals to Miss Falewicz that he gave the city official permission to go ahead with the demolition plans after the film has ended. Jerry accidentally breaks the store's TV screen trying to raise it for all to see, but a nearby DVD store owner loans them his [[video projector]], allowing them to show the movie on a white cloth placed in the store's window. As their film ends, Mr. Fletcher, Mike and Jerry exit the store to find a larger crowd has gathered in the street to watch the film through the window, including the city official and wrecking crew, and they are given a rousing applause by the gathered crowd.\n\nThe credits roll with more of the mockumentary and Fats Waller singing \"[[Your Feet's Too Big]]\".\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Melonie Diaz.jpg|thumb|upright|Melonie Diaz introducing the film at the [[Karlovy Vary International Film Festival]] in 2008]]\n* [[Mos Def]] as Mike Coolwell \n* [[Jack Black]] as Jerry McLean\n* [[Danny Glover]] as Elroy Fletcher\n* [[Mia Farrow]] as Miss Falewicz\n* [[Melonie Diaz]] as Alma Sykes\n* [[Arjay Smith]] as Manny\n* [[Quinton Aaron]] as Q\n* Chandler Parker as Craig\n* [[Karolina Wydra]] as Gabrielle Bochenski\n* [[P.

These remakes are unedited with only a single take per scene. The tapes are described as having come from Sweden as an excuse for higher rental fees and longer wait times. Jerry fabricates the word \"sweded\" while arguing with Craig (Chandler Parker) and his gang.\n\nIn light of the theme of sweding, director Michel Gondry sweded a version of the trailer of the film, starring himself. On the official website, users can engage in sweding, which puts their faces on the VHS cover of a movie.<ref>Matheson, Whitney. ''[[USA Today]]''. ''Web watch.'' Life section, page 3D.
