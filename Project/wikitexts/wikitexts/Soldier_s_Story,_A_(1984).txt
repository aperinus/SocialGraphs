It is a story about racism in a [[racial segregation|segregated]] regiment of the [[United States Army|U.S Army]] commanded by White officers and training in the [[Jim Crow laws|Jim Crow South]], in a time and place where a Black officer is unprecedented and bitterly resented by nearly everyone, and follows a Black [[Judge Advocate General's Corps|JAG]] officer sent to investigate the murder of a Black sergeant in [[Louisiana]] near the end of [[World War II]].\n\nThe cast, composed primarily of Black actors, is led by [[Howard E. Rollins Jr.]] and [[Adolph Caesar]] (whose performance was nominated for a Best Supporting Actor Oscar). Other actors include [[Art Evans (actor)|Art Evans]], [[David Alan Grier]], [[Larry Riley (actor)|Larry Riley]], [[David Harris (American actor)|David Harris]], [[Robert Townsend (actor)|Robert Townsend]], and [[Patti LaBelle]]. [[Denzel Washington]], still at the beginning of his career, appears in a supporting role. Several actors reprise their roles from the stage version.\n\nThe film was first shown at the [[Toronto International Film Festival]]. It won the New York Drama Critics Award, the [[Outer Critics Circle Award]], the Theater Club Award, and three ''[[Village Voice]]'' [[Obie Award]]s. It won the Golden Prize at the [[14th Moscow International Film Festival]].<ref name=\"Moscow1985\">{{cite web|url=http://www.moscowfilmfestival.ru/miff34/eng/archives/?year=1985 |title=14th Moscow International Film Festival (1985) |accessdate=2013-02-08 |work=MIFF |url-status = dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130316084353/http://moscowfilmfestival.ru/miff34/eng/archives/?year=1985 |archivedate=2013-03-16 }}</ref> It was also nominated for three [[Academy Awards]]: for Best Picture, Supporting Actor ([[Adolph Caesar]]), and Screenplay Adaptation (Fuller).\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1944 during [[World War II]], Vernon Waters, a [[master sergeant]] in a company of Black soldiers, is shot to death with a [[.45 caliber pistol]] outside Fort Neal, a segregated [[United States Army|Army]] base in [[Louisiana]].  Captain Richard Davenport, a Black officer from the [[Judge Advocate General's Corps]], is sent to investigate, against the wishes of commanding officer Colonel Nivens. Most assume Waters was killed by the local [[Ku Klux Klan]], but others are doubtful.\n\nNivens gives Davenport three days to conduct his investigation. Even Captain Taylor, the only White officer in favor of a full investigation, is uncooperative and patronizing, fearing a Black officer will have little success. While some Black soldiers are proud to see one of their own wearing captain's bars, others are distrustful and evasive.\n\nDavenport learns that Waters' company was officially part of the 221st Chemical Smoke Generator Battalion.  Though eager to serve their country, they are assigned menial jobs in deference to their white counterparts. Most are former players from the [[Negro baseball league]], grouped as a unit to play ball with Waters as manager. Their success against white soldiers gives them a good deal of popularity, with talk of an exhibition game against the [[New York Yankees]].\n\nJames Wilkie, a fellow sergeant Waters demoted for being drunk on duty, initially describes Waters as a strict disciplinarian, but also a fair, good-natured NCO who got on well with the men, especially the jovial and well-liked C.J. Memphis. Davenport uncovers Waters' true tyrannical nature and his disgust with fellow Black soldiers, particularly those from the rural South.\n\nPrivate Peterson reveals he stood up to Waters when he berated the men after a winning game. Waters challenged Peterson to a fight and beat him badly. Interviewing other soldiers, Davenport learns that Waters charged C.J. with the murder of a white MP, after a search conducted by Wilkie turned up a recently discharged pistol under C.J.'s bunk. Waters provoked C.J. into striking him, whereupon the weapons charge was dismissed and C.J. was charged with striking a superior officer.\n\nWhen C.J.'s best friend Corporal Cobb visits him in jail, C.J. is suffering from intense [[claustrophobia]] and tells Cobb of a visit from Waters, who admitted it was a set-up Waters had done to others. Davenport learns from Cobb that C.J., awaiting trial, hanged himself. In protest, the platoon deliberately lost the season's last game, and Waters was shaken by the suicide. Taylor disbanded the team, and the players were assigned to the 221st.\n\nDavenport learns that white officers Captain Wilcox and Lieutenant Byrd had an altercation with Waters shortly before his death. Both officers admit to assaulting Waters when he confronted them in a drunken tirade, but deny killing him as they had not been issued .45 ammunition. Though Taylor is convinced Wilcox and Byrd are lying, Davenport releases them.\n\nPrivates Peterson and Smalls go [[AWOL]], and Davenport forces Wilkie to admit he planted the gun under C.J.'s bunk on Waters' orders. Waters had divulged his [[internalized racism]] to Wilkie, revealing that during World War I, he helped lynch a Black soldier who acted as an [[Uncle Tom syndrome|Uncle Tom]] to French civilians. Davenport asks why Waters did not target Peterson because of their fight, and Wilkie explains that Waters liked and respected Peterson, because Peterson stood up for himself. Davenport has Wilkie arrested just as an impromptu celebration begins, as the platoon is to be shipped out to join the fight overseas.\n\nRealizing Peterson and Smalls were on guard duty the night of Waters' murder, and thus had been issued .45 ammunition for their pistols, Davenport interrogates Smalls, found by the MPs. Smalls confesses Peterson killed Sergeant Waters, as revenge for C.J.'s death. Captured and brought to the interrogation room, Peterson confesses to the murder, saying \"I didn't kill much. Some things need getting rid of\u201d, to which Davenport retorts \u201cWho gave the right to judge who is fit to be a Negro?\u201d\n\nTaylor congratulates Davenport, admitting that he will have to get used to Negroes being in charge. Davenport assures Taylor that he will get used to it \u2013 \"You can bet your ass on that,\" he adds, as the platoon marches in preparation for their deployment to the [[European theatre of World War II|European theatre]].\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Howard Rollins|Howard E.

[[Warner Bros.]] turned it down, as did [[Universal Studios|Universal]] and [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]. Columbia's [[Frank Price]] read the screenplay and was deeply interested, but the studio was hesitant about its commercial value, so Jewison offered to do the film for a $5 million budget and no salary. When the [[Directors Guild of America]] insisted he must have a fee, he agreed to take the lowest possible amount. The film ended up grossing $22.1 million.<ref name=\"boxoffice\">{{cite web|url=https://www.the-numbers.com/movies/1984/0SLST.php |title=A Soldier's Story - Box Office Data, DVD Sales, Movie News, Cast Information |publisher=The Numbers |date= |accessdate=June 19, 2013}}</ref>\n\n[[Howard E.
