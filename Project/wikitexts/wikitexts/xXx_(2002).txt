Moritz]] and written by [[Rich Wilkes]]. The first installment in the [[XXX (film series)|''XXX'' film series]], the film stars [[Vin Diesel]] as Xander Cage, a thrill-seeking [[extreme sport]]s enthusiast, [[Stunt performer|stuntman]] and rebellious athlete-turned reluctant spy for the [[National Security Agency]]. Cage is sent on a dangerous mission to infiltrate a group of potential Russian terrorists in Central Europe. The film also stars [[Asia Argento]], [[Marton Csokas]] and [[Samuel L. Jackson]]. Cohen, Moritz and Diesel had previously worked on ''[[The Fast and the Furious (2001 film)|The Fast and the Furious]]'' (2001) as director, producer and cast member respectively.\n\nThe film grossed $277.4 million worldwide<ref name=\"boxoffice\" /> and was followed by two sequels, ''[[XXX: State of the Union]]'' and ''[[XXX: Return of Xander Cage]]'', released in 2005 and 2017, respectively.\n\n==Plot==\n<!--per [[WP:FILMPLOT]], plot summaries should be between 400 and 700 words--> \nAnarchy 99, a Russian terrorist group, acquires a biochemical weapon, \"Silent Night\", presumed missing since [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|the fall of the Soviet Union]]. Anarchy 99 easily discover and kill an undercover agent sent by the American [[National Security Agency]] to recover it. NSA Agent Augustus Gibbons suggests sending someone who lacks ties to the US government, such as Xander \"XXX\" Cage, an extreme sports professional wanted by the FBI for acts protesting against a senator. Gibbons takes Cage into custody, who then passes two field tests, before reluctantly accepting the job after he is told the only other option is prison.\n\nCage meets the NSA support team in [[Prague]], which includes Czech agent Milan Sova, who has been tasked with supervising and, if necessary, deporting Cage. While scouting an Anarchy 99 party, Cage identifies Sova as a police officer to Anarchy 99's leader, Yorgi, earning him favor with the group. Cage asks Yorgi about purchasing high end sports cars, and Yelena, Yorgi's girlfriend and lieutenant, gives Cage an account number.\n\nGibbons calls Cage about changes to the plan but is impressed when Cage gives them information provided by the star-struck Kolya. As a result, Gibbons sends tech-specialist Agent Toby Shavers, who provides Cage with a special revolver, binoculars that can see through walls and explosives disguised as bandages. As Cage attends the car deal he made with Yorgi, Sova attempts to intercede. Using the trick revolver and special effects, Cage fakes killing Sova. Having earned Yorgi's trust, Cage joins Anarchy 99.\n\nYorgi brings Cage back to a castle after a dance party at one of his nightclubs that serves as Anarchy 99's headquarters. Cage, while searching for the biochemical weapon, catches Yelena investigating Yorgi's secret safe. He takes her to a nearby restaurant to discuss the matter and reveals his true identity. Sova betrays Cage to Yorgi on the phone. Furious, Yorgi sends his trusted sniper Kirill to kill Cage. While watching the pair, Kirill, who is in love with Yelena, warns her. As Cage and Yelena stage a fight, the NSA suddenly appears to capture Cage, and Yelena is taken back to Anarchy 99.\n\nCage meets with Gibbons, who demands that Cage return to America now that his cover is blown and special forces are planning to siege the castle. Cage refuses, fearing for Yelena's life and bitter that Sova purposely blew his cover. Cage sneaks into Yorgi's castle and follows him into a secret underground lab. Cage overhears Yorgi's plan to launch \"Silent Night\" from a water-borne drone named Ahab. Cage flees the area after killing Kolya. At his hideout, he finds Sova waiting for him, now with Yorgi. Before Sova can kill Cage, Yelena saves him and reveals herself to be an undercover Russian [[Federal Security Service]] agent abandoned by her handlers. Cage relays Yorgi's plans to the NSA in return for Yelena's asylum. Against orders, Cage gives his car to Shavers and tells him to load it up with weaponry. Cage parachutes from a plane on a snowboard near Anarchy 99's communication tower. He starts an avalanche that destroys the tower but is captured by Yorgi, who already knew Yelena's identity. As Yorgi prepares to kill them, the special forces attack. Cage and Yelena free their restraints, but Yorgi launches Ahab before Cage kills him.\n\nThe Czech military prepares to destroy Ahab with airstrikes, though this will release some of the biochemical agent. Cage and Yelena take his car, now heavily modified by Agent Shavers, to race alongside the river to catch up to Ahab. Cage harpoons the drone, crosses over to it, and disables the weapon moments before it goes off. Cage and Yelena are recovered, and Gibbons follows through on his promises. In the conclusion, Cage and Yelena are relaxing in [[Bora Bora]] when Gibbons contacts Cage to offer him another mission, but Cage ignores him.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Vin Diesel]] as Agent Xander \"Triple X\" Cage, a [[thrill seeking]] [[United States|American]] [[extreme sports]] enthusiast, [[stuntman]] and [[anti-establishment]] activist. Idolized in some sub-cultures, xXx is also hunted by the authorities and he is offered a deal to become a [[spy]] for the [[National Security Agency]] in exchange for leniency, the agency requiring an agent who can do the current job without the military professional training that Anarchy 99's background will allow them to recognise.\n* [[Samuel L.
