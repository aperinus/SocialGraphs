The film, distributed by [[United Artists]], stars [[Robert De Niro]] as Jake LaMotta, an Italian-American [[middleweight]] boxer whose self-destructive and obsessive rage, jealousy and animalistic appetite destroyed his relationship with his wife and family. Also featured in the film are [[Joe Pesci]] as [[Joey LaMotta|Joey]], LaMotta's brother, and [[Cathy Moriarty]] as [[Vikki LaMotta|Vikki]], his wife. [[Nicholas Colasanto]], [[Theresa Saldana]] and [[Frank Vincent]] play supporting roles in the film.\n\nScorsese was initially reluctant to develop the project, though he eventually came to relate to LaMotta's story. Schrader re-wrote Martin's first screenplay, and Scorsese and De Niro together made uncredited contributions thereafter. Pesci was an unknown actor prior to the film, as was Moriarty, who was suggested for her role by Pesci. During [[principal photography]], each of the boxing scenes was choreographed for a specific visual style and De Niro gained approximately {{convert|60|lb|kg}} to portray LaMotta in his later post-boxing years. Scorsese was exacting in the process of [[Post-production|editing and mixing]] the film, expecting it to be his last major feature.\n\n''Raging Bull'' premiered in New York on November 14, 1980 and was released in theaters on December 19, 1980. The film had a lukewarm box office of $23.4&nbsp;million against its $18&nbsp;million budget. The film received mixed reviews upon its release; while De Niro's performance and the editing were widely acclaimed, it garnered criticism due to its violent content. Despite the mixed reviews, the film was nominated for eight [[Academy Awards]] at the [[53rd Academy Awards]] (tying with ''[[The Elephant Man (film)|The Elephant Man]]'' as the most nominated film of the ceremony), including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]] and [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]], and won two: [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] for De Niro (his second Oscar) and [[Academy Award for Best Film Editing|Best Editing]].\n\nAfter its release, ''Raging Bull'' went on to garner high critical praise, and is now considered one of the [[List of films considered the best|greatest films ever made]]. In 1990, it became the first film to be selected in its first year of eligibility for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]], as being \"culturally, historically or aesthetically significant\",<ref>{{Cite web|title=Complete National Film Registry Listing |url=https://www.loc.gov/programs/national-film-preservation-board/film-registry/complete-national-film-registry-listing/|website=Library of Congress|access-date=2020-05-08|archive-date=October 31, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161031213743/https://www.loc.gov/programs/national-film-preservation-board/film-registry/complete-national-film-registry-listing/|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|last1=Gamarekian|first1=Barbara|last2=Times|first2=Special To the New York|date=1990-10-19|title=Library of Congress Adds 25 Titles to National Film Registry|work=[[The New York Times]]|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/10/19/movies/library-of-congress-adds-25-titles-to-national-film-registry.html|access-date=2020-05-08|issn=0362-4331|archive-date=October 4, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201004011545/https://www.nytimes.com/1990/10/19/movies/library-of-congress-adds-25-titles-to-national-film-registry.html/|url-status=live}}</ref> and the [[American Film Institute]] ranked it as the [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Movies (10th Anniversary Edition)|fourth-greatest American movie of all time]].\n\n== Plot ==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for featured film articles should be 400-700 words. -->\nIn 1964, an aging, overweight [[Italian American]], [[Jake LaMotta]], practices a comedy routine.\n\nIn 1941, LaMotta is in a major boxing match against [[Jimmy Reeves]], where he suffered his first loss. Jake's brother, [[Joey LaMotta]], discusses a potential shot for the middleweight title with one of his [[Italian-American Mafia|Mafia]] connections, Salvy Batts, but Jake repeatedly refuses the mafia's help. Some time thereafter, Jake spots a fifteen-year-old girl named Vickie at an open-air swimming pool in his [[Bronx]] neighborhood. He eventually pursues a relationship with her, even though he is already married. In 1943, Jake defeats [[Sugar Ray Robinson]], and has a rematch three weeks later. Despite the fact that Jake dominates Robinson during the bout, the judges surprisingly rule in favor of Robinson and Joey feels Robinson won only because he was enlisting into the [[United States Army|Army]] the following week. By 1945, Jake marries Vickie.\n\nJake constantly worries about Vickie having feelings for other men, particularly when she makes an off-hand comment about [[Tony Janiro]], Jake's opponent in his next fight. His jealousy is evident when he brutally defeats Janiro in front of the local [[Mob boss]], Tommy Como, and Vickie. As Joey discusses the victory with journalists at the [[Copacabana (nightclub)|Copacabana]], he is distracted by seeing Vickie approach a table with Salvy and his crew. Joey speaks with Vickie, who says she is giving up on his brother. Blaming Salvy, Joey viciously attacks him in a fight that spills outside of the club. Como later orders them to apologize, and has Joey tell Jake that if he wants a chance at the championship title, which Como controls, he will have to take a dive first. In a match against [[Billy Fox (boxer)|Billy Fox]], after briefly pummeling his opponent, Jake does not even bother to put up a fight. He is suspended shortly thereafter from the board on suspicion of throwing the fight, though he realizes the error of his judgment when it is too late. He is eventually reinstated, and in 1949, wins the middleweight championship title against [[Marcel Cerdan]].\n\nA year later, Jake asks Joey if he fought with Salvy at the Copacabana because of Vickie. Jake then asks if Joey had an affair with her; Joey refuses to answer, insults Jake, and leaves. Jake directly asks Vickie about the affair, and when she hides from him in the bathroom, he breaks down the door, pushing her to sarcastically state that she had sex with the entire neighborhood (including Joey, Salvy and Tommy) out of exhaustion, exclaiming \"What do you want me to say!?\". Jake angrily walks to Joey's house, with Vickie following him, and assaults Joey in front of Joey's wife Lenora and their children before knocking Vickie unconscious. After defending his championship belt in a grueling fifteen-round bout against [[Laurent Dauthuille]] in 1950, he makes a call to his brother after the fight, but when Joey assumes Salvy is on the other end and starts insulting and cursing at him, Jake says nothing and hangs up. Estranged from Joey, Jake's career begins to decline slowly and he eventually loses his title to Sugar Ray Robinson in their final encounter in 1951.\n\nBy 1956, Jake and his family have moved to [[Miami]]. After he stays out all night at his new nightclub there, Vickie tells him she wants a divorce (which she has been planning since his retirement) as well as full custody of their kids. She also threatens to call the police if he comes anywhere near them. He is later arrested for introducing under-age girls to men in his club. He tries and fails to bribe his way out of his criminal case using the jewels from his championship belt instead of selling the belt itself. In 1957, he goes to jail, sorrowfully questioning his misfortune and crying in despair. Upon returning to [[New York City]] in 1958, he happens upon Joey, who forgives him but is elusive.\n\nAgain in 1964, Jake now recites the \"I coulda been a contender\" scene from the 1954 film ''[[On the Waterfront]]'', where Terry Malloy complains that his brother should have been there for him but is also keen enough to give himself some slack. After a stagehand informs him that the auditorium where he is about to perform is crowded, Jake starts to chant \"I'm the boss\" while [[shadowboxing]].\n\n== Cast ==\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Robert De Niro]] as [[Jake LaMotta]]<ref name=\"Evans p177\">Evans, Mike ''The Making of Raging Bull'' 2006 p.177.</ref>\n* [[Joe Pesci]] as [[Joey LaMotta]]<ref name=\"Evans p177\" />\n* [[Cathy Moriarty]] as [[Vikki LaMotta|Vickie LaMotta]]<ref name=\"Evans p177\" />\n* [[Nicholas Colasanto]] as Tommy Como<ref name=\"Evans p177\" />\n* [[Theresa Saldana]] as Lenora LaMotta, Joey's second wife<ref name=\"Evans p177\" />\n* [[Frank Vincent]] as Salvatore \"Salvy Batts\"<ref name=\"Evans p177\" />\n* Lori Anne Flax as Irma LaMotta, Jake's first wife\n* [[Mario Gallo (actor)|Mario Gallo]] as Mario\n* [[Frank Adonis]] as Patsy\n* Joseph Bono as Guido\n* Frank Topham as \"Toppy\"\n* [[Charles Scorsese]] as Charlie\n* [[Geraldine Smith (actress)|Geraldine Smith]] as Janet\n* [[Candy Moore]] as Linda\n* James V.

Although disappointed by the book's writing style, he became fascinated by the character of [[Jake LaMotta]]. He showed the book to Martin Scorsese on the set of ''[[Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore]]'' in the hope that he would consider the project.<ref name=\"Biskind p254\">Biskind, Peter, ''Easy Riders, Raging Bulls'', 1999, p. 254.</ref> Scorsese repeatedly turned down the opportunity to direct the film, claiming he had no idea what ''Raging Bull'' was about, even though he had read some of the text. Never a sports fan, when he found out what LaMotta used to do for a living, he said, \"A boxer? I don't like boxing...Even as a kid, I always thought that boxing was boring... It was something I couldn't, wouldn't grasp.\" His overall opinion of sport in general is, \"Anything with a ball, no good.\"<ref name=\"Biskind p378\">Biskind, Peter ''Easy Riders, Raging Bulls'' 1998, p. 378.</ref> The book was then passed onto Mardik Martin, the film's eventual co-screenwriter, who said \"the trouble is the damn thing has been done a hundred times before\u2014a fighter who has trouble with his brother and his wife and the mob is after him\". The book was even shown to producers Robert Chartoff and Irwin Winkler by De Niro, who were willing to assist only if Scorsese agreed.<ref name=\"Biskind p315\">Biskind, Peter, ''Easy Riders, Raging Bulls'', 1998, p. 315.</ref> After nearly dying from a [[drug overdose]], Scorsese agreed to make the film, not only to save his own life but also to save his career. Scorsese began to relate very personally to the story of Jake LaMotta, and in it he saw how the boxing ring can be \"an allegory for whatever you do in life\", which for him paralleled moviemaking, \"you make movies, you're in the ring each time.\"<ref name=\"Thompson pp.76/77\">Thompson, David and Christie, Ian, ''Scorsese on Scorsese'', pp.&nbsp;76/77.</ref><ref name=\"Friedman p115\">Friedman Lawrence S.

One night when the footage was being shown to De Niro, [[Michael Chapman (cinematographer)|Michael Chapman]], and his friend and mentor, the British director [[Michael Powell]], Powell pointed out that the color of the gloves at the time would have only been maroon, oxblood, or even black. Scorsese decided to use this as one of the reasons to film ''Raging Bull'' in black and white. Other reasons would be to distinguish the film from other color films around the time and to acknowledge the problem of fading color film stock\u2014an issue Scorsese recognized.<ref name=\"Biskind p389\">Biskind, Peter, ''Easy Riders, Raging Bulls'', 1998, p. 389.</ref><ref name=\"Total Film pp180-181\">Total Film, ''The 100 greatest films of all time'', pp. 180\u2013181.</ref><ref name=\"Thompson p80\">Thompson, David and Christie, Ian, ''Scorsese on Scorsese'', p. 80.</ref> Scorsese went to two matches at [[Madison Square Garden]] to aid his research, picking up on minor but essential details such as the blood sponge and later, the blood on the ropes (which would later be used in the film).<ref name=\"Thompson p80\" /> According to the brief comments on the inlay card of the Raging Bull DVD, Scorsese was not\u2014and still is not\u2014a fan of sports or boxing, which he describes as boring. When he saw the blood-soaked sponges being dipped in a bucket, he recalls thinking to himself, 'And they call this sport.'\n\n=== Screenplay ===\nUnder the guidance of Chartoff and Winkler, [[Mardik Martin]] was asked to start writing the screenplay.<ref name=\"Biskind p379\">Biskind, Peter ''Easy Riders, Raging Bulls'' 1998, p. 379.</ref> According to De Niro, under no circumstances would [[United Artists]] accept Martin's script.<ref name=\"Biskind pp384-385\">Biskind, Peter ''Easy Riders, Raging Bulls'' pp. 384\u2013385</ref> The story was based on the vision of journalist [[Pete Hamill]] of a 1930s and 1940s style, when boxing was known as \"the great dark prince of sports\". De Niro was unimpressed when he finished reading the first draft, however.<ref name=\"Baxter pp186-189\">Baxter John ''De Niro A Biography'', pp. 186\u2013189.</ref> ''[[Taxi Driver]]'' screenwriter [[Paul Schrader]] was swiftly brought in to rewrite the script around August 1978.<ref name=\"Baxter pp186-189\" /> Some of the changes that Schrader made to the script included a rewrite of the scene with the uncooked steak and inclusion of LaMotta seen masturbating in a [[Florida]] cell. The character of LaMotta's brother, Joey, was finally added, previously absent from Martin's script.<ref name=\"Biskind pp384-385\" /><ref name=\"Baxter pp186-189\" /> United Artists saw a massive improvement on the quality of the script. However, its chief executives, [[Steven Bach]] and David Field, met with Scorsese, De Niro, and producer [[Irwin Winkler]] in November 1978 to say they were worried that the content would be [[X-rated]] material and have no chance of finding an audience.<ref name=\"Biskind p389\" />\n\nAccording to Scorsese, the script was left to him and De Niro, and they spent two-and-a-half weeks on the island of [[Saint Martin (island)|Saint Martin]] extensively re-building the content of the film.<ref name=\"Thompson pp.76/77\" /> The most significant change would be the entire scene when LaMotta fixes his television and then accuses his wife of having an affair. Other changes included the removal of Jake and Joey's father; the reduction of [[organized crime]]'s role in the story and a major re-write of LaMotta's fight with Tony Janiro.<ref name=\"Biskind p390\">Biskind, Peter ''Easy Riders, Raging Bulls'', p. 390.</ref><ref name=\"Baxter p193\">Baxter, John ''De Niro A Biography'', p. 193.</ref> They were also responsible for the end sequence where LaMotta is all alone in his dressing room quoting the \"I could have been a contender\" scene from ''[[On the Waterfront]]''.<ref name=\"Baxter p193\" /> An extract of ''[[Richard III (play)|Richard III]]'' had been considered but [[Michael Powell]] thought it would be a bad decision within the context of an American film.<ref name=\"Thompson pp.76/77\" /> According to Steven Bach, the first two screenwriters (Martin and Schrader) would receive credit, but since there was no payment to the writer's guild on the script, De Niro and Scorsese's work would remain uncredited.<ref name=\"Baxter p193\" />\n\n=== Casting ===\n[[File:Cathy Moriarty and Joe Pesci, 1980.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|Cathy Moriarty (left) and Joe Pesci (right) on the set.]]\nOne of Scorsese's trademarks was casting many actors and actresses new to the profession.<ref name=\"Evans p65\">Evans, Mike ''The Making of Raging Bull'', p. 65.</ref> De Niro, who was already committed to play Jake LaMotta, began to help Scorsese track down unfamiliar names to play his on-screen brother, Joey, and wife, Vikki.<ref name=\"Evans p61\">Evans, Mike ''The Making of Raging Bull'', p. 61.</ref><ref name=\"Baxter pp196-201\">Baxter, John ''De Niro A Biography'' pp. 196\u2013201</ref> The role of Joey LaMotta was the first to be cast. De Niro was watching a low budget television film called ''[[The Death Collector]]'' when he saw the part of a young career criminal played by [[Joe Pesci]] (then an unknown and struggling actor) as an ideal candidate. Prior to receiving a call from De Niro and Scorsese for the proposal to star in the film, Pesci had not worked in film for four years and was working at an Italian restaurant in [[New Jersey]].\nThe role of Vikki (respelled as Vickie in the final film), Jake's second wife, had interest across the board, but it was Pesci who suggested actress [[Cathy Moriarty]] from a picture he once saw at a [[New Jersey]] disco.<ref name=\"Baxter pp196-201\" /> Both De Niro and Scorsese believed that Moriarty, then 18, could portray the role after meeting with her on several occasions and noticing her husky voice and physical maturity. The duo had to prove to the [[Screen Actors Guild]] that she was right for the role when [[Cis Corman]] showed 10 comparing pictures of both Moriarty and the real Vikki LaMotta for proof she had a resemblance.<ref name=\"Baxter pp196-201\" /> Moriarty was then asked to take a screen test which she managed\u2014partly aided with some improvised lines from De Niro\u2014after some confusion wondering why the crew were filming her take. Joe Pesci also persuaded his former show-biz pal and co-star in ''[[The Death Collector]]'', [[Frank Vincent]], to try for the role of Salvy Batts. Following a successful audition and screen test, Vincent received the call to say he had received the part.<ref name=\"Evans pp.65/66\">Evans, Mike, ''The Making of Raging Bull'', pp.&nbsp;65/66.</ref> [[Charles Scorsese]], the director's father, made his film debut as Tommy Como's cousin, Charlie.<ref name=\"Evans pp.65/66\" />\n\nWhile in the midst of practicing a [[Bronx accent]] and preparing for his role, De Niro met both LaMotta and his ex-wife, [[Vikki LaMotta|Vikki]], on separate occasions. Vikki, who lived in [[Florida]], told stories about her life with her former husband and also showed old home movies (that later inspired a similar sequence to be done for the film).<ref name=\"Total Film pp180-181\" /><ref name=\"Baxter p192\">Baxter, John, ''De Niro: A Biography'', p. 192.</ref> Jake LaMotta, on the other hand, served as his trainer, accompanied by [[Al Silvani]] as coach at the Gramercy club in [[New York City|New York]], getting him into shape. The actor found that boxing came naturally to him; he entered as a middleweight boxer, winning two of his three fights in a [[Brooklyn]] ring dubbed \"young LaMotta\" by the commentator. According to Jake LaMotta, De Niro was one of the top 20 best middleweight boxers of all time.<ref name=\"Total Film pp180-181\" /><ref name=\"Baxter pp196-201\" />\n\n=== Principal photography ===\n[[File:filming the boxing scenes.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.9|The filming of the boxing scenes with director, Scorsese (center left, with beard) and the director of photography, Michael Chapman (center right, with white shirt).]]\nAccording to the production mixer, Michael Evje, the film began shooting at the [[Los Angeles]] Olympic Auditorium on April 16, 1979. [[Grip (job)|Grips]] hung huge curtains of black [[duvetyne]] on all four sides of the ring area to contain the artificial smoke used extensively for visual effect. On May 7, the production moved to the [[Culver City, California|Culver City]]  Studio, Stage 3, and filmed there until the middle of June. Scorsese made it clear during filming that he did not appreciate the traditional way in films of showing fights from the spectators' view.<ref name=\"Thompson p80\" /> He insisted that one camera operated by the Director of Photography, [[Michael Chapman (cinematographer)|Michael Chapman]], would be placed inside the ring as he would play the role of an opponent keeping out of the way of other fighters so that viewers could see the emotions of the fighters, including those of Jake.<ref name=\"Baxter pp196-201\" /> The precise moves of the boxers were to be done as dance routines from the information of a book about dance instructors in the mode of [[Arthur Murray]]. A punching bag in the middle of the ring was used by De Niro between takes before he aggressively came straight on to do the next scene.<ref name=\"Baxter pp196-201\" /><ref name=\"Thompson and Christie pp83-84\">Thompson and Christie, ''Scorsese on Scorsese'', pp. 83\u201384.</ref> The initial five-week schedule for the shooting of the boxing scenes took longer than expected, putting Scorsese under pressure.<ref name=\"Baxter pp196-201\" />\n\nAccording to Scorsese, production of the film was then closed down for around four months with the entire crew being paid, so De Niro could go on a binge eating trip around [[northern Italy]] and [[France]].<ref name=\"Total Film pp180-181\" /><ref name=\"Thompson and Christie pp83-84\" /> When he did come back to the United States, his weight had increased from 145 to 215&nbsp;pounds (66 to 97&nbsp;kg).<ref name=\"Baxter pp196-201\" /> The scenes with the heftier Jake LaMotta\u2014which include announcing his retirement from boxing and LaMotta ending up in a Florida cell\u2014were completed while approaching Christmas 1979 within seven to eight weeks so as not to aggravate the health issues which were already affecting De Niro's posture, breathing, and talking.<ref name=\"Baxter pp196-201\" /><ref name=\"Thompson and Christie pp83-84\" /><ref name=\"Baxter p83\">Baxter, John, ''The Making of Raging Bull'', p. 83.</ref>\n\nAccording to Evje, Jake's nightclub sequence was filmed in a closed-down [[San Pedro, California|San Pedro]] club on December 3. The jail cell head-banging scene was shot on a constructed set with De Niro asking for minimal crew to be present\u2014there was not even a boom operator.\n\nThe final sequence where Jake LaMotta is in front of his mirror was filmed on the last day of shooting, requiring 19 takes, with only the 13th being used for the film. Scorsese wanted to have an atmosphere that would be so cold that the words would have an impact as he tries to come to terms with his relationship with his brother.<ref name=\"Thompson pp.76/77\" />\n\n=== Post-production ===\nThe editing of ''Raging Bull'' began when production was temporarily put on hold and was completed in 1980.<ref name=\"Thompson and Christie pp83-84\" /><ref name=\"Biskind p399\" /> Scorsese worked with the editor, [[Thelma Schoonmaker]], to achieve a final cut of the film. Their main decision was to abandon Schrader's idea of LaMotta's nightclub act interweaving with the flashback of his youth and instead they just followed along the lines of a single flashback where only scenes of LaMotta practicing his stand-up would be left [[bookend scene|bookending]] the film.<ref name=\"Baxter p90\">Evans, Mike ''The Making of Raging Bull'', p. 90.</ref> A sound mix arranged by [[Frank Warner (sound editor)|Frank Warner]] was a delicate process taking six months.<ref name=\"Biskind p399\" /> According to Scorsese, the sound on ''Raging Bull'' was difficult because each punch, camera shot, and flash bulb would be different.
