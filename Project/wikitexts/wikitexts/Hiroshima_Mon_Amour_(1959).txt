The film is notable for Resnais' innovative use of brief [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]]s to suggest flashes of memory, which create a [[Nonlinear narrative|nonlinear storyline]].\n\nAlong with films like ''[[Breathless (1960 film)|Breathless]]'' and ''[[The 400 Blows]]'', ''Hiroshima mon amour'' brought international attention to the new movement in French cinema and is widely considered to be one of the most influential films of the [[French New Wave]]. In particular, it was a major catalyst for [[Left Bank Cinema]].\n\n==Plot==\nA series of [[closeup]]s of the backs and arms of a man and woman embracing, amidst falling ash and then covered in sweat. In [[voiceover]], the woman recounts the aftermath of the [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|atomic bombing of Hiroshima]] that she has seen on her trip to the city, while [[newsreel]] and fictional footage of victims, protests, war memorials, and the streets and buildings of modern [[Hiroshima]] are shown. The man calmly says the woman has not seen anything, nor does she know what it is to forget. He is from Hiroshima and his family died in the bombing while he was off fighting in [[Pacific War|the war]], and the woman is a French actress who is in the city to make an anti-war film.\n\nIn the morning, the woman watches the man sleep. His twitching hand reminds her of her first love, a soldier whose hand moved similarly as he lay dying. The Japanese man wakes, and it becomes clear he and the woman met the previous night at a caf\u00e9. She learns he is an architect who is involved in politics. They discuss the bombing and the end of the war, and he is enchanted by the word \"[[Nevers]]\", her hometown, to which she never wants to return. The man says he would like to see the woman again, but she says she is flying back to [[Paris]] the next day. Neither this nor the revelation that she has children change how he feels, but she, though torn, repeatedly declines to arrange another meeting.\n\nThe man visits the woman at the [[filming location]], and she is happy to see him. He takes her back to his house. She asks if he lives alone, and he replies that his wife is out of town for a few days. They both say they are happy in their marriages, though they have had casual affairs before, and make love again. After deciding to spend the woman's remaining time in Hiroshima together, they go to a [[tea room]], where the man asks the woman to tell him more about Nevers and her life there. Intercut with flashbacks, she tells how she and an [[German military administration in occupied France during World War II|occupying German soldier]] fell in love and planned to elope to [[Bavaria]] before he was shot while waiting for her on the day Nevers was [[Liberation of France|liberated]], how she stayed with him while he died over the next two days, how the villagers shaved her head when they found out about the relationship, and how her parents locked her alternately in her room and the cellar while her hair grew out and she came out of her madness and then sent her away to Paris just before Hiroshima was bombed. She tries to convey the pain she feels about forgetting the German and their love, and indicates she has been trying to keep her distance from the Japanese man because she does not want any more such heartbreak.\n\nThe man is elated when he learns the woman never told her husband about the German, but, when they leave the tea room, she tells him to go away and that they will probably never see each other again. In her hotel room, she feels guilty about telling the man about the German, but decides to stay in Hiroshima. She goes back to the now-closed tea room, and the man finds her and asks her to stay. She weakly says she will, but then tells him again to go away. They walk around the city, together and separately, images of Hiroshima alternating with images of Nevers. The woman goes to a train station, where she lets go of some of her issues surrounding her first love and decides she might like to visit Nevers. She takes a cab to a nightclub, the man following. The place is nearly empty and they sit apart. As the sun rises, a Japanese man sits by the woman and hits on her in English.\n\nBack in the woman's hotel room, the architect knocks at the door. She lets him in and yells that she is already starting to forget him, but abruptly calms and says his name is \"Hiroshima\". He responds that it is, and her name is \"Nevers\".\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Emmanuelle Riva]] as Elle (\"Her\")\n* [[Eiji Okada]] as Lui (\"Him\")\n* [[Bernard Fresson]] as l'Allemand (\"The German\")\n* Stella Dassas as la m\u00e8re (\"The Mother\")\n* Pierre Barbaud as le p\u00e8re (\"The Father\")\n\n==Production==\nAccording to [[James Monaco]], Resnais was originally commissioned to make a short documentary about the [[atomic bomb]], but spent several months confused about how to proceed because he did not want to recreate his 1956 [[Holocaust]] documentary ''[[Night and Fog (1955 film)|Night and Fog]]''. He later went to his producer and joked that the film could not be done unless [[Marguerite Duras]] was involved in writing the screenplay.<ref name=\"Monaco\"/>\n\nThe film was a co-production by companies from both [[France]] and [[Japan]]. The producers stipulated that one main character must be French and the other Japanese, and also required that the film be shot in both countries employing film crews comprising technicians from each.<ref name=\"Monaco\">{{cite book |first=James |last=Monaco |title=''Alain Resnais'' |location=New York |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1979 |isbn=0-19-520037-3 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/alainresnais00mona_0 }}</ref>\n\nAmong the film's innovations is the way Resnais intercut very brief flashback sequences into scenes to suggest a brief flash of memory. He later used a similar effect in ''[[Last Year at Marienbad]]'' (1961) and ''[[The War Is Over (1966 film)|The War Is Over]]'' (1966).\n\n==Film references==\nIn his book on Resnais, James Monaco ends his chapter on ''Hiroshima mon amour'' by claiming that the film contains a reference to the classic 1942 film ''[[Casablanca (film)|Casablanca]]'':\n{{cquote|Here is an 'impossible' love story between two people struggling with the imagery of a distant war. At the end of this romantic, poignant movie about leave takings and responsibilities, the two fateful lovers meet in a cafe.  Resnais gives us a rare establishing shot of the location. 'He' is going to meet 'She' for the last time at a bar called 'The Casablanca' - right here in the middle of Hiroshima! It's still the same old story. A fight for love and glory. A case of do or die. The world will always welcome lovers.

He notes, for example, that the [[Japanese language|Japanese-language]] arrival and departure time announcements in the train scenes bear no relation to the time of day in which the scenes are set. Also, people pass through [[noren]] curtains into shops which are supposedly closed. The noren is a traditional sign that a shop is open for business and is invariably taken down at closing time.<ref>Richie, Donald ''Japan Journals: 1947-2004'', Berkeley: Stone Bridge Press, 2004, p126</ref>\n\n==In popular culture==\n\n===Music===\nThe film has inspired several songs.\n* The English band [[Ultravox (band)|Ultravox]] recorded a song called \"Hiroshima Mon Amour\" for their 1977 album ''[[Ha!-Ha!-Ha!]]''. The song was later covered by the Australian band [[The Church (band)|The Church]] on their all-covers album ''[[A Box of Birds]]'' in 1999. Another notable version was recorded by [[Jan Linton]] on his [[King Records (Japan)|King Records]] Japan-only album ''Planet Japan'' in 2004. The song is still performed live by former Ultravox! singer [[John Foxx]], with his current group [[John Foxx and the Maths]].\n* In 1983, the rock band [[Alcatrazz]] recorded a song called \"Hiroshima Mon Amour\" for their debut album ''[[No Parole from Rock 'n' Roll]]''. The song was written by English singer [[Graham Bonnet]] (ex-[[Rainbow (rock band)|Rainbow]]) with Swedish guitar virtuoso [[Yngwie Malmsteen]]. Bonnet\u2019s lyrics and song title were inspired by the film, which he had seen in school. The song became one of the band\u2019s most popular and was still being performed live (in 2017) by the Graham Bonnet Band.\n* In 2004, the Peruvian band [[El Hombre Misterioso]] released the album ''Pez Raro'', which included the song \"Mon Amour\". The lyrics and song title were inspired by the film. The line \"Hiroshima Mon Amour\" is heard in the chorus.\n* In 2008, [[The (International) Noise Conspiracy]] released the album ''[[The Cross of My Calling]]'', which included the song \"Hiroshima Mon Amour\".\n* John Cale's 1979 album ''Sabotage'' features the song \"Dr. Mudd\", which references ''Hiroshima Mon Amour''.<ref name=\"Mudd\">{{Cite web |title=John Cale \u2013 Dr. Mudd |url=https://genius.com/John-cale-dr-mudd-lyrics |access-date=2022-02-09 |website=Genius}}</ref>\n\n===Film===\n* In 2001, [[cinema of Japan|Japanese]] [[film director]] [[Nobuhiro Suwa]] directed ''[[H Story]]'', a [[docufiction]] about his attempt to remake ''Hiroshima Mon Amour''.<ref name=\"cannes-2001.com\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/2001433/year/2001.html |title=Festival de Cannes: H Story |access-date=2009-10-19|work=festival-cannes.com}}</ref>\n* In 2003, [[Iran]]ian film director Bahman Pour-Azar released ''[[Where Or When (film)|Where Or When]]''. The 85-minute film places Pour-Azar's characters in the same circumstances as Resnais's nearly a half century later. However, the current global tension of today's world is the backdrop instead of post-war Hiroshima. When screening the film, Stuart Alson, who founded the New York International Independent Film and Video Festival, said the piece was \"a parallel line of work with the French masterpiece ''Hiroshima mon amour''\".<ref name=\"Top French Films\">{{Cite web |title=Best French Films Ever. 39.
