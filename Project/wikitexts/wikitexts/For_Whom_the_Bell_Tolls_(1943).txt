The screenwriter [[Dudley Nichols]] based his script on the 1940 novel ''[[For Whom the Bell Tolls]]'' by American novelist [[Ernest Hemingway]]. The film is about an American [[International Brigades]] volunteer, Robert Jordan (Cooper), who is fighting in the [[Spanish Civil War]] against the [[fascism|fascists]]. During his desperate mission to blow up a strategically important bridge to protect Republican forces, Jordan falls in love with a young woman guerrilla fighter (Bergman).\n\n''For Whom the Bell Tolls'' was Ingrid Bergman's first [[Technicolor]] film. Hemingway's desire for Cooper and Bergman for the leading roles was much publicized, but Paramount initially cast [[Vera Zorina]] with Cooper. After shooting footage with Zorina's hair cut short (truer to the novel's character \u2014 a shorn head \u2014 than Bergman's \"look\" in the film), she was replaced with Bergman.<ref>\"Ingrid Bergman Replaces Zorina.\" ''[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]'', 5 August 1942.</ref>\n\nThe day's papers described the recasting: \"They [Paramount] compromised on Zorina's hair, cutting it to two inches; the rest of the makeup was true to the book. The results were shown to Paramount executives. They gasped. 'No glamour,' they explained. 'She looks like a dishrag.' Sam Wood, producer-director, sighed. 'The part doesn't call for glamour,' he tried to explain. 'Well, she ought to have glamour without looking like it.' They tried it. They put caps on Zorina's teeth, touched up her facial makeup with a bit of mascara here and there, tailored the baggy pants to a slim hip, and gave the shirt an uplift. She looked more like the lovely Zorina but not at all like the hapless 'Maria.' They gave up. Miss Bergman was tested for the part. The tests were made with her hair long and the executives beamed. She looked glamorous. Tomorrow they will cut her hair short. They will dress her in baggy pants and a formless shirt. After that, no one knows.\"<ref>\"Zorina Loses Role of 'Maria' When Makeup Loses Glamour.\" Buffalo Evening News, 5 August 1942. (A widely-syndicated United Press article)</ref>\n\nThe film was nominated for nine [[Academy Awards]], winning one. [[Victor Young]]'s soundtrack for the film was the first complete score from an American film to be issued on record.<ref>Patrick Robinson. 1980.

An experienced dynamiter, Jordan is ordered to travel behind enemy lines and destroy a critical bridge with the aid of a band of local anti-fascist [[guerrillas]]. The bridge must be blown up to prevent enemy troops from traveling across it to respond to an upcoming offensive against the fascists.\n\n[[File:For Whom The Bell Tolls trailer ss 07.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The guerrilla fighters plan their mission.]]\nJordan meets an old man, Anselmo, who is a guerrilla fighter who will serve as Jordan's liaison with the local guerrilla fighters. Anselmo leads Jordan to a group of Republican guerrillas who are led by a middle-aged man named Pablo. Jordan falls in love with one of the guerrillas, a young woman named Mar\u00eda. Mar\u00eda's life was shattered by her parents' execution and her gang-rape at the hands of the [[Falangism|Falangists]] (part of the [[Nationalist faction (Spanish Civil War)|fascist coalition]]) at the outbreak of the war. Jordan has a strong sense of duty, which clashes with the unwillingness of the guerrilla leader Pablo to commit to helping with the bridge-blowing operation, as it would endanger himself and his band. At the same time, Jordan develops a new-found lust for life which arises from his love for Mar\u00eda. Pablo's wife Pilar displaces Pablo as the group leader and pledges the allegiance of the guerrillas to Jordan's mission. However, when another band of anti-fascist guerrillas, led by El Sordo, is surrounded and killed in a desperate [[last stand]], Pablo destroys Jordan's dynamite detonation equipment, hoping to prevent the bridge demolition and thereby avoid fascist reprisals on his camp. Later, Pablo regrets abandoning his comrades and returns to assist in the operation.\n\n[[File:For Whom The Bell Tolls trailer ss 05.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The old man Anselmo (played by [[Vladimir Sokoloff]]), who acts as Robert Jordan's guide.]]\nHowever, the enemy, apprised of the coming offensive, has prepared to ambush the Republicans in force and it seems unlikely that blowing up the bridge will do much to prevent a [[rout]]. Regardless, Jordan understands that he must still demolish the bridge in an attempt to prevent fascist reinforcements from overwhelming his allies. Lacking the equipment destroyed by Pablo, Jordan and Anselmo improvise an alternative method to explode the dynamite by using [[hand grenade]]s. Jordan attaches wires to the grenades so that their pins can be pulled from a distance. This improvised plan is considerably more dangerous than using conventional detonators, because the men must increase their proximity to the explosion.\n\nWhile the guerrilla fighters\u2014Pablo, Pilar, and Mar\u00eda\u2014create a diversion for Jordan and Anselmo, the two men plant and detonate the dynamite, costing Anselmo his life when he is hit by a piece of debris from the exploding bridge. While the guerrillas are escaping on horseback, Jordan is maimed when a fascist tank shoots his horse out from under him. Jordan cannot feel his legs and he knows that if his comrades stop to rescue him, they too will be captured or killed. He bids goodbye to Mar\u00eda and ensures that she escapes to safety with the surviving guerrillas. Armed with a [[Lewis gun|Lewis machine gun]], he waits until the horse-mounted fascist soldiers appear in his gun sights. He then pulls the trigger, firing a sweeping barrage at the oncoming soldiers. The film ends with Jordan firing the Lewis gun directly at the camera.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:For Whom The Bell Tolls trailer.jpg|thumb|right|260px|Guerrilla fighters Robert Jordan (Cooper) and Maria (Bergman) embrace.]]\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Gary Cooper]] as Robert Jordan\n* [[Ingrid Bergman]] as Mar\u00eda\n* [[Akim Tamiroff]] as Pablo\n* [[Arturo de C\u00f3rdova]] as Agust\u00edn\n* [[Vladimir Sokoloff]] as Anselmo, the guide\n* [[Mikhail Rasumny]] as Rafael, the gypsy\n* [[Fortunio Bonanova]] as Fernando\n* Eric Feldary as Andr\u00e9s, the courier\n* [[Victor Varconi]] as Primitivo, the lookout\n* [[Joseph Calleia]] as El Sordo\n* Lilo Yarson as Joaquin\n* [[Katina Paxinou]] as Pilar\n* [[Alexander Granach]] as Paco\n* Adia Kuznetzoff as Gustavo\n* Leonid Snegoff as Ignacio\n* Leo Bulgakov as General [[Karol \u015awierczewski|Golz]]\n* [[Duncan Renaldo]] as Lieutenant Berrendo\n* [[Frank Puglia]] as Captain Gomez\n* [[Pedro de Cordoba]] as Colonel Miranda\n* [[Michael Visaroff]] as Staff Officer\n* [[Martin Garralaga]] as Captain Mora\n* [[Jean Del Val]] as The Sniper\n* [[John Mylong]] as Colonel Duval\n}}\n\n==Restoration==\nThe film was originally released in a [[roadshow]] format, at 170 minutes (not counting intermission). For re-release, it was trimmed to 134 minutes, and it was not seen at its full length until the late 1990s, when it was archivally restored to 168 minutes. This restored version is the one that has been released on [[DVD]]. The restoration was photochemical, not digital, and the titles and some of the scenes in the early reels are slightly to significantly out-of-register.\n\n==Reception==\n''For Whom the Bell Tolls'' was [[1943 in film|the second-highest-grossing film of 1943]], earning $6.3 million in distributor rentals in the United States and Canada.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://archive.org/stream/variety163-1946-09#page/n180/mode/1up|title=All-Time Top Grossers|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=September 25, 1946|page=5}}</ref> A re-issue in 1957 earned an additional $800,000.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.archive.org/stream/variety209-1958-01#page/n4/mode/1up|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=January 1, 1958|page=5|title='For Whom the Bell Tolls' (1943) Estimated Repeat Take, $800,000|access-date=February 22, 2019}}</ref> When adjusted for inflation and the size of the population when released, it ranks among the top 100 popular movies of all time at the domestic box office.<ref>{{cite web|title=Top 100 Movies 1927-2021 by Box Office Popularity|url=https://www.bestmoviesof.com/article/Top_100_Box_Office|website=Best Movies Of}}</ref>\n\n==Accolades==\n\n===16th Academy Awards===\n;Wins<ref name=\"Oscar\">{{cite web |url=http://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/1944 |title=The 16th Academy Awards (1943) Nominees and Winners|access-date=2014-02-27|work=[[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]]}}</ref><ref name=\"NY Times\">{{cite web |url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/91991/For-Whom-the-Bell-Tolls/awards |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121017225605/http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/91991/For-Whom-the-Bell-Tolls/awards |url-status=dead |archive-date=2012-10-17 |department=Movies & TV Dept. |work=[[The New York Times]] |publisher=[[Baseline (database)|Baseline]] & [[All Movie Guide]] |date=2012 |title=NY Times: For Whom the Bell Tolls |access-date=2008-12-16}}</ref>\n[[File:For Whom The Bell Tolls trailer ss 06.jpg|thumb|right|260px|Robert Jordan (Cooper) rigs the bridge with explosives.]]\n* [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Actress in a Supporting Role]]: Katina Paxinou\n\n;Nominations\n* [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Outstanding Motion Picture]]: Paramount\n* [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]]: Gary Cooper\n* [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]]: Ingrid Bergman\n* [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Actor in a Supporting Role]]: Akim Tamiroff\n* [[Academy Award for Best Cinematography|Best Cinematography (Color)]]: [[Ray Rennahan]]\n* [[Academy Award for Best Art Direction|Best Art Direction (Color)]]: ''Art Direction:'' [[Hans Dreier]], [[Haldane Douglas]]; ''Interior Decoration:'' [[Bertram Granger]]\n* [[Academy Award for Film Editing|Best Film Editing]]: Sherman Todd, [[John F.
