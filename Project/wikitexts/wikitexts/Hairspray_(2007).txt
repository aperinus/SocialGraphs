Produced by [[Ingenious Media]] and Zadan/Meron Productions, and adapted from both Waters's 1988 script and [[Thomas Meehan (writer)|Thomas Meehan]] and Mark O'Donnell's book for the stage musical by screenwriter [[Leslie Dixon]], the film was directed and choreographed by [[Adam Shankman]] and has an [[ensemble cast]] including [[John Travolta]], [[Michelle Pfeiffer]], [[Christopher Walken]], [[Amanda Bynes]], [[James Marsden]], [[Queen Latifah]], [[Brittany Snow]], [[Zac Efron]], [[Elijah Kelley]], [[Allison Janney]], and [[Nikki Blonsky]] in her feature film debut. Set in 1962 [[Baltimore|Baltimore, Maryland]], the film follows the \"pleasantly plump\" teenager Tracy Turnblad (Blonsky) as she pursues stardom as a dancer on a local television dance show and rallies against [[racial segregation]].\n\nThe film began development in 2004, and Dixon reworked Meehan and O'Donnell's first draft of the screenplay to tone down the musical's campiness. In 2005, Shankman agreed to direct the film. Composer/lyricist [[Marc Shaiman]] and lyricist [[Scott Wittman]] reworked their songs from the Broadway musical for the film's soundtrack, and also wrote four new songs for the film. Principal photography commenced in September 2006 with a budget of $75 million, and ended in December of that year; filming took place on locations in [[Toronto]] and [[Hamilton, Ontario]], Canada and on soundstages at Toronto's Showline Studios. Recording sessions for the film's songs and soundtrack took place in [[San Diego, California]] in the [[United States]].\n\n''Hairspray'' premiered on July 10, 2007, at the [[Fox Theater, Westwood Village|Mann Village Theater]] and was released on July 20, 2007, in the United States and the United Kingdom.

Along with her best friend Penny Pingleton, Tracy frequently watches ''The Corny Collins Show'', a local teen dance television show.\n\nThe teenagers who dance on the show attend Tracy and Penny's high school, among them Amber von Tussle and her boyfriend Link Larkin, the lead dancers. Amber's mother, Velma, manages the station WYZT, [[nepotism|ensuring that Amber is prominently featured]]. Corny Collins and the dancers on the show are White, and Velma only allows African-American dancers on the show once a month on \"Negro Day\", hosted by local [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]] disc jockey Motormouth Maybelle.\n\nOne day, one of the dancers on the show takes a leave of absence, and auditions for a replacement are held the next day. Tracy attends, but Velma rejects for her overweight physique and for supporting [[Racial integration|integration]]. Tracy is given detention for missing class in order to attend the audition, and discovers the \"Negro Day\" kids practicing in the detention room. Tracy befriends Seaweed, Motormouth Maybelle's son, who teaches Tracy several dance moves. As Tracy leaves detention, she inadvertently meets Link, and dreams of a life with him. At a [[record hop]], Tracy's new moves garner Corny's attention, and he chooses her to join the show.\n\nTracy quickly becomes one of Corny's most popular performers, affecting Amber's chances of winning the show's annual \"Miss Teenage Hairspray\" pageant and her relationship with Link, as he grows fonder of Tracy. Mr. Pinky suggests that Tracy should be the spokesgirl for his Hefty Hideaway boutique. Tracy persuades her [[Agoraphobia|agoraphobic]] mother, Edna, to accompany her to the boutique as her agent.\n\nTracy introduces Seaweed to Penny, and the two become smitten. Later, Seaweed and his younger sister Little Inez take Tracy, Penny, and Link to a party at Maybelle's store. Edna finds Tracy there and tries taking her home, but Maybelle convinces her to stay, and tells her to take pride in herself. At the party, Maybelle informs everyone that Velma has cancelled \"Negro Day\", and Tracy suggests that they march for integration. Link is unwilling to jeopardize his career by marching, straining his relationship with Tracy. Edna returns to her husband Wilbur's shop, but Velma gets there first, and tries to seduce him. After accusing Wilbur of [[infidelity]], Edna forbids Tracy to be on the show, which was Velma\u2019s intention. She changes her mind after she and Wilbur reconcile.\n\nThe next morning, Tracy sneaks out of the house to join the protest, which is halted by a police roadblock. The protesters engage in a brawl, while Tracy runs to the Pingletons' home, where Penny allows her to hide in a [[fallout shelter]]. However, Penny's mother Prudy reports Tracy to the police and ties her daughter to her bed for \"harboring a fugitive\". Having been bailed out by Wilbur, Seaweed and his friends help Tracy and Penny escape. Link visits Tracy's house to find her, and realizes that he loves her. Seaweed and Penny also acknowledge their love during the escape.\n\nWith the pageant underway, Velma assigns police officers to guard the WYZT studio to prevent Tracy from entering. She also rigs the pageant tallies to guarantee that Amber will win. Penny arrives at the pageant with Edna, while Wilbur, Seaweed, and the Negro Day kids help Tracy infiltrate the studio. Link breaks away from Amber to dance with Tracy; later, he pulls Little Inez to the stage to dance in the pageant.\n\nAmber's attempt to re-claim her championship crown fails. Little Inez wins the pageant after a late surge of support, successfully integrating ''The Corny Collins Show''. Velma tells Amber about her rigging scheme in front of a camera manned by Edna, resulting in her firing. ''The Corny Collins Show'' set turns into a celebration as Tracy and Link kiss.\n\n==Cast==\n;Main characters\n* [[Nikki Blonsky]] as Tracy Turnblad, an optimistic, overweight teenage girl who loves dancing.

Another \"new\" song in the 2007 film, \"The New Girl in Town\", had originally been composed for the Broadway musical, but was deemed unnecessary and discarded from the musical.

He wore silicone prosthetics on his head and neck, and foam latex arms and legs that connected to a spandex and foam body suit.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}\n\n===Adaptation changes===\nDixon was primarily hired to tone down much of the [[Camp (style)|campiness]] inherent in the stage musical.<ref name=\"ScriptMag\">Verini, Bob (July /August 2007). \"Miss Beehive-ing: Leslie Dixon styles ''Hairspray'' for the Big Screen.\" ''Script''. pp. 60-66</ref> The 2007 film's script is based primarily on the stage musical rather than the 1988 film, so several changes already made to the plot for the stage version remain in this version. These include dropping several characters from the 1988 version (such as Arvin Hodgepile (the role Mr. Spritzer fills), Velma's husband Franklin, Corny's assistant Tammy, the [[beatnik]]s, et al.), removing the Tilted Acres amusement park from the story, and placing Velma in charge of the station where ''The Corny Collins Show'' is filmed.\n\nOne notable difference between the stage musical, the original film, and the 2007 film version of ''Hairspray'' is that Tracy does not go to jail in the 2007 version (thus eliminating the musical's song \"The Big Dollhouse\"). In both previous incarnations of ''Hairspray'', Tracy is arrested and taken to jail along with the other protesters. Edna is presented in this version as an insecure introvert, in contrast to the relatively bolder incarnations present in the 1988 film and the stage musical.<ref name=\"ScriptMag\"/> Among many other elements changed or added to this version are the removal of Motormouth Maybelle's habit of speaking in rhyming [[African American Vernacular English|jive talk]] and doubling the number of teens in Corny Collins' Council (from ten on Broadway to twenty in the 2007 film).<ref name=\"Shankman13\">{{cite web|last=Shankman |first=Adam |title=The Director's Chair: Adam Shankman's Hairspray Diary #13 |website=BroadwayWorld.com |date=July 21, 2007 |url=https://www.broadwayworld.com/article/The-Directors-Chair-Adam-Shankmans-Hairspray-Diary-13-20070723 |access-date=February 10, 2022}}</ref>\n\nDixon restructured portions of ''Hairspray''{{'}}s book to allow several of the songs to blend more naturally into the plot, in particular \"(You're) Timeless to Me\" and \"I Know Where I've Been\". \"(You're) Timeless to Me\" becomes the anchor of a newly invented subplot involving Velma's attempt to break up Edna and Wilbur's marriage and keep Tracy off ''The Corny Collins Show'' as a result. The song now serves as Wilbur's apology to Edna, in addition to its original purpose in the stage musical as a [[tongue-in-cheek]] declaration of Wilbur and Edna's love for each other.<ref name=\"ScriptMag\"/> Meanwhile, \"I Know Where I've Been\", instead of being sung by Maybelle to the kids after being let out of jail, now underscores Maybelle's march on WYZT (which takes place in the stage musical at the end of \"Big, Blonde, and Beautiful\").<ref name=\"ScriptMag\"/>\n\nThe song \"Big, Blonde, and Beautiful\" was inspired by a line that Tracy delivered in the original film (\"Now all of Baltimore will know: I'm big, blonde and beautiful!\"), but in the stage version and in this film, Motormouth Maybelle performs the song. A reprise of the song was added to the 2007 film, which is sung by Edna and Velma.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}\n\n===Pre-production and casting===\n''Hairspray'' was produced on a budget of $75 million.<ref name=\"budget\">{{cite news|last=Marr |first=Merissa |title=At 20, ''Hairspray'' Gets a Third \"Do\". |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |date=May 25, 2007 |url=http://i53.photobucket.com/albums/g52/Hairspray-Movie-Musical/WallStreetJournal-may25.jpg |access-date=May 28, 2007}}</ref> Casting director, David Rubin, introduced an open casting call to cast unknowns in [[Atlanta, Georgia|Atlanta]], [[New York City]], and [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]].
