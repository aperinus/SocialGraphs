The film stars [[Kevin Costner]], [[Ashton Kutcher]] and [[Melissa Sagemiller]]. The title of the film refers to a legendary figure within the film which protects people lost at sea: \"the Guardian\". The film focuses on the [[United States Coast Guard]] and their [[Aviation Survival Technician]] program. ''The Guardian'' was released on September 29, 2006.\n\nIt is also loosely based on the Japanese film ''[[Umizaru (2004 film)|Umizaru]]'' (2004).\n\n{{TOC limit|limit=2}}\n\n==Plot==\nThe film opens with a description of a legend told by people who have survived being lost at sea: a presence, referred to as the Guardian, which pushed them to the surface, enabling them to survive until help arrived.\n\nBen Randall ([[Kevin Costner]]) is the top rescue swimmer at the [[United States Coast Guard]]'s [[Aviation Survival Technician]] (AST) program, but the long hours have destroyed his marriage. When on a rescue, Ben loses his team in a [[Sikorsky MH-60 Jayhawk|HH-60J Jayhawk]] helicopter crash at sea. While waiting in a survival raft, his best friend, [[Chief petty officer (United States)|Chief Petty Officer]] Carl Billings ([[Omari Hardwick]]), dies. Shaken by [[survivor guilt]], Ben is transferred to become an instructor at the Coast Guard AST training school. He develops a legendary reputation among the students for his high number of rescues.\n\nJake Fischer ([[Ashton Kutcher]]) is a hot-shot candidate for AST. Ranked as a top high school competitive swimmer with scholarships to every [[Ivy League]] college, Jake instead opts to enlist in the Coast Guard. During training, Jake meets local schoolteacher, Emily Thomas ([[Melissa Sagemiller]]), and they begin a casual relationship.\n\nThe initial weeks of training end with most of the students dropping out and advanced instruction begins. Jake is late for class and Ben punishes his entire class for his tardiness. Believing Jake to be lazy and unmotivated, Ben tries to force him to quit. He gradually begins to see Jake's persistence and dedication.\n\nJake meets Emily in a bar and tells her about beating Ben's old records. The bartender, a friend of Ben's, tells Jake about a time when Ben injured himself saving every victim from a burning hospital ship full of invalid patients.\n\nLater, a friend of Jake's is afraid of failing school because he is unable to cope with panicked victims in the water. Jake takes him out for a drink at a Navy bar to cheer him up. They get in a fight and land in jail after being badly beaten by the Navy sailors, causing Jake to miss a date with Emily. Jake returns to base and takes the blame for the fight.\n\nChief Aviation Survival Technician Jack Skinner ([[Neal McDonough]]) bails Jake out. Back on base, Ben and Jake get into a confrontation about their pasts. It is revealed that during high school, Jake was involved in a car crash while on the way home with his teammates. It is revealed Jake lost the flip to be the designated driver and, although completely sober, blames himself for the accident. The two bond over the common experience of being the only survivor of fatal accidents. They return to the bar and fight the sailors again, this time winning.\n\nAt graduation, only a handful of candidates remain. Jake has emerged as a leader during training. Emily attends his graduation, but they end their relationship because Jake is leaving for an assignment at [[Coast Guard Air Station Kodiak|CG Air Station Kodiak]], [[Alaska]], Ben's previous post.\n\nBen and Jake are sent to rescue two kayakers trapped in a cave. Ben experiences flashbacks and Jake must guide him, but the rescue is eventually successful. Ben decides to retire after this. He tells Jake that the only record he kept track of was the 22 people he lost during his career. Ben apologizes to his wife and indicates he will not contest the divorce.\n\nJake is sent to rescue the crew of a sinking fishing trawler. During the rescue, he becomes trapped in the ship. His helicopter is forced to return to base, where Ben hears of the situation and decides to suit up and go out to rescue Jake personally. He frees Jake from the hull. As they are winched upwards towards the helicopter, their combined weight causes the winch cable to begin separating. Knowing that the cable will break, Ben unclips himself so that Jake can survive. Jake catches him, but Ben removes his glove and slips free, plummeting into the ocean. His body is never found.\n\nMuch later, Jake is on a rescue mission, when one of the survivors repeats the legend of the Guardian to him. Jake connects the legend to Ben. He then surprises Emily when she is teaching her class at school, telling her that he lied to her. \"I can't do just 'casual,'\" he says, referencing their commitment earlier to keep things uncommitted. She smiles as they embrace and kiss.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Kevin Costner]] as Senior Chief Aviation Survival Technician Ben Randall\n* [[Ashton Kutcher]] as Airman / Aviation Survival Technician Third Class Jake Fischer\n* [[Neal McDonough]] as Chief Aviation Survival Technician Jack Skinner\n* [[Melissa Sagemiller]] as Emily Thomas\n* [[Leigh Hennessy]] as Drowning Woman\n* [[Clancy Brown]] as Captain William Hadley\n* [[Brian Geraghty]] as Aviation Survival Technician Third Class Billy Hodge\n* [[Sela Ward]] as Helen Randall\n* [[Omari Hardwick]] as Chief Petty Officer Carl Billings\n* [[Michael Rady]] as Zingaro\n* Peter Gail as Airman Danny Doran\n* Shelby Fenner as Airman Cate Lindsey\n* Damon Lipari as Damon Bennett\n* [[Bonnie Bramlett]] as Maggie McGlone\n* [[John Heard (actor)|John Heard]] as Captain Frank Larson\n* [[Dul\u00e9 Hill]] as Airman Ken Weatherly\n* [[Brian Patrick Wade]] as Mitch Lyons\n* [[Joe Arquette]] as Co-Pilot Antunez\n* Andrew Schanno as Pilot Henry Mitchell\n* [[Tilky Jones]] as Tilky Flint\n* Jeff Loftus as USCG Commander, Executive Officer \n* Daniel Molthen as Richard Wakefield\n* Bryce Cass as Manny\n* [[Chicago Catz]] as Band In Bar\n* [[Travis Willingham]] as Travis Finley\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n[[Image:WavepoolGuardian.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A [[wave pool]] used during filming]]\n[[Image:GimbleBoatGuardian.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A ship located on a hydraulic [[gimbal]] used for filming]]\n\nDavid Dobkin was originally slated to direct ''The Guardian'' until being replaced by Andrew Davis. Ron Brinkerhoff was also originally involved, making the pitch for a mid-six-figure-budgeted film, before [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] took over the production.<ref name=\"Notes\"/>\n\nFollowing the series of [[Tropical cyclone|hurricanes]] [[Hurricane Katrina|in the southern United States]] in 2005, production moved to [[Shreveport, Louisiana]]. Some of the base scenes were filmed at [[Barksdale Air Force Base]] in [[Bossier City, Louisiana]] and at Camp Minden in [[Minden, Louisiana]]. Some of the scenes that were supposed to be filmed in [[Kodiak, Alaska]] were actually filmed at [[Coast Guard Air Station Elizabeth City|CG Air Station Elizabeth City]], [[North Carolina]]. Sixty thousand pounds of ice were needed on the set. The training pool used in the movie was [[Louisiana State University Shreveport|LSU\u2013Shreveport]]'s [[natatorium]].\nThe wave scenes were filmed at Louisiana Wave Studio, Metropolitan Ave, Lynbrook, Shreveport.<ref>32\u00b024'39.6\"N 93\u00b044'42.6\"W\nhttps://goo.gl/maps/LdLCAtGwkH52</ref>\n\nThe film was revised after [[Hurricane Katrina]], with the addition of several comments on the storm and the rescues. The end credits are replete with \"glory\" shots of U.S. Coast Guard helicopters conducting rescues in the greater New Orleans area. The [[DVD-Video|DVD]] contains a special feature on U.S. Coast Guard rescue operations, especially in the aftermath of Katrina.<ref name=\"Notes\">[http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/641827/Guardian-The/misc-notes.html \"Miscellaneous notes: 'The Guardian' (2006).\"] ''Turner Classic Movies''. Retrieved January 4, 2016.</ref>\n\nMany of the supporting actors in ''The Guardian'', including ASTC instructors, helicopter pilots, and support personnel, are actual U.S. Coast Guard rescue swimmers, pilots, and ground personnel. Several characters, including Kutcher's, identify themselves as [[airman|airmen]]. An airman is the enlisted rating of a Coast Guardsman who is undesignated and/or currently undergoing training in an aviation related field. Similar ratings within the Coast Guard are those of [[Seaman (rank)|seaman]] and [[Firefighter|fireman]].\n\nOne of the students was [[Mark Gangloff]], an Olympic swimmer who received a gold medal in the [[2004 Summer Olympics|Athens Olympic Games]]. The production company hired local contractors to build a massive indoor [[wave pool]] for production.\n\n==Historical relevance==\nThe mishap in ''The Guardian'' where Randall loses his crew is loosely based on an actual U.S. Coast Guard aviation mishap in Alaska. The aircraft was an [[Sikorsky S-61R|HH-3F Pelican]] (USCG variant of the Jolly Green Giant) instead of the [[Sikorsky MH-60 Jayhawk|HH-60J Jayhawk]] (USCG variant of the Blackhawk/Seahawk) pictured in the movie.<ref>[http://www.check-six.com/Coast_Guard/7_Aug_1981_HH-3F_crash.htm \"U.S. Coast Guard Aviation Fatalities.\"] ''Check-Six.com''. Retrieved January 3, 2016.-</ref>\n\n===Alternate ending===\nIn an alternate ending to ''The Guardian'', found on the DVD, Randall survives. As he unhooks and tries to fall, Jake again grabs him and vows not to let go. Instead of unstrapping his glove, Randall lets the cable pull them up and it breaks just as they get into the helicopter. This ending was added because some of the writers were worried that the original ending was too strong for viewers. Nonetheless, it was scrapped when [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] chairman, [[Dick Cook]], applauded the original ending.\n\n==Soundtrack==\n{{Infobox album\n| name       = The Guardian\n| type       = [[Soundtrack]]\n| artist     = Various artists\n| cover      = \n| caption    = \n| alt        =\n| released   = September 12, 2006\n| recorded   =\n| venue      =\n| studio     =\n| genre      =\n| length     =\n| label      =\n| producer   = Various artists\n| prev_title =\n| prev_year  =\n| next_title =\n| next_year  =\n}}\n{{Album ratings\n| rev1      = [[iTunes]]\n| rev1Score = {{Rating|3|5}} [https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/the-guardian-original-soundtrack/id187500115 link]\n}}\n\nThe soundtrack of ''The Guardian'' was released by [[Hollywood Records]] on September 12, 2006.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Guardian Original Soundtrack|url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00138KKS0|access-date=November 6, 2010}}</ref> The soundtrack uses a variety of music genres, including R&B, country music, rock, soul and blues.\n\n;Track listing\n{{Track listing\n| total_length = 50:29\n| title1 = Never Let Go\n| note1 = performed by [[Bryan Adams]]\n| length1 = 5:05\n| title2 = Something to Talk About\n| note2 = performed by [[Shedaisy]]\n| length2 = 3:54\n| title3 = Saturday Night\n| note3 = performed by [[Ozomatli]]\n| length3 = 4:01\n| title4 = Love & Happiness\n| note4 = performed by [[Bonnie Bramlett]]\n| length4 = 4:32\n| title5 = The Mockingbird\n| note5 = performed by [[Lisa Lavie]]\n| length5 = 3:07\n| title6 = Hold Tight\n| note6 = performed by [[Tad Robinson]]\n| length6 = 4:03\n| title7 = Tri-Me\n| note7 = performed by Abby Ahmad\n| length7 = 4:33\n| title8 = Hold On, I'm Coming\n| note8 = performed by [[Bonnie Bramlett]]\n| length8 = 2:57\n| title9 = Shake Up the World\n| note9 = performed by Stevie \"Funkworm\" Butler\n| length9 = 4:09\n| title10 = Friday Night\n| note10 = performed by [[Cheryl Wilson]]\n| length10 = 3:00\n| title11 = Run Me in the Dirt (Throwdown)\n| note11 = performed by Butch Flythe & Joseph \"Butch\" Flythe\n| length11 = 3:29\n| title12 = The Guardian Suite\n| note12 = performed by [[Trevor Rabin]]\n| length12 = 7:39\n}}\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Box office===\n''The Guardian'' earned $18 million on its opening weekend (#2 at the box office behind ''[[Open Season (2006 film)|Open Season]]''), and almost $95 million worldwide by January 4, 2007.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Guardian|publisher=[[Box Office Mojo]]|url=https://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=guardian06.htm|access-date=February 21, 2010}}</ref>\n\n===Critical reception===\nAt [[Rotten Tomatoes]], ''The Guardian'' received a 37% \"Rotten\" rating, based on 149 reviews.
