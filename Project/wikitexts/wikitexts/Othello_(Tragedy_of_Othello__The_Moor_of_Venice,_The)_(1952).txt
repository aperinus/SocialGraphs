Recipient of the ''Grand Prix du Festival International du Film'' (precursory name for the ''[[Palme d'Or]]''<ref>[http://data.bnf.fr/13751593/othello___film/ ''Othello'' description page] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200228081725/https://data.bnf.fr/13751593/othello___film/ |date=2020-02-28 }} in the ''[[Biblioth\u00e8que nationale de France]]'' website</ref>) at the [[1952 Cannes Film Festival]], the film was distributed by [[United Artists]] when it was released in the United States in 1955. ''Othello'' was filmed on location over a three-year period in [[Morocco]], [[Venice]], [[Tuscany]] and [[Rome]] and at the Scalera Studios in Rome.\n\nIn addition to Orson Welles, the cast consisted of [[Miche\u00e1l Mac Liamm\u00f3ir]] as [[Iago]] (one of his only starring film roles), [[Robert Coote]] as Roderigo, [[Suzanne Cloutier]] as [[Desdemona]], Michael Laurence as [[Michael Cassio|Cassio]], [[Fay Compton]] as Emilia and [[Doris Dowling]] as Bianca. Three different versions of the film have seen theatrical release \u2014 two supervised by Welles, and a 1992 restoration supervised by his daughter, [[Beatrice Welles]].\n\n==Plot==\n{{Further|Othello#Plot}}\n\nThe film closely follows the plot of the play, but restructures and reorders individual scenes. Welles trimmed the source material, which is generally around three hours when performed, down to a little over 90 minutes for the film.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9501E7DF123FE43ABC4B52DFBF66838E649EDE|title=Othello (1955) Screen: Orson Welles Revises 'Othello'; Scraps Shakespeare's Plot for Visual Effect|work=The New York Times|date=13 September 1955 |access-date=2012-01-07|last1=Crowther |first1=Bosley }}</ref>\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Othello-Welles-Cloutier.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|[[Orson Welles]] and [[Suzanne Cloutier]] in ''Othello'']]\n\nOne of Welles' more complicated shoots, ''Othello'' was filmed erratically over three years. Shooting began in 1949, but was forced to shut down when the film's original Italian producer announced on one of the first days of shooting that he was [[bankruptcy|bankrupt]]. Instead of abandoning filming altogether, Welles as director began pouring his own money into the project. When he ran out of money as well, he needed to stop filming for months at a time to raise money, mostly by taking part in other productions. Because of lack of funds, production was stopped at least three times. The film found some imaginative solutions to a range of logistical problems; the scene in which Roderigo is murdered in a Turkish bath was shot in that form because the original costumes were impounded and using replacements would have meant a delay. One of the fight scenes starts in Morocco, but the ending was shot in Rome several months later.<ref>Brigitte Tast, Hans-J\u00fcrgen Tast: ''Orson Welles - Othello - Mogador. Aufenthalte in Essaouira'', Kulleraugen Vis.Komm. Nr. 42, Schellerten 2013, {{ISBN|978-3-88842-042-9}}</ref> Welles used the money from his acting roles, such as in ''[[The Third Man]]'' (1949), to help finance the film, but this often involved pausing filming for several months while he went off to raise money; and these pauses were further complicated by the shifting availability of different actors, which meant that some key parts (like Desdemona) had to be recast, and whole scenes then reshot.<ref>[http://www.wellesnet.com/filming_othello.htm Filming ''Othello'']</ref> This lengthy shoot is detailed in [[Miche\u00e1l MacLiamm\u00f3ir]]'s book ''Put Money in Thy Purse.''\n\nWhen Welles acted in the 1950 film ''[[The Black Rose]]'', he insisted that the coat his character, Bayan, wore be lined with mink, even though it would not be visible. Despite the expense, the producers agreed to his request. At the end of filming, the coat disappeared, but could subsequently be seen in ''Othello'' with the fur lining exposed.<ref>Cameraman:The life & work of Jack Cardiff</ref>\n\nWelles was reportedly extremely satisfied with the film's musical score by [[Angelo Francesco Lavagnino]], and Lavagnino again provided the musical scores of Welles' two subsequent Shakespearean films, ''[[Chimes at Midnight]]'' (1965) and ''[[The Merchant of Venice (unfinished film)|The Merchant of Venice]]'' (1969).\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Orson Welles]] as Othello\n*[[Miche\u00e1l Mac Liamm\u00f3ir]] as Iago\n* [[Robert Coote]] as Roderigo\n* [[Suzanne Cloutier]] as Desdemona\n* [[Hilton Edwards]] as Brabantio\n* Nicholas Bruce as Lodovico\n* Michael Laurence as Michael Cassio\n* [[Fay Compton]] as Emilia\n* [[Doris Dowling]] as Bianca\n\n==Release==\n{{more citations needed section|date=January 2016}}\nA dubbed version of ''Othello'' premiered in Rome, Italy on 29 November 1951.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Anile|first1=Alberto|title=Orson Welles in Italy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3cyrAAAAQBAJ&q=othello+italy+premiere+1951&pg=PA245|website=[[Google]]|date=25 September 2013|isbn=9780253010414}}</ref> Welles' original English-language version premiered at the [[Cannes Film Festival]] on 10 May 1952, and went on general release in Europe. Unlike that of the subsequent American cut, the soundtrack was generally without flaws, apart from some dubbing that was slightly out of sync. It features different edits of many scenes from the other two versions, with alternative camera angles used. A print remains stored in the Paris Cinematheque.\n\nWelles supervised a different version of ''Othello'' for the American market, a 93-minute cut released on 12 September 1955 in [[New York City]]. This had a number of minor editing and several major soundtrack changes, including Welles' replacement of his spoken-word titles with written credits (requested by the film's distributor, [[United Artists]]) and the addition of a narration by Welles. [[Suzanne Cloutier]]'s entire performance was dubbed by [[Gudrun Ure]], who had previously played Desdemona opposite Welles in a 1951 theatre production of ''Othello'' that was staged to raise funds to complete the film. Paul Squitieri, in a 1993 PhD study of the film in its various forms, argues that the U.S. version represents a \"compromise\", with some of the changes forced on Welles, and that the original European cut represents the truest version.<ref>Paul Squitieri, \"The twofold corpus of Orson Welles' ''Othello''\", PhD dissertation, University of California, 1993, cited in Michael Anderegg, ''Orson Welles, Shakespeare and Popular Culture'' (Columbia University Press, New York, 1999) p.119</ref> A Criterion [[LaserDisc]] of this version came out in 1994, but was withdrawn from sale after legal action by Welles' daughter, Beatrice Welles.\n\nWelles featured ''Othello'' clips in his 1978 \"making of\" movie, ''[[Filming Othello]]'', but in fact these had all been completely reedited by him for the documentary, and so do not appear in the original film in the same form. The clips were all accompanied by a voice-over from Welles, so that no part of the original soundtrack was heard in ''Filming Othello''.\n\n==Reception==\nReleased in [[Europe]] to acclaim in 1952, ''Othello'' won the ''Grand Prix du Festival International du Film''<ref group=\"note\">The ''Grand Prix du Festival International du Film'' was the original award granted by the Cannes Film Festival during its early years.

The film has a 93% approval rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]], based on 32 reviews with an average rating of 7.9/10. The website's critical consensus states, \"This ragged take on Othello may take liberties with the source material, but Orson Welles's genius never fails to impress.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the-tragedy-of-othello-the-moor-of-venice-othello1952|title=The Tragedy of Othello: The Moor of Venice (Othello) (1955)|work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|publisher=[[Fandango Media]]|access-date=16 May 2015}}</ref>\n\n==1992 restoration==\nIn 1992, Beatrice Welles-Smith, daughter of Orson Welles, supervised a restoration of the film, which saw over $1,000,000 spent on improving the picture quality, resynchronizing the audio, adding extra sound effects, and completely rerecording the music in stereo. Although the restoration was greeted with positive reviews upon its release, it subsequently came under attack for numerous technical flaws and alterations. Further alterations were made between the restoration's theatrical release and its home media release, after complaints that the opening scene lacked the Gregorian chanting it had previously had, and another scene was missing entirely. This is the only version which has been available on VHS and DVD since the mid-1990s, since legal action by Beatrice Welles has blocked either version released by Orson Welles from being sold. This version runs to 91 minutes.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}\n\nMultiple film historians criticized the restoration work. [[Jonathan Rosenbaum]] argued that numerous changes were made against Welles' intent and that the restoration was incompetent, having used as its source an original distribution print with a flawed soundtrack. In fact, the visual elements of the 1992 restoration utilized a fine-grain master positive \u2014 discovered in a storage facility in New Jersey \u2014 as its source, not a distribution print. The audio came from a distribution print that was resynchronized, virtually syllable by syllable, by the restoration team to match the master positive. As some voice parts had music underneath, the newly recorded music and effects track had to match whatever music was underneath the dialogue, leading to inconsistencies. The flaw in the American cut's soundtrack is how [[white noise]] is audible in the background throughout dialogue and music, but that the noise cuts out when there is no action\u2014meaning the white noise is more noticeable whenever it returns. The restoration sought to minimize this problem, but it is still present in places. By contrast, the white noise problem is not present to begin with in Welles' original 1952 European cut.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}\n\nRosenbaum makes several charges of incompetence on the restoration team's part, including that the restoration team were unaware of the European cut's existence, and instead based their work on the American cut which was farther from Welles' original vision. The team recut the order of entire scenes to make the dialogue match. One scene was inexplicably missing from the cinema release, but restored for the video/DVD release. The opening scene, in cinema release, was lacking the important [[Gregorian chanting]], but this was restored for the DVD. The soundtrack attracted particular criticism. Instead of consulting the papers of composer [[Angelo Francesco Lavagnino]], where a full copy of the score survives, the restorers chose to transcribe the music from the poor-quality audio of the print they had, with numerous mistakes having been made \u2014 Lavagnino's son has gone so far as to argue the new score is so different it is no longer his father's work.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} The new score was also recorded with arguably less impressive resources than the original version\u2014although Welles only used a single microphone for a [[monaural]] soundtrack, he had forty mandolins playing in his version, while the new stereo soundtrack used three. Further, Rosenbaum states that by refusing to give permission for her father's version to be shown or released, Beatrice Welles \"effectively made her father\u2019s version of the film (as well as, more indirectly, his final feature, ''[[Filming Othello]]'') illegal, so that she can make more money on her own version\", since she only receives royalties on the version which she restored.<ref name=\"Jonathanrosenbaum.net\">{{cite web|url=http://www.jonathanrosenbaum.net/?p=20202|title=Orson Welles's OTHELLO|work=jonathanrosenbaum.net|access-date=16 May 2015}}</ref> Many of these criticisms have been subsequently echoed by other scholars such as David Impastato<ref>David Impastato, \"Orson Welles's ''Othello'' and the Welles-Smith Restoration: Definitive Version?\", ''Shakespeare Bulletin: A Journal of Performance Criticism and Scholarship'', 10, No. 4, (Fall 1992) pp.38-41</ref> and Michael Anderegg.<ref>Michael Anderegg, ''Orson Welles, Shakespeare and Popular Culture'' (Columbia University Press, New York, 1999) pp.110-20, which contains a detailed analysis (and criticism) of the competence of the restoration.</ref>\n\nAnderegg particularly criticizes the bold claims made by the restorers at the time of the film's 1992 release, including Beatrice Welles' statements \"This is a film that no one has seen\", that it was a \"lost film\", and that it was \"never given a theatrical release\" (all of which are untrue), and he dismisses as hyperbolic the judgment of film restorer Michael Dawson that Welles' original dubbing was like \"Japanese sci-fi.\" Instead, Anderegg argues that ''Othello'' was simply seldom screened.<ref>Michael Anderegg, ''Orson Welles, Shakespeare and Popular Culture'' (Columbia University Press, New York, 1999) pp.111, 122</ref> Jonathan Rosenbaum has defended the out-of-synchronization dubbing of some lines in Welles' original version, pointing out it was typical of European films of the early 1950s, and likening modern attempts to resynchronize it to the proposed colorisation of ''[[Citizen Kane]]''.<ref name=\"Jonathanrosenbaum.net\"/>\n\nIn 2014 Carlotta Films U.S. released a 2K digital restoration of the 1992 version on [[Digital Cinema Package|D.C.P.]]<ref>{{cite press release |url=http://www.carlottafilms-us.com/othello/img/press-release-othello.pdf |publisher=Carlotta Films US |title=A Tragic, Poetic, and Visually Stunning Work from the Director of ''Citizen Kane'' |year=2014 |access-date=2015-06-04}}</ref> This digital version premiered in Dallas at the 2014 [[USA Film Festival]],<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/219190039/2014-USA-Film-Festival-Program#scribd |title=2014 USA Film Festival Program |access-date=2015-06-04}}</ref> and subsequently played in other cities on the art-house circuit.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2014-04-24/entertainment/ct-premier-attraction-othello-20140424_1_orson-welles-othello-iago |work=Chicago Tribune |author=Michael Phillips |title=Orson Welles' 'Othello' a work of complex origin (Review) |date=2014-04-24 |access-date=2015-06-04}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.siskelfilmcenter.org/othello |quote=This new 2K DCP digital edition is based on the 1992 restoration (supervised by Welles's daughter Beatrice Welles-Smith) that greatly improved existing versions\u2019 visual quality and audio clarity (the latter with alterations that drew divided responses from film critics and scholars). |title=Othello (program note) |publisher=Gene Siskel Film Center |year=2014 |access-date=2015-06-04 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140415074136/http://www.siskelfilmcenter.org/othello |archive-date=2014-04-15 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wellesnet.com/national-screening-dates-for-restored-othello/ |publisher=Wellesnet |title=National screening dates for restored 'Othello' |date=2014-05-02 |access-date=2015-06-04}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://thecinematheque.ca/orson-welles-100/othello |title=Othello (program note) |publisher=The Cinematheque |year=2015 |access-date=2015-06-04}}</ref> ''[[The New Yorker]]'' reported that the monaural soundtrack was a great improvement on the previous version of the restoration \u2014 \"much more appropriate for a low-budget, black-and-white 1952 release.\"<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://www.newyorker.com/culture/richard-brody/orson-welless-shattering-othello |title=Orson Welles's Shattering ''Othello'' |last=Brody |first=Richard |author-link=Richard Brody |date=April 25, 2014 |magazine=[[The New Yorker]] |access-date=2016-01-15}}</ref>\n\n==Home media==\nOn September 26, 2017, [[The Criterion Collection]] released both the European and 1955 US versions of ''Othello'' on Blu-ray and DVD.
