Though she is immortal, she is required to drink the blood of a young male virgin three times by Halloween each year to keep her immortality and youthful appearance. She finds this task increasingly and extremely hard, since attractive young male virgins are almost impossible to find in the 1980s, particularly in hedonistic cities, in this case, Los Angeles, California.\n\nMeanwhile, virgin high school student Mark Kendall wants to have sex, but is being put off by his girlfriend Robin Pierce. One night, Mark and his best friends Jamie and Russ go into a singles bar in Hollywood. Mark meets the Countess, goes back to her mansion and after she seduces him, passes out when she bites his thigh. When he wakes up, she pretends they have had sex and tells him that he is now hers. Mark does not know what she means and, over the next few days, begins showing strange behaviors: having strange dreams, avoiding direct sunlight, and even drinking blood (from raw meat). After the Countess gets a second bite, Robin notices Mark's odd behavior and confronts the Countess during a dance-off at the high school's Halloween dance.\n\nWhile it appears that Robin has won back Mark, this is only temporary. The Countess kidnaps Robin to lure Mark to her mansion for a final bite before her deadline expires, and it is up to Robin, Jamie, and Russ to stop her. Eventually, to save Mark from the Countess's clutches, Robin and Mark have sex in a coffin while being chased by the Countess's minions, thereby taking Mark's virginity, bringing him back to normal. This renders him useless to the Countess as she has to drink virgin blood. Defeated, the Countess then begins to grow old and decrepit before their eyes. The Countess's assistant, Sebastian, tells her not to worry as there are other virgins in the world despite the fact that the Countess doubts she will find another virgin. The movie ends with Mark and Robin continuing to have sex in the coffin.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Lauren Hutton]] as the Countess\n* [[Jim Carrey]] as Mark Kendall\n* [[Karen Kopins]] as Robin Pierce\n* [[Cleavon Little]] as Sebastian, the Countess's manservant \n* Thomas Ballatore as Jamie\n* Skip Lackey as Russ\n* [[Richard Schaal]] as Mr. Kendall, Mark's father\n* [[Peggy Pope]] as Mrs. Kendall, Mark's mother\n* [[Megan Mullally]] as Suzette\n\n=== The Countess's Vampires ===\n* Jeb Stuart Adams as World War I Ace Vampire\n* [[Stuart Charno]] as Cabin Boy Vampire\n* Robin Klein as 1960s Flower Child Vampire\n* [[Carey More]] as Moll Flanders Vampire\n* Glen Mauro as Twin Vampire #1\n* Gary Mauro as Twin Vampire #2\n\n==Release==\nThe film was released on November 15, 1985 on 1,095 screens, and opened at number one at the U.S. box office, grossing $4,025,657 for the weekend.<ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|title=B.O.
