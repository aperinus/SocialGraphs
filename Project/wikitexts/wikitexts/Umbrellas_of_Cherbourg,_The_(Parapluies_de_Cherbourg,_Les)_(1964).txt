[[Catherine Deneuve]] and [[Nino Castelnuovo]] star as two young lovers in the French city of [[Cherbourg]], separated by circumstance. The film's dialogue is entirely sung as [[recitative]], including casual conversation, and is [[sung-through]], or [[through-composed]], like some operas and stage musicals.<ref>[https://www.criterion.com/films/27933-the-umbrellas-of-cherbourg The Criterion Collection]</ref> It has been seen as the middle part of an informal \"romantic trilogy\" of Demy films that share some of the same actors, characters, and overall look, coming after ''[[Lola (1961 film)|Lola]]'' (1961) and before ''[[The Young Girls of Rochefort]]'' (1967). The French-language film was a [[Co-production (media)|co-production]] between France and West Germany.<ref>{{Cite web|title=The Umbrellas of Cherbourg (1964)|url=https://www2.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b6b295aa3|access-date=2021-07-13|website=BFI|language=en}}</ref>\n\n''The Umbrellas of Cherbourg'' won the [[Palme d'Or]] at the [[1964 Cannes Film Festival]].

The film's main theme, \"[[I Will Wait for You]]\", was nominated for [[Academy Award for Best Original Song|Best Original Song]]. It was later adapted into an English-language [[Musical theatre|stage musical]].\n\nIn 2018, a [[BBC Culture]] critics' poll ranked the film in the Top 100 Greatest Non-English Films of All Time.<ref>{{Cite web|title=The 100 greatest foreign-language films|url=https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20181029-the-100-greatest-foreign-language-films|access-date=2021-07-14|website=www.bbc.com|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n===Part One: The Departure (November 1957)===\n\nMadame \u00c9mery and her beautiful 17-year-old daughter Genevi\u00e8ve have a tiny, struggling umbrella boutique in the coastal town of [[Cherbourg]] in [[Normandy]]. Guy is a handsome young auto mechanic who lives with and cares for his sickly aunt and [[Godparent|godmother]] \u00c9lise. Though Genevi\u00e8ve's mother disapproves, Guy and Genevi\u00e8ve are deeply in love; they plan to marry and name their first child Fran\u00e7oise. At the same time, Madeleine, a quiet young woman who looks after Guy's aunt, is secretly in love with Guy.\n\nGuy is [[Conscription in France|drafted]] to serve in the [[Algerian War of Independence|Algerian War]]. The night before he leaves, he and Genevi\u00e8ve pledge their undying love and have sex, perhaps for the first time.\n\n===Part Two: The Absence (January\u2013April 1958)===\nGenevi\u00e8ve learns she is pregnant and writes to Guy, but his replies are sporadic. Her mother tells her to give up on Guy{{snd}}he has forgotten her. Genevi\u00e8ve is courted by Roland Cassard, a kind, young, very wealthy Parisian jeweler; he wants to marry her despite her pregnancy. In one of the connections among Demy's trilogy of films, Roland had previously unsuccessfully wooed the title character in the earlier ''[[Lola (1961 film)|Lola]]'' (1961); now he relates a version of this story to Madame \u00c9mery. Madame \u00c9mery urges Genevi\u00e8ve to be sensible and choose a secure future with Roland. Roland announces that he will be going to Amsterdam for three months, and will wait for Genevi\u00e8ve's answer until his return. Genevi\u00e8ve marries Roland in [[:fr:Basilique Sainte-Trinit\u00e9 de Cherbourg|a great cathedral]], but she appears ambivalent about her decision.\n\n===Part Three: The Return (March 1959{{snd}}December 1963)===\nReturning injured from the war, Guy learns that Genevi\u00e8ve has married and left Cherbourg. He has a difficult time readjusting to civilian life. After an argument with his boss he quits his job, goes drinking in a seedy bar, and spends the night with a prostitute. When he returns to his apartment, Madeleine tells him that his aunt \u00c9lise has died.\n\nGuy sees that Madeleine loves him, and he rebuilds his life with her help. Using the inheritance from his aunt he opens a new \"American-style\" gas station. Madeleine agrees to marry him, though she wonders whether he is merely on the rebound after losing Genevi\u00e8ve.\n\nFour years later, on a snowy Christmas Eve, Guy and Madeleine are in the office of their gas station with their small son Fran\u00e7ois. Madeleine is decorating a Christmas tree. They appear a loving, happy family. As Madeleine and Fran\u00e7ois leave to visit [[Santa Claus]], an expensive car pulls in. The mink-clad driver is Genevi\u00e8ve, now wealthy and sophisticated. She has a young girl with her. As Guy rounds the car to Genevi\u00e8ve's window their eyes meet and there is a moment of awkwardness.\n\nGuy invites Genevi\u00e8ve into the warmth of the station's office, where they chat as a boy attends to Genevi\u00e8ve's car. This is Genevi\u00e8ve's first time in Cherbourg since her marriage, she tells him; her mother died recently. Looking outside at the girl in the car, Guy asks, \"What did you name her?\" Genevi\u00e8ve answers, \"Fran\u00e7oise. She's a lot like you. Do you want to see her?\" Guy shakes his head.\n\nThe car is ready. At the door Genevi\u00e8ve pauses and asks, \"Are you doing well?\" Guy replies, \"Yes, very well.\" She opens the door and pulls her collar tight against the cold before looking back at Guy one last time. She walks to her car, gets in, and drives off. Madeleine returns with Fran\u00e7ois, and Guy greets her with a kiss. As the camera pulls back, he frolics with his son in the snow, then picks him up and follows Madeleine inside.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Catherine Deneuve]] as Genevi\u00e8ve \u00c9mery\n* [[Nino Castelnuovo]] as Guy Foucher\n* [[Anne Vernon]] as Madame \u00c9mery\n* [[Marc Michel]] as Roland Cassard\n* {{ill|Ellen Farner|de}} as Madeleine\n* [[Mireille Perrey]] as Aunt \u00c9lise\n* [[Harald Wolff]] as M.

It was nominated for several [[Academy Awards]], including for Best Foreign Film, Best Song, Best Soundtrack, and Best Original Screenplay. It won three awards at the [[1964 Cannes Film Festival]], including its top prize, the [[Palme d'Or]]. Jim Ridley has called ''Cherbourg'' \"the most affecting of movie musicals, and perhaps the fullest expression of [Demy's] career-long fascination with the entwining of real life, chance, and the bewitching artifice of cinematic illusion.\"\n\n==Music==\nThe continuous music score and the brightly coloured photography had much to do with the popularity of this film. Formally the work is operatic, with the plot advanced entirely through dialogue sung with accompanying music. The colour photography is bright and vivid. The whole is united by an orchestral score of simple rhythms and tunes that are integrated with the story covering five years.\n\nSince the cast were not trained singers, most of the actors' voices were dubbed and [[Lip sync|lipsynced]]:<ref name=\"Erickson\">{{cite web |url=http://www.dvdtalk.com/dvdsavant/s1168para.html |title=DVD Savant Review: The Umbrellas of Cherbourg |access-date=2007-12-09 |last=Erickson |first=Glenn |author-link=Glenn Erickson |date=2004-04-03 |publisher=dvdtalk.com }}</ref>\n{{columns-list|colwidth=20em|\n* [[Danielle Licari]]: Genevi\u00e8ve \u00c9mery\n* Jos\u00e9 Bartel: Guy Foucher\n* [[Christiane Legrand]]: Madame \u00c9mery\n* Georges Blaness: Roland Cassard\n* Claudine Meunier: Madeleine\n* Claire Leclerc: Aunt \u00c9lise\n* Michel Legrand: Jean}}\n\nThe film score established composer [[Michel Legrand]]'s reputation in Hollywood.

The various copies of the film used in the cinema circuit gradually lost their quality. ''Umbrellas'' thus could not be seen with the rich colours which Demy had originally intended.\n\nKnowing as he did that the Eastman stock would fade over time, Demy had made the three main yellow, cyan and magenta color [[separation masters]] on black-and-white negative films, which do not fade. These black-and-white separations had greater longevity.{{Efn|This process is not unique to this title, but it may be unique within French Eastmancolor-originated films. In the United States, separation masters are made, and have been made for nearly every Eastmancolor-originated title since about 1952. Additionally, so-called \"low-fade\" film is now used for making prints.}}\n\nIn the 1990s, Demy's wife, film director [[Agn\u00e8s Varda]], headed a project to create a new colour-negative film from the three black and white separations. Restored full-color prints were made from this in 2004. The resulting film recaptured Demy's vision of a fantastically colourful Cherbourg.\n\nComposer Michel Legrand assisted in restoring the original four-track stereo sound masters to digital. He remastered his score to produce a higher-quality version, released in 2014.\n\nA digital version of the film was released on Blu-ray by Cin\u00e9 Tamaris in 2013, on the 50th anniversary of its original release. This version was restored independently of the 2004 version with colour grading supervised by Demy's son [[Mathieu Demy]].<ref>[https://www.criterion.com/current/posts/3232-restoring-the-umbrellas-of-cherbourg Restoring The Umbrellas of Cherbourg|The Current|The Criterion Collection]</ref>\n\n==''Les Bicyclettes de Belsize''==\n{{Main|Les Bicyclettes de Belsize}}\nThe title of the film inspired a musical short subject, released in 1969 and titled ''[[Les Bicyclettes de Belsize]],'' which essentially parodied it.
