The screenplay by [[Armistead Maupin]], Terry Anderson, and Stettner is based on Maupin's 2000 novel ''[[The Night Listener (novel)|The Night Listener]]'', which was inspired by [[Anthony Godby Johnson]].\n\n==Plot==\nGabriel Noone, a popular [[gay]] [[New York City]] radio show host, is dealing with a separation from his partner, Jess. Noone is given a [[memoir]] written by teenager Pete Logand, which chronicles the many years of [[child sexual abuse|sexual abuse]] he suffered at the hands of his parents and their friends. Diagnosed with [[AIDS]], the youth has been adopted by Donna Logand, the [[social worker]] who handled his case.\n\nNoone begins a telephone relationship with the boy and Donna. He and Pete become increasingly close and form a father-son relationship, much to the dismay of Jess, especially after he speaks to Donna and suspects that she was impersonating Pete in some of the telephone conversations. Noone's personal secretary Anna adds fuel to the fire by discussing her research into people who fabricate elaborate stories to get attention. Determined to prove the boy exists and his story is true, Noone decides to pay a surprise visit to Pete in his hometown in rural [[Wisconsin]]. Noone discovers the return address on Pete's correspondence is actually a [[Commercial mail receiving agency|mail drop]]. Soon after, while eating in a local diner, he overhears another patron and recognizes her voice as that of Donna. He is stunned to learn that she is blind and uses a [[guide dog]]. Noone follows her home and Donna senses he has followed her. She invites him into her home and talks openly about Pete, who she says is currently in the hospital undergoing tests. She assures him he can visit the boy the following day, then suddenly becomes angry and tells him she will not allow him to meet Pete. Increasingly suspicious, Noone contacts all the hospitals in [[Madison, Wisconsin|Madison]], the location of the nearest facilities, but none have the boy registered as a patient.\n\nNoone's paranoia about the boy's existence grows and, hoping to find proof of his existence, he breaks into Donna's home. A [[police officer]] arrests him for [[breaking and entering]] and then, mistakenly believing Noone to be one of the boy's abusers, attacks him with a [[Electroshock weapon|stun baton]] before taking him to the station. Noone convinces the police he meant no harm and is released, only to find Donna waiting for him with the news that Pete is dead; also, that he was in a Milwaukee hospital, and was never in Madison. Distressed that Noone doesn't believe her, Donna collapses in the middle of a road and tries to hold him with her in the path of an oncoming truck. She then moves everything out of her home and disappears before the police can question her. Noone is now convinced that the boy is a figment of the deranged woman's imagination.\n\nIn response to a phone call from Donna, Noone goes to a motel where she was staying, and finds Pete's stuffed rabbit and a videotape under a blanket. He plays the video of a child, who seems to be Pete, but who could have been anyone. The phone rings and the caller claims to be the boy (but sounds exactly like Donna now), waiting for his mother at the airport. The caller ends the conversation after Noone asks what happened in Donna's past and how she became blind and that Donna should get help. Noone just watches the video, deep in thought.\n\nNoone returns to [[Manhattan]] and uses his experience to create ''The Night Listener'', a new radio story. In the final scene, Donna is searching for a new home in a coastal town, telling the realtor she needs it for herself and her son, who has just lost his leg but will be released the next day. She has drastically changed her appearance and no longer has a guide dog or dark glasses, revealing her blindness was also an act. Gabriel concludes his show for the night by saying, \"As for Pete, there's a line in the Velveteen Rabbit that reads... Real isn't how you were made. It's the thing that happens to you. I'm Gabriel Noone. Goodnight\".\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Robin Williams]] as Gabriel Noone\n* [[Toni Collette]] as Donna Logand\n* [[Rory Culkin]] as Pete D.

In 1992, the author was sent the manuscript of a memoir allegedly written by fourteen-year-old [[Anthony Godby Johnson]], who had been sexually and physically abused by his parents since childhood. Since the [[Galley proof|galleys]] included a foreword by [[novelist]] [[Paul Monette]], a close friend of Maupin, and an afterword by [[Fred Rogers]] of ''[[Mister Rogers' Neighborhood]]'' fame, he had no reason to doubt the story's veracity.\n\nMaupin was impressed with the maturity of the boy's writing and called him. The two quickly developed a close telephone relationship, and Maupin frequently discussed the boy's various physical ailments (he had been diagnosed with AIDS) with his adopted mother, Vicki Johnson. Several months later, Maupin's then-lover Terry Anderson (who co-wrote the screenplay), who had spoken to the boy on occasion, had a conversation with his mother and was struck by how much she and the boy sounded alike. As he became increasingly suspicious about the situation, Maupin became more and more determined to believe the boy really existed. Only after Vicki repeatedly prevented him from visiting the boy did Maupin begin to think he was caught up in a scam.\n\nFollowing the publication of the novel, a friend of Maupin's who wrote for ''[[The New Yorker]]'' instigated an investigation. The story was reported by ''[[20/20 (American TV program)|20/20]]'', which revealed that the photo of \"Anthony\" that Vicki had sent to Anthony's supporters was a childhood photo of Steve Tarabokija, now a healthy adult and a New Jersey traffic engineer, who was shocked to find his photo being represented to people as the face of Anthony Godby Johnson.\n\n==Release==\n\n===Box office===\nThe [[film premiere]]d at the [[Sundance Film Festival]] and was shown at the [[Berlin International Film Festival]] before opening on 1,367 screens in the US, earning $3,554,134 in its opening weekend.
