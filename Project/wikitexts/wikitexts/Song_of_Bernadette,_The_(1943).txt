It stars [[Jennifer Jones]] in the title role, which portrays the story of [[Bernadette Soubirous]], who reportedly experienced [[Lourdes apparitions|eighteen visions]] of the [[Blessed Virgin Mary]] from February to July 1858 and was later [[Canonization|canonized]] in 1933. The film was directed by [[Henry King (director)|Henry King]], from a [[screenplay]] written by [[George Seaton]].\n\nThe novel was extremely popular, spending more than a year on [[The New York Times Best Seller list|''The New York Times'' Best Seller list]] and thirteen weeks heading the list. The story was also turned into a Broadway play, which opened at the [[Belasco Theatre]] in March 1946.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://ibdb.com/production.php?id=1781| title=The Song of Bernadette| publisher=[[Internet Broadway Database]]| access-date=5 September 2017}}</ref>\n\n== Plot ==\nIt is February 11, 1858. Fourteen-year-old [[Bernadette Soubirous]] lives in poverty with her family in [[Lourdes]]. At her [[Catholic school]], [[Marie Therese Vauzou|Sister Vauzou]] shames Bernadette for falling behind in her studies because of her [[asthma]].\n\nLater that afternoon, while fetching firewood with her sister Marie and friend Jeanne, Bernadette is left behind in the [[Sanctuary of Our Lady of Lourdes#History|Massabielle grotto]]. Distracted by a strange breeze and a change in the light, Bernadette investigates and sees a beautiful lady. They pray the [[rosary]] together. Her friends  promise to keep what they saw a secret, but Marie tells their mother when they return home. Neighbor Croisine and her husband appear with food to share their gratitude for Bernadette's mother Louise caring for their sick baby and for Soubirous' new job.\n\nWhen the story spreads all over Lourdes, Bernadette's aunt Bernarde tells Bernadette's parents to stand up for their daughter and go with her to the grotto. Others follow. \u201cAll France will be laughing at us,\u201d  the mayor says to the Imperial Prosecutor.  [[Abb\u00e9]] [[Dominique Peyramale]] refuses to get involved. Bernadette faces threatening interrogation by Dutour and Jacomet, but confounds them with her simplicity.\n\nBernadette brings a message for the dean: Chapels are to be built, and processions are to come to Massabielle. He asks the lady for a \u201clittle miracle\u201d: Make the wild rosebush bloom, in February. No roses appear, but the lady tells Bernadette to wash at a nonexistent spring. Bernadette digs a hole in the ground and smears her face. The crowd disperses, but Antoine and Bouriette call them back; water pours from the hole.\n\nCroisine's child dies. She runs with him to the spring, saying \u201cTake him Lord or give him back to me.\u201d The baby cries\u2014and moves. Dr. Dozous cannot explain the undeniable physical transformation. Suffering people flock to Lourdes.\n\nOn Bernadette\u2019s last visit to the grotto, the lady finally identifies herself as \"[[Immaculate Conception|The Immaculate Conception]].\" Bernadette does not understand. Others are stunned. Peyramale warns her that she is playing with fire.\n\nThe grotto is fenced off, ostensibly to test the water. Dutour tries to have Bernadette committed, but Peyramale declares it will be \u201cover his dead body.\u201d He takes her to the convent, where Sister Vauzou accuses her of deception.\n\nPeyramale asks the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Tarbes-et-Lourdes|Bishop of Tarbes]] for an episcopal commission to decide if Bernadette is a fraud, insane, or \u201cthe rarest of mortal beings.\u201d The Bishop declares that unless [[Napoleon III|the Emperor]] orders the grotto to be opened, there will be no investigation. When the Emperor\u2019s [[Louis Napol\u00e9on, Prince Imperial|infant son]] is cured of a cold by water from Lourdes, [[Eug\u00e9nie de Montijo|the Empress]] demands the grotto be reopened.\n\nFour years later, Peyramale persuades Bernadadette to join the [[Sisters of Charity of Nevers]]. As novice Marie Bernarde, she works hard at the convent, where Sister Vauzou is mistress of novices. Years later, Vauzou accuses Sister Marie Bernarde of limping to get attention. Vauzou reveals that she is consumed by doubt. She cannot believe that someone who has never suffered would be chosen when she has spent her life suffering in God's service. Bernadette agrees that she has not suffered, then pauses and raises the skirt of her habit.  Vauzou is horrified at the vast tumor revealed (not shown). The doctor diagnoses  [[tuberculosis]] of the bone; the condition causes unspeakable pain, yet Bernadette never mentioned it. Vauzou prays for forgiveness and vows to serve Bernadette for the rest of her life.\n\nDespite the severity of her illness, Bernadette insists that \u201cthe spring is not for me.\u201d  The bishop wants one final confirmation from her lips. \u201cI did see her,\u201d she cries.\n\nIn Lourdes, Dutour, dying of throat cancer, walks with thousands of pilgrims to the [[Sanctuary of Our Lady of Lourdes|shrine]] and kneels, saying, \u201cPray for me, Bernadette.\u201d\n\nBernadette sends for Peyramale. Her voice failing, she confesses she is afraid that she has not suffered enough. She calls to the lady, afraid that she will never see her again. The lady appears, smiling, her arms open. Bernadette whispers, \u201cI love you, I love you. Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for me,\u201d and dies. \"You are now in Heaven and on Earth. Your life begins, O Bernadette,\u201d Peyramale says.  Bells are heard, and the film ends with a clip of the interior of what appears to be [[St. Peter's Basilica]].<ref>[[St. Peter's Baldachin|Bernini's Baldachin]] visible on the left side of the screen. Bernadette was canonized in 1933, so it is possible that this is footage taken at the time.</ref>\n\n==Cast==\n[[Image:Jennifer Jones still, 'Song of Bernadette'.jpg|right|200px|thumb|Jones as Bernadette Soubirous in ''The Song of Bernadette'' (1943)]]\n* [[Jennifer Jones]] as [[Bernadette Soubirous]]\n* [[Charles Bickford]] as [[Abb\u00e9]] [[Dominique Peyramale]]\n* [[William Eythe]] as Antoine Nicoleau\n* [[Gladys Cooper]] as [[Marie Therese Vauzou]], Bernadette's schoolteacher and later the Mistress of Novices\n* [[Vincent Price]] as Vital Dutour,  Imperial Prosecutor\n* [[Lee J.

Bernadette's real-life friend Antoine Nicolau is portrayed as being deeply in love with her and vowing to remain unmarried when Bernadette enters the convent.  No such relationship is documented as existing between them. In addition, the government authorities, in particular, Imperial Prosecutor Vital Dutour (played by [[Vincent Price]]) are portrayed as being much more anti-religion than they actually were;<ref>{{cite book| last=Trochu| first=Fran\u00e7ois| title=Saint Bernadette Soubirous: 1844-1879| publisher=Tan Books| date=1 January 1957| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8VZODQAAQBAJ&q=Saint+Bernadette+Soubirous| isbn=978-1787201194}} Trochu provides background information on Bernadette's \"inquisitors\", revealing that they were not atheists or even freethinkers.</ref> in fact, Dutour was himself a devout [[Catholic]] who simply thought Bernadette was hallucinating. Other portrayals come closer to historical accuracy, particularly [[Anne Revere]] and [[Roman Bohnen]] as Bernadette's overworked parents, [[Charles Bickford]] as [[Dominique Peyramale|Father Peyramale]]  (although his presence at Bernadette's deathbed was an artistic embellishment; in reality, Peyramale had died a few years before Bernadette), and [[Blanche Yurka]] as formidable Aunt Bernarde.\n\nThe portrayal of Sister [[Marie Therese Vauzou]] is also inaccurate.  There is no evidence that Sister Vazou was Bernadette\u2019s elementary school teacher or that they met prior to the time that Bernanette entered the convent.  The dramatic conversion of Sister Vazou to Bernadette\u2019s cause, depicted in the movie, is unsupported by the historical record.  Indeed, more than 20 years after Bernadette\u2019s death, Sister Vazou testified that Bernadette was vain and simple and should not be canonized.<ref>Aquer\u00f2 - The Atlantic (December 2002).</ref>\n\nThe film combines the characters of Vital Dutour and the man of letters Hyacinthe de La Fite, who appears in the novel and believes he has cancer of the larynx. La Fite does not appear at all in the movie. In the film, it is Dutour who is dying of cancer of the larynx at the end, and who goes to the Lourdes shrine, kneels at the gates to the grotto and says, \"Pray for me, Bernadette.\"\n\nThe film ends with the death of Bernadette and does not mention the exhumation of her body or her [[canonization]], as the novel does.\n\n==Music==\n[[Igor Stravinsky]] was initially informally approached to write the film score.  On 15 February 1943, he started writing music for the \"Apparition of the Virgin\" scene.  However, the studio never approved a contract with Stravinsky, and the project went to [[Alfred Newman (composer)|Alfred Newman]], who won an Oscar.  The music Stravinsky had written for the film made its way into the second movement of his [[Symphony in Three Movements (Stravinsky)|Symphony in Three Movements]].<ref>{{cite book| first=Stephen| last=Walsh| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-TwBsckJEKsC&pg=PA143| title=Stravinsky: The Second Exile: France and America 1934-1971| page=144| date=30 September 2011| access-date=5 September 2014| isbn=978-1407064482}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n[[Bosley Crowther]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' gave the movie a mostly negative review, praising the acting, especially Jones's, but regretting the movie's \"tedious and repetitious\" narrative, its emphasis on \"images that lack visual mobility\" and \"dialectic discourse that will clutter and fatigue the average mind,\" and the decision to make Bernadette's \"lady\" visible to viewers.<ref name=\"Crowther\">{{cite news|last=Crowther|first=Bosley|title=THE SCREEN; 'The Song of Bernadette,' a Devout Film Version of the Werfel Story, With Jennifer Jones, Opens Here at Rivoli|date=January 27, 1944|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1944/01/27/archives/the-screen-the-song-of-bernadette-a-devout-film-version-of-the.html|work=[[The New York Times]]|access-date=26 December 2021}}</ref>\n\n{{RT prose|88|6.8|16}}<ref>{{cite Rotten Tomatoes|title=Mortal Kombat (2021)|id=song_of_bernadette |type=m|access-date=May 2, 2021}}</ref>\n\n==Awards and nominations==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
