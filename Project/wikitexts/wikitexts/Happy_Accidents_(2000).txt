The film was shot almost entirely in Brooklyn, New York.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Happy Accidents Film Locations - [otsoNY.com] |url=http://onthesetofnewyork.com/happyaccidents.html |access-date=2022-10-14 |website=onthesetofnewyork.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |last=Chamberlain |first=Frances |date=2000-02-27 |title=Looking for 'Connecticut' in the Credits |language=en-US |work=The New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/02/27/nyregion/looking-for-connecticut-in-the-credits.html |access-date=2022-10-14 |issn=0362-4331}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nRuby Weaver is weary of her long history of failed relationships with men when she meets Sam Deed in a park. But after the two fall in love, Ruby becomes suspicious of Sam's past, his obsession with a \"Chrystie Delancey\", and \"causal effect\". Under pressure from her, he finally explains that he is really from the year 2470 and is what he calls a \"back traveler\". Ruby initially ignores this story, but after Sam's persistence, she begins to wonder. She takes him to see her therapist Meg Ford. Ruby becomes worried as to Sam's sanity when he reveals that everything he has done was a deliberate attempt to change her life. In the end, both Deed ''and'' Ford turn out to be time travelers and the fatal accident that would have killed Ruby is avoided.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n*[[Marisa Tomei]] as Ruby Weaver\n*[[Vincent D'Onofrio]] as Sam Deed\n*[[Nadia Dajani]] as Gretchen\n*[[Holland Taylor]] as Maggie Ann \"Meg\" Ford\n*[[Jos\u00e9 Z\u00fa\u00f1iga]] as Jose\n*[[Richard Portnow]] as Trip\n*[[Sean Gullette]] as Mark\n*[[Tamara Jenkins]] as Robin\n*[[Sam Seder]] as Ned\n*[[Tovah Feldshuh]] as Lillian Weaver\n*[[Anthony Michael Hall]] as Himself\n*[[Larry Fessenden]] as Junkie\n*[[Michael McGlone]] as Tab}}\n\n==Reception==\n''Happy Accidents'' was first shown at the [[Sundance Film Festival]] on January 25, 2000.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://variety.com/2000/film/reviews/happy-accidents-1200460798/|last=McCarthy|first=Todd|authorlink=Todd McCarthy|title=Happy Accidents|date=February 1, 2000|magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Allen |first=Jamie |date=January 27, 2000 |title=Tomei, D'Onofrio create their own 'Happy Accidents' |url=https://www.cnn.com/2000/SHOWBIZ/Movies/01/26/sundance.weds/index.html |access-date=2022-10-14 |website=CNN}}</ref>The film later opened in limited release on August 24, 2001 to 2 screens in [[New York City, New York]] earning $14,840 on its opening weekend, and (the weekend before [[September 11 attacks|9/11]]) reaching a widest release of 49 screens and grossing a total of $688,523 domestically in the United States.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/release/rl123110913/weekend/|title=''Happy Accidents''|website=[[Box Office Mojo]]|publisher=[[IMDb]]|accessdate=August 25, 2021}}</ref>\n\nOn [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film has a 71% approval rating, based on 62 reviews with an average rating of 6.36/10.
