Night Shyamalan]], who produced with [[Sam Mercer]]. The film features the starring cast of [[Paul Giamatti]], [[Bryce Dallas Howard]], [[Bob Balaban]], [[Jeffrey Wright (actor)|Jeffrey Wright]], [[Sarita Choudhury]], [[Freddy Rodriguez (actor)|Freddy Rodriguez]], [[Bill Irwin]] and [[Jared Harris]]. Produced by [[Legendary Pictures]] and [[Blinding Edge Pictures]] and distributed by [[Warner Bros. Pictures]], the film's plot concerns the superintendent of a Philadelphia apartment complex who discovers a young woman in the swimming pool. Gradually, he and his neighbors learn that she is a [[water nymph]] (or Narf) whose life is in danger from a vicious, wolf-like, mystical creature called a Scrunt that tries to keep her from returning to her watery \"blue world.\" ''Lady in the Water'' was released on July 21, 2006. It is Shyamalan's first film not distributed by [[Walt Disney Studios (division)|Walt Disney Studios]] under their [[Touchstone Pictures]] and [[Hollywood Pictures]] labels since ''[[Wide Awake (1998 film)|Wide Awake]]''.\n\nThe film was critically panned, with criticism revolving around the self-indulgence with which Shyamalan cast himself in the film, the lack of consistency, and the film's characterization. The film was also a [[Box-office bomb|financial failure]] grossing $72 million against a $70 million production budget. At the [[27th Golden Raspberry Awards]], ''Lady in the Water'' received four nominations for [[Worst Picture]] and [[Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Screenplay|Worst Screenplay]], and won two for [[Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Director|Worst Director]], and [[Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Supporting Actor|Worst Supporting Actor]] for Shyamalan.\n\n==Plot==\nOne evening, Cleveland Heep, who became the superintendent of a [[Philadelphia]] apartment complex after his family was murdered, discovers Story, a Narf (a [[naiad]]-like being) from the Blue World, in his building's pool, immediately rescuing her from an attack by a Scrunt, a grass-covered, wolf-like creature that hides by flattening its body against the turf.\n\nStory explains she has arrived to find the Writer, the \"vessel\" who will be magically awakened when he meets her, and then write a book that will save humanity in the future. When Heep mentions the word \"Narf\" to tenant Young-Soon, she recognizes it from stories told by her mother, Mrs.&nbsp;Choi, then summarizes the stories for him.\n\nAfter questioning residents Farber, Bell, Dury, and five nameless smokers, Heep discovers the Writer is tenant Vick Ran, who is struggling to complete ''The Cookbook''. Heep brings Vick to Story; their meeting eliminates his fear and sharpens his [[Internal monologue|inner voice]]. She later explains that ''The Cookbook'' will contain views and ideas so significant they will inspire a future [[President of the United States|President]], a great [[Midwestern United States|Midwestern]] [[public speaking|orator]], to greatly change the world for the better. Vick later deduces, and Story confirms, that he will be killed because of the controversial nature of his ideas.\n\nAs Mrs.&nbsp;Choi remembers more details of the Narf legend, Heep better understands the situation. The Tartutic, an invincible [[simian]]-like quartet<!--- dialogue says there are 3, but 4 are later shown, and included in the closing credits ---> that serve as the Blue World's [[Peacekeeping#Nature of peacekeeping|peacekeeping force]], have forbidden any attack on Story while she travels home. Nonetheless, the Scrunt does just that because they know that Story is destined to be a great Narf leader, the once in a generation Madam Narf who will let all of humanity know they are on the right path.\n\nFor Story to recover from her wounds and return safely, she foresees that she will need the help of a Guardian, a Symbolist, a Guild, and a Healer. Story believes Heep to be her Guardian; Heep asks Farber, an abrasive [[Film criticism|film critic]], to help him figure out the others' identities. Working off movie [[Trope (literature)|tropes]], Farber misadvises Heep, leading him to a flawed conclusion that a resident named Dury is the Symbolist, the smokers are the Guild, and a kindly woman named Bell is the Healer.\n\nHeep confronts the Scrunt, but nearly dies in the process, convincing him he is not the Guardian. The next night, Farber's bad advice leads to their plan's immediate failure. In the confusion, Farber is killed and Story is mortally wounded by the Scrunt. Dury suddenly realizes his son Joey is the real Symbolist. Interpreting the information on cereal boxes, Joey deduces the true Guild is composed of [[7 (number)#In religion|seven]] sisters, that two new men must be present, and that the Healer is a man, soon revealed to be Heep. Heep goes about healing Story by bringing forth his repressed grief: Story's wounds heal when he confesses to her that he does not want to lose her too.\n\nStory again prepares to depart, but the Scrunt attacks. It is stopped by the gaze of Reggie, a lopsidedly muscled tenant who clearly is the Guardian. Reggie's intense stare and stalking approach intimidate the Scrunt into a slow retreat, but Reggie is distracted by the cry of the giant eagle arriving to transport Story back to the Blue World. When Reggie momentarily breaks eye contact, the Scrunt leaps, but the concealed Tartutic leap out of hiding, grab it, and drag it away.\n\nStory hugs Heep goodbye; he thanks her for saving his life. The eagle lands, enfolds Story in one of its wings, and as the residents gaze on, it carries Story up into the night sky.\n\n==Cast==\n<!--- Cast and order per tombstone closing credits, plus 3 named in plot synopsis, roles per closing credits scroll --->\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Paul Giamatti]] as Cleveland Heep\n* [[Bryce Dallas Howard]] as Story\n* [[Bob Balaban]] as Harry Farber\n* [[Jeffrey Wright]] as Mr. Dury\n* [[Sarita Choudhury]] as Anna Ran\n* [[Cindy Cheung (actress)|Cindy Cheung]] as Young-Soon Choi \n* [[Freddy Rodriguez (actor)|Freddy Rodriguez]] as Reggie\n* [[Bill Irwin]] as Mr. Leeds\n* [[Jared Harris]] as Goatee Smoker\n* [[Mary Beth Hurt]] as Mrs. Bell\n* [[Joseph D.

It was Shyamalan's lowest opening for any of his five major films. As a result of the negative reviews and poor word-of-mouth, its second week fell sharply to $7.1 million, pushing its total to only $32.2 million. Its third weekend was no better, falling another 62.1% to $2.7 million. As of 2011, its total was $42.285 million. In addition, the film made only $30.5 million in other territories, bringing its tally to approximately $72.785 million internationally.<ref name=\"mojo\" />\n\n===Critical reaction===\n''Lady in the Water'' was panned around the time of its release.

Many reviewers attacked this perceived self-indulgence: [[Manohla Dargis]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote of the story, \"Apparently those who live in the water now roam the earth trying to make us listen, though initially it's rather foggy as to what precisely we are supposed to hear\u2014the crash of the waves, the songs of the sirens, the voice of God\u2014until we realize that of course we're meant to cup our ear to an even higher power: Mr. Shyamalan.\"<ref>''The New York Times'' (July 2006) [http://movies2.nytimes.com/2006/07/21/movies/21wate.html?8dpc \"Finding Magic Somewhere Under the Pool in ''Lady in the Water''\"] by Manohla Dargis</ref> Of Shyamalan's role in the film, [[Mark Kermode]] said, \"It's like someone pouring petrol over their heads and setting fire to themselves.\"<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio/aod/fivelive_aod.shtml?fivelive/kermode110806 BBC &ndash; Five Live MARK KERMODE]</ref>\n\n[[Frank Lovece]] of ''Film Journal International'' said, \"Fans of actor Paul Giamatti or of filmmaker M.
