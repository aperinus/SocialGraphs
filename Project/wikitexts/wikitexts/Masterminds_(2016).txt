Directed by [[Jared and Jerusha Hess|Jared Hess]] and written by Chris Bowman, [[Hubbel Palmer]] and [[Emily Spivey]], the film stars [[Zach Galifianakis]], [[Owen Wilson]], [[Kristen Wiig]], [[Kate McKinnon]], [[Leslie Jones (comedian)|Leslie Jones]] and [[Jason Sudeikis]].\n\nIt premiered in [[Los Angeles]] on September 26, 2016 and was theatrically released in the United States on September 30, 2016, by Relativity [[EuropaCorp]] Distribution and [[Relativity Media]]. The film received mixed reviews from critics and grossed $30 million.\n\n==Plot==\nIn March 1997, after [[Loomis (company)|Loomis Fargo & Company]] has been robbed of $18.8 million in [[Jacksonville, North Carolina|Jacksonville]] by company security guard [[March 1997 Loomis Fargo robbery|Philip Noel Johnson]], Steve Eugene Chambers and Kelly Campbell, a former employee of Loomis, decides to rob the company. They involve Loomis [[armored car (valuables)|armored car]] driver David Scott Ghantt. After some awkward training in preparation for the robbery, the team has David go inside Loomis' vault and load the entire money supply into the company's van. Before he leaves, David takes out three [[CCTV]] tapes, but misses one. The next day, David flees to Mexico with $20,000 and takes the cover name \"Michael McKinney\", which is the name of a friend of Steve's. Meanwhile, Steve takes most of the heist, around $17 million.\n\n[[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] Special Agent Scanlon and her partner take the case, and immediately have David as the [[prime suspect]], but have no idea of Steve's involvement. Steve plans to cut David loose but Kelly thinks it would be wrong to abandon him. In Mexico, David narrowly evades three [[Interpol]] agents looking for him, and calls Kelly about what happened. Unfortunately, he inadvertently learns Steve's name from the ID in a wallet that Kelly gave to him. With his cover blown, Steve hires the real, but unstable hitman, Michael McKinney to hunt David down. He finds David and attempts to shoot him, but the gun backfires and David escapes. David phones Kelly and learns that Steve is trying to kill him, and that Steve will not send the money for him as expected. David is then knocked unconscious by McKinney. When David regains consciousness, McKinney is about to kill him but reconsiders upon looking at \"McKinney\"'s birth certificate, thinking that David was born under the same circumstances; they become friends.\n\nDavid calls Steve, threatening to surrender himself to Interpol if Steve does not wire $6 million into his bank account in two days. Kelly is then attacked by Jandice, who learns of her involvement with David, at the mall and escapes. When Steve refuses to wire the money, his two friends kidnap Kelly and he tells David to get a ticket to South America in exchange for her release. At the airport, he meets McKinney, who is returning to the U.S., but as he bids farewell he sees Kelly's name written on his hand and tells McKinney that he knows her. Realizing that he cannot bring himself to kill her, they switch tickets just as the three Interpol agents attempt to catch David.\n\nWhile Steve is hosting a party, the FBI puts a wire on one of the party members in an attempt to record Steve's confession. David sneaks in and rescues Kelly. They escape by stealing Steve's [[BMW]] but it crashes as they attempt to drive through the gate. Steve catches and assaults him, until David realizes he is near the FBI van with the agents inside. David tricks Steve into admitting that he was the mastermind of the whole plan, giving the agents enough reason to arrest all of them, including Kelly. David is sentenced to seven years in prison, while Steve served eleven years. About $2 million is still unaccounted for. Upon David's release, he is picked up by McKinney and they drive to visit Kelly.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Zach Galifianakis]]<ref name=\"hollywoodreporter1\"/> as [[David Scott Ghantt]]\n* [[Kristen Wiig]]<ref name=\"hollywoodreporter1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/kristen-wiig-joins-zach-galifianakis-704933 |title=Kristen Wiig Joins Zach Galifianakis, Owen Wilson in Relativity Comedy (Exclusive) |publisher=Hollywoodreporter.com |date=2014-05-16 |access-date=2014-07-11}}</ref> as Kelly Campbell\n* [[Owen Wilson]]<ref name=\"hollywoodreporter1\"/> as Steven Eugene \"Steve\" Chambers\n* [[Jason Sudeikis]]<ref name=\"deadline1\">{{cite web|last=Fleming |first=Mike |url=https://www.deadline.com/2014/06/jason-sudeikis-to-play-hit-man-in-loomis-fargo/ |title=Jason Sudeikis To Play Hit Man In Jared Hess Heist Comedy |website=Deadline Hollywood |date=2014-06-25 |access-date=2014-07-11}}</ref> as Michael Aaron \"Mike\" McKinney\n* [[Kate McKinnon]]<ref name=\"deadline2\"/> as Jandice Gartrell\n* [[Leslie Jones (comedian)|Leslie Jones]]<ref name=\"deadline2\"/> as FBI Special Agent Scanlon\n* [[Mary Elizabeth Ellis]]<ref name=\"deadline2\"/> as Michelle Chambers\n* [[Ken Marino]]<ref name=\"deadline2\">{{cite web|last=Yamato |first=Jen |url=https://www.deadline.com/2014/06/loomis-fargo-ken-marino-kate-mckinnon-jared-hess-relativity/ |title=Ken Marino, 'SNL's Kate McKinnon, More Join Jared Hess Heist Comedy |website=Deadline Hollywood |date=2014-06-30 |access-date=2014-07-11}}</ref> as Doug\n* Karsten Friske as Cort Chambers\n* Dallas Edwards as Ken Chambers\n* [[Devin Ratray]]<ref name=\"deadline2\"/> as Runny\n* [[Jon Daly]]<ref name=\"Daly\" /> as Detective\n* Ross Kimball<ref name=\"deadline2\"/> as Eric\n* Jordan Israel as Valet\n* Njema Williams as Ty\n* [[Kerry Rossall]] as Trunk Hostage\n\n==Production==\nOn February 1, 2013, [[Jim Carrey]] joined the cast.<ref>{{cite web|last=Fleming |first=Mike |url=https://www.deadline.com/2013/02/jim-carrey-joins-napoleon-dynamite-helmer-for-loomis-fargo/ |title=Jim Carrey Joins 'Napoleon Dynamite' Helmer For 'Loomis Fargo' |website=Deadline Hollywood |date=2013-02-01 |access-date=2014-07-11}}</ref> On June 10, 2013, [[Owen Wilson]] joined the cast of the film.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.comingsoon.net/news/movienews.php?id=105334 |title=Owen Wilson Joins Jim Carrey in the Formerly-Titled Loomis Fargo |publisher=ComingSoon.net |date=2013-06-10 |access-date=2014-07-11}}</ref> On December 3, 2013, [[Zach Galifianakis]] joined the cast to replace Carrey after he dropped out.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thewrap.com/zach-galifianakis-owen-wilson-relativity-heist-comedy/ |title=Zach Galifianakis in Final Negotiations to Join Owen Wilson in Relativity Heist Comedy (Exclusive) |publisher=TheWrap |date=2013-12-02 |access-date=2014-07-11}}</ref> On May 16, 2014, [[Kristen Wiig]] joined the cast,<ref name=\"hollywoodreporter1\"/> and on June 25, 2014, [[Jason Sudeikis]] was added as well.<ref name=\"deadline1\"/> On June 30, 2014, [[Ken Marino]], [[Kate McKinnon]], [[Devin Ratray]], [[Leslie Jones (comedian)|Leslie Jones]], [[Mary Elizabeth Ellis]] and Ross Kimball joined the cast.<ref name=\"deadline2\"/> On July 10, [[Jon Daly (comedian)|Jon Daly]] joined the cast of the film to play an FBI agent.<ref name=Daly>{{cite news|last=Sneider|first=Jeff|title=Jon Daly Joins Zach Galifianakis, Kristen Wiig in Armored Car Heist Comedy|url=https://www.thewrap.com/jon-daly-joins-zach-galifianakis-kristen-wiig-in-armored-car-heist-comedy/|access-date=July 11, 2014|publisher=thewrap.com|date=July 10, 2014}}</ref> The film was produced by [[Brent Almond]].
