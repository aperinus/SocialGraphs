It is the sequel to ''[[Captain America: The First Avenger]]'' (2011) and ''[[Captain America: The Winter Soldier]]'' (2014), and [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe films|the 13th film]] in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU). The film was directed by [[Russo brothers|Anthony and Joe Russo]] from a screenplay by the writing team of [[Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely]], and stars [[Chris Evans (actor)|Chris Evans]] as [[Steve Rogers (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Steve Rogers / Captain America]] alongside an [[ensemble cast]] including [[Robert Downey Jr.]], [[Scarlett Johansson]], [[Sebastian Stan]], [[Anthony Mackie]], [[Don Cheadle]], [[Jeremy Renner]], [[Chadwick Boseman]], [[Paul Bettany]], [[Elizabeth Olsen]], [[Paul Rudd]], [[Emily VanCamp]], [[Tom Holland]], [[Frank Grillo]], [[William Hurt]], and [[Daniel Br\u00fchl]].<!-- Billing is based on the order from the poster --> In ''Captain America: Civil War'', disagreement over international oversight of the [[Avengers (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Avengers]] fractures the team into two opposing factions\u2014one led by Steve Rogers and the other by [[Tony Stark (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Tony Stark]] (Downey).\n\nDevelopment of ''Civil War'' began in late 2013 when Markus and McFeely began writing the screenplay, which borrows concepts from the 2006 comic book storyline \"[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]\" while also focusing on story and character elements from the previous ''Captain America'' films to conclude the trilogy. Following positive reactions to ''The Winter Soldier'', the Russo brothers were brought back to direct in early 2014. The film's title and premise were revealed in October 2014, along with Downey's involvement as Stark; additional cast members joined in the following months. Principal photography began in April 2015 at [[Pinewood Atlanta Studios]] in [[Fayette County, Georgia]], and continued in the [[Atlanta metropolitan area|Metro Atlanta]] area before concluding in Germany in August 2015, with the film being the first to use [[IMAX]]'s digital 2D cameras (for the film's central airport fight sequence). Visual effects were provided by nearly 20 different studios.\n\n''Captain America: Civil War'' held its world premiere in [[Los Angeles]] on April 12, 2016, and was released in the United States on May 6, as the first film in [[Marvel Cinematic Universe: Phase Three|Phase Three]] of the MCU.<!-- Per WP:LEAD, the lead must summarize all parts of the article.

In the present day, approximately one year after [[Ultron (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Ultron]] is defeated by the [[Avengers (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Avengers]] in the nation of Sokovia,{{refn|name=Timeline|group=N|As depicted in the 2015 film ''[[Avengers: Age of Ultron]]''.<ref name=\"CapCWTimeline\" />}} [[Steve Rogers (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Steve Rogers]], [[Natasha Romanoff (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Natasha Romanoff]], [[Sam Wilson (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Sam Wilson]], and [[Wanda Maximoff (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Wanda Maximoff]] stop [[Brock Rumlow (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Brock Rumlow]] from stealing a biological weapon from a lab in [[Lagos]]. Rumlow blows himself up, attempting to kill Rogers. Maximoff telekinetically diverts the explosion, accidentally destroying a nearby building and killing several [[Wakanda (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Wakanda]]n humanitarian workers in the process.\n\n[[Thaddeus Ross (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Thaddeus Ross]], the [[United States Secretary of State|U.S. Secretary of State]],  informs the Avengers that the [[United Nations]] (UN) is preparing to pass the [[Sokovia Accords]], which will establish a UN panel to oversee and control the team. The Avengers are divided: [[Tony Stark (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Tony Stark]] supports oversight because of his role in Ultron's creation and Sokovia's devastation, while Rogers has more faith in his own judgment than that of politicians. Meanwhile, [[Helmut Zemo (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Helmut Zemo]] tracks down and kills Barnes' old Hydra handler, stealing a book containing the trigger words that activate Barnes' brainwashing. At a UN conference in [[Vienna]] where the Accords are to be ratified, a bomb kills King [[T'Chaka (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|T'Chaka]] of Wakanda. Security footage indicates the bomber is Barnes, whom T'Chaka's son, [[T'Challa (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|T'Challa]], vows to kill. Informed by [[Sharon Carter (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Sharon Carter]] of Barnes' whereabouts and the authorities' intentions to kill him, Rogers decides to try to bring in Barnes\u2014his childhood friend and war comrade\u2014himself. Rogers and Wilson track Barnes to [[Bucharest]] and attempt to protect him from T'Challa and the authorities, but all four, including T'Challa, are apprehended by the Bucharest police and [[James Rhodes (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|James Rhodes]].\n\nImpersonating a psychiatrist sent to interview Barnes, Zemo recites the words to activate Barnes's brainwashing. He questions Barnes, then sends him on a rampage to cover his own escape. Rogers stops Barnes and sneaks him away. When Barnes regains his senses, he explains that Zemo is the real Vienna bomber and wanted the location of the Siberian Hydra base, where other brainwashed \"Winter Soldiers\" are kept in [[Suspended animation|cryogenic stasis]]. Unwilling to wait for authorization to apprehend Zemo, Rogers and Wilson go rogue, and recruit Maximoff, [[Clint Barton (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Clint Barton]], and [[Scott Lang (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Scott Lang]] to their cause. With Ross's permission, Stark assembles a team composed of Romanoff, T'Challa, Rhodes, [[Vision (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Vision]], and [[Peter Parker (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Peter Parker]] to capture the renegades. Stark's team intercepts Rogers' group at [[Leipzig/Halle Airport]], where they fight until Romanoff allows Rogers and Barnes to escape.  As Rogers and Barnes are escaping, Rhodes is inadvertently shot down by Vision, and becomes partially paralyzed. The rest of Rogers' team is captured and detained at the [[Raft (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Raft]] prison, and Romanoff goes into exile.\n\nStark discovers evidence that Barnes was framed by Zemo and convinces Wilson to give him Rogers' destination. Without informing Ross, Stark goes to the Siberian Hydra facility and strikes a truce with Rogers and Barnes, unaware that they were secretly followed by T'Challa. They find that the other super-soldiers have been killed by Zemo, who then shows them footage that reveals that the automobile Barnes had intercepted in 1991 contained Stark's parents, whom Barnes subsequently killed. Enraged that Rogers kept this from him, Stark turns on them both, leading to an intense fight, in which Stark destroys Barnes' robotic arm, and Rogers disables [[Iron Man's armor (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Stark's armor]]. Rogers departs with Barnes, leaving [[Captain America's shield (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|his shield]] behind. Satisfied that he has avenged his family's deaths in Sokovia from the Avengers' actions by successfully fracturing them, Zemo attempts suicide, but he is stopped by T'Challa and taken to the authorities.\n\nIn the aftermath, Stark provides Rhodes with exoskeletal leg braces that allow him to walk again, while Rogers breaks his allies out of the Raft. In a [[mid-credits scene]], Barnes, granted asylum in Wakanda, chooses to return to cryogenic sleep until a cure for his brainwashing is found. In a [[post-credits scene]], Parker explores the features of the web shooters built for him by Stark.\n\n== Cast ==\n<!--Billing is based on the order from the poster-->\n[[File:Cast of Captain America Civil War.jpg|250px|thumb|right|(L-R) Nate Moore, [[Kevin Feige]], the [[Russo brothers]], [[Paul Bettany]], [[Daniel Br\u00fchl]], [[Robert Downey, Jr.]], [[Chris Evans (actor)|Chris Evans]], [[Tom Holland (actor)|Tom Holland]], [[Paul Rudd]], [[Elizabeth Olsen]], [[Jeremy Renner]], [[Anthony Mackie]], [[Sebastian Stan]], and [[Emily VanCamp]] at the London premiere]]\n* [[Chris Evans (actor)|Chris Evans]] as [[Steve Rogers (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Steve Rogers / Captain America]]: <br />The leader of a faction of [[Avengers (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Avengers]] against regulation;<ref name=\"VarietyAug2015\" /><ref name=\"FandangoMarch2016\" /> a World War II veteran who was enhanced to the peak of human physicality and frozen in suspended animation, before waking up in the modern world.<ref name=\"IndieWire\" /><ref name=\"VarietyCap3\" /> Director Anthony Russo described Captain America's character arc in the film as taking \"him from the most ra-ra company man\" to someone who is \"a somewhat willing propagandist\" to \"an insurgent\" at the end of the film.<ref name=\"RussosEmpire\" /> Unlike the comics' Civil War, the film was never going to kill Rogers, as the directors thought that was \"an easy ending ...

He must be both omnipotent and yet totally naive at the same time. And experiencing the world in real time and his place in it. Is he going to be a force of good or a force of evil?\"<ref name=\"BettanySept2015\" /> Bettany also said he was interested in exploring \"what it means to be human and what love is\" with the character, as \"The only way one can guarantee one's loyalty is love.\"<ref name=\"BettanyCollider\" /> This is exhibited in the connection Vision begins to form with Wanda Maximoff, with Bettany commenting, \"They both have these new burgeoning powers that they don't understand ... I think he's worried that they're both dangerous.

And I think there's some really sweet moments between Paul and I, and it's more about how they relate to one another and their similarities just based on their superpowers.\"<ref name=\"OlsenET\" />\n* [[Paul Rudd]] as [[Scott Lang (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Scott Lang / Ant-Man]]: <br />A former petty criminal allied with Rogers;<ref name=\"VarietyAug2015\" /><ref name=\"FandangoMarch2016\" /> he acquired a suit that allows him to shrink or grow in scale while also increasing in strength.<ref name=\"FullCast\" /><ref name=\"Ant-ManSynopsis\" /><ref name=\"SlashFilmSetVisitPg1\" /> Rudd's suit \"is streamlined and more high-tech\" than the one seen in ''[[Ant-Man (film)|Ant-Man]]''.<ref name=\"StitchKingdom\" /> ''Ant-Man'' director [[Peyton Reed]] had discussed the character and the way that the ''Ant-Man'' production had shot certain sequences with the Russo brothers, saying, \"As we were doing [''Ant-Man''] and we were in post and they were getting ready to head out to Atlanta to do ''Civil War'', we had a lot of conversations ... It's important because there's this continuity that has to happen in this universe.\"<ref name=\"ReedAntMan\" /> On the decision to have Lang grow in size to become [[Giant-Man]] in the airport battle, Feige said, \"It was just a great idea to turn the tide of the battle in a huge, shocking, unexpected way. We have a lot of ideas for [''[[Ant-Man and the Wasp]]''], none of which are contingent upon revealing Giant-Man, so we thought this would be the fun, unbelievable unexpected way to do that.\"<ref name=\"GiantMan\" /> Anthony Russo added that the transformation was the continuation of Lang's character arc from ''Ant-Man'', saying \"He's just really impressed with Captain America, he just wants to deliver and he figures out a way to deliver where he might actually tear himself in half but he's willing to do it and it works.\"<ref name=\"GiantMan2\" />\n* [[Emily VanCamp]] as [[Sharon Carter (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Sharon Carter]]: <br />A former agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. and [[Peggy Carter (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Peggy Carter]]'s niece who now works for the [[CIA]] and supports Rogers.<ref name=\"VarietyAug2015\" /><ref name=\"FandangoMarch2016\" /><ref name=\"VanCamp\" /><ref name=\"Kimmel4-14\" /> VanCamp stated that her character sides with Rogers because they both have \"similar moral compasses\".<ref name=\"VanCampET\" /> On a potential relationship between Rogers and Carter as in the comics, Evans said, \"he's certainly open to it. Sharon is obviously relevant, but ... we don't have to tie it up in one movie. So they have time.\"<ref name=\"JohanssonEW\" /> VanCamp added, \"We get to explore...

Does he want nothing to do with these other characters? How does that impact his experience, being this grounded but super powerful hero? Those are all the things that Stan Lee and [[Steve Ditko]] played with in the first 10 years of his comics, and that now we can play with for the first time in a movie.\"<ref name=\"FeigeSpidey\" /> On aligning with Stark, Anthony Russo said that, despite entering the conflict after the two factions have formed and not having much political investment, Parker's choice comes from \"a very personal relationship\" he develops with Stark.<ref name=\"SpideyTrailer\" /><ref name=\"SpideySide\" /> The Russos hoped \"to take a very logical and realistic and naturalistic approach to the character\" compared to the previous film portrayals. Anthony Russo added that the character's introduction had to fit \"that specific tonal stylistic world\" of the MCU, as well as the tone established by the directors in ''Winter Soldier'', saying, \"It's a little more grounded and a little more hard-core contemporary.\" That was \"coloring our choices a lot\" with Parker.<ref name=\"RussosJan2016\" /> On the Spider-Man suit, Joe Russo described it as \"a slightly more traditional, Steve Ditko influenced suit,\" and that the film would explore the way the suit operates, particularly the mechanical eyes.<ref name=\"RussosForbesMar2016Pg4\" /> Holland chose not to read the whole ''Civil War'' script in order to avoid potentially leaking plot information publicly.<ref name=\"HollandDeclineScript\" /> He was initially signed on for at least three films, not including his ''Civil War'' appearance.<ref name=\"SpideyCastingCall2\" /> Holland later expanded, saying he was signed for \"three Spider-Man movies and three solo movies\".<ref name=\"HollandContract\" />\n* [[Frank Grillo]] as [[Brock Rumlow (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Brock Rumlow]]: <br />Former commander of S.H.I.E.L.D.'s counter-terrorism [[S.T.R.I.K.E.

There's a journey that the [[Winter Soldier (comics)|Winter Soldier]] goes on that isn't complete yet.\"<ref name=\"LATimes\" /> That month, Marvel announced a release date of May 6, 2016,<ref name=\"Cap3Date\" /> and [[Trent Opaloch]], who was the cinematographer on ''The Winter Soldier'', said he would return for the sequel.<ref name=\"Opaloch\" /> In July, Markus and McFeely stated that they were midway through a first draft for the film, on which principal photography was expected to begin in April 2015.<ref name=\"MarkusMcFeelyIGN\" /> The following month, they stated that they were looking to make the tone of the film \"an amalgam\" of ''The First Avenger'' and ''The Winter Soldier'',<ref name=\"MarkusSFX\" /> with the Russos likening it to a [[psychological thriller]], citing ''[[Seven (1995 film)|Seven]]'', ''[[Fargo (1996 film)|Fargo]]'', and ''[[The Godfather]]'' as influences,<ref name=\"FandangoMarch2016\" /> along with [[Western (genre)|westerns]] and [[Brian De Palma]]'s films.<ref name=\"Collider115Things\" /> The Russos also stated that \"a good portion of [''Civil War'' is] actually funnier than ''Winter Soldier''\" with a more comedic tone and lighter moments throughout.<ref name=\"RussosPost\" />\n\nIn August 2014, the Russos stated that the film would be set \"a couple years\" after ''The Winter Soldier'', and would continue to focus on Steve Rogers' relationship with [[Bucky Barnes (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Bucky Barnes]] as well as the political themes related to Captain America. Anthony stated, \"The character was invented for an explicitly political purpose. So it's hard to get away from that nature.\" The Russos also said that they would be \"bringing some new elements to the table that will give us a twist on ''Winter Soldier''\",<ref name=\"RussosAug2014\" /> and indicated that filming was scheduled to begin in Atlanta. They described themselves as \"ecstatic\" with a first draft of the screenplay submitted by Markus and McFeely, and also stated that the film's title would be announced \"in a month or so at most\", and that the concept and title for the film came from Feige, who had it \"for a while\".<ref name=\"RussosCollider\" /><ref name=\"RussosCrave\" /> In September, Joe expanded by saying the film would have another \"big idea that alters the universe as a whole in some way\" similar to S.H.I.E.L.D. falling in ''The Winter Soldier''.

Downey was added in order for the film to adapt the 2006\u201307 \"[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]\" comic book storyline written by [[Mark Millar]], which pitted Iron Man against Captain America.<ref name=\"DowneyVariety\" /> At the end of the month, it was confirmed that [[Sebastian Stan]] would return as Bucky Barnes / Winter Soldier.<ref name=\"Stan\" /> A few days later, Marvel revealed that the film would be titled ''Captain America: Civil War'', confirming Downey's appearance and announcing that [[Chadwick Boseman]] would appear in the film as [[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]] ahead of his own [[Black Panther (film)|solo film]].<ref name=\"CivilWar\" /><ref name=\"Oct2014Event\" /><ref name=\"Boseman\" /> Feige also confirmed that the film would be the first in the MCU's [[Marvel Cinematic Universe: Phase Three|Phase Three]] slate of films.<ref name=\"Oct2014EventQA\" /> Anthony Russo stated that adapting the \"Civil War\" storyline was not always the intended storyline and direction for the film when the brothers initially signed on to return as directors.<ref name=\"RussosForbesMar2016Pg3\" /> Markus expanded on this, saying the original concept for a third Captain America film \"never got to draft\", with Feige at some point telling the writing team to begin adapting \"Civil War\" around their original ideas. McFeely also added that, despite the shift in direction for the film, \"The central theme, even the way [[Baron Zemo|Zemo]] is operating, are from that [early] iteration.\"<ref name=\"WritersDifferentDirection\" /> The Russos revealed that, had negotiations with Downey to appear in the film failed, they would have used the Madbomb storyline from the Captain America comics, which was eventually used as a plot point in the [[Agent Carter (season 1)|first season]] of the ''[[Agent Carter (TV series)|Agent Carter]]'' TV series. The premise for the film would have centered on Zemo detonating the Madbomb, which would \"turn hordes of people into berserkers\" to present a physical threat to Captain America, while still pitting heroes against each other, as some would be zombified due to the Madbomb, to satisfy an \"emotional component\" for the film.<ref name=\"Madbomb\" />\n\nMcFeely said that the idea of basing a film on \"Civil War\" had \"been on and off the table for a while\" at Marvel Studios, explaining, \"it's a challenge to do it and make sure that all the characters that we've established, and everyone's established in the MCU are serviced and sound correct. Because there's a difference between the characters in \"Civil War\", which was written in 2006, 2007. The MCU doesn't exist [when it was written]. There isn't a Robert Downey, Jr. or Chris Evans who has helped create the character[s] so we need to make sure that that template gets adjusted\".<ref name=\"McFeelyIGNJan2015\" /> Joe Russo added that the \"essence\" of \"Civil War\" was used, such as \"the concept of registration, the notion that heroes need to be either monitored or controlled because their power can be scary\" being applicable. Anthony Russo expanded, \"in a lot of ways [superhero registration] can be a political issue, and we didn't want the conflict of the movie to solely exist on that level. We wanted to figure out very personal reasons why everyone's relationship to this idea of registration is going to become complicated. That's what the relationship between Steve and Bucky allowed us to do, to get very personal in terms of why people would lean one way or the other.\"<ref name=\"RussosEmpire\" /> Executive producer Nate Moore added that \"it felt like it was kind of the right time\" to adapt \"Civil War\" given ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]'', plus many of the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe: Phase Two|Phase Two]] films (''[[Thor: The Dark World]]'', ''The Winter Soldier'', and ''Avengers: Age of Ultron''), all dealt with \"world-ending experiences. We felt like we had to tell the next step in that story, which is ... what is the world's reaction?\"<ref name=\"FandangoMarch2016\" />\n\nExecutives at [[Marvel Entertainment]] balked at the idea of Captain America and Iron Man coming to blows at the end of the film and wanted the Avengers to unite to fight Zemo and the supersoliders at the Hydra base in Siberia instead. The Russos were not happy with this idea, with Joe Russo saying, \"There's nothing interesting about that film. We're not here to make that movie. We're not interested in telling another superhero story.\" Feige supported the Russos, who were going to leave the film if the changes were mandated on them.<ref name=\"ComicBookOct2021\" /> This prompted [[Walt Disney Studios (division)|Walt Disney Studios]] head [[Alan F.

That's what we try to bring out in the characters now.\" He also mentioned that they were \"trying to honor the feeling of naturalism and to honor the feeling of reality [with the film].\"<ref name=\"RussosJan2016\" />\n\nAfter the reveal of the film's full cast, many outlets and fans began referring to the film as \"''Avengers 2.5''{{&nbsp}}\", given the variety and ensemble nature of the cast, usually reserved for the ''Avengers'' films, and the fact that the film no longer felt like a Captain America-centric one, as with ''The Winter Soldier''.<ref name=\"THRAvengers2.5\" /><ref name=\"ETAvengers2.5\" /><ref name=\"EWAvengers2.5\" /><ref name=\"YahooAvengers2.5\" /><ref name=\"ForbesAvengers2.5\" /> In response to this, Feige said, \"What's fun about ''Civil War'' though is, as you know from the comics, it's a very simple story. And it really has to be, to accommodate that many players. It's very much a Captain America movie and it's very much a sequel to the ''Winter Soldier'' in ways I don't think people [will expect].... It's a very simple structure that allows you to have these amazing character interactions in a way that I don't think becomes overwhelming.\"<ref name=\"io9\" /> Feige also revealed that [[Hope van Dyne (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Hope van Dyne]] / [[Wasp (comics)|Wasp]] was in an original draft of the film, after receiving the Wasp costume at the end of ''[[Ant-Man (film)|Ant-Man]]'', but was cut because \"there are so many characters in ''Civil War'' that we didn't want to do her a disservice,\" saying Marvel was \"saving\" the character for a better environment to reveal van Dyne in the Wasp costume for the first time and see \"her dynamic with Scott [Lang] in a way it could play out\".<ref name=\"Wasp\" />\n\nAt the end of May, the Russo brothers, along with Feige and Pascal, held a [[screen test]] in Atlanta for six teenage actors that were being eyed for the role of Peter Parker / Spider-Man, with the actors testing against Downey and Evans for \"chemistry\";<ref name=\"SpideyCastingCall2\" /><ref name=\"RussosForbesMar2016Pg3\" /><ref name=\"SpideyCastingCall\" /> [[Tom Holland (actor)|Tom Holland]] was cast as the character the next month, to also appear in a solo film.<ref name=\"Holland\" /> The Russos \"were pretty vocal about who we wanted for the part\", pushing to cast an actor close to the age of Peter Parker in the comics, in order to differentiate from the previous portrayals,<ref name=\"SpideyEW\" /> with Anthony Russo believing Holland's age was one of the factors Sony was initially hesitant on Holland for the role.<ref name=\"BritishGQ\" /> They also praised Holland for having a dancing and gymnastics background.<ref name=\"SpideyEW\" /> Downey felt of all the actors he tested with, Holland brought \"gravitas and the confidence to be able to take on the mantle\" of portraying Spider-Man.<ref name=\"BritishGQ\" />  At the time, Marvel did not confirm his involvement in ''Civil War'',<ref name=\"HollandMarvel\" /><ref name=\"SpideyNotConfirmed\" /> due to being [[Non-disclosure agreement|contractually obligated not to talk]] about his inclusion publicly.<ref name=\"SpideyEW\" /> The Russos discussed this, saying that the various business deals and agreements stemming from the sharing of the character rights, such as on a promotional and commercial level, \"were always lagging slightly behind how we were using the character.

According to Joe Russo, approximately fifteen minutes of the film, the sequence where the two factions fight at Leipzig/Halle Airport, which was described as having \"incredible scale to it\" and referred to by the directors as the \"[[Splash page (comics)|splash panel]]\", were shot with the cameras.<ref name=\"SlashFilmSetVisitPg1\" /><ref name=\"IMAXCamera\" /> Opaloch noted that there were discussions late in pre-production to shoot the entire film with the Alexa 65 cameras. However, because of how close it was to the start of shooting as well as the idea being \"such a large-scale undertaking\", it was decided to only use them for the airport sequence, with the rest of film being shot on [[Arri Alexa#Alexa XT|Arri Alexa XT]] digital cameras. For the airport sequence, Opaloch rigged the Alexa 65s to a [[Technocrane]], a [[Steadicam]], a [[Camera dolly|dolly]] as well as a drone for flyover shots, which had its own dedicated team operating it. Because of the amount of resolution the Alexa 65s offered, Opaloch chose to use medium close-ups instead of close-ups, and for his wide shots, hold the shot a bit longer, \"maybe with a slight camera move that allows the viewer to take it all in.\"<ref name=\"OpalochTHR\" />\n\n=== Post-production ===\nIn September 2015, [[Mark Ruffalo]], who plays [[Bruce Banner (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Bruce Banner / Hulk]] in the MCU films, stated that his character was originally in the ''Civil War'' script, but was removed due to the end of ''Age of Ultron'', as Marvel did not \"want to reveal where [he is] and why\" in this film.<ref name=\"Hulk\" /> Markus added that as soon as the Hulk joined a side, the fight would be quickly over, saying, \"You've got to kind of choose your roster [of characters] depending on what kind of fight you want to have.\"<ref name=\"SpideyEW\" /> He later explained that he contemplated having the Hulk appear at the very end of the film, but decided against it, feeling that he was over-stuffing the film with characters, adding, \"[The Hulk] has clearly gone somewhere at the end of ''[Age of] Ultron'', and that's a story. Don't blow it off and put it in a little tiny chunk just to put in a little extra filigree on our movie.\"<ref name=\"MarkusHulk\" /> Additionally, Ross' alter ego, [[Red Hulk]], was also considered for inclusion, but the Russos felt that part of the character would need a proper backstory which they could not afford to give in the already crowded film. They felt that Ross \"was there sort of as the government's agenda and not to add another complicated super powered character to the mix.\" Spider-Man's [[Iron Spider]] suit was also considered.<ref name=\"RedHulkIronSpider\" />\n\nThat November, Joe Russo stated that the theme of the film was betrayal, calling it \"extremely emotional. [The film] hinges on that emotion, and on a very personal level we didn't want [it] to become about politics and people arguing about platitudes. The third act is built around a very personal moment between [Captain America and Iron Man].\"<ref name=\"RussosEmpire\" /> The Russos spent a great deal of time with Markus, McFeely, and Moore to ensure each character's emotional arc tracked through the entire film correctly, though realized that at some point \"you have to sacrifice logic for expediency\".<ref name=\"Collider115Things\" /> Speaking about the post-production process in January 2016, the Russo brothers said, \"This has been the easiest post process we've ever had on a film. We're very happy with how the movie was. Everyone is very happy with where the movie was. For us, the tricky thing is the effects because it's a very complicated movie and there are some really big sequences in the film. The effects are on a much larger scale than the work we did on ''Winter Soldier''. That's the part that becomes really difficult because you don't have a lot of time and everyone has very high standards.

Lola VFX [[De-aging in film|de-aged]] Downey Jr. in a scene that involved a younger holographic version of himself. Lola VFX's visual effects supervisor, [[Trent Claus]] said, \"In this case, we analyzed footage of Mr. Downey at the approximate age that we wanted to target, which was around the time of the film ''[[Less than Zero (film)|Less than Zero]]'' [when Downey was in his early 20s].\" He also noted the difficulty of the scene, due to it being close to 4,000 frames, and the fact that Downey was moving his head from side to side multiple times. Lola also worked on visual effects for the Vision.<ref name=\"FXGuide\" /> The Third Floor extensively [[Previsualization|previsualized]] the film including the fight scene at Leipzig/Halle Airport. Gerardo Ramirez, the Previs and Postvis Supervisor for The Third Floor said:\n\n<blockquote>We visualized most of the major scenes in the film, some that were more story driven and some that were more action and story driven. The Russos used various methods for planning and they used each department for what it does best. The early edits were a combination of storyboards, previs and stunt performance clips. Stunts would choreograph the hand-to-hand action while the storyboards would be used for character story moments and previs was used for the big action scenes that involved many digital characters.<ref name=\"FXGuide\" /></blockquote>\n\nMethod Studios, which worked on 440 shots, was responsible for the helicopter sequence in the middle of the film and the climactic fight between Iron Man, Bucky, and Captain America. The original intent for the helicopter sequence was to place the scene next to the Paul-L\u00f6be-Haus, where the [[Bundestag]] meets; however, the location was not allowed to be shown in the film, resulting in Method needing to create a full CGI background. For the climactic fight, one of the challenges for Method was getting the color of Iron Man's suit correct, opting to go with a more \"classic Iron Man look versus the really glossy car paint look\" that Iron Man had in the previous Avengers films. ILM was primarily responsible for the visual effects during the large-scale fight sequence at the airport, along with creating the digital assets for all of the characters. VFX supervisor Russell Earl, stated that the 20-minute scene grew to be an almost fully digital sequence explaining, \"We ultimately ended up replacing 99% of everything that was shot with the actors being lifted from the background. Originally both Spider-Man and Black Panther were planned to be photographed elements but we ended up almost completely replacing them.\" Luma Pictures, who also worked on ''Winter Soldier'', was assigned with completing shots of Bucky's arm and his metal brainwashing chair. They also worked on Bucky's escape from the task force lobby and designed Iron Man's new hybrid [[nanotechnology]] armor, which was an homage to the character's [[Iron Man's armor#Bleeding Edge Armor|Bleeding Edge armor]] from the comics. Their work totaled approximately 200 shots.<ref name=\"FXGuide\" /> Spider-Man was a [[digital double]] for all of his appearances, featuring his finalized suit; on-set, Holland wore a temporary Spider-Man suit that featured raised webbing and a different spider emblem, or a [[motion capture]] suit.<ref name=\"SpiderManDigitalDoubleVox\" />\n\nDesign firm Sarofsky once again worked on the film's main-on-end title sequence, having done the same for ''Winter Soldier''. The sequence used \"muted and mottled, burnt umber and steel blue and cold grey\" colors, which were stark contrasts to the sequences for ''Winter Soldier'' and ''The First Avenger'' (the latter created by Method Design) which were \"a minimalist graphic approach, reducing the key players to silhouettes and paring the palette down to three colors\" and \"vibrant and iconic propaganda art comes to life, enticing the viewer to join the fray\", respectively. Creative director Erin Sarofsky noted one of the challenges for ''Civil War''{{'}}s sequence was \"to make it feel like a Captain America title sequence and not an Avengers sequence\" given the number of characters in the film.<ref name=\"TitleSequence\" />\n\n== Music ==\n{{Main|Captain America: Civil War (soundtrack)|Music of the Marvel Cinematic Universe}}\n[[Henry Jackman]] returned from ''Winter Soldier'' to score the sequel.<ref name=\"JackmanCW\" /> He found the movie to be tonally different from the previous one, which necessitated a much more symphonic and orchestral score. This culminates in the final fight between Captain America, Winter Soldier, and Iron Man, the music for which Jackman described as \"somewhat operatic and ... almost classical in its style\".<ref name=\"JackmanCWcollider\" /> Though Jackman reprised and developed his themes for Captain America and the Winter Soldier from the previous film,<ref name=\"JackmanCWsw\" /><ref name=\"JackmanCWblackfilm\" /> and introduced [[leitmotifs|motifs]] for the new characters Spider-Man, Black Panther, and Zemo,<ref name=\"JackmanCWcollider\" /> he was wary of pushing the audience to one side of the central conflict or the other by using character-specific music; Jackman composed a new main theme for the film to represent the Civil War, \"a generic theme to balance everything out\",<ref name=\"JackmanCWbsp\" /> \"toward which all the characters can gravitate. It wrapped them all up and it helped to bind the movie together rather than do endless disparate themes.\"<ref name=\"JackmanCWbelief\" /> Jackman also wrote a thriller theme that appears whenever the mystery surrounding Zemo's plan is explored. This was inspired by the works of [[Jerry Goldsmith]].<ref name=\"JackmanCWsw\" /> The score was released on a soundtrack album by [[Hollywood Records]] on May 6, 2016.<ref name=\"SoundtrackRelease\" />\n\n== Marketing ==\n===Promotion===\nIn early July 2015, Marvel began a [[viral marketing]] campaign for ''Ant-Man'' featuring [[Leslie Bibb]], reprising her role from the ''Iron Man'' films as journalist [[Christine Everhart]], reporting for the faux news program, ''[[WHIH Newsfront]]''. In one program, Everhart discusses events leading to ''Captain America: Civil War''.<ref name=\"Bibb\" /> The post-credits scene for ''Ant-Man'' featured footage shot by the Russo brothers for ''Captain America: Civil War'',<ref name=\"AMPostCredit\" /><ref name=\"AMPostCredit2\" /> showing Wilson and Rogers with Barnes in their custody, and unable to contact Stark because of \"the accords\"; Wilson mentions that he \"know[s] a guy\", implying Lang.<ref name=\"AMPostCredit3\" /> Feige explained that when the post-credit sequence appears in ''Civil War'' it may appear with \"different takes...different angles.\"<ref name=\"AMPostCredit\" /> Stan said the scene was shot in early May 2015, and would appear in the middle of ''Civil War''.<ref name=\"StanCollider\" /> The first footage of the film debuted in August 2015 at the [[Disney D23|D23 Expo]].<ref name=\"EWD23\" /> Additional footage was shown in September 2015 at the [[Asia Pop Comic Convention]].<ref name=\"AsiaPop\" /> The footage shown at the D23 Expo and 2015 Asia Pop Comic Convention received an overwhelmingly positive response from the audiences.<ref name=\"SRSept2015\" />\n\nThe first trailer for the film debuted on ''[[Jimmy Kimmel Live!]]'' on November 25, 2015, and within hours became the number one trending topic on [[Twitter]].<ref name=\"THR-trailer\" /> The trailer was viewed 61 million times in [[List of most viewed online trailers in the first 24 hours|the first 24 hours of release]], surpassing the 34 million views of ''Avengers: Age of Ultron''{{'}}s in 2014.<ref name=\"TrailerViews\" /> Scott Mendelson of ''[[Forbes]]'' called the trailer a \"[[wikt:doozy|doozy]]\" and noted that the early debut ahead of the release of ''[[Star Wars: The Force Awakens]]'' was a \"good show\" on behalf of Disney as it was \"a way to not get lost amid the 8,000 other trailers debuting with ''Star Wars''\". Mendelson also noted that based on the trailer's content, the film was being \"sold as ''Captain America 3'', as opposed to ''Avengers 2.5'' or ''Iron Man 4'',\" which could help keep the film's box office expectations in check.<ref name=\"Forbes-trailer\" />\n\nOn February 4, 2016, Marvel released their own version of the [[Facebook]] \"#FriendsDay\" video for Captain America. The video mirrors those created by Facebook for users to celebrate the anniversary of Facebook's founding, and features images of Captain America's \"friends\" the Winter Soldier, [[Thor (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Thor]], Falcon and Hawkeye. The video concludes with an image of Captain America and Iron Man being torn in half. Jennifer Konerman of ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' called the video \"timely\" and its contents \"especially relevant considering the storyline\" of ''Civil War''.<ref name=\"FriendsDayVideo\" /> Three days later, a teaser debuted during [[Super Bowl 50]], which received the most social media activity out of all the film trailers released that day.<ref name=\"VarietySuperBowlTeaser\" /><ref name=\"DeadlineSuperBowlTeaser\" /> Anthony Breznican of ''Entertainment Weekly'' said the footage \"actually feels a little more like a teaser [than a full trailer], since it shows some new shots, but really doesn't reveal much more about the story.\" Additionally, he felt the chanting \"unseen voices calling out, 'United...We...Stand' and 'Divided...We...Fall'\" had \"a football stadium vibe\", complimenting it appearing during the Super Bowl.<ref name=\"EWSuperBowlTeaser\" /> Mendelson added that Marvel did not need to follow the model used for ''The Winter Soldier'' during [[Super Bowl XLVIII]] of showing a longer trailer after the teaser since ''Civil War'' was \"frankly [a] higher-profile sequel.\" Overall, Mendelson felt the spot was \"only a little less low-key and small(er)-scale as the trailer that debuted in\" November 2015, and sold the \"real world\" aspect \"with character drama and mostly real-world action between would-be superheroes.\"<ref name=\"ForbesSuperBowlTeaser\" />\n\nFour days later, on [[Valentine's Day]], the Facebook campaign was continued, with Marvel creating a \"faux-status update\" for Captain America, showing his relationship status had changed to \"In a Complicated Relationship with Iron Man\".<ref name=\"FacebookValentines\" /> At [[The Walt Disney Company]]'s [[Annual general meeting|annual shareholder meeting]] in the [[Auditorium Theatre]] in March, CEO [[Bob Iger]] presented a clip from the film to \"generous applause\".<ref name=\"ShareholderMeeting\" /> From March 7 to 10, Marvel released individual posters for characters in the film,<ref name=\"ForbesCharacterPosters\" /> continued its Facebook campaign with two teaser videos showcasing the participants on \"Team Cap\" and \"Team Iron Man\", and released a second trailer.<ref name=\"RollCallTeasers\" /> The trailer was viewed close to 95 million times within the first 24 hours of release, surpassing the views achieved by the first trailer. In addition, 240,000 social media posts across Twitter, Tumblr, Instagram, and Facebook, among others, were made related to the trailer, surpassing the 81,000 the ''Age of Ultron'' trailer received in 2014.<ref name=\"Trailer2Views\" /> According to internet analytics firm ZEFR, the trailer was viewed over 62&nbsp;million times from YouTube and Facebook over four days, making it the second most viewed trailer at the time, behind the 64.6&nbsp;million views for the first ''Star Wars: The Force Awakens'' trailer.<ref name=\"ZEFRTrailer\" /> It also became the top trailer in 2016 through March 13, 2016, according to research firm ListenFirst, for receiving the most likes, retweets and other engagement on Twitter.<ref name=\"TopTwitterTrailer\" /> The trailer continued to be the top viewed trailer on YouTube and Facebook for three straight weeks according to ZEFR, receiving more than 96 million total views since its release.<ref name=\"ZEFRTopTrailer\" />\n\nMendelson called the trailer \"a textbook case for unnecessary second pitches...Is there anyone out there who watched that first teaser back in December and said 'Hmm, it looks good and all, but I need more evidence'?\" He added that he was \"a little disappointed by the big Spider-Man reveal,\"<ref name=\"ForbesMendelsonTrailer2\" /> having previously wondered, after a Spider-Man character poster was not released with the others, if Marvel would have the \"courage\" to not include the character in any marketing materials before the film's release, letting the \"Peter Parker scenes the film has to offer be something that is a surprise for theatrical moviegoers and/or something that drives post-opening weekend buzz\".<ref name=\"ForbesCharacterPosters\" /> Mendelson's colleague at ''Forbes'' Mark Hughes felt differently, noting that the trailer was targeting the general audience rather than just fans by giving \"us more explanation [and context] of why a clearly major battle is raging between Captain America and Iron Man\",<ref name=\"ForbesHughesTrailer2\" /> and by including Spider-Man since \"there are plenty of surprises in these movies, and since we all already know Spider-Man is in ''Civil War'', refusing to let us see him would frankly be a bit weird and pointless ... it's common for average filmgoers to hear some final bit of information or see some final image and feel compelled, inspired, or otherwise driven to go out to the movies that day. There are any number of factors that can come into play...and the world needed to see [Spider-Man] because it's the sort of value-added element that can make [a] difference\".<ref name=\"ForbesHughesTrailer2\" /> Graeme McMillan of ''The Hollywood Reporter'' felt that the Spider-Man reveal \"alone makes the trailer\", describing it as feeling \"like the comic book character come to life. That awkward, voice-cracking, 'hey everyone' was as humble, playing-it-cool and cocky as he should be.\"<ref name=\"THRTrailer2\" />\n\nWith the film seemingly continuing plot threads first introduced in ''Age of Ultron'', Mendelson wondered \"to what extent the whole 'Consequences galore!' narrative of ''Civil War'' will improve ''Age of Ultron''. As much great stuff as that movie has ... [it ultimately shows] the main hero foolishly/recklessly [bring] a world-killing threat to Earth and lots of really bad stuff goes down and yet no one seems to care at the end ... What does it mean if ''Civil War'' does retroactively improve ''Age of Ultron''? Will we be at a point where we really can't judge a franchise installment on its own merits because a future installment may well fix the flaws a couple years down the line?\"<ref name=\"ForbesMendelsonTrailer2\" /> McMillan continued some of Mendelson's thinking, feeling that Marvel was \"in an awkward place with ''Civil War''\" regarding superhero destruction moving forward. He wondered how superhero oversight would \"actually prevent the kind of destruction that it's meant to stop ... unless the bad guys all agree to play by the new rules\" as well. \"Worse still ... the destruction caused by superhero fights [should now be] foremost in viewers' heads ... the audience won't be able to enjoy the sight of the Hulk smashing a random minion through a wall without thinking of the property damage and/or whoever was standing on the other side of that wall. After ''Civil War'', can Marvel go back to pretending that everyone is okay after any large scale event ever again?\"<ref name=\"THRTrailer2\" />\n\nAlso in March, Marvel, in partnership with the [[National Academy of Sciences]] [[Science & Entertainment Exchange]], [[Dolby Laboratories]], [[Broadcom]], and [[Synchrony Financial|Synchrony Bank]], announced the \"Girls Reforming the Future Challenge\", aimed at females aged 15 through 18 in [[STEM fields|STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics education) fields]], to submit projects they feel can change the world and have far-reaching effects. Five winners would attend the world premiere at the Dolby Theatre, and receive a tour of [[Walt Disney Studios (Burbank)|Walt Disney Studios]] and a $500 saving account from Synchrony Bank, with one grand prize winner receiving an internship at Marvel Studios.<ref name=\"ScienceProgram\" /> On April 10, Evans debuted an exclusive clip of the film during the [[2016 MTV Movie Awards]].<ref name=\"MTVMovieAwards\" /> Throughout the month, the Russo brothers and the cast promoted the film in Paris, Beijing, Singapore, Berlin and London.<ref name=\"PromoTour\" /> At the end of the month, Marvel released additional viral marketing videos of ''WHIH Newsfront'', featuring Bibb once again reprising her role as Everhart. In the program, Everhart discusses with \"political analyst\" Will Adams, portrayed by [[Al Madrigal]], the cost the Avengers bring for saving the world, and if they should have regulation from the government.<ref name=\"WHIH\" /> Additional ''Newsfront'' segments saw [[William Sadler (actor)|William Sadler]] reprise his role as President Matthew Ellis, including an \"exclusive\" interview and his reaction to the incident involving the Avengers in Lagos.<ref name=\"WHIHEllis\" /><ref name=\"WHIHEllis2\" /> On May 2, 2016, Evans, Renner, and executives from Marvel rang the opening bell of the [[New York Stock Exchange]] in honor of the film's theatrical release.<ref name=\"NYSE\" />\n\n=== Merchandise ===\nAt the 2015 Licensing International Expo, [[Disney Consumer Products]] announced that they would partner with licensees including [[Hasbro]], [[Lego]], [[Funko]], [[Hot Wheels]], Rubies, Mad Engine, C-Life, Jay Franco, Global Brand Group, [[Kellogg's]], [[Hallmark Cards|Hallmark]] and [[American Greetings]] to sell merchandise related to the film;<ref name=\"Merchandise\" /> [[Coca-Cola]],<ref name=\"CokeMarketer\" /> [[Google]], [[Samsung]], [[Wrigley Company|Wrigley]], [[Harley Davidson]], [[Audi]], Synchrony Financial, [[Pringles]], [[Keebler Company|Keebler]], [[Pizza Hut]], [[Pop Secret]], [[Mouser Electronics]], and [[Vivo (smartphone)|Vivo]], among other brands, were also licensees for the film.<ref name=\"Marketing\" /> Paul Gitter, senior VP of licensing for Marvel at Disney Consumer Products said that they will build off the success of licensed products for ''Avengers: Age of Ultron'', including a focus on a celebration of Captain America's 75th anniversary, female apparel, healthy living and travel, and on marketing newer characters such as War Machine, Falcon, Vision, Black Widow and Black Panther. \"The Avengers team is both aspirational and hugely merchandisable, made up of multiple, unique heroes coming together with amazing skills, cool vehicles and a high tech headquarters,\" said Gitter. \"''Captain America: Civil War'' not only gives us new storytelling for our favorite superheroes, but also introduces new ones allowing us to expand product lines for kids and fans.\"<ref name=\"Merchandise\" /> As part of the $200 million marketing effort for the film, Harley Davidson created two customized motorcycles for the film, Audi debuted a commercial directed by the Russos featuring unreleased scenes from the film, while Pizza Hut debuted collectible boxes and Kellogg's, Pringles, and Keebler products featured [[virtual reality]] experiences.

Spellman and [[Dalan Musson]], who was a series writer on ''The Falcon and the Winter Soldier'', were writing the script.<ref name=\"Cap4THR\" /> Mackie joined the film to star by that August.<ref
