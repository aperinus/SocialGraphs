The screenplay is based on a short story of the same name by [[Jim Thompson (writer)|Jim Thompson]].\n\n==Plot==\nAs children, Marty and Carol Lakewood, fraternal twins, witness a brutal murder involving their father. They grow up to become depraved and incestuous adults, living in coastal California in the mid-1950s.\n\nMarty is a skillful journalist, but grows bored with every new job and is easily distracted. When he seduces a young police officer, Lois Archer, and discovers she owns a beach house, Marty sets out to double-cross her and make the property his own.\n\nCarol is a heartless prostitute, willing to go to any lengths to con men out of their money, or make them pay in other ways. Powerless to stop them is Mrs. Lakewood, a weak-willed woman who suspects the terrible truth in her children's relationship, but knows no way to stop it.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Billy Zane]] as Marty\n**[[Christopher Jones (actor)|Christopher Jones]] as Young Marty\n***Christian Durango as Little Marty\n* [[Gina Gershon]] as Carol\n**Megan Leigh Brown as Young Carol\n***Sloan Cobb as Little Carol\n* [[Sheryl Lee]] as Lois\n* [[Rue McClanahan]] as Mrs. Lakewood\n**[[Roberta Hanley]] as Young Mrs. Lakewood\n* [[Seymour Cassel]] as Detective Harris\n* [[Will Patton]] as Lieutenant Morgan\n* [[Richard Edson]] as Joe\n* Tom Keeley as Lyle\n* [[William Hootkins]] as Jake Krutz\n* Philip Loch as Marty Lakewood's Father\n* Elis Imboden as neighbor's Wife\n* Mark Jeffrey Miller as Lloyd\n* Marianna Alacchi as Glenda\n* Robert Pentz as Lou\n* Orson Oblowitz as Eugene\n* Thad Mace as Tim\n* Jonathan Taylor Luthren as Ben\n* Stephanie Fisher as Claire\n* Lou Criscuolo as McCloud\n* Jeffrey Pillars as Galloway\n* John Bennes as Griffith\n* [[Barry Bell]] as Barnett Gibons\n* David Lenthall as Doctor\n* Terry Nienhuis as Minister\n* [[Valentin de Vargas]] as Mexican Doctor\n* Dean Mumford as Marine\n* Willy Cobbs as Blues Musician\n* Brian Keith Gamble as Spindly Man\n* Mert Hatfield as Bus Driver\n* [[Matt O'Toole]] as Thug 1\n* Norman Max Maxwell as Thug 2\n\n==Reception and release==\nOn [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film has a 38% approval rating based on 8 reviews, with an [[Weighted arithmetic mean|average ranking]] of 3.9/10.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/this_world_then_the_fireworks|title=This World, Then the Fireworks (1997)|website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|publisher=[[Fandango Media]]|accessdate=August 10, 2021}}</ref>\n\n[[Todd McCarthy]] of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' wrote \"In the hands of filmmaker Michael Oblowitz, novelist Jim Thompson's story \"This World, Then the Fireworks\" gets an elegantly stylish, highly erotic, intentionally over-the-top rendition\".<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://variety.com/1997/film/reviews/this-world-then-the-fireworks-1117432644/|last=McCarthy|first=Todd|authorlink=Todd McCarthy|title=This World, Then the Fireworks|magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=February 1, 1997}}</ref>\n\n''[[Total Film]]'' called the film \"sexy, stylized, deliberately overheated slice of noir\".<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.gamesradar.com/this-world-then-the-fireworks-review/|title=This World, Then the Fireworks Review|magazine=[[Total Film]]|publisher=[[GamesRadar+]]|date=December 5, 1997}}</ref>\n\nOn November 14, 2017, [[Kino International (company)|Kino Lorber]] released a [[Blu-ray]] of the film.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.zekefilm.org/2017/11/08/this-world-then-the-fireworks-1997-blu-ray-review/|last=Mory|first=Justin|title=This World, Then the Fireworks (1997) Blu-ray Review|date=November 8, 2017|accessdate=August 10, 2021}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{IMDb title|0117898}}\n*{{Allmovie title|154550}}\n*{{AFI film|61533}}\n\n{{Jim Thompson}}\n\n[[Category:1997 crime drama films]]\n[[Category:American crime drama films]]\n[[Category:American neo-noir films]]\n[[Category:Films about twins]]\n[[Category:Films based on Jim Thompson novels]]\n[[Category:Films set in the 1950s]]\n[[Category:Films shot in North Carolina]]\n[[Category:Incest in film]]\n[[Category:Largo Entertainment films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Michael Oblowitz]]\n[[Category:1990s English-language films]]\n[[Category:1990s American films]]\n\n\n{{1990s-crime-drama-film-stub}}"}]}}}}
