It is set in the universe of the [[Science fiction|sci-fi]]-based ''[[Star Wars]]'' media franchise. Directed by [[Steve Binder]], it was the first ''Star Wars'' spin-off film, set between the events of [[Star Wars (film)|the original film]] and ''[[The Empire Strikes Back]]'' (1980). It stars the main cast of the original ''Star Wars'' and introduces the character of [[Boba Fett]], who appeared in later films.\n\nIn the story line that ties the special together, following the events of the original film, [[Chewbacca]] and [[Han Solo]] attempt to visit the [[Wookiee]] home planet of [[Wookiee#Home planet|Kashyyyk]] to celebrate \"Life Day\". They are pursued by agents of the [[Galactic Empire (Star Wars)|Galactic Empire]], who are searching for members of the [[Rebel Alliance]] on the planet. The special introduces three members of Chewbacca's family: his father [[Chewbacca|Itchy]], his wife [[Chewbacca#Expanded Universe|Malla]], and his son [[Lumpawarrump|Lumpy]].\n\nThe program also features the rest of the main ''Star Wars'' characters, including [[Luke Skywalker]], [[C-3PO]], [[R2-D2]], [[Darth Vader]] and [[Princess Leia]], all portrayed by the original cast (except {{nowrap|R2-D2}}, who is simply billed as \"himself\"). The program includes footage from the 1977 film and a [[Animated cartoon|cartoon]] produced by [[Toronto]]-based [[Nelvana]] featuring the [[bounty hunter]] Boba Fett. Scenes take place in space and in spacecraft including the ''[[Millennium Falcon]]'' and a [[Star Destroyer]]; segments also take place in a few other locales, such as the [[Mos Eisley]] cantina from the original film.\n\nThe special is notorious for its extremely negative reception and has never been rebroadcast nor officially released on home video. It has become somewhat of a cultural legend due to the [[Underground film|underground]] quality of its existence. It has been viewed and distributed in off-air recordings made from its original telecast by fans as [[Bootleg recording|bootleg copies]], and it has also been uploaded to content-sharing websites. In contrast, the animated segment that introduced Boba Fett was positively received and, in 2021, was released on [[Disney+]].\n\n==Plot==\nOn Life Day, Chewbacca, accompanied by Han Solo, is headed home to see his family. Along the way, the duo is chased by two [[Star Destroyer]]s, but they escape into [[Hyperspace (science fiction)#Star Wars|hyperspace]]. Meanwhile, on [[Kashyyyk]], Chewbacca's family is preparing for his return. Hoping to find the ''[[Millennium Falcon]]'', his wife, Malla, runs a computer scan for starships in the area but is unsuccessful.\n\nMalla contacts [[Luke Skywalker]], who, along with [[R2-D2]], is working on his [[X-wing fighter]]. Luke tells her that he does not know what happened. Malla contacts Saun Dann, a local trader. He tells her through a carefully worded message that Han and Chewbacca are on their way and should be arriving soon.\n\nMalla then attempts (unsuccessfully) to prepare a meal, the instructions of which are being aired via a local cooking show by an eccentric four-armed alien cook, Chef Gormaanda ([[Harvey Korman]]).\n\nSaun arrives with Life Day gifts for everyone, including a virtual reality fantasy program (featuring [[Diahann Carroll]]) for Itchy. Back on the ''Falcon'', Chewbacca and Han have just come out of hyperspace not far from Kashyyyk. Han notices an increased Imperial presence, so they decide to land in an unguarded area to the north.\n\nAs they enter the atmosphere, Lumpy hears the roaring of the ship. Believing Han and Chewie might be arriving, Malla opens the door, but instead finds two [[Stormtrooper (Star Wars)|stormtroopers]] and officers. The Imperials force their way into the house. An officer orders a search for Chewbacca.\n\nAs they search, Saun and the others attempt to distract them with food and Malla's music video box (which features a video by [[Jefferson Starship]]). When the music finishes, the head officer orders the search to continue. The head officer tells Malla to keep Lumpy busy while they search his room, so Lumpy (and the viewing audience) uses a viewscreen to watch a [[Animated cartoon|cartoon]] of his father's many adventures:\n\n<blockquote>During a search for a [[talisman]], the ''Millennium Falcon'' crashes on the water moon of Panna with the main characters onboard. They run into [[Boba Fett]], who saves Luke from a giant monster and claims to want to help the Rebels. They all board the ''Falcon'', where Han has been infected by a mysterious sleeping virus caused by the talisman. Luke then contracts the virus as well. Fett and Chewie go into Panna City to get the cure. Once they get into the Imperial-occupied city, Fett instructs Chewie to stay behind\u2014so he can contact [[Darth Vader]]. On the ''Falcon'', as C-3PO is caring for Han and Luke, R2-D2 intercepts the transmission between Vader and Fett. Evading the Imperials, Fett and Chewie return to the ''Falcon'' with the cure. After everyone recovers from the virus, they learn of Fett's true allegiances. He blasts away using his jetpack, promising they will meet again. The heroes head back to the Rebel base aboard the ''Falcon''.</blockquote>\n\nLumpy works to create a translation device that will fool the Imperials into returning to their base by faking their commander's voice. To do so, he first must watch the manual for the device, being presented by a malfunctioning, incompetent robot (also played by Korman). While the Imperials are searching downstairs, the living room viewscreen activates, announcing that [[Tatooine]] is being put under curfew by the Empire because of \"[[subversion|subversive]] forces\".\n\nThe video is announced as required viewing for all Imperial forces and much of it features Ackmena ([[Bea Arthur]]) running the [[Mos Eisley]] cantina. Ackmena is approached by an admirer: Krelman, an amorous alien, who has misunderstood something she said to him recently. Ackmena announces [[Last call (bar term)|last call]], and upon being ignored, sings a farewell song.\n\nLumpy uses this opportunity to put his plan into motion, faking a repeated call for the Imperials to \"return to base\". They leave, but one stormtrooper stays behind and realizes that they were tricked. He finds Lumpy and destroys the machine, then chases Lumpy outside.\n\nHan and Chewbacca arrive. Chewie protects Lumpy as Han kills the stormtrooper. After they are reunited, an Imperial officer appears on the viewscreen, giving a general alert for the missing stormtrooper. Saun quickly responds that the trooper stole supplies and deserted. The danger averted, the family prepares to go to the festival at the great Tree of Life. They hold glowing orbs, and appear in space wearing red robes.<ref name=latimes>{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/herocomplex/la-et-hc-star-wars-holiday-special-20181117-story.html|title='The Star Wars Holiday Special' aired only once. 40 years later, it's still weird|last=Roy|first=Jessica|date=November 17, 2018|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|access-date=November 18, 2018}}</ref>\n\nWookiees walk into a bright star and arrive at the Tree of Life, where many are gathered, including C-3PO and R2-D2. Luke, Leia, and Han also appear. Leia gives a short speech and sings a song in celebration. Chewie remembers his adventures during the events of the original film.

CBS hired experienced variety show writers and producers,<ref name=latimes/> including writer [[Bruce Vilanch]], who was concerned about the decision to center the special on a species who grunt in a fictional language without subtitles. Regardless, Lucas would not budge on his vision.<ref name=WeirdTV/> The special went through two directors. The first, [[David Acomba]], was brought in through an attempt to \"make us different in variety shows\", according to Lippincott.<ref name=WeirdTV/>\n\nAcomba, a classmate of George Lucas at [[USC School of Cinematic Arts|USC film school]], was unfamiliar with a [[multiple-camera setup]], which caused some problems. Acomba also felt that there was a divide between himself and the producers, and chose to leave the project after finishing only a few scenes, including the cantina and Jefferson Starship. He was replaced by [[Steve Binder]], whose only contact with Lucasfilm was a \"Wookiee [[Bible (screenwriting)|bible]]\" detailing how the species should look and behave.<ref name=WeirdTV/> [[Stan Winston]] was hired to design the Wookiee family.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mentalfloss.com/article/72863/dark-side-oral-history-star-wars-holiday-special|title=The Dark Side: An Oral History of The Star Wars Holiday Special|last=Rossen|first=Jake|website=Mental Floss|date=December 3, 2017|access-date=October 15, 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe special was broadcast in its entirety in the United States only once, on Friday, November 17, 1978 (the week before [[Thanksgiving]]), on the television network [[CBS]] from 8:00&nbsp;pm to 10:00&nbsp;pm, [[North American Eastern Time Zone|Eastern Standard Time]] (EST), pre-empting ''[[Wonder Woman (TV series)|Wonder Woman]]'' and ''[[The Incredible Hulk (1978 TV series)|The Incredible Hulk]]''.

The plot strings together a series of musical numbers, celebrity [[Cameo appearance|cameos]] and other variety-show acts. These include songs and comedy routines by such 1970s talents as [[Jefferson Starship]], [[Diahann Carroll]], [[Art Carney]], [[Harvey Korman]] and [[Bea Arthur]], and a circus-style [[acrobatics]] routine including [[uneven bars]] and [[juggling]]. The most notable segment is an animated cartoon featuring the onscreen debut of [[Boba Fett]].\n\n===Music===\nOriginal music was composed for ''The Star Wars Holiday Special'' by Ken and Mitzie Welch, while [[Ian Fraser (composer)|Ian Fraser]] was brought in to adapt [[John Williams]]' orchestral themes from ''Star Wars''.<ref name=WeirdTV /> The special features four songs:\n# \"This Minute Now\" is sung by [[Diahann Carroll]]. Carroll \u2013 who is supposed to be an image created by a [[virtual reality]] machine \u2013 tells Chewbacca's father, Itchy, that she is his \"fantasy\" and suggestively invites him to \"experience\" her.\n# \"Light the Sky on Fire\", performed by [[Jefferson Starship]], which is presented as a [[3-D film|3D]] music video watched by one of the Imperial guards; during production the song was given the working title \"Cigar-Shaped Object (Vanished Without a Trace)\" (the song was included as a bonus 45 [[Revolutions per minute|rpm]] single in the Jefferson Starship greatest hits collection ''[[Gold (Jefferson Starship album)|Gold]]''). (The clip marked [[Marty Balin]]'s final appearance with Jefferson Starship, as he had left the band in October 1978, a month before the special was broadcast. He later rejoined the band in 1993.)\n# Later, [[Bea Arthur]], who plays Ackmena, proprietress of the [[Mos Eisley]] [[cantina]], sings \"Good Night, But Not Goodbye\" set to the Cantina Band theme. Some of the same aliens seen in the cantina in ''Star Wars'' reappear, including the band [[Figrin D'an and the Modal Nodes]], as back-up musicians.<ref>{{cite AV media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzXKySxPFCI| archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211118/RzXKySxPFCI| archive-date=2021-11-18 | url-status=live|title=Bea Arthur sings in the Star Wars Holiday Special|date=July 11, 2006|work=YouTube}}{{cbignore}}</ref> \n# Finally, at the end of the special, [[Carrie Fisher]] sings a song in celebration of [[Life Day]] to the tune of \"[[Star Wars (Main Title)]]\" by [[John Williams]].\n\n===Comedy===\n[[Harvey Korman]] provides comedy in three of the special's skits, including the cantina skit with [[Bea Arthur]] where he plays a love-struck barfly who drinks through a hole in the top of his head.
