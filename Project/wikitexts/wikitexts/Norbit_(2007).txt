The film co-stars [[Thandie Newton]], [[Terry Crews]], [[Cuba Gooding Jr.]], [[Eddie Griffin]], [[Katt Williams]], [[Marlon Wayans]], and [[Charlie Murphy (actor)|Charlie Murphy]]. It was released by [[DreamWorks Pictures|DreamWorks]] and [[Paramount Pictures]] on February 9, 2007. Eddie Murphy portrays multiple roles including the eponymous Norbit and his abusive obese wife Rasputia; regretting ever having married her, Norbit decides he has had enough of her behavior at about the same time that his childhood sweetheart Kate returns to his life with plans for the orphanage where Norbit and Kate grew up. Norbit risks everything to be with her, but must also contend with his intimidating brothers-in-law who have an agenda of their own.\n\nThe film was a box office success; it grossed $159 million worldwide against a production budget of $60 million. It was negatively received by critics, and was nominated for eight [[Golden Raspberry Awards]], as well as nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Makeup and Hairstyling|Academy Award for Best Makeup]].\n\n==Plot==\nChildhood friends Norbit Albert Rice and Kate Thomas, living at an [[orphanage]] doubling as a [[Chinese restaurant]] called The Golden Wonton owned by Mr. Wong, are separated when Kate is adopted. They also play married each other with [[Ring Pop]]s and lived happily ever after for two weeks until Kate's adoption.\n\nFive years later, Norbit is rescued from [[playground]] bullies by a tough, [[overweight]] girl Rasputia Latimore, who becomes his protector from the other bullies and best friend, but eventually grows into an arrogant and tyrannical woman. They marry each other as adults, but Rasputia begins [[Abusive relationship|insulting and controlling him]], especially accusing him for adjusting her car seat when she is driving her car. Norbit is also belittled by Rasputia's three older brothers Big Black Jack, Blue, and Earl, working as a [[Bookkeeping|bookkeeper]] at their [[construction]] company. The Latimore brothers run a \"[[Extortion racket|security business]]\", instilling fear in the entire community except Mr. Wong, who refuses to sell them his business and not hesitate to draw out his spear and pistol to fend them off.\n\nNorbit catches Rasputia cheating on him with her tap dance instructor Buster Perkin, and calls her the 'Queen of Whores' which results her into chasing him through the neighborhood. After the chase, Norbit throws away his [[wedding ring]] and vents his anger about Rasputia's infidelity at a [[puppet show]] for the orphans. He is stunned to see Kate for the first time since childhood, and his affection for her reignites as he learns she is buying Mr. Wong's orphanage, but is disappointed to learn she is engaged to a man named Deion Hughes.\n\nWith help from ex-pimp friends Pope Sweet Jesus and Lord Have Mercy and other townspeople, Norbit meets Kate without Rasputia's knowledge and along the way, Kate teaches Norbit how to ride a bike. Deion attempts to leave town without Kate, having no intention to help her run the orphanage, but the Latimore brothers persuade him to help them to turn the orphanage into a [[strip club]] instead. The brothers dupe Norbit into getting Kate to sign papers to renew the restaurant's liquor license in the Latimores' name. Norbit's meeting with Kate leads to helping rehearse her wedding, where a kiss between them makes her reconsider marrying Deion. Norbit returns home to learn Rasputia witnessed their kiss and threatens violence towards Kate if he ever sees her again.\n\nWhen Kate later learns about the deal from Deion, she goes to confront Norbit and sees him being held prisoner by Rasputia (who masterminded the orphanage plot) in their [[basement]]. Norbit reluctantly, deliberately drives her away to protect her from Rasputia. Satisfied, Rasputia lies that Norbit has tricked Kate since she came back to town. Heartbroken, Kate runs away, and Norbit decides to permanently leave town. Then he finds a letter from the private investigator he hired, discovering Deion is rich from various divorce settlements.\n\nThe Latimores reveal their plan to Norbit, and lock him in the basement again. Norbit escapes by bike, reaching the wedding just in time to inform Kate of Deion's schemes. Though his proof of Deion's divorce settlements was destroyed after falling into a [[pond]], Norbit has a plan b and reveals Deion's ex-wives and children, and Deion flees as they give chase, which results in the Latimores' plan being blown up in their faces.\n\nThe Latimores attack Norbit for permanently ruining their plans, but the townspeople take up arms to protect him as Norbit's bravery inspiring them to stand up to the Latimores. Rasputia fights her way through the crowd and prepares to kill him, but Mr. Wong [[harpoon]]s her in the rear, causing her to run at sonic speed in pain out of town. With their strongest family member flees, the Latimores finally accept defeat and are chased out of town while Norbit and Kate reconcile. They buy the orphanage and marry under the same tree where they played as children years ago and finally live happily ever after. Rasputia and the Latimores were never seen or heard from again, but several rumors said that they move to [[Mexico]] and open up their strip club \"El Nipplopolis\", where Rasputia becomes their most popular and lucrative stripper.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Eddie Murphy]] as:\n** Norbit Albert Rice, a shy, nerdy, but likable man\n*** [[Khamani Griffin]] as Young Norbit (age 5)\n*** Austin Reid as Young Norbit (age 10)\n*** Jonathan Robinson as Young Norbit (age 17)\n** Rasputia Latimore, Norbit's [[Obesity#Morbidity|morbidly obese]], sadistic, abusive and tyrannical wife and criminal\n*** Lindsey Sims-Lewis as Young Rasputia (age 10)\n*** Yves Lola St. Vil as Young Rasputia (age 17)\n** Mr. Wong, the gruff yet kind-hearted, Chinese owner of the [[orphanage]] where Norbit and Kate met as children.\n* [[Thandie Newton]] as Kate Thomas, Norbit's childhood best friend, in whom he has had a lifelong romantic interest.\n** China Anderson as Young Kate (age 5)\n* [[Terry Crews]] as Big Black Jack Latimore, Rasputia's eldest brother and henchman\n* [[Lester Speight|Lester \"Rasta\" Speight]] as Blue Latimore, Rasputia's second eldest brother and henchman.\n* [[Clifton Powell]] as Earl Latimore, Rasputia's third eldest brother and henchman\n* [[Cuba Gooding Jr.]] as Deion Hughes, Kate's fianc\u00e9\n* [[Eddie Griffin]] as Pope Sweet Jesus, an ex-pimp and Norbit's friend\n* [[Katt Williams]] as Lord Have Mercy, Pope's sidekick and friend\n* Anthony Russell as Sam Giovanni, the Italian owner of Giovanni's\n* [[Floyd Levine]] as Abe, the tailor\n* [[Pat Crawford Brown]] as Mrs. Henderson, an elderly woman\n* [[Jeanette Miller]] as Mrs. Coleman, an elderly woman\n* [[Michael Colyar]] as Morris, the barber\n* [[Marlon Wayans]] as Buster \"Bust-A-Move\" Perkin, Rasputia's tap dancing instructor with whom Rasputia has an affair\n* [[Richard Gant]] as The Preacher\n* Alexis Rhee as Mrs. Ling Ling Wong, Mr. Wong's wife\n* [[Marianne Muellerleile]] as Helga, the epilator\n* [[Kristen Schaal]] as Event Organizer\n* [[John Gatins]] as Water Park Attendant\n* [[Smith Cho]] as Deion's Asian wife\n* [[Charlie Murphy (actor)|Charlie Murphy]] (voice) as Floyd the Dog, Mrs. Henderson's pet [[Pug]] dog (credited as Floyd the Dog)\n}}\n\n==Production==\nAfter the success of ''[[Shrek]]'', DreamWorks co-founder and CEO Jeffrey Katzenberg signed up Eddie Murphy to star in a live-action followup, and they were looking for the right film.

The surfaces was painted with [[silicone]] to make it look like skin. Silicone was also used to make matching gloves.
