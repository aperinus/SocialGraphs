In order to save Kong's life, Dr. Franklin must perform a heart transplant and give Kong a computer-monitored artificial heart. However, he has lost so much blood that a transfusion is badly needed, and to complicate matters, Franklin says there is no species of [[ape]] or other animal whose blood type matches Kong's.\n\nEnter Hank \"Mitch\" Mitchell, adventurer and Franklin's eventual love interest, who travels to [[Borneo]] (as he theorizes that Borneo and the island from the first film were once part of the same landmass) and captures a giant female ape who is dubbed \"Lady Kong\". Mitchell brings her to the institute to use her blood for King Kong's operation. The transfusion and the heart transplant are a success, but Kong escapes along with Lady Kong.\n\nArchie Nevitt, an insane army lieutenant colonel, is called in with his men to hunt down and kill the two apes. Lady Kong is captured alive by Nevitt's troops and imprisoned; Kong falls from a cliff and is presumed dead. However, as Franklin and Mitchell soon discover, Kong's artificial heart is beginning to give out, forcing them to attempt a jailbreak. They discover that Lady Kong is pregnant with Kong's offspring. The jailbreak is successful thanks to Kong, who has survived the fall and breaks his mate out. After being followed, attacked, and shot by the military, Kong kills Lt. Col Nevitt and dies slowly near a military base on a farm where Lady Kong gives birth to an infant son. Kong reaches out to touch his son just before dying. Having returned to Borneo, Lady Kong lives peacefully with her son in the jungle.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Brian Kerwin]] as Hank Mitchell\n* [[Linda Hamilton]] as Dr. Amy Franklin\n* Peter Elliott as King Kong\n* [[John Ashton (actor)|John Ashton]] as Lt.

In 1977, he said there would \"definitely\" be a sequel. \"[[Steve McQueen]] made a picture in which he died at the end, but they made another picture with Steve McQueen.

New York Times 27 Jan 1978: C20.</ref>\n\nA number of scripts had been written. \"\"They had King Kong in Russia and King Kong In outer space,\" said writer Steve Pressfield. \"Really, this is not an exaggeration. They even had one with little kids leading him around, saying things like 'Careful, Kong, don't step on that car.' It really was an embarrassment.\"<ref name=\"fang\"/> \n \nPressfield and Ron Schusett pitched the idea that Kong has been on a giant respirator for years, and he was brought back to life with an artificial heart. According to Pressfield, \"Dino loved the whole idea of the artificial heart and said, 'That's brilliant. I've been wondering for five years how to bring him back to life in a way that people would accept.' Sure, it's campy, but It's outrageous enough that it really works.\"<ref name=\"fang\">{{cite magazine|magazine=Fangoria|first=Edward|last=Gross|title=King Kong Lives|url=https://archive.org/details/Fangoria_058_c2c_1986_Fly_2_Sprout-DREGS/page/n10/mode/1up?q=%22king+kong+lives%22|page=10|issue=58|date=October 1986}}</ref>\n\nJohn Guillermin had been hoping to direct a version of ''Tai Pan'' with [[Sean Connery]] but when that project was unable to be financed he moved on to ''King Kong Lives!''<ref name=\"star\"/> The writers met with Guillermin and together devised the story about Kong getting an infusion from a female ape.\n\n\"When we came up with the idea, Dino was very skeptical and didn't want to do it,\" said Pressfield. \"It's hard enough to accept that there's a King Kong but since he has been around for 50 years he has become a pop cult hero. No one is going to believe a female ape.' I said, 'Dino, he had to have a mother,' And he said, 'By God, you're right, I never thought of that. There can be a female,' \nand we went with it.\"<ref name=\"fang\"/>\n\nThe film was announced in October 1985.

We even give a nod to women's lib with Lady Kong falling for the male scientist. Of course, this is before she meets the King.\"<ref name=\"fang\"/>\n\nGuillermin said later that making a sequel to ''King Kong'' was a bad idea. \"Dino was striking out on all sorts of things at the time.

So, I don't worry about it. We tried to have fun when we were making the movie, without poking fun at it. It's an adult fairy tale and it has humor.
