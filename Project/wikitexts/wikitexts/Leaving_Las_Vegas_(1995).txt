He loads a supply of liquor and beer into his BMW and gets drunk as he drives from Los Angeles to Las Vegas.

With nothing left to live for, and a sizable severance check from his boss, he heads to [[Las Vegas]] to drink himself to death. One early morning, he drives drunkenly from his Los Angeles home down to the [[Las Vegas Strip]]; he nearly hits a woman, Sera, on the crosswalk. She chastises him and walks away.\n\nSera is a prostitute working for abusive [[Latvians|Latvian]] [[pimp]] Yuri Butsov. [[Polish-American organized crime|Polish mobsters]] are after Yuri, so he ends his relationship with Sera in fear that the [[Poles]] may hurt her. On his second day in Las Vegas, Ben looks for Sera, introduces himself, and offers her [[United States dollar|$]]500 to come to his room for an hour. Sera agrees, but Ben does not want sex. Instead, they talk and develop a rapport; Sera invites Ben to move into her apartment. Ben instructs Sera never to ask him to stop drinking. Ben says he will not criticize her occupation either, and she thanks him.\n\nAt first, the pair are happy but soon become frustrated with the other's behavior. Sera begs Ben to see a doctor, which he refuses. While Sera is working, Ben goes to a casino and returns with another prostitute. Sera returns to find them in her bed and throws Ben out. Shortly afterward, Sera is approached by three college students at the [[Excalibur Hotel and Casino]]. She initially rejects their offer by stating that she only \"dates\" one at a time but eventually acquiesces when she is offered an increased price. When she enters their hotel room, the students change the deal and demand anal sex, which she refuses. When she attempts to leave, they violently gang-rape her.\n\nThe following day, Sera is spotted by her landlady returning home bruised and is evicted. Sera receives a call from Ben, who is on his deathbed. Sera visits Ben, and the two make love, and he dies shortly thereafter. Later, Sera explains to her therapist that she accepted Ben for who he was and loved him.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Nicolas Cage]] as Ben Sanderson\n* [[Elisabeth Shue]] as Sera\n* [[Julian Sands]] as Yuri Butsov\n* [[Richard Lewis (comedian)|Richard Lewis]] as Peter\n* [[Steven Weber]] as Marc Nussbaum\n* [[Emily Procter]] as Debbie\n* [[Valeria Golino]] as Terri\n* [[Thomas Kopache]] as Mr. Simpson\n* [[Laurie Metcalf]] as Mrs. Van Houten\n* [[French Stewart]] as Business Man #2\n* [[R.
