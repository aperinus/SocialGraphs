Directed by [[Robert Siodmak]], it featured an uncredited [[John Huston]] and [[Richard Brooks]] co-writing the screenplay, which was credited to [[Anthony Veiller]]. As in many film noir, it is mostly told in [[flashback (narrative)|flashback]].\n\nReleased in August 1946, ''The Killers'' was a critical success, earning four [[Academy Award]] nominations, including for [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]] and [[Academy Award for Best Film Editing|Best Film Editing]].\n\nHemingway, who was habitually disgusted with how Hollywood distorted his thematic intentions, was an open admirer of the film.\n\nIn 2008, ''The Killers'' was selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.\"\n\n==Plot==\nTwo [[hitmen]], Max and Al, arrive in Brentwood, [[New Jersey]], to kill Pete Lund, a former boxer known as \"The Swede\". After being confronted by the pair in a diner Lund's coworker, [[Nick Adams (character)|Nick Adams]], warns him. Strangely, Lund makes no attempt to flee, and he is shot dead in his room.\n\n\"The Swede\" is soon revealed to have really been named Ole Anderson. A life insurance investigator, Jim Reardon, is assigned to find and pay the beneficiary of the Swede's $2,500 policy. Tracking down and interviewing the dead man's friends and associates, Reardon doggedly pieces together his story. Philadelphia police Lieutenant Sam Lubinsky, a longtime friend of the Swede, is particularly helpful.\n\nIn [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]] it is revealed that the Swede's boxing career was cut short by a hand injury. Rejecting Lubinsky's suggestion to join the police force, the Swede becomes mixed up with crime boss \"Big Jim\" Colfax, and drops his girlfriend Lily for the more glamorous Kitty Collins. When Lubinsky catches Kitty wearing stolen jewelry, the Swede confesses to the crime and serves three years in prison.\n\nAfter completing his sentence, the Swede, \"Dum-Dum\" Clarke, and \"Blinky\" Franklin are recruited for a payroll robbery in [[Hackensack, New Jersey]], masterminded by Colfax. Complicating matters is the fact that Kitty is now with Colfax. The robbery nets the gang $254,912. When their boarding house allegedly burns down, all of the gang members but the Swede are notified of a new rendezvous place. Kitty tells the Swede that he is being double-crossed by his associates, inciting him to take all of the money at gunpoint and flee. Kitty meets with him later in [[Atlantic City, New Jersey|Atlantic City]], then disappears with the money herself.\n\nIn the present, Reardon stakes out the hotel where the Swede was killed. He witnesses Dum-Dum sneaking into the building, searching for a clue that might lead him to the loot. Reardon confronts him, but he flees before he can be arrested. Reardon subsequently receives confirmation that the safe house fire occurred hours later than it was alleged to have. With this piece of information, Reardon becomes convinced that Colfax and Kitty set the Swede up from the beginning and were responsible for his murder.\n\nReardon goes to visit Colfax, now a successful building contractor in [[Pittsburgh]]. When confronted Colfax claims no knowledge of Kitty's whereabouts. Reardon lies, claiming he has enough evidence to convict Kitty. A short time later Reardon receives a phone call from Kitty, who suggests they meet at a nightclub. Once there they order food, and Kitty claims she convinced the Swede that the others were double-crossing him so he would take her away from Colfax. She then admits having taken the money after her meeting with the Swede in Atlantic City and agrees to offer Colfax as a fall guy to save herself, believing Reardon's revelation that he has evidence against her. While Kitty goes to the ladies' room to \"powder her nose\", Max and Al arrive at the nightclub and try to kill Reardon. Anticipating such a confrontation, Reardon and Lubinsky manage to slay both hitmen instead. When Reardon goes to get Kitty he discovers she has escaped through the bathroom window.\n\nReardon and Lubinsky depart the nightclub and head to Colfax's mansion. When they arrive they find that Dum-Dum and Colfax have mortally wounded each other in a violent shootout only moments before. Lubinsky asks Colfax, barely hanging on, why he had the Swede killed. Colfax finally admits to the contract, saying he feared other gang members would locate the Swede and realize that Colfax and Kitty had double-crossed them all and absconded with the money. Kitty, kneeling beside her husband, begs him to exonerate her in a [[deathbed confession]], but he dies first.\n\n==Cast==\n{{multiple image\n<!-- Essential parameters -->\n| align     = right\n| direction = vertical\n| width     = 225\n<!-- Image 1 -->\n| image1    = The-Killers-1946-McGraw-Conrad.jpg\n| alt1      =\n| caption1  = The killers ([[Charles McGraw]], [[William Conrad]])\n<!-- Image 2 -->\n| image2    =Thekillers2.jpg\n| alt2      =\n| caption2  = Lilly ([[Virginia Christine]]), the Swede ([[Burt Lancaster]]) and Kitty ([[Ava Gardner]])}}\n\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Burt Lancaster]] as Pete Lund/Ole \"Swede\" Anderson\n* [[Ava Gardner]] as Kitty Collins\n* [[Edmond O'Brien]] as Jim Reardon\n* [[Albert Dekker]] as \"Big Jim\" Colfax\n* [[Sam Levene]] as Lt.

The rest of the film, showing Reardon's investigation of the murder, is wholly original.\n\nProducer [[Mark Hellinger]] paid $36,750 for the screen rights to Hemingway's story, his first independent production. The screenplay was written by [[John Huston]] (uncredited because of his contract with [[Warner Bros.]]) and [[Richard Brooks]]. Siodmak later said Hellinger's newspaper background meant he \"always insisted on each scene ending with a punchline and every character being over established with a telling remark\" which the director fought against.<ref name=\"sight\">Encounter with Siodmak\nTaylor, Russell.

Hellinger alleged that he tested so many potential 'Swedes' that if somebody had suggested Garbo, he would have tested her too.<ref name=\"Swede\" />{{Rp|129}} Lancaster was under contract to producer [[Hal Wallis]] but had not yet appeared in a film. Wallis' assistant Martin Jurow told Hellinger about the then unknown \"big brawny bird\" who might be suitable for the role and Hellinger set up a meeting. After his screen test, Hellinger signed a contract with Lancaster to do one film a year and cast him in the role that would make him a star.<ref name=\"Swede\" />{{Rp|129}}\n\nIn the role of the ''[[femme fatale]]'', Hellinger cast Gardner, who had up to then appeared virtually unnoticed in a string of minor films under contract to [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]]. Gardner had difficulty achieving the requisite histrionics necessary at the end of the film when Sam Levene memorably tells her ''\"Don't ask a dying man to lie his soul into Hell.\"'' Director Siodmak felt she did not have the necessary technique to reach the emotional climax necessary for the scene so he chose to \"bully her\" into Kitty's fragile emotional state by ''\"barking at her if she did not do the scene right, he would hit her.\"''{{sfn|Server|2007|p=106}}\n\n==Release==\n===Critical response===\n[[File:Ava Gardner \u2212 The Killers (1946).jpg|right|thumb|Ava Gardner in ''The Killers'' (1946)]]\nWhen the film was first released, [[Bosley Crowther]] gave it a positive review and lauded the acting. He wrote, \"With Robert Siodmak's restrained direction, a new actor, Burt Lancaster, gives a lanky and wistful imitation of a nice guy who's wooed to his ruin. And Ava Gardner is sultry and sardonic as the lady who crosses him up. Edmond O'Brien plays the shrewd investigator in the usual cool and clipped detective style, Sam Levene is very good as a policeman and [[Albert Dekker]] makes a thoroughly nasty thug. ... The tempo is slow and metronomic, which makes for less excitement than suspense.\"<ref>[https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?_r=1&res=9807E4DF1338E53ABC4151DFBE66838D659EDE&oref=slogin Crowther, Bosley] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120806205649/http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?_r=1&res=9807E4DF1338E53ABC4151DFBE66838D659EDE&oref=slogin |date=2012-08-06 }}.

Last accessed: February 24, 2008</ref>\n\nIn a review of the [[DVD]] release, Scott Tobias, while critical of the screenplay, described the drama's ''noir'' style, writing, \"Lifted note-for-note from the Hemingway story, the classic opening scene of Siodmak's film sings with the high tension, sharp dialogue, and grim humor that's conspicuously absent from the rest of Anthony Veiller's mediocre screenplay. ... A lean block of muscles and little else, Burt Lancaster stars as the hapless victim, an ex-boxer who was unwittingly roped into the criminal underworld and the even more dangerous gaze of Ava Gardner, a memorably sultry and duplicitous ''femme fatale.'' ... [Siodmak] sustains a [[fatalism|fatalistic]] tone with the atmospheric touches that define ''noir'', favoring stark lighting effects that throw his post-war world into shadow.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.avclub.com/review/ernest-hemingways-the-killers-1946-12103|author=Tobias, Scott|work=[[The A.V.
