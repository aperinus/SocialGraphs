It is a remake of the 2003 [[Korean horror|South Korean horror]] film ''[[A Tale of Two Sisters]]'', which is in turn one of several film adaptations of the Korean folk tale [[Janghwa Hongryeon jeon]]. The film received mixed reviews.\n\n==Plot==\nFollowing a [[suicide attempt]] after her terminally ill mother died in a house fire, Anna Ivers is discharged from a [[psychiatric institution]] after ten months; she has [[Memory repression#Amnesia for trauma or abuse|no memory]] of the actual fire, though recurring nightmares from that night frequently plague her. Back at home, Anna reunites with her older sister Alex and comes to learn their father Steven has a new girlfriend, Rachel Summers, who had been their mother's [[live-in nurse]].\n\nAnna and Alex become convinced that Anna's nightmares are messages from their mother, telling them that Rachel murdered her so that she could be with Steven. The girls remain angry at Steven for moving their mother into the boathouse when she got sick, her only way of calling for help being a bell that Rachel tied to her wrist. Anna meets up with her old boyfriend Matt, who tells her he saw what happened the night her mother died, but Rachel intervenes before he can explain further.\n\nAnna goes with Rachel into town, so Alex can look through Rachel\u2019s possessions, and Anna can talk to Matt again. The two secretly plan to meet that night but Matt fails to show up. Anna has a ghastly hallucination of him and, the next morning, his dead body is pulled out of the water, his back broken. The police state he fell from his boat and drowned.\n\nAfter the sisters are unable to find a record of Rachel with the [[List of nursing organizations#State Nursing Boards|State Nursing Association]], they conclude she is actually Mildred Kemp, a nanny who killed the children she was taking care of after she became obsessed with their widowed father. While Steven is away on business, the girls try to gather evidence against Rachel to show the police, but Rachel catches them and sedates Alex. Anna escapes and goes to the local police station, but they do not believe her and eventually call Rachel to take her home.\n\nRachel sedates Anna and puts her to bed; Anna sees Alex in the doorway with a knife before passing out. When she wakes up, she finds that Alex has killed Rachel and thrown her body in a dumpster in their backyard. When Steven arrives home, Anna explains that Rachel tried to murder them and Alex saved them. Confused and panicked, Steven asks what Anna is talking about: Alex had died in the fire along with their mother. Anna looks down to find that the bloody knife is in her hand. She then finally remembers what happened on the night of the fire: after catching Steven and Rachel having sex, she became enraged, filled a watering can from a gasoline tank in the boathouse, and carried it toward the house, intending to burn it down. However, she didn't fully close the faucet and it spilt a trail of gasoline that ignited when a lantern fell. Her mother was killed in the resulting explosion, as was Alex.\n\nFlashbacks reveal that Anna had been hallucinating Alex since she left the institution, which is why no one else had ever responded to Alex's dialogues. She also remembers killing Matt, who showed up at their planned meeting by letting him fall off a cliff and break his back because he revealed he saw what Anna had done. She finally remembers killing Rachel, who wasn't actually a murderer but a kind woman trying to make the family work; she had sedated Anna to try and keep her safe.\n\nThe next morning as Anna is arrested for murder, the police question Steven, who reveals that Rachel changed her last name three years ago to escape an abusive ex-boyfriend. When Anna returns to the mental institution, she is welcomed back by the patient who lives in the room across from hers, whose nameplate reveals she is the real Mildred Kemp.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Emily Browning]] as Anna Ivers\n* [[Elizabeth Banks]] as Rachel Summers\n* [[Arielle Kebbel]] as Alex Ivers\n* [[David Strathairn]] as Steven Ivers\n* [[Jesse Moss (actor)|Jesse Moss]] as Matt\n* [[Kevin McNulty (actor)|Kevin McNulty]] as Sheriff Emery\n* [[Don S.

Parkes]] and [[Laurie MacDonald]] produced the hit horror film ''[[The Ring (2002 film)|The Ring]]'', a remake of the Japanese film ''[[Ring (film)|Ring]]''. They subsequently produced the film's successful [[sequel]] ''[[The Ring Two]]'' in 2005. Since first starting this new cycle of Asian horror film adaptations, Parkes and MacDonald searched for a project they felt was as ingeniously conceived and executed as ''The Ring'', and finally found it when producer [[Roy Lee]] brought the Korean film ''[[A Tale of Two Sisters]]'' to their attention.\n\nWhen ''A Tale of Two Sisters'' played in US theatres, directors Tom and Charlie Guard had acquired the [[English language]] remake rights. The Guard Brothers had previously directed commercials and short films, and wanted to expand into feature films.\n\nIn June 2006, DreamWorks announced that a deal had been set up for the US version of ''A Tale of Two Sisters''. The new film was a presentation of DreamWorks and Cold Spring Pictures (''[[Disturbia (film)|Disturbia]]''), and was produced by Parkes, MacDonald and Lee. The screenplay was written by Craig Rosenberg (''[[After the Sunset]]'', ''[[Lost (TV series)|Lost]]''), [[Doug Miro]] and Carlo Bernard (''[[The Great Raid]]'').<ref>Scifi Japan(December 26, 2007).

Most of the film was shot at one location, a waterfront property on [[British Columbia]]'s [[Bowen Island]], a short ferry ride west from [[Metro Vancouver|mainland Vancouver]].\n\nProducer [[Walter F. Parkes]] said, of the shooting location:\n{{cquote|''Eighty percent of the story takes place at the house, so we couldn't make the movie without the right one. It couldn't have been more important. We scouted [[Louisiana]], an environment which is both beautiful and slightly threatening. We had two houses which were terrible compromises, but both of them fell through. We had a difficult time finding anything that had both the connection to the story and the right logistical possibilities.''\n\n''But then we were lucky to find in [[Canada]] a place that seemed as if it had been built for our movie. It was perfectly evocative and suggestive of a family that is both welcoming and forbidding. The fact that the house was within 30 miles of Vancouver was a greater plus than the minus of having to get everyone on boats to get them over there; water taxis and ferries are a way of life up there. In fact, I don\u2019t remember ever having a more pleasant time on a location. Getting onto a boat and having a cup of coffee and then going up the little pier and the stairs we built, it focused us. We were isolated with one thing on our minds, which was making this movie. It was great.''<ref>Scifi Japan (December 26, 2008). \"[http://www.scifijapan.com/articles/2008/12/26/a-tale-of-two-sisters-remake-becomes-the-uninvited-for-2009-release/ The Perfect House].\" ''Scifi Japan''.
