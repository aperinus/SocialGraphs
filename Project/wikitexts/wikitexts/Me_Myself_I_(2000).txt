It was the first feature film by director [[Pip Karmel]], and was released and reviewed internationally.\n\n==Plot==\nPamela Drury is single and works as a serious journalist. She spends her birthday alone and becomes lonely and reflects upon her life and the choices she made and secretly wishes she had gotten married and had children. In a box of photos of old boyfriends, she reflects upon why she broke up with one in particular, Robert Dickson, 13 years earlier. She also meets an interesting man, Ben and follows him home, only to see through his window that he is with his family and looks very happy. Shortly afterwards, she is hit by a car while crossing the street.\n\nThe woman who was driving the car is ''also'' Pamela, but is Pamela ''Dickson''; she is from an alternate universe in which she married Robert 13 years earlier. Pamela Dickson takes Pamela Drury to the Dickson family home and the two of them talk in the kitchen. Suddenly, Pamela Dickson's kids come home and she disappears, leaving the unmarried Pamela Drury in a house she has never seen before with three children she does not know. The children assume she is their mother, although they do not quite recognize her sometimes.\n\nShe soon finds out that her alternate version Pamela Dickson lives in a dull marriage and writes lightweight fluff articles for a mainstream ladies magazine, rather than being the serious reporter that Drury is. She meets Ben again, but in this time-line he was never married and still mourns the loss of the great love of his life, who was killed just before their graduation from college.\n\nAt first, Pamela Drury was pleased to be with Robert again after all these years apart, but she is soon unhappy and annoyed with married life, and quarrels with Robert. She embarks on an affair with Ben, not mentioning to him that she has a husband and kids (because she still doesn't think of herself as married or a mother). Ben visits her and learns the truth, and walks away angry and disappointed. Soon, Pamela Drury embraces having a family and falls for Robert again, and even stimulates him and enlivens her marriage. Then when Pamela Drury is in a restaurant bathroom, Pamela Dickson shows up again, and the two women switch back to their former lives. Pamela Dickson had been living the life of single Pamela Drury and enjoyed it but ultimately missed her husband and kids so she came back. Pamela Drury is single once more and embraces her life with a new appreciation of all that being single and having a career has to offer. She learns that while she was gone, Pamela Dickson began dating Ben, who actually is divorced from the woman she saw through the window, the same woman who alternate-Ben had thought was his soul mate. Ultimately she sees that both lives are appealing and offer a lot to appreciate.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Rachel Griffiths]] as Pamela Drury / Pamela Dickson\n*[[David Roberts (Australian actor)|David Roberts]] as Robert Dickson\n*[[Sandy Winton]] as Ben Monroe\n*[[Yael Stone]] as Stacy Dickson\n*[[Shaun Loseby]] as Douglas Dickson\n*[[Trent Sullivan]] as Rupert Dickson\n*[[Christine Stephen-Daly]] as Deirdre\n*[[Felix Williamson]] as Geoff\n*[[Rebecca Frith]] as Terri\n*[[Ann Burbrook]] as Janinie\n*[[Frank Whitten]] as Charlie\n*[[Terence Crawford]] as Allen\n*[[Maeliosa Stafford]] as Max\n*[[Kirstie Hutton]] as Sally\n*[[Peter Brailey]] as Roger\n*[[Mariel McClorey]] as Harriet\n*[[Andrew Caryofyllis]] as Harry\n*[[Lenore Munro]] as Sophie\n*[[Lisa Belfiore]] as Molly\n*[[Lyndon Wilkinson]] as Pamela's Mother (voice on phone)\n*[[Spud (canine actor)|Spud]] as Brandy the dog\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Critical response===\nThe film was mainly seen in Australia, but was internationally distributed and widely reviewed.<ref>{{rotten-tomatoes|me_myself_i|Me Myself I}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Ebert |first=Roger |authorlink=Roger Ebert |title=Me Myself I |date=21 April 2000 |url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20000421/REVIEWS/4210305/1023 |work=The Chicago Sun Times}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Holden |first=Stephen |authorlink=Stephen Holden |title=Me Myself I (1999) - FILM REVIEW; Oh, It's a Wonderful Life!

And Ms. Griffiths, as in many of her other roles, conveys fine, high-strung intelligence beneath a slightly chilly exterior. Mr. Roberts and Mr. Winton bring just the right romantic ardor to their roles. But for its comic warmth, ''Me Myself I'' isn't much more than a Cosmo girl's daydream, one in which an appreciative fail-safe Prince Charming is conveniently posted at every junction.}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Critic Reviews for Me Myself I |publisher=Metacritic |url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/me-myself-i/critic-reviews }}</ref> [[Roger Ebert]] and other critics have emphasized [[Rachel Griffiths]]' performance in the lead, but [[Andrew Sarris]] noted in ''The New York Observer'', \"In any event, Ms. Karmel, whether as erstwhile writer, editor, or maker of short films, has earned the right to a long and fruitful directorial career on the strength of ''Me Myself I'', one of the most striking feature-film debuts ever.\"<ref name=Sarris>{{cite news |title=Station Wagon Fender Bender is Rachel Griffiths' Big Break |last=Sarris |first=Andrew |authorlink=Andrew Sarris |url=http://www.observer.com/node/42805 |work=The New York Observer |date=9 April 2000}}</ref>\n\n===Awards===\nThe film won two awards for sound at the [[Australian Screen Sound Guild]] awards and won First Works Section at the [[Festroia International Film Festival]].<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.imdb.com/event/ev0000239/2000 | title=Festr\u00f3ia - Tr\u00f3ia International Film Festival | year=2000 | publisher=IMDb | accessdate=10 May 2010 }}</ref> It was nominated for the [[Australian Film Institute Award for Best Direction]], [[Australian Film Institute Award for Best Screenplay|Best Screenplay]], [[Australian Film Institute Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role|Best Actress in a Leading Role]] and [[Australian Film Institute Award for Best Achievement in Editing|Best Achievement in Editing]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Me Myself I (1999) - Awards |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0183503/awards |publisher=IMDb |accessdate=18 January 2011}}</ref>\n\n===Box office===\n''Me Myself I'' grossed $2,698,330 at the box office in Australia,<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://film.vic.gov.au/resources/documents/AA4_Aust_Box_office_report.pdf |title=''Film Victoria - Australian Films at the Australian Box Office'' |access-date=22 November 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110218045303/http://film.vic.gov.au/resources/documents/AA4_Aust_Box_office_report.pdf |archive-date=18 February 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref> and about $370,000 in the U.S.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=memyselfi.htm |title=Me Myself I (2000) |work=Box Office Mojo }}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Cinema of Australia]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|0183503|Me Myself I}}\n* {{allmovie|181320|Me Myself I}}\n*[https://www.ozmovies.com.au/movie/me-myself-i Me Myself I] at Oz Movies\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Me Myself I (Film)}}\n[[Category:2000 films]]\n[[Category:Australian romantic comedy films]]\n[[Category:2000 romantic comedy films]]\n[[Category:2000s fantasy-comedy films]]\n[[Category:2000s English-language films]]"}]}}}}
