Starring [[Kim Basinger]], [[Gabriel Byrne]] and [[Brad Pitt]], it tells the story of a [[cartoonist]] who finds himself in the animated world he thinks he created, but has actually existed long before. In this world, he is seduced by one of the characters, a [[femme fatale]] who wants to become human.<ref>{{cite book |last=Lenburg |first=Jeff |title=The Encyclopedia of Animated Cartoons |date=1999 |publisher=Checkmark Books |isbn=0-8160-3831-7 |access-date=6 June 2020 |url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780816038312/page/174/mode/2up |page=174}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the success of ''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]]'' and his own professional resurgence in television in the late 1980s, Bakshi conceived the film as a live-action/animated [[horror film]]. He brought the idea to [[Paramount Pictures]], and became attached to direct; it was his first feature film in nearly a decade. The film was intended as his comeback, however, interference from producer [[Frank Mancuso Jr.]] led to an extensive rewrite from [[Michael Grais,]] [[Mark Victor,]] and an uncredited [[Larry Gross]] changing the film from adult-oriented horror to more of an adolescent comedy-fantasy. As a result, relations between Bakshi, Mancuso, and the studio deteriorated, and the film had a highly tumultuous production.\n\n''Cool World'' was released by Paramount on July 10, 1992. Upon its release, the film was a critical and commercial failure. Critics panned the film for its story, acting, animation, and effects combining animation with the live-action footage; however, the soundtrack and visuals received praise. The film was also a [[box-office bomb|box office bomb]], grossing $14 million against a budget of $28 million.\n\nDespite appearing on several lists of the [[List of films considered the worst#Cool World (1992)|worst films ever made]], ''Cool World'' developed a [[cult following]] and has been described as a [[cult film|cult classic]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.dazeddigital.com/artsandculture/article/33257/1/what-makes-cult-film-cool-world-so-universally-hated |title=What makes cult film Cool World so universally hated? |date=October 7, 2016 |access-date=October 24, 2022 |publisher=Dazed |last=Taylor |first=Trey}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films are 400 to 700 words. -->\nIn 1945 [[Las Vegas]], [[World War II]] veteran Frank Harris returns to his mother and invites her to a ride on his motorcycle. The two are involved in a traffic collision where Frank's mother dies. Afterwards, Frank is inadvertently transported to a [[cartoon]]-like alternate universe called the \"Cool World\", where he restarts his life as a detective for Cool World's local police department.\n\nForty-seven years later, underground cartoonist Jack Deebs is being released from a ten-year prison sentence for the murder of a man he found in bed with his wife. During his sentence, he created a series of comics called Cool World based on recurring visions of his, prominently featuring [[femme fatale]] Holli Would. Holli's wish is to escape Cool World and become a real person, which is possible when \"doodles\" (slang for Cool World's inhabitants) have [[sexual intercourse]] with \"noids\" (slang for humans). However, Frank and his partner Nails, a doodle, keep a vigilant eye on Holli to ensure that the two dimensions do not intertwine.\n\nShortly after his release, Jack is transported into Cool World and smuggled into a local nightclub by Holli and her henchmen. Frank aggressively confronts Jack, explaining that Cool World has existed long before he created his series. He also warns him that [[Writing implement|writing utensils]], such as his [[fountain pen]], are lethal to the doodles; and to abstain from having sex with Holli, as her transforming into a noid can be dangerous for both dimensions. Despite these warnings, Frank himself is in love with another doodle, Lonette, but limits himself to platonic advances. Jack succumbs to Holli's advances, and she makes love to him, which transforms her into a noid. Holli steals Jack's pen to entrap Nails, and leaves with Jack for the real world.\n\nIn the real world, Holli finds herself excited and overwhelmed experiencing real sensations. Due to her presence there, she and Jack spontaneously flicker in between noid and doodle forms. While contemplating their situation, Holli tells Jack about the \"Spike of Power\", an artifact which was the cause of Frank being transported into Cool World and placed on top of the [[Plaza Hotel & Casino|Union Plaza Hotel]] by a doodle who crossed into the real world, and admits she wants to use it to remain in her noid form permanently. When Jack displays skepticism about the idea, Holli abandons him to search for the spike on her own.\n\nFrank learns what has happened and returns to the real world, where he reluctantly teams up with Jack in a bid to stop Holli despite hostility between one another. They arrive at the hotel as Holli begins to climb to the top of the tower. In his pursuit, Frank is pushed off the building to his death by Holli. As she seizes the spike, she releases a multitude of monstrous doodles into the real world, affecting her surroundings. The Spike also transforms Jack into a superhero-like doodle, and in the ensuing chaos, frees Nails from the pen.\n\nAlthough enticed to ignore and begin a new life in the real world with Holli, Jack returns the Spike to its rightful place, sending him, Holli and the invading doodles back from whence the creatures came and restoring the balance between their dimensions. Nails brings Frank's body back to Cool World, where he and Lonette mourn his loss. However, as she finds out from Nails that Holli was briefly in her doodle form when she killed Frank, she explains that a noid killed by a doodle in the real world can be reborn as a doodle in Cool World. Frank is transformed into a doodle, allowing him to continue his relationship with Lonette. Jack and Holli, permanently in doodle form, are last seen as Jack begins planning their new life together, much to Holli's dismay.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Kim Basinger]] as Holli Would, a femme fatale doodle who wishes to become a noid and live in the real world.

The cartoonist would go on to have [[sexual intercourse]] with a [[femme fatale]] \"doodle\" named \"Debbie Dallas (a play on the title of the pornographic film, \"Debbie Does Dallas\")\" and father a hybrid child with her; half-cartoon, and half-human. The child, growing up resenting its father for abandoning it, would grow up and go on to make a pilgrimage to the real world to try to hunt down its father and kill him. Ralph pitched the idea as an live-action/animated [[horror film]] to [[Paramount Pictures]], where he had served as the final head of the studio's [[Famous Studios|animation division]] some years earlier.<ref name=\"NYT\">{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/07/05/movies/film-animation-s-bad-boy-returns-unrepentant.html |title=Animation's Bad Boy Returns, Unrepentant |access-date=March 21, 2007|last=Diamond |first=Jamie |date=July 5, 1991 |work=[[The New York Times]] |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref name=\"Gibson-McDonnell-219\">{{cite book |last1=Gibson |first1=Jon M. |last2=McDonnell |first2=Chris |title=Unfiltered: The Complete Ralph Bakshi |year=2008 |publisher=Universe Publishing |isbn=978-0-7893-1684-4 |pages=219; 227 |chapter=Ups & Downs }}</ref> Bakshi stated that Paramount Pictures \"bought the idea in ten seconds.\"<ref name=\"IGN\">{{cite web |url=http://filmforce.ign.com/articles/518/518805p1.html |title=Interview with Ralph Bakshi |access-date=January 10, 2007 |website=[[IGN]] |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060218211315/http://filmforce.ign.com/articles/518/518805p1.html |archive-date=February 18, 2006 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> In addition to Bakshi himself writing his own screenplay going off of his concept, [[Michael Grais]] and [[Mark Victor,]] along with an uncredited [[Larry Gross]] wrote several drafts of the screenplay based on Bakshi's original concept.
