The film co-stars [[Kate Beckinsale]] as his wife Donna and [[Christopher Walken]] as Morty, an eccentric stranger and apparent inventor. Sandler plays Michael Newman, an overworked [[architect]] who neglects his family when he acquires a magical [[universal remote]] from Morty that enables him to control reality. \n\nFilming began in late 2005 and was finished by early 2006. ''Click'' was released in the United States on June 23, 2006, by [[Columbia Pictures]]. It was made on a budget of $82.5{{nbsp}}million, and grossed $240.7{{nbsp}}million. Upon release, it received mixed reviews from critics, although it was nominated for [[Academy Award for Best Makeup and Hairstyling|Best Makeup]] at the [[79th Academy Awards]] (it lost the award to ''[[Pan's Labyrinth]]''). This makes ''Click'' the only Sandler-produced film (as of 2022) to be nominated for an [[Academy Award]].\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films are 400 to 700 words. -->\nMichael Newman is an architect who is consistently bullied by his overbearing boss, John Ammer, and often chooses work over his wife Donna and his two children, Ben and Samantha. One day, Michael visits the retail store [[Bed Bath & Beyond]] to buy a universal remote control. He stumbles around the various departments before falling asleep. Upon waking, he accepts a free remote control from a man named Morty, who warns him that it can never be returned.\n\nMichael learns that the remote can be used to control reality much like a television. He uses it to his advantage at work, to cause light-hearted mischief, and to fast-forward past illnesses. Morty tells Michael that during these times, his body is on \"auto-pilot\", going through his motions of everyday life while his mind skips ahead.\n\nThinking that Ammer has promoted him to a partnership, Michael buys bicycles for his children and a purse for Donna. However, Ammer tells him that he has not yet been promoted and thus cannot afford the gifts and has to return them. Angry that he upset his family, Michael uses the remote to skip ahead to his promotion, thus missing a year of his life. During this time, he and Donna have entered marriage counseling, his children have matured, and the family dog has died. The remote, having learned his preferences, starts time-skipping automatically. Each time Michael attempts to discard or destroy the remote, it reappears, and Morty refuses to take it back.\n\nAt work, Ammer tells Michael he plans on retiring, which would make Michael the new head of the International Division and that in time, Michael could be promoted to CEO. This causes the remote to instantly fast-forward ten years into the future, where Michael is extremely wealthy, but morbidly obese and lives alone in a luxury apartment. He returns home to discover that Ben, now overweight like himself, and Samantha have both become moody teenagers, and that Donna has divorced him and remarried to Bill, Ben's former childhood swim coach. When he argues with them, the new family dog jumps on Michael and knocks him into a coma. The remote time-skips six years to when Michael wakes, no longer obese as a result of having undergone [[liposuction]] to save his life as a part of his [[cancer]] treatment and subsequent [[heart attack]]. A full-grown Ben is now a partner at the firm.\n\nMichael learns that his father, Ted, has died of old age. Morty reappears as Michael mourns him. Michael uses the remote to see when he last saw Ted, when Michael coldly rebuffed Ted's offer to take him and Ben out to dinner. At Ted's grave, Morty appears and reveals to Michael that he is the [[Death (personification)|Angel of Death]]. Overcome with guilt and shame, Michael asks to go to a \"good place\", whereupon the remote fast-forwards him several more years in the future to Ben's wedding. He overhears Samantha refer to Bill as Dad, triggering a second heart attack. He wakes in the hospital that night to find his family there, including Ben, who reveals that he skipped his honeymoon to help fix issues with the firm, before a nurse makes Ben and Samantha leave. Fearing that Ben will make the same mistakes he did, Michael gathers the last of his strength to follow them out of the hospital but he collapses and subsequently dies, but not before telling Ben to put his wife before work, and assures his family that he still loves them.\n \nMichael reawakens in Bed Bath & Beyond and finds that he was dreaming but see it as a sign that he needs to make changes in his life. He embraces his family and promises to spend more time with them. He finds the remote on the counter along with a note from Morty, who reveals he has given him a second chance because \"Good guys need a break.\" Michael throws the remote in the trash and, much to his delight, it does not reappear. He then engages his family in a pillow fight.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Adam Sandler]] as Michael Newman\n** Emilio Cast as 10-year-old Michael Newman\n* [[Kate Beckinsale]] as Donna Newman, Michael's wife\n* [[Christopher Walken]] as Morty, the Angel of Death\n* [[David Hasselhoff]] as John Ammer, Michael's overbearing boss\n* [[Henry Winkler]] as Ted, Michael's father\n* [[Julie Kavner]] as Trudy, Michael's mother\n* [[Sean Astin]] as Bill, Ben's swimming coach and Donna's second husband in the alternative timeline\n* [[Sally Insul]] as Aunt Peggy\n* [[Joseph Castanon]] as 7-year-old Ben, Michael's son\n** [[Jonah Hill]] as 17-year-old Ben\n** [[Jake Hoffman (actor)|Jake Hoffman]] as 22-30-year-old Ben\n* Danielle Tatum McCann as 5-year-old Samantha, Michael's daughter\n** [[Lorraine Nicholson]] as 14-year-old Samantha\n** [[Katie Cassidy]] as 27-year-old Samantha\n* [[Cameron Monaghan]] as Kevin O'Doyle, Michael's obnoxious 10-year-old next-door neighbor\n* [[Jennifer Coolidge]] as Janine, Donna's neurotic best friend, whom Michael detests\n* [[Rachel Dratch]] as Alice/Alan, Michael's assistant\n* [[Sophie Monk]] as Stacey\n* [[Michelle Lombardo]] as Linda\n* [[Jana Kramer]] as Julie, 22-30-year-old Ben's wife-to-be\n* [[Nick Swardson]] as a Bed, Bath & Beyond Guy\n* [[Frank Coraci]] as a Male Nurse\n* [[Rob Schneider]] as Prince Habeeboo (uncredited)<ref name=screenworld2007 />\n* [[James Earl Jones]] as himself / Narrator (voice only, uncredited)<ref name=screenworld2007>{{cite book| title=Screen World Volume 58: The Films of 2006 |year= 2010| first1=John| last1=Willis|first2= Barry, eds.| last2= Monush | publisher=Applause Theatre & Cinema Books | isbn=978-1557837295 |page= [https://books.google.com/books?id=uxunSeshPngC&pg=PA74&q=%22james%20earl%20jones%22%20click%20%22screen%20world%22 74]}}</ref>\n* [[Terry Crews]] as Man singing in car (uncredited)\n* [[Dolores O'Riordan]] as Singer <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hotpress.com/music/dolores-oriordan-makes-silver-screen-debut-2864504|title=Dolores O'Riordan makes silver screen debut|date=15 May 2006|url-status=live|archive-url=https://archive.today/20200427181853/https://www.hotpress.com/music/dolores-oriordan-makes-silver-screen-debut-2864504|archive-date=April 27, 2020|access-date=27 April 2020}}</ref>\n}}\n\n==Production==\nOn July 23, 2003, Sony purchased [[Steve Koren]] and Mark O'Keefe's [[spec script]], named ''Click'', for $1.75 million with plans for it to be an [[Adam Sandler]] film produced by [[Revolution Studios]], [[Columbia Pictures]], and [[Neal H.
