The tale centers on Harry, a [[freelancer]] who spends a great deal of time with his beloved female pup, Jolly. Owing a group of people a large amount of money for refusing to do them a favor, he plans to leave town to avoid the debt. One day when he returns home, Jolly is found dead. Stricken with grief and anger, Harry enlists the help of his close cousin Cecil to find Jolly's murderer, dragging him through a path of destruction.\n\nAt a bar, they interrogate a rude bartender, Thomas, getting a lead on a man named Bachmeier, a regular visitor and suspect who was given Harry's address upon request. Harry snaps and shoots Thomas dead for that reason. Next, they track down known prostitute, Tina, who was recently seen with Bachmeier. Refusing to pay her for sex and written info, Cecil is shot by Tina in the hand with a gun, but Tina joins her friend Vicki in death when Harry shoots them, as he grows overly vengeful.\n\nThe following stop takes Harry and Cecil to a law firm office, where they confront and wipe out three unscrupulous lawyers, Bobby, Eichelberger and Danny, for withholding info. The receptionist eventually tells them Bachmeier is at a wedding reception. There, Harry and Cecil show up uninvited and hold the people hostage, although Bachmeier is not present and his sister, Angela, informs them that her family is dysfunctional. After killing many people in attendance, assaulting Angela and shooting her husband, Gary, a man soon gives them Bachmeier's address.\n\nThe film returns to the beginning. Harry pulls up at a house, leaving Cecil in his car to approach an armed Bachmeier at his front door. Harry blames him for Jolly's death, and Bachmeier invites him in like nothing is wrong. The final image shows two shots fired inside the house, though it is only seen from a distance on the outside.\n\n==Cast==\n* Brian Petsos as Harry Dennis\n* [[Oscar Isaac]] as Cecil \n* [[Elijah Wood]] as Thomas \n* [[Ryan Phillippe]] as Everett Bachmeier \n* [[Kristen Wiig]] as Angela \n* [[Adam Brody]] as Danny Fidazzo\n* [[Gillian Jacobs]] as Tina \n* [[Bobby Moynihan]] as Bobby Fidazzo\n* [[Kevin Corrigan]] as Tony \n* [[David Rasche]] as Eichelberger \n* [[Garret Dillahunt]] as Gary \n* [[Amy Seimetz]] as Vicki \n* [[Jayne Atkinson]] as Receptionist \n* [[Brad Morris]] as Dale \n* [[Steve Payne (actor)|Steve Payne]] as Gene\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Official website|http://www.revengeforjolly.com/}}\n* {{IMDb title|2053423}}\n* {{Rotten Tomatoes|revenge_for_jolly}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Revenge For Jolly!}}\n[[Category:2012 films]]\n[[Category:2012 comedy-drama films]]\n[[Category:2012 independent films]]\n[[Category:American comedy-drama films]]\n[[Category:American films about revenge]]\n[[Category:American independent films]]\n[[Category:Films shot in New York City]]\n[[Category:2010s English-language films]]\n[[Category:2010s American films]]"}]}}}}
