The film marks the [[List of directorial debuts|directorial debut]] of cinematographer [[Dean Cundey]] and was released through [[Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment|Walt Disney Home Video]] as a [[direct-to-video|direct-to-home video]] film. The plot tells the story of inventor Wayne Szalinski as he accidentally shrinks himself, his wife, brother, and sister-in-law with his electromagnetic shrink ray.\n\n[[Rick Moranis]] returns as Wayne Szalinski, and is the only cast member from the previous films to reprise their role. [[Eve Gordon]] replaces [[Marcia Strassman]] as Diane Szalinski, and their youngest son Adam, now a pre-teen, is played by [[Bug Hall]]. Wayne and Diane's two older children, Amy and Nick, do not appear but are mentioned as having gone away to college and living adult lives. The cast includes Wayne's extended family, including his brother, Gordon, sister-in-law Patti (mentioned in the first film when Diane was on the phone with her looking for Amy), and niece and nephew Jenny and Mitch.\n\nThe film is also the first [[Walt Disney Pictures]] live-action direct-to-video release, and stands as Moranis' most recent live-action film role, though he would continue to do voice-acting for the next several years. The franchise continued with a [[Honey, I Shrunk the Kids: The TV Show|television series]] adaptation, which aired on [[broadcast syndication]].\n\nThe film series will continue with the soft reboot ''[[Shrunk (film)|Shrunk]]'', which will see [[Josh Gad]] play Nick Szalinski, and Moranis will come out of his semi-retirement to reprise the role of Wayne. [[Joe Johnston]] (who directed the first film) will also return to direct the sequel.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://variety.com/2019/film/news/honey-i-shrunk-the-kids-reboot-josh-gad-joe-johnston-1203425344/|title='Honey, I Shrunk the Kids' Director in Talks to Return for Reboot Starring Josh Gad (EXCLUSIVE)|date=5 December 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2020/02/honey-i-shrunk-the-kids-reboot-rick-moranis-1202858344/|title=Rick Moranis Closes Deal to Return to 'Honey, I Shrunk the Kids' Franchise with 'Shrunk' at Disney|date=12 February 2020}}</ref> The film will be a [[Disney+]] release.\n\n==Plot==\nEight years after the events of the [[Honey, I Blew Up the Kid|previous film]], ten-year-old Adam wants to go to baseball camp. However, his interest in sports seems almost alien to Wayne, although Diane is more understanding. Wayne has started his own lab, Szalinski Labs, with his brother, Gordon. One day, they receive tickets to witness a shuttle landing, but Diane reminds him over the phone that he needs to watch Adam and his cousins, Jenny and Mitch, while she and Gordon's wife Patti go on vacation. She also reminds him to get rid of a Tiki Man sculpture they keep in the house that she sees as an eyesore, though he considers it a good luck charm.\n\nAfter Diane and Patti leave, Wayne and Gordon have activities planned that bore the kids. Wayne sends them to the store, but reveals to Gordon that it is a ruse to get rid of them long enough so that he can use his shrinking machine in order to shrink the Tiki Man without Diane's knowledge, and spare any accidents with the kids.  However, after carelessly not turning it off immediately after they succeed, Wayne and Gordon are shrunk when a billiard ball left on it falls onto the activating button, just as they are in front of it searching for the Tiki Man. Meanwhile, Patti realizes she forgot to leave Mitch's medicine for his [[hypokalemia|potassium deficiency]], and they head back. Hoping to catch Wayne and Gordon by surprise, they sneak up to the attic only to be shrunk when another billiard ball falls onto the activating button. Shortly after, the kids return home, and after hearing Wayne's previous message about the launch, assume they are alone for the evening.  Jenny makes plans to have her friends come over. Upstairs, the adults make use of a fishing rod to lower themselves down into Adam's room. To attempt to get to the floor, they use his [[Hot Wheels]] race track, but they overshoot their target and fall down the [[laundry chute]] ending up in a clean load that is delivered back upstairs by Adam and Mitch. They tumble out of the laundry basket when it is overturned, and discover Adam and Mitch reading a ''[[Sports Illustrated Kids<!--\"Kids\" per WP:MOSTM-->]]'' magazine, revealing to Wayne that Adam's interest is not in science as he hoped. The four suddenly encounter a cockroach, but manage to defeat it by luring it into a bug trap.\n\nSeeing Mitch struggling, Patti realizes that they need to get him his medicine soon, or he could pass out. He ignores his weaknesses, though, and goes downstairs. The adults witness the arrival of Jenny's friends and decide to use a bubble machine in order to get downstairs. Diane and Patti land safely, but Wayne and Gordon fall into a bowl of onion dip and are nearly devoured by the girls.\n\nIn the kitchen, when Patti and Diane resolve to find a way up the counter in order to find Mitch's medicine and push it into view, they encounter a [[Opiliones|daddy long-legs]] with its leg caught in a spider web, and Diane quietly talks to it as Patti tries to cut the web with a nail file. Diane realizes her own insecurities about being small as she relates to it, which she had earlier tried to kill, and realizes how hard it is to be that size. After it's freed, Patti and Diane realize they can cling to its silk as it climbs up onto the counter. Meanwhile, Wayne and Gordon decide to rewire the stereo to work as a microphone. A group of boys begin to crash the party, including Jenny's crush, Ricky King. He takes her into the kitchen, where he steals a kiss from her, but she spurns him for not asking permission first, thus earning Patti's respect. Angered, he returns to his friends and they begin to wreak havoc in the living room. Mitch, severely weakened, enters the kitchen and discovers Patti and Diane on the counter before fainting, partially from his failure to take his medicine, and partially from the shock of seeing his miniature mother and aunt. Adam and Jenny discover him, and thinking quickly, Adam gets potassium-rich bananas to give to him, and he begins to recover, weakly saying he had seen his mother. In the living room, Adam stands up to Ricky before Wayne rewires the stereo so that Gordon can talk and amplify his voice. With this, he pretends to be the voice of [[God]] and orders Ricky and his friends to leave, leading Adam, Mitch, and Jenny to realize what has happened to them.\n\nIn the attic, the kids discuss the benefits of leaving their parents shrunk briefly before deciding they love them more than that, so they unshrink them to give them a chance to re-evaluate their parenting methods. Patti confides her trust in Jenny for how she stood up to Ricky and took care of Mitch, while Wayne tells Adam that he can have an interest in sports, and agrees to sign him up for baseball camp. Diane tells Wayne he can keep the Tiki Man, and won't sweat the \"small\" stuff anymore, while he decides to relinquish his presidency of Szalinski Labs to Gordon and return to inventing. In the end, life is back to normal again. Adam returns home from baseball camp, and Wayne has developed a new respect for baseball, and the Tiki Man has been moved into the backyard and enlarged to twice the height of the house.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Rick Moranis]] as Wayne Szalinski.

[[Karey Kirkpatrick]] was called in to write the script, while working on ''[[James and the Giant Peach (film)|James and the Giant Peach]]''. The finished script was sent in to [[Jeffrey Katzenberg]], who decided that the studio did not want to continue with the film. It was shelved for a few months while Kirkpatrick resumed work on ''James and the Giant Peach''. While working on it, Kirkpatrick learned that it was going to be picked up again.\n\n[[The Walt Disney Company]] at the time was having success with releasing direct-to-video sequels, such as ''[[The Return of Jafar]]'' and ''[[Aladdin and the King of Thieves]]''. They wanted to test how live-action sequels would do, so they picked this one to be their first.\n\n[[Nell Scovell]] and [[Joel Hodgson]] were recruited to try to reduce Kirkpatrick's script due to the budget restraint. In Kirkpatrick's script, the group of shrunken parents would originally fall into an aquarium. The scene was cut from the script, and then revised to the bubble machine one. One scene shows one of Wayne's inventions, a machine that translates dog barks to human speech. It is similar to the devices in the \"invention exchange\" Hodgson did when with ''[[Mystery Science Theater 3000]]''.\n\n===Casting===\n[[Rick Moranis]] was the only actor from the first two films to reprise his role. [[Marcia Strassman]], who portrayed Diane in the first two films and in the 3D film, did not return and was replaced by [[Eve Gordon]], best known for portraying as [[Marilyn Monroe]] in ''[[A Woman Named Jackie]]''.\n\n[[Amy O'Neill]] and [[Robert Oliveri]], who had previously played Wayne's children Amy and Nick, had quit acting by the time the film was released; their characters were only mentioned in a conversation between Diane and Adam. Daniel and Joshua Shalikar, the twin actors who portrayed Adam in ''[[Honey, I Blew Up the Kid]]'', had signed on for two additional sequels in 1992. They had reprised their role in ''[[Honey, I Shrunk the Audience]]'', but [[Bug Hall]] replaced them in the part.\n\n[[Stuart Pankin]] and [[Robin Bartlett]] were cast as Gordon and Patti Szalinski. [[Allison Mack]] and [[Jake Richardson]] were cast as their kids, Jenny and Mitch. Mack would later become famous as [[Chloe Sullivan]] on ''[[Smallville]]''. Two of Jenny's friends are portrayed by [[Mila Kunis]] and [[Lisa Wilhoit]]. Kunis would later portray Jackie Burkhart on ''[[That '70s Show]]'', and voice [[Meg Griffin]] on ''[[Family Guy]]'' while Wilhoit would later voice Connie D'Amico on it.\n\n===Direction===\nThe film marked cinematographer [[Dean Cundey]]'s directorial debut. His director of photography credits include [[Steven Spielberg]]'s ''[[Jurassic Park (film)|Jurassic Park]]'', ''[[Hook (film)|Hook]]'', and some of [[John Carpenter]]'s early directorial efforts such as ''[[Halloween (1978 film)|Halloween]]'' (as well as its first two sequels), ''[[The Fog]]'', ''[[Big Trouble in Little China]]'', ''[[Escape from New York]]'' and ''[[The Thing (1982 film)|The Thing]]''. Originally when the film was going to be released to theaters, the production budget was $40 million. When it was announced that it would be released to home video, the budget was cut down to $7 million.\n\nDue to the production cut, the studio decided to use television resolution to save money on effects by not having to pay for a projectable format. Also, the original script included that the party had gotten out of control with around 150 kids, akin to ''[[Sixteen Candles]]'' or ''[[Say Anything...|Say Anything]]''. This was considered too costly and it was cut down.\n\nDespite the smaller budget, the availability of more advanced SFX technology created a more elaborate effect for the shrinking and enlarging sequences. Designer Carol Winstead Wood worked on product placement (see below) to increase her budget, enabling her to design & build more 'over scale' prop and set elements.\n\nThe film was digitally composited on three [[Apple Mac]] computers, using After Image and [[Windows Vista|Ultimate]] software, at Cundey's home before it was sent to the Dream Quest effects company for finessing.\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Sales===\nThe film was released direct-to-video on March 18, 1997. It coincided with the video releases of ''[[The Long Kiss Goodnight]]'' and ''[[The First Wives Club]]''.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}\n\n===Critical response===\n{{expand section|date=April 2015}}\nThe film received mostly negative reviews from critics. On the film rating website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film has an approval rating of 25%, based on 8 reviews.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/honey_we_shrunk_ourselves/ |title=Honey, We Shrunk Ourselves (1996) |work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |access-date=December 14, 2012}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of films featuring miniature people]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Official website|http://movies.disney.com/honey-we-shrunk-ourselves}}\n*{{IMDb title|0119310}}\n*{{AllRovi movie|179303}}\n\n{{wikiquote}}\n{{Honey, I Shrunk the Kids}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Honey, We Shrunk Ourselves}}\n[[Category:1997 films]]\n[[Category:1997 direct-to-video films]]\n[[Category:1990s science fiction comedy films]]\n[[Category:American children's comedy films]]\n[[Category:American science fiction comedy films]]\n[[Category:American sequel films]]\n[[Category:Direct-to-video sequel films]]\n[[Category:Disney direct-to-video films]]\n[[Category:Films about size change]]\n[[Category:Honey, I Shrunk the Kids (franchise) mass media]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Michael Tavera]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by Karey Kirkpatrick]]\n[[Category:Walt Disney Pictures films]]\n[[Category:1997 directorial debut films]]\n[[Category:1997 comedy films]]\n[[Category:1990s English-language films]]\n[[Category:Films set in 2000]]\n[[Category:1990s American films]]"}]}}}}
