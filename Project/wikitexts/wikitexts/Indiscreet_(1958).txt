This was Grant's and Bergman's second film together, after [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s ''[[Notorious (1946 film)|Notorious]]'' (1946), and was one of the first films to popularise artistic use of the technique of [[split screen (filmmaking)|split screens]]. The film was remade for television in 1988 starring [[Robert Wagner]] and [[Lesley-Anne Down]].\n\n== Plot ==\nAnna Kalman ([[Ingrid Bergman]]) is an accomplished London-based theatre actress who has given up her hopes of finding the man of her dreams. Through her brother-in-law, Alfred Munson ([[Cecil Parker]]), she meets a handsome economist, Philip Adams ([[Cary Grant]]). She is instantly captivated by him and expresses visible interest in him.\n\nAt the end of their first meeting, she makes a pass at him to go on a date sometime later to which he politely states that he is married. He further adds that he is separated and unable to get a divorce from his wife. Anna is seemingly unperturbed by the fact and still asks him out whereupon he agrees.\n\nThey hit it off on their first date and continue seeing each other frequently. Soon after, they fall in love. Anna is then cautioned by her sister Margaret ([[Phyllis Calvert]]) about the affair but she rebuffs her approach.\n\nAs their romance continues to blossom, Philip receives a temporary transfer notice to [[New York City|New York]] for his work at [[NATO]], which greatly distresses Anna as it will keep them apart for possibly five months.\n\nOn the day before Philip's scheduled sail, Alfred tells Philip that he knows Philip is a bachelor from Scotland Yard investigations and asks him the reason for this secret. Philip reveals that he is unenthusiastic about the idea of marriage but can't give up on women, which led him to develop this white lie. However, he assures Alfred that he sincerely loves Anna. He also tells that he plans to surprise Anna on her birthday the next day by delaying his departure by a few days and visiting her at midnight.\n\nAnna informs Alfred and Margaret that she plans to go to New York to surprise Philip. To discourage her, Alfred unwillingly discloses Philip's plan. Margaret further worsens the situation by stating that Philip is actually unmarried. Anna becomes furious upon learning this, as she takes this as an insult to her dignity. She decides to go on as if nothing happened but secretly concocts a plan to get even with him.\n\nShe arranges an elaborate ruse where it will appear that she was having an affair with David, an old flame, when Philip comes to visit her at midnight on her birthday. But it does not go as planned when David meets with an accident and she is informed that he can't come. She tries to solve it by making her elderly caretaker Carl ([[David Kossoff]]) play the part of David. Despite this, her plan goes haywire when Philip comes and actually proposes marriage to her and leaves when he mistakes Carl for David. She is absolutely distraught by this, but luckily Philip returns and she is able to clear up the confusion. She tells him that she is happy the way things are. But now Philip is adamant about getting married and tells her so. Hearing this, Anna becomes extremely happy and the film ends with the couple embracing each other.\n\n==Main cast ==\n* [[Cary Grant]] - Philip Adams\n* [[Ingrid Bergman]] - Anna Kalman\n* [[Cecil Parker]] - Alfred Munson\n* [[Phyllis Calvert]] - Margaret Munson\n* [[David Kossoff]] - Carl Banks\n* [[Megs Jenkins]] - Doris Banks\n\n==Production==\nNo film studio sought the rights to the play ''[[Kind Sir]]'', so [[Norman Krasna]]'s co-producers - [[Joshua Logan]], [[Mary Martin]], and [[Charles Boyer]] - agreed to Krasna's offer to buy the rights himself for $10,000. Krasna did not tell his fellow producers he had lined up Cary Grant and Ingrid Bergman to star in a film.<ref>Logan p 384</ref>\n\nIn March 1955 United Artists announced Krasna would direct a film version for that studio.<ref>VAN DRUTEN PLAY ON FILM SCHEDULE: Phoenix Will Make 'Bell, Book and Candle,' With Taradash Writing Screen Version By THOMAS M.

Donen agreed \"but only with Cary\". Grant agreed but only if his co-star was Ingrid Bergman (the two had last acted together in ''Notorious'' [1946]). Bergman agreed provided the film could be shot in England, as she had a theatre commitment in Paris. Krasna agreed to make the changes from the play. Donen and Grant formed a company together, Grandon Productions, to make the film.<ref name=\"times\">'INDISCREET' BEFORE THE CAMERA IN BRITAIN By STEPHEN WATT.
