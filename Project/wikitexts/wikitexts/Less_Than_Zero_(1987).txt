The film stars [[Andrew McCarthy]] as Clay, a college freshman returning home for Christmas to spend time with his ex-girlfriend Blair ([[Jami Gertz]]) and his friend Julian ([[Robert Downey Jr.]]), who is also a drug addict. The film presents a look at the culture of wealthy, decadent youth in Los Angeles.\n\n''Less than Zero'' received mixed reviews among critics. Ellis hated the film initially but his view of it later softened. He insists that the film bears no resemblance to his novel and felt that it was miscast with the exceptions of Downey and [[James Spader]].\n\n==Plot==\nClay Easton is a straight-laced college freshman on the [[East Coast of the United States]], who returns home to Los Angeles for Christmas to find things very different from the way he left them. His high school girlfriend and now model, Blair, has become addicted to cocaine and has been having sex with Clay's high school best friend, Julian Wells. Julian, whose life has gone downhill after his startup record company fell apart, has become a drug addict. He has also been cut off by his family for stealing to support his habit and reduced to homelessness. Julian is also being hassled by his dealer, a former classmate named Rip, for a debt of $50,000 that he owes to him.\n\nClay's relationship with Blair rekindles and Julian's behavior becomes more volatile. His addiction is worsening and since he does not have the money to pay off his debt, Rip forces him to become a prostitute to work it off. After suffering through a night of overdose and hiding from Rip, Julian decides to quit and begs his father to help him. The next day, Julian tells Rip his plans for sobriety, which Rip does not accept. Rip soon lures Julian to a Christmas party for affluent gay men in [[Palm Springs, California|Palm Springs]]. Clay finds Julian and rescues him; after a violent confrontation with Rip and his henchman, Clay, Julian and Blair all escape and begin the long drive through the desert so Julian can attempt to achieve sobriety once and for all. However, the damage has already been done; the next morning Julian dies from [[heart failure]] in the car.\n\nAfter Julian's funeral, Clay and Blair are sitting on a cemetery bench reminiscing about him. Clay then tells Blair that he is returning to the East Coast and wants her to go with him. She agrees to his offer. The film ends with a snapshot of the three of them at graduation, the last time they were happy together.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Andrew McCarthy]] as Clay Easton\n* [[Jami Gertz]] as Blair\n* [[Robert Downey Jr.]] as Julian Wells\n* [[James Spader]] as Rip\n* [[Nicholas Pryor]] as Benjamin Wells\n* [[Tony Bill]] as Bradford Easton\n* Donna Mitchell as Elaine Easton\n* [[Michael Bowen (actor)|Michael Bowen]] as Hop/Bill\n* [[Sarah G.

The book went on to become a best seller but the producers had to create a coherent story and change Clay, the central character, because they felt that he was too passive.<ref name= \"harmetz\" /> They also eliminated his bisexuality and casual drug use. Worth hired [[Pulitzer Prize]]-winning playwright [[Michael Cristofer]] to write the screenplay. He stuck close to the tone of the novel and had Clay take some drugs but did not make him bisexual. The studio felt that Cristofer's script was too harsh for a commercial film.<ref name= \"harmetz\" />\n\nFox then assigned the film to producer [[Jon Avnet]] who had made ''[[Risky Business]]''. He felt that Cristofer's script was \"so depressing and degrading.\"<ref name= \"harmetz\" /> Avnet instead wanted to transform \"a very extreme situation\" into \"a sentimental story about warmth, caring and tenderness in an atmosphere hostile to those kinds of emotions\".<ref name= \"crimeen\">{{cite news | last = Crimeen | first = Bob | title = Death in the Fast Lane - Hollywood Home Truths | work = [[Daily Telegraph]] | date = December 31, 1987 }}</ref> Studio executives and Avnet argued over the amount of decadence depicted in the film that would not alienate audiences. [[Lawrence Gordon (producer)|Lawrence Gordon]], the President of Fox who had approved the purchase of the book, was replaced by [[Alan F. Horn]], who was then replaced by [[Leonard Goldberg]]. Goldberg found the material distasteful but [[Barry Diller]], the Chairman of Fox, wanted to make the film.<ref name= \"harmetz\" />\n\n[[Harley Peyton]] was hired to write the script and completed three drafts.<ref name= \"harmetz\" /> In his version, Clay is no longer amoral or passive. The studio still considered the material edgy and kept the budget under $8 million.\n\n[[Claudia Weill]] was going to direct at one stage but then was dropped by the studio.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1988-03-11/entertainment/ca-1274_1_woman-film-director|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|title=A Fired Woman Film Director--New Questions, Issue Continues|date=March 11, 1988|first=Michael|last=Cieply}}</ref>\n\n[[Marek Kanievska]] was hired to direct because he had dealt with ambivalent sexuality and made unlikeable characters appealing in his previous film, ''[[Another Country (1984 film)|Another Country]]'' (1984). The studio wanted to appeal to actor Andrew McCarthy's teenage girl fans without alienating an older audience.<ref name= \"harmetz\" />\n\nCinematographer [[Edward Lachman]] remembers that originally the film was a lot \"edgier\" and that the studio took it away from Kanievska.<ref name= \"AMC\">{{cite news | title = Q&A - Cinematographer Ed Lachman on Censoring the Red Hot Chili Peppers and the Vitality of Robert Altman | work = [[AMC (TV channel)|AMC]] Movie Blog | date = May 2008 }}</ref> He also recalled a scene he shot with the music group [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]]: \"The Red Hot Chili Peppers were in that film and the studio became very conservative and they said, 'Oh the band, they're sweaty and they don't have their shirts on.' They destroyed an incredible Steadicam shot, all because they had to cut around them being bare-chested\".<ref name= \"AMC\" />\n\nAt an early test screening, the studio recruited an audience between the ages of 15 and 24; they hated Robert Downey Jr.'s character.<ref name= \"harmetz\" /> As a result, new scenes were shot to make his and Jami Gertz's character more repentant. For example, a high school graduation scene was shot to lighten the mood by showing the three main characters as good friends during better times.<ref name= \"harmetz\" />\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Box office===\n''Less than Zero'' opened at No. 4 on November 6, 1987 in 871 theaters and made US$3,008,987, behind ''[[Fatal Attraction]]''{{'}}s eighth weekend, ''[[Hello Again (1987 film)|Hello Again]]''{{'}}s opening, and ''[[Baby Boom (film)|Baby Boom]]''{{'}}s fifth weekend.

[[History of film|Film historian]] [[Leonard Maltin]] gave it two-out-of-four stars, his most frequently given rating: \"Bret Ellis' nihilistic story is sanitized into pointlessness, although chances are an entirely faithful adaptation would have turned ''everyone'' off; try to imagine this picture with [[Eddie Bracken]], [[Veronica Lake]], and [[Sonny Tufts]].\" Indeed, Maltin despised the faithfully-adapted film version of a second Ellis novel, ''[[The Rules of Attraction (film)|The Rules of Attraction]]'', which he considered a BOMB (Maltin's lowest possible rating).<ref>Maltin's TV, Movie, & Video Guide</ref>\n\nReview aggregation website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] gave it a score of 50% based on 28 reviews, with an average rating of 5.2/10. The critical consensus reads: \"A couple of standout performances -- notably Robert Downey, Jr. and James Spader -- and a killer soundtrack can't quite elevate a somewhat superficial adaptation of Bret Easton Ellis' story of drugged-out LA rich kids.\"<ref name=\"tomatoes\">{{rotten-tomatoes|less_than_zero|Less Than Zero}} [[Flixster]] {{Retrieved|access-date=2022-07-06}}</ref> [[Metacritic]], which uses a [[weighted average]], assigned the film a score of 48 out of 100, based on 13 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".<ref>{{Cite web |title=Less Than Zero Reviews |url=https://www.metacritic.com/movie/less-than-zero |access-date=September 25, 2022 |website=Metacritic |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]]}}</ref> Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"C+\" on an A+ to F scale.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Home |url=https://www.cinemascore.com/ |access-date=2022-09-25 |website=CinemaScore |language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nIn ''[[The New York Times]]'', Janet Maslin wrote, \"Mr. Downey gives a performance that is desperately moving, with the kind of emotion that comes as a real surprise in these surroundings.\"<ref>{{cite news | last = Maslin | first = Janet | title = ''Less Than Zero'', Young Lives | work = [[The New York Times]] | date = November 6, 1987 | url = https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE4DA1239F935A35752C1A961948260 | access-date = 2007-11-16 }}</ref> \nRita Kempley, in her review for ''[[The Washington Post]]'', called the film, \"noodle-headed and faint-hearted, a shallow swipe at a serious problem, with a happily-ever-after ending yet.\"<ref>{{cite news | last = Kempley | first = Rita | title = ''Zero'': Paying Through the Nose | newspaper = [[The Washington Post]] | date = November 6, 1987 }}</ref> \nIn ''[[Newsweek]]'', [[David Ansen]] wrote, \"Imagine [[Michelangelo Antonioni|Antonioni]] making a high-school public-service movie and you'll have an inkling of the movie's high-toned silliness.\"<ref>{{cite news | last = Ansen | first = David | title = Down and Out in Gucci and Gomorrah | work = [[Newsweek]] | date = November 16, 1987 }}</ref>\nIn the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'', [[Roger Ebert]] gave ''Less than Zero'' a four-star review, noting that the \"movie knows cocaine inside out and paints a portrait of drug addiction that is all the more harrowing because it takes place in the Beverly Hills fast lane...The movie's three central performances are flawless...[Robert Downey, Jr's] acting here is so real, so subtle and so observant that it's scary...The whole movie looks brilliantly superficial, and so Downey's predicament is all the more poignant: He is surrounded by all of this, he is in it and of it, and yet he cannot have it.\"<ref name=\"ebert\">{{cite news | last = Ebert | first = Roger | author-link = Roger Ebert | title = ''Less Than Zero'' | work = [[Chicago Sun-Times]] | date = November 6, 1987 | url = https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/less-than-zero-1987 | access-date = 2021-02-01 }} \n{{Rating|4|4}}</ref> \n''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' magazine's [[David Denby (film critic)|David Denby]] wrote, \"In many ways, ''Less than Zero'' is a cynical, manipulative job.
