The film was written by [[Neil Jordan]] and [[David Leland]], and directed by Jordan. It was produced by [[HandMade Films]] and stars [[Bob Hoskins]], [[Cathy Tyson]], and [[Michael Caine]].\n\nThe film was nominated for multiple awards, and Bob Hoskins was nominated for several awards for his performance (including the [[Academy Award for Best Actor]]), winning the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor \u2013 Motion Picture Drama]] and [[BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role]].\n\n==Plot==\nGeorge, a low-level working-class gangster recently released after seven years in prison, is given a job in London by his former boss, Denny Mortwell, as the driver and bodyguard for a high-priced prostitute named Simone. Mortwell also wants George to gather information on one of Simone's wealthy customers for blackmail purposes. Simone, who has worked hard to develop high-class manners and an elite clientele, initially dislikes the uncouth and outspoken George, and he regards her as putting on airs. But as George and Simone find out more about each other, they form a friendship, and George begins to fall in love with her. George agrees, at the risk of his own life, to help Simone find her teenage friend Cathy, who has disappeared, and who Simone fears is being abused by her violent former pimp, Anderson.\n\nGeorge increasingly finds himself torn between his feelings for Simone, his obligations to his boss Mortwell, and his relationship with his teenage daughter Jeannie, a sweet normal girl who has matured while he was in prison and wants to have her father in her life.\n\nAfter Anderson tries to slash Simone and attacks George, Simone flees to Brighton. George finally finds Cathy and takes her to Brighton to reunite her with Simone, where he lends Simone a gun. He discovers that Simone and Cathy are lovers. Mortwell and Anderson arrive to take back control of Simone and Cathy, but Simone shoots them both dead and turns her gun towards George. He punches her, takes the gun and leaves. Freed of his underworld obligations, George returns to a more normal life, working in his friend Thomas's garage and spending time with Jeannie.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Bob Hoskins]] as George\n* [[Cathy Tyson]] as Simone\n* [[Michael Caine]] as Denny Mortwell\n* [[Robbie Coltrane]] as Thomas\n* [[Clarke Peters]] as Anderson\n* [[Kate Hardie]] as Cathy\n* [[Zo\u00eb Nathenson]] as Jeannie\n* [[Sammi Davis]] as May\n* Rod Bedall as Terry\n* [[Joe Brown (singer)|Joe Brown]] as Dudley\n* [[Pauline Melville]] as George's Wife\n* Hossein Karimbeik as Raschid\n* John Darling as hotel security\n* [[Maggie O'Neill]] as girl in Paradise Club\n* [[Bryan Coleman]] as Gentleman in mirror room\n* [[Robert Dorning]] as hotel bedroom man\n* [[Perry Fenwick]] as pimp\n}}\n\n==Reception==\nThe film received positive critical reception when released in 1986. Film critic [[Roger Ebert]] wrote of the two main characters \"The relationship of their characters in the film is interesting, because both people, for personal reasons, have developed a style that doesn't reveal very much.\"<ref name=RE>Ebert, Roger (2 July 1986) [https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/mona-lisa-1986 \"Review: ''Mona Lisa''\"] ''Chicago Sun-Times'' (Retrieved: 6 July 2021)</ref> However, [[Vincent Canby]], writing for ''[[The New York Times]]'', dismissed the film as \"classy kitsch.\"<ref>Canby, Vincent (13 July 1986) [https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9A0DE7D81F3EF930A25755C0A960948260 \"Movie Review: ''Mona Lisa'' (1986)\"].
