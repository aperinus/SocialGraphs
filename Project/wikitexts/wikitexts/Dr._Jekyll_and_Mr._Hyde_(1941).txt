The production also features [[Donald Crisp]], [[Ian Hunter (actor)|Ian Hunter]], [[Barton MacLane]], [[C. Aubrey Smith]], and [[Sara Allgood]]. Its storyline is based on the 1886 [[Gothic fiction|Gothic]] [[novella]] ''[[Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde]]'' written by Scottish author [[Robert Louis Stevenson]]. There have been [[Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (disambiguation)|many filmed adaptations of the novella]]. This movie was a remake of the [[Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (1931 film)|Oscar-winning 1931 version starring Fredric March]].\n\nReleased in August 1941, ''Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde'' was a commercial success, and was nominated for three [[Academy Awards]].\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1887 London, Dr. Henry Jekyll is performing research experiments on the possibility of separating the good and evil aspects of human nature. Jekyll is in love with Beatrix Emery, but her father, Sir Charles, is skeptical of Jekyll's radical ideas. Jekyll develops a serum that he attempts to use on Sam Higgins, a patient who went insane after suffering a gas works explosion, but the plan fails when Jekyll learns Sam has died. Instead, Jekyll impulsively takes the serum himself, and is transformed in mindset and countenance into a malevolent alter ego. Jekyll takes an [[antidote]] to reverse the serum's effects, but not before experience an auditory hallucination in which a voice speaks: \"Mr. Hyde.\"\n\nBeatrix departs England on a trip abroad with her father, who is concerned about the love affair between the two, leaving Jekyll alone. When Beatrix's father extends Marcia's time away from London, Jekyll continues to experiment with the serum, ingesting another dose. In his alter ego of Mr. Hyde, he ventures into a music hall where he spots attractive barmaid Ivy Peterson, whom he saved from an attacker in the streets some weeks before. Because his face and manner is disfigured by the evil brought out by the serum, Ivy does not recognize him, and becomes frightened when approaching his table. Hyde surreptitiously instigates mayhem in the music hall, tripping one man, hitting another with a cane, poking another in the eye, pitting one patron against another until a brawl ensues, after which Hyde convinces the owner that Ivy was the cause of the trouble, and bribes the hall owner to fire her. Hyde takes a reluctant Ivy home with him, and [[rape]]s her in the carriage.\n\nWhile Beatrix grows concerned after receiving no correspondence, Hyde provides Ivy housing in a flat, although she live in fear of Hyde's psychological manipulation and violent behavior. When Ivy's friend Marcia visits her, Marcia see bruises on Ivy's back and suspects Ivy is being abused, but before she can find out what is going on Hyde appears and menaces Marcia, who leaves in a hurry; afterward Hyde taunts Ivy that Marcia is more beautiful than Ivy, and he may leave Ivy to pursue Marcia, before subsequently tormenting Ivy by forcing her to sing against her will as a prelude to raping her.\n\nUpon learning that Beatrix has returned to England, Jekyll vows not to take the serum again. He sends Ivy an anonymous gift of money before destroying the key to the street entrance of his laboratory, the entrance that he had been using while under the influence of Hyde. Later, Ivy visits Jekyll as a patient, and recognizes him as the man who helped her in the street. When she shows him her injuries and he realizes what Hyde has done to her, Jekyll is ashamed.\n\nLater that night, as Jekyll ventures to meet Beatrix, who has returned to England, he unexpectedly transforms into Hyde without having ingested the serum. Hyde instead ventures to Ivy's flat and finds her drunk and celebrating her freedom from him. When Hyde repeats phrases that Jekyll spoke to her, she grows terrified and begins screaming, resulting in Hyde strangling her to death. Hyde flees to the laboratory, but cannot enter as Jekyll destroyed the key; instead, Hyde visits Dr. John Lanyon, a friend of Jekyll. Lanyon provides him the medication that works as the antidote, and Hyde reverts back to Jekyll, much to Lanyon's horror.\n\nJekyll confesses to Lanyon everything that has transpired, and proceeds to visit Beatrix to end their engagement. Beatrix is distraught by the incident, and is horrified when he returns transformed as Hyde. Beatrix screams before losing consciousness. Her father, roused by Beatrix's scream, enters the room, only to be bludgeoned to death by Hyde with Jekyll's cane. Hyde flees back to the laboratory, and, unable to enter through the street door, pushes past Jekyll's butler, Poole. Meanwhile, as police investigate Sir Charles's body, Lanyon arrives and observes that Jekyll's cane was the murder weapon. Realizing Jekyll committed the crime while in his alter ego state as Mr. Hyde, Lanyon convinces police to accompany him to Jekyll's home.\n\nLanyon and the authorities arrive at Jekyll's home moments after Hyde has ingested the antidote and turned back into Jekyll. Breaking down the door to the laboratory, they confront him about Sir Charles's murder. The psychological stress of the situation triggers Jekyll into returning back into Mr. Hyde, and he becomes violent. While attempting to fight police, Hyde is shot by Lanyon. As he dies, his demeanor and countenance slowly morphs back into that of Jekyll.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast list|\n* [[Spencer Tracy]] as Dr. Henry Jekyll / Mr. Edward Hyde\n* [[Ingrid Bergman]] as Ivy Pearson\n* [[Lana Turner]] as Beatrix Emery\n* [[Donald Crisp]] as Sir Charles Emery\n* [[Ian Hunter (actor)|Ian Hunter]] as John Lanyon\n* [[Barton MacLane]] as Sam Higgins\n* [[C.

Both Hollywood productions differ greatly from the original literary work due to their heavy reliance on [[Thomas Russell Sullivan]]'s 1887 stage [[Theatrical adaptation|adaptation]] of the story. The director for the 1941 film was [[Victor Fleming]], who had directed ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with the Wind]]'' and codirected ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'', two major releases by [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] in 1939. MGM, where Fleming was under contract, acquired full rights to the 1931 film from [[Paramount Pictures]] prior to Fleming's production. According to the Robert Louis Stevenson website being archived and preserved by the [[British Library]], subsequent to that acquisition MGM studio executives \u201chid the [1931] film away to avoid competition with their remake\u201d.<ref name=\"RMSwebsite\">{{cite web|url=http://www.robert-louis-stevenson.org/richard-dury-archive/films-rls-jekyll-hyde.html|title=Film Versions of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde: 1931 Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde (Mamoulian)|work=The Robert Louis Stevenson Archive (RLS Website)|publisher=[[Edinburgh Napier University]]|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161223095806/http://www.robert-louis-stevenson.org/richard-dury-archive/films-rls-jekyll-hyde.html|archive-date=December 23, 2016}}</ref> The 1931 version then, due to ongoing legal restrictions and the lack of readily available copies, was effectively \u201clost\u201d for over a quarter of a century, not generally available again for re-screenings and study until 1967.<ref name=\"RMSwebsite\"/>\n\nMGM's 1941 remake was produced by [[Victor Saville]] and adapted by [[John Lee Mahin]] from the screenplay of the earlier film by [[Percy Heath (screenwriter)|Percy Heath]] and [[Samuel Hoffenstein]].
