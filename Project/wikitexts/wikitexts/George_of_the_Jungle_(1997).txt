The film was produced by [[Walt Disney Pictures]] and was released in theatres throughout the United States and Canada on July 16, 1997. It was later aired on [[Disney Channel]] in the United States on December 5, 1998. It stars [[Brendan Fraser]] as the title character, a primitive man who was raised by animals in an African jungle, [[Leslie Mann]] as Ursula, George's [[Romance (love)|love interest]], and [[Thomas Haden Church]] as her treacherous former fianc\u00e9. The film received mixed reviews and grossed $174 million worldwide. A sequel, ''[[George of the Jungle 2]]'', was released direct-to-video on October 21, 2003.\n\n==Plot==\nWhile touring [[Uganda]] with [[Indigenous peoples of Africa|local]] guide Kwame and a trio of porters, [[San Francisco]] heiress Ursula Stanhope is tracked down and joined by her [[fianc\u00e9]], Lyle Van De Groot, with [[two]] [[poacher]]s named Max and [[Thor]]. Kwame tells the group of the \"[[White Africans of European ancestry|White]] Ape\", a local legend of a superhuman primate that rules the [[jungle]]. The next day, Lyle, insistent on taking Ursula home as soon as possible, goes into the jungle with her to find the White Ape, and they are attacked by a lion. Lyle knocks himself out trying to flee while Ursula is saved by the King of the Jungle, George, who takes Ursula to his [[tree house]] home and cares for her, introducing her to his three animal friends: Ape, a sapient, talking gorilla who raised George; Shep, an [[Asian elephant]] that acts like George's dog; and Tookie, a [[toco toucan]]. George is smitten with Ursula and attempts to woo her; Ursula soon reciprocates his attraction, and her time spent with George makes her no longer wish to return home.\n\nLyle, Max, and Thor find the treehouse, and Lyle confronts Ursula and George. Max and Thor make to shoot Shep for his [[ivory]], and Ape shouts at Shep to run. Everyone is stunned by the sight of a talking ape, and Max and Thor decide to tranquilize and capture him. George runs to stop them and is accidentally shot by Lyle, who thought his gun was a novelty lighter. Lyle and the poachers are imprisoned, and Lyle is identified as the shooter by the porters; Max and Thor are released and resolve to capture Ape to make a fortune in [[Las Vegas]]. Meanwhile, Ursula takes George to [[San Francisco]] to get medical help for his wound and to see the [[human]] world, which George is fascinated with.\n\nWhile Ursula is at work, George explores San Francisco on his own and uses his vine-swinging to rescue a [[paragliding|paraglider]] tangled in the [[San Francisco\u2013Oakland Bay Bridge|Bay Bridge]]. Uninterested in marrying Lyle, Ursula admits the truth to her parents, but her overbearing mother Beatrice objects. At a party intended to celebrate Ursula's engagement, Beatrice takes George aside and coldly tells him she will not let Ursula's engagement fall apart, and refuses to let George be with her. In Africa, Max and Thor capture Ape, who manages to order Tookie to find George before he falls unconscious. Tookie flies to San Francisco, and George returns to the jungle, leaving Ursula in the night. While comforted by her parents, Ursula realizes she loves George and goes to find him with her father's approval.\n\nApe tricks the poachers into circling the jungle and returning to the treehouse where George confronts and eventually incapacitates them, though not without some trouble, as the two team up on him, twisting his nipples and even tickle torturing him in front of Ape to humiliate him and make him tap out, but George somehow endures and takes them down with help from a newly arriving Ursula. However, Lyle arrives too, having escaped prison, joined a cult, and become an ordained minister. Lyle has the mercenaries he brought with him subdue George and takes Ursula to the nearby Ape River, where he has a boat waiting to escape while he performs a marriage ceremony. However, the river is a harsh series of rapids that hurtle the two into danger. George escapes the mercenaries and performs a big swing to reach Ursula and Lyle, only to crash painfully into a massive tree, which falls over the river and allows him to pull Ursula to safety. Lyle ends up in a cave and, believing he is still sharing the boat with Ursula, proclaims them wedded; he lights his lighter and beholds that he has just married himself to a gorilla.\n\nGeorge and Ursula declare their love for each other and marry, with Ursula moving into George's treehouse. Some time later, the two are raising a son, George Jr., whom they present to the animals from atop [[The Lion King|Pride Rock]]. Meanwhile, Ape moves to [[Las Vegas]] and becomes a famous stage performer with Max and Thor as props.\n\n==Cast==\n\n* [[Brendan Fraser]] as George, a young man who was raised in the jungle like [[Tarzan]] and frequently crashes into trees while swinging on vines.<ref>{{cite news|title= GEORGE, GEORGE, GEORGE OF THE JUNGLE A TREE-SWINGING BRENDAN FRASER ENJOYED PUN AND GAMES OF MAKING NEW DISNEY FILM |work= [[The Morning Call|Morning Call]]|url= http://articles.mcall.com/1997-07-18/features/3163399_1_jungle-boom-george|access-date=2010-11-12}}</ref> Fraser had concurrently auditioned for the title role in [[Tarzan (1999 film)|Disney's serious animated adaptation of ''Tarzan'']], which would be released in 1999, but lost to [[Tony Goldwyn]].<ref name=\"tarzanyell\">{{cite news|title='Tarzan' Yell|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1999-06-16/features/9906160335_1_bonnie-arnold-edgar-rice-burroughs-chris-buck/|work=[[Knight-Ridder]]|publisher=Chicago Tribune|date=June 16, 1999|access-date=September 11, 2015|last=Lawson|first=Terry}}</ref>\n* [[Leslie Mann]] as Ursula Stanhope, a wealthy heiress and George's love interest.\n* [[Thomas Haden Church]] as Lyle van de Groot, Ursula's former narcissistic wealthy fianc\u00e9.\n* [[Richard Roundtree]] as Kwame, Ursula's jungle guide.\n* [[Greg Cruttwell]] and [[Abraham Benrubi]] as Max and Thor, two poachers and trackers who were working for Lyle.\n* [[John Bennett Perry]] as Arthur Stanhope, Ursula's supportive father who takes a shine to George.\n* [[Holland Taylor]] as Beatrice Stanhope, Ursula's controlling mother, who believes that social position is more important than having a loving marriage.
