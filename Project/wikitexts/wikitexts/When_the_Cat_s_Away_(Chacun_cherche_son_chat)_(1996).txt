The movie is set in [[Paris]] and stars Garance Clavel, [[Zinedine Soualem]], Ren\u00e9e Le Calm, [[Olivier Py]], [[Romain Duris]], [[H\u00e9l\u00e8ne de Fougerolles]], [[Hiam Abbass]] and others.\n\n== Plot ==\nThe story is about a young woman living in Paris, in the Bastille neighborhood, who has lost her cat. Through the pursuit of the cat, the film lets the spectator discover the contrasts of the district, which is evolving from a typical Parisian district to a modern and young district and the contrast between its inhabitants, among them a nice simpleton and the old women who are bored. In fact it is the story of a village in a large city, Klapisch shows once again the behaviour of an individual inside a group, as he did in ''[[Le p\u00e9ril jeune]]'' or ''[[Riens du tout]]''. This time he has succeeded in joining together actors, theatre actors and residents of the district, creating a credible atmosphere that is probably the reason for the success of this film outside France.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Garance Clavel]] as Chlo\u00e9\n* [[Zinedine Soualem]] as Djamel\n* {{Interlanguage link|Ren\u00e9e Le Calm|fr}} as Madame Ren\u00e9e\n* [[Olivier Py]] as Michel\n* [[Simon Abkarian]] as Carlos\n* {{Interlanguage link|Jo\u00ebl Brisse|fr}} as le peintre \u00ab Bel Canto \u00bb\n* [[Marilyne Canto]] as la femme flic\n* [[Andr\u00e9e Damant]] as Madame Dubois\n* {{Interlanguage link|Jacqueline Jehanneuf|fr}} as Madame Henriette\n* [[Romain Duris]] as The drummer\n* [[H\u00e9l\u00e8ne de Fougerolles]] as a Model\n* [[Marine Delterme]] as a Model\n* [[Eriq Ebouaney]] as The Cabinetmaker worker\n* [[Hiam Abbass]] as a Woman\n\n== Soundtrack ==\nThe main title \"Food for Love\" was composed and performed by [[Cqmd]].<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0115856/soundtrack \"When the Cat's Away (1996) - Soundtracks\", IMDb.]</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{IMDb title|id=0115856}}\n\n{{C\u00e9dric Klapisch}}\n\n[[Category:1996 films]]\n[[Category:1990s romantic comedy films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by C\u00e9dric Klapisch]]\n[[Category:Films set in Paris]]\n[[Category:French comedy films]]\n[[Category:1990s French-language films]]\n[[Category:1996 comedy films]]\n[[Category:1990s French films]]\n\n\n{{1990s-romantic-comedy-film-stub}}\n{{1990s-France-film-stub}}"}]}}}}
