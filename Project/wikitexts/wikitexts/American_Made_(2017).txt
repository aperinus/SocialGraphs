He asks Seal, who has been smuggling [[Cuban cigar]]s into the country via Canada, to fly clandestine reconnaissance missions for the CIA over [[Central America]] using a small, fast, twin-engine [[Piper Aerostar|Piper Smith Aerostar]] 600, outfitted with sophisticated aerial surveillance cameras. Seal tells his wife, Lucy, he's still with TWA.\n\nIn the 1980s, Schafer asks Seal to start acting as a courier between the CIA and [[Manuel Noriega|General Noriega]] in [[Panama]]. During a mission, the [[Medell\u00edn Cartel]] picks Seal up and asks him to fly cocaine on his return flights to the United States. Seal accepts and starts flying the cartel's cocaine to [[Louisiana]], delivering the drugs via airdrop in the countryside instead of landing at an airport. The CIA turns a blind eye to the drug smuggling, but the [[Drug Enforcement Administration|DEA]] tracks Seal down. To avoid the authorities, Seal and his family must relocate to the remote town of [[Mena, Arkansas]], and his wife comes to accept the wealth generated by his new life. The small town gradually becomes wealthy as the hub of U.S. cocaine trafficking.\n\nLater, Schafer asks Seal to run guns to the [[Contras|Nicaraguan Contras]] based in [[Honduras]]. Seal realizes that the Contras are not serious about the war and just want to get rich and he starts trading the guns to the cartel. The CIA sets up a Contra training base in Mena and Seal flies the Contras in, but many of them escape as soon as they arrive.\n\nSeal makes so much money he buries it in suitcases in the backyard. Seal's freeloading brother-in-law JB moves in, needing a job. Eventually, he starts stealing money from the Seals and is arrested after Sheriff Joe Downing catches him with a briefcase full of laundered cash. With JB out on bail, Seal gives him money and a plane ticket to [[Bora Bora]] and tells him to get lost for his safety. JB demands weekly cash and insults Lucy. As Barry chases after him, JB is killed in his car by a bomb placed by the Medell\u00edn Cartel, who had previously promised to \"take care\" of the JB problem.\n\nThe FBI soon catches wind of the sudden exuberance on the streets of Mena, not helped by JB's reckless spending, and eventually, the CIA shuts the program down and abandons Seal, who is arrested by the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]], DEA, [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives|ATF]] and [[Arkansas State Police]] simultaneously. Seal escapes prosecution by making a deal with the [[White House]], which wants evidence of the [[Sandinista National Liberation Front|Sandinistas]] being drug traffickers. They ask Seal to get photos that tie the Medell\u00edn Cartel to the Nicaraguan Sandinistas. Seal manages to get the pictures, but the White House releases them as propaganda against the Sandinistas. Seal is prominently shown in the pictures, which leads to his indictment by the crusading state attorney general, and the cartel plotting revenge.\n\nSeal is convicted but sentenced to only 1,000 hours of [[Community service|community service]]. Moving from [[Motel|motel]] to motel making [[Videotapes|video recordings]] of his experiences, Seal fears an [[Car bomb|explosion]] anytime he starts his car. As his community service is performed at the same [[Salvation Army]] building every night, Seal cannot hide from the cartel and is shot dead by assassins. The CIA destroys all evidence connecting them to Seal. After Seal is dead, the CIA continues smuggling, instead [[Iran\u2013Contra affair|using Iran to get guns to the Contras]], as proposed by Schafer.\n\nThe film ends with Schafer getting promoted for his idea, though it is soon discovered by the public with reporters asking [[Ronald Reagan|President Reagan]] and [[George H. W. Bush|Vice President Bush]] about the scandal. Lucy and her kids move back to [[Baton Rouge]], where she is seen contentedly working in fast food. One of her expensive pieces of jewelry is seen on her wrist.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Tom Cruise]] as [[Barry Seal]]\n* [[Domhnall Gleeson]] as CIA Agent Monty Schafer\n* [[Sarah Wright]] as Lucy Seal\n* [[Jesse Plemons]] as Sheriff Joe Downing, of Mena, Arkansas\n* [[Caleb Landry Jones]] as J.B., Lucy's Brother\n* [[Jayma Mays]] as State Attorney General Dana Sibota\n* [[Lola Kirke]] as Judy Downing\n* [[Connor Trinneer]] as [[George W.
