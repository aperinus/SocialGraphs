Evans]] and [[Raynold Gideon]], and produced by [[Lorimar Productions]]. The film stars [[Timothy Hutton]] and [[Kelly McGillis]] and has cameos by [[Tom Petty]], [[Ric Ocasek]], [[Ellen Barkin]] and [[Neil Young]]. Emmett, a chain-smoking male angel, was played by [[Debra Winger]] (Hutton's then wife), but the character was only credited as being played by \"Himself.\"\n\nThe original music score was composed by [[Mark Isham]]. The film was marketed with the tagline \"How in Heaven did they meet? How on Earth will they find each other?\"\n\n''Made in Heaven'' concerns two [[soul]]s who cross paths in [[Heaven]] and then attempt to reconnect once they are reborn on Earth.\n\nIn 1988, the film was released on VHS format as well as digital stereo LaserDisc format. In 2009, the film made its DVD debut as part of the [[Warner Archive Collection]].\n\n==Plot==\nIn a small Pennsylvania town in 1957, Mike Shea (Hutton) dreams of escaping small-town life and moving to California with his girlfriend Brenda Carlucci. But Brenda leaves him with his motor running and Mike takes off alone.\n\nOn the way to California, Mike rescues a woman and her children from their car which went into a river but he perishes. Finding himself in Heaven, his Aunt Lisa greets him, and explains the rules and regulations. While searching for someone he used to know, Mike comes across heavenly guide Annie Packert (McGillis), and instantly they fall in love.\n\nUnlike Mike, Annie has not yet lived on Earth, so their love is abruptly interrupted, just as they are going to perform a wedding ceremony. As she has not yet earned her wings on Earth, she must leave on a tour of duty and put in time inhabiting a human body.\n\nMike is beside himself with despair, but the heavenly powers, in the form of Emmett Humbird, chain-smoking and sporting an orange crew-cut, offer him a deal. Mike can return to Earth, with the stipulation that neither he nor Annie will remember each other. He then has 30 years in which they must find each other again.\n\nAlly, the reincarnation of Annie, names her imaginary friend Mike. She grows up, gets married and writes a book whose protagonist is Mike. Her husband leaves her, and she is disconnected for a time. She dreams and daydreams of Mike, which confuses her, as she's not met him yet in this life.\n\nMike is reborn as Elmo, at 28 Emmett visits him because he is pretty much a lost soul. Just conned by a woman, he's wandering down the road. Later, he gets a copy of Ally's book.\n\nMike ends up meeting his original parents while hitchhiking, they are kind to him and buy him a trumpet. As a result, Elmo starts his musical career and ends up writing a hit song that he had been working on in Heaven. The song was \"We Never Danced\", a very \u201880s sounding song and one of the last words Annie spoke to Mike in heaven.\n\nMike/Elmo ends up finding Ally/Annie on the street at the end of the film, and their eyes lock on one another. It's his 30th birthday, they met in the nick of time.\n\n==Cast==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- bgcolor=\"CCCCCC\"\n! Actor !!
