It is the third installment in the [[American Pie Presents (film series)|''American Pie Presents'' film series]], a [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] of the [[American Pie (film series)|''American Pie'' franchise]]. [[John White (actor)|John White]] stars as Erik Stifler, a college freshman who pledges the Beta House fraternity led by his cousin Dwight Stifler ([[Steve Talley]]). [[Christopher McDonald]] co-stars as Erik's father and [[Eugene Levy]] plays Beta House alumnus Noah Levenstein. It was preceded by ''[[American Pie Presents: The Naked Mile|The Naked Mile]]'' (2006).\n\nUniversal commissioned the film after positive commercial reaction to ''The Naked Mile''. Writer Erik Lindsay, producer W.K. Border and four of the five main cast members from the preceding film returned. Principal photography took place for seven to eight weeks from June 4, 2007, in [[Toronto|Toronto, Ontario]], [[Canada]].\n\n''American Pie Presents: Beta House'' was released [[direct-to-video|direct-to-DVD]] internationally on December&nbsp;10, 2007, and in the United States on December&nbsp;26, 2007. The film was a moderate financial success, generating US$18.55 million in United States sales. It received generally negative reviews from film critics.\n\n==Plot==\nAfter his girlfriend Tracy breaks up with him, Erik Stifler and his friend Cooze arrive at the [[University of Michigan]] as freshmen. Erik meets a girl named Ashley and his new roommate Bobby. Erik is then welcomed by his cousin, Dwight Stifler, the leader of the Beta House [[Fraternities and sororities|fraternity]]; who invites Erik, Cooze, and Bobby to a party. They meet Wesley, the rush chair of Beta House who experiences alcohol [[Blackout (drug-related amnesia)|blackouts]], and learn how they can gain eligibility to pledge for the Beta House. They are also informed by Dwight that the Geek House, ran by wealthy nerds, has been trying to shut down Beta House.\n\nErik and Ashley go on a first date at a restaurant where he has hot soup spilled accidentally on his lap, so she brings him to her room to clean up. As Ashley rubs lotion on Erik's thigh, he accidentally ejaculates on her belongings. Erik apologizes, explaining that, after breaking up with Tracy, he has not had an orgasm in four months as masturbation is taboo in his house because of a previous incident. \n\nMeanwhile, Cooze falls for Ashley's roommate Denise; however, she is nervous about having sex with him, so she gives Cooze a [[handjob]] instead. After talking with Erik, Bobby, and Dwight about Denise, Cooze develops suspicions that Denise might [[Transexual|have a penis]].\n\nAlong with two other pledges, Erik, Cooze, and Bobby complete fifty tasks to pledge the Beta House, including: getting their butts signed by a stripper, having sex with a professor, marrying a fellow pledge, and placing a live ostrich in the Geek House. After they complete their final task (stealing something from the Geek House), Edgar, the president of the Geek House, challenges the Beta House to the \"Greek Olympiad\", with the winners taking the loser's House. Before the competition starts, Dwight learns that while attempting to rush the [[Dwarfism|midget]] fraternity, Edgar had [[Bestiality|sex with a sheep]].\n\nBeing the Olympiad's last winner, Beta House [[alumnus]] [[Noah Levenstein]] returns to campus to officiate the competition. The first game is won by Beta House as Dwight and Edgar compete in removing girls' [[brassieres]]. Geek House win the next three matches: a [[Pugil stick|pugil bout]] turned [[lightsaber]] duel, catching a greased pig, and a two-person \"[[69 (sexual position)|69]]\" race. Beta House wins the fifth and sixth competitions: a [[Russian roulette]] challenge between Dwight and Edgar with aged horse semen; and a beer drinking competition between all members of both Houses ultimately won by Wesley via a [[keg stand]].\n\nDuring the final [[lap dance]] challenge, Beta House uses Edgar's sheep [[Sexual fetishism|fetish]] against him with Bobby's girlfriend Margie wearing a sheep costume, resulting in the Geek House losing the Olympiad. Having won the Geek House mansion, the Beta House hosts a [[toga party]]. Erik and Ashley establish their relationship and have sex. Meanwhile, Cooze and Denise finally sleep together as well, and Cooze discovers that what Denise is hiding is the fact that she [[Female ejaculation|ejaculates]] during sex, much to his excitement. \n\nIn a [[post-credits scene]], Edgar instructs a stripper at the Silver Dollar to dance with the headpiece of the sheep costume.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[John White (actor)|John White]] as Erik Stifler, a freshman pledging the Beta House\n* [[Steve Talley]] as Dwight Stifler, the [[wikt:pledgemaster|pledgemaster]] and leader of the Beta House who is Erik's cousin\n* [[Eugene Levy]] as Noah Levenstein, Beta House alumnus and the officiator of the Greek Olympiad\n* [[Jake Siegel]] as Mike \"Cooze\" Coozeman, Erik's friend and a freshman pledging the Beta House alongside Erik and Bobby\n* Nick Nicotera as Bobby, Erik's roommate and his friend who is a freshman pledging the Beta House with Erik and Cooze\n* [[Meghan Heffern]] as Ashley Thomas, Erik's love interest\n* [[Tyrone Savage]] as Edgar Willis, the leader of the Geek House and main antagonist\n* [[Sarah Power]] as Denise, Cooze's love interest\n* [[Christopher McDonald]] as Mr. Stifler, Erik's father\n* [[Angela Besharah]] as Irene\n* [[Jonathan Keltz]] as Wesley, a member and the [[wikt:rush|rush]] chair of the Beta House\n* [[Dan Petronijevic]] as Bull, a member of the Beta House\n* [[Christine Barger]] as Margie, Bobby's girlfriend\n* [[Bradford Anderson]] as Jake Parker, a member of the Geek House who uses a wheelchair\n* [[Robbie Amell]] as Nick Anderson, a freshman pledging the Beta House\n* [[Italia Ricci]] as Laura Johnson\n* [[Rachel Skarsten]] as Sharon\n* [[Vasanth Saranga]] as Bandhu\n\n}}\n\n==Production==\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| image1 = Christopher McDonald 2011 Shankbone (cropped).JPG\n| width1 = 105\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = \n| image2 = Eugene Levy 2012.jpg\n| width2 = 110\n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = \n| footer = [[Christopher McDonald]] (''left'') and [[Eugene Levy]] reprised their roles from ''[[American Pie Presents: The Naked Mile|The Naked Mile]]''\n}}\n\n''American Pie Presents: The Naked Mile'', the second installment of the [[American Pie Presents (film series)|''American Pie Presents'' film series]], was a commercial success, and [[Universal Studios|Universal Pictures]] prepared for a sequel.
