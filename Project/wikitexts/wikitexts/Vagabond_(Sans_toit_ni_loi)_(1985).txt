It tells the story of a young woman, a [[vagabond (person)|vagabond]], who wanders through the [[Languedoc-Roussillon wine]] country one winter. The film was the 36th highest-grossing film of the year with a total of 1,080,143 admissions in France.<ref name=\"JPBox Office\">{{cite web|url=http://www.jpbox-office.com/fichfilm.php?id=6419&affich=france|title=Sans to\u00eet ni loi (1985)- JPBox-Office|last=JP|website=www.jpbox-office.com}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nThe film begins with the contorted body of a young woman lying in a ditch, covered in frost. From this image, an unseen interviewer (Varda) puts the camera on the last men to see her and the one who found her. The action then flashes back to the woman, Mona, walking along the roadside, hiding from the police and trying to get a ride. Along her journey she takes up with other vagabonds as well as a Tunisian vineyard worker, a family of goat farmers, an [[agronomy]] professor, and a maid who envies what she perceives to be Mona's beautiful and passionate lifestyle. Mona explains to one of her temporary companions that at one time she was a secretary in Paris but became unsettled with the way she was living, choosing instead to wander the country, free from any responsibility. Her condition worsens until she finally falls where we first encounter her{{--}}in a ditch, frozen to death.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Sandrine Bonnaire]] as Mona Bergeron\n* [[Macha M\u00e9ril]] as Mme Landier\n* [[Yolande Moreau]] as Yolande\n* [[St\u00e9phane Freiss]] as Jean-Pierre\n* Setti Ramdane as Assoun\n* Francis Balch\u00e8re as Police\n* Jean-Louis Perletti as Police\n* Urbain Causse as Farmer\n* Christophe Alcazar as Farmer\n* Jo\u00ebl Fosse as Paulo\n* Patrick Schmit as Truck Driver\n* Daniel Bos as Demolition Worker\n* Katy Champaud as Girl at the Pump\n* Raymond Roulle as Old Man with Matches\n* Henri Fridlani as The Gravedigger\n* Patrick Sokol as Young Man with Sandwich\n* Pierre Imbert as Mechanic\n\n==Critical reception==\nThe movie was acclaimed by critics.

It also puns on ''sans toi'' (\"without you\").\n\n==Awards and nominations==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\" align=\"center\"\n|-\n! Award !! Category !! Name !!
