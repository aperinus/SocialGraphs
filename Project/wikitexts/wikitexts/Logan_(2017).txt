Working as a limousine driver in [[El Paso, Texas]], he and mutant tracker [[Caliban (Marvel Comics)|Caliban]] care of 90-year-old [[Charles Xavier (film series character)|Charles Xavier]], founder of the [[X-Men]], in an abandoned smelting plant in northern Mexico. Xavier suffers from [[dementia]] that causes him to have destructive [[telepathic]] seizures, one of which injured 600 people and killed several X-Men the year prior.\n\nLogan reluctantly agrees to escort Gabriela L\u00f3pez, a former nurse for biotechnology corporation Alkali-Transigen, and a young girl named [[X-23|Laura]] to Eden, a supposed refuge near the American-Canadian border. After finding Gabriela dead, Logan is confronted by her killer [[Donald Pierce]], who is Transigen's [[cyborg]] chief of security. Pierce is looking for Laura, who has stowed away in Logan's limo and has powers similar to his. She, Logan, and Xavier escape Pierce and his [[Reavers (comics)|Reavers]], but Caliban is captured. Pierce tortures Caliban into tracking Laura. Xavier and Logan watch a video on Gabriela's phone, revealing that Transigen created Laura and other children from mutant [[DNA]] to become weapons. The children proved challenging to control and were to be executed, but Gabriela and other nurses helped some escape. Xavier reveals to Logan that Laura was created from Logan's DNA and calls her Logan's daughter.\n\nIn [[Oklahoma City]], Logan discovers that Eden appears in Laura's ''X-Men'' [[American comic book|comic]] and tells her it is fictional. The Reavers arrive, but Xavier has a seizure which incapacitates everyone except Logan and Laura, who kill the attackers and inject Xavier with his medication. As they flee, Dr. [[Zander Rice]], the head of Transigen, arrives to help Pierce.\n\nLogan, Laura, and Xavier help farmer Will Munson and his family after a traffic incident, accepting an offer of dinner at their home, where Logan drives off enforcers from a corporate farm. Rice unleashes X-24, a mindless [[Human cloning|clone]] of Logan in his prime created as Transigen's ultimate weapon. X-24 murders Will's family and Xavier before capturing Laura. Caliban sets off grenades, killing himself and several Reavers but only injuring Pierce. Logan is outmatched by X-24, but Will pins X-24 with his truck before dying from his injuries. Logan and Laura escape with Xavier's body.\n\nAfter burying Xavier, Logan passes out. Laura takes him to a doctor and persuades him to prove that the site in North Dakota is not Eden. There, they find [[Rictor]] and other Transigen children preparing to cross into Canada. Laura finds an [[adamantium]] bullet that Logan has kept since he escaped from the [[Weapon X]] facility, which he once considered using to commit suicide. Logan decides not to accompany them, to Laura's dismay.\n\nWhen the Reavers ambush the children, Logan takes an overdose of a serum given to him by Rictor that temporarily enhances his healing abilities and boosts his strength. With Laura's help, he slaughters most of the Reavers before the serum wears off. As Pierce holds Rictor at gunpoint, Rice tells Logan, who killed Rice's father years ago at the Weapon X facility,{{efn|As depicted in ''[[X-Men: Apocalypse]]'' (2016).}} that no new mutants have been born due to genetically engineered crops created by Transigen and distributed through the world's food supply. Logan, having found a gun, shoots Rice dead and injures Pierce. X-24 fights Logan as the children combine their powers to kill Pierce and the remaining Reavers. Rictor uses his powers to flip a truck onto X-24, but he frees himself and impales Logan on a large tree branch. Laura loads Logan's revolver with the adamantium bullet and shoots X-24 in the head, killing him.\n\nNear death, Logan tells Laura not to become the weapon that she was made to be, and after she tearfully acknowledges him as her father, Logan dies peacefully in Laura's arms. She and the children bury Logan, and before they depart, Laura tilts the cross on his grave marker to create an X, honoring him as the last of the X-Men.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Logan Japan Premiere Red Carpet- Hugh Jackman (38445328406) (rotated).jpg|thumb|upright|Hugh Jackman's portrayal of Wolverine for 17 years in nine films earned him the ''[[Guinness World Records]]'' title for \"longest career as a live-action Marvel superhero\" in 2019.]]\n* [[Hugh Jackman]] as [[Logan (film character)|James Howlett / Logan / Wolverine]]: <br />The [[X-Men|X-Man]] and a physically-[[adamantium|enhanced]] mutant with accelerated healing.
