The film, an adaptation of the 1935 novel ''[[The Circus of Dr. Lao]]'' by [[Charles G. Finney]] adapted for the screen by [[Charles Beaumont]], details the visit of a magical circus to a small town in the [[southwestern United States]] and its effects on the townspeople.\n\n== Plot ==\nDr. Lao rides a golden [[donkey]] into the small town of Abalone, [[Arizona]] and visits Edward Cunningham's newspaper to place a large advertisement for his traveling circus, which will play for two nights only.\n\nThough quiet, Abalone is not peaceful. Wealthy rancher Clinton Stark has inside information that a railroad is coming to town and plans to buy the entire town while the land is cheap. Stark arrives at the newspaper offices to confront Cunningham about a recent editorial in opposition to Stark's plan. Lao, waiting to place his ad, silently listens to the meeting.\n\nAnother of Stark's opponents is Angela Benedict, a widow librarian and schoolteacher. Cunningham displays affection for her, embarrassing her in a visit to the library to research Lao's background, but she suppresses her reciprocal feelings.\n\nAt a town hall meeting, Stark announces that the town's 16-mile-long water-supply pipe is decaying and that a replacement would be prohibitively expensive. He offers to buy the entire town. Arguing against the offer, Cunningham introduces George G. George, a Navajo Indian who lives nearby in a town whose residents depend on Abalone's existence. Stark reluctantly allows the townspeople to ponder their choice until the next Friday night.\n\nThe next day, Cunningham confronts Lao at the circus site, arguing that Lao's hometown vanished centuries earlier. The mysterious Lao deflects Cunningham's questions. Later, Angela's young son Mike learns that Lao is 7,321 years old. When the circus opens, Lao uses his many faces to offer his wisdom, including those of Pan (the god of joy), the Great Serpent, [[Medusa]] and the magician Merlin.\n\nMike visits Lao seeking a job, displaying his novice [[juggling]] and [[Magic (illusion)|conjuring]] skills. Lao instead offers observations in the form of a poetic speech about the world, and life, as a circus.\n\nIt is learned that on the first night of the circus, Stark's henchmen destroyed the newspaper office. Angela is kept awake that night, plagued by the music that Pan played while nobody else can hear it.\n\nAt dawn, the newspapermen are astonished to discover that their office has been fully restored with the press operating. Attributing it to Lao, they rush to produce a short edition of the paper, which Cunningham delivers to Stark in the morning. When he visits the circus site, Lao offers encouragement and calls on Cunningham to keep faith.\n\nThat evening, Lao stages his grand finale, a [[magic lantern]] show that ends in explosions and darkness. The townspeople find themselves again in the library in a town meeting. A vote is called on Stark's proposal, and to the surprise of Cunningham, Benedict and Stark, it is rejected unanimously. Stark tells everyone about the coming railroad and Angela confesses her love to Cunningham.\n\nStark's henchmen are confused by their his apparent change of character and trash Lao's circus in a drunken spree, during which they break Dr. Lao's fishbowl. The fish inside it is revealed to be the [[Loch Ness Monster]], which balloons to enormous size when exposed to the open air. After it chases the two thugs away, Dr. Lao conjures rain to wet the monster and shrink it to its original size.\n\nMorning comes and the circus is gone, with only a red circle on the desert floor where the tent had been. At first Mike's reports of the previous night are disbelieved, but Stark finds the hat belonging to one of the henchmen. Mike chases a dust plume that seems to him to be the spirit of Dr. Lao. However, Mike finds only three wooden balls, which he juggles while summoning the spirit of Lao to observe.\n\nDr. Lao rides away as his advice from two nights earlier is repeated, reminding Mike that the circus of Dr. Lao is life itself, and that everything within it is a wonder.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Tony Randall]] as Dr. Lao, the Mysterious Visitor\n** as [[Merlin]], the Great Magician\n** as [[Pan (god)|Pan]], the God of Joy\n** as the Serpent\n** as [[Medusa]], the Fabled Monster\n** as [[Apollonius of Tyana]], the blind fortune teller\n** as the [[Abominable Snowman]]\n* [[Arthur O'Connell]] as Clint Stark, the Ruthless Tycoon\n* [[John Ericson]] as Ed Cunningham, the Crusading Publisher and the Transformed Pan\n* [[Barbara Eden]] as Angela Benedict, the Widowed Librarian\n* Kevin Tate as Mike Benedict, Angela's son\n* [[Noah Beery, Jr.]] as Sam, the Loyal Pressman\n* [[Royal Dano]] as Casey, the Brutal Henchman\n* [[John Doucette]] as Lucas, the Henchman's Sidekick\n* [[Lee Patrick (actress)|Lee Patrick]] as Mrs. Howard T.
