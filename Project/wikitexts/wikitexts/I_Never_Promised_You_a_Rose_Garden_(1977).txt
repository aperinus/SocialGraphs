After a suicide attempt, she lands in a mental institution, where the hostile environment threatens to destabilize her condition even further.

[[Bibi Andersson]] played Dr. Fried, while [[Kathleen Quinlan]] played Deborah. All references to Judaism were removed, including the storyline of the vicious cruelty Deborah suffered from anti-Semitic peers, so that her childhood bout with urethral cancer becomes the sole reason for Deborah's \"retreat from reality\".\n\nIn an interview, Greenberg stated that the references to Judaism were removed because the producers were \"terrified.\" The author added that the characterizations of mental illness in the film \"stank on ice.\"<ref>[http://www.gazette.com/articles/rose-28516-garden-mental.html Author can't shed legacy of 1964 novel 'Rose Garden'] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091114124639/http://www.gazette.com/articles/rose-28516-garden-mental.html |date=2009-11-14 }}, ''Colorado Springs Gazette'', October 15, 2007.</ref>\n\nDeborah's name is changed from Blau (which means \"blue\" in German, and parallels the author's pseudonym \"Green\") to Blake. Another major theme of the book, Deborah's artistic talent which flourished in spite of her illness, was reduced to a scene in which she scribbles childishly on a drawing pad. The Kingdom Of Yr is portrayed on-screen, as are some of its gods, but never seen in its original ethereal beauty, only the wasteland that it became much later.\n\nThe background music for the Yr sequences is a recording of a Balinese [[Kecak]], the ceremonial chant of the sacred monkeys from the [[Ramayana]].\n\nIn a 2006 interview, Greenberg recalled that she was not consulted on any aspect of the film, and was contacted only by [[Bibi Andersson]]. She recalled Andersson telling her that the producers had said Greenberg could not be consulted as she was \"hopelessly insane\".<ref>Interview with Claudia Cragg, [http://ccragg123.libsyn.com/index.php?post_id=440976 A Conversation with Joanne Greenberg].

The film received two [[Golden Globe]] nominations for Best Picture and Best Actress for Kathleen Quinlann.\n\n[[Roger Ebert]] gave the film three stars out of four and wrote, \"This is difficult material to bring to life, but a young actress named Kathleen Quinlan does it with heart and sensitivity. There were opportunities here for climbing the walls and chewing the scenery, I suppose, but her performance always finds the correct and convincing human note. And it's the skill with which Miss Quinlan (and Bibi Andersson) follow that thread of characterization that makes the movie work. Otherwise, those desert fantasies and all those feathers and fur might have been fatally distracting.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/i-never-promised-you-a-rose-garden-1977 |title=I Never Promised You a Rose Garden |last=Ebert |first=Roger |website=[[RogerEbert.com]] |access-date=April 26, 2019 }}</ref> [[Vincent Canby]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' stated, \"How Deborah, with the help of one remarkable doctor, is eventually able to recognize her own pain and thus come to some kind of terms with her demons is the moving substance of this film that leaves one almost as exhausted as the heroine.\" He also praised Kathleen Quinlan for \"a remarkably fine, contained performance as Deborah.
