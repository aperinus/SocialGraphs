One, a middle-aged, black insurance salesman named Doyle Gipson, a recovering alcoholic attending [[Alcoholics Anonymous]] meetings to stay sober, is en route to a hearing to argue for joint custody of his sons with his estranged wife. The other, a successful, young, white [[Wall Street]] [[Lawyer|attorney]] named Gavin Banek, is rushing to file a [[power of appointment]] document to prove a dead man signed his foundation over to Banek's law firm. Banek is distracted while driving on the [[FDR Drive]] and his [[Mercedes-Benz_CLK-Class#First_generation_(C208/A208;_1997%E2%80%932003)|2000 Mercedes-Benz CLK 430]]<ref>https://www.imcdb.org/vehicle_2421-Mercedes-Benz-CLK-430-C208-2000.html in Changing Lanes, Movie, 2002</ref> collides with Gipson's [[Toyota_Corolla_(E90)|1988 Toyota Corolla]].<ref>https://www.imcdb.org/vehicle_4025-Toyota-Corolla-AE92-1988.html 1988 Toyota Corolla [AE92] in Changing Lanes, Movie, 2002</ref> Banek tries to brush Gipson off with a [[blank check]], rather than exchanging insurance information, thereby disobeying the law. Gipson refuses to accept the check and voices his desire to \"do this right\", but Banek, whose car is still drivable, insists upon leaving immediately.  He leaves Gipson stranded, telling him, \"better luck next time\". After arriving to the court late, Gipson learns that the judge ruled against him in his absence, giving sole custody of the boys to Gipson's wife and allowing her to proceed with a plan to move to Oregon, never knowing that Gipson was about to buy a house locally and give it to his wife and children as part of his effort to make joint custody workable for everyone.\n\nWhen Banek gets to court, he realizes that he dropped the crucial power of appointment file at the scene of the accident, and the judge gives him until the end of the day to retrieve it. Gipson, who scooped up the file, is torn, and initially refuses to return the file. Banek, who is desperate to get his papers back, goes to a \"fixer\", a shady computer [[hacker (computer security)|hacker]], and gets him to switch off Gipson's credit, destroying Gipson's chance for a home loan to keep his family together. Gipson is distraught when he finds out his credit has been ruined and he comes close to drinking again. Determined to get back at Banek, Gipson removes several lug nuts from one of Banek's wheels, and Banek suffers some minor injuries after his car crashes on the highway. An infuriated Banek goes to the elementary school of Gipson's children and tells school officials that Gipson plans to kidnap the boys, so Gipson is arrested and jailed.  His enraged wife declares her intention to move forward with taking their sons to Oregon and says that Gipson will never see them again.\n\nBoth men, shaken by the consequences of their actions, start to reconsider their desire for vengeance and try to find a way out. Although it appears unlikely that either man will achieve what he had hoped, both resolve to let go and do what is right, and the two men apologize to each other. Gipson returns the file containing the power of appointment, which Banek has since learned was obtained illegally, and he uses it to blackmail his boss to conduct business honestly and get approval to represent Gipson pro bono to resolve his legal troubles. Banek also visits Gipson's wife, asking her to \"give me five minutes.\" The next day, Gipson is walking and notices his wife and sons standing across the street, smiling at him.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Ben Affleck]] as Gavin Banek\n* [[Samuel L.
