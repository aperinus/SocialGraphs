It was directed by [[Robert Aldrich]] (his final film) and stars [[Peter Falk]], [[Vicki Frederick]] and [[Laurene Landon]]. The [[Pittsburgh Steeler]] hall of famer [[Joe Greene (American football)|\"Mean\" Joe Greene]] plays himself.\n\nThe film is known outside the US as ''The California Dolls'' because \"All the Marbles\" is an American [[idiom]] which is largely unknown in other English speaking countries.<ref>CALIFORNIA DOLLS, The\nMonthly Film Bulletin; London Vol. 48, Iss. 564,  (Jan 1, 1981): 241.</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nHarry is the manager of a [[tag team]] of attractive female [[wrestlers]], Iris and Molly. On the road, they all endure a number of indignities, including bad motels, small-time crooks and a mud-wrestling match while trying to reach [[Reno, Nevada]], for a big event at the [[Grand Sierra Resort|MGM Grand Hotel]].\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Peter Falk]] as Harry\n* [[Vicki Frederick]] as Iris\n* [[Laurene Landon]] as Molly\n* [[Richard Jaeckel]] as Dudley\n* [[Burt Young]] as Eddie Cisco\n* [[John Hancock (actor)|John Hancock]] as John \"Big John\"\n* [[Faith Minton]] as \"Big Mama\"\n* [[Chick Hearn]] as Himself\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nAldrich said he wanted to make the film \"because nobody's done anything about women's wrestling before.\"<ref name=\"bob\">At the Movies: Peter O'Toole and a film they tried to ignore.

New York Times 9 Jan 1981: C20.</ref>\n\n\"It's purely, totally commercial,\" added Aldrich. \"It fits in with my philosophy, which is that the process is at best a craft, not art.\"<ref name=\"all\">ALDRICH WINS ALL THE MARBLES: [FIRST Edition]\nBruce McCabe Boston Globe 22 Feb 1981: 1.</ref>\n\nAldrich says he was brought the story by Mel Frohman \"and we stole the whole psychological drive and ending from Abe Polonsky's ''[[Body and Soul (1947 film)|Body and Soul]]'' (1947)\", a film on which Aldrich had been an assistant director.<ref name=\"film\"/>\n\nAldrich said the theme of that movie \"was that the biggest damage you can suffer is the loss of self-esteem and a fall from grace. The struggle to regain that esteem will fuel any plot. You don't even have to win.\"<ref name=\"film\"/> Aldrich says he also stole from ''Body and Soul'' for the last act of ''The Longest Yard''.<ref name=\"no\">MOVIES: ROBERT ALDRICH--NO MORE MR.

Los Angeles Times 11 Oct 1981: m25.</ref>\n\nAldrich said that \"''[[Rocky (film)|Rocky]]'' was ''Body and Soul'' except that an Italian fighter wins, and in the original, a Jewish fighter loses. We have here two girls and a manager of questionable credentials. All three have already fallen from grace, and they struggle to redeem their self esteem. Hopefully, it will take two funny hours to happen.\"<ref name=\"film\"/>\n\n[[Leigh Chapman]] did some uncredited work on the script for a week.<ref name=\"leigh\">{{Cite web|url=https://classictvhistory.wordpress.com/2015/11/17/lotsa-teeth-an-interview-with-leigh-chapman/|website=Classic TV History|date=17 Nov 2015|title=Lotsa Teeth: An Interview With Leigh Chapman}}</ref>\n\nThe film was financed by [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]] who had recent appointed [[David Begelman]] head of production and revitalized its movie-making operations. The film was announced in May 1980.<ref>LUCAS STRIKES BACK: FILM CLIPS SCHREGER, CHARLES. Los Angeles Times 28 May 1980: h1.</ref>\n\n===Casting===\nThe film needed a male star. \"I couldn't make ''Sister George'' in this market,\" said Aldrich around this time. \"I couldn't make ''Baby Jane'', ''Attack!'' or ''The Big Knife'' in this market. It used to be that the script was the big thing and the actor secondary. Now it's the star. And it's got to be a big star. Get Burt Reynolds and you can shoot the telephone book.\"<ref name=\"all\"/>\n \nAldrich says his son suggested Peter Falk, best known for ''Columbo''. \"I gave him the [[Bette Davis]] speech - a great hook for any actor,\" said Aldrich, referring to a technique he used to get Davis to star in ''Whatever Happened to Baby Jane''. \"It goes like this: 'Peter if this isn't the best script ever written for you put it in an envelope and sent it right back. But if it is the best, then lets make it. I don't want you to hear that you don't like that speech on page 16. It's either the best or it isn't. That rarely fails. You don't always get the picture made but you always get a positive reaction. Nobody's ego can withstand that sort of flattery.\"<ref name=\"no\"/>\n\nAldrich arranged a meeting with Falk and said he told him \"This picture will earn you more money than you've ever made before. Just don't try rewriting the script or changing things around like you do with your pal [[John Cassavetes]].\"<ref name=\"all\"/> [[Peter Falk]] signed to star in June.<ref>MOVIES / BY BRUCE MCCABE; ; FORGET THE BOOK - AND BE SEDUCED: McCabe, Bruce. Boston Globe 6 June 1980: 1.</ref>\n\nFor the female leads, Aldrich said \"We made the decision to take actresses and turn them into wrestlers instead of vice-versa. If we were right, it will make the picture.\"<ref name=\"film\"/> He auditioned women and tested 20.<ref name=\"no\"/>\n\nAmong the young unknown actresses who auditioned, but did not receive a part, was [[Kathleen Turner]]. However while Turner was in Los Angeles to audition for ''Marbles'' she also managed to secure an audition for ''[[Body Heat]]'', which turned her into a star.<ref>'BODY HEAT'--KATHLEEN TURNER CRANKS UP THE STEAM\nGreco, Mike. Los Angeles Times13 Sep 1981: k43.</ref>\n\nThe women auditioned for the female leads were narrowed to eight and were sent to wrestling school. (Another account says 12 actors were screen tested and four sent off to wrestling school).<ref name=\"wrestle\">AT THE MOVIES: [Review]\nChase, Chris. New York Times 23 Oct 1981: C.8.</ref>) Aldrich reportedly told the women \"the two that wrestle the best get the parts.\"<ref name=\"wrestle\"/>\n\nOne of the final women who auditioned was Vicki Fredrick, who appeared on Broadway in ''[[A Chorus Line]]'' and ''[[Dancin']]''. She remembers \"There was incredible tension,\" at the end. \"On graduation day, each girl did a five-minute match for the heads of MGM, and Mr. Aldrich and Peter Falk. Laurene Landon [a Canadian athletic fashion model] and I got the parts, and the other two girls didn't get anything. It was a win-lose situation. When Mr. Aldrich told me he wanted me to play Iris, he also said he wanted me to put on 10 pounds. 'You have a dancer's body,' he said, 'and you have to look like a lady wrestler.'\"<ref name=\"wrestle\"/>\n\n\"We picked the two best athletes,\" said Aldrich.<ref name=\"bob\"/> He did add that \"I think the public likes to see attractive people. I know I like to see attractive people. So if you're going to have two women wrestlers, why not have them attractive?\"<ref name=\"bob\"/>\n\nThe wrestlers were trained by the former women's world wrestling champion [[Mildred Burke]].<ref name=\"wrestle\"/>\n\n===Shooting===\nSecond unit photography began 5 November 1980. Principal photography took place from 14 November to 24 February 1981 on location in Youngstown and Akron, Ohio; Chicago; Las Vegas; Reno; and Los Angeles.<ref name=\"nat\">Nat Segaloff, ''Final Cuts: The Last Films of 50 Great Directors'', Bear Manor Media, 2013, pp. 20\u201321</ref><ref>Economics and Changing Public Interests Turn Midwest Into a Film-Making Center\nBy IVER PETERSON Special to The New York Times. New York Times 23 Nov 1980: 24.</ref> The last 19 days were just filming wrestling.<ref name=\"bob\"/>\n\nThe film was produced by Aldrich's son William. His daughter Adell was second unit director, and his son Kelly was transportation supervisor. \"This is not a very trustworthy town,\" said Aldrich. \"So when you do business, why not keep it in your own family?\"<ref name=\"bob\"/>\n\nFrederick later recalled filming the finale in Reno with 2,500 extras. \"They didn't quite know what we would be doing, and when the match started, they began screaming, and it was incredible. I forgot we were filming; it became real to me. I didn't hurt anybody, or hit them incorrectly, but I started really wanting to win. It was just like being back onstage. You hear the applause, and you think, 'Oh, good. I did well.'\"<ref name=\"wrestle\"/>\n\nAldrich said \"I hope this is going to be a fun picture, not a ''Big Knife'', but then I thought ''[[Emperor of the North Pole]]'' was a fun picture, but nobody saw it, so maybe I was wrong. I'm not so sure what a fun picture is anymore, just as I no longer know what fun is, at least in this town. There's no working class any more in the industry. Every grip owns two or three apartments. It's just a job now for everybody. They leave the set, go to the bank, and then go home. No fun anymore. Let's hope this one will be.\"<ref name=\"film\">Leo Roars Again Drew, Bernard.

When we were wrestling, we kept covering our breasts with the mud, or wrestling in the mud at the other girls to cover our breasts. We thought we got away with it. Well, we got a call from Aldrich the next morning in a rage. He was very angry that we didn't show our breasts. In addition to that, they struck the mud wrestling set the night before. He said 'I know what you two tricksters are up to. We're building the set all over again because of you two.' We had to go in there again and wrestle and show our breasts so to speak. I was mortified; I was so ashamed and embarrassed,\" Landon said.<ref>{{cite web |title=Laurene Landon spills all the marbles |work=slamwrestling.net |url=https://slamwrestling.net/index.php/2006/03/25/laurene-landon-spills-all-the-marbles/ |access-date=2022-01-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210112200425/https://slamwrestling.net/index.php/2006/03/25/laurene-landon-spills-all-the-marbles/ |archive-date=12 January 2021 }}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\nUnited Artists reportedly spent $7 million to promote the film.<ref>FILM CLIPS: WHO HAS THE RIGHT TO THE FINAL FILM CUP?
