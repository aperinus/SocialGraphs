Goyer|David Goyer]],<ref>Michael Eury, ''Captain Action: The Original Super-Hero Action Figure'' (2002), p. 77.</ref> and directed by [[Rod Hardy]], the film had a $6 million production budget. It stars [[David Hasselhoff]] as Fury, a retired super spy who is approached to return to duty to take down the terrorist organization [[Hydra (Marvel Comics)|HYDRA]], who threaten to attack [[Manhattan]] with a [[pathogen]] they have reconstituted known as the Death's Head virus. [[Lisa Rinna]] plays [[Valentina Allegra de Fontaine|Contessa Valentina \"Val\" Allegra de Fontaine]], and [[Sandra Hess]] plays [[Fenris (comics)|Andrea von Strucker]] / [[Viper (Madame Hydra)|Viper]]. It was released on DVD on September 30, 2008. The film was met with a largely negative reception.\n\n==Plot==\nAgents of the terrorist organization [[Hydra (comics)|HYDRA]] invade a [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] facility, killing [[Clay Quartermain]] and reviving a cryogenically preserved [[Baron Strucker|Baron Wolfgang Von Strucker]]. Nick Fury, retired, and living in an abandoned mine shaft in the Yukon, is approached by S.H.I.E.L.D. agents [[Alexander Goodwin Pierce]] and [[Valentina Allegra de Fontaine|Contessa Valentina Allegra De Fontaine]] to return to duty to take down Hydra, now led by the children of Von Strucker, an old enemy of his. Fury refuses to return until he learns of Quartermain's death. He then accompanies Pierce and De Fontaine to a S.H.I.E.L.D. [[Helicarrier]], where he reunites with old friends [[Dum Dum Dugan]] and [[Gabe Jones|Gabriel Jones]], is introduced to [[telepath]] [[Kate Neville]], clashes with new S.H.I.E.L.D. Director General Jack Pincer, and is shown advanced technologies that S.H.I.E.L.D. is developing, including a [[Life Model Decoy]] of Fury.\n\nShown a recording of Quartermain's death, with the killer taunting Fury by name, and informed that the killer was Von Strucker's daughter, codenamed Viper, Fury deduces that Von Strucker's body was taken to harvest a [[pathogen]] known as the Death's Head Virus, developed by [[Arnim Zola]] to be Hitler's doomsday weapon. Viper calls a meeting of the remaining four Hydra lieutenants from Cairo, Osaka, Prague and London. She executes the London lieutenant for questioning her authority. Fury learns that Zola is still alive and being kept in a S.H.I.E.L.D. [[safehouse]] in Berlin, Fury and De Fontaine travel there. They rendezvous with local Interpol agent Gail Runciter, and proceed to the safehouse, where an elderly Zola, in a wheelchair and requiring an oxygen mask, seemingly overpowers Kate Neville's telepathy with his evil visions of destruction. Runciter lures Fury away from the group and shocks him with a device before revealing herself to be Viper in disguise. She then kisses Fury with poisoned lipstick, leaving him unconscious, enabling Hydra to retake Zola. Fury learns he has 48 hours to live unless he can recover a sample of Viper's DNA from which to develop an antidote.\n\nHydra threatens to attack [[Manhattan]] with the virus, barring payment of US $1 billion, and as proof of their threat, the real Gail Runciter is found, dying from the virus. After Fury and his team brief the President of the United States, Pierce determines from a chip from a laptop sold in the [[Aleutian Islands]] that the Hydra base might be there. Fury has his people split into two teams, one led by de Fontaine heading to Manhattan to find the refrigerated truck they believe will be needed to deploy the virus, and the other with Fury leading Pierce and Neville to the Aleutian Islands. Upon arriving in the Aleutian Islands, and confirming that a Hydra transmission has come from there, Fury's plane is shot down by heat-seeking missiles. In Manhattan, de Fontaine's team figures out that the refrigerator truck is disguised as a garbage truck, while Fury and his team, having bailed out of the airplane in time, infiltrate the Hydra base.\n\nFury realizes that it was too easy to get in, just before his team is captured and stripped of their weapons. Viper reveals to him that she will release the virus even if they are paid, and locks Fury and his team in a freezer. Fury reveals that in place of his missing left eye, he keeps an explosive with which they are able to escape. Reaching Viper's control room, Fury and Viper fight until she gets hold of a gun and shoots him. However, it turns out to be Fury's Life Model Decoy. Fury incapacitates Zola and captures Viper, and Neville uses her telepathy to draw the code to abort the detonation from Viper's mind. The Helicarrier arrives, and captures the rest of Hydra's forces, but Viper escapes with the body of her father. Fury decides to return to S.H.I.E.L.D. to counter the new threat of Hydra, while Viper is shown to have restored her father, Baron Wolfgang Von Strucker, to life.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:N Fury.jpg|thumb|alt=Nick Fury as portrayed By David Hasselhoff.|David Hasselhoff as Nick Fury]]\n* [[David Hasselhoff]] as SHIELD Agent Colonel [[Nick Fury]]\n* [[Lisa Rinna]] as SHIELD Agent [[Valentina Allegra de Fontaine|Contessa Valentina 'Val' Allegra De Fontaine]]<ref>As spelled officially by Marvel Comics on [http://www.marvel.com/universe/S.H.I.E.L.D. its S.H.I.E.L.D. page], although misspelled with a male name and spelled with different Italian article as \"Valentina Allegro de Fontaine\" in her name's first two mentions, in ''Strange Tales'' #159, \"Spy School\", 10, panel 6, and ''Strange Tales'' #162, \"So Evil, the Night\" p.3, panel 6.</ref>\n* [[Sandra Hess]] as [[Fenris (comics)|Andrea Von Strucker]] / [[Viper (Madame Hydra)|Viper]]\n* [[Neil Roberts (actor)|Neil Roberts]] as SHIELD Agent [[Alexander Goodwin Pierce]]\n* [[Garry Chalk]] as SHIELD Agent [[Dum Dum Dugan|Timothy Aloysius 'Dum-Dum' Dugan]]\n* Tracy Waterhouse as SHIELD Agent [[Kate Neville]]\n* [[Tom McBeath]] as SHIELD Director General Jack Pincer\n* [[Ron Canada]] as SHIELD Agent [[Gabe Jones|Gabriel Jones]]\n* Adrian G.
