The film stars [[Mark Wahlberg]] and [[Mila Kunis]], with [[Joel McHale]] and [[Giovanni Ribisi]] in supporting roles, and MacFarlane providing the voice and [[motion capture]] of the title character. The film tells the story of John Bennett, a Boston native whose childhood wish brings his teddy bear friend Ted to life.

It was released in theaters in the United States on June 29, 2012, and was a box office hit, grossing $549.4 million against a $50\u201365 million budget. ''Ted'' was the highest-grossing comedy film of 2012, is the second highest-grossing R-rated comedy of all time (behind ''[[The Hangover Part II]]'') and was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Original Song]]. It received generally positive reviews, and successfully launched a [[Ted (franchise)|franchise]], with a [[Ted 2|sequel]] released in 2015, and a [[Ted (TV series)|prequel television series]] currently in development.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT the ideal length is 400-700 words. As of August 30, 2020, the word count should be 832 words. -->\nIn 1985, eight-year-old John Bennett is a friendless only child living in [[Norwood, Massachusetts]], a suburb of [[Boston]], who wishes for his new Christmas gift, a jumbo [[teddy bear]] named Ted, to come to life and become his best friend. The wish coincides with a shooting star and comes true, much to the brief horror of his parents; word spreads and Ted briefly becomes a celebrity.\n\n27 years later, John, now 35, and Ted are still living in Boston, and are still staunch companions enjoying a [[Hedonism|hedonistic]] life. John is dating Lori Collins whom he met at a dance club. As their fourth anniversary approaches, Lori hopes to marry John, but feels he can not move forward in life with Ted around. John is hesitant about making Ted leave, but he is persuaded to act when they find Ted at home with a group of prostitutes, with one [[Defecation|defecating]] on the floor, after their anniversary dinner.\n\nJohn finds Ted his own apartment and a job at a grocery store, where Ted begins dating his co-worker Tami-Lynn. Lori learns that John has been skipping work, using her as an excuse, to reluctantly continue to spend most of his time with Ted. John and Lori are invited to a party put on by Lori's womanizing manager Rex, but Ted lures John away to a party at his apartment with the pressured offer to meet [[Sam J. Jones]], the star of their favorite film, ''[[Flash Gordon (film)|Flash Gordon]]''. John intends to stay only a few minutes, but gets caught up in the occasion. Lori finds John there and tearfully breaks up with him. A furious John blames Ted for ruining his relationship with Lori and disowns him.\n\nJohn and Ted confront each other about their ruined friendship and then fight, but manage to reconcile after a violent brawl in John's hotel room (resulting in John being crushed by a television). To repair John's relationship with Lori, Ted arranges for an old lover, singer [[Norah Jones]], to help by having John express his love for Lori with a song during her concert that Lori and Rex attend. He does an off-key rendition of the ''[[Octopussy]]'' theme song, \"[[All Time High]]\", by [[Rita Coolidge]] and is booed offstage. Lori is touched by the attempt and returns to her apartment, where Ted confesses to his role in John's relapse and offers to leave them alone forever if she talks to John.\n\nLori is persuaded, but Ted is kidnapped by Donny, a [[Mental disorder|mentally unstable]] [[Stalking|stalker]] who idolized Ted as a child. Donny plans to make Ted into his brutish son Robert's new toy. Ted manages to reach a phone to contact John, but is immediately recaptured by Donny and Robert. Realizing that Ted is in danger, John and Lori locate Donny's residence and track him to rescue Ted. The chase leads to [[Fenway Park]], where John punches Robert, knocking him out, but during the chase, Ted is damaged and falls onto the field, ripped entirely in half. A police car arrives, forcing Donny to flee. John and Lori gather Ted's stuffing and Ted relays his wish that John be happy with Lori, before the magic in Ted fades away making him a normal teddy bear again.\n\nUnwilling to lose Ted, a distraught John and Lori rush back to her apartment and unsuccessfully attempt to repair Ted. Feeling sad about her part in the incident, Lori makes a wish on a shooting star while John is asleep. The next morning, Ted is revived as a result of the wish (though he pretends to be brain dead at first) and reunites with John and Lori, encouraging them to resume their relationship. John then finally proposes to Lori and she accepts. Sometime later, John and Lori are married (with Sam Jones as the presiding minister), and Ted comfortably accepts having a life of his own, as he and Tami-Lynn continued their love affair.\n\nAs the narrator of the film further stated: Sam Jones attempts to restart his career and moves into a studio apartment with [[Brandon Routh]] (who starred in [[Superman Returns|the \"god-awful Superman movie\"]]). Rex gives up his pursuit of Lori, falls into a deep depression, and dies of [[Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis|Lou Gehrig's disease]]. Donny gets arrested by the [[Boston Police Department]] for kidnapping Ted, but the charges are dropped because the situation was not realistic. Robert hires a personal trainer, loses a significant amount of weight, and goes on to become [[Taylor Lautner]].\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Mark Wahlberg]] as John Bennett, Ted's best friend who as a child wished he would come to life.

They also wanted it to have a PG-13 rating instead of an R, which MacFarlene, Sulkin, and Wild ended up writing a version of.
