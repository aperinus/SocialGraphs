The story had originally appeared in Vol. 3 of his ''[[Books of Blood]]'' series. The film focuses on a monstrous [[paganism|pagan]] [[deity]]'s bloody rampage through the Irish countryside, with the title alluding to the folklore monster [[Rawhead]]. Pavlou and Barker had previously worked together on [[Underworld (1985 film)|''Transmutations'']] (also known as ''Underworld'').\n\nThe film stars [[David Dukes]] in the lead role alongside Kelly Piper, [[Niall Toibin]], [[Cora Venus Lunny]] and [[Donal McCann]] in supporting roles. The film was given a limited release in the United States by [[Empire Pictures]] on 17 April 1987, and the same year it was released on [[VHS]] and [[LaserDisc]] by [[Vestron Video]]. In October 1999 the film was released on [[DVD]] by Geneon, and received two further releases, on 29 July 2003 and on 17 October 2017 in [[4K resolution|4K]] quality.\n\n==Plot==\nHoward Hallenbeck travels to Ireland to research items of religious significance. He goes to a rural church to photograph some graves. During a thunderstorm, lightning strikes a stone column in a field. The monster Rawhead Rex rises from the dirt.\n\nHoward meets Declan O'Brien, who directs him to Reverend Coot. The curious O'Brien approaches the altar and places his hand on it. Images flash before his eyes. This experience destroys O'Brien's sanity. Howard inquires about the church's parish records. Coot says he can arrange to have Howard look at them, but finds they have been stolen. O'Brien destroys his camera.\n\nA man arrives at the home of locals Dennis and Jenny. He discovers a traumatized Jenny. Police arrive. Rawhead drags Dennis's dead body through the forest and comes upon a trailer park. There he kills a teenager named Andy Johnson.\n\nOn the road again, Howard pulls over to let his daughter urinate by a tree. Hearing her scream, Howard and his wife rush to her; Howard's son stays in the van, alone. Rawhead kills Howard's son and takes the body into the woods. Infuriated by the police's unsuccessful efforts to track down Rawhead, Howard returns to the church. He discovers that there is a weapon shown in the stained glass window that can be used to defeat the monster. After Howard leaves, Coot curiously touches the altar but resists the temptations and images it shows him.\n\nRawhead arrives at the church to \"baptize\" O'Brien by urinating on him. A bewildered Coot goes outside to investigate the noise and sees Rawhead. Horrified, Coot flees inside the church and into the basement while Rawhead destroys everything inside. Coot finds the missing parish records, showing what appears to be some kind of blueprint of Rawhead. O'Brien catches Coot and forces him upstairs to be sacrificed to Rawhead. The police arrive at the church, but hesitate to open fire on Rawhead because he is carrying Coot. The brainwashed inspector dumps gasoline around the police cars and ignites it as they begin to shoot at Rawhead, killing all the police, including himself.\n\nHoward leaves his wife and daughter and goes back to the church, where a dying Coot tells him that Rawhead is afraid of something in the altar. Howard goes inside. O'Brien is burning books and is overpowered by Howard. Howard, by using a candle stick, opens the altar and gets to the weapon. O'Brien retreats to Rawhead to tell him. Howard tries to use the weapon, but it has no effect. In anger, Rawhead kills O'Brien by tearing out his throat.\n\nAs Rawhead tries to kill Howard, Howard's wife picks up the weapon. A ray of light comes out of the weapon and hits Rawhead, stopping Rawhead from killing Howard. Howard realizes that the weapon works only when wielded by a woman. The form of a woman appears from the stone and shoots electric rays through the stones and into Rawhead's body, knocking him to the ground. After more blasts, Rawhead is drained, allowing Howard to hit him with a shovel. Rawhead then falls through the ground and Howard's wife drops the weapon in with him. Rawhead is smashed under giant stones. Both Howard and his wife weep in light of it being over.\n\nThe boy from the trailer park places flowers on Andy Johnson's grave. As he walks away, Rawhead emerges from the ground and roars.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[David Dukes]] as Howard Hallenbeck\n* [[Kelly Piper]] as Elaine Hallenbeck\n* Ronan Wilmott as Declan O'Brien\n* [[Niall Toibin]] as Reverend Coot\n* [[Niall O'Brien (actor)|Niall O'Brien]] as Detective Inspector Isaac Gissing\n* [[Hugh O'Conor]] as Robbie Hallenbeck\n* [[Cora Venus Lunny|Cora Lunny]] as Minty Hallenbeck\n* Heinrich von Schellendorf as Rawhead Rex\n* [[Donal McCann]] as Tom Garron\n\n==Release==\nThe film was given a [[limited release]] theatrically in the United States by [[Empire Pictures]] in 1987.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} It was later released on [[VHS]] by [[Vestron Video]] that same year.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}\n\nThe film was released on [[DVD]] in the US by Geneon on 5 October 1999.

In an interview less than a year after the film's release, he explained, \"I think, generally speaking, the movie followed the beats of the screenplay. It's just that monster movies, by and large, are made by directorial 'oomph' rather than what's in the screenplay. I'd like to think the screenplay for ''Rawhead Rex'' had the possibility of having major thrills in it. I don't think it was quite pulled off.\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.clivebarker.info/rawheadrex.html|title=The Official Clive Barker Website - Rawhead Rex |website=www.clivebarker.info|access-date=2017-08-27}}</ref> In a 2004 interview, Barker said he wanted to do a remake of the film,<ref>{{cite web|title=Clive Barker Speaks -'Rawhead Rex' Being Remade?! |url=https://bloody-disgusting.com/news/2588/clive-barker-speaks-rawhead-rex-being-remade/|website=[[Bloody Disgusting]]|publisher=[[Cinedigm]] |date=September 29, 2004|access-date=10 September 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150617234118/https://bloody-disgusting.com/news/2588/clive-barker-speaks-rawhead-rex-being-remade/ |archivedate=June 17, 2015}}</ref> but nothing further came of this.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|0091829|Rawhead Rex}}\n* {{Allmovie|40387|Rawhead Rex}}\n* {{Rotten tomatoes|rawhead_rex|Rawhead Rex}}\n\n{{Clive Barker}}\n\n[[Category:1986 films]]\n[[Category:1986 horror films]]\n[[Category:British monster movies]]\n[[Category:Empire International Pictures films]]\n[[Category:Films based on works by Clive Barker]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Colin Towns]]\n[[Category:Films shot in County Wicklow]]\n[[Category:1980s monster movies]]\n[[Category:British supernatural horror films]]\n[[Category:Films based on short fiction]]\n[[Category:Irish horror films]]\n[[Category:1980s exploitation films]]\n[[Category:British splatter films]]\n[[Category:Splatter films]]\n[[Category:1980s English-language films]]\n[[Category:1980s British films]]\n[[Category:Folk horror films]]"}]}}}}
