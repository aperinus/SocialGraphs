An international co-production of South Africa, Botswana, and the United States, ''The Gods Must Be Crazy II'' was produced by the [[Weintraub Entertainment Group]]. It was released by [[Columbia Pictures]] in the United States on 13 April 1990, and was released in the rest of the world by [[20th Century Fox]].\n\n==Plot==\nThe film has four storylines, which run in parallel and interact:\n#Xixo trying to find his lost children\n#Two elephant poachers travelling in a truck on which Xixo's children are stuck\n#A zoologist and a lawyer stranded in a desert\n#Two soldiers fighting each other\n\nThe story starts with two elephant poachers, the chronically mean \"Big Ben\" Brenner and his affable but not-very-bright assistant George, crossing the area in which Xixo's tribe lives. Curious about their vehicle, Xixo's son Xiri and daughter Xisa climb into the water tank trailer and are taken for an involuntary ride as the poachers continue. Xixo follows on foot, determined to retrieve his children.\n\nDr. Ann Taylor, a young lawyer from [[New York City]], arrives at a bush resort to give a lecture at a legal conference. Since she has spare time, she accepts the invitation of a young man to take a joyride in a two-seat, twin engine [[Ultralight aviation|ultralight aircraft]]. They go to see scientist Dr. Stephen Marshall, who has just been radioed that he must report to the resort where Dr. Taylor just came from to tend to a wounded animal they have found. Leaving the other pilot to watch his truck and equipment, he heads for the resort in the ultralight with Ann aboard, but encounter severe weather and crash, stranding them in the [[Kalahari desert]]. In addition, [[Angolan Civil War|war is brewing]], personified by a lost [[Cuba]]n soldier (Mateo) and his [[Angola]]n enemy (Timi), who repeatedly attempt to take each other prisoner.\n\nIn the course of the movie, all these people cross paths with Xixo and/or his children. Finally, the plot culminates in the poachers capturing Xixo, Taylor, Marshall, and the two soldiers. Xixo manages to save them, and George, who is actually a nice guy kept under the heel of his boss, gives Xixo directions to his children. The poachers are captured, both soldiers come to somewhat reluctant terms and part without further violence, Taylor and Marshall return to civilization (though not without a last embarrassing accident), entering into a romantic relationship, and Xixo finds his children.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[N!xau \u01c2Toma|N!xau]] as Xixo\n*Eiros as Xiri\n*Nadies as Xisa\n*[[Hans Strydom (actor)|Hans Strydom]] as Dr. Stephen Marshall\n*[[Lena Farugia]] as Dr. Ann Taylor\n*Erick Bowen as Mateo\n*Treasure Tshabalala as Timi\n*[[Pierre van Pletzen]] as George\n*Lourens Swanepoel as \"Big Ben\" Brenner\n*Dawid Kruiper as Oom Dawid\n\n== Reception ==\nThe film received mixed reviews from critics.
