When a U.S. Marshal has to break up a drug smuggling gang, he has to take to the skies.<ref>Floyd 2004, p. 329.</ref> ''Drop Zone'' was released by [[Paramount Pictures]] in the United States on December 9, 1994.\n{{TOC limit|limit=2}}\n\n==Plot==\nAboard a commercial [[Boeing 747]] airliner, [[United States Marshals Service|U.S. Marshals]] brothers Terry and Pete Nessip are escorting computer expert Earl Leedy to a high-security prison. When an apparent terrorist hijack attempt blows a hole in the airliner, Terry is sucked out falling more than 30,000 feet to his death, and the terrorists parachute out of the same hole, taking Leedy with them.\n\nEx-[[Drug Enforcement Administration|DEA]] agent and renegade skydiver Ty Moncrief is the mastermind behind the attack, which culminated in the first ever parachute jump from a commercial jet at 30,000 feet. Ty plans to use Leedy to hack into the DEA mainframe computer in [[Washington, D.C.]] so Ty can auction off the names of undercover agents to drug cartels worldwide. Ty has scheduled this to be accomplished during an [[Independence Day (United States)|Independence Day]] parachute exhibition and fireworks display, which is the one day every year when security is loosened around the airspace above D.C.\n\nPete believes that the hijacking may have been an elaborate prison break meant to free Leedy. However, the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] declares that sneaking a parachute through airport security is impossible, and that parachuting at the jet's altitude and speed is not survivable. A devastated Pete is blamed for overreacting to the incident, and forced to turn in his badge.\n\nUndeterred, Pete consults a [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] [[high-altitude military parachuting]] instructor who confirms that he and his team have parachuted from that height and speed, but also states that the high-density metal rings in the parachutes would not pass airport metal detectors and that the operation required either rare skills or suicidal recklessness. The instructor believes the world class skydiver Don Jagger could perform the jump, but does not know his current whereabouts. Pete is instead referred to Jagger's reckless ex-girlfriend, ex-con Jessie Crossman, who runs a skydiving school in the [[Florida Keys]]. Jessie, who is unaware that Jagger is part of Ty's crew, agrees to train Pete how to skydive, if he will sponsor her team for the parachute exhibition.\n\nSoon after, Jagger is found dead, tangled in some high voltage power lines, after his identity was exposed by a passenger during the hijacking. Jessie breaks into the police impound to examine Jagger's parachute, declares that his death was a murder engineered by Ty, and swears revenge. Pete inquires as to the parachute's lack of metal, which Jessie explains is a custom \"smuggler's rig\" made with high density fabrics to deter detection.\n\nWhen Pete discovers Ty's plan to hack into the DEA mainframe, the rest of the parachuting team agrees to help Pete with the situation. Jessie's parachuting friend Selkirk is severely injured after using a faulty parachute that Ty had intended for Jessie to use.\n\nOn the night of the Independence Day exhibition, Jessie sneaks into Ty's parachuting aircraft, holding them at gunpoint in order to determine an explanation for Jagger's death. But Ty's men kick her outside and then parachute out. Jessie, managing to grab hold of the aircraft door bar, lets go on a free fall just as Pete and the parachuting team arrive and rescue her, floating down safety to the roof of the DEA mainframe office building where Ty has already arrived.\n\nPete tries to find access to the DEA mainframe control room, eliminating Ty's men one by one, with the help of the parachuting team. He breaks in and holds Leedy (who has already started downloading the identities) as hostage. Ty, having kidnapped Jessie, appears and threatens to kill her unless Pete releases Leedy. A fight breaks out between Pete and Ty that results in both of them falling out the building window.\n\nLuckily, Pete opens his emergency parachute as Ty tumbles to his death. Pete lands safely on the ground and is escorted away by paramedics, but spots Leedy wearing a DEA jacket leaving the scene. One of the team members, Swoop, leaps from the building, parachuting down onto Leedy and stopping him in his tracks. Pete tells Jessie jokingly that he would try skydiving again in 40 or 50 years.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Wesley Snipes]] as U.S. Marshal Pete Nessip\n* [[Gary Busey]] as Ty Moncrief\n* [[Yancy Butler]] as Jessie Crossman\n* [[Malcolm-Jamal Warner]] as U.S. Marshal Terry Nessip\n* [[Kyle Secor]] as \"Swoop\"\n* [[Rex Linn]] as Robby Walker\n* [[Sam Hennings]] as Torski\n* [[Grace Zabriskie]] as Winona Santoro\n* [[Corin Nemec]] as Selkirk \"Selly\" Power\n* [[Claire Stansfield]] as Kara Sellar\n* [[Mickey Jones]] as \"Deuce\"\n* [[Robert LaSardo]] as \"Deputy Dog\"\n* [[Michael Jeter]] as Earl Leedy\n* [[Andy Romano]] as U.S. Marshals Deputy Director Tom McCracken\n* [[Luca Bercovici]] as Don Jagger\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n{{Anchor|Development}}\nThe original idea came from two professional skydivers, Tony Griffin and [[Guy Manos]].
