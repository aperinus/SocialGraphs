It is the sixth feature film based on the 1966\u20131969 ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]]'' television series. Taking place after the events of ''[[Star Trek V: The Final Frontier]]'', it is the final [[Star Trek (film series)|film]] featuring the entire main cast of the television series. The destruction of the Klingon moon ''Praxis'' leads the [[Klingon Empire]] to pursue peace with their longtime adversary, the [[United Federation of Planets|Federation]]; the crew of the Federation starship [[USS Enterprise (NCC-1701-A)|USS ''Enterprise'']] must race against unseen conspirators with a militaristic agenda.\n\nAfter the critical and commercial disappointment of ''The Final Frontier'', the next film was initially planned as a prequel, with younger actors portraying the crew of the ''Enterprise'' while attending [[Starfleet Academy]]. The idea was discarded because of negative reaction from the original cast and the fans. Faced with producing a new film in time for ''Star Trek''{{'}}s 25th anniversary, director Nicholas Meyer and [[Denny Martin Flinn]] wrote a script based on a suggestion from [[Leonard Nimoy]] about what would happen if \"[[Berlin Wall|the Wall]] came down in space\", touching on the contemporary events of the [[Cold War]].\n\nPrincipal photography took place between April and September 1991. Because of a lack of sound stage space on the [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]] lot, many scenes were filmed around Hollywood. Meyer and cinematographer [[Hiro Narita]] aimed for a darker and more dramatic mood, altering sets originally used for the television series ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]''. Producer [[Steven-Charles Jaffe]] led a [[second unit]] to an Alaskan glacier that stood in for a Klingon gulag. [[Cliff Eidelman]] produced the film's score, which is intentionally darker than previous ''Star Trek'' offerings.\n\n''Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country'' was released in North America on December 6, 1991. It garnered positive reviews, with publications praising the lighthearted acting, setting and facetious references, and performed strongly at the box office. It posted the largest opening weekend gross of the series before going on to earn $96.8 million worldwide.<ref name=\"boxofficemojo\"/> The film earned two [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] nominations, for [[Academy Award for Best Makeup and Hairstyling|Best Makeup]] and [[Academy Award for Best Sound Editing|Best Sound Effects]], and is the only ''Star Trek'' movie to win the [[Saturn Award for Best Science Fiction Film]]. The film has been released on various home media formats, including a special collectors' edition in 2004, to which Meyer made minor alterations to the film.\n\n==Plot==\n[[File:St6-excelsior and shock wave.png|thumb|upright=1.25|The USS ''Excelsior'' weathers the shock wave generated by the explosion of Praxis.<ref name=\"Martin_1992-02\"/>{{rp|46}}]]\nIn 2293, a shock wave strikes the starship USS ''Excelsior'', commanded by Captain [[Hikaru Sulu]], who discovers that Praxis, a [[Klingon]] moon, has been destroyed. The loss of Praxis and the destruction of the Klingon homeworld's [[ozone layer]] throws the Klingon Empire into turmoil. The Klingons can no longer afford war with the [[United Federation of Planets]], so they pursue peace. [[Starfleet]] sends the [[USS Enterprise (NCC-1701-A)|USS ''Enterprise''-A]] to meet with the Klingon Chancellor Gorkon and escort him to negotiations on Earth. Captain [[James T. Kirk]], whose son [[David Marcus (Star Trek)|David]] was murdered by Klingons, opposes conciliation and resents the assignment.\n\n''Enterprise'' and Gorkon's battlecruiser rendezvous and continue towards Earth, with the two command crews sharing a tense meal aboard ''Enterprise''. Later that night, ''Enterprise'' appears to fire torpedoes at the Klingon ship, disabling its [[artificial gravity]]. During the confusion, two men wearing Starfleet spacesuits beam aboard the Klingon ship, kill two Klingon crew and mortally wound Gorkon before escaping. Kirk surrenders to avoid armed conflict and beams aboard the Klingon ship with Doctor [[Leonard McCoy]] in an attempt to save Gorkon's life. The chancellor dies, and Gorkon's chief of staff, [[Chang (Star Trek)|General Chang]], arrests and tries Kirk and McCoy for his assassination. The pair are found guilty in the trial and sentenced to [[life imprisonment]] on the frozen planetoid Rura Penthe. Gorkon's daughter Azetbur becomes the new chancellor, and continues diplomatic negotiations; for the sake of security, the conference is relocated and the new location is kept secret. While several senior Starfleet officers want to rescue Kirk and McCoy, the Federation President refuses to risk full-scale war, even if the Federation stands a good chance of winning.<!-- source: Director's Cut --> Azetbur likewise refuses to invade Federation space.\n\nKirk and McCoy arrive at the Rura Penthe mines and are befriended by a [[shapeshifting|shapeshifter]] named Martia, who offers them an escape route; in reality, it is a ruse to make their arranged deaths appear accidental. Once her betrayal is revealed, Martia transforms into Kirk's double and fights him, but is killed by the prison guards to silence any witnesses. Kirk and McCoy are beamed aboard ''Enterprise'' by Captain [[Spock]], who had assumed command and undertaken an investigation in Kirk's absence. Determining that ''Enterprise'' did not fire the torpedoes and that the assassins are still aboard, the crew has begun a search for them. The two assassins are found dead, killed by yet another unknown accomplice. To bait the third accomplice, Kirk and Spock announce to the ship that the assassins are still alive and will be interrogated. When the culprit arrives in [[sick bay]] to finish them off, Kirk and Spock discover that the killer is Spock's prot\u00e9g\u00e9, [[Valeris]]. To discover the identity of the other conspirators, Spock initiates a forced [[mind-meld]], and learns that a cabal of Federation, Klingon, and [[Romulan]] officers conspired to sabotage the peace talks. The torpedoes that struck Gorkon's cruiser came from Chang's ship which has the unique ability to fire its weapons while [[cloaking device|cloaked]].\n\n''Enterprise'' and ''Excelsior'' race to Khitomer, the location of the peace talks. Chang's cloaked ship attacks and inflicts heavy damage on both ships. At the suggestion of [[Uhura]], Spock and McCoy modify a torpedo to home in on the exhaust emissions of Chang's ship. The torpedo impact reveals Chang's location, and ''Enterprise'' and ''Excelsior'' destroy his ship with a volley of torpedoes. The crew from both ships beam to the conference and thwart an attempt on the Federation President's life.\n\nStarfleet Command orders ''Enterprise'' to return to Earth to be decommissioned. Kirk decides to take his ship on one last cruise and notes in his log that a new ship and crew will carry on their legacy.<ref name=\"synopsis\">{{cite web|url=https://www.startrek.com/database_article/star-trek-vi-the-undiscovered-country|title=Movie Detail: Star Trek VI Synopsis|work=StarTrek.com|publisher=Viacom|access-date=January 21, 2009|archive-date=July 18, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100718062914/http://www.startrek.com/database_article/star-trek-vi-the-undiscovered-country|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Cast==\n''The Undiscovered Country'' includes the final group appearance of the major cast members from the original television series, plus new actors and characters. Casting director [[Mary Jo Slater]] loaded the film with as many Hollywood stars as the production could afford, including a minor appearance by [[Christian Slater]], her son. Meyer was interested in casting actors who could project and articulate feelings, even through alien makeup.<ref name=\"Altman_1992-04\"/>{{rp|47}} Producer [[Ralph Winter (producer)|Ralph Winter]] said, \"We were not looking for someone to say 'Okay, I'll do it', but people who were excited by the material [...] and would treat it as if it [were] the biggest picture ever being made.\"<ref name=\"Altman_1992-04\"/>{{rp|51}}\n* [[William Shatner]] as [[James T. Kirk]], the captain of the USS ''Enterprise''. Despite his personal misgivings against the Klingons for killing his son, he is ordered to escort the Klingon High Chancellor to Earth. Shatner felt that though dramatic, the script made Kirk look too prejudiced.<ref name=\"special features-stories\"/>\n* [[Leonard Nimoy]] as [[Spock]], the ''Enterprise''{{'}}s science officer and second-in-command. Spock first opens negotiations with the Klingons after the destruction of Praxis and volunteers Kirk and the ''Enterprise'' to escort Chancellor Gorkon to Earth. This mission is to be his final as a Starfleet officer, and he begins training Valeris as a replacement.\n* [[DeForest Kelley]] as [[Leonard McCoy]], the chief medical officer of the ''Enterprise''. Kelley's appearance as McCoy in ''The Undiscovered Country'' was to be his last live action role before his death in 1999. With Leonard Nimoy the film's executive producer, the 71-year old Kelley was paid US$1&nbsp;million for the role, assuring a comfortable retirement for the actor. Kelley and Shatner shot their prison scenes over the course of six to eight nights; the two actors got to know each other better than they ever had.<ref name=\"Rioux_2005\"/>{{rp|298\u2013304}}\n* [[James Doohan]] as [[Montgomery Scott]], chief engineer aboard ''Enterprise''. Scott discovers the assassins' clothing hidden in the dining room shortly before the two men are found dead.\n* [[George Takei]] as [[Hikaru Sulu]], captain of the USS ''Excelsior''; despite having taken his own command, Sulu remains loyal to his old friends aboard the ''Enterprise''. ''The Undiscovered Country'' marked the first [[Star Trek canon|canonical]] mention of Sulu's first name, which was first mentioned in [[Vonda McIntyre]]'s novel ''[[The Entropy Effect]]''.<ref>{{cite book|title=[[The Entropy Effect]]|last=McIntyre|first=Vonda N.|author-link=Vonda McIntyre|isbn=0671836927|date=June 1981|publisher=[[Pocket Books]]}}</ref> It was included when [[Peter David]], author of the film's [[comic book]] adaptation, visited the set and convinced Nicholas Meyer to insert it.<ref>{{Cite magazine|date=March 2006|title=The Comics Buyer's Guide|magazine=[[Comics Buyer's Guide]]|issue=1614|page=10}} The film included the first live-action, canonical reference to Kirk's middle name, Tiberius.

Chekov finds Klingon blood by the transporter pads, leading Spock to widen his search of the ship.\n* [[Nichelle Nichols]] as [[Uhura]], the ''Enterprise''{{'}}s communications officer. Uhura was supposed to give a dramatic speech in Klingon during the film, but midway through production the speech was scrapped and a scene where Uhura is speaking garbled Klingon while surrounded by books was added for extra humor. Nichols protested the scene, wondering why there were still books in the 23rd century, but accepted the change since it would be the last ''Star Trek'' film she would appear in. Being African-American, Nichols was uncomfortable with some of the dialogue's racial undertones. Nichols was originally to speak the line \"[[Guess Who's Coming to Dinner|Guess who's coming to dinner]]\" as the Klingons arrive on the ''Enterprise''; Nichols refused to say the line, which was given to Koenig's character in the final print.<ref name=\"Nichols_1994\"/> Nichols also refused to say the line \"yes, but would you like your daughter to marry one [a Klingon]\", and it was dropped from the film altogether.<ref name=\"special features-stories\"/>\n* [[Kim Cattrall]] as [[Valeris]], the ''Enterprise''{{'}}s new helmsman and the first Vulcan to graduate at the top of her class at [[Starfleet Academy]]. Valeris becomes the prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Captain Spock, who intends her to be his replacement. Initially, the character of [[Saavik]], who appeared in the second through fourth ''Star Trek'' films, was intended to be the traitor, but Gene Roddenberry objected to making a character loved by fans into a villain. Cattrall was unwilling to be the third actress to play Saavik (a part she had originally auditioned for), but accepted the role when it became a different character.<ref name=\"okuda\" /> Cattrall chose the [[Eris (mythology)|Eris]] element of the character's name, for the Greek goddess of strife, which was Vulcanized by the addition of the \"Val\" at the behest of director Nicholas Meyer.<ref>{{cite journal|title=A Very Logical Gal|author=Anders, Lou|journal=[[Star Trek Magazine|Star Trek Monthly]]|date= March 1996|publisher=[[Titan Magazines]]}}</ref> During filming, Cattrall participated in a photo shoot on the empty ''Enterprise'' bridge, where she wore nothing but her Vulcan ears.

When Flinn originally developed the character, he had in mind a space pirate which he described as the \"dark side of [[Han Solo]]\". Flinn imagined an actress like [[Sigourney Weaver]] in the role, who was \"as different as night and day\" from Iman.<ref name=\"Altman_1992-04\"/>{{rp|51}} Meyer described Martia as \"Kirk's dream woman\", and when the makeup artists learned Iman was cast for the role they decided to enhance her graceful bird-like appearance with feathers. Yellow contact lenses completed the look.<ref name=\"Martin_1992-02\"/>{{rp|55\u20137}}\n* [[Brock Peters]] as [[List of Star Trek characters: A-F#C|Admiral Cartwright]], a high-ranking officer in Starfleet who vehemently protests Klingon immigration into Federation space. Peters had previously appeared as the Admiral in ''[[Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home|The Voyage Home]]''.<ref name=\"okuda\"/> Meyer had Peters return partly on the basis of his acting as the wrongly convicted black man Tom Robinson in ''[[To Kill a Mockingbird (film)|To Kill a Mockingbird]]''. Meyer thought that Cartwright's vitriolic speech would be particularly chilling and meaningful coming from the mouth of a recognized minority. The content of the speech was so repugnant to Peters that he was unable to deliver it in one take.<ref name=\"special features-stories\"/> Peters later portrayed [[Joseph Sisko]], the father of lead character [[Benjamin Sisko]] on ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine]]''.\n* [[Ren\u00e9 Auberjonois]] as Colonel West, the would-be assassin of the Federation president. Meyer was a friend of Auberjonois and offered him a chance to cameo months before filming. His part was cut from the theatrical version but reinstated on home video.<ref name=\"Dillard_1994\"/>{{rp|173}} Auberjonois later portrayed security chief Odo on the series ''Star Trek: Deep Space Nine''.\n* [[Michael Dorn]] as Colonel Worf, the Klingon attorney who represents Kirk and McCoy in their show trial for the death of Gorkon. He later unmasks the Klingon assassin at Khitomer as Colonel West (in the footage cut from the theatrical version but reinstated on home video). The character is the grandfather of [[Worf]], the character Dorn played on ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]''.\n\n==Production==\n\n===Development===\n''The Final Frontier'', the previous film in the series, was a critical and financial disappointment; the cast and crew were worried that the franchise would not be able to recover from the blow.<ref name=\"special features-stories\"/> With the looming 25th anniversary of [[Star Trek: The Original Series|the original series]] in 1991, producer [[Harve Bennett]] revisited an idea [[Ralph Winter (producer)|Ralph Winter]] had for the fourth film: a prequel featuring young versions of Kirk and Spock at [[Starfleet Academy]]. The prequel was designed to be a way of keeping the characters, if not the actors, in what was called \"''[[Top Gun]]'' in outer space\".<ref name=\"special features-stories\"/> Bennett and ''The Final Frontier'' writer David Loughery wrote a script entitled ''The Academy Years'', where Dr. [[Leonard McCoy]] talks about how he met Kirk and Spock while addressing a group of Academy graduates. The script shows Kirk and Spock's upbringing, their meeting McCoy and [[Montgomery Scott]] at the Academy and defeating a villain before parting ways. The script would have established that George Kirk, James T. Kirk's father, was a pilot who went missing\u2014presumed dead\u2014during a warp experiment with Scott. The script is set before the \"enlightenment\" of the Federation; slavery and racism are common, with Spock being bullied because he is the only Vulcan student.

McCoy is drunk at a posh medical dinner; Scott is teaching Engineering while the Bird of Prey from ''The Voyage Home'' is pulled from San Francisco Bay; Uhura hosts a call-in radio show and is glad to escape; and Chekov is playing chess at a club.<ref name=\"Altman_1992-04\"/>{{rp|24\u20135}}\n\nThe opening was rejected as too expensive to film;<ref name=\"special features-stories\">{{cite AV media|people=''Star Trek'' cast and crew|date=January 27, 2004|title=Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country, Special Collectors Edition: Special Features; \"Six Stories from Star Trek VI\"|publisher=[[Paramount Pictures]]|medium=DVD; Disc 2/2}}</ref> Flinn mentioned the exotic locales would have pushed the budget to $50&nbsp;million.<ref name=\"meyer\"/> While they tried to hold on to the opening as long as they could, Paramount threatened to cancel pre-production unless a few million dollars were cut from the budget.<ref name=\"Altman_1992-04\"/>{{rp|25}}\n\nThe script was finished by October 1990, five months after Nimoy was approached to write the story. Several months were spent working out the budget; because of the disappointing box office returns of ''The Final Frontier'', Paramount wanted to keep the sixth film's budget approximately the same as the previous installment, although the script called for space battles and new aliens.<ref name=\"Hughes_2008\"/>{{rp|38}} Shatner, Nimoy, and Kelley's salaries were cut with the understanding that they would share in box office profits. Meyer estimated that almost two months were spent fighting with the studio about the budget. \"To some degree, almost every area of the production was affected by the cuts\u2014but the script was the one thing that did not become a casualty,\" Meyer said.<ref name=\"Martin_1992-02\"/>{{rp|41}} The original budget hovered around $41&nbsp;million. While not expensive for a Hollywood production, this would have presented a risk due to ''Star Trek'' films' niche audience and lower international appeal. The final budget came in at $30&nbsp;million.<ref name=\"budget\"/><ref> Hauk, Dennis, ''Captain Quirk'' (1995), p. 212 </ref>\n\n''Star Trek'''s creator, [[Gene Roddenberry]], who wielded significant influence despite his ill health, hated the script.<ref name=\"Rioux_2005\"/>{{rp|302}} Meyer's first meeting with Roddenberry resulted in Meyer storming out of the room within five minutes. As with Meyer's previous ''Star Trek'' film (''The Wrath of Khan''), the script had strong military overtones, with a naval theme present throughout. Far from being idealized, the characters were shown as bigoted and flawed. In contrast to Roddenberry's vision of the future, Meyer thought there was no evidence that bigotry would disappear by the 23rd century.<ref name=\"meyer\"/> When Roddenberry protested about the villainization of [[Saavik]], Meyer replied that \"I created Saavik. She was not Gene's. If he doesn't like what I plan on doing with her, maybe he should give back the money he's made off my films. Maybe then I'll care what he has to say.\"<ref name=\"Rioux_2005\"/>{{rp|303}} After the stormy first meeting, a group including Meyer, Roddenberry, and producer Ralph Winter discussed the revised draft. Roddenberry would voice his disapproval of elements of the script line by line, and he and Meyer would square off about them while Winter took notes. Overall, the tone of the meeting was conciliatory, but the producers ultimately ignored many of Roddenberry's concerns.<ref name=\"Alexander_1995\"/>{{rp|588\u2013590}} By February 13, 1991, the film was officially put into production with the agreement it would be in theaters by the end of the year.<ref name=\"Hughes_2008\"/>{{rp|38}}\n\n===Design===\n[[File:Hiro narita.jpg|thumb|right|Cinematographer Hiro Narita]]\nAs he had when he directed ''The Wrath of Khan'', Meyer attempted to modify the look of ''Star Trek'' to fit his vision. Cinematographer [[Hiro Narita]]'s previous work had been on effects films such as ''[[The Rocketeer (film)|The Rocketeer]]'', where he had time and money to make a lavish period fantasy; with ''The Undiscovered Country'', he was constantly under time and budgetary pressures.<ref name=\"Magid_1992-02\"/>{{rp|42}} Though Narita confessed that he knew nothing about ''Star Trek'', Meyer replied that he did not want him to have any preconceived notions about the look of the series.<ref name=\"special features-stories\"/>\n\nVisual effects supervisor Scott Farrar said that Narita did a \"good job of keeping [the set] dark. When you get into a stage situation of aluminum walls and shiny metal, it can be a problem. But by keeping the light down, you see a little less and it becomes more textural. Hiro was very keen to avoid that over-bright stage look.\"<ref name=\"Martin_1992-02\"/>{{rp|46}} The budget meant that many of the ''Enterprise'' sets were redresses of those used in ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]''.<ref name=\"Reeves-Stevens_1995\"/> Meyer and production designer [[Herman Zimmerman]] were only able to make minor adjustments to these sets, as the television series was still in production at the time of filming.\n\nThe set used for Spock's quarters was the same as the one for Kirk's, but with the addition of a central column. The set was being used at the time for [[Data (Star Trek)|Data]]'s room in ''The Next Generation'', and had originally been built as Kirk's quarters for ''[[Star Trek: The Motion Picture]]'' in 1979.<ref name=\"okuda\"/> The transporter room set was also reused from ''The Next Generation'', with alterations that included the addition of a glowing pattern along the transporter's walls inspired by one of Zimmerman's sweaters; the set had previously been used on ''The Final Frontier''. The galley was the set used for [[Deanna Troi]]'s office, the dining hall was a redress of the [[USS Enterprise-D]]'s Observation lounge, and the Federation president's office was a redesign of the Ten-Forward lounge, the exterior doors to which accidentally retained their ''Enterprise''-D markings. Alien costumes in the Rura Penthe prison were reused from ''The Next Generation''{{'}}s premiere episode, \"[[Encounter at Farpoint]]\".<ref name=\"okuda\"/> The ''Excelsior'' bridge was a redress of ''Enterprise''{{'}}s command center, with consoles taken from the [[USS Enterprise (NCC-1701-D)#Command|battle bridge]] of the ''Enterprise''-D to convey the impression that the ''Excelsior'' was a more advanced ship.<ref name=\"okuda\"/>\n\nMeyer had never been happy with the brightly lit corridors and feel of the ''Enterprise'', a dissatisfaction that extended to his work on ''The Wrath of Khan''.<ref name=\"Martin_1992-02\"/>{{rp|45}} For ''The Undiscovered Country'', Meyer wanted the ''Enterprise'' interiors to feel grittier and more realistic; the metal was worn around the edges to look used without looking beat up.<ref name=\"special features-stories\"/> Narita's plans to transform the look of the ''Enterprise'' on a scale not seen since ''The Wrath of Khan'' were complicated by the necessary use of existing sets.<ref name=\"Magid_1992-02\"/>{{rp|44}}\n\nThe corridors were reduced in width and included angled bulkhead dividers, with exposed conduits added to the ceiling to convey a claustrophobic feel reminiscent of the submarine film ''[[The Hunt for Red October (film)|The Hunt for Red October]]''.<ref name=\"Dillard_1994\"/>{{rp|93}}> Narita changed the bright, smooth look of the ''Enterprise'' bridge that had been created by Zimmerman for ''The Final Frontier'' by lighting the set as spottily as possible. \"I didn't want to use too much smoke on the ''Enterprise'', because I didn't want it to end up looking too much like the Klingon starship. For that reason I decided to keep the look of the ''Enterprise'' pretty clean, but with a little more contrasty lighting,\" Narita said.<ref name=\"Magid_1992-02\"/>{{rp|44}} Meyer acknowledged that had he been the creator of the franchise, \"I would have probably designed a much more claustrophobic world because it's much more dramatic.\"<ref name=\"Dillard_1994\"/>{{rp|99}}\n\nThe director was insistent that [[LCARS|panel labels]] contain descriptive instructions that might be found on a starship, rather than made-up gibberish, [[greeking]], or gag text. Designer [[Michael Okuda]] had finished a schematic of the ''Enterprise''{{'}}s decks when Nimoy pointed out he had misspelled \"reclamation\"; while Okuda was fairly certain no one else would notice the single spelling error on the print, he had to fix it.<ref name=\"special features-stories\"/> Meyer also made a contentious decision to feature a kitchen in the film, a move that attracted fan controversy. Although the original series mentioned a [[galley (kitchen)|galley]] in the episode \"[[Charlie X]]\", only machines able to synthesize food had been shown before.<ref name=\"Reeves-Stevens_1995\"/>\n\n===Props and models===\nParamount made a decision early on to use existing ship models for filming, meaning the old models\u2014some more than a decade old\u2014had to be refurbished, adapted, and reused. As some ships had not been examined for some time, electrical problems had developed.<ref name=\"Martin_1992-02\"/>{{rp|42}} The Klingon cruiser first seen in 1979's ''The Motion Picture'' was altered to suggest an important flagship, with a flared design applied to the underside of the vessel.<ref name=\"okuda\"/> Effects supervisor William George wanted to make it distinct from the earlier ships, since it was one of the few models that could be altered: \"We did some research into military costuming, and came up with the concept that when these ships return victorious from battle, the Klingons build some sort of epaulet onto their wings or paint a new stripe on.\" The model was repainted brown and red and etched with brass.<ref name=\"Magid_1992-02\"/>{{rp|59}}\n\nDespite representing a new vessel, the ''Enterprise''-A was the same model that had been used since 1979. Poorly regarded by earlier effects artists because of its complicated wiring and bulk,<ref>{{cite journal|author=Anderson, Kay|year=1982|title='Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan': How the TV series became a hit movie, at last|journal=[[Cinefantastique]]|volume=12|issue=5\u20136|page=54}}</ref> the ''Enterprise''{{'}}s hairline cracks were puttied and sanded down, and the internal circuitry was redone. The new model's running lights were matched to similar intensities, saving the effects artists time because the lights would look correct with only a single pass, instead of three passes required previously (for the sensor dome, running lights, and window lights). One unfortunate byproduct of the fixes was the loss of the model's distinctive pearlescent finish. The elaborate sheen was never visible on screen (lighting schemes prevented reflections while filming so the ship could be properly inserted into effects shots) and so when the model was repainted with conventional techniques the effect was lost.<ref name=\"Martin_1992-02\"/>{{rp|42}} The Bird of Prey had been damaged from work in ''The Voyage Home'', where the ship was supposed to fly around the sun. To suggest singes, the model had been painted with black-tinged rubber cement, with the expectation that this application would rub off. The cement instead sat on the model and baked itself to the model surface, and had to be scrubbed off.<ref name=\"Martin_1992-02\"/>{{rp|50}}\n\n[[Greg Jein]], best known as the builder of the alien mothership from ''[[Close Encounters of the Third Kind]]'', was called on to build props for the film. Jein was a longtime ''Star Trek'' fan who had constructed the props for ''The Final Frontier'', but was forced to remake props that had since mysteriously disappeared. Jein added references to the original television series and other science fiction franchises throughout the prop designs; the Rura Penthe warden's staff contained parts of a spaceship from ''[[Buck Rogers]]'', while the frong was detailed with a prop from ''[[Buckaroo Banzai]]''. Elements from ''The Final Frontier'' were modified and reused; a medical implement from the film became Chekov's blood tester, and the assault phasers first seen in ''The Final Frontier'' became standard issue.<ref name=\"Magid_1992-02\"/>{{rp|72\u20133}} Gorkon's staff was intended to be a massive bone from an alien creature he had killed, with the designs shaped out of green foam and approved by Meyer. Two copies were strong enough to support David Warner's weight; another two were designed to be light enough to be hung from wires for the [[Weightlessness|zero gravity]] scenes. Since the Klingon phasers were redesigned for the third film, the original holsters no longer fit the weaponry; as a result, no Klingons had ever been seen drawing a phaser. Meyer was adamant about having the actors be able to unholster their weapons, so the existing pistols had to be redesigned. The Klingon sniper rifle was broken into sections, with parts modeled from real weapons.<ref name=\"Magid_1992-02\"/>{{rp|74\u20135}}\n\n===Makeup===\nThe Klingons received the first major revision in design since their appearance in ''The Motion Picture''. Dodie Shepard designed new red and black uniforms for Chancellor Gorkon and his staff, as it was judged that it would be unseemly for the chancellor to wear common warrior garb. Another concern was that there was not enough of designer Robert Fletcher's ''The Motion Picture'' uniforms for all the Klingons in the film.<ref name=\"okuda\" /> While the important Klingons were given multi-layered prosthetics and unique head ridges, background characters wore ready-made masks, with minor touch-ups on the eyes and mouth.<ref>Special Features, \"Klingons: Conjuring the Legend.\"</ref> Since it was important for the actors' expressions to be visible through the makeup, the appliances were made thin using the latest glues and paints. Transforming an actor into a Klingon took three and a half hours. Hairstylist Jan Alexander designed braids and jewelry that suggested a tribal people with a long and treasured heritage.<ref name=\"Martin_1992-02\"/>{{rp|45}}\n\n[[File:David-warner-2008.jpg|thumb|Actor [[David Warner (actor)|David Warner]] (above) was given Klingon makeup designed to subtly suggest [[Herman Melville|Melville]]'s [[Moby-Dick#Ahab|Ahab]] and President [[Abraham Lincoln]].]]\nThe main reason for the diversity of Klingon designs, hairstyles, and appliances stemmed from the fact that there were more Klingons featured than in all the previous films combined. Eighteen unique designs were used for the main characters, with another thirty \"A\" makeups, forty \"B\" foam latex makeups, and fifty polyurethane plastic masks for background extras.<ref name=\"Magid_1992-02\"/>{{rp|70}} Makeup artist [[Richard Snell (make-up artist)|Richard Snell]] was in charge of the principal Klingon actors' appliances. The designs for the foreheads came from Snell's own ideas and co-workers, but the actors were allowed input into their character's appearances. Christopher Plummer requested his character's forehead have more subdued spinal ridges than Klingons in previous films, to look unique and to humanize his character. During makeup tests, Snell was about to apply Plummer's wig when the actor muttered that he wanted no wig, with Chang's small amount of hair swept back into a warrior's topknot.<ref name=\"Martin_1992-02\"/>{{rp|49}}\n\nSnell worked through several nights to redesign the back of Chang's head and add more detail.<ref name=\"Magid_1992-02\"/>{{rp|71}} This design change meant only Plummer's front could be photographed during the first few days of filming while the makeup department created appliances to cover the back of his head.<ref name=\"Reeves-Stevens_1995\"/> Azetbur, portrayed by [[Rosanna DeSoto]], was initially conceived as barbaric, but Meyer insisted on a more refined look.<ref name=\"Martin_1992-02\"/>{{rp|49}} Like Plummer, DeSoto requested more subdued ridges, and the result was, according to artist Kenny Myers, a \"very regal woman who just happened to be Klingon\". The design changes forced Kenny Myers to abdicate his other makeup job, that of Warner's Gorkon, to Margaret Bessera. Gorkon's appearance was of special concern to Meyer, who had two specific role models: Ahab and Abraham Lincoln. \"[Meyer] loves to play the classics,\" Kenny Myers explained, \"and incorporating these two images was really genius on his part. He wanted there to be uncertainty about Gorkon's true intentions. Did he want peace, or was there something sinister in his mind? From his appearance, it was impossible to tell if he was friend or foe. Subliminally, there were aspects of both.\"<ref name=\"Martin_1992-02\"/>{{rp|50}}\n\nAlong with Klingon cosmetics, makeup supervisor [[Michael J. Mills]] was kept busy preparing the large number of other aliens called for in the script.<ref name=\"Martin_1992-02\"/>{{rp|42}} Mills and his team created the largest makeup endeavor ever seen in a ''Star Trek'' film until then; custom makeup was applied to 22 principal actors, and as many as 126 prosthetic makeups each day. Because the alien creatures played such an important role in the film, there was a concerted push to provide enough money to the makeup department to make sure the complex work was finished. According to Mills, \"[if] we could prove to [Ralph Winter] that we needed something to get the shot done, then we'd have it.\" The makeup lab employed a staff of 25 and produced over 300 prosthetics, from Klingon foreheads to Vulcan and Romulan ears. Work on the many extras began as early as one o'clock in the morning to be ready for the eight o'clock call.<ref name=\"Martin_1992-02\"/>{{rp|44\u20135}}\n\nThe large, hulking form the shapeshifter Martia assumes while on the surface of Rura Penthe was dubbed \"The Brute\" by the production team. The creature's Yeti-like appearance was based on a ''[[Smithsonian (magazine)|Smithsonian]]'' cover of a [[marmoset]]. Also created for the Rura Penthe shoot was a frozen Klingon with a horrified expression. Makeup artist [[Ed French (make-up artist)|Ed French]] found a spare Klingon headpiece in Richard Snell's possession and attached it to his own head.<ref name=\"Martin_1992-02\"/>{{rp|44}} A cast of his tortured expression was used as the foundation for the dummy used on location. The designers used striking colors and new techniques for some of the aliens; ultraviolet pigments were used to create a particularly hostile alien that fights Kirk in Rura Penthe.<ref name=\"Martin_1992-02\"/>{{rp|53\u201354}}\n\nAs it was intended to be Nimoy's last portrayal of Spock, the actor was adamant that his appearance be faithful to the original 1960s Fred Phillips and Charlie Schram design of the character. Mills consulted photos from the original television series as reference, and created five ear sculptings before Nimoy was satisfied. The result was tall ears with the tips pointing forward\u2014considerably different from Richard Snell's swept-back look for ''The Voyage Home''. The character of Valeris was designed to be more ivory-hued than Spock's yellow tone, with sleeker eyebrows and a severe haircut favored by Meyer. \"We went to great pains to establish that this is the way a Vulcan woman\u2014a sexy Vulcan woman\u2014would look,\" said Mills.<ref name=\"Martin_1992-02\"/>{{rp|45}}\n\n===Filming===\n[[Principal photography]] took place between April 16 and September 27, 1991,<ref name=ew/> using a mix of fixed sets and on-location footage. The production suffered from a lack of available set space because of shortages; the Starfleet Headquarters set was actually built a few blocks away from Paramount Pictures at the Hollywood Presbyterian Church.<ref name=\"okuda\"/> Meyer copied a technique used during filming of ''[[Citizen Kane]]'', where the filmmakers let the set fall into darkness to save money on construction.<ref name=\"meyer\"/> The film was shot in [[Super 35]] instead of [[anamorphic format]], because of the former's greater flexibility in framing and lens selection, larger depth of field, and faster lenses.<ref name=\"Altman_1992-04\"/>{{rp|47}} Because of budget cuts, plans for filming were constantly revised and reduced, but sometimes this proved to be an asset rather than a hindrance. Meyer would often say that \"art thrives on restrictions\", and Zimmerman agreed, saying that the design and filming created a rich environment that supported and enhanced the action.<ref name=\"Altman_1992-04\"/>{{rp|55}}\n\nThe dinner scene was shot in a revamped version of the ''Enterprise''-D's observation lounge. Along the wall are portraits of historical figures including Abraham Lincoln, Spock's father [[Sarek]] ([[Mark Lenard]]), and an unnamed [[Andorian]] ambassador.<ref name=\"okuda\"/> The food prepared for the scene was colored blue so it would look alien. None of the actors wanted to eat the unappetizing dishes (especially after they grew ripe under hot studio lights),<ref name=\"okuda\"/> and it became a running joke among the crew during filming to make them sample their food.<ref name=\"special features-stories\"/> Because of the multiple angles and takes required for a single mouthful of food, Meyer offered a bounty of $20 per every shot of a character eating. For Shatner, the incentive was enough that he became the only cast member to consume purple-dyed squid. The shoot lasted several days because of what Plummer called the \"horror\" of filming the dinner.<ref name=\"special features-stories\"/>\n\nThe Klingon courtroom where Kirk and McCoy are sentenced was designed like an arena, with high walls and a central platform for the accused. Originally planned for construction on the largest soundstage, cutbacks in location footage for Rura Penthe forced a smaller set to be constructed.<ref name=\"Altman_1992-04\"/>{{rp|55}} Sixty-six Klingons were used for the scene, with six actors in custom makeups and an additional fifteen in \"A-level\" makeup; the high quality designs were used for the Klingons in the first row of the stands, while those actors to the rear used masks. The illusion of endless rows of Klingons was created by brightly lighting the accused in the center of the room with a bright blue light, then letting the rest of the set fall into shadow.<ref name=\"Magid_1992-02\"/>{{rp|46}} To give the set a larger appearance, a shot from high above the courtroom was created using [[miniature effect|miniatures]]. Inspired by a scene in ''[[Ben-Hur (1959 film)|Ben-Hur]]'', matte supervisor Craig Barron used two hundred commercially available [[Worf]] dolls sent by Ralph Winter. Angry Klingons were created by rocking the dolls back and forth with motors, waving sticks lit by twelve-volt light bulbs dyed red. The resulting courtroom miniature was ten feet long.<ref name=\"Martin_1992-02\"/>{{rp|51}}\n\n[[File:Matanuska Glacier.jpg|thumb|left|Glaciers to the east of Anchorage like this one were used to provide dramatic scope to Kirk and McCoy's escape.<ref name=\"okuda\"/>]]\nFlinn conceived the penal colony Rura Penthe as on an arid, undeveloped world with odorous aliens; Meyer suggested that it be turned into an ice world instead. The exterior shots of Martia, Kirk, and McCoy traveling across the frozen wastes were filmed on top of a glacier in Alaska, forty minutes east of [[Anchorage, Alaska|Anchorage]]. Because of budget and time constraints, the [[second unit]] was tasked with getting the footage.<ref name=\"Martin_1992-02\"/>{{rp|45}} The location was accessible only by helicopter, and was scouted months before filming began. The main problem the crew faced was the cold; in the morning, the temperatures peaked at around \u221222&nbsp;\u00b0F, while by mid-afternoon it often dropped to \u221250\u00b0. The stuntmen, dressed in woolen costumes, were in danger of catching pneumonia.<ref name=\"okuda\"/> Ice caverns producer Jaffe had scouted partially melted before filming; with only two-and-a-third days of time to film, the crew had to do the best they could. Batteries drained after minutes of filming in the cold, and the lack of snow was compensated by dropping fake precipitation into the scene by helicopter.<ref name=\"Martin_1992-02\"/>{{rp|45}}\n\nScenes featuring the main characters at Rura Penthe were filmed on a soundstage. Massive fans blew dusty fake snow that, according to Shatner, got into \"every orifice\", as well as into the camera. Creating a fake blizzard was challenging; two types of plastic snow were mixed together to provide flakes and powdery accumulation. Camera magazines were changed off the stage so that there was no chance the snow could get into the film; crewmembers found the snow in their socks for weeks afterwards.<ref name=\"Magid_1992-02\"/>{{rp|47}}\n\nThe underground prison was shot in real caves left by mining at [[Griffith Park]],<ref name=\"okuda\"/> in the [[Bronson Canyon]], previously used as the [[Batcave]] and in the [[Flash Gordon (serial)|1930s ''Flash Gordon'' serial]]. Shots of the interior of the mine were captured at night so it appeared like the setting was underground. Since Narita and his crew weren't allowed to drill holes for lights in the mine shafts, illumination had to come from practical lights that appeared to be part of the set.<ref name=\"Magid_1992-02\"/>{{rp|47}} The elevator descent into the bowels of the mine was simulated by pasting fake rocks to a canvas being cranked in the background of the scene. While Zimmerman believed Shatner would hate the fight between Kirk and his doppelg\u00e4nger, the actor enjoyed the theatrical sequence, and contributed to the choreography with his knowledge of [[judo]] and [[karate]].<ref name=\"special features-stories\"/>\n\nThe battle above Khitomer was one of the last sequences to be shot, which proved fortuitous as the bridge of the ''Enterprise'' was damaged by the simulated sparks and explosions. The officer's mess set was blown up for a sequence where the ''Enterprise''{{'}}s hull is compromised by a torpedo. When the set was rebuilt for use on ''The Next Generation'', the forward wall was rebuilt and redesigned. While the Khitomer conference interior and exteriors were filmed at the [[Brandeis-Bardin Institute]] in California, the window from which Colonel West prepares to assassinate the president was a separate set built at Paramount. Footage from Brandeis, matte paintings, and the backlot were combined to create an open outdoor view.<ref name=\"okuda\" />\n\nThe division of labor for shooting the starship models was decided early on by effects cameramen Peter Daulton and Pat Sweeney. There was an equal amount of work if one crew did all the ''Enterprise'' shots and another did the Bird of Prey, Klingon cruiser and ''Excelsior'' shots, so the cameramen flipped to decide who worked on which models. Old and new techniques were applied to shooting the models. To make sure the vessels were seamlessly inserted into star fields in post-production, the crew filmed second passes in overexposed yellow light, which reduced light spillage onto the bluescreen backdrop. The yellow overcast was removed by [[Filter (optics)|filtration]] in the optical process, with the result being a clean edge around the ships.<ref name=\"Martin_1992-02\"/>{{rp|48}}\n\nUsing a technique pioneered on ''[[Back to the Future Part II]]'', another shot with a different lighting scheme was filmed. By combining separate [[key light]] and [[fill light]] passes, optical effects could generate any amount of contrast they wanted without causing spillage. Because Paramount continued to add new shots to the busy schedule and tight budget, some elements were flipped for reuse, including the star fields and a shot of the Bird of Prey firing.<ref name=\"Martin_1992-02\"/>{{rp|49}} Whenever possible, the ships were filmed from below to reinforce the nautical theme, with their movements intended to remind the audience of galleons or other large seafaring vessels.<ref name=\"Altman_1992-04\"/>{{rp|49\u201350}}\n\nThe approach to [[Earth Spacedock|Spacedock]] was filmed from below the station model, which Bill George found visually interesting and appropriate. He felt that the tracking of a shuttle from the planet evoked ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]''. The shuttle used in the scene was the only new model created for the film. It measured twelve inches and was fabricated in less than a week. The shot of the ''Enterprise'' leaving Spacedock was difficult to produce because the interior dock miniature had disappeared. Stock footage from ''The Voyage Home'' was used for one shot to compensate. Since the only other shot needed was the ''Enterprise''{{'}}s point of view leaving Spacedock through the doors, it was the only section recreated for the film.<ref name=\"Martin_1992-02\"/>{{rp|48}}\n\nThe last scene in the film was arranged for the last day of filming. Initially, the language was supposed to be more somber and classical, but Meyer made some last minute changes. Flinn said that Meyer \"was in an optimistic mood\", and the director suggested that Kirk quote ''[[Peter Pan]]'' for the last lines:<ref name=\"Altman_1992-04\"/>{{rp|52}} \"Second star to the right, and straight on till morning.\" Emotions ran high as the last shots of the cast were captured;<ref name=\"special features-stories\" /> Shatner said, \"By the time we finished the last scene, which extended longer than we expected, there was a sense of irritation. We raised a glass of champagne, but everybody was actually a little antsy.\"<ref name=\"ew\" />\n\n===Effects===\nThe majority of the [[visual effects]] were created by [[Industrial Light & Magic]] (ILM) under the supervision of Scott Farrar (who previously served as visual effects cameraman on the first three ''Star Trek'' films) and animator [[Wes Takahashi]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.agni-animation.com/fullerton/halloffame/Wes_Ford_Takahashi.html|title=Subject: Wes Ford Takahashi|publisher=Animators' Hall of Fame|access-date=June 14, 2016|archive-date=August 12, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160812020742/http://www.agni-animation.com/fullerton/halloffame/Wes_Ford_Takahashi.html|url-status=live}}</ref> After receiving the script, ILM created storyboards for the effects sequences before meeting Meyer and producers Winter and Steven-Charles Jaffe to discuss the planned scenes. These discussions began before the film was greenlit. ILM's initial cost estimates were over Paramount's budget, so to save money the filmmakers redesigned some shots and outsourced some to other companies. Elements of the zero gravity scenes were handled by [[Pacific Data Images]], while phaser beams and transporter effects were generated by Visual Concept Engineering, an offshoot of ILM that had contributed to ''The Wrath of Khan'' and ''The Final Frontier''. Despite the overall count of effects shots being dropped from over 100 to 51, the project was still large, and required virtually the entire ILM staff to complete.<ref name=\"Magid_1992-02\"/>{{rp|58}} Farrar's goal was to economize the remaining effects; if three shots were similar, they would try to tell the story with only one. Cheap [[Traditional animation#Animatic|animatics]] provided Meyer with placeholders to cut into the film and avoid costly surprises.<ref name=\"Martin_1992-02\"/>{{rp|41}} Stock footage from previous films was used whenever possible, but it was often unfeasible to do so; as the original USS ''Enterprise'' had been destroyed in ''[[Star Trek III: The Search for Spock|The Search for Spock]]'', all shots of the USS ''Enterprise''-A had to feature the updated ship registry.<ref name=\"Martin_1992-02\"/>{{rp|42}}\n\nILM's [[computer generated imagery|computer graphics]] division was responsible for creating three sequences, including the explosion of Praxis.<ref name=\"Martin_1992-02\"/>{{rp|46}} Meyer's idea for the effect was influenced by ''[[The Poseidon Adventure (1972 film)|The Poseidon Adventure]]''; Farrar used imagery of an immense wave hitting the ''Poseidon'' to inform the scale of their shock wave.<ref name=\"Altman_1992-04\"/>{{rp|49}} The department built on a [[lens flare]] simulation to create a plasma burst composed of two expanding disc shapes with swirling detail [[texture mapping|texture mapped]] to the surface.<ref name=\"Martin_1992-02\"/>{{rp|46}}\n\nFarrar settled on the preliminary look of the wave, and graphics supervisor Jay Riddle used [[Adobe Photoshop]] on a [[Macintosh]] to establish the final color scheme. Initially the team thought they would be able to use the same methods to create the wave that hits the ''Excelsior'', but found that it did not convey the scale of the wave\u2014in Riddle's words, \"this thing had to look really enormous.\" The shot was created by manipulating two curved pieces of computer geometry, expanding them as they approached the camera's view. Textures that changed every frame were added to the main wave body and over the top of it to give the impression of great speed.<ref name=\"Martin_1992-02\"/>{{rp|46}} Motion control footage of the ''Excelsior'' was then scanned into the computer system and made to interact with the digital wave.<ref name=\"Martin_1992-02\"/>{{rp|42}} ILM's ring-shaped \"Praxis Effect\" shockwave became a common feature in science fiction films depicting the destruction of large objects, while astronomer [[Philip Plait]] assumed that in reality a spherical wave would be more likely.<ref>{{cite book |title=Bad Astronomy: misconceptions and misuses revealed, from astrology to the moon landing 'hoax' |last=Plait |first=Philip |author-link=Philip Plait |year=2002 |publisher=Wiley |location=New York |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eInnwg77gbkC |format=Google Books |isbn=0-471-40976-6 |oclc=48885221 |page=254 |access-date=March 22, 2021 |archive-date=August 18, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210818112007/https://books.google.com/books?id=eInnwg77gbkC |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Jullier |first1=Laurent |last2=Welker |first2=C\u00e9cile |date=2017 |title=Les Images de Synth\u00e9se au Cin\u00e9ma |trans-title=Synthetic images in cinema |series=Focus Cin\u00e9ma |language=French |publisher=[[Armand Colin]] |chapter=Vers la maturit\u00e9 photorealiste |isbn=978-2-200-61938-1}}</ref>\n\nMeyer came upon the idea of having assassins in special boots kill a weightless Gorkon after searching for a novel way to \"blow away\" the character in space that had not been seen before.<ref name=\"special features-stories\"/> The final sequence married physical effects and stuntwork with computer graphics. Responsibility for shooting the live action footage fell to the second unit under Jaffe's direction. While the sequence read well on paper, there was not enough time or money to do the effects \"the right way\"\u2014for example, shooting the actors on a bluescreen and then inserting them into the Klingon corridors. Jaffe noted that the low-tech method of suspending actors by wires helped the final effect, because as photographed by John Fante, few wires had to be removed digitally in post-production;<ref name=\"Martin_1992-02\"/>{{rp|50}} sets were constructed so that the harsh lighting obscured wires, and entire sets were constructed on their sides so that by pulling actors up and down on the rotated sets, the characters appeared to float sideways. These sets were on [[gimbal]]s so that the movement of the actors and sets created a floating effect. The shot of two Klingons killed and thrown back down a corridor by phaser blasts was simulated by positioning the camera at the bottom of a corridor set. The set was placed on its end in the tallest soundstage at Paramount, so that the camera looked up towards the ceiling. In this position, the wires were hidden by the actors as they ascended the corridor.<ref name=\"special features-stories\"/>\n\n[[File:St6-klingon blood.png|thumb|A \"weightless\" Klingon is thrown back into a bulkhead, [[blood squirt|spurting violet blood]]. In reality, the sets were rotated 90 degrees to give the illusion of the actor floating horizontally; the digitally animated blood globules were added in post-production.]]\nThe blood that spurts out of the Klingon's wounds was created using computer generated imagery; the animators had to make sure that the blood floated in a convincing manner while still looking interesting and not too gory.<ref name=\"Altman_1992-04\"/>{{rp|49}} The effects artist looked at [[NASA]] footage of floating globules of water to inform the physics of the blood particles. Initially, the blood was to be colored green, but the filmmakers realized that McCoy had referred to Spock as green-blooded. The final color was violet, a color Meyer disliked but had to go ahead with, because his first choice\u2014red\u2014would almost certainly earn the film an R rating from the [[MPAA]].<ref name=\"meyer\"/> The initial killing of the Klingon in the transporter room as the assassins beam aboard was the testing ground for tweaking the color of the blood and how it would move around the room. Most of the blood droplets were \"blobbies\", groups of spheres smoothed together by computer, creating a continuous shape. The further apart the spheres, the more the shape could stretch and even break apart. The phasers used in the scene and throughout the film were redesigned versions of earlier models and were first used in ''The Final Frontier''. The props featured blue lights that turned on when the trigger was pressed, so effects artists knew when to add the phaser beam effects.<ref name=\"Martin_1992-02\"/>{{rp|50}}\n\nFor the zero gravity sequences, the ILM team matched Visual Concepts Engineering's phaser blasts by hand-painting the effect in Photoshop. ILM did minor touchup to the scenes as required, adding clothing tears where the phaser blasts hit the actors and adding the hazy Klingon atmosphere to the computer-rendered objects.<ref name=\"Martin_1992-02\"/>{{rp|50\u20131}} These zero gravity scenes were the most expensive sequences to complete.<ref name=\"okuda\"/>\n\nRura Penthe was created with a mixture of on-set and location shots, along with an establishing sequence created by [[Matte World Digital|Matte World]]. The characters were shot on a San Francisco beach, with a white plastic underfoot. Sun elements were layered onto the shot along with a double-exposed snow effect. Additional passes were made on fiberfill clouds with lights behind them to create a lightning storm underway in the background.<ref name=\"Martin_1992-02\"/>{{rp|53}}\n\nMartia was not the first shapeshifter on ''Star Trek'', but the character was the first to be created using computer-generated digital [[morphing]] technology.<ref name=\"okuda\"/> The effects, dubbed \"morfs\", were more advanced revisions of the technology used for films such as ''[[Terminator 2: Judgment Day]]''. Animator John Berton attempted new, more complicated morfs, including moving the camera and morphing two characters talking; special care had to be taken to line up the characters properly in plate photography. Martia becomes Kirk while talking, requiring similar line deliveries from Iman and Shatner; Farrar supervised the set photography for the morfs and had the actors speak their lines in sync via a loudspeaker.<ref name=\"Altman_1992-04\"/>{{rp|49}}\n\nKirk's fight scene with Martia in the form of Kirk was mostly filmed with a double dressed in similar clothes; in the majority of the shots the camera allowed only one of the combatants' faces to be seen. When Kirk talked with his double directly, two separate takes of Shatner facing opposite directions were combined, with the camera motion carefully controlled so that the resulting image looked realistic.<ref name=\"okuda\"/>\n\nFor the final space battle, Bill George redesigned the photon torpedoes to have a hotter core and larger flare, because he felt that the weapons in earlier films looked \"too pretty\".<ref name=\"Martin_1992-02\"/>{{rp|57}} The torpedoes moved like guided missiles rather than cannonballs. George told Farrar that he had always wanted to see something penetrate the thin saucer section of the ''Enterprise'', so a replica of the saucer was recreated and blown up; the model was hung upside down so that the explosion could be flipped to approximate the zero gravity effects. Rather than destroy the Bird of Prey model in the climax, pyrotechnic footage was reduced and placed in the appropriate locations to simulate rippling explosions throughout the vessel. A special \"pyro model\" was created from a rubber cast of the Bird of Prey and exploded instead, with a lap dissolve making the transition from the motion control ship to the pyro vessel. ILM knew that there was already footage of Chang reacting to the torpedo hit, but knew Meyer was unhappy with the result. Using footage of Plummer as reference, the effects team created a dummy that was detonated in the same position. Steve Jaffe said, \"[Editor] Ron Roose and I pored through the footage to find what amounted to three usable frames that we could use to tell the audience 'we got him!{{' \"}}<ref name=\"Martin_1992-02\"/>{{rp|57\u20138}}\n\n===Music===\nMeyer's original plan for the score was to adapt [[Gustav Holst]]'s orchestral suite ''[[The Planets]]''. The plan proving unfeasibly expensive, and with both [[James Horner]] (composer for ''The Wrath of Khan'' and ''The Search for Spock'') and [[Jerry Goldsmith]] (composer for ''The Motion Picture'' and ''The Final Frontier'') turning the film down, Meyer began listening to demo tapes submitted by composers.<ref name=\"linernotes-meyer1\">{{cite AV media notes |title=Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country Original Motion Picture Soundtrack |year=1991 |chapter=Director's notes |first=Nicholas |last= Meyer|author-link= Nicholas Meyer|pages= 2\u20133|publisher=Famous Music Corporation }}</ref> Meyer described most of the demos as generic \"movie music\", but was intrigued by one tape by a young composer named [[Cliff Eidelman]]. Eidelman, then 26, had made a career composing for ballets, television, and film, but despite work on fourteen features, no film had been the hit needed to propel Eidelman to greater fame.<ref name=\"Schweiger_1991\"/>{{rp|8}}\n\nIn conversations with Eidelman, Meyer mentioned that since the marches that accompanied the main titles for the previous ''Star Trek'' films were so good, he had no desire to compete with them by composing a bombastic opening. He felt that since the film was darker than its predecessors, it demanded something different musically as a result. He mentioned the opening to [[Igor Stravinsky]]'s ''[[The Firebird]]'' as similar to the foreboding sound he wanted. Two days later Eidelman produced a tape of his idea for the main theme, played on a synthesizer. Meyer was impressed by the speed of the work and the close fit to his vision.<ref name=\"linernotes-meyer1\"/> Meyer approached producer Steven Charles-Jaffe with Eidelman's CD, which reminded Jaffe of [[Bernard Herrmann]]; Eidelman was subsequently given the task of composing the score.<ref name=\"special features-stories\"/>\n\nEidelman began the project by creating a compilation of music from the past five ''Star Trek'' films, and he consciously avoided taking inspiration from those scores. \"[The compilation] showed me what to stay away from, because I couldn't do James Horner as well as James Horner,\" he said. Since he was hired early on in production, Eidelman had an unusually long time to develop his ideas, and he was able to visit the sets during filming. While the film was in early production Eidelman worked on electronic drafts of the final score, to placate executives who were unsure about using a relatively unknown composer.<ref name=\"Schweiger_1991\"/>{{rp|9}}\n\nEidelman stated that he finds science fiction the most interesting and exciting genre to compose for, and that Meyer told him to treat the film as a fresh start, rather than drawing on old ''Star Trek'' themes.<ref name=\"special features-stories\"/> Eidelman wanted the music to aid the visuals; for Rura Penthe, he strove to create an atmosphere that reflected the alien and dangerous setting, introducing exotic instruments for color. Besides using percussion from around the world, Eidelman treated the choir as percussion, with the [[Klingon language]] translation for \"[[to be, or not to be]]\" (\"''taH pagh, taHbe''\") being repeated in the background. Spock's theme was designed to be an ethereal counterpart to the motif for Kirk and the ''Enterprise'', aimed at capturing \"the emotional gleam in the captain's eye\".<ref name=\"Schweiger_1991\"/>{{rp|10}} Kirk's internal dilemma about what the future holds was echoed in the main theme: \"It's Kirk taking control one last time and as he looks out into the stars he has the spark again [...] But there's an unresolved note, because it's very important that he doesn't trust the Klingons. He doesn't want to go on this trip even though the spark is there that overtook him.\"<ref name=\"Altman_1992-04\"/>{{rp|46}} For the climactic battle, Eidelman starts the music quietly, building the intensity as the battle progresses.<ref name=\"special features-stories\" />\n\nThe soundtrack was released on December 10, 1991, through [[MCA Records]] and features thirteen tracks of score with a running time of forty-five minutes. In 2005, a bootleg copy of the soundtrack surfaced with thirty-six tracks of score and a running time of nearly seventy minutes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.filmtracks.com/titles/star_trek6.html|title=Filmtracks: Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country (Cliff Eidelman)|work=filmtracks.com|access-date=January 30, 2011|archive-date=November 22, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101122164002/http://filmtracks.com/titles/star_trek6.html|url-status=live}}</ref> [[Intrada Records]] released a two-disc set in 2012.

During Kirk's trial, Chang mocks Kirk with lines from ''[[Richard II (play)|Richard II]]''. The final battle above Khitomer contains seven references to five of Shakespeare's plays.<ref name=\"Kreitzer_1996\"/>{{rp|7}} Two references are drawn from the title character's lines in ''[[Henry V (play)|Henry V]]'' (\"Once more unto the breach\"/\"The game's afoot\"), while two more quotations are from ''[[Julius Caesar (play)|Julius Caesar]]'' (\"I am as constant as the [[North Star|Northern Star]]\"/\"Cry 'havoc!' and let slip the dogs of war\"). There is a single reference to Prospero from ''The Tempest'' (\"Our revels now are ended\"), and Chang shortens the wronged [[Shylock]]'s speech from ''[[The Merchant of Venice]]'': \"Tickle us, do we not laugh; prick us, do we not bleed; and wrong us, shall we not revenge?\" The final line spoken by Chang before he is obliterated by torpedo fire is lifted from Hamlet's famous soliloquy: \"to be, or not to be...\"<ref name=\"Kreitzer_1996\"/>{{rp|8}} Flinn was initially unsure about the numerous classical quotations, but when Plummer was cast, Meyer enthusiastically added more.

The first is with Chang with other Klingon officials at a dinner with Kirk and Federation officers, where Chang declares that the Klingon Empire needs \"[[Lebensraum|breathing room]]\", to which Kirk responds by imitating Spock's earlier quoting of Hamlet, saying that Chang's reference is \"Earth, Hitler, 1938\". Later when Kirk confronts Chang's warship, Chang mocks the historic British Prime Minister [[Neville Chamberlain]] who attempted to appease Hitler; with Chang saying that there will be \"no [[peace for our time|peace in our time]]\".\n\nA major theme of the film is change, and people's response to that change. Meyer considered Valeris and Chang \"frightened people, who are frightened of change\", who cling to old ways despite the changing world. He hoped that the fictionalization of a current events story allowed for an objective look at the issues, rather than being blinded by personal bias. At the beginning of the film, Kirk operates under a similar bias, calling the Klingons \"animals\" and putting him at odds with Spock. The Vulcan sees the Gorkon peace initiative as logical, responding to the sudden change in the ''status quo'' in a collected manner; he even opens the peace dialog at the behest of [[Sarek|his father]]. Kirk, meanwhile, is willing to \"let them (the Klingons) die\", unwilling to listen to Spock's words because of his biased understanding.<ref name=\"Iaccino_1998\">{{cite book|author=Iaccino, James|year=1998|title=Jungian Reflections Within the Cinema: A Psychological Analysis of Sci-Fi and Fantasy Archetypes|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=0-275-95048-4|page=29}}</ref> Kirk undergoes a transformation through the film by way of his incarceration; realizing that his hatred is outmoded he allows for a cleansing that restores his son to him in some way.<ref name=\"special features-peril\" />\n\nWhile ''Star Trek'' in general features few overt references to religion, there is a clear recognition that a laying aside of past hurts is necessary for peace, similar to the concept of ''[[shalom]]'' in Judaism.<ref>{{cite book|year=1999|title=Star Trek and Sacred Ground: Explorations of Star Trek, Religion, and American Culture|publisher=SUNY Press|isbn=0-7914-4334-5|editor1-first=Jennifer |editor1-last=Porter |editor2-first=Darcee |editor2-last=McLaren|page=183}}</ref> Shatner regretted that Kirk's angst at being outmoded was minimized in the final print.
