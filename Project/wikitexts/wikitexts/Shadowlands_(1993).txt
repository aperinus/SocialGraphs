S. Lewis]] (played by [[Anthony Hopkins]]) and Jewish American poet [[Joy Davidman]] (played by [[Debra Winger]]), her death from cancer, and how this challenged his Christianity. It was directed by [[Richard Attenborough]] with a screenplay by [[William Nicholson (writer)|William Nicholson]] based on his [[Shadowlands (1985 film)|1985 television film]] and 1989 [[Shadowlands (play)|stage play of the same name]]. The 1985 script began life as ''I Call It Joy'' written for [[Thames Television]] by [[Brian Sibley]] and Norman Stone. Sibley later wrote the book, ''Shadowlands: The True Story of C. S. Lewis and Joy Davidman''. The film won the 1993 [[BAFTA Award for Outstanding British Film]]. The film marked the last film appearance of English actor [[Michael Denison]].\n\n==Plot==\nIn the 1950s, the reserved, middle-aged [[bachelor]] [[C. S. Lewis]] is an [[Oxford University]] academic at [[Magdalen College, Oxford|Magdalen College]] and author of ''[[The Chronicles of Narnia]]'' series of children's books. He meets the married American poet [[Joy Davidman|Joy Davidman Gresham]] and her young son [[Douglas Gresham|Douglas]] on their visit to England, not yet knowing the circumstances of Gresham's troubled marriage.\n\nWhat begins as a formal meeting of two very different minds slowly develops into a feeling of connection and love. Lewis finds his quiet life with his brother [[Warren Lewis|Warnie]] disrupted by the outspoken Gresham, whose uninhibited behaviour sharply contrasts with the rigid sensibilities of the male-dominated university. Each provides the other with new ways of viewing the world.\n\nInitially, their marriage is one of convenience, a platonic union designed to allow Gresham to remain in England. But when she is diagnosed with cancer, deeper feelings surface, and Lewis' beliefs are tested as his wife tries to prepare him for her death.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Anthony Hopkins]] as [[C.

The site's critics consensus reads, \"Thanks to brilliant performances from Debra Winger and especially Anthony Hopkins, ''Shadowlands'' is a deeply moving portrait of British scholar C.S. Lewis's romance with American poet Joy Gresham.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/shadowlands |title=Shadowlands (1993) |website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |publisher=[[Fandango Media|Fandango]] |access-date=3 December 2019}}</ref>\n\n[[Roger Ebert]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' called the film \"intelligent, moving and beautifully acted.\"<ref>{{cite news |first = Roger |last = Ebert |date = January 7, 1994 |url = http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19940107/REVIEWS/401070302/1023 |title = ''Shadowlands'' |work = [[Chicago Sun-Times]] }}</ref>\n\nRita Kempley of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' described it as \"a high-class tear-jerker\" and a \"literate hankie sopper\" and added, \"William Nicholson's screenplay brims with substance and wit, though it's essentially a soap opera with a [[Rhodes scholarship]] . . .

Attenborough opts for modest, unobtrusive direction that serves the material and actors ... Hopkins adds another laurel to his recent achievements. As always, there's music in his speech and nothing is over-deliberate or forced about his acting ... Coming off years of desultory and unimpressive movies, Winger at last plays a role worthy of her talent.\"<ref>{{cite news |last = Weissberg |first = Jay |date = 2 December 1993 |url =
