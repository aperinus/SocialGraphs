The other priest is shocked until \u00c1ngel whispers his reasoning. When the other priest agrees to help him, a large cross falls and crushes him.\n\n\u00c1ngel goes into downtown Madrid, committing various sins and crimes such as taking money from a homeless man, pushing a street performer over, and telling a dying man to go to Hell and stealing his wallet. He goes to a record store and meets Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda, a self-described Satanist and [[Heavy metal subculture|heavy metal fan]] from the popular neighborhood of [[Carabanchel]], who gives him a tape of the most \"evil\" band he can think of. Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda puts \u00c1ngel up in his mother's boarding house where he lives with his mother, grandfather, and Mina, a woman he is attracted to that helps his mother with the business. \u00c1ngel then attempts to steal a book from a book store written by occult TV show host Professor Cavan, who he believes can tell him how to [[Deal with the Devil|sell his soul]] to Satan. He tries to explain to the store manager his theory: a secret code in the Bible says that the [[Antichrist]] will be born at midnight on [[Christmas Eve]], and he intends to sell his soul before the night is out to get into the birth ceremony and kill the Antichrist. The store manager does not believe him and he flees.\n[[File:Madrid (35020011746).jpg|thumb|The neon [[Schweppes]] sign where Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda hangs from is on the [[Edificio Carri\u00f3n]].<ref name=\"Madrid\">{{cite web |title=El Madrid de \u00c1lex de la Iglesia |url=https://www.esmadrid.com/sites/default/files/folleto_el_madrid_de_alex_de_la_iglesia.pdf |publisher=Ciudad de Madrid Film Office |access-date=24 April 2022 |language=es-ES }}</ref>|alt=The corner of a building with neon signs advertising Capitol, Vodafone and Schweppes.]]\n\u00c1ngel and Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda team up to kidnap and tie up Cavan, who they intimidate into telling them how to complete a ritual in which \u00c1ngel can sell his soul to the Devil. The ritual requires the blood of a [[Virginity|virgin]], so \u00c1ngel first tries to get it from Cavan's girlfriend Susana, but after knocking her out by mistake, Cavan admits that she is not a virgin. \u00c1ngel then goes back to the boarding house, drugs Mina, and draws some of her blood, but Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda's mother sees him and tries to kill him with a shotgun. \u00c1ngel escapes with some of the blood, but accidentally kills Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda's mother in the process. \u00c1ngel, Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda, and Cavan are able to burn a piece of paper, take LSD, and complete the ritual, which Cavan believes \u2014 like most of his \"occult\" practices\" \u2014 is made up. However, a [[Baphomet|he-goat]] appears in the room and stands on its hind legs in front of \u00c1ngel, then disappears. \u00c1ngel then finds a message in the burnt scraps of paper in which the devil taunts him, not fooled by \u00c1ngel's actions. \u00c1ngel, Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda, and Cavan flee the apartment when the police arrive on suspicion of Cavan's kidnapping.\n[[File:Calle Preciados, Madrid.jpg|thumb|De la Iglesia stages a shooting in [[Calle Preciados]], a commercial street in Madrid, specially crowded during Christmas.<ref name=\"Madrid\"/>|alt=A crowded street with decorative lights.]]\n\u00c1ngel and Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda frantically drive around town looking for a sign to point \u00c1ngel in the right direction. \u00c1ngel first tries to get the information on the birth of the Antichrist out of a man giving a speech about the predictions of [[Nostradamus]], resulting in a chase in which three men dressed as the [[Three Wise Men]] are shot by police by mistake. He then tries to find the information at a heavy metal show, but is beaten up by the attendees. Cavan goes on television and asks \u00c1ngel to call him, telling him that he's realized \u00c1ngel was right and he knows where the birth of the Antichrist will be.\n[[File:Puertadeeuropa.jpg|thumb|The Gate of Europe are the inclined buildings where the final fight happens.<ref name=\"Madrid\"/>|alt=A stone monument stands in the center.

The three men engage in a fight with an extreme-right gang that has holed up there and has been seen throughout the film murdering homeless people and spray painting {{lang|es|Limpia Madrid}} ({{translation|clean up Madrid}}) everywhere. Their leader is revealed as the devil when he throws Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda off the building to his death. The gang beats Cavan badly, but \u00c1ngel gets hold of a gun and kills the gang, which was also killing a baby who is the Antichrist. He then shoots the devil as well.\n\nSome time later, another actor takes over Cavan's show, and \u00c1ngel and Cavan become homeless drifters; while Cavan constantly complains that they will never be able to tell anyone how they saved the world, \u00c1ngel simply misses Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda, but has accepted the events as the duo's fate.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[\u00c1lex Angulo]] as Father \u00c1ngel Berriart\u00faa\n* {{ill|Armando De Razza|it}} as Professor Cavan\n* [[Santiago Segura]] as Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda\n* [[Terele P\u00e1vez]] as Rosario\n* [[Nathalie Sese\u00f1a]] as Mina\n* [[Maria Grazia Cucinotta]] as Susana\n* [[Jaime Blanch]]\n* [[Antonio Dechent]]\n* {{ill|Saturnino Garc\u00eda|es}}\n* {{ill|Ram\u00f3n Agirre Lasarte|es|lt=Ram\u00f3n Agirre}}\n* [[El Gran Wyoming]]\n* [[Jimmy Barnat\u00e1n]], as ''possessed child''\n}}\n\n== Production ==\nA Spanish-Italian 80%\u201320% co-production,{{Sfn|Buse|Triana Toribio|Willis|2007|p=182}} the film was produced by [[Andr\u00e9s Vicente G\u00f3mez]]' Iberoamericana Films Producci\u00f3n alongside Sogetel and M.G.
