It was released in [[Japan]] on July 10 at the Toei Anime Fair, where it was shown alongside ''[[Dr. Slump and Arale-chan: N-cha! From Penguin Village with Love]]'' and the first [[List of Yu Yu Hakusho films#Yu Yu Hakusho: The Movie|''Yu Yu Hakusho'' film]]. The antagonist Bojack was created by [[Takao Koyama]] and was designed by series creator [[Akira Toriyama]].<ref name=\"Movies\">{{Cite book |title=DRAGON BALL \u5927\u5168\u96c6 6: MOVIES & TV SPECIALS|language=ja|publisher=Shueisha|pages=212\u2013216|year=1995 |isbn=4-08-782756-9}}</ref> The film is the last to feature [[K\u014dhei Miyauchi]] as [[Master Roshi]], who died two years after its release.\n\n== Plot ==\n<!-- Per WP:FilmPlot, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 and 700 words -->\nA wealthy family hosts an intergalactic [[martial arts]] [[tournament]] on Earth in which fighters from across the galaxy compete including [[Gohan (Dragon Ball)|Gohan]], [[Piccolo (Dragon Ball)|Piccolo]], [[Future Trunks]], [[Tien Shinhan]], [[Yamcha]], and [[Krillin]]. All but Yamcha effortlessly advance much to the concern of [[Mr. Satan]] who recognizes them from the battle against [[Cell (Dragon Ball)|Cell]] and knows he will need to face whichever one of them wins. In the semifinals, Trunks fights Tien and defeats him and Piccolo is annoyed by the lack of challenge and forfeits against Krillin. Gohan, Trunks, and Krillin advance to the finals where they each battle an alien fighter. However, as the alien fighters are revealed, the fight promoter realizes that these are not the staged, fake aliens that he recruited for the event. Trunks is challenged by a sword welding alien warrior named Gokua, Krillin is defeated by a female alien named Zangya, Gohan confronts the mysterious alien Bujin, and another tournament contestant is killed by the alien fighter Bido. Meanwhile, having been complaining of fake stomach pain to avoid fighting, Mr. Satan gets trapped in a transportation pod and sent to the battlefield.\n\nTrunks is surprised by his alien opponent's lethality and is forced to transform into a Super Saiyan to kill him. Trunks is then struck down by an unknown foe while Gohan continues his fight with Bujin until he discovers Trunks and Krillin have been incapacitated. Bojack arrives and tells Gohan about his plans to conquer the universe. Tien and Yamcha join the fight but are quickly defeated by Bojack's minions. Gohan fights them as Bojack watches on in amusement while in the [[afterlife|Other World]], [[Goku]] and [[King Kai]] watch the battle with concern and King Kai reveals that centuries prior, the galactic warlord Bojack had been sealed inside of a [[star]] by all four Kais, but when Cell exploded on King Kai's planet, this allowed Bojack to become unbound.\n\nGohan is overwhelmed by the trio of minions and is nearly killed by Bojack until Piccolo saves him. Piccolo challenges Bojack but is quickly defeated. Trunks also challenges Bojack but is paralyzed by Bujin's energy absorption technique and nearly impaled by Bido's spear before he is saved by the surprise arrival of [[Vegeta]]. Bojack pummels Vegeta and assumes his \"full power\" form while Trunks is overwhelmed by Bojack's minions. With Vegeta, Trunks, and everyone else incapacitated, Gohan fights Bojack alone but is paralyzed by the combined energy absorption techniques of his minions. Gohan is attacked by Bojack but the sudden arrival of Mr. Satan's incoming pod distracts them. Gohan prepares to fight once again but is struck down by Bojack and his minions as Goku watches on helplessly as his son is captured in a [[bear hug]] and tortured.\n\nAgainst the rules of Other World, Goku abruptly uses his [[teleportation|instantaneous movement]] technique to transport himself to the fight and strikes Bojack before he can kill Gohan. After some advice and reassurance, Goku places his son on the ground safely and vanishes. Gohan, reinvigorated by his father's words, transforms into his Super Saiyan 2 form. Now unaffected by their attacks, Gohan effortlessly kills Bido and Bujin and Zangya is killed when Bojack blasts her toward Gohan. Bojack is impaled through the abdomen by Gohan's fist and as a last resort, he powers up a massive energy blast which Gohan counters with a ''Kamehameha'' wave. The energy beams clash and Bojack is killed. Gohan, exhausted, falls in delight as Goku praises his son from Other World. After the battle, the warriors and their friends laugh as they watch the news from the hospital that Mr. Satan is the one who defeated the alien intruders. On the roof, Vegeta and Piccolo sit, unimpressed by the cheerful tidings.\n\n== Cast ==\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Character\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Japanese\n! colspan=\"2\" |English\n|-\n! <small>Chinkel Post-Production/[[Mediawan Thematics|AB Groupe]] ({{Circa|2003}})</small><ref name=\"Big Green\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.behindthevoiceactors.com/forums/showthread.php?t=15614|title = Behind the Voice Actors}}</ref>\n! <small>[[Funimation]] (2004)</small>\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | [[Gohan]]\n| rowspan=\"2\" | [[Masako Nozawa]] || Jodi Forrest || [[Stephanie Nadolny]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | [[Goku]]\n| [[David Gasman]] || [[Sean Schemmel]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"2\" |[[Piccolo (Dragon Ball)|Piccolo]]\n| rowspan=\"2\" |[[Toshio Furukawa]]\n!<small>Big Green</small>\n| rowspan=\"2\" |[[Christopher R.
