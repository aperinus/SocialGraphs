Shot in [[Black-and-white|black and white]] to mimic old-time war movies, the film premiered at the [[2000 Cannes Film Festival]] on 12 May and clinched the [[Grand Prix (Cannes Film Festival)|Grand Prix]].<ref name=\"festival-cannes.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/5160/year/2000.html |title=Festival de Cannes: Devils on the Doorstep |access-date=2009-10-11 |work=festival-cannes.com |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120308103820/http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/5160/year/2000.html |archive-date=2012-03-08 }}</ref> The film was initially not allowed to be shown in theaters in China for a certain period but was eventually made commercially available in China since.\n\nThe story takes place in a small remote village named Gujiatai (or Rack Armor Terrace) near Shanhaiguan, [[Hebei]] at the end of the [[Second Sino-Japanese War|War of Resistance Against Japan]]. One night, a mysterious man brings two captives in sacks (Japanese soldier Teruyuki and translator Dong Hanchen) to the doorstep of a peasant's (Ma Dasan) home and threatens Ma to keep them until he returns to pick them up on New Year's Eve. Fearing both the mystery man and the Japanese, the whole village falls into a dilemma over what to do with the two prisoners.\n\nThe film is inspired by the novel\u00a0''Survival'' by You Fengwei, and was greatly modified during the process of adaptation.

In Jiang's own words, the film shows how Chinese literature and film has perpetuated an attitude of blaming the aggressor and casting the Chinese population as passive victims of aggression. Jiang hoped that the film illuminates this common human psychological trait of blaming others for disaster that goes beyond Chineseness.<ref name=interview/>\n\n==Plot==\n\nIn a small village named Rack-Armor Terrace in Hebei, at the foot of the [[Great Wall of China]], a local peasant called Ma Dasan is caught by surprise when a man bursts into his home one night and deposits two men in gunnysacks, instructing him at gunpoint to keep them captive but alive for the next few days and interrogate them. The man, identified only as \"Me\", leaves before Ma can catch a glimpse of him. One of the gunnysacks contains Kosaburo Hanaya, a belligerent Japanese sergeant; the other Dong Hanchen, an obsequious Chinese interpreter working for the [[Imperial Japanese Army|Japanese Army]]. Ma hurriedly enlists the help of his fellow villagers. Fearing both the mysterious \"Me\" and the Japanese, the village decides to follow the instructions from \"Me\" and detains the prisoners in Ma's cellar. Hanaya repeatedly attempts to provoke the peasants into killing him, but Dong, fearing for his own life, alters Hanaya's words in translation to make him appear conciliatory.\n\nThe mystery man fails to return by the eve of [[Chinese New Year]] as promised. Six months later, the villagers finally run out of patience and resolve to kill the prisoners. The task falls on Ma after a drawing of lots. Not daring to commit murder, Ma instead hides the prisoners in a watchtower along the Great Wall, where he visits them regularly to bring them food and water. However, an unsuccessful escape attempt by the prisoners reveals Ma's secret to the rest of the village. A bitter argument ensues and the village decides to hire an assassin from town to carry out the deed. Ma enlists the help of an old man known as One Stroke Liu, a former Imperial [[executioner]]. He is told that being beheaded by Liu feels like a passing breeze, and that the severed head will roll nine times on the ground, blink three times, and smile in a gesture of gratitude for such a painless death. However, Liu fails to harm either prisoner with one stroke. Claiming that it is the will of Heaven, Liu leaves with the prisoners uninjured.\n\nBy this time, however, Hanaya has lost all his defiance and is filled only with gratitude towards the villagers. He promises to reward the village with two wagons of grain should he be released. The villagers agree and return the prisoners to the Japanese Army encampment in the nearby town. However, the Japanese Army has already made Hanaya a war hero, believing that he was killed in battle. Returning alive after being a prisoner shames the Army. The commander of the encampment, Captain Inokichi Sakatsuka, gives Hanaya a merciless beating but feels honor-bound to fulfill the agreement between the latter and the village. Captain Sakatsuka and his men bring a great bounty of food and wine to the village and hold a feast there that evening, as Ma goes off to fetch his lover Yu'er from a neighboring village. During the feast, Captain Sakatsuka demands to have the man who captured Hanaya. He also accuses Ma of sneaking off to fetch resistance fighters. Not given a satisfactory answer, he orders all villagers to be killed and the village to be burned. Ma and Yu'er return on a raft only to find the entire village in flames. Meanwhile, Hanaya is about to commit [[harakiri]] before being stopped by Captain Sakatsuka and informed that [[Japan]] has recently surrendered, and the war is over.\n\nAfter the Chinese [[National Revolutionary Army]] takes back the area, Dong is publicly executed for collaborating with the enemy. Ma, bent on revenge, disguises himself as a cigarette vendor and loiters outside the Japanese encampment, now converted into a [[Prisoner-of-war camp|POW camp]]. When two Japanese soldiers come out to buy cigarettes, Ma hacks them with an axe and breaks into the camp, killing more POWs. He finds and pursues Hanaya, but is brought down by guards before he can kill the latter. Major Gao, commander of the Chinese Army contingent administering the town, condemns Ma's act as too despicable to deserve death by the hands of a Chinese soldier, and instead orders a Japanese POW to carry out the execution before a massive crowd. Captain Sakatsuka hands a [[katana]] to Hanaya, who takes careful aim before delivering the fatal strike. As Ma's head falls to the ground, it rolls nine times, blinks three times, and smiles, just as 'One Strike' Liu's victims were supposed to have done.\n\n== Genre ==\nThe film is a [[War film|war drama]] with a dark sense of humor about the Japanese invasion of China. It shows the brutality of war and how it affects the Chinese people.\n\n== Historical background ==\nThe events of ''Devils on the Doorstep'' take place in the last few years of the Second Sino-Japanese War. While the story is fiction, it is set during the events of 1944-1945 and the final moments leading up to Japan's surrender, marking the end of [[World War II]] and the Second Sino-Japanese War. The film takes a different approach in comparison to other [[Cinema of China|Chinese cinema]], which traditionally is anti-Japanese and contains the Chinese hero narrative. The opening invasion of China by the Japanese and the atrocity that was the\u00a0[[Nanjing Massacre]] created even stronger anti-Japanese sentiments that progressively grew stronger as the war continued on. The timeline of the film matches up accurately with history; the execution of Ma Dasan, portrayed by Jiang Wen, lines up with the announcement of the surrender of Japan on August 15, 1945, by the Japanese [[Hirohito|Emperor Hirohito]]. This makes the death of Ma all the more ironic; a great victory for the world and China is in fact the day Ma dies at the hands of the Japanese prisoners of war in a cruel twist of fate. A couple weeks later, on [[Japanese Instrument of Surrender|September 2, 1945]], the official surrender was signed and World War II was officially over.\n\nThe film's portrayal and depictions of both the Chinese and the Japanese resulted in its fair share of controversies, with many from either side unhappy with how their country was presented. Its international success saw the censorship of ''Devils on the Doorstep'' in China by the People's Republic of China officials after director Jiang Wen refused to cut and edit scenes out of the film. Despite its controversies, the film went on to win a couple of minor awards in Japan in 2003.\n\n==Director's intention==\nIn an interview,<ref>{{Cite web|title=Interview with Jiang Wen - CNN.com|url=http://www.cnn.com/2007/WORLD/asiapcf/07/31/talkasia.jiangwen/index.html?iref=newssearch|access-date=2021-06-14|website=www.cnn.com}}</ref> Jiang Wen explained the reason why he made ''Devils On The Doorstep''. The film not only reproduces the atrocities committed by the Japanese army during the time in which it was set, but also acts as a warning. In the film, the Japanese army massacres many Chinese people. Such a tragedy once happened in Jiang Wen's hometown [[Tangshan]]. By making the film, Jiang wanted both Chinese and Japanese audiences to face history.\n\nAccording to director Jiang Wen, Ma is initially very fearful but does not know the origins of his fear. The turning point comes when he sees his village in flames and his fellow villagers massacred. He then overcomes his own fear and begins longing for death. In the final scene, Ma dies a satisfying death as he has fulfilled his desire.<ref name=\"interview\" />\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Jiang Wen]] (\u59dc\u6587) as Ma Dasan, a local peasant from the village of Rack-Armor Terrace who is threatened into keeping two prisoners (Kosaburo Hanaya and Dong Hanchen) until New Year's Eve.\n* [[Kagawa Teruyuki]] (\u9999\u5ddd\u7167\u4e4b) as Kosaburo Hanaya, a hostile Japanese Army sergeant held captive by Ma Dasan.\n* Yuan Ding (\u8881\u4e01) as Dong Hanchen, a nervous Chinese interpreter working for the Japanese Army and held captive by Ma Dasan.\n* Jiang Hongbo (\u59dc\u5b8f\u6ce2) as Yu'er, a widow from Rack-Armor Terrace and lover of Ma.

''Devils on the Doorstep'' retained the central characters' relationships and story frame of ''Survival''. However, the final screenplay was largely original, with only a few similarities to You's novel. Because Jiang Wen and You Fengwei had different views about national character, this film set aside the theme of military-civilian resistance in the original work. The villagers took care of the Japanese prisoners, but the Japanese soldiers slaughtered them to death. It ruthlessly exposed the hidden character of the Chinese people's ignorance, numbness, servility and selfishness. This movie also embodies the Japanese national essence and [[Bushido]] spirit. They were merciless and cruel when they massacred the villagers, but obedient and humble after surrendering.\n\nDirector Jiang Wen and director of photography [[Gu Changwei]] chose to shoot the film in black and white to capture the details of the historical era depicted in the movie. Jiang Wen believed that the entire black and white film paved the way for the last few color shots. There were initial worries about the sales and distribution prospects for a black-and-white film, but the production eventually went ahead.\n\n=== Budget and casting ===\nAn executive director from Beijing Zhongbo Times Film Planning, one of the three investors in the film, said in an interview that the total expenditure on the film approached [[US dollar|US$]]3.9 million, way above the original budget, which he did not specify.<ref name=\"budget1\">{{in lang|zh}} Unknown.

Retrieved on 2007-03-30.</ref>\n\nThe Japanese cast members in the film, two of whom came to know Jiang while on exchange in the [[Central Academy of Drama]] in the 1980s, initially expressed concerns with the [[Japanese war crimes]] depicted in the film. Jiang spent two weeks discussing the issue with them, and showed them documentaries about the war, including some made by Japanese filmmakers. According to Jiang, the Japanese cast members eventually came to trust him. Jiang also used many non-professional actors and actresses in the film, some of whom were also members of the crew. Jiang himself also played the leading role in the film, which he admitted was a tiring experience. He said he also came to distrust what most of the crew members said about his acting, especially when they were tired and wanting to finish for the day.<ref name=\"interview\">Raynes, Tony. tr. Wang, Norman & Clark, Paul (2000-04-17), \"An interview with Jiang Wen\" (attached with DVD)</ref>\n\n=== Cinematography ===\nThough it was released in 2000, ''Devils on the Doorstep'' is filmed almost entirely in black and white \u2014 except for the last four minutes, during which Ma is executed. As his head rolls to the ground, the [[cinematography]] not only changes from black and white to color, but the camera perspective also shifts from a neutral third-person point-of-view to the first-person perspective of Ma's severed head. In an interview, director Jiang Wen explained that the reason for filming in black and white was to mimic the nature of historic photographs and make the film indistinguishable from its counterparts made before the advent of [[Color motion picture film|color cinematography]]. Monochrome cinematography also contrasts with the artificiality of the bright colors characteristic of [[Cinema of China#Rise of the Fifth Generation|Fifth Generation Chinese cinema]].\n\n''Devils on the Doorstep'' often alternates between extreme long shots and close-ups. These long shots, contrasted with extreme close-ups that fiercely frame characters' faces yet exclude the object of their gaze, or focus on details such as a pair of military boots, a sword or other mundane objects, create a fragmented vision that reflects the protagonists\u2019 confusion. This type of cinematography can be compared to the style of a detached [[Documentary film|documentary]] that intends to lead viewers to comment on the images they are seeing rather than hook viewers with strong emotions. In the early scenes of the film, [[hand-held camera]]s are used to accentuate certain comic episodes, one of which includes a scene where two Japanese soldiers chase a chicken into Ma Dasan's courtyard. The scene plays out chaotically as Ma desperately tries to keep the soldiers away from the outer room where the two prisoners are being held. A hand-held camera is also used for a more somber effect at the end of the film when the massacre of the villagers is shown. To contrast, the films\u2019 use of camera is much more subtle in the many interior shots in the early part of the film.\n\n==Release and reception==\n\n=== Cannes release and cutting ===\nThe version shown at the 2000 Cannes Film Festival was three hours long. This was a working version that was later cut to 139 minutes with director Jiang Wen's full participation in order to enhance the film's commercial prospects and to tighten the storyline, which he did not have time to do before the Cannes premier.<ref>Werner, Michael (President of Fortissimo Films), \"A note about this DVD edition\" (attached with DVD)</ref>\n\nThe film was booked for showing on 3 November 2014 at the [[Cornerhouse|Cornerhouse Manchester]] (UK) as part of Asia Triennial Manchester 14, and a 161-minute version arrived, somewhat to the organizers' surprise. The film was well received at this screening.\n\n===Temporary ban in China===\n[[Time Asia]] reported that the [[National Radio and Television Administration|Chinese Film Bureau]] was furious at Jiang for having entered the film in the Cannes Film Festival without its permission. The Film Bureau reportedly sent two officials to Cannes to try to dissuade the festival from screening ''Devils on the Doorstep'' and demanded that Jiang hand over the negative (which was brought to [[Australia]] for [[post-production]]). There were also reports from Asian film circles that the authorities planned to punish Jiang by forbidding him to work in China for seven years. A representative from the Chinese Film Bureau confirmed that Jiang's status was \"under review\" and that China suspected Jiang was awarded his prize at Cannes for \"political reasons\". The film was subsequently banned in China by the Chinese Film Bureau.\n\nIt was not known publicly if the seven-year ban was eventually imposed, but Jiang did not produce any directorial work between ''Devils on the Doorstep'' and the 2007 production [[The Sun Also Rises (2007 film)|''The Sun Also Rises'']]. However, he did act in several films, including ''[[The Missing Gun]]'' (2002), which was a huge commercial success in China. He was also nominated for Best Actor in the official [[Huabiao Awards]] in 2004 for his role in ''[[Warriors of Heaven and Earth]]'' (2003). The ban was eventually lifted and the film has been commercially available in China since.\n\nAccording to director Jiang Wen, both the Japanese producers of the film and the Chinese Film Bureau expressed similar concerns: \"Don't let Japanese soldiers kill people; Chinese people shouldn't be so dumb; Japanese soldiers shouldn't be kept as prisoners.\" A report confirmed that the authorities complained that \"Chinese civilians [in the movie] don't hate the Japanese [prisoner]\", but instead are \"as close as brothers\" with the latter. Jiang was thus accused of having belittled the Chinese whilst beautifying the Japanese.\n\n===Japanese release===\n''Devils on the Doorstep'' was commercially released in [[Japan]] on 27 April 2002, further delaying a possible lift of ban on the film in China.<ref>{{in lang|zh}} Xie, X.

The liberal leaning ''[[Asahi Shimbun]]'' said the film \"illustrates and examines the weakness of human nature\". The ''[[Mainichi Shimbun]]'' called the film Jiang's \"overarching question on human nature\". The conservative ''[[Yomiuri Shimbun]]'' also complimented Jiang, Kagawa Teruyuki and Kenya Sawada, saying their acting was \"colorful\" and \"believable\". Inevitably, however, some reviewers voiced displeasure after viewing the film, saying that it \"further estranges the Sino-Japanese friendship that was seriously damaged in the past war\".<ref>{{in lang|zh}} Yuan, Q.

The news sparked a new round of debate in China, where criticism of famous actress [[Zhao Wei]] for appearing on the cover of ''[[Harper's Bazaar|Bazaar]]'' in a dress with a [[Rising Sun Flag|Japanese military flag]] design had newly subsided.
