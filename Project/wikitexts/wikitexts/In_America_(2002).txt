The semi-autobiographical screenplay by Jim Sheridan and his daughters, Naomi and [[Kirsten Sheridan|Kirsten]], focuses on an immigrant Irish family's struggle to start a new life in New York City, as seen through the eyes of the elder daughter.\n\nThe film was an Irish, American and British co-production, and was nominated for three [[Academy Awards]]: [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay|Best Original Screenplay]] for the Sheridans, [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]] for [[Samantha Morton]] and [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Supporting Actor]] for [[Djimon Hounsou]].\n\n==Plot==\nIn 2002 Johnny and Sarah Sullivan and their daughters Christy and Ariel enter the United States on a [[Visa (document)|tourist visa]] from Ireland via Canada, where Johnny was working as an actor. The family settles in New York City, in a rundown [[Hell's Kitchen, Manhattan|Hell's Kitchen]] [[tenement]] occupied by [[Drug addiction|drug addicts]], [[Transvestism|transvestites]], and a reclusive Nigerian artist/photographer named Mateo Kuamey. Hanging over the family is the death of their five-year-old son Frankie, who died from a brain tumor discovered after a fall down the stairs. The devout [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] Johnny questions God and has lost any ability to feel true emotions, which has affected his relationship with his family. Christy believes she has been granted three wishes by her dead brother, which she only uses at times of near-dire consequences for the family as they try to survive in New York.\n\nAfter finding the apartment, Sarah gets a job in the local [[ice cream parlor]] to support the family while Johnny auditions for any role for which he is suited, with no success. Despite their poverty, the initial joy of being in the United States and the closeness of the family gives them the energy to make the most of what they have, and Christy chronicles the events of their life with a cherished [[camcorder]]. As money runs low and the city's temperatures soar, the family dip into savings to go to the movies to see ''[[E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial]]'' and enjoy the air conditioning to find respite from the oppressive weather. Tensions between Johnny and Sarah begin to rise with the summer heat. Not helping their financial and emotional strain is the discovery that Sarah is pregnant.  Eventually Johnny finds work as a [[Taxicab|cab driver]] to augment their income and help pay for the girls' Catholic school tuition.\n\nOn [[Halloween]], the girls become friendly with Mateo when they knock at his door to [[Trick-or-treating|trick-or-treat]]. Despite Johnny's reticence about the somewhat imposing and forbidding man, Sarah invites him to their apartment for dinner, and eventually they learn that the man is sad and lonely because he is dying of AIDS. \nLater, Mateo falls down a flight of stairs and is knocked unconscious. Christy tries to resuscitate him using [[Cardiopulmonary resuscitation|CPR]], although she is warned away from him by the other residents, who seem to be aware that he is [[HIV-positive]]. The man's condition continues to deteriorate as Sarah's fetus develops. The baby is [[Premature birth|born prematurely]] and in poor health, and is in need of a blood transfusion. Johnny and Sarah are ultimately nervous not only about the baby's survival chances, but also of the skyrocketing hospital bills that will now need to be paid following the baby's delivery, causing Sarah to have a brief [[nervous breakdown]] and blame Johnny for Frankie's death, and tearfully berate him.\n\nHowever, after calming her down, Johnny and Sarah agree to the blood transfusion but without giving the baby \"bad blood,\" as using hospital blood banks was the source of Mateo's contraction of HIV. Shortly, it is discovered that Christy has a compatible blood type to donate with, and Mateo's death coincides with the first healthy movements of the infant following a [[blood transfusion]] from Christy. After the successful operation, the family is startled to learn that Mateo had settled and paid for their astronomical hospital bill before he had died, upon the discovery that Mateo was in possession of a large trust fund he never spent. They give the newborn baby girl the middle name of Mateo in gratitude and to honor his memory.\n\nWith the birth of the new baby and the death of Mateo, Johnny finally is able to overcome his lack of emotion and put his grieving for Frankie to rest. He also finally catches a break by getting a small role in ''[[A Chorus Line]]'' on Broadway.  The film ends after a baby shower at the apartment is held for the Sullivan family with many of the apartment tenants present to celebrate, and Christy and the rest of her family take in the view of the city and look out for Mateo in the night's sky.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Paddy Considine]] as Johnny Sullivan\n* [[Samantha Morton]] as Sarah Sullivan\n* [[Sarah Bolger]] as Christy Sullivan\n* Emma Bolger as Ariel Sullivan\n* [[Djimon Hounsou]] as Mateo Kuamey\n* Merrina Millsapp as Marina, waitress at the \"Heaven\" ice cream parlor\n* [[Adrian Martinez (actor)|Adrian Martinez]] as Shopkeeper\n\n==Production==\nThe film is dedicated to director/screenwriter [[Jim Sheridan]]'s brother Frankie, who died at the age of ten. In ''The Making of in America'', a featurette on the DVD release of the film, Sheridan explains Christy and Ariel are based on his daughters\u2014and co-writers\u2014Naomi and Kirsten. He says they wanted to make a film showing how people can learn to overcome their pain and live for the future instead of dwelling on the sadness of the past.\n\n[[Manhattan]] locations include [[Hell's Kitchen, Manhattan|Hell's Kitchen]], [[Times Square]], the [[Lincoln Tunnel]], and [[8th Street (Manhattan)|8th Street]] in the [[East Village, Manhattan|East Village]].\n\nInteriors were filmed at the [[Ardmore Studios]] in [[County Wicklow]] in Ireland. The fairground scene was filmed on [[Parnell Street]], Dublin.\n\nThe soundtrack includes songs performed by [[The Lovin' Spoonful]], [[Culture Club]], [[The Corrs]], [[The Byrds]], [[Kid Creole and The Coconuts]], [[Evan Olson]], and [[The Langhorns]].\n\n==Release==\nThe film premiered at the 2002 [[Toronto International Film Festival]]. In 2003, it was shown at the [[Sundance Film Festival]], the Boston Irish Film Festival, the [[Tribeca Film Festival]], the [[Edinburgh Film Festival]], the Hamburg Film Festival, the Warsaw Film Festival, the Dinard Festival of British Cinema, and the [[Austin Film Festival]].\n\n===Box office===\nThe film opened in the UK on 31 October 2003, where it earned \u00a3284,259 on its opening weekend. It opened in limited release in the US on 26 November. It eventually grossed $15,539,656 in the US and $9,843,255 elsewhere, for a total worldwide box office of $25,382,911<ref name=\"mojo\">{{mojo title|inamerica|In America}}</ref>\n\n===Critical reception===\n[[Rotten Tomatoes]] gave the film a score of 89%, based on 177 reviews, and an average rating of 7.75/10. The website's critical consensus states, \"A rich and moving story about an immigrant family adjusting to life in New York\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/in_america/|title=In America|publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|access-date=8 October 2017}}</ref> [[Metacritic]] assigned the film a weighted average score of 76 out of 100, based on 41 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.metacritic.com/movie/in-america|title = In America |website=[[Metacritic]]}}</ref>\n\nIn his review in ''[[The New York Times]]'', [[A. O. Scott]] called it a \"modest, touching film\" and added, \"Many of [its] elements . . . seem to promise a sticky bath of shameless sentimentality. But instead, thanks to Jim Sheridan's graceful, scrupulously sincere direction and the dry intelligence of his cast, ''In America'' is likely to pierce the defenses of all but the most dogmatically cynical viewers . . . Mr. Sheridan is more interested in particular people than in general plights, and what lingers in the mind after you have seen his movies is the rough, radiant individuality of his characters . . . This movie, from moment to moment, feels small, almost anecdotal. It is only afterward that, like Mr. Sheridan's other films, it starts to grow into something at once unassuming and in its own way grand.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://movies2.nytimes.com/2003/11/26/movies/26AMER.html|title=Charming Illegal Aliens Facing Family Upheaval|last=Scott|first=A.

There's no questioning the director's ability to wring moving moments from potentially sentimental and decidedly familiar material: the story of penniless immigrants trying to make it in Manhattan. It got to me. I'm still trying to decide whether I was won over or worn down&nbsp;\u2014 but why not give Sheridan the benefit of the doubt? . . . [He] is clearly drawing on deep personal reserves for this picture, and despite a few sequences when the creative hand seems intrusive, does well by his subject. When you see a director going for that lump-in-the-throat mood, instinct takes over and you want to dig in your heels. Sometimes it's best just to let yourself be swept away.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2003/11/26/DDGN739TDC1.DTL|title='In America' sappy but satisfying|last=Addiego|first=Walter|work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]|publisher=[[Hearst Corporation]]|date=26 November 2003|access-date=10 May 2008}}</ref>\n\n[[Peter Travers]] of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' rated the film three out of a possible four stars, calling it \"forceful, funny and impassioned\" and \"an emotional wipeout\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/movie/5948639/review/5948640/in_america |title=In America : Review |last=Travers |first=Peter |author-link=Peter Travers |work=[[Rolling Stone]] |publisher=[[Jann Wenner|Wenner Media]] |date=25 November 2003 |access-date=10 May 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080529180428/http://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/movie/5948639/review/5948640/in_america |archive-date=29 May 2008 |url-status=dead  }}</ref>\n\nIn the ''[[St. Petersburg Times]]'', Steve Persall graded the film A and added, \"This is a tearjerker for all the right reasons. Because it's delicately manipulative and the characters are so precisely emotional. And because Sheridan's manner with the material makes crying seem like a cleansing, an affirmation that something so simple and sweet can still move us . . . I loved this unassuming, heartfelt little gem, even if I couldn't stop sobbing for an hour after the show. It's just so beautiful.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sptimes.com/2003/12/25/Weekend/_America__the_beautif.shtml|title='America' the beautiful|last=Persall|first=Steve|work=[[St. Petersburg Times]]|publisher=[[Times Publishing Company]]|date=25 December 2003|access-date=10 May 2008|url-status=dead|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20040207035539/http://www.sptimes.com/2003/12/25/Weekend/_America__the_beautif.shtml|archive-date=February 7, 2004}}</ref>\n\nClaudia Puig of ''[[USA Today]]'' called it \"touching, but not cloying, uplifting and hopeful but never sappy and also just plain funny. There is not a false note among the five core performances, nor a false word in Sheridan's script. ''In America'' is a classic story of losing and finding faith told with heart, humor and emotional heft.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/movies/reviews/2003-11-25-america-review_x.htm|title=Family picks up pieces 'In America'|last=Puig|first=Claudia|work=[[USA Today]]|publisher=[[Gannett Company]]|date=25 November 2003|access-date=10 May 2008}}</ref>\n\nIn ''[[The Observer]]'', [[Philip French]] said, \"The movie lacks conviction from implausible beginning to sentimental end.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://film.guardian.co.uk/News_Story/Critic_Review/Observer_review/0,,1075898,00.html|title=In America|last=French|first=Philip|author-link=Philip French|work=[[The Observer]]|publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]]|date=2 November 2003|access-date=10 May 2008}}</ref>\n\n==Accolades==\n;Wins\n* [[Independent Spirit Award for Best Supporting Actor]]&nbsp;\u2013 [[Djimon Hounsou]]\n* [[Independent Spirit Award for Best Cinematography]]&nbsp;\u2013 [[Declan Quinn]]\n* [[Satellite Award for Best Film \u2013 Drama]]\n* [[Satellite Award for Best Director]]&nbsp;\u2013 [[Jim Sheridan]]\n* [[Satellite Award for Best Supporting Actor \u2013 Motion Picture]]&nbsp;\u2013 Djimon Hounsou\n* [[American Film Institute Awards 2003|American Film Institute Audience Award for Best Feature Film]]\n* [[2004 Bangkok International Film Festival|Bangkok International Film Festival Golden Kinnaree Award for Best Director]]\n* [[Black Reel Awards of 2004|Black Reel Award for Best Supporting Actor \u2013 Motion Picture]]&nbsp;\u2013 Djimon Hounsou\n* [[BFCA Critics' Choice Award for Best Writer]]\n* [[National Board of Review Award for Best Original Screenplay]]\n* [[Stanley Kramer Award|Producers Guild of America Stanley Kramer Award]]\n* Phoenix Film Critics Society Award for Best Original Song&nbsp;\u2013 \"Time Enough for Tears\"\n* [[Young Artist Award]] for Best Performance in a Feature Film&nbsp;\u2013 Young Actress Age Ten or Younger&nbsp;\u2013 Emma Bolger\n* Flanders International Film Festival Grand Prix Award&nbsp;\u2013 Jim Sheridan\n* [[San Diego Film Critics Society Award for Best Supporting Actor]]&nbsp;\u2013 Djimon Hounsou\n* Phoenix Film Critics Society Award for Best Original Screenplay\n* Phoenix Film Critics Society Award for Best Performance by a Youth in a Lead or Supporting Role&nbsp;\u2013 Female&nbsp;\u2013 [[Sarah Bolger]]\n\n;Nominations\n* [[Academy Award for Best Actress]]&nbsp;\u2013 [[Samantha Morton]]\n* [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor]]&nbsp;\u2013 Djimon Hounsou\n* [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay]] \u2014 [[Jim Sheridan]], Naomi Sheridan and [[Kirsten Sheridan]]\n* [[Golden Globe Award for Best Screenplay]]\n* [[Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song]]&nbsp;\u2013 \"Time Enough for Tears\"\n* [[Independent Spirit Award for Best Film]]\n* [[Independent Spirit Award for Best Director]]\n* [[Independent Spirit Award for Best Actress]]&nbsp;\u2013 Samantha Morton\n* [[Independent Spirit Award for Best Supporting Actress]]&nbsp;\u2013 Sarah Bolger\n* [[Satellite Award for Best Actor -
