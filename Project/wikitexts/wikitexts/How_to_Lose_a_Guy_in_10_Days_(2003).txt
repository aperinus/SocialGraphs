It is based on the [[picture book]] of the same name by Michele Alexander and Jeannie Long. The book has no [[narrative]], only a list of comedic dating \"don'ts\", so the characters and plot were both created specifically for the film. In the film, advertising executive Benjamin Barry makes a bet that he can make any woman fall in love with him, while women's magazine writer Andie Anderson plans to write an article about how she led her boyfriend to dump her, putting them at cross-purposes after they choose each other as their romantic partners. Andie employs a number of the dating \"don'ts\" from the picture book in her efforts to get Ben to break up with her.\n\n==Plot==\nAndie Anderson is a writer for the women's magazine ''Composure'' as the \"How to\", subject-matter expert. She is bored and wishes she could write about more serious topics. After Andie's friend Michelle experiences yet another break-up, she becomes despondent and says she is not attractive enough. Andie argues that the problem is rather her needy, excessively emotional behavior with men, and is inspired to write an article titled \"How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days\" in order to prove her point; she will begin dating a man and drive him away within 10 days simply by imitating Michelle's behavior.\n\nAdvertising executive Benjamin Barry is looking to branch out from his usual remit of beer and sports campaigns, and lead a prestigious advertising campaign for a diamond company. At a bar, Ben's boss, Phillip, questions whether Ben has enough insight into the romance typically associated with diamonds. In response, Ben wagers he could make any woman fall in love with him. Phillip says that if he can achieve this before the ball that will take place in 10 days, he will allow Ben to lead the diamond campaign. Ben's rivals, Judy Spears and Judy Green, were at the ''Composure'' magazine offices earlier in the day and know about Andie's task. Seeing Andie at the bar, they pick her as the woman to be romanced by Ben.\n\nBen and Andie meet and soon start their quests, neither revealing their true intentions. Andie works hard to make Ben break up with her in order to complete her article, but Ben continues to stick around in hopes of making her fall in love with him. Andie makes Ben miss seeing the final shot in a Knicks game by sending him to get her a soda, gets him knocked out in a movie theater by talking aloud while watching a film, moves her things into his apartment, gets him a fern plant to represent their relationship and a [[Chinese Crested Dog]], and takes him to a [[Celine Dion]] concert when he was under the assumption he was going to see a [[New York Knicks]] basketball game. However, she also occasionally lets her normal side show, which Ben begins falling for.\n\nFed up with the project, Andie throws a fit at Ben's boys' poker night to finally drive him to break up with her. However, Ben's friends Tony and Thayer push him to stay the course by proposing couples counseling with Andie. Andie has Michelle pose as a couples therapist and suggest Ben is ashamed of Andie. Ben counters by offering to introduce her to his family in [[Staten Island]] for the weekend. While vacationing together Ben and Andie form a genuine bond. Andie and Ben go to the company ball together where Phillip meets Andie and tells Ben that he \"met her, she loves you, you win.\"\n\nTo sabotage Ben, Judy and Judy tell Tony and Thayer that Andie knew about the bet all along and was playing along to help Ben win. Tony and Thayer beg Andie to keep quiet, unwittingly making her aware of the bet. Simultaneously, Andie's boss Lana, who is unaware of Ben's role, tells him about Andie's \"How To\" article. Upon learning of Ben's bet, Andie attempts to humiliate Ben in front of everyone at the party, and the pair argue on stage before breaking up.\n\nTony shows Ben Andie's article. She explains in it how she \"lost the only guy I've ever fallen for\". When he hears she quit her job at ''Composure'' (since Lana again refused to let her write about serious topics) and is on her way to Washington, D.C. for an interview, he chases her taxi and stops her. Once he accuses her of running away, they reveal their true feelings for each other. Ben instructs the taxi driver to return Andie's belongings to her home, and then they kiss.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Kate Hudson]] as Andie Anderson\n* [[Matthew McConaughey]] as Benjamin Barry\n* [[Kathryn Hahn]] as Michelle\n* [[Annie Parisse]] as Jeannie\n* [[Adam Goldberg]] as Tony\n* [[Thomas Lennon (actor)|Thomas Lennon]] as Thayer\n* [[Michael Michele]] as Judy Spears\n* [[Shalom Harlow]] as Judy Green\n* [[Robert Klein]] as Phillip Warren\n* [[Bebe Neuwirth]] as Lana Jang\n* [[Liliane Montevecchi]] as Mrs. DeLauer\n* [[Marvin Hamlisch]] as Himself (cameo)\n\n==Production==\n[[Gwyneth Paltrow]] and director [[Mike Newell (director)|Mike Newell]] were originally attached to the project but producer Lynda Obst was unable to get Newell to commit to a date and Paltrow went on to work on the film ''[[View from the Top]]''.<ref name=\"ew-obst\">{{cite magazine | author = EW Staff | date = February 7, 2003 | title = How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days | magazine = Entertainment Weekly | url = https://ew.com/article/2003/02/07/how-lose-guy-10-days/ }}</ref>\n\nThe yellow gown Kate Hudson wore in the movie was created by [[Carolina Herrera]] along with the film\u2019s costume designer.
