S. Lewis]]'s children's epic [[fantasy]] series, ''[[The Chronicles of Narnia]]''. It was co-produced by [[Walden Media]] and [[Walt Disney Pictures]] and distributed by [[Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures|Buena Vista Pictures]]. [[William Moseley (actor)|William Moseley]], [[Anna Popplewell]], [[Skandar Keynes]] and [[Georgie Henley]] play [[Peter Pevensie|Peter]], [[Susan Pevensie|Susan]], [[Edmund Pevensie|Edmund]], and [[Lucy Pevensie|Lucy]], four British children evacuated during [[the Blitz]] to the countryside, who find a wardrobe that leads to the [[fantasy world]] of [[Narnia (world)|Narnia]], where they ally with the lion [[Aslan]] (voiced by [[Liam Neeson]]) against the forces of Jadis, the [[White Witch]] ([[Tilda Swinton]]).\n\nThe film was released on December 9, 2005, in both Europe and North America to positive reviews and was highly successful at the box office, grossing more than $745&nbsp;million worldwide, making it 2005's third-most-successful film. It won the 2005 [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Best Makeup and Hairstyling|Best Makeup]] and various other awards. An extended edition was released on December 12, 2006, and was only made available on [[DVD-Video|DVD]] until January 31, 2007, when it was discontinued.

S. Lewis's series]], and was followed by ''[[The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian|Prince Caspian]]'' in 2008 and ''[[The Chronicles of Narnia: The Voyage of the Dawn Treader|The Voyage of the Dawn Treader]]'' in 2010. The three films have grossed a total of over $1.5 billion worldwide.\n\n== Plot ==\n<!-- Please review the guidelines at WP:FILMPLOT before adding material. The plot summary should be between 400-700 words. -->\nAfter surviving an air raid during [[World War II]], the Pevensie children ([[Peter Pevensie|Peter]], [[Susan Pevensie|Susan]], [[Edmund Pevensie|Edmund]], [[Lucy Pevensie|Lucy]]) are [[Evacuations of civilians in Britain during World War II|evacuated]] from London to the country home of [[Digory Kirke|Professor Kirke]].\n\nDuring a game of [[hide-and-seek]], Lucy discovers a wardrobe and hides inside, only to find that she has entered a magical [[winter]] world. Lucy finds a [[Street light|lamppost]] and encounters a [[faun]] named [[Mr. Tumnus]], who invites her to his home and tells her that she is in [[Narnia (world)|Narnia]]. Tumnus puts Lucy to sleep by playing a flute lullaby, and when Lucy wakes up, he sadly explains that the [[White Witch]] cursed Narnia to eternally experience winter and never [[Christmas]], and any humans encountered are to be brought to her. However, Tumnus instead sends her home, where Lucy finds hardly any time had passed, and her siblings disbelieve her story due to the normal state of the wardrobe.\n\nOne night, Lucy successfully returns through the wardrobe, but Edmund follows her. Edmund meets the White Witch, who claims to be queen of Narnia. Edmund tells her about his siblings and Tumnus, and the Witch offers him [[Turkish delight]] and kingship if he brings his siblings to her castle. After she departs, Edmund and Lucy reunite. Lucy informs Peter and Susan, but Edmund lies out of spite. When Peter and Susan bring the issue to Professor Kirke, he suggests Lucy is telling the truth.\n\nWhile fleeing the housekeeper after accidentally breaking a window, the four siblings retreat to the wardrobe and enter Narnia. Peter berates Edmund for lying and forces him to apologize to Lucy. They discover that the Witch has taken Tumnus, and they meet a couple of talking [[beaver]]s, who say [[Aslan]] plans to return and regain control of Narnia, and there is a prophecy that says if two sons of Adam and two daughters of Eve sit on the thrones of Cair Paravel, the Witch's reign will end.\n\nEdmund sneaks off to visit the Witch, but she becomes furious that he came without his siblings. The Witch sends wolves to find the children, and Edmund is imprisoned, where he meets Tumnus. The children and beavers escape, and the Witch demands Edmund reveal their location. Tumnus defends Edmund, but the Witch reveals Edmund's treachery before turning Tumnus to stone.\n\nWhile Peter, Lucy, Susan, and the beavers travel, they encounter [[Father Christmas]], a sign that the Witch's power is weakening. He gives them tools to defend themselves \u2014 Lucy receives a [[cordial (medicine)|cordial]] that can heal any injury, and a dagger; Susan receives a magical [[Horn (instrument)|horn]], and a bow and quiver of arrows; and Peter receives a sword and shield. After evading [[Maugrim]]'s wolves due to the melting ice, the group finally reaches Aslan's camp, where he is revealed to be a noble [[lion]] who promises to help Edmund. Two wolves ambush Lucy and Susan, but Peter kills Maugrim, and some of Aslan's troops follow the other wolf to the Witch's camp and rescue Edmund.\n\nThe White Witch journeys to Aslan's camp to claim Edmund, but Aslan secretly offers himself instead. That night, as Lucy and Susan covertly watch, the White Witch kills Aslan, then deploys an army to slaughter Aslan's troops. Lucy and Susan send a warning, and Edmund persuades Peter to take command. In the morning, both armies violently clash, but Aslan is resurrected, citing magic beyond the Witch's understanding. Aslan takes Susan and Lucy to the Witch's castle to free the [[petrifaction|petrified]] prisoners. Edmund is mortally wounded while saving Peter from the Witch, but the reinforcements arrive and Aslan kills the Witch. Edmund is healed by Lucy's cordial, and the Pevensies are crowned King Peter the Magnificent, Queen Susan the Gentle, King Edmund the Just, and Queen Lucy the Valiant.\n\nFifteen years later, the Pevensie children, now young adults, pursue a white stag. They encounter the lamppost which Lucy first saw when she entered Narnia. After which they tumbled out of the wardrobe at roughly the same time and day they left, becoming children again. Professor Kirke finds the children, asking why they were in the wardrobe.\n\nIn a mid-credits scene, Lucy attempts to use the wardrobe, but Professor Kirke tells her he has also tried, and they will probably return to Narnia when they least expect it.\n<!-- Please review the guidelines at WP:FILMPLOT before adding material.
