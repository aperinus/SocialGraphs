Minnie Moore is a museum curator in an abusive relationship with a married man named Jim. Following their fight, she becomes disillusioned with love and meaningful relationships. Minnie talks with a friend about getting older and her chances of finding the right man.\n\nThe next day, Minnie is set up on a blind date with a bitter and loudmouthed widower, Zelmo. The date goes badly and ends with Zelmo chasing her out of the restaurant. Seymour, working the parking lot, witnesses the commotion and enters into a physical altercation with Zelmo. Seymour wins the fight, bloodying Zelmo's face, and Zelmo drives away crying, stranding Minnie. Seymour offers to give her a ride, which she refuses, but he pursues her in his truck and forces her inside. He drives her to her workplace, the [[Los Angeles County Museum of Art]]. Jim is waiting inside with his son and ends the relationship, revealing that his wife has attempted suicide. Infuriated and hurt, Minnie slaps Jim.\n\nSeymour appears at Minnie's house to confront her about costing him his job at the parking lot. He takes her to a bar for a drink and then proclaims his love for her at a hot-dog stand. He berates her for taking herself too seriously when she does not return his affections. After leaving Minnie, Seymour brings a lady to his apartment who stays overnight.\n\nSeymour takes Minnie to an ice-cream parlor and a country/western bar. In the parking lot, they dance to the music and kiss. When Minnie fails to introduce Seymour to her wealthy friends on the way into the bar, he angrily drives away and strands her, just as Zelmo had done. A wealthy male friend drives her home, where Seymour is waiting. The men fight, injuring Minnie in the process.\n\nSeymour brings Minnie inside to recover, where she admits that she does not see a future with Seymour. Insisting that they are meant for each other, he threatens to kill himself and then cuts his long moustache in a frenzy. Minnie finally agrees to marry him and tells her mother about the news. Minnie and Seymour go to dinner with their mothers, who are hesitant and dubious about the marriage. Seymour's mother calls him a \"bum\" and tells Minnie that she could do much better than her son. Minnie's mother is overwhelmed and nearly speechless at the abruptness of the news and Seymour's appearance and personality.\n\nMinnie and Seymour marry, laughing as the minister forgets his lines and fumbles for his notes. A [[flashforward]] shows a sunny backyard birthday party, possibly for their own child.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Gena Rowlands]] as Minnie Moore\n* [[Seymour Cassel]] as Seymour Moskowitz\n* [[Val Avery]] as Zelmo Swift\n* [[Timothy Carey]] as Morgan Morgan (as Tim Carey)\n* [[Katherine Cassavetes]] as Sheba Moskowitz\n* [[John Cassavetes]] as Jim (uncredited)\n* David Rowlands as Minister\n* [[Alexandra Cassavetes]] as Young girl in ballet tutu (uncredited)\n* [[Zoe R.

Several months after the film's release, [[Universal Studios]] shortened the film's running time by excising a scene near the beginning of the film, but doing so violated the studio's contract with Cassavetes.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} All releases (including the DVD) since that time are missing this scene.\n\n==Reception==\nThe film received generally positive reviews. In 1973, Cassavetes was nominated for a [[Writers Guild of America Award]] for Best Comedy Written Directly for the Screen.\n\n==In other media==\nThe characters Big John and Little John spend Halloween night smoking marijuana and watching ''Minnie and Moskowitz'' in the 2021 horror film ''[[Halloween Kills]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://chicago.suntimes.com/movies-and-tv/2021/10/13/22725199/halloween-kills-review-michael-myers-movie-anthony-michael-hall-jamie-lee-curtis-judy-greer|title = 'Halloween Kills' puts a knife in the promising reboot of Michael Myers|date = 13 October 2021}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/14/movies/halloween-kills-review.html|title='Halloween Kills' Review: There Will be (Copious Amounts of) Blood|newspaper=The New York Times|date=14 October 2021|last1=Catsoulis|first1=Jeannette}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/arts/film/reviews/article-halloween-kills-is-brutally-strange-enjoyably-ruthless/|title = Review: Halloween Kills is brutally strange, enjoyably ruthless|newspaper = The Globe and Mail|date = 14 October 2021|last1 = Hertz|first1 = Barry}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.indiewire.com/2021/09/halloween-kills-review-1234662903/|title = 'Halloween Kills' Review: Little More to Offer Than a Jacked up Body Count on a Bed of Fan Service|date = 8 September 2021}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://theplaylist.net/halloween-kills-david-gordon-green-jamie-lee-curtis-venice-review-20210908/|title='Halloween Kills' ...And Kills and Kills, but Sadly Does Not Slay &#91;Venice Review&#93;}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of American films of 1971]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{IMDb title|id=0067433|title=Minnie and Moskowitz}}\n*{{TCMDb title|id=83549|title=Minnie and Moskowitz}}\n*{{Letterboxd film|minnie-and-moskowitz}}\n\n{{John Cassavetes}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Minnie And Moskowitz}}\n[[Category:1971 films]]\n[[Category:Films set in Los Angeles]]\n[[Category:Films directed by John Cassavetes]]\n[[Category:1970s English-language films]]\n[[Category:1971 drama films]]\n[[Category:Universal Pictures films]]\n[[Category:American independent films]]\n[[Category:American drama films]]\n[[Category:1971 independent films]]\n[[Category:1970s American films]]"}]}}}}
