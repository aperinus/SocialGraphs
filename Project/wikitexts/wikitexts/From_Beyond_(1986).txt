P. Lovecraft]]. It was written by [[Dennis Paoli]], Gordon and [[Brian Yuzna]], and stars [[Jeffrey Combs]], [[Barbara Crampton]], [[Ken Foree]] and [[Ted Sorel]].\n\n''From Beyond'' centers on a pair of scientists attempting to stimulate the [[pineal gland]] with a device called the Resonator, with the unforeseen result of their perceiving creatures from another dimension. The creatures drag the head scientist into their world, returning him as a grotesque shape-shifting monster that preys upon the others at the laboratory.\n\n== Plot ==\nScientist Dr. Edward Pretorius has developed the Resonator, a machine that allows whoever is within range to see beyond normal perceptible reality. His assistant, Dr. Crawford Tillinghast, activates the machine and sees strange creatures in the air. He is bitten by one of them. He notifies Pretorious about the machine's functionality. Pretorius, driven by lust for power and knowledge, turns the machine on and becomes mad with the feelings the Resonator causes. The Resonator malfunctions at full power, causing Crawford to panic and flee. When the police arrive, they find Pretorius decapitated, yet no blood. Crawford is arrested for murder.\n\nCrawford is committed to a psychiatric ward, where he is treated by Dr. Katherine McMichaels. After Crawford gives his account of Pretorius' death, Katherine orders that Crawford undergo a CT scan, showing that Crawford's pineal gland is enlarged and growing. Convinced of Crawford's innocence, Katherine has him released to her custody, and takes him back to Pretorius' house and the Resonator. They are accompanied by Detective Bubba Brownlee, who investigated Pretorius' death.\n\nKatherine and Crawford rebuild the Resonator. Crawford reactivates the machine, which causes more creatures to appear along with a naked Dr. Pretorius. His consciousness now altered and expanded, Pretorius tells of a world beyond that is more pleasurable than normal reality, and that his death was a means of ascending to this realm. Pretorious attacks Crawford, Bubba, and Katherine with slime-covered arms. Crawford shuts off the Resonator, making Pretorius and the creatures vanish.\n\nKatherine thinks the Resonator could shed light on victims of schizophrenia and brain damage and suggests they turn it back on, but Bubba and Crawford disagree. While Bubba and Crawford are asleep, Katherine gets up and turns it back on, bringing forth the now-mutated Pretorius. Pretorius grabs Katherine, preparing to eat her mind and take her to the world of beyond. Crawford and Bubba go down into the basement to shut off the power, but encounter a giant worm-like monster, which attacks Crawford. Bubba succeeds in shutting off the power, rescuing Crawford and Katherine and sending Pretorius away.\n\nBubba decides they should leave the house. Pretorius somehow returns and the Resonator turns back on, as all three of them run up into the attic to deactivate it. Katherine and Crawford are attacked by bee-like creatures, and as Bubba pushes them out of the way, he is devoured to the bone. Crawford fights off Pretorius and frees Katherine, but then his enlarged pineal gland pops out of his forehead. Katherine short circuits the machine by spraying it repeatedly with a fire extinguisher.\n\nShe takes Crawford back to the hospital, where she is evaluated for insanity and schizophrenia, since her story was just like Crawford's. As Katherine is being prepared for shock treatment by a sadistic staff member, Crawford develops an overwhelming hunger for human brains and kills Katherine's superior Dr. Bloch. Katherine escapes and drives back to the house with a bomb. A crazed Crawford follows her.\n\nKatherine places a timed bomb on the Resonator. Crawford attacks her. As he is about to eat her brain, she bites off his pineal gland, reverting him to his senses. Dr. Pretorius' will reconnects the severed wires of the Resonator and fixes the short circuit damage. Pretorius returns and swallows Crawford whole. Before Pretorius can do the same to Katherine, Crawford's consciousness fights for control within Pretorius, the opposing consciousnesses tearing their shared body apart. Katherine escapes through the attic window just as the bomb explodes, destroying the Resonator and killing both Pretorius and Crawford.\n\nLanding outside, Katherine breaks her leg and the neighbors gather around her as she suffers a mental breakdown, saying \"It ate him!\" in between mad laughter and crying.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Jeffrey Combs]] as Dr. Crawford Tillinghast\n* [[Barbara Crampton]] as Dr. Katherine McMichaels\n* [[Ted Sorel]] as Dr. Edward Pretorius\n* [[Ken Foree]] as Bubba Brownlee\n* Carolyn Purdy-Gordon as Dr. Bloch\n* Bunny Summers as Neighbor Lady\n* Bruce McGuire as Jordan Fields\n\n== Production ==\nDirector [[Stuart Gordon]] had previously worked with actors [[Jeffrey Combs]] and [[Barbara Crampton]] on ''[[Re-Animator]]'', and he cast them in part because he had become used to working with a company of actors during his time in theater, and felt that doing the same thing with Lovecraft movies would allow the actors to adapt more quickly to his direction.<ref name=gallagher>{{cite book |last=Gallagher |first=John Andrew |chapter=Stuart Gordon |title=Film Directors on Directing |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group |year=1989 |page=[https://archive.org/details/filmdirectorsond00gall/page/98 98] |isbn=9780275932725 |chapter-url-access=registration |chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/filmdirectorsond00gall/page/98 }}</ref> He was interested in the possibility of making a series of [[H.

P. Lovecraft's Dreams in the Witch-House]]'', in 2005. Many members of the production staff for ''Re-Animator'' also held similar roles in the production of ''From Beyond'', including screenwriter [[Dennis Paoli]], producer [[Brian Yuzna]], executive producer [[Charles Band]], director of photography [[Mac Ahlberg]], and special effects artists [[John Carl Buechler]] and [[John Naulin]].<ref name=lukeman>{{cite book|last=Lukeman |first=Adam |title=Fangoria's 101 Best Horror Movies You've Never Seen: A Celebration of the World's Most Unheralded Fright Flicks |publisher=Three Rivers Press |year=2003 |isbn=9781400047499}}</ref>\n\n[[Albert Band]], who served as the production manager of ''From Beyond'', also makes an uncredited appearance as a wino.<ref name=lukeman /> Gordon's then-wife Carolyn Purdy-Gordon was cast in a small role in many of Gordon's films, and in ''From Beyond'' she played Dr. Bloch, the subject of the notorious eyeball-sucking scene.<ref>\"[https://filmthreat.com/uncategorized/cinema-cpr-the-films-of-stuart-gordon-2/ CINEMA CPR: THE FILMS OF STUART GORDON]\", Film Threat, March 23, 2005.</ref>\n\n''From Beyond'' was shot in Italy with an Italian crew in order to save money. Gordon says that the film would have cost fifteen million dollars to make in the United States, whereas the foreign production enabled him to hold costs to approximately two and a half million dollars.<ref name=gallagher_94>Gallagher, p. 94-95.</ref> It was shot on a soundstage called [[Dinocitta]] just outside Rome.<ref name=gallagher_94/> Dinocitta was originally constructed by [[Dino DeLaurentiis]], but was seized by the government for nonpayment of taxes, and then sold to [[Empire Studios]].<ref name=gallagher_94 /> ''From Beyond'' was one of the first films shot at that venue during its period of ownership by Empire.<ref name=gallagher_94 /> Gordon shot his film ''[[Dolls (1987 film)|Dolls]]'' at the same time, and it was released the following year.<ref name=lukeman />\n\nAs with his earlier film ''Re-Animator'', Gordon made use of medical advisors to be sure that the actions taken by the doctors and nurses of the film followed proper medical procedures.<ref>Gallagher, p. 93.</ref> Four separate special effects teams worked on the effects for ''From Beyond''.<ref name=lukeman /> According to Yuzna, the production ran out of money before the effects on the finale could be finished.<ref name=lukeman />\n\nAccording to Gordon, securing an \"R\" rating from the [[MPAA]] was a challenging ordeal, because the MPAA told him that it was the cumulative effect of the graphic content rather than any specific content in his first presented cut of the film that went beyond what audiences would expect from an \"R\" rated film, making it difficult for him to know what he needed to cut in order to get an \"R\" rating.<ref name=gallagher_94 /> He submitted multiple cuts of the film to the MPAA, each time making small trims without removing any entire sequences, before they at last sent him a message that if he cut a single specific frame, they would give it an \"R\".<ref name=gallagher_94 /> He later said that this process ended up making the film stronger, since the final cut left more to the viewer's imagination and gave viewers less time to study the special effects and figure out how they were done.<ref name=gallagher_94 />\n\n== Release ==\n[[MGM]] released an unrated cut of ''From Beyond'', containing the footage which was deleted from the film in order to get it an \"R\" rating. ''From Beyond'' had previously only been released in its original R-rated form. This longer, \"director's cut\" version aired on the [[Monsters HD|Monsters HD Channel]] and was subsequently released on DVD by MGM on September 11, 2007.\n\nOn March 26, 2013, [[Scream Factory]] released a Collector's Edition of the unrated \"director's cut\" of ''From Beyond'' on a Blu-ray/DVD combo pack.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://comingsoon.net/horror/news/730710-blu-ray-dates-for-phantasm-ii-a-the-beyond |title=Blu-ray Dates for Phantasm II & From Beyond |first=Ryan|last=Turek|date=December 7, 2012|access-date=July 3, 2018|work=ComingSoon.net|publisher=[[CraveOnline Media]]}}</ref>\n\n== Awards and reception ==\nThe film received generally positive reviews from critics.
