S. Lewis]]'s [[epic film|epic]] [[fantasy]] series, ''[[The Chronicles of Narnia]]''. It is the second in ''[[The Chronicles of Narnia (film series)|The Chronicles of Narnia]]'' film series from [[Walden Media]], following ''[[The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe]]'' (2005).\n\n[[William Moseley (actor)|William Moseley]], [[Anna Popplewell]], [[Skandar Keynes]], [[Georgie Henley]], [[Liam Neeson]], and [[Tilda Swinton]] reprise their roles from the first film, while new cast includes [[Ben Barnes (actor)|Ben Barnes]], [[Sergio Castellitto]], [[Peter Dinklage]], [[Eddie Izzard]], [[Warwick Davis]], [[Ken Stott]], and [[Vincent Grass]]. In the film, the four Pevensie children return to Narnia to aid [[Caspian X|Prince Caspian]] in his struggle with the \"secret\" help of [[Aslan]] for the throne against his corrupt uncle, King [[Miraz]].\n\n''Prince Caspian'', a British-American production, is the last ''Narnia'' film to be co-produced by [[Walt Disney Pictures]], as  [[20th Century Fox]] became the distributor for the next film ''[[The Chronicles of Narnia: The Voyage of the Dawn Treader]]'' due to budgetary disputes between Disney and [[Walden Media]], but as a result of [[Acquisition of 21st Century Fox by Disney|Disney eventually purchasing Fox]] on March 20, 2019, Disney now owns the rights to all three ''Narnia'' movies.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.narniaweb.com/2019/03/after-fox-takeover-disney-now-owns-all-three-walden-narnia-movies|title = After Fox Takeover, Disney Now Owns All Three Walden 'Narnia' Movies|date = March 20, 2019}}</ref> Work on the script began before ''The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe'' was released, so filming could begin before the actors grew too old for their parts.\n\nDirector [[Andrew Adamson]] wanted to make the film more spectacular than the first, and created an action sequence not in the novel. The Narnians were designed to look wilder as they have been hiding from persecution, stressing the darker tone of the [[sequel]]. The filmmakers also took a Spanish influence for the antagonistic race of the [[Telmarines]]. Filming began in February 2007 in New Zealand, but unlike the previous film, the majority of shooting took place in Central Europe, because of the larger sets available in those countries. To keep costs down, Adamson chose to base post-production in the UK, because of recent [[tax credit]]s there.\n\n''The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian'' premiered on May 7, 2008, at the [[Ziegfeld Theatre (1969)|Ziegfeld Theatre]] in [[New York City]], before it was theatrically released on May 16 in the United States and on June 26 in the United Kingdom. The film received mostly positive reviews from film critics. Many praised the performances and visual effects; however, the film's darker tone and mature themes drew polarizing opinions. It was a moderate success at the box office, grossing $55 million during its opening weekend. By the end of its theatrical run, it had grossed over $419.7 million worldwide. The film became the [[2008 in film#Highest-grossing films|10th-highest-grossing film worldwide in 2008]].\n\n== Plot ==\n<!-- Please review WP:FILMPLOT before adding material. Plot summaries are recommended to be 400-700 words. -->\nIn [[Narnia (world)|Narnia]], almost 1,300 years after the [[Pevensie]] siblings left, [[Caspian X|Caspian]], a [[Telmarine]] prince, is awoken by his mentor [[Doctor Cornelius]], who informs him that his aunt has just given birth to a son and that his life is now in grave danger. Cornelius gives him [[Susan Pevensie|Queen Susan's]] ancient magical horn and instructs him to use it if he is in dire need of help. Knowing that his Uncle [[Miraz]] would kill him in order to be king, Caspian flees. Chased by several Telmarine soldiers, Caspian falls off his horse and encounters two Narnian dwarfs and a talking badger in the woods. One of the dwarfs, [[Trumpkin]], is captured by the soldiers after sacrificing himself to save Caspian, while the other dwarf, Nikabrik, and the badger, Trufflehunter, save Caspian. Not knowing that they are trying to save him, Caspian blows the magical horn, trying to summon help.\n\nIn [[England]], the four Pevensie children wait at the [[Charing Cross tube station|Strand tube station]] for their train which will take them to [[boarding school]]. One year has passed in their world after they left Narnia. Just as the train pulls into the station, the station tears apart transporting them back to Narnia. There, they discover their castle, [[Cair Paravel]], was attacked and ruined in their absence. The Pevensies save a bound and gagged Trumpkin, who is about to be drowned, and they set off together. Lucy sees Aslan trying to show them a safe path, but finds her siblings unable to see him, she later manages to contact him in a dream, but only Edmund believes her.\n\nMeanwhile, Nikabrik and Trufflehunter lead Caspian to the Dancing Lawn, where all the old Narnians have assembled. Caspian convinces them to help him win his throne. Caspian and his troops encounter the Pevensies and Trumpkin, and they journey together to Aslan's How, a huge underground hall built over the [[Stone Table]]. Lucy wants to wait for Aslan, but [[Peter Pevensie|Peter]] decides they have waited long enough and suggests attacking Miraz's castle. The Narnians succeed in infiltrating the castle, but Caspian, learning that Miraz is responsible for his father's death, goes to confront his uncle. He is wounded by a crossbolt, Miraz escapes, and Peter calls for a retreat when the gate is sabotaged. Half of the Narnians manage to escape, but the rest are trapped behind the closed gate and brutally slaughtered by crossbowmen.\n\nNikabrik tells Caspian that there is a way he can claim his throne and guarantee Miraz's death. When Caspian agrees, a [[hag]] uses black sorcery to summon the [[White Witch]]. From inside a wall of ice, the Witch tries to convince Caspian to give her a drop of his blood in order to resurrect her. Peter, Edmund, Trumpkin and Lucy arrive and dispatch Nikabrik while Edmund shatters the wall of ice before the Witch can be freed.\n\nMiraz and his army arrive at Aslan's How. Peter challenges Miraz to a one-on-one duel, in order to buy Lucy time to find Aslan. Peter is able to wound Miraz, and gives his sword to Caspian to finish him off. Caspian, who cannot bring himself to do it, spares Miraz's life but says that he intends to give Narnia back to its people. Lord Sopespian, one of Miraz's generals, suddenly stabs and kills Miraz with an arrow and blames the Narnians, igniting a massive battle between the Narnians and the Telmarines. Lucy, meanwhile, has found Aslan in the woods; he awakens the [[Dryad|trees]] and the whole forest suddenly attacks the Telmarines. Lord Sopespian orders the retreat, only to be confronted by Lucy and Aslan. Aslan summons a [[river god]], which wipes out the majority of the Telmarine army, including Sopespian; all of the surviving Telmarine soldiers surrender and hand over their weapons.\n\nCaspian becomes the King of Narnia and, with Aslan's help, brings peace between the Narnian and Telmarine kingdoms. Before the Pevensies depart, Peter and Susan reveal that Aslan has told them they will never re-enter Narnia again since they have learned all they can from Narnia, but Lucy and Edmund might still come back. Susan kisses Caspian, knowing she will never see him again, before the Pevensies return to England, leaving Caspian as King of Narnia.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{See also|List of The Chronicles of Narnia (film series) cast members}}\n\n; Pevensies\n* [[William Moseley (actor)|William Moseley]] as [[Peter Pevensie]]. In a departure from the novel, Peter has a rivalry with Caspian. Moseley explained, \"Peter's got his own issues to deal with, and Caspian's got his own issues to deal with, and when neither is willing to compromise, there's bound to be friction. Peter came back to Narnia expecting to be king again and that everyone would do as he said, and Caspian is unwilling to let him take over, so that causes some of it. That's really what happens. And it's a lot about humility. I think they both have to learn a certain humility [...] and that's really what a great king needs is to be humble, to listen to his people, to be willing to compromise, and they start off as these sort of angry teenagers, and become kings at the end.\" In real life, the two actors got on well together. Moseley also stated that he identified with Peter, having gone back to school between shooting both films.<ref>{{cite news | author = Edward Douglas | title = William Moseley is Peter Pevensie | publisher = Comingsoon.net | date = October 19, 2007 | url = https://www.comingsoon.net/news/interviewsnews.php?id=38420 | access-date=November 24, 2007}}</ref> He trained for three months in New York City to improve his performance and his physicality.<ref name=nycwillandgeorgie>{{cite news | title = NYC Interview Series: Will and Georgie | publisher = NarniaWeb | date = May 16, 2008 | url = http://www.narniaweb.com/news.asp?id=1749&dl=18688065 | access-date=May 16, 2008}}</ref> \n* [[Anna Popplewell]] as [[Susan Pevensie]], the second oldest Pevensie.
