It is based on the novel of the same name by [[Seth Margolis]]. The screenplay is written by [[Naomi Foner Gyllenhaal]]. The original music score is composed by [[Mark Isham]].\n\n==Plot==\nWhile craving her next hit, Khaila Richards ([[Halle Berry]]), an African-American [[crack cocaine]] [[addiction|addict]], abandons her infant illegitimate son, Isaiah, in the dumpster. She promises to \"come back later\", but then passes out from the drugs. The next day, the infant narrowly escapes death in the garbage truck. Baby Isaiah is sent to the [[hospital]], where they discover he is also addicted to crack through his mother's addiction. While caring for Isaiah, a [[social worker]] named Margaret Lewin ([[Jessica Lange]]) grows increasingly fond of him and eventually [[adoption|adopts]] him to live with her and her husband, Charles ([[David Strathairn]]) and daughter, Hannah. Meanwhile, Khaila is caught [[shoplifting]] and is sent to [[drug rehabilitation|rehab]], unaware Isaiah is alive.\n\nThree years later, Khaila successfully completes her treatment and confesses to her case worker that she abandoned Isaiah in the alley. Unknown to Khaila, the case worker investigates and discovers Isaiah's adoption. They hire a lawyer, Kadar Lewis ([[Samuel L. Jackson]]) to contest the [[adoption]]. An ugly court battle ensues, with racial issues demonstrating inadequacies on both sides. The judge overturns the adoption, returning Isaiah to Khaila, much to the Lewins' horror and sadness.\n\nEven after weeks pass, a distraught Isaiah does not consider Khaila his mother. Although he becomes increasingly withdrawn, he is also prone to violent public outbursts. Eventually, Khaila is desperate for Isaiah's happiness, and asks Margaret to step back in \"for a little while... until he can understand.\" However, she insists she will also continue to be involved. The two mothers embrace each other, both proclaiming their equally strong motherly love for Isaiah. The two mothers then begin together playing building blocks with their beloved boy in a classroom.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Jessica Lange]] as Margaret Lewin\n*[[Halle Berry]] as Khaila Richards\n*[[David Strathairn]] as Charles Lewin\n*[[Cuba Gooding Jr.]] as Eddie Hughes\n*[[Samuel L.
