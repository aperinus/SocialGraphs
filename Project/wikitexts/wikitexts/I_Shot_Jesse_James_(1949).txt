The story is built around a fictional rivalry between Ford and his eventual killer [[Edward Capehart O'Kelley|Edward Kelley]] (called John in the film) over a woman. ''I Shot Jesse James'' is Samuel Fuller's first movie, and stars [[Reed Hadley]] as Jesse James and [[John Ireland (actor)|John Ireland]] as Bob Ford.\n\nThe film was released on video by the [[Criterion Collection]]'s Eclipse imprint together with ''[[The Baron of Arizona]]'' and ''[[The Steel Helmet]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.criterion.com/films/882-i-shot-jesse-james|title=I Shot Jesse James|website=Criterion.com|access-date=December 25, 2021}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nBob Ford of the Jesse James gang is wounded during a bank robbery. He mends at Jesse's home in Missouri for six months, although Jesse's wife Zee doesn't trust him.\n\nCynthy Waters, an actress Bob is in love with, comes to town to perform on stage. Bob catches her speaking with John Kelley, a prospector, and is jealous. He knows that Cynthy wants to get married and settle down.\n\nIn need of money, Bob hears of the governor's $10,000 reward for Jesse. He betrays his friend, shooting Jesse in the back. Bob is pardoned by the governor but receives a reward for just $500.\n\nHe spends the money on an engagement ring. Harry Kane, who manages Cynthy's career, books Bob for stage appearances in which he re-enacts the shooting of Jesse. He is booed by audiences and mocked in public for his cowardly deed.\n\nBob goes to Colorado to try prospecting and runs into Kelley, who is rejecting offers to become Creede's town marshal. Bob wakes up one day to find both Kelley and the engagement ring missing. Cynthy arrives just as Kelley returns, having captured the ring's thief. Kelley is disappointed when Cynthy accepts Bob's proposal, so he accepts the job as marshal.\n\nFrank James, brother of Jesse, overhears a conversation in which Cynthy confides to Kelley that he's the one she truly loves. Frank makes sure that Bob learns of this, knowing Bob will make the fatal mistake of confronting Kelley face to face. In the street, Bob draws on Kelley and is shot dead. Kelley gets the girl and Frank avenges his brother's death.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Preston Foster]] as John Kelley\n*[[Barbara Britton]] as Cynthy Waters\n*[[John Ireland (actor)|John Ireland]] as [[Robert Ford (outlaw)|Bob Ford]]\n*[[Reed Hadley]] as [[Jesse James]]\n*[[J.
