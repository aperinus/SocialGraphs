The film stars [[Matthew Modine]], [[Eric Stoltz]], and [[Harry Connick Jr.]] (in his film debut). ''Memphis Belle'' is a fictional version of the 1944 [[Documentary film|documentary]] ''[[Memphis Belle: A Story of a Flying Fortress]]'' by director [[William Wyler]], about the 25th and last mission of an American [[Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress]] [[bomber]], the ''[[Memphis Belle (aircraft)|Memphis Belle]]'', based in [[England]] during [[World War II]].<ref>Orriss 1984, p. 83.</ref> The 1990 version was co-produced by David Puttnam and Wyler's daughter Catherine and dedicated to her father. The film closes with a dedication to all airmen, friend or foe, who fought in the skies above Europe during World War II.\n\n==Plot==\nThe ''Memphis Belle'', a [[Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress|B-17 Flying Fortress]], and her crew are set to complete 25 missions, a prerequisite for the crew to complete their [[tour of duty]]. Along with the rest of the squadron, ''Belle'' is given the task of attacking a [[Focke Wulf 190]] aircraft [[manufacturing plant]] in [[Bremen, Germany]]. Though initially escorted by [[P-47 Thunderbolt|P-47s]], the short-range fighters have to eventually withdraw, leaving the vulnerable bombers to fend for themselves to the target and back. The success of ''Belle'' carries a lot of significance in that she would be the first in the [[United States Eighth Air Force|Eighth Air Force]] to complete her tour. Army publicist Lieutenant Colonel Bruce Derringer intends on using ''Belle's'' fame accrued from her record to sell vital [[war bonds]].\n\nOver Germany, ''Belle'' takes over as lead ship when the formation begins to take losses from [[flak]] and enemy planes. A [[smoke screen]] initially obscures the target, though on the second pass the formation successfully drops their payload on the now visible area. Returning home, the formation is continuously harassed by German planes. Radioman [[Staff Sergeant|SSgt.]] Danny Daly is severely wounded, and damage causes a fire in one of the engines which Captain Dearborn is forced to extinguish by diving the plane, risking the aircraft in the process.\n\nFurther battle damage destroys the plane's electric systems that power the landing gear, though the crew successfully deploy the gear manually just prior to landing. Back on friendly soil, Lt. Colonel Derringer and the ground crew run to the plane to celebrate its victory, with Captain Dearborn opening a stowed bottle of [[Champagne]] aboard the aircraft with his crew. The closing credits state that the ''Memphis Belle'' flew her 25th and final mission on May 17, 1943, and that over a quarter of a million aircraft saw action over [[Air warfare of World War II|Western Europe during World War Two]], with 200,000 airmen losing their lives and the film being dedicated in theirs and every serviceman's honour.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Matthew Modine]] as Captain Dennis Dearborn, pilot: A humourless and socially inept perfectionist.\n* [[Tate Donovan]] as 1st Lt. Luke Sinclair, co-pilot: The carefree former lifeguard believes himself to be undervalued by Dearborn.\n* [[D.B. Sweeney]] as 1st Lt. Phil Lowenthal, navigator: Lowenthal is nervous before their final mission and convinced that he is doomed to die.\n* [[Billy Zane]] as 1st Lt. Val Kozlowski, bombardier: While everyone believes the confident, self-assured Kozlowski to be a doctor, it is later revealed he attended only two weeks of medical school before enlisting.\n* [[Eric Stoltz]] as Staff Sgt. (T/3) Danny \"Danny Boy\" Daly, radio operator: An earnest [[Irish Americans|Irish-American]], Daly was editor of the school paper, a valedictorian, and joined up right after graduating college.\n* [[Reed Diamond]] as Staff Sgt. (T/3) Virgil \"Virge\" or \"Virgin\" Hoogesteger, top turret gunner and flight engineer: Hoogesteger worked for his family's restaurant and plans to open a chain of identical restaurants after the war despite his crew-mate's warnings that such an unheard of enterprise could never succeed.\n* [[Sean Astin]] as Staff Sgt. Richard \"Rascal\" Moore, [[ball turret]] gunner: The diminutive, often crude gunner considers himself a ladies' man and delights in teasing his crewmates.\n* [[Courtney Gains]] as Staff Sgt. Eugene \"Genie\" McVey, right waist gunner. A Catholic [[Irish-American]] from [[Cleveland]].\n* [[Neil Giuntoli]] as Sgt. Jack Bocci, left waist gunner: A hot-tempered [[Chicago]] hoodlum, Bocci appears to look out only for himself but proves surprisingly kind to his fellow waist gunner McVey. \n* [[Harry Connick Jr.]] as Staff Sgt. Clay Busby, tail gunner: After his father lost the family farm in a poker game, the laconic Busby earned money playing the piano in a [[New Orleans]] [[Brothel|cathouse]].\n* [[David Strathairn]] as Col. Craig Harriman\n* [[John Lithgow]] as Lt. Col. Bruce Derringer\n* [[Jane Horrocks]] as Faith\n* [[Mac McDonald]] as Les\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Boeing B-17G Flying Fortress '124485 - DF-A' (G-BEDF) (14423153306).jpg|thumb|right|B-17G \"Sally B\".]]\nFive real B-17 [[warbird]]s were used in the filming of ''Memphis Belle'', out of eight B-17s that were airworthy during the late 1980s. Two were located in America (N3703G and N17W), two were in France (F-BEEA, which was destroyed in a takeoff accident<ref name=\"AAIB 11/89\">[http://www.aaib.gov.uk/cms_resources/Boeing%20B17G%20Flying%20Fortress,%20F-BEEA%2011-89.pdf \"Boeing B17G Flying Fortress, F-BEEA 11-89 .\"] ''[[Air Accident Investigation Branch]]''. Retrieved: 27 October 2014.)</ref> and F-AZDX [[The Pink Lady (aircraft)|''The Pink Lady'']]), and one was in England (G-BEDF ''[[Sally B]]''). The original Memphis Belle was a B-17F model, so any B-17Gs used in the film were heavily modified to look like an earlier F model, having chin turrets removed, tail gun positions retrofitted with older designs and being painted olive drab green. During filming, two B-17s portrayed the Belle (one was the movie version of the ''Memphis Belle'' (N3703G) and the other was ''Sally B'' for scenes requiring pyrotechnics such as smoke and sparks indicating machine gun \"hits\") while the rest had nose art and squadron markings changed numerous times to make it appear there were more aircraft.<ref>Farmer 1990. p. 31.</ref>\n\nGround sequences for the movie (including takeoff and landing scenes) were filmed at the non-operational [[RAF Binbrook]] in [[Lincolnshire]], England with a period control tower and vehicles being placed on site. Flying sequences were flown from the airfield site of the [[Imperial War Museum Duxford]]. All the [[Extra (actor)|extras]] for the film were obtained from auditions held in the area and included current and former members of the [[Royal Air Force]]. The filmmakers also used [[Pinewood Studios]] to shoot interior scenes and to shoot various models of B-17s.<ref>[http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/83270/Memphis-Belle/original-print-info.html \"Original print information: Memphis Belle (1990).\"] ''Turner Classic Movies''. Retrieved: 27 October 2014.</ref>\n\nA [[North American B-25 Mitchell]] was used to film the majority of the aerial scenes with several fixed and trainable cameras also mounted on the available B-17s and fighter aircraft for action shots. A [[Grumman TBM Avenger]] (with its tail section painted the same olive drab tones used on the B-17s) was used as back-up for a short time when the B-25 became unserviceable during filming.<ref>Carlson 2012 p. 120.</ref>\n\nThe film pilots were warbird display pilots coming from the UK, USA, France, Germany, New Zealand and Norway, the roster changing several times as pilots had to return to their full-time jobs during filming. The flying sequences were devised and planned under the coordination of Old Flying Machine Company (OFMC) pilots [[Ray Hanna]] and his son Mark, who also acted as chief pilots for the fighter aircraft used and flew the camera-equipped fighter and TBM Avenger aircraft during filming.<ref>Farmer 1990. p. 37.</ref>\n\nDue to a shortage of actual B-17 airframes, wooden [[silhouette]] mock-ups were made and placed at distant parts of the airfield.\n\n===Filming accident===\nA French B-17G (F-BEEA), used as a filming platform, hit a tree and a pile of gravel after losing engine power and swinging during takeoff from Binbrook and was destroyed by the subsequent fire. All 10 of the crew escaped with only minor injuries, the most serious of which being a broken leg. While lined up on runway 21 awaiting takeoff, a puff of smoke was observed by a ground engineer from the vicinity of engine three which he conjectured could have been due to an over-boost. The aircraft commenced its ground roll and after about 100 yards swung slightly to the left, which the commander (the handling pilot) corrected with the rudder and by reducing power to number 3 and 4 engines. Once corrected full power on all engines was resumed but the aircraft swung right. The commander applied corrective rudder and reduced power to number 1 and 2 engines, but this was not immediately effective and the aircraft left the runway before straightening, parallel to the runway. Knowing that the aircraft was capable of being operated from grass landing strips, the pilot opted to continue the takeoff; however, after 400\u2013500 yards and at an airspeed of 90-95&nbsp;mph the aircraft swung right and its course was obstructed by a tree which was hit by the left wing and a pile of gravel which was hit by the number 4 propeller. The aircraft yawed to the right and came to rest in a cornfield; the fuselage broke into two sections aft of the bomb bay and caught fire.<ref name=\"AAIB 11/89\" />\n\n==Historical accuracy==\nWith the exception of the aircraft names, this film is fiction based only very loosely on fact. The characters are composites, the names are not those of the real crew of the ''Memphis Belle'' and the incidents shown are supposed to be representative of B-17 missions in general. The characters and situations of the film bear little resemblance to the crew of the actual ''Memphis Belle,'' the nature of her final mission, the accuracy of strategic bombing, or Allied policy on the bombing of civilians. No optimistic official celebration on the evening before the ''Belle's'' 25th mission occurred, and there was no special welcome for the crew when the mission was over.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n\nFor the fighters, seven P-51 Mustangs were used. Five of the P-51s were painted in the markings of the first USAAF [[Rolls-Royce Merlin|Merlin]]-engined Mustang squadron to operate in Britain (a few months later in 1943 than the actual mission).{{#tag:ref|[[Republic P-47 Thunderbolt|P-47 Thunderbolts]] were the escort at the time in 1943.<ref>Farmer 1990. p. 32.</ref>|group=N}} As there were no surviving flyable Messerschmitt Bf 109s, Luftwaffe fighter aircraft were represented by [[Hispano Aviaci\u00f3n HA-1112|Ha-1112]]s, a Spanish version of the Bf 109 (which were also used to represent Bf 109s in the 1969 film [[Battle of Britain (film)|''Battle of Britain'']]) in mid-war generic paint schemes.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n\n==Soundtrack==\n{{Infobox album\n| name       = Memphis Belle (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack)\n| type       = [[soundtrack]]\n| artist     = [[George Fenton]]\n| cover      =\n| caption    = \n| alt        =\n| released   = 1 October 1990\n| recorded   = [[Abbey Road Studios]],<br />CTS Studios, and<br />[[Angel Recording Studios]],<br />[[London, England]]\n| venue      =\n| studio     =\n| genre      = [[Soundtrack]]\n| length     = 42:47\n| label      = [[Var\u00e8se Sarabande]]\n| producer   = {{plainlist|\n* [[George Fenton]]\n* [[Eliza Thompson]]\n}}\n| prev_title =\n| prev_year  =\n| next_title =\n| next_year  =\n}}\n\n\"The Chestnut Tree\", performed by [[Glenn Miller Orchestra|Glenn Miller And His Orchestra]] and written by [[Tommie Connor]], [[Jimmy Kennedy]] and Hamilton Kennedy is featured in the film playing over the Memphis Belle's radio, but isn't on the soundtrack album.

We can't really tell the crew members apart and don't much care to, but we can identify with them.\"<ref>{{cite news|last=Ebert|first=Roger|author-link=Roger Ebert|url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/memphis-belle-1990|title=Memphis Belle]|newspaper=[[Chicago Sun Times]]|via=Roger Ebert.com|date=12 October 1990}}</ref> UK film reviewer Andy Webb had similar reservations. \"Despite its good intentions to highlight the risks and heroics of the brave men who flew dangerous bombing missions deep into enemy soil during World War II, the one thing which you can't miss about ''Memphis Belle'' is that it is a cliche commercial production.\"<ref>Webb, Andy. \"[http://www.themoviescene.co.uk/reviews/memphis-belle/memphis-belle.html Memphis Belle (1990)]\".
