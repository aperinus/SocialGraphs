An abridged version of the film was released as '''''Queen Margot''''' in North America, and in the United Kingdom under its original French title.\n\nIt won the [[Jury Prize (Cannes Film Festival)|Jury Prize]] and [[Best Actress Award (Cannes Film Festival)|Best Actress Award]] at the [[1994 Cannes Film Festival|Cannes Film Festival]], as well as five [[C\u00e9sar Award]]s.

Catherine decides to make an overture of goodwill by offering up her daughter [[Margaret of Valois|Margot]] in marriage to [[Henry IV of France|Henri de Bourbon]], a prominent Huguenot and [[Kingdom of Navarre|King of Navarre]], although she also schemes to bring about the notorious [[St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre]] of 1572, when thousands of Protestants are slaughtered. The marriage goes forward but Margot, who does not love Henri, begins a passionate affair with the soldier [[Joseph Boniface de La M\u00f4le|La M\u00f4le]], also a Protestant from a well-to-do family. Murders by poisoning follow, as court intrigues multiply and Queen Catherine's villainous plotting to place her son the Duke of Anjou on the throne threatens the lives of La M\u00f4le, Margot and Henri of Navarre. A book with pages painted with [[arsenic]] is intended for Henri but instead causes the slow, agonizing death of King Charles. Henri escapes to Navarre and sends La M\u00f4le to fetch Margot, but Guise apprehends him. La M\u00f4le is beheaded in the [[Bastille]] before Margot can save him, and King Charles finally dies. Margot escapes carrying La M\u00f4le's embalmed head as Anjou is proclaimed King of France as [[Henry III of France|Henry III]].\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Isabelle Adjani]] as [[Margaret of Valois]], \"Queen Margot\"\n* [[Daniel Auteuil]] as Henri de Bourbon, future [[Henry IV of France|Henry IV]]\n* [[Jean-Hugues Anglade]] as [[Charles IX of France|Charles IX]]\n* [[Vincent Perez]] as [[Joseph Boniface de La M\u00f4le|La M\u00f4le]]\n* [[Virna Lisi]] as [[Catherine de' Medici]]\n* [[Dominique Blanc]] as [[Henriette de Nevers]]\n* [[Pascal Greggory]] as Henri, Duke of Anjou, later [[Henry III of France|Henry III]]\n* [[Claudio Amendola]] as Coconnas\n* [[Miguel Bos\u00e9]] as [[Henry I, Duke of Guise]]\n* [[Asia Argento]] as [[Charlotte de Sauve]]\n* [[Julien Rassam]] as [[Francis, Duke of Anjou|Fran\u00e7ois, Duke of Alen\u00e7on]]\n* [[Thomas Kretschmann]] as Nan\u00e7ay\n* [[Jean-Claude Brialy]] as [[Gaspard II de Coligny|Admiral de Coligny]]\n* [[Jean-Philippe \u00c9coffey]] as Cond\u00e9\n* [[Johan Leysen]] as Maurevel\n* [[Laure Marsac]] as Antoinette\n* [[Barbet Schroeder]] as an advisor\n* [[Otto Tausig]] as Mend\u00e8s\n* [[Bruno Todeschini]] as Armagnac\n* [[Bernard Verley]] as the cardinal\n* [[Valeria Bruni Tedeschi]] as a courtesan\n* [[H\u00e9l\u00e8ne de Fougerolles]] as a courtesan\n* [[Gr\u00e9goire Colin]] as Young Egg\n* [[Jean Douchet]] as the bishop\n* [[Julie-Anne Roth]] as the kitchen girl\n* [[Nicolas Vaude]] as a protestant\n}}\n\n==Production==\nThe film was an international co-production between by several companies based in France, Germany, and Italy, with the additional participation of [[StudioCanal]] and the American company [[Miramax]] and the support of [[Eurimages]].
