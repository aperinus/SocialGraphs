The sequel to ''[[Harold & Kumar Escape from Guantanamo Bay]]'' (2008), it is the third installment [[Harold & Kumar|''Harold & Kumar'' franchise]], and stars [[John Cho]], [[Kal Penn]], and [[Neil Patrick Harris]]. The film follows estranged friends Harold Lee (Cho) and Kumar Patel (Penn) as they reunite to hunt for a Christmas tree.\n\nPreparations for the film began in May 2009, with Hurwitz, Schlossberg, and Strauss-Schulson signing soon thereafter. Cho, Harris, and Penn returned by June 2010, with the latter departing his role in the U.S. [[Office of Public Liaison]] to reprise his role in ''A Very Harold & Kumar Christmas''. [[Principal photography]] began later that month and lasted until that August, with filming locations including [[Detroit]], [[Los Angeles]], and [[New York City]]. Its marketing campaign used [[guerilla marketing|guerilla]] tactics led by Cho and Penn to promote the film's [[3D film|3D]] and [[animated film|animated]] elements, a new for the franchise.\n\n''A Very Harold & Kumar Christmas'' was theatrically released in the United States on November 4, 2011, by [[Warner Bros.]] The film received generally mixed critical reception, with praise for the Christmas theme and performances of Cho, Penn, and Harris, but criticism for some of its humor. \n\n==Plot==\nSeven years after [[Harold & Kumar Escape From Guantanamo Bay|escaping from]] [[Guantanamo Bay detention camp]], and two years after they have last spoken, best friends and roommates [[Harold Lee (character)|Harold Lee]] and [[Kumar Patel (character)|Kumar Patel]] have gone their separate ways. Harold has given up smoking [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]], become a successful businessman on [[Wall Street]] and married his [[Latino (demonym)|Latina]] girlfriend Maria. Kumar, on the other hand, is poor and still lives in the messy apartment he once shared with Harold after getting kicked out of medical school due to failing a drug test. Kumar has recently been dumped again by his girlfriend Vanessa, who arrives at Kumar's apartment to inform him that she is pregnant with his child. Maria's father and Harold's father-in-law Mr. Perez decides to stay at Harold and Maria's house for Christmas. Mr. Perez, who does not like Harold, brings his prized [[Abies fraseri|Christmas tree]] that he has been growing for eight years, and gives Harold a short lecture about the tree's importance. Kumar receives a package with Harold's name on it at his apartment and decides to deliver it to Harold. At Harold's house, they discover the item inside to be a large marijuana joint.\n\nKumar lights the joint, but Harold throws it out of the window, only for it to magically land in the tree and burn it down. Harold learns that Kumar's new friend Adrian is attending a party with a Fraser Fir Christmas tree, and promises to drive him to the party on the condition that he can have the tree. Harold, Kumar, Adrian, and Todd (Harold's new best friend) arrive at the party, where a girl named Mary attempts to seduce Harold, Mary is revealed to be the daughter of [[Russian mafia|Russian mob]] kingpin Sergei Katsov, who sends two of his men to kill Harold and Kumar, believing that they were trying to rape his daughter. The duo make it out of the building without the Christmas tree and run into their friends, Rosenberg and Goldstein, for the first time in years. Harold and Kumar plan to steal a tree from a church, but end up participating in a Christmas show featuring [[Neil Patrick Harris]], who they thought had died after being shot outside a Texas [[whorehouse]] seven years ago. Harris reveals that he did die, but [[Jesus Christ]] kicked him out of [[Heaven]]. Revealing that he is now telepathic, Harris hooks the pair up with a Christmas tree and a Wafflebot before sending them off.\n\nThe two make their way to Harold's house to put up the tree, but end up being kidnapped by two of Katsov's men, and are saved by Wafflebot. After Harold accidentally shoots [[Santa Claus]] in the head, Kumar gives him emergency surgery. In exchange for saving his life, Santa agrees to fly them back home in his sleigh, and reveals that he sent the package to reunite the friends. Harold arrives home to encounter Mr. Perez, who is angered when he discovers his Christmas tree is gone. Harold finally stands up to him, explaining that he may not be the perfect son-in-law, but he is the perfect guy for Maria. Mr. Perez says that he always knew Harold was a nice guy, he just wanted to make sure that he had \"[[Spanish profanity#Cojones|cojones]]\" before accepting him into his family. Harold and Kumar rekindle their friendship, Kumar and Vanessa rekindle their romance, and Kumar tells Vanessa that he will re-take the exams to become a doctor and give up weed for the sake of their child, however, Vanessa advises him to break the latter, promising to give him her urine for another drug test. Maria discovers that she is pregnant on Christmas morning and that Santa has left a replacement tree in their lounge. Harold decides to smoke weed again, and he and Kumar share a joint for the first time in years. Santa flies overhead, smoking a bong, wishing everyone a merry Christmas.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[John Cho]] as [[Harold Lee (character)|Harold Lee]]\n* [[Kal Penn]] as [[Kumar Patel (character)|Kumar Patel]]\n* [[Neil Patrick Harris]] as [[Harold & Kumar#Neil Patrick Harris|a fictionalized version of himself]] <!--PLEASE READ: HARRIS DOES NOT PLAY \"HIMSELF\", BUT HE DOES PLAY A CHARACTER BASED ON HIMSELF.
