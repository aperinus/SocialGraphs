It is the second installment in the [[Highlander (franchise)|''Highlander'' film series]], and sequel of the 1986 fantasy film ''[[Highlander (film)|Highlander]]''. Set in the year 2024, the plot concerns [[Connor MacLeod]], who regains his youth and immortal abilities and must free Earth from the Shield, an artificial [[ozone layer]] that has fallen under the control of a corrupt corporation. The film was shot almost entirely in [[Argentina]] before and after [[1989 riots in Argentina|the country's economy crashed]]; as the local economy experienced [[Argentine peso#Austral, 1985\u20131991|hyperinflation]], the film's investors and completion bond company took direct control of production and final edit, removing director Mulcahy and his creative influence while changing parts of the story.<ref name=Seduced>''Highlander II: Seduced by Argentina.''

This was followed by a ''Special Edition'' DVD release in 2004, which was largely the same cut as the ''Renegade Version'' but with some altered special effects. The sequel ''[[Highlander III: The Sorcerer]]'' follows the events of the first film, in the process contradicting and completely ignoring the events and revelations of ''Highlander II''.\n\n==Plot==\n{{Long plot|date=January 2021}}\nRoughly 500 years before the film takes place, on the planet Zeist, a last meeting is held between the members of a rebellion against the corrupt leadership and the ruthless General Katana. [[Juan S\u00e1nchez-Villalobos Ram\u00edrez]], a wise sorcerer who guides the rebellion, chooses the man called [[Connor MacLeod]], \"a man of great destiny\", to lead them against Katana. Ram\u00edrez then uses the Quickening, which he explains is a \"kind of\" magic, to create a bond between him and MacLeod that is stronger than death. Katana and his troops then attack, crushing the rebellion.\n\nRam\u00edrez and MacLeod are put on trial by Zeist's priests, who sentence them and other criminals to exile on Earth where they will be immortal. Locked into ageless lives, they will fight each other until there is only one left. The survivor will win the Prize: a choice to either remain on Earth as a mortal person and live out their days or return to Zeist, their past crimes forgiven. Katana is unsatisfied with their decision, but the sentence is executed; Ram\u00edrez and MacLeod are reborn on Earth, leading to the events of [[Highlander (film)|the original film]].\n\nIn 1985, after all other immortals on Earth are dead and [[The Kurgan]]\u2019s reign of terror is brought to an end, MacLeod wins the Prize. He becomes mortal and marries his new lover Brenda Wyatt. By August 1994, the [[ozone layer]] is fading and will be completely gone in a matter of months. Millions, including Brenda, perish from unfiltered solar radiation. Before dying, Brenda asks McLeod to promise he will solve the problem of the ozone layer. By 1999, MacLeod is the supervisor of a scientific team headed by Dr. Allan Neyman that creates an electromagnetic shield to protect the Earth from radiation. MacLeod and Neyman are proud to have saved humanity, but the shield means condemning the planet to no longer see the sky, stars, or sunlight, as well as an uncomfortably high average global temperature and high humidity. Unable to see the sky for decades, many begin to suffer from depression and loss of hope while human society continues to decline due to violence, greed, and crime. Many even grow to hate MacLeod, saying he ruined the world, ignoring the fact the ozone layer would have killed them if he did nothing.\n\nBy 2024, the shield has fallen under the control of The Shield Corporation (TSC) and chief executive David Blake, who impose heavy fees on countries that desire continued protection from solar radiation. Louise Marcus, a former employee of TSC, is a member of a radical activist group that believes the ozone layer has healed and that the shield is therefore no longer needed, and TSC is keeping this secret so the shield can continue providing a profit.\n\nNow a frail old man, MacLeod lives a solitary life. While watching a performance of [[Richard Wagner]]'s ''[[G\u00f6tterd\u00e4mmerung]]'', he remembers Ram\u00edrez and his past on Zeist. Meanwhile, on Zeist, the still-living General Katana considers that MacLeod may still choose to return to Zeist rather than die on Earth of natural causes. Unwilling to take that chance, Katana sends two henchmen, Corda and Reno, to kill him. A small cut on MacLeod's hand, delivered by a drunk, instantly heals and he realizes this means there are other immortals on Earth again.\n\nMarcus finds MacLeod and asks for his help in taking down the shield he helped create, explaining the ozone has healed. MacLeod declines, saying he is dying and does not approve of terrorism. Corda and Reno attack and MacLeod desperately tries to escape. When Corda winds up losing his head following a fight, MacLeod absorbs his power, regaining the youth and vitality he had before he won the Prize. He kills Reno and then instinctively summons Ram\u00edrez back to life. Louise witnesses this battle and becomes MacLeod's lover.\n\nIn [[Glencoe, Highland|Glencoe]], [[Scotland]] - the location of his death in the first ''Highlander'' film - Ram\u00edrez materializes alive and well, interrupting a play of [[Shakespeare]]'s [[Hamlet]]. Drawn to MacLeod's location, he pawns his earring to acquire a new sword, a new suit of clothes from Scotland's oldest and finest tailor, and a plane ticket to New York. Meanwhile, General Katana arrives from Zeist, determined to kill MacLeod himself. As soon as he arrives, he takes control of a subway car and sends it speeding out of control, killing all aboard. He briefly confronts MacLeod on holy ground (where they are forbidden to fight), taunting him before leaving. Ram\u00edrez then finds MacLeod and Louise and they make a plan to take down the shield.\n\nDeducing that MacLeod will target the shield, Katana allies himself with David Blake, who explains the energy required to counteract and disable the shield at this point could threaten Earth. When it is discovered that he has told MacLeod there is proof the ozone layer is healed, Neyman is fatally tortured. MacLeod, Ram\u00edrez, and Louise break into TSC. Using his magic, Ram\u00edrez sacrifices his life to save MacLeod from a trap. Blake is killed and MacLeod, wielding the sword he had before winning the Prize, has one final battle with Katana, decapitating him. Releasing his own immortal energy and the energy he absorbed from Katana, MacLeod succeeds in disrupting and removing the shield. Louise Marcus, along with many people on Earth, sees the stars and sky for the first time in her life.\n\nIn the UK theatrical release, an extended prologue better explains MacLeod's motives for creating the Shield, confirming his wife Brenda died from radiation poisoning. An extra scene shows MacLeod and Louise journeying above the Shield to confirm the ozone layer has repaired itself. In an extended ending, MacLeod returns to Zeist after destroying the Shield and is seen on the planet walking alongside Louise who has accompanied him (this has been dubbed by fans as the \"fairy tale ending\").<ref>{{cite web|last=Murphy|first=Sean|title=Highlander II: Three Versions Of A Film In Search Of Its Identity By Sean Murphy|url=http://www.figmentfly.com/published/highlander2article.html|access-date=13 October 2016|work=Figmentfly.com}}</ref>\n\n===Renegade Version/Special Edition===\nConnor MacLeod and the other immortals are human beings born with an energy called the Quickening that makes them invincible to death unless they are beheaded. MacLeod and a sorcerer named Ram\u00edrez are both immortals and inhabitants of a society on Earth that predates recorded history, during a time when magic and advanced technology co-exist. This society is ruled by a dictatorship that is enforced by the military leader General Katana, another immortal, but this rule is opposed by a group of revolutionaries that includes several immortals such as MacLeod and Ram\u00edrez. Ram\u00edrez declares MacLeod the new leader of the revolution and then uses ancient, nameless magic to bond their souls together. When MacLeod and Ram\u00edrez are captured by Katana's forces, the priests and Chief Justice overseeing the case decide to exile them and other immortal criminals to various points of Earth's future, long after their society will have fallen and been forgotten. If one of the immortal exiles is able to kill all the others, that immortal will win the Prize - full amnesty for their crimes and a choice: return to their true home in the distant past or remain in the future but now live as a mortal who will age and eventually die. Before they are separated, Ram\u00edrez promises that the bond between their souls means they can always find each other again, even beyond death. They are then transported to different points in the future.\n\nRam\u00edrez is reborn in Ancient Egypt and becomes a cunning but morally guided warrior. MacLeod is reborn as a Scottish Highlander in the 16th century, apparently not remembering his first life in the distant past. MacLeod eventually discovers he is immortal and soon afterward he is found by Ram\u00edrez who trains him to fight. The Egyptian warrior is then killed by another immortal, [[The Kurgan]]. [[Highlander (film)|Centuries later in New York]], MacLeod defeats the Kurgan, becoming the last immortal exile left alive, thus winning the Prize and becoming mortal. Since he never fully declares whether or not he chooses to remain or return, MacLeod still has the possibility of returning to the distant past and the society he originally called home. The first film ends with MacLeod stating that the Prize gave him the ability to know the thoughts and dreams of all people on Earth\u2014including, he notes, scientists whom he can help understand each other. A new flashback reveals that MacLeod then marries Brenda Wyatt, who dies in 1994 from solar radiation poisoning after Earth's ozone layer is destroyed. Before Brenda dies, she makes MacLeod swear that he will use the Prize to save Earth from the devastating effects of the dying ozone. To keep his promise to Brenda, MacLeod becomes directly involved in the creation of the Shield and protective of its use, until he is told the ozone layer is healed and later confirms this by journeying above the Shield with Louise.\n\nThe rest of the story that takes place in 2024 is largely similar to the original theatrical version, with flashbacks rearranged, additional scenes, and some scenes having minor changes. By 2024, MacLeod experiences flashbacks of his original life in the distant past and his war with Katana. It is unclear if this was a direct result of winning the Prize or if the memories came back naturally over time. Katana does not wish to risk that MacLeod may one day return home from the future, so he transports two immortal assassins to 2024. When they both end up beheaded, MacLeod absorbs their Quickening energies, regaining his youth and immortality. At the end, MacLeod releases his Quickening energy to overload and destroy the Shield, indicating he may now have become mortal again in the process. With the Shield gone, he embraces Louise and the two vanish in a burst of light that rises into the sky, indicating they have journeyed back to MacLeod's home in the distant past.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Christopher Lambert]] as Connor MacLeod\n* [[Sean Connery]] as Juan S\u00e1nchez-Villalobos Ram\u00edrez\n* [[Virginia Madsen]] as Louise Marcus\n* [[Michael Ironside]] as General Katana\n* [[Allan Rich]] as Allan Neyman\n* [[John C.

For similar reasons, Christopher Lambert threatened to walk out of the project when it was nearing fruition. However, due to contractual obligations, he did not.<ref name=Houston/>\n\nThe film's investors and completion bond company took direct control of production and final edit, removing director Mulcahy and his creative influence while changing parts of the story.<ref name=Seduced/> The resulting film contradicts the established canon of ''Highlander'' regarding the nature of immortals and MacLeod's past, such as depicting [[Immortal (Highlander)|immortals]] as aliens from the planet Zeist rather than human-born with energy connecting them to nature and making them unable to die unless beheaded. MacLeod's former mentor Ram\u00edrez, killed in the first film, is inexplicably resurrected and now depicted as an alien sorcerer. While the first film used the word \"[[Quickening (Highlander)|Quickening]]\" to refer to the energy that gives an immortal their power, ''Highlander II'' uses the term to refer to a magical force Ram\u00edrez uses to bond his soul to MacLeod's, allowing him to return from death when the Highlander needs him.\n\n===Alternate Ending===\nA once lost alternate ending, commonly known as ''The Fairytale Ending'', was shown only in some European theaters and has never been shown in any of the American cuts. The ending shows Connor magically returning to planet Zeist, taking Louise along with him, while Ram\u00edrez\u2019s voice is heard in the background. An early version of this ending is shown on the ''Special Edition''. It also includes footage of [[Virginia Madsen]] as Louise Marcus speaking to [[Christopher Lambert]] as Connor MacLeod. Madsen is on location while Lambert is suspended by wires in front of a blue screen. After a brief exchange where Connor asks Louise to come with him, the theatrical ending is shown where the two embrace in front of a field of stars, then transform into light streaks and fly off into space.\n\n==Release==\n===UK Release===\n''Highlander II: The Quickening'' was released in the UK on 12 April 1991 with a runtime of 100 minutes. This version was distributed by [[Entertainment Film Distributors]] and ran 8 minutes longer than the US cut.\n\nAs well as a very different scene order this version included additional footage not seen in the later US Theatrical release; including a flashback to the death of Connor's previous wife Brenda, a sequence of Connor and Louise going above the shield, and the alternate \"Fairytale Ending\" mentioned above.\n\nDespite this longer version running in UK theatres, all home video releases in the country to date have been of the shorter 91-minute US Theatrical Release (running 86 minutes due to PAL speedup). This includes the rental VHS (EVV 1203), retail VHS (EVS 1072), laserdisc (PLFEB 37011), and DVD (EDV 9119).\n\n===United States Release===\n''Highlander II: The Quickening'' was released in the United States on 1 November 1991 with a runtime of 91 minutes, distributed by [[Westinghouse Broadcasting|InterStar Releasing]]. This version was edited down by the bond company, with many scenes rearranged throughout. Despite the many cuts made to this version the bond company also added two new scenes that further fleshed out the villain, General Katana. These scenes include; Katana taunting Connor in his Zeist prison cell, and Connor and Katana meeting at the grave of Connor's dead wife, Brenda.\n\nThis version was released many times in the US, including on VHS, laserdisc, and Video8. All DVD and Blu-Ray releases of the film in the United States have been of the longer \"Renegade\" and \"Special Edition\" versions.\n\n===Marketing===\nA $1 million television advertising campaign was run for the release of the film.<ref>{{cite news |title=Entertainment Films Launches #1M Advertising Campaign Through Laing Henry Hill Holliday |date=12 April 1991 |work=[[Marketing Week]] |page=13 |publisher=[[Centaur Communications]] Limited |issn=0141-9285}}</ref>\n\n===Home media===\nIn the United States, the theatrical cut was released on [[VHS]] on 13 May 1992<ref>{{cite news |title=Relive the Winter Olympics on tape |first=Bruce |last=Westbrook |date=17 April 1992 |work=[[Houston Chronicle]] |page=2 STAR 3 |issn=1074-7109}}</ref> by [[Sony Pictures Home Entertainment|Columbia TriStar Home Video]],<ref>{{cite news |title=Monsters and more: Mayhem for month |date=30 April 1992 |work=[[The Washington Times]] |page=2 |issn=0732-8494}}</ref> and was reissued on 13 April 1994 by [[Hemdale Film Corporation|Hemdale Home Video]].<ref>{{Cite book|last=Nielsen Business Media|first=Inc.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OQgEAAAAMBAJ&q=highlander+2+hemdale&pg=PA58|title=Billboard|date=1994-04-02|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc. }}</ref>\n\n====Renegade Version====\nIn 1995, Mulcahy made a [[director's cut]] version known as the ''Renegade Version,'' which became the main version of the film available as the original theatrical cut did not have enough demand to warrant further production for home media. As a result, many fans in later years were only able to find the ''Renegade Version'' for viewing rather than the original theatrical release. The ''Renegade Version'' was reconstructed largely from existing material; certain scenes were removed and others added back in and entire sequences of events were changed. All references to the Immortals being aliens from another planet called Zeist were eliminated. New sequences include a battle between MacLeod and Katana atop a moving vehicle after they escape the security facility, and MacLeod and Louise climb through a mountain tunnel to emerge above the Shield to confirm that the radiation levels are back to normal (a scene previously only seen in the UK cut). The new version removes a major continuity gaffe from the theatrical version, which had merged two separate sword fights between MacLeod and Katana into one longer climactic battle. The director's cut version restores them to two separate battles, although it never shows how or when Connor reacquired his katana.{{citation needed|date=June 2021}}\n\n====Special Edition====\nProducers Panzer and Davis revisited ''Highlander II'' once again in 2004. Dubbed the \"Special Edition\", this cut was nearly identical to the ''Renegade Version'', but with a few alterations, such as the introduction of new CGI special effects throughout the film, including a now-blue shield as originally intended, and a small piece of voice-over work by Lambert. As the original cut of the film is no longer distributed, many fans in later years have only had the ''Regenade Version'' and ''Special Edition'' available to watch.\n\nReviewing the 2004 \"Special Edition\" DVD, David Ryan of DVD Verdict gave it a score of 69 out of 100 and said that \"[this] is the best version of this film that [the producers] can make with the material they have on hand. It's still not a particularly good film\u2014but it's ''infinitely'' superior to the original version... What was once a horrible, horrible film has become downright tolerable, and actually somewhat entertaining at times.\"<ref>{{cite web |last=Ryan |first=Judge |url=http://www.dvdverdict.com/reviews/highlander2se.php |title=Highlander 2: Special Edition |publisher=Dvdverdict.com |date=27 August 2004 |access-date=2012-01-31 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306021342/http://www.dvdverdict.com/reviews/highlander2se.php |archive-date=6 March 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Box office===\nThe film was released months later in the US on 1 November 1991, and opened at #3, grossing $5.3 million in 960 theaters in the opening weekend.

I really can't. ''Highlander II'' is awful. It's not even \"so bad it's good\" territory, it skips right past that into the \"so awful you can't look away for fear you'll both be killed\" territory. And amazingly, it manages to not only be contender for worst film in the world, but it also runs the entire franchise into the ground and retcons the first film into oblivion in the space of 15 minutes ... For decades, this was the punchline for every bad movie joke, the bad sequel to end all bad sequels. This is a film that wishes it could be as good as ''[[Santa Claus Conquers the Martians|Santa Claus Conquers The Martians]]''.\u00bb<ref name=denofgeek/> Giving the film a score of 2 out of 10, [[IGN]]'s review of the ''Highlander 2: Renegade Version'' said: \"How bad is this movie? Well, imagine if [[Ed Wood]] were alive today, and someone gave him a multi-million dollar budget.
