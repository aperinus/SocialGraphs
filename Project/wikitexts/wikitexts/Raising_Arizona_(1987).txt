It stars [[Nicolas Cage]] as H.I. \"Hi\" McDunnough, an ex-convict, and [[Holly Hunter]] as Edwina \"Ed\" McDunnough, a former police officer and his wife. Other members of the cast include [[Trey Wilson]], [[William Forsythe (actor)|William Forsythe]], [[John Goodman]], [[Frances McDormand]], [[Sam McMurray]], and [[Randall \"Tex\" Cobb]].\n\nThe Coen brothers set out to work on the film with the intention of making a film as different from their previous film, the dark thriller ''[[Blood Simple]]'', as possible, with a lighter sense of humor and a faster pace.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Chapman King |first=Lynnea |title=The Coen Brothers Encyclopedia |publisher=Rowman & Littlefield |year=2014 |page=163 |isbn=978-0810885769}}</ref> ''Raising Arizona'' received mixed reviews at the time of its release. Some criticized it as too self-conscious, manneristic, and unclear as to whether it was fantasy or realism. Other critics praised the film for its originality.<ref>{{cite book |last=Adams |first=Jeffrey |title=The Cinema of the Coen Brothers: Hard Boiled Entertainments |year=2015 |location=New York City |publisher=Columbia University Press |pages=32\u201333 |isbn=0231174616}}</ref>\n\nThe film ranks 31st on the [[American Film Institute]]'s [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Laughs|100 Years...100 Laughs]] list, and 45th on [[Bravo (US TV channel)|Bravo's]] \"100 Funniest Movies\" list. ''Raising Arizona'' was released in the United States on March 13, 1987.\n\n==Plot==\nConvenience store robber H.I. \"Hi\" McDunnough meets police officer Edwina (\"Ed\") as she takes his [[mugshot]]s before one of [[Recidivism|multiple sentences]] in prison. During a later stay, Hi learns that Ed's [[fianc\u00e9]] has left her and proposes after being released. They marry and move into a desert [[mobile home]], and Hi gets a job in a machine shop. They want to have children, but Ed is [[Infertility|infertile]] and they cannot adopt due to Hi's criminal record.\n\nHi and Ed learn of the [[Multiple birth#Quintuplets|quintuplet]] sons known as the \"[[Arizona]] Quints\" born to regionally famous furniture magnate Nathan Arizona. They kidnap one of the babies, whom they believe to be Nathan Jr. Upon returning home, Hi's old cellmates Gale and Evelle Snoats arrive after escaping from prison. They convince Hi to shelter them and tempt him to return to his former life of crime. That night, Hi has an intense nightmare of monstrous biker Leonard Smalls.\n\nHi's [[Construction foreman|foreman]] Glen and his large and unruly family visit on the next day. When Glen suggests that he and Hi exchange wives, Hi punches Glen in the face. That night, Hi succumbs to the temptation to rob a convenience store while buying baby diapers, leading to a chase with police and a pack of dogs that he manages to outrun. As Ed and Nathan Jr. sleep, Hi decides to leave his family to join Gale and Evelle in a bank robbery. Glen returns the next morning to fire Hi, revealing his inference that Hi and Ed kidnapped Nathan Jr. Glen threatens to turn them in unless they agree to give him and his wife custody of the child. Gale and Evelle overhear this conversation and, following a conflict with Hi, kidnap Nathan Jr. themselves. Once freed from bondage, Hi joins with a despondent Ed to rescue the baby. Meanwhile, Leonard Smalls approaches Nathan Arizona and offers to return his son for $50,000, but indicates his plan to sell the baby on the [[black market]] when Nathan Sr. refuses to pay.\n\nGale and Evelle grow attached to Nathan Jr. After nearly leaving him behind at a robbed convenience store, the two promise never to give him up. But they again leave Nathan Jr. behind during the bank robbery, allowing Smalls to capture the baby before Hi and Ed arrive. In the ensuing struggle, Ed grabs Nathan Jr. while Hi occupies Smalls. Despite being severely beaten, Hi ultimately manages to kill Smalls by detonating one of the [[hand grenades]] on Smalls's jacket.\n\nRemorseful, Hi and Ed sneak into the Arizona home to return Nathan Jr. but are caught by Nathan Sr. Upon learning the reason for the kidnapping, Nathan Sr. sympathizes and decides not to turn them in.  When he hears that Hi and Ed plan to split, Nathan Sr. advises them to \"sleep on it\".\n\nIn the final scene, Hi sleeps beside Ed and has a series of prophetic dreams: Gale and Evelle willingly return to prison upon realizing they aren't ready to return to society, Glen is ticketed by a Polish-American police officer following \"one Polack joke too many\", and Nathan Jr. becomes a football star after receiving a football as a Christmas present from \"a kindly couple who wish to remain unknown\". The dream ends as an elderly couple (implied to be Hi and Ed) enjoy a holiday visit from a large family of children and grandchildren. Hi reflects on the reality of this dream and his conviction that he and Ed have the ability to be good and raise a good family, \"if not in Arizona, then somewhere close...maybe it was Utah.\"\n\n==Cast==\n<!-- Cast and order per opening tombstone credits, plus the title character, roles per closing credits scroll -->\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Nicolas Cage]] as Herbert I.

When he arrived on-set, and at various other points during production, Cage offered suggestions to the Coen brothers, which they ignored.

They have an autocratic nature.\"{{sfnp|Levine|2000|p=54}} Randall \"Tex\" Cobb also gave the Coens difficulty on set, with Joel noting that \"he's less an actor than a force of nature ...
