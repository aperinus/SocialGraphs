The sequel to ''[[Before Sunrise]]'' (1995) and the second installment in the [[Before trilogy|''Before'' trilogy]], ''Before Sunset'' follows Jesse (Hawke) and C\u00e9line (Delpy) as they reunite nine years later in [[Paris]].\n\nLinklater, Krizan,<ref name=\"youtube\">{{cite web|author=Popcorn Talk|title=BEFORE SUNSET Writer Kim Krizan & The Life of Ana\u00efs Nin \u2013 The Film Scene with Illeana Douglas|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uvOSiSIQ4XM|date=October 10, 2019|access-date=October 4, 2021|via=[[YouTube]]}}</ref> Hawke and Delpy began developing a larger budget sequel after the release of ''Before Sunrise'', but failed to secure funding. After a period of independent work, notably inspired by Hawke's divorce from [[Uma Thurman]], the writers came together in 2003 and incorporated elements of their screenplays, as well as scenes written during development of ''Before Sunrise'', to create the film's screenplay. [[Principal photography]] took place entirely in Paris, and the film is considered to take place in [[Real time (media)|real time]]. Delpy also contributed original music to the film's soundtrack.\n\n''Before Sunset'' premiered at the [[54th Berlin International Film Festival|Berlin International Film Festival]] on February 10, 2004, and was theatrically released in the United States on July 2, 2004. It grossed $16 million against a $2\u20132.7 million budget and received widespread critical acclaim, particularly for Linklater's direction, the performances and chemistry of its leads, and its screenplay. It received numerous accolades, being nominated for the [[Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Adapted Screenplay]], and appeared on many publications' lists of the best films of the year, some even calling it one of the best of the decade. It was followed by a third film, ''[[Before Midnight]]'', in 2013.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for featured films should be set between 400-700 words. -->\n\nNine years after meeting C\u00e9line in Vienna,{{refn|group=N|As depicted in ''[[Before Sunrise]]'' (1995)}} Jesse has written a bestselling novel, ''This Time'', based on their time together. During a book tour in Europe, he does a reading at [[Shakespeare and Company (bookstore)|Shakespeare and Company]], where three journalists interview him: one is convinced the novel's characters meet again, another that they do not, and a third who wants them to but is doubtful that will occur. C\u00e9line also attends the reading.\n\nRequired to leave for the airport in an hour, Jesse and C\u00e9line use the time to roam Paris. Their conversations soon become deeply personal, and they passionately discuss work, politics and lament their failure to meet again in Vienna or exchange contact details. C\u00e9line informs she did not return as her grandmother died, and Jesse claims that he did not return either; after C\u00e9line asks him why he did not, he confesses that he did return.\n\nThey reveal how their lives have changed in the nine years apart: Jesse is married and has a son named Hank, while C\u00e9line has become an environmental activist and is in a relationship with a photojournalist. They each express dissatisfaction with their lives as they walk around Paris, and their old romantic feelings are slowly rekindled. Jesse says his novel was inspired by the hope of seeing C\u00e9line again, and she says that reading it caused painful memories.\n\nC\u00e9line and Jesse arrive at her apartment, even after continuous insistence that Jesse should not miss his flight. Jesse persuades her to play a waltz on her guitar, which she wrote about their encounter in Vienna. Jesse plays [[Nina Simone]]'s \"[[Just in Time (song)|Just in Time]]\" on her stereo, which C\u00e9line dances to as he watches, the pair acknowledging he will miss his flight.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Ethan Hawke]] as Jesse\n* [[Julie Delpy]] as C\u00e9line\n* [[Vernon Dobtcheff]] as Bookstore Manager\n* Louise Lemoine Torres as Journalist #1\n* Rodolphe Pauly as Journalist #2\n* Mariane Plasteig as Waitress\n* Diabolo as Philippe\n* Denis Evrard as Boat Attendant\n* [[Albert Delpy]] (Julie Delpy's father) as Man at Grill\n* Marie Pillet (Julie Delpy's mother) as Woman in Courtyard\n}}\n\n==Production==\nAfter the filming of ''Before Sunrise'', Linklater, Krizan,<ref name=\"youtube\"/> Hawke, and Delpy discussed making a sequel.

Other locations include their walking through the [[Le Marais|Marais]] district of the [[4th arrondissement of Paris|4th arrondissement]], Le Pure Caf\u00e9 in the [[11th arrondissement of Paris|11th arrondissement]], the [[Promenade Plant\u00e9e]] park in the [[12th arrondissement of Paris|12th arrondissement]], on board a ''[[bateau mouche]]'' from Quai de la Tournelle to Quai Henri IV, the interior of a taxi, and finally \"C\u00e9line's apartment.\" Described in the film as located at 10 rue des Petites-\u00c9curies, it was filmed in Cour de l'\u00c9toile d'Or off rue du Faubourg St-Antoine.\n\nThe movie was filmed in 15 days, on a budget of about US$2\u20132.7 million.<ref name=\"Filmmaker\" /><ref name=\"Marshall\">{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/3620967/Love-that-goes-with-the-flow.html |title=Love that goes with the flow |newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |last=Marshall |first=Lee |date=July 19, 2004 |access-date=August 11, 2007 |location=London}}</ref> The film is noted for its use of the [[Steadicam]] for tracking shots and its use of [[long take]]s; the longest of the Steadicam takes lasts about 11 minutes.<ref name=\"Marshall\"/> As [[2003 European heat wave|the summer was one of the hottest on record]], the cast and crew suffered along with the city residents, as temperatures exceeded 100 degrees F (38&nbsp;\u00b0C) for most of the production.\n\nThe film is notable for essentially taking place in real time, i.e. the time elapsed in the story is the run time of the film. In the fast-changing temperate Paris climate, this created challenges for the cinematographer [[Lee Daniel]] to match the color and intensity of the skies and ambient light from scene to scene. The scenes were mostly shot in sequence, as they were still developing the screenplay. Producer Anne Walker-McBay worked with less time and less money than she had on ''Before Sunrise'', but still brought the film in on time and on budget. The sequel was released nine years after ''Before Sunrise'', the same amount of time that has lapsed in the plot since the events of the first film.\n\nThe film was released in the wake of Hawke's divorce from [[Uma Thurman]].
