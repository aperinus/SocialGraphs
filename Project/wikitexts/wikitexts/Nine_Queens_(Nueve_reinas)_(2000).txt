It stars [[Ricardo Dar\u00edn]], [[Gast\u00f3n Pauls]], and [[Leticia Br\u00e9dice]].<ref>{{IMDb title|id=0247586|title=Nueve reinas}}.</ref> In the film, [[con artists]] Marcos (Dar\u00edn) and Juan (Pauls) unexpectedly team up to sell counterfeit rare stamps to a wealthy foreign collector.\n\n''Nueve Reinas'' was theatrically released in Argentina on August 31, 2000, by [[Buena Vista International]]. The film received praise for its screenplay, Bielinsky's direction, acting performances, and its tone; it is considered an [[Cinema of Argentina|Argentine film]] classic. ''Nueve Reinas'' was a commercial success, grossing $12.4 million worldwide.\n\n==Plot==\nIn the early hours, [[con artist]] Juan successfully [[Confidence trick#Well-known confidence tricks|scams]] a cashier at a [[convenience store]], but is apprehened by the staff as he attempts the same scam on a different cashier. Fellow con artist Marcos feigns being a police officer and takes Juan away from the store. He requests Juan be his partner for the day, as his has recently disappeared. Although reluctant, Juan agrees because his father, also a con man, is in jail and requires $70,000 to bribe a judge at his hearing.\n\nLater that day, the pair are presented an elaborate and lucrative [[Confidence trick|scheme]] when Sandler, Marcos' elderly former associate, contacts him to help sell the \"Nine Queens\", a [[counterfeit]] sheet of rare [[Postage stamp|stamps]], to Vidal Gandolfo, a rich Spanish collector staying at the hotel where Marcos' sister, Valeria, works. Vidal will be deportated from Argenina the following day due to corruption charges.\n\nLacking sufficient time to properly authenticate the stamps, Vidal hires an expert who confirms their validity. Vidal offers $450,000 for the stamps, with the exchange to take place that evening. Outside the hotel, the expert tells Marcos and Juan he knew the stamps were forged and demands payment. The fake stamps are then stolen out of Juan and Marcos' hands by thieves on a motorcycle who, unaware of their value, toss them into a river.\n\nTo salvage the scheme, Marcos and Juan approach Sandler's widowed sister Berta; her deceased husband owned the real stamps. She agrees to sell for $250,000. Marcos says he can put up $200,000 and asks Juan to contribute the remaining $50,000, but Juan becomes suspicious of Marcos since it is the exact amount of money he saved so far. After visiting his father in jail, he ultimately agrees to the arrangement and the pair buy the real stamps.\n\nMarcos and Juan return to the hotel to meet Vidal. After finding out Valeria is Marcos' sister, Vidal says he will now only buy the stamps if he is able to have sex with Valeria. Valeria agrees, but says her price for doing so is for Marcos to confess to their younger brother, Federico, that Marcos cheated both Valeria and Federico out of their family inheritance. After he does so, Valeria spends the night with Vidal.\n\nThe next morning, Valeria informs them that Vidal paid for the stamps with a [[certified check]]. On their way to the bank, an attempted mugging is revealed to be an attempted con by Marcos to cheat Juan out of his share; Juan reveals he hid the check and will hand it to Marcos as they reach the bank. Upon arrival, they see a crowd outside and learn the bank has [[bank failure|crashed]] due to fraud by the management, making the check worthless. Juan, looking disillusioned, walks away, while Marcos sticks around to see if he can find a way to still get the money.\n\nJuan arrives at a warehouse, where he greets the motorcycle thieves, Vidal, Sandler, Berta, and Valeria, who is Juan's girlfriend \u2013 revealing that the real con was to swindle Marcos out of $200,000, as revenge for all the times he cheated his family and his partners.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Ricardo Dar\u00edn]] as Marcos <br /> An experienced con artist who leads a scam against Vidal Gandolfo with Juan.\n* [[Gast\u00f3n Pauls]] as Juan <br /> A con artist who unexpectedly partners with Marcos.\n* [[Leticia Br\u00e9dice]] as Valeria <br /> Marcos and Federico's sister and a hotel employee who is embroiled in a legal battle against Marcos for rights to their family inheritance.\n\nThe cast is rounded out with [[Ignasi Abadal]] as Vidal Gandolfo, a rich, corrupt Spanish stamp collector.
