The film was featured on ''[[Mystery Science Theater 3000]]''. This film is loosely based on Jules Verne's 1864 novel ''[[Journey to the Center of the Earth]]'' with some minor allusions to ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]''.\n\n==Plot==\nWanda Saknussemm ([[Kathy Ireland]]) is a nerdy social misfit with large glasses and an unusually squeaky voice who lives in [[Los Angeles]] and works at a diner. After being dumped by her boyfriend for \"not having a sense of adventure\", Wanda is informed by a letter that her father, an [[archaeologist]], fell into a bottomless pit and died. She flies to Zamboanga [[North Africa]] (\"Deepest Africa\" says the envelope's return address) and while going through her father's belongings, she finds his notes about Atlantis, apparently an alien ship that crashed millennia ago and sank into the center of the Earth. Wanda comes across a chamber beneath her father's apartment and accidentally sets off a chain of events that ultimately cause her to fall into a deep hole.\n\nAn unharmed Wanda wakes up deep within the Earth to find Gus ([[William R. Moses]]), a miner whom she protects from being slain by two people. Gus agrees to help Wanda find her father, whom she believes is alive and trapped underground. Wanda soon discovers that both she and her father are believed to be spies planning an invasion of Atlantis. People from the surface world are referred to as \"aliens\" by Atlanteans, who appear virtually identical to surface dwellers, and when Wanda is overheard talking about [[Malibu Beach]] by a low-life informant (Janie Du Plessis), she soon becomes a hunted woman and must dodge efforts at capture, both from the mysterious \"Government House\" and from thugs in the pay of the crime lord Mambino ([[Deep Roy]]).\n\nWanda's efforts at escape are aided by Charmin' ([[Thom Mathews]]), a handsome rogue who (briefly) assists her flight and falls for Wanda. She is ultimately captured by the evil General Pykov (Du Plessis again), who wants to kill both Wanda and her incarcerated father. Before the Atlantean leader can decide what to do with Wanda and her father, Gus shows up and helps the duo escape while fighting off General Pykov and her soldiers. Wanda and her father board a ship that takes them back to the surface and the film ends with Wanda on the beach, wearing a bikini and a sarong. She refuses the advances of her ex-boyfriend and is soon reunited with Charmin', who inexplicably appears on a motorcycle.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Kathy Ireland]] as Wanda Saknussemm\n* [[William R.

According to director [[Albert Pyun]], Ireland was cast for her tall stature, as he wanted to illustrate a physical difference between people from the surface and people who were closer to the Earth's center.<ref>{{Cite AV media|author=Shout!
