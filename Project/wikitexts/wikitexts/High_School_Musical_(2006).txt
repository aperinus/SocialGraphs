The two are called upon to sing a duet together for [[karaoke]] (\"Start of Something New\"). Returning to school after the break, Troy sees Gabriella in his homeroom. She explains that she has just moved to [[Albuquerque, New Mexico]], and transferred to East High School over the break. As Troy shows Gabriella around the school, drama club president [[Sharpay Evans]] assumes that Gabriella is interested in auditioning for the school musical. Wanting to eliminate the competition, Sharpay discovers Gabriella's past academic achievements, and anonymously informs scholastic decathlon captain [[Taylor McKessie]] of them, so she will recruit Gabriella for the team. Taylor and Gabriella become friends over their shared interests.\n\nDuring a basketball practice, Troy is distracted by thoughts of Gabriella and the idea that he might enjoy singing in addition to basketball (\"Get'cha Head in the Game\"). Gabriella and Troy go to the musical auditions where Sharpay and her twin brother [[List of High School Musical characters#Ryan Evans|Ryan Evans]] perform \"[[What I've Been Looking For]]\". However, Troy and Gabriella are hesitant to audition. When Gabriella gains the confidence to step forward once the auditions are unofficially declared \"over\", Troy offers to sing with her. However, drama teacher Ms. Darbus tells them they are too late and leaves. Kelsi Nielsen, the musical's composer, drops her music sheets on the stage; Troy and Gabriella rush to help her and sing the same song together. Overhearing their performance, Ms. Darbus gives them a callback audition.\n\nWhen the callback list gets posted, Sharpay is furious that she has competition for the lead role, while the Wildcats basketball team is shocked that Troy has auditioned. After finding out that Troy can do activities outside his clique, other students confess their secret passions and talents (\"[[Stick to the Status Quo]]\"). This alarms Taylor and Troy's best friend [[Chad Danforth]]. Taylor and Chad come up with a plan to divert Troy and Gabriella from singing in the musical so they can focus on their upcoming competitions.\n\nIn the locker room, Troy is tricked by his teammates into saying that Gabriella and the audition is not needed. Gabriella watches this via a hidden webcam that the scholastic decathlon team has set up. Upset by Troy's perceived betrayal (\"When There Was Me and You\"), Gabriella decides to not audition for the musical. Troy, confused by Gabriella's decision, is unable to concentrate on the game, while Gabriella is low in spirits. Realizing their mistake, Chad and the basketball team tell Troy what happened and offer to support him in the callbacks. Taylor also explains to Gabriella that she was wrong but Gabriella dismisses this, believing Troy meant what he said. That evening, Troy goes to Gabriella's house where he explains the truth and they reconcile, determined to audition for the musical.\n\nOverhearing Gabriella and Troy rehearse, Sharpay asks Ms. Darbus to move the callbacks so they start at the same time as both Troy's championship game and Gabriella's scholastic decathlon competition. Kelsi overhears the conversation, and both the basketball and decathlon teams make a plan together. On the day of the competitions, Taylor and Gabriella use the school's computers to delay the championship game by hacking the power in the gym and causing a chemical reaction that forces an evacuation during the decathlon. Troy and Gabriella rush to the auditorium as Sharpay and Ryan finish their callback song (\"Bop to the Top\"). After Gabriella and Troy successfully perform their song \"[[Breaking Free]]\", Ms. Darbus gives them the lead roles, making Sharpay and Ryan [[Understudy|understudies]]. Both teams win their respective competitions, and the entire school gathers in the gym to celebrate (\"[[We're All in This Together (High School Musical song)|We're All in This Together]]\"). Chad asks Taylor out, and Sharpay makes peace with Gabriella.\n\nIn a [[post-credits scene]], Zeke Baylor paces alone in the gym, when Sharpay runs in, declaring that the cookies he had given her that she had initially rejected are \"genius\". She hugs him, and he says he will make her a [[cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e]]. Zeke smiles in victory.\n\n==Cast==\n{{main|List of High School Musical characters}}\n<!---Keep cast list in order of on-screen credits-->\n* [[Zac Efron]] as Troy Bolton, one of the most popular students at East High School and the captain of the [[varsity team|varsity]] [[basketball]] team.
