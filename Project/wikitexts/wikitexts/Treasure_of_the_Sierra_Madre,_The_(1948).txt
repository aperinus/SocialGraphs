It is an adaptation of [[B. Traven]]'s 1927 [[The Treasure of the Sierra Madre|novel of the same name]], set in 1925, and follows two downtrodden men (played by [[Humphrey Bogart]] and [[Tim Holt]]) who join forces with a grizzled old prospector\n([[Walter Huston]], the director's father), in searching for gold in [[Mexico]].\n\n''The Treasure of the Sierra Madre'' was one of the first Hollywood productions to be shot [[Filming location|on location]] outside the United States (in the state of [[Durango]] with street scenes in [[Tampico]], Mexico), although many scenes were filmed back in the studio and elsewhere in the U.S. In 1990, the film was selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".<ref name=\"1990Add\">{{cite news|last=Gamarekian|first=Barbara|title=Library of Congress Adds 25 Titles to National Film Registry|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/10/19/movies/library-of-congress-adds-25-titles-to-national-film-registry.html|date=October 19, 1990|access-date=July 22, 2009}}</ref>\n\n== Plot ==\nIn 1925, in the Mexican town of [[Tampico]], labor contractor Pat McCormick recruits Fred C. Dobbs and Bob Curtin, two broke American drifters, as [[roughneck]]s to help construct oil rigs for $8 a day. When the project is completed and the men return to Tampico, McCormick skips out without paying them.\n\nThe two vagrants encounter an old man named Howard in a [[flophouse]]. A loquacious ex-miner, he talks to them about gold prospecting and the perils of striking it rich. Dobbs and Curtin run into McCormick at a cantina, and collect their back wages after a bar fight. When Dobbs hits a small jackpot in the lottery, he, Curtin and Howard have enough money to buy supplies to go prospecting in the interior.\n\nDeparting Tampico by train, the three help repulse a bandit attack led by \"Gold Hat\". North of [[Durango]], the trio head into the remote [[Sierra Madre Occidental|Sierra Madre mountains]]. Howard proves to be the hardiest and most knowledgeable of the three. After several days of arduous travel, he spots gold the others had missed.\n\nThe men toil under harsh conditions and amass a fortune in [[Placer mining|placer gold]]. But as the gold piles up, Dobbs becomes increasingly distrustful of the other two. The men agree to divide the gold dust immediately and hide their shares.\n\nOn a resupply trip to Durango, Curtin is spotted making purchases by a Texan named Cody. Cody secretly follows Curtin back to the encampment. When he confronts the three men, they lie about what they are doing there, but he is not fooled. He boldly proposes to join their outfit and share in any future takings. Howard, Curtin and Dobbs discuss it and vote to kill him. As they announce their verdict, pistols in hand, Gold Hat and his bandits arrive. They claim to be [[Federal Police (Mexico)|''Federales'']]. After a tense parley, a gunfight ensues, and Cody is killed. A genuine troop of ''Federales'' suddenly appears and pursues Gold Hat and his gang. The three prospectors examine Cody's personal effects. A letter from a loving wife reveals that he was trying to provide for his family. Moved by the letter, Howard and Curtin agree to give part of their share to Cody's family, though Dobbs declines to do the same.\n\nHoward is called away to assist local villagers with a seriously ill little boy. When the boy recovers, the next day, the villagers insist that Howard return with them to be honored. Howard leaves his goods with Dobbs and Curtin and says he will meet them later. Dobbs and Curtin constantly argue, until one night Dobbs shoots Curtin and takes all the gold. But Curtin is not dead, and manages to crawl away and hide during the night.\n\nFinding Curtin gone, Dobbs flees, but is ambushed at a waterhole by Gold Hat and his men. They first toy with him, then kill him. The bandits mistake the bags of gold dust for sand and dump them, taking only the burros and supplies. The gold is scattered by the strong wind. Meanwhile, Curtin is discovered by [[Indigenous peoples of Mexico|''indios'']] and taken to Howard's village, where he recovers.\n\nGold Hat's gang tries to sell the stolen burros in town, but a child recognizes the brands on them (and Dobbs's clothes, which the bandits are wearing) and reports them to the authorities. The bandits are captured and summarily executed by the ''Federales''.\n\nHoward and Curtin return to Durango in a dust storm hoping to reclaim their gold, only to find empty bags. At first shaken by the loss, first Howard, then Curtin, grasp the immense [[irony]] of their circumstances, and burst into laughter. Howard decides to return to the village to accept an offer of a permanent home and a position of honor, while Curtin sells their recovered property to return to the U.S., where he will seek out Cody's widow. As Curtin leaves, the camera pans down to a cactus as he rides past. Lying next to it is another empty bag.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Humphrey Bogart]] as Fred C.

Traven]] in 1935 and thought the material would make a great movie with his father in the main role. Based on a 19th-century ballad by a German poet, Traven's book reminded Huston of his adventures in the Mexican cavalry. After a smashing success with his directorial debut, ''[[The Maltese Falcon (1941 film)|The Maltese Falcon]]'', Huston started to work on the project. The studio had [[George Raft]], [[Edward G. Robinson]], and [[John Garfield]] in mind for the three main roles, but then World War II intervened.\n\n[[Vincent Sherman]] was set to direct a version of the story during the World War II years until his script fell afoul of the 1930 [[Motion Picture Production Code]] for being derogatory toward Mexicans.\n\n===Casting===\nBy the time Huston came back from making several documentaries for the war effort, Humphrey Bogart had become Warner Brothers' biggest star. When Bogart first got wind that Huston might be making a film of the novel, he immediately started badgering Huston for a part. Bogart was given the main role of Fred C. Dobbs. Before filming, Bogart encountered a critic while leaving a New York nightclub. \"Wait till you see me in my next picture\", he said. \"I play the worst shit you ever saw\".\n[[File:Walter Huston in The Treasure of the Sierra Madre trailer.jpg|right|thumb|upright|[[Walter Huston]] as Howard]]\nTraven initially disagreed with Huston's decision to cast his father, Walter Huston, as Howard, preferring [[Lewis Stone]], but eventually came to agree with Huston. Walter Huston also questioned his son's choice.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} He still saw himself as a leading man and was not keen on being cast in a supporting role. His son was able to convince him to accept. John Huston rated his father's performance as the finest piece of acting in any of his films.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} On seeing Walter Huston's performance, Bogart famously said, \"One Huston is bad enough, but two are murder\".\n\nHuston originally wanted to cast [[Ronald Reagan]] as James Cody. [[Jack L. Warner]] instead insisted on casting Reagan in another film. Bruce Bennett was eventually cast in the role. A few notable uncredited actors appear in the film. In an opening cameo, John Huston is pestered for money by Bogart's character, directed by Bogart. [[Robert Blake (actor)|Robert Blake]] also appears as a young boy selling lottery tickets.<ref name=\"Maltin\">{{cite book |last=Maltin |first=Leonard |author-link=Leonard Maltin |title=Leonard Maltin's 2015 Movie Guide |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=F60TAwAAQBAJ&pg=PT2447 |year=2014 |publisher=Penguin Group US |isbn=978-0-14-218176-8 |page=2,447}}</ref>\n\nA photograph included in the documentary accompanying the DVD release shows [[Ann Sheridan]] in streetwalker costume, with Bogart and Huston on the set.<ref>''Discovering Treasure: The Story of The Treasure of the Sierra Madre'', Turner Classic Movies, 2003</ref> Many film-history sources credit Sheridan for a part.

The opening scenes, filmed in longshot on the Plaza de la Libertad in Tampico, show contemporary (1940s) cars and buses, even though the story opens in 1925, as evidenced by the lottery number's poster.\n\nJust as Huston was starting to shoot scenes in Tampico, the local government inexplicably shut the production down. The cast and crew were at a complete loss to understand, since Tampico's residents and government had so far been generous. It turned out that a local newspaper had printed a false story accusing the film of being unflattering to Mexico.\n\nHuston soon found out why the newspaper skewered his production. When you wanted to do anything in Tampico, it was customary to bribe the editor of the newspaper, which the crew had failed to do. Fortunately, two of Huston's associates, [[Diego Rivera]] and [[Miguel Covarrubias]], went to bat for the director with the president of Mexico. The libelous accusations were dropped, and a few weeks later, the editor of the newspaper was caught ''[[in flagrante delicto|in flagrante]]'' and shot dead by a jealous husband.\n\nMost of the Mexican extras were paid 10 pesos a day, the equivalent of $2, a considerable amount for an impoverished region at the time.\n\nThere were scenes in which Walter Huston had to speak fluent Spanish, a language he did not know. John Huston hired a Mexican to record the lines and then the elder Huston memorized them so well that many thought he knew the language. As with most of the Mexican actors selected from the local population, [[Alfonso Bedoya]]'s heavily accented pronunciation of English proved a bit of a problem (\"horseback\" sounded like \"whore's back\"). Bogart knew only two Spanish words, \"Dos Equis\", a Mexican beer.\n\nThe fight scene in the cantina took five days to shoot. During the shooting of the entire film, John Huston pulled pranks on Bennett, Bedoya (along with Bogart), and Bogart. While most of the film was shot in Mexico, Jack L. Warner had the unit return to Hollywood when the budget started to exceed three million dollars.\n\nThough the [[dailies]] impressed Warner Bros., Jack L. Warner nearly went berserk with the weekly expenditures. After viewing one scene, Warner threw up his hands and shouted to producer Henry Blanke, \"Yeah, they're looking for gold all right\u2014mine!\" During another screening of dailies, Warner watched Dobbs stumble along in the desert for water. Warner jumped up in the middle of the scene and shouted to a gaggle of executives, \"If that s.o.b. doesn't find water soon I'll go broke!\".\n\nWarner had reason to be upset. John Huston and Blanke led him to believe that the film would be an easy picture to make and that they would be in and out of Mexico in a matter of weeks. Warner was notorious for not actually reading scripts and had assumed the film was a B-movie Western. As the full extent of Huston's plans became apparent, Warner became quite angry. He was especially unhappy with the way the film ended, arguing that audiences wouldn't accept it. The initial box office take was indeed unimpressive, but the film was a huge critical success and more than earned back its original investment of $3 million in its many rereleases.\n\nAs production dragged on, Bogart, an avid yachtsman, was getting increasingly anxious about missing the [[Transpacific Yacht Race|Honolulu Race]] in which he usually took part. Despite assurances from the studio that his work would be done by then, he started to pester Huston about finishing in time. Eventually, Huston had enough, grabbed Bogart by the nose, and twisted hard. Bogart never again asked him to confirm when shooting was expected to be over.\n\nThe wind storm in the final scene was created by jet engines borrowed from the [[Mexican Air Force]].\n\n===Edited scene===\nHuston's original filmed depiction{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} of Dobbs's death was more graphic\u2014as it was in the book\u2014than the one that made it onto the screen. When Gold Hat strikes Dobbs with his machete, Dobbs is decapitated. Huston shot Dobbs's (fake) head rolling into the waterhole (a quick shot of Gold Hat's accomplices reacting to Dobbs's rolling head remains in the film, and in the very next shot one can see the water rippling where it rolled in). The 1948 censors would not allow that, so Huston camouflaged the cut shot with a repeat shot of Gold Hat striking Dobbs. Warner Bros.' publicity department released a statement that Bogart was \"disappointed the scene couldn't be shown in all its graphic glory.\"{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} Bogart's reaction was: \"What's wrong with showing a guy getting his head cut off?\"{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\n===John Huston's screenplay===\n{{main|Stinking badges}}\n\nJohn Huston's adaptation of Traven's novel was altered to meet [[Hays Code]] regulations, which severely limited profanity in film.<ref name=\"classicfilmguide\">{{cite web |url=http://www.classicfilmguide.com/indexa620.html |title=Treasure of the Sierra Madre, The (1948) |access-date=2010-04-21 |year=2010 |publisher=classicfilmguide.com}}</ref> The original line from the novel was:\n\n:\"Badges, to god-damned hell with badges!

There has been controversy since the 1949 ceremony because of the academy's choice not to nominate Bogart for the [[Academy Award for Best Actor]], a choice that modern critics and [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences|Academy]] members have since condemned. Bogart's performance has been named the best of his career.

At the end of the expansion, the player finds the gold but is forced to leave almost all of it behind, as it's too heavy to carry while they escape.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Noteslist}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n* {{cite book|last=Baxter|first=John|title=Stanley Kubrick: A Biography|year=1997|publisher=HarperCollins|isbn=978-0-00-638445-8}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons category|The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (film)}}\n{{wikiquote}}\n* {{IMDb title}}\n* {{AllMovie title}}\n* {{TCMDb title}}\n* {{AFI film}}\n* {{Rotten Tomatoes}}\n* {{Mojo title}}\n* [http://www.virtual-history.com/movie/film/1112/the-treasure-of-the-sierra-madre Literature on ''The Treasure of the Sierra Madre'']\n* [https://archive.org/details/Luxradiotheater49-04-18TreasureOfTheSierraMadre ''The Treasure of the Sierra Madre''] on [[Lux Radio Theater]]: April 18, 1949\n\n{{John Huston}}\n{{Navboxes\n| title = Awards for ''The Treasure of the Sierra Madre''\n| list =\n{{Golden Globe Award Best Motion Picture Drama}}\n{{New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Film}}\n}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Treasure Of The Sierra Madre, The}}\n[[Category:1948 films]]\n[[Category:1940s adventure drama films]]\n[[Category:1948 Western (genre) films]]\n[[Category:American adventure drama films]]\n[[Category:American black-and-white films]]\n[[Category:American Western (genre) films]]\n[[Category:Best Drama Picture Golden Globe winners]]\n[[Category:1940s English-language films]]\n[[Category:Films about capital punishment]]\n[[Category:Films based on German novels]]\n[[Category:Films based on works by B.
