It is a direct [[sequel]] to ''[[Jaws 2]]'', [[Retroactive continuity|ignoring the events of]] ''[[Jaws 3-D]]'', and is the fourth and final film in the [[Jaws (franchise)|franchise]]. [[Lorraine Gary]] reprised her role from the first two films while new cast members include [[Lance Guest]], [[Mario Van Peebles]], [[Karen Young (actress)|Karen Young]] and [[Michael Caine]]. In addition, it is the final film appearance for [[Judith Barsi]] before she was murdered a year later.\n\nThe film focuses on a now-widowed Ellen Brody (Lorraine Gary) after Chief Brody died from a heart attack, her conviction that a [[great white shark]] is seeking revenge on her family, particularly when it kills her son, and follows her to [[the Bahamas]]. ''Jaws: The Revenge'' was shot on location in New England and in the Bahamas, and completed on the Universal lot. As with the first two films, [[Martha's Vineyard]] was the location of the fictional Amity Island for the opening scenes.\n\nWhile production of the other three films in the series took around two years each, ''Jaws: The Revenge'' was made in less than nine months. According to associate producer and production manager Frank Baur during the sequel's filming, \"This (''Revenge'') will be the fastest I have ever seen a major film planned and executed in all of my 35 years as a production manager.\"<ref name=\"Jaws Revenge 1987.

Martin's widow, Ellen, still lives in Amity, close to her younger son, Sean, and his fianc\u00e9e, Tiffany. Sean works as a police deputy. When he is dispatched to clear a log from a buoy a few days before Christmas, a [[great white shark]] appears and tears off his arm. He screams for help, but the singing on land drowns out his cries. The shark sinks his boat and drags him underwater to his death.\n\nMartin's older son, Michael, his wife, Carla, and their five-year-old daughter, Thea, come to Amity for the funeral. Michael is working in the Bahamas as a marine biologist and on his arrival, Ellen demands that he stop his work. Having just received his first grant, Michael is reluctant. Thea convinces Ellen to return to the Bahamas with them.\n\nThe pilot of their small plane, Hoagie, takes an interest in Ellen when he flies them back. Wanting to take her mind off her recent losses and finding herself attracted, she begins spending time with him. Michael introduces his mother to his colleague Jake and his wife Louisa, and they spend Christmas and New Year's together.\n\nA few days later, Michael, Jake, and their crew encounter the shark, which followed the family from Amity. Jake is eager to research it because great white sharks have never been seen in the Bahamas due to the warm water. Michael asks him not to mention the shark to his family. During the day, Ellen can keep her mind off the shark, but at night she has nightmares of being attacked by it. She is also able to feel when the shark is about to attack one of her loved ones.\n\nJake decides to attach a device to the shark that can track it through its heartbeat. Using chum to attract it, Jake stabs the device's tracking pole into the shark's side. The next day, the shark ambushes and chases Michael through a sunken ship, and he narrowly escapes.\n\nThea goes on an [[Banana boat (boat)|inflatable banana boat]] with her friend Margaret and her mother. While Carla presents her new art sculpture, the shark attacks the back of the boat, killing Margaret's mother. After Thea is safe, Ellen boards Jake's boat to track down the shark, intending to kill it to save her family. After hearing about what happened, Michael confesses he knew about the shark, infuriating Carla.\n\nMichael and Jake are flown by Hoagie to search for Ellen, and find the shark in pursuit of their boat. During the search, Hoagie explains to Michael about Ellen's belief that the shark that killed Sean is hunting her family. When they find her, Hoagie lands the plane on the water, ordering Michael and Jake to swim to the boat as the shark drags the plane and Hoagie underwater.\n\nHoagie escapes from the shark, and Jake and Michael hastily put together a device that emits electrical impulses. As Jake moves to the front of the boat, the shark lunges up and mauls him. Jake manages to get the device into the shark's mouth before being dragged underwater. Michael begins blasting the shark with the impulses, which drive it mad; it repeatedly jumps out of the water, roaring in pain.\n\nMichael continues blasting the shark with the impulses, causing it to leap out of the water again. Ellen steers the sailboat towards the shark, while thinking back to the shark's attack on Thea and also imagining Sean's death - and Martin defeating the first shark. As the shark is rearing up, she rams the broken bowsprit of the boat into it. \n\nIn the original version of the film that was screened in the U.S., the shark bleeds out heavily and dies after being impaled. In the revised ending (for international theaters and DVD release), the impaling causes the shark to immediately explode and its corpse sinks to the bottom of the ocean (with re-used footage from the first film). Also in the revised ending, Michael hears Jake calling for help, seriously injured but still alive (Jake died in the original cut). A short time later, Hoagie flies Ellen back to Amity Island.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Lorraine Gary]] as Ellen Brody\n* [[Lance Guest]] as Michael Brody\n* [[Mario Van Peebles]] as Jake\n* [[Karen Young (actress)|Karen Young]] as Carla Brody\n* [[Judith Barsi]] as Thea Brody\n* [[Michael Caine]] as Hoagie Newcombe\n* [[Lynn Whitfield]] as Louisa\n* [[Mitchell Anderson]] as Sean Brody\n* [[Jay Mello]] (''archive footage'') as Young Sean\n* [[Roy Scheider]] (''archive footage/photo'') as Martin Brody\n* [[Cedric Scott]] as Clarence\n* [[Charles Bowleg]] as William\n* [[Melvin Van Peebles]] as Mr. Witherspoon\n* Mary Smith as Tiffany\n* [[Edna Billotto]] as Polly\n* [[Fritzi Jane Courtney]] as Mrs. Taft\n* [[Cyprian R.

He had worked with [[Lorraine Gary]] in 1973's ''[[The Marcus-Nelson Murders]]'', for which he won his first [[Directors Guild of America]] Award.<ref>{{cite press release |publisher=Universal Studios |year=1987 |title=Joseph Sargent \"Jaws The Revenge\" Universal News}}</ref> Indeed, [[Steven Spielberg]] cites this [[television film]], which later spawned ''[[Kojak]]'', as motivation for casting Gary as Ellen Brody in the original ''Jaws'' film, besides the fact she was the wife of the studio's chief executive [[Sidney Sheinberg]] at that time.<ref>''The Making of Jaws''. Documentary on ''Jaws'' DVD, directed by Laurent Bouzereau</ref> In regards to ''Revenge'', Gary remarked in an interview: \"I made a good deal on this film, but I didn't make as good a deal as I would have if I weren't married to Sid.\"<ref>\"The Shark That Won't Go Away\", by Donna Rosenthal. Newsday, March 22, 1987.</ref>\n\nIn an interview with the ''[[Boston Herald]]'', Sargent called ''Revenge'' \"a ticking bomb waiting to go off. ... Sid Sheinberg (president of MCA Inc., parent company of Universal Pictures) expects a miracle \u2013 and we're going to make it happen.\" Sargent got a call from Sheinberg in late September 1986, asking him to direct the fourth ''Jaws'' movie with no script yet written. Said Sargent, \"I didn't have time to laugh because Sid explained he wanted to do a quality picture about human beings. When he told me, 'It's your baby, you produce and direct,' I accepted.\" According to Sargent, Sheinberg \"cut through all the slow lanes and got ''Jaws: The Revenge'' off and running.\"<ref name=\"Jaws Revenge 1987. Pg. 31\"/> In a 2006 interview, Sargent stated that the premise was born \"out of a little bit of desperation to find something fresh to do with the shark. We thought that maybe if we take a mystical point of view, and go for a little bit of ... magic, we might be able to find something interesting enough to sit through.\"<ref>Rutkowski, Gary (March 9, 2006).

Pg. 31\"/>\n\nThe studio fast-tracked ''Jaws: The Revenge'' into production in September 1986 so that it could be released the following summer.<ref name=\"hunter\"/> The principal script by Michael Guzman, known for his TV work, was written in five weeks; however, the final shooting script had not been completed when filming began. Actors from the original film, [[Roy Scheider]], who had been proposed as the shark\u2019s first victim, and [[Richard Dreyfuss]] refused to participate.<ref name=\"hunter\"/> The film has no continuity from ''Jaws 3-D''. In its predecessor, Mike is an engineer for [[SeaWorld]], whereas in ''Jaws: The Revenge'', he is a marine research scientist.<ref name=\"jabootu\"/> One of the Universal press releases for ''Jaws: The Revenge'' refers to ''Jaws: The Revenge'' as the \"third film of the remarkable ''Jaws'' trilogy.\"<ref name=\"young\">{{cite press release |publisher=Universal Studios |year=1987 |title=Karen Young \"Jaws The Revenge\" Universal News}}</ref> The underwater chase scene between Mike and the shark in ''Revenge'' was lifted from an early screenplay draft of ''Jaws 3-D''.<ref>Jaws 3-D script, revised first draft, 8/10/82. http://www.horrorlair.com/scripts/jaws3_1st_draft.txt {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141013185817/http://www.horrorlair.com/scripts/jaws3_1st_draft.txt |date=October 13, 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Casting===\n[[Lorraine Gary]] portrayed Ellen Brody in the first two films. In a press release, Gary says ''Jaws: The Revenge''' is \"also about relationships which ... makes it much more like the first ''Jaws''.\" This was Gary's first film role since she had appeared in Spielberg's ''[[1941 (film)|1941]]'' eight years earlier, as well as being her final film role.\n\nThe press release proposes that the character \"had much more depth and texture than either of the other films was able to explore. The promise of further developing this multi-dimensional woman under the extraordinary circumstances ... intrigued Gary enough to lure her back to the screen after a lengthy hiatus.\"<ref name=\"lorraine\">{{cite press release |publisher=Universal Studios |year=1987  |title=Lorraine Gary \"Jaws The Revenge\" Universal News}}</ref> Although the film was always going to be centered on Gary, [[Roy Scheider]] was offered a cameo. If he had accepted it, it was his Martin Brody character, rather than Sean Brody, who would have been killed by the shark at the film's beginning.<ref name=\"jabootu\"/>\n\nGary is the only principal cast member from the original film who returned, although Lee Fierro made a brief cameo as Mrs. Kintner (the mother of Alex M. Kintner who was killed in ''Jaws''), as did [[Fritzi Jane Courtney]], who played Mrs. Taft, one of the Amity town council members in both ''Jaws'' and ''Jaws 2''. Cyprian R. Dube, who played Amity Selectman Mr. Posner in both ''Jaws'' and ''Jaws 2'', is upgraded to mayor following the death of [[Murray Hamilton]], who played Larry Vaughan, the mayor in the first two ''Jaws'' films.\n\nGary states that one of the reasons she was attracted to the film was the idea of an on-screen romance with [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] winner [[Michael Caine]]. Caine had previously starred in another [[Peter Benchley]]-adapted flop, ''[[The Island (1980 film)|The Island]]''.\n\n<blockquote>The first day we were to work together I was nervous as a school girl. We were shooting a [[Junkanoo|Junkanoo Festival]] with noisy drums and hundreds of extras. But he never faltered in his concentration and he put me completely at ease. It was all so natural. He's an extraordinary actor&nbsp;\u2013 and just a nice human being.<ref name=\"lorraine\"/></blockquote>\n\nCaine had mixed feelings about both the production and the final version. He thinks that it was a first for him to be involved with someone his own age in a film. He compares the relationship between two middle-aged people to the romance between two teenagers. Although disappointed not to be able to collect an Academy Award because of filming in the Bahamas, he was glad to be involved in the film. In the press release, he explains that \"it is part of movie history ... the original was one of the great all-time thrillers. I thought it might be nice to be mixed up with that. I liked the script very much.\"<ref name=\"caine\">{{cite press release |publisher=Universal Studios |year=1987 |title=Michael Caine \"Jaws The Revenge\" Universal News}}</ref> However, Caine later claimed: \"I have never seen it [the film], but by all accounts it is terrible.

[[Lynn Whitfield]] played Louisa, and stunt performer Diane Hetfield was the victim of the banana boat attack.\n\n===Filming===\n[[Principal photography]] for ''Jaws: The Revenge'' took place on location in [[New England]] and in [[the Bahamas]], and completed on the Universal lot. Like the first two films of the series, [[Martha's Vineyard]] was the location of the fictional Amity Island for the film's opening scenes. Production commenced on February 2, 1987, by which time \"snowstorms had blanketed\" the island for almost a month, \"providing a frosty backdrop for the opening scenes.\"<ref name=\"prod-press\">{{cite press release |publisher=Universal Studios |year=1987 |title=\"Jaws The Revenge\": Production Notes, Universal News}}</ref> Because the sequel had to be ready for release by July of the same year and the mechanical shark had to be filmed in warmer temperatures, Martha's Vineyard only makes a [[cameo appearance]] in ''Revenge''.\n\nIn addition to the 124 cast and crew members, 250 local extras were also hired. The majority of the extras were used as members of the local high school band, chorus and dramatic society that can be seen as the Brodys walk through the town, and during Sean's attack. A local gravestone maker produced 51 slabs for the mock graveyard used for Sean's funeral.<ref name=\"prod-press\"/>\n\nThe cast and crew moved to [[Nassau, Bahamas|Nassau]] in the Bahamas on February 9, beginning principal photography there the next day. Like the production of the first two films, they encountered many problems with varying weather conditions. The location did not offer the \"perfect world\" that the 38-day shoot required. Cover shots were filmed on shore and in interior sets.<ref name=\"prod-press\"/> The film was shot in the [[Super 35]] format.<ref>{{cite web |title=Jaws: The Revenge |work=Allmovie |url=https://allmovie.com/cg/avg.dll?p=avg&sql=1:25919 |access-date=May 31, 2007}}</ref>\n\n===Special effects===\n[[File:Jaws The Revenge - Explode.jpg|thumb|A frame from the sequence where the shark is destroyed, showing the crude shark model. Henry Millar was awarded for \"Worst Visual Effects\" at the [[1987 Golden Raspberry Awards]].]]\nThe special effects team, headed by Henry Millar, had arrived at South Beach, Nassau on January 12, 1987, almost a month before principal photography commenced there. In the official press release, Millar says that when he became involved \"we didn't even have a script ... but as the story developed and they started telling us all what they wanted ... I knew this wasn't going to be like any other shark anyone had ever seen.\"<ref name=\"prod-press\"/>\n\nThe shark was to be launched from atop an {{convert|88|ft|m|adj=on}} long platform, made from the trussed turret of a {{convert|30|ft|m|adj=on}} crane, and floated out into Clifton Bay. Seven sharks, or segments, were produced.\n\n<blockquote>Two models were fully articulated, two were made for jumping, one for ramming, one was a half shark (the top half) and one was just a fin. The two fully articulated models each had 22 sectioned ribs and movable jaws covered by a flexible water-based latex skin, measured {{convert|25|ft|m}} in length and weighed 2500 pounds. Each tooth was half-a-foot long and as sharp as it looked. All models were housed under cover ... in a secret location on the island.<ref name=\"prod-press\"/></blockquote>\n\nThe film company returned to Universal to finish shooting on April 2. Principal photography was completed in Los Angeles on May 26. Millar's special effects team, however, remained in Nassau, completing second unit photography on June 4.\n\n===Underwater sequences===\nCinematographer John McPherson also supervised the underwater unit, which was headed by Pete Romano. Whereas underwater photography was normally filmed with an anamorphic lens, requiring overhead lighting, Romano filmed these \"sequences with [[Carl Zeiss AG|Zeiss]], a 35 mm super-speed lens, which allows the natural ambiance to come through on film.\"<ref name=\"prod-press\"/> Additional underwater photography was completed in a water tank, measuring {{convert|50|ft|m}} by {{convert|100|ft|m}} across, and {{convert|17|ft|m}} in depth,  in Universal Studio's Stage 27. Also, a replica of Nassau's Clifton Bay and its skyline was created on the man-made Falls Lake on the studio backlot.<ref name=\"prod-press\"/>\n\nA television documentary, \"Behind the Scenes with ''Jaws: The Revenge''\", was broadcast in the U.S. on July 10, 1987. Twenty-two minutes in length, it was written and directed by William Rus for Zaloom Mayfield Productions.<ref>{{cite web |title=Behind the Scenes with 'Jaws: The Revenge' |work=Internet Movie Database |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0995030/combined |access-date=2007-05-31 |archive-date=March 6, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160306184955/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0995030/combined |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n===Ending changes===\nIn the original theatrical version's ending, Ellen rammed the shark with Mike's boat, mortally wounding it.

In its opening weekend, the film grossed $7,154,890, almost half of what ''Jaws 3-D'' had grossed in its first weekend. ''Jaws: The Revenge'' was only in the top 10 for two weeks, before dropping to No. 12 in its third week. By the end of its theatrical run, ''Jaws: The Revenge'' had grossed a worldwide total of $51,881,013.

These include spoken narration prior to the opening credits explaining that some circumstances can be due to fate, and more dialogue between Ellen and Hoagie as well as between Michael and Jake. There are additional shots of the shark diving towards the submersible and slightly different angles showing Jake's death.\n\nSome airings of ''Jaws: The Revenge'', most notably on the BBC, have not cropped the frames shown, meaning that most of the shark's internal machinery on its underside is visible during attack sequences.\n\n===Home media===\n''Jaws: The Revenge'' was the first film of the series to be released on [[DVD]].

The soundtrack was presented in [[Dolby Digital]] 4.1, with one reviewer saying that the \"stereo separation is great with ocean waves swirling around you, the bubbles going by during the scuba scenes, and Hoagie's airplane flying around behind you.\" The same reviewer praised the image transfer of McPherson's \"extremely well photographed\" cinematography.<ref>{{cite web |last=Messenger |first=Neil |title=JAWS THE REVENGE |work=dvdcult.com |url=http://www.dvdcult.com/rev_Jaws4.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060926104158/http://www.dvdcult.com/rev_Jaws4.htm |archive-date=September 26, 2006 |access-date=June 1, 2007}}</ref> The film was re-released on DVD by [[Universal Pictures|Universal]] on June 3, 2003, in an anamorphic transfer.

While Searls' ''Jaws 2'' novelization was based on an earlier draft of that film and was significantly different from the finished film, his ''Jaws: The Revenge'' novelization sticks fairly close to the final film, although it does contain some extra subplots. The novel contains a subplot in which Hoagie is a government agent and he transports laundered money. The only reference to this in the film is when Michael Brody asks \"What do you do when you're not flying people?\" to which Hoagie replies, \"I deliver laundry.\" In Searls' novel, the character of Jake is ultimately killed by the shark; Jake was originally supposed to die in the film, but the script was changed to allow him to survive.<ref>{{cite web |title=Hank Searls Writers Workshops |url=http://critiquemaster.com/ |access-date=2007-02-11 |archive-date=September 30, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930121009/http://critiquemaster.com/ |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe novelization suggests that the shark may be acting under the influence of a vengeful voodoo [[witch doctor]] (who has a feud with the Brody family), and the shark's apparent revenge has magical implications. Taken from the earlier drafts of the screenplay, the shark is directed by a voodoo curse laid by Papa Jacques, a Haitian witch doctor. Film scholar I.Q. Hunter explains, \"The revenge of the title is, therefore, Papa Jacques\u2019 and not the shark\u2019s, which entirely changes the story\u2019s meaning: the shark, impelled by \u2018stranger forces man could never understand,\u2019 is an instrument of postcolonial revenge.\"<ref name=\"hunter\"/> This also explains the strange psychic connection Ellen and the shark have with each other. The plot was deleted as it strayed too far away from the plot of the killer shark. However, at one point in the theatrical version, Michael Brody says, \"Come on, sharks don't commit murder.
