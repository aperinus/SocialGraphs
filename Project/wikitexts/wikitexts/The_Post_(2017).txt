On the flight home, McNamara tells Ellsberg and [[William B. Macomber Jr.|William B. Macomber]] the war is hopeless. To the congregated media however, he says he believes in the war effort. Overhearing this abrupt turn-about, Ellsberg becomes disillusioned. Years later, as a civilian military contractor/consultant working for the [[RAND Corporation]] (a military/defense \"think tank\"), Ellsberg copies thousands of pages of classified reports documenting the country's decades-long involvement in Vietnam, starting in the [[Presidency of Harry S. Truman|Truman administration]]. He then leaks them to ''[[The New York Times]]'', via reporter [[Neil Sheehan]].\n\nIn 1971, [[Katharine Graham]] has been owner and publisher of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' for the past eight years, following the suicide of its former publisher, her husband [[Phil Graham]], and the death of her father, [[Eugene Meyer (financier)|Eugene Meyer]], the previous owner. She nervously prepares the Post's stock market launch, to financially stabilize the paper. Graham lacks journalistic experience and is frequently overruled by her male, domineering financial advisers and editors, including editor-in-chief (executive editor) [[Ben Bradlee]] and board member Arthur Parsons.\n\nMcNamara, a long-time friend of hers, advises Graham that an unflattering story featuring him will be published in ''The New York Times'', another example of the ''Times''' ability to get preemptive scoops while the ''Post'' languishes behind. The story is an expos\u00e9 of the American government's long-running deception about America's position in Vietnam and Southeast Asia. However, a federal district court injunction halts the ''Times'' from publishing further articles on the subject.\n\n''Post'' assistant editor [[Ben Bagdikian]] tracks down Ellsberg, a former colleague, as the source for the leak. He provides him copies of the same material given previously to the ''Times''. ''Post'' reporters pore over mounds of pages, searching for additional headlines. Their attorneys advise against publishing the material, lest the [[Presidency of Richard Nixon|Nixon administration]] file criminal charges. Graham confers with McNamara, Bradlee, and trusted ''Post'' chairman [[Fritz Beebe]], as she agonizes about publishing it.\n\nBradlee tells Graham politician friends (including [[John F. Kennedy]], as shown in the top-secret documents) abused their friendships by lying to them; her friendship with McNamara must not factor in on the decision whether to publish. The situation intensifies when the lawyers confirm Bagdikian\u2019s source is the same as the ''Times'', possibly putting Graham in [[contempt of court]] and potentially destroying the newspaper and her family's ownership and legacy. Alternately, if the legal challenges are overcome in court, the ''Post'' could emerge as a significant journalistic institution and increase its reputation. Graham gives the go ahead.\n\nThe ''Post'' and ''Times'' jointly appear before the [[Supreme Court]] to plead their [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] rights. Meanwhile, in solidarity with the once isolated ''Post'' and ''Times'', other major newspapers start publishing about the secret war study. On June 30, 1971, the Supreme Court's justices, in the case of ''[[New York Times Co. v. United States]]'', rule 6\u20133 in the two newspapers' favor, vindicating Graham's decision to print. Shortly after, President [[Richard Nixon]] demands that the ''Post'' be barred from the White House.\n\nThe film ends with a sequence showing the discovery of the [[Watergate scandal|Watergate]] burglary by security guard [[Frank Wills (security guard)|Frank Wills]], which was further exposed by the ''Post'' and ultimately led to Nixon\u2019s resignation.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Meryl Streep]] as [[Katharine Graham]]\n* [[Tom Hanks]] as [[Ben Bradlee]]\n* [[Sarah Paulson]] as Antoinette \"Tony\" Pinchot Bradlee\n* [[Bob Odenkirk]] as [[Ben Bagdikian]]\n* [[Tracy Letts]] as [[Fritz Beebe]]\n* [[Bradley Whitford]] as Arthur Parsons\n* [[Bruce Greenwood]] as [[Robert McNamara]]\n* [[Carolyn McCormick]] as Mrs. McNamara\n* [[Matthew Rhys]] as [[Daniel Ellsberg]]\n* [[Alison Brie]] as [[Lally Weymouth|Lally Graham]]\n* [[Carrie Coon]] as [[Meg Greenfield]]\n* [[Jesse Plemons]] as Roger Clark\n* [[David Cross]] as [[Howard Simons]]\n* [[Zach Woods]] as Anthony Essaye\n* [[Michael Stuhlbarg]] as [[A.
