The movie traces the origins of [[surfing]] and specifically focuses on the art of [[big wave surfing|big wave riding]]. Some of the featured surfers are [[Greg Noll]], [[Laird Hamilton]],  and [[Jeff Clark (surfer)|Jeff Clark]], and surfing pioneers such as [[Mickey Munoz]].\n\n==Synopsis==\nThe film begins with a historical overview, starting at its [[History of surfing|Hawaiian beginnings]], then moves on to focus on the dangerous lure of big-wave surfing (surfing waves that can reach up to 70 feet (21 meters)). The documentary chronicles the evolution of riding at Hawaii's [[Waimea Bay]] in the 1950s, the revolution of lighter boards, and [[tow-in surfing]] to allow for \"''riding giants''\". Three surfers who are part of this multi-generational evolution are spotlighted: [[Greg Noll]] is shown as a fearless big wave rider during the 1950s and 1960s; [[Jeff Clark (surfer)|Jeff Clark]] who discovered [[Mavericks (location)|Mavericks]] in Northern California and surfed there alone for years; and [[Laird Hamilton]], the contemporary surfer who brings tow-in riding to the limelight.\n\n==Production==\nPeralta previously directed the acclaimed documentary ''[[Dogtown and Z-Boys]]'', which documented the rise of skateboarding, of which he was an integral part. The French producer Franck Marty, along with his partners, chose him to direct a new breed of big wave riding documentary film. He has said that the primary purpose of making a surfing documentary was that he \"wanted to see a film like this\", and that he hoped it helped to answer the question \"why people choose to devote their entire lives to the pursuit of riding waves.\"<ref>{{cite web | title = Riding Giants official site interview with Stacy Peralta| publisher = Sony Pictures Classics| url = http://www.sonyclassics.com/ridinggiants/}}</ref>\n\n''Riding Giants'' utilizes stills, archive footage, \"re-enacted\" footage, home movies, and interviews. Some of the surfers interviewed include [[Jeff Clark (surfer)|Jeff Clark]], [[Laird Hamilton]], [[Dave Kalama]], [[Gerry Lopez]], [[Greg Noll]], [[Kelly Slater]] and [[Peter Mel]].\n\n==Soundtrack music==\nIncludes: [[Basement Jaxx]], [[David Bowie]], [[Link Wray]], [[Dick Dale]], [[Doves (band)|Doves]], [[Fila Brazillia]], [[Bill Haley & His Comets]], [[The Hives]], [[Linkin Park]], [[John Mayall]], [[Moby]], [[Pearl Jam]], [[The Ruts]], [[Screamin' Jay Hawkins]], [[Soundgarden]], [[The Stray Cats]], [[Alice in Chains]], [[\u00c9rik Satie]] and [[The Waterboys]].\n\n==Reception==\n''Riding Giants'' was the first documentary film to open the [[Sundance Film Festival]]. It won the 2004 A.C.E. Eddie Award for Best Edited Documentary by editor [[Paul Crowder (filmmaker)|Paul Crowder]]. According to [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film has a 92% fresh rating, having earned mostly positive reviews from critics.<ref>[http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/riding_giants/ ''Riding Giants'' - Reviews at Rotten Tomatoes]</ref> [[Roger Ebert]] said in his review, \"Before seeing ''Riding Giants'', my ideas about surfing were formed by the ''Gidget'' movies, ''Endless Summer'', [[The Beach Boys]], [[Elvis Presley|Elvis]] and lots of TV commercials. ''Riding Giants'' is about altogether another reality.\"\n\n==See also==\n* ''[[Step into Liquid]]''\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{IMDb title|0389326}}\n* {{Amg movie|300016}}\n\n[[Category:2004 films]]\n[[Category:2004 documentary films]]\n[[Category:French documentary films]]\n[[Category:2000s English-language films]]\n[[Category:Big wave surfing]]\n[[Category:Films set in Hawaii]]\n[[Category:Documentary films about surfing]]\n[[Category:StudioCanal films]]\n[[Category:Documentary films about Hawaii]]\n[[Category:American surfing films]]\n[[Category:Sony Pictures Classics films]]\n[[Category:American sports documentary films]]\n[[Category:2000s American films]]\n[[Category:2000s French films]]"}]}}}}
