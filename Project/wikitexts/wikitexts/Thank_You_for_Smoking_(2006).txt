It follows the efforts of [[Big Tobacco]]'s chief spokesman, Nick Naylor, who lobbies on behalf of cigarettes using heavy [[Spin (public relations)|spin tactics]] while also trying to remain a role model for his 12-year-old son. [[Maria Bello]], [[Adam Brody]], [[Sam Elliott]], [[Katie Holmes]], [[Rob Lowe]], [[William H. Macy]], [[J. K. Simmons]], and [[Robert Duvall]] appear in supporting roles.\n\nThe film was released in a [[Limited release|limited run]] on March 17, 2006, and had a [[wide release]] on April 14. It received largely positive reviews, with particular praise for its screenplay, humor, themes, and Eckhart's performance. As of 2007, the film had grossed a total of more than $39 million worldwide.<ref name=\"BOM\">{{cite web | title=Weekend Box Office | work=BoxOfficeMojo.com | url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=thankyouforsmoking.htm| access-date=May 7, 2006}}</ref> The film was released on DVD in the US on October 3, 2006, and in the UK on January 8, 2007.\n\n==Plot==\nNick Naylor ([[Aaron Eckhart]]) is a [[Big Tobacco]] spokesman using \"research\" from an institution he's the [[vice-president]] of, a [[tobacco politics|tobacco lobby]] called the \"Academy of Tobacco Studies\". It claims there is no link between tobacco and lung disease. Naylor and his friends, firearm lobbyist Bobby Jay Bliss ([[David Koechner]]) and alcohol lobbyist Polly Bailey ([[Maria Bello]]), meet every week and jokingly call themselves the \"Merchants of Death\" or \"The MOD Squad\". As anti-tobacco campaigns mount and numbers of young smokers decline, Naylor's boss, BR ([[J. K. Simmons]]), sends Naylor to [[Los Angeles]] to bargain for cigarette [[product placement]] in upcoming movies. Naylor takes along his young son, Joey ([[Cameron Bright]]), in hopes of bonding with him. The next day, Naylor is sent to meet with Lorne Lutch ([[Sam Elliott]]), the [[cancer]]-stricken man who once played the [[Marlboro Man]] in cigarette ads and is now campaigning against cigarettes. As his son watches, Naylor successfully offers Lutch a suitcase of money for his silence.\n\nSenator Finistirre ([[William H. Macy]]), one of Naylor's most vehement critics, promotes a bill to add a [[Skull and crossbones (poison)|skull and crossbones POISON warning]] to cigarette packaging. As Naylor is about to appear before a [[U.S. Senate]] committee to fight the bill, he is kidnapped by a clandestine group and covered in [[nicotine patch]]es. Awakening in a hospital, he learns he has survived due to his high nicotine tolerance from heavy smoking, but he is now [[Hypersensitivity|hypersensitive]] to nicotine and can never smoke again. Meanwhile, Naylor is seduced by a young reporter named Heather Holloway ([[Katie Holmes]]) into revealing secret information about his life and career. She makes it public via an expos\u00e9, criticizing his business activities and accusing him of training his son Joey to follow his amoral example. This results in negative PR for Naylor, which costs him his job.\n\nNaylor tells the press about his affair with Holloway and promises to clear the names of everyone mentioned in her article. He then appears before the Senate committee, admitting to the dangers of smoking but arguing that public awareness is already high enough without extra warnings. He emphasizes consumer choice and responsibility and claims that if tobacco companies are guilty of tobacco-related deaths, then perhaps Finistirre's state of [[Vermont]], as a major cheese producer, is likewise guilty of [[cholesterol]]-related deaths.\n\nAlthough BR offers Naylor his old job again, Naylor rejects it as Big Tobacco is [[Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement|settling claims of liability]]. He also mentions Heather was humiliated upon being terminated by the paper for her article and has been reduced to a cub reporter handling weather on a local news station. Naylor supports his son's newfound interest in debating and opens a private lobbying firm. The MOD squad continues to meet with new members that represent the fast-food, oil, and biohazard industries. Now Naylor runs an agency called ''Naylor Strategic Relations'' and consults cellphone industry representatives concerned about [[Mobile phone radiation and health|claims that cellphones cause brain cancer]], he narrates: \"[[Michael Jordan]] plays ball. [[Charles Manson]] kills people. I talk. Everyone has a talent.\"\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Aaron Eckhart]] as Nick Naylor, Spokesman For The Academy of Tobacco Studies.\n* [[Cameron Bright]] as Joey Naylor, Nick's Son\n* [[Katie Holmes]] as Heather Holloway, Reporter For The ''Washington Probe''.\n* [[Maria Bello]] as Polly Bailey, Spokeswoman For The Alcohol Industry.\n* [[David Koechner]] as Bobby Jay Bliss, Spokesman For S.A.F.E.T.Y ('''S'''ociety for the '''A'''dvancement of '''F'''irearms and '''E'''ffective '''T'''raining for '''Y'''outh).\n* [[William H.

Every one of his first choices accepted his or her part and most thanked Reitman for his letter. Reitman was also able to persuade Eckhart, Holmes, Macy, and Lowe to sign on to the film with minimum pay.<ref name=\"Sutherland\"/>\n\n==Production==\n[[Mel Gibson]]'s [[Icon Productions]] bought the rights to Buckley's novel before its release. Initially, Gibson saw himself as starring as Nick Naylor in the adaptation.<ref name= \"Waxman\">{{cite news | last = Waxman | first = Sharon | title = The Son Also Directs | work = [[The New York Times]] | pages = B9 | date = September 10, 2006 | url = https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990DE1DA1331F933A2575AC0A9639C8B63 | access-date = April 25, 2006 }}</ref> However, the satiric nature of the book meant the studio lacked a way to film it and the project lacked a usable script.<ref name=\"Turan, Kenneth\">{{cite web| url=http://www.calendarlive.com/movies/turan/cl-et-smoking17mar17,0,923325.story | title=Thank You for Smoking| author=Turan, Kenneth  | work=[[Los Angeles Times]] | date=March 17, 2006}}</ref> Reitman became interested in heading an adaptation after reading the book, and independently wrote a draft for Icon executives after he discovered they owned the rights to the film. Reitman saw himself as a comic writer with a voice similar to Buckley's, and consciously attempted to maintain the satiric flavor of the book for his draft.<ref name= \"Harrison\">{{cite news | last = Harrison| first = Eric| title = Taking on Tobacco | work = [[The Houston Chronicle]] | pages = 10 | date = March 30, 2006 }}</ref> The script was received favorably by Icon, and Gibson called Reitman to tell him how much he loved it.<ref name=\"Waxman\"/> But over the next three years, the project languished because of a lack of financing and big studio interest, as most studios wanted Reitman to rewrite his script to include a more anti-smoking and uplifting ending. According to Reitman, studios wanted Naylor to have a change of heart by the film's end and repent for his past.<ref name= \"Sutherland\">{{cite news | last = Sutherland| first = Claire| title = Reitman smokes out studio | work = [[Herald Sun (Australia)]] | pages = I18 | date = August 31, 2006 }}</ref>\n\nIt was only after meeting [[David O. Sacks]], who had made his fortune as the former COO of the Internet payment company [[PayPal]], that Reitman found a financier for his script. A first-time producer, Sacks spent over a year trying to acquire the rights to the film from Icon. He financed most of the film's $8.5 million budget and let Reitman keep most of his original draft.<ref name=\"Waxman\"/> The project marked Reitman's first feature-length film as a director, though he previously directed short films and commercials and had worked on the set of his father, director [[Ivan Reitman]].\n\nDuring the filming, Reitman made the conscious decision not to show any actual smoking of cigarettes. The only scenes that include smoking are older films the characters watch, such as when [[John Wayne]] lights up in ''[[Sands of Iwo Jima]]''.\n\nBefore the film was screened at the Sundance Film Festival, internet rumors claimed that an extended nudity scene between Eckhart and Holmes had been cut down after pressure from Holmes' husband, [[Tom Cruise]]. Reitman and executives denied that such a scene had ever existed but welcomed the publicity it garnered for the film. Reitman later said that \"Half the questions that I've been getting are thoughtful questions about the moral of lobbying and how does satire work. And the rest is just, 'Is there actually any nude footage out there?'\"<ref name= \"Rea\">{{cite news | last = Rea| first = Steven| title = He'll take publicity\u2014good, off-the-wall\u2014thanks much | work = [[The Philadelphia Inquirer]] | pages = H02 | date = March 19, 2006 }}</ref>\n\nControversy also arose after the film was screened at the Toronto Film Festival. ''Thank You for Smoking'' was met with tremendous popular reception and afterward disputed claims emerged as to who had signed a distribution deal with Sacks. [[Fox Searchlight Pictures]] and [[Paramount Vantage|Paramount Classics]] both issued competing press releases claiming that they had secured rights for the film's distribution. Sacks later claimed that he never reached a firm deal with Paramount, and noted that Fox Searchlight had offered $7 million for distribution, while Paramount Classics offered $6.7 million. Allegedly, Sacks called Paramount at 1:15&nbsp;a.m. saying he was uncomfortable with their initial deal. Ruth Vitale, co-president of Paramount Classics said \"He can't resell the film\" and noted \"I can only think that because of his naivet\u00e9 and inexperience he would do this.\"<ref name=\"Waxman\"/>\n\nSerial entrepreneur [[Elon Musk]] is credited as Executive Producer of ''Thank You for Smoking''.

Steve Palopoli of ''[[Metro Silicon Valley]]'' writes that \"no matter\" how much the hype machine might hard-sell the idea that the movie 'skewers both sides of the issue', \"any child old enough to recognize Joe Camel can tell that underneath the sarcastic joking, this is a bitterly anti-smoking film.\"<ref>{{cite web |author=Palopoli |first=Steve |date=March 29, 2006 |title=The New Insincerity |url=http://www.metroactive.com/metro-santa-cruz/03.29.06/smoking-0613.html |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061017231510/http://www.metroactive.com/metro-santa-cruz/03.29.06/smoking-0613.html |archive-date=October 17, 2006 |work=[[Metro Silicon Valley]]}}</ref> Palopoli goes on to say \"the supposed case against the anti-smoking lobby has been reduced mostly to some limp jokes at the expense of William H. Macy's senator character, who is fervently against the tobacco lobby\". Many felt the film's relatively sappy ending negated the slicker, darker tone of the book. ''[[The Washington Post]]''{{'}}s Desson Thomson thought that \"as written and directed by Jason Reitman, 'Smoking' is filtered too heavily with moral redemption.\"<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/gog/movies/thank-you-for-smoking,1115743/critic-review.html#reviewNum1 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121110125649/http://www.washingtonpost.com/gog/movies/thank-you-for-smoking,1115743/critic-review.html#reviewNum1 | url-status=dead | archive-date=November 10, 2012 | title= Thank You for Smoking | author=Thomson, Desson | work=[[The Washington Post]] | access-date=April 28, 2010}}</ref>\n\nReitman has maintained his purpose was to match the tone and satirical message of the book as closely as possible. \"What I wanted people to think about was political correctness. I wanted them to think about ideas of personal responsibility and personal choice. I think cigarettes are a wonderful location for that discussion because cigarettes are something we know all the answers to\", he posits. \"I wanted to look into this idea of why we feel the need to tell each other how to live and why we can't take personal responsibility for our own actions when we fall ill from things that we know are dangerous.\"<ref>{{cite web |date=August 16, 2006 |title=Thank You For Smoking Interview |url=http://www.abc.net.au/atthemovies/txt/s1714051.htm |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070306051512/http://www.abc.net.au/atthemovies/txt/s1714051.htm |archive-date=March 6, 2007 |publisher=abc.net.au}}</ref> [[Stephanie Zacharek]] of [[Salon.com|Salon]] agreed with Reitman, saying \"Despite its title, the movie doesn't come packaged with a strong anti-smoking message, because it doesn't need to: Everyone knows that smoking is bad for you, including people who continue to do it.\"<ref name=\"Zacharek, Stephanie\"/>\n\nThere is no point during the film at which any of the characters smoke. Dargis of ''The New York Times'' unwittingly states, \"''Thank You for Smoking'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It includes mild violence, discreet sex and, of course, countless cigarettes.\"<ref name=\"Dargis, Manohla\"/> In the film, even Robert Duvall's filtered cigarette maverick \"The Captain\" is shown repeatedly drinking [[mint julep]]s rather than smoking cigarettes. Some critics argue that Reitman's reluctance to show the characters smoking is further confirmation of the film's anti-smoking stance. Reitman has issued statements disagreeing with this view.

The first nine tracks are popular songs about smoking taken from the 1940s, 1950s, and 1960s. The famous track \"[[Smoke! Smoke! Smoke! (That Cigarette)]]\" opens the film. The final four tracks are instrumentals from the original score of Rolfe Kent, who had been nominated for best original score for his work on ''[[Sideways]]''. AllMusic wrote that \"The thread is obvious, but the selections sound handpicked rather than researched solely on the basis of their subject matter.\" Other critics have called the soundtrack \"demented.\"<ref name= \"Braun\">{{cite news|last=Braun|first=Liz|title =Smoke Screen; Film's Dark Humour Brilliantly Enlightens Us on the Art of Spin|work=[[The Toronto Sun]]|pages=E8| date=March 24, 2006}}</ref>\n\n# \"[[Smoke!
