''Fury'' was Lang's first American film.\n\n==Plot==\n[[File:Spencer tracy fury.jpg|thumb|[[Spencer Tracy]] as Joe Wilson]]\n\nEn route to meet his fianc\u00e9e Katherine Grant, gas-station owner Joe Wilson is arrested on flimsy circumstantial evidence for the [[kidnapping]] of a child. Gossip soon travels around the small town, growing more distorted through each retelling, until a mob gathers at the jail. When the resolute sheriff refuses to give up his prisoner, the enraged townspeople burn down the building, throwing [[dynamite]] into the flames as they flee the scene. Unknown to anyone else there, the blast frees Joe but kills his little dog Rainbow, who had run in to comfort him in the cell.\n\nThe [[district attorney]] brings the main perpetrators to trial for murder, but nobody is willing to identify the guilty, and several provide false alibis. The case seems hopeless, but then the prosecutor produces hard evidence: [[newsreel]] footage of 22 people caught in the act.\n\nKatherine discovers that Joe escaped the fire and that his brothers are helping him take revenge by concealing his survival and framing the defendants for his murder. She goes to see Joe and pleads with him to stop the charade, but he is determined to make his would-be killers pay. His conscience begins to weigh on him and, just as the verdicts are being read, he walks into the courtroom and sets things straight.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Sylvia Sidney]] as Katherine Grant\n* [[Spencer Tracy]] as Joe Wilson\n* [[Walter Abel]] as Adams, the District Attorney\n* [[Bruce Cabot]] as Kirby Dawson\n* [[Edward Ellis (actor)|Edward Ellis]] as Sheriff\n* [[Walter Brennan]] as \"Bugs\" Meyers\n* [[Frank Albertson]] as Charlie\n* [[George Walcott]] as Tom\n* [[Arthur Stone (actor)|Arthur Stone]] as Durkin\n* [[Morgan Wallace]] as Fred Garrett\n* [[George Chandler]] as Milton Jackson\n* [[Roger Gray (actor)|Roger Gray]] as Stranger\n* [[Edwin Maxwell (actor)|Edwin Maxwell]] as Will Vickery\n* [[Howard Hickman]] as Governor\n* [[Jonathan Hale]] as Defense Attorney\n* [[Leila Bennett]] as Edna Hooper\n* [[Esther Dale]] as Mrs. Whipple\n* [[Helen Flint]] as Franchette\n* [[Gwen Lee]] as Mrs. Fred Garrett (uncredited)\n* [[Frederick Burton (actor)|Frederick Burton]] as Judge Daniel Hopkins (uncredited)\n{{div col end}}\n\nThe part of Wilson's dog Rainbow was played by [[Terry (dog)|Terry]], the same [[Cairn Terrier]] who played Toto in ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]''.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==Development==\n[[Norman Krasna]] was inspired to write the story after reading about a lynching in ''[[The Nation]]''. He pitched the idea to [[Samuel Marx]] and [[Joseph L. Mankiewicz]] at MGM, who were attracted to it. Krasna claimed that he did not write a script; he verbally pitched it to Mankiewicz, who then dictated it.<ref name=\"pat\">McGilligan, Patrick, \"Norman Krasna: The Woolworth's Touch\", ''Backstory: Interviews with Screenwriters of Hollywood's Golden Age'', University of California Press,1986 pp. 218\u2013219</ref> Multiple changes were made from Krasna's story to the final script.<ref>Skolsky, Sidney. \"Hollywood\".

The film was a major departure for [[MGM]], known for its lavish musicals and glitzy dramas; the expensive production features expansive and stylized sets to create its gritty world, and its style is more in keeping with the social-issue films associated with [[Warner Bros.]], such as ''[[I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang]]''.<ref>[[Bogdanovich, Peter]] (2005).

Lang, who credited himself with changing the protagonist from a lawyer to a mechanic, also said that he wanted to reveal that the protagonist had committed the murder.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=deq3xI8OmCkC&pg=PT246 Essay] by Daniel Eagan in ''America's Film Legacy: The Authoritative Guide to the Landmark Movies in the National Film Registry'', A&C Black, 2010 {{ISBN|0826429777}}, pp. 246\u2013247</ref>\n\n==Reception==\nThe film received an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Story|Best Writing, Original Story]].
