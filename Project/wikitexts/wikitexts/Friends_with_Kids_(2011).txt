[[Adam Scott (actor)|Adam Scott]], [[Jon Hamm]], [[Kristen Wiig]], [[Maya Rudolph]], [[Chris O'Dowd]], [[Megan Fox]], and [[Edward Burns]] also star in the film.\n\n== Plot ==\nJason (an advertising executive) and Julie (a charitable investment advisor) are longtime best friends now in their mid-30s that live in the same building in Manhattan. Not romantically involved, they are close friends with two childless married couples, the placid Alex and Leslie and the sex-obsessed Ben and Missy. During the next four years, after both couples have children, their marriages suffer. Following a chaotic birthday party for Jason at Alex and Leslie's place in Brooklyn, Jason and Julie discuss how it would be better to have children first, to 'get it out of the way' since 'time is running out', and only then meet the person that you wanted to marry.  After more discussion, they decide to have a child together, despite never having had romantic feelings for each other, and then to continue to date other people, to find 'their one'.  Although their friends predict disaster, Jason and Julie adjust to their new relationship with baby Joe far better than their friends had imagined.<ref name=\"thrinfo\"/>\n\nJason and Julie begin dating again and enter into budding relationships with young actress Mary Jane and divorced father Kurt, respectively. During a couples winter getaway in Vermont, Ben calls Jason and Julie's thought process and parenting skills into question. In the ensuing argument, Ben decries their arrangement as untenable in the long term and humiliates Missy. Jason defends his decision to have a child with Julie, saying that he loves her deeply and that she was the soundest choice of person for him to start a family with.\n\nAfter returning from Vermont, Ben and Missy separate and later divorce. Shortly thereafter, at Julie's birthday dinner out (about 18 months after Joe's birth), Jason is surprised to find that she invited only him. Julie tells him that Kurt wants her to meet his children that weekend but that this new degree of commitment has made her realize that she is in love with Jason, who, along with Joe, have become her closest family. A stunned Jason tells Julie that his love for her has never been romantic and has asked Mary Jane to move in with him. Heartbroken, Julie leaves the restaurant, and soon moves out of her Manhattan apartment to Brooklyn, putting some space between herself and Jason. A few months thereafter, Jason and Mary Jane break up over their differing feelings about children, and both Julie and Jason return to dating others. Several months later, at a bar with Ben, Jason confides that he does have feelings for Julie, but that their messy split makes acting on such feelings impossible. Ben disagrees, noting the differences between his and Missy's sex-based relationship and Jason and Julie's long-lasting friendship.\n\nShortly before Julie's next birthday, after dropping {{frac|2|1|2}}-year-old Joe off at Julie's house after a day out, Jason presents her with a present: a photo scrapbook of the couple, and then the three of them (that he'd made for her birthday prior, but she never received due to their abrupt parting), consistent with Julie's prior statement that Jason and Joe were her family. They reminisce over several of the photos and then put Joe to bed, after Jason says a few things about 'staying the night' (as Joe wants him to). Jason's emotional shift and words make Julie emotional and uncomfortable, so she sends Jason home. He leaves, but quickly returns, and tells her what he said to her a year ago was all wrong. He finally realized it\u2014she is the love of his life, she is his 'person', \"and that's just the way it is\". She tells him she can't be with someone who isn't 'into' her, and he, after a passionate kiss, offers to have sex with her to prove he ''is'' into her, in every possible way. She accepts his offer, passionately kisses him back, and they tumble onto her bed.\n\n== Cast ==\n<!-- list in order of opening credits -->\n* [[Adam Scott (actor)|Adam Scott]] as Jason Fryman<ref name=\"thrinfo\">{{cite web |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/exclusive-megan-fox-joins-jon-30925 |title=EXCLUSIVE: Megan Fox Joins Jon Hamm, Kristen Wiig in 'Friends With Kids' |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |publisher=[[Prometheus Global Media]] |first=Boyrs |last=Kit |date=October 18, 2010 |access-date=July 3, 2011}}</ref>\n* [[Jennifer Westfeldt]] as Julie Keller<ref name=\"thrinfo\"/>\n* [[Jon Hamm]] as Ben<ref name=\"thrinfo\"/>\n* [[Kristen Wiig]] as Missy<ref name=\"thrinfo\"/>\n* [[Maya Rudolph]] as Leslie\n* [[Chris O'Dowd]] as Alex\n* [[Megan Fox]] as Mary Jane<ref name=\"thrinfo\"/><ref name=\"nypostinfo\"/>\n* [[Edward Burns]] as Kurt\n* [[Lee Bryant]] as Elaine Keller, Julie's mother\n* [[Kelly Bishop]] as Mary Fryman, Jason's mother\n* [[Cotter Smith]] as Phil Fryman, Jason's father\n* [[Ilana Levine]] as Mom in Restaurant\n* [[Brian D'Arcy James]] as Husband in Restaurant\n* [[John Lutz]] as Jason's Colleague at Work\n* [[Derek Cecil]] as Pete\n\n== Production ==\n''Friends with Kids'' was directed, written, produced and stars [[Jennifer Westfeldt]].<ref name=\"thrinfo\"/> This is her directorial debut.<ref name=\"nypostinfo\">{{cite web |url=http://www.nypost.com/p/blogs/popwrap/the_benefits_of_being_friends_with_3A5lV8ZFuq6JH4miv32VHJ#ixzz1R57qGyEz |title=The benefits of being 'Friends' with Megan Fox |work=[[New York Post]] |first=Jarett |last=Wieselman |publisher=Paul Carlucci |date=December 8, 2010 |access-date=July 3, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111130095943/http://www.nypost.com/p/blogs/popwrap/the_benefits_of_being_friends_with_3A5lV8ZFuq6JH4miv32VHJ#ixzz1R57qGyEz |archive-date=November 30, 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Her then-partner, actor [[Jon Hamm]], also agreed to play a supporting part and help produce her feature film.<ref name=\"thrinfo\"/> The idea for ''Friends With Kids'' had been floating around after Westfeldt and Hamm noticed that friends were starting to have families and 'all but disappearing from their lives.'
