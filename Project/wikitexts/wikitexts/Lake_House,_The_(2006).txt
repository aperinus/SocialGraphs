Kate leaves a note in the mailbox asking the next tenant to forward her mail, adding that the paint-embedded [[pawprint]]s on the path leading to the house were there when she arrived.\n\nTwo years earlier, in 2004, Alex Wyler, an [[architect]], arrives at the lake house and finds Kate's letter in the mailbox. The house is neglected, with no sign of paw prints anywhere. During the subsequent restoration of the house, a dog runs through Alex's paint and leaves fresh paw prints where Kate said they would be. Baffled, Alex writes back, placing the letter in the mailbox, asking how Kate knew about the paw prints since the house was unoccupied until he arrived. The dog, Jack, then becomes owned by both Kate and Alex within their places in time.  On [[Valentine's Day]] 2006, Kate witnesses a [[traffic accident]] near [[Daley Plaza]] and tries to save the male victim  unsuccessfully. She impulsively drives back to the lake house, finds Alex's letter, and writes back.\n\nAlex and Kate continue passing messages to each other via the mailbox, and each watches its flag go up and down as the message leaves and the reply arrives as they wait. They then discover that they are living exactly two years apart. Their correspondence takes them through several events, including Alex finding a book, [[Jane Austen]]'s ''[[Persuasion (novel)|Persuasion]]'', at a [[train station|railway station]] where Kate said she would have lost it and Alex taking Kate on a [[walking tour]] of his favorite places in Chicago via an annotated map that he leaves in the mailbox. Alex eventually meets Kate at her then-boyfriend's party; however, he doesn't mention their exchange of letters because it has not happened to Kate yet. \n\nAs Alex and Kate continue to write to each other, they decide to try to meet again. Alex makes a reservation at the Il Mare restaurant \u2013 two years into Alex's future but only a day away for Kate. Kate goes to the restaurant, but Alex fails to show. Heartbroken, Kate asks Alex not to write to her again, recounting the accident earlier that day. Both Alex and Kate leave the lake house, continuing on with their separate lives.\n\nOn Valentine's Day 2006 for Alex, Valentine's Day 2008 for Kate, he returns to the lake house after something about the day triggers a memory. Meanwhile, Kate goes to an [[architect]] to review the renovation plans for a house she wants to buy. A drawing of the lake house on the conference room wall catches her attention, and Henry Wyler informs her the artist was his brother, Alex, and Kate realizes that this was the Alex with whom she had been corresponding. She also learns that Alex was killed in a traffic accident exactly two years ago and realizes why he never showed up for their date \u2013 he was the man who died in Daley Plaza.\n\nRushing to the lake house, Kate frantically writes a letter telling Alex she loves him but begs him not to try to find her if he loves her back. Wait two years, she says, and come to the lake house instead. Meanwhile, in 2006, Alex has gone to Daley Plaza to look for Kate. He stands across the street from the plaza, and just as it seems he is about to cross, he reaches into his pocket to look at a note from Kate.\n\nAt the lake house, Kate drops to her knees sobbing, fearing that she has arrived too late to stop Alex. Not long afterwards, a truck pulls up. She walks forward smiling as the driver approaches. She and Alex kiss and walk toward the lake house.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Keanu Reeves]] as Alex Wyler, a young architect who designs suburban condominiums. He has a strained relationship with his father Simon, a renowned but egocentric architect. Alex moves into the lake house even though he hates it and its impractical design.\n* [[Sandra Bullock]] as Dr. Kate Forster, a physician who starts a new job at the Chicago hospital. She is the former tenant of the lake house. Her boyfriend is Morgan, whom she subsequently becomes engaged to and then breaks up with.\n* [[Christopher Plummer]] as Simon Wyler, Alex's estranged, narcissistic father. He is a famous Chicago architect and the original designer of the Lake House.\n* [[Ebon Moss-Bachrach]] as Henry Wyler, Alex's brother. He eventually opens his own architectural firm, Visionary Vanguard Associates.\n* [[Shohreh Aghdashloo]] as Dr. Anna Klyczynski, Kate's older boss, mentor, and friend.\n* [[Dylan Walsh]] as Morgan Price, Kate's boyfriend turned fianc\u00e9.

wrote that Portman \"nails it once more\" with her use of \"elegiac strings and impressionistic piano\" to match the \"soft\" seasonal scenes and \"subdued tones in the film's frames\", the \"relatively low-key performances\" of both leads, and the \"languid changes\" of the plot, noting that the theme of longing present in the film \"is used as an almost painterly device to hold the music inside\". He further stated, \"There is an ache in this music, proposed by the notion of absence rather than sheer loneliness. Something is missing, and Portman's score brings back this feeling again and again\". Jurek cited the composer's \"use of space in allowing a cello to unravel in the lyric line\" on \"Pawprints\" and \"Il Mare\" as a \"beautiful device for revelation\".<ref name=Allmusic/>\n\nBrian McVicker of ''[[Soundtrack.Net]]'' also gave the album a favourable review and rated it 3.5 out of 5 stars, writing that the \"song[s] and score work well in conjunction with each other, keeping a consistent tone from start to finish\".

Addressing the film's logical inconsistencies, Ebert said he was not \"bothered in the slightest\" as \"[a] time travel story works on emotional, not temporal, logic\". He praised Bullock and Reeves in their respective roles, noting that a \"great deal depends on the personalities involved\", and called both \"enormously likeable\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/the-lake-house-2006|title=The Lake House movie review & film summary (2006)|last=Ebert|first=Roger|date=June 15, 2006|website=RogerEbert.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130603074525/https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/the-lake-house-2006|archive-date=June 3, 2013|url-status=live|access-date=June 1, 2020}}</ref> The ''[[New York Times]]''{{'}}s A.

He also expressed appreciation for the film's aesthetic, commenting that it was \"elegant without being terribly showy, with a connoisseur's eye for Chicago's architectural glories\". Scott concluded that overall the film is \"a showcase for its stars, who seem gratifyingly comfortable in their own skin and delighted to be in each other's company again\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/16/movies/16lake.html|title=The Lake House (2006)|last=Scott|first=A.

It attempts to be a romance, a time-traveling mystery and a meditation on loneliness. It doesn't succeed at any of the three\".<ref name=\"USA Today\">{{cite web|url=https://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/movies/reviews/2006-06-15-lake-house_x.htm|title=Illogical 'Lake House' sinks into absurdity|last=Puig|first=Claudia|date=June 15, 2006|work=[[USA Today]]|url-status=live|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130630135453/http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/movies/reviews/2006-06-15-lake-house_x.htm|archive-date=June 30, 2013|access-date=May 31, 2020}}</ref> She further called it a \"melodramatic romance\" that \"moves at a glacial pace\" while also \"tak[ing] itself too seriously\", and concluded by saying that \"Even if we suspend disbelief completely, The Lake House is unconvincing, unsatisfying and unmoving\". Puig did acknowledge the chemistry between Reeves and Bullock, but noted that their moments together in the film were rare.<ref name=\"USA Today\"/> Stax of [[IGN]] described the film as a \"terminally slow, talky and surprisingly uneventful affair\" that \"never capitalizes on the magic that brings Kate and Alex together\". He criticized the \"contrived 'beat the clock' element\" in the plot that \"allow[ed] the characters to cheat fate\", but failed to prove to the audience why they love each other and how they \"complete\" one another, as well as Reeves' monotonous cadence throughout the film, and said Bullock's acting was \"disenchanted, almost blase...[f]or a woman supposedly deeply in love with a man she can't have\". He did concede there were \"a few fleeting moments of levity where the film comes alive\", but felt things were \"so turgid and lethargically paced that even the leads seem bored most of the time\",  ultimately declaring the film \"boring\" and \"devoid of passion\". He gave it a 2.5 out of 5 stars rating,{{efn|IGN still used star ratings at the time}} which the site later revised to a 5/10 score.<ref name=IGN>{{cite web|url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2006/06/15/the-lake-house|title=The Lake House Review: Finding your soul mate can be boring.|date=June 15, 2006|publisher=[[IGN]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210910073502/https://www.ign.com/articles/2006/06/15/the-lake-house|archive-date=September 10, 2021|url-status=live|access-date=September 10, 2021}}</ref>\n\nThe ''[[Orange County Register|OC Register]]''{{'}}s David Germain called the film a \"tear-jerker whose convolutions elicit more chuckles than tears\" and said it \"would have been nice\" if the DVD had included \"commentary from the filmmakers so someone could explain the ridiculous lapses in logic\" in response to its containing seven deleted scenes.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ocregister.com/2006/09/29/the-lake-house-among-new-releases-dvd-reviews/|title='The Lake House' among new releases DVD reviews|last=Germain|first=David|date=September 29, 2006|website=[[Orange County Register]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210910072550/https://www.ocregister.com/2006/09/29/the-lake-house-among-new-releases-dvd-reviews/|archive-date=September 10, 2021|url-status=live|access-date=September 10, 2021}}</ref>\n\n=== Accolades ===\nThe film received a nomination for Choice Liplock (between Bullock and Reeves) at the [[2006 Teen Choice Awards]] and won.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/pictures/2006-teen-choice-awards-show/8/|title=2006 Teen Choice Awards Show|last=Faber|first=Judy|date=August 21, 2006|website=[[CBS News]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131226093200/https://www.cbsnews.com/news/2006-teen-choice-award-winners/|archive-date=December 26, 2013|url-status=live|access-date=November 11, 2021}}</ref>\n\n=== Home media ===\n''The Lake House'' was released on [[DVD]], [[Blu-ray Disc]] and [[HD DVD]] on September 26, 2006 by [[Warner Home Video]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.engadget.com/2006-08-03-the-lake-house-will-be-the-first-movie-to-debut-on-dvd-blu-ray.html|title=The Lake House will be the first movie to debut on DVD, Blu-ray and HD DVD on the same day|last=Lawler|first=R.|date=August 3, 2006|website=[[Engadget]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210910013106/https://www.engadget.com/2006-08-03-the-lake-house-will-be-the-first-movie-to-debut-on-dvd-blu-ray.html|archive-date=September 10, 2021|url-status=live|access-date=September 9, 2021}}</ref> It was the first film to be simultaneously released on all three formats on the same day, and Warner became the first studio to issue a title in this manner.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.tvtechnology.com/news/warner-debuts-first-title-in-hd-dvd-bluray-and-standard|title=Warner Debuts First Title in HD DVD, Blu-ray and Standard|author=<!--Staff writers-->|date=August 9, 2006|website=TV Technology|publisher=[[Future US]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200604185006/https://www.tvtechnology.com/news/warner-debuts-first-title-in-hd-dvd-bluray-and-standard|archive-date=June 4, 2020|url-status=live|access-date=June 4, 2020}}</ref> The single-disc DVD was initially available for [[DVD region code#1|region 1]] territories only, in both widescreen and full-screen editions with [[480i]] resolution\u2014a [[DVD region code#2|region 2]] compatible version was later released on October 9.
