Doug]], [[Malik Yoba]], and [[John Candy]] (in his final film during his lifetime). It is loosely based on the true story of the [[Jamaica national bobsleigh team]]'s debut in [[Jamaica at the 1988 Winter Olympics|competition during]] the [[1988 Winter Olympics]]. ''Cool Runnings'' was released in the United States on October 1, 1993, to generally positive reviews. The film's soundtrack also became popular with [[Jimmy Cliff]] performing a cover of [[Johnny Nash]]'s \"[[I Can See Clearly Now#Jimmy Cliff version|I Can See Clearly Now]]\", which reached the top 40 as a single in the United States, Canada, France, and the United Kingdom.\n\n==Plot==\nIn November 1987, [[Jamaicans|Jamaican]] [[Sprint (running)|sprinter]] Derice Bannock trains to qualify for the [[100 metres]] in the [[1988 Summer Olympics]]. He fails to qualify when fellow runner Junior Bevil accidentally stumbles, not only falling over himself, but knocking down Derice, and another competitor named Yul Brenner.\n \nDerice petitions for a re-heat, but committee leader Barrington Coolidge, though he pities Derice, refuses.  He invites Derice to try again in four years' time, or to try out for one of the only two other sports Jamaica competes in; boxing and cycling.  Derice spots a photograph in Coolidge\u2019s office, featuring his late father Ben, standing next to a fellow Olympic gold medal winner. Coolidge identifies the man as disgraced American [[bobsled]] medallist Irving Blitzer, who was disqualified for cheating in the [[1972 Winter Olympics]], and now works as a bookie, fortunately not far from where Derice lives. Derice realizes he could participate in the [[1988 Winter Olympics]] by forming a bobsled team, recruiting his friend Sanka Coffie, a [[pushcart derby]] champion.\n \nDerice and Sanka track down Blitzer, who at first refuses to help Derice, until learning he is Ben Bannock\u2019s son.  He reluctantly agrees to coach the team. A recruitment drive fails miserably. Blitzer shows a film about bobsledding on a slide projector, but is heckled, and when the lights come on, only Derice and Sanker are still present.  Fortunately, Junior Bevil and Yul Brenner arrive late to the meeting, making the required four-man team.  Junior, like Derice, can't wait another four years to enter the Olympics, and Yul Brenner just wants to get off the island.   The team train with Blitzer, though Coolidge refuses to fund the $20,000 needed to participate in the Olympics, believing the team's inexperience will bring shame to Jamaica.  Derice's attempts to find another sponsor fail miserably. The team are forced to find other ways to earn the money- Sanker tries his hand at busking, with no success.  Yul Brenner holds arm-wrestling contests, and Derice even sets up a kissing booth- these ventures meet with moderate success, but they still haven't anywhere near enough money.  In the end, Junior sells his car to finance the trip.\n\nIn [[Calgary]], Blitzer registers the team, receiving an old bobsled from his former teammate Roger. The Jamaicans struggle to drive the bobsled and adapt to the cold, though exercise and hard work eventually pays off. Derice begins to copy the techniques of the very efficient East German team (referred to as the Swiss team in the movie, but wearing the East German logo on their uniforms).  The East German team, and their captain, Josef Groole- the current bobsled world record holder- constantly heckle the team during try-outs.  Eventually, all the members of the team except Derice get into a bar fight with the East Germans.  Derice reprimands them severely.\n\nAfter weeks of training, the team successfully qualifies for the finals, only to be disqualified by the Olympic committee, as retribution for Blitzer\u2019s prior cheating scandal. Blitzer confronts Kurt Hemphill, his former coach, now a judge in the committee, asking him not to punish the Jamaicans, as they had nothing to do with his cheating scandal. That night, the team are informed that they have been reinstated. On the night the Olympics formally open, Junior\u2019s father arrives to retrieve his son, but Junior stand up to his father, and refuses to go home until after the Olympics.\n \nThe team\u2019s first day on the track is a disaster, finishing in last place. Sanka disapproves of how Derice is copying the Swiss team\u2019s methods, and encourages the team to 'bobsled Jamaican'. They drastically improve on the second day, finishing in eighth place. During their final race, one of the bobsled\u2019s blades detaches, causing it to flip over and crash. Determined to finish the race, the team pick up their bobsled and carry it across the finish line, earning the applause of the other teams and the spectators, including Junior's father, despite their loss. An epilogue explains the team would return home as heroes, [[1992 Winter Olympics|then return to the Winter Olympics four years later]] to participate as equals.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[John Candy]] as Irving \"Irv\" Blitzer\n* [[Leon Robinson]] (credited as Leon) as Derice Bannock\n* [[Doug E.

Of the 103 runs that were completed in the four-man competition, nobody else posted a time over one minute. Thus, after three runs, the Jamaicans were in 26th (last) place with a cumulative time of 3:00.60 after three runs which placed them 3.23 seconds behind Portugal for 25th place, and 10.19 seconds behind the Soviet team that was in third-place, heading into the final run.

As the driver steers, a nut and bolt on the control column work loose, eventually causing a loss of control as the bobsleigh comes out of a turn and subsequently crashes.\n\nIn reality, the crash happened in the third out of four runs, and it was deemed that driver inexperience, excess speed, and regressing the turn too high caused the sled to become unstable and top-heavy seconds prior to it toppling onto its left side. The team did not start the fourth and final run.\n\nReal TV footage of the actual crash was used in the film but was heavily edited to fit in with the film's version of the crash. Both the run and the high speed crash were disorienting: team member Nelson Chris Stokes \"felt a bump\" when they tipped but did not realize they had turned over until he started to smell his helmet (which was fiberglass) friction-burning on the ice, \"which is something that stays with you for many years afterward.\"<ref>{{cite AV media |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZLQkCemE_Xs&watch_response |title=16x9 - Cool Runnings: Truth Behind Original Jamaican Bobsled Team |publisher=YouTube |date=June 6, 2012 |access-date=December 28, 2015}}</ref>\n\nAfter the crash, the film depicted the Jamaicans carrying their sled on their shoulders to the finish to a slow-building standing ovation. In reality, they did not carry the sled but walked next to it.

This was the case in the four-man sled competition, which the movie focuses on. However, in the two-man competition there was also a bobsled team from [[Netherlands Antilles]] which finished 29th (one place ahead of Jamaica's two-man sled team) and two teams from [[United States Virgin Islands]] which finished 35th and 38th.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2014/01/22/265060754/wow-dogecoin-other-donors-send-jamaican-bobsled-team-to-sochi |title=Online Donors Send Jamaican Bobsled Team To Sochi|publisher=NPR|date=January 22, 2014|access-date=February 3, 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe film focuses entirely on the four-man bobsled team, which crashed their sled and finished last out of the 26 teams, as all 25 other teams were able to complete all four runs. It ignores the fact that two members of the team (Dudley Stokes and Michael White) also competed in the two-man sled competition and successfully completed all four runs, finishing in 30th place out of 38 teams that finished all runs, with three other teams which did not finish. The remaining members of the four man sled team were Devon Harris and Chris Stokes (Dudley's younger brother).<ref>{{cite news |title= Bobsleigh at the 1988 Calgary Winter Games: Jamaica |website=Sports-reference.com |url= https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/countries/JAM/winter/1988/BOB |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20200417222135/https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/countries/JAM/winter/1988/BOB/ |url-status= dead |archive-date= April 17, 2020 |access-date=April 10, 2015}}</ref> In fact the whole formation of the bob-sleigh project as depicted in the film is incorrect.

They only decided to compete in the four-man event after having already completed the two-man event in Calgary.<ref name=\"real\" />\n\n===Other differences===\n\nIn the movie, the weather is depicted as bitterly cold with a temperature of {{convert|-25|\u00b0C}}.
