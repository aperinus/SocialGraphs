The film, originally released in Japan on August 6, 1994, was released theatrically in the United Kingdom, France, and Spain, and was adapted into English in [[dubbing (filmmaking)|dubbed]] and subtitled format by [[Animaze]] for [[Manga Entertainment]]. It was distributed by [[Toei Company]] in Japan, while [[20th Century Fox]] also distributed in other countries.\n\nThe film was a critical and commercial success. Group TAC later produced another loose adaptation of the ''Street Fighter II'' game, the anime series ''[[Street Fighter II V]]''. Though unrelated to the film, a handful of Animaze voice actors reprised their roles for their English dub of the series, produced after [[ADV Films]]'s dub.\n\nA [[live-action]] film, ''[[Street Fighter (1994 film)|Street Fighter]]'', was released on December 23, 1994, in the United States and May 6, 1995, in Japan by [[Universal Pictures]] and [[Columbia Pictures]].\n\n==Plot==\nIn the prologue, a fight between Japanese martial artist [[Ryu (Street Fighter)|Ryu]] and Muay Thai champion [[Sagat (Street Fighter)|Sagat]] rages until Ryu severely scars Sagat across the chest with a ''Shoryuken'', a rising uppercut attack that is empowered by [[qi|ki]] spiritual energy. Enraged, Sagat charges at Ryu. However Ryu claims victory by launching his Hadouken, a technique where he charges his ki power into his hands and is fired off in the form of a powerful energy blast. Sagat vows revenge.\n\nA couple of years later, following the assassination of a Justice Minister by [[Cammy White]], a hypnotized MI6 Agent, Interpol agent [[Chun-Li Zang]] suggests that they join forces with the [[United States Military]] to destroy the enigmatic crime syndicate known as [[Shadowlaw]]. Captain [[Guile (Street Fighter)|William Guile]], who is out for revenge against Shadowlaw's leader, [[M. Bison]], for the death of [[Charlie (Street Fighter)|his best friend]], initially refuses, but eventually relents when Chun-Li later tells him that Bison killed her father years ago and she herself wants revenge, but knows that her duty comes first. At the Shadowlaw base, Bison, along with his bodyguards [[Balrog (Street Fighter)|Balrog]], [[Vega (Street Fighter)|Vega]], and Sagat, orders a worldwide manhunt for Ryu, determined to induct him into his organization, and sends out hundreds of monitor cyborgs to find more valuable martial artists for their cause. However, Ryu, who is traveling the world to seek out worthy challengers, such as [[Fei-Long]], [[Dhalsim]], and [[Edmond Honda]], remains undetected due to suppressing his Ki.\n\nMeanwhile, Ryu's American best friend and fighting rival, [[Ken Masters]], has settled down with his girlfriend, Eliza, but still yearns for a good challenge and desires a rematch with Ryu. During a tussle with [[T. Hawk]], who had sought out Ken to challenge him, Ken is seen by a monitor cyborg and the footage of the fight is sent to the Shadowlaw base. Bison sees the footage and learns of Ken's history with Ryu, and decides to hunt him down and hypnotize him in Ryu's stead. Along the way, Bison sees Chun-Li and Guile warning [[Dee Jay]] about the monitor cyborgs and destroying one in the process, and subsequently sends Vega to New York to kill Chun-Li. Vega ambushes Chun-Li in her apartment, but after a bloody fight, Chun-Li kicks Vega through the wall of the building and he falls to his death, yet she is badly wounded and falls into a coma. Guile arrives and rushes her to the hospital. He also learns of Ryu and Ken from Interpol, and after learning that Bison has captured Ken, Guile rushes to Thailand to warn Ryu, who is training in the mountains with E. Honda.\n\nBison, however, follows Guile and confronts them. He sets the hypnotized Ken on Ryu, who initially refuses to fight back. Honda battles Balrog while Guile faces Bison and is severely beaten, though Bison spares his life as a final insult. As Ryu prepares to retaliate against Ken, memories of their past wreak havoc on Ken's mind and he manages to break free of Bison's mind control. The enraged Bison unleashes his Psycho Power upon Ken and casts him afar before turning his attention to Ryu, who fights Bison with very little success. Ken uses his master's Ki teachings to mend his body and joins the fight. With their combined forces, Ryu and Ken eventually pummel Bison into submission and hurl a joint ''Hadouken'' at him, apparently destroying him. Honda defeats Balrog and rescues both Guile and Balrog. Shortly afterwards, the United States Military locate and destroy the entrance to Bison's base, presumably arresting all of Bison's subordinates and bringing Shadowlaw down.\n\nChun-Li makes a full recovery and reunites with Guile in the hospital, informing him that their mission was a success. Elsewhere, Ryu and Ken part ways once again and Ryu begins his journey anew. However, he is ambushed from behind by a huge truck, with the driver revealed to be Bison, who survived the battle. The film closes as Ryu leaps towards the truck to fight Bison again.\n\nA [[Post-credits scene|post-credits message]] promotes a Japan Spring 1995 release for the ''[[Street Fighter (1994 film)|Street Fighter]]'' [[live-action]] film, starring [[Jean-Claude Van Damme]] and the late legendary [[Raul Julia]].\n\n==Voice cast==\n;Main\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The movie was released in the United Kingdom by [[Manga Entertainment]] UK under license from Capcom. Manga's UK release is censored in a similar way to the US version, yet profanity is retained and is rated 15 by the [[British Board of Film Classification|BBFC]]. Manga's Australian release is entirely uncut and is rated M by the [[Australian Classification Board|ACB]]. In addition, a slightly different version of the movie appears in both the [[PlayStation 2]] and [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]] versions of the ''[[Street Fighter Anniversary Collection]]'' as a bonus feature accessible from ''Hyper Street Fighter II''{{'}}s Gallery Mode. It is more censored than the PG-13 version in terms of language, and contains some other minor edits not related to mature or vulgar content. The American VHS releases and the version in the North American ''Street Fighter Anniversary Collection'' were [[pan and scan]] while the Region 1 DVD has non-anamorphic widescreen. The European VHS version is non-anamorphic widescreen. These localized English versions replaced the original Japanese soundtrack in favor of licensed, popular alternative, Western soundtracks from [[KMFDM]], [[Korn]], [[Alice in Chains]], [[Silverchair]], and other bands, as well an instrumental score.\n\n===2006 DVD version===\nAn ''Uncut, Uncensored, Unleashed'' DVD version of the movie was released in North America on July 18, 2006, and addresses the complaints made about the censored English versions of the film in 1995. Unlike the previous unrated version released in the US, which was still censored, this release is uncut from the original Japanese version and, for the first time (for non-Japanese releases of the movie), contains the original Japanese soundtrack in addition to the English soundtrack (both featuring a new Dolby Digital 5.1 mix). It is a double-sided DVD, with one side containing the English dub with the English soundtrack and the other side containing the original Japanese voices with the original Japanese soundtrack with optional English subtitles.\n\nThe video on the English and Japanese sides differ, though, with the Japanese side having a new, higher quality transfer from the original Japanese master. Like the original Japanese release and the UK release, the movie is presented in 1.85:1 non-anamorphic widescreen. The addition of Chun-Li's shower scene and a longer credit roll also makes the Japanese cut of the film longer by three minutes. The dubbed US and UK versions are still slightly cut.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://animeworld.com/reviews/streetfighter2movie.html |title=Street Fighter II: The Animated Movie : Anime Reviews : AAW |publisher=Animeworld.com |access-date=2012-08-19}}</ref> The English dubbed version has two instances of the word \"fuck\" in it.\n\nPrior to the 2016 Discotek release, the Australian release by [[Manga Entertainment|Manga]] & [[Madman Entertainment]] was the only version of the movie to date on either DVD or Blu-ray that is completely uncut outside Japan. At the time, Madman were not satisfied with the quality of any of the video masters available and instead created their own, using a transfer sourced from the original Japanese LaserDisc and applying both IVTC and DNR. The English dub on the disc is the original dub recorded by Manga Entertainment and Animaze, free from any editing of profanity and both English and Japanese dubs have been remixed into 5.1 audio. Easter eggs on the DVD contain three Japanese trailers for the movie as well as making available a version of the movie with the Japanese credits. The aspect ratio of the Australian release is an anamorphic 1.77:1.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.madman.com.au/catalogue/view/7198/street-fighter-ii-the-movie-uncut |title=Street Fighter II the Movie (Uncut) |publisher=Madman.com.au |access-date=2012-08-19}}</ref>\n\n===Netflix===\nAs part of their 2008 deal with [[Liberty Starz|Starz Entertainment]], [[Netflix]] made the film available for streaming.

The game was released exclusively in Japan for the [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] on December 15, 1995, and the [[Sega Saturn]] on March 15, 1996. Despite the similar title, it is unrelated to the arcade game ''[[Street Fighter: The Movie (arcade game)|Street Fighter: The Movie]]'', nor with the home console game of the [[Street Fighter: The Movie (home video game)|same name]], both based on the [[Street Fighter (1994 film)|live-action film]]. Although unreleased in America, the game was shown at the [[1995 in video gaming|1995]] [[Electronic Entertainment Expo]] under the title of ''Street Fighter II: The Interactive Movie''. A version for the [[3DO Interactive Multiplayer]] was also announced,<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Street Fighter: Animated |magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|issue=73|publisher=Sendai Publishing|date=August 1995|page=90}}</ref> but never released. The game consists of footage from the movie mixed with newly animated footage by Group TAC created specifically for the game (including an opening video).\n\nThe player takes control of a new type of monitor cyborg that has been secretly developed by Shadaloo. The objective of the game is to develop the Cyborg's abilities by analyzing the fighting techniques of martial artists around the world in order to gain enough strength to challenge Ryu in combat. The gameplay consists of watching [[full motion video|pre-rendered footage]] and analyzing them using the \"search\" command. For example, if the scene is shown which involves a character performing a kick technique, then the cyborg's kick abilities will increase by pointing and clicking on the character's kicks. On each stage, the player has a limited amount of time to analyze their surrounding as much as possible in order to gather the most data.\n\nWhile the majority of the game is strictly a [[life simulation]], the final battle between the Cyborg and Ryu is a one-on-one fighting segment that features the same game system as  ''[[Super Street Fighter II Turbo]]'' (including the presence of the Super Combo gauge). All of the Cyborg's acquired abilities can be put to use in battle. The Cyborg's special moves are the same ones used by Ken in ''Super Street Fighter II Turbo'', including his ''Sh\u014dry\u016b Reppa'' Super Combo.\n\nThe player can keep track of their Cyborg's development via a save file or through a passcode and test their Cyborg's current abilities against a virtual hologram of Ryu. This practice segments can also be played with a second player. The game also includes a database featuring information on the characters from the film.\n\n===Manga===\nA [[manga]] adaptation of the film was authored by Takayuki Sakai and serialized in the monthly ''[[CoroCoro Comic]]'' in 1994, later republished in a single [[tank\u014dbon]] collected edition. An English adaptation of this manga was published by [[Viz Media|Viz Communications]] as a six-issue comic book, released monthly from August 1995 to February 1996.\n\n==Legacy==\nThe movie served as the basis for ''[[Street Fighter Alpha]]''. Many elements and character designs were integrated into future games of the series (the ''Street Fighter Alpha'' series in particular). The film's final battle is loosely adapted into Ryu's story in ''[[Street Fighter Alpha 3]]'', where Ryu's sub-boss is a brainwashed Ken, whom he must defeat before facing Bison.\n\nThe film's success also led to the production of a television series, ''[[Street Fighter II V]]'', and another animated film, ''[[Street Fighter Alpha: The Animation]]''. While neither are set in the same continuity as the film, the Animaze English dubs featured a handful of actors reprising their roles from the film.\n\nThough it was preceded by ''[[Fatal Fury: The Motion Picture]]'' by one month, both movies' positive receptions also led to the production of several anime adaptations of different fighting video game series, such as ''[[Tekken: The Motion Picture]]'', ''[[Battle Arena Toshinden (anime)|Battle Arena Toshinden]]'', ''[[Night Warriors: Darkstalkers' Revenge (anime)|Night Warriors: Darkstalkers' Revenge]]'', and ''[[Samurai Shodown: The Motion Picture]]'', though none reached the same critical success.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Japan|Anime and manga|Film|1990s}}\n*''[[Street Fighter Alpha: The Animation]]''\n*''[[Street Fighter Alpha: Generations]]'' {{clear}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|0114563}}\n* {{Anime News Network|anime|2302}}\n* {{AllMovie title|154370}}\n* {{Rotten Tomatoes|street_fighter_ii_the_animated_movie_1996}}\n\n{{Street Fighter series}}\n{{Gisabur\u014d Sugii}}\n{{Group TAC}}\n\n[[Category:1994 anime films]]\n[[Category:1990s children's fantasy films]]\n[[Category:1990s Japanese-language films]]\n[[Category:Anime films based on video games]]\n[[Category:Discotek Media]]\n[[Category:Films about terrorism in Asia]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Gisabur\u014d Sugii]]\n[[Category:Films set in China]]\n[[Category:Films set in India]]\n[[Category:Films set in the Las Vegas Valley]]\n[[Category:Films set in London]]\n[[Category:Films set in Los Angeles]]\n[[Category:Films set in Seattle]]\n[[Category:Films set in Thailand]]\n[[Category:Group TAC]]\n[[Category:Japanese films set in New York City]]\n[[Category:Japanese martial arts films]]\n[[Category:Manga Entertainment]]\n[[Category:Street Fighter anime and manga]]\n[[Category:Street Fighter films]]"}]}}}}
