''Spotlight'' won the [[Academy Award for Best Picture]], along with [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay|Best Original Screenplay]], from six total nominations, making it the first Best Picture winner since ''[[The Greatest Show on Earth (film)|The Greatest Show on Earth]]'' (1952) to win only one other Oscar. The film also won the [[Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture]].\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1976, at a [[Boston Police Department|Boston Police]] station, two policemen discuss the arrest of [[Priesthood in the Catholic Church|Fr.]] [[John Geoghan]] for [[child molestation]]. A [[Monsignor|high-ranking cleric]] talks to the mother of the children. An [[District attorney#Assistant District Attorney|assistant district attorney]] then enters the precinct and tells the policemen not to let the press learn what has happened. The arrest is not publicized and Geoghan is released.\n\nIn 2001, [[Martin Baron|Marty Baron]], the new managing editor of ''[[The Boston Globe]]'', meets [[Walter V. Robinson|Walter \"Robby\" Robinson]], the editor of the newspaper's \"Spotlight\" [[Investigative journalism|investigative team]]. After Baron reads a ''Globe'' article about a lawyer, [[Mitchell Garabedian]], charging that [[Cardinal (Catholic Church)|Cardinal]] [[Bernard Francis Law|Bernard Law]], the [[Archbishop of Boston]], knew about Geoghan's [[child sexual abuse|sexual abuse]] of children and did nothing to stop it, Baron urges the Spotlight team to investigate. Journalist [[Michael Rezendes]] contacts Garabedian, who initially declines to be interviewed. Though he is told not to, Rezendes reveals that he is on the Spotlight team and convinces Garabedian to talk.\n\nInitially believing that they are following the story of one priest who was moved to new assignments several times, the Spotlight team begin to uncover a pattern of sexual abuse by other priests in [[Massachusetts]] and an ongoing cover-up by the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Boston|Boston Archdiocese]]. Through [[Phil Saviano]], who heads the victims' rights group [[Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests]] (SNAP), the team is led to widen their search to thirteen priests. [[Richard Sipe]], a former priest who worked to rehabilitate sexually abusive priests, tells them that his studies suggest that there are approximately 90 abusive priests in Boston (6% of priests). Through their research, the team develops a list of 87 names and begin to find victims to back up their suspicions.\n\nAs the team realizes the sheer scale of the investigation, it begins to take a toll on their lives: reporter Matt Carroll learns one of the priest rehabilitation centers is on the same block as his family's home but cannot tell his children or his neighbors to avoid spoiling the story; reporter [[Sacha Pfeiffer]] finds herself unable to attend church with her grandmother; Rezendes pushes to get the story out quickly to prevent further abuse; and Robinson faces pushback from some of his close friends who he learns were complicit in covering up the abuse.\n\nWhen the [[September 11 attacks]] occur, the team is forced to de-prioritize the story. They regain momentum when Rezendes learns from Garabedian that there are publicly available documents that confirm Cardinal Law was made aware of the abuse and ignored it. Although Rezendes argues vociferously to run the story immediately, before more victims suffer and rival newspapers publish comparable articles, Robinson steadfastly refuses, arguing the team needs to research further so that the systemic problem can be more fully exposed. After the ''Globe'' wins a case to have even more legal documents unsealed that provide the evidence of that larger picture, the Spotlight team finally begins to write the story and plan to publish their findings in early 2002.\n\nAs they are about to go to print, Robinson admits that he learned during the investigation that he was sent a list of 20 sexually abusive priests by lawyer [[Eric MacLeish]] in 1993, on which Robinson never followed up. Baron still commends Robinson and the Spotlight team's efforts to expose the crimes now. The story goes to print with a weblink to the documents that expose Law's inaction and a phone number for victims of abusive priests. The next morning, the team is inundated with calls from victims coming forward to tell their stories.\n\nA textual epilogue notes that Law resigned in December 2002 and was eventually promoted to the [[Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore]] in [[Rome]], and presents a list of 105 U.S. communities and 101 others around the world where major scandals involving abuse by priests have taken place.\n\n==Cast==\n===Spotlight team===\n* [[Mark Ruffalo]] as [[Michael Rezendes]]<ref name=\"ruffaloglobe\">{{cite web|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/lifestyle/names/2014/09/15/mark-ruffalo-visits-globe-seth-macfarlane-checks-out-improv-asylum/ngTrZ2cqwVFWfgVlhjCZgN/story.html |title=Mark Ruffalo visits the Globe |work=The Boston Globe |date=September 16, 2014 |first1=Mark |last1=Shanahan |first2=Meredith |last2=Goldstein |access-date=September 16, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/lifestyle/names/2014/08/10/report-globe-spotlight-movie-gets-cast/MtSpPdTpigOyHERKYr0zFL/story.html#comments |title=Report: Globe Spotlight movie gets a cast |work=The Boston Globe |date=August 11, 2014 |first1=Mark |last1=Shanahan |first2=Meredith |last2=Goldstein |access-date=September 25, 2014}}</ref>\n* [[Michael Keaton]] as [[Walter V.

When McCarthy was asked how he and his co-author tackled the research and writing process, he said:\n\n<blockquote>As I said, I passed [turned down the film] the first time! That's probably some indication of how intimidating it was. But I think, as always, with any big assignment, once you get over that initial shock and awe of how much material there was to cover, you start digging into the material and become really fascinated by and engaged with it, and we did. And yeah, it was a lot of work, but it was exciting work. It was really interesting work, parsing through details of not just the investigation, but its findings, and trying to determine what was most helpful in telling our story. I think having two brains on it was somewhat helpful too, because we could talk through it a lot. So it wasn't just sitting alone in a room and jotting notes. We were dialoguing a lot about it. That particular collaboration did feel investigative and on some level, seemed to parallel some of the collaboration of the reporters in that investigation. So, I think there was something about our collaboration that made that initial process more palatable on some level.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2016/02/spotlight-tom-mccarthy-interview-1201697317/|title='Spotlight's Tom McCarthy: \"I Passed The First Time\"|first=Antonia|last=Blyth|date=February 6, 2016|website=Deadline Hollywood}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n===Development===\nMcCarthy and Singer completed the script in June 2013.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/lifestyle/names/2014/08/18/spotlight-script-tells-story-globe-series/qzgm5dd7ztbZdMjT146VSI/story.html |title='Spotlight' script tells the story of Globe series |newspaper=The Boston Globe |date=August 19, 2014 |first1=Mark |last1=Shanahan |first2=Meredith |last2=Goldstein |access-date=September 27, 2014}}</ref> It was on the 2013 [[Black List (survey)|Black List]] of unproduced screenplays.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2013/12/2013-black-list-best-screenplays-full-list-653017/ |title=Black List 2013: Full Screenplay List |website=Deadline Hollywood |date=December 16, 2013 |access-date=January 6, 2015}}</ref> Singer told ''Creative Screenwriting'' that one of his goals for the film was to highlight the power of journalism, which he feels has been waning.

After the first story was published, Kurkjian rejoined the Spotlight team (he had been a founding member before becoming the ''Globe''<nowiki/>'s Washington bureau chief) to assist with further reporting on the abuses.
