The family builds a farm near a large, secluded forest and Katherine bears her fifth child, Samuel. One day, when Thomasin is playing [[peekaboo]] with Samuel, the baby abruptly disappears.

With their crops not growing sufficiently to harvest before winter, William takes Caleb to the woods to hunt for wild animals to eat. While hunting with his father, Caleb questions whether Samuel's unbaptized soul will reach [[Heaven]]. William discloses to Caleb that he traded Katherine's prized silver cup for hunting supplies in order to gather enough food for winter. That night, Katherine questions Thomasin about the disappearance of the cup and suspects her to be responsible for Samuel's disappearance. The children overhear their parents discussing how important Katherine\u2019s silver cup was (which is the only substitute if their crops continue to die), and the thought of sending Thomasin away to serve another family as she is reaching womanhood.\n\nLater, Thomasin finds Caleb at the stable preparing to check a [[Trapping|trap]] in the forest, and forces him to take her with him by threatening to awaken their parents. In the woods, they spot a [[hare]], which sends their horse into a panic. Their dog Fowler gives chase to the hare, and Caleb pursues them. The horse throws Thomasin, knocking her unconscious, and runs away. Caleb becomes lost in the woods and stumbles upon Fowler's disemboweled body. He then discovers a [[hut|hovel]], where the witch, disguised as a beautiful woman dressed in a red cape emerges to seduce him. She kisses and embraces Caleb, her arm growing old and withered as she caresses his head.\n\nWilliam finds Thomasin and takes her home, and Katherine angrily chastises her for taking Caleb into the woods. To defend his daughter, William reluctantly admits that he sold the cup. Later that night, as a storm rages, Thomasin discovers Caleb outside the home, naked, delirious, and mysteriously ill. The next day, the twins converse and sing songs with Black Phillip, the family's [[British Primitive goat|billy goat]], and accuse Thomasin of [[Christian views on witchcraft|witchcraft]]. Thomasin attempts to milk the [[nanny goat]], only to get blood. When Caleb awakens, he vomits up a whole apple with a single bite taken out of it. He convulses and screams as Katherine urges the family to [[Prayer|pray]]. The twins claim to forget the proper words to the prayer and become unresponsive. Caleb passionately proclaims his love for [[Jesus|Christ]] and dies.\n\nWilliam, believing Thomasin to be a witch, tells her she will be put on trial when the family returns to town. Thomasin points out William's own sins and accuses the twins in retaliation, as well as adding about the Devil takes the form of a billy goat and that Black Philip is [[Lucifer]]. Enraged and confused about the identity of the real culprit among the family, William seals his remaining children in the goat house. Thomasin denies being a witch, but the twins do not answer when she asks if they have truly spoken with Black Phillip. Thomasin overhears William breaking down and confessing to God that he has been [[pride]]ful, and that he made his family leave their village out of stubbornness rather than sincere religious devotion. Later in the night, the children awaken to see the witch drinking blood from the nanny goat, which turns to attack the twins. Meanwhile, Katherine has a [[hallucination|hallucinatory vision]] of Caleb holding Samuel. Caleb offers the baby to her and asks if she will look at a book. She chooses to breastfeed the baby, but it is actually a [[raven]] that pecks at her breast, leaving her bloody in the morning.\n\nWilliam awakens and finds the goat house destroyed, the goats [[disembowelment|eviscerated]], the twins missing, and an unconscious Thomasin lying nearby with bloodstained hands. As Thomasin awakens, Black Phillip gores and kills William before her eyes. An unhinged Katherine, now blaming Thomasin for the tragedies that have befallen the family and accusing her of seducing William and Caleb, attacks her. Thomasin kills her mother with a [[Billhook|bill hook]] in self-defense while crying.\n\nNow alone, Thomasin hears chiming and enters the [[stable]], where she urges Black Phillip to speak to her. The goat responds with a human voice, asking if she would like to \"live deliciously,\" in a life of luxury, and materializes into a [[Satan|tall, black-clad man]]. He tells Thomasin to remove her clothes and [[Deal with the Devil|sign her name in a book]] that appears before her. Thomasin follows Black Phillip into the forest nude, where she finds a [[coven]] holding a [[Witches' Sabbath]] around a [[bonfire]]. The witches begin to levitate, and Thomasin joins them, laughing maniacally and ascending above the trees, with her newfound sense of belonging.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Anya Taylor-Joy]] as Thomasin\n* [[Ralph Ineson]] as William\n* [[Kate Dickie]] as Katherine\n* Harvey Scrimshaw as Caleb\n* Ellie Grainger as Mercy\n* Lucas Dawson as Jonas\n* [[Julian Richings]] as The Governor\n* Bathsheba Garnett as The Witch (old) \n* [[Sarah Stephens]] as The Witch (young)\n* Charlie as Black Phillip (goat form)<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://hollywoodreporter.com/news/black-phillip-real-story-behind-871974 |title=Black Phillip: The Real Story Behind the Breakout Goat From 'The Witch' |date=March 2, 2016 |last=Abramovitch |first=Seth |magazine=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |access-date=February 12, 2017}}</ref>\n* [[Daniel Malik|Wahab Chaudhry]] as Black Phillip (voice, human form)\n* Axtun Henry Dube and Athan Conrad Dube as Samuel\n}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nEggers, who lived in New Hampshire, was inspired to write the film by his childhood fascination with [[witchcraft|witches]] and frequent visits to the [[Plimoth Plantation]] as a schoolboy.

[[scenography]].{{sfnp|Hart|2019|p=85}}{{sfnp|Parker|2020|p=180}} This is stylistically represented by the film's use of [[expressionist]] lighting, the use of different kinds of camera to draw thematic limits, the editing employed to hide horror from the main sight, and the soundtrack's sonic dissonance accompanying instrumental scenes.{{sfnp|Hart|2019|p=85-86}} Samuel's physically impossible disappearance at the beginning of the film introduces the viewer to the film's atmosphere.{{sfnp|Hart|2019|p=85}}\n[[File:Linda maestra.jpg|thumb|200px|''Linda maestra'' by [[Francisco de Goya]], 1799]]\nThe film's plot orbits around a psychological conflict, using a [[Sexual repression|repressive]], [[patriarchal]] portrayal of [[Puritan]] society and the dark, [[murder]]ous liberation of the witches.{{sfnp|Hart|2019|p=87}} The main female character, Thomasin, harbors worldly desires that differ from those of her conventionally Christian family,{{sfnp|Bacon|2019|p=77, 78}} yearning for [[independence]],{{sfnp|Hart|2019|p=87}}{{sfnp|Parker|2020|p=182}} [[sexuality]],{{sfnp|Fry|2019|p=173-174}} [[acceptance]]{{sfnp|Bacon|2019|p=76}}{{sfnp|Fry|2019|p=173-174}} and [[Power (social and political)|power]].{{sfnp|Bacon|2019|p=76}}{{sfnp|Fry|2019|p=173-174}} However, while her father and the [[Christian God]] fail to fulfill her needs, [[Satan]] instead speaks personally to her, offering her earthly satisfaction.{{sfnp|Bacon|2019|p=78}} Therefore, with the demise of her family and the rejection of the Puritan society, Thomasin joins Satan and the witches, her only alternative, in order to find her long desired control over her own life.{{sfnp|Fry|2019|p=174}} Her [[nudity]] in the last scene reflects her act of casting out the bonds of her previous society.{{sfnp|Parker|2020|p=182}}\n\nThe difference between both options, nevertheless, is rendered blurred in an evocation of equal [[religious extremism]].{{sfnp|Bacon|2019|p=76, 78-79}}{{sfnp|Fry|2019|p=173-174}} This is first felt in the architecture of the family's own home, which ironically resembles an archetypal witch's cottage itself, hinting the gradual reveal that evil is already installed in them.{{sfnp|Parker|2020|p=182}} On the opposite side, Satan's temptation of Thomasin also acquires traits of [[ideological]] [[Grooming (child abuse)|grooming]], slowly alienating her from her family.{{sfnp|Bacon|2019|p=76}}{{sfnp|Fry|2019|p=173}} At the end, despite her newfound cause and ecstatic laugh at the coven, Thomasin has not escaped her previous religiosity, but merely changed its direction, turning to murder in exchange for freedom.{{sfnp|Parker|2020|p=182}}{{sfnp|Bacon|2019|p=79}}\n\nThe symbolic conflict between [[civilization]] and [[nature]] is also present in all the aspects of the film.{{sfnp|Parker|2020|p=181}} The family lives next to a dark forest, a place tied to witchcraft in their culture, which underlines the conflict between their civilized, patriarchal religion and the [[Gothic fiction|Gothic]], wild natural world that surrounds them.{{sfnp|Parker|2020|p=181-183}} The forest, as well as the state of nudity,{{sfnp|Parker|2020|p=182}} are associated with monstrosity, with the untamed wilderness where the forbidden liberation and sexuality emerge.{{sfnp|Hart|2019|p=87}}{{sfnp|Parker|2020|p=181}}{{sfnp|Fry|2019|p=172}} Accordingly, Caleb returns nude after being seduced by the witch, the witches themselves perform their acts while [[Skyclad (Neopaganism)|naked]], and Thomasin eventually adopts this code upon joining them.{{sfnp|Parker|2020|p=182}} At the end of the film, nature triumphs over its adversary, with the [[Pan (god)|Pan]]-like Black Phillip goring the axe-wielding William in a metaphor of man being consumed by the wild.{{sfnp|Parker|2020|p=183}}\n\n==Release==\nThe film had its world premiere at the [[2015
