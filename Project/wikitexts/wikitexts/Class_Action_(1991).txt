[[Gene Hackman]] and [[Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio]] star; [[Laurence Fishburne|Larry Fishburne]], [[Colin Friels]], [[Fred Dalton Thompson]], and [[Donald Moffat]] are also featured. The film was entered into the [[17th Moscow International Film Festival]].<ref name=\"Moscow1991\">{{cite web|url=http://www.moscowfilmfestival.ru/miff34/eng/archives/?year=1991 |title=17th Moscow International Film Festival (1991) |accessdate=2013-03-03 |work=MIFF |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140403102003/http://www.moscowfilmfestival.ru/miff34/eng/archives/?year=1991 |archivedate=2014-04-03 }}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nThe story is about a [[lawsuit]] concerning injuries caused by a defective automobile. The suit takes on a personal dimension because the injured plaintiff's attorney, Jedediah Tucker Ward discovers that the automobile manufacturer's attorney is his estranged daughter Maggie Ward.\n\nJedediah Ward is a liberal [[civil rights]] lawyer who has based his career on helping people avoid being taken for a ride by the rich and powerful; he's pursued principle at the expense of profit, though he has a bad habit of not following up on his clients after their cases are settled.\n\nJed's daughter, Maggie, has had a bad relationship with her father ever since she discovered that he was cheating on her mother, Estelle, and while she also has made a career in law, she has taken a very different professional route by working for a high-powered corporate law firm and has adopted a self-interested political agenda.\n\nJed is hired to help field a lawsuit against ARGO, a major auto manufacturer, whose Meridian station wagons have a dangerous propensity to explode on impact when the left turn signal light is activated. While his research indicates that he has an all but airtight case against them, the case becomes more complicated for him when he discovers that Maggie is representing the firm he's suing.\n\nThe auto manufacturer in the film also utilizes a \"bean-counting\" approach to risk management, whereby the projections of actuaries for probable deaths and injured car-owners is weighed against the cost of re-tooling and re-manufacturing the car without the defect (exploding gas tanks) with the resulting decision to keep the car as-is to positively benefit short term profitability.\n\n==Cast==\n<!--- Cast and order per opening tombstone credits, roles per closing credits scroll --->\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Gene Hackman]] as Jedediah Tucker Ward\n* [[Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio]] as Maggie Ward\n* [[Colin Friels]] as Michael Grazier\n* [[Joanna Merlin]] as Estelle Ward\n* [[Laurence Fishburne]] as Nick Holbrook (credited as Larry Fishburne)\n* [[Donald Moffat]] as Quinn\n* [[Jan Rube\u0161|Jan Rubes]] as Pavel\n* [[Matt Clark (actor)|Matt Clark]] as Judge Symes\n* [[Fred Thompson|Fred Dalton Thompson]] as Dr. Getchell\n* [[Jonathan Silverman]] as Brian\n}}\n\n==Production notes==\nThe central premise of the film is roughly analogous to the controversy surrounding the [[Ford Pinto]] and its [[Ford Pinto#Fuel system fires, recalls, and litigation|fuel tank design]]. A 1977 article in ''[[Mother Jones (magazine)|Mother Jones]]'' alleged Ford was aware of the design flaw, refused to pay for a redesign, and decided it would be cheaper to pay off possible lawsuits. The magazine obtained a [[cost-benefit analysis]] that it said Ford had used to compare the cost of repairs (Ford estimated the cost to be $11 per car) against the cost of settlements for deaths, injuries, and vehicle burnouts.  The memo in question was actually prepared by Ford in response to a NHTSA request for comment, it reviewed not Ford but the entire new car market and was not used to make product decisions at Ford.<ref name=LeeErmann>{{cite journal|last1=Lee|first1=Matthew T|last2=Ermann|first2=M.
