The film is the first installment in [[Maze Runner (film series)|''The Maze Runner'' film series]] and was produced by [[Ellen Goldsmith-Vein]], [[Wyck Godfrey]], Marty Bowen, and Lee Stollman with a screenplay by [[Noah Oppenheim]], Grant Pierce Myers, and [[T.S. Nowlin]]. The film stars [[Dylan O'Brien]], [[Kaya Scodelario]], [[Aml Ameen]], [[Thomas Brodie-Sangster]], [[Ki Hong Lee]], [[Will Poulter]], and [[Patricia Clarkson]]. The story follows sixteen-year-old Thomas, portrayed by O'Brien, who awakens in a rusty elevator with no memory of who he is, only to learn that he has been delivered to the middle of an intricate maze, along with many other boys, who have been trying to find their way out of the ever-changing labyrinth{{snd}}all while establishing a functioning society in what they call the Glade.\n\nDevelopment of ''The Maze Runner'' began in January 2011 when [[20th Century Fox|Fox]] purchased the film rights to Dashner's novel with [[Gotham Group]], [[Temple Hill Entertainment]], [[TSG Entertainment]] as producers and [[Catherine Hardwicke]] intended to direct. In 2012, Ball was hired to direct the film adaptation after presenting a [[3D film|3D]] [[computer animation|computer-animated]] short film titled ''Ruin'' with a similar tone and was initially considered for a feature-length adaptation. [[Principal photography]] began in [[Baton Rouge, Louisiana]] on May 13, 2013 and officially concluded on July 12, 2013.\n\n''The Maze Runner'' was released on September 19, 2014, in the United States by [[20th Century Fox]]. The film received positive reviews, with praise for the performances and tone. Critics considered it to be better than most young adult book-to-film adaptations. The film was first at the box office in its opening weekend, grossing $32.5{{nbsp}}million, making it the seventh-highest-grossing debut in September. The film earned over $348{{nbsp}}million worldwide at the box office, against its budget of $34{{nbsp}}million. A sequel, ''[[Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials]]'', was released on September 18, 2015, in the United States. A third and final film, ''[[Maze Runner: The Death Cure]]'', was released on January 26, 2018.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Please read [[WP:FILMPLOT]] before expanding the plot. Film plots should be between 400 and 700 words long. -->\nA teenage boy wakes up inside an underground elevator with no memory of his identity, and greeted by several male youths in a large grass area, called the \"Glade,\" enclosed by tall stone walls. The \"Gladers\" have formed a rudimentary society, and each assumes specialized tasks. The boy learns that a vast Maze surrounding them is the only way out. During the day, designated Runners search the Maze for an escape route and return before nightfall when the entrance closes. After a competitive fight with Gally, the boy remembers his name is Thomas. The next day, he is attacked by Ben, a Runner who has been stung and left delirious by a Griever, one of the techno-organic creatures that roam the Maze at night. Ben is forced into the Maze and left to die as a direct consequence of his actions, along with there being no cure for his condition. Alby, the leader, and Minho, the lead Runner, later retrace Ben's steps inside the Maze the following morning. Minho reappears late in the afternoon dragging Alby, who has been stung, but are unable to reach the closing entrance in time. Thomas runs into the Maze to help, which leaves all three trapped. Thomas lures a Griever into a closing passageway, which causes it to be crushed. The three manage to survive the night and return the next morning.\n\nA girl arrives in the elevator, with a note saying that she is the last one to enter the Glade, and recognizes Thomas, but he cannot remember her. Thomas, Minho, Frypan, Winston, and Zart enter the Maze, locate the Griever corpse, and remove a beeping mechanical device from inside it. Gally claims that Thomas has jeopardized the fragile peace between the Gladers and the Grievers, and wants him punished. However, Newt, the group's second-in-command, instead designates Thomas as a Runner. Minho shows Thomas a hand-constructed model of the Maze that is based on previous explorations. The Maze's numbered sections open and close in a regular sequence and Thomas realizes that the device corresponds to a section of the Maze.\n\nThe girl, Teresa, has two syringes filled with an unknown substance. One is used on Alby, and he recovers from the Griever sting. Minho and Thomas venture back into the Maze with the device and discover a possible exit. Several traps are activated, forcing Thomas and Minho to leave. That night, the Maze entrance does not close, and others open, allowing the Grievers to enter. Alby, Zart, Clint, and several others die and Gally blames Thomas for the events. Thomas, who has been having disconnected memory flashes since his arrival, stabs himself with a severed Griever stinger in an attempt to revive his memory before he is injected with the last anti-venom. Unconscious, he recalls that he and Teresa worked for the organization that created the Maze, WCKD, and the boys unknowingly have been test subjects for an experiment. Thomas awakens and confesses that he and Teresa worked with WCKD and studied the boys for years.\n\nMeanwhile, Gally has taken command and intends to sacrifice Thomas and Teresa to the Grievers to restore peace. However, several Gladers free them and enter the Maze, but Gally and a few others refuse to leave. As they attempt to access a possible exit, Jeff and several other Gladers are killed by Grievers. The Gladers eventually enter a laboratory strewn with corpses. In a video recording, Ava Paige, a WCKD official, explains that the planet has been devastated by a massive [[solar flare]], followed by a pandemic of a deadly virus, the Flare. The group learns that they were part of an experiment intended to develop a cure. Paige is seen shooting herself in the video as the lab is overtaken by armed men. Gally, having been stung by a Griever, appears, insists that they will never be free, and points a gun at Thomas. Minho impales Gally in the chest with a spear, but he fatally shoots Chuck. While Thomas mourns over Chuck, masked armed men then rush in and take the group to a helicopter. It flies over a vast desert wasteland and approaches a ruined city.\n\nLater, the supposedly dead scientists meet in a room. Paige notes that the experiment has been successful and the survivors are now entering [[Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials|Phase Two]].\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Dylan O'Brien]] as Thomas, the last male to enter the Glade\n* [[Kaya Scodelario]] as Teresa, the only female to ever enter the Glade, as well as the last Glader\n* [[Aml Ameen]] as Alby, the first to enter the Glade and the leader of the Gladers\n* [[Thomas Brodie-Sangster]] as Newt, second-in-command of the Gladers\n* [[Ki Hong Lee]] as Minho, the keeper of the runners\n* [[Will Poulter]] as Gally, the keeper of the builders\n* [[Patricia Clarkson]] as Ava Paige, the head of WCKD\n* [[Blake Cooper]] as Chuck, a very young Glader\n* [[Dexter Darden]] as Frypan, the cook\n* [[Jacob Latimore]] as Jeff\n* [[Chris Sheffield]] as Ben, a runner\n* [[Joe Adler]] as Zart\n* Randall D.

Barthelmey created a test design that he presented to director Wes Ball. Impressed by Barthelmey's work, Ball asked him to add a mechanical scorpion tail to the design. Barthelmey used various animal inspirations to come up with the design, including coconut crabs, caterpillars and piranhas. Besides the Grievers, Barthelmey also worked on several Maze, Beetle Blade (cut from the film) and Crank designs.<ref name=\"The Maze Runner\"/>\n\n===Casting===\nFor the role of Teresa, [[Kaya Scodelario]] was Ball's first choice as she was \"fantastic\" and because he loved her in the TV show ''Skins''. [[Dylan O'Brien]], the lead role, was initially rejected by Ball. Ball recounts, \"Dylan was actually... I saw him early on, very early on and I overlooked him. It was a big learning experience there because I overlooked him because of his hair. He had ''[[Teen Wolf (2011 TV series)|Teen Wolf]]'' hair and I couldn't see past that and so we were looking for our Thomas and it's a tough role to make because he comes in as a boy and he leaves as a man, so it can't be like this badass action star that comes into this movie. It's about vulnerability upfront and then he comes out of it and comes into his own and then the next movies are about the leader that emerges from the group. So finally Fox says 'We just did this movie, ''The Internship''. There's this kid that's in this thing. He's like 20 years old. We think he's kind of got something.' So I watched his tape and was like 'Wait a minute, I've seen this kid before.' I looked him up online and there was one picture of him with a totally shaved head and it's this sweet vulnerable-looking kid and I was like 'Whoa, interesting.' I said, 'Wait a minute, he's just so familiar and I looked back at my old audition tapes, which we had thousands of, and there's Dylan. That guy I said 'No, definitely not him.' So we brought him back in and we started to talk with him and I'm like 'he's the coolest dude ever.'\" [[Blake Cooper]] entered the film via [[Twitter]]. Ball revealed a lot on Twitter, and many kids wanted to be Chuck. Cooper constantly bugged Ball, until Ball told him to give his tape to his casting director, and Ball was impressed by Cooper's tape and cast him.<ref name=\"collider.com\" />\n\n===Filming===\n[[Principal photography]] started in [[Baton Rouge, Louisiana]] on May 13, 2013,<ref>{{cite web |title=Maze Runner Movie Set |url=http://jamesdashner.com/maze-runner-movie-set/ |work=jamesdashner.com |access-date=September 12, 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140924132426/http://jamesdashner.com/maze-runner-movie-set/ |archive-date=September 24, 2014 |df=mdy-all}}</ref> and officially ended on July 12, 2013.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Maze Runner Movie Release Date, News, and Updates: 2 New Clips Released in Anticipation of The Premiere |url=http://www.hallels.com/articles/3972/20140820/maze-runner-movie-release-date-news-updates-2-new-clips.htm |work=hallels.com |access-date=September 12, 2014}}</ref> Post-production on the film was completed in June 2014.\n\n===Soundtrack===\n{{Infobox album\n| name       = The Maze Runner\n| type       = soundtrack\n| artist     = [[John Paesano]]\n| cover      =\n| alt        =\n| released   = September 16, 2014\n| recorded   = 2014\n| venue      =\n| studio     =\n| genre      =\n| length     = 1:03:08\n| label      = [[Sony Classical]]\n| producer   = [[John Paesano]]\n| chronology = ''Maze Runner'' film series soundtrack\n| prev_title =\n| prev_year  =\n| next_title =\n| next_year  =\n}}\nComposed by [[John Paesano]], the soundtrack consists of 21 tracks and was released on September 16, 2014.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/the-maze-runner-original-motion-picture-soundtrack-mw0002710196 |title=The Maze Runner [Original Motion Picture Soundtrack] |work=[[AllMusic]] |access-date=March 4, 2016}}</ref>\n{{-}}\n\n==Release==\nThe film was originally set to be released on February 14, 2014.<ref name=\"ReleaseDate\">{{cite web |last=Fleming |first=Mike |title=Tweets Lead Blake Cooper To ''Maze Runner'' Role |url=https://deadline.com/2013/04/tweets-lead-blake-cooper-to-maze-runner-role-482123/ |date=April 23, 2013 |access-date=May 25, 2016 |work=Deadline}}</ref> On October 5, 2013, the film was pushed back.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.comingsoon.net/news/movienews.php?id=109817 |title=Fault in Our Stars Gets Release Date, Maze Runner Pushed Back - ComingSoon.net |date=October 5, 2013}}</ref> [[IMAX]] theaters released the film on September 19, 2014.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Vlessing |first1=Etan |title=Imax to Release Fox's ''The Maze Runner'' |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/imax-release-foxs-maze-runner-728059 |access-date=August 27, 2014 |work=The Hollywood Reporter |date=August 26, 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Marketing===\n[[File: Kaya Scodelario & Dylan O'Brien (14781570315).jpg|thumb|right|[[Kaya Scodelario]] and [[Dylan O'Brien]] at a panel for the film at [[San Diego Comic-Con]] International in July 2014]]\nEleven character cards for the film were released in July 2013.
