The screenplay, by [[Ruth Prawer Jhabvala]], is a semi-[[fiction]]al account of [[Thomas Jefferson]]'s tenure as the [[Ambassadors of the United States|Ambassador of the United States]] to [[France]] before his [[presidency]] and of his alleged relationships with British [[artist]] [[Maria Cosway]] and his [[Slavery|slave]], [[Sally Hemings]].\n\nThe film was critically and commercially unsuccessful, grossing $5.9 million on a $14 million budget.\n\n==Plot==\nSet in the period 1784\u20131789, the film portrays Jefferson when he was US minister to France at [[Palace of Versailles|Versailles]] before the [[French Revolution]]. French liberals and intellectuals hope he will lead them away from the corruption of the court of [[Louis XVI|King Louis XVI]] and [[Marie-Antoinette]] and toward a more democratic form of government. Although deploring the poverty of the common people, he embraces the riches of French culture and civilization. It is his first time abroad, and he takes advantage of the opportunity to extend his knowledge of liberal arts and science while absorbing the refinements France has to offer.\n\nA lonely widower, Jefferson develops a close friendship with [[Maria Cosway]], a beautiful (and married) Anglo-Italian painter and musician. Although she becomes increasingly devoted to him, he is attached to his memory of his late wife, to whom he promised that he would not remarry, and to his two younger daughters. His elder daughter is especially possessive, and [[Patsy Jefferson|Patsy]] becomes jealous of Maria's influence on her father. Maria becomes his confidant and correspondent, with their personal relationship becoming more affectionate as well.\n\nLater, Jefferson becomes attracted to [[Sally Hemings]], his enslaved maid and companion of his younger daughter Polly. Three-quarters white in ancestry, she is his late wife's half-sister. Their father had taken Sally's slave mother as a [[concubine]] after he was widowed for the third time; Sally is the sixth of their children. Sally's enslaved brother James Hemings is also in [[Paris]], learning to be a French chef for Jefferson at [[Monticello]]. When [[George Washington]] offers Jefferson the post of [[Secretary of State]], he accepts and prepares to sail home with his family.\n\nBut James, having enjoyed his freedom in Paris, is unwilling to return to the United States and urges Sally to remain with him. It is only when Jefferson promises, making an oath upon the Bible, that he will give James and Sally their freedom that they consent to return with him. Sally is also pregnant with Jefferson's child, and Jefferson extends his oath to promise freedom to all of Sally's children as well.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Photo de Nick Nolte.jpg|thumb|[[Nick Nolte]] as [[Thomas Jefferson]].]]\n\n===''At Jefferson's house, the H\u00f4tel de Langeac''===\n*[[Nick Nolte]] .....

The biggest problem with [the film] is at the basic editing level, with such abrupt jumps between diverse scenes that the film's momentum remains choppy. Overshadowed by its own ambition and not-quite-ironic pageantry, ''Jefferson in Paris'' doesn't quite come to life ... Casting Nick Nolte as a Founding Father may sound like this film's riskiest choice, but in fact it makes solid sense. Beyond having the right physical stature for the imposing, sandy-haired Jefferson, Mr. Nolte captures the man's vigor and his stiff sense of propriety. He may not adapt effortlessly to the role of an intellectual giant, but his performance is thoroughly creditable ... The film makers fare less successfully with Maria Cosway ... Ms. Scacchi, the film's big casting problem, makes her so bloodless and prettily artificial that the romance never seems real. There's much more spice in Ms. Newton's captivating performance as Sally Hemings, even if she gives this teen-age slave girl the unexpected fiddle-dee-dee flirtatiousness of a [[Scarlett O'Hara]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/31/movies/film-review-jefferson-s-entanglements-in-history-and-in-love.html|title=FILM REVIEW; Jefferson's Entanglements, In History And in Love|first=Janet|last=Maslin|newspaper=The New York Times |date=31 March 1995 }}</ref></blockquote>\n\n[[Roger Ebert]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' observed in a less positive review of the film that,\n\n<blockquote>The film is lavishly produced and visually splendid, like all the Merchant-Ivory productions. But what is it about? Revolution? History? Slavery? Romance? No doubt a lot of research and speculation went into Jhabvala's screenplay, but I wish she had finally decided to jump one way or the other. The movie tells no clear story and has no clear ideas.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19950407/REVIEWS/504070307/1023|title=Jefferson In Paris Movie Review (1995) - Roger Ebert|first=Roger|last=Ebert|website=rogerebert.suntimes.com}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn a negative review appearing in ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine, [[Peter Travers]] said,\n\n<blockquote>After a literate and entertaining roll (''[[A Room with a View (1986 film)|A Room With a View]]'', ''[[Howards End (film)|Howards End]]'', ''[[The Remains of the Day (film)|The Remains of the Day]]''), the team of producer Ismail Merchant, director James Ivory and writer Ruth Prawer Jhabvala drops the ball with this droopy, snail-paced prigs-in-wigs movie. It doesn't help that Nick Nolte is such a lox as Thomas Jefferson ...

Things happen ... but they don't weave and dovetail in the surprising, intricate and telling ways they can in first-class fiction, some of Merchant Ivory's recent films included ... The strong points of director James Ivory's approach here are his attentiveness to wonderful detail ... The downside is that Ivory's reticence makes it additionally tough for an emotionally remote figure like Jefferson to come alive onscreen.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.variety.com/review/VE1117903874.html?categoryid=31&cs=1&p=0|title=''Variety'' review}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n===Box office===\nThe film grossed $61,349 in its opening weekend from just two screens.
