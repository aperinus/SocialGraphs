The French title is derived from the [[Charles Baudelaire#Edgar Allan Poe|first collection]] of [[Edgar Allan Poe]]'s short stories translated by French poet [[Charles Baudelaire]]; the English titles ''Spirits of the Dead'' and ''Tales of Mystery and Imagination'' are respectively taken from an 1827 [[Poems by Edgar Allan Poe#Spirits of the Dead (1827)|poem]] by Poe and a 1902 [[Tales of Mystery & Imagination|British collection]] of his stories.\n\n[[American International Pictures]] distributed this horror [[anthology film]] featuring three Poe stories directed by European directors [[Roger Vadim]], [[Louis Malle]] and [[Federico Fellini]]. The cast includes [[Jane Fonda]], [[Alain Delon]], [[Peter Fonda]], [[Brigitte Bardot]], and [[Terence Stamp]]. The English-language version features narration by [[Vincent Price]].<ref>Hughes, p.92f</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n===\"Metzengerstein\"===\nAt the age of 22, Countess Fr\u00e9d\u00e9rique inherits the Metzengerstein estate and lives a life of promiscuity and debauchery. While in the forest, her leg is caught in a trap and she is freed by her cousin and neighbour Baron Wilhelm, whom she has never met because of a long-standing family [[feud]]. She becomes enamoured with Wilhelm, but he rejects her for her wicked ways. His rejection infuriates Fr\u00e9d\u00e9rique and she sets his stables on fire. Wilhelm is killed attempting to save his prized [[horse]]s.\n\nOne black horse somehow escapes and makes its way to the Metzengerstein castle. The horse is very wild and Fr\u00e9d\u00e9rique takes it upon herself to tame it. She notices at one point that a damaged [[tapestry]] depicts a horse eerily similar to the one that she has just taken in. Becoming obsessed with it, she orders its repair. During a [[thunderstorm]], Fr\u00e9d\u00e9rique is carried off by the spooked horse into a fire caused by [[lightning]] that has struck.\n\n===\"William Wilson\"===\nIn the early 19th century when [[Northern Italy]] is under [[Austria]]n rule, an army officer named William Wilson rushes to [[Confession (religion)|confess]] to a [[priest]] (in a church of the \"Citt\u00e0 alta\" of [[Bergamo]]) that he has committed [[murder]]. Wilson then relates the story of his cruel ways throughout his life. After playing cards all night against the courtesan Giuseppina, his ''[[doppelg\u00e4nger]]'', also named William Wilson, convinces people that Wilson has cheated. In a rage, the protagonist Wilson stabs the other to death with a dagger. After making his confession, Wilson commits [[suicide]] by jumping from the tower of \"Palazzo della Ragione\", but when seen his corpse is transfixed by the same dagger.\n\n===\"Toby Dammit\"===\nFormer [[Shakespeare]]an actor Toby Dammit is losing his acting career to alcoholism. He agrees to work on a film, to be shot in Rome, for which he will be given a brand new [[Ferrari]] as a bonus incentive. Dammit begins to have unexpected visions of a macabre girl with a white ball. While at a film award ceremony, he gets drunk and appears to be slowly losing his mind.  A stunning woman comforts him, saying she will always be at his side if he chooses. Dammit is forced to make a speech, then leaves and takes delivery of his promised Ferrari. He races around the city, where he sees what appear to be fake people in the streets. Lost outside of Rome, Dammit eventually crashes into a work zone and comes to a stop before the site of a collapsed bridge. Across the ravine, he sees a vision of the little girl with a ball (whom he has earlier identified, in a TV interview, as his idea of the Devil). He gets into his car and speeds toward the void. The Ferrari disappears, and we then see a view of roadway with a thick wire across it, dripping with blood, suggesting Dammit has been decapitated. The girl from his vision picks up his severed head and the sun rises.\n\n==Cast==\nCredits primarily adapted from ''Italian Gothic Horror Films, 1957\u20131969'' and ''Midnight Movie Monographs: Spirits of the Dead (Histoires Extraordinaires)''.{{sfn|Curti|2015|p=184}}{{sfn|Lucas|2018|p=45, 98, 139-140}}\n;\"Metzengerstein\"\n{{div col}}\n*[[Jane Fonda]] as Countess Fr\u00e9d\u00e9rique de Metzengerstein\n*[[Peter Fonda]] as Baron Wilhelm Berlifitzing\n*[[Serge Marquand]] as Hugues\n*[[Georges Douking]] as the Upholsterer\n*[[Philippe Lemaire]] as Philippe\n*Carla Marlier as Claude\n*[[James Robertson Justice]] as a Marquis{{sfn|Lucas|2018|p=55}}\n*[[Fran\u00e7oise Pr\u00e9vost (actress)|Fran\u00e7oise Pr\u00e9vost]] as a Courtesan\n*Marie-Ange Ani\u00e8s as a Courtesan\n''Uncredited:''\n*[[Dennis Berry]] as a Courtier\n*Jackie Blanchot as a Courtier\n*Audoin de Bardot as the Page\n*[[Anny Duperey]] as a Courtesan\n*[[Andr\u00e9as Voutsinas]] as a Courtier\n*[[Maurice Ronet]] as the Narrator {{small|(French version)}}\n*Clement Biddle Wood as the Narrator {{small|(English version)}}\n{{div col end}}\nDespite receiving prominent billing in both the film and advertising materials, most of Justice and Pr\u00e9vost's performances appears to have been cut from the final print of the film.{{sfn|Curti|2015|p=184}}{{sfn|Lucas|2018|p=45}}\n;\"William Wilson\"\n{{div col}}\n*[[Alain Delon]] as William Wilson\n**Marco Stefanelli as Wilson as a boy\n*[[Brigitte Bardot]] as Guiseppina Ditterheim<ref name=\"BFI\"/> {{small|(Josephine in the English version)}}\n*Katia Christine as the Blonde Girl\n*[[Renzo Palmer]] as the Priest\n*[[Umberto D'Orsi]] as Hans\n*[[Daniele Vargas]] as the University Professor\n''Uncredited:''\n*Paolo Giusti as Wilson's Double\n**Massimo Ard\u00f9 as Wilson's Double as a boy<ref name=\"BFI\">{{cite web|url=https://www2.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b72736a77|website=[[BFI]]|access-date=23 October 2022|title= Histoires extraordinaires (1967)}}</ref>\n*Andrea Esterhazy as Officer at Casino\n*[[John Karlsen]] as Military School Instructor\n*[[Franco Arcalli]] as the Teacher who beats Wilson{{sfn|Lucas|2018|p=106}}\n{{div col end}}\n;\"Toby Dammit\"\n{{div col}}\n*[[Terence Stamp]] as Toby Dammit\n*Marina Yaru as The Devil\n*[[Salvo Randone]] as Father Spagna\n*Annie Tonietti as the TV Commentator\n*Monica Pardo as Miki, the Curly-Haired Actress\n''Uncredited:''\n*Antoni Pietrosi as \"La Signora\"\n*[[Federico Boido]] as Toby's Body Double\n*Marisa Traversi as Maril\u00f9 Traversi {{small|(Maril\u00f9 Lolo in the French version)}}\n*[[Ferdinand Guillaume]] as the Old Blind Actor\n*Fabrizo Angeli as Maurizio Manetti\n*[[Ernesto Colli]] as Ernestino Manetti\n*Aleardo Ward as First TV Interviewer\n*Paul Cooper as Second TV Interviewer\n*[[Milena Vukotic]] as Third TV Interviewer\n*Nella Gambini as Elizabeth\n*Andrea Fantasia as the Producer\n*Campanella as Lombardi, the Assistant Producer\n*Brigitte as the Old Blind Actor's Aide\n*Irina Maleeva as a Gypsy Fortune Teller\n*Giovanni Tarallo as an Old Paparazzo\n*Fides Stagni as Herself\n{{div col end}}\n[[Van Heflin]] appeared in a deleted scene in which he plays an actor in ''Trente dollari'', the [[Spaghetti Western]] that Toby is cast in.{{sfn|Lucas|2018|p=178}}\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Edgar Allan Poe crop.jpg|thumbnail|''Spirits of the Dead'' was based on the work of [[Edgar Allan Poe]].]]\n\n===Development===\nOmnibus films were popular in Europe in the 1960s so producers [[Alberto Grimaldi]] and [[Raymond Eger]] developed the idea of film anthology influenced by the work of [[Edgar Allan Poe]].{{sfn|Curti|2015|p=184}}{{sfn|Curti|2015|p=186}}<ref name=\"tcm\">{{cite web|first=Jeff|last=Stafford|url=http://www.tcm.com/this-month/article.html?isPreview=&id=499693%7C208678&name=Spirits-of-the-Dead|title=Spirits of the Dead|website=Turner Classic Movids}}</ref>\n\nInitial directors announced to work on the film included [[Luchino Visconti]], [[Claude Chabrol]], [[Joseph Losey]] and [[Orson Welles]].{{sfn|Curti|2015|p=186}} [[Orson Welles]] would direct one segment based on both \"[[Masque of the Red Death]]\" and \"[[The Cask of Amontillado]]\".

Scriptwriter and novelist [[Terry Southern]], who had worked on the screenplay for ''Barbarella'', travelled to [[Rome]] with Vadim and according to Southern's biographer Lee Hill, it was during the making of this segment that Peter Fonda told Southern of his idea to make a 'modern Western' movie. Southern was enthusiastic about the idea and agreed to work on the project, which eventually became the renowned independent film ''[[Easy Rider]]''.<ref>Lee Hill \u2013 ''A Grand Guy: The Life and Art of Terry Southern'' (Bloomsbury, 2001)</ref>{{Page needed|date=February 2017}} The segment was filmed in Roscoff, a small town in Brittany.<ref name=\"tcm\"/>\n\nLouis Malle accepted the job of directing the segment \"William Wilson\" in order to raise money for his next film ''[[Murmur of the Heart]]''. The financial process of raising money for ''Murmur'' took him three years after completing \"William Wilson\" and in the meantime he shot two documentaries about India. Malle stated that he did not consider his collaboration in ''Histoires Extraordinaires'' a very personal one and that he agreed to make some compromises with the producer, [[Raymond Eger]], in order to make the film more attractive to mainstream spectators. Malle's original conception of the film was closer to Poe\u2019s tale than the final result. The most important changes were: casting [[Brigitte Bardot]] in the role of Giuseppina with the purpose of adding some erotic touches to the film, the inclusion of the dissection scene, and a somewhat explicit use of violence in some scenes.<ref>Mena Jos\u00e9 Luis and Cuesta Javier \u2013 Diccionario de Cine (Edimat, 2004)</ref>{{Page needed|date=February 2017}} Malle did not enjoy working with Delon. He wanted [[Florinda Bolkan]] for the female lead but the producers insisted on someone more well known, like Bardot. Bardot agreed to make the film; Malle thought she was miscast.<ref name=\"tcm\"/>\n\n[[Federico Fellini]] directed the segment \"Toby Dammit\" which he wrote with [[Bernardino Zapponi]].{{sfn|Curti|2015|p=184}} Zapponi had a love for gothic literature which can be seen in his short story collection ''Gobal'' (1967) where he attempted to re-shape the genre into a contemporary setting.{{sfn|Curti|2015|p=185}} Zapponi's stories caught Fellini's attention.{{sfn|Curti|2015|p=185}} Fellini was particularly interested in ''C'\u00e8 una voce nella mia vita'' ('There is a voice in my life'), which was his first choice in adapting into a film for ''Spirits of the Dead''.{{sfn|Curti|2015|p=185}}{{sfn|Curti|2015|p=186}} The producers were reluctant to have Zapponi's name on the film, so Fellini changed his mind and returned to Poe for inspiration.{{sfn|Curti|2015|p=186}} Fellini considered \"[[A Predicament (short story)|The Scythe of Time]]\" and \"[[The Premature Burial|'The Premature Burial]]\", but eventually chose \"[[Never Bet the Devil Your Head]]\".{{sfn|Curti|2015|p=186}} Zapponi and Fellini only used the ending of the story in their adaptation of the material.{{sfn|Curti|2015|p=186}} The film has thematic similarities to three earlier Fellini films. The disintegrating protagonist and the hellish celebrity demimonde he inhabits are reminiscent of both ''[[La Dolce Vita]]'' and ''[[8\u00bd]],'' while the interweaving of dreams and hallucinations into the plotline and the use of highly artificial art direction to reflect inner states resemble similar techniques used in ''[[8\u00bd]]'' and ''[[Juliet of the Spirits]]''.<ref name=\"Fellini's Forgotten Masterpiece 2007\">George Porcari \u2013 ''Fellini's Forgotten Masterpiece: Toby Dammit'' (CineAction Magazine, January 2007)</ref> Fellini rejected Poe's version of the devil, a lame old gentleman with his hair parted in front like a girl\u2019s, and cast a 22 year old Russian woman (Marina Yaru) to play the devil as a young girl. Lending a \"pedophiliac slant\"<ref>Kezich, Tullio (2006). ''Fellini: His Life and Work'' (New York: Faber and Faber), 284.</ref> to Toby's character, Fellini explained that \"a man with a black cape and a beard was the wrong kind of devil for a drugged, hipped actor. His devil must be his own immaturity, hence, a child.\"<ref>Alpert, Hollis (1988).

Reviewing the picture under its English language title ''Spirits of the Dead,'' Vincent Canby of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote that \"''Toby Dammit,'' the first new Fellini to be seen here since ''[[Juliet of the Spirits]]'' in 1965, is marvellous: a short movie but a major one.
