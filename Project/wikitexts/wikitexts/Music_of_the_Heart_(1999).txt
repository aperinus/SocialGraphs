The film is a dramatization of the true story of [[Roberta Guaspari]], portrayed by [[Meryl Streep]], who co-founded the Opus 118 Harlem School of Music and fought for music education funding in New York City public schools. The film also stars [[Aidan Quinn]], [[Gloria Estefan]] (in her film debut), and [[Angela Bassett]]. It was director Craven's first and only mainstream cinematic film not in the [[horror film|horror]] or [[thriller film|thriller]] genre, and also his only film to receive [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] nominations.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 to 700 words. -->\nIn 1981 New York City, [[Roberta Guaspari]], a recently divorced violinist, lives with her two sons, Alexi and Nicholas Tzavaras, and her mother, Assunta Guaspari. With Assunta's encouragement, Guaspari attempts to rebuild her life and is recommended to the head teacher of [[East Harlem]]'s Central Park East School. Despite having little experience in actual music teaching, she accepts a substitute violin teaching position at Central Park East. With a combination of her toughness and determination, she inspires a group of children, and their initially skeptical parents. The program slowly develops and attracts publicity, eventually expanding to Central Park East II and River East Schools.\n\nTen years later, the Central Park East, Central Park East II and River East School string programs work with the [[New York City Board of Education]] to help eliminate funding for the programs, which leads to Guaspari's early dismissal. Determined to fight the budget cuts, she enlists the support of former pupils, parents and teachers and plans a [[benefit concert]], Fiddlefest, to raise money so that the program can continue. But with a few weeks to go and all participants furiously rehearsing, they lose the venue. However, [[Arnold Steinhardt]], the husband of a publicist friend, is a violinist in the [[Guarneri Quartet]], and he enlists the support of other well-known musicians, including [[Isaac Stern]] and [[Itzhak Perlman]]. They arrange for the concert to be mounted at [[Carnegie Hall]].\n\nOn the day of Fiddlefest, Guaspari and her students perform with Perlman, Steinhardt, Stern, [[Mark O'Connor]], [[Michael Tree]], Charles Veal Jr., [[Karen Briggs (musician)|Karen Briggs]], Sandra Park, Diane Monroe, and [[Joshua Bell]], increasing donations and making the event a massive success.\n\nIn the epilogue, descriptions show Guaspari and the Opus 118 program's activities after the events in 1991.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Meryl Streep]] as [[Roberta Guaspari]]\n*[[Aidan Quinn]] as Brian Turner, Roberta's love interest\n*[[Angela Bassett]] as Janet Williams, school principal\n*[[Gloria Estefan]] as Isabel Vasquez, a teacher\n*[[Cloris Leachman]] as [[Roberta Guaspari|Assunta Vitali Guaspari]], Roberta's mother\n*[[Josh Pais]] as Dennis Rausch\n*[[Jane Leeves]] as Dorothea von Haeften, a wealthy socialite \n*[[Kieran Culkin]] as Alexi Tzavaras, Roberta's son\n*[[Michael Angarano]] as Nick Tzavaras, Roberta's son\n*[[Jay O.

After seeing ''Small Wonders'', Wes Craven, known for his work on horror films, was inspired to make a full-length film about Guaspari. [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] was originally signed to play the role of Guaspari, but left the project before filming began, citing \"creative differences\" with Craven. When she left, Madonna had already studied for many months to play the violin.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1999-10-16/news/9910160182_1_violin-roberta-guaspari-meryl-streep | first=Bonnie | last=Churchill | title=Streep Takes Violin Immersion Course For Role In 'Music Of The Heart' | newspaper=[[Chicago Tribune]] | date=October 16, 1999}}</ref> Streep learned to play [[Concerto for Two Violins (Bach)|Bach's Concerto for 2 Violins]] for the film.\n\nThe film marked the screen debut of singer [[Gloria Estefan]].<ref name=\"CNNRev\">[http://www.cnn.com/SHOWBIZ/Movies/9910/28/review.musicofheart/ \"Review: 'Music of the Heart' hits all the right notes\"] CNN, October 29, 1999.

Here you might think she has no accent, unless you've heard her real speaking voice; then you realize that Guaspari's speaking style is no less a particular achievement than Streep's other accents. This is not Streep's voice, but someone else's - with a certain flat quality, as if later education and refinement came after a somewhat unsophisticated childhood.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19991029/REVIEWS/910290302/1023|title=Music Of The Heart Movie Review (1999) - Roger Ebert|first=Roger|last=Ebert|website=rogerebert.suntimes.com|access-date=18 August 2017}}</ref> Steve Rosen said that \"The key to Meryl Streep's fine performance is that she makes Guaspari unheroically ordinary.
