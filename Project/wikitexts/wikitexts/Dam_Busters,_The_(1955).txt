It was directed by [[Michael Anderson (director)|Michael Anderson]]. The film recreates the true story of [[Operation Chastise]] when in 1943 the [[Royal Air Force|RAF's]] [[No. 617 Squadron RAF|617 Squadron]] attacked the [[M\u00f6hne Reservoir|M\u00f6hne]], [[Edersee Dam|Eder]], and [[Sorpe Dam|Sorpe]] dams in [[Nazi Germany]] with [[Barnes Wallis]]'s ''[[bouncing bomb]]''.\n\nThe film was based on the books ''[[The Dam Busters (book)|The Dam Busters]]'' (1951) by [[Paul Brickhill]] and ''[[Enemy Coast Ahead]]'' (1946) by [[Guy Gibson]]. The film's reflective last minutes convey the poignant mix of emotions felt by the characters \u2013 triumph over striking a successful blow against the enemy's industrial base is tempered by the sobering knowledge that many died in the process of delivering it.\n\nThe film was widely praised and became the most popular motion picture at British cinemas in 1955.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article205384431 |title=R.A.F.

Working for the [[Minister of Aircraft Production|Ministry of Aircraft Production]], as well as his own job at [[Vickers-Armstrongs|Vickers]], he works feverishly to make practical his theory of a [[bouncing bomb]] which would skip over the water to avoid protective [[torpedo nets]]. When it hit the dam, backspin would make it sink whilst retaining contact with the wall, making the explosion far more destructive. Wallis calculates that the aircraft will have to fly extremely low ({{convert|150|ft|m}}) to enable the bombs to skip over the water correctly, but when he takes his conclusions to the Ministry, he is told that lack of production capacity means they cannot go ahead with his proposals.\n\nAngry and frustrated, Wallis secures an interview with [[Arthur Travers Harris|Sir Arthur \"Bomber\" Harris]] (played by [[Basil Sydney]]), the head of [[RAF Bomber Command]], who at first is reluctant to take the idea seriously. Eventually, however, he is convinced and takes the idea to the [[Winston Churchill|Prime Minister]], who authorises the project.\n\nBomber Command forms a special squadron of [[Avro Lancaster|Lancaster]] bombers, 617 Squadron, to be commanded by [[Wing commander (rank)|Wing Commander]] Guy Gibson, and tasked to fly the mission. He recruits experienced crews, especially those with low-altitude flight experience. While they train for the mission, Wallis continues his development of the bomb but has problems, such as the bomb breaking apart upon hitting the water. This requires the drop altitude to be reduced to {{convert|60|ft|m}}. With only a few weeks to go, he succeeds in fixing the problems and the mission can go ahead.\n\nThe bombers attack the dams. Eight Lancasters and their crews are lost, but two dams are breached and the overall mission succeeds. Wallis later encounters Gibson, clearly affected by the loss of the crewmen, but Gibson stresses the squadron knew what they were facing but they went in regardless of the odds. Before they part Wallis asks if Gibson will finally get some sleep. Gibson says he cannot; he has to write letters to the dead airmen's next of kin.\n\n==Cast==\n[[Image:Dam Busters Gibson.jpg|thumb|225px|[[Richard Todd]] as [[Guy Gibson]] in ''The Dam Busters'' (1955)]]\n[[Image:Dam Busters Redgrave.jpg|thumb|[[Michael Redgrave]] as [[Barnes Wallis]] in ''The Dam Busters'' (1955)]]\nIn credits order.\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Richard Todd]] as Wing Commander  [[Guy Gibson]], CO of 617 Squadron and pilot of \"George\"\n* [[Michael Redgrave]] as [[Barnes Wallis]], assistant chief designer, Aviation Section, Vickers-Armstrong Ltd\n* [[Ursula Jeans]] as Mrs Molly Wallis\n* [[Basil Sydney]] as Air Chief Marshal  [[Sir Arthur Harris, 1st Baronet|Sir Arthur Harris]], [[General officer commanding|GOC-in-C]], RAF Bomber Command\n* [[Patrick Barr]] as Captain [[Joseph Summers|Joseph \"Mutt\" Summers]], Chief Test Pilot, Vickers-Armstrong Ltd\n* [[Ernest Clark]] as Air Vice-Marshal [[Ralph Cochrane]], AOC, No. 5 Group RAF\n* [[Derek Farr]] as Group Captain [[John Whitworth (RAF officer)|John Whitworth]], station commander, [[RAF Scampton]]\n* [[Charles Carson (actor)|Charles Carson]] as Doctor\n* Stanley Van Beers as [[David Randall Pye|David Pye]], director of scientific research, Air Ministry\n* [[Colin Tapley]] as [[William Glanville|Dr William Glanville]], director of Road Research, Department of Scientific and Industrial Research\n* [[Frederick Leister]] as committee member\n* Eric Messiter as committee member\n* [[Laidman Browne]] as committee member\n* [[Raymond Huntley]] as National Physical Laboratory Official\n* [[Hugh Manning]] as Ministry of Aircraft Production Official\n* [[Edwin Styles]] as Observer at Trials\n* [[Hugh Moxey]] as Observer at Trials\n* Anthony Shaw as RAF Officer at Trials\n* [[Laurence Naismith]] as Farmer\n* [[Harold Siddons]] as Group Signals Officer\n* Frank Phillips as BBC Announcer\n* [[Brewster Mason]] as Flight Lieutenant Richard Trevor-Roper, rear gunner of \"George\"\n* Anthony Doonan as Flight Lieutenant Robert Hutchison, wireless operator of \"George\"\n* [[Nigel Stock (actor)|Nigel Stock]] as Flying Officer Frederick Spafford, bomb aimer of \"George\"\n* [[Brian Nissen]] as Flight Lieutenant Torger Taerum, navigator of \"George\"\n* [[Robert Shaw (actor)|Robert Shaw]] as Flight Sergeant John Pulford, flight engineer of \"George\"\n* Peter Assinder as Pilot Officer Andrew Deering, front gunner of \"George\"\n* [[Richard Leech]] as [[Dinghy Young|Squadron Leader Melvin \"Dinghy\" Young]], pilot of \"Apple\"\n* [[Richard Thorp]] as Squadron Leader [[Henry Eric Maudslay|Henry Maudslay]], pilot of \"Zebra\"\n* [[John Fraser (actor)|John Fraser]] as Flight Lieutenant [[John Vere Hopgood|John Hopgood]], pilot of \"Mother\"\n* [[David Morrell (actor)|David Morrell]] as Flight Lieutenant Bill Astell, pilot of \"Baker\"\n* [[Bill Kerr]] as [[Harold Brownlow Martin|Flight Lieutenant H.

The company's production manager was, however, of the opinion that, due to its numerous personnel and raids, it would not be able to film the book in its entirety. As a result, Clark requested that Brickhill provide a film treatment which described his vision for the film. Brickhill agreed to do it without payment in the hope of selling the film rights. To assist him, Clark teamed him up with [[Walter C. Mycroft|Walter Mycroft]] who was the company's director of production.<ref>Dando-Collins. p. 237.</ref> Brickhill decided to concentrate the film treatment on Operation Chastise and ignore the later raids.\n\nAfter the Air Ministry agreed to make available four Lancaster bombers at a cheap price which helped make the production viable, Associated British decided to proceed with the film and agreed with Brickhill on the film rights in December 1952 for what is believed to have been \u00a35,000.<ref>Dando-Collins. p. 241.</ref> After considering [[C. S. Forester|C.S. Forester]], [[Terence Rattigan]], as well as [[Emlyn Williams]] and [[Leslie Arliss]], [[R. C. Sherriff]] was selected as the screenwriter with planned August delivery of the screenplay.<ref>Dando-Collins. p. 243.</ref> Sherriff agreed with Brickhill's opinion that the film needed to concentrate on Operation Chastise and exclude the later operations covered in the book.\n\nIn preparation for writing the script, Sherriff met with Barnes Wallis at his home, later returning accompanied by Brickhill, Walter Mycroft and production supervisor W.A. \"Bill\" Whittaker on 22 March 1952 to witness Wallis demonstrating his original home experiment. To Wallis's embarrassment he couldn't get it to work, no matter how many times he tried.<ref>Dando-Collins. p. 245.</ref>\n\nJust prior to the film's scheduled release, Guy Gibson's widow Eve took legal action to prevent it, and Brickhill and Clark were mired in months of wrangling with her until references to her husband's book ''Enemy Coast Ahead'' were included.\n\n==Production==\nThe flight sequences of the film were shot using real [[Avro Lancaster]] bombers supplied by the RAF. The aircraft, four of the final production B.VIIs, had to be taken out of storage and specially modified by removing the mid-upper [[gun turret]]s to mimic 617 Squadron's special aircraft, and cost \u00a3130 per hour to run, which amounted to a tenth of the film's costs. A number of [[Avro Lincoln]] bombers were also used as \"set dressing\".<ref>Garbettt and Goulding 1971, pp. 142\u2013143.</ref> (An American cut was made more dramatic by depicting an aircraft flying into a hill and exploding.

Guy Gibson had been based at Hemswell in his final posting and the airfield had been an operational Avro Lancaster base during the war. At the time filming took place it was then home to [[No. 109 Squadron RAF|No. 109 Squadron]] and [[No. 139 Squadron RAF]], which were both operating [[English Electric Canberra]]s on electronic countermeasures and nuclear air sampling missions over hydrogen bomb test sites in the Pacific and Australia. However, part of the RAF's fleet of ageing Avro Lincolns had been mothballed at Hemswell prior to being broken up and several of these static aircraft appeared in background shots during filming, doubling for additional No 617 Squadron Lancasters. The station headquarters building still stands on what is now an industrial estate and is named Gibson House.

ITV blamed regional broadcaster [[London Weekend Television]], which in turn alleged that a junior staff member had been responsible for the unauthorised cuts. When ITV again showed a censored version in June 2001, it was condemned by the ''[[Index on Censorship]]'' as \"unnecessary and ridiculous\" and because the edits introduced continuity errors.<ref>Milmo, Dan.

The original, uncensored, version was also shown on 1 and 5 January 2013, by [[Channel 5 (UK)|Channel 5]]. It was the version, distributed by [[StudioCanal]], containing shots of the bomber flying into a hill.\n\nIn 2020, [[Film 4]] broadcast an edited version, possibly re-dubbed in a few places, where the dog's name is removed, addressed as \"old boy\" or referred to as \"my dog\".\n\n==Historical accuracy==\n\n[[Image:Dam Busters bombadier.jpg|thumb|right|275px|A bomb aimer prepares to drop his bouncing bomb using an improvised device to determine the correct distance from the dam.]]\n\nThe film is largely historically accurate, with only a small number of changes made for reasons of [[Artistic license|dramatic licence]]. Some errors derive from Paul Brickhill's book, which was written when much detail about the raid was not yet in the public domain.\n* [[Barnes Wallis]] said that he never encountered any opposition from bureaucracy. In the film, when a reluctant official asks what he can possibly say to the RAF to persuade them to lend a [[Vickers Wellington]] bomber for flight testing the bomb, Wallis suggests: \"Well, if you told them that I designed it, do you think that might help?\" Barnes Wallis was heavily involved with the design of the Wellington, as it used his [[geodetic airframe]] construction method, though he was not actually its chief designer.\n* Instead of all of Gibson's tour-expired crew at [[No. 106 Squadron RAF|106 Squadron]] volunteering to follow him to his new command, only his wireless operator, Hutchinson, went with him to 617 Squadron.\n* Rather than the purpose as well as the method of the raid being Wallis's sole idea, the dams had already been identified as an important target by the [[Air Ministry]] before the war.\n* Gibson did not devise the ''[[searchlight|spotlights]] [[altimeter]]'' after visiting a theatre; it was suggested by [[Benjamin Lockspeiser]] of the Ministry of Aircraft Production after Gibson requested they solve the problem. It was a proven method used by [[RAF Coastal Command]] aircraft for some time.<ref>[http://www.culture24.org.uk/history+%2526+heritage/war+%2526+conflict/world+war+two/art71384 \"National Archives reveals inglorious truth behind classic World War Two movies.\"] ''culture24.org.uk'', 2 September 2009.

This scene, which is not in the original version, was included in the copy released on the North American market (see above).

This version of the weapon was never used operationally.\n* At the time the film was made, certain aspects of Upkeep were still held classified, so the actual test footage was censored to hide any details of the test bombs (a black dot was superimposed over the bomb on each frame), and the dummy bombs carried by the Lancasters were almost spherical but with flat sides rather than the true cylindrical shape.\n* The dummy bomb did not show the mechanism which created the back spin.\n* Ammunition shown being loaded into a Lancaster is [[.50 BMG|.50 calibre]] for [[M2 Browning]] heavy machine guns, not that for the .303 calibre machine guns found on the Lancaster in 1943.\n* The scenes of the attack on the Eder Dam show a castle resembling Schloss Waldeck on the wrong side of the lake and dam. The position and angle of the lake in relation to the castle suggest that in reality the bombing-run would have needed a downhill approach to the west of the castle.\n* Wallis states that his idea came from [[Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson|Nelson's]] bouncing cannonballs into the sides of enemy ships. (He also states that Nelson sank one ship during the [[Battle of the Nile]] with a ''[[yorker]]'', a cricket term for a ball that bounces under the bat, making it difficult to play.) There is no evidence for this claim. In a 1942 paper, Wallis mentioned the bouncing of cannonballs in the 16th and 17th centuries, but Nelson was not mentioned.<ref name=\"Murray, I.R. 2009\">Murray, Iain.
