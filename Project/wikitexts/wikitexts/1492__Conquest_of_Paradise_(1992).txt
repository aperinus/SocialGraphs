It portrays a version of the travels to the [[New World]] by the Genovese-Castillian explorer [[Christopher Columbus]] and the effect this had on [[indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous peoples]].\n\nThe film was released to celebrate the [[Columbus Quincentenary|500th anniversary]] of Columbus' voyage.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Mathews |first=Jack |date=3 May 1992 |title=MOVIES : Voyage of Rediscovery : With '1492,' director Ridley Scott and writer Roselyne Bosch aim to portray Christopher Columbus not as a legend but as an extraordinary though flawed person |work=Los Angeles Times |url=https://articles.latimes.com/1992-05-03/entertainment/ca-2005_1_christopher-columbus |access-date=9 October 2010}}</ref> The premiere debuted less than two months after ''[[Christopher Columbus: The Discovery]]'' by [[John Glen (director)|John Glen]], often leading to confusion between the two films. The film received mixed to negative reviews, with particular criticism aimed at the film's historical inaccuracies.\n\n==Plot==\n{{See also|Voyages of Christopher Columbus}}\nAware that the world is round, [[Christopher Columbus]] lobbies for a trip westwards to Asia, but lacks a crew and ship. The Catholic theologians at the [[University of Salamanca]] heavily disapprove of Columbus's plan, not being keen on ideas that go against the writings of [[Ptolemaeus]]. Columbus is approached by [[Mart\u00edn Pinz\u00f3n]], a shipowner from [[Palos de la Frontera|Palos]], who introduces him to the banker [[Luis de Sant\u00e1ngel|Sant\u00e1ngel]], to whom [[Queen Isabella I]] owes money. Columbus meets with the queen, who grants him his journey in exchange for his promise to bring back sufficient amounts of riches in gold.\n\nColumbus deceives many crewmen by telling them that the voyage will only last seven weeks. Three ships depart. Nine weeks go by with no sign of land. The crew becomes restless and edges toward [[mutiny]]. He tries to reinvigorate them with an inspiring speech, coinciding with a fast wind, which goads the men to return to their duties. At night, Columbus notices mosquitoes on the deck, indicating that land is not far off. Suddenly, out of the mist they see the lush vegetation and sandy beaches of [[Guanahani]].\n\nThe Europeans befriend the local natives, who show them gold they have collected. Columbus teaches one of them Spanish so that they are able to communicate. He then informs them that he will return to Spain, which will be followed by the arrival of many more Europeans. Columbus leaves behind a group to begin the [[colonisation of the Americas]]. Back in Spain, he receives a high honour from the queen and has dinner with the council. They express disappointment with the small amount of gold he brought back, but the queen approves of his gifts. On the second expedition, Columbus takes 17 ships and over 1,000 men with him to the island; however, all the crewmen left behind are found to have been killed. When the tribe is confronted by Columbus and his troops, they tell him that another tribe came and killed them. Columbus chooses to believe them, but his commanding officer [[Adri\u00e1n de Moxica|Moxica]] is not convinced. They begin to build the city of [[La Isabela]] and eventually manage to hoist the town bell into its tower.\n\nFour years later, the natives are being forced to mine for gold. Moxica punishes one who fails to find any gold by cutting off his hand. The word of this act of violence spreads throughout the native tribes and they all disappear into the forest. Columbus begins to worry about a potential war, with the natives heavily outnumbering them. Upon return to his home, he finds his house set ablaze by Moxica and his followers, confirming his unpopularity among a certain faction of the settlers. Soon, the tribes arrive to fight the Spaniards and the island becomes war-torn, with Columbus' governorship being reassigned with orders for him to return to Spain.\n\nColumbus is accused of nepotism and offering administrative positions to his personal friends, thereby injuring the pride of the nobles such as Moxica; he is replaced by [[Francisco de Bobadilla|de Bobadilla]]. Columbus returns to Castile to be imprisoned, but is bailed out by his sons. When he is summoned by the queen, she is reluctantly convinced to allow him to make another voyage, with the proviso that he neither take his brothers nor return to the colonies. As an old man, Columbus is virtually forgotten in Spain, with the discovery of the [[New World]] being credited to [[Amerigo Vespucci]]. Columbus's son [[Ferdinand Columbus|Ferdinand]] asks his father to tell him his story so he can transcribe it.\n\n==Cast==\n{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n* [[G\u00e9rard Depardieu]] as [[Christopher Columbus]]\n* [[Armand Assante]] as Gabriel S\u00e1nchez, Columbus's archrival in Castile\n* [[Sigourney Weaver]] as [[Isabella I of Castile|Queen Isabella I]]\n* [[Loren Dean]] as Older [[Ferdinand Columbus]]\n* [[\u00c1ngela Molina]] as [[Beatriz Enr\u00edquez de Arana]]\n* [[Fernando Rey]] as Antonio de Marchena\n* [[Michael Wincott]] as [[Adri\u00e1n de Moxica]], Columbus's archenemy in the Indies\n* [[Tch\u00e9ky Karyo]] as [[Mart\u00edn Alonso Pinz\u00f3n]]\n* [[Kevin Dunn]] as Captain M\u00e9ndez\n* [[Frank Langella]] as [[Luis de Sant\u00e1ngel]]\n* [[Mark Margolis]] as [[Francisco de Bobadilla]]\n* [[Kario Salem]] as de Arojaz\n* Billy L.

Its main theme, \"[[Conquest of Paradise (song)|Conquest of Paradise]]\", was used by former [[List of Prime Ministers of Portugal|Portuguese Prime-Minister]] [[Ant\u00f3nio Guterres]] at his 1995 election and it was used by the [[Socialist Party (Portugal)|Portuguese Socialist Party]] as its campaign and rally anthem,<ref>[http://estremoznet.blogspot.pt/2013/07/conquista-do-paraiso.html Conquista do Para\u00edso], Hern\u00e2ni Matos, blog ''Estremoz Net'', 24 July 2013 (Portuguese)</ref><ref>[https://vozdoseven2.blogs.sapo.pt/717215.html A Conquista do Para\u00edso], neves, aj, 19 August 2010, blog ''Voz do Seven 2'' (Portuguese)</ref><ref>[Da avalia\u00e7\u00e3o de Passos Coelho], cbs, blog ''La force des choses'', 10 April 2011 (Portuguese)</ref> although it was replaced by the main theme from ''[[Gladiator (2000 film)|Gladiator]]'' (curiously another Ridley Scott film) since the first Jos\u00e9 S\u00f3crates legislative elections campaign,<ref>[http://a-espera-de-godot.blogspot.pt/2011/09/bandas-sonoras.html Bandas Sonoras], blog ''\u00c0 Espera de Godot'', 13 September 2011 (Portuguese)</ref> which doesn't prevent the theme from still being deeply associated with the Socialist Party.<ref>[http://scriptoriumciberico.blogspot.pt/ Da avalia\u00e7\u00e3o de Passos Coelho], cbs, blog ''La force des choses'', 10 April 2011 (Portuguese)</ref>\n\nRussia used it in the 2nd round of the [[1996 Russian presidential election]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=\u041a\u0410\u0428\u0418\u041d |url=https://t.me/kashinguru/36151 |website=Telegram}}</ref>{{Clarify|date=August 2022}}\n\nThe theme is also used at the starting line of the ''[[Ultra-Trail du Mont-Blanc]]'' ultramarathon. The German boxer [[Henry Maske]] (former world champion ([[IBF]]) in the [[Light heavyweight]] category) used the main theme as his official entry theme during his professional career. Other usages of the theme include New Zealand [[Super Rugby|Super 15 Rugby]] franchise the [[Canterbury Crusaders]], as they run onto the field, often accompanied by actors dressed as knights and riding on horseback, and [[rugby league]] team [[Wigan Warriors]] who play in the [[Super League]], as well as being played before the start of every match in the 2010 and 2014 cricket [[ICC World Twenty20|World Twenty20]] championships as well as the [[2011 ICC Cricket World Cup|2011 Cricket World Cup]]. In these events the theme was played right before the national anthems of the two competing nations, as the flags of the two nations were carried into the ground, accompanied by the players of the two teams. The theme was also played in the ''[[Top Gear: US Special]]'' and became a signature piece for World Professional Champion figure skaters Anita Hartshorn and Frank Sweiding. Despite the film's dismal box office intake in the United States, the film's score became a successful album worldwide.\n\n==Reception==\n===Box office===\n''1492: Conquest of Paradise'' opened on 66 screens in Spain, grossing $1 million in its first five days.<ref name=open/> In the United States and Canada, it was released by [[Paramount Pictures]] on 9 October 1992 in 1,008 theaters.
