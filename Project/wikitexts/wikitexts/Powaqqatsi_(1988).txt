It is the second film in the [[Qatsi trilogy]].\n\n''Powaqqatsi'' is a [[Hopi language|Hopi]] [[neologism]] coined by Reggio meaning \"parasitic way of life\" or \"life in transition\". While ''Koyaanisqatsi'' focused on modern life in industrial countries, ''Powaqqatsi'', which similarly has no dialogue, focuses more on the conflict in [[Third World]] countries between traditional ways of life and the new ways of life introduced with industrialization.<ref>[https://philipglass.com/compositions/powaqqatsi/ Powaqqatsi - Philip Glass]</ref> As with ''Koyaanisqatsi'' and the third and final part of the 'Qatsi' trilogy, ''[[Naqoyqatsi]]'', the film is strongly related to its soundtrack, written by [[Philip Glass]].\n\n==Synopsis==\n[[File:Powaqqatsi Definition Still Screenshot.png|thumb|upright|Screenshot from the end of the film]]\nIn the beginning chapter, ''Serra Pelada'', men from [[Serra Pelada]] (a gold mine in Brazil) are seen carrying bags of dirt up to a destination. In the middle of the chapter, various shots outside of Serra Pelada are shown. Near the end of the chapter, a few men are carrying another man who was struck by a falling rock (mentioned in the \"Impact of Progress\" feature on the DVD/Blu-ray) uphill along a procession of workers who are carrying dirt-filled sacks. After that, several discordant layered exposures of the dirt carriers are shown. The scene cross fades to show the image of a head, with multiple exposures of the same head rapidly rotating and layered upon to give a manifold appearance. This is an apparent allusion to [[Janus]], the god of beginnings, endings and transitions, keeping with the film's central themes of progress and change.\n\nIn ''Anthem: Part 1'', the sun rises up above an African village. Later, a man raises a sail for a boat. The next chapter, ''That Place'', starts zooming out from a waterfall. Children can be heard laughing. Villages are shown as well as children and upside down water reflections. ''Anthem: Part 2'' has various shots of villages and islands shown.\n\n''Mosque and Temple'' shows various natural shots as well as religious scenes. Some of these scenes are a transparent inside a church with someone walking by, a man praying, a monk sitting while a bird flies off his stick, the same monk walking by the river, a bird flying by a sunset, more children, crows flying above a river, two men rowing their boat in that river, a woman praying in the [[Ganges]] river, two men practicing [[yoga]], another monk, and a temple in [[Nepal]].\n\n''Anthem: Part 3'' shows masses of people in motion, working together and celebrating traditional rituals, in Africa and South America, all in slow-motion.\n\n''Video Dream'' blends together colorful television advertisements and news programs from the US,<ref>[https://harvardfilmarchive.org/calendar/powaqqatsi-2019-09 Harvard Film Archive]</ref> Western Europe, the Soviet Union and Japan.\n\n''New Cities In Ancient Lands'' has views of people on the move, and traffic in three parts: China, Africa and India.\n\n''The Unutterable/Caught!'' People in large groups in the developing world, moving together, at work; views of traffic from above.\n\n''Mr. Suso / From Egypt'' Sometimes-unfocused people in motion, to the muezzin's call, ghostly double-images of traffic, close-ups of faces, reflections in water.\n\n== Music ==\nA soundtrack was produced in 1988 that was composed by Philip Glass.{{Track listing\n| headline = Powaqqatsi: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack (1988)\n| title1 = Serra Pelada\n| length1 = 5:00\n| title2 = The Title\n| length2 = 0:25\n| title3 = Anthem: Part 1\n| length3 = 6:22\n| title4 = That Place\n| length4 = 4:41\n| title5 = Anthem: Part 2\n| length5 = 3:49\n| title6 = Mosque and Temple\n| length6 = 4:42\n| title7 = Anthem: Part 3\n| length7 = 8:11\n| title8 = Train to S\u00e3o Paulo\n| length8 = 3:04\n| title9 = Video Dream\n| length9 = 2:14\n| title10 = New Cities In Ancient Lands: China\n| length10 = 2:47\n| title11 = New Cities In Ancient Lands: Africa\n| length11 = 2:56\n| title12 = New Cities In Ancient Lands: India\n| length12 = 4:42\n| title13 = The Unutterable\n| length13 = 7:02\n| title14 = Caught!\n| length14 = 7:20\n| title15 = Mr. Suso #1\n| length15 = 1:08\n| title16 = From Egypt\n| length16 = 2:23\n| title17 = Mr. Suso #2 with Reflection\n| length17 = 1:18\n| title18 = Powaqqatsi\n| length18 = 4:35\n| total_length = 73:38\n}}\n\n==Reception==\n[[Rotten Tomatoes]] reported that 63% out of 8 reviews were positive with the average score of 6.8 out of 10<ref name=\"rottent\">{{cite web |url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/powaqqatsi/ |title=Powaqqatsi (1988) - Rotten Tomatoes |access-date=2013-04-26 |work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]}}</ref> and said it \"wasn't as eagerly embraced by viewers and critics as its popular predecessor.\"\n\n''[[The New York Times]]'' said \"There are two kinds of dirt to be found in ''Powaqqatsi'': good dirt and bad. ...
