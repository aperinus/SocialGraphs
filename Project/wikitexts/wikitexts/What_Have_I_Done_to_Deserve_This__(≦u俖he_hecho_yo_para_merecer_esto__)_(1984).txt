({{lang-es|link=no|'''\u00bfQu\u00e9 he hecho yo para merecer esto!'''}}) is a 1984 Spanish [[black comedy]] film written and directed by [[Pedro Almod\u00f3var]]. The title is sometimes given with an exclamation mark at the end rather than a question mark. Starring [[Carmen Maura]], [[\u00c1ngel de Andr\u00e9s L\u00f3pez]], [[Chus Lampreave]] and [[Ver\u00f3nica Forqu\u00e9]], the film follows the misadventures of an overworked housewife and her dysfunctional family. Almod\u00f3var has described ''What Have I Done'' as a homage to [[Italian neorealism]], although this tribute also involves jokes about [[paedophilia]], prostitution, and a [[Telekinesis|telekinetic]] child.\n\n==Plot==\nGloria, a downtrodden housewife, lives with her husband Antonio, mother-in-law and two sons in a small, shabby and overcrowded apartment located by the [[Madrid]] motorway. Besides taking care of her home and family, Gloria also works as a cleaning lady to make ends meet and takes [[amphetamines]] to keep going. Her marriage to Antonio, a taxi driver, is on the rocks. Fifteen years earlier, in Germany, Antonio worked as a driver for Ingrid Muller, a German singer with whom he had a brief affair. His only mementos of their liaison are a signed photograph and a tape of her song ''Nur nicht Aus Liebe Weinen'' which he constantly plays and which Gloria detests. Antonio's services for Ingrid involved copying letters that she had allegedly received from [[Hitler]] himself. In his taxi, Antonio meets the writer Lucas and Antonio casually mentions this fact to Lucas, who suggests that they forge Hitler's diaries for a big profit.\n\nThere is also a book of Ingrid's memoirs written by a friend which contains letters from Hitler which Antonio helped forge. Antonio is trying to teach the art of forgery to one of his sons, as this talent will be his only inheritance. The younger son, Miguel, who is twelve, sleeps around with older men. When Gloria confronts Miguel, telling him she knows he has been sleeping with older men (including his friend's father), Miguel responds: \"I'm the master of my own body.\" Gloria's eldest son, Toni, who is fourteen, wants to become a farmer and is saving up enough money to buy a farm by peddling [[heroin]]. The grandmother, who is addicted to soft drinks, shares the same dream of returning to her native village. Gloria's friends are her two neighbors: Cristal and Juani. Cristal is a prostitute with a heart of gold. Juani, is a bitter woman obsessed with cleanliness and vulgar ornaments, her daughter, Vanessa, has  [[telekinetic]] powers, which she uses to destroy their apartment.\n\nGloria's life has become unbearable. She has no hope, no money, no opportunities yet she is still required to pay for the apartment, the television, the telephone, the lighting, the heating, the rates, and the weekly shopping. Increasingly desperate to find extra money to pay the bills, she is forced to work for a couple of bankrupt writers; she has to put up with a lizard that Toni and his grandmother have brought home. Unable to pay for Miguel's dental treatment, Gloria has little hesitation in allowing Miguel to live with the dentist, a [[pedophile]]. Miguel accepts once certain material conditions are met.\n\nRefused sedatives by a pharmacist without a prescription, the defeated Gloria returns home to find her husband preparing to take Ingrid Muller for a drive. An argument ensues, Antonio slaps Gloria, and she strikes him on the head with a leg of ham. Hitting his neck on the sink, he dies instantly. The police investigation does not discover Gloria's guilt. Toni and his grandmother leave Madrid for her village. Abandoned, Gloria contemplates committing suicide. She changes her mind when her son Miguel returns unexpectedly and says he wants to take care of her.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Carmen Maura]] as Gloria: housewife and cleaning woman \n* [[\u00c1ngel de Andr\u00e9s L\u00f3pez]] as Antonio: Gloria's husband, taxi driver and forger of letters\n* Juan Mart\u00ednez as Toni: their 14-year-old son and drug dealer\n* Miguel \u00c1ngel Herranz as Miguel: their 12-year-old son\n* [[Chus Lampreave]] as Grandmother: Antonio's mother who lives with them\n* [[Ver\u00f3nica Forqu\u00e9]] as Cristal: prostitute who lives in the same apartment block\n* [[Kiti Manver]] as Juani: [[dressmaker]] who lives in the same apartment block\n* Sonia Hohmann as Vanessa: Juani's daughter with telekinetic powers\n* [[Gonzalo Su\u00e1rez (director)|Gonzalo Su\u00e1rez]] as Lucas Villalba: writer who meets Antonio in a taxi\n* [[Amparo Soler Leal]] as Patricia: Villalba's wife\n* [[Katia Loritz]] as Ingrid M\u00fcller: German woman, Antonio's former girlfriend \n* Luis Hostalot as Polo: Policeman with [[erectile dysfunction]]\n* Javier Gurruchaga as Dentist who wants to adopt Miguel\n* [[Cecilia Roth]] as Woman in TV commercial\n* [[Pedro Almod\u00f3var]] as Playback 'La bien pag\u00e1'\n* [[Agust\u00edn Almod\u00f3var|Tin\u00edn Almod\u00f3var]] as Bank teller\n* Carlitos as Dinero (\"Money\"): lizard\n\n==Background==\n{{section unsourced|date=December 2021}}\n''What Have I Done'', Almodovar's fourth film, became the first of his works to be released theatrically in the U.S. premiering to sold-out crowds as part of New Directors/New Films series, co-sponsored by the [[New York Film Festival]] and the Film Department of the Museum of Modern Art. The film, set in the tower blocks around Madrid, depicts female frustration and family breakdown, echoing [[Jean-Luc Godard]]'s ''[[Two or Three Things I Know About Her]]'' and strong story plots from  [[Roald Dahl]]'s ''[[Lamb to the Slaughter]]'' and  [[Truman Capote]]'s [[Music for Chameleons|\"A Day's Work\"]] but with Almod\u00f3var's unique approach to filmmaking. Technically, ''What Have I Done?'' is deliberately crude and the production values raw, a combined result of the film's low-budget as well as Almodovar's relative lack of experience. But the film's shabby look is in tune with the tale's squalid realistic context and social class of its protagonists. ''What Have I Done?'' was  critically much better received than Almodovar's three previous films and put him on the movie map in America as a major talent to watch.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title}}\n* {{AllMovie title}}\n* {{Rotten Tomatoes}}\n\n{{Pedro Almod\u00f3var}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:What Have I Done To Deserve This?
