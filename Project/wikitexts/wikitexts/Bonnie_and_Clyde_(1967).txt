Bonnie, who is bored by her job as a waitress, is intrigued by Clyde and decides to take up with him and become his partner in crime. They pull off some holdups, but their amateur efforts, while exciting, are not very lucrative. Bonnie and Clyde turn from small-time heists to bank robbing.\n\nThe duo's crime spree shifts into high gear once they hook up with a dim-witted gas station attendant, C.W. Moss. Their exploits also become more violent. After C.W. botches parking during a bank robbery and delays their escape, Clyde shoots the bank manager in the face when he jumps onto the slow-moving car's running board. Clyde's older brother [[Buck Barrow|Buck]] and his wife, [[Blanche Barrow|Blanche]], a preacher's daughter, also join them. The two women dislike each other at first sight, and their antipathy escalates. Blanche has nothing but disdain for Bonnie, Clyde, and C.W., while Bonnie sees Blanche's flightiness as a constant danger to the gang's survival.\n\nIn Joplin, Missouri, local police drive to the hideout thinking the gang are bootleggers; two policeman are killed in a shootout. The gang is pursued by law enforcement, including Texas Ranger [[Frank Hamer]], whom they capture and humiliate before setting him free. A raid later catches the outlaws off guard in which more law officers are killed, Buck is mortally wounded by a shot to his head, and Blanche is injured in the eye. Bonnie, Clyde, and C.W. barely escape alive. With Blanche sightless and in police custody, Hamer tricks her into revealing C.W.'s name (until then he was only an \"unidentified suspect\").\n\nHamer finds Bonnie, Clyde, and C.W. hiding at the house of C.W.'s father Ivan, who thinks the couple have corrupted his son (as evidenced by an ornate tattoo Bonnie convinced C.W. to get). The elder Moss strikes a bargain with Hamer: in exchange for leniency for C.W., he sets a trap for the outlaws. When Bonnie and Clyde stop on the side of the road to help Mr. Moss fix a flat tire, the police in the bushes open fire and riddle them with bullets. Hamer and his posse come out of hiding and look pensively at the couple's bodies as a nearby flock of [[swallows]]<!--they look like doves or quail--> flies away.\n\n==Cast==\n<!--- Cast and order per opening tombstone credits, roles per closing credits scroll --->\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Warren Beatty]] as [[Clyde Barrow]]\n* [[Faye Dunaway]] as [[Bonnie Parker]]\n* [[Michael J.

Influenced by the French New Wave writers and not yet completed, Newman and Benton sent Penn an early draft. He already was engaged in production decisions for ''[[The Chase (1966 film)|The Chase]]'' (1966) and could not get involved in the script for ''Bonnie and Clyde''. The writers sent their script to [[Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut]], who made contributions but passed on the project, next directing ''[[Fahrenheit 451 (1966 film)|Fahrenheit 451]]''.<ref>{{Cite book |last1=Toubiana |first1=Serge |last2=de Baecque |first2=Antoine |title=Truffaut: A Biography |location=New York |publisher=Knopf |year=1999 |isbn=0-375-40089-3 |url=https://archive.org/details/truffaut00baec }}</ref> At Truffaut's suggestion, the writers, much excited (the film's producers were less so), approached filmmaker [[Jean-Luc Godard]]. Some sources claim Godard did not trust Hollywood and refused; Benton claimed that Godard wanted to shoot the film in New Jersey in January during the winter. He purportedly took offense when would-be producer Norah Wright objected that his desire was unreasonable, as the story took place in Texas, which has a warm climate year-round.<ref>{{cite book|last=Harris|first=Mark|title=Pictures at a Revolution: Five Films and the Birth of the New Hollywood|url=https://archive.org/details/picturesatrevolu00harr_0|url-access=registration|year=2008|publisher=The Penguin Press|pages=[https://archive.org/details/picturesatrevolu00harr_0/page/66 66\u201367]|isbn=9781594201523 }}</ref> Her partner Elinor Jones{{sfn|Harris|2008|p=66}} claimed the two did not believe Godard was right for the project in the first place.

On returning to Hollywood, Beatty requested to see the script and bought the rights. A meeting with Godard was not productive. Beatty changed his approach and convinced the writers that while the script at first reading was very much of the French New Wave style, an American director was necessary for the subject.<ref>\"Arthur Penn et la Nouvelle Vague\" (in French language), Luc Lagier. 27/November/2012 |publisher= Magazine Arte.tv | {{cite web|url=http://www.arte.tv/fr/rencontre/6371546.html |title=Arthur Penn et la Nouvelle Vague &#124; Blow up - L&#039;actualit\u00e9 du cin\u00e9ma (Ou presque) &#124; Cin\u00e9ma &#124; fr - ARTE |access-date=January 5, 2015 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150105103102/http://www.arte.tv/fr/rencontre/6371546.html |archive-date=January 5, 2015 }}</ref>\n\nBeatty offered the directing position to [[George Stevens]], [[William Wyler]], [[Karel Reisz]], [[John Schlesinger]], [[Brian G.

Penn turned it down several times before Beatty finally persuaded him to direct the film.<ref>''Arthur Penn: American Director'' by Nat Segaloff.

When Beatty decided to play Clyde, they needed a different actress. Considered for the role were [[Jane Fonda]], [[Tuesday Weld]], [[Ann-Margret]], [[Sharon Tate]], [[Leslie Caron]], [[Carol Lynley]] and [[Sue Lyon]].<ref>{{cite book |first=Eila |last=Mell |author-link=Eila Mell |date=2005 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1SqXAAAAQBAJ&pg=PA40 |title=Casting Might-Have-Beens |publisher=[[McFarland & Company, Inc.]] |page=40|isbn=9781476609768 }}</ref> [[Cher]] auditioned for the part, and Beatty begged [[Natalie Wood]] to play the role. Wood declined, to concentrate on her therapy, and acknowledged that working with Beatty before had been \"difficult\". [[Faye Dunaway]] later said that she won the part \"by the skin of her teeth!\"{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}\n\nThe film is forthright in its handling of sexuality, but that theme was toned down from its conception. Originally, Benton and Newman wrote Clyde as bisexual. He and Bonnie were to have a three-way sexual relationship with their male getaway driver. Penn persuaded the writers that since the couple's relationship was underwritten in terms of emotional complexity, it dissipated the passion of the title characters. This would threaten the audience's sympathy for the characters, and might result in their being written off as sexual deviants because they were criminals. Others said that Beatty was unwilling to have his character display that kind of sexuality and that the [[Production Code]] would never have allowed such content in the first place.{{sfn|Harris|2008|pp=205\u2013206}} Clyde is portrayed as heterosexual and [[Erectile dysfunction|impotent]].\n\n''Bonnie and Clyde'' was one of the first films to feature extensive use of [[bullet hit squib|squibs]]\u2014small explosive charges, often mounted with bags of [[stage blood]], that detonate inside an actor's clothes to simulate bullet hits. Released in an era when film shootings were generally depicted as bloodless and painless, the Bonnie and Clyde death scene was one of the first in mainstream American cinema to be depicted with graphic realism.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.topic.com/the-twisting-history-of-blood-on-film|title=The Twisting History of Blood on Film|work=Topic|access-date=2018-01-24|language=en|archive-date=March 23, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180323055900/https://www.topic.com/the-twisting-history-of-blood-on-film|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nBeatty originally wanted the film to be shot in black and white, but Warner Bros. rejected the idea. Much of the studio's senior management was hostile to the film, especially [[Jack L. Warner]], who considered the subject matter an unwanted throwback to Warner Bros.' early period, when gangster films were common product.{{sfn|Harris|2008|p=325}} Moreover, Warner was already annoyed at Beatty for refusing to star in ''[[PT 109 (film)|PT 109]]'' and defying Warner's favorite gesture of authority of showing the studio water tower with the ''WB'' logo on it. Beatty said, \"Well, it's got your name, but it's got my initials.\"{{sfn|Harris|2008|p=192}} Warner complained about the costs of the film's extensive location shooting in Texas, which exceeded its production schedule and budget, and ordered the crew back to the studio backlot. It already had planned to return for final process shots.{{sfn|Harris|2008|pp=258\u2013259}}\n\n===Music===\n\"[[Foggy Mountain Breakdown]]\" by [[Flatt and Scruggs]], the instrumental banjo piece, was introduced to a worldwide audience as a result of its frequent use in the movie. Its use is anachronistic because [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]] dates from the mid-1940s rather than the 1930s.
