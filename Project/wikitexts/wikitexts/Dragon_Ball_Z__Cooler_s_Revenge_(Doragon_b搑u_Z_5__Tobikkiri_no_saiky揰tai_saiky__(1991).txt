His [[henchmen]] prepare to destroy a space pod fleeing the doomed planet that is transporting a Saiyan infant to Earth; but Cooler allows it to go, accounting that it is Frieza's responsibility. More than twenty years later, this Saiyan, [[Goku]], defeats Frieza. After learning of his brother's death, Cooler takes his men \u2013 Salza, Neiz, and Dore, on a mission to reclaim his family's honor. On Earth, Cooler's forces ambush Goku and his friends while they are on a [[camping]] trip. Goku is badly wounded when he protects [[Gohan]] from an [[Qi|energy blast]] launched by Cooler.\n\n[[Krillin]] and [[Oolong (Dragon Ball)|Oolong]] find shelter in a cave with Goku, while Gohan travels to obtain the magic Senzu beans that can heal his father. Cooler orders his men to completely obliterate the forest, believing Goku is in hiding. After obtaining the beans, Gohan is ambushed by Cooler's men before [[Piccolo (Dragon Ball)|Piccolo]] arrives to save him. Piccolo kills 'Dore and Neiz, but Cooler arrives and impales him with an energy beam. Salza manages to track Gohan to the cave and destroys the beans. However, Gohan successfully heals Goku with a spare one. Krillin and Gohan are quickly defeated by Salza but Goku soon emerges. Cooler taunts Goku by further injuring Piccolo. Goku incapacitates Salza and attacks Cooler.\n\nAfter Goku proves to be a worthy opponent, Cooler reveals that he discovered a new transformation above Frieza's capabilities. Goku is pummeled by Cooler, who boasts and mocks him. However, after seeing a bird die from wounds inflicted by their fight, Goku reflects on the well-being of his loved ones. Goku retrieves the deceased bird and transforms into his Super Saiyan form, using his energy to revive it.\n\nCooler finds himself grossly outclassed by Super Saiyan Goku. Cooler powers up an enormous energy sphere and launches the attack with the hopes to destroy Goku and the Earth along with him. Goku manages to resist and overpower the attack; he sends it hurdling toward Cooler who is launched into space and collides with the [[sun]]. As he is incinerated, Cooler realizes that Goku was the Saiyan infant he spared decades ago. As he laments over his mistake, he is disintegrated.\n\nGoku, drained after his victory, is found by his loved ones. They celebrate and search for Piccolo when Salza reappears and prepares to kill them. However, Salza is unexpectedly killed by Piccolo. Gohan yells out for Piccolo who is nowhere to be seen. Piccolo, having recovered, drinks some water and gazes skyward.\n\n==Cast==\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Character\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Japanese\n! colspan=\"3\" |English\n|-\n! <small>Audio Captain Productions/Creative Products Corp.
