They were so exhausted feeling guilty about slavery that I don't think there was much left over to be nice about our film.\" He also speculated that the death of Mandela resulted in a Mandela \"overdose\" among people, so that they have had enough of him when the movie finally hit the theatres; \"Suddenly the word came through that he died.

While calling him a \"terrific actor\", ''[[The Guardian]]'' criticised the film for the casting of Elba, of West African descent from [[Ghana]] and [[Sierra Leone]], as the [[Xhosa people|Xhosa]] Mandela, because Elba \"looks nothing like the man he portrays\".<ref>{{Cite web |date=2014-01-03 |title=A thoughtful Mandela biopic that doesn't dodge the difficult questions |url=http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/jan/03/nelson-mandela-long-walk-freedom-idris-elba-reel-history |access-date=2022-06-13 |website=the Guardian |language=en}}</ref>\n\nTurning to the 1976 [[Soweto uprising]], Hiribarren said that the film \"did not spend much time evoking this pivotal event, because Mandela did not say much about Soweto in his book. The Soweto uprising was, however, instrumental in creating a new political climate in South Africa that directly led to the politicisation of many young South Africans.\"<ref name=Hiribarren/>\n\nHiribarren awarded the film three stars for historical accuracy, and five for enjoyment.<ref name=Hiribarren/>\n\n==Awards==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:85%;\"\n|- style=\"background:#ccc; text-align:center;\"\n! colspan=\"4\" style=\"background: LightSteelBlue;\" | Awards\n|- style=\"background:#ccc; text-align:center;\"\n!
