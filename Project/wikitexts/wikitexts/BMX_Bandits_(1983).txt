J. and Goose, meet Judy, who is working as a trolley collector at the [[Westfield Warringah Mall|Warringah Mall]] during the school holidays in order to be able to buy her own BMX bike, and accidentally get Judy fired from her job when they crash into trolleys pushed away by the local \"Creep\". The three go out in Goose's dad's runabout on the harbour searching for cockles to sell in order to fix their own crashed bikes, as well as getting Judy her own, and stumble onto and steal a box of police-band [[walkie talkie]]s that the [[bank robber]]s were hoping to use to monitor on police traffic. After stealing the box, the kids pass Whitey and Moustache who are on their way in their high-powered motorboat to pick it up.\n\nJudy, P.J. and Goose sell the walkie-talkies to other kids in the area. The [[New South Wales Police Force|Bayside Police]] are able to hear the kids using the walkie talkies. Judy, P.J. and Goose are also unaware that the robbers know who stole the box. After they are spotted and chased late at night through a cemetery by Whitey and Moustache wearing monster masks (going formal, according to Whitey), they manage to escape. The next day, P.J. and Goose pick up their newly repaired bikes while Judy buys her bike. Judy is caught the next day by Whitey and Moustache while getting a second walkie talkie for The Creep, but escapes with the help of P.J. and Goose. The goons chase the Bandits in a cartoonish chase across various sites around [[Sydney]], including a memorable escape down the [[Manly Waterworks]] [[water slide]]s, complete with [[BMX]] bikes.\n\nThe trio are finally arrested but escape police custody and, with the help of the local kids, launch their own plan to foil the planned payroll robbery. Using the walkie-talkies, the Bandits pinpoint the meeting place for the robbers, then proceed to ambush and apprehend the robbers. The Boss, Whitey and Moustache escape in a removal truck with Judy as a hostage, with P.J. and Goose taking chase. They cause the truck to crash, with police soon arriving to arrest The Boss, Whitey and Moustache.\n\nThe police build a BMX track as thanks for the capture. In its opening meeting, the BMX Bandits sweep the main awards.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{div col}}\n*[[Nicole Kidman]] as Judy\n*Angelo D'Angelo as P.J.\n*James Lugton as Goose\n*[[David Argue]] as Whitey\n*John Ley as Moustache\n*[[Bryan Marshall]] as The Boss\n*Brian Sloman as The Creep\n*Peter Browne as Police Constable\n*Bill Brady as Police Sergeant\n*Linda Newton as Policewoman\t\n*Bob Hicks as Heavy #1\n*Guy Norris as Heavy #2\n*Chris Hession as Heavy #3\n*Norman Hodges as The Drunk\n*Brian Best as Supermarket Manager\n*Ray Marshall as Foreman\n*Patrick Mansfield as Crane Operator\n*De Vuong as BMX Stunt Rider\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Filming locations==\n* [[Northern Beaches]]\n* [[Westfield Warringah Mall|Warringah Mall]]\n* Waverley Cemetery, Bronte\n* [[Manly Oval]]\n* [[Manly Waterworks]]\n* The Corso\n* [[Manly Beach]]\n* [[Port Jackson|Sydney Harbour]]\n* [[Lane Cove]] Flour bombing scene\n* [[Hickeys lane bmx track, penrith]] in the end credits]]\n\n==Production==\nThe film was originally going to be written and directed by [[Russell Hagg]], only it was going to be about nine-year old characters. He was unable to raise finance. The project passed to producer [[Tom Broadbridge]] who hired Hagg's frequent collaborator [[Patrick Edgeworth]] to rewrite the script and make it about teenagers.<ref name=\"buff\">{{cite podcast|url=http://filmbuffs.libsyn.com/10-universals-australian-chief-and-an-englishman-abroad|date=27 October 2017|title=10 - Universal's Australian Chief and An Englishman Abroad|host=Film Buff's Forecast}}</ref>\n\n[[Brian Trenchard-Smith]] was hired after the producers had been impressed by his handling of action in ''[[Turkey Shoot (1982 film)|Turkey Shoot]]''. He says the script was originally set in Melbourne but he persuaded them to re-set it in Sydney to take advantage of that city's locations. He set it on the northern beaches and wrote action sequences based on \"my concept for the BMX action being putting BMX bikes where BMX bikes aren\u2019t meant to be.\"<ref name=\"gordon\">[http://gordonandthewhale.com/interview-genre-film-virtuoso-brian-trenchard-smith-discusses-upcoming-bmx-bandits-blu-ray/ Brian Kelly, \"Interview: Genre film virtuoso Brian Trenchard-Smith discusses upcoming BMX BANDITS Blu-ray\", ''Gordon and the Whale'' 11 March 2011] accessed 8 February 2013</ref> The movie was shot over 41 days, a longer than normal shoot because of the labour restrictions caused by the fact many of the cast were under 16. Trenchard-Smith:\n\n<blockquote>I wanted to capture the spirit of the [[Ealing comedies]] and British films of the '50s and '60s that were clearly aimed at children and delivered action and fun in a largely cartoonish way. If you look at the basic premise of the plot, the crooks clearly want to or intend to kill the children at some point, so how do you disguise that and make that palatable to an audience of kids and parents? You make the crooks buffoonish, the gang that couldn\u2019t shoot straight, so that takes the curse off the underlying purpose.<ref name=\"gordon\"/></blockquote>\n\n[[Nicole Kidman]] sprained her ankle during filming. No female stunt double that looked like her could be found so her bike stunts were performed by an 18-year-old man in a wig.<ref>[http://insidemovies.ew.com/2011/03/06/16-year-old-nicole-kidman-with-exclusive-video/ Chris Nashawaty \"Check out a 16-year-old Nicole Kidman!
