It follows Tomas Ericsson (Bj\u00f6rnstrand), pastor of a small rural Swedish church, as he deals with an [[existential crisis]] and his Christianity.\n\nThe film is the second in a series of thematically related films, following ''[[Through a Glass Darkly (film)|Through a Glass Darkly]]'' (1961) and followed by ''[[The Silence (1963 film)|The Silence]]'' (1963); this is sometimes considered a trilogy. In it, Bergman reconsiders ''Through a Glass Darkly''{{'}}s argument that God is love, and repeated the prior film's reference to God as a monstrous spider.\n\nBergman formed the story after speaking to a clergyman whose parishioner committed suicide. It was shot in different locations in Sweden in 1962. [[Vilgot Sj\u00f6man]]'s film ''[[Ingmar Bergman Makes a Movie]]'' was made simultaneously with ''Winter Light'' and documents its production. The feature received positive reviews for its cinematography and themes.\n\n==Plot==\nIn the final moments of Pastor Tomas Ericsson's noon [[church service|service]], only a handful of people are in attendance, including fisherman Jonas Persson and his pregnant wife Karin, and Tomas's ex-mistress, the [[atheism|atheistic]] M\u00e4rta. After the service, Tomas, though coming down with a cold, prepares for his three o'clock service in another town. Before he leaves, however, the Perssons arrive to speak to him. Jonas has become morose after hearing that China is developing an [[Nuclear weapon|atomic bomb]]. Tomas speaks to the man briefly, but asks Jonas to return after taking his wife home. No sooner have the Perssons left than substitute teacher M\u00e4rta enters, and she attempts to comfort the miserable Tomas, and asks if he's read the letter she wrote to him. He has not, and tells her of his failure to help Jonas, and wonders if he will have anything to say, since he is without hope as well. M\u00e4rta states her love for Tomas, but also her belief that he does not love her. She leaves, and Tomas reads her letter.\n\nIn the letter, M\u00e4rta describes Tomas's neglect of her, relating a story of how a [[rash]] that disfigured her body repulsed him, and neither his faith nor his prayers did anything to help her. She writes of how her family was warm and loving without religion, and expresses bewilderment at his indifference to Jesus. Tomas finishes the letter, and falls asleep. Awakened by the return of Jonas, Tomas clumsily tries to provide counsel, before finally admitting that he has no faith as well. He says his faith was an egotistical one \u2013 God loved humanity, but Tomas most of all. Serving in [[Lisbon]] during the [[Spanish Civil War]], Tomas could not reconcile his loving God with the atrocities being committed, so he ignored them. Tomas finally tells Jonas that things make more sense if we deny the existence of God, because then man's cruelty needs no explanation. Jonas leaves, and Tomas faces the [[crucifix]] and declares himself finally free.\n\nM\u00e4rta, who has been lurking in the chapel, is overjoyed to hear this, and embraces Tomas, who again does not respond to her affections. They are interrupted by the widow Magdalena, who tells them that Jonas has just committed suicide with a rifle. Tomas drives, alone, to the scene, and stoically helps the police cover Jonas's body with a [[Tarpaulin|tarp]]. M\u00e4rta arrives on foot, and she and Tomas drive off to her home, where she invites him in to take some medicine for his [[common cold|cold]]. Waiting in M\u00e4rta's classroom attached to her house, Tomas finally lashes out at her, telling her first that he rejected her because he was tired of the gossip about them. When that fails to deter her affections, Tomas then tells her that he was tired of her problems, her attempts to care for him, and her constant talking, and that M\u00e4rta could never measure up to his late wife, the only woman he has ever loved. Though shocked by the attack, M\u00e4rta agrees to drive with him to the Persson house. Informed of Jonas's suicide, Karin collapses onto the stairs and wonders how she and her children will go on. Tomas makes a perfunctory offer of help, and leaves.\n\nArriving for the three o'clock service at the second church, Tomas and M\u00e4rta find the building empty except for Algot, the handicapped sexton, and Fredrik, the organist. In the vestry, Algot questions Tomas about the [[Passion (Christianity)|Passion]]. Algot wonders why so much emphasis was placed on the physical suffering of Jesus, which was brief in comparison to the many betrayals he faced from his [[Disciple (Christianity)|disciple]]s, who denied his messages and commands, and finally from God, who did not answer him on the cross. He asks, \"Wasn't God's silence worse?\" Tomas, who has been listening silently, answers yes. Meanwhile, Fredrik tells M\u00e4rta that she should leave the small town and Tomas and live her life, rather than stay and have her dreams crushed like the rest of them, but she chooses to start praying. Fredrik and Algot wonder if they should have a service since no one has shown up. Tomas still chooses to hold it, and the bells are rung. He begins the service reciting the ''Sanctus'': \"Holy Holy Holy, Lord God Almighty; heaven and earth are full of your glory.\"\n\n==Cast==\n{{multiple image\n | align     = right\n | direction = horizontal\n | footer    = [[Gunnar Bj\u00f6rnstrand]], [[Ingrid Thulin]] and [[Gunnel Lindblom]] have starring roles.\n | footer_align = left\n | width     =\n | image1    = Gunnar Bj\u00f6rnstrand, Swedish actor (B&W).jpg\n | width1    = 155\n | alt1      = \n | image2    = Ingrid-thulin-gullers.jpg\n | width2    = 215\n | alt2      = \n | image3    = Gunnel lindblom.jpg\n | width3    = 100\n | alt3      = \n}}\n* [[Gunnar Bj\u00f6rnstrand]] \u2013 Tomas Ericsson, pastor\n* [[Ingrid Thulin]] \u2013 M\u00e4rta Lundberg, schoolteacher\n* [[Gunnel Lindblom]] \u2013 Karin Persson\n* [[Max von Sydow]] \u2013 Jonas Persson\n* [[Allan Edwall]] \u2013 Algot Fr\u00f6vik, sexton\n* [[Kolbj\u00f6rn Knudsen]] \u2013 Knut Aronsson, warden\n* [[Olof Thunberg]] \u2013 Fredrik Blom, organist\n* [[Elsa Ebbesen]] \u2013 Magdalena Ledfors, widow\n\n==Themes==\n[[Ingmar Bergman]] identified previous films he had made with similar themes as ''[[The Virgin Spring]]'' (1960) and ''[[Through a Glass Darkly (film)|Through a Glass Darkly]]'' (1961).<ref name=\"SjomanBergman\">{{cite episode |title=The Script |series=[[Ingmar Bergman Makes a Movie]] |first1=Vilgot |last1=Sj\u00f6man |first2=Ingmar |last2=Bergman  |network=[[Sveriges Television]] |date=1963}}</ref> ''Winter Light'' is often considered the second film in a trilogy, following ''Through a Glass Darkly'' and completed by ''[[The Silence (1963 film)|The Silence]]''.<ref name=\"Ebert\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/great-movie-winter-light-1962 |title=Winter Light |last=Ebert |first=Roger |date=1 December 2007 |access-date=2 November 2016 |work=Rogerebert.com}}</ref>{{sfn|Maltin|2014}}<ref name=\"Harper\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.sensesofcinema.com/2005/cteq/winter_light/ |title=Winter Light |last=Harper |first=Dan |date=February 2005 |access-date=2 November 2016 |work=[[Senses of Cinema]]}}</ref> All three films focus on spiritual issues.
