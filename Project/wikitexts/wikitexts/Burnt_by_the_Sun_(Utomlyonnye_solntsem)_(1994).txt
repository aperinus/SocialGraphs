The film depicts the story of a senior [[Red Army]] officer, played by Mikhalkov, and his family during the [[Great Purge]] of the late 1930s in the [[Stalinism|Stalinist]] [[Soviet Union]]. While on vacation with his wife, young daughter, and assorted friends and family, things change dramatically for Colonel Kotov when his wife's old lover, Dmitri, shows up after being away for many years. The film also stars [[Oleg Menshikov]], [[Ingeborga Dapk\u016bnait\u0117]] and Mikhalkov's daughter [[Nadezhda Mikhalkova]].\n\n''Burnt by the Sun'' was popular in Russia and received positive reviews in the United States. It won the [[Grand Prix (Cannes Film Festival)|Grand Prix]] at the [[1994 Cannes Film Festival]], the [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film]] and other honours.\n\n==Plot==\nThe entirety of the film takes place within the course of one day in the summer of 1936 in the [[Soviet Union]]. After witnessing Mitya contemplate suicide, the film cuts to [[Comdiv]] Sergei Petrovich Kotov, his wife Maroussia, and their young six-year-old daughter Nadia relaxing in a [[Banya (sauna)|banya]] when a peasant from the local [[Collective farming|collective farm]] frantically tells them the [[Red Army]]'s tanks are about to crush the [[wheat]] harvest as part of general [[Military exercise|maneuvers]]. After hearing this news, Kotov rides out to order the tank officer to halt. Kotov carries authority as a senior [[Old Bolshevik]] and legendary hero of the 1917 [[Russian Civil War]], and he is also very popular with the common people and local villagers. The opening scene makes it clear that Kotov is a devoted family man, and he claims to be a personal friend of Stalin.\n\nFollowing this incident, the happy family returns to their country [[dacha]] (country estate), where they join Maroussia's relatives, a large and eccentric family of [[Anton Chekhov|Chekhovian]] aristocrats. However, Mitya (Dmitri), an ex-[[Russian nobility|nobleman]] and veteran of the [[Anti-communism|anti-communist]] White Army soon arrives after being away for roughly ten years. He was Maroussia's fianc\u00e9 before disappearing in 1927. He shows up in a costume to disguise himself, but when he takes it off he is joyfully embraced by the family and introduced to Nadia as \"Uncle Mitya\". Maroussia is left feeling deeply conflicted, as she had suffered deeply when he left without explanation and even contemplated suicide as seen through the self-inflicted marks on her wrists.{{citation needed|date=June 2022}}\n\nDespite his personable nature, it is clear that Mitya has returned with a secret agenda. It is slowly revealed throughout the duration of the afternoon that he works for the Soviet political police, the [[NKVD]], and has arrived to arrest Kotov for a non-existent conspiracy that Mitya had framed him for. Mitya is abusing his power for the purpose of revenge, since ten years ago Kotov had conscripted Mitya into the [[State Political Directorate|OGPU]], the predecessor of the NKVD, and was therefore the reason for Mitya being taken away. Mitya detests Kotov, whom he blames for causing him to lose Maroussia, his love for Russia, faith, and his profession as a [[pianist]]. Kotov confronts Mitya about his activities in [[Paris]], where he gave up eight White Army generals to the NKVD. All were kidnapped, smuggled to the Soviet Union, and shot dead without trial.\n\nAlthough eventually realizing that Mitya intends to take him away, Kotov believes that his close relationship with Soviet dictator [[Joseph Stalin]] will save him. However, a black car carrying NKVD agents arrives to remove Kotov, just as a group of [[Vladimir Lenin All-Union Pioneer Organization|Young Pioneer]] children arrives at the dacha to pay tribute to him. Kotov willingly goes with Mitya, pretending to be Mitya's friend and even lets Nadia briefly ride in the car with them. While riding away in the car with his captors, Kotov reminds them who he is and his status, but he quickly realizes that they don't care and that it was Stalin himself who ordered his arrest. Only after looking into Mitya's eyes does Kotov realize the severity of the situation, causing him to breakdown in tears. Kotov is forced to make a false confession to all the charges Mitya framed him for and is shot dead in August 1936. Meanwhile, following Mitya's success in his revenge against Kotov, he ultimately commits suicide, as his revenge did not satisfy him in the way he thought it would. In addition, Maroussia is arrested and dies in the [[Gulag]] in 1940. Although arrested with her mother and taken to a concentration camp, Nadia lives to see all three sentences overturned during the [[Khrushchev thaw]], in 1956, and works as a teacher in [[Kazakhstan]].\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Oleg Menshikov]] \u2013 Dimitri Arsentyev (Mitya), NKVD man\n* [[Nikita Mikhalkov]] \u2013 Comdiv Sergei Petrovich Kotov\n* [[Ingeborga Dapk\u016bnait\u0117]] \u2013 Maroussia, Kotov's wife\n* [[Nadezhda Mikhalkova]] \u2013 Nadia, Kotov's daughter\n* [[Andr\u00e9 Oumansky]] \u2013 Philippe, Mitya's valet\n* [[Vyacheslav Tikhonov]] \u2013 Vsevolod, Maroussia's uncle\n* [[Svetlana Nikolaevna Kryuchkova|Svetlana Kryuchkova]] \u2013 Mokhova, Kotov's housekeeper\n* [[Vladimir Ilyin (actor)|Vladimir Ilyin]] \u2013 Kirik, Yelena Mikhailovna's son\n* [[Alla Kazanskaya]] \u2013 Lidiya Stepanovna, Maroussia's grandmother\n* [[Nina Arkhipova]] \u2013 Yelena Mikhailovna, Lidiya Stepanovna's friend\n* [[Avangard Leontiev]] \u2013 Chauffeur\n* [[Inna Ulyanova]] \u2013 Olga Nikolayevna, Maroussia's mother\n* [[Lyubov Rudneva]] \u2013 Lyuba, Vsevolod's student\n* [[Vladimir Ryabov]] \u2013 NKVD officer\n* [[Vladimir Belousov (actor)|Vladimir Belousov]] \u2013 NKVD man\n* [[Aleksey Pokatilov]] \u2013 NKVD man\n* [[Evgeniy Mironov]] \u2013 Lieutenant\n\n}}\n\n==Production==\n===Background===\nThe [[Russian Civil War]] of 1917 was a multi-party civil war in the Russian Empire that followed the two Russian revolutions of 1917. It lasted until 1922 and transformed the lives of many Russians. The Red Army was led by Vladimir Lenin, but after he died in 1924, Stalin was able to establish his position as the ruler of the Soviet regime. Throughout the 1930s, Stalin launched a campaign of political terror that is now known as the [[Great Purge]]. During this time people were regularly rounded up and killed as traitors without a trial.<ref>{{cite web |title=Historical Background |url=https://www.sonyclassics.com/burntbysun/misc/history.html |website=Sony Pictures Classics |access-date=18 May 2021}}</ref> The purges, arrests, and deportations to labor camps affected many people.

The song is heard [[Leitmotif|repeatedly]] in the film; the director Mikhalkov said in 2007 that he learned of the song from his elder brother [[Andrei Konchalovsky]]'s [[1979 in film|1979]] film ''[[Siberiade]].''
