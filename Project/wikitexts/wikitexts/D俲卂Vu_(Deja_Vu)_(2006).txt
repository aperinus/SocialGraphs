The film stars [[Denzel Washington]], [[Paula Patton]], [[Jim Caviezel]], [[Val Kilmer]], [[Adam Goldberg (actor)|Adam Goldberg]] and [[Bruce Greenwood]]. It involves an [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives|ATF]] agent who travels back in time in an attempt to prevent a domestic terrorist attack that takes place in [[New Orleans]] and to save a woman with whom he falls in love.\n\nFilming took place in New Orleans after [[Effects of Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans|Hurricane Katrina]].<ref name=\"News...\" /> The film premiered in [[New York City]] on November 20, 2006, and was released in the United States and Canada on November 22, 2006. It received mixed reviews from critics and earned $180 million worldwide against its $75 million production budget. It was the 23rd most successful film worldwide for 2006. The film was nominated for six awards, winning the [[Motion Picture Sound Editors|International Gold Reel Award]].\n\n==Plot==\n{{Long plot|date=October 2022}}\nOn [[Mardi Gras]] in [[New Orleans]], the ferry ''Senator Alvin T. Stumpf'' is carrying hundreds of [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] sailors and their families across the [[Mississippi River]] from their base to the city. Suddenly, the ferry explodes and sinks, killing 543 passengers and crew members.\n\nSpecial Agent Douglas Carlin from the [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives]] (ATF) is sent to investigate and discovers evidence of a bomb planted by a domestic terrorist. Arriving at the scene, he meets with local investigators and [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] Special Agent Paul Pryzwarra, and informs them of his findings. He learns about and is invited to examine a partially burned body pulled from the river, identified as Claire Kuchever, which was reported to the authorities minutes before the explosion.\n\nPryzwarra, impressed with Doug's detective expertise, asks him to join a newly formed governmental detective unit and investigate the bombing. Led by Dr. Alexander Denny, they investigate the events before the explosion by using a program called \"Snow White,\" which enables them to look into the past (4 days, 6 hours, 3 minutes, 45 seconds, 14.5 nanoseconds) in detail by (according to Pryzwarra) using several satellites to form a triangulated image of events. The system is limited in that they can only see past events once; there is no fast forwarding or rewinding, although they can record what they see in the process. Convinced that Claire is a vital link, Doug persuades them to focus on her. While the team observes Claire's past through Snow White, the bomber calls her to talk about the SUV she advertised for sale. He does not buy her car, but the Snow White team is able to trace the call and use video surveillance recordings to determine where he will be in 7 hours.\n\nDoug finds out that Snow White is actually a time window, and can send inanimate objects into the past. Despite Denny's protests against tampering with the past, Doug has the team send a note back to his past self with the time and place the bomber will be. Instead, his partner Larry Minuti gets the note and is shot by the bomber while following up on it. The team attempts to follow the fleeing bomber, who takes Minuti with him, but he moves outside of Snow White's range. However, Doug is able to follow him in the present using a specially equipped vehicle with a mobile Snow White unit. In the past, the bomber takes Minuti to his bayou shack where he kills him and sets fire to his body. Still needing a vehicle big enough to hold the bomb, the bomber goes to Claire's address, kidnaps her and takes her car.\n\nUsing a [[facial recognition system]], the ferry bomber is identified and taken into custody. He is revealed to be Carroll Oerstadt, a mentally unstable \"patriot\" who began to resent the [[US Army]] and the [[US Marine Corps]] after they repeatedly refused his enlistment attempts because of his failed [[Military Entrance Processing Station|medical and psychological tests]]. Considering the case closed, the government shuts down the Snow White investigation. Despite the bomber's capture, Claire and the ferry victims remain dead, which unsettles Doug since he is convinced that the Snow White team can actually [[Alternate history|alter history]]. Doug persuades Denny to do one last experiment: send Doug to the past to save Claire and stop the bombing (a risky procedure, since no living being has ever been sent back successfully). Doug survives the trip by being sent back to a hospital emergency room, where doctors are able to revive him. He steals a gun and an ambulance and races to Oerstadt's shack just in time to stop Claire's murder, while Oerstadt flees with the bomb. As Doug returns to Claire's home with her to treat a gunshot wound that he had received, Doug realizes this is not the first time that he has traveled in time to stop Oerstadt, leaving many of the clues for himself that he would find in the future and suggesting that a previous version of Doug had failed.\n\nDoug and Claire go to the ferry. Doug boards to try to find and disarm the bomb, but Oerstadt captures Claire and restrains her inside the vehicle in which he has placed the bomb. A brutal gunfight ensues, hampered by Oerstadt's body armor, before Doug distracts him using information he learned from his interrogation of the man in the future. While Oerstadt is distracted, Claire rams him with the truck, allowing Doug to finally kill him with a headshot. Doug attempts to free Claire but police surround them and threaten to open fire. Out of time, Doug purposely drives the vehicle off the end of the ferry before it explodes, saving the passengers. Claire swims free of the sinking car and is picked up by a rescue boat, but Doug is unable to escape and dies in the subsequent underwater explosion. As Claire mourns Doug's death, she is approached and consoled by an identical Doug Carlin from her present timeline.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Denzel Washington]] as ATF Special Agent Douglas Carlin\n* [[Paula Patton]] as Claire Kuchever\n* [[Jim Caviezel]] as Carroll Oerstadt         \n* [[Val Kilmer]] as FBI Special Agent Paul Pryzwarra\n* [[Adam Goldberg (actor)|Adam Goldberg]] as Dr. Alexander Denny        \n* [[Elden Henson]] as Gunnars\n* [[Erika Alexander]] as Shanti\n* [[Bruce Greenwood]] as FBI Special Agent-in-Charge Jack McCready\n* [[Matt Craven]] as ATF Special Agent Larry Minuti    \n* [[Elle Fanning]] as Abbey\n* [[Enrique Castillo]] as Claire's father\n\n==Background and production==\n===Script===\nThe idea of a [[time travel]] [[thriller film]] originated between screenwriters [[Bill Marsilii]] and [[Terry Rossio]], who were friends. Rossio had a one-page idea for a film called ''Prior Conviction'' about a cop who uses a Time Window to look seven days into the past to investigate his girlfriend's murder. As they were talking about it, Marsilii says \"I had this explosive kind of epiphany\u2014\"NO! He should fall in love with her *while* he's watching the last few days of her life.
