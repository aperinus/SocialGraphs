[[Metropolitan Police Department of the District of Columbia|Metropolitan Police]] homicide [[detective]] Harlan Regis, whose apartment block is awaiting demolition in favor of a parking lot, is put on the case. At the White House, Regis is introduced to [[United States Secret Service|U.S. Secret Service]] [[Director of the United States Secret Service|Director]] Nick Spikings, [[National Security Advisor (United States)|National Security Advisor]] Alvin Jordan, and Secret Service agent Nina Chance. Spikings assigns Chance, a former [[1988 Summer Olympics|Olympic gold-medal]] sharpshooter, to keep an eye on Regis.\n\nParallel to this, the White House has to deal with an impending international crisis: [[President of the United States|President]] Jack Neil has been trying to deal with a situation where Americans are being held hostage in [[North Korea]], and some people\u2014including several members of his inner circle, led by [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] Gordon Dylan\u2014think that Neil is not handling it the right way. Some people think that Neil should send troops to North Korea to rescue the hostages, but he does not want to risk a potential second [[Korean War]].\n\nWhite House janitor Cory Allen Luchessi was apparently unaccounted for on the night of the murder and had once made a pass at Carla. He is arrested and questioned, but his testimony and a clearly set-up piece of evidence lead Regis to suspect that the Secret Service may be involved. That night, Regis finds his apartment [[burglary|burglarized]]; the culprit escapes, and in a subsequent search, a hidden bug is found.\n\nIn a picture of Carla, Regis sees Burton Cash, the Secret Service agent assigned to Kyle Neil, the president's son. Regis figures out that Kyle had sex with Carla on the night of the murder. At a dance club, Regis talks with a young woman who says that Kyle once bragged that he shared Carla with his father. Carla's uncle's company, Brookline Associates, is the president's leading [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] fundraiser, and also owns the apartment that Carla lived in.\n\nRegis eventually discovers that Chance once was Kyle's bodyguard herself. When he confronts her, Chance explains that one night she discovered Kyle beating up his girlfriend. The Secret Service covered up the beating so that Kyle would not be arrested for assault, and Chance asked to be reassigned and was replaced by Cash. Upon being confronted by Regis, Kyle denies that he murdered Carla, but provides a special piece of information: among the bookings she made, Carla supposedly also ordered a car - despite not having a driver's license. Later on, Regis and Chance discover that the most recent entries in Carla's appointment book were forged.\n\nWith some clues left by Jordan, Regis finds out that Spikings has withheld several surveillance tapes from the night of the murder. Regis goes to Spikings' residence to question him; Spikings is willing to show the tape but is suddenly killed by a [[sniper]]. However, Regis and Chance escape the gunfire with the tape. They learn that Jordan engineered the murder in order to [[blackmail]] Neil into resigning, which would allow Dylan to assume office and have troops sent to North Korea.\n\nRegis, Chance, and Regis's partner Stengel enter the White House tunnels. The sniper pursues them and wounds Stengel, but Chance manages to kill him. Pursued by the Secret Service, Regis just barely manages to get in contact with Neil and present him with the evidence of Jordan's conspiracy. Jordan attempts to shoot Neil, after being punched in the face, only for his shot to be intercepted by a handcuffed Chance, and he is killed by the Secret Service. Chance and Stengel are brought to a hospital, where they recover from their injuries. In gratitude for his rescue, Neil asks Regis if there is anything he can do, whereupon Regis brings up his impending eviction.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Castlist|\n* [[Wesley Snipes]] as Detective Harlan Regis\n* [[Diane Lane]] as Secret Service Agent Nina Chance\n* [[Daniel Benzali]] as Secret Service Agent Nick Spikings\n* [[Dennis Miller]] as Detective Stengel\n* [[Alan Alda]] as National Security Adviser Alvin Jordan\n* [[Ronny Cox]] as President Jack Neil\n* [[Diane Baker]] as First Lady Kitty Neil\n* [[Tate Donovan]] as First Son Kyle Neil\n* [[Harris Yulin]] as General Clark Tully\n* [[Tom Wright (actor)|Tom Wright]] as Secret Service Agent Cooper\n* [[Nicholas Pryor]] as Paul Moran\n* [[Charles Rocket]] as Jeffrey \n* [[Nigel Bennett]] as Secret Service Agent Burton Cash\n* [[Tony Nappo]] as Luchessi \n* [[Tamara Gorski]] as Young Woman In Bar\n* Mary Moore as Carla Town\n* David Gardner as Speaker Of The House\n}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nProducer [[Arnold Kopelson]] was attracted to ''Murder at 1600'', having said that \"lately, the White House has been vulnerable to a surprisingly wide variety of assaults,\" and along with producer Arnon Milchan offered the script to director [[Dwight Little]], who accepted as despite his action film experience he had never made a suspense film, \"and [[political thriller]]s are probably my favorite movie genre; I love those seminal conspiracy movies of the '70s.\"\n\n===Casting===\nThe filmmakers then invited [[Wesley Snipes]], considering him to have the physicality, intelligence and humor required for Harlan Regis, and Snipes accepted for the depth of the character and \"the opportunity to do a suspense role, which is usually reserved for more mature actors.\" [[Diane Lane]] was attracted by the role of Agent Chance because \"she stands by her personal code,\" and Lane had the markswoman experience required for the role.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.filmscouts.com/scripts/matinee.cfm?Film=mur-160&File=productn|title=Murder at 1600 - About The Production|website=www.filmscouts.com}}</ref>\n\n===Filming===\nAlthough scenes were filmed in Washington, D.C., primary locations were in [[Toronto|Toronto, Canada]] and nearby locations in [[Ontario]]. As ''[[Absolute Power (film)|Absolute Power]]'' was occupying the [[Oval Office]] set built for ''[[Dave (film)|Dave]]'', a new Oval Office was  built at [[Cinespace Film Studios#Kleinburg|Cinespace Film Studios]] in [[Kleinburg]]. The film crew made many visits to the White House for reference in making what production designer Nelson Coates described as \"the most architecturally accurate\" recreation of the room. The Oval Office still stands at the studio, and has been used in productions such as ''[[Dick (film)|Dick]]'' and ''[[The Sentinel (2006 film)|The Sentinel]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/04/13/movies/oval-offices-by-way-of-hollywood.html|title=Oval Offices, by Way of Hollywood|first=Linda|last=Lee}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://torontoist.com/2009/11/reel_toronto_murder_at_1600/|title=Reel Toronto: Murder at 1600|last=Torontoist|date=25 November 2009}}</ref>\n\n==Release==\n===Theatrical===\n''Murder at 1600'' premiered in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]] on April 14, 1997.\n\n==Reception==\n=== Box office ===\nThe film was a box office disappointment.
