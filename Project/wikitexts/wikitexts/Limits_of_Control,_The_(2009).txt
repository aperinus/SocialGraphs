The mission itself is left unstated and the instructions are cryptic, including such phrases as \"Everything is subjective,\" \"The universe has no center and no edges; reality is arbitrary,\" and \"Use your imagination and your skills.\" After the meeting in the airport he travels to [[Madrid]] and then on to [[Seville]], meeting several people in caf\u00e9s and on trains along the way.\n\nEach meeting has the same pattern: he orders two espressos at a cafe and waits, his contact arrives and in Spanish asks, \"You don't speak Spanish, right?\" in different ways, to which he responds, \"No.\" The contacts tell him about their individual interests such as molecules, art, or film, then the two of them exchange matchboxes. A code written on a small piece of paper is inside each matchbox, which Lone Man reads and then eats. These coded messages lead him to his next rendezvous.\n\nHe repeatedly encounters a woman ([[Paz de la Huerta]]) who is always either completely nude or wearing only a transparent raincoat. She invites him to have sex with her but he declines, stating that he never has sex while he is working. One phrase that Creole, the man in the airport tells him is repeated throughout the movie: \"He who thinks he is bigger than the rest must go to the cemetery. There he will see what life really is: a handful of dirt.\" This phrase is sung in a [[peteneras]]<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|last=Macaulay|first=Scott|date=2009-05-01|title=Jim Jarmusch and the music of The Limits of Control|url=https://www.focusfeatures.com/article/jim_jarmusch_and_the_music_of_the_limits_of_control|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100912222712/http://www.focusfeatures.com/article/jim_jarmusch_and_the_music_of_the_limits_of_control|archive-date=2010-09-12|access-date=2021-06-15|website=Focus Features|language=en}}</ref> [[flamenco]] song in a club in [[Seville]] at one point in his journey.\n\nIn [[Almer\u00eda]], he is given a ride in a pickup truck - driven by a companion of the Mexican ([[Gael Garc\u00eda Bernal]]) - on which the words ''La vida no vale nada'' ('life is worth nothing') are painted, a phrase Guitar ([[John Hurt]]) says to him in [[Seville]], and he is taken to [[Tabernas]] desert. There lies a fortified and heavily guarded compound. After observing the compound from afar, he somehow penetrates its defenses and waits for his target inside the target's office.

Which is the absolute opposite of the American way of approaching... \"okay, what demographic, what do they want, what do they expect, give it to them.\" It was like, let's see, can we make an action film with no action in it? Can we make a narrative where the plot is just like a series of repeated variations on something? Can we have a film with characters that have no background, no past, no present, no name, we don't know what they represent, they're metaphorical? These are all the things that people expect, so we were trying to remove the things that they would expect, with the predictable results, in the United States, of not a whole lot of people being interested in the film.

Isaach de Bankol\u00e9 was to play a quiet centred criminal in the [[Torres Blancas]] apartment tower that Jarmusch himself first visited in the 80s. The filming was started with only what Jarmusch calls 'a minimal map', a 25-page story. The dialogues were filled in the night before each scene was shot.<ref name=\"NYTimes_Interview\">{{cite web |last1=Lim |first1=Dennis |title=A Director Content to Wander On |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/26/movies/26lim.html |website=The New York Times |access-date=3 August 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111007040744/https://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/26/movies/26lim.html |archive-date=7 October 2011 |date=23 April 2009 |url-status=live}}</ref> This was in fact the first of Jarmusch's films that took place entirely outside of the United States<ref name=\"Telegraph_Interview\" /> and there were some plans for the filming locations beginning in Madrid, then taking train south to Seville  and finally southeast to desert near the coastal town of Alm\u00e9ria.<ref name=\"NYTimes_Interview\" />\n \nJarmusch cites novels about a professional criminal called [[Parker (Stark novels character)|Parker]] written by [[Richard Stark#Pseudonyms|Richard Stark]] as an inspiration and also mentions that he loves [[John Boorman]]\u2019s 1967 film ''[[Point Blank (1967 film)|Point Blank]]'' which was based on those novels.<ref name=\"Telegraph_Interview\" />  [[Jacques Rivette]]'s films were also used as inspiration for the plot full of disorienting cryptic clues with no clear solution. The tile ''The Limits of Control'' comes from an essay of the same name by [[William S. Burroughs]], which Jarmusch notes that he likes the double sense of: \"Is it the limits to our own self-control? Or is it the limits to which they can control us, 'they' being whoever tries to inject some kind of reality over us?\"<ref name=\"NYTimes_Interview\" />  Jarmusch also employed the [[Oblique Strategies]] created by musician [[Brian Eno]] to reassure himself in the creative process, specifically the using phrases \"Are these sections considered transitions?\", \"Emphasize repetitions.\", and \"Look closely at the most interesting details and amplify them,\" all of which were explicitly naming processes that they were doing during the filmmaking.<ref name=\"Wire_Interview\" />\n\nMany small details in the film have personal significance for Jarmusch. He had received the 'Le Boxeur' matchboxes as a gift, first from musicologist [[Louis Sarno]], then from Isaach de Bankol\u00e9. The black pickup truck with the words \"La Vida No Vale Nada\" written on its back was modeled after a truck owned by [[Joe Strummer]] of the Clash, who had lived for some time in the south of Spain and also appeared in Jarmusch's 1989 film [[Mystery Train (film)|Mystery Train]].<ref name=\"NYTimes_Interview\" />\n\nThe aim of the film according to Jarmusch was to create an \"action film with no action\" and a \"film with suspense but no drama\". He states that the film has a rather [[cubism|cubist]] nature, is \"interpretable in different ways, and they\u2019re all valid,\" and that it is not his job to know what the film means.<ref name=\"NYTimes_Interview\" />\n\n==Soundtrack==\nThe soundtrack is created out of existing music selected by the director Jim Jarmusch. It includes [[drone-doom]] bands Boris and Sunn O))), [[Tempo#Basic tempo markings|adagio]] classical music as well as [[peteneras]] flamenco. For scenes that no suitable music could be found, Jarmusch's own band [[Jim Jarmusch#Music|Bad Rabbit]] recorded new songs. The common characteristics of the used music is its overall slowness and rich musical landscape. Black Angel's \"You on the Run\" was even slowed down while maintaining the pitch to better fit the rest of the soundtrack. Music served as the inspiration for the atmosphere and editing of the film, guitar that appears in the story should represent a guitar that was used in 1920s by Manuel El Sevillano to record \"Por Compasi\u00f3n: Malague\u00f1as\", lyrics form \"El Que Se Tenga Por Grande\" are referenced throughout the film.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n{{Tracklist\n| collapsed       =\n| headline        = \n| extra_column    = Artist\n\n| title1          = Intro\n| note1           = \n| extra1          = Bad Rabbit\n| length1         = 0:13\n\n| title2          = Fuzzy Reactor\n| note2           = \n| extra2          = [[Boris (band)|Boris]] with [[Michio Kurihara]]\n| length2         = 3:42\n\n| title3          = Saeta\n| note3           = \n| extra3          = La Macarena\n| length3         = 2:17\n\n| title4          = Sea Green Sea\n| note4           = \n| extra4          = Bad Rabbit\n| length4         = 4:11\n\n| title5          = Feedbacker \n| note5           = TLOC Edit\n| extra5          = Boris\n| length5         = 3:32\n\n| title6          = Por Compasi\u00f3n: Malague\u00f1as\n| note6           = \n| extra6          = Manuel el Sevillano\n| length6         = 2:03\n\n| title7          = Farewell\n| note7           = \n| extra7          = Boris\n| length7         = 7:29\n\n| title8          = N.L.T.\n| note8           = \n| extra8          = [[Sunn O)))]] & Boris\n| length8         = 3:46\n\n| title9          = El Que Se Tenga Por Grande\n| note9           = \n| extra9          = [[Carmen Linares]]\n| length9         = 3:21\n\n| title10         = Dawn\n| note10          = \n| extra10         = Bad Rabbit\n| length10        = 1:41\n\n| title11         = You on the Run\n| note11          = \n| extra11         = [[The Black Angels (band)|The Black Angels]]\n| length11        = 4:50\n\n| title12         = Omens and Portents 1: The Driver \n| note12          = TLOC Edit\n| extra12         = [[Earth (American band)|Earth]] and [[Bill Frisell]]\n| length12        = 2:44\n\n| title13         = El Que Se Tenga Por Grande\n| note13          = \n| extra13         = Taleg\u00f3n de C\u00f3rdoba & Jorge Rodr\u00edguez Padilla\n| length13        = 3:54\n\n| title14         = Blood Swamp \n| note14          = TLOC Edit\n| extra14         = Sunn O))) & Boris\n| length14        = 4:33\n\n| title15         = Schubert, Adagio from [[String Quintet (Schubert)|String Quintet in C]], D.956\n| note15          = TLOC Edit\n| extra15         = [[Villa Musica|Ensemble Villa Musica]]\n| length15        = 5:16\n\n| title16         = [[Daft Punk Is Playing at My House]]\n| note16          = \n| extra16         = [[LCD Soundsystem]]\n| length16        = 5:15\n\n| title17         = \n| note17          = TLOC Edit\n| extra17         = Boris\n| length17        = 1:04\n\n}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|1}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{AllRovi movie|423594|The Limits of Control}}\n* {{mojo title|id=limitsofcontrol|title=The Limits of Control}}\n* {{IMDb title|id=1135092|title=The Limits of Control}}\n* {{rotten-tomatoes|id=limits_of_control|title=The Limits of Control}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20090217131253/http://jim-jarmusch.net/films/the_limits_of_control/ ''The Limits of Control''] at The Jim Jarmusch Resource Page\n* [http://www.loslimitesdelcontrol.es/ ''Los Limites del Control''] Spanish Site\n\n{{Jim Jarmusch}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Limits Of Control}}\n[[Category:2009 films]]\n[[Category:2009 crime drama films]]\n[[Category:2000s mystery films]]\n[[Category:American crime drama films]]\n[[Category:American mystery films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Jim Jarmusch]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Madrid]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Almer\u00eda]]\n[[Category:Focus Features films]]\n[[Category:2000s English-language films]]\n[[Category:2000s American films]]"}]}}}}
