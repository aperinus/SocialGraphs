The film is a joint production of Argentine and Spanish companies.<ref name=\"THR\" />\n\nUsing a [[nonlinear narrative]], the film depicts a [[Judicial power|judiciary employee]] and his boss, a [[law clerk]], in 1974, played by [[Ricardo Dar\u00edn]] and [[Soledad Villamil]], respectively, as they investigate a rape and murder case, while also following the characters 25 years later reminiscing over the case and unearthing the buried romance between them.<ref name=\"GuardianReview\" />\n\nThe film received awards in both Hollywood and Spain, notably the [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film]] at the [[82nd Academy Awards]], making Argentina, with 1985's ''[[The Official Story]]'', the first country in Latin America to win it twice.<ref name=\"FirstTwice\" /><ref name=\"OscarWin\" /> Three weeks before, it had received the Spanish equivalent with the [[Goya Award for Best Spanish Language Foreign Film]].<ref name=\"BAHerald\" /> At the time of its release, it became the second highest-grossing film in Argentine history, surpassed only by 1975's ''[[Nazareno Cruz and the Wolf]]''.<ref name=\"Favio\" /><ref name=\"Record\" />\n\nIn 2016, ''The Secret in Their Eyes'' was ranked No. 91 by international critics for the [[BBC's 100 Greatest Films of the 21st Century]].<ref name=\"BBCGreatest21\" />\n\n==Plot==\nIn June 1974, judiciary agent Benjamin Esp\u00f3sito investigates the rape and murder of Liliana Colotto de Morales. Esp\u00f3sito promises her husband, Ricardo, he will find the killer and give him a [[Life imprisonment|life sentence]]. Esp\u00f3sito is helped by his alcoholic partner Pablo Sand\u00f3val and the new department chief Irene Men\u00e9ndez-Hastings. Romano, Esp\u00f3sito's rival, accuses two immigrant workers of the murder, which angers Esp\u00f3sito upon discovering that both of them were tortured to obtain a confession.\n\nEsp\u00f3sito finds a lead while looking at old photos of Liliana, which Ricardo gave him: many of them featured a man, identified as Isidoro G\u00f3mez, staring at her suspiciously. Esp\u00f3sito and Sand\u00f3val sneak into G\u00f3mez's mother's house in [[Chivilcoy]]. During the break-in, they find some letters from G\u00f3mez to his mother. Sand\u00f3val steals them and Esp\u00f3sito finds out after returning to Buenos Aires. Their \"visit\" only causes them trouble with their higher-ups, and they are unable to find any evidence in the letters. G\u00f3mez is still on the loose due to a careless phone call from Ricardo to G\u00f3mez's mother, in a desperate quest for his wife's killer. Ultimately, the case is closed.\n\nIn 1975, Esp\u00f3sito finds Ricardo in a train station in [[Retiro, Buenos Aires|Retiro]] and discovers that he was trying to find G\u00f3mez in multiple stations. Esp\u00f3sito convinces Men\u00e9ndez to reopen the investigation. Meanwhile, while getting drunk in a bar, Sand\u00f3val makes a discovery: an acquaintance of his identifies several names on the letters \u2013 seemingly without any connection \u2013 as footballers of [[Racing Club de Avellaneda|Racing Football Club]]. After identifying him as a Racing fan, Esp\u00f3sito and Sand\u00f3val attend a game between Racing and [[Club Atl\u00e9tico Hurac\u00e1n|Hurac\u00e1n]], in hopes of finding G\u00f3mez.\n\nWhile keeping an eye on the game's attendees in [[Estadio Tom\u00e1s Adolfo Duc\u00f3|Hurac\u00e1n's stadium]], Esp\u00f3sito and Sand\u00f3val locate G\u00f3mez among the crowd, but a sudden [[Scoring in association football|goal]] causes a hubbub and allows G\u00f3mez to flee. A chase ensues and G\u00f3mez is caught by the stadium's security guards as he invades the pitch. Esp\u00f3sito and Men\u00e9ndez then grill him illegally, and Men\u00e9ndez makes G\u00f3mez confess by calling him physically weak, and attacking his masculinity. G\u00f3mez is tried and sentenced, but Romano bails him out one month later in order to get revenge on Esp\u00f3sito and hires him as a [[Contract killing|hitman]] for the right-wing faction of the [[Justicialist Party|Peronist Party]]. Esp\u00f3sito and Men\u00e9ndez try to reverse it but are stopped by Romano's intervention. Esp\u00f3sito informs Morales that his wife's killer will never go to prison.\n\nWeeks later, Sand\u00f3val gets in a bar fight, causing Esp\u00f3sito to take him to his flat and fetch his wife. They find the door pried open, his pictures flipped over and Sand\u00f3val shot dead in his room. Esp\u00f3sito soon concludes that G\u00f3mez/Romano sent assassins after him, but Sand\u00f3val impersonated him to protect his friend. Fearing for his life, Esp\u00f3sito goes into hiding for 10 years in [[Jujuy Province]] with Men\u00e9ndez's cousins. Esp\u00f3sito returns to Buenos Aires in 1985 to find G\u00f3mez missing and Men\u00e9ndez married with two children.\n\nIn 1999, Esp\u00f3sito tries to make sense out of the case and visits Ricardo, who moved in 1975 to an isolated cottage in a rural area of the [[Buenos Aires Province]]. Ricardo loses control when Esp\u00f3sito asks him how he coped with his wife's death and the unfair end of the investigation since G\u00f3mez was never seen again after becoming part of [[Isabel Per\u00f3n]]\u2019s security detail. Ricardo tells Esp\u00f3sito that he kidnapped and murdered G\u00f3mez years earlier, and Esp\u00f3sito leaves. Moments later, however, he remembers Ricardo not wanting an easy death for G\u00f3mez decades ago, and Esp\u00f3sito sneaks back to Ricardo\u2019s house, where he finds Ricardo giving food to G\u00f3mez, whom he has kept imprisoned for 25 years in complete isolation, without ever talking to him. G\u00f3mez begs Esp\u00f3sito for human contact. Ricardo tells Esp\u00f3sito he promised him \"a life sentence\" as he staggers out.\n\nBack in Buenos Aires, Esp\u00f3sito visits Sand\u00f3val's grave for the first time. He then goes to Irene's office, ready to confess his love to her, something she was always expecting. Smiling, she tells him to close the door.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Ricardo Dar\u00edn]] as Benjam\u00edn Esp\u00f3sito, a [[Judicial power|judiciary employee]] in charge of solving the rape and murder of Liliana Coloto\n* [[Soledad Villamil]] as Irene Men\u00e9ndez Hastings, a judge and Esp\u00f3sito's superior, who helps him with his investigation\n* [[Pablo Rago]] as Ricardo Morales, Lliliana Coloto's grieving widower\n* [[Javier Godino]] as Isidoro G\u00f3mez\n* [[Guillermo Francella]] as Pablo Sandoval, Esp\u00f3sito's alcoholic friend and assistant\n* {{illm|Mario Alarc\u00f3n|es|Mario Alarc\u00f3n}} as Judge Fortuna\n* [[Mariano Argento]] as Romano\n* {{illm|Jos\u00e9 Luis Gioia|es|Jos\u00e9 Luis Gioia}} as Inspector B\u00e1ez\n* [[Carla Quevedo]] as Liliana Coloto\n\n== Historical and political context==\nThe setting of the film ties its characters to the political situation in Argentina in two different time periods: 1975 and 1999. The main events transpire in 1975, a year before the start of Argentina's [[National Reorganization Process|last civil-military dictatorship]] (1976\u20131983); the final year of the presidency of [[Isabel Per\u00f3n]] saw great political turmoil, with both leftist violence and [[state-sponsored terrorism|state-sponsored terrorist organization]], especially at the hands of the [[Argentine Anticommunist Alliance]] (usually known as Triple A or AAA), a far-right [[death squad]] founded in 1973 and particularly active under Isabel Per\u00f3n's rule (1974\u20131976). A [[Coup d'\u00e9tat|military coup]] in 1976 triggered the so-called \"[[Dirty War]]\", which is foreshadowed in the character of Isidoro Gomez and his protection by the government due to his work helping that administration and its [[Argentine law|judicial system]] to find (and later kill) left-wing activists and militants or [[guerrilla]] members.<ref name=\"Cineaste\"/> The dictatorship's ''National Reorganization Process'' was a period of more than seven years (1976\u20131983) marred by widespread [[human rights violations]].<ref>CONADEP, Nunca M\u00e1s Report, Chapter II, Section One:''Advertencia'', [http://www.desaparecidos.org/arg/conadep/nuncamas/] {{in lang|es}}</ref><ref>[https://www.hmh.org/la_Genocide_Argentina.shtml Atrocities in Argentina (1976\u20131983)] [[Holocaust Museum Houston]]</ref> The state-sponsored terrorism of the military ''Junta'' created a climate of violence whose victims were in the thousands and included left-wing activists and militants, intellectuals and artists, [[trade union]]ists, high school and college/university students and journalists, as well as [[Marxist]]s, [[Peronism|Peronist]] guerrillas or alleged sympathizers of both.<ref name=\"WashingtonPost\"/>\n\nIt is estimated that some 10,000 of the disappeared were guerrillas of the [[Montoneros]] (MPM), the oldest guerrilla organization, which began to operate in 1970, and the [[People's Revolutionary Army (Argentina)|People's Revolutionary Army]] (ERP).<ref name=\"elmundo.es\">[http://www.elmundo.es/papel/hemeroteca/1995/05/04/mundo/40472.html El ex l\u00edder de los Montoneros entona un \u00abmea culpa\u00bb parcial de su pasado], ''El Mundo'', 4 May 1995</ref><ref name=\"Cedema.org\">{{Cite book|url=http://www.cedema.org/ver.php?id=2713 |title=A 32 a\u00f1os de la ca\u00edda en combate de Mario Roberto Santucho y la Direcci\u00f3n Hist\u00f3rica del PRT-ERP |publisher=Cedema.org}}</ref><ref name=\"HeinzFr\u00fchling1999\">{{cite book|author1=Wolfgang S.

By 1985 the government had promoted the [[Trial of the Juntas]], which prosecuted and condemned the men who were at the top of the military hierarchies during the country's last dictatorship, stopping short of prosecuting the other militars and civilians who were also responsible for the period's crimes.\n\nThe second period portrayed is 1999, during the last days of [[Carlos Menem]]'s administration. During this time, the national laws known as [[Full stop law|the \"Full stop\" law]] (\"Ley de Punto Final\") and [[Law of Due Obedience|Due Obedience]] \u2013 sanctioned during the 1980s \u2013 were still in effect. These legal elements, popularly known as \"the amnesty laws\", had effectively blocked the investigation of thousands of cases of human rights abuses committed during the time of the country's last dictatorship. This period of Argentina's history is shown to stress the predicament in which the character of Ricardo Morales lived, since the impunity that criminals and human rights abusers like G\u00f3mez enjoyed at the time prevented Morales to bring the former to justice: the penal system would have convicted Morales for his past actions. At the same time, many former torturers and murderers of the dictatorship \u2013 who had previously been friends or partners of G\u00f3mez \u2013 were free at the time, and would have likely taken revenge on Morales. This fact further explains why Morales isolated and locked himself up with G\u00f3mez for so many years.\n\nIn 2003 [[Human rights in Argentina|the political climate changed]], and during President [[Nestor Kirchner]]'s administration, the Full Stop and Due Obedience laws, along with the executive pardons, were declared [[null and void]], first by the [[Argentine Congress|Congress]] and then by the [[Argentine Supreme Court|Supreme Court]]. These changes, promoted by the government in 2005,<ref>[https://www.hrw.org/news/2005/06/14/argentina-amnesty-laws-struck-down Argentina: Amnesty Laws Struck Down] 14 June 2005 - [[Human Rights Watch]]</ref> enabled the judicial power to prosecute and trial all the orchestrators of [[State-sponsored terrorism]], also including politically motivated criminal acts committed between 1975 and 1983.

It marked his fourth collaboration with actor-friend Ricardo Dar\u00edn, who had previously starred in all three of Campanella's Argentine-produced films in the lead role. Frequent collaborator [[Eduardo Blanco (actor)|Eduardo Blanco]], however, is not featured in the movie; the part of Dar\u00edn's character's friend is played instead by comedian [[Guillermo Francella]].<ref name=\"GoyaWin\" />\n\nIn addition to presenting the appropriate ambiance for Argentina in the mid-1970s, it features a formidable technical achievement in creating a continuous five-minute-long shot (designed by [[visual effects]] supervisor Rodrigo S. Tomasso), that encompasses an entire stadium during a live football match. From a standard aerial overview we approach the stadium, dive in, cross the field between the players mid-match and find the protagonist in the crowd, then take a circular move around him and follow him as he shuffles through the stands until he finds the suspect, continuing with a feverish stop-and-go chase on foot through the murky rooms and corridors beneath the stands, finally ending under the lights in the middle of the pitch. The scene was filmed in the [[Estadio Tom\u00e1s Adolfo Duc\u00f3|stadium]] of football club [[Club Atl\u00e9tico Hurac\u00e1n|Hurac\u00e1n]], and took three months of pre-production, three days of shooting and nine months of post-production.
