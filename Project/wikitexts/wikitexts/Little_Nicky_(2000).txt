The film depicts the son of Satan and an angel who is tasked with returning his two brothers to Hell and preventing them from destroying the boundary between good and evil on Earth.\n\nThe film received negative reviews from critics and was a [[Box-office bomb|box office bomb]], grossing $58.3 million against an $80\u201385 million budget.\n\n==Plot==\nWith his 10,000 year reign coming to an end and after torturing [[Adolf Hitler]] by shoving a [[pineapple]] up his rump, [[Satan]] must decide which of his three sons will succeed him as ruler of [[Hell]]. Adrian is the most devious, Cassius is the cruelest, and Nicky is the kindest. Adrian and Cassius claim that Nicky's mother is a goat and torment him by [[Psychokinesis|controlling his body with their minds]]. Nicky has had a [[speech impediment]] and a disfigured jaw since Cassius hit him in the face with a shovel. Satan assembles his sons to tell them that they are not yet ready to succeed him as he will continue ruling Hell.\n\nAngered by this decision, Adrian and Cassius travel to [[Earth]] to create a new Hell by possessing religious and political leaders in [[New York City]]. As they leave, they freeze the entrance to Hell, preventing more evil souls from entering and causing Satan to begin to disintegrate. Stanley the Gatekeeper informs Satan of this and Satan punishes him by growing breasts on his head and giving him to his father [[Lucifer]]. To stop Adrian and Cassius, he sends Nicky to Earth with a silver [[Hip flask|flask]] that traps whoever drinks from it inside.\n\nNicky has difficulty surviving on Earth and he is killed several times, landing in Hell and returning to New York each time. While learning how to eat and sleep, he meets a [[Spirit possession|possessed]], talking [[bulldog]] named Mr. Beefy, rents an apartment with an actor named Todd, and falls in love with a design student named Valerie Veran. Nicky encounters Adrian, but fails to capture him and scares Valerie away. Nicky then observes Cassius on television possessing the referee of a [[Harlem Globetrotters]] game. Nicky arrives at the game and successfully tricks Cassius into the flask. [[Satanism|Satanist]] [[Heavy metal subculture|metalheads]] John and Peter swear loyalty to Nicky. That evening, Nicky apologizes to Valerie and they reconcile.\n\nThe following day, Adrian possesses the [[Chief of Police|Chief]] of the [[New York City Police Department|NYPD]] and accuses Nicky of [[mass murder]]. Nicky has Todd kill him so he can go back to Hell and ask his father for advice, but Satan has trouble hearing because his ears have fallen off, and his assistants are panicking because the deadline to capture Adrian and Cassius is approaching. Back on Earth, Nicky and his friends devise a plan to capture Adrian in a [[New York City Subway|subway station]], but Adrian discovers their trick and, in the ensuing fight, grabs Valerie and dives onto the track as a train approaches, but Nicky throws her aside, leaving himself and Adrian to be killed by the train.\n\nArriving in Hell just minutes before midnight, Adrian begins taking over Hell by pushing what remains of his father aside and sitting on the throne, rising to [[Central Park]], and starting a riotous party. Meanwhile, Nicky wakes up in [[Heaven]] as a reward for sacrificing himself and meets his mother Holly, an [[angel]] who tells him that he can defeat Adrian with the \"[[Good|inner light]]\" that he inherited from her. After she gives him a mysterious orb, he confronts Adrian in Central Park where he covers [[Henry Winkler]] in bees. Adrian appears to win the battle by transforming into a [[bat]] and locking Nicky in the flask. However, Nicky escapes from the flask and shatters the orb, causing [[Ozzy Osbourne]] to appear, bite Adrian's head off, and spit it into the flask.\n\nWith his brothers captured, Nicky prepares to save his father. After he re-covers Winkler in bees to make sure he goes to Hell, he and Valerie express their love for each other and she kills him. In Hell, Satan regains his body and suggests Nicky stay with Valerie to maintain things in the middle while stating to Holly that he still loves her. In the presence of Nicky and Lucifer, Satan then shoves the flask containing Adrian and Cassius up Hitler's rump.\n\nOne year later, Nicky and Valerie live in New York with their infant son named Zachariah who has [[demon]]ic powers.\n\nA postscript states that Valerie struck Nicky with a shovel which fixed his jaw disfigurement. Satan and Holly continue their long distance relationship where Holly's fitness instructor is mentioned to be [[Chris Farley]]. Zachariah was suspended from the nursery after turning another kid's bottle of milk into moose urine. Todd started his one man show in which only a demon from Hell attended. Mr. Beefy reunited with his rat girlfriend and they had kids. Stanley the Gatekeeper and Gary the Monster also had kids of their own. John and Peter die in a plane crash and end up happily in Hell as honored residents who have been given Nicky's old bedroom to party in.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Adam Sandler]] as Nicky, the youngest son of Satan and an angel named Holly.\n* [[Patricia Arquette]] as Valerie Veran, a design student that Nicky falls for.\n* [[Harvey Keitel]] as [[Satan]], the ruler of Hell who is the father of Nicky, Adrian, and Cassius.\n* [[Rhys Ifans]] as Adrian, the devious firstborn of Satan.\n* [[Tom Lister Jr.|Tommy \"Tiny\" Lister Jr.]] as Cassius, the brutish second son of Satan.\n* [[Rodney Dangerfield]] as [[Lucifer]], Nicky, Adrian, and Cassius's grandfather and Satan's father who created Hell.\n* [[Robert Smigel]] as the voice of Mr. Beefy, a possessed bulldog and an old friend of Satan that Nicky befriends.\n* [[Reese Witherspoon]] as Holly, an angel who is Nicky's mother.\n* [[Allen Covert]] as Todd, an actor that Nicky befriends.\n* [[Jonathan Loughran]] as John, a Satanist metalhead that befriends Nicky.\n* [[Peter Dante]] as Peter, a Satanist metalhead and friend of John that befriends Nicky.\n* [[Blake Clark]] as Jimmy, a demon who is one of Satan's advisors.\n* [[Kevin Nealon]] as Stanley \"Tit-Head\", the Gatekeeper of Hell who Satan manifested breasts on top of his head after he mentioned that he couldn't stop Adrian and Cassius from leaving Hell.\n* [[Dana Carvey]] as Whitey Duvall, the referee.
