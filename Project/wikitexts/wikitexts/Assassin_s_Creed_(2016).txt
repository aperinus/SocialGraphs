The film is directed by [[Justin Kurzel]], written by [[Michael Lesslie]], Adam Cooper and Bill Collage, and stars [[Michael Fassbender]] (who also produced), as well as [[Marion Cotillard]], [[Jeremy Irons]], [[Brendan Gleeson]], [[Charlotte Rampling]] and [[Michael K. Williams]]. The film is set in the same universe as the video games but features an original story that expands the series' mythology. The plot revolves around Callum \"Cal\" Lynch (Fassbender), who is abducted by the Abstergo Foundation because of his heritage. Cal's ancestor, Aguilar de Nerha, was a member of the Assassin Brotherhood\u2014a fictional organization inspired by the real-life [[Order of Assassins]]\u2014active during the [[Spanish Inquisition]] in the late 15th-century, who swore to protect the Apple of Eden, an artifact believed to contain the key to humanity's [[free will]]. Cal must accept his Assassin heritage and stop Abstergo, the [[Knights Templar|Templar Order]] of the modern-day, from finding the Apple and using it to enslave humanity.\n\nFilming began in late August 2015 and concluded in January 2016. ''Assassin's Creed'' was released on December 21, 2016, in the United States and France.

In 1986, adolescent Callum \"Cal\" Lynch finds his mother killed by his father, Joseph, a modern-day Assassin. Gunmen led by Alan Rikkin, CEO of the Templars' Abstergo Foundation, arrive to capture Joseph, who persuades his son to escape.\n\nIn 2016, Cal is sentenced to death for murdering a [[Procuring (prostitution)|pimp]], but Abstergo fakes his execution and takes him to their research facility in [[Madrid]]. He is told the Templars are searching for an [[Apple of Eden]], one of many artifacts built by a long-lost civilization, in order to eliminate violence by using the Apple's code to control humanity's [[free will]]. Sofia, Alan's daughter and the head scientist, reveals that Cal is a descendant of Aguilar, the last person confirmed to be in possession of the Apple. She puts Cal in the Animus, a machine which allows him to relive (and the scientists to observe) Aguilar's [[Genetic memory (psychology)|genetic memories]], so that Abstergo can learn the Apple's whereabouts.\n\nIn 1492, Aguilar and his partner, Maria, are deployed to rescue Ahmed, who has been kidnapped by the Templar Grand Master [[Tom\u00e1s de Torquemada|Tomas de Torquemada]], to coerce Ahmed's father, Sultan [[Muhammad XII of Granada|Muhammad XII]], to surrender the Apple. Aguilar and Maria intercept the Templars, but are overpowered and captured by Torquemada's enforcer, Ojeda. Cal is quickly pulled out of the Animus by Sofia.\n\nCal encounters other Assassin descendants held captive at the facility, most of whom are suspicious of his motives, with the exceptions of Lin, a descendant of 16th-century [[Chinese people|Chinese]] Assassin [[Shao Jun]]; and Moussa, a descendant of 18th-century [[Haiti]]an Assassin Baptiste. Cal begins experiencing hallucinations, dubbed \"the Bleeding Effect\", of both Aguilar and Joseph. Cal and Sofia build a rapport during their sessions; she confides that her mother was likewise murdered by an Assassin, sharing his hatred of the Brotherhood .\n\nBack in the Animus, Aguilar and Maria are scheduled for execution at an [[auto da fe]] but he manages to free them, leading to a rooftop chase in which they escape through a [[#Connections to the video games|\"Leap of Faith\"]]. Cal's mind reacts violently to the session and he is temporarily paralyzed. When Cal learns that Joseph is also at the facility, he confronts him over his mother's death. Joseph informs Cal that the Bleeding Effect will allow him to gain Aguilar's skills. He also reveals that Cal's mother was an Assassin, and she chose to die by Joseph's hand rather than be forced into the Animus. Unconvinced, Cal vows to destroy the Assassins by finding the Apple. Meanwhile, Alan is pressed by a Templar Elder, Ellen Kaye, to shut down the multibillion-dollar Animus Project because they have already \"won ... people no longer care about their civil liberties ... they're content to follow\", leading Sofia to question her father's true intentions.\n\nReaffirmed by his encounter with Joseph, Cal willingly enters the Animus. Aguilar and Maria ambush a meeting between Muhammad and Torquemada; they kill Torquemada's men and recover the Apple, but Ojeda captures Maria. She chooses to die to protect the Apple and stabs herself on Ojeda's blade, allowing Aguilar to kill Ojeda and escape through another Leap; the force of which causes the Animus to violently malfunction. Aguilar later gives the Apple to [[Christopher Columbus]], who vows to take it to his grave. When Moussa and the modern Assassin prisoners start a riot in order to escape, Alan orders the facility purged. Abstergo security kills Joseph and most of the other prisoners. Cal stands in the Animus chamber and is met with projections of his ancestors, including Aguilar, [[Arno Dorian]], Joseph and his mother, while Sofia glimpses the projection of an Assassin resembling her. Persuaded by his mother, Cal embraces his Assassin heritage and, having fully assimilated Aguilar's abilities, joins Moussa and Lin in escaping the facility.\n\nHaving retrieved the Apple from Columbus' burial vault, the Templars convene at a ceremony in their London sanctuary to celebrate their triumph. Inside the sanctuary, a disillusioned Sofia meets Cal, who has come to take the Apple, and she reluctantly allows him to act. Cal retrieves the Apple, killing Alan in the process. As Sofia vows revenge, the Assassins depart, swearing once again to protect the Apple from the Templars.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Michael Fassbender]] as Callum \"Cal\" Lynch and Aguilar de Nerha:<ref name=\"characters_bio\"/><br />An original character created for the film, Cal is a descendant of the Assassins, with genetic links to Aguilar, an Assassin active in 15th-century Spain.<ref name=\"FassbenderStar\"/><ref name=\"FassbenderRole\">{{cite web|last1=Doty|first1=Meriah|title='Assassin's Creed' First Look: Here's Michael Fassbender as Brand New Character (Exclusive)|url=https://www.yahoo.com/movies/assassins-creed-first-look-heres-michael-127715456582.html|website=[[Yahoo!
