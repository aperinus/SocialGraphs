Bill persuades Abby to claim the fortune of the dying farmer by tricking him into a false marriage.\n\n''Days of Heaven'' was Malick's second feature film, after ''[[Badlands (film)|Badlands]]'' (1973), and was produced on a budget of $3 million. Production was particularly troublesome, with a tight shooting schedule in Canada in 1976 and significant budget constraints. Film editing took Malick a lengthy two years, due to difficulty with achieving a general flow and assembly of the scenes. This was eventually solved by incorporating improvised narration from teen Linda Manz.<ref>[http://www.villagevoice.com/2011-06-01/film/calling-linda-manz Profile of Linda Manz], villagevoice.com, June 1, 2011; accessed August 10, 2014.</ref><ref>[https://www.criterion.com/current/posts/7074-subvert-normality-the-streetwise-voice-of-linda-manz Subvert Normality: The Streetwise Voice of Linda Manz|The Current|The Criterion Collection]</ref> The film was scored by [[Ennio Morricone]] and photographed by [[N\u00e9stor Almendros]] and [[Haskell Wexler]].\n\n''Days of Heaven'' received positive reviews on its original theatrical release.

Bill and Abby pretend to be siblings to prevent gossip. The three are hired as part of a large group of seasonal workers by a rich, shy farmer. Bill overhears a doctor telling the farmer he has only a year to live, although the nature of the illness is not specified.\n\nWhen the farmer falls in love with Abby, Bill encourages her to marry him so they can inherit his money. They thus marry and Bill stays as her \"brother\". The farmer's foreman suspects the scheme. The farmer's health unexpectedly remains stable, foiling Bill's plans. Eventually, the farmer discovers Bill's true relationship with Abby; meanwhile, Abby has begun to fall in love with her husband. When a locust swarm and fires destroy his wheat fields, the incensed farmer chases Bill with a gun, but Bill kills him with a screwdriver, then flees with Abby and Linda.\n\nThe foreman and police pursue and eventually find them; Bill is shot and killed while running. Abby inherits the farmer's estate and leaves Linda at a boarding school. Abby leaves town on a train with soldiers departing for [[World War I]].

He and Malick cast young actors [[Richard Gere]] and [[Brooke Adams (actress)|Brooke Adams]] and actor/playwright [[Sam Shepard]] for the lead roles. [[Paramount Pictures]] CEO [[Barry Diller]] wanted Schneider to produce films for him and agreed to finance ''Days of Heaven''. At the time, the studio was heading in a new direction. They were hiring new production heads who had worked in network television and, according to former production chief [[Richard Sylbert]], \"[manufacturing] product aimed at your knees\".<ref name=\"Biskindbook\"/> Despite the change in direction, Schneider was able to secure a deal with Paramount by guaranteeing the budget and taking personal responsibility for all overages. \"Those were the kind of deals I liked to make&nbsp;... because then I could have final cut and not talk to nobody about why we're gonna use this person instead of that person\", Schneider said.<ref name=\"Biskindbook\"/>\n\nMalick admired cinematographer [[N\u00e9stor Almendros]]' work on ''[[The Wild Child]]'' (1970) and wanted him to shoot ''Days of Heaven''.<ref name=\"Almendros\">Almendros 1986</ref> Almendros was impressed by Malick's knowledge of photography and willingness to use little studio lighting. The two men modeled the film's cinematography after [[silent film]]s, which often used natural light.

The actors had to walk backwards while running the film in reverse through the camera to achieve the effect. When it was projected, everything moved forward except the locusts.]]\n\nAccording to Almendros, the production was not \"rigidly prepared\", allowing for improvisation. Daily call sheets were not very detailed and the schedule changed to suit the weather. This upset some Hollywood crew members not used to working this way. Most of the crew were used to a \"glossy style of photography\" and felt frustrated because Almendros did not give them much work.<ref name=\"Almendros\"/> On a daily basis, he asked them to turn off the lights they had prepared for him. Some crew members said that Almendros and Malick did not know what they were doing. The tension led to some of the crew quitting the production. Malick supported what Almendros was doing and pushed the look of the film further, taking away more lighting aids, and leaving the image bare.<ref name=\"Almendros\"/>\n\nDue to union regulations in North America, Almendros was not allowed to operate the camera. With Malick, he would plan out and rehearse movements of the camera and the actors. Almendros would stand near the main camera and give instructions to the camera operators.<ref name=\"Almendros\"/> Almendros was gradually losing his sight by the time shooting began. To evaluate his set-ups, \"he had one of his assistants take [[Instant film|Polaroids]] of the scene, then examined them through very strong glasses\".<ref name=\"Biskindbook\"/> According to Almendros, Malick wanted \"a very visual movie. The story would be told through visuals. Very few people really want to give that priority to image. Usually the director gives priority to the actors and the story, but here the story was told through images\".<ref name=\"Visions\">{{cite news|last=Glassman|first=Arnold|author2=Todd McCarthy|author3=Stuart Samuels|title=Visions of Light: The Art of Cinematography|publisher=Kino International|year=1992}}</ref>\n\nMuch of the film would be shot during [[golden hour (photography)|magic hour]], which Almendros called: \"a euphemism, because it's not an hour but around 25 minutes at the most. It is the moment when the sun sets, and after the sun sets and before it is night. The sky has light, but there is no actual sun. The light is very soft, and there is something magic about it. It limited us to around twenty minutes a day, but it did pay on the screen. It gave some kind of magic look, a beauty and romanticism.\"<ref name=\"Visions\"/> Lighting was integral to filming, and helped evoke the [[painterly]] quality of the landscapes in the film. A vast majority of the scenes were filmed late in the afternoon or after sunset, with the sky silhouetting the actors faces, which would otherwise be difficult to see.<ref name=\"CriterionCollection\">{{Citation|title=Interview with cinematographer Haskell Wexler|series=\"Days of Heaven: Criterion Collection\" DVD|publisher=[[Criterion Collection]]|year=2007}}</ref> Interior scenes that feature light coming in from the outside, were shot using artificial light to maintain the consistency of that intruding light. The \"magic look\", however, would also extend to interior scenes, which did occasionally utilize natural light.\n\nFor the shot in the \"locusts\" sequence, where the insects rise into the sky, the film-makers dropped [[peanut]] shells from helicopters. They had the actors walk backwards while running the film in reverse through the camera. When it was projected, everything moved forward except the locusts.<ref name=\"Thompson\">{{cite news |last=Thompson |first=Rustin |title=Myth-making With Natural Light |work=Moviemaker |date=June 30, 1998 |url=http://www.moviemaker.com/directing/article/mythmaking_with_natural_light_3206 |access-date=February 13, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110105102855/http://www.moviemaker.com/directing/article/mythmaking_with_natural_light_3206/ |archive-date=January 5, 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref> For the close-ups and insert shots, thousands of live locusts were used which had been captured and supplied by Canada's Department of Agriculture.<ref name=\"Almendros\"/>\n\nWhile the photography yielded the director satisfactory results critically, the rest of the production was difficult from the start.<ref name=\"Biskindbook2\"/> The actors and crew reportedly viewed Malick as cold and distant. After two weeks of shooting, Malick was so disappointed with the dailies, he \"decided to toss the script, go [[Leo Tolstoy]] instead of [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]], wide instead of deep [and] shoot miles of film with the hope of solving the problems in the editing room.\"<ref name=\"Biskindbook2\"/>\n\nThe harvesting machines constantly broke down, which resulted in shooting beginning late in the afternoon, allowing for only a few hours of light before it was too dark to go on. One day, two helicopters were scheduled to drop peanut shells that were to simulate locusts on film; however, Malick decided to shoot period cars instead. He kept the helicopters on hold at great cost. Production was lagging behind, with costs exceeding the $3,000,000 budget by about $800,000, and Schneider had already mortgaged his home in order to cover the overages.<ref name=\"Biskindbook2\"/><ref name=\"Oxford\">{{cite news|last=Looms|first=Jonathan|title=1970's cinema: Hollywood's days of heaven|work=The Oxford Student|date=February 15, 2012|access-date=March 12, 2012|url=http://oxfordstudent.com/2012/02/05/1970s-cinema-hollywoods-days-of-heaven}}</ref>\n\nThe production ran so late that both Almendros and camera operator [[John Bailey (cinematographer)|John Bailey]] had to leave due to a prior commitment on [[Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut]]'s ''[[The Man Who Loved Women (1977 film)|The Man Who Loved Women]]'' (1977). Almendros approached cinematographer [[Haskell Wexler]] to complete the film. They worked together for a week so that Wexler could get familiar with the film's visual style.<ref name=\"Almendros\"/>\n\nWexler was careful to match Almendros' work, but he did make some exceptions. \"I did some hand held shots on a [[Panavision cameras|Panaflex]]\", he said, \"[for] the opening of the film in the steel mill. I used some diffusion. Nestor didn't use any diffusion. I felt very guilty using the diffusion and having the feeling of violating a fellow cameraman.\"<ref name=\"Visions\"/> Although half the finished picture was footage shot by Wexler, he received only credit for \"additional photography\", much to his chagrin. The credit denied him any chance of an Academy Award for his work on ''Days of Heaven''. Wexler sent film critic [[Roger Ebert]] a letter \"in which he described sitting in a theater with a stop-watch to prove that more than half of the footage\" was his.<ref name=\"Ebert\">{{cite news |last=Ebert |first=Roger |title=''Days of Heaven'': Great Movies |work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]] |date=December 7, 1997 |url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19971207/REVIEWS08/401010327/1023 |access-date=September 19, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070925050429/http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F19971207%2FREVIEWS08%2F401010327%2F1023 |archive-date=September 25, 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Later in life, however, he had accepted Almendros receiving credit as cinematographer:\n\n<blockquote>I thought, \"Well, God damn it.

What the hell, Nestor should have it.\" So then I said to myself, \"Well, Haskell, you're being a little selfish.\" And the real thing that convinced me not to say anything&nbsp;... was that Nestor set the tone of the film. It was actually me maintaining his style to a certain extent, so if there was to be an award, which we didn't know there would be, he should get it.

According to editor [[Billy Weber]], Malick jettisoned much of the film's dialogue, replacing it with Manz's voice-over, which served as an oblique commentary on the story.<ref name=\"Biskindbook2\"/> After a year, Malick had to call the actors to [[Los Angeles, California]] to shoot inserts of shots that were necessary but had not been filmed in Alberta. The finished film thus includes [[close-up]]s of Shepard that were shot under a freeway overpass. The underwater shot of Gere's falling face down into the river was shot in a large aquarium in Spacek's living room.<ref name=\"Almereyda\"/>\n\nMeanwhile, Schneider was disappointed with Malick. He had confronted Malick numerous times about missed deadlines and broken promises. Due to further cost overruns, he had to ask Paramount for more money, which he preferred not to do. When they screened a demo for Paramount and made their pitch, the studio was impressed and reportedly \"gave Malick a very sweet deal at the studio, carte blanche, essentially\".<ref name=\"Biskindbook2\"/> Malick was not able to capitalize on the deal. He was so exhausted from working on the film that he moved to Paris with his girlfriend. He tried developing another [[The Tree of Life (film)|project]] for Paramount, but after a substantial amount of work, he abandoned it. He did not make another film until 1998's ''[[The Thin Red Line (1998 film)|The Thin Red Line]]'' 20 years later.<ref name=\"Biskind\"/>\n\n==Soundtrack==\nThe soundtrack for ''Days of Heaven'' is a strong reflection of the film's context.

The film was a commercial failure: its box office gross of $3,446,749<ref>[https://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=daysofheaven.htm Box Office Mojo]</ref> was only slightly more than it cost to make the film ($3 million),  but Charles Bluhdorn who ran Paramount's parent company Gulf + Western, loved it so much he offered Malick $1 million for his next project, whatever it was.<ref>{{cite magazine|first=Blige|last=Ebiri|title=Thirty-Three Years of Principal Filming|magazine=[[New York (magazine)|New York]]|date=May 23, 2011|pages=84\u201385}}</ref> It was also in promoting contentions for Oscar nominations.<ref>[https://archive.org/details/WJZ-QUAD-04 Academy Awards Contenders: Teletronics-Internet Archive]</ref>\n\n===Contemporary response===\nCritical reaction initially varied. Many critics found the film visually beautiful, but others found its story weak. [[Dave Kehr]] of ''[[The Chicago Reader]]'' wrote: \"Terrence Malick's remarkably rich second feature is a story of human lives touched and passed over by the divine, told in a rush of stunning and precise imagery. Nestor Almendros's cinematography is as sharp and vivid as Malick's narration is elliptical and enigmatic.

This observation is true enough, if you think only about the actions of the adults in the story. But watching this 1978 film again recently, I was struck more than ever with the conviction that this is the story of a teenage girl, told by her, and its subject is the way that hope and cheer have been beaten down in her heart. We do not feel the full passion of the adults because it is not her passion: It is seen at a distance, as a phenomenon, like the weather, or the plague of grasshoppers that signals the beginning of the end.<ref>[https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/great-movie-days-of-heaven-1978 \"Days of Heaven\"].

Its first notable release was on home video in the early 1980s, followed by various reissues in the 1980s and 1990s. In particular, the film was released on a special [[widescreen]] edition format on home video to preserve the film's original theatrical [[aspect ratio (image)|aspect ratio]], which was uncommon for videotapes at the time, with majority of them being [[pan and scan]], a technique that crops a portion of the image to focus on the more important composition. This often results in the side being cut out and the middle center being the only remaining part. ''Days of Heaven'' premiered on DVD on March 30, 1999 with no special features. The feature itself was presented in widescreen and released by Paramount Pictures, the copyright owner of the film itself. It was re-released on DVD in 2004, again without special supplements.\n\nIn 2007, the [[Criterion Collection]] released an exclusive special edition of the film, with digitally remastered sound and picture, supervised by Malick, editor Billy Weber and camera operator John Bailey. Bonus features include an audio commentary by art director Jack Fisk, editor Billy Weber, costume designer Patricia Norris, and casting director Dianne Crittenden; an audio interview with Richard Gere; video interviews with Sam Shepard, Haskell Wexler, and John Bailey; and a booklet featuring an essay on the film by [[Adrian Martin]] and an extract from N\u00e9stor Almendros' autobiography.<ref>{{cite news\n  | title = DVD Review: Days of Heaven - The Criterion Collection\n  | work = [[Seattle Post Intelligencer]]\n  | date = March 28, 2010\n  | url = http://www.seattlepi.com/ae/movies/article/DVD-Review-Days-of-Heaven-Criterion-Collection-886862.php\n  | access-date = June 14, 2012\n  }}</ref> The Criterion Collection also released a [[Blu-ray]] format of the film on March 7, 2010, with the same special features.
