He meets Inspector Jean-Pierre Richard ([[Tch\u00e9ky Karyo]]), a corrupt and violent police detective, at a hotel. Richard tricks Liu into believing he is simply providing reconnaissance of a meet involving Mr. Big. During the operation, Mr. Big is introduced to two female prostitutes, one being Jessica Kamen ([[Bridget Fonda]]), an American woman, who he takes back to his room for sex. While Liu and the rest are watching through the surveillance camera, Mr. Big kicks everyone out except for the two women. After pretending to seduce him, the other prostitute stabs Mr. Big. Overseeing the events from another room, Liu rushes in and subdues the prostitute. He then attempts to call for help to save Mr. Big's life, but Richard enters shortly after, shooting Mr. Big and the woman with Liu's police-issued handgun, framing Liu for both murders. Jessica hides in the bathroom during the commotion.\n\nRealizing he has been set up, Liu manages to escape from the hotel with a surveillance tape showing Richard shooting Mr. Big. After the events, Chinese [[wikt:liaison|liaison]]s are sent to France to investigate the matter, as Richard makes Liu the primary suspect. However, the liaisons do not believe the story Richard provides. Liu meets with one of them on a ferry and passes him the tape, revealing the truth. However, Richard's men spot them, and the liaison is assassinated. Liu is then forced to flee from a horde of cops and [[GIGN]] commandos. After Liu escapes, he is forced to maintain a low profile.\n\nWhile his situation worsens, he meets Jessica, whose daughter was kidnapped by Richard to force her into prostitution. Liu discovers that Jessica was the second prostitute at the hotel during the night of Mr. Big's murder. He realizes she can prove his innocence, but she refuses to go without retrieving her daughter, Isabel (Isabelle Duhauvelle). Liu decides the tape would provide the best evidence, and sends Jessica to Richard's office to steal the tape. Jessica manages to get the tape, then Liu and Jessica head to an orphanage where Isabel is kept. However, Richard anticipates this move, and ambushes the duo at the orphanage. During their escape, Jessica is shot in the chest. Liu manages to get her to the hospital in time and leaves for the police station, driven to retrieve her daughter.\n\nLiu arrives at the police station where Richard is holding Isabel [[hostage]] and he fights his way through another horde of policemen. After managing to defeat Richard's personal [[henchmen]], Liu enters his office and finds him holding Isabel at gunpoint. Even though Liu is unarmed, he tells Richard that if he kills Isabel, then he will have all the time he needs to kill him. Richard tries to kill Liu, but he only manages to shoot him in the shoulder. However, the bullet injury fails to prevent Liu from disarming Richard while sticking an [[acupuncture]] needle into the back of his neck, in a forbidden location known as the \"kiss of the dragon,\" which stimulates all the body's blood to travel to the brain to cause a painful death by brain [[aneurysm]]. Richard suffers and dies from the \"kiss of the dragon\" just as Liu departs with Isabel. Returning to Jessica's hospital bedside, Liu removes an acupuncture needle from Jessica's neck, promptly waking her. Upon waking up, she happily finds Isabel peacefully sleeping by her side.\n\n==Origin of title==\nThe title \"Kiss of the Dragon\" is derived from one of the last scenes in the movie, in which Liu punctures Richard in the back of the neck with an acupuncture needle at a \"very forbidden\" point on the body. The puncture itself, called \"kiss of the dragon\", traps all the body's blood in the head and causes side effects of [[quadriplegia]], bleeding from the head's orifices, and a painful death by [[cerebral aneurysm|brain aneurysm]].\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Jet Li]] as Inspector Liu \"Johnny\" Jian \n* [[Bridget Fonda]] as Jessica Kamen\n* [[Tch\u00e9ky Karyo]] as Inspector Jean-Pierre Richard\n* [[Ric Young]] as \"Mr. Big\" Sung\n* [[Burt Kwouk]] as Uncle Tai\n* [[Max Ryan]] as Lupo\n* Kentaro as Chen\n* Laurence Ashley as Aja\n* [[Cyril Raffaelli]] as Twin\n* Didier Azoulay as Twin\n* [[John Forgeham]] as Inspector Max\n* Paul Barrett as Pilot\n* Colin Prince as Lupo's Assistant\n* Vincent Glo as \"Pluto\"\n* [[Vincent Wong (UK actor)|Vincent Wong]] as Minister Tang\n* Isabelle Duhauvelle as Isabel Kamen\n* [[Affif Ben Badra]] as Lupo's Henchman (uncredited)\n\n==Production==\nThe director filmed most of the action sequences without [[Computer generated imagery|CGI]] or [[wire fu|wire work]]; only two scenes required CGI enhancement and only one scene involved wire work.<ref name=\"dvdtown\">{{cite web |url= http://www.dvdtown.com/reviews/kiss-of-the-dragon/4097 |title= Blu-ray review of Kiss of the Dragon |access-date= 2008-07-02 |author= James Plath |publisher= DVDTown.com |url-status= dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20081204154909/http://www.dvdtown.com/reviews/kiss-of-the-dragon/4097 |archive-date= 2008-12-04 }}</ref> Wire work was added to one of the last fight sequences between Li and [[Cyril Raffaelli]], in order to add clarity to Raffaelli's kicks, as he was moving too fast for the camera.
