The film is written by [[Gordy Hoffman]], a playwright and the elder brother of Philip. ''Love Liza'' debuted at the [[Sundance Film Festival|2002 Sundance Film Festival]], where it won the [[List of Sundance Film Festival award winners|Waldo Salt Screenwriting Award]].\n\n==Plot==\n\nWilson Joel's wife Liza has, for an inexplicable reason, died by suicide. Wilson's one-night discovers a sealed letter from his wife, which he believes to be her suicide note. In his grief-stricken state and with the added stress of finding the letter, which he cannot bring himself to open and read, he forms an addiction to inhaling [[gasoline]] fumes (\"[[huffing]]\"). His mother-in-law Mary Ann tries her best to help her son and deal with her own loss at the same time. She becomes increasingly anxious to know the contents of the letter, but Wilson refuses to open it.\n\nTo hide his addiction from his coworker Maura, he informs her that the petrol smell in his house is from his hobby of flying remote-controlled planes. To try to engage an ever-distant Wilson, Maura asks her brother-in-law, Denny, a [[radio control]] (RC) hobbyist, to visit Wilson. Knowing Denny will soon visit him, Wilson heads to an RC hobbyist shop to buy a plane, and learns that model planes run on [[Glow fuel]] instead of gasoline.\n\nWhen Maura eventually confesses her attraction to Wilson, he runs away from her and begins a road trip to New Orleans. He grows more disoriented as he huffs on the trip, and stumbles upon an RC competition in [[Slidell, Louisiana]]. Wilson goes swimming in the lake, disrupting the RC boat races. Denny greets him on the shore with a towel, and explains to all the upset racers that Wilson just lost his wife to suicide.\n\nDenny drives Wilson back home. Along the way, he encourages Wilson to open Liza's letter, but he is horrified when Wilson wants to do it in front of him. Wilson's addiction grows out of control, and he loses a work opportunity when a client discovers him huffing glow fuel with neighborhood kids.\n\nAfter breaking into Mary Ann's house to get pictures of Liza, Wilson finds her alone holding Liza's letter. He returns home with the letter and finally opens it. His late wife's final wish is for Wilson to find someone else to love in life, while holding onto her in his heart. After he reads the final words of the letter, \"Love, Liza,\" Wilson strikes a match and burns the letter. The gas fumes in the house ignite his clothes. Wilson peels them off and throws them to the ground, only igniting more fumes on the carpet. In his underwear, he walks out of his burning house down the road in the middle of traffic.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n*[[Philip Seymour Hoffman]] as Wilson Joel\n*[[J.D. Walsh (actor)|J.D.

Still, it\u2019s doubtful that the film would register nearly so well without Philip Seymour Hoffman in the leading role.
