The film explores themes of race, sex, nationality, and sexuality against the backdrop of [[the Troubles]] in Northern Ireland.\n\nThe film follows Fergus (Rea), a member of the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army|IRA]], who has a brief but meaningful encounter with a British soldier, Jody (Whitaker), who is being held prisoner by the group. Fergus later develops an unexpected romantic relationship with Jody's lover, Dil (Davidson), whom Fergus promised Jody he would take care of. Fergus is forced to decide between what he wants and what his nature dictates he must do.\n\nA critical and commercial success, ''The Crying Game'' won the [[BAFTA Award for Best British Film]] as well as the [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay]], alongside [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] nominations for [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]], [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] for Rea, [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Supporting Actor]] for Davidson, and [[Academy Award for Best Film Editing|Best Film Editing]]. In 1999, the [[British Film Institute]] named it the [[BFI Top 100 British films|26th-greatest British film of all time]].\n\n== Plot ==\nAt a rural [[Northern Ireland|Northern Irish]] fairground, a [[Provisional Irish Republican Army|Provisional IRA]] volunteer named Fergus ([[Stephen Rea]]) and a unit of other IRA members, led by Peter Maguire ([[Adrian Dunbar]]), kidnap a [[black British]] soldier named Jody ([[Forest Whitaker]]) after a female member of their unit, Jude ([[Miranda Richardson]]), lures Jody to a secluded area by [[Honey trapping|promising sex]]. The unit intends to hold Jody until an imprisoned IRA member is released, and if their demands are not met within three days, he will be executed. Fergus\u2014assigned to stand guard over Jody\u2014begins bonding with him, and Jody tells Fergus the fable of [[the Scorpion and the Frog]].\n\nRealising he will most likely die, Jody requests Fergus to promise to seek out his girlfriend Dil ([[Jaye Davidson]]). When the deadline set by Jody's captors passes with their demands unmet, Fergus is ordered to take Jody into the woods to kill him. Fergus seemingly complies but when Jody attempts escape, Fergus pursues him without shooting him. Just as Jody escapes onto a road, a British [[Alvis Saracen APC|armoured personnel carrier]] accidentally runs over and kills him. The British army attacks the IRA unit and Fergus manages to escape, believing that his companions have perished in the attack. Fergus escapes to London, taking a job as a day labourer under the alias \"Jimmy\".\n\nA few months later, Fergus encounters Dil, working as a stylist at a hair salon. Later, they talk in a bar, where a drunken customer torments Dil. Fergus, consumed by guilt over Jody's death, follows the pair, rescuing Dil. Fergus soon begins falling in love with her and their relationship progresses, but when the two prepare to become intimate in her apartment, Dil reveals her [[transgender]] status while undressing. An initially repulsed Fergus rushes to the bathroom to vomit after hitting Dil in the face, and then leaves her apartment. A few days later, Fergus leaves Dil a note in her mailbox apologising and the two reconcile. Despite initially being shocked by Dil's gender identity, he is still taken by her. Around the same time, Jude unexpectedly reappears and tells Fergus the IRA has tried and convicted him of treason ''in absentia''. She forces him to agree to help assassinate a British judge, and mentions that she knows about his affair, warning him that the IRA will kill Dil if he does not cooperate.\n\nFergus continues to woo Dil, cutting her hair short and dressing her in Jody's old cricket uniform as a disguise to shield her from possible retribution. The night before the IRA mission, Dil gets drunk and Fergus escorts her to her apartment, where she asks him to never leave her again. Fergus stays with her, and admits his role in Jody's death. Dil, drunk, appears not to understand; however, in the morning, before Fergus awakens, Dil restrains him by tying his arms and legs to the bed with stockings, leaving Fergus unable to complete the assassination. Holding Fergus at gunpoint with his own pistol, Dil demands that he tell her that he loves her and will never leave her; he complies, and she unties him.\n\nWithout Fergus present, an angered Maguire decides with Jude to proceed with the mission. Maguire underestimates the judge's protection, and an armed bodyguard shoots and kills him while Jude manages to escape. She vengefully enters Dil's flat with a gun, seeking to kill Fergus for missing the assassination. Dil subdues her and shoots her repeatedly after uncovering her part in Jody's death, finally killing her with a shot to the neck. She then points the gun at Fergus, but lowers it, saying that she cannot kill him because Jody will not allow her to. Fergus prevents Dil from shooting herself and tells her to go into hiding. He wipes her fingerprints off the gun, replaces them with his own, and allows himself to be arrested in her place. A few months later, Dil visits Fergus in prison and asks why he took the fall for her. He responds, \"As a man once said, it's in my nature,\" and tells her the story of the Scorpion and the Frog.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Stephen Rea]] as Fergus\n* [[Miranda Richardson]] as Jude\n* [[Forest Whitaker]] as Jody\n* [[Jaye Davidson]] as Dil\n* [[Adrian Dunbar]] as Peter Maguire\n* [[Tony Slattery]] as Deveroux\n* [[Jim Broadbent]] as Col\n* [[Birdy Sweeney]] as Tommy\n* [[Ralph Brown]] as Dave\n* [[Andr\u00e9e Bernard]] as Jane\n* Joe Savino as Eddie\n* Breffni McKenna as Tinker\n* Jack Carr as Franknum\n{{div col end}}\n\n== Production ==\n[[Neil Jordan]] first drafted the screenplay in the mid-1980s under the title ''The Soldier's Wife'', but shelved the project after a similar film was released. \nA 1931 short story by [[Frank O'Connor]] called ''[[Guests of the Nation]]'', in which IRA soldiers develop a bond with their English captives, whom they are ultimately forced to kill,<ref name=\"conversation\">{{cite video |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HD2lhfB53Bs  |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211211/HD2lhfB53Bs| archive-date=2021-12-11 |url-status=live|title=In conversation with The Crying Game cast |author=British Film Institute |author-link=British Film Institute |publisher=YouTube |date=2017-02-21 |access-date=2018-05-23}}{{cbignore}}</ref> partly inspired the story.

Director Neil Jordan, in later interviews, attributed this failure to the film's heavily political undertone, particularly its sympathetic portrayal of an IRA fighter. The [[Sussex Arms pub bombing|bombing of a pub]] in London is specifically mentioned as turning the English press against the film.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0104036/?ref_=ttspec_spec_tt |title=The Crying Game |website=[[IMDb]] |date=19 February 1993 |access-date=2 March 2021}}</ref>\n\nThe then-fledgling film company [[Miramax Films]] decided to promote the film in the U.S. where it became a [[sleeper hit]].

The film has a 94%  rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on 67 reviews, with an average rating of 8.20/10. The consensus states, \"''The Crying Game'' is famous for its shocking twist, but this thoughtful, haunting mystery grips the viewer from start to finish.\"<ref>{{rotten-tomatoes|crying_game|The Crying Game}}</ref>\n\n[[Roger Ebert]] awarded the film a rating of four out of four stars, describing it in his review as one that \"involves us deeply in the story, and then it reveals that the story is really about something else altogether\" and named it \"one of the best films of 1992\".<ref>{{Cite web|last=Ebert|first=Roger|author-link=Roger Ebert|date=18 December 1992|title=The Crying Game|url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/the-crying-game-1992|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130603091126/http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/the-crying-game-1992|archive-date=3 June 2013|access-date=2 March 2021|website=[[RogerEbert.com]]}}</ref>\n\n[[Richard Corliss]], in ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine, stated: \"And the secret?
