The film centers on Moncho (Manuel Lozano) and his [[coming-of-age]] experience in [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]] in 1936. Moncho develops a close relationship with his teacher Don Gregorio ([[Fernando Fern\u00e1n G\u00f3mez]]), who introduces the boy to different things in the world. While the story centres on Moncho's ordinary coming-of-age experiences, tensions related to the looming [[Spanish Civil War]] periodically interrupt Moncho's personal growth and daily life.\n\nThe film is adapted from three short stories from the 1996 book ''{{lang|gl|Que me queres, amor?}}'' by Galician author [[Manuel Rivas]]. The short stories are \"A lingua das bolboretas\", \"Un saxo na n\u00e9boa\", and \"Carmi\u00f1a\".\n\nThe film received some critical acclaim. It was nominated for the 2000 [[Goya Award]] for Best Picture, and it won the Goya Award for Best Adapted Screenplay. ''Butterfly's Tongue'' also has a 96% rating on RottenTomatoes.com.<ref>[http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/la-lengua-de-las-mariposas-butterfly-butterfly-tongues/ Butterfly - Movie Reviews, Trailers, Pictures - Rotten Tomatoes<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Fernando Fern\u00e1n G\u00f3mez]] as Don Gregorio\n* {{illm|Manuel Lozano (actor)|lt=Manuel Lozano|es|3=Manuel Lozano}} as Moncho\n* Elena Fernandez as Carmi\u00f1a\n* {{illm|Uxia Blanco|es|Uxia Blanco}} as Rosa\n* {{illm|Gonzalo Mart\u00edn Uriarte|es|Gonzalo Mart\u00edn Uriarte}} as Ram\u00f3n\n* {{illm|Alexis de los Santos|es|Alexis de los Santos}} as Andr\u00e9s\n\n==Plot==\nIn a [[Galicia (Spain)|Galician]] town in the 1930s, a young boy, Moncho, goes to school for the first time and is taught by Don Gregorio about life and literature. At first, Moncho is afraid that the teachers will hit him, since that was the standard procedure, but he is relieved to discover that Don Gregorio does not hit his pupils. Don Gregorio is unlike the other teachers; he builds a special relationship with Moncho, teaching him to love learning. Don Gregorio teaches him about the butterfly\u2019s tongue on a field trip through the woods, with Moncho having an asthma attack and being assisted by Don Gregorio. Don Gregorio also builds a special relationship with Moncho's father, who is a Republican like him. At this period in Spain, the [[Republican faction (Spanish Civil War)|Republican]] and the [[Nationalist faction (Spanish Civil War)|Nationalist]] factions are fighting a civil war, forcing people to take sides. Moncho's mother is lukewarm towards the Republic, her main concern being belief in God; she eventually sides with the Nationalist rebels.\n\nWhen Nationalists take control of the town, they round up known Republicans, including Don Gregorio. As Moncho's father is a Republican, his family fears that he too will be arrested if the Nationalists discover his political leanings. In order to protect themselves, the family goes to the town square to jeer the captured Republicans as they are paraded out of the courthouse and put on a truck. The film ends with Moncho, despite his continued great affection for his friend and teacher, yelling hateful things and throwing rocks at Don Gregorio and the other Republicans, as instructed by his mother, as the truck carries them away, although the last thing Moncho yells are the words for the tongue of a butterfly, ''espiritrompa'' (Spanish for \"[[proboscis]]\"), a favorite word taught to him by Don Gregorio, in an attempt to let his dear friend know that he does not truly mean the words he is yelling.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{wikiquote-inline|Butterfly (1999 film)|''Butterfly'' (1999 film)}}\n* {{IMDb title|id=0188030|title=Butterfly}}\n* {{Mojo title|butterfly}}\n\n[[Category:1999 films]]\n[[Category:Spanish war drama films]]\n[[Category:1990s Spanish-language films]]\n[[Category:Films about anarchism]]\n[[Category:Spanish Civil War films]]\n[[Category:Films set in Galicia (Spain)]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by Rafael Azcona]]\n[[Category:1990s Spanish films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Jos\u00e9 Luis Cuerda]]"}]}}}}
