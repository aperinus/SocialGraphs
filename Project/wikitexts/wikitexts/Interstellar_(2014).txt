It stars [[Matthew McConaughey]], [[Anne Hathaway]], [[Jessica Chastain]], [[Bill Irwin]], [[Ellen Burstyn]], [[Matt Damon]], and [[Michael Caine]]. Set in a [[dystopia]]n future where humanity is struggling to survive, the film follows a group of [[astronaut]]s who travel through a [[wormhole]] near [[Saturn]] in search of a new home for mankind.\n\nBrothers Christopher and [[Jonathan Nolan]] wrote the screenplay, which had its origins in a script Jonathan developed in 2007. Christopher produced ''Interstellar'' with his wife, [[Emma Thomas]], through their production company [[Syncopy Inc.|Syncopy]], and with [[Lynda Obst]] through [[Lynda Obst Productions]]. [[Caltech]] theoretical physicist and 2017 [[Nobel Prize in Physics|Nobel laureate in Physics]]<ref name=\"NobelPrize\"/> [[Kip Thorne]] was an executive producer, acted as a scientific consultant, and wrote a tie-in book, ''[[The Science of Interstellar]]''. [[Paramount Pictures]], [[Warner Bros. Pictures]], and [[Legendary Pictures]] co-financed the film. Cinematographer [[Hoyte van Hoytema]] shot it on [[35 mm movie film]] in the [[Panavision]] [[anamorphic format]] and [[IMAX]] 70&nbsp;mm. Principal photography began in late 2013 and took place in [[Alberta]], [[Iceland]] and [[Los Angeles]]. ''Interstellar'' uses extensive practical and [[miniature effect]]s and the company [[Double Negative (VFX)|Double Negative]] created additional [[Visual effect|digital effects]].\n\n''Interstellar'' premiered on October 26, 2014, in Los Angeles, California. In the United States, it was first released on [[film stock]], expanding to venues using digital projectors. The film had a worldwide gross over <!--initial 2014 gross-->$677&nbsp;million (and $773&nbsp;million with subsequent re-releases), making it the [[2014 in film#Highest-grossing films|tenth-highest grossing film of 2014]]. It received acclaim for its performances, direction, screenplay, musical score, visual effects, ambition, themes, and emotional weight. It has also received praise from many astronomers for its scientific accuracy and portrayal of theoretical astrophysics. Since its premiere, ''Interstellar'' gained a cult following, and now is regarded by many sci-fi experts as one of the best science-fiction movies of all time. ''Interstellar'' was nominated for five awards at the [[87th Academy Awards]], winning [[Academy Award for Best Visual Effects|Best Visual Effects]], and received [[List of accolades received by Interstellar|numerous other accolades]].\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, the plot summary should be 400-700 words. -->\nIn 2067, ex-[[NASA]] pilot Cooper is forced to work as a farmer due to a global famine caused by [[blight]]. The famine is severe enough that it has had major effects on human society, including the abandonment of any scientific pursuit that is not directly related to solving the world's food problem. Government-run schools actively discourage students from studying subjects such as space exploration, claiming that historical events like the [[Apollo 11|moon landing]] were a political [[Moon landing conspiracy theories|hoax]] and that scientific organizations such as NASA were shut down due to a belief that it was a waste of money and resources. \n\nCooper ignores his daughter, Murph, when she claims a [[ghost]] is communicating to her through her bookshelf, but later finds dust particles forming an inexplicable pattern on Murph's bedroom floor. He investigates, and is led to a secret government facility where Professor Brand explains that NASA was not actually shut down, but rather has been secretly tasked by the government to explore the possibility of finding humanity a new home away from Earth. Blight, dust storms, and failing crops have rendered humans [[Human extinction|incapable of surviving]]. Brand claims to be working on a gravity equation to make this mission possible, and asks Cooper to pilot an exploratory spacecraft. Cooper agrees, promising a distraught Murph that he will return. He pilots a shuttle carrying scientists Romilly, Doyle, and Brand\u2019s daughter Amelia to dock with the spacecraft ''Endurance''. The ship is headed towards a [[wormhole]] that mysteriously appeared near [[Saturn]] decades ago.\n\nThe ''Endurance'' passes through the wormhole into another galaxy with a planetary system orbiting a [[supermassive black hole]] called Gargantua. The crew intends to investigate three planets, each previously explored by NASA volunteers, who shared positive reports for [[Planetary habitability|habitability]]. The first planet is an [[ocean world|aqua planet]] with massive tidal waves and no dry land. Doyle drowns after failing to get into the probe and getting knocked off by one of the waves, and Amelia and Cooper fly back to the ''Endurance'', only to find that decades have passed due to the [[gravitational time dilation|time slippage]] caused by the planet's proximity to Gargantua. Romilly, having remained onboard, has aged 23 years. Cooper replays messages from Earth, learning that Murph is now his age and has become a scientist working with Brand.\n\nThe crew journeys to the second planet to find the previous NASA explorer, Mann, is still alive and has established a base. On earth, Murph learns from a dying Professor Brand that he gave up on solving his gravity equation years ago, because it would take data from inside a black hole to reconcile, which is impossible to achieve. He reveals that he never intended for their mission to evacuate humanity from earth to succeed, and was instead planning for Cooper and his fellow astronauts to try to establish their own colony and hopefully restart the human race themselves. He dies, and a distraught Murph relays this information to the crew. As they explore the second planet, they discover that Mann falsified the data in his reports so that the NASA mission would come rescue him. Romilly is killed by Mann's booby trap when he tries to access the logs, and Mann attempts to hijack the ''Endurance'', but fails to dock properly, blowing out the hatch and killing himself in the process. Cooper and Amelia catch up with the damaged ''Endurance'' and dock safely.\n\nWith limited resources available to use their engines, Cooper proposes a [[Gravity assist|slingshot move]] around Gargantua, using its gravity to propel them toward the final planet. To shed mass, Cooper sacrifices himself at the last minute, dropping into the black hole and leaving Amelia to complete the journey. Falling past the [[event horizon]], Cooper finds himself inside a five-dimensional [[tesseract]]. He deduces that it was placed there by future humans with access to higher dimensions, as was the wormhole. He realizes that by using gravity, he is able to send messages to Murph and his past self. On Earth, Murph visits her childhood house after Professor Brand's death. She finds her father's old watch on her bookshelf, and notices the seconds-hand moving irregularly. She initially believes her \"ghost\" is back, only to realize that it was Cooper all along, sending her messages from a higher dimension. Cooper feeds Murph scientific data about the black hole's [[gravitational singularity|singularity]], which she eventually uses to solve the gravity equation, helping humanity escape [[Earth]].\n\nHis mission is now complete, and Cooper is ejected by future beings from the tesseract. He is sent back through the wormhole and picked up by a ranger orbiting Saturn. Due to the time slippage around Gargantua, almost 90 years have passed in Earth time since Cooper left, though he has barely aged. He awakens on a [[O'Neill cylinder|cylindrical space station]] and reunites with Murph, now a celebrated scientist who helped humans survive extinction. Nearing death, she advises Cooper not to wait around to see her die, and urges him to find Amelia, who may have settled on the other planet that could become their new home. Cooper steals a spacecraft and sets off on his new journey. On the other planet, Amelia is building a new colony for future humans to inhabit. She removes her helmet and breathes the air, showing that the planet is capable of supporting life.\n\n==Cast==\n{{multiple image\n| direction = horizontal\n| width1     = 128\n| width2     = 128\n| footer    = [[Matthew McConaughey]] and [[Anne Hathaway]] played the protagonists of ''Interstellar''.\n| image1    = Matthew McConaughey - Goldene Kamera 2014 - Berlin.jpg\n| alt1      = Matthew McConaughey\n| image2    = Anne Hathaway 2014 (cropped).jpg\n| alt2      = Anne Hathaway\n}}\n<!-- See the talk page before making changes to the listed cast. -->\n* [[Matthew McConaughey]] as Joseph Cooper,{{efn|Referred to only as \"Cooper\" or \"Coop\" in the film}} a widowed [[NASA]] pilot who, after the agency was closed by the government, had become a farmer\n* [[Anne Hathaway]] as Dr. Amelia Brand, a NASA scientist, and astronaut\n* [[Jessica Chastain]] as Murphy \"Murph\" Cooper, Joseph's daughter, who eventually becomes a NASA scientist\n** [[Mackenzie Foy]] as young Murph\n** [[Ellen Burstyn]] as elderly Murph\n* [[John Lithgow]] as Donald, Cooper's elderly father-in-law\n* [[Michael Caine]] as Professor John Brand, a high-ranking NASA scientist, ideator of Plan A, former mentor of Cooper, and father of Amelia\n* [[David Gyasi]] as Romilly, another high-ranking NASA member, and ''Endurance'' crew member\n* [[Wes Bentley]] as Doyle, a high-ranking NASA member, and ''Endurance'' crew member\n* [[Casey Affleck]] as Tom Cooper, Joseph's son, who eventually grows up to become a farmer\n** [[Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet]] as young Tom\n* [[Matt Damon]] as Mann, a NASA astronaut sent to an icy planet during the Lazarus program\n* [[Bill Irwin]] as TARS {{small|(voice and puppetry)}} and CASE {{small|(puppetry)}}\n* [[Josh Stewart]] as CASE {{small|(voice)}}\n* [[Topher Grace]] as Getty, Murph's colleague and love interest\n* [[Leah Cairns]] as Lois, Tom's wife\n* [[David Oyelowo]] as School Principal\n* [[Collette Wolfe]] as Ms. Hanley\n* [[William Devane]] as Williams, another NASA member\n* [[Elyes Gabel]] as Administrator\n* [[Jeff Hephner]] as Doctor\n* Russ Fega as Crew Chief\n\n==Production==\n===Crew===\n{{Div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Christopher Nolan]]&nbsp;\u2013 Director, producer, writer\n* [[Jonathan Nolan]]&nbsp;\u2013 Writer\n* [[Emma Thomas]]&nbsp;\u2013 Producer\n* [[Lynda Obst]]&nbsp;\u2013 Producer\n* [[Hoyte van Hoytema]]&nbsp;\u2013 Cinematographer\n* [[Nathan Crowley]]&nbsp;\u2013 Production designer\n* [[Mary Zophres]]&nbsp;\u2013 Costume designer\n* [[Lee Smith (film editor)|Lee Smith]]&nbsp;\u2013 Editor\n* [[Hans Zimmer]]&nbsp;\u2013 Music composer\n* [[Paul Franklin (visual effects supervisor)|Paul Franklin]]&nbsp;\u2013 Visual effects supervisor\n* [[Kip Thorne]]&nbsp;\u2013 Consultant, executive producer\n{{Div col end}}\n\n===Development and financing===\nThe premise for ''Interstellar'' was conceived by producer [[Lynda Obst]] and theoretical physicist [[Kip Thorne]], who collaborated on the film ''[[Contact (1997 American film)|Contact]]'' (1997), and had known each other since [[Carl Sagan]] set them up on a blind date.<ref name=\"jolin\"/><ref name=\"wired\"/> The two conceived a scenario, based on Thorne's work, about \"the most exotic events in the universe suddenly becoming accessible to humans,\" and attracted filmmaker [[Steven Spielberg]]'s interest in directing.<ref name=\"Fernandez-Mar2007\"/> The film began development in June 2006, when Spielberg and [[Paramount Pictures]] announced plans for a science-fiction film based on an eight-page treatment written by Obst and Thorne.

The ranger's function is similar to the [[Space Shuttle]]'s, being able to enter and exit planetary atmospheres. The ''Endurance'', the crew's [[mother ship]], is a circular structure consisting of 12 capsules, laid flat to mimic a clock: Four capsules with planetary settling equipment, four with engines, and four with the permanent functions of cockpit, medical labs, and habitation. Production designer Nathan Crowley said the ''Endurance'' was based on the [[International Space Station]]: \"It's a real mish-mash of different kinds of technology. You need analogue stuff, as well as digital stuff, you need backup systems and tangible switches. It's really like a submarine in space. Every inch of space is used, everything has a purpose.\" Lastly, the lander transports the capsules with settling equipment to planetary surfaces. Crowley compared it to \"a heavy Russian helicopter.\"<ref name=\"jolin\"/>\n\nThe film also features two robots, CASE and TARS, as well as a dismantled third robot, KIPP. Nolan wanted to avoid making the robots [[anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] and chose a {{Cvt|4.9|ft|order=flip}} [[quadrilateral]] design. The director said: \"It has a very complicated design philosophy. It's based on mathematics. You've got four main blocks and they can be joined in three ways. So, you have three combinations you follow. But then within that, it subdivides into a further three joints. And all the places we see lines\u2014those can subdivide further. So you can unfold a finger, essentially, but it's all proportional.\" Actor [[Bill Irwin]] voiced and physically controlled both robots, but his image was digitally removed from the film, and actor [[Josh Stewart]]'s voice replaced his voicing for CASE.<ref name=\"jolin\"/> The human space habitats resemble [[O'Neill cylinder]]s, a theoretical [[space habitat]] model proposed by physicist [[Gerard K. O'Neill]] in 1976.<ref name=\"GQ-Oct2014\"/>\n\n===Sound design and music===\n{{Main|Interstellar (soundtrack)}}\n[[Gregg Landaker]] and [[Gary Rizzo]] were the film's [[audio engineer]]s tasked with [[audio mixing]], while sound editor [[Richard King (sound designer)|Richard King]] supervised the process.<ref name=\"Desowitz-Sep2014\"/> Christopher Nolan sought to mix the sound to take maximum advantage of theater equipment<ref name=\"Hammond-Mar2014\"/> and paid close attention to designing the sound mix, like focusing on the sound of buttons being pressed with astronaut suit gloves.<ref name=\"jensen\"/> The studio's website stated that the film was \"mixed to maximize the power of the low-end frequencies in the main channels, as well as in the [[subwoofer]] channel.\"<ref name=\"InterstellarMovie\"/> Nolan deliberately intended some dialogue to seem drowned out by ambient noise or music, causing some theaters to post notices emphasizing that this effect was intentional and not a fault in their equipment.<ref name=\"McClintock-Nov2014\"/>\n\nComposer [[Hans Zimmer]], who scored [[The Dark Knight Trilogy|Nolan's ''The Dark Knight Trilogy'']] and ''[[Inception]]'' (2010), returned to score ''Interstellar''. Nolan chose not to provide Zimmer with a script or any plot details for writing the film's music but instead gave the composer a single page that told the story of a father leaving his child for work. It was through this connection that Zimmer created the early stages of the ''Interstellar'' soundtrack. Zimmer and Nolan later decided that the 1926 four-manual [[Harrison & Harrison]] organ of the [[Temple Church]], London, would be the primary instrument for the score.<ref name=\"Lubin-Nov2014\"/><ref name=\"Kilkenny\"/> Zimmer conducted 45 scoring sessions for ''Interstellar'', three times more than for ''Inception''. The soundtrack was released on November 18, 2014.<ref name=\"jensen\"/>\n\n===Visual effects===\nVisual effects company [[Double Negative (VFX)|Double Negative]], which worked on ''Inception'', was brought back for ''Interstellar''.<ref name=\"Giardina-Jun2014\"/> According to visual effects supervisor [[Paul Franklin (visual effects supervisor)|Paul Franklin]], the number of effects in the film was not much greater than in Nolan's ''[[The Dark Knight Rises]]'' (2012) or ''Inception''. However, for ''Interstellar'', they created the effects first, allowing digital projectors to display them behind the actors, rather than having the actors perform in front of [[Chroma key|green screens]].<ref name=\"jolin\"/> Ultimately, the film contained 850 visual-effect shots at a resolution of 5600 \u00d7 4000 lines: 150 shots that were created in-camera using digital projectors, and another 700 were created in post-production. Of those, 620 were presented in IMAX, while the rest were anamorphic.<ref name=\"VFXshots\"/>\n\nThe ranger, ''Endurance'', and lander spacecraft were created using [[miniature effect]]s by Nathan Crowley in collaboration with effects company New Deal Studios, as opposed to using computer-generated imagery, as Nolan felt they offered the best way to give the ships a tangible presence in space. [[3D printing|3D-printed]] and hand-sculpted, the scale models earned the nickname \"maxatures\" by the crew due to their immense size; the 1/15th-scale miniature of the ''Endurance'' module spanned over {{Cvt|7.6|m}}, while a [[pyrotechnic]] model of part of the craft was built at 1/5th scale. The Ranger and Lander miniatures spanned {{cvt|14|m}} and over {{cvt|15|m}}, respectively, and were large enough for van Hoytema to mount IMAX cameras directly onto the spacecraft, thus mimicking the look of NASA IMAX documentaries. The models were then attached to a six-axis [[gimbal]] on a motion control system that allowed an operator to manipulate their movements, which were filmed against background plates of space using [[VistaVision]] cameras on a smaller motion control rig.<ref name=\"EmanuelLevy-Oct2014\"/> New Deal Studio's miniatures were used in 150 special effects shots.<ref name=\"VFXshots\"/>\n\n==Influences==\nThe director was influenced by what he called \"key touchstones\" of science fiction cinema, including ''[[Metropolis (1927 film)|Metropolis]]'' (1927), ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]'' (1968), ''[[Blade Runner]]'' (1982),<ref name=\"EW-Apr2013\"/> ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'' (1977), and ''[[Alien (film)|Alien]]'' (1979).<ref name=\"Empire-Oct2014\"/> [[Andrei Tarkovsky]]'s ''[[The Mirror (1975 film)|The Mirror]]'' (1975) influenced \"elemental things in the story to do with wind and dust and water\", according to Nolan,<ref name=\"Mueller-Oct2014\"/> who also compared ''Interstellar'' to ''[[The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (film)|The Treasure of the Sierra Madre]]'' (1948) as a film about human nature.<ref name=\"Jensen-Oct2014\"/> He sought to emulate films like [[Steven Spielberg]]'s ''[[Jaws (film)|Jaws]]'' (1975) and ''[[Close Encounters of the Third Kind]]'' (1977) for being family-friendly but also \"as edgy and incisive and challenging as anything else on the blockbuster spectrum\". He screened ''[[The Right Stuff (film)|The Right Stuff]]'' (1983) for the crew before production,<ref name=\"jolin\"/> following in its example by capturing reflections on the ''Interstellar'' astronauts' visors. For further inspiration, the director invited former astronaut [[Marsha Ivins]] to the set.<ref name=\"galloway20141022\"/> Nolan and his crew studied the IMAX NASA documentaries of filmmaker [[Toni Myers]] for visual reference of spacefaring missions, and strove to imitate their use of IMAX cameras in the enclosed spaces of spacecraft interiors.<ref name=\"Space-Nov2014\"/> [[Clark Kent]]'s upbringing in ''[[Man of Steel (film)|Man of Steel]]'' (2013) was the inspiration for the farm setting in the Midwest.<ref name=\"marlow\"/> Apart from films, Nolan drew inspiration from the architecture of [[Ludwig Mies van der Rohe]].<ref name=\"galloway20141022\"/>\n\n==Scientific accuracy==\n[[File:Kip S.

Second, that all the wild speculations ... would spring from science and not from the fertile mind of a screenwriter.\" Nolan accepted these terms as long as they did not get in the way of making the film.<ref name=\"news.sciencemag.org\"/> At one point, Thorne spent two weeks trying to talk Nolan out of an idea about a character traveling faster than light before Nolan finally gave up.<ref name=\"NPR-Nov2014\"/> According to Thorne, the element which has the highest degree of artistic freedom is the clouds of ice on one of the planets they visit, which are structures that would go beyond the material strength that ice could support.<ref name=\"news.sciencemag.org\"/>\n\nAstrobiologist [[David Grinspoon]] criticized the dire \"blight\" situation on Earth portrayed in the early scenes, pointing out that even with a voracious blight it would have taken millions of years to reduce the atmosphere's oxygen content.

The visual representation of the black hole in the film does not account for the [[Doppler effect]] which, when added by the visual effects team, resulted in an asymmetrically lit black and blue-black hole, the purpose of which Nolan thought the audience would not understand. As a result, it was omitted in the finished product.<ref name=\"NewScientist-Feb2015\"/> Nolan found the finished effect to be understandable, as long as he maintained consistent camera perspectives.<ref name=\"WiredBlackHoleInterview\" />\n\nAs a reference, the asymmetric brightness of the accretion disk is very well visible in the first image<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Event Horizon Telescope Collaboration|last2=Akiyama|first2=Kazunori|last3=Alberdi|first3=Antxon|last4=Alef|first4=Walter|last5=Asada|first5=Keiichi|last6=Azulay|first6=Rebecca|last7=Baczko|first7=Anne-Kathrin|last8=Ball|first8=David|last9=Balokovic|first9=Mislav|last10=Barrett|first10=John|last11=Bintley|first11=Dan|date=2019-04-01|title=First M87 Event Horizon Telescope Results.

At times, the movie's one-stop-shopping storytelling evokes the tough-tender spirit of a [[John Ford]] picture, ... a movie that would rather try to be eight or nine things than just one.\"<ref name=\"Seitz-Nov2014\"/>\n\n''[[The New York Times]]'' columnist [[David Brooks (commentator)|David Brooks]] concludes that ''Interstellar'' explores the relationships among \"science and faith and science and the humanities\" and \"illustrates the real symbiosis between these realms.\"<ref name=\"Brooks-NYT\"/> [[Wai Chee Dimock]], in the ''[[Los Angeles Review of Books]]'', wrote that Nolan's films are \"rotatable at 90, 180, and 360 degrees,\" and that \"although there is considerable magical thinking here, making it almost an anti-sci-fi film, holding out hope that the end of the planet is not the end of everything, it reverses itself, however, when that magic falls short when the poetic license is naked and plain for all to see.\"<ref name=\"la review of books\"/> Author [[George R. R. Martin]] called ''Interstellar'' \"the most ambitious and challenging [[science fiction]] film since Kubrick's ''2001''.\"<ref name=\"RRMartin\"/> In 2020, ''[[Empire (film magazine)|Empire]]'' magazine ranked it as one of the best films of the 21st century.<ref name=\"Empire2020\"/>\n\n===Accolades===\n{{main|List of accolades received by Interstellar}}\nAt the [[87th Academy Awards]],
