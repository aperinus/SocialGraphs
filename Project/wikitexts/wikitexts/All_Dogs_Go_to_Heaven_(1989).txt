Barkin (voiced by [[Burt Reynolds]]), a German Shepherd that is murdered by his former friend, Carface Carruthers (voiced by [[Vic Tayback]], in his penultimate film role). Charlie withdraws from his place in Heaven to return to Earth where his best friend, Itchy Itchiford (voiced by [[Dom DeLuise]]), still lives, in order to take revenge on Carface. Instead, he ends up befriending a young orphan girl named Anne-Marie (voiced by [[Judith Barsi]] in her final film role; posthumously). In the process, Charlie learns an important lesson about kindness, friendship and love.\n\nThe film is an Irish, British and American venture, produced by [[Goldcrest Films]] and [[Sullivan Bluth Studios|Sullivan Bluth Studios Ireland Ltd]]. On its cinema release, it competed directly with [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Walt Disney Feature Animation]]'s ''[[The Little Mermaid (1989 film)|The Little Mermaid]]'', released on the same day. While it did not repeat the box-office success of Sullivan Bluth's previous feature films, ''[[An American Tail]]'' and ''[[The Land Before Time (film)|The Land Before Time]]'', it was successful on home video, becoming one of the biggest-selling [[VHS]] releases ever. It inspired a [[All Dogs Go to Heaven 2|theatrical sequel]], a [[All Dogs Go to Heaven: The Series|television series]], and a [[An All Dogs Christmas Carol|holiday direct-to-video film]].\n\n''All Dogs Go to Heaven'' was released on [[DVD]] on November 17, 1998, and as an [[MGM Kids]] edition on March 6, 2001. It had a DVD double-feature release with its sequel on March 14, 2006, and January 18, 2011. The film was released in high definition for the first time on Blu-ray on March 29, 2011, without special features except the original theatrical trailer.\n\n== Plot ==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 and 700 words! -->\nIn 1939 [[New Orleans]], slightly good-natured but generally scheming Charlie B. Barkin escapes from the [[Animal shelter|dog pound]] where he was to be [[Animal euthanasia|put down]] with the help of his best friend Itchy Itchiford and returns to their [[casino]] [[riverboat]] on the [[bayou]], formerly run by Charlie himself and his business partner, Carface Caruthers. Refusing to share the profits with Charlie, Carface had been responsible for Charlie getting committed to the pound and persuades Charlie to leave town with half of the casino's earnings. Charlie agrees, but is later [[Alcohol intoxication|intoxicated]] during [[Mardi Gras in New Orleans|Mardi Gras]] and killed by a car pushed downhill by Carface and his assistant, Killer. Charlie is sent to [[Heaven]] by default despite not having done any good deeds in his life; a [[whippet]] [[angel]] explains to him that because dogs are inherently good and loyal, all dogs go to Heaven and are entitled to paradise. Charlie cheats death by stealing a [[gold]] [[pocket watch]] representing his life and winding it back. As Charlie descends back to Earth, the whippet angel tells him that he can never return to Heaven; when the watch stops again, he will be sent to [[Hell]] instead. However, as long as the watch continues to run, Charlie will be immortal.\n\nAfter Charlie reunites with Itchy and plots revenge in the form of a rivaling business, they discover that Carface has kidnapped a young orphaned girl named Anne-Marie for her ability to talk to animals, which proves advantageous when betting on races. Charlie rescues her and promises to feed the [[Poverty|poor]] and help her find a family. The next day at the race track, Charlie steals a wallet from a couple as they talk to Anne-Marie and become alarmed by her ragged appearance. Charlie and Itchy use their winnings to build a successful casino in the junkyard where they live. Anne-Marie, upon realizing that she has been used, threatens to leave. To persuade her to stay, Charlie brings [[pizza]] to a family of poor puppies and their mother, Flo, at an abandoned church. While there, Anne-Marie becomes angry at Charlie for stealing the wallet. As Charlie has a nightmare in which he is condemned to Hell, Anne-Marie returns the wallet to the couple, Kate and Harold. While they privately discuss adopting her, Charlie arrives and tricks her into leaving with him. Charlie and Anne-Marie narrowly escape an ambush by Carface and Killer and hide in an abandoned building, but the ground breaks and they fall into the lair of King Gator, a giant effeminate [[alligator]]. He and Charlie bond over a love of music and he lets them go, but Anne-Marie contracts [[pneumonia]].\n\nCarface and his thugs destroy Charlie's casino and attack Itchy. An injured Itchy limps back to the church and confronts Charlie about his relationship with Anne-Marie, who Itchy thinks matters more than him. In his exasperation, Charlie loudly proclaims that he is using her and will eventually \"dump her in an orphanage\". A heartbroken Anne-Marie overhears the conversation and tearfully runs away before she is kidnapped by Carface. Charlie follows them to Carface's casino, where he is ambushed by Carface and his thugs. They fight with Charlie, inadvertently setting an oil fire that soon engulfs the whole structure. Charlie's pained howls from their bites summon King Gator, who chases down and devours Carface. In the chaos, both Anne-Marie and the watch fall into the water. Unable to rescue both at the same time, Charlie rescues Anne-Marie and places her onto some driftwood and pushes her toward safety; however, the watch stops before he can reach it, ending his life, so Killer finishes pushing her to shore, where Kate and Harold are waiting with [[New Orleans Police Department|police]] and [[Emergency medical services|medical personnel]]. Sometime later, Kate and Harold adopt Anne-Marie, who has also adopted Itchy. Charlie, having sacrificed himself to save Anne-Marie, has earned back his place in Heaven, and is allowed to return in [[ghost]] form to reconcile with Anne-Marie. Leaving Itchy in her care, Charlie returns to Heaven, where Carface finally arrives and takes his own clock, vowing revenge against King Gator. As the whippet angel chases him and warns against using it, Charlie assures the audience that \"he'll be back\" before winking and retrieving his halo.\n\n== Voice cast ==\n* [[Burt Reynolds]] as Charlie B. Barkin, a brash [[German Shepherd]] and a former [[Confidence trick|con artist]]. The character was designed specifically with Reynolds in mind for the role and the animators mimicked some of his mannerisms.\n** Reynolds is succeeded by [[Charlie Sheen]] for ''[[All Dogs Go to Heaven 2]]'', and [[Steven Weber (actor)|Steven Weber]] for ''[[All Dogs Go to Heaven: The Series]]'' and ''[[An All Dogs Christmas Carol]]''. The model for the character of Charlie was a German Shepherd, appropriately named Burt. Burt the dog often spent time with the animators at the studio, even going with them during the studio's move to [[Ireland]].\n* [[Dom DeLuise]] as Itchy Itchiford, a [[Paranoia|paranoid]], [[Anxiety|anxious]] but loyal [[Dachshund]].\n** DeLuise reprised his role in ''All Dogs Go to Heaven 2'', the series and ''An All Dogs Christmas Carol''.\n* [[Judith Barsi]] as Anne-Marie, a 7-year-old orphan girl with the [[Animal language|ability to talk to and understand animals]]. Her singing voice was performed by Lana Beeson. This was Barsi's final film role before her murder in 1988. The ending credits song \"Love Survives\" was dedicated in her memory as her character became absent in the further franchise.\n* [[Vic Tayback]] as Carface Caruthers, a violent, [[Sadistic personality disorder|sadistic]] mixed blue-nosed [[American Pit Bull Terrier]]/[[Bulldog]] gangster. This was Tayback's final film role before his death in 1990.\n** For ''All Dogs Go to Heaven 2'', ''All Dogs Go to Heaven: The Series'' and ''An All Dogs Christmas Carol'', [[Ernest Borgnine]] took Tayback's role.\n* [[Charles Nelson Reilly]] as Killer, a misnamed, fidgety, [[Neurosis|neurotic]] and spectacles-wearing [[Schnoodle]] who is Carface's [[comic relief]] sidekick.\n** Reilly was the second original voice actor that reprised his role in the series and ''An All Dogs Christmas Carol'' except for the sequel.\n* [[Loni Anderson]] as Flo, a female [[Rough Collie]] and Charlie's friend.\n* [[Melba Moore]] as a [[Whippet]] angel who welcomes deceased dogs into Heaven. She was named \"Annabelle\" in the 1996 sequel and its subsequent syndicated television series.\n** [[Bebe Neuwirth]] succeeded Melba in this role.  \n* [[Ken Page]] as King Gator, an [[American alligator]] and [[New Orleans voodoo|voodoo]] [[witch doctor]] living below the streets of [[New Orleans]].\n* Rob Fuller and Earleen Carey as Kate and Harold, a married couple who later become Anne-Marie's adoptive parents.\n* [[Godfrey Quigley]] as [[Terrier]], a dog that appears when Itchy tells everyone Anne-Marie is in danger.\n* [[Anna Manahan]] as Stella Dallas, a horse that appears when Anne-Marie, Charlie, and Itchy are at the derby. She is against the Once Upon a Wintertime Team. \n* [[Candy Devine]] as Vera, a female gambling dog.\n\n== Production ==\nThe earliest idea for the film was conceived by Don Bluth after finishing work on ''[[The Secret of NIMH]]''. The [[film treatment|treatment]] was originally about a canine [[private investigator|private eye]], and one of three short stories making up an [[anthology film]]. The character of a shaggy German Shepherd was designed specifically for Burt Reynolds. However, Bluth's first studio, [[Don Bluth Productions]], was going through a period of financial difficulty, ultimately having to declare bankruptcy, and the idea never made it beyond rough storyboards. The concept was revived by Bluth, [[John Pomeroy]] and [[Gary Goldman]], and rewritten by [[David N. Weiss]], collaborating with the producers from October through December 1987. They built around the title ''All Dogs Go to Heaven'' and drew inspiration from films, such as ''[[It's a Wonderful Life]]'', ''[[Little Miss Marker]]'' and ''[[A Guy Named Joe]]''. The film's title came from a book read to Bluth's fourth-grade class, and he resisted suggestions to change it, stating he liked how \"provocative\" it sounded, and how people reacted to the title alone.\n\nDuring the production of their previous feature film, Sullivan Bluth Studios had moved from [[Van Nuys, California]], to a state-of-the-art studio facility in [[Dublin]], Ireland, and the film was their first to begin production wholly at the Irish studio. It was also their first to be funded from sources outside of Hollywood, the previous two feature films, ''An American Tail'' and ''The Land Before Time'', had been backed by [[Amblin Entertainment]] and [[Universal Pictures]], and executive producers [[Steven Spielberg]] and [[George Lucas]] (for ''The Land Before Time'' only) exercised a degree of control over the content of the films, a situation Bluth found disagreeable.<ref name=\"cawley_tail\">{{cite web |author=Cawley, John |url=http://www.cataroo.com/DBtail.html |title=Don Bluth American Tail |publisher=The Animated Films of Don Bluth |access-date=October 20, 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"cawley_land\">Cawley, ''[http://www.cataroo.com/DBland.html The Land Before Time]''</ref> The studio found investment from UK-based Goldcrest Films in a US$70m deal to produce three animated feature films (though only two, ''[[Rock-a-Doodle]]'' and it, were completed under the deal).<ref name=\"cawley_ireland\">Cawley, ''[http://www.cataroo.com/DBireland.html At Home in Ireland]''</ref> The three founding members of the studio, Bluth, Pomeroy, and Goldman, had all moved to Ireland to set up the new facility, but during the film's production, John Pomeroy returned to the U.S. to head up a satellite studio which provided some of the animation for the film. Pomeroy also used his presence in the U.S. to generate early publicity for the film, including a presentation at the 1987 [[San Diego Comic-Con]].<ref name=\"cawley_dogs\">{{cite web |author=Cawley, John |url=http://www.cataroo.com/DBdogs.html |title=Don Bluth All Dogs Heaven |access-date=October 20, 2015 |publisher=The Animated Films of Don Bluth |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140103084802/http://www.cataroo.com/DBdogs.html |archive-date=2014-01-03 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nThe film's lead voices, Burt Reynolds and Dom DeLuise, had previously appeared together in five films. For this one, they requested them to record their parts in the studio together (in American animation, actors more commonly record their parts solo). Bluth agreed and allowed Reynolds and DeLuise to [[ad-lib]] extensively; Bluth later commented, \"their ad-libs were often better than the original script\".<ref name=\"beck\">*{{cite book|last=Beck|first=Jerry|title=The Animated Movie Guide|url=https://archive.org/details/animatedmoviegui0000beck|url-access=registration|date=October 2005|publisher=Chicago Review Press |isbn=1-55652-591-5|pages=[https://archive.org/details/animatedmoviegui0000beck/page/13 13\u201314]}} p.14</ref> However, Reynolds was more complimentary of the draft, warmly quipping, \"Great script, kid\", as he left the studio. Another pair of voices, those of Carface and Killer (Vic Tayback and Charles Nelson Reilly, respectively), also recorded together. Loni Anderson, who voices Flo, was Reynolds' then-wife.<ref name=\"cawley_dogs\" /> Child actress Judith Barsi, who voiced [[List of The Land Before Time characters#Ducky|Ducky]] in Bluth's previous film ''The Land Before Time'', was selected to voice Anne-Marie; she was killed in an apparent murder-suicide over a year before ''All Dogs Go to Heaven'' was released.<ref name=\"cawley_dogs\" />\n\nAs production neared completion, the studio held test screenings and decided that some of the scenes were too intense for younger viewers. Writer and producer Pomeroy decided to shorten Charlie's nightmare about being [[Damnation|condemned]]. Co-director Gary Goldman also agreed to the cut, recognizing that the concession needed to be made in the name of commercial appeal. Don Bluth owned a private 35-mm print of the movie with the cut-out scenes and planned to convince Goldcrest Films on releasing a director's cut of the film after returning from Ireland in the mid-1990s, but the print was eventually stolen from Bluth's locked storage room, diminishing hopes of this version being released on home media.<ref name=\"Ask Us Questions at donbluth.com\">Ask Us Questions at [donbluth.com]</ref>\n\n== Music ==\n{{Infobox album\n| name       = All Dogs Go to Heaven Original Motion Picture Soundtrack\n| type       = soundtrack\n| artist     = Various Artists\n| cover      =\n| alt        =\n| released   = July 1, 1989<ref name=Amazon>{{cite web |url=https://www.amazon.com/All-Dogs-Heaven-Various-artists/dp/B00R4PB5E4 |title=All Dogs Go To Heaven: Various artists |website=Amazon |access-date=October 20, 2015}}</ref>\n| recorded   =\n| venue      =\n| studio     =\n| genre      = Soundtrack\n| length     = 33:18\n| label      = [[Curb Records]]\n| producer   = [[Ralph Burns]]\n| prev_title =\n| prev_year  =\n| next_title =\n| next_year  =\n| misc       = {{Extra chronology\n | artist     = Don Bluth Music of Films\n | type       = soundtrack\n | prev_title = [[The Land Before Time (film)|The Land Before Time]]\n | prev_year  = 1988\n | title      = All Dogs Go to Heaven\n | year       = 1989\n | next_title = [[Rock-a-Doodle]]\n | next_year  = 1992\n}}\n}}\nThe music for ''All Dogs Go to Heaven'' was composed by [[Ralph Burns]] with lyrics by [[Charles Strouse]], T.J.

This was similar to the arrangement with United Artists when they distributed Bluth's first feature film, ''The Secret of NIMH''. Goldcrest Films invested $15 million in printing and promoting the film.

A theatrical sequel, ''[[All Dogs Go to Heaven 2]]'' (1996), a television series, ''[[All Dogs Go to Heaven: The Series]]'' (1996-1998), and ''[[An All Dogs Christmas Carol]]'' (1998), a Christmas television movie based on Charles Dickens' ''[[A Christmas Carol]]'', were made. Don Bluth and his studio had no involvement with any of them, and Burt Reynolds did not reprise his role as Charlie after the first film; he was replaced in the sequel film and television series by [[Charlie Sheen]] and [[Steven Weber (actor)|Steven Weber]], respectively. Charles Nelson Reilly declined to return for the sequel film, but voiced Killer for the television productions.
