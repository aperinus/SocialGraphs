It is based on the [[Little Children (novel)|2004 novel of the same name]] by [[Tom Perrotta]], who co-wrote the screenplay with Field.

Despite this, the film won numerous critics' group prizes and received three Oscar nominations: [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]] for Winslet, [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Supporting Actor]] for Haley, and [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Adapted Screenplay]] for Field and Perrotta.\n\n==Plot==\nSarah Pierce lives with her husband Richard and daughter Lucy. Their marriage falls apart, however, when she discovers his addiction to internet pornography. One day, she meets Brad Adamson, a law student who brings his 4-year-old son, Aaron, to the park. Brad and Sarah become friendly and, on a dare, kiss in the park. They are instantly attracted to each other, but resolve to keep their relationship platonic.\n\nOne day, several parents panic when they see [[sex offender]] Ronnie J. McGorvey, who was recently released from prison, swimming in the pool with the children. After he is escorted away by the police, Sarah and Brad take Lucy and Aaron back to her house and put the kids to bed. While Sarah is drying towels in her basement, Brad comes down and they have sex.\n\nRonnie lives with his mother, May, who believes that meeting a woman his own age would cure him of his [[pedophilia]]. Ronnie, reluctantly, agrees to go on a date May has arranged for him with a woman named Sheila, which ends badly when he masturbates next to her in the car by a children's playground.\n\nWhen Brad skips taking the bar exam again, his wife Kathy grows suspicious and tells Brad to invite Sarah, Richard, and Lucy over for dinner. The intimacy evident between Brad and Sarah confirms her suspicions, and Kathy arranges for her mother to come for an extended visit. When Brad's football team plays its final game, Sarah attends and cheers as Brad scores the winning touchdown. Afterwards, they make out on the field, with Brad convincing her to run away with him.\n\nLarry Hedges, Brad's friend and a former police officer, spends much of his time harassing Ronnie. One night, he enters Ronnie's neighborhood with a megaphone. May comes out to confront him, suffering a heart attack in the process when Larry pushes her to the ground, causing him to be arrested. May is taken to a hospital, where she dies. When Ronnie returns home from the hospital, he finds a letter written by May saying: \"Please be a good boy.\" Distraught, Ronnie destroys much of his mother's collection of [[Hummel figurines]] before grabbing a knife.\n\nThat same night, Sarah and Brad agree to meet in the park. As he heads to the park, he is distracted by skateboarding teenagers. Attempting to try a jump himself, he knocks himself out. When he regains consciousness, he asks the paramedics to call his wife to meet him at the hospital.\n\nWhen Sarah takes Lucy to the park, she sees Ronnie stagger onto one of the swings, revealing to her that his mother died. When Lucy disappears, Sarah panics and rushes to find her, forgetting about Brad. She finds her staring at a street lamp and places her back into her car. Larry arrives to apologize to Ronnie about May, but when he discovers that Ronnie has castrated himself and is bleeding to death, he races him to the hospital, the same time as Kathy meets Brad there.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|* [[Kate Winslet]] as Sarah Pierce\n* [[Patrick Wilson (American actor)|Patrick Wilson]] as Brad Adamson\n* [[Jennifer Connelly]] as Kathy Adamson\n* [[Jackie Earle Haley]] as Ronald James \"Ronnie\" McGorvey\n* [[Noah Emmerich]] as Larry Hedges\n* [[Phyllis Somerville]] as May McGorvey\n* [[Gregg Edelman]] as Richard Pierce\n* [[Ty Simpkins]] as Aaron Adamson\n* Sadie Goldstein as Lucy Pierce\n* [[Jane Adams (actress, born 1965)|Jane Adams]] as Sheila\n* [[Raymond J.
