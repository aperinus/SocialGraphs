Produced by [[Full Moon Entertainment]] and was shot in Romania, it is a [[sequel]] to the 1994 film ''[[Oblivion (1994 film)|Oblivion]]''.\n\nThe first film's cast (Richard Joseph Paul, [[Andrew Divoff]], [[George Takei]], [[Julie Newmar]], [[Isaac Hayes]], [[Musetta Vander]] and [[Meg Foster]]) reprise their roles, with [[Maxwell Caulfield]] as a new antagonist.\n\n==Synopsis==\nThe film begins shortly after the events of the first film. The setting is the alien-western world of Oblivion.\n\nA suave, yet lethal bounty hunter named Sweeney arrives to arrest the seductive outlaw Lash on multiple charges, including murder. Sweeney is the deadliest bounty hunter in the universe, and despite appearing as an English [[dandy]], is something far more sinister.\n\nLash, who just \"inherited\" a mine of Derconium (the most valuable mineral in the universe) from Crowley in a game of cards, meets up with Redeye's brother, Jaggar.\n\nSherriff Zack had killed Redeye in a duel in the previous film. Jaggar wants the mine for himself and use its ore to rule the galaxy.\n\nMiss Kitty, owner of the local bar/cathouse reveals to Zack that she is a wanted woman.\n\nA fight develops over Lash between the sheriff of Oblivion (Zack), Jaggar and Sweeney. In the resulting battle, Miss Kitty is apparently killed. With Jaggar defeated, Sweeney departs.\n\nMiss Kitty, alive, makes an appearance at her own funeral.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* Richard Joseph Paul as Zack Stone\n* [[Andrew Divoff]] as Jaggar / Einstein\n* [[George Takei]] as Doc Valentine\n* [[Julie Newmar]] as Miss Kitty\n* [[Isaac Hayes]] as Buster\n* [[Musetta Vander]] as Lash\n* [[Meg Foster]] as Stell Barr\n* [[Maxwell Caulfield]] as Sweeney\n* [[Jackie Swanson]] as Mattie Chase\n* [[Carel Struycken]] as Mr. Gaunt\n* [[Jimmie F.
