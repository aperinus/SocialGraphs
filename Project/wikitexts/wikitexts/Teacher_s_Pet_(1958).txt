He turns down the invitation via a nasty letter to her. His managing editor, however, orders him to accept the assignment. He arrives late to find Stone reading aloud his letter and mocking him in front of her class.\n\nHumiliated, he decides to join the class as a student in order to show up Stone and poses as a [[wallpaper]] salesman. The instructor is somewhat intrigued by this charming older man, whom she finds an exceptional student. Gannon continues his ruse and becomes attracted to Stone. He finds he has to contend with Dr. Pine, as well as his own girlfriend, Peggy DeFore, a [[nightclub singer]]. When Stone discovers Gannon's deception, she immediately calls off their relationship. Dr. Pine convinces her to give Gannon another chance.\n\nIn the end, Jim and Erica have come to understand, and partially adopt, the other's point of view.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Clark Gable]] as James Gannon &ndash; city editor for a large metropolitan newspaper, with no education past the 8th grade, who is convinced that formal education is \"a waste of time\" for anyone who would like to get into the newspaper business and that experience in the workplace is the key to success\n*[[Doris Day]] as Erica Stone &ndash; journalism instructor at a local university with whom Gannon falls in love\n*[[Gig Young]] as Dr. Hugo Pine &ndash; a worldly and attractive psychologist who has \"more degrees than a thermometer\", and Gannon's (perceived) rival for Stone's affections\n*[[Mamie Van Doren]] as Peggy DeFore &ndash; nightclub singer and Gannon's girlfriend\n*[[Nick Adams (actor, born 1931)|Nick Adams]] as Barney Kovac &ndash; copy boy at Gannon's paper who idolizes him.\n*[[Peter Baldwin (director)|Peter Baldwin]] as Harold Miller, cub reporter\n*[[Marion Ross]] as Katy Fuller, Stone's secretary\n*[[Charles Lane (actor)|Charles Lane]] as Roy, assistant city editor\n*[[Army Archerd]] as Himself\n\n==Release==\nThe film opened in the United States on March 19, 1958 and finished fifth at the US box office in its opening week.<ref name=AFI/><ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=Variety|title=National Boxoffice Survey|date=March 26, 1958|page=3|url=https://archive.org/stream/variety210-1958-03/page/n257/mode/2up|access-date=October 7, 2021|via=Archive.org}}</ref>\n\n==Awards and nominations==\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n!
