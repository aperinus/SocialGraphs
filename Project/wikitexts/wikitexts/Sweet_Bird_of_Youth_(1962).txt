Based on [[Sweet Bird of Youth|the 1959 play of the same name]] by [[Tennessee Williams]], it focuses on the relationship between a [[drifter (person)|drifter]] and a faded movie star. The film was adapted and directed by [[Richard Brooks]].<ref name=\"Variety\"/><ref name=\"Harrison\"/><ref name=\"auto\">{{OCLC|317647354}}</ref>\n\nThe film won the [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Actor in a Supporting Role]] (Ed Begley), and was nominated for [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress in a Leading Role]] (Geraldine Page) and [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Actress in a Supporting Role]] (Shirley Knight). The film version was sanitized, with Chance becoming a drifter rather than a gigolo for hire. The ending was also heavily altered from the explicit sexual mutilation scene depicted in the conclusion of the original stage version.\n\n==Plot==\nHandsome, young Chance Wayne returns to his hometown of St. Cloud, Mississippi accompanied by a considerably older film star, Alexandra Del Lago. She is needy and depressed, particularly about a film she has just finished making, and speaks of retiring from the acting world forever.\n\nChance had gone to Hollywood to seek fame and fortune at the behest of St. Cloud's most powerful and influential citizen, \"Boss\" Finley, either too naive or unwilling to appreciate that Finley merely wants Chance, a waiter from the country club, to keep away from his beautiful daughter, Heavenly.\n\nA political kingpin, Finley enjoys putting Heavenly on display as a model of purity and chastity. His ruthless son, Tom Jr., aids his father's ambitions in any way he can. He, too, is unhappy to have Chance Wayne back in town.\n\nDesperate to have Alexandra further his fantasy of becoming a star, Chance has become her lover. He goes so far as to blackmail her with a tape recording, on which she speaks openly of a dependence on drugs. Alexandra defies him, becoming irate at the realization that Chance's romantic interests in Heavenly are more important to him than her own needs.\n\nJust when Alexandra is at her most vulnerable, a call comes from Hollywood to notify her that the new movie she's just made appears to be a certain success, reviving her career. Meanwhile, Finley's discarded mistress, Miss Lucy, exposes Finley's underhanded tactics to the government authorities. Chance, with nowhere else to turn and still on his own two feet, persuades Heavenly to leave town with him.<ref>TCM film review of Sweet Bird of Youth.

Since the screen version couldn't be as explicit, director/screenwriter Richard Brooks completely re-wrote the ending and came up with a conclusion that is practically upbeat in comparison to the original fadeout.\") -->Able now to face the truth about himself, Chance and Heavenly reconcile and leave town together, leaving her father to face indictment.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=25em}}\n* [[Paul Newman]] as Chance Wayne\n* [[Geraldine Page]] as Alexandra Del Lago\n* [[Shirley Knight]] as Heavenly Finley\n* [[Ed Begley]] as Tom Boss Finley\n* [[Rip Torn]] as Thomas \"Tom\" J.
