The film stars [[Kirk Douglas]] as a cynical, disgraced reporter who stops at nothing to try to regain a job on a major newspaper. The film co-stars [[Jan Sterling]] and features [[Robert Arthur (actor)|Robert Arthur]] and [[Porter Hall]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Film Noir: The Encyclopedia |first=Alain |last=Silver |year= 2010 |isbn= 978-0715638804 |page= 24}}</ref>\n\nIt marked a series of firsts for [[Auteur theory|auteur]] [[Billy Wilder]]: it was the first time he was involved in a project as a writer, producer, and director; his first film following his breakup with long-time writing partner [[Charles Brackett]], with whom he had collaborated on ''[[The Lost Weekend (film)|The Lost Weekend]]'' and ''[[Sunset Boulevard (film)|Sunset Boulevard]]'', among others; and his first film to be a critical and commercial failure.{{sfn|Sikov|1998|p=325-38}}\n\nThe story is a biting examination of the seedy relationship between the press, the news it reports and the manner in which it reports it. The film also shows how a gullible public can be manipulated by the press. Without consulting Wilder, [[Paramount Pictures]] executive [[Y. Frank Freeman]] changed the title to ''The Big Carnival'' just prior to its release.<ref name=tcmnotes>[http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/613826/Ace-in-the-Hole/notes.html \"Notes\"] [[TCM.com]]</ref> Early television broadcasts retained that title, but when aired by [[Turner Classic Movies]] &ndash; and when released on [[DVD]] by [[The Criterion Collection]] in July 2007 &ndash; it reverted to ''Ace in the Hole''.\n\nIn 2017, the film was selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".<ref>{{cite web|author=Staff|url=https://www.loc.gov/item/prn-17-178/|access-date=December 13, 2017|title=2017 National Film Registry Is More Than a 'Field of Dreams'|date=December 13, 2017|website=[[Library of Congress]] [[National Film Registry]]}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n{{Long plot|date=June 2021}}\nChuck Tatum is a newly sober reporter whose washed-up career in NYC leads him to head West, out of money and options. Tatum stops at the ''Albuquerque Sun-Bulletin'' and offers himself to the publisher, Boot, as a \"$250-a-week newspaperman\" he can have for $50. Skeptical, Boot hires Tatum. \n\nTatum stays sober for a year. On assignment with the newspaper's young [[photography|photographer]], Herbie Cook , they learn about Leo Minosa, a local man trapped in a collapsed [[cliff dwelling]]. \n\nTatum and Cook get close enough to talk to Leo to pass him food and drink. Cook photographs him as Tatum tries to cheer him up.\n\nTatum senses an opportunity to manipulate the rescue effort for publicity. After filing an initial report on the accident, he persuades local [[sheriff]], Kretzer, to give him exclusive access to Leo in return for reportage that will guarantee Kretzer's reelection. \n\nConstruction contractor, Smollett, says it will take 12&ndash;16 hours to shore up the existing passages and get Minosa out, but Tatum and Kretzer convince him to drill from above, which will take a week and keep Tatum on newspaper front pages nationwide.\n\nLorraine Minosa, Leo's wife, is eager to leave Leo and their struggling restaurant, but as tourists flock to the rescue site, the financial windfall leads her to go along with Tatum's scheme. \n\nCook loses his idealism as he dreams of selling pictures to ''[[Look (American magazine)|Look]]'' or ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]''. Tatum and Cook quit the ''Sun-Bulletin'' and Tatum talks a New York editor into hiring him to report exclusively from the scene for $1,000 a day and his old job back.\n\nAs the days pass, the rescue site becomes an all-day carnival with rides, games, and songs about Leo. Tatum starts drinking again and hooks up with Lorraine. \n\nFive days into the event, Leo develops pneumonia and is given 12 hours to live. Tatum sends a news flash: Leo will be rescued win 12 hours, but when he tells Smollett to stop drilling and shore up the walls, he learns that the vibration from drilling makes this impossible. \n\nTatum fights with Lorraine and she stabs him with a pair of scissors. Mortally injured, Tatum takes the local priest to Leo to administer the Last Rites and Tatum orders the crew to stop drilling. He tells he crowd that Leo died and to pack up and leave. As the carnival and crowd pack up and move out en masse, Lorraine among them.\n\nFired by his New York editor, and slowly dying from the stab wound, Tatum calls him and tries to confess to killing Leo by delaying the rescue, but the editor hangs up on him without hearing his confession.\n\n==Cast==\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Kirk Douglas]] as Chuck Tatum\n* [[Jan Sterling]] as Lorraine Minosa\n* [[Robert Arthur (actor)|Robert Arthur]] as Herbie Cook\n* [[Porter Hall]] as Jacob Q.

The first involved [[Floyd Collins|W. Floyd Collins]], who in 1925 was trapped inside [[Sand Cave, Kentucky]], following a landslide. A [[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville]] newspaper, the ''[[Courier-Journal]]'', jumped on the story by dispatching reporter [[William Burke Miller]] to the scene. Miller's enterprising coverage turned the tragic episode into a national event and earned the writer a [[Pulitzer Prize]]. Collins's name is cited in the film as an example of a cave-in victim who becomes a media sensation. The second event took place in April 1949. Three-year-old [[Kathy Fiscus]] of [[San Marino, California]], fell into an abandoned well and, during a rescue operation that lasted several days, thousands of people arrived to watch the action unfold. In both cases, the victims died before they were rescued.{{sfn|Sikov|1998|p=312-13}}\n\nAfter the film's release screenwriter Victor Desny sued Wilder for [[plagiarism]] because he had contacted Wilder's secretary Rosella Stewart to propose a film based on the story of Floyd Collins in November 1949. Wilder's attorneys responded that not only did an oral plot summary not constitute a formal story submission but the Collins case was historical in nature and as such was not protected by copyright laws. In December 1953, Judge [[Stanley Mosk]] ruled in favor of Wilder and Paramount. Desny appealed and in August 1956 the [[California Supreme Court]] ruled his oral submission had been legitimate. Wilder's attorneys settled that same month, paying Desny $14,350 ({{Inflation|US|14,350|1956|r=-3|fmt=eq}}).{{sfn|Sikov|1998|p=327-28}}<ref name=tcmnotes/>\n\n===Writing===\nIn the original script, Tatum colluded with the local sheriff. [[Joseph Breen]] of the [[Production Code|Hays Code]] office strongly objected to the on-screen depiction of a corrupt law enforcement officer and insisted Wilder add dialogue making it clear the man eventually would be made to answer for his actions.{{sfn|Sikov|1998|p=318}}\n\n===Filming===\nThe final cost of the film was $1,821,052, of which $250,000 was paid to Wilder as writer, producer, and director.{{sfn|Sikov|1998|p=325}} Its exterior set, ({{Coord|35|23|49|N|109|01|09|W|}}), which was constructed 19 miles west of [[Gallup, New Mexico|Gallup]], was the largest non-combat set ever constructed at the time.

In his review in ''[[The New York Times]]'', [[Bosley Crowther]] called it \"a masterly film\" but added, \"Mr. Wilder has let imagination so fully take command of his yarn that it presents not only a distortion of journalistic practice but something of a dramatic grotesque{{nbsp}}... [it] is badly weakened by a poorly constructed plot, which depends for its strength upon assumptions that are not only na\u00efve but absurd.
