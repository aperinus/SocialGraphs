It was praised for its direction, performances, and screenplay; Swinton's performance was particularly lauded. ''Michael Clayton'' was nominated for seven [[80th Academy Awards|Academy Awards]]: [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]], Best Original Score, [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay|Best Original Screenplay]], [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] for Clooney, [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Supporting Actor]] for Wilkinson, and [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]] for Swinton, which she won.\n\n==Plot==\nMichael Clayton is a \"[[Cleaner (crime)|fixer]]\" for a prestigious New York City [[law firm]], using his connections and knowledge of legal loopholes for clients' benefit. One night, Michael leaves a poker game to attend to a client who has been involved in a hit-and-run crash. Driving home, he sees three horses in a field. He stops, gets out of his car and approaches them. Behind him, a bomb detonates in his car.\n\nFour days earlier, a [[loan shark]] gives Michael a week to raise $75,000 after a failed investment in a restaurant he made with his brother Timmy. He asks his boss, Marty Bach, for a loan to cover the expenses; Marty insinuates that the firm will be finished if Michael does not get Arthur Edens, one of the firm's leading attorneys, under control. Arthur has a [[manic episode]] in the middle of a [[Deposition (law)|deposition]] in Milwaukee. The deposition involves a multi-billion-dollar six-year [[class action|class action lawsuit]] against U-North, an agricultural products [[Conglomerate (company)|conglomerate]] Arthur's firm is representing. Michael arrives in Milwaukee and bails Arthur out of jail after learning he is no longer taking his medication, but Arthur escapes from their hotel room during the night and returns to New York.\n\nKaren Crowder, U-North's [[general counsel]], discovers that Arthur has a confidential U-North memo proving the company knew its weed killer was [[carcinogen]]ic, which led to 468 deaths. She brings this to the attention of U-North CEO Don Jeffries, whose signature is on the memo. Don puts her in contact with two hitmen; she has them follow Arthur and bug his apartment and phone.\n\nMichael finds Arthur on a Manhattan street and confronts him about calls he made to Anna Kaiserson, one of the [[plaintiff]]s in the lawsuit. Arthur realizes his calls are being monitored. He calls his own voicemail at the firm and says he will go public with the memo. Karen authorizes the hitmen to take \"drastic measures\". They break into Arthur's apartment, kill him, and make it look like suicide.\n\nAfter learning of Arthur's death, Michael becomes suspicious when he discovers that U-North was planning a settlement just a few days before, and that Arthur had booked a flight to New York for Anna. He finds Anna and learns that no one knew of her conversations with Arthur, yet Michael's firm knew of Arthur's conversations with the U-North plaintiffs. With help from his brother Gene, a police officer, he breaks into Arthur's sealed apartment. He finds champagne and two glasses in the refrigerator, a copy of a fantasy novel beloved by Michael's son Henry, with several pages highlighted and annotated by Arthur, and a receipt from a photocopy shop.\n\nThe hitmen, who have been trailing Michael, call the police as he enters the apartment. He is caught and arrested for trespassing, but Gene bails him out. Using the receipt, Michael discovers that Arthur ordered 2,000 copies of the confidential U-North memo. The hitmen also obtain a copy, which they give Karen. Believing Michael is blackmailing the firm, Marty offers him a renewed contract and the $80,000 he had requested on the condition he sign a [[non-disclosure agreement]]. Michael realizes that Marty and Barry Grissom, another attorney at the firm, know about U-North's cover-up. After paying Timmy's debt, he goes to play poker.\n\nThe hitmen rig Michael's car with a bomb while Michael plays poker. Driving past a field, he sees some horses and leaves his car to approach them. While he is in the field, the bomb detonates. Michael escapes into the woods. At a U-North board meeting, Karen proposes that the board approve a new settlement in the lawsuit. Michael confronts her in the foyer and goads her into offering him $10 million for his silence. Karen reluctantly agrees; Michael reveals that he is wearing a [[covert listening device|wire]], with Gene and other [[New York City Police Department|NYPD]] detectives listening. As Karen and Don are arrested, Michael gets into a cab and rides away.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[George Clooney]] as Michael Clayton, attorney at Kenner, Bach, and Ledeen\n* [[Tom Wilkinson]] as Arthur Edens, attorney at Kenner, Bach, and Ledeen\n* [[Tilda Swinton]] as Karen Crowder, counsel at U-North\n* [[Sydney Pollack]] as Marty Bach, managing partner at Kenner, Bach, and Ledeen\n* [[Michael O'Keefe]] as Barry Grissom, attorney at Kenner, Bach, and Ledeen\n* Sean Cullen as Gene Clayton, Michael's brother, a police detective<!-- Do NOT Wikilink to the wrong person!
