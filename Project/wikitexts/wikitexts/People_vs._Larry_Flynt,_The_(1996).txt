The screenplay, written by [[Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski]], spans about 35 years of Flynt's life, from his impoverished upbringing in Kentucky to his court battle with [[Reverend Jerry Falwell]], and is based in part on the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] case ''[[Hustler Magazine v. Falwell]]''.\n\nIn addition to being a financial success, ''The People vs. Larry Flynt'' was acclaimed by critics and garnered Harrelson, Love, Norton and Forman multiple accolades and award nominations, including [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] for Harrelson and [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]] for Forman at the [[69th Academy Awards]]. Forman won the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Director]].\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1952, 10-year-old [[Larry Flynt]] is selling [[moonshine]] in [[Kentucky]]. Twenty years later, Flynt and his younger brother, Jimmy, run the Hustler Go-Go club in [[Cincinnati]]. With profits down, Flynt decides to publish a newsletter for the club, the first ''[[Hustler (magazine)|Hustler]]'' magazine, with nude pictures of women working at the club. The newsletter soon becomes a full-fledged magazine, but sales are weak. After ''Hustler'' publishes nude pictures of former first lady [[Jackie Kennedy Onassis]] in 1972, sales take off.\n\nFlynt becomes smitten with [[Althea Flynt|Althea Leasure]], a stripper who works at one of his clubs. With Althea and Jimmy's help, Flynt makes a fortune from sales of ''Hustler''. With his success comes enemies \u2013 as he finds himself a hated figure of [[anti-pornography]] activists. He argues with the activists, saying that \"murder is illegal, but if you take a picture of it, you may get your name in a magazine or maybe win a [[Pulitzer Prize]]. However, sex is legal, but if you take a picture of that act, you can go to jail.\" He becomes involved in several prominent court cases, and befriends a young lawyer, [[Alan Isaacman]]. In 1975, Flynt loses a smut-peddling court decision in Cincinnati, but the decision is overturned on appeal; he is released from jail soon afterwards. [[Ruth Carter Stapleton]], a Christian activist and sister of President [[Jimmy Carter]], seeks out Flynt and urges him to give his life to Jesus. Flynt seems moved and starts letting his newfound religion influence everything in his life, including ''Hustler'' content. Althea detests the idea as she was molested by nuns during her years in Catholic School.\n\nIn 1978, during another trial in Georgia, Flynt and Isaacman are both shot by a [[Joseph Paul Franklin|man with a rifle]] while they walk outside a courthouse. Isaacman recovers, but Flynt is paralyzed from the waist down and uses a wheelchair for the rest of his life. Wishing he was dead, Flynt renounces his faith. Because of the emotional and physical pain, he moves to [[Beverly Hills]] and spirals down into depression and drug use. During this time, Althea also becomes addicted to painkillers and morphine.\n\nIn 1983, Flynt undergoes surgery to deaden several nerves in his back damaged by the bullet wounds, and as a result, feels rejuvenated. He returns to an active role with the publication, which, in his absence, had been run by Althea and Jimmy. Flynt is soon in court again for leaking videos relating to the [[John DeLorean]] entrapment case, and during his courtroom antics, he fires Isaacman, then throws an orange at the judge. He later wears an American flag as an adult diaper along with an Army helmet, and wears T-shirts with provocative messages such as \"I Wish I Was Black\" and \"Fuck This Court.\" After spitting water at the judge Flynt is sent to a [[psychiatric ward]], where he sinks into depression again. Flynt publishes a satirical parody ad in which [[Jerry Falwell]] tells of a drunken sexual encounter with his mother. Falwell sues for [[libel]] and emotional distress. Flynt countersues for [[copyright infringement]], because Falwell copied his ad and used it to raise funds for his legal bills. The case goes to trial in December 1984, but the decision is mixed, as Flynt is found guilty of inflicting emotional distress but not libel. By that time, Althea has contracted [[HIV]], which proceeds to [[AIDS]]. Some time later in 1987, Flynt finds her dead in the bathtub, having drowned.\n\nFlynt presses Isaacman to appeal the Falwell decision to the [[Supreme Court of the United States]]. Isaacman refuses, saying Flynt's courtroom antics humiliated him. Flynt pleads with him, saying that he \"wants to be remembered for something meaningful\". Isaacman agrees and argues the \"emotional distress\" decision in front of the Supreme Court, in the case ''[[Hustler Magazine v. Falwell]]'' in 1988. With Flynt sitting silently in the courtroom, the court overturns the original verdict in a unanimous decision. After the trial, Flynt is alone in his bedroom watching old videotapes of a happy healthy Althea and himself before tragedy struck them both.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Woody Harrelson]] as [[Larry Flynt]]\n** Cody Block as young Larry\n* [[Courtney Love]] as [[Althea Flynt|Althea Leasure]]\n* [[Edward Norton]] as [[Alan Isaacman]]\n* [[Brett Harrelson]] as [[Jimmy Flynt]]\n** Ryan Post as young Jimmy\n* [[Donna Hanover]] as [[Ruth Carter Stapleton]]\n* [[James Cromwell]] as [[Charles Keating]]\n* [[Crispin Glover]] as Arlo\n* [[Vincent Schiavelli]] as Chester\n* [[Miles Chapin]] as Miles\n* [[James Carville]] as [[Simon L.
