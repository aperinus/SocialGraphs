Zanuck]]. The screenplay by [[Ernest Lehman]] is based on the 1951 [[Rodgers and Hammerstein]] musical ''[[The King and I]]'', based on the 1944 novel ''[[Anna and the King of Siam (novel)|Anna and the King of Siam]]'' by [[Margaret Landon]]. That novel in turn was based on memoirs written by [[Anna Leonowens]], who became school teacher to the children of King [[Mongkut]] of [[Thailand|Siam]] in the early 1860s. Leonowens' stories were autobiographical, although various elements of them have been called into question.<ref>Susan Morgan, ''Bombay Anna: The Real Story and Remarkable Adventures of the King and I Governess'' (University of California Press, 2008)</ref> The film stars [[Deborah Kerr]] and [[Yul Brynner]].\n\nThe film was a critical and commercial success, and was nominated for 9 [[Academy Awards|Oscars]], winning 5, including [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] for Brynner.\n\nAn [[The King and I (1999 film)|animated film adaptation]] of the same musical was released in 1999. On February 12, 2021, [[Paramount Pictures]] and [[Temple Hill Entertainment]] announced that another live-action film version was in development.\n\n==Plot==\nA widowed schoolteacher, [[Anna Leonowens|Anna]], arrives in Bangkok with her young son, Louis, after being summoned to tutor the many children of King [[Mongkut]]. Both are introduced to the intimidating Kralahome, Siam's prime minister, who escorts them to the Royal Palace, where they will live, although Anna had been promised her own house. The King ignores her objections and introduces her to his head wife, Lady Thiang. Anna also meets a recent [[concubine]], a young Burmese, Tuptim, and the fifteen children she will tutor, including his son and heir, Prince [[Chulalongkorn]]. In conversation with the other wives, Anna learns Tuptim is in love with Lun Tha, who brought her to Siam.\n\nAnna still wants her own house and teaches the children about the virtues of home life, to the King's irritation, who disapproves of the influence of other cultures. She comes across Lun Tha and learns that he has been meeting Tuptim in secret. He asks her to arrange a rendezvous. The lovers meet under cover of darkness, and Lun Tha promises he will one day return to Siam and that they will escape together.\n\nKing Mongkut becomes troubled over rumors that the British regard him as a barbaric leader and are sending a delegation, including Anna's old admirer, Sir Edward, possibly to turn Siam into a protectorate. Anna persuades the King to receive them in European style by hosting a banquet with European food and music. In return, the King promises to give Anna her own house.\n\nSir Edward reminisces with Anna in an attempt to bring her back to British society. The King presents Tuptim's version of ''[[Uncle Tom's Cabin]]'' as a traditional Siamese ballet. However, the King and the Kralahome are not impressed, as the play involves slavery and shows the slaveholding King drowning in the river. During the show, Tuptim left the room to run away with Lun Tha.\n\nAfter the guests have departed, the king reveals that Tuptim is missing. Anna explains that Tuptim is unhappy because she is just another woman in his eyes. The King retorts that men are entitled to a plenitude of wives, although women must remain faithful. Anna explains the reality of one man loving only one woman and recalls her first dance before she teaches the King how to dance the polka, but the touching moment is shattered when the Kralahome bursts into the room with the news Tuptim has been captured. For her dishonor, the King prepares to whip her despite Anna's pleas. She declares he is indeed a barbarian. The King then crumples, puts his hand over his heart, and runs out of the room. The Kralahome blames Anna for ruining him as Tuptim is led away in tears after learning Lun Tha was found dead and dumped into the river. That causes Anna to sever all ties as a governess and declare she will leave on the next boat from Siam.\n\nOn the night of her departure, Anna learns that the King is dying. Lady Thiang gives Anna his unfinished letter stating his deep gratitude and respect for her, despite their differences. Moments before the ship departs, he gives Anna his ring, as she has always spoken the truth to him, and persuades her and Louis to stay in Bangkok. He passes his title to Prince Chulalongkorn, who then issues a proclamation that ends slavery and states that all subjects will no longer bow down to him. The King dies, satisfied that his kingdom will be all right, and Anna lovingly presses her cheek to his hand.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Deborah Kerr]] as [[Anna Leonowens]]\n* [[Yul Brynner]] as [[Mongkut|King Mongkut of Siam]]\n* [[Rita Moreno]] as Tuptim\n* [[Terry Saunders]] as Lady Thiang\n* [[Martin Benson (actor)|Martin Benson]] as Kralahome\n* Rex Thompson as [[Louis T.

However, she was diagnosed with cancer while playing the role on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] and died during the run. [[Dinah Shore]], a singer as well as an actress, was considered for the role of Anna in the movie. [[Maureen O'Hara]], who had a pleasant [[soprano]] voice, was originally cast, but [[Richard Rodgers]] did not agree to the casting. It was [[Yul Brynner]] who pressed for [[Deborah Kerr]] to play the role. [[Marni Nixon]] provided Kerr's singing for the film.<ref name=\"rodgers\"/> Nixon and Kerr worked side-by-side in the recording studio for songs which combined speaking and singing. Nixon would also dub Kerr's singing the following year, for the film ''[[An Affair to Remember]]''.\n\nDonald Bogle's biography of [[Dorothy Dandridge]] claims that Dandridge was offered the role of Tuptim in partial fulfillment of her three-picture contract with [[20th Century-Fox]], but that Dandridge allowed [[Otto Preminger]] (her former director and then-lover) to talk her out of it because it was not the lead role. Rumors also circulated that Dandridge, as an [[African American]], did not want to play a slave. [[Rita Moreno]], who was under contract to Fox, was invited merely for a test, but impressed the producers enough to be selected for the part.<ref name=\"dvd50th\">Carlos Rivas (interview). ''The King and I: 50th Anniversary Edition'' DVD, disc 2 special features, 2006.</ref> Moreno later stated in an interview that [[France Nuyen]] was also up for the part, and Moreno believed Nuyen would get it, but since Nuyen was not a contract player with the studio, she was not cast.\n\nReprising their Broadway stage roles, Saunders played Thiang, Adiarte was Chulalongkorn and Benson was the Kralahome, and dancers Yuriko and de Lappe also reprised their stage roles. [[Alan Mowbray]] appeared in the new role of the British Ambassador, while Sir Edward Ramsey (demoted to the Ambassador's aide) was played by [[Geoffrey Toone]].<ref>Hischak, p. 151</ref><ref name=NYTimes56>[https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/27374/The-King-and-I/credits \"''The King and I'' (1956): Production credits\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121104061802/http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/27374/The-King-and-I/credits |date=2012-11-04 }}, ''[[The New York Times]]''.

In the film, the first half of the \"Song of the King\" was turned into ordinary spoken dialogue, with only some of the words sung, minus the king's opening lyrics, but it survives as it was actually written on the soundtrack album.\n\nA special 50th Anniversary edition was released in 2006, which promised to restore the lost numbers, but it included only the audio and some still photographs for \"Shall I Tell You?\"  This would seem to indicate that no footage exists of these numbers. An off-screen choral reprise of \"Something Wonderful\" was added to serve as the film's finale; the stage version ends with musical underscoring, but no singing. None of the other reprises of the songs were retained in the film version.\n\nThe film was one of the only two films shot in the then-new 55&nbsp;mm [[CinemaScope 55]] format, the other being ''[[Carousel (film)|Carousel]]'', which was released several months earlier. Although the promotion for the film made much of it being shot in CinemaScope 55, it was only released in the standard 35&nbsp;mm [[CinemaScope]] format, with 4-channel stereo instead of the 6-channel stereo originally promised. CinemaScope 55 was never used or promoted again after this production, and Fox would later invest in Todd-AO and adopt its 65/70mm process, after changing it to the more conventional 24 frames/second, and contracting with [[Mitchell Camera]] for all-new FC (\"Fox Camera\") and BFC (\"Blimped Fox Camera\") cameras, and with [[Bausch & Lomb]] for all-new \"Super Baltar\" lenses.

It restored three songs recorded for the film but not included in the final release print: \"My Lord and Master\", \"I Have Dreamed\", and \"Shall I Tell You What I Think of You?\". The latter two were filmed but no footage survives. Added to the original LP and CD releases of the film was a seven-minute overture not heard at the beginning of the film. The album was first issued only in mono in 1956, but, as with the [[Rodgers and Hammerstein]] films ''[[Oklahoma! (1955 film)|Oklahoma!]]'' (1955) and ''[[Carousel (1956 film)|Carousel]]'' (1956), the sound on the film had been recorded in what was then [[state-of-the-art]] stereo, which made it possible, with the advent of stereo on records, for Capitol to release a stereo version of the soundtrack album in 1958. As with ''Oklahoma!'' and ''Carousel'', the [[Disc cutting lathe|recording lathes]] of that time made it necessary for part of the album to be omitted in the stereo version, so half of \"Getting To Know You\" was cut in that edition.\n\nThe film soundtrack album of ''The King and I'' was issued on CD first by Capitol and then by [[Angel Records]]. The first two editions of the CD were exact duplicates of the LP, but in 2001, as with the ''Oklahoma!'' and ''Carousel'' soundtracks, Angel issued a new, expanded edition of the album, which not only featured all the songs (including the ballet \"The Small House of Uncle Thomas\"), but some of the film's [[incidental music]], as well as the original [[main title]] music. The Overture heard on the LP version and on the first two editions of the CD was included as a bonus track.\n\n===Chart positions===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!Chart\n!Year\n!Peak<br>position\n|-\n|rowspan=\"3\"|[[UK Albums Chart]]<ref>{{cite web  |url=https://www.officialcharts.com/archive/official-albums-chart/  |title=The Official Charts Company&nbsp;\u2013 Original Soundtrack&nbsp;\u2013 The King And I  |work=[[Official Charts Company]]  |access-date=8 May 2011  }}</ref>\n|align=\"left\"|1956\n|rowspan=\"3\" align=\"center\"|1\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|1957\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|1958\n|-\n|}\n\n==Awards and nominations==\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n!
