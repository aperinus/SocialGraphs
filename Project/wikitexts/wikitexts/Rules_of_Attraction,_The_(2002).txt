It was distributed by [[Lionsgate Films]]. Its story follows three Camden College students who become entangled in a love triangle  with a drug dealer, a virgin, and a bisexual classmate. It stars [[James Van Der Beek]], [[Shannyn Sossamon]], [[Ian Somerhalder]], [[Jessica Biel]], [[Kate Bosworth]], [[Kip Pardue]], and [[Joel Michaely]].\n\nThe film was produced by Kingsgate Films, Roger Avary, and Filmproduktion and was released on October 11, 2002. It grossed $2.5 million in its opening weekend and $11.8 million worldwide, against a budget of $4 million.<ref name=\"mojo\" /> It received mixed reviews from critics.<ref name=\"tomatoes\" /><ref name=\"metacritic\" />\n\n==Plot==\nSet in the fictional Camden College in [[New Hampshire]], the film opens at the \"End of the World\" party, where students Lauren Hynde, Paul Denton, and Sean Bateman give apathetic interior monologues on their lives and briefly exchange glances with one another. Lauren, previously a virgin, takes a film student upstairs to have sex and passes out; she wakes to find herself being ostensibly raped by a [[Town and gown|townie]] while the film student records it, and reflects on how she had planned to lose her virginity to Victor, her now ex-boyfriend. Meanwhile, Paul, who is bisexual, tries to have sex with a jock, only to be [[Gay bashing|bashed]] when the jock, deeply in the closet, rejects his advances. A bruised and beaten Sean is shown drinking a whole bottle of [[Jack Daniel's]], tearing up a series of purple letters, before approaching and having sex with a blonde girl at the party.\n\nThe plot then moves backwards several months to the beginning of the school year, and explores the [[love triangle]] between Lauren, Paul, and Sean. Misinterpreting Sean's willingness to spend time with him, Paul makes several advances, to which Sean is oblivious. Paul fantasizes about having sex with Sean while [[masturbating]]. Concurrently, Lauren also finds herself attracted to Sean despite saving her virginity for her traveling boyfriend, Victor. Sean reciprocates her feelings, and assumes the anonymous, purple love letters he has started receiving are from Lauren. Sean masturbates to reading these letters and fantasizes about Lauren.\n\nWhile Paul is visiting his friend \"Dick\", Sean has sex with Lauren's roommate Lara at the \"Dressed to Get Screwed\" party. Sean regrets it immediately, and realizes that he is in love with Lauren. It is then revealed that another, unnamed cafeteria girl is the author of Sean's love letters; after seeing him leave the party with Lara, she sends him a suicide note before cutting her wrists in the dorm bathtub. Lauren, finding Sean with Lara, runs to the girls' bathroom in tears, only to find the unnamed girl's body, leaving Lauren extremely distressed. Sean, still believing Lauren wrote the purple letters, misinterprets the unnamed girl's suicide note and assumes Lauren never wants to be with him. Lauren decides to lose her virginity to her Art History professor Lance Lawson. But being married and worried about losing his tenure, he simply allows her to perform [[fellatio]] on him instead.\n\nAfter numerous failed attempts at suicide, Sean fakes his death and, unaware that Lauren recently found a corpse, unintentionally upsets her further when she finds him pretending to be dead. After stealing drugs from dealer Rupert, Sean tries to speak to Lauren again, asking only to know her. Lauren tells Sean he will never know her, and abandons him. She approaches Victor, who has finally returned to Camden College, only to find that Victor is having sex with Lara and does not remember who Lauren is, leaving her completely distraught.\n\nPaul, upon finding a drunk Sean, tries to talk to him, parroting Sean's own words by saying he merely wants to know him. Sean coldly rejects him, using Lauren's words to say that Paul will never know him. Paul throws a snowball at Sean, then angrily runs off in tears. Sean checks his campus mailbox in vain, only to find that the love notes have stopped. He is then cornered by Rupert and his Jamaican partner, Guest, and brutally beaten.\n\nThe three protagonists then attend the \"End of the World\" party and the plot returns to the introduction. After seeing Lauren heading upstairs with the film student, Sean finally accepts he cannot be with her, and tears up the purple letters he believes to be from her. It is then revealed that, rather than having sex with the blonde girl as he does in the intro, Sean has an epiphany, reconsiders and he instead leaves his drink and exits. Paul and Lauren meet on the house porch and reflect on the recent events, as well as on Sean, whom they watch depart on his motorcycle. Sean begins narrating his final thoughts only for them to end prematurely as the film cuts to the end credits, which are run backwards.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[James Van Der Beek]] as Sean Bateman, a [[drug dealer]] from [[Berlin, New Hampshire]] (the character is the younger brother of [[Patrick Bateman]], the main character of ''[[American Psycho]]'')                                                                                              \n* [[Shannyn Sossamon]] as Lauren Hynde, a [[virgin]] who is saving herself for Victor, her ex-boyfriend                            \n* [[Ian Somerhalder]] as Paul Denton, Lauren's bisexual ex-boyfriend\n* [[Jessica Biel]] as Lara Holleran, Lauren's promiscuous roommate\n* [[Kate Bosworth]] as Kelly, a girl from the party whom Sean takes back to his room\n* [[Kip Pardue]] as Victor Johnson, Lauren's promiscuous ex-boyfriend\n* [[Clifton Collins Jr.|Clifton Collins, Jr.]] as Rupert Guest, a high-strung drug dealer\n* [[Thomas Ian Nicholas]] as Mitchell Allen, a weaselly cohort who seems to idolize brutish Victor\n* [[Faye Dunaway]] as Mrs. Eve Denton, Paul's mother\n* [[Eric Stoltz]] as Mr. Lance Lawson, a college instructor who seduces Lauren\n* [[Fred Savage]] as Marc, a heroin-addicted student who owes Sean money for drugs\n* [[Theresa Wayman]] as Food Service Girl\n* [[Jay Baruchel]] as Harry, a \"friend\" of Paul's\n* [[Joel Michaely]] as Raymond, a student\n* [[Clare Kramer]] as Candice, a student and party girl\n* Russell Sams as Richard \"Dick\" Jared, an old friend of Paul's\n* [[Swoosie Kurtz]] as Mimi Jared, Richard's uptight mother\n* [[Ron Jeremy|Ron Jeremy Hyatt]] as the Piano Player\n* [[Paul Williams (songwriter)|Paul Williams]] as Duty Doctor\n* [[Casper Van Dien]] as [[Patrick Bateman]] (scenes filmed but were not included in the final cut)<ref>{{cite web|title=The Rules of Attraction (2002) Trivia|website=[[IMDb]] |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0292644/trivia|access-date=July 28, 2020}}, ''IMDb Trivia''</ref>\n\n==Production==\nThe film was shot at the [[University of Redlands]] in California.<ref>{{Cite book|title = The Insider's Guide to the Colleges, 2012: Students on Campus Tell You What You Really Want to Know, 38th Edition|last = Yale Daily News Staff|publisher = St. Martin's Griffin|year = 2011|pages = 101}}</ref>\n\nThe film was one of the first studio motion pictures to be edited using [[Final Cut Pro]].

It also includes more content in commentary tracks than the other DVDs available.\n\nThe uncut version was shown at UK cinemas. However, the [[British Board of Film Classification|BBFC]], under its power as censor under the [[Video Recordings Act 1984]], shortened the suicide scene, even at the highest (18+) rating.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bbfc.co.uk/website/Classified.nsf/0/CA52711F0088722880256D91001B6213?OpenDocument |title=''The Rules of Attraction'' rated 18 by the BBFC |publisher=[[British Board of Film Classification]] |date=2003-08-27 |access-date=2011-07-24 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110525030241/http://www.bbfc.co.uk/website/Classified.nsf/0/CA52711F0088722880256D91001B6213?OpenDocument |archive-date=May 25, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nThe home release of the film was supposed to include a commentary from Bret Easton Ellis.

Where Ms. Harron shrewdly created a surreal, high-styled ambiance for Mr. Ellis's monstrous humanoids to rattle around in, Mr. Avary wants to convince us that his movie's dissipated symbols of late capitalist excess really exist.
