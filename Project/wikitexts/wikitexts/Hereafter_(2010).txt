The screenplay written by [[Peter Morgan]]. The film tells three parallel stories about three people affected by death in similar ways{{mdash}}all three have issues of communicating with the dead; [[Matt Damon]] plays American factory worker George, who is able to communicate with the dead and who has worked professionally as a [[Clairvoyance|clairvoyant]], but no longer wants to communicate with the dead; [[C\u00e9cile de France]] plays French television journalist Marie, who survives a [[near-death experience]] during the [[2004 Indian Ocean tsunami]]; and British schoolboy Marcus (played by [[Frankie and George McLaren]]), who loses the person closest to him. [[Bryce Dallas Howard]], [[Lyndsey Marshal]], [[Jay Mohr]], and [[Thierry Neuvic]] have supporting roles.\n\nMorgan sold the script [[Spec script|on spec]] to [[DreamWorks Pictures|DreamWorks]] in 2008, but it transferred to [[Warner Bros.]] by the time Eastwood (who has a long-standing relationship with Warner Bros.) had signed on to direct in 2009. Principal photography ran from October 2009 to February 2010 on locations in [[London]], [[San Francisco]], [[Paris]], and [[Hawaii]].\n\n''Hereafter'' premiered as a \"Special Presentation\" at the [[2010 Toronto International Film Festival]] on September 12, 2010. The film was given a [[limited release]] on October 15, 2010 and was released across North America on October 22, 2010. Although a box office success, the film received mixed reviews, with critics praising the plot and acting performances, while noting that the movie suffered from a lack of focus on the story.\n\n==Plot==\nOn assignment in [[India]], French television journalist Marie Lelay is caught in the [[2004 Indian Ocean tsunami]]. Pulled lifeless from the water, she is resuscitated but left for dead. She gasps back to life after glimpsing the [[afterlife]]. Marie is reunited with her lover Didier after and they return to [[Paris]]. The experience interferes with her work, so Didier (also her producer) gives her a leave of absence.\n\nIn [[San Francisco]], George Lonegan reluctantly agrees to perform a [[psychic reading]] for Christos, a wealthy client of his brother Billy. An actual [[Mediumship|medium]], George quit as a psychic due to the emotional, disturbing impact of communicating with the dead. George asks if \u201cJune\u201d means anything, which Christos denies; later he tells Billy that June was his late wife's nurse, with whom he was in love.\n\nIn London, 12-year-old twins Jason and Marcus try to prevent their alcoholic, [[heroin]]-addicted mother Jackie from losing them to [[social services]]. Evading the authorities, Jackie sends Jason to the [[chemist]] to pick up her detox prescription, having finally decided to get clean. Running from street thugs, Jason is hit by a van and killed. Social services then put Marcus into a foster home.\n\nMarie travels to [[Switzerland]] to meet a [[hospice]] director, a former skeptic now convinced the afterlife exists. She persuades Marie to write a book on her experience, in hopes the scientific community will accept the reality of life beyond death.\n\nDesperate for a reunion with his brother, Marcus steals money from his foster parents and seeks help to contact Jason, but only encounters frauds. Boarding the [[London underground]] at [[Charing Cross]], Jason's cap blows off Marcus\u2019 head. Anxious to find it, he misses his train, which explodes during the [[7 July 2005 London bombings|2005 London Bombings]].\n\nAt a cooking class, George is partnered with Melanie. Hitting it off, they prepare dinner at George's home, where a phone message from Billy forces him to reveal his ability as a psychic. Melanie persuades George to contact the spirit of her father, who asks forgiveness for what he did to her as a child. Melanie flees in tears, and does not return to the cooking class.\n\nHaving been in talks with a publisher about a biography of [[Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand]], Marie stuns them with her new manuscript: \"''Hereafter: A Conspiracy of Silence''\". The publisher rejects the work, but steers her toward another in London. Marie learns Didier does not intend to give back her job, as her reputation has been damaged from her interest in the hereafter, and he is sleeping with another woman, effectively ending their relationship.\n\nLaid off from his factory job, George is persuaded by Billy to revive his psychic practice. However, he impulsively travels to London, on a Dickens kick, listening to [[Derek Jacobi]]\u2019s audiobooks, visiting the [[Charles Dickens Museum]] and attending Jacobi's live reading at the [[London Book Fair]], where Marie is also reading her now published book, ''Hereafter''. Handing George a signed copy, he has a flash of her near-drowning.\n\nAt the event with his foster parents, Marcus spots George, who he has read about online. George brushes him off and returns to his hotel, but Marcus stands outside until George agrees to do a reading. Through George, Jason tells Marcus he is happy in the afterlife, and that he had knocked off his cap to save Marcus at the train station, and not to fear being alone \"because we are one\". With this closure, Marcus visits his mother, who is improving in a rehab center.\n\nGeorge leaves a note for Marie, inviting her to a caf\u00e9, He has a vision of them kissing. Their shared glimpses of the hereafter having made them better appreciate life, George and Marie sit together.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:NYFF 2010 \"Hereafter\" Press Conference.jpg|thumb|300px|NYFF 2010 \"Hereafter\" Press Conference]]\n* [[Matt Damon]] as George Lonegan, \"a reluctant [[psychic]] [...] who can speak to the dead but prefers not to\".<ref name=RH>Random House (undated). \"[http://book.co.za/bookchat/topic/the-london-book-fair-to-star-in-clint-eastwoods-next-film-hereafter The London Book Fair to Star in Clint Eastwood's Next Film, Hereafter]{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}\".
