Called in to substitute for a village teacher for one month, Wei is told not to lose any students. When one of the boys takes off in search of work in the big city, she goes looking for him. The film addresses [[Education in the People's Republic of China#Development|education reform in China]], the economic gap between urban and rural populations, and the prevalence of bureaucracy and authority figures in everyday life. It is filmed in a [[Neorealism (art)|neorealist]]/[[documentary film|documentary]] style with a troupe of non-professional actors who play characters with the same names and occupations as the actors have in real life, blurring the boundaries between drama and reality.\n\nThe domestic release of ''Not One Less'' was accompanied by a Chinese government campaign aimed at promoting the film and cracking down on [[Copyright infringement|piracy]]. Internationally, the film was generally well-received, but it also attracted criticism for its ostensibly political message; foreign critics are divided on whether the film should be read as praising or criticizing the Chinese government. When the film was excluded from the [[1999&nbsp;Cannes Film Festival]]'s competition section, Zhang withdrew it and another film from the festival, and published a letter rebuking Cannes for politicization of and \"discrimination\" against Chinese cinema. The film went on to win the [[Venice Film Festival]]'s [[Golden Lion]] and several other awards, and Zhang won the award for best director at the [[Golden Rooster Awards]].\n\n== Background ==\nIn the 1990s, primary education reform had become one of the top priorities in the People's Republic of China. About 160&nbsp;million Chinese people had missed all or part of their education because of the [[Cultural Revolution]] in the late 1960s and early 1970s,<ref name=\"Wang344\">{{Harvnb|Wang|2002|p=344}}.</ref> and in 1986 the [[National People's Congress]] enacted a law calling for nine years of compulsory education.<ref name=\"Wang340\">{{Harvnb|Wang|2002|p=340}}.</ref> By 1993, it was clear that much of the country was making little progress on implementing nine-year compulsory education, so the 1993\u20132000&nbsp;seven-year plan focused on this goal. One of the major challenges educators faced was the large number of rural schoolchildren dropping out to pursue work.<ref name=\"Wang346\">{{Harvnb|Wang|2002|p=346}}.</ref> Another issue was a large urban\u2013rural divide: funding and teacher quality were far better in urban schools than rural, and urban students stayed in school longer.<ref>{{Harvnb|Knight|Shi|Song|2006|p=46}}.</ref>\n\n== Production and cast ==\n''Not One Less'' was Zhang Yimou's ninth film, but only the second not to star long-time collaborator [[Gong Li]] (the first was his 1997 ''[[Keep Cool (film)|Keep Cool]]'').<ref name=\"losingamuse\">{{cite web | work=[[The New York Times]] | title=Losing a Muse and Moving On | last=Feinstein | first=Howard | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/02/06/movies/losing-a-muse-and-moving-on.html?pagewanted=all | date=6 February 2000 | access-date=9 September 2009}}</ref> For this film, he cast only amateur actors whose real-life names and occupations resembled those of characters they played in the film\u2014as ''[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]''{{'}}s Steven Rea described the performances, the actors are just \"people playing variations of themselves in front of the camera\".<ref name=\"philly\" /> For instance, Tian Zhenda, who played the mayor, was the real-life mayor of a small village,<ref name=Kraicer85>{{Harvnb|Kraicer|2001|p=85}}.</ref> and the primary actors Wei Minzhi and Zhang Huike were selected from among thousands of students in rural schools.<ref name=\"losingamuse\" /><ref name=\"Wu128\">{{Harvnb|Wu|2001|p=128}}.</ref> (The names and occupations of the film's main actors<ref name=\"NOLcredits\" /><ref>{{cite web | url = http://eladies.sina.com.cn/yige/yige_chengyuan.html | title=\u4e00\u4e2a\u90fd\u4e0d\u80fd\u5c11 \u5267\u7ec4\u6210\u5458 (\"Not One Less\" cast/crew members) | access-date=4 October 2009 | publisher=[[Sina.com]]|language=zh}}</ref> are listed in the table below.)

When Gao discovers that Wei does not have a high school education and has no special talents, he instructs her to teach by copying his texts onto the board and then making the students copy them into their notebooks; he also tells her not to use more than one piece of chalk per day, because the village is too poor to afford more. Before leaving, he explains to her that many students have recently left school to find work in the cities, and he offers her a 10 [[Chinese yuan|yuan]] bonus if all the students are still there when he returns.\n\n{{Quote box | quote=Wei Minzhi, you look after the students.

Early in the month, a sports recruiter comes to take one athletic girl, Ming Xinhong, to a special training school; unwilling to let any students leave, Wei hides Ming, and when the village mayor (Tian Zhenda) finds her, Wei chases after their car in a futile attempt to stop them; and yet they, the sports recruiter and mayor, first notice and comment on Wei's running ability, endurance, and tenacity.\n\nOne day, after trying to make the troublemaker Zhang apologize for bothering another student, Wei discovers that Zhang has left to go find work in the nearby city of [[Zhangjiakou]]. The village mayor is unwilling to give her money for a bus ticket to the city, so she resolves to earn the money herself, and recruits the remaining students to help. One girl suggests that they can make money by moving bricks in a nearby brickyard, and Wei begins giving the students mathematical exercises centered on finding out how much money they need to earn for the bus tickets, how many bricks they need to move, and how much time it will take. Through these exercises and working to earn money, her rapport with the class improves. After earning the money, she reaches the bus station but learns that the price is higher than she thought, and she cannot afford a ticket. Wei ends up walking most of the way to Zhangjiakou.\n\n{{Location map+|China|float=right|caption=Location of [[Zhangjiakou]], relative to [[Beijing]]|places=\n{{Location map~|China|lat_deg=40|lat_min=49|lon_deg=114|lon_min=53|position=top|background=#FFFFFF|label=Zhangjiakou}}\n{{Location map~|China|lat_deg=39|lat_min=54|lat_sec=50|lon_deg=116|lon_min=23|lon_sec=30|position=bottom|background=#FFFFFF|mark=Green pog.svg|label=Beijing}}\n|alt=Map of China, with Zhangjiakou and Beijing marked. The cities are close together in northeast China; Zhangjiakou is slightly northwest of Beijing.}}\n\nIn the city, Wei finds the people that Zhang was supposed to be working with, only to discover that they had lost him at the train station days before. She forces another girl her age, Sun Zhimei, to help her look for Zhang at the train station, but they do not find him. Wei has no success finding Zhang through the [[public address system]] and \"missing person\" posters, so she goes to the local television station to broadcast a missing person notice. The receptionist (Feng Yuying) will not let her in without valid identification, though, and says the only way she can enter is with permission from the station manager, whom she describes as \"a man with glasses\". For the rest of the day, Wei stands by the station's only gate, stopping every man with glasses, but she does not find the station manager, and spends the night asleep on the street. The next day the station manager (Wu Wanlu) sees her at the gate again, through his window, and lets her in, scolding the receptionist for making her wait outside.\n\nAlthough Wei has no money to run an ad on TV, the station manager is interested in her story and decides to feature Wei in a talk show special about rural education. On the talk show, Wei is nervous and hardly says a word when the host (Li Fanfan) addresses her, but Zhang\u2014who has been wandering the streets begging for food\u2014sees the show. After Wei and Zhang are reunited, the station manager arranges to have them driven back to Shuiquan village, along with a truckload of school supplies and donations that viewers had sent in. Upon their return, they are greeted by the whole village. In the final scene, Wei presents the students with several boxes of colored chalk that were donated, and allows each student to write one character on the board. The film ends with a series of title cards that recount the actions of the characters after the film ends, and describe the problem of poverty in rural education in China.\n\n== Themes ==\nWhile most of Zhang's early films had been [[historical epic]]s, ''Not One Less'' was one of the first to focus on contemporary China.<ref name=\"Cardullo114\" /><ref name=\"Lu414\">{{Harvnb|Lu|2002|p=414}}.</ref> The film's main theme involves the difficulties faced in providing rural education in China. When Wei Minzhi arrives in Shuiquan village, the teacher Gao has not been paid in six months and the school building is in disrepair,<ref name=\"Zhang133\">{{Harvnb|Zhang|2001|p=133}}.</ref> and chalk is in such short supply that Gao gives Wei specific instructions limiting how large her written characters should be.<ref name=\"Kemp\" /> Wei sleeps in the school building, sharing a bed with several female students. The version of the film released overseas ends with a series of title cards in English, the last of which reads, \"Each year, poverty forces one million children in China to leave school. Through the help of donations, about 15% of these children return to school.\"\n\n[[File:Abbas-kiarostami-venice.jpg|thumb|''Not One Less'' has thematic and stylistic similarities to the work of Iranian director [[Abbas Kiarostami]].|alt=Black-and-white head portrait of an older man with short hair and sunglasses]]\nBecause the people and locations used in the film are real but are carefully selected and edited, the film creates a \"friction\"<ref name=\"Kraicer86\" /> between documentary reality and narrative fiction.
