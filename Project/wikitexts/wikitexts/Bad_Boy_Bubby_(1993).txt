The storyline follows his escape from confinement, and subsequent journey of self-discovery. The film was shot on a low budget in [[Adelaide]], and is an international co-production between Australia and Italy.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theage.com.au/entertainment/movies/italian-producer-sets-up-local-production-20020305-gdu0ra.html|title=Italian producer sets up local production|newspaper=[[The Age]]|date=5 March 2002|access-date=16 August 2017}}</ref>\n\n''Bad Boy Bubby'' premiered at the [[50th Venice International Film Festival]] on 1 September 1993, where it won the [[Special Jury Prize (Venice Film Festival)|Special Jury Prize]]. It was released in Australia the following year, and was met with positive reviews. Although it was a [[Box-office bomb|box office failure]], the film has gained a [[cult following]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/australia-culture-blog/2014/may/16/bad-boy-bubby-rewatching-classic-australian-films|title=Bad Boy Bubby: rewatching classic Australian films|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|first=Luke|last=Buckmaster|date=16 May 2014|access-date=14 November 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nIn an industrial area of [[Adelaide]], Bubby (Hope) is a mentally challenged 35-year-old man who lives in a squalid house with his abusive and [[Religious fanaticism|religious fanatic]] mother, Florence. He has never left the house, due to his mother convincing him that the air outside is toxic, and [[Jesus]] will strike him down should he leave. He and his mother regularly have [[incest]]uous sex, with his mother often encouraging Bubby to fondle her breasts. The two have no other company except for a pet cat, which Bubby accidentally kills with [[clingwrap]]. One night, Bubby's father Harold returns, having abandoned Florence years earlier to pursue a career as a preacher. Harold did not know he had a son, but he quickly comes to disdain Bubby, and mocks him for his presumed mental disorder. Harold frequently beats Bubby, and encourages Florence to do so as well. Tired of the abuse, Bubby suffocates his parents with clingwrap, and decides to venture outside for the first time.\n\nBubby is picked up by members of [[The Salvation Army]], and wanders into the town centre. However, he is socially inept, and is harassed by members of the public for his strange behaviour. He is later given a lift by a group of men who perform in a rock band, and he helps the band set up a gig. The band take a liking to Bubby, but are also unnerved by his odd actions. After reading a newspaper that reports on the murder of Bubby's parents, the band members decide to send him to stay with their friend Dan. The two go out for dinner, but Bubby fondles a woman and is arrested. He is sent to jail, but is unwilling to talk with the warden. As punishment, he sends Bubby into a separate cell, where he is raped by another inmate, \"The Animal\" (Michael Constantinou). The prison chief then deems him to be rehabilitated, and lets him go.\n\nBubby enters a church, and converses with a man there (Norman Kaye; listed in the credits as \"The Scientist\"), who tells Bubby that God does not exist, and it is the job of humans to \"think God out of existence\" and take responsibility for themselves. Bubby goes to a pub and fondles another woman, and is beaten by her friends. Overwhelmed, Bubby returns to his home as he believes that there is no place for him in the world. He dons his father's clothes and assumes the personality of \"Pop\". With newfound confidence, he returns to town and finds a stray cat, who he vows to take care of. He goes to the club where the rock band are performing, and joins them on stage, where he delivers a bizarre performance, repeating phrases he has heard from various people. His performance is a success with the crowd, and he goes back to feed the cat, but is distraught to see that it has been killed by local hoodlums. Upset, Bubby encounters a nurse named Angel, who cares for people with physical disabilities. They return to the care centre, and Bubby becomes infatuated with her breasts, as they remind him of his mother's.\n\nAngel and Bubby become lovers, and Angel invites him to have dinner with her strict and religious parents. Angel's parents humiliate her by mocking her weight, enraging Bubby, who curses at God in retaliation, before her parents demand he leave. Bubby kills Angel's parents with clingwrap, and the two continue their relationship. Bubby returns to performing with the rock band, and becomes a sensation with audiences. Finally at peace with himself, Bubby and Angel later have a child.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Nicholas Hope]] as Bubby\n* Claire Benito as Mam\n* Ralph Cotterill as Pop\n* Carmel Johnson as Angel\n* Paul Philpot as Paul (singer)\n* Mark Brouggy as Mark (roadie)\n* Todd Telford as Little Greg\n* Paul Simpson as Big Greg\n* Stephen Smooker as Middle Greg\n* Peter Monaghan as Steve\n* Rachael Huddy as herself\n\n==Production background==\nShortly after graduating from film school, Rolf de Heer collaborated with Ritchie Singer on the idea of what would eventually become ''Bad Boy Bubby''. For most of the 1980s, de Heer collected ideas and wrote them on index cards. In 1987, he took a hiatus from making ''Bubby'' index cards, but in 1989 he resumed work. In 1989 or 1990 he saw the short film ''Confessor Caressor'' starring [[Nicholas Hope]] (which would eventually be included on the bonus DVD when ''Bad Boy Bubby'' was first released on DVD in 2004) and tracked him down. In 1991, de Heer began work on the actual script.\n\nAfter he heard a rumour about the reintroduction of the death penalty to Australia, de Heer was angered and rewrote the ending so that Bubby would be executed at the end of the film. This ending was scrapped when the rumour proved false.\n\nFilming took place in [[Port Adelaide]] between 30 November 1992 and 16 January 1993.\n\nThe people with [[cerebral palsy]] Bubby meets at the 1 hour 30 minute mark are not actors, but actual disabled people. Hope, who was raised Catholic, found the scenes where Bubby curses God in front of Angel's parents difficult to film.{{Citation needed|date=November 2022}}\n\n==Audio and visual innovation==\nDirector de Heer describes the film as one large experiment, especially in the method used to record the dialogue: [[Binaural recording|binaural microphones]] were sewn into the wig worn by leading actor Nicholas Hope, one above each ear. This method gave the sound track a unique sound that closely resembled what the character would actually be hearing. The film also used 31 individual [[director of photography|directors of photography]] to shoot different scenes. Once Bubby leaves the apartment a different director of photography is used for every location until the last third of the film, allowing an individual visual slant on everything Bubby sees for the first time. No director of photography was allowed to refer to the work of the others.<ref>{{cite web | last=de Heer | first=Rolf | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080304162301/http://www.angelfire.com/movies/badboybubby/interview.htm | archive-date=4 March 2008 | url=http://www.angelfire.com/movies/badboybubby/interview.htm | title=Directors Statement \u2013 London Film Festival | year=1993 | access-date=12 April 2010 }}</ref>\n\n==Animal cruelty allegation==\nWhen the film was released in Italy, a coalition of animal rights groups tried to set up a boycott of Australian products, alleging that Bubby's pet cat was wrapped in plastic wrapping and suffocated to death on film, but Rolf de Heer has said that none of that is true; the cat scenes were carefully filmed, with a veterinarian and animal cruelty inspector on set. Nicholas Hope, in an on-stage interview included on the DVD of the film, says there were two cats, one of which became a pet of a crew member. The other was a feral cat that was put down by a vet after filming (as with most feral cats that are caught in Australia).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://aso.gov.au/titles/features/bad-boy-bubby/notes/|title=Curator's notes Bad Boy Bubby (1993) on ASO \u2013 Australia's audio and visual heritage online|website=Aso.gov.au|access-date=18 December 2021}}</ref> Film critic [[Mark Kermode]] left the screening due to the apparent animal abuse in the making of the film.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.heyuguys.com/bad-boy-bubby-a-retrospective/|title=Retrospective: Bad Boy Bubby|first=Jack|last=Hawkins|website=Heyuguys.com|date=7 May 2020|access-date=18 December 2021}}</ref>\n\n==Awards==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
