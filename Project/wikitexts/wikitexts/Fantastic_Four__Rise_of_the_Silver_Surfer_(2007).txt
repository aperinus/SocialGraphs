Both films are based on the [[Fantastic Four|''Fantastic Four'' comic book]] and were directed by [[Tim Story (film director)|Tim Story]]. The film stars [[Ioan Gruffudd]], [[Jessica Alba]], [[Chris Evans (actor)|Chris Evans]], and [[Michael Chiklis]] as the title characters, with [[Julian McMahon]], [[Kerry Washington]], [[Andre Braugher]], [[Beau Garrett]], [[Doug Jones (actor)|Doug Jones]] and [[Laurence Fishburne]] in supporting roles. The plot follows the Fantastic Four (and [[Doctor Doom]]) as they confront, and later ally with, the [[Silver Surfer]] to save Earth from [[Galactus]].\n\nThe film was released on June 15, 2007 in [[North America]]. Critical reception was generally mixed but also slightly better than the first film. The film grossed over $301 million worldwide, but earned less than its predecessor which grossed $333.5 million worldwide. A third film was planned but ultimately cancelled, which was attributed to factors such as the film's box office disappointment, the conflict between the director and Jessica Alba, and the producers having trouble finding a new director for a planned Silver Surfer spin-off. As such, the franchise even ended up in [[development hell]].<ref>{{Cite web |url= https://www.slashfilm.com/alex-proyas-kills-silver-surfer-rumor/ |title=Alex Proyas Kills Silver Surfer Rumor |website=[[slashfilm.com]] |date=24 July 2008 |access-date= December 29, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url= https://www.comicbookmovie.com/fantastic_four/fantastic_four_rise_of_the_silver_surfer/fantastic-four-rise-of-the-silver-surfer-almost-caused-jessica-alba-to-quit-acting-a25441#gs.ooyuyte |title=Fantastic Four: Rise Of The Silver Surfer Almost Caused Jessica Alba To Quit Acting! |website=comicbookmovie.com |access-date= December 29, 2020}}</ref> The series was rebooted in 2015 with the release of ''[[Fantastic Four (2015 film)|Fantastic Four]]'' to poor critical and commercial reception. Marvel Studios eventually claimed the film rights of the characters, along with the [[X-Men]] and [[Deadpool]], after [[Acquisition of 21st Century Fox by Disney|the acquisition of 21st Century Fox by Disney]].\n\n==Plot==\nA silver object enters Earth's atmosphere, radiating cosmic energy that creates massive molecular fluctuations and causes deep craters at locations across the Earth. The government approaches [[Reed Richards]] to track the movements of the object.\n\nReed and [[Invisible Woman|Susan Storm]] prepare for their wedding amidst huge media hush and publicity. As the wedding begins, Reed's systems detect the phenomenon approaching [[New York City]]. The object destroys the sensors while the [[Fantastic Four]] protect the crowd from a disabled helicopter. [[Johnny Storm]] pursues the object, finding that it is a humanoid, a \"[[Silver Surfer]]\". He confronts the Surfer, who drags Johnny into the upper atmosphere then drops him back toward Earth. Johnny manages to reactivate his powers and survives the fall, landing in a desert. Later, when Susan tries to check Johnny after he becomes weakened by the Surfer, she touches his forehead and their powers switch\u2014he becomes invisible, and she is set on fire, resulting in another humiliating public exposure for Susan; when they touch again their powers revert. Reed's examination of Johnny reveals that exposure to the Surfer has set Johnny's molecular structure in passive [[flux]], allowing him to switch powers with his teammates through physical contact.\n\nTracing the cosmic energy of the Surfer, Reed discovers that a series of planets the Surfer visited previously had all been destroyed eight days after and that he has been creating deep artificial craters around the globe for some unknown purpose. Reed determines that the next crater will appear in [[London]], and the team travels there. They arrive too late to stop the crater, and the [[River Thames|Thames]] drains into it. This also damages the [[London Eye]], but the team manage to save it from collapsing (although Johnny almost thwarts their efforts when he unintentionally switches powers with Reed). The Surfer's movements around the globe bring him past [[Latveria]], where the cosmic energy affects [[Victor Von Doom]], freeing him from two years as a bio-metal statue. Doom, able to move again but scarred, traces the Surfer to the [[Russell Glacier (Greenland)|Russell Glacier]] and makes him an offer to join forces. When the Surfer rebuffs him, Doom attacks. The Surfer returns fire, blasting Doom through the ice, though the cosmic energy of the Surfer's blast heals Doom's body instead of killing him.\n\nDoom returns and leverages his experience into a deal with the United States military, who have the Fantastic Four work with Doom reluctantly. Deducing that the Surfer's board is the source of his power, Reed develops a pulse generator that will separate him from it, while Victor works on an unknown remote-like device. In the [[Black Forest]], Susan is confronted by the Surfer, during which he reveals he is merely a servant to the destroyer of worlds and regrets the destruction he causes. The military opens fire on the Surfer, which distracts him and allows the four to fire the pulse, separating the Surfer from his board. The military imprisons the Surfer in [[Siberia]], while they torture him for information. Recalling the Surfer's words and seeing that he protected Susan from the missiles, they decide that they must speak to him behind the military's back. Susan uses her powers to sneak into his cell, where she learns his master is known on his homeworld as [[Galactus]], a cosmic entity which feeds on life-bearing planets to survive. He had to serve Galactus to prevent his world from being destroyed, and that the Surfer's board is a homing beacon leading Galactus to Earth. The reason why he tried to protect Susan is because she reminded him of his loved ones.\n\nDoom, pursuing the power in the board, steals it from the compound, using the wrist-pad device he created in secret to gain control of the board and its powers. Doom subdues several soldiers, kills General Hager and escapes to [[China]]. The Fantastic Four rescue the Surfer, and pursue Doom in the [[Fantasticar]], confronting him in [[Shanghai]]. During the showdown, Susan is impaled in the chest protecting the Surfer from a spear from Doom. With the Surfer powerless, Johnny absorbs the combined powers of the entire team in order to battle the cosmic energy-empowered Doom. Johnny succeeds in breaking Doom's device and his control over the Surfer's board, while [[Ben Grimm]] uses a nearby crane to knock Doom into the harbor. Galactus has already arrived however, and Susan dies in Reed's arms. The Surfer regains the control of his board, and his power is restored, which he uses to revive Susan and to defend Earth, flying into Galactus with help from Johnny. The conflict results in a massive blast of energy, engulfing Galactus in a cosmic rift, destroying it, and seemingly the Surfer as well. Johnny's second exposure to the Surfer heals him, and he can no longer switch his powers with his teammates.\n\nShortly after the events in Shanghai, Reed and Susan get married in [[Japan]], only to be interrupted yet again by an alert that [[Venice]] is sinking into the sea; to Reed's delight, Sue has the wedding finish quickly before they race off to save the city.\n\nIn a mid-credits scene, a shot of the Silver Surfer shows his seemingly lifeless body floating through space, until his eyes open and his board races back towards him, indicating that he is still alive.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Ioan Gruffudd]] as [[Reed Richards|Reed Richards / Mister Fantastic]]\n* [[Jessica Alba]] as [[Invisible Woman|Susan \"Sue\" Storm-Richards / Invisible Woman]]\n* [[Chris Evans (actor)|Chris Evans]] as [[Human Torch|Johnny Storm / Human Torch]]\n* [[Michael Chiklis]] as [[Thing (comics)|Ben Grimm / The Thing]]\n* [[Julian McMahon]] as Dr. [[Doctor Doom|Victor Von Doom]]\n* [[Kerry Washington]] as [[Alicia Masters]]\n* [[Andre Braugher]] as General Hager\n* [[Doug Jones (actor)|Doug Jones]] as the [[Silver Surfer]], [[Galactus]]' [[herald]] formerly known as Norrin Radd.
