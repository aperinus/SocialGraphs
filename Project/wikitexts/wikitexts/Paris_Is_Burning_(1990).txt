Contestants are judged on criteria including their dance talent, the beauty of their clothing, and the \"realness\" of their drag - i.e., their ability to pass as a member of the group or sex they are portraying. For example, the category \"[[banjee]] realness\" comprises [[gay men]] portraying [[Machismo|macho]] archetypes such as sailors, soldiers, and street hoodlums. \"Banjee boys\" are judged by their ability to pass as their [[Heterosexuality|straight]] counterparts in the outside world.\n\nMost of the film alternates between footage of balls and interviews with prominent members of the scene, including [[Pepper LaBeija]], [[Dorian Corey]], [[Angie Xtravaganza]], and [[Willi Ninja]]. Many of the contestants vying for trophies are representatives of \"[[Ball culture#Houses|houses]]\" that serve as [[Intentional community|intentional]] families, social groups, and performance teams. Houses and ball contestants who consistently win trophies for their walks eventually earn \"legendary\" status.\n\n[[Jennie Livingston]], who moved to New York after graduating from Yale to work in film, spent six years<ref>{{cite AV media |title=Interview with Jennie Livingston and the cast of ''Paris Is Burning'' |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hue8k2zzmGQ |work=[[The Joan Rivers Show]] |date=August 8, 1991 |via=[[YouTube]] |access-date=November 14, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160317215106/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hue8k2zzmGQ |archive-date=March 17, 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref> making ''Paris Is Burning'', and interviewed key figures in the ball world. Many of them contribute monologues that shed light on gender roles, gay and ball subcultures, and their own life stories. The film explains how words such as ''house'', ''mother'', ''shade'', ''reading'' and ''legendary'' gain new meaning when used in novel ways to describe the gay and drag subculture. The \"houses\" serve as surrogate families for young ball-walkers who face rejection from their biological families for their gender expression and sexual orientation.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Dena Seidel |title=An Interview with Jennie Livingston |journal= Films for the Feminist Classroom 1.1 |year=2009 |pages=1\u201316 }}</ref>\n\nThe film also explores how its subjects deal with issues such as [[AIDS]], [[racism]], [[poverty]], [[violence]] and [[homophobia]].<ref>[https://www.criterionchannel.com/paris-is-burning The Criterion Channel]</ref> Some, such as Venus Xtravaganza, become [[prostitute|sex workers]] to support themselves.

Some subjects save money for [[sex reassignment surgery]], while a few have extensive surgery; others receive [[breast implant]]s without undergoing [[vaginoplasty]].\n\nAccording to Livingston, the documentary is a multi-leveled exploration of an African-American and Latino subculture that serves as a microcosm of fame, race, and wealth in the larger US culture.<ref name=\"Koltnow\">{{cite web |last1=Koltnow |first1=Barry |title=Director says ''Paris'' isn't just dance film: Livingston wants people to look at ''Paris is Burning'' with and open mind and understanding heart |url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1991-09-04/lifestyle/9109010113_1_jennie-livingston-paris-is-burning-film |website=[[Orlando Sentinel]] |date=September 4, 1991 |access-date=November 30, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141205212415/http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1991-09-04/lifestyle/9109010113_1_jennie-livingston-paris-is-burning-film |archive-date=December 5, 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref> Through candid one-on-one interviews, the film offers insight into the lives and struggles of its subjects and the strength, pride, and humor they display to survive in a \"rich, white world.\"\n\n[[Drag (clothing)|Drag]] is presented as a complex performance of gender, class, and race, and a way to express one's identity, desires and aspirations. The African-American and Latino community depicted in the film includes a diverse range of sexual identities and gender presentations, from \"butch queens\" (gay cisgender men) to transgender women, to drag queens, to butch women.\n\nThe film also documents the origins of \"[[Vogue (dance)|voguing]]\", a dance style in which competing ball-walkers pose and freeze in glamorous positions as if being photographed for the cover of ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]''. \nHowever, Livingston maintained in 1991 that the film was not just about dance:<ref name=\"Koltnow\" /> <blockquote>This is a film that is important for anyone to see, whether they're gay or not. It's about how we're all influenced by the media; how we strive to meet the demands of the media by trying to look like ''Vogue'' models or by owning a big car. And it's about survival. It's about people who have a lot of prejudices against them and who have learned to survive with wit, dignity and energy. </blockquote>\n\n===Scenes===\n*Ball\n*Legendary\n*Categories\n*Lucious Body\n*Schoolboy/Schoolgirl realness\n*Town and country\n*Executive realness\n*Butch queen first time in drags at a ball\n*High fashion eveningwear\n*Realness\n*House\n*Mother\n*Shade\n*Reading\n*Voguing\n*Mopping\n\n==Conception and production==\nLivingston studied photography and painting at [[Yale University]]. After moving to New York, she worked for the ''[[Staten Island Advance]]'', a local newspaper. She left for one summer to study film at [[New York University]] in [[Greenwich Village]]. She was photographing in that neighborhood's [[Washington Square Park]], where she met two young men and was intrigued by their dancing and the unusual slang they were using. She asked what they were doing, and they told her that they were [[voguing]]. She attended her first ball, a mini-ball at the [[Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual & Transgender Community Center|Gay Community Center]] on 13th Street, which she filmed as an assignment for her class at NYU.\n\nAt that mini-ball, Livingston encountered [[Venus Xtravaganza]] for the first time. Later, she spent time with [[Willi Ninja]] to learn about ball culture and voguing. She also researched African-American history, literature, and culture, and she also studied queer culture and the nature of subcultures. She conducted audio interviews with several ball participants: Venus and [[Danni Xtravaganza]], [[Dorian Corey]], Junior Labeija, [[Octavia St. Laurent]] and others. The main self-funded shoot was the Paris is Burning ball in 1986.\n\nFrom that footage, Livingston worked with editor Jonathan Oppenheim to edit a trailer, which was then used to obtained funding from some grants, including awards from the [[National Endowment for the Arts]], the [[New York State Council on the Arts]], the Paul Robeson Fund, and the [[Jerome Foundation]]. Finally, Madison Davis Lacy, the head of public TV station WNYC, saw the material and contributed $125,000 to the production. The producers still needed to raise additional funds to edit the film, which came primarily from executive producer [[Nigel Finch]] at the BBC-2 show ''[[Arena (British TV series)|Arena]]''.\n\nThere was some followup production in 1989: to tell the story of voguing's entry into mainstream culture, and to tell the stories of Willi's international success as a dancer and of Venus Xtravaganza's murder, which remains unsolved to this day. The filmmakers also did an additional interview with Dorian Corey, talking about \"executive realness\", \"shade\", and \"reading\".\n\nThe documentary took seven years to complete due to production costs and difficulties obtaining funding. Livingston edited the final cut down to 78 minutes from over 75 hours of footage, all shot on expensive 16mm film. After the film's completion, the producers still needed to raise funds to get permission to use the music played in the ballrooms. It cost almost as much to clear the music as it did to shoot and edit the entire film. The production team had to rely on 10 separate funding sources throughout the course of the project.\n\n==Reception and legacy==\nThe film received overwhelmingly positive reviews from a number of mainstream and independent presses, remarkable at that time for a film on the LGBT community, given the enormous legal and cultural obstacles that they faced then. The film holds a score of 98% on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on 54 reviews, with an average rating of 7.83/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \"''Paris Is Burning'' dives into '80s transgender subculture, with the understated camera allowing this world to flourish and the people to speak (and dance) for themselves.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/paris_is_burning |title=Paris Is Burning |website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |access-date=June 30, 2020}}</ref>\n\nTerrence Rafferty of ''The New Yorker'' said the film was \"a beautiful piece of work\u2014lively, intelligent, exploratory \u2026. Everything about ''Paris Is Burning'' signifies so blatantly and so promiscuously that our formulations \u2013 our neatly paired theses and antitheses \u2013 multiply faster than we can keep track of them. What's wonderful about the picture is that Livingston is smart enough not to reduce her subjects to the sum of their possible meanings...\"\n\nFilmmaker [[Michelle Parkerson]], writing for ''The Black Film Review'', called the film \"a politically astute, historically important document of our precarious times.\u201d\n\n[[Essex Hemphill]], the poet well known for his role in [[Marlon Riggs]]\u2019s classic film ''[[Tongues Untied]]'', reviewed the film for ''[[The Guardian]]'', celebrating how the documentary created a forum for the people in it to speak in their own voices, and writing: \u201cHouses of silk and gabardine are built. Houses of dream and fantasy. Houses that bear the names of their legendary founders\u2026Houses rise and fall. Legends come and go. To pose is to reach for power while simultaneously holding real powerlessness at bay.\"\n\nYet the film was not without detractors even after its initial release.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jun/24/burning-down-the-house-debate-paris-is-burning Burning down the house: why the debate over Paris Is Burning rages on|Movies|The Guardian]</ref>\n\n[[File:Jennie Livingston.jpg|thumb|Jennie Livingston, director of ''Paris Is Burning'']]\nWriting for ''Z Magazine,'' feminist writer [[Bell Hooks|bell hooks]]{{refn|group=lower-alpha|bell hooks' name is not capitalised.

In 2003, the New York Times reported that more than two decades after its release, ''Paris Is Burning'' remains a commonly cited and frequently used organizing tool for LGBT youth; a way for scholars and students to examine issues of race, class, and gender; a way for younger ball participants to meet their cultural ancestors; and a portrait of several remarkable Americans, almost all of whom have died since the film's production.<ref>{{cite news|last=Martin|first=Douglas|date=May 26, 2003|title=Pepper LaBeija, Queen of Harlem Drag Balls, Is Dead at 53|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/05/26/obituaries/26LEBE.html|url-status=live|access-date=June 4, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140607004149/http://www.nytimes.com/2003/05/26/obituaries/26LEBE.html|archive-date=June 7, 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn 2013, UC Irvine scholar Lucas Hilderbrand wrote a history of the film, a book detailing its production, reception, and influence, ''Paris Is Burning, A Queer Film Classic'' (Arsenal Pulp Press). In 2007, writer Wesley Morris, in a print-only section for children for ''The New York Times,'' wrote \"12 Films to See Before You Turn 13\". The piece recommended kids see films like ''Princess Mononoke,'' ''The Wiz,'' and ''Do the Right Thing.''

Aware that publicity surrounding her project could result in revoked funding, Livingston avoided releasing many details about the project outside of her small circle of producers and collaborators.\n\nAlthough there had been no agreement to do so, the producers planned to distribute approximately $55,000 (1/5 of the sale price of the film to Miramax) among 13 of the participants. While Dorian Corey and Willi Ninja were very happy to be paid for a film they'd understood was an unpaid work of nonfiction, several other film participants felt they were not properly compensated and thus retained an attorney, planning to sue for a share of the film's profits in 1991. When their attorney saw they had all signed standard model releases generated by WNYC Television, they did not sue and accepted payment. Paris Dupree had planned to sue for $40 million.<ref name=\"Paris\"/>\n\nLivingston has consistently downplayed the financial controversy in interviews and forums. She has expressed that documentaries are works of nonfiction and journalism, and that it has never been standard practice to pay their subjects. She states that she paid the principals as a matter of respect at a time when this was not commonly done, and she argues that they received considerably more than they would have received if they had been actors in an independently-made drama feature.\n\nUpon its release, the documentary received exceptionally good reviews from critics and won several awards including a [[Sundance Film Festival]] [[Grand Jury Prize]], a [[Berlin International Film Festival]] [[Teddy Award|Teddy Bear]],<ref>{{cite news |last1=Warbler |first1=Daniel |title=THE OUT TAKE: 10 FANTASTIC TEDDY AWARD-WINNING LGBT FILMS TO WATCH RIGHT NOW |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/2772743/10-fantastic-teddy-award-winning-lgbt-films-to-watch-right-now/ |access-date=9 September 2018 |work=mtv.com |date=2 June 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180909221852/http://www.mtv.com/news/2772743/10-fantastic-teddy-award-winning-lgbt-films-to-watch-right-now/ |archive-date=September 9, 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref> an audience award from the [[Toronto International Film Festival]], a [[GLAAD Media Award]], a [[Women in Film Crystal + Lucy Awards|Women in Film Crystal Award]], a Best Documentary award from the [[Los Angeles Film Critics Association Award for Best Documentary Film|Los Angeles]], [[New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Documentary|New York]], and National Film Critics' Circles, and it also was named as one of 1991's best films by the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', ''[[The Washington Post]]'', [[National Public Radio]], ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine, and others.\n\nIn spite of the many positive reactions and film awards earned, ''Paris Is Burning'' did not receive an Academy Award nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature|Best Documentary Feature]] that year. This generated accusations that the [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] was homophobic and transphobic (even though it awarded such LGBT films as ''[[Common Threads: Stories from the Quilt]]'' two years prior and ''[[The Times of Harvey Milk]]''), which in turn led to changes on how documentaries are nominated for the Academy Awards.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/07/13/movies/oscar-rules-change-for-documentaries.html |title=Oscar Rules Change For Documentaries |last=Grimes |first=William |date=July 13, 1995 |work=[[The New York Times]] |access-date=February 18, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170126103246/http://www.nytimes.com/1995/07/13/movies/oscar-rules-change-for-documentaries.html |archive-date=January 26, 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[The Queen (1968 film)|''The Queen'' (1968 film)]]\n* [[Kiki (2016 film)|''Kiki'' (2016 film)]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|group=lower-alpha}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wikiquotepar|Paris is Burning}}\n* {{IMDb title}}\n* {{mojo title|parisisburning|Paris Is Burning}}\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBVBipOl76Q ''Paris Is Burning''] on [[YouTube|Youtube]]\n* [http://www.newyorker.com/arts/reviews/film/paris_is_burning_livingston From the ''New Yorker'' magazine film file]\n* [https://www.criterion.com/current/posts/6832-paris-is-burning-the-fire-this-time ''Paris Is Burning: The Fire This Time''] an essay by [[Michelle Parkerson]] at the [[Criterion Collection]]\n\n{{Navboxes\n|title = Awards for ''Paris Is Burning''\n|list =\n{{Boston Society of Film Critics Award for Best Documentary Film}}\n{{GLAAD Media Award for Outstanding Documentary}}\n{{Los Angeles Film Critics Association Award for Best Documentary Film}}\n{{National Society of Film Critics Award for Best Non-Fiction Film}}\n{{New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Non-Fiction Film}}\n{{Teddy Award for Best Documentary Film}}\n}}\n{{African-American LGBT culture}}\n{{Ball culture|state=collapsed}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Paris Is Burning (Film)}}\n[[Category:1990 films]]\n[[Category:1990 documentary films]]\n[[Category:1990 LGBT-related films]]\n[[Category:LGBT-related coming-of-age films]]\n[[Category:American independent films]]\n[[Category:American documentary films]]\n[[Category:LGBT African-American culture]]\n[[Category:American LGBT-related films]]\n[[Category:Documentary films about ball culture]]\n[[Category:Films about fashion]]\n[[Category:Documentary films about race and ethnicity in the United States]]\n[[Category:Documentary films about New York City]]\n[[Category:Films shot in New York City]]\n[[Category:Sundance Film Festival award winners]]\n[[Category:Transgender-related documentary films]]\n[[Category:Historiography of LGBT in New York City]]\n[[Category:African-American LGBT-related films]]\n[[Category:African-American films]]\n[[Category:United States National Film Registry films]]\n[[Category:Films about trans women]]\n[[Category:1990 independent films]]\n[[Category:Drag (clothing)-related films]]\n[[Category:Documentary films about dance]]\n[[Category:Films set in the 1980s]]\n[[Category:1990s English-language films]]\n[[Category:1990s American films]]"}]}}}}
