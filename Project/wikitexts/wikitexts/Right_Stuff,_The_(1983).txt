After another pilot, [[Slick Goodlin]], demands $150,000  ({{Inflation|US|150000|1947|r=-3|fmt=eq}}) to attempt to break the [[sound barrier]], war hero Captain [[Chuck Yeager]] receives the chance to fly the X-1. While on a horseback ride with his wife Glennis, Yeager collides with a tree branch and breaks his ribs, which inhibits him from leaning over and locking the door to the X-1. Worried that he might not fly the mission, Yeager confides in friend and fellow pilot [[Jack Ridley (pilot)|Jack Ridley]]. Ridley cuts off part of a broomstick and tells Yeager to use it as a lever to help seal the hatch to the X-1, and Yeager becomes the first person to fly at [[supersonic]] speed, defeating the \"demon in the sky\".\n\nSix years later, Muroc, now [[Edwards Air Force Base]], still attracts the best test pilots. Yeager (now a major) and friendly rival [[Albert Scott Crossfield|Scott Crossfield]] repeatedly break the other's speed records. They often visit the [[Happy Bottom Riding Club]] run by [[Pancho Barnes]], who classifies the pilots at Edwards as either \"prime\" (such as Yeager and Crossfield) that fly the best equipment or newer \"pudknockers\" who only dream about it. [[Gordon Cooper|Gordon \"Gordo\" Cooper]],  [[Gus Grissom|Virgil \"Gus\" Grissom]] and [[Deke Slayton|Donald \"Deke\" Slayton]], captains of the [[United States Air Force]], are among the \"pudknockers\" who hope to also prove that they have \"the Right Stuff\". The tests are no longer secret, as the military soon recognizes that it needs good publicity for funding, and with \"no bucks, no [[Buck Rogers]]\". Cooper's wife, Trudy, and other wives are afraid of becoming widows, but cannot change their husbands' ambitions and desire for success and fame.\n\nIn 1957, the launch of the Russian [[Sputnik]] satellite [[Sputnik crisis|alarms the United States government]]. Politicians such as Senator [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] and military leaders demand that [[NASA]] help America defeat the Russians in the new [[Space Race]]. The search for the first Americans in space excludes Yeager because he lacks a college degree. Grueling physical and mental tests select the [[Mercury Seven]] astronauts, including [[John Glenn]] of the [[United States Marine Corps]], [[Alan Shepard]], [[Walter Schirra]] and [[Scott Carpenter]] of the [[United States Navy]], as well as Cooper, Grissom and Slayton; they immediately become national heroes. Although many early NASA rockets explode during launch, the ambitious astronauts all hope to be the first in space as part of [[Project Mercury]]. Although engineers see the men as passengers, the pilots insist that the Mercury spacecraft have a window, a hatch with explosive bolts, and [[pitch-yaw-roll]] controls. However, Russia beats them into space on April 12, 1961 with the launch of [[Vostok 1]] carrying [[Yuri Gagarin]] into space. The seven astronauts are determined to match and surpass the Russians.\n\nShepard is the first American to reach space on the 15-minute sub-orbital flight of [[Mercury-Redstone 3]] on May 5. After Grissom's similar flight of [[Mercury-Redstone 4]] on July 21, the capsule's hatch blows open and quickly fills with water. Grissom escapes, but the spacecraft, overweight with seawater, sinks. Many criticize Grissom for possibly panicking and opening the hatch prematurely. Glenn becomes the first American to orbit the Earth on [[Mercury-Atlas 6]] on February 20, 1962, surviving a possibly loose heat shield, and receives a [[ticker-tape parade]]. He, his colleagues, and their families become celebrities, including a gigantic celebration in the [[Sam Houston Coliseum]] to announce the opening of the Manned Space Center in [[Houston]], despite Glenn's wife [[Annie Glenn|Annie]]'s fear of public speaking due to a [[stutter]].\n\nAlthough test pilots at Edwards mock the Mercury program for sending \"spam in a can\" into space, they recognize that they are no longer the fastest men on Earth, and Yeager states that \"it takes a special kind of man to volunteer for a suicide mission, especially when it's on national TV.\" While testing the new [[Lockheed NF-104A]], Yeager attempts to set a new altitude record at the edge of space but is nearly killed in a high-speed ejection when his engine fails. Though seriously burned, after reaching the ground Yeager gathers up his parachute and walks to the ambulance, proving that he still has the Right Stuff.\n\nOn May 15, 1963, Cooper has a successful launch on [[Mercury-Atlas 9]], ending the Mercury program. As the last American to fly into space alone, he \"went higher, farther, and faster than any other American ... for a brief moment, Gordo Cooper became the greatest pilot anyone had ever seen.\"\n\n==Cast==\n{{col-begin}}{{col-break}}\n* [[Sam Shepard]] as [[Chuck Yeager]], USAF\n* [[Fred Ward]] as [[Gus Grissom|Virgil I. \"Gus\" Grissom]], [[USAF]]\n* [[Dennis Quaid]] as [[Gordo Cooper|Gordon \"Gordo\" Cooper]], USAF\n* [[Ed Harris]] as [[John Glenn]], [[U.S. Marine Corps|USMC]]\n* [[Scott Glenn]] as [[Alan Shepard]], [[U.S. Navy|USN]]\n* [[Lance Henriksen]] as [[Wally Schirra|Walter \"Wally\" Schirra]], USN\n* [[Scott Paulin]] as [[Deke Slayton|Donald K. \"Deke\" Slayton]], USAF\n* [[Barbara Hershey]] as Glennis Yeager\n* [[Veronica Cartwright]] as [[Betty Grissom]]\n* [[Jane Dornacker]] as Nurse Murch\n* [[Harry Shearer]] and [[Jeff Goldblum]] as NASA recruiters sent to find astronaut candidates\n* [[Kim Stanley]] as [[Pancho Barnes]]\n* [[Pamela Reed]] as Trudy Cooper\n* [[Charles Frank]] as [[Scott Carpenter]], USN\n* [[Donald Moffat]] as U.S. Senator and Vice President [[Lyndon B.

[[Michael Ritchie (film director)|Michael Ritchie]] was originally attached but fell through; so did [[John Avildsen]] who, four years prior, had won an Oscar for his work under Winkler and Chartoff on the original ''[[Rocky]]''.

Then [[The Ladd Company]] stepped in with an estimated $17 million.\n\n===Casting===\nActor Ed Harris auditioned twice in 1981 for the role of John Glenn. Originally, Kaufman wanted to use a troupe of contortionists to portray the press corps, but settled on the improvisational comedy troupe [[Fratelli Bologna]], known for its sponsorship of \"St. Stupid's Day\" in [[San Francisco]].<ref name=\"Williams\">Williams, Christian. \"A Story that Pledges Allegiance to Drama and Entertainment.\"  ''[[Washington Post]]'', October 20, 1983, A18.</ref> The director created a locust-like chatter to accompany the press corps whenever they appear, which was achieved through a sound combination of (among other things) motorized Nikon cameras and clicking beetles.<ref name=\"Williams\" />\n\n===Filming===\nMost of the film was shot in and around San Francisco between March and October 1982, with additional filming continuing into January 1983.

He took the actors flying, studied the storyboards and special effects, and pointed out the errors. To prepare for their roles, Kaufman gave the actors playing the seven astronauts an extensive videotape collection to study.<ref name=\"Ansen\" />\n\nThe effort to make an authentic feature led to the use of many full-size aircraft, scale models and special effects to replicate the scenes at Edwards Air Force Base and [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station]].<ref>Farmer 1983, p. 47.</ref> Special visual effects supervisor Gary Gutierrez said the first special effects were too clean for the desired \"dirty, funky, early NASA look.\"<ref name=\"Ansen\" /> So Gutierrez and his team started from scratch, employing unconventional techniques, like going up a hill with model airplanes on wires and fog machines to create clouds, or shooting model F-104s from a crossbow device and capturing their flight with up to four cameras.<ref name=\"Ansen\" /> Avant garde filmmaker Jordan Belson created the background of the Earth as seen from high-flying planes and from orbiting spacecraft.<ref name=\"Wilford\" />\n\nKaufman gave his five editors a list of documentary images he needed, sending them off to search for film from NASA, the Air Force, and Bell Aircraft vaults.<ref name=\"Ansen\" /> They also discovered Russian stock footage not viewed in 30 years. During production, Kaufman met with resistance from the Ladd Company and threatened to quit several times. In December 1982, one reel of cut workprint of the film that included portions of John Glenn's flight disappeared from Kaufman's editing facility in San Francisco's Dogpatch neighborhood. The missing reel of cut workprint was never found, but was reconstructed using a black and white duplicate copy of the reel as a guide and reprinting new workprint from the original negative, which was always safely in storage at the film lab.\n\n===Historical accuracy===\nAlthough ''The Right Stuff'' was based on historic events and real people, some substantial dramatic liberties were taken. Neither Yeager's flight in the X-1 to break the sound barrier early in the film or his later, nearly fatal flight in the NF-104A were spur-of-moment, capriciously decided events, as the film seems to imply \u2013- they actually were part of the routine testing program for both aircraft. Yeager had already test-flown both aircraft a number of times previously and was very familiar with them.<ref>Young, Dr. James..

Wilmore gathered World War II era \"prop\" aircraft including:\n* [[Douglas A-26 Invader]]\n* [[North American P-51 Mustang]]\n* [[North American T-6 Texan]] and\n* [[Boeing B-29 Superfortress]]\n\nThe first group were mainly \"set dressing\" on the ramp while the [[Confederate Air Force]] (now renamed the Commemorative Air Force) B-29 [[FIFI (aircraft)|\"Fifi\"]] was modified to act as the B-29 \"mothership\" to carry the [[Bell X-1]] and [[Bell X-1#X-1A|X-1A]] rocket-powered record-breakers.<ref name=\"Farmer p. 50\u201351\">Farmer 1983, pp. 50\u201351.</ref>\n\nOther \"real\" aircraft included the early jet fighters and trainers as well as current USAF and [[United States Navy]] examples. These flying aircraft and helicopters included:\n* [[Douglas A-4 Skyhawk]]\n* [[LTV A-7 Corsair II]]\n* [[North American F-86 Sabre]]\n* [[Convair F-106 Delta Dart]]\n* [[McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II]]\n* [[Sikorsky H-34|Sikorsky H-34 Choctaw]]\n* [[Sikorsky SH-3 Sea King]]\n* [[Lockheed T-33 Shooting Star]]\n* [[Northrop T-38 Talon]]<ref>Farmer 1983, p. 51.</ref>\n\nA number of aircraft significant to the story had to be recreated. The first was an essentially static X-1 that had to at least roll along the ground and realistically \"belch flame\" by a simulated rocket blast from the exhaust pipes.<ref name=\"Farmer p.49\" /> A series of wooden mock-up X-1s were used to depict interior shots of the cockpit, the mating up of the X-1 to a modified B-29 fuselage and bomb bay and ultimately to recreate flight in a combination of model work and live-action photography. The \"follow-up\" X-1A was also an all-wooden model.<ref name=\"Farmer p. 50\u201351\" />\n\nThe U.S. Navy's [[Douglas D-558-2 Skyrocket]] that Crossfield duelled with Yeager's X-1 and X-1A was recreated from a modified [[Hawker Hunter]] jet fighter. The climactic flight of Yeager in a [[Lockheed NF-104A]] was originally to be made with a modified [[Lockheed F-104 Starfighter]] but ultimately, Wilmore decided that the production had to make do with a repainted Luftwaffe F-104G, which lacks the rocket engine of the NF-104.<ref name=\"Farmer p. 50\u201351\" />\n\nWooden mock-ups of the Mercury space capsules also realistically depicted the NASA spacecraft and were built from the original mold.<ref name=\"Wilford\" />\n\nFor many of the flying sequences, scale models were produced by USFX Studios and filmed outdoors in natural sunlight against the sky. Even off-the-shelf plastic scale models were utilized for aerial scenes. The X-1, F-104 and B-29 models were built in large numbers as a number of the more than 40 scale models were destroyed in the process of  filming.<ref>Farmer 1984, pp. 72\u201373.</ref> The blending together of miniatures, full-scale mock-ups and actual aircraft was seamlessly integrated into the live-action footage. The addition of original newsreel footage was used sparingly but to effect to provide another layer of authenticity.<ref>Farmer 1984, p. 66.</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n===Box office===\n''The Right Stuff'' had its [[Film premiere|world premiere]] on October 16, 1983, at the [[Kennedy Center]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], to benefit the [[American Film Institute]].<ref name=\"Morganthau\">Morganthau, Tom and Richard Manning. \"Glenn Meets the Dream Machine.\" ''[[Newsweek]]'', October 3, 1983, p. 36.</ref><ref name=\"Arnold\">Arnold, Gary. \"The Stuff of Dreams.\"  ''[[Washington Post]]'', October 16, 1983, p.
