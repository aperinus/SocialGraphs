The screenplay is based on ''[[The Life and Adventures of Nicholas Nickleby]]'' by [[Charles Dickens]], which originally was published in [[Serial (literature)|serial]] form between March 1838 and September 1839.  [[Charlie Hunnam]] stars in the titular role alongside [[Nathan Lane]], [[Jim Broadbent]], [[Christopher Plummer]], [[Jamie Bell]],  [[Anne Hathaway]], [[Romola Garai]], [[Alan Cumming]], and [[Timothy Spall]].\n\n==Plot==\nA [[prologue]] introduces the Nicklebys, [[country gentry]] who enjoy a comfortable life in the [[Devon]] countryside until the father dies and leaves his family with no source of income. Nineteen-year-old Nicholas, his mother, and his younger sister, Kate, venture to [[London]] to seek help from their wealthy, cold-hearted uncle Ralph, an investor who arranges for Nicholas to be hired as a [[tutor]] at Dotheboys Hall in [[Yorkshire]] and finds Kate work as a seamstress.\n\nNicholas is horrified to discover his employers, the sadistic Mr and Mrs Squeers, run their [[boarding school]] like a prison and physically, verbally, and emotionally abuse their young charges on a regular basis. He eventually rebels and escapes, taking with him the crippled young servant boy Smike. As they journey to London, they stumble upon a theatrical troupe owned and operated by Mr and Mrs Crummles. They cast them in a production of ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'', but despite a successful first night and the couple's invitation to stay, Nicholas is determined to continue their journey to London after hearing that Kate is in trouble.\n\nNicholas discovers his sister has been subjected to humiliating sexual harassment from the lecherous Sir Mulberry Hawk, a client of their uncle, who has encouraged the man to seduce his niece in the hope that she will succumb and thus cement Hawk's business relationship with him. Nicholas confronts Sir Mulberry and his uncle, renouncing the latter.\n\nNicholas is reunited with his family, who welcome Smike as one of their own, and finds clerical employment with the kindly Cheeryble brothers, who offer him more than double his previous salary. While thus employed, Nicholas makes the acquaintance of Madeline Bray, an artist who financially supports both herself and her tyrannical father, as her father gambled away his fortune and that of his late wife.\n\nNicholas' determination to defend his sister's honour leads his uncle to vow he will destroy the young man. What ensues is a series of adventures in which the upstanding Nicholas manages to survive the schemes of his evil uncle, including an attempt to return Smike to Squeers by kidnapping him and an effort to abort Nicholas' growing relationship with Madeline by promising her father he will excuse his debts if the girl weds Hawk. Ralph's designs on Madeline are thwarted when her father dies unexpectedly. Unfortunately, Smike falls ill and soon dies. Soon after, a sinister secret Ralph has harbored for years surfaces, and it is revealed Smike was Ralph's son, whom he had thought dead. Realizing that his son had died the best friend of his most hated enemy, Ralph hangs himself. Kate marries the Cheeryble brothers' nephew Frank, while Nicholas marries Madeline and settles with her in Devon at his father's house and grounds, where Smike is buried.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Charlie Hunnam]] as Nicholas Nickleby\n* [[Nathan Lane]] as Vincent Crummles\n* [[Jim Broadbent]] as Wackford Squeers\n* [[Christopher Plummer]] as Ralph Nickleby\n* [[Jamie Bell]] as Smike\n* [[Anne Hathaway]] as Madeline Bray\n* [[Alan Cumming]] as Mr. Folair\n* [[Timothy Spall]] as Charles Cheeryble\n* [[Tom Courtenay]] as Newman Noggs, Ralph Nickleby's factotum\n* [[Juliet Stevenson]] as Mrs. Squeers\n* [[Romola Garai]] as Kate Nickleby\n* [[Stella Gonet]] as Catherine Nickleby\n* [[Heather Goldenhersh]] as Fanny Squeers\n* [[Barry Humphries]] as Mrs. Crummles\n* [[Gerard Horan]] as Ned Cheeryble\n* [[William Ash (actor)|William Ash]] as Frank Cheeryble\n* [[Edward Fox (actor)|Edward Fox]] as Sir Mulberry Hawk\n* [[David Bradley (English actor)|David Bradley]] as Mr. Nigel Bray\n* [[Phil Davis (actor)|Phil Davis]] as Brooker\n* [[Kevin McKidd]] as John Browdie\n* [[Nicholas Rowe (actor)|Nicholas Rowe]] as Lord Verisopht\n* [[Sophie Thompson]] as Miss Lacreevy\n* [[Andrew Havill]] as Mr. Nickleby\n* [[Angus Wright (actor)|Angus Wright]] as Mr Pluck\n{{Div col end}}\n\n==Production==\nIn ''Creating a Classic: The Making of Nicholas Nickleby'', a bonus feature on the film's DVD release, screenwriter/director Douglas McGrath and his cast and crew discuss the development of the project. The positive audience reaction to a stage reading of the screenplay in a theater in lower [[Manhattan]], which included a number of actors who eventually were cast in the film, convinced McGrath to proceed with the movie. At the request of [[production designer]] Eve Stewart, he advanced the time frame from the 1830s to the 1850s so she could incorporate elements of the [[Industrial Revolution]] into her design plans.\n\n[[Jamie Bell]]'s audition for the role of Smike in a London hotel room left McGrath and the producers in tears, and they cast him on the spot. While considering Mrs. Crummles, a smug, opinionated, but lovable [[dowager]], McGrath realized all her traits and characteristics were embodied by [[Dame Edna Everage]], [[alter ego]] of actor [[Barry Humphries]], but was hesitant to suggest casting a male in the role. The producers, however, agreed Humphries was an ideal choice. Nicholas was one of the last roles to be cast. [[Charlie Hunnam]] had been sent the script, but several months passed before he had an opportunity to read it. He met with McGrath, and based on a couple of hours of conversation with the actor, the director felt he finally had found the right man for the part. Ironically, the British Hunnam had to work with a dialect coach; having lived and worked in the US for the past several years, he had perfected an American accent in order to ensure regular employment.\n\nCostume designer [[Ruth Myers (costume designer)|Ruth Myers]] opted to dress two of the leading characters in clothing pre-dating the period in which the film is set in order to suggest Nicholas, as the newly anointed head of his family, wore clothing inherited from his father, and the impoverished Madeline's dresses were [[Used good|hand-me-downs]] from her mother.\n\nLocations used in the film included the abandoned 19th century Gibson Mill in [[Hardcastle Crags]]; [[Hebden Bridge]] in [[West Yorkshire]]; [[Churchill College]] at the [[University of Cambridge]]; and [[Wilton's Music Hall]], the [[Old Vic]], and the [[Reform Club]] in London. Interiors were filmed in [[Elstree Studios (Shenley Road)|Elstree Studios]] in [[Borehamwood]] and [[Three Mills|Three Mills Studios]] in the [[East End of London]].\n\n==Release==\n===Critical response===\nThe film received positive reviews from critics. Review aggregator [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reports that 78% out of 126 professional critics gave the film a positive review, with a rating average of 6.8/10 and the critical consensus being: \"Thanks to a strong cast of experienced actors and director Douglas McGrath's steady hand, ''Nicholas Nickleby'' is a worthy and respectful adaptation of the Dickens novel.\"<ref>[http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1119037-nicholas_nickleby/ Nicholas Nickeleby (2002)]. ''Rotten Tomatoes''. [[Flixster]]. Retrieved 25 June 2020.</ref>\n\nIn his review in ''[[The New York Times]]'', [[A. O. Scott]] called the film \"two hours of swift, engaging entertainment\" and added, \"The book's theme and spirit have been dutifully respected. No, what Mr. McGrath has done with admirable modesty is better than that. Rather than trying to update, transform or otherwise interpret ''Nickleby'', he has decided to share his enthusiasm for it ... [He] has adapted [Dickens' dialogue] with a scholar's ear and a showman's flair ... [and] produced a colorful, affecting collage of Dickensian moods and motifs, a movie that elicits an overwhelming desire to plunge into 900 pages of 19th-century prose.\"<ref>{{cite news |first=A.

But in the new movie, writer-director Douglas McGrath manages to tell it all in 132 minutes, without the story ever seeming rushed or curtailed. Instead, the impression is one of abundance: It's a generous tale, told through big performances by a talented cast.\"<ref>{{cite news |first=Mick |last=LaSalle |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2003/01/03/DD150599.DTL |title=The Dickens, you say/ 'Nickleby' film is faithful to classic novel's emotional scope |newspaper=San Francisco Chronicle |date=3 January 2003 |access-date=29 December 2019}}</ref>\n\n[[Peter Travers]] of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' awarded the film three out of a possible four stars and commented, \"Christopher Plummer steals the show without resorting to [[Camp (style)|camp]] as Nicholas' wounded and wounding Uncle Ralph. It's a great performance and a reminder of Dickens' grandeur. This [[CliffsNotes]] of a film, though lively fun, only hints at that. No matter.

The sacrifices of condensing Dickens' massive novel to standard feature length are discernible, especially in the title character's discovery of love. But while it's told in conventional fashion, the heart of this tale of a young man's quest to rescue his family from villainy and misfortune is lovingly rendered by a mostly superlative cast and with an entertaining balance of humor and pathos . . . McGrath's approach is old-fashioned but appealing, using a [[novelist]]ic style that relies on [[voiceover]] to get through much of the initial exposition. His script captures the scope, humor and compassion of Dickens' novel and drives the picaresque story along at a lively clip.\"<ref>{{cite news |last=Rooney |first=David |url=https://variety.com/2002/film/awards/nicholas-nickleby-2-1200544309/ |title=Nicholas Nickleby |newspaper=Variety |date=17 December 2002 |access-date=29 December 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Box office===\nThe film grossed $1,587,173 in the U.S. and $2,064,289 in foreign markets for a total worldwide box office of $3,651,462.<ref name=\"mojo\">{{cite web |url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=nicholasnickleby.htm |title=Nicholas Nickleby |website=[[Box Office Mojo]] |access-date=2012-12-19}}</ref>\n\n==Awards and nominations==\nThe film was nominated for the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture - Musical or Comedy]].
