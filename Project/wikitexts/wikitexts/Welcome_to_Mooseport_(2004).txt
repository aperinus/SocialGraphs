It was filmed in [[Jackson's Point, Ontario]] and [[Port Perry, Ontario]].\n\n==Plot==\nFormer [[President of the United States]] Monroe \"Eagle\" Cole [[Retirement|retires]] to his vacation home in the town of Mooseport, [[Maine]], to escape from his ex-wife Charlotte. Harold \"Handy\" Harrison is the town's local hardware store owner and plumber. Harrison's job keeps him so busy that he has neglected his relationship with girlfriend (and the town veternarian) Sally Mannis, who is on the verge of dumping him.\n\nAfter the death of the town mayor, the [[town council]] decides to approach former president Cole about running for the office. Cole agrees because, if he is mayor, his Mooseport house can serve as his office and, therefore, can no longer be divided up or sold off in his [[divorce]] settlement. As a surprise to Cole, Harison's name has also been entered into the race. When Harrison finds out Cole is running, he decides to withdraw, until he witnesses Cole make a pass at Sally. Handy believes that, by becoming mayor, he can show Sally he is a mature decision maker and win back her heart.\n\nTempers rise following the arrival of Cole's ex-wife and campaign spoiler Charlotte. Cole's team, led by long-time executive secretary Grace Sutherland and presidential aide Will Bullard, bring in strong support in the form of campaign strategist Bert Langdon, who is looking for excitement since Cole's retirement. As the campaigns progress, Cole and Harrison both become obsessed with winning the race at all costs, although Harrison refuses to resort to cheating. Cole realizes that in all his years of campaigning this may be his toughest as he is taking on a genuinely honest [[everyman]].\n\nOn the night before the election, both candidates urge the voters to vote for the other candidate by saying that neither of them will vote for themselves. Harrison keeps his promise, but Cole votes for himself. Upon the revelation that Cole won by one vote, his conscience gets the better of him and he concedes the match to Harrison. However, Harrison lies that he voted for himself as well, and declines office, making Cole end up as mayor. Harrison later reveals to Sally that he conceded the election because Cole needs the mayorship more than he does and that all he really wanted was to propose marriage to her, which he does. As Handy is proposing to Sally, Monroe also proposes to Grace. The film ends with Bert Langdon telling Handy that he ran an excellent campaign and offers to be his campaign manager for [[Governor of Maine]], which Handy shows some interest in when he realizes a governor has certain authority over mayors.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Ray Romano]] as Harold \"Handy\" Harrison\n* [[Gene Hackman]] as Monroe \"Eagle\" Cole\n* [[Marcia Gay Harden]] as Grace Sutherland\n* [[Maura Tierney]] as Dr. Sally Mannis\n* [[Fred Savage]] as Will Bullard\n* [[Rip Torn]] as Bert Langdon\n* [[Christine Baranski]] as Charlotte Cole\n* [[Wayne Robson]] as Morris Gutman\n* [[Reagan Pasternak]] as Mandy Gutman\n* [[June Squibb]] as Irma\n* [[John Rothman]] as Stu\n* [[Jayne Eastwood]] as Lucy Decker\n* [[Juan \"Chi-Chi\" Rodriguez]] as himself\n* Richard Romano as Handy's bar buddy\n* [[Jon Manfrellotti]] as Reporter\n* [[Edward Herrmann]] (''uncredited'') as Avery Hightower\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Reception==\n===Box office===\nThe film opened theatrically on February 20, 2004, in 2,868 venues, earning $6,775,132 and ranking fourth in the domestic box office.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/weekend/chart/?yr=2004&wknd=08&p=.htm | title=Weekend Box Office Results for February 20-22, 2004 | publisher=Box Office Mojo | date=February 23, 2004 | access-date=January 21, 2016}}</ref> The film ended its run twelve weeks later on May 13, 2004, having grossed $14,470,947 domestically and $144,152 overseas, for a worldwide total of $14,615,099.

He's supposed to be overshadowed by his nemesis, of course, but Hackman chews him up and spits him out so effectively that the movie is glaringly lopsided.\"<ref>{{cite web |first=William |last=Arnold | url=http://www.seattlepi.com/ae/movies/article/Hackman-shreds-Romano-s-performance-in-cheesy-1137408.php | title=Hackman shreds Romano's performance in cheesy 'Mooseport' | work=[[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]] |date=February 20, 2004 | access-date=October 13, 2017}}</ref> [[Roger Ebert]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' awarded the film three out of four stars, writing: \"Whether the movie works or not depends on the charm of the actors. Hackman could charm the chrome off a trailer hitch. Romano is more of the earnest, aw-shucks, sincere, well-meaning kind of guy whose charm is inner and only peeks out occasionally. They work well together here, and Tierney does a heroic job of playing a character who doesn't know how the story will end, when everybody else, in the cast and in the audience, has an excellent idea.\"<ref>{{cite web |first=Roger |last=Ebert | url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/welcome-to-mooseport-2004 | title=Welcome to Mooseport  | work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]] | access-date=October 13, 2017}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|0361925|Welcome to Mooseport}}\n* {{Mojo title|welcometomooseport|Welcome to Mooseport}}\n* {{Rotten Tomatoes|welcome_to_mooseport|Welcome to Mooseport}}\n* {{Metacritic film|title=Welcome to Mooseport}}\n* Raymond Romano {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929095527/http://www.moviehole.net/news/20040209_3153.html |date=September 29, 2007 |title=interview for Welcome To Mooseport }}<!-- should be moved into main article as a reference --> archived from [http://www.moviehole.net/news/20040209_3153.html the original] at Moviehole.net\n\n{{Donald Petrie}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Welcome To Mooseport}}\n[[Category:2004 films]]\n[[Category:2004 romantic comedy films]]\n[[Category:2000s political comedy films]]\n[[Category:2000s satirical films]]\n[[Category:English-language German films]]\n[[Category:2000s English-language films]]\n[[Category:20th Century Fox films]]\n[[Category:American political comedy films]]\n[[Category:American romantic comedy films]]\n[[Category:German romantic comedy films]]\n[[Category:Films scored by John Debney]]\n[[Category:Films about elections]]\n[[Category:Films about fictional presidents of the United States]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Donald Petrie]]\n[[Category:Films set in Maine]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Los Angeles]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Toronto]]\n[[Category:Films produced by Basil Iwanyk]]\n[[Category:American political satire films]]\n[[Category:German political satire films]]\n[[Category:2000s American films]]\n[[Category:2000s German films]]"}]}}}}
