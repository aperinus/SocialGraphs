It stars [[Tom Cavanagh]], [[Ben Foster (actor)|Ben Foster]], [[Randy Harrison]], and [[Janel Moloney]]. Based on Mastrosimone's [[Bang Bang You're Dead (play)|1999 play of the same name]], the film is not a direct adaptation; it follows a troubled high school student played by Foster who participates in his school's production of the play while attempting to avoid going down the same path as the play's lead character.\n\nThe film premiered at the [[Seattle International Film Festival]] in June 2002.<ref>[http://www.cavalierdaily.com/article/2010/04/bang-bang-youre-dead/ Bang Bang co director Interview]</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n16-year-old Trevor Adams ([[Ben Foster (actor)|Ben Foster]]) attends an [[United States|American]] high school where he is one of the outcasts harassed and humiliated by the school's [[jock (stereotype)|jocks]]. He made a false threat to bomb the school a few months ago, narrowly escaping expulsion. Since then, Trevor has been trying to fit back in to normal high school life. He joined a theater group and has been chosen to star in a school play about school shootings called ''Bang Bang You're Dead'' as the main character, Josh. After parents and the community hear of the play and its lead actor, they call for it to be canceled.\n\nBut Trevor's theater activity, alone, is not sufficient to let off the steam of his boiling resentment. Using his video camera, he has been documenting bullying at school, creating a \"diary of violence\".\n\nTrevor and his friends Sean, Mark and Kurt, make plans to storm the school with guns and kill as many of the hated athletes as possible. Trevor meets Jenny, also 16, who stays by him and stands up for him. Through her, Trevor begins to doubt whether the act he plans is right.\n\nIn the end, he is the only one to realize that bloodshed only fuels more violence and hatred, and evacuates the school with his art teacher, Mr. Duncan ([[Tom Cavanagh]]). At the last minute, Trevor prevents bloodshed by overwhelming Kurt, Sean and Mark.\n\nThe film ends with the play premiering successfully, despite the initial protests of the students' parents.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n*[[Tom Cavanagh]] as Mr. Val Duncan\n*[[Ben Foster (actor)|Ben Foster]] as Trevor Adams\n*[[Randy Harrison]] as Sean\n*[[Janel Moloney]] as Ellie Milford\n*[[Jane McGregor]] as Jenny Dahlquist\n*[[David Paetkau]] as Brad Larkin\n*[[Garry Chalk]] as Chief Bud McGee\n*[[Eric Johnson (actor)|Eric Johnson]] as Mark Kentworth\n*[[Kristian Ayre]] as Kurt\n* Brent Glenen as Zach\n*[[Gillian Barber]] as Principal Meyer\n*[[Eric Keenleyside]] as Bob Adams\n*Glynis Davies as Karen Adams\n*Fred Henderson as Dan Dahlquist\n*P.
