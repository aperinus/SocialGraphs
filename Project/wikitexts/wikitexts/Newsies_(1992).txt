Redford]], it stars [[Christian Bale]], [[Bill Pullman]], [[Ann-Margret]] and [[Robert Duvall]].\n\nThe film was an initial [[Box-office bomb|box office bomb]], and received negative-to-mixed reviews at the time of its release. However, it later gained a [[cult following]] on home video,<ref name=\"culturalfanbase\">{{cite web|last=Collis|first=Clark|date=August 31, 2007|title=Spotlight on Christian Bale|url=http://ew.com/article/2007/08/31/spotlight-christian-bale/|access-date=March 19, 2018|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|publisher=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]}}</ref> and was ultimately adapted into a [[Newsies (musical)|stage musical]] on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]]. The play was nominated for eight [[Tony Awards]], winning two including [[Tony Award for Best Original Score|Best Original Score]] for Menken and Feldman.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1899, 17-year-old Jack \"Cowboy\" Kelly is one of many struggling [[newspaper hawker]]s in New York City, selling copies of the ''[[New York World]]'' on the streets of [[Manhattan]] (\"Carrying the Banner\"). When David Jacobs and his younger brother Les join the \"newsies,\" Jack notices David's intelligence and Les's marketable cuteness and self-servingly takes them under his wing. Unlike most of the newsies, David and Les are not orphans or runaways; they have a home and family, and go to work in order to help their family get back on their feet financially, as their father was fired from his factory job due to an injury. Jack is invited to the Jacobs' home for dinner, where he becomes enamored with their sister Sarah. Later, Jack laments his isolation due to lacking a family of his own; he fantasizes about traveling to [[New Mexico]], about which he has heard many romantic stories (\"Santa Fe\"). \n \nAttempting to outdo his business rival [[William Randolph Hearst]], ''New York World'' publisher [[Joseph Pulitzer]] raises the prices that the newsies must pay to buy newspapers from his distribution centers. Angered, Jack and David galvanize the other Manhattan newsies to go on [[strike action|strike]] (\"The World Will Know\"). While the others spread the word to newsies in [[Boroughs of New York City|New York's other boroughs]], Jack and Les confront Pulitzer and are thrown out of his office. Bryan Denton, a reporter for ''[[The Sun (New York City)|The Sun]]'', takes an interest in the boys' story. Jack and David take their cause to the [[Brooklyn]] newsies, but their leader, \"Spot\" Conlon, is reluctant to join the strike. This dejects the Manhattan newsies, but David riles them up (\"Seize the Day\"). As a result, they ambush the distribution center and destroy all of the newspapers. Disabled newsie \"Crutchie\" is captured by Pulitzer's enforcers, the Delancey brothers, and placed in an [[orphanage]] and [[juvenile detention center]] called the Refuge, run by the sketchy Warden Snyder, who neglects the orphans so that he can embezzle money given to him by the city for their care.\n\nThe newsies try to ward off [[strikebreaker]]s, but the struggle turns violent and turns out to be a trap set by the Delancey brothers. Just as the newsies are about to be arrested, Spot Conlon arrives with the Brooklyn newsies and the two groups unite to repel the police. Denton puts the story on the front page of ''The Sun''. Thrilled, the newsies all rejoice at making the headline and imagine what it would be like to be famous (\"King of New York\"). They then plan to hold a rally. Snyder informs Pulitzer that Jack is an escapee from the Refuge, giving Pulitzer legal cause to have him arrested. Jack has breakfast with Sarah on the roof of the Jacobs' apartment building; he tells her of his desire to flee to Santa Fe, and wonders if she would miss him.\n\nNewsies from around New York gather at Medda Larkin's Bowery. Jack, David, and Spot give speeches, encouraging the newsies to stick together and not give up on their cause. Before they all go back to their own boroughs, Medda cheers them up with a song (\"High Times, Hard Times\"). The police then break up the rally and arrest the newsies, but Denton steps in to pay their legal fines. Snyder testifies against Jack and reveals to the others that Jack's real name is Francis Sullivan; his mother is deceased and his father incarcerated. Jack is sentenced to four years of rehabilitation in the Refuge. Denton is reassigned as a [[war correspondent]] and can no longer report on the strike. Jack is taken to see Pulitzer, who offers to waive his sentence and pay him a salary if he will work as a strikebreaker. When Pulitzer threatens to have the other newsies thrown into the Refuge, Jack complies. The boys attempt to rescue Jack, but he tells them to leave.\n\nThe newsies are shocked and dismayed to see Jack report for work the next day. When the Delanceys attack the Jacobs children, Jack steps in to save them, despite knowing this will break his deal with Pulitzer. The newsies learn from Denton that their strike has had little effect on public opinion, since the city thrives on [[child labor]] and Pulitzer has ordered newspapers not to report on the strike. Using an old printing press of Pulitzer's, they publish a \"Newsie Banner\" which they distribute to child workers citywide (\"Once and For All\"). Denton shares the paper with Governor [[Theodore Roosevelt]], exposing the mistreatment of children at the Refuge. Numerous child laborers join the strike, bringing the city's workforce to a standstill. Jack and David confront Pulitzer, who finally gives in to their demands.\n\nRoosevelt has Snyder arrested, releases the children from the Refuge, and thanks Jack for alerting him to the situation. He offers Jack a ride, and Jack asks to be taken to the train yards so he can head to Santa Fe. The newsies are disheartened by this, but Jack returns shortly, having been convinced by Roosevelt that he still has things to accomplish in New York. As the newsies celebrate his return, Sarah and Jack kiss, and Spot gets a ride back to Brooklyn from Roosevelt.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Christian Bale]] as Jack \"Cowboy\" Kelly / Francis Sullivan\n* [[David Moscow]] as David Jacobs\n* Dominic Lucero as Bumlets\n* Luke Edwards as Les Jacobs \n* [[Bill Pullman]] as Bryan Denton\n* [[Robert Duvall]] as [[Joseph Pulitzer]]\n* [[Ann-Margret]] as Medda Larkson\n* [[Ele Keats]] as Sarah Jacobs\n* [[Aaron Lohr]] as \"Mush\" Meyers\n* [[Max Casella]] as \"Racetrack\" Higgins\n* Trey Parker as \"Kid Blink\" {{efn|Not to be confused with the ''[[South Park]]'' co-creator [[Trey Parker|of the same name]]}}<ref>{{cite web |title=Teen Beat 1993 |url=https://a-pair-of-new-shoes.tumblr.com/post/93894795784/teen-beat-1993-newsies-interviews |website=Newsies |access-date=21 January 2020}}</ref>\n* [[Michael A.

Kid Blink is featured in the film as a minor supporting character, while the role of strike leader is given to the fictional Jack \"Cowboy\" Kelly.
