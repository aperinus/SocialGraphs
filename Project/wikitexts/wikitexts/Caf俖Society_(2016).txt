His elder sister Evelyn is a married school teacher, while his elder brother Ben is a gangster. Discontented with working for his father, a jeweler, Bobby decides to move to Hollywood, where he takes a job running menial errands for his uncle Phil, a powerhouse talent agent.\n\nPhil introduces Bobby to his secretary Veronica, nicknamed Vonnie, who is tasked with helping Bobby settle into Hollywood. Bobby is drawn to her unpretentiousness as opposed to most young women living in Hollywood, and falls deeply in love with her. She rebuffs his advances, telling him she has a journalist boyfriend named Doug. In reality, \"Doug\" is Phil, with whom Vonnie is carrying on an illicit romance; he promises to divorce his wife and marry her.\n\nOn the [[Wedding anniversary|first-year \"paper anniversary\"]] of their affair, Vonnie gives Phil a letter written and signed by [[Rudolph Valentino]] as a gift. However, Phil proceeds to tell her that he is incapable of divorcing his wife, so he ends the affair. Vonnie subsequently surrenders to Bobby's love for her and their friendship turns into a romance.\n\nA forlorn Phil confides in Bobby about his affair\u2014without naming his mistress\u2014before telling him he has determined to divorce his wife. Bobby passingly mentions his relationship with Vonnie and his intention to marry her and return to New York. Phil begins petitioning Vonnie privately to leave Bobby and marry him instead.\n\nWhile having a conversation with Phil in his office, Bobby notices the Valentino letter. Recognizing it from Vonnie's account about her breakup with \"Doug\", he confronts her and asks her to choose between himself and Phil. Vonnie chooses Phil.\n\nA heartbroken Bobby returns to New York City where he begins to run a high-end nightclub with his gangster brother, Ben. It soon becomes a famous hangout for the rich and powerful, from politicians to gangsters. Bobby meets divorc\u00e9e Veronica Hayes at the nightclub, and they begin dating, soon getting married and starting a family together.\n\nOn an extended visit to New York, a happily married Phil and Vonnie stop at the nightclub and insist on seeing Bobby. Vonnie has become a pretentious name-dropper and Bobby is at first repulsed by her. However, he agrees to show her around New York\u2014as she had once done for him in Hollywood. They spend an evening without Phil, visiting Bobby's favorite haunts and, as dawn breaks over [[Central Park]], share a kiss; but it's clear that it can go no further.\n\nBobby's sister Evelyn asks their brother, Ben, to \"talk to\" her disagreeable neighbor; Ben promptly kills him. He is arrested and convicted for murder and racketeering. Shortly before he goes to the electric chair, he converts to [[Christianity]], mortifying his parents. His late brother's notoriety propels the nightclub to new heights, and Bobby travels to [[Los Angeles]] to contemplate opening a Hollywood version. He ultimately decides against it, but, before he leaves, he and Vonnie have lunch together, where she mentions that she and Phil will be returning to New York for a short visit. However, they both decide that it is better if they don't see each other.\n\nMonths later, on New Year's Eve, Bobby and Vonnie are apart\u2014Bobby in New York City hosting festivities in his nightclub, and Vonnie with her husband at a Hollywood house party. As the new year is rung in, they both seem distant to their spouses, and both have a faraway look in their eyes.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{cast list|\n* [[Jesse Eisenberg]] as Bobby Dorfman\n* [[Kristen Stewart]] as Veronica \"Vonnie\" Sybil\n* [[Steve Carell]] as Phil Stern\n* [[Blake Lively]] as Veronica Hayes\n* [[Parker Posey]] as Rad Taylor\n* [[Corey Stoll]] as Ben Dorfman\n* [[Jeannie Berlin]] as Rose Dorfman\n* [[Ken Stott]] as Marty Dorfman\n* [[Anna Camp]] as Candy\n* [[Paul Schneider (actor)|Paul Schneider]] as Steve\n* [[Sheryl Lee]] as Karen Stern\n* [[Tony Sirico]] as Vito\n* [[Stephen Kunken]] as Leonard\n* [[Sari Lennick]] as Evelyn Dorfman\n* [[Laurel Griggs]] as Evelyn Dorfman's daughter\n* [[Max Adler (actor)|Max Adler]] as Walt\n* [[Don Stark]] as Sol\n* [[Gregg Binkley]] as Mike\n* [[Woody Allen]] (uncredited) as Narrator (voice) <ref>{{cite news |first=Stephen |last=Galloway |date=May 4, 2016 |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/features/woody-allen-interview-he-wont-889678 |title=The Woody Allen Interview (Which He Won't Read) |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |access-date=May 4, 2016 |archive-date=May 6, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180506034902/https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/features/woody-allen-interview-he-wont-889678 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n}}\n\n== Production ==\nBy March 9, 2015, [[Jesse Eisenberg]], [[Bruce Willis]] and [[Kristen Stewart]] were added to the cast of the [[Woody Allen]] film, which was produced by [[Letty Aronson]], [[Stephen Tenenbaum]] and Edward Walson.<ref name=Mar2015Deadline>{{cite news|last=Fleming|first=Mike Jr.|title=Jesse Eisenberg, Bruce Willis, Kristen Stewart To Star in Next Woody Allen Pic|url=https://deadline.com/2015/03/jesse-eisenberg-bruce-willis-kristen-stewart-woody-allen-1201388945/|access-date=July 25, 2015|publisher=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|date=March 9, 2015| archive-date= August 14, 2015| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150814023515/http://deadline.com/2015/03/jesse-eisenberg-bruce-willis-kristen-stewart-woody-allen-1201388945/ | url-status=live}}</ref> On May 6, 2015, [[Blake Lively]] was cast,<ref name=May2015TW>{{cite news|last=Emery|first=Debbie|title=Blake Lively Joins Cast of Woody Allen's Next Film|url=https://www.thewrap.com/blake-lively-set-to-join-cast-of-woody-allens-next-film/|access-date=July 25, 2015|publisher=[[TheWrap.com]]|date=May 6, 2015 | archive-date= July 26, 2015 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150726201547/http://www.thewrap.com/blake-lively-set-to-join-cast-of-woody-allens-next-film/ | url-status=live}}</ref> followed by [[Parker Posey]] in mid-July.<ref name=July2015Deadline>{{cite news|last1=Busch|first1=Anita|last2=Fleming Jr|first2=Mike|title=Parker Posey To Reteam With Woody Allen on Next Film|url=https://deadline.com/2015/07/parker-posey-reteam-with-woody-allen-on-next-untitled-film-1201477649/|access-date=July 25, 2015|publisher=Deadline.com|date=July 16, 2015 | archive-date = August 9, 2015 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150809233427/http://deadline.com/2015/07/parker-posey-reteam-with-woody-allen-on-next-untitled-film-1201477649/ | url-status=live}}</ref> By August 4, 2015, more cast was added, including [[Jeannie Berlin]], [[Corey Stoll]] and [[Ken Stott]], along with [[Anna Camp]], [[Stephen Kunken]], [[Sari Lennick]] and [[Paul Schneider (actor)|Paul Schneider]].<ref name=Aug2015Deadline>{{cite news|last=Siegel|first=Tatiana|title=Woody Allen Announces Cast for New Film|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/woody-allen-new-film-cast-813011|access-date=August 5, 2015|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=August 4, 2015 | archive-date=August 22, 2015 | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20150822202353/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/woody-allen-new-film-cast-813011| url-status=live}}</ref> In August, [[Tony Sirico]] was cast<ref name=SiricoCast>{{cite news|last=Pedersen|first=Erik|title=Tony Sirico Joins Woody Allen's Latest; Meagen Fay Tunes Up For 'La La Land'|url=https://deadline.com/2015/08/tony-sirico-joins-woody-allenmovie-meagen-fay-cast-in-la-la-land-1201496699/|access-date=August 11, 2015 | publisher = Deadline.com|date=August 10, 2015 | archive-date=August 11, 2015 | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20150811182456/http://deadline.com/2015/08/tony-sirico-joins-woody-allenmovie-meagen-fay-cast-in-la-la-land-1201496699/| url-status=live}}</ref> and [[Max Adler (actor)|Max Adler]] had also joined the cast.<ref name=AdlerCast>{{cite news|last=A.

It's a young man's tale of woe rendered with an old man's aversion to dawdling over what can't be helped, over questions of human nature that have long been settled to everyone's dissatisfaction. The worldview is weary, and Allen narrates in a voice that, for the first time, suggests his 80 years of age. But his touch lightens with each film, and the melancholy bubbles up from below and catches you off guard.\"<ref>David Edelstein. \"Woody Allen returns to Old Hollywood in Cafe Society.\" ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]''.

But just when you are about to dismiss the picture as pure cappuccino froth, the bittersweet bite kicks in.

In other words, it\u2019s a format Allen has relied upon many times before, but even past the age of 80, the still-fertile writer-director, amazingly sticking to his one-film-per-year rhythm (not to mention his upcoming TV series, also with Amazon), has created a small fiction of amiable appeal and vibrancy which goes down as easily as a fizzy cocktail.\"<ref>{{cite web |last1=McCarthy |first1=Todd |title='Cafe Society': Cannes Review |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/cafe-society-cannes-review-892693 |website=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |access-date=2 April 2021 |language=en |date=11 May 2016 |archive-date=April 13, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210413074635/https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/cafe-society-cannes-review-892693 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{official website}}\n* {{Mojo title|cafesociety}}\n* {{Rotten Tomatoes|m/cafe_society_2016}}[https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/cafe_society_2016 ]\n* {{IMDb title|4513674}}\n\n{{Woody Allen}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Cafe Society (film)}}\n[[Category:2016 films]]\n[[Category:2016 romantic comedy-drama films]]\n[[Category:Amazon Studios films]]\n[[Category:American romantic comedy-drama films]]\n[[Category:2010s English-language films]]\n[[Category:FilmNation Entertainment films]]\n[[Category:Films about Hollywood, Los Angeles]]\n[[Category:Films about Jews and Judaism]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Woody Allen]]\n[[Category:Films produced by Letty Aronson]]\n[[Category:Films produced by Stephen Tenenbaum]]\n[[Category:Films set in the 1930s]]\n[[Category:Films set in Los Angeles]]\n[[Category:Films set in New York City]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Los Angeles]]\n[[Category:Films shot in New York City]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by Woody Allen]]\n[[Category:2016 comedy films]]\n[[Category:2016 drama films]]\n[[Category:2010s American films]]"}]}}}}
