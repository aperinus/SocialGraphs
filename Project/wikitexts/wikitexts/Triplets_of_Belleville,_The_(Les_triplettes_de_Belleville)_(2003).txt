It was released as '''''Belleville Rendez-vous''''' in the United Kingdom. The film is Chomet's first feature film and was an [[international co-production]] among companies in France, Belgium, Canada and the United Kingdom.\n\nThe film features the voices of Lina Boudreault, Mari-Lou Gauthier, Mich\u00e8le Caucheteux, Jean-Claude Donda, [[Michel Robin]], and Monica Viegas. There is little dialogue; much of the narrative is conveyed through song and [[pantomime]]. It tells the story of Madame Souza, an elderly woman who goes on a quest to rescue her grandson Champion, a [[Tour de France]] cyclist, who has been kidnapped by the French mafia for gambling purposes and taken to the city of Belleville (an amalgam of [[Paris]], [[New York City]], [[Montreal]] and [[Quebec City]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sfgate.com/entertainment/article/For-caricaturist-Chomet-creator-of-Triplets-of-2524759.php|title=For caricaturist Chomet, creator of 'Triplets of Belleville,' it's a long way from Disney|last=Curiel|first=Jonathan|work=[[San Francisco Chronicle|SFGate]]|date=2003-12-29|access-date=2015-02-09}}</ref>). She is accompanied by Champion's loyal and obese hound, Bruno, and joined by the Triplets of Belleville, [[music hall]] singers from the 1930s, whom she meets in the city.\n\nThe film was highly praised by audiences and critics for its unique style of animation. The film was nominated for two [[Academy Awards]]\u2014[[Academy Award for Best Animated Feature|Best Animated Feature]] and [[Academy Award for Best Original Song|Best Original Song]] for \"[[Belleville Rendez-vous (song)|Belleville Rendez-vous]]\". It was also screened out of competition (''hors concours'') at the [[2003 Cannes Film Festival]].<ref name=\"festival-cannes.com\">{{cite web |url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/4075513/year/2003.html |title=Festival de Cannes: The Triplets of Belleville |access-date=2009-11-09|work=festival-cannes.com}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nIn France, Madame Souza raises her grandson Champion, a melancholy orphan. Both watch an old variety show on television featuring a trio of singers, the Triplets of Belleville (Rose, Violette, and Blanche). When the program is interrupted, Souza asks Champion if the \"film\" is finished. The listless Champion does not reply and instead changes the channel to a piano concert. Souza, upon noticing Champion's interest in the music, pulls out an old piano and tries to attract Champion's attention by playing a scale, but Champion remains indifferent. Souza deduces that Champion is lonely and buys him a dog, Bruno. Neither Bruno nor an electric train set succeed in lifting Champion's spirits.\n\nWhile tidying Champion's room, Souza discovers a book filled with photos of cyclists. She decides to buy Champion a [[tricycle]], which finally allows Champion to indulge in his passion. After a few years of training, Champion competes in the [[Tour de France]], but finds himself left behind in his exhaustion, and he is kidnapped by a pair of [[Milieu (organized crime in France)|mobsters]], who take him and two other contestants across the Atlantic. Souza pursues Champion on a [[pedalo]] to Belleville.\n\nArriving in the United States, Souza finds herself penniless, but meets the elderly Triplets of Belleville, Rose, Violette and Blanche. The Triplets take Souza into their apartment, and after a peculiar dinner, they allow her to participate as a musician in one of their shows. During the show, Souza spots the mobsters who kidnapped Champion. With the help of the Triplets, Souza pursues the men and rescues her grandson after a Homeric chase. In a [[flashforward]], an older Champion watches the TV again showing their adventure when they are leaving the city and imagines Souza asking once more if the film is finished. Champion turns to the empty couch seat next to him and says \"It's over, grandma\".\n\nIn a humorous post-credits scene, the boatman who rented Souza the pedalo is seen waiting expectantly for his vessel to return.\n\n==Reception==\n[[Rotten Tomatoes]], a [[review aggregator]], reports that {{RT data|score}} of {{RT data|count}} surveyed critics gave it a positive review, and the average rating was {{RT data|average}}; the consensus reads: \"Richly detailed and loaded with surreal touches, ''The Triplets of Belleville'' is an odd, delightful charmer.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_triplets_of_belleville|title=The Triplets of Belleville (2003)|website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|publisher=[[Fandango Media|Fandango]]|access-date={{RT data|access date|df=iso}}}}{{RT data|edit}}</ref> [[Metacritic]], which assigns a normalized score, rated it 91/100 based on 35 reviews, indicating \"universal acclaim\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-triplets-of-belleville|title=The Triplets of Belleville|work=[[Metacritic]]|access-date=2014-04-19}}</ref>\n\n===Awards===\nThe film was nominated for two [[Academy Awards]]: for [[Academy Award for Best Animated Feature|Best Animated Feature]], making it the first PG-13 animated film to be nominated in that category; and for [[Academy Award for Best Original Song|Best Original Song]] ([[Beno\u00eet Charest]] and Sylvain Chomet for the song \"[[Belleville Rendez-vous (song)|Belleville Rendez-vous]]\", sung by [[Matthieu Chedid]] in the original version).
