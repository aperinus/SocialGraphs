(song)|title song]] by [[Burt Bacharach]] (music) and [[Hal David]] (lyrics) is sung by [[Tom Jones (singer)|Tom Jones]]. The film poster was painted by [[Frank Frazetta]], and the animated title sequence was directed by [[Richard Williams (animator)|Richard Williams]].\n\nThe expression \"what's new pussycat?\" arose in the [[beatnik]] generation and is a general query aimed by men at women. In the film, Michael (O'Toole) calls all women \"Pussycat\" to avoid having to remember their names.\n\n==Plot==\nNotorious womanizer Michael James ([[Peter O'Toole|Peter O' Toole]]) wants to be faithful to his fianc\u00e9e Carole Werner ([[Romy Schneider]]), but every woman he meets seems to fall in love with him, including neurotic exotic dancer Liz Bien ([[Paula Prentiss]]) and parachutist Rita ([[Ursula Andress]]), who accidentally lands in his car. His [[psychoanalysis|psychoanalyst]], Dr. Fritz Fassbender ([[Peter Sellers]]), cannot help, since he is [[stalking]] patient Ren\u00e9e Lefebvre ([[Capucine]]), who in turn longs for Michael. Carole, meanwhile, decides to make Michael jealous by flirting with his nervous wreck of a friend, Victor Shakapopulis ([[Woody Allen]]). Victor struggles to be romantic but Carole nevertheless feigns interest.\n\nFassbender continues to have group meetings with his neurotics and obsessives and cannot understand why everyone falls for Michael. The group sessions get stranger\u2014including an indoor [[cricket]] match. Michael dreams that all his sexual conquests simultaneously bombard him for attention, listing where they made love.\n\nFassbender goes to the [[River Seine]] and fills a rowing boat with [[kerosene]] and wraps himself in the [[Norwegian flag]] - preparing to commit suicide in the style of a [[Viking funeral]]. Victor appears and sets up a small dining table nearby and asks what he is doing. Distracted, Fassbender forgets his idea of suicide and starts giving Victor advice. Despite his attempts to womanise, Fassbender is revealed to be married with three children.\n\nMeanwhile, Carole's plan seems to work and Michael asks to marry her. She agrees and they settle on marrying within the week. She moves in but Michael finds fidelity impossible. \n\nWhen a second \"fiancee\" arrives, she knows the worst. Simultaneously, a woman parachutes into Michael's open-top sports car and he ends up sleeping with her, also meeting other conquests at the bar. This takes place at a small country hotel, where all parties materialise in the format of a typical [[Farce|French farce]]. Some are checked in, but most just appear. This includes Carole's parents who wander the corridors, causing Michael to jump from room to room. A rumour has also started locally that an orgy is taking place so side characters such as the petrol station attendant also start to appear. Carole appears and wishes to see Michael's room. As they speak, all the other participants chase each other around in the background. Fassbender's wife tracks him down.\n\nEveryone ends in Michael's room with most of the females half-naked. The police arrive and form a line. Anna\u2014Dr. Fassbender's wife, played by [[Eddra Gale]]\u2014charges in operatic Valkyrie costume, complete with a spear. They all escape to a [[go-kart]] circuit. They leave the circuit and go first to a farmyard then through narrow village streets still on the go-karts then back to the circuit.\n\nAfter a mayor marries Michael and Carole in a civil marriage ceremony, the couple are signing the marriage certificate when Michael calls the young female [[General Register Office|registrar]] \"Pussycat\", infuriating Carole. They leave and Fassbender attempts to court her instead.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Peter Sellers]] as Dr. Fritz Fassbender\n* [[Peter O'Toole]] as Michael James\n* [[Romy Schneider]] as Carole Werner \n* [[Capucine]] as Ren\u00e9e Lefebvre\n* [[Paula Prentiss]] as Liz Bien\n* [[Woody Allen]] as Victor Shakapopulis\n* [[Ursula Andress]] as Rita, the parachutist\n* [[Michel Subor]] as Philippe\n* [[Eddra Gale]] as Dr. Fassbender's wife, Anna\n* Katrin Schaake as Jacqueline\n* El\u00e9onore Hirt as Carole's mother, Mrs. Sylvia Werner\n* Jean Par\u00e9d\u00e8s as Marcel, Ren\u00e9e's husband\n* [[Jacques Balutin]] as Etienne\n* [[Jess Hahn]] as Mr. Werner, Carole's father\n* [[Howard Vernon]] as Doctor\n* [[Fran\u00e7oise Hardy]] as Mayor's assistant (the registrar)\n* Sabine Sun as Nurse\n* Nicole Karen as Tempest\n* Jacqueline Fogt as Charlotte\n* [[Daniel Emilfork]] as Gas Station Man\n* [[Tanya Lopert]] as Miss Lewis\n{{div col end}}\n\n===Cast notes===\n* [[Richard Burton]] has a cameo appearance as a man at the bar in a strip club.\n\n==Production==\n[[Warren Beatty]] wanted to make a comedy film about male [[sex addiction]] and hoped [[Charles Feldman]] would produce it. The title ''What's New Pussycat?'' was taken from Beatty's phone salutation when speaking to his female friends. Beatty desired a role for his then girlfriend, the actress [[Leslie Caron]], but Feldman wanted a different actress.<ref>{{cite magazine|first=Chris|last=Nashawaty|title=Warren Beatty: An oral history of the elusive icon's six decades in Hollywood|url=http://www.ew.com/article/2016/11/22/warren-beatty-oral-history-six-decades-hollywood|magazine=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|location=New York City|date=November 22, 2016}}</ref>\n\nBeatty and Feldman sought a joke writer and, after seeing him perform in a New York club, Feldman offered [[Woody Allen]] $30,000. Allen accepted provided he could also appear in the film. As Allen worked on the script, his first screenplay, Beatty noticed that Allen's role was continually growing at the expense of his own.<ref name=\"Biskind2011\">{{cite book|first=Peter|last=Biskind|author-link=Peter Biskind|title=Easy Riders Raging Bulls: How the Sex-Drugs-And Rock 'N Roll Generation Save|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J3ucTdpeE9YC&pg=PA25|date=December 13, 2011|publisher=[[Simon and Schuster]]|location=New York City|isbn=978-1-4391-2661-5|pages=25\u201326}}</ref>\n\nEventually, Beatty threatened to quit the production to stop this erosion, but the actor's status in Hollywood at that time had declined so severely that Feldman decided to let him leave and gave the part to [[Peter O'Toole]]. Beatty later said \"I diva'ed my way out of the movie. I walked off of ''What's New, Pussycat?'' thinking they couldn't do it without me. I was wrong\".<ref name=\"Harris2009\"/> According to Beatty, a new screenwriter was brought in and Allen's role was pared back to a minor character.<ref name=\"Harris2009\">{{cite book|first=Mark|last= Harris|title=Scenes from a Revolution: The Birth of the New Hollywood|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=O7JI1xprXkMC&pg=PA86|date=2009|publisher=Canongate Books|location=Edinburgh|isbn=978-1-84767-121-9|page=86}}</ref>\n\n[[Groucho Marx]] was to have played Dr. Fassbender, but at O'Toole's insistence he was replaced by [[Peter Sellers]]. O'Toole, Sellers and director [[Clive Donner]] all made changes to the script, straining their relationship with Allen. Tension was also generated by Sellers' demanding top billing, but O'Toole described the atmosphere as stimulating.<ref name=\"Sellers2015\">{{cite book|first=Robert|last=Sellers|title=Peter O'Toole: The Definitive Biography|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IT14BwAAQBAJ&pg=PT109|publisher=[[Pan Macmillan]]|location=Basingstoke|date=September 10, 2015|isbn=978-0-283-07216-1|page=109}}</ref>\n\nSecond unit director [[Richard Talmadge]] is credited with creating the ''karting sequence''. The film was shot in and around [[Paris]] between October 1964 and January 1965 and released in New York on 22 June 1965. It opened in Paris in January 1966 as ''Quoi de neuf, Pussycat?'' The total box office take was $18,820,000.<ref name=box/>\n\nIn addition to the title theme, songs featured were \"Here I Am\" by [[Dionne Warwick]] and \"[[My Little Red Book]]\" performed by [[Manfred Mann]].\n\n==Homage==\nThe scene by the River Seine in which the lovelorn Dr.  Fassbender plans to commit suicide and Victor's intrusion inhibiting him from doing so pays tribute to the [[Charlie Chaplin]] film ''[[City Lights]]'' (1931), in which the Little Tramp saves a [[dipsomania]]cal millionaire bent on self-destruction.{{cn|date=September 2022}}\n\n==Reception==\nThe film received mixed reviews. [[Bosley Crowther]] in ''[[The New York Times]]'' gave the film a negative review. He criticised the script, the directing and the acting and described the film as \"the most outrageously cluttered and campy, noisy and neurotic display of what is evidently intended as way-out slapstick\". He praised the scenery and title song.<ref>{{cite news| first=Bosley|last=Crowther|author-link=Bosley Crowther|url=https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=940DE2DD173BE13ABC4B51DFB066838E679EDE?| title=The Screen: 'What's New Pussycat?':Wild Comedy Arrives at Two Theaters|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]| date=June 23, 1965| access-date=August 16, 2016}}</ref> On the other hand, [[Andrew Sarris]] in ''[[The Village Voice]]'' wrote: \"I have now seen ''What's New Pussycat?'' four times, and each time I find new nuances in the direction, the writing, the playing, and, above all, the music. This is one movie that is not what it seems at first glance. It has been attacked for tastelessness, and yet I have never seen a more tasteful sex comedy.\"<ref>{{cite news|first=Andrew|last=Sarris| url=https://criticsroundup.com/film/whats-new-pussycat/| title=The Village Voice: Andrew Sarris| newspaper=[[The Village Voice]]|location=New York City|date=August 5, 1965| access-date=March 15, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Awards and nominations==\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n!

The author was renowned crime and western novelist [[Marvin Albert|Marvin H. Albert]], who also made something of a cottage industry out of movie tie-ins. A fecund writer, he seems also to have been the most prolific American screenplay novelizer of the late '50s through mid '60s, and, during that time, the preeminent specialist at light comedy.\n\n==Sequel==\nThe 1970 American movie ''[[Pussycat, Pussycat, I Love You]]'' was intended as a sequel to this film, and includes much of the same premise of a young man (played by [[Ian McShane]]) visiting his psychiatrist to discuss his love-life.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Sister project links|auto=yes}}\n* {{IMDb title|0059903}}\n* {{AllMovie title|54091}}\n* {{Rotten Tomatoes|whats_new_pussycat}}\n* {{TCMDb title|95451}}\n\n<!--spacing, please do not remove-->\n{{Clive Donner}}\n\n[[Category:1965 films]]\n[[Category:1965 romantic comedy films]]\n[[Category:1960s English-language films]]\n[[Category:1960s screwball comedy films]]\n[[Category:1960s sex comedy films]]\n[[Category:American romantic comedy films]]\n[[Category:American screwball comedy films]]\n[[Category:American sex comedy films]]\n[[Category:American slapstick comedy films]]\n[[Category:English-language French films]]\n[[Category:Films about psychiatry]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Clive Donner]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Burt Bacharach]]\n[[Category:Films set in hotels]]\n[[Category:Films set in Paris]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Paris]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by Woody Allen]]\n[[Category:French romantic comedy films]]\n[[Category:French sex comedy films]]\n[[Category:United Artists films]]\n[[Category:1960s American films]]\n[[Category:1960s French films]]"}]}}}}
