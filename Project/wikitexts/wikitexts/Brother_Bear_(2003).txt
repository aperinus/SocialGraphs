It is the 44th [[List of Walt Disney Animation Studios films|Disney animated feature film]]. In the film, an [[Alaska native]] boy named Kenai pursues a bear and kills it, but the Spirits, incensed by this unnecessary death, change Kenai into a bear himself as punishment.<ref name=\"Lenburg 2009\">{{cite book|last=Lenburg|first=Jeff|title=The Encyclopedia of Animated Cartoons Third Edition|year=2009|publisher=Infobase Publishing|isbn=978-0-8160-6599-8}}</ref> In order to be human again, Kenai must travel to a mountain where the Northern lights touch the earth. \n\nThe film was the third and final [[List of Disney theatrical animated features|Disney animated feature]] produced primarily by the Feature Animation studio at [[Disney's Hollywood Studios|Disney-MGM Studios]] in [[Orlando, Florida]]; the studio was shut down in March 2004, not long after the release of this film in favor of computer animated features. The film received mixed to negative reviews from critics and received a nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Animated Feature|Best Animated Feature]] at the [[76th Academy Awards]], losing to [[Pixar|Pixar's]] ''[[Finding Nemo]]''. The film grossed $250 million against a $46 million budget. A [[direct-to-video]] sequel, ''[[Brother Bear 2]]'', was released on August 29, 2006.\n\n==Plot==\nIn a post-[[glacial period|ice age]] [[Alaska]], the local [[Alaska Natives|tribes]] believe all creatures are created through the Great [[Spirit guide|Spirits]], who are said to appear in the form of an [[aurora]]. A trio of brothers, Kenai, the youngest; Denahi, the middle; and Sitka, the eldest, return to their tribe in order for Kenai to receive his [[totems|totem]], necklaces in the shapes of different animals. The particular animals they represent symbolize what they must achieve to call themselves men. Unlike Sitka, who gained the eagle of guidance, and Denahi, who gained the wolf of wisdom, Kenai receives the bear of love. He objects to his totem, stating that bears are thieves, and believes his point is made a fact when a [[brown bear]] steals their basket of salmon. Kenai and his brothers pursue the bear, but a fight ends on top of a glacier, during which Sitka gives his life to save his brothers by dislodging the glacier, although the bear survives the fall. After Sitka's funeral, an enraged Kenai blames the bear for Sitka's death. He hunts down and chases the bear up onto a rocky cliff, fighting and eventually slaying it. The Spirits, represented by Sitka's spirit in the form of a [[bald eagle]], arrive and transform Kenai into a bear after the dead bear's body evaporates and joins them. Denahi arrives and, falsely believing that Kenai was killed by the bear from earlier, vows to avenge Kenai by hunting it down.\n\nKenai falls down some rapids, survives, and is healed by Tanana, the shaman of his tribe. She does not speak the bear language, but advises him to return to the mountain to find Sitka and be turned back to a human, but only when he atones for his actions; she vanishes without an explanation. Kenai quickly discovers that the wildlife can now speak to him, meeting a pair of [[moose]] brothers named Rutt and Tuke. He gets caught in a trap, but is freed by an outgoing bear cub named Koda. They make a deal: Kenai will escort Koda to an annual [[salmon run]] and then the cub will lead Kenai to the mountain. As the two eventually form a brother-like relationship, Koda reveals that his mother is missing. The two are hunted by Denahi, who is still determined to avenge Kenai, unaware that the bear he is pursuing is actually Kenai himself. Eventually, Kenai and Koda reach the salmon run, where a large number of bears live as a family, including the leader Tug. Kenai accepts his new surroundings and is comfortable living with the other bears. During a discussion among the bears, Koda tells a story about his mother recently fighting human hunters on a glacier, reminding Kenai of his and his brothers' fight with the bear that led to Sitka's death, making him realize that the entire time, the bear he killed was Koda's mother. \n\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Brother Bear 09.jpg|230px|thumb|left|Kenai's contentment is about to be shattered when Koda tells the story of his separation from his mother<br/>{{ffdc|1=Brother Bear 09.jpg|log=2015 May 22}}]] -->\nHorrified of what he has done, Kenai runs away in a fit of guilt, but Koda soon follows him. Downhearted, Kenai confesses the truth to Koda, who runs away, grief-stricken that Kenai was responsible for his mother's death out of avenging Sitka. An apologetic Kenai leaves to reach the mountain. Meanwhile, Rutt and Tuke, having had a falling-out, reconcile in front of Koda, prompting him to forgive Kenai. On the mountain, Kenai is cornered by Denahi, but their battle is interrupted by Koda, who steals Denahi's spear. Kenai sacrifices himself for Koda, out of love, prompting Sitka to appear and turn him back into a human, much to Denahi and Koda's surprise. However, upon realizing that Koda needs him because of his own mistake, Kenai asks Sitka to transform him back into a bear with Denahi's support. Sitka complies, and Kenai is transformed back into a bear. Koda is reunited briefly with the spirit of his mother before she and Sitka return to the spirit world. In the end, Kenai lives with the rest of the bears and gains his title as a man, through being a bear.\n\n==Voice cast==\n* [[Joaquin Phoenix]] as Kenai, the younger brother of Sitka and Denahi.

Children and their parents are likely to relate on completely different levels, the adults connecting with the transfer of souls from man to beast, while the kids are excited by the adventure stuff.\"<ref name=\"Brother Bear (2003)\">{{cite web|title=Brother Bear (2003)|last=Ebert|first=Roger|url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/brother-bear-2003|work=Chicago Sun-Times|via=[[RogerEbert.com]]|date=October 31, 2003|access-date=May 30, 2014}}</ref> ''[[USA Today]]'' film critic [[Claudia Puig]] gave the film three out of four stars praising the film for its \"message of tolerance and respect for nature rings loud and clear.

He later wrote: \"This opulent movie, with gorgeous rainbow animation, is heavy on message but light on humor.\"<ref>{{cite news |last=Holden |first=Stephen |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/10/24/movies/film-review-to-a-grizzly-humans-are-the-hairy-monsters.html |title=FILM REVIEW; To a Grizzly, Humans Are the Hairy Monsters |work=The New York Times |date=October 24, 2003 |access-date=January 13, 2022}}</ref> \n\nMany critics and audiences also noted the use of the film's [[Aspect ratio (image)|aspect ratio]] as a storytelling device. The film begins at a standard widescreen aspect ratio of 1.75:1 (similar to the 1.85:1 ratio common in [[Cinema of the United States|U.S. cinema]] or the 1.78:1 ratio of [[High-definition television|HDTV]]), while Kenai is a human; in addition, the film's art direction and color scheme are grounded in realism. After Kenai transforms into a bear twenty-four minutes into the picture, the film itself transforms as well: to an [[anamorphic]] aspect ratio of 2.35:1 and towards brighter, more fanciful colors and slightly more [[caricature]]d art direction. ''Brother Bear'' was the first feature since ''[[The Horse Whisperer (film)|The Horse Whisperer]]'' to do a widescreen shift. It was the only animated film to feature this technique, until ''[[The Simpsons Movie]]'' and ''[[Enchanted (2007 film)|Enchanted]]'' in 2007.\n\n===Box office===\nIn its limited release, ''Brother Bear'' played only in two selected theaters in [[Los Angeles, California]] and [[New York City]], grossing $291,940 for a per-screen average of $145,970.<ref>{{cite news|title=Nothing Scary About Brother Bear's Roaring Start|url=http://www.awn.com/news/nothing-scary-about-brother-bears-roaring-start|last=Desowitz|first=Bill|work=Animation World Magazine|date=October 27, 2003|access-date=July 6, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|title=Scary Movin'|url=http://www.ew.com/article/2003/11/07/scary-movin|magazine=Entertainment Weekly|date=November 7, 2003|access-date=July 6, 2015}}</ref> The wide release followed on November 1, 2003 expanding to 3,030 theater venues.

For the parade, the song had slightly changed lyrics and was performed by an ensemble.\n\n===Cancelled television spin-off and sequel===\n[[Disney Television Animation]] was set to produce a television series titled ''Brother Bear: The Series'' for [[Disney Channel]]. ''[[The Simpsons]]'' veteran Pete Michels was to helm the series and was allowed to watch a copy of the film so that he could construct a pilot. The series would have taken place directly after the events of the film and would have seen Kenai and Koda adopt other orphaned animals into their family. [[Jeremy Suarez]], [[Rick Moranis]] and [[Dave Thomas (actor)|Dave Thomas]] were to reprise their respective roles while [[Will Friedle]] would have replaced [[Joaquin Phoenix]] as Kenai. While the pilot tested well, it was not picked up as Disney Channel executives felt that adapting the film as a series was \"counterproductive\" to their goal of trying to reach a tween audience, combined with the fact that the movie performed below expectations.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://animatedviews.com/2013/o-brother-bear-where-art-thou-why-disney-channel-turned-down-brother-bear-the-series/|title=O Brother Bear, Where Art Thou?: Why Disney Channel turned down Brother Bear: The Series|website=Animated Views|last=Armstrong|first=Josh|date=November 26, 2013|access-date=December 24, 2021}}</ref>\n\nA direct-to-video sequel called ''[[Brother Bear 2]]'' was released on August 29, 2006. It focuses on the continued adventures of bear brothers Kenai and Koda. While the first film dealt with Kenai's relationship with Koda, this one focuses more on his bond with a young human of his past, Nita.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Disney|Film|Animation}}\n*[[List of Disney theatrical animated features]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|3}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Wikiquote}}\n* {{Official website|http://movies.disney.com/brother-bear}}\n* {{IMDb title|0328880}}\n* {{Amg movie|282032}}\n* {{Bcdb title|23326}}\n* {{Rotten-tomatoes|brother_bear}}\n* {{Metacritic film}}\n* {{Mojo title|brotherbear}}\n* [http://www.bbear.org/ Brother Bear Online Archive]\n\n{{Brother Bear}}\n{{Disney theatrical animated features}}\n{{Walt Disney Animation Studios}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Brother Bear]]\n[[Category:2003 animated films]]\n[[Category:2003 films]]\n[[Category:2003 directorial debut films]]\n[[Category:2000s American animated films]]\n[[Category:2000s buddy films]]\n[[Category:2000s musical comedy-drama films]]\n[[Category:2000s musical fantasy films]]\n[[Category:2000s English-language films]]\n[[Category:American buddy films]]\n[[Category:Films about Inuit in Canada]]\n[[Category:American children's animated comedy films]]\n[[Category:American children's animated drama films]]\n[[Category:American children's animated fantasy films]]\n[[Category:American comedy-drama films]]\n[[Category:American children's animated musical films]]\n[[Category:American coming-of-age films]]\n[[Category:American musical fantasy films]]\n[[Category:Animated buddy films]]\n[[Category:American musical drama films]]\n[[Category:Animated coming-of-age films]]\n[[Category:Animated films about animals]]\n[[Category:Animated drama films]]\n[[Category:Animated films set in prehistory]]\n[[Category:Buddy comedy films]]\n[[Category:Children's comedy-drama films]]\n[[Category:Films about animal rights]]\n[[Category:Animated films about bears]]\n[[Category:Films about shapeshifting]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Aaron Blaise]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Robert Walker (animator)]]\n[[Category:Films set in Alaska]]\n[[Category:Inuktitut-language films]]\n[[Category:Musicals by Phil Collins]]\n[[Category:Walt Disney Animation Studios films]]\n[[Category:Walt Disney Pictures films]]\n[[Category:Films about brothers]]\n[[Category:2000s children's animated films]]\n[[Category:Inuit films]]\n[[Category:2003 comedy films]]\n[[Category:2003 drama films]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by Tab Murphy]]\n[[Category:Animated films about brothers]]"}]}}}}
