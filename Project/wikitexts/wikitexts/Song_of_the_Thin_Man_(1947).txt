The sixth and final film in [[MGM]]'s ''[[The Thin Man (film)|Thin Man]]'' series, starring [[William Powell]] and [[Myrna Loy]] as [[Nick and Nora Charles]], characters created by [[Dashiell Hammett]]. Nick Jr. is played by [[Dean Stockwell]]. [[Phillip Reed]], [[Keenan Wynn]], [[Gloria Grahame]], and [[Jayne Meadows]] are featured in this story set in the world of nightclub musicians.\n\n==Plot==\nA charity benefit sponsored by David Thayar is staged aboard the S.S. ''Fortune'', Phil Brant's gambling ship. The entertainment is provided by a jazz band led by Tommy Drake and featuring singer Fran Page and talented but unstable clarinetist Buddy Hollis.\n\nAfter a set, Drake informs a displeased Brant that he is quitting, having gotten a much better booking through Mitchell Talbin. However, Drake has a problem: he owes gangster Al Amboy $12,000. When Amboy (who is at the party) hears the news, he demands full payment that night. Drake begs Talbin to give him an advance, but Talbin is unwilling to part with such a large sum. In desperation, Drake sneaks into Brant's office and opens the safe, when he is shot from behind and killed.\n\nBrant and socialite Janet Thayar elope, as her father David disapproves of Brant's lower-class background. The next morning, they show up at Nick and Nora Charles's apartment, having learned that Brant is the prime suspect in the murder. When a bullet narrowly misses Brant, Nick turns him in to the police, having decided it is safer for all concerned. Then Nick starts investigating.\n\nSneaking aboard the ''Fortune'', Nick discovers on the back of a sheet of music a receipt signed by Amboy acknowledging that Drake's debt had been paid. Nick then runs into Drake's band, allowed back on board to collect their instruments. When he questions them, he learns that the bandleader had many enemies, among them Buddy Hollis. Musician Clarence \"Clinker\" Krause agrees to help Nick track Buddy down, but they have no luck.\n\nNick and Nora visit a hostile Janet. The bullet that killed Drake likely came from an antique gun, and Nick knows Janet's father is an avid collector. Nick finds that one gun is missing from Mr. Thayar's collection. Janet leaves after getting a telephone call. Nick and Nora follow her to Fran's apartment where they find Fran's body, recently stabbed in the back. Janet claims Fran called to sell her some information, but that she arrived after Fran was killed.\n\nNick finds a matchbook from a hotel in [[Poughkeepsie, New York|Poughkeepsie]] that eventually leads him to a sanitarium where Buddy is undergoing treatment. The musician is too badly shaken to answer Nick's questions, though Nora's presence seems to calm him down. When Nora sneaks back later by herself, Buddy becomes agitated, confesses to the murder, pulls out the antique gun, and tries to shoot Nora but misses. Nick does not believe the deranged man's confession as Drake was slain by a well-aimed shot.\n\nNick gathers all the suspects by arranging a party on the reopened ''Fortune'' and announces that Buddy has fully recovered and that he will reveal the murderer's identity that night. It is Nora who notices the crucial clue: Amboy's wife shows up wearing a valuable necklace that matches the earrings owned by Mitchell Talbin's wife, Phyllis. Sometime later, the necklace mysteriously reappears on Phyllis's neck. When Nick confronts Mitchell, Phyllis reveals that it was she who paid off her lover Drake's debt using the necklace. As Nick prompts Buddy to finger the killer, Mitchell confesses to both killings and pulls out a gun. An enraged Phyllis shoots him first, but her husband is only wounded. Despite Nick's pleas to desist, she fires repeatedly, finishing the job.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[William Powell]] as Nick Charles\n* [[Myrna Loy]] as Nora Charles\n* [[Keenan Wynn]] as Clarence \"Clinker\" Krause\n* [[Dean Stockwell]] as Nick Charles Jr. \n* [[Phillip Reed]] as Tommy Edlon Drake (as Philip Reed)\n* [[Patricia Morison]] as Phyllis Talbin\n* [[Leon Ames]] as Mitchell Talbin\n* [[Gloria Grahame]] as Fran Ledue Page (singing voice was dubbed by Carol Arden)\n* [[Jayne Meadows]] as Janet Thayar\n* [[Ralph Morgan]] as David I.
