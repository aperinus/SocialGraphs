When you listen to it, in the film, it looks very simple but in reality it\u2019s a piece of almost 1h30 that keeps evolving in a subtle way. I only use the first five minutes. I could have made a Canada Dry music that imitates Philip Glass but it would have been much less inspired.\n\nI listened to Philip Glass\u2019s entire discography. I was looking for the perfect thing and I fell in love with it. Given its duration, the idea at the beginning was to use several passages of the song, especially since we had managed to negotiate the rights with the publishers. But during the assembly I realized that if we do not have the start, the track is incomprehensible.\n\nThis way of using the first five minutes of the song creates an impression of endless loop, it becomes almost distressing. There is never a climax, we always come back to the same point. I came to this conclusion very quickly, on the set, even before thinking of Philip Glass. I did not want to do a BO, to accompany the film with small musical intentions as we usually do. You needed one piece of music that keeps coming back.<ref name=\"Cinezik\"/>|[[Quentin Dupieux]]}}\n\n==Reception==\n===Critical reception===\nOn review aggregator [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film holds an approval rating of 64% based on 25 reviews, with an average rating of 6.13/10.<ref>{{cite web|title=Reality (R\u00e9alit\u00e9) (2015) - Rotten Tomatoes|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/reality_2015|website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|access-date=August 22, 2020}}</ref> The French cinema site [[AlloCin\u00e9]] gave the film a rating of 3.6/5 stars based on 32 reviews.<ref>{{Citation|last=AlloCin\u00e9|title=Critiques Presse pour le film R\u00e9alit\u00e9 - AlloCin\u00e9|url=http://www.allocine.fr/film/fichefilm-204027/critiques/presse/|access-date=August 30, 2020}}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{official website|http://www.realitydupieux.com/}}\n* {{IMDb title|2392672}}\n* {{rotten-tomatoes|reality_2015}}\n\n{{Quentin Dupieux}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Reality}}\n[[Category:2014 films]]\n[[Category:2014 comedy-drama films]]\n[[Category:2010s English-language films]]\n[[Category:2010s French-language films]]\n[[Category:French comedy-drama films]]\n[[Category:Belgian comedy-drama films]]\n[[Category:French satirical films]]\n[[Category:Films about filmmaking]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Quentin Dupieux]]\n[[Category:2010s satirical films]]\n[[Category:Belgian satirical films]]\n[[Category:English-language Belgian films]]\n[[Category:English-language French films]]\n[[Category:French-language Belgian films]]\n[[Category:2010s French films]]\n\n\n{{2010s-France-film-stub}}"}]}}}}
