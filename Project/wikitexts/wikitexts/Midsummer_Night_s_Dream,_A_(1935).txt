Brown (comedian)|Joe E. Brown]], [[Dick Powell]], [[Ross Alexander]], [[Anita Louise]], [[Victor Jory]] and [[Ian Hunter (actor)|Ian Hunter]]. Produced by [[Henry Blanke]] and [[Hal B. Wallis]] for [[Warner Brothers]], and adapted by [[Charles Kenyon]] and [[Mary C. McCall Jr.]] from Reinhardt's [[Hollywood Bowl]] production of the previous year, the film is about the events surrounding the marriage of the Duke of Athens, Theseus, and the Queen of the Amazons, Hippolyta. These include the adventures of four young Athenian lovers and a group of six amateur actors, who are controlled and manipulated by the fairies who inhabit the forest in which most of the story is set. The play, which is categorized as a comedy, is one of Shakespeare's most popular works for the stage and is widely performed across the world. [[Felix Mendelssohn]]'s music was extensively used, as re-orchestrated by [[Erich Wolfgang Korngold]]. The ballet sequences featuring the fairies were choreographed by [[Bronislava Nijinska]].\n\n==Plot==\n{{Long plot|date=August 2022}}\n'''''Part one'''''\n\nA beautiful young woman named Hermia ([[Olivia de Havilland]]) is in love with Lysander ([[Dick Powell]]) and wishes to marry him. Her father Egeus ([[Grant Mitchell (actor)|Grant Mitchell]]), however, has instructed her to marry Demetrius ([[Ross Alexander]]), whom he has chosen for her. When Hermia refuses to obey, stating she is in love with Lysander, her father invokes before Duke Theseus of Athens ([[Ian Hunter (actor)|Ian Hunter]]) an ancient Athenian law that states a daughter must marry the suitor chosen by her father, or face death. Theseus offers her another choice\u2014to live a life of chastity as a nun and worship the goddess Diana.\n\nMeanwhile, Peter Quince ([[Frank McHugh]]) and his fellow players gather to produce a stage play about the cruel death of [[Pyramus and Thisbe]] in honor of the Duke and his upcoming marriage to Hippolyta ([[Verree Teasdale]]). Quince reads the names of characters and assigns them to the players. Nick Bottom ([[James Cagney]]), who is playing the main role of Pyramus, is over-enthusiastic and suggests himself for the characters of Thisbe, the Lion, and Pyramus at the same time. He also prefers being a tyrant and recites some lines of Ercles. Quince ends the meeting instructing his players to meet at the Duke's oak tree.\n \nIn the forest outside Athens, Oberon ([[Victor Jory]]), the king of the fairies, and Titania ([[Anita Louise]]) his queen, are having an argument. Titania tells Oberon that she plans to stay there to attend the wedding of Duke Theseus and Hippolyta. Oberon and Titania are estranged: She refuses to give her Indian [[changeling]] to Oberon for use as his knight because the child's mother was one of Titania's worshippers. Wanting to punish Titania's disobedience, Oberon instructs his mischievous court jester Puck ([[Mickey Rooney]]) to retrieve a flower called \"love-in-idleness\". Originally a white flower, it turns purple when struck by Cupid's bow. When someone applies the magical love potion to a sleeping person's eyelids, it makes the victim fall in love with the first living creature seen upon awakening.\n\nOberon comes across a sleeping Titania and applies the love potion to her eyes. He intends to make Titania fall in love with the first creature she sees when waking up, which he is sure will be an animal of the forest. Oberon's intent is to shame Titania into giving up the little Indian changeling.\n\nMeanwhile, Hermia and Lysander have escaped to the same forest in hopes of eloping. Demetrius, who is also in love with Hermia, pursues them into the forest. He is followed by Helena ([[Jean Muir (actress)|Jean Muir]]), who is desperate to reclaim Demetrius' love. Helena continues to make advances toward Demetrius, promising to love him more than Hermia, but he rebuffs her with cruel insults. When Oberon sees this, he orders Puck to spread some of the love potion on the eyelids of Demetrius. When Puck later discovers the sleeping Lysander, he mistakes him for Demetrius\u2014not having seen either before\u2014and administers the love potion to the sleeping Lysander.\n\nDuring the night, Helena comes across the sleeping Lysander and wakes him up while attempting to determine whether he is dead or asleep. When he lays eyes on her, Lysander immediately falls in love with Helena. Meanwhile, the mischievous Puck turns Bottom into a donkey (from the neck up). When Titania wakes up and lays eyes on Bottom as a donkey, she falls in love with him. Oberon finds the abandoned changeling and takes him away.\n\n'''''Part two'''''\n\nWhen Oberon sees Demetrius still following Hermia, he instructs Puck to bring Helena to him while he applies the love potion to the sleeping Demetrius' eyes. Upon waking up, Demetrius sees Helena, and now both Lysander and Demetrius are in love with Helena, who is convinced that her two suitors are simply mocking her. When Hermia encounters Helena with her two suitors, she accuses Helena of stealing Lysander away from her. The four quarrel with each other until Lysander and Demetrius become so enraged that they seek a place to duel each other to prove whose love for Helena is the greatest. Oberon orders Puck to keep Lysander and Demetrius from catching up with one another and to remove the charm from Lysander. After Puck applies the potion to the sleeping Lysander's eyes, he returns to loving Hermia, while Demetrius continues to love Helena. And Titania is still in love with the donkey-headed Bottom.\n\nOberon leads all the fairies away with the changeling at his side. Having achieved his goals, Oberon releases Titania from her spell and they leave together in love once again. Following Oberon's instructions, Puck removes the donkey's head from Bottom, and arranges everything so that Hermia, Lysander, Demetrius, and Helena all believe that they have been dreaming when they awaken. Together they return from the forest to attend the wedding of Duke Theseus and Hippolyta. When Theseus sees Hermia and her father Egeus, and seeing that Demetrius does not love Hermia any more, Theseus overrules Egeus's demands and arranges a group wedding\u2014Hermia to marry Lysander, and Helena to marry Demetrius. The lovers decide that the previous night's events must have been a dream.\n\nThat night at the wedding, they all watch Bottom and his fellow players perform ''Pyramus and Thisbe''. Unprepared as they are, the performers are so terrible playing their roles that the guests laugh as if it were meant to be a comedy. Before the encore, the guests sneak away and retire to bed. Afterwards, Oberon, Titania, Puck, and the other fairies enter, and bless the house and its occupants with good fortune. After everyone leaves, Puck suggests to the audience that what they just experienced might be nothing but a dream.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:A Midsummer Night's Dream 1935.JPG|thumb|Left to right: Ross Alexander, Dick Powell, Jean Muir and Olivia de Havilland]]\n'''''The Athenian Court'''''\n* [[Ian Hunter (actor)|Ian Hunter]] as [[Theseus]], Duke of Athens\n* [[Verree Teasdale]] as [[Hippolyta]], Queen of the Amazons, betrothed to Theseus\n* [[Hobart Cavanaugh]] as Philostrate, Master of Revels to Theseus\n* [[Dick Powell]] as [[Lysander (Shakespeare)|Lysander]], In love with Hermia\n* [[Ross Alexander]] as Demetrius, In love with Hermia\n* [[Olivia de Havilland]] as [[Hermia]], In love with Lysander\n* [[Jean Muir (actress)|Jean Muir]] as [[Helena (A Midsummer Night's Dream)|Helena]], In love with Demetrius\n* [[Grant Mitchell (actor)|Grant Mitchell]] as Egeus, Father to Hermia\n\n'''''The Players'''''\n* [[Frank McHugh]] as Quince, the Carpenter\n* [[Dewey Robinson]] as Snug, the Joiner\n* [[James Cagney]] as [[Nick Bottom|Bottom]], the Weaver\n* [[Joe E.

The full 132 minute version was not seen again until it turned up on cable television in 1994. The film was then re-issued at its full length on VHS (its first video release was of the edited version). Later showings on Turner Classic Movies have restored the film's pre-credits Overture, and its Exit Music, neither of which had been heard since its 1935 road show presentations. In August, 2007, it was released on DVD for the first time, both individually and as part of a box set known as ''The Shakespeare Collection''.\n\n==Critical response==\nThe film failed at the box office and received mixed reviews, with the cinematography, the use of Mendelssohn's music, and the dance sequences being highly praised. Although James Cagney was acclaimed for his performance, Warner Bros. was criticized by film critic Richard Watts, Jr. for \"weakening\" enough to cast an actor \"whose performance is not much short of fatal\" (i.e. box-office favorite Dick Powell, then in his \"Hollywood crooner\" phase, who reportedly realized he was completely wrong for the role of Lysander and asked to be taken off the film, to no avail).<ref>http://www.users.miamioh.edu/erlichrd/shax-film2001/mnd_guide.html</ref>\n\n''Variety'' wrote of the film: \"Question of whether a Shakespearean play can be successfully produced on a lavish scale for the films is affirmatively answered by this commendable effort. (...) The fantasy, the ballets of the Oberon and Titania cohorts, and the characters in the eerie sequences are convincing and illusion compelling. Film is replete with enchanting scenes, beautifully photographed and charmingly presented. All Shakespearian devotees will be pleased at the soothing treatment given to the Mendelssohn score. (...) The women are uniformly better than the men. They get more from their lines. The selection of Dick Powell to play Lysander was unfortunate. He never seems to catch the spirit of the play or role. And Mickey Rooney, as Puck, is so intent on being cute that he becomes almost annoying. There are some outstanding performances, however, notably Victor Jory as Oberon. His clear, distinct diction indicates what can be done by careful recitation and good recording; Olivia de Havilland, as Hermia, is a fine artist here; others are Jean Muir, Verree Teasdale and Anita Louise, the latter beautiful as Titania but occasionally indistinct in her lines.\"\n\nWriting for ''The Spectator'' in 1935, [[Graham Greene]] discussed the mixed contemporary reviews of the film and claimed for himself that he had enjoyed the film - something Greene speculated might be attributed to his lack of affection for [[A Midsummer Night's Dream|the play]]. He characterized the acting as \"fresh and vivid\" due to its lack of \"proper Shakespearian diction and bearing\"; however, he criticized the film's direction, noting that Reinhardt seemed \"uncertain of his new medium\" and that \"much of the production is poised [...] on the edge of absurdity because Herr Reinhardt cannot visualize how his ideas will work out on the screen\".<ref>{{cite journal |last= Greene|first= Graham|author-link= Graham Greene|date= 18 October 1935|title= A Midsummer Night's Dream|journal= [[The Spectator]]}} (reprinted in: {{cite book|editor-last= Taylor|editor-first= John Russell|editor-link= John Russell Taylor|date= 1980|title= The Pleasure Dome|url= https://archive.org/details/pleasuredomegrah00gree/page/28|pages= [https://archive.org/details/pleasuredomegrah00gree/page/28 28\u201329]|isbn= 0192812866}})</ref>\n\nToday, the film gets mostly good reviews. Emanuel Levy writes: \"Bold and impressive, Reinhardt's screen version of his famous Hollywood Bowl Shakespearean production was nominated for the Best Picture Oscar.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1013867-midsummer_nights_dream/|title=A Midsummer Night's Dream|publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|access-date=27 January 2018}}</ref> {{as of|2020|Sep|22|df=US}}, Reinhardt's ''A Midsummer Night's Dream''  holds a 91% rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 8 reviews.\n\n==Accolades==\nThe film won two [[Academy Awards]]: \n* [[Academy Award for Best Cinematography|Best Cinematography]] - [[Hal Mohr]]\n* [[academy Award for Best Film Editing|Best Film Editing]] - [[Ralph Dawson]]\n\nIt was nominated for: \n* Best Picture - [[Henry Blanke]], producer\n* Best Assistant Director - [[Sherry Shourds]]\n\nHal Mohr was not nominated for his work on the movie; he won the Oscar thanks to a grass-roots write-in campaign. It was Mohr who decided that the trees should be sprayed with orange paint, giving them the eerie glow which added to the \"fairyland\" effect in the film.
