It shows the work of the Office of Capital Collateral Regional counsel, led by attorney Joseph T. Hobson, who is both interviewed and featured in the film and who seeks to vacate Wuornos' death sentences. It shows Judge Victor Musleh presiding over these proceedings and assistant state attorney, now judge, James McCune, who defended the death sentences for the State of Florida. Hobson is shown vigorously cross-examining Wuornos' trial counsel, Steven Glazer, aka \"Dr. Legal\". Glazer was the unflattering subject of a prior Broomfield documentary on Aileen Wuornos, ''[[Aileen Wuornos: The Selling of a Serial Killer]]''. It was Hobson's line of attack that the efficacy of his client's (Wuornos') trial strategy was compromised by Glazer's pecuniary and self-promotional aims.\n\nThe film climaxes in a final interview with Wuornos one day before her execution. In the interview, she states that she was tortured while in prison and claims that the prison used \"sonic pressure\" to control or alter her mental state. In a fit of rage, Wuornos rails against a society that she says \"railroaded my ass\" before abruptly ending the interview. Broomfield comments that he finds it hard to understand how the same person in front of him was deemed \"of sound mind\" the day before by Florida governor [[Jeb Bush]]'s psychiatric examiners.\n\nThe film concludes with footage of a prison spokesman reading Wuornos' final statement at a press conference after her execution: \"I'm sailing with the Rock, and I'll be back. Like ''[[Independence Day (1996 film)|Independence Day]]'' with [[Jesus]], June 6, like the movie, big mothership and all. I'll be back, I'll be back.\"\n\n== Box office ==\nThe film received a limited theatrical release in North America<ref name=\"mojo\" >{{cite web|title=Aileen: The Life and Death of a Serial Killer|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=aileenthelifeanddeathofaserialkiller.htm|website=[[Box Office Mojo]]|accessdate=10 August 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"release\" >{{cite web|title=Box office / business for Aileen: Life and Death of a Serial Killer (2003)|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=aileenthelifeanddeathofaserialkiller.htm|website=[[Internet Movie Database]]|accessdate=10 August 2015}}</ref> several weeks after the Aileen Wuornos biopic ''[[Monster (2003 film)|Monster]]'' opened to generally positive reviews.
