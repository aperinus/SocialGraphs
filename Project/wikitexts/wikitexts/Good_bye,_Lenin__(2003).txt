When she awakens eight months later in June 1990, her son (Br\u00fchl) attempts to protect her from a fatal shock by concealing the [[fall of the Berlin Wall]] and the [[collapse of communism]] in East Germany.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b86c76b63|title=GOOD BYE, LENIN!

Alex's father purportedly abandoned the family for a mistress in [[West Germany|the West]] in 1978. His mother joined the [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany|Socialist Unity Party]] and devotes her time to advocating for citizens. While Christiane believes socialism can improve Germany and the world, her children are realistic. Alex is disgusted with the [[East German Republic Day Parade of 1989|celebration of East Germany's 40th anniversary]] and participates in an [[Monday demonstrations in East Germany|anti-government demonstration]]. There he meets a girl but they are separated by the ''[[Volkspolizei]]'' before they can introduce themselves.\n\nChristiane, seeing Alex being arrested and beaten, suffers a [[heart attack]] and falls into a [[coma]] because nobody initially comes to her aid. Visiting his mother in hospital, Alex finds that her nurse, Lara, is the girl from the demonstration. She and Alex begin dating shortly afterwards.\n\n[[Erich Honecker]] resigns, [[Egon Krenz]] takes over, the [[Berlin border crossings|borders]] are opened, the [[Berlin Wall]] [[fall of the Berlin Wall|falls]], East Germany holds [[1990 East German general election|free elections]], and [[capitalism]] comes to East Berlin. Alex begins working for a West German firm selling and installing [[satellite dishes]]. He befriends a western colleague, aspiring filmmaker Denis Domaschke. Ariane's university closes and she works at [[Burger King]] instead. She begins dating the manager, Rainer, who moves into their apartment.\n\nAfter eight months, Christiane awakens from her coma. Her doctor warns her family that she is still weak and any shock might cause another, possibly fatal, heart attack. Alex resolves to conceal the [[Die Wende|profound societal changes]] from her and maintain the illusion that the [[German Democratic Republic]] is just as it was before her coma. He, Ariane, and Lara retrieve their old East German furniture from storage, dress in their old clothes, and repackage new Western food in old East German jars. The deception is increasingly complicated as Christiane witnesses strange occurrences, such as a gigantic [[Coca-Cola]] banner on an adjacent building. Denis and Alex create [[fake news]] broadcasts from old [[Aktuelle Kamera|East German news]] tapes to explain these odd events. Alex and Ariane fail to find where Christiane keeps her life savings (in [[East German mark]]s) in time to exchange them for [[Deutsche Mark|West German marks]] before the deadline.\n\nChristiane gets stronger and one day wanders outside while Alex is asleep. She sees her neighbours' furniture stacked in the street, new West German cars for sale, advertisements for Western corporations, and a statue of [[Lenin]] being flown away by helicopter. Alex and Ariane take her back home and show her a fake newscast explaining East Germany is now accepting refugees from the West following an [[economic crisis]] there.\n\nAt the family [[dacha]] Christiane reveals her own secret: her husband had fled not for a mistress but because of the difficulties he faced for refusing to join the ruling party. The plan had been for the rest of the family to join him. Christiane, fearing the [[government of East Germany|government]] would take her children if things went wrong, decided to stay. Contrary to what she had told her children, their father wrote many letters that she hid. As she declares her wish to see her husband one last time to make amends, she relapses and is taken back to hospital.\n\nAlex meets his father, Robert, who has remarried, has two children, and lives in [[West Berlin]]. He convinces him to see Christiane one last time. Under pressure to reveal the truth about the fall of the East, Alex creates a final fake news segment, persuading a taxi driver (who resembles cosmonaut [[Sigmund J\u00e4hn]], the first German in space and Alex's childhood hero) to act in the false news report as the new leader of East Germany and to give a speech about opening the borders to the West. However, unbeknownst to Alex, Lara had already recounted the true political developments to Christiane earlier that day.\n\nChristiane dies two days later, outliving the German Democratic Republic by three days after German reunification. The family and friends scatter her ashes in the wind using a toy rocket Alex made with his father during childhood.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Daniel Br\u00fchl]] as Alexander \"Alex\" Kerner\n** Nico Lederm\u00fcller as 11-year-old Alex\n* [[Katrin Sass]] as Christiane Kerner\n* [[Chulpan Khamatova]] as Lara\n* [[Maria Simon (actress)|Maria Simon]] as Ariane Kerner\n* [[Florian Lukas]] as Denis Domaschke\n* [[Alexander Beyer]] as Rainer\n* [[Burghart Klau\u00dfner]] as Robert Kerner\n* [[Michael Gwisdek]] as Klapprath\n* [[Christine Schorn]] as Frau Sch\u00e4fer\n* [[J\u00fcrgen Holtz]] as Herr Ganske\n* Jochen Stern as Herr Mehlert\n* [[Stefan Walz]] as a [[Sigmund J\u00e4hn]] look-alike taxi-driver\n* Eberhard Kirchberg as Dr. Wagner\n* [[Hans-Uwe Bauer]] as Dr. Mewes\n}}\n\n==Development==\nFor director Wolfgang Becker, work on ''Good Bye Lenin!'' began in the summer of 1999,<ref>{{Cite AV media|title=Good Bye, Lenin!|chapter=Audio Commentary of Wolfgang Becker|date=2003|publisher=X-Editition}}</ref> but for screenwriter Bernd Lichtenberg, the work had already begun almost a decade earlier. Lichtenberg\u2019s experience of the [[German reunification|reunification period]] as a New [[West Berlin]]er at a similar age to his protagonist Alex was formed into a story which already included many aspects of the later film, but first ended up \"in the drawer\" for a few years. He stated: \u201cI had the feeling that it simply wasn\u2019t the right time yet.\u201d This only changed when he saw Becker's ''[[Life Is All You Get|Life is All You Get]]'' (German: ''Das Leben ist eine Baustelle''). Especially interested in the mix of sadness and comedy, which he himself also envisaged for his film, he believed he had found the right person to bring his idea to life. He was not mistaken.<ref name=\"Good Bye, Lenin!\">{{cite AV media|title=Good Bye, Lenin!|chapter=''Bernd Lichtenberg: Eine Familiengeschichte.''|date=2003|publisher=X-Editition}}</ref>\n\"All of a sudden there was this energy\",{{Quote without source|date=January 2022}} recalls producer [[Stefan Arndt]] during the recording of the 5-page [[wikt:synopsis|synopsis]] with Becker. \u201cWe knew we could tell the story in just the way we would like to.\u201d{{Quote without source|date=January 2022}}\n\nNevertheless, it was not an easy process to finish the script. It supposedly took them six drafts plus a few interim versions to complete the script. Lichtenberg wrote the first drafts by himself. He stayed in close contact with Becker who voiced his criticism, especially of the characters. This was an important point for both of them so it was one they argued over as they both wanted to tell the story \u201cthrough the characters\u201d. The character that underwent the most radical change was Denis, as he was changed from a main character to a side character. The role of Denis, who was previously conceived as an young overweight boy from Turkey who was to be married off against his will, became an amateur film maker, who is as boldly-imaginative as he is practical. After completing the script, which the screenwriter and producer worked on together towards the end, their collaboration was not over. During the actual filming, Lichtenberg was involved whenever Becker wanted more changes.<ref name=\"Good Bye, Lenin!\"/><ref>{{Cite AV media|title=Good Bye, Lenin!|chapter=\u201eDer Schmerz geht, der Film bleibt \u2013 das Making of\u201c|date=2004|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n==Soundtrack==\n{{Main|Good Bye Lenin! (soundtrack)}}\nThe [[film score]] was composed by [[Yann Tiersen]], except the version of \"Summer 78\" sung by [[Claire Pichet]]. Stylistically, the music is very similar to Tiersen's earlier work on the [[Am\u00e9lie (soundtrack)|soundtrack to ''Am\u00e9lie'']]. One piano composition, \"Comptine d'un autre \u00e9t\u00e9 : L'apr\u00e8s-midi\", is used in both films.\n\nSeveral famous East German songs are featured. Two children, members of the [[Ernst Th\u00e4lmann Pioneer Organisation]], sing \"''[[Unsere Heimat]]''\" ('Our Homeland'). Friends of Christiane's (living in the same building) follow with \"''{{lang|de|Bau Auf! Bau Auf!}}''\" ('Build Up! Build Up!'), another anthem of the [[Free German Youth]]. The final fake newscast with Sigmund J\u00e4hn features a rousing rendition of the East German national anthem, \"''[[Auferstanden aus Ruinen]]''\".\n\n==''Ostalgie''==\nAlex creates fictional newscasts to reminisce about his earlier East German lifestyle as well as a communist environment. He goes out of his way to use East German products to fool his mother such as [[Spreewald gherkins]] and although this is for his mother, there is also a hint he himself is creating a fantasy in which he would like to live. Alex lived his whole life with this barrier; therefore the drastic change is hard for him unlike his older sister Ariane. Ariane quickly adopts the new Western ideals and lifestyle, but Alex experiences nostalgia for their former way of life. ''[[Ostalgie]]'' is a neologism for the [[Communist nostalgia|nostalgia for a communist past]] which is a common theme in ''Good Bye Lenin!''<ref name=\"Greenleft\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.greenleft.org.au/content/goodbye-lenin-hello-ostalgie|title=Goodbye Lenin, hello 'Ostalgie'|date=2016-09-06|work=Green Left Weekly|access-date=2017-12-15}}</ref> Alex shows signs of ''ostalgie'' when he begins to increasingly criticise the Western changes in themselves.<ref name=\"Greenleft\" />\n\nIn 2004 the ''New York Times'' commented on \"Ostalgie\" which was embodied in the town of [[Eisenh\u00fcttenstadt]].<ref name=\"Greenleft\" /> It became popular because of ''Good Bye Lenin!'' which imitated Christiane's bedroom. This put a lot of light on the ''ostalgie'' situation, in addition to the film.\n\n==Reception==\nThe film received strongly positive reviews, and has a rating of 90% on [[Rotten Tomatoes]]. ''[[Empire (film magazine)|Empire]]'' magazine gave the film four stars out of five, saying: \"An ingenious little idea that is funny, moving and\u2014gasp!\u2014even makes you think.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.empireonline.com/reviews/review.asp?DVDID=9862 |title=Empire's Good Bye, Lenin!
