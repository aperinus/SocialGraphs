It incorporates elements of dark humor and [[existentialist]] drama. The plot follows the exploits of Harold Chasen ([[Bud Cort]]), a young man who is intrigued with death, and who rejects the life his detached mother ([[Vivian Pickles]]) prescribes for him. Harold develops a friendship, and eventual romantic relationship, with 79-year-old Maude ([[Ruth Gordon]]) who teaches Harold about the importance of living life to its fullest.\n\nThe screenplay by [[Colin Higgins]] began as his master's thesis for film school. Filming locations in the [[San Francisco Bay Area]] included both [[Holy Cross Cemetery (Colma, California)|Holy Cross Cemetery]] and [[Golden Gate National Cemetery]], the ruins of the [[Sutro Baths]] and Rose Court Mansion in [[Hillsborough, California]].\n\nCritically and commercially unsuccessful when first released, the film eventually developed a [[cult following]], and first made a profit in 1983.<ref name=\"times\" /><ref name=\"Peary\">{{cite book | author-link = Danny Peary | first = Danny | last = Peary | title = [[Cult Movies (book)|Cult Movies]] | publisher = Delta Books | year = 1981 | isbn = 0-517-20185-2 }}</ref> The film was selected for preservation in the [[National Film Registry]] in 1997, and was ranked number 45 on the [[American Film Institute]] list of [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Laughs|100 funniest movies of all time]] in 2000.

He stages elaborate [[Faked death|fake suicides]], attends [[funeral]]s (usually for people that he doesn't know), and drives a [[hearse]], all to the chagrin of his self-obsessed, wealthy socialite mother.<ref name=\"Allmovie\">{{cite web |url=http://www.allmovie.com/work/harold-and-maude-21605 |title=Harold and Maude > Overview |last1 = Bozzola | first1 = Lucia |work=[[Allmovie]] |access-date=8 March 2010}}</ref> His mother sends Harold to a [[psychoanalyst]], sets him up with blind dates, and buys him a [[luxury car]], all schemes he subverts in his own way.\n\nHarold meets 79-year-old Maude one day while at a random stranger's [[Requiem|funeral Mass]], and discovers that they share a hobby. Harold is entranced by Maude's quirky outlook on life, which is bright and delightfully carefree in contrast with his moribund demeanor. Maude lives in a decommissioned [[railroad car]] and thinks nothing of breaking the law; she is quite skilled at [[Motor vehicle theft|stealing cars]] and will swiftly uproot an ailing tree on public property to re-plant it in the forest. She and Harold form a bond and Maude shows Harold the pleasures of art and music (including how to play [[banjo]]), and teaches him how to make \"the most of his time on earth.\"<ref name=\"Allmovie\"/> Meanwhile, Harold's mother is determined, against Harold's wishes, to [[Arranged marriage|find him a wife]]. One by one, Harold frightens and horrifies each of his appointed [[Computer dating|computer dates]], by appearing to commit gruesome acts: [[self-immolation]], [[self-mutilation]], and [[seppuku]]. His mother tries enlisting him in the military by sending Harold to his uncle, who lost an arm serving under [[General MacArthur]] in the [[Second World War]], but Harold deters the recruitment by staging a scene where Maude poses as a [[Pacifism|pacifist protester]] and Harold seemingly murders her out of militarist [[fanaticism]].\n\nAs Harold and Maude grow closer, their friendship blossoms into a [[Romance (love)|romance]]. Holding her hand, Harold discovers a number tattooed on her forearm, indicating Maude survived the Nazi death camps. Harold announces that he will marry Maude, resulting in disgusted outbursts from his family, analyst, and priest. Unbeknownst to  Harold, Maude has been planning to commit suicide on her eightieth birthday. Maude's birthday arrives, and Harold throws a surprise party for her. As the pair dance, Maude tells Harold that she \"couldn't imagine a lovelier farewell.\" When Maude reveals that she has taken an [[overdose]] of [[Hypnotic|sleeping pills]], and will be dead by midnight, Harold rushes Maude to the hospital. After learning of Maude's death, Harold is shown speeding down a country road, and sending the car off a seaside cliff. After the crash, the final shot reveals Harold standing calmly atop the cliff, holding his banjo and wearing colorful clothing for the first time in the film. After gazing down at the wreckage, he dances away to \"[[If You Want to Sing Out, Sing Out]]\".\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Ruth Gordon]] as Dame Marjorie \"Maude\" Chardin, a 79-year-old free spirit. Maude believes in living each day to the fullest, and \"trying something new every day\". Her view of life is so joyful that, true to the film's motif, it crosses a blurred, shifting line into a carefree attitude toward death as well. We know little of her past, but learn that as a young woman she was a radical [[suffragette]] who fought off police constables with her umbrella, was once married, lived in pre-war Vienna, and has a [[Identification of inmates in German concentration camps|Nazi concentration camp tattoo]] on her arm.\n*[[Bud Cort]] as Harold Parker Chasen, a young man who is obsessed with death. He drives a hearse, attends funerals of strangers and stages elaborate fake suicides. Through meeting and falling in love with Maude, he discovers joy in living for the first time.\n*[[Vivian Pickles]] as Mrs. Chasen, Harold's opulently wealthy mother, is controlling, snooty and seemingly incapable of affection. Hoping to force him into respectability, Mrs. Chasen replaces Harold's beloved hearse with a [[Jaguar E-Type|Jaguar]] (which he then converts to a miniature hearse), and sets up several blind dates (more accurately, \"bride interviews\") for her son.\n*[[Cyril Cusack]] as Glaucus, the sculptor who makes an ice statue of Maude and lends them his tools to transport a tree.\n*[[Charles Tyner]] as General Victor Ball, Harold's uncle who lost an arm in the war and now pulls a hidden cord to make his wire prosthetic \"salute\". At Mrs. Chasen's request, he attempts to prepare Harold to join the armed forces. The effort is thwarted by a planned stunt in which Harold appears to \"kill\" Maude.\n*[[Eric Christmas]] as the Priest.\n*[[G. Wood|George Wood]] as Harold's psychiatrist.\n*[[Ellen Geer]] as Sunshine Dor\u00e9, an actress, Harold's third blind date. She is one of the few arranged dates who take part in mimicking Harold's suicides, giving a histrionic rendition of Juliet's death scene.\n*Judy Engles as Candy Gulf, Harold's first blind date, whom he scares off by apparently setting himself on fire.\n*Shari Summers as Edith Phern, Harold's second blind date, whom he dissuades by pretending to cut off his hand.\n*[[Tom Skerritt]] (credited as \"M.

While working as producer Edward Lewis's pool boy, Higgins showed the script to Lewis's wife, Mildred. Mildred was so impressed that she got Edward to give it to [[Stanley R. Jaffe|Stanley Jaffe]] at Paramount. Higgins sold the script with the understanding that he would direct the film but he was told he wasn't ready, after tests he shot proved unsatisfactory to the studio heads. Ashby would only commit to directing the film after getting Higgins' blessing and then, so Higgins could watch and learn from him on the set, Ashby made Higgins a co-producer.<ref>{{cite book |last=Dawson |first=Nick |year=2009 |title=Being Hal Ashby : life of a Hollywood rebel |publication-place=Lexington, KY |publisher=University Press of Kentucky |pages=120\u2013121 |isbn=978-0-8131-2538-1 |doi=10.5810/kentucky/9780813125381.001.0001}}</ref> Higgins says he originally thought of the story as a play.

Other different details include the novel's version of Maude having white hair (unlike Ruth Gordon in the film) and introducing herself as \"the Countess Mathilde Chardin,\" a different name and title than used in the film. In the novel, Maude's home is characterized as a \"cottage\" (unlike the retired railroad car Maude inhabits in the movie), and she and Harold briefly interact with Maude's neighbor, Madame Arouet, who is not present in the film. The novel includes an additional scene during the tree-planting expedition where Maude leads Harold in climbing to the top of a very tall pine tree to show him the view over the forest from near its summit.\n\n==Release==\n''Harold and Maude'' was released with a vague, text-only poster and very little marketing. The initial release was a [[box-office flop]], but it gradually found success in [[repertory theatre]]s and recouped its costs after several years.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://variety.com/2021/film/news/harold-and-maude-oral-history-flop-cult-classic-1235130303/ |title='Harold and Maude' at 50: An Oral History of How a 'Harrowing' Flop Became a Beloved Cult Classic |date=2021-12-10 |website=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |access-date=2022-07-15}}</ref> According to [[Danny Peary]], author of the [[Cult Movies (book)|Cult Movies]] series: \"The film was a runaway [[cult favorite]], and, most memorably, in Minneapolis, residents actually picketed the Westgate Theater, and tried to get the management to replace the picture after a consecutive three-year run.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=Cult Movies: The Classics, The Sleepers, The Weird and the Wonderful|last=Peary|first=Danny|publisher=Gramercy Books|year=1981|isbn=0-517-20185-2|location=U.S.A.|pages=135}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=Lileks|first=James|date=2018-02-09|title=When a Twin Cities movie theater vanishes, it takes neighborhood history with it|url=https://www.startribune.com/when-a-small-twin-cities-movie-theater-vanishes-it-takes-neighborhood-history-with-it/473590023/|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180715003851/https://www.startribune.com/when-a-small-twin-cities-movie-theater-vanishes-it-takes-neighborhood-history-with-it/473590023/|archive-date=2018-07-15|access-date=2021-10-19|website=Star Tribune}}</ref>\n\n===Critical response===\n''Harold and Maude'' received mixed reviews, with several critics being offended by the film's [[black comedy|dark humor]]. [[Roger Ebert]], in a review dated January 1, 1972, gave the film one-and-a-half out of four stars. He wrote, \"And so what we get, finally, is a movie of attitudes. Harold is death, Maude life, and they manage to make the two seem so similar that life's hardly worth the extra bother. The visual style makes everyone look fresh from the Wax Museum, and all the movie lacks is a lot of day-old gardenias and lilies and roses in the lobby, filling the place with a cloying sweet smell. Nothing more to report today. Harold doesn't even make pallbearer.\"<ref>[[Roger Ebert|Ebert, Roger]] (January 1, 1972). \"[http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19720101/REVIEWS/201010313 Harold and Maude]\". ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]''. Retrieved 2011-09-08.</ref> [[Vincent Canby]] also panned the film, stating that the actors \"are so aggressive, so creepy and off-putting, that Harold and Maude are obviously made for each other, a point the movie itself refuses to recognize with a twist ending that betrays, I think, its life-affirming pretensions.\"<ref>[https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9402EFDF1439EF3BBC4152DFBE668382679EDE \"Screen: 'Harold and Maude' and Life: Hal Ashby's Comedy Opens at Coronet; Ruth Gordon, Bud Cort Star as Odd Couple\"], ''[[The New York Times]]'' review by Vincent Canby, December 21, 1971.
