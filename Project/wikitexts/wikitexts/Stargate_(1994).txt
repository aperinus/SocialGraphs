The film is the first entry in the [[Stargate|''Stargate'' media franchise]] and stars [[Kurt Russell]], [[James Spader]], [[Jaye Davidson]], [[Alexis Cruz]], [[Mili Avital]], and [[Viveca Lindfors]]. The plot centers on the premise of a \"[[Stargate (device)|Stargate]]\", an ancient ring-shaped device that creates a [[wormhole]], enabling travel to a similar device elsewhere in the universe. The film's central plot explores the theory of [[Extraterrestrials in fiction|extraterrestrial]] beings [[Ancient astronauts|having an influence upon human civilization]].\n\nOriginally theatrically released on October 28, 1994, by [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] (MGM), the film received mixed reviews, with its atmosphere, story, characters, and graphic content both praised and criticized. The film grossed $196.6 million worldwide against a production budget of $55 million.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1928 in [[Giza]], [[Egypt]], Catherine Langford's father unearthed cover stones (also called casing stones) engraved with [[Egyptian hieroglyphs]]. In 1994, she invites [[Egyptology|Egyptologist]] and [[linguistics|linguist]] [[Daniel Jackson (Stargate)|Daniel Jackson, Ph.D.]] to translate the hieroglyphs. The stones are now part of a [[United States Air Force|U.S. Air Force]] [[classified information|classified]] project overseen by [[Air Force Special Operations Command|Special Operations]] [[Colonel (United States)|Colonel]] [[Jack O'Neill|Jack O'Neil]]. Jackson determines that the hieroglyphs refer to a \"stargate\" which uses [[constellation]]s as spatial coordinates. He is then shown the Stargate, which was also discovered by Langford's father, and they use his coordinates to align the Stargate's metal ring with markings along its outside. When all seven are locked in, a [[wormhole]] opens, connecting the Stargate with a distant planet. Jackson joins O'Neil and his team (Reilly, Porro, Freeman, Brown, Ferretti, and Kawalsky) as they pass through the wormhole.\n\nThey arrive in a [[pyramid]] on the arid desert planet of [[List of Stargate SG-1 characters#Abydonians|Abydos]]. Jackson locates the Stargate's controls, but does not find all of the symbols for the return coordinates. O'Neil orders Reilly, Porro, Freeman, and Ferretti to stay behind to guard the Stargate. Jackson sees a large animal with a harness, which drags him off when he approaches it to investigate. O'Neil's group follows and they discover a tribe of humans working to mine a strange mineral. Jackson realizes that they speak a variant of [[Egyptian language|Ancient Egyptian]] and is able to communicate with them. He learns that the tribe sees him and his comrades as [[wikt:emissary|emissaries]] of their god [[Ra]]. The tribe's chieftain Kasuf presents Jackson with his daughter [[List of Stargate SG-1 characters#Sha're|Sha'uri]] as a gift, and although Jackson initially refuses her, he later becomes romantically attached to her. O'Neil befriends Kasuf's teenaged son Skaara and his friends. Through hidden markings and discussions with the tribe, Jackson learns that Ra is an alien being who came to Earth during the Ancient Egyptian period to possess human bodies to extend his own life. Ra enslaved these humans and used the Stargate to bring some of them to Abydos to mine the mineral that is used in the alien technology. Humans on Earth revolted, overthrew Ra's overseers, and buried the Stargate to prevent its use. During this investigation, Jackson comes across a [[cartouche]] containing six of the seven symbols for the Stargate, but the seventh has been broken off.\n\nThat night, Ra's ship lands atop the pyramid structure, and his soldiers capture Ferretti and Freeman while killing Porro and Reilly. When Jackson, O'Neil, Brown, and Kawalsky return, there is a firefight against Ra's soldiers. Jackson and O'Neil are captured and brought before Ra and his guards, who are revealed to be humanoids when they retract their armored head-pieces. A firefight ensues, Jackson is killed, and the others are captured. Ra places Jackson's body in a [[sarcophagus]]-like device that regenerates him. Ra tells Jackson that he has found a nuclear bomb O'Neil secretly brought and has used his alien technology to increase its explosive power a hundred-fold, threatening to send it back through the Stargate to Earth. Ra orders the human tribe to watch as he prepares to force Jackson to execute the others to demonstrate his power, but Skaara and his friends create a diversion that allows Jackson, O'Neil, Kawalsky, and Ferretti to escape, while Freeman is killed. They flee to nearby caves to hide from Ra. Skaara and his friends celebrate, and Skaara draws a sign of victory on a wall, which Jackson recognizes as the final symbol.\n\nO'Neil and his remaining men aid Skaara in overthrowing the remaining overseers and then launch an attack on Ra, who sends out fighter ships against the humans while he orders his ship to depart. The humans outside run out of ammunition and are forced to surrender to the fighter ships' pilots, but the rest of the tribe, seeing that their false gods are only humanoid, rebel against the pilots and overthrow them. Sha'uri is killed, but Jackson takes her body and sneaks aboard Ra's ship using a teleportation system, leaving O'Neil to fight Ra's guard captain, Anubis. Jackson places Sha'uri in the regeneration device, and she recovers, but Ra discovers them and attempts to kill Jackson. O'Neil activates the teleportation system, killing Anubis and allowing Jackson and Sha'uri to escape the ship. O'Neil and Jackson teleport the bomb to Ra's ship, destroying the ship and killing Ra. With the humans freed, the remaining team&nbsp;\u2014 O\u2019Neil, Kawalsky, and Ferretti&nbsp;\u2014 return to Earth while Jackson chooses to stay behind with Sha'uri and the others.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Kurt Russell]] as [[Jack O'Neill|Colonel Jonathan J. \"Jack\" O'Neil]], a career [[United States Air Force|U.S. Air Force]] [[Air Force Special Operations Command|Special Operations]] officer, who suffers a period of suicidal depression after his son accidentally shoots and kills himself with O'Neil's own pistol.

When Devlin and Emmerich edited the film in the director's cut to tighten the narrative, they decided to add a scene at the very beginning of the film to show who the human host of [[Ra]] was before the aliens took him. Only Davidson's upper torso was filmed.<ref name=\"acdevlin\" /> The first scene was a combination of model shots and a set in [[Yuma, Arizona]] where ''[[Rambo III]]'' had been filmed. The scene of the excavation of the Stargate was also filmed in three days in Arizona. A golden look was achieved by filming near the time of sunset.<ref name=\"acemmerich\" /> To keep within the limit of the budget, the producers put stick figures with cloth in the distant desert to appear as humans. The original Stargate was painted black, but it looked like a giant tire so it was repainted silver at the last moment.<ref name=\"acdevlin\" />\n\nDaniel Jackson's lecture on his theories was filmed in a hotel in Los Angeles.<ref name=\"acemmerich\" /> The scene was originally much longer and delved more into the theories that aliens had built the Egyptian pyramids, but it was trimmed for time concerns for the release.<ref name=\"acdevlin\" /> The scenes with O'Neil at his house were the first ones filmed with Kurt Russell; his hair was cut short afterwards. Russell requested his hair color to be brightened a little for the film.<ref name=\"acemmerich\" /> The fictional facility housing the Stargate was the largest set for the film, the former [[Spruce Goose]] Dome located in [[Long Beach, California]].<ref name=\"Dome\">{{cite news |last1=Pinsky |first1=Mark I. |title=Long Beach Dome Gets New Life in Film : Movies: The former home of the Spruce Goose earns good reviews as a production facility 'five times larger than the largest stage at Warner Bros.' |url=https://articles.latimes.com/1995-03-10/entertainment/ca-41097_1_long-beach |access-date=2 March 2019 |work=Los Angeles Times |date=10 March 1995}}</ref><ref name=\"acemmerich\" /> Egyptologist [[Stuart Tyson Smith]] joined the production to make all Ancient Egyptian hieroglyphics and spoken language as accurate as possible.<ref name=\"acdevlin\" />\n\n===Filming===\nThe mask of the [[pharaoh]] in the opening credits was made out of fiberglass and modeled in the workshop.

They used self-written image-creation and compositing software, as well as commercial digital packages to create the Stargate, the morphing helmets worn by Ra and the Horus guards, and the cityscape of Nagada. The morphing helmets were not true 3D but 2D elements, as Kleiser explained: \u201cYou shoot the character without the headdress, you shoot the character with a headdress. And then you have to go in and, and create all these little sections that you would then wipe off to reveal \u2013 and it had to match up, the two things had to match up.

The creation of the wormhole, which was fully digital, was one of the biggest challenges in the making of the film. The ripples had to be digitally composited to appear accurate and realistic. Scanning lasers were lined up parallel to the gate to illustrate the amount of body that passed the surface of the Stargate plane. Afterwards, the parts of the body that had or had not yet gone through the gate (depending on the side of filming) were obliterated with a digital matte, a process that removes unwanted components from an individual frame or sequence of frames.<ref name=\"specialeffects\" /> The funnel of water that precedes the Stargate opening was filmed by discharging an air cannon into a water tank, as Jeff Kleiser explained: \"\u201cWe didn\u2019t know how much air pressure to set the cannon on but it went from one to 500lbs, so we said \u2018Let\u2019s try 100 \u2013 start the camera rolling and hit the thing.\u2019 It evacuated all the water out of the tank and onto the camera and everybody.
