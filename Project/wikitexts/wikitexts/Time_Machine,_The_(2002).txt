G. Wells]] and the screenplay of the [[The Time Machine (1960 film)|1960 film of the same name]] by [[David Duncan (screenwriter)|David Duncan]]. [[Arnold Leibovit]] served as executive producer and [[Simon Wells]], the great-grandson of the original author, served as director. The film stars [[Guy Pearce]], [[Orlando Jones]], [[Samantha Mumba]], [[Mark Addy]], and [[Jeremy Irons]], and includes a [[Cameo appearance|cameo]] by [[Alan Young]], who also appeared in the 1960 film adaptation. The film is set in [[New York City]] instead of [[London]], and contains new story elements not present in the original novel nor the 1960 film adaptation, including a romantic backstory, a new scenario about how civilization was destroyed, and several new characters such as an artificially intelligent [[hologram]] and a Morlock leader.\n\nThe film received mixed reviews and grossed $123 million worldwide. It was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Makeup]] ([[John M. Elliot Jr.]] and [[Barbara Lorenz]]) at the [[75th Academy Awards]], but lost to ''[[Frida]]''.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for featured film articles should be 400-700 words. -->\nIn 1899, Dr. Alexander Hartdegen is an inventor teaching at [[Columbia University]] in [[New York City]]. Unlike his friend David Philby, Alexander would rather do pure research than work in the world of business. After a mugger kills his [[fianc\u00e9e]] Emma, he devotes himself to building a time machine that will allow him to [[time travel|travel back in time]] to save her. When he completes the machine four years later, he travels back to 1899 and prevents her murder, only to see her killed again when a [[horseless carriage]] frightens the horses of a [[horse-drawn vehicle]].\n\nAlexander realizes that any attempt to save Emma will result in her death through other circumstances. He travels to 2030 to discover whether science has been able to solve his question of how to change the past. At the [[New York Public Library]], a holographic [[librarian]] called Vox 114 insists time travel to the past is impossible. Alexander travels to 2037, when the accidental destruction of the [[Moon]] by [[colonization of the Moon|lunar colonists]] has begun rendering the Earth virtually uninhabitable. While restarting the time machine to avoid debris, he is knocked unconscious and travels forward to the date 16 July 802701 before reawakening.\n\nThe human race has reverted to a primitive lifestyle and the Earth has healed. Some survivors, called \"Eloi\", live on the sides of cliffs of what was once [[Manhattan]]. Alexander is nursed back to health by a virtuous young woman named Mara, one of the few Eloi who speak English. He observes the broken moon and realises that maybe his teachings led to this future. One night, Alexander and Mara's younger brother, Kalen, dream of a frightening, jagged-toothed face and a creature calling their name. Alexander informs Mara of the dream and she tells him they all have that dream, and she notices that his watch is missing. The next day, the Eloi are attacked and Mara is dragged underground by [[ape]]-like monsters. The creatures are called \"Morlocks\" and they hunt the Eloi for food. In order to rescue Mara, Kalen leads Alexander to Vox 114, which is still functional after 800,000 years.\n\nAfter learning from Vox how to find the Morlocks, Alexander enters their underground lair through an opening that resembles the face in his nightmare. He is captured and thrown into an area where Mara sits in a cage. Alexander meets an intelligent, humanoid \u00dcber-Morlock, who explains that Morlocks are the evolutionary descendants of the humans who went underground after the Moon broke apart, while the Eloi are evolved from those who remained on the surface. The \u00dcber-Morlocks are a caste of telepaths who rule the other Morlocks, and use the Eloi as breeding vessels for their Morlock offspring.\n\nThe \u00dcber-Morlock explains that Alexander cannot alter Emma's fate; her death is what drove him to build the time machine in the first place, therefore saving her would be a virtual impossibility due to temporal paradox. The \u00dcber-Morlock shows Alexander and tells him to go home, having given him the answer he had been searching for. Alexander gets into the machine but pulls the \u00dcber-Morlock in with him, carrying them into the future as they fight. The \u00dcber-Morlock dies by rapidly aging when Alexander pushes him outside of the machine's temporal bubble. Alexander stops in 635,427,810, revealing a harsh, rust-colored sky over a wasteland of Morlock caves.\n\nAccepting that he cannot save Emma, Alexander travels back to rescue Mara. After freeing her, he starts the time machine and jams its gears, creating a violent distortion in time. Pursued by the Morlocks, Alexander and Mara escape to the surface as the time distortion explodes, killing the Morlocks and destroying their caves along with the time machine. Alexander begins a new life with Mara and the Eloi, while Vox 114 helps him educate them.\n\nIn 1903, Philby and Mrs. Watchit, Alexander's housekeeper, are in his laboratory discussing his absence. Philby tells Mrs. Watchit he is glad that Alexander has gone to a place where he can find peace, then tells her that he would like to hire her as a housekeeper, which she accepts until Alexander returns. Mrs. Watchit bids Alexander farewell and Philby leaves, looking toward the laboratory affectionately, then throws his [[bowler hat]] away in tribute to Alexander's objection to conformity.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Guy Pearce]] as Dr. Alexander Hartdegen, [[associate professor]] of [[applied mechanics]] and [[engineering]] at [[Columbia University]].

The camera pulls out, traveling through New York City and then into space, past the [[International Space Station|ISS]], and ends with a [[space plane]] landing at the Moon to reveal Earth's future lunar colonies. Plants and buildings are shown springing up and then being replaced by new growth in a constant cycle. In later shots, the effects team used an erosion algorithm to digitally simulate the Earth's landscape changing through the centuries.<ref name=\"Robertson\" />\n\nFor some of the lighting effects used for the digital time bubble around the time machine, ILM developed an extended-range color format, which they named rgbe (red, green, blue, and an exponent channel) (See Paul E. Debevec and [[Jitendra Malik]], \"Recovering High Dynamic Range Radiance Maps from Photographs, Siggraph Proceedings, 1997).<ref name=\"Robertson\" />\n\nThe film's original release date was December 2001, but it was moved to March 2002 because they wanted to avoid competition with ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring]]'' and also a scene was removed from the Moon destruction sequence showing pieces of the Moon crashing into buildings in New York because it looked too similar visually to the [[September 11 attacks]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wtcinmovies.tripod.com/edits.html|title=WTC in Movies|first=Donna|last=Grunewald|website=wtcinmovies.tripod.com|access-date=2018-07-22|archive-date=2018-07-23|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180723003538/http://wtcinmovies.tripod.com/edits.html|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===Soundtrack===\nA [[The Time Machine (soundtrack)|full score]] was written by [[Klaus Badelt]], with the recognizable theme being the track \"I Don't Belong Here\", which was later used in the 2008 Discovery Channel Mini series ''[[When We Left Earth]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1233514/|title=When We Left Earth: The NASA Missions|via=www.imdb.com}}</ref>\n\nIn 2002, the film's soundtrack won the World Soundtrack Award for Discovery of the Year.\n\n==Reception==\n===Box office===\nThe film grossed $22 million at #1 during the opening weekend of March 8\u201310, 2002.
