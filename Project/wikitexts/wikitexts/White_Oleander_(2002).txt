The film stars [[Alison Lohman]] in the central role of Astrid Magnussen and [[Michelle Pfeiffer]] as her manipulative mother, Ingrid, with [[Robin Wright (actress)|Robin Wright]], [[Noah Wyle]] and [[Ren\u00e9e Zellweger]] in supporting roles. The screenplay was adapted from [[Janet Fitch]]'s 1999 novel ''[[White Oleander]]'', which was selected for [[Oprah's Book Club]] in May 1999.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.oprah.com/oprahsbookclub/white-oleander-by-janet-fitch_1|title=''White Oleander'' by Janet Fitch|website=Oprah's Book Club|access-date=October 31, 2022}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nAstrid Magnussen, 15, lives in [[Los Angeles]] with her free-spirited artist mother Ingrid. Too young to remember her father, she relies heavily upon her self-centered mother.\n\nIngrid's relationship with a writer, Barry ends when she discovers he is cheating. Murdering him with white [[oleander]] poison, Ingrid is incarcerated, leaving Astrid under social services' control.\n\nStarr Thomas, a former [[stripper]], recovering alcoholic and [[born-again Christian]] is Astrid's first foster mother. Initially interacting well, Astrid is baptised into her church. Ingrid finds out, setting Astrid against them. Believing Astrid is sleeping with Starr's live-in boyfriend Ray, she falls off the wagon. In a drunken rage, she argues with Ray, then shoots Astrid in the shoulder. Starr and Ray disappear; the children beg her not to report her, so Astrid plays along.\n\nAstrid recovers in a hospital before being moved to McKinney Children's Center (aka \"Mac\"). After fighting with some girls, she befriends fellow artist Paul Trout.\n\nAstrid is placed with former actress Claire Richards and her producer husband Mark. Fragile but affectionate, Claire bonds closely with Astrid, who finally thrives. One day, Astrid discovers Ingrid has been corresponding with Claire and insists on meeting. At the prison visit, Ingrid jealously exploits Claire's low self-esteem and suspicions over Mark's fidelity, which worsens her depression. Later, a bad fight with Mark makes Claire consider sending Astrid back. She begs her not to, she seems to recant, only to commit suicide that night, devastating Astrid.\n\nAstrid tells Ingrid of Claire's death, and that she was returned to Mac. Blaming her for the suicide, Astrid announces she won't visit again. In Mac, Paul tells Astrid that as he turns 18 soon he will move to New York. He asks her to join him but she coldly refuses.\n\nAstrid passes up good foster parent candidates for [[Russians|Russian]] [[immigrant]] Rena Gruschenka, who uses kids as laborers for her flea market business. With Rena she becomes colder and colder with her outward appearance matching her inside demeanor. Her mother's attorney Susan Vallares, charmed by her mother approaches Astrid, offering anything she wants in exchange for lying for her in court, as her mother has benefactors.\n\nAs Astrid refuses, Rena tells her she's stupid to turn down money. Rena offers to make her an equal partner in her business, saying she has nowhere better to go. When she balks at the idea, Rena tells her to use her mother like her mother wants to use her.\n\nAstrid surprises Ingrid one final time in prison. Now she has black hair, harsh makeup, and dark clothes. In control over her mother for once, Astrid demands answers about her past in exchange for testifying that Barry committed suicide. She hammers her with questions about Barry, her father, Claire, and Annie whom Astrid vaguely recalls from her toddler years.\n\nAnnie was a neighbor who kept Astrid for over a year while Ingrid went wild. Astrid's father came looking for her when she was 8, but she turned him away. Devastated by these revelations, Ingrid claims she would undo all she has done. Although Astrid begs her to not make her testify, she refuses.\n\nAstrid seeks letters from Paul from a comic book shop. He soon shows up in LA and they renew their relationship. He accompanies her to her mother's trial as she waits to testify. The courtroom empties and she goes to see what happened. Susan explains that Ingrid instructed her to not include Astrid's testimony. Ingrid and Astrid stare at one another as she is led away. Gutted, Astrid watches as her mother is taken back to prison. Paul asks what happened, and she says her mother finally let her go.\n\nTwo years later, a blond-again Astrid lives in [[NYC]] with Paul, tending to her art: dioramas in suitcases depicting her life up to that point. As she passes them, she closes each, stating she will never visit the horrors they contain again. Pausing at the final one depicting Ingrid, Astrid reflects that, although flawed, she knows her mother loves her.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Alison Lohman]] as Astrid Magnussen\n*[[Robin Wright]] as Starr Thomas\n*[[Michelle Pfeiffer]] as Ingrid Magnussen\n*[[Ren\u00e9e Zellweger]] as Claire Richards\n*[[Billy Connolly]] as Barry Kolker\n*Svetlana Efremova as Rena Gruschenka\n*[[Patrick Fugit]] as Paul Trout\n*[[Cole Hauser]] as Ray\n*[[Noah Wyle]] as Mark Richards\n*[[Amy Aquino]] as Ms. Martinez\n*Liz Stauber as Carolee\n\n==Production==\n[[Barbra Streisand]] turned down offers to direct the film and play Ingrid Magnussen.\n\n[[Alison Lohman]] wore a wig throughout filming because she had just finished playing a cancer patient in deleted scenes from the film ''[[Dragonfly (2002 film)|Dragonfly]]'' (2002).\n\nThe film clip Claire ([[Ren\u00e9e Zellweger]]) shows Astrid as an example of her acting career is of Zellweger's own early performance in ''[[The Return of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre]]'' (1994).\n\n==Release==\n===Reception===\n''White Oleander'' holds a rating of 70% on [[Rotten Tomatoes]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/white_oleander|title=''White Oleander'' Movie Reviews, Pictures|website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|publisher=[[Flixster]]|access-date=October 31, 2022}}</ref> and a score of 61 on [[Metacritic]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.metacritic.com/movie/white-oleander |title=White Oleander reviews at Metacritic.com |website=[[Metacritic]]|publisher=[[CBS Interactive]]|access-date=October 31, 2022}}</ref> indicating generally favorable reviews.\n\n[[Stephen Holden]], writing for ''[[The New York Times]]'', called it a \"rich, turbulent adaptation,\" and described the performances as \"superbly acted from top to bottom.\" Comparing it to other films on the same theme \u2013 ''[[Anywhere but Here (film)|Anywhere but Here]]'' (1999), ''[[Tumbleweeds (1999 film)|Tumbleweeds]]'' (1999), and ''[[The Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood (film)|The Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood]]'' (2002) \u2013 Holden found ''White Oleander'' to be the only one to show \"how children instinctively absorb their parents' attitudes and personalities.\"<ref name=holden>{{cite news|first=Stephen|last=Holden|authorlink=Stephen Holden|title=Movie Review \u2013 'White Oleander' \u2013 Slowly, a Princess Turns Into an Urchin|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=October 11, 2002|p=13}}</ref> [[Andrew Sarris]], writing for ''The Observer'', named it as a runner-up on his list of the ten best English-language films of 2002.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://observer.com/2003/01/the-best-films-of-2002-and-a-few-honorable-mentions/|first=Andrew|last=Sarris|title=The Best Films of 2002, and a few Honorable Mentions |newspaper=[[observer.com|The Observer]]|access-date=October 31, 2022}}</ref> [[Roger Ebert]], writing for the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'', was critical of the film, writing, \"The performances are often touching and deserve a better screenplay.\"<ref name=ebert>{{cite news|url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/white-oleander-2002|first=Roger|last=Ebert|title=White Oleander|newspaper=Chicago Sun Times|date=October 11, 2002|access-date=October 31, 2022}}</ref>\n\nThe performances were widely acclaimed, particularly those of Pfeiffer and Lohman.
