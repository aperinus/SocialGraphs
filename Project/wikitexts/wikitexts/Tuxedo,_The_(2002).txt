It is a spy [[parody]] that involves a special [[tuxedo]] that grants its wearer special abilities. It also involves a corporate terrorist, threatening to poison the United States' fresh water supply with bacteria that spills [[electrolyte]]s into the blood and totally dehydrates the host.<ref name=\"Hart\" />\n\nThe film received negative reviews from [[critics]] upon release and earned a total worldwide box office gross of $104.4 million.<ref name=\"mojo\" />\n\n== Plot ==\nJames \"Jimmy\" Tong is a taxi driver notorious for his speed and ability to get his customers anywhere in the least amount of time. His reputation lands him a job as the personal [[chauffeur]] of the mysterious but wealthy Clark Devlin. Jimmy does not really know what his new boss' job is, but Devlin's friendly nature, imperturbable demeanor, and willingness to offer Jimmy advice wins Jimmy over and the two become friends. What Jimmy does not realize is that Devlin is a secret [[Espionage|spy]] and undercover government agent, and when an attempt to kill Devlin with a car bombing sends him into a coma, Jimmy ends up with Devlin's recent case notes and a special watch that controls Devlin's rather unusual tuxedo.\n\nThe tuxedo is a [[E-textiles|gadget capable of granting its wearer special abilities]] (including [[martial arts]], [[speed]], the ability to dance, and various [[acrobatics]]) which Jimmy must use to stop the criminal organization responsible for Devlin's attempted murder. The group is a terrorist organization disguised as a corporation named Banning Corporation and is headed by the notorious and ruthless Dietrich Banning. Its goal is to take over the global drinking water supply, starting with the poisoning of major US reservoirs by means of genetically modified [[gerridae|water strider]] insects. These water striders have bacteria that can spread from person to person, causing severe dehydration. By pure chance, Jimmy is joined by a genius scientist with aspirations of field work, Delilah \"Del\" Blaine. Blaine is completely new to field work and is delighted to be on assignment with Devlin, only to be very confused by Jimmy as he impersonates Devlin, relying on the tuxedo's special abilities to compensate for his lack of skill and training.\n\nAt first, Blaine thinks Jimmy is weird and annoying, and then a fraud when Jimmy's impersonation is finally exposed. She confiscates his borrowed tuxedo and attempts to stop the evil Dietrich Banning on her own by feigning a desire to become a turncoat for Banning Corporation. Meanwhile, Jimmy is ready to give up and go back to his life as a taxi driver, but while packing his belongings he discovers that Devlin had ordered a second suit for Jimmy himself, believing that Jimmy could also be a great agent. Using his new suit, Jimmy defeats the [[villain]], Banning, by putting a cigarette in Blaine's mouth. Banning's tuxedo automatically forces him to pull out a lighter and light her cigarette. While Blaine is (comically) puffing on the lit cigarette, Jimmy begins to punch Banning. During the fight, Jimmy throws a glass containing the queen of the water striders into Banning's mouth. He is then infected with bacteria from the water strider. The other remaining water striders attack Banning and he then dies instantaneously.\n\nAs compensation for his role in bringing down Banning, the organization uses its resources to orchestrate an operation so that Jimmy can finally meet his dream girl. However, confused by Blaine's and the now-recovered Devlin's conflicting instructions on how to act Jimmy succeeds only in alarming the girl into threatening to mace him, resulting in the operation being aborted. Consoling Jimmy afterwards, Blaine admits feeling sad that no one had ever tried to do for her what Jimmy had just done, and Jimmy tells Blaine that she has to change and be more accommodating if she ever wants to have a boyfriend. Feeling a tentative attraction for each other, they walk away to buy coffee together.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Jackie Chan]] as James \"Jimmy\" Tong / Clark Devlin\n* [[Jennifer Love Hewitt]] as CSA Agent Delilah \"Del\" Blaine\n* [[Jason Isaacs]] as CSA Agent Clark Devlin / Brad Dillford (Inspired by [[Ian Fleming]]'s [[James Bond (literary character)|James Bond]])\n* [[Debi Mazar]] as CSA Agent Steena\n* [[Ritchie Coster]] as Dietrich Banning\n* [[Peter Stormare]] as Dr. Simms\n* Mia Cottet as Cheryl\n* [[Romany Malco]] as Mitch\n* [[Daniel Kash]] as Rogers\n* Jody Racicot as Kells\n* [[Boyd Banks]] as Vic\n* [[Bob Balaban]] as CSA Director Winton Chalmers (''uncredited'')\n* [[Christian Potenza]] as CSA Agent Joel\n* Scott Wickware as CSA Agent Wallace\n* Karen Glave as CSA Agent Randa\n* [[Scott Yaphe]] as CSA Agent Gabe\n* Jordan Madley as Holly \n* [[James Brown]] as himself \n* [[Colin Mochrie]] as Gallery Owner\n* [[Noah Danby]] as Bike Messenger\n* [[Kim Roberts (actress)|Kim Roberts]] as ER Nurse\n\n== Production ==\nJackie Chan was unsure about the project adding special effects together with stunts, but was interested to work with DreamWorks for the chance to meet Steven Spielberg.<ref name=\"Hart\">{{cite news|title= His Career Is No Stunt|work= [[Los Angeles Times]] |date=September 8, 2002|url= http://articles.latimes.com/2002/sep/08/entertainment/ca-hart8|access-date=2010-10-23|first=Hugh|last=Hart}}</ref> Chan found the American approach to stunts and safety restrictive and wanted to repeat a jump but was not allowed. \"American films are different -- it drives me crazy,\" said Chan.<ref>{{cite web |date=24 September 2002 |last=Curiel |first=Jonathan |title=Man of action / Jackie Chan suits up for 'Tuxedo,' finds Hollywood reluctant to let him do the stunts |url=https://www.sfgate.com/entertainment/article/Man-of-action-Jackie-Chan-suits-up-for-2793061.php |website=SFGate }}</ref> On her first day of stunts, Jennifer Love Hewitt suffered a broken finger after being struck by one of the stunt men.<ref name=\"tvguide\">{{cite web |date=October 1, 2002 |author=Daniel R.
