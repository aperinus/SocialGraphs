It is loosely based on the life and career of [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] and film star and comedienne [[Fanny Brice]] and her stormy relationship with entrepreneur and gambler [[Nicky Arnstein]].\n\nProduced by Brice's son-in-law, [[Ray Stark]] (and the first film by his company [[Rastar]]), with music and lyrics by [[Jule Styne]] and [[Bob Merrill]], the film stars [[Barbra Streisand]] (in her film debut reprising her Broadway role) as Brice and [[Omar Sharif]] as Arnstein, with a supporting cast featuring [[Kay Medford]], [[Anne Francis]], [[Walter Pidgeon]], Lee Allen and [[Mae Questel]].\n\nA major critical and commercial success, ''Funny Girl'' became [[1968 in film|the highest-grossing film of 1968 in the United States]] and received eight [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nominations. Streisand won [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]], tying with [[Katharine Hepburn]] (''[[The Lion in Winter (1968 film)|The Lion in Winter]]''). In 2006, the [[American Film Institute]] ranked the film #16 on its list commemorating [[AFI's Greatest Movie Musicals]]. Previously it had ranked the film #41 in its 2002 list of [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Passions]], the songs \"[[People (Barbra Streisand song)|People]]\" and \"[[Don't Rain on My Parade]]\" at #13 and #46, respectively, in its 2004 list of [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Songs]], and the line \"Hello, gorgeous\" at #81 in its 2005 list of [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Movie Quotes]].

Her mother and her friend Mrs. Strakosh try to dissuade her from show business because Fanny is not the typical beauty (\"If a Girl Isn't Pretty\"). While rehearsing at a vaudeville theater, the boss complains about Fanny's unsynchronized performance and her appearance. Upon his decision to sack her, she perseveres (\"I'm the Greatest Star\"). With Eddie's help and encouragement, Fanny is given a part in a roller-skating act despite lacking roller-skating skills. Although the act turns into a big mess, the audience find it to be hilarious and cheer her (\"Rollerskate Rag\"). Fanny has her first performance, \"I'd Rather Be Blue Over You (Than Happy With Somebody Else)\". Following the debut, she meets the suave Nicky. Six months later, Fanny is hired to become a member of the ''Ziegfeld Follies'' \u2013 something she has always dreamt of. In the debut performance, she adds a comic twist to the supposedly romantic number, ending the number as a pregnant bride (\"His Love Makes Me Beautiful\"), which nearly results in Fanny getting fired from the ''Follies'', until the members of the Brice family come backstage to compliment her for her comic acts, which causes Ziegfeld to change his mind, telling her to do the same thing she did for every future performance. She meets Arnstein again, who accompanies her to the celebration at her home on Henry Street (\"People\").\n\nOne year later, Fanny is now the rising star of Broadway. She and Nicky meet again when she travels to Baltimore as a part of her tour. After having a romantic dinner at a swanky restaurant and declaring their feelings (\"You Are Woman, I Am Man\"), the pair become romantically involved. Instead of going to Chicago with the ''Follies'', Fanny decides to take another train to New York in order to be with Nicky (\"Don't Rain on My Parade\"). While traveling aboard the [[SS Imperator#Cunard service as Berengaria|RMS ''Berengaria'']], Nicky promises that if he could win a fortune by playing [[poker]], then they could get married, which eventually comes true. They move into a mansion and have a daughter (\"Sadie, Sadie\"). Meanwhile, Fanny returns to Ziegfeld and the ''Follies''.\n\nNicky's various business ventures fail, causing him to lose a lot of money. Nicky being busy gambling and not showing up to Fanny's new play premiere (\"Swan\") makes her upset and the two have an argument. Fanny's mother, who has known about Nicky's corruption, advises Fanny to \"love him less\" and to \"help him more\". Refusing financial support from his wife, he becomes involved in a bonds scam and he gets caught by the authorities. Fanny receives the news about the imprisonment from Ziegfeld, who advises her not to leave the theater and go to court, which she resists, leaving the theater. At a court hearing, Nicky refuses to answer the charges, and is imprisoned for [[embezzlement]] for eighteen months. At the moment of the farewell, Nicky calling her \"Funny Girl\" leaves her feeling bitter (\"Funny Girl\"). Following Nick's release from prison, they agree to separate. She is heartbroken and claims that \"I am his forever more\" (\"My Man\").\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Barbra Streisand]] as [[Fanny Brice]]\n* [[Omar Sharif]] as [[Nicky Arnstein]]\n* [[Kay Medford]] as Rose Brice\n* [[Anne Francis]] as Georgia James\n* [[Walter Pidgeon]] as [[Florenz Ziegfeld Jr.|Florenz Ziegfeld]]\n* Lee Allen as Eddie Ryan\n* [[Mae Questel]] as Mrs. Strakosh\n* [[Gerald Mohr]] as Branca\n* [[Frank Faylen]] as Keeney\n* [[Mittie Lawrence]] as Emma\n* [[Gertrude Flynn]] as Mrs. O'Malley\n* [[Penny Santon]] as Mrs. Meeker\n* [[John Harmon (actor)|John Harmon]] as company manager\n* [[Ruth Clifford]] as maid (uncredited)\n}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\n[[File:Fannybricebain.jpg|thumb|right|170px|The film is based on the life and love story of Fanny Brice.|alt=]]\n[[Isobel Lennart]] originally wrote ''Funny Girl'' as a screenplay for a [[Drama (film and television)|drama film]] entitled ''My Man'' for producer [[Ray Stark]] (whose mother-in-law was Fanny Brice).

After working on pre-production for six months, he left the project due to \"creative differences\" and was replaced by [[William Wyler]], whose long and illustrious award-winning career never had included a musical film; he originally was assigned to direct ''[[The Sound of Music (film)|The Sound of Music]]''. Wyler initially declined Stark's offer because he was concerned his significant hearing loss would affect his ability to work on a musical. After giving it some thought, he told Stark, \"If [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]] could write his ''[[Symphony No. 3 (Beethoven)|Eroica Symphony]]'', then William Wyler can do a musical.\"<ref name=TCM />\n\nStreisand had never heard of Wyler, and when she was told he had won the [[Academy Award for Best Director]] for ''[[Ben-Hur (1959 film)|Ben-Hur]]'', she commented, \"Chariots! How is he with people, like women? Is he any good with actresses?\" In fact Wyler had directed ''[[Roman Holiday]]'' (1953) which won three Academy Awards including the Best Actress award for [[Audrey Hepburn]] who had been chosen by Wyler despite her relative obscurity at that time. As for Wyler, he said, \"I wouldn't have done the picture without her.\" Her enthusiasm reminded him of [[Bette Davis]], and he felt she \"represented a challenge for me because she's never been in films, and she's not the usual glamour girl\".<ref name=TCM />\n\n===Casting===\n[[File:MyMan.jpg|thumb|In the film's finale, Streisand sings \"My Man\", a tune closely associated with Fanny Brice|alt=]]\nStyne wanted [[Frank Sinatra]] for the role of Nicky Arnstein, but the actor was willing to appear in the film only if the role was expanded and new songs were added for the character.

[[Egypt]]ian [[Omar Sharif]] was cast to star opposite the Jewish Streisand after Wyler noticed him having lunch in the studio commissary. When the [[Six-Day War]] between [[Israel]] and [[Egypt]] broke out, studio executives considered replacing Sharif, but both Wyler and Streisand threatened to quit if they did. Later, the publication of a still depicting a love scene between Fanny and Nicky in the Egyptian press prompted a movement to revoke Sharif's citizenship. When asked about the controversy, Streisand replied, \"You think Cairo got upset? You should see the letter I got from my Aunt Rose!\"<ref name=TCM /> Anne Francis was cast in a new role as the lead chorine in the Ziegfeld Follies.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=yHlYAAAAIBAJ&pg=3281,4732147 |title= \"Honey West\" now in \"Funny Girl\"|first= Vernon|last= Scott|work= [[The News-Dispatch]] |date= August 25, 1967|access-date=October 14, 2013|via=[[Google News]]}}</ref>\n\nChoreographer [[Herbert Ross]], who staged the musical numbers, had worked with Streisand in ''[[I Can Get It for You Wholesale]]'', her Broadway debut.<ref name=TCM />\n\n===Filming===\n{|class=\"toccolours\" style=\"float: right; margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 2em; font-size: 85%; background:#white; color:black; width:30em; max-width: 40%;\" cellspacing=\"5\"\n|style=\"text-align: left;\"|It doesn't matter how much expensive gear you've got, you need to have not a little luck, a great deal of skill, and a telepathic relationship between pilot and cameraman to pull that off.

Streisand's first scene took place at an abandoned rail depot in New Jersey where she just got off from the train and posing for the photographers. Filming was more difficult for Barbra than she thought because she had to do a musical numbers multiple times for different camera angles. For the helicopter shot of \"Don't Rain on My Parade\", aerial photographer Nelson Tyler had to develop a special helicopter camera rig.<ref name=\"archive\"/> Streisand allegedly had so many of her scenes with [[Anne Francis]] cut before the film's release that Francis sued to have her name removed from the credits, but lost.<ref name=TCM /> Streisand later claimed she never told Wyler to cut anything and the final film reflected his choices, not hers. Francis later said \"I have no feud with Barbra. But doing that film was like ''[[Gaslight (1944 film)|Gaslight]]''.

The line was also uttered by the character [[Max Bialystock]] in the 1967 film ''[[The Producers (1967 film)|The Producers]]'' and [[The Producers (musical)|its Broadway adaptation]], but the inflection used by [[Zero Mostel]] is different from that used by Streisand.
