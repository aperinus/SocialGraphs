It is directed by [[Mikael H\u00e5fstr\u00f6m]] and stars [[John Cusack]] and [[Samuel L. Jackson]]. The film was released in the United States on June 22, 2007.\n\nThe film follows Mike Enslin, an author who investigates allegedly [[haunted house]]s and rents the titular room 1408 at a [[New York City]] hotel. Although skeptical of the [[paranormal]], he is soon trapped in the room where he experiences bizarre events. Reviews were mostly positive and the film performed positively at the box office.\n\n==Plot==\nMike Enslin is a [[Cynicism (contemporary)|cynical]] and [[Skepticism|skeptical]] author of niche books debunking supernatural events, in which he has no belief. While promoting his latest book, he receives an anonymous postcard depicting The Dolphin, a hotel on [[Lexington Avenue]] in [[New York City]], bearing the message: \"Don't enter 1408.\" Viewing this as a challenge, Mike travels to The Dolphin and requests room 1408. The [[hotel manager]], Gerald Olin, attempts to discourage him. He explains to Mike that in the last 95 years, no one has lasted more than an hour inside of 1408; the latest count is 56 deaths. Olin attempts to dissuade and even bribe Mike, but at Mike's insistence and threat of legal action against the hotel, preparations are reluctantly made.\n\nWhile Mike describes the room's boring appearance and absence of supernatural behavior on his [[mini-cassette]] recorder, the clock radio suddenly starts playing [[The Carpenters]]' \"[[We've Only Just Begun]]\", and the digital display changes to a countdown starting from 60:00. Mike begins to see ghosts of the room's past victims, along with flashbacks of his deceased daughter Katie and his terminally ill father. Mike makes numerous attempts to leave the room, all in vain. As the temperature in the room starts to rapidly increase, Mike uses his laptop to contact his estranged wife Lily and ask for help. The heat activates the sprinkler system, short circuiting the laptop, which starts to work again when the temperature drops to subzero. A [[doppelg\u00e4nger]] of Mike appears in a video chat window, urging Lily to come to the hotel room herself and giving Mike a sly wink.\n\nThe room starts to shake violently, causing Mike to crash into a picture of a ship in a storm, from which water floods the room. He finds himself reliving a surfing accident from before he entered the room. Recovering in hospital, he reconciles with Lily and assumes his experience in 1408 was just a nightmare; Lily encourages him to write a book about it. When visiting the post office to send the manuscript to his publisher, he recognizes members of a construction crew as Dolphin Hotel staff, who start destroying the walls, revealing that Mike is still trapped inside 1408. Katie's ghost confronts him, and when the countdown ends, the room restores itself and the clock radio resets to 60:00.\n\nA female voice calling herself \"hotel operator\" calls Mike. Mike asks why he has not been killed yet and she informs him that guests enjoy free will: he can relive the past hour over and over again, or use their \"express checkout system\". A [[hangman's noose]] appears, but he refuses to give in. Mike improvises a [[Molotov cocktail]] and sets the room on fire. He then lies down and laughs in victory upon destroying the room. The hotel is evacuated and Olin, in his office, praises Mike for his actions.\n\n===Endings===\nThere are four endings to this film. In addition to the ending that appears in the theatrical release (also the default ending of the DVD), three other alternative endings were shot. The incentive for this was based on the director's belief that King's intention, in his original short story, was to leave the conclusion ambiguous. None of the four endings matches the ending of King's original short story.\n\n====Theatrical====\nThis is the default ending of the theatrical release and its theatrical release DVD. It is also used on the Amazon Prime, Netflix UK, and the YouTube Movies version of the film.\n\nMike survives and he and Lily reconcile, though Lily is skeptical of his experience. She finds a box of Mike's possessions that were rescued from 1408 and Mike takes the damaged mini-cassette recorder from it, saying, \"Sometimes you can't get rid of bad memories. You've just got to live with them.\" Mike briefly tampers with the recorder, making it work again. Suddenly, they hear Katie's voice coming from it, confirming Mike's account.\n\nAn alternate version of this ending has the same events but Lily does not acknowledge hearing Katie's voice on the tape and only Mike's reaction is shown.\n\n====Director's cut====\nDirector [[Mikael H\u00e5fstr\u00f6m]] said that the ending for ''1408'' was reshot because test audiences felt that the original ending was too much of a \"downer.\"<ref>[https://www.cinemablend.com/dvdnews/Advance-Hint-At-1408-DVD-Contents-4676.html Advance Hint At 1408 DVD Contents] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171010211349/https://www.cinemablend.com/dvdnews/Advance-Hint-At-1408-DVD-Contents-4676.html |date=2017-10-10 }}, ''DVD News''.</ref>\n\nThe original discarded ending had Mike dying in the fire, but happy to see the room destroyed. He spitefully laughs as the room screams in agony, and everything burns and crashes on top of him. At Mike's funeral, Olin approaches Lily and Mike's publisher Sam Farrell. He unsuccessfully attempts to give her a box of Mike's possessions, including the tape recorder. Olin claims that the room was successfully destroyed and that it will no longer hurt anyone else. He later listens to the recording in his car and becomes upset when he hears Katie's voice on the tape. He sees a little girl in a dress walking on the cemetery grass behind the car, calling out as if she is lost. He then sees Mike's burnt corpse in the backseat. Then he sees the same girl holding hands with her father as they walk away. Olin places the tape recorder back in the box and drives off. The final scene is of the gutted room, where an apparition of Mike assesses the death of the entity while smoking a cigarette. He hears his daughter calling for him and disappears as he walks towards the door. A door is heard closing and the scene fades.\n\nThis ending is the default ending on the Blu-ray release and two-disc collector's edition. Canadian networks [[Space (Canadian TV channel)|Space]] and [[The Movie Network]], and U.S. network FX broadcast this version of the film. Space broadcast the theatrical ending on July 23, 2012. This ending is also used on the U.K. and Australian DVDs, and the U.S. iTunes and Netflix versions of the film.\n\n====Other====\nMike dies in the fire. Instead of the funeral scene from the director's cut, the sounds of a funeral are dubbed over shots of [[Los Angeles]]. Lily and Sam sort through Mike's effects. Sam returns to his New York office and discovers the manuscript that Mike wrote while he was in room 1408. As Sam reads the story, audio from Mike's experiences in the room is heard. In a final scene, Sam's office doors slam shut and Mike's father's voice says, \"As I was, you are. As I am, you will be.\"\n\n==Cast==\n* [[John Cusack]] as Michael \"Mike\" Enslin\n* [[Samuel L.

Mick LaSalle of the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' wrote a very positive review, describing the film as \"one of the good Stephen King adaptations, one that maintains its author's sly sense of humor and satiric view of human nature\". He ultimately believed the film to be a \"more genuinely scary movie than most horror films\".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.sfgate.com/movies/article/Checkout-time-Much-sooner-than-you-think-2555033.php|title=Checkout time?

Wesley Morris of ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' wrote a mixed review, describing the film as \"a lot of consonants and no vowels.\" He went on to compare the film unfavorably to ''[[The Shining (film)|The Shining]]'', a similar King adaptation, believing ''1408'' lacked that film's \"lunging horror and dramatic architecture.\" Although he believed the film \"conjures a wonderful anticipatory mood of dread in the first 30 minutes,\" he ultimately believed the film \"then blows it to stylish smithereens\".<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.boston.com/movies/display?display=movie&id=9186 | work=The Boston Globe | title=As thrillers go, '1408' leaves too much room for fun | first=Wesley | last=Morris | date=2007-06-22| access-date= 13 May 2008 <!--Added by DASHBot-->}}</ref> Rob Salem of the ''[[Toronto Star]]'' awarded the film two stars out of four, believing it to be a predictable, \"hit and miss\" production.
