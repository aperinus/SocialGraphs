It is named after the song [[Takin' Care of Business (song)|of the same name]] by [[Randy Bachman]], recorded by the Canadian rock group [[Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive]] (BTO). The film is also known for being the first screenplay work written by [[J. J. Abrams]], who later went on to make several blockbuster films, including ''[[Super 8 (2011 film)|Super 8]]'' and ''[[Star Wars: The Force Awakens]]''.\n\n==Plot==\nA convicted car thief and diehard [[Chicago Cubs]] fan, Jimmy Dworski (Belushi) wins tickets to the [[World Series]]. Unfortunately, he still has a couple of days left to serve in [[prison]] and the warden, Frank Toolman ([[H\u00e9ctor Elizondo]]), will not let him leave and come back. With the help of other inmates, Jimmy stages a [[riot]] so he can sneak out of prison to see the game. On the way, he finds the [[Filofax]] of uptight and spineless advertising executive Spencer Barnes (Grodin), which promises a reward if it is found.\n\nOver the next day, Jimmy takes on Barnes' identity\u2014staying in the [[Malibu, California|Malibu]] [[beach house]] of Spencer's boss, flirting with the boss's daughter, even taking a meeting with a powerful [[Japan]]ese food company [[Business magnate|magnate]] named Sakamoto ([[Mako Iwamatsu]]). The fake \"Spencer\"'s unorthodox methods, such as beating the magnate at tennis and telling him about the poor quality of his food products, gets the attention of the taken aback Sakamoto. However his unconventional negotiations with the food company insult some of the executives, seemingly ruining Spencer's reputation.\n\nMeanwhile, lacking his precious Filofax, the real Spencer Barnes is spiraling into the gutter. Losing all his clothes, his car and money, he has to rely on an old high school flame, the [[Neuroticism|neurotic]] and overbearing Debbie Lipton (Anne De Salvo) who keeps trying to rekindle a relationship with him.\n\nFinally Jimmy and Spencer come together at a meeting with the advertising executives, where Spencer is sacked by his boss. As a consolation Jimmy takes Spencer to the World Series, where Jimmy makes a spectacular catch on a home-run ball hit by [[Mark Grace]], who makes a cameo.\n\nWhen security goes after Jimmy, who was spotted on the [[Jumbotron]], they escape by using Spencer's Filofax to slide down a support wire and out of the stadium. Spencer patches up his marriage with his wife, who had become exasperated with his overworking. Jimmy sneaks back into prison with Spencer's help, serves his last couple of hours and is released, only to find Spencer waiting to pick him up. With the promise of a beautiful girlfriend and a well-paying job in advertising work with Spencer, Jimmy's future looks bright, as does that of his beloved Cubs, who won the World Series.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Jim Belushi|James Belushi]] as Jimmy Dworski / Spencer Barnes\n* [[Charles Grodin]] as Spencer Barnes\n* [[Mako Iwamatsu|Mako]] as Mr. Sakamoto\n* [[H\u00e9ctor Elizondo]] as Warden Frank Toolman\n* [[Veronica Hamel]] as Elizabeth Barnes\n* [[Stephen Elliott (actor)|Stephen Elliott]] as Walter Bentley\n* [[Loryn Locklin]] as Jewel Bentley\n* [[John de Lancie]] as Ted Bradford Jr.\n* [[Gates McFadden]] as Diane Connors\n* Anne De Salvo as Debbie Lipton\n* [[Andre Rosey Brown]] as \"Heavy G\"\n* Burke Byrnes as Prison Guard\n\n==Reception==\nThe film received negative reviews, with Caryn James of ''The New York Times'' labeling it as a film that \"plays it safe and boring.\"<ref>{{cite news |last=James |first=Caryn |date=August 17, 1990 |title=Review/Film; An Adman, His Filofax and a Thief |url=https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9C0CE3D7123EF934A2575BC0A966958260 |work=[[The New York Times]] |access-date=July 27, 2017 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Wilmington |first=Michael |date=August 17, 1990 |title=MOVIE REVIEW: 'Taking Care of Business' Is Bankrupt of Laughter |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1990-08-17/entertainment/ca-521_1_movies-business-care |access-date=July 27, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Kempley |first=Rita|date=August 17, 1990 |title='Taking Care of Business' (R) |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/style/longterm/movies/videos/takingcareofbusinessrkempley_a0a094.htm  |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |access-date=July 27, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Gleiberman |first=Owen |date=August 31, 1990 |title=Taking Care of Business |url=http://ew.com/article/1990/08/31/taking-care-business-2/ |work=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |quote=We gave it a '''D''' |access-date=July 27, 2017}} (emphasis in the original).</ref><ref>{{Cite magazine |last=Novak |first=Ralph |title=Picks and Pans Review: Taking Care of Business |date=September 10, 1990 |url=http://people.com/archive/picks-and-pans-review-taking-care-of-business-vol-34-no-10/feed/ |magazine=[[People (magazine)|People]] |volume=34 |issue=10 |access-date=July 27, 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reported that 29% of critics have given the film a positive review based on 14 reviews, with an average rating of 3.14/10.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/taking_care_of_business |title=Taking Care of Business (1990) |website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |publisher=[[Fandango Media|Fandango]] |access-date=January 1, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Production==\nBaseball scenes for ''Taking Care of Business'' were filmed at [[Angel Stadium of Anaheim]] in [[California]].\n\nThe film grossed $20 million in the United States.\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of American films of 1990]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|id=0103035|title=Taking Care of Business}}\n* {{Mojo title|takingcareofbusiness|Taking Care of Business}}\n* {{rotten-tomatoes|taking_care_of_business|Taking Care of Business}}\n\n{{Chicago Cubs}}\n{{Arthur Hiller}}\n{{J.
