Romero]] and written by [[Stephen King]], making this film his screenwriting debut. The film's [[ensemble cast]] includes [[Hal Holbrook]], [[Adrienne Barbeau]], [[Fritz Weaver]], [[Leslie Nielsen]], [[Carrie Nye]], [[E. G. Marshall]], and [[Viveca Lindfors]] as well as King himself (King's acting debut actually came a year prior in the Romero film ''[[Knightriders]]''). The film was primarily shot on location in [[Pittsburgh]] and its suburbs, including Monroeville, where Romero leased an old boys academy (Penn Hall) to build extensive sets for the film.\n\n''Creepshow'' consists of five short stories: \"Father's Day\", \"The Lonesome Death of Jordy Verrill\" (based on the King short story \"[[Weeds (short story)|Weeds]]\"), \"Something to Tide You Over\", \"[[The Crate]]\" and \"They're Creeping Up on You!\" Two of these stories were adapted from King's short stories, with the film bookended by prologue and epilogue scenes featuring a young boy named Billy (played by King's son, [[Joe Hill (writer)|Joe]]), who is punished by his abusive father for reading [[horror comics]].\n\n''Creepshow'' is an [[Homage (arts)|homage]] to the [[EC Comics|EC]] horror comics of the 1950s, such as ''[[Tales from the Crypt (comics)|Tales from the Crypt]]'', ''[[The Vault of Horror (comics)|The Vault of Horror]]'' and ''[[The Haunt of Fear]]''. In order for the film to give viewers a comic book feel, Romero hired long-time effects specialist [[Tom Savini]] to replicate comic-like effects.\n\nThe film earned $21 million in the United States.<ref>{{cite web | title=Creepshow (1982) | url=https://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=creepshow.htm | publisher=[[Box Office Mojo]]|date=1982-12-28 | access-date=2016-01-22}}</ref> It was followed by a 1987 [[sequel]], ''[[Creepshow 2]]'', directed by the first film's cinematographer, [[:it:Michael Gornick|Michael Gornick]], written by Romero and based on stories by King. A second sequel, ''[[Creepshow 3]]'', was released in 2006, without involvement from either Romero or King.\n\n==Plot==\n===Prologue===\nBilly Hopkins, a young boy, gets disciplined by his abusive father Stan for reading a ''Creepshow'', a horror comic. Not wanting his son to be exposed to the comic's content, Stan throws it in the garbage. As Billy sits upstairs, wishing that his father rots in [[Hell]], he hears a sound at the window.\n\nThe source of the noise turns out to be the Creep, the host of the comic book, who beckons him to come closer and removes the trash can's lid.\n\n===\"Father's Day\"===\nSylvia Grantham meets her nephew Richard and niece Cass, along with Cass's new husband Hank at the Grantham estate for the family's annual dinner on the third Sunday in June. They proceed to tell Hank about the family matriarch, Great Aunt Bedelia, and of how it is an open secret in the family that she murdered her late father: the miserly and domineering Nathan Grantham who had accumulated the family's fortune through [[Rum-running|bootlegging]], [[fraud]], [[extortion]], and [[Contract killing|murder-for-hire]].\n\nMany years earlier, Bedelia was rendered an unstable [[spinster]], the result of a lifetime spent putting up with her father's incessant demands and [[emotional abuse]], which got even worse after he suffered a stroke and she was made to nurse him full-time. The torture culminated with Nathan orchestrating a fatal \"hunting accident\", which took the life of his daughter's fianc\u00e9 Peter Yarbro, in order to keep her under his thumb. That [[Father's Day]], Bedelia, driven into a murderous rage by Nathan's constant insults and his petulant demands for his cake, bashed her overbearing father's head in with a marble ashtray (that is hidden throughout the other stories).\n\nIn the present day, Bedelia arrives at Grantham Manor that evening. She stops by the family cemetery, just outside the mansion, to lay a flower at her father's grave. She drunkenly reminisces about the murder, and reveals that Sylvia staged the killing as an accident in order to steal and distribute Nathan's fortune among the rest of the family. She accidentally spills her whiskey bottle in front of the headstone. Just then, Nathan's reanimated, putrefied, maggot-infested corpse emerges from the burial plot, still demanding the Father's Day cake he never got. He avenges himself on Bedelia, strangling her. He proceeds to systematically wipe out the rest of his family: telekinetically crushing Hank to death with a gravestone, then twisting Sylvia's neck; he also kills Mrs. Danvers, the Granthams' [[Cook (domestic worker)|cook]], possibly to cover his tracks. As a gruesome final joke, Nathan surprises Cass and Richard by presenting them with his Father's Day cake: Sylvia's severed head, covered with frosting and lit candles.\n\nWhile the ending is left ambiguous in the film, with Nathan gloating over a terrified Cass and Richard in freeze-frame, the [[Creepshow (comics)|comic book based on the film]] has the Creep giving a vague hint that Nathan's next act was to \"blow out their candles\".\n\n===\"The Lonesome Death of Jordy Verrill\"===\nJordy Verrill, a comedic and dim-witted backwoods yokel, watches as a [[meteorite]] crash lands on his farm. Observing the crash site, Jordy gets his fingers burned when he tries to touch the meteorite. In a fantasy sequence, Jordy imagines selling the meteorite to the local college's \"Department of Meteors\", hoping that the sale will provide enough money to pay off a $200 bank loan. Taking precautions, he douses the meteorite with a bucket of water, causing it to crack open and spill a glowing blue liquid. In another fantasy sequence, Jordy imagines the \"Department of Meteors\" refusing to purchase the now broken meteorite. Resolving to try and glue the halves together in the morning, Jordy nonchalantly dumps the liquid inside the meteor into the soil, but not before the substance makes contact with his skin.\n\nAs time passes, Jordy finds his fingers being overcome by what appears to be grass. He attempts to call a doctor, but he reconsiders doing so when he imagines (in another fantasy sequence) that the doctor will chop the afflicted fingers off without [[anesthetic]]. Over time, the strange substance continue to grow all over Jordy's farm, everything Jordy has touched, and even on Jordy's body, which causes him to itch furiously. Jordy panics as he discovers the increasing growth, and tries to calm himself by pouring himself a bottle of vodka and mixing it with orange juice. Soon after, Jordy falls asleep in a drunken stupor.\n\nJordy wakes up sometime later, believing the experience to have been a dream, but his hopes are dashed when he sees that the plant growth has managed to reach inside the house, as well as discovering in a mirror that he has now grown a green beard. He starts to draw a bath to relieve the itching, but he is visited by the ghost of his deceased father, who appears in his mirror and warns him against doing so by telling him that water is what the plants want. Grimly rationalizing that not getting in would only delay the inevitable, Jordy laments that \"[he's] a goner already.\" When the itching from the growth on his skin becomes unbearable, Jordy succumbs to temptation and collapses into the bathwater.\n\nThe next morning, Jordy's farm has been completely coated with dense layers of the [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]] [[vegetation]], with Jordy himself transformed into a human-shaped collection of plant matter. In despair, he reaches for a [[Coach gun|Coach Gun]], prays to God that his luck will be in just this once, and blows the top of his head off, killing himself. Immediately afterwards, a TV weather forecast announces that moderate temperatures and heavy rains are predicted, the implication being that this will accelerate the spread of the extraterrestrial plant growth to surrounding areas, and will continue to the point where the Earth may be [[Terraforming|terraform]]ed into an entirely green planet.\n\n===\"Something to Tide You Over\"===\nRichard Vickers is a vicious and heartless millionaire whose spry jocularity belies his cold-blooded and murderous nature. He visits Harry Wentworth, the man with whom his wife Becky is having an affair. Richard mentions that he and Becky never shared any actual affection, but such is beside the issue; Richard's point of honor is always keeping what's \"his\", a rule that he enforces no matter what. Rather than physically assault Harry, Richard plays a recording of Becky's voice, where she tearfully begs Harry to help her. Both men travel to Comfort Point, Richard's isolated [[beach house]]. Richard points out what appears to be a burial mound in the sand. When Harry promptly runs to it, Richard pulls a gun on him. He forces Harry to jump into the empty hole and begin burying himself.\n\nEventually, Richard finishes burying Harry neck-deep in the sand below the high-tide line. Richard then sets up a [[closed-circuit television|closed-circuit TV camera]] and a [[VCR]] to record Harry. He also brings along a monitor displaying Becky, who is also buried up to her neck further down the beach, where the rising tide is already washing over her face. Richard does tell Harry that he and Becky have a chance of survival: if they can hold their breath long enough for the sand to loosen once the seawater covers them, they can break free and escape. With that, Richard abandons Harry and returns to Comfort Point. Sipping a cocktail, Richard watches with great satisfaction as Harry and Becky slowly drown. Just before Harry is completely submerged by the advancing tide, he looks directly into the camera and vows revenge on Richard.\n\nHours later, Richard returns to Harry's \"grave\" to collect the tape. He finds the ruined monitor, but no sign of Harry. Not disturbed, Richard writes this off as the body having been carried away by the current. Later that night, Richard hears voices calling his name, as a mysterious unseen presence easily bypasses Comfort Point's extensive security system. The culprits turn out to be Harry and Becky, the two lovers having returned as waterlogged, seaweed-covered revenants intent on revenge on their killer. Richard shoots them, but when the bullets have no effect, he barricades himself in his bedroom, only to find Becky and Harry already inside. The two victims taunt Richard, who laughs insanely.\n\nSometime later, the undead lovers have buried Richard up to his neck on the beach. They have since disappeared together into the surf, leaving Richard's own seaweed-covered video camera to record his coming demise. As the approaching tide proceeds to drown him, the hysterical Richard screams that he can hold his breath \"for a LONG time!\"\n\n===\"The Crate\"===\nMike Latimer, a [[janitor]] at Horlicks University, drops a quarter he was flipping which rolls behind a grate under a basement staircase. While attempting to retrieve the coin, he comes across a wooden storage crate marked \"Ship to Horlicks University via Julia Carpenter - [[Arctic]] Expedition - June 19, 1834\" hidden underneath the staircase. He calls Professor Dexter Stanley to notify him of the discovery, drawing Dexter away from a faculty social gathering. Also at the gathering are Dexter's best friend, the mild-mannered Professor Henry Northrup, and Henry's perpetually drunk, obnoxious, and emotionally-abusive wife Wilma \"Billie\", who has a penchant for embarrassing herself, belittling her husband, and annoying or insulting everybody she meets. Henry regularly fantasizes about killing his horrific wife, but is far too timid to actually go through with it.\n\nStanley meets Mike at Amberson Hall, where the former discovers the crate. Both men move the crate into a nearby biology lab, where they tirelessly work to get it open. In the process, Mike sticks his hand inside the crate and begins yelling in pain. The crate opens to reveal its contents: a shaggy, [[ape]]-like creature with sharp fangs. Despite its diminutive size, the creature promptly kills and devours Mike whole, leaving behind only his mangled boot. Fleeing the lab, Dexter bumps into graduate student Charlie Gereson, to whom he frantically relays what happened. While skeptical, Charlie agrees to investigate the professor's claims. The two find the lab covered in blood, with no sign of the creature or its crate. They discover that the crate has been moved back under the stairs, where they also discover Mike's boot. Wanting to measure the bite marks on the boot, Charlie examines the crate closer. The creature pounces on Charlie and kills him, prompting Dexter to escape and take the boot with him.\n\nTraumatized and hysterical, Dexter runs to Henry's house after Wilma leaves for the evening. He tells Henry everything that happened since the crate was discovered, and insists that the monster must be disposed of somehow. Seeing the supposed creature as an ideal way to rid himself of his wife, Henry appears to believe Dexter's story. To this end, Henry spikes Dexter's drink with sleeping pills and writes a note stating that Dexter had supposedly assaulted a female student. This brings Wilma rushing to Amberson Hall, where Henry has since cleaned up the bloody lab. When Wilma arrives, Henry lures her under the basement stairs, trying to awaken the creature. As Wilma rants at Henry for dragging her out there in the middle of the night and assaulting her, the beast awakens and proceeds to eat her.\n\nThe next morning, Henry tells Dexter that he secured the beast inside its crate, and then dumped the crate into a nearby quarry, watching as it sank to the bottom. He convinces Dexter that the creature has drowned, and both men agree to let the authorities handle the disappearances. Unknown to Henry and Dexter, the beast is shown to still be alive, and is last seen tearing the submerged crate apart.\n\n===\"They're Creeping Up on You!\"===\nUpson Pratt is a ruthlessly cruel business mogul who suffers from [[mysophobia]], which has rendered him living in a hermetically-sealed penthouse apartment outfitted with electric locks and surveillance cameras. His apparent contacts with the outside world are through the telephone and are primarily made to put-upon employees. One stormy night, Pratt receives a call from George Gendron, one of his subordinates, about the fact that his company (Pratt International) has recently instigated a [[corporate takeover]] of the Pacific Aerodyne company. Gendron also informs Mr. Pratt that the takeover caused a business rival, Norman Castonmeyer, to commit suicide, much to Pratt's delight.\n\nDuring the call, Pratt slowly begins finding [[cockroaches]] around his apartment. Being a fanatical insect hater, Pratt arms himself with bug spray in an attempt to combat the insects. Before long, someone manages to get through on Pratt's private line. The caller turns out to be Norman Castonmeyer's widow Lenore, who tearfully recalls her husband's final moments and curses Pratt for causing his death. After finding pieces of cockroaches in his food processor, Pratt receives a call from his building's superintendent Carl Reynolds, currently on vacation in [[Orlando, Florida|Orlando]]. Despite his vacation, Pratt forces Reynolds to send the building's handyman Mr. White to call an exterminator under the threat of firing him.\n\nSoon after, Pratt discovers more cockroaches in a box of cereal, trying and failing to crush any that he can. Mr. White soon arrives outside Pratt's door, and tells him (speaking in a stereotypical [[minstrel show|minstrel]] voice to mock him) that he is calling a fumigation service. A [[rolling blackout]] then heads towards the building. During the blackout, cockroaches numbering in the hundreds of thousands begin pouring out of every nook and cranny in Pratt's apartment. As the insects overwhelm Pratt, he activates the emergency power and attempts to call the police for assistance. The police are unfortunately unable to be of any help because of the blackout, nor is Mr. White, who is stuck in the elevator.\n\nAt his wit's end, Pratt locks himself inside a climate-controlled [[panic room]] to escape the growing swarm of cockroaches. He gets to get another call from Lenore, who continues to curse at him. It's during this call that Pratt finds his bedcovers wriggling, and he removes them to discover that the cockroaches have already invaded the panic room. With no way for Pratt to escape, the cockroach swarm charges at him, which induces a fatal heart attack.\n\nWhen electricity returns to the building, the apartment is utterly devoid of cockroaches. Pratt's corpse is shown in the panic room as Mr. White calls in to report. When he gets no answer, Mr. White mockingly asks Pratt \"Bugs got your tongue?\" Pratt's body soon begins to contort as cockroaches burst out of his mouth and chest, re-enveloping the panic room. Mr. White continues to call Pratt's name to get a response, then calls him a bastard when he gets no answer.\n\n===Epilogue===\nThe next morning, two garbage collectors find the ''Creepshow'' comic book on the curb. They look at the ads in the book for [[X-Ray Specs (novelty)|X-ray specs]] and a [[Charles Atlas]] bodybuilding course. They also see the advertisement for the voodoo doll that was briefly glimpsed earlier, but lament that the order form has already been redeemed.\n\nInside the Hopkins house, Stan complains to his wife that he is suffering from a stiff neck, figuring that he must have strained it. Upstairs, Billy is revealed to have sent away for the voodoo doll, and has decorated it with a piece of his father's clothing and some of his hair. Stan clutches his throat in [[pain]] as Billy repeatedly and gleefully jabs the voodoo doll with a pin, finally getting revenge on his father for his abuse.\n\nThe images of Billy jabbing the doll becomes the cover of the next issue of ''Creepshow''. The Creep is seen holding the same comic book, laughing sinisterly as a candle goes out.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Col-begin}}\n{{Col-break}}\n\n'''Prologue and epilogue'''\n* [[Joe Hill (writer)|Joe King]] as Billy Hopkins{{efn|name=Hopkins|Although not outright stated, Billy's last name can be briefly seen on the package that the Voodoo Doll came in at the end, implying the family's last name is Hopkins.}}\n* Iva Jean Saraceni as Billy's mother\n* [[Tom Atkins (actor)|Tom Atkins]] (uncredited) as Stan Hopkins{{efn|name=Hopkins}}\n* Marty Schiff as Garbageman #1\n* [[Tom Savini]] as Garbageman #2\n\n{{Col-break}}\n\n'''Father's Day'''\n* [[Jon Lormer]] as Nathan Grantham\n* [[Viveca Lindfors]] as Bedelia Grantham\n* Elizabeth Regan as Cass Blaine\n* [[Warner Shook]] as Richard Grantham\n* [[Ed Harris]] as Hank Blaine\n* [[Carrie Nye]] as Sylvia Grantham\n* Peter Messer as Yarbro\n* [[John Amplas]] as Nathan's Corpse\n* Nann Mogg as Mrs. Danvers\n\n{{Col-break}}\n\n'''The Lonesome Death of Jordy Verrill'''\n* [[Stephen King]] as Jordy Verrill\n* [[Bingo O'Malley]] as Jordy's father and Doctor\n\n{{Col-break}}\n\n'''Something to Tide You Over'''\n* [[Leslie Nielsen]] as Richard Vickers\n* [[Gaylen Ross]] as Becky Vickers\n* [[Ted Danson]] as Harry Wentworth\n* [[Richard Gere]] (uncredited)<ref>{{cite web|last=Kennedy|first=Michael|title=Every Future Movie Star in Creepshow|date=29 May 2020|publisher=[[Screen Rant]]|url=https://screenrant.com/creepshow-movie-future-stars/|access-date=6 September 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"amazing\">{{cite web|last=Fahnestalk|first=Steve|title=CREEPSHOW RESURRECTED!

Romero to recreate the feel of classic 1950s EC horror comics, such as ''[[Tales from the Crypt (comics)|Tales from the Crypt]]]]\"Father's Day\", \"Something to Tide You Over\" and \"They're Creeping Up on You!\" are original stories by King written for the film. \"The Lonesome Death of Jordy Verrill\" is based on King's short story \"[[Weeds (short story)|Weeds]]\" and \"The Crate\" is based on [[The Crate|the short story of the same name]].\n\nIn keeping with Romero's tradition of filming in and around the Pittsburgh area, most of the film was shot in an empty all-girls school located outside [[Greensburg, Pennsylvania]]. The school was converted into a film studio, and the episodes \"The Lonesome Death of Jordy Verrill\" and \"They're Creeping Up on You\", as well as the prologue and epilogue, were filmed in their entirety at the former school. Filming took place at the Greensburg location throughout 1981.\n\nSeveral additional locations were also used for filming: \n* \"The Crate\"&nbsp;\u2014 most of the interior and exterior shots for the university sequences were filmed at [[Carnegie-Mellon University]]<ref name=\"Tiech\"/> (Romero is a Carnegie-Mellon University alumnus), with Margaret Morrison Hall serving as Amberson Hall.

No other special features have ever been released with the Region 1 version. The Region 1 DVD was a two-sided disc. One side was the 1.85:1 transfer (widescreen) version of the film and the other side was the full-screen version,\n\nA two-disc Special Edition DVD of ''Creepshow'' was released on October 22, 2007, in the [[United Kingdom|UK]]. The discs feature a brand new widescreen transfer of the film sourced from the original master, a making-of documentary running 90 minutes (titled ''Just Desserts: The Making of Creepshow''), behind-the-scenes footage, rare [[deleted scene]]s, galleries, a commentary track with director [[George A. Romero]] and make-up effects artist, [[Tom Savini]], and more. The owner of Red Shirt Pictures, Michael Felsher is responsible for the special edition, the [[Documentary film|documentary]] and [[audio commentary]] in particular.\n\nOn September 8, 2009, the film was released on Blu-ray. Again the only special feature is the film's trailer. [[Scream Factory]] re-released the film on Blu-ray with new special features (along with most of the ones from the UK release) on October 23, 2018. This release is sourced from a brand new 4K scan of the original camera negative, despite the fact there was some criticism with the 5.1 audio track having been pitched too high and having sync issues (the included stereo track however has no issues).<ref>{{Citation|title=Creepshow Blu-ray (Collector's Edition)|url=https://www.blu-ray.com/movies/Creepshow-Blu-ray/209360/|access-date=October 30, 2021}}</ref>\n\nSecond Sight acquired the license to release a new Blu-ray in the United Kingdom. It contains all of the special features included in the special two-disc edition which was released in 2007. It also contains a new audio commentary with Director of Photography Michael Gornick, Actor John Amplas, Property Master Bruce Alan Green and make-up effects assistant Darryl Ferrucci.\n\n==Soundtrack==\n{{Main|Creepshow (soundtrack)}}\n\n==Legacy, sequels, and adaptations==\nThe film was adapted into an actual comic book [[Creepshow (comics)|of the same name]] soon after the film's release. [[Bernie Wrightson]], known for his work on ''[[Heavy Metal (film)|Heavy Metal]]'' and Warren magazines, and fittingly influenced by the 1950s E.C. Comics, did the artwork and is also the uncredited writer of the comic.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tcj.com/the-berni-wrightson-interview/|title = The Berni Wrightson Interview|date = 22 March 2017}}</ref>\n\n''[[Tales from the Darkside]]'' was the television spin-off.  Due to [[Warner Bros]] holding certain rights including the name Creepshow, the title was changed.\n\nA [[sequel]], ''[[Creepshow 2]]'', was released in 1987, and was once again based on Stephen King short stories, with a screenplay from ''Creepshow'' director George A. Romero. The film contained only three tales of horror (due to budget constraints) as opposed to the original's five stories.\n\nAnother sequel, ''[[Creepshow 3]]'', featuring no involvement from Stephen King, George A. Romero, or anyone else involved in the production of the first two films, was released [[direct-to-video]] in 2007 (though it was finished in 2006) to mostly negative reviews. This film, in a fashion similar to the original ''Creepshow'', features five short, darkly comedic [[Horror fiction|horror]] stories.\n\nTaurus Entertainment (rights holders of the original ''Creepshow'') licensed the rights to [[Jace Hall]], of HDFILMS, a Burbank, California company, to produce ''Creepshow: RAW'', a [[web series]] based upon the original film. The [[pilot episode]] for ''Creepshow: RAW'' was wrapped on July 30, 2008. The pilot was directed by [[Wilmer Valderrama]] and features [[Michael Madsen]]. No other episodes have been produced.\n\nAnother ''[[Creepshow (TV series)|Creepshow]]'' television series was announced in July 2018, which was produced by [[Greg Nicotero]] and streamed on [[Shudder (streaming service)|Shudder]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.denofgeek.com/uk/go/59189|title=Creepshow TV series stories confirmed|website=Den of Geek}}{{Dead link|date=July 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Each episode of the series consisted of two stories.
