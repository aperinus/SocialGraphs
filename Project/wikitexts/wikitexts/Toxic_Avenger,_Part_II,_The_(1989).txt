It is the second installment of [[The Toxic Avenger (franchise)|''The Toxic Avenger'']] franchise. It was directed by [[Lloyd Kaufman]] and features The Toxic Avenger in an adventure to Japan to meet his father. [[Devilman]] and [[Cutie Honey]] creator [[Go Nagai]] makes a [[cameo appearance]]. The film is also the debut of actor/martial artist [[Michael Jai White]] and musician/composer/performance artist [[Phoebe Legere]].\n\n==Plot==\nMelvin Junko has been transformed into the superhero known as the Toxic Avenger. He has made Tromaville a safe place again. His blind girlfriend Claire gets him a job at the Tromaville Center for the Blind.\n\nApocalypse Inc., a New York-based chemical company, finds Tromaville to be the perfect home for its new takeover site, and has an employee disguised as a PUS deliveryman deliver a bomb into the center. Claire escapes upon learning of the bomb, but everyone else is killed. When the deliveryman and an Apocalypse construction worker arrive to begin their takeover, the Toxic Avenger emerges from the rubble and kills them. This leads to an all-out assault by members of Apocalypse Inc. Toxie defeats the thugs. Displeased, the Chairman orders his number one Mona Malfaire to call a meeting with the [[board of directors]] and fire the entire personnel department.\n\nApocalypse Inc. discover Toxie's father had left him and his mother when he was a baby. Using one of their \"bad girls\" as Toxie's psychologist, they convince Toxie to go to Japan to look for his father even though he has reservations about leaving Claire. Claire tells Toxie to go find his father. Toxie heads to Japan using a windsurfboard and a paper, asking for his father from the worker at a local Japanese restaurant. However, forgetting his passport, he enters Tokyo [[Godzilla]]-style, shocking a group of beachgoers. He runs into Masami, who is at first shocked, but befriends him after he saves her from some thugs. She offers to help him find his father.\n\nApocalypse Inc. takes advantage of Toxie's absence and begins a hostile takeover of Tromaville. People who stand up against them are beaten or killed.\n\nMasami and Toxie find Big Mac Junko, a Japanese man. Toxie is elated until Masami sees a shipment of fish dropped on the floor and discovers cocaine in the fish. Big Mac is a Yakuza leader who delves in drug dealing. Toxie goes through a series of battles against Yakuza enforcers and Kabuki warriors. Using the environment to his advantage, Toxie defeats the entire gang, only leaving him and his father. Big Mac reveals to Toxie a bottle of \"anti-Tromatons\", which can kill Toxie. Toxie kicks the bottle out of his father's hand and pushes him to a fish butcher, who, excited by the action, kills Toxie's dad by chopping him up. The bottle breaks and Toxie begins to weaken. Masami takes Toxie to a sumo gym, where he is healed and begins training in the art of sumo before saying goodbye to Masami and heading back to Tromaville.\n\nHe learns that Malfaire and the \"bad girls\" are assaulting Claire. He takes on the bad girls while Claire gets the upper hand on Malfaire, incapacitating her. The Chairman hires a motorcycle rider named Dark Rider to destroy Tromaville. With nitroglycerin strapped to Dark Rider's back, the plan is for the Dark Rider to burst into City Hall. Toxie hijacks a taxi and after a series of turns and misses, ends up crashing. Toxie hijacks a hovercraft and drives it after the Dark Rider, forcing him to bust into a home, causing the Dark Rider's demise.\n\nThe people of Tromaville are elated. A man arrives in Tromaville and is revealed to be Melvin's real father. The Yakuza leader he defeated in Japan was \"Bic Mac Bunko\", who is glad to be reunited with both Melvin and his mom and is happy that Bunko, who had used [[identity theft]] against him, is no more. The Chairman and Malfaire unsuccessfully attempt to hitch a ride back to New York.\n\n==Cast==\n* John Altamura as The Toxic Avenger / Melvin Junko, a former janitor that was mutated into a deformed superhero.

However, according to a 2001 interview with Fazio, Altamura abused his authority by complaining about the make-up and had threatened some staff members, pushing Kaufman to fire Altamura.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRTCeZnVdjs \"Toxie Tours Troma: Ron Fazio returns to the Troma building in 12 years.\"]</ref> Kaufman then hired Fazio to play the Toxic Avenger when production moved to Tokyo, Japan. However, Kaufman kept the scenes with Altamura in the film, hence in the film's opening fight sequence, it is seen that both Fazio and Altamura face against each other with Fazio playing the tiger-striped member of Apocalypse Inc who gets punched Exorcist-style by Altamura's Toxic Avenger. Fazio's voice would be used as the Toxic Avenger.\n\nIn addition to Tokyo,<ref>{{cite web |last=Kaufman|first=Lloyd|date=July 17, 2015 |url=https://www.talkhouse.com/lloyd-kaufman-the-toxic-avenger-talks-takashi-murakamis-jellyfish-eyes/|title=Lloyd Kaufman (The Toxic Avenger) Talks Takashi Murakami's Jellyfish Eyes |publisher=Talkhouse|access-date=October 24, 2020}}</ref> filming locations included New York City and New Jersey.<ref>{{cite web |last=Magnotta|first=Ernie|date=May 25, 2015|url=https://www.cinemaretro.com/index.php?/archives/8646-REVIEW-THE-TOXIC-AVENGER-PART-II-1989,-BLU-RAY-SPECIAL-EDITION-FROM-TROMA-ENTERTAINMENT.html|title=Review: The Toxic Avenger: Part II|publisher=Cinemaretro.com|access-date=October 24, 2020}}</ref> [[Michael Jai White]] made his film debut in the film and not only acted as a member of Apocalypse Inc., but assisted with the film's fight sequences in New York while Hitoshi Genma coordinated the film's action scenes in Japan.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://worldfilmgeek.com/2016/09/13/review-the-toxic-avenger-part-ii-1989/|title=The Toxic Avenger Part II (1989)|publisher=Worldfilmgeek.com|access-date=October 24, 2020}}</ref>\n\nLloyd Kaufman was told that the main Japanese actors, Rikiya Yasuoka and Mayako Katsuragi, spoke English. However, upon his shooting the scenes, he learned that Yasuoka and Katsuragi's English was not good enough. During post-production, Lloyd hired his wife Patricia, who also appears in the film as the \"blind mother\" and at the time, was the New York City Film Commissioner, to dub Katsuragi's voice. Co-creator/producer Michael Herz dubbed Yasuoka's voice.\n\n==Home media==\nThe 'Unrated Director's cut' version released on DVD by [[Troma Entertainment]] is missing almost all scenes of gore.
