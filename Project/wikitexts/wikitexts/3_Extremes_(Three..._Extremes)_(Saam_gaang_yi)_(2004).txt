''Dumplings'' was released as [[Dumplings (film)|a theatrical feature film]] the same year, and was cut down to a shorter length for its inclusion in ''Three... Extremes''.\n\n==Films==\n===''[[Dumplings (film)|Dumplings]]''===\nAging actress Mrs. Li wants to rejuvenate her youth and beauty to attract the attention of her husband, Li, who has secretly taken a mistress behind her back. She buys dumplings from Aunt Mei, a mysterious seller who claims to be much older than she appears. However, to her disgust, she learns that the [[dumplings]] are in fact made from aborted [[fetuses]], which Mei takes from a nearby hospital that has a secret abortion facility, as well as working as an abortion midwife herself.\n\nNevertheless, Mrs. Li decides to continue eating the fetus [[dumplings]]. One of them, made from a five-month-old fetus (the 'oldest' of the aborted fetuses thus far), seems to have a positive effect on Mrs. Li's [[libido]], yet it also causes her skin to exhibit a fishy smell. Eventually, Mei has to move out when the authorities are about to capture her. Mrs. Li, now two months pregnant despite being declared infertile earlier, is still desperate for a rejuvenation and chooses to abort her own fetus, presumably to make it into [[dumplings]].\n\n===''Cut''===\nA successful film director has to face a night of misery when a man who appeared in five of his films as an extra, captures both him and his wife to play a deadly game. The wife, a pianist, is gagged and trapped in a system of sharp wires at her piano. The director is instructed to strangle a young girl the extra met while on the way, or else the extra will chop off the wife's fingers one by one every five minutes. The extra reveals that he kidnapped the couple because he is jealous that the director is able to be a rich and good man, while he is poor and abusive to his wife and son, the former of whom he murdered before the incident.\n\nThe director tries to buy time by telling stories of his infidelity, though the extra continues to chop the wife's fingers until only one remains on her left hand. The director ultimately decides to kill the young girl by strangling her. He tries, but does not quite succeed in killing her. The young girl's wig comes off and she is revealed to be a boy \u2014 the extra's son. The extra is only stopped when he slips after stepping on a bloody ring that the wife was wearing before he chopped off her ring finger. The wife then bites the extra's neck, pushing him into the wires that imprison her, leaving him bleeding to death. Traumatized and delusional, the director, now believing his wife to be the extra's son and vice versa, strangles her to death.\n\n===''Box''===\nKyoko, a 25-year-old novelist, frequently experiences nightmares of her past as a circus performer. Back when she was 10 years old, Kyoko worked in a circus with her twin sister Shoko and their benefactor Higata. Kyoko felt that Higata was favoring Shoko over her when he praised her after a performance. When Shoko was training, Kyoko forced and locked her into a box. However, Higata watched the incident and tried to rescue her, only for Kyoko to scar him in the face and then accidentally set the box in flames. Since then, Kyoko is haunted with guilt and wants to apologize to her sister. She is also struck uncannily by her literature publisher, Yoshii, who is a [[doppelg\u00e4nger]] of Higata, except that he is more caring to her.\n\nOne day, Kyoko follows an invitation to her old circus, only to discover the box containing Shoko's burned remains. She is confronted by Higata, who is distraught after the incident and tells her that both Kyoko and Shoko are important to him, but only as one entity. After luring her into kissing him, he forces her into a plastic sack, fits it into a box, then buries it in the nearby snowy ground. However, it is revealed that the entire event of the film is just another dream of Kyoko, who in reality has been [[Conjoined twins|conjoined]] with Shoko since birth. The sisters exit the house to meet with Higata/Yoshii, both indeed the same person.\n\n==Cast==\n\n===''Dumplings''===\n* [[Miriam Yeung]] as Mrs Li\n* [[Bai Ling]] as Mei\n* Pauline Lau as Li's maid \n* [[Tony Leung Ka-fai]] as Li\n* Meme Tian as Connie\n\n===''Cut''===\n* [[Lee Byung-hun]] as Director\n* [[Im Won-hee]] as Stranger\n* [[Kang Hye-jung]] as Director's wife\n* [[Yum Jung-ah]] as actress in vampire role\n\n===''Box''===\n* [[Ky\u014dko Hasegawa]] as Kyoko\n* [[Atsuro Watabe]] as Yoshii/Higata\n* Mai Suzuki as Young Kyoko\n* Yuu Suzuki as Young Shoko\n\n==''Dumplings'' theatrical==\n{{Main|Dumplings (film)}}\n''Three...
