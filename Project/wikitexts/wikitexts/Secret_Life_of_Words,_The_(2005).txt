It was released on 15 December 2006.\n\n==Plot==\nTaciturn, partially [[deaf]] Hanna (Polley) is a [[Yugoslavia]]n native working in a factory in [[Northern Ireland]]. She is forced to use annual leave by her boss, who tells her that her co-workers have been offended by her work diligence. After overhearing a conversation about a need for a nurse, she takes on a job as private nurse for burn victim Josef (Robbins). He is bedridden on an offshore [[Oil platform|oil rig]] after a fire on the rig, and has severe burns and is temporarily [[blindness|blinded]]. The rig is not operational awaiting an investigation, and few people remain on board.\n\nHanna talks very little, and especially does not want to talk about herself. Despite his pain, Josef is constantly making jokes, some of them humorous sexual advances. Hanna's care for him includes holding the urinal and washing his entire body. As they get closer, they start sharing their experiences. Unbeknownst to him, she listens over and over again to a message on his mobile phone from a mysterious woman who was in love with him.\n\nHanna learns from a colleague that Josef was injured while trying to save a man who committed [[suicide]] by jumping into the oil-rig fire. Some other tragic connection between the two men is implied. He tells about a near-drowning experience because he cannot swim. Eventually Josef confides to Hanna his greatest secret guilt, and she tells him about her previous life in the former [[Yugoslavia]]. She describes in detail the horrors she endured during the Balkan Wars ([[Yugoslav Wars]]), including being [[kidnapping|kidnapped]] and repeatedly [[rape]]d. She shares experiences of the other women, including one that was forced to shoot her own daughter, and the slow and agonizing death of her best friend. She tells of her own repeated [[torture]] and lets him feel the scars on her body from the wounds inflicted on her.\n\nJosef is not getting better, and at Hanna's initiative he is air-lifted off the oil rig to be taken to a hospital. When the helicopter lands, Josef wants Hanna to accompany him, but she walks away without a word. However, she leaves behind a backpack (apparently intentionally), and it contains enough information to give Josef a chance to find her. After he recovers, Josef travels to [[Denmark]] to visit a counselor that Hanna had seen after fleeing the war, seeking to learn more about her. He then tracks her down at the factory in Northern Ireland where she works. They talk, and at first she keeps her distance, saying she couldn't be with him because she thinks one day she could drown them both in her sorrow. When he tells her that he will \"learn to swim,\" she reciprocates the love. Later, Hanna is shown in a home with the voice of a young girl explaining that Hanna now has two sons, whom the narrator refers to as her brothers, indicating that the woman Hanna described as having been forced to kill her own child was, in fact, herself. The voice of her daughter ends the film with the hope that Hanna will one day be able to live completely in the \"now\" and no longer be haunted by the past.\n\n==Cast==\n{| class=wikitable\n|-\n!Actor\n!Role\n|-\n|[[Sarah Polley]]||Hanna\n|-\n|[[Tim Robbins]]||Josef\n|-\n|[[Javier C\u00e1mara]]||Simon\n|-\n| [[Sverre Anker Ousdal]]||Dimitri\n|-\n|[[Steven Mackintosh]]||Doctor Sulitzer\n|-\n|[[Eddie Marsan]]||Victor\n|-\n|[[Julie Christie]]||Inge\n|-\n|[[Daniel Mays]]||Martin\n|-\n|[[Dean Lennox Kelly]]||Liam\n|-\n|Danny Cunningham||Scott\n|-\n|Emmanuel Idowu||Abdul\n|-\n|Reg Wilson||Manager\n|}\n\n==Reception==\n===Critical response===\nOn review aggregator [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film holds an approval rating of 69% based on 39 reviews, with an average rating of 6.20/10.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Secret Life of Words|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/secret_life_of_words|website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|publisher=[[Flixster]]|accessdate=1 July 2021}}</ref> On [[Metacritic]], the film has a [[weighted arithmetic mean|weighted average]] score of 68 out of 100, based on 11 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".<ref>{{cite web|title=The Secret Life of Words|url=https://www.metacritic.com/movie/grand-isle|website=[[Metacritic]]|publisher=[[CBS Interactive]]|accessdate=1 July 2021}}</ref>\n\nV.A.
