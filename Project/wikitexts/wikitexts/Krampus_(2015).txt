The film stars [[Adam Scott (actor)|Adam Scott]], [[Toni Collette]], [[David Koechner]], [[Allison Tolman]], [[Conchata Ferrell]], [[Emjay Anthony]], [[Stefania LaVie Owen]], with Krista Stadler, and introducing Lolo Owen, Queenie Samuel, Maverick Flack, and Sage Hunefeld. In the film, a dysfunctional family squabbling causes a young boy to lose his festive spirit. Doing so unleashes the wrath of [[Krampus]], a fearsome, horned demonic beast in ancient European folklore who punishes naughty children at Christmas time. As Krampus lays siege to the neighborhood, the family must band together to save one another from a monstrous fate.\n\nThe concept for ''Krampus'' began in 2011, when Dougherty was planning to make a [[Christmas]]-themed horror film, with him and Shields writing the screenplay. Production on the film began in 2014, with Dougherty directing and writing a new screenplay with Shields and Casey. The casting call began from November 2014 to March 2015. [[Principal photography]] on the film began on March 12 and wrapped in May 2015. Creature effects were made by [[Weta Workshop]].\n\n''Krampus'' was released in the United States on December 4, 2015 by [[Universal Pictures]]. It received mixed reviews and grossed over $61 million against a $15 million budget.<ref name=DreadCentral>{{cite web | url = https://dreadcentral.com/news/76670/legendarys-krampus-coming-december-2015/ | title = Legendary's Krampus Coming December 2015 | last1 = Barton | first1 = Steve | date = October 30, 2014 | website = [[Dread Central]] | publisher = Dread Central Media |access-date=July 11, 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"Hollywood Reporter\">{{cite news | last = Ford | first = Rebecca | date = October 30, 2014 | title = Legendary and Universal's 'Krampus' Avoids Showdown with Seth Rogen Christmas Movie | url = https://hollywoodreporter.com/news/legendary-universals-krampus-avoids-showdown-745139 | newspaper = [[The Hollywood Reporter]] |publisher=[[Prometheus Global Media]] |access-date=July 11, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nThree days before [[Christmas]], the prosperous but dysfunctional Engel family prepare for the holidays. The youngest member of the family, Max Engel remains a firm believer in [[Santa Claus]] and intends to send him a letter. His family includes his teenage sister Beth, their parents Tom and Sarah, and Tom's mother, whom the family calls Omi, and who speaks mostly [[German language|German]]. Sarah's side of the family visiting for Christmas include Aunt Linda and Uncle Howard, Sarah and Linda's cantankerous Aunt Dorothy, and Linda and Howard's children Howie Jr., Stevie, Jordan, and baby Chrissie as well as their [[bulldog]] Rosie.\n\nMax wants to continue family traditions, but tensions among his relatives sap their Christmas spirit. When his cousins read out his letter to Santa and mock him for still believing, he fights with them and yells out that he hates his family and even Christmas. His father comforts him by telling him that even though there is chaos during the holidays, he should always love his family and he gives him his letter to Santa. But in a fit of anger, Max tears up the letter and throws it to the wind outside whereupon it is swept up into the sky.\n\nLater that night, a severe [[blizzard]] engulfs the town, causing a power outage. When Beth ventures out to check on her boyfriend, a large, horned creature chases her. She hides beneath a delivery truck, but the creature leaves a [[jack-in-the-box]] which attacks her, and gives the impression she is killed.\n\nWhen she does not return home within the hour deadline her mom set, Tom and Howard leave to search for Beth. They find her boyfriend's house in ruins with the chimney split open and large goat-like hoof prints in the house. Outside, the two are attacked by an unseen snow monster hidden in snow. Tom saves Howard from the monster by shooting it with Howard's gun. They return home and board up the windows and everybody tries to get some sleep, except Howard who volunteers to stand guard.\n\nLater, after Howard falls asleep, a large hook with a living gingerbread man attached lures Howie Jr. to the chimney. He takes a bite of the gingerbread man, but it comes to life and he is dragged up the chimney despite the family's efforts to save him. Meanwhile, a fire log is inadvertently kicked aside during their struggle to save Howie, setting the tree and presents ablaze.\n\nOmi explains that the creature hunting them is [[Krampus]], an ancient demonic spirit who punishes those who have lost the Christmas spirit. Omi recounts that when she was a child, her parents and community lost their spirit due to the hardships of the war in Europe. She also lost hope and wished for her parents to be taken away. This wish summoned Krampus. He and his helpers dragged everyone except her to [[Hell]], leaving behind a bell [[Christmas ornament|bauble]] with his name on it. The family remains skeptical until monstrous toys, hidden in presents delivered earlier, invade the house. Upstairs Stevie and Jordan are lured to the attic by Beth's voice; downstairs the adults hear them screaming. Tom, Sarah, and Linda go up to investigate, only to find Jordan being eaten by Der Klown, the jack-in-the-box from before. The family fends off the toys and the gingerbread men, but Krampus' elves leap in through a window, taking Dorothy and Chrissie. Howard, desperate to get his kids back, jumps on Der Klown's back and then disappears after.\n\nTom decides that the family should flee to an abandoned [[snowplow]] on the streets outside. Omi stays behind to distract Krampus, who emerges from the fireplace and attacks her with his bag of toys. Outside, Tom, Sarah, and Linda are dragged under the snow and eaten by the snow monster while Stevie is captured by the elves. Krampus confronts Max and gives him a bell bauble wrapped in a piece of his discarded letter. Realizing that tearing up the letter was what summoned Krampus there in the first place, Max chases after the demon, catching up as the pits of hell open. He begs for Stevie to be spared and offers himself up as a sacrifice. Krampus refuses and tosses Stevie into Hell. Max honestly apologizes for losing his spirit, and although Krampus seems to accept his apology, he still tosses Max into the pit.\n\nMax awakens in his house on Christmas morning. Discovering his family alive and well downstairs, he thinks that what happened was just a nightmare. As he unwraps a present to reveal Krampus' bauble the family are shown with ominous looks on their faces as their memories of the horrific events slowly come back to them.\n\nThe camera pans out, revealing that the house is shown through a magical snow globe, along with hundreds of others in a vast collection in the underworld, for Krampus to monitor and spy on for having spared them.{{efn|The prequel graphic novel ''Krampus: Shadow of Saint Nicholas'' revealed that anyone spared by Krampus will be kept on surveillance by him through their respective snow globes in his workshop.}}\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Emjay Anthony]]<ref name=\"hollywoodreporter1\">{{cite web|url=https://hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/adam-scott-toni-collette-join-778763 |title=Adam Scott, Toni Collette Join Christmas Horror Movie 'Krampus' (Exclusive) |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |publisher=[[Prometheus Global Media]] |date=March 3, 2015 |access-date=March 16, 2015 |first=Borys |last=Kit}}</ref> as Max Engel, a boy who loses the Christmas spirit due to his dysfunctional family's squabbling.\n* [[Adam Scott (actor)|Adam Scott]]<ref name=\"hollywoodreporter1\"/> as Tom Engel, the father of Max.\n* [[Toni Collette]] as Sarah Engel, the mother of Max.\n* [[David Koechner]]<ref name=\"hollywoodreporter1\"/> as Howard, the uncle of Max.\n* [[Allison Tolman]]<ref name=\"avclub1\">{{cite web|first=B.G. |last=Henne |url=https://avclub.com/article/allison-tolman-joins-yuletide-horror-comedy-krampu-212179 |title=Allison Tolman joins Yuletide horror-comedy Krampus |work=[[The A.V.
