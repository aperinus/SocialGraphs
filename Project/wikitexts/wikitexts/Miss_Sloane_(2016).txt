The film stars [[Jessica Chastain]], [[Mark Strong]], [[Gugu Mbatha-Raw]], [[Michael Stuhlbarg]], [[Alison Pill]], [[Jake Lacy]], [[John Lithgow]], and [[Sam Waterston]]. The film follows Elizabeth Sloane, a fierce [[lobbyist]], who fights in an attempt to pass gun control legislation. \n\nThe film had its world premiere on November 11, 2016, at the [[AFI Fest]], and began a limited theatrical release in the United States on November 25, 2016, by [[EuropaCorp]], before expanding wide on December 9, 2016. It was released in France on March 8, 2017. It received generally positive reviews, with Chastain's performance being particularly praised. It was a box office disappointment, grossing only $9 million against its $13\u201318 million budget.\n\n==Plot==\nElizabeth Sloane is a workaholic cutthroat lobbyist who has been called before a [[United States congressional hearing|congressional hearing]] led by Senator Ronald Sperling to answer questions about possible violations of Senate ethics rules during her tenure at [[Washington D.C.]] lobbying firm Cole Kravitz & Waterman.\n\nThree months and one week earlier, Sloane's firm is approached by gun manufacturing representative Bill Sanford to lead the opposition to the proposed Heaton-Harris bill that would [[Universal background check|expand background checks on gun purchases]], specifically by targeting female voters. Sloane ridicules Sanford's idea and is later approached by Rodolfo Schmidt, the head of rival lobbying firm Peterson Wyatt, to instead lead the effort in support of the bill. Sloane agrees and takes most of her staff along with her, though her closest associate Jane Molloy refuses to leave.\n\nAt Peterson Wyatt, Sloane selects Esme Manucharian to conduct the majority of the firm's media appearances, and they begin to make significant progress in garnering votes for the bill. Sloane confronts Esme with knowledge of her background as having survived a school shooting. Even though Esme does not want to disclose the information, Sloane reveals Esme's secret during a live television debate. Later, Esme is held up at gunpoint while leaving her office, but her attacker is shot dead by another civilian who is legally carrying a gun. Gun rights supporters capitalize on this event, which causes the Heaton-Harris bill to lose support in the Senate. This is compounded by the news of the Senate inquiry into Sloane's lobbying practices.\n\nReturning to the congressional hearing, Senator Sperling produces a form requesting approval of overseas travel for a Senator. It was filed by a non-profit organization but completed in Sloane's handwriting, indicating she violated Senate ethics rules with her involvement, as a lobbyist, in arranging the travel. In answer to other questions, Sloane swears under oath that she has never practiced illegal wiretapping.\n\nIn her final statement at the hearing, Sloane admits she anticipated the opposition might attack her personally if Peterson Wyatt made too much progress with the Heaton-Harris bill. She reveals that she had someone (Molloy, her former assistant) secretly working for her, and that she did use a wiretap &ndash; which recorded Senator Sperling accepting bribes from her former boss George Dupont.\n\nTen months later, Sloane is visited by her lawyer in prison. The bill passed, Dupont and Sterling are under investigation and he has petitioned for her early release. He asks if it was worth career suicide, she answers: better than suicide by career. \n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Jessica Chastain]] as Madeline \"Elizabeth\" Sloane\n* [[Mark Strong]] as Rodolfo Schmidt\n* [[Gugu Mbatha-Raw]] as Esme Manucharian\n* [[Alison Pill]] as Jane Molloy\n* [[Michael Stuhlbarg]] as Pat Connors\n* [[Sam Waterston]] as George Dupont\n* [[John Lithgow]] as U.S. Senator Ron M.
