Contract director [[Seijun Suzuki]] had previously worked mainly on pop song films, a youth subgenre in which the films were built around an already popular song, and [[yakuza film]]s with an occasional [[film noir]] bent.<ref name = CC/> It also marked the beginning of his practice of co-writing his films.<ref name = ACC/> Leading man [[Michitaro Mizushima]] had also starred in Suzuki's ''[[Underworld Beauty]]'' two years earlier. He was atypical of borderless action films by virtue of his age, forty-eight at the time, as they typically featured Nikkatsu's younger stars such as [[Yujiro Ishihara]] and [[Akira Kobayashi]].<ref name = CC/>\n\n==Release==\n''Take Aim at the Police Van'' was released in Japan by the [[Nikkatsu]] Company on January 27, 1960.<ref name = kinejun/> It was subsequently released in a five-film DVD box set, titled ''Nikkatsu Noir'', in North America on August 25, 2009, under [[The Criterion Collection]]'s [[Eclipse (DVD)|Eclipse]] label. The set focuses on noir-themed Nikkatsu Action films and also includes ''[[I Am Waiting (film)|I Am Waiting]]'' (1957), ''[[Rusty Knife]]'' (1958), ''[[Cruel Gun Story]]'' (1964) and ''[[A Colt Is My Passport]]'' (1967) with liner notes by film historian Chuck Stephens.<ref name = savant/>\n\n[[The A.V. Club]]'s Noel Murray felt the film holds up against contemporary Hollywood [[film noir]]s. Rating it less abstract than [[Seijun Suzuki]]'s films of a few years later, he highlighted its vim and social candor and named it \"[a testament] to how artists pumping out quickie exploitation product can often work in truths about their times that prestige filmmakers can't.\"<ref name = AV/>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|refs=\n<ref name = CC>{{cite web\n| last = Stephens\n| first = Chuck\n| title = Eclipse Series 17: Nikkatsu Noir\n| publisher = [[The Criterion Collection]]\n| url = http://www.criterion.com/current/posts/1216\n|date=August 2009\n| accessdate = 2009-09-24\n}}</ref>\n<ref name = ACC>{{cite journal\n| last = Weisser\n| first = Thomas\n| year = 1998\n| title = The Films of Seijun Suzuki\n| journal = Asian Cult Cinema\n| volume = 21\n| page = 47\n| publisher = Vital Books\n}}</ref>\n<ref name=kinejun>{{cite web\n |script-title = ja:\uff11\uff13\u53f7\u5f85\u907f\u7dda\u3088\u308a \u305d\u306e\u8b77\u9001\u8eca\u3092\u72d9\u3048\n |publisher    = [[Kinema Junpo]] Movie Database\n |url          = http://www.kinejun.jp/cinema/id/22897\n |language     = Japanese\n |accessdate   = 2009-09-10\n |url-status      = dead\n |archiveurl   = https://web.archive.org/web/20111007222307/http://www.kinejun.jp/cinema/id/22897\n |archivedate  = 2011-10-07\n}}</ref>\n<ref name = savant>{{cite web\n| last = Erickson\n| first = Glenn\n| authorlink = Glenn Erickson\n| title = Eclipse Series 17: Nikkatsu Noir\n| publisher = [[DVD Talk]]\n| url = http://www.dvdsavant.com/s2988nikk.html\n|date=August 2009\n| accessdate = 2009-09-10\n}}</ref>\n<ref name = AV>{{cite news\n| last = Murray\n| first = Noel\n| title = Eclipse Series 17: Nikkatsu Noir\n| newspaper = [[The A.V.
