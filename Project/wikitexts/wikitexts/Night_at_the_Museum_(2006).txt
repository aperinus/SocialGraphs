It is based on the 1993 children's book [[The Night at the Museum|of the same name]] by [[Croatia]]n illustrator [[Milan Trenc]]. The film had an [[ensemble cast]] of [[Ben Stiller]] in the lead role, [[Carla Gugino]], [[Dick Van Dyke]], [[Mickey Rooney]], [[Bill Cobbs]], and [[Robin Williams]]. It tells the story of a divorced father who applies for a job as a [[security guard|night watchman]] at New York City's [[American Museum of Natural History]] and subsequently discovers that the exhibits, animated by a magical [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] artifact, come to life at night. [[20th Century Fox]] released the film on December 22, 2006, and it grossed $574.5 million worldwide, becoming the [[2006 in film#Highest-grossing films|5th highest-grossing film of 2006]], but received mixed reviews from critics.\n\nTwo sequels were released: ''[[Night at the Museum: Battle of the Smithsonian]]'' in 2009, and ''[[Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb]]'' in 2014. An animated sequel, ''[[Night at the Museum: Kahmunrah Rises Again]]'', is also scheduled to be released on December 9th of 2022 for the streaming service [[Disney+]].\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Plot==\nIn [[Brooklyn]], Larry Daley's unstable work history makes his former wife, Erica, consider him a bad example to their ten-year-old son, Nick. Larry worries that Nick admires Erica's fianc\u00e9 Don more than him. To improve his financial stability, Larry applies for a job as night security guard at the [[American Museum of Natural History|Museum of Natural History]]. Retiring guard Cecil Fredericks hires Larry, despite his unpromising r\u00e9sum\u00e9. The museum, facing declining attendance and revenue, is replacing Cecil and his two colleagues, Gus and Reginald, with only one guard. Cecil gives Larry an instruction manual on museum security and warns him not to let anything \"in... or out\".\n\nOn his first night, Larry discovers that after sunset, the exhibits come to life, including a playful ''[[Tyrannosaurus]]'' skeleton nicknamed \"Rexy\"; a mischievous [[Taxidermy|stuffed]] [[capuchin monkey]] named Dexter; various African animals; rival [[miniature figure (gaming)|miniature]] civilizations portraying the [[Old West]], [[Ancient Rome]], and [[Maya civilization|Ancient Maya]]; an [[Easter Island]] [[Moai]] obsessed with chewing gum; wax models of various historical figures, including the violent [[Attila|Attila the Hun]]; an army of [[American Civil War]] soldiers, and four pyromaniacal [[Neanderthal]]s. There is also [[Sacagawea]], who, unlike the other exhibits, is encased in glass. A mounted [[Theodore Roosevelt|Teddy Roosevelt]] rescues Larry from miniature leaders Jedediah and Octavius, who are attacking him. Teddy explains that ever since an ancient Egyptian artifact \u2013 the Golden Tablet of Pharaoh Ahkmenrah \u2013 was brought to the museum in 1952, the exhibits have come to life each night. If any exhibit figure is outside the museum at sunrise, they turn to dust. As Teddy helps Larry restore order, Larry learns that Teddy loves Sacagawea but is too shy to speak to her through the glass.\n\nThe next morning, Cecil, Reginald, and Gus return to check on Larry, but Larry says he is quitting. When Nick and Don stop by the museum to congratulate Larry on his new job, Larry decides to stay for his son's sake. To help him with the job, Cecil advises reading up on history.\n\nThat night, Larry better controls the exhibits, but the four Neanderthals set their display on fire while Dexter steals Larry's keys. As Larry extinguishes the fire, Dexter unlocks a window. One of the Neanderthals sees a trash bin fire on the street below and leaps out the window. Larry, frustrated with everything going awry, once again decides to quit. As he walks out, the [[Christopher Columbus]] statue gestures to where the Neanderthal escaped. Larry runs outside just as the rising sun disintegrates the Neanderthal into dust. Later that morning, museum director Dr. McPhee fires Larry over the damaged Neanderthal exhibit, though Larry convinces him to reconsider. Larry meets Rebecca Hutman, an attractive museum guide and historian. When he offers to introduce her to Sacagawea to help with her doctoral research, Rebecca believes Larry is mocking her.\n\nOne night, Larry brings Nick to the museum to show him the exhibits, but nothing comes to life. They discover Cecil, Gus, and Reginald stealing the tablet and other valuable artifacts. They have disabled the tablet to prevent the exhibits from interfering. Like the exhibits, the guards receive enhanced vitality from the tablet and intend to frame Larry for the thefts. Larry has Nick reactivate the tablet, then tells him to run and hide. After a chase, Cecil locks up Nick and Larry in the Egyptian room and steals back the tablet. Larry releases Ahkmenrah's mummy from his [[sarcophagus]]. The pharaoh then helps Larry and Nick escape. When the three find the other exhibits fighting each other, Larry convinces them to unite to catch the guards and recover the tablet.\n\nThe Civil War soldiers, Neanderthals, and Christopher Columbus capture Gus and Reginald. Cecil escapes in a [[stagecoach]] and is about to run over Sacagawea. Teddy pushes her aside but he is run over and sliced in half. Larry, Nick, Ahkmenrah, Jed, [[Julius Caesar|Octavius]], Rexy, and Attila pursue Cecil to [[Central Park]], where they stop him and regain the tablet. Sacagawea repairs Teddy with warm wax. Rebecca arrives and sees the exhibits returning to the museum before sunrise and realizes the truth. The next day, McPhee fires Larry after news reports about strange events happening around the museum \u2013 such as [[cave painting]]s in the museum's [[81st Street \u2013 Museum of Natural History (IND Eighth Avenue Line)|subway station]], dinosaur [[trace fossil|tracks]] in [[Central Park]], and cavemen sightings. However, when the publicity significantly increases the museum's attendance, McPhee rehires Larry. That night, Larry, Nick, and the exhibits celebrate.\n\nDuring the end credits, Cecil, Gus and Reginald are seen working as the museum janitors as punishment for their crimes.\n\n==Cast==\n===Humans===\n* [[Ben Stiller]] as Larry Daley, a night-shift security guard at the [[American Museum of Natural History]] in New York, Nick's father, and Erica's former husband.\n* [[Carla Gugino]] as Rebecca Hutman, a [[museum docent]].\n* [[Dick Van Dyke]] as Cecil Fredericks, a veteran security guard.\n* [[Mickey Rooney]] as Gus, a veteran security guard, who takes an instant dislike to Larry.\n* [[Bill Cobbs]] as Reginald, a veteran security guard.\n* [[Jake Cherry]] as Nicholas \"Nick\" Daley, Larry's and Erica's son.\n* [[Ricky Gervais]] as Dr. McPhee, the curator of the Museum of Natural History and Larry's boss.\n* [[Kim Raver]] as Erica Daley, Larry's former wife and Nick's mother.\n* [[Charlie Murphy (actor)|Charlie Murphy]] as the taxi-driver.\n* [[Paul Rudd]] as Don, Erica's fianc\u00e9.\n* [[Anne Meara]] as Debbie.\n\n===Exhibits===\n* [[Robin Williams]] as a [[wax sculpture|wax model]] of [[Theodore Roosevelt]], an exhibit who befriends Larry.\n* [[Patrick Gallagher (actor)|Patrick Gallagher]] as a wax model of [[Attila the Hun]], an exhibit who antagonizes Larry at first.\n* [[Rami Malek]] as the [[Mummy (undead)|mummy]] of Ahkmenrah, a [[pharaoh]] who is the owner of the tablet.\n* [[Pierfrancesco Favino]] as a [[bronze statue]] of [[Christopher Columbus]], an Italian-speaking exhibit whose name Larry consistently forgets.\n* [[Steve Coogan]] as Octavius, a miniature Roman general figure.\n* [[Mizuo Peck]] as a polyurethane wax model of [[Sacagawea]].
