The film was released posthumously, as Bob the cat died in June 2020.\n\n== Plot ==\nJames Bowen is a homeless man and former [[heroin]] addict, living on the streets of London and down to his last bits of change. After a life-threatening drug-related incident, his support worker Val gets him into a council flat and prescribes him [[methadone]] in an attempt to get him off the street. On his first night in his flat James discovers a cat rifling through his food. Assuming the cat had escaped from somewhere, James tries to return the cat to his real owners.\n\nAfter letting him go, that same evening the cat returns to James's flat, this time with a purulent wound on his back leg. Worried, James consults his animal-loving but allergic neighbour, Betty. She informs James of a local charity vet where she volunteers, and names the cat Bob. Waiting on a queue at the vet, James misses a meeting with Val.\n\nAfter the appointment, James has Bob neutered and sets him free. However, Bob keeps following James into town, eventually drawing more crowds of people, making James more wealthy, and he eventually decides to keep Bob. Bob becomes a tourist hotspot and James and Betty start to become romantically attached.\n\nOne night while returning home, James finds his old friend, Baz, unconscious on his flat estate, overdosed on heroin. Baz later dies in hospital, and James finds out that Betty cannot be around drug addicts, as her deceased brother had been one. On New Year's Eve, James makes an impromptu visit to his biological father, Jack, his stepmother, Hilary, and his lost sisters, Pris and Faith. After Bob destroys their living room, Hilary sends James and Bob out.\n\nOne day, while [[Street performance|busking]], James gets into an argument with a thug causing the crowd to get in a brawl with the man and James getting arrested for it. Although found innocent, he is prohibited from busking for six months. At the pharmacy where he is waiting to receive his methadone, Betty notices James; they argue and go their separate ways. Later, James visits the offices of ''[[The Big Issue]]'' to make some more money for him and Bob. He regains his popularity with tourists by selling ''The Big Issue''.\n\nAfter being accused of illegally selling magazines on another vendor's patch, James and Bob are banned for a whole month. After going back in business James gets into an argument with a rude woman trying to buy Bob off him, losing Bob in the scuffle. Bob does not return for a few days, leaving James devastated. After Bob returns, James feels he is ready to come off the methadone.\n\nAfter a week of gruelling withdrawal symptoms, James awakes clean and healthy. He goes to visit Betty, who is in the middle of moving and living a life meant for her to live. James and Betty end on a good note. A journalist, Mary, requests to write a book about James and Bob after his Internet and media popularity, and James agrees.\n\nJames then fixes up his relationship with his father Jack, and his life turns around for the better. Later, at a book signing, James is celebrated by Val, his father, and a visiting Betty. James and Betty remain supportive friends as James and Bob continue on their journey together.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Luke Treadaway]] as [[James Bowen (author)|James Bowen]]<ref name=\"Aug2015V\" /><ref name=\"Oct2015SC\" />\n**The real James Bowen makes a [[cameo appearance]], asking an autograph from his character\n* Bob as himself\n** Stand-ins for Bob: Oscar, Booker, Jafffa, Leo, Ricki and Trayce\n* [[Ruta Gedmintas]] as Elizabeth \"Betty\" Robinson, James's animal-loving neighbour and love interest<ref name=\"Aug2015V\" /><ref name=\"Oct2015SC\" />\n* [[Joanne Froggatt]] as Val, James's drug support worker<ref name=\"Oct2015SC\" />\n* [[Anthony Head]] as Jack Bowen, James's remarried father<ref name=\"Oct2015SC\" />\n* [[Beth Goddard]] as Hilary Bowen, Jack's wife and James's stepmother\n* [[Caroline Goodall]] as Mary, an American journalist who [[James Bowen (author)#A Street Cat Named Bob|persuades him to write a book about Bob]]\n* Darren Evans as Baz, James's old friend who did not recover from heroin addiction\n* [[Ruth Sheen]] as Elsie, a kind middle-aged woman, who gives presents to Bob\n* [[Nina Wadia]] as Bus Conductress\n\n== Production and release ==\nOn 24 August 2015, it was announced that [[Roger Spottiswoode]] would direct a film based on the book ''A Street Cat Named Bob'' by [[James Bowen (author)|James Bowen]], while Tim John scripted the film.<ref name=Aug2015V>{{cite news |last=McNary |first=Dave |title=Luke Treadaway to Star in 'A Street Cat Named Bob' Movie|url=https://variety.com/2015/film/news/luke-treadaway-a-street-cat-named-bob-movie-1201576921/|access-date=29 December 2015|work=Variety|date=24 August 2015|language=en-US}}</ref> Adam Rolston would produce the film through his Shooting Script Films.<ref name=\"Aug2015V\" /> The Exchange sold the film's international rights.<ref>{{cite news|last=McNary|first=Dave|title=AFM: 'A Street Cat Named Bob' Sells to Key Markets|url=https://variety.com/2015/film/news/afm-a-street-cat-named-bob-sells-1201632567/|access-date=29 December 2015|work=Variety|date=4 November 2015|language=en-US}}</ref> Maria Nation also wrote the script.<ref name=\"Dec2015SC\" />\n\n[[Principal photography]] on the film began on 25 October 2015 in London, at [[Twickenham Film Studios]] and on location in [[Covent Garden]].<ref name=Oct2015SC>{{cite news|last=Grater|first=Tom|title='A Street Cat Named Bob' to shoot in London from Oct 25; new cast join|url=http://www.screendaily.com/news/street-cat-named-bob-to-shoot-in-london-from-oct-25-new-cast-join/5095587.article|access-date=29 December 2015|work=www.screendaily.com|date=16 October 2015}}</ref> Filming wrapped on 6 December 2015.<ref name=Dec2015SC>{{cite news|last=Rosser|first=Michael|title='A Street Cat Named Bob' wraps London shoot|url=http://www.screendaily.com/news/a-street-cat-named-bob-wraps-shoot/5097947.article|access-date=29 December 2015|work=www.screendaily.com|date=11 December 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=On the Set 12/11/15: James Franco and Seth Rogen Start \u2018The Disaster Artist\u2019, Owen Wilson & Ed Helms Wrap \u2018Bastards\u2019|url=http://www.ssninsider.com/on-the-set-121115-james-franco-and-seth-rogen-start-the-disaster-artist-owen-wilson-ed-helms-wrap-bastards/|access-date=29 December 2015|work=SSN Insider|date=11 December 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151213213620/http://www.ssninsider.com/on-the-set-121115-james-franco-and-seth-rogen-start-the-disaster-artist-owen-wilson-ed-helms-wrap-bastards/|archive-date=13 December 2015|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe world premiere of ''A Street Cat Named Bob'' took place at the [[Curzon Mayfair Cinema]], London on 3 November 2016 and was attended by [[Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge|the Duchess of Cambridge]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Jobson|first=Rob|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/showbiz/celebrity-news/a-street-cat-named-bob-premiere-duchess-of-cambridge-wows-in-white-on-the-red-carpet-a3386766.html|title=A Street Cat Named Bob premiere: Kate Middleton stuns in white on the red carpet|work=London Evening Standarddate=3 November 2016|access-date=3 March 2017}}</ref> The film opened to the public in the UK on 4 November and in the US on 18 November.\n\n== Reception ==\n\n===Box office ===\n''A Street Cat Named Bob'' grossed $82,703 in the United States and Canada and $17,852,881 in other countries for a worldwide total of nearly $18 million, against a production budget of $8 million.<ref name=\"TN\" />\n\n===Critical response===\nOn [[review aggregator]] [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film has an approval rating of 77% based on 65 reviews, with an average score of 5.9/10.
