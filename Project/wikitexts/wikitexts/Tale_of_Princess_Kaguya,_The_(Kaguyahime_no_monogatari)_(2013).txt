Believing her to be a divine presence, he and his wife decide to raise her as their own, calling her \"Princess\". The girl grows rapidly, earning her the nickname {{nihongo|\"Takenoko\"|\u30bf\u30b1\u30ce\u30b3||\"little bamboo\"}} from the village children. {{nihongo|Sutemaru|\u6368\u4e38}}, the oldest among Takenoko's friends, develops a close relationship with her.\n\nMiyatsuko comes upon gold and fine cloth in the bamboo grove the same way he found his daughter. He takes these as proof of her divine royalty and begins planning to make her a proper princess. He relocates the family to the capital, forcing the girl to leave her friends behind, and the family moves into a mansion replete with servants. The girl is saddled with a governess who is tasked with taming her into a noblewoman. The girl struggles with the restraints of nobility, yearning for her prior life in the countryside.\n\nWhen she comes of age, she is granted the formal name {{nihongo|\"Princess Kaguya\"|\u304b\u3050\u3084\u59eb||\"the shining princess\"}}. Miyatsuko holds a celebration, where Kaguya overhears partygoers ridiculing her father's attempts to turn a peasant girl into a noble through money. Kaguya flees the capital in despair and runs back to the mountains, seeking Sutemaru and her friends, but discovers that they have all moved away. She passes out in the snow and awakens back at the party.\n\nKaguya grows in beauty, attracting suitors. Five noblemen attempt to court her, comparing her to mythical treasures. Kaguya tells them she will only marry whoever can bring her the mythical treasure mentioned. Eventually, spring comes, and the Princess wishes to see the cherry blossoms bloom. Her mother and one of her handmaidens take her back to the country, where not far from the hut she once lived, a tree is in bloom. Reveling in its bursting forth with life, she happily whirls amid its petals, until she accidentally stumbles across a small child. The family of the child quickly takes it away, bowing in her presence, reminding the Princess of who and what she is now.\n\nReturning to the capital, the cart the group is in finds itself stuck, when a ruckus is heard outside. Kaguya notices several men running through the streets, and upon seeing one of them, recognizes Sutemaru. Unable to contain herself, she cries out to him, but upon realizing her station in life, quickly retreats into the carriage as it drives off. Sutemaru attempts to go after her, but is beaten for his attempts, as Kaguya cries.\n\nTwo suitors attempt to persuade her with counterfeits, the third abandons his quest, and the fourth gives Kaguya a flower instead of his treasure, but is found by his wife before Kaguya can accept. When the last suitor is killed in his quest, Kaguya becomes [[Depression (mood)|depressed]]. The [[Emperor of Japan|Emperor]] takes notice of Kaguya's beauty and tries to kidnap her but she convinces him to leave.\n\nKaguya reveals to her parents that she originally came from the [[Moon]]. Once a resident there, she broke its laws, hoping to be exiled to Earth so that she could experience mortal life. When the Emperor made his advances, she silently begged the Moon to help her. Having heard her prayer, the Moon restored her memories and said she will be reclaimed during the next [[full moon]]. Kaguya confesses her attachment to Earth and her reluctance to leave; Miyatsuko swears to protect her and begins turning the mansion into a fortress.\n\nKaguya returns to her home village and finds Sutemaru. The two profess their love, and in their joy, they fly over the countryside, only to encounter the Moon and fall. Sutemaru wakes up alone and reunites with his wife and child, interpreting the experience as a dream.\n\nOn the night of the full moon, a procession of celestial beings led by the [[Buddha]] descends from the Moon, and Miyatsuko is unable to stop it. An attendant offers Kaguya a robe that will erase her memories of Earth. She is granted one last moment with her parents before an attendant drapes the robe around her, appearing to erase her memory. They leave, and Miyatsuko and his wife are distraught. Kaguya looks back at Earth one last time, and cries as she remembers her mortal life, which is now only a dream to her.\n\n==Voice cast==\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Character\n!

and the restriction of women, the beauty of life in spite of sorrow, and the duties and responsibilities of parenting.\n\nSome of the most striking themes introduced are feminism and the restriction of women. Evidence of them is when Princess Kaguya and her adoptive parents moved to the capital city in order to find her a husband befitting her royal status. Such a decision confronted Princess Kaguya's wishes, but her father's urge to make her live a princess' lifestyle prevailed.<ref name=\"Yalcinkaya\">{{Cite web|last=Yalcinkaya|first=Gunseli|date=2018-04-12|title=why the themes isao takahata explored were so important|url=https://i-d.vice.com/en_uk/article/8xkkxa/why-the-themes-isao-takahata-explored-were-so-important|access-date=2020-10-03|website=i-D|language=en|archive-date=11 June 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220611103853/https://mb.moatads.com/s/v2?url=https%3A%2F%2Fi-d.vice.com%2Fen_uk%2Farticle%2F8xkkxa%2Fwhy-the-themes-isao-takahata-explored-were-so-important&pcode=viceheader426995670975&ord=1654943928127&jv=386447513&callback=BrandSafetyNadoscallback_51019374|url-status=live}}</ref> Moreover, her mother's submissive role in terms of decision-making is evident in the construction of the theme. Another feminist depiction is a dream sequence scene where Princess Kaguya bursts through a series of doors, representing the barriers she faces from her family and society, depicting the many restrictions women face against their own wishes and desires.<ref name=\"Yalcinkaya\"/>\n\nAnother topic within the film is the illustration of\u00a0how absurd notions of beauty can be, when she is instructed on the principles of beauty and behaviour of women in the Heian period, principles all royal women must follow.<ref name=\"Monji\">{{Cite web|last=Monji|first=Jana J.|date=2014-12-17|title=Interpreting Isao Takahata's 'The Tale of Princess Kaguya'|url=https://ageofthegeek.org/2014/12/17/interpreting-isao-takahatas-the-tale-of-princess-kaguya/|access-date=2020-10-03|website=Pasadena Art & Science Beat|language=en|archive-date=24 October 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201024093405/https://ageofthegeek.org/2014/12/17/interpreting-isao-takahatas-the-tale-of-princess-kaguya/|url-status=live}}</ref> However, the princess expresses her discontent and the pain of having to renounce humanity when expected to stop smiling or expressing any kind of feeling or thought. Moreover, the scene where she sets her suitors impossible tasks shows the fierce determination of a woman in a world dominated by hierarchy and men. Princess Kaguya is independent and introspective, but at times crestfallen and saddened by her living situation.<ref>{{Cite web|title=The Tale of Princess Kaguya|url=https://www.eagle.pitt.edu/sites/default/files/Princess%20Kaguya%20Culture%20Notes.pdf|access-date=2021-08-09|website=East Asia Gateway|archive-date=15 August 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210815000312/https://www.eagle.pitt.edu/sites/default/files/Princess%20Kaguya%20Culture%20Notes.pdf|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe weight of immaterial pleasures over wealth is represented mainly through the drawings. The style of soft lines and muted hues express the simplicity of life in rural Japan where Princess Kaguya finds joy around friends and family. In contrast, life in the palace is represented with bolder colors insinuating indulgence. There, Kaguya finds herself full of luxury and wealth, but she is also shown as caged and isolated and in many scenes the film shows how much she misses the simple rural life. This is represented in the scene where Princess Kaguya escapes from the palace searching for freedom, where Takahata uses spontaneous brush strokes abandoning the carefully drawn charcoal lines. The use of heavy and violent strokes when Princess Kaguya runs shows her frustration and despair for having to live in the palace.<ref name=\"catchinglight.org\">{{Cite web|date=2017-09-14|title=The Tale of Princess Kaguya: The Power of Animation as a Medium|url=http://www.catchinglight.org/tale-princess-kaguya-animation-medium/|access-date=2020-10-03|website=Catching Light|language=en-US|archive-date=20 February 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200220211808/http://www.catchinglight.org/tale-princess-kaguya-animation-medium/|url-status=live}}</ref> To add sadness and despair, her eyes start losing their brightness as the film progresses. There is a sense of drowning in her that is constructed when the Princess overheard a group of drunk men talking about wanting to see her and mocking her father for paying to turn her from a commoner into a princess. She takes a breath, the frame pulls back and her image shrinks into the surrounding darkness. This represents her feeling of being constricted and trapped, the self-awareness of her isolation, and surrender to the loss of the happy simple life she once had. Furthermore, both the life of peasants and aristocrats are represented tragically as poverty prevents love, and the restrictions of class prevent Kaguya from enjoying the life she would have chosen for herself.<ref name=\"Monji\"/>\n\nBeauty in life in spite of pain and suffering is another theme. This is clear in the final scene where the gods come down to earth in order to take Kaguya back to the moon. The gods come on immaculately white clouds, and they are coloured brightly with gentle hues. The joyful music played contrasts the image of the family crying in desperation. Although the deities seem attractive, the dominating mint greens and bold pinks give them an acerbic quality. In contrast, life on Earth is all charcoal. This suggests that life on earth means experiencing loss, grief, sadness and regret. Princess Kaguya, at first, refuses to leave the dark Earth, she states that Earth is full of wonder and beauty.<ref name=\"catchinglight.org\"/> This works as a conclusion as well as a message of hope in humanity.\n\nAnother theme present in the movie is the call of adulthood and responsibility. Kaguya was sent from her world to the world of humans, perhaps as a punishment for misbehaviour, thus, she ignores the responsibilities that await her. So when she faces responsibilities on Earth in the palace, she feels upset but eventually realises they are part of her duty. This is in turn stating that everyone in society needs to grow up and live within its restrictions.<ref name=\"Monji\"/> The theme is also developed with reference to parenting: both parents feel responsible for the princess\u2019 happiness and wellbeing. The moment she arrives they devote themselves to that. Even though her father is blinded by his own understanding of duty for her daughter, he loves her above all and that he never intends to cause her pain. Her mother\u2019s mission, on the other hand, is to accompany her daughter in silence, to listen, to reproduce the home the princess misses so much in the palace's kitchen, where she hides and seeks peace.\n\n==Soundtrack==\n\nIn 2012, [[Shin'ichir\u014d Ikebe|Shin-ichiro Ikebe]] was announced to write the film's score. However, in 2013, [[Joe Hisaishi]] replaced Ikebe as the composer. This would be the only time Hisaishi scored a film directed by Isao Takahata.<ref>{{cite
