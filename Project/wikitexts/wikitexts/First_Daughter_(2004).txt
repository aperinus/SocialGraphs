It stars [[Katie Holmes]] as Samantha MacKenzie, daughter of the President of the United States, who enrolls at college and develops a relationship with another student ([[Marc Blucas]]). The film follows Samantha as she experiences a new sense of freedom during her time away from the White House, and the advantages and disadvantages of her college life. It co-stars [[Michael Keaton]] as the President of the United States and [[Amerie]] as Samantha's roommate, Mia Thompson.\n\nThe film was directed by [[Forest Whitaker]], written by [[Jessica Bendinger]] and Kate Kondell from a story by Bendinger and [[Jerry O'Connell]], and produced by [[John Davis (producer)|John Davis]]. Whitaker likened ''First Daughter'' to a [[fairy tale]], characterizing it as \"the story of a princess who leaves the 'castle' [the White House] to go out in the world to discover who and what she is.\"<ref>[http://www.writingstudio.co.za/page718.html First Daughter] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051120133842/http://www.writingstudio.co.za/page718.html|date=November 20, 2005}}</ref> The film languished in \"[[development hell]]\" for several years, due to competition against ''[[Chasing Liberty]]'',<ref name=BR/> and was further delayed after its completion.{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}} It was not a commercial success upon its release, and received negative reviews.\n\n==Plot==\nSamantha MacKenzie is the only child of [[U.S. President]] John MacKenzie. Because of her father's political career, she has been in the public eye her entire life and spent most of her high school years in the White House. Having to deal with lack of privacy and public scrutiny for the most ridiculous things, Sam has had a sheltered existence and her father has trouble letting her have more freedom yet is too busy to spend time with her.\n\nThough her mother Melanie is supportive, she still stands by her husband's decisions, leaving Sam feeling restricted from having a normal life. Accompanied by [[United States Secret Service|Secret Service]] agents everywhere she goes, and with her father running for re-election, Sam finally believes she has the chance to break out of her cocoon when she is given the opportunity to attend college in California.\n\nAt school, Sam ends up sharing a dorm room with boy-crazed Mia Thompson, who is hesitant at first to room with the first daughter, but eventually warms to her. After her Secret Service agents tackle a student brandishing a water gun at a pool party and hastily evacuate her from the premises, she insists that her detail be reduced to just two agents, which her father begrudgingly agrees to. Settling into some semblance of normalcy, she meets and becomes interested in fellow student James Lansome, her resident advisor.\n\nJames helps her avoid paparazzi, escape her security team, and experience life as a normal girl. They discuss their deepest thoughts and wishes, and Sam tells him that although she is never alone, she is often lonely. She says she always wanted to get in an old Volkswagen and drive herself off to college, with no babysitters or parents. To thank James and Mia for their tolerance of her complicated world, Sam flies them home to D.C. to attend a ball, with the dresses delivered to her personally by Vera Wang. Outside the ball, a protest causes her security team to evacuate her again, when she discovers that James is actually an agent and has been protecting her all along.\n\nHeartbroken and betrayed, Sam tries to readjust to college life, but an attempt to make James jealous only results in her drunken photo splashed across tabloid articles. She returns home to help her father on the last stretch of his campaign, while James is disciplined for failure to act in a manner becoming of an agent. Sam asks her father to make sure James's career is not ruined by their romance, to which he agrees.\n\nThe President wins re-election and dances with Sam at his inauguration ball, referencing something she told him in his speech and acknowledging she is now a grown woman and worthy of his respect. She is surprised and pleased to see that James is in attendance at the ball, having been reassigned to the presidential detail. They dance, and he gives her keys to an old Volkswagen (her dream car) and encourages her to go \"break some rules.\"\n\nThe film ends with Sam driving off in her car heading back to college and the narrator telling us that she will be back in the Spring, and reunite with James.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Katie Holmes]] as Samantha MacKenzie\n*[[Marc Blucas]] as James Lansome\n*[[Amerie]] as Mia Thompson\n*[[Michael Keaton]] as [[U.S President]] John MacKenzie\n*[[Margaret Colin]] as [[First lady of the united states|U.S First Lady]] Melanie MacKenzie\n*[[Lela Rochon]] as Liz Pappas, the President's personal secretary (as Lela Rochon Fuqua)\n*[[Michael Milhoan]] as Agent Bock\n*Dwayne Adway as Agent Dylan\n*[[Barry Livingston]] as Press Secretary\n*[[Steve Tom]] as Senator Downer\n*[[Peter White (actor)|Peter White]] as College Dean\n*[[Parry Shen]] as Rally Leader\n*[[Marilyn McIntyre]] as Teacher at Party\n*[[Teck Holmes]] as Mia's Flame\n*[[Justine Wachsberger]] as Passing Student\n*[[Andy Umberger]] as Secret Service Supervisor\n*[[Kent Shocknek]] as Contentious Reporter\n*[[Vera Wang]] as Herself\n*[[Conan O'Brien]] as Himself\n*[[Joan Rivers]] as Herself\n*[[Melissa Rivers]] as Herself\n*[[Jay Leno]] as Himself\n*[[Forest Whitaker]] as Narrator\n\n==Production==\nThe film began development in March 1999, when actor [[Jerry O'Connell]] sold a screenplay he had written to [[Regency Enterprises]] for a six figure sum, with O'Connell also intending to star in the film. Originally to shoot in the summer of that year, the project was pushed back to the spring of 2000 (under the direction of [[Brian Robbins]]) to allow O'Connell to film ''[[Mission to Mars]],'' and then [[Rob Thomas (writer)|Rob Thomas]] was hired to rewrite the script.<ref>{{cite news|work=The Hollywood Reporter|url=http://www.melissajoanhart.net/news/hollywood_reporter/036.shtml|title=Robbins guards 'First Daughter'|last=Kit|first=Zorianna|date=August 24, 1999|accessdate=August 23, 2021}}</ref><ref>[http://www.earth62.net/transcripts/oconnell20oct99.htm Jerry O'Connell Chat at AOL on October 20, 1999] ''earth62.net'' Retrieved August 23, 2021.</ref> For unknown reasons, the film was not produced at that time, although O'Connell later received a \"story by\" credit for the film from the [[Writers Guild of America]].
