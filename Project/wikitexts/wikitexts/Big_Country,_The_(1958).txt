The opening title sequence was created by [[Saul Bass]].\n\nBurl Ives won the [[Academy Award]] as [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Supporting Actor]] for his performance, as well as the [[Golden Globe Award]]. The film was also nominated for an [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Academy Award for the musical score]], composed by [[Jerome Moross]]. The film is one of the few in which Heston plays a major supporting role rather than the lead.\n\n==Plot==\nFormer sea captain James McKay travels to the [[American Old West|American West]] to join his fianc\u00e9e Patricia at the enormous ranch owned by her father, Henry Terrill, referred to by all as \"The Major\". After a meeting with Patricia's friend, schoolteacher Julie Maragon, McKay and Patricia are accosted by a group of drunks led by Buck Hannassey, the son of the Major's ardent and implacable enemy Rufus Hannassey. In spite of the harassment and mockery, McKay surprises Patricia by making light of the incident and stating that he's experienced worse and the boys meant no harm.\n\nThe next morning, McKay declines an invitation from the Major's foreman Steve Leech to ride an indomitable bronco stallion named \"Old Thunder\". McKay then brings a pair of dueling pistols to the Major as a gift. When the Major learns of Buck's pestering of his daughter and future son-in-law, he gathers his men and goes to raid the Hannassey ranch despite McKay's attempts to defuse the situation. The Major's group finds neither Rufus nor Buck, so they settle for terrorizing the Hannassey women and children, shooting holes in the Hannassey water reservoir. They find Buck's posse in town and proceed to beat and humiliate them. Meanwhile, McKay privately tames and rides Old Thunder after many unsuccessful attempts, and swears his only witness, the ranch hand Ramon, to secrecy.\n\nA gala is held on the Terrill ranch in honor of Patricia's upcoming wedding. At the height of the festivities, an armed Rufus crashes the party and accuses the Major of the hypocrisy of pretending to be a gentleman when his actions speak otherwise. The next day, McKay secretly goes to Maragon's abandoned ranch, known as the \"Big Muddy\". The Big Muddy's territory is the location of the town's only nearby river, and as such it is a vital source of water for both the Terrill and Hannassey cattle during times of drought. McKay persuades Maragon to sell the ranch to him in the hopes of both securing a gift for Patricia and ending the conflict by continuing Maragon's policy of unrestricted access to the river. McKay shows up at the camp of the search party led by Leech sent out to find the presumed lost McKay.\n\nUpon returning to Ladder Ranch, Leech calls McKay a liar when McKay explains he was never lost or in danger, but McKay again refuses to be goaded into a fight, which disappoints Patricia enough to make the pair reconsider their engagement. Before dawn and without an audience, McKay challenges Leech to a prolonged outdoor fistfight, which ends in a draw. In the morning, Maragon tells Patricia of McKay's purchase of the Big Muddy for her, which initially convinces her to attempt to make amends with McKay. However, when she learns of McKay's plan to allow the Hannasseys equal access to the water, she leaves for good.\n\nWanting to lure the Major into an ambush in the canyon leading to his homestead, Rufus takes Maragon hostage. Although McKay personally promises Rufus equal access to the water, he finds himself in a clash with Buck, which is ultimately settled with a duel. Buck fires before the signal, but misses, his bullet grazing McKay's forehead and leaving him open to be shot by McKay. Buck's subsequent display of cowardice convinces McKay to spare Buck. The frustrated Buck snatches another gun from a nearby civilian, forcing Rufus to kill his son. Rufus goes to the canyon for a final confrontation with the Major and challenges him to a one-on-one showdown. Armed with rifles, the two old men advance and kill one another. McKay, along with Julie and Ramon, ride off to start a new life together.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Gregory Peck]] as James McKay\n* [[Jean Simmons]] as Julie Maragon\n* [[Carroll Baker]] as Patricia Terrill\n* [[Charlton Heston]] as Steve Leech\n* [[Burl Ives]] as Rufus Hannassey\n* [[Charles Bickford]] as Maj.

After arbitration, Webb, Bartlett and Wilder received screenplay credit and Wyler and West received adaptation credit.

Many of the actors, including Jean Simmons and Carroll Baker, were so traumatized by his directing style that they refused to speak about the experience for years. Simmons later said they constantly received rewrites for the script, making acting extremely difficult. Gregory Peck and Wyler, who were good friends, fought constantly on the set and had a falling out for three years, although they later reconciled. Wyler and Charles Bickford also clashed, as they had done 30 years previously on the production of his 1929 film ''[[Hell's Heroes (film)|Hell's Heroes]]''. Burl Ives, however, claimed to have enjoyed making the film.\n\nBefore principal photography was complete, Wyler left for Rome to start work on ''[[Ben-Hur (1959 film)|Ben-Hur]]'', delegating creation of the final scenes involving McKay and Julie to his assistant [[Robert Swink]], whose resulting scenes pleased Wyler so much that he wrote Swink a letter stating: \"I can't begin to tell you how pleased I am with the new ending...
