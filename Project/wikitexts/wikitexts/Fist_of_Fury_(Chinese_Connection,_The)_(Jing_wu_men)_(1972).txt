It was the highest-grossing [[Hong Kong film]] up until Lee's ''[[The Way of the Dragon]]'' (1972).\n\n==Plot==\nSet in late Summer 1910 [[Shanghai]], [[Chen Zhen (character)|Chen Zhen]] returns to [[Chin Woo Athletic Association|Jingwu School]] to marry his fianc\u00e9e Yuan Li'er. However, he learns that his master [[Huo Yuanjia]] has died, apparently from illness, which devastates Chen. During the funeral, people from a Japanese [[dojo]] in [[Hongkou District]] arrive to taunt the Jingwu students. Wu En, translator and advisor for the Japanese dojo's grandmaster Hiroshi Suzuki, taunts Chen by slapping him on the cheek several times, and dares him to fight one of Suzuki's prot\u00e9g\u00e9s. They present a sign to Jingwu School, bearing the words \"[[Sick man of Asia|Sick Man of East Asia]]\", seemingly to insult Huo Yuanjia, describing the Chinese as \"weaklings\" in comparison to the Japanese. The prot\u00e9g\u00e9 taunts the Jingwu students to fight him and promises, \"I'll eat those words if any Chinese here dare to fight and defeat me\". Chen Zhen wants to retaliate, but is prevented from doing so by Fan Junxia, the most senior student in the school.\n \nShortly afterwards, Chen Zhen goes to the Hongkou dojo alone to return the sign. He winds up fighting the Japanese students, defeating all of them, including their [[sensei]], single-handedly. He smashes the glass on the sign and makes the students who taunted him earlier chew up the paper bearing the derogatory words, so as to make them literally \"eat their words\".\n\nLater, Chen takes a stroll to a park. A [[Sikh]] guard refuses him entry, due to a posted sign that forbids dogs and Chinese in the park. After the guard allows a foreigner to bring her pet dog into the park, a Japanese man approaches Chen and tells him that if he behaves like a dog, he will be allowed to go in. Chen beats up the man and his friends in anger. After the fight, Chen breaks the sign. The guard blows his whistle to alert the police, but the citizens who watched the whole fight help Chen to escape the park.\n\nThe Japanese students and their master retaliate by attacking Jingwu School on Suzuki's orders. After causing severe damage, the Japanese students leave. Wu, accompanying the Japanese students, warns Jingwu School to hand over Chen. Chen returns and realises that he has caused big trouble. His fellow students refuse to hand him over to the Japanese, so they make plans to help him escape from Shanghai.\n\nThat night, Chen discovers that Master Huo had actually been poisoned by Tian, the cook. Chen then sees Tian and Feng Guishi, the caretaker, talking. Chen kills Tian, followed by Feng while trying to determine why they killed Master Huo. Chen hangs Tian and Feng's bodies from a lamp post. Chen's fianc\u00e9e, Yuan Li'er, finds him hiding near Huo's grave, and they share a passionate moment together. Meanwhile, Suzuki forces the local police inspector, Inspector Lo, to arrest Chen, but he eludes them. Then, while Suzuki is entertaining his visiting friend Petrov, Chen kills Wu and hangs his body from the lamp post as well.\n\nThe angry Suzuki heads to the Japanese Consulate and reports Chen, then on Tian's brother's advice sends his men to Jingwu School to kill everyone inside. That same night, Chen barges into the dojo to take his revenge, killing the students' master present, Yoshida, Petrov, and Suzuki. Chen returns to Jingwu School and finds most from Jingwu School and the Hongkou dojo dead. However, a few Jingwu students - among them Yuan, Fan Junxia, and Xu - are still alive, as they had also been searching for Chen at the grave site, acting on a tip from Yuan. Inspector Lo arrives at Jingwu to arrest Chen, who agrees to surrender himself to Lo to protect his master's legacy. Lo tells Chen that he can always trust him since he is Chinese. As they exit the school, Chen faces a line of armed Japanese soldiers and officials at the outer gate, all pointing their guns at him. Furious, Chen charges the line and makes a flying kick. The film ends on a [[freeze-frame shot]] and the sound of gun shots, implying his death and final sacrifice.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Bruce Lee]] as [[Chen Zhen (character)|Chen Zhen]]\n*[[Nora Miao]] as Yuan Li'er (Yuan Le-erh), Chen Zhen's fianc\u00e9e.

It was the highest-grossing Hong Kong film up until Lee's ''[[The Way of the Dragon]]'' (1972).\n\n===Critical response===\nUpon release in Asia, a review for ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' magazine in November 1972 called it a \"Naive Hong Kong-made [[melodrama|meller]], of little U.S. commercial appeal\" despite the \"charm of Lee's invincible heroics.\" The reviewer felt that it was an \"exuberant novelty act\" unlikely to find [[Western culture|Western]] appeal but that Lee's \"aggressive boyish charm\" could \"prove appealing to U.S. femmes.\"<ref name=\"Desser\" />\n\nUpon release in North America, John Gillett of the ''[[Monthly Film Bulletin]]'' reviewed a 106 minute dubbed version of the film in May 1973.<ref name=\"mfb\">{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Monthly Film Bulletin]]|title=Fist of Fury|page=96|last=Gillet|first=John|volume=40|issue=472|date=May 1973|publisher=[[British Film Institute]]}}</ref> Gillett commented on Bruce Lee stating that he had \"somewhat rudimentary and charmless acting style (all curled lips, sinister glances and clenched fists), but he performs his main function-that of keeping the action going through a series of furious karate fights-with considerable aplomb and proves as adept with his feet as with his fists.\"<ref name=\"mfb\" /> While finding the story \"extremely naive\" and that the \"[[anti-Japanese]] bias is more rather more pronounced\" while the fight sequences \"are staged with tremendous vigour (and a judicious use of slow-motion)\" concluding that \"the production values are only moderate, with a rather uneasy fusion of studio interiors and real street locations, and the English dubbing is unusually inept.\"<ref name=\"mfb\" />\n\nThe film has an aggregated review score of 83% based on 18 critic reviews on [[Rotten Tomatoes]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=The Chinese Connection on Rotten Tomatoes|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/chinese_connection|url-status=live|access-date=December 24, 2021|website=Rotten Tomatoes}}</ref>\n\nThe film may have been the only one which [[Mao Zedong|Chairman Mao]] watched three times.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/life/2010-12/17/content_11716141.htm|title=The Man who was Mao's Hero|publisher=China Daily|author=Raymond Zhou|date=December 17, 2010}}</ref>\n\n===Themes===\n''Fist of Fury'' deals with topics of injustice, grief, revenge and consequences. Chen Zhen goes through a great deal of grief after the death of his master. This grief eats away at Zhen as well as the injustice he and his peers deal with from the Japanese racism towards them.
