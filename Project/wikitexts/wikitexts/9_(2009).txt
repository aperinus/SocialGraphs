In the film, [[Elijah Wood]] voices a small ragdoll-like robot who awakens shortly after the end of mankind, and must find eight other robots to figure out the mystery behind humanity's destruction while tangling with the vicious creations of a massive soul-stealing machine.

The film received generally mixed to positive reviews from critics and earned $48.4 million on a $30 million budget. It also received an [[Annie Award]] nomination for Best Animated Effects in a Feature Production. The film was released on [[DVD]] and [[Blu-ray]] on December 29, 2009.\n\n==Plot==\nA scientist is ordered by his [[dictator]] to create a robot in the apparent name of progress, and so the scientist creates the B.R.A.I.N., a highly intelligent robot. The dictator seizes it upon its apparent completion and turns it into the Fabrication Machine, an armature that can construct an army of war machines to destroy the dictator's enemies. However, the B.R.A.I.N. became corrupted because it lacked a soul, causing it to exterminate humanity. On the verge of destruction, the scientist uses [[alchemy]] to create nine [[homunculus]]-like rag dolls known as \"Stitchpunks\" as a last resort to stopping the machines, giving them portions of his own soul via a talisman he created. He dies upon completion of the final doll.\n\nSome time later, the final Stitchpunk, 9, awakens in the workshop and ventures into the devastated city where he meets 2, a frail inventor who gives him a working voice box. The last active machine, the Cat-Beast, attacks the pair and abducts both 2 and takes the talisman. 9 collapses, but awakens in Sanctuary, the tower of an empty [[cathedral]] that is home to other Stitchpunks - the dogmatic leader 1, his large bodyguard 8, the cycloptic engineer 5, and the mentally unstable [[oracle]] 6. 9, having seen the condemned [[factory]] where the Cat-Beast took 2, decides to rescue him. 9 and 5 venture to the factory where they find 2. The Cat-Beast attacks the trio, but are saved by 7, the only female of the Stitchpunks. 9, drawn by curiosity, connects the talisman to the derelict Fabrication Machine, reviving it, and it subsequently kills 2 by sucking out his soul. 9, 5, and 7 manage to escape the factory.\n\n7 takes 9 and 5 to an abandoned [[library]], where the silent scholar twins, 3 and 4, have taken residence, and show 9 the Fabrication Machine's origins. 5 realizes the talisman's symbols match the clairvoyant drawings of 6. 9 and 5 return to Sanctuary to investigate, but 1 intervenes and reprimands them for disobeying his orders. Meanwhile, the Fabrication Machine assembles new robotic creatures; one of them, the bird-like Winged Beast, attacks the Sanctuary. 7 joins the fight and Stitchpunks defeats the Winged Beast. \n\nAs the group retreats to the library, 6, 3, and 4 cryptically explain the talisman's origins, but 1 reveals to the group that he sent 2 out of Sanctuary on a scouting trip to die. 7, shocked by this, attacks 1, but flees when 9 intervenes. Meanwhile, the Fabrication Machine retrieves 2's corpse and uses it as a hypnotic lure for another one of its robot creatures, known as The Seamstress. The Seamstress attacks the library and captures both 7 and 8, but 2's body is recovered and given a funeral by the others. The others then run to the factory to destroy the machines. 9 goes in alone, kills the Seamstress, and rescues 7, but not before 8's soul is absorbed by the Fabrication Machine. 9 and 7 escape while the others destroy the factory.\n\nThe Fabrication Machine, which survived, suddenly emerges from the ruins of the factory and absorbs 5's soul. The Fabrication Machine attacks the group as they run away and manages to capture 6. 6 tells 9 to go to the Scientist's workshop to find answers, before being absorbed by the Fabrication Machine. 9 follows 6's instructions, finding a holographic recorded message from the Scientist, explaining B.R.A.I.N.'s origins and that the Stitchpunks have his soul, making them the only hope for humanity. Following this revelation, 9 uncovers the purpose of the talisman and returns to his friends.\n\n9 reunites with the other Stitchpunks and decides to sacrifice himself so the others can retrieve the talisman. Having had a change of heart, 1 redeems himself by saving 9, pushing him out of the way and allowing himself to be absorbed while 9 removes the talisman. 9 activates the talisman and reabsorbs the souls taken by the Machine, resulting in its final destruction. Afterwards, 9, 7, 3, and 4 free the souls of 5, 1, 6, 2, and 8 from the talisman as they fly up into the sky, causing it to rain. The final image shows that the raindrops contain small flecks of glowing [[bacteria]], bringing life back into the world.\n\n==Cast and characters==\n===Stitchpunks===\n* '''1''' ([[Christopher Plummer]]) is the fearful, arrogant portion of the Scientist's personality. He is the self-appointed leader of the group, demanding absolute loyalty from the others and frequently clashing with 9, who refuses to follow him. He is seen to be quite rude, lacking guilt for his actions when the others do not do as he is asked.\n* '''2''' ([[Martin Landau]]) is the creative and genius portion of the Scientist's personality. He is a kind, delicate old inventor. He is fascinated by garbage and scrap, and loves to explore the wastelands and look for parts for his inventions. He is the first one of the group to die.\n* '''3''' and '''4''' are twins, and the historians of the group and parts of the Scientist's personality. Both are unable to speak, but are capable of using flickering lights in their eyes to communicate with each other. They project images from their eyes to share information with the other Stitchpunks. They are very intelligent and energetic. They were found alongside 5 by 7 during a battle between man and machine. Their genders are never revealed. They are also one of the only members of the group to not die.\n* '''5''' ([[John C. Reilly]]) is the healer part of the Scientist's personality. 5 is caring, nurturing, and the loyal, bighearted \"common man\" who always tries to play the peacemaker. He is seen as the most frightened by the situation, as shown throughout the movie. He lost an eye during a battle between man and machine after 7 found him with 3 and 4. Despite being afraid of conflict, he is skilled with his weapons of choice and is seen to mend the other members of the group when they are hurt.\n* '''6''' ([[Crispin Glover]]) is the artistic portion of the Scientist's personality. He sees things that the others in the group do not see. 6's fingers are made of ink pen nibs, which he uses to draw. His eyes are disproportionate in size, possibly to represent his mental instability.\n* '''7''' ([[Jennifer Connelly]]) is the fighter part of the Scientist's personality and (possibly) the only female of the group. A rebel and a loner, she is willing to take many risks for the good of her people. She seems very attached to 3 and 4 and acts as a mother or older sister figure to them.\n* '''8''' ([[Fred Tatasciore]]) is the brutish ruffian from the Scientist's personality. He is a master of weapons and wields one half of a scissor and a knife. He is the largest of the group, but the least intelligent. He is also responsible for protecting 1 as seen in a battle with the winged metal monster.\n* '''9''' ([[Elijah Wood]]) is the youngest of the group that represents the Scientist's humanity, big-heartedness, thoughtfulness, and sincerity. He is very intelligent, but he can make mistakes due to his curiosity. He seeks the truth in the history of his creation, and wishes to know the meaning of life.\n\n===Humans===\n* '''The Scientist''' ([[Alan Oppenheimer]]) invented the Fabrication Machine and later the nine stitchpunks to fight against the Fabrication Machine, hoping that they would continue the spark of life. Each of his creations contains a portion of his human soul, embodying both his qualities and flaws. The Fabrication Machine only contains his intellect but no soul, which he later regrets not giving, as it led to the Machine's corruption.\n* '''The Chancellor''' ([[Tom Kane]]), who is a [[dictator]], was responsible for causing the Fabrication Machine to turn against humanity after refusing to honor the Scientist's deal during the creation of the Fabrication Machine.\n\n==Music==\n{{Infobox album\n| name       = 9: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack\n| type       = Soundtrack\n| artist     = [[Danny Elfman]] and Deborah Lurie\n| cover      =\n| caption    = \n| alt        =\n| released   = {{Start date|2009|8|31}}<ref>[https://www.amazon.com/9-Original-Motion-Picture-Soundtrack/dp/B002MHPK6S 9: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack on Amazon.com] [[Amazon.com]] Retrieved September 17, 2014</ref>\n| recorded   = 2008-2009\n| venue      =\n| studio     =\n| genre      = [[Film soundtrack]]\n| length     = 49:28\n| label      = [[Entertainment One Music|E1 Music]]\n| producer   = Deborah Lurie\n| prev_title = [[Terminator Salvation]]\n| prev_year  = 2009\n| next_title =\n| next_year  =\n}}\nThe film soundtrack was released only on [[iTunes]]<ref>[https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/9-original-motion-picture/id328548787 iTunes - Music - 9 (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack) by Danny Elfman & Deborah Lurie] ''[[iTunes]]'' Retrieved September 17, 2014</ref> and on [[Amazon.com|Amazon]] nine days before the film was released.

The song plays in a lighthearted scene when the surviving stitchpunks were celebrating the destruction of the factory and played it on a [[Phonograph record#78 rpm disc developments|78rpm]] [[phonograph]] record.\n\n{{Track listing\n| extra_column = \n| length20 = \n| total_length = 49:28\n| all_writing = \n| all_music = Danny Elfman and Deborah Lurie, except \"Welcome Home\" (lyrics by [[Claudio Sanchez]], music by Coheed and Cambria)\n| title1 = Introduction\n| length1 = 1:42\n| title2 = Finding Answers\n| length2 = 1:48\n| title3 = Sanctuary\n| length3 = 2:12\n| title4 = Winged Beast\n| length4 = 4:28\n| title5 = Reunion/Searching for Two\n| length5 = 2:12\n| title6 = The Machines\n| length6 = 0:58\n| title7 = Out There\n| length7 = 2:42\n| title8 = Twins\n| length8 = 1:36\n| title9 = Slaying the Beast\n| length9 = 1:21\n| title10 = Return of the Machines\n| length10 = 2:47\n| title11 = Burial\n| length11 = 1:24\n| title12 = Reawakening\n| length12 = 3:10\n| title13 = The Aftermath\n| length13 = 1:41\n| title14 = Confrontation\n| length14 = 1:53\n| title15 = The Seamstress\n| length15 = 2:05\n| title16 = Return to the Workshop\n| length16 = 1:54\n| title17 = The Purpose\n| length17 = 5:20\n| title18 = Release\n| length18 = 4:00\n| title19 = [[Welcome Home (Coheed and Cambria song)|Welcome Home]]\n| note19 = performed by [[Coheed and Cambria]]\n| length19 = 6:15\n| title20 = \n}}\n\n==Marketing==\nOn December 25, 2008, a [[trailer (film)|trailer]] was released on [[Apple, Inc.|Apple.com]] that features [[The Knife]]'s \"The Captain\" and [[Coheed and Cambria]]'s \"[[Welcome Home (Coheed and Cambria song)|Welcome Home]]\".<ref name=\"trailer1\">{{cite news |title=Apple - Trailers - 9 |publisher=Apple |url=https://www.apple.com/trailers/focus_features/9/ |access-date=December 27, 2008| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20081227001756/http://www.apple.com/trailers/focus_features/9/| archive-date=December 27, 2008 | url-status= live}}</ref>\n\n''9'' is the second animated feature film to be released by [[Focus Features]], the first being ''[[Coraline (film)|Coraline]]'', written and directed by [[Henry Selick]] and based on the book by [[Neil Gaiman]]. The trailer for ''9'' preceded ''Coraline'' when it was shown in theaters and released on DVD. A second trailer for ''9'' first appeared on [[G4 (American TV channel)|G4]]'s ''[[Attack of the Show]]'' and was later shown before ''[[Land of the Lost (film)|Land of the Lost]]''. It is an extensive trailer which includes a bit of the background story behind the existence of the creations. In April 2009, the film's \"Scientist\" began making journal entries on a [[Facebook]] page called \"9 Scientist\", including [[essay]]s about each of his nine creations.

I mean, the way we end the film, there is a slight suggestion that it may be a new beginning.
