The killer, David Berkowitz, his murders and the investigation are shown in the film but the focus is on two young men from the neighborhood: Vinny ([[John Leguizamo]]), whose marriage is faltering due to his cheating, and Ritchie ([[Adrien Brody]]), Vinny's childhood friend who has embraced [[punk rock|punk]] fashion and music.\n\nThe murder investigation and other contemporary events, such as the [[New York City blackout of 1977]] and the [[New York Yankees]]' [[1977 New York Yankees season|winning season]], provide a backdrop to the stories of Vinny, Ritchie, their families and friends.<ref name=tunzelmann>{{cite news |last=Von Tunzelmann |first=Alex |date=2012-04-26 |title=Summer of Sam is an almost boringly flawless portrait of a real-life monster |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/apr/26/summer-sam-spike-lee |newspaper=The Guardian |location=London |access-date=2017-02-19 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20141007190035/http://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/apr/26/summer-sam-spike-lee |archive-date=2014-10-07 }}</ref> The film was directed and co-produced by [[Spike Lee]], who also co-wrote the film with [[Michael Imperioli]] and [[Victor Colicchio]].\n\n==Plot==\nIt is the summer of 1977, and New York City lives in fear of the \".44 Caliber Killer\", who shoots young women and their male companions. The killer, [[David Berkowitz]], later identifies himself as \"Son of Sam\" in a note left at a murder scene. Berkowitz lives in a messy apartment, where he is driven crazy by the barking of a neighbor's large black labrador, Harvey, the dog of Sam Carr, and has a vision of the dog directing him to kill.\n\nIn an Italian-American neighborhood in the Bronx (likely [[Morris Park, Bronx|Morris Park]], [[Throggs Neck]], or [[Pelham Bay (neighborhood), Bronx|Pelham Bay]]), hairdresser Vinny and his pretty wife Dionna go [[Disco dance|disco dancing]] at a local nightclub, where they meet Dionna's attractive cousin Chiara. Vinny offers to drive Chiara home while Dionna remains at the club. Vinny and Chiara then park on a residential street and have sex in the car. Son of Sam watches them but is scared off when the couple accidentally set off the car horn during sex and quickly drive away, embarrassed. After they leave, Son of Sam kills another couple who had parked behind Vinny. When Vinny picks up Dionna back at the club, she notices the smell of [[vaginal lubrication]] on his face and realizes he had sex with Chiara but does not let on that she knows.\n\nOn the drive home, Vinny notices police near the location where he had parked with Chiara and sees the bodies of the slain couple. The religious and guilty Vinny, realizing he could have been a victim, decides that God spared him in order to give him a chance to reform his ways and stop cheating on his wife. Although Vinny loves Dionna, their sex life is suffering because Vinny enjoys [[anal sex]], [[69 (sex position)|\"69\"]] and other sex acts that he considers kinky but he cannot bring himself to discuss or perform with his wife. He is also having an affair with Gloria, the owner of the hair salon where he works.\n\nThe next day, while Vinny is hanging out with neighborhood drug dealer Joey T and his friends, Vinny's old friend Ritchie, who has been away for some time, reappears, sporting a punk spiked hairdo and clothing and affecting a British accent. Vinny, Joey T, and the others dislike the change in Ritchie and he soon finds himself unwelcome in the neighborhood. Ruby, a promiscuous local girl, is attracted to Ritchie and the two begin a relationship. Unlike other men, Ritchie takes an interest in Ruby as a person, not just as a sexual outlet. She learns that he makes money by erotic dancing and prostituting himself at a gay theater but remains loyal to him and begins to dress in punk fashion herself.\n\nAs the Son of Sam killings continue, tension rises in the neighborhood. A local police detective asks the local mob boss to help him find the killer; Joey T and his friends also make a list of possible suspects, including Ritchie whom they regard as \"a freak\". Ritchie and Ruby invite Vinny and Dionna to come see their punk band perform at [[CBGB]], but once there, Dionna feels intimidated by the punk crowd and refuses to go in. Vinny and Dionna instead go to [[Studio 54]], where they are denied entry and finally end up at [[Plato's Retreat]] where they take drugs and participate in an orgy. Vinny becomes upset when he sees Dionna appearing to enjoy the experience of having sex with another man, even though he himself is having sex with other women. He berates Dionna in the car on the way home, causing her to get mad and reveal that she knows he cheated on her with Chiara. She storms off to stay at her father's house. Vinny begins to drink, uses drugs and makes a scene at Gloria's hair salon, causing her to angrily throw him out and then inform Dionna about their affair. Upon hearing from Gloria, Dionna leaves Vinny for good.\n\nJoey T and his gang decide that the latest witness sketch of Son of Sam released by the police resembles Ritchie and attempt to track him down at CBGB. Joey persuades the unstable Vinny, who is high on drugs he has taken to dull the pain of his impending divorce, to help them lure Ritchie out of his house, since Vinny is the only local friend Ritchie still trusts. Unbeknownst to Vinny and his friends, the police have already arrested David Berkowitz, the real Son of Sam.  Vinny goes to Ritchie's family home, where Ritchie and Ruby are packing up to leave town, and lures Ritchie out on the pretext of talking about his failing marriage. Once Ritchie is outside, Vinny warns Ritchie under his breath to run, but Ritchie does not heed the warning and is attacked and severely beaten by Joey T and his gang. Ritchie's stepfather, Eddie, emerges from the house brandishing his gun and rescues the badly injured Ritchie, telling the attackers that Ritchie is not the Son of Sam and that the TV news is reporting that the police have just arrested the real killer. Unable to face Ritchie, Vinny walks away.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[John Leguizamo]] as Vinny\n* [[Adrien Brody]] as Ritchie\n* [[Mira Sorvino]] as Dionna\n* [[Jennifer Esposito]] as Ruby\n* [[Michael Rispoli]] as Joey T\n* [[Saverio Guerra]] as Woodstock\n* [[Brian Tarantina]] as Bobby Del Fiore\n* Al Palagonia as Anthony\n* Ken Garito as Brian\n* [[Bebe Neuwirth]] as Gloria\n* [[Patti LuPone]] as Helen\n* [[Mike Starr (actor)|Mike Starr]] as Eddie\n* [[Anthony LaPaglia]] as Detective Lou Petrocelli\n* [[Roger Guenveur Smith]] as Detective Curt Atwater\n* [[Ben Gazzara]] as Luigi\n* [[Joe Lisi]] as Tony Olives\n* James Reno as Crony\n* [[Arthur J.

Barton Palmer in 2011, it continues to be widely viewed as Spike Lee's most controversial film, \"issuing a cynical appeal to trashy tastes\", which has \"prevented some critics from according it more than cursory consideration\". Many critics objected to its frankly unromantic, starkly realistic (if hardly pornographic, in the usual sense) handling of sexual themes, as well as for its pervasive street language\" and \"what some saw as [Lee's] bitterly negative and even defamatory representations of white ethnic culture\".<ref>{{cite book|page=54|last=Palmer|first=R.
