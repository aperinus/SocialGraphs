The film was released on September 14, 2007 to mostly negative reviews.\n\n==Plot==\nJohn Farley is a successful self-help author of the bestseller ''Letting Go: How to Get Past Your Past'', who returns to his hometown in [[Nebraska]] to receive an award. Farley arrives home and learns that his widowed mother Beverly is dating his former P.E. teacher Jasper Woodcock. Farley disapproves of the relationship because he remembers Woodcock as an abusive bully.\n\nWoodcock and Beverly become engaged and the majority of the film centers on Farley's attempts to convince his mother to break off the relationship, with the help of his best friend, Nedderman. Farley becomes increasingly obsessed with beating Woodcock at various competitions and with proving that Woodcock is not a suitable mate for Beverly. Farley's antics are so childish and extreme that his new love interest Tracy, a former classmate, refuses to see him again.\n\nFarley is set to receive his award at the same ceremony where Woodcock will be presented with an award for being \"Educator of the Year.\" Woodcock receives his award first and is praised by numerous members of the community for being a great teacher and influence on children. Farley is unconvinced and devotes his entire acceptance speech to explaining why Woodcock is the \"biggest asshole on the planet.\" Woodcock and various crowd members refute Farley's points, and Woodcock then challenges Farley to a fight. Beverly witnesses the confrontation and dumps Woodcock.\n\nThe next day, Farley has a heart-to-heart conversation with his mother, who tells him that he is selfish and has always sabotaged her relationships with men after his father's death. Farley realizes she is correct, and after cutting short a live interview on ''[[The Tyra Banks Show]]'', Farley attempts to apologize to Woodcock. The two have a final exorcising fight, which leads to Woodcock suffering a concussion. Farley and Beverly visit Woodcock in the hospital and all three seemingly make peace. Farley declares that the key to life is not \"getting past your past\" but instead learning to embrace your past. He opines that Woodcock's vicious treatment in gym class helped him become the man he is today.\n\nWoodcock and Beverly get married, Farley reunites with Tracy, and Farley goes on to write a second book entitled ''Backbone: The Definite Guide to Self Confidence.''\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Billy Bob Thornton]] as Jasper Woodcock\n* [[Seann William Scott]] as John Farley\n* [[Susan Sarandon]] as Beverly Farley\n* [[Ethan Suplee]] as Nedderman\n* [[Amy Poehler]] as Maggie Hoffman\n* [[Melissa Sagemiller]] as Tracy Detweiller\n* [[Bill Macy]] as Mr. Woodcock's father\n* [[Tyra Banks]] as Herself\n* Kyley Baldridge as Young John Farley\n* Alec George as Young Nedderman\n* [[Melissa Leo]] as Sally Jansen\n* [[Jennifer Aspen]] as Cindy\n* [[Allisyn Ashley Arm]] as Scout Girl\n* [[M.

He left the project after negative test screenings, and many scenes were re-written and re-shot. [[David Dobkin (director)|David Dobkin]] replaced Gillespie in the director's role. Upon initially receiving the script, Gillespie had assumed that audiences would respond well to the dark humor he had been using in his commercials, but, according to him, \"it was obvious the audience wanted a broader comedy, not the one I'd made. I appreciated the predicament New Line was in, so I stepped aside.\" Dobkin, however, went uncredited, leading Gillespie to take the blame.\n\n==Home media==\n{{Anchor|DVD|Video}} \nThe [[Blu-ray Disc]] and [[DVD]] were released on January 15, 2008. The [[HD DVD]] version of the movie was scheduled to be released shortly after the Blu-ray version, but Warner Bros./New Line's decision to exclusively support Blu-ray led to the cancellation of all New Line HD DVD titles (along with all Warner Bros. HD DVD titles after May 2008).{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title}}\n* {{amg movie|325008}}\n* {{Rotten Tomatoes}}\n* {{Metacritic film}}\n* {{mojo title|mrwoodcock}}\n\n{{Craig Gillespie}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Mister Woodcock}}\n[[Category:2007 films]]\n[[Category:American sports comedy films]]\n[[Category:2000s sports comedy films]]\n[[Category:Films set in the 1990s]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Craig Gillespie]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Theodore Shapiro]]\n[[Category:New Line Cinema films]]\n[[Category:2007 directorial debut films]]\n[[Category:2007 comedy films]]\n[[Category:2000s English-language films]]\n[[Category:2000s American films]]"}]}}}}
