MGM retained the rights to the first film and, as such, distributed the 2019 reboot.\n\n== Plot ==\nDetective Mike Norris chases fugitive serial killer [[Chucky (character)|Charles Lee Ray]] through the streets of [[Chicago]] and into a [[toy store]]. After being shot by Norris, a dying Ray performs a [[Haitian Vodou|voodoo chant]] to transfer his soul to one of the ''Good Guy''-brand [[doll|talking dolls]] on display. The store is struck by lightning and explodes, and Norris finds Ray's lifeless body in the rubble next to the doll.\n\nWidow Karen Barclay's six-year-old son [[Andy Barclay|Andy]] desperately wants a ''Good Guy'' doll for his birthday, but she cannot afford one. Soon after, she learns that a homeless man outside of her workplace has gotten ahold of a ''Good Guy'' doll and is trying to sell it. She buys it and gives it to Andy. The doll appears normal and refers to itself as \"Chucky\". That night, Karen's best friend Maggie watches over Andy while Karen works late. After Andy's bedtime, Maggie finds Chucky sitting in front of a television tuned to a late-night newscast about Ray's death. She is then attacked by Chucky, causing her to fall out of the window to her death. Police search the apartment and Norris considers Andy a suspect, despite Karen's protests. Andy claims that Chucky killed Maggie and says that Chucky told him that his real name was \"Charles Lee Ray\".\n\nThe next morning, Chucky orders Andy to skip school and take a train downtown. While Andy is distracted, Chucky sneaks into the home of his former accomplice, Eddie Caputo, and kills him by causing a [[gas explosion]]. Andy is again considered a suspect and is admitted to a [[psychiatric hospital]] after claiming Chucky is the culprit. Karen returns home with Chucky and discovers batteries in the doll's box; the doll has been moving and speaking without them. Frightened, Karen lights her fireplace and threatens to burn Chucky, who violently comes alive in her arms and attacks her before escaping. Karen goes to the police and explains what happened; Norris doesn't believe her. Karen finds the man who sold her the doll and asks for more information. Norris arrives and interrogates the man, forcing him to admit that he took the doll from the torched toy store.\n\nKaren unsuccessfully tries to convince Mike that the doll is alive, but he insists that he killed Ray. After bringing Karen home, Norris is attacked by Chucky, and in the ensuing fight, he shoots the doll, whose wound inexplicably bleeds and causes pain. Chucky escapes to his former voodoo instructor John, who informs him that the longer his soul remains in the doll, the more \"human\" the doll will become. Chucky demands that John help him reverse the spell, but he refuses. Chucky tortures John with a [[voodoo doll]], forcing him to reveal that in order to escape the doll's body, Chucky must transfer his soul to the first human he revealed his true identity to: Andy. Chucky stabs the voodoo doll in the chest, mortally wounding John, and escapes. Karen and Norris arrive shortly after. Before dying, John tells them that to kill Chucky, they must strike at his heart.\n\nChucky arrives at the psychiatric hospital where Andy is being held and kills a doctor with an [[Electroconvulsive therapy|electroshock therapy]] device. In the chaos, Andy escapes and flees home, but Chucky follows closely behind and knocks him out. As Chucky prepares to possess him with the voodoo chant, Karen and Norris arrive. Karen and Andy manage to trap Chucky in the fireplace and light him on fire, but a charred Chucky rises and chases Andy. Karen shoots Chucky repeatedly, blowing him to pieces. Norris' partner Jack arrives at the apartment, initially refusing to believe the three's story about the doll being alive. Chucky's body suddenly bursts through a vent to strangle Jack. Karen manages to tear Chucky off of Jack and Norris shoots Chucky's body through the heart, finally killing him. Jack, Norris, Karen, and Andy then leave the room, with Andy turning back to look at Chucky's remains.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Catherine Hicks]] as Karen Barclay\n* [[Chris Sarandon]] as Detective Mike Norris\n* [[Alex Vincent (actor)|Alex Vincent]] as [[Andy Barclay]]\n* [[Dinah Manoff]] as Maggie Peterson\n* [[Tommy Swerdlow]] as Jack Santos\n* [[Jack Colvin]] as Dr. Ardmore\n* Raymond Oliver as John \"Dr. Death\" Bishop\n* [[Neil Giuntoli]] as Eddie Caputo\n* [[Brad Dourif]] as [[Chucky (character)|Charles Lee Ray/Chucky]]\n** [[Edan Gross]] as Friendly Chucky (voice)\n** [[John Franklin (actor)|John Franklin]] as Walkabout Chucky\n** [[Ed Gale]] as Chucky (in-suit performer)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ihorror.com/know-chucky-played-real-person-exclusive-interview-ed-gale/|title=Chucky Was Played by a Real Person Exclusive Interview with Ed Gale|date=January 29, 2015|website=iHorror &#124; Horror News and Movie Reviews}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://bloody-disgusting.com/editorials/3554839/came-80s-hidey-ho-chucky-childs-play/|title=[It Came From the '80s] How Actors and Effects Made a Killer Doll a Horror Icon in 'Child's Play'|first=Meagan|last=Navarro|date=April 15, 2019}}</ref>\n\nAdditionally, [[Alan Wilder (actor)|Alan Wilder]] appears as Walter Criswell, [[Edan Gross]] as a young boy in a commercial promoting ''Good Guy'' dolls / Oscar Doll, Aaron Osborne as an orderly, Juan Ramirez as the homeless man who Karen received Chucky from, Tyler Hard as Mona, Ted Liss as George, Roslyn Alexander as Lucy\n\n===Chucky puppeteers===\n* Howard Berger<ref name=DVD>{{cite video|people=Tom Holland (Director)|title=Child's Play|medium=DVD|location=United States|publisher=United Artists|date=1988}}</ref>\n* Bill Bryan<ref name=DVD/>\n* Allen Coulter<ref name=DVD/>\n* Steven James<ref name=DVD/>\n* Frank Charles Lutkus III<ref name=DVD/>\n* David Arthur Nelson<ref name=DVD/>\n* Loren Soman<ref name=DVD/>\n* Marc Tyler<ref name=DVD/>\n* [[Brock Winkless|N.

[[Kevin Yagher]] was in charge of the puppetry for the film.<ref name=\":0\" /> Various animatronics and cosmetics were used for every scene. Throughout the film, Chucky transitions from appearing as a normal toy to appearing more human, with his [[Hair loss|hairline receding]] throughout the film.<ref name=\":0\" /> The film created multiple Chucky animatronics such as a flailing tantrum Chucky, a walking Chucky, and a stationary Chucky. The animatronic doll's face was controlled via remote control through a rig capturing facial movement on puppeteer [[Brock Winkless]].

Kirschner and Mancini subsequently cut 25 minutes of the film to reduce the amount of time Chucky was on screen, something Kirschner had advocated for during production to build suspense in a similar fashion to ''[[Jaws (film)|Jaws]]'' or ''[[Alien (film)|Alien]]''. Holland, who had repeatedly clashed with Kirschner over Chucky's amount of time on screen and the film's tone during shooting, objected to the cuts and left the production.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=survived/>\n\nThe three have also suggested that the test screening flopped due to their use of Walter as the doll's voice.<ref name=survived /><ref name=\":0\" /> They claimed that while Walter's voice was suitably menacing, she was unable to convey the humor intended for the character, and all of her lines were redubbed with Dourif's voice.<ref name=\":0\" /> The cut footage, shown only in [[Film still|production stills]] and the film's script, would have featured Charles Lee Ray stalking a drunk woman as a human only to discover it to be Mike Norris on an [[Undercover operation|undercover]] [[sting operation]], Andy showing Chucky around his room and finding a photograph of his deceased father, John healing an infant through a Voodoo ritual, and Chucky unsuccessfully trying to break into Andy's room at the mental hospital and tricking a mentally-ill girl named Mona into carrying him into the ward.\n\nThe script also featured an alternate ending in which Chucky is stabbed by Andy with a knife mounted on a [[radio-controlled car]] and has his face and legs melted with a [[Water gun|squirt gun]] filled with [[Drano]] in addition to being lit on fire and shot repeatedly by Mike and Karen. Chucky would have been seemingly killed by being overpowered by Jack and several police officers. While storing Chucky's remains in an evidence room, another cop would have disbelieved Jack's assertion that the doll was alive, and after they left, Chucky's disembodied arm would have come to life to swat a fly.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/ChildsPlay1988_201610/Child%27s%20Play%20(1988)_djvu.txt|title=Full text of \"Child's Play (1988) Script\"|website=archive.org|access-date=2019-02-18}}</ref>\n\n=== Music ===\nThe score was composed by Joseph Renzetti which featured a collection of electronic and orchestral elements.

Local news reporters from two TV stations were broadcasting live from the scene. The producer, [[David Kirschner]], was watching the demonstration on TV and was disturbed. Jeffrey Hilton, who had been working in Kirschner's office at MGM, indicated that he could quell the disturbance in ten minutes. While Kirschner was watching from the safety of his office, Hilton spoke to the group's leader and shook his hand. The group instantly dispersed, much to the chagrin of the newscasters. Hilton did not reveal to Kirschner whether it had been a threat or simple diplomacy that saved the day.\n\nHilton's diplomacy notwithstanding, the film series was plagued with accusations of inciting violence in children. ''[[Child's Play 3]]'' was cited as the \"inspiration\" for two murders, which took place in the [[United Kingdom]] in December 1992 and February 1993 respectively: the [[murder of Suzanne Capper]] and the [[murder of James Bulger]]. In the Suzanne Capper case, the 16-year-old was forced to listen to recordings of the gangleader repeating the catchphrase \"I'm Chucky, wanna play?\"<ref>January 28, 1996 [http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4161/is_19960128/ai_n9700544/ Sex with 'Chucky' killer] ''[[Sunday Mirror]]''</ref><ref>18 December 1993 [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/horror-fiction-became-reality-1468190.html Horror fiction became reality] ''[[The Independent]]''</ref><ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=mMnGvglaNbcC&pg=PA207&lpg=PA207&dq=gang+manchester+tortured+girl+fire+chucky+wanna+play Computers, curriculum, and cultural change: an introduction for teachers] By Eug\u00e8ne F.
