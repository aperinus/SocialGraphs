Based on the [[DC Comics]] superhero, [[Batman]], it is the sequel to ''[[Batman Begins]]'' (2005) and the second installment in ''[[The Dark Knight Trilogy]]''. The plot follows the vigilante [[Bruce Wayne (Dark Knight trilogy)|Batman]], police lieutenant [[James Gordon (comics)|James Gordon]], and district attorney [[Two-Face|Harvey Dent]], who form an alliance to dismantle [[organized crime]] in [[Gotham City]]. Their efforts are derailed by the [[Joker (The Dark Knight)|Joker]], an anarchistic mastermind who seeks to test how far Batman will go to save the city from chaos. The [[ensemble cast]] includes [[Christian Bale]], [[Michael Caine]], [[Heath Ledger]], [[Gary Oldman]], [[Aaron Eckhart]], [[Maggie Gyllenhaal]], and [[Morgan Freeman]].\n\n[[Warner Bros. Pictures]] prioritized a sequel following the successful reinvention of the [[Batman in film|''Batman'' film series]] with ''Batman Begins''. Christopher and ''Batman Begins'' co-writer [[David S. Goyer]] developed the story elements, making Dent the central protagonist and [[tragic hero]] caught up in the battle between Batman and the Joker. In writing the screenplay, the Nolans were influenced by 1980s ''Batman'' comics and crime drama films, and sought to continue ''Batman Begins''{{'}} heightened reality tone. From April to November 2007, filming took place with a $185{{nbsp}}million budget in Chicago and Hong Kong, and on sets in England. ''The Dark Knight'' was the first major motion picture to be filmed with high-resolution [[IMAX]] cameras. Christopher avoided using [[computer-generated imagery]] unless necessary, insisting on practical stunts such as flipping an [[Semi-trailer truck|18-wheel truck]] and blowing up a factory.\n\n''The Dark Knight'' was marketed with an innovative interactive [[viral marketing|viral campaign]] that initially focused on countering criticism of Ledger's casting by those who believed he was a poor choice to portray the Joker. Ledger died from an accidental drug overdose in January 2008, leading to widespread interest from the press and public regarding his performance. When it was released in July, ''The Dark Knight'' broke several box-office records and became the [[2008 in film|highest-grossing 2008 film]], the [[List of highest-grossing films|fourth-highest-grossing film of its time]], and the highest-grossing superhero film. It received acclaim for its mature tone and themes, visual style, and performances\u2014particularly that of Ledger, who received several posthumous awards including the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor]], making ''The Dark Knight'' the first comic-book film to receive a major Academy Award.\n\nSince its release, ''The Dark Knight'' has been assessed as one of the greatest superhero films ever made, one of the best films of the 2000s, and one of the [[best films ever made]]. It is considered the \"blueprint\" for modern superhero films, particularly for its rejection of a comic-book style in favor of a genre film that features comic-book characters. Many filmmakers sought to repeat its success by emulating its gritty, realistic tone to varying degrees of success. ''The Dark Knight'' has been analyzed for its themes of terrorism and the limitations of morality and ethics. The United States [[Library of Congress]] selected it for preservation in the [[National Film Registry]] in 2020. A sequel, ''[[The Dark Knight Rises]]'', concluded ''The Dark Knight Trilogy'' in 2012.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- WP:FILMPLOT mandates that plot summaries for feature films be between 400 and 700 words. PLEASE DO NOT ADD MORE DETAIL TO THIS SUMMARY. -->\n\nA gang of masked criminals robs a [[American Mafia|mafia]]-owned bank in [[Gotham City]], each betraying the others until the sole survivor, the [[Joker (The Dark Knight)|Joker]], reveals himself as the mastermind and escapes with the money. The vigilante [[Bruce Wayne (Dark Knight trilogy)|Batman]], district attorney [[Harvey Dent]], and police lieutenant [[Jim Gordon (character)|Jim Gordon]] form an alliance to eliminate Gotham's organized crime. Batman's alter-ego, the billionaire Bruce Wayne, publicly supports Dent as Gotham's legitimate protector, believing his success will allow Batman to retire so Wayne can romantically pursue his childhood friend [[Rachel Dawes]], despite her relationship with Dent.\n\nThe mafia bosses gather to discuss protecting their organizations from the police, Batman, and the Joker. The Joker interrupts the meeting and offers to kill Batman for half of the fortune their accountant, Lau, concealed before fleeing to Hong Kong to avoid extradition. With the help of [[Wayne Enterprises]] CEO [[Lucius Fox]], Batman finds Lau in Hong Kong and returns him to the custody of Gotham police, and his testimony enables Dent to apprehend the crime families. The bosses accept the Joker's offer and he kills high-profile targets involved in the trial, including the judge and police commissioner; Gordon sacrifices himself to save the mayor. The Joker threatens his attacks will continue until Batman unmasks. The Joker targets Dent at a fundraising dinner and throws Rachel out of a window, but Batman rescues her.\n\nWayne struggles to understand the Joker's motives, but his butler [[Alfred Pennyworth]] says some simply relish destruction. Dent claims he is Batman to lure out the Joker, who attacks the police convoy transporting him. Batman and Gordon, who faked his death, apprehend the Joker, and Gordon is promoted to commissioner. At the police station, Batman interrogates the Joker, who says he finds Batman entertaining and has no intention of killing him. Having deduced Batman's feelings for Rachel, the Joker reveals she and Dent are being separately held in buildings that are rigged to explode. Batman races to save Rachel while Gordon goes after Dent, but they discover the Joker has switched their positions. Rachel is killed in the explosion, while Dent's face is severely burned on one side. The Joker escapes custody, extracts the fortune's location from Lau, and burns all of it.\n\nWayne Enterprises accountant Coleman Reese deduces Batman's identity and attempts to expose it, but the Joker threatens to blow up a hospital unless Reese is killed. While the police evacuate hospitals and Gordon struggles to keep Reese alive, the Joker meets with a disillusioned Dent, persuading him to take justice into his own hands and avenge Rachel. Dent defers his decision-making to his half-scarred, two-headed coin, killing the corrupt officers and mafiosi who contributed to Rachel's death. As panic grips the city, the Joker reveals two evacuation ferries, one carrying civilians and the other prisoners, are rigged to explode at midnight unless one group sacrifices the other. To the Joker's disbelief, the passengers refuse to kill one another. Batman subdues the Joker but refuses to kill him. Before the police arrest the Joker, he says although Batman proved incorruptible, his plan to corrupt Dent has succeeded.\n\nDent takes Gordon's family hostage, blaming his negligence for Rachel's death. He flips his coin to decide their fates but Batman tackles him to save Gordon's son, and Dent falls to his death. Believing Dent is the hero the city needs, Batman takes the blame for his death and actions, and persuades Gordon to conceal the truth. Pennyworth burns an undelivered message to Wayne from Rachel, who said she chose Dent, and Fox destroys the invasive surveillance network that helped Batman find the Joker. The city mourns Dent as a hero and the police launch a manhunt for Batman.\n\n==Cast==\n{{multiple image\n| total_width = 500\n| direction = horizontal\n| align = right\n| footer = (Left to right) [[Christian Bale]] (pictured in 2019), [[Gary Oldman]] (2014), and [[Aaron Eckhart]] (2016)\n| image1 = Christian Bale-7837.jpg\n| alt1 = A photograph of Christian Bale\n| image2 = Gary Oldman (13925515511) (cropped).jpg\n| alt2 = A photograph of Gary Oldman\n| image3 = Aaron Eckhart (29830286295) (cropped).jpg\n| alt3 = A photograph of Aaron Eckhart\n}}\n* [[Christian Bale]] as Bruce Wayne / Batman: A wealthy socialite who as a child was traumatized by his parents' murder.

Critic Siddhant Adlakha considered the Joker an analog for countries such as Iraq, Somalia, and Lebanon, which were targeted by U.S. military campaigns and responded with escalation using terrorism.<ref name=\"ThemesIGN\"/> Batman also inspires copycat vigilantes, further escalating lawlessness. Film studies professor Todd McGowan said Batman asserts authority over these copycats, telling them to stop because they do not have the same defensive equipment as himself, reaffirming his self-given authority to act as a vigilante.<ref name=\"ThemesJumpCut\"/>\n\nThe film has been analyzed as an analog for the war on terror, the militaristic campaign the U.S. launched following the [[September 11 attacks]] in 2001.<ref name=\"ThemesIGN\"/> The scene in which Batman stands in the ruins of a destroyed building, having failed to prevent the Joker's plot, is reminiscent of the [[World Trade Center site]] after September 11.<ref name=\"ThemesIGN\"/>  According to historian [[Stephen Prince]], ''The Dark Knight'' is about the consequences of civil and government authorities abandoning rules in the fight against terrorism.{{sfn|Fradley|2013|p=17}} Several publications criticized ''The Dark Knight'' for a perceived endorsement of \"necessary evils\" such as torture and [[Rendition (law)|rendition]].{{sfn|Fradley|2013|pp=17\u201318}} Author [[Andrew Klavan]] said Batman is a stand-in for then-U.S. president [[George W. Bush]] and justified the breaching of \"boundaries of civil rights to deal with an emergency, certain that [Batman] will re-establish those boundaries when the emergency is past\".<ref name=\"ThemesJumpCut\"/><ref name=\"ThemesKlavan\"/> Klavan's interpretation was criticized by some publications that considered ''The Dark Knight'' anti-war, proposing society must not abandon the rule of law to combat lawlessness or risk creating the conditions for escalation.<ref name=\"ThemesNYTimes\"/><ref name=\"ThemeNewRepublic\"/> This is exemplified in the covert alliance formed between Batman, Dent, and Gordon, leading to Rachel's death and Dent's corruption.{{sfn|Fradley|2013|pp=17\u201318}} Writer Benjamin Kerstein said both viewpoints are valid, and that \"''The Dark Knight'' is a perfect mirror of the society which is watching it: a society so divided on the issues of terror and how to fight it that, for the first time in decades, an American mainstream no longer exists\".<ref name=\"ThemesKerstein\"/>\n\nBatman and Dent resort to torture or [[enhanced interrogation]] to stop the Joker but he remains immune to Batman's physical abuse because he has a strong belief in his goals. When Dent ineffectually attempts to torture Joker's henchman, Batman does not condemn the act, only being concerned about public perception if people discover the truth. This conveys the protagonists' gradual abandonment of their principles when faced with an extreme foe.<ref name=\"ThemesIGN\"/> The Joker meets Dent in a hospital to explain how expected atrocities, such as the deaths of several soldiers, and societal failings are tolerated but when norms are unexpectedly disrupted, people panic and descend into chaos.<ref name=\"ThemesIGN\"/><ref name=\"ThemeSlashFilm\"/> Although the Joker wears disguising makeup, he is not hiding behind a mask and is the same person with or without makeup. He lacks any identity or origin, representing the uncertainty, unknowability, and fear of terrorism, although he does not follow any political ideology.<ref name=\"ThemesIGN\"/><ref name=\"NYtimesArtofDarkness\"/> Dent represents the fulfillment of American idealism, a noble person who can work within the confines of the law and allow Batman to retire, but the fear and chaos embodied by the Joker taints that idealism and corrupts Dent absolutely.<ref name=\"ThemesIGN\"/>\n\nIn ''The Dark Knight''{{'}}s final act, Batman employs an invasive surveillance network by co-opting the phones of Gotham's citizens to locate the Joker, violating their privacy. Adlakha described this act as a \"militaristic fantasy\", in which a significant violation of civil liberties is required through the means of advanced technology to capture a dangerous terrorist, reminiscent of the [[Patriot Act|2001 Patriot Act]]. Lucius Fox threatens to stop helping Batman in response, believing he has crossed an ethical boundary, and although Batman agrees these violations are unacceptable and destroys the technology, the film demonstrates he could not have stopped the Joker in time without it.<ref name=\"ThemesIGN\"/><ref name=\"ThemesJumpCut\"/>\n\n===Morality and ethics===\n''The Dark Knight'' focuses on the moral and ethical battles faced by the central characters, and the compromises they make to defeat the Joker under extraordinary circumstances.{{efn|Attributed to multiple references:<ref name=\"ReviewRogerEbert\"/><ref name=\"ThemesIGN\"/><ref name=\"ThemeSlashFilm\"/><ref name=\"InfluenceGuardian10thAnni\"/>}} Roger Ebert said the Joker forces impossible ethical decisions on each character to test the limits of their morality.<ref name=\"ReviewRogerEbert\"/><ref name=\"ThemesIGN\"/> Batman represents order to the Joker's chaos and is brought to his own limit but avoids completely compromising himself. Dent represents goodness and hope; he is the city's \"white knight\" who is \"pure\" of intent and can operate within the law.<ref name=\"ThemesIGN\"/><ref name=\"ThemesJumpCut\"/><ref name=\"ThemeSlashFilm\"/> Dent is motivated to do good because he identifies himself as good, not through trauma like Batman, and has faith in the legal system.<ref name=\"ThemesJumpCut\"/> Adlakha wrote Dent is framed as a religious icon, his campaign slogan being \"I believe in Harvey Dent\", and his eventual death leaves his arms spread wide like [[Crucifixion of Jesus|Jesus on the Cross]].<ref name=\"ThemesIGN\"/><ref name=\"ThemeSlashFilm\"/> Eckhart described Dent as someone who loves the law but feels constrained by it and his inability to do what he believes is right because the rules he must follow do not allow it.<ref name=\"ObserverCAEffects\"/> Dent's desire to work outside the law is seen in his support of Batman's vigilantism to accomplish what he cannot.{{sfn|Duncan Jesser|Pourroy|2012|p=48}}\n\nDent's corruption suggests he is a proxy for those looking for hope because he is as fallible and susceptible to darkness as anyone else.<ref name=\"ThemeSlashFilm\"/> This can be seen in his use of a two-headed coin to make decisions involving others, eliminating the risk of chance by controlling the outcome in his favor, indicating losing is not an acceptable outcome for him. Once Dent experiences a significant traumatic event in the loss of Rachel and his own disfigurement, he quickly abandons his noble former self to seek his own form of justice. His coin is scarred on one side, introducing the risk of chance, and he submits himself to it completely. According to English professor Daniel Boscaljon, Dent is not broken; he believes in a different form of justice in a seemingly unjust world, flipping a coin because it is \"Unbiased. Unprejudiced. Fair.\"{{sfn|Boscaljon|2013|p=60}}\n\nThe Joker represents an ideological deviancy; he does not seek personal gain and causes chaos for its own sake, setting a towering pile of cash ablaze to prove \"everything burns\". Unlike Batman, the Joker is the same with or without makeup, having no identity to conceal and nothing to lose.{{efn|Attributed to multiple references:<ref name=\"ThemesJumpCut\"/><ref name=\"ThemeSlashFilm\"/><ref name=\"InfluenceGuardian10thAnni\"/>{{sfn|Boscaljon|2013|p=55}}}} Boscaljon wrote the residents and criminals believe in a form of order and rules that must be obeyed; the Joker deliberately upends this belief because he has no rules or limitations.{{sfn|Boscaljon|2013|pp=51\u201352}} The character can be considered an example of [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]'s \"[[\u00dcbermensch|Superman]]\", who exists outside definitions such as good and evil, and follows his own indomitable will. The film, however, leaves open the option to dismiss his insights because his chaos ultimately leads to tragedy and injustice.{{sfn|Boscaljon|2013|p=53}} Christopher described the Joker as an unadulterated evil, and professor Charles Bellinger considered him a satanic figure who repels people from goodness and tempts them with things they supposedly lack, such as forcing Batman to choose between saving Dent\u2014who is best for the city\u2014and Rachel, who is best for Wayne.{{sfn|Boscaljon|2013|pp=52,55\u201356}} The Joker aims to corrupt Dent to prove anyone, even symbols, can be broken. In their desperation, Dent and Batman are forced to question their own limitations. As the Joker states to Batman:\n\n{{Blockquote\n| text      =Their morals, their code&nbsp;... it's a bad joke. Dropped at the first sign of trouble. They're only as good as the world allows them to be.

Building on ''Batman Begins''{{'}} heightened realism and presentation of a mature tone with contemporary themes and complex characters, ''The Dark Knight'' proved the genre could produce films with a distinct vision, artistic merit, and social commentary.{{efn|Attributed to multiple references:<ref name=\"Wapogreatness\"/><ref name=\"InfluenceABCNews\"/><ref name=\"InfluenceTHR\" /><ref name=\"InfluenceEW\"/>}} A 2018 retrospective by ''The Hollywood Reporter'' said ''The Dark Knight'' taught filmmakers \"comic book characters are malleable. They are able to be grounded or fantastic, able to be prestigious or pure blockbuster entertainment, to be dark and gritty or light, to be character-driven or action-packed, or any variation in-between.\"<ref name=\"InfluenceTHR\"/>\n\n''The Dark Knight'' is considered a blueprint for the modern superhero film that productions either attempt to closely emulate or deliberately counter.{{efn|Attributed to multiple references:<ref name=\"InfluenceABCNews\"/><ref name=\"InfluenceVarietyOscars\"/><ref name=\"InfluenceGuardian10thAnni\"/><ref name=\"InfluenceEsquire\"/>}} Its financial, critical, and cultural successes legitimized the genre with film studios at a time when recent films, such as ''[[Daredevil (film)|Daredevil]]'', ''[[Hulk (film)|Hulk]]'' (both 2003), ''[[Fantastic Four (2005 film)|Fantastic Four]]'' (2005), and ''[[Superman Returns]]'' (2006) had failed to meet expectations.<ref name=\"InfluenceTheAtlantic\"/><ref name=\"NYTimesComicbookfilms\"/> The genre became a focus of annual studio strategies rather than a relatively niche project, and a surge of comic-book adaptations followed, in part because of their broad franchising potential. In 2008, Ebert wrote; \"[''The Dark Knight''], and to a lesser degree ''Iron Man'', redefine the possibilities of the 'comic-book movie'\".<ref name=\"Wapogreatness\"/> ''[[The Atlantic]]'' wrote ''Iron Man''{{'}}s legacy in launching the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU) could not have happened without ''The Dark Knight''{{'s}} success.<ref name=\"LATimesWatchmen\"/><ref name=\"InfluenceTheAtlantic\"/><ref name=\"InfluenceTHR\"/>\n\nRetrospective analysis has focused on the way studios, eager to replicate its performance, released tonally dark, gritty, and realistic films, or reboots of existing franchises, many of which failed critically or commercially.<ref name=\"InfluenceVarietyOscars\"/><ref name=\"InfluenceTHR\"/><ref name=\"InfluenceScreenRantWrongLessons\"/> Some publications said studios took the wrong lessons from ''The Dark Knight'', treating source material too seriously and mistaking a dark, gritty tone for narrative depth and intelligent writing.{{efn|Attributed to multiple references:<ref name=\"InfluenceGuardian10thAnni\"/><ref name=\"InfluenceScreenRantWrongLessons\"/><ref name=\"InfluenceEsquire\"/><ref name=\"LATimesWrongLessons\"/>}} The MCU is seen as a successful continuation of what made ''The Dark Knight'' a success, combining genres and tones relevant to each respective film while treating the source material seriously, unlike the [[DC Extended Universe]], which more closely emulated the tone of ''The Dark Knight'' but failed to replicate its success.<ref name=\"InfluenceScreenRantWrongLessons\"/><ref name=\"DOGMarvelInfluence\"/>\n\nDirectors including [[Sam Mendes]] (''[[Skyfall]]''), [[Ryan Coogler]] (''Black Panther''), and [[David Ayer]] (''[[Suicide Squad (film)|Suicide Squad]]''), and the creators of the television show ''[[Arrow]]'', have cited ''The Dark Knight'' as an influence.{{efn|Attributed to multiple references:<ref name=\"InfluenceEsquire\"/><ref name=\"InfluenceCollider\"/><ref name=\"InfluenceScreenRant\"/><ref name=\"InfluenceFSR\"/>}} The film has been referenced in a variety of media including television shows such as ''[[Robot Chicken]]'', ''[[South Park]]'', and ''[[The Simpsons]]''.<ref name=\"ReferencedinSimpsons\"/><ref name=\"ReferencedinSouthPark\"/><ref name=\"ReferencedinRobot\"/> U.S. President [[Barack Obama]] used Joker to explain the growth of [[Islamic State]] (IS) military group, saying \"{{nbsp}}... the gang leaders of Gotham are meeting{{nbsp}}... they were thugs, but there was a kind of order{{nbsp}}... the Joker comes in and lights the whole city on fire.
