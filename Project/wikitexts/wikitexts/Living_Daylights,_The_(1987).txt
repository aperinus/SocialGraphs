Directed by [[John Glen (director)|John Glen]], the film's title is taken from [[Ian Fleming]]'s short story \"[[Octopussy and The Living Daylights|The Living Daylights]]\", the plot of which also forms the basis of the first act of the film. It was the last film to use the title of an Ian Fleming story until the 2006 instal<!-- Please do not add another L: British English spells \"instalment\" with one L and this article carries a BrEng tag -->ment ''[[Casino Royale (2006 film)|Casino Royale]]''. The film was produced by [[Albert R. Broccoli]], his stepson [[Michael G. Wilson]], and co-produced by his daughter, [[Barbara Broccoli]]. ''The Living Daylights'' grossed $191.2 million worldwide, and received mixed reviews from critics.\n\n==Plot==\n[[James Bond]] is assigned to help [[KGB]] General Georgi Koskov defect, covering his escape from a concert hall in [[Bratislava]], [[Czechoslovakia]]. During the mission, Bond notices that a KGB sniper is a female cellist from the orchestra. Disobeying his orders to kill the sniper, he shoots the rifle from her hands, then uses the [[Trans-Siberian Pipeline]] to smuggle Koskov across the border to the West.\n\nIn his post-defection debriefing, Koskov informs [[Secret Intelligence Service|MI6]] that the KGB's old policy of \"[[SMERSH#Name|Smiert Spionam]]\", meaning \"Death to Spies\", has been revived by General Leonid Pushkin, the new head of the KGB. Koskov is later abducted from the safe-house and assumed to have been taken back to [[Moscow]]. Bond is directed to track down Pushkin in [[Tangier]] and kill him, to forestall further killings of agents and escalation of tensions between the Soviet Union and the West. Bond agrees to carry out the mission when he learns that the assassin who killed 004 in [[Gibraltar]] (as depicted in the pre-title sequence) left a note bearing the same message, \"Smiert Spionam\".\n\nBond returns to Bratislava to track down the cellist, Kara Milovy. He finds out that Koskov's entire defection was staged, and that Kara is actually Koskov's girlfriend. Bond convinces Kara that he is a friend of Koskov's and persuades her to accompany him to [[Vienna]], supposedly to be reunited with him. They escape Bratislava while being pursued by the KGB, crossing over the border into [[Austria]]. Meanwhile, Pushkin meets with an arms dealer, Brad Whitaker, in Tangier, informing him that the KGB is cancelling an arms deal previously arranged between Koskov and Whitaker.\n\n[[File:Cello Case Sled (The Living Daylights) National Motor Museum, Beaulieu.jpg|thumb|left|Cello Case Sled in the [[National Motor Museum, Beaulieu]]]]\nDuring his brief tryst with Milovy in Vienna, Bond visits the [[Prater]] to meet his MI6 ally, Saunders, who discovers a history of financial dealings between Koskov and Whitaker. As he leaves their meeting, Saunders is killed by Koskov's henchman Necros, who again leaves the message \"Smiert Spionam\". Bond and Kara promptly leave for Tangier, where Bond confronts Pushkin, who disavows any knowledge of \"Smiert Spionam\" and reveals that Koskov is evading arrest for [[embezzlement]] of government funds. Bond and Pushkin then join forces, and Bond fakes Pushkin's assassination, inducing Whitaker and Koskov to progress with their scheme. Meanwhile, Kara contacts Koskov, who tells her that Bond is actually a KGB agent, and convinces her to drug him so that he can be captured.\n\nKoskov, Necros, Kara, and the captive Bond fly to a Soviet air base in [[Democratic Republic of Afghanistan|Afghanistan]], where Koskov betrays Kara and imprisons her, along with Bond. The pair escape, and in doing so, free a condemned prisoner, Kamran Shah, leader of the local [[Mujahideen]]. Bond and Milovy discover that Koskov is using Soviet funds to buy a massive shipment of [[opium]] from the Mujahideen, intending to keep the profits with enough left over to supply the Soviets with their arms and buy Western arms from Whitaker.\n\nWith the Mujahideen's help, Bond plants a bomb aboard the cargo plane carrying the opium, but is spotted and has no choice but to barricade himself in the plane. Meanwhile, the Mujahideen attack the air base on horseback and engage the Soviets in a gun battle. During the battle, Kara drives a jeep into the cargo hold of the plane as Bond takes off, and Necros also leaps aboard at the last second from a jeep driven by Koskov. After a struggle, Bond throws Necros to his death and deactivates the bomb. Bond then notices Shah and his men being pursued by Soviet forces. He re-activates the bomb and drops it out of the plane and onto a bridge, blowing it up and helping Shah and his men escape the Soviets. The plane subsequently crashes, destroying the drugs, while Bond and Kara escape.\n\nBond returns to Tangier to kill Whitaker, infiltrating his estate with the help of his ally [[Felix Leiter]], and Pushkin arrests Koskov, ordering him to be sent back to Moscow \"in the diplomatic bag\".\n\nSome time later, Kara is the solo cellist in a Vienna performance. Kamran Shah and his men jostle in during the intermission and are introduced to now-diplomat General Gogol (Pushkin's predecessor at the KGB), and the Soviets. After her performance, Bond surprises Kara in her dressing room, and they embrace.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Timothy Dalton]] as [[James Bond filmography|James Bond 007]], an MI6 agent assigned to look into the deaths of several [[KGB]] defectors and conspiracies against several of his allies.\n<!-- opening title cards -->\n* [[Maryam d'Abo]] as Kara Milovy, Koskov's girlfriend and later Bond's love interest.\n* [[Joe Don Baker]] as [[Brad Whitaker]], an American arms dealer and self-styled general, who serves as Koskov's primary ally.

Following Bond's use of the [[Aston Martin DBS]] in ''[[On Her Majesty's Secret Service (film)|On Her Majesty's Secret Service]]'', the filmmakers then turned to the brand new [[Lotus Esprit]] in 1977's ''[[The Spy Who Loved Me (film)|The Spy Who Loved Me]]'', which reappeared four years later in ''[[For Your Eyes Only (film)|For Your Eyes Only]]''. Aston Martin then returned with their [[Aston Martin V8 Vantage (1977)|V8 Vantage]].\n\nTwo different Aston Martin models were used in filming\u2014a V8 Volante convertible, and later for the [[Czechoslovakia]] scenes, a hard-top [[Aston Martin V8|non-Volante V8 saloon]] badged to look like the Volante.  The Volante was a production model owned by then Aston Martin Lagonda chairman, [[Victor Gauntlett]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://astonmartins.com/car/007-v8-from-the-living-daylights/|title=007 V8 Vantage/Volante|publisher=Astonmartins.com|access-date=18 December 2014|archive-date=18 September 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130918123552/http://astonmartins.com/car/007-v8-from-the-living-daylights/|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Music===\n{{Main|The Living Daylights (soundtrack)}}\n''The Living Daylights'' was the final Bond film to be scored by composer [[John Barry (composer)|John Barry]]. The soundtrack is notable for its introduction of sequenced electronic rhythm tracks overdubbed with the orchestra\u2014at the time, a relatively new innovation.\n\nThe title song of the film, \"[[The Living Daylights (song)|The Living Daylights]]\", was co-written with [[Paul Waaktaar-Savoy|P\u00e5l Waaktaar]] of the Norwegian pop-music group [[A-ha]] and recorded by the band. The group and Barry did not collaborate well, resulting in two versions of the theme song.<ref name=\"UKC4TV\">{{cite video |year=2006 | title =James Bond's Greatest Hits | medium =Television | location =UK | publisher =North One Television}}</ref> Barry's film mix is heard on the soundtrack (and on A-ha's later compilation album ''Headlines and Deadlines''). The version preferred by the band can be heard on the A-ha album ''[[Stay on These Roads]]'', released in 1988. However, in 2006, Waaktaar complimented Barry's contributions: \"I loved the stuff he added to the track, I mean it gave it this really cool string arrangement. That's when for me it started to sound like a Bond thing\".<ref name=\"UKC4TV\"/> The title song is one of the few 007 title songs not performed or written by a British or American performer.\n\nIn a departure from previous Bond films, ''The Living Daylights'' was the first to use different songs over the opening and end credits. The song heard over the end credits, \"If There Was A Man\" (which also acts as the \"love theme\" of the film), was one of two songs performed for the film by [[Chrissie Hynde]] of [[The Pretenders]]. The other song, \"[[Where Has Everybody Gone?]]\", is heard from Necros's [[Walkman]] in the film - the melody of the song is subsequently used in the score to announce Necros whenever he attacks. The Pretenders were originally considered to perform the title song. However, the producers had been pleased with the commercial success of [[Duran Duran]]'s \"A View to a Kill\", and felt that A-ha would be more likely to make an impact on the charts.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.thegoldengun.co.uk/tld/tldsound.html | title=The Living Daylights | publisher=Fastrac Publications | access-date=11 October 2007 | url-status=dead | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071023133932/http://www.thegoldengun.co.uk/tld/tldsound.html | archive-date=23 October 2007}}</ref>\n\nThe original soundtrack was released on LP and CD by Warner Bros. and featured only 12 tracks. Later re-releases by [[Rykodisc]] and [[EMI]] added nine additional tracks, including alternate instrumental end credits music. Rykodisc's version included the [[gun barrel sequence|gun barrel]] and opening sequence of the film as well as the jailbreak sequence, and the bombing of the bridge.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.soundtrack.net/albums/database/?id=1429 | title=The Living Daylights | work=SoundtrackNet | access-date=7 October 2007 | archive-date=15 October 2007 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071015125918/http://www.soundtrack.net/albums/database/?id=1429 | url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nAdditionally, the film featured a number of pieces of classical music, as the main [[Bond girl]], Kara Milovy, is a cellist.
