While embarking on his journey, Hutter stops at an inn where the locals become frightened by the mere mention of Orlok's name.\n\nHutter rides on a coach to a castle, where he is welcomed by Count Orlok. When Hutter is eating dinner and accidentally cuts his thumb, Orlok tries to suck the blood out, but his repulsed guest pulls his hand away. Hutter wakes up the morning after to find fresh punctures on his neck, which he attributes to mosquitoes. That night, Orlok signs the documents to purchase the house and notices a photo of Hutter's wife, Ellen, remarking that she has a \"lovely neck.\" Reading a book about vampires that he took from the local inn, Hutter starts to suspect that Orlok is a vampire. He cowers in his room as midnight approaches, with no way to bar the door. The door opens by itself and Orlok enters, and Hutter hides under the bed covers and falls unconscious. Meanwhile, his wife awakens from her sleep, and in a trance walks onto her balcony's railing, which gets his friend Harding's attention. When the doctor arrives, she shouts Hutter's name, apparently able to see Orlok in his castle threatening her unconscious husband.\n\nThe next day, Hutter explores the castle, only to retreat back into his room after he finds the coffin in which Orlok is resting dormant in the crypt. Hours later, Orlok piles up coffins on a coach and climbs into the last one before the coach departs, and Hutter rushes home after learning this. The coffins are taken aboard a schooner, where all of the ship's sailors and captain die and Orlok takes control. When the ship arrives in Wisborg, Orlok leaves unobserved, carrying one of his coffins, and moves into the house he purchased.\n\nMany deaths in the town follow after Orlok's arrival, which the town's doctors blame on an unspecified plague. Ellen reads the book Hutter found, which claims that a vampire can be defeated if a pure-hearted woman distracts the vampire with her beauty. She opens her window to invite Orlok in, but faints. Hutter revives her, and she sends him to fetch Professor Bulwer, a physician. After he leaves, Orlok enters and drinks her blood, but starts as the sun rises, causing Orlok to vanish in a puff of smoke by the sunlight. Ellen lives just long enough to be embraced by her grief-stricken husband.\n\nThe last scene shows Count Orlok's destroyed castle in the [[Carpathian Mountains]], symbolizing the end of his bloody reign of terror.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Schreck.jpg|thumb|right|Schreck in a promotional still for the film]]\n* [[Max Schreck]] as [[Count Orlok]]\n* [[Gustav von Wangenheim]] as Thomas Hutter\n* [[Greta Schr\u00f6der]] as Ellen Hutter\n* [[Alexander Granach]] as Knock\n* [[Georg H.

Galeen was an experienced specialist in [[dark romanticism]]; he had already worked on ''[[The Student of Prague (1913 film)|The Student of Prague]]'' (1913), and the screenplay for ''[[The Golem: How He Came into the World]]'' (1920). Galeen set the story in the fictional north German harbour town of Wisborg. He changed the characters' names and added the idea of the vampire bringing the plague to Wisborg via rats on the ship, and left out the [[Abraham Van Helsing|Van Helsing]] vampire hunter character. Galeen's [[German Expressionism (cinema)|Expressionist style]] screenplay was poetically rhythmic, without being so dismembered as other books influenced by [[Expressionism in literature|literary Expressionism]], such as those by [[Carl Mayer]].

A [[take]] from Marienkirche's tower over Wismar marketplace with the Wasserkunst Wismar served as the [[establishing shot]] for the Wisborg scene. Other locations were the Wassertor, the Heiligen-Geist-Kirche yard and the harbour. In [[L\u00fcbeck]], the abandoned [[Salzspeicher]] served as Nosferatu's new Wisborg house, the one of the churchyard of the [[Aegidienkirche (L\u00fcbeck)|Aegidienkirche]] served as Hutter's, and down the Depenau a procession of coffin bearers bore [[coffin]]s of supposed plague victims.
