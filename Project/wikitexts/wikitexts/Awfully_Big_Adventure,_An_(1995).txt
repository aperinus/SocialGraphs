The story concerns a teenage girl who joins a local repertory theatre troupe in [[Liverpool]]. During a winter production of ''[[Peter and Wendy|Peter Pan]]'', the play quickly turns into a dark metaphor for youth as she becomes drawn into a web of sexual politics and intrigue.\n\nThe title is an ironic nod to the original [[Peter Pan]] story, in which Peter says, \"To die will be an awfully big adventure.\" Set in 1947, the film was adapted from the [[Booker Prize]]-nominated 1989 [[An Awfully Big Adventure (novel)|novel of the same name]] by [[Beryl Bainbridge]].\n\n==Plot==\n{{Long plot|date=July 2021}}\nIn the film's prologue, a hotelier ushers a child into a bomb shelter during the [[Liverpool Blitz]].  We see a brief flashback to a woman leaving her baby in a basement surrounded by flickering candles. Before departing from the house, she quickly drops a string of pearls on the child's pillow, twined around a single rose.\n\nYears later, 16-year-old Stella Bradshaw lives in a working class household with her Uncle Vernon and Aunt Lily in [[Liverpool]]. Lacking an adult in her life to whom she feels close, she frequently goes into phone booths to \"speak with her mother\", who never appears in the film.  Her uncle, who sees a theatrical career as being her only alternative to working behind the counter at [[F. W. Woolworth Company|Woolworth's]], signs her up for speech lessons and pulls strings to get her involved at a local repertory theatre. After an unsuccessful audition, Stella gets a job gofering for Meredith Potter, the troupe's sleazy, eccentric director, and Bunny, his faithful stage manager.\n\nThe impressionable Stella develops a crush on the worldly, self-absorbed Meredith, whose [[homosexuality]] completely eludes her.  Amused, he gives her the small role of [[Ptolemy XIII Theos Philopator|Ptolemy the boy-king]] in ''[[Caesar and Cleopatra (play)|Caesar and Cleopatra]]'' but ignores her otherwise.  Meredith reveals himself to be an amoral, apathetic man who treats Stella and everyone else around him with scorn and condescension.  He reserves his greatest cruelty for Dawn Allenby, a desperate older actress whom he callously dismisses from the company; she later attempts suicide.\n\nMeredith also has a long history of preying upon young men. Stella is quickly caught up in the backstage intrigue and also becomes an object of sexual advances from men in and around the theatre company, including P. L. O'Hara ([[Alan Rickman]]), a brilliant actor who has returned to the troupe in a stint playing [[Captain Hook]] for its Christmas production of ''[[Peter Pan (play)|Peter Pan]]''.  In keeping with theatrical tradition, O'Hara also doubles as Mr. Darling.\n\nO'Hara carries himself with grace and charisma, but privately is as troubled and disillusioned as the other members of the cast. Haunted by his wartime experiences and a lost love who he believes bore him a son, O'Hara embarks on an affair with Stella, to whom he feels an inexplicably deep emotional connection.  Stella, who is still determined to win over Meredith, remains emotionally detached, but takes advantage of O'Hara's affections, seeing an opportunity to gain sexual experience.\n\nThe last straw for Stella is during a cast outing when Geoffrey, a fellow teenage stagehand whom Potter has been sexually toying with, bursts out and hits him in the nose. The cast rushes to comfort Geoffrey, but Stella exclaims that he ought to be sacked. O'Hara explains to her that Meredith has spent his life harming people like Geoffrey and causing pain to people like Bunny who really love him: \"believe it or not, it doesn't much matter him or her, old or young to Meredith.  What he wants is hearts.\"\n\nConcerned, O'Hara visits her aunt and uncle, who disclose Stella's history.  He finds out that Stella's long-missing mother was his lost love, whom he then knew by the nickname Stella Maris, making Stella \u2060\u2014 whom he's been sleeping with \u2060\u2014 his child, a daughter rather than the son he had imagined.  Keeping his discovery to himself, O'Hara gets on his motorcycle and drives back out to the seaport. Distracted by his new findings, he slips on a wet gangplank, hits his head, and is pitched into the water.  Before he drowns, he sees the woman from earlier flashbacks, clutching the infant.  Stella is later seen hastening to the phone booth to confide her woes over the phone. The absent Stella Maris had years ago won a nationwide contest to be the voice of the speaking clock.  It is her recorded voice that provides the only response to her daughter's confidences.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Alan Rickman]] as P.L.

Upon rejection, she dyed her hair red, changed her name and reinvented herself as a teenage girl from Liverpool with no acting experience and applied again. The second time she got the role.  Alan Rickman was reportedly miffed when he found out her true age. According to Mike Newell, he \"treated her very tactfully, presuming that she was sexually inexperienced and could get upset by the scene.\"<ref>{{cite news |last=Riding|first=Alan|title=An Identity Change Just To Win a Film Role|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/08/12/movies/an-identity-change-just-to-win-a-film-role.html |newspaper=The New York Times|date=12 August 1995|accessdate=22 April 2011}}</ref>\n\nHugh Grant based his characterization of Meredith on [[Richard Digby Day]], a past director of his from [[Nottingham Playhouse]].<ref name=\"SAG-AFTRA Foundation\">{{cite video| url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3lUJt4KmJw&t=1340s| title=Conversations with Hugh Grant| author=SAG-AFTRA Foundation| via=YouTube| date=2016-08-19| access-date=2018-06-27}}</ref>\n\nPrincipal photography took place mostly in [[Dublin]]; the playhouse in the film was the [[Olympia Theatre, Dublin|Olympia Theatre]].\n\n==Soundtrack==\nA soundtrack album was released on 20 June 1995 by Silva Screen Records.

Lisa Schwartzenbaum of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' wrote that \"Rickman... is the most interesting thing going in this unwieldy muddle... There's a creepy allure to O'Hara, and it is his energy that moves the story along to its unsettling surprise ending.\"<ref>{{cite news|last=Schwartzenbaum|first=Lisa|title=An Awfully Big Adventure|url=http://www.ew.com/article/1995/08/04/awfully-big-adventure |newspaper=Entertainment Weekly |accessdate=22 April 2011|date=4 August 1995}}</ref> Edward Guthmann of the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' wrote, \"This isn't a sentimental slice of British eccentricity, or a gentle glance at amateur theatricals and the oddballs who inhabit them... Instead, it's a sour, unpleasant experience that gives us every reason not to become involved. Newell, who directed ''[[Four Weddings and a Funeral|Four Weddings]]'' with such a light touch and such fondness, leaves the impression here that he doesn't like his characters and doesn't mind if we don't, either.\"<ref>{{cite news|last=Guthmann|first=Edward|title=This Grant 'Adventure' An Awfully Chilly One|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/1995/07/21/DD64380.DTL|accessdate=22 April 2011|work=San Francisco Chronicle|date=16 October 2010}}</ref>\n\n[[Janet Maslin]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'', however, felt that it captured \"Mr. Grant as the clever, versatile character actor he was then becoming, rather than the international dreamboat he is today... [the film] isn't overly concerned with making its stars look good. Mr. Grant wears a monocle, has nicotine-stained fingers and appears in one scene looking dissolute and vomit-stained... As it turns out, a public relations blackout is only the least of this admirable film's problems. Its Liverpool accents are thickly impenetrable. And Ms. Bainbridge's book is elliptical to begin with, which guarantees that some of its fine points will be lost in translation. Mr. Newell directs his actors beautifully, but the screenplay by Charles Wood echoes Ms. Bainbridge in letting important information fly by obliquely. So listen closely. This is a dark, eccentric film that both requires and rewards keen attention.\"<ref>{{cite news|last=Maslin|first=Janet|title=A Look at Hugh Grant Before His Big Success |url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=990CE3DD1530F932A15754C0A963958260 |newspaper=The New York Times|accessdate=22 April 2011|date=21 July 1995}}</ref>\n\nSimilarly, Joel Pearce of [[DVD Verdict]] commented that \"''An Awfully Big Adventure'' is disappointing, but not because it's a bad movie... In fact, it's a good movie that's been the victim of extremely bad marketing... Hugh Grant is at his sleazy, sardonic best... Some elements of the film are too subtle, so it takes a while to figure out what's really going on.\"<ref>{{dead link|date=May 2017}}{{cite web|last=Pearce |first=Joel |title=An Awfully Big Adventure |url=http://www.dvdverdict.com/reviews/awfullybigadventure.php |publisher=DVD Verdict |accessdate=22 April 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110810054617/http://www.dvdverdict.com/reviews/awfullybigadventure.php |archivedate=10 August 2011 }}</ref>\n\nAlan Rickman later said that he felt the film suffered comparisons to ''Four Weddings and a Funeral''.<ref>{{cite news |last=Linehan|first=Hugh|title=Acting Against Expectations|url=http://www.alan-rickman.com/articles/expectations.html|newspaper=The Irish Times|date=5 May 2001|accessdate=22 April 2011}}</ref>\n\n===Honours===\n* Crystal Globe - [[Karlovy Vary International Film Festival]], Czech Republic ('''nominated''')\n* Actress of the Year (Georgina Cates) - [[London Film Critics Circle]] ('''nominated''')\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|0112427|An Awfully Big Adventure}}\n* {{mojo title|awfullybigadventure|An Awfully Big Adventure}}\n* {{rotten-tomatoes|awfully_big_adventure|An Awfully Big Adventure}}\n\n{{Mike Newell}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Awfully Big Adventure, An}}\n[[Category:1995 films]]\n[[Category:1995 LGBT-related films]]\n[[Category:British comedy-drama films]]\n[[Category:British coming-of-age films]]\n[[Category:British independent films]]\n[[Category:British LGBT-related films]]\n[[Category:1990s English-language films]]\n[[Category:Films about actors]]\n[[Category:Films based on British novels]]\n[[Category:Films set in 1947]]\n[[Category:Films set in Liverpool]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Mike Newell]]\n[[Category:Incest in film]]\n[[Category:Juvenile sexuality in films]]\n[[Category:1990s British films]]"}]}}}}
