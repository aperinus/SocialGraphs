Jia-Jen, the eldest, is a chemistry teacher who devotes herself to Christianity after facing heartbreak from her college ex-boyfriend. The second daughter, Jia-Chien, is an executive at an airline company. She wanted to become a head chef like her father but he claimed that it was not for a woman. Jia-Ning, the youngest, is a college student who works part-time at a [[Wendy's]] fast food restaurant.\n\nAt dinner, Jia-Chien announces that she has invested in a new apartment and will be moving out once construction is complete. Surprisingly, Mr. Zhu approves. Jia-Chien criticizes the flavor, claiming Mr. Zhu's taste is deteriorating. Mr. Zhu dismisses the idea before suddenly rushing off to help his (and Jia-Chien's) long-time friend and \"taster\", Old Wen, at a banquet. Afterwards, Mr. Zhu wonders with Old Wen if there is anything more to life than eating, drinking, man, and woman. Meanwhile, family friend Jin-Rong stops by the Zhu residence with her daughter Shan-Shan. Jin-Rong vocalizes her difficulties with a messy divorce while being responsible for work, Shan-Shan, and her opinionated mother, Madame Liang, as she returns to Taipei from America. Jia-Jen comforts her while Shan-Shan colors a caricature of Mr. Zhu.\n\nThe next morning, Mr. Zhu meets Shan-Shan, learns that the lunches Jin-Rong provides her are suboptimal, and decides to cook for her. Shan-Shan agrees, giving Mr. Zhu the lunches her mom made to prevent her from discovering their secret. At school, Jia-Jen meets the new volleyball coach Ming-Dao and they take interest in one another. Jia-Chien meets the chief negotiator Li Kai during a meeting at work and they flirt with one another. She has a chance to relocate to Amsterdam due to a potential promotion. Jia-Ning meets up with Guo-Lun, her friend Rachel's on-and-off boyfriend. As Guo-Lun mopes about his unrequited love, Jia-Ning comforts him, telling him that true love is being with someone you can express your feelings to comfortably, leading Guo-Lun to realize his feelings for Jia-Ning.\n\nMeanwhile, Old Wen becomes hospitalized. Jia-Jen is fooled by love letters she believes are from Ming-Dao, falling for a prank by her students. Jia-Chien's apartment investment falls through as she discovers that the apartment company went bankrupt and ran away with her savings. She also learns that it was Li Kai who broke Jia-Jen's heart in college and avoids romance with him. Jia-Ning faces a dilemma when she begins dating Guo-Lun even after Rachel confesses that she loves him. Mr. Zhu's health deteriorates and secretly visits the hospital, unaware that Jia-Chien saw him while visiting Old Wen. Eventually, Old Wen passes away and Mr. Zhu concludes that his sense of taste has officially departed.\n\nAt another Sunday feast, Jia-Chien announces that she will no longer be moving out; Mr. Zhu tells her not to worry. Later, Jia-Ning reveals her relationship with Guo-Lun and her pregnancy. The next dinner, Jia-Jen divulges that she and Ming-Dao have eloped. Jia-Jen and Jia-Ning move out of the residence, leaving Mr. Zhu with Jia-Chien. Troubled, Mr. Zhu begins to confide in and meet Madame Liang, leading the daughters to believe that the two are romantically involved.\n\nWorried about her father's health, Jia-Chien rejects her promotion. Soon, the sisters, their partners, and Jin-Rong's family gather for a large Sunday feast. Mr. Zhu announces his engagement, not to Madame Liang, but to Jin-Rong, abruptly ending the dinner. Later, Jia-Ning and Guo-Lun have their baby, Jia-Jen converts Ming-Dao to Christianity, and Mr. Zhu sells the family home and buys a condo with Jin-Rong and Shan-Shan. Jia-Chien, no longer needing to take care of her father, accepts the job in Amsterdam. Before she leaves she prepares a final feast for the family in the family home, but only Mr. Zhu arrives. When Mr. Zhu criticizes her cooking, he suddenly realizes that his sense of taste has returned. The two hold each other\u2019s hands in the dining room, and call each other \u201cFather\u201d and \u201cDaughter\u201d.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Sihung Lung|Lung Sihung]] as Zhu ({{zh|c=\u8001\u6731|p=L\u01ceo Zh\u016b|l=Old Zhu}}), an aging master Chinese chef and the widower father of three adult daughters.\n* [[Yang Kuei-mei]] as Zhu Jia-Jen ({{zh|c=\u6731\u5bb6\u73cd|p=Zh\u016b Ji\u0101zh\u0113n|labels=no}}), the eldest daughter, who works as a [[high school]] teacher.

The family structure is eventually reconstructed when everyone\u2019s desire for eat, drink and sex is well balanced. At the beginning of the film, Zhu\u2019s&nbsp;family struggles between maintaining the banquet (eat and drink) and their sexual desire (man and woman). Food is the bond that holds the family together. However, though they dine together every week, they are afraid to confide in each other. When they focus on \u201ceat drink\u201d but suppress sexual desire, the family is unhappy. No one enjoys the meal and Zhu even loses his sense of taste. When Zhu, Jia Jen, and Jia Ning chase after their sexual desires (man and woman), the original family structure disintegrates, but the family becomes happier since everyone gets what they want. The desire for food and sex eventually reach a balance and Zhu\u2019s sense of taste is back at this moment.<ref>{{cite journal|title=\u4e07\u65b9\u6570\u636e\u77e5\u8bc6\u670d\u52a1\u5e73\u53f0|url=https://d.wanfangdata.com.cn/periodical/trsfgdzkxxxb200704005|doi=10.3969/j.issn.1673-9639.2007.04.005|access-date=2021-06-14|website=d.wanfangdata.com.cn}}</ref>\n\nEach character in this film has their own desire but at the beginning of the film, due to the concern with their family roles, they cannot express themselves.\n\n== Production ==\n''Eat Drink Man Woman'' was filmed on-location in director [[Ang Lee]]'s hometown [[Taipei]].

In 2019, produced by PerfectMatch Theatre co., LTD, the National Kaohsiung Centre for the Arts put on a musical production titled, ''Eat Drink Man Woman: The Musical''. The musical is a direct adaptation of the film. With a total runtime of 160 minutes, the production strived to showcase as many iconic aspects from Ang Lee's film, such as the character's unique qualities and the beauty of food, through song and dance as possible. Unfortunately, the musical only ran for a recorded three days in September 2019; the production had a total of one night showing and two matinees.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Eat Drink Man Woman, the musical - Programs {{!}} National Kaohsiung Center for the Arts (Weiwuying)|url=https://www.npac-weiwuying.org/programs/5d2ef1162f7e790006461eea|access-date=2021-06-14|website=www.npac-weiwuying.org|language=en}}</ref>\n\n== Father Knows Best trilogy ==\n''Eat Drink Man Woman'' is Ang Lee\u2019s third feature film and forms the final part of his \u2018Father Knows Best\u2019 Trilogy, following [[Pushing Hands (film)|''Pushing Hands'' (1991)]] and [[The Wedding Banquet|''The Wedding Banquet'' (1993)]].
