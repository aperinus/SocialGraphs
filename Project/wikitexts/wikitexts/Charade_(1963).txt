[[Henry Mancini]]'s score features the popular theme song \"[[Charade (1963 song)|Charade]]\".\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- PER WP:FILMPLOT, PLOT SUMMARIES FOR FEATURE FILMS SHOULD BE BETWEEN 400 AND 700 WORDS. -->\nWhile on holiday in the [[French Alps]], Regina \"Reggie\" Lampert, an expatriate American working as a [[Simultaneous interpretation|simultaneous interpreter]], tells friend Sylvie that she is divorcing her husband, Charles. She also meets Peter Joshua, a charming American.\n\nOn her return to [[Paris]], she finds her apartment stripped bare. A police inspector says Charles sold off their belongings, then was murdered while leaving Paris. Their money is also missing. Reggie is given her husband's small travel bag, containing a letter addressed to her, a ship ticket to [[Venezuela]], four passports in multiple names and nationalities, and other miscellaneous personal items. At Charles' sparsely attended funeral, three men show up to view the body. One sticks a pin into the corpse to confirm Charles is really dead.\n\nReggie is summoned to meet [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] administrator Hamilton Bartholomew at the [[Embassy of the United States, Paris|American Embassy]]. She learns that the three men are Herman Scobie, Leopold W. Gideon, and Tex Panthollow. During [[World War II]], they, Charles, and Carson Dyle were assigned by the [[Office of Strategic Services|OSS]] to deliver $250,000 (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|.250000|1944|r=1}}}} million in current dollar terms) in gold to the [[French Resistance]], but instead stole it. Carson was fatally wounded in a German ambush, and Charles double-crossed the others, taking all the gold. The three survivors are after the missing money, as is the U.S. government. Hamilton insists Reggie has it, even if she does not know what or where it is&mdash;and that she is in great danger.\n\nPeter locates Reggie and helps her move into a hotel. The three criminals separately threaten her, each convinced she knows where the money is. Herman then shocks her, claiming that Peter is in league with them, after which Peter confesses he is Carson Dyle's brother, Alexander, and is trying to bring the others to justice, believing they killed Carson.\n\nAs the hunt for the money continues, Herman and Leopold are murdered. Hamilton tells Reggie that Carson Dyle had no brother. When she confronts Peter, he claims he is Adam Canfield, a professional thief. Although frustrated by his dishonesty, Reggie still trusts him.\n\nReggie and Adam go to an outdoor market where Charles' last known appointment was. Spotting Tex, Adam follows him. At the stamp-selling booths, Adam and Tex each realize that Charles bought some extremely valuable stamps and affixed them to the envelope found in his travel bag. Both men race back to Reggie's hotel room, only to discover the stamps missing from the envelope. Reggie, who gave the stamps to Sylvie's young son, Jean-Louis, suddenly realizes their significance. She and Sylvie locate Jean-Louis, but he has already traded the stamps to a dealer. They find the dealer, who says the rare stamps are worth $250,000 in total. He returns them to Reggie.\n\nReggie returns to the hotel and finds Tex's body with the name \"Dyle\" scrawled next to it. Convinced Adam is the murderer, a frightened Reggie telephones Hamilton, who says to meet him at the Colonnade at the [[Palais-Royal]]. Adam sees her and gives chase. At the Colonnade, Reggie is caught out in the open between the two men. Adam claims Hamilton is really Carson Dyle: surviving the German ambush, he became obsessed with revenge and reclaiming the treasure. Reggie runs into an empty theater and hides in the [[Prompt corner|prompt box]]. Carson is about to shoot her, but Adam activates a [[trapdoor]] under him, and Carson falls to his death.\n\nThe next day, Reggie and Adam go to the embassy to turn over the stamps, though Adam declines going in. Inside, Reggie discovers that Adam is really Brian Cruikshank, a U.S. Treasury agent responsible for recovering stolen government property. With his true identity now revealed, he proposes marriage to Reggie.\n\nThe film ends with a [[Split screen (film)|split-screen]] grid showing flashback shots of Cruikshank's four identities; Reggie says she hopes they have lots of boys, so they can name them all after him.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Cary Grant]] as Brian Cruikshank (alias Peter Joshua, Alexander Dyle, and Adam Canfield)\n* [[Audrey Hepburn]] as Regina \"Reggie\" Lampert\n* [[Walter Matthau]] as Carson Dyle (alias Hamilton Bartholomew)\n* [[James Coburn]] as Tex Panthollow\n* [[George Kennedy]] as Herman Scobie\n* Dominique Minot as Sylvie Gaudel\n* [[Ned Glass]] as Leopold W.

Stone then turned it into a novel, retitled ''Charade'', which found a publisher and was serialized in ''[[Redbook]]'' magazine, as many novels were at the time. The series caught the attention of the same Hollywood companies that had passed on it earlier. The film rights were quickly sold to producer/director Stanley Donen. Stone then wrote the final shooting script, tailored to Cary Grant and Audrey Hepburn, with Behm receiving story co-credit.\n\nHepburn shot the film in the fall of 1962, immediately after ''[[Paris When It Sizzles]]'', which was filmed that summer in a number of the same locations in Paris, but difficulties with the earlier production caused it to be released four months after ''Charade''.\n\nWhen the film was released at Christmas time, 1963, Audrey Hepburn's line, \"at any moment we could be assassinated\", was dubbed over with \"at any moment we could be eliminated\" due to the recent assassination of President [[John F. Kennedy]]. The dubbed word stood out quite clearly, so official video releases of the film have since restored the original dialogue, though some public domain videos taken from original release prints still carry the redubbed line.\n\nAt the end of the film, Hepburn lists Grant's aliases, concluding, \u201cI hope we have a lot of boys and we can name them all after you.\u201d In the [[The Criterion Collection|Criterion Collection's]] 1999 commentary, Stone laments the fact that the music swells to mask his \u201cbest closing line\u201d. Donen tells him he can say it now and get his own back. It is not clear whether they were not aware of the change\u2014on the same commentary, Donen denies the restoration of \u201cassassinated\u201d\u2014or if the soundtrack was altered after the commentary was recorded. Other discrepancies in the commentary include both men recalling that Grant was 60 at the time.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Charade: The Spy in Givenchy |url= https://www.criterion.com/current/posts/64-charade-the-spy-in-givenchy|date=2020-09-21|access-date=2022-05-20 |website=The Criterion Collection |language=en}}</ref>\n\nCary Grant, who turned 58 during filming, was sensitive about the 25-year age difference between Audrey Hepburn (33 at the time of filming) and himself, and was uncomfortable with their romantic interplay. To address his concerns, the filmmakers agreed to add dialogue that has Grant's character comment on his age, and Regina \u2014 Hepburn's character \u2014 being portrayed as the pursuer.<ref>{{Cite book | last = Eastman | first =  John | title = Retakes: Behind the Scenes of 500 Classic Movies  | publisher = Ballantine Books | year = 1989 | pages = 57\u201358| isbn = 0-345-35399-4}}</ref>\n\n==Critical reception==\n[[File:Audrey Hepburn Charade publicity photo.jpg|thumb|right|[[Audrey Hepburn]] publicity photo]]\n''Charade'' receives generally positive reviews, from 21st-century critics as well as contemporaries.
