The film is the sequel to ''[[Wayne's World (film)|Wayne's World]]'' (1992), which was itself adapted from a [[Wayne's World|sketch]] on [[NBC]]'s ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''.\n\n==Plot==\n[[Rock and roll]] fans Wayne Campbell and Garth Algar now host their [[public-access television]] show, ''Wayne's World'', from an abandoned factory in [[Aurora, Illinois]]. After an [[Aerosmith]] concert, Wayne has a dream in which he meets [[Jim Morrison]] and a \"[[Native Americans in the United States|weird naked (Native American) Indian]]\" in a desert. Morrison convinces Wayne that his destiny is to organize a major music festival. Wayne and Garth dub the concert \"Waynestock\" (a pun on \"[[Woodstock]]\") and hire Morrison's former roadie, Del Preston. Their early attempts to sign bands and sell tickets fail, and Wayne wonders if the endeavor is futile.\n\nWayne's girlfriend Cassandra, lead singer of the band Crucial Taunt, has a new producer, Bobby Cahn, who tries to pull her away from Wayne, and Illinois. Garth meets Honey Horn\u00e9e. After Wayne admits spying on her due to his suspicion of Bobby's ulterior motives, Cassandra breaks up with him and becomes engaged to Bobby. Honey Horn\u00e9e attempts to manipulate Garth into killing her ex-husband, but Garth ends the relationship.\n\nTickets are sold for Waynestock, but no bands arrive. Leaving Garth to keep the rowdy crowd in check, Wayne disrupts Cassandra's wedding before escaping the ceremony with her and they get back together, in a scene closely resembling the finale of ''[[The Graduate]]''. Meanwhile, Garth has [[stage fright]] during the concert. Wayne returns to find the bands have still not arrived.\n\nIn another desert dream, Wayne and Garth consult Morrison, who says that the bands will not come, and that all that matters is they tried. Unable to return to Waynestock, they become lost in the desert and begin to die of starvation. Finding this unacceptable, Wayne and Garth reenact the ending of ''[[Thelma & Louise]]'', driving their car off a cliff while trying to find the bands. Finally, Wayne and Garth admit that they just have to end the film with a standard [[happy ending]] in which the bands arrive, and Waynestock is a success. Morrison tells Wayne that he needed to organize Waynestock to learn that Cassandra loves him for who he is; and also that adulthood requires one to take responsibility while being able to find fun in life. Bobby arrives to Waynestock to pursue Cassandra, but is prevented from entering.\n\nIn a [[mid-credits scene]], the entire park is covered with trash after the concert. [[Keep America Beautiful|The \"weird naked (Native American) Indian\" begins to cry]], but he cheers up when Wayne and Garth promise to clean up.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Mike Myers]] as Wayne Campbell\n* [[Dana Carvey]] as Garth Algar<ref>{{cite web |url=https://productplacementblog.com/movies/cheer-laundry-detergent-used-by-kim-basinger-in-waynes-world-2-1993/|title=Cheer Laundry Detergent Used by Kim Basinger in Wayne's World 2 (1993)|last= |first= |date=December 13, 2018|website=Product Placement Blog|publisher= |access-date= |quote=}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Alexandria|first=Michelle|date= |title=WAYNE'S WORLD / WAYNE'S WORLD 2 \u2013 BY SEAN O'CONNELL|url=http://eclipsemagazine.com/waynes_world_waynes_world_2_by_sean_oconnell/|work=Eclipse Magazine|location= |access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Jacobson|first=Colin|date= |title=Wayne's World 2 (1993)|url=http://www.dvdmg.com/waynesworld2.shtml|work=DVD Movie Guide|location= |access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Klady|first=Leonard|date=December 9, 1993|title=Wayne's World 2|url=https://variety.com/1993/film/reviews/wayne-s-world-2-1200434844/|work=Variety|location= |access-date=}}</ref>\n* [[Tia Carrere]] as Cassandra Wong\n* [[Christopher Walken]] as Robert G. \"Bobby\" Cahn\n* [[Kevin Pollak]] as Jerry Segel\n* [[Ralph Brown]] as Del Preston\n* [[James Hong]] as Jeff Wong, Cassandra's father and martial arts expert\n** [[Jim Downey (comedian)|Jim Downey]] as the dubbed voice of Jeff Wong\n* [[Kim Basinger]]<ref>{{cite web |url=https://screencrush.com/waynes-world-2-then-and-now/|title=See the Cast of 'Wayne's World 2\u2032 Then and Now|last=Hayes|first=Britt|date=July 22, 2013|website=ScreenCrush|publisher= |access-date= |quote=}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Hochman |first=David|date=October 3, 1997|title=What's next for Kim Basinger|url=https://ew.com/article/1997/10/03/whats-next-kim-basinger/|work=Entertainment Weekly|location= |access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Willis, Monush|first=John, Barry|author-link= |date= February 2000|title=Screen World 1994|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=z8yFlYq1h7IC&q=Honey+Hornee&pg=PA178|location= |publisher= |page=178|isbn=9781557832016}}</ref> as Honey Horn\u00e9e<ref>{{cite book |last= Moser|first=Margaret|author-link= |date= April 2011|title=Movie Stars Do the Dumbest Things|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_66gMFl2IjAC&q=wayne%27s+world+2+kim+basinger&pg=PT36|location= |publisher= |page=18|isbn=9781429978378}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Erickson|first=Glenn|date= |title=Wayne's World, Wayne's World 2|url=https://www.dvdtalk.com/dvdsavant/s282wayne.html|work=DD Savant|location= |access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Duprey|first=David|date=August 26, 2015|title=Wayne's World 2 and the BETTER ACTOR Moment|url=https://www.thatmomentin.com/waynes-world-2/|work=That Moment In|location= |access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://getyarn.io/yarn-clip/aee52a90-3b8b-433b-ae40-4943151641be|title=You mean, kill your husband?|last= |first= |date= |website=Get Yarn|publisher= |access-date= |quote=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.imfdb.org/wiki/Wayne%27s_World_2|title=Wayne's World 2|last= |first= |date=October 18, 2020|website=Internet Movie Firearms Database|publisher= |access-date= |quote=}}</ref>\n* [[Chris Farley]] as Milton, an aimless friend of Wayne and Garth's\n* [[Ed O'Neill]] as Glen\n* Gavin Grazer as Scott\n* Michael A.
