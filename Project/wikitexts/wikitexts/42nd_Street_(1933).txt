Starring an [[ensemble cast]] of [[Warner Baxter]], [[Bebe Daniels]], [[George Brent]], [[Ruby Keeler]], [[Dick Powell]] and [[Ginger Rogers]], the film revolved around the rehearsals of a Broadway show at the height of the Great Depression, and its cast and crew. The film was choreographed by [[Busby Berkeley]], with music by [[Harry Warren]] and lyrics by [[Al Dubin]].\n\nThis [[backstage musical]] was very successful at the box office and is now a classic. The film was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Picture]] at the [[6th Academy Awards]]. In 1998, it was selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\". In 2006, it ranked 13th on the [[American Film Institute]]'s [[AFI's 100 Years of Musicals|list of best musicals]]. A [[42nd Street (musical)|stage adaption of the film]] debuted on Broadway in 1980, winning two Tony Awards, including Best Musical.\n\n== Plot ==\n[[File:42nd-Street-Merkel-Keeler-Rogers.jpg|thumb|260px|[[Una Merkel]], [[Ruby Keeler]] and [[Ginger Rogers]] in ''42nd Street'']]\nIt is 1932, the depth of the [[Great Depression]], and noted Broadway producers Jones and Barry are putting on ''Pretty Lady'', a musical starring Dorothy Brock. She is involved with wealthy Abner Dillon, the show's \"angel\" (financial backer), but while she is busy keeping him both hooked and at arm's length, she is secretly seeing her old [[vaudeville]] partner, out-of-work Pat Denning.\n\nJulian Marsh is hired to direct, although his doctor warns that he risks his life if he continues in his high-pressure profession. Despite a long string of successes he's broke, a result of the 1929 [[Wall Street Crash of 1929|Stock Market Crash]], so he must make his last show a hit, in order to have enough money to retire.\n\nCast selection and rehearsals begin amidst fierce competition, with not a few \"[[casting couch]]\" innuendos flying around. Na\u00efve newcomer Peggy Sawyer, who arrives in New York from her home in [[Allentown, Pennsylvania]], is duped and ignored until two experienced chorines, Lorraine Fleming and Ann \"Anytime Annie\" Lowell, take her under their wing. Lorraine is assured a job because of her relationship with dance director Andy Lee; she also sees to it that Ann and Peggy are chosen. The show's juvenile lead, Billy Lawler, takes an immediate liking to Peggy (after her being tricked into bursting into his dressing room), as does Pat.\n[[File:JulPeg42ndSt1933Trailer.jpg|thumb|right|270px|Naive newcomer Peggy makes her first ''faux pas'', antagonizing tough director Julian Marsh.]]\nWhen Marsh learns about Dorothy's relationship with Pat, he sends some thugs led by his gangster friend Slim Murphy to rough him up. That, plus her realization that their situation is unhealthy, makes Dorothy and Pat agree not to see each other for a while. He gets a stock job in Philadelphia.\n\nRehearsals continue for five weeks, to Marsh's complete dissatisfaction, until the night before the show's surprise opening in Philadelphia, when Dorothy breaks her ankle. By the next morning, Abner has quarreled with her and wants Marsh to replace her with his new girlfriend, Annie. Annie confesses in earnest that she can't carry the show, but convinces the director that the inexperienced Peggy can. With 200 jobs and his future riding on the outcome, a desperate Julian rehearses Peggy mercilessly until an hour before the premiere, vowing \"I'll either have a live leading lady or a dead chorus girl.\"\n\nBilly finally gets up the nerve to tell Peggy he loves her. They embrace and kiss, just as Dorothy shows up and walks through the door.  Surprisingly, she wishes Peggy the best of luck and reveals that she and Pat are finally getting married. The show goes on to rousing applause. The last twenty minutes of the film are devoted to three [[Busby Berkeley]] production numbers: \"[[Shuffle Off to Buffalo]]\", \"(I'm) Young and Healthy\", and \"[[42nd Street (song)|42nd Street]]\".\n\nThe show is a hit. As the theater audience comes out, Julian stands in the shadows outside the stage door, hearing comments that Peggy is the star and that he, the director, doesn't deserve the credit for the show's success.<ref>Green, Stanley (1999) Hollywood Musicals Year by Year (2nd ed.), pub. Hal Leonard Corporation {{ISBN|0-634-00765-3}} page 20</ref>\n\n;Plot note\nIn the original Bradford Ropes novel, Julian and Billy are lovers. Since same-sex relationships were unacceptable in films by the moral standards of the era, the studio substituted a romance between Billy and Peggy. Although in one scene a gay innuendo is presented, as director Marsh puts his arm over choreographer Andy Lee's shoulder and asks if he has a date for the evening, who replies \"No.\" Immediately Marsh replies, \"Come on home with me will you? I'm lonesome.\"\n[[File:42nd Street lobby card 4.jpg|left|thumb|A lobby card for the film]]\n\n== Cast ==\n{{multiple image\n|align=right\n|direction=vertical\n|width=125\n|header=\n|image1=DanBaxtCred42ndSt1933Trailer.jpg\n|image2=KeelBrenCred42ndSt1933Trailer.jpg\n|image3=PowRogCred42ndSt1933Trailer.jpg\n|image4=MerkKibCred42ndSt1933Trailer.jpg\n}}\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Warner Baxter]] as Julian Marsh\n* [[Bebe Daniels]] as Dorothy Brock\n* [[George Brent]] as Pat Denning\n* [[Ruby Keeler]] as Peggy Sawyer\n* [[Guy Kibbee]] as Abner Dillon\n* [[Una Merkel]] as Lorraine Fleming\n* [[Ginger Rogers]] as Ann Lowell (aka \"Anytime Annie\")<ref name=Anytime>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aV-w98s8joQ Clip of first reference to Ginger Rogers' character as \"Anytime Annie\"], a pre-Code element in ''42nd Street'' (1933 film) on YouTube</ref>\n* [[Ned Sparks]] as Barry\n* [[Dick Powell]] as Billy Lawler\n* [[Allen Jenkins]] as Mac Elroy, the stage manager\n* [[Edward J.

Director Lloyd Bacon was not the first choice to direct \u2013 he replaced [[Mervyn LeRoy]] when LeRoy became ill. LeRoy was dating Ginger Rogers at the time, and had suggested to her that she take the role of \"Anytime Annie\".<ref name=Anytime/><ref name=tcmnotes />\n\nActors who were considered for lead roles when the film was being cast include [[Warren William]] and [[Richard Barthelmess]] for the role of Julian Marsh, eventually played by Warner Baxter; [[Kay Francis]] and [[Ruth Chatterton]] instead of Bebe Daniels for the role of Dorothy Brock; [[Loretta Young]] as Peggy Sawyer instead of Ruby Keeler; [[Joan Blondell]] instead of Ginger Rogers for Anytime Annie; [[Glenda Farrell]] for the role of Lorraine, played by [[Una Merkel]], and [[Frank McHugh]] instead of the diminutive George E. Stone as Andy, the dance director.\n\nThe film began production on October 5, 1932. The shooting schedule ran for 28 days at the Warner Bros. studio in [[Burbank, California]]. The total cost of making it has been estimated to be $340,000\u2013$439,000.<ref>IMDb [https://imdb.com/title/tt0024034/business Business Data for \"42nd Street\"]</ref><ref name=tcmoverview>TCM [https://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title.jsp?stid=616 \"42nd Street\" (1933) Overview]</ref>{{clear left}}\n\n== Musical numbers ==\n{{multiple image\n|direction=vertical\n|width=220\n|header=\n|image1=DanceNo1in42ndSt1933Trailer.jpg\n|image2=DanceNo2in42ndSt1933Trailer.jpg\n}}\nAll songs have music by Harry Warren and lyrics by Al Dubin.<ref>IMDb [https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0024034/soundtrack Soundtracks]</ref>\n* \"[[You're Getting to Be a Habit with Me]]\" \u2013 sung by Bebe Daniels ({{YouTube|bIA0lUZKBKI}})\n* \"It Must Be June\" \u2013 sung by Bebe Daniels, Dick Powell and the chorus\n* \"[[Shuffle Off to Buffalo]]\" [http://www.trainweb.org/wnyrhs/Shuffle.wav Song Clip] \u2013 sung and danced by Ruby Keeler and Clarence Nordstrom, with Ginger Rogers, Una Merkel and the chorus, ({{YouTube|aMdEqB-TB8g}})\n* \"Young and Healthy\" \u2013 sung by Dick Powell to [[Toby Wing]] and the chorus, ({{YouTube|mSvQtAnh_CI}})\n* \"[[42nd Street (song)|42nd Street]]\" \u2013 sung and danced by Ruby Keeler, and sung by Dick Powell ({{YouTube|klu_rjDMEkk}})\n\nThe \"Love Theme\", written by Harry Warren, is played under scenes between Ruby Keeler and Dick Powell, and Bebe Daniels and George Brent. It has no title or lyrics, and is unpublished.\n\nThe music playing during dance rehearsals and the opening of the show is an instrumental piano piece that Harry Warren wrote, titled \"Pretty Lady.\"\n\nA special patter with different music was written for the song \"Forty-Second Street\" and the production number of same, with music by Warren and lyrics by Dubin. It was cut for unknown reasons from the finished film, but an unpublished manuscript of this still exists.\n\nThough the songs of 42nd Street all allude to sex, there is a single moment at the end of \"Shuffle Off to Buffalo\", when one word of the scripted lyrics, \"belly\", was changed to \"tummy\" presumedly to comply with the then weakly enforced [[Motion Picture Production Code of 1930]]. But in making the change, the filmmakers purposely drew attention to the censored word.  During the last two verses, Una Merkel & Ginger Rogers sing about a traveling salesman who impregnates the farmer's daughter, and then is forced into a shotgun wedding. The lyric is: \"He did right by little Nellie, with a shotgun at his belly...\" But as Ginger Rogers sings it, Una gestures to her and she changes the last word: \"He did right by little Nellie, with a shotgun at his bel - - tummy\".\n\n== Reception ==\nThe film premiered in New York on March 9, 1933, at the [[Mark Strand Theatre|Strand Theatre]], and went into general release two days later, becoming one of the most profitable films of the year, bringing in an estimated gross of $2,300,000, equal to ${{Inflation|US|2300000|1933|fmt=c}} today.
