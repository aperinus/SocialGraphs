The film revolves around several young men from [[Western Australia]] who enlist in the [[Australian Army]] during the [[First World War]]. They are sent to the [[Gallipoli|peninsula of Gallipoli]] in the [[Ottoman Empire]] (in modern-day [[Turkey]]), where they take part in the [[Gallipoli Campaign]]. During the course of the film, the young men slowly lose their innocence about the purpose of war. The climax of the film occurs on the [[Australian and New Zealand Army Corps|Anzac]] battlefield at [[Gallipoli]], depicting the futile attack at the [[Battle of the Nek]] on 7 August 1915. It modifies events for dramatic purpose and contains a number of significant historical inaccuracies.\n\n''Gallipoli'' provides a faithful portrayal of life in Australia in the 1910s\u2014reminiscent of Weir's 1975 film ''[[Picnic at Hanging Rock (film)|Picnic at Hanging Rock]]'' set in 1900\u2014and captures the ideals and character of the Australians who joined up to fight, as well as the conditions they endured on the battlefield, although its portrayal of [[British Armed Forces|British forces]] has been criticised as inaccurate. It followed the [[Australian New Wave]] war film ''[[Breaker Morant (film)|Breaker Morant]]'' (1980) and preceded the 5-part TV series ''[[ANZACS (TV series)|ANZACs]]'' (1985), and ''[[The Lighthorsemen (film)|The Lighthorsemen]]'' (1987). Recurring themes of these films include the [[Culture of Australia|Australian identity]], such as [[mateship]] and [[larrikinism]], the loss of innocence in war, and the continued coming of age of the Australian nation and its soldiers (later called the [[ANZAC spirit]]).\n\n==Plot==\nIn [[Western Australia]], May 1915, Archy Hamilton, an 18-year-old stockman and prize-winning sprinter, longs to enlist in the [[First Australian Imperial Force|Australian Imperial Force]]. He is trained by his uncle Jack and idolises Harry Lasalles, the world champion over 100 yards. Archy wins a race with a bullying farmhand, Les McCann, Archy running bare-foot and Les riding his horse [[bareback]].\n\nFrank Dunne is an unemployed ex-railway labourer who has run out of money. He's an accomplished sprinter and hopes to win the prize money at the athletics carnival; he also bets a lot of money on himself winning. Archy and Uncle Jack journey to the athletics carnival. Frank is surprised when Archy defeats him, and is bitter at first and feels robbed of his bet. Eventually Frank approaches Archy in a cafe after getting over his loss. Archy gives all the prize money he won at the race to Jack and tells him that he will not be coming home for he has decided to enlist. They both decide to travel to [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]] and enlist there.\n\nAs Archy and Frank are penniless, they secretly hop on a freight train. However, as they awoke the next morning, they discover the train had stopped at a remote desert station instead of Perth. The station attendant informs them that they could either wait two weeks for the next train or walk 50 miles across the dry lake bed to reach a location with more frequent service. Archy immediately sets off while Frank chases behind in an attempt to persuade him to stay, reminding him that they could die in the desert much as members of the [[Burke and Wills expedition]] did. With Archy's navigation skills, the pair eventually reach a cattle station in safety. Upon arriving in Perth, they arrange to stay with Frank's father, an [[Irish Australians|Irish immigrant]]. Due to Frank's Irish heritage and general cynicism, he has little desire to fight for the [[British Empire]]. However, Archy persuades him to try to enlist in the [[Australian Light Horse]]. Failing to ride a horse, Frank enlists in the infantry with three co-workers from the railway: Bill, Barney, and Snowy. Many of the motivations for enlistment are revealed: wartime [[Anti-German sentiment|anti-German]] [[propaganda]], a sense of adventure and the attraction of the uniform. All soldiers embark on a transport ship bound for [[Cairo]]. Frank and Archy are separated and embark on different [[troopship]]s.\n\nSome months later, Frank and his fellow soldiers train near the [[Giza Necropolis|Pyramids]] and spend their free time in Cairo, drinking and visiting [[brothel]]s. During a training exercise, Frank and Archy meet once again; Frank is able to transfer to the Light Horse, as they are now being sent to the Gallipoli peninsula as infantrymen. They arrive at [[ANZAC Cove|Anzac Cove]] and endure several days of hardships and boredom in the [[trench warfare|trenches]]. Frank's infantry friends fight in the [[Battle of Lone Pine]] on 6 August. Afterwards, a traumatized Billy tells Frank what happened to the others: Barney has been shot and killed, and Snowy is in a hospital, but in such bad condition that he is denied food and water. The following morning, Archy and Frank are ordered to take part in the charge at the [[Battle of the Nek|Nek]], a diversion in support of the [[Landing at Suvla Bay|British landing at Suvla Bay]]. Archy is ordered by Major Barton to be the message runner. He declines the offer and recommends Frank for the role.\n\nThe Light Horse are to attack in three waves across a stretch of ground defended by [[Ottoman Empire|Turkish]] machine gunners. The first wave is to go at 4:30 AM, after an artillery bombardment. Unfortunately, the commanders' watches are unsynchronized and the bombardment ends too early. The brigade's commander, Colonel Robinson, insists the [[Australian and New Zealand Army Corps|ANZAC]] attack proceed; the first wave is cut down by the Turks within seconds. The second wave goes over, to a similar fate. Major Barton wants to halt the attack to end the carnage, but the Colonel says that somebody told him ANZAC marker flags were seen in the Turkish trenches, indicating that the attack was partially successful. The phone line goes dead. Barton gives Frank a message to carry to Brigade HQ but, when he arrives, the Colonel insists the attack continue.\n\nLieutenant Gray, Major Barton's second-in-command, admits to Barton that he was the soldier who said that he saw marker flags, though he did not remember who told ''him''. Frank suggests to the Major that he go over the Colonel's head to General Gardner. Frank hurries to Gardner's headquarters down on the beach. The General is informed that, at Suvla, the British landing party is brewing tea on the beach. He tells Frank that he is reconsidering the attack. Frank sprints back to convey this news, but the phone lines are repaired and Colonel Robinson orders the attack to continue. Barton joins his men in the attack, climbs out of the trench pistol in hand, and signals his men to charge. Archy joins the last wave and goes over the top. Frank arrives seconds too late and lets out a scream of anguish and despair. As Archy's companions are cut down by gun fire he drops his rifle and runs as hard as he can. The final frame freezes on Archy being hit by bullets across his chest, head back, as if breaking the tape at the finish of a [[100-yard dash|100-yard sprint]], and falling backwards.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Mark Lee (Australian actor)|Mark Lee]] as Archy Hamilton\n* [[Mel Gibson]] as Frank Dunne\n* [[Bill Kerr]] as Jack\n* [[Harold Hopkins (actor)|Harold Hopkins]] as Les McCann\n* Charles Yunupingu as Zac\n* [[Ron Graham (actor)|Ron Graham]] as Wallace Hamilton\n* [[Gerda Nicolson]] as Rose Hamilton\n* [[Robert Grubb]] as Billy (Lewis)<ref name=\"stratton4\">Railway Foreman: \"Dunne, Lewis, Wilkes!

An early scene in the film shows Uncle Jack reading from [[Rudyard Kipling]]'s  ''[[The Jungle Book]]'' about how [[Mowgli]] has reached manhood and now must leave the family of wolves that raised him. Actor [[Mel Gibson]] commented, \u201c[[Battle of Gallipoli|Gallipoli]] was the birth of a nation. It was the shattering of a dream for Australia.

The script went through many variations; the [[South Australian Film Corporation]] did not like an early draft and said they did not want to fund the film, which then had a proposed budget of A$4.5 million. In May 1979 Weir asked [[Patricia Lovell]] to produce the film. The script then began to focus on the story of two runners. Lovell managed to raise A$850,000, which was not enough to make the film.<ref name=\"stratton2\"/>\n\n===Associated R&R Films===\nOn 1 May 1980 [[Rupert Murdoch]] and [[Robert Stigwood]] announced they were forming a film company, R&R, later known as Associated R&R Films.

In his best-selling history, ''Gallipoli'', published in 2001, [[Les Carlyon]] agreed that the film unfairly portrays the English during the battle, with Carlyon laying the blame for the debacle squarely at the feet of Antill and 3rd Australian Light Horse Brigade commander [[Frederic Godfrey Hughes|Brigadier General Frederic Hughes]]: \"The scale of the tragedy of the Nek was mostly the work of two Australian incompetents, Hughes and Antill.\"<ref>Les Carlyon, \"Gallipoli\", 2001, p. 410.</ref> The film implies that the fictional and benevolent General Gardiner called off the attack, when in reality the attack petered out when half of the 4th wave charged without orders while the surviving regimental commander in the trenches, Lieutenant Colonel Noel Brazier, attempted to get the attack called off.{{citation needed|date=April 2022}}\n\nOther critics, Carlyon included, have pointed out that the Australian attack at the Nek was a diversion for the [[New Zealand Expeditionary Force]]'s [[Battle of Sari Bair|attack on Sari Bair]], not the British landing at Suvla. The British were therefore not \"drinking tea on the beach\" while Australians died for them. Two companies of a British regiment, the [[Royal Welch Fusiliers]], suffered very heavy losses trying to support the Australian attack at the Nek once it was realised that the offensive was in trouble.<ref>Les Carlyon, \"Gallipoli\", 2001, pp. 408\u2013409.</ref> Some have also criticised the film for its portrayal of British officers and their disdain for Australian discipline behind the lines. According to [[Robert Rhodes James]], no evidence for any such disdain on the part of British commanders for their Australian troops exists.<ref>Robert Rhodes James, \"Gallipoli\", 1965, pp. 274\u2013276.</ref> However, the British command's low regard for the discipline of Australian troops behind the lines has been widely documented by earlier historians, such as [[Charles Bean]], and more recent ones such as Carlyon, as well as by the oral tradition of survivors.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n\n==Awards==\nThe film was nominated for or won the following awards:<ref name=IMDbAwards>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0082432/awards IMDb: ''Awards for Gallipoli''] Retrieved 2013-04-23.</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

However the most striking feature of the soundtrack was the use of excerpts from ''[[Oxyg\u00e8ne]]'' by French [[electronic music]] pioneer [[Jean Michel Jarre]] during running scenes.  Quiet or sombre moments at Gallipoli, and the closing credits, feature the ''[[Adagio in G minor]]'', by [[Tomaso Albinoni]]. The film also features the ''[[Au fond du temple saint|Pearl Fishers' Duet]]'' by [[Georges Bizet]] playing on Major Barton's [[Phonograph|gramophone]] before the final attack, drawing a parallel between the bond shared by the ill-fated soldiers of the film and the fishermen in Bizet's opera.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Mystical Gaze of the Cinema|url=https://archive.org/details/mysticalgazecine00leon|url-access=limited|last=Leonard|first=Richard|publisher=Melbourne University Press|year=2009|isbn=9780522859942|pages=[https://archive.org/details/mysticalgazecine00leon/page/n189 179]\u2013180}}</ref>\n\nA soundtrack album was not released.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ringostrack.com/en/movie/gallipoli/21724|title=Gallipoli (1981) Soundtrack|website=RingosTrack|language=en|access-date=2017-09-29}}</ref><ref>{{Citation|title=Gallipoli (1981) IMDB|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0082432/soundtrack|access-date=2017-09-29}}</ref>\n\n==Influence==\nWith a budget of $2.6 million, ''Gallipoli'' received heavy international promotion and distribution and helped to elevate the worldwide reputation of the [[Cinema of Australia|Australian film industry]] and of later [[Australian New Wave]] films. The film also helped to launch the international career of actor [[Mel Gibson]]. Due to growing  popularity of the Gallipoli battlefields as a tourist destination in the 21st century, the film was shown each night in a number of [[hostel]]s and [[hotel]]s in [[Eceabat]] and [[\u00c7anakkale]] on the [[Dardanelles]]. In the ''[[20 to 1]]'' episode \"Great Aussie Films\", ''Gallipoli'' was listed as Number 1.{{citation needed|date=April 2022}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Cinema of Australia]]\n* [[World War I in popular culture]]\n* [[Landing at Anzac Cove]]\n* [[Battle of the Nek]]\n* [[Battle of Lone Pine]]\n* [[Gallipoli (2005 film)|''Gallipoli'' (2005 film)]] - a documentary\n* [[Chunuk Bair (film)|Chunuk Bair]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{wikiquote}}\n* {{rotten-tomatoes|1008074-gallipoli|Gallipoli}}\n* {{Metacritic film}}\n* {{IMDb title|0082432|Gallipoli}}\n* [http://www.ozmovies.com.au/movie/gallipoli ''Gallipoli''] at Oz Movies\n* [https://archive.today/20121127113346/http://colsearch.nfsa.afc.gov.au/nfsa/search/display/display.w3p;adv=yes;group=;groupequals=;holdingType=;page=0;parentid=;query=Number:8099;querytype=;rec=0;resCount=10 Gallipoli at the National Film and Sound Archive]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20110315212947/http://www.peterweircave.com/gallipoli/hart.html Peter Weir, Gallipoli (1981)]\n\n{{Peter Weir}}\n{{David Williamson}}\n{{Australian Film Institute Award for Best Film 1970\u20131989}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Gallipoli (1981 Film)}}\n[[Category:1981 films]]\n[[Category:1980s war drama films]]\n[[Category:Australian adventure drama films]]\n[[Category:Australian war drama films]]\n[[Category:1980s English-language films]]\n[[Category:War epic films]]\n[[Category:Anti-war films about World War I]]\n[[Category:Australian epic films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Peter Weir]]\n[[Category:Paramount Pictures films]]\n[[Category:Films about the Gallipoli campaign]]\n[[Category:Running films]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Adelaide]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Egypt]]\n[[Category:Films set in Western Australia]]\n[[Category:Films set in Egypt]]\n[[Category:Films set in the Ottoman Empire]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Turkey]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Flinders Ranges]]\n[[Category:ANZAC (Australia)]]\n[[Category:Films produced by Robert Stigwood]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Brian May (composer)]]\n[[Category:1981 drama films]]\n[[Category:Australian World War I films]]"}]}}}}
