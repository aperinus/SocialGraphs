An international co-production among the United States, the United Kingdom, Denmark, Germany, and Japan, the plot centers around a heist and man-made treachery amidst a [[natural disaster]] in a small [[Indiana]] town.\n\n== Plot ==\nDuring a heavy [[rainstorm]], Tom and Uncle Charlie, two [[armored truck]] drivers, are collecting money from banks in the town of [[Huntingburg, Indiana|Huntingburg]], [[Indiana]], which has been [[emergency evacuation|evacuated]] due to flooding. They are ambushed by Jim and his gang of armed robbers, Kenny, Mr. Mehlor, and Ray. Charlie calls the [[National Guard of the United States|National Guard]] and is shot dead by Kenny as Tom escapes and hides the cash in a cemetery.\n\nThe gang chases Tom, who takes refuge in a nearby church. There he is mistaken for a looter by Karen who knocks him out. Tom wakes up in a cell and tells Sheriff Mike Collig about the gang and the money. Sheriff Collig and Chief Deputy Wayne Bryce leave him locked up and investigate, whilst Deputy Phil is ordered to take Karen out of town. Karen pushes Phil out of the boat to return to protect the church, which she is restoring.\n\nThe town's [[dam]] operator Hank is forced to open a [[spillway]], causing a large wave and deeper flooding. Tom is trapped in his cell as the water rises. After protecting the church, Karen rescues him and they hide from the gang. Kenny is electrocuted. They enter a house and are mistaken for looters by the elderly residents Doreen and Henry Sears, who have refused to evacuate and are protecting their property. Henry is persuaded to give Tom their boat to return to the armored truck. Resurfacing from the submerged truck, he finds the gang holding the elderly couple hostage. Tom says he will tell them where the money is.\n\nJim reveals to Tom that Uncle Charlie was in cahoots with the gang, and did not actually call the National Guard; he was only killed because Kenny was not told Uncle Charlie was on their side. Tom finds the money has disappeared. They are ambushed by Sheriff Collig and his deputies plus Hank, who have found Karen and intend to keep the money for themselves.\n\nMr. Mehlor and Ray are killed in the shootout, and Jim and Tom escape and hide in the church. Wayne takes Karen to her house intending to [[rape]] her. The others petrol bomb the church and drive their boats through the stained glassed windows. Karen stabs and kills Wayne. Hank shoots Phil for not shooting Tom when he had the chance.\n\nThe dam overtop alarm sounds. Collig suggests Tom and Jim should let Hank and him go with a couple of the bags of money. Tom agrees, but Jim does not. Tom leaves to try to save Karen, before Collig shoots Jim with a revolver he was hiding, although Jim isn't badly hurt. Collig and Hank escape in a boat. Hank is pushed out by Collig and is killed in a gas explosion.\n\nTom finds Karen handcuffed to a banister. He frees her and they climb to the roof to avoid the water where they are caught by Collig. Jim comes from behind them in a boat. Collig shoots at him, disabling the steering, forcing him to go over the roof. As he does so, the engine breaks off and collides with the sheriff, knocking him into the water. Collig tries to shoot Karen as he grabs a bag of money, but Tom and Jim shoot the corrupt sheriff dead. Tom tells Jim he should leave, just as the State Police arrive. Jim picks up Collig's bag of money and rows away, as Tom tells Karen the fire damage to her church was not too bad and can be repaired.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Christian Slater]] as Tom\n* [[Morgan Freeman]] as Jim\n* [[Randy Quaid]] as Sheriff Mike Collig\n* [[Minnie Driver]] as Karen\n* [[Ed Asner]] as Uncle Charlie\n* [[Michael Goorjian]] as Kenny\n* [[Dann Florek]] as Mr. Mehlor\n* [[Ricky Harris]] as Ray\n* [[Mark Rolston]] as Chief Deputy Wayne Bryce\n* [[Peter Murnik]] as Deputy Phil\n* [[Wayne Duvall]] as Hank\n* [[Richard Dysart]] as Henry Sears\n* [[Betty White]] as Doreen Sears\n}}\n\n== Production ==\n=== Development ===\nThe production of the film was a collaborative effort among numerous film studios, one of which was the [[BBC|British Broadcasting Corporation]].

However, the film still retained that title in numerous other countries.\n\nThe film was shot in [[Huntingburg, Indiana]], where the film is set (in reality there is no major river or dam nearby, although there are two [[reservoir]]s near the town), as well as a $6 million set in an [[aircraft hangar]] in [[Palmdale, California]] where the [[B-1 Lancer]] bomber was manufactured, and some exteriors in [[Etobicoke]], [[Toronto]], Canada.\n\nAs of April 2016, upon speaking with the Huntingburg City Office, film historian Adam Nichols was informed of and shown a museum located upstairs in the city office where several props, costumes, media, and production stills are displayed featuring this film and the 1992 film ''[[A League of Their Own]]'' that was also partially filmed in Huntingburg.\n\nAbout the ending, Morgan Freeman said: \"I played a bad guy in a movie [''Hard Rain''] and they showed it to an audience \u2013 and we're letting an audience tell us what to do now \u2013 y'know, and the audience said, 'Well, I don't want him \u2013 Morgan can't die!'
