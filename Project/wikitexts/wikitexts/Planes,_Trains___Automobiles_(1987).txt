It stars [[Steve Martin]] as Neal Page, a high-strung marketing executive, and [[John Candy]] as Del Griffith, a goodhearted but annoying salesman. In spite of their differences, they share a three-day odyssey of misadventures trying to get Neal home to Chicago in time for [[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving Day]] dinner with his family. \n\nThe film received critical acclaim, with many praising it for Hughes branching out from teen comedies, and for the performances of Candy and Martin. The film has become a Thanksgiving Day tradition for many.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2020-11-26|title=Planes, Trains and Automobiles Is Being Celebrated as the Ultimate Thanksgiving Movie of 2020|url=https://movieweb.com/planes-trains-and-automobiles-thankgiving-movies/|access-date=2021-11-25|website=MovieWeb }}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n[[File:Planes trains automobiles route map.gif|thumb|left|Route taken by Del Griffith and Neal Page in the film]]\nNeal Page is an advertising executive on a business trip in [[New York City]], eager to return to his family in [[Chicago]] before Thanksgiving, which is in two days' time. After a late-running business meeting with an indecisive client, Neal struggles to hail a cab during rush hour. As he bribes a man to let him have a cab he has hailed, it is unwittingly taken by a third man. Neal arrives at [[JFK International Airport|JFK Airport]] just as his flight is delayed. While waiting, he meets the man who \"stole\" the cab, Del Griffith, a loquacious man who sells [[Curtain ring|shower curtain rings]]. To his chagrin (and Del's delight) Neal is then assigned a seat next to Del on the crowded flight to [[O'Hare International Airport|O'Hare]].\n\nDue to a blizzard in Chicago, their plane is diverted to [[Wichita Dwight D. Eisenhower National Airport|Wichita]], where they must stay overnight. Neal is unable to book a room, but Del has successfully reserved one. Neal reluctantly accepts Del's promise of a room if Neal pays for their cab ride to the motel. During check-in, Del mistakenly takes Neal's credit card. Forced to share the last available room, Neal loses his temper over Del's irritating behavior and lambastes him. Del is hurt by Neal's invective, but they calm down and awkwardly share the only bed. As they sleep, their cash is stolen by a burglar.\n\nThe following day, with air travel still prohibitively delayed, Neal buys them both train tickets to Chicago, but with seats in separate cars. However, the locomotive breaks down near [[Jefferson City, Missouri|Jefferson City]], stranding its passengers in a field. Neal takes pity on Del struggling with his [[Trunk (luggage)|trunk]], and they are reunited. They travel on a crowded bus to [[St. Louis]], where Del raises cash by selling curtain ring samples to passers-by as earrings. Neal offends Del over lunch and the two part ways again.\n\nAt the [[St. Louis Lambert International Airport|St. Louis airport]], Neal attempts to rent a car, but it is not there when he gets to the lot. After a long and perilous walk back to the terminal, Neal vents his anger in a profane tirade at the rental agent, but to no avail. He attempts to book a taxi to Chicago, but impatiently insults the dispatcher, who punches him. By chance, Del arrives at the scene in his own rental car, and takes the dazed Neal with him. As they drive, they argue again. After nightfall, Del nearly gets them killed by driving in the wrong direction on a freeway. As they compose themselves by the side of the road, Del's carelessly discarded cigarette sets fire to the car. Neal initially gloats, thinking that Del is liable for the damage, until Del reveals he had found Neal's credit card in his wallet and used it to rent the car.\n\nWith his credit cards destroyed in the fire, Neal barters his expensive watch for his own motel room. Del has nothing of value, so he attempts to sleep in the charred, roofless car. Neal eventually feels sympathy for Del and invites him inside. They share Del's collection of [[Miniature (alcohol)|miniature liquors]] and laugh about the events of the past two days. The pair resume driving to Chicago the next morning, but their car is impounded by the police as [[Roadworthiness|unroadworthy]]. Del persuades a trucker to take them into Chicago and they ride in the semi's refrigerated trailer.\n\nAt a [[Chicago \"L\"]] station, Neal sincerely thanks Del for getting him home, and they part ways with affection. As Neal rides a commuter train to his neighborhood, he thinks about the trip, recalling some of Del's odd comments and silences during the journey. It occurs to him that Del has not actually been trying to get home himself. Neal returns to the station, where he finds Del still sitting. Del explains that he is homeless, and that his wife died eight years earlier. Neal brings Del home with him for Thanksgiving dinner and introduces his family to his new friend.\n\nIn a post-credits scene, the client from Neal's Tuesday meeting is still in the conference room trying to decide which ad to choose, with a partially eaten Thanksgiving dinner on the table.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Steve Martin]] as Neal Page\n* [[John Candy]] as Del Griffith\n* [[Laila Robins]] as Susan Page\n* [[Michael McKean]] as State Trooper\n* [[Kevin Bacon]] as man running for taxi \n* [[Dylan Baker]] as Owen\n* Lulie Newcomb as Owen's wife\n* [[Olivia Burnette]] as Marti Page\n* [[Larry Hankin]] as Doobby\n* [[Richard Herd]] as Walt\n* [[Matthew Lawrence]] as Neal Page, Jr.\n* [[Edie McClurg]] as Car Rental Agent\n* [[Bill Erwin]] as Man on Plane\n* [[Ben Stein]] as Wichita airport representative\n* [[Diana Douglas|Diana Dill]] as Peg\n* [[Charles Tyner]] as Gus Mooney\n* [[Lyman Ward (actor)|Lyman Ward]] as John\n* [[Martin Ferrero]] as 2nd Motel Clerk\n* [[William Windom (actor)|William Windom]] as Mr. Bryant, the indecisive client (''uncredited'')<ref name=\"Windom\">{{Cite web|date=2016-12-01|title=Giving Thanks for Planes, Trains and Automobiles|url=http://www.norwoodlibrary.org/giving-thanks-for-planes-trains-and-automobiles/|access-date=2021-12-13|website=Morrill Memorial Library|language=en-US}}</ref>\n}}\n\n==Production==\n===Filming===\n''Planes, Train and Automobiles'' was filmed in 85 days,<ref name = \"ProVideo\">{{cite web|last=Hullfish|first=Steve|date=April 13, 2019|url=https://www.provideocoalition.com/art-of-the-cut-with-oscar-winner-paul-hirsch-ace/|title=ART OF THE CUT with Oscar winner, Paul Hirsch, ACE|website=Pro Video Coalition|access-date=November 25, 2019}}</ref> mostly in [[Batavia, New York]], and [[South Dayton, New York]].<ref>{{cite news|first=Marcia|last=Greenwood|url=https://www.democratandchronicle.com/story/lifestyle/2017/11/22/planes-trains-and-automobiles-filmed-batavia-1987/888031001/ |title=Planes, Trains and Automobiles filmed in Batavia: Behind the scenes |newspaper=[[Democrat and Chronicle]]|location=Rochester, New York|date=November 22, 2017|access-date=March 4, 2019}}</ref> A scene that takes place in St. Louis was filmed at [[Lambert International Airport]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://fox2now.com/2014/07/17/5-movies-with-locations-in-st-louis/|title=5 Movies With Locations in St. Louis|date=July 17, 2014|website=FOX2now.com|language=en|access-date=June 26, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=c2tZY-i6aa8C&q=%22planes+trains+and+automobiles%22+filmed+in+st+louis+airport&pg=PA104|title=Shot on This Site: A Traveler's Guide to the Places and Locations Used to Film Famous Movies and TV Shows|last=Gordon|first=William A.|date=1995|publisher=Citadel Press|isbn=9780806516479|language=en}}</ref> There was also a scene in [[Braidwood, Illinois]] at the Sun Motel.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://wgntv.com/news/wgn-investigates/planes-trains-automobiles-motel-in-braidwood-site-of-prostitution-bust-drug-overdoses/|title='Planes, Trains & Automobiles' motel in Braidwood site of prostitution bust, drug overdoses|date=March 29, 2019|website=WGN TV|language=en|access-date=August 3, 2021}}</ref> Rewrites Hughes did during filming made the amount of footage he shot much larger than what the original screenplay needed, and the first cut of the film was three hours and forty-five minutes long.<ref name = \"ProVideo\"/> A sub-plot about Neal's wife not believing him, and suspecting that he is with other women, was cut.<ref name=\"ProVideo\" />\n\n===Soundtrack===\nThe soundtrack to ''Planes, Trains & Automobiles'' features a mix of [[rock and roll]], [[Country music|country]] and pop.

Ebert wrote that the film \"is perfectly cast and soundly constructed, and all else flows naturally. Steve Martin and John Candy don't play characters; they embody themselves.
