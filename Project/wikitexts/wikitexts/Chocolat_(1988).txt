Marc and Aim\u00e9e Dalens ([[Fran\u00e7ois Cluzet]] and [[Giulia Boschi]]) are the parents of France (C\u00e9cile Ducasse), a young girl who befriends Prot\u00e9e ([[Isaach de Bankol\u00e9]]), a Cameroon native who is the family's household servant. The film was entered into the [[1988 Cannes Film Festival]]<ref name=\"festival-cannes.com\">{{cite web |url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/320/year/1988.html |title=Festival de Cannes: Chocolat |accessdate=2009-07-25|work=festival-cannes.com}}</ref>.\n\n==Plot==\nAn adult woman named France walks down a road toward [[Douala]], Cameroon. She is picked up by William J. Park ([[Emmet Judson Williamson]]), an [[African American]] who has moved to Africa and is driving to [[Limbe, Cameroon|Limbe]] with his son.  As they ride, France's mind drifts and we see her as a young girl in [[Mindif]], [[French Cameroon]] in 1957, where her father was a colonial administrator.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T7mrDwAAQBAJ&q=Mindif+chocolat&pg=PA166|title=Cinema and Landscape: Film, Nation and Cultural Geography: Film, Nation and Cultural Geography|first1=Graeme|last1=Harper|first2=Jonathan|last2=Rayner|date=January 1, 2010|publisher=Intellect Books|isbn=9781841503042|via=Google Books}}</ref>\n\nThe story is told through the eyes of young France, showing her friendship with the \"houseboy,\" Prot\u00e9e, as well the sexual tension between him and her young and beautiful mother, Aim\u00e9e.  The conflict of the film comes from the discomfort created as France and her mother attempt to move past the established boundaries between themselves and the native Africans.  This is brought to a head through Luc Segalen ([[Jean-Claude Adelin]]), a Western drifter who stays with the Dalens family after a small aircraft crashes nearby.  He acknowledges Aim\u00e9e's attraction to Prot\u00e9e in the presence of other black servants.  This later results in a fight between Luc and Prot\u00e9e, which Prot\u00e9e wins. During the fight, Aim\u00e9e sits nearby, unseen by the two. She attempts to seduce Prot\u00e9e after Luc has left but he rejects her advance.  Aim\u00e9e consequently asks her husband to remove him from the house.  Prot\u00e9e is moved from his in-house job to working outdoors in the garage as a mechanic.\n\nThe title ''Chocolat'' ({{IPA-fr|\u0283\u0254k\u0254la|}}, \"[[chocolate]]\") comes from the 1950s slang meaning \"to be cheated,\" and thus refers to the status in French Cameroon of being black and being cheated; it is also an allusion to Prot\u00e9e's dark-brown skin and the [[racial fetishism]] of Africans by Europeans. Towards the end of the film, France's father reveals a central theme of the film as he explains to her what the [[horizon]] is. He tells her that it is a line that is there but not there, a symbol for the boundaries that exist in the country between rich and poor, master and servant, white and black, coloniser and colonised, male and female; a line that is always visible but impossible to approach or pass.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Isaach de Bankol\u00e9]] as Prot\u00e9e\n* [[Giulia Boschi]] as Aim\u00e9e Dalens\n* [[Fran\u00e7ois Cluzet]] as Marc Dalens\n* [[C\u00e9cile Ducasse]] as France Dalens, as a girl\n* [[Mireille Perrier]] as France Dalens, as a woman\n* [[Jean-Claude Adelin]] as Luc\n* [[Laurent Arnal]] as Machinard\n* [[Jean Bediebe]] as Prosper\n* [[Didier Flamand]] as Captain V\u00e9drine\n* [[Jean-Quentin Ch\u00e2telain]] as Courbassol\n* [[Emmanuelle Chaulet]] as Mireille Machinard\n* [[Kenneth Cranham]] as Jonathan Boothby\n* [[Jacques Denis]] as Joseph Delpich\n* [[Clementine Essono]] as Marie-Jeanne\n* [[Essindi Mindja]] as Blaise\n[[File:Le pic de Mindif.jpg|thumb|The Mindif Peaks, depicted in the film.]]\n\n==Soundtrack==\nThe soundtrack, performed and recorded by Abdullah Ibrahim, was released in 1988 as ''[[Mindif (Abdullah Ibrahim album)|Mindif]]''.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LCRtDwAAQBAJ&q=Mindif+Chocolat&pg=PA45|title=Contemporary French Cinema: A Student's Book|first1=Alan J.|last1=Singerman|first2=Mich\u00e8le|last2=Bissi\u00e8re|date=September 15, 2018|publisher=Hackett Publishing|isbn=9781585108947|via=Google Books}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|0094868|Chocolat}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20061231024526/http://web.cocc.edu/cagatucci/classes/hum211/CoursePack/Chocolat.htm Film guide & resources for Culture & Literature of Africa course]\n\n{{Claire Denis}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Chocolat (1988 Film)}}\n[[Category:1988 films]]\n[[Category:1980s adventure drama films]]\n[[Category:Cameroonian drama films]]\n[[Category:Films set in Cameroon]]\n[[Category:Films set in 1957]]\n[[Category:1980s French-language films]]\n[[Category:French drama films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Claire Denis]]\n[[Category:Films set in the French colonial empire]]\n[[Category:1988 directorial debut films]]\n[[Category:1988 drama films]]\n[[Category:1980s French films]]"}]}}}}
