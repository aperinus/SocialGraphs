''The Last Waltz'' was advertised as The Band's \"farewell concert appearance\",<ref name = \"Poster\">Concert poster on the first page of the 2002 album booklet and in the DVD photo gallery states: \"The Band in their farewell concert appearance.\"</ref> and the concert had The Band joined by more than a dozen special guests, including their previous employers [[Ronnie Hawkins]] and [[Bob Dylan]], as well as [[Paul Butterfield]], [[Bobby Charles]], [[Eric Clapton]], [[Neil Diamond]], [[Dr. John]], [[Joni Mitchell]], [[Van Morrison]], [[Ringo Starr]], [[Muddy Waters]], [[Ronnie Wood]], and [[Neil Young]]. The musical director for the concert was The Band's original record producer, [[John Simon (record producer)|John Simon]].\n\nThe concert was produced and managed by [[Bill Graham (promoter)|Bill Graham]] and was filmed by director [[Martin Scorsese]], who made it into a [[Documentary film|documentary]] of the same title, released in 1978. [[Jonathan Taplin]], who was The Band's tour manager from 1969 to 1972 and later produced Scorsese's film ''[[Mean Streets]]'', suggested that Scorsese would be the ideal director for the project, and introduced [[Robbie Robertson]] and Scorsese. Taplin served as executive producer. The film features concert performances, intermittent song renditions shot on a studio soundstage, and interviews by Scorsese with members of The Band. The soundtrack and DVD were later released.\n\n''The Last Waltz'' is hailed as one of the greatest documentary [[concert film]]s ever made. In 2019, the film was selected by the [[Library of Congress]] for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] for being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".<ref name=\"Chow\">{{cite magazine |last=Chow |first=Andrew R. |date=December 11, 2019 |title=See the 25 New Additions to the National Film Registry, From Purple Rain to Clerks |url=https://time.com/5747503/national-film-registry-2019-additions/ |magazine=Time |location=New York, NY |access-date=December 11, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Women Rule 2019 National Film Registry |url=https://www.loc.gov/item/prn-19-116/women-rule-2019-national-film-registry/2019-12-11/|access-date=2020-11-23 |website=Library of Congress}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Complete National Film Registry Listing |url=https://www.loc.gov/programs/national-film-preservation-board/film-registry/complete-national-film-registry-listing/|access-date=2020-11-23|website=Library of Congress}}</ref>\n\n==Film synopsis==\n\nBeginning with a [[title card]] saying, \"This film should be played loud!\" the [[concert film|concert documentary]] covers The Band's influences and career. The group consisted of [[Rick Danko]] on bass, violin, and vocals, [[Levon Helm]] on drums, mandolin, and vocals, [[Garth Hudson]] on keyboards, saxophone and accordion, songwriter [[Richard Manuel]] on keyboards, drums, percussion and vocals, and guitarist-songwriter [[Robbie Robertson]] on vocals.\n\n[[File:The Last Waltz.jpg|thumb|alt=The Band standing onstage, encircling Dylan around a microphone|The Band, with Bob Dylan and guests, during \"I Shall Be Released\"]]\nVarious other artists perform with The Band: [[Muddy Waters]], [[Paul Butterfield]], [[Neil Young]], [[Joni Mitchell]], [[Van Morrison]], [[Dr. John]], [[Neil Diamond]], and [[Eric Clapton]]. Genres covered include [[blues]], [[rock and roll]], [[New Orleans Rhythm and Blues|New Orleans R&B]], [[Tin Pan Alley]] [[pop music|pop]], [[folk music|folk]], and [[rock music|rock]]. Further genres are explored in segments filmed later on a [[sound stage]] with [[Emmylou Harris]] ([[country music|country]]) and [[the Staple Singers]] ([[soul music|soul]] and [[gospel music|gospel]]).\n\nThe film begins with The Band performing the last song of the evening, their [[cover version]] of the [[Marvin Gaye]] hit \"[[Baby Don't You Do It|Don't Do It]]\", as an [[encore (concert)|encore]]. The film then [[Flashback (narrative)|flashes back]] to the beginning of the concert, and follows it more or less chronologically. The Band is backed by a large [[horn section]] and performs many of its hit songs, including \"[[Up on Cripple Creek]]\", \"[[Stage Fright (The Band song)|Stage Fright]]\", and \"[[The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down]]\".\n\nThe live songs are interspersed with studio segments and interviews conducted by director Martin Scorsese in which the Band's members reminisce about the group's history. Robertson talks about Hudson joining the band on the condition that the other members pay him $10 a week each for music lessons. The [[music education|classically trained]] Hudson could then tell his parents that he was a music teacher instead of merely a rock-and-roll musician. Robertson also describes the surreal experience of playing in a burnt-out [[nightclub]] owned by [[Jack Ruby]].\n\nManuel recalls that some of the early names for The Band included \"The Honkies\", and \"The Crackers\". Because they were simply referred to as \"the band\" by Dylan and their friends and neighbors in [[Woodstock, New York]], they figured that was just what they would call themselves.\n\nDanko is seen giving Scorsese a tour of The Band's [[Shangri-La (recording studio)|Shangri-La studio]], and he plays a recording of \"Sip the Wine\", a track from his then-forthcoming 1977 solo album ''[[Rick Danko (album)|Rick Danko]]''.\n\nA recurring theme brought up in the interviews with Robertson is that the concert marks an end of an era for The Band, that after 16 years on the road, the time had come for a change. \"That's what ''The Last Waltz'' is - 16 years on the road. The numbers start to scare you,\" Robertson tells Scorsese. \"I mean, I couldn't live with 20 years on the road. I don't think I could even discuss it.\"<ref>{{citation |date=April 2012 |title=The Last Waltz, directed by Martin Scorsese}}</ref>\n\n==Origins==\nThe idea for a farewell concert came about early in 1976 after Richard Manuel was seriously injured in a boating accident. [[Robbie Robertson]] then began giving thought to leaving the road, envisioning The Band becoming a [[Studio band|studio-only band]], similar to [[the Beatles]]' decision to stop playing live shows in 1966.<ref name=\"Page 17\">Fricke, The Last Waltz liner notes, 2001, page 17</ref> He was also concerned about the negative effects of being on the road too long:\n\n{{blockquote|I had become suspicious of the road. Look at what happened to this guy. Look at what happened to ''them''. These people who got crazy when they got on the road. This was not a healthy thing. I was telling the guys in The Band, \"I like the music we make together. But I don't want to go out there with it anymore. . . . We're not learning from it. We're not growing from it.<ref name=Graham/>}}\n\nThough the other band members did not agree with Robertson's decision, the concert was set at [[Bill Graham (promoter)|Bill Graham]]'s [[Winterland Ballroom]], where The Band had made its debut as a group in 1969.<ref name = \"Pages 25-27\">Fricke, The Last Waltz liner notes, 2001, pages 25\u201327</ref> Originally, The Band was to perform on its own, but then the notion of inviting Ronnie Hawkins and Bob Dylan was hatched and the guest list grew to include other performers. Robertson wanted to invite people who had been a strong influence on their music, people who represented various music styles, including New Orleans rock and roll, English blues, and Chicago blues.<ref name=Graham/> When he called Bill Graham, he said he wanted the concert to be a kind of celebration, the end of a chapter.<ref name=Graham/>\n\nWith only six weeks before the planned date, Robertson called director Martin Scorsese, whom he knew loved rock music and had worked at the [[Woodstock Festival]], to see if he would direct it as a concert documentary. When he mentioned some of the performers they had lined up, Scorsese reacted quickly:  \"''Van Morrison?'' Are you ''kidding?'' I ''have'' to do it. I don't have a choice.\"<ref name=Graham/> The group promoted the concert by appearing on the [[Saturday Night Live (season 2)|October 30 episode of ''Saturday Night Live'']], where host [[Buck Henry]] introduced them by saying they were about to disband on Thanksgiving. They went into a set of  \"[[Life Is a Carnival]]\", \"[[The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down]]\", and \"[[Stage Fright (The Band song)|Stage Fright]]\" and closed out the episode with a cover of \"[[Georgia on My Mind]]\" with Manuel on lead vocals.\n\n==Concert==\nPromoted and organized by Bill Graham, whose home turf was Winterland and who had a long association with The Band, the concert was an elaborate affair, with over 300 workers. Starting at 5:00&nbsp;pm, the audience of 5,000 was served [[turkey dinner]]s. There was [[ballroom dancing]], with music by the Berkeley Promenade Orchestra. Poets [[Lawrence Ferlinghetti]], [[Lenore Kandel]], [[Diane Di Prima|Diane di Prima]], [[Michael McClure]], [[Robert Duncan (poet)|Robert Duncan]], and Freewheelin' Frank gave readings.<ref name=Graham/>\n\n[[File:Levon Helm with drums.jpg|alt=Helm behind a drum kit|thumb|The Band's drummer and vocalist Levon Helm]]\nThe Band started its concert at around 9:00&nbsp;pm, opening with \"Up on Cripple Creek\", during the wind-down of which vocalist/drummer Levon Helm called out a humorous \"I sure wish I could yodel!\" This was followed by 11 more of The Band's most popular songs, including \"[[The Shape I'm In (The Band song)|The Shape I'm In]]\", \"[[This Wheel's on Fire (song)|This Wheel's on Fire]]\", and \"The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down\". They were backed by a large horn section with charts arranged by [[Allen Toussaint]] and other musicians.\n\nThey were then joined by a succession of guest artists, starting with Ronnie Hawkins. As the Hawks, The Band served as Hawkins' backing band in the early 1960s. Dr. John took a seat at the piano for his signature song, \"Such a Night\". He then switched to guitar and joined [[Bobby Charles]] on \"Down South in New Orleans\".\nA [[blues]] set was next with harmonica player Paul Butterfield, Muddy Waters, pianist [[Pinetop Perkins]], and Eric Clapton. As Clapton was taking his first solo on \"[[Further on Up the Road]]\", his guitar strap came loose. Clapton said \"Rob!\" and Robertson picked up the solo without missing a beat.\n\nNeil Young followed, singing \"[[Helpless (Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young song)|Helpless]]\" with backing vocals by Joni Mitchell, who remained off stage. According to Robertson's commentary on ''The Last Waltz'' DVD, this was so her later appearance in the show would have more of an impact. Mitchell came on after Young and sang three songs, two with the backing of Dr. John on [[conga]]s.\n\nNeil Diamond was next, introducing his \"Dry Your Eyes\" by saying, \"I'm only gonna do one song, but I'm gonna do it good.\" Robertson had also produced Diamond's album ''[[Beautiful Noise]]'' the same year and co-wrote \"Dry Your Eyes\", which during the concert he hailed as a \"great song\".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/neil-diamond-rock-and-roll-hall-of-fame-inductee-says-he-feels-very-lucky-20101214 |title=Neil Diamond, Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Inductee, Says He Feels 'Very Lucky' &#124; Music News |publisher=Rolling Stone |date=December 14, 2010 |access-date=September 15, 2013}}</ref>\n\nVan Morrison then performed two songs, a special arrangement of \"[[Too Ra Loo Ra Loo Ral|Tura Lura Lural (That's an Irish Lullaby)]]\" as a duet with Richard Manuel and his own show-stopper, \"[[Caravan (Van Morrison song)|Caravan]]\".\n\n[[File:Muddy Waters.jpg|alt=Waters on stage, wearing a suit|thumb|Bluesman Muddy Waters guested with The Band for the concert.]]\nCanadians Young and Mitchell were then invited back out to help the Band perform \"[[Acadian Driftwood]]\", an ode to the [[Acadians]] of Canadian history. The Band then performed a short set of some more of its songs before Bob Dylan came on stage to lead his former backing band through four songs.\n\nThe Band and all its guests, with the addition of Ringo Starr on drums and Ronnie Wood on guitar, then sang \"I Shall Be Released\" as a closing number. Dylan, who wrote the song, and Manuel, whose falsetto rendition had made the song famous on ''[[Music from Big Pink]]'', shared lead vocals, although Manuel cannot be clearly seen in the film and switched between his normal and falsetto voices between verses.\n\nTwo loose [[jam session]]s then formed. \"Jam #1\" featured the Band minus Richard Manuel playing with Neil Young, Ronnie Wood, and Eric Clapton on guitar, Dr. John on piano, Paul Butterfield on harmonica, and Ringo Starr on drums. It was followed by \"Jam #2\" with the same personnel minus Robertson and Danko. [[Stephen Stills]], who showed up late, took a guitar solo and [[Carl Radle]] joined on bass.\n\nThe Band then came out at around 2:15&nbsp;am to perform an encore, \"[[Baby Don't You Do It|Don't Do It]]\". It was the last time the group performed under the name \"The Band\" with its classic lineup. The five joined on stage at a Rick Danko concert in 1978. The Band reformed without Robertson in 1980 and headlined at The Roxy in Los Angeles with Scottish group [[Blue (Scottish band)|Blue]] supporting, guests were Dr. John and [[Joe Cocker]]. Rick Danko later performed at various Los Angeles venues along with Blue, and at his invitation, they recorded their ''LA Sessions'' album at Shangri-La Studios.\n\n==Film production==\n===Concert filming===\nRobertson initially wanted to record the concert on [[16 mm film|16&nbsp;mm film]].<ref name = \"Revisited\">{{cite video |first=Martin |last=Scorsese |author-link=Martin Scorsese |title=The Last Waltz Revisited |medium=DVD featurette |publisher=MGM/United Artists |date=2002}}</ref> He recruited [[Martin Scorsese]] to direct based on his use of music in ''[[Mean Streets]]''. Under Scorsese, the film grew into a full-scale studio production with seven [[35mm movie film|35&nbsp;mm]] cameras.\n\nThe cameras were operated by several cinematographers, including [[Michael Chapman (cinematographer)|Michael Chapman]] (''[[Raging Bull]]''), [[Vilmos Zsigmond]] (''[[Close Encounters of the Third Kind]]''), and [[L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Kov\u00e1cs (cinematographer)|L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Kov\u00e1cs]] (''[[Easy Rider]]'', ''[[Five Easy Pieces]]''). The [[Staging (theatre)|stage]] and [[lighting]] were designed by [[Boris Leven]], who had been the production designer on such [[musical film]]s as ''[[West Side Story (1961 film)|West Side Story]]'' and ''[[The Sound of Music (film)|The Sound of Music]]''. With [[Bill Graham (promoter)|Bill Graham]]'s assistance, the set from the [[San Francisco Opera]]'s production of ''[[La traviata]]'' was rented as a [[Theatrical scenery|backdrop]] for the stage. Crystal [[chandelier]]s were also hung over the stage.\n\nJohn Simon, who ran the rehearsals for the show, would give Scorsese details as to who sang what and who soloed when for each song. Scorsese meticulously [[storyboard]]ed the songs, setting up lighting and camera cues to fit the lyrics of the songs. But despite his planning, in the rigors of the live concert setting, with the loud rock music and the hours spent filming the show, there were unscripted film reloads and camera malfunctions. It was not possible for all songs to be covered. At one point, all the cameras, except L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Kov\u00e1cs', were shut down for a scheduled film reload as [[Muddy Waters]] was to perform \"[[Mannish Boy]]\".<ref name=\"Revisited\" /> Kov\u00e1cs, frustrated by Scorsese's constant instructions, had removed his [[Headphones|communications headset]] earlier in the evening and had not heard the orders to stop filming.<ref name = \"Page 49\">Fricke, The Last Waltz liner notes, 2001, page 49</ref> As Scorsese frantically tried to get other cameras up, Kov\u00e1cs was already rolling and able to capture the [[Cultural icon|iconic]] song by the blues legend. \"It was just luck,\" Scorsese recalled in the [[DVD documentary]], ''The Last Waltz Revisited''.<ref name=\"Revisited\"/>\n\nNotably omitted from the film is [[Stephen Stills]], who only performed in a jam session. Also omitted were performances by poets Lenore Kandel, Robert Duncan, Freewheelin' Frank Reynolds, [[Emmett Grogan]], [[Diane DiPrima]] and Sweet William. Both jam sessions were omitted from the film entirely.\n\n=== Unexpected negotiations with Dylan ===\n[[File:Bob Dylan and The Band - 1974.jpg|alt=The Band and Dylan onstage performing|thumb|Dylan and the Band, 1974]]\nWhile [[Bob Dylan]] had agreed to perform in the concert, which was being filmed, he decided during the intermission that he did not want his own performance filmed after all. He feared it might detract from his film,  ''[[Renaldo and Clara]]'', which he directed during the [[Rolling Thunder Revue]] tour, which ended months earlier.<ref name = \"Page 53\">Fricke, The Last Waltz liner notes, 2001, page 53</ref> However, [[Warner Bros.]] had agreed to finance ''Last Waltz'' only if Dylan would be in it.\n\nLevon Helm said that Scorsese \"went nuts\" upon hearing that Dylan changed his mind, while \"Robbie became totally pale.\"<ref name=Helm/> More than a million dollars would have been lost without Dylan's performance in the film, said Helm.<ref name=Helm/> [[Jonathan Taplin]], the Band's manager and producer of the film, was also beside himself, knowing that he had no influence over Dylan. He, along with Robertson and Scorsese, then went to Graham: \"''Bill''. You're going to have to go and talk to Bob.\"<ref name=Graham/> They knew that Graham had worked with Dylan before, such as during Graham's [[SNACK Benefit Concert]] a year earlier. They wanted Graham to explain to Dylan how dire the situation was, said Helm.<ref name=Helm/>\n\nAs Graham walked toward Dylan's dressing room, he tried to reassure them, \"Don't worry, I'm gonna make it happen.\"<ref name=Helm/> As they waited, there were frantic backstage negotiations between Graham and Dylan, recalls Helm:<ref name = \"SFgate\">{{cite news |last=Selvin |first=Joel |author-link=Joel Selvin |title=The day the music lived |publisher=San Francisco Chronicle |date=April 22, 2002 |url=http://www.sfgate.com/default/article/The-day-the-music-lived-Rereleased-Last-Waltz-2857293.php  | access-date = January 6, 2013}}</ref>\n\n{{blockquote|Man, they were all biting their nails.

In a sense, he really saved the day for us.\"<ref name=Graham/>\n\nAt one point during Dylan's performance, Robertson states that Lou Kemp, a close friend of Dylan, said 'We're not filming this.' And Bill just said, 'Get out of here, or I'll kill you'\"<ref name = \"Page 53\"/> Graham told him \"This is ''history'', don't mess with it!\" Kemp backed off.<ref name=Graham/> To add to the confusion, Scorsese said that when Dylan got on stage, the sound was so loud he didn't know what to shoot: \"Fortunately, we got our cues right and we shot the two songs that were used in the film.\"<ref>''Scorsese on Scorsese'', ed. Ian Christie, p.73; Faber & Faber, 1989</ref>\n\nAccording to Kemp, \"More or less, Bob got his way. I think they shot a little more than he wanted but they didn't shoot as much as ''they'' wanted.

The Band and Harris performed \"Evangeline\", which was also included in the film. Interviews with group members were conducted by Scorsese at the Band's Shangri-La Studio in [[Malibu, California]]. Additionally, Robertson composed ''The Last Waltz Suite'', parts of which were used as a [[film score]]. Finally, according to musical director John Simon, during post-production, the live recording was altered to clean up \"playing mistakes, out-of-tune singing, bad horn-balance in the remote truck.

He states that Robertson, who is depicted singing powerful backing vocals, was actually singing into a microphone that was turned off throughout most of the concert (a typical practice during their live performances).<ref name=Helm>{{cite book |last1=Helm |first1=Levon |author1-link=Levon Helm |author2=Davis |first2=Stephen |title=[[This Wheel's on Fire \u2013 Levon Helm and the Story of The Band|This Wheel's on Fire]] |publisher=A Capella Books |location=Chicago |year=2000 |pages=275\u2013277 |isbn=978-1-55652-405-9}}</ref>\n\nHelm was also dissatisfied with Manuel and Hudson's minimal screen time and the fact most of the band members never received any money for the various home videos, DVDs and soundtracks released by [[Warner Bros.]] after the project.<ref name=Helm/>\n\n===Appreciation by Robbie Robertson===\n{{quote box | align = right| width = 25em | bgcolor = LightCyan | quote = We saluted one another like we had just pulled off one of the best musical celebrations in rock 'n' roll history.

To all the people involved, he said \"Thank God we got through it.\"<ref name=Graham/> He recalls that all the cameramen were hugging one another, feeling they had succeeded in capturing a unique rock concert on film, all under the direction of Martin Scorsese, one of the film industry's leading directors.\n\nHe also thanked Graham for producing the concert at Winterland, where the Band had its debut in 1969:\n{{blockquote|I remember seeing Bill and I was thinking, \"God, you did it, Bill. Well, ''everybody'' did it.\" But Bill did it. We did it in ''his'' home. Like, \"Whose house are we going to shoot at?

A bonus scene is footage of \"Jam #2\", which is cut short because they had run out of replacement sound synchronizers for the cameras after ten hours of continuous filming.\n\nThe original 2002 DVD release was packaged as a \"special edition\". In addition to the extra features on the disc, the [[Amaray]] case came in a [[Embossing (paper)|foil-embossed]] cardboard sleeve, and inside was an eight-page booklet, featuring a five-page essay by Robertson entitled \"The End of a Musical Journey\". Also included was a US$5 rebate coupon for the four-CD box set.
