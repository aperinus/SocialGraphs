The film stars [[Harvey Keitel]] and [[Robert De Niro]]. It was released by [[Warner Bros.]] on October 2, 1973. De Niro won the [[National Society of Film Critics]] and the [[New York Film Critics Circle]] award for Best Supporting Actor for his role as \"Johnny Boy\" Civello.\n\nIn 1997, ''Mean Streets'' was selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] as \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".\n\n==Plot==\nCharlie Cappa, a young Italian-American in the [[Little Italy, Manhattan|Little Italy]] neighborhood of New York City, is hampered by his feeling of responsibility toward his reckless younger friend John \"Johnny Boy\" Civello, a small-time gambler and [[ne'er-do-well]] who refuses to work and owes money to many [[loan shark]]s. Charlie is also having a secret affair with Johnny's cousin Teresa, who has [[epilepsy]] and is ostracized because of her condition\u2014especially by Charlie's Uncle Giovanni, a powerful [[American Mafia|mafioso]]. Giovanni wants Charlie to distance himself from Johnny, saying \"[[Made man|honorable men]] go with honorable men.\"\n\nCharlie is torn between his devout [[Catholic Church|Catholicism]] and his illicit Mafia work for Giovanni. Johnny becomes increasingly self-destructive and disrespectful of his Mafia-connected creditors. Failing to receive redemption in the Church, Charlie seeks it through sacrificing himself on Johnny's behalf. At a bar, a loan shark named Michael comes looking for Johnny to pay up. To his surprise, Johnny insults him. Michael lunges at Johnny, who pulls a gun. After a tense standoff, Michael walks away and Charlie convinces Johnny that they should leave town for a brief period. Teresa insists on coming with them. Charlie borrows a car and they drive off, leaving the neighborhood without incident.\n\nA car that has been following them suddenly pulls up, with Michael at the wheel and his henchman, Jimmy Shorts, in the backseat. Jimmy fires several shots at Charlie's car, hitting Johnny in the neck and Charlie in the hand, causing Charlie to crash the car into a fire hydrant. Johnny is seen in an alleyway staggering toward a white light which is revealed to be a police car. Charlie gets out of the crashed vehicle and kneels in the spurting water from the hydrant, dazed and bleeding. Paramedics take Teresa and Charlie away while Johnny's fate remains unknown.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Harvey Keitel]] as Charlie Cappa\n* [[Robert De Niro]] as John \"Johnny Boy\" Civello\n* [[David Proval]] as Tony DeVienazo\n* [[Amy Robinson]] as Teresa Ronchelli\n* [[Victor Argo]] as Mario\n* [[Richard Romanus]] as Michael Longo\n* [[Cesare Danova]] as Giovanni Cappa\n* [[George Memmoli]] as Joey \n* [[Harry Northup]] as Soldier\n* [[Martin Scorsese]] as Jimmy Shorts\n* [[David Carradine]] as Drunk\n\n==Production==\nApart from his first actual feature, ''[[Who's That Knocking at My Door]]'', and a directing project given to him by early independent film maker [[Roger Corman]], ''[[Boxcar Bertha]]'', this was Scorsese's first feature film of his own design. Director [[John Cassavetes]] told him after he completed ''Boxcar Bertha'': \"You\u2019ve just spent a year of your life making a piece of shit.\" This inspired Scorsese to make a film about his own experiences.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/filmmakersonfilm/7366950/Martin-Scorsese-interview-for-Shutter-Island.html |title=Martin Scorsese interview for Shutter Island |location=London |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |first=Mick |last=Brown |date=March 7, 2010}}</ref> Cassavetes told Scorsese he should do something like ''Who's That Knocking at My Door'', which Cassavetes had liked. ''Mean Streets'' was based on events Scorsese saw almost regularly while growing up in New York City's [[Little Italy, Manhattan|Little Italy]].\n\nThe screenplay began as a continuation of the characters in ''Who's That Knocking''. Scorsese changed the title from ''Season of the Witch'' to ''Mean Streets'', a reference to [[Raymond Chandler]]'s essay \"[[The Simple Art of Murder]]\", where Chandler writes, \"But down these mean streets a man must go who is not himself mean, who is neither tarnished nor afraid.\" Scorsese sent the script to Corman, who agreed to back the film if all the characters were black. Scorsese was anxious to make the film so he considered this option, but actress [[Verna Bloom]] arranged a meeting with potential financial backer [[Jonathan Taplin]], the road manager for [[The Band]]. Taplin liked the script and was willing to raise the $300,000 Scorsese wanted if Corman promised, in writing, to distribute the film. The [[blaxploitation]] suggestion came to nothing when funding from [[Warner Bros.]] allowed him to make the film with Italian-American characters.<ref>{{cite web | last=Musto | first=Michael | url=http://blogs.villagevoice.com/dailymusto/2011/11/mean_streets_wa.php | title=Mean Streets Was Almost a Blaxploitation Flick! | work=VillageVoice.com |date=2011-11-01 |access-date=2016-10-20}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\nThe film was well received by most critics; [[Pauline Kael]] was among the enthusiastic critics, calling it \"a true original, and a triumph of personal filmmaking\" and \"dizzyingly sensual\".<ref>Kael, Pauline (1991).
