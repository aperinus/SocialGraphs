It stars [[Susan Sarandon]] as Louise and [[Geena Davis]] as Thelma, two friends who embark on a [[road trip]] that ends up in unforeseen circumstances. Filming took place in California and Utah from June to August 1990. The supporting cast include [[Harvey Keitel]], [[Michael Madsen]], [[Christopher McDonald]], and [[Brad Pitt]] in one of his first major film roles.\n\nThe film was a critical and commercial success, receiving six [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nominations and winning for [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay|Best Original Screenplay]]. Scott was nominated for [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]], and both Sarandon and Davis were nominated for [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]]. To date, this is the most recent film to have two actors nominated in the same category for either Best Actor or Best Actress. It influenced other films and artistic works and became a landmark of [[Feminist film theory|feminist film]].\n\nIn 2016, the United States [[Library of Congress]] selected the film for preservation in the [[National Film Registry]], finding it \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".\n\n== Plot ==\n\nBest friends Thelma Dickinson and Louise Sawyer set out for a weekend vacation at a fishing cabin in the mountains to take a break from their dreary lives in [[Arkansas]]. Thelma, a [[housewife]], is married to disrespectful and controlling carpet salesman Darryl, while sharp-tongued Louise works as a [[Waiting staff|waitress]] in a diner and is dating easygoing musician Jimmy, who is on the road most of the time.\n\nOn the way, they stop at a roadhouse bar, where Thelma dances with a flirtatious stranger, Harlan. He takes her to the parking lot and tries to rape her until Louise intervenes and threatens to shoot him. As the women walk away, Harlan yells vulgarities at them, so Louise shoots him in a fit of rage.\n\nThelma wants to go to the police, but Louise fears that no one will believe a claim of attempted rape as Thelma was drinking and dancing with Harlan, and they will be charged with murder. They decide to flee to Mexico, but Louise demands they travel there without going through [[Texas]], as something happened to her there that she refuses to reveal. Heading west, they come across an attractive young drifter, J.D., to whom Thelma takes a liking. Louise contacts Jimmy, asking him to wire her life savings to her. He surprises her by delivering the money in person, and they spend the night together. Jimmy proposes to Louise, but she refuses. Meanwhile, Thelma invites J.D. to her room, and they sleep together. She learns he is a thief who has broken [[parole]].\n\nThe following morning, they discover J.D. has stolen Louise's life savings and fled. Louise is distraught, so a guilty Thelma takes charge and later robs a nearby convenience store using tactics she learned from J.D.. Meanwhile, the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] closes in on them after witnesses at the bar identify Louise's 1966 [[Ford Thunderbird (fourth generation)|Ford Thunderbird]] convertible. Their whereabouts are also questioned by the owner of the fishing cabin after they failed to arrive.\n\n[[Arkansas State Police]] Investigator Hal Slocumb, leading the investigation, questions both J.D. (who was caught) and Jimmy, and taps into the phone line at Darryl's house. He sympathizes with the pair's situation and understands why they did not report Harlan's killing (partly due to Louise's own experience in Texas). During a few brief phone conversations with Louise, Hal expresses his sympathy but is unsuccessful in persuading her to surrender.\n\nThelma tells Louise she understands if she wants to go back home, knowing she has Jimmy waiting for her, but explains she cannot go back to Darryl. Louise promises they will keep going together. While back on the road, Thelma recalls the incident with Harlan and tries to ask Louise if what happened with Harlan was what happened to Louise in Texas. Louise responds angrily and tells Thelma to never bring it up again.\n\nLater, they are pulled over by a [[New Mexico]] state trooper for speeding. Knowing he will soon discover their true identity, Thelma holds him at gunpoint and locks him in the trunk of his police car. Driving further west, they encounter a foul-mouthed truck driver who repeatedly makes obscene gestures at them. They pull over and demand an apology from him; when he refuses, they fire at his fuel tanker, causing it to explode. The women leave him stranded in the desert with the tanker's wreckage.\n\nThelma and Louise are finally cornered by the authorities only one hundred yards from the edge of the [[Grand Canyon]]. Hal arrives on the scene, but he is refused the last chance to talk the women into surrendering. Rather than be captured, Thelma proposes that they \"keep going\". Louise asks Thelma if she is certain, and Thelma says yes. They kiss and then hold hands, Louise steps on the gas, and, as Hal desperately pursues them on foot, they accelerate over the cliff to their presumed deaths.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Susan Sarandon]] as Louise Sawyer\n* [[Geena Davis]] as Thelma Dickinson\n* [[Harvey Keitel]] as Arkansas State Police Detective Hal Slocumb\n* [[Michael Madsen]] as Jimmy Lennox\n* [[Christopher McDonald]] as Darryl Dickinson\n* [[Stephen Tobolowsky]] as FBI Agent Max\n* [[Brad Pitt]] as J.D.\n* [[Timothy Carhart]] as Harlan Puckett\n* [[Jason Beghe]] as State Trooper\n* [[Lucinda Jenney]] as Lena, The Waitress\n* [[Marco St. John]] as Truck Driver (uncredited)\n\nCredits adapted from [[American Film Institute]].<ref name=AFI>{{cite web|url=https://catalog.afi.com/Film/59064-THELMA-LOUISE|title=Thelma & Louise|publisher=American Film Institute|access-date=May 1, 2021|archive-date=May 1, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210501185545/https://catalog.afi.com/Film/59064-THELMA-LOUISE|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n== Production ==\n\n=== Development ===\n\nThe idea for ''Thelma & Louise'' originated in the spring of 1988 when [[Callie Khouri]], then a music video producer, was driving home from work to her apartment in [[Santa Monica, California|Santa Monica]]. She spent the following six months working on her first screenplay, which was noted to have drawn inspiration from her own experience as well as her friendship with country music singer [[Pam Tillis]].<ref name=VanityFair>{{cite web |last=Weller |first=Sheila |date=February 11, 2012 |title=The Ride of a Lifetime |url=https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2011/03/the-making-of-thelma-and-louise-201103 |newspaper=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]] |access-date=July 19, 2020 |archive-date=August 10, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200810045808/https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2011/03/the-making-of-thelma-and-louise-201103 |url-status=live }}</ref> She had intended it to be a low-budget [[independent film]], directed by herself and produced by fellow music video producer Amanda Temple (wife of English filmmaker [[Julien Temple]]).<ref name=VanityFair/> After shopping the project around and finding no takers, Temple showed the script to her friend Mimi Polk Gitlin, who ran [[Ridley Scott]]'s Percy Main Productions (later [[Scott Free Productions]]). Gitlin in turn showed the script to Scott, who expressed great enthusiasm for the project. He agreed to produce the film and bought the film rights for $500,000. [[MGM-Path\u00e9 Communications|Path\u00e9 Entertainment]], then led by Scott's friend and collaborator [[Alan Ladd Jr.]], came on board as a co-producer and financier.<ref name=VanityFair/>\n\nScott considered four people for the role of director, all of whom turned down the opportunity. Per Gitlin's recollection, three of the candidates were [[Bob Rafelson]], [[Kevin Reynolds (director)|Kevin Reynolds]] and [[Richard Donner]]. Scott was reluctant to direct the film himself but eventually took on the role, having been persuaded by [[Michelle Pfeiffer]].<ref name=VanityFair/>\n\n=== Casting ===\n\nMichelle Pfeiffer and [[Jodie Foster]] were originally chosen for the leads; both accepted their roles with enthusiasm. As pre-production of the film dragged on, the two eventually dropped out, with Pfeiffer going on to star in ''[[Love Field (film)|Love Field]]'' and Foster in ''[[The Silence of the Lambs (film)|The Silence of the Lambs]]''. [[Meryl Streep]] and [[Goldie Hawn]] then offered to play the leads, but Streep later dropped out due to scheduling conflicts while Hawn was not considered right for the part. Geena Davis (who had been vigorously pursuing the lead role for nearly a year) and Susan Sarandon were ultimately chosen. The two took extensive driving and shooting lessons in preparation for their roles.<ref name=VanityFair/>\n\nScott personally convinced [[Harvey Keitel]] to take on the role of Hal, the sympathetic Arkansas detective. The two had previously collaborated in Scott's feature directorial debut, the 1977 film ''[[The Duellists]]''. Davis recommended her ex-boyfriend [[Christopher McDonald]] for the role of Darryl, Thelma's controlling husband. Scott wanted [[Michael Madsen]] for Harlan, Thelma's would-be rapist, but Madsen was unwilling; he eventually won the role of Jimmy, Louise's boyfriend. [[Brad Pitt]] auditioned for the hustler J.D.; however, the part originally went to [[William Baldwin|Billy Baldwin]]. Pitt eventually secured the role after both Baldwin and his replacement dropped out.<ref name=VanityFair/> [[George Clooney]], [[Robert Downey Jr.]], [[Mark Ruffalo]], [[Grant Show]], [[John Mellencamp]], [[Dylan McDermott]], [[James LeGros]] and [[Dermot Mulroney]] were also considered for the role of J.D.<ref name=\"Harris\">{{cite web |url=https://www.vulture.com/2017/06/the-thelma-and-louise-role-robert-downey-jr-almost-got.html |title=Brad Pitt's Breakout Role in ''Thelma & Louise'' Almost Went to Robert Downey Jr.. |last=Harris |first=Hunter |date=June 27, 2017 |website=vulture.com |access-date=October 11, 2021}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.howardstern.com/show/2017/03/01/john-mellencamp-music-thelma-louise-brad-pitt-politics/|title=John Mellencamp is Still Making Music for Everybody, No Matter Who They Voted for|date=March 2017}}</ref> Davis did test scenes with Clooney, Show, Ruffalo and Pitt; her advice to the directors was to choose Pitt.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Perry |first1=Kevin |title='I was screwing up his audition': Geena Davis on the moment she knew Brad Pitt was perfect for Thelma & Louise |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/news/geena-davis-brad-pitt-george-clooney-thelma-louise-b2208284.html |website=[[The Independent]] |access-date=22 October 2022 |date=2022-10-22}}</ref>\n\n=== Filming ===\n\nPrincipal photography for ''Thelma & Louise'' began on June 11, 1990, and concluded on August 31, 1990.<ref name=AFI/> Although the setting for the film is a fictional route between Arkansas and the Grand Canyon, it was filmed almost entirely in the states of California and Utah.

It reveals the previously untapped talent of Mr. Scott (best known for majestically moody action films like ''Alien'', ''Blade Runner'' and ''Black Rain'') for exuberant comedy, and for vibrant American imagery, notwithstanding his English roots. It reimagines the buddy film with such freshness and vigor that the genre seems positively new.
