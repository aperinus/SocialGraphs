The film focuses on the [[Anterograde amnesia|amnesiac]] fish Dory (DeGeneres), who journeys to be reunited with her parents (Keaton and Levy).\n\nDisney plans to make a sequel to ''Finding Nemo'' since 2005 who tasked its [[Circle 7 Animation]] after disagreements with Pixar. While it never went into production, a script was uploaded to the official [[Raindance Film Festival]] website. Disney's acquisition of Pixar in early 2006 led to the cancellation of Circle 7's version of the film. A Pixar-made sequel was announced in April 2013. [[Thomas Newman]] returned to compose the score.\n\n''Finding Dory'' premiered at the [[El Capitan Theatre]] in Los Angeles on June 8, 2016, and was released in theaters in the United States on June 17. It was acclaimed by critics, garnering praise for its animation, emotional weight, voice acting and humor. It earned $1.029 billion worldwide, and became the [[2016 in film#Highest-grossing films|third-highest-grossing film of 2016]].

As she grows up, Dory attempts to search for them, but gradually forgets them due to her short-term memory loss. Later, she joins Marlin the [[clownfish]], looking for Nemo.{{efn|As depicted in ''[[Finding Nemo]]'' (2003).}}\n\nOne year after meeting Marlin and Nemo, Dory is living with them in their [[Great Barrier Reef|reef]]. One day, Dory has a [[flashback (psychology)|flashback]] and remembers her parents. She decides to look for them, but her memory problem is an obstacle. She suddenly remembers that they lived at the \"Jewel of [[Morro Bay, California]]\" across the ocean when Nemo mentions the name.\n\nMarlin and Nemo accompany Dory on her journey. With the help of Crush, their [[sea turtle]] friend, they ride the [[California Current]] to California. Upon arrival, they explore a shipwreck full of lost cargo, where Dory accidentally awakens a giant [[Humboldt squid]], who pursues them and almost devours Nemo. They manage to trap the squid in a large shipping container, and Marlin berates Dory for endangering them. Her feelings hurt, Dory travels to the surface to seek help where she is captured by staff members from the trio's nearby destination, the Marine Life Institute.\n\nDory is placed in quarantine and tagged. There she meets a grouchy seven-legged [[octopus]] named Hank. Dory's tag marks her for transfer to an aquarium in [[Cleveland, Ohio]]. Hank, who fears being released back into the ocean, agrees to help Dory find her parents in exchange for her tag. In one exhibit, Dory encounters her childhood friend Destiny, a nearsighted [[whale shark]], who used to communicate with Dory through pipes, and Bailey, a [[beluga whale]], who mistakenly believes he has lost his ability to [[animal echolocation|echolocate]]. Dory subsequently has flashbacks of life with her parents and struggles to recall details. She finally remembers how she was separated from her parents: she overheard her mother crying one night, left to retrieve a shell to cheer her up, and was pulled away by an [[Undertow (water waves)|undertow current]] out into the ocean.\n\nMarlin and Nemo attempt to rescue Dory. With the help of two lazy [[California sea lion]]s named Fluke and Rudder and a [[common loon]] named Becky, they manage to get into the institute and find her in the pipe system. Other blue tangs tell them that Dory's parents escaped from the institute a long time ago to search for her and never came back, leaving Dory to believe that they have died. Hank retrieves Dory from the tank, accidentally leaving Marlin and Nemo behind. He is then apprehended by one of the employees and unintentionally drops Dory into the drain, flushing her out to the ocean. While wandering aimlessly, she comes across a trail of shells; remembering that when she was young, her parents had set out a similar trail to help her find her way back home, she follows it. At the end of the trail, Dory finds an empty [[brain coral]] with multiple shell trails leading to it. As she turns to leave, her parents arrive. They tell her they spent years laying down the trails for her to follow in the hopes that she would eventually find them.\n\nMarlin, Nemo, and Hank end up in the truck taking various aquatic creatures to Cleveland. Destiny and Bailey escape from their exhibit to help Dory rescue them. Once onboard the truck, Dory persuades Hank to return to the sea with her, and together, they hijack the truck and drive it over busy highways, creating havoc, before crashing it into the sea, freeing all the fish. Dory, along with her parents and new friends, returns to the reef with Marlin and Nemo. Hank begins to adapt a happy lifestyle in the ocean and also becomes a teacher for Nemo's school.\n\nIn a [[post-credits scene]], the Tank Gang (from ''Finding Nemo''), still trapped inside their (now covered in [[algae]]) plastic bags, reach California one year after floating across the [[Pacific Ocean]], where they are picked up by staff members from the Marine Life Institute.\n\n== Voice cast ==\n<!-- PER CLOSING CREDITS, DO NOT CHANGE -->\n{{div col}}\n* [[Ellen DeGeneres]] as Dory, a [[Paracanthurus|regal blue tang]], who suffers from short-term memory loss.\n** Sloane Murray as young Dory.

So about 2010 when we were getting ''Finding Nemo'' ready for the 10-year re-release in 3D, it was interesting to watch again after all that time. Something kind of got lodged in the back of my brain and started to sort of stew. I started to think about how easily Dory could get lost and not find Marlin and Nemo again. She basically was in the same state that she was when Marlin found her. I didn't know where she was from. I knew that she had spent most of her youth wandering the ocean alone, and I wanted to know that she could find her new family, if she ever got lost again. It's almost like the parental side of me was worried.\" Stanton additionally stated: \"I knew if I ever said ''Finding Dory'' or mentioned a sequel to ''Finding Nemo'' out loud, I'd be done, [T]here would be no way I'd be able to put that horse back in the barn. So I kept it very quiet until I knew I had a story that I thought would hold, and that was in early 2012. So I pitched it to [[John Lasseter]] and he was all into it.

Now, I\u2019ve stopped saying never for anything because there are a lot of new characters that get introduced and we\u2019ve broadened the universe for this movie. And again, I\u2019m very used to seeing that world continue to open up from the Toy Story movies, so I\u2019ve learned to just say, to my knowledge, I think everything that was born of the first movie is wrapped up. But we\u2019ll see. With any of the other sequels, we strive to try and make it seem like it was inevitable, like it was meant to be, that all these extended stories and journeys with these characters were part of the whole canon. And that's really hard, but it's so satisfying for me when I\u2019m experiencing that, whether it's a great second season of a TV show or another book in a series. It's a small club when it's done successfully. Regardless of how much people may vocalize that they don\u2019t enjoy or wish that there weren\u2019t extensions, sometimes it's really nice to go back and spend more time with these characters if they evolve, if they grow, if they expand. So that, I\u2019m very happy with. I feel like it was just as hard, if not harder, on ''Finding Dory'' to get it to feel inevitable and preordained, and that it was always of the larger piece.\"<ref>{{Cite magazine|last1=Snetiker|first1=Marc|title='Finding Nemo 3'?
