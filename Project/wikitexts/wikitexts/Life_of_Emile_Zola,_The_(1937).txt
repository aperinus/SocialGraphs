It [[premiere]]d at the Los Angeles [[Carthay Circle Theatre]] to great critical and financial success. Contemporary reviews ranked it as the greatest biographical film made up to that time. In 2000, it was selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.\"<ref>{{Cite web|title=Librarian of Congress Names 25 More Films to National Film Registry|url=https://www.loc.gov/item/prn-00-200/librarian-of-congress-names-25-more-films-to-national-film-registry/2000-12-27/|access-date=2020-11-23|website=Library of Congress}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Complete National Film Registry Listing |url=https://www.loc.gov/programs/national-film-preservation-board/film-registry/complete-national-film-registry-listing/|access-date=2020-11-23|website=Library of Congress}}</ref>\n\nProduced during the [[Great Depression]] and after the [[Nazi Party]] had taken power in Germany, the film failed to explore the key issue of [[Antisemitism|antisemitic]] injustice in France in the late 19th century, when Zola became involved in the [[Dreyfus affair]] and worked to gain the officer's release. Some recent studies have noted the film as an example of Hollywood's timidity at the time: antisemitism was not mentioned in the film, nor was \"Jew\" said in dialogue. Some explicitly anti-Nazi films were canceled in this period, and other content was modified. This was also the period when Hollywood had established the [[Production Code]], establishing an internal censor, in response to perceived threats of external censorship.\n\n''The Life of Emile Zola'' became the second biographical film to win the [[Academy Award for Best Picture]].\n\n==Plot==\nSet in the mid through late 19th century, the film depicts \u00c9mile Zola's early friendship with [[Post-Impressionism|Post-Impressionist]] painter [[Paul C\u00e9zanne]] and his rise to fame through his prolific writing. It also explores his involvement late in the [[Dreyfus affair]].\n\nIn 1862 Paris, struggling writer Zola shares a drafty Paris attic with C\u00e9zanne. His fianc\u00e9e Alexandrine procures him a desk clerk job at a bookshop, but he is soon fired after he arouses the ire of his employer and an agent of police with his provocative novel ''The Confessions of Claude''. He then witnesses many injustices in French society, such as a crowded river slum, unlawful mining conditions and corruption in the army and government. Finally, a chance encounter with a street prostitute hiding from a police raid inspires his first bestseller, ''[[Nana (novel)|Nana]]'', an expos\u00e9 of the steamy underside of Parisian life.\n\nDespite the chief censor's pleading, Zola writes other successful books such as ''The Downfall'', a scathing denunciation of the French commanders' blunders and disunity that led to a disastrous defeat in the [[Franco-Prussian War]] of 1870. He becomes rich and famous, marries Alexandrine and settles down to a comfortable life in his mansion. One day, his old friend C\u00e9zanne, still poor and unknown, visits him before leaving the city. He accuses Zola of having become complacent because of his success and terminates their friendship.\n\nAn intercepted letter for the German embassy confirms that there is a spy within the French government. With little thought, the army commanders decide that Captain Alfred Dreyfus, a Jew, is the traitor. He is court-martialed, publicly degraded and imprisoned on [[Devil's Island]] in French Guiana.\n\nLater, Colonel Picquart, the new chief of intelligence, discovers evidence implicating Major [[Ferdinand Walsin Esterhazy|Walsin-Esterhazy]], an infantry officer of Hungarian descent, as the spy. But Picquart is ordered by his superiors to remain silent to avert official embarrassment, and he is quickly reassigned to a remote post.\n\nFour years have passed since Dreyfus's degradation. His loyal wife Lucie pleads with Zola to take up her husband's cause. Zola is reluctant to surrender his comfortable life, but Lucie brings forth new evidence to pique his curiosity. He publishes an [[J'accuse (letter)|open letter]] known as \"''J'accuse''\" in the newspaper ''L'aurore'' accusing the high command of covering up the monstrous injustice, and it causes a firestorm throughout Paris. Zola barely escapes from an angry mob incited by military [[Agent provocateur|agents provocateurs]] as riots erupt in the city streets.\n\nAs expected, Zola is charged with [[libel]]. His attorney Maitre Labori does his best against the presiding judge's refusal to allow him to introduce evidence about the Dreyfus affair and the perjury and biased testimony committed by all the military witnesses, except for Picquart. Zola is found guilty and sentenced to a year in prison and a 3,000-[[French franc|franc]] fine. He reluctantly accepts his friends' advice flee to London in order to continue the campaign on behalf of Dreyfus.\n\nWith the demand for justice reaching a worldwide level, a new French administration finally proclaims that Dreyfus is innocent, and those responsible for the coverup are dismissed or commit suicide. Walsin-Esterhazy flees the country in disgrace. Zola dies of accidental [[carbon monoxide poisoning]] caused by a faulty stove the night before the public ceremony in which Dreyfus is exonerated and inducted into the [[Legion of Honour|Legion of Honor]]. His body is buried in the [[Panth\u00e9on]] in Paris and he is given the farewell of a hero and warrior.\n\n==Cast==\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Paul Muni]] as [[\u00c9mile Zola]] \n* [[Gloria Holden]] as Alexandrine Zola  \n* [[Gale Sondergaard]] as Lucie Dreyfus  \n* [[Joseph Schildkraut]] as Captain [[Alfred Dreyfus]]  \n* [[Donald Crisp]] as Maitre [[Fernand Labori|Labori]]  \n* [[Erin O'Brien-Moore]] as Nana  \n* [[John Litel]] as Charpentier  \n* [[Henry O'Neill]] as Colonel [[Georges Picquart|Picquart]]  \n* [[Morris Carnovsky]] as [[Anatole France]], Zola's friend and supporter  \n* [[Louis Calhern]] as Major Dort  \n* [[Ralph Morgan]] as Commander of Paris  \n* [[Robert Barrat]] as Major [[Ferdinand Walsin Esterhazy|Walsin-Esterhazy]]  \n*  [[Vladimir Sokoloff]] as [[Paul C\u00e9zanne]]  \n* [[Grant Mitchell (actor)|Grant Mitchell]] as [[Georges Clemenceau]]  \n* [[Harry Davenport (actor)|Harry Davenport]] as Chief of Staff  \n* [[Robert Warwick]] as [[Hubert-Joseph Henry|Major Henry]]  \n* [[Charles Richman (actor)|Charles Richman]] as M.

Wallis]], Warner Bros.' executive producer for biographical pictures, assigned Herald and Geza Herczeg to develop the script. Their first treatment, titled ''Emile Zola: The Conscience of Humanity'', centered around the Dreyfus affair, with Zola's literary career merely a background plot. Herald and Herczeg saw Zola's struggles to be similar to those faced by [[Louis Pasteur]] in ''[[The Story of Louis Pasteur]]'', and their script ended with Zola triumphantly speaking out as a voice of truth as a parallel for the incipient turmoil taking place in Europe. Their 200-page script draft was submitted in November 1936, which staff writer [[Norman Reilly Raine]] was assigned to revise. Blanke supervised the creation of the final script, which included further contributions by Herald, Herczeg and Raine but also those from star [[Paul Muni]], director [[William Dieterle]] and Wallis. The final script was ready by February 1937, and an initial budget of $699,000 was allocated to the production of the film.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|last=Schatz|first=Thomas|title=The Genius of the System: Hollywood Filmmaking in the Studio Era|publisher=Pantheon Books|year=1989|isbn=0805046666|location=New York}}</ref>\n\nWallis and Blanke's relationship during production of the film was contentious; while Wallis wished to follow the successful formula established by ''The Story of Louis Pasteur'', Blanke fought for the integrity of the project. The two men clashed over nearly every aspect of production, including the casting of the female lead; Wallis wished to cast [[Josephine Hutchinson]], who had played Pasteur's wife, but Blanke disagreed and a compromise was reached in the casting of [[Gloria Holden]]. Blanke was determined to imbue the picture with authenticity and argued that Muni's appearance should differ starkly from that of the Pasteur picture, but Wallis, concerned with Muni's box-office appeal, overruled Blanke and instructed the makeup artist to maintain Muni's recognizable features above all else. Blanke threatened to leave the project following a bitter dispute over the hiring of a costumer, but Wallis relented.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nFilming began in March 1937 and was scheduled for 42 days. Muni's climactic courtroom speech was filmed in one six-minute take, but Wallis requested that Blanke and Dieterle intersperse the scene with crowd shots. Wallis and Blanke also argued over the quality of actor [[Ben Welden]]'s performance as [[Paul C\u00e9zanne]], and actor [[Vladimir Sokoloff]] was brought in to reshoot Welden's scenes. The reshoots caused the production of the film to extend ten days over schedule, and filming was completed on May 10.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nWallis and Blanke also fought over the film's title. While Wallis favored ''The Story of Emile Zola'', Blanke suggested alternatives such as ''The Truth Is on the March'', ''I Accuse'' and ''Destiny'' before ''The Life of Emile Zola'' was chosen, though the film does not actually depict much of Zola's life.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nMuni was paid $50,000 for his performance.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==Reception and interpretation==\nFollowing a successful preview screening that did not yet include [[Max Steiner]]'s musical score, ''The Life of Emile Zola'' premiered on August 11, 1937 and became an immediate sensation. Soon after, Warner Bros. placed full-page advertisements in several Los Angeles newspapers congratulating the cast and crew.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nContemporary reviews were nearly unanimous in their praise. [[Frank S. Nugent]] of ''The New York Times'' wrote: \n<blockquote>\"Rich, dignified, honest, and strong, it is at once the finest historical film ever made and the greatest screen biography, greater even than ''[[The Story of Louis Pasteur]]'' with which the Warners squared their conscience last year ...

Warner]] ordered the word \"Jew\" to be excised from the script and that [[Georg Gyssling]], the Nazi consul to the United States in Los Angeles, was occasionally allowed to review and provide recommendations on films before they were released, with changes sometimes made based on his comments.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/26/books/scholar-asserts-that-hollywood-avidly-aided-nazis.html|title=Scholar Asserts That Hollywood Avidly Aided Nazis|access-date=26 June 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=25 June 2013}}; Ben Urwand, ''The Collaboration: Hollywood\u2019s Pact with Hitler,'' Belknap Press, 2013. {{ISBN|9780674724747}}</ref><ref>\"Hollywood's Pact with Hitler.\" by Ben Urwand, C-SPAN Program, 11 December 2013</ref> However, Urwand's thesis that Warner was collaborating with the Nazis has been strongly disputed by Warner's family members, especially Alicia Meyer.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hollywoodessays.com/2013/08/21/a-rebuttal-to-ben-urwand-and-the-collaboration|title=A Rebuttal to Ben Urwand and The Collaboration: Hollywood's Pact with Hitler|date=21 August 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn his study ''Hollywood and Hitler, 1933\u20131939,'' Thomas Doherty also analyzed the topic.<ref name=\"denby\">{{cite magazine |last1=Denby |first1=David |title=Hitler in Hollywood |magazine=The New Yorker |date=16 September 2013 }}</ref> [[David Denby]], who wrote a long overview article about the issue in ''[[The New Yorker]]'', points out that while Doherty supports some of Urwand's thesis, Doherty provides more context for the studios' behavior, setting it against the political culture of the period. The studios were under social pressure during the [[Great Depression]] to produce films that helped the United States weather the crisis. There were fears of political radicalism in the U.S. while European movements, from the Nazis to communism in the Soviet Union, were considered threats.
