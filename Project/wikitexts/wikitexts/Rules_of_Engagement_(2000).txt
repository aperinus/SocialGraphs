Jackson]]. Jackson plays [[U.S. Marine]] Colonel Terry Childers, who is brought to [[court-martial]] after men under Childers' orders kill many civilians outside the U.S. embassy in [[Yemen]].\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per [[WP:FILMPLOT]], plot summary should be 400-700 words -->\nIn 1968 during the [[Vietnam War]], a disastrous American advance leaves [[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marine]] Lieutenant Hayes Hodges wounded and his men dead. His squadmate Lieutenant Terry Childers executes a [[Vietnam People's Army|North Vietnamese prisoner]] to intimidate a captive officer into calling off a mortar attack on Hodges' position; sparing the officer's life, Childers rescues Hodges. In 1996, Hodges, now a colonel, is set to retire after 28 years as a [[Judge Advocate General's Corps|JAG]] officer. At his pre-retirement party at the [[Camp Lejeune]] Officers Club, he is honored by his old friend, Colonel Terry Childers, now the commanding officer of a [[Marine Expeditionary Unit]].\n\nChilders and his unit are deployed to Southwest Asia as part of an [[Amphibious Readiness Group]], called to evacuate the [[U.S. Ambassador to Yemen]] when a routine anti-American demonstration at the embassy erupts in rock-throwing, [[Molotov cocktail]]s, and gunfire. Escorting Ambassador Mourain and his family safely to a helicopter, Childers retrieves the embassy's American flag. Under heavy fire from snipers on nearby rooftops, three Marines are killed, and Childers orders his men to open fire on the crowd, resulting in the deaths of 83 irregular Yemeni soldiers and civilians, including children; the remaining Marines and embassy staff are saved.\n\n[[U.S. National Security Advisor]] Bill Sokal pressures the military to [[court-martial]] Childers, hoping to salvage American relations in the [[Middle East]] by placing all blame for the incident on the colonel. Childers asks Hodges to serve as his defense attorney, and he reluctantly accepts. Hodges rejects a plea deal from the prosecutor, Major Biggs, who is convinced of Childers' guilt but privately refuses to consider the death penalty. With little time to prepare a defense, Hodges goes to Yemen, where witnesses and police claim that the Marines fired first on the unarmed crowd. Visiting the abandoned embassy and some of the wounded, he notices an undamaged security camera and scattered audio cassette tapes.\n\nReturning to the U.S., Hodges confronts Childers about the complete lack of evidence to support his version of events, resulting in a fistfight. Sokal burns a videotape revealing the crowd was armed and fired on the Marines, and forces Mourain to lie on the stand that the crowd was peaceful, and that Childers ignored his orders and was violent and disrespectful to him and his family. Hodges meets with Mourain's wife, who admits Childers acted valiantly but refuses to testify. Captain Lee, who hesitated to follow Childers' order, is unable to testify to having seen gunfire from the crowd. A Yemeni doctor testifies that the tapes Hodges found are propaganda inciting violence against Americans, but declares the protest was peaceful.\n\nWith Sokal on the stand, Hodges presents a shipping manifest proving that the tape from the undamaged camera \u2013 the tape Sokal burned \u2013 was delivered to Sokal's office but disappeared, with footage that would likely have exonerated Childers. Taking the stand, Childers explains that he was the only surviving Marine able to see the crowd was armed. On cross-examination, Biggs goads Childers into admitting that he ordered his men to open fire by shouting \"waste the motherfuckers\". Childers loses his temper, declaring that he would not sacrifice the lives of his men to appease the likes of Biggs, to Hodges' dismay.\n\nThe prosecution presents Colonel Binh Le Cao, the Vietnamese officer whose life he spared, as a rebuttal witness, testifying that Childers executed an unarmed prisoner of war. During Hodges' cross-examination, Cao agrees that Childers took action to save American lives, and that if circumstances were reversed, Cao would have done the same. After the trial, Hodges confronts Sokal about the missing tape, vowing to uncover the truth. Childers is found guilty of the minor charge of breach of peace, but cleared of conduct unbecoming an officer, and murder; Biggs approaches Hodges about investigating Childers' actions in Vietnam, but Hodges declines to testify. Leaving the courthouse, Cao and Childers salute each other.\n\nAn epilogue reveals that Sokal was found guilty of [[spoliation of evidence|destroying evidence]] and Mourain of [[perjury]], both losing their jobs, while Childers [[military discharge|retired honorably]].\n\n==Cast==\n<!--- Cast and order per closing tombstone credits, roles per closing credits scroll --->\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Tommy Lee Jones]] as Colonel Hodges\n* [[Samuel L.

In order to make the film in Morocco, the present King of Morocco had to read the script and approve it and sign his name ... and nobody participating from the Arab side of things felt that the film was anti-Arab. The film is anti-terrorist. It takes a strong stand against terrorism and it says that terrorism wears many faces ... but we haven't made this film to slander the government of Yemen. It's a democracy and I don't believe for a moment they support terrorists any more than America does.<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/films/2000/08/09/william_friedkin2_interview.shtml Films - interview - William Friedkin].
