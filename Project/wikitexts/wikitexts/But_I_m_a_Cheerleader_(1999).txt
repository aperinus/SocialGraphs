[[Natasha Lyonne]] stars as Megan Bloomfield, a high school [[cheerleader]] whose parents send her to a residential in-patient [[conversion therapy]] camp to \"cure\" her [[lesbian]]ism.\n\n==Plot==\nSeventeen-year-old Megan Bloomfield is a happy high school senior who loves cheerleading and is dating Jared, a football player. She does not enjoy kissing Jared and prefers looking at her fellow cheerleaders. This, combined with Megan's interest in vegetarianism and [[Melissa Etheridge]], lead her family and friends to suspect that she is a lesbian. With the help of [[ex-gay]] Mike, they surprise her with an intervention. Megan is then sent to True Directions, a [[conversion therapy]] camp which uses a five-step program to convert its campers to heterosexuality. Over the course of the program, Megan becomes friends with another girl at the camp, Graham. Though more comfortable in her sexuality than Megan, Graham was forced to attend the camp at the risk of being disowned by her family.\n\nAt True Directions, Megan meets the founder and strict disciplinarian Mary Brown; according to the film's backstory, Mary started True Directions after her husband left her for another man.<ref name=\":7\">{{Cite book |last=Sullivan |first=Nikki |title=A Critical Introduction to Queer Theory |publisher=Edinburgh University Press |year=2003 |isbn=0-7486-1597-0}}</ref> Mary Brown's \"heterosexual\" son Rock is seen throughout the film to be in fact overtly homosexual, and makes multiple sexual overtures towards Mike and the male campers. Megan meets a group of fellow young people trying to \"cure\" themselves of their homosexuality. After being prompted by the others, Megan agrees that she is a lesbian. This fact is at odds with her traditional religious upbringing and distresses her, so she puts every effort into becoming heterosexual. Early on in her stay, Megan discovers two boys, Dolph and Clayton, [[making out]]. She panics and screams. On their discovery by Mike, Dolph is made to leave and Clayton is punished with isolation, literally being sent to the [[doghouse]].\n\nThe camp's kids are encouraged to rebel against Mary by two of her former students, [[ex-ex-gay]]s Larry and Lloyd, who take the campers to a local [[gay bar]] where Graham and Megan's relationship develops into a romance. When Mary discovers the trip, she makes them all [[Picketing (protest)|picket]] Larry and Lloyd's house. Megan and Graham sneak away one night and begin to fall in love. When Mary finds out, Megan, now at ease with her sexuality, is unrepentant and made to leave. Disowned by her family and homeless, she goes to stay with Larry and Lloyd. Graham, afraid to defy her father, remains at the camp. Megan and Dolph, who is now also living with Larry and Lloyd, plan to win back Graham and Clayton.\n\nMegan and Dolph infiltrate the graduation ceremony, where Dolph coaxes Clayton away. Megan entreats Graham to join them as well, but Graham declines. Megan then performs a cheer for Graham, declaring her love and winning her over. They drive off with Dolph and Clayton. The final scene shows Megan's parents attending a [[PFLAG]] meeting to come to terms with their daughter's homosexuality.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Natasha Lyonne]] as Megan Bloomfield\n* [[Clea DuVall]] as Graham Eaton\n* [[Cathy Moriarty]] as Mary Brown\n* [[RuPaul Charles]] as Mike\n* [[Mink Stole]] as Nancy Bloomfield\n* [[Bud Cort]] as Peter Bloomfield\n* [[Eddie Cibrian]] as Rock Brown\n* [[Melanie Lynskey]] as Hilary Vandermueller\n* [[Wesley Mann]] as Lloyd Morgan-Gordon\n* [[Joel Michaely]] as Joel Goldberg\n* [[Richard Moll]] as Larry Morgan-Gordon\n* [[Kip Pardue]] as Clayton Dunn\n* [[Dante Basco]] as Dolph\n* [[Douglas Spain]] as Andre\n* Katrina Phillips as Jan\n* Katharine Towne as Sinead Lauren\n* Brandt Wille as Jared\n* [[Michelle Williams (actress)|Michelle Williams]] as Kimberly\n* [[Julie Delpy]] as Lipstick Lesbian\n}}\n\n==Production==\n===Background===\n''But I'm a Cheerleader'' was Babbit's first feature film.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web |date=2012-02-07 |title= Interview with Jamie Babbit |url=http://www.afterellen.com/archive/ellen/People/interviews/62004/jamiebabbit.html |access-date=2022-04-02 |website= AfterEllen.com |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120207185256/http://www.afterellen.com/archive/ellen/People/interviews/62004/jamiebabbit.html |archive-date=7 February 2012 |url-status=dead}}</ref> She had previously directed two [[short subject|short films]], ''Frog Crossing'' (1996) and ''[[Sleeping Beauties (film)|Sleeping Beauties]]'' (1999).
