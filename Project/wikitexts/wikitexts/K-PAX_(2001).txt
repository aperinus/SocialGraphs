An  American-German co-production, it was directed by [[Iain Softley]], starring [[Kevin Spacey]], [[Jeff Bridges]], [[Mary McCormack]], and [[Alfre Woodard]]. The film is about a psychiatric patient who claims to be an alien from the planet K-PAX. During his treatment, the patient demonstrates an outlook on life that ultimately proves inspirational for his fellow patients and especially for his psychiatrist.\n\n==Plot==\nAfter claiming he is an extraterrestrial from the planet 'K-PAX', 1,000 [[light years]] away in the [[Lyra]] constellation, prot (not capitalized and pronounced with a long O, rhyming with ''boat'') is committed to the Psychiatric Institute of Manhattan. There, psychiatrist Dr. Mark Powell attempts to cure him of his apparent delusions. However, prot is unwavering in his ability to provide cogent answers to questions about himself, K-PAX, and its civilizations. His medical examination only reinforces his story, as prot can see ultraviolet light and he is completely resistant to the effects of [[Thorazine]]. Powell introduces him to a group of astrophysicists who are befuddled when prot displays a highly detailed level of knowledge about his claimed star system that was unknown to them.\n\nprot also wins over the other patients at the Institute, each of whom believes unquestioningly that he is indeed from K-PAX. prot, who claims to have journeyed to Earth by means of \"faster-than-light travel,\" explains that he can take one person with him when he returns. Thereafter, most of the patients at the Institute ask prot to take them with him.\n\nUpon learning that many of his patients expect to leave Earth on July 27, Powell confronts prot, who explains that it is a predetermined date. However, Powell believes this to be a significant date in prot's life, a day on which he suffered a severe psychological trauma. Powell decides to subject prot to [[Age regression in therapy|regression hypnosis]], which works well. Using information gained from these sessions, Powell figures out that prot may simply be an alter ego of Robert Porter, a man from New Mexico who worked as a 'knocker' (animal slaughterer) in a local abbatoir, who attempted suicide in 1996 after his wife and child were murdered. Powell tries to confront prot with this knowledge, showing him a photo of Robert Porter in a high school yearbook and stating that it is in fact prot himself; but prot's reaction is one of bemusement, and he cryptically tells Powell that he hopes he will take good care of Robert now that he has found him.\n\nOn July 27 as the hospital staff watch, the camera in prot's room cuts to static at the precise time prot said he would leave Earth. Powell finds Porter lying on the floor in his room, catatonic, prot having apparently left Porter's body for the light travel back to K-PAX. As Robert is being wheeled out of the room, the other patients do not recognize him as prot and say that prot has gone. In addition, one of the patients is missing: Bess, a woman who had remained mute since her home was destroyed in a fire and who had been among the patients that asked to go to K-PAX with prot. She is never found. The other patients believe that prot has taken her to K-PAX. Powell continues to take care of the catatonic Porter and tells him about how the patients he helped have gone on to live normal lives again, but Robert does not respond. Powell is left with no absolute answer as to whether prot was in fact an alien entity or just a coping mechanism of the traumatized Porter, but seems far from convinced that Porter's behavior was a delusion.\n\nIn a final voiceover, prot explains to Powell that the people of K-PAX have discovered that [[eternal return|our universe will repeat its events again and again]], so the mistakes we make will be repeated forever. prot encourages Powell to make this time count, as it is the only chance we have. Inspired, Powell begins a new, better life by reconciling with his estranged son Michael.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Kevin Spacey]] as prot/Robert Porter\n* [[Jeff Bridges]] as Dr. Mark Powell\n* [[Mary McCormack]] as Rachel Powell\n* [[Alfre Woodard]] as Dr. Claudia Villars\n* [[David Patrick Kelly]] as Howie\n* [[Saul Williams]] as Ernie\n* [[Peter Gerety]] as Sal\n* [[Celia Weston]] as Doris Archer\n* [[Ajay Naidu]] as Dr. Chakraborty\n* [[Tracy Vilar]] as Maria\n* Melanee Murray as Bess\n* John Toles-Bey as Russell\n* [[Kimberly Scott]] as Joyce Trexler\n* [[Conchata Ferrell]] as Betty McAllister\n* [[Vincent Laresca]] as Navarro\n* [[Brian Howe (actor)|Brian Howe]] as Dr. Steven Becker\n* [[Mary Mara]] as Abby\n* [[William Lucking]] as Sheriff\n* [[Norman Alden]] as Babbling Man\n* [[Aaron Paul]] as Michael Powell\n}}\n\n==Production==\n\n[[Will Smith]] was offered the role of prot/Robert Porter.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1576048/will-smith-snagged-i-am-legend-from-schwarzenegger-but-can-you-imagine-nicolas-cage-in-the-matrix/|title = Will Smith Snagged 'I Am Legend' from Schwarzenegger, but Can You Imagine Nicolas Cage in 'The Matrix'?|website = [[MTV]]}}</ref> Kevin Spacey was originally offered the role of Dr. Mark Powell, but instead landed on the role of Prot.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2001/10/18/talking-k-pax-with-kevin-spacey|title = Talking K-PAX with Kevin Spacey - IGN|date = October 18, 2001}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n''K-PAX'' received mixed reviews from critics.

The complaint was withdrawn because the trial stretched over time and Subiela lacked sufficient funds to continue the litigation.
