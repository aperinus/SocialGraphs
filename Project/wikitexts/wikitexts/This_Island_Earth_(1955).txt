Newman]] and [[Jack Arnold (director)|Jack Arnold]], starring [[Jeff Morrow]], [[Faith Domergue]] and [[Rex Reason]]. It is based on the [[This Island Earth (novel)|eponymous 1952 novel]] by [[Raymond F. Jones]], which was originally published in the magazine ''[[Thrilling Wonder Stories]]'' as three related novelettes: \"The Alien Machine\" in the June 1949 issue, \"The Shroud of Secrecy\" in December 1949, and \"The Greater Conflict\" in February 1950. Jones had taken his title from a line in [[Robert Graves]]' poem, \"Darien\" (\"It is a poet\u2019s privilege and fate/To fall enamoured of the one Muse/Who variously haunts this island earth\".) The film was released in 1955 as a [[double feature]] with ''[[Abbott and Costello Meet the Mummy]]''.\n\nUpon initial release, the film was praised by critics, who cited the special effects, well-written script, and the eye-popping [[Technicolor]] as being its major assets.<ref name=\"New York Times, June 11, 1955\">Thompson, Howard H.

Just before landing, the jet's engine fails, but he is saved from crashing by a mysterious green glow.\n\nAt the lab is an unusual substitute for the electronic [[capacitor|condenser]]s that he had ordered. Instead, he discovers instructions and parts to build a complex device called an \"[[interocitor]]\". Neither Meacham nor his assistant Joe Wilson have heard of such a device, but they immediately begin its construction. When they finish, a mysterious man named Exeter appears on the interocitor's screen and informs Meacham that he has passed a test. His ability to build the interocitor demonstrates that he is gifted enough to be part of Exeter's special research project.\n\nIntrigued, Meacham is picked up at the fog-shrouded airport by an unmanned, computer-controlled [[Douglas DC-3]] aircraft with no windows. Landing in a remote area of Georgia, he finds an international group of top atomic scientists already present, including an old flame, Dr. Ruth Adams. Cal is confused by Ruth's failure to recognize him and suspicious of Exeter, his assistant Brack, and other odd-looking men leading the project.\n\nCal and Ruth flee with a third scientist, Steve Carlson, but their car is attacked and Carlson is killed. When they take off in a [[Stinson 108]] single engine aircraft, Cal and Ruth watch as the research facility and all its inhabitants are incinerated. Their aircraft is then drawn up by a bright green beam into a [[flying saucer]]. Exeter explains that he and his men are from the planet Metaluna and are locked in a war with the Zagons. They defend against Zagon attacks with a planetary energy field, but are running out of [[uranium]] to keep it operational. They have enlisted humans in an effort to transmute lead into uranium, but time has now run out. Exeter takes both Earthers back to his world, sealing them in conditioning tubes to normalize the pressure differences between the planets.\n\nThey land safely on Metaluna, but the planet is under bombardment by Zagon spaceships guiding flaming meteors as weapons against them. The defensive \"ionization layer\" is failing, and the battle is entering its final stage. Metaluna's leader, the Monitor, reveals that the Metalunans intend to flee to Earth. He insists that Meacham and Adams be subjected to a Thought Transference Chamber to subjugate their free will. He further indicates this will be the fate of the rest of humanity after Metalunan relocation. Exeter believes that this is immoral and misguided.\n\nBefore the couple can be sent into the device, Exeter helps them escape. Exeter is badly injured by a Mutant guard while he, Cal, and Ruth flee from Metaluna in the saucer. The planet's ionization layer becomes totally ineffective as they leave. Under the constant Zagon bombardment, Metaluna begins heating up and turns into a lifeless \"radioactive sun\". The Mutant guard has also boarded the saucer and attacks Ruth, but dies as a result of the pressure barrier differences on the way to Earth.\n\nAs they enter Earth's atmosphere, Exeter sends Cal and Ruth away in their aircraft, declining to join them. Exeter is dying and the ship's energy is nearly depleted. The saucer flies out over the ocean, rapidly accelerates until it is enclosed in a fireball, and crashes into the water, and explodes.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Jeff Morrow]] as Exeter\n* [[Faith Domergue]] as Ruth Adams\n* [[Rex Reason]] as Cal Meacham\n* [[Lance Fuller]] as Brack\n* [[Russell Johnson]] as Steve Carlson\n* Douglas Spencer as The Monitor\n* [[Robert Nichols (actor)|Robert Nichols]] as Joe Wilson\n* [[Orangey]] as Neutron the cat\n\n==Production==\nPrincipal photography for ''This Island Earth'' took place from January 30 to March 22, 1954.

Retrieved: October 30, 2014.</ref> Most of the Metaluna sequence was directed by Jack Arnold; the front office was apparently dissatisfied with the footage Newman shot and had it redone by Arnold, who unlike Newman had several sci-fiction films to his credit.\n\nMost of the sound effects, the ship, the interociter, etc. are simply recordings of [[radio teletype]] transmissions picked up on a short-wave radio played at various speeds. In a magazine article, the special effects department admitted that the \"mutant\" costume originally had legs that matched the upper body, but they had so much trouble making the legs look and work properly that they were forced by studio deadline to simply have the mutant wear a pair of trousers. Posters of the movie show the mutant as it was supposed to appear.\n\nThis title was one of the very few \"flat widescreen\" titles to be printed direct-to-matrix by Technicolor. This specially ordered 35-millimeter printing process was intended to maintain the highest possible print quality, as well as to protect the negative. Another film that was also given the direct-to-matrix treatment was ''[[Written on the Wind]]'', which was also a Universal-International film.\n\n==Reception==\n===Box-office===\n''This Island Earth'' was released in June 1955,<ref name=\"Warren\">Warren 1982, pp. 228\u2013234; 444.</ref> and by the end of that year had accrued US$1,700,000 in distributors' domestic (United States and Canada) rentals, making it the year's 74th biggest earner.<ref name=\"Gebert\">Geber 1996.</ref>{{#tag:ref|\"Rentals\" refers to the distributor/studio's share of the box office gross, which, according to Gebert, is roughly half of the money generated by ticket sales.|group=N}}\n\n===Critical response===\nA review in ''[[The New York Times]]'' by [[Howard Thompson (film critic)|Howard Thompson]] stated: \"The technical effects of ''This Island Earth'', Universal's first science-fiction excursion in color, are so superlatively bizarre and beautiful that some serious shortcomings can be excused, if not overlooked.\"<ref name=\"New York Times, June 11, 1955\"/> \"Whit\" in ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' wrote: \"Special effects of the most realistic type rival the story and characterizations in capturing the interest in this exciting science-fiction chiller, one of the most imaginative, fantastic and {{Sic|?|hide=y|cleverly|-}}conceived entries to date in the outer-space film field.\"<ref name=\"Whit\"/> Philip K.

The dialogue\u2014especially in the faked-up romance between Doctors Meacham and Adams\u2014remains resolutely earth-bound, while the ending is simply a spacial variation on the conventional curtain.
