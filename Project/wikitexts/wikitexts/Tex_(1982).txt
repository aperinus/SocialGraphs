Haas]]. It is based on the [[Tex (novel)|novel of the same name]] by [[S. E. Hinton]]. [[Matt Dillon]] and [[Jim Metzler]] play brothers who struggle after their mother dies and their father walks out on them.\n\n''Tex'' is seen as one of the earliest efforts for Disney to put mature content in its movies and received positive reviews for its realism and its content.\n\n== Premise ==\nA coming-of-age adventure about two brothers, Tex and Mason McCormick, struggling to make it on their own when their mother dies and their father leaves them in their Oklahoma home.\nFifteen-year-old Tex McCormick and his 17-year-old brother Mason are trying to make it on their own in the absence of their rodeo-riding father. Mason takes over running the household and, to make ends meet, sells Tex\u2019s beloved horse, Rowdy. Tex gets mad at Mason and heedlessly tumbles into scrape after scrape. When his Pop comes home, Tex is shocked to learn that he isn\u2019t his real father. But Tex realizes that Mason and Pop do love him, and it is time to start growing up.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Matt Dillon]] as Texas \"Tex\" McCormick\n* [[Jim Metzler]] as Mason \"Mace\" McCormick\n* [[Meg Tilly]] as Jamie Collins\n* [[Bill McKinney]] as Pop McCormick\n* [[Frances Lee McCain]] as Mrs. Johnson\n* [[Ben Johnson (actor)|Ben Johnson]] as Cole Collins\n* Phil Brock as Lem Peters\n* [[Emilio Estevez]] as Johnny Collins\n* [[Tom Virtue]] as Robert Bob Collins\n* Jack Thibeau as Coach Jackson\n* [[\u017deljko Ivanek]] as Hitchhiker Mark Jennings\n* Pamela Ludwig as Connie Peters\n* [[S.E. Hinton]] as Mrs. Barnes\n\n== Production ==\nThe film was [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system|rated]] \"PG\" rather than the \"G\" then customarily earned by [[Walt Disney Studios (division)|Walt Disney Studios]] productions, and was  noted as an early effort by Disney to incorporate more mature subject matter into its films.  The film was somewhat edgy for Disney at the time for its scenes that depicted [[marijuana]] use as well as featuring a moderate amount of profanity. Tim Hunter, who had previously co-written the 1979 film ''[[Over the Edge (film)|Over the Edge]]'' with Charles Haas, brought the project to Disney and asked for the opportunity to direct it himself.  The film was shot entirely on location in and around [[Tulsa, Oklahoma]] and its suburbs,<ref>Stephen Farber, [https://www.nytimes.com/1982/10/10/movies/oddball-who-brought-tex-disney-stephen-farber-freelance-writer-based-los-angeles.html \"The 'Oddball' Who Brought 'Tex' to Disney\"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', October 10, 1982.</ref>  the setting of the S.
