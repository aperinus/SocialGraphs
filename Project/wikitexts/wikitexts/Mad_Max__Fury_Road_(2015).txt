Miller collaborated with [[Brendan McCarthy]] and [[Nico Lathouris]] on the screenplay. The fourth {{not a typo|instalment}} and a [[Reboot (fiction)|reboot]]<ref name=\"Filming1\" /> of the ''[[Mad Max]]''  franchise, it was produced by [[Village Roadshow Pictures]], [[Kennedy Miller Mitchell]], and [[RatPac-Dune Entertainment]] and distributed by [[Roadshow Entertainment]] in Australia and by [[Warner Bros. Pictures]] internationally. The film stars [[Tom Hardy]] and [[Charlize Theron]], with [[Nicholas Hoult]], [[Hugh Keays-Byrne]], [[Rosie Huntington-Whiteley]], [[Riley Keough]], [[Zo\u00eb Kravitz]], [[Abbey Lee]], and [[Courtney Eaton]] in supporting roles. Set in a post-apocalyptic desert wasteland where petrol and water are scarce commodities, ''Fury Road'' follows [[Max Rockatansky]], who joins forces with [[Imperator Furiosa]] against cult leader [[Immortan Joe]] and his army, leading to a lengthy road battle.\n\nMiller came up with the idea for ''Fury Road'' in 1987, but the film spent many years in [[development hell]] before [[pre-production]] started in 1998. Attempts to shoot the film in the 2000s were delayed numerous times due to the [[September 11 attacks]], the [[Iraq War]], and controversies surrounding star [[Mel Gibson]], leading Miller to recast Gibson\u2019s role of Max Rockatansky. Miller decided to pursue the film again in 2007, after the release of the [[Animation|animated]] comedy ''[[Happy Feet]]''. In 2009, Miller announced that filming would begin in early 2011. Hardy was cast as Max in June 2010, with production planned to begin that November. [[Principal photography]] was delayed several more times before it actually began in July 2012. The film [[Wrap (filmmaking)|wrapped]] in December 2012, although [[Pick-up (filmmaking)|additional footage]] was shot in November 2013.\n\n''Fury Road'' premiered in Los Angeles on 7 May 2015, and was released in Australia on 14 May. It grossed $375.7 million at the worldwide box office, making it the highest-grossing ''[[Mad Max]]'' film, but is estimated to have incurred overall losses of $20\u201340 million when all of the advertising and other costs are added to its $154.6\u2013185.1 million production budget.<ref name=\"McClintock\" /> The film was praised by critics for its direction, writing, action sequences, musical score, technical aspects, and performances (particularly those of Hardy and Theron) and received numerous [[List of accolades received by Mad Max: Fury Road|accolades]]. At the [[88th Academy Awards]], it was nominated in ten categories, including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]] and [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]], and won in six, the most of any film at that year's ceremony: [[Academy Award for Best Film Editing|Best Film Editing]], [[Academy Award for Best Production Design|Best Production Design]], [[Academy Award for Best Costume Design|Best Costume Design]], [[Academy Award for Best Makeup and Hairstyling|Best Makeup and Hairstyling]], [[Academy Award for Best Sound Mixing|Best Sound Mixing]], and [[Academy Award for Best Sound Editing|Best Sound Editing]].

Please be selective with additions. -->\nWith the world a desert wasteland following societal collapse and warfare over resources, a survivor named [[Max <!-- Max's full name is stated in the film. Please consult the talk page before removing his surname -->Rockatansky]], who is haunted by memories of all the people he has failed to protect, is captured and taken to warlord [[Immortan Joe]]'s Citadel, where he is imprisoned and used as a \"blood bag\" for Nux, a sick War Boy. Meanwhile, [[Imperator Furiosa]], one of Joe's lieutenants, is sent in the armoured \"War Rig\" to trade [[produce]] for petrol and ammunition with two of Joe's allies. When Joe realises his five wives are fleeing in the Rig, he leads his army in pursuit of Furiosa, calling on the aid of Gas Town and the Bullet Farm. Nux joins the pursuit with Max strapped to his car, and a battle ensues. Furiosa drives into a [[sand storm]] and loses all of her pursuers, except Nux, who attempts to sacrifice himself to blow up the Rig. Max frees himself and restrains Nux, and Furiosa destroys their car.\n\nAfter the storm, Max finds Furiosa repairing the Rig, accompanied by Joe's wives: Toast, Capable, the Dag, Cheedo, and Angharad, the last of whom is heavily pregnant with Joe's child. Max tries to steal the Rig, but he does not know the code to bypass the kill switches, so he begrudgingly joins up with Furiosa and the wives. Nux boards the Rig as it leaves and attempts to kill Furiosa. He is overcome and thrown out, and Joe's army picks him up when they pass by. Furiosa drives through a canyon controlled by a [[biker gang]], having arranged to trade fuel for her safe passage, but the gang turns on her when they spot an army approaching, forcing her to flee. The bikers detonate the canyon walls to block Joe and then pursue the Rig, only stopping when the fuel pod explodes. Joe drives over the blockade in a [[monster truck]] and catches up with the Rig, allowing Nux to board and attack Furiosa again, but he trips before reaching the cab. While helping Max, Angharad falls off the Rig and is fatally run over by Joe, who temporarily halts his pursuit.\n\nCapable finds Nux hiding in the Rig and consoles him as he laments his failure. After dark, Furiosa and Max slow Joe's forces with mines set in swampland, but Joe's ally, the Bullet Farmer, continues to pursue. The Rig gets stuck, and Nux emerges from hiding to help free it, joining the crew. Furiosa blinds the approaching Bullet Farmer, and Max confronts him and returns with guns and ammunition. In the morning, Furiosa explains to Max that the \"Green Place\" to which they are escaping is an idyllic land she remembers from her childhood. She recognises a familiar landmark and shouts out her history and clan affiliation to a woman on top. The woman summons her all-female clan, the Vuvalini, who recognise Furiosa as one of their own who was kidnapped as a child. Furiosa is devastated to learn that the swampland from the previous night was the Green Place, which is now uninhabitable, and there are only seven Vuvalini left. The group, less Max, begins to ride across an immense [[Salt pan (geology)|salt flat]], hoping to find a new home. \n\nAfter seeing a vision of a child he failed to save,<ref>''Mad Max: Fury Road: Max Comic'' (vol. 1) #1</ref><ref>''Mad Max: Fury Road: Max Comic'' (vol. 1) #2</ref> Max catches up and convinces the others to return the way they came and take the undefended Citadel, which has ample water and crops. They meet Joe's forces and engage in battle. Five Vuvalini and many members of Joe's forces are killed, and Toast is captured. As they approach the canyon, Joe gets in front of the Rig to slow it. While Max fights Joe's large adult son, Rictus Erectus, Furiosa, though seriously wounded, goes to save Toast and kills Joe. The surviving brides and Vuvalini cross over to Joe's vehicle, and Nux sacrifices himself by wrecking the Rig to block the canyon. Max [[Blood transfusion|transfuses]] his blood to Furiosa, saving her life. Back at the Citadel, the people rejoice upon learning of Joe's death and tear his corpse to pieces. As Max's companions are lifted in triumph to Joe's cliffside fortress, Max exchanges a glance with Furiosa and disappears into the crowd.\n\n== Cast ==\n[[File:Cannes 2015 13.jpg|thumb|Cast and crew attending the premiere of the film at the [[2015 Cannes Film Festival]]]]\n<!-- in the same order as the film's credits -->\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Tom Hardy]] as [[Max Rockatansky|\"Mad\" Max Rockatansky]]\n* [[Charlize Theron]] as [[Imperator Furiosa]]\n* [[Nicholas Hoult]] as Nux\n* [[Hugh Keays-Byrne]] as [[Immortan Joe]]\n* [[Josh Helman]] as Slit, Nux's lancer\n* [[Nathan Jones (wrestler)|Nathan Jones]] as Rictus Erectus, Joe's large, muscular, [[low IQ]] son\n* [[Zo\u00eb Kravitz]] as Toast the Knowing, the wife with short hair\n* [[Rosie Huntington-Whiteley]] as The Splendid Angharad, the wife with dirty blonde hair\n* [[Riley Keough]] as Capable, the wife with red hair\n* [[Abbey Lee Kershaw|Abbey Lee]] as The Dag, the wife with platinum blonde hair\n* [[Courtney Eaton]] as Cheedo the Fragile, the wife with black hair\n* [[John Howard (Australian actor)|John Howard]] as The People Eater, who rules Gas Town\n* [[Richard Carter (actor)|Richard Carter]] as The Bullet Farmer, who rules the Bullet Farm\n* [[Iota (singer)|iOTA]] as The Doof Warrior (Coma), the guitarist who travels with Joe's war convoy\n* [[Angus Sampson]] as The Organic Mechanic, a doctor who works for Joe\n* [[Jennifer Hagan]] as Miss Giddy, the caretaker of Joe's wives\n* [[Megan Gale]] as The Valkyrie, the youngest of the Vuvalini\n* [[Melissa Jaffer]] as Keeper of the Seeds, one of the Vuvalini\n* Melita Jurisic, [[Gillian Jones]], [[Joy Smithers]], Antoinette Kellerman, and Christina Koch as The Vuvalini\n* Jon Iles as The Ace, head of security on the War Rig\n* [[Quentin Kenihan]] as Corpus Colossus, Joe's son, who has a physical disability (likely [[osteogenesis imperfecta]], which Kenihan had) that stunted his growth and prevents him from being able to walk\n* Coco Jack Gillies as Glory the Child, the young girl in Max's flashbacks\n* Chris Patton as Morsov\n* Stephen Dunlevy as The Rock Rider Chief and The Winchman\n* [[Richard Norton (actor)|Richard Norton]] as The Prime Imperator\n}}\n\n== Production ==\n=== Development ===\n''Mad Max: Fury Road'' had a [[Development hell|lengthy gestation period]]. In 1987, [[George Miller (filmmaker)|George Miller]] had the idea of making a ''[[Mad Max]]'' movie that was \"almost a continuous chase\".{{Sfn|Martin|2003|p = 7}} He got an idea for the plot in 1998 when he was walking across a street in Los Angeles, and about a year later, while travelling from Los Angeles to Australia, a story in which \"violent marauders were fighting, not for oil or for material goods, but for human beings\" coalesced.{{Citation needed|date=September 2022}} Miller said he worked with five [[storyboard artist]]s to design the film in [[storyboard]] form before writing the screenplay, producing about 3,500 panels, which is almost the same as the number of shots as in the finished film, as he wanted the film to be almost a continuous chase, with relatively little dialogue, and to have the visuals come first.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://collider.com/mad-max-fury-road-george-miller-interview/ |title=Writer/Director George Miller Talks Mad Max: Fury Road,
