It stars [[Liv Tyler]], [[Pruitt Taylor Vince]], [[Shelley Winters]], and [[Debbie Harry|Deborah Harry]]. The plot focuses on an unhappy overweight cook (Vince) whose life is changed after an enchanting college drop-out (Tyler) begins working as a waitress at his and his mother's roadside tavern. The film explores themes of [[loneliness]], false hope, [[unrequited love]], and [[self-esteem|self-worth]].\n\nMangold wrote the screenplay for ''Heavy'' while attending filmmaking seminars at [[Columbia University]], and partly based it on real people he knew while growing up in [[upstate New York]]. Filming took place on location in and around [[Barryville, New York|Barryville]] and [[Hyde Park, New York]] in 1993; some scenes were filmed at the [[Culinary Institute of America]]'s [[Hyde Park campus of the Culinary Institute of America|campus there]].{{efn|The Culinary Institute is featured throughout the film, identified by its sign in front of the building; interior locations are also used.}} The film features an original soundtrack by [[Thurston Moore]], as well as songs by [[Evan Dando]] of [[The Lemonheads]], who also has a minor role in the film.\n\n''Heavy'' premiered at the [[Sundance Film Festival]] where it won the Special Jury Prize and was later screened at [[Cannes Film Festival|Cannes]] where it competed for the [[Cam\u00e9ra d'Or]]. The film received a theatrical release in the United Kingdom on December 29, 1995, and later had a [[limited release]] in the United States on June 5, 1996.\n\n==Plot==\nIn rural [[upstate New York]], thirty-something-year-old Victor Modino works as a cook at Pete and Dolly's, a small [[Roadhouse (facility)|roadhouse]] founded by and named after his now-deceased father and elderly mother. Dolly, who is in poor health, spends her days sitting in a chair in the back of the kitchen, reminiscing about her late husband Pete and antagonizing Delores, a cynical longtime employee who once had an affair with him. The daily rhythm of the restaurant is disrupted when Dolly hires a new waitress, Callie, a soft-spoken young woman who has just dropped out of college in [[Syracuse, New York|Syracuse]]. Callie immediately catches the eye of the painfully shy, [[overweight]] Victor. Delores takes Dolly's hiring of the beautiful but inexperienced Callie as a personal slight to herself, and treats Callie coldly.\n\nDuring working hours, Callie is impervious to Victor's debilitating shyness and attempts to get to know him better. Impressed by Victor's cooking skills, Callie suggests he attend the nearby [[Culinary Institute of America]], which is considered by Victor but swiftly dismissed by both Dolly and Delores. Victor quickly becomes enamored of Callie, and begins dieting and subtly trying to gain her attention, despite learning she has a steady boyfriend.\n\nDolly suffers a [[heart attack]] and is hospitalized. Victor tells Delores and Callie that Dolly is having minor surgery. Several days later, Dolly dies while Victor is eating lunch in the hospital cafeteria. The grieving Victor does not tell anyone of her death, but runs the restaurant as usual and deals with his grief by [[binge eating]]. Delores soon becomes suspicious about Dolly's extended absence, and also makes sexual advances towards Victor, which he rejects.\n\nOne night at the restaurant, Callie argues with her boyfriend Jeff and then in her anger tells off Delores in front of the customers. Delores' alcoholic friend Leo later assaults Victor for not taking Delores' side. Callie is left stranded at the restaurant and Victor drives her home, stopping en route so they can watch airplanes descend at an airfield. As they watch the airplanes, Callie becomes emotional over her lack of direction in life, and she and Victor end up kissing, but Callie quickly ends the encounter.\n\nCallie asks Victor to take her to visit Dolly in the hospital, and unable to confess that Dolly is dead, he agrees. The next morning, Callie arrives at Victor's house to accompany him to the hospital, but instead Victor drives her to the local cemetery and shows her Dolly's fresh grave. Callie becomes hysterical, and later fails to turn up for her restaurant shifts. Leo and Delores find out via a hospital employee that Dolly died weeks ago, and berate Victor for not telling them, then depart together, leaving Victor alone in the restaurant. In his rage and grief, Victor smashes items behind the counter. Later that evening, Callie arrives with Jeff to tell Victor she's quitting and to collect her final paycheck. She spends a few minutes alone with Victor, explaining that she plans to go back to college, but promising to come back and visit him sometime.\n\nIn the final scenes, Victor begins to emerge from his grief over Dolly's death. He stops binge eating, starts cleaning up the kitchen which he has neglected, and even musters the confidence to chat with Darlene, an attractive cashier at the local grocery market, who also shows an interest in him.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Pruitt Taylor Vince]] as Victor Modino\n* [[Shelley Winters]] as Dolly Modino\n* [[Liv Tyler]] as Callie\n* [[Debbie Harry|Deborah Harry]] as Delores\n* [[Joe Grifasi]] as Leo\n* [[Evan Dando]] as Jeff\n* [[David Patrick Kelly]] as Grey Man in the Hospital\n* Marian Quinn as Darlene\n* Meg Hartig as Donna\n* Zandy Hartig as Jean\n* Peter Ortel as Tony\n* [[J.

According to Mangold, who grew up in the [[Hudson River Valley]], he was inspired by a real-life classmate of his who was overweight, and whose mother owned a local diner; like in the film, the father had died, leaving the mother and son to run the restaurant themselves.{{sfn|Mangold|1999|loc=3:45\u20135:20}} In directing his first feature, Mangold aspired to make a film stripped of \"a certain Hollywood aesthetic,\"{{sfn|Levy|1999|p=302}} that followed a character who seemed a \"most unlikely centerpiece of a motion picture.\"{{sfn|Mangold|1999|loc=2:00}}\n\nMangold wrote the script for the film in 1991, while attending filmmaking seminars at [[Columbia University]] under the instruction of director [[Milo\u0161 Forman]].<ref name=\"sfgate2\">{{cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/e/a/1996/07/12/WEEKEND2814.dtl|work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]|date=July 12, 1996|access-date=March 22, 2010|author=Shulgasser, Barbara|title='Heavy' carries itself with rare subtlety}}</ref> In making the movie, Mangold was very focused on expression versus dialogue, especially in the character of Victor; Mangold stated that he was striving to create a \"[[silent film]], with sound.\"<ref name=\"sfgate2\" /> [[Peter Bogdanovich]]'s ''[[The Last Picture Show]]'' (1971) and [[Martin Ritt]]'s ''[[Hud (1963 film)|Hud]]'' (1963) served as specific influences.{{sfn|Mangold|1999|loc=7:58}}\n\n===Casting===\nMangold met Liv Tyler when she was sixteen years old; Tyler had little to no acting history, but expressed great interest in it.{{sfn|Mangold|1999|loc=13:28}} She had been doing [[model (person)|modeling]] work at the time, and was cast in the film \"without hesitation\" after a brief video audition with Mangold.{{sfn|Mangold|1999|loc=13:55}}  Through Tyler, Mangold got in touch with Deborah Harry, who was well-acquainted with young Tyler through the \"rock and roll\" scene in New York (Tyler being the daughter of [[Aerosmith]] front-man [[Steven Tyler]]); this resulted in Harry's casting as the part of the weathered, back-mouthing Delores. Evan Dando of [[The Lemonheads]] was cast as Tyler's guitarist boyfriend because of Mangold's admiration for his music, and in hope of bringing some star attention to the low-budget production.{{sfn|Mangold|1999|loc=13:40}}\n\n[[Pixies (band)|Pixies]] frontman [[Black Francis]] was originally meant to be cast as the role of Victor, but did not feel it was right for a debut acting role.\n\nIn casting the part of Dolly, Mangold sought [[Classical Hollywood cinema|golden age Hollywood]] actress Shelley Winters, who was in her mid-70s at the time. Mangold tracked down her address to her Manhattan apartment, and sent her the film's script along with a letter stating his admiration of her work. Within two days, Winters returned Mangold's contact and was subsequently cast.{{sfn|Mangold|1999|loc=15:10\u201317:25}}\n\nThe last person to be cast was Pruitt Taylor Vince, as Mangold had been having trouble finding an actor to portray the \"centerpiece\" character.{{sfn|Mangold|1999|loc=20:03}} An associate producer/friend of Mangold, who had been shooting ''[[Nobody's Fool (1994 film)|Nobody's Fool]]'' (1994) with Vince alongside [[Paul Newman]], suggested him.{{sfn|Mangold|1999|loc=21:00}} After Vince was cast, Mangold and the crew began feeding Vince doughnuts and [[Kentucky Fried Chicken]] in order for the actor, who was not remarkably overweight at the time, to rapidly gain weight before filming commenced.{{sfn|Mangold|1999|loc=21:10\u201322:30}}\n\n==Release==\n''Heavy'' premiered in January 1995 at the [[Sundance Film Festival]], where Mangold won the Special Jury Prize for directing.<ref name=cowan/> It subsequently screened at the [[Cannes Film Festival]] Directors Fortnight, where it was nominated for the [[Cam\u00e9ra d'Or]] award.<ref name=rookies>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/1995/film/features/rookies-reign-in-fortnight-99127300/|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|title=Rookies reign in Fortnight|date=May 1, 1995|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150418130113/https://variety.com/1995/film/features/rookies-reign-in-fortnight-99127300/|archive-date=April 18, 2015|author=''Variety'' Staff}}</ref>\n\nThe film's distributor, [[Cin\u00e9pix Film Properties]], released the film theatrically in the United States after Tyler had received recognition for her starring role in [[Bernardo Bertolucci]]'s ''[[Stealing Beauty]]'' (1996).<ref name=\"sfgate\">{{cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/1996/07/12/DD44304.DTL|work=[[San Francisco Gate]]|date=July 12, 1996|access-date=March 23, 2010|title='Heavy's' Light Take on Life / Liv Tyler makes sparks fly for lonely pizza chef|author=Guthmann, Edward}}</ref> Cin\u00e9pix released ''Heavy'' in the United States in the summer of 1996, premiering it in New York City on June 5, before it opened in [[Los Angeles]] on June 28.<ref name=afi>{{cite web|url=https://catalog.afi.com/Film/60433-HEAVY?sid=11097b80-7016-4fb0-b7c2-d44a11578402&sr=3.211916&cp=1&pos=2|work=[[AFI Catalog of Feature Films]]|title=''Heavy'' (1995)|location=Los Angeles, California|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190407221447/https://catalog.afi.com/Film/60433-HEAVY?sid=11097b80-7016-4fb0-b7c2-d44a11578402&sr=3.211916&cp=1&pos=2|publisher=[[American Film Institute]]|archive-date=April 7, 2019}}</ref> The release was [[limited release|limited]], expanding only to twenty-two screens nationwide.<ref name=\"mojo\" /> The film concluded its domestic theatrical run on November 28, 1996.<ref name=mojo/>\n\n===Critical response===\nFollowing the film's success at Sundance, it garnered generally positive reviews.

But presenting Victor as an exemplary sufferer\u2013a wounded soul trapped in the body of a lovelorn pizza cook, with [[Farrah Fawcett]] posters in his bedroom\u2013makes him a little ridiculous, without quite making him funny.
