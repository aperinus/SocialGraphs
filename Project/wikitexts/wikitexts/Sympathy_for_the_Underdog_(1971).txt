After serving ten years in prison, Gunji reunites with the few men still loyal to him and sets out to rebuild his old organization. However, after setting up a lucrative bootlegging operation in [[Okinawa]], the yakuza family from Tokyo that was responsible for their previous downfall and Gunji's imprisonment comes to the island planning to seize control of the territory. Gunji and his men are soon forced to engage in an epic battle for their lives.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[K\u014dji Tsuruta]] as Masuo Gunji\n*[[Noboru Ando]] as Noburo Kudo\n*[[Asao Koike]] as Ozaki\n*[[Hideo Murota]] as Shark\n*[[Harumi Sone]] as Gunshot\n*[[Tsunehiko Watase]] as Susumu Seki\n*[[Toru Yuri]] as Old Man\n*[[Asao Uchida]] as Eisaku Oba\n*Tadao Nakamura as Shigeru Kaizu\n*[[Kaku Takashina]] as Kusakabe\n*[[Rinishi Yamamoto]] as Hadelma\n*[[Tomisaburo Wakayama]] as Yonabal\n*[[Kenji Imai (actor)|Kenji Imai]] as Mad Dog Jiro\n*[[Kenjiro Morokado]] as Gushken\n*[[Akiko Kudo]] as Terumi\n\n==Production==\nThis is the ninth<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=i_QBAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA239|title=Outlaw Masters of Japanese Film|first=D.|last=Chris|date=May 27, 2005|publisher=I.B.Tauris|isbn=9780857715470|via=Google Books}}</ref> film in the ''Bakuto'' (''Gambler'') series of films that was produced by Toei Studios and starred Koji Tsuruta (except for the film ''Gambler Clan'', which starred [[Ken Takakura]] in his place).<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R66BgDYC07IC&pg=PA238|title=Outlaw Masters of Japanese Film|first=D.|last=Chris|date=May 27, 2005|publisher=Bloomsbury Academic|isbn=9781845110901|via=Google Books}}</ref> Fukasaku had previously directed ''Bakuto kaisanshiki'' (''[[Gambler's Farewell]]''), the sixth film in the series.\n\nSet and filmed in [[Okinawa]], ''Sympathy for the Underdog'' has similarities to actual real-life events. It was not until several months after the film was released that America gave control of Okinawa back to the Japanese. But yakuza fled to the prefecture in the late 1960s in anticipation of the new business opportunities created once US forces withdrew. This ultimately led to the [[Yamaguchi-gumi]], the largest criminal organization in the country, leading a ten-year war in Okinawa against other gangs. However, this was only just starting when the film went into production.<ref name=\"booklet\">[[Patrick Macias|Macias, Patrick]], ''Sympathy for the Underdog'' DVD booklet, 2004, [[Home Vision Entertainment]].

It was then that, Yamane thinks, Fukasaku decided to make a film about \"foreigners\" and \"resistance groups\" within a yakuza film.<ref name=\"Yamane\">{{cite AV media | people=Yamane, Sadao | date=2004 | chapter=Interview with Sadao Yamane |title=Sympathy for the Underdog | medium=DVD  | publisher=Home Vision Entertainment}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|id=0066806|title=Sympathy for the Underdog}}\n* {{in lang|ja}} ''[http://www.jmdb.ne.jp/1971/cu000060.htm Sympathy for the Underdog]'' at the Japanese Movie Database\n\n{{Kinji Fukasaku}}\n\n[[Category:1971 films]]\n[[Category:1971 crime films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Kinji Fukasaku]]\n[[Category:Films set in Okinawa Prefecture]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Okinawa Prefecture]]\n[[Category:1970s Japanese-language films]]\n[[Category:Toei Company films]]\n[[Category:Yakuza films]]\n[[Category:1970s Japanese films]]"}]}}}}
