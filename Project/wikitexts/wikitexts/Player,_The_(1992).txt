Altman once stated that the film \"is a very mild satire,\" offending no one.<ref name=\"DVD\">DVD commentary on ''The Player''.</ref> The film received three nominations at the [[65th Academy Awards]]: [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]], [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Adapted Screenplay]] and [[Academy Award for Best Film Editing|Best Editing]]. The film also won two [[Golden Globe Award|Golden Globes]], [[Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture \u2013 Musical or Comedy|Best Motion Picture \u2013 Comedy or Musical]] and [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor \u2013 Motion Picture Musical or Comedy|Best Actor \u2013 Comedy or Musical]] for Robbins.\n\n==Plot==\nGriffin Mill is a [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] studio executive dating story editor Bonnie Sherow. He hears story pitches from [[screenwriter]]s and decides which have the potential to be made into films, green-lighting only 12 out of 50,000 submissions every year. His job is threatened when up-and-coming story executive Larry Levy begins working at the studio. Mill has also been receiving death threat postcards, assumed to be from a screenwriter whose pitch he rejected.\n\nMill surmises that the disgruntled writer is David Kahane, and Kahane's girlfriend June Gudmundsdottir tells him that Kahane is at the [[Rialto Theatre (South Pasadena, California)|Rialto Theater]] in [[Pasadena, California|Pasadena]], at a screening of ''[[Bicycle Thieves]]''. Mill pretends to recognize Kahane in the lobby, and offers him a scriptwriting deal, hoping this will stop the threats. The two go to a nearby bar where Kahane gets intoxicated and rebuffs Mill's offer, calling him a liar and continuing to goad him about his job security at the studio. In the bar's parking lot, the two men fight. Mill goes too far and drowns Kahane in a shallow pool of water while screaming, \u201cKeep it to yourself!\u201d Mill then stages the crime to make it look like a botched robbery.\n\nThe next day, after Mill is late for and distracted at a meeting, studio chief of security Walter Stuckel confronts him about the murder and says that the police know that he was the last one to see Kahane alive. At the end of their conversation Mill receives a fax from his stalker. Thus, Mill has killed the wrong man, and the stalker apparently knows this. Mill attends Kahane's funeral and gets into conversation with Gudmundsdottir. Detectives Avery and DeLongpre suspect Mill is guilty of murder.\n\nMill receives a postcard from the stalker suggesting that they meet at a hotel bar. While Mill is waiting, he is cornered by two screenwriters, Tom Oakley and Andy Sivella, who pitch ''Habeas Corpus'', a legal drama featuring no major stars and with a depressing ending. Because Mill is not alone, his stalker does not appear. After leaving the bar, Mill receives a fax in his car, advising him to look under his raincoat. He discovers a live rattlesnake in a box and, terrified, bludgeons it with his umbrella.\n\nMill tells Gudmundsdottir that his near-death experience made him realize he has feelings for her. Apprehensive that Larry Levy continues encroaching on his job, Mill invites the two writers to pitch ''Habeas Corpus'' to him, convincing Levy that the movie will be an [[Oscar bait|Oscar contender]]. Mill's plan is to let Levy shepherd the film through production and have it flop. Mill will step in at the last moment, suggesting some changes to salvage the film's box office, letting him reclaim his position at the studio. Having persuaded Sherow to leave for New York on studio business, Mill takes Gudmundsdottir to a Hollywood awards banquet and their relationship blossoms.\n\nAfter Sherow confronts Mill about his relationship with Gudmundsdottir, Mill coldly severs their relationship in front of two writers. Mill takes Gudmundsdottir to an isolated [[Desert Hot Springs, California|Desert Hot Springs]] resort and spa. In the middle of Mill and Gudmundsdottir making love, Mill confesses his role in Kahane's murder, and Gudmundsdottir responds by saying she loves him. Mill's attorney informs him that studio head Joel Levison has been fired, and that the Pasadena police want Mill to participate in a [[police lineup|lineup]]. An eyewitness has come forward, but she fails to identify Mill.\n\nOne year later, studio power players are watching the end of ''Habeas Corpus'' with a new, tacked-on, upbeat Hollywood ending and famous actors in the lead roles. Mill's plan to save the movie has worked and he is head of the studio. Gudmundsdottir is now Mill's wife and pregnant with his child. Sherow objects to the film's new ending and is fired by Levy. Mill rebuffs her when she appeals her termination to him. Mill receives a pitch over the phone from Levy and a man who reveals himself as the postcard writer. The man pitches an idea about a studio executive who kills a writer and gets away with murder. Impressed, Mill gives the writer a deal, if he can guarantee a happy ending in which the executive lives happily with the writer's widow. The writer's title for the film is ''The Player''.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Tim Robbins]] as Griffin Mill\n* [[Greta Scacchi]] as June Gudmundsdottir\n* [[Fred Ward]] as Walter Stuckel\n* [[Whoopi Goldberg]] as Detective Susan Avery\n* [[Peter Gallagher]] as Larry Levy\n* [[Brion James]] as Joel Levison\n* [[Cynthia Stevenson]] as Bonnie Sherow\n* [[Vincent D'Onofrio]] as David Kahane\n* [[Dean Stockwell]] as Andy Sivella\n* [[Richard E.

Altman continued to work outside the studios in the late 1970s and throughout the 1980s, often doing small budget projects or filmed plays to keep his career alive. [[Chevy Chase]] was interested in playing the role of Griffin Mill, but Warner Bros didn't want Chase to star in the film.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vulture.com/2011/09/the-lost-roles-of-chevy-chase.html|title=The Lost Roles of Chevy Chase|date=September 22, 2011}}</ref>\n\nAlthough it was distributed by [[Fine Line Features]] rather than a major studio (FLF was a division of [[New Line Cinema]]), ''The Player'' was Altman's comeback to making films in Hollywood.<ref name=\"Murray\">{{cite web |last=Murray |first=Noel |title=Vincent & Theo |date=March 30, 2015 |work=[[The Dissolve]] |url=http://thedissolve.com/reviews/1475-vincent-theo/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160407084439/http://thedissolve.com/reviews/1475-vincent-theo/ |archive-date=2016-04-07 |url-status=live |quote=When ''The Player'' came out in 1992, it was greeted as a welcome comeback for director Robert Altman, who spent much of the previous decade working small\u2014making filmed plays instead of the ambitious, character-heavy genre reinventions he\u2019d been known for in the 1970s. But Altman actually reclaimed his critics\u2019 darling status two years earlier with ''Vincent & Theo'', a luminous biopic about painter Vincent Van Gogh (played by Tim Roth) and his art-dealer brother (Paul Rhys).}}</ref> It ushered in a new period of filmmaking for him, and he continued on to an adaptation of [[Raymond Carver]]'s short stories, ''[[Short Cuts (film)|Short Cuts]]'' (1993).\n\n===Opening sequence shot===\nThe opening [[Long take|sequence shot]] lasts 7 minutes and 47 seconds without an edit.

Ma\u00e7ek III}}</ref> but, according to the slate at the beginning of the shot, the tenth take was used in the final edit.\n\n===Intimate scene===\nAltman was praised for the sex scene in which Robbins and Scacchi were filmed from the neck up. Scacchi later claimed that Altman had wanted a [[nude scene]], but that it was her refusal which led to the final form.<ref>{{cite news|title=Greta Scacchi: 'I'm done with taking off my clothes on screen'|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/starsandstories/3557111/Greta-Scacchi-Im-done-with-taking-off-my-clothes-on-screen.html|access-date=14 October 2012|newspaper=Daily Telegraph|date=25 July 2008}}</ref>\n\n===Editing===\nThe editing of ''The Player'' by Geraldine Peroni was honored by a nomination for the [[Academy Award for Best Film Editing]]. In 2004, [[Anthony Sloman|Tony Sloman]] wrote an appreciation of the film's editing:<ref name=\"independent\">{{Cite news |last=Sloman |first=Tony |title=Geraldine Peroni Obituary: Oscar-nominated film editor on 'The Player' |work=[[The Independent]] |date=August 31, 2004 |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/geraldine-peroni-550379.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160108105910/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/geraldine-peroni-550379.html |archive-date=January 8, 2016 |access-date=September 16, 2017 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}</ref>{{blockquote|''The Player'' is a marvellous example of collaborative editing, Peroni matching Altman's tone with exactitude. Early on, a cut from a zoom-in to the gun in Humphrey Bogart's hand on a postcard sent to Tim Robbins is perfectly successively matched with what appears to be a black frame, in which a reveal shows that it's an open drawer in which the postcard has been placed. Another felicitous sequence is the one in the Pasadena police station, where the Robbins character is arraigned as Lyle Lovett swats a fly and Whoopi Goldberg and her associates ridicule Robbins with laughter. This is beautifully edited; well-shot, too, but the rhythm is built in the cutting.}}\n\n==Reception==\nOn [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film has an approval rating of 98% based on 65 reviews, with an average rating of 8.80/10.
