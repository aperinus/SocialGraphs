The film is about a \"[[grassroots]]\" political campaign created unwittingly by a newspaper columnist with the involvement of a hired homeless man and pursued by the paper's wealthy owner.<ref name=\"Filmsite\">Dirks, Tim.

Retrieved: March 13, 2015.</ref> It became a box-office hit and was nominated for an [[Academy Award for Best Story]]. It was ranked No. 49 in [[AFI's 100 Years ... 100 Cheers]]. In 1969, the film entered the [[List of films in the public domain in the United States|public domain in the United States]] because the claimants did not renew its [[copyright registration]] in the 28th year after publication.<ref>Pierce, David. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/25165419 \"Forgotten faces: Why some of our cinema heritage is part of the public domain.\"] ''Film History'', Vol. 19, No. 2, 2007, pp. 125\u2013143.</ref> It was the first of two features Capra made for [[Warner Brothers]], after he left [[Columbia Pictures]], the other being ''[[Arsenic and Old Lace (film)|Arsenic and Old Lace]]'' (1944).\n\n==Plot==\nA local newspaper, ''The Bulletin'', is under new management, with columnist Ann Mitchell being one of the staffers dismissed to \"streamline\" the paper, but not before being told to write one final column. Infuriated, Ann prints a letter from a fictional unemployed \"[[John Doe]]\" threatening suicide on Christmas Eve in protest of society's ills. When the letter causes a sensation among readers, and the paper's competition, ''The Chronicle'', suspects a fraud and starts to investigate, editor Henry Connell is persuaded to rehire Ann, who schemes to boost the newspaper's sales by exploiting the fictional John Doe. From a number of derelicts who show up at the paper claiming to have written the original letter, Ann and Henry hire John Willoughby, a former baseball player and tramp in need of money to repair his injured arm, to play the role of John Doe. Ann starts to pen a series of articles in Doe's name, elaborating on the original letter's ideas of society's disregard for people in need.\n\nWilloughby gets $50, a new suit of clothes, and a plush hotel suite with his tramp friend \"The Colonel\", who launches into an extended diatribe against \"the heelots\", many heels who incessantly focus on getting money from others. Proposing to take Doe nationwide via the radio, Ann is given $100 a week by the ''Bulletin''<nowiki/>'s publisher, D. B. Norton, to write radio speeches for Willoughby. Meanwhile, John is offered a $5,000 [[bribery|bribe]] from the ''Chronicle'' to admit the whole thing was a [[publicity stunt]], but ultimately turns it down and delivers the speech Ann has written for him instead. Afterward, feeling conflicted, he runs away, riding the rails with the Colonel until they reach Millsville. \"John Doe\" is recognized at a diner and brought to City Hall, where he's met by Bert Hanson, who explains how he was inspired by Doe's words to start a \"John Doe club\" with his neighbors.\n\nThe John Doe philosophy spreads across the country, developing into a broad grassroots movement whose simple slogan is, \"Be a better neighbor\". However, Norton secretly plans to channel support for Doe into support for his own national political ambitions. When a John Doe rally is scheduled, with John Doe clubs from throughout the country in attendance, Norton instructs Mitchell to write a speech for Willoughby in which he announces the foundation of a new political party and endorses Norton as its presidential candidate. On the night of the rally, John, who has come to believe in the John Doe philosophy himself, learns of Norton's treachery from a drunken Henry. He denounces Norton and tries to expose the plot at the rally, but his speech is interrupted by hordes of newsboys carrying a special edition of the ''Bulletin'' exposing Doe as a fake. Norton claims Doe had deceived him and the staff of the newspaper, like everyone else, and cuts off the loudspeakers before Doe could defend himself. Despondent at letting his now-angry followers down, John plans to commit suicide by jumping from the roof of the City Hall on [[Christmas Eve]], as indicated in the original John Doe letter. Ann, who has fallen in love with John, desperately tries to talk him out of jumping (saying that [[Jesus Christ|the first John Doe]] has already died for the sake of humanity), and Hanson and his neighbours tell him of their plan to restart their John Doe club. Convinced not to kill himself, John leaves, carrying a fainted Ann in his arms, and Henry turns to Norton and says, \"There you are, Norton! The people! Try and lick that!\"\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Gary Cooper]] as [[John Doe]] / Long John Willoughby\n* [[Barbara Stanwyck]] as Ann Mitchell\n* [[Edward Arnold (actor)|Edward Arnold]] as D.B.

The screenplay was derived from a 1939 [[film treatment]], titled \"The Life and Death of John Doe\", written by Richard Connell and Robert Presnell who would go on to be the recipients of the film's sole [[Academy Award]] nomination for Best Original Story. The treatment was based upon Connell's 1922 ''Century Magazine'' story titled \"A Reputation\".<ref name=\"Filmsite\"/>\n\nGary Cooper was always Frank Capra's first choice to play John Doe. Cooper had agreed to the part without reading a script for two reasons: he had enjoyed working with Capra on their earlier collaboration, ''[[Mr. Deeds Goes to Town]]'' (1936), and he wanted to work with Barbara Stanwyck. The role of the hardbitten news reporter, however, was initially offered to [[Ann Sheridan]],  but the first choice for the role had been turned down by [[Warner Bros.]] due to a contract dispute, and [[Olivia de Havilland]] was similarly contacted, albeit unsuccessfully.<ref name=\"Filmsite\"/>\n\nThe composer selected was frequent Capra collaborator [[Dimitri Tiomkin]], who also did the scores for Capra's ''[[Lost Horizon (1937 film)|Lost Horizon]]''. ''[[Mr. Smith Goes to Washington]]'' and ''[[It's a Wonderful Life]]''. He later won two music Oscars for the non-Capra film ''[[High Noon]]''.\n\n==Reception==\n[[Bosley Crowther]], the film critic for ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote that John Willoughby was just the latest of the everyman that Frank Capra had portrayed in earlier films: \n{{blockquote|With an excellent script by Mr. Riskin\u2014overwritten in many spots, it is true\u2014Mr. Capra has produced a film which is eloquent with affection for gentle people, for the plain, unimpressive little people who want reassurance and faith. Many of his camera devices are magnificent in the scope of their suggestion, and always he tells his story well, with his customary expert spacing of comedy and serious drama. Only space prevents us from enthusing loudly about individual \"touches\".<ref>{{cite news| last= Crowther| first= Bosley| author-link= Bosley Crowther | url= https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9501EFDD1E38E33BBC4B52DFB566838A659EDE |title=Meet John Doe (1941); 'Meet John Doe,' an inspiring lesson in Americanism, opens at the Rivoli and Hollywood theatres| work=[[The New York Times]]| date= 13 March 1941}}</ref>}}\n\nIn the ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' review, there was a more critical look at the plot:\n{{blockquote|The synthetic fabric of the story is the weakness of the production, despite the magnificence of the Frank Capra-directed superstructure.
