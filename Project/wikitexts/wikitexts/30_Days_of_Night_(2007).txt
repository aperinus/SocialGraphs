The film was directed by [[David Slade]] and stars [[Josh Hartnett]] and [[Melissa George]]. The story focuses on an [[Alaska]]n town beset by vampires as it enters into a 30-day-long [[polar night]].\n\n''30 Days of Night'' was originally pitched as a comic, then as a film, but it was rejected. Years later, [[Steve Niles]] showed [[IDW Publishing]] the idea and it took off. The film was produced on a budget of $30 million and grossed over $75 million at the box office during its six-week run starting on October 19, 2007. Critical reviews were mixed. The film has since developed a [[cult following]].\n\nA [[sequel]], ''[[30 Days of Night: Dark Days|Dark Days]]'', was released on October 5, 2010, straight to home video. A [[prequel]] [[miniseries]], ''[[30 Days of Night: Blood Trails|Blood Trails]]'', was released on [[FEARnet|FEARnet.com and FEARnet On Demand]] in 2007. Another sequel miniseries, ''[[30 Days of Night: Dust to Dust|Dust to Dust]]'', placed chronologically before ''Dark Days'', was released in 2008.\n\n==Plot==\nThe town of [[Barrow, Alaska]], is preparing for its annual \"30 Days of Night\", a period during the winter with a month-long [[polar night]]. As the town gets ready, a stranger rows ashore from a large ship and sabotages the town's communications and transport to the outside world. Barrow's sheriff, Eben Oleson, investigates and also learns that his estranged wife, Stella, missed the last plane out of town and must stay the 30 days. That night, a band of [[vampire]]s, led by Marlow, attacks and slaughters<!-- band is singular --> most of the townspeople, forcing Eben, Stella, Eben's younger brother Jake, and several other survivors to take shelter in a boarded-up house with a hidden attic. Marlow finds the stranger, who believes the vampires are going to turn him into one of them as a reward for his help, locked up in the station. Marlow thanks him for doing what he asked, and then snaps his neck.\n\nEighteen days later, when a blizzard hits, the group uses the [[Whiteout (weather)|whiteout]] to go to the general store for supplies, but is stranded after it ends. While the group heads for the station, Eben creates a diversion by having the vampires chase him to his grandmother's house, where he uses one of her ultraviolet lights to burn the face of Marlow's lover, Iris, so badly that Marlow is forced to kill her. As he escapes, the town snowplow operator, Beau, creates another distraction with his tractor, killing many of the vampires, before trying to blow himself up; when he fails, Marlow crushes his head. Eben arrives at the station, where he is then forced to kill Carter, who was bitten and has become a vampire.\n\nOn Day 27, Stella and Eben see the deputy, Billy, signaling them with a flashlight, and bring him back to the station, after finding out he killed his family to save them from a more painful death. The trio find the others have made for the [[Utility tunnel|utilidor]], a power and sewage treatment station that still has power, and head over there, but are separated after Stella saves Gail Robbins, a young girl whose family was slaughtered by a vampire named Zurial, who was stalking her. Eben and Billy make it to the utilidor, but are attacked by the vampire Arvin, who bites Billy; Billy knocks Arvin into the heavy-duty shredder, and in doing so, grinds his own hand to a stump by accident, before being killed by Eben because he is starting to turn.\n\nAs the month comes to an end, with the sun due to rise, the vampires start to burn down the town to destroy evidence of their presence, including survivors. Realizing Stella is trapped and that he cannot beat the vampires in his current state, Eben turns himself into a vampire by injecting himself with Billy's infected blood. He confronts Marlow and they get into a vicious fight, before Marlow is finally killed by having a hole punched through his mouth and head, causing the remaining vampires to flee. Knowing he will die soon, Eben and Stella go off to watch the sunrise together, sharing one last kiss. As the sun comes up, Eben's body burns to ash in Stella's arms.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Josh Hartnett]] as Sheriff Eben Oleson\n* [[Melissa George]] as Stella Oleson\n* [[Danny Huston]] as Marlow\n* [[Ben Foster (actor)|Ben Foster]] as the Stranger\n* [[Mark Boone Junior]] as Beau Brower\n* [[Mark Rendall]] as Jake Oleson\n* [[Amber Sainsbury]] as Denise\n* [[Manu Bennett]] as Deputy Billy Kitka\n* Megan Franich as Iris\n* [[Joel Tobeck]] as Doug Hertz\n* [[Elizabeth Hawthorne]] as Lucy Ikos\n* [[Nathaniel Lees]] as Carter Davies\n* [[Craig Hall (actor)|Craig Hall]] as Wilson Bulosan\n* [[Chic Littlewood]] as Isaac Bulosan\n* Peter Feeney as John Riis\n* [[Andrew Stehlin]] as Arvin\n* [[John Rawls (actor)|John Rawls]] as Zurial\n* [[Jared Turner]] as Aaron\n* Kelson Henderson as Gabe\n* [[Pua Magasiva]] as Malekai Hamm\n* [[Grant Tilly]] as Gus\n* Rachel Maitland-Smith as Gail\n* [[Kate Elliott (actress)|Kate Elliott]] as Dawn\n* [[Jacob Tomuri]] as Seth\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n\n===Development===\n''30 Days of Night'' author [[Steve Niles]] conceived of the story in the form of a comic, but after meeting a lack of interest in initial pitches, tried to pitch it as a film.
