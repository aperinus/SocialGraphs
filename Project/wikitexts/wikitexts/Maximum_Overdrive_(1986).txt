The screenplay was inspired by and loosely based on King's short story \"[[Trucks (short story)|Trucks]]\", which was included in the author's first collection of short stories, ''[[Night Shift (book)|Night Shift]]'', and follows the events after all machines (including cars, trucks, radios, drones, arcades, vending machines, etc.) become sentient when Earth crosses the tail of a comet, initiating a world-wide killing spree.\n\nThe film is King's only directorial effort, though dozens of [[List of Stephen King films|films]] have been based on [[Stephen King bibliography|his novels or short stories]]. It contained [[black humor]] elements and a generally [[Camp (style)|campy]] tone, which contrasts with King's somber subject matter in books. The film has a mid-1980s [[hard rock]] soundtrack composed entirely by the group [[AC/DC]] (King's favorite band), whose album ''[[Who Made Who]]'' was released as the ''Maximum Overdrive'' soundtrack. It includes the best-selling [[single (music)|singles]] \"[[Who Made Who (song)|Who Made Who]]\", \"[[You Shook Me All Night Long]]\", and \"[[Hells Bells (song)|Hells Bells]]\".\n\n''Maximum Overdrive'' was theatrically released on July 25, 1986, to generally negative reviews from critics. It was nominated for two [[Golden Raspberry Awards]] including [[Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Director|Worst Director]] for King and [[Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Actor|Worst Actor]] for Estevez in 1987, but both lost to [[Prince (musician)|Prince]] for ''[[Under the Cherry Moon]]''. In 1988, ''Maximum Overdrive'' was nominated for \"Best Film\" at the International Fantasy Film Awards.<ref name=\"razzies\" /> King disowned the film, describing it as a \"moron movie\", and considered the process a learning experience,<ref name=\"HSK\">{{cite book |last=Magistrale |first=Tony |author-link=Tony Magistrale |title=Hollywood's Stephen King |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mKcFPL4Vn0IC&pg=PA20 |access-date=2014-09-09 |date=22 November 2003 |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |location=New York |isbn=978-0-312-29321-5 |page=20 }}</ref> after which he intended never to direct again.<ref>{{cite news | first=Bob | last=Thomas | title='Selling' his movie is a new chore for author Stephen King | agency =[[Associated Press]] | date=1986-07-23 | url =https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=cUARAAAAIBAJ&pg=6738%2C2072608 | access-date = 2010-01-22 }}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nAs the [[Earth]] crosses the tail of a comet, previously inanimate machines suddenly [[AI takeover|spring to life]]; an ATM insults a customer (King in a cameo) and a [[bascule bridge]] rises during heavy traffic, causing all vehicles upon the bridge to fall into the river or collide. Chaos sets in as machines of all kinds begin attacking humans worldwide. At the Dixie Boy Truck Stop just outside [[Wilmington, North Carolina]], employee Duncan Keller is blinded after a gas dispenser sprays diesel in his eyes. An electric knife injures waitress Wanda June, and arcade machines in the back room electrocute a customer. Cook and paroled ex-convict Bill Robinson begins to suspect something is wrong. Meanwhile, at a [[Little League]] game, a vending machine kills the coach by firing canned soda point-blank at him. A driverless [[road roller]] flattens one of the fleeing children, but Duncan's son Deke manages to escape on his bike.\n\nNewlyweds Connie and Curt stop at a gas station, where a [[1967 White 9064 tow truck nicknamed bertha]] ,tries to kill Curt, but he and Connie escape in their car. Deke rides through his town as humans and even pets are brutally killed by lawnmowers, chainsaws, [[Hair dryer|electric hair dryers]], [[Transistor radio|pocket radios]], [[Radio-controlled car|RC cars]] and an ice cream truck. At the Dixie Boy, a garbage truck kills Duncan, and a truck sporting a giant [[Green Goblin]] mask on its grille runs over bible salesman Camp Loman. Later, several [[Big rig|big rig trucks]] encircle the truck stop.\n\nMeanwhile, Connie and Curt are pursued by a [[Mack B series]], but they make it crash off the side of the road as it explodes. They arrive at the truck stop and try to pass between the trucks, but their car is hit and overturns. Bill and Brett Graham, a hitchhiker, rush to help them, but the trucks attack them. The owner Bubba Hendershot uses [[M72 LAW|M72 LAW rockets]] he had stored in a bunker hidden under the diner to destroy many of the trucks. Deke makes it to the truck stop later that evening and tries to enter via the sewers, but is obstructed by the wire mesh covering the opening. That night, the survivors hear Loman screaming in a ditch, and Bill and Curt sneak out to help him by climbing through the sewers. Deke finds Loman and believes he is dead, but he suddenly jumps up and attacks Deke. Bill and Curt rescue Deke, and a truck chases them back into the pipe.\n\nThe next morning, a bulldozer and a [[M274 \u00bd-ton 4\u00d74 utility platform truck|platform truck]] drive to the truck stop. The angered Hendershot uses the rocket launcher to blow up the bulldozer, but the platform truck fires its post-mounted [[M60 machine gun|machine gun]] into the building, killing several people, including Hendershot and Wanda. The truck then demands, via sending [[morse code]] signals through its horn that Deke deciphers, that the humans pump the trucks' diesel for them in exchange for their lives. The survivors soon realize their own machines have enslaved them. Bill suggests they escape to a local island just off the coast, on which no motorized vehicles are permitted. While the crew is resting, Bill theorizes that the comet is actually a \"broom\" operated by interstellar aliens that are using Earth's machines to [[Human extinction|destroy humanity]] so the [[Alien invasion|aliens can repopulate the Earth]]. During a fueling operation, Bill sneaks a grenade onto the platform truck, destroying it, then leads the party out of the diner via a sewer hatch to the main road just as the trucks demolish the entire truck stop. The Green Goblin truck pursues the survivors to the docks, managing to kill trucker Brad when he falls behind. After Bill destroys the truck with a direct hit from a rocket shot, the survivors then sail off to safety. A title card epilogue explains that two days later, a UFO was destroyed by a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] \"weather satellite\" conveniently equipped with class IV nuclear missiles and a [[laser cannon]]. Six days later, Earth passes out of the comet's tail, and the survivors are still alive.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Emilio Estevez]] as Bill Robinson\n* [[Pat Hingle]] as Bubba Hendershot\n* [[Laura Harrington]] as Brett Graham\n* [[Yeardley Smith]] as Connie\n* John Short as Curtis\n* [[Ellen McElduff]] as Wanda June\n* [[Frankie Faison]] as Handy\n* [[Leon Rippy]] as Brad\n* [[Christopher Murney]] as Camp Loman\n* J.

De Laurentiis chose North Carolina because it was a [[Right-to-work_law|\"right to work state\"]], meaning that he could hire non-union crews, which would greatly cut down on production costs.<ref name=\"slashfilm.com\">{{Cite web|last=Harris |first=Blake |url=https://www.slashfilm.com/540033/maximum-overdrive-oral-history/ |title = How Did This Get Made? Maximum Overdrive Oral History |date=September 18, 2015 |website=[[/Film]]}}</ref>\n\nIt would be the directorial debut of writer [[Stephen King]], who had a three picture deal with De Laurentiis. In a 2002 interview with [[Tony Magistrale]] for the book ''Hollywood's Stephen King'', first-time director King stated that he was \"[[cocaine|coked]] out of [his] mind all through its production, and... really didn't know what [he] was doing\".<ref name=\"HSK\"/> On-set translator Roberto Croci didn't remember King's cocaine use, but recalls him drinking from early in the morning until late at night. \"I never saw. I didn't. But I did know that he was drunk. That 6 o'clock in the morning we have a roll call and he's drinking beers. And by 8:30, he's on his 10th beer.<ref name=\"slashfilm.com\"/>\n\nAt a fan screening in 2021, [[Jock Brandis]], the film's gaffer, told the audience that King rode a motorcycle from Maine to Wilmington, so he could ride alongside semi-trucks on the highway. He wanted to get a better feel for how terrifying big-rigs could be when in close proximity, and to better know their loud sounds and movements. When King arrived at the studio on his bike for the initial production meeting, the security guards wouldn't let him through the front gate because they did not believe he was part of any production taking place on the lot. His appearance was disheveled, and he was rambling on about a film he was to direct involving killer trucks that had come alive due to a space comet. He was granted access to the studio lot after Brandis pointed out that the plates on his motorcycle were from Maine. Brandis, a Canadian gaffer who had worked with De Laurentiis on [[David Cronenberg]]'s adaptation of ''[[The Dead Zone (film)|The Dead Zone]]'', was tasked with many jobs not normally given to a film gaffer. De Laurentiis erroneously believed Brandis could speak Italian, and would be able to bridge the language gap between Italian cinematographer [[Armando Nannuzzi]] and the local crew. Nannuzzi had previously worked in Wilmington with De Laurentiis on ''[[Cat's Eye (1985 film)|Cat's Eye]]'', and would struggle with communication throughout the film, often nodding and replying \"yes, yes, yes,\" to every question.<ref name=\"slashfilm.com\"/> Along with being the production's chief lighting technician, Brandis procured many of the trucks used in production, most of which still featured names from actual local businesses on the cabs and trailers. Brandis is also featured in the opening scenes of the film, driving a 1968 Ford F-Series dump truck over the Isabella Holmes draw bridge when it opens.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Staton |first=John |date=September 16, 2021 |url=https://www.starnewsonline.com/story/entertainment/2021/09/16/5-things-do-your-wilmington-nc-weekend-sept-17-19/8315102002/|title=5 things to do this Wilmington weekend: Art, theater, comedy and a St. Patrick's Day parade? |website=[[Star-News|Wilmington StarNews]]}}</ref>\n\nStephen King originally wanted [[Bruce Springsteen]] to play the role of Bill Robinson. Springsteen was unknown by De Laurentiis, so De Laurentiis personally hired \"Martin's (Sheen) son,\" [[Emilio Estevez]]. It is believed De Laurentiis's insistence that Est\u00e9vez participate in the film was when Stephen King became disillusioned with the production.<ref name=\"slashfilm.com\"/> King did try to create a positive environment for the crew, at one point renting out an entire theater to screen classic films such as [[Godzilla (1954 film)|\"Godzilla\"]] and \"[[Night of the Living Dead]]\". He provided free refreshments and personal commentary during each film. King would also participate in golf cart races on the studio lot during down time.<ref name=\"slashfilm.com\"/>\n\nMany wardrobe and special effects choices were made by De Laurentiis personally. During a dailies screening of [[Laura Harrington]]'s first scene, De Laurentiis became upset that she was wearing jeans. A new scene was written so she could change into something more revealing for the rest of the film.<ref name=\"slashfilm.com\"/>\n\nThe \"Dixie Boy Truck Stop\" set was built alongside of US-17/74, just across the Cape Fear River near Wilmington, North Carolina. It was a purpose-built location, existing specifically for the film. The land is now a privately owned storage area.\n\nAll of the interior scenes were filmed at De Laurentiis' Wilmington-based studio facility, which at the time was called \"DEG,\" or De Laurentiis Entertainment Group. One of the iconic Green Goblin heads from the cab of the Happy Toys truck remained on the studio lot until the mid-90's, when it was sold to a private collector.\n\nWhile shooting the scene when a lawnmower comes alive in a residential neighborhood, cinematographer [[Armando Nannuzzi]] was struck in the right eye, his \"shooting eye,\" by a large splinter of wood that had become lodged in the blade. According to camera assistant Silvia Giulietti, \"We were shooting a scene where a lawnmower\u2014the machine that cut the grass\u2014was following a boy to kill him. And we put the camera on the ground with piece of wood beneath. To wedge, okay? I remember that Armando Nanuzzi ask to Stephen King, \"Can we take out the blades?\" But Stephen King say, \"no, no, I like to see them.\" Armando say, \"But we don't see them in the shot.\" But Stephen King say, \"No. No. Better that you let it.\"<ref name=\"slashfilm.com\"/> The special effects department had also suggested removing the blade for safety reasons, but King continued to insist that it remain, so the scene could appear more life-like. Nannuzzi was helicoptered from set and then flown to a hospital in Raleigh where he eventually lost his eye. Production was halted for a brief period, but Nannuzzi returned to finish the film.<ref name=\"slashfilm.com\"/> After the film was released, Nannuzzi sued King, De Laurentiis Productions, and sixteen others involved with the film for $18,000,000. The suit was filed in New York, as King and many of the other defendants often did business in that state. The case was later settled.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/1987/02/21/stephen-king-sued-over-injury/ab640b57-6bb6-4c51-84fd-c1754b8571de/ |title=Stephen King Sued Over Injury |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |date=February 27, 1987}}</ref> Nannuzzi continued to work on films after his accident, but believed he would never again be considered for big-budget projects, as producers wouldn't want a cameraman with no depth perception.<ref name=\"slashfilm.com\"/> He returned to Italy, where he worked until his retirement in 1998.

Winds and rain were very heavy, and the crews created a competition to see who could move from stage to stage without being blown over. Production was eventually halted again for a brief time while the storm passed and the studio lot could be assessed for damage.<ref name=\"slashfilm.com\"/>\n\nActor [[Pat Hingle]], who played Dixie Boy owner Bubba Hendershot, moved to Wilmington after the production wrapped.
