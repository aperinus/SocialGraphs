[[Ethan Hawke]] plays [[Prince Hamlet|Hamlet]] as a film student, [[Kyle MacLachlan]] co-stars as [[King Claudius|Uncle Claudius]], with [[Diane Venora]] as [[Gertrude (Hamlet)|Gertrude]], [[Liev Schreiber]] as [[Laertes (Hamlet)|Laertes]], [[Julia Stiles]] as [[Ophelia (character)|Ophelia]], [[Steve Zahn]] as [[Rosencrantz and Guildenstern|Rosencrantz]], [[Bill Murray]] as [[Polonius]], and [[Sam Shepard]] as [[Ghost (Hamlet)|Hamlet's father]].\n\nIn this version of ''Hamlet'', Claudius is \"king\" of the Denmark Corporation, having taken over the firm by killing his brother, Hamlet's father.\n\nThis adaptation keeps the Shakespearean dialogue but presents a modern setting, with technology such as [[video camera]]s, [[Instant camera#Cameras and film|Polaroid cameras]], and [[Covert listening device|surveillance bugs]]. For example, the [[ghost]] of Hamlet's murdered father first appears on [[Closed-circuit television|closed-circuit TV]].\n\n==Adaptations==\n*[[Kronborg Castle|Elsinore Castle]], the seat of power of [[Denmark]]'s crown in the play, is re-imagined as Hotel Elsinore, the headquarters of Denmark Corporation.\n*Prior to delivering the \"[[To be, or not to be]]\" monologue, Hamlet is seen watching a video of famed [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] teacher [[Thich Nhat Hanh]] explaining the principle \"To be is to be with others; to be is to inter-be\" a basic teaching of Hanh's \"[[Order of Interbeing]]\".\n*The \"Mousetrap\" play takes the form of a [[video art]] montage, edited by Hamlet himself.\n*The character of [[Characters in Hamlet#Barnardo, Francisco and Marcellus|Marcellus]], one of the soldiers, is re-imagined as Marcella, Horatio's girlfriend.\n*The [[Characters in Hamlet#A Captain|Captain]] in [[Fortinbras]]' army is replaced by a [[flight attendant]] on Hamlet's flight to England.\n*Instead of carrying around actual flowers, Ophelia carries [[Instant camera#Cameras and film|polaroid]] photographs of various flowers. In the film, Ophelia is an amateur photographer.\n*Fortinbras' conquests are not military, but corporate takeovers with the aid of his \"armies\" of lawyers.\n*As opposed to drowning in a brook, Ophelia is found to have drowned in a fountain in front of the Hotel Elsinore, surrounded by mementos of her relationship with Hamlet.\n*The Ghost of King Hamlet appears in Horatio's apartment, sitting in his bedroom as Marcella sleeps, before Hamlet and Horatio enter it.\n*The first intervention of [[Characters in Hamlet#Osric|Osric]] is re-imagined as a fax machine in Hamlet and Horatio's apartment, delivering Laertes' message right before the duel. However, Osric does appear during the duel between Hamlet and Laertes.\n*Laertes does not kill Hamlet with a poisoned rapier. Instead he shoots Hamlet with a pistol, then is shot himself. Hamlet then uses the same pistol to shoot and kill Claudius.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n*[[Ethan Hawke]] as [[Prince Hamlet|Hamlet]]\n*[[Kyle MacLachlan]] as [[King Claudius|Claudius]]\n*[[Diane Venora]] as [[Gertrude (Hamlet)|Gertrude]]\n*[[Sam Shepard]] as [[Ghost (Hamlet)|Ghost]]\n*[[Liev Schreiber]] as [[Laertes (Hamlet)|Laertes]]\n*[[Julia Stiles]] as [[Ophelia]]\n*[[Bill Murray]] as [[Polonius]]\n*[[Karl Geary]] as [[Horatio (character)|Horatio]]\n*[[Paula Malcomson]] as [[Characters in Hamlet#Marcellus, Barnardo and Francisco|Marcella]]\n*[[Steve Zahn]] as [[Rosencrantz and Guildenstern|Rosencrantz]]\n*Dechen Thurman as [[Rosencrantz and Guildenstern|Guildenstern]]\n*Rome Neal as [[Characters in Hamlet#Marcellus, Barnardo and Francisco|Barnardo]]\n*[[Jeffrey Wright]] as [[The Gravediggers|Gravedigger]]\n*[[Paul Bartel]] as [[Characters in Hamlet#Osric|Osric]]\n*[[Casey Affleck]] as [[Fortinbras]]\n*[[Robert Thurman]] as [[Characters in Hamlet#A Priest.2C or Doctor of Divinity|Priest]]\n*[[Tim Blake Nelson]] as Flight captain\n*[[Larry Fessenden]] as Kissing Man\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Reception==\nReviews of this film have been mixed.
