Adapted by [[David Benioff]] from his own 2001 debut novel ''[[The 25th Hour]]'', it tells the story of a man's last 24 hours of freedom as he prepares to go to prison for seven years for dealing drugs.\n\n''25th Hour'' opened to positive reviews, with several critics since having named it one of the best films of its decade and praising it for its portrayal of [[New York City]] after the [[September 11 attacks]].\n\n==Plot==\nA car pulls up on a [[New York City]] street, which Monty Brogan exits with his friend Kostya to look at an injured dog lying in the road. Monty intends to perform a [[Coup de gr\u00e2ce|mercy kill]] and shoot him, but changes his mind after he looks it in the eye; he takes the dog to a nearby clinic instead.\n\nA few years later, Monty is about to begin serving a seven-year prison sentence for dealing drugs. He sits in a park with Doyle, the dog he rescued, on his last day of freedom. He plans to meet childhood friends Frank, a boorish [[Wall Street]] trader, and Jacob, an introverted high school teacher with a crush on his student Mary, at a club with his girlfriend Naturelle.\n\nMonty visits his father, James, a former firefighter and recovering alcoholic at his bar, to confirm their plans to drive to the prison the following morning. James was able to establish the bar with Monty\u2019s drug money, and remorsefully sneaks a drink when Monty goes to the bathroom. Facing himself in the mirror, Monty lashes out in his mind against everyone in New York before finally turning on himself, angry for becoming greedy and not giving up drug dealing before he was caught.\n\nIn a flashback, Monty remembers the night he was arrested: [[Drug Enforcement Administration|DEA]] agents raided Monty's apartment and quickly found the drugs he was selling for Uncle Nikolai, a Russian mobster. Kostya tries to persuade Monty it was Naturelle who betrayed him, since she knew where he hid his drugs and money. Monty refused to [[turn state's evidence]] against Nikolai, but is unsure about Nikolai\u2019s actions. Monty remembers how he met Naturelle hanging around his old school, and how happy they were. He then asks Frank to find out if it was Naturelle who betrayed him.\n\nJacob sees Mary outside the club, and Monty invites her inside with them. Discussing what kind of a future Monty can have after prison, Frank says they can open a bar together, even though he told Jacob that he believes Monty deserves his sentence for dealing drugs. Frank accuses Naturelle of living high on Monty's money despite knowing its origins, but she retorts that Frank also knew but said nothing. The argument culminates with Frank insulting Naturelle's ethnicity, followed by her slapping Frank and leaving. Jacob, meanwhile, finds the courage to kiss Mary, but both are shocked afterwards and go their separate ways.\n\nMonty and Kostya go to see Nikolai, who gives Monty advice on surviving in prison. Nikolai then reveals it was Kostya who betrayed Monty, and offers him a chance to kill Kostya in exchange for protecting his father's bar. Monty refuses, reminding Nikolai that he was the one who told Monty to trust Kostya in the first place. Monty walks out, leaving Kostya to be killed by the Russian mobsters.\n\nMonty returns to his apartment and apologizes to Naturelle for mistrusting her. He then hands Doyle over to Jacob in the park. He admits that he is terrified of being raped in prison, whereupon he asks Frank to beat him, believing that he might have a chance at survival if he enters the prison ugly. Frank refuses, and Monty goads Frank into taking out his frustrations, leaving Monty bruised and bloody, with a broken nose.\n\nNaturelle tries to comfort him as Monty's father arrives to take him to [[Federal Correctional Institution, Otisville]]. On the drive to prison, Monty once again sees a parade of faces from the streets of the city. James suggests they go west, into hiding, giving Monty a vision of a future where he avoids imprisonment, reunites with Naturelle, starts a family, and grows old. As the fantasy ends, Monty and James drive past the bridge to the west and towards prison.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Edward Norton]] as Monty Brogan\n* [[Philip Seymour Hoffman]] as Jacob Elinsky\n* [[Barry Pepper]] as Frank Slaugherty\n* [[Rosario Dawson]] as Naturelle Riviera\n* [[Anna Paquin]] as Mary D'Annunzio\n* [[Brian Cox (actor)|Brian Cox]] as James Brogan\n* [[Tony Siragusa]] as Kostya Novotny\n* Levan Uchaneishvili as Uncle Nikolai\n* Tony Devon as Agent Allen\n* Misha Kuznetsov as Senka Valghobek\n* [[Isiah Whitlock Jr.]] as Agent Flood\n* [[Michael Genet]] as Agent Cunningham\n* [[Patrice O'Neal]] as Khari\n* Al Palagonia as Salvatore Dominick\n* [[Aaron Stanford]] as Marcuse\n* [[Marc H.

Six months before the book's publication a preliminary trade copy was circulated which [[Tobey Maguire]] read, and he was interested in playing the role of Monty Brogan. He acquired the option for a potential film project and asked Benioff to adapt it into a screenplay.<ref name=\"dartmouth\">{{cite news |url=http://thedartmouth.com/2011/05/12/benioff-92-embraces-storytelling-in-surreal-career/ |title=Benioff '92 embraces storytelling in 'surreal' career |author=Katie Kilkenny |date=May 12, 2011 |work=The Dartmouth |access-date=June 16, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160816111920/http://thedartmouth.com/2011/05/12/benioff-92-embraces-storytelling-in-surreal-career |archive-date=August 16, 2016 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref name=Guardian /> However, after the script was written, Maguire became pre-occupied with the ''[[Spider-Man (2002 film)|Spider-Man]]'' film and had to abandon the plan, although he would later act as a producer on the film that was made.
