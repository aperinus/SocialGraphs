It was Murphy's second feature stand-up comedy film, following ''[[Eddie Murphy Delirious]]''. However, unlike ''Delirious'', ''Raw'' received a wide theatrical release. The 90-minute show was filmed at the [[Hulu Theater|Felt Forum]], a venue in the [[Madison Square Garden]] complex in [[New York City]]. The film was released in the United States on December 18, 1987. As of January 2022, it is the highest-grossing stand-up comedy concert film ever released, making $50.5 million in the United States and Canada.\n\n==Plot==\nThe film opens with a pre-taped sketch depicting a scene from Murphy's childhood. At a family [[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving]] in November 1968, the children take turns showing their talents to the assembled relatives (including one played by Murphy himself). Young Eddie ([[Deon Richmond]]) shocks the family with a rude joke about a monkey and a lion.\n\nAfter emerging on stage for the live show, Murphy begins by discussing the angry reactions of celebrities parodied in his previous stand-up show, ''[[Eddie Murphy Delirious|Delirious]]'', specifically [[Mr. T]] and [[Michael Jackson]], as well as [[Homosexuality|homosexual]] viewers offended by his jokes about \"[[Faggot (slang)|faggots]].\" Murphy then narrates a phone call he received from [[Bill Cosby]] chastising him for using profanity on stage. Angered by Cosby's assumption that his entire act was nothing but \"filth foul filth,\" Murphy calls [[Richard Pryor]] for advice. Pryor declares that his only concerns should be making audiences laugh and getting paid, and recommends that he tell Cosby to \"[[Bill Cosby in advertising|Have a Coke and a smile]] and shut the fuck up.\" Murphy elaborates on his admiration for the \"raw\" comedy of Pryor, running through a routine from his own teenage years about [[defecation]], in Pryor's voice. He then goes on to talk about how people who don't speak English only pick up the curse words in his act, and shout them at him on the street.\n\nNext comes a lengthy routine about dating and relationships. Murphy explains that the rise of deadly [[sexually transmitted infection]]s has motivated him to seek marriage, but the divorce of [[Johnny Carson]] and Joanna Holland (in which she sought 50% of his assets) has left him [[Paranoia|paranoid]] about the financial risk of marriage, concluding that \"no pussy is worth $150 million.\" He mocks the aggression and materialism of American women (compared to his believed meekness of Japanese women), referring to the popularity of [[Janet Jackson]]'s song \"[[What Have You Done for Me Lately]].\" He jokes that he intends to go deep into [[Africa]] to find a \"bush bitch\" who has no concept of Western culture... at least until American women convince her to stand up for herself and demand \"HALF!\" This develops into a broader warning to men to avoid \"the pussy trap,\" and a warning to women that men never remain faithful \u2014 once a man has evoked a powerful orgasm from a woman (\"ooohhhh!\") she will tolerate all kinds of misbehavior, although she may pursue infidelity of her own.\n\nThe next segment narrates a childhood memory of his mother promising to cook him a [[hamburger]] \"better than [[McDonald's]],\" only to produce an unappealing \"[[Social programs in the United States|welfare]] burger,\" a lump of beef filled with onion and green peppers on [[Wonder Bread]] (while the neighborhood children show off their McDonald's hamburgers in a call-back to the ice cream segment of ''Delirious''), but he states that as an adult, he has more of an appreciation of the tastiness of his mom's homemade dish.\n\nMurphy then talks about white people out on the town, criticizing their embarrassing dance moves, leading onto [[Italian Americans|Italian-American]]s being inspired by ''[[Rocky (film series)|Rocky]]'', then culminates to a bit about fighting in a discotheque with [[Deney Terrio]], eventually starting a large-scale brawl after which \"everybody sued me\" for millions of dollars.\n\nAfter the fight, Murphy calls his parents, leading to a long impression of his [[Alcohol intoxication|drunken]] stepfather (another call-back to a popular bit from ''Delirious''). This final segment runs for over 10 minutes and incorporates his stepfather's habit of misquoting Motown songs (including \"Ain't Too Proud to Beg\", which opened the film).\n\n==Cast (opening segment)==\n* [[Eddie Murphy]] as Himself\n* [[Tatyana Ali]] as Eddie's sister (sketch)\n* [[Deon Richmond]] as Little Eddie (sketch)\n* [[Billie Allen]] as Eddie's aunt (sketch)\n* [[James Brown III]] as Thanksgiving guest\n* [[Michelle Davison]] as Thanksgiving guest\n* [[Leonard Jackson (actor)|Leonard Jackson]] as Uncle Gus (sketch)\n* [[Samuel L.
