The film is set in and around a state secondary school in the [[Abronhill]] district of [[Cumbernauld]].\n\n''Gregory's Girl'' was ranked No.&nbsp;30 in the [[British Film Institute]]'s list of the [[BFI Top 100 British films|top 100 British films]] of the 20th century, and No.&nbsp;29 on ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''{{'}}s 2015 list of the 50 best high school movies.<ref>{{Cite magazine |date=28 August 2015 |title=The 50 Best High School Movies |url=http://ew.com/gallery/50-best-high-school-movies-0/#29-gregorys-girl-1982 |access-date=14 April 2018 |magazine=[[Entertainment Weekly]] (ew.com)}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nGregory Underwood is an awkward teenager who plays on his school [[Association football|football]] team. They are not doing very well, so the coach holds a trial to find new players. Dorothy shows up and, despite the coach's sexist misgivings, proves to be a very good player. She subsequently takes Gregory's place as centre forward, and Gregory in turn replaces his friend Andy as goalkeeper.\n\nGregory is all for her making the team, as he finds her very attractive. However, he has to compete for her attention with all the other boys who share the same opinion. Gregory initially confides in his best friend Steve, the most mature of Gregory's circle of friends, and asks him for help in attracting Dorothy. Steve, however, is unable to assist him.\n\nActing on the advice of his precocious 10-year-old sister Madeleine, he awkwardly asks Dorothy out on a date. She accepts, but Dorothy's friend, Carol, shows up at the rendezvous instead and informs Gregory that something had come up; Dorothy will not be able to make it. He is disappointed, but Carol talks him into taking her to the [[Fish and chips#Fish and chip shops|chip shop]].\n\nWhen they arrive, she hands him off to another friend, Margo, and leaves. By then, Gregory is rather confused, but goes for a walk with the new girl. On their stroll, they encounter a waiting Susan, another of Dorothy's friends, and Margo leaves. Susan confesses that it was all arranged by her friends, including Dorothy. She explains, \"It's just the way girls work. They help each other.\"\n\nThey go to the park and talk. At the date's end, Gregory is more than pleased with Susan, and the two kiss numerous times on his doorstep before calling it a night and arranging a second date. Madeleine, who had been watching from the window, quizzes him on his date and calls him a liar when he claims he did not kiss Susan.\n\nGregory's friends, Andy and Charlie, are even more inept with girls but see Gregory at various times with three apparent dates, and are envious of his new success. They try to hitchhike to [[Caracas]], where Andy has heard the women greatly outnumber the men, but fail at that as well.\n\n==Cast==\n<!--- cast and order per opening credits, roles per closing credits scroll --->\n{{cast listing|\n* [[John Gordon Sinclair]] as Gregory\n* [[Dee Hepburn]] as Dorothy\n* [[Clare Grogan]] as Susan\n* [[Jake D'Arcy]] as Phil Menzies\n* [[Charles Murray (comedian)|Chic Murray]] as Headmaster\n* [[Alex Norton]] as Alec\n* John Bett as Alistair\n* [[Dave Anderson (actor)|David Anderson]] as Gregory\u2019s Dad\n* [[Robert Buchanan (actor)|Robert Buchanan]] as Andy\n* Allan Love as Eric\n* Allison Forster as Madeline\n* Carol Macartney as Margo\n* William Greenlees as Steve\n* [[Douglas Sannachan]] as Billy\n* Caroline Guthrie as Carol\n* Graham Thompson as Charlie\n}}\n\n==Production==\nProduced on a budget of \u00a3200,000 the film generated worldwide box office revenue of \u00a325.8 million.<ref name = \"Robey\">{{cite news |last=Robey |first=Tim |date=4 April 2021 |title=Gregory's Girl: the little British film that charmed the world  |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/0/gregorys-girl-little-british-film-charmed-world/ |access-date=27 July 2021}}</ref> Many of the young actors were members of the [[Glasgow]] Youth Theatre, and had appeared in Forsyth's earlier film ''[[That Sinking Feeling]]'' (1979), including Robert Buchanan, Billy Greenlees, and John Gordon Sinclair.

[A]ttention is directed towards wider, broadly political issues, but Forsyth's assured craftsmanship ensures that they are deftly woven into the storytelling.
