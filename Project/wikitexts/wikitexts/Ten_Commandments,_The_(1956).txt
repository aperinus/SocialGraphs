[[Jochebed|Yochabel]] saves her infant son by setting him adrift in a basket on the [[Nile]]. [[Bithiah]], the Pharaoh Rameses' recently widowed daughter (and sister of the future Pharaoh [[Seti I]]), finds the basket and decides to adopt the boy, even though her servant, Memnet, recognizes that the child is Hebrew. Bithiah names the baby [[Moses]].\n\nPrince Moses grows up to become a successful general, winning a war with [[Ethiopia]] and establishing an alliance. Moses and [[Nefertari|Nefretiri]] fall in love, but she must marry the next Pharaoh to preserve the royal line. While working on the building of a city for Pharaoh [[Seti I]]'s jubilee, Moses meets the stonecutter [[Joshua]], who tells him of the Hebrew God. Moses saves an elderly woman from being crushed, not knowing that she is his biological mother, Yochabel, and he reprimands the taskmaster and overseer Baka.\n\nMoses reforms the treatment of [[slaves]] on the project, but Prince Rameses, Moses's adoptive brother and Seti's son, charges him with planning an insurrection. Moses says he is making his workers more productive, making Rameses wonder if Moses is the man the Hebrews are calling the Deliverer.\n\nNefretiri learns from Memnet that Moses is the son of Hebrew slaves. She kills Memnet, but reveals the story to Moses after he finds the piece of [[Levite]] cloth he was wrapped in as a baby, which Memnet had kept. Moses follows Bithiah to Yochabel's house, where he meets his biological mother, brother Aaron, and sister Miriam.\n\nMoses learns more about the slaves by working with them. Nefretiri urges him to return to the palace, so that he may help his people when he becomes pharaoh, to which he agrees after he completes a final task. Moses saves Joshua from death by killing Baka, telling Joshua that he, too, is Hebrew. The confession is witnessed by the overseer [[Dathan]], who then reports to Prince Rameses. After being arrested, Moses explains that he is not the Deliverer, but would free the slaves if he could. [[Seti I]] declares Prince Rameses his sole heir, and Rameses banishes Moses to the desert. At this time, Moses learns of the death of his mother.\n\nMoses makes his way across the desert to a well in [[Midian]]. After defending seven sisters from [[Amalekites]], Moses is housed with the girls' father [[Jethro (Bible)|Jethro]], a Bedouin sheik, who worships the God of Abraham. Moses marries Jethro's eldest daughter [[Zipporah|Sephora]]. Later, he finds Joshua, who has escaped from the hard labor imposed on the Hebrews in Egypt. While herding, Moses sees the [[burning bush]] on the summit of [[Mount Sinai]] and hears the voice of God. Moses returns to Egypt to free the Hebrews.\n\n=== Part II ===\nMoses comes before Rameses, now Pharaoh [[Rameses II]], to win the slaves' freedom, turning his staff into a [[cobra]]. [[Jannes and Jambres|Jannes]] performs the same trick with his staves, but Moses's snake swallows his. Rameses prohibits straw from being provided to the Hebrews to make their bricks. Nefretiri rescues Moses from being stoned to death by the Hebrews wherein he reveals that he is married.\n\nEgypt is visited by [[Plagues of Egypt|plagues]]. Moses turns the river Nile to blood at a festival of [[Khnum]], and brings burning hail down upon Pharaoh's palace. Moses warns him that the next plague to fall upon Egypt will be summoned by Pharaoh himself. Enraged at the plagues, Rameses orders that all first-born male Hebrews will die, but a cloud of death instead kills all the first-born of Egypt, including the child of Rameses and Nefretiri. Despairing at the loss of his heir, Pharaoh exiles the Hebrews, who begin [[the Exodus]] from Egypt.\n\nAfter being taunted by Nefretiri, Rameses takes his chariots and pursues the Hebrews to the [[Red Sea]]. Moses uses God's help to stop the Egyptians with a [[Pillar of Fire (theophany)|pillar of fire]], and [[Crossing the Red Sea|parts the Red Sea]]. After the Hebrews make it to safety, Moses releases the walls of water, drowning the Egyptian army. A devastated Rameses returns empty-handed to Nefretiri, stating that he now acknowledges Moses's god as God.\n\nMoses again ascends the mountain with Joshua. He sees the [[Ten Commandments]] created by God in [[Tablets of Stone|two stone tablets]]. Meanwhile, an impatient  Dathan tells the people that Moses is dead and urges a reluctant Aaron to construct a [[golden calf]] idol. A wild saturnalia occurs and a decadent [[orgy]] is held by most of the Hebrews. \n<!-- DO NOT add biblical information here. This film is not about the book of Exodus; making historical/biblical comparisons here is not relevant, and it does not contribute to the completeness of the article. DO NOT add it again. -->\n\nAfter God informs Moses of the Hebrews fallen into debauchery, the latter descends from the mountain with Joshua. Enraged at the sight of decadence he deems the Hebrews unworthy, and smashes the tablets at the golden calf, which explodes, killing the wicked revelers, and causing the others to wander in the wilderness for forty years. An elderly Moses later leads the Hebrews towards [[Canaan]]. However, he cannot enter the Promised land due to a mentioned previous disobedience to the Lord. He instead names Joshua as leader, and bids farewell to the Hebrews at [[Mount Nebo]].\n\n== Cast ==\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Charlton Heston]] as [[Moses]] (and the voice of God at the Burning Bush)<ref name=\"Charlton Heston: The EW Q&A\" />\n* [[Yul Brynner]] as [[Ramesses II|Rameses II]]\n* [[Anne Baxter]] as [[Nefertari|Nefretiri]]\n* [[Edward G.

Sinai stone with Cecil B. DeMille. Inscription is identical to the props in the film.]]\nCommentary for the film's DVD edition chronicles the historical research done by DeMille and associates.\nThe man who designed Moses' distinctive rust-white-and-black-striped robe used those colors because they looked impressive, and only later discovered that these are the actual colors of the Tribe of Levi. [[Arnold Friberg]] would later state that he was the one who designed Moses' costume. As a gift, after the production, DeMille gave Moses' robe to Friberg, who had it in his possession until his death in 2010. Moses' robe as worn by Charlton Heston was hand-woven by Dorothea Hulse, one of the world's finest weavers. She also created costumes for [[The Robe (film)|''The Robe'']], as well as textiles and costume fabrics for ''[[Samson and Delilah (1949 film)|Samson and Delilah]]'', ''[[David and Bathsheba (film)|David and Bathsheba]]'', and others.\n\nJesse Lasky Jr., a co-writer on ''The Ten Commandments'', described how DeMille would customarily spread out prints of paintings by [[Lawrence Alma-Tadema]] to inform his set designers on the look he wanted to achieve. Arnold Friberg, in addition to designing sets and costumes, also contributed the manner in which Moses ordained [[Joshua]] to his mission at the end of the film: by the laying on of hands, placing his hands on Joshua's head. Friberg, a member of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]], demonstrated the LDS manner of performing such ordinations, and DeMille liked it.\n\nThe Pharaoh is usually shown wearing the [[Pschent|red-and-white crown]] of [[Upper and Lower Egypt]] or the [[nemes]] royal headdress. For his pursuit of the Israelites, he wears the blue [[Khepresh]] helmet-crown, which the pharaohs wore for battle.\n\nSets, costumes and props from the film ''[[The Egyptian (film)|The Egyptian]]'' were bought and re-used for ''The Ten Commandments''\u2014including the red-and-white double crown. As the events in ''The Egyptian'' take place 70 years before the reign of Rameses II, an unintentional sense of continuity was created.\n\nAn Egyptian wall painting was also the source for the lively dance performed by a circle of young women at Sethi's birthday gala. Their movements and costumes are based on art from the Tomb of the Sixth Dynasty Grand Vizier [[Mehu]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.touregypt.net/featurestories/partytime.htm|title=Party Time in Ancient Egypt}}</ref>\nSome of the film's cast members, such as [[Anne Baxter|Baxter]], [[Debra Paget|Paget]], [[John Derek|Derek]], and [[Nina Foch|Foch]], wore brown [[contact lens]]es, at the behest of DeMille, in order to conceal their light-colored eyes which were considered inadequate for their roles.<ref name=\"Now Stars Change Eyes Just Like Pair Of Shoes\">{{cite news |last=Belser |first=Emily |title=Now Stars Change Eyes Just Like Pair Of Shoes |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2206&dat=19550601&id=BtUzAAAAIBAJ&pg=3432,38731 |access-date=March 28, 2014 |newspaper=[[The Miami News]] |date=June 1, 1955}}</ref> Paget once said that, \"If it hadn't been for the lenses I wouldn't have got the part.\"<ref name=\"Now Stars Change Eyes Just Like Pair Of Shoes\" /> However, she also said that the lenses were \"awful to work in because the [[Klieg light|kleig lights]] heat them up\".<ref name=\"Now Stars Change Eyes Just Like Pair Of Shoes\" /> When DeMille cast [[Yvonne De Carlo]] as [[Zipporah|Sephora]], she was worried about having to wear these contact lenses; she also believed that her gray eyes were her best feature.<ref name=\"Katherine Orrison's audio commentary for ''The Ten Commandments'' 50th Anniversary Collection DVD (2006)\">Katherine Orrison's audio commentary for ''The Ten Commandments'' 50th Anniversary Collection DVD (2006)</ref> She asked DeMille to make an exception for her.

It was built outside Cairo, Egypt, and was designed by Egyptian architect El Dine. Inside the set were a mess tent, a wardrobe department, and a stable for horses.

Initially, DeMille hired Bernstein, then a relatively unknown film composer, to write and record only the [[diegetic music]] required for the film's dance sequences and other onscreen musical passages, with the intention of employing frequent collaborator [[Victor Young]] to write the score proper. However, Young turned down the assignment due to his own failing health, causing DeMille to hire Bernstein to write the underscore as well.<ref name=\"DeWald\">{{cite news|last1=DeWald|first1=Frank K.|title=So Let It Be Written.

The score is written in a highly [[Romantic music|Romantic]] style, featuring unique musical [[leitmotif]]s for the film's characters (God, Moses, Rameses, Nefretiri, Dathan, Sephora, Lilia, Joshua, etc.) used in a manner inspired, at DeMille's direction, by the opera scores of [[Richard Wagner]].<ref name=\"DeWald\"/> Bernstein recorded both the diegetic music and the  score at the Paramount Studios Recording Stage in sessions spread from April 1955 to August 1956.<ref>{{cite news|title=Technical Notes|work=The Ten Commandments: 60th Anniversary Soundtrack Collection|publisher=Intrada Records|date=2016}}</ref>\n\nA double-LP [[monaural]] soundtrack album was released in 1957 by [[Dot Records]], utilizing excerpts from the original film recordings.

Shinan |chapter=Moses and the Ethiopian Woman: Sources of a Story in The Chronicle of Moses |series=Scripta Hierosolymitana |volume=27 |publication-date=1978}}</ref> For decades, a showing of ''The Ten Commandments'' was a popular fundraiser among revivalist [[Christian Church]]es, while the film was equally treasured by film buffs for DeMille's \"cast of thousands\" approach and the heroic acting.\n\n[[Martin Scorsese]] later said it was one of his favorite films, writing in 1978 that:\n<blockquote>I like De Mille: his theatricality, his images. I've seen The Ten Commandments maybe forty or fifty times. Forget the story - you've got to - and concentrate on the special effects, and the texture, and the color. For example: The figure of God, killing the first-born child, is a green smoke; then on the terrace, while they're talking, a green dry ice just touches the heel of George Reeves or somebody, and he dies. Then there's the reel Red Sea, and the lamb's blood of the Passover. De Mille presented a fantasy, dream-like quality on film that was so real, if you saw his movies as a child, they stuck with you for life.<ref>Martin Scorsese's Guilty Pleasures\nScorsese, Martin.

Since 2006 the network has typically aired ''The Ten Commandments'' on the Saturday night prior to Easter, with the broadcast starting at 7:00&nbsp;p.m. in the [[Eastern Time Zone|Eastern]] and [[Pacific Time Zone]]s and 6:00&nbsp;p.m. in the [[Central Time Zone|Central]], [[Mountain Time Zone|Mountain]], [[Alaska Time Zone|Alaska]] and [[Hawaii Time Zone]]s. (Exceptions occurred in 2020 when the film aired prior to [[Palm Sunday]], which that year was April 4, due to the [[COVID-19 pandemic]]; and in 2022, when the film aired on April 9, the Saturday before Palm Sunday, due to an [[NBA Saturday Primetime|NBA game telecast]] scheduled on the night before Easter the following week.) The film is one of only two pre-scheduled ''[[ABC Saturday Movie of the Week|ABC Saturday Movies of the Week]]'' every year, the other being ''[[The Sound of Music (1965 film)|The Sound of Music]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/story/2020-04-03/whats-on-tv-saturday-april-4-line-of-duty-plus-sunday-talk-shows|title=What's on TV Saturday, April 4: 'Line of Duty'; plus, Sunday talk shows|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|last=Stockly|first=Ed|date=April 3, 2020|access-date=April 8, 2020}}</ref>\n\nUnlike many lengthy films of the day, which were usually broken up into separate airings over at least two nights, ABC elected to show ''The Ten Commandments'' in one night and has done so every year it has carried the film, with one exception; in 1997, ABC elected to split the movie in two and aired half of it in its normal Easter Sunday slot, which that year was March 30, with the second half airing on Monday, March 31 as counterprogramming to the other networks' offerings, which included [[CBS]]' coverage of the [[1997 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Championship Game|NCAA Men's Basketball Championship Game]].<ref>''TV Guide'' listings for March 29 \u2013 April 4, 1997.</ref>\n\nThe length of the film combined with the necessary advertisement breaks has caused its broadcast window to vary over the years; today, ABC's total run time for ''The Ten Commandments'' stands at four hours and 44 minutes, just above one hour longer than its three-hour and 39-minute length. This requires the network to overrun into the 11:00&nbsp;p.m./10:00&nbsp;p.m. timeslot that belongs to the local affiliates, thus delaying their late [[local news]] and any other programming they may air in the overnight hours. Affiliates may also delay the film to the usual start of [[prime time]] at 8:00&nbsp;p.m./7:00&nbsp;p.m. to keep their schedules in line for early evening, at the cost of further delaying their local newscasts or forgoing them entirely.\n\nIn 2010, the film was broadcast in [[high-definition television|high definition]] for the first time, which allowed the television audience to see it in its original 1.66:1 VistaVision aspect ratio. It is also broadcast with its original [[Spanish language]] dub over the [[second audio program]] channel. In 2015, for the first time in several years, the network undertook a one-off airing of the film on Easter Sunday night, which fell on April 5.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.channelguidemagblog.com/index.php/2015/02/27/abc-to-broadcast-the-ten-commandments-on-easter/|title=ABC to Broadcast \"The Ten Commandments\" on Easter|work=Channel Guide Magazine|date=February 27, 2015}}</ref>\n\nMany of ABC's telecasts omit Cecil B. DeMille's opening prologue, objectionable scenes, and musical elements (Overture, Entr\u2019acte, and Exit Music) seen in the theatrical release.\n\nIn the Philippines, the film is traditionally aired every Holy Week since it premiered on April 1, 2015, on [[GMA Network]], either cut for time or in full, and dubbed in [[Filipino language|Filipino]].\n\n; Ratings by year (since 2007)\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!
