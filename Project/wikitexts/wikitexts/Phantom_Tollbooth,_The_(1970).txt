Produced by [[Chuck Jones]] at [[MGM Animation/Visual Arts]], the film stars [[Butch Patrick]] as Milo, alongside the voice talents of [[Mel Blanc]], [[Daws Butler]], [[Candy Candido]], [[Hans Conried]], [[June Foray]], Patti Gilbert, [[Shepard Menken]], [[Cliff Norton]], [[Larry Thor]], and [[Les Tremayne]]. Jones also co-directed the film with [[Abe Levitow]], while Dave Monahan directed the live-action segments.\n\nCompleted in 1968, the film was held up from release by MGM until late 1970 due to internal studio problems. The animation studio closed soon after the film's release, with MGM leaving the animation business for good. Juster had no input into the adaptation, and has expressed his hatred for the film in an interview: \"It was a film I never liked. I don't think they did a good job on it. It's been around for a long time. It was well reviewed, which also made me angry.\"<ref>{{cite web|last1=Stone|first1=RoseEtta|title=An Interview with Norton Juster, Author of The Phantom Tollbooth|url=https://www.underdown.org/juster.htm|website=Writing, Illustrating, and Publishing Children's Books: The Purple Crayon|access-date=15 February 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n{{more plot|date=May 2016}}\nMilo, a bored boy who lives in a [[San Francisco]] apartment block, is surprised by a large, gift-wrapped package that has appeared in his room.  The package turns out to be a tollbooth which is a gateway into a magical parallel universe. As Milo uses the tollbooth's toy car to pass through the tollbooth, the character moves from live action to animation, and after getting accustomed to this he drives further, and is transported to the enchanted Kingdom of Wisdom in the Lands Beyond.\n\nAccompanied by Tock, a \"watchdog\" who actually has a large pocketwatch in his body, Milo has a series of adventures in places like the Doldrums, Dictionopolis (Kingdom of Words), Digitopolis (Kingdom of Mathematics), the Mountains of Ignorance, and the Castle in the Air. Together, they must rescue the Princesses of Sweet Rhyme and Pure Reason, who are being held captive in the Castle in the Air, and restore order to the Kingdom of Wisdom. The many eccentric characters they meet include the Whether Man, the Humbug, the Spelling Bee, the noisy Dr. Kakofonous A. Dischord, King Azaz the Unabridged, the Mathemagician, Faintly Macabre the Not-So-Wicked Which, Chroma the Great, and Officer Short Shrift as well as demons like the Senses Taker, the Terrible Trivium, the Demon of Insincerity, and the Gelatinous Giant.\n\n==Cast==\n{{main|List of The Phantom Tollbooth characters}}\n* [[Butch Patrick]] as Milo\n* [[Michael Earl (puppeteer)|Mike Davis]] as Friend (uncredited)\n* [[Chuck Jones]] as Cable Car Passenger (uncredited cameo)\n\n===Voices===\n* [[Mel Blanc]] as Officer Short Shrift, The Dodecahedron, The Demon of Insincerity, The Letter Vendor, Ministers, Lethargians, The Overbearing Know-It-All\n* [[Daws Butler]] as The Whether Man, The Senses Taker, The Terrible Trivium, The Gelatinous Giant\n* [[Candy Candido]] as The Awful DYNNE\n* [[Hans Conried]] as King Azaz the Unabridged, The Mathemagician\n* [[June Foray]] as Ralph, The Princess of Pure Reason, Faintly Macabre the Not-So-Wicked Which\n* Patti Gilbert as The Princess of Sweet Rhyme\n* [[Shepard Menken]] as The Spelling Bee, Chroma the Great\n* [[Cliff Norton]] as Dr. Kakofonous A.

For his first project with [[MGM Animation/Visual Arts]], Jones read the book ''[[The Dot and the Line]]'' written by [[Norton Juster]], which was adapted into an animated short that won the [[Academy Award for Animated Short Film]]. In January 1966, MGM optioned to adapt ''The Phantom Tollbooth'' into a feature-length film. Jones remarked, \"It was a natural progression to another Juster work. On this one Les Goldman and Abe Levitow are my co-producers. Levitow and I are directing and [[Maurice Noble]] is production designer.\" Early into development, it was decided that the first few scenes of Milo would be filmed in live-action before transitioning into animation.<ref>{{cite news|last=Scott|first=John|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/21562842/the_los_angeles_times/|title='Phantom Tollbooth' Film on the Drawing Board|page=[https://www.newspapers.com/clip/21562832/the_los_angeles_times/ 2]|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=January 25, 1968|access-date=November 29, 2019|via=[[Newspapers.com]]}} {{Open access}}</ref>\n\nIn a departure from the novel, Ralph was added to the film to act as a friend to Milo.
