The film stars Shepard as Officer Jon Baker and [[Michael Pe\u00f1a]] as Frank \"Ponch\" Poncherello, with [[Rosa Salazar]], [[Adam Brody]] and [[Vincent D'Onofrio]] in supporting roles.\n\n[[Principal photography]] began on 21 October 2015, in [[Los Angeles]]. The film was released on 24 March 2017, by [[Warner Bros. Pictures]] and grossed $26 million worldwide. It has a 18% approval rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]], which called it \"only mildly arresting at best\".\n\nUnlike the original series, the movie was produced without the cooperation of the [[California Highway Patrol]] (CHP) and without a license to use CHP logos.\n\n==Plot==\nIn the city of Miami, Agent Castillo of the [[FBI]], takes down a crew of bank robbers. At the same time, former [[motocross]] racer Jon Baker enrolls in the [[California Highway Patrol]] Academy. Despite his low aptitude score across every field, Sgt. Gail Hernandez sympathizes with Jon, noting that he can ride a motorcycle better than the majority of cadets she has trained and grants him a probationary graduation.\n\nOn a California highway, a crew of bike riders attacks an [[armored car (valuables)|armored van]]. One member, \"LT\", accuses the guard and his CHP [[closeted|closet boyfriend]] TJ of stealing from him. As punishment, LT informs TJ over the police frequency that he must choose who lives; he or his boyfriend. TJ ultimately kills himself.\n\nIn Miami, Castillo is informed that the CHP have requested the FBI's help in the armored van heist, believing that a corrupt police ring is involved. Given the alias Francis Llewellyn \"Ponch\" Poncherello, Ponch is partnered up with Baker, before ostensibly paying their respects to TJ's widow at home. Baker notes that there isn't a single commendation, picture or other effects a helicopter pilot would have in the house and precisely identifies the bikes used in the heist as the [[Ducati Hypermotard|Ducati Hypermotard 939]]. The bike gang makes another attempt on an armored van. The crew evade Ponch and Baker on the faster Ducatis after a lengthy chase through [[Elysian Park, Los Angeles|Elysian Park]]. LT, wary of Ponch's extensive investigations into the heists finds out from his FBI contacts that he is undercover, whereas Ponch also obtains a potential lead on an apartment TJ tenanted at and concludes that TJ had to have been corrupt as it would not have been affordable on his salary. Sensing that something is still amiss, Ponch and Baker re-visit TJ's home. Though getting involved in a fight with Parish, Ponch recognizes that he is not in on the corrupt circle, after he suggests that \"LT\" in reality could stand for [[Lieutenant]]. They later arrive on the profile of Lieutenant Raymond Kurtz and whilst suspect him have no evidence to pin him to the heists.\n\nThe FBI pick up on a promising lead to a [[drug house]] in [[Venice, California|Venice]], prompting Ponch and Baker to respond. During a lengthy pursuit with one of the crew members, Officer Brian Grieves secretly informs LT that the suspect involved is his son. While crossing a bridge, the suspect is [[decapitation|decapitated]] by a recovery vehicle's extended industrial wire. LT arrives and crashes into Baker who was in pursuit. Parish arrives in his police helicopter and airlifts an unconscious Baker to hospital.\n\nPetersen fires Ponch for disobeying his orders to stay well away from the FBI's lead. Baker also discovers that his ex-wife Karen who Baker had been living with has sold her house while he was in hospital without telling him. At Ponch's house, Baker identifies the decapitated biker as Raymond Reed Kurtz Jr, connecting him to CHP Lieutenant Ray Kurtz's son and confirming their earlier suspicions. Ray kidnaps Karen and holds her hostage at his safe house but both Ponch and Baker rescue Karen as Officer Ava Perez arrives with back up but are attacked by Ray's associates.\n\nRay shoots off three of Ponch's fingers, leaving him unable to return fire and instead relies on Baker's poor aim to retaliate. Altering his aim to compensate, Baker accidentally detonates an explosive device that incapacitates Ray and his remaining guards, who Perez and the other Officers arrest. Ray comes to, but is reinforced by Officer Lindsey Taylor and then holds Baker at gunpoint. Ponch intervenes moments before Ray fires a shot into Baker's arm which ricochets off of a [[prosthetic implant|titanium implant]] and strikes Ray in the head, killing him instantly.\n\nBaker is loaded onto an ambulance to be treated for his injuries. Karen offers to join him in hospital, however Baker finally realizes how little she cares for him and declines her offer. Ponch is given [[morphine]] by a paramedic. A final scene shows Castillo receiving a call from Peterson, who offers him his job back at the FBI. Castillo however refuses, preferring to stay in the CHP.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Michael Pe\u00f1a]] as FBI Agent Castillo and [[California Highway Patrol]] Officer Francis Llewellyn \"Ponch\" Poncherello.\n* [[Dax Shepard]] as [[California Highway Patrol]] Officer Jonathan \"Jon\" Baker.\n* [[Vincent D'Onofrio]] as [[California Highway Patrol]] Lieutenant Raymond Kurtz.\n* [[Rosa Salazar]] as [[California Highway Patrol]] Officer Ava Perez.\n* [[Jessica McNamee]] as [[California Highway Patrol]] Officer Lindsey Taylor.\n* [[Adam Brody]] as Special Agent Clay Allen.\n* [[Ryan Hansen]] as [[California Highway Patrol]] Officer Brian Grieves. \n* [[Isiah Whitlock Jr.]] as Special Agent Peterson.\n* [[Richard T.

In a 2002 episode of ''[[MADtv]]'', Valderrama and fellow ''[[That '70s Show]]'' cast member [[Danny Masterson]] were featured in two parodies of ''CHiPs'', which featured the two actors as Ponch and Baker respectively. [[Mila Kunis]] also appeared in the second sketch. In a 2002 episode of ''That '70s Show'', Valderrama's character, Fez, was seen in the \"most likely\" section of the yearbook as \"most likely to appear as Ponch in a musical version of ''CHiPs''\".\n\nThe project began as a personal film that [[Dax Shepard]] wanted to do: a motor sports comedy starring him and [[Michael Pena]], and a tribute to the ''[[CHiPs]]'' television series. In an interview with [[Vulture (website)|Vulture]], Shepard said:\n\n{{quote|text=...I\u2019m always looking for something that will hold both comedy and motor sports. I\u2019m looking for anything that I think I can combine those two things and that someone will make... I couldn\u2019t have gone into any studio and said, \u201cThe movie\u2019s called, uh, ''Eat My Dust''\u201d \u2014 well, that\u2019s actually a title \u2014 \u201c''Burn Rubber,'' and it\u2019s me and Michael Pe\u00f1a, and we\u2019re on motorcycles.\u201d They\u2019d go, \u201cNo thank you.\u201d It had to have a safety net, and the safety net I found was ''CHiPs'', which as a kid I saw it, I was 2 when it came on originally and I think I was 8 when it went off the air... I lived in [[Detroit, MI|Detroit]] and it was cold and cloudy every day, and you\u2019d turn this show on and for an hour you were in [[California]], and it was beaches and palm trees and this weird pair on motorcycles, and as a kid, I was in. I didn\u2019t follow any of the plotlines, and I didn\u2019t know what the show was about, but it just had California and motorcycles. I thought, this could hold a ''[[Bad Boys (1995 film)|Bad Boys]]'' version of the movie, because your heroes have motorcycles, so it\u2019s got an inherent coolness if we just keep pushing in that direction.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vulture.com/2017/03/dax-shepard-on-why-he-made-a-chips-movie.html|publisher=[[Vulture (magazine)|Vulture]]|accessdate=September 1, 2018|title=Dax Shepard on Motorcycles, Michael Pe\u00f1a, and Why He Made a CHiPs Movie|author=Kevin Lincoln|date=March 27, 2017}}</ref>}}\n\nOn September 2, 2014, [[Warner Bros.]] announced a film adaptation of the 1977\u20131983 TV series ''CHiPs'' created by [[Rick Rosner]], Andrew Panay would be producing along with Shepard.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Fleming|first1=Mike Jr.|title=Dax Shepard Driving Warner Bros \u2018CHiPS' Film; Michael Pena To Play Ponch|url=https://deadline.com/2014/09/chips-movie-remake-dax-shepard-michael-pena-warner-bros-828037/|accessdate=September 3, 2014|work=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|publisher=[[Penske Media Corporation]]|location=United States|date=September 2, 2014}}</ref> Shepard also wrote, directed and starred in the film.<ref name=\"Sheppard\"/> It was announced that Panay would produce the film through his Panay Films along with Ravi Mehta.<ref name=BellCast/> In August 2015, the film was selected by the [[California Film Commission]] to receive $5.1 million in tax credits.<ref>{{cite news|last1=McNary|first1=Dave|title=California Film Tax Credits Go to \u2018Conjuring 2,' \u2018Chicken Soup for the Soul'|url=https://variety.com/2015/film/news/california-film-tax-credits-go-to-conjuring-2-chicken-soup-for-the-soul-1201572506/|accessdate=September 7, 2015|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|publisher=[[Penske Media Corporation]]|location=[[Los Angeles]]|date=August 18, 2015}}</ref>\n\n[[Steven Mnuchin]] was the [[executive producer]] of ChiPs.\n\n===Filming===\n[[Principal photography]] on the film began on October 21, 2015, in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]],<ref>{{cite news|title=On the Set 10/22/15: Tom Hiddleston Starts on \u2018Kong: Skull Island, Nina Dobrev Starts on \u2018Crash Pad'|url=http://www.ssninsider.com/on-the-set-102215-tom-hiddleston-starts-on-kong-skull-island-nina-dobrev-starts-on-crash-pad/|accessdate=October 25, 2015|work=SSN Insider|publisher=Alex Amin|location=[[Los Angeles]]|date=October 23, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151025235428/http://www.ssninsider.com/on-the-set-102215-tom-hiddleston-starts-on-kong-skull-island-nina-dobrev-starts-on-crash-pad/|archive-date=October 25, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Perry|first1=Spencer|title=Photos from the Set of the CHiPs Remake!|url=https://www.comingsoon.net/movies/news/632133-photos-from-the-set-of-the-chips-remake#/slide/6|accessdate=November 15, 2015|work=[[CraveOnline#Owned or associated websites|Coming Soon]]|publisher=Evolve Media, LLC.|location=[[Los Angeles]]|date=November 12, 2015}}</ref> utilizing many of the same sections of Southern California freeways used for the original television series, notably [[Interstate 210 and State Route 210 (California)|Interstate 210]] in [[La Crescenta, California]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\n===Casting===\nIn September 2014, Warner Bros. announced that Shepard would write, direct, and star in the film as Officer Jon Baker, and that [[Michael Pe\u00f1a]] would portray Frank \"Ponch\" Poncherello.<ref name=\"Sheppard\">{{cite news|last1=Couch|first1=Aaron|title=Dax Shepard Making 'CHiPS' Movie for Warner Bros.|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/dax-shepard-making-chips-movie-729677|accessdate=September 3, 2014|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|publisher=[[Prometheus Global Media]]|location=[[Los Angeles]]|date=September 2, 2014}}</ref> In May 2015, [[Vincent D'Onofrio]] was announced to be playing a former cop turned car thief and gang-leader.<ref name=OnofrioCast>{{cite news|last1=Kit|first1=Borys|title='CHiPs' Movie Casting Vincent D'Onofrio as Villain (Exclusive)|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/chips-movie-casting-vincent-donofrio-797996|accessdate=June 2, 2015|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|publisher=[[Prometheus Global Media]]|location=[[Los Angeles]]|date=May 26, 2015}}</ref> In September, [[Adam Brody]] joined the film to play an officer, while [[Rosa Salazar]]  and Shepard's wife [[Kristen Bell]] also signed on to star.<ref name=BrodyCast>{{cite news|last1=Kroll|first1=Justin|title=Adam Brody Joins Dax Shepard in Warner Bros.'
