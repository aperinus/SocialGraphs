The film is directed by [[Adam Wingard]] and written by Charles and Vlas Parlapanides, and [[Jeremy Slater]]. The film stars [[Nat Wolff]], [[Lakeith Stanfield]], [[Margaret Qualley]], [[Shea Whigham]], [[Paul Nakauchi]], Jason Liles, and [[Willem Dafoe]], and follows the story of an American high school student named [[Light Yagami|Light Turner]] (portrayed by Wolff) who finds a mysterious supernatural notebook known as the \"Death Note\", which can kill anyone whose name is written in its pages, using it to murder criminals, while a secretive detective only known as [[L (Death Note)|L]] (portrayed by Stanfield) seeks to find him.\n\n''Death Note'' was screened at [[London FrightFest Film Festival|FrightFest]] in London and was subsequently released on [[Netflix]] on August 25, 2017, receiving mixed reviews from critics. A sequel is in development, with [[Greg Russo (screenwriter)|Greg Russo]] attached to write the screenplay.\n\n== Plot ==\nIn [[Seattle, Washington]], high schooler [[Light Yagami|Light Turner]] stumbles across the \"Death Note,\" a mysterious leather-bound notebook with instructions that state that by writing a person's name down within it, that person will die in the manner prescribed. Light meets the [[Shinigami|death god]] [[Ryuk (Death Note)|Ryuk]], the notebook's owner. Ryuk convinces Light to use the notebook; Light writes down a bully's name and shortly thereafter witnesses him being killed in a freak accident. That night, Light tries it again, using the name of his mother's killer, Anthony Skomal, and learns the next morning from his father James, a police detective, that Skomal died as Light had written. At school, Light shows Mia the book and demonstrates its power by killing a known criminal felon during a televised hostage situation. The two decide to work together to rid the world of criminals and terrorists, using the name \"Kira\" (derived from the Japanese trans-literation for \"Killer,\" so as to direct investigative attention away from their continent).\n\nKira's actions draw the attention of enigmatic international detective \"[[L (Death Note)|L]],\" who deduces Kira is a Seattle-based student with close ties to the police and indirectly concludes Kira can only kill by knowing the name and face of their victim. Working with James and the police, L has several FBI agents track Light and other suspects. Light refuses to kill them when Mia suggests it, but soon the agents commit mass suicide, which Light believes Ryuk made them do. James threatens Kira over public broadcast but when he fails to be killed, L confronts Light about being Kira and prepares the police to thoroughly search Light's home. Light decides to use the Death Note to force L's personal assistant Watari to travel to [[Montauk, New York]] and find L's adoption record there; Light plans to burn the notebook page with Watari's name once he knows L's name to stop Watari's death, then kill L. Mia helps to sneak the notebook out before the search.\n\nLight and Mia go to the school dance, using the event to ditch L and the police. Light recovers the notebook just as Watari contacts him with L's name from the orphanage he was raised in, but Light cannot find the page in the notebook where Watari's name is written. Watari is then killed by security for trespassing before he can reveal L's name. Light discovers Mia took Watari's page, caused the agents' suicide, and has written Light's name in the book, set to kill him at midnight, but she offers to burn his page if he turns the notebook over to her. Light flees, telling Mia to meet him at the [[Seattle Great Wheel]]. Meanwhile, L learns of Watari's death and becomes unstable, leaving on a personal manhunt against Light, while James orders L to be detained. L corners Light, but a Kira Supporter, hearing that Light is Kira, knocks L out, letting Light escape. Mia meets Light at the wheel and they ride to the top. There, Mia steals the notebook, but realizes too late this was Light's plan: Light has written her death in the notebook contingent on her taking it. Ryuk then makes the wheel collapse, sending Mia falling to her death, while Light and the notebook fall into the nearby waters. The page with Light's name lands in a burning barrel in front of L's eyes.\n\nPrior to meeting Mia, Light had used the book to coerce a criminally-charged doctor to rescue him and put him into a medically-induced coma, while having another criminal recover the Death Note and continue Kira's killings before returning the book to his bedside, killing both after their role is complete. Meanwhile, L is ordered off the case for his apparent misconduct, but in defiance, he raids Mia's home, finds the notebook page with the agents' names and deduces its capabilities. In a hysterical fit, he considers writing a name (implied to be Light's). When Light wakes from his coma at a hospital with James, who has come to conclude Light is Kira, by his side, he tries to convince James that his actions were \"the lesser of two evils,\" prompting Ryuk to laugh and comment that \"humans are so interesting.\"\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Nat Wolff]] as [[Light Yagami|Light Turner / Kira]]: <br>A bright yet isolated high-school student who discovers the titular \"Death Note\" and uses it to kill criminals by writing their names and causes of death, in a bid to change the world into a utopia without crime, and thus, alongside Mia Sutton, becoming the world-famous serial killer known as \"Kira\", while being both praised and feared by law enforcement agencies and the worldwide media and public. In stark contrast to his manga counterpart, this version of Light lacks much of the original's ruthless, sadistic and sociopathic tendencies and is depicted in a more sympathetic and humanized light. \n* [[Lakeith Stanfield]] as [[L (Death Note)|L]]:<br> A nameless, highly-intelligent and esteemed\u2014but also socially eccentric and quirky\u2014international consulting detective with a past shrouded in mystery and who is determined to capture \"Kira\" and end his reign of terror.\n* [[Margaret Qualley]] as [[Light Yagami|Mia Sutton / Kira]]:<br> Light's classmate and girlfriend, who assists him in his worldwide massacre of criminals as the god-like vigilante: \"Kira\", eventually seeking to kill those who seek to stop them and becoming dangerously obsessed with the book's power. In an interview with [[io9]], [[Adam Wingard]] revealed that rather than being based on the manga character [[Misa Amane]], Sutton is an original character based on the sociopathic qualities of [[Light Yagami]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://io9.gizmodo.com/why-netflixs-death-note-is-really-an-origin-story-and-w-1798435941|title=Why Netflix's Death Note Is Really an Origin Story and Where a Sequel Could Go|last=Trendacosta|first=Katharine|work=io9|date=August 28, 2017|access-date=September 10, 2017}}</ref>\n* [[Shea Whigham]] as [[List of Death Note characters#Soichiro Yagami|Detective James Turner]]: <br>Light's widowed father and a veteran Seattle police detective, who assists L in finding the mysterious \"Kira\", unaware that he is his own son.
