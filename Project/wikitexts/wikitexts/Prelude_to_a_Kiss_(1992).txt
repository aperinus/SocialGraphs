The movie follows a conservative man Peter (Baldwin) and a liberal woman Rita (Ryan) falling in love. On their wedding day, Rita (who fears life's uncertainties and is cynical of the world) is kissed by an elderly stranger named Julius (Walker), causing their souls to switch places. Peter realizes the change and reunites with Rita, now in the form of an elderly man. While trying to figure out how to restore his wife, Peter tries to connect with Rita despite her new form.\n\nThe movie is based on the [[Prelude to a Kiss (play)|1988 play of the same title]] that was also directed by Norman Ren\u00e9 and written by playwright [[Craig Lucas]], who adapted the film's screenplay. Alec Baldwin and Debra Monk were part of the cast in the play's worldwide premiere in New York City as well as the film cast, though while Baldwin reprised the same part, Monk played a new role. The title is taken from the 1938 [[torch song]] of the [[Prelude to a Kiss (song)|same title]] by [[Duke Ellington]]. Regarding the movie's story, critic James Hebert wrote: \"When it [the play] premiered in 1990, it was widely presumed to be an oblique response to the ravages of AIDS. Long removed from that time, it becomes a broader commentary on eternal topics like the limits of love and the meaning of commitment.\"<ref>Hebert, James.[http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/features/20080422-9999-1c22kiss.html \"Lucas' 'Prelude to a Kiss' gets a nimble staging in Carlsbad\"], Union-Tribune, San Diego, April 22, 2008.</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nPeter Hoskins, a conservative and self-conscious employee of a [[Chicago]] publishing house, attends a party. He meets Rita Boyle, a liberal, seemingly free-spirited part-time bartender who wants to be a graphic designer. They begin a relationship and fall in love. Peter finds himself experiencing greater confidence and optimism with Rita. Falling in love with him, Rita reveals her carefree attitude hides a pessimistic fear of the world. She is afraid to invest too much joy in life when things can go wrong and people can be cruel. For these reasons, she refuses to be a mother and bring children into an unjust world.\n\nOn their wedding day, minutes after taking their vows, Rita and Peter are approached by Julius Blier, an elderly man who requests a kiss with the bride. Charmed, Rita agrees. As they kiss, their spirits switch places. Now in an elderly body, a confused and disoriented Rita wanders off, eventually going to the address on Julius' ID. \"Rita\" and Peter leave for their honeymoon in Jamaica. He realizes his wife's personality and knowledge have changed, a suspicion cemented when \"Rita\" eagerly suggests they have children together. After they return home, \"Rita\" seems back to her old self. When they kiss, Peter is certain this is an impostor, realizing this person simply read Rita's diary to improve the masquerade.\n\nPeter goes to the bar where Rita worked, finding the old man Julius. A conversation confirms \"Julius\" is the real Rita. Peter hopes to switch their souls again, but discovers Julius/\"Rita\" has left to stay with her parents the Boyles, telling them there are problems with the marriage and separation is needed. They refuse to let Peter see \"Rita\", taking her in.\n\nMeeting Julius' daughter Leah, Peter learns the elderly man's wife passed away and now has terminal cancer, and only has a year to live. While trying to figure out what to do next, Rita and Peter live together, attempting to adjust to their new situation. The entire experience leads Rita to conclude life is precious and its finite nature can be appreciated rather than feared. Peter, who wondered how he could stay married when he is no longer sexually attracted to his wife, now sees beyond the physical shell and realizes he truly loves the soul within. Meanwhile, the novelty has worn off for Julius'  experiences and obligations of Rita's life, missing his family and independence.\n\nPeter convinces Rita's mother to bring \"Rita\" to him, saying he wants to fix the marriage. Sympathizing, Mrs. Boyle does so, leaving them alone. Rita and Peter then attempt to force a soul switch again, but Julius admits he doesn't know how it happened in the first place. He came across their wedding while wandering and found himself envious of the bride's youth, as he greatly feared dying. Rita realizes she and Julius both experienced fear and envy at the same moment. While he wanted to be young again, Rita saw him and envied him being an old person who had already survived any obstacle life might create. As Julius and Rita realize they no longer have the fears and envy they experienced that day, they magically return to their rightful bodies. Julius says goodbye as Rita and Peter determine to never take each other for granted and cherish their time together.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Alec Baldwin]] as Peter Hoskins\n* [[Meg Ryan]] as Rita Boyle\n* [[Sydney Walker]] as Julius Blier\n* [[Kathy Bates]] as Leah Blier\n* [[Ned Beatty]] as Dr. Boyle\n* [[Patty Duke]] as Mrs. Boyle\n* [[Stanley Tucci]] as Taylor\n* [[Debra Monk]] as Aunt Dorothy\n* [[Rocky Carroll]] as Tom\n* [[Fern Persons]] as Elderly Woman\n* [[Annie Golden]] as Tin Market Musician\n* Mary Spaeth as Palm Reader\n\n==Production ==\nThe film's title is derived from the [[Duke Ellington]]/[[Irving Gordon]]/[[Irving Mills]] tune of the same name, which is heard performed by [[Debbie Harry|Deborah Harry]] during the opening credits. The [[Film soundtrack|soundtrack]] also includes the [[Cole Porter]] song \"Every Time We Say Goodbye\" performed by [[Annie Lennox]], \"The More I See You\" and \"I Had the Craziest Dream\" by [[Harry Warren]] and [[Mack Gordon]], \"A Certain Smile\" by [[Sammy Fain]] and [[Paul Francis Webster]], \"[[The Very Thought of You]]\" by [[Ray Noble (musician)|Ray Noble]], \"Sweet Jane\" by the [[Cowboy Junkies]], and  \"Someone Like You\" by [[Van Morrison]].

This ''Prelude to a Kiss'' is not only without charm and wit, but it's also clumsily set forth: many people seeing it may wonder what, in heaven's name, is going on. The opened-up film lumbers like someone on crutches. Against the literal surroundings of Chicago, the North Shore and Jamaica, Peter, Rita and Julius become perfunctory characters, interesting only for the bizarre situation in which they are caught. They lack any convincing particularity or idiosyncrasy. The same dialogue that served well enough on the stage now sounds arch and coy or metaphysically flat.\"<ref>{{cite web | title = Prelude to a Kiss (1992) Review/Film; A Kiss Turns Into the Unexpected | author = Vincent Canby | date = July 10, 1992 | url = https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9E0CE1DC163DF933A25754C0A964958260 | work = The New York Times }}</ref>\n\n[[Roger Ebert]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' said of the film, \"[A]lthough it could probably do more with its story, what it does is gentle and moving. The film is fairly hard to categorize, which is one of its strengths. Of the dialogue, I'll say how unusual it is for Hollywood characters to talk longingly and thoughtfully about our search for happiness in this world where most assuredly we will die. ''Prelude to a Kiss'' is the kind of movie that can inspire long conversations about the only subject really worth talking about, the meaning of it all. The emotional heart of the movie belongs to the old guy, Walker, a New York stage actor who got his first starring role at 71. He is wonderful here. He begins as a block of human wood, an old man who looks as if he has not one single thing to say, and then he develops eloquently into a person of poetry and longing. He is, in many of his scenes, literally playing a woman in her 20s. How he does it \u2013 how he gets away with it \u2013 is through not just craft, but heart.\"<ref>{{cite web | date = | author = [[Roger Ebert]] | url = http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19920710/REVIEWS/207100301/1023 | work = Chicago Sun-Times | title = Review }}</ref>\n\nIn ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', [[Peter Travers]] stated, \"Craig Lucas's prince of a play has been turned into a toad of a movie. The disappointment is rending, since Lucas and director Norman Ren\u00e9 made magic onstage. The play challenges us to make an imaginative leap into the wild blue.

I'm afraid it's because the play itself is a whimsically inept piece of high [[kitsch]] \u2013 a ''[[The Twilight Zone|Twilight Zone]]'' for [[yuppie]] soft-heads. The characters aren't fleshed out as human beings; they seem like urban types concocted in screenwriting class. And so the ethereality of the premise never takes hold.\"<ref>{{cite web | date = July 17, 1992 | author = Owen Gleiberman | url = http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,311081,00.html | work = Entertainment Weekly | title = review }}</ref>\n\nIn ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'', Todd McCarthy observed, \"Thanks to a magnetic cast and intelligent adaptation, ''Prelude to a Kiss'' has made a solid transfer from stage to screen. Back in the 1930s or '40s, this sort of sophisticated, literary-oriented treatment of a simple romantic idea would have been the norm. Today's general audiences, however, may be put off by the quick-witted talk and mildly confused by the central device, despite its resemblance to ''[[Ghost (1990 film)|Ghost]]'' ... Baldwin and Ryan make such a winning pair. Looking great and playing a normal guy whose optimism has prevailed over his troubled past, Baldwin is a romantic lead both men and women can enjoy watching. Cuter-than-cute, almost too adorable for words, Ryan rambunctiously embodies the life force even when playing a basically aimless young woman, and the film suffers during her prolonged absence in the later stages.\"<ref>{{cite web | date = July 9, 1992 | author = Todd McCarthy | url = https://variety.com/review/VE1117901338/ | work =  Variety | title = Prelude to a Kiss }}</ref>\n\nRita Kempley of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' said, \"Packed with cheap sentiment and puerile romanticism, ''Prelude to a Kiss'' oozes sugarcoated comfort as might a drugstore valentine crushed enthusiastically to the recipient's heaving bosom. A faithful adaptation of Craig Lucas's popular play, it proves a feast for love gourmands, especially those with an appetite for body-swapping.
