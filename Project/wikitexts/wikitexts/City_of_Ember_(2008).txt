Directed by [[Gil Kenan]] in his live-action directorial debut, the film stars [[Saoirse Ronan]], [[Harry Treadaway]], [[Bill Murray]], [[Mackenzie Crook]], [[Martin Landau]], [[Mary Kay Place]], [[Toby Jones]] and [[Tim Robbins]].\n\nProduced by [[Tom Hanks]] and [[Gary Goetzman]]'s [[Playtone]] and [[Walden Media]], ''City of Ember'' was theatrically released on October 10, 2008 by [[20th Century Fox]], two months after the release of the final book in the series, ''[[The Diamond of Darkhold]]''. The film received mixed reviews from critics and was a [[box office bomb]], grossing only $17.9 million against a budget of $55 million.\n\n==Plot==\nWhen an unspecified global catastrophe looms, an [[underground city]] known as Ember is constructed to shelter a large group of survivors. In addition, a small metal box intended for a future generation of Emberites is timed to open after 200 years. This box is entrusted to the Mayor of the City of Ember, and each Mayor passes it on to their successor. When the seventh Mayor dies suddenly, the succession is broken, and over time, the box's significance is forgotten. The box opens by itself at the allotted time, but it goes unnoticed. Several decades later, Ember's generator begins to fail, and food, medicine and other necessities are in dangerously short supply.\n\nAt a rite of passage event for all graduating students of Ember City School, Mayor Cole stands before the students as their adult occupations are assigned by lottery. Doon Harrow, the son of inventor and repairman Loris Harrow, is assigned \"Messenger\" while his classmate Lina Mayfleet is assigned \"Pipeworks\". Shortly afterwards, the two secretly exchange assignments and Doon is apprenticed to the elderly [[technician]] Sul. At home, Lina (a descendant of the seventh Mayor) finds the opened box and enlists Doon's help to decipher its contents. Gradually, they learn that it contains a set of instructions and directions for an exit from the city in the pipeworks.\n\nLater, after evading a gigantic [[star-nosed mole]], they also discover that Mayor Cole has been hoarding canned food in a secret vault for his own benefit while the people go hungry. When Lina attempts to report this, the Mayor captures her and tries to steal the box, but she escapes during a blackout. Now fugitives from the Mayor's police, Lina and Doon, accompanied by Lina's little sister Poppy, use the instructions and assistance from Sul to flee the city via a [[subterranean river]]. When the repercussions of their actions trigger a panic in Ember, the Mayor locks himself in his vault, only to be devoured by the giant mole.\n\nDoon, Lina and Poppy eventually reach the Earth's surface where they, for the first time in their lives, witness a sunrise. They also locate Ember in a hole in the ground, too far for them to call to anyone. So before they explore, they drop a letter with information on how to get out, tied to a rock, into Ember, where it is found by Loris.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Saoirse Ronan]] as Lina Mayfleet\n* [[Harry Treadaway]] as Doon Harrow\n* [[Bill Murray]] as Mayor Cole\n* [[Tim Robbins]] as Loris \"Barrow\" Harrow\n* [[Martin Landau]] as Sul\n* [[Toby Jones]] as Barton Snode\n* [[Marianne Jean-Baptiste]] as Clary Lane\n* [[Liz Smith (actress)|Liz Smith]] as Granny Mayfleet\n* Amy Quinn and Catherine Quinn as Poppy Mayfleet\n* [[Mary Kay Place]] as Mrs. Murdo\n* [[Mackenzie Crook]] as Looper\n* [[Lucinda Dryzek]] as Lizzie Bisco\n* Matt Jessup as Joss\n* [[Simon Kunz]] as Captain Fleury\n* [[Ian McElhinney]] as Builder\n\n==Production==\nIn October 2004, [[Tom Hanks]] and [[Gary Goetzman]] paid in the mid-six figures<ref>TCM [http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title.jsp?stid=665708&category=Misc%20Notes Misc. notes for The City of Ember]</ref> to purchase the film rights to [[Jeanne DuPrau]]'s 2003 novel ''[[The City of Ember]]''.

At only 95 minutes, the movie feels as though it had been shredded in the editing room... The best things about this are scenes of the ominous grinding machinery of the kind found in railway yards, as well as several zany gadgets worthy of [[Rube Goldberg]]. The wittiest is a primitive [[Answering machine|telephone-answering machine]] that resembles the do-it-yourself hi-fi kits assembled by audiophiles in the early days of stereo... Tim Robbins is also on hand as Doon's earnest, secretly rebellious father, who spends his days tinkering with exotic inventions... But not to worry: the boundless resourcefulness of two curious, clean-cut adolescents full of gee-whiz enthusiasm may lead humanity back into the fresh air and sunlight.\"<ref>{{cite news |last= Holden |first= Stephen |author-link= Stephen Holden |title= Fleeing a Dying Civilization, Toward Hope and Sunlight |work= [[The New York Times]] |location= New York |date= Oct 10, 2008 |page= C10}}</ref>\n\nJustin Chang of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' also gave the film a mixed review, calling the film \"A fabulously designed underground metropolis proves more involving than the teenagers running through its streets in ''City of Ember'', a good-looking but no more than serviceable adaptation of Jeanne Duprau's 2003 novel. Director Gil Kenan's disappointing live-action follow-up to his enjoyable toon debut, ''[[Monster House (film)|Monster House]]'', shows promising flickers of the visual invention throughout, but the dramatic sparks fail to ignite in this simple-minded exercise in juvenile dystopia.\" Chang also observed that the characters represent \"English-speaking, predominantly Caucasian humanity.\"<ref>{{cite journal |last= Chang |first= Justin |title= Eye-popping 'Ember' burns out |journal= [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |location= New York |publisher= Penske Business Media |volume= 412 |issue= 9 |date= Oct 13, 2008 |page= 39}}</ref>\n\nIrv Slifkin for ''Video Business'' wrote, \"this lavishly designed adventure saga from director Gil Kenan... plays like [[Terry Gilliam]]'s ''[[Brazil (1985 film)|Brazil]]'' \u2014 for beginners\". He praised the \"secret escape plan hidden by Ember's founders\" and \"impressive technical work,\" concluding that there were \"drama and sometimes lethargic pacing, but there's enough here for middle- and high-school kids to think about and marvel over.\"<ref>{{cite news |last= Slifkin |first = Irv |date= Dec 29, 2008 |title= City of Ember |publisher= Video Business |volume= 28 |number= 51 |page= 13}}</ref>\n\nCinema Blend's editor-in-chief, Katey Rich gave the film 2.5 of 5 stars and said, \"''The City of Ember'' belongs to one of the best and most enduring genres of children's films, in which smart kids stand up against the ignorant and aloof adult world and have a big adventure in the process. It also throws in a fantastical city, replete with whiz-bang inventions and secret societies. It's a mystery, then, that all the happy elements only add up to a big mush, a dull adventure, and a contrived fantasy. Saoirse Ronan is a fantastic heroine, but the story and the rest of the cast can't keep up with her lively pace.\" She added that \"director Gil Kenan seems hellbent on just driving the narrative forward. The movie clocks in at an acceptably short time for a kid's movie, but so much gets lost or glossed over along the way. Ember itself is fascinating, an intricately detailed set that, like [[Places in Harry Potter#Diagon Alley|Diagon Alley]] or the ''[[Star Wars]]'' cantina, you'd like to take a few hours to wander around in. But so many questions about the city are left unanswered... You get the feeling that Jeanne Duprau's book got into this stuff, while the movie never seems to have the time.\"<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.cinemablend.com/reviews/City-of-Ember-3413.html |last= Rich |first= Katey |title= ''City of Ember'' |publisher= Cinema Blend |access-date= September 8, 2013}}</ref>\n\n''[[TV Guide]]'' was more forgiving with 3.5 out of 4 stars, pointing out, \"A fun and moving family film with a subtly dark feel rarely seen in kids' movies since the '80s, ''City of Ember'' succeeds despite its shortcomings, not only because of its fun and inspiring story, but because most of its flaws are things kids won't notice anyway... [T]he story spins into a classic fable; the ignorance that seemed so blissful shows it's just one half of a coin, where the other side holds apathy and hopelessness. The moral might well be lost on kids, but for adults, it's compelling \u2014 all the more so because we like the good people of this dying city.\" This reviewer praised the \"series of exciting adventures\" and argued that \"Lina and Doon's vigilant sense of hope is, in the end, incredibly inspiring and extremely pertinent... It might be a staple theme in family films, but the ''City of Ember'' is a useful reminder about the power of the human spirit to triumph where our own hopelessly broken systems have failed. It's a message that the filmmakers didn't take for granted \u2014 and that hopefully viewers won't either\".<ref>{{cite magazine |url= http://movies.tvguide.com/city-of-ember/review/295108 |last= Albertson |first = Camila |year= 2008 |title= ''City Of Ember'': Review |magazine= [[TV Guide]] |access-date= September 8, 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Box office===\nOn its opening weekend, the film opened poorly at #11 at the US box office with US$3,129,473.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/weekend/chart/?view=&yr=2008&wknd=41&p=.htm |title=Box Office Weekend Grosses from 10/10/08 to 10/01/09 |publisher= Amazon.com |work = [[Box Office Mojo]] |access-date= 2008-10-26 }}</ref> As of February 20, 2010, the film has grossed US$17,929,684 worldwide, well below its US$55 million budget.<ref name=\"mojo\" />\n\n===Accolades===\n{{Anchor|Awards|Accolades|Awards and honors}} \nSaoirse Ronan was nominated for 2009 [[Irish Film and Television Award]] as \"Best Actress in a Lead Role in a Film\".<ref>IMDB [https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0970411/awards Awards]</ref> Art director Jon Billington and production designer [[Martin Laing (production designer)|Martin Laing]] were nominated for [[Satellite Award]]s in 2008 for their design of the film, as was [[Ruth Myers (costume designer)|Ruth Myers]] for her costume design.<ref>{{cite web |title= 2008 SATELLITE\u2122 Awards |publisher= International Press Academy |url= https://www.pressacademy.com/award_cat/2008/ |url-status= live |via= [[Wayback Machine]] |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20111117163101/http://www.pressacademy.com/satawards/awards2008.shtml |archive-date= 2011-11-17 }}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|0970411}}\n* {{Amg movie|399607}}\n\n{{Gil Kenan}}\n{{Tom Hanks}}\n{{Jeanne DuPrau}}\n\n[[Category:2008 films]]\n[[Category:2000s English-language films]]\n[[Category:2000s fantasy adventure films]]\n[[Category:2000s science fiction adventure films]]\n[[Category:American dystopian films]]\n[[Category:The City of Ember]]\n[[Category:American fantasy adventure films]]\n[[Category:Films set in the future]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Northern Ireland]]\n[[Category:Playtone films]]\n[[Category:Walden Media films]]\n[[Category:20th Century Fox films]]\n[[Category:Icon Productions films]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by Caroline Thompson]]\n[[Category:American post-apocalyptic films]]\n[[Category:Films produced by Tom Hanks]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Gil Kenan]]\n[[Category:Films produced by Gary Goetzman]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Andrew Lockington]]\n[[Category:Films based on American novels]]\n[[Category:Films based on science fiction novels]]\n[[Category:2000s American films]]"}]}}}}
