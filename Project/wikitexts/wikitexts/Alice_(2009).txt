Her father disappeared when she was ten, and she has spent much of her life looking for him. She invites her new boyfriend Jack Chase to dinner, but is shocked when he gives her a valuable-looking ring as a gift. Jack abruptly leaves, Alice following only to witness Jack being abducted by several men. A man (the White Rabbit) appears and finds out that Alice is in possession of the ring because he hears the click of the mechanical box that contains the ring opening behind her back. He manages to take the box from her, thinking the ring is still in it, but Alice had already quickly taken it out and resealed the box. The White Rabbit runs away and Alice chases him to find out where they had taken Jack, but falls through a giant looking glass and lands in Wonderland, which has evolved over the past 150 years. Mary Heart, the [[Queen of Hearts (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Queen of Hearts]] rules over Wonderland from the Happy Hearts Casino, where people from Alice's world (\"Oysters\") are taken to, sedated and play games in the casino, their positive emotions drained from them and turned into drug-like substances for the people of Wonderland to digest, keeping them under the Queen's control.\n\nAlice escapes her own capture, with the ring still in her possession. Identified as an \"Oyster\" by the tattoo she gains, Alice is taken to [[the Hatter|Hatter]], a member of the resistance seeking to free the Oysters from the Queen's control. Hatter takes Alice to ask [[Dodo (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Dodo]] to help save Jack, but Dodo refuses, until the Hatter reveals the ring Alice wears, which Dodo recognizes as the Stone of Wonderland, able to open the Looking Glass back to the human world. Alice flees when Dodo tries to kill her, Hatter accompanying her to the forest where they escape a [[jabberwocky|jabberwock]] and meet Charlie, a surviving [[White Knight (Through the Looking-Glass)|White Knight]], who fled a battle years ago where Wonderland's knights were wiped out by the Queen. The Queen has the White Rabbit executed, and has [[The Walrus and the Carpenter|the Walrus and Carpenter]] revive [[March Hare|Mad March]], her favorite assassin to track Alice.\n\nAlice deliberately allows Mad March to capture her, so she can negotiate with the Queen to free Jack in return for the ring, which Alice has hidden. Jack appears, revealed as the Queen's son and to already be engaged to the [[Duchess (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Duchess]]. However, Jack passes Alice her father's watch, implying he is alive and in Wonderland. Alice is put in the Truth Room, where [[Tweedledum and Tweedledee]] interrogate her to learn the ring's location, but she is freed by Hatter and Charlie, the trio escaping back to the forests, whilst Jack also escapes.  In hopes of aiding the resistance and returning Alice home, Hatter uses his connections to find someone who can bring them to [[Caterpillar (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Caterpillar]], leader of the resistance, using the ring as leverage.  To their surprise, the agent who arrives is Jack, revealing him as an agent of the resistance who had originally stolen the ring as part of a ploy to initiate a coup to overthrow the queen.  Trusting him, Alice retrieves the ring, and accompanies Jack to meet Caterpillar, who reveals that Alice's father is Carpenter, but he has no memory of her.  As the Carpenter has been crucial in process for extracting emotions for the Queen, Jack had deliberately approached Alice in hopes that she could help the Carpenter break away from the Queen's control. Just as the Carpenter shows signs of regaining memories, Mad March and his minions arrive, capturing Alice and Jack whilst Caterpillar escapes.\n\nReunited with her ring, the Queen decides to send Alice home and execute Jack. Hatter stages a rescue with Charlie but is captured by Mad March after Charlie loses his courage and flees. Charlie, after feeling guilty for deserting Hatter, uses the skeletons of the extinct White Knights as a distraction to trick the Hearts into believing they are under attack. After being tortured by Dr. Dum and Dee, Hatter kills Mad March and escapes. Alice escapes again, joining up with the Hatter to snap the Oysters out of their sedations and rally them to escape. Carpenter appears, having regained his memories, but is killed by Walrus. The Oysters' unpleasant emotions run high, causing the casino to start collapsing. Alice, Hatter, Jack, the Duchess and the Queen escape but Winston, the loyal [[King of Hearts (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|King of Hearts]] willingly perishes knowing his wife never loved him. With her followers no longer listening to or fearing her, the powerless Queen surrenders the Stone of Wonderland to Alice. Alice returns home, learning her experience may have been a dream when she awakens in hospital to find she had been found unconscious an hour after chasing Jack. However, the next day she discovers the \"construction worker\" who found her was Hatter. The two share a passionate kiss in front of a looking glass, as Carol stares in shock.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Caterina Scorsone]] as Alice\n* [[Andrew-Lee Potts]] as Hatter\n* [[Matt Frewer]] as Charlie the White Knight\n* [[Kathy Bates]] as Queen of Hearts\n* [[Philip Winchester]] as Jack Heart\n* [[Colm Meaney]] as King of Hearts\n* [[Tim Curry]] as Dodo\n* [[Harry Dean Stanton]] as Caterpillar\n* [[Timothy Webber (actor)|Timothy Webber]] as Robert Hamilton/Carpenter\n* [[Zak Santiago]] as 10 of Clubs\n* [[Charlotte Sullivan]] as Duchess\n* [[Alan Gray (actor)|Alan Gray]] as the White Rabbit\n* [[Eugene Lipinski]] as Doctors Dee and Dum\n* [[Nancy Robertson (actress)|Nancy Robertson]] as Dormouse\n* Tom Heaton as Duck\n* Eileen Barrett as Owl\n* [[Alek Diakun]] as Rat Catcher\n* Dave Ward as Walrus\n* [[Alessandro Juliani]] as 9 of Clubs\n* [[Teryl Rothery]] as Carol Hamilton\n* Geoff Redknap as Mad March\n* [[Natasha Calis]] as Looking Glass Girl\n\n==Reception==\n\nPaige Wiser of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' gave the show three of five stars, saying that it was \"charming, but not perfect.\"<ref>{{Cite web |last=Wiser |first=Paige. |url=http://blogs.suntimes.com/tv/2009/12/tv_review_syfys_alice_update.html |title=TV Review: SyFy's \"Alice\" update |publisher=[[Chicago Sun-Times]] |date=December 5, 2009 |access-date=December 15, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091207122218/http://blogs.suntimes.com/tv/2009/12/tv_review_syfys_alice_update.html |archive-date=December 7, 2009 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Randee Dawn from ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' also gave the program a mediocre review,<ref>{{Cite web|last=Dawn |first=Randee |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/tv-reviews/alice-tv-review-1004050787.story |title=Alice \u2013 TV Review |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |date=December 3, 2009 |access-date=December 15, 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091208140045/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/tv-reviews/alice-tv-review-1004050787.story |archive-date=December 8, 2009 }}</ref> and Nancy deWolf Smith of ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' said that \"despite...diversions and whiz-bang special effects, [''Alice''] drags at times.\"<ref>{{Cite web|last=Smith |first=Nancy deWolf |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704007804574573770499791830 |title=TNT's Men of a Certain Age and Syfy's Alice |publisher=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |date=December 4, 2009 |access-date=December 15, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091207092424/http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704007804574573770499791830.html |archive-date=December 7, 2009 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nMark A.
