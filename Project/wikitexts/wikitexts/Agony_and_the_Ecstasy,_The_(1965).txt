The film was partly based on [[Irving Stone]]'s 1961 [[The Agony and the Ecstasy (novel)|biographical novel of the same name]], and deals with the conflicts of Michelangelo and Pope Julius II during the 1508-1512 painting of the [[Sistine Chapel ceiling]]. It also features a soundtrack by prolific composers [[Alex North]] and [[Jerry Goldsmith]].<ref>Clemmensen, Christian. [http://www.filmtracks.com/composers/goldsmith.shtml Jerry Goldsmith (1929-2004) tribute] at [[Filmtracks.com]]. Retrieved 2011-04-14.</ref>\n\nThe film was shot in [[Todd-AO]] and [[Cinemascope]] versions. The Todd-AO version was used for the [[DVD]] release because of its superior picture quality.\n\n==Plot==\nThe film opens in documentary style, chronicling the work of [[Michelangelo Buonarroti]].\nIt then follows Michelangelo, a renowned sculptor of the [[Republic of Florence]] in the early [[16th century]], and shows him at work on large-scale sculptures near [[St. Peter's Basilica]]. When [[Pope Julius II]] commissions him to paint the Sistine Chapel, Michelangelo resists because he finds the ceiling's paneled layout of the [[Twelve Apostles]] uninspiring. Nonetheless, he is forced into taking the job. During the initial attempt, Michelangelo is discontented with the results, and destroys the [[fresco]]es. He flees to [[Carrara]], and then into the mountains where he finds inspiration from nature.\n\nMichelangelo returns and is allowed to paint the entire [[Vault (architecture)|vault]] in a variety of newly designed [[Bible|biblical]] scenes. The work proceeds nonstop, even with [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] in session, as months turn to years. Michelangelo's work is threatened when he collapses due to fatigue. He is nursed back to health by Contessina de' [[Medici]], daughter of his old friend [[Lorenzo de' Medici]]. After recovering, Michelangelo returns to work after learning he is at risk of being replaced by [[Raphael]].\n\nMeanwhile, the [[Papal States]] are threatened during the [[War of the League of Cambrai]]. Preparing for battle and having reached the limits of his patience, the Pope terminates Michelangelo's contract. Raphael, impressed with the work in progress, asks Michelangelo to show humility and finish the ceiling. Michelangelo travels to see the injured and weakened Pope, and pleads for him to restore the patronage. Though the Pope believes an invasion of Rome is inevitable, he raises the money needed to resume work on the ceiling.\n\nOne night, Michelangelo finds the ailing Pope inspecting the portrait of [[God in Christianity|God]] in ''[[The Creation of Adam]]'', which the Pope declares \"a proof of faith.\" He then collapses and becomes bedridden. Though everyone assumes that the Pope will die, Michelangelo goads him into having the will to live and to finish his work. The tide of war turns in favor of the Papal States, as allies pledge to assist the Pope.\n\nA Mass is held in which the congregation is shown the completed ceiling. After the ceremony, Michelangelo asks to begin carving [[Tomb of Pope Julius II|the Pope's tomb]]. Realizing he has a short time to live, the Pope agrees. Together, the men admire the masterpiece of the Sistine Chapel, until Pope Julius walks away and Michelangelo turns to look at the space behind the altar where he would later paint his ''[[Last Judgement (Michelangelo)|Last Judgement]]''.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Charlton Heston]] \u2013 [[Michelangelo Buonarroti]]\n* [[Rex Harrison]] \u2013 [[Pope Julius II]]\n* [[Diane Cilento]] \u2013 Contessina Antonia Romola de' [[Medici]]\n* [[Harry Andrews]] \u2013 [[Donato Bramante]]\n* [[Alberto Lupo]] \u2013 Duke of Urbino\n* [[Adolfo Celi]] \u2013 [[Pope Leo X|Giovanni de' Medici]]\n* [[Venantino Venantini]] \u2013 Paris De Grassis\n* John Stacy \u2013 [[Giuliano da Sangallo]]\n* [[Fausto Tozzi]] \u2013 Foreman\n* [[Maxine Audley]] \u2013 Woman\n* [[Tomas Milian]] \u2013 [[Raphael]]\n}}\n\n==Production==\nFilm rights to the novel were bought by [[20th Century Fox]]  for a reported $125,000.

During the production, Rex Harrison and Charlton Heston did not get along. (Reed and Heston had originally wanted [[Laurence Olivier]] for Pope Julius, but he was unavailable.) Twelve years later, while filming ''[[The Prince and the Pauper (1977 film)|The Prince and the Pauper]]'', Harrison completely avoided Heston.{{citation needed|date=March 2021}}\n\nAccording to his diary, Heston was interested in playing Michelangelo before any studios decided to produce the film. Once cast in the part, he was excited to act under Reed, who had directed ''[[The Third Man]]'' (1949). Heston felt that this would be the film to resurrect Reed's directorial reputation, describing it as having the best audience-preview responses of any film he had ever seen. However, it only did modest business at the box office.<ref>Ben Mankiewicz on Turner Classic Movies</ref>\n\n==Reception==\nThe film grossed around $4,000,000 during its US theatrical run in 1965.

Furthermore, he believed the script suffered from being \"wordy.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9E03E6DB1331E03BA1575AC0A9669D946491D6CF?|work=The New York Times|title=Michelangelo Firm Opens in N.Y.|access-date=June 30, 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn a 2013 retrospective review in ''[[The Guardian]]'', [[Alex von Tunzelmann]] noted that the film's \"intent to inform is laudable, but a fictional film should really be able to convey its subject without a lecture,\" and echoed Crowther's observation that \"the screenplay goes heavy on the dialogue, light on the action.\" She laments that the sex-less film fails to reveal \"the real Michelangelo's passions\" (particularly his reputed attraction to men), and concluded the film would have been more interesting \"if it were told with a lot more humour and a lot less prudishness.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2013/may/24/agony-and-the-ecstasy-reel-history|work=The Guardian|title=The Agony and the Ecstasy: more passion would've been less painful|access-date=June 30, 2016}}</ref>\n\nJames Plath of Movie Metropolis was more positive, saying that \"For some viewers, the agony will be watching Charlton Heston (over)act, and the ecstasy Rex Harrison.
