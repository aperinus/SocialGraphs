The film was written and directed by [[George A. Romero]] and stars [[Timothy Hutton]] as Thad Beaumont and George Stark, [[Amy Madigan]] as Liz Beaumont, [[Michael Rooker]] as Sheriff [[Alan Pangborn]], and [[Royal Dano]] in his final film.\n\n==Plot==\nAn author of highbrow literary novels, Thad Beaumont ([[Timothy Hutton]]), is better known for the bestselling murder mystery suspense-thrillers he writes under the [[pen name]] \"George Stark\". Beaumont wishes to retire the Stark name and symbolically buries Stark in a mock grave.\n\nHowever, Stark has mysteriously become a physical entity (also portrayed by Hutton) and begins terrorizing Beaumont's family and friends after he emerges from the grave. Stark then kills local photographer Homer Gamache and steals his truck. He also murders Thad's editor, agent, and his agent's ex-wife, and kills a man named Fred Clawson, who was trying to blackmail Thad for \"being a con artist that should not have written books under a false name\".\n\nWhen the police suspect Thad of murdering Gamache, he tries to convince [[Sheriff]] [[Alan Pangborn]] of [[Castle Rock (Stephen King)|Castle Rock, Maine]] that he had nothing to do with it. After putting an all-points bulletin on Clawson, who was accused of the death of Gamache, the New York police find him castrated and his throat slit. They find a message on the wall, written in Clawson's blood, \"The sparrows are flying again.\" Thad starts to think that he may have a psychic connection to the killer.\n\nWhile in his office, Thad begins to receive messages from Stark, and begins to worry about the next victim. He and his family start to receive threatening phone calls from Stark. Pangborn initially suspects the phone calls are a prank by Thad himself until Stark begins to describe how he is going to kill Thad's family, disturbing Pangborn.\n\nState Police find Homer Gamache's truck with Thad's fingerprints all over it. For some reason, Stark wants to live in the material world, after only appearing in a set of Thad's best selling books.  Thad writes, but he is not alone in suspecting something strange: Sheriff Pangborn is equally suspicious and continues investigating. Thad begins to realize that Stark is, in fact, his [[parasitic twin]] brother who died at \"childbirth.\"\n\nHis mother never told Thad about the twin, and he was completely unaware until a local doctor tells him that Stark was a fraternal twin that was living inside Thad's brain. (A scene in the film's start shows a developing [[fetus]] inside Beaumont's brain). Stark arrives, kills the doctor, and blames Thad for the crime. Thad's colleague Reggie realizes that Stark is an entity controlled by the books that Thad wrote and that Stark will do anything he can to stop Thad. Stark kidnaps Thad's wife Liz and his children, and makes a deal with Thad: finishing a book that depicts Stark living in the real world, or he will kill his family.\n\nWhile writing the book, Thad notices Stark is healing himself with his writings, as George started to deteriorate due to Thad not writing anymore books, causing Thad to absorb his sickness. Thad and Stark get into a fight, which ends with Thad stabbing Stark in the neck with a pencil. Sheriff Pangborn arrives and unties Liz, who says that Thad and Stark are upstairs. However, a huge flock of sparrows inexplicably comes and tears Stark apart, taking him to the land of the dead. The sparrows are agents of Death, that come to collect souls and carry them to their final destination. Thad and Liz are spared, and they, along with Pangborn, watch as the sparrows disappear into the night.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Timothy Hutton]] as Thad Beaumont and George Stark\n*[[Amy Madigan]] as Liz Beaumont\n*[[Michael Rooker]] as [[Alan Pangborn|Sheriff Alan Pangborn]]\n*[[Julie Harris (American actress)|Julie Harris]] as Reggie Delesseps\n*[[Robert Joy]] as Fred Clawson\n*[[Chelsea Field]] as Annie Pangborn\n*[[Royal Dano]] as Digger Holt\n*[[Rutanya Alda]] as Miriam Cowley\n*[[Beth Grant]] as Shayla Beaumont\n*[[Kent Broadhurst]] as Mike Donaldson\n*[[Tom Mardirosian]] as Rick Cowley\n*Glenn Colerider as Homer Gamache\n\n==Production==\nThe film was filmed in part at [[Washington & Jefferson College]], near [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]].<ref name=washjeff />  Notable in the film are the chapel in the [[Old Main (Washington & Jefferson College)|Old Main]], seen at the beginning of the film as Beaumont's classroom, and the office of the college [[chaplain]], used as Beaumont's office.<ref name=washjeff>{{Cite web| title = W&J Up Close| work = W&J Magazine| publisher = Washington & Jefferson College| date = Winter 2004| url = http://www.washjeff.edu/uploadedFiles/External_Relations/For_the_Media/win2004Magazine.pdf| access-date = 2010-04-19| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080409205756/http://www.washjeff.edu/uploadedFiles/External_Relations/For_the_Media/win2004Magazine.pdf|archive-date=2008-04-09}}</ref>  Members of the faculty and student body served as extras in the film.<ref name=winks>{{cite news | last =Winks | first =Michael | title =Romero kicks off star-studded \"Dark Half\" here | newspaper =[[The Pittsburgh Press]] | date =October 22, 1990 | url =https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=-N4cAAAAIBAJ&sjid=3GMEAAAAIBAJ&pg=6717,3728015 | access-date =August 27, 2012 }}</ref>\n\nThe residence featured in the film is a home located on Maple Avenue in the Edgewood neighborhood of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.\n\nThe film was Romero's third foray into filming with the support of a major film production company (after ''[[Creepshow]]'' and ''[[Monkey Shines (film)|Monkey Shines]]''), causing some problems for the notoriously low-budget director.<ref name=winks />\n\nThe film was shot from October 1990 until March 1991. It was not released for two years because of [[Orion Pictures]]' bleak financial situation at the time. The film eventually saw release in April 1993, taking in just over $10 million domestically.<ref>[https://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=darkhalf.htm The Dark Half (1993)<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\n==Reception==\nIn its opening week ''The Dark Half'' ranked in the box office charts at number 6, gathering a total of $3,250,883 from 1,563 theatres.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://boxofficemojo.com/weekend/chart/?yr=1993&wknd=17&p=.htm|title=Domestic 1993 Weekend 17}}</ref>\n\nCritics gave the film mixed reviews, though they praised [[Timothy Hutton]]'s performance in the film as well as the screenplay. On [[Rotten Tomatoes]], it currently holds a 59% from 34 reviews with an average score of 5.9/10. The critics consensus reads, \u201d''The Dark Half'' is a highly serious psychological study that can be faulted for being more curious than actually scary.\u201d <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/dark_half/|title=The Dark Half (1993)|work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|access-date=February 23, 2022}}</ref>\n\n[[Roger Ebert]] gave the film two out of four stars, praising Hutton's [[Typecasting (acting)#Playing against type|against type]] performance as Stark that \"definitively shed his nice-guy image\". However, Ebert faulted ''The Dark Half'' for failing to \"develop its preternatural opening theme\" and never offering a satisfactory explanation for Stark's existence.<ref>[https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/the-dark-half-1993 Ebert, Roger, \"The Dark Half,\" rogerebert.com, 23 April 1993]</ref>\n\n==Awards==\n*[[Academy of Science Fiction, Fantasy & Horror Films]]\n**Saturn Award Best Director - [[George A.
