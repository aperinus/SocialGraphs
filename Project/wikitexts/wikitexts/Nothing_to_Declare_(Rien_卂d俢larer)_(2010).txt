The first French volunteer for the squad is Mathias Ducatel, Vandervoorde's personal [[wiktionary:b\u00eate noire|''b\u00eate noire'']]. He does this because he has fallen in love with Vandervoorde's sister Louise, and is afraid to unveil their love because of the trouble it will cause within her family.\n\nMeanwhile, in an effort to raise money for the restaurant ''No Man's Land'' during the transition to the [[Schengen Agreement]], Jacques and Irene are hired by a drug trafficker named Duval to pass along information concerning the mobile squad's checkpoints. Unfortunately, the information is rendered useless as Duval's accomplice Tiburce hilariously fails to avoid customs and ends up in jail.\n\nIn their pursuit of the drug trafficker, Vandevoorde and Ducatel become close, at first because the priest tells Vandevoorde that his hatred towards the French will lead him straight to hell. But soon, Vandevoorde really starts to think of Ducatel as a good friend until he finds out that Ducatel has been seeing his sister in secret for a year. At that point, he pulls out his gun and tries to shoot Ducatel but his sister stops him, because she loves him.\n\nIn the end, Vandevoorde accepts them as a couple but remains a xenophobe and the audience is left in the dark about whether the father, who is much more of a Francophobe, accepts them or not.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Beno\u00eet Poelvoorde]]: Ruben Vandevoorde\n* [[Dany Boon]]: Mathias Ducatel\n* [[Karin Viard]]: Ir\u00e8ne Janus\n* [[Fran\u00e7ois Damiens]]: Jacques Janus\n* Julie Bernard: Louise Vandevoorde\n* [[Eric Godon]]: Chief Willems\n* [[Zinedine Soualem]]: Lucas Pozzi\n* [[Bruno Lochet]]: Tiburce\n* [[Nad\u00e8ge Beausson-Diagne]]: Nadia Bakari\n* Philippe Magnan: Mercier\n* Guy Lecluyse: Gr\u00e9gory Brioul\n* [[Laurent Gamelon]]: Duval\n* David Coudyser: the country driver\n* [[J\u00e9r\u00f4me Commandeur]]: the French driver\n* [[Bouli Lanners]]: Bruno Vanuxem\n* [[Jean-Luc Couchard]]: Brother Vanuxem\n* [[Olivier Gourmet]]: the priest from Chimay\n* [[Bruno Moynot]]: the estate agent\n* Jean-Paul Dermont: Father Vandevoorde\n* [[Laurent Capelluto]]: the Russian\n* Chritel Pedrinelli: Olivia Vandevoorde\n* Joachim Ledeganck: L\u00e9opold Vandevoorde\n* [[Sylviane Alliet]]: \"No Man's Land\" client\n\n==Production==\nIn an interview with ClapVideo, Dany Boon says that he wrote this film because he wanted to create something as strong as [[Welcome to the Sticks]] (French title: Bienvenue chez les Ch'tis). He was inspired by the fact that \"we're all a stranger to someone\", and that \"we all experience some futile rejection that lead us to do stupid things\". He also took inspiration of his parents' relationship and transformed it into the love story between Mathias Ducatel and Louise Vandevoorde.{{citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\n==Reception==\n===Box office===\nAccording to [[Path\u00e9]] the film sold {{formatnum:48155}} tickets in the [[Nord-Pas-de-Calais]] on the opening night, the biggest film success in the region since ''[[Bienvenue chez les Ch'tis]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.lavoixdunord.fr/Dany-Boon/Rien-a-declarer/sorties/2011/01/27/article_rien-a-declarer-premier-jour-un-succes.shtml|title=Article \" Rien \u00e0 d\u00e9clarer \", premier jour : un succ\u00e8s sans exc\u00e8s''|accessdate=October 13, 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Critical response===\nOne of the major themes of the movie is how the European Union's vision of Europe may be good in theory but in practice can be damaging to the local economy in the border regions.\n\nCritical reception of this film has been generally mixed.
