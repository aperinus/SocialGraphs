It is an adaptation of the novel ''Doll's Eyes'' (1993) by [[Bari Wood]]. The film stars [[Annette Bening]], [[Robert Downey Jr.]], [[Aidan Quinn]], and [[Stephen Rea]]. It\u2019s screenplay was co-written by Jordan and screenwriter [[Bruce Robinson]]. Filming took place various locations throughout New England as well as on the [[Baja California Peninsula]].\n\n''In Dreams'' was released in the United States on January 15, 1999, by [[DreamWorks Pictures]]. The film grossed $12 million at the box office, and received varied reviews from critics, with several praising its visuals and Bening's performance, while others criticizing its lack of narrative coherence.\n\n==Plot==\nClaire Cooper is a suburban housewife and mother in rural [[Massachusetts]] who illustrates children's stories. Her husband, Paul, is an airline pilot, and is frequently away from home due to work, leaving Claire to care for their daughter, Rebecca. Claire begins experiencing bizarre, vague [[dream]]s involving an underwater city and the murder of a young girl. Shortly after, Rebecca goes missing during an outdoor school play, and is later found dead at the bottom of a lake. Claire is devastated and takes a while to recover.\n\nBelieving her dreams are [[wikt:premonition|premonitory]], Claire attempts to involve herself in the police investigation, but is met with resistance. Her dreams and visions increase, and she believes she is witnessing the movements of her daughter's killer, a [[serial killer]] named Vivian Thompson. She uncovers that the underwater city she has experienced in her dreams is a former town, Northfield, that was flooded when a [[reservoir]] was formed.\n\nThe visions drive Claire to the brink of insanity, and she seeks help from a psychologist, Dr. Silverman, who diagnoses her as [[psychosis|psychotic]]. She is subsequently committed to a [[psychiatric institution]] after slitting her wrists, but remains plagued by visions, including one of Vivian  murdering Paul. When she experiences another vision of Vivian kidnapping another girl, Claire manages to escape from the institution, hoping to stop him from claiming another victim. She steals the vehicle of a security guard, and tracks Vivian to an abandoned fruit factory situated along the lake.\n\nUpon arriving at the factory, she is met by Vivian and the young girl, Ruby. The childlike Vivian, who was severely [[child abuse|abused]] as a boy by his mother, kidnaps little girls to be his \"playmates\"; when they resist, he becomes enraged and kills them. He is holding Claire hostage at the factory, and wants her and Ruby to stay with him as his \"new family\". Police manage to track Claire to the factory, where they have a face-off with Vivian, holding a gun to Claire's head. While a [[SWAT]] team attempts to snipe Vivian from a helicopter, he chases Claire along a bridge crossing a tributary waterfall, knocking both her and himself over the guardrail. Claire and Vivian plunge below the falls. In the water, Claire has a vision of being reunited with her daughter before drowning.\n\nLater, Vivian, who survived the fall, is committed to the same psychiatric institute where Claire had been incarcerated. While lying in his bed, he has horrific visions of Claire's spirit haunting him and the phrase \"Sweet dreams, Vivian\" being scrawled in blood on the ceiling. The phrase emerges across the walls of his cell, and he screams in horror.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Annette Bening]] as Claire Cooper\n* [[Katie Sagona]] as Rebecca Cooper\n* [[Aidan Quinn]] as Paul Cooper\n* [[Robert Downey Jr.]] as Vivian Thompson\n* [[Paul Guilfoyle]] as Detective Jack Kay\n* Kathleen Langlois as Snow White\n* Jennifer Holly Berry as Hunter\n* Amelia Claire Novotny as Prince\n* Kristin Sroka as Wicked Step-Mother\n* Robert Walsh as Man at School Play\n* Denise Cormier as Woman at School Play\n* John Fiore as Policeman\n* [[Ken Cheeseman]] as Paramedic\n* [[Dennis Boutsikaris]] as Doctor Stevens\n* [[Stephen Rea]] as Doctor Silverman\n* [[Margo Martindale]] as Nurse Floyd\n* June Lewin as Kindly Nurse\n* [[Pamela Payton-Wright]] as Ethel\n* [[Geoffrey Wigdor]] as Vivian Thompson - As Teenager\n* Krystal Benn as Ruby\n* Dorothy Dwyer as Foster Mother\n{{Div col end}}\n\n==Analysis==\nFilm scholar Maria Pramaggiore notes ''In Dreams'' as one example in Jordan's filmography in which popular songs are employed to \"disestablish time and place to convey the notion of time as a cyclical process.\"{{sfn|Pramaggiore|2008|p=96}} Pramaggiore also stresses the importance of the [[uncanny]] in the film, citing it as one of several in Jordan's filmography{{em dash}}along with ''[[The Miracle (1991 film)|The Miracle]]'' (1991) and ''[[The Butcher Boy (1997 film)|The Butcher Boy]]'' (1997){{em dash}}in which \"dreams assume the status of reality.\"{{sfn|Pramaggiore|2008|p=22}}\n\n==Production==\n===Screenplay===\nThe film is based on the novel ''Doll's Eyes'', by [[Bari Wood]].<ref name=mathews/> The project originated as a script titled ''Blue Vision,'' written by [[Bruce Robinson]].
