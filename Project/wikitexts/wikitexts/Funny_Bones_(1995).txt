After his own Las Vegas comedy act flops with his beloved father in the audience, Tommy returns to [[Blackpool]], where he spent the summers of his childhood.\n\nDisguised with a new identity, Tommy intends to seek out unique performers and purchase their acts. During this time, Tommy encounters his father's old comedy partners, Bruno and Thomas Parker. Once great performers, they now work as ghouls on a ghost train at Blackpool Pleasure Beach Circus.\n\nBruno's son Jack is a brilliant comic,  but psychologically troubled. He has also been manipulated by a corrupt policeman known as Sharkey into stealing valuable wax eggs from smugglers. Tommy meets Jack's mother Katie, and even though Tommy is in disguise, she suspects that he is somehow connected to the family.\n\nTommy eventually realises that his father stole his original act from the Parker brothers. He then reveals himself to be Tommy Fawkes and Katie tells him that Jack is his half-brother. Tommy phones his father about the revelation and George gets on the next plane to Blackpool.\n\nAs part of their reconciliation, George arranges for the Parkers to top the bill at a [[Blackpool Tower Circus]] event. However, Jack is still hounded by Sharkey and cannot perform. During an elaborate Egyptian act, Katie gets rid of Sharkey via a [[sarcophagus]], which is then kidnapped by the smugglers. The wax eggs (Chinese inscription on egg is read \"Eight Immortals\") contained a mystical, ancient Chinese rejuvenating powder. Jack had previously placed the powder within a makeup tin, which Bruno and Thomas accidentally use, helping them to perform brilliantly.\n\nToward the end of the show, Jack is seen being chased by a policeman and climbing a giant flexible pole to escape. The pole rocks side to side and Jack spins around  on the flexing pole, and smacks the climbing policeman in the face. The policeman begins to fall and is revealed to be Tommy.\n\nIn the last moments, Jack clasps Tommy's hand and saves him, both now wildly swinging around at the end of pole.  The circus audience claps wildly with relief.  Jack yells to Tommy, \"I think they're beginning to like you.\" Jack laughs and Tommy, suddenly no longer afraid, waves at the audience spinning past and laughs joyfully.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Oliver Platt]] as Tommy Fawkes\n* [[Jerry Lewis]] as George Fawkes\n* [[Lee Evans (comedian)|Lee Evans]] as Jack Parker\n* [[Leslie Caron]] as Katie Parker\n* [[Richard Griffiths]] as Jim Minty\n* [[Sadie Corre]] as Poodle Woman\n* [[Oliver Reed]] as Dolly Hopkins\n* [[George Carl]] as Thomas Parker\n* [[Freddie Davies]] as Bruno Parker\n* [[Ian McNeice]] as Stanley Sharkey\n* [[Christopher Greet]] as Lawrence Berger\n* [[Ruta Lee]] as Laura Fawkes\n* [[Harold Nicholas]] as Himself\n* [[Peter Gunn (actor)|Peter Gunn]] as Nicky\n\n==Home media==\n''Funny Bones'' was released on DVD on 2 September 2003.{{citation needed|date=December 2019}}\n\n==Reception==\nOn [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film has an approval rating of 63%, based on 19 reviews, with an average rating of 6.4/10.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/funny_bones|title = Funny Bones|website = [[Rotten Tomatoes]]}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|0113133|Funny Bones}}\n* {{Allmovie title|133595|Funny Bones}}\n* {{mojo title|funnybones|Funny Bones}}\n* {{rotten-tomatoes|funny_bones|Funny Bones}}\n\n{{Peter Chelsom}}\n\n[[Category:1995 films]]\n[[Category:1995 comedy-drama films]]\n[[Category:American comedy-drama films]]\n[[Category:British comedy-drama films]]\n[[Category:Films set in Blackpool]]\n[[Category:Hollywood Pictures films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Peter Chelsom]]\n[[Category:1990s English-language films]]\n[[Category:1990s American films]]\n[[Category:1990s British films]]"}]}}}}
