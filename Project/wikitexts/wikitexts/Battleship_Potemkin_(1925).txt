Eisenstein divided the plot into five acts, each with its own title:\n\n===Act I: Men and Maggots===\nThe scene begins with two sailors, Matyushenko and Vakulinchuk, discussing the need for the crew of the ''Potemkin'', anchored off the island of [[Tendra Spit|Tendra]], to support the [[1905 Russian Revolution|revolution]] then taking place within Russia. After their watch, they and other off-duty sailors are sleeping in their hammocks. As an officer inspects the quarters, he stumbles and takes out his aggression on a sleeping sailor. The ruckus causes Vakulinchuk to awake, and he gives a speech to the men as they come to. Vakulinchuk says, \"Comrades! The time has come when we too must speak out. Why wait? All of Russia has risen! Are we to be the last?\" The scene cuts to morning above deck, where sailors are remarking on the poor quality of the meat for the crew. The meat appears to be rotten and covered in worms, and the sailors say that \"even a dog wouldn't eat this!\" The ship's doctor, Smirnov, is called over to inspect the meat by the captain. Rather than worms, the doctor says that the insects are maggots, and they can be washed off before cooking. The sailors further complain about the poor quality of the rations, but the doctor declares the meat edible and ends the discussion. Senior officer Giliarovsky forces the sailors still looking over the rotten meat to leave the area, and the cook begins to prepare [[borscht]] although he too questions the quality of the meat. The crew refuses to eat the borscht, instead choosing bread and water, and canned goods. While cleaning dishes, one of the sailors sees an inscription on a plate which reads \"[[Lord's prayer|give us this day our daily bread]]\". After considering the meaning of this phrase, the sailor smashes the plate and the scene ends.\n\n===Act II: Drama on the Deck===\nAll those who refuse the meat are judged guilty of insubordination and are brought to the fore-deck where they receive religious last rites. The sailors are obliged to kneel and a canvas cover is thrown over them as a firing squad marches onto the deck. The First Officer gives the order to fire, but in response to Vakulinchuk's pleas the sailors in the firing squad lower their rifles and the uprising begins. The sailors overwhelm the outnumbered officers and take control of the ship. The officers are thrown overboard, the ship's priest is dragged out of hiding, and finally the doctor is thrown into the ocean as 'food for the worms'. The mutiny is successful but Vakulinchuk, the charismatic leader of the rebels, is killed.\n\n===Act III: A Dead Man Calls Out===\nThe ''Potemkin'' arrives at the port of [[Odessa]]. Vakulinchuk's body is taken ashore and displayed publicly by his companions in a tent with a sign on his chest that says \"For a spoonful of borscht\" (\u0418\u0437\u044a-\u0437\u0430 \u043b\u043e\u0436\u043a\u0438 \u0431\u043e\u0440\u0449\u0430). The citizens of Odessa, saddened yet empowered by Vakulinchuk's sacrifice, are soon whipped into a frenzy against the Tsar and his government by sympathizers. A man allied with the government tries to turn the citizens' fury against the Jews, but he is quickly shouted down and beaten by the people. The sailors gather to make a final farewell and praise Vakulinchuk as a hero. The people of Odessa welcome the sailors, but they attract the police as they mobilize against the government.\n\n===Act IV: The Odessa Steps===\nThe citizenry of Odessa take to their ships and boats, sailing out to the ''Potemkin'' to show their support to the sailors and donate supplies, while a crowd of others gather at the [[Potemkin Stairs|Odessa steps]] to witness the happenings and cheer on the rebels. Suddenly a detachment of dismounted [[Cossack host|Cossacks]] form battle lines at the top of the steps and march toward a crowd of unarmed civilians including women and children, and begin firing and advancing with fixed bayonets. Every now and again, the soldiers halt to fire a volley into the crowd before continuing their impersonal, machine-like assault down the stairs, ignoring the people's pleas for humanity and understanding. Meanwhile, government cavalry attack the fleeing crowd at the bottom of the steps as well, cutting down many of those who survived the dismounted assault. Brief sequences show individuals among the people fleeing or falling, a baby carriage rolling down the steps, a woman shot in the face, broken glasses, and the high boots of the soldiers moving in unison.\n\nIn retaliation, the sailors of the ''Potemkin'' use the guns of the battleship to fire on the city opera house, where Tsarist military leaders are convening a meeting. Meanwhile, there is news that a squadron of loyal warships is coming to quell the revolt of the ''Potemkin''.\n\n===Act V: One Against All===\nThe sailors of the ''Potemkin'' decide to take the battleship out from the port of Odessa to face the fleet of the Tsar. Just when battle seems inevitable, the sailors of the Tsarist squadron refuse to open fire, cheering and shouting to show solidarity with the mutineers and allowing the ''Potemkin'', flying the [[Red flag (politics)|red flag]], to pass between their ships.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Aleksandr Antonov (actor)|Aleksandr Antonov]] as [[Grigory Vakulinchuk]] (Bolshevik sailor)\n* Vladimir Barsky as Commander Golikov\n* [[Grigori Aleksandrov]] as Chief Officer Giliarovsky\n* I.

Eisenstein began filming in Leningrad and had time to shoot the railway strike episode, [[horsecar]], city at night and the strike crackdown on Sadovaya Street. Further shooting was prevented by deteriorating weather, with fog setting in. At the same time, the director faced tight time constraints: the film needed to be finished by the end of the year, although the script was approved only on 4 June. Eisenstein decided to give up the original script consisting of eight episodes, to focus on just one, the uprising on the [[Russian battleship Potemkin|battleship ''Potemkin'']], which involved just a few pages (41 frames) from Agadzhanova's script. Eisenstein and [[Grigori Aleksandrov]] essentially recycled and extended the script.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://gornovosti.ru/tema/other/3529-shedevr-za-dva-mesyaca.htm |publisher=Gorodskie Novosti |title=\u0428\u0435\u0434\u0435\u0432\u0440 \u0437\u0430 \u0434\u0432\u0430 \u043c\u0435\u0441\u044f\u0446\u0430 |access-date=5 February 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140808104224/http://gornovosti.ru/tema/other/3529-shedevr-za-dva-mesyaca.htm |archive-date=8 August 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref> In addition, during the progress of making the film, some episodes were added that had existed neither in Agadzhanova's script nor in Eisenstein's scenic sketches, such as the storm scene with which the film begins.

Poet [[Vladimir Mayakovsky]] intervened because his good friend, poet [[Nikolai Aseev]], had participated in the making of the film's intertitles. Mayakovsky's opposing party was Sovkino's president [[Konstantin Shvedchikov]]. He was a politician and friend of Vladimir Lenin who once hid Lenin in his home before the Revolution. Mayakovsky presented Shvedchikov with a hard demand that the film would be distributed abroad, and intimidated Shvedchikov with the fate of becoming a villain in history books. Mayakovsky's closing sentence was \"Shvedchikovs come and go, but art remains. Remember that!\" Besides Mayakovsky many others also persuaded Shvedchikov to spread the film around the world and after constant pressure from Sovkino he eventually sent the film to Berlin. There ''Battleship Potemkin'' became a huge success, and the film was again screened in Moscow.<ref name=\"leyda\" />\n\nWhen [[Douglas Fairbanks]] and [[Mary Pickford]] visited Moscow in July 1926, they were full of praise for ''Battleship Potemkin''; Fairbanks helped distribute the film in the U.S., and even asked Eisenstein to go to Hollywood. In the U.S. the film premiered in New York on 5 December 1926, at the [[Samuel J.

In 2004, a three-year restoration of the film was completed. Many excised scenes of violence were restored, as well as the original written introduction by Trotsky. The previous titles, which had toned down the mutinous sailors' revolutionary rhetoric, were corrected so that they would now be an accurate translation of the original Russian titles.\n\n==Soundtracks==\n{{More citations needed section|date=June 2020}}\nIn order to retain its relevance as a propaganda film for each new generation, Eisenstein hoped the score would be rewritten every 20 years. The original score was composed by [[Edmund Meisel]]. A salon orchestra performed the Berlin premiere in 1926. The instruments were flute/piccolo, trumpet, trombone, harmonium, percussion and strings without viola. Meisel wrote the score in twelve days because of the late approval of film censors. As time was so short Meisel repeated sections of the score. Composer/conductor Mark-Andreas Schlingensiepen has reorchestrated the original piano score to fit the version of the film available today.\n\n[[Nikolai Kryukov (composer)|Nikolai Kryukov]] composed a new score in 1950 for the 25th anniversary. In 1985, Chris Jarrett composed a solo piano accompaniment for the movie. In 1986 [[Eric Allaman]] wrote an electronic score for a showing that took place at the 1986 [[Berlin International Film Festival]]. The music was commissioned by the organizers, who wanted to commemorate the 60th anniversary of the film's German premiere. The score was played only at this premiere and has not been released on CD or DVD. Contemporary reviews were largely positive apart from negative comment because the music was electronic. Allaman also wrote an opera about Battleship Potemkin, which is musically separate from the film score.\n\nIn commercial format, on DVD for example, the film is usually accompanied by classical music added for the \"50th anniversary edition\" released in 1975. Three symphonies from [[Dmitri Shostakovich]] have been used, with [[Symphony No. 5 (Shostakovich)|No. 5]], beginning and ending the film, being the most prominent. A version of the film offered by the [[Internet Archive]] has a soundtrack that also makes heavy use of the symphonies of Shostakovich, including his [[Symphony No. 4 (Shostakovich)|Fourth]], [[Symphony No. 5 (Shostakovich)|Fifth]], [[Symphony No. 8 (Shostakovich)|Eighth]], [[Symphony No. 10 (Shostakovich)|Tenth]], and [[Symphony No. 11 (Shostakovich)|Eleventh]].\n\nIn 2007, Del Rey & The Sun Kings also recorded this soundtrack. In an attempt to make the film relevant to the 21st century, [[Neil Tennant]] and [[Chris Lowe]] (of the [[Pet Shop Boys]]) composed a soundtrack in 2004 with the Dresden Symphonic Orchestra. Their soundtrack, released in 2005 as ''[[Battleship Potemkin (album)|Battleship Potemkin]]'', premiered in September 2004 at an open-air concert in [[Trafalgar Square]], London. There were four further live performances of the work with the Dresdner Sinfoniker in Germany in September 2005, and one at the [[Swan Hunter]] shipyard in [[Newcastle upon Tyne]] in 2006.\n\nThe avant-garde jazz ensemble [[Club Foot Orchestra]] has also re-scored the film, and performed live accompanying the film with a score by Richard Marriott, conducted by Deirdre McClure. For the 2005 restoration of the film, under the direction of [[Enno Patalas]] in collaboration with Anna Bohn, released on DVD and Blu-ray, the [[Deutsche Kinemathek]] - Museum fur Film und Fernsehen, commissioned a re-recording of the original Edmund Meisel score, performed by the Babelsberg Orchestra, conducted by Helmut Imig. In 2011 the most recent restoration was completed with an entirely new soundtrack by members of the Apskaft group. Contributing members were AER20-200, awaycaboose, Ditzky, Drn Drn, Foucault V, fydhws, Hox Vox, Lurholm, mexicanvader, Quendus, Res Band, -Soundso- and speculativism. The entire film was digitally restored to a sharper image by Gianluca Missero (who records under the name Hox Vox).

The Berklee Silent Film Orchestra also composed a new score for the film in 2011, and performed it live to picture at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, in Washington, D.C.
