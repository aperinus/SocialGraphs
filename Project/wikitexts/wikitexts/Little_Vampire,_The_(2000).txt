It was directed by [[Uli Edel]] and written by [[Karey Kirkpatrick]] and [[Larry Wilson (screenwriter)|Larry Wilson]]. The film stars [[Jonathan Lipnicki]], [[Rollo Weeks]], [[Richard E. Grant]], [[Jim Carter (actor)|Jim Carter]] and [[Alice Krige]].\n\n==Plot==\n9-year-old Tony Thompson ([[Jonathan Lipnicki]]) moves with his family from [[California]] to [[Scotland]], where they take up residence in a small castle while his father is employed building a golf course on the estate of Lord McAshton ([[John Wood (English actor)|John Wood]]). In his new home Tony starts experiencing nightmares about vampires and a mysterious comet. Things are not any better for him at school, as he gets picked on by Lord McAshton's grandsons, Flint (Scott Fletcher) and Nigel ([[Iain De Caestecker]]).\n\nOne night, while dressed up as a vampire, Tony is mistaken for one by the young vampire Rudolph ([[Rollo Weeks]]), who is on the run from the evil vampire hunter Rookery ([[Jim Carter (actor)|Jim Carter]]). After realizing that Tony is not a vampire, Rudolph tries to attack him but ultimately fails due to being weakened by Rookery. After trying to leave through flying out the window, Rudolph falls from the sky due to his weakness. Tony helps Rudolph find a cow to feed from, and in return Rudolph takes Tony flying. The two boys quickly become friends, and Rudolph confides to Tony that his family only drink animal blood and wish to become human. Rudolph reveals that they are searching for a magical amulet that can be used to turn vampires into humans, but Rookery is also seeking to use the amulet against them. When Rudolph takes Tony to the cemetery where his family lives, they are confronted by Rudolph's parents Frederick ([[Richard E. Grant]]) and Freda ([[Alice Krige]]), Rudolph's romantic sister Anna ([[Anna Popplewell]]) and rebellious teen brother Gregory ([[Dean Cook]]). Frederick doubts Tony's loyalty to his son, but when Tony helps repel an attack from Rookery, Frederick begrudgingly allows Tony to help them, but warns him not to betray him and the rest of the vampire clan to Rookery. Tony and Rudolph then proceed to get revenge on Flint and Nigel.\n\nRookery alerts Lord McAshton to the presence of vampires in the village. Lord McAshton reveals that his family has known about the existence of vampires for generations. Elizabeth, an ancestor of Lord McAshton, was romantically involved with Rudolph's uncle Von, who was the last known holder of the amulet, and both lovers were killed by the McAshtons. Learning this, Tony, Rudolph, and Anna seek out Elizabeth's tomb, where Tony experiences a vision pointing out the location of the amulet: Tony's own bedroom. Rudolph and Tony race Rookery to the amulet while the rest of Rudolph's family, along with Tony's parents, travel to the site of the ritual the vampires hope to perform. After a chase, Tony and Rudolph manage to escape with the amulet while Rookery inadvertently drives his truck over a cliff after getting entangled in a blimp.\n\nTony and Rudolph succeed in bringing Frederick the amulet, but the ceremony is interrupted by Rookery, who returns riding the blimp. The vampires are unable to stand against Rookery's glowing cross, but Tony's parents defend them and defeat Rookery, pushing him off a cliff to his apparent death. Tony completes the ceremony by wishing for the vampires to become human. Rudolph and his family disappear as the comet passes, leaving Tony and his parents alone and unsure if the ceremony succeeded. Some time later, while visiting the village market, Tony spots Rudolph and his family, now human, moving into a house in the village. At first they seem not to recognize Tony, but as Tony does the whistle to them their memories return, and the friends are reunited.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Jonathan Lipnicki]] as Tony Thompson, an 9-year-old boy who becomes friends with Rudolph.\n* [[Rollo Weeks]] as Rudolph Sackville-Bagg, the middle child of the Sackville-Bagg family.\n* [[Jim Carter (actor)|Jim Carter]] as Rookery, a ruthless vampire hunter and the main [[villain]] of the film.\n* [[Richard E.
