It is played by bands of roving teams known as juggs, who challenge local teams.  They might be considered professional athletes, as they make their living through the tribute paid by the town people, should they defeat the local team. Their trophy is the dog skull from the town. The Game involves two armoured teams of five attempting to score by placing a dog skull on the opposing team's goalpost. One unarmed player\u2014the \"quick\"\u2014runs with the skull while being protected by his/her teammates from attack by the opposing team.\n\nHowever, not all in this time live so sparsely.  The Nine Cities, buried deep underground, are home to affluent and powerful members of the aristocracy.  Each of The Nine Cities fields its own team of juggs in an organization known as The League, and its membership is maintained with a fresh stream of new players who are proven veterans of the travelling \"dog-town\" games by their collection of trophy skulls.\n\nMembers of The League live in luxury almost equal to that of aristocrats.  It is a dream among roving juggs to be good enough to get The League's attention and, with it, all of the luxuries afforded a League player.\n\nThe team consists of Sallow ([[Rutger Hauer]]), Dog-Boy ([[Justin Monjo]]), Mbulu ([[Delroy Lindo]]), Big Cimber ([[Anna Katarina]]), and Young Gar ([[Vincent D'Onofrio]]).\n\nSallow, the team leader, has played in the League of the Nine Cities before, but was cast out because of his indiscretions with an Overlord's daughter. Kidda ([[Joan Chen]]), an ambitious peasant girl, joins the team after a game in her dog town where she virtually destroyed her competition. She and Gar inspire Sallow to challenge The League and expunge his past.\n\nBut Kidda and Gar do not realise that the City games are for much more than honour and victory, they will need to fight for their very survival.  The Game is played much harder and meaner in the Nine Cities.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Rutger Hauer]] as Sallow                           \n* [[Joan Chen]] as Kidda\n* [[Vincent D'Onofrio]] as Gar\n* [[Delroy Lindo]] as Mbulu\n* [[Anna Katarina]] as Big Cimber\n* Justin Monjo as Dog-Boy\n* [[Hugh Keays-Byrne]] as Lord  Vile\n* Max Fairchild as Gonzo\n* Gandhi MacIntyre as Gandhi\n* [[Richard Norton (actor)|Richard Norton]] as Bone\n* Lia Francisa as Mara\n* [[Steve Rackman]] as Samchin Jugger\n\n==Production==\n{{expand section|date=July 2022}}\n''The Salute of the Jugger'' was shot in the desert of [[Coober Pedy]], [[Australia]].\n\n==Alternate cuts==\nThe US theatrical version of the film was significantly shorter than the original version released overseas. About ten minutes were cut. The biggest difference is in the ending. In the American release, the credits roll shortly after the climax, even though picture continues to roll, showing certain conversations with music covering the dialogue. In the longer cut, there are denouement scenes.\n\nThe US DVD release of the film matches the US theatrical cut in being much shorter than the original film. Full versions were released on VHS in the early 1990s in Australia, the United Kingdom, Europe and Japan. Various distributors began releasing the original cut on DVD in early 2001, known as the extended version or by the title \"Salute to the Jugger\".\n\nIn 2017, a 2-disc Blu-ray set with both cuts of the film was released in Japan.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Quintet (film)|''Quintet'' (film)]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|id=0094764|title=The Blood of Heroes}}\n*[http://www.ozmovies.com.au/movie/salute-of-the-jugger ''Salute of the Jugger''] at Oz Movies\n* {{Rotten Tomatoes|blood_of_heroes}}\n* {{Mojo title|bloodofheroes|The Blood of Heroes}}\n\n{{David Peoples}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Salute of the Jugger, The}}\n[[Category:1989 films]]\n[[Category:1989 directorial debut films]]\n[[Category:1989 science fiction films]]\n[[Category:1980s English-language films]]\n[[Category:1980s science fiction action films]]\n[[Category:1980s sports films]]\n[[Category:American post-apocalyptic films]]\n[[Category:American science fiction action films]]\n[[Category:American sports drama films]]\n[[Category:Australian post-apocalyptic films]]\n[[Category:Australian science fiction action films]]\n[[Category:Australian sports drama films]]\n[[Category:Films about competitions]]\n[[Category:Films about death games]]\n[[Category:Films produced by Charles Roven]]\n[[Category:Films shot in South Australia]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by David Peoples]]\n[[Category:1980s American films]]"}]}}}}
