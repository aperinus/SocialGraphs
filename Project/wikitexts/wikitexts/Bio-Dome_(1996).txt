It was produced by [[Motion Picture Corporation of America]] on a budget of $8.5 million and was distributed theatrically by [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]].\n\nThe plot of the film revolves around two clumsy, dim-witted [[slacker]]s who, while on a road trip, look for a toilet in what they believe is a [[shopping mall]]. The shopping mall turns out to be a \"bio-dome\", a form of [[closed ecological system]], in which five scientists are about to be hermetically sealed for a year. The film has themes of [[environmentalism]], combined with [[Substance abuse|drug use]], [[sexual innuendo]], and [[toilet humor]].\n\nThe film stars [[Stephen Baldwin]] and [[Pauly Shore]], and has [[cameo appearance]]s by celebrities such as [[Roger Clinton, Jr.|Roger Clinton]] and [[Patty Hearst|Patricia Hearst]]. [[Jack Black]] and [[Kyle Gass]] first came to global attention in ''Bio-Dome'', performing together as [[Tenacious D]] on-screen for the first time.<ref>{{cite news | url= http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/music/cd_reviews/article612938.ece | work=The Times | location=London | title= Dude where's my guitar | date=October 29, 2006 | access-date=April 26, 2010 | first=Jasper | last=Rees}} {{subscription required}}</ref>\n\nThe film grossed $13 million at the box office in North America. ''Bio-Dome'' was panned by critics, gaining a record low score of 1/100 on Metacritic. It is often considered to be the [[List of films considered the worst#Bio-Dome (1996)|one of the worst films ever made]].\n\nOn December 18, 2013, Stephen Baldwin appeared on [[Mancow Muller]]'s radio/TV show, confirming he was in talks with Pauly Shore about making a sequel to the film revolving around the children of Bud and Doyle, their characters.\n\n==Plot==\nBest friends Bud \"Squirrel\" Macintosh and Doyle \"Stubs\" Johnson live together in [[Arizona]], but their [[environmentalist]] girlfriends, Jen and Monique, dump them due to their immaturity. Driving back home, they pass by the Bio-Dome, where scientist Dr. Noah Faulkner is about to seal his team in for a year without outside contact. Mistaking the Bio-Dome for a mall, Bud and Doyle go inside to use the bathroom, only to be sealed in along with the scientists. Dr. Leaky, the project's investor, discovers them and demands their removal, but Dr. Faulkner refuses, claiming it would destroy the purpose of the experiment, so Bud and Doyle remain. Although things initially go smoothly, this proves to be a mistake, as Bud and Doyle continue their antics, harming themselves and destroying many of the scientists' projects. The scientists plead to Dr. Faulkner, but he only relents after the two find a secret stash of junk food and experiment with [[laughing gas]]. The two are then banished to the desert environment section, and after three days of isolation, they discover a key in the lock of one of the windows, which opens a back door, and they escape the Bio-Dome.\n\nAs Bud and Doyle are receiving a pizza delivery at the dome, they learn Jen and Monique are attending an environmental party with other men, so decide to outdo the party and hold one inside the Bio-Dome to win them back. The party backfires, as it throws the experiment into chaos and Jen and Monique disavow the boys. The scientists prepare to exit out of the desert through the door, but realizing their idiotic actions, Bud and Doyle intervene and demand they all stay and restore the dome to full health, arguing that the real world itself is currently not a pristine environment, with Doyle swallowing the key as a last resort. The group subdues the situation and begins to fix the dome together, while the boys and the scientists bond with each other as a team, and Bud and Doyle's efforts in restoring the dome soon draw a large group of fans and supporters, including Monique and Jen. Meanwhile, Dr. Faulkner, who had disappeared the night of the party, has gone insane and is starting plans to blow up the dome with homemade coconut bombs.\n\nAfter several months pass and Earth Day approaches, Bud, Doyle, and the team successfully restore the dome, but on the night before the doors reopen, Bud and Doyle discover Dr. Faulkner, hoping to apologize to him and make amends. He tells the two that he is rigging pyrotechnics for the door-opening ceremony and gets them to help plant the items, unaware they are really bombs. Once Bud and Doyle are left alone with the bombs, they goof off with one of the coconuts, and after a failed long pass, they discover their dangerous nature. They alert the others and try to exit the dome early, but the door cannot be opened until the clock hits zero, when the bombs will detonate. Bud and Doyle run back into the dome to find Dr. Faulkner and get him to deactivate the bombs. After a chase and struggle, they knock him out and use a remote to disable the coconuts.\n\nWith the Bio-Dome experiment complete, the team gets ready to exit the now-open door, but as they begin to walk out, Dr. Faulkner returns with one last coconut bomb, trips, and the bomb detonates at the entrance.  Bud, Doyle, Jen, and Monique bid farewell to the Bio-Dome scientists and drive off, where Doyle yet again has to use the bathroom and the car is seen driving toward a mysterious [[nuclear power plant]]. Dr. Faulkner, meanwhile, has escaped the dome through the desert window door, having retrieved the key Doyle swallowed, and flees through the desert pursued by police.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Pauly Shore]] as Bud \"Squirrel\" Macintosh\n** [[Adam Weisman]] as young Bud\n* [[Stephen Baldwin]] as Doyle \"Stubs\" Johnson\n** Robbie Thibault, Jr. as young Doyle\n* [[William Atherton]] as Dr. Noah Faulkner\n* [[Joey Lauren Adams|Joey Adams]] as Monique\n* [[Teresa Hill]] as Jen\n* [[Rose McGowan]] as Denise\n* [[Denise Dowse]] as Dr. Olivia Biggs\n* Kevin West as T.C.
