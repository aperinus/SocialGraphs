Annwn was once populated by eight tribes, known as [[Tuatha D\u00e9 Danann|Garms]].<ref>{{Cite web|title = Review- Garm Wars: The Last Druid|url = https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/garm-wars-the-last-druid/.93884|website= animenewsnetwork.com|accessdate =March 31, 2018}}</ref> Long ago, the planet was at peace, as all the different races of Annwn were united by their collective servitude to their [[Creator deity|creator]], a [[Goddess]] name [[Danu (Irish goddess)|Danaan]]. Unfortunately, violence broke out when Danaan left, setting all the tribes against each other in a [[Perpetual war|never ending war]] for supremacy. The war proved devastating to the planet's [[Environmental impact of war|atmosphere]], resulting in near annihilations of most of the tribes on the planet, though three remained- the Briga, the Kumtak and the Columba. During this time, the [[Druids]], who previously conveyed the words of Annwn's Gods, disappeared. The Briga tribe lives on the ground and dominates in military superiority through the use of hybrid-powered [[tanks]] and [[cybernetics]] weaponry, while the weaker Kumtak tribe, facing near extinction, is forced to submit to the Briga by offering advance [[information technology]] in their war against the Columba. The Columba rule the sky through the use of [[mecha]]nized air forces and live in a fortified [[airship]]-like [[aircraft carrier|carrier]].\n\nThe film itself is divided into three different acts. In Act 1, ''The Exile of the Three Magi,'' a Kumtak man named Wydd ([[Lance Henriksen]]) is captured by the Columba, along with a dog resembling a [[basset hound]] who he refers to as a 'Gula' (a holy creature to all the tribes) and a mysterious being who is identified as Nascien (Summer Howell), the last of the missing Druids. During his interrogation aboard the Columba airship, Wydd claims that he fled from the Briga people because the Kumtak are enslaved, and offers his services and the Druid's power to fight against his people's oppressors. When the airship is eventually destroyed during a Briga attack, Wydd reveals his true purpose, which is to travel to the lands of the Druids with Nascien and find out why Danaan created the Garms, if she intended to leave. He then recruits Khara (Melanie St-Pierre), the Columba clone-soldier that interrogated him, and Skelling ([[Kevin Durand]]), the Briga officer who led the attack on the airship, before setting off on this quest.\n\nIn Act 2, ''Passage to the Other World,'' Wydd and his companions continue their journey to the land of the Druids. As the journey draws on, Skellig and Khara both learn that they are quickly running out of mana, the life-energy that sustains then. Despite this pressing concern, the party travels in a Briga tank across war-torn wastelands and seas. Upon witnessing the devastation and brutality of the war, Khara begins to question the worth of the war, but Skellig does not appear to share these concerns.\n\nIn the final act, ''Sacred Grove,'' the party finally arrives at the land of the Druids. Unfortunately, the Briga tank breaks down, forcing Skellig to stay behind and repair it as Wydd, Khara and Nascien continue onward. During their exploration of the sacred grove, Wydd accidentally activates the Druids' defence systems and awakens giant robotic defenders. Skellig manages to repair the tank and hold off the defenders while the others escape, but loses his life in the process. When the group finally arrives at the source of the Druid's knowledge and power, Nascien kills Wydd and reveals her true purpose: to take control of the Druid`s guardians and destroy all the Garms. While the guardians are awoken and set against the Garms, Khara manages to destroy Nascien before she escapes. Khara then asks the dying Nascien why the Garms were abandoned by the Gods. Nascien reveals that the Goddess Danaan left because she feared the destructive potential of the Garms, which is why Nascien took it upon herself to destroy them.  Nascien then says the God's true name to satisfy Khara's curiosity, claiming that \"They\" are a [[I am the Lord thy God|jealous God]]. Khara then shoots Nascien and falls into a state of sorrow.  As she looks up to the dispersed clouds, Gaia is revealed to resemble [[Earth]], indicating that Annwn was once the [[Moon]], and these \"[[Ancient astronauts|Gods]]\" and the Goddess Danaan were responsible for the creation of [[human|mankind]]. The film then ends on a [[cliffhanger]], with the rising gigantic robotic army called [[Angels in Judaism|Malakh]] and the Garm warring tribes finally abandoning their endless war to unite against the common enemy, thus beginning a new age of [[Armoured warfare|heavy warfare]] on the planet of Annwn.\n\n==Cast==\nCast is displayed in order of appearance:\n*[[Lance Henriksen]] as Wydd 256<ref name=hr/>\n*[[Kevin Durand]] as Skellig 58<ref name=tf>{{cite web|url= http://twitchfilm.com/2014/11/tokyo-2014-review-garm-wars-the-last-druid-mamoru-oshii-delivers-magic-dogs-amidst-turgid-fantasy.html|title= Tokyo 2014 Review: GARM WARS: THE LAST DRUID, Mamoru Oshii Delivers Magic Dogs Amidst Turgid Fantasy|author= Christopher O'Keeffe|date= November 7, 2014|accessdate= April 30, 2015|work= [[twitchfilm.com]]|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20150405125134/http://twitchfilm.com/2014/11/tokyo-2014-review-garm-wars-the-last-druid-mamoru-oshii-delivers-magic-dogs-amidst-turgid-fantasy.html|archive-date= April 5, 2015|url-status= dead}}</ref>\n*Melanie St-Pierre as Khara 22 and Khara 23<ref name=hr/>\n*Jordan Van Dyck as interrogator A<ref name=hr/>\n*Summer H.
