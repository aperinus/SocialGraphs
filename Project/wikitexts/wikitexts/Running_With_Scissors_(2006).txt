The semi-autobiographical account of Burroughs' childhood (when his real name was still Christopher Robison), based on his [[The New York Times Best Seller list|best-selling]] book, received mixed reviews as a film.\n\n==Plot==\nAugusten Burroughs' mother, Deirdre, who wishes to become a famous poet, suffers from severe mood swings and erratic behavior. Augusten's alcoholic father, Norman, proves to be of no help. By the time he is a teenager, Augusten no longer feels safe in his own house. Deirdre loudly claims that Norman is the reason for her unhappiness, and that he desires to kill her. She ultimately sends Augusten to live with her psychiatrist, Dr.&nbsp;Finch, the eccentric patriarch of an oddball family, which consists of his submissive wife Agnes, religious older daughter Hope, and his rebellious younger daughter Natalie, who is slightly older than Augusten.\n\nAugusten finds it hard to adjust to living with the Finches, and is subject to irregular weekend visits by his increasingly unsound mother. After confessing to Natalie that he is gay, Augusten befriends Neil Bookman, Finch's patient and adopted 33-year-old son. The two begin an erratic sexual relationship quickly after meeting, but Augusten, who turns 15 in the film, finds it difficult to cope with their age difference.\n\nConsistent with a [[Confidence trick|confidence pattern]] seen with the family of Neil &ndash; and with a 41-year-old patient who abused Natalie, and with young adult patient Dorothy Ambrose &ndash; Dr.&nbsp;Finch manipulates Deirdre into signing over her money to him. By the time of Augusten's 15th&nbsp;birthday, Deirdre has found temporary stability with her living companion Dorothy (\"I've always wanted a daughter\"), leaving Augusten feeling like his mother no longer wants him, while also dealing with the negative effects of Neil's [[schizophrenia]] and Dorothy's animosity.\n\nA few years later, the still-teenaged Augusten leaves for New York to become a writer. He says goodbye to his mother and goes to the bus station. Agnes, with whom he has developed a caring relationship, arrives and gives him some money she has saved up.\n\nIn a mid-credits vignette, it is shown that Dr. Finch lost his license for insurance fraud and died in 2000, Agnes went to work in a nursing home, Natalie earned a degree in psychology, Hope worked with her dad until his death, Norman re-established contact with Augusten before his death in 2005, Deirdre remains estranged from her son, Neil was never heard from again, and Augusten (the real Augusten, seen onscreen sitting beside the film's Augusten) wrote a book.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Joseph Michael Cross|Joseph Cross]] as [[Augusten Burroughs]]\n** Jack Kaeding as 6-year-old Augusten\n* [[Annette Bening]] as Deirdre Burroughs\n* [[Brian Cox (actor)|Brian Cox]] as Dr. Finch\n* [[Joseph Fiennes]] as Neil Bookman\n* [[Evan Rachel Wood]] as Natalie Finch\n* [[Alec Baldwin]] as Norman Burroughs\n* [[Jill Clayburgh]] as Agnes Finch\n* [[Gwyneth Paltrow]] as Hope Finch\n* [[Gabrielle Union]] as Dorothy Ambrose\n* [[Patrick Wilson (American actor)|Patrick Wilson]] as Michael Shephard\n* [[Kristin Chenoweth]] as Fern Stewart\n* [[Dagmara Dominczyk]] as Suzanne\n* [[Colleen Camp]] as Joan\n* [[Augusten Burroughs]] (''uncredited'') as Himself\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Critical response===\nThe [[review aggregator]] website [[Metacritic]] gave ''Running with Scissors'' a score of 52 out of 100, based on 32 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/running-with-scissors |title=Running with Scissors Reviews |publisher=[[Metacritic]] |access-date=December 25, 2013}}</ref> On [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film holds a 31% approval rating, based on 133 reviews, with an average score of 5/10.
