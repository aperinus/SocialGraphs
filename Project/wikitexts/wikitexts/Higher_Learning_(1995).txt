The film follows the changing lives of three incoming freshmen at the fictional Columbus University: Malik Williams ([[Omar Epps]]), a track star who struggles with academics; Kristen Connor ([[Kristy Swanson]]), a shy and naive girl; and Remy ([[Michael Rapaport]]), a lonely and confused man seemingly out of place in his new environment.<ref>{{cite news |title=Violence Erupts in Opening Week of 'Higher Learning' |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=January 20, 1995 |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1995-01-20/entertainment/ca-22364_1_higher-learning |access-date=June 3, 2012 |first=Richard |last=Natale |archive-date=August 12, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140812153735/http://articles.latimes.com/1995-01-20/entertainment/ca-22364_1_higher-learning |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nThe film also featured [[Tyra Banks]]' first performance in a theatrical film. [[Laurence Fishburne]] won an [[NAACP Image Award]] for \"Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Motion Picture\"; [[Ice Cube]] was also nominated for the award. This was the last film appearance of [[Dedrick D. Gobert]], who was shot dead in 1994 prior to the film's release.\n\nThe exterior shots and outdoor scenes were shot on the campus of [[University of California, Los Angeles]] (UCLA) while the interiors were shot at [[Sony Pictures Studios]].\n\n==Plot==<!--- Jan 2016: still a little long, at 831 words (vs 2131 words in Dec 2015), but then there are 3 converging storylines  ---> \n{{Long plot|date=April 2022}}\nThree incoming freshmen at fictional Columbus University are introduced: Kristen Connor, a friendly but naive white girl; Remy, a quiet young white man; and Malik Williams, a black high-school track-star attending college on an athletic scholarship.\n\nKristen's roommate Monet and Malik attend a [[Dormitory|dorm]] party hosted by Remy's militantly [[Afrocentrism|Afrocentric]] roommate Fudge White, a  senior. Upset at the loud [[Hip hop music|rap music]] being played so late as he attempts to study, Remy contacts campus police to break up the party. Fudge complains that the white police officers severely punish the black students yet ignore the room down the hall playing equally-loud \"[[hillbilly]]\" music. En route back to her dorm, Kristen meets Taryn, an openly-[[lesbian]] junior, who warns her about walking alone late at night and invites her to a student group.\n\nMalik and Kristen's introductory [[political science]] class is taught by Professor Maurice Phipps, a conservative black man from the [[West Indies]], who challenges the class to determine their own identity rather than letting others categorize them.\n\nFudge and his friend Dreads play loud music, which disrupts Remy's studying. When Remy complains, Fudge just threatens him. Remy moves out and gets a new roommate David, who is Jewish. Later, Remy loses at a video game to Malik who further mocks him.\n\nFrat boy Billy rapes a drunken Kristen. Monet finds Kristen crying on her bed then fields a call from Billy who uses a racial slur when she does not\u00a0let him speak to Kristen. Angered, Monet turns to Fudge who recruits his friends to confront Billy at a frat party. Kristen points out Billy to the black students who pull him outside and force him to apologize to Monet (unaware that he raped Kristen).\n\nKristen joins Taryn's student group on harmony between different races and cliques, eventually opening up to her about her rape. Taryn urges Kristen to report the rape while attempting to console her. As days pass, Kristen becomes increasingly attracted to Taryn.\n\nBecoming increasingly isolated, Remy is treated to a drink by [[White supremacy|white supremacist]] and [[neo-Nazi skinhead]] Scott Moss, eventually befriending Scott's skinhead friends Erik, James, and hulking weight-lifter Knocko.\n\nMalik confronts Phipps about a paper, arguing for a better grade. When Phipps explains the various spelling and grammar errors, Malik calls him a sellout for the \"white establishment\". Phipps angrily responds that the world owes Malik nothing and that Malik must work for himself to make a difference in the world. When Malik's teammates confront him over a poor performance at a track meet, he responds with Fudge's militant Afrocentric ideology. He walks away and flirts with fellow runner Deja, who becomes his girlfriend and shows him how to write a better essay.\n\nRemy increasingly spends time with Scott and his gang. Scott, preaching his racist beliefs, gradually convinces the troubled Remy that \"the white man is endangered\". After shaving his head, Remy is welcomed into Scott's group.\n\nAfter attending a rape awareness rally with Taryn, Kristen asks to spend the night. Taryn rebuffs her, wanting Kristen to be sure. Kristen eventually starts separate relationships with Wayne and Taryn who are unaware that Kristen is sleeping with both of them.\n\nAfter confronting Malik with racial slurs, Remy later pulls a handgun on Malik and David, hurling racial slurs at them both as he packs his belongings and drops out of the university. Again, Sergeant Bradley assumes Malik is at fault and lets Remy escape. Malik moves in with Fudge and his fellow roommates, while Remy moves in with Scott and his fellow Neo-Nazis. Fudge's gang wins a rumble against Scott's. Scott convinces Remy not to drop out of Columbus because the white supremacists need not only soldiers, but also educated people, such as lawyers, to fight for their cause. Yet Remy, intimidated by Malik, considers violence to be inevitable and therefore the only answer. When Remy insists that he is \"for real\", Scott shows him a collection of guns, including a [[Savage Model 110|sniper rifle]], which he keeps hidden in his dorm. Scott challenges Remy to kill for the [[White people|white race]].\n\nKristen and Monet organize a peace festival for their fellow students, with Malik and Deja attending. Remy opens fire, with Scott's rifle, from a rooftop. Deja is hit and dies in Malik's arms. Malik intercepts Remy and tries to strangle him to avenge Deja's death, but the campus police prevent him from doing this, and viciously beat Malik while Remy suffers a nervous breakdown. Remy tearfully apologizes for all that he has done and then turns his gun on himself before Sergeant Bradley can stop him, and commits suicide. Shortly after, Moss and his gang hear the news about Remy's actions and death and start chanting neonazi mottos.\n\nA few days later, Malik and Phipps discuss his future at the university. Phipps displays his trust in Malik's judgment. Later, Malik and Kristen - who is also taking Phipps' course but has never spent time with Malik until today - chat near a statue of [[Christopher Columbus]] which has been converted into a memorial site. Kristen feels responsible for Deja's death because it was Monet's and her Peace Fest, but Malik insists she's not.\n\nFudge and Taryn (among others) graduate from Columbus University, with the CU flag girls performing for their commencement-ceremony. The film's closing shot finds Phipps strolling from his office underneath the United States flag fluttering in the wind; the caption \"unlearn\" is typewritten over the flag.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Omar Epps]] as Malik Williams\n* [[Kristy Swanson]] as Kristen Connor\n* [[Michael Rapaport]] as Remy \n* [[Ice Cube]] as \"Fudge\" White\n* [[Jennifer Connelly]] as Taryn\n* [[Tyra Banks]] as Deja\n* [[Regina King]] as Monet\n* [[Jason Wiles]] as Wayne\n* [[Cole Hauser]] as Scott Moss\n* [[Busta Rhymes]] as \"Dreads\"\n* [[Laurence Fishburne]] as Professor Maurice Phipps\n* [[Bradford English]] as Officer Bradley\n* [[Jay R.
