It was critically acclaimed and nominated for several awards, including the [[Academy Award for Best Animated Feature]], the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Foreign Language Film]], and the [[Japan Academy Prize for Animation of the Year]].\n\n== Plot ==\n[[File:Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Oe Factory Tokei-dai 20150517.JPG|thumb|Mitsubishi aircraft manufacturing factory, [[Nagoya]]]]\n[[File:Manpei hotel02s1440.jpg|thumb|Mampei Hotel, Karuizawa]]\n<!-- Per WP:FilmPlot, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 and 700 words. -->\nIn 1916, a young [[Jiro Horikoshi]] longs to become a pilot, but his nearsightedness prevents it. One night, he dreams of his idol, the Italian aircraft designer [[Giovanni Battista Caproni]], who tells him that he has never flown a plane in his life, and that building planes is better than flying them. Seven years later after [[World War I]] ended, Jiro is traveling by train to study aeronautical engineering at [[University of Tokyo|Tokyo Imperial University]] and meets a young girl, Naoko Satomi, traveling with her maid. When the [[1923 Great Kant\u014d earthquake|Great Kant\u014d earthquake]] hits, Naoko's maid's leg is broken and Jiro helps Naoko carry her to Naoko's family home, leaving without giving his name.\n\nIn 1925, Jiro graduates with his friend [[Kiro Honjo]] and both are employed at aircraft manufacturer [[Mitsubishi Group|Mitsubishi]], assigned to design a fighter plane, the [[Mitsubishi 1MF9]], for the [[Imperial Japanese Army|Imperial Army]]. During a test, it breaks apart in midair and is rejected. Dispirited about what he perceives as the backwardness of Japanese aircraft technology, Jiro is sent with Honjo to the [[Weimar Republic]] in 1929 to carry out technical research and obtain a production license for a [[Junkers G.38]] aircraft. Jiro dreams again of Caproni, who tells him that the world is better for the beauty of planes, even if humankind might put them to terrible purposes.\n\nIn early 1932, Jiro is promoted to chief designer for a fighter plane competition sponsored by the [[Imperial Japanese Navy|Imperial Navy]], but his design, the [[Mitsubishi 1MF10]], fails testing in 1933 and is rejected. Disappointed, he goes to a summer resort in [[Karuizawa, Nagano|Karuizawa]] to rest, where he meets Naoko again. [[The Magic Mountain#Castorp|Hans Castorp]], a German visitor privately critical of the Nazi regime, tells Jiro, who intends to visit [[Dessau]], that [[Hugo Junkers]] is in trouble for fighting [[Nazism]] and that Germany will go to war again and must be stopped.\n\nLater, Jiro asks Naoko's father for his blessing to marry her, and the two are engaged. However, Nahoko has [[tuberculosis]] and wants to wait until she recovers to marry. Castorp assists in the romance before fleeing arrest by the Japanese [[Special Higher Police|secret police]]. Wanted in connection with Castorp, Jiro hides at his supervisor's home while he works on a new fighter aircraft project for the Imperial Navy. Following a [[Pulmonary hemorrhage|lung hemorrhage]], Naoko recovers in a mountain [[sanatorium]] but cannot bear being apart from Jiro and returns to marry him. Jiro's sister Kayo, a doctor, warns Jiro that his marriage to Naoko will end tragically as tuberculosis is incurable. Though Naoko's health deteriorates, she and Jiro enjoy their time together.\n\nJiro leaves for the test flight of his new prototype aircraft, the [[Mitsubishi A5M]]. Knowing that she will die soon, Naoko returns to the sanatorium, leaving letters for Jiro, her family, and friends. At the test site, Jiro is distracted from his success by a gust of wind, suggesting Naoko's passing. In the summer of 1945, after Japan [[Surrender of Japan|lost]] [[World War II]], Jiro dreams of Caproni again, regretting that his aircraft was used for war. Caproni comforts him, saying that Jiro's dream of building beautiful aircraft was nonetheless realized. Naoko appears, encouraging her husband to live his life to the fullest. Jiro and Caproni walk together into their shared kingdom of dreams.\n\n== Voice cast ==\n<!--  It should be possible to put the English dub cast in the same order as the original. -->\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
