It was shot in the [[The Bahamas|Bahamas]]. The film was met with negative reviews and broke even at the box office.\n\n==Plot==\nMaster thief Max Burdett and his girlfriend, Lola Cirillo, steal the second of three famous diamonds, known as the [[Napoleon]] diamonds, from FBI Agent Stanley P. Lloyd. But Lloyd shoots Max before passing out from being gassed by the thieves. Max survives and tells Lola to get the diamond. She does, leaving in its place the one-dollar bill that she had received as a tip for washing the agents' windshield (while in disguise). Max and Lola then fly to [[Paradise Island]] in [[The Bahamas]].\n\nAgent Stanley P. Lloyd shows up 6 months later and accuses Burdett of planning to steal the third Napoleon diamond, which is on a cruise ship that will be docking for a week on the island. He denies this, and unwittingly turns the tables and befriends the frustrated detective Lloyd, showing him the pleasures that Paradise Island has to offer, even paying for the most expensive suite, the bridge suite, for as long as Lloyd is there. Lloyd, out of his element, adapts quickly to the easy-going [[Caribbean]] lifestyle and partners up with Sophie, a local constable, to try to capture Max at last when he steals the diamond, which Max visits and later gives in to the temptation to steal. Henri Moor\u00e9, a powerful, popular tycoon thought of by some as a gangster, learns of Burdett's impressive history as a thief and offers him additional island-life benefits and pleasures in return for stealing the diamond.\n\nBurdett, still wanting the diamond for himself, pretends to work with Moor\u00e9, and gives him a fake plan as to how he would steal the diamond (which he had earlier related to Stan), having no trouble keeping ahead of his nemesis in the meantime. Lola kicks Max out after he breaks his promise to spend their first sunset on her new deck she had been working on and after she finds out he lied about writing his vows to her. Max is forced to bunk with Stan, and they share their thoughts about each other's lives. The next morning, the authorities and Sophie discover them, revealing that Stan's FBI license is suspended. They team up to win back Sophie and Lola, but Max still gives in and uses the dive trip as a distraction to steal the diamond, which works perfectly when Moor\u00e9's man tries at the same time but is caught after the fake plan doesn't work. After the fallout, Lola leaves Max after Lloyd shoots Moor\u00e9 dead when he comes for the diamond. Max realizes his error, writes his vows, and manages to win back Lola at the airport before she leaves, proposing to her with \"the first diamond he ever bought\".\n\nThe next day, Max is met by Stan while celebrating, who reveals he set him up and let Max do all the work while he later recovered the diamond. Max concedes that his nemesis has won this time, and is simply happy to live out his life with Lola, watching sunsets with her. As Max and Lola are enjoying themselves on the beach, Max uses a remote control on Stan's car that has arrived at the airport, using it to mess with Stan, who quickly realizes what is going on and is unable to do anything about it. Lola asks Max if this is the \"last time\", which he agrees to.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Pierce Brosnan]] as Max Burdett\n* [[Salma Hayek]] as Lola Cirillo\n* [[Woody Harrelson]] as FBI Agent Stan Lloyd\n* [[Don Cheadle]] as Henri Moor\u00e9\n* [[Naomie Harris]] as Sophie\n* [[Rex Linn]] as FBI Agent Kowalski\n* [[Mykelti Williamson]] as FBI Agent Stafford\n* [[Troy Garity]] as Luc\n* [[Obba Babatund\u00e9]] as Zacharias\n* [[Michael Bowen (actor)|Michael Bowen]] as FBI Driver\n* [[Russell Hornsby]] as Jean-Paul, Moor\u00e9's bodyguard\n* [[Mark Moses]] as Lakers FBI Agent\n* [[Chris Penn]] as Rowdy Fan\n* [[Joel McKinnon Miller]] as Wendell\n* [[Alan Dale]] as Security Chief\n* [[No\u00e9mie Lenoir]] as Moor\u00e9's Girl\n* [[John Michael Higgins]] as Hotel Manager (uncredited)\n\nThe film also features several cameos, including [[Gary Payton]], [[Karl Malone]], [[Phil Jackson]], [[Jeff Garlin]], [[Dyan Cannon]], [[Edward Norton]], and [[Shaquille O'Neal]] as themselves.\n\n==Production==\n[[Paul Zbyszewski]]'s original screenplay for ''After the Sunset'' was discovered by producers [[Beau Flynn]] and [[Tripp Vinson]], both known for producing movies such as ''[[Tigerland]]'' (2000) and ''[[Requiem for a Dream]]'' (2000).
