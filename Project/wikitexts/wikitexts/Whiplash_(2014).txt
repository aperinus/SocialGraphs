The film was produced by [[Bold Films]], [[Blumhouse Productions]], and Right of Way Films.

Soon after, Right of Way Films and Blumhouse Productions helped Chazelle turn 15 pages of the script into an 18-minute [[short film]], also titled ''[[Whiplash (2013 film)|Whiplash]]''. The short film received acclaim after debuting at the [[2013 Sundance Film Festival]], which attracted investors to produce the complete version of the script. Filming took place in September 2013 throughout [[Los Angeles]] in the course of 17 days. The film explores concepts of perfectionism, dedication, success, and deconstructs the concept of ambition.\n\n''Whiplash'' premiered in competition at the [[2014 Sundance Film Festival]] on January 16, 2014, as the festival's opening film; it won the Audience Award and Grand Jury Prize for drama.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Cohen |first=Sandy |date=17 January 2014 |title=Sundance Film Festival 2014 opens with premiere of 'Whiplash,' Damien Chazelle's tale of a brutal drumming instructor and his protege |work=The Oregonian |agency=Associated Press |url=http://www.oregonlive.com/movies/index.ssf/2014/01/sundance_film_festival_2014_op.html |url-status=live |access-date=January 18, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180720081226/https://www.oregonlive.com/movies/index.ssf/2014/01/sundance_film_festival_2014_op.html |archive-date=July 20, 2018}}</ref> The film opened in limited release domestically in the United States and Canada on October 10, 2014, gradually expanding to over 500 screens and finally closing on March 26, 2015. The film received widespread critical acclaim for its screenplay, direction, film editing, sound mixing, and Teller's and Simmons' performances, and grossed $49 million on a $3.3 million budget, making it Chazelle's highest grossing feature until the release of ''[[La La Land]]'' (2016). The film received multiple awards and nominations, winning [[Academy Awards]] for [[Academy Award for Best Film Editing|Best Film Editing]] and [[Academy Award for Best Sound Mixing|Best Sound Mixing]], and also being nominated for [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]] and [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Adapted Screenplay]]. Simmons' portrayal of Fletcher won him the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor|Academy]], [[BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role|BAFTA]], [[Critics' Choice Movie Award for Best Supporting Actor|Critics' Choice]], [[Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor \u2013 Motion Picture|Golden Globe]] and [[Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Supporting Role|Screen Actors Guild]] awards for Best Supporting Actor.\n\n==Plot==\nAndrew Neiman is a first-year student and jazz drummer at the prestigious Shaffer Conservatory in [[New York City]], hoping to one day fulfill his childhood goals and leave a legacy like that of his idol [[Buddy Rich]]. He is recruited by Terence Fletcher, the conductor and bandleader of the Shaffer Conservatory Studio Band, to play in Fletcher's ensemble as an alternate for core drummer Carl Tanner. Andrew quickly discovers that Fletcher is relentlessly strict, ruthless, and violent to his students; he physically and verbally attacks Andrew when he fails to keep tempo during the ensemble's rehearsal of [[Hank Levy]]'s \"Whiplash\".\n\nDetermined to impress Fletcher, Andrew practices until his hands bleed. In a jazz competition, after their first set, Andrew misplaces Carl's sheet music. When called for their second set, Carl insists that he can't play without his sheet music, but Andrew declares that he can perform the second set, \"Whiplash,\" from memory. After a successful performance, Fletcher promotes Andrew to the core drummer for the Studio Band. Fletcher also enlists Ryan Connolly, the core drummer from a lower-level ensemble within the conservatory.\n\nAs a result of his single-mindedness and Fletcher's teaching, Andrew's relationship with his family begins to deteriorate. After Fletcher promotes Connolly to core drummer, Andrew continues practicing to his limit, breaking up with his girlfriend Nicole in order to focus solely on drumming. After a grueling five-hour practice session with Tanner and Connolly, Andrew eventually earns back the core position.\n\nOn the way to the next competition, the bus Andrew is riding breaks down. He rents a car but arrives late and realizes he left his sticks at the rental office. After convincing Fletcher to wait for him, Andrew races back and retrieves them, but his car is hit by a truck on the way back. Injured, Andrew crawls from the wreckage and runs back to the theater just as the ensemble enters stage. He struggles to play \"[[Caravan (1936 song)|Caravan]]\" due to his injuries, and Fletcher halts the performance to dismiss him. Enraged, Andrew attacks Fletcher onstage but is pulled away by security and expelled from Shaffer.\n\nAt his father's request, Andrew meets a lawyer representing the parents of Sean Casey, a former student of Fletcher, who committed [[suicide by hanging]] due to depression and anxiety caused by Fletcher's abuse. Casey's parents want Fletcher forbidden from teaching, and Andrew agrees to testify anonymously, leading Shaffer to terminate Fletcher.\n\nFollowing his expulsion, Andrew abandons drumming and begins working in a restaurant. He visits a jazz club and encounters Fletcher playing piano. Fletcher claims his methods were solely intended to motivate promising students, referencing the story of how [[Charlie Parker#Biography|Charlie Parker rose to fame]]. He invites Andrew to perform with his band at the [[JVC Jazz Festival]], assuring him that the songs will be the same ones played by the Studio Band; Andrew hesitantly accepts. Andrew calls Nicole and invites her to the performance, but she has started a new relationship.\n\nAt JVC, before the band begins their first piece, Fletcher reveals that he knows Andrew testified against him and got him fired from his position. As revenge, Fletcher leads the band with a song Andrew does not know and for which he has not been given the sheet music. After attempting to perform, Andrew walks offstage humiliated but returns and cuts off Fletcher's introduction to the next piece by playing \"Caravan\", cueing in the band himself. Initially angered, Fletcher resumes conducting. Andrew plays his part perfectly, and Fletcher begins enjoying the piece as it goes on. As the piece finishes, Andrew continues playing into an extended solo. Fletcher nods in approval of Andrew's performance before cueing the band finale.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Miles Teller]] as Andrew Neiman, an ambitious young jazz drummer at Shaffer\n* [[J. K.
