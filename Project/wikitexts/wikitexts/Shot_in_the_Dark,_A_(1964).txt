It is the second installment in ''[[The Pink Panther]]'' film series, with [[Peter Sellers]] reprising his role as [[Inspector Clouseau|Inspector Jacques Clouseau]] of the French [[S\u00fbret\u00e9]].\n\nClouseau's blundering personality is unchanged, but it was in this film that Sellers began to give him the idiosyncratically exaggerated French accent that was to later become a hallmark of the character. The film also marks the first appearances of [[Herbert Lom]] as his long-suffering boss, [[List of The Pink Panther characters|Commissioner Dreyfus]], as well as [[Andr\u00e9 Maranne]] as Dreyfus's assistant Fran\u00e7ois and [[Burt Kwouk]] as Clouseau's stalwart manservant [[List of The Pink Panther characters|Cato]], all three of whom would become series regulars. [[Elke Sommer]] portrays the murder suspect, Maria Gambrelli. The character of Gambrelli would return in ''[[Son of the Pink Panther]]'' (1993), this time played by [[Claudia Cardinale]], who appeared as Princess Dala in ''[[The Pink Panther (1963 film)|The Pink Panther]]'' (1963). [[Graham Stark]], who portrays police officer Hercule Lajoy, would reprise this role eighteen years later, in ''[[Trail of the Pink Panther]]'' (1982).\n\nThe film was not originally written to include Clouseau, but was an adaptation of a stage play by [[Harry Kurnitz]] adapted from a French play ''[[L'Idiote]]'' by [[Marcel Achard]].<ref>''[http://www.ibdb.com/production.asp?id=2887 A Shot in the Dark]'' by Marcel Achard and adapted by Harry Kurnitz had a 1961-1962 [[Broadway theater|Broadway]] run, directed by [[Harold Clurman]]. Its cast included [[Julie Harris (American actress)|Julie Harris]], [[Walter Matthau]], and [[William Shatner]].</ref> The film was released only a year after the first Clouseau film, ''The Pink Panther'', the biggest difference being that, without David Niven, Clouseau is the main character and not Niven's foil.  \n\n== Plot ==\nLate at night at the country home of millionaire Benjamin Ballon, several of its occupants are moving about rooms, hiding and spying on others. The household consists of: Ballon's wife Dominique; Henri Lafarge, the head [[butler]], and his wife Madame Lafarge, the cook; Miguel Ostos, the head chauffeur; Pierre, the second chauffeur, and his wife Dudu, the head maid; Georges the gardener, and his wife Simone, the second maid; Maria Gambrelli, the third maid; and Maurice, the second butler. The night's events soon end with gunshots in the room of Maria, and Miguel found murdered. [[Inspector Clouseau]] of the [[National Police (France)|S\u00fbret\u00e9]], a bumbling and incompetent detective, is called out to the scene, accompanied by his assistant Hercule Lajoy. Suspicion is cast upon Maria, as she was found by Maurice clutching the gun that killed the victim. Before Clouseau can investigate further, his superior Commissioner Dreyfus removes him from the investigation out of fear he will bungle a high-profile case.\n\nThe following day, while training with his manservant Cato under a strict unplanned arrangement between them, Closeau finds himself returned to the investigation after Dreyfus is ordered by his superiors to do so, through Ballon's political influence. In discussion with Hercule about the murder, Clouseau asserts that Maria is innocent despite the evidence against her, but believes she is protecting the real killer whom he suspects might be Ballon himself. To keep her under surveillance during the investigation he arranges for her release from prison. However, two more murders occur - George in the Ballon's greenhouse; and Dudu at a nudist camp - with the evidence pointing towards Maria in each case. Despite the facts, Clouseau continues to believe she is innocent, which leaves Dreyfus dismayed at his incompetence in the case and the scandals he causes. After the body of Henri is found in the closet of Maria's bedroom, Clouseau is once more removed from the case.\n\nAlthough Dreyfus begins to suspect Ballon is trying to cover up facts about the murder, assuming that he is shielding someone with Maria's help, Clouseau's theory about her innocence leaves him worried that he could be undone. When he is forced to put him back on the case, he eventually suffers a [[nervous breakdown]] upon hearing of him going out for the evening with Maria. That night, several attempts are made on Clouseau's life at various establishments, including his apartment, but all of these fail while resulting in the death of several innocent bystanders. The increased notoriety of the case as a result of the incidents, coupled with proving Clouseau's theory correct, slowly cause Dreyfus to become unhinged.\n\nClouseau finally decides to confront the Ballon household over the murders, hoping to trick the murderer into unmasking themselves. However, his plan unexpectedly proves Maria innocent in all three murders - Dominique reveals she killed Miguel by mistake, believing he was her husband whom she thought was having an affair; Madame LaFarge murdered George because he was about to break up with her; Simone killed Dudu in order to maintain her affair with Pierre; and Ballon murdered Henri because he was having an affair with his wife. In the chaos that ensures, Clouseau's plan comes to its climax when Hercule cuts the lights, forcing the guilty parties to flee and escape in Clouseau's car, unaware that Dreyfus, who had been trying to get rid of Clouseau, had a set a bomb in it. All guilty parties are killed when the bomb detonates and blows up the car. Believing everyone was innocent, despite what they had confessed to, Dreyfus loses his sanity and is dragged away by Hercule. Clouseau, embracing Maria, finally declares her innocent, but a passionate kiss between the two is swiftly interrupted when Cato makes a sneak attack on them.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Peter Sellers]] as [[Inspector Jacques Clouseau]]\n* [[Elke Sommer]] as Maria Gambrelli\n* [[Herbert Lom]] as Commissioner Charles Dreyfus\n* [[George Sanders]] as Monsieur Ballon\n* [[Graham Stark]] as Hercule Lajoy\n* [[Andr\u00e9 Maranne]] as [[List of The Pink Panther characters|Fran\u00e7ois]]\n* [[Martin Benson (actor)|Martin Benson]] as Maurice\n* [[Burt Kwouk]] as [[List of The Pink Panther characters|Cato]]{{efn|Credited as Kato}}\n* [[Tracy Reed (English actress)|Tracy Reed]] as Dominique Ballon\n* [[Moira Redmond]] as Simone\n* [[Vanda Godsell]] as Madame LaFarge\n* [[Maurice Kaufmann]] as Pierre\n* [[Ann Lynn]] as Dudu\n* [[David Lodge (actor)|David Lodge]] as Georges\n* [[Douglas Wilmer]] as Henri LaFarge\n* [[Reginald Beckwith]] as Receptionist\t\n* [[Bryan Forbes]] as Camp Attendant{{Efn|Credited as Turk Thrust}}\n* Andr\u00e9 Charrise as Game Warden{{Efn|Credited as Andr\u00e9 Charise}}\n* Howard Greene as Gendarme\n* John Herrington as The Doctor\n* [[Jack Melford]] as The Psycho-Analyst\n* Victor Baring as Taxi Driver\n* [[Victor Beaumont]] as Gendarme\n* [[Tutte Lemkow]] as Cossack Dancer{{Efn|Mis-spelt in credits as \"Kazak Dancer\"}}\n* Hurtado De Cordoba Ballet as Flamenco Dancers & Guitarist\n* Fred Hugh as Balding Customer\n* [[Rose Hill (actress)|Rose Hill]] as Soprano\n* Tahitian Dance Group as Tahitian Dance Group\n{{div col end}}\n\n== Production ==\nSellers was attached to star in the adaptation of Harry Kurnitz's Broadway hit before the release and success of ''The Pink Panther'', but was not pleased with the script by Alec Coppel and Norman Krasna. Walter Mirisch approached Blake Edwards and asked him to take over as director of ''A Shot in the Dark'' from Anatole Litvak. Edwards declined initially, but eventually relented under pressure on the condition he could rewrite the script and substitute Inspector Clouseau for the lead character and choreograph comic scenes on the fly as he and Sellers had successfully done for their previous film.<ref>Blake Edwards DVD director's commentary, ''The Pink Panther'' (1964), MGM Movie Legends DVD release 2007</ref> The relationship between Edwards and Sellers deteriorated to such a point that at the conclusion of the film they vowed never to work together again. They eventually reconciled to collaborate successfully four years later on ''[[The Party (1968 film)|The Party]]'', and on three more \"Pink Panther\" films in the 1970s.\n\nTaking inspiration from his teacher [[Ed Parker]] in martial arts, Edwards created the new character Cato Fong using the [[American Kenpo]] style. Parker briefly worked alongside Edwards learning more about cinematography and suggested that he implement slow motions at certain fight scenes in order to increase the dramatic effect and make the moves more noticeable for audiences. Following a favorable response from viewers, Edwards continued to use this effect in following Pink Panther films.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Blake Edwards and the Martial Arts |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YNcDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA10 |magazine=[[Black Belt (magazine)|Black Belt]] |issue=13 |publisher=Patrick Sternkopf |date=June 1990 |page=10}}</ref>\n\nAs with most of the other Clouseau films, ''A Shot in the Dark'' features an [[animation|animated]] opening titles sequence produced by [[DePatie-Freleng Enterprises]] utilizing an animated version of Inspector Clouseau. This film and ''[[Inspector Clouseau (film)|Inspector Clouseau]]'' are the only Clouseau films not to feature the [[Pink Panther (character)|Pink Panther]] character in the opening titles. Henry Mancini's theme for this film serves as opening theme and incidental music in ''[[The Inspector]]'' cartoon shorts made by DePatie-Freleng from 1965 to 1969.\n\nThe title song 'The Shadows of Paris' was written by [[Henry Mancini]]. The singer is not credited but contemporary trade reports confirm it was [[Decca Records]] recording artist Gina Carroll.<ref>{{Citation|title=Gina Carroll - Bye Bye Big Boy|url=http://www.45cat.com/record/f12297|access-date=2021-06-03}}</ref>\n\n== Reception ==\n[[Bosley Crowther]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote, \"It is mad, but the wonderful dexterity and the air of perpetually buttressed dignity with which Mr. Sellers plays his role make what could quickly be monotonous enjoyable to the end.\"<ref>{{cite journal |last=Crowther |first=Bosley |author-link=Bosley Crowther |date=June 24, 1964 |title=Screen: Re-enter Sellers, the Sleuth |journal=[[The New York Times]] |page=28 }}</ref> ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' wrote: \"Wisdom remains to be seen of projecting a second appearance of the hilariously inept detective so soon after the still-current firstrun showing of 'Panther,' since some of the spontaneous novelty may have worn off, but the laughs are still there abundantly through imaginative bits of business and a few strike belly proportions.\"<ref>{{cite journal |date=June 24, 1964 |title=A Shot In The Dark |journal=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |page=6 }}</ref> Philip K.
