In the film, Boris the Animal, an old enemy of Agent K, escapes from prison and travels back in time to kill the younger K in order to allow his species, a ruthless alien race known as Boglodites, to attack Earth. This forces Agent J to go back in time and team up with K's younger self to save his partner and the world.

A standalone sequel in the series, ''[[Men in Black: International]]'', was released on June 14, 2019.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per [[WP:FILMPLOT]], this section should be 400-700 words ONLY. Please keep the plot summary concise. Thank you. -->\nIn 2012, alien criminal Boris the Animal, the last Boglodite, escapes from a maximum-security prison on the [[Moon of Earth|Moon]] to take revenge on [[Agent K]], who shot off his left arm and captured him in 1969. He confronts K and his partner [[Agent J]], telling the former he is \"already dead\". Back at MiB Headquarters, J discovers K was responsible not only for capturing Boris but for deploying the \"ArcNet\", a shield that prevented the Boglodites from conquering Earth, leading to their extinction.\n\nBoris travels back in time to July 16, 1969 to kill the young Agent K, altering history. With only J's memory somehow unaffected, no one else at the Agency understands his inquiries and knowledge regarding K until Agent O, the new Chief of MIB following Zed's death, eventually pieces together J's erratic actions as signs of a fracture in the [[space-time continuum]]. With K gone, the ArcNet was never deployed, and present-day Earth is defenseless from a Boglodite invasion.\n\nKnowing from the Agency's records Boris will commit murder at [[Coney Island]] on July 15, 1969, J time travels to said date to kill Young Boris. However, he is arrested by young K, who takes him to MiB Headquarters and prepares to neuralyze him, but decides at the last minute to investigate his claims that he traveled from the future to stop Boris. They follow clues, leading them to a bowling alley, and then [[The Factory]], where undercover MiB agent [[Andy Warhol]] directs them to Griffin, the last Archanan after the Boglodites destroyed his planet.\n\nGriffin, who can see all possible future timelines and outcomes, senses Boris' coming attack on The Factory, but tells J and K where to meet him so he can give them the ArcNet before he flees. They meet Griffin at [[Shea Stadium]], after which he is captured by Boris. J and K pursue and rescue Griffin, acquiring the ArcNet. Young Boris escapes and Old Boris arrives on the early morning of July 16 and they team up.\n\nAfter K initially badly takes the news of what Old Boris will do to him, he, J, and Griffin use jetpacks to fly to [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station|Cape Canaveral]] to attach the ArcNet onto the [[Apollo 11]] rocket to deploy it in space, but end up getting arrested by the military. Griffin shows a skeptical colonel the future, revealing to him the importance of their mission, and he assists them in getting to the launch site.\n\nAs the agents climb up the rocket's launch tower, they are attacked by both Borises. J uses his time-travel device to evade Old Boris' attacks and knocks him off the launch tower. K shoots off Young Boris' left arm, knocking him off of the tower while also restoring the timeline. K attaches the ArcNet to the rocket and it is deployed successfully when the rocket launches, with Old Boris incinerated by the rocket exhaust.\n\nYoung Boris attacks K on the beach leading to the launch site, but the colonel saves K by sacrificing himself. Boris tries to goad K into arresting him so history will repeat itself, but K kills him instead, breaking the cycle. The colonel's young son James arrives and when he inquires about his father, K neuralyzes him and tells him only that his father is a hero. Observing from afar, J realizes that ''he'' is James and that K has been watching over him his whole life, and his being there was why the space-time fracture did not alter his memory.\n\nWith his mission complete, J returns to 2012, where he reconciles with K, who tells him the Boglodites have been extinct for forty years while J implies his new knowledge of the secret K has been hiding to protect him and thanks him. The un-aged Griffin observes this, and breaking the [[fourth wall]], says it is his new favorite moment in human history. <!-- The ending joke does not affect the plot.
