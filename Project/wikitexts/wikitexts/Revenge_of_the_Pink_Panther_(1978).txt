It is the sixth film in ''[[The Pink Panther]]'' comedy film series. Released in 1978, it is the final on-set performance of [[Peter Sellers]] in the role of Inspector [[Jacques Clouseau]]. It was also the last installment in the series that was distributed solely by [[United Artists]].\n\n== Plot ==\nPhilippe Douvier, a major businessman and secretly the head of the [[French Connection]], is suspected by his New York Mafia drug trading partners of weak leadership and improperly conducting his criminal affairs. To demonstrate otherwise, Douvier's aide Guy Algo suggests a show of force with the murder of the famous Chief Inspector Jacques Clouseau.\n\nDouvier's first attempt at bombing Clouseau fails, and the subsequent attempt by Chinese martial artist 'Mr. Chong' is thwarted when Clouseau fights him off, believing him to be Clouseau's [[valet]] Cato, who has orders to keep his employer alert with random attacks. Douvier tries again by posing as an informant to lure Clouseau into a trap, but [[transvestite]] criminal Claude Russo steals Clouseau's car and clothes and is mistakenly killed instead by Douvier's men.\n\nClouseau is believed to be dead, prompting Clouseau's ex-boss, former Chief Inspector Charles Dreyfus, to regain his sanity and be released from the lunatic asylum to conduct the investigation. In Russo's clothes and protesting his true identity, Clouseau is himself taken to the asylum but escapes into Dreyfus' room, who faints from the shock of seeing Clouseau alive. Clouseau disguises himself as Dreyfus and is driven home by Fran\u00e7ois.\n\nAt home, Clouseau finds Cato, who, despite having turned Clouseau's apartment into a Chinese-themed [[brothel]], is relieved to see that he survived and the two plan [[revenge]] on the sponsor of Clouseau's [[assassination]]. Dreyfus is assigned to read a [[eulogy]] at Clouseau's funeral, during which his efforts to suppress hysterical laughter at the  words praising Clouseau's brilliance cause everyone to believe he is devastated by Clouseau's death. Clouseau attends the burial disguised as a priest, and surreptitiously reveals himself to Dreyfus, who faints and falls into the grave.\n\nDouvier's wife threatens him with divorce over his unfaithfulness. Needing her respectability, Douvier breaks off his affair with his secretary Simone. She reacts angrily. Fearing she will expose him, Douvier orders she be killed at her nightclub. Acting on a tip-off, Clouseau and Cato inadvertently save her. Clouseau reveals his identity to Simone and she reveals it was Douvier who ordered Clouseau's assassination. Fleeing Douvier's henchmen, she tells him of Douvier's plan to meet the New York Mafia godfather Julio Scallini in [[Hong Kong]] for the Gannet Transaction - a $50,000,000 heroin sale.\n\nClouseau, Cato, and Simone journey to Hong Kong in disguise, unaware that Dreyfus is following them after overhearing their conversation. Clouseau impersonates Scallini while Simone distracts the real one, but one of Scallini's men spots Douvier leaving their hotel with a stranger, and Clouseau exposes his own disguise during the Gannet Transaction. Dreyfus, intent on killing Clouseau and followed by the gangsters, Cato, Simone and the [[Hong Kong Police Force|Hong Kong Police]], chases Clouseau into a warehouse and accidentally lights up the [[fireworks]] stored inside, catching all involved parties in the resulting chaos. Douvier and Scallini are arrested, Clouseau is awarded for their arrest by the President of France, and he and Simone spend an evening together.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Peter Sellers]] as Chief [[Inspector Jacques Clouseau]]\n* [[Dyan Cannon]] as Simone Legree\n* [[Burt Kwouk]] as [[List of The Pink Panther characters#Cato Fong|Cato Fong]]\n* [[Robert Webber]] as Philippe Douvier\n* [[Herbert Lom]] as [[List of The Pink Panther characters#Chief Inspector Charles LaRousse Dreyfus|Chief Inspector Charles Dreyfus]]\n* [[Tony Beckley]] as Guy Algo\n* [[Andr\u00e9 Maranne]] as Sgt.

He suggested that ''Revenge of the Pink Panther'' should primarily be made up of this footage and that he would write and shoot new footage around it with Sellers and company. Sellers balked at this and insisted that ''Revenge'' feature all new footage. Sellers' contract for ''Revenge'' gave him story approval, which is why that film carries a story credit for Sellers that none of the previous films had.\n\nThe opening animated titles in the film were designed by [[DePatie-Freleng Enterprises]], who had been involved with the series since the animated titles of the original 1963 film, ''[[The Pink Panther (1963 film)|The Pink Panther]]''.<ref name=whodoneit>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cjuyCQAAQBAJ&q=the+pink+panther+marvel+productions&pg=PA72|title=Whodoneit!
