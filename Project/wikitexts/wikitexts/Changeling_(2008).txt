It stars [[Angelina Jolie]] as a woman united with a boy who she realizes is not her missing son. When she tries to demonstrate this to the police and city authorities, she is vilified as delusional, labeled as an unfit mother and confined to a psychiatric ward. The film explores themes of child endangerment, female disempowerment, political corruption, mistreatment of mental health patients and the repercussions of violence.\n\nWorking in 1983 as a special correspondent for the now defunct ''TV-Cable Week'' magazine, Straczynski first encountered the story of [[Christine Collins]] and her son from a Los Angeles City Hall contact.<ref>\"Becoming Superman\" by J.Michael Straczynski, pages 227-228; copyright 2019 by Synthetic Worlds, LTD; HarperCollins Publisher</ref> Over the ensuing years he kept researching the story but never felt he was ready to tackle it. Out of television writing for several years and practically blacklisted in the industry because he was considered difficult to work with, he returned to researching and then finally writing the story in 2006.<ref>\"Becoming Superman\" by J.Michael Straczynski, pages 382-394; copyright 2019 by Synthetic Worlds, LTD; HarperCollins Publisher</ref>  Almost all of the film's script was drawn from thousands of pages of documentation.<ref group=\"Note\">Straczynski described 95% of the script as being drawn from around 6,000 pages of documentation.</ref> His first draft became the [[shooting script]]; it was his first film [[screenplay]] to be produced. [[Ron Howard]] had intended to direct the film, but scheduling conflicts led to his replacement by Eastwood. Howard and his [[Imagine Entertainment]] partner [[Brian Grazer]] produced ''Changeling'' alongside [[Malpaso Productions]]' [[Robert Lorenz]] and Eastwood. [[Universal Pictures]] financed and distributed the film.\n\nSeveral actors campaigned for the leading role; ultimately, Eastwood decided that Jolie's face would suit the 1920s period setting. The film also stars [[Jeffrey Donovan]], [[Jason Butler Harner]], [[John Malkovich]], [[Michael Kelly (American actor)|Michael Kelly]] and [[Amy Ryan]]. While some characters are [[composite character|composites]], most are based on actual people. [[Principal photography]], which began on October 15, 2007 and concluded a few weeks later in December, took place in Los Angeles and other locations in [[southern California]]. Actors and crew noted that Eastwood's low-key direction resulted in a calm set and short working days. In [[post production]], scenes were supplemented with computer-generated skylines, backgrounds, vehicles and people.\n\n''Changeling'' premiered to critical acclaim at the [[2008 Cannes Film Festival|61st Cannes Film Festival]] on May 20, 2008. Additional festival screenings preceded a limited release in the United States on October 24, 2008, followed by a general release in North America on October 31, 2008; in the United Kingdom on November 26, 2008; and in Australia on February 5, 2009. Critical reaction was more mixed than at Cannes. While the acting and story were generally praised, the film's \"conventional staging\" and \"lack of nuance\" were criticized. ''Changeling'' earned $113&nbsp;million in box-office revenue worldwide\u2014of which $35.7&nbsp;million came from the United States and Canada\u2014and received nominations in three [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] and eight [[British Academy Film Awards|BAFTA Award]] categories.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=changeling08.htm |title=Changeling |publisher=BoxOfficeMojo.com |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090601150907/http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=changeling08.htm |archive-date=June 1, 2009 }}</ref>\n\n== Plot ==\nIn [[Los Angeles]] in 1928, single mother [[Christine Collins]] returns home to discover that her nine-year-old son, Walter, is missing. Reverend Gustav Briegleb publicizes Christine's plight and rails against the [[Los Angeles Police Department]] (LAPD) for its incompetence, corruption and the [[extrajudicial punishment]] meted out by its \"Gun Squad,\" led by [[James E. Davis (police)|Chief James E. Davis]]. Several months after Walter's disappearance, the LAPD tells Christine that the boy has been found alive. Believing the positive publicity will negate recent criticism of the department, the LAPD organizes a public reunion. Although \"Walter\" claims he is Christine's son, she says he is not. Captain J.J. Jones, the head of the LAPD's Juvenile Division, insists the boy is Walter and pressures Christine into taking him home \"on a trial basis.\"\n\nAfter Christine confronts Jones with physical discrepancies between \"Walter\" and her son, in particular that her son was several inches taller and uncircumcised. Unconvinced by her statements, Captain Jones arranges for a medical doctor to visit her. The doctor tells Christine that \"Walter\" is three inches shorter than before his disappearance because trauma has shrunk his spine and that the man who took Walter must have had him [[Circumcision|circumcised]]. A newspaper prints a story implying that Christine is an unfit mother; Briegleb tells Christine it was planted by police to discredit her. Both Walter's teacher and his dentist give Christine signed letters asserting that \"Walter\" is an impostor. Christine tells her story to the press; as a result, Jones sends her to [[Los Angeles County-USC Medical Center|Los Angeles County Hospital]]'s \"[[Psychiatric ward|psychopathic ward]]\". She befriends inmate Carol Dexter, who tells Christine she is one of several women who were sent there for challenging police authority. Dr. Steele diagnoses Christine as delusional and forces her to take mood-regulating pills. Steele says he will release Christine if she admits she was mistaken about \"Walter.\" She refuses.\n\nDetective Ybarra travels to a ranch in [[Mira Loma, California|Wineville]], [[Riverside County, California|Riverside County]], to arrange the deportation of 15-year-old Sanford Clark to [[Canada]]. The boy's uncle named [[Gordon Stewart Northcott]], has fled after a chance encounter with Ybarra, who mentions his business there as being a juvenile matter. Clark tells Ybarra that Northcott forced him to help kidnap and murder around twenty children and he identifies Walter as one of them. Jones tells Briegleb that Christine is in protective custody following a mental breakdown. Jones orders Clark's deportation, but Ybarra takes Clark to the murder site and tells him to dig where the bodies are buried. Clark hesitates, but he soon uncovers body parts. Briegleb secures Christine's release by showing Steele a newspaper story about the Wineville killings that names Walter as a possible victim. Under interrogation by Ybarra, Walter's impostor reveals that his motive was to secure transport to Los Angeles to see his favorite actor, [[Tom Mix]] and says the police told him to lie about being Christine's son. The police capture Northcott in [[Vancouver|Vancouver, British Columbia]], Canada. Meanwhile, Briegleb introduces Christine and her case to famed attorney \"S.S.\" Hahn, who takes the case [[pro bono]] and quickly secures a court order for the release of other unjustly imprisoned women whom the police wanted to silence.\n\nOn the day of the city council's hearing in the case, Christine, Hahn and Briegleb arrive at Los Angeles City Hall, where they encounter thousands of protesters demanding answers from the city and decrying the LAPD. The hearing is intercut with scenes from Northcott's trial. The council concludes that Jones and Davis should be removed from duty and that extrajudicial internments by police must be stopped. Northcott's jury finds him guilty of murder and the judge sentences him to death by hanging.\n\nTwo years later, Christine has still not given up her search for Walter. Northcott sends her a message saying he is willing to admit to killing Walter on condition that Christine meets him before his execution. She visits Northcott, but he refuses to tell her if he killed her son. Northcott is executed the next day.\n\nIn 1935 David Clay, one of the boys assumed to have been killed, is found alive in [[Hesperia, California]]. He reveals that one of the boys with whom he was imprisoned was Walter and that Walter, another boy, and he escaped but were separated. David does not know whether Walter was recaptured, but he says Walter helped him escape, giving Christine hope that he could still be alive.\n\nIn the epilogue, we learn that after the hearing Captain Jones was suspended, Chief Davis was demoted and Los Angeles Mayor [[George E. Cryer|George Cryer]] chose not to run for re-election; that California's [[state legislature]] made it illegal to forcibly commit people to psychiatric facilities based solely on the word of authorities; that Rev. Briegleb continued to use his radio show to expose police misconduct and political corruption; that Wineville is said to have changed its name to [[Mira Loma]] to escape the stigma of the murders; and that Christine Collins reportedly never stopped searching for her son.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Angelina Jolie]] as [[Christine Collins]]\n* [[John Malkovich]] as Reverend Gustav Briegleb\n* [[Jeffrey Donovan]] as Captain J.J.

One was the sequence set in the psychopathic ward, for which there was only limited after-the-fact testimony.<ref name=\"amc\"/> Straczynski originally wrote a shorter account of Collins' incarceration. His agent suggested the sequence needed development, so Straczynski extrapolated events based on standard practice in such institutions at the time. It was at this stage he created composite character Carol Dexter, who was intended to symbolize the women of the era who had been unjustly committed.<ref name=\"creative\"/> Straczynski cited his academic background, including [[Academic major|majors]] in psychology and sociology, as beneficial to writing the scenes, specifically one in which Steele distorts Collins' words to make her appear delusional.<ref name=\"wga\"/> Straczynski worked at making the dialogue authentic, while avoiding an archaic tone. He cited his experience imagining alien psyches when writing ''[[Babylon 5]]'' as good practice for putting himself in the cultural mindset of the 1920s.<ref name=\"creative\"/>\n\nStraczynski described specific visual cues in the screenplay, such as in Sanford Clark's confession scene. Clark's flashback to a falling axe is juxtaposed with the crumbling ash from Detective Ybarra's cigarette. The image served two purposes: it was an aesthetic correlation between the axe and the cigarette, and it suggested that Ybarra was so shocked by Clark's confession that he had not moved or even smoked in the 10 minutes Clark took to tell his story. As with most of the cues, Eastwood shot the scene as written.<ref name=\"creative\"/> To ensure the veracity of the story, Straczynski incorporated quotes from the historical record, including court testimony, into the dialogue. He also included photocopies of news clippings every 15\u201320 pages in the script to remind people the story was a true one.<ref name=\"notes\"/> So the credits could present the film as \"a true story\" rather than as \"based on\" one, Straczynski went through the script with Universal's legal department, providing attribution for every scene.<ref name=\"cruz\">{{cite magazine|url=http://www.time.com/time/arts/article/0,8599,1852963,00.html |title=Q&A: Changeling Writer J.

Stern referenced a large book of period images. He attempted to evoke [[Conrad Hall]]'s work on [[Great Depression|Depression]]-set film ''[[The Day of the Locust (film)|The Day of the Locust]]'', as well as match what he called the \"leanness\" of ''[[Mystic River (film)|Mystic River]]''{{'}}s look. Stern said the challenge was to make ''Changeling'' as simple as possible to shoot. To focus more on Jolie's performance, he tended to avoid the use of [[fill light]]ing.<ref name=\"asc\"/> Eastwood did not want the flashbacks to Northcott's ranch to be too much like a horror film\u2014he said the focus of the scene was the effect of the crimes on Sanford Clark\u2014so he avoided graphic imagery in favor of casting the murders in shadow.<ref name=\"andrew\">{{cite journal | title=Changeling Man | author=Geoff Andrew | journal=[[Sight & Sound]] | issn= 0037-4806 | page=17 | volume=18 | issue=9 | date=September 2008 }}</ref>\n\nStern shot ''Changeling'' in [[anamorphic format]] on [[35mm movie film|35mm film]] using [[List of motion picture film stocks#VISION color negative (ECN-2 process 1996\u20132002)|Kodak Vision 500T 5279]] film stock. The film was shot on [[Panavision]] cameras and C-Series lenses. Due to the large number of sets, the lighting rigs were more extensive than on other Eastwood productions. The crew made several ceilings from bleached [[muslin]] tiles. Stern lit the tiles from above to produce a soft, warm light that was intended to evoke the period through tones close to antique and [[Sepia (color)|sepia]]. The crew segregated the tiles using fire safety fabric Duvatyn to prevent light spilling onto neighboring clusters. The [[key light]] was generally softer to match the warm tones given off by the toplights. Stern used stronger [[skypan]]s\u2014more intense than is commonly used for key lighting\u2014to reduce contrasts when applying daytime rain effects, as a single light source tended to produce harder shadows.<ref name=\"asc\"/>\n\nStern lit scenes filmed at the Park Plaza Hotel using dimmable [[hydrargyrum medium-arc iodide lamp|HMI]] and tungsten lights rigged within [[balloon light]]s. This setup allowed him to \"dial in\" the color he wanted, as the blend of tones from the tungsten fixtures, wooden walls and natural daylight made it difficult to illuminate the scenes using HMIs or daylight exclusively. Stern said the period setting had little effect overall on his lighting choices because the look was mostly applied in the production design and during [[digital intermediate]] (DI), the post-production digital manipulation of color and lighting. [[Thomson SA|Technicolor Digital Intermediates]] carried out the DI. Stern supervised most of the work via e-mailed reference images as he was in Russia shooting another film at the time. He was present at the laboratory for the application of the finishing touches.<ref name=\"asc\"/>\n\n===Visual effects===\n\n====Overview====\n[[File:Los Angeles City Hall (color) edit2.jpg|thumb|200px|upright|alt=A tall, white, stone building set against a cloudless blue sky.

The team's work began with research into 1928 Los Angeles; they referenced historical photographs and data on the urban core's population density.<ref name=\"vfx\"/> CIS had to generate mostly new computer models, textures and motion capture because the company's existing effects catalog consisted primarily of modern era elements.<ref name=\"cg\"/> CIS supplemented exteriors with skylines and detailed backdrops.<ref name=\"notes\"/> They created set extensions digitally and with matte paintings.<ref name=\"cg\"/> CIS created city blocks by using shared elements of period architecture that could be combined, rearranged and restacked to make buildings of different widths and heights; that way, the city could look diverse with a minimum of textural variation. CIS referenced vintage aerial photographs of downtown Los Angeles so shots would better reflect the geography of the city, as Hancock felt it important to have a consistency that would allow audiences to understand and become immersed in the environment.<ref name=\"vfx\"/>\n\nTo maintain the rapid shooting pace Eastwood demanded, Owens chose to mostly avoid using [[Chroma key|bluescreen]] technology, as the process can be time-consuming and difficult to light. He instead used [[rotoscoping]], the process whereby effects are drawn directly onto live action shots.<ref name=\"cg\"/> Rotoscoping is more expensive than bluescreen, but the technique had proved reliable for Eastwood when he made extensive use of it on ''[[Flags of Our Fathers (film)|Flags of Our Fathers]]''&nbsp;(2006) to avoid shooting against bluescreen on a mountaintop. For Owens, the lighting was better, and he considered rotoscoping to be \"faster, easier and more natural\".<ref name=\"vfx\"/> Owens used bluescreen in only a few locations, such as at the ends of backlot streets where it would not impact the lighting.<ref name=\"cg\"/> The Universal Studios backlot had been used for so many films that Owens thought it important to disguise familiar architecture as much as possible, so some foreground and middle distance buildings were swapped. One of his favorite effects shots was a scene in which Collins exits a taxi in front of the police station. The scene was filmed almost entirely against bluescreen; only Jolie, the [[sidewalk]], the taxi cab and an extra were real. The completed shot features the full range of effects techniques used in the film: digital extras in the foreground, set extensions and computer-generated vehicles.<ref name=\"vfx\"/>\n\n====Digital extras====\nFor crowd scenes, CIS supplemented the live-action extras with digital pedestrians created using motion capture.<ref name=\"vfx\"/> House of Moves captured the movements of five men and four women during a two-day shoot supervised by Hancock.<ref name=\"vfx2\"/> The motion capture performers were coached to make the \"small, formal and refined\" movements that Owens said reflected the general public's conduct at the time.<ref name=\"vfx\"/><ref name=\"cg\"/> CIS combined the motion data with the [[Massive (software)|Massive]] software package to generate the interactions of the digital pedestrians. The use of Massive presented a challenge when it came to blending digital pedestrians with live-action extras who had to move from the foreground into the digital crowd.<ref name=\"cg\"/> Massive worked well until this stage, when the effects team had to move the digital pedestrians to avoid taking the live-action extras out of the shot.<ref name=\"vfx\"/> To allow close-ups of individual Massive extras, the effects team focused on their faces and walking characteristics. Hancock explained, \"We wanted to be able to push Massive right up to the camera and see how well it held up. In a couple of shots the characters might be 40 feet away from the camera, about 1\u20445 screen height. The bigger the screen is, the bigger the character. He could be 10 feet tall, so everything, even his hair, better look good!\"<ref name=\"cg\"/> Typically, a limited number of motion performances are captured and Massive is used to create further variety, such as in height and walking speed. Because the digital extras were required to be close to the foreground,<ref name=\"vfx2\"/> and to integrate them properly with the live action extras, House of Moves captured twice as much motion data than CIS had used on any other project.<ref name=\"vfx\"/> CIS created nine distinct digital characters. To eliminate inaccuracies that develop when creating a digital extra of different proportions to the motion capture performer, CIS sent nine skeleton rigs to House of Moves before work began. This gave House of Moves time to properly adapt the rigs to its performers, resulting in motion capture data that required very little editing in Massive.<ref name=\"vfx2\"/> CIS wrote [[shader]]s for their clothing; [[displacement mapping|displacement maps]] in the air shader were linked with the motion capture to animate wrinkles in trousers and jackets.<ref name=\"vfx\"/>\n\n====Closing sequence====\n[[File:Changeling closing sequence.png|300px|thumb|alt=Elevated daytime view of a busy city crossroads, looking down one street along which a series of tall buildings recede into the distance. Pedestrians line the sidewalks, cars litter the streets; a bright red electric streetcar features in the foreground|In the final shot, the perspective slowly lifts to take in the city scene. The sequence was introduced to give the audience room for emotional reflection after previous versions of the film ended with a [[Fade (lighting)|cut to black]].<ref name=\"cg\"/> The streetcars, tracks, power lines and most of the extras were computer generated.<ref name=\"vfx\"/> The buildings in the distance were created digitally with [[matte painting]]s.<ref name=\"cg\"/>]]\nForgoing the [[Closure (psychology)|closure]] favored by its contemporaries, ''Changeling''{{'}}s final sequence reflects Collins' renewed hope that Walter is alive.<ref name=\"cg\"/><ref name=\"hanks\"/> The shot is a two and a half minute sequence showing Collins' walking off to become lost in a crowd.<ref name=\"cg\"/> The sequence is representative of the range of effects that feature throughout the film; Los Angeles is presented as major character,<ref name=vfx/> brought to life by unobtrusive peripheral imagery that allows the viewer to focus on the story and the emotional cues. The \"hustle and bustle\" of the sequence was required to convey that downtown Los Angeles in 1935 was a congested urban center. In the closing shot, the camera tilts up to reveal miles of city blocks,<ref name=\"cg\"/> pedestrians on the streets, cars going by and streetcars running along their tracks.<ref name=\"vfx\"/> The version of the film that screened at [[Cannes Film Festival|Cannes]] did not include this sequence; the scene faded to black as Collins walked away. The new 4,000-frame shot was Owens' idea. He felt the abrupt cut to black pulled the viewer out of the film too quickly, and that it left no room for emotional reflection. Owens said, \"There is a legend at the end before the credits. The legend speaks to what happened after the fact, and I think you need to just swallow that for a few moments with the visual still with you.\" Owens told Eastwood the film should end like ''[[Chinatown (1974 film)|Chinatown]]''&nbsp;(1974), in which the camera lifts to take in the scene: \"The camera booms up and she walks away from us from a very emotional, poignant scene at the end, walks away into this mass of people and traffic. It's very hopeful and sad at the same time.\"<ref name=\"cg\"/>\n\nOwens did not have time to complete the shot before the Cannes screenings, but afterwards he used [[cineSync]] to conduct most of the work from home. The shot includes two blocks of computer-generated buildings that recede into the distance of a downtown set extension. As Collins disappears into the crowd about a minute into the shot, the live footage is gradually joined with more digital work.<ref name=\"cg\"/> The streetcars, tracks and power lines were all computer generated. Live-action extras appear for the first minute of the shot before being replaced by digital ones. The shot was made more complicated by the need to add [[Massive (software)|Massive]] extras.<ref name=\"vfx\"/> Owens constructed the scene by first building the digital foreground around the live action footage. He then added the background before filling the scene with vehicles and people.<ref name=\"cg\"/>\n\n===Music===\n{{main|Changeling (soundtrack)}}\nEastwood composed ''Changeling''{{'}}s [[jazz]]-influenced score. Featuring lilting guitars and strings, it remains largely low-key throughout. The introduction of [[brass instrument]]s evokes film noir, playing to the film's setting in a city controlled by corrupt police. The theme shifts from piano to a full orchestra, and as the story develops, the strings become more imposing, with an increasing number of [[sustain]]s and [[Melodic motion|rises]]. Eastwood introduces voices reminiscent of those in a horror film score during the child murder flashbacks.<ref name=\"musicmag\">{{cite news|url=http://www.filmmusicmag.com/?p=2110 |title=CD Review: Changeling\u2014Original Soundtrack |author=Daniel Schweiger |work=Film Music Magazine |publisher=Global Media Online |date=November 25, 2008 |access-date=November 26, 2008 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101231035040/http://www.filmmusicmag.com/?p=2110 |archive-date=December 31, 2010 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=95990500 |title='Changeling' Another Step In Eastwood's Evolution |author=Elizabeth Blair |work=[[National Public Radio]] |date=October 24, 2008 |access-date=April 23, 2009 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090317054011/http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=95990500 |archive-date=March 17, 2009 }}</ref> The score was orchestrated and conducted by [[Lennie Niehaus]].<ref>{{cite AV media notes|title=[[Changeling (soundtrack)|Changeling Soundtrack]]|others=[[Clint Eastwood]]|date=2008|type=CD liner|publisher=[[Var\u00e8se Sarabande]]|id=3020669342}}</ref> It was released on CD in North America on {{Nowrap|November 4}}, 2008, through record label [[Var\u00e8se Sarabande]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.varesesarabande.com/servlet/the-251/Changeling/Detail |title=Changeling: Product Details |work=varesesarabande.com |publisher=[[Var\u00e8se Sarabande]] |access-date=November 26, 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110105164849/http://www.varesesarabande.com/servlet/the-251/Changeling/Detail |archive-date=January 5, 2011 }}</ref>\n\n==Themes==\n\n===Disempowerment of women===\n''Changeling'' begins with an abduction, but largely avoids framing the story as a family drama to concentrate on a portrait of a woman whose desire for independence is seen as a threat to male-dominated society.<ref name=\"le monde\"/><ref name=\"liberation\"/> The film depicts 1920s Los Angeles as a city in which the judgment of men takes precedence; women are labeled \"hysterical and unreliable\" if they dare to question it.<ref name=\"honeycutt\"/> Rather than \"an expression of feminist awareness\", [[David Denby (film critic)|David Denby]] argues, the film\u2014like Eastwood's ''[[Million Dollar Baby]]''\u2014is \"a case of awed respect for a woman who was strong and enduring\".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2010/03/08/100308fa_fact_denby?currentPage=all#ixzz0hnyNNTgl |title=Out of the West |author=David Denby |magazine=[[The New Yorker]] |date=March 8, 2010 |access-date=March 10, 2010 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100307020408/http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2010/03/08/100308fa_fact_denby?currentPage=all |archive-date=March 7, 2010 }}</ref> The portrait of a vulnerable woman whose mental state is manipulated by the authorities was likened to the treatment of [[Ingrid Bergman]]'s character in ''[[Gaslight (1944 film)|Gaslight]]''&nbsp;(1944), who also wondered if she might be insane;<ref name=\"le monde\"/><ref>{{cite news|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090216215113/http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/files/2008/10/why-i-disagree.html|archive-date=February 16, 2009|url-status=dead|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/files/2008/10/why-i-disagree.html|author=Scott Feinberg|title='Changeling' and Angelina Jolie: Awards are not won on paper|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=October 7, 2008|access-date=October 9, 2008}}</ref> Eastwood cited photographs that show Collins smiling with the child she knows is not hers.<ref name=\"le monde\"/> Like many other women of the period who were deemed disruptive, Collins is forced into the secret custody of a mental institution. The film shows that psychiatry became a tool in the gender politics of the era, only a few years after [[History of women's suffrage in the United States|women's suffrage in the United States]] was guaranteed by the ratification of the [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Nineteenth Amendment]]. As women ceased to be second-class citizens and began to assert their independence, the male establishment used mental institutions in an effort to disempower them; in common with other unmanageable women, Collins is subjected to medical treatment designed to break her spirit and compel obedience, though some of the treatments, specifically the [[electroconvulsive therapy]] depicted in the film, did not exist ca. 1928\u20131930. The film quotes the testimony of the psychiatrist who treated Collins.

Eastwood argued that in putting the guilty party before his victims' families, justice may be done, but after such a spectacle the family would find it hard to find peace. The scene's realism was deliberate: the audience hears Northcott's neck breaking, his body swings and his feet shake.
