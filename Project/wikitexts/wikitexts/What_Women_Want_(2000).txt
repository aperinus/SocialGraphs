Henson]] and [[Aldis Hodge]].\n\n==Plot==\nNick Marshall, a [[Chicago]] advertising executive, was raised by his [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]] [[showgirl]] mother. Nick is a [[male chauvinism|chauvinist]] skilled at selling products to men and seducing women. He expects to get a promotion at the advertising firm Sloane Curtis, but his manager Dan instead announces that he is hiring Darcy Maguire to broaden the firm's appeal to women. Meanwhile, Nick's estranged 15-year-old daughter Alex is staying with him while his former wife Gigi is on her honeymoon with her new husband Ted. Nick embarrasses Alex, who resents his over-protectiveness when he meets her boyfriend Cameron, who is 18 years old.\n\nDarcy tasks the staff, including Nick, to develop advertising ideas for a series of feminine products she distributes at the staff meeting. While testing a few items at home, Nick falls into his bathtub while holding an electric [[hairdryer]], shocking himself, and is knocked unconscious. The next morning, Nick awakens to discover he has a new gift: he can hear women's thoughts. He has an [[epiphany (feeling)|epiphany]], realizing that most women, especially at work, dislike him and consider him sleazy. He makes an impromptu visit to his former therapist, Dr. Perkins (who also disliked him), and she encourages him to use his newfound ability to his advantage.\n\nNick telepathically eavesdrops on Darcy and purloins her ideas to use as his own, but gradually becomes attracted to her. Alex resents Nick's years of neglect, but they start to bond while he takes her shopping for a prom dress. After Nick telepathically finds out that Alex intends to sleep with Cameron the night of the prom, Nick attempts to give her some advice. He tells her Cameron is not interested in her for who she is, just for what he can do with her in bed. Alex, thinking Nick is being over-protective and trying to sabotage her prom, rejects his advice.\n\nNick and Darcy spend more time together, becoming romantic. However, he steals Darcy's idea for a new [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] [[ad campaign]] aimed at women, though he later regrets his actions, especially as it leads to Dan firing Darcy. Nick persuades Dan to rehire Darcy, saying the ad was her idea and is eventually successful.\n\nOver time, Nick succeeds in repairing his relationships with female acquaintances, especially those at work. Nick loses his gift during a severe thunder and lightning storm while on his way to see the company secretary, Erin, who has been contemplating suicide. He offers her a position for which he had previously turned her down; she accepts. When Cameron dumps Alex at the prom for refusing to have sex, Nick finds and consoles her, cementing their newly-repaired relationship. Nick visits Darcy and explains everything. She fires him, but then forgives him, and they share a kiss.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Mel Gibson]] as Nick Marshall: A Chicago advertising executive, who acquires the gift to hear what women are thinking.\n* [[Helen Hunt]] as Darcy Maguire: Nick's co-worker who later becomes his love interest.\n* [[Marisa Tomei]] as Lola: Nick's former love interest, who works in a coffee shop and is trying to become an actress.\n*[[Alan Alda]] as Dan Wanamaker, Nick's boss.\n* [[Ashley Johnson (actress)|Ashley Johnson]] as Alex Marshall: Nick's daughter, who comes to stay with him, while her mom Gigi and stepdad Ted go on their honeymoon.
