It is the first Bond film to be directed by [[Lewis Gilbert]], who later directed the 1977 film ''[[The Spy Who Loved Me (film)|The Spy Who Loved Me]]'' and the 1979 film ''[[Moonraker (film)|Moonraker]]'', both starring [[Roger Moore]]. The screenplay of ''You Only Live Twice'' was written by [[Roald Dahl]], and loosely based on [[Ian Fleming]]'s 1964 novel of the [[You Only Live Twice (novel)|same name]]. It is the first James Bond film to discard most of Fleming's plot, using only a few characters and locations from the book as the background for an entirely new story.\n\nIn the film, Bond is dispatched to [[Japan]] after American and Soviet crewed spacecraft disappear mysteriously in orbit, each nation blaming the other amidst the [[Cold War]]. Bond travels secretly to a remote Japanese island to find the perpetrators, and comes face-to-face with [[Ernst Stavro Blofeld]], the head of [[SPECTRE]]. The film reveals the appearance of Blofeld, who was previously a partially [[unseen character]]. SPECTRE is working for the government of an unnamed Asian power, implied to be the [[China|People's Republic of China]], to provoke war between the superpowers.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Black |first1=Jeremy |author-link=Jeremy Black (historian) |year=2005 |title=The Politics of James Bond: From Fleming's Novels to the Big Screen |publisher=[[University of Nebraska Press]] |isbn=978-0-8032-6240-9 |page=[https://archive.org/details/politicsofjamesb0000blac/page/122 122] |url=https://archive.org/details/politicsofjamesb0000blac/page/122}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.britmovie.co.uk/films/You-Only-Live-Twice |title=''You Only Live Twice'' |website=Britmovie.co.uk |access-date=15 February 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160529131200/http://www.britmovie.co.uk/films/You-Only-Live-Twice/ |archive-date=29 May 2016 |url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nDuring the filming in Japan, it was announced that Sean Connery would retire from the role of Bond, but after one film's absence, he returned in 1971's ''[[Diamonds Are Forever (film)|Diamonds Are Forever]]'' and later 1983's non-Eon Bond film ''[[Never Say Never Again]]''. ''You Only Live Twice'' received positive reviews and grossed over $111&nbsp;million in worldwide box office. However, it was the first ''Bond'' film to see a decline in box-office revenue, owing to the oversaturation of the spy film genre from ''Bond'' imitators, including a competing ''Bond'' film, ''[[Casino Royale (1967 film)|Casino Royale]]'', from [[Columbia Pictures]] (1967).\n\n== Plot ==\nAmerican [[NASA]] [[spacecraft]] [[Project Gemini|Jupiter 16]] is hijacked from orbit by an unidentified spaceship. The United States suspects it to be the work of the [[Soviets]], but the British suspect Japanese involvement since the spacecraft landed in the [[Sea of Japan]]. To investigate, [[Secret Intelligence Service|MI6]] operative [[James Bond (literary character)|James Bond]] is sent to Tokyo, after faking his own death in Hong Kong and being [[buried at sea]] from {{HMS|Tenby|F65|6}}.\n\nBond attends a [[sumo]] match where he is approached by Japanese secret service agent [[Aki (James Bond)|Aki]], who takes him to meet local MI6 operative Dikko Henderson. Henderson claims to have critical evidence about the rogue craft, but is killed before he can elaborate. Bond chases and kills the assailant, taking the assailant's clothing as a disguise, and is driven in the getaway car to Osato Chemicals. Once there, Bond subdues the driver and breaks into the office safe of the company's president, Mr. Osato. After obtaining secret documents, Bond is pursued by armed security, but is rescued by Aki, who flees to a secluded subway station. Bond chases her, but falls down a trap door leading to the office of the head of the Japanese secret service, [[List of James Bond allies#Tiger Tanaka|Tiger Tanaka]]. The stolen documents are examined, and found to include a photograph of the cargo ship ''Ning-Po'', with a [[microdot]] message saying the tourist who took the photo was killed as a security precaution.\n\nBond goes back to Osato Chemicals to meet Osato, masquerading as a potential buyer. Osato humors Bond, but after their meeting orders his secretary, Helga Brandt, to have him killed; both are [[SPECTRE]] agents. Outside the building, assassins open fire on Bond before Aki rescues him again. Bond and Aki drive to [[Kobe]], where the ''Ning-Po'' is docked. They investigate the company's dock facilities, and discover that the ship was delivering elements for [[rocket fuel]]. They are discovered, but Bond eludes the henchmen until Aki gets away; however, Bond is captured. He wakes, tied up in Brandt's cabin on the ''Ning-Po''. Brandt interrogates Bond, before seducing him. Brandt flies Bond to Tokyo the next day, but en route, she sets off a flare in the plane, seals Bond in his seat and bails out. Bond lands the plane and flees before it explodes.\n\nAfter finding out where the ''Ning-Po'' unloaded, Bond flies over the area in a heavily armed [[autogyro]] created by [[Q (James Bond)|Q]]. Near a [[volcano]], Bond is attacked by and defeats four helicopters, confirming his suspicions of a nearby base. A Soviet spacecraft is captured in orbit by another unidentified craft, heightening tensions with the United States. The mysterious spaceship lands in an extensive base hidden inside the volcano, operated by [[Ernst Stavro Blofeld]] of SPECTRE, who has been hired by a [[great power]] to start a Soviet-American war. Blofeld summons Osato and Brandt to his quarters for not having killed Bond; Osato blames Brandt, and as she leaves, Blofeld drops her to her death into a pool filled with [[piranha]]s. Blofeld then orders Osato to kill Bond.\n\n[[File:Ch\u00e2teau de Himeji02.jpg|thumb|The [[Himeji Castle]], location of the ninjas' training.]]\n\nAt Kyoto, Bond prepares to conduct a closer investigation of the island by training with Tanaka's ninjas and donning a Japanese disguise, which will include a staged marriage to an Ama diving girl. Aki is inadvertently poisoned to death by a SPECTRE assassin targeting Bond and he is then introduced to Tanaka's student, [[Kissy Suzuki]] who will play the part of his wife. Acting on Kissy's lead, the pair reconnoitre a cave booby-trapped with phosgene gas, and the volcano above it. Establishing that the mouth of the volcano is a disguised hatch to the secret rocket base, Bond slips in, while Kissy goes to alert Tanaka. Bond locates and frees the captured American and Soviet astronauts and, with their help, steals a [[space suit]] to infiltrate the SPECTRE spacecraft, \"Bird One\". However, Blofeld spots Bond, and he is detained while Bird One is launched. Bond is taken into the control room where he meets Blofeld, who kills Osato to demonstrate the price of failure.\n\nBird One closes in on an American space capsule, and U.S. forces prepare to launch a nuclear attack on the USSR. Meanwhile, Tanaka's ninjas approach the base's entrance, but are detected and fired upon. Bond distracts Blofeld and lets in the ninjas. During the battle, Tanaka saves Bond by disarming Blofeld with his [[shuriken]]. Bond fights his way to the control room, tosses Blofeld's bodyguard into the piranha pool, and activates Bird One's [[self-destruct]] before it reaches the American craft. As the Americans stand down their forces, Blofeld activates the base's self-destruct system and escapes. Bond, Kissy, Tanaka, and the surviving ninjas leave before the eruption destroys the base, and are picked up by the [[Japanese Navy|Japanese Maritime Forces]] and the British Secret Service.\n\n== Cast ==\n[[File:007volcanocrater blofeld.jpg|alt=Large, underground missile silo with a missile pointing out the hole toward the sky next to a support structure.

Other directors have such an ego that they want to rewrite it and put their own dialogue in, and it's usually disastrous.

The initial scenes are set in and around the [[Ginza]] area. The [[Hotel New Otani Tokyo]] served as the outside for Osato Chemicals, and the hotel's gardens were used for scenes of the [[ninja]] training. A car chase using the [[Toyota 2000GT#2000GT Open-Top, the \"Bond Model\"|Toyota 2000GT]] and a [[Toyota Crown#S40|Toyota Crown]] was largely filmed in the area around the [[Olympic Stadium, Tokyo|Olympic Stadium]] used previously for the [[1964 Summer Olympics]]. [[Tokyo Tower]] and the centre of Tokyo can be briefly seen in a sequence where the villain's car is dropped in Tokyo Bay. Tanaka's private subway station was filmed at the [[Tokyo Metro]]'s [[Nakano-shimbashi Station]]. A sumo wrestling match was filmed at Tokyo's sumo hall, the [[Kuramae Kokugikan]]; this has since been demolished.\n* [[Port of Kobe|Kobe Docks]] appears in a sequence when Bond investigates the ship ''Ning-Po'', and is involved in a fight.\n* Bond's wedding at a Shinto Shrine was filmed in [[Nachikatsuura|Nachi]].\n* [[Himeji Castle]] in [[Hy\u014dgo Prefecture]] was depicted as Tanaka's ninja training camp.\n* The village of [[Minamisatsuma|Bonotsucho Akime]] was where Bond and his Ama wife lived and where the Ama scenes were shot.\n* The ryokan Shigetomi-so (now known as Shimazu Shigetomisoh Manor) was used as the exterior of Tanaka's house.\n* [[Kagoshima Prefecture]] was the location for various scenes depicting Little Nellie (see below).\n* Mount [[Shinmoedake|Shinmoe-dake]] in [[Kyushu|Ky\u016bsh\u016b]] was used for the exteriors of SPECTRE's headquarters.<ref name=\"MGM documentary\">{{cite AV media |title=Inside You Only Live Twice: An Original Documentary |medium=Television |people=Production Staff |publisher =MGM Home Entertainment Inc |year=2000}}</ref><ref name=\"On Location With Ken Adam\">{{cite AV media |title=On Location With Ken Adam |location=You Only Live Twice: Ultimate Edition DVD (Disc 2) |publisher=MGM Home Entertainment}}</ref><ref name=\"exotic\">{{cite AV media |title=Exotic Locations |location=You Only Live Twice: Ultimate Edition DVD (Disc 2) |publisher=MGM Home Entertainment}}</ref>\n\nMost of the interiors were shot at Pinewood. The opening sequence in Hong Kong used some location footage of a street in [[Kowloon]]. Hong Kong's Victoria Harbour is also shown, but the at-sea burial of Bond and the retrieval of the corpse was filmed off Gibraltar and the Bahamas. The scenes with the light aircraft ferrying Bond to his supposed death were shot over very English-looking countryside in Buckinghamshire, whereas this was supposed to be Japan.\n\nLarge crowds were present in Japan to see the shooting. A Japanese fan began following Sean Connery with a camera, and police had to deal with fan incursions several times during shooting.<ref name=\"MGM documentary\" /><ref name=\"commentary\">{{cite AV media |title=You Only Live Twice [[audio commentary|Commentary track]] |medium=DVD |publisher=MGM Home Entertainment Inc |year=2000}}</ref>\n\nThe heavily armed [[Wallis WA-116 Agile|WA-116]] [[autogyro]] \"Little Nellie\" was included after Ken Adam heard a radio interview with its inventor, [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] Wing Commander [[Ken Wallis]].

Wallis piloted his invention, which was equipped with various mock-up armaments by [[John Stears]]' special effects team, during production.<ref name=booklet/>\n\n\"Nellie\"'s battle with helicopters proved to be difficult to film. The scenes were initially shot in [[Miyazaki Prefecture|Miyazaki]], first with takes of the gyrocopter, with more than 85 take-offs, five hours of flight and Wallis nearly crashing into the camera several times. A scene filming the helicopters from above created a major [[Vertical draft|downdraft]], and cameraman John Jordan's foot was severed by the craft's rotor.
