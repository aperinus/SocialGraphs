His first mission there is to find a young [[radar]] technician who had been separated from his squad some days earlier. While on the search, his [[helicopter]] is shot down and he is taken as a prisoner of war, but is assumed to have been killed in action and is reported dead to his family. His wife Sarah (Nielsen) and younger brother Jannik (Kaas) both deeply mourn him, and that brings them closer together. They kiss once, but pass it off as grief and do not pursue the relationship.\n\nMeanwhile, both the officer and a young technician are locked up in a warehouse, kept without food or water. After Michael shows them how to arm and disarm an anti-aircraft missile, his captors decide the technician is no longer useful and have Michael bludgeon him to death with a lead pipe in order to save his own life. Eventually he is rescued and brought back to Denmark. The guilt of what he did forces him to lie and provide false hope that the technician may still be alive.\n\nMichael becomes unstable, spiraling down into a pit of guilt and rage, and begins to threaten and abuse his wife and tear the house apart. It finally becomes necessary for the police to intervene. Michael overreacts, pointing a policeman's pistol at the officers. After Michael is taken into custody, Jannik helps Sarah begin the repairs on the house. Later, Sarah visits Michael in prison, where he breaks down and finally admits the truth about what he did in Afghanistan.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Connie Nielsen]] as Sarah\n* [[Ulrich Thomsen]] as Michael\n* [[Nikolaj Lie Kaas]] as Jannik\n* [[Sarah Juel Werner]] as Natalia (daughter)\n* Rebecca L\u00f8gstrup as Camilla (daughter)\n* [[Bent Mejding]] as Henning\n* [[Solbj\u00f8rg H\u00f8jfeldt]] as Else\n* [[Niels Olsen]] as Allentoft\n* {{ill|Paw Henriksen|da}} as Niels Peter\n* [[Lars Hjortsh\u00f8j]] as Preben 2\n* [[Lars Ranthe]] as Preben 1\n* Andr\u00e9 Babikian as Slobodan\n* {{ill|Lene Maria Christensen|da}} as J.
