[[Canadians|Canadian]] filmmakers [[Mark Achbar]] and [[Peter Wintonick]] expand the analysis of [[political economy]] and [[mass media]] presented in ''[[Manufacturing Consent]]'', a 1988 book Chomsky wrote with [[Edward S. Herman]].\n\n==Overview==\nThe film presents and illustrates Chomsky and Herman's [[propaganda model]] thesis that corporate media, as profit-driven institutions, tend to serve and further the agendas and interests of dominant, elite groups in the society. A centerpiece of the film is a long examination of the history of ''[[The New York Times]]''' coverage of the [[Indonesian occupation of East Timor]], which Chomsky says exemplifies the media's unwillingness to criticize an ally of the elite.\n\nUntil the release of ''[[The Corporation (2003 film)|The Corporation]]'' (2003), made by [[Mark Achbar]], [[Jennifer Abbott]] and [[Joel Bakan]], it was the most successful feature documentary in Canadian history playing theatrically in over 300 cities around the world. It appeared in more than 50 international film festivals where it received 22 awards. It was broadcast on television in over 30 markets and translated into a dozen languages.\n\nChomsky confessed in an on-stage interview at the 2013 [[Doc NYC|New York City Documentary festival]] that he has never actually seen the documentary because \"I can't stand watching myself...but I'm told it was a pretty impressive film.\"<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFnQrOi-9T0 'Noam Chomsky on Peter Wintonick']</ref> In a published conversation with Achbar and several activists, he stated that \"the positive impact of it has been astonishing to me\" but people mistakenly get the impression that he is the leader of a movement that they should join. He also criticizes ''The New York Times'' review of the film, which mistakes his message for being a call for voter organizing rather than for engaging in media critique and political action.<ref>Noam Chomsky (2002).

The New Press.</ref>\n\n==Companion book==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2011}}\n[[Mark Achbar]] edited a companion book of the same name.<ref>Peter Wintonick and Mark Achbar, ''Manufacturing Consent: Noam Chomsky and the Media'', Montreal: Black Rose Books, 1995.</ref> It features a transcript of the film annotated with excerpts from referenced and relevant materials as well as several comments from [[Chomsky]] interspersed throughout. Eighteen \"Philosopher All-Stars\" [[baseball card]]s (as seen in the film) are also included. On the back of each card is a short summary of the person, titles of their major works, and a series of quotations attributed to the individual. The people featured as cards in the set are: [[Ren\u00e9 Descartes]], [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], [[Voltaire]], [[Mary Wollstonecraft]], [[Wilhelm von Humboldt]], [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]], [[Sojourner Truth]], [[Karl Marx]], [[Sitting Bull]], [[Rosa Luxemburg]], [[Peter Kropotkin]], [[Emma Goldman]], [[Mahatma Gandhi]], [[Martin Luther King Jr.]], [[Bertrand Russell]], [[Michel Foucault]], and [[Noam Chomsky]]. The book made the Globe and Mail national bestseller list in Canada.\n\nThe first half of the book, hyperlinked to the relevant portions of the film's audio, is available online from ''[[Z Magazine]]''. The entire book is available as a [[PDF]] document on the [[DVD region code#2|Region 2]] [[DVD]] of the film.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Concentration of media ownership]]\n* [[Propaganda model]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|id=0104810|title=Manufacturing Consent: Noam Chomsky and the Media}}\n* {{webarchive |url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20020914233053/http%3A//zmag.org/chomsky/mc/ |title=The first half of the book |date=2002-09-14}}\n* {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041009221526/http://www.zeitgeistfilms.com/film.php?directoryname=manufacturingconsent |title=Zeitgeist Films (US distributor) page for the film |date=2004-10-09}}\n* [http://www.nfb.ca/collection/films/fiche/?id=54601 NFB Web page]\n* [http://www.wmin.ac.uk/mad/page-2203 The Herman-Chomsky Propaganda Model Twenty Years On] ''Westminster Papers in Communication and Culture'' 6(2), 2009\n\n===Multimedia===\n\n* {{Internet Archive film|id=dom-25409-manufacturingconsentnoamchomsk}}\n\n{{Noam Chomsky}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Manufacturing Consent: Noam Chomsky And The Media}}\n[[Category:1992 films]]\n[[Category:Australian documentary films]]\n[[Category:Finnish documentary films]]\n[[Category:Norwegian documentary films]]\n[[Category:English-language Canadian films]]\n[[Category:Documentary films about public opinion]]\n[[Category:Canadian documentary films]]\n[[Category:Works about the information economy]]\n[[Category:National Film Board of Canada documentaries]]\n[[Category:Documentary films about writers]]\n[[Category:Documentary films about journalism]]\n[[Category:1992 documentary films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Peter Wintonick]]\n[[Category:Works about Noam Chomsky]]\n[[Category:Films based on non-fiction books]]\n[[Category:1990s English-language films]]\n[[Category:1990s Canadian films]]"}]}}}}
