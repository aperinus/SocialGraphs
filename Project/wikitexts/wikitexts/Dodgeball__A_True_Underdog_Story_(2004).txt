The plot follows a group of misfits entering a Las Vegas [[dodgeball]] tournament to save their cherished local gym from the onslaught of a corporate health fitness chain. The film was theatrically released by [[20th Century Fox]] on June 18, 2004. It received generally positive reviews from critics and grossed $168.4 million on a $20 million budget.\n\n== Plot ==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries should not exceed 700 words -->\nPeter LaFleur owns Average Joe's, a small, dilapidated gym with only a few members. When he [[Default (finance)|defaults]] on the gym's [[Mortgage loan|mortgage]], Peter\u2019s business rival, the cocky and vindictive White Goodman, who owns Globo Gym across the street, purchases it. Goodman plans to [[Foreclosure|foreclose]] on Average Joe's and demolish it in order to build a new auxiliary parking structure for his members unless Peter can raise $50,000 in 30 days. Goodman attempts to seduce attorney Katherine \"Kate\" Veatch, who is handling his account. She is repulsed, and mentions her refusal to date clients due to a [[conflict of interest]] (COI) when rebuffing his advances.\n\nPeter, gym employees Dwight Baumgarten and Owen Dittman, and members Steve \"Pirate\" Cowan, Justin Redman, and Gordon Pibb, all band together to raise money. After an impromptu car wash suggested by Owen fails, Gordon suggests entering a dodgeball tournament in [[Las Vegas]] with a $50,000 prize. After watching a 1950s-era training video obtained by Justin featuring [[Irish-American]] dodgeball legend Patches O'Houlihan, the team takes part in the local qualifiers. [[Girl Scouts of the USA|Girl Scout]] Troop 417 easily defeats them, but are later disqualified due to one member's use of three separate types of [[anabolic steroid]]s and a low-grade beaver tranquilizer, effectively handing the win to Average Joe's by default.\n\nHaving spied on Average Joe's using a hidden camera in a cutout of himself sent to insult them, Goodman forms his own team, the Globo Gym Purple Cobras, surprising Gordon by revealing that his extremely personal friendship with the chancellor allowed him to join the tournament without a qualification match. After watching their confrontation, Patches, now a wheelchair-bound elderly man, approaches Peter, volunteering to coach the team. Patches' unusual training regimen includes throwing wrenches at the team, having them dodge oncoming cars, and constantly insulting them. Kate demonstrates skill at the sport but declines to join the team due to COI. Goodman shows up at Kate's house uninvited and announces that he misled her bosses about her drinking on the job, thus getting her fired from her law firm and freeing him to date her. Enraged, but now free of the COI, she rejects Goodman and joins the Average Joe's team to get back at him.\n\nAt the tournament, the team suffers early setbacks but manages to advance to the final round against Globo Gym. The night before the match, a falling sign in the casino kills Patches. Demoralized, and anxious that the team will lose without Patches to motivate them, Peter angrily tells Steve that he is not a pirate, causing Steve to leave the team. Returning to his room, Peter encounters Goodman, who greedily offers him $100,000 for the deed to Average Joe's, claiming that it will inevitably close and the team will have no one to blame but Peter. The day of the final round, Justin leaves to help his classmate and love interest Amber in a cheerleading competition, after his bully and rival Derek becomes severely injured, leaving Average Joe's short of players. Peter briefly encounters [[Lance Armstrong]], who restores his morale, and rejoins his team, but he and Justin return too late; Average Joe's has already forfeited the match. Gordon finds a loophole in the rules: a majority of the judges can overturn the forfeiture. [[Chuck Norris]] casts the tie-breaking vote, allowing the team to play.\n\nAfter an intense game, Peter and Goodman find themselves in a [[Sudden death (sport)|sudden-death]] match against each other. Inspired by Patches' spirit, Peter blindfolds himself, successfully dodges Goodman's throw and strikes him in the face, winning the championship and the prize money. To nullify the victory, Goodman reveals that Peter sold Average Joe's to him the previous night, but Peter reveals that he used Goodman's $100,000 to bet on Average Joe's to win; with the odds against them at 50 to 1, he collects $5 million. Since Globo Gym is a [[Public company|publicly traded company]], as Kate explains, Peter purchases a [[controlling interest]] in it, thus regaining Average Joe's, then publicly fires Goodman. Steve, now appearing more normal, returns and apologizes to Peter, but reverts to his pirate persona when Peter shows him their winnings, calling it \"buried treasure\". Peter is shocked when Joyce, a friend of Kate's, who caught an earlier flight from Guam to witness the final match, arrives and kisses her passionately. Kate then reveals her [[bisexuality]] and kisses Peter similarly. Kate becomes Peter's girlfriend, Justin and Amber get married with a baby on the way, and Owen begins dating Fran Stalinovskovichdaviddivichski from the Globo Gym team. Later on, Peter opens youth dodgeball classes at a newly renovated Average Joe's, while Goodman becomes morbidly obese, having drowned his depressions in junk food and blaming Norris for his plight.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{div col|colwidth=28em}}\n* [[Vince Vaughn]] as Peter \"Pete\" LaFleur\n* [[Christine Taylor]] as Katherine \"Kate\" Veatch\n* [[Ben Stiller]] as White Goodman\n* [[Rip Torn]] as Patches O'Houlihan\n** [[Hank Azaria]] as young Patches\n* [[Justin Long]] as Justin Redman\n* [[Stephen Root]] as Gordon Pibb\n* [[Alan Tudyk]] as \"Pirate\" Steve Cowan\n* [[Joel David Moore]] as Owen Dittman\n* [[Chris Williams (actor)|Chris Williams]] as Dwight Baumgarten\n* [[Missi Pyle]] as Fran Stalinovskovichdaviddivichski\n* [[Jamal Duff]] as Me'Shell Jones\n* [[Gary Cole]] as Cotton McKnight\n* [[Jason Bateman]] as Pepper Brooks\n* Al Kaplon as The Referee\n* [[William Shatner]] as The Dodgeball chancellor\n* [[Julie Gonzalo]] as Amber\n* Trever O'Brien as Derek\n* [[Rusty Joiner]] as Blade\n* Kevin Porter as Lazer\n* Brandon Molale as Blazer\n* [[Curtis Armstrong]] as Mr. Ralph\n* [[Scarlett Chorvat]] as Joyce\n* [[Lori Beth Denberg]] as Martha Johnstone\n* [[Cayden Boyd]] as Timmy\n* [[Bob Cicherillo]] as Rory (uncredited)<ref>{{Cite web |date=January 11, 2004 |title=Getbig Interview: Bob Cicherillo |url=https://www.getbig.com/iview/cicherillo040111.htm |access-date=January 5, 2021 |website=Get Big}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=MuscleMemory: Bodybuilders in the Movies |url=https://www.musclememory.com/movies/byBber.html |access-date=January 5, 2021 |website=MuscleMemory}}</ref>\n* [[Patton Oswalt]] as Video Store Clerk (uncredited)\n{{div col end}}\n;Cameo appearances\n* [[Lance Armstrong]] as himself<ref>{{Cite news |date=January 15, 2013 |title=Lance Armstrong ruined 'Dodgeball' |work=[[USA Today]] |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/gameon/2013/01/15/lance-armstrong-ruined-dodgeball/1837351/ |access-date=May 28, 2018}}</ref>\n* [[Chuck Norris]] as himself<ref>{{Cite news |last=Sternbergh |first=Adam |date=July 15, 2004 |title=Chuck Norris As Himself |work=Slate |url=http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/culturebox/2004/07/chuck_norris_as_himself.html |access-date=May 28, 2018 |issn=1091-2339}}</ref>\n* [[David Hasselhoff]] as himself, coach of the German team<ref>{{Cite news |date=October 6, 2015 |title=10 Things You Didn't Know About Dodgeball |work=IFC |url=https://www.ifc.com/comedy-crib/ball-or-nothing/blog/2015/10/10-things-you-didnt-know-about-dodgeball-a-true-underdog-story |access-date=May 28, 2018}}</ref>\n\n== Production ==\nWhen the film was screened to test audiences, the original ending had Average Joe's lose to Globo Gym in the final match.
