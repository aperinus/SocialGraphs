Retrieved February 22, 2012.</ref>\n}}\n\n'''''Moneyball''''' is a 2011 American [[sports drama film]] directed by [[Bennett Miller]] and written by [[Steven Zaillian]] and [[Aaron Sorkin]]. The film is based on the [[Moneyball|2003 nonfiction book]] by [[Michael Lewis]], an account of the [[Oakland Athletics]] [[baseball]] team's [[2002 Oakland Athletics season|2002 season]] and their general manager [[Billy Beane]]'s attempts to assemble a competitive team. In the film, Beane ([[Brad Pitt]]) and assistant general manager [[Paul DePodesta#Moneyball|Peter Brand]] ([[Jonah Hill]]), faced with the franchise's limited budget for players, build a team of undervalued talent by taking a sophisticated [[sabermetric]] approach to [[Scout (sport)|scouting]] and analyzing players.\n\n[[Columbia Pictures]] bought the rights to Lewis's book in 2004, hiring [[Stan Chervin]] to write the screenplay. [[David Frankel]] was initially set to direct with Zaillian now writing the screenplay, but was soon replaced by [[Steven Soderbergh]], who planned to make the film in a semi-documentary style featuring interviews from real athletes, and having the real players and coaches on the team portray themselves. But before its July 2009 filming start, the film was put in turnaround due to creative differences between Soderbergh and Sony over a last-minute script rewrite. Soderbergh exited, and Miller was hired to direct, with Pitt becoming a producer and Sorkin hired for rewrites. Filming began in July 2010 at various stadiums such as [[Dodger Stadium]] and [[Oakland Coliseum]].\n\n''Moneyball'' premiered at the [[2011 Toronto International Film Festival]] and was released on September 23, 2011, to box office success and critical acclaim, particularly for its acting and screenplay. The film was nominated for six [[Academy Awards]], including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Adapted Screenplay]], [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] for Pitt and [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Supporting Actor]] for Hill. It marks the second film to pair Pitt and Hill after both provided voice roles for the 2010 [[DreamWorks Animation]] film ''[[Megamind]]''.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Please be reasonable about this notice. Per WP:FILMPLOT, the plot summary should be 400-700 words. -->\n\n[[Billy Beane]], the [[General manager (baseball)|general manager]] of the [[Oakland Athletics]], is devastated by the team's loss to the [[New York Yankees]] in the [[2001 American League Division Series]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/postseason/2001_ALDS2.shtml|title = 2001 AL Division Series - New York Yankees over Oakland Athletics (3-2)}}</ref> With the impending departure of the star players [[Johnny Damon]], [[Jason Giambi]] and [[Jason Isringhausen]] to [[free agency]], Beane needs to assemble a competitive team for [[2002 Oakland Athletics season|2002]] with Oakland's limited budget.\n \nDuring a scouting visit to the [[Cleveland Indians]], Beane meets Peter Brand, a young Yale economics graduate with radical ideas about evaluating players. Beane asks whether Brand would have drafted him out of high school; though [[Scout (sport)|scouts]] considered Beane promising, his career in the [[Major League Baseball|major leagues]] was disappointing. Brand says he would not have drafted him until the ninth round. Impressed, Beane hires him.\n\nUsing Brand's [[Sabermetric|sabermetric]] method, Beane signs undervalued players such as [[Chad Bradford]], [[Jeremy Giambi]], [[Scott Hatteberg]], and also trades for [[David Justice]]. The Athletics' scouts are hostile toward the strategy, and Beane fires the head scout, [[Grady Fuson]], after a heated confrontation. Beane also faces opposition from [[Art Howe]], the Athletics' manager. Howe disregards Beane's and Brand's strategy and uses a more traditional lineup.\n \nEarly in the season, the Athletics are already ten [[games behind]] first, leading critics to dismiss the new method as a failure. Brand argues their [[Sample (statistics)|sample size]] is too small to conclude the method does not work, and Beane convinces the team owner, [[Stephen Schott]], to stay the course. To get help on defense, Beane trades Giambi to the [[Philadelphia Phillies|Phillies]] for [[John Mabry]] and the only traditional first baseman, [[Carlos Pe\u00f1a]], to the [[Detroit Tigers|Tigers]], leaving Howe no choice but to use the team Beane and Brand have designed. Three weeks later, the Athletics are only four games behind first.\n \nBefore the trade deadline, Beane acquires the [[relief pitcher]] [[Ricardo Rinc\u00f3n]] from the [[Cleveland Indians|Indians]], and on August 13, the Athletics start a winning streak. Beane, superstitiously, refuses to watch games in progress, but when the Athletics tie the [[American League]] record of 19 consecutive wins, his daughter persuades him to attend the next game against the [[Kansas City Royals]]. Oakland is leading 11\u20130 when Beane arrives in the fourth inning, only to watch the Royals even the score. Thanks to a [[walk-off home run]] by Hatteberg, the Athletics achieve a then record-breaking 20th consecutive win. Beane tells Brand he will not be satisfied until they have changed baseball by winning the [[World Series]].\n \nThe Athletics win the 2002 [[American League West]] but lose to the [[Minnesota Twins]] in the [[2002 American League Division Series|American League Division Series]]. The owner of the [[Boston Red Sox]], [[John W. Henry]], realizes that sabermetrics is the future of baseball. He asks Beane to become the Red Sox general manager for a $12.5 million salary, which would make him the highest-paid general manager in sports history. In Oakland, Beane discloses the offer to Brand and says their strategy failed. Brand shows a video of a heavyset batter, [[Jeremy Brown]], who hits a home run but does not realize it. In his car, Beane listens to a song recorded by his daughter in which she tells him to \"just enjoy the show\".\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Brad Pitt]] as [[Billy Beane]]\n* [[Jonah Hill]] as Peter Brand, partially based on [[Paul DePodesta#Moneyball|Paul DePodesta]]\n* [[Philip Seymour Hoffman]] as [[Art Howe]]\n* [[Robin Wright]] as Sharon Beane\n* [[Chris Pratt]] as [[Scott Hatteberg]]\n* [[Stephen Bishop (actor)|Stephen Bishop]] as [[David Justice]]\n* [[Reed Diamond]] as [[Mark Shapiro (sports executive)|Mark Shapiro]]\n* [[Brent Jennings]] as [[Ron Washington]]\n* [[Ken Medlock]] as [[Grady Fuson]]\n* [[Jack McGee (actor)|Jack McGee]] as Rocco\n* [[Vyto Ruginis]] as [[Chris Pittaro]]\n* [[Nick Searcy]] as [[Matt Keough]]\n* [[Glenn Morshower]] as Ron Hopkins\n* [[Casey Bond]] as [[Chad Bradford]]\n* Nick Porrazzo as [[Jeremy Giambi]]\n* [[Kerris Dorsey]] as Casey Beane\n* [[Arliss Howard]] as [[John W.

It was also stated that the studio now felt the film was too \"arty\" for its $58 million budget. Soderbergh was said to be unwilling to compromise, leaving Sony chairwoman [[Amy Pascal]] \"apoplectic\".
