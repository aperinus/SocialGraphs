Lead character \"George\" is fired from her job at Happy Time and ends up revealing her identity to her sister, Reggie. George's fellow reapers confront Kane and find that he knows and does not care that their departure from the job rules is causing misfortune elsewhere. Unhappy with his leadership, they try various ways to end his existence. George gets her Happy Time job back, and the reapers await a new boss.\n\n[[Laura Harris]] was unavailable to return as Daisy Adair, and [[Sarah Wynter]] replaced her. The rest of the returning cast reprised their roles, with new character Cameron Kane played by [[Henry Ian Cusick]]. The film was released on [[DVD]] on February 17, 2009, one month after its debut on Canada's [[Super Channel (Canadian TV channel)|Super Channel]].\n\n==Plot==\nA crew of \"reapers\", whose job is to extract the souls of people who are about to die, find themselves confronted by change as their habitual meeting place (Der Waffle Haus) burns down the same day their boss and head reaper ([[Rube John Sofer|Rube]]) disappears (having \"gotten his lights\"). They soon meet their new boss, Cameron Kane ([[Henry Ian Cusick]]), a slick businessman who died falling from the [[World Trade Center (1973\u20132001)|World Trade Center]] on [[September 11 attacks|September 11, 2001]]. He outfits them with color-coordinated [[Palm Treo|smartphone]]s and treats them to luxurious accommodations \u2013 teaching them, as [[List of Dead Like Me characters#Roxy Harvey|Roxy]] ([[Jasmine Guy]]) puts it later, that \"nothing we do here matters.\" This tutelage leads the reapers to perform such misdeeds as saving those they were to reap (Roxy), abusing immortality for financial gain ([[List of Dead Like Me characters#Mason|Mason]], played by [[Callum Blue]]), letting a soul wander, instead of showing him \"his lights\" ([[List of Dead Like Me characters#Daisy Adair|Daisy]], now played by [[Sarah Wynter]]), and otherwise selfishly focusing on their wants.<ref name=\"film\">{{cite video | people = Herek, Stephen (Director) | title = Dead Like Me: Life After Death  | url = https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1079444/ | medium = DVD | publisher = Metro Goldwyn Mayer | location = Montr\u00e9al, Qu\u00e9bec, Canada |date = 2009 }}</ref>\n\n[[List of Dead Like Me characters#George Lass|Georgia \"George\" Lass]] ([[Ellen Muth]]), the movie's narrator, is fired from Happy Time (a [[temporary work|temp agency]]) after she loudly chews out an employee for delivering a report late.

George finds herself reminiscing with Reggie, helping Reggie prepare for the death of her boyfriend, Hudson Hart ([[Jordan Hudyma]]).<ref name=\"film\"/>\n\nGeorge's fellow reapers confront Kane and learn that he had realized and did not care that the \"pebbles\" of their misdeeds would cause \"waves\" of misfortune elsewhere. Unhappy with his style of management, they try to deduce how exactly a fellow reaper can be killed. They shoot and drown him to no effect before finally dismembering and cremating him. His ashes are then [[Space burial|shot into orbit]] along with those of [[List of Dead Like Me characters#Murray|Murray]], the cat belonging to George's boss [[List of Dead Like Me characters#Delores Herbig|Delores]].<ref name=\"film\"/> At the launch, Delores tells George that the employee who had sued her for harassment had done so at several of the employee's previous jobs, and George is reinstated, now with a corner office.\n\nThe reapers walk away from the launch, wondering who their new boss will be. George, after seeing her sister and mother drive off on vacation, finds herself suddenly showered with [[Post-it note|Post-Its]] falling from the sky, like the Post-Its their former leader Rube had used to deliver their reaping assignments. Realizing she has been selected as the group's new leader, she says, \"I am so fucked\" as the camera pulls away from the Earth into orbit.<ref name=\"film\"/>\n\n== Cast ==\n*[[Ellen Muth]] as [[Georgia Lass]]\n*[[Callum Blue]] as [[Mason (Dead Like Me)|Mason]]\n*[[Sarah Wynter]] as [[Daisy Adair]]\n*[[Jasmine Guy]] as [[Roxy Harvey]]\n*[[Britt McKillip]] as [[Reggie Lass]]\n*[[Shenae Grimes]] as Jennifer Hardick\n*[[Christine Willes]] as [[List of Dead Like Me characters#Delores Herbig|Delores Herbig]]\n*[[Cynthia Stevenson]] as [[List of Dead Like Me characters#Joy Lass|Joy Lass]]\n*[[Henry Ian Cusick]] as Cameron Kane\n* [[Jordan Hudyma]] as Hudson Hart\n\n== Casting ==\nIn June 2007, a casting call was posted on an entertainment industry website for the role of [[Daisy Adair]], formerly played by [[Laura Harris]], who was unable to reprise the role due to commitments with ''[[Women's Murder Club (TV series)|Women's Murder Club]]''. It noted that [[John Masius]] wrote the film and also confirmed that [[Mandy Patinkin]], who starred in the original series, was not in the film. In August 2007, it was confirmed that [[Sarah Wynter]] would take over the role of [[Daisy Adair]] from Laura Harris. Harris and Wynter previously played sisters in the second season of ''[[24 (TV series)|24]]''.
