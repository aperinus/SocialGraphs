See here: http://www.miramax.com/movie/kill-bill-volume-1/ --> Volume 1''''' is a 2003 American [[martial arts film]] written and directed by [[Quentin Tarantino]]. It stars [[Uma Thurman]] as [[The Bride (Kill Bill)|the Bride]], who swears revenge on a team of assassins ([[Lucy Liu]], [[Michael Madsen]], [[Daryl Hannah]], and [[Vivica A. Fox]]) and their leader, Bill ([[David Carradine]]), after they try to kill her. Her journey takes her to Tokyo, where she battles the [[yakuza]].\n\nTarantino conceived ''Kill Bill'' as a [[Homage (arts)|homage]] to [[grindhouse]] cinema, including martial arts films, [[samurai cinema]], [[blaxploitation]] and [[spaghetti Western]]s. It features an [[anime]] sequence by [[Production I.G]]. ''Volume 1'' is the first of two ''Kill Bill'' films made in a single production; they were planned as a single release, which Tarantino split into two films to avoid having to cut scenes. ''[[Kill Bill: Volume 2|Volume 2]]'' was released six months later.\n\n''Kill Bill'' was theatrically released in the United States on October 10, 2003. It received positive reviews and grossed over $180 million on a $30 million budget, achieving highest-grossing opening weekend of a Tarantino film up to that point. The film has since developed into a [[cult classic]] and has been appreciated as a [[feminist film]].<ref>{{Cite web |last=Pochapska |first=Victoria |date=2022-04-24 |title=Kill Bill: Movies That Quentin Tarantino Took From To Make His Hit |url=https://movieweb.com/kill-bill-movies-quentin-tarantino-took-from/ |access-date=2022-11-10 |website=MovieWeb |language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=The One, The Other: Female Liberation and Empowerment in Kill Bill and Simone de Beauvoir\u2019s The Second Sex {{!}} Department of English |url=https://english.umd.edu/research-innovation/journals/paper-shell-review/paper-shell-review-spring-2018/one-other-female |access-date=2022-11-10 |website=english.umd.edu}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Omana |first=Yazmin |title=How 'Kill Bill' finds its feminist message through violence |url=https://dailytargum.com//article/2022/09/how-kill-bill-finds-its-feminist-message-through-violence |access-date=2022-11-10 |website=The Daily Targum |language=en}}</ref>\n\n== Plot ==\nIn 1999, a pregnant woman in a wedding dress, [[The Bride (Kill Bill)|the Bride]], lies wounded in a chapel in [[El Paso, Texas]]. She tells her attacker, Bill, that the baby is his just as he shoots her in the head.\n\nFour years later, the Bride, having survived the attack, goes to the home of Vernita Green, planning to kill her. Both women were members of the Deadly Vipers, a group of assassins led by Bill, which has since disbanded; Vernita now leads a normal suburban family life. They engage in a [[knife fight]], which is interrupted when Vernita's young daughter Nikki arrives home from school. The Bride agrees to meet Vernita at night to settle the matter, but when Vernita tries to shoot the Bride with a pistol hidden in a box of cereal, the Bride throws a knife into Vernita's chest, killing her. Nikki witnesses the killing, and the Bride offers her a chance to avenge her mother's death when she grows up, should she choose to do so.\n\nFour years earlier, the cops investigate the massacre at the wedding chapel. The sheriff discovers that the Bride is alive but comatose. In the hospital, Deadly Viper Elle Driver prepares to assassinate the Bride via lethal injection, but Bill aborts the mission at the last moment, considering it dishonorable to kill the defenseless Bride. Awakening from her four-year coma, the Bride is horrified to find that she is no longer pregnant. She kills a man who intends to rape her while she is unconscious and a hospital worker who has raped her and has been selling her body while she was comatose. She takes the hospital worker's truck and teaches herself to walk again. Resolving to kill Bill and the other Deadly Vipers, the Bride picks her first target: O-Ren Ishii, now the leader of the Tokyo [[yakuza]].\n\nAfter witnessing the yakuza murder her parents when she was a child, O-Ren took vengeance on the yakuza boss and replaced him after training as an elite assassin. The Bride travels to Okinawa, Japan, to obtain a sword from legendary swordsmith [[Hattori Hanz\u014d]], who has sworn never to forge a sword again. After learning that her target is Bill, his former student, he relents and crafts his finest sword for her, taking a month to finish the job. The Bride tracks O-Ren to the House of Blue Leaves, a Tokyo restaurant, and amputates the arm of her assistant, Sofie Fatale. She defeats the Crazy 88, O-Ren's squad of elite fighters, and kills her bodyguard, schoolgirl Gogo Yubari. O-Ren and the Bride duel in the restaurant's [[Japanese garden]]; the Bride kills O-Ren by slicing off the top of her head. After torturing Sofie for information about Bill and the other Deadly Vipers, the Bride leaves her alive as a threat while going to kill Vernita. Bill finds Sofie and asks her if the Bride knows that her daughter is alive.\n\n== Cast ==\n\n* [[Uma Thurman]] as [[The Bride (Kill Bill)|the Bride]] (code name Black Mamba), a former member of the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad, described as \"the deadliest woman in the world\".

Tarantino told ''[[IGN]]'': \"I'm talking about scenes that are some of the best scenes in the movie, but in this hurdling pace where you're trying to tell only one story, that would have been the stuff that would have had to go. But to me, that's kind of what the movie was, are these little detours and these little grace notes.\"<ref name=\":1\" /> The decision to split the film was announced in July 2003.<ref name=\"Snyder\" />\n\n=== Car crash ===\nNear the end of filming, Thurman was injured in a crash while filming the scene in which she drives to Bill. According to Thurman, she was uncomfortable driving the car and asked a stunt driver to do it; Tarantino assured her that the car and road were safe. She lost control of the car and hit a tree, suffering a concussion and damage to her knees.<ref name=\"Dowd1\" />\n\nAccording to Thurman, Miramax would only give her the crash footage if she signed a document \"releasing them of any consequences of [Thurman's] future pain and suffering\". Tarantino was apologetic, but he and Thurman were acrimonious for years afterwards. Thurman said that after the accident she \"went from being a creative contributor and performer to being like a broken tool\". Miramax released the footage in 2018 after Thurman went to police following the [[Harvey Weinstein sexual abuse allegations|accusations of sexual abuse by Weinstein]].<ref name=\"Dowd1\">{{cite web|last1=Dowd|first1=Maureen|date=February 3, 2018|title=This Is Why Uma Thurman Is Angry|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/03/opinion/sunday/this-is-why-uma-thurman-is-angry.html|website=The New York Times|access-date=February 3, 2018|archive-date=May 24, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190524142010/https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/03/opinion/sunday/this-is-why-uma-thurman-is-angry.html|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://deadline.com/2018/02/quentin-tarantino-uma-thurman-harvey-weinstein-kill-bill-car-crash-new-york-times-1202278988/ |title=Quentin Tarantino Explains Everything: Uma Thurman, The 'Kill Bill' Crash & Harvey Weinstein |work=Deadline |last=Fleming |first=Mike Jr. |date=February 5, 2018 |access-date=August 17, 2021 |url-status=live |archive-date=January 28, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200128041859/https://deadline.com/2018/02/quentin-tarantino-uma-thurman-harvey-weinstein-kill-bill-car-crash-new-york-times-1202278988/ }}</ref>\n\n=== Music ===\n{{Main|Kill Bill Vol. 1 Original Soundtrack|l1=''Kill Bill Vol. 1 Original Soundtrack''}}\nAs with Tarantino's previous films, ''Kill Bill'' features a diverse soundtrack; genres include [[country music]] and [[Spaghetti Western]] scores by [[Ennio Morricone]].

A brief, 15-second excerpt from the opening of the ''[[Ironside (1967 TV series)|Ironside]]'' theme music by [[Quincy Jones]] is used as the Bride's revenge motif, which flares up with a red-tinged flashback whenever she is in the company of her next target.<ref>{{cite web |author=Other reviews by Rafael Ruiz |url=http://www.soundtrack.net/albums/database/?id=3356 |title=Kill Bill, Vol. 1 (2003) |publisher=Soundtrack |date=October 23, 2003 |access-date=May 29, 2012 |archive-date=March 3, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220303015140/https://www.soundtrack.net/album/kill-bill-vol-1/ |url-status=live }}</ref> Instrumental tracks from Japanese guitarist [[Tomoyasu Hotei]] figure prominently, and after the success of ''Kill Bill'' they were frequently used in American TV commercials and at sporting events. As the Bride enters \"The House of Blue Leaves\", go-go group the [[The 5.6.7.8's|5,6,7,8's]] perform \"I Walk Like Jayne Mansfield,\" \"[[I'm Blue (The Gong-Gong Song)]]\" and \"[[Woo-Hoo (Rock-A-Teens song)|Woo Hoo]]\".
