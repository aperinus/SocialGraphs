The plot of the films revolves around the title character who is a [[high tech]] thief and master of disguise, who becomes the anti-hero while using the moniker of various saints. He paradoxically lives in the underworld of international industrial theft and espionage. The film was a financial success with a worldwide box office of $169.4 million, rentals of $28.2 million, and continuous DVD sales.<ref name=\"imdb.com\">{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120053/business|title=The Saint|date=April 4, 1997|via=IMDb}}</ref><ref name=\"the-numbers1997\">{{cite web|url=https://www.the-numbers.com/movies/1997/SAINT.php |title=The Saint - Box Office Data, DVD Sales, Movie News, Cast Information |publisher=The Numbers |access-date=September 24, 2012}}</ref>\n\nIt is loosely based on the character of [[The Saint (Simon Templar)|Simon Templar]] created by [[Leslie Charteris]] in 1928 for a series of books published as \"The Saint\", which ran until 1983. The Saint character has also featured in a [[The Saint (film series)|series]] of [[Hollywood (film industry)|Hollywood]] films made between 1938 and 1954, a 1940s [[The Saint (radio program)|radio series]] starring [[Vincent Price]] (and others) as Templar, a popular [[United Kingdom|British]] [[The Saint (TV series)|television series]] of the 1960s starring [[Roger Moore]], and a 1970s series starring [[Ian Ogilvy]].\n\n==Plot==\nAt the [[Ignatius of Loyola|Saint Ignatius]] Orphanage, a rebellious boy named John Rossi refers to himself as \"Simon Templar\" and leads fellow orphans in an attempt to run away. He tries to bid farewell to a girl named Agnes with a kiss, but they are caught and she accidentally falls from a balcony to her death.\n\nAs an adult, Simon \u2014 now a professional thief dubbed \"The Saint\" for using [[Catholic saint]]s as aliases \u2014 steals a microchip from a Russian oil company. Simon stages the burglary during a political rally for the company's owner Ivan Tretiak, a billionaire oligarch and former [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist Party]] boss rallying support against [[President of the Russian Federation|Russian President]] Karpov. Simon is caught by Tretiak's son Ilya but escapes with the microchip, and is hired by Tretiak to steal a revolutionary [[cold fusion]] formula discovered by Emma Russell, an American [[Electrochemistry|electrochemist]] working at [[University of Oxford|Oxford]]; Tretiak plans to use Emma's formula for clean, inexpensive energy to monopolize the energy market during a severe oil shortage in Russia.\n\nUsing the alias \"[[Thomas More]]\", Simon poses as a [[Boer]] traveller to seduce Emma, and steals the formula after a [[one-night stand]]. Tretiak realizes the formula is incomplete and sends Ilya and his henchmen to kill Simon, who narrowly escapes. Simon returns to Russia to demand his payment from Tretiak while disguised as Tretiak himself. A heartbroken Emma reports the theft of her formula to Inspectors [[Claud Eustace Teal|Teal]] and Rabineau of [[Scotland Yard]], who inform her Simon is a wanted international thief.\n\nEmma tracks down Simon to a Moscow hotel where Tretiak has them arrested, but they escape and flee through the suburbs. They are sheltered by a prostitute and her family and meet Frankie, a [[Spiv]] who sells them directions through the sewers to the U.S. embassy. Finding Ilya and his men waiting for them, Simon lets himself be caught to allow Emma to safely reach the embassy, then escapes after igniting a car\u2019s gas tank and leaving Ilya severely burned.\n\nPlanting a listening device in Tretiak's office, Simon learns he plans to sell the incomplete formula to Karpov and frame him for wasting billions on useless technology, then use the political fallout to install himself as president. Emma finishes the formula, which Simon delivers to Tretiak's  well-meaning physicist Dr. Lev Botvin, who builds an apparatus that proves the formula works. Simon infiltrates the [[Kremlin]] and informs Karpov of Tretiak's conspiracy, but they are captured by Tretiak loyalists. At a massive gathering in [[Red Square]], Tretiak makes his accusations against Karpov, but Botvin\u2019s cold fusion reactor is successfully initiated, exposing Tretiak as a fraud. He and Ilya are arrested, and revealed to have caused the heating-oil shortage by stockpiling vast amounts of oil underneath their mansion.\n\nReuniting with Emma, Simon returns her formula and they start a secret relationship. She presents her formula to the world at a news conference, which Simon attends in disguise and escapes Teal and Rabineau when they spot him in the crowd. Driving away, he hears a news broadcast (voiced by [[Roger Moore]]) that $3 billion was donated to the [[Red Cross]], [[Salvation Army]], and the [[United Nations Children's Fund]]; it is implied that Simon, who had access to Tretiak's accounts, gave the money anonymously and established a non-profit foundation led by Dr. Botvin to develop the cold-fusion technology.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Val Kilmer]] as [[The Saint (Simon Templar)|Simon Templar]]\n* [[Elisabeth Shue]] as Dr. Emma Russell\n* [[Rade \u0160erbed\u017eija]] as Ivan Petrovich Tretiak\n* [[Valery Nikolaev]] as Ilya Tretiak\n* [[Henry Goodman]] as Dr. Lev Naumovich Botvin\n* [[Alun Armstrong]] as [[Claud Eustace Teal|Inspector Teal]]\n* [[Michael Byrne (actor)|Michael Byrne]] as Yuri Vereshagin\n* [[Yevgeni Lazarev]] as President Karpov\n* [[Irina Apeksimova]] as Aleksa \"Frankie\" Frankeyevich\n* [[Lev Prygunov]] as General Leo Sklarov\n* [[Charlotte Cornwell]] as Inspector Rabineau\n* [[Tommy Flanagan (actor)|Tommy Flanagan]] as Scarface\n* Egor Pazenko as Scratchface\n* Adam Smith as Young Simon Templar\n* Verity-Jane Dearsley as Agnes\n* [[Roger Moore]] as Radio Announcer Voice\n* [[David Schneider (actor)|David Schneider]] as Bar Waiter\n* [[William Hope (actor)|William Hope]] as State Department Official\n* [[Emily Mortimer]] as Woman on the plane\n\n==Production {{anchor|Production history}}==\nFilm adaptations of Leslie Charteris' anti-hero Simon Templar (The Saint) date back to the late 1930s when [[RKO Radio Pictures]] launched a popular series of [[B-movies]] with a succession of different actors playing the lead role. After that, save for two unsuccessful French attempts at launching new film series, the character was confined to television: ''[[The Saint (TV series)|The Saint]]'', a 1960s series starring [[Roger Moore]]; ''[[Return of the Saint]]'', a 1970s updating starring [[Ian Ogilvy]]; a failed 1987 pilot for American TV, ''The Saint in Manhattan'' starring [[Andrew Clarke (actor)|Andrew Clarke]]; and a set of feature-length made-for-television adventures co-produced in the [[United Kingdom]], [[Canada]], [[France]], [[Germany|West Germany]], [[Australia]] in 1989 starring [[Simon Dutton]]. Of these, the Moore series remained the definitive television adaptation.\n\nIn the mid-1980s, tabloid gossip newspapers such as the ''[[National Enquirer]]'' reported that Moore was planning to produce a new Saint movie, with [[Pierce Brosnan]] (then known for playing the Templar-influenced character [[Remington Steele]] on TV and later of [[James Bond]] fame) being considered for the role, though nothing came of this project.\n\nThe reference work ''The Saint: A Complete History'' by [[Burl Barer]] (McFarland 1992) was written at a time when another set of plans were under way to launch a new Saint film series, which would have been faithful to the original writings of Leslie Charteris and feature characters from the original books. This project also failed.\n\nA few years later, [[Paramount Pictures]]' attempt to make a film of ''The Saint'' started with the powerhouse [[Above the line (filmmaking)|above-the-line]] team of [[Robert Evans (film producer)|Robert Evans]] as producer, [[Steven Zaillian]] as writer and [[Sydney Pollack]] as director. [[Ralph Fiennes]] - hot from ''[[Schindler's List]]'' and ''[[Quiz Show (film)|Quiz Show]]'' - was offered $1 million for the lead, but eventually passed. In a 1994 interview for ''[[Premiere (magazine)|Premiere]]'' magazine, Fiennes said the [[screenplay]]\u2014racing fast cars, breaking into [[Swiss banks]] was nothing he hadn't seen before.\n\nRobert Evans left the project\u2014although, contractually, his name remains on the final film's credits\u2014and [[David Brown (producer)|David Brown]] (''[[Jaws (film)|Jaws]]'', ''[[Driving Miss Daisy]]'') took over. A new story was commissioned from [[Jonathan Hensleigh]] (''[[Die Hard with a Vengeance]]''), which cast Simon Templar as a mercenary hired by a billionaire Russian oil and gas tycoon to steal the secret of cold fusion from an eccentric but beautiful American scientist. The story would take place in [[Washington, D.C.]], [[The Hamptons|Upstate New York]], [[Saint Petersburg|St. Petersburg]], and [[Moscow]]. [[Setpiece]]s included Dr. Russell skydiving while strapped into a wheelchair and a plane landing in [[Red Square]]. Darwin Mayflower described it as one of the top unproduced screenplays.<ref>{{cite web\n |date        = August 8, 2000\n |author      = Darwin Mayflower\n |title       = Script Reviews: TOP TEN UNPRODUCED SCRIPTS\n |url         = http://www.screenwritersutopia.com/modules.php?name=Content&pa=showpage&pid=2667\n |url-status     = dead\n |archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20060324230756/http://www.screenwritersutopia.com/modules.php?name=Content&pa=showpage&pid=2667\n |archive-date = March 24, 2006\n}}\n</ref> [[Phillip Noyce]] was hired to direct.\n\nProviding a link to both the 1960s ''[[The Saint (TV series)|The Saint]]'' TV series and the later ''[[Return of the Saint]]'' revival of the 1970s, [[Robert S. Baker]], the producer of both series, was brought in an executive producer of the film.\n\nIn a 1997 interview with [[Des O'Connor]] for his [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] show, [[Hugh Grant]] says he passed on the role after a meeting with Noyce because he didn't like the director's approach to the character. [[Hugh Grant]], [[Kenneth Branagh]], [[Mel Gibson]], [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]], [[Christian Slater]], [[George Clooney]], [[Kevin Costner]], [[Johnny Depp]] and [[Daniel Day-Lewis]] all refused the role. [[Val Kilmer]] was cast after declining to reprise the role of [[Batman]]/[[Bruce Wayne]] in [[Joel Schumacher]]'s ''[[Batman & Robin (film)|Batman & Robin]]'' and the script was rewritten by [[Wesley Strick]] to suit his style.\n\nStrick's rewrite relocated the action to [[London]] and [[Oxford]] and merged two villains together by having Tretiak running for president himself rather than endorsing a puppet candidate. Kilmer was constantly pressing for more disguises in the film, although Paramount wanted to keep that idea for their ''[[Mission: Impossible (1966 TV series)|Mission: Impossible]]'' franchise. The Saint, as devised by Charteris in the 1930s, used crude disguises instead of the sophisticated ones shown in this film.\n\nUnusually for an action star of the time (as in heroes played by [[Steven Seagal]], [[Bruce Willis]] or [[Mel Gibson]]), this Saint refrained from killing and even the main villains live to stand trial. Charteris' version had no qualms about taking another life.\n\nIn the original version of the film\u2014as in the original Jonathan Hensleigh script\u2014Emma, having escaped Russia via the American embassy, collapses while giving a lecture and dies in Simon Templar's arms. Watching the videotape back, he sees Ilya Tretiak stabbing her in the leg with the tip of his cane. The final half-hour has Simon returning to Moscow to destroy the villains' plans and avenge her death. With Dr. Botvin's help, he switches the formulas around and humiliates Ivan Tretiak during his show trial of the Russian president. The Tretiaks shoot their way out of the crowd and escape back to their mansion, with Simon and the [[Russian Armed Forces|Russian Army]] in pursuit. Ivan shoots the treacherous Dr. Botvin, and in turn Ilya shoots and kills Ivan. Simon arrives and finds the bodies of Botvin and Ivan Tretiak. Simon battles Ilya on the stairwell as Russian tanks pound the mansion walls, exposing and setting fire to the vast stockpile of heating oil in the basement. With the stairwell disintegrating around them, the fight spills out on to the chandelier, suspended above the blazing oil. Simon teases Ilya with the disc containing the formula for cold fusion. As he reaches out for it, Simon cuts the rope and Ilya plummets to a fiery death. Returning to Emma's home, Simon finds a letter from her, a tear fills his eye and he vows to use his skills only for good.<ref>{{cite AV media|people=Hensleigh, Jonathan (screenwriter)|date=February 8, 1995|title=The Saint (original script)|medium=Motion picture|location=Los Angeles, California|publisher=[[Paramount Pictures]]}}</ref>\n\nThe [[novelization]] features an alternate version in which Emma lives and Simon and Ilya still battle on the chandelier. In the end the producers decided to cut Emma's death scene and Templar's battle with Ilya, inserted footage of the Tretiaks being arrested and filmed a new epilogue at Oxford. (Footage from the original ending features prominently in the film's trailer.)\n\nThe film featured the [[Volvo C70]], a nod to the [[Volvo P1800]] of the original series.\n\n[[Fort Amherst]] starred as a filming location for ''The Saint'' in 1997. The tunnels were used for the scene in which Simon receives a map in the Kremlin tunnel in Moscow.<ref>{{cite web|author=Kent Film Office|url=http://kentfilmoffice.co.uk/1997/10/the-saint-1997/|title=Kent Film Office The Saint Film Focus}}</ref>\n\n==Novelization==\n{{Main|The Saint (novel)}}\n\nA novelization based upon the film script was written by [[Burl Barer]].<ref>{{cite book | title = The Saint (novelization) | author = [[Burl Barer]] | publisher = [[Pocket Books]] | date = 1997 | type = [[Paperback]] | isbn = 0-671-00951-6 | oclc= 36527456 }}</ref>\n\n==Soundtrack==\n{{Main|The Saint (soundtrack)}}\n\n''The Saint'' won the 1998 BMI Film Music Award.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/event/ev0000106/1998|title=BMI Film & TV Awards (1998)|website=[[IMDb]]}}</ref>\n\nThe songs \"[[Out of My Mind (Duran Duran song)|Out of My Mind]]\" by [[Duran Duran]] and \"[[6 Underground (song)|6 Underground]]\" by the [[Sneaker Pimps]] were played during the credits, and released as [[single (music)|single]]s to promote the movie.\n\nThe film's soundtrack album, ''[[The Saint (soundtrack)|The Saint: Music from the Motion Picture Soundtrack]]'' included many songs from the [[electronica]] age.
