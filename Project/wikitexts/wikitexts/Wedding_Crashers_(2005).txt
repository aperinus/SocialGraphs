At the end of a season of successful crashes, Jeremy takes John to the wedding of the eldest daughter of the [[U.S. Secretary of the Treasury]], William Cleary. Once inside, the pair set their sights on Cleary's other daughters, Gloria and Claire. During the reception, Jeremy has sex with Gloria on a nearby beach who afterwards tells him that she was a [[Virginity|virgin]]. Gloria is possessive and quickly becomes obsessed with Jeremy, and Jeremy urges John to escape the reception with him. Meanwhile, John attempts to court Claire, the [[maid of honor]], but is interrupted by her hotheaded boyfriend, Sack Lodge, who is unfaithful and disrespectful behind her back. When Gloria invites Jeremy and John to an extended weekend retreat at their family compound in [[Maryland]], John overrules Jeremy and accepts in an effort to get closer to Claire.\n\nJohn and Jeremy become acquainted with the Clearys: the Secretary's wife Kathleen harasses John; Gloria's brother, Todd, tries to seduce Jeremy during the night. Gloria continues to lavish unwanted sexual attention on Jeremy, [[Handjob|massaging his penis]] at a family dinner and attacks him after tying his wrists and ankles to a bedframe; and Sack repeatedly injures Jeremy during a game of [[Touch football (American)|touch football]]. At dinner, John spikes Sack's wine with eye-drops to make him sick and get more time to connect with Claire.\n\nJohn and Claire continue to bond the next day on a sailing trip. The suspicious Sack takes John and Jeremy on a hunting trip and pranks them, resulting in Jeremy getting shot in the buttocks. While Jeremy recovers, John and Claire go on a bike ride to a secluded beach. Claire finally admits she is not sure how she feels about Sack and ends up kissing John passionately. Meanwhile, Gloria tends to Jeremy's wounds and reveals to him that she is not a virgin as she initially told him. Jeremy realizes that he himself has been played and that he may be in love with Gloria.\n\nWhile John is confessing his attraction to Claire, they are interrupted by Jeremy being chased out of the house. Sack, who had been investigating them, reveals John and Jeremy's real identities to the family. Betrayed, Claire turns on John, and the Secretary tells them to leave.\n\nOver the following months, John attempts to reach Claire, but she refuses to see him. Expecting Jeremy to aid him, he attempts to sneak into her and Sack's engagement party but is caught and beaten by Sack. Confronting Jeremy about abandoning him, he learns that Jeremy has secretly continued his relationship with Gloria. Betrayed and brokenhearted, John spirals into depression, crashes weddings alone and becomes [[Nihilism|nihilistic]] and suicidal. Meanwhile, as Claire and Sack plan their wedding, Claire's doubts about her future with Sack grow. Jeremy proposes to Gloria and tries to ask John to be his [[best man]], but John turns him away.\n\nJohn visits Jeremy's former wedding crashing mentor, Chazz Reinhold, who convinces a reluctant John to crash a funeral with him. At the funeral, John reconsiders his belief in love and marriage after seeing the grieving widow. He rushes to Jeremy's wedding and joins the wedding mid-ceremony, to Jeremy's delight. Claire is upset by his appearance, prompting John to express regret for his past behavior and profess his love for her in front of the congregation. Sack interrupts, but Claire finally tells him that she cannot marry him. Sack tries to attack John, but Jeremy intervenes and knocks him out, and John and Claire kiss. After the wedding, the two couples drive away from the ceremony and discuss crashing another wedding together.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Owen Wilson]] as John Beckwith\n* [[Vince Vaughn]] as Jeremy Grey\n* [[Christopher Walken]] as [[United States Secretary of the Treasury|U.S. Secretary]] William Cleary\n* [[Rachel McAdams]] as Claire Cleary, William & Kathleen's daughter and John's love interest\n* [[Isla Fisher]] as Gloria Cleary, William & Kathleen's daughter and Jeremy's love interest\n* [[Jane Seymour (actress)|Jane Seymour]] as Kathleen Cleary, William's wife\n* [[Ellen Albertini Dow]] as \"Grandma\" Mary Cleary, William's mother\n* [[Keir O'Donnell]] as Todd Cleary, William & Kathleen's son\n* [[Bradley Cooper]] as Sack Lodge, Claire's boyfriend\n* [[Henry Gibson]] as Father O'Neil\n* [[Ron Canada]] as Randolph\n* [[Rebecca de Mornay]] as Mrs. Kroeger\n* [[Dwight Yoakam]] as Mr. Kroeger\n* Jenny Alden as Christina Cleary, William & Kathleen's daughter\n* [[Will Ferrell]] as Chazz Reinhold (uncredited)<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.hollywood.com/general/will-ferrell-i-regret-saying-no-to-leading-role-in-the-wedding-crashers-60583416 | title=Will Ferrell: 'I regret saying no to leading role in the Wedding Crashers' | date=May 18, 2016 }}</ref>\n\nArizona Senator and 2008 Republican presidential nominee [[John McCain]] and Democratic strategist and [[CNN]] contributor [[James Carville]] both make a brief [[cameo appearance]], they are shown congratulating the secretary and his wife on their daughter's wedding.<ref name=\"heart\">{{cite magazine |date= July 25, 2005 |first= Amy |last= Ryan |title= 'Wedding Crashers' inspires 'Heart'-felt outrage |url= https://ew.com/article/2005/07/25/wedding_crasher/ |magazine= [[Entertainment Weekly]] |quote= In Washington, I work with boobs every day. }}</ref> McCain was criticized for his appearance in the film,<ref name=\"drudge\" /> having previously called out Hollywood for marketing R-Rated films to teenagers.<ref>{{cite web |date= 30 July 2005 |last= Sherwell |first= Philip |title= McCain attacked for cameo role in Wedding Crashers |url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/1495210/McCain-attacked-for-cameo-role-in-Wedding-Crashers.html |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20220112/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/1495210/McCain-attacked-for-cameo-role-in-Wedding-Crashers.html |archive-date=January 12, 2022 |url-access=subscription |url-status=live |website= [[The Daily Telegraph|Telegraph]] }}{{cbignore}}</ref>\n\n== Production ==\nAndrew Panay, co-producer of ''Wedding Crashers'', had the idea for the film based on his own experiences of being excited to attend weddings in his 20s due to the prospect of meeting women.<ref name=\"history\">{{cite web |last= Grierson |first= Tim |title=The Oral History of ''Wedding Crashers'' |url= https://melmagazine.com/en-us/story/the-oral-history-of-wedding-crashers |website=MEL Magazine |date= June 23, 2017 |access-date=December 30, 2018}}</ref> Panay then consulted the screenwriting team of [[Steve Faber]] and [[Bob Fisher (screenwriter)|Bob Fisher]] to come up with a story based on this premise. Much of the film was based upon Fisher's experiences as an college intern in Washington DC, where he would make up fake backstories to crash [[lobbying|lobbyist]] events. Panay and Fisher's experiences merged together to form the idea of a film in which the main characters crash weddings in order to meet and sleep with women. The screenwriters had doubts that the premise could be sustained into a feature-length film, so they decided to add female love interests born from a political family, inspired by their dream of marrying a girl from the [[Kennedy family]] when they were young boys.<ref name=\"history\" /> It was also Panay's desire \"to explore male friendship through this crazy idea of crashing weddings\" as the emotional core of the movie.<ref name=\"history\" /> In preparation for the film, the creators would crash [[Political party|political party]] platform committee meetings in order to delve into the psyche of the characters and what it means to crash a party.\n\nOn April 6, 2003, ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' reported that both Faber and Fisher had struck a \"mid-six figures\" deal with [[New Line Cinema]] to acquire the [[Pitch (filmmaking)|pitch]] for the film.<ref name=\"var1\">{{cite web |last1=Dunkley |first1=Cathy |last2=Harris |first2=Dana |title=New Line woos scribes |url=https://variety.com/2003/film/features/new-line-woos-scribes-1117884206/ |website=Variety |date=April 6, 2003 |access-date=November 2, 2020}}</ref> [[David Dobkin (director)|David Dobkin]] signed to direct in 2004, seeing it as an opportunity to pair [[Vince Vaughn]] and [[Owen Wilson]], who had previously worked with the director and gave him an [[Abbott and Costello]] impression when they were at the premiere of his film ''[[Shanghai Knights]]''.<ref name=\"var2\">{{cite web |last1=Nichols |first1=Mackenzie |title='Wedding Crashers' at 15: The Secrets Behind the Hit Comedy Starring Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson |url=https://variety.com/2020/film/news/wedding-crashers-jane-seymour-david-dobkin-15th-anniversary-1234633245/ |website=Variety |date=July 10, 2020 |access-date=November 2, 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"var3\">{{cite web |last1=Brodesser |first1=Claude |title='Crashers' helmer set |url=https://variety.com/2004/film/markets-festivals/crashers-helmer-set-1117900067/ |website=Variety |date= February 21, 2004 |access-date=November 2, 2020}}</ref> According to Dobkin, the marketing department at New Line raised some concerns regarding the protagonists of the film, who were seen as misogynists whose goal is to seduce women at weddings and have [[Casual sex|sex]] with them.<ref name=\"var2\"/> The director saw these characters in a different light, however, convincing the department:\n\n<blockquote>They love weddings, authentically. They like the free food, they like the music and the bands, they like the dancing and the kids, they like talking to the grandparents. These guys make the weddings better. You would want them to crash your wedding</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>That's the distinction. It's not misogynistic and, in fact, what it's doing is replicating a real seduction, which is, \"I want to go to bed with you, but I have all these walls up. Can you make me laugh, make me attracted to you and find a way to make this really fun so we could get to the good part?\" That's a seduction. So, if I can seduce the audience\u200a\u2014\u200aif I can make them laugh and be entertained and think these are okay guys\u200a\u2014\u200aby the time they're dropping the girls in the bed, it's a magic trick.

Dobkin cast [[Bradley Cooper]] without watching even watching his audition tape as he was so impressed by the actor's test reading.<ref name=\"history\" /> [[Isla Fisher|Isla Fischer]], then a relatively unknown actress was cast as Gloria over [[Shannon Elizabeth]] and [[Anna Paquin]]. The casting of Secretary Cleary was a contentious issue between Dobkin and the studio executives, with Dobkin wanting to cast [[Christopher Walken]] but New Line Cinema wanting a more comedic actor such as [[Burt Reynolds]] instead of Walken who was viewed as a serious character actor.<ref name=\"history\" /> The role of Claire was the final role to be cast, with Dobkin auditioning over 200 actresses before casting [[Rachel McAdams]].<ref name=\"history\" />\n\nDirector David Dobkin originally considered the possibility of releasing a version of the film that was not [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system|R-rated]] in order to broaden the movies commercial appeal, but the idea was abandoned after a consultant provided a long list of the many R-Rated elements in the film, and Dobkin realized \"The two funniest scenes in the movie would have had to go.\"<ref name=\"drudge\">{{cite web |date= July 13, 2005 |first= Matt|last= Drudge|author-link= Matt Drudge |title= SEN.
