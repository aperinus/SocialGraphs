The film is directed by [[David Leitch (director)|David Leitch]], in his [[List of directorial debuts|first solo directorial credit]], and it is written by [[Kurt Johnstad]].

Ten days later, Lorraine Broughton, a top-level MI6 spy, is brought in to be debriefed by MI6 executive Eric Gray and [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] agent Emmett Kurzfeld about her just-finished mission to Berlin. The plot jumps between the debriefing room and [[flashback (narrative)|flashbacks]] to Lorraine's time in Berlin.\n\nThe day after Gascoigne's death, Lorraine is dispatched to recover The List and is told to keep an eye out for Satchel, a double agent for the KGB who has been a problem for MI6 for years. Arriving in Berlin, she is immediately ambushed by KGB agents speaking English and apparently posing as her own MI6 team, who attempt to deliver a message from their boss, Aleksander Bremovych. She is able to escape their grasp by crashing their car and is immediately picked up by her real MI6 contact, maverick MI6 station head David Percival, who should have been the one to pick her up initially. Percival is addicted to the Bohemian lifestyle he has been leading on both sides of the Berlin wall and resentful of Lorraine and the implied supervision from London she brings, and he seems unwilling to cooperate with her. Lorraine searches Gascoigne's apartment and discovers a picture of him and Percival. In the debriefing, she tells Gray and Kurzfeld Percival had previously denied knowing Gascoigne and she suspects Percival was behind the [[Berlin Police|West Berlin police]] ambushing her while she searched Gascoigne's apartment. When Lorraine visits a restaurant mentioned by the KGB agents she encounters Bremovych, but is \"saved\" by Delphine Lasalle, a novice French agent. Although Lorraine is initially suspicious of Lasalle, they eventually enter into a sexual relationship after a passionate kiss in a nightclub, where Lasalle tells Lorraine that she knows who she is and why she's in Berlin, and suggests that they should work together.\n\nPercival, having tailed Lorraine, surveils a watchmaker she visited. He spots Bakhtin entering the same shop. Bakhtin tells the watchmaker he has a watch full of secrets he will sell to the highest bidder. Kurzfeld meets with Lorraine in Berlin, handing her a newspaper containing a number which, when called, informs her Satchel has been compromised. Percival lures Bakhtin to an alley, kills him, and takes the wristwatch  from which he discovers who Satchel is. Lorraine, who does not know Percival has The List, finds out that the [[Stasi]] officer codenamed Spyglass, who gave The List to Gascoigne, also memorized the names on it. Lorraine and Percival make plans to escort him across the border to West Berlin. Percival meets with Bremovych, who suspects Percival has The List, but Percival offers only the second best thing\u2014the identity and operations details of Satchel \"to keep the balance\", also tipping him off about the plan to extricate Spyglass from East Berlin. Lasalle covertly photographs the meeting.\n\nDuring the extrication of Spyglass, Percival secretly shoots him when the KGB agents are unable to. Lorraine battles multiple KGB agents while rescuing the wounded Spyglass, however, he drowns when their car is pushed into a river by the same KGB agent whose car Lorraine crashed when she first arrived in Berlin. Lorraine makes it to West Berlin and realizes Percival has planted a bug in her coat. She tells Lasalle, who calls Percival and threatens him with her knowledge of his Bremovych meeting. Percival goes to Lasalle's apartment and kills her, fleeing as Lorraine arrives moments later. Lorraine discovers the photographs taken by Lasalle and realizes Percival has read The List. Percival burns his safehouse and attempts to flee, but Lorraine arrives, kills him, avenging Lasalle, and takes The List.\n\nIn the MI6 debriefing, Lorraine discovers Percival had told Gray he had The List and he was \"very close to Satchel\". She presents Lasalle's photographs and doctored audio recordings, which paint Percival as Satchel. She denies knowing The List's whereabouts, leaving MI6 no choice but to close the case.\n\nThree days later in [[Paris]], Lorraine, now speaking in [[Russian language|Russian]], meets with Bremovych, who addresses her as \"Comrade Satchel\". Bremovych, having learned from Percival there is more to Satchel than he had previously known, orders his men to kill her. Lorraine kills his henchmen. Then, speaking with an American accent, she tells Bremovych she always fed him misinformation to manipulate the KGB. Then she kills him. She and Kurzfeld (CIA) return to the [[United States]] with The List. In their friendly conversation, it is implied Lorraine is actually a triple agent and had been working for the CIA all along.\n\n== Cast ==\n<!--- Cast per tombstone opening credits order w/\u201cAnd Toby Jones\u201d up with Goodman, roles per closing credits scroll --->\n* [[Charlize Theron]] as Lorraine Broughton, a top-level [[Secret Intelligence Service|MI6]] field agent.\n* [[James McAvoy]] as David Percival, a maverick MI6 Berlin station chief who is assigned to assist Lorraine in her mission.\n* [[John Goodman]] as Emmett Kurzfeld, a senior [[CIA]] agent working with MI6.\n* [[Til Schweiger]] as The Watchmaker, a mysterious neutral character who crafts special watches hiding codes inside.\n* [[Eddie Marsan]] as \"Spyglass\", the [[Stasi]] defector who gives the list to Gascoigne.\n* [[Sofia Boutella]] as Delphine Lasalle, an undercover French agent. \n* [[Roland M\u00f8ller]] as Aleksander Bremovych, a high-ranking Russian [[KGB]] operative in Berlin.\n* [[J\u00f3hannes Haukur J\u00f3hannesson|J\u00f3hannes J\u00f3hannesson]] as Yuri Bakhtin, the rogue KGB agent who kills Gascoigne and steals the list.\n* [[James Faulkner (actor)|James Faulkner]] as [[Chief of the Secret Intelligence Service|\"C\"]], head of MI6.\n* [[Barbara Sukowa]] as the [[coroner]], who is in charge of releasing Gascoigne's body to Lorraine.\n* [[Toby Jones]] as Eric Gray, Lorraine's MI6 superior.\n\nIn addition, [[Sam Hargrave]] and [[Bill Skarsg\u00e5rd]] make brief appearances as MI6 agent James Gascoigne and as Lorraine's East German contact and presumed CIA ally Merkel, respectively.
