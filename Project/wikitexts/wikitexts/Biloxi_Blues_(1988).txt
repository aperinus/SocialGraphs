Jerome sets three goals\u2014lose his virginity, survive the war, and become a writer. He is sent to basic training at [[Keesler Field]] near [[Biloxi, Mississippi]].<ref>{{cite news |last=Pettus |first=Gary |date=April 1, 1988 |title=Simon strikes winning chord with rendition of 'Biloxi Blues' |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/108681020/blues/ |work=[[The Clarion-Ledger]] |location=Jackson, MS |page=D-1 |via=[[Newspapers.com]]}}</ref> Jerome keeps a journal to record his impressions of his fellow draftees. The new privates are trained by Sergeant Toomey, a wounded veteran with a steel plate in his head. Toomey imposes arbitrary rules and metes out harsh punishments.\n\nEpstein refuses to accept Toomey's authority. Toomey imposes increasingly harsh punishments in an effort to break him, but Epstein refuses to compromise. While the other privates try to avoid Toomey's ire, they admire Epstein's determination. Toomey also eventually comes to respect Epstein's refusal to submit. One evening, Jerome proposes that each man share his fantasy of how he would spend his final days if he had only a week to live. They each pay five dollars, and Jerome agrees to judge the stories and pick a winner. Jerome chooses Epstein's fantasy of making Toomey do 200 push-ups. The men argue about Jerome's selection and Wykowski makes Anti-Semitic remarks, which leads to a confrontation between him and Epstein. Toomey ends it, but Jerome feels badly for not defending Epstein.\n\nWhen the soldiers are about to go on a two-day leave, Wykowski reports that his money has been stolen. Toomey demands that the thief step forward and Epstein places money on Wykowski's footlocker. Toomey then reveals that he took Wykowski's money to teach Wykowski a lesson about securing his valuables. Epstein is confined to the barracks for having falsely confessed and tells Jerome that he did it because he was sure to be punished anyway, since Toomey wants to break him. Jerome accomplishes one goal when he has sex with Rowena, a prostitute. The platoon arrives back at the barracks before Jerome, where they discover his journal, take turns reading it aloud, and learn Jerome's private thoughts about them. When Jerome arrives, he realizes the journal is missing and Wykowski resumes reading from it. Epstein discovers that Jerome believes Epstein is gay.\n\nToomey enters the barracks in the middle of the night and reports that two soldiers were caught having sex in the latrine, but one escaped. Toomey wants the guilty party to step forward. When no one does, he suspends everyone's privileges and weekend leave. The soldiers believe the man who got away was Epstein, giving Jerome a lesson in the power of the written word. The next morning, Toomey reports that the man who escaped was Hennesey, whom everyone likes, but no one suspected was gay. The platoon later learns that Hennesey was sentenced to three months confinement, followed by a dishonorable discharge.\n\nJerome meets Daisy Hannigan, a beautiful, smart Catholic girl from [[Gulfport, Mississippi|Gulfport]]. He leaves camp whenever he can so they can see each other, and he confesses his love right before leaving Camp Shelby for his first duty assignment. Jerome admits to the audience that the chances of seeing Daisy again after the war are slim, but that knowing he has a girl waiting back home motivates him to survive the war.\n\nNear the end of the platoon's training, Toomey gets drunk because he has an upcoming appointment at a veterans hospital and believes he will be discharged for disability. Preferring prison to being discharged, he calls for Epstein, whom he holds at gunpoint in a final effort to compel him to follow orders by making Epstein turn him in for his misdeeds. Epstein calls in the rest of the platoon to serve as witnesses. Toomey is aware of the story contest Epstein won and accepts Epstein's offer not to press charges in exchange for Toomey completing 200 push-ups.\n\nAs his fellow privates sleep on a train while ''en route'' to their next duty stations, Jerome informs the audience of the destiny of each. He concludes by telling the audience that he accomplished his second goal of surviving the war and his third goal of becoming an author, although his path to success was different than what he expected.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Matthew Broderick]] as Private Eugene Morris Jerome\n* [[Christopher Walken]] as Technical Sergeant Merwin J.
