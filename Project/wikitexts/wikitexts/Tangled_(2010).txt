The film was directed by [[Nathan Greno]] and [[Byron Howard]] (in the former\u2019s [[directorial debut|feature directorial debut]]), and produced by [[Roy Conli]], with a screenplay written by [[Dan Fogelman]].

She accepts the aid of an intruder to take her out into the world which she has never seen.\n\nBefore the film's release, its title was changed from ''Rapunzel'' to ''Tangled'', reportedly to market the film gender-neutrally.<ref name=\"LATimes\" /> ''Tangled'' spent six years in production at a cost that has been estimated at $260 million, which, if accurate, would make it the [[List of most expensive animated films|most expensive animated film ever made]] and [[List of most expensive films|one of the most expensive films]] of all time. The film employed a unique artistic style by blending together features of [[computer-generated imagery]] (CGI) and [[traditional animation]] while using [[non-photorealistic rendering]] to create the impression of a painting. Composer [[Alan Menken]], who had worked on prior Disney animated features, returned to score ''Tangled'', and also wrote the film\u2019s songs with [[Glenn Slater]].\n\n''Tangled'' premiered at the [[El Capitan Theatre]] in Los Angeles on November 14, 2010, and went into general release on November 24. The film earned $592 million in worldwide box office revenue,<ref name=mojo /> $200 million of which was earned in the United States and Canada, [[2010 in film|making it the eighth highest-grossing film of 2010]], and was praised by critics for its animation, writing, characters, and musical score. The film was nominated for a number of awards, including [[Academy Award for Best Original Song|Best Original Song]] at the [[83rd Academy Awards]]. The film was released on [[Blu-ray]] and DVD on March 29, 2011; a short film, ''[[Tangled Ever After]]'', was released later in 2012 and a [[Rapunzel's Tangled Adventure|television series]] premiered in 2017.\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be 400-700 words in length. This article is currently at 741. -->\nLong ago, a drop of magical sunlight falls from the sky and sprouts a flower with healing powers. Upon discovering it, an old beggar woman named [[Mother Gothel]] hides the flower and uses it to stay young for centuries, until royal soldiers from the nearby kingdom of Corona find and uproot it to save their pregnant and ill Queen. The Queen gives birth to a baby princess with long golden hair. While the king and queen are sleeping one evening, Gothel discovers the hair has the same powers as the flower, but turns brown and becomes powerless when cut. She kidnaps the girl, named [[Rapunzel (Tangled)|Rapunzel]], and raises her in a hidden tower in the woods, using her hair to stay young.\n\nEach year, on Rapunzel's birthday, the king and queen release thousands of [[sky lanterns]] in hope she will see them and return home. Rapunzel becomes obsessed with the distant lights, and, on the eve of her 18th birthday, asks Gothel for permission to see them closer. Gothel refuses, claiming that the outside world is dangerous and Rapunzel is too weak and young to survive in it. Later, handsome thief [[Flynn Rider]] steals Rapunzel's intended crown from the palace, abandons his partners, the Stabbington brothers, and takes refuge in the tower. Rapunzel knocks him out with a frying pan, and hides him in a closet. She tries to show him to Gothel as proof she is capable of taking care of herself; however, Gothel still refuses to listen, so Rapunzel sends Gothel on a three-day journey to get new paints as a birthday gift.\n\nRapunzel hides the crown and tells Flynn he can only get it back by taking her to see the lights. Along the way, they stop at the Snuggly Duckling pub, where menacing thugs try to capture the wanted Flynn. Rapunzel soon charms them into revealing their softer sides; when royal guards arrive, the thugs help her and Flynn to escape. Meanwhile, Gothel becomes suspicious, returns to the empty tower, and finds the crown. She sets out to find Rapunzel, and allies herself with the Stabbington brothers.\n\nIn escaping from the guards, Flynn and Rapunzel become trapped in a fast-flooding cave. Thinking they will die, Flynn resignedly reveals his true name (Eugene Fitzherbert) and Rapunzel reveals her magic powers. Her glowing hair shows a previously hidden exit, and they escape and take refuge in the woods. That night, Gothel catches up to Rapunzel while Eugene is away, gives her the crown, and tells her to use it to test Eugene's loyalty.\n\nThe next morning, a palace horse named Maximus tracks down Eugene. Rapunzel demands a truce in honor of her birthday, and Maximus reluctantly agrees, joining them as they enter the kingdom and attend a festival in honor of the \"lost princess\". They spend the day celebrating with the townsfolk, then sail onto the lake to watch the release of the lanterns. Having fulfilled her dream, Rapunzel gives Eugene back the crown. The two confess their love, when Eugene sees the Stabbington brothers on the shore. He walks off to apologize, and offers them the crown, but they assault him, tying him to a ship so the royal guards will arrest him and Rapunzel will think he abandoned her. They then try to capture Rapunzel, but Gothel stages a \"rescue\" by knocking the brothers unconscious, and takes Rapunzel home.\n\nEugene escapes with the help of Maximus and the pub thugs. Meanwhile, Rapunzel realizes she has subconsciously incorporated the kingdom's [[royal standard|standard]] into her artwork all her life; finally understanding that she is the \"lost princess\", she confronts Gothel. Eugene arrives at the tower, and her hair is thrown down to him. Upon climbing up, however, he finds she has been bound and gagged, and Gothel fatally stabs him from behind. She tries to drag Rapunzel to a new hiding place. Rapunzel offers to go willingly, if Gothel will allow her to heal Eugene. Gothel reluctantly agrees, but Eugene, realizing Rapunzel would be spending the rest of her life in Gothel's captivity, cuts off her hair before she can heal him. Gothel begins to age rapidly and turns to dust as she falls out of the tower.\n\nRapunzel mourns the loss of Eugene, and one of her tears, still having some of the sun's power, saves his life. Eugene reunites Rapunzel with her real parents, is fully pardoned for his crimes, and he and Rapunzel are married as the kingdom celebrates.\n\n==Voice cast==\n{{main|List of Disney's Tangled characters}}\n\n* [[Mandy Moore]] \u2013 [[Rapunzel (Tangled)|Rapunzel]]<ref name=\"slashsep10\">{{cite news|last1=Connelly|first1=Brendon|title=Disney Pixar Add Cast to Rapunzel, Bear & the Bow and Toy Story 3, Reveal Plot of Cars 2 and Winnie the Pooh|url=https://www.slashfilm.com/disney-pixar-add-cast-to-rapunzel-bear-the-bow-and-toy-story-3-reveal-plot-of-cars-2-and-winnie-the-pooh/|access-date=July 7, 2014|work=[[SlashFilm]]|publisher=/Film|date=September 10, 2009}}</ref><ref name=\"fletchersep10\">{{cite news|last1=Fletcher|first1=Alex|title=Mandy Moore to voice 'Rapunzel' musical|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/movies/news/a176737/mandy-moore-to-voice-rapunzel-musical.html#~oJkxTzsfu8l7ZI|access-date=July 7, 2014|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hearst Magazines|Hearst Magazines UK]]|date=September 10, 2009}}</ref>\n** Delaney Rose Stein \u2013 young Rapunzel<ref name=yahooprofile />\n* [[Zachary Levi]] \u2013 [[Eugene Fitzherbert (Tangled)|Flynn Rider/Eugene Fitzherbert]]<ref name=slashsep10 /><ref name=fletchersep10 />\n* [[Donna Murphy]] \u2013 [[Mother Gothel]]<ref>{{cite news|last1=Franklin|first1=Garth|title=Donna Murphy Joins \"Rapunzel\" Cast|url=http://www.darkhorizons.com/news/15889|access-date=July 7, 2014|work=[[Dark Horizons]]|publisher=Dark Futures Pty.

Many of the techniques and tools that were required to give the film the quality Keane demanded did not exist when the project was started, and Walt Disney Animation Studios had to create them on their own.<ref name=AWNDisneyLegacy3D /> Keane said, \"There\u2019s no photoreal hair.

Keane credited Disney 3D animator Kyle Strawitz with helping to combine CGI with the traditional hand-drawn style.<ref name=\"CGMeetup\" /> \"He took the house from ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White]]'' and built it and painted it so it looked like a flat painting that suddenly started to move, and it had dimension and kept all of the soft, round curves of the brushstrokes of watercolor.

Each pair is used individually on each separate element that adds depth to a scene, like background, foreground, and characters, without adjusting for the relation with the other pairs. When sandwiched together later in production, the result was something that would be visually impossible in the real world, but which created an appealing look to the film.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mb.com.ph/node/300278/get-tangled-hairrai|title=Get 'Tangled' up in hair-raising 3D!|work=The Manila Bulletin Newspaper Online|date=January 24, 2011|access-date=June 20, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110130050835/http://www.mb.com.ph/node/300278/get-tangled-hairrai|archive-date=January 30, 2011}}</ref>\n\nAs a counterpart to the appealing and cute design of Rapunzel,<ref name=GirlHowardGrenoInterview>{{cite web|title=Byron Howard & Nathan Greno Tangled Interview|url=http://www.girl.com.au/byron-howard-and-nathan-greno-tangled-blu-ray-interview.htm|publisher=Girl.com.au|access-date=November 1, 2015|date=2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110517021233/http://www.girl.com.au/byron-howard-and-nathan-greno-tangled-blu-ray-interview.htm|archive-date=May 17, 2011|url-status=live}}</ref> the directors wanted to make Flynn Rider \"the most handsome, most attractive male lead Disney has ever had.\"<ref name=SRDisneyHunk>{{cite web|last1=Cornet |first1=Roth |title=Zach Levi on Being a Disney Hunk in 'Tangled', A Singer, A Superhero & 'Chuck |url=https://screenrant.com/disney-tangled-zach-levi-interview-chuck-rothc-88315/ |website=Screen Rant |access-date=November 1, 2015 |date=November 18, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141209125333/http://screenrant.com/disney-tangled-zach-levi-interview-chuck-rothc-88315/ |archive-date=December 9, 2014 }}</ref> They held a large \"Hot Man Meeting\" where they gathered about 30 women from the studio and asked them what they considered attractive in a man.<ref name=TelegraphTangledDirectors>{{cite news|last1=Lee|first1=Marc|title=Tangled directors on the latest Disney animation|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/filmmakersonfilm/8287107/Tangled-directors-on-the-latest-Disney-animation.html|access-date=November 1, 2015|work=The Telegraph|date=January 27, 2011}}</ref> They brought in hundreds of images of their favourite male actors and celebrities, which were torn and pasted back again.<ref name=TelegraphTangledDirectors /><ref name=Disney11Things>{{cite web|title=11 Things You Didn't Know About Tangled|url=http://blogs.disney.com/oh-my-disney/2014/12/26/11-things-you-didnt-know-about-tangled/|publisher=Disney|access-date=November 1, 2015|date=December 26, 2014}}</ref> After much deliberation, his look was eventually narrowed down to one concept drawing.<ref name=SRDisneyHunk /><ref name=TelegraphTangledDirectors />\n\n====Technology development====\nExisting technology continued to present difficulties: in particular, animating hair turned out to be a challenge.
