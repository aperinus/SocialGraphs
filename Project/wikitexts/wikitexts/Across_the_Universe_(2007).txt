The script is based on an original story credited to Taymor, [[Dick Clement]], and [[Ian La Frenais]], and based on the [[Across the Universe|song of the same name]] by [[Lennon\u2013McCartney]]. It incorporates 34 compositions originally written by members of the Beatles. The film stars [[Evan Rachel Wood]], [[Jim Sturgess]], [[Joe Anderson (actor)|Joe Anderson]] and [[T.V. Carpio]], and introduces [[Dana Fuchs]] and [[Martin Luther McCoy]] as actors. [[Cameo appearance]]s are made by [[Bono]], [[Eddie Izzard]], [[Joe Cocker]], and [[Salma Hayek]], among others.\n\n''Across the Universe'' premiered at the [[Toronto International Film Festival]] on September 14, 2007, and was theatrically released in the United States on October 12 by [[Columbia Pictures]]. The film received mixed reviews from critics, with many praising the visuals, cast and singing performances, though criticized the plot and direction. The film was a major box-office bomb, failing to earn even half of its total production budget at the box office. The film received a [[Golden Globe Awards|Golden Globe]] nomination for [[Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture \u2013 Musical or Comedy|Best Motion Picture \u2013 Musical or Comedy]] and an [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Costume Design|Best Costume Design]]. Two members of the supporting cast, [[Carol Woods]] and [[Timothy T. Mitchum]], performed as part of a special Beatles tribute at the [[50th Grammy Awards]].\n\n==Plot==\nSet in the 1960s. Jude Feeney, a shipyard worker in [[Liverpool]], heads to the US to find his [[G.I. (military)|G.I.]] father who conceived him during [[World War II]], whom he has never met. He promises his girlfriend Molly he will stay in touch while he is away.\n\nMeanwhile, in [[New Jersey]], Lucy Carrigan worries about her boyfriend Daniel, who is headed for service in the [[Vietnam War]]. In [[Dayton, Ohio|Dayton]], [[Ohio]], cheerleader Prudence pines for a fellow female cheerleader, and then drops out of school in shame.\n\nJude meets his father Wes, a janitor at [[Princeton University]], but does not particularly bond with him. While on campus, he meets and befriends slacker student Max, who brings him home for [[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving]] He introduces Jude to his family, including Lucy, his younger sister.\n\nMax drops out of college; he and Jude move into a [[Bohemianism|bohemian]] enclave in [[Greenwich Village]] run by a singer, Sadie. Jude becomes a freelance artist and Max a cab driver. Daniel is killed in Vietnam and Lucy attends his funeral. In Detroit, a young African-American boy is killed in the [[1967 Detroit riot|1967 riot]]. His adult brother Jo-Jo, a guitarist, moves to New York for a change of scenery and auditions for Sadie's band. They are soon joined by Prudence who had hitchhiked there.\n\nLucy visits Max in New York before starting college, and she and Jude fall in love. Max,  initially displeased upon learning they slept together, finally gives them his blessing. Later, Max is [[Conscription|drafted]] into the army and sent to Vietnam, as he is no longer a college student protected from the draft. Prudence is attracted to Sadie and becomes depressed when Sadie and Jo-Jo begin a relationship.\n\nLucy becomes increasingly involved in the anti-war movement. Jude remains comparatively apolitical but devoted to her. Sadie is offered a chance to go on a solo tour as a headliner, leading to a bitter breakup between her and Jo-Jo. Jude dislikes the increasing amount of time Lucy spends with the [[Students for a Democratic Society|Students for a Democratic Republic]], led by activist Paco, as he suspects that Paco is attempting to seduce her.\n\nJude storms into the SDR office leading to an argument with Lucy and a fight with Paco after which Jude is thrown out and she breaks up with him. Some time later, Jude follows her to an [[Columbia University protests of 1968|anti-war demonstration at Columbia University]]. When the police arrest Lucy, Paco, and the other activists, Jude's attempts to reach her lead to his arrest as well.\n\nFacing deportation, Jude contacts his father. Wes visits him in jail but has no legal proof that he is his son and thus an American citizen. As a result, Jude is sent back to England. Returning to his job at the Liverpool shipyards, he runs into his former girlfriend Molly and sees that she is heavily pregnant by her current partner. She met him around the time Jude stopped writing her (when he started seeing Lucy).\n\nJo-Jo continues playing solo guitar in bars, while the highly successful Sadie drowns her sorrow and loneliness in alcohol on tour. Max is wounded in Vietnam and sent home. Lucy visits him in the hospital but he is traumatized and dependent on [[morphine]]. Meanwhile, she continues her activities with the SDR and is involved with Paco, but is uncomfortable with him leading [[Weather Underground|the movement deeper into violence]].\n\nLucy leaves Paco and the organization when she finds him making bombs, and she is surrounded by constant reminders of Jude. One of Paco's homemade bombs explodes, [[Greenwich Village townhouse explosion|killing him and his confederates]]. Upon reading this news, Jude fears Lucy is also dead. He learns from Max over the phone that she had left the group beforehand and is alive, and he arranges to return to NYC legally.\n\nJo-Jo and Sadie, who have reconciled, put on a rooftop concert. Max brings Jude to the rooftop. When the police arrive to break up the concert, Jude manages to remain on the roof and begins to sing. The police allow the band to rejoin him. He notices Lucy on the opposite rooftop, standing and looking at him. Lucy and Jude gaze smilingly at each other as the performance concludes.\n\n==Cast==\n<!--  NOTE TO EDITORS: Do not create wiki-links from these character names to articles about Beatles songs IN THIS SECTION OF THE ARTICLE.

All of these songs were written from 1962 to 1969 by the members of [[the Beatles]] ([[John Lennon]], [[Paul McCartney]], [[George Harrison]], and [[Ringo Starr]]) and recorded by the Beatles. Twenty-nine of them are compositions that are officially credited to the songwriting partnership of [[Lennon\u2013McCartney]]. Three are credited to [[George Harrison]]. One title (\"[[Flying (Beatles song)|Flying]]\") is a 1967 composition credited to all four members of the Beatles (Lennon\u2013McCartney\u2013Harrison\u2013Starr).\n\nThirty of the soundtrack's songs feature vocals. Two of them (\"[[And I Love Her]]\" and \"[[A Day in the Life]]\") are brief instrumental versions of songs that were originally written with lyrics, although \"And I Love Her\" is sung in a deleted scene. One song (\"[[Flying (Beatles song)|Flying]]\") was originally written as an instrumental.\n\nTwenty-five of the vocal tracks are performed by one or more of the six lead cast members. Four of the songs are sung by stars with [[Cameo appearance|cameo]] roles ([[Bono]], [[Eddie Izzard]], [[Salma Hayek]] and [[Joe Cocker]]). One song (\"[[Let It Be (Beatles song)|Let It Be]]\") is sung by supporting members of the cast. Another song (\"[[Blue Jay Way]]\") is sung by indie Texan trio [[the Secret Machines]]. In 29 of the vocal tracks, the vocalists are singing on-screen. Two of the vocal tracks (\"[[Blue Jay Way]]\" and \"[[Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds]]\") are sung by off-screen vocalists.\n\nThe remaining three of the 33 tracks are instrumentals. \"Flying\" is performed by the Secret Machines, \"[[And I Love Her]]\" is heard briefly as part of the orchestral score, and \"[[A Day in the Life]]\" is performed on guitar by [[Jeff Beck]] in a version recorded for [[Sir George Martin]]'s 1998 album ''[[In My Life (George Martin album)|In My Life]]''.\n\nIn addition to the Beatles compositions, the soundtrack features an original score composed by [[Elliot Goldenthal]]. Goldenthal worked on Taymor's previous films ''[[Titus (film)|Titus]]'' and ''[[Frida]]''. (Goldenthal and director Taymor have been romantic partners since 1982.)\n\n[[Interscope Records]] has released three variations of the soundtrack from the film\u2014a standard edition and two deluxe editions. The standard edition contains 16 tracks from the film soundtrack, although \"Let It Be\" is shortened, missing the third verse. The first version of the deluxe edition features 31 tracks\u2014all of the vocal performances and one of the three instrumental tracks.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.interscope.com/artist/news/default.aspx/nid/8676/aid/570 |title=Across the Universe Soundtrack : News : Across The Universe Soundtrack available 9/14! |access-date=October 23, 2007 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20071011065242/http://www.interscope.com/artist/news/default.aspx/nid/8676/aid/570 |archive-date= October 11, 2007  |url-status= live}}</ref> In the US, this 31-track version is available solely at [[Best Buy]] stores and in a digital version from iTunes, while in Europe it is available at other retail outlets.

Concerned with the length of director Julie Taymor's cut of the film, [[Revolution Studios]] chairman [[Joe Roth]] tested a sneak preview of a shortened version without first informing Taymor. The incident sparked some heat between the two, later involving [[Sony Pictures]]' [[Amy Pascal]] urging Taymor to agree to the shorter version.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/news/sb/2007-03-20#film1 |title=A Revolt at Revolution? |publisher=IMDb |date=March 20, 2007 |access-date=June 30, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071115025232/http://www.imdb.com/news/sb/2007-03-20#film1 |archive-date=November 15, 2007 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/news/sb/2007-03-21#film2 |title=More Details of Taymor-Roth Feud |publisher=IMDb |date=March 21, 2007 |access-date=June 30, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071114192936/http://www.imdb.com/news/sb/2007-03-21#film2 |archive-date=November 14, 2007 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Waxman |first=Sharon |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/20/movies/20roth.html |title=Film Has Two Versions; Only One Is Julie Taymor's |work=The New York Times |date=March 20, 2007}}</ref> After several months of dispute, Taymor's version was eventually reinstated as the theatrically released version.<ref>{{cite web |last=Douglas |first=Edward |url=http://www.comingsoon.net/news/movienews.php?id=37341 |title=Julie Taymor Soars Across the Universe |website=ComingSoon.net |date=September 18, 2007 |access-date=September 20, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110520104724/http://www.comingsoon.net/news/movienews.php?id=37341 |archive-date=May 20, 2011 |url-status=live }}</ref> While the production budget was originally reported as $45 million, documents from Roth's sale of Revolution Studios revealed the actual cost of the film to be $70.8 million.<ref name=Roth-Records/>\n\n==Release and reception==\nThe film's release date and release pattern became the subject of some media and public discussion.
