A [[co-production (media)|co-production]] between India and United Kingdom, it is directed and produced by [[Richard Attenborough]] from a screenplay written by [[John Briley]]. It stars [[Ben Kingsley]] in the title role. The film covers Gandhi's life from a [[History of Pietermaritzburg|defining moment in 1893]], as he is thrown off from a [[Natal Government Railways|South African train]] for being in a [[White people|whites]]-only compartment, and concludes with his [[Assassination of Mahatma Gandhi|assassination]] and funeral in 1948. Although a practising [[Hinduism|Hindu]], Gandhi's embracing of other faiths, particularly [[Christianity]] and [[Islam]], is also depicted.\n\n''Gandhi'' was released in India on 30 November 1982, in the United Kingdom on 3 December, and in the United States on 8 December. It was praised for a historically accurate portrayal of the life of Gandhi, the Indian independence movement and the deteriorating results of British colonisation on India, its production values, costume design, and Kingsley's performance, which received worldwide critical acclaim. It became a commercial success, grossing $127.8 million on a $22 million budget.\n\nThe film received a leading eleven nominations at the [[55th Academy Awards]], winning eight (more than any other film nominated that year), including for the [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]], and [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] (for Kingsley). The film was screened retrospectively on 12 August 2016 as the opening film at the Independence Day Film Festival jointly presented by the Indian [[Directorate of Film Festivals]] and [[Ministry of Defence (India)|Ministry of Defence]], commemorating the 70th [[Independence Day (India)|Indian Independence Day]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.ijrte.org/wp-content/uploads/papers/v7i5c/E10460275C19.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=24 April 2020 |archive-date=31 July 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200731220539/https://www.ijrte.org/wp-content/uploads/papers/v7i5c/E10460275C19.pdf |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://dff.nic.in/70thIndependance_Day/70_Saal_Independance_Day.pdf |title=Independence Day Film Festival|access-date=29 August 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160909045347/http://dff.nic.in/70thIndependance_Day/70_Saal_Independance_Day.pdf |archive-date=9 September 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://pib.gov.in/newsite/PrintRelease.aspx?relid=148784 |title=Indian Freedom Movement showed to the world the power of non-violence and democratic principles \u2013 Shri Naidu |access-date=24 April 2020 |archive-date=7 March 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210307222954/https://pib.gov.in/newsite/PrintRelease.aspx?relid=148784 |url-status=live }}</ref> The [[British Film Institute]] ranked ''Gandhi'' as the [[BFI Top 100 British films|34th greatest British film of the 20th century]].\n\n==Plot==\nOn [[Assassination of Mahatma Gandhi|30 January 1948]],<ref>pp. 18\u201321, Briley (1983).</ref> on his way to an evening prayer service, an elderly Gandhi is helped out for his evening walk to meet a large number of greeters and admirers. One visitor, [[Nathuram Godse]], shoots him point blank in the chest. His state funeral is shown, the procession attended by millions of people from all walks of life, with a radio reporter speaking eloquently about Gandhi's world-changing life and works.\n\nIn June 1893, the 23-year-old Gandhi is thrown off from a [[Natal Government Railways|South African train]] for being an Indian sitting in a first-class compartment despite having a first-class ticket.<ref>pp. 21\u201324, Briley (1983).</ref> Realising the laws are biased against Indians, he then decides to start a [[Satyagraha|non-violent protest campaign]] for the rights of all [[South African Indians|Indians in South Africa]], arguing that they are [[British subject]]s and entitled to the same rights and privileges. After numerous arrests and unwelcome international attention, the government finally relents by recognising some rights for Indians.<ref>Briley (1983), p. 54, represents Gandhi's final victory in South Africa by depicting [[Jan Smuts|General Smuts]] as telling Gandhi, \"a Royal Commission to 'investigate' the new legislation.... I think I could guarantee they would recommend the Act be repealed.... You yourself are free from this moment.\".</ref>\n\nIn 1915, as a result of his victory in [[Colony of Natal|South Africa]], Gandhi is invited back to [[British Raj|India]], where he is now considered something of a national hero. He is urged to take up the fight for India's independence ([[Swaraj]], [[Quit India]]) from the [[British Empire]]. Gandhi agrees, and mounts a [[Satyagraha|non-violent non-cooperation campaign]] of unprecedented scale, coordinating millions of Indians nationwide. There are some setbacks, such as violence against the protesters, Gandhi's occasional imprisonment, and the 1919 [[Jallianwala Bagh massacre]].\n\nNevertheless, the campaign generates great attention, and [[United Kingdom|Britain]] faces intense public pressure. In 1930, Gandhi protests against the British-imposed [[History of the British salt tax in India|salt tax]] via the highly symbolic [[Salt March]]. He also travels to [[London]] for [[Second Round Table Conference|a conference]] concerning Britain's possible departure from India; this, however, proves fruitless. Gandhi spends much of the [[Second World War]] in prison. During a house arrest, his wife dies. After the war ends,<ref>[[Second World War]] is alluded to in three scenes in the film. Briley (1983) first presents Gandhi, soon after his return from London in the early 1930, as saying \"They are preparing for war. I will not support it, but I do not intend to take advantage of their danger\" (p. 146). Second, after war is underway (as indicated by a newspaper headline), Gandhi is prevented by the British from speaking when he says he will \"speak against war\" (p. 147); Kasturba then tells the British: \"If you take my husband, I intend to speak in his place\" (p. 147), although she too is prevented from speaking. Third, Margaret Bourke-White and Gandhi discuss whether nonviolence could be effective against Hitler (Gandhi says: \"What you cannot do is accept injustice. From Hitler \u2013 or anyone...\", p. 151).</ref> India finally wins its [[Partition of India|independence]].<ref>The British commitment to support Indian independence is indicated in the first scene set after WWII, in which Mountbatten arrives at Delhi Airport and then, in press conference, announces: \"We have come to crown victory with friendship \u2013 to assist at the birth of an independent India and to welcome her as an equal member in the British Commonwealth of Nations... I am here to see that I am the last British Viceroy\" (Briley, 1983, p. 155).</ref> Indians celebrate this victory, but their troubles are far from over. The country is subsequently divided by religion. It is decided that the northwest area and the eastern part of India (current-day [[Bangladesh]]), both places where Muslims are in the majority, will become a new country called [[Pakistan]]. It is hoped that by encouraging the Muslims to live in a separate country, violence will abate. Gandhi is opposed to the idea, and is even willing to allow [[Muhammad Ali Jinnah]] to become the first [[Prime Minister of India]],<ref>Briley (1983), Gandhi to Jinnah: \"I am asking Panditji to stand down. I want you to be the first Prime Minister of India\" (p. 158).</ref> but the [[Partition of India]] is carried out nevertheless. Religious tensions between [[Hindus]] and [[Muslim]]s erupt into nationwide violence. Repulsed by this sudden unrest, Gandhi declares a [[hunger strike]], in which he will not eat until the fighting stops.<ref>In Briley (1983), Gandhi mentions he is on a \"fast\" (p. 168), and later says that he wants \"That the fighting will stop \u2013 that you make me believe it will never start again\" (p. 172).</ref> The fighting does stop eventually.\n\nGandhi spends his last days trying to bring about peace between both nations. He, thereby, angers many dissidents on both sides, one of whom ([[Nathuram Godse|Godse]]) is involved in a conspiracy to assassinate him.<ref>Briley (1983), p. 179.</ref> Gandhi is cremated and his ashes are scattered on the holy [[Ganges|Ganga]].<ref>Briley (1983), p. 180; in the movie/screenplay, the river is not identified.</ref> As this happens, viewers hear Gandhi in another voiceover from earlier in the film.\n\n==Cast==\n\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Ben Kingsley]] as [[Mahatma Gandhi]]\n* [[Rohini Hattangadi]] as [[Kasturba Gandhi]]\n* [[Roshan Seth]] as [[Jawaharlal Nehru]]\n* [[Pradeep Kumar]] as [[V.

In 1952, [[Gabriel Pascal]] secured an agreement with the [[Prime Minister of India]] ([[Jawaharlal Nehru]]) to produce a film of Gandhi's life. However, Pascal died in 1954 before preparations were completed.<ref name=pascal70>See {{cite book |title=The disciple and his devil: Gabriel Pascal, Bernard Shaw |last=Pascal |first=Valerie |year=1970 |publisher=McGraw-Hill |location=New York |isbn=978-0-595-33772-9 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hjmEM5mjhfMC&pg=PA219 |access-date=15 October 2016 |archive-date=17 December 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191217025311/https://books.google.com/books?id=hjmEM5mjhfMC&pg=PA219 |url-status=live }} Page 219 states that \"[[Jawaharlal Nehru|Nehru]] had given his consent, which he confirmed later in a letter to [[Gabriel Pascal|Gabriel]]: 'I feel... that you are the man who can produce something worthwhile.

Kothari insisted that Attenborough meet him to discuss a film about Gandhi.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mkgandhi-sarvodaya.org/short/ev43.htm|title=Gandhi's Inspiring Short Stories|website=www.mkgandhi-sarvodaya.org|access-date=10 May 2018|archive-date=26 March 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180326121347/http://www.mkgandhi-sarvodaya.org/short/ev43.htm|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>Wakeman, John. ''World Film Directors'', Volume 2. The H. W. Wilson Company, 1988, p. 79.</ref> Attenborough agreed, after reading [[Louis Fischer]]'s biography of Gandhi and spent the next 18 years attempting to get the film made. He was able to meet prime minister Nehru and his daughter [[Indira Gandhi]] through a connection with [[Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma|Lord Louis Mountbatten]], the last Viceroy of India. Nehru approved of the film and promised to help support its production, but his death in 1964 was one of the film's many setbacks. Attenborough would dedicate the film to the memory of Kothari, Mountbatten, and Nehru.\n\n[[David Lean]] and [[Sam Spiegel]] had planned to make a film about Gandhi after completing ''[[The Bridge on the River Kwai]]'', reportedly with [[Alec Guinness]] as Gandhi. Ultimately, the project was abandoned in favour of ''[[Lawrence of Arabia (film)|Lawrence of Arabia]]'' (1962).<ref>''Entirely Up To You, Darling'' by Diana Hawkins & Richard Attenborough; paperback; Arrow Books; published 2009. {{ISBN|978-0-099-50304-0}}</ref> Attenborough reluctantly approached Lean with his own Gandhi project in the late 1960s, and Lean agreed to direct the film and offered Attenborough the lead role. Instead Lean began filming ''[[Ryan's Daughter]]'', during which time Motilai Kothari had died and the project fell apart.<ref>Wakeman (1988), p. 81.</ref>\n\nAttenborough again attempted to resurrect the project in 1976 with backing from [[Warner Bros.|Warner Brothers]]. Then prime minister Indira Gandhi declared a [[The Emergency (India)|state of emergency in India]] and shooting would be impossible. Co-producer Rani Dube persuaded prime minister Indira Gandhi to provide the first $10 million from the [[National Film Development Corporation of India]], chaired by [[D. V. S. Raju]] at that time, on the back of which the remainder of the funding was finally raised.<ref>Wakeman (1988), p. 82.</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/article884479.ece|title=Film producer D.V.S.

Sir Richard Attenborough's ''Gandhi'' is one of them.\"<ref name=kroll82/> The movie \"deals with a subject of great importance... with a mixture of high intelligence and immediate emotional impact... [and] Ben Kingsley... gives what is possibly the most astonishing biographical performance in screen history.\" Kroll stated that the screenplay's \"least persuasive characters are Gandhi's Western allies and acolytes\" such as an English cleric and an American journalist, but that \"Attenborough's 'old-fashioned' style is exactly right for the no-tricks, no-phony-psychologizing quality he wants.\"<ref name=kroll82/> Furthermore, Attenborough\n<blockquote>\nmounts a powerful challenge to his audience by presenting Gandhi as the most profound and effective of revolutionaries, creating out of a fierce personal discipline a chain reaction that led to tremendous historical consequences. At a time of deep political unrest, economic dislocation and nuclear anxiety, seeing \"Gandhi\" is an experience that will change many minds and hearts.<ref name=kroll82/>\n</blockquote>\n\nAccording to the [[Museum of Broadcast Communications]] there was \"a cycle of film and television productions which emerged during the first half of the 1980s, which seemed to indicate Britain's growing preoccupation with India, Empire and a particular aspect of British cultural history\".<ref>[http://www.museum.tv/archives/etv/J/htmlJ/jewelinthe/jewelinthe.htm JEWEL IN THE CROWN] {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.today/20120804195658/http://www.museum.tv/archives/etv/J/htmlJ/jewelinthe/jewelinthe.htm |date=4 August 2012 }}, Museum of Broadcast Communication</ref> In addition to ''Gandhi,'' this cycle also included ''[[Heat and Dust (film)|Heat and Dust]]'' (1983), ''[[Octopussy]]'' (1983), ''[[The Jewel in the Crown (TV series)|The Jewel in the Crown]]'' (1984), ''[[The Far Pavilions]]'' (1984) and ''[[A Passage to India (film)|A Passage to India]]'' (1984).\n\n[[Patrick French]] negatively reviewed the film, writing in ''[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]'':\n<blockquote>An important origin of one myth about Gandhi was Richard Attenborough's 1982 film. Take the episode when the newly arrived Gandhi is ejected from a first-class railway carriage at Pietermaritzburg after a white passenger objects to sharing space with a \"coolie\" (an Indian indentured labourer). In fact, Gandhi's demand to be allowed to travel first-class was accepted by the railway company. Rather than marking the start of a campaign against racial oppression, as legend has it, this episode was the start of a campaign to extend racial segregation in South Africa. Gandhi was adamant that \"respectable Indians\" should not be obliged to use the same facilities as \"raw Kaffirs\". He petitioned the authorities in the port city of Durban, where he practised law, to end the indignity of making Indians use the same entrance to the post office as blacks, and counted it a victory when three doors were introduced: one for Europeans, one for Asiatics and one for Natives.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/filmreviews/11528461/Gandhi-film-review-amazing-epic.html|title=Gandhi, film review: 'amazing epic'|work=Martin Chilton|publisher=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]|access-date=5 April 2018|archive-date=22 February 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180222072718/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/filmreviews/11528461/Gandhi-film-review-amazing-epic.html|url-status=live}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n[[Richard Grenier (newspaper columnist)|Richard Grenier]] in his 1983 article, \"The Gandhi Nobody Knows\", which was also the title of the book of the same name and topic, also criticised the film, arguing it misportrayed him as a \"saint\". He also alleged the Indian government admitted to financing about a third of the film's budget.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.commentarymagazine.com/articles/the-gandhi-nobody-knows/|title=The Gandhi Nobody Knows|work=Richard Grenier|date=March 1983|publisher=[[Commentary (magazine)|Commentary magazine]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090226171138/http://history.eserver.org/ghandi-nobody-knows.txt |archive-date=26 February 2009|url-status=live}}</ref> Grenier's book later became an inspiration for [[G. B. Singh]]'s book ''[[Gandhi: Behind the Mask of Divinity]]''. Parts of the book also discuss the film negatively. Singh, a long term critic of Gandhi, also went on to co-author ''[[Gandhi Under Cross Examination]]'' with Timothy Watson.\n\nIn the DVD edition of the 1998 film ''[[Jinnah (film)|Jinnah]]'', the director's commentary of the film makes mention of the 1982 film. In the commentary, both Sir [[Christopher Lee]], who portrayed the older [[Muhammed Ali Jinnah]], and director [[Jamil Dehlavi]] criticised the film ''Gandhi'' for its portrayal of Jinnah, arguing it to be demonising and historically inaccurate.\n\nOne notable person, [[Mark Boyle (Moneyless Man)|Mark Boyle]] (better known as \"The Moneyless Man\") has stated that watching the film was the moment that changed his life and said that after that, he took Mahatma Gandhi's message of peace and non-violence to heart and that the film inspired him to become an activist.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tpuc.org/content/mark-boyle-moneyless-man |title=Mark Boyle - The Moneyless Man {{!}} www.tpuc.org |website=www.tpuc.org |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100415010814/http://www.tpuc.org/content/mark-boyle-moneyless-man |archive-date=2010-04-15}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/green-living-blog/2009/oct/28/live-without-money|title = I live without cash \u2013 and I manage just fine &#124; Mark Boyle|website = [[TheGuardian.com]]|date = 28 October 2009}}</ref>\n\n[[Review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] retrospectively collected 108 reviews and judged 89% of them to be positive, with an average rating of 8.30/10.
