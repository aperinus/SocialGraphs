The film stars an [[ensemble cast]] featuring [[Graciela Borges]], [[Mercedes Mor\u00e1n]], [[Mart\u00edn Adjemi\u00e1n]] and [[Daniel Valenzuela]].\n\nThe film is set in the high plains of northwestern Argentina and portrays the life of a self-pitying Argentine [[bourgeois]] family. It has received critical acclaim.\n\n==Plot==\nMecha, a woman in her 50s with several teenage children and a husband, Gregorio, wants to remain looking young. In order to avoid the hot and humid weather of the city, the family spends the summers in their decaying country estate named La Mandr\u00e1gora. After Mecha falls and injures herself, she is confined to her bed, and takes to [[alcoholism|drinking]]. She resents her gloomy [[Indigenous peoples in Argentina|Amerindian]] servants, whom she accuses of theft and laziness. Mecha's cousin Tali, who lives in a modest house in town with her husband Rafael, makes repeated visits with her brood of young, noisy children to escape from her claustrophobic home. Before long, the crowded domestic situation in both homes strains the families' nerves, exposing repressed family mysteries and tensions that threaten to erupt into violence.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Graciela Borges]] as Mecha\n* [[Mercedes Mor\u00e1n]] as Tali\n* [[Mart\u00edn Adjemi\u00e1n]] as Gregorio\n* [[Daniel Valenzuela]] as Rafael\n* Leonora Balcarce as Ver\u00f3nica\n* Silvia Bayl\u00e9 as Mercedes\n* Sofia Bertolotto as Momi \n* Juan Cruz Bordeu as Jos\u00e9 \n* Noelia Bravo Herrera as Agustina\n* Maria Micol Ellero as Mariana\n* [[Andrea L\u00f3pez]] as Isabel\n* Sebasti\u00e1n Montagna as Luciano\n* Franco Veneranda as Mart\u00edn\n* Fabio Villafane as Perro\n* Diego Baenas as Joaqu\u00edn\n\n==Background==\n[[Lucrecia Martel]]'s screenplay for the film won the Sundance Institute/NHK Award in 1999; this award honors and supports emerging independent filmmakers.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Berkshire|first1=Geoff|title=NHK, Sundance honor int'l filmmakers|url=https://variety.com/2003/film/markets-festivals/nhk-sundance-honor-int-l-filmmakers-1117878958/|website=Variety|access-date=6 May 2018|date=17 January 2003}}</ref> The jury suggested she re-write the script to follow a more traditional structure around one or two protagonists, but she chose instead to retain the script's diffuse nature.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Martin|first1=Deborah|title=The Cinema of Lucrecia Martel|date=2016|publisher=Manchester UP|location=Manchester|pages=32|chapter=''La Ci\u00e9naga'': Distanciation and Embodiment}}</ref>\n\nMartel has said in media interviews that the story is based on \"memories of her own family.\"<ref>[http://www.villagevoice.com/film/0140,taubin,28651,20.html Taubin, Amy].

Film review and interview with Martel, October, 2001.</ref>\n\n==Production==\nTo find the child actors for the film, Martel held 2,400 auditions, 1,600 of which she recorded on video in a garage near her home in [[Salta]], northwestern Argentina.\n\nIn casting the main characters Mecha and Tali, Martel says \"in Salta I didn't find what I was looking for and, instead, I saw a television programme showed to me by a woman friend who knew what I was looking for. Graciela Borges was in it and I realized I had found my character. Mercedes Mor\u00e1n was more difficult because someone I had very much in mind inspired that character. Besides, the character Mercedes played in ''[[:es:Gasoleros|Gasoleros]]'' distracted me, due to the naturalistic language television has, which is the least natural in the world. But I saw her at some point in a magazine in some photographs they had taken of her with her daughter, on holiday, and there, away from the character in ''Gasoleros'', I realized she was the only one for my film, as [[Lita Stantic]] had already suggested.\"<ref>{{cite book|author1=Monteagudo, Luciano|editor1-last=Bernades|editor1-first=Horacio|editor2-last=Lerer|editor2-first=Diego|editor3-last=Wolf|editor3-first=Sergio|title=New Argentine Cinema: Themes, Auteurs and Trends of Innovation|date=2002|publisher=Ediciones Tatanka|location=Buenos Aires|isbn=9789879972830|pages=69\u201378|chapter=Lucrecia Martel: Whispers at ''Siesta'' Time}}</ref>\n\n''La ci\u00e9naga'' was shot entirely in Martel's hometown of Salta.\n\n==Distribution==\n''La ci\u00e9naga'' was first featured at the [[Berlin International Film Festival]] on 8 February 2001. It opened in Argentina on 8 March at the [[Mar del Plata Film Festival]], and received a [[wide release]] in Argentina on 12 April.\n\nThe film enjoyed a long [[film festival]] run, including the [[Karlovy Vary Film Festival]]; the [[Toronto International Film Festival]]; the Warsaw Film Festival; International Film Festival, Rotterdam; the Titanic International Filmpresence Festival, Hungary; the [[Adelaide International Film Festival]]; the Uruguay International Film Festival; and the [[Havana Film Festival]], [[Cuba]].\n\nIt was presented at the [[New York Film Festival]] on 2 October 2001, and opened in [[Los Angeles]] on 12 October.\n\nThe company Energia is the current sales agent for the film.\n\n==Critical reception==\nReview aggregator [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reports that 88% of critics gave the film a positive review, based on 43 reviews, with an [[weighted mean|average rating]] of 6.90/10. The site's consensus states: \"Dense yet impressively focused, ''La Cienaga'' is a disquieting look at domestic dissatisfaction - and a powerful calling card for debuting writer-director Lucrecia Martel.\"<ref>[http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/cienaga/ ''La ci\u00e9naga''] at [[Rotten Tomatoes]].

He believes the \"New Argentina Cinema\" is moving beyond the themes related to the military dictatorship period of the late 1970s and early 1980s. He wrote: \"[Martel's] intense, in-your-face portrait of a dissolute middle class lacks the usual justifying criminal context. Martel simply holds up a mirror to Argentine society, and the result is devastating. Instead of creating an allegory with archetypes, she shows characters that are all too real. When still, her camera is low and close as though we were right on top of the actors.\"<ref>[http://www.offoffoff.com/film/2001/cienaga.php3 Lipfert, David]. ''Offoffoff.com,'' film review, October 12, 2001.</ref>\n\nWhen the film opened in [[New York City]], Amy Taubin of ''[[The Village Voice]]'' wrote, \"Lucrecia Martel's ''La ci\u00e9naga'' is a veritable [[Anton Chekhov|Chekhov]] tragicomedy of provincial life. Making a brilliant debut, Martel constructs her narrative from quotidian incidents, myriad comings and goings, and a cacophony of voices competing for attention...[i]n a debut feature that's assured in every aspect, Martel's direction of the younger members of her cast is particularly notable.\"<ref>Taubin, Amy.
