It also stars [[Bug Hall]], [[Chauncey Leopardi]], and [[Patrick Renna]]. The film is about the antics of a soccer team consisting of a misfit group of small town [[Texas]] kids who are coached by a teacher from [[England]].\n\n==Plot==\nAnna Montgomery, a teacher who is on an exchange program from [[Surrey]], England, is placed into a school in the fictional small town of Elma, Texas. She initially struggles to connect with her students, as they believe they are underachievers doomed to dead end lives. One day, instead of teaching geography to the inattentive class, Anna breaks the globe in an attempt to pique the kids' interest. After some confusion, the children start learning the game of [[Association Football|soccer]]. After the first practice, Anna tells them she has entered them into a league in [[Austin, Texas]], but their first game is the following day. The town Sheriff's Deputy Tom Palmer becomes co-coach while at the same time begins falling for Anna.\n\nThe team travels to Austin to play the Knights, who are the top team in the league. However, none of the kids fully understand know how to play, and they lose 18\u20130. They decide not to play anymore, until they discover the talent of new classmate Juan Morales, but have to persuade his reluctant mother to let him play. The team, now known as the Big Green, steadily improves with Juan, and they go on a remarkable run with a record of eight wins, two losses, and one tie, which earns them a re-match against the Knights in the championship. As the town goes crazy for the final, hometown boy and current Knights coach Jay Huffer returns to Elma, and finds in the bar the drunken and prejudiced father of Kate Douglas, one of the players. He tells Jay, who works as an auditor for the [[IRS]], via bribery that Juan's mother is an illegal immigrant. Later, Tom is forced to investigate the matter, forcing Juan and his mother to flee Elma. Kate is left furious with both her father and Tom over the situation, but Anna convinces her to stay on the team.\n\nOn the day of the championship, Tom searches for Juan, but is unable to find him before the start of the match, and by halftime the team is down 2\u20130. With 10 minutes left in the game, Juan arrives with Tom and his mother, where Tom announces he is now the sponsor for Juan's mother, meaning they can stay in the country. Juan enters the game and sets up Elma's first goal, and with the last kick of the match, scores the equalizer to tie the game, 2-2, forcing the championship to be decided in a [[penalty shoot-out (association football)|penalty shootout]]. In the final round with the score still tied, the Knights captain and son of the coach, Jay Huffer Jr., steps onto the field. The Big Green goalie Larry Musgrove, who suffers from visions of the opposition players becoming \"monsters,\" manages to turn himself into a monster in his own fantasy, in order to psych out the opponent and save the kick. The final kick for the championship is taken by the Big Green's smallest and youngest player, Newt Shaw. He scores on his kick, giving the Big Green the championship. Huffer, having made a bet with Anna if his Knights were to lose, kisses the Big Green's goat mascot, much to his disgust.\n\nThe final scene shows a new billboard in Elma, featuring the team and highlighting their success on the field and in the classroom.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Patrick Renna]] as Larry Musgrove\n* [[Steve Guttenberg]] as Deputy Sheriff Tom Palmer\n* [[Jay O.
