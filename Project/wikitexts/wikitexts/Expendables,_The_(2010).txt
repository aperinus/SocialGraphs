The film co-stars [[Jason Statham]], [[Jet Li]], [[Dolph Lundgren]], [[Randy Couture]], [[Terry Crews]], [[Steve Austin]], [[Mickey Rourke]], and [[Bruce Willis]]. The film was released in the United States on [[Friday the 13th|August 13, 2010]]. It is the first installment in [[The Expendables (film series)|''The Expendables'' film series]]. This was Dolph Lundgren's first theatrically released film since 1995's cyberpunk film ''[[Johnny Mnemonic (film)|Johnny Mnemonic]].''\n\nThe film is about a group of elite mercenaries tasked with a mission to overthrow a Latin American dictator whom they soon discover to be a mere puppet controlled by a corrupt ex-[[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] agent. It pays tribute to the blockbuster action films of the late 1980s and early 1990s. It was distributed by [[Lionsgate Films|Lionsgate]].\n\n''The Expendables'' received mixed reviews<!--STOP, the statistics from Rotten Tomatoes and other review sites belong in the 'Reception' section, not here--> with praise towards the action sequences and cast performances.

The film spawned the sequels ''[[The Expendables 2]]'' (2012), ''[[The Expendables 3]]'' (2014), and ''[[The Expendables 4]]'' (2023).\n\n==Plot==\nAn elite group of mercenaries named ''The Expendables'', who are based in [[New Orleans]] deploys to the [[Gulf of Aden]] to save hostages on a vessel from [[Piracy in Somalia|Somali pirates]]. The team consists of leader Barney Ross, blade specialist Lee Christmas, [[martial artist]] Yin Yang, [[military veteran]] Gunner Jensen, weapons specialist Hale Caesar, and [[Demolition|demolitions expert]] Toll Road. Jensen instigates a firefight, causing casualties for the pirates. He then tries to hang a pirate, but Yang stops him when Ross and the team discourage the idea. Ross reluctantly discharges him from the team. Later, Christmas is upset to discover his girlfriend Lacy has left him for another man. Ross and rival Trench Mauser visit \"Mr.Church\" for a mission. Trench passes the contract to Ross, which is to overthrow dictator General Garza in Vilena, an island in the [[Gulf of Mexico]]. \n\nRoss and Christmas fly to Vilena for undercover reconnaissance and meet their contact, Sandra, but are discovered. It is revealed that ex-[[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] officer James Munroe is keeping Garza in power as a [[figurehead]] for his own profiteering operations, while Sandra is revealed to be Garza's daughter. Ross aborts, but Sandra refuses to leave Vilena. Meanwhile, Jensen approaches Munroe to help and Garza is angered further when Sandra is [[waterboarding|waterboarded]] for information by Munroe. Meanwhile, Lacy has been physically abused by her new man, so Christmas beats him and his friends, revealing what he does for a living. Ross and the group discover that Church is a CIA operative and the real target is Munroe, who has gone rogue and joined forces with Garza to keep the drug money that funds the CIA to himself, but the CIA cannot afford a mission to kill one of their own directly because of bad publicity. \n\nRoss meets tattoo expert and friend Tool to express his feelings. Tool makes a confession about letting a woman commit suicide instead of saving her. Ross is then motivated to go back for Sandra alone, but Yang accompanies him. Jensen and hired men pursue them on the road, ending in an abandoned warehouse, where Yang and Jensen fight a second time. Ross shoots Jensen when he attempts to impale Yang on a pipe. Jensen makes amends and gives the layout of Garza's palace. Ross boards the plane with Yang and finds the rest of the team waiting, and they infiltrate Garza's compound. Thinking Munroe hired the team to kill him, Garza has his soldiers' faces painted, preparing them for a fight. The team plants explosives throughout the site but Ross, while saving Sandra, is captured by Munroe's henchmen. The team saves him and kills the Brit, but is pinned down by Garza's men as Paine wrestles Ross. \n\nCaesar fights back and Paine escapes. Garza finally stands up to Munroe, ordering him out and returning his money. Instead, as Garza rallies his men against the Americans, Munroe kills him and escapes with Paine and Sandra. Garza's men open fire against the team, who fight their way through, detonating the explosives and destroying the compound. Toll kills Paine by burning him alive while Ross and Caesar manage to destroy the helicopter before Munroe can escape. Ross and Christmas catch up to Munroe, killing him and saving Sandra. Later, Ross gives his mission reward to Sandra to restore Vilena. The team has returned home and are celebrating at Tool's tattoo parlor with the recovering and now redeemed Jensen. Christmas and Tool play a game of [[knife throwing]], during which Christmas composes a mocking poem about Tool, then throws a [[Bullseye (target)|bullseye]] from outside the building.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:The Expendables Comic-Con Panel.jpg|thumb|Crews, Austin, Stallone, Lundgren and Couture promoting ''The Expendables'' at the 2010 [[San Diego Comic-Con International]].]]\n{{See also|List of characters from The Expendables film series}}\n<!-- per Opening Credits -->\n* [[Sylvester Stallone]] as Barney Ross\n* [[Jason Statham]] as Lee Christmas\n<!-- \"and\" in the opening credits before the title presentation -->\n* [[Jet Li]] as Yin Yang\n<!-- rest of opening credits title cards -->\n* [[Dolph Lundgren]] as Gunner Jensen\n* [[Eric Roberts]] as James Munroe\n* [[Randy Couture]] as Toll Road\n* [[Stone Cold Steve Austin|Steve Austin]] as Paine\n* [[David Zayas]] as General Garza\n* [[Giselle Iti\u00e9]] as Sandra\n<!-- listed two at a time in opening credits -->\n* [[Charisma Carpenter]] as Lacy \n* [[Gary Daniels]] as The Brit\n<!-- \"with\" credit in opening credits -->\n* [[Terry Crews]] as Hale Caesar\n<!-- \"and\" credit in opening credits -->\n* [[Mickey Rourke]] as Tool\n<!-- not listed in credits for the film -->\n* [[Bruce Willis]] as Mr. Church <!-- not listed in credits for the film--><ref name=\"Willis\" />\n* [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] as Trench Mauser (uncredited cameo)<ref name=\"Willis\" />\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nIn mid-2005, writer [[David Callaham]] submitted the first draft of a mercenary-inspired action film titled \"''Barrow''\" to [[Warner Bros.]], as part of his \"blind commitment\" deal with the studio at the time.
