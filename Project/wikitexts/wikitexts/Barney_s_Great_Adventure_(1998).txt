The plot follows Barney, along with three young children named Cody, Abby, and Marcella, as they discover a magical egg in a barn. After learning that the egg is a dream maker, Barney and the gang must return the egg to the barn before it hatches. The film was written by [[Stephen White (television writer)|Stephen White]], directed by [[Steve Gomer]], produced by [[Sheryl Leach]] and [[Lyrick Studios]] and released by [[PolyGram Filmed Entertainment]] on March 27, 1998 at [[Radio City Music Hall]] in New York and worldwide on April 3, 1998 in the United States and Canada at the height of Barney's popularity.\n\nThe film received mixed to negative reviews and was a [[Box-office bomb|box office bomb]], only grossing $12 million against a budget of $15 million. This was the third and final film to be produced by Lyrick Studios before it was acquired by and folded into [[HIT Entertainment]] on August 31, 2001. It is also the only theatrical Barney film as all other Barney films were just direct to video productions.\n\n==Plot==\n<!--Per [[WP:FILMPLOT]], plot summaries for feature film articles should be less than 700 words in length.-->\nCody, Abby, and Fig Newton, alongside Abby's best friend Marcella Walker are dropped off to the Newton's grandparents' farm for a whole week during summer break. As Cody believes there's nothing exciting at the farm, Abby and Marcella rub a Barney doll in his face. Cody starts a game of \"keep-away\" by taking the Barney doll and running off with it. The two go after Cody, who hides the doll in the bathroom. The girls catch up with Cody, who tells them to use their imagination and laughs when he thinks that nothing happened. However, the doll comes to life as Barney the Dinosaur takes the girls to play in the barn. Cody refuses to believe in Barney, and claims that real dinosaurs don't talk.\n\nThat night after dinner, the whole family is outside the front porch where Cody further discusses how Barney was in their barn and was not just a little doll. Grandpa then sings Let Me Call You Sweetheart to Grandma before he goes back inside with her and Fig. Right on cue, Barney appears after Fig and their grandparents went back inside and they sing Twinkle Twinkle Little Star before Abby and Marcella go back inside to play in the attic. Barney then gives Cody advice to wish upon a star. Cody takes his advice and wishes for a real adventure that summer and to do things no one else has done before. A shooting star deposits an egg in the barn, and Cody discovers it the next day. Barney and the kids go tell their grandparents about this, but Barney gets distracted when he hears Fig cry. Grandma suggests to Abby and Marcella that they go see Mrs. Goldfinch. Cody finds Barney in the baby room and takes him to see his grandparents, but Abby and Marcella take Cody and Barney to see Mrs. Goldfinch, who tells them that the egg is a dreammaker. Cody accidentally knocks the egg off the table which lands on a birdseed truck. Barney and the others recover it through a parade as the egg avoids being cracked by the people in the parade. Barney's friend B.J. catches it when it almost lands on the ground, but tosses it away. Barney and the gang chase the egg through a French restaurant where Barney sings If All The Raindrops, a circus where Barney and the kids sing We're Gonna Find A Way, and finally, they fly through the sky to continue their pursuit of it. However, they eventually make it back to the barn in time. All the while, Baby Bop is looking for her blanket and B.J. and Baby Bop arrive just in time to see the egg hatch.\n\nAfter they return the egg to the barn, it finally hatches into a koala-like being named Twinken who shows everyone Abby's dream, then Barney's. Cody apologizes to Barney for being mean and says that he's cool. Barney accepts his apology and tells Cody he thinks he's cool too and the two share a hug. Twinken shows everyone a magical fireworks display which lands in Barney's arms. Barney begins to sing \"I Love You\", and the rest of the cast sings with him. Baby Bop gets sleepy, which prompts B.J. to decide they are ready to go home. The film ends with Twinken sitting next to Barney who has reverted into his doll form.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* David Joyner as Barney (costume)\n** [[Bob West]] as Barney (voice)\n* [[Trevor Morgan (actor)|Trevor Morgan]] as Cody Newton\n* Diana Rice as Abigail \"Abby\" Newton\n* [[Kyla Pratt]] as Marcella Walker\n* Jeff Ayers as Baby Bop (costume)\n** Julie Johnson as Baby Bop (voice)\n* Jeff Brooks as B.J.

John Petrakis wrote in the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'', \"If my 21-month-old son had any inkling that I was giving a less than stellar review to [this film,] he would no doubt shoot me that look he tends to give when his milk is warm or his Cheerios a bit stale.\"<ref>{{cite news|title= In Barney Film, Purple Guy Gets Room To Roam|work= Chicago Tribune|date=1998-04-03|url= http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1998-04-03/entertainment/9804030074_1_barney-friends-barney-film-big-adventure|access-date=2010-09-09|first=John|last=Petrakis}}</ref> ''[[The New York Times]]''' Anita Gates wrote that it was a film \"his young, undemanding fans are likely to enjoy.\"<ref>{{cite news|title= FILM IN REVIEW&nbsp;\u2013 Review|work= The New York Times|date=1998-03-27|url= https://www.nytimes.com/library/film/032798barney-film-review.html|access-date=2015-10-05|first=Anita|last=Gates}}</ref>\n\nAnother review, from the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', read: \"The creators of the great purple scourge, Barney the Dinosaur, have an unspoken contract with parents palatable for all involved: We buy their videos and an occasional plush toy for our 3- and 4-year-olds and make Barney's brain trust obscenely wealthy; they in turn create benignly lobotomized entertainment that holds our non-demanding kids in thrall; our kids watch TV and allow us a few precious minutes of peace. The most important element is parental trust in Barney to be blandly wholesome, so that we have to endure only a few seconds of it while we cue up the VCR for our tykes. Family movies, on the other hand, imply a rather different contract: Parents buy tickets and popcorn for the whole family; filmmakers deliver light entertainment that kowtows to kids yet is not so brain-dead as to alienate sentient adults. 'Barney's Great Adventure: The Movie,' the first theatrical film featuring the green-bellied beast, takes that big old fat foot of Barney's and stomps that contract beyond recognition. [. . .] The flat lighting and two-dimensional sets of the TV screen serve Barney far better than a modestly expanded budget and a director insistent on using locations, romantic lighting and mildly adventurous camera angles. Barney looks both more real and more magical on video; on film, he's clearly a doofus in a felt outfit.\"<ref>{{cite news|title= Barney Chases Magical Egg in 'Adventure'|work= Los Angeles Times|date=1998-04-03|url= https://articles.latimes.com/1998/apr/03/entertainment/ca-35440|access-date=2010-09-09|first=David|last=Kronke}}</ref>\n\nThe [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reported an approval rating of 32% with an average score of 5.00/10, based on 25 reviews.
