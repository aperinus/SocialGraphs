Set in 1977 [[Los Angeles]], the film focuses on a private eye (Gosling) and a tough enforcer (Crowe) who team up to investigate the disappearance of a teenage girl (Qualley).\n\n''The Nice Guys'' premiered on May 11, 2016, in [[Hollywood, Los Angeles|Hollywood]], screened on May 15 at the [[2016 Cannes Film Festival]], and was released by [[Warner Bros. Pictures]] in the United States on May 20, 2016. It received positive reviews from critics for its humor, mystery, and the performances of Crowe and Gosling. It grossed $62 million on a $50 million budget.<ref name=\"reviews\">{{cite news |url=https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/envelope/cotown/la-et-ct-movie-projector-20160517-snap-story.html |title=Captain America' faces new 'Neighbors' and 'Angry Birds' at box office |first=Ryan |last=Faughnder |date=May 18, 2016 |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]}}</ref>\n\n== Plot ==\nIn 1977 [[Los Angeles]], down-on-his-luck private eye Holland March is hired by porn star Misty Mountain's aunt, Mrs. Glenn, who claims to have seen Misty still alive after her death. March's investigation leads him to Amelia Kuttner, an associate of Misty who pays violent enforcer Jackson Healy to scare March away.\n\nHealy is interrogated by two thugs, \"Blueface\"<!-- single word in closing credits -->\u2009\u2014\u2009so named after he sets off a [[dye pack]] while searching Healy's apartment\u2009\u2014\u2009and Older Guy, about Amelia. Healy wards them off with a shotgun and teams up with a reluctant March to find Amelia first.\n\nMarch and Healy question Amelia's anti-pollution protest group and meet Chet, who brings them to the burnt-down house of Amelia's boyfriend Dean, who died in the fire. They learn that Amelia and Dean were working with Misty on an \"experimental film\"\u2009\u2014\u2009combining pornography and [[investigative journalism]].\n\nThe two infiltrate a party in search of the film's financier, Sid Shattuck. Healy discovers the film is missing, while March drunkenly finds Shattuck dead and unknowingly crosses paths with Amelia. March's daughter Holly, having snuck along to the party, stops Blueface from killing Amelia. Blueface is struck in a hit-and-run, and Amelia flees. Healy subdues Older Guy and finds Blueface dying. Blueface tells Healy his boss has dispatched a hit man named John Boy to kill all witnesses. Healy discreetly kills Blueface. The police arrive at the scene, and March and Healy are met by Amelia's mother, Judith Kuttner, a high-ranking official in the [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department]], who claims Amelia is delusional. Judith hires the duo to find her daughter.\n\nMarch and Healy go to an airport hotel where Amelia is meeting with distributors for the film. John Boy has arrived ahead of them; they witness the businessmen being slaughtered and hastily retreat, only for Amelia to land on their car, shoot at them, and knock herself unconscious. They take her to March's house, where she accuses her mother of colluding with car markers to suppress the [[catalytic converter]], which regulates exhaust emissions. Amelia created the film to expose their collusion and believes her mother has had everyone connected to the film killed.\n\nMarch tells Judith's assistant Tally that Amelia has been found and is at March's house. Tally tells them that Judith has requested they deliver a briefcase of $100,000 to Judith and informs them the family's doctor will go to March's house to check on Amelia. When March crashes the car, the briefcase flies open to reveal shredded magazines; the delivery was a diversion to leave Amelia unprotected. John Boy arrives at March's house disguised as the family doctor, attacks Holly and her friend Jessica, and engages in a shootout with March and Healy. As John Boy evades the police, Amelia flees the house and unwittingly flags down his car, only to be killed.\n\nThe police question and release March and Healy, who have no evidence that Judith is behind the murders. March realizes that Mrs. Glenn saw Misty in a film projected against a wall. At Misty's house, they discover a film projector, but the film is missing. They realize that Chet is the projectionist for the [[LA Auto Show|Los Angeles Auto Show]] and will try to screen the film at the event. At the auto show, Tally intercepts Healy and March at gunpoint. Holly distracts Tally, who is knocked unconscious. Amelia's film, which Chet spliced into the auto show presentation, implicates the auto executives. On the rooftop March struggles with Older Guy, who falls to his death as March lands in the pool after both fell from the roof. Holly stops Tally from reaching the film. Healy overpowers John Boy but spares his life at Holly's ultimatum, and March secures the film from thugs sent by the auto executives.\n\nJudith is arrested but insists that it was Detroit who wanted Amelia dead; she hired March and Healy to keep Amelia safe. Judith remarks that while she will go to jail, Detroit has still gotten away with trying to suppress the catalytic converter. Later, at a bar on [[Christmas Eve]], March shows Healy an advertisement for their new detective agency called \"The Nice Guys\".\n\n== Cast ==\n<!--- per opening credits order --->\n* [[Russell Crowe]] as Jackson Healy\n* [[Ryan Gosling]] as Holland March \n* [[Angourie Rice]] as Holly March\n* [[Matt Bomer]] as John Boy / Dr. Malek\n* [[Margaret Qualley]] as Amelia Kuttner\n* [[Yaya DaCosta]] as Tally\n* [[Keith David]] as Eddie Harris, Older Guy<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cL5RsUCuC90|title=Keith David at 'THE NICE GUYS' premiere in Hollywood on Fabulous TV|via=www.youtube.com}}</ref>\n* [[Beau Knapp]] as Blueface<!--- single word in closing credits --->\n* [[Lois Smith]] as Mrs. Glenn\n* [[Murielle Telio]] as Misty Mountains\n* [[Gil Gerard]] as Bergen Paulsen\n* [[Daisy Tahan]] as Jessica\n* [[Jack Kilmer]] as Chet\n* [[Kim Basinger]] as Judith Kuttner\n* Lance Valentine Butler as Kid On Bike\n* [[Ty Simpkins]] as Bobby \n* [[Hannibal Buress]] as Bumble\n* [[Robert Downey Jr.]] as Sid Shattuck (uncredited)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://screenrant.com/robert-downey-non-marvel-movies-2010s/|title=Robert Downey Jr Has Only Done 5 Non-Marvel Movies In The Last Decade|date=October 20, 2019|website=ScreenRant}}</ref>\n\n== Production ==\n===Development===\nLike Black's previously directed film ''[[Kiss Kiss Bang Bang]]'', ''The Nice Guys'' takes inspiration from [[Brett Halliday]], namely his novel ''Blue Murder''.<ref name=from>{{cite book|title=The Nice Guys: From Script to Screen|first=Shane|last=Black|pages=7\u201310|year=2016|publisher=Rizzoli|ISBN=978-0-8478-4981-9}}</ref> Black initially wrote a version of the script along with Anthony Bagarozzi in 2001 which established the characters but otherwise was vastly different.<ref name=\"Slashurbanwestern\">{{cite web|last1=Giroux|first1=Jack|title=Interview: 'The Nice Guys' Director Shane Black Discuses His Latest Urban Western|url=https://www.slashfilm.com/the-nice-guys-shane-black-interview/|website=Slashfilm|access-date=16 June 2016|page=1}}</ref> According to Black, each would start with one detective, he with March and Bagarozzi with Healy. Along the way, they swapped characters and eventually wrote a first draft. This version of the script failed to attract any buyers, and then Black reworked it into a 64-page version that would serve for a [[television pilot]]. [[CBS]] became attracted to it, but given the contents led to many objections by the [[Broadcast Standards and Practices (US)|Standards and Practices]] department, it eventually did not progress.<ref name=from/> Black would later, upon promoting the release of the final film, speak disparagingly of the idea of the television series, stating that such a show \"wouldn't have been any good\".<ref name=\"Slashurbanwestern\"/> By 2009, Bagarozzi suggested changing the film from a contemporary setting to the 1970s. Black's producer friend [[Joel Silver]] was initially wary of the idea as he felt audiences would not be as welcoming to a [[period piece]], but he changed his mind after producing ''[[Sherlock Holmes (2009 film)|Sherlock Holmes]]''.<ref name=silver>{{cite web|url=http://pro.boxoffice.com/action-packed-career-producer-joel-silver-nice-guys/|title=An Action-Packed Career: Producer Joel Silver on 'The Nice Guys'|website=BoxOfficePro|date=May 18, 2016|author=Milczarski, Kathryn}}</ref> Black stated the change in time period helped as in contrast to \"the divisiveness that we see now\", the 1970s was full of multiculturalism and \"was the aftermath of the protests and you got a sense that we are all in it together\". The contents also drew from films of the period such as ''[[Vanishing Point (1971 film)|Vanishing Point]]'' and ''[[Five Easy Pieces]]''.<ref name=iw/> Bagarozzi noted how the title ''The Nice Guys'' aimed to be ironic and non-descriptive, as the two main characters were \"literally the two worst people that we could think of and then trying to make that fun,\" given \"one breaks arms for a living and the other cons old ladies out of money.\"<ref name=premiere/>\n\n===Casting===\nAfter Black completed ''[[Iron Man 3]]'' in 2013, Silver asked him what he wanted to do next, and he expressed interest in doing ''The Nice Guys''.<ref name=silver/> The scripts were sent to [[Ryan Gosling]] and [[Russell Crowe]], and both wound up taking the roles specially for the prospect of working with one another. Gosling even stated that when he read the script already picturing Crowe as Healy, \"the movie just immediately became so funny\" as he had never seen Crowe in a similar role.<ref>{{cite
