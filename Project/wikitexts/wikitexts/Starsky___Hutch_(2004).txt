The film stars [[Ben Stiller]] as David Starsky and [[Owen Wilson]] as Ken \"Hutch\" Hutchinson and is a film adaptation of the original [[Starsky & Hutch|television series of the same name]] from the 1970s.\n\nTwo streetwise undercover cops in the fictional city of Bay City, California in 1975 bust drug criminals with the help of underworld boss Huggy Bear. The film is a [[prequel]] to the television series, as it portrays Starsky and Hutch being first partnered. The film also switches the personalities of the title characters. While in the television show, Starsky was curious and streetwise, and Hutch was by-the-book, in the film, Starsky is the serious cop, and Hutch is laid-back. There are four [[Frat Pack]] members in this film, although not all are in major roles.\n\nThe film was released on March 5, 2004, received mixed to positive reviews from critics and was commercially successful, earning $170 million worldwide on a $60 million budget.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1975, two Bay City Police detectives, the macho David Starsky (who loves his [[Ford Torino]] and recklessly pursues minor offenders) and the easy-going Ken \"Hutch\" Hutchinson (who often works alongside criminals to investigate their activity) are forced to become partners as punishment for recent antics. Meanwhile, Jewish-American drug kingpin Reese Feldman and his right-hand man Kevin Jutsum develop a new type of cocaine that is untraceable in scent and taste. When one of his dealers botches an operation, Feldman kills him.\n\nThe body washes ashore a few days later, and Starsky and Hutch investigate the scene. A clue leads them to Feldman, who denies any knowledge of the crime, but his wife mentions the dealer had been dating a cheerleader. After meeting cheerleaders Stacey and Holly, the detectives are given a jacket from cheerleader Heather. Their street-wise informant Huggy Bear directs the pair to Big Earl's motorcycle bar. Disguised as \"Captain America\" and \"Billy\" from ''[[Easy Rider]]'', Starsky and Hutch learn that Big Earl is in jail, where they question him on his connection to Feldman's illicit dealings; Big Earl forces the detectives into humiliating acts in exchange for information and a packet of what they believe is cocaine. However, Captain Doby, angered by their wild interrogation, dismisses their packet as nothing more than artificial sweetener and takes them off the case.\n\nThe duo invite Stacey and Holly to Starsky's place where Starsky puts the \u201csweetener\u201d in his coffee while Hutch sings \"[[Don't Give Up on Us (song)|Don't Give Up on Us]]\". The four visit a disco where Starsky, suffering the effects what proves to be Feldman's modified cocaine, loses a dance-off. Hutch takes him home and puts him to bed, then proceeds to have a threesome with Stacey and Holly.\n\nThe duo are then assaulted by an Asian dealer and his knife-wielding son, working for Feldman. After an interrogation, they deduce that Feldman stores the drugs in his garage. They go undercover as mimes at his daughter's [[Bat Mitzvah]]; confronting Feldman, Starsky shoots the lock off his garage door, inadvertently killing a pony inside that had been a gift for his daughter. Feldman exonerates them, figuring the botched operation will take heat off him, but Doby indefinitely suspends both detectives, and though Starsky defends Hutch, Doby reveals a complaint Starsky filed against Hutch weeks ago. Starsky tries to explain himself to Hutch, but an argument leads to a split in their friendship.\n\nA bomb meant for Hutch instead injures his young neighbor Willis. Visiting him in the hospital, Starsky and Hutch reconcile and decide to shut down Feldman's drug business. Aided by Huggy Bear, who grudgingly serves as Feldman's golf caddie, they learn that Feldman plans to sell the drugs at a charity ball by hiding them in Volkswagen Karmann Ghias to be given away to other dealers.\n\nThe duo enter the party in disguise with Stacey and Holly as their dates. Deducing Feldman's plan, they shoot open a VW's trunk, revealing the large stash of cocaine. Feldman takes Hutch hostage, and Starsky, attempting to rescue him, accidentally shoots Captain Doby in the shoulder, though Hutch declares Reese was responsible. In the confusion, Feldman and his girlfriend Kitty escape with the money from the cocaine deal, leading Starsky and Hutch on a car chase through a golf course.\n\nAs Feldman and Kitty take off in his yacht, Starsky and Hutch try to ramp Starsky's Torino off a pier in pursuit, but jumps way off course and lands in the sea. The two manage to escape to safety. Meanwhile, Huggy, hiding on board, knocks Feldman out with a golf club that Feldman had accused him of losing, and takes one of Feldman's money briefcases for himself.\n\nCelebrating the capture of Feldman, Jutsum, and Kitty, Starsky mourns the loss of his car. Huggy surprises him with another Gran Torino (bought from the original Starsky and Hutch duo, [[David Soul]] and [[Paul Michael Glaser]]). The two partners roll out on another case in their new ride.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Ben Stiller]] as Detective David Starsky\n* [[Owen Wilson]] as Detective Ken \"Hutch\" Hutchinson\n* [[Vince Vaughn]] as Mr. Reese Feldman\n* [[Snoop Dogg]] as Huggy Bear Brown\n* [[Jason Bateman]] as Kevin Jutsum\n* [[Fred Williamson]] as Captain Doby\n* [[Carmen Electra]] as Stacey Haack\n* [[Amy Smart]] as Holly Monk\n* [[Juliette Lewis]] as Kitty\n* [[Molly Sims]] as Mrs. Feldman\n* [[George Cheung]] as Chau\n* [[Chris Penn]] as Manetti\n* [[Terry Crews]] as Porter\n* [[Brande Roderick]] as Heather\n* Jeffrey Lorenzo as Willis Lewis\n* [[Har Mar Superstar]] as Dancing Rick\n* [[Patton Oswalt]] as Disco DJ\n* [[Paul Michael Glaser]] as Original Starsky\n* [[David Soul]] as Original Hutch\n* [[Will Ferrell]] as Big Earl Drennan (''uncredited'')<ref>{{cite news |author=Phoebe Flowers |url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/2004-03-05/entertainment/0403050363_1_stiller-and-wilson-ferrell-starsky-hutch |title=Stiller, Wilson Serve Up A Hilarious Slice Of '70s Cheese |work=Sun-Sentinel |location=Fort Lauderdale, Florida |date=March 5, 2004 |access-date=2017-01-03 |quote=...and Ferrell, in an uncredited role as a convict with a dragon fetish... }}</ref>\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Reception==\nOn [[Rotten Tomatoes]] the film has an approval rating of 62% based on 193 reviews, with an average rating of 6/10.
