It takes place in the fictional Watt High School, in the suburbs of [[Portland, Oregon]], and chronicles the events surrounding a school shooting, based in part on the 1999 [[Columbine High School massacre]]. The film begins a short time before the shooting occurs, following the lives of several characters both in and out of school, who are unaware of what is about to unfold. The film stars mostly new or non-professional actors, including [[John Robinson (American actor)|John Robinson]], [[Alex Frost]], and Eric Deulen.\n\n''Elephant'' is the second film in Van Sant's \"[[Gus Van Sant#Death Trilogy|Death Trilogy]]\"\u2014the first is ''[[Gerry (2002 film)|Gerry]]'' (2002) and the third ''[[Last Days (2005 film)|Last Days]]'' (2005)\u2014all three of which are based on actual events.\n\nAlthough ''Elephant'' was controversial for its subject matter and allegations of influence on the [[Red Lake shootings]], it was generally praised by critics and received the [[Palme d'Or]] at the [[2003 Cannes Film Festival]], in which [[Patrice Ch\u00e9reau]] was the head of the jury.\n\n==Plot==\nAt the start of the film, John McFarland is being driven to school by his father, who is driving erratically down the road. Noticing the damage done to the car, John realizes that his father is drunk and makes him move to the passenger seat so he can drive. When John arrives at school late, he is reprimanded by the principal, Mr. Luce.\n\nThe majority of the film is spent following several high school students going about their daily lives just before a school shooting. In addition to John, who struggles with controlling his alcoholic father, photography student Elias builds a portfolio of other students. Outcast Michelle struggles with her body issues and assists in the library. Bulimics Nicole, Brittany, and Jordan gripe about their parents and squabble while popular athlete and lifeguard Nathan meets with his girlfriend, Carrie. Acadia, a close friend of John's, attends a Gay-Straight Alliance meeting.\n\nUnknown to anyone, two other students, Alex and Eric, are preparing to carry out a bomb/shooting attack on their school. Flashbacks throughout the film show them preparing for the massacre by ordering weapons online and formulating an attack plan. The two have a brief sexual encounter in the shower after they both admit that they've never kissed anyone before. Their motives for the shooting appear vague; the film provides evidence suggesting bullying, neglect, violent video games, and Nazism.\n\nOn the day of the shooting, the pair make their way to school in Alex's car. Alex is armed with a [[Carbon 15|Carbon-15]] and a shotgun while Eric has a [[TEC-9]]. As they enter the school, they encounter John, and Alex tells him to leave. Realizing what is about to happen, John tries to warn students and teachers outside not to go into the school, but few people listen. He then notices his dad is missing after they arrived earlier and goes looking for him.\n\nAlex and Eric plant propane bombs in the cafeteria, hoping to blow it up and shoot people as they try to escape the fire. When the bombs fail, they decide to start [[Spree killing|shooting indiscriminately]]. The pair head into the library, where Elias photographs them right before they open fire on students. Michelle is killed, while Elias' fate is left unclear. Other students quickly realize that the gunfire is real and begin to panic, and teachers begin evacuating students.\n\nAlex and Eric split up to opposing ends of the school to continue their shooting. Alex enters the girls' bathroom where he surprises Jordan, Nicole, and Brittany, presumably shooting all three. A student attending the Gay-Straight Alliance meeting enters the hallway investigating the gunfire and is shot dead. The alliance members evacuate through a window save for Acadia, who freezes at the sight of her dead classmate. Benny, an African-American student athlete, finds her and helps her out the window before deciding to find and confront the shooters.\n\nOutside the school, John finds his now sobered-up father, who tries to comfort his son as the shooting continues. While helping students escape, Mr. Luce is cornered and threatened by Eric, prompting Mr. Luce to try and reason with him. Benny walks up behind Eric, but Eric abruptly turns around and shoots Benny dead. Eric tells Mr. Luce not to treat kids like him and Alex poorly. He then lets Mr. Luce go, only to gun him down seconds later.\n\nAlex enters the cafeteria, which is strewn with overturned chairs, backpacks, several dead bodies, and numerous abandoned half-eaten lunches, and sits down. Alex picks up a cup from an abandoned lunch and casually drinks from it. Eric meets up with him, and they have a brief conversation about who they've shot, which ends when Alex shoots Eric mid-sentence. Alex leaves the cafeteria, showing no emotion over killing Eric, and discovers Carrie and Nathan hiding in a freezer. He tauntingly recites \"[[Eeny, meeny, miny, moe]]\" to them to decide whom he should kill first. The film then cuts to credits leaving the ending ambiguous.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Alex Frost]] as Alex, the more intelligent of the two killers, implied to be the one in charge. He is an accomplished but frustrated [[Piano|pianist]] and sketch artist. He and Eric kiss before the massacre, both citing the fact that they had never been kissed.\n* Eric Deulen as Eric, a [[slacker]], Alex's friend, and the other killer. He is less intelligent than Alex, and Alex is obviously aware of this.  He is shot in the chest by Alex near the end of the film, while talking about whom he had killed earlier. \n* [[John Robinson (American actor)|John Robinson]] as John McFarland, Alex's friend who has trouble at school while managing his [[alcoholic]] father.  Alex warns him to stay away from the massacre. \n* [[Timothy Bottoms]] as Mr. McFarland, John's alcoholic father.\n* [[Matt Malloy]] as Mr. Luce, the [[Principal (school)|principal]] of the school. Cornered by Eric, who briefly spares him, he is presumed dead after being shot several times.\n* [[Elias McConnell]] as Elias, a [[photography]] student building his portfolio with portraits of other students.\n* Nathan Tyson and Carrie Finklea as Nathan and Carrie, a popular [[lifeguard]]/[[American football|football player]] and his girlfriend. Alex taunts them with [[Eeny, meeny, miny, moe]].  \n* Kristen Hicks as Michelle, a [[nerdy]] girl ashamed of her body. The film follows her through the locker room and into the [[library]] where she assists, it is there that she is the first to die in the massacre.\n* Brittany Mountain, Jordan Taylor, and Nicole George as Brittany, Jordan, and Nicole, three [[Bulimia nervosa|bulimic]] girls who talk incessantly, gripe about parents, and squabble with one another.\n* Bennie Dixon as Benny, an athletic student who helps Acadia escape out of a window before approaching Eric. He is shot and presumed dead.\n* Alicia Miles as Acadia, a close friend of John and a member of the [[Gay-Straight Alliance]]. She is assumed to have a [[panic disorder]] which causes her to freeze and break down in times of fear or stress. During the shooting, Benny discovers her standing still in a classroom and helps her escape from the school and the shooters.\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Blind men and elephant3.jpg|right|thumb|350px|The title was inspired by the parable of the [[blind men and an elephant]].]]\nThe film began as a [[documentary]] that Van Sant had intended to make about the [[Columbine High School massacre]]; eventually, the idea of a [[non-fiction|factual account]] was dropped.<ref name=\"Crean\">{{cite news |last1=Crean |first1=Ellen |title=2003: Shades Of Columbine |url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/2003-shades-of-columbine/ |access-date=9 December 2018 |work=cbsnews.com |date=21 May 2003 |language=en}}</ref>\n\n''Elephant'' was filmed in Van Sant's hometown, [[Portland, Oregon]], in late 2002, on the former campus of Whitaker Middle School (previously [[Adams High School (Portland, Oregon)|Adams High School]]).

The Whitaker/Adams building, completed in 1969, was torn down in 2007.\n\nThere was no initial script before the filming started.

But it isn't violent in the way it presents those deaths. There is no pumped-up style, no lingering, no release, no climax. Just implacable, poker-faced, flat, uninflected death. [[Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut|Truffaut]] said it was hard to make an anti-war film because war was exciting even if you were against it. Van Sant has made an anti-violence film by draining violence of energy, purpose, glamor, reward and social context. It just happens. I doubt that ''Elephant'' will ever inspire anyone to copy what they see on the screen. Much more than the insipid message movies shown in social studies classes, it might inspire useful discussion and soul-searching among high school students.\"<ref>{{cite news |last=Ebert |first=Roger |author-link=Roger Ebert |date=7 November 2003 |title=Elephant |work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]] |url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/elephant-2003 |via=Rogerebert.com}}</ref>\n\n===Accolades===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\"| Award\n! scope=\"col\"| Date of ceremony\n! scope=\"col\"| Category\n! scope=\"col\"| Recipient(s)\n! scope=\"col\"| Result\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\"| {{Abbr|Ref(s)|Reference(s)}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| [[Bodil Awards]]\n| rowspan=\"1\" | [[58th Bodil Awards|27 February 2005]]\n| [[Bodil Award for Best American Film|Best American Film]]\n| rowspan=\"7\" | [[Gus Van Sant]]\n| {{nom}}\n| rowspan=\"1\" | <ref>{{Cite web |date=14 February 2005 |title=Bodil og Oscar inviterer til filmfest p\u00e5 DR |url=https://www.dr.dk/presse/bodil-og-oscar-inviterer-til-filmfest-paa-dr |access-date=21 June 2017 |publisher=[[DR (broadcaster)|DR]] |language=da}}</ref>\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" rowspan=3|  [[Cannes Film Festival]]\n| rowspan=\"3\" | [[2003 Cannes Film Festival|14 \u2013 25 May 2003]]\n| [[Palme d'Or]]\n| {{won}}\n| rowspan=\"2\" | <ref name=\"festival-cannes.com\">{{cite web |url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/films/elephant |title=ELEPHANT |access-date=21 June 2017 |work=festival-cannes.com}}</ref>\n|-\n| [[Best Director Award (Cannes Film Festival)|Best Director]]\n| {{won}}\n|-\n| Cinema Prize of the French National Education System\n| {{won}}\n| <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/dialogue-gus-van-sant-136802 |title=Dialogue: Gus Van Sant |author=Gregg Goldstein |date=21 May 2007  |access-date=21 June 2017 |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]}}</ref>\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"|  [[C\u00e9sar Awards]]\n| rowspan=\"1\" | [[29th C\u00e9sar Awards|21 February 2004]]\n| [[C\u00e9sar Award for Best Foreign Film|Best Foreign Film]]\n| {{nom}}\n| rowspan=\"1\" | <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://variety.com/2004/film/awards/bon-showing-for-rappeneau-1117898958/ |title='Bon' showing for Rappeneau |author=Alison James |date=23 January 2004 |access-date=21 June 2017 |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]}}</ref> \n|-\n! scope=\"row\"|  [[French Syndicate of Cinema Critics]]\n| rowspan=\"1\" | 15 January 2004\n| Best Foreign Film\n| {{won}}\n| rowspan=\"1\" | <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.thehindu.com/2005/08/22/stories/2005082200780200.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170621235420/http://www.thehindu.com/2005/08/22/stories/2005082200780200.htm |url-status=dead |archive-date=21 June 2017 |title=Feast for movie buffs |author=G.
