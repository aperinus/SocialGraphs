Starring [[Emile Hirsch]], [[Christina Ricci]], [[John Goodman]], [[Susan Sarandon]], [[Matthew Fox (actor)|Matthew Fox]], [[Roger Allam]], [[Benno F\u00fcrmann]], [[Hiroyuki Sanada]], [[Rain (entertainer)|Rain]] and [[Richard Roundtree]], the plot revolves around Speed Racer, an 18-year-old automobile racer who follows his apparently deceased brother's career, choosing to remain loyal to his family and their company Racer Motors, which causes difficulties after he refuses a contract that E.P. Arnold Royalton, owner of Royalton Industries, offers him.\n\nA live action ''Speed Racer'' film had been in [[development hell]] since 1992, having changed actors and filmmakers until in 2006 when producer [[Joel Silver]] and the Wachowskis collaborated to begin production on ''Speed Racer'' as a [[Children's film|family film]]. ''Speed Racer'' was shot in and around [[Potsdam]] and [[Berlin]] from June to August 2007. [[Michael Giacchino]] composed the film's score.\n\n''Speed Racer'' premiered on April 26, 2008 at the [[Microsoft Theater|Nokia Theater]], followed by its general theatrical release on May 9, 2008, by [[Warner Bros. Pictures]]. The film grossed $93 million worldwide on a $120 million budget, making it a [[Box-office bomb|commercial failure]]. It was subsequently nominated in multiple categories at the [[Teen Choice Awards]] as well as the [[Golden Raspberry Awards]]. Upon initial release, the film received mixed reviews, who praised the action sequences, musical score by Michael Giacchino, cinematography, and performances, critics were divided on its overuse of computer generated imagery, and criticized its screenplay and runtime. In subsequent years, ''Speed Racer'' has garnered a strong [[cult following]] with some commentators calling it \"underrated\" and a \"misunderstood\" film.\n\n== Plot ==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films are 400 to 700 words only. -->\nSpeed Racer is a young man whose life and love has always been automobile racing. His parents Pops and Mom run the independent Racer Motors, in which his brother Spritle and his pet chimp Chim Chim, his mechanic Sparky and his girlfriend Trixie are also involved. As a child, Speed idolized his record-setting older brother, Rex Racer, who was apparently killed while racing in the Casa Cristo 5000, a deadly cross-country rally race. Now embarking on his own career, Speed is quickly sweeping the racing world with his skill behind the wheel of his brother's [[Mach Five|Mach 5]] and his own T-180 car the Mach 6, although primarily interested in the art of the race and the well-being of his family.\n\nOne day, E.P. Arnold Royalton, [[Chief executive officer|CEO]] of conglomerate Royalton Industries, offers Speed an astoundingly luxurious lifestyle in exchange for signing to race with him. Though tempted, Speed declines because his father's distrust of power-hungry corporations. Angered, Royalton reveals that for many years, key races have been [[match fixing|fixed]] by corporate interests, including himself, to gain profits. Royalton takes out his anger on Speed by having his drivers force Speed into a crash that destroys the Mach 6 and suing Racer Motors for [[intellectual property infringement]]. Speed gets an opportunity to retaliate through Inspector Detector, head of an intelligence agency's corporate crimes division. Racer Taejo Togokahn supposedly has evidence that could indict Royalton but will only offer it up if Speed and the notorious masked Racer X agree to race on his team in the upcoming Casa Cristo 5000, which could also substantially raise the stock price of his family's racing business, blocking a Royalton-arranged buyout. Speed agrees but keeps his decision secret from his family, and Detector's team makes several defensive modifications to the Mach 5 to assist Speed in the race.\n\nAfter they drive together and work naturally as a team, Speed begins suspecting that Racer X is actually Rex in disguise. His family discovers that he has entered the race and agree to support him, though Pops is angry with him for not asking permission to race earlier. With his family and Trixie aiding him, Speed defeats many brutal racers, who were bribed by fixer Cruncher Block to stop him, and overcomes seemingly insurmountable obstacles to win the race, while Detector's team arrests Block. However, Taejo's arrangement is revealed to be a sham, as he was only interested in increasing the value of his family's company to profit from Royalton's buyout. Enraged, Speed hits the track that he used to drive with his brother, and confronts Racer X with his suspicion that he is Rex. Racer X removes his mask, revealing an unfamiliar face, and tells Speed that Rex is indeed dead, but advises Speed to not let racing change the way he is and figure out his own driving. Speed returns home and plans to leave, but Pops expresses his pride in Speed's actions, and that he was wrong to not let Speed enter the race since his own stubbornness drove Rex away, before finding out about the race-fixing conspiracy. Taejo's sister Horuko unexpectedly arrives and gives him Taejo's rejected automatic invitation to the upcoming Grand Prix. The Racer family bands together and builds a new Mach 6 in 32 hours.\n\nSpeed enters the Grand Prix with the help of Inspector Detector against great odds; Royalton has placed a $1,000,000 bounty on his head that the other drivers are eager to collect, and he is pitted against future Hall of Fame driver Jack \"Cannonball\" Taylor. Speed overcomes a slow start to catch up with Taylor, who uses a cheating device called a spearhook to latch the Mach 6 to his own car. Speed uses his jump jacks to reveal the device to video cameras, causing Taylor to crash and lose. Speed wins the race, having successfully exposed Royalton's crimes. While Racer X watches, a [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]] [[montage (filmmaking)|montage]] reveals that he really is Rex, having faked his death, attended his own funeral, and undergone [[plastic surgery]] to change his appearance as part of his plan to protect Speed and racing. He chooses not to reveal his identity to his family, declaring that he must live with his decision. The Racer family celebrates Speed's victory as Speed and Trixie kiss, Taejo testifies against Royalton and Block, and Royalton is sent to jail for his actions.\n\n== Cast ==\n[[File:Emile Hirsch and Christina Ricci by David Shankbone.jpg|thumb|right|[[Emile Hirsch]] and [[Christina Ricci]] at the [[Tribeca Film Festival]] premiere]]\n* [[Emile Hirsch]] as [[Speed Racer]]\n** Nicholas Elia as young Speed Racer\n* [[Christina Ricci]] as Trixie, Speed's girlfriend.\n** [[Ariel Winter]] as young Trixie\n* [[John Goodman]] as Pops Racer, Speed's father\n* [[Susan Sarandon]] as Mom Racer, Speed's mother\n* [[Matthew Fox]] as [[Racer X (character)|Racer X]], a mysterious masked racer tasked with exposing the corruption undermining the WRL.\n* [[Scott Porter]] as Rex Racer, Speed Racer's older brother and idol presumed to have been killed in a race\n* [[Roger Allam]] as E.P.
