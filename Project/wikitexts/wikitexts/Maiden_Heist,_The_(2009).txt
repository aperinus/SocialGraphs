Macy]] and [[Marcia Gay Harden]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.realmovienews.com/news/1306|title=Freeman, Walken and Macy chase Lonely Maidens!}}</ref> The film was released as ''The Heist'' in the United Kingdom.\n\n==Plot==\n\nRoger ([[Christopher Walken]]) is a security guard at an art museum, where he spends a lot of time staring at his favorite painting, ''The Lonely Maiden'', a beautiful woman staring forlornly out into the distance. Despite the fact he has a wife, Rose ([[Marcia Gay Harden]]), he has become rather obsessed with the painting. Rose wants Roger to retire so they can move to [[Florida]]. One afternoon, Roger learns that several pieces including ''The Lonely Maiden'' are to be permanently moved to another museum in [[Copenhagen]], [[Denmark]]. Unable to follow the maiden, Roger falls into despair until he meets Charles ([[Morgan Freeman]]), another guard who has a similar attraction to a painting on another floor, a painting of a woman with cats.\n\nGeorge ([[William H. Macy]]) is also obsessed with a piece of art, a nude sculpture of a Greek warrior; he often strips down and poses naked beside it during his night shift. Using the advantages between their shifts and experience, George comes up with the idea to steal their favorite works of art and replace them with replicas. Roger volunteers to tag the artworks being shipped, while Charles and George seek assistance in replicating their favorites. Because Charles is a painter, he's able to do the cat painting perfectly, but he fails in capturing ''The Lonely Maiden''. The men hire a street artist ([[Breckin Meyer]]) for that task, forcing Roger to steal Rose's Florida vacation savings to pay for the job. Rose becomes suspicious and nearly ends up having Roger taken off the volunteer staff. George manages to replicate \"his\" sculpture and the ''Maiden'' copy is also completed.\n\nOn the day of the switch, George sneaks into the warehouse in the crate with the statue. He successfully swaps the three marked pieces, but can't resist stripping down and posing with the statue. A guard shows up, forcing George to hide in the crate without his clothes. The next morning, when Roger and Charlie (with the unwitting accompaniment of Rose) come to collect him, the crate containing George ends up in the wrong van. A panic-stricken Charlie gives chase, and they manage to successfully rescue George, who emerges from the shipping crate unclothed, much to Rose's shock.\n\nHaving pulled off the heist without getting caught, they retire from their jobs and Rose is none the wiser. On a trip to Florida, Roger is enthralled by Rose as she looks out over the ocean because she strikingly resembles the ''Lonely Maiden'' pose. Their love life is rekindled. Meanwhile, the three men hide their treasures in a shack on Charles' apartment roof so that they can go and view them at their leisure. However, when Roger looks at the painting, it doesn't inspire him like it once did. He smiles and remembers his wife. Meanwhile, in Copenhagen, a guard on duty passes ''The Lonely Maiden'' copy and looks at it, smiling.\n\n==Cast==\n\n* [[Morgan Freeman]] as Charles Peterson\n* [[Christopher Walken]] as Roger Barlow\n* [[William H.
