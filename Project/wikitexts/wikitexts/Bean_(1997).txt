Based on the [[British sitcom]] series ''[[Mr. Bean]]'' created by [[Rowan Atkinson]] and Curtis, the film stars Atkinson in the [[Mr. Bean (character)|title role]], with [[Peter MacNicol]], [[Pamela Reed]], [[Harris Yulin]], [[Sandra Oh]] and [[Burt Reynolds]] in supporting roles. In the film, Bean works as a security guard at the [[National Gallery]] in [[London]] before being sent to the [[United States]] to talk about the unveiling of the painting ''[[Whistler's Mother]]''.\n\nProduced by [[Gramercy Pictures]], [[Working Title Films]], and [[Tiger Aspect Productions|Tiger Aspect Films]], ''Bean'' was released in the United Kingdom on 2 August 1997 and in the United States on 7 November 1997 by [[PolyGram Filmed Entertainment]] and [[Universal Pictures]]. The film received mixed reviews from critics but was a box-office success, having grossed $251.2 million worldwide against an $18 million budget.<ref name=\"BOM\" /> A [[Sequel|standalone sequel]], ''[[Mr. Bean's Holiday]]'', was released in 2007.\n\n==Plot==\nWell-meaning yet clumsy and destructive [[Mr. Bean (character)|Mr. Bean]] works as a [[security guard]] at the [[National Gallery]] in [[London]]. When the gallery's board of directors, who despise Bean for sleeping on the job, fail to fire him under the chairman's orders, they instead select Bean as their representative for the transfer of [[James Abbott McNeill Whistler|James McNeill Whistler]]'s 1871 portrait ''[[Whistler's Mother|Arrangement in Grey and Black No.1]]'' (''Whistler's Mother'') to the Grierson Art Gallery in [[Los Angeles]], purchased by philanthropist General Newton for $50 million, in an attempt to get rid of him for a while.\n\nGrierson's curator David Langley, impressed with the false profile of \"Dr. Bean\", offers to accommodate Bean in his home for two months against his family's wishes. After Bean pranks the airport police by pretending to have a gun and accidentally destroys the family's prized possessions, David's wife, Alison, leaves for her mother's house along with their children, Kevin and Jennifer. David then begins to question Bean's status as an art expert following a visit to [[Pacific Park]], where Bean is arrested by Lieutenant Brutus - the same police officer who interrogated him at the airport - after speeding up a [[simulator ride]] to make it more exciting for him. After Bean accidentally ruins a dinner with Mr. Grierson and his wife, David discovers that Bean is not a doctor and knows nothing about art.\n\nThe next day, Bean accidentally sneezes on ''Whistler's Mother'' and damages the painting with an ink-stained tissue and [[lacquer thinner]] while cleaning it. Fearing that the damage would cost him his job and possibly get him prosecuted, David becomes despondent and gets drunk with Bean, though his family returns out of pity. That night, determined to save David's career, Bean sneaks back into the gallery, incapacitates the security guard with [[laxative]]s and replaces the defaced ''Whistler's Mother'' with a reprinted poster of it coated in [[egg white]]s and [[nail polish]] to resemble the real one, which successfully fools everyone at the ceremony the next day. Bean gives a speech about the painting, expressing an improvised and sentimental opinion about it that wins the crowd's approval.\n\nBrutus informs David that Jennifer has recently got into a motorcycle accident with her boyfriend, prompting David and Bean to rush to the hospital. While wandering around the hospital, Bean gets mistaken for a surgeon and is forced into a surgery room, where he encounters Brutus - who has been shot while dealing with a mugging on the way to the hospital - and saves his life by inadvertently removing the bullet from his body. David then begs Bean, unaware of his true identity, to wake Jennifer up from her unconscious state, in which he succeeds after an accident with a [[defibrillator]] sends Bean flying and landing on her. Grateful for having their daughter back and wondering how to repay their doctor, David and Alison are surprised when Bean reveals his true identity. Per Bean's suggestion, they repay him by allowing him to stay with them for one more week.\n\nBean spends quality time together with David and his family, before David accompanies him back to the airport for his flight home to London and thanks him for everything as he departs. At home, Bean goes to sleep with his bedroom now decorated with photographs of his time in Los Angeles, as well as the original ''Whistler's Mother'' painting he smuggled back with him.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n*[[Rowan Atkinson]] as [[Mr. Bean (character)|Mr. Bean]]\n*[[Peter MacNicol]] as David Langley\n*[[John Mills]] as Chairman\n*[[Pamela Reed]] as Alison Langley\n*[[Harris Yulin]] as George Grierson\n*[[Burt Reynolds]] as General Newton\n*[[Richard Gant]] as Lieutenant Brutus\n*[[Larry Drake]] as Elmer\n*[[Sandra Oh]] as Bernice Schimmel\n*[[Danny Goldring]] as Security Buck\n*[[Johnny Galecki]] as Stingo Wheelie\n*[[Chris Ellis (actor)|Chris Ellis]] as Detective Butler\n*[[Andrew Lawrence (actor)|Andrew Lawrence]] as Kevin Langley\n*[[Peter Egan]] as Lord Walton\n*[[Peter Capaldi]] as Gareth\n*[[June Brown]] as Delilah\n*Peter James as Doctor Rosenblum\n*[[Tricia Vessey]] as Jennifer Langley\n* [[Tom McGowan]] as Walter Huntley\n}}\n\n==Production==\nIn November 1991, a year after the [[Mr. Bean|original series]] premiered, ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' announced that [[20th Century Fox]] was producing a [[film adaptation]] of ''Mr. Bean'' in association with the show's production company, [[Tiger Aspect Productions|Tiger Television]], after the studio remade two sketches from the series into short films released theatrically, ''[[List of Mr. Bean episodes#Remake sketches|Mr. Bean Takes an Exam]]''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://youtube.com/watch?v=29ZmXkICT1g&feature=youtu.be|title = Mr Bean Takes an Exam (1991) &#91;4K&#93;|website = [[YouTube]]}}</ref> and ''[[List of Mr. Bean episodes#Remake sketches|Mr. Bean Goes to a Premi\u00e8re]]''.<ref name=\"MrBeanFox\">{{cite news|url=https://variety.com/1991/tv/awards/brit-hit-set-for-date-in-states-99126691/|title=Brit Hit Set For Date In States|work=Variety|access-date=27 December 2021}}</ref> The film was later instead produced by the UK-based [[Working Title Films]] and [[PolyGram Filmed Entertainment]], under the latter's [[Gramercy Pictures]] banner.\n\n===Deleted and alternative scenes===\nThe North American release differs from the international release, as it includes an additional scene in which David suggests that Bean stuff the turkey while he distracts the Griersons during the dinner party.

When searching the refrigerator, Bean first finds two frankfurters and then the onion that he offers as an appetizer. Upon finding the turkey, David asks him if he has cooked a turkey before and he replies, \"Oh yes.\" After the two shove the turkey into the microwave oven, Bean suggests running it for 20 minutes as opposed to the 5-hour cooking time suggested by David, which cause the turkey to explode.<ref>{{cite web|title=Bean.
