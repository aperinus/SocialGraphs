The novel has been the subject of [[Vanity Fair (novel)#Adaptations|numerous television and film adaptations]]. Nair's version made notable changes in the development of main character [[Becky Sharp]], played by [[Reese Witherspoon]].\n\nThe film received several awards and nominations, including being nominated for the [[Golden Lion]] at the 2004 [[Venice Film Festival]].\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1802 UK, Becky Sharp, orphaned daughter of a poor painter, has finished her studies and offered to be governess to Sir Pitt Crawley's daughters. Before starting, she travels to [[London]] with her close friend Amelia Sedley and family. While there she begins a campaign to charm Amelia's awkward and overweight brother \"Jos\" Sedley, a wealthy trader living in [[India]]. Smitten with Becky, he almost proposes, but is dissuaded by Amelia's snobbish fianc\u00e9 George Osborne, reminding him that Becky has no dowry.\n\nNot finding a rich husband, Becky takes up her post. Horrified by the house and her employer Sir Pitt, she diligently teaches his daughters and prepares the house for his half-sister Miss Crawley. His youngest son, Rawdon Crawley, an army captain, comes with them and immediately fancies Becky. She manages to secure a post with ill-tempered Miss Crawley.\n\nMeanwhile, Amelia's prospective father-in-law, Mr. Osborne, is trying to arrange a more advantageous marriage for his son George. When George refuses to consider her, Mr. Osborne bankrupts Mr. Sedley, forcing George to break his engagement to Amelia. She now lives in squalor with her family, but hopeful he will come for her, believing the gift of a piano from George's friend Dobbin is from George himself.\n\nRawdon Crawley and Becky marry secretly, but Miss Crawley soon finds out expelling her from her house and disinheriting Rawdon. George Osborne marries Amelia, rebelling against his father, and is soon after deployed with Dobbin and Rawdon to [[Belgium]], as [[Napoleon]] escaped [[Elba]] and returned to France. Becky and Amelia accompany their husbands. The newly-wedded Osborne tires of Amelia, and hits on Becky. The ball they are attending is interrupted by an announcement that Napoleon has attacked, and they must march in three hours. Before leaving, Rawdon gives Becky all he's won at cards. The next day, as she tries to flee the city, she sees Amelia in the mob and leaves her carriage to be with her in [[Brussels]], waiting out the battle.\n\nIn the ensuing [[Battle of Waterloo]], George is killed and Rawdon survives. Amelia bears his son, also named George. Mr. Osborne refuses to acknowledge his grandson, so Amelia returns to live in poverty with her parents. Now-Major William Dobbin, young George's godfather, continues to show his love for the widowed Amelia by small kindnesses. She is too in love with George's memory to return Dobbin's affections. Saddened, he transfers to an army post in India. Meanwhile, Becky's son is also named after his father.\n\nSeveral years pass. Rawdon has been passed over for inheritance by both his aunt and father, and they are sinking deep into debt. Amelia struggles to raise her son and reluctantly gives him up to be raised by his grandfather Mr. Osborne, for a fine education and lifestyle. Bailiffs arrive to repossess the Crawleys' furniture, but Becky is saved by their neighbor Lord Steyne, who she remembers from the past as a keen buyer of her father's paintings. He becomes her patron, giving her money and introducing her into London high society.\n\nOn the night of her triumphant presentation to [[King George IV]], Becky receives word that Rawdon has been arrested and thrown into debtors' prison. Lord Steyne insists she spend the night with him in return for the services he has rendered her, and Rawdon, after being bailed out by his sister-in-law, walks in on Steyne forcing himself upon Becky. He throws him out, but realizes Becky has been taking money for months in secret without sharing with him. He leaves her, entrusting the care of their son to his older brother, the new Sir Pitt and his wife.\n\nTwelve years later, Becky is a card dealer at a casino in [[Baden-Baden]], Germany. Rawdon died from [[malaria]] soon after leaving her, while posted to a tropical island by Lord Steyne. She comes across Amelia's grown son George Jr., who invites her to tea with his mother. Mr. Osborne finally accepted Amelia, leaving her and George Jr. a large inheritance. Becky confronts Amelia over her obsession with the late George, showing her a love note from him to her many years earlier. She urges Amelia to love Dobbin, who has been loyal for many years. Although at first angered, Amelia realizes her mistake and declares her love to Dobbin.\n\nAlone again in the casino, Becky meets Jos Sedley, who has come to Germany after Amelia told him Becky was there. He invites her to come and live in India with him, and she delightedly accepts. They depart to make a new life for themselves.\n\n==Cast==\n{{colbegin}}\n*[[Reese Witherspoon]] as [[Becky Sharp (character)|Rebecca \"Becky\" Sharp Crawley]]\n*Angelica Mandy as a young Becky Sharp\n*[[Romola Garai]] as Amelia Sedley Osborne\n*[[Sophie Hunter]]<ref>{{cite web|last1=Cook|first1=Emma|date=14 January 2005|title=Hunter The Fox|url=http://sophiehunter.net/post/124027327098/hunter-the-fox-by-emma-cook-london-evening|website=London Evening Standard}}</ref> as Maria Osborne\n*[[James Purefoy]] as Colonel Rawdon Crawley\n*[[Jonathan Rhys-Meyers]] as Captain George Henry Osborne\n*[[Rhys Ifans]] as Major William Dobbin\n*[[Eileen Atkins]] as Miss Matilda Crawley\n*[[Geraldine McEwan]] as the Countess of Southdown\n*[[Gabriel Byrne]] as the Marquess of Steyne\n*[[Bob Hoskins]] as Sir Pitt Crawley the Elder\n*[[Douglas Hodge]] as Sir Pitt Crawley the Younger\n*[[Natasha Little]] as Lady Jane Sheepshanks Crawley\n*[[John Woodvine]] as Lord Bareacres\n*[[Barbara Leigh-Hunt]] as Lady Bareacres\n*[[Nicholas Jones (actor)|Nicholas Jones]] as Lord Darlington\n*[[Sian Thomas]] as Lady Darlington\n*[[Trevor Cooper]] as General Tufto\n*[[Kelly Hunter]] as the Marchioness of Steyne\n*[[Camilla Rutherford]] as Lady Gaunt\n*[[Alexandra Staden]] as Lady George\n*[[Jim Broadbent]] as Mr. Osborne\n*[[Tony Maudsley]] as Joseph \"Jos\" Sedley\n*[[John Franklyn-Robbins]] as Mr. John Sedley\n*[[Deborah Findlay]] as Mrs. Mary Sedley\n*[[Daniel Hay (actor)|Daniel Hay]] as little George \"Georgy\" Osborne the Younger\n*[[Tom Sturridge]] as a young George \"Georgy\" Osborne the Younger\n*[[Kathryn Drysdale]] as Rhoda Swartz\n*[[Ruth Sheen]] as Miss Pinkerton\n*[[Richard McCabe]] as [[King George IV]]\n*[[Gledis Cinque]] as an older Celia Crawley \n*[[William Melling]] as the young Rawdy Crawley \n*[[Robert Pattinson]] as an older Sir Rawdon \"Rawdy\" Crawley the Younger (deleted scenes)<ref>{{cite news|last=Vena|first=Jocelyn|title=Robert Pattinson Says Playing Reese Witherspoon's Love Interest Was 'Bizarre'|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1662138/robert-pattinson-reese-witherspoon-water-for-elephants.jhtml|access-date=July 26, 2011|publisher=MTV|date=April 18, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Ryan|first=Mike|title=Is Robert Pattinson on Team Jacob in Water for Elephants?

[[Mira Nair]] became attached to the project in 2002 and scrapped most of the initial screenplay. She brought [[Julian Fellowes]] in to rewrite the film; he agreed with her that the character of Becky Sharp should be made more sympathetic than in the novel.<ref name=mercy/> The ending was also changed, with Becky journeying to India with Joseph Sedley. The film had a budget of $23 million and originally was supposed to be in pre-production for 18 weeks. However, Reese Witherspoon became pregnant so it was necessary to speed up both pre-production and filming.

He later revealed that he discovered his scenes were cut during the premiere screening.\n\n==Reception==\nCritics gave the film mixed reviews.
