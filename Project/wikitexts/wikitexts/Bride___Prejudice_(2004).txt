The screenplay by Chadha and [[Paul Mayeda Berges]] is a [[Bollywood]]-style [[Film adaptation|adaptation]] of [[Jane Austen]]'s 1813 novel ''[[Pride and Prejudice]]''. It was filmed primarily in English, with some [[Hindi]] and [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]] dialogue. The film was released in the United Kingdom on 6 October 2004 and in the United States on 11 February 2005. It has received mostly positive reviews from critics.\n\n==Plot==\nLalita Bakshi is a young woman living in [[Amritsar]], India with her family. The family is invited to a friend's wedding ceremony, where Lalita meets Will Darcy, a handsome and wealthy American who is a long-time friend of the Indian-British [[barrister]] Balraj, and Balraj's sister Kiran. Balraj is instantly attracted to Jaya and likewise, Darcy is attracted to Lalita. During the wedding reception, Lalita takes a disliking to Darcy but when Balraj invites Jaya to [[Goa]], Mr. Bakshi asks Lalita to go with them and she eventually agrees to do so. In [[Goa]], Lalita and Darcy clash over their ideas on men and women and India's economic future. Later that night on the beach, Lalita meets Johnny Wickham, Darcy's former friend from [[London]], and he validates her low opinion of Darcy.\n\nThe Bakshi family is visited by Kohli Saab, a family friend living in [[Los Angeles]], who has come to India to find a \"traditional woman\" to marry. When Kohli Saab is attracted to Jaya, Mrs. Bakshi steers him towards Lalita, making Lalita uncomfortable. Wickham is invited to join the family and Kohli Saab at the [[Garba (dance)|Garba]], despite Mrs. Bakshi's disapproval. Lalita happily accepts a dance from Wickham, even as Darcy and Kiran warn her against becoming involved with him. Lalita angers her mother by turning down a proposal from Kohli.\n\nBalraj comes to the house to bid farewell to Jaya and promises to write to her from [[London]]. Lakhi later announces that Chandra is marrying Kohli Saab, much to the surprise of Jaya and especially Lalita. The same night, Wickham also announces that he is leaving and promises to write to Lalita. Neither Balraj nor Wickham writes to the two older sisters, but Wickham is shown secretly writing to Lakhi. Kohli Saab and Chandra phone to invite the Bakshi family the wedding ceremony in Los Angeles. The family accepts and Jaya is excited to stopover in [[London]] hoping to see Balraj again.\n\nIn London, Kiran informs the Bakshi family that Balraj is in [[New York City|New York]] to meet potential brides, devastating Jaya, Lalita and Mrs Bakshi. At [[Heathrow Airport]], Lakhi, Jaya, Lalita and Mrs Bakshi coincidentally run into Darcy, who is also a guest at Kohli Saab and Chandra's wedding. On board Darcy offers his [[First class travel|First class]] seat to Mrs. Bakshi so he can sit next to Lalita in [[Economy class]] for the remainder of the flight. During their stay in California, Lalita's opinion of Darcy slowly improves, and the two fall in love.\n\nAt the wedding, Darcy's condescending mother, Catherine, introduces Lalita to Darcy's former girlfriend, Anne who mispronounces Lalita's name as \"Lolita\". Jaya and Lalita also meet Darcy's younger sister, Georgie, who tells Lalita that Balraj and Darcy are not in contact because Darcy persuaded Balraj not to marry an Indian girl with a \"[[Gold digger|gold-digger]]\" Mother. Lalita furiously realizes that Darcy is the reason why Jaya never heard from Balraj. Darcy proposes to Lalita, who angrily refuses, blaming him for Jaya's unhappiness.\n\nBack in London, Lakhi uses the family's layover as an opportunity to sneak away and meet Wickham. Darcy apologizes to Lalita, telling her that he has gotten Balraj to reconcile with Jaya. Lalita realizes that Darcy was right about Wickham and calls for his help to find Lakhi. Darcy explains that Wickham got Georgie pregnant at age 16, tried to marry her for their family's money, and ran away when his plan did not work. They both rescue Lakhi and Lalita accepts Darcy's proposal. The film ends with a double wedding of Jaya to Balraj and Lalita to Darcy.\n\n==Cast==\n\nNames in parentheses are the characters in the original Austen novel.\n\n* [[Aishwarya Rai]] as Lalita Bakshi/Lalita William Darcy ([[Elizabeth Bennet]])\n* [[Martin Henderson]] as William \"Will\" Darcy ([[Fitzwilliam Darcy]])\n* [[Anupam Kher]] as Mr Chaman Bakshi ([[Mr. Bennet (Pride and Prejudice)|Mr Bennet]]), Lalita's Father\n* [[Nadira Babbar]] as Mrs Manorama Bakshi (Mrs Bennet), Lalita's Mother\n* [[Naveen Andrews]] as Mr Balraj Uppal (Mr Bingley), Will's best friend\n* [[Namrata Shirodkar]] as Jaya Bakshi/Jaya Balraj Uppal (Jane Bennet), Lalita's older sister\n* [[Meghna Kothari]] as Maya Bakshi (Mary Bennet), Lalita's younger sister\n* [[Peeya Rai Chowdhary]] as Lakhi Bakshi (Lydia Bennet), Lalita's youngest sister\n* [[Indira Varma]] as Kiran (Caroline Bingley), Balraj's sister \n* [[Daniel Gillies]] as Johnny Wickham (George Wickham), Will's former friend\n* [[Sonali Kulkarni]] as Chandra Lamba (Charlotte Lucas), Lalita's best friend\n* [[Nitin Ganatra]] as Kohli Saab (Mr William Collins)\n* [[Alexis Bledel]] as Georgina \"Georgie\" Darcy (Georgiana Darcy), Will's sister\n* [[Marsha Mason]] as Catherine Darcy, (Catherine de Bourgh), Will's mother\n* [[Shivani Ghai]] as Bride, Lalita's and Chandra's best friend\n* [[Georgina Chapman]] as Anne, Will's former girlfriend\n* [[Harvey Virdi]] as Mrs Lamba, Chandra's mother\n* Mellan Mitchell as Bijili, Bakshi's servant\n* Rick Warden as Neighbor\n* [[Ashanti (singer)|Ashanti]] as herself in a special guest appearance\n\n==Soundtrack==\nThe songs were composed by Anu Malik.
