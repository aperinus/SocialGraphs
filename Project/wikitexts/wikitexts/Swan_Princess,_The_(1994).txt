At the celebration of Odette's birth, the two make a plan to have them meet and spend every summer together in hopes that they fall in love and marry so that they can unite their two kingdoms forever. Meanwhile, the sorcerer Rothbart plans to take King William's kingdom for himself by mastering a type of [[Black magic|dark magic]] known as The Forbidden Arts. However, William discovers his plans and Rothbart is arrested. Despite calls for his death, King William spares Rothbart's life and banishes him forever. Before leaving, Rothbart swears revenge on King William, that he'll get his powers back and claim everything William has as his own.\n\nWilliam and Uberta put their plan into action. Unfortunately, this fails as Derek and Odette hate each other as children, but when they reach adulthood, they do fall in love. However, Derek can't think of anything besides Odette's beauty that he loves her for, causing her to reject him, and she and her father leave disappointed. On their journey home, they are ambushed by Rothbart, who got his powers back and transforms into a \"Great Animal\", kidnapping Odette and fatally injuring William. Derek arrives on the scene and the dying William tells him about the Great Animal (\"It's not what it seems\"), and that Odette is gone. After searching and finding no sign of Odette, the entire kingdom assumes that she is dead. Uberta tries to encourage her son to find another princess, but Derek is determined to find Odette, believing that she is still alive somewhere.\n\nDerek and his best friend Bromley practice hunting every day in preparation to face the Great Animal, with help from Uberta's [[valet]], Lord Rogers. Elsewhere, Rothbart is keeping Odette captive at the mysterious Swan Lake. After she refuses to marry him, he has cast a powerful spell that turns Odette into a [[swan]] during the day, while she can temporarily return to her true form at night if she stands on the lake when the moonlight touches it. During her captivity, she befriends a [[turtle]] named Speed, a French [[frog]] named Jean-Bob, who claims to be [[The Frog Prince|a prince]], and an Irish [[puffin]] named [[Lieutenant]] Puffin.\n\nPuffin and Odette (in her swan form) fly together to find Derek. By chance, they stumble upon Derek in the woods as he is searching for the Great Animal. Derek mistakes Odette for the Great Animal (having deduced that the creature is a [[shapeshifter]]), and tries to kill her. The ensuing chase leads Derek to Swan Lake, where he witnesses Odette reverting to a human when the moon rises. The two share a loving reunion, and Odette tells Derek that to break the spell, he must make a vow of everlasting love and \"prove it to the world\". Derek invites Odette to the ball at the castle the following night, hoping to declare to the world of his love for her. After Derek leaves however, Rothbart arrives, having heard the whole conversation, and tells Odette that she will never make it to the ball, for there will be [[new moon|\"no moon\"]] on that night. To make matters worse, Rothbart transforms his cheerful hag sidekick, Bridget, into a [[doppelg\u00e4nger]] Odette, so as to fool Derek to make his vow to the wrong woman, which will kill the real Odette. On the night of the ball, Rothbart imprisons Odette (in swan form) in the dungeon of his castle, along with Bromley, whom he had found in the woods the other night, while the disguised Bridget arrives at the ball and dances with Derek, who is unaware of her true identity.\n\nMeanwhile, Puffin, Speed, and Jean-Bob manage to free Odette from the dungeon through a duel with two hungry [[alligator]]s and she flies to the castle to warn Derek, but is too late; Derek has made the vow to the wrong woman. Just then, Rothbart bursts in, gloatingly revealing to Derek the fake Odette's true form. Realizing his mistake, Derek follows Odette back to Swan Lake, where she finally transforms back into her human form one last time. As he holds Odette in his arms, she tells Derek that she loves him before finally dying. A heartbroken and enraged Derek confronts Rothbart, demanding that he undo the spell, and Rothbart promises to do so, but only if Derek defeats him. Rothbart transforms into the Great Animal, and a battle ensues in which he overpowers Derek. However, Odette's animal friends retrieve Derek's bow, and Bromley, who has also escaped the dungeon, provides Derek with a single arrow, which Derek shoots into Rothbart's heart, instantly killing him.\n\nAfterwards, Derek tearfully confesses his love to Odette, realizing that it's the person Odette has become he loves about her, and she comes back to life; the spell on her is broken. Derek and Odette get married and they, along with Rogers, Bromley, Uberta, King William's servants, and the animals move into Rothbart's former castle. Meanwhile, Bridget redeems herself and falls in love with Uberta's [[Lackey (manservant)|lackey]], Sir Chamberlain, Puffin becomes the general of an army of swans, Odette kisses Jean-Bob who goes into convulsions but does not turn into a prince, and Odette and Derek live happily ever after.\n\n== Voice cast ==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Michelle Nicastro]] as Princess Odette\n** [[Liz Callaway]] as Princess Odette (singing voice)\n** Adrian Zahiri as Young Princess Odette\n* [[Howard McGillin]] as Prince Derek\n** [[Adam Wylie]] as Young Prince Derek\n* [[John Cleese]] as Jean-Bob\n** [[David Zippel]] as Jean-Bob (singing voice)\n* [[Steven Wright]] as Lorenzo Trudgealong (aka Speed)\n** [[Jonathan Hadary]] as Speed (singing voice)\n* [[Steve Vinovich]] as [[Lieutenant]]/[[General]] [[Puffin]]\n* [[Jack Palance]] as Sir Rothbart\n** [[Lex de Azevedo]] as Sir Rothbart (singing voice)\n* [[Sandy Duncan]] as Queen Uberta\n* [[James Arrington]] as Sir Chamberlain\n** [[Davis Gaines]] as Sir Chamberlain (singing voice)\n* [[Dakin Matthews]] as King William\n* [[Mark Harelik]] as Lord Rogers\n* [[Joel McKinnon Miller]] as Bromley\n* Bess Hopper as Bridget\n* Brian Nissen as the Narrator\n}}\n\n== Production ==\nHaving previously directed ''[[The Fox and the Hound]]'' (1981) and ''[[The Black Cauldron (film)|The Black Cauldron]]'' (1985) at [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Walt Disney Feature Animation]] in Burbank, California, Richard Rich was slated to co-direct ''[[Oliver & Company]]'' (1988) until he was fired by Disney feature animation president [[Peter Schneider (film executive)|Peter Schneider]].<ref>{{cite AV media|people=[[Don Hahn|Hahn, Don]]|title=[[Waking Sleeping Beauty]]|medium=Documentary film|publisher=Stone Circle Pictures/Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures|location=Burbank, California|date=2009}}</ref> Following his departure from Disney, he subsequently formed his own studio, Rich Animation Studios with about 26 employees, in which most of his key employees came from [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]], including the company's marketing chief, Matt Mazer.<ref>{{cite news|last=Citron|first=Rich|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1993-12-21-fi-4238-story.html|title=Rich Hopes to Strike It in Animation|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=December 21, 1993|access-date=February 6, 2018}}</ref> Subsequently, Jared F.
