Fraser also wrote the screenplay for the film adaptation. The film version follows the storyline of the original play fairly closely: a [[gay]] man and his [[heterosexual]], female roommate try (who sexually experiments by having sex with a lesbian) to find love and sexual gratification in [[Edmonton]], as a [[serial killer]] is loose in the city.\n\nWhile the film was shot on location in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]], the original stage play and the screenplay are both set in [[Edmonton]], [[Alberta]]. There are attempts made in the dialogue, props and background film footage to identify the city as Edmonton, as in David's remark, \"Let's order a Rosebowl pizza and discuss your sexual crises\" (Rose Bowl Pizza is a well-known restaurant and bar in Edmonton). In another scene, the TV news reporter signs off from \"CFR-\" and gets cut off by the TV remote control before she can say \"-N\", the final call letter of [[CFRN-TV|Edmonton's CTV affiliate station]]. Sal's remark, \"It's chicken night at Flash\", is an allusion to Flashbacks, a long-gone Edmonton [[gay bar]]. There's also repeated use of a ''Sun'' newspaper (the ''[[Edmonton Sun]]'' is one of the city's major daily newspapers, although the city's name is not included in the masthead of the prop paper) and [[CBC Television|CBC]]-TV [[Canadian Football League]] footage of an [[Edmonton Eskimos]] game.\n\nFraser won a [[Genie Award]] for his adapted screenplay,<ref>William H. New (editor) {{google books|Mkh2vJ_9GpEC|Encyclopedia of Literature in Canada|page=392}}</ref><ref>Brad Fraser {{google books|rTU2DwAAQBAJ|Kill Me Now|page=6}}</ref> while stars [[Mia Kirshner]], [[Joanne Vannicola]] and [[Matthew Ferguson]] received acting nominations.\n\nIn 2011 it was finally released on [[DVD region code#1|Region 1]] [[DVD]] from Sony Pictures Classic's MOD service. It is also available in the UK on a Region 0 (\"region-free\") [[PAL]] DVD issued by [[Arrow Films]].\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Thomas Gibson]] as David Mc Millan \n* [[Ruth Marshall]] as Candy\n* [[Cameron Bancroft (actor)|Cameron Bancroft]] as Bernie\n* [[Mia Kirshner]] as Benita\n* [[Joanne Vannicola]] as Jerri\n* [[Matthew Ferguson]] as Kane\n* [[Aidan Devine]] as Sal\n}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Amg movie|148444|Love and Human Remains}}\n* {{IMDb title|id=0107447|title=Love and Human Remains}}\n* {{rotten tomatoes|love_and_human_remains}}\n* {{Mojo title|loveandhumanremains}}\n\n{{Denys Arcand}}\n<!-- Please do not remove the 3 primary film categories -Year, Country, Language -->\n<!-- end of primary film categories -->\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Love And Human Remains}}\n[[Category:1993 films]]\n[[Category:1993 comedy-drama films]]\n[[Category:1993 LGBT-related films]]\n[[Category:1990s English-language films]]\n[[Category:1990s serial killer films]]\n[[Category:Canadian comedy-drama films]]\n[[Category:Canadian LGBT-related films]]\n[[Category:Canadian serial killer films]]\n[[Category:English-language Canadian films]]\n[[Category:Gay-related films]]\n[[Category:Lesbian-related films]]\n[[Category:LGBT-related comedy-drama films]]\n[[Category:Films based on Canadian plays]]\n[[Category:Films set in Edmonton]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Montreal]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Denys Arcand]]\n[[Category:1990s Canadian films]]\n\n\n{{1990s-Canada-film-stub}}\n{{1990s-comedy-drama-film-stub}}\n{{LGBT-film-stub}}"}]}}}}
