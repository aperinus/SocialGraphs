Mascelli]]. It is perhaps better known under its TV release title, '''''The Atomic Brain'''''. The film stars [[Marjorie Eaton]], [[Frank Gerstle]], [[Erika Peters]], and Xerxes the cat. It tells the story of a wealthy elderly woman who wants to have her brain transplanted into the head of a young woman, so that instead of being old, ugly, and rich, she can be young, beautiful, and rich. Things do not go according to plan, however. Co-producer and co-writer Dean Dillman, Jr.,the older brother of actor [[Bradford Dillman]], narrated the film.\n\n==Plot==\nIn an atomic-powered laboratory beneath the mansion of the elderly, unpleasant, and very rich Mrs. Hettie March (Eaton), Dr. Otto Frank (Gerstle) is experimenting with brain transplantation. Things are not going very well, though, as all Dr. Frank has succeeded in creating so far is Hans, a snarling man-beast with a dog's brain, and the \"Walking Corpse\" - a pretty young woman ([[Margie Fisco]]) who wanders about the lab with a brain-dead glassy-eyed stare. Dr. Frank's goal is to carry out the wishes of Mrs. March and transplant her brain into the head of a beautiful younger woman.\n\nTo that end, Mrs. March advertises for domestic help and hires Nina Rhodes (Peters) from Austria, Bea Mullins ([[Judy Bamber]]) from England, and Anita Gonzales ([[Lisa Lang]]) from Mexico. Mrs. March plans to pick out the best-looking of the three and use her as a body donor so that she will become one of the richest and most beautiful young women in the world. She rejects Anita because the birthmark on her back makes her imperfect and chooses the curvaceous blonde Bea instead.\n\nAnita is turned over to Dr. Frank for experimentation, and he transplants the brain of Xerxes the cat into her head. Anita immediately takes on the aspects of cat behavior: purring, hissing, eating mice, etc. Neither Nina nor Bea know what has happened to Anita, and when Bea comes across her, she scratches out one of Bea's eyes. Nina finds Anita on the roof of the mansion and attempts to get her down, but Anita loses her footing and falls to her death.\n\nBecause of Bea's injury, Nina becomes by default the choice for Mrs. March's new body. However, Dr. Frank takes pity on Nina and instead transplants Mrs. March's brain into Xerxes. Now a cat, Mrs. March is quite unhappy about this unexpected development, and after scratching Dr. Frank's hand in anger, locks him inside his atomic-powered experimental chamber when he enters it. Xerxes/Mrs. March then starts the chamber, which quickly reduces Dr. Frank to a skeleton, and also begins the chain reaction in the atomic pile below the lab that will cause it to explode, destroying all evidence of the lab and burning the mansion to the ground.\n\nA half-blind Bea stumbles into the lab to rescue Nina. But as the lab starts coming apart, Bea is killed when a piece of machinery falls on her. Nina flees into the night, unaware that following silently behind her is Xerxes/Mrs. March, waiting for a chance to someday, somehow claim Nina's body as her own.\n\n==Cast==\n''Credited''\n\n* [[Marjorie Eaton]] as Mrs. Hettie March\n* [[Frank Gerstle]] as Dr. Otto Frank\n* Frank Fowler as Victor\n* [[Erika Peters]] as Nina Rhodes\n* [[Judy Bamber]] as Bea Mullins\n* Lisa Lang as Anita Gonzalez\n* Xerxes as The Cat\n\n''Uncredited''\n\n* [[Margie Fisco]] as the Walking Corpse\n* Unnamed Actor as Hans\n* Unnamed Actor as the Night Watchman\n* [[Bradford Dillman]] as the Narrator\n\n== Production ==\nIn an interview with film historian Tom Weaver, Pollexfen said that ''Monstrosity'' \"was shot around '58, with fundamentally an amateur cast.\" It was originally budgeted at $25,000 but ended up with a final cost of \"around $40,000,\" and was the only film he was connected with that never made a profit. Pollexfen said that \"''Everything'' went wrong\" with the making of the movie. He called it \"certainly the worst picture I was ever involved with\" and his least favorite of the movies he had worked on.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|last=Weaver|first=Tom|title=Return of the B Science Fiction and Horror Heroes: The Mutant Melding of Two Volumes of Classic Interviews|publisher=McFarland & Company Inc.|year=2000|isbn=0786407557|location=Jefferson NC|pages=282}}</ref>\n\n== Release ==\nAccording to the [[American Film Institute]], ''Monstrosity'' was released to theatres in September 1963.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Monstrosity|url=https://www.catalog.afi.com/Search?searchField=MovieName&searchText=Monstrosity&sortType=sortByRelevance|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=7 November 2020|website=American Film Institute}}</ref> However, it was not reviewed by ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' until after a screening at a Hollywood theatre on 9 December 1964, some 15 months after its stated release.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|editor-last=Willis|editor-first=Don|title=Variety's Complete Science Fiction Reviews|publisher=Garland Publishing Inc.|year=1985|isbn=0824087127|location=NY|pages=183}}</ref> And as part of a question that Weaver asked Pollexfen in the interview, Weaver referred to the film as being released \"around 1964,\" approximately six years after it was made in 1958.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Distribution ==\n''Monstrosity'' was called a \"classic of hack cinema\" in advance of its showing at The Oaks Creek Theatre in Oakmont PA on 20 October 2020.<ref>{{Cite web|title=The Oaks Creek Theatre Presents: Classic Horror Film Festival|url=https://www.showclix.com/event/monstrosity|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=7 November 2020|website=Showclix}}</ref> As ''The Atomic Brain'', it was shown on TV Channel 19 in Murrysville PA on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday, the 24th, 25th, and 26 July 2020 as part of the series ''[[Lord Blood-Rah's Nerve Wrackin' Theatre]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|date=24 July 2020|title=Calendar|url=https://www.murrysvilleparecreation.com/calendar.aspx?view=list&year=2020&month=7&day=24|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=10 November 2020|website=Murrysville PA Recreation}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|date=25 July 2020|title=Calendar|url=https://www.murrysvilleparecreation.com/calendar.aspx?view=list&year=2020&month=7&day=25|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=10 November 2020|website=Murrysville PA Recreation}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|date=26 July 2020|title=Calendar|url=https://www.murrysvileparecreation.com/calendar.aspx?view=list&year=2020&month=7&day=26|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=10 November 2020|website=Murrysville PA Recreation}}</ref>\n\nThe film has been released on DVD for home viewing on numerous occasions, including as part of \"Mill Creek Entertainment's 2007 100 Movie Packs of Sci-Fi Classics and Horror Classics.\"<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|last=Noonan|first=Bonnie|title=Gender in Science Fiction Films 1964-1979: A Critical Study|publisher=McFarland & Company Inc.|year=2015|isbn=9780786459742|location=Jefferson NC|pages=128\u2013129}}</ref> It was also in ''The Monster Collection: 16 Movies'', a three-disc set from [[Echo Bridge Home Entertainment]], released on 1 September 2015, and again on 13 September 2016 in Echo Bridge's ''The Midnight Horror Collection: Vol. 3''.

Kiss, who discusses its theatrical and TV release.\n\n== Reception ==\nAcademic Bonnie Noonan took an in-depth look at ''Monstrosity'' in her book ''Gender in Science Fiction Films 1964-1979: A Critical Study''. She notes that both women and men are portrayed in ways that are stereotypically gendered. The film devalues \"women of a certain age\" in the form of Mrs. March, who wants to replace her unacceptably aging body with a younger one. But the movie \"is also critical of men.\" Victor (Frank Fowler), whom Noonan refers to as Mrs. March's \"longtime male companion,\" is \"not depicted as a man worthy of high regard.\" For example. as Victor ogles the Walking Corpse, \"a drooling girl whose dead body has been reanimated,\" he mutters lecherously, \"She doesn't have a brain. Might be advantages.\"<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n\"Bobb,\" whose review of the film is in the 16 December 1964 issue of ''Variety'', has little good to say about the movie. He writes that \"''Monstrosity'' proves its name is no misnomer\" and that it is a \"poorly acted, poorly directed and poorly written attempt to shock.\" In his opinion, \"it's difficult to distinguish the zombies from the other actors,\" and he points out that Nina, Bea, and Anita lose their foreign accents half-way through the film.\"<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nMore recent reviewers are not more favorably impressed than \"Bobb\" was. Writing in ''The Zombie Movie Encyclopedia'', academic [[Peter Dendle]] calls it a \"deservedly infamous horror\" which includes the \"earliest explicit statement that brain decay accounts for the zombie's diminished intelligence.\" Here, the Walking Corpse, a \"walking, breathing, zombie-like creature\" exhibits \"only basic motor functions\" as she \"wanders around the cellar laboratory in her white robe and bare feet with a blank stare.\"<ref>{{cite book|title=The Zombie Movie Encyclopedia|last=Dendle|first=Peter|authorlink=Peter Dendle|publisher=[[McFarland & Company]]|year=2001|pages=111\u2013112|isbn=978-0-7864-9288-6}}</ref>\n\nBut as zombies do not figure prominently in the narrative, film historian Glenn Kay categorizes ''Monstrosity'' as a \"Zombieless Zombie\" movie. He calls it \"an amusingly ridiculous drive-in effort,\" a film that is \"so bad, it's good.\"<ref>{{Cite book|last=Kay|first=Glenn|title=Zombie Movies: The Ultimate Guide|publisher=Chicago Review Press Inc.|year=2008|isbn=9781556527708|location=Chicago|pages=322, 325}}</ref>\n\nFilm historian Jamie Russell also finds little that makes a favorable impression. He writes that the only monstrosities to be seen are \"a woman with a cat's brain, a man with a dog's brain and a zombified chick whose cerebral matter is no longer firing on all cylinders.\" Similar to Kay, he calls it \"trash cinema\" but \"not without perverse enjoyment.\"<ref>{{Cite book|last=Russell|first=Jamie|title=Book of the Dead: The Complete History of Zombie Cinema|publisher=Titan Boks|year=2014|isbn=9781781169254|location=London|pages=290\u2013291}}</ref>\n\nCritic Mike Bogue writes that \"Probably the best thing about the movie is its length, just a little over an hour. While not as howlingly awful like ''[[The Beast of Yucca Flats]]'' [1961], ''Monstrosity'' is still tough sledding. However, the actors are fairly good for this type of movie.\" He also notes that while \"Hans is the titular ''Monstrosity'' (...) viewers may feel that the real monstrosity is the film itself.\"<ref>{{Cite book|last=Bogue|first=Mike|title=Apocalypse Then: American and Japanese Atomic Cinema 1951-1967|publisher=McFarland & Company Inc.|year=2017|isbn=9781476668413|location=Jefferson NC|pages=73}}</ref>\n\nElsewhere, special mention is made of \"impromptu cat performer\" Xerxes, the film's \"featured feline.\" The anonymous reviewer points out that Xerxes, already with Mrs. March's brain, provides the climax of the movie as she/he \"takes advantage of Dr. Frank entering his atomic chamber by locking him in and flipping the switch, frying the man alive.\"<ref>{{Cite web|date=19 October 2019|title=Monstrosity (1963)|url=https://www.cinemacats.com/monstrosity-1963/|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=5 November 2020|website=Cinema Cats}}</ref>\n\nIn ''Zombiemania: 80 Movies to Die For'', academic and author Arnold T.
