A Dinosaur's Story''''' is a 1993 American-British [[animated film|animated]] [[Adventure film|adventure]] [[comedy film]] based on the 1987 [[Hudson Talbott]] [[We're Back! A Dinosaur's Story (book)|children's book of the same name]]. It depicts four intelligent [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphize]]d prehistoric reptiles, ''[[Tyrannosaurus|Tyrannosaurus rex]]'' Rex, ''[[Triceratops]]'' Woog, ''[[Pteranodon]]'' Elsa, and ''[[Parasaurolophus]]'' Dweeb (all [[dinosaur]]s save for Elsa, a [[pterosaur]]), in their journey to the [[American Museum of Natural History|Museum of Natural History]]. The [[Prehistory|prehistoric]] beings have travelled to the present day and become intelligent by eating a \"Brain Grain\" cereal invented by scientist Captain Neweyes, who wants dinosaurs to be personally seen by children. They face two major conflicts: an attempt not to be noticed by the public, and to not be exploited by Neweyes' evil twin brother Professor Screweyes, who wants to use the dinosaurs for his circus business. The dinosaurs are helped along by two runaway children, Louie and Cecilia.\n\nProduced by [[Steven Spielberg]]'s [[Amblimation]] animation studio and distributed by [[Universal Pictures]], ''We're Back! A Dinosaur's Story'' was directed by Dick Zondag, [[Ralph Zondag]], [[Phil Nibbelink]], and [[Simon Wells]] from a screenplay by [[John Patrick Shanley]]. Universal bought the rights to the novel only months after its publication, and Amblimation began storyboarding the adaptation in 1990 during the production of ''[[An American Tail: Fievel Goes West]]'' (1991). The film features the voices of [[John Goodman]], Ren\u00e9 Le Vant, [[Felicity Kendal]], [[Charles Fleischer]], [[Walter Cronkite]], [[Jay Leno]], Joey Shea, [[Julia Child]], [[Kenneth Mars]], [[Yeardley Smith]], [[Martin Short]], [[Blaze Berdahl]], and [[Rhea Perlman]].\n\n''We're Back! A Dinosaur's Story'' was released during a surge of the dinosaur in pop culture known as the [[dinosaur renaissance]]; it was released the same year as another Spielberg dinosaur flick, ''[[Jurassic Park]]'', and was marketed as the more family-friendly equivalent. Despite the dinosaur mania, it [[Box-office bomb|did not perform well at the box office]], grossing $9.3 million against a $20 million budget. It received mixed reviews from critics: while its voice cast and animation were praised, most criticisms targeted the script, particularly its story, pacing, and lack of character development.\n\n==Plot==\nA scientist, Captain Neweyes, wants children of the present day to see real dinosaurs from the [[Mesozoic era]]. He and his  [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]] assistant Vorb go back in time to collect dinosaurs, give them the cereal 'Brain Grain' to bestow them sentience, and send them to the present day. The dinosaurs Neweyes has collected include an orange ''[[Tyrannosaurus|Tyrannosaurus rex]]'' named Rex, a blue ''[[Triceratops]]'' named Woog, a purple ''[[Pteranodon]]'' named Elsa, and a green ''[[Parasaurolophus]]'' named Dweeb. Neweyes welcomes them aboard his ship, explains his plan to take them to Dr. Julia Bleeb, who will guide them to the [[American Museum of Natural History|Museum of Natural History]], and warns them to avoid Professor Screweyes, his nefarious twin brother who causes mischief after having lost his left eye several years ago.\n\nNeweyes drops the dinosaurs in the [[Hudson River]] in the year 1993 AD, but they are unable to meet up with Dr. Bleeb. They encounter two children willing to help them find the museum \u2013 a boy named Louie, who is running away to join the circus, and a girl named Cecilia. To avoid being noticed as real dinosaurs, they disguise themselves as animatronics in the [[Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade]]. The illusion falls apart, however, when Rex accidentally deflates an ''[[Apatosaurus]]'' balloon after singing the movie's theme song during the parade thus blowing their cover. The citizens panic and the dinosaurs flee to [[Central Park]] while being pursued by the police and the army.\n\nMeanwhile, Louie and Cecilia meet Professor Screweyes, who is running the horror-themed \"Eccentric Circus\". Unaware of Screweyes' dark nature, the children sign a contract to perform in his troupe. When the dinosaurs arrive to save Louie and Cecilia, Screweyes [[Devolution (biology)|devolves]] the children into [[chimpanzee]]s using \"Brain Drain\", pills that are the polar opposite of Brain Grain. The dinosaurs consume the pills, which cause them to lose their intelligence and revert to their natural forms, in exchange for Screweyes restoring Louie and Cecilia to humans and releasing them. The next morning, a [[clown]] named Stubbs, who works for Professor Screweyes, informs the two kids about Screweyes' plan to exploit the dinosaurs for their scare potential.\n\nThat night, Louie and Cecilia sneak into the circus, where the dinosaurs perform their terrifying act \u2013 Screweyes hypnotizing Rex \u2013 before the trick is hindered by a [[crow]] turning on flares. Rex grabs and prepares to eat Screweyes, but Louie steps in and talks the Tyrannosaurus out of his vengeance. His and Cecilia's impassioned pleas and loving touch restore the dinosaurs' sentience. Stubbs resigns from Professor Screweyes' employment, and Captain Neweyes arrives in his ship to lift the kids and the dinosaurs out of the circus, leaving Screweyes to be devoured by crows. The dinosaurs spend the rest of their lives in the museum, fulfilling Neweyes' plan, while Louie and Cecilia reconcile with their respective parents and become a couple.\n\n==Voice cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[John Goodman]] as Rex, a kind ''[[Tyrannosaurus|Tyrannosaurus rex]]''.\n* [[Ren\u00e9 Le Vant]] as Woog, a gluttonous ''[[Triceratops]]''.\n* [[Felicity Kendal]] as Elsa, an elegant ''[[Pteranodon]]''.\n* [[Charles Fleischer]] as Dweeb, a half-witted ''[[Parasaurolophus]]''; (originally intended to be an ''[[Apatosaurus]]'').\n* [[Walter Cronkite]] as Captain Neweyes, an inventor who brings the dinosaurs to the present.\n* [[Jay Leno]] as Vorb, an alien that works for Captain Neweyes.\n* [[Joey Shea]] as Louie, a brave young boy from a lower-class background who runs away to join a circus.\n* [[Julia Child]] as Dr. Juliet Bleeb, a worker at the Museum of Natural History.\n* [[Kenneth Mars]] as Professor Screweyes, Captain Neweyes' evil twin brother who runs a circus.\n* [[Yeardley Smith]] as Cecilia Nuthatch, a young girl from a wealthy family who is neglected by her parents.\n* [[Martin Short]] as Stubbs the Clown, a clown who used to work for Professor Screweyes.\n* [[Blaze Berdahl]] as Buster the Bird, a bird who is running away from home and is told the film's plot by Rex.\n* [[Rhea Perlman]] as Buster's Mother\n{{div col end}}\n\n== Production ==\n[[File:Phil Nibbelink.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Phil Nibbelink]] in 2013.
