It was based on [[Charles R. Jackson]]'s [[The Lost Weekend (novel)|novel of the same name]] about an [[Alcoholism|alcoholic]] writer. The film was nominated for seven [[Academy Awards]] and won four: [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]], [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]], and [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Adapted Screenplay]]. It also shared the Grand Prix at the first [[Cannes Film Festival]], making it one of only three films\u2014the other two being ''[[Marty (film)|Marty]]'' (1955) and ''[[Parasite (2019 film)|Parasite]]'' (2019)\u2014to win both the Academy Award for Best Picture and the highest award at Cannes.\n\nOn review aggregator [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film has an approval rating of 97% based on 70 reviews, with an average rating of 8.4/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \"Director Billy Wilder's unflinchingly honest look at the effects of alcoholism may have had some of its impact blunted by time, but it remains a powerful and remarkably prescient film.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/lost_weekend |title=The Lost Weekend (1945) |work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |publisher=[[Fandango Media|Fandango]] |access-date=January 31, 2022}}</ref> In 2011, The film was selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.\"<ref>{{Cite web|title=With \"20,000 Leagues,\" the National Film Registry Reaches 700|url=https://www.loc.gov/item/prn-16-209/with-20000-leagues-the-national-film-registry-reaches-700/2016-12-14/|access-date=2020-11-24|website=Library of Congress}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Complete National Film Registry Listing |url=https://www.loc.gov/programs/national-film-preservation-board/film-registry/complete-national-film-registry-listing/|access-date=2020-11-24|website=Library of Congress}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nOn Thursday, alcoholic New York writer Don Birnam is packing for a weekend vacation with his brother Wick. When Don's girlfriend Helen drops by with two tickets for a concert that day, Don suggests that Wick attend with Helen. Knowing they had disposed of all the liquor Don had hidden in the apartment and thinking he has no money for more, they go to the concert.\n\nAfter finding ten dollars that Wick left for the cleaning lady, Don heads for Nat's Bar, calling in at a liquor store to purchase two bottles of rye on the way.  Don intends to be back home in time to meet Wick and catch their train, but he loses track of time due to his drinking. When he arrives home, he sees Wick leaving and Helen saying she will stay and wait for Don. Don  sneaks back into the flat, where he hides one of his bottles of liquor and drinks the other one.\n\nOn Friday, back at Nat's Bar, Nat criticizes Don for treating Helen so badly. Don tells Nat that he intends to write a novel about his battle with alcoholism, called ''The Bottle''. He recalls how he first met Helen at the opera house, where the cloakroom mixed up their coats. He and Helen struck up a romance, and he remained sober during this time. When he goes to meet her parents, he overhears them talking about him being unemployed, wondering if he is good enough for their daughter. He loses his nerve and sneaks off. She goes to his flat, where Wick tries to cover for him, but Don confesses that he is two people: \"Don the writer\", whose fear of failure causes him to drink, and \"Don the drunk\" who always has to be bailed out by Wick. Helen devotes herself to helping him.\n\nAfter telling Nat the story behind his proposed novel, Don heads back home to begin writing it. However, his alcohol cravings get the better of him and he begins a desperate search for the other bottle from the previous night, which he knows he has hidden away somewhere. After failing to find it, he visits another bar, where he is thrown out after trying to steal from a woman's purse because he didn't have enough to pay the bill. Back in his flat, he finds the bottle he had hidden and drinks himself into a stupor.\n\nOn Saturday, Don is broke and tries to pawn his typewriter so he can buy more alcohol, but the pawnshops are closed for [[Yom Kippur]]. Desperate for money, he visits Gloria, a prostitute who has a crush on him. She gives him some money, but he falls down her stairs and is knocked unconscious.\n\nOn Sunday, Don wakes up in an alcoholics' ward where nurse Bim Nolan mocks him and other guests at \"Hangover Plaza\".  Bim offers to help cure his [[delirium tremens]], but Don refuses help and escapes while the staff are occupied with a raving, violent patient.\n\nOn Monday, Don steals a bottle of whisky from a store after threatening the owner, and spends the day drinking. Suffering from delirium tremens, he hallucinates a nightmarish scene in which a bat flies in his window and kills a mouse, spilling its blood. Helen then returns.  Finding Don collapsed and in a delirious state, she stays overnight on his couch.\n\nOn Tuesday morning, Don slips out and pawns Helen's coat, the one that had brought them together. She trails him to the pawn shop and learns from the pawnbroker that he traded the coat for his gun, for which he has bullets at home. She races to Don's apartment and interrupts him just before he is about to shoot himself. As she pleads with him, Nat arrives to return Don's typewriter. After Nat leaves, Helen convinces him that \"Don the writer\" and \"Don the drunk\" are the same person. He commits to writing his novel ''The Bottle'', dedicated to her, which will recount the events of the weekend. He drops a cigarette into a glass of whiskey to make it undrinkable as evidence of his resolve.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Ray Milland]] as Don Birnam\n* [[Jane Wyman]] as Helen St. James\n* [[Phillip Terry]] as Wick Birnam\n* [[Howard Da Silva]] as Nat\n* [[Doris Dowling]] as Gloria\n* [[Frank Faylen]] as 'Bim' Nolan, the ward nurse\n* [[Mary Young (actress)|Mary Young]] as Mrs. Deveridge\n* [[Anita Sharp-Bolster|Anita Bolster]] as Mrs. Foley\n* [[Lilian Fontaine]] as Mrs. St. James\n* [[Frank Orth]] as Opera Cloak Room Attendant\n* [[Lewis Russell]] as Mr. St. James\n* [[Harry Tenbrook]] as Drunk in Alcoholic Ward (uncredited)\n}}\n\n==Production and notable features==\nWilder was originally drawn to this material after having worked with [[Raymond Chandler]] on the screenplay for ''[[Double Indemnity (1944 film)|Double Indemnity]]''. Chandler was a recovering alcoholic at the time, and the stress and tumultuous relationship with Wilder during the collaboration caused him to start drinking again. Wilder made the film, in part, to try to explain Chandler to himself.<ref name=\"dvd2\">{{cite news | title = Shadows of Suspense | work = Double Indemnity Universal Legacy Series DVD | publisher = [[Universal Studios]] | year = 2006}}</ref>\n\nWilder originally wanted [[Jose Ferrer]] for the role of Don, but he turned it down. Charles Brackett's first choice for playing Helen was [[Olivia de Havilland]], but she was involved with a lawsuit that prevented her from being in any film at that time.  It has been said that [[Katharine Hepburn]] and [[Jean Arthur]] were also considered for the role.<ref>Robert Osborne of [[Turner Classic Movies]]</ref>\n\nThe majority of the film was shot at Paramount studios in Hollywood. Wilder, however, insisted they shoot part of the film on location in [[New York City]] to create a distinct sense of realism. On October 1, 1944, Wilder and his small crew began filming in New York, mostly along [[Third Avenue]] in Midtown East Manhattan. To further create a realistic atmosphere, Wilder and his crew used hidden cameras, placing them behind boxes or in the back of trucks, and capturing Milland as he walked up 3rd Avenue among actual pedestrians who were unaware a film was being made. The production also had the unprecedented permission to film inside [[Bellevue Hospital]] in the alcoholic ward, a request that would be denied to future films. After completing filming in New York, the cast and crew returned to California to resume principal photography, where they recreated several New York locations, including a replica of [[P.J. Clarke's]], a tavern often frequented by author Charles Jackson.<ref name=\"phillips\">{{cite book|last1=Phillips|first1=Gene|title=Some Like It Wilder: The Life and Controversial Films of Billy Wilder|date=2010|publisher=University Press of Kentucky|isbn=978-0813173672|pages=76\u201378|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5uohNoRFkwIC&q=%22lost+weekend%22+%22third%22&pg=PT91|access-date=8 October 2017|language=en}}</ref>\n\nThe film also made famous the \"character walking toward the camera in a daze as time passes\" camera effect.\n\nOnce ''The Lost Weekend'' was completed, it was shown to a preview audience, who laughed at what they considered Milland's overwrought performance, and the studio actually considered shelving the film. Part of the problem was that the print shown at the preview didn't have [[Mikl\u00f3s R\u00f3zsa|Mikl\u00f3s R\u00f3zsa's]] original musical soundtrack, but instead had a temporary track containing upbeat jazz music. However, once the R\u00f3zsa score was in place, along with a re-shoot of the last scene, audiences and critics reacted favorably. The film's musical score was among the first to feature the [[theremin]], which was used to create the pathos of alcoholism.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://filmmusiccritics.org/ifmca-legends/miklos-rozsa/|title=MIKL\u00d3S R\u00d3ZSA|publisher=International Film Music Critics Association|access-date=3 November 2012}}</ref><ref name=\"phillips\" />\n\nRights to the film are currently held by [[Universal Studios]], which owns the pre-1950 Paramount sound feature film library via [[EMKA, Ltd.]]\n\nThe film differs significantly from the book by leaving out the novel's noted homosexual overtones, namely the strong implication that Don Birnam (as was the book's author, Charles Jackson) is a closeted homosexual.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://knopfdoubleday.com/tag/the-lost-weekend/|title='Farther and Wilder' by Blake Bailey|access-date=May 13, 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe liquor industry launched a campaign to undermine the film even before its release. Allied Liquor Industries, a national trade organization, wrote an open letter to Paramount warning that anti-drinking groups would use the film to reinstate prohibition. Liquor interests allegedly enlisted gangster [[Frank Costello]] to offer Paramount $5 million to buy the film's negative in order to burn it.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Phillips |first1=Gene |title=Some Like It Wilder: The Life and Controversial Films of Billy Wilder |date=2010 |publisher=University Press of Kentucky |isbn=9780813173672 |page=83 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5uohNoRFkwIC&pg=PT98 |access-date=16 January 2019 |language=en}}</ref> Wilder quipped that if they\u2019d offered him $5 million, \u201cI would have [burned the negative].\u201d<ref>{{cite web |last1=Terrall |first1=Ben |title=The Lost Weekend |url=http://filmnoirfoundation.org/noircitymag/The-Lost-Weekend.pdf |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20221009/http://filmnoirfoundation.org/noircitymag/The-Lost-Weekend.pdf |archive-date=2022-10-09 |url-status=live |website=filmnoirfoundation.org |access-date=16 January 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n===Box office performance===\nThe film was a commercial success.

In a spoof of ''The Lost Weekend'', Milland and Jack Benny played alcoholic twin brothers. [[Phil Harris]], who normally played Jack Benny's hard-drinking bandleader on the show, played the brother who tried to convince Ray and Jack to give up liquor. (\"Ladies and gentlemen,\" said an announcer, \"the opinions expressed by Mr. Harris are written in the script and are not necessarily his own.\") In the alcoholic ward scene, smart-aleck [[Frank Nelson (actor)|Frank Nelson]] played the ward attendant who promised Ray and Jack that they would soon start seeing DT visions of strange animals. When the DT visions appeared (with [[Mel Blanc]] providing pig squeals, monkey chatters, and other animal sound effects), Ray chased them off. \"Ray, they're gone!\", Benny shouted. \"What did you do?\" Milland replied, \"I threw my Oscar at them!\"\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{wikiquote}}\n{{commons category|The Lost Weekend (1945 film)}}\n* {{IMDb title|0037884}}\n* {{tcmdb title|81891|}}\n* {{allmovie|30170}}\n* {{AFI film|id=52300}}\n* {{rotten-tomatoes|lost_weekend|The Lost Weekend}}\n* [http://www.filmsite.org/lostw.html ''The Lost Weekend''] film review at filmsite.org\n* [https://archive.org/download/ScreenGuildTheater/Sgt_46-01-07_ep279_Lost_Weekend.mp3 ''The Lost Weekend''] on [[Screen Guild Theater]]: January 7, 1946\n\n{{Billy Wilder}}\n{{Navboxes\n|title = Awards for ''The Lost Weekend''\n|list =\n{{AcademyAwardBestPicture 1941-1960}}\n{{Palme d'Or}}\n{{Golden Globe Award Best Motion Picture Drama}}\n{{New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Film}}\n}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Lost Weekend}}\n[[Category:1945 films]]\n[[Category:1945 drama films]]\n[[Category:American drama films]]\n[[Category:American black-and-white films]]\n[[Category:Best Drama Picture Golden Globe winners]]\n[[Category:Best Picture Academy Award winners]]\n[[Category:1940s English-language films]]\n[[Category:Film noir]]\n[[Category:Films about alcoholism]]\n[[Category:Films about writers]]\n[[Category:Films based on American novels]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Billy Wilder]]\n[[Category:Films featuring a Best Actor Academy Award-winning performance]]\n[[Category:Films featuring a Best Drama Actor Golden Globe winning performance]]\n[[Category:Films produced by Charles Brackett]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Mikl\u00f3s R\u00f3zsa]]\n[[Category:Films set in Manhattan]]\n[[Category:Films set in New York City]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Los Angeles]]\n[[Category:Films shot in New York City]]\n[[Category:Films whose director won the Best Directing Academy Award]]\n[[Category:Films whose director won the Best Director Golden Globe]]\n[[Category:Films whose writer won the Best Adapted Screenplay Academy Award]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by Billy Wilder]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by Charles Brackett]]\n[[Category:Palme d'Or winners]]\n[[Category:Paramount Pictures films]]\n[[Category:United States National Film Registry films]]\n[[Category:1940s American films]]"}]}}}}
