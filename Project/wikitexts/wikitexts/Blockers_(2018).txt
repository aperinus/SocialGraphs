She watches on as Julie is befriended by two other girls, Kayla and Sam. Kayla's father Mitchell and Sam's father Hunter introduce themselves and become close friends after seeing the bond between their children.\n\nTwelve years later, Julie shares with Kayla and Sam that she plans to lose her virginity to her boyfriend Austin at [[prom]]. Kayla pledges to do so as well, though on a casual basis with her lab partner, Connor. Sam, a [[closeted]] lesbian unsure about her feelings, also joins the pact and arranges to attend the prom with the harmless Chad.\n\nLisa throws a pre-party for the parents and kids. The girls then head to the prom, texting each other about their sex pact. The three parents hear Julie's laptop and intercept the messages. Hunter deciphers their [[emoji]] codes and uncovers their plan. Lisa and Mitchell rush to stop their daughters; Hunter tries to dissuade them from interfering and shares his intuition that Sam is gay, but upon seeing her force herself to kiss Chad, he joins them to stop her from doing something she doesn't want to do.\n\nHaving been told that the after-party would be at Austin's house, the parents go there but find only Austin's parents Ron and Cathy engaging in sex games. Ron reveals that the after-party is at a lake house but refuses to give the address. The trio realizes that Mitchell's wife Marcie may have it and return to his house. They retrieve the address against Marcie's wishes, who supports their daughter's right to privacy, but are unable to catch them when the cops show up.\n\nAs the group struggles to track down their daughters, it becomes clear that each parent has their own motivation: Mitchell is in denial over his daughter growing up, Hunter feels guilty for neglecting Sam during his bitter [[marital separation|separation]] from her mother, who cheated on him, and Lisa is struggling to let go of her only child and is offended by Julie's plans to go to distant [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]] with Austin rather than a closer college she wanted; this point is proven when an angry Julie reveals she's only going to UCLA to get away from Lisa's clingyness.\n\nKnowing that Austin and Ron have been texting, the parents return to Ron's house, intending to grab his phone. After barging in on the couple playing a blindfold sex game, Hunter is forced to go along with it as Mitchell grabs the phone, which reveals that the girls are at a hotel. There a drunk Sam goes to bed with Chad but decides she does not want to have sex. Kayla and Connor go off together, but she also changes her mind and they limit their intimacy to Connor performing [[oral sex]] on Kayla.\n\nMitch finds Kayla with Connor and throws him against the wall, infuriating Kayla. Mitch confesses his struggles, his good intentions ultimately making amends with Kayla. Hunter finds Sam and they also share a tender moment, where he reveals that a good night was the best he could give her in return for his neglect. Sam comes out to her father, who is deeply moved at being the first person she told. Lisa sneaks into Julie and Austin's room and, realizing how much they clearly love each other, leaves unnoticed. Sam comes out to Julie and Kayla, who embrace her and affirm their lifelong friendships. They leave Sam with her crush Angelica who shares a romantic kiss with her. Mitch, Lisa and Hunter acknowledge their own friendships have been strengthened and drink to their daughters' futures.\n\nThree months later, Sam, Kayla, Julie and Conor ready to drive to California. As they leave, Lisa starts receiving the girls' group text, filled with plans to use drugs and have unprotected sex. The three parents run for the car only for the girls to text that it was a prank, and a final \"I love you\" to them.\n\nIn a [[post-credits scene]], Kayla walks in on Mitchell and Marcie playing a version of Austin's parents' blindfold sex game and the three scream in shock.\n\n==Cast==\n<!--- Cast per closing credits scroll --->\n* [[Leslie Mann]] as Lisa Decker, Julie's single mother.\n* [[John Cena]] as Mitchell Mannes, Kayla's headstrong father.\n* [[Ike Barinholtz]] as Hunter Lockwood, Sam's absentee divorced father.\n* [[Kathryn Newton]] as Julie Decker, Lisa's daughter.\n** Anniston Almond as 6-year-old Julie\n** Audrey Casson as 12-year-old Julie\n* [[Geraldine Viswanathan]] as Kayla Mannes, Mitchell and Marcie's daughter.\n** Noor Anna Maher as 6-year-old Kayla\n** Madeline Paris Erwin as 12-year-old Kayla\n* [[Gideon Adlon]] as Sam Lockwood, Hunter's daughter.\n** Hannah Goergen as 6-year-old Sam\n** Aburey Michele Katz as 12-year-old Sam\n* [[Ramona Young]] as Angelica, Sam's crush.\n* [[Graham Phillips (actor)|Graham Phillips]] as Austin, Julie's boyfriend.\n* [[Miles Robbins]] as Connor Aldrich, Kayla's prom date.\n* Jimmy Bellinger as Chad, Sam's fedora-wearing prom date.\n* [[Colton Dunn]] as Rudy, an overeager limo driver.\n* [[Sarayu Blue]] as Marcie Mannes, Mitchell's wife and Kayla's mother.\n* [[Gary Cole]] as Ron, Cathy's husband and Austin's father.\n* [[Gina Gershon]] as Cathy, Ron's wife and Austin's mother.\n* [[June Diane Raphael]] as Brenda Lockwood, Sam's mother and Hunter's ex-wife.\n* [[Hannibal Buress]] as Frank, Brenda's husband and Sam's stepfather.\n* Andrew Lopez as Jake Donahue\n* [[Jake Picking]] as Kyler\n* T.C.
