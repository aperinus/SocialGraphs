The film, produced by [[Charles Brackett]] and directed by [[Henry Levin (film director)|Henry Levin]], stars [[James Mason]], [[Pat Boone]], and [[Arlene Dahl]]. [[Bernard Herrmann]] wrote the film score, and the film's storyline was adapted by [[Charles Brackett]] from the 1864 [[Journey to the Center of the Earth|novel of the same name]] by [[Jules Verne]].   \n{{TOC limit|limit=2}}\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1880 [[Edinburgh]], Professor Sir Oliver Lindenbrook, a geologist at the [[University of Edinburgh]], is given a piece of [[volcanic rock]] by his admiring student, Alec McEwan. Finding the rock unusually heavy, Lindenbrook discovers a [[plumb bob]] inside bearing a cryptic inscription. Lindenbrook and Alec discover that it was left by a scientist named Arne Saknussemm, who, almost 300 years earlier, had found a passage to the center of the Earth by descending into the volcano [[Sn\u00e6fellsj\u00f6kull]], in western [[Iceland]]. After translating the message, Lindenbrook immediately sets off with Alec to follow in the Icelandic pioneer's footsteps.\n\nProfessor G\u00f6teborg, upon receiving correspondence from Lindenbrook regarding the message, attempts to reach the Earth's center first. Lindenbrook and McEwan chase him to Iceland. There, G\u00f6teborg and his assistant kidnap and imprison them in a cellar. They are freed by local Hans Bjelke and his pet duck Gertrud. They later find G\u00f6teborg dead in his hotel room. Lindenbrook finds [[potassium cyanide]] crystals in G\u00f6teborg's [[goatee]] and concludes that he was murdered.\n\nG\u00f6teborg's widow, Carla, who initially believed Lindenbrook was trying to capitalize on her deceased husband's work, learns the truth. She provides the equipment and supplies that her husband had accumulated, including much sought after [[Gas-discharge lamp#The \"Ruhmkorff\" lamp|Ruhmkorff lamp]]s, but only on the condition that she accompanies them to protect her husband's reputation. Lindenbrook grudgingly agrees. Hans and Gertrud also join the new expedition.\n\nOn a specific date, they mark the sunrise's exact location on Sn\u00e6fellsj\u00f6kull and descend into the Earth from there, following [[Trail blazing|markings]] left by Saknussemm. However, they are not alone. G\u00f6teborg's murderer, Count Saknussemm, believes that, as Saknussemm's descendant, only he has the right to be there. He and his manservant trail the group secretly. When Alec becomes separated from the others, he comes upon Saknussemm. When Alec refuses to take the place of Saknussemm's servant, who has died from overexertion, Saknussemm shoots Alec in the arm. Lindenbrook locates them through the gunshot's echoes and, after a quick trial for murder, sentences Saknussemm to death. No one is willing to execute him, however, so they reluctantly take him along.\n\nThe explorers eventually come upon a subterranean ocean. They construct a raft to cross it, but not before narrowly escaping a family of [[Dimetrodon|''dimetrodons'']]. Their raft begins circling in a large mid-ocean whirlpool. The professor deduces that this must be the center of the Earth: The magnetic forces of north and south meet there and are powerful enough to snatch away even the gold in their rings and tooth fillings. Now completely exhausted, they reach the opposite shore.\n\nWhile the others are asleep, a hungry Saknussemm catches and eats Gertrud. When Hans finds out, he rushes at the count. Reeling back, Saknussemm inadvertently loosens a column of large stones and is buried beneath them, killing him. Right behind the collapse, the group comes upon the ruins of the sunken city of [[Atlantis]]. They also find the skeleton of Arne Saknussemm, whose right hand points toward a volcanic chimney. While a strong updraft suggests it leads directly to the surface, a huge rock partially blocks the way. Lindenbrook decides to blow up the obstruction with gunpowder left by Saknussemm, and they take shelter in a large sacrificial altar bowl. A [[Megalania|giant lizard]] attacks, but is buried under molten lava released by the explosion. The bowl floats toward the passage and is driven upward at great speed by a lava plume, finally reaching the surface and ejecting the explorers.\n\nWhen they return to Edinburgh, they are hailed as heroes. Lindenbrook turns down the honors due to the loss of their documented evidence, but encourages the next generations to follow in their footsteps. Alec marries Lindenbrook's niece Jenny, and Lindenbrook and Carla kiss, a pledge of their coming wedding.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Pat Boone, Peter Ronson, James Mason, Arlene Dahl, Journey to the Center of the Earth, 1959.jpg|thumb|300px|<center>L-R: [[Pat Boone]], [[Peter Ronson]], [[James Mason]], and [[Arlene Dahl]]  </center>]]\n*  [[James Mason]] as Sir Oliver Lindenbrook \n*  [[Pat Boone]] as Alec McEwan \n*  [[Diane Baker]] as Jenny Lindenbrook\n*  [[Arlene Dahl]] as Carla G\u00f6teborg \n*  [[Peter Ronson]] as Hans Bjelke \n*  [[Thayer David]] as Count Saknussemm \n*  Bob Adler as Groom (Credited as Robert Adler)\n* [[Alan Napier]] as Dean \n* [[Ivan Triesault]] as Professor G\u00f6teborg \n* Alex Finlayson as Professor Boyle\n\n==Production==\nThe film was a co-production between 20th Century-Fox and [[Joseph M.

The serious thing about Jules Verne is that all he does is tell a story in exciting episodes, but his stories have always pushed man a little closer towards the unknown. What we've tried to do is retell his story in the best way of all - in the Verne vernacular.<ref>{{cite news|title=BRACKETT IN CITY FOR BOW OF FILM; Writer-Producer's 'Center of Earth' to Open Dec. 16 - Double Bill Today|first=Howard |last=Thompson|work=[[The New York Times]] |date= December 2, 1959 |page=55 |access-date=July 19, 2018 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1959/12/02/archives/brackett-in-city-for-bow-of-film-writerproducers-center-of-earth-to.html}}</ref></blockquote>\nBrackett called the original story \"a delightful book, written for young people. We simply couldn't have any solemnity about it. I wanted very much to do it at this time. I'm tired of all these films based on thoughts at the back of sick minds.\"<ref>A Producer Lightly Bucking the Tide: Hollywood Letter\nBy Richard Dyer MacCann. The Christian Science Monitor 19 Apr 1960: 7.</ref>\n\nThe script was written by [[Walter Reisch]] who later said:\n<blockquote>I had written a lot of science fiction for magazines, and Charles Brackett knew about that. They also knew that I had written magazine articles on Jules Verne. I had studied Jules Verne, and always wanted to write his biography, but I never got around to doing it. When they bought the Jules Verne novel from his estate and assigned me, I was delighted. The master's work, though a beautiful basic idea, went in a thousand directions and never achieved a real constructive \"roundness\". With the exception of the basic idea, there is very little of the novel left in the film. I invented a lot of new characters\u2014the Pat Boone part, the part of the professor's wife played by Arlene Dahl, the [part of the] villain\u2014and the fact that it all played in Scotland.{{sfn|McGilligan|1991|p=[http://publishing.cdlib.org/ucpressebooks/view?docId=ft0z09n7m0&chunk.id=d0e11350&toc.depth=1&toc.id=d0e11350&brand=ucpress 243]}}</blockquote> \nPat Boone was the first star announced.<ref>{{cite news|title=DIANE VARSI QUITS CAREER IN MOVIES; Actress, 20, Retiring to Live in Vermont - Boone in Film Based on Verne Book|first=Thomas M. |last=Pryor|work=[[The New York Times]]|date= March 19, 1959|page=40|access-date=July 19, 2018 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1959/03/19/archives/diane-varsi-quits-career-in-movies-actress-20-retiring-to-live-in.html}}</ref> He said he was reluctant to make the film because it was science fiction, even after Fox promised to add some songs. It was only when they offered him 15% of the profits that he agreed at the urging of his management. He said, \"Later on, I was very glad I did it, because it was fun to do, it had some good music and it became a very successful film\".{{sfn|Verswijver|2003|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=pNQylJinyQsC&pg=PA13&lpg=PA13 13]}}\n\nFollowing up on that point, ''Diabolique'' magazine later observed:\n<blockquote>It remains a mystery why Boone never appeared in another fantasy/sci-fi adventure in his entire career. Boone was believable in them, and he could easily sing a song over the credits if he wanted. He wouldn\u2019t have to worry about kissing any of his co-stars or \u201cmorality\u201d issues. And it wasn\u2019t as though Fox weren\u2019t making them. When he was under contract they turned out ''The Lost World'' (1960), ''Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea'' (1961) and ''Five Weeks in a Balloon'' (1962). The last two even featured pop stars Frankie Avalon and Fabian respectively, but no Boone. Was he too expensive? Did the dates not work out? Did he insist on playing the lead? Whatever the reason it was a great shame. For me, this is the biggest misstep Boone made in his film career.<ref>{{Cite magazine|url=https://diaboliquemagazine.com/the-surprisingly-interesting-cinema-of-pat-boone/|first=Stephen|last=Vagg|date=10 September 2019|magazine=Diabolique Magazine|title=The Surprisingly Interesting Cinema of Pat Boone}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe role of the professor was meant to be played by [[Clifton Webb]]. Reisch said:\n<blockquote>That was absolutely the most beautiful idea, because Clifton Webb had a certain tongue-in-cheek style, suited to playing a professor with crazy notions, which could be paired with Pat Boone as his favorite disciple. Every week Clifton visited Brackett's office, where we described scenes to him and he became very excited at the prospect of playing that kind of part. Maybe two or three weeks before we actually began to shoot, Clifton Webb went to the hospital for a checkup, and they never let him out. He had to undergo major surgery. Unless my memory fails me completely, it was a double hernia, and he was, as you can imagine, a very sensitive man, very touchy about sickness. He called Zanuck himself on his private line, and said he could not play the part because it was such a physical part.{{sfn|McGilligan|1991|p=[http://publishing.cdlib.org/ucpressebooks/view?docId=ft0z09n7m0&chunk.id=d0e11350&toc.depth=1&toc.id=d0e11350&brand=ucpress 243-44]}}</blockquote>\nWebb was replaced at the last minute by James Mason, who had previously appeared as Captain Nemo in Disney's earlier adaptation of Jules Verne's novel, ''[[20,000 Leagues Under the Sea (1954 film)|20,000 Leagues Under the Sea]]'' (1954).<ref>{{cite news|title=Mason to Replace Webb in Fantasy: Actor in 'Center of Earth;' Book Reveals 'True' Ingrid |last=Scheuer |first=Philip K. |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=June 17, 1959 |page=A11}}</ref> Reisch:\n<blockquote>I think it was [longtime head of Twentieth Century-Fox casting] Billy Gordon or Lew Schreiber [Twentieth Century-Fox production executive] who suggested James Mason. James Mason was, of course, British, with a beautiful voice, and he liked the idea [of the part]. He felt it was his duty as Clifton's colleague to take over. From there on it was clear sailing, except that Pat Boone had about three or four songs, if not more, and I think all of them died in the end, with the exception of one or two. The moment that Zanuck saw [their effect on] the action, those songs just fell by the wayside.{{sfn|McGilligan|1991|p=[http://publishing.cdlib.org/ucpressebooks/view?docId=ft0z09n7m0&chunk.id=d0e11350&toc.depth=1&toc.id=d0e11350&brand=ucpress 244]}}</blockquote>\nSome of the underground sequences for ''Journey to the Center of the Earth'' were filmed at [[Carlsbad Caverns National Park]].

It was a tricky thing to shoot \u2014 the raft was on a revolving platform that tilted when it went around. It had to look like we were being tossed violently. Hundreds of gallons of water were being dumped on us to simulate a stormy sea. The noise was deafening, but not enough to drown out Dahl, who started screaming as she held on for dear life. She screamed at the director, Henry Levin, 'Get me off this thing. Get me down. I'm going to pass out!' She kept yelling. Mason had little patience for it. He thought Dahl had already overplayed the role of a dainty creature when we had to wear very heavy parkas, feigning winter amid very hot July weather, for another scene (Dahl complained then of heat prostration). Mason was not amused as this time he yelled back at her, 'Shut up woman! We're going to have to do this ten times if you don't keep quiet.' We were going to have to dub dialogue anyway, and they got the shot.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://aliveeastbay.com/archives/catching-up-with-pat-boone/|title=Catching Up with Pat Boone|date=September 3, 2012|first=Joe|last=Redmond|work=ALIVE East Bay Magazine|access-date=July 19, 2018}}</ref></blockquote>\nDahl became unconscious and it took 30 minutes to revive her.<ref>{{cite news|title=Arlene Dahl Faints on Set\n|work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=August 25, 1959 |page=B2}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n===Box office===\nAt the time of release, ''Journey to the Center of the Earth'' was a financial success, grossing $10,000,000 at the box office<ref name=\"Numbers\" /> (well over its $3.44 million budget).{{sfn|Solomon|1989|p=252}}\n\n===Critical response===\nFilm [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] assigns a rating of 86% based on 29 critics, with an average rating of 7/10.
